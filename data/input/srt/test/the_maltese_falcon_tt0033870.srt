1
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:45,813
Yes, sweetheart?

2
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:48,653
A girl wants to see you.
Her name's Wonderly.

3
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:49,589
A customer?

4
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:52,856
l guess so. You'll want to see her, anyway.
She's a knockout.

5
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:55,420
Shoo her in, Effie, darling. Shoo her in!

6
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:01,501
Will you come in, Miss Wonderly?

7
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,099
Thank you.

8
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,204
-Won't you sit down, Miss Wonderly?
-Thank you.

9
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,010
l inquired at the hotel
for a reliable private detective.

10
00:02:13,082 --> 00:02:14,310
They mentioned you.

11
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,353
Suppose you tell me about it
from the very beginning.

12
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,081
l'm from New York.

13
00:02:19,956 --> 00:02:21,821
l'm trying to find my sister.

14
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:24,084
l believe she's here in San Francisco...

15
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,095
...with a man by the name of Thursby,
Floyd Thursby.

16
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:30,299
l don't know where she met him.

17
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:33,266
We've never been as close
as sisters ought to be.

18
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:36,896
lf we had, Corinne would have told me
that she was running away with him.

19
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:40,306
Mother and Father are in Honolulu.
l must find her before they return.

20
00:02:40,376 --> 00:02:43,311
-They'll be back on the 1st.
-You've had word of your sister?

21
00:02:43,546 --> 00:02:45,844
A letter from her about two weeks ago.

22
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,315
lt said nothing except
that she was all right.

23
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:50,579
l sent a telegram begging her
to come home.

24
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:53,588
l sent it to a general delivery address,
the only one she gave.

25
00:02:53,656 --> 00:02:57,217
l waited a week and no answer came
so l decided to come out here myself.

26
00:02:57,293 --> 00:03:00,228
l wrote her that l was coming.
l shouldn't have, should l?

27
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:02,662
lt's not always easy to know what to do.

28
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:04,130
You haven't found her?

29
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,296
No. l told her in my letter that l'd be at
the St. Mark and for her to meet me there.

30
00:03:08,371 --> 00:03:12,171
l waited three days. She didn't come.
She didn't even send a message.

31
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:14,540
lt was horrible. Waiting.

32
00:03:15,211 --> 00:03:16,940
l sent her another letter.

33
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:19,345
Yesterday afternoon
l went to the post office.

34
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:22,646
Corinne didn't call for her mail,
but Floyd Thursby did.

35
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,083
He wouldn't tell me where Corinne was.

36
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:27,280
He said she didn't want to see me.

37
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:28,881
l can't believe that.

38
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,392
He promised to bring her to the hotel
if she'd come.

39
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,988
He said he knew she wouldn't.
He promised to come if she didn't.

40
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,558
Excuse me.

41
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:40,099
lt's all right, Miles. Come in.

42
00:03:40,236 --> 00:03:42,636
Miss Wonderly, my partner, Miles Archer.

43
00:03:43,373 --> 00:03:46,672
Miss Wonderly's sister ran away
with a fellow named Thursby.

44
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:48,506
They're here in San Francisco.

45
00:03:48,578 --> 00:03:50,910
Miss Wonderly has a date
with Thursby tonight.

46
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,710
Maybe he'll bring the sister.
The chances are he won't.

47
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:57,685
Miss Wonderly wants us to find the sister,
get her away from him and back home.

48
00:03:57,754 --> 00:03:59,153
-Right?
-Yes.

49
00:04:00,857 --> 00:04:04,088
Now it's simply a matter of having a man
at the hotel tonight...

50
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,594
...to shadow him when he leads us
to your sister.

51
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,723
lf, after we've found her,
she still won't leave him...

52
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,365
...well, we have ways of managing that.

53
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:13,829
You must be careful.

54
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:16,394
l'm deathly afraid of him,
of what he might do.

55
00:04:16,472 --> 00:04:19,236
She's so young, and his bringing her here
is a serious....

56
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:21,402
Mightn't he do something to her?

57
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:24,037
Just leave that to us.
We'll know how to handle him.

58
00:04:24,113 --> 00:04:26,479
But l want you to know
he's a dangerous man.

59
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:29,040
l honestly don't think
he'd stop at anything.

60
00:04:29,118 --> 00:04:32,713
l don't think he'd hesitate to kill Corinne
if it would save him.

61
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:34,916
Could he cover up by marrying her?

62
00:04:35,258 --> 00:04:37,783
He has a wife and three children
in England.

63
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,455
They usually do, though not always
in England. What does he look like?

64
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,364
He has dark hair
and thick, bushy eyebrows.

65
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:48,995
He talks in a loud, blustery manner.
He gives the impression of being violent.

66
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:52,838
He was wearing a light gray suit and
a gray hat when l saw him this morning.

67
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:54,342
What does he do?

68
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,934
l haven't the faintest idea.

69
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:58,503
-What time's he comin' to see you?
-After 8:00.

70
00:04:58,581 --> 00:05:01,379
All right, Miss Wonderly.
We'll have a man there.

71
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:03,609
l'll look after it myself.

72
00:05:04,253 --> 00:05:05,345
Thank you.

73
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,879
Oh, yes.

74
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:21,626
Will that be enough?

75
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,532
-Thank you.
-Not at all.

76
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,006
lt'll help some if you meet Thursby
in the lobby.

77
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:31,044
You don't have to look for me.
l'll see you all right.

78
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:32,206
Thank you.

79
00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:41,684
-Thank you so much.
-Good-bye.

80
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:47,686
They're right enough.

81
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:49,998
They have brothers in her bag.

82
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,932
-What do you think of her?
-She's sweet.

83
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,970
Maybe you saw her first, Sam,
but l spoke first.

84
00:05:58,174 --> 00:05:59,573
You've got brains.

85
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,433
Yes, you have.

86
00:06:29,872 --> 00:06:30,896
Hello.

87
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:34,265
Yeah. Speaking.

88
00:06:35,445 --> 00:06:36,969
Miles Archer dead?

89
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:39,371
Where?

90
00:06:41,117 --> 00:06:42,778
Bush and Stockton?

91
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:44,753
Yeah.

92
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,583
ln 15 minutes.

93
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,848
Thanks.

94
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:19,448
Hello, Effie?

95
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:21,150
lt's me.

96
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:23,516
Now, listen, precious.

97
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:25,216
Miles has been shot.

98
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:27,260
Yeah, dead.

99
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:30,525
Now, don't get excited.

100
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:32,301
Yeah.

101
00:07:34,103 --> 00:07:37,038
You'll have to break the news to lva.
l'd fry first.

102
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,703
And keep her away from me.

103
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,844
That's a good girl.

104
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:46,243
Now, get right over there.

105
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:49,041
You're an angel.

106
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:50,910
Good-bye.

107
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,199
-What do you want here?
-l'm Sam Spade. Tom Polhaus phoned.

108
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,966
l didn't know you at first.
They're back there.

109
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:36,920
Hello, Sam. l figured you'd want to see it
before we took him away.

110
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:38,489
Thanks, Tom. What happened?

111
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:40,934
Got him right through the pump with this.

112
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:42,265
lt's a Webley.

113
00:08:42,838 --> 00:08:44,237
English, ain't it?

114
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:48,599
A Webley-Forsby .45 automatic, 8-shot.
They don't make 'em anymore.

115
00:08:48,678 --> 00:08:50,942
-How many gone out of it?
-Just one.

116
00:08:51,214 --> 00:08:52,909
Let's see. Shot up here, huh?

117
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:55,246
Standing like you,
with his back to the fence.

118
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:57,343
The man who shot him stood here.

119
00:08:57,887 --> 00:09:02,017
Went backwards down the hill, takin'
the fence with him, got caught on the rock.

120
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:04,025
That's it. The blast burnt his coat.

121
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:06,118
-Who found him?
-Man on the beat.

122
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,429
-Anybody hear the shot?
-Somebody must've. We just got here.

123
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:13,126
You want to look at him
before we take him away?

124
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:15,261
No, you've seen everything l could.

125
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:17,602
His gun was still on his hip.
Hadn't been fired.

126
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:19,106
His overcoat was buttoned.

127
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:23,009
l found $100 bill in his vest pocket
and about $30 in his pants.

128
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:24,842
Was he workin', Sam?

129
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:26,971
Well?

130
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,779
-He was tailing a guy named Thursby.
-What for?

131
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,652
What for?

132
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:34,952
We wanted to find out where he lived.
Don't crowd me, Tom.

133
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:38,152
l'm goin' on down to break the news
to Miles' wife.

134
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:40,923
lt's tough, him gettin' it like that, ain't it?

135
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:45,329
Miles had his faults like any of us,
but he must've had some good points, too.

136
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,628
l guess so.

137
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:52,131
Miss Wonderly, please.

138
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:55,504
Checked out? What time?

139
00:09:58,447 --> 00:10:00,074
Any forwarding address?

140
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:01,872
Thanks.

141
00:10:36,952 --> 00:10:39,420
Hello, Tom. Hello, Lieutenant. Come in.

142
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:48,053
Sit down.

143
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,557
Sit down.

144
00:10:58,507 --> 00:10:59,496
Drink?

145
00:11:02,478 --> 00:11:05,174
You break the news to Miles' wife, Sam?

146
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:06,812
How'd she take it?

147
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:09,248
-l don't know anything about women.
-Since when?

148
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:10,808
What kind of gun do you carry?

149
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:13,514
None. l don't like 'em.
There are some at the office.

150
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,921
You don't have one here?
You sure about that?

151
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:20,189
Look around. Turn the dump upside down.
l won't squawk if you got a search warrant.

152
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,593
We don't want to make--

153
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:24,189
Why are you suckin' around here?
Tell me or get out!

154
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:27,565
You can't treat us like that. lt ain't right.
We got our work to do.

155
00:11:27,636 --> 00:11:29,194
Why were you tailin' Thursby?

156
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,535
l wasn't. Miles was
'cause we had a client--

157
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,405
-Who's the client?
-Sorry, l can't tell you that.

158
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:36,943
Be reasonable, Sam.
Give us a break, will you?

159
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:40,311
How can we turn up anything
if you don't tell us what you got?

160
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:44,376
Tom says you were in too much of a hurry
to even stop and look at your dead partner.

161
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,819
You didn't go to Archer's house
to tell his wife.

162
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:50,586
We called your office and the girl there
said you told her to do it.

163
00:11:50,693 --> 00:11:53,685
l'll give you ten minutes to get to a phone
and talk to her.

164
00:11:53,763 --> 00:11:56,323
l'll give you ten minutes
to get to Thursby's joint.

165
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,629
You could do it easily in that time.

166
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:00,362
What's your boyfriend gettin' at?

167
00:12:00,436 --> 00:12:03,428
Just this: Thursby was shot down
in front of his hotel...

168
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:05,667
...half an hour after you left Bush Street.

169
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:07,106
Keep your paws off me.

170
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:08,803
What time did you get home?

171
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:11,676
A few minutes ago.
l was walkin' and thinkin' things over.

172
00:12:11,747 --> 00:12:13,544
We know. We tried to call you.

173
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:15,140
-Where'd you walk?
-Bush Street.

174
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:17,685
-Did you see anybody--
-No. No witnesses.

175
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:20,278
Well, l know where l stand now.

176
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,820
Sorry l got up on my hind legs, but
you tryin' to rope me made me nervous.

177
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:27,886
Miles gettin' bumped off upset me,
then you birds crackin' foxy.

178
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:30,431
lt's all right now that l know
what it's all about.

179
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,693
Forget it, Sam.

180
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:33,166
-Thursby die?
-Yep.

181
00:12:33,235 --> 00:12:34,725
How'd l kill him? l forget.

182
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:39,400
He was shot in the back four times
with a .44 or .45 from across the street.

183
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:41,743
Nobody saw it, but that's how it figures.

184
00:12:41,811 --> 00:12:44,871
-Hotel people know anything?
-Just that he lived there a week.

185
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:46,437
-Alone?
-Yeah, alone.

186
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,973
Did you find out who he was?
What his game was? Well, did you?

187
00:12:50,252 --> 00:12:54,348
-We thought you could tell us that.
-l've never seen Thursby, dead or alive.

188
00:12:54,457 --> 00:12:55,754
You know me, Spade.

189
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:59,886
lf you did it, or if you didn't, you'll get
a square deal and most of the breaks.

190
00:12:59,962 --> 00:13:03,227
Don't know if l'd blame you much,
a man that killed your partner...

191
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:05,824
...but that won't stop me from nailin' you.

192
00:13:05,935 --> 00:13:06,924
Fair enough.

193
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:10,267
But l'd feel better about it
if you'd have a drink with me.

194
00:13:18,314 --> 00:13:19,838
Success to crime!

195
00:13:40,469 --> 00:13:41,959
She's in there.

196
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:46,505
-l told you to keep her away from me.
-Yes, but you didn't tell me how.

197
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:49,300
Don't be cranky with me.
l've had her all night.

198
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:51,403
Sorry, angel. l didn't mean--

199
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:53,341
Hello, lva.

200
00:14:01,023 --> 00:14:02,149
Sam!

201
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:06,350
Darling.

202
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:08,830
Effie take care of everything?

203
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:10,190
l think so.

204
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:14,029
Sam, did you kill him?

205
00:14:16,472 --> 00:14:18,770
Who put that bright idea in your head?

206
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:22,806
Well, l thought you said
if it wasn't for Miles, you'd....

207
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:25,674
Be kind to me, Sam.

208
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,921
''You killed my husband, Sam.
Be kind to me! ''

209
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,771
Don't, lva, don't.

210
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:53,866
You shouldn't have come here today,
darling. You ought to be home.

211
00:14:53,943 --> 00:14:55,376
You'll come soon?

212
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:57,044
Soon as l can.

213
00:14:57,513 --> 00:14:58,946
Good-bye, lva.

214
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:21,191
Well...

215
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,100
...how did you and the widow make out?

216
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,868
She thinks l shot Miles.

217
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,875
-So you could marry her?
-The cops think l killed Thursby...

218
00:15:28,944 --> 00:15:31,469
...the guy Miles was tailing
for that Wonderly dame.

219
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:33,014
Who do you think l shot?

220
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:34,549
Are you going to marry lva?

221
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:37,450
Don't be silly.
l wish l'd never laid eyes on her.

222
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:41,089
Do you suppose she could have killed him?

223
00:15:41,757 --> 00:15:44,783
You're an angel.
A nice, rattle-brained, little angel.

224
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,589
-Oh, am l?
-Thanks, honey.

225
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:49,693
Suppose l told you that your lva
hadn't been home long...

226
00:15:49,765 --> 00:15:52,757
...when l arrived to break the news
at 3:00 this morning?

227
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:53,995
Are you telling me?

228
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:56,435
She kept me waiting at the door
as she undressed.

229
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:59,406
Her clothes were on a chair
where she'd dumped them.

230
00:15:59,475 --> 00:16:01,500
Her slip, on top, was still warm.

231
00:16:01,577 --> 00:16:04,137
She'd wrinkled up the bed,
but they weren't mashed down.

232
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,080
You're a detective, darling,
but she didn't kill him.

233
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:09,947
Do the police really think
you shot this what's-his-name?

234
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:10,986
Do they?

235
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,418
Look at me, Sam.

236
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:14,016
You worry me.

237
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:18,554
You think you know what you're doing,
but you're too slick for your own good.

238
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:22,187
Someday you're going to find it out.
Spade and Archer.

239
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:24,258
Yes, Miss Wonderly.

240
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:27,059
Hello.

241
00:16:27,302 --> 00:16:28,997
Yeah, this is Sam Spade.

242
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,628
Where?

243
00:16:31,874 --> 00:16:35,640
Coronet Apartments, California Avenue,
Apartment 1001 .

244
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:37,740
What's the name?

245
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:39,212
Miss LeBlanc.

246
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,477
Okay, l'll be right over.

247
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:48,455
Have Miles' desk moved out of the office...

248
00:16:48,524 --> 00:16:52,085
...and have ''Spade and Archer'' taken off
all the doors and windows, and...

249
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:53,958
...have ''Samuel Spade'' put on.

250
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,677
Come in, Mr. Spade.

251
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:16,612
Everything's upside down.
l haven't finished unpacking. Sit down.

252
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:25,323
Mr. Spade, l...

253
00:17:26,428 --> 00:17:29,261
...l have a terrible,
terrible confession to make.

254
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:32,659
That story l told you yesterday...

255
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:34,692
...was just a story.

256
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:38,228
Oh, that. Well, we didn't exactly
believe your story, Miss....

257
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:40,904
What is your name, Wonderly or LeBlanc?

258
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,137
lt's O'Shaughnessy. Brigid O'Shaughnessy.

259
00:17:43,212 --> 00:17:45,703
We didn't exactly believe your story.

260
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:47,373
We believed your $200.

261
00:17:47,449 --> 00:17:48,313
You mean--

262
00:17:48,383 --> 00:17:50,783
You paid us more
than if you'd told the truth...

263
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:53,083
...and enough more to make it all right.

264
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,215
Tell me, Mr. Spade,
am l to blame for last night?

265
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,751
You warned us that Thursby
was dangerous.

266
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:02,627
You lied to us about your sister
and all that, but we didn't believe you.

267
00:18:02,698 --> 00:18:05,166
No, l wouldn't say that you were at fault.

268
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:06,462
Thank you.

269
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:09,130
Mr. Archer was so alive yesterday...

270
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:11,604
-...so solid and hearty, and--
-Stop it.

271
00:18:11,774 --> 00:18:14,868
He knew what he was doing.
Those are the chances we take.

272
00:18:14,943 --> 00:18:16,001
Was he married?

273
00:18:16,078 --> 00:18:19,946
Yeah, with $10,000 insurance, no children,
and a wife that didn't like him.

274
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,506
-Please don't.
-That's the way it was.

275
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:25,485
Anyway, there's no time for worrying
about that now.

276
00:18:25,554 --> 00:18:28,785
Out there's a flock of policemen
and assistant DAs...

277
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,655
...running around with their noses
to the ground.

278
00:18:32,494 --> 00:18:34,894
Mr. Spade, do they know about me?

279
00:18:35,063 --> 00:18:37,793
Not yet. l've been stalling 'em
until l could see you.

280
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,094
Do they have to know?

281
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:42,194
Can't you shield me so l won't have
to answer their questions?

282
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:44,796
Maybe, but l gotta know
what it's all about.

283
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:47,173
l can't tell you.

284
00:18:48,343 --> 00:18:49,867
l can't tell you now.

285
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,776
l will later, when l can.

286
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:56,143
You've got to trust me, Mr. Spade.

287
00:18:56,985 --> 00:18:58,953
l'm so alone and afraid.

288
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:02,987
l've got nobody to help me
if you won't help me.

289
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:05,219
Be generous, Mr. Spade.

290
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:07,527
You're brave. You're strong.

291
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:10,664
You can spare me some
of that courage and strength, surely.

292
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,098
Help me, Mr. Spade. l need help so badly.

293
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:16,535
l've no right to ask you, l know l haven't,
but l do ask you.

294
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:17,594
Help me.

295
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:21,474
You won't need much of anybody's help.
You're good.

296
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,875
lt's chiefly your eyes,
and that throb you got in your voice...

297
00:19:24,947 --> 00:19:28,041
...when you say things like,
''Be generous, Mr. Spade.''

298
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,640
l deserve that.

299
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:34,211
But the lie was in the way l said it,
not at all in what l said.

300
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:39,087
lt's my own fault
if you can't believe me now.

301
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,662
Now, you are dangerous.

302
00:19:43,298 --> 00:19:45,960
l'm afraid l won't be able
to be of much help to you...

303
00:19:46,034 --> 00:19:48,025
...without some idea of what it's about.

304
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:52,039
For instance, l've gotta have some sort
of a line on your Floyd Thursby.

305
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,031
l met him in the Orient.

306
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,771
We came from Hong Kong last week.
He promised to help me.

307
00:19:56,845 --> 00:19:59,370
He took advantage of my dependence
on him to betray me.

308
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,474
Betray you? How?
Why did you want him shadowed?

309
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,610
To find out how far he'd gone,
whom he'd met, things like that.

310
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:08,815
-Did he kill Archer?
-Certainly.

311
00:20:09,224 --> 00:20:13,160
He had a Luger in his shoulder holster.
Archer wasn't shot with a Luger.

312
00:20:14,396 --> 00:20:18,730
Mr. Spade, you don't think l had anything
to do with the death of Mr. Archer?

313
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:20,195
-Did you?
-No.

314
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:21,563
That's good.

315
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:24,604
Floyd always carried an extra revolver
in his coat pocket.

316
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:26,300
Why all the guns?

317
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,942
He lived by them.

318
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,410
The story is that he first came
to the Orient...

319
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,312
...as bodyguard to a gambler
who'd had to leave the States.

320
00:20:33,382 --> 00:20:37,375
The gambler had since disappeared
and Floyd knew about it. l don't know.

321
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:41,013
l do know he always went heavily armed,
and that he never went to sleep...

322
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:44,286
...without covering the floor around his bed
with newspapers...

323
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:46,884
...so that nobody could come silently
into his room.

324
00:20:46,962 --> 00:20:48,793
You picked a nice sort of playmate.

325
00:20:48,864 --> 00:20:51,924
Only that sort could have helped me,
if he'd been loyal.

326
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,831
How bad a spot are you actually in?

327
00:20:53,902 --> 00:20:54,960
Bad as could be.

328
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:56,299
Physical danger?

329
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:59,932
l'm not heroic. l don't think
there's anything worse than death.

330
00:21:00,075 --> 00:21:03,602
-Then, it's that?
-lt's that, as surely as we're sitting here.

331
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,647
Unless you help me.

332
00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:10,217
Who killed Thursby, your enemies or his?

333
00:21:10,986 --> 00:21:12,214
l don't know.

334
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,985
His, l suppose.

335
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:16,524
l'm afraid...l don't know.

336
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,217
This is hopeless!
l don't know what you want done...

337
00:21:19,294 --> 00:21:20,921
...or if you know what you want.

338
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:22,122
You won't go to the police?

339
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,893
l just got to stand still,
and they'll swarm all over me.

340
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:27,902
l'll tell 'em all l know,
and you must take your chances.

341
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,404
You've been patient with me
and tried to help me.

342
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:32,406
lt's useless and hopeless, l suppose.

343
00:21:32,474 --> 00:21:36,433
l do thank you for what you've done.
l'll have to take my chances.

344
00:21:40,315 --> 00:21:41,976
How much money have you got?

345
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,813
l've got about $500 left.

346
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,147
Give it to me.

347
00:22:04,206 --> 00:22:06,970
-There's only $400 here.
-l had to keep some to live on.

348
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:08,600
-Can't you get some more?
-No.

349
00:22:08,677 --> 00:22:10,736
You got anything you can raise money on?

350
00:22:10,812 --> 00:22:14,475
-l've got some furs and a little jewelry.
-You'll have to hock 'em.

351
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,815
There you are.

352
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:25,223
l'll be back soon with the best news
l can manage.

353
00:22:25,293 --> 00:22:27,955
l'll ring four times: long, short, long, short.

354
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,466
You needn't bother to come to the door.
l'll let myself in.

355
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:41,941
Anything stirring?

356
00:22:42,077 --> 00:22:43,510
Did you send the flowers?

357
00:22:43,578 --> 00:22:47,014
You're invaluable, darling.
Say, get my lawyer on the phone, will you?

358
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,090
Hello, Sid?

359
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:08,394
l think l'm going to have to tell a coroner
to go to blazes, Sid.

360
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:12,169
Can l hide behind the sanctity
of my client's identity...

361
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,334
...secrets and what-nots all the same,
priest or lawyer?

362
00:23:15,877 --> 00:23:20,007
But Dundy's getting a little rambunctious,
and maybe it is a bit thick this time.

363
00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:22,915
What'll it cost to be on the safe side?

364
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,212
Maybe it's worth it.

365
00:23:24,286 --> 00:23:25,583
Okay, go ahead.

366
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,320
Gardenia.

367
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:35,226
Quick, darling, in with him!

368
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,130
Will you come in, Mr. Cairo?

369
00:23:46,108 --> 00:23:48,008
Will you sit down, Mr. Cairo?

370
00:23:48,276 --> 00:23:49,573
Thank you, sir.

371
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:55,175
Now, what can l do for you, Mr. Cairo?

372
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,311
May a stranger offer condolences
for your partner's unfortunate death?

373
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:00,977
Thanks.

374
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:03,080
ls there, as the newspapers imply...

375
00:24:03,158 --> 00:24:07,151
...a certain relationship between
that unfortunate happening and...

376
00:24:07,896 --> 00:24:10,592
...the death a little later
of the man Thursby?

377
00:24:12,634 --> 00:24:14,499
l beg your pardon. No.

378
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,598
More than idle curiosity prompted
my question.

379
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:20,664
See, Mr. Spade, l'm trying to recover...

380
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:24,377
...an ornament that, shall we say,
has been mislaid.

381
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:27,842
l thought and hoped you could assist me.

382
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:29,850
The ornament is a statuette...

383
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:32,514
...a black figure of a bird.

384
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,856
l am prepared to pay, on behalf of...

385
00:24:34,923 --> 00:24:38,825
...the figure's rightful owner,
the sum of $5,000 for its recovery.

386
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,993
l am prepared to promise that,
what is the phrase...

387
00:24:43,832 --> 00:24:45,663
...''No questions will be asked.''

388
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,725
$5,000 is a lot of money.

389
00:24:51,773 --> 00:24:52,865
Yes, Effie?

390
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:57,337
No, that'll be all. Just be sure
to lock the door on your way out.

391
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,538
Good night.

392
00:24:59,781 --> 00:25:00,770
$5,000 is--

393
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:04,148
You will clasp your hands together
at the back of your neck.

394
00:25:04,653 --> 00:25:07,178
l intend to search your offices, Mr. Spade.

395
00:25:08,056 --> 00:25:11,924
l warn you, if you attempt to prevent me,
l shall certainly shoot you.

396
00:25:12,661 --> 00:25:14,128
Go ahead and search.

397
00:25:14,196 --> 00:25:16,858
Please come to the center of the room.

398
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:22,062
l have to make certain
that you are not armed.

399
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,621
Look what you did to my shirt!

400
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:51,818
Sorry.

401
00:26:51,893 --> 00:26:55,090
But imagine my embarrassment
when l found out that $5,000 offer...

402
00:26:55,163 --> 00:26:56,255
...was just hooey.

403
00:26:56,331 --> 00:26:58,492
Mr. Spade, my offer is genuine.

404
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:02,300
l am prepared to pay $5,000
for the figure's return.

405
00:27:03,672 --> 00:27:05,264
-You have it?
-No.

406
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,769
lf it isn't here...

407
00:27:07,842 --> 00:27:10,902
...why did you risk serious injury
to prevent my searching?

408
00:27:10,979 --> 00:27:14,073
Why should l sit here
and let people come in and stick me up?

409
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:17,414
Certainly it is only natural
that l try to save the owner...

410
00:27:17,485 --> 00:27:19,646
...such a considerable expense if possible.

411
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:20,813
Who is he?

412
00:27:20,989 --> 00:27:24,550
Mr. Spade, you'll forgive
my not answering that question.

413
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:28,254
l think we'd be better off all around
if we'd put our cards on the table.

414
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,662
No, l do not think it would be better.

415
00:27:31,366 --> 00:27:35,928
You see, if you know more than l do,
then l shall profit by your knowledge.

416
00:27:36,271 --> 00:27:38,865
So will you, to the extent of $5,000.

417
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,504
There's nothing like $5,000 here.

418
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:44,305
You want some assurance of my sincerity?

419
00:27:44,612 --> 00:27:46,842
-A retainer? Would that do?
-lt might.

420
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,906
You will take, say, $100?

421
00:27:49,117 --> 00:27:51,176
No. l will take, say, $200.

422
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:55,545
Your first guess was that l had the bird.
There's nothing to that.

423
00:27:55,623 --> 00:27:57,056
What's your second guess?

424
00:27:57,125 --> 00:28:01,221
That you know where it is, or at least
you know it is where you can get it.

425
00:28:01,296 --> 00:28:03,821
You're not hiring me to do murders
or burglaries...

426
00:28:03,898 --> 00:28:07,231
...but simply to get it back if possible,
in an honest, lawful way?

427
00:28:07,302 --> 00:28:08,792
lf possible. But...

428
00:28:09,504 --> 00:28:11,529
...in any case, with discretion.

429
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:17,475
When you wish to contact me, sir,
l'm staying at the Hotel Belvedere...

430
00:28:17,645 --> 00:28:19,545
...Room 635.

431
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:23,908
l sincerely expect
the greatest mutual benefit...

432
00:28:24,152 --> 00:28:26,518
...from our association, Mr. Spade.

433
00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:29,220
May l please have my gun now?

434
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,588
Oh, sure. l'd forgotten all about it.

435
00:28:33,862 --> 00:28:37,059
You will please clasp your hands together
at the back of your neck.

436
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,225
l intend to search your offices.

437
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:40,732
Well, l'll be....

438
00:28:44,105 --> 00:28:45,231
Why, sure.

439
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,502
Go ahead. l won't stop you.

440
00:29:34,918 --> 00:29:37,648
-Turn right and go up the hill, driver.
-Okay.

441
00:30:18,128 --> 00:30:19,220
Mr. Spade!

442
00:30:20,998 --> 00:30:22,727
Do you bring me any news?

443
00:30:22,866 --> 00:30:25,926
Did you manage it so the police
won't have to know about me?

444
00:30:26,003 --> 00:30:27,732
They won't for a while, anyway.

445
00:30:27,805 --> 00:30:29,397
You are wonderful!

446
00:30:30,074 --> 00:30:31,632
You won't get into trouble?

447
00:30:31,709 --> 00:30:34,234
l don't mind a reasonable amount
of trouble.

448
00:30:36,814 --> 00:30:38,145
Do sit down.

449
00:30:50,794 --> 00:30:54,457
You aren't exactly the sort of a person
you pretend to be, are you?

450
00:30:55,332 --> 00:30:58,267
Why, l'm not sure l know exactly
what you mean.

451
00:30:58,369 --> 00:31:02,066
The schoolgirl manner. You know,
blushing, stammering and all that.

452
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:07,302
l haven't lived a good life. l've been bad.

453
00:31:09,113 --> 00:31:10,603
Worse than you could know.

454
00:31:10,681 --> 00:31:14,242
Good, because if you actually were
as innocent as you pretend to be...

455
00:31:14,318 --> 00:31:15,785
...we'd never get anywhere.

456
00:31:15,853 --> 00:31:17,184
l won't be innocent.

457
00:31:17,254 --> 00:31:18,243
Good.

458
00:31:19,923 --> 00:31:22,187
By the way, l saw Joel Cairo tonight.

459
00:31:23,894 --> 00:31:24,986
Do you know him?

460
00:31:25,062 --> 00:31:26,324
Only slightly.

461
00:31:51,522 --> 00:31:53,513
You're good. You're very good.

462
00:31:53,991 --> 00:31:55,549
-What did he say?
-About what?

463
00:31:55,626 --> 00:31:57,355
-About me.
-Nothing.

464
00:31:57,761 --> 00:32:01,788
-What did you talk about then?
-He offered me $5,000 for the black bird.

465
00:32:05,235 --> 00:32:09,695
You won't go around straightening things
and poking the fire again, will you?

466
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,000
No, l'm not.

467
00:32:11,942 --> 00:32:15,002
-What did you say?
-l said $5,000 was a lot of money.

468
00:32:15,379 --> 00:32:16,368
lt is.

469
00:32:17,014 --> 00:32:20,848
lt's more than l can ever offer you
if l have to bid for your loyalty.

470
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,788
That's good coming from you.

471
00:32:25,589 --> 00:32:28,114
What have you ever given me
besides money?

472
00:32:28,192 --> 00:32:31,252
Have you ever given me
any of your confidence, any truth?

473
00:32:31,328 --> 00:32:33,819
Haven't you tried to buy my loyalty
with only money?

474
00:32:33,897 --> 00:32:36,195
What else is there l can buy you with?

475
00:32:52,916 --> 00:32:55,111
l don't care what your secrets are.

476
00:32:56,019 --> 00:32:59,682
But l can't go ahead without
more confidence in you than l've got now.

477
00:32:59,756 --> 00:33:02,657
You've got to convince me
you aren't just fiddling around...

478
00:33:02,726 --> 00:33:05,058
...hoping it'll all come out right in the end.

479
00:33:05,128 --> 00:33:06,254
Trust me a little longer?

480
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,730
How much is a little?
What are you waiting for?

481
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,460
l've got to talk to Joel Cairo.

482
00:33:10,534 --> 00:33:13,901
You can see him tonight.
He's at the theater. lt'll be out soon.

483
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:16,997
-l'll leave a message at his hotel.
-But he can't come here.

484
00:33:17,074 --> 00:33:19,167
l'm afraid to let him know where l am.

485
00:33:19,243 --> 00:33:20,505
My place, then.

486
00:33:21,712 --> 00:33:22,701
Hello?

487
00:33:22,913 --> 00:33:25,381
l want to leave a message for Joel Cairo.

488
00:33:47,838 --> 00:33:50,238
l never would've placed myself
in this position...

489
00:33:50,307 --> 00:33:52,172
...if l didn't trust you completely.

490
00:33:52,242 --> 00:33:53,334
That again?

491
00:33:56,713 --> 00:33:58,613
You know that's true, though.

492
00:33:59,082 --> 00:34:02,950
You don't have to trust me as long
as you can persuade me to trust you.

493
00:34:04,288 --> 00:34:06,279
But don't worry about that now.

494
00:34:06,557 --> 00:34:08,286
He'll be along any minute.

495
00:34:08,892 --> 00:34:12,453
You get your business with Cairo over with
and then we'll see how we stand.

496
00:34:12,529 --> 00:34:14,463
You'll let me go about it with him...

497
00:34:14,531 --> 00:34:15,657
...in my own way?

498
00:34:15,732 --> 00:34:16,824
Sure.

499
00:34:19,736 --> 00:34:21,397
You are a godsend.

500
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,936
Now, don't overdo it.

501
00:34:32,182 --> 00:34:36,016
Mr. Spade! There is a boy outside.
He seems to be watching the house.

502
00:34:36,086 --> 00:34:37,417
l know. l spotted him.

503
00:34:37,487 --> 00:34:39,478
What? What's that? What boy?

504
00:34:39,556 --> 00:34:42,116
A kid. He's been trailing me all evening.

505
00:34:42,192 --> 00:34:45,286
-Did he follow you to my apartment?
-l shook him before that.

506
00:34:45,362 --> 00:34:47,091
Come in, Mr. Cairo.

507
00:34:51,868 --> 00:34:55,964
-l'm delighted to see you again, madam.
-l was sure you would be, Joel.

508
00:35:00,143 --> 00:35:03,169
Mr. Spade told me about your offer
for the falcon.

509
00:35:03,313 --> 00:35:05,508
-When will the money be ready?
-lt is ready.

510
00:35:05,582 --> 00:35:06,844
-ln cash?
-Yes.

511
00:35:06,917 --> 00:35:09,886
You're ready to pay $5,000
if we turn over the falcon to you?

512
00:35:09,953 --> 00:35:12,854
Excuse me, please.
l must have expressed myself badly.

513
00:35:12,923 --> 00:35:15,517
l did not mean that l have the money
in my pocket...

514
00:35:15,592 --> 00:35:18,618
...but l am ready to get it for you
on a few minutes' notice...

515
00:35:18,695 --> 00:35:20,458
...anytime during banking hours.

516
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:23,158
That's probably true.
He only had a couple hundred...

517
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:25,793
...when l searched him this afternoon
at my office.

518
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:30,568
l shall be able to have the money for you
at, say, 10:30 in the morning.

519
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:33,608
But l haven't got the falcon.

520
00:35:35,379 --> 00:35:38,177
l'll have it in another week
at the most, though.

521
00:35:38,281 --> 00:35:39,646
Then, where is it?

522
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,315
Where Floyd hid it.

523
00:35:41,385 --> 00:35:42,352
Floyd?

524
00:35:43,286 --> 00:35:46,346
You know where he hid it?
Then why do we have to wait a week?

525
00:35:46,423 --> 00:35:47,913
Perhaps not a whole week.

526
00:35:47,991 --> 00:35:51,984
And why, if l may ask another question,
are you willing to sell it to me?

527
00:35:52,763 --> 00:35:54,526
Because l'm afraid.

528
00:35:54,965 --> 00:35:58,628
After Floyd, l'm afraid to touch it
except to turn it over to somebody else.

529
00:35:58,702 --> 00:36:00,761
What exactly did happen to Floyd?

530
00:36:03,473 --> 00:36:04,599
The fat man.

531
00:36:05,242 --> 00:36:07,642
The fat man? ls he here?

532
00:36:08,078 --> 00:36:09,875
l don't know. l suppose so.

533
00:36:10,147 --> 00:36:11,739
What difference does it make?

534
00:36:11,815 --> 00:36:13,976
lt might make a world of difference.

535
00:36:15,152 --> 00:36:16,244
Or you or me.

536
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:19,413
Precisely. But, shall we add,
more certainly...

537
00:36:20,724 --> 00:36:22,021
...the boy outside?

538
00:36:22,092 --> 00:36:25,528
Yes. But you might be able
to get around him, Joel...

539
00:36:25,595 --> 00:36:27,529
...as you did the one in lstanbul.

540
00:36:27,597 --> 00:36:29,258
What was his name?

541
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,227
You mean the one you couldn't get
to come to--

542
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,700
This is the second time
that you have laid hands on me!

543
00:36:39,976 --> 00:36:42,672
When you're slapped
you'll take it and like it.

544
00:36:45,148 --> 00:36:46,410
Who's that?

545
00:36:46,683 --> 00:36:48,310
l don't know. Keep quiet.

546
00:36:56,493 --> 00:36:57,482
Hello.

547
00:36:58,361 --> 00:37:00,921
You guys pick swell hours
to do your visiting in.

548
00:37:00,997 --> 00:37:03,261
-What now?
-We want to talk to you.

549
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:06,200
-Go ahead and talk.
-Do we have to do it out in the hall?

550
00:37:06,269 --> 00:37:09,067
-You can't come in.
-Come off it now, Sam.

551
00:37:09,706 --> 00:37:11,867
You aren't tryin' to strongarm me, are you?

552
00:37:11,942 --> 00:37:13,432
Why don't you be reasonable?

553
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,603
lt would pay you to play along with us.

554
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:18,842
You got away with this and that,
but you can't keep it up forever.

555
00:37:18,915 --> 00:37:21,816
-Stop me when you can.
-That's what l intend to do.

556
00:37:21,985 --> 00:37:24,351
There's talk about you and Archer's wife.

557
00:37:24,421 --> 00:37:26,582
-ls there anything to it?
-Not a thing.

558
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,523
She tried to get a divorce from him
to put in with you...

559
00:37:29,593 --> 00:37:32,323
...but he wouldn't give it to her.
Anything to that?

560
00:37:32,395 --> 00:37:34,363
Talk is that's why he was put on the spot.

561
00:37:34,431 --> 00:37:36,160
Don't be a hog, Dundy.

562
00:37:36,233 --> 00:37:38,963
Your idea that l killed Thursby
because he killed Miles...

563
00:37:39,035 --> 00:37:41,401
...falls to pieces if l'm blamed
for killing Miles.

564
00:37:41,471 --> 00:37:43,530
You haven't heard me say
you killed anybody.

565
00:37:43,607 --> 00:37:44,972
You keep bringing that up.

566
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:47,703
Haven't you anything better to do
than to pop in here...

567
00:37:47,778 --> 00:37:50,178
...early every morning asking
fool questions?

568
00:37:50,247 --> 00:37:53,114
-And gettin' a lot of lyin' answers.
-Take it easy.

569
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:57,150
lf you say there's nothin' between you
and Archer's wife, you're a liar.

570
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,656
ls that the hot tip that brought you up here
at this ungodly hour?

571
00:38:00,724 --> 00:38:02,055
That's one of 'em.

572
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:03,558
And the other?

573
00:38:04,127 --> 00:38:05,219
Let us in!

574
00:38:07,264 --> 00:38:09,061
All right, Spade, we'll go.

575
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:12,563
Maybe you're right in buckin' us.
Think it over.

576
00:38:15,338 --> 00:38:16,430
Help!

577
00:38:16,873 --> 00:38:19,341
-l guess we're goin' in.
-l guess you are.

578
00:38:22,345 --> 00:38:23,812
What's goin' on in here?

579
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,348
Look, Officer! Look what she did!

580
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:29,117
-Did you do that?
-l had to.

581
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:31,244
l was alone with him.
He tried to attack me.

582
00:38:31,321 --> 00:38:33,221
l had to keep him off. l couldn't shoot him!

583
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:36,282
You dirty, filthy liar! lt isn't true!

584
00:38:36,459 --> 00:38:39,428
l came up here in good faith,
then both of them attacked me.

585
00:38:39,496 --> 00:38:43,023
Then when he went out to talk to you
he left her here with a pistol.

586
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:45,465
She said as soon as you leave
they'll kill me...

587
00:38:45,535 --> 00:38:48,902
...so l called for help. l didn't want you
to leave me to be murdered.

588
00:38:48,972 --> 00:38:51,167
And then she struck me with the pistol!

589
00:38:51,241 --> 00:38:53,539
Why don't you make him tell the truth?

590
00:38:54,377 --> 00:38:55,605
Wait a minute!

591
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:57,112
That's no way to act!

592
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,842
l don't guess we'll be wrong
runnin' the lot of 'em in.

593
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:02,441
Don't be in a hurry.
Everything can be explained.

594
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:03,486
l'll bet.

595
00:39:03,553 --> 00:39:07,649
Miss O'Shaughnessy, Lieutenant Dundy
and Detective Sergeant Polhaus.

596
00:39:07,724 --> 00:39:11,524
Miss O'Shaughnessy is an operative
in my employ since yesterday.

597
00:39:11,595 --> 00:39:12,721
That's a lie, too!

598
00:39:12,796 --> 00:39:14,423
That is Mr. Joel Cairo.

599
00:39:14,798 --> 00:39:18,734
Cairo was an acquaintance of Thursby's.
He came to my office late this afternoon...

600
00:39:18,802 --> 00:39:22,795
...and hired me to find something Thursby
had on him when he was bumped off.

601
00:39:22,873 --> 00:39:26,206
lt looked funny to me the way he put it,
so l wouldn't touch it.

602
00:39:26,276 --> 00:39:29,302
Then he pulled a gun on me.
That's neither here nor there...

603
00:39:29,379 --> 00:39:32,542
...unless we start preferring charges
against each other.

604
00:39:33,683 --> 00:39:37,141
Miss O'Shaughnessy and l discussed
the matter and decided to find out...

605
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,451
...exactly how much he knew
about Miles' and Thursby's killings...

606
00:39:40,523 --> 00:39:42,252
...so we asked him to come here.

607
00:39:42,325 --> 00:39:45,761
Now, maybe we did put the questions
to him a little roughly....

608
00:39:46,162 --> 00:39:48,062
You know how that is, Lieutenant?

609
00:39:48,131 --> 00:39:50,964
But we didn't hurt him enough
to make him cry for help.

610
00:39:51,034 --> 00:39:54,026
-What have you got to say to that?
-l don't know what to say.

611
00:39:54,104 --> 00:39:55,503
Try tellin' the facts.

612
00:39:55,572 --> 00:39:57,540
-What? Facts?
-Quit stallin'.

613
00:39:57,607 --> 00:40:01,668
Just swear out a complaint they took
a poke at you and l'll throw 'em in the can.

614
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:03,838
Go ahead, Cairo. Tell him you'll do it.

615
00:40:03,914 --> 00:40:07,782
Then we'll swear out a complaint
against you and he'll have the lot of us.

616
00:40:07,851 --> 00:40:09,284
Get your hats.

617
00:40:09,653 --> 00:40:12,622
Well, boys and girls, we put it over nicely!

618
00:40:12,856 --> 00:40:14,153
Go on, get your hats!

619
00:40:14,224 --> 00:40:16,021
Don't you know when you're bein' kidded?

620
00:40:16,092 --> 00:40:18,458
No, but that can wait
till we get down to the Hall.

621
00:40:18,528 --> 00:40:20,996
Wake up, Dundy, you're being kidded!

622
00:40:21,097 --> 00:40:23,759
When l heard the buzzer, l said:

623
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:27,132
''There's the police again.
They're getting to be a nuisance!

624
00:40:27,203 --> 00:40:28,636
''When you hear them, scream.

625
00:40:28,705 --> 00:40:31,572
''Then we'll see how far we can string 'em
till they tumble.''

626
00:40:31,641 --> 00:40:33,040
Stop it, Sam!

627
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:35,537
How'd that cut on his head get there?

628
00:40:35,612 --> 00:40:38,672
-Ask him. Maybe he cut himself shaving.
-The cut? No.

629
00:40:38,748 --> 00:40:43,082
When we pretended to be struggling
for the gun, l fell over the carpet. l fell.

630
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:44,345
Horse feathers!

631
00:40:44,421 --> 00:40:47,720
-Take him along, anyway, for packin' a gun.
-Don't be a sap.

632
00:40:48,024 --> 00:40:49,855
That gun was a plant, it's one of mine.

633
00:40:49,926 --> 00:40:52,918
Too bad it's only a .25,
or you could prove it was the gun...

634
00:40:52,996 --> 00:40:55,464
...that Miles and Thursby were shot with.

635
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:58,658
-No, Sam! No!
-Then get him out of here!

636
00:40:58,735 --> 00:41:02,671
-Get their names and addresses.
-My name is Joel Cairo, Hotel Belvedere.

637
00:41:02,772 --> 00:41:04,467
Miss O'Shaughnessy's address is my office.

638
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:06,406
-Where do you live?
-Get him out!

639
00:41:06,476 --> 00:41:09,138
Take it easy!
ls that all you want, Lieutenant?

640
00:41:09,212 --> 00:41:10,679
l think l'll be going now.

641
00:41:10,747 --> 00:41:12,146
What's the hurry, Cairo?

642
00:41:12,215 --> 00:41:15,082
There is no hurry.
lt's getting quite late, and....

643
00:41:16,853 --> 00:41:18,582
Tell him to leave the gun.

644
00:41:22,192 --> 00:41:24,888
l hope you know what you're doin', Sam.

645
00:41:34,804 --> 00:41:38,797
You're absolutely the wildest,
most unpredictable person l ever knew.

646
00:41:39,009 --> 00:41:41,307
Do you always carry on so highhanded?

647
00:41:43,313 --> 00:41:45,611
Well, you've had your talk with Cairo.

648
00:41:46,049 --> 00:41:47,744
Now you can talk to me.

649
00:41:48,485 --> 00:41:50,009
Yes, of course.

650
00:41:50,253 --> 00:41:51,515
l'm listening.

651
00:41:53,023 --> 00:41:54,513
l'm still listening.

652
00:41:54,591 --> 00:41:58,925
-Look at the time! l must be going.
-No. Not till you've told me all about it.

653
00:41:59,095 --> 00:42:00,619
Am l a prisoner?

654
00:42:01,131 --> 00:42:03,622
Maybe the boy outside
hasn't gone home yet.

655
00:42:05,335 --> 00:42:07,269
Do you suppose he's still there?

656
00:42:07,337 --> 00:42:08,326
Likely.

657
00:42:09,672 --> 00:42:11,162
You can start now.

658
00:42:15,879 --> 00:42:18,313
You are the most insistent person.

659
00:42:18,915 --> 00:42:20,940
And wild and unpredictable, huh?

660
00:42:21,785 --> 00:42:25,619
Say, what's this bird, this falcon,
that everybody's all steamed up about?

661
00:42:25,688 --> 00:42:28,179
Supposing l wouldn't tell you
anything about it?

662
00:42:28,258 --> 00:42:31,386
Would you do something wild
and unpredictable?

663
00:42:31,861 --> 00:42:32,987
l might.

664
00:42:35,398 --> 00:42:37,958
lt's a black figure, as you know,
smooth and shiny...

665
00:42:38,034 --> 00:42:40,764
...of a bird, a hawk or falcon,
about that high.

666
00:42:41,071 --> 00:42:42,129
Here.

667
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:48,170
-What makes it so important?
-l don't know. They wouldn't tell me.

668
00:42:48,244 --> 00:42:52,180
They offered me L500 if l'd help
get it away from the man who had it.

669
00:42:52,248 --> 00:42:53,806
That was in lstanbul?

670
00:42:54,017 --> 00:42:55,075
Marmora.

671
00:42:56,019 --> 00:42:57,179
Go ahead.

672
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,617
But that's all.

673
00:42:59,389 --> 00:43:02,517
They promised me L500
if l'd help them, and l did.

674
00:43:03,293 --> 00:43:06,319
Then we found out that Joel Cairo
intended to desert us...

675
00:43:06,396 --> 00:43:09,524
...taking the falcon with him
and leaving Floyd and me nothing...

676
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,692
...so we did exactly that to him.

677
00:43:12,202 --> 00:43:14,466
But, l wasn't any better off than before.

678
00:43:14,537 --> 00:43:16,937
Floyd had no intention
of keeping his promise...

679
00:43:17,006 --> 00:43:20,134
...about sharing equally.
l'd learned that when we got here.

680
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:21,905
What's the bird made of?

681
00:43:22,011 --> 00:43:25,742
Porcelain or black stone. l don't know.
l only saw it once for a few minutes.

682
00:43:25,815 --> 00:43:28,545
Floyd showed it to me
when we first got hold of it.

683
00:43:28,618 --> 00:43:30,108
You are a liar!

684
00:43:33,323 --> 00:43:34,415
l am.

685
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:37,053
l've always been a liar.

686
00:43:37,861 --> 00:43:39,988
Don't brag about it.

687
00:43:40,697 --> 00:43:43,063
Was there any truth at all in that yarn?

688
00:43:43,466 --> 00:43:44,490
Some.

689
00:43:45,401 --> 00:43:46,663
Not very much.

690
00:43:47,971 --> 00:43:50,201
Well, we got all night.

691
00:43:51,207 --> 00:43:54,301
Coffee'll be ready soon.
We'll have a cup and try again.

692
00:43:54,444 --> 00:43:56,241
l'm so tired...

693
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,376
...so tired of lying and making up lies.

694
00:44:01,217 --> 00:44:03,879
Not knowing what is a lie
and what's the truth.

695
00:44:27,644 --> 00:44:29,976
l want to talk to Mr. Cairo. Joel Cairo.

696
00:44:35,018 --> 00:44:36,144
Thanks.

697
00:44:47,931 --> 00:44:49,091
Where is he?

698
00:44:50,533 --> 00:44:51,329
What?

699
00:44:51,401 --> 00:44:52,698
Where is he?

700
00:44:52,835 --> 00:44:53,767
Who?

701
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:54,994
Cairo.

702
00:44:55,171 --> 00:44:57,332
What do you think you're doin', kiddin' me?

703
00:44:57,407 --> 00:44:59,102
l'll tell you when l am.

704
00:44:59,375 --> 00:45:00,865
New York, aren't you?

705
00:45:01,044 --> 00:45:02,272
Shove off.

706
00:45:02,545 --> 00:45:04,877
You'll have to talk to me
before you're through.

707
00:45:04,948 --> 00:45:08,213
Some of you will,
and you can tell the fat man l said so.

708
00:45:09,452 --> 00:45:12,387
Keep askin' for it
and you're gonna get it, plenty.

709
00:45:13,389 --> 00:45:15,084
l told you to shove off.

710
00:45:15,491 --> 00:45:16,583
Shove off!

711
00:45:18,127 --> 00:45:20,254
People lose teeth talkin' like that.

712
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:22,924
lf you want to hang around,
you'll be polite.

713
00:45:28,638 --> 00:45:29,605
Luke.

714
00:45:35,545 --> 00:45:37,445
-Hello, Sam.
-Hello, Luke.

715
00:45:37,513 --> 00:45:39,947
Say, that was too bad about Miles.

716
00:45:40,116 --> 00:45:41,947
Yeah. lt was a tough break.

717
00:45:42,018 --> 00:45:43,918
l want to show you somethin'.

718
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:49,652
Why do you let these cheap gunmen
hang around the lobby...

719
00:45:49,726 --> 00:45:52,422
...with their heaters bulging
in their clothes?

720
00:45:55,198 --> 00:45:56,790
What do you want here?

721
00:46:00,503 --> 00:46:02,471
lf you don't want anything, beat it...

722
00:46:02,538 --> 00:46:04,165
...and don't come back!

723
00:46:06,576 --> 00:46:08,271
l won't forget you guys.

724
00:46:18,087 --> 00:46:21,181
-What is it?
-l don't know. l just spotted him.

725
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:25,322
-Say, what about Miles?
-l'll see you, Luke.

726
00:46:26,262 --> 00:46:27,695
-603.
-Yes, sir.

727
00:46:29,966 --> 00:46:31,194
Good morning.

728
00:46:31,534 --> 00:46:32,592
Good morning.

729
00:46:32,669 --> 00:46:34,330
Let's go where we can talk.

730
00:46:34,404 --> 00:46:38,306
Our private conversations have not been
such that l'm anxious to continue them.

731
00:46:38,374 --> 00:46:40,842
Forgive my speaking so bluntly
but it is the truth.

732
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:44,311
Last night? What could l do?
l had to. l don't know where the bird is.

733
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:47,679
Neither do you. She does.
How'll we get it if l don't play along?

734
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:50,412
You always have a very smooth
explanation ready, huh?

735
00:46:50,486 --> 00:46:52,454
Should l learn to stutter?

736
00:46:52,522 --> 00:46:55,184
Did Dundy take you to the station?
For how long?

737
00:46:55,258 --> 00:46:56,953
Till a little while ago.

738
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,427
-What'd they shake out of you?
-Shake out? Not one thing.

739
00:47:00,496 --> 00:47:03,556
l adhered to the course you indicated
earlier in your room...

740
00:47:03,633 --> 00:47:07,069
...but l wish you would have invented
a more reasonable story.

741
00:47:07,136 --> 00:47:09,400
l felt distinctly like an idiot repeating it.

742
00:47:09,472 --> 00:47:11,702
Don't worry about the story's goofiness.

743
00:47:11,774 --> 00:47:14,436
A sensible one would have had us all
in the cooler.

744
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:17,070
-You sure you didn't tell 'em anything?
-l did not.

745
00:47:17,146 --> 00:47:21,014
You'll want sleep, if you've been
standing up under a police grilling all night.

746
00:47:21,084 --> 00:47:22,244
l'll see you later.

747
00:47:22,385 --> 00:47:23,283
No, not yet.

748
00:47:26,756 --> 00:47:29,589
Yes, l'll have him call you
the minute he comes in.

749
00:47:29,659 --> 00:47:32,219
That's the third time she's called
this morning.

750
00:47:32,295 --> 00:47:33,762
Miss O'Shaughnessy's in there.

751
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:34,694
Anything else?

752
00:47:34,764 --> 00:47:38,427
The DA's office called.
Bryan would like to see you.

753
00:47:38,501 --> 00:47:40,298
And a Mr. Gutman called.

754
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:42,770
l said you weren't in.
He said, ''Please tell him...

755
00:47:42,839 --> 00:47:47,173
''...the young man gave me his message,
and that l phoned, and will phone again.''

756
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:49,070
Gutman, huh?

757
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:51,745
Thanks, darling.

758
00:47:53,683 --> 00:47:56,117
Darling! Somebody's been
in my apartment!

759
00:47:56,185 --> 00:48:00,178
lt's all upside down!
l changed as fast as l could and came over.

760
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:02,051
Did that boy follow you?

761
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:05,959
No, angel. l shook him off
long before l ever went to your place.

762
00:48:06,129 --> 00:48:09,155
lt might have been Cairo.
He wasn't at the hotel last night.

763
00:48:09,232 --> 00:48:12,463
He told me he'd been standing up
under a police grilling. l wonder.

764
00:48:12,535 --> 00:48:14,435
-You saw Joel this morning?
-Yeah.

765
00:48:14,504 --> 00:48:15,436
Why?

766
00:48:15,705 --> 00:48:18,003
Because, true love,
l need to keep in touch...

767
00:48:18,074 --> 00:48:22,534
...with all the loose ends of this dizzy affair
if l'm ever to make heads or tails of it.

768
00:48:22,612 --> 00:48:24,842
Now, we've got to find
a new home for you.

769
00:48:24,914 --> 00:48:26,779
l won't go back there!

770
00:48:28,551 --> 00:48:30,576
l got an idea. Wait a minute.

771
00:48:33,456 --> 00:48:35,447
What's your woman's intuition say
about her?

772
00:48:35,525 --> 00:48:38,722
She's all right. Maybe it's her own fault
for the trouble...

773
00:48:38,795 --> 00:48:40,387
...but she's all right.

774
00:48:40,463 --> 00:48:41,361
That's what l mean.

775
00:48:41,431 --> 00:48:43,592
Are you strong enough to put her up
for a bit?

776
00:48:43,666 --> 00:48:45,361
-You mean at home?
-Yeah.

777
00:48:45,501 --> 00:48:48,231
-ls she in any danger, Sam?
-l think she is.

778
00:48:48,571 --> 00:48:50,903
Gee, that'd scare Mom
into a green hemorrhage.

779
00:48:50,973 --> 00:48:54,409
l'll say she's a surprise witness
you're keeping undercover.

780
00:48:54,477 --> 00:48:55,842
You're a darling.

781
00:48:56,779 --> 00:48:57,905
Brigid.

782
00:48:58,781 --> 00:49:00,806
Effie has offered to put you up.

783
00:49:00,883 --> 00:49:02,111
That's very kind.

784
00:49:02,185 --> 00:49:04,085
Better start now.
Go out the back entrance.

785
00:49:04,153 --> 00:49:06,417
There's usually a cab parked
by the alleyway.

786
00:49:06,489 --> 00:49:09,014
Ride partway with her.
Be sure you're not followed.

787
00:49:09,091 --> 00:49:11,491
You better change cabs a few times
to be safe.

788
00:49:11,561 --> 00:49:12,459
l'll call Mom.

789
00:49:12,528 --> 00:49:15,224
There's time enough for that
when you get back.

790
00:49:15,531 --> 00:49:17,021
l'll call you later.

791
00:49:37,854 --> 00:49:38,878
Hello.

792
00:49:39,188 --> 00:49:40,746
This is Samuel Spade.

793
00:49:40,857 --> 00:49:43,826
Say, my secretary tells me
Mr. Bryan wants to see me.

794
00:49:45,194 --> 00:49:48,027
Yeah. Ask him what time's
most convenient for him.

795
00:49:48,598 --> 00:49:50,759
Spade. S-p-a-d-e.

796
00:49:51,767 --> 00:49:53,098
Hello, honey.

797
00:49:53,302 --> 00:49:54,234
Yeah.

798
00:49:54,637 --> 00:49:56,662
2:30. All right. Thanks.

799
00:49:57,206 --> 00:49:59,731
Sam, forgive me. Please forgive me.

800
00:50:00,443 --> 00:50:02,707
l sent those policemen to your place.

801
00:50:02,778 --> 00:50:05,941
l was mad, crazy with jealousy.
l phoned that if they went there...

802
00:50:06,015 --> 00:50:08,108
...they'd learn something
about Miles' murder.

803
00:50:08,184 --> 00:50:11,483
-What made you think of that?
-l was mad, Sam. l wanted to hurt you.

804
00:50:11,554 --> 00:50:14,216
-Did you tell 'em who you were?
-No. Sam, dearest, l--

805
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:15,382
Where'd you phone from?

806
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:17,221
The drugstore across from your place.

807
00:50:17,293 --> 00:50:19,853
Better hurry home
and think of what to tell the police.

808
00:50:19,929 --> 00:50:20,987
You'll hear from them.

809
00:50:21,063 --> 00:50:22,155
By the way...

810
00:50:22,331 --> 00:50:25,027
...where were you the night Miles
was murdered?

811
00:50:25,501 --> 00:50:26,490
Home.

812
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:28,396
-l was.
-No!

813
00:50:28,538 --> 00:50:31,371
But if that's your story,
it's all right with me.

814
00:50:32,308 --> 00:50:33,741
Now, you run along.

815
00:50:44,654 --> 00:50:45,621
Hello.

816
00:50:45,688 --> 00:50:47,178
Yeah, this is Spade.

817
00:50:47,557 --> 00:50:50,458
Yes, Mr. Gutman, l got it.
l've been waitin' to hear from you.

818
00:50:50,526 --> 00:50:53,893
Well, now? The sooner, the better.
Say 15 minutes. Right.

819
00:50:54,363 --> 00:50:55,387
12C.

820
00:50:56,432 --> 00:50:58,366
12C to your left, sir.

821
00:51:17,853 --> 00:51:18,945
Mr. Spade!

822
00:51:19,088 --> 00:51:20,817
How do you do, Mr. Gutman?

823
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:38,333
You begin well, sir.

824
00:51:38,407 --> 00:51:40,466
l distrust a man who says ''when.''

825
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:43,042
He's got to be careful
not to drink too much...

826
00:51:43,112 --> 00:51:45,410
...because he's not to be trusted
when he does.

827
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:46,641
Well, sir...

828
00:51:48,217 --> 00:51:51,152
...here's to plain speaking
and clear understanding.

829
00:51:59,762 --> 00:52:01,229
You're a close-mouthed man?

830
00:52:01,297 --> 00:52:02,559
No, l like to talk.

831
00:52:02,632 --> 00:52:05,533
Better and better.
l distrust a close-mouthed man.

832
00:52:06,302 --> 00:52:09,863
He generally picks the wrong time to talk
and says the wrong things.

833
00:52:09,939 --> 00:52:14,069
Talking's something you can't do
judiciously unless you keep in practice.

834
00:52:15,778 --> 00:52:17,905
Now, sir. We'll talk, if you like.

835
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:22,278
l'll tell you right out. l'm a man who likes
talking to a man who likes to talk.

836
00:52:22,351 --> 00:52:23,283
Swell!

837
00:52:23,486 --> 00:52:25,613
Will we talk about the black bird?

838
00:52:26,555 --> 00:52:28,113
You're the man for me, sir.

839
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:30,818
No beating about the bush.
Right to the point.

840
00:52:30,926 --> 00:52:33,190
Let's talk about the black bird,
by all means.

841
00:52:33,262 --> 00:52:34,820
First, answer me a question.

842
00:52:34,897 --> 00:52:37,798
Are you here as Miss O'Shaughnessy's
representative?

843
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,468
There's nothing certain either way.
lt depends.

844
00:52:40,536 --> 00:52:41,798
lt depends on?

845
00:52:42,638 --> 00:52:44,629
Maybe it depends on Joel Cairo.

846
00:52:44,807 --> 00:52:45,774
Maybe.

847
00:52:45,841 --> 00:52:48,969
The question is which do you represent?
lt'll be one or the other.

848
00:52:49,045 --> 00:52:50,569
l didn't say so.

849
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,539
-Who else is it?
-There's me.

850
00:52:56,318 --> 00:52:58,149
That's wonderful, sir, wonderful.

851
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:01,712
l do like a man who tells you right out
he's lookin' out for himself.

852
00:53:01,791 --> 00:53:03,019
Don't we all?

853
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,657
l don't trust a man who says he's not.

854
00:53:07,096 --> 00:53:09,326
Now, let's talk about the black bird.

855
00:53:09,465 --> 00:53:10,432
Let's.

856
00:53:10,966 --> 00:53:13,230
Mr. Spade, have you any conception...

857
00:53:13,636 --> 00:53:16,571
...of how much money can be got
for that black bird?

858
00:53:16,806 --> 00:53:17,670
No.

859
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:22,167
Well, sir, if l told you,
if l told you half, you'd call me a liar.

860
00:53:22,311 --> 00:53:24,074
No, not even if l thought so.

861
00:53:24,146 --> 00:53:27,411
But you tell me what it is,
and l'll figure out the profit.

862
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,950
You mean, you don't know
what that bird is?

863
00:53:33,022 --> 00:53:35,490
l know what it's supposed to look like...

864
00:53:35,558 --> 00:53:38,584
...and l know the value in human life
you people put on it.

865
00:53:38,728 --> 00:53:40,719
She didn't tell you what it is?

866
00:53:41,697 --> 00:53:44,962
-Cairo didn't either?
-He offered me $10,000 for it.

867
00:53:45,034 --> 00:53:46,262
$10,000!

868
00:53:46,769 --> 00:53:48,930
Dollars, mind you, not even pounds!

869
00:53:49,705 --> 00:53:52,572
Do they know what that bird is?
What is your impression?

870
00:53:52,641 --> 00:53:56,042
There's not much to go by.
Cairo didn't say he did or he didn't.

871
00:53:56,112 --> 00:53:59,411
She said she didn't but l took it for granted
she was lying.

872
00:53:59,482 --> 00:54:01,473
Not an injudicious thing to do.

873
00:54:02,818 --> 00:54:07,050
lf they don't know, l'm the only one
in the whole wide sweet world who does.

874
00:54:07,156 --> 00:54:09,989
Swell! When you've told me,
that'll make two of us.

875
00:54:10,059 --> 00:54:14,393
Mathematically correct, but l don't know
for certain that l'm going to tell you.

876
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:17,590
Don't be foolish. You know what it is.
l know where it is.

877
00:54:17,666 --> 00:54:19,293
Well, sir, where is it?

878
00:54:19,835 --> 00:54:23,828
You see, l must tell you what l know,
but you won't tell me what you know.

879
00:54:24,273 --> 00:54:26,070
lt's hardly equitable, sir.

880
00:54:26,642 --> 00:54:29,941
No, no. l don't think we can do business
along those lines.

881
00:54:30,012 --> 00:54:32,139
Well, think again, and think fast!

882
00:54:32,348 --> 00:54:34,942
l told that gunsel of yours
you'd have to talk to me!

883
00:54:35,017 --> 00:54:37,508
You'll talk to me today, or you are through!

884
00:54:37,586 --> 00:54:40,384
Why are you wasting my time?
l can get along without you!

885
00:54:40,456 --> 00:54:41,684
And another thing:

886
00:54:41,757 --> 00:54:44,157
Keep that gunsel out of my way
while you decide.

887
00:54:44,226 --> 00:54:46,057
l'll kill him, if you don't!

888
00:54:46,128 --> 00:54:49,097
Well, sir, l must say you have
a most violent temper.

889
00:54:50,032 --> 00:54:52,626
Think it over. You've got till 5:00.

890
00:54:53,135 --> 00:54:55,899
Then you're either in or out, for keeps!

891
00:55:20,429 --> 00:55:22,863
-Who killed Thursby?
-l don't know.

892
00:55:23,032 --> 00:55:25,057
But you could make an excellent guess.

893
00:55:25,134 --> 00:55:27,261
My guess might be excellent or crummy...

894
00:55:27,336 --> 00:55:30,499
...but Mrs. Spade didn't raise children
dippy enough to guess...

895
00:55:30,573 --> 00:55:33,872
...in front of a DA, an assistant DA
and a stenographer.

896
00:55:33,943 --> 00:55:35,672
Why not, if you've nothing to conceal?

897
00:55:35,744 --> 00:55:37,644
Everybody has something to conceal.

898
00:55:37,713 --> 00:55:40,477
l'm a sworn officer of the law
24 hours a day...

899
00:55:40,883 --> 00:55:44,216
...and neither formality nor informality
justifies you withholding...

900
00:55:44,286 --> 00:55:48,086
...the evidence of crime from me
except on constitutional grounds.

901
00:55:48,157 --> 00:55:50,284
You and the police have as much
as accused me...

902
00:55:50,359 --> 00:55:52,418
...of being mixed up in the murders.

903
00:55:52,494 --> 00:55:55,725
l've had trouble with both of you before,
and as far as l can see...

904
00:55:55,798 --> 00:55:58,733
...my best chance of clearing myself
of the trouble...

905
00:55:58,801 --> 00:56:01,031
...is by bringing in the murderers
all tied up.

906
00:56:01,103 --> 00:56:04,197
The only chance l've got of catching them
and bringing them in...

907
00:56:04,273 --> 00:56:07,674
...is by staying far away from you
because you'd only gum up the works.

908
00:56:07,743 --> 00:56:09,836
You getting this or am l goin' too fast?

909
00:56:09,912 --> 00:56:12,608
-No, sir. l'm getting it all right.
-Good work.

910
00:56:13,015 --> 00:56:15,745
lf you want to tell the board
l'm obstructing justice...

911
00:56:15,818 --> 00:56:18,150
...and ask them to revoke my license,
hop to it.

912
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:21,451
You tried it before and it didn't get you
anything but a good laugh.

913
00:56:21,523 --> 00:56:23,320
l don't want any more informal talks.

914
00:56:23,392 --> 00:56:26,919
l've nothing to say to you,
and l'm tired of being called things...

915
00:56:26,996 --> 00:56:30,261
...by every crackpot on the city payroll.
lf you want to see me...

916
00:56:30,332 --> 00:56:33,824
...pinch me or subpoena me.
l'll come down with my lawyer.

917
00:56:33,903 --> 00:56:35,871
l'll see you at the inquest, maybe!

918
00:56:39,475 --> 00:56:41,272
Come on. He wants to see you.

919
00:56:41,343 --> 00:56:45,211
l didn't expect you till 5:25.
l hope l haven't kept you waiting.

920
00:56:45,581 --> 00:56:46,775
Keep on ridin' me...

921
00:56:46,849 --> 00:56:49,647
...they're gonna be pickin' iron
out of your liver.

922
00:56:49,985 --> 00:56:52,886
The cheaper the crook,
the gaudier the patter, huh?

923
00:56:53,389 --> 00:56:54,686
Well, let's go.

924
00:57:15,644 --> 00:57:18,477
Come on. This'll put you in solid
with your boss.

925
00:57:27,122 --> 00:57:29,522
Come in, sir. Thank you for coming.
Come in.

926
00:57:29,591 --> 00:57:31,957
You shouldn't let him go around
with these on him.

927
00:57:32,027 --> 00:57:34,052
He might get himself hurt.

928
00:57:35,698 --> 00:57:37,029
Well, what's this?

929
00:57:37,099 --> 00:57:40,762
A crippled newsy took 'em away from him.
l made him give 'em back.

930
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:48,670
By gad, sir, you're a chap worth knowing.
An amazing character. Give me your hat.

931
00:57:53,148 --> 00:57:54,445
Sit down there.

932
00:58:00,289 --> 00:58:02,951
-l owe you an apology, sir.
-Never mind that.

933
00:58:03,292 --> 00:58:05,317
Let's talk about the black bird.

934
00:58:05,527 --> 00:58:07,119
All right, sir, let's.

935
00:58:10,265 --> 00:58:11,254
Let's.

936
00:58:12,401 --> 00:58:15,734
This is going to be the most astounding
thing you've ever heard of.

937
00:58:15,804 --> 00:58:19,035
l say this knowing that a man
of your caliber and your profession...

938
00:58:19,108 --> 00:58:22,134
...must have known
some astounding things in his time.

939
00:58:22,544 --> 00:58:26,173
What do you know of the Order of
the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem...

940
00:58:26,248 --> 00:58:28,409
...later known as the Knights of Rhodes?

941
00:58:28,484 --> 00:58:31,885
-Crusaders or something, weren't they?
-Very good. Sit down.

942
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:36,817
ln 1539, these crusading Knights...

943
00:58:36,892 --> 00:58:40,225
...persuaded Emperor Charles V
to give them the lsland of Malta.

944
00:58:40,295 --> 00:58:42,024
He made but one condition:

945
00:58:42,264 --> 00:58:44,755
That they pay him each year
the tribute of a falcon...

946
00:58:44,833 --> 00:58:47,495
...in acknowledgement that Malta
was still under Spain.

947
00:58:47,569 --> 00:58:49,161
Do you follow me?

948
00:58:51,106 --> 00:58:53,165
Have you any conception of the extreme...

949
00:58:53,242 --> 00:58:55,608
...the immeasurable wealth
of the Order of that time?

950
00:58:55,677 --> 00:58:57,304
They were pretty well fixed.

951
00:58:57,379 --> 00:59:00,940
''Pretty well'' is putting it mildly.
They were rolling in wealth, sir.

952
00:59:01,016 --> 00:59:04,577
For years they'd taken from the East
nobody knows what spoils of gems...

953
00:59:04,653 --> 00:59:06,951
...precious metals, silks, ivory, sir.

954
00:59:07,122 --> 00:59:10,717
We all know the Holy Wars to them
were largely a matter of loot.

955
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:14,788
The Knights were profoundly grateful
to the Emperor Charles...

956
00:59:14,863 --> 00:59:16,990
...for his generosity toward them.

957
00:59:17,066 --> 00:59:18,966
They hit upon the thought of sending...

958
00:59:19,034 --> 00:59:22,595
...for his first year's tribute,
not an insignificant live bird...

959
00:59:23,172 --> 00:59:25,299
...but a glorious golden falcon...

960
00:59:25,507 --> 00:59:27,475
...crusted from head to foot...

961
00:59:27,543 --> 00:59:30,068
...with the finest jewels in their coffers.

962
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,169
Well, sir...

963
00:59:32,247 --> 00:59:34,477
-...what do you think of that?
-l don't know.

964
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:36,484
These are facts, historical facts...

965
00:59:36,552 --> 00:59:40,784
...not schoolbook history, not Mr. Wells'
history, but history, nevertheless.

966
00:59:40,923 --> 00:59:43,653
They sent this foot-high jeweled bird
to Charles in Spain.

967
00:59:43,725 --> 00:59:46,990
They sent it in a galley commanded
by a member of the Order.

968
00:59:48,063 --> 00:59:49,963
lt never reached Spain.

969
00:59:50,466 --> 00:59:52,559
A famous admiral of buccaneers...

970
00:59:53,001 --> 00:59:55,469
...took the Knights' galley and the bird.

971
00:59:56,004 --> 00:59:58,802
ln 1 713 it turned up in Sicily.

972
00:59:59,675 --> 01:00:02,200
ln 1840 it appeared in Paris.

973
01:00:02,444 --> 01:00:05,538
lt had, by that time,
acquired a coat of black enamel...

974
01:00:05,614 --> 01:00:09,710
...so that it looked nothing more
than a fairly interesting black statuette.

975
01:00:09,985 --> 01:00:13,682
ln that disguise, sir, it was,
as you may say, kicked around Paris...

976
01:00:14,189 --> 01:00:17,249
...for over three score years
by private owners too stupid...

977
01:00:17,326 --> 01:00:19,260
...to see what it was under the skin.

978
01:00:19,328 --> 01:00:20,352
Then...

979
01:00:21,163 --> 01:00:23,791
...in 1923 a Greek dealer...

980
01:00:24,299 --> 01:00:27,791
...named Charilaos Konstantinides found it
in an obscure shop.

981
01:00:29,404 --> 01:00:32,999
No thickness of enamel could conceal value
from his eyes.

982
01:00:37,045 --> 01:00:40,344
-You begin to believe me a little?
-l haven't said l didn't.

983
01:00:40,482 --> 01:00:44,976
Well, sir, to hold it safe while pursuing
his researches into its history...

984
01:00:45,621 --> 01:00:47,782
...Charilaos re-enameled the bird.

985
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:51,817
Despite this precaution, however,
l got wind of his find.

986
01:00:54,696 --> 01:00:56,687
lf l'd only known a few days sooner.

987
01:00:56,765 --> 01:00:58,323
l was in London when l heard.

988
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,630
l packed a bag,
got on the boat train immediately.

989
01:01:00,702 --> 01:01:04,103
On the train l read in the Times,
that Charilaos's establishment...

990
01:01:04,173 --> 01:01:06,641
...had been burglarized and him murdered.

991
01:01:06,742 --> 01:01:10,200
Sure enough, on arriving there
l discovered the bird was gone.

992
01:01:12,247 --> 01:01:13,805
That was 1 7 years ago.

993
01:01:14,783 --> 01:01:18,549
Well, sir, it took me 1 7 years
to locate that bird, but l did.

994
01:01:19,388 --> 01:01:20,685
l wanted it!

995
01:01:20,923 --> 01:01:23,790
l'm a man not easily discouraged
when l want something.

996
01:01:23,859 --> 01:01:25,952
l traced it to the home
of a Russian general...

997
01:01:26,028 --> 01:01:30,192
...one Kemidov, in an lstanbul suburb.
He didn't know a thing about it.

998
01:01:30,299 --> 01:01:32,460
lt was only a black enameled figure
to him...

999
01:01:32,534 --> 01:01:35,264
...but his contrariness kept him
from selling it to me...

1000
01:01:35,337 --> 01:01:38,795
...when l made him an offer.
So l sent him some agents to get it.

1001
01:01:39,474 --> 01:01:40,634
Well, sir...

1002
01:01:40,809 --> 01:01:43,107
...they got it and l haven't got it...

1003
01:01:43,645 --> 01:01:45,738
...but l'm going to get it.

1004
01:01:47,416 --> 01:01:48,542
Your glass.

1005
01:01:48,951 --> 01:01:52,819
Then, the bird doesn't really belong
to any of you, but to a General Kemidov?

1006
01:01:52,888 --> 01:01:56,483
Well, sir, you might as well say
it belonged to the King of Spain.

1007
01:01:57,226 --> 01:02:00,753
l don't see how you can honestly grant
anyone else a clear title to it...

1008
01:02:00,829 --> 01:02:02,922
...except by right of possession.

1009
01:02:03,532 --> 01:02:04,829
And now, sir...

1010
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:08,565
...before we start to talk prices,
how soon can you...

1011
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:11,204
...or how soon are you willing
to produce the falcon?

1012
01:02:11,273 --> 01:02:13,639
-A couple of days.
-That is satisfactory.

1013
01:02:14,676 --> 01:02:18,635
Well, sir, here's to a fair bargain!
Profits large enough for both of us!

1014
01:02:18,914 --> 01:02:20,973
What's your idea of a fair bargain?

1015
01:02:21,049 --> 01:02:24,348
l will give you $25,000 when you deliver
the falcon to me...

1016
01:02:25,153 --> 01:02:26,882
...and another $25,000 later on.

1017
01:02:26,955 --> 01:02:30,391
Or l will give you one quarter
of what l realize on the falcon.

1018
01:02:30,459 --> 01:02:32,290
That would amount
to a vastly greater sum.

1019
01:02:32,361 --> 01:02:35,387
-How much greater?
-Who knows? Shall we say $100,000?

1020
01:02:35,664 --> 01:02:38,258
Will you believe me if l name
the probable minimum?

1021
01:02:38,333 --> 01:02:39,459
Why not?

1022
01:02:39,635 --> 01:02:42,229
What would you say
to a quarter of a million?

1023
01:02:44,339 --> 01:02:46,569
Then you think the dingus
is worth a million?

1024
01:02:46,642 --> 01:02:48,473
ln your own words, why not?

1025
01:02:52,347 --> 01:02:55,043
-That's a lot of dough.
-A lot of dough.

1026
01:02:57,586 --> 01:02:59,349
The minimum? What's the maximum?

1027
01:02:59,421 --> 01:03:01,548
The maximum, l refuse to guess.

1028
01:03:02,858 --> 01:03:04,382
You'd think me crazy.

1029
01:03:04,626 --> 01:03:05,854
l don't know.

1030
01:03:06,561 --> 01:03:09,189
There's no telling how high it could go, sir.

1031
01:03:09,364 --> 01:03:12,094
That is the one and only truth about it.

1032
01:03:29,351 --> 01:03:30,409
Wilmer!

1033
01:04:58,607 --> 01:05:00,234
Hello, Effie. lt's me.

1034
01:05:00,575 --> 01:05:02,702
Let me talk to Miss O'Shaughnessy.

1035
01:05:03,545 --> 01:05:04,910
She isn't there?

1036
01:05:07,783 --> 01:05:09,512
What? She didn't show up?

1037
01:05:12,087 --> 01:05:15,784
You get on back to the office and
wait there till l come or you hear from me.

1038
01:05:15,857 --> 01:05:18,417
Yeah, let's do something right
for a change.

1039
01:06:11,346 --> 01:06:13,837
lt started in the hold aft,
in the rear basement.

1040
01:06:13,915 --> 01:06:15,610
What insurance was she carrying?

1041
01:06:15,684 --> 01:06:16,776
-Anybody burn?
-No.

1042
01:06:16,852 --> 01:06:18,945
Only the harbor watch was aboard!

1043
01:06:20,522 --> 01:06:22,183
-Someone l know came--
-What?

1044
01:06:22,257 --> 01:06:24,384
Someone l know came aboard
this afternoon.

1045
01:06:24,459 --> 01:06:26,689
l haven't seen her since. l'm worried.

1046
01:06:26,761 --> 01:06:29,594
No reason to be, mister.
Everybody got off all right.

1047
01:06:29,664 --> 01:06:33,498
l wonder if you saw her.
She's kind of small, about 5-foot--

1048
01:06:33,568 --> 01:06:38,062
l couldn't tell you, mister.
But if she came aboard she got off all right.

1049
01:06:38,306 --> 01:06:41,571
Only the harbor watch was aboard
when the fire started.

1050
01:06:43,845 --> 01:06:46,279
Now you know as much about it
as l do, precious.

1051
01:06:46,348 --> 01:06:48,908
Maybe they went down to the ship.
Maybe they didn't.

1052
01:06:48,984 --> 01:06:51,248
The part about the bird is thrilling.

1053
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,515
Or ridiculous.

1054
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,360
You know....

1055
01:07:09,237 --> 01:07:10,226
Falcon.

1056
01:07:16,811 --> 01:07:18,301
Lock that door.

1057
01:07:35,897 --> 01:07:36,989
ls he....

1058
01:07:37,566 --> 01:07:39,227
-ls he....
-Yeah.

1059
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:44,803
He couldn't have come far
with those holes in him.

1060
01:07:52,547 --> 01:07:56,210
Why couldn't he have stayed alive
long enough to tell us something?

1061
01:07:57,252 --> 01:08:00,153
Here, here, here, none of that now.
Come on.

1062
01:08:01,389 --> 01:08:03,152
You can't pass out on me now.

1063
01:08:03,224 --> 01:08:04,521
All right, Sam.

1064
01:08:13,301 --> 01:08:14,928
Do you really think....

1065
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:31,810
-We've got it, angel, we've got it.
-You're hurting me.

1066
01:08:33,855 --> 01:08:35,220
Answer the phone.

1067
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,349
Hello.

1068
01:08:39,594 --> 01:08:40,583
Yes?

1069
01:08:41,196 --> 01:08:42,185
Who?

1070
01:08:44,432 --> 01:08:45,558
Oh, yes.

1071
01:08:46,434 --> 01:08:47,458
Where?

1072
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:49,530
Yes, yes.

1073
01:08:51,406 --> 01:08:53,271
Hello! Hello! Hello!

1074
01:08:53,608 --> 01:08:56,406
lt was Miss O'Shaughnessy!
She wants you! She's in danger!

1075
01:08:56,478 --> 01:08:58,207
-Where is she?
-Burlingame, 26 Ancho.

1076
01:08:58,279 --> 01:08:59,678
Her voice, it was awful!

1077
01:08:59,748 --> 01:09:02,842
Something happened to her
before she could finish. Go help her!

1078
01:09:02,917 --> 01:09:06,353
You've got to go to her! See?
He was helping her and they killed him....

1079
01:09:06,421 --> 01:09:07,888
You've got to go, Sam!

1080
01:09:07,956 --> 01:09:09,423
All right, l'll go!

1081
01:09:09,991 --> 01:09:11,959
After l've gone, you phone the police.

1082
01:09:12,027 --> 01:09:14,427
Tell 'em how it happened,
but don't say any names!

1083
01:09:14,496 --> 01:09:17,590
l got the call and told you l had to go,
but l didn't say where.

1084
01:09:17,666 --> 01:09:20,362
Forget about this.
Tell 'em how it happened, but without this.

1085
01:09:20,435 --> 01:09:23,529
Get that straight.
Everything happened exactly as it did...

1086
01:09:23,605 --> 01:09:26,597
...but without the bundle,
and l got the phone call, not you.

1087
01:09:26,675 --> 01:09:27,664
Yes, Sam.

1088
01:09:27,809 --> 01:09:28,798
Okay.

1089
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:35,611
Shut this door and lock it
and don't open it till the police come.

1090
01:09:35,684 --> 01:09:36,946
Do you know who he is?

1091
01:09:37,018 --> 01:09:40,249
Yeah! Yeah, he's Captain Jacoby,
master of the La Paloma.

1092
01:09:40,922 --> 01:09:42,753
You're a good man, sister!

1093
01:10:03,645 --> 01:10:05,670
-May l borrow your pencil?
-Sure.

1094
01:10:31,606 --> 01:10:33,403
-Say, Frank?
-Hello, Mr. Spade.

1095
01:10:33,475 --> 01:10:35,170
-You got plenty of gas?
-Sure thing.

1096
01:10:35,243 --> 01:10:37,370
Do you know where Ancho Street
is in Burlingame?

1097
01:10:37,445 --> 01:10:38,844
No, but we'll find her.

1098
01:10:38,913 --> 01:10:41,711
Well, 26 is the number
and the sooner the better.

1099
01:10:51,259 --> 01:10:52,954
Keep your motor running.

1100
01:11:19,154 --> 01:11:21,281
-Bum steer, Mr. Spade?
-Yeah.

1101
01:11:27,729 --> 01:11:29,526
Let's get to a phone booth.

1102
01:11:30,231 --> 01:11:32,290
Hello, Mrs. Perine? ls Effie there?

1103
01:11:32,367 --> 01:11:33,561
Yes, please.

1104
01:11:35,036 --> 01:11:37,402
Hello, precious! What's the good news?

1105
01:11:37,806 --> 01:11:41,173
No, no. lt was a bum steer.
Are you sure that was her voice?

1106
01:11:41,576 --> 01:11:43,043
Well, it was hooey.

1107
01:11:43,711 --> 01:11:47,010
Everything go all right?
Nothing said about the bundle, huh?

1108
01:11:47,248 --> 01:11:48,408
That's swell.

1109
01:11:48,483 --> 01:11:50,644
Did they take you down to the Hall?

1110
01:11:51,886 --> 01:11:53,080
All right, precious.

1111
01:11:53,154 --> 01:11:56,954
You'd better hit the hay and
get a good night's rest. You sound all in.

1112
01:11:57,025 --> 01:11:59,858
No. Save it till tomorrow.
l'm going on home.

1113
01:12:05,767 --> 01:12:08,793
-Thanks. Good night, Frank.
-Good night, Mr. Spade.

1114
01:12:15,343 --> 01:12:17,937
l've been hiding in a doorway up the street.

1115
01:12:18,279 --> 01:12:20,076
l thought you'd never come.

1116
01:12:29,691 --> 01:12:31,784
Can you make it or shall l carry you?

1117
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:35,728
l'll be all right as soon as l can
get some place where l can lie down.

1118
01:12:49,077 --> 01:12:50,305
Well, we're all here.

1119
01:12:50,378 --> 01:12:53,176
Let's come in and sit down
and be comfortable and talk.

1120
01:12:53,248 --> 01:12:54,237
Sure.

1121
01:12:55,149 --> 01:12:58,676
-Get away! You're not gonna frisk me.
-Stand still! Shut up!

1122
01:12:58,753 --> 01:13:01,347
Take your paws off me
or l'll make you use that gun.

1123
01:13:01,422 --> 01:13:04,357
Ask your boss if he wants me shot up
before we talk.

1124
01:13:04,659 --> 01:13:06,126
Never mind, Wilmer.

1125
01:13:07,962 --> 01:13:10,658
You certainly are
a most headstrong individual.

1126
01:13:10,999 --> 01:13:12,864
Well, let's be seated.

1127
01:13:15,703 --> 01:13:19,298
Are you ready to make the first payment
and take the falcon off my hands?

1128
01:13:19,374 --> 01:13:21,365
Well, sir, as to that....

1129
01:13:22,677 --> 01:13:23,939
As to that....

1130
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:31,742
$10,000? We were talkin' about
a lot more money than this.

1131
01:13:31,819 --> 01:13:34,879
Yes, sir, we were.
But this is genuine coin of the realm.

1132
01:13:34,956 --> 01:13:37,356
With a dollar of this
you can buy $10 of talk.

1133
01:13:37,425 --> 01:13:39,825
There are more of us
to be taken care of now.

1134
01:13:39,894 --> 01:13:42,055
That may be, but l've got the falcon!

1135
01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:44,724
l shouldn't think it necessary
to remind you...

1136
01:13:44,799 --> 01:13:47,734
...that you may have the falcon,
but we certainly have you.

1137
01:13:47,835 --> 01:13:51,293
l'm trying not to let that worry me.
We'll get back to the money later on.

1138
01:13:51,372 --> 01:13:53,966
There's something else
to be discussed first.

1139
01:13:56,144 --> 01:13:57,975
We've got to have a fall guy.

1140
01:13:58,046 --> 01:14:01,709
The police need a victim, somebody
they can pin those three murders on.

1141
01:14:01,783 --> 01:14:05,378
Three? There's only two, because
Thursby certainly killed your partner.

1142
01:14:05,453 --> 01:14:08,854
Only two then. What's the difference?
We've got to give the police--

1143
01:14:08,923 --> 01:14:12,450
Come, come, Mr. Spade, you can't
expect us to believe at this late date...

1144
01:14:12,527 --> 01:14:16,293
...that you're afraid of the police,
or that you're not quite able to handle--

1145
01:14:16,364 --> 01:14:17,854
l'm in this up to my neck.

1146
01:14:17,932 --> 01:14:22,301
l've got to find somebody, a victim
when the time comes. lf l don't, l'll be it.

1147
01:14:27,642 --> 01:14:29,439
Let's give them the gunsel.

1148
01:14:30,111 --> 01:14:32,875
He actually did shoot Thursby
and Jacoby, didn't he?

1149
01:14:32,947 --> 01:14:35,711
Anyway, he's made to order for the part.
Look at him!

1150
01:14:35,783 --> 01:14:37,410
Let's give him to them.

1151
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:42,316
By gad, sir, you are a character.
That you are!

1152
01:14:42,557 --> 01:14:45,219
There's never any telling
what you'll say or do next...

1153
01:14:45,293 --> 01:14:47,284
...but it's bound to be astonishing.

1154
01:14:47,362 --> 01:14:49,330
lt's our best bet. With him in their hands--

1155
01:14:49,397 --> 01:14:52,560
But, my dear man, can't you see
that if l even for a moment...

1156
01:14:52,633 --> 01:14:55,227
...thought of doing such a thing....
That's ridiculous.

1157
01:14:55,303 --> 01:14:58,830
l feel towards Wilmer here just exactly
as if he were my own son.

1158
01:14:59,107 --> 01:15:00,131
Really, l do.

1159
01:15:00,208 --> 01:15:03,143
But if l even for a moment thought
of doing what you propose...

1160
01:15:03,211 --> 01:15:06,544
...what in the world would keep Wilmer
from telling the police...

1161
01:15:06,614 --> 01:15:09,082
...every last detail about the falcon and all--

1162
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:10,549
Let him talk his head off.

1163
01:15:10,618 --> 01:15:13,416
l'll guarantee you
nobody'll do anything about it.

1164
01:15:14,055 --> 01:15:16,888
Well, what do you think of this, Wilmer?
Mighty funny, eh?

1165
01:15:16,958 --> 01:15:18,357
Mighty funny.

1166
01:15:22,063 --> 01:15:24,531
How do you feel now?
Any better, precious?

1167
01:15:24,632 --> 01:15:25,826
Much better.

1168
01:15:26,601 --> 01:15:28,000
But l'm frightened.

1169
01:15:28,069 --> 01:15:30,936
Don't be. Nothing very bad's
going to happen here.

1170
01:15:31,205 --> 01:15:33,002
Do you want a drink, angel?

1171
01:15:33,508 --> 01:15:34,873
Be careful, Sam.

1172
01:15:37,979 --> 01:15:38,946
Well?

1173
01:15:39,013 --> 01:15:43,609
lf you're really serious, the least we can do
in common politeness is to hear you out.

1174
01:15:43,684 --> 01:15:48,348
Now, how would you be able to fix it
so that Wilmer couldn't do us any harm?

1175
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:51,484
l can show Bryan, our DA,
that if he goes around...

1176
01:15:51,559 --> 01:15:54,460
...tryin' to collect everybody
he'll have a tangled case...

1177
01:15:54,529 --> 01:15:58,226
...but if he sticks to Wilmer here,
he can get a conviction...

1178
01:15:58,533 --> 01:16:00,228
...standing on his head.

1179
01:16:03,471 --> 01:16:05,132
Get up on your feet.

1180
01:16:05,206 --> 01:16:08,039
l've taken all the riding from you
l'm gonna take.

1181
01:16:08,476 --> 01:16:10,000
Get up and shoot it out!

1182
01:16:10,078 --> 01:16:11,739
Young Wild West!

1183
01:16:11,913 --> 01:16:15,041
You should tell him that shootin' me
before you get the falcon...

1184
01:16:15,116 --> 01:16:16,378
...will be bad for business.

1185
01:16:16,451 --> 01:16:19,045
Now, now, Wilmer.
We can't have any of that.

1186
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:21,645
You shouldn't attach
such importance to these things.

1187
01:16:21,722 --> 01:16:23,280
Tell him to lay off me then.

1188
01:16:23,357 --> 01:16:24,654
Now, Wilmer....

1189
01:16:26,894 --> 01:16:31,593
Your plan is, not at all satisfactory, sir.
Let's not say anything more about it.

1190
01:16:31,666 --> 01:16:33,725
All right. l've got another suggestion.

1191
01:16:33,801 --> 01:16:36,736
Maybe not as good as the first,
but it's better than nothing.

1192
01:16:36,804 --> 01:16:37,862
Want to hear it?

1193
01:16:37,939 --> 01:16:39,372
Most assuredly.

1194
01:16:43,611 --> 01:16:44,976
Give them Cairo.

1195
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:46,942
Well, by gad, sir--

1196
01:16:47,014 --> 01:16:49,642
Suppose we give them you
or Miss O'Shaughnessy?

1197
01:16:49,717 --> 01:16:51,514
You want the falcon. l've got it.

1198
01:16:51,586 --> 01:16:55,249
The fall guy's part of the price l'm asking.
As for Miss O'Shaughnessy...

1199
01:16:55,323 --> 01:16:59,225
...if you think she can be rigged for the part
l'm willing to discuss it with you.

1200
01:16:59,293 --> 01:17:03,093
You seem to forget that you are not
in a position to insist upon anything.

1201
01:17:03,164 --> 01:17:04,392
Now, come, gentlemen.

1202
01:17:04,465 --> 01:17:07,093
Let's keep our discussion
on a friendly basis.

1203
01:17:07,835 --> 01:17:10,895
There certainly is something
in what Mr. Cairo said....

1204
01:17:11,572 --> 01:17:14,632
lf you kill me,
how are you gonna get the bird?

1205
01:17:15,109 --> 01:17:18,943
lf l know you can't afford to kill me,
how'll you scare me into giving it to you?

1206
01:17:19,013 --> 01:17:23,177
Sir, there are other means of persuasion
besides killing and threatening to kill.

1207
01:17:23,251 --> 01:17:24,548
Yes, that's....

1208
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:27,047
That's true.

1209
01:17:28,923 --> 01:17:32,916
But none of them are any good
unless the threat of death is behind them.

1210
01:17:32,994 --> 01:17:34,256
You see what l mean?

1211
01:17:34,328 --> 01:17:38,992
lf you start something, l'll make it a matter
of your having to kill me or call it off.

1212
01:17:40,334 --> 01:17:44,566
That's an attitude, sir, that calls for
the most delicate judgment on both sides.

1213
01:17:44,639 --> 01:17:46,903
Because, as you know,
in the heat of action...

1214
01:17:46,974 --> 01:17:49,943
...men are likely to forget where
their best interests lie...

1215
01:17:50,011 --> 01:17:52,343
...and let their emotions carry them away.

1216
01:17:52,413 --> 01:17:55,678
And the trick from my angle is
to make my play strong enough...

1217
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:58,685
...to tie you up, but not make you
mad enough to bump me off...

1218
01:17:58,753 --> 01:18:00,015
...against your better judgment.

1219
01:18:00,087 --> 01:18:02,487
By gad, sir, you are a character.

1220
01:18:08,362 --> 01:18:11,160
They're selling you out, sonny.

1221
01:18:11,799 --> 01:18:14,233
l hope you're not influenced by the guns...

1222
01:18:14,302 --> 01:18:17,135
...these pocket-edition desperadoes
are waving around.

1223
01:18:17,205 --> 01:18:20,402
Because l've practiced taking guns away
from these boys before...

1224
01:18:20,474 --> 01:18:22,601
...so we'll have no trouble there.

1225
01:18:23,077 --> 01:18:24,510
-Wilmer, here--
-All right.

1226
01:18:24,579 --> 01:18:25,568
Wilmer!

1227
01:18:57,979 --> 01:18:59,412
There's our fall guy.

1228
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:02,677
Either say yes right now
or l'll turn the falcon and all of you in.

1229
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:04,081
l don't like that, sir.

1230
01:19:04,151 --> 01:19:06,278
Well, you won't like it. Well?

1231
01:19:11,092 --> 01:19:12,684
You can have him.

1232
01:19:14,262 --> 01:19:17,129
l won't be able to get the falcon
till daylight, maybe later.

1233
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:20,326
lt'd be best for us all
if we didn't leave each other's sight...

1234
01:19:20,401 --> 01:19:23,802
...until our business has been transacted.
You have the envelope?

1235
01:19:23,871 --> 01:19:26,066
Miss O'Shaughnessy has it. Hang on to it.

1236
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:29,507
We won't lose sight of each other.
The dingus'll be brought to us here.

1237
01:19:29,577 --> 01:19:31,204
Excellent, sir, excellent!

1238
01:19:31,279 --> 01:19:33,611
Then in exchange for
the $10,000 and Wilmer...

1239
01:19:33,681 --> 01:19:36,309
...you'll give us the falcon
and an hour or two of grace.

1240
01:19:36,384 --> 01:19:38,750
Now, let's get the details fixed, first.

1241
01:19:38,819 --> 01:19:43,188
Why did he shoot Thursby and why, where
and how did he shoot Captain Jacoby?

1242
01:19:43,257 --> 01:19:47,284
l've got to know all that happened
so the parts that don't fit are covered up.

1243
01:19:47,361 --> 01:19:49,386
l shall be candid with you, sir.

1244
01:19:49,463 --> 01:19:51,693
Thursby was Miss O'Shaughnessy's ally.

1245
01:19:51,766 --> 01:19:54,098
We believed that disposing of him
as we did...

1246
01:19:54,168 --> 01:19:58,104
...would cause Miss O'Shaughnessy to stop
and think that it would be best...

1247
01:19:58,172 --> 01:20:01,471
...to patch up her differences with us
regarding the falcon.

1248
01:20:01,709 --> 01:20:04,678
You didn't try to make a deal
before giving him the works?

1249
01:20:04,745 --> 01:20:06,940
We did. Yes, sir. We most certainly did.

1250
01:20:07,014 --> 01:20:10,506
l talked to him myself that very night,
but l could do nothing with him.

1251
01:20:10,584 --> 01:20:13,576
He was quite determinedly loyal
to Miss O'Shaughnessy.

1252
01:20:14,755 --> 01:20:18,122
So Wilmer followed him back to the hotel
and did what he did!

1253
01:20:18,693 --> 01:20:20,285
That sounds all right.

1254
01:20:21,395 --> 01:20:22,692
Now, Jacoby.

1255
01:20:24,198 --> 01:20:28,100
Captain Jacoby's death was entirely
Miss O'Shaughnessy's fault.

1256
01:20:29,470 --> 01:20:30,767
Tell me what happened.

1257
01:20:30,838 --> 01:20:33,329
Cairo, as you must have surmised,
contacted me...

1258
01:20:33,407 --> 01:20:36,274
...after he left police headquarters
last night or morning.

1259
01:20:36,344 --> 01:20:39,313
He recognized the mutual advantage
of pooling forces.

1260
01:20:39,714 --> 01:20:41,978
Mr. Cairo is a man of nice judgment.

1261
01:20:42,316 --> 01:20:45,774
The Paloma was his thought.
He read of its arrival in the papers...

1262
01:20:45,853 --> 01:20:48,151
...and remembered he had heard
in Hong Kong...

1263
01:20:48,222 --> 01:20:51,453
...that Jacoby and Miss O'Shaughnessy
were seen together....

1264
01:20:54,695 --> 01:20:56,720
Well, sir, he saw that notice and...

1265
01:20:56,797 --> 01:20:59,357
...putting two and two together
guessed the truth.

1266
01:20:59,433 --> 01:21:02,095
She had given the bird to Jacoby
to bring here for her.

1267
01:21:02,169 --> 01:21:04,637
And at that juncture
you decided to slip me a mickey.

1268
01:21:04,705 --> 01:21:07,139
There's no place for you in our plan, sir.

1269
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:10,507
So we decided to spare ourselves
any possible embarrassment.

1270
01:21:11,712 --> 01:21:14,943
Mr. Cairo and Wilmer and l went
to call on Captain Jacoby.

1271
01:21:15,616 --> 01:21:18,983
We were lucky enough to arrive
while Miss O'Shaughnessy was there.

1272
01:21:19,053 --> 01:21:22,511
ln many ways, the conference was difficult,
but we finally persuaded...

1273
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:25,684
...Miss O'Shaughnessy to come to terms,
or so we thought.

1274
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,228
We then left the boat
and set out for my hotel...

1275
01:21:28,295 --> 01:21:31,731
...where l was to pay Miss O'Shaughnessy
and receive the bird.

1276
01:21:31,866 --> 01:21:34,494
Well, sir, we mere men
should have known better.

1277
01:21:34,568 --> 01:21:37,128
En route, she, Captain Jacoby
and the falcon...

1278
01:21:37,204 --> 01:21:39,672
...slipped completely through our fingers.

1279
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:42,508
lt was neatly done, sir. lndeed, it was.

1280
01:21:43,377 --> 01:21:45,538
You touched off the boat before you left?

1281
01:21:45,613 --> 01:21:47,080
No, not intentionally.

1282
01:21:47,148 --> 01:21:50,879
Though, we, or Wilmer at least,
were responsible for the fire.

1283
01:21:50,951 --> 01:21:55,479
While the rest of us were talking
in the cabin, Wilmer went about the boat...

1284
01:21:55,990 --> 01:21:57,890
...trying to find the falcon.

1285
01:21:58,826 --> 01:22:01,056
No doubt, he was careless with matches.

1286
01:22:01,128 --> 01:22:02,686
Now, about the shooting?

1287
01:22:02,763 --> 01:22:06,290
We caught up with Miss O'Shaughnessy
and Jacoby at her apartment.

1288
01:22:06,367 --> 01:22:10,360
l sent Wilmer downstairs to cover
the fire escape before ringing the bell.

1289
01:22:10,805 --> 01:22:14,366
And, sure enough, while she was asking us
who we were through the door...

1290
01:22:14,442 --> 01:22:17,138
...and we were telling her,
we heard a window go up.

1291
01:22:17,211 --> 01:22:20,237
Wilmer shot Jacoby
as he was coming down the fire escape...

1292
01:22:20,314 --> 01:22:24,307
...shot him more than once, but Jacoby
was too tough to fall or drop the falcon.

1293
01:22:24,385 --> 01:22:28,219
He climbed down the rest of the way,
knocked Wilmer over, and ran off.

1294
01:22:29,657 --> 01:22:33,388
We persuaded, that is the word, sir,
we persuaded Miss O'Shaughnessy...

1295
01:22:33,461 --> 01:22:36,521
...to tell us where she told
Captain Jacoby to take the falcon.

1296
01:22:36,597 --> 01:22:39,065
We further persuaded her
to phone your office...

1297
01:22:39,133 --> 01:22:42,261
...in an attempt to draw you away,
before Jacoby got there...

1298
01:22:42,336 --> 01:22:43,928
...but unfortunately for us...

1299
01:22:44,004 --> 01:22:47,269
...it had taken us too long
to persuade Miss O'Shaughnessy.

1300
01:22:47,441 --> 01:22:49,466
You had the falcon
before we could reach you.

1301
01:23:05,025 --> 01:23:07,926
Wilmer, l'm sorry to lose you,
but l want you to know...

1302
01:23:07,995 --> 01:23:10,725
...l couldn't be fonder of you
if you were my own son.

1303
01:23:10,798 --> 01:23:13,824
Well, if you lose a son,
it's possible to get another.

1304
01:23:14,401 --> 01:23:16,392
There's only one Maltese Falcon.

1305
01:23:17,838 --> 01:23:21,137
When you're young,
you simply don't understand these things.

1306
01:23:23,177 --> 01:23:24,508
How about some coffee?

1307
01:23:24,578 --> 01:23:25,772
Put the pot on, will you?

1308
01:23:25,846 --> 01:23:27,939
l don't like to leave our guests.

1309
01:23:28,315 --> 01:23:29,179
Surely.

1310
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:33,084
Just a moment, my dear. Hadn't you
better leave the envelope in here?

1311
01:23:34,822 --> 01:23:38,656
-Sit on it, if you're afraid of losing it.
-You misunderstand me. lt's not that.

1312
01:23:38,726 --> 01:23:42,184
But business should be transacted
in a businesslike manner.

1313
01:23:43,998 --> 01:23:47,024
For instance,
there are only nine bills here now.

1314
01:23:47,101 --> 01:23:50,628
There were ten when l handed them
to you, as you very well know.

1315
01:23:57,411 --> 01:23:58,309
Well?

1316
01:23:58,612 --> 01:24:00,307
l want to know about this.

1317
01:24:08,188 --> 01:24:09,450
You palmed it.

1318
01:24:09,657 --> 01:24:10,749
-l palmed it?
-Yes.

1319
01:24:10,824 --> 01:24:12,883
Do you want to say so, or stand for a frisk?

1320
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:16,191
You'll admit it, or l'll search you.
There's no third way.

1321
01:24:16,363 --> 01:24:17,955
l believe you would. l really do.

1322
01:24:18,032 --> 01:24:20,057
You're a character,
if you don't mind my saying so.

1323
01:24:20,134 --> 01:24:21,396
You palmed it.

1324
01:24:22,169 --> 01:24:23,830
Yes, sir, that l did.

1325
01:24:28,776 --> 01:24:31,074
l must have my little joke now and then.

1326
01:24:31,145 --> 01:24:34,205
l was curious to know what you'd do
in a situation like this.

1327
01:24:34,281 --> 01:24:36,647
l must say you passed the test
with flying colors.

1328
01:24:36,717 --> 01:24:39,151
That's something l'd expect
from someone Wilmer's age.

1329
01:24:39,219 --> 01:24:41,983
This will soon be yours.
You might as well take it.

1330
01:24:42,056 --> 01:24:43,751
l ought to have more than $10,000.

1331
01:24:43,824 --> 01:24:46,156
You understand this is the first payment.
Later.

1332
01:24:46,226 --> 01:24:48,922
Oh, yes. Later you'll give me millions,
but...

1333
01:24:49,029 --> 01:24:50,758
...how's about $15,000 now?

1334
01:24:51,231 --> 01:24:54,598
Frankly and candidly,
upon my word of honor as a gentleman...

1335
01:24:55,102 --> 01:24:57,502
...$10,000 is all the money l can raise.

1336
01:24:58,939 --> 01:25:00,873
But you didn't say positively.

1337
01:25:01,275 --> 01:25:02,367
Positively.

1338
01:25:07,848 --> 01:25:10,146
l'd like to give you a word of advice.

1339
01:25:10,217 --> 01:25:11,241
Go ahead.

1340
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:14,378
You'll give her some money...

1341
01:25:14,455 --> 01:25:19,051
...but if you don't give her what she thinks
she should have, be careful.

1342
01:25:22,863 --> 01:25:23,955
Dangerous?

1343
01:25:24,865 --> 01:25:25,832
Very.

1344
01:25:27,134 --> 01:25:30,103
-How's the coffee coming, angel?
-ln a few minutes.

1345
01:25:30,170 --> 01:25:32,195
lt's almost daylight, Mr. Spade.

1346
01:25:32,806 --> 01:25:34,706
Can you start getting it now?

1347
01:25:35,142 --> 01:25:36,268
l guess so.

1348
01:25:49,623 --> 01:25:50,590
Hello.

1349
01:25:51,225 --> 01:25:54,092
Hello, precious.
l'm sorry to get you up so early.

1350
01:25:54,528 --> 01:25:56,826
Now, listen carefully. Here's the plot:

1351
01:25:56,897 --> 01:26:00,890
ln the Holland box, at the post office
there's an envelope with my scrawl.

1352
01:26:01,335 --> 01:26:05,567
ln that envelope, there's a parcel-room
check for the bundle we got yesterday.

1353
01:26:06,473 --> 01:26:09,203
Now, get that bundle
and bring it here, p.d.q.

1354
01:26:09,543 --> 01:26:12,376
That's a good girl. Now, hustle. Good-bye.

1355
01:27:02,096 --> 01:27:04,360
Thanks, lady.
Sorry to spoil your day of rest.

1356
01:27:04,431 --> 01:27:06,592
Not the first one you've spoiled.
Anything else?

1357
01:27:06,667 --> 01:27:07,759
No. No, thanks.

1358
01:27:07,835 --> 01:27:09,268
Bye-bye, then.

1359
01:27:28,856 --> 01:27:30,118
There you are.

1360
01:27:42,069 --> 01:27:44,503
Now, after 1 7 years!

1361
01:28:23,377 --> 01:28:24,366
lt is it.

1362
01:28:26,079 --> 01:28:27,569
But we'll make sure.

1363
01:28:45,399 --> 01:28:46,388
Fake.

1364
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:48,625
lt's a phony! lt's lead!

1365
01:28:49,136 --> 01:28:50,228
lt's lead!

1366
01:28:50,804 --> 01:28:51,964
lt's a fake!

1367
01:28:53,173 --> 01:28:55,607
You've had your little joke.
Now, tell us about it.

1368
01:28:55,676 --> 01:28:57,075
No, Sam! No!

1369
01:28:57,511 --> 01:28:59,809
That's the one l got from Kemidov.
l swear it!

1370
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:00,869
You.

1371
01:29:02,316 --> 01:29:04,045
lt's you who bungled it.

1372
01:29:04,985 --> 01:29:07,545
You and your stupid attempt to buy it!

1373
01:29:08,155 --> 01:29:10,749
Kemidov found out how valuable it was!

1374
01:29:11,325 --> 01:29:13,623
No wonder we had
such an easy time stealing it!

1375
01:29:13,694 --> 01:29:15,184
You...you imbecile!

1376
01:29:15,262 --> 01:29:16,923
You bloated idiot!

1377
01:29:17,564 --> 01:29:19,464
You stupid fat-head, you!

1378
01:29:47,995 --> 01:29:51,021
Yes, it's the Russian's hand.
There's no doubt about it.

1379
01:29:51,098 --> 01:29:52,395
What do you suggest...

1380
01:29:52,466 --> 01:29:55,230
...we stand here, shed tears
and call each other names...

1381
01:29:55,302 --> 01:29:57,202
...or shall we go to lstanbul?

1382
01:29:58,839 --> 01:30:00,272
Are you going?

1383
01:30:00,674 --> 01:30:04,542
Seventeen years l've wanted that item,
and have been trying to get it.

1384
01:30:04,611 --> 01:30:07,205
lf we must spend another year
on the quest...

1385
01:30:07,381 --> 01:30:11,283
...well, sir, it will be an additional
expenditure in time of only...

1386
01:30:12,219 --> 01:30:14,687
...five and fifteen-seventeenths percent.

1387
01:30:15,022 --> 01:30:16,717
l'm going with you!

1388
01:30:33,140 --> 01:30:34,129
Wilmer!

1389
01:30:37,077 --> 01:30:38,704
A swell lot of thieves!

1390
01:30:38,779 --> 01:30:41,942
We've little to boast about,
but the world hasn't come to an end...

1391
01:30:42,015 --> 01:30:44,006
...just because we've run into a setback.

1392
01:30:44,084 --> 01:30:47,485
-l must ask for that envelope.
-l held up my end. You got your dingus.

1393
01:30:47,554 --> 01:30:49,852
lt's your hard luck
it wasn't what you wanted.

1394
01:30:49,923 --> 01:30:51,914
Now, come, sir, we've all failed...

1395
01:30:51,992 --> 01:30:55,985
...and there's no reason for expecting
any of us to bear the whole brunt.

1396
01:30:56,296 --> 01:30:59,026
ln short, sir, l must ask you for my $10,000.

1397
01:31:03,303 --> 01:31:05,794
This'll take care of my time and expenses.

1398
01:31:08,909 --> 01:31:10,877
Now, sir, we'll say goodbye to you...

1399
01:31:10,944 --> 01:31:14,402
...unless you care to undertake
the lstanbul expedition with us.

1400
01:31:14,481 --> 01:31:15,573
You don't?

1401
01:31:15,849 --> 01:31:18,249
Frankly, sir, l'd like to have you along.

1402
01:31:18,318 --> 01:31:20,946
You're a man of nice judgment
and many resources.

1403
01:31:21,021 --> 01:31:24,513
Since there's no alternative,
you'll manage the police without a fall guy.

1404
01:31:24,591 --> 01:31:25,785
l'll make out all right.

1405
01:31:25,859 --> 01:31:28,919
Well, sir, the shortest farewells
are the best. Adieu.

1406
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,800
And to you, Miss O'Shaughnessy,
l leave the rara avis on the table there...

1407
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:38,497
...as a little memento.

1408
01:31:58,859 --> 01:32:00,850
Hello. Sergeant Polhaus there?

1409
01:32:01,094 --> 01:32:03,392
Yeah. Put him on. This is Sam Spade.

1410
01:32:04,765 --> 01:32:07,996
Hello. Tom? Now, listen.
l've got something for you. Here it is:

1411
01:32:08,068 --> 01:32:11,162
Jacoby and Thursby were killed
by a kid named Wilmer Cook.

1412
01:32:11,238 --> 01:32:14,674
Yeah. He's about 20 years old, 5-foot-6,
wearing a gray overcoat.

1413
01:32:14,941 --> 01:32:17,136
He's working for a man named
Casper Gutman.

1414
01:32:17,210 --> 01:32:19,872
You can't miss Gutman.
He must weigh 300 pounds.

1415
01:32:19,946 --> 01:32:21,811
That fellow Cairo's in with him, too.

1416
01:32:21,882 --> 01:32:23,679
They just left for the Alexandria Hotel.

1417
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:26,082
You'll have to move fast.
They're blowing town.

1418
01:32:26,153 --> 01:32:28,280
Watch yourself when you go up
against the kid.

1419
01:32:28,355 --> 01:32:30,084
Yes, that's right. Very.

1420
01:32:30,157 --> 01:32:31,681
Well, good luck, Tom.

1421
01:32:31,825 --> 01:32:34,020
They'll talk when they're nailed about us.

1422
01:32:34,094 --> 01:32:37,552
We only have minutes to get set
for the police. Give me all of it fast!

1423
01:32:37,631 --> 01:32:40,361
When you first came to me,
why did you want Thursby shadowed?

1424
01:32:40,434 --> 01:32:42,629
l thought he betrayed me.
l wanted to find out.

1425
01:32:42,702 --> 01:32:45,830
A lie! You knew you had Thursby hooked!
You wanted to kill him...

1426
01:32:45,906 --> 01:32:50,240
...before Jacoby came with the loot so you
wouldn't have to split it with him. Right?

1427
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:53,279
lf he knew someone was following him,
he'd be frightened away.

1428
01:32:53,346 --> 01:32:56,042
Miles wasn't clumsy enough
to be spotted the first night.

1429
01:32:56,116 --> 01:32:58,482
You told Thursby he was being followed.

1430
01:33:00,987 --> 01:33:02,113
l told him.

1431
01:33:03,557 --> 01:33:04,683
l told him.

1432
01:33:05,959 --> 01:33:07,119
Yes, but please believe me.

1433
01:33:07,194 --> 01:33:09,560
l wouldn't have if l thought
Floyd would kill him.

1434
01:33:09,629 --> 01:33:12,097
lf you thought he wouldn't kill Miles,
you were right.

1435
01:33:12,165 --> 01:33:14,463
Miles hadn't many brains,
but too much experience...

1436
01:33:14,534 --> 01:33:17,196
...as a detective to be caught
by a man he was shadowing...

1437
01:33:17,270 --> 01:33:20,103
...up a blind alley with his gun
and his overcoat buttoned.

1438
01:33:20,173 --> 01:33:22,539
But he'd have gone up there with you,
angel.

1439
01:33:22,709 --> 01:33:24,802
He was just dumb enough for that.

1440
01:33:25,312 --> 01:33:28,247
He'd have looked you up and down,
licked his lips and gone...

1441
01:33:28,315 --> 01:33:30,146
...grinning from ear to ear.

1442
01:33:30,283 --> 01:33:32,717
You could have stood
as close to him as you liked...

1443
01:33:32,786 --> 01:33:35,311
...and shot him with a gun
you got from Thursby that night.

1444
01:33:35,388 --> 01:33:38,186
-Don't say that!
-The police'll be here any minute! Talk!

1445
01:33:38,258 --> 01:33:39,247
Why do you accuse me--

1446
01:33:39,326 --> 01:33:43,228
lt's not the time for that schoolgirl act!
We're both sitting under the gallows!

1447
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:44,854
Now, why did you shoot Miles?

1448
01:33:46,299 --> 01:33:49,063
l didn't mean to at first, really, l didn't.

1449
01:33:50,237 --> 01:33:53,138
But when l found out
that Floyd couldn't be frightened....

1450
01:33:53,206 --> 01:33:55,231
l can't look at you and tell you this!

1451
01:33:55,308 --> 01:33:58,334
You thought Thursby would tackle Miles
and one of them would go down.

1452
01:33:58,411 --> 01:34:00,106
lf Thursby was killed, you were rid of him.

1453
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:02,239
lf it was Miles, you'd see
that Thursby was caught.

1454
01:34:02,315 --> 01:34:03,612
-Right?
-Something like that.

1455
01:34:03,683 --> 01:34:05,548
When Thursby wouldn't tackle him...

1456
01:34:05,619 --> 01:34:07,849
...you borrowed his gun
and did it yourself, right?

1457
01:34:07,921 --> 01:34:10,185
When you heard Thursby was shot,
you knew Gutman was in town!

1458
01:34:10,257 --> 01:34:12,054
You knew you needed another protector...

1459
01:34:12,125 --> 01:34:15,288
...somebody to fill Thursby's boots,
so you came back to me.

1460
01:34:15,362 --> 01:34:18,195
Yes! Sweetheart, it wasn't only that!

1461
01:34:18,932 --> 01:34:21,162
l'd have come back to you sooner or later.

1462
01:34:21,234 --> 01:34:23,862
From the very first instant l saw you,
l knew.

1463
01:34:25,972 --> 01:34:30,375
Well, if you get a good break,
you'll be out of Tehachapi in 20 years...

1464
01:34:30,610 --> 01:34:32,805
...and you can come back to me then.

1465
01:34:33,213 --> 01:34:36,410
l hope they don't hang you, precious,
by that sweet neck.

1466
01:34:39,152 --> 01:34:42,087
-You're not--
-Yes, angel, l'm gonna send you over.

1467
01:34:42,155 --> 01:34:44,521
The chances are you'll get off with life.

1468
01:34:44,591 --> 01:34:47,151
lf you're a good girl,
you'll be out in 20 years.

1469
01:34:47,227 --> 01:34:48,922
l'll be waiting for you.

1470
01:34:48,995 --> 01:34:51,589
lf they hang you, l'll always remember you.

1471
01:34:54,267 --> 01:34:55,632
Don't, Sam!

1472
01:34:56,102 --> 01:34:57,933
Don't say that, even in fun!

1473
01:34:59,606 --> 01:35:02,871
l was frightened for a minute.
l really thought....

1474
01:35:03,376 --> 01:35:05,844
You do such wild and unpredictable things.

1475
01:35:05,912 --> 01:35:07,402
Now, don't be silly.

1476
01:35:07,747 --> 01:35:09,374
You're taking the fall.

1477
01:35:15,555 --> 01:35:17,489
You've been playing with me...

1478
01:35:18,024 --> 01:35:20,788
...just pretending you cared
to trap me like this.

1479
01:35:20,860 --> 01:35:22,487
You didn't care at all!

1480
01:35:23,496 --> 01:35:24,895
You don't love me!

1481
01:35:25,065 --> 01:35:26,930
l won't play the sap for you!

1482
01:35:27,033 --> 01:35:28,591
You know it's not like that!

1483
01:35:28,668 --> 01:35:31,796
You never played square with me
since l've known you!

1484
01:35:31,871 --> 01:35:35,398
You know in your heart that
in spite of anything l've done, l love you.

1485
01:35:35,475 --> 01:35:37,568
l don't care who loves who!
l won't play the sap!

1486
01:35:37,644 --> 01:35:41,102
l won't walk in Thursby's, and l don't know
how many others' footsteps!

1487
01:35:41,181 --> 01:35:43,809
You killed Miles
and you're going over for it.

1488
01:35:57,063 --> 01:35:59,054
How can you do this to me, Sam?

1489
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:03,296
Surely, Mr. Archer wasn't
as much to you as....

1490
01:36:16,316 --> 01:36:17,305
Listen.

1491
01:36:18,385 --> 01:36:20,012
This won't do any good.

1492
01:36:21,121 --> 01:36:24,579
You'll never understand me,
but l'll try once and then give it up.

1493
01:36:24,658 --> 01:36:27,923
When a man's partner is killed,
he's supposed to do something.

1494
01:36:27,994 --> 01:36:30,224
lt makes no difference
what you thought of him.

1495
01:36:30,297 --> 01:36:33,824
He was your partner, and you're supposed
to do something about it...

1496
01:36:34,267 --> 01:36:37,100
...and it happens we're
in the detective business.

1497
01:36:37,203 --> 01:36:40,331
Well, when one of your organization
gets killed, it's...

1498
01:36:40,707 --> 01:36:43,835
...it's bad business to let the killer
get away with it...

1499
01:36:43,910 --> 01:36:46,538
...bad all around,
bad for every detective everywhere.

1500
01:36:46,613 --> 01:36:50,481
You don't expect me to think that these
are sufficient reasons for sending me--

1501
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:53,075
Wait'll l'm through. Then, you can talk.

1502
01:36:53,153 --> 01:36:55,314
l've no earthly reason to think
l can trust you.

1503
01:36:55,388 --> 01:36:58,414
lf l do this and get away with it,
you'll have something on me...

1504
01:36:58,491 --> 01:37:00,721
...that you can use whenever you want to.

1505
01:37:00,794 --> 01:37:02,284
Since l've got something on you...

1506
01:37:02,362 --> 01:37:05,923
...l couldn't be sure that you wouldn't
put a hole in me someday.

1507
01:37:06,433 --> 01:37:08,128
All those are on one side.

1508
01:37:08,535 --> 01:37:11,902
Maybe some of them are unimportant.
l won't argue about that.

1509
01:37:12,872 --> 01:37:14,863
But look at the number of them.

1510
01:37:15,975 --> 01:37:17,806
What have we got on the other side?

1511
01:37:17,877 --> 01:37:21,677
All we've got is that maybe you love me
and maybe l love you.

1512
01:37:23,316 --> 01:37:25,511
You know whether you love me or not.

1513
01:37:27,454 --> 01:37:32,016
Maybe l do. l'll have some rotten nights
after l've sent you over, but that'll pass.

1514
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:39,225
lf all l've said doesn't mean anything
to you...

1515
01:37:39,299 --> 01:37:41,927
...then forget it and we'll make it just this:

1516
01:37:42,001 --> 01:37:45,562
l won't, because all of me wants to
regardless of consequences...

1517
01:37:45,805 --> 01:37:47,500
...and because you've counted on it...

1518
01:37:47,574 --> 01:37:50,065
...the same as you counted on it
with all the others.

1519
01:37:50,143 --> 01:37:53,579
Would you have done this if the falcon
were real and you got your money?

1520
01:37:53,646 --> 01:37:56,308
Don't be too sure l'm as crooked
as l'm supposed to be.

1521
01:37:56,383 --> 01:37:58,817
That sort of reputation might be
good business...

1522
01:37:58,885 --> 01:38:02,946
...bringing high-priced jobs and making it
easier to deal with the enemy...

1523
01:38:03,390 --> 01:38:08,225
...but a lot more money would have been
one more item on your side of the scales.

1524
01:38:08,294 --> 01:38:11,889
lf you'd loved me, you wouldn't have
needed any more on that side.

1525
01:38:23,910 --> 01:38:24,899
Come in.

1526
01:38:29,849 --> 01:38:31,646
Hello, Tom. Got 'em?

1527
01:38:31,818 --> 01:38:32,807
Got 'em.

1528
01:38:32,886 --> 01:38:36,253
Swell! Here's another one for you.
She killed Miles.

1529
01:38:37,190 --> 01:38:40,682
Oh, and l've got some exhibits:
the boys' guns, one of Cairo's...

1530
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:43,593
...and $1,000 bill l was supposed
to be bribed with...

1531
01:38:43,897 --> 01:38:47,264
...and this black statuette here
that all the fuss was about.

1532
01:38:48,034 --> 01:38:50,969
What's the matter with your playmate?
He looks brokenhearted.

1533
01:38:51,037 --> 01:38:53,528
l bet when he heard Gutman's story,
he thought he had me.

1534
01:38:53,606 --> 01:38:54,800
Cut it out, Sam.

1535
01:38:56,409 --> 01:38:59,037
Well, shall we be getting down to the Hall?

1536
01:39:10,390 --> 01:39:11,482
lt's heavy.

1537
01:39:12,358 --> 01:39:13,450
What is it?

1538
01:39:17,831 --> 01:39:21,028
The stuff that dreams are made of.
