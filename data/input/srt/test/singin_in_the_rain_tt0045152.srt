Yes, but you didn't
lose your job, and she did.

Why, that's wonderful!

We'll keep it secret

...just in case it doesn't come off.
I'm worried about Lina.

1108
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:06,262
She doesn't like Miss Selden.
There might be fireworks.

1109
01:12:06,472 --> 01:12:08,973
Lina won't even know she's on the lot.

Boys, this is great.

The Duelling Cavalier can be saved.

Now, let's see.

The Duelling Cavalier with music.

The title.

1115
01:12:19,276 --> 01:12:22,695
The title's not right.
We need a musical title. Cosmo?

1116

Hey! The Duelling Mammy.

That's it.
The Dancing Cavalier.

Thanks.

1124
01:12:51,308 --> 01:12:53,184
Now, what about the story?

1125
01:12:53,394 --> 01:12:56,312
We need modern musical numbers.

1126
01:13:00,401 --> 01:13:02,527
We throw a modern section into it.

1127
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:04,487
The hero's a hoofer on Broadway.

1128
01:13:04,697 --> 01:13:06,114
He sings and he dances.

1129
01:13:06,323 --> 01:13:09,033
One night, backstage, he's reading
The Tale of Two Cities.

1130
01:13:09,201 --> 01:13:10,535
A sandbag hits his head.

1131
01:13:10,744 --> 01:13:12,704
He dreams he's back
during the French Revolution.

1132
01:13:12,871 --> 01:13:15,373
This way, we get in
the modern dancing numbers.

1133
01:13:15,541 --> 01:13:17,834
But in the dream,
we can still use the costumes.

1134
01:13:18,043 --> 01:13:20,878
Sensational! Cosmo,
remind me to give you a raise.

-Oh, R.F.
-Yes?

01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:24,507

It's a new one.
It's for the modern part.

It's called "Broadway Melody."

1165
01:15:27,005 --> 01:15:30,133
It's the story of a young hoofer
who comes to New York.

1166
01:15:30,342 --> 01:15:32,510
First, we set the stage with a song.

01:31:10,448 --> 01:31:12,449
-They can't do that.
-It's already done.

1255
01:31:12,742 --> 01:31:14,993
There's a whole
publicity campaign planned.

1256
01:31:15,286 --> 01:31:16,703
Publicity?

1257
01:31:16,954 --> 01:31:18,789
They can't make a fool out of me.

1258
01:31:18,998 --> 01:31:21,625
They can't make a laughingstock
out of Lina Lamont.

1259
01:31:21,918 --> 01:31:24,795
What do they think I am,
dumb or something?

1260
01:31:25,088 --> 01:31:27,339
Why, I make more money...

1261
01:31:28,132 --> 01:31:30,008
...than Calvin Coolidge...

1262
01:31:30,259 --> 01:31:32,094
...put together!

1263
01:31:34,138 --> 01:31:38,850
ROD: "Monumental Pictures enthusiastic
over Lina's singing and dancing."

1264
01:31:39,102 --> 01:31:40,143
I never said that.

1265
01:31:40,311 --> 01:31:44,314
"Premiere tomorrow night to reveal
Lina Lamont, big musical talent."

1266
01:31:44,524 --> 01:31:47,651
You can't pull a switch like this
on the publicity department.

1267
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:49,986
We were prepared
for the Selden campaign.

1268
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:52,322
Now you do this.
At least keep us informed.

1269
01:31:52,490 --> 01:31:55,283
Wait a minute.
I don't know anything about this.

1270
01:31:55,493 --> 01:31:56,743
What are we gonna do?

1271
01:31:56,953 --> 01:31:57,953
LINA:
Nothing.

1272
01:31:58,955 --> 01:32:01,498
Absolutely nothing.

1273
01:32:01,791 --> 01:32:04,835
You wouldn't wanna call the papers
and say Lina Lamont.. .

1274
01:32:05,044 --> 01:32:07,337
...is a big fat liar.

1275
01:32:07,630 --> 01:32:09,172
Did you send this stuff out?

1276
01:32:09,465 --> 01:32:12,801
I gave an exclusive story
to every paper in town.

1277
01:32:13,010 --> 01:32:15,178
You'll never get away with it.
Call the papers.

1278
01:32:15,388 --> 01:32:17,180
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1279
01:32:17,390 --> 01:32:19,474
Don't tell me what to do, Lina.

1280
01:32:19,684 --> 01:32:23,186
What do you think I am,
dumb or something?

1281
01:32:23,396 --> 01:32:26,523
I had my lawyer go over my contract.

1282
01:32:26,774 --> 01:32:27,858
Contract?

1283
01:32:28,151 --> 01:32:30,694
And l control my publicity, not you.

1284
01:32:30,862 --> 01:32:32,070
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1285
01:32:32,238 --> 01:32:35,282
The studio is responsible
for every word printed about me.

1286
01:32:35,491 --> 01:32:38,577
If I don't like it, I can sue.

1287
01:32:38,870 --> 01:32:39,911
What?

1288
01:32:40,163 --> 01:32:42,372
I can sue.

1289
01:32:42,582 --> 01:32:45,542
If you tell the papers
about Kathy Selden...

1290
01:32:45,793 --> 01:32:50,505
...it would be "detrimental
and deleterious" to my career.

1291
01:32:51,174 --> 01:32:54,301
I could sue you for the whole studio.

1292
01:32:54,552 --> 01:32:56,803
-That's a lot of nonsense.
-Says so.

1293
01:32:57,054 --> 01:32:58,430
Right here.

1294
01:32:58,723 --> 01:33:03,226
Contract dated June 8, 1 925,
paragraph 34, subdivision letter A.

1295
01:33:03,394 --> 01:33:05,437
"The party of the first part--"

1296
01:33:05,688 --> 01:33:07,522
-That's me.
-You win, Lina.

1297
01:33:07,732 --> 01:33:10,358
We better take Kathy's
credit card off the screen.

1298
01:33:10,568 --> 01:33:11,902
All right, go ahead.

1299
01:33:12,111 --> 01:33:14,321
Let's just get
this premiere over with.

1300
01:33:14,572 --> 01:33:15,906
Satisfied?

1301
01:33:16,115 --> 01:33:18,617
There's just one little thing more.

1302
01:33:19,076 --> 01:33:23,121
You want me to change the name of
the studio to Lamont Pictures, Inc.?

1303
01:33:23,414 --> 01:33:25,373
R.F., you're cute.

1304
01:33:25,583 --> 01:33:27,417
Now, I was just thinking.

1305
01:33:27,627 --> 01:33:30,128
You've given her
a part in Zelda's picture. ..

1306
01:33:30,421 --> 01:33:32,923
...and you'll give her
a bigger one in the next.

1307
01:33:33,216 --> 01:33:34,716
So, what?

1308
01:33:34,926 --> 01:33:37,636
If she's done such a grand job
doubling for my voice. ..

1309
01:33:37,929 --> 01:33:41,223
...don't you think she ought to
go on doing just that?

1310
01:33:41,432 --> 01:33:43,725
-And nothing else.
-You're out of your mind.

1311
01:33:43,935 --> 01:33:46,978
I'm still more important
to the studio than she is.

1312
01:33:47,230 --> 01:33:48,980
I wouldn't do that to her
in a million years.

1313
01:33:49,232 --> 01:33:52,734
You'd take her career away.
People don't do things like that.

1314
01:33:52,944 --> 01:33:54,486
People?

1315
01:33:54,779 --> 01:33:56,613
I ain't people.

1316
01:33:56,906 --> 01:33:58,657
I am a... .

"A shimmering, glowing star
in the cinema firmament."

01:34:06,624 --> 01:34:08,458
It says so.. .

1319
01:34:08,793 --> 01:34:10,126
...right there.

1320
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:27,477
Oh, Pierre, Pierre, my darling.
At last, l've found you.

1321
01:34:27,645 --> 01:34:28,687
Oh, Pierre.

1322
01:34:28,938 --> 01:34:32,691
Pierre, you're hurt.
Speak to me, speak to me.

[SINGIN]
l'll kiss her with a sigh

Would you?

01:34:42,785 --> 01:34:46,621
And if the girl were l

1326

Would you?

Oh, Pierre, hold me
in your arms always.

1328
01:34:55,006 --> 01:34:56,298
Lockwood's a sensation.

1329
01:34:56,507 --> 01:35:00,176
Yes, but Lamont! What a voice!
Isn't she marvelous?

1330
01:35:00,469 --> 01:35:02,971
-It's going over wonderfully, isn't it?
-Yeah.

1331
01:35:03,180 --> 01:35:07,517
Our love will last
till the stars turn cold.

And would you dare to say

Let's do the same as they

[AUDIENCE APPLAUDS]

1337
01:35:52,855 --> 01:35:54,230
R.F., it's a real smash.

1338
01:35:54,398 --> 01:35:57,108
-Congratulations. We owe you a lot.
-Thank you.

1339
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:59,235
-Kathy, we made it!
-It's a miracle!

1340
01:35:59,528 --> 01:36:01,279
It's great, Don. Just great.

1341
01:36:01,530 --> 01:36:04,407
You were fabulous.
You sang as well as Kathy Selden.

1342
01:36:04,617 --> 01:36:07,577
And l'm gonna for a long time.

1343

What do you mean?

1344
01:36:08,996 --> 01:36:12,248
I mean she's gonna go
right on singing for me.

1345
01:36:12,541 --> 01:36:13,625
Listen, Lina.

1346
01:36:13,918 --> 01:36:17,587
I thought something was cooking
beneath those bleached curls.

1347
01:36:17,797 --> 01:36:20,924
Kathy has her own career.
She only did this for this picture.

1348
01:36:21,217 --> 01:36:22,592
That's what you think.

1349

Come on, come on.

01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:26,930
-Lina's getting carried away.
-Yeah, she is.

Listen, you boa constrictor.

1352

Don't get any fancy ideas
about the future. Tell her!

Never mind, R.F.!
Listen to that applause.

1354

Wait till the money rolls in.

1355

You won't give all that up because
a nobody don't wanna be my voice.

1356

She's got something.
It's a gold mine.

1357
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:44,906
Part of that choice is mine.

1358

And l just won't do it.

1359

You've got a five-year contract.
You'll do what R.F. says.

What's the matter?
Why don't you tell her off?

1361

I'm confused.
This thing is so big--

-They're tearing the house apart.
-Take a curtain call.

1363
01:36:58,671 --> 01:37:00,964
I once gave you a cigar.
Can I have it back?

1364
01:37:01,132 --> 01:37:04,467
Listen! I'm an avalanche!
Selden, you're stuck.

1365
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:07,971
If this happens, get a new boy.
I won't stand for it.

1366

Who needs you? They'd come to see me
if I played opposite a monkey!

Don's a smash too.

1368

I'll say a few words.
I'm still running the studio.

You're Mr. Producer,
always running things, running me.

From now on, as far as I'm concerned,
I'm running things.

-Lina Lamont Pictures, Inc., huh?
-Yeah.

-A speech?

Yeah, everybody's always making
speeches for me.

-Right.

Kathy will stand back of there and sing.

She'll be back of the curtain singing,
and I'll be in front.. ..
