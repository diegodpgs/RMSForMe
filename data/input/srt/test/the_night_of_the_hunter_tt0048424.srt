1
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,573
Now, you remember, children,
how I told you

2
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,011
about the good Lord going up into the
mountain and talking to the people?

3
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,298
And how he said: "Blessed are the pure
in heart, for they shall see God"?

4
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,371
And how he said
that King Solomon in all his glory

5
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:39,417
was not as beautiful as
the lilies of the field?

6
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:43,014
And I know you won't forget
"Judge not lest ye be judged",

7
00:01:43,139 --> 00:01:45,130
because I explained that to you.

8
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:47,449
And then the good Lord went on to say:

9
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:51,010
"Beware of false prophets

10
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:54,048
which come to you in sheep's clothing

11
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:56,972
but inwardly they are ravening wolves."

12
00:01:57,738 --> 00:02:00,047
"Ye shall know them by their fruits."

13
00:02:00,658 --> 00:02:02,649
5, 1 0, 1 5, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40,

14
00:02:03,058 --> 00:02:05,049
45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70,

15
00:02:05,338 --> 00:02:08,296
75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100!

16
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,449
Here I come, ready or not.

17
00:02:12,178 --> 00:02:14,169
What's wrong?

18
00:02:25,657 --> 00:02:28,330
"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit,

19
00:02:29,297 --> 00:02:32,494
neither can a corrupt tree
bring forth good fruit."

20
00:02:32,857 --> 00:02:36,327
"Wherefore by their fruits
ye shall know them."

21
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,407
Well now, what's it to be, Lord?

22
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:43,887
Another widow?

23
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:46,247
How many's it been? Six?

24
00:02:46,896 --> 00:02:48,887
Twelve?

25
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,327
I disremember.

26
00:02:54,576 --> 00:02:56,806
You say the word, Lord. I'm on my way.

27
00:03:05,175 --> 00:03:08,690
You always send me money
to go forth and preach your word.

28
00:03:10,455 --> 00:03:14,084
A widow with a little wad of bills
hid away in the sugar bowl.

29
00:03:24,494 --> 00:03:26,485
Lord, I am tired.

30
00:03:27,734 --> 00:03:30,567
Sometimes I wonder
if you really understand.

31
00:03:32,574 --> 00:03:36,362
Not that you mind the killings.
Your book is full of killings.

32
00:03:37,374 --> 00:03:39,604
But there are things you do hate, Lord.

33
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:41,685
Perfume-smelling things.

34
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:45,363
Lacy things. Things with curly hair.

35
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:29,602
There are too many of them.

36
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:31,882
You can't kill a world.

37
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:36,648
You driving a touring car
with a Moundsville licence?

38
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:39,199
Harry Powell,
for the theft of that touring car

39
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:42,283
you'll spend 30 days
in the Moundsville Penitentiary.

40
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:46,330
- Preacher Harry Powell.
- A car thief. Picked up where you were.

41
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:49,922
A man of God? Harry Powell...

42
00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:13,521
Hold Miss Jenny still.

43
00:05:13,609 --> 00:05:15,600
Stand still, Miss Jenny.

44
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:19,839
There. What's so hard about that?

45
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:26,640
Daddy!

46
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:34,038
- Where's your mom?
- Out shopping.

47
00:05:34,488 --> 00:05:35,637
You're bleeding, Dad.

48
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:40,358
Listen. We have to hide this money before
they get to me. There's close to $10,000.

49
00:05:40,448 --> 00:05:43,281
Where? Under a rock
in the smokehouse? No, no.

50
00:05:43,808 --> 00:05:47,687
Under the bricks in the grape arbour.
No, no. They'd dig for it.

51
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,039
Sure. That's the place.

52
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:58,238
- That's him.
- He probably still has that gun.

53
00:05:58,607 --> 00:06:01,804
Listen to me, son. You've got to swear.
Swear means promise.

54
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:05,004
First swear you'll take care of little Pearl.
Guard her with your life, boy.

55
00:06:05,087 --> 00:06:07,681
Then swear you won't never tell where
the money's hid. Not even your mom.

56
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,086
- Yes, Dad.
- You understand?

57
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:11,806
- Not even her?
- You've got common sense, she ain't.

58
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:13,843
When you grow up
that money'll belong to you.

59
00:06:13,927 --> 00:06:16,565
Now stand up straight.
Raise your right hand.

60
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:20,878
- Now swear. I'll guard Pearl with my life.
- I will guard Pearl with my life.

61
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:25,881
- And I won't never tell about the money.
- And I won't never tell about the money.

62
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,157
You, Pearl. You swear too.

63
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,157
Ben Harper.

64
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:36,126
I'm going now, children. Goodbye.

65
00:06:36,206 --> 00:06:38,400
Drop that gun, Harper.
We don't want the kids hurt.

66
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:40,999
Just mind what you swore, son.
Mind, boy.

67
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,396
Don't.

68
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:48,756
Don't!

69
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,116
Dad.

70
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,237
Ben Harper, it is the sentence of this court

71
00:07:14,844 --> 00:07:17,677
that for the murder of Ed Smiley
and Corey South

72
00:07:17,764 --> 00:07:20,437
you be hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

73
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:22,634
May God have mercy on your soul.

74
00:07:31,523 --> 00:07:33,514
I got you all buffaloed.

75
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:36,917
You ain't none of you
gonna get it out of me.

76
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:39,394
Where, Ben? Where?

77
00:07:41,203 --> 00:07:42,079
Where?

78
00:07:42,163 --> 00:07:44,312
And a little child shall lead them.

79
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,913
Come on, boy. Tell me.

80
00:07:50,722 --> 00:07:53,520
Ben! I'm a man of God.

81
00:07:53,602 --> 00:07:56,514
- Making me talk about it in my sleep.
- No, Ben. No.

82
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:58,593
What did I say?

83
00:07:58,682 --> 00:08:00,434
You was quoting the scripture, Ben.

84
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,355
You said
"And a little child shall lead them."

85
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:12,952
You killed two men, Ben Harper.

86
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,555
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank

87
00:08:15,641 --> 00:08:20,761
cos I got tired of seeing children
roaming the woodlands without food.

88
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:25,190
Children roaming the highways
in this year of Depression.

89
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:28,710
Children sleeping in old abandoned
car bodies on junk heaps.

90
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,031
I promised myself I'd never see
the day when my young 'uns would want.

91
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,350
With that $10,000
I could build a tabernacle

92
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,671
and make that Wheeling lsland tabernacle
look like a chicken house.

93
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,910
Would you have free candy for the kids?

94
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,992
Think of it, Ben.
With that cursed, bloody gold.

95
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,758
How come you got that stick-knife
hid up in your blankets, Preacher?

96
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,388
The Lord blinded mine enemies when
they brought me in this evil place.

97
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:53,755
I smuggled it in right under
the noses of them guards.

98
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,830
"l come not with peace,

99
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,509
- but with a sword."
- You, Preacher?

100
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:04,507
The sword has served me through
many an evil time, Ben Harper.

101
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:10,552
What religion do you profess, Preacher?

102
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:14,597
The religion the Almighty and me
worked out betwixt us.

103
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:17,069
I'll bet!

104
00:09:19,198 --> 00:09:21,871
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.

105
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:24,234
Keep talking, Preacher.

106
00:09:24,318 --> 00:09:26,274
If you let that money serve the Lord,

107
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,077
- he might feel kindly towards you.
- Keep talking.

108
00:09:29,158 --> 00:09:33,275
Now, don't you think the Lord might
change his mind if you was to...

109
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:47,747
Lord, you sure knowed
what you was doing

110
00:09:48,277 --> 00:09:51,314
when you put me
in this very cell at this very time.

111
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:58,707
A man with $10,000 hid somewhere -
and a widow in the making.

112
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,348
- Any trouble?
- No.

113
00:10:16,435 --> 00:10:18,630
He was a cool one, that Harper.
Never broke.

114
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:20,706
Carried on some. Kicked.

115
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:24,032
- They say he left a wife and two kids.
- I never heard.

116
00:10:26,555 --> 00:10:28,591
- He never told about the money?
- No.

117
00:10:28,675 --> 00:10:30,745
What do you figure he done with it?

118
00:10:30,955 --> 00:10:33,788
He took the secret with him
when I dropped him.

119
00:10:36,674 --> 00:10:38,824
That you, Bart? Supper's waiting.

120
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:56,832
Mother, sometimes I think it might be
better if I was to quit my job as guard.

121
00:10:56,914 --> 00:11:01,464
You're always this way when there's a
hanging. You never have to be there.

122
00:11:03,473 --> 00:11:05,668
Sometimes I wish I was back in the mine.

123
00:11:05,753 --> 00:11:08,984
And leave me a widow after
another blast like the one in '24?

124
00:11:09,073 --> 00:11:11,064
Not on your life, old mister.

125
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:30,910
? Hing, hang, hung

126
00:11:30,992 --> 00:11:33,381
? See what the hangman done

127
00:11:37,592 --> 00:11:39,423
? See what the hangman done

128
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:41,423
? Hung, hang, hing

129
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:43,467
? See the robber swing

130
00:11:47,151 --> 00:11:48,584
? Hing, hang, hung

131
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:50,662
? Now my song is done

132
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,300
Are you going to buy it, John?

133
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,579
So your mommy's
keeping you out of school.

134
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,981
How is your poor, poor mother?

135
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,386
She's at Spoon's ice-cream parlour.

136
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:28,907
Did they ever find out what your father
done with all that money he stole?

137
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:32,420
Pearl and me, we have to go.

138
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:40,665
- You'd better not sing that song.
- Why?

139
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:42,740
Cos you're too little.

140
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,826
Can we get some candy?

141
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:50,019
No.

142
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:55,827
Willa Harper, there are certain
plain facts of life that adds up

143
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,786
just like two plus two makes four,
and one of them is this.

144
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:01,621
No woman is able to raise
growing youngsters alone.

145
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:06,498
- The Lord meant that job for two.
- lcey, I just don't want a husband.

146
00:13:14,347 --> 00:13:16,986
T'ain't a question of wanting
or not wanting.

147
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:18,500
You've got two little young 'uns.

148
00:13:18,587 --> 00:13:21,340
It's a man you need in the house,
Willa Harper.

149
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:36,097
Tell me a story, John.

150
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:40,739
Well, once upon a time...

151
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:46,102
there was a rich king
who had himself a son and a daughter.

152
00:13:48,306 --> 00:13:50,820
They all lived in a castle over in Africa.

153
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:58,977
Then one day this king
got taken away by some bad men.

154
00:13:59,465 --> 00:14:05,574
Before he got took off he told his son to
kill anyone who tried to steal his gold.

155
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:09,978
And before long,
the bad men came back and...

156
00:14:29,224 --> 00:14:31,215
Just a man.

157
00:14:31,464 --> 00:14:35,059
Good night, Pearl.
Sleep tight and don't let the bedbugs bite.

158
00:14:35,144 --> 00:14:38,055
Night, Miss Jenny.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

159
00:15:31,381 --> 00:15:36,171
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing
no more but she still blows as she passes.

160
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:42,330
Come on in and have a cup of coffee, boy.

161
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,651
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.

162
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,019
Ain't nobody going to neither,
as long as Uncle Birdie's round.

163
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,894
First day my joints is limber enough I'll
haul her out and give her a good caulking.

164
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,889
- Ain't seen you in a coon's age, boy.
- I've been minding Pearl.

165
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,814
Ain't it a caution what a woman'll load
onto a man's back when he ain't looking?

166
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:21,292
Excuse me, Cap, while l...
sweeten my coffee.

167
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:36,090
Dead and gone these twenty-five year
and never takes her eyes off me.

168
00:16:38,338 --> 00:16:42,650
Man of my years needs a little snort
in the morning to heat the boilers.

169
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:44,936
Yeah.

170
00:16:45,018 --> 00:16:49,647
I was talking to this stranger up at
the boarding house. He knowed your dad.

171
00:16:49,777 --> 00:16:51,972
- Where'd he know Dad?
- I'll not hide it.

172
00:16:52,057 --> 00:16:54,730
He knowed him
in the Moundsville Penitentiary.

173
00:16:54,817 --> 00:16:58,696
- I've got to go now, Uncle Birdie.
- Why, you just got here, boy.

174
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,531
I told Mom I'd be back
to Spoon's for Pearl.

175
00:17:24,616 --> 00:17:27,972
God works in a mysterious way
his wonders to perform.

176
00:17:28,736 --> 00:17:31,772
Yes, I was with Brother Harper
right up to the end.

177
00:17:32,255 --> 00:17:34,405
Now that I'm no longer employed by
the penitentiary

178
00:17:34,495 --> 00:17:37,089
it is my joy to bring this
small comfort to his loved ones.

179
00:17:37,175 --> 00:17:39,609
It's a mighty good man
would go out of his way

180
00:17:39,695 --> 00:17:42,368
to bring a word of cheer
to a grieving widow.

181
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:44,527
So you ain't with the state no more?

182
00:17:44,615 --> 00:17:46,571
No, brother, I resigned only yesterday.

183
00:17:46,655 --> 00:17:50,966
The heart-rending spectacle of them
poor men was just too much for me.

184
00:17:51,294 --> 00:17:53,683
Ah, little lad,
you're staring at my fingers.

185
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:57,528
Would you like me to tell you the little
story of Right-hand, Left-hand?

186
00:17:57,614 --> 00:17:59,605
The story of good and evil.

187
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,365
H-A-T-E.

188
00:18:02,454 --> 00:18:03,773
It was with this left hand

189
00:18:03,854 --> 00:18:07,130
that old Brother Cain struck
the blow that laid his brother low.

190
00:18:07,214 --> 00:18:09,205
L-O-V-E.

191
00:18:09,454 --> 00:18:13,924
See these fingers, dear hearts? They has
veins that run straight to the soul of man.

192
00:18:14,013 --> 00:18:16,607
The right hand, friends.
The hand of love.

193
00:18:16,893 --> 00:18:19,487
Now watch and
I'll show you the story of life.

194
00:18:19,573 --> 00:18:23,327
These fingers is always a-warring and
a-tugging, one agin t'other.

195
00:18:24,613 --> 00:18:26,604
Now watch 'em.

196
00:18:26,693 --> 00:18:28,524
Old Brother Left-hand.

197
00:18:28,613 --> 00:18:30,444
Left-hand hates a-fighting.

198
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:32,524
And it looks like Love's a goner.

199
00:18:32,893 --> 00:18:34,883
But wait a minute!

200
00:18:36,052 --> 00:18:38,168
Hot dog! Love's a-winning.

201
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:41,767
Yes, sirree. It's Love that won.

202
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:45,045
And old Left-hand Hate
is down for the count.

203
00:18:47,212 --> 00:18:49,203
I never heard it better told.

204
00:18:50,252 --> 00:18:53,847
I wish every soul in this community
could get the benefit.

205
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,810
You've just got to stay
for our picnic Sunday.

206
00:18:57,891 --> 00:19:01,008
No, I must wend my way downriver
on the Lord's business.

207
00:19:01,091 --> 00:19:03,605
You ain't leaving in no hurry
if we can help it.

208
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:05,488
John, mind your manners!

209
00:19:05,571 --> 00:19:07,960
Take that look off your face. Act nice.

210
00:19:08,331 --> 00:19:10,765
He don't mean no impudence,
do you, boy?

211
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:13,402
Do you, boy?

212
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:16,728
Many's the time poor Brother Ben
told me about these young 'uns.

213
00:19:16,811 --> 00:19:18,163
What did he tell you?

214
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,720
He told me what fine little lambs
you and your sister both was.

215
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,402
Is that all?

216
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,402
Why, no, boy.
He told me lots and lots of things.

217
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,281
- Nice things, boy.
- Thank you.

218
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,484
My, that fudge smells yummy.

219
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,447
It's for the picnic.

220
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:42,205
And you don't get a smidgen of my fudge
unless you stayfor the picnic.

221
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:27,561
Don't he have the grandest singing voice?

222
00:20:27,647 --> 00:20:30,161
John! Pearl!
Run along and play, you two.

223
00:20:30,527 --> 00:20:33,041
- Where?
- Down by the river. My goodness!

224
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:39,158
That fella's aching to settle down with
some nice woman and make a home.

225
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:42,035
Icey, it's awful soon after Ben's passing.

226
00:20:42,127 --> 00:20:44,197
If ever I saw a sign from heaven...

227
00:20:45,246 --> 00:20:48,158
- John don't like him much.
- Pearl dotes on him.

228
00:20:48,526 --> 00:20:50,437
The boy worries me.

229
00:20:50,526 --> 00:20:54,235
I know it's silly, but it's like there's
something still between him and his dad.

230
00:20:54,326 --> 00:20:56,317
What he needs is a dose of salts.

231
00:20:56,846 --> 00:20:59,155
- Oh, there's something else.
- What?

232
00:20:59,846 --> 00:21:00,676
The money.

233
00:21:00,766 --> 00:21:04,884
I declare, Willa Harper, you'll let
that money haunt you to your grave.

234
00:21:04,966 --> 00:21:06,637
Icey, I would love to be satisfied

235
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:09,478
that Harry Powell don't think
I got that money hid somewhere.

236
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:12,079
You come right out
and ask that man of God.

237
00:21:12,645 --> 00:21:16,558
Mr Powell! Clear that evil mud
out of your soul.

238
00:21:16,805 --> 00:21:20,434
John! Pearl!
Come along here and get some fudge.

239
00:21:20,525 --> 00:21:23,039
- I don't want no fudge.
- You do what you're told!

240
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,877
You go set down by the river.

241
00:21:24,965 --> 00:21:27,638
- Oh, lcey, I'm a sight.
- Get along with you!

242
00:21:33,004 --> 00:21:34,995
You...!

243
00:21:36,404 --> 00:21:41,558
That young lady better look sharp or
some smart sister is gonna snap him up.

244
00:21:41,644 --> 00:21:43,635
She's not the only fish in the river!

245
00:21:43,724 --> 00:21:46,716
Now you two stay put.
Shilly-shallying around.

246
00:21:47,004 --> 00:21:48,915
A husband's one piece of store goods
you never know

247
00:21:49,004 --> 00:21:51,358
till you get it home and take the paper off.

248
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:56,278
Did Ben Harper ever tell you what
he done with the money he stole?

249
00:21:56,363 --> 00:21:58,354
My dear child, don't you know?

250
00:22:00,243 --> 00:22:02,234
She's mooning about Ben Harper.

251
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:06,835
That wasn't love. That was just
flapdoodle. Have some fudge, lambs.

252
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,641
When you've been married
to a man 40 years,

253
00:22:08,723 --> 00:22:11,475
you know all that
don't amount to a hill of beans.

254
00:22:11,562 --> 00:22:15,271
I've been married to my Walt that long
and I swear, in all that time,

255
00:22:15,362 --> 00:22:18,035
I just lie there thinking about my canning.

256
00:22:21,282 --> 00:22:23,273
John!

257
00:22:34,281 --> 00:22:37,557
A woman's a fool to marry for that.
That's something for a man.

258
00:22:37,641 --> 00:22:42,351
The good Lord never meant for a decent
woman to want that. Not really want it.

259
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:44,831
It's all just a fake and a pipe dream.

260
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:49,999
John, Mr Powell has something to tell you.

261
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:54,557
Well, John.

262
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:59,031
The night before your father died he
told me what he did with that money.

263
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,634
That money's at the bottom of the river,
wrapped around a 1 2-pound cobblestone.

264
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,351
Thank you, Harry.

265
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,598
I feel clean now.

266
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,797
My whole body's just a-quivering
with cleanness.

267
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:22,588
John, come here. Your tie is crooked.

268
00:23:54,758 --> 00:23:58,034
- When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
- Can't hear you, boy.

269
00:24:06,797 --> 00:24:08,674
When'll the skiff be ready?

270
00:24:09,237 --> 00:24:11,592
Have her ready inside a week
and then we'll go fishing.

271
00:24:11,677 --> 00:24:15,067
- How's your ma?
- Oh, she's all right.

272
00:24:15,157 --> 00:24:17,113
- How's sister Pearl?
- Just fine.

273
00:24:17,197 --> 00:24:20,109
- You leaving, boy?
- Got to watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.

274
00:24:20,197 --> 00:24:22,869
Well, good night, boy.
Come again any time.

275
00:24:23,956 --> 00:24:27,995
And mind, boy, I'll have your
pa's skiff shipshape inside a week.

276
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:58,186
Somebody there?

277
00:25:07,794 --> 00:25:09,785
Anybody there?

278
00:25:12,914 --> 00:25:14,745
Anybody here?

279
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:16,825
Good evening, John.

280
00:25:18,874 --> 00:25:21,627
I had a little talk with
your mother tonight, John.

281
00:25:21,714 --> 00:25:26,026
And your mother decided it might be best
for me to let you know the news.

282
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:31,345
Your mother told me she wanted me to
be a daddy to you and your sister.

283
00:25:31,433 --> 00:25:33,424
We're going to get married, boy.

284
00:25:35,193 --> 00:25:37,184
Did you hear what I said, boy?

285
00:25:38,273 --> 00:25:41,265
Married. We're going to
Sisterville tomorrow.

286
00:25:42,273 --> 00:25:44,867
- And when we get back...
- You ain't my dad.

287
00:25:45,153 --> 00:25:46,791
You'll never be my dad.

288
00:25:46,873 --> 00:25:49,909
When we get back
we're all going to be friends

289
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:53,022
and share our fortunes together, John.

290
00:25:53,112 --> 00:25:56,229
You think you can make me tell,
but I won't. I won't!

291
00:25:59,352 --> 00:26:02,344
- Tell me what, boy?
- Nothing.

292
00:26:03,432 --> 00:26:05,900
We're not keeping secrets
from each other, are we?

293
00:26:06,392 --> 00:26:08,383
No.

294
00:26:09,872 --> 00:26:11,862
Well, no matter.

295
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:14,461
We've got a long time together, boy.

296
00:26:21,271 --> 00:26:23,660
Wave your hands! Great sakes!

297
00:26:24,431 --> 00:26:27,343
Now you wait here
while I get your night things.

298
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,141
Now can I tell?

299
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,822
When Mr Powell's our daddy
then can I tell him about it?

300
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,707
- You swore, Pearl.
- John, don't.

301
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,099
You promised Dad you wouldn't tell.

302
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,420
I love Mr Powell lots and lots, John.

303
00:27:14,949 --> 00:27:16,939
Men!

304
00:27:28,868 --> 00:27:30,859
Harry?

305
00:27:32,788 --> 00:27:34,779
Fix that window shade.

306
00:27:45,427 --> 00:27:47,418
I was praying.

307
00:27:48,307 --> 00:27:52,505
I'm sorry. I didn't know. I thought...

308
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:55,181
You thought, Willa,
that the moment you walked in that door

309
00:27:55,267 --> 00:27:58,304
I'd start to pawing you
in that abominable way

310
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:01,503
that men are supposed to do
on their wedding night.

311
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:03,657
- Ain't that right, now?
- No.

312
00:28:05,026 --> 00:28:07,984
I think it's time we made one thing
perfectly clear, Willa.

313
00:28:08,066 --> 00:28:12,696
Marriage to me represents a blending of
two spirits in the sight of heaven.

314
00:28:23,945 --> 00:28:25,936
Get up, Willa.

315
00:28:27,825 --> 00:28:29,816
- Harry, what...
- Get up.

316
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:36,057
Now, go look at yourself yonder
in that mirror.

317
00:28:37,825 --> 00:28:39,816
Do as I say.

318
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:54,015
Look at yourself.

319
00:28:56,104 --> 00:28:58,095
What do you see, girl?

320
00:28:58,744 --> 00:29:00,735
You see the body of a woman.

321
00:29:00,944 --> 00:29:03,378
The temple of creation and motherhood.

322
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:07,298
You see the flesh of Eve
that man since Adam has profaned.

323
00:29:07,703 --> 00:29:09,853
That body was meant
for begetting children.

324
00:29:09,943 --> 00:29:12,093
It was not meant for the lust of men.

325
00:29:14,703 --> 00:29:16,659
Do you want more children, Willa?

326
00:29:16,743 --> 00:29:18,381
I...

327
00:29:18,463 --> 00:29:19,862
No.

328
00:29:19,943 --> 00:29:23,094
It's the business of this marriage
to mind those two you have now,

329
00:29:23,183 --> 00:29:25,139
not to beget more.

330
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:27,213
Yes.

331
00:29:33,862 --> 00:29:37,059
All right. You can get in bed now
and stop shivering.

332
00:29:39,542 --> 00:29:44,218
Help me to get clean, so I can be
what Harry wants me to be.

333
00:29:51,861 --> 00:29:56,252
Meanest, orneriest, sneakiest critter
in the whole river, boy. A gar.

334
00:29:57,541 --> 00:30:00,453
- Here are your hooks, Uncle Birdie.
- Pshaw, boy!

335
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:03,294
Ain't a hook in the land
strong enough to land Mr Gar.

336
00:30:03,981 --> 00:30:07,417
What a fella needs is mother wit -
and a horse hair.

337
00:30:08,261 --> 00:30:10,410
Golly! Won't it bust it, Uncle Birdie?

338
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,934
No, horse hair'll hold a lumpin' whale!

339
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,771
- You mind my cussin', boy?
- No.

340
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,657
Well, the reason I ask,
your step-pa bein' a preacher an' all...

341
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,172
Never was much of a one
for preachers my own self.

342
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,056
I don't know what's wrong
up at your house,

343
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,415
but always remember, Cap,
if you're ever in trouble,

344
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:36,334
holler and come a-runnin'.
Uncle Birdie's your friend.

345
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:46,489
There! You slimy, snag-toothed,
bait-stealin' so-and-so!

346
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:49,250
Amen.

347
00:30:49,339 --> 00:30:51,330
- You have all sinned.
- Yes!

348
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:55,129
But which one of you can say,
as I can say,

349
00:30:56,058 --> 00:30:58,208
that you drove a good man to murder?

350
00:30:58,658 --> 00:31:04,096
Because I kept a-houndin' him for
perfume and clothes and face paint!

351
00:31:04,858 --> 00:31:08,294
And... he slew two human beings!

352
00:31:08,938 --> 00:31:11,406
And he come to me and he said

353
00:31:11,498 --> 00:31:16,013
"Take this money and buy yourself
the clothes and the paint."

354
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:19,368
But brethren...

355
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:22,646
Oh, that's where the Lord stepped in!

356
00:31:25,297 --> 00:31:26,366
Yes!

357
00:31:26,457 --> 00:31:28,254
Alleluia!

358
00:31:28,577 --> 00:31:30,852
He said, the Lord, to that man

359
00:31:31,457 --> 00:31:36,132
"You take that money
and you throw it in the river!"

360
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:39,567
- In the river!
- In the river!

361
00:32:01,735 --> 00:32:04,249
Now, you're John and you're Pearl.

362
00:32:06,495 --> 00:32:09,931
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a sin.

363
00:32:10,615 --> 00:32:12,606
I didn't tell no one.

364
00:32:17,415 --> 00:32:19,803
It's all here.

365
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,812
John?

366
00:32:37,894 --> 00:32:38,724
Yes?

367
00:32:38,814 --> 00:32:41,646
- What are you doin', boy?
- Gettin' Pearl to bed.

368
00:32:41,733 --> 00:32:44,645
- What's takin' you so long about it?
- Nothing.

369
00:32:50,453 --> 00:32:52,409
What's that you're playin' with?

370
00:32:52,493 --> 00:32:53,812
Pearl's junk.

371
00:32:53,893 --> 00:32:56,965
Mom gets mad when she plays out here
and don't put it away.

372
00:32:57,053 --> 00:32:59,044
Come on, children.

373
00:33:02,293 --> 00:33:04,283
Off to bed with the both of you.

374
00:33:10,652 --> 00:33:12,643
Come here, John.

375
00:33:15,492 --> 00:33:17,881
Your mother tells me you tattled on me.

376
00:33:18,092 --> 00:33:21,368
She said you told her
I asked where that money was hid.

377
00:33:23,052 --> 00:33:25,849
That wasn't very nice, boy. Have a heart.

378
00:33:26,731 --> 00:33:28,722
Yeah!

379
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:32,407
Well, it doesn't matter.
It's your word against mine.

380
00:33:32,771 --> 00:33:34,648
It's me your mother believes.

381
00:33:39,971 --> 00:33:42,644
Were you impudent again
to Mr Powell, John?

382
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,762
Mom, I didn't mean it.

383
00:33:46,051 --> 00:33:48,041
What were you impudent about?

384
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,999
He asked me about
the money again, Mom.

385
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,800
John, you always make up that lie.

386
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:57,879
There is no money. Why can't you
get that through your head?

387
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:01,564
The boy's as stubborn
and as mulish as a sheep.

388
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,003
It's a shame.

389
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,808
- Good night, lcey.
- Good night, honey.

390
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:07,120
Good night, Walt.

391
00:34:09,209 --> 00:34:11,200
Plan on a longer visit next time.

392
00:34:11,729 --> 00:34:14,163
You hardly settle before
you're frettin' to get home.

393
00:34:14,249 --> 00:34:16,809
I'm needed to keep peace
and harmony betwixt them.

394
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,323
It's my burden and I'm proud of it, lcey.

395
00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:32,558
- Where's the money hid?
- I don't know.

396
00:34:32,648 --> 00:34:35,560
She thinks that money's
at the bottom of the river.

397
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,843
But you and me,
we know better, don't we?

398
00:34:37,928 --> 00:34:39,919
I don't know nothin'.

399
00:34:40,448 --> 00:34:43,360
Well, never mind, boy.
The summer's young yet.

400
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:46,840
Pearl. Come here.

401
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:53,165
John's a fella likes to keep secrets.
I'll tell you a secret.

402
00:34:53,247 --> 00:34:56,239
- Yes?
- I knowed your daddy.

403
00:34:57,647 --> 00:34:59,877
And you know what your daddy told me?

404
00:35:00,407 --> 00:35:04,798
He said "You tell my little girl Pearl there's
to be no secrets between her and you."

405
00:35:04,887 --> 00:35:06,605
Yes?

406
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,678
All right. Now it's your turn.

407
00:35:09,087 --> 00:35:11,078
What secret shall I tell?

408
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:14,317
What's your name?

409
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:16,795
You're just fooling. My name's Pearl!

410
00:35:19,126 --> 00:35:21,435
Well, I reckon I'll have to try again.

411
00:35:22,126 --> 00:35:24,117
Where's the money hid?

412
00:35:25,966 --> 00:35:28,878
Pearl! You swore you wouldn't tell!
You swore!

413
00:35:29,406 --> 00:35:31,476
You hit Daddy with the hairbrush.

414
00:35:34,126 --> 00:35:37,322
Now, you see?
We can't have anything to do with John.

415
00:35:37,525 --> 00:35:40,358
You and me'll go on down
to the parlour, Pearl.

416
00:35:57,084 --> 00:35:59,882
John's just plumb bad
through and through.

417
00:35:59,964 --> 00:36:02,956
- John's bad.
- Yes, John's bad.

418
00:36:03,924 --> 00:36:08,156
- Tell me another secret about my dad.
- Oh, no! Your turn.

419
00:36:08,244 --> 00:36:10,474
All right. What secret shall I tell?

420
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:14,713
- Where's the money hid?
- John's bad.

421
00:36:15,244 --> 00:36:17,235
Where's the money hid?

422
00:36:17,524 --> 00:36:20,515
Tell me, you little wretch,
or I'll tear your arm off!

423
00:36:32,563 --> 00:36:35,600
- lcey, I'm worried about Willa.
- How do you mean?

424
00:36:35,883 --> 00:36:38,477
I'm figurin' how to say it
so as you won't get mad.

425
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,518
Say what, Walt Spoon?

426
00:36:40,602 --> 00:36:42,797
- Somethin's wrong about it.
- About what?

427
00:36:42,882 --> 00:36:45,271
- About Mr Powell. All of it.
- Walt...!

428
00:36:45,962 --> 00:36:50,752
- A body's got a right to their feelings.
- May the Lord have mercy on you.

429
00:36:51,082 --> 00:36:52,197
I was just...

430
00:36:56,162 --> 00:36:58,153
Amen.

431
00:36:59,322 --> 00:37:01,313
Are you through praying?

432
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:03,672
I'm through, Harry.

433
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:06,235
You were listening
outside the parlour window.

434
00:37:06,321 --> 00:37:09,313
- It ain't in the river, is it, Harry?
- Answer me.

435
00:37:09,841 --> 00:37:13,038
Ben never told you he throwed it
in the river, did he?

436
00:37:23,081 --> 00:37:27,437
The children know where it's hid.
John knows. Is that it, Harry?

437
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,196
Then it's still here amongst us.
Tainting us.

438
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,433
You must have known about it
all along, Harry.

439
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,712
But that ain't the reason
why you married me.

440
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:49,430
I know that much.

441
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:53,353
Because the Lord just wouldn't let it be.

442
00:37:54,759 --> 00:38:00,231
He made you marry me so you could
show me the Way and the Life.

443
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,830
And the salvation of my soul.

444
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:07,989
Ain't that so, Harry?

445
00:38:08,518 --> 00:38:11,635
So you might say that it was the money
that brung us together.

446
00:38:13,798 --> 00:38:15,789
The rest of it don't matter.

447
00:39:11,036 --> 00:39:13,026
Walt. Come quick.

448
00:39:13,195 --> 00:39:15,231
- What's wrong, Mother?
- Shhh! He's in there.

449
00:39:15,315 --> 00:39:19,149
- Who?
- Mr Powell. Willa has run away.

450
00:39:19,555 --> 00:39:23,434
- I'll be switched! Just went?
- She took out in that old Model T.

451
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:26,105
- Is he hit pretty bad?
- All to pieces.

452
00:39:26,195 --> 00:39:28,265
Well, there's a little
peach brandy in here...

453
00:39:28,355 --> 00:39:31,267
- A man of the cloth?
- Well, just a sip.

454
00:39:32,155 --> 00:39:34,987
Walt Spoon, that's for sickness
in the house!

455
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:39,225
- Well, what can we do?
- If you talked to him, another man...

456
00:39:39,314 --> 00:39:42,112
Now, Mother, please. I'm no good at...

457
00:39:45,034 --> 00:39:46,103
Mr Powell?

458
00:39:46,194 --> 00:39:48,754
- A strange woman is a narrow pit.
- Amen.

459
00:39:48,834 --> 00:39:53,385
She lieth in wait as for prey and
increaseth the transgressors among men.

460
00:39:54,074 --> 00:39:56,792
Oh, my dear friends.
Whatever would I do without you?

461
00:39:56,873 --> 00:40:00,104
- Mr Powell!
- Well, if there's anythin' we can...

462
00:40:00,193 --> 00:40:03,549
No, it's my shame. It's my crown
of thorns. I must wear it bravely.

463
00:40:03,633 --> 00:40:06,545
- What could have possessed that girl?
- Satan.

464
00:40:07,433 --> 00:40:09,230
Didn't you have no inklin'?

465
00:40:09,313 --> 00:40:11,622
Yes, I did. From the very first night.

466
00:40:12,073 --> 00:40:14,064
- First night?
- Our honeymoon.

467
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:16,824
How's that?

468
00:40:16,992 --> 00:40:20,064
- She turned me out of the bed.
- No!

469
00:40:21,872 --> 00:40:23,544
Well, what do you figure to do?

470
00:40:23,632 --> 00:40:27,068
Do? Why, just stay right here
and take care of them kids.

471
00:40:27,712 --> 00:40:32,263
Maybe it was never meant for a woman
like Willa to taint their young lives.

472
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,150
It's mighty brave of you.

473
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:37,588
I reckon it was just ordained that way,
Brother Spoon.

474
00:40:38,112 --> 00:40:40,341
Didn't she leave no word?

475
00:40:41,391 --> 00:40:44,383
A scrawl. On a notepaper on the bureau.

476
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,142
I burned it.

477
00:40:47,471 --> 00:40:50,508
Tore it up and burned it,
it stank so strong of hellfire.

478
00:40:50,591 --> 00:40:52,388
Amen!

479
00:40:52,471 --> 00:40:55,429
The pitcher has went to the well
once too often, friends.

480
00:40:55,511 --> 00:40:58,105
Oh, she'll come
draggin' her tail back home.

481
00:40:58,191 --> 00:41:01,819
She'll not be back.
I reckon I'm safe in promisin' you that.

482
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,066
- Maybe she's just on a spree.
- Oh, no.

483
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:08,389
- Well, there's no harm in hopin'.
- Ain't no sense in it neither.

484
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,668
I figured somethin' was brewin'
when she went to bed last night.

485
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,741
How?

486
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:17,103
Well, she tarried around
in the kitchen after I'd gone up.

487
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:20,307
And when I went downstairs
to see what was wrong...

488
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,977
Well, she'd found
this jar of dandelion wine

489
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:28,348
that the husband, this Harper,
had hid somewheres in the cellar.

490
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:30,900
She was drinkin'.

491
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:33,548
I tried to save her.

492
00:41:33,629 --> 00:41:37,224
I know you did, Mr Powell.
Oh, I know how hard you tried.

493
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:39,300
But the devil wins sometimes.

494
00:41:40,069 --> 00:41:42,981
Can't nobody say
I didn't do my best to save her.

495
00:43:02,385 --> 00:43:03,943
Children!

496
00:43:19,024 --> 00:43:21,015
Pearl?

497
00:43:23,384 --> 00:43:25,375
Careful.

498
00:43:26,264 --> 00:43:28,255
Why do we have to hide, John?

499
00:43:31,344 --> 00:43:32,617
Where's Mom?

500
00:43:32,703 --> 00:43:35,058
- She's gone to Moundsville.
- To see Dad?

501
00:43:35,143 --> 00:43:37,134
Yes, I reckon that's it.

502
00:43:44,423 --> 00:43:47,415
Now, listen to me, Pearl.
You and me is runnin' off tonight.

503
00:43:47,503 --> 00:43:49,221
Why?

504
00:43:49,303 --> 00:43:51,942
If we stay here
somethin' awfuI'll happen to us.

505
00:43:52,023 --> 00:43:54,172
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?

506
00:43:54,302 --> 00:43:57,339
No. That's just it. No.

507
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:08,498
- Where we going, John?
- Somewheres. I don't know yet.

508
00:44:09,302 --> 00:44:10,735
I'm hungry, John.

509
00:44:10,822 --> 00:44:13,814
- We'll steal somethin' to eat.
- lt'll spoil our suppers.

510
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:15,892
Pearl?

511
00:44:20,101 --> 00:44:22,979
I can hear you whisperin', children,
so I know you're down there.

512
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:25,291
I can feel myself gettin' awful mad.

513
00:44:29,101 --> 00:44:32,696
I'm out of patience, children.
I'm coming to find you now.

514
00:44:34,661 --> 00:44:36,652
Mr Powell!

515
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,691
Well, well, Mrs Spoon.

516
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,368
- Where are the children?
- Down there in that cellar playin' games.

517
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,451
And they won't mind me when I call them.

518
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,531
I'm at my wit's end, Mrs Spoon.

519
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,771
John? Pearl?

520
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:03,290
Shake a leg!

521
00:45:08,859 --> 00:45:11,532
Well, well, well! What's that?

522
00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:14,816
Just a little hot supper
I fixed for you and the children.

523
00:45:14,899 --> 00:45:17,288
It seemed the least we could do.

524
00:45:18,979 --> 00:45:21,367
I won't have you worryin'
poor Mr Powell another minute.

525
00:45:21,458 --> 00:45:24,370
Just look at you!
Dust and filth from top to toe.

526
00:45:24,578 --> 00:45:26,967
Want me to take 'em up
and wash 'em good?

527
00:45:27,098 --> 00:45:31,455
No. No, thank you, dear lcey.
I'll tend to them. Thank you.

528
00:45:31,578 --> 00:45:35,617
Don't be too hard on them, Preacher.
Poor, motherless children.

529
00:45:35,778 --> 00:45:39,214
Remember, now, Mr Powell.
Don't be afraid to call on us.

530
00:45:44,217 --> 00:45:45,935
Goodbye.

531
00:45:46,017 --> 00:45:48,406
Goodbye, Mrs Spoon. And thanks again.

532
00:45:56,497 --> 00:46:00,695
Now, weren't you afraid, little lambs?
Down there in all that dark?

533
00:46:16,256 --> 00:46:18,247
They'll think it was me.

534
00:46:18,736 --> 00:46:21,409
They'll think it was poor old Uncle Birdie.

535
00:46:24,416 --> 00:46:26,565
Oh, if you could have seen it, Bess.

536
00:46:28,295 --> 00:46:30,286
Down there in the deep place.

537
00:46:31,215 --> 00:46:36,972
With her hair wavin' soft and lazy
like meadow grass under flood water.

538
00:46:38,455 --> 00:46:42,892
And that slit in her throat
like she had an extra mouth.

539
00:46:47,215 --> 00:46:50,570
You're the only human mortal
I can go to, Bess.

540
00:46:51,854 --> 00:46:55,972
If I go to the law, they'll hang it on me.

541
00:47:02,134 --> 00:47:05,331
Sweet heaven, save poor old Uncle Birdie!

542
00:47:11,013 --> 00:47:13,368
- I'm hungry.
- Sure.

543
00:47:14,173 --> 00:47:18,564
And there's fried chicken, sweet
potatoes, corn bread and apple cobbler.

544
00:47:19,693 --> 00:47:22,366
- Can I have my supper, please?
- Naturally.

545
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:26,532
- Can I have milk too?
- Mm-hm. But first we'll have a little talk.

546
00:47:27,133 --> 00:47:29,124
- About our secrets.
- No.

547
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,972
- And why not, pray tell?
- Cos John said I mustn't.

548
00:47:32,052 --> 00:47:34,043
Never mind what John said!

549
00:47:35,012 --> 00:47:36,923
John's a meddler.

550
00:47:37,012 --> 00:47:39,003
Now stop that snivellin'.

551
00:47:39,212 --> 00:47:41,282
Looky here. You know what that is?

552
00:47:42,172 --> 00:47:44,561
Want to see somethin' cute? Now looky.

553
00:47:46,732 --> 00:47:48,723
How about that!

554
00:47:49,332 --> 00:47:51,323
This is what I use on meddlers.

555
00:47:52,092 --> 00:47:54,082
John might be a meddler.

556
00:47:54,531 --> 00:47:56,806
No, little lamb. Don't touch it.

557
00:47:57,411 --> 00:48:00,847
Don't touch my knife.
That makes me mad. Very, very mad.

558
00:48:02,531 --> 00:48:05,045
Now, just tell me. Where's the money hid?

559
00:48:05,331 --> 00:48:07,640
But I swore.
I promised John I wouldn't tell.

560
00:48:07,731 --> 00:48:09,722
John doesn't matter!

561
00:48:10,851 --> 00:48:15,765
Can't I get that through your head,
you poor, silly, disgusting little wretch?

562
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:22,959
There now. You made me lose my temper.

563
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:27,728
I'm sorry. I'm real sorry.

564
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:31,124
Now, just tell me. Where's it hid, honey?

565
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:34,038
- I'll tell.
- I told you to keep your mouth shut.

566
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:38,327
It ain't fair to make Pearl tell
when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.

567
00:48:38,409 --> 00:48:39,888
Well, I declare!

568
00:48:39,969 --> 00:48:43,598
Sometimes I think poor ol' John
might make it to heaven yet.

569
00:48:44,009 --> 00:48:48,844
- All right, boy. Where's the money?
- In the cellar. Under a stone in the floor.

570
00:48:49,289 --> 00:48:53,601
- lt'll go hard if I find you're lyin', boy.
- I'm not lyin'. Go look for yourself.

571
00:48:55,889 --> 00:48:57,880
All right.

572
00:49:07,408 --> 00:49:09,399
- Come along.
- What?

573
00:49:12,608 --> 00:49:14,599
Go ahead of me. The both of you.

574
00:49:15,888 --> 00:49:17,879
Down those stairs.

575
00:49:21,767 --> 00:49:23,997
You don't reckon I'd leave you,
do you, boy?

576
00:49:24,087 --> 00:49:27,875
- Well, don't you believe me?
- Why, sure, boy. Sure.

577
00:49:31,407 --> 00:49:33,637
And where now? Mind, no tricks, now.

578
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,878
I can't abide a liar.

579
00:49:36,087 --> 00:49:38,078
Yonder.

580
00:49:41,127 --> 00:49:43,117
Oh, no, you don't.

581
00:49:47,566 --> 00:49:50,922
- Now where, boy, where?
- Under the stone in the floor.

582
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:02,197
This is concrete.

583
00:50:02,446 --> 00:50:05,243
John made a sin. John told a lie.

584
00:50:07,925 --> 00:50:09,916
The Lord's a-talking to me now.

585
00:50:10,565 --> 00:50:15,593
He's a-saying "A liar
is an abomination before mine eyes."

586
00:50:17,205 --> 00:50:19,196
Speak, boy, where's it hid?

587
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,636
Speak.

588
00:50:21,725 --> 00:50:26,161
Speak, or I'll cut your throat and leave you
to drip like a hog in butchering time.

589
00:50:26,244 --> 00:50:29,122
Pearl, shut up. Pearl, you swore!

590
00:50:30,524 --> 00:50:32,242
You could save him, little bird.

591
00:50:32,644 --> 00:50:34,635
It's in my doll!

592
00:50:38,084 --> 00:50:40,075
The doll!

593
00:50:42,844 --> 00:50:44,835
Why, sure!

594
00:50:45,364 --> 00:50:47,797
The last place anybody'd think to look.

595
00:51:13,642 --> 00:51:16,031
Uncle Birdie Steptoe.

596
00:51:16,322 --> 00:51:20,281
Open that door, you spawn
of the devil's own strumpet!

597
00:51:46,841 --> 00:51:48,832
Uncle Birdie!

598
00:51:51,601 --> 00:51:53,192
- Uncle Birdie.
- John.

599
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,836
Hide us, Uncle Birdie.
He's a-coming with his knife.

600
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,272
It's me. John Harper and Pearl.
You told me to come.

601
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,476
- Johnny?
- Uncle Birdie, oh, please.

602
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,357
Please! Wake up!

603
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,477
I swear on the Book, I never done it.

604
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:26,670
There's still the river.

605
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:36,429
The skiff is under the willow.

606
00:52:54,598 --> 00:52:56,589
Children!

607
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:38,702
"Dear Walt and lcey,

608
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:41,827
I bet you've been worried
and gave us up for lost."

609
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:46,662
"Took the kids down here with me
for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm."

610
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:50,621
"Thought a little change of scenery
would do us all a world of good

611
00:55:50,709 --> 00:55:53,098
after so much trouble and heartache."

612
00:55:53,829 --> 00:55:57,458
"At least the kids will get
a-plenty of good home cooking."

613
00:55:57,629 --> 00:55:59,381
"Your devoted Harry Powell."

614
00:55:59,469 --> 00:56:01,460
Now, ain't you relieved, Walt?

615
00:56:01,669 --> 00:56:06,697
Sure. But you was worried too, Mother.
Taking off with never a word of goodbye!

616
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:09,986
I figured them gypsies busted in
and done off with all three of them.

617
00:56:10,069 --> 00:56:12,502
You and your gypsies.
They been gone a week.

618
00:56:12,588 --> 00:56:16,501
Sure. But not before one of 'em
knifed a farmer and stole his horse.

619
00:56:16,588 --> 00:56:18,897
Never caught the gypsy. Nor the horse.

620
00:56:34,627 --> 00:56:37,858
Such times,
when young 'uns run the roads.

621
00:56:37,947 --> 00:56:39,938
Go away, children.

622
00:56:46,347 --> 00:56:47,985
Hungry, I suppose?

623
00:56:48,067 --> 00:56:51,264
Well, I can't spare you more
than one potato apiece.

624
00:56:51,907 --> 00:56:54,341
- Where are yourfolks?
- Ain't got none.

625
00:56:54,467 --> 00:56:56,457
Oh, go away, go away.

626
00:57:05,506 --> 00:57:08,737
An ungrateful child is an
abomination before the eyes of God.

627
00:57:08,826 --> 00:57:13,661
The world is going to damnation because
of young 'uns flying in the face of age.

628
00:57:27,385 --> 00:57:28,943
They make soup out of them,

629
00:57:29,025 --> 00:57:32,222
but I wouldn't know
how to go about getting him open.

630
00:58:26,742 --> 00:58:29,131
We're going to spend the night on land.

631
00:59:33,219 --> 00:59:35,608
Are we going home now, John?

632
01:01:41,373 --> 01:01:43,762
Don't he never sleep?

633
01:01:49,533 --> 01:01:51,524
Pearl, wake up. Come on!

634
01:04:28,486 --> 01:04:31,523
You two youngsters
get up here to me this instant.

635
01:04:32,045 --> 01:04:36,197
Get on up to my house.
Mind me, now. I'll get me a switch.

636
01:04:50,725 --> 01:04:54,034
- Don't you hurt her.
- Hurt her? Wash her's more like it!

637
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:58,758
- Ruby! Clary! Mary!
- Yes, Miss Cooper.

638
01:04:59,924 --> 01:05:01,915
Bring your baskets.

639
01:05:05,964 --> 01:05:07,602
Nicely picked, Clary.

640
01:05:08,044 --> 01:05:10,035
Mary, put the big ones on top.

641
01:05:10,284 --> 01:05:12,559
Ruby, most of them
ain't fit to go to market.

642
01:05:12,644 --> 01:05:14,077
Put them down.

643
01:05:14,164 --> 01:05:17,872
Ruby, run to the house and fetch
the tub and put it by the pump.

644
01:05:18,123 --> 01:05:21,160
Clary... Mary,
run up and fetch a bar of laundry soap.

645
01:05:21,243 --> 01:05:22,562
Yes, Miss Cooper.

646
01:05:22,643 --> 01:05:25,840
And a scrub brush!
Come on up to the house, children.

647
01:05:28,043 --> 01:05:30,637
Gracious, if you ain't a sight to beat all!

648
01:05:31,003 --> 01:05:32,994
Where you from?

649
01:05:34,003 --> 01:05:35,800
Where are your folks?

650
01:05:35,883 --> 01:05:37,873
Come on, speak up, now.

651
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:42,635
Gracious,
so I've got two more mouths to feed.

652
01:06:08,841 --> 01:06:10,991
Howdy, Miss Cooper.
What happened to my milk?

653
01:06:11,081 --> 01:06:12,560
Price of milk what it is, not on your life.

654
01:06:12,881 --> 01:06:15,270
Do better making butter
with the cream. Sell it retail.

655
01:06:15,361 --> 01:06:18,876
Make smearcase for the children,
feed what's left to my hogs.

656
01:06:18,961 --> 01:06:21,076
- She talks to herself.
- All the time.

657
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:24,755
- Your ma's funny.
- She ain't our ma. We just live with her.

658
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,270
- Where are your folks?
- Someplace.

659
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,157
My daddy's in Detroit.

660
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,711
Mary!

661
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:35,911
Honey. Good morning, Miss Cooper.

662
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,150
I'm saving up to buy you a bracelet.

663
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:43,273
Never mind that, don't forget your visit
this Sunday - and come to church with us.

664
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:46,310
See you Sunday, love.

665
01:06:47,079 --> 01:06:49,070
Take your baskets in, children.

666
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:51,436
Women is fools.

667
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:53,510
All of 'em.

668
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:56,710
Looky there.

669
01:06:56,799 --> 01:06:59,233
She'll be losing her mind
to a tricky mouth and a full moon,

670
01:06:59,319 --> 01:07:03,153
and like as not, I'll be saddled
with the consequences.

671
01:07:03,878 --> 01:07:05,869
Here's what you owe me.

672
01:07:07,078 --> 01:07:09,069
One, two, three, four, five...

673
01:07:09,278 --> 01:07:11,314
Where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?

674
01:07:11,398 --> 01:07:12,797
She went.

675
01:07:12,878 --> 01:07:14,869
John, you go find Ruby.

676
01:07:15,078 --> 01:07:18,548
Big Ruby's my bothersome girl.
She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em.

677
01:07:18,638 --> 01:07:22,870
But she's got mother hands with the
young 'uns, so what are you to say?

678
01:07:23,558 --> 01:07:25,388
How about tonight, Ruby?

679
01:07:25,477 --> 01:07:27,786
- What gives?
- The old lady's around.

680
01:07:28,957 --> 01:07:30,948
How about Thursday?

681
01:07:32,197 --> 01:07:35,587
The old gal thinks she comes in
for sewing lessons on Thursday.

682
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:37,668
Miss Cooper wants you.

683
01:07:40,837 --> 01:07:43,590
And will you show me your dolly,
little lady?

684
01:07:44,797 --> 01:07:46,708
I see you got two more peeps
to your brood.

685
01:07:46,797 --> 01:07:50,186
- Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
- How's your own boy, Miss Cooper?

686
01:07:50,276 --> 01:07:54,906
Haven't heard from Ralph since last
Christmas. Still, I've got a new crop.

687
01:07:55,916 --> 01:07:58,828
I'm a strong tree
with branches for many birds.

688
01:07:59,156 --> 01:08:02,751
I'm good for something in this old world,
and I know it too.

689
01:08:24,555 --> 01:08:28,594
Now, old Pharaoh,
he was king of Egypt land,

690
01:08:29,235 --> 01:08:30,952
and he had a daughter.

691
01:08:31,514 --> 01:08:33,505
And once upon a time,

692
01:08:35,274 --> 01:08:37,026
she was walking along by the river bank

693
01:08:37,114 --> 01:08:40,629
and she seen something bumping
and scraping along on a sand bar

694
01:08:40,714 --> 01:08:44,343
down under the willows.
And you know what it was, children?

695
01:08:44,714 --> 01:08:45,590
No.

696
01:08:45,674 --> 01:08:48,313
Now, it was a skiff, washed up on the bar.

697
01:08:49,594 --> 01:08:51,346
And who do you reckon was in it?

698
01:08:51,434 --> 01:08:53,424
Pearl and John.

699
01:08:53,833 --> 01:08:58,623
Not this time. There was only
one young 'un, a little boy babe.

700
01:08:59,033 --> 01:09:01,866
- And you know who he was, children?
- No.

701
01:09:03,713 --> 01:09:06,625
It was Moses. A king of men.

702
01:09:07,233 --> 01:09:09,224
Moses, children.

703
01:09:09,713 --> 01:09:11,704
Now, off to bed with you.

704
01:09:12,073 --> 01:09:14,666
John, get me an apple.

705
01:09:30,312 --> 01:09:32,303
And get one for yourself too.

706
01:09:45,031 --> 01:09:47,022
John, where are your folks?

707
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,382
Dead.

708
01:09:51,111 --> 01:09:53,102
Where are you from?

709
01:09:53,351 --> 01:09:55,342
Upriver.

710
01:09:56,391 --> 01:10:00,781
I didn't figure you'd rowed that skiff
all the way up from Parkersburg.

711
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:15,861
Tell me that story again.

712
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:18,301
Story? What story, honey?

713
01:10:19,509 --> 01:10:20,942
About them kings.

714
01:10:21,029 --> 01:10:24,738
And the queen found down on
the sand bar that time in the skiff.

715
01:10:24,829 --> 01:10:27,901
Kings?
Why, there was only one king, honey.

716
01:10:29,149 --> 01:10:31,140
I mind you said there was two.

717
01:10:32,349 --> 01:10:34,909
Well, shoot now. Maybe there was.

718
01:10:36,309 --> 01:10:38,698
Yes, come to think of it, there was two.

719
01:11:04,227 --> 01:11:06,377
Must be Thursday. Here comes Ruby.

720
01:11:13,747 --> 01:11:15,738
Here I go.

721
01:11:21,667 --> 01:11:23,942
Why, you're Ruby, ain't you, my child?

722
01:11:24,027 --> 01:11:25,220
Can I have this?

723
01:11:25,306 --> 01:11:27,740
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.

724
01:11:27,906 --> 01:11:29,578
- Will you buy me an ice cream?
- Of course.

725
01:11:29,666 --> 01:11:31,941
- Watch out, Preacher.
- Why, Preacher!

726
01:11:32,026 --> 01:11:34,017
Shut your dirty mouths.

727
01:11:44,866 --> 01:11:46,218
Ain't I pretty?

728
01:11:46,305 --> 01:11:50,184
Why, you're the prettiest thing
I ever seen in all my wandering.

729
01:11:50,265 --> 01:11:52,699
Ain't nobody never told you that, Ruby?

730
01:11:53,105 --> 01:11:55,380
No, no one never did.

731
01:11:55,465 --> 01:11:58,104
There's two new ones out your place,
ain't there?

732
01:11:58,185 --> 01:12:00,176
Uh-huh.

733
01:12:00,465 --> 01:12:02,854
- What's their names?
- Pearl and John.

734
01:12:04,745 --> 01:12:08,100
- Is there a doll?
- Only they don't never let me play with it.

735
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:18,895
Did you ever see such pretty eyes
in all your born days?

736
01:12:18,984 --> 01:12:20,702
Don't let him get away, sugar.

737
01:12:20,784 --> 01:12:25,335
He ain't like you all. Next time, I won't
even ask him to buy me an ice cream.

738
01:12:33,343 --> 01:12:35,334
I's bitten bad.

739
01:12:38,943 --> 01:12:42,060
- Ruby, you didn't have money to buy this.
- You'll whip me.

740
01:12:42,143 --> 01:12:43,701
When did I ever?

741
01:12:43,783 --> 01:12:47,219
- This man at the drugstore, he gave...
- The drugstore?

742
01:12:48,103 --> 01:12:51,617
Miss Cooper, I never been
to sewing lessons all them times.

743
01:12:51,702 --> 01:12:53,693
What you been up to, Ruby?

744
01:12:54,182 --> 01:12:56,173
I been out with men.

745
01:12:57,702 --> 01:12:59,693
Child.

746
01:13:03,662 --> 01:13:07,894
You were looking for love, Ruby,
in the only foolish way you knew how.

747
01:13:11,822 --> 01:13:13,812
We all need love, Ruby.

748
01:13:14,421 --> 01:13:16,412
I lost the love of my son.

749
01:13:16,821 --> 01:13:18,812
I found it with you all.

750
01:13:20,621 --> 01:13:23,658
You're going to grow up to be a strong,
fine woman.

751
01:13:23,821 --> 01:13:27,655
- I'm going to see to it that you do.
- This gentleman weren't like them.

752
01:13:27,741 --> 01:13:30,414
He just give me a book
and buy me an ice cream.

753
01:13:30,541 --> 01:13:33,578
- Now, who was this?
- He didn't ask me for nothing.

754
01:13:33,821 --> 01:13:36,414
- What did you talk about?
- Pearl and John.

755
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:40,133
John and Pearl? Is he their pap?

756
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,411
I don't know.

757
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:45,256
Wonder why he hasn't been to the house.

758
01:14:03,179 --> 01:14:05,170
Miss Cooper!

759
01:14:05,419 --> 01:14:07,979
- What?
- The man!

760
01:14:12,339 --> 01:14:13,977
Good morning, ladies.

761
01:14:14,059 --> 01:14:17,290
- How do?
- Why, you're Miss Cooper, I take it?

762
01:14:17,978 --> 01:14:20,048
It's about that John and that Pearl?

763
01:14:20,138 --> 01:14:22,129
Oh, them poor little lambs.

764
01:14:22,298 --> 01:14:24,653
To think I never hoped
to see them again in this world.

765
01:14:24,738 --> 01:14:28,970
Oh, dear madam, if you was to know
what a crown of thorns I've borne

766
01:14:29,058 --> 01:14:31,208
in my search for them stray chicks.

767
01:14:32,178 --> 01:14:34,169
Ruby, go fetch them kids.

768
01:14:37,178 --> 01:14:39,850
Oh, madam,
I see you're looking at my hands.

769
01:14:40,577 --> 01:14:44,456
Shall I tell you the story of Left-hand,
Right-hand, the tale of good and evil?

770
01:14:44,537 --> 01:14:48,371
It was with this left hand that Cain struck
the blow that laid his brother low.

771
01:14:48,457 --> 01:14:52,211
- Them kids is yours?
- My own flesh and blood.

772
01:14:52,577 --> 01:14:56,456
- Where's your missus?
- She run off with a drummer.

773
01:14:57,137 --> 01:14:59,571
- During prayer meeting.
- Where's she at?

774
01:14:59,657 --> 01:15:02,124
Down the river somewheres.
Parkersburg, Cincinnati.

775
01:15:02,216 --> 01:15:05,686
- One of them Sodoms of the Ohio river.
- She took them kids with her?

776
01:15:05,776 --> 01:15:08,688
Oh, heaven only knows
what unholy sights and sounds

777
01:15:08,776 --> 01:15:13,133
them innocent babes has heard in the
dens of perdition where she dragged 'em.

778
01:15:13,216 --> 01:15:17,846
Right funny, ain't it, how they rode
all the way upriver in a ten-foot john boat.

779
01:15:19,376 --> 01:15:22,891
- Are they well, Miss Cooper?
- A sight better than they was.

780
01:15:24,335 --> 01:15:27,771
Gracious, gracious,
you are a good woman, Miss Cooper.

781
01:15:28,055 --> 01:15:30,523
How you figuring to raise them two
without a woman?

782
01:15:30,615 --> 01:15:33,891
The Lord will provide.
The Lord is merciful.

783
01:15:34,575 --> 01:15:36,770
Oh, what a day this is.

784
01:15:36,855 --> 01:15:38,846
And there's little John.

785
01:15:39,055 --> 01:15:41,444
- What's wrong, John?
- Come to me, boy.

786
01:15:41,655 --> 01:15:44,408
- What's wrong, John?
- Didn't you hear me, boy?

787
01:15:44,495 --> 01:15:46,769
When your dad says "come"
you should mind him.

788
01:15:46,854 --> 01:15:48,651
He ain't my dad.

789
01:15:51,894 --> 01:15:54,283
No, and he ain't no preacher neither.

790
01:16:02,214 --> 01:16:05,331
Just march yourself yonder
to your horse, mister.

791
01:16:08,373 --> 01:16:10,364
March, mister. I'm not foolin'!

792
01:16:13,413 --> 01:16:17,201
All right. But you haven't
heard the last of Harry Powell yet!

793
01:16:18,253 --> 01:16:21,529
The Lord God Jehovah
will guide my hand in vengeance.

794
01:16:23,093 --> 01:16:25,084
You devils!

795
01:16:26,413 --> 01:16:29,210
You whores of Babylon!

796
01:16:34,012 --> 01:16:36,003
I'll be back! When it's dark!

797
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:11,239
Shame on you, Ruby, mooning around
the house after that mad dog of a man.

798
01:18:13,128 --> 01:18:14,720
Merciful heavens!

799
01:18:15,688 --> 01:18:19,396
Ruby, go get the children out of bed
and bring them down here.

800
01:18:21,327 --> 01:18:23,318
Women are such darn fools.

801
01:18:41,846 --> 01:18:44,076
It's a hard world for little things.

802
01:19:04,845 --> 01:19:08,679
Now, there was this sneaking,
no-account, ornery King Herod,

803
01:19:08,765 --> 01:19:10,881
and when he heard of
little Jesus growin' up,

804
01:19:10,965 --> 01:19:14,640
he figured "Well, shoot, there
won't be room for the both of us."

805
01:19:15,005 --> 01:19:16,324
"I'll nip this in the bud."

806
01:19:16,405 --> 01:19:19,920
But he wasn't sure which of all them
babies in the land was King Jesus.

807
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:22,313
So that cruel old King Herod figured,

808
01:19:22,404 --> 01:19:25,999
if he was to kill all the babies in the land
he'd be sure and get little Jesus.

809
01:19:26,564 --> 01:19:28,953
When little King Jesus'
ma and pa heard about this,

810
01:19:29,044 --> 01:19:30,523
what do you reckon they done?

811
01:19:30,604 --> 01:19:33,118
- They hid in a closet.
- They hid under the porch.

812
01:19:33,204 --> 01:19:35,195
No. They went a-running.

813
01:19:35,724 --> 01:19:39,353
Well, now, John, you're right.
That's just what they done.

814
01:19:39,564 --> 01:19:41,873
Little King Jesus' ma and pa
saddled a mule

815
01:19:41,964 --> 01:19:44,318
and they rode all the way down
into Egypt land.

816
01:19:44,403 --> 01:19:47,634
Yeah, and that's where the queen
found them in the bulrushes.

817
01:19:47,723 --> 01:19:50,681
Oh, no, that wasn't the same story.
That was little King Moses.

818
01:19:50,763 --> 01:19:54,472
But just the same, it did seem like
it was a plague time for little ones.

819
01:19:54,563 --> 01:19:56,997
Them olden days. Them hard, hard times.

820
01:20:04,203 --> 01:20:05,954
Figured I was gone, huh?

821
01:20:06,042 --> 01:20:08,636
Run. Hide on the staircase. Run quick!

822
01:20:09,002 --> 01:20:10,993
Ruby, get!

823
01:20:11,402 --> 01:20:13,632
- What do you want?
- I want them kids.

824
01:20:14,282 --> 01:20:15,954
What do you want them for?

825
01:20:16,042 --> 01:20:18,875
- None of your business, madam.
- I'm giving you to the count of three to go.

826
01:20:18,962 --> 01:20:21,954
Then I'm coming across
to the kitchen to shoot you!

827
01:20:35,641 --> 01:20:37,632
Miss Booth? Rachel Cooper.

828
01:20:37,801 --> 01:20:39,792
Get your state troopers out to my place.

829
01:20:39,881 --> 01:20:42,031
I got something trapped in my barn.

830
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,954
- I'll go see to Pearl.
- I'll make coffee.

831
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,791
She's all right.

832
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,835
John, you know when you're little
you have more endurance

833
01:21:10,919 --> 01:21:13,069
than God is ever to grant you again?

834
01:21:13,639 --> 01:21:16,551
Children are man at his strongest.
They abide.

835
01:21:30,439 --> 01:21:34,272
- Why didn't you call us before now?
- Didn't want your dirty shoes on my floor.

836
01:21:34,358 --> 01:21:35,473
Is that him?

837
01:21:35,558 --> 01:21:38,391
Yes. Mind where you shoot, boys.
There are children here.

838
01:21:38,478 --> 01:21:42,596
Harry Powell, you're under arrest
for the murder of Willa Harper.

839
01:21:44,038 --> 01:21:46,029
Drop that knife, Powell.

840
01:21:47,558 --> 01:21:48,513
Don't.

841
01:21:54,437 --> 01:21:55,916
Here!

842
01:21:55,997 --> 01:21:58,067
Take it back, Dad. Take it back!

843
01:21:58,157 --> 01:22:01,229
I don't want it, Dad! It's too much! Here!

844
01:22:12,197 --> 01:22:14,188
Lynch him!

845
01:22:14,837 --> 01:22:16,588
Bluebeard!

846
01:22:16,676 --> 01:22:19,554
- 25 wives!
- And he killed every last one of 'em.

847
01:22:19,636 --> 01:22:22,753
- If the people of Marshall County...
- Bluebeard!

848
01:22:28,876 --> 01:22:30,867
Will you identify the prisoner?

849
01:22:31,516 --> 01:22:32,915
Please, little lad,

850
01:22:32,996 --> 01:22:37,989
won't you look yonder and tell the court
if that is the man that killed your mother?

851
01:22:44,955 --> 01:22:48,345
It's all right, Mrs Cooper,
you can take the little fellow away.

852
01:22:48,555 --> 01:22:50,705
Merry Christmas to you and yours,
Mrs Cooper.

853
01:22:50,795 --> 01:22:55,027
And what's Santa Claus going to
bring you for Christmas, little man?

854
01:23:05,114 --> 01:23:07,105
- That's Pearl!
- Get your coats.

855
01:23:07,914 --> 01:23:09,870
Them's her orphans.

856
01:23:09,954 --> 01:23:11,626
- Where's Ruby?
- She went.

857
01:23:11,714 --> 01:23:14,433
Them poor little lambs.

858
01:23:14,514 --> 01:23:18,302
Them is the ones he sinned against,
my friends.

859
01:23:18,754 --> 01:23:20,744
Go out the back door.

860
01:23:24,233 --> 01:23:26,463
Ain't we going to the bus depot?

861
01:23:28,033 --> 01:23:31,423
Dragging the name of the Lord
through the evil mud of his soul!

862
01:23:31,513 --> 01:23:36,064
- String that Bluebeard up to a post!
- He's Satan hiding behind the cross!

863
01:24:20,551 --> 01:24:24,021
I love him. You think he's like them others.

864
01:24:29,790 --> 01:24:31,781
You were so mad, you shot him.

865
01:24:47,190 --> 01:24:48,588
- Hey, Bart.
- Yeah?

866
01:24:48,669 --> 01:24:52,457
- We're saving this bird up for you.
- This time it'll be a privilege.

867
01:25:17,348 --> 01:25:19,862
I'm glad they sent me nothing.
It's never nothing I want.

868
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:24,578
Just something to show me how fancy
and smart they've come up in the world.

869
01:25:30,068 --> 01:25:31,898
Can we give you your presents now?

870
01:25:31,987 --> 01:25:36,538
Shoot, you don't mean to say
you got me a present? Shoot, now.

871
01:25:42,947 --> 01:25:44,175
Ruby.

872
01:25:44,867 --> 01:25:46,858
A pot-holder!

873
01:25:46,947 --> 01:25:49,541
And it's much neater than last year, Ruby.

874
01:25:50,467 --> 01:25:51,866
Clary.

875
01:25:53,226 --> 01:25:58,175
Another pot-holder! Ain't that thoughtful.
I'm always burning my hands.

876
01:26:00,786 --> 01:26:03,459
This doesn't look basted.
This looks made!

877
01:26:04,386 --> 01:26:06,775
And you finished the edge
with a chain-stitch.

878
01:26:06,866 --> 01:26:08,857
Oh, that's just dandy, Clary.

879
01:26:11,706 --> 01:26:13,697
Another pot-holder?

880
01:26:18,745 --> 01:26:21,305
Oh, now, did you two make this together?

881
01:26:21,385 --> 01:26:23,376
He helped us some.

882
01:26:31,985 --> 01:26:34,579
That's the richest gift a body could have.

883
01:26:35,945 --> 01:26:39,732
And your presents are in the
cupboard under the china closet.

884
01:26:41,264 --> 01:26:42,663
Ruby.

885
01:26:44,344 --> 01:26:46,335
This is yours.

886
01:27:01,463 --> 01:27:05,502
Lord save little children.
You'd think the world'd be ashamed

887
01:27:05,583 --> 01:27:10,213
to name such a day as Christmas for one
of them, then go on in the same old way.

888
01:27:11,383 --> 01:27:15,740
My soul is humble when I see the way
little ones accept their lot.

889
01:27:17,063 --> 01:27:19,133
Lord save little children.

890
01:27:19,223 --> 01:27:21,531
The wind blows and the rains are cold...

891
01:27:22,502 --> 01:27:24,493
yet they abide.

892
01:27:51,541 --> 01:27:53,850
That watch sure is a fine loud ticker.

893
01:27:55,541 --> 01:28:00,171
Be nice to have someone round the house
who can give me the right time of day.

894
01:28:00,261 --> 01:28:02,775
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.

895
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:07,578
Well, a fella just can't go around
with run-down, busted watches.

896
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:15,691
They abide and they endure.
