1
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,440
Oh, fuck.

2
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,160
- Uh, yeah?
- Miles, can you move your car, please?

3
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,040
- Why?
- Because the roofers gotta get the truck in.

4
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,440
- You didn't park too good. Okay?
- Yeah. All right.

5
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,440
Hold on.

6
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,200
Sorry. Sorry, gentlemen.

7
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,320
Sorry.

8
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,040
Oh, fuck me!

9
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,160
I know I said
I would be there by noon...

10
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,920
but, uh, there's all of this work
going on at my building...

11
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,320
and it's just a total nightmare.

12
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,680
I had a bunch of stuff
I had to deal with this morning...

13
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,600
but I'm on my way.

14
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,080
I'm out the door right now.

15
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,640
- Hi, Simon.
- Hey, Miles.

16
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,560
- Triple espresso, please?
- For here?

17
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,440
Uh, no, actually.
I'm running late. Make it to go.

18
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,320
And give me a New York Times
and a spinach croissant.

19
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,920
Thank you.

20
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,200
- Ah!
- Well, hello!

21
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,440
- Hello, Mrs. Erganian. How are you?
- Come on in.

22
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,320
- Thank you. Is Jack still here?
- Yes.

23
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,920
Shot on the way to the 118.

24
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,240
Look what the cat dragged.

25
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,120
- Hi, everybody. Sorry.
- Hey.

26
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,040
Somebody finally arrived.

27
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,960
You finally got here. Mr. Prompt.

28
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,840
- Oh, remember my kids? Alex, Helen?
- Hi. How are you?

29
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,200
We were thinking maybe you went
the wrong way,you went to Tijuana...

30
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,120
- Right.
- and they don't let you back.

31
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,040
- Yes! Yes!
- Daddy!

32
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,920
- I had to bribe them.
- Hey, Miles.

33
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,840
Hey. How are you, Christine?

34
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,760
Yeah, the freeway was unbelievable.

35
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,640
Unbelievable.
It was bumper-to-bumper the whole way.

36
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,520
People getting an early start
on the weekend, I guess.

37
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,440
Granted, I got a late start, but--

38
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,840
Well, we're just glad you made it.

39
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,240
Christine, why don't you
ask Miles about the cake?

40
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,160
- Oh, good idea. Come with me.
- What's this?

41
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,040
We don't really have time for that,
'cause we gotta hit the road.

42
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,200
- Oh, come on.!
It's just gonna take a second.!
- Yeah.

43
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,640
Mmm.

44
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,840
Jack tells us you are publishing a book.
Congratulations.

45
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,720
- Uh--
- Yes, congratulations.

46
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,400
Yes, well, uh,
it's not exactly finalized yet.

47
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,800
- So-- There has been some interest, and--
- Your friend is modest.

48
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,960
Oh, come on, Miles.
Don't be so modest. Indulge them.

49
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,160
- Don't make me out to be a liar.
- What is the subject of your book?

50
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,400
- Nonfiction?
- Uh, no. It's-- It's a novel.

51
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,640
- Fiction. Yes.
- Oh.

52
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,560
Although there is quite a bit
from my own life...

53
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,440
so I suppose that, technically,
some of it is nonfiction.

54
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,640
Good. I like nonfiction.

55
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,080
There is so much to know
about this world.

56
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,440
I think you read something somebody
just invented it, waste of time.

57
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,760
That's an interesting perspective.

58
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,080
- So, which one do you like better?
- Oh, well, I like them both.

59
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,480
But, um, if pressed, I would have to say
that I prefer the dark.

60
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,880
Told ya.!

61
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,080
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

62
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,800
- Bye.
- Bye.

63
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,400
Bye.

64
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,280
Where the fuck were you, man? Huh?
I was dying in there.

65
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,360
- We're supposed to be
a hundred miles away by now.
- I can't help the traffic.

66
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,280
Oh, come on. You're fucking hungover.
You know you are.

67
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,800
Okay, there was
a tasting last night, yes.

68
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,480
But I wanted to get us something nice
for the ride up. Check out the box.

69
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,400
Why did you tell them
that my novel was being published?

70
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,960
- 'Cause you said you had it all lined up.
- No, I didn't. No. No.

71
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,240
What I said was that there was
some interest at Conundrum.

72
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,120
- Yeah. Conundrum.
- And that one of the editors
was passing it to a senior editor.

73
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,520
Sounds pretty good to me.
Sounds like you're in.

74
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,440
No. It's a long shot.

75
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,880
Besides, Conundrum,
it's just a small specialty press.

76
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,800
I'm not gonna get my hopes up.

77
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,720
You know? I've stopped caring.

78
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,600
The hell with it.
I have stopped caring.

79
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,720
It sounds like it's gonna happen this time.
I mean, I can feel it.

80
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,120
I think this is the one. Huh?

81
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,040
I'm really proud of you, man.

82
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,080
- Don't open that now. It's warm.
- Why not?

83
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,120
Jack, that is a 1992 Byron.
It's really rare. Okay?

84
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,640
- I've been saving it. Don't--
- All right. I won't open it.

85
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,600
Jack!

86
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,680
Half of it gone.

87
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,040
Hey, shut up. Okay?

88
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,920
Here's to a great week.

89
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,920
Come on.

90
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,640
Yes. Absolutely.

91
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,560
Despite your crass behavior...

92
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,760
I'm actually glad
we're getting this time together.

93
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,680
Yeah. Me too.

94
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,560
I've been looking forward to this
for a long time.

95
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,520
- Was beginning to think
it was never gonna happen.
- Man! That's tasty!

96
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,440
That's 1 00% pinot noir.
Single vineyard.

97
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,360
They don't even make it anymore.

98
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,240
- Pinot noir?
- Mm-hmm.

99
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,200
- Then how come it's white?
- Oh,Jesus.

100
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,120
Don't ask questions like that
up in wine country.

101
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,320
- They'll think you're some kind of dumbshit.
-Just tell me.

102
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,200
Color in red wines
comes from the skins.

103
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,040
This juice, on the other hand,
is free run...

104
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,960
so that there's no skin contact
during fermentation--

105
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,800
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?

106
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,720
- Oh,yeah.yeah.
- And?

107
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,640
It's great.

108
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,520
I mean, there are so many improvements.
It's much tighter.

109
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,840
Just seems-- I don't know,
more congealed or something.

110
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,200
Mm-hmm. What about the new ending?
Did you like that?

111
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,680
Oh, yeah. New ending
vastly superior to the old ending.

112
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,600
There is no new ending.

113
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,480
Page 7 50 on is exactly the same.

114
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,880
Well, maybe it just seemed new...

115
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,520
because everything leading up to it
was so different?

116
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,480
Yeah! That must be it!

117
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,000
Whoa. Why are we getting off?

118
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,880
- Uh, I just wanna make one quick stop.
- For what?

119
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,760
- I just thought we could say
a quick hello to my mother.
- Your mother?

120
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,680
Look, it's her birthday tomorrow.
Okay?

121
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,880
- And I don't feel right driving by
and not stopping in.
- Okay.

122
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,680
- It'll take a second.
She's right off the freeway.
- Okay.!

123
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,560
I didn't know it was her birthday.
How old is she gonna be?

124
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,520
Uh, oh... 70-something.

125
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,240
Oh. Here, hold these
for just a second.

126
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,320
Thank you.

127
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,720
- Surprise.!
- Surprise!

128
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,640
- Happy birthday, Mom!
- Happy birthday!

129
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,320
Oh, my God! Miles! And Jack!

130
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,680
What a surprise!

131
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,480
I can't remember the last time
you brought me flowers!

132
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,400
Happy birthday, Mom.

133
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,320
They're from both of us.

134
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,920
- A famous actor
bringing me flowers for my birthday!
- Right? Yeah!

135
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,440
- Don't I feel special?
- And champagne.!

136
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,560
- Famous actor's getting married next week, Mom.
- Oh, that's right!

137
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,480
Isn't that nice.

138
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,760
I hope that girl knows
how lucky she is...

139
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,680
marrying no less
than Derek Sommersby.

140
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,520
Gosh, that was, like, 1 1 years ago,
Mrs. Raymond.

141
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,480
Well,you were wonderful in that show.!

142
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,600
Why that didn't make you the biggest
movie star in the world is a sin!

143
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,040
Oh, now, Miles...

144
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,000
why didn't you tell me you were coming
and bringing this handsome man?

145
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,920
Look how I'm dressed!

146
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,320
I've gotta run and put my face on.

147
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,240
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.

148
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,800
Oh, stop it!

149
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,720
Make yourselves comfortable.

150
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,600
- You boys hungry?
- Yeah, I'm hungry.

151
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,400
Along with the battle casualties...

152
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,320
Just a snack.

153
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,240
the Germans lost almost a million men.

154
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,600
To replace them, Hitler turned
to his last resort of manpower.

155
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,480
This is delicious, Mrs. Raymond.
Absolutely delicious.

156
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,880
- Mmm.
- They're just leftovers.

157
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,800
I-Is this chicken?

158
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,720
I could have made something fancier...

159
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,600
if a certain someone had let me know
that a certain someone...

160
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,520
was coming for a visit
and bringing a certain special friend.

161
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,200
It was a surprise, Mom.

162
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,600
And I could've already put clean sheets...

163
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,600
on the other bed and the foldout.

164
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,560
You are staying.

165
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,320
Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up
at 1 1 :30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton.

166
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,520
They do a magnificent job there.

167
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,400
- You talked to Wendy?
-Just now.

168
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,880
She's thrilled! And the twins--

169
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,280
No, no, I bet. I bet. Yeah.

170
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,160
Well, you know,Jack is pretty eager
to, uh, to get up to, um--

171
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,240
You know.

172
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,400
Uh, but, yeah, absolutely.
We'll see how it goes.

173
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,200
Well, you boys do what you want.

174
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,840
I just thought it would be nice for us
to be together as a family on my birthday.

175
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,080
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

176
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,760
I'll be right back.

177
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,560
And what was that other one you did?

178
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,960
The one where you were the jogger.

179
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,760
Oh, that was for, um, Spray 'n Wash.

180
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,680
Spray 'n Wash! That's the one!

181
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,680
Gosh. I remember the girl that was
in it with me. She was somethin'.

182
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,560
I just remember you jogging.

183
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,960
Whoo-hoo!

184
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,360
So, when's the wedding?

185
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,400
Next Saturday, Mom.
Remember? We told you.

186
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,280
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond.
My main man.

187
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,120
Miles, when are you going
to get married again?

188
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,400
I just got divorced, Phyllis.

189
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,480
Two years ago, buddy.

190
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,360
You should get back together...

191
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,600
with Victoria.

192
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,280
She was good for you.

193
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,040
She was good for you!

194
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,440
And so beautiful, and so intelligent.

195
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,360
You knew her, right?

196
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,120
Oh,yeah. Real well. Still do.

197
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,480
I'm worried about you, Miles.

198
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,800
Do you need some money?

199
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,040
Jack.

200
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,520
Jack.

201
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,440
Jack, come on.

202
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,240
A rubber bag food slinger?

203
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,160
Are you kidding me?

204
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,080
Our super-amazing tree house...

205
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,960
brought about by our
two-by-four technology--

206
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,080
Jack! No, no, no, no. She'll wake up.

207
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,000
Who did this?

208
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,880
- I did!
- What?

209
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,800
She was tired, silly.

210
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,720
Our ship was so high!

211
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,640
They need a vacation!

212
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,120
Hamster holiday! Fun for all!

213
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,320
Fuck! Too early in the morning for that.
You know what I mean?

214
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,640
Oh. She's a kid, for God's sake.

215
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,520
As if she would even be attracted
to guys like us in the first place.

216
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,000
Speak for yourself, man. I get chicks
looking at me all the time. All ages.

217
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,920
Dudes too.

218
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,680
Well, it's not worth it.
You pay too big a price.

219
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,920
- It's never free.
- You need to get laid, Miles.

220
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,600
- That's gonna be my best-man gift
to you this week.

221
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,840
I'm gonna get you laid.

222
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,640
Wonderful.

223
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,400
I'm not gonna get you a gift certificate
or a penknife or any of that other horseshit.

224
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,520
- I'd rather have a knife.
- No.

225
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,200
You have been officially depressed
for, like, two years now.

226
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,080
You're a negative guy anyway,
even back in college.

227
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,000
- Mm-hmm.
- And now it's worse.

228
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,240
You're wasting away. Teaching English
to fucking eighth-graders?

229
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,120
When they oughta be reading what you wrote.
Your books, Miles.

230
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,880
- I'm working on it.
- Not working hard enough.

231
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,240
- Are you still seeing that shrink?
- I saw him on Monday.

232
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,080
I spent most of the time
helping him with his computer.

233
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,560
Well, I say fuck therapy and--
What is that stuff you take? Xanax?

234
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,640
And Lexapro, yes.

235
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,960
Well, I say fuck that too.
You need to get your joint worked on, Miles.

236
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,760
Okay,Jack--Jack--

237
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,200
This week is not about me.
It is about you.

238
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,080
I'm gonna show you a good time.

239
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,440
We're gonna drink a lot of good wine,
we're gonna play some golf...

240
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,320
we're gonna eat some great food,
enjoy the scenery...

241
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,600
and we're gonna send you off in style,
mon frere.

242
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,400
And get your bone smooched.

243
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,960
You know what?

244
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,520
Let's take the Santa Rosa Road exit
and hit Sanford first. Okay?

245
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,960
Sounds good to me. I need a drink.

246
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,840
These guys make top-notch pinot
and chardonnay.

247
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,240
One of the best producers
in Santa Barbara County.

248
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,120
- I thought you hated chardonnay.
- No, no, no. I like all varietals.

249
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,720
I just don't generally like the way
they manipulate chardonnay in California.

250
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,480
- Too much oak and secondary
malolactic fermentation.
- Huh.

251
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,320
You see, the reason that this region
is so good for pinot...

252
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,640
is that the cold air off the Pacific
flows in at night...

253
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,120
and it just cools down the berries.

254
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,920
Pinot's a very thin-skinned grape.

255
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,400
It doesn't like constant heat or humidity.
Very delicate.

256
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,200
Let me show you how this is done.

257
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,080
First thing-- hold the glass up and
examine the wine against the light.

258
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,240
You're looking for color and clarity.

259
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,640
-Just get a sense of it. Okay?
- Okay.

260
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,640
Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy?

261
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,520
- Okay?
- Okay.

262
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,440
Now tip it.

263
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,800
What you're doing here is checking for color
density as it thins out towards the rim.

264
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,720
That's gonna tell you how old it is,
among other things.

265
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,640
It's usually
more important with reds.

266
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,560
- Okay?
- Okay.

267
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,480
Now stick your nose in it.

268
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,880
- Yeah?
- Don't be shy.

269
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,120
Really get your nose right in there.
Really--

270
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,640
Mmm. A little citrus.

271
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,640
Maybe some strawberry. Mmm.

272
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,320
Passion fruit. Mmm.

273
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,240
And-- Ah, there's just,
like, the faintest...

274
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,720
soupcon of like, uh, asparagus and--

275
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,680
There's a--just a flutter of, like, a--

276
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,480
like, a nutty Edam cheese.

277
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,520
Wow.

278
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,440
Mmm!

279
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,360
- Strawberries. Yeah.
- Good.

280
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,480
- Strawberries. Not the cheese.
- All right.

281
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,400
Put your glass down.
Get some air into it.

282
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,320
Oxygenating it opens it up.

283
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,960
It unlocks the aromas, the flavors.
Very important.

284
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,280
Smell again.

285
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,160
Ah. That's what you do
with every one of'em.

286
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,640
- Wow. When do we drink it?
- Now.

287
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,160
Mmm! Ahh.

288
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,560
- Mmm.
- How would you rate this one, Miles?

289
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,200
Well, usually they start you on wines
with learning disabilities...

290
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,120
but this one is pretty damn good.

291
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,960
- This is the new one. Right, Chris?
-Just released two months ago.

292
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,880
- Nice job.
- We like it.

293
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,120
You could work in a wine store,
Miles.

294
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,000
Mmm. Yeah.
That'd be a good move.

295
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,680
Are you chewing gum?

296
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,040
Do you think I'm making a mistake
marrying Christine?

297
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,960
Whoa!

298
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,320
Do you think I'm doing the right thing, Miles?
Tell me the truth.

299
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,640
I mean, you've been there.

300
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,480
Well, you know, I-- I think that you
waited for some good reason...

301
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,360
and that you proposed to Christine
for some good reason...

302
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,760
so I think it's great.

303
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,680
It's time.

304
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,560
I mean, you gotta have your eyes open,
that's all.

305
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,400
I mean, look at me.
I thought Victoria and I were set for life.

306
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,280
Christine's dad,
he's really been talking to me...

307
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,120
about bringing me into his property business,
showing me the ropes.

308
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,960
Which is something, considering how long
it took him to get over my not being Armenian.

309
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,880
So I'm thinking about it.

310
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,800
But I don't know.

311
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,720
Might get a little incestuous.

312
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,600
But Mike does great.
A lot of high-end commercial stuff.

313
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,000
- So you're gonna stop acting?
- No way! No.

314
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,720
This would just provide some stability.

315
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,320
I could always squeeze in a commercial
or an audition here, there.

316
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,200
Keep myself in the game in case
something really great came along.

317
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,120
We're not getting any younger, Miles.

318
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,760
No. No.

319
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,600
- Hey, hey, hey.!
- Hey.

320
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,520
- Miles!
- Sir.

321
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,920
- Long time no see.
- Gary, nice to see you.

322
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,800
- When's your novel coming out?
We all wanna read it.
- Soon, soon, soon.

323
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,680
This is my buddyJack.
He's getting married next week.

324
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,040
- My condolences, man.
- What are you pouring tonight?

325
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,960
- Uh, we have got a lot of good stuff.
- Mm-hmm?

326
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,840
Ah, we have the, uh, new Bien Nacido.
You want a taste?

327
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,760
Absolument.

328
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,640
They make their own wine here.
It's just outstanding.

329
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,600
Very special. Thank you.

330
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,400
Mmm!

331
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,840
- Mmm.
- So, what do you think?

332
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,560
Tighter than a nun's asshole.
But good concentration. Nice fruit.

333
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,920
Pour us a couple, will ya.

334
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,040
Yeah. It's tight.

335
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,440
There you are, gentlemen.

336
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,400
I will leave you the bottle.
And it is good to see you.

337
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,880
Hey, man.
Here's to my last week of freedom.

338
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,800
It's gonna be great.

339
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,800
Here's to us.

340
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,880
- Miles.
- Mm-hmm?

341
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,280
Check out that chick.

342
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,880
Oh. Yeah. That's Maya.

343
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,760
- You know her?
- Sure, I know Maya.

344
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,280
- You know that chick?
- Yes.Jack, this is where I eat
when I come up here.

345
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,520
You know?
It's practically my office.

346
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,400
And occasionally I have a drink
with the employees, yeah.

347
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,240
Maya's great.
She's worked here a year,year and a half.

348
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,160
She's incredibly hot.

349
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,400
Yes, she is.
And nice. And married.

350
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,360
Check out the rock.

351
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,280
Oh, that doesn't mean shit.

352
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,200
When Christine worked at Sushi Roku...

353
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,880
she wore a big engagement ring
to keep guys from hitting on her.

354
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,760
Think it worked? Fuck no.
How do you think I met her?

355
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,560
Well, this gal is married to some
philosophy professor at U.C. Santa Barbara.

356
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,880
What's a professor's wife doing waitressing?
Obviously that's over.

357
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,760
Jack, you don't know anything
about this woman.

358
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,840
Calm down. Let's just eat.

359
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,960
- Hey, Miles!
- Oh! Hi, Maya.

360
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,840
- How are you?
- I'm good. Good.

361
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,440
You look great.
Did you lose some weight?

362
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,000
Uh... no, actually.

363
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,840
But... thank you.

364
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,280
- Busy night, huh?
- Sunday.

365
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,200
You guys been out tasting?

366
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,400
Oh, you know it. You know it.

367
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
Oh, this is my friend,Jack.Jack, Maya.

368
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,440
- Hiya.
- Hi.

369
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,000
Well, it's good to see you. Bye, Miles.

370
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,480
Oh. Back to work.

371
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,360
-Jesus, she is jammin'.
- Yeah.

372
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,280
And she's obviously into you.

373
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,200
What else do you know about her?

374
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,360
Well, she does know a lot about wine.

375
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,240
Ah. Now we're getting somewhere.

376
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,120
- She likes pinot.
- Perfect!

377
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,560
She's a fucking waitress
in Buellton,Jack.

378
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,480
How is that ever gonna work out?

379
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,800
You dick. Why do you have to
focus on the negative?

380
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,480
- See how friendly she was to you?
- She works for tips.

381
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,040
You're blind, dude. Blind.

382
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,920
I can also recommend the ostrich steak.
Very lean. Locally raised.

383
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,800
Hey, Gary.

384
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,720
- Highliner, please.
- You got it.

385
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,640
- That's on us.
- Yes, indeed.

386
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,560
Well, hey, guys. Do you mind?

387
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,480
- Oh, no, no, no.
- You sure?

388
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,840
Please. Light up, light up.

389
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,200
In fact, would you like to join us?

390
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,600
Sure.

391
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,200
So, how's that book coming, Miles?

392
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,080
I think you were almost finished with it
the last time we talked.

393
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,320
- I finished it.
- Good for you! Wow.

394
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,240
It's getting published.

395
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,520
That's, uh, actually why
we're up here celebrating.

396
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,000
Well, congratulations.

397
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,920
- That's fantastic!
- Yeah.

398
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,920
- Cheers.
- Thanks.

399
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,880
Are you a writer too?

400
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,800
No, Maya, I'm an actor.

401
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,200
Really. What kind of stuff?

402
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,120
Mmm, a lot ofTV.

403
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,480
I used to be a regular
on a couple of series.

404
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,960
But lately it's been a lot of commercial work.
Nationals, mostly.

405
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,880
Anything I might know?

406
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,440
Perhaps. Do you recognize this?

407
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,680
Now with a low, low
5.8% A.P.R. financing!

408
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,600
That's hilarious!

409
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,480
- You sound just like one of those guys.
- Am one of those guys.

410
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,400
- You are not.
- He is.

411
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,560
Consult your doctor
before using this product.

412
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,480
Side effects may include oily discharge...

413
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,400
hives, loss of appetite,
low blood pressure.

414
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,440
If you have diabetes
or a history of kidney trouble...

415
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,360
you're dead, asshole!

416
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,280
Yeah.

417
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,440
So, what are you guys up to tonight?

418
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,560
Oh, we're pretty wiped.

419
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,480
I think we're just gonna go back
to the motel and crash.

420
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,360
Yeah, I guess it's
kind of a long drive up here.

421
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,400
- Mmm.
- Where are you staying?

422
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,360
Uh, the Windmill.

423
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,320
Windmill.

424
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,160
The girl is looking to party...

425
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,040
and you tell her we're going back
to the motel and crash?

426
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,960
-Jesus, Miles!
- Well, I'm tired,Jack.

427
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,320
- Aren't you tired?
- The chick digs you, man!

428
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,240
She lit up like a pinball machine...

429
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,640
when she found out
your novel was getting published.

430
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,040
Now I have another lie to live down.

431
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,920
- Thanks,Jack.
-Just trying to get you a little action.

432
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,320
I would appreciate a little bit of help.

433
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,680
Didn't seem to me like that's what
was going on. You were all over her.

434
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,080
Well, somebody had to do the talking.

435
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,000
And, by the way, I was right--
she's not married.

436
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,040
- How do you know?
- No rock.

437
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,640
When she came to the bar,
she was sans rock.

438
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,800
Oh.

439
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,560
What's the plan for today, Miles?

440
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,480
Aha.

441
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,040
Good. Um, we head up north--

442
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,960
Begin the grape tour up there...

443
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,880
work our way south...

444
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,800
so that the more we drink...

445
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,880
the closer we get to the motel.

446
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,960
What's your problem?

447
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,360
What is it?

448
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,320
I'm going to get my nut
on this trip, Miles...

449
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,200
and you are not gonna
fuck it up for me...

450
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,760
with all of your depression and anxiety
and neg-head downer shit.

451
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,600
Oh.

452
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,600
Well, now the cards are on the table.

453
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,560
Yes, they are.

454
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,000
- Ah.
- And I am serious. Do not fuck with me, Miles.

455
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,560
I am going to get laid before I get married
on Saturday. Do you read me?

456
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,840
Sure, big guy. Absolutely.

457
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,760
Loud and clear.
Whatever you say.

458
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,000
It's, uh,your party, evidently.

459
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,920
Why don't you just, uh--

460
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,760
Uh, yeah. Why don't you just go out,
and I'll catch a train back.

461
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,680
No, Miles!

462
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,160
Man, this is our week to get crazy.

463
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,040
We should both be cutting loose.

464
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,840
This could be our last chance.
This is our week, man.

465
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,480
It's something we should share.

466
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,560
This is our Syrah.

467
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,560
Okay.

468
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,800
- Ooh!
- Yeah? Like that?

469
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,680
That's a big one.

470
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,720
But it did sit with the skins for
about two weeks in an open-topped tank.

471
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,040
- So that would explain all the tannins, no?
- Well, it is a young wine.

472
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,560
- So as the wine ages, the tannins will dissipate.
- Right. Of course.

473
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,360
- Excuse me for just a minute.
- Good stuff.

474
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,840
Mmm. Fill up there, bub.

475
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,400
This is our estate chardonnay.

476
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,440
Now, there's a girl who knows how to pour.
What's your name?

477
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,400
Stephanie.

478
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,360
Stephanie. Nice.

479
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,960
So, what do you think?

480
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,880
Mmm. Quaffable.

481
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,120
But, uh, far from transcendent.

482
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,040
I like it. Tastes great.

483
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,960
Oak-y.

484
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,840
This is a cabernet franc.

485
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,720
This is only the fifth year
we've made this varietal.

486
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,280
Very few wineries around here
do a straight cab franc.

487
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,200
It's from our vineyards
up in Santa Maria...

488
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,080
and it was a silver medal winner...

489
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,000
at Paso Robles last year.

490
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,560
Hmm.

491
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,520
Mmm.

492
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,440
Well, I will tell you something.

493
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,720
I've come never to expect greatness from
a cab franc, and this one is no different.

494
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,600
It's kind of a hollow, flabby, overripe--

495
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,000
I don't know.
Tastes pretty good to me.

496
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,360
So, um, do you live around here,
Stephanie?

497
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,880
Yeah, up around Los Alamos.
And I agree with you about cab franc.

498
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,280
We're just over in Buellton.

499
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,200
The Windmill Inn.

500
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,120
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm.

501
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,000
Do you happen to know a gal named Maya
that works at The Hitching Post?

502
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,880
- Yeah. Sure. I know Maya. I know her real well.
- Yeah? No shit?

503
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,400
We had a drink with her last night.
Miles knows her.

504
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,320
Yes. Could we move on
to the Syrah, please?

505
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,240
Oh. Champing at the bit, huh?

506
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,240
Sure.

507
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,000
This is our estate Syrah.

508
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,800
You are a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.

509
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,760
I know. I need to be spanked.

510
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,880
Excuse me.

511
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,040
The Syrah?

512
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,360
Hey. Hey. Get the trunk.

513
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,320
- You have the keys.
- I do?

514
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,240
- Yeah.
- In my pocket.

515
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,160
- So, we're on.
- What?

516
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,120
Yeah. She called Maya, who's not working
tonight. So we're all going out.

517
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,040
- Wi-- With Maya?
- Yeah.

518
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,440
She's been divorced a year now, buddy.

519
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,360
This chick Stephanie?

520
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,240
She's got it all goin' on.

521
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,160
Well, she is cute, yeah.

522
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,080
Cute? She's a fuckin' hottie.

523
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,880
And you almost tell her that I'm gettin' married?
What's the matter with you?

524
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,200
- Nice, huh?
- It's beautiful.

525
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,280
Yeah. Victoria and I
used to like this view.

526
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,320
You know,
once we had a picnic here...

527
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,640
and we drank a '95 Opus One.

528
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,040
With smoked salmon and artichokes.
But we didn't care.

529
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,680
Oh, man, she has the best palate
of any woman I have ever known.

530
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,480
She can even differentiate
all different kinds of Italian wines.

531
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,080
Miles, there's something I gotta tell you.

532
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,240
Victoria's coming to the wedding.

533
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,600
Yeah, I know. You told me.
I'm all right with it.

534
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,160
Yeah, but that's not the whole story.

535
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,040
She got remarried.

536
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,000
She what?

537
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,480
When?

538
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,000
About a month ago.

539
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,920
Maybe six weeks.

540
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,640
To that guy--
that guy with the restaurant?

541
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,560
Miles?

542
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,520
Miles.

543
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,720
I'd like to go home now.

544
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,640
Miles, get out of the car.

545
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,080
Would you drive me
back to the motel, please?

546
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,000
You know--

547
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,400
She bringing him to the wedding?

548
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,400
What do you think?

549
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,360
Why didn't you tell me
about this before,Jack?

550
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,080
Because I knew you'd get so freaked out
that you wouldn't even come on this trip.

551
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,960
But then I thought,
this is the perfect place to tell you.

552
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,240
We're here to forget about all that shit.
We're here to party, man.

553
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,160
I'm gonna be a fucking pariah.

554
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,080
Persona non grata.

555
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,480
Everybody's gonna be holding their breath,
waiting to see if I get drunk and make a scene.

556
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,160
No, no. No. Look.

557
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,600
I talked to Victoria. Okay?

558
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,440
I talked to Victoria. Okay?

559
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,360
She's cool. Everybody's cool.

560
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,840
I'm sorry. You've been talking--

561
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,720
Behind my back...

562
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,720
you've been talking about it?

563
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,160
What are you doing?

564
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,320
Come back here.

565
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,320
Miles!

566
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,160
- Come here. Give me that bottle.
- Back off,Jack.

567
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,080
- Come on--
- Back off, man!

568
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,120
- Give me that bottle.
- No.

569
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,760
Miles.

570
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,800
Miles!

571
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,960
A lot of people
out there think they can make it.

572
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,800
What better thing in life is to chase the
dream and not be afraid of going after it?

573
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,120
James Lepp next to play.
Chance for a birdie and a five-shot lead.

574
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,840
I'm gonna go for a swim,
get the blood flowing. You wanna come?

575
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,360
No. I wanna watch this.

576
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,800
Okay.

577
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,160
Should start this ball one or two inches
outside the left edge.

578
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,240
Go in.

579
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,520
- Great putt.
- Absolutely. Great speed.

580
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,480
Miles.

581
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,520
Miles.

582
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,560
Oh, Miles. Time to get up.

583
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,120
This fuckin' chick in theJacuzzi--

584
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,040
Oh, dude!

585
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,880
This place is wide open.
I'm goin' fuckin' nuts up here, man.

586
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,440
- Hey, what should I wear?
- I don't know.

587
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,360
Something casual, but nice.
They think you're a writer.

588
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,440
Right. Okay.

589
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,480
Mmm.

590
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,800
Do you have any other shoes?

591
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,680
Uh-uh.

592
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,680
Hmm.

593
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,200
Hey, honey.

594
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,640
Yeah, I was just calling to check in.

595
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,520
Miles and I are getting ready
to go to dinner.

596
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,600
Probably stay out late, so I just thought
I'd call and say good night now.

597
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,400
Yeah. I miss you too.

598
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,360
Yeah. I love you too.

599
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,080
Just try to be your normal,
humorous self. Okay?

600
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,960
The guy you were before the tailspin.
Do you remember that guy?

601
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,880
People love that guy.

602
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,760
And don't forget--
your novel is coming out in the fall.

603
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,640
Oh. Really? How exciting.
What's it called?

604
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,640
Come here, Miles. Come here.

605
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,880
Do not sabotage me.

606
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,760
If you wanna be a fuckin' lightweight,
then that's your call.

607
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,640
- But do not sabotage me.
- Oh, aye, aye, cap'n. You got it.

608
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,520
And if they wanna drink merlot,
we're drinkin' merlot.

609
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,880
If anybody orders merlot, I'm leaving.
I am not drinking any fucking merlot!

610
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,280
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles.

611
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,200
Jesus. No merlot.

612
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,320
Did you bring your Xanax?

613
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,760
All right.

614
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,680
Come here.

615
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,240
Do not drink too much.
Do you hear me?

616
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,120
I don't want you passing out
or going to the dark side.

617
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,920
- No going to the dark side!
- Okay!

618
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,640
Hi.Just looking for some friends.

619
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,560
Good evening, ladies.
How are you?

620
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,480
- Hi, Miles.
- Good. How are you?

621
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,840
Hello, Maya.

622
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,720
- You look gorgeous. You both do.
- Thank you.

623
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,320
- You're not so bad yourself.
- Thanks. Thanks.

624
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,240
So, what's good here?

625
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,440
- What is this you're drinking?
- Oh, this is the Fiddlehead sauvignon blanc.

626
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,360
- Ah, I see. Is it good?
- Try it.

627
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,240
- What time did you close up at Ka-- Is it--
- Kalyra.

628
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,240
- Kalyra.
- I actually got out of there pretty good,
around 5:30, 6:00.

629
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,120
- Still had some stuff to do.
- Miles and I, we were--

630
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,520
- That's nice.
- It's aged 1 2 months in oak.

631
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,440
- French oak.
- Sauvignon blanc?

632
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,360
Huh. Interesting. It's good.

633
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,520
I know the winemaker.
She comes into the restaurant all the time.

634
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,600
- What do you have to do to close up?
- I close up the register.

635
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,720
Clean up, put some stuff away.
Then put the glasses out for the next day.

636
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,760
- Right.
-Just... small stuff.

637
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,680
Uh, hints of clove.

638
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,600
- Right?
- Yes! I know. I love that.

639
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,840
Yeah. Mmm.

640
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,760
Sorry. It's good.

641
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,040
- No, no. We'll get you a glass.
- Ah! Now we're thinking.

642
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,960
Good. Okay.

643
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,880
Oh, that's-- that--

644
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,600
Oh, he can say it,
and it's not disgusting?

645
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,520
I didn't hear him say that.

646
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,840
- Whenever I say something he said--
- Very good.

647
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,240
No, actually-- No. That one.
N-Not this one--

648
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,400
I'm having that too.

649
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,600
- Right?
- Oh, yes.

650
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,240
That's what I'm saying.

651
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,160
For our soup we have corn chowder...

652
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,520
and for our entrees we have medallions
of pork dusted with black truffles...

653
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,560
served with a root vegetable foulon
and wasabi whipped potatoes.

654
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,480
And finally--

655
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,360
- I have to explain my credentials.
- Yes.!

656
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,720
Miles, what does this remind you of?.

657
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,600
"Red wine. Red wine."

658
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,840
He was brought up on a lot of charges.

659
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,640
- Yeah?
- I mean, with the yellow light.

660
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,560
Right.

661
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,440
After all, tonight
we are celebrating Miles's book deal.

662
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,360
- Published author.
- Oh! Wow!

663
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,000
Wow, Miles.!

664
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,160
- Ohh.!
- Well, in that case--

665
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,080
And then they think you have no idea.
You have no control over it.

666
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,080
Ancient way of treating the grape.

667
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,120
Now it's a modern way
of treating the grape.

668
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:03,320
It's a traditional way of dealing with wine.
It's a controversial way.

669
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,960
So everyone's going back to that.

670
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,800
It's just that there's
a certain constant lapping.

671
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,680
- It's not a-- It's a fishing lake.
- Mm-hmm.

672
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,600
Your lips look soft.

673
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,400
- The whole area is--
- Oh, no. You mean, like, what it was used for?

674
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,360
What do they call the--

675
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,640
Malibu-- It's Malibu Canyon.

676
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,520
I don't know what the hell
I'm trying to say.

677
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,560
Hello?

678
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,560
Victoria?

679
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,120
Miles?

680
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,560
Well, well, well, well, well.
Victoria. How the hell are ya?

681
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,520
What-- Uh-- What's on your mind?

682
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,440
Oh, nothin'. I--

683
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,640
Just heard that you got remarried.

684
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,880
Congratulations. I, uh--

685
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,760
Boy, I didn't think you had the stomach
for another go-around.

686
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,680
Oh, Miles, you're drunk.

687
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,560
Oh,just a little local pinot,
you know.

688
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,400
A little burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune.

689
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,760
- Where are you?
- Uh, a little place in Los Olivos.

690
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,640
New owners. Cozy ambience, uh--

691
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,800
Excellent food too.
You should, uh-- You should try it.

692
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:02,000
I thought of you at the, uh,
Hitching Post last night.

693
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,640
Hello?

694
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,800
- Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
- No, it's--

695
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,640
All right, I just--
I wanted to let you know...

696
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,480
that I have decided
not to come to the wedding...

697
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:19,880
so just in case you were dreading some sort of,
you know, run-in or something like that...

698
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,840
well, you worry no more...

699
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,760
because I'm not gonna be there.

700
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,240
It's my little wedding gift
to you and what's-his-name.

701
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,520
What is his name?

702
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,560
Ken.

703
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,480
Ken! Right.

704
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,400
Ken.

705
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,320
I'm gonna hang up now, Miles.

706
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,600
No-- You know, it's just--
I-I-I heard about this...

707
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,240
for the first time, uh, today.

708
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,160
Uh, your getting remarried, that is.

709
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,480
And, uh, I was kind of taken aback.

710
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,520
Just... hard to believe.

711
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,320
I guess I thought maybe
there was still a chance...

712
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,240
for us somewhere down the road.

713
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,640
And I just, uh--

714
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,560
- Miles.
- Huh?

715
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,440
Maybe it is better
if you don't come to the wedding.

716
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,880
All righty, Vicki. Whatever you say.

717
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,880
You're the boss.

718
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,200
Huh? I don't know.

719
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,960
Welcome back.

720
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,880
Take it easy.

721
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,520
- Are you okay, Miles?
- Yes. I'm fine.

722
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,480
Thank you.

723
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,120
- Excuse us, gentlemen.
- Excuse us.

724
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,080
Sure.

725
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,400
- Mmm.
- All right.

726
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,800
Yeah. Don't take too long.

727
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,160
- All right.
- Okay. Bye, girls.

728
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,720
What the fuck?
What is up with you?

729
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,640
- You remember our little talk outside?
- Yeah--

730
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,640
- Get your shit together, Miles.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

731
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,280
Where were you?

732
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,280
Bathroom.

733
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,200
Did you drink and dial?

734
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,920
Hmm?

735
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,200
- No.
- Why do you always have to do this?

736
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,600
Victoria is gone. Gone.

737
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,000
Poof!. In the wind.

738
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,040
I mean, you are blowing a great
opportunity here with Maya.

739
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,960
Maya-- Fuckin' Maya-- She's great!

740
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,840
She's cool, she's funny, she knows wine.

741
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,200
What is this morose, come-down bullshit?

742
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,600
These girls wanna party with us.

743
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,640
Huh?

744
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,760
And what was that 1 0-minute lecture
on, what, Vouvrays?

745
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,400
Are you kidding me?
Who gives a fuck?

746
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,680
Let's just say that I'm uncomfortable
with the whole scenario.

747
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,560
Have you forgotten all the bad times
you had with Victoria...

748
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,080
how small she could make you feel?

749
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,000
Isn't that why you had the affair
with Brenda in the first place?

750
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,920
Shut up. Shut your face. Shut up.

751
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Have you even noticed
how Maya's looking at you?

752
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,880
Now, come on, man.
You've got her on the hook.

753
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,240
Reel her in.
Let's ratchet this up a notch.

754
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,880
Here. Drink some agua fria.

755
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,280
Hey!

756
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,200
- Hey!
- Mmm.

757
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,640
Ah. Well, so, uh,
shall we get some dessert?

758
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,480
Uh, well, we were thinking, um, uh,
why don't we go back to my place?

759
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,200
I've got wine, some insane cheeses,
music, whatever.

760
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,120
Yeah!

761
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,280
Waiter!

762
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,640
Come here.

763
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,560
Uh-huh.

764
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,800
- One for you, three for me.
- Mmm.

765
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,840
You sure you wanna do this?

766
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,000
- We're here!
- Hey.!

767
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,320
- Hey!
- Where were you guys?

768
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,480
Oh, we took a couple of wrong turns,
thanks to Magellan here.

769
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,520
- Hi.
- Hi.

770
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,440
- Oh, Miles.
- Yeah?

771
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,320
- Maya's in the back,just past the kitchen.
- Okay.

772
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,240
Thanks.

773
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,760
Hi.

774
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,800
Hey.

775
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,560
- Oh, has she got anything good?
- Oh,yeah.

776
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,400
Steph's way into pinots and Syrahs.

777
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,320
- Hey, Steph!
- Yeah?

778
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,040
- Can we really open anything we want?
- Yeah,yeah. Anything.

779
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,360
Uh, except the Richebourg.

780
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,760
Richebourg? She has a Richebourg?
Holy mackerel.

781
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,720
I've completely
underestimated Stephanie.

782
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,920
Oh, good Lord. Um, look at that.

783
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,960
I think... this guy's more our speed.

784
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,880
Andrew Murray.

785
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,280
Well, okay. All right.

786
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,600
So, what gems do you have
in your collection?

787
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,680
Oh, it's really not much
of a collection, you know.

788
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,560
I mean, more like a small gathering
in a cabinet.

789
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,440
No, I've never really had the wallet for that.

790
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,840
I just have to live bottle to bottle.

791
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,240
I've got things I'm saving, definitely.

792
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:21,560
I guess the star would be
a 1961 Cheval Blanc.

793
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,440
You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc,
and it's just sitting there?

794
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,360
- Yes, I do.
- Go get it.

795
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,280
- Okay.
- I'm serious! Hurry!

796
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,200
All right. I would, I would.

797
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,160
The '61 s are peaking right now, aren't they?
That's what I've read.

798
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,120
No, that's right, yeah.

799
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,000
It might be too late already.
What are you waiting for?

800
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,840
Oh, I don't know.
A special occasion with the right person.

801
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,040
- It was supposed to be for
my 1 0th wedding anniversary, but--
- Mmm.

802
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,320
You know, the day you open
a '6 1 Cheval Blanc...

803
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,280
that's the special occasion.

804
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,480
So, uh, how long
have you been into wine?

805
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,280
I got serious about seven years ago.

806
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,600
- And what was the bottle that did it?
- '88 Sassicaia.

807
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,880
- Ah.! Well, congratulations.
- Mmm.

808
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,800
- Yeah.
- That's very good.

809
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,080
- Well--
- That would do it. Yeah.

810
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,000
Hmm.

811
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,000
Mmm.

812
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,400
Oh, wow, that's nice.
That's very good.

813
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,280
We need to give it a minute,
but that's really tasty.

814
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,280
How about you?

815
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,080
I think they overdid it a little.

816
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,360
Too much alcohol.
It overwhelms the fruit.

817
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,360
Huh.

818
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,120
Yeah. Yeah.

819
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,520
I'd say you're right on the money.

820
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,920
Very good. Nice.

821
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,880
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

822
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,040
Mmm! Is that Stephanie's kid?

823
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,960
Oh. Yeah. That's Siena.

824
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,720
- Oh, she's a sweetie.
- Cute. Cute.

825
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,640
Where is she?

826
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,560
- She's at her grandmother's.
- Oh.

827
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,800
Steph's mom.
She spends a lot of time over there.

828
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,720
You got kids?

829
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,640
Uh, me? No. No.

830
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,000
No, I'd just fuck 'em up.

831
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:11,480
No, that was the one unpolluted part
of my divorce-- no kids.

832
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,400
Yeah. Same here.

833
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,320
Good.

834
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,320
Let's go in there.

835
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,240
Now, for a low, low
4.8% A.P.R. financing--

836
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,760
Looks like our friends
are really hitting it off.

837
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,160
Yeah, I would say that.

838
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,640
Yeah.

839
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,520
So, what's your novel about?

840
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,440
What's my-- Oh, brother.

841
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,800
Well, it's, uh--
it's difficult to summarize.

842
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,720
Um...

843
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,600
it starts out as a kind of
first-person narrative...

844
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,840
about a guy taking care
of his father after a stroke.

845
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,040
- Oh.
- It's kind of based on, uh, personal experience.

846
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,960
But only-- only loosely.

847
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,880
What's the title?

848
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,800
The Day After Yesterday.

849
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,200
Oh. You mean today.

850
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,600
Um... uh, yeah.
I mean, r-right. But it's more--

851
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:18,160
So it's about, like,
death and mortality, or--

852
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,720
Uh, yeah--

853
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,640
Y-- Not really.

854
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,520
I, uh-- It de-- It jumps around a lot.

855
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,360
That's what it's about, in a way.
You know what I mean?

856
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:31,240
You start to see everything
from the point of view of the father.

857
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,600
And, uh, a lot of other things happen--
parallel narratives.

858
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,520
It's kind of a mess.

859
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,400
And then, eventually,
the whole thing sort of evolves...

860
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,320
or devolves...

861
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,600
into this sort of
Robbe-Grillet mystery.

862
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,520
You know?

863
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,560
But no real resolution.

864
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,880
- Wow.
- It--

865
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,840
Well, I think it's really great
you're getting it published.

866
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,800
Really. I mean, I know how hard it is
just to write it, even.

867
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,720
Yeah.

868
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,880
I mean, like me, I've got this paper
due on Friday...

869
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,760
and I'm freaked out about it,
just like in high school.

870
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,800
- A paper, huh?
- Yeah.

871
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,720
I'm going for a master's degree
in horticulture.

872
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,080
Sorta chipping away on it.

873
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,720
- Horticulture? Really?
- Mmm.

874
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,720
I didn't even know
that there was a college here.

875
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:20,080
Well, I commute to San Luis Obispo
twice a week.

876
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,600
Horticulture? Wow.

877
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,560
So, do you want to work
in a winery or something?

878
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,080
Maybe.

879
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,120
Oh.

880
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,160
Hmm.

881
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,200
So, when can I read your book?

882
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,200
Well, I-- You know, I-- Well, I do happen
to have a manuscript in my car.

883
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,040
Um, it's not proofed or anything...

884
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,280
so it's-- it's full of typos.

885
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,840
- If you don't mind typos--
- Oh, no. Who cares?

886
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,760
I'm the queen of typos.

887
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,760
Okay.

888
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,200
Mmm.

889
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,200
Ahh.

890
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,720
You know, can I ask you
a personal question, Miles?

891
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,640
Sure.

892
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,560
Why are you so into pinot?

893
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,680
I mean, it's like a thing with you.

894
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,400
Uh... I don't know. I don't know.

895
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:47,560
Um... it's a hard grape to grow.

896
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,720
As you know. Right?

897
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,040
It's, uh-- It's thin-skinned...

898
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,760
temperamental, ripens early.

899
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,680
It's-- You know, it's not a survivor...

900
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,600
like cabernet...

901
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,520
which can just grow anywhere...

902
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,400
and thrive even when it's neglected.

903
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:08,080
No, pinot needs constant care
and attention. You know?

904
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,480
And, in fact, it can only grow...

905
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:14,320
in these really specific,
little tucked-away corners of the world.

906
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,200
And-- And only...

907
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:23,000
the most patient
and nurturing of growers...

908
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,520
can do it, really.

909
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,520
Only somebody
who really takes the time...

910
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,280
to understand pinot's potential...

911
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,160
can then coax it
into its fullest expression.

912
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,480
And then? I mean--

913
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,560
Oh, its flavors, they're just
the most haunting and brilliant...

914
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,080
and thrilling and subtle and...

915
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,960
ancient on the planet.

916
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,560
No, I mean, you know, cabernets
can be powerful and exalting too...

917
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,080
but they seem prosaic to me,
for some reason, by comparison.

918
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,440
I don't know. I don't know.

919
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,360
What about you?

920
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,280
What about me?

921
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,560
I don't know.
Why are you into wine?

922
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,880
Oh, I-- I think I--

923
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,240
- I originally got into wine through my ex-husband.
- Ah.

924
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:21,040
You know, he had this big
sort of show-off cellar.

925
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,960
- You know?
- Right.

926
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,640
- But then I discovered that
I had a really sharp palate.
- Mm-hmm.

927
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,560
And the more I drank...

928
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,480
the more I liked
what it made me think about.

929
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,400
Like what?

930
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,320
Like what a fraud he was.

931
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,520
Wow.

932
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:41,000
No, I mean, I like to think
about the life of wine.

933
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,920
Yeah.

934
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,880
How it's a living thing.

935
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,400
I like to think about...

936
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,760
what was going on the year
the grapes were growing...

937
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,080
how the sun was shining...

938
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,080
if it rained.

939
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,040
I like to think about...

940
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:02,360
all the people who tended
and picked the grapes...

941
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,760
and, if it's an old wine,
how many of them must be dead by now.

942
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:12,240
I like how wine continues to evolve.

943
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,120
Like,
if I opened a bottle of wine today...

944
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:19,080
it would taste different than if
I'd opened it on any other day.

945
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,440
Because a bottle of wine
is actually alive...

946
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:28,280
and it's constantly evolving
and gaining complexity.

947
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,200
That is, until it peaks...

948
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,160
like your '61 .

949
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,520
And then it begins its steady...

950
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,400
inevitable decline.

951
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,920
Hmm.

952
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And it tastes so fucking good.

953
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,960
Yeah.

954
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,480
But you know, I-- I, uh--

955
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,920
I like other wines besides pinot too.

956
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,600
I mean, lately
I've been really into Rieslings.

957
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,800
You like Rieslings? Rieslings?

958
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,560
Mm-hmm.

959
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,840
There's a bathroom in the back?

960
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,520
- Yeah. It's through the kitchen.
- I'll be right back.

961
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,000
God, you are such a fuckin' loser.

962
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,080
You make me so fuckin' sick.

963
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,160
Oh, God. Ah, come on.

964
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,400
Hi.

965
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,360
- I was just getting some water.
- Okay.

966
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,400
- You want some water?
- No.

967
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,960
Okay. It's getting kind of late.

968
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,840
I should really go.

969
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,200
So you know how to get to the Windmill?
Two rights and a left.

970
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,200
- Got it.
- Okay.

971
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,680
I had a nice time tonight, Miles.
I really did.

972
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,520
Good. So did I.

973
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:09,440
- Okay. Well, I'll see you around then.
- Um--

974
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,240
Did you still want to read my novel?

975
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,960
Oh, yeah. Of course.

976
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,480
Yeah.

977
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,360
- Great.
-Just a sec.

978
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,280
- Here.
- Oh, wow.

979
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,280
Well, I hope you like it.

980
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:38,920
And feel free to stop reading it any time.
I will not be offended.

981
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,040
Okay.

982
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,680
- Well, good night, Miles.
- Good night.

983
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,880
Oh, fuck.

984
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,600
Oh, fuck.

985
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:04,680
That fucking chick is unbelievable, dude.
Unbelievable!

986
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,920
Whoo! Boy.

987
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,280
Ohh, she is nasty, Miles.

988
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,320
Nasty, nasty, nasty.!

989
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,440
- Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system.
- Yeah, baby.

990
01:01:16,560 --> 01:06:34,114
Congratulations.
Mission accomplished.

991
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:25,108
Oh, hi, Miles!

992
01:01:25,213 --> 01:01:27,764
Hi.

993
01:01:27,867 --> 01:01:31,182
- Hey, you didn't invite Stephanie
to come with us, did you?

994
01:01:31,292 --> 01:01:33,178
Oh, listen, man. Change of plans.

995
01:01:33,274 --> 01:01:37,068
Stephanie's off today, so, you know,
I'm thinkin' about goin' on a hike.

996
01:01:37,178 --> 01:01:39,478
We were supposed to play golf.

997
01:01:39,577 --> 01:01:42,804
You know what? You go, man.
You go. In fact, use my clubs.

998
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:45,775
- They're brand-new.
They were a gift from Christine's dad.

999
01:01:45,881 --> 01:01:48,246
Here, I'll pay for it. Right there.

1000
01:01:48,345 --> 01:01:51,507
And then later, the three of us,
we can go to The Hitching Post.

1001
01:01:51,608 --> 01:01:53,494
We could sit at one of Maya's tables.

1002
01:01:53,593 --> 01:01:55,478
She'll bring us some great wine,
you know?

1003
01:01:55,575 --> 01:01:58,834
- Then the four of us will do something.
- No. Count me out.

1004
01:01:58,935 --> 01:02:01,138
Oh, I see.

1005
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,791
Didn't go so great last night, huh?
What a shocker.

1006
01:02:03,895 --> 01:02:07,438
You mean getting drunk and calling
Victoria didn't put you in the mood?

1007
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:11,244
Dumb fuck.

1008
01:02:11,349 --> 01:02:15,624
- Later, man.
- Yeah, well, maybe you should
check your messages first.

1009
01:02:24,628 --> 01:02:27,660
Oh, boy.

1010
01:02:27,763 --> 01:02:30,314
Yeah, she's been leaving
messages here too.

1011
01:02:31,796 --> 01:02:33,617
Yeah. Okay.

1012
01:02:33,715 --> 01:02:36,877
- You should call her.
- I will. I'll see you.

1013
01:02:36,978 --> 01:02:39,496
- Right now!
- Okay. Fuck!

1014
01:02:39,602 --> 01:02:42,666
- What are you, my mom?
- Well.

1015
01:02:50,929 --> 01:02:53,230
Would you mind waiting outside?

1016
01:02:58,383 --> 01:03:01,513
- That was fun last night.
- Yeah. Good food.

1017
01:03:01,614 --> 01:03:05,507
Hey, I-I talked to Maya this morning.
She said she had a fun time too.

1018
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,500
You should call her.

1019
01:03:15,405 --> 01:03:18,371
- Where's Jack?
- Uh, had to make a phone call.

1020
01:03:18,476 --> 01:03:20,863
Oh.

1021
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:25,032
Miles. Miles.

1022
01:03:27,339 --> 01:03:30,981
Hey, man, uh, do you have
that other condom?

1023
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:33,351
In my jacket.

1024
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:35,303
What did, uh, Christine say?

1025
01:03:35,401 --> 01:03:39,458
Lucked out. Got voice mail.
Everything's cool.

1026
01:03:39,561 --> 01:03:42,242
- Ha, ha.! Here I am.
- Hi.!

1027
01:03:48,968 --> 01:03:50,854
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1028
01:04:37,025 --> 01:04:39,925
Cannonball!

1029
01:04:40,032 --> 01:04:42,997
Please dial your password and press pound.

1030
01:04:46,625 --> 01:04:48,827
You have no messages at this time.

1031
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:51,347
To send a message, press 2--

1032
01:05:19,993 --> 01:05:23,340
Uh--

1033
01:05:23,451 --> 01:05:25,423
Not now. Not now!

1034
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:29,489
Yeah.

1035
01:05:40,249 --> 01:05:42,135
Hey, there you are.

1036
01:05:42,232 --> 01:05:44,597
- Yup.
- Hey, man.

1037
01:05:44,695 --> 01:05:46,865
What are you drinking?

1038
01:05:46,967 --> 01:05:48,853
Is it any good?

1039
01:05:49,943 --> 01:05:52,146
Can-- Can I get a glass, please?

1040
01:05:52,246 --> 01:05:55,091
Thanks.

1041
01:05:55,191 --> 01:05:58,255
Stephanie took me out
to the pinot fields today, Miles.

1042
01:05:58,357 --> 01:06:00,242
God, it was so awesome.

1043
01:06:00,341 --> 01:06:03,503
I think I'm really starting to get
a handle on the whole process.

1044
01:06:03,605 --> 01:06:06,058
The soil to the vine, and the--
what do you call it?

1045
01:06:06,164 --> 01:06:08,268
The selection to the harvest.

1046
01:06:08,372 --> 01:06:11,218
Then that thing they do with
the big containers where they mix it?

1047
01:06:11,316 --> 01:06:13,519
It's really neat, the whole thing.

1048
01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:16,170
Then we ate pinot grapes
right off the vine.

1049
01:06:16,275 --> 01:06:18,247
They were a little sour...

1050
01:06:18,354 --> 01:06:21,003
but showing excellent potential
for structure...

1051
01:06:21,106 --> 01:06:22,928
down the line, I think.

1052
01:06:23,026 --> 01:06:26,024
Stephanie, man.
She really knows her shit.

1053
01:06:26,128 --> 01:06:28,493
Hmm. Where is Stephanie?

1054
01:06:28,594 --> 01:06:32,237
Uh, she's upstairs cleaning up.

1055
01:06:32,337 --> 01:06:34,375
What the fuck are you doing?

1056
01:06:35,984 --> 01:06:39,462
- What?
- With this chick.

1057
01:06:39,567 --> 01:06:41,736
What?

1058
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:43,975
Does she know about Saturday?

1059
01:06:44,078 --> 01:06:46,443
Well, not exactly.
I've been honest with her.

1060
01:06:46,543 --> 01:06:48,428
I haven't told her I'm available.

1061
01:06:48,527 --> 01:06:50,892
She knows this trip
is only for a few days.

1062
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:53,541
Besides, I just--

1063
01:06:53,647 --> 01:06:57,703
- Besides what?
- I'm-- Well, you know--

1064
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,690
- The wedding.
- What?

1065
01:06:59,788 --> 01:07:04,488
I-- I've just been doing
some thinking about it.

1066
01:07:04,588 --> 01:07:07,270
Oh, you've been thinking. And?

1067
01:07:09,516 --> 01:07:13,790
Might have to put
the wedding on hold, is all.

1068
01:07:13,899 --> 01:07:17,213
Look, I know that
that could be tricky...

1069
01:07:17,321 --> 01:07:20,222
- for certain people to accept at first.
- Yeah.

1070
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:22,695
All right?
But life is short, Miles.

1071
01:07:22,795 --> 01:07:26,589
I have to be sure I'm doing the right thing
before taking such a big step.

1072
01:07:26,696 --> 01:07:29,061
You know what?
That's not just for my sake.

1073
01:07:29,161 --> 01:07:32,225
I'm looking out
for Christine's feelings too.

1074
01:07:32,327 --> 01:07:35,970
I mean, being with Stephanie
has completely opened my eyes.

1075
01:07:36,073 --> 01:07:38,754
She's not uptight or controlling.
She's just cool.

1076
01:07:38,856 --> 01:07:42,269
I mean, she smells different,
she tastes different.

1077
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:44,261
- She fucks different.
- Okay.

1078
01:07:44,358 --> 01:07:46,561
She fucks like an animal.

1079
01:07:46,661 --> 01:07:49,659
I gotta tell you, man.

1080
01:07:49,766 --> 01:07:52,764
I went deep last night.

1081
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:54,689
Deep.

1082
01:07:54,789 --> 01:07:57,405
Deep.

1083
01:07:57,509 --> 01:08:00,823
I thought I'd get a little understanding
from you, but I'm not gonna get that.

1084
01:08:00,932 --> 01:08:03,297
Understanding about what,Jack?

1085
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:08,858
I might be in love with another woman.

1086
01:08:08,962 --> 01:08:10,783
In love? Really?

1087
01:08:10,884 --> 01:08:14,678
Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer
chick, and you're fuckin' in love.

1088
01:08:14,786 --> 01:08:17,632
Come on! And you're gonna
give up everything?

1089
01:08:19,778 --> 01:08:21,663
Here's what I'm thinkin'.

1090
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:25,054
You and me, we move up here,
we buy a vineyard.

1091
01:08:25,151 --> 01:08:28,466
You design the wine.
I'll handle the business side.

1092
01:08:28,577 --> 01:08:31,542
You get inspired, maybe write
another novel, one that can sell.

1093
01:08:31,648 --> 01:08:33,469
Oh, my God. No, no.

1094
01:08:33,568 --> 01:08:35,869
As for me, if an audition comes up,
L.A.'s right there, man.

1095
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:38,332
- It's two hours away. Not even.
-Jesus Christ. You're crazy.

1096
01:08:38,431 --> 01:08:40,764
You've gone crazy.

1097
01:08:43,613 --> 01:08:46,458
All I know is that I'm an actor.

1098
01:08:46,558 --> 01:08:49,077
All I have is my instinct.

1099
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:53,295
You're asking me to go against it.

1100
01:08:53,405 --> 01:08:56,599
Hi, guys.!

1101
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:59,316
Hi. Hi.

1102
01:08:59,419 --> 01:09:02,264
- We should probably get going.
- Yeah.

1103
01:09:02,365 --> 01:09:04,403
Where?

1104
01:09:04,507 --> 01:09:07,352
I know where all the drivers go.

1105
01:09:07,451 --> 01:09:11,605
Huh? All right. Here comes the tricky part.
There you go. Nice.

1106
01:09:11,706 --> 01:09:14,486
Nice. Okay, it's the bridge.

1107
01:09:14,585 --> 01:09:18,260
Golden Gate Bridge. There you go.

1108
01:09:20,697 --> 01:09:23,543
You know, it's a thing-- I mean,
I've gotten over it. You know what I mean?

1109
01:09:23,641 --> 01:09:26,192
- Mm-hmm.
- Stephanie's heard this a thousand times...

1110
01:09:26,297 --> 01:09:29,491
but if I'd bought up in Santa Maria
when I had a chance...

1111
01:09:29,592 --> 01:09:32,405
I would've made a fortune
when they put in that, uh--

1112
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:34,507
- Home Depot.
- Home Depot.

1113
01:09:34,614 --> 01:09:37,329
And those stores.
And your father knew about it too.

1114
01:09:37,431 --> 01:09:39,253
He's such a fuckin' chickenshit.

1115
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:42,894
Always was.
Just a fuckin'chickenshit.

1116
01:09:42,997 --> 01:09:45,232
Just too scared.

1117
01:09:45,333 --> 01:09:48,178
- Is this bothering you? You sure?
- It's fine. Yeah.

1118
01:09:50,804 --> 01:09:53,650
Hey, man. I'm gonna just make sure
that Siena and Stephanie get home safe.

1119
01:09:53,749 --> 01:09:56,114
- Okay.
- All right. Maybe we'll hook up with you later.

1120
01:09:56,211 --> 01:09:58,576
Sure. Whatever. Maybe I'll
go catch a movie or something.

1121
01:09:58,675 --> 01:10:01,424
- See you later, Miles.
- Thanks, Stephanie. See you.

1122
01:10:01,523 --> 01:10:03,345
- Bye, Siena.
- Bye.

1123
01:10:03,443 --> 01:10:05,744
- Caryl, very nice meeting you.
- I loved talking with you.

1124
01:10:05,841 --> 01:10:09,548
- Thanks.
- If you go out later, call me on my cell.

1125
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:12,169
Okay!

1126
01:10:23,311 --> 01:10:25,829
- Okay. That's it?
- Yeah.

1127
01:10:25,937 --> 01:10:29,547
Actually, could I get a, uh--
a Barely Legal, please?

1128
01:10:29,647 --> 01:10:33,060
Thank you. No, actually--
Sorry. The new one.

1129
01:10:33,165 --> 01:10:34,986
Okay.

1130
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:37,964
Thanks.

1131
01:10:57,322 --> 01:10:59,841
What-- Oh.

1132
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:49,015
- Hey, Miles. How's it hanging?
- Hey.

1133
01:11:49,123 --> 01:11:52,088
Oh, you know me. I love it up here.

1134
01:11:52,196 --> 01:11:55,041
- How 'bout you?
- Busy for a Tuesday night.

1135
01:11:55,139 --> 01:11:57,755
We had a busload of old folks
on a wine tour.

1136
01:11:57,858 --> 01:12:00,703
Usually they're not too rowdy,
but tonight something was going on.

1137
01:12:00,802 --> 01:12:03,648
I don't know. A full moon or something.
Anyway, what can I get you?

1138
01:12:03,744 --> 01:12:06,361
- Highliner.
- Glass or bottle?

1139
01:12:06,465 --> 01:12:09,529
- Bottle.
- You got it.

1140
01:12:09,634 --> 01:12:11,837
Say, is, uh, Maya working?

1141
01:12:11,937 --> 01:12:15,099
Maya? Uh, no, I haven't seen her.

1142
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,403
I think she's off tonight.

1143
01:12:28,926 --> 01:12:31,771
- You okay, Miles?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1144
01:13:08,025 --> 01:13:10,674
Ah, crap.

1145
01:13:10,777 --> 01:13:13,393
- Did you ever get ahold of Maya yesterday?
- Nope.

1146
01:13:13,495 --> 01:13:15,317
- Hmm?
- No.

1147
01:13:15,417 --> 01:13:17,968
She really likes you, man.
Stephanie'll tell you.

1148
01:13:18,071 --> 01:13:20,589
- Could you just give me a little room? Please?
- Yeah.

1149
01:13:20,694 --> 01:13:22,515
Thank you.

1150
01:13:22,614 --> 01:13:25,928
In life, you gotta strike
while the iron's hot. Iron is hot.

1151
01:13:26,038 --> 01:13:28,556
Sage advice,Jack.

1152
01:13:28,662 --> 01:13:31,278
- Now, remember, sit back on your heels.
- Mm-hmm.

1153
01:13:31,381 --> 01:13:34,608
All right?
Turn through the abdomen.

1154
01:13:34,709 --> 01:13:37,074
Abdomen.

1155
01:13:37,173 --> 01:13:39,692
- Oh, for cryin'--
- Nice.

1156
01:13:39,795 --> 01:13:42,160
What about your agent?
You hear anything yet?

1157
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:45,073
- Nope.
- What do you think's going on?

1158
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:48,016
- Could be anything.
- You been checking your messages?

1159
01:13:48,114 --> 01:13:50,665
- Obsessively.
- Huh.

1160
01:13:50,771 --> 01:13:53,672
Guess I'll just have to learn to kiss off
another three years of my life.

1161
01:13:53,778 --> 01:13:55,881
But you haven't heard anything yet...

1162
01:13:55,986 --> 01:13:59,399
so don't you think your negativity's
a little premature?

1163
01:13:59,505 --> 01:14:03,245
Hmm? All right. You know,
fuck the New York publishers.

1164
01:14:03,344 --> 01:14:05,709
Publish it yourself, Miles.
I'll chip in.

1165
01:14:05,807 --> 01:14:08,522
Just get it out there.
Get it reviewed.

1166
01:14:08,625 --> 01:14:11,787
Get it in libraries.
Let the public decide.

1167
01:14:17,455 --> 01:14:19,395
Don't come over the top.

1168
01:14:19,501 --> 01:14:21,605
- Stay still.
- Shut up.

1169
01:14:22,668 --> 01:14:25,154
It's all about stillness.

1170
01:14:25,262 --> 01:14:28,556
- Inner quiet.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!

1171
01:14:28,653 --> 01:14:31,334
Jesus Christ, man!
What the hell is wrong with you?

1172
01:14:31,437 --> 01:14:35,112
Please,just shut up! Fuck!

1173
01:14:35,211 --> 01:14:37,414
- God.
- What's with the hostility, man?

1174
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:39,968
I know you're a little frustrated
with your life right now...

1175
01:14:40,077 --> 01:14:43,686
but you can choose to be less hostile.

1176
01:14:47,177 --> 01:14:49,564
The fucker hit into us.

1177
01:14:49,675 --> 01:14:52,226
Hurry it up, will ya?

1178
01:14:52,329 --> 01:14:55,524
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

1179
01:14:55,625 --> 01:14:59,168
Hey, that's not cool, asshole!

1180
01:15:10,630 --> 01:15:13,475
Nice shot.Jackoffs.

1181
01:15:13,574 --> 01:15:17,565
- What the hell are you doing?
- Oops. Look out.

1182
01:15:18,982 --> 01:15:21,631
Uh? Uh-huh.

1183
01:15:21,732 --> 01:15:25,211
Oh. Oh, check it out.

1184
01:15:25,316 --> 01:15:28,478
- This is gonna be fun. This is gonna be fun.
- Go to it.

1185
01:15:37,027 --> 01:15:40,342
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool, smart
chicks like that require persistence.

1186
01:15:40,451 --> 01:15:42,816
I don't wanna talk about it, please.

1187
01:15:42,915 --> 01:15:45,433
All I know is that she's beautiful,
a lot of soul.

1188
01:15:45,537 --> 01:15:47,422
She's perfect for you.

1189
01:15:47,521 --> 01:15:50,650
I'm just not gonna feel good about this week
until I know you guys have hooked up.

1190
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:54,330
Don't you want to feel that cozy little box
grip down on your johnson?

1191
01:15:54,433 --> 01:15:57,181
Hey! Mind keeping it down, buddy?

1192
01:15:57,281 --> 01:15:59,549
A woman finds out how I live...

1193
01:15:59,647 --> 01:16:02,874
that I'm not a published author,
that I'm a liar, essentially...

1194
01:16:02,974 --> 01:16:06,387
any interest she has
is gonna evaporate real quick.

1195
01:16:06,496 --> 01:16:09,974
If you don't have money at my age,
you're not even in the game anymore.

1196
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:13,524
You're just a pasture animal
waiting for the abattoir.

1197
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:17,424
- Abattoir. What is that?
- Slaughterhouse.

1198
01:16:17,533 --> 01:16:20,433
Abattoir. Huh.
But you know what?

1199
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:22,425
You are gonna be
a published author...

1200
01:16:22,525 --> 01:16:25,622
because you're gonna get the good news
this week about your book.

1201
01:16:25,724 --> 01:16:29,170
I know you are. I can feel it.

1202
01:16:29,275 --> 01:16:31,096
Huh. Stephanie.

1203
01:16:31,195 --> 01:16:33,844
Hey, honey. Yeah.

1204
01:16:33,946 --> 01:16:36,311
Yeah. Yeah.

1205
01:16:36,410 --> 01:16:38,231
Yeah!

1206
01:16:42,713 --> 01:16:44,653
- Hey.
- Hi.

1207
01:16:49,401 --> 01:16:52,977
Hey, Miles. I heard you stopped by
the restaurant to see me last night.

1208
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,316
Oh, yeah. No. I mean, uh, yeah.

1209
01:16:55,417 --> 01:16:57,936
I stopped by for a drink.
I didn't see you.

1210
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,861
- I had class.
- Oh.

1211
01:16:59,959 --> 01:17:02,478
Well, nice to see you now.

1212
01:17:02,582 --> 01:17:04,468
It's good to see you too.

1213
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:15,534
Syrah.

1214
01:17:15,638 --> 01:17:19,280
Oldest Syrah grapes
in Santa Barbara County.

1215
01:17:19,381 --> 01:17:22,412
Did you know that?

1216
01:17:22,517 --> 01:17:24,457
You didn't know that?

1217
01:17:26,483 --> 01:17:29,449
The pinot noir grape
has been cultivated perhaps...

1218
01:17:29,556 --> 01:17:32,783
since antiquity in Burgundy.

1219
01:17:32,883 --> 01:17:35,467
And it is precisely this ancient...

1220
01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:38,700
and inherited winemaking
knowledge...

1221
01:17:38,802 --> 01:17:41,256
that has contributed to its success.

1222
01:18:42,025 --> 01:18:44,261
- I was, like, 1 6, 1 7.
- Really?

1223
01:18:44,359 --> 01:18:46,397
Yeah. I'm gonna die!

1224
01:18:46,505 --> 01:18:48,837
- Oh, God. What a drag.
- Mom?

1225
01:18:48,936 --> 01:18:50,757
- Oh.
- Oh, hey. Hi.

1226
01:18:50,855 --> 01:18:53,700
Is it too loud?

1227
01:18:53,798 --> 01:18:57,277
Sorry. Oh, UncleJack
will put you back to bed.

1228
01:18:57,383 --> 01:18:59,269
Come here, little sister. Ooh!

1229
01:18:59,366 --> 01:19:02,212
We'll be more quiet, okay?

1230
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:06,104
- Good night. I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

1231
01:19:06,213 --> 01:19:09,472
My favorite, as far as ice cream--

1232
01:19:09,572 --> 01:19:10,211
- Chunky Monkey.
- Chunky Monkey.!

1233
01:19:10,213 --> 01:19:12,416
- Chunky Monkey.
- Chunky Monkey.!

1234
01:21:30,258 --> 01:21:33,256
You guys should come by
the restaurant for lunch today.

1235
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,675
- Great. What's the latest we can get there?
- About 2:30.

1236
01:21:39,662 --> 01:21:42,344
Did you hear about this Bordeaux
tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara...

1237
01:21:42,445 --> 01:21:44,267
on Saturday night?

1238
01:21:44,367 --> 01:21:48,326
It's kind of pricey,
but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it.

1239
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:50,795
Why don't you just stay
for the weekend?

1240
01:21:50,894 --> 01:21:53,958
No, we have to get back Friday
for the rehearsal dinner.

1241
01:21:54,061 --> 01:21:55,947
What rehearsal dinner?

1242
01:21:57,292 --> 01:21:59,114
Who's getting married?

1243
01:21:59,211 --> 01:22:03,203
- Were you ever gonna say anything?
- Yes, of course I was.

1244
01:22:03,308 --> 01:22:05,673
Just now I could've told you
some story, but I didn't.

1245
01:22:05,772 --> 01:22:09,479
- I told you the truth. Maya!
- Don't touch me!

1246
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:11,465
Just take me home.

1247
01:22:13,001 --> 01:22:15,421
Do you have any idea
what he's been saying to her?

1248
01:22:15,529 --> 01:22:19,073
- He's an actor, so it can't be good.
- Only that he loves her.

1249
01:22:19,179 --> 01:22:23,138
How she's the only woman that's ever
rocked his world, how he adores Siena...

1250
01:22:23,241 --> 01:22:27,363
how he wants to move here and
get a place with the two of them
and commute when he has to.

1251
01:22:27,465 --> 01:22:30,081
I'm sure he believed every word of it.

1252
01:22:30,184 --> 01:22:32,419
Please believe me.

1253
01:22:32,519 --> 01:22:35,299
I was on the verge
of telling you last night, but--

1254
01:22:35,401 --> 01:22:38,366
But you wanted to fuck me first.

1255
01:22:39,463 --> 01:22:42,145
Oh, Maya. No.

1256
01:22:42,246 --> 01:22:44,068
Yeah.

1257
01:22:54,757 --> 01:22:58,203
You know, I've just spent
the last three years of my life...

1258
01:22:58,308 --> 01:23:02,398
trying to extricate myself from
a relationship that was full of deception...

1259
01:23:02,499 --> 01:23:04,385
and I'm doing just fine.

1260
01:23:06,178 --> 01:23:10,617
And I haven't been with anybody
since my divorce...

1261
01:23:10,724 --> 01:23:13,570
so this has been a big deal for me,
Maya.

1262
01:23:13,666 --> 01:23:17,756
Hanging out with you and, uh--
and last night.

1263
01:23:17,858 --> 01:23:21,053
I really like you, Maya...

1264
01:23:21,153 --> 01:23:24,467
and I am notJack.

1265
01:23:24,577 --> 01:23:27,422
I'm-- I'm--

1266
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:31,544
I'm his freshman year roommate
from San Diego State.

1267
01:23:55,612 --> 01:23:58,457
There's my boy!

1268
01:23:58,554 --> 01:24:01,400
There he is.
But who's your daddy?

1269
01:24:01,501 --> 01:24:04,182
- Who is your daddy? Oh!
-Jack, come on.

1270
01:24:04,284 --> 01:24:06,737
- Oh, let me love you.
- Let go. Oh!

1271
01:24:06,842 --> 01:24:09,524
Let me down,Jack.

1272
01:24:09,626 --> 01:24:12,472
I am so proud of you.
Ah. Mmm. Mmm.

1273
01:24:12,570 --> 01:24:15,056
- Well, that's nice.
- Okay. All right. Details.

1274
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:17,973
- I love details.
- No.

1275
01:24:18,074 --> 01:24:21,780
- What?
-Jesus. It's private.

1276
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:24,878
You better tell me what happened,
or I'll tie your dick in a knot.

1277
01:24:24,985 --> 01:24:28,146
Let's just leave it, okay?

1278
01:24:28,247 --> 01:24:32,522
You didn't get any, did you?

1279
01:24:32,631 --> 01:24:35,629
- You're a homo.
- Yeah, right. Yup, I'm a homo.

1280
01:24:35,735 --> 01:24:37,557
Yeah. Yeah.

1281
01:24:37,654 --> 01:24:40,751
Just make up whatever you want,
and that's what happened.

1282
01:24:40,854 --> 01:24:43,699
Write out my gay confession,
and I'll sign it.

1283
01:24:43,798 --> 01:24:47,309
Okay? Just stop pushing me
all the time.

1284
01:24:47,413 --> 01:24:49,385
You're an infant,Jack.

1285
01:24:49,492 --> 01:24:52,686
- This is all a big party for you...
- Okay.

1286
01:24:52,789 --> 01:24:55,025
- but not for me.
- Come on.

1287
01:24:55,123 --> 01:24:57,009
I'm sorry, man.

1288
01:24:58,451 --> 01:25:00,752
Did you have trouble performing?

1289
01:25:02,706 --> 01:25:06,120
Yeah, that's it.

1290
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:09,072
Don't answer it.

1291
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:10,992
Don't answer it.

1292
01:25:11,089 --> 01:25:14,348
- Jack.
- Hello.

1293
01:25:14,449 --> 01:25:17,098
Yeah.

1294
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,403
Uh-huh. It's Christine.

1295
01:25:19,504 --> 01:25:23,626
Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh.

1296
01:25:23,727 --> 01:25:25,612
Hey, let me call you right back.

1297
01:25:25,713 --> 01:25:28,297
Miles and I are kinda
in the middle of something.

1298
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:32,707
Nah, it's nothing serious.Just--
He's having one ofhis freak-outs. Yeah.

1299
01:25:32,815 --> 01:25:36,424
I love you too. I'll call you back.

1300
01:25:36,525 --> 01:25:40,582
This whole week has gone sour.
It hasn't gone the way it was supposed to.

1301
01:25:40,684 --> 01:25:43,781
I just want to go home.

1302
01:25:45,101 --> 01:25:47,083
I know what you need.

1303
01:25:47,085 --> 01:25:47,750
I know what you need.

1304
01:25:47,852 --> 01:25:50,217
How 'bout this one?
We didn't hit this one.

1305
01:25:50,317 --> 01:25:52,770
- Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
- You ever actually been in there?

1306
01:25:52,875 --> 01:25:56,997
- I don't have to.
- I say we check it out. We're right here.

1307
01:26:30,502 --> 01:26:33,020
It tastes like the back
of a fucking L.A. school bus.

1308
01:26:33,126 --> 01:26:35,458
Now, they probably didn't de-stem...

1309
01:26:35,558 --> 01:26:37,923
hoping for some semblance
of concentration.

1310
01:26:38,021 --> 01:26:40,224
Crushed it up with leaves and mice...

1311
01:26:40,325 --> 01:26:43,968
and then wound up with this rancid tar
and turpentine mouthwash bullshit.

1312
01:26:44,068 --> 01:26:45,954
Fuckin' Raid.

1313
01:26:47,427 --> 01:26:49,334
Tastes pretty good to me.

1314
01:26:49,444 --> 01:26:52,442
Hmm. Look.
They have a reserve pinot.

1315
01:26:52,547 --> 01:26:55,196
- Let me use your phone.
- What's up?

1316
01:26:55,299 --> 01:26:58,493
- I can't take it anymore. I gotta call Evelyn.
- Okay.

1317
01:27:02,114 --> 01:27:03,999
Evelyn Berman-Silverman's office.

1318
01:27:04,096 --> 01:27:06,964
- Hi,Jennifer. It's Miles again.
- Oh, hi, Miles.

1319
01:27:07,075 --> 01:27:08,896
- Hi.
- Let me see if I can get her.

1320
01:27:08,993 --> 01:27:10,878
Okay.

1321
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:14,138
- You're in luck. I'll put you through.
- Okay.

1322
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:18,742
- Hi, Miles.
- Hi, Evelyn.

1323
01:27:18,846 --> 01:27:20,667
It's your favorite client.

1324
01:27:20,766 --> 01:27:23,284
- How's the trip?
- Oh, it's good, it's good.

1325
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:25,976
You know, we're drinking
some good wines, kicking back.

1326
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:28,444
- It's very nice.
- Right.

1327
01:27:28,542 --> 01:27:31,093
So what's happening?
There's still no word, huh?

1328
01:27:31,198 --> 01:27:33,105
Well, actually, there is word.

1329
01:27:33,213 --> 01:27:35,578
I spoke to Keith Kurtzman
this morning.

1330
01:27:35,676 --> 01:27:37,497
Right. And?

1331
01:27:37,596 --> 01:27:40,016
And... they're passing.

1332
01:27:41,629 --> 01:27:45,784
Conundrum's passing.
He said they really liked it.

1333
01:27:45,883 --> 01:27:49,776
They really wanted to do it, but they just
couldn't figure out how to market it.

1334
01:27:49,883 --> 01:27:52,816
He said it was a really tough call.

1335
01:27:54,330 --> 01:27:56,151
Oh. Right.

1336
01:27:56,249 --> 01:27:58,767
I'm sorry, Miles.

1337
01:27:58,874 --> 01:28:00,978
So I don't know where that leaves us.

1338
01:28:01,081 --> 01:28:05,454
I'm not sure how much more mileage
I can get out of continuing to submit it.

1339
01:28:05,561 --> 01:28:09,487
I think it's one of those unfortunate cases
in the business right now--

1340
01:28:09,592 --> 01:28:13,452
a-a fabulous book with no home.

1341
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:16,176
The whole industry's gotten gutless.

1342
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:18,831
It's not about the quality
of the books anymore.

1343
01:28:18,935 --> 01:28:21,038
It's only about the marketing.

1344
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:28,976
- Excuse me. Could I get
a, uh, pour down here, please?
- Sure.

1345
01:28:29,077 --> 01:28:32,848
There's a, uh, special
on the Syrah by the case.

1346
01:28:34,038 --> 01:28:35,923
Hit me again.

1347
01:28:39,796 --> 01:28:41,681
Thanks.

1348
01:28:43,059 --> 01:28:45,424
Excuse me.
Could you just pour me a full glass?

1349
01:28:45,523 --> 01:28:47,409
I'll pay for it, okay?

1350
01:28:48,947 --> 01:28:52,174
Sir, this is a winery, not a bar.

1351
01:28:52,274 --> 01:28:54,312
Oh. Come on.

1352
01:28:54,418 --> 01:28:56,904
Just give me a full goddamn pour.

1353
01:28:58,546 --> 01:29:00,551
Excuse me.

1354
01:29:00,657 --> 01:29:03,971
Why don't you buy a bottle,
then go outside?

1355
01:29:07,249 --> 01:29:10,095
- What are you doing?
- I told you I need a drink,
so I'm going to help myself.

1356
01:29:10,191 --> 01:29:12,491
- Okay, pal? What do you think?
- Put the glass down.

1357
01:29:12,590 --> 01:29:14,955
Let go of the fucking glass, fucker!

1358
01:29:20,749 --> 01:29:23,300
Mmm.

1359
01:29:23,406 --> 01:29:27,528
- That's that.
- Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho, buddy. Ho, buddy.

1360
01:29:27,629 --> 01:29:29,514
- It's okay.
- Get him out ofhere.

1361
01:29:29,613 --> 01:29:33,255
- Thanks a lot!
- It's okay. His, uh-- His mother just died.

1362
01:29:37,099 --> 01:29:39,945
So you'll write another one.
You've got lots of ideas, right?

1363
01:29:40,045 --> 01:29:42,498
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer.

1364
01:29:42,603 --> 01:29:45,023
I'm a middle school English teacher.

1365
01:29:46,411 --> 01:29:48,776
Ah, the world doesn't give a shit
what I have to say.

1366
01:29:48,874 --> 01:29:51,720
I'm unnecessary.

1367
01:29:51,818 --> 01:29:55,460
I'm so insignificant,
I can't even kill myself.

1368
01:29:55,561 --> 01:29:57,926
Miles, what the hell
is that supposed to mean?

1369
01:29:58,026 --> 01:29:59,847
Come on, man. You know.

1370
01:29:59,946 --> 01:30:02,977
Hemingway, Sexton, Plath, Woolf.

1371
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:05,925
You can't kill yourself
before you've even been published.

1372
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:12,129
- What about the guy that wrote
Confederacy Of Dunces?

1373
01:30:12,231 --> 01:30:16,571
He committed suicide before he
was published. Look how famous he is.

1374
01:30:18,341 --> 01:30:20,162
Thanks.

1375
01:30:22,565 --> 01:30:27,168
Just don't give up. All right?
You're gonna make it.

1376
01:30:27,269 --> 01:30:29,688
Half my life is over...

1377
01:30:29,797 --> 01:30:33,591
and I have nothing
to show for it, nothing.

1378
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:36,993
I'm a thumbprint
on the window of a skyscraper.

1379
01:30:37,091 --> 01:30:40,885
I'm a smudge of excrement
on a tissue...

1380
01:30:40,994 --> 01:30:44,953
surging out to sea
with a million tons of raw sewage.

1381
01:30:45,057 --> 01:30:47,641
See? Right there.

1382
01:30:47,746 --> 01:30:50,166
Just what you just said?
That is beautiful.

1383
01:30:50,273 --> 01:30:53,752
"A smudge of excrement
surging out to sea."

1384
01:30:53,856 --> 01:30:56,854
- Yeah.
- I could never write that.

1385
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:59,806
Neither could I, actually.
I think it's Bukowski.

1386
01:31:23,294 --> 01:31:27,253
Hey, baby.

1387
01:31:28,668 --> 01:31:31,033
- Look what I got for our favorite girl.
- Motherfucker!

1388
01:31:31,132 --> 01:31:35,570
-Jesus Christ!
- You fucking lying piece of shit!

1389
01:31:35,674 --> 01:31:39,600
You're getting married on Saturday?
What's with all that shit you said to me?

1390
01:31:39,707 --> 01:31:42,072
- Stephanie, stop!
- I can explain.!

1391
01:31:42,170 --> 01:31:44,688
- You said you loved me!
- I do.!

1392
01:31:44,793 --> 01:31:47,824
- I hope you die!
- Stop it, Stephanie!

1393
01:31:55,544 --> 01:31:58,958
Fuckface! You too!

1394
01:31:59,063 --> 01:32:00,490
Me?

1395
01:32:02,775 --> 01:32:05,326
- You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
- No, I did not.

1396
01:32:05,431 --> 01:32:07,317
No, I did not.

1397
01:32:07,413 --> 01:32:09,746
It must have been Gary
at The Hitching Post.

1398
01:32:09,845 --> 01:32:12,210
I think we mentioned it to him
the first night.

1399
01:32:12,311 --> 01:32:15,725
Oh, did we mention it?
You mentioned it, asshole!

1400
01:32:15,829 --> 01:32:18,315
I'm fucking hurting over here.

1401
01:32:18,421 --> 01:32:20,329
Keep it elevated.

1402
01:32:24,947 --> 01:32:28,741
No, I don't want anything.

1403
01:32:33,266 --> 01:32:35,403
Uh, it's Miles.

1404
01:32:35,506 --> 01:32:40,260
I had to call and, uh, tell you again...

1405
01:32:40,369 --> 01:32:42,572
how much I enjoyed
our time together...

1406
01:32:42,673 --> 01:32:45,485
and, uh, how sorry I am...

1407
01:32:45,586 --> 01:32:48,432
that things turned out
the way they did.

1408
01:32:49,968 --> 01:32:53,610
I think you're great, Maya.

1409
01:32:53,712 --> 01:32:57,506
Uh, I always have from the first time
that you, uh, waited on me.

1410
01:32:59,886 --> 01:33:03,114
Uh, and while I'm at it...

1411
01:33:03,215 --> 01:33:06,726
uh, I guess maybe you
should know that my book...

1412
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:09,959
is not getting published.

1413
01:33:10,062 --> 01:33:13,856
I thought this one, uh, had a chance,
but I was wrong again.

1414
01:33:15,116 --> 01:33:17,602
Once again.

1415
01:33:17,707 --> 01:33:20,356
So you see, uh...

1416
01:33:20,461 --> 01:33:23,459
I'm not really much of a writer.

1417
01:33:23,564 --> 01:33:26,410
I am not much of anything, really.

1418
01:33:37,866 --> 01:33:41,660
I'm gonna have to have an operation,
maybe even a couple of'em.

1419
01:33:41,769 --> 01:33:44,931
They're gonna wait for my nose to heal first,
then they break it again.

1420
01:33:45,032 --> 01:33:48,096
Oh, Christ. Good thing
you have a voice-over career.

1421
01:33:48,199 --> 01:33:51,743
It's gonna fuck that up too.
I oughta sue her ass.

1422
01:33:51,847 --> 01:33:54,234
The only reason I won't
is to protect Christine.

1423
01:33:54,344 --> 01:33:56,480
- That's thoughtful.
- Yeah.

1424
01:34:00,421 --> 01:34:02,874
How did Stephanie know
it was on Saturday?

1425
01:34:02,983 --> 01:34:05,186
We didn't get into that with Gary.

1426
01:34:07,013 --> 01:34:10,078
Huh. That's-- Yeah, let me think.

1427
01:34:10,181 --> 01:34:14,620
- You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
- Yes, I'm sure I'm sure.

1428
01:34:14,724 --> 01:34:17,624
And just what are you implying,Jack?

1429
01:34:17,732 --> 01:34:21,243
I'm really pissed off at you about all this,
if you want to know the truth.

1430
01:34:21,347 --> 01:34:25,240
What is Maya going to think of me now,
just for associating with you?

1431
01:34:28,643 --> 01:34:32,023
I don't know. Sure seems fishy.

1432
01:34:32,131 --> 01:34:34,071
Well.

1433
01:34:34,176 --> 01:34:38,483
Wherever there's a fight
so hungry people can eat...

1434
01:34:38,594 --> 01:34:40,632
I'll be there.

1435
01:34:40,736 --> 01:34:43,800
Wherever there's a cop
beating up a guy...

1436
01:34:43,905 --> 01:34:46,620
I'll be there.

1437
01:34:46,721 --> 01:34:50,035
I'll be in the way guys yell
when they're mad.

1438
01:34:50,143 --> 01:34:52,029
What's this look like to you?

1439
01:34:53,567 --> 01:34:56,794
Uh, it looks like you were
in a bad car accident.

1440
01:34:56,894 --> 01:35:01,878
When the people
are eating the stuff they raised--

1441
01:35:01,983 --> 01:35:04,315
I'm hungry.

1442
01:35:07,612 --> 01:35:10,261
Here we go.

1443
01:35:10,365 --> 01:35:13,178
- Nice.
- Thank you.

1444
01:35:13,275 --> 01:35:16,656
- And here is your Handi Wipes.
- Oh.

1445
01:35:16,763 --> 01:35:21,168
So that's what those are. For a minute
I thought you were promoting safe sex.

1446
01:35:21,275 --> 01:35:24,088
That's a good one.
I'll have to remember that one.

1447
01:35:24,185 --> 01:35:27,250
- I'll be right back with your corn bread.
- All righty.

1448
01:35:30,681 --> 01:35:33,046
Bet you that chick's two tons of fun.

1449
01:35:33,145 --> 01:35:35,663
- You know, the grateful type?
- Mm-mmm.

1450
01:35:35,770 --> 01:35:38,038
I don't know.
I wouldn't know about that.

1451
01:35:41,559 --> 01:35:43,445
Mmm.

1452
01:35:44,696 --> 01:35:46,517
- Hmm.
- Here you go.

1453
01:35:48,182 --> 01:35:50,765
Nice technique there... Cammi.

1454
01:35:50,869 --> 01:35:53,714
Thank you. All in the wrist.

1455
01:35:53,815 --> 01:35:56,496
You know,
you look really familiar to me.

1456
01:35:56,598 --> 01:35:59,695
- Are you from around here?
- Actually, we're from San Diego. Why?

1457
01:35:59,798 --> 01:36:03,179
I don't know.
You just seemed really familiar to me.

1458
01:36:03,284 --> 01:36:06,380
- Never mind. Enjoy your meal.
- Hang on. Hang on.

1459
01:36:06,484 --> 01:36:10,060
Um, did you ever know
a Derek Sommersby?

1460
01:36:10,165 --> 01:36:14,287
Dr. Derek Sommersby
from One Life To Live?

1461
01:36:15,635 --> 01:36:19,822
Just have to imagine him
with a bandage and shorter hair.

1462
01:36:23,377 --> 01:36:26,092
No way!

1463
01:36:26,194 --> 01:36:28,810
No way! Oh, my gosh!

1464
01:36:28,913 --> 01:36:32,685
That's great.! Oh, my goodness.!

1465
01:36:32,785 --> 01:36:35,150
Could you tell me where
the bathroom is, please?

1466
01:36:35,248 --> 01:36:38,727
Oh, yeah. It's right over there,
right past the buffalo. Wow!

1467
01:36:38,832 --> 01:36:42,692
Oh, my gosh. I can't believe
you're sitting at my table.

1468
01:37:07,147 --> 01:37:10,244
Listen, man, Cammi gets off
in an hour, so I was thinking...

1469
01:37:10,346 --> 01:37:13,192
I'd just hang around, have a drink.

1470
01:37:13,291 --> 01:37:16,704
You know, make sure she gets home safe.

1471
01:37:16,811 --> 01:37:19,592
You're joking, right?

1472
01:37:19,690 --> 01:37:22,110
No.

1473
01:37:22,217 --> 01:37:24,039
Un-fucking-believable.

1474
01:37:24,137 --> 01:37:29,350
Can't we just go back to the motel
and hang out...

1475
01:37:29,449 --> 01:37:32,381
get up early,
play nine holes of golf...

1476
01:37:32,488 --> 01:37:34,373
before we head home?

1477
01:37:38,118 --> 01:37:40,964
Listen, man, you're my friend...

1478
01:37:41,063 --> 01:37:43,908
and I know you care about me.

1479
01:37:44,007 --> 01:37:46,558
I know you disapprove,
and I respect that.

1480
01:37:46,661 --> 01:37:51,132
But there are some things that I have to do
that you don't understand.

1481
01:37:51,239 --> 01:37:55,841
You understand literature,
movies, wine...

1482
01:37:55,941 --> 01:37:58,306
but you don't understand my plight.

1483
01:38:16,994 --> 01:38:19,480
Yeah?

1484
01:38:19,585 --> 01:38:22,780
- Holy shit!Jesus Christ!
- Fuck. Fuck.

1485
01:38:22,881 --> 01:38:26,010
God, it's fucking freezing out there!

1486
01:38:26,113 --> 01:38:28,959
- God, yeah.
- Vicodin. Where's the Vicodin?

1487
01:38:29,056 --> 01:38:30,941
Uh--

1488
01:38:33,408 --> 01:38:36,275
Oh.

1489
01:38:36,383 --> 01:38:38,204
Here.

1490
01:38:38,302 --> 01:38:40,123
Oh. Oh.

1491
01:38:43,486 --> 01:38:45,689
Fucking chick's married, man.

1492
01:38:45,790 --> 01:38:47,993
What?

1493
01:38:48,093 --> 01:38:50,480
Her husband works the night shift, and he
comes home and catches me on the floor...

1494
01:38:50,590 --> 01:38:52,595
with my cock in his wife's ass.

1495
01:38:52,701 --> 01:38:56,495
Oh,Jesus Christ.Jesus.Jack!

1496
01:38:56,604 --> 01:38:59,799
- And you walked all the way from Solvang?
- No, ran.

1497
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:01,786
Twisted my ankle too.

1498
01:39:01,883 --> 01:39:04,947
- That's five klicks,Jack.
- Fuckin'-A right, it's five klicks.

1499
01:39:05,051 --> 01:39:08,017
At one point I had to cut
through an ostrich farm.

1500
01:39:08,123 --> 01:39:11,285
Those fuckers are mean.

1501
01:39:17,530 --> 01:39:19,416
Whoo!

1502
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:25,075
- Oh.!
- We gotta go back.

1503
01:39:25,176 --> 01:39:27,925
What?

1504
01:39:28,023 --> 01:39:31,087
We gotta go back. I left my wallet.

1505
01:39:31,190 --> 01:39:33,076
Credit cards, cash, my fucking I.D.

1506
01:39:33,176 --> 01:39:35,541
- Everything. We gotta go back.
- Big deal. It's fine.

1507
01:39:35,638 --> 01:39:38,702
Don't worry about it. We'll call now
and we'll cancel your cards.

1508
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:41,521
No, Miles,you don't understand.
The wedding rings.

1509
01:39:41,622 --> 01:39:43,443
The wedding rings are in my wallet.

1510
01:39:43,542 --> 01:39:48,273
Fine, they're in your wallet, and you
left your wallet in some bar, okay?

1511
01:39:48,372 --> 01:39:50,858
- Christine will understand.
- She had to order them special.

1512
01:39:50,965 --> 01:39:52,787
It took her forever to find 'em.

1513
01:39:52,885 --> 01:39:56,876
They've got this design of dolphins
and our names engraved in Sanskrit.

1514
01:39:56,981 --> 01:40:00,394
We gotta go back, man.
Christine will fucking crucify me, Miles.

1515
01:40:00,499 --> 01:40:02,439
No way, no way, no way.

1516
01:40:02,546 --> 01:40:04,453
Please. Please!

1517
01:40:04,563 --> 01:40:07,692
Forget it.
Your wallet was stolen in some bar.

1518
01:40:07,796 --> 01:40:10,641
- It happens every day.
- No, we gotta go back and get my wallet, Miles.

1519
01:40:10,738 --> 01:40:14,249
I'm telling you,
those rings are irreplaceable.

1520
01:40:14,355 --> 01:40:17,353
Look, I know I fucked up, okay?
I know I fucked up.

1521
01:40:17,456 --> 01:40:19,342
- But you've gotta help me.
- Yeah.

1522
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:22,886
You've gotta help me, Miles,
please.! Please.!

1523
01:40:22,993 --> 01:40:25,196
I can't lose Christine, Miles.

1524
01:40:25,296 --> 01:40:27,847
I just-- I can't.
I can't lose Christine.

1525
01:40:27,952 --> 01:40:30,055
- Mm-hmm.
- I know I fucked up.

1526
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:33,899
I know I did a bad thing, all right?
And I know I'm a bad person.

1527
01:40:33,999 --> 01:40:38,251
I know I am. But you gotta help me!
You have to help me, Miles.

1528
01:40:38,350 --> 01:40:41,664
Okay? Tell me you'll help me.

1529
01:40:41,773 --> 01:40:44,422
If I lose Christine, I-I-I--

1530
01:40:44,524 --> 01:40:46,529
I'm nothing.

1531
01:40:46,637 --> 01:40:49,930
I just have-- I'm nothing.

1532
01:40:50,029 --> 01:40:51,969
God.

1533
01:40:52,076 --> 01:40:54,408
- Did she tell you she was married?
- Yeah.

1534
01:40:54,507 --> 01:40:56,392
So what the fuck were you thinking?

1535
01:40:56,493 --> 01:40:59,906
Wasn't supposed to be back till 6:00.
Fucker rolls in at 5:00.

1536
01:41:00,011 --> 01:41:02,911
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?

1537
01:41:03,017 --> 01:41:05,220
- This is the block.
- You sure?

1538
01:41:05,323 --> 01:41:07,208
Yeah.

1539
01:41:10,473 --> 01:41:12,294
That's it. That's it.

1540
01:41:12,392 --> 01:41:14,277
That's the one right there.

1541
01:41:14,378 --> 01:41:16,383
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1542
01:41:16,489 --> 01:41:18,374
Okay.

1543
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:25,594
All right.
Okay, so what's the plan?

1544
01:41:25,702 --> 01:41:28,089
Uh, the plan is...

1545
01:41:28,198 --> 01:41:30,019
you go.

1546
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:33,052
- Me?
- 'Cause of my ankle.

1547
01:41:33,158 --> 01:41:36,003
Still hurts.Just go explain
the situation, Miles.

1548
01:41:36,102 --> 01:41:38,588
Explain the situation. Yes.

1549
01:41:38,693 --> 01:41:42,783
"Excuse me, sir. My friend was the one
balling your wife a couple of hours ago.

1550
01:41:42,884 --> 01:41:45,881
"Really sorry. He seems to
have left his wallet behind.

1551
01:41:45,988 --> 01:41:48,833
I was wondering if I could come in
and just poke around. I don't know."

1552
01:41:48,932 --> 01:41:51,930
- Yeah,just like that. That's good.
- Oh, for Christ's sake.

1553
01:41:54,819 --> 01:41:58,362
Oh, fuck it! I'll go.
I guess I have to do everything.

1554
01:41:58,467 --> 01:42:01,814
No. Hold on.

1555
01:43:43,538 --> 01:43:46,384
You think I don't fuck you, bitch?
I'm fucking you now.

1556
01:43:46,484 --> 01:43:49,482
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.!

1557
01:43:49,586 --> 01:43:51,973
You picked him up and you fucked him,
didn't you, bitch?

1558
01:43:52,083 --> 01:43:55,626
Yeah, I picked him up and I fucked him.
I'm a bad girl.!

1559
01:43:55,730 --> 01:43:58,281
You liked fucking him,
didn't you, you little whore?

1560
01:43:58,384 --> 01:44:02,376
I liked it when you caught me fucking him!
Oh, yes! Oh, yeah!

1561
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:04,302
You are a bad bitch.

1562
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:06,765
- Yeah, you caught me.
- You're such a whore.

1563
01:44:06,864 --> 01:44:09,100
Oh,yeah.!

1564
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:11,881
- Oh, baby.
- Oh, it's so good.!

1565
01:44:13,968 --> 01:44:15,789
I fucked him.

1566
01:44:15,887 --> 01:44:18,984
- You're so bad.
- I am. Yeah.

1567
01:44:21,006 --> 01:44:24,582
You are such a whore.

1568
01:44:24,687 --> 01:44:29,027
- What the fuck.!
- The wallet.! He's got Derek's wallet.!

1569
01:44:29,133 --> 01:44:31,913
I think they
were surprised by the level of protest...

1570
01:44:32,012 --> 01:44:34,628
that was really happening
within the company.

1571
01:44:34,732 --> 01:44:39,464
The injustice may be their plan,
and they said, "Well, we can'tjust go--"

1572
01:44:39,564 --> 01:44:43,303
- Oh! Here's your wallet! Oh, shit!
- Motherfucker!

1573
01:44:43,403 --> 01:44:45,768
Open the goddamn door!

1574
01:44:45,867 --> 01:44:47,753
- I'm gonna kill your ass.!
- You got it.! You got my wallet.!

1575
01:44:47,850 --> 01:44:52,452
I'll find you! I will find you, bub!
I'll find your ass!

1576
01:44:52,553 --> 01:44:55,551
You're mine, man! You're mine!

1577
01:44:55,658 --> 01:44:58,177
Fuck you.! I'm gonna get your ass.!

1578
01:45:27,941 --> 01:45:32,380
- You wanna let me drive?
- No, it's all right. I got it.

1579
01:45:32,483 --> 01:45:35,798
Hey, you know, you oughta
invite Maya to the wedding.

1580
01:45:35,908 --> 01:45:37,729
Hmm.

1581
01:45:37,827 --> 01:45:40,476
Somehow I think
inviting Maya to the wedding...

1582
01:45:40,578 --> 01:45:43,510
is not the right move
at this juncture.

1583
01:45:43,618 --> 01:45:45,439
I don't know.

1584
01:45:45,539 --> 01:45:47,424
In fact,
after all of your shenanigans...

1585
01:45:47,522 --> 01:45:50,422
it's gonna be hard for me
to ever go to The Hitching Post again.

1586
01:45:50,529 --> 01:45:53,374
You know, there was a nice way
to respond to that.

1587
01:45:53,474 --> 01:45:56,788
- Come on. Let me drive.
- No, I got it. You should rest.

1588
01:45:56,896 --> 01:45:59,644
You know what? I feel like driving.

1589
01:45:59,743 --> 01:46:01,564
Okay.

1590
01:46:01,665 --> 01:46:04,697
Uh... hey, put on your seat belt, okay?

1591
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:07,036
I was just about to.
What's the problem?

1592
01:46:07,135 --> 01:46:11,410
-Just want to remind you to be safe.
- We missed the entrance.

1593
01:46:11,519 --> 01:46:14,038
What are you doing,Jack?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1594
01:46:14,142 --> 01:46:16,507
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell are you doing?
- Hang on.

1595
01:46:16,605 --> 01:46:18,808
Jack!

1596
01:46:18,912 --> 01:46:20,733
What the fuck!

1597
01:46:20,830 --> 01:46:23,545
- You said it looked like an accident.
- What the fuck!

1598
01:46:23,644 --> 01:46:25,466
I'll pay for it.

1599
01:46:25,564 --> 01:46:30,318
Jesus. Christ,Jack!
Oh, for Ch-- Look at this!

1600
01:46:30,429 --> 01:46:33,722
- Huh.
- Oh.

1601
01:46:33,818 --> 01:46:35,639
I don't know.

1602
01:46:35,739 --> 01:46:39,315
Doesn't look like anyone
was injured in this one.

1603
01:46:39,419 --> 01:46:41,240
No. No.

1604
01:46:41,339 --> 01:46:43,857
- Watch your head.
- Yeah.

1605
01:46:43,963 --> 01:46:47,027
Boy, you broke a couple of'em,
you know.

1606
01:46:47,129 --> 01:46:49,975
- Whatever. Sorry.
- No, no, no. It's not "whatever."

1607
01:46:50,073 --> 01:46:52,558
You fuckin' derelict.

1608
01:46:52,666 --> 01:46:54,487
You ready?

1609
01:46:54,584 --> 01:46:57,616
Just get it over with.

1610
01:47:36,755 --> 01:47:40,746
Okeydoke. All right.

1611
01:47:40,849 --> 01:47:43,564
Well, I guess that's about it.

1612
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:48,203
- Want to come inside?
- Uh, no. No, you're on your own.

1613
01:47:49,489 --> 01:47:52,007
All right. I guess
I'll see you at the rehearsal.

1614
01:47:52,113 --> 01:47:53,998
Yup.

1615
01:47:55,248 --> 01:47:57,351
I love you, man.

1616
01:47:57,456 --> 01:47:59,724
Yeah. Back at ya.

1617
01:47:59,822 --> 01:48:04,096
- Miles, don't drive away until they see the car.
- I know, I know, I know.

1618
01:48:04,206 --> 01:48:06,922
Hey, wait a second. Wait a second.
How come I wasn't hurt?

1619
01:48:07,021 --> 01:48:10,336
'Cause you were wearing your seat belt.

1620
01:48:12,749 --> 01:48:14,634
Nicely done.

1621
01:48:34,476 --> 01:48:36,361
- Hi.
-Jack.

1622
01:48:36,458 --> 01:48:38,279
- Yeah.
- Uh, Christine, Mike!

1623
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:26,786
Amen.

1624
01:50:45,974 --> 01:50:48,755
Hey, Miles.

1625
01:50:48,854 --> 01:50:53,129
Hi, Vicki.
Wow, you look beautiful.

1626
01:50:53,239 --> 01:50:55,060
Thanks.

1627
01:50:55,157 --> 01:50:57,741
Um, this is Ken Cortland,
my husband.

1628
01:50:57,845 --> 01:50:59,667
- How are you?
- How are you?

1629
01:50:59,765 --> 01:51:01,673
- Good, thanks.
- Yeah, yeah. Nice to meet you.

1630
01:51:01,780 --> 01:51:05,039
- You're a lucky guy.
- Yes, I am. Thank you.

1631
01:51:05,140 --> 01:51:07,113
Yeah.

1632
01:51:07,221 --> 01:51:10,001
Well, I'll just wait for you at the car.

1633
01:51:10,101 --> 01:51:12,946
- It was great meeting you, Miles.
- Ken.

1634
01:51:16,530 --> 01:51:19,976
- Well, that was big of him.
- Yeah, he's good that way.

1635
01:51:20,083 --> 01:51:23,855
- He's very considerate.
- That's great.

1636
01:51:23,954 --> 01:51:26,255
So how are you doing?

1637
01:51:26,354 --> 01:51:29,003
Since the last time we spoke?
I don't know.

1638
01:51:29,105 --> 01:51:32,267
Could be better. Could be worse.

1639
01:51:32,370 --> 01:51:36,710
- So what's happening with your book?
- Um, universally rejected.

1640
01:51:36,816 --> 01:51:40,775
- Strike three.
- Oh, Miles, that's awful.

1641
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:43,464
What are you gonna do?

1642
01:51:43,568 --> 01:51:46,664
Back to the drawing board,
I guess. Or not.

1643
01:51:46,767 --> 01:51:49,285
I don't know.

1644
01:51:49,391 --> 01:51:52,236
So, anyway, you're married.

1645
01:51:52,334 --> 01:51:55,431
Congratulations. You look happy.

1646
01:51:55,533 --> 01:51:57,833
- I am.
- Good.

1647
01:51:57,935 --> 01:52:00,551
Seems like everybody's getting married.

1648
01:52:00,654 --> 01:52:04,393
Last year was all divorces.
This year it's all weddings.

1649
01:52:04,493 --> 01:52:07,338
- Cyclical, I guess.
- I guess.

1650
01:52:12,554 --> 01:52:15,552
Well, uh, what do you say
we hit the reception?

1651
01:52:15,659 --> 01:52:18,559
Have some champagne,
toast the newlyweds, huh?

1652
01:52:18,667 --> 01:52:20,488
Not me. I'm not drinking.

1653
01:52:20,586 --> 01:52:24,512
You quit drinking. Really?

1654
01:52:24,618 --> 01:52:26,504
I'm pregnant.

1655
01:52:28,360 --> 01:52:30,245
I see.

1656
01:52:31,561 --> 01:52:33,926
Yes, I see. Great.

1657
01:52:35,944 --> 01:52:38,789
Well, congratulations again, Vicki.

1658
01:52:38,887 --> 01:52:41,667
Boy, that's wonderful news.

1659
01:52:43,335 --> 01:52:45,853
- See you over there, Miles?
- Yeah.

1660
01:54:45,045 --> 01:54:46,866
Hmm.

1661
01:54:52,309 --> 01:54:55,722
"'The marrow ofhis bone, '
I repeated aimlessly.

1662
01:54:55,827 --> 01:54:58,192
"This, at last, penetrated my mind.

1663
01:54:58,292 --> 01:55:01,192
"Phineas had died
from the marrow of his bone...

1664
01:55:01,298 --> 01:55:04,460
"flowing down his bloodstream
to his heart.

1665
01:55:04,562 --> 01:55:07,692
"I did not cry then or ever about Finny.

1666
01:55:07,794 --> 01:55:10,858
"I did not cry even when I stood...

1667
01:55:10,961 --> 01:55:14,603
"watching him being lowered into
his family's straitlaced burial ground...

1668
01:55:14,705 --> 01:55:16,526
"outside of Boston.

1669
01:55:16,625 --> 01:55:19,940
"I could not escape the feeling
that this was my own funeral...

1670
01:55:20,048 --> 01:55:23,494
and you do not cry in that case. "

1671
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:26,598
Should I keep reading
the next chapter, Mr. Raymond?

1672
01:55:26,703 --> 01:55:30,345
Uh, no, no.
We'll pick up there Monday.

1673
01:56:15,465 --> 01:56:18,214
One new message.

1674
01:56:18,312 --> 01:56:22,271
Hello, Miles. It's Maya.

1675
01:56:22,375 --> 01:56:24,740
Thanks for your letter.

1676
01:56:24,839 --> 01:56:26,746
I-I would have called sooner...

1677
01:56:26,855 --> 01:56:29,700
but I think I needed some time to think
about everything that happened...

1678
01:56:29,799 --> 01:56:33,113
and what you wrote to me.

1679
01:56:33,223 --> 01:56:35,806
Another reason, um,
I didn't call you sooner...

1680
01:56:35,909 --> 01:56:39,223
is because I wanted to finish your book,
which I finally did last night.

1681
01:56:39,334 --> 01:56:42,234
And I think it's really lovely, Miles.

1682
01:56:42,340 --> 01:56:44,705
You're so good with words.

1683
01:56:44,804 --> 01:56:47,169
Who cares
if it's not getting published?

1684
01:56:47,268 --> 01:56:51,325
There are so many beautiful
and... painful things about it.

1685
01:56:52,579 --> 01:56:55,228
Did you really go through all that?

1686
01:56:55,331 --> 01:56:57,850
Must have been awful.

1687
01:56:57,954 --> 01:57:02,686
And the sister character--
geez, what a wreck.

1688
01:57:02,787 --> 01:57:07,061
But I have to say that, well,
I was really confused by the ending.

1689
01:57:07,170 --> 01:57:10,484
I mean, did the father
finally commit suicide, or what?

1690
01:57:10,593 --> 01:57:12,478
It's driving me crazy.

1691
01:57:14,944 --> 01:57:16,982
Anyway...

1692
01:57:17,087 --> 01:57:20,827
it's turned cold and rainy here lately...

1693
01:57:20,927 --> 01:57:23,446
but I like winter.

1694
01:57:23,551 --> 01:57:28,154
So, listen, if you ever do decide to come
up here again,you should let me know.

1695
01:57:28,255 --> 01:57:30,937
I would say stop by the restaurant,
but to tell you the truth...

1696
01:57:31,038 --> 01:57:33,403
I'm not sure how much longer
I'm gonna be working there...

1697
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:35,506
because I'm going to graduate soon.

1698
01:57:35,613 --> 01:57:38,033
So I'll probably want to relocate.

1699
01:57:38,141 --> 01:57:40,027
I mean, we'll see.

1700
01:57:41,436 --> 01:57:45,230
Anyway, like I said,
I really loved your novel.

1701
01:57:45,341 --> 01:57:50,040
Don't give up, Miles.
Keep writing.

1702
01:57:50,139 --> 01:57:52,024
I hope you're well.

1703
01:57:53,277 --> 01:57:55,162
Bye.
