169
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,143
You understand. Of course you do.

170
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,061
So, to make it short.

Out of the whole town,

172
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,650

My Tzeitel?

174
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,113
No, the Tsar's Tzeitel.

175
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,157
Of course your Tzeitel.

176
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,994
Such a match for my Tzeitel.

177
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:23,041
But... But Tevye wants a learned man.

178
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,625
He doesn't like Lazar.

179
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,753
Good, so Lazar won't marry him.

180
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,756
He wants the daughter, not the father.

181
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,175
Listen. Listen to me, Golde.

182
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,968
You send Tevye to him.

183

Don't tell him what it's about.

184

Let Lazar discuss it himself.

185
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,182
He'll win him over.

186
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,976
He's a good man and a wealthy man.

187
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,729
So, you'll let me know how it went.

188
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,607
And you don't have to thank me, Golde,

189
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,567
because aside from my fee,

190
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,819
which Lazar will pay anyway,

191
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,821
it gives me satisfaction

your eye on your books.

00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:13,597
PERCHIK: No.

335
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,723
Where are you from?

336
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,350
Kiev.

337
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,268
I was a student in the university there.

338
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,645
(ALL CHUCKLING)

339
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:20,771
The university.

340
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,649
Tell me,
is that a place where you learned

341
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,692
how not to respect your elders?

342
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,862
That is where I learned
there is more to life than talk.

343
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,074
You should know
what's going on in the outside world.

344
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,200
Careful, my paper.

345
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,078
Why should I break my head
about the outside world?

346
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,372
Let the outside world
break its own head.

347
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:39,873
Well put.

348
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,544
He's right. As the Good Book says,

349
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:47,923
"If you spit in the air,
it lands in your face."

350
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,092
Nonsense.

351
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,679
You can't close your eyes
to what's happening in the world.

352
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,182
He's right.

353
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,226
He's right and he's right?

354
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,311
They can't both be right.

355
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,898
You know, you are also right.

356
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,316
He is right.

357
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,236
He's too young to wipe his own nose.
Good Sabbath, Tevye.

358
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,821
University!

359
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,739
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

360
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,700
- Here. Good Sabbath.
- Good Sabbath, Tevye.

361
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:15,909
Good Sabbath.

362
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,578
Tevye, Tevye.

363
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,581
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. I apologize.

364
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,749
Here.

365
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:23,917
- Good Sabbath.
- Good Sabbath.

366
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,878
- Good Sabbath.
- Tevye, the rabbi's order.

367
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,463
Of course.

368
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,508
So you are from Kiev, Reb...

369
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,218
- Perchik.
- Perchik.

370
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,888
So you are a newcomer here?

371
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,933
As Abraham said,

372
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:44,146
"I'm a stranger in a strange land."

373
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,106
Moses said that.

374
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,568
Forgive me. Forgive me.
As King David said,

375
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,779
"I'm slow of speech and slow of tongue."

376
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,115
That was also Moses.

377
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,828
For a man with a slow tongue,
he talked a lot.

378
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,708
Here, Reb Perchik.

379
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,168
Have a piece.

380
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,755
I have no money, and I'm not a beggar.

381
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,924
Take it. It's a blessing for me to give.

382
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,179
Very well.

383
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,305
For your sake.

384
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,807
Thank you. Thank you.

385
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:24,352
You know, it's no crime to be poor.

386
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,730
In this world it is the rich
who are the criminals.

387
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,440
Someday their wealth will be ours.

388
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,400
That would be nice.

389
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,819
If they would agree, I would agree.

390
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,865
And who will make this miracle
to come to pass?

391
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,784
People. Ordinary people.

392
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,327
Like you?

393
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:41,870
Like me.

394
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:45,165
TEVYE: And until your golden day
comes, Reb Perchik,

395
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,666
how will you live?

396
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,168
By giving lessons to children.

397
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,753
Do you have any children?

398
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,797
I have five daughters.

399
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:53,924
Five?

400
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,510
Daughters!

401
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,345
PERCHIK: Girls should learn, too.

402
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,596
Girls are people.

403
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,348
- A radical!
- Go away.

404
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,724
I'd be willing to teach them.

405
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,684
Open their minds to great thoughts.

406
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:05,852
Yeah?

407
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,063
I'd like them to know the Good Book.

408
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,774
Well, the Bible has many lessons
for our times.

409
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,984
Perchik,

410
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,863
I'm a very poor man,

411
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:20,242
but food for lessons, huh?

412
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:23,370
Good. Good.
Stay with us for the Sabbath.

413
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,705
Of course, we don't eat like kings,

414
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,541
but we don't starve, either.

415
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:31,169
As the Good Book says,
"When a poor man eats a chicken,

416
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,380
"one of them is sick."

417
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,881
Where does the book say that?

418
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,758
All right. All right.

419
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,760
It doesn't exactly say that,

420
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:41,888
but someplace it has something
about a chicken.

421
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,515
- Good Sabbath.
- Good Sabbath.

422
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,391
Good Sabbath.

423
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,893
TZEITEL: Do you really
think Yente found someone?

424
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,061
HODEL: I don't know.

425
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,271
TEVYE: Good Sabbath, children.

426
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,730
ALL: Good Sabbath, Papa.

427
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,233
Children, this is Perchik.

428
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,694
Perchik, this is my eldest daughter.

429
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:56,820
- Good Sabbath.
- Good Sabbath.

430
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,071
You have a pleasant daughter.

431
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,240
I have five pleasant daughters.

432
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,742
- This is mine.
- Good Sabbath.

433
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,744
- And this is mine.
- Good Sabbath, Papa.

434
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:10,584
And this is mine.

435
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,043
And this...

436
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,629
Well, this is not mine.

437
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:17,090
Perchik, this is Motel Kamzoil.

438
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,759
So, you did us a favor and came home.

439
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,930
Well, this is also mine.

440
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:28,602
Golde, Golde, this is Perchik from Kiev.

441
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:32,189
He'll be staying the Sabbath with us.
He is a teacher.

442
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,982
Would you like
to take lessons from him?

443
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,108
- Yes, Papa.
- Good.

444
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,318
I'm a very good teacher.

445
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:39,446
I heard once that the rabbi
who must praise himself

446
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,281
has a congregation of one.

447
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,741
(LAUGHING)

448
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,910
Your daughter has
a quick and witty tongue.

449
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,621
Yeah, the wit she gets from me.

450
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,456
As the Good Book says...

451
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,458
The Good Book can wait. Get washed.

452
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,293
This tongue she gets from her mother.

453
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,754
Motel, you're also eating with us?

454
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:59,299
- If...
- Of course. Another blessing.

455
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,926
Tzeitel, Tzeitel, get the small table.

456
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,094
And, Chava, the two chairs from outside.

457
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,138
Children, finish dressing.
You can wash at the well.

458
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,765
- Oh, thank you.
- Hurry, Hodel, help him. Hurry.

459
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,100
Hurry. It's almost the Sabbath. Hurry!

460
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,646
Tevye.

461
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,815
Tevye, I have something to say to you.

462
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,151
Why should today be different?

463
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,987
Tevye, I have something to tell you.

464
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,657
- Tzeitel, I have something to tell you.
- Motel,

465
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,742
- Yente was here.
- I know. I saw her.

466
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,827
If they agree on someone,
there will be a match,

467
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,454
and then it will be too late for us.

468
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:33,750
But, Tzeitel, I have found someone who
will sell me his used sewing machine.

469
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,586
So maybe in a few weeks
I'll have saved up enough to buy it.

470
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,172
- And then your father...
- A few weeks might be too late.

471
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,966
Lazar Wolf wants to see you.

472
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,717
The butcher? What is it about?

473
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,345
I don't know,
only he says it's important.

474
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:48,682
What can be important?
I have nothing for him to slaughter.

475
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,351
After the Sabbath,
see him, talk with him.

476
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,186
Talk about what?

477
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:56,481
If he is thinking about buying
my new milk cow,

478
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,024
he can forget it.

479
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,859
Tevye, I want you to talk...

480

What else can I do?

484
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,379
You could ask my father
for my hand tonight.

485
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,922
Now.

486
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,800
Why should he consider me now?
I'm only a poor tailor.

487
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,553
And I'm only the daughter
of a poor milkman.

488
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:27,721
Just talk to him.

489
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,807
Tzeitel, if your father says no,
that's it. It's final.

490
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,894
- He'll yell at me.
- Motel.

491
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,063
I'm just a poor tailor.

492
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:41,568
Motel, even a poor tailor
is entitled to some happiness.

493
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:45,905
That's true.

00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,389
I hear that congratulations
are in order, Tevye.

667
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:17,683
Thank you, Your Honor.

668
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,143
Thank you.

669
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:24,523
Tevye.

670

(TEVYE LAUGHING)

671
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,321
Yes, Your Honor.

672
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:36,034
I have this piece of news
I think I should tell you as a friend.

673
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:37,661
Yes, Your Honor.

674
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:40,164
I'm giving you this news
because I like you.

675
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,625
You're an honest, decent person,

676
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:45,169
even though you are a Jew.

677
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,048
Thank you, Your Honor.

678
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:54,386
How often does a man get
a compliment like that?

679
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,847
And the news?

680
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:00,601
We have received orders
that sometime soon

681
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:04,021
this district is to have
a little unofficial demonstration.

682
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:07,900
What?

683
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:12,863
A pogrom?

684
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,115
- Here?
- No, no, no, no.

685
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:17,409
Just a little unofficial demonstration.

686
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,286
Little?

687
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,747
How little?

688
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:22,915
Not too serious.

689
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:25,626
Just some mischief,
so that if an inspector comes through,

690
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:27,544
he can see that we did our duty.

691
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,631
Personally, I don't know why

692
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:32,633
there has to be this trouble
between people,

693
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:35,219
but I thought I should tell you.

694
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,264
Thank you, Your Honor.

695
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,893
You are a good man.

696
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:47,314
If I may say so,

697
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,691
it's too bad you are not a Jew.

698
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:53,237
That's what I like about you, Tevye.

699
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:55,155
You're always joking.

700
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,372
Congratulations again for your daughter.

701
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,290
Thank you, Your Honor.

702
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:07,834
About the other matter,

703
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:09,044
it won't be too bad.

704
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,587
I wouldn't worry.

705
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,256
TEVYE: Yeah, of course not.

706
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:31,775
Dear God,

707
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:36,822
did you have to send me news like that

708
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:39,449
today of all days?

709
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:45,497
I know, I know.
We are the chosen people.

710
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,667
But once in a while,

711
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,336
can't you choose someone else?

712
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,511
Anyway,

713
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:03,974
thank you for sending a husband

714
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:05,809
for my Tzeitel.

(FIDDLE PLAYING)

717
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:13,877
PERCHIK: Now,

718
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:17,506
after Jacob had worked
for Laban for seven years,

719
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:19,675
do you know what happened?

720
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:21,259
Laban fooled him

721
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:24,471
and gave him his ugly daughter Leah.

722
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:25,889
So to marry Rachel,

723
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:29,434
Jacob was forced to work
another seven years.

724
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:30,560
So you see, children,

725
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:32,979
the Bible clearly teaches us

726
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:35,524
you can never trust an employer.

727
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:38,360
GIRL: And that is what
the Bible teaches us?

728
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:40,779
That is the lesson
of the story of Jacob,

729
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:43,281
if you interpret it correctly.

730
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,325
Is your papa up yet?

731
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:46,493
No, Mama.

732
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:48,787
Enough lessons!

733
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,039
Back to the house.
There's work to be done.

734
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:54,000
Go on, children.
Another story tomorrow.

(GIRLS GIGGLING)

736
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,759
That was a very
interesting lesson, Perchik.

737
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:05,595
Do you think so?

738
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,182
Although I don't know
if the rabbi would agree

739
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:10,851
with your interpretation.

740
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:15,397
Neither, I suppose,
would the rabbi's son.

741
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:18,775
My little sisters talk too much.

742
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:22,904
And what do you know about him
except that he is the rabbi's son?

743
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,698
At least I know this,

744
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:28,702
he doesn't have any strange ideas
about turning the world upside down.

745

Good day, Perchik.

746
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:32,998
You have wit,
even a little intelligence.

747
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,583
- Thank you.
- Perhaps.

748
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,001
But what good is your brain?

749
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:38,795
Without curiosity, it is a rusty tool.

750
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:40,714
Good day, Hodel.

751
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,799
We have an old custom here.

752
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:45,552
A boy talks respectfully to a girl.

753
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:47,846
But, of course, that is too traditional

754
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:49,681
for an advanced thinker like you.

755
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,600
"Our traditions."
"Nothing must change."

756
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,810
"Everything is perfect
exactly the way it is."

757
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:55,228
We like our ways.

758
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:57,981
Our ways are changing all over but here.

boys and girls can be affectionate

760

without the permission
of a matchmaker?

761
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,989
They hold hands together.

762
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:07,741
They even dance together.

763
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:09,951
New dances. Like this.

764
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:17,793

besides your drinking like a peasant?

780

Well?

Well, what did he say?

What did you say?

01:04:58,895 --> 01:04:59,978
Where...

785

- Where... Where is Tzeitel?
- She's in the barn.

- Do you have news for me?

- Oh, the other way.

Well, what happened?

All of them.

1050
01:23:01,559 --> 01:23:06,105
Even your great uncle Mordechai
was there,

and your cousin Rachel was there.

1052
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:13,278
And in the middle of the dream,

1053
01:23:13,446 --> 01:23:15,906
in walks your grandmother Tzeitel,

1054

I am giving the newlyweds

1169
01:42:18,799 --> 01:42:20,842
five chickens,

1170
01:42:21,176 --> 01:42:24,679
one for each of the first five Sabbaths

1171
01:42:24,847 --> 01:42:27,765
of their wedded life.

1172
01:42:35,816 --> 01:42:37,567
Reb Lazar Wolf,

1173
01:42:37,734 --> 01:42:40,236
you are a decent man,

1174
01:42:40,404 --> 01:42:42,738
and on behalf of my daughter

1175
01:42:42,906 --> 01:42:44,740
and her new husband...

1176
01:42:44,908 --> 01:42:45,908
Sit down.

1177
01:42:46,076 --> 01:42:47,535
I accept your gift.

1178
01:42:48,954 --> 01:42:50,997
There is a famous saying that...

1179
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:54,500
Reb Tevye,
I am not marrying your daughter.

1180
01:42:54,668 --> 01:42:56,919
I don't have to listen to your sayings.

1181
01:42:57,087 --> 01:42:58,796
Why, if you would only listen
for one moment.

1182
01:42:58,964 --> 01:43:00,631
Why should I listen to you?

1183
01:43:00,799 --> 01:43:02,758
A man who breaks an agreement!

1184
01:43:03,886 --> 01:43:05,511
I have a right to talk!

1185
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:06,929
What right? It's not your wedding.

1186
01:43:07,097 --> 01:43:08,431
It should have been!

1187
01:43:08,599 --> 01:43:10,349
But it's not, thank goodness.

1188
01:43:10,517 --> 01:43:12,185
Don't shame Reb Tevye
at his daughter's wedding.

1189
01:43:12,352 --> 01:43:15,313
He shamed me
in front of the whole village.

1190
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:17,648
- He shamed me!
- Praise God, he did.

Yeah.

I say, let's sit down.

1196
01:43:32,122 --> 01:43:35,708
Yes, yes. Well,
we all heard the words of the rabbi.

1197
01:43:36,251 --> 01:43:37,585
Let's sit down.

You leave my chickens out of this!

1203
01:44:01,485 --> 01:44:02,818
We made a bargain!

1204
01:44:02,986 --> 01:44:04,654
But the terms weren't settled.

1205
01:44:04,821 --> 01:44:06,405
We drank on it!

1206
01:44:07,658 --> 01:44:08,824
You just sit down, all right?

1207
01:44:08,992 --> 01:44:11,744
Once a butcher, always a butcher.

1208

and not Lazar.

- That's a sin!
- It's no sin to dance at a wedding.

- Yes, with a girl.

- Come over here.
- It's a sin.

It's no sin. Ask the rabbi.

01:56:29,357 --> 01:56:30,983
Please don't be upset.

1331
01:56:31,150 --> 01:56:32,567
Why should I be upset?

1332
01:56:32,735 --> 01:56:33,694
If you must leave, you must.

1333
01:56:33,861 --> 01:56:34,945
I do have to.

1334
01:56:35,321 --> 01:56:36,279
Couldn't you have told me?

1335
01:56:36,447 --> 01:56:39,241
Great changes are about to take place
in this country.

1336
01:56:39,409 --> 01:56:40,617
Tremendous changes.

1337
01:56:41,411 --> 01:56:43,745
But they can't happen by themselves.

1338
01:56:43,913 --> 01:56:46,039
So, naturally,
you feel that you personally have to...

1339
01:56:46,207 --> 01:56:49,126
Not only me, many people, Jews,
Gentiles.

1340
01:56:49,293 --> 01:56:51,003
Many people hate what's going on.

1341
01:56:51,170 --> 01:56:52,254
Don't you understand?

1342
01:56:52,547 --> 01:56:54,131
I understand. Of course.

1343
01:56:55,341 --> 01:56:56,675
You want to leave.

1344
01:56:58,094 --> 01:57:00,387
Then, goodbye.

1345
01:57:01,597 --> 01:57:03,140
Hodel, listen to me.

1346
01:57:03,766 --> 01:57:05,892
I have work to do.

1347
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:08,603
The greatest work a man can do.

1348
01:57:11,941 --> 01:57:13,775
Don't you understand?

1349
01:57:15,778 --> 01:57:17,362
Yes, Perchik.

1350
01:57:22,243 --> 01:57:23,452
Hodel.

1351
01:57:23,619 --> 01:57:24,786
Hodel!

1352
01:57:25,496 --> 01:57:27,039
Hodel, wait!

1353
01:57:27,665 --> 01:57:29,416
Hodel, there's a question,

1354
01:57:30,043 --> 01:57:31,960
a certain question
I wish to discuss with you.

1355
01:57:32,128 --> 01:57:33,086
Yes?

1356
01:57:33,254 --> 01:57:34,796
It's a political question.

1357
01:57:34,964 --> 01:57:36,048
What is it?

1358
01:57:36,257 --> 01:57:38,300
The question of marriage.

1359
01:57:42,305 --> 01:57:43,930
Is this a political question?

1360
01:57:44,974 --> 01:57:46,058
Well, yes.

1361
01:57:47,143 --> 01:57:48,602
Yes, everything's political.

1362
01:57:50,021 --> 01:57:52,189
Well, like everything else,
the relationship between

1363
01:57:52,356 --> 01:57:53,690
a man and a woman has

1364
01:57:53,858 --> 01:57:55,567
a socioeconomic base.

1365
01:57:57,403 --> 01:58:00,405
Marriage must be founded on

1366
01:58:00,907 --> 01:58:02,657
mutual beliefs,

1367
01:58:02,825 --> 01:58:05,243
a common attitude
and philosophy towards society.

1368
01:58:05,411 --> 01:58:07,162
And affection.

1369
01:58:08,164 --> 01:58:09,498
Well, yes, of course.

1370
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:12,584
That is also necessary.

1371
01:58:13,461 --> 01:58:15,045
Such a relationship

1372
01:58:15,213 --> 01:58:18,256
can have positive social values.

1373
01:58:18,424 --> 01:58:21,051
When two people face the world with

1374
01:58:21,219 --> 01:58:23,095
unity and solidarity.

1375
01:58:23,262 --> 01:58:24,513
And affection.

1376
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:26,890
Yes, that is an important element.

1377
01:58:30,895 --> 01:58:32,145
At any rate, I...

1378
01:58:33,147 --> 01:58:35,357
I personally am in favor of such a

1379
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:37,901
socioeconomic relationship.

1380
01:58:41,364 --> 01:58:42,405
I think

1381
01:58:44,951 --> 01:58:46,535
you are asking me to marry you.

1382
01:58:49,455 --> 01:58:51,164
Well,

1383
01:58:51,332 --> 01:58:52,874
in a theoretical sense,

1384
01:58:53,709 --> 01:58:56,545
yes, I am.

1385
01:58:57,713 --> 01:58:59,297
I was hoping you were.

1386
01:59:00,424 --> 01:59:01,716
(LAUGHING)

1387
01:59:04,220 --> 01:59:05,720
I'm very happy, Hodel.

1388
01:59:07,390 --> 01:59:09,516
I'm very, very happy.

1389
01:59:24,866 --> 01:59:26,283
(CART RATTLING)

1390
01:59:27,785 --> 01:59:29,202
(LAUGHING)

1391
01:59:41,090 --> 01:59:43,383
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Reb Tevye.

1392
01:59:44,302 --> 01:59:45,719
I have some bad news.

1393
01:59:46,137 --> 01:59:47,179
What?

1394
01:59:47,430 --> 01:59:48,597
I must leave here.

1395
01:59:48,764 --> 01:59:49,764
When?

1396
01:59:50,099 --> 01:59:51,183
Tomorrow morning.

1397
01:59:51,642 --> 01:59:54,477
I'm sorry to hear that, Perchik.

1398
01:59:54,896 --> 01:59:55,979
We'll all miss you.

1399
01:59:56,147 --> 01:59:57,564
But I also have some good news.

1400
01:59:57,732 --> 01:59:58,690
Good.

1401
01:59:58,858 --> 01:59:59,941
You can congratulate me.

1402
02:00:00,109 --> 02:00:01,610
Congratulations. What for?

1403
02:00:01,777 --> 02:00:03,069
We are engaged.

1404
02:00:04,238 --> 02:00:05,197
Engaged?

1405
02:00:05,364 --> 02:00:06,948
Yes, Papa. We're engaged.

1406
02:00:07,241 --> 02:00:08,658
No, you're not.

1407
02:00:08,826 --> 02:00:11,995
I know you like him, and he likes you,

1408
02:00:12,163 --> 02:00:15,624
but you're going away,
and you're staying here.

1409
02:00:16,125 --> 02:00:17,584
So have a nice trip, Perchik.

1410
02:00:17,752 --> 02:00:20,879
And I hope you'll be very happy,
and my answer is no.

1411
02:00:21,047 --> 02:00:22,464
Please, Papa. You don't understand.

1412
02:00:22,632 --> 02:00:24,257
I understand, I understand.

1413
02:00:24,425 --> 02:00:26,426
I gave my permission
to Motel and Tzeitel,

1414
02:00:26,594 --> 02:00:28,803
so you feel you also have a right.

1415
02:00:29,805 --> 02:00:32,057
I'm sorry, Perchik. I like you.

1416
02:00:33,267 --> 02:00:36,228
But you're going away,
so go in good health.

1417
02:00:36,437 --> 02:00:37,854
And my answer is still no.

1418
02:00:38,022 --> 02:00:39,522
You don't understand, Papa.

1419
02:00:39,690 --> 02:00:42,317
And you are not listening. I said no.

1420
02:00:42,693 --> 02:00:43,944
Reb Tevye,

1421
02:00:44,111 --> 02:00:45,987
we are not asking for your permission,

1422
02:00:46,155 --> 02:00:47,656
only for your blessing.

1423
02:00:49,283 --> 02:00:51,117
We are going to get married.

1424
02:00:58,167 --> 02:01:00,669
You are not asking for my permission?

1425
02:01:04,632 --> 02:01:07,092
But we would like your blessing, Papa.

1426
02:01:12,014 --> 02:01:14,849
I can't believe my own ears.

1427
02:01:15,017 --> 02:01:17,602
My blessing? For what?

1428
02:01:17,770 --> 02:01:19,145
(SINGING)

1429
02:01:55,558 --> 02:01:57,517
Where has it led? To this!

1430
02:01:57,977 --> 02:02:00,478
A man tells me he is getting married.

1431
02:02:00,730 --> 02:02:02,939
He doesn't ask me. He tells me!

1432
02:02:03,190 --> 02:02:04,983
But, first, he abandons you.

1433
02:02:05,359 --> 02:02:07,402
He is not abandoning me, Papa.

1434
02:02:07,570 --> 02:02:09,946
As soon as I can,
I will send for her and marry her.

1435
02:02:11,574 --> 02:02:12,824
I love her.

1436
02:02:16,245 --> 02:02:17,912
He loves her.

1437
02:02:19,415 --> 02:02:20,457
Love!

1438
02:02:21,334 --> 02:02:22,584
It's a new style.

1439
02:02:24,128 --> 02:02:25,754
On the other hand,

1440
02:02:25,921 --> 02:02:29,257
our old ways were once new,
weren't they?

1441
02:02:30,426 --> 02:02:31,509
On the other hand,

1442
02:02:31,677 --> 02:02:33,803
they decided without parents,

1443
02:02:33,971 --> 02:02:35,597
without a matchmaker.

1444
02:02:37,558 --> 02:02:39,267
On the other hand,

1445
02:02:39,435 --> 02:02:42,020
did Adam and Eve have a matchmaker?

1446
02:02:44,440 --> 02:02:46,191
Yes.

1447
02:02:46,359 --> 02:02:47,442
They did.

1448
02:02:48,402 --> 02:02:52,447
And it seems these two
have the same matchmaker.

1449
02:02:57,119 --> 02:02:59,496
They're going over my head.

1450
02:02:59,663 --> 02:03:02,457
Unheard of, absurd.

1451
02:03:23,854 --> 02:03:27,607
Tradition!

1452
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:35,281
Well, children, I have decided

1453
02:03:35,449 --> 02:03:38,618
to give you
my blessing and my permission.

1454
02:03:40,830 --> 02:03:42,497
Thank you, Papa.

1455
02:03:44,625 --> 02:03:46,000
What else could I do?

1456
02:03:46,168 --> 02:03:47,961
Thank you, Papa.

1457
02:03:48,129 --> 02:03:51,172
"Thank you, Papa"?

1458
02:03:52,842 --> 02:03:54,968
What am I going to tell your mother?

1459
02:03:55,511 --> 02:03:57,011
Another dream?

1460
02:04:00,683 --> 02:04:02,142
Perhaps if you tell her

1461
02:04:02,309 --> 02:04:04,310
that I'm going to visit a rich uncle.

1462
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:05,770
Perchik.

1463
02:04:06,313 --> 02:04:08,398
Please. I can handle my own wife.

1464
02:04:09,358 --> 02:04:10,650
TEVYE: Golde.

1465
02:04:11,193 --> 02:04:12,360
Golde!

1466
02:04:13,070 --> 02:04:14,028
Golde...

1467
02:04:14,196 --> 02:04:15,321
Hmm?

1468
02:04:17,533 --> 02:04:18,700
Hello, Golde.

1469
02:04:18,868 --> 02:04:20,326
Have some soup.

1470
02:04:24,373 --> 02:04:25,457
Golde,

1471
02:04:27,418 --> 02:04:30,378
I have something very important
to tell you.

1472
02:04:30,546 --> 02:04:31,671
Have the soup.

1473
02:04:32,548 --> 02:04:33,590
It's warm.

1474
02:04:38,554 --> 02:04:39,554
Golde,

1475
02:04:41,390 --> 02:04:43,391
I've just met

1476
02:04:43,559 --> 02:04:45,101
Perchik and Hodel.

1477
02:04:45,269 --> 02:04:46,311
Well?

1478
02:04:46,562 --> 02:04:49,898
Well...

1479
02:04:51,192 --> 02:04:54,736
Well, they seem to be
very fond of each other.

1480
02:04:54,987 --> 02:04:57,363
So? What do you mean?

1481
02:04:57,865 --> 02:04:58,990
So...

1482
02:05:02,161 --> 02:05:04,245
So I've decided

1483
02:05:04,413 --> 02:05:07,582
to give them my permission
to become engaged.

1484
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:09,501
- I'll eat later.
- What?

1485
02:05:09,668 --> 02:05:12,712
Just like that? Without even asking me?

1486
02:05:13,255 --> 02:05:15,131
Who asks you?

1487
02:05:16,467 --> 02:05:17,842
I am the father.

1488
02:05:18,010 --> 02:05:19,385
Who is he?

1489
02:05:19,553 --> 02:05:23,556
A pauper!
He has nothing, absolutely nothing.

1490
02:05:24,266 --> 02:05:25,517
(LAUGHING)

1491
02:05:26,268 --> 02:05:27,977
I wouldn't say that.

1492
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:35,068
I hear he has a rich uncle.

1493
02:05:35,236 --> 02:05:37,862
A rich uncle!

1494
02:05:42,618 --> 02:05:43,660
Golde.

1495
02:05:46,455 --> 02:05:48,331
Golde, he is a good man.

1496
02:05:49,708 --> 02:05:50,792
I like him.

So, what do they look like,

True. The marriage can wait,

but, meanwhile, their future

Is it in anybody's way?

are going to have to leave Anatevka.

Goodbye, Yente.

1994
02:46:49,708 --> 02:46:51,250
Be well,

1995
02:46:52,252 --> 02:46:53,961
- and go in peace.
- Yeah.

1996
02:46:54,295 --> 02:46:55,921
And so goodbye, Golde.

1997
02:46:56,297 --> 02:46:58,257
And sometime maybe we'll meet

1998
02:46:58,425 --> 02:47:00,009
on a happier occasion.

1999
02:47:00,176 --> 02:47:01,593
Meanwhile, we suffer.

2000
02:47:01,761 --> 02:47:03,303
We suffer.

2001
02:47:03,471 --> 02:47:04,680
We suffer in silence.

Right? Of course, right.

Where are you going?

2004

You don't know where you're going?

2005

Come, Golde, we have to leave.

2006
02:47:14,482 --> 02:47:16,775
Leave. It sounds so easy.

2007
02:47:17,193 --> 02:47:20,446
Golde, we'll all be together soon.

2008

they'll come, too.

This Motel is a person.

02:47:26,453 --> 02:47:28,162
And Hodel and Perchik?

2012
02:47:28,580 --> 02:47:29,997
When will we ever see them again?

2013
02:47:30,165 --> 02:47:33,375
Do they come visiting us
from Siberia every Sabbath?

2014
02:47:33,626 --> 02:47:35,586
You know what she writes.

2017
02:47:38,965 --> 02:47:40,591
But soon,

2018
02:47:40,759 --> 02:47:42,051
he will be set free,

2019
02:47:42,218 --> 02:47:45,387
and together they'll
turn the world upside down.

2020
02:47:45,555 --> 02:47:47,306
She couldn't be happier.

2021
02:47:47,974 --> 02:47:49,433

2022

Come, Golde.

2026
02:48:04,407 --> 02:48:06,158
I have to clean up.

2027

I don't want to leave a dirty house.

2036

- That's nice.

But

2044

- a relative is a relative.
- Yes.

2045

- Goodbye, Tevye.
- Goodbye, Lazar Wolf.
