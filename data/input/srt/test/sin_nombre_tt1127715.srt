1
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,620
Miss.

2
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,820
What do you want?

3
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,220
I told you not to come here to bother Benito.

4
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:08,820
Benito!!

5
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,220
You are a criminal and my
baby won't be a criminal like you.

6
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,820
Benito is not coming out!!!

7
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,660
Or I'll call the police to take you to jail,
that's what you want, you asshole.

8
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,620
Grandma.

9
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,900
You shut up and go back inside!

10
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,900
You aren't going out I told you,
don't you understand spanish

11
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,740
Let this be our secret my friend...

12
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,020
...keep the secret here, ok?

13
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,860
Lil' Mago ( Magician ) wants to see you.

14
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,860
One...

15
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,940
Two...

16
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,540
Three...

17
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,260
Four...

18
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,460
Five...

19
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,460
Six...

20
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,180
Seven...

21
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,980
Eight...

22
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,860
Nine...

23
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,660
Ten...

24
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,260
Eleven...

25
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,460
Twelve...

26
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,780
Twelve...

27
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,060
Twelve... Twelve...

28
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,660
...Thirteen.

29
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,980
Congratulations little Homie!

30
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:40,260
Casper, look at the kids smile.

31
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,940
The gang who controls "Salvatrucha" gang.

32
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,260
Your dad is waiting for you.

33
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,220
Look, I know why you
want to do this trip, but...

34
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,700
...I don't know why I have to do it.

35
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,380
If you don't want to go,
grandma can not make you go, but...

36
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,380
...my brother won't come back for you again.

37
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:26,460
Look, I don't need anyone, I can go
to the north by myself if I wanted to.

38
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:35,380
Come with us, it won't be easy over
there, but at least we will be together.

39
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,300
There is nothing for you here, Sayra.

40
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,500
Nothing.

41
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,060
She is here.

42
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,900
Damn, if I didn't know I wouldn't recognize her.

43
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,020
She is a lady now.

44
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,020
Now you can recover your lost time.

45
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,460
We will do that on the way mother.

46
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,100
Tomorrow before sunrise we will grab the bus.

47
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,060
Don't worry, she will be ready.

48
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:46,300
"The Bombilla" Tapachula, Southern Mexico.

49
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,460
Here is Lucrecia with her products.

50
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,580
Casper, how have you been, now you
are a pederast?, the smaller the more idiots.

51
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,020
Look how you beat him up, you are a barbarian.

52
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,220
Tortillas, coffee, baleadas,soups!!!

53
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,580
Thank you!

54
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,500
Slow baby, slow..

55
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,300
Stop it.

56
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,340
Martha Marlene.

57
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,460
I am bored.

58
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,460
why?

59
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,860
Can you take me somewhere?

60
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,460
Where do you want to go?

61
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:49,460
I don't know, wherever you want to,
where you go when you are not here.

62
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,020
You have another girl in your neighborhood, right?

63
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,260
Of course not.

64
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,540
You better not, because if I
realize that you have other girl......

65
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,660
What?

66
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,220
It shrinked...

67
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,180
Oh, it's normal, look...

68
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,700
...now it will be refreshed.

69
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,340
Do you think she will have a friend for me?

70
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,060
Be careful my friend "Smiley"...

71
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,820
...don't say anything that
we left from the "Bombilla"

72
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,780
Don't say anything at all,
so Lil' Mago won't notice.

73
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,500
Ok?

74
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,100
Yes.

75
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,900
Not a fucking word!

76
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,860
Little Homie, you will first earn your letters,
hitting on a "Kiddo" (rival gangster)...

77
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,380
...then after that, you will conquer a girl.

78
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,180
Welcome to the destroyer.

79
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,180
- What's up, homie?
- Cool, brother.

80
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,140
What's up Casper you dog!

81
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,340
What, did he kill a "kiddo" yet, uh?

82
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,900
This is the "Naughty" and the "Smoky"...

83
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,500
...they just arrived, they come and
go to see what's going on here.

84
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,540
They are "Guanacos".
Are you thirsty?

85
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,620
This guy is "gold" we call him "the buttocks"...

86
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,460
...and this is the "Querubin".

87
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,500
He can't sit , his ass is bleeding...

88
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,420
...he has hemorroids.

89
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:38,580
This you have to earn it...
for the moment you have to share.

90
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,140
What's for the gang is for the gang.

91
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:53,540
He is the one that has the second voice.

92
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,740
Hey, my dogs are here.

93
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,420
How was it?

94
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,140
Did you go to the "Bombilla"?

95
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,900
Yes, but we didn't find anything.

96
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,180
The "Sol" found him with
another group of "chickens"...

97
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,300
...in the "Bombilla".

98
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,940
Take him out.

99
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,540
Don't worry, nothing is happening,
now that dog that scares you will die.

100
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:46,340
You fucked up "Kiddo",
you got in the train of the gang.

101
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,340
I'm only going to the north, please, please!!

102
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,300
You are already worthless you fucker...

103
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,420
...we will cut you in 18 pieces
and we will feed the dogs.

104
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,740
I have a family...
and I'm not a gangster anymore.

105
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,740
"kiddo" will always be a "kiddo"

106
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,380
Casper, give "Smiley" a hand.

107
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,700
Both of you, get him.

108
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,860
Point to his head.

109
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,580
This is for the fallen Homies, you fucker.

110
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,300
To the count of three...

111
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,020
One...

112
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,540
Two...

113
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,140
...Three.

114
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:21,820
The first time is like this
little Homie, don't chicken out.

115
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:29,460
The scareness goes away,
but the gang is forever.

116
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:37,660
Now you belong to a family
with thousands of brothers...

117
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:43,820
...wherever you go, there will
always be someone that protects you

118
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,060
Food is here!!

119
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,100
You were not in the "Bombilla" today.

120
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,660
The "Sol" didn't see you.

121
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:22,540
I was there the whole day,
and I didn't see him neither.

122
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,260
You are not playing gay, right Homie?

123
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:35,860
It has been many times already,
now the "Sol" didn't see you.

124
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,620
Forget what I said Homie...

125
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,740
...the homies are getting altered.

126
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,660
I love you dog, from my heart.

127
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,260
3 days later.

128
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:09,020
908 555 0187... again.

129
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,580
we learned it already.

130
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,980
repeat it.

131
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,420
I told you we learned it already.

132
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:23,100
you have to learn that number, if something
goes wrong, Yessenia can help you out.

133
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,020
Horacio, how much time left man?

134
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,620
Around 6 hours.

135
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,700
Are you tired?

136
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,180
Yes.

137
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,580
You have to see it as an adventure brother,
we are going to an adventure.

138
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,860
repeat the number one more time.

139
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:08,780
Guatemala-México Border.

140
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,460
Welcome to México.

141
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,460
Your documents.

142
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,300
You don't have, right?
everyone come this way.

143
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:50,580
First you are going to empty your pockets
and take out everything that has some value...

144
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:56,940
...after that, take off your clothes and put it
in front of you... start with the shoes.

145
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,060
We walked too much!

146
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,700
We need to buy some water for her...

147
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,420
With what money?

148
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,860
Bring two big bottles.

149
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,780
Your second toe is bigger than the others...

150
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,700
...that means you run fast.

151
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,700
This is what we have walked today.

152
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:51,460
If there is no immigration
we will be here in two weeks.

153
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,660
- Two weeks?
- Maybe three.

154
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,260
Where is New Jersey?

155
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,060
It's not in the map.

156
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:11,340
Look, not even half of them will arrive to the U.S.

157
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,700
...but we are going to get there.

158
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,780
Yessenia is not as pretty as your Mom was...

159
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,340
...but she has a big heart.

160
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,620
The girls are beautiful.

161
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,260
Keep it, now they are your family also.

162
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,780
I don't want a picture of your family.

163
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:56,340
You are taking me in this trip,
and I thank you for that.

164
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,580
I will go call home.

165
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,060
Look at him,
I remember him more handsome.

166
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,580
No, the handsome one in the family is me.

167
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,820
Don't tell me you are not a little happy.

168
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,060
If he was not deported, he wouldn't be here.

169
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,180
- Don't think in that bullshit.
- It's not bullshit.

170
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,220
Do you see that train?

171
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:43,620
That's our train, what do you say if
we grab it and go all the way to Texas?

172
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,660
I can take you to six flags.

173
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,260
Tell me one more time that you love me.

174
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,140
I love you.

175
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,540
Tell me that you won't hide me anymore.

176
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,340
It's not that.

177
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,700
Of course, you hide from me.

178
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,060
You already know all that is worth it.

179
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,620
Martha Marlene.

180
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,420
Martha Marlene.

181
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,500
You think I don't realize what you
do the whole day with your friends?

182
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,460
You get high with other girls,
and fool around the whole day.

183
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,300
Homies you two go to the trains.

184
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,260
Casper, Smiley.

185
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,860
What's up "Sol"?

186
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,740
What's up?

187
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,340
Who is this girl?

188
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,900
Martha Marlene, he is  the "Sol".

189
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,620
Is she your girl?

190
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,620
No, she is just a friend.

191
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:24,220
We have meeting tomorrow
at the cemetery, in the afternoon.

192
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,060
Be careful, ok?

193
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:39,980
Hey, be aware Homie,
the entrance is full of "kiddos"...

194
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,980
... who knows who is sneaking in with the people.

195
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,140
I'll take you home.

196
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,540
Friend..... you idiot.

197
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,580
Homie, wait here Smiley.

198
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,900
Wait for me.

199
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,180
Let's go.

200
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,940
There will be no train.

201
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,860
The train went off the rail ahead,
there were many dead people.

202
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,220
Where did you hear that?

203
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,180
Some "Salvadorians" told me.

204
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,660
There will be no train!!!

205
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:41,500
We need more money to buy the
defense for the homies that are in jail.

206
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,540
finally, some Homies have
screwed up in their obligations...

207
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,180
...and the "kiddos" are getting in the territory.

208
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:53,500
We cannot allow those dogs bringing
their garbage in the neighborhood...

209
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,580
There will be "cut" for Casper and Smiley.

210
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,860
They fooled me...

211
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,140
...and you know that you cant lie to the leader....
worst, lie to the neighborhood.

212
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,900
Now I want to hear your version.

213
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,860
Where did you go after the "Bombilla"?

214
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,540
Smiley, where did you go?

215
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,340
Ok, your gun.

216
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,220
that's all.

217
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,940
"Salvatrucha" gang, the gang who
controls the "Salvatrucha" gang.

218
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,420
What are you doing here?

219
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,220
You have to go!

220
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,540
Now!

221
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:07,220
Why? is it a private party?

222
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,540
What's up Casper? who is this girl?

223
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,060
A friend.

224
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,380
From where?

225
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,340
I am from downtown.

226
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,180
Oh, sorry, I confused you.

227
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,620
I was going to take her to the exit.

228
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:23,820
No.

229
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,300
It won't take time Homie.

230
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,460
If you want I can take her...

231
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,140
...or she can stay and watch.

232
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,660
But you don't go anywhere Homie.

233
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,260
Take her directly to her house Homie.

234
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,700
13 seconds of cut for being a liar.

235
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,300
One...

236
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,860
Two...Three...

237
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,980
Smiley, you also have 13 seconds
for not saying anything against Casper.

238
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:33,620
This is the largest tree in Tapachula, if you
go to the top, you can see very far away.

239
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,500
Why Willie couldn't come?

240
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,300
Willie?

241
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,100
Do you refer to Casper?

242
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:53,780
Ohh, I get it now.

243
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,100
You are the reason for him being abscent.

244
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:11,940
Sit down, I want to talk to you.

245
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,180
Closer.

246
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,700
Closer.

247
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,300
Don't be shy, I won't bite you.

248
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,620
So...

249
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,740
...you and Casper are more than friends.

250
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,700
I have to go.

251
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,540
Has he told you anything about us?

252
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:16,300
Do you know what are the most
important rules to keep a friendship?

253
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:26,420
Honesty, respect, and generosity.

254
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,180
hey girl...

255
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,580
Where is Martha Marlene?

256
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,380
She left.

257
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,580
To her house?

258
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,020
The beast took her.

259
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,660
You will find another one.

260
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,500
We are going to make a trip to Tonala...

261
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,260
...you and smiley will go with me.

262
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,540
Homie, one more thing...

263
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,940
...you lie to me again...

264
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,860
... and I will kill you myself.

265
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:57,860
Horacio, they already cleared the railway...

266
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,740
...the train goes this night thank god.

267
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,820
Give me the money!

268
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,820
Fast, fast!

269
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,060
give me the money!

270
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,900
Give him the money fast, fast.

271
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,860
That's enough!

272
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,060
Turn around!

273
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,900
Dad, Dad!!!

274
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,700
Smiley, get off the train!

275
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,700
but.. Casper.

276
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,220
Get off man!!!

277
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,740
Go Smiley, Go!!!

278
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,820
He is dangerous.

279
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,540
Are you ok?

280
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,780
He is not doing anything to us.

281
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,980
He is a gangster man.

282
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,940
We have to knock him off the train.

283
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:46,020
Immigration!!!! immigration!!!!

284
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:08,140
Raise your spawn "Salvatrucha" gang.

285
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,300
Homies...

286
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,500
...we have to talk about Casper.

287
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,580
We should all go and get him at once.

288
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:40,060
No Homie, water is not ready for beans yet.

289
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,460
Much less with so many fucker around.

290
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,980
They can attack the neighborhood...

291
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:52,380
...we have to run the voice, even we don't catch
him now, sooner or later the sun will light him

292
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,740
when that happens...

293
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:01,860
I am not a sissy, that's why I returned.

294
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:09,220
Then you are lucky I don't kill you smiley.

295
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,540
You seem not to have feelings
for the neighborhood, right?

296
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:20,820
If you didn't have the balls to kill Casper,
how do I know you didn't help him escape?

297
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,500
That's what happened right, you fucker?

298
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,620
I didn't do anything!!

299
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:33,260
I will dissapear you from
the neighborhood, you fucker!

300
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:43,100
Show me you are not a sissy, show me!!!

301
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:02,340
Send me, send me so I can show you
that I have feelings for the neighborhood.

302
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:10,060
Send me so I can look for him, and kill him.

303
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:25,780
Calm down "Sol", hold it, hold it man.

304
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,100
Get going now.

305
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,620
Go and kill  him if you want to stand out.

306
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:44,980
if you don't kill him, then don't even
dare to come back to the neighborhood.

307
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,740
Son of a bitch, he doesn't
even know where his dick is!!

308
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,300
We have to communicate it
to all the gangsters in L.A.

309
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,900
That dog cannot have even a shadow to hide!!

310
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,540
You going to die.

311
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,580
Thank you.

312
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,660
My name is Sayra.

313
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:47,420
I am Willie.

314
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,740
He killed Lil' Mago...

315
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:02,540
...he got warned, there is green light
to kill him, those are the rules.

316
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,420
And how are you going to kill him?

317
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:14,900
Wow!, thats so pretty! how many you got?

318
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,700
Enough to kill you all.

319
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:31,620
Kill him but hiding.

320
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,980
Sleep, I will stay awake.

321
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:36,060
You see, my family is very poor, we barely
had a little bit of beans to eat once in a while.

322
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:24,220
You are not going to wash yourself?

323
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,340
It feels good.

324
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:40,060
I don't know, maybe later.

325
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,700
When there is less people.

326
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,740
And what will you do later?

327
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:54,380
I don't know.

328
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,420
Will you stay here tonight?

329
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:19,420
If i find food around I will bring you later.

330
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:27,980
What were you talking with him?

331
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,740
We can help him.

332
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:34,420
Are you crazy?
we have to stay away from him.

333
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,260
No, you don't understand.

334
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,060
He is a killer.

335
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,460
- He is in trouble.
- I am ordering you.

336
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:44,660
But he is in trouble!

337
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:50,580
I don't care about him, I care
about you and my brother Orlando.

338
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:55,620
Look, we still have a long way to get there.

339
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:04,820
We have to be aware, we
can't let anyone separate us, ok?

340
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,060
Who is the boss?

341
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,140
I am.

342
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,180
I am Smiley from the Confetti neighborhood.

343
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:41,220
Who is the boss now in the Confetti?

344
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,260
The "Sol".

345
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,860
we knew what happened...

346
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:51,980
...are you hungry or thirsty?

347
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,460
Have you ever got into one of those?

348
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:01,700
...me neither.

349
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:09,820
In a road heading to Texas, I saw
a factory where they build them.

350
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,900
There was a letter board,
very big, with the world shape...

351
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:17,900
...and it was shiny, so beautiful.

352
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:23,260
I wanted to get on it.

353
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:30,820
when I go through there, I will
see it and it will remind me of you.

354
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,900
If you make it all the way.

355
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:37,780
I will make it... I am sure.

356
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:44,340
In Tegus I went with my friend Clarissa,
to my neighbor's house...

357
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:47,180
...a crazy old lady called Leonor...

358
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,940
...she was a witch.

359
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:56,420
She told me with scared voice,
you will make it to the U.S.

360
00:56:56,580 --> 00:57:01,580
...but not holding god's hand,
but holding the devil's spawn.

361
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:11,900
if you come with us, you can show me
the letter board you are talking about...

362
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:15,100
...we are heading to New Jersey.

363
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,860
They are coming for you right?

364
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:25,380
I think so, sooner or later they will find me...

365
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:29,380
...the gang has good memory.

366
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,340
Are you afraid?

367
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,420
To be killed?

368
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:40,980
No, I live by the day.

369
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:46,340
What worries me is not knowing
what time and which day they will kill me.

370
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:53,180
- So you have not seen him?
- No.

371
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,900
He has a teardrop tatooed here.

372
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:02,580
No, I haven't seen anyone tatooed,
since 5 days ago until now you guys.

373
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:13,180
Hey, sons of a bitch!!

374
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:17,460
I know about that guy you are looking for...

375
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:22,780
...he has a tear drop tatooed here.

376
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:30,380
Thank you!!

377
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:40,580
We have to get down...

378
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,100
What?

379
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,100
We have to get down.

380
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,060
why?

381
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:50,900
In this station, immigration is
always fucking up...

382
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,740
...and sometimes the police also.

383
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:56,460
So what do we do?

384
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:01,660
We get down and surround the train fast,
we must be alert!

385
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,940
Good day for running, uh?

386
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:32,020
Me and Smiley will go the other way...

387
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,380
...we see each other in the other side of the station.

388
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:24,980
Hey, what's up, ese?

389
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:27,460
The "M", what's your neighborhood, fucker?

390
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:31,380
Hey, look at the guy, he is from the other gang.

391
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:39,740
Take out your fucking gun Smiley!

392
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:46,940
Don't worry Homie, these
guys always miss the target...

393
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:51,020
...except this one.

394
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:53,620
Where the fuck were you Homies?

395
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:56,540
...didn't you hear the gunshots?

396
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:02,100
Yes Homie, but we almost catch Casper.

397
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:09,420
You left us behind with those
assholes, and.. where is Casper?

398
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:12,300
In the train.

399
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:16,460
I want to take that fucker down.

400
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:20,260
Get on, Smiley, you go in the front.

401
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,660
You are leaving just like that?

402
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:19,540
So what do you want?

403
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:21,660
Go with you.

404
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:39,060
Oh, God! She fucked up!!

405
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:47,940
I can't take care of you.

406
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:54,260
I am not asking you for it.

407
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:58,540
For god sake Sayra,
realize  that I am a dead man!

408
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:01,140
...don't you get it?

409
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:04,500
Don't worry Willie.

410
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:07,100
Everything will be ok.

411
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:22,060
You messed up, you don't have
any idea about the mess you are in.

412
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:40,700
Horacio, Sayra is not here.

413
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:54,940
Oh Casper, why the fuck you came here?

414
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:58,580
You are just putting me into trouble.

415
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:05,020
I can do what you are asking for,
but really, it's trouble.

416
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:08,500
I have to do some things first.

417
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:10,980
you guys hungry?

418
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:14,940
You can stay sleeping in the sofa.

419
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:17,740
Do you guys want to take a shower?

420
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:23,580
You are a little one.

421
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:28,220
Well, let me see what I've got.

422
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:34,220
I thought you didn't have family.

423
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:37,260
I don't, she is not my aunt...

424
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:40,620
...I used to take people on her territory.

425
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:42,940
And she will take us to the border?

426
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,660
Are you coming with me?

427
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:50,180
Let's see, try this on..

428
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:52,980
I hope it fits you.

429
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:54,900
The shower is over there...

430
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:57,220
...but don't get close to the window, ok?

431
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:59,500
I don't want anyone to know you are here.

432
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:20,620
What are you going to do with the girl?

433
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:26,740
I'll help her get to the border
so she can find her family over there.

434
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:31,380
And what do you get with all this?

435
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:32,900
Nothing.

436
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:37,500
Ok, Casper.

437
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:41,900
Going straight to the border...

438
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:45,660
...you know what awaits for you.

439
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:49,340
Did you know they already called me?

440
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:51,980
And what did you tell them?

441
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:56,740
Nothing, the truth, that I haven't seen you...
but they called me yesterday.

442
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:05,900
You are not going to tell them, right?

443
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:08,260
I always do the right thing.

444
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:12,020
Maybe she went down to
take a pee and the train left her.

445
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:19,100
She left.

446
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,300
So, we wait here.

447
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:30,500
We can't wait.

448
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:34,980
We have to go
or we won't get there either.

449
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:04,380
Ok, fuck!

450
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:19,220
Take this.

451
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:20,340
Thank you, aunt.

452
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:21,780
Don't thank me.

453
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:54,340
"Sol", it's a pleasure to hear you.

454
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:20,020
Are you afraid?

455
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:25,660
No, if I am with you I am ok.

456
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:35,220
The opposite, while you
are with me you are not ok.

457
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:39,340
I don't care, I trust you.

458
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,500
This scar here...

459
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:51,580
...my gang sent me to leave
a "chicken" to the border...

460
01:12:53,380 --> 01:13:00,540
...and in Tamaulipas, a cop started to shoot me...

461
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:09,340
...and here, one from the 18,
there was a fight in their territory.

462
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:16,660
This scar here is from the night that the
Homies that I have defended all my life...

463
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:22,020
...killed my love.

464
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:29,540
And I couldn't do anything for her.

465
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:37,060
Do you still trust me, Sayra?

466
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:41,820
We both know what a loss is.

467
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:48,340
All that I know, is that my
whole life has been worthless.

468
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:52,220
And that I can ruin your life too.

469
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:16,180
Get off, go away!!

470
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:36,780
I love you!

471
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,980
Come on, say it with more feeling.

472
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:43,860
It's just that I love you so much
that I don't even know what to tell you.

473
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:46,100
I don't know how to express it.

474
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:54,700
if you can measure it with
your hands, how much would it be?

475
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:59,500
It wouldn't be possible, I would need many miles...

476
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:03,780
...or the whole universe to
tell you how much I love you.

477
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:04,340
Get off, you assholes!!

478
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:11,380
Hide, hide, hide there.

479
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:46,740
Ok, this card is your pass,
it's only valid for 3 nights...

480
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:51,460
...then you have to leave to give
space to the people that just arrived.

481
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:58,020
You have two meals everyday, lunch and
dinner and please respect the rules in the wall.

482
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:39,260
We don't want low life people like
you here, you fucking gangster.

483
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:41,140
Not now.

484
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:45,220
That's the least, you can't be here!

485
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:54,220
Let him go kid, let him!

486
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:08,940
Hey, I can't believe that you are here.

487
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:11,460
Have you seen my dad and my uncle?

488
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:20,140
What?

489
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:22,380
Your uncle was deported, and......

490
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:31,100
...your father is not with us anymore.

491
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:38,380
When we are in the other side,
I want you to promise something.

492
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:40,020
What?

493
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:43,860
That no matter what, you
will look for your family in New Jersey.

494
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:53,780
Now you have to little sisters
that have no father anymore.

495
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:58,700
I would be trouble for them,
as I am for everyone.

496
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:00,660
Not for me.

497
01:23:04,740 --> 01:23:09,220
But you have to help them
in something, working.

498
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:16,340
Are you coming with me?

499
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:18,740
Yes.

500
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:40,100
I am looking for a boat.

501
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:42,300
Do you want to cross?

502
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:00,540
come on!

503
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:09,980
I can only pass one at the time.

504
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:11,420
The money?

505
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:14,220
When we cross we give it to you.

506
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:42,540
Go on fast.

507
01:24:57,580 --> 01:24:59,500
Turn around.

508
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:27,100
Hurry up and get in the water.

509
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:57,580
No... we have to go back!!!!

510
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:14,420
Let me go!

511
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:33,180
Smiley....

512
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:39,260
The gang is forever, Homie.

513
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:54,449
~ My lips became sealed at this moment...~

514
01:28:54,881 --> 01:29:00,453
~ ...when I tried to say goodbye. ~

515
01:29:00,728 --> 01:29:03,161
~ and how would my soul be if... ~

516
01:29:03,789 --> 01:29:07,164
~ ...I will live far away from you. ~

517
01:29:09,754 --> 01:29:13,246
~ Come to my side, ~

518
01:29:13,835 --> 01:29:17,484
~ ...come life of my own being. ~

519
01:29:17,759 --> 01:29:20,938
~ I want to see me in your eyes... ~

520
01:29:21,447 --> 01:29:26,275
~ ...and get drunk in the breath
that your mouth exhales... ~

521
01:29:26,510 --> 01:29:28,315
~ ...with the sweetness... ~

522
01:29:28,628 --> 01:29:33,064
~...natural from your loving soul. ~

523
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:39,538
~ That destiny forces me
with pain to let you go.~

524
01:30:09,872 --> 01:30:15,366
~ Abscent from you I will live woman... ~

525
01:30:15,444 --> 01:30:21,840
~ ...but you live in my sad heart. ~

526
01:30:23,175 --> 01:30:25,216
~ Yours is my heart. ~

527
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:30,003
~ You are the angel that came from the sky... ~

528
01:30:30,710 --> 01:30:36,752
~ ...to this tough life,
to sweeten my bitter youth. ~

529
01:30:39,735 --> 01:30:44,680
~ But if there is a disgrace... ~

530
01:30:45,346 --> 01:30:48,565
~ ...that you die, or I die... ~

531
01:30:49,075 --> 01:30:52,645
~ ...over there in the sky,
in front of the creator I'll  join you. ~
- A pay call please.

532
01:30:54,137 --> 01:30:55,117
Sayra.

533
01:31:06,301 --> 01:31:08,146
Hello?

534
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:12,855
Yessenia?
