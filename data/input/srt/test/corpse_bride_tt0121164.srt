1
00:01:52,294 --> 00:01:54,057
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

2
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:02,450
Here ye, here ye, 10 minutes to go
till Van Dort's wedding rehearsal.

3
00:02:18,086 --> 00:02:19,519
Watch it!

4
00:02:27,763 --> 00:02:30,596
- It's a beautiful day
- It's a rather nice day

5
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:32,927
A day for a glorious wedding

6
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:35,865
A rehearsal, my dear
To be perfectly clear

7
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:38,438
A rehearsal for a glorious wedding

8
00:02:38,607 --> 00:02:41,542
Assuming nothing happens
That we don't really know

9
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,110
That nothing unexpected
Interferes with the show

10
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:46,679
And that's why everything
Every last little thing

11
00:02:46,948 --> 00:02:51,681
Every single, tiny, microscopic little thing
Must go

12
00:02:51,853 --> 00:02:54,754
- According to plan
- Our son will be married

13
00:02:54,923 --> 00:02:57,016
- According to plan
- Our family carried

14
00:02:57,192 --> 00:03:00,992
Elevated to the heights of society

15
00:03:01,296 --> 00:03:03,787
- To the costume balls
- In the hallowed halls

16
00:03:03,965 --> 00:03:06,126
Rubbing elbows with the finest

17
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:08,929
Having crumpets with Her Highness

18
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:11,896
We'll be there, we'll be seen
Having tea with the queen

19
00:03:12,074 --> 00:03:15,703
We'll forget everything
That we've ever, ever been

20
00:03:17,712 --> 00:03:21,079
- Blimey! lt's my dress is caught.
- Begging your pardon, ma'am.

21
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:24,707
- Come on, dear.
- lt's not me. lt's my dress is caught.

22
00:03:24,886 --> 00:03:27,719
Where is Victor? We might be late.

23
00:03:32,694 --> 00:03:34,628
Fish merchants.

24
00:03:35,063 --> 00:03:37,759
- It's a terrible day
- Now, don't be that way

25
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:40,458
It's a terrible day for a wedding

26
00:03:40,635 --> 00:03:43,627
It's a sad, sad state of affairs we're in

27
00:03:43,805 --> 00:03:47,002
That has led to this ominous wedding

28
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:49,336
How could our family have come to this?

29
00:03:50,011 --> 00:03:52,502
To marry off our daughter
To the nouveau riche

30
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:54,171
- They're so common
- So coarse

31
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:58,149
- Oh, it couldn't be worse
- Couldn't be worse? I'm afraid I disagree

32
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,982
They could be land- rich,
Bankrupt aristocracy

33
00:04:01,156 --> 00:04:02,555
Without a penny to their name

34
00:04:02,724 --> 00:04:06,125
Just like you and me

35
00:04:06,294 --> 00:04:08,057
Oh, dear.

36
00:04:08,663 --> 00:04:11,530
And that's why everything
Every last little thing

37
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,467
Every single, tiny, microscopic little thing
Must go

38
00:04:18,907 --> 00:04:21,705
- According to plan
- Our daughter will wed

39
00:04:21,877 --> 00:04:24,778
- According to plan
- Our family led

40
00:04:24,946 --> 00:04:29,747
From the depths of deepest poverty

41
00:04:30,685 --> 00:04:33,677
- To the noble realm
- Of our ancestry

42
00:04:33,855 --> 00:04:36,688
And who would have guessed
In a million years

43
00:04:36,858 --> 00:04:40,055
- That our daughter with a face
- Of an otter in disgrace

44
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:44,756
Would provide our ticket
To a rightful place

45
00:04:51,273 --> 00:04:52,638
Oh, Hildegarde.

46
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:56,436
What if Victor and l
don't like each other?

47
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,073
As if that has anything
to do with marriage.

48
00:05:00,248 --> 00:05:03,877
Do you suppose your father and l
like each other?

49
00:05:04,052 --> 00:05:05,576
Surely you must a little?

50
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:07,686
- Of course not.
- Of course not.

51
00:05:07,856 --> 00:05:09,790
Get those corsets laced properly.

52
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,825
l can hear you speak without gasping.

53
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:21,499
You've certainly hooked a winner
this time, Victor.

54
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,436
- Now, all you have to do is reel her in.
- l'm already reeling, Mother.

55
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:28,735
Shouldn't Victoria Everglot
be marrying a lord or something?

56
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:32,243
Oh, nonsense! We're every bit
as good as the Everglots.

57
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:36,783
l always knew l deserved better
than a fish merchant's life.

58
00:05:36,952 --> 00:05:39,250
But l've never even spoken to her.

59
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:42,015
Well, at least we have that
in our favor.

60
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:46,184
Mayhew! Silence that blasted coughing.

61
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:55,194
Marriage is a partnership,
a little tit for tat.

62
00:05:55,704 --> 00:05:58,138
You'd think a lifetime watching us...

63
00:05:58,306 --> 00:06:01,002
Might have taught her that

64
00:06:01,176 --> 00:06:04,304
- Might have taught her that
- Everything must be perfect

65
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,312
- Everything must be perfect
- Everything must be perfect

66
00:06:07,482 --> 00:06:09,143
Perfect
That's why everything

67
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:10,716
Every last little thing

68
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:15,049
Every single, tiny, microscopic little thing
Must go

69
00:06:15,223 --> 00:06:19,182
According to plan

70
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:22,886
Look at the way you're standing.

71
00:06:23,064 --> 00:06:25,828
You look like you got rickets
or something...

72
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:39,576
Oh, my goodness. Oh, such grandeur!
Such impeccable taste!

73
00:06:39,748 --> 00:06:41,613
Oh, beautiful, innit?

74
00:06:43,752 --> 00:06:45,379
lt's not as big as our place, dear.

75
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,256
- Bit shabby really, isn't it?
- Shut up.

76
00:06:51,426 --> 00:06:54,190
Lord and Lady Everglot...

77
00:06:54,362 --> 00:06:58,025
...Mr. and Mrs. Van Dort.

78
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,690
Why, you must be Miss Victoria.

79
00:07:01,336 --> 00:07:05,568
Yes, l must say, you don't look a day
over 20. No. Oh, yes.

80
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:09,371
Smile, darling, smile.

81
00:07:13,948 --> 00:07:18,510
Well, hello. What a pleasure.
Welcome to our home.

82
00:07:19,054 --> 00:07:20,282
Thank you.

83
00:07:20,455 --> 00:07:23,788
We'll be taking tea
in the west drawing room.

84
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,820
Oh, do come this way,
it's just through there.

85
00:07:27,996 --> 00:07:32,228
Oh, l love what you've done with the place.
Who is your decorator?

86
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,425
Nice tiles, shame about the drapes.

87
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:38,094
My husband says such foolish things.
lgnore him.

88
00:07:38,606 --> 00:07:40,699
Yes, it's usually best.

89
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,691
- Do forgive me.
- You play beautifully.

90
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:18,134
l... l... l do apologize, Miss Everglot.
How rude of me to... Well...

91
00:09:18,873 --> 00:09:20,363
Excuse me.

92
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,073
Mother won't let me near the piano.

93
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:28,078
Music is improper for a young lady.

94
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:29,807
Too passionate, she says.

95
00:09:29,984 --> 00:09:34,785
lf l may ask, Miss Everglot...

96
00:09:34,956 --> 00:09:37,254
...where is your chaperon?

97
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:42,126
Perhaps, in...
ln view of the circumstances...

98
00:09:42,697 --> 00:09:45,461
...you could call me Victoria.

99
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:47,595
Yes, of course. Well...

100
00:09:48,403 --> 00:09:51,839
- Victoria...
- Yes, Victor.

101
00:09:53,074 --> 00:09:55,736
Tomorrow, we are to be m...

102
00:09:57,345 --> 00:09:58,676
M... M...

103
00:09:59,113 --> 00:10:03,243
- Married.
- Yes. Married.

104
00:10:04,686 --> 00:10:08,747
Since l was a child, l've...
l've dreamt of my wedding day.

105
00:10:09,357 --> 00:10:12,292
l always hoped to find someone
l was deeply in love with.

106
00:10:12,827 --> 00:10:15,660
Someone to spend
the rest of my life with.

107
00:10:16,197 --> 00:10:18,995
- Silly, isn't it?
- Yes, silly.

108
00:10:19,534 --> 00:10:22,469
No. No, not at all, no.

109
00:10:23,104 --> 00:10:25,629
Oh, dear. l'm sorry.

110
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:34,241
What impropriety is this?

111
00:10:34,415 --> 00:10:36,406
You shouldn't be alone together.

112
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:41,112
Here it is, one minute before 5,
and you're not at the rehearsal.

113
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:45,749
Pastor Galswells is waiting.
Come at once.

114
00:10:48,463 --> 00:10:51,364
Master Van Dort,
from the beginning. Again.

115
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:56,800
''With this hand,
l will lift your sorrows.

116
00:10:57,138 --> 00:11:03,008
Your cup will never empty,
for l will be your wine.

117
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:09,207
With this candle,
l will light your way in darkness.

118
00:11:09,384 --> 00:11:14,447
With this ring, l ask you to be mine.''

119
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:19,055
- Let's try it again.
- Yes. Yes, sir.

120
00:11:19,227 --> 00:11:21,627
With this candle...

121
00:11:24,032 --> 00:11:25,863
This candle...

122
00:11:27,335 --> 00:11:28,962
This candle.

123
00:11:29,804 --> 00:11:33,763
- Shall l get up there and do it for him?
- Don't get all aflutter, dear.

124
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:41,708
With this candle...

125
00:11:43,585 --> 00:11:44,813
Continue!

126
00:11:47,221 --> 00:11:49,086
Get the door, Emil.

127
00:11:49,857 --> 00:11:53,486
Let's just pick it up at the candle bit.

128
00:11:55,563 --> 00:11:57,929
A Lord Barkis, sir.

129
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:04,135
l haven't a head for dates.

130
00:12:04,305 --> 00:12:07,297
Apparently,
l'm a day early for the ceremony.

131
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:12,605
- ls he from your side of the family?
- l can't recall.

132
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,408
Emil, a seat for Lord Barkis.

133
00:12:20,855 --> 00:12:22,584
Do carry on.

134
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:28,160
Let's try it again, shall we,
Master Van Dort?

135
00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:32,527
- Yes. Yes, sir. Certainly.
- Right.

136
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,601
Right. Oh, right!

137
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,934
- With this... This...
- Hand.

138
00:12:40,108 --> 00:12:43,009
With this hand...

139
00:12:43,177 --> 00:12:44,667
...l... With...

140
00:12:44,846 --> 00:12:47,110
Three steps, three!

141
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:51,741
Can you not count? Do you not wish
to be married, Master Van Dort?

142
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,614
- No! No.
- You do not?

143
00:12:53,788 --> 00:12:57,781
No! l meant, no,
l do not not wish to be married.

144
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,359
That is, l want very much to...

145
00:13:00,528 --> 00:13:04,794
Pay attention! Have you
even remembered to bring the ring?

146
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:07,594
The ring? Yes. Of course.

147
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:13,403
- Dropping the ring.
- Oh, no, he's dropped the ring!

148
00:13:13,574 --> 00:13:17,305
- This boy doesn't want to get married.
- How disgraceful!

149
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:19,373
Excuse me. Got it!

150
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:25,281
Out of the way, you ninny.

151
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,784
Oh, dear! Oh, my! Giddy on, there's a
woman on fire! Help! Emergency!

152
00:13:32,093 --> 00:13:36,826
- Oh, l hope it doesn't stain.
- Stop fanning it, you fool.

153
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:44,764
- Get a bucket, get a bucket.
- l'm on my way, dear. Yes. Oh, dear!

154
00:13:52,814 --> 00:13:58,719
Enough! This wedding cannot take place
until he is properly prepared.

155
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:05,850
Young man, learn your vows.

156
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:24,542
Well, he's quite the catch, isn't he?

157
00:14:39,293 --> 00:14:40,988
Oh, Victoria.

158
00:14:41,462 --> 00:14:45,398
She must think l'm such a fool.
This day couldn't get any worse.

159
00:14:45,566 --> 00:14:52,200
Hear ye, hear ye! Rehearsal in ruins
as Van Dort boy causes chaos!

160
00:14:52,774 --> 00:14:56,733
Fishy fianc¨¦ could be canned!

161
00:14:56,911 --> 00:15:02,577
Everglots all fired up
as Van Dort disaster ruins rehearsal!

162
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:06,745
lt really shouldn't be all that difficult.

163
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:09,082
lt's just a few simple vows.

164
00:15:09,257 --> 00:15:13,318
With this hand, l will take your wine.

165
00:15:13,494 --> 00:15:14,893
No.

166
00:15:16,164 --> 00:15:17,825
With this hand...

167
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:19,660
...l will cup your...

168
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:21,392
Oh, goodness, no.

169
00:15:23,204 --> 00:15:25,468
With this...

170
00:15:25,973 --> 00:15:27,531
With this...

171
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,268
With this candle, l will...

172
00:15:32,013 --> 00:15:33,537
l will...

173
00:15:34,215 --> 00:15:36,342
l will set your mother on fire.

174
00:15:38,252 --> 00:15:39,947
Oh, it's no use.

175
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:57,129
With this hand,
l will lift your sorrows.

176
00:15:57,305 --> 00:16:01,969
Your cup will never empty,
for l will be your wine.

177
00:16:03,678 --> 00:16:04,940
Mrs. Everglot.

178
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,810
You look ravishing this evening.

179
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:13,746
What's that, Mr. Everglot?
Call you ''Dad''? lf you insist, sir.

180
00:16:13,921 --> 00:16:18,415
With this candle,
l will light your way in darkness.

181
00:16:18,926 --> 00:16:20,587
With this ring...

182
00:16:21,362 --> 00:16:24,957
...l ask you to be mine.

183
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:19,613
l do.

184
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:51,244
You may kiss the bride.

185
00:18:58,285 --> 00:19:01,448
- A new arrival.
- He must've fainted.

186
00:19:01,622 --> 00:19:04,420
- Are you all right?
- What...? What happened?

187
00:19:04,592 --> 00:19:07,652
By Jove, man. Looks like
we've got ourselves a breather.

188
00:19:08,095 --> 00:19:10,962
- Does he have a dead brother?
- He's still soft.

189
00:19:13,968 --> 00:19:15,595
A toast, then.

190
00:19:21,308 --> 00:19:22,900
To the newlyweds.

191
00:19:23,077 --> 00:19:24,305
Newlyweds?

192
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,375
ln the woods,
you said your vows so perfectly.

193
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,142
l did?

194
00:19:31,318 --> 00:19:32,751
l did.

195
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,150
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

196
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:40,217
Coming through, coming through.

197
00:19:40,394 --> 00:19:43,261
My name is Paul, l am the head waiter.

198
00:19:44,331 --> 00:19:47,391
l will be creating your wedding feast.

199
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:50,001
Wedding feast! l'm salivating.

200
00:19:50,971 --> 00:19:52,199
Maggots.

201
00:19:55,109 --> 00:19:56,701
Keep away!

202
00:20:01,982 --> 00:20:05,349
l've got a...
l've got a dwarf.

203
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,818
And l'm not afraid to use him.
l want some questions. Now!

204
00:20:08,989 --> 00:20:12,948
- Answers. l think you mean ''answers.''
- Thank you, yes, answers.

205
00:20:13,127 --> 00:20:16,722
l need answers.
What's going on here? Where am l?

206
00:20:16,897 --> 00:20:18,023
Who are you?

207
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:21,566
Well, that's kind of a long story.

208
00:20:22,002 --> 00:20:24,334
What a story it is.

209
00:20:24,505 --> 00:20:28,066
A tragic tale of romance, passion...

210
00:20:28,242 --> 00:20:30,039
...and murder most foul.

211
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:31,803
This is gonna be good.

212
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:35,575
Hit it, boys.

213
00:20:46,227 --> 00:20:49,822
Hey, give me a listen
You corpses of cheer

214
00:20:49,997 --> 00:20:52,727
At least those of you
Who still got an ear

215
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,698
I'll tell you a story
Make a skeleton cry

216
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,362
Of our own jubiliciously
Lovely Corpse Bride

217
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,940
Die, die, we all pass away

218
00:21:02,109 --> 00:21:04,873
But don't wear a frown
Because it's really okay

219
00:21:05,045 --> 00:21:07,570
You might try and hide
And you might try and pray

220
00:21:07,748 --> 00:21:10,842
But we all end up
The remains of the day

221
00:21:12,086 --> 00:21:13,417
That's right.

222
00:21:16,257 --> 00:21:19,749
Well, our girl was a beauty
Known for miles around

223
00:21:19,927 --> 00:21:22,862
When a mysterious stranger
Came into town

224
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,658
He was plenty good- looking
But down on his cash

225
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,734
And our poor little baby
She fell hard and fast

226
00:21:28,903 --> 00:21:31,736
When her daddy said no
She just couldn't cope

227
00:21:31,906 --> 00:21:34,466
So our lovers came up
With a plan to elope

228
00:21:35,176 --> 00:21:37,610
Die, die, we all pass away

229
00:21:37,778 --> 00:21:40,872
But don't wear a frown
Because it's really okay

230
00:21:41,048 --> 00:21:43,573
You might try and hide
And you might try and pray

231
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:46,914
But we all end up
The remains of the day

232
00:22:03,704 --> 00:22:05,194
That's right.

233
00:22:05,739 --> 00:22:09,436
Okay. Oh, yeah.
Come on, boys, pick it up.

234
00:22:10,311 --> 00:22:13,371
Yeah. Like it.

235
00:22:13,547 --> 00:22:15,447
Okay, Chancy, take it.

236
00:22:17,685 --> 00:22:18,947
Yeah.

237
00:22:28,596 --> 00:22:30,154
Yeah!

238
00:22:34,101 --> 00:22:36,001
That's nice.

239
00:22:37,805 --> 00:22:40,603
So they conjured up a plan
To meet late at night

240
00:22:40,774 --> 00:22:43,140
They told not a soul
Kept the whole thing tight

241
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,835
Now, her mother's wedding dress
Fit like a glove

242
00:22:46,013 --> 00:22:48,573
You don't need much
When you're really in love

243
00:22:48,749 --> 00:22:51,081
Except for a few things
Or so I'm told

244
00:22:51,252 --> 00:22:53,846
Like the family jewels
And a satchel of gold

245
00:22:54,021 --> 00:22:56,512
Then next to the graveyard
By the old oak tree

246
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:58,954
On a dark foggy night
At a quarter to 3

247
00:22:59,126 --> 00:23:02,562
She was ready to go
But where was he?

248
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,561
And then?

249
00:23:04,832 --> 00:23:06,663
- She waited
- And then?

250
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:09,701
- There in the shadows, was it her man?
- And then?

251
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:13,306
- Her little heart beat so loud
- And then?

252
00:23:13,774 --> 00:23:17,608
And then, baby, everything went black

253
00:23:18,078 --> 00:23:21,104
Now, when she opened her eyes
She was dead as dust

254
00:23:21,282 --> 00:23:24,149
Her jewels were missing
And her heart was bust

255
00:23:24,318 --> 00:23:26,878
So she made a vow
Lying under that tree

256
00:23:27,054 --> 00:23:29,852
That she'd wait for her true love
To come set her free

257
00:23:30,024 --> 00:23:32,857
Always waiting for someone
To ask for her hand

258
00:23:33,494 --> 00:23:36,361
Then out of the blue
Comes this groovy young man

259
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:39,260
Who vows forever
To be by her side

260
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:43,267
And that's the story
Of our Corpse Bride

261
00:23:43,437 --> 00:23:45,200
Die, die, we all pass away

262
00:23:45,372 --> 00:23:48,136
But don't wear a frown,
Because it's really okay

263
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:51,107
You might try and hide
And you might try and pray

264
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:56,875
But we all end up
The remains of the day

265
00:23:57,351 --> 00:23:58,648
Yeah.

266
00:24:10,331 --> 00:24:12,993
Victoria, come away from the window.

267
00:24:14,268 --> 00:24:16,293
Oh, l'm sure he'll be back shortly.

268
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:19,667
He's terrified of the dark.
ln fact, when he was a boy...

269
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,901
...he used to wet his combinations
regularly, didn't he, William?

270
00:24:24,078 --> 00:24:25,272
Enter.

271
00:24:29,149 --> 00:24:33,245
Lord Barkis.
l trust the room is to your liking.

272
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,981
Thank you,
you are a most gracious hostess.

273
00:24:37,157 --> 00:24:43,289
Which is why it pains me
to be the bearer of such bad news.

274
00:24:47,434 --> 00:24:51,063
Would you care
to repeat tonight's headline for us?

275
00:24:51,238 --> 00:24:53,229
Hear ye, hear ye!

276
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:58,000
Victor Van Dort seen this night on the
bridge in the arms of a mystery woman!

277
00:24:58,178 --> 00:25:02,638
The dark- haired temptress and Master
Van Dort slipped away into the night!

278
00:25:02,816 --> 00:25:04,681
And now, the weather.
Scattered showers...

279
00:25:04,852 --> 00:25:07,320
Enough! That will be all.

280
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:13,817
Mystery woman?
He doesn't even know any women!

281
00:25:13,994 --> 00:25:16,053
Or so you thought.

282
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,330
Do call for me
if you need my assistance...

283
00:25:20,701 --> 00:25:22,566
...in any way.

284
00:25:24,071 --> 00:25:27,006
Good heavens, Finis,
what should we do?

285
00:25:27,174 --> 00:25:28,664
Fetch me musket.

286
00:25:28,842 --> 00:25:30,275
William, do something.

287
00:25:30,444 --> 00:25:32,969
The town crier
probably just had a slow news day.

288
00:25:33,147 --> 00:25:35,945
You know how it is,
you need a little something to cry about.

289
00:25:36,116 --> 00:25:40,610
Regardless, we are one groom short
for the wedding tomorrow.

290
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:43,951
Not to mention
the financial implications.

291
00:25:44,124 --> 00:25:46,922
A most scandalous embarrassment
for us all.

292
00:25:47,094 --> 00:25:50,530
Oh, give us a chance to find him,
we beg of you.

293
00:25:50,697 --> 00:25:54,531
- Just give us until dawn.
- Very well. Till dawn.

294
00:25:55,235 --> 00:25:58,693
Victor, darling, where are you?

295
00:25:59,139 --> 00:26:02,802
If you ask me,
your boyfriend is kind of jumpy.

296
00:26:02,976 --> 00:26:05,376
He's not my boyfriend,
he's my husband.

297
00:26:05,546 --> 00:26:07,980
Victor, where have you gone?

298
00:26:08,315 --> 00:26:10,010
l'll keep an eye out for him.

299
00:26:10,484 --> 00:26:11,473
Victor?

300
00:26:15,722 --> 00:26:18,714
There he goes, there he goes!
He's... He's getting away!

301
00:26:18,892 --> 00:26:20,951
Quick, quick, after him!

302
00:26:21,128 --> 00:26:22,356
Victor.

303
00:26:28,035 --> 00:26:29,024
Thank you.

304
00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:30,768
Victor!

305
00:26:31,305 --> 00:26:33,296
Where are you?

306
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:36,833
Victor?

307
00:26:37,511 --> 00:26:39,536
Where have you gone?

308
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,640
Married, huh? l'm a widow.

309
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:45,614
Oh, how rude. He went that way!

310
00:26:47,321 --> 00:26:49,016
Victor.

311
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,053
Victor, darling.

312
00:26:53,594 --> 00:26:57,291
Please. There's been a mistake.
l'm not dead.

313
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:03,799
Excuse me. Excuse me.

314
00:27:04,738 --> 00:27:05,864
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

315
00:27:06,406 --> 00:27:07,930
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

316
00:27:08,742 --> 00:27:10,209
Victor.

317
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:15,239
- Dead end.
- Victor!

318
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:16,982
Hello!

319
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:28,084
Could have used the stairs, silly.

320
00:27:30,564 --> 00:27:34,762
lsn't the view beautiful?
lt takes my breath away.

321
00:27:35,969 --> 00:27:38,233
Well, it would if l had any.

322
00:27:39,907 --> 00:27:42,102
lsn't it romantic?

323
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:52,781
Look, l am terribly sorry
about what's happened to you...

324
00:27:52,953 --> 00:27:56,252
...and l'd like to help,
but l really need to get home.

325
00:27:56,423 --> 00:27:59,586
- This is your home now.
- But l don't even know your name.

326
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,218
Well, that's a great way
to start a marriage.

327
00:28:03,397 --> 00:28:04,796
Shut up!

328
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,667
- lt's Emily.
- Emily.

329
00:28:09,836 --> 00:28:13,670
Oh, l almost forgot.
l have something for you.

330
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:16,632
lt's a wedding present.

331
00:28:29,756 --> 00:28:31,053
Thank you.

332
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,242
Scraps?

333
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,083
Scraps!

334
00:28:58,652 --> 00:29:00,210
My dog, Scraps!

335
00:29:02,723 --> 00:29:05,692
Oh, Scraps, what a good boy.

336
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:08,020
l knew you'd be happy to see him.

337
00:29:08,195 --> 00:29:12,393
Who's my good boy?
Sit. Sit, Scraps, sit.

338
00:29:12,566 --> 00:29:15,831
Good boy, Scraps.
Roll over. Roll over.

339
00:29:16,003 --> 00:29:18,904
Good boy, Scraps.
Play dead.

340
00:29:20,674 --> 00:29:22,073
Sorry.

341
00:29:22,509 --> 00:29:24,136
Oh, what a cutie.

342
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:26,370
You should have seen him with fur.

343
00:29:27,214 --> 00:29:30,081
Mother never approved
of Scraps jumping up like this.

344
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:33,686
But then again,
she never approved of anything.

345
00:29:34,187 --> 00:29:36,678
Do you think
she would have approved of me?

346
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,390
You're lucky
you'll never have to meet her.

347
00:29:41,628 --> 00:29:42,925
Well, actually...

348
00:29:44,364 --> 00:29:48,198
...now that you mention it,
l think you should.

349
00:29:48,368 --> 00:29:51,360
ln fact, since we're, you know...

350
00:29:52,406 --> 00:29:55,102
...married,
you should definitely meet her.

351
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:58,273
And my father too. We should go
and see them right now.

352
00:29:58,445 --> 00:30:01,209
What a fantastic idea!
Where are they buried?

353
00:30:03,116 --> 00:30:06,279
- What? What is it?
- They're not from around here.

354
00:30:06,453 --> 00:30:07,977
Where are they?

355
00:30:08,922 --> 00:30:10,617
Oh, they're still alive.

356
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:12,918
- l'm afraid so.
- Well, that is a problem.

357
00:30:13,093 --> 00:30:14,458
What's that, Scraps?

358
00:30:15,796 --> 00:30:17,764
Oh, no, we couldn't possibly.

359
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:23,432
- Oh, well, if you put it like that.
- What?

360
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:25,328
Elder Gutknecht.

361
00:30:34,781 --> 00:30:35,770
Scraps.

362
00:30:35,949 --> 00:30:38,281
Elder Gutknecht...

363
00:30:38,685 --> 00:30:40,175
...are you there?

364
00:30:43,223 --> 00:30:46,158
Hello? ls anyone home?

365
00:30:47,027 --> 00:30:48,494
Hello?

366
00:30:59,873 --> 00:31:01,602
There you are!

367
00:31:02,275 --> 00:31:04,675
Oh, my dear. There you are.

368
00:31:04,845 --> 00:31:07,279
l've brought my husband, Victor.

369
00:31:07,447 --> 00:31:10,245
What's that? Husband?

370
00:31:10,617 --> 00:31:12,847
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

371
00:31:13,653 --> 00:31:18,090
We need to go up. Upstairs?
To visit the land of the living.

372
00:31:18,258 --> 00:31:20,488
Land of the living?

373
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,527
Oh, my dear.

374
00:31:24,695 --> 00:31:26,492
Please, Elder Gutknecht.

375
00:31:26,664 --> 00:31:30,498
Now, why go up there, when
people are dying to get down here?

376
00:31:30,668 --> 00:31:33,728
Sir, l beg you to help.
lt means so much to me...

377
00:31:34,872 --> 00:31:38,968
- Us.
- l don't know, it's just not natural.

378
00:31:39,143 --> 00:31:41,043
Please, Elder Gutknecht.

379
00:31:41,212 --> 00:31:43,840
Surely there must be something
you can do.

380
00:31:45,817 --> 00:31:48,411
Let me see what l can do.

381
00:31:48,753 --> 00:31:51,654
Where did l put that book?

382
00:31:58,329 --> 00:32:00,559
l left it here somewhere.

383
00:32:03,968 --> 00:32:06,061
There's the one.

384
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:21,376
l have it.

385
00:32:21,786 --> 00:32:26,450
A Ukrainian haunting spell.
Just the thing for these quick trips.

386
00:32:27,091 --> 00:32:30,857
- So glad you thought of this.
- Me too.

387
00:32:54,452 --> 00:32:55,851
Now, then...

388
00:32:57,054 --> 00:32:58,453
...where were we?

389
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,749
The Ukrainian haunting spell?

390
00:33:10,935 --> 00:33:13,836
Here we have it. Ready?

391
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:17,941
Just remember, when you
want to come back, say ''Hopscotch.''

392
00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:20,839
- Hopscotch?
- That's it.

393
00:33:37,361 --> 00:33:39,591
l spent so long in the darkness...

394
00:33:39,764 --> 00:33:44,463
...l'd almost forgotten how beautiful
the moonlight is.

395
00:34:11,729 --> 00:34:14,027
Hey, l think you dropped something.

396
00:34:33,184 --> 00:34:34,776
Hold on, hold on.

397
00:34:36,787 --> 00:34:41,121
l think l should prepare Mother
and Father for the big news.

398
00:34:42,827 --> 00:34:44,761
l'll go ahead and you...

399
00:34:45,596 --> 00:34:47,063
...wait here.

400
00:34:47,665 --> 00:34:50,259
- Perfect.
- l won't be long.

401
00:34:51,135 --> 00:34:54,036
Stay right here. l'll be right back.

402
00:34:54,205 --> 00:34:55,763
Okay.

403
00:34:56,507 --> 00:34:58,202
No peeking.

404
00:35:17,461 --> 00:35:20,396
lf ever l see that Van Dort boy...

405
00:35:20,564 --> 00:35:23,829
...l'll strangle him with my bare hands.

406
00:35:24,001 --> 00:35:28,165
Your hands are too fat,
and his neck is too thin.

407
00:35:28,339 --> 00:35:30,705
You'll have to use a rope.

408
00:35:40,584 --> 00:35:45,419
This is the voice of your conscience.
Listen to what I say.

409
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:49,787
I have a bad feeling about that boy.
You know he is no...

410
00:35:51,896 --> 00:35:54,262
Go chew someone else's ear for a while.

411
00:35:54,432 --> 00:35:58,163
Victor has gone to see his parents,
just like he said.

412
00:35:58,803 --> 00:36:02,671
lf l hadn't just been sitting in it,
l would say that you had lost your mind!

413
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:07,300
l'm sure he has a perfectly
good reason for taking so long.

414
00:36:07,478 --> 00:36:10,675
l am sure he does.
Why don't you go ask him?

415
00:36:10,848 --> 00:36:11,906
All right, l will.

416
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:16,645
After all, he couldn't get far
with those cold feet.

417
00:36:55,093 --> 00:36:59,086
- Victoria.
- Victor? l'm so happy to see you.

418
00:36:59,263 --> 00:37:03,256
Come by the fire. Where have you been?
Are you all right?

419
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:05,462
l... l...

420
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,001
Oh, dear.

421
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:11,434
You're as cold as death.
What's happened to you?

422
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:13,474
Your coat.

423
00:37:14,278 --> 00:37:17,179
Victoria, l confess.

424
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:21,544
This morning
l was terrified of marriage.

425
00:37:23,087 --> 00:37:27,581
But then, on meeting you,
l felt l should be with you always...

426
00:37:27,758 --> 00:37:31,956
...and that our wedding
could not come soon enough.

427
00:37:34,932 --> 00:37:38,368
Victor, l feel the same.

428
00:37:43,274 --> 00:37:45,902
Victoria, l se... l se...

429
00:37:46,077 --> 00:37:48,637
l seem to find myself married.

430
00:37:48,813 --> 00:37:51,543
And you should know it's unexpected.

431
00:37:55,419 --> 00:37:57,717
My darling,
l just wanted to meet...

432
00:38:00,491 --> 00:38:03,153
Darling? Who's this?

433
00:38:03,327 --> 00:38:06,763
- Who is she?
- l'm his wife.

434
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,724
- Victor?
- Victoria, wait. You don't understand.

435
00:38:11,202 --> 00:38:13,432
She's dead. Look.

436
00:38:17,108 --> 00:38:18,405
Hopscotch.

437
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:24,077
No! No! Victoria!

438
00:38:28,953 --> 00:38:30,921
You lied to me!

439
00:38:31,088 --> 00:38:33,579
Just to get back to that other woman.

440
00:38:33,758 --> 00:38:36,693
Don't you understand?
You're the other woman.

441
00:38:36,861 --> 00:38:41,389
No! You're married to me.
She's the other woman.

442
00:38:45,036 --> 00:38:46,799
She's got a point.

443
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:52,636
And l thought... l thought
this was all going so well.

444
00:39:01,485 --> 00:39:04,784
Look, l'm sorry, but...

445
00:39:04,956 --> 00:39:06,423
...this just can't work.

446
00:39:06,591 --> 00:39:08,525
Why not?

447
00:39:09,527 --> 00:39:11,722
lt's my eye, isn't it?

448
00:39:11,896 --> 00:39:13,557
No. Your eye is...

449
00:39:14,665 --> 00:39:15,962
...lovely.

450
00:39:16,867 --> 00:39:21,201
Listen, under different circumstances,
well, who knows?

451
00:39:21,606 --> 00:39:25,975
But we're just too different.
l mean, you're dead.

452
00:39:26,143 --> 00:39:29,169
You should've thought about that
before you asked me to marry you.

453
00:39:29,347 --> 00:39:32,874
Why can't you understand? lt was
a mistake. l would never marry you.

454
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:05,977
Roses for eternal love.

455
00:40:07,051 --> 00:40:09,451
Lilies for sweetness.

456
00:40:12,223 --> 00:40:13,781
Baby's breath.

457
00:40:19,597 --> 00:40:21,189
Why so blue?

458
00:40:21,365 --> 00:40:24,425
Maybe he's right.
Maybe we are too different.

459
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:27,196
Maybe he should
have his head examined.

460
00:40:28,739 --> 00:40:30,536
l could do it.

461
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:34,200
Or perhaps he does belong with her.
Little Miss Living.

462
00:40:34,378 --> 00:40:37,745
With her rosy cheeks and beating heart.

463
00:40:38,249 --> 00:40:42,447
Oh, those girls are ten a penny.
You've got so much more.

464
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,918
You've got... You've got...

465
00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:47,580
You've got a wonderful personality.

466
00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:59,102
What does that wispy little brat have
That you don't have double?

467
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:02,899
She can't hold a candle
To the beauty of your smile

468
00:41:03,074 --> 00:41:04,336
How about a pulse?

469
00:41:04,508 --> 00:41:05,839
Overrated by a mile

470
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,272
- Overvalued
- Overblown

471
00:41:07,511 --> 00:41:11,277
If he only knew
The you that we know

472
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:15,552
And that silly little creature
Isn't wearing his ring

473
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,121
And she doesn't play piano
Or dance, or sing

474
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,053
No, she doesn't compare

475
00:41:21,225 --> 00:41:23,489
- But she still breathes air
- Who cares?

476
00:41:23,661 --> 00:41:24,923
- Unimportant
- Overrated

477
00:41:25,096 --> 00:41:27,291
- Overblown
- If only he could see

478
00:41:27,465 --> 00:41:29,092
How special you can be

479
00:41:29,266 --> 00:41:33,293
If he only knew
The you that we know

480
00:41:39,143 --> 00:41:44,080
If I touch a burning candle
I can feel no pain

481
00:41:44,815 --> 00:41:48,546
If you cut me with a knife
It's still the same

482
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:53,256
And I know her heart is beating

483
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:56,191
And I know that I am dead

484
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,026
Yet the pain here that I feel

485
00:41:59,697 --> 00:42:02,257
Try and tell me it's not real

486
00:42:02,867 --> 00:42:07,304
And it seems that I still have
A tear to shed

487
00:42:11,776 --> 00:42:15,041
The sole redeeming feature
From that little creature

488
00:42:15,212 --> 00:42:16,577
Is that she's alive

489
00:42:16,747 --> 00:42:18,374
- Overrated
- Overblown

490
00:42:18,549 --> 00:42:21,575
Everybody knows
That's just a temporary state

491
00:42:21,752 --> 00:42:24,949
Which is cured very quickly
When we meet our fate

492
00:42:25,122 --> 00:42:26,646
- Who cares?
- Unimportant

493
00:42:26,824 --> 00:42:28,189
- Overrated
- Overblown

494
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:31,624
If only he could see
How special you can be

495
00:42:31,796 --> 00:42:36,256
If he only knew
The you that we know

496
00:42:41,539 --> 00:42:46,875
If I touch a burning candle
I can feel no pain

497
00:42:47,278 --> 00:42:51,305
In the ice or in the sun
It's all the same

498
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:55,745
Yet I feel my heart is aching

499
00:42:56,253 --> 00:42:59,051
Though it doesn't beat, it's breaking

500
00:42:59,223 --> 00:43:01,748
And the pain here that I feel

501
00:43:02,193 --> 00:43:04,457
Try and tell me it's not real

502
00:43:05,262 --> 00:43:07,924
I know that I am dead

503
00:43:08,866 --> 00:43:13,326
Yet it seems that I still have
Some tears to shed

504
00:43:22,446 --> 00:43:24,380
lt's true, Mother!

505
00:43:24,548 --> 00:43:27,312
Victor is married to a dead woman.

506
00:43:27,485 --> 00:43:32,252
l saw her. A corpse!
Standing right here with Victor.

507
00:43:32,423 --> 00:43:33,981
Victor was in your room?

508
00:43:34,158 --> 00:43:35,523
l have to help him.

509
00:43:35,693 --> 00:43:37,217
The scandal!

510
00:43:37,394 --> 00:43:41,228
Come sit in your chair, dearie.
You're shaking like a leaf.

511
00:43:41,398 --> 00:43:43,423
Let Hilde fetch you a blanket.

512
00:43:43,601 --> 00:43:47,002
Fetch her a straitjacket!
She's completely mad!

513
00:43:47,171 --> 00:43:49,036
Come, Hildegarde.

514
00:44:22,306 --> 00:44:25,241
Finis, come to bed at once.

515
00:44:45,996 --> 00:44:48,965
What in heaven's name?

516
00:44:51,569 --> 00:44:54,561
Who could that be at this hour?

517
00:44:56,106 --> 00:44:57,368
Miss Everglot.

518
00:44:57,808 --> 00:45:02,074
What are you doing here? You should be
at home, prostrate with grief.

519
00:45:02,246 --> 00:45:04,942
Pastor Galswells,
l have to ask you something.

520
00:45:05,115 --> 00:45:08,516
- This is most irregular.
- Please, l beg of you.

521
00:45:08,686 --> 00:45:13,180
You are the only one in the village who
knows of what awaits beyond the grave.

522
00:45:13,357 --> 00:45:16,087
A grim topic for a bride- to- be.

523
00:45:16,393 --> 00:45:21,228
lt is a bride l fear,
which is why l must know:

524
00:45:21,765 --> 00:45:23,960
Can the living marry the dead?

525
00:45:24,234 --> 00:45:26,998
What on earth are you speaking about?

526
00:45:27,171 --> 00:45:30,140
Please, it's Victor.
He's married to a corpse.

527
00:45:30,574 --> 00:45:32,804
He has a corpse bride!

528
00:45:32,977 --> 00:45:36,674
There must be some way
to undo what's been done.

529
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:42,052
l believe l know the thing to do.

530
00:45:42,753 --> 00:45:44,084
Come with me.

531
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:49,381
Victoria? Where are your corsets?

532
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:53,257
She's speaking in tongues.
Of unholy alliances.

533
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:55,694
Her mind has come undone, l fear.

534
00:45:55,866 --> 00:45:57,993
lt's not true! Let me go! Let me go!

535
00:45:58,168 --> 00:46:02,867
Thank you, Pastor Galswells.
Thank you so very much.

536
00:46:03,507 --> 00:46:04,838
Take her to her room!

537
00:46:05,009 --> 00:46:07,443
No, l'm telling the truth.

538
00:46:07,611 --> 00:46:09,476
Victor needs my help.

539
00:46:09,647 --> 00:46:11,877
Hildegarde, you believe me, don't you?

540
00:46:12,049 --> 00:46:14,984
- Mother, Father, please.
- Seal the doors...

541
00:46:15,152 --> 00:46:19,612
...and bar the windows. See to it that
she doesn't escape again.

542
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:24,190
He needs our help! Oh, let me go!
Let me go!

543
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:28,388
Will the mortification never cease?

544
00:46:28,565 --> 00:46:31,762
lt will be years before we can show
ourselves in public again.

545
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,197
What shall we do?

546
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:36,999
We shall continue as planned,
with or without Vincent.

547
00:46:37,174 --> 00:46:39,438
- Victor.
- Whatever.

548
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:44,343
For that boy to toss aside
a young woman like Victoria...

549
00:46:44,515 --> 00:46:46,540
...it's positively criminal.

550
00:46:46,717 --> 00:46:50,915
Why, if l had a woman
like your daughter on my arm...

551
00:46:51,088 --> 00:46:55,684
...l would lavish her with riches
befitting royalty.

552
00:46:55,859 --> 00:46:59,522
Your lady wife
is a most fortunate woman.

553
00:46:59,697 --> 00:47:02,564
Alas, l am not married.

554
00:47:02,733 --> 00:47:04,598
l was betrothed some years ago...

555
00:47:04,768 --> 00:47:08,704
...but tragedy snatched
my young bride away.

556
00:47:08,939 --> 00:47:12,932
When one lives alone,
wealth counts for naught.

557
00:47:21,051 --> 00:47:24,953
Marvelous news, Victoria,
there'll be a wedding after all.

558
00:47:25,122 --> 00:47:26,419
You found him?

559
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:30,048
Make haste, my dear,
our relatives will arrive at any moment.

560
00:47:30,227 --> 00:47:34,027
We must have you looking presentable
for Lord Barkis.

561
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:36,961
Lord Barkis?

562
00:47:37,134 --> 00:47:38,658
He will make a fine husband.

563
00:47:38,836 --> 00:47:42,169
Aye. A fortuitous turn of events indeed.

564
00:47:42,339 --> 00:47:44,603
A far better prospect this time.

565
00:47:44,775 --> 00:47:48,472
But l do not love him.
You cannot make me do this.

566
00:47:48,645 --> 00:47:51,512
- We must.
- Please, l beg of you.

567
00:47:51,682 --> 00:47:53,115
There must be another way.

568
00:47:53,283 --> 00:47:55,217
Without your marriage to Lord Barkis...

569
00:47:55,385 --> 00:47:57,876
...we shall be forced,
penniless, into the street.

570
00:47:58,055 --> 00:47:59,488
We are destitute.

571
00:47:59,923 --> 00:48:01,618
But Victor...

572
00:48:01,792 --> 00:48:04,317
Victor Van Dort has gone, child.

573
00:48:04,495 --> 00:48:07,521
You shall marry Lord Barkis tomorrow.

574
00:48:10,267 --> 00:48:12,462
- According to plan.
- According to plan.

575
00:48:41,198 --> 00:48:44,861
Oh, my dear.
Oh, don't look at me that way.

576
00:48:45,035 --> 00:48:49,369
You have only to suffer this union
until death do us part.

577
00:48:49,706 --> 00:48:53,369
And that will come sooner
than you think.

578
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,648
Oh, it's almost dawn!
Where could he be?

579
00:48:58,816 --> 00:49:01,876
Victor Van Dort elopes with corpse!

580
00:49:02,052 --> 00:49:05,749
Heartbroken bride to wed
wealthy newcomer!

581
00:49:05,923 --> 00:49:08,585
Wealthy newcomer? lt cannot be.

582
00:49:08,759 --> 00:49:10,522
Did he say corpse?

583
00:49:10,694 --> 00:49:14,528
Oh, don't be ridiculous. What corpse
would marry our Victor?

584
00:49:14,698 --> 00:49:20,694
Oh, Mayhew!
Silence that blasted coughing.

585
00:49:37,254 --> 00:49:39,848
Mayhew, are you trying to kill us?

586
00:49:40,023 --> 00:49:42,287
l think he's trying to kill us.

587
00:50:21,465 --> 00:50:22,796
l...

588
00:50:24,034 --> 00:50:25,865
...think you dropped this.

589
00:50:34,978 --> 00:50:36,309
l'm sorry.

590
00:50:36,747 --> 00:50:40,444
l'm sorry l lied to you
about wanting to see my parents.

591
00:50:40,751 --> 00:50:44,949
lt's just this whole day
hasn't gone quite, well...

592
00:50:47,591 --> 00:50:49,252
...according to plan.

593
00:51:54,825 --> 00:51:56,417
Pardon my enthusiasm.

594
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,819
l like your enthusiasm.

595
00:52:03,467 --> 00:52:06,925
- New arrival! New arrival!
- Lights up!

596
00:52:10,407 --> 00:52:11,806
Hurry up, boys!

597
00:52:14,745 --> 00:52:16,372
Drinks for everyone.

598
00:52:16,546 --> 00:52:17,638
Another pint, sir?

599
00:52:17,814 --> 00:52:19,839
- No, no. Just a half.
- No, no. Just a half.

600
00:52:25,088 --> 00:52:27,750
lt is impossible
to get good help anymore.

601
00:52:27,924 --> 00:52:30,654
Welcoming committee, coming through!
Coming through!

602
00:52:30,827 --> 00:52:35,628
- My name's Plum. Miss Plum.
- Mayhew?

603
00:52:37,134 --> 00:52:39,568
Mayhew! How nice to see...

604
00:52:41,805 --> 00:52:42,999
l'm so sorry.

605
00:52:43,173 --> 00:52:47,542
Oh, yeah. Actually, though, l feel great.

606
00:52:49,613 --> 00:52:53,481
Hurry up, boys. Can you not see
the gentleman is parched?

607
00:52:54,418 --> 00:52:57,319
Mayhew, l have to get back.

608
00:52:57,487 --> 00:53:00,047
They all must be worried sick.
How is everyone?

609
00:53:00,223 --> 00:53:04,182
Well, they're still wondering
where you slipped off to.

610
00:53:04,361 --> 00:53:06,556
Oh, and Miss Victoria...

611
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:08,288
Yes? Yes, how is she?

612
00:53:08,465 --> 00:53:11,400
Well, she's getting married
this evening.

613
00:53:11,568 --> 00:53:13,559
What? Married to who?

614
00:53:13,737 --> 00:53:17,400
Some newcomer,
Lord Somebody- or- Other.

615
00:53:17,574 --> 00:53:18,905
But that's impossible!

616
00:53:19,076 --> 00:53:21,237
Yeah, with you gone and all...

617
00:53:21,411 --> 00:53:24,778
l guess they didn't wanna
waste the cake.

618
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:27,844
But how could she?

619
00:53:28,018 --> 00:53:30,919
Women, you can't live with them.

620
00:53:31,088 --> 00:53:33,352
You can't live with...

621
00:53:35,325 --> 00:53:40,422
Time to pick up the pieces and...
You know, and move on, l suppose.

622
00:53:41,531 --> 00:53:43,658
Speaking of picking up the pieces?

623
00:53:47,104 --> 00:53:50,369
Victor? Where are you going?

624
00:53:53,543 --> 00:53:58,378
Miss Victoria, we must leave
for the church now.

625
00:53:58,782 --> 00:54:02,240
Yesterday l thought my wedding
would be happy.

626
00:54:02,452 --> 00:54:06,445
Now l feel like l'm caught
in the tide, pulled out to sea.

627
00:54:06,623 --> 00:54:10,320
The sea leads to many places, dearie.

628
00:54:11,261 --> 00:54:14,753
Maybe you'll land somewhere better.

629
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:25,132
With this candle, l will light
your way in darkness.

630
00:54:31,181 --> 00:54:36,847
With this ring,
l ask you to be mine.

631
00:54:40,657 --> 00:54:45,253
l now pronounce you man and wife.

632
00:54:45,862 --> 00:54:47,830
Oh, oh, dear.

633
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,714
l'm too late.

634
00:55:09,953 --> 00:55:12,444
Oh, Mrs. Plum, what am l to do?

635
00:55:12,622 --> 00:55:16,854
He just walked off without saying
a word. Are all men like this?

636
00:55:17,027 --> 00:55:19,894
Well, l'm afraid none of them
are very bright.

637
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,963
They get something stuck
in their heads...

638
00:55:22,132 --> 00:55:24,692
...and you can't do a thing with them.

639
00:55:25,702 --> 00:55:28,136
My dear, we have to talk.

640
00:55:28,305 --> 00:55:32,639
- Let me tell her, please. Let me tell her.
- What?

641
00:55:32,809 --> 00:55:35,869
There is a complication
with your marriage.

642
00:55:36,379 --> 00:55:37,869
l don't understand.

643
00:55:38,048 --> 00:55:42,485
The vows are binding
only until death do you part.

644
00:55:42,886 --> 00:55:44,148
What are you saying?

645
00:55:44,888 --> 00:55:47,618
Death has already parted you.

646
00:55:48,858 --> 00:55:50,689
lf he finds out, he'll leave.

647
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,885
There must be something you can do.

648
00:55:53,063 --> 00:55:55,827
Well, there is one way.

649
00:55:55,999 --> 00:55:57,899
Oh, please, please, let me tell her.

650
00:55:58,068 --> 00:56:01,094
lt requires the greatest sacrifice.

651
00:56:01,705 --> 00:56:05,072
- Go on, get to the good part.
- What is it?

652
00:56:05,242 --> 00:56:07,938
- We have to kill him!
- What?

653
00:56:08,111 --> 00:56:12,844
Victor would have to give up
the life he had forever.

654
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:17,084
He would need to repeat his vows
in the land of the living...

655
00:56:17,254 --> 00:56:20,519
...and drink from the wine of ages.

656
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:22,620
Poison!

657
00:56:22,892 --> 00:56:26,020
This would stop his heart forever.

658
00:56:26,196 --> 00:56:29,461
Only then would he be free
to give it to you.

659
00:56:32,535 --> 00:56:35,095
l could never ask him.

660
00:56:37,574 --> 00:56:39,371
You don't have to.

661
00:56:41,911 --> 00:56:43,173
l'll do it.

662
00:56:43,613 --> 00:56:46,548
My boy, if you choose this path...

663
00:56:46,716 --> 00:56:49,583
...you may never return
to the world above.

664
00:56:49,753 --> 00:56:51,311
Do you understand?

665
00:56:54,758 --> 00:56:56,726
l do.

666
00:56:57,093 --> 00:56:59,960
Gather round. Gather round, everybody.

667
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,260
We've decided to do this thing properly.

668
00:57:06,436 --> 00:57:08,836
So grab what you can and follow us.

669
00:57:09,005 --> 00:57:11,565
We're moving this wedding party upstairs.

670
00:57:11,741 --> 00:57:15,905
Upstairs? l didn't know
we had an upstairs.

671
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,639
- Sounds creepy.
- Let's go!

672
00:57:19,082 --> 00:57:22,142
A wedding, a wedding
We're going to have a wedding

673
00:57:24,821 --> 00:57:26,982
Hold on, Victor.

674
00:57:27,157 --> 00:57:30,354
You can't get married looking like that.

675
00:57:30,527 --> 00:57:33,826
The spiders think you're very cute
But goodness knows you need a suit

676
00:57:33,997 --> 00:57:37,865
But have no fears, we're quite adept
We'll have you looking lovely, lovely, lovely

677
00:57:38,034 --> 00:57:40,400
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely yet

678
00:57:41,237 --> 00:57:44,400
A little stitch, a little tuck
Some tender loving care

679
00:57:44,574 --> 00:57:47,702
A little thread will fix you up
And we've got plenty as you see

680
00:57:47,877 --> 00:57:51,244
And personally guarantee
Our quality repairs

681
00:57:51,414 --> 00:57:54,850
A little here, I'll fix the mess
We're going to do our very best

682
00:57:55,018 --> 00:57:57,612
When everybody sees you
They will all be quite impressed

683
00:57:57,787 --> 00:58:01,689
They will all be quite impressed

684
00:58:01,858 --> 00:58:03,553
A wedding, we're going to have

685
00:58:03,727 --> 00:58:06,787
A wedding cake is no mistake
It must be quite sublime

686
00:58:06,963 --> 00:58:08,726
- We're missing something
- Try some dust

687
00:58:08,898 --> 00:58:10,229
I wish I had more time

688
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,301
Perhaps there's something I can do
These bones might help a bit

689
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:15,301
- Oh, my nose.
- Sorry.

690
00:58:15,472 --> 00:58:16,734
Wait a minute, that's it

691
00:58:16,906 --> 00:58:18,305
- A little of that
- A little of this

692
00:58:18,475 --> 00:58:20,170
The perfect cake is hard to miss

693
00:58:20,377 --> 00:58:22,641
A wedding, a wedding
We're going to have

694
00:58:22,812 --> 00:58:24,109
A wedding

695
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,907
Huzzah, huzzah

696
00:58:26,082 --> 00:58:28,607
We're going to have a wedding
A wedding

697
00:58:29,252 --> 00:58:35,054
Let's all give out a cheer
'Cause the bride is getting married today

698
00:58:36,326 --> 00:58:39,261
One thing you can surely say
Is we will stand beside

699
00:58:39,429 --> 00:58:42,330
Until the end we will defend
Our one and only bride

700
00:58:42,499 --> 00:58:45,696
Our bride- to- be, our bride- to- be
Our lovely Corpse Bride

701
00:58:45,869 --> 00:58:47,666
Huzzah! Hooray! Huzzah! Hooray!

702
00:58:47,837 --> 00:58:52,069
Our bride is getting married today

703
00:58:52,242 --> 00:58:54,267
- Oh, there she is.
- Here she comes.

704
00:58:59,482 --> 00:59:03,145
Oh, oh, the bride is here

705
00:59:03,319 --> 00:59:07,119
She's waited for this day
For many a year

706
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:11,454
For this day, for this day
Our hopes and our pride

707
00:59:11,628 --> 00:59:17,828
The bride is here
Here comes the bride

708
00:59:18,034 --> 00:59:21,993
Here comes the bride
Here comes the bride

709
00:59:22,238 --> 00:59:26,174
For this day, for this day
Will last forever

710
00:59:26,342 --> 00:59:30,142
And all of her friends
Will work together

711
00:59:30,313 --> 00:59:34,010
To make it the perfect day
She's always dreamed

712
00:59:34,184 --> 00:59:41,420
Our hopes and our pride
Our bride, our lovely bride

713
00:59:42,058 --> 00:59:44,822
We're going to have a party
Like nobody's ever seen

714
00:59:44,994 --> 00:59:48,691
The living in the land above
Will not know where they've been

715
00:59:48,865 --> 00:59:55,498
The land above
The party of the bride

716
00:59:56,339 --> 01:00:02,141
Here comes the bride
On this glorious day of days

717
01:00:02,312 --> 01:00:07,045
Up to the land of the living

718
01:00:07,217 --> 01:00:15,022
To celebrate

719
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,951
Oh, dear.

720
01:00:31,407 --> 01:00:34,808
Quiet down now, everyone.

721
01:00:39,315 --> 01:00:40,782
Thank you.

722
01:00:41,818 --> 01:00:46,312
Elegant, cultured, radiant.

723
01:00:46,956 --> 01:00:49,720
Victoria has found a husband...

724
01:00:49,893 --> 01:00:54,057
...with all these qualities and more.

725
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:56,824
Serendipity brought us together...

726
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,302
...and no force on earth
could tear us apart.

727
01:01:22,825 --> 01:01:25,157
There's an eye in me soup.

728
01:01:34,671 --> 01:01:35,660
Oh, sorry.

729
01:01:42,745 --> 01:01:43,939
Fetch me musket!

730
01:01:44,113 --> 01:01:46,240
Fetch your own musket. l'm off!

731
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:48,646
Coming through. Coming through.

732
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:56,654
Excuse me, you don't know me,
but l used to live in your dead mother.

733
01:01:57,961 --> 01:01:59,588
Hey, hold on there.

734
01:02:00,096 --> 01:02:03,623
l love a woman with meat on her bones.

735
01:02:04,867 --> 01:02:07,427
Finis, who invited these people?

736
01:02:08,404 --> 01:02:10,497
They must be from your side
of the family.

737
01:02:10,673 --> 01:02:11,935
Certainly not.

738
01:02:12,108 --> 01:02:16,067
Why, if my Grandfather Everglot could
see this, he'd be turning in his grave.

739
01:02:16,245 --> 01:02:18,179
Finis.

740
01:02:19,682 --> 01:02:21,877
Where do you keep the spirits?

741
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:34,890
ln other news, the dead walk the earth!

742
01:02:39,636 --> 01:02:43,333
Get back! Don't try
and sneak up on me!

743
01:02:43,506 --> 01:02:44,973
Get back!

744
01:02:46,342 --> 01:02:48,173
l'll give you such a wallop.

745
01:02:59,722 --> 01:03:00,984
No.

746
01:03:01,157 --> 01:03:02,522
Yeah.

747
01:03:17,006 --> 01:03:18,803
Grandpa?

748
01:03:22,412 --> 01:03:23,936
- Bounder!
- Sweetie pie.

749
01:03:24,113 --> 01:03:25,546
- Monster.
- Buttercup.

750
01:03:25,715 --> 01:03:27,512
- Cad!
- Gertrude!

751
01:03:27,984 --> 01:03:29,508
Alfred?

752
01:03:31,187 --> 01:03:34,088
You've been dead for 15 years.

753
01:03:34,257 --> 01:03:38,125
Frankly, my dear, l don't give a damn.

754
01:03:38,294 --> 01:03:40,057
Ethel!

755
01:03:50,406 --> 01:03:52,203
Wait. That's it.

756
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:55,776
We're going to take whatever money
we can and get out of here.

757
01:03:55,945 --> 01:03:58,379
Money? What money?

758
01:03:58,548 --> 01:04:00,914
Your dowry. lt's my right!

759
01:04:01,084 --> 01:04:03,075
But my parents don't have any money.

760
01:04:03,252 --> 01:04:07,951
lt's my marriage to you that will
save them from the poorhouse.

761
01:04:08,124 --> 01:04:10,217
Th... The poorhouse?

762
01:04:10,693 --> 01:04:14,527
You're lying. lt isn't true.
Tell me that you're lying!

763
01:04:14,697 --> 01:04:18,497
Did things not go according
to your plan, Lord Barkis?

764
01:04:18,668 --> 01:04:23,469
Well, perhaps in disappointment
we are perfectly matched.

765
01:04:42,291 --> 01:04:45,089
Be gone, ye demons from hell!

766
01:04:45,261 --> 01:04:49,322
Back to the void
from whence you came!

767
01:04:49,499 --> 01:04:51,296
You shall not enter here.

768
01:04:51,467 --> 01:04:54,027
Back, back!

769
01:04:54,203 --> 01:04:56,433
Keep it down, we're in a church.

770
01:04:56,606 --> 01:04:58,506
Evening.

771
01:05:35,011 --> 01:05:37,309
Dearly beloved and departed...

772
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:43,180
...we are gathered here today to join
this man and this corpse in marriage.

773
01:05:46,522 --> 01:05:48,490
Victor?

774
01:05:50,459 --> 01:05:51,926
Living first.

775
01:05:53,996 --> 01:05:55,554
With this hand...

776
01:05:56,332 --> 01:05:58,823
...l will lift your sorrows.

777
01:06:00,436 --> 01:06:02,700
Your cup will never empty...

778
01:06:03,239 --> 01:06:05,230
...for l will be your wine.

779
01:06:06,142 --> 01:06:07,404
Now you.

780
01:06:12,582 --> 01:06:14,641
With this hand...

781
01:06:14,817 --> 01:06:17,115
...l will lift your sorrows.

782
01:06:18,621 --> 01:06:21,784
Your cup will never empty.

783
01:06:23,559 --> 01:06:25,584
For l will be...

784
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,895
l will be...

785
01:06:34,804 --> 01:06:36,431
Go on, my dear.

786
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:38,802
Your cup...

787
01:06:39,508 --> 01:06:41,567
...will never empty...

788
01:06:43,779 --> 01:06:45,713
...for l will be...

789
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:50,045
l will be your wine.

790
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:56,282
She's having second thoughts.

791
01:06:59,395 --> 01:07:00,487
l can't.

792
01:07:01,163 --> 01:07:02,858
What's wrong?

793
01:07:04,166 --> 01:07:05,963
This is wrong.

794
01:07:07,203 --> 01:07:09,296
l was a bride.

795
01:07:09,772 --> 01:07:12,366
My dreams were taken from me.

796
01:07:13,175 --> 01:07:14,802
Well, now...

797
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:18,371
Now l've stolen them
from someone else.

798
01:07:19,115 --> 01:07:21,606
l love you, Victor.

799
01:07:22,919 --> 01:07:25,285
But you're not mine.

800
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:31,922
Victoria!

801
01:07:46,742 --> 01:07:49,870
Oh, how touching.

802
01:07:50,046 --> 01:07:52,844
l always cry at weddings.

803
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:58,484
Our young lovers together at last.

804
01:07:58,654 --> 01:08:02,613
Surely now they can live
happily ever after.

805
01:08:03,659 --> 01:08:05,286
But you forget...

806
01:08:05,494 --> 01:08:07,587
...she's still my wife!

807
01:08:07,763 --> 01:08:10,391
l'll not leave here empty- handed!

808
01:08:11,767 --> 01:08:12,927
You?

809
01:08:15,905 --> 01:08:17,338
Emily?

810
01:08:17,506 --> 01:08:18,700
You!

811
01:08:18,874 --> 01:08:21,866
But... But... l left you.

812
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:24,776
For dead.

813
01:08:25,581 --> 01:08:27,412
This woman is obviously delusional!

814
01:08:35,091 --> 01:08:38,390
Sorry to cut things short,
but we must be on our way.

815
01:08:38,561 --> 01:08:40,927
Take your hands off her.

816
01:08:41,931 --> 01:08:44,729
Do l have to kill you too?

817
01:08:48,104 --> 01:08:51,130
Victor, catch!

818
01:08:51,774 --> 01:08:53,264
Sorry.

819
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:10,256
l say, you're not playing fair, sir.

820
01:09:52,101 --> 01:09:54,001
Touch¨¦, my dear.

821
01:09:54,603 --> 01:09:55,934
Get out.

822
01:09:56,672 --> 01:09:59,470
Oh, l'm leaving.

823
01:10:03,979 --> 01:10:06,971
But first a toast. To Emily.

824
01:10:07,149 --> 01:10:11,586
Always the bridesmaid, never the bride.

825
01:10:12,054 --> 01:10:13,715
Tell me, my dear...

826
01:10:13,889 --> 01:10:17,950
...can a heart still break
once it's stopped beating?

827
01:10:20,963 --> 01:10:22,430
Let me at him! Let me at him!

828
01:10:22,598 --> 01:10:24,156
- No, don't hold me back.
- Wait.

829
01:10:25,434 --> 01:10:28,062
We must abide by their rules.

830
01:10:28,237 --> 01:10:31,434
We are amongst the living.

831
01:10:31,607 --> 01:10:33,472
Well said.

832
01:10:49,391 --> 01:10:51,359
Not anymore.

833
01:10:54,897 --> 01:10:57,798
Yep, you're right. He's all yours.

834
01:11:09,145 --> 01:11:11,204
New arrival.

835
01:11:17,887 --> 01:11:21,846
Oh, Victor,
l never thought l'd see you again.

836
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:30,688
Wait.

837
01:11:31,467 --> 01:11:33,697
l made a promise.

838
01:11:36,405 --> 01:11:38,999
You kept your promise.

839
01:11:39,842 --> 01:11:41,810
You set me free.

840
01:11:52,655 --> 01:11:55,681
Now l can do the same for you.
