2
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,470
He even took the gramophone on safari.

3
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:58,474
Three rifles, supplies for a month,

4
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,060
and Mozart.

5
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,398
He began our friendship with a gift.

6
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,237
And later, not long before Tsavo,

7
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:17,325
he gave me another.
An incredible gift.

8
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,371
A glimpse of the world
through God's eye.

9
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,499
And I thought,

10
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,502
"Yes, I see.

11
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,006
"This is the way
it was intended."

12
00:01:35,511 --> 00:01:37,596
I've written about all the others,

13
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,681
not because I loved them less,

14
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,518
but because they were clearer, easier.

15
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,856
He was waiting for me there.

16
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:55,238
But I've gone ahead of my story.
He'd have hated that.

17
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:58,741
Denys loved to hear a story told well.

18
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:02,411
You see,

19
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:08,250
I had a farm in Africa at the
foot of the Ngong Hills.

20
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,420
But it began before that.

21
00:02:11,922 --> 00:02:14,298
It really began in Denmark.

22
00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:24,141
And there I knew two brothers.

23
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:28,103
One was my lover,
and one was my friend.

24
00:02:28,188 --> 00:02:29,730
It's too cold for champagne.

25
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:31,732
It's too cold for anything but.

26
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:39,031
You said you'd be at Klampenborg.

27
00:02:39,115 --> 00:02:41,909
I thought I'd come, but then I didn't.

28
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,496
Was it fun?

29
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:51,167
Tanne.

30
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:54,212
Tanne, come on.

31
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:57,423
It's not as though you loved him.

32
00:02:57,508 --> 00:02:59,801
You'd like to be
a baroness, that's all.

33
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:00,844
He lied to me.

34
00:03:00,928 --> 00:03:02,011
Of course.

35
00:03:02,096 --> 00:03:04,639
Would you be in bed
with him otherwise?

36
00:03:04,723 --> 00:03:07,600
My brother's only dull,
but not stupid.

37
00:03:11,772 --> 00:03:13,064
Pretend it's Hans.

38
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,402
Where would you go?

39
00:03:17,486 --> 00:03:18,528
Anywhere.

40
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:22,490
America. Ceylon.
I would even go to Australia.

41
00:03:24,118 --> 00:03:27,745
Perhaps not Australia.
But I've got to be away from here.

42
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,873
I'll give you all I've got.

43
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,125
That should get you into town.

44
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:34,127
God, it was fun. Money.

45
00:03:35,504 --> 00:03:37,213
You could marry me.

46
00:03:37,464 --> 00:03:39,674
I have to marry a virgin.
I can't stand criticism.

47
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:42,801
For the money, I mean.

48
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:47,014
Probably.

49
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,475
Listen to me.
I've got no life at all.

50
00:03:50,768 --> 00:03:54,938
They wouldn't teach me anything
useful, and now I've failed to marry.

51
00:03:55,023 --> 00:03:58,692
You know the punishment for that.
"Miss Dinesen's at home."

52
00:03:59,027 --> 00:04:01,194
And you've gone through
all your money.

53
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:05,198
You're off seducing the servant girls.
We're a pair, you and I.

54
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:09,661
I mean, at least we're friends.
We might be all right,

55
00:04:09,746 --> 00:04:13,248
and if we weren't, at least
we'd have been somewhere.

56
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,668
You don't think
you're being too romantic?

57
00:04:24,385 --> 00:04:27,012
Am I supposed to think you're serious?

58
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:32,768
I had a farm in Africa.

59
00:04:36,438 --> 00:04:41,067
I had a farm in Africa at the
foot of the Ngong Hills.

60
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:47,031
I had a farm in Africa.

61
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:41,911
Good morning.

62
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,412
Have you had trouble?

63
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:44,997
Now and then.
Have you?

64
00:07:45,457 --> 00:07:47,458
I'm traveling to Nairobi.

65
00:07:47,543 --> 00:07:49,335
You caught the right train then.

66
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,422
Get away from there!

67
00:07:56,218 --> 00:07:58,678
That's all my crystal, my Limoges.

68
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:01,848
They didn't know it was Limoges.

69
00:08:05,726 --> 00:08:07,435
You plan to stay then?

70
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,689
I've come out to marry Baron Blixen.
Do you know him?

71
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,232
Bror? Yes.

72
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,359
We plan to start a dairy.

73
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,363
Are you quite famous?
They stopped the train for you.

74
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:20,323
It's rude not to here.

75
00:08:21,242 --> 00:08:24,703
A dairy? Isn't it a bit soon for that?
Milk at the door?

76
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:28,999
Aren't you boarding?

77
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,333
I'm going on.

78
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:31,918
On? To where?

79
00:08:32,003 --> 00:08:35,755
Mention the ivory to Berkeley Cole.
Bror knows him.

80
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,424
I'm Baroness Blixen!

81
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:39,176
Not yet.

82
00:08:40,303 --> 00:08:42,053
Finch Hatton, Denys!

83
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:51,855
I am Farah Aden.
We can go now.

84
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:53,190
Where is Baron Blixen?

85
00:08:53,274 --> 00:08:55,942
He is at Muthaiga.
Please come.

86
00:09:06,036 --> 00:09:07,703
Where is Muthaiga?

87
00:09:08,288 --> 00:09:11,999
Muthaiga is a club where British
go for drinking. Please.

88
00:09:20,634 --> 00:09:24,845
Listen, on the train are my
crates with china and crystal.

89
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,722
Do you know china?

90
00:09:26,806 --> 00:09:29,808
Yes. China, it can break.

91
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,979
Stay.

92
00:10:29,994 --> 00:10:33,371
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Baron Blixen.

93
00:10:42,297 --> 00:10:43,463
I wondered if you might tell me...

94
00:10:43,548 --> 00:10:45,424
Memsahibs must not be here.

95
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,302
I'm simply looking for someone...

96
00:10:48,386 --> 00:10:50,095
Memsahibs must not be here.

97
00:11:00,189 --> 00:11:01,356
Where have you been?

98
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:02,566
Where have you been?

99
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,278
Arranging things. How was the trip?
You can tell me later.

100
00:11:07,572 --> 00:11:08,739
Would you like to change?

101
00:11:08,823 --> 00:11:10,532
My luggage is still on the train.

102
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:12,617
Room "D."
Head of the stairs.

103
00:11:12,702 --> 00:11:14,953
I haven't gotten a ring.
Do you care?

104
00:11:15,038 --> 00:11:16,371
Did you think I wouldn't come?

105
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:18,707
I thought you wouldn't
want to spend the money.

106
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,168
You will love it here.
The servants are wonderful.

107
00:11:21,252 --> 00:11:22,336
Shall we get a drink?

108
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,588
We've got almost one
hour before the wedding.

109
00:11:24,672 --> 00:11:25,839
One hour?

110
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:38,351
Is this all right?

111
00:11:38,435 --> 00:11:39,935
I wondered what color you'd choose.

112
00:11:40,604 --> 00:11:43,981
It's ivory. God,
I've got this man's ivory.

113
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:45,149
Whose ivory?

114
00:12:04,252 --> 00:12:07,797
I'm Sarah, Lady Belfield.
Shall I stand up for you?

115
00:12:08,298 --> 00:12:09,590
Short or long, Blix?

116
00:12:09,674 --> 00:12:12,426
Long, please.
Give me time to adjust to it.

117
00:12:14,137 --> 00:12:15,763
Settle down, all.

118
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,100
By the authority of His Majesty's
Government vested in me,

119
00:12:19,184 --> 00:12:23,854
I declare that the Baron Bror Von
Blixen, citizen of Sweden and...

120
00:12:25,941 --> 00:12:27,148
What's your name, my dear?

121
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:28,858
Damn it, Henry, I told you her name.

122
00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:31,111
Karen Christentze Dinesen.

123
00:12:31,195 --> 00:12:35,198
Karen Christentze Dinesen, a female
subject of the King of Denmark,

124
00:12:35,282 --> 00:12:37,492
are henceforth united man and wife.

125
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,163
God save this company,
God save the King.

126
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,290
God save the King!

127
00:12:47,711 --> 00:12:49,003
Thank you for this.

128
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,633
"Did you hear about Shuttleworth?
" "No," I said.

129
00:12:53,717 --> 00:12:57,220
"He's living up country," he
says, "in a tree with a baboon."

130
00:12:57,304 --> 00:13:01,099
"Male or female?" I said to him.
"Female, of course," he says.

131
00:13:01,183 --> 00:13:03,435
"There's nothing queer
about old Shuttleworth."

132
00:13:05,729 --> 00:13:07,647
Where's your muddleheaded husband?

133
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:09,023
The Governor's at the punch bowl,

134
00:13:09,108 --> 00:13:11,651
thank you, hoping to avoid you.

135
00:13:11,735 --> 00:13:13,361
Would you like to meet the bride?

136
00:13:13,446 --> 00:13:15,238
Or did you come just for the whiskey?

137
00:13:15,656 --> 00:13:17,907
Not for the company, God knows.

138
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:21,410
Lord Delamere, may I
present Baroness Blixen.

139
00:13:21,661 --> 00:13:25,581
Baroness Blixen, Lord
Delamere, such as he is.

140
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,917
Baroness.
A Swede, are you?

141
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:31,336
No, Danish, actually.

142
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:33,881
The little country next to Germany.

143
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,885
If it comes to war,
where will Denmark stand?

144
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:42,848
On its own, I hope.
We do have that history.

145
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,142
Is there something we can call you

146
00:13:45,226 --> 00:13:47,060
that gets round this Baroness?

147
00:13:47,145 --> 00:13:49,021
What do they call you?

148
00:13:49,522 --> 00:13:51,398
D, if I'm lucky.

149
00:14:02,744 --> 00:14:06,079
My stupid name's Felicity,
but I do like your dress.

150
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:08,248
Thank you.

151
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,667
It's not much of a hat.

152
00:14:10,752 --> 00:14:12,752
It's meant to be stunning.

153
00:14:13,795 --> 00:14:15,755
We die of sunstroke here.

154
00:14:16,298 --> 00:14:18,716
At least I'm safe from the mosquitoes.

155
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:20,927
The big ones.

156
00:14:24,723 --> 00:14:26,182
You nervous?

157
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,850
Should I be?

158
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:32,480
You know, wedding night and all that.

159
00:14:48,747 --> 00:14:52,208
So they're both of them naked
and not a shrub in sight.

160
00:14:53,752 --> 00:14:55,545
Have you met Vicky Gresham?

161
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:58,297
Hello, Baroness,
I'd curtsy but I'm drunk.

162
00:15:00,425 --> 00:15:01,509
May I see you, please?

163
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:02,760
Excuse me.

164
00:15:05,263 --> 00:15:06,930
If you want any friends, Tanne,

165
00:15:07,014 --> 00:15:09,140
I'd make them here.
There is no one else.

166
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:11,851
I want to see my house.

167
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:17,315
You may want to change.
It's a two-hour ride.

168
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:29,828
Excuse me.

169
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:44,843
My God, these people drink.

170
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,512
I'm sorry, I was just...

171
00:15:49,098 --> 00:15:50,098
It's all right.

172
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,267
I'm afraid you've caught me snooping.

173
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,437
It's not my room, it's Denys',
and Denys won't mind.

174
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,730
It's a thing about Denys,
he doesn't mind.

175
00:15:57,814 --> 00:16:00,524
Are you Cole?

176
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,361
I brought the ivory
with me on the train.

177
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:05,863
Well, thank you.

178
00:16:08,116 --> 00:16:09,450
Are you taking your quinine?

179
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:10,784
Oh, yes.

180
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:15,873
He has got lovely books.
Does he lend them?

181
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,751
We had a friend, Hopworth.

182
00:16:20,128 --> 00:16:23,380
He got a book and didn't return it.
Denys was furious.

183
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:26,759
I said, "Denys, you wouldn't lose
a friend over a book, would you?"

184
00:16:26,843 --> 00:16:28,510
And he said, "No!

185
00:16:29,137 --> 00:16:31,055
"But he has, hasn't he?"

186
00:16:34,768 --> 00:16:36,602
Did you come out through London?

187
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:38,729
From Rome actually.

188
00:16:38,813 --> 00:16:41,315
I thought you might have a newspaper.

189
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,817
No, sorry.

190
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,819
Nothing in them anyway.

191
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:51,658
I had a friend who I used to
take to the dances at Oxford.

192
00:16:51,742 --> 00:16:54,077
They were in June by the river.

193
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:58,331
She always wore a new silk dress.

194
00:16:58,582 --> 00:17:01,084
I think you're wearing her perfume.

195
00:17:09,677 --> 00:17:13,513
No, it's very nice,
but it's not the same.

196
00:17:16,016 --> 00:17:17,392
We can go now.

197
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,161
This is Belknap.
He runs the farm.

198
00:18:19,954 --> 00:18:21,663
Good evening, ma'am.

199
00:18:27,837 --> 00:18:30,547
This is your cook.
Name is Esa.

200
00:18:37,512 --> 00:18:40,097
And this is Juma. Houseboy.

201
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,898
Come, see your house.

202
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:53,402
When you leave me, I'm
going to marry Berkeley Cole.

203
00:18:53,487 --> 00:18:54,987
A man in trade.

204
00:18:55,322 --> 00:18:56,947
Is that what he does?

205
00:18:57,032 --> 00:19:00,618
He is thick with the Somalis.
There's a crowd of them up on his land

206
00:19:00,702 --> 00:19:02,703
who think he's some sort of prince.

207
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:04,830
He sells Finch Hatton's ivory.

208
00:19:05,665 --> 00:19:08,125
Belknap is a cheery sort.

209
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:11,962
Had a place of his own.
Went belly up trying to grow flax.

210
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,549
Does he know cattle?

211
00:19:15,884 --> 00:19:20,262
I didn't buy cattle.
We're going to grow coffee instead.

212
00:19:28,354 --> 00:19:30,438
That's not what we planned.

213
00:19:30,856 --> 00:19:33,483
You were in Denmark, I had to decide.

214
00:19:33,734 --> 00:19:35,693
We made a decision.

215
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:38,404
We don't know anything about coffee.

216
00:19:38,572 --> 00:19:40,156
You plant it, it grows.

217
00:19:40,241 --> 00:19:42,408
My mother put her money
up to do a dairy.

218
00:19:42,493 --> 00:19:46,496
She doesn't care whether it's cows
or coffee as long as it pays.

219
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,665
You must be with a herd
or things go wrong.

220
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:51,751
I didn't come to Africa
to sit with silly cows.

221
00:19:51,836 --> 00:19:54,337
Just tell her we changed our minds.

222
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,217
Next time you change your mind,
you do it with your money.

223
00:20:01,303 --> 00:20:04,430
They bought you a title.
They didn't buy me.

224
00:20:07,893 --> 00:20:11,229
Fetch some wine
for my lover's brother.

225
00:20:16,944 --> 00:20:18,694
I think you're tired.

226
00:20:25,535 --> 00:20:26,952
Be careful.

227
00:20:32,584 --> 00:20:35,335
Did I tell you
Hans came to say goodbye?

228
00:20:54,772 --> 00:20:56,315
Where is Baron Blixen?

229
00:20:56,983 --> 00:20:58,525
He's gone to hunt.

230
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,320
Did he say when he would be back?

231
00:21:01,404 --> 00:21:03,530
He says he can come before the rain.

232
00:21:05,241 --> 00:21:07,284
Is it going to rain today?

233
00:21:08,578 --> 00:21:11,162
It can be many days before the rains.

234
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:46,948
In Ohio we put up scarecrows
to keep the birds away.

235
00:21:47,032 --> 00:21:50,159
Here you hope there're enough
leopards to keep down the baboons.

236
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:52,703
'Course they'll take your dog, too.
That's Africa.

237
00:21:52,788 --> 00:21:54,121
How much will we plant?

238
00:21:54,665 --> 00:21:55,790
1, 000 acres, the Baron says.

239
00:21:55,874 --> 00:21:57,458
How long will that take?

240
00:21:57,542 --> 00:22:01,212
That depends on Kinanjui.
He's the chief of the Kikuyu.

241
00:22:01,296 --> 00:22:03,047
Got a deal with him to get you help.

242
00:22:03,131 --> 00:22:05,256
When will be our first harvest?

243
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:09,844
These are seedlings.
It'll be three, maybe four years.

244
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:12,055
Four years!

245
00:22:12,223 --> 00:22:15,850
If they bear at all.
No one's ever tried coffee this high.

246
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:20,021
And what are we going to
live on for four years?

247
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:23,733
I'm working to get home.
Now, if you haven't got it,

248
00:22:23,818 --> 00:22:25,568
it'd be good if you could
tell me right now.

249
00:22:28,197 --> 00:22:30,031
We will plant 500.

250
00:22:32,743 --> 00:22:36,830
Chief Kinanjui, I have heard
that you are a wise chief...

251
00:22:36,914 --> 00:22:41,042
Not now, please.
And I look forward to our dealings.

252
00:22:42,211 --> 00:22:44,421
Your Kikuyu are good workers.

253
00:22:44,588 --> 00:22:49,342
I look forward to dealing with
them honestly, and fairly.

254
00:22:49,927 --> 00:22:52,137
This chief has no British.

255
00:22:55,682 --> 00:22:57,891
Tell him that I am Baroness Blixen.

256
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,768
This chief knows that.

257
00:23:02,522 --> 00:23:04,356
Tell him what I said.

258
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,475
What did he say?

259
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:41,810
He says these Kikuyu can do this work.

260
00:23:46,232 --> 00:23:48,191
Farah, what else did he...

261
00:24:09,755 --> 00:24:11,631
Your leg is very sick.

262
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:17,303
You must come to the
house for medicine.

263
00:24:19,223 --> 00:24:20,807
Does he understand me?

264
00:24:20,974 --> 00:24:21,974
Yes.

265
00:24:25,771 --> 00:24:29,357
If you don't come, the other
boys will say you are afraid.

266
00:24:33,695 --> 00:24:36,364
I myself will think
only that you are foolish.

267
00:24:37,449 --> 00:24:40,034
This boy must come to
my house for treatment.

268
00:24:40,785 --> 00:24:42,035
See that he does.

269
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,165
What else did Kinanjui say?

270
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:50,669
He says coffee must
not grow this high.

271
00:24:52,046 --> 00:24:55,006
Never mind.
He's a chief, but he's a Kikuyu.

272
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:33,711
If you put a dam here to stop the
water then I can make a pond here.

273
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,462
Do you know how to make a pond?

274
00:25:35,547 --> 00:25:37,423
This water must go home to Mombasa.

275
00:25:37,507 --> 00:25:40,092
It can go home after we make a pond.

276
00:25:40,927 --> 00:25:43,012
This water lives at Mombasa.

277
00:25:48,768 --> 00:25:50,186
Come, then.

278
00:26:59,838 --> 00:27:01,464
I wouldn't run.

279
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:06,469
If you do, she'll think
you're something good to eat.

280
00:27:09,348 --> 00:27:11,307
Do you have a gun?

281
00:27:11,684 --> 00:27:13,434
She won't like the smell of you.

282
00:27:13,852 --> 00:27:15,186
Shoot it.

283
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,355
She's had breakfast.

284
00:27:22,568 --> 00:27:24,194
Please shoot her.

285
00:27:24,404 --> 00:27:26,363
Let's give her a moment.

286
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,366
Oh, my God, shoot her!

287
00:27:39,377 --> 00:27:42,754
Just how much closer did you
expect to let her come?

288
00:27:43,047 --> 00:27:47,259
A bit. She wanted to see if you'd run.
That's how they decide.

289
00:27:47,385 --> 00:27:48,719
A lot like people that way.

290
00:27:48,845 --> 00:27:50,178
She almost had me for lunch.

291
00:27:50,263 --> 00:27:52,306
It wasn't her fault.
She's a lion.

292
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,473
It wasn't mine.

293
00:27:53,558 --> 00:27:56,226
Doesn't that outfit come with a rifle?

294
00:27:56,436 --> 00:27:58,520
It's on my saddle.

295
00:27:58,688 --> 00:28:01,398
Better keep it with you.
Your horse isn't much of a shot.

296
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:04,901
For Berkeley.
He's brought you presents.

297
00:28:05,486 --> 00:28:07,654
We stopped by your
house and then came looking.

298
00:28:07,739 --> 00:28:09,906
Good Lord, you are sweet.

299
00:28:10,782 --> 00:28:14,160
You're on the road actually.
We're off to Magadi to shoot some ivory.

300
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:17,288
At least I have something
good to offer you.

301
00:28:18,373 --> 00:28:21,584
Did you intend to tell
Berkeley what a fool I was?

302
00:28:21,793 --> 00:28:23,794
She had a lion a bit interested.

303
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,298
A bit? A bit,
but not enough to bite.

304
00:28:27,591 --> 00:28:29,383
It's all right to take a chance

305
00:28:30,385 --> 00:28:31,677
as long as you're
the only one who'll pay.

306
00:28:31,762 --> 00:28:32,970
Wouldn't you say so?

307
00:28:33,055 --> 00:28:35,264
I'd say that it sounds more
like something you'd say.

308
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:36,891
Thank you.
Not at all.

309
00:28:36,975 --> 00:28:38,017
Where's Blix?

310
00:28:38,101 --> 00:28:39,143
Hunting.

311
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:41,020
Has he been out long?

312
00:28:41,104 --> 00:28:42,271
Yes.

313
00:28:43,607 --> 00:28:46,359
You'll need a good chat then.
Shall we stay for supper?

314
00:28:46,443 --> 00:28:48,235
Blix will have jackets we can use.

315
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,237
Do I have anything to say in this?

316
00:28:50,364 --> 00:28:52,281
Not really, but we'll hear you out.

317
00:28:52,491 --> 00:28:54,158
Then I would like you to stay.

318
00:28:54,743 --> 00:28:55,951
Good.

319
00:28:57,788 --> 00:28:59,789
I don't know. Do you sing?

320
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:03,500
Never.

321
00:29:03,626 --> 00:29:05,126
Can you tell a story then?

322
00:29:05,795 --> 00:29:07,796
I happen to be very good at stories.

323
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:11,257
I believe that.

324
00:29:14,345 --> 00:29:16,554
What's happened
to the cows? For the dairy?

325
00:29:16,639 --> 00:29:20,141
We changed our minds.
We'll grow coffee instead.

326
00:29:20,267 --> 00:29:21,643
A bit risky, this high.

327
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:23,103
So I've been told.

328
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,521
Didn't seem to bother you.

329
00:29:24,605 --> 00:29:26,398
I think they just haven't tried.

330
00:29:27,024 --> 00:29:30,151
Every time I turn my back,
it wants to go wild again.

331
00:29:30,611 --> 00:29:32,153
It will go wild.

332
00:29:37,326 --> 00:29:38,701
Your man...

333
00:29:38,786 --> 00:29:39,828
Kanuthia.

334
00:29:40,329 --> 00:29:41,579
He's not Kikuyu?

335
00:29:41,997 --> 00:29:42,997
No.

336
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:46,918
Shall I see that he's given supper?

337
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:49,587
Don't do anything for him,
thank you, Baroness.

338
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:54,092
It's true of Somalis.
The only tribe that knows horses.

339
00:29:54,176 --> 00:29:58,387
And they don't drink, charge interest,
or chase other men's wives.

340
00:30:01,224 --> 00:30:02,766
Got to go to town for that.

341
00:30:06,729 --> 00:30:08,230
Did you know that in all of literature

342
00:30:08,314 --> 00:30:11,859
there is no poem celebrating the foot?

343
00:30:12,235 --> 00:30:16,947
There's lips, there's eyes,
hands, face, hair, breasts,

344
00:30:17,198 --> 00:30:21,535
legs, arms, even the knees, but not
one verse for the poor old foot.

345
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,873
Why do you think that is?

346
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,543
Priorities, I suppose.
Did you think you would make one?

347
00:30:30,503 --> 00:30:32,463
The problem is, there's
nothing to rhyme it with.

348
00:30:32,547 --> 00:30:33,797
Put.
It's not a noun.

349
00:30:33,882 --> 00:30:34,965
Doesn't matter.

350
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:39,219
"Along he came and he did put
upon my farm his clumsy foot"

351
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,685
We should have a story now.

352
00:30:51,982 --> 00:30:54,942
When I tell a story
to my nieces at home,

353
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:58,070
one of them always provides
the first sentence.

354
00:31:00,115 --> 00:31:01,282
Anything?

355
00:31:01,366 --> 00:31:02,783
Absolutely anything.

356
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:11,000
There was a wandering
Chinese named Cheng Huan

357
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:16,005
living in Limehouse,

358
00:31:16,423 --> 00:31:19,634
and a girl named Shirley.

359
00:31:22,304 --> 00:31:24,931
Who spoke perfect Chinese,

360
00:31:25,265 --> 00:31:28,267
which she learned
from her missionary parents.

361
00:31:29,478 --> 00:31:33,731
Cheng Huan lived alone
in a room on Formosa Street

362
00:31:33,815 --> 00:31:35,858
above the Blue Lantern.

363
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,278
He sat at his window,

364
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:45,450
and in his poor listening heart

365
00:31:46,369 --> 00:31:49,621
strange echoes
of his home and country...

366
00:32:18,317 --> 00:32:20,652
They found them
there the next morning,

367
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,988
in their room above the Blue Lantern.

368
00:32:23,489 --> 00:32:25,907
The dead child and the warlord,

369
00:32:26,826 --> 00:32:30,829
with Cheng Huan's love gift
coiled about his neck.

370
00:32:37,252 --> 00:32:39,336
Had you been to those places?

371
00:32:39,796 --> 00:32:43,132
I have been a mental traveler.

372
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:45,050
Till now.

373
00:32:45,135 --> 00:32:46,093
Yes.

374
00:32:46,177 --> 00:32:49,346
Wasn't this England?
Excuse me, Denmark?

375
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,057
I like my things.

376
00:32:52,892 --> 00:32:55,853
And when you traveled before,
in your mind,

377
00:32:56,313 --> 00:32:58,522
did you carry so much luggage?

378
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,109
A mental traveler hasn't
the need to eat or sleep

379
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:04,737
or entertain.

380
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:09,533
You're right.

381
00:33:10,076 --> 00:33:13,412
Anyway, aren't you pleased that I
brought my crystal and my china?

382
00:33:14,456 --> 00:33:16,081
And your stories, yes.

383
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,461
The conquering heroes come

384
00:33:21,296 --> 00:33:26,466
Sound the trumpets Beat the drums

385
00:33:36,644 --> 00:33:38,561
But I want you to come often.

386
00:33:39,396 --> 00:33:40,688
I'd like that very much.

387
00:33:40,773 --> 00:33:42,899
And you must promise
me it will be soon.

388
00:33:42,983 --> 00:33:44,442
I promise.

389
00:33:45,527 --> 00:33:46,819
Bye.

390
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:55,370
Did you save my life?

391
00:33:56,121 --> 00:34:00,541
No, the lioness did that.
She walked away.

392
00:34:01,168 --> 00:34:03,211
So I am not indebted then?

393
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,880
But I am.

394
00:34:07,257 --> 00:34:09,467
We pay our storytellers here.

395
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:15,264
It's lovely.

396
00:34:16,933 --> 00:34:21,812
But my stories are free and
your present's much too dear.

397
00:34:23,523 --> 00:34:25,524
Write them down sometime.

398
00:34:32,573 --> 00:34:34,533
Take care, Finch Hatton.

399
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,452
You wouldn't rather call me Denys?

400
00:34:43,793 --> 00:34:45,377
Baroness.

401
00:34:47,338 --> 00:34:48,630
Goodbye.

402
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,830
What are you doing?

403
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,126
I want you to come home.

404
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:50,107
We never spoke about children.

405
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:55,196
Did you...

406
00:35:57,365 --> 00:35:58,574
Do you?

407
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,284
Yes.

408
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:03,036
Is that all right?

409
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:24,641
These Kikuyu want to be sick now.

410
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:27,101
Good Lord!

411
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,356
Your leg has got worse.

412
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,943
You should go to hospital.

413
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:40,114
This leg may be foolish.
It may think not to go to hospital.

414
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:45,036
This leg will do as it pleases.

415
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:48,122
But if you will take it to hospital,

416
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:50,250
I will think that you are wise.

417
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:54,503
And such a wise man as this, I
would want to work in my house

418
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:56,713
for wages.

419
00:36:56,923 --> 00:37:00,175
How much wages would come
to such a wise man as that?

420
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,265
More wages than come
from tending goats.

421
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:10,269
I will speak to this leg.

422
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,227
What about air raids?

423
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:56,063
Quiet!
One question at a time.

424
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,566
The war's in Europe.
Will it ever reach here?

425
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:03,070
German East is only 200 miles south.
General Von Lettow is there.

426
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,156
Let's not wait till he
joins us at the bar.

427
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,532
Would we engage them?

428
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,869
This is our war.
You don't have to be involved, but thanks.

429
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:12,622
I've got crops coming in.
How long is this thing gonna last?

430
00:38:14,082 --> 00:38:16,584
We just have to
stay and go as we must.

431
00:38:16,668 --> 00:38:19,170
They won't fight if we won't fight.

432
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,381
We could always arm the
Masai and point them south.

433
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,050
Do you want the job
of collecting rifles

434
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:25,885
from the Masai when this is over?

435
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:29,055
And our women and children?
Shall we bring them into town?

436
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:31,933
We will deal with that
problem as it arises.

437
00:38:32,017 --> 00:38:33,559
Will they use native troops?

438
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,520
I'd assume so, but not Masai!

439
00:38:36,855 --> 00:38:38,855
Berkeley, what about your Somalis?

440
00:38:40,024 --> 00:38:43,443
They'd make very good scouts.
We can cover the area here to the border.

441
00:38:43,527 --> 00:38:46,237
We can gather information
for when the regulars arrive.

442
00:38:46,322 --> 00:38:48,865
What's it about?
Have you any idea?

443
00:38:50,451 --> 00:38:51,451
Not really.

444
00:38:51,535 --> 00:38:53,078
Then why do you want to get into it?

445
00:38:53,746 --> 00:38:55,413
It's got nothing to do with us.

446
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:58,041
They've made agreements
we know nothing about.

447
00:38:58,167 --> 00:39:01,544
Victoria and the Kaiser were
relatives, for God's sake.

448
00:39:03,047 --> 00:39:04,798
They divided Africa between them.

449
00:39:04,882 --> 00:39:06,549
Do you know why there's a border?

450
00:39:07,259 --> 00:39:09,552
'Cause she had two
mountains and he had none.

451
00:39:09,637 --> 00:39:11,763
So she gave him Kilimanjaro.

452
00:39:12,181 --> 00:39:15,100
It's a silly argument
between two spoiled countries.

453
00:39:15,643 --> 00:39:17,310
The sooner we do this,
the sooner it ends,

454
00:39:17,395 --> 00:39:19,771
the sooner we pick up
where we left off.

455
00:39:22,274 --> 00:39:23,692
It may end.

456
00:39:25,736 --> 00:39:28,238
But we're not gonna
pick up where we left off.

457
00:39:28,364 --> 00:39:32,032
You don't have to go!
You want to go!

458
00:39:32,242 --> 00:39:33,993
We've got to live here.

459
00:39:34,077 --> 00:39:35,911
They don't want you.

460
00:39:35,996 --> 00:39:37,788
They don't know where we stand.

461
00:39:37,872 --> 00:39:41,500
I'm not so fond of their empire
I'd have you shot for it.

462
00:39:41,584 --> 00:39:43,919
More likely chewed on than shot.

463
00:39:44,254 --> 00:39:47,506
The farm will take care of
itself, and you've got Belknap.

464
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:50,050
The farm will not take care of itself.

465
00:39:50,135 --> 00:39:51,927
That's not the point.

466
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:59,101
I didn't expect to like you so much.

467
00:40:04,232 --> 00:40:07,317
You're not going to go
falling in love, are you?

468
00:40:08,778 --> 00:40:11,405
Not with someone who's always leaving.

469
00:40:14,951 --> 00:40:18,620
If you need me, send a
runner to find Delamere.

470
00:40:18,955 --> 00:40:20,748
That's where I'll be.

471
00:40:27,004 --> 00:40:28,629
That's a fine kiss goodbye.

472
00:40:28,756 --> 00:40:30,548
I'm better at hello.

473
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,525
It's an odd feeling, farewell.

474
00:40:50,986 --> 00:40:53,279
There is some envy in it.

475
00:40:54,406 --> 00:40:58,326
Men go off to be tested for courage.

476
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:02,497
But if we're tested
at all it's for patience,

477
00:41:02,581 --> 00:41:04,373
for doing without,

478
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:08,836
perhaps for how well
we can endure loneliness.

479
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:11,964
But I had always known that.

480
00:41:14,802 --> 00:41:16,718
It didn't require a war.

481
00:41:17,845 --> 00:41:20,222
I said goodbye to Bror.

482
00:41:20,848 --> 00:41:25,602
Denys left without a word,
which was quite proper.

483
00:41:28,856 --> 00:41:30,440
Hello, the house!

484
00:41:34,862 --> 00:41:37,364
I thought you might want some meat.

485
00:41:38,407 --> 00:41:40,075
Is there any word?

486
00:41:40,201 --> 00:41:42,119
Nothing new.

487
00:41:42,203 --> 00:41:44,579
There's not much fighting.
Awful fever, though.

488
00:41:46,374 --> 00:41:49,042
I've got time for tea, I should think.

489
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,301
Are you for the Germans?

490
00:42:01,556 --> 00:42:03,974
Did they send you out to ask me this?

491
00:42:04,058 --> 00:42:05,892
We had a row about it in town.

492
00:42:05,977 --> 00:42:07,769
Because of my bad English.

493
00:42:09,437 --> 00:42:11,564
And whose side were you on?

494
00:42:12,232 --> 00:42:13,399
Yours.

495
00:42:18,905 --> 00:42:20,614
They want to send me home to school.

496
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:22,491
Mother says I'm growing up wild.

497
00:42:22,742 --> 00:42:24,243
I wanted to ask you about it.

498
00:42:24,327 --> 00:42:25,369
Me?

499
00:42:26,496 --> 00:42:28,747
You've been around and about.

500
00:42:29,666 --> 00:42:33,085
Some day, I'd like to run
my own show the way you do.

501
00:42:34,921 --> 00:42:36,547
Is that what I do?

502
00:42:36,673 --> 00:42:38,257
You don't seem to need us much.

503
00:42:41,761 --> 00:42:43,762
May I ask you something?

504
00:42:45,932 --> 00:42:48,851
I don't know much about men.

505
00:42:52,272 --> 00:42:54,773
I want them to like me, but I...

506
00:42:55,942 --> 00:42:58,319
I want to be let alone, too.

507
00:43:02,573 --> 00:43:05,491
I'm supposed to want
to be taken, aren't I?

508
00:43:08,245 --> 00:43:10,038
I've got this book,

509
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:15,543
but how do you know when to
do what they want you to

510
00:43:15,628 --> 00:43:18,296
and when not to?

511
00:43:23,344 --> 00:43:25,929
I suppose you ought to call me Karen.

512
00:43:41,946 --> 00:43:45,406
They need paraffin and tinned food.
Enough for 300 men.

513
00:43:45,491 --> 00:43:48,076
He wants you to send
a white man with the wagon.

514
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,661
Is he all right?

515
00:43:49,745 --> 00:43:52,455
I assume. Well enough
to send a message.

516
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:55,540
And where would my husband
like this wagon sent?

517
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:58,252
He's with Delamere on the
border near Lake Natron.

518
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:00,045
That's confidential, of course.

519
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:01,880
I would bear that in mind.

520
00:44:01,965 --> 00:44:03,715
Sorry, I only meant

521
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,468
it wouldn't do for it to
be talk around Nairobi.

522
00:44:06,552 --> 00:44:08,428
We have to move you into town.

523
00:44:08,513 --> 00:44:10,138
We can't protect you here.

524
00:44:11,224 --> 00:44:12,891
What do you mean, into town?

525
00:44:12,976 --> 00:44:15,394
With the men gone, we're
worried about the natives.

526
00:44:15,478 --> 00:44:17,938
We have orders.
Women and children into town.

527
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:20,274
That is internment, Lieutenant.

528
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:22,025
Women and children.

529
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:25,696
Is that one category or two?

530
00:44:25,905 --> 00:44:28,073
You'll want time
to gather your things.

531
00:44:28,157 --> 00:44:30,409
I'll send an escort
here for you Thursday.

532
00:44:30,493 --> 00:44:32,244
And I am a captain.

533
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:39,501
I'm not paid to fight.

534
00:44:41,587 --> 00:44:42,754
No.

535
00:44:45,591 --> 00:44:47,383
Where is Lake Natron?

536
00:44:47,676 --> 00:44:49,719
That's south.
Bush country.

537
00:44:50,762 --> 00:44:52,471
It's no place for a white man.

538
00:47:35,883 --> 00:47:38,718
We should have crossed
the Sand River today.

539
00:47:39,595 --> 00:47:41,554
I may have got us lost.

540
00:47:42,139 --> 00:47:43,598
God is great.

541
00:48:38,152 --> 00:48:39,945
What the devil are you doing here?

542
00:48:40,112 --> 00:48:41,905
I'm on my way to Delamere.

543
00:48:41,989 --> 00:48:43,865
Ridiculous.
We don't send women to war.

544
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:45,242
Well, I'm going.

545
00:48:45,326 --> 00:48:48,286
We haven't time for this.
You don't know where you are.

546
00:48:48,371 --> 00:48:49,371
I do now.

547
00:48:49,455 --> 00:48:50,830
And you'll just get lost again.

548
00:48:51,874 --> 00:48:53,333
I'm going on.

549
00:48:54,126 --> 00:48:55,877
Talk to her, will you?

550
00:48:56,003 --> 00:48:57,045
No.

551
00:48:58,506 --> 00:49:00,590
She could be hurt or worse.

552
00:49:00,675 --> 00:49:02,300
I imagine she knows that.

553
00:49:03,469 --> 00:49:05,011
Right, I tried.

554
00:49:11,142 --> 00:49:12,393
Here.

555
00:49:14,312 --> 00:49:17,815
Find a spot on the horizon
each morning and steer by it.

556
00:49:18,024 --> 00:49:19,650
South-southwest.

557
00:49:20,151 --> 00:49:21,819
About three days.

558
00:49:22,404 --> 00:49:23,487
I see.

559
00:49:24,489 --> 00:49:27,491
And don't worry about us,
we'll be all right.

560
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:20,835
What is it?

561
00:50:20,919 --> 00:50:22,003
Masai.

562
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:11,527
Ismail, my rifle, where's my rifle?

563
00:52:39,513 --> 00:52:40,805
Get away!

564
00:53:42,033 --> 00:53:45,536
Msabu's bleeding.
She does not have this ox.

565
00:53:47,455 --> 00:53:49,456
This lion is hungry.

566
00:53:50,333 --> 00:53:52,584
He does not have this ox.

567
00:53:54,212 --> 00:53:58,340
This wagon is heavy.
It doesn't have this ox.

568
00:54:00,176 --> 00:54:03,887
God is happy.
He plays with us.

569
00:54:15,316 --> 00:54:17,276
Tell Blix his wife's here.

570
00:55:01,403 --> 00:55:02,612
Hello, Karen.

571
00:55:03,572 --> 00:55:06,240
Hello, D. Hello, Bror.

572
00:55:07,075 --> 00:55:09,285
I've brought you some things.

573
00:55:10,913 --> 00:55:12,914
You've changed your hair.

574
00:55:15,249 --> 00:55:16,666
You needed supplies...

575
00:55:16,751 --> 00:55:18,126
Send someone, I said.

576
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:21,546
You were lucky to get through.
It was really foolish.

577
00:55:21,631 --> 00:55:23,506
But I did get through.

578
00:55:25,092 --> 00:55:26,635
And it was fun.

579
00:55:32,141 --> 00:55:34,142
When are you coming home?

580
00:55:37,355 --> 00:55:38,772
Not just yet.

581
00:55:40,942 --> 00:55:44,402
You're not going to help at
all with the farm, are you?

582
00:55:46,739 --> 00:55:47,948
No.

583
00:55:48,407 --> 00:55:51,910
I could force you.
I could cut you off.

584
00:55:53,329 --> 00:55:55,580
I'll just hunt professionally.

585
00:55:57,458 --> 00:55:59,250
I might do it anyway.

586
00:56:03,673 --> 00:56:06,466
It's not the way
we thought it would be,

587
00:56:08,593 --> 00:56:09,843
is it?

588
00:56:17,811 --> 00:56:20,604
But I like it that
you're honest with me.

589
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:23,315
I like you, too.

590
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:33,283
Very much.

591
00:57:11,739 --> 00:57:14,115
I had a compass from Denys.

592
00:57:14,783 --> 00:57:16,784
"To steer by," he said.

593
00:57:17,703 --> 00:57:19,871
But later it came to me

594
00:57:19,955 --> 00:57:22,915
that we navigated differently.

595
00:57:25,085 --> 00:57:29,130
Perhaps he knew, as I did not,

596
00:57:30,215 --> 00:57:32,550
that the Earth was made round

597
00:57:32,885 --> 00:57:36,596
so that we would not see
too far down the road.

598
00:58:08,252 --> 00:58:10,003
You've got syphilis.

599
00:58:15,843 --> 00:58:17,636
That's not possible.

600
00:58:19,847 --> 00:58:21,848
Your husband is not ill?

601
00:58:26,521 --> 00:58:27,521
No.

602
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,982
Not the last time I saw him.

603
00:58:32,235 --> 00:58:34,361
That was three months ago.

604
00:58:37,907 --> 00:58:39,574
He's on the border with Delamere.

605
00:58:39,659 --> 00:58:41,201
He would have come home.

606
00:58:41,369 --> 00:58:43,036
These cases vary.

607
00:58:44,412 --> 00:58:46,413
He may have just a touch.

608
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:50,084
But you are very ill.

609
00:58:59,261 --> 00:59:01,387
Is he the only possibility?

610
00:59:04,391 --> 00:59:05,474
Yes.

611
00:59:06,268 --> 00:59:09,395
You'll have to go home
to deal with it, you know?

612
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:13,774
The treatment's difficult, but they
have a thing called Salvarsan.

613
00:59:14,568 --> 00:59:15,734
Arsenic.

614
00:59:18,738 --> 00:59:24,577
And if I'm not cured then I
will be insane, won't I?

615
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:26,453
You ought to go soon.

616
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:30,416
I'll have to see your husband.

617
00:59:34,754 --> 00:59:36,297
I will send for him.

618
00:59:36,423 --> 00:59:39,841
These ought to help with the
fever till you get home.

619
00:59:48,434 --> 00:59:50,268
And what are my chances?

620
00:59:50,936 --> 00:59:52,854
About even, I'm afraid.

621
01:00:03,616 --> 01:00:06,492
It's not what I thought
would happen to me now.

622
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,927
Muthaiga?

623
01:00:24,553 --> 01:00:27,138
What?
Your letters.

624
01:00:36,522 --> 01:00:37,648
Excuse me.

625
01:00:40,276 --> 01:00:44,279
I heard you had made it.
I'd have paid anything to see their faces.

626
01:00:44,781 --> 01:00:46,657
Hello.

627
01:00:47,533 --> 01:00:48,909
Would you join us for a drink?

628
01:00:48,993 --> 01:00:51,662
I can't. How is it that you are home?

629
01:00:51,913 --> 01:00:53,830
I brought Berkeley back.

630
01:00:54,415 --> 01:00:55,415
Has he been wounded?

631
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,500
No, fever.

632
01:00:56,793 --> 01:00:58,085
More than usual,
but he'll be all right

633
01:00:58,169 --> 01:00:59,836
as long as the gin holds out.

634
01:01:01,172 --> 01:01:04,341
And you?
How is it with the fighting?

635
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:09,846
We're taking a beating.
It's likely to last for a while.

636
01:01:13,184 --> 01:01:14,768
I still have your compass.

637
01:01:15,019 --> 01:01:16,645
Why don't you keep it?

638
01:01:18,022 --> 01:01:19,648
You've earned it.

639
01:01:20,483 --> 01:01:24,193
Besides, I don't always want to
know where I'm going anyway.

640
01:01:29,533 --> 01:01:31,784
Please don't let me keep you.

641
01:01:35,372 --> 01:01:36,580
Are you all right?

642
01:01:36,832 --> 01:01:37,915
Yes.

643
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:39,917
Take good care.

644
01:01:41,753 --> 01:01:43,004
We're behind a story or two.

645
01:01:43,255 --> 01:01:45,464
Yes. When I get back.

646
01:01:45,549 --> 01:01:46,716
Back? From where?

647
01:01:47,342 --> 01:01:49,427
When you get back, I meant.

648
01:01:51,763 --> 01:01:54,473
I thought it was malaria.
It wasn't.

649
01:01:57,352 --> 01:02:00,563
And you may be all right,
but you have to be seen.

650
01:02:02,399 --> 01:02:06,527
And the others, whoever they
are, I hope they've got it.

651
01:02:07,946 --> 01:02:11,615
It's my fault, no one else's.

652
01:02:16,912 --> 01:02:18,788
I want to go with you.

653
01:02:19,415 --> 01:02:21,750
Someone has to stay here
and run things,

654
01:02:21,834 --> 01:02:24,002
and the factory must be finished.

655
01:02:26,297 --> 01:02:27,297
Can you do that?

656
01:02:27,381 --> 01:02:28,673
That's little enough.

657
01:02:44,065 --> 01:02:45,398
I'm sorry.

658
01:02:52,823 --> 01:02:54,032
I'm sorry.

659
01:03:02,333 --> 01:03:03,958
Where's memsahib?

660
01:03:04,585 --> 01:03:06,585
She can come soon enough.

661
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:18,639
Later that day, I left for Mombasa

662
01:03:19,307 --> 01:03:22,267
and the voyage home to Denmark.

663
01:03:24,187 --> 01:03:26,647
It was a longer journey this time.

664
01:03:27,982 --> 01:03:30,150
The war went on.

665
01:03:30,652 --> 01:03:32,861
I fought my own war.

666
01:03:33,988 --> 01:03:38,534
Arsenic was my ally
against an enemy I never saw.

667
01:03:42,414 --> 01:03:45,624
I stayed in the room where I was born

668
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:47,876
in Rungstedlund

669
01:03:48,002 --> 01:03:51,338
and tried to remember
the colors of Africa.

670
01:04:04,017 --> 01:04:06,185
There was only the medicine

671
01:04:06,854 --> 01:04:11,357
and walks with my mother along
a deserted stretch of beach

672
01:04:12,025 --> 01:04:15,611
and this room in my mother's house.

673
01:04:18,532 --> 01:04:21,701
Denmark had become a stranger to me

674
01:04:22,286 --> 01:04:23,786
and I to her.

675
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,915
But my mother's house,
I came to know again.

676
01:04:29,418 --> 01:04:34,213
And knew I would come
back to it, sick or well,

677
01:04:35,048 --> 01:04:37,425
sane or mad, someday.

678
01:04:38,969 --> 01:04:40,845
And so I did,

679
01:04:41,638 --> 01:04:43,055
after Tsavo.

680
01:05:35,608 --> 01:05:37,901
Almost everyone's got them now.

681
01:06:51,473 --> 01:06:53,057
I am cooking now.

682
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:54,976
I have heard about this.

683
01:07:07,239 --> 01:07:08,698
Are you well?

684
01:07:10,451 --> 01:07:12,493
I am well enough.

685
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:15,204
Then I am well enough also.

686
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:19,626
What will you do?

687
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:23,087
I have been thinking I'll hunt.
Safari sort of thing.

688
01:07:23,547 --> 01:07:27,091
They say it'll be quite a
business once the war is over.

689
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:30,093
You wouldn't want to teach?

690
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:33,889
I would like these Kikuyu
to have a school.

691
01:07:35,308 --> 01:07:37,726
There will be a fight about that.

692
01:07:44,567 --> 01:07:46,985
Are you all well?

693
01:07:47,403 --> 01:07:49,196
They say I'm cured.

694
01:07:51,991 --> 01:07:53,867
I won't have children.

695
01:08:02,502 --> 01:08:04,544
Have you thought about us?

696
01:08:08,257 --> 01:08:09,257
Of course.

697
01:08:20,269 --> 01:08:24,188
Belknap says the coffee will
flower after the next rains.

698
01:08:25,607 --> 01:08:30,027
If it does, you'll have to start
thinking about hiring for the harvest

699
01:08:30,112 --> 01:08:32,780
and how you'll get to market.

700
01:09:46,353 --> 01:09:47,937
Where would Berkeley be?

701
01:09:48,022 --> 01:09:49,397
He must be here.

702
01:10:00,701 --> 01:10:02,494
Who won the match?

703
01:10:11,169 --> 01:10:13,253
Have you got a story for me?

704
01:10:14,881 --> 01:10:16,381
Finch Hatton.

705
01:10:17,759 --> 01:10:20,552
I've been demoted.
I was Denys last time.

706
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,222
Would you care for some champagne?

707
01:10:25,225 --> 01:10:26,892
They said you went home for a while.

708
01:10:28,019 --> 01:10:29,102
Yes.

709
01:10:29,604 --> 01:10:30,979
Where's Berkeley?

710
01:10:31,064 --> 01:10:32,397
It's good to see you.

711
01:10:36,861 --> 01:10:40,739
He's still down with fever. He'll be all right.
Who are all these people?

712
01:10:42,408 --> 01:10:44,868
Bror says we'll be a colony soon.

713
01:10:46,538 --> 01:10:48,539
They want it settled now.

714
01:10:49,123 --> 01:10:52,793
They've got a lottery.
"Buy a ticket, win a farm in Africa."

715
01:10:52,919 --> 01:10:55,671
Did you really think it
would stay the way it was?

716
01:10:57,881 --> 01:10:59,590
I thought it might.

717
01:11:02,094 --> 01:11:03,344
Where is Kanuthia?

718
01:11:03,846 --> 01:11:05,096
He's dead.

719
01:11:11,979 --> 01:11:14,939
How are you?
Would you join us for a drink?

720
01:11:17,067 --> 01:11:18,985
It's time to find a pillow.

721
01:11:19,945 --> 01:11:21,320
Another night then?

722
01:11:26,118 --> 01:11:27,952
Have a good Christmas.

723
01:11:29,246 --> 01:11:30,663
Christmas?

724
01:11:31,957 --> 01:11:33,207
So it is.

725
01:12:04,655 --> 01:12:07,657
This Chief says
children higher than this

726
01:12:07,825 --> 01:12:09,868
must not learn to read.

727
01:12:11,913 --> 01:12:14,581
Tell him that all the
children must go to school.

728
01:12:14,665 --> 01:12:19,002
No, this is a Chief.
You are not a Chief.

729
01:12:19,337 --> 01:12:20,420
That's absurd.

730
01:12:20,504 --> 01:12:24,174
It is not good for tall people
to know more than this Chief.

731
01:12:24,508 --> 01:12:28,845
When these children are tall,
then this Chief can be dead.

732
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:08,425
Bror, yes. But Denys hired out
to tourists, I can't imagine.

733
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:10,886
He's got no other trade
and we've got no choice.

734
01:13:10,971 --> 01:13:13,055
The government's
put a stop to the ivory.

735
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:14,807
What will you do then?

736
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:16,558
I'll concentrate on the farm.

737
01:13:16,643 --> 01:13:18,227
Hello, the house!

738
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:21,355
How is it you're home?

739
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:25,901
I'm out. Look. I didn't learn a
thing, but I'm wonderfully clean.

740
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:30,906
I'll come and see you.
You save me a dance, Berkeley.

741
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,958
What's this nonsense
I hear about a school?

742
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:43,876
I've taken on a young missionary.

743
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:47,547
He's promised me to do the alphabet
first, and save God for later.

744
01:13:47,631 --> 01:13:50,049
Wogs can't even count their goats.

745
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:52,552
It's none of your
bloody business anyway!

746
01:13:52,636 --> 01:13:54,470
Who the devil are you?

747
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:02,520
I wonder if you'd dance with me?

748
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:06,941
I think you are about to apologize.

749
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:12,321
You do stir things up.

750
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:17,952
When they said they'd like to read,

751
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:19,579
how did they put that exactly?

752
01:14:19,663 --> 01:14:21,456
Do they know they'd like Dickens?

753
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,458
You don't think they
should learn to read?

754
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:25,501
I think you might have asked them.

755
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:27,878
Did you ask to learn
when you were a child?

756
01:14:27,962 --> 01:14:30,255
How can stories possibly harm them?

757
01:14:30,339 --> 01:14:32,841
They have their own stories,
just not in writing.

758
01:14:32,967 --> 01:14:35,510
Why would you rather
keep them ignorant?

759
01:14:35,595 --> 01:14:37,387
They're not ignorant.

760
01:14:37,597 --> 01:14:41,099
I just don't think they should be
turned into little Englishmen.

761
01:14:46,856 --> 01:14:48,565
You do like to change
things, don't you?

762
01:14:48,649 --> 01:14:50,650
For the better, I hope.

763
01:14:51,611 --> 01:14:54,029
I want my Kikuyu to learn to read.

764
01:14:54,947 --> 01:14:58,450
My Kikuyu.
My Limoges. My farm.

765
01:14:58,534 --> 01:15:00,035
It's an awful lot to own, isn't it?

766
01:15:00,119 --> 01:15:02,120
I've paid a price for all I own.

767
01:15:02,205 --> 01:15:04,539
What is it exactly that's yours?

768
01:15:06,084 --> 01:15:09,294
We're not owners here,
we're just passing through.

769
01:15:11,214 --> 01:15:13,840
Is life really so damn simple for you?

770
01:15:15,218 --> 01:15:17,803
Perhaps I ask less of it than you do.

771
01:15:18,638 --> 01:15:20,304
I don't believe that at all.

772
01:15:20,388 --> 01:15:22,014
Happy New Year!

773
01:16:41,719 --> 01:16:43,720
Happy New Year.

774
01:16:44,638 --> 01:16:46,556
And for you, too.

775
01:17:05,742 --> 01:17:08,744
Someone has left her
underclothes in the back.

776
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,462
I want you to take a place in town.

777
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:26,136
Are you sure?

778
01:17:48,993 --> 01:17:50,160
Eats.

779
01:17:55,833 --> 01:17:57,750
He eats.

780
01:17:58,001 --> 01:17:59,085
Elephant.

781
01:18:27,197 --> 01:18:28,656
Give me work.

782
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:14,409
We've got peace,
where is the prosperity?

783
01:19:14,744 --> 01:19:16,494
Why should the prices fall now

784
01:19:16,579 --> 01:19:18,288
just because they're
not killing anybody?

785
01:19:19,081 --> 01:19:20,957
Tea's down just as bad.

786
01:19:24,253 --> 01:19:26,588
Do they always have to whip them so?

787
01:19:55,825 --> 01:19:59,453
They finally made a machine
that's really useful. Listen.

788
01:20:04,167 --> 01:20:05,626
It's for you.

789
01:20:07,128 --> 01:20:08,504
I can't accept it.

790
01:20:09,339 --> 01:20:10,339
Why not?

791
01:20:10,423 --> 01:20:12,049
Bror's moved to town.

792
01:20:13,927 --> 01:20:15,636
That's a private matter, I imagine.

793
01:20:25,814 --> 01:20:27,940
Did you think you would
spend the night?

794
01:20:28,024 --> 01:20:31,318
Can't, thanks.
I have to go down to the Mara.

795
01:20:34,072 --> 01:20:37,407
I've taken up safari work
and I've gotta find a camp.

796
01:20:41,245 --> 01:20:42,328
No.

797
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:46,833
There's country there you ought to see.
It won't last long now.

798
01:20:48,544 --> 01:20:50,711
I would be wasting your time.

799
01:20:51,672 --> 01:20:53,589
Why don't you get your things?

800
01:20:56,385 --> 01:20:58,386
If you like me at all,

801
01:20:59,555 --> 01:21:01,222
don't ask me to do this.

802
01:22:22,427 --> 01:22:24,094
What's your word?

803
01:22:26,181 --> 01:22:27,348
Shoo?

804
01:22:29,601 --> 01:22:31,268
Is that it? Shoo?

805
01:22:42,030 --> 01:22:44,573
That's a fine word you've got there.

806
01:22:54,292 --> 01:22:55,751
Crank it again, please.

807
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:59,004
Almost. Crank it again.

808
01:23:07,806 --> 01:23:09,139
Once more.

809
01:23:15,604 --> 01:23:17,355
Well done. We're off.

810
01:23:24,822 --> 01:23:26,739
I don't know
the scientific basis for it,

811
01:23:26,824 --> 01:23:28,700
but I know you can see further

812
01:23:28,784 --> 01:23:31,786
in the African night
than any other place.

813
01:23:34,498 --> 01:23:36,541
And the stars are brighter.

814
01:23:41,213 --> 01:23:43,047
It's about the tents.

815
01:23:43,716 --> 01:23:45,967
When I'm out with Kanuthia...

816
01:23:47,344 --> 01:23:50,138
Used to be, we didn't use them.

817
01:23:51,557 --> 01:23:53,641
I remember him.

818
01:23:55,185 --> 01:23:56,477
There was something...

819
01:23:56,645 --> 01:23:57,729
Masai.

820
01:23:58,856 --> 01:24:01,149
He was half Masai, that's
what you remember about him.

821
01:24:02,484 --> 01:24:04,484
They're like nobody else.

822
01:24:05,570 --> 01:24:09,239
We think we'll tame them,
but we won't.

823
01:24:10,867 --> 01:24:12,784
If you put them in prison, they die.

824
01:24:13,911 --> 01:24:15,120
Why?

825
01:24:15,204 --> 01:24:19,041
Because they live now.
They don't think about the future.

826
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:24,379
They can't grasp the idea that
they'll be let out one day.

827
01:24:24,881 --> 01:24:28,383
They think it's permanent,
so they die.

828
01:24:31,554 --> 01:24:34,348
They're the only ones here
that don't care about us,

829
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:36,850
and that is what will finish them.

830
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:42,397
What did the two of you
ever find to talk about?

831
01:24:44,609 --> 01:24:45,817
Nothing.

832
01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:55,243
So you knew I would come.

833
01:25:02,167 --> 01:25:05,795
It's an early day tomorrow.
Why don't you get some sleep?

834
01:25:08,173 --> 01:25:09,590
What happens tomorrow?

835
01:25:09,925 --> 01:25:11,217
I have no idea.

836
01:25:17,015 --> 01:25:18,516
Good night.

837
01:25:58,681 --> 01:26:00,390
You would think they would run off.

838
01:26:01,392 --> 01:26:02,809
You didn't.

839
01:26:32,298 --> 01:26:36,259
Think of that.
Never a man-made sound, and then Mozart.

840
01:27:09,459 --> 01:27:10,959
Have you clients already?

841
01:27:11,044 --> 01:27:14,171
In a week. A man from
Belgium and his daughters.

842
01:27:14,714 --> 01:27:17,758
His letter said, "We'd
like three of everything."

843
01:27:17,842 --> 01:27:19,676
It'll be an interesting trip.

844
01:27:19,761 --> 01:27:22,846
I'll be gone a month,
or an hour and a half.

845
01:27:24,432 --> 01:27:26,433
Why are you doing this?

846
01:27:27,268 --> 01:27:29,102
I don't know how to sow.

847
01:27:46,745 --> 01:27:49,497
Do you know what they're
made of? Cloth.

848
01:27:49,998 --> 01:27:52,583
Where will he land?
Trick is not to.

849
01:27:57,548 --> 01:27:59,382
It must feel amazing.

850
01:28:04,304 --> 01:28:07,265
It's how I imagined America to be.

851
01:28:08,267 --> 01:28:09,642
Have you been to America?

852
01:28:09,726 --> 01:28:11,686
No, but my father was there,

853
01:28:11,770 --> 01:28:15,940
and he always told me stories about
it when I was a little girl.

854
01:28:16,942 --> 01:28:18,317
Are you still close?

855
01:28:18,402 --> 01:28:22,363
He died. He killed himself
when I was 10 years old.

856
01:28:46,304 --> 01:28:47,804
I can fix that, I think.

857
01:28:48,014 --> 01:28:51,391
"Laugh'd loud and long,
and all the while

858
01:28:51,767 --> 01:28:53,977
"His eyes went to and fro

859
01:28:54,854 --> 01:28:58,690
"quoth he, 'full plain I see

860
01:28:59,525 --> 01:29:02,110
"'The Devil knows how to row'

861
01:29:04,071 --> 01:29:05,739
"Farewell, farewell!"

862
01:29:05,823 --> 01:29:07,073
You're skipping verses.

863
01:29:07,158 --> 01:29:08,825
I leave out the dull parts.

864
01:29:09,619 --> 01:29:14,581
"Farewell, farewell!
But this I tell To thee, thou Wedding-Guest!"

865
01:29:14,665 --> 01:29:16,166
Lay your head back.

866
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:21,045
"He prayeth well, who loveth well

867
01:29:21,588 --> 01:29:25,466
"Both man and bird and beast"

868
01:29:36,478 --> 01:29:37,811
That's better.

869
01:29:39,648 --> 01:29:41,774
Will it be so different,

870
01:29:42,192 --> 01:29:44,026
hunting for hire?

871
01:29:44,194 --> 01:29:47,696
Not for the animals.
Well, maybe for the animals.

872
01:29:48,657 --> 01:29:51,325
Do you really prefer them to people?

873
01:29:51,409 --> 01:29:52,534
Sometimes.

874
01:29:53,370 --> 01:29:55,704
They don't do anything
half-heartedly.

875
01:29:55,830 --> 01:29:58,040
Everything's for the first time.

876
01:29:58,166 --> 01:30:00,542
Hunting, working, mating.

877
01:30:02,128 --> 01:30:03,796
It's only man that does it badly.

878
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:06,173
It's only man that tires
of going through it.

879
01:30:07,842 --> 01:30:12,095
Who says, "See here.
I know how you feel about me

880
01:30:12,179 --> 01:30:14,806
"and you know how I feel about you.

881
01:30:16,558 --> 01:30:21,396
"We understand each other, so let's
lie down and get on with it."

882
01:30:30,406 --> 01:30:31,906
Why am I here?

883
01:30:34,994 --> 01:30:37,578
Because I wanted you to see all this.

884
01:30:40,541 --> 01:30:42,583
I wanted to show it to you.

885
01:30:43,669 --> 01:30:45,503
I thought you'd understand it.

886
01:30:50,759 --> 01:30:52,510
Do you think much about death?

887
01:30:53,262 --> 01:30:55,096
I think about getting old.

888
01:30:57,516 --> 01:31:01,060
It'd be like living with a
cranky demanding old bastard.

889
01:31:02,271 --> 01:31:05,439
You are a cranky
demanding old bastard.

890
01:31:12,739 --> 01:31:14,281
I had syphilis.

891
01:31:20,830 --> 01:31:22,748
That's why I went home.

892
01:31:26,002 --> 01:31:27,252
I know.

893
01:31:30,089 --> 01:31:34,009
I never seem to get anything.
German measles once.

894
01:31:38,598 --> 01:31:41,308
They say I'll have a normal life now.

895
01:31:43,019 --> 01:31:44,644
But no children.

896
01:31:47,482 --> 01:31:49,024
So the school.

897
01:31:53,279 --> 01:31:54,780
So the school.

898
01:31:56,323 --> 01:31:58,824
The farm, that's what I am now.

899
01:32:00,577 --> 01:32:01,619
No.

900
01:32:11,671 --> 01:32:14,340
We'll need meat for the camp tomorrow.

901
01:32:15,842 --> 01:32:17,593
I'll wake you at dawn.

902
01:32:25,018 --> 01:32:26,352
Good night.

903
01:32:40,951 --> 01:32:43,119
We might scare up a gazelle or two.

904
01:32:43,370 --> 01:32:45,621
But we'll be going through
buffalo country again.

905
01:32:45,705 --> 01:32:48,039
They get cocky when you're on foot.

906
01:34:08,536 --> 01:34:11,496
Supper. Good size, but...

907
01:34:22,550 --> 01:34:23,675
Lion.

908
01:34:26,179 --> 01:34:28,430
Careful, the wind's behind us.

909
01:35:29,615 --> 01:35:31,741
Back up. Slowly.

910
01:35:46,424 --> 01:35:50,510
If there's a charge, drop
flat, and let me do it.

911
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:20,080
Drop!

912
01:36:34,095 --> 01:36:35,471
Reload now!

913
01:37:13,634 --> 01:37:15,301
Dinner in a while?

914
01:37:18,263 --> 01:37:19,931
I'm glad you came.

915
01:38:49,562 --> 01:38:51,438
To rose-lipt maidens.

916
01:39:00,363 --> 01:39:03,199
There was a very
young girl from Denmark

917
01:39:04,451 --> 01:39:07,786
who took passage on a
steamer bound for Suez.

918
01:39:10,749 --> 01:39:12,541
There was a storm

919
01:39:14,044 --> 01:39:15,628
off Morocco

920
01:39:18,798 --> 01:39:22,927
and she was washed
ashore onto a beach.

921
01:39:28,934 --> 01:39:30,684
Onto a white beach.

922
01:39:40,362 --> 01:39:42,780
Onto a beach so white...

923
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:26,573
I'd like to do that.

924
01:40:38,127 --> 01:40:39,668
Will that hurt?

925
01:40:49,721 --> 01:40:51,680
If you say anything now,

926
01:40:52,932 --> 01:40:54,308
I'll believe it.

927
01:41:18,791 --> 01:41:21,460
I need to know
how to think about this.

928
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:24,963
Why?

929
01:42:02,918 --> 01:42:05,961
Clear soup, the new lettuce,

930
01:42:06,088 --> 01:42:08,339
chicken, just the breast.

931
01:42:10,967 --> 01:42:13,177
I trust this meets with your approval.

932
01:42:13,261 --> 01:42:14,970
Who is coming?

933
01:42:15,055 --> 01:42:16,138
Bwana Cole is coming.

934
01:42:16,223 --> 01:42:18,307
I will think on Bwana Cole.

935
01:42:28,442 --> 01:42:30,985
I've got myself in real trouble now.

936
01:42:31,112 --> 01:42:32,487
Now you think they should vote?

937
01:42:32,571 --> 01:42:33,655
No, worse.

938
01:42:36,283 --> 01:42:37,450
Denys?

939
01:42:50,089 --> 01:42:51,464
Get Kamante.

940
01:42:53,467 --> 01:42:55,552
He is out of hand entirely.

941
01:43:03,978 --> 01:43:06,187
Does this look like a chicken?

942
01:43:08,107 --> 01:43:11,693
Here is not a chicken, here is a fish.

943
01:43:14,155 --> 01:43:15,447
Go away.

944
01:43:21,745 --> 01:43:22,870
What do you think?

945
01:43:24,205 --> 01:43:26,623
Well, I think it's
quite good, isn't it?

946
01:43:29,002 --> 01:43:30,335
Be careful.

947
01:43:34,090 --> 01:43:36,425
When the old mapmakers
got to the edge of the world,

948
01:43:36,509 --> 01:43:40,345
they used to write, "'Beyond
this place, there be dragons."

949
01:43:41,097 --> 01:43:42,848
Is that where I am?

950
01:43:45,351 --> 01:43:47,644
He likes to give presents,

951
01:43:48,521 --> 01:43:50,230
but not at Christmas.

952
01:43:52,025 --> 01:43:54,860
He hasn't even said
when he's coming again.

953
01:43:55,570 --> 01:43:57,362
If he's coming again.

954
01:43:59,616 --> 01:44:01,283
Would you divorce?

955
01:44:02,368 --> 01:44:04,369
Then I would have no one.

956
01:45:19,735 --> 01:45:23,405
Men who missed moose in
Alaska, grizzly in America,

957
01:45:23,489 --> 01:45:27,075
tigers in India, they're all
at sea now bound for here.

958
01:45:29,245 --> 01:45:32,914
Berkeley is going to farm.
You could do that.

959
01:45:34,125 --> 01:45:35,625
No, thank you.

960
01:45:37,587 --> 01:45:41,590
You ought to look in on him though.
He didn't look all that well.

961
01:45:50,141 --> 01:45:51,641
Can you stay?

962
01:45:56,146 --> 01:45:57,730
For a day or so.

963
01:45:59,482 --> 01:46:00,524
Is that all right?

964
01:46:00,609 --> 01:46:01,734
No.

965
01:46:05,322 --> 01:46:07,489
You don't need two guns on safari.

966
01:46:07,824 --> 01:46:11,577
Then do the town work.
Meet the clients, do outfitting.

967
01:46:11,661 --> 01:46:13,495
There's the mail.
Lots of mail.

968
01:46:13,580 --> 01:46:15,664
I don't know if I'd be right for that.

969
01:46:16,333 --> 01:46:18,375
You've gotta do something.

970
01:46:19,169 --> 01:46:23,088
I don't actually.
My water's gone black.

971
01:46:29,721 --> 01:46:33,432
We've gotta get you to a hospital,
and get you some proper care.

972
01:46:35,727 --> 01:46:37,937
I'm being cared for properly.

973
01:46:52,826 --> 01:46:54,577
It's some years now.

974
01:46:55,996 --> 01:46:58,039
She's fond of me, I think.

975
01:47:02,252 --> 01:47:04,212
Why didn't you tell me?

976
01:47:04,755 --> 01:47:07,924
I suppose I thought...

977
01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:13,429
I didn't know you well enough.

978
01:47:18,227 --> 01:47:19,852
There's money left
in the trading account.

979
01:47:19,937 --> 01:47:23,147
I'd like my share to go to Mariammo.

980
01:47:23,232 --> 01:47:24,857
Berkeley, listen.

981
01:47:25,442 --> 01:47:29,362
George Martin had blackwater fever
and that was five years now.

982
01:47:30,072 --> 01:47:32,824
You might take along that
twelve-bore you're so fond of.

983
01:47:32,908 --> 01:47:34,951
The trigger seems a bit...

984
01:47:35,744 --> 01:47:39,579
And the Rigby, get Karen to try the Rigby.
It's a nice size gun for her.

985
01:47:54,345 --> 01:47:56,847
Would you like me to take you home?

986
01:47:58,266 --> 01:48:00,434
I am home, I suppose.

987
01:48:01,310 --> 01:48:02,352
"F."

988
01:48:04,731 --> 01:48:06,189
"G."

989
01:48:08,109 --> 01:48:09,693
"G" for girl.

990
01:48:15,033 --> 01:48:16,616
Are you packed?

991
01:48:17,452 --> 01:48:18,618
Yes.

992
01:48:19,662 --> 01:48:21,246
How was town?

993
01:48:22,331 --> 01:48:23,665
Crowded.

994
01:48:28,629 --> 01:48:30,380
I've been thinking.

995
01:48:32,174 --> 01:48:36,343
With all the safari work I have
little use for the room at the club.

996
01:48:43,101 --> 01:48:46,604
I don't know that
I'd be any good at this,

997
01:48:47,647 --> 01:48:51,692
but how would it be if I
kept a few things with you?

998
01:48:57,991 --> 01:49:00,493
You would come and go from my house?

999
01:49:02,162 --> 01:49:03,913
If that's all right.

1000
01:49:06,416 --> 01:49:10,044
When the gods want to punish
you they answer your prayers.

1001
01:49:19,930 --> 01:49:21,555
Berkeley's dying.

1002
01:49:24,225 --> 01:49:26,351
What?
Blackwater fever.

1003
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:29,104
Oh, my God.

1004
01:49:30,022 --> 01:49:32,649
I'll go to him.
He wouldn't want you there.

1005
01:49:34,068 --> 01:49:35,110
Why?

1006
01:49:37,071 --> 01:49:40,156
There's a woman there.
She's Somali.

1007
01:49:42,535 --> 01:49:44,953
She's been with him for some time.

1008
01:49:45,788 --> 01:49:47,705
You never told me this.

1009
01:49:50,084 --> 01:49:51,584
I didn't know.

1010
01:50:10,563 --> 01:50:14,566
"...with each one of us
now and forevermore." Amen.

1011
01:50:37,088 --> 01:50:39,298
Strange that Denys isn't here.

1012
01:50:41,134 --> 01:50:43,468
I think he is off with Berkeley.

1013
01:50:53,354 --> 01:50:56,440
In the days and hours
that Denys was at home,

1014
01:50:57,442 --> 01:50:59,776
we spoke of nothing ordinary.

1015
01:51:01,196 --> 01:51:03,572
Not of my troubles with the farm,

1016
01:51:04,532 --> 01:51:07,659
my notes due and my failing crop,

1017
01:51:08,494 --> 01:51:10,578
or of his with his work,

1018
01:51:11,121 --> 01:51:13,748
what he knew was happening to Africa.

1019
01:51:16,793 --> 01:51:21,505
Or of anything at all
that was small and real.

1020
01:51:22,841 --> 01:51:26,093
We lived disconnected

1021
01:51:26,762 --> 01:51:28,846
and apart from things.

1022
01:51:30,641 --> 01:51:33,684
I had been making up stories
while he was away.

1023
01:51:34,561 --> 01:51:37,939
In the evenings,
he made himself comfortable,

1024
01:51:38,273 --> 01:51:41,901
spreading cushions like a
couch in front of the fire,

1025
01:51:42,986 --> 01:51:47,281
and with me sitting cross-legged
like Scherazade herself,

1026
01:51:48,075 --> 01:51:52,870
he would listen
clear-eyed to a long tale,

1027
01:51:53,664 --> 01:51:56,916
from when it began until it ended.

1028
01:52:39,083 --> 01:52:40,542
Where did you get it?

1029
01:52:41,043 --> 01:52:42,544
Mombasa.

1030
01:52:43,212 --> 01:52:44,546
Get in.

1031
01:52:50,052 --> 01:52:51,803
When did you learn to fly?

1032
01:52:52,722 --> 01:52:54,513
Yesterday.

1033
01:56:00,197 --> 01:56:01,530
Don't move.

1034
01:56:08,747 --> 01:56:10,289
I want to move.

1035
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,250
Don't move.

1036
01:56:40,110 --> 01:56:41,569
Hello, Denys.

1037
01:56:45,950 --> 01:56:47,450
May I see you?

1038
01:56:54,542 --> 01:56:56,292
I'm broke, too, you know?

1039
01:56:56,377 --> 01:56:59,921
I wouldn't ask,
but tips were a bit light.

1040
01:57:03,676 --> 01:57:05,218
Are you all right?

1041
01:57:05,302 --> 01:57:06,803
If I get a decent crop.

1042
01:57:09,390 --> 01:57:11,099
I could shoot him.

1043
01:57:15,187 --> 01:57:18,397
I've got this
terrible urge to kiss you.

1044
01:57:21,776 --> 01:57:24,820
He's smarter than I am.
It may go well.

1045
01:57:27,615 --> 01:57:28,907
Good luck.

1046
01:57:42,088 --> 01:57:43,630
You might have asked.

1047
01:57:44,007 --> 01:57:45,424
I did.

1048
01:57:46,843 --> 01:57:48,260
She said yes.

1049
01:58:02,108 --> 01:58:05,319
If I get eaten up sometime
bury me here, will you?

1050
01:58:06,029 --> 01:58:07,654
Whatever's left.

1051
01:58:08,238 --> 01:58:10,781
Just there at the crest of the hill.

1052
01:58:16,955 --> 01:58:18,456
When are you leaving?

1053
01:58:19,207 --> 01:58:20,499
Tomorrow.

1054
01:58:22,419 --> 01:58:25,796
Doesn't it matter to you
that I'm another man's wife?

1055
01:58:27,132 --> 01:58:30,092
What matters to me is
that you tried so hard.

1056
01:58:32,929 --> 01:58:34,680
What time tomorrow?

1057
01:58:44,983 --> 01:58:46,525
Goodbye again.

1058
01:58:47,944 --> 01:58:49,570
How many acres under cultivation?

1059
01:58:49,655 --> 01:58:50,780
Five hundred.

1060
01:58:50,864 --> 01:58:52,573
The rest of it's wild?

1061
01:58:52,949 --> 01:58:54,742
The Kikuyu live there.

1062
01:58:55,452 --> 01:58:57,328
Why don't you move them off?

1063
01:58:57,996 --> 01:58:59,872
Because they live there.

1064
01:59:00,706 --> 01:59:03,166
We'll take it over should you default.

1065
01:59:06,671 --> 01:59:07,837
We've got another year.

1066
01:59:07,922 --> 01:59:09,255
God is great.

1067
01:59:09,340 --> 01:59:10,882
He's charging 3%.

1068
01:59:22,144 --> 01:59:26,523
This Chief says, "Tall children
can come to school now."

1069
01:59:35,282 --> 01:59:40,537
Tell Chief Kinanjui that
reading is a valuable thing.

1070
01:59:41,205 --> 01:59:43,748
His children will remember him well.

1071
01:59:59,139 --> 02:00:00,556
This Chief says,

1072
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:03,767
"British can read and what
good has it done them?"

1073
02:01:34,733 --> 02:01:37,692
Miss Felicity's Spurway.
Clear round.

1074
02:01:38,069 --> 02:01:39,611
She's quite something, that Felicity.

1075
02:01:39,695 --> 02:01:41,279
Yes, indeed.

1076
02:01:43,908 --> 02:01:48,745
The next competitor, Mr.
John Sutton on Castano.

1077
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:52,749
How are you?

1078
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,751
Getting old, I think.

1079
02:01:56,087 --> 02:01:57,128
Not you.

1080
02:01:58,422 --> 02:01:59,923
How is the hunting?

1081
02:02:00,091 --> 02:02:02,551
I'll make a living.
Where's Denys?

1082
02:02:03,594 --> 02:02:06,429
Uganda. Some potentate.

1083
02:02:08,808 --> 02:02:11,935
I thought you might be
wanting a divorce.

1084
02:02:17,024 --> 02:02:20,610
Has she got money?
Of course she's got money.

1085
02:02:23,030 --> 02:02:24,990
Is this important, Bror?

1086
02:02:25,992 --> 02:02:27,325
I suppose.

1087
02:02:28,452 --> 02:02:31,161
I'll have to accuse you of something,

1088
02:02:32,581 --> 02:02:36,292
or did you think you would
have it the other way around?

1089
02:02:37,127 --> 02:02:40,462
Fire away, whatever.
I have surely done it.

1090
02:02:44,301 --> 02:02:45,634
Thank you.

1091
02:02:46,386 --> 02:02:50,306
How do you manage it?
To keep us friends?

1092
02:02:50,640 --> 02:02:52,474
We started that way.

1093
02:02:56,146 --> 02:02:59,148
I'll be happy for you, if I can.

1094
02:03:07,282 --> 02:03:09,325
I remember that quite well.

1095
02:03:33,390 --> 02:03:35,642
When you go away on safari,

1096
02:03:36,477 --> 02:03:38,394
are you ever with someone else?

1097
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:41,522
I'd be with you if I
wanted to be with anyone.

1098
02:03:43,567 --> 02:03:44,984
Do you ever get lonely?

1099
02:03:45,069 --> 02:03:46,277
Sometimes.

1100
02:03:47,029 --> 02:03:49,030
Do you ever wonder if I am lonely?

1101
02:03:50,908 --> 02:03:52,325
No, I don't.

1102
02:03:53,702 --> 02:03:55,870
Do you think about me at all?

1103
02:03:56,705 --> 02:03:57,872
Often.

1104
02:03:58,248 --> 02:04:00,375
But not enough to come back.

1105
02:04:02,086 --> 02:04:05,213
I do come back, all the time.
What is it?

1106
02:04:06,715 --> 02:04:07,882
Nothing.

1107
02:04:15,139 --> 02:04:17,015
Bror has asked me for a divorce.

1108
02:04:17,100 --> 02:04:19,309
He's found someone
that he wants to marry.

1109
02:04:19,519 --> 02:04:22,312
I just thought
we might do that some day.

1110
02:04:23,314 --> 02:04:24,564
Divorce?

1111
02:04:29,487 --> 02:04:31,822
How would a wedding change things?

1112
02:04:31,906 --> 02:04:34,241
I would have someone of my own.

1113
02:04:36,953 --> 02:04:38,412
You wouldn't.

1114
02:04:40,248 --> 02:04:42,416
What's wrong with marriage anyway?

1115
02:04:42,750 --> 02:04:44,251
Have you ever seen one you admire?

1116
02:04:44,335 --> 02:04:46,003
Yes, I have. Many.

1117
02:04:49,882 --> 02:04:51,550
Belfields, for one.

1118
02:04:52,010 --> 02:04:54,636
He sent her home
for the rains in 1910.

1119
02:04:54,929 --> 02:04:57,139
Didn't tell her
they were over until 1913.

1120
02:04:57,265 --> 02:04:59,933
It's not a joke. People marry.
It's not revolutionary.

1121
02:05:00,018 --> 02:05:02,102
Some animals mate for life.

1122
02:05:02,270 --> 02:05:03,270
Geese.

1123
02:05:03,688 --> 02:05:06,231
You use the animals
for your own argument.

1124
02:05:06,315 --> 02:05:07,940
You won't let me use them for mine.

1125
02:05:09,192 --> 02:05:10,526
I'd mate for life.

1126
02:05:13,196 --> 02:05:14,864
One day at a time.

1127
02:05:17,034 --> 02:05:21,245
I'd just like someone to
ask me once, that's all.

1128
02:05:21,496 --> 02:05:24,874
Promise me you'll do that
if I promise to say no?

1129
02:05:24,958 --> 02:05:26,500
Just trust you?

1130
02:05:32,841 --> 02:05:34,467
When you go away,

1131
02:05:35,719 --> 02:05:38,345
you don't always go on safari, do you?

1132
02:05:42,934 --> 02:05:43,934
No.

1133
02:05:44,644 --> 02:05:46,645
You just want to be away.

1134
02:05:48,648 --> 02:05:50,733
It's not meant to hurt you.

1135
02:05:52,402 --> 02:05:53,652
It does.

1136
02:05:55,614 --> 02:05:58,449
I'm with you because I
choose to be with you.

1137
02:05:58,533 --> 02:06:01,951
I don't want to live someone
else's idea of how to live.

1138
02:06:02,036 --> 02:06:03,995
Don't ask me to do that.

1139
02:06:04,080 --> 02:06:05,413
I don't want to find out one day

1140
02:06:05,498 --> 02:06:07,707
that I'm at the end
of someone else's life.

1141
02:06:10,294 --> 02:06:12,879
I'm willing to pay for mine.
To be lonely sometimes,

1142
02:06:12,963 --> 02:06:15,548
to die alone if I have to.
I think that's fair.

1143
02:06:15,633 --> 02:06:18,176
Not quite. You want me
to pay for it as well.

1144
02:06:18,260 --> 02:06:22,180
You have a choice, and you're not
willing to do the same for me.

1145
02:06:25,559 --> 02:06:27,685
I won't be closer to you,

1146
02:06:28,395 --> 02:06:31,856
and I won't love you more
because of a piece of paper.

1147
02:06:45,204 --> 02:06:47,288
See if you can shore it up.

1148
02:07:02,178 --> 02:07:03,512
Let it go.

1149
02:07:06,307 --> 02:07:08,809
This water lives in Mombasa anyway.

1150
02:07:54,980 --> 02:07:56,606
I flew as far as Narok.

1151
02:07:57,107 --> 02:08:00,359
You could see all the ruts
where the lorries had been.

1152
02:08:00,444 --> 02:08:02,320
The Serengeti was still good.

1153
02:08:02,404 --> 02:08:04,488
It would take a week
just getting there.

1154
02:08:10,204 --> 02:08:12,205
And Samburu's still good.

1155
02:08:12,456 --> 02:08:15,041
Where's Belknap?
I haven't seen him.

1156
02:08:18,629 --> 02:08:20,796
He must be in America by now.

1157
02:08:23,842 --> 02:08:25,343
I let him go.

1158
02:08:26,970 --> 02:08:28,429
I had to.

1159
02:08:29,014 --> 02:08:32,266
But you don't want to hear
about the farm, do you?

1160
02:08:32,684 --> 02:08:33,809
Have you got any buttons?

1161
02:08:33,894 --> 02:08:35,353
What are you doing?

1162
02:08:35,812 --> 02:08:36,853
Mending your shirts.

1163
02:08:36,938 --> 02:08:39,147
Don't do that.

1164
02:08:39,941 --> 02:08:41,358
You don't have to do that.

1165
02:08:50,618 --> 02:08:52,869
Maybe I'll try Samburu
day after tomorrow.

1166
02:08:52,995 --> 02:08:54,663
You just got back.

1167
02:08:59,168 --> 02:09:01,586
Felicity asked to come along,

1168
02:09:03,464 --> 02:09:06,591
and I almost said no because I
thought you wouldn't like it.

1169
02:09:06,676 --> 02:09:08,260
There's no reason for her not to come.

1170
02:09:08,344 --> 02:09:09,886
Yes, there is.
I wouldn't like it.

1171
02:09:10,805 --> 02:09:12,264
You want her along?

1172
02:09:12,348 --> 02:09:13,932
I want things that
don't matter not to.

1173
02:09:14,016 --> 02:09:15,600
Tell her no, do it for me.

1174
02:09:15,685 --> 02:09:17,102
Then what else would it be?

1175
02:09:17,186 --> 02:09:19,271
Why is your freedom
more important than mine?

1176
02:09:19,355 --> 02:09:22,274
It isn't. And I've never
interfered with your freedom.

1177
02:09:22,358 --> 02:09:24,985
I'm not allowed to need
you or rely on you

1178
02:09:25,069 --> 02:09:28,113
or expect anything from you!
I'm free to leave!

1179
02:09:29,406 --> 02:09:31,490
But I do need you.
You don't need me.

1180
02:09:31,574 --> 02:09:33,951
If I die will you die?
You don't need me.

1181
02:09:34,035 --> 02:09:36,745
You confuse need with want.
You always have.

1182
02:09:36,830 --> 02:09:39,957
In your world, there
would be no love at all.

1183
02:09:40,041 --> 02:09:42,459
Or the best kind.
The one we wouldn't have to prove!

1184
02:09:42,544 --> 02:09:43,877
You'd live on the moon then.

1185
02:09:43,962 --> 02:09:45,337
Because I won't do it your way?

1186
02:09:45,422 --> 02:09:48,257
Are we assuming there is
one proper way to do this?

1187
02:09:48,341 --> 02:09:50,050
Do you think I care about Felicity?

1188
02:09:50,135 --> 02:09:52,303
Do you think I'll be
involved with her?

1189
02:09:56,558 --> 02:09:57,641
No.

1190
02:09:57,726 --> 02:09:58,976
Then there's no reason
for this, is there?

1191
02:09:59,060 --> 02:10:01,228
If she's not important
why won't you give it up?

1192
02:10:04,065 --> 02:10:06,734
I have learned a thing
that you haven't.

1193
02:10:07,944 --> 02:10:10,571
There are some things worth having,

1194
02:10:11,573 --> 02:10:15,034
but they come at a price,
and I want to be one of them.

1195
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:19,246
I won't allow it.

1196
02:10:22,082 --> 02:10:25,251
You have no idea the effect
that language has on me.

1197
02:10:25,336 --> 02:10:28,004
I used to think there was
nothing you really wanted,

1198
02:10:28,088 --> 02:10:30,089
but that's not it, is it?

1199
02:10:30,382 --> 02:10:32,342
You want to have it all.

1200
02:10:38,265 --> 02:10:41,225
I'm going to Samburu
and she can come or not.

1201
02:10:47,858 --> 02:10:50,193
Then you'll be living elsewhere.

1202
02:10:57,201 --> 02:10:58,534
All right.

1203
02:11:38,491 --> 02:11:40,534
Is there a prince in there?

1204
02:11:58,177 --> 02:12:00,679
I think that you had better get up.

1205
02:12:01,848 --> 02:12:05,851
You had better get up.
I think that God is coming.

1206
02:13:01,906 --> 02:13:03,198
All gone.

1207
02:13:21,175 --> 02:13:22,842
How did it start?

1208
02:13:22,927 --> 02:13:24,594
I think God had a hand in it.

1209
02:13:24,678 --> 02:13:28,014
He gave me my best crop ever
and then he remembered.

1210
02:13:28,432 --> 02:13:30,892
Insurance?
That's for pessimists.

1211
02:13:31,936 --> 02:13:33,520
Where's Denys?

1212
02:13:34,021 --> 02:13:35,355
Who knows?

1213
02:13:37,942 --> 02:13:40,735
It doesn't matter.
The Baroness is broke.

1214
02:13:42,446 --> 02:13:44,113
It's over.

1215
02:13:44,198 --> 02:13:48,034
I've got to find some land
before I go for my Kikuyu.

1216
02:13:48,285 --> 02:13:49,619
You have trouble enough.

1217
02:13:49,703 --> 02:13:52,871
Just a chunk somewhere so
they can stay all together.

1218
02:13:55,750 --> 02:13:59,753
We're just out of coffee,
but I can give you tea.

1219
02:14:01,506 --> 02:14:04,883
There is no arable land that
size outside the reserve.

1220
02:14:04,968 --> 02:14:07,427
And if there were, we'd
not put natives on it.

1221
02:14:07,595 --> 02:14:08,887
Since it's theirs.

1222
02:14:08,972 --> 02:14:13,141
It belongs to the Crown.
What you want is quite impossible.

1223
02:14:13,309 --> 02:14:16,979
It always is.
Who must I see next?

1224
02:14:17,063 --> 02:14:19,690
You've run through us all, I'm afraid.

1225
02:14:20,108 --> 02:14:22,359
We have a new governor, haven't we?

1226
02:14:22,443 --> 02:14:25,195
Sir Joseph.
He hasn't arrived yet.

1227
02:14:25,655 --> 02:14:27,573
But will soon, I'm told.

1228
02:14:28,575 --> 02:14:30,450
You do still ask me to things.

1229
02:14:31,244 --> 02:14:33,328
Captain Jacques Llewllyn.

1230
02:14:33,413 --> 02:14:34,913
Your servant, sir.

1231
02:14:36,749 --> 02:14:40,002
The Honorable Hugh
Chomondeley, Lord Delamere.

1232
02:14:40,086 --> 02:14:41,420
Your servant, sir.

1233
02:14:41,504 --> 02:14:42,754
Lady Delamere.

1234
02:14:47,175 --> 02:14:48,217
Commissioner.

1235
02:14:48,302 --> 02:14:49,427
Baroness.

1236
02:14:49,511 --> 02:14:50,845
The Baroness Von Blixen.

1237
02:14:52,973 --> 02:14:55,808
I'm sorry to know that
Kenya will be losing you.

1238
02:14:56,018 --> 02:14:57,852
You have heard of my trouble then?

1239
02:14:57,936 --> 02:14:59,729
Yes, I regret it.

1240
02:15:00,522 --> 02:15:02,732
Do you know of my problem now?

1241
02:15:04,109 --> 02:15:06,027
This land you want from us...

1242
02:15:06,737 --> 02:15:08,696
Will you help me?

1243
02:15:09,031 --> 02:15:10,948
That's quite difficult.

1244
02:15:15,495 --> 02:15:17,872
Get up, Baroness, please.

1245
02:15:19,625 --> 02:15:22,043
Kenya is a hard country for women.

1246
02:15:23,462 --> 02:15:26,130
So there is a chivalry here of a sort.

1247
02:15:26,214 --> 02:15:29,300
You are a powerful man and
I've no one else to turn to.

1248
02:15:29,384 --> 02:15:31,260
Let's discuss this in the proper way.

1249
02:15:31,345 --> 02:15:34,138
You mustn't be embarrassed.
I've lost everything.

1250
02:15:34,222 --> 02:15:35,806
It costs me very little to beg you.

1251
02:15:35,890 --> 02:15:37,015
Wait.

1252
02:15:38,893 --> 02:15:40,894
Give her a moment, please?

1253
02:15:51,197 --> 02:15:52,947
This land was theirs.

1254
02:15:53,616 --> 02:15:56,618
We took it and now
they've nowhere else to go.

1255
02:15:56,744 --> 02:15:59,746
I'll look into it.
We'll do the best we can.

1256
02:16:01,248 --> 02:16:03,041
May I have your word?

1257
02:16:08,756 --> 02:16:10,256
You have mine.

1258
02:16:20,476 --> 02:16:21,768
Thank you.

1259
02:16:23,270 --> 02:16:27,440
I hope you will be
happy here. I was.

1260
02:16:29,442 --> 02:16:30,984
I'm sorry I won't know you.

1261
02:16:45,625 --> 02:16:48,043
I didn't hear it
until I got to the border.

1262
02:16:48,128 --> 02:16:51,630
It seems I'll do almost
anything to get your attention.

1263
02:16:57,512 --> 02:16:59,638
I've nearly got you packed.

1264
02:17:06,479 --> 02:17:07,521
My poor family.

1265
02:17:07,605 --> 02:17:11,275
I've got them near bankrupt, now I
have to ask them for more money.

1266
02:17:12,777 --> 02:17:14,403
Let me help you.

1267
02:17:16,197 --> 02:17:18,073
You would keep me then?

1268
02:17:23,203 --> 02:17:25,580
I want to be worth something now.

1269
02:17:27,875 --> 02:17:29,500
What will you do?

1270
02:17:30,127 --> 02:17:32,170
After my rummage sale, leave.

1271
02:17:33,213 --> 02:17:37,383
Friday for Mombasa,
and then the boat to Denmark.

1272
02:17:56,236 --> 02:17:57,653
Thank you, Denys.

1273
02:18:08,081 --> 02:18:11,250
You must have them ready
to leave before the rains.

1274
02:18:11,543 --> 02:18:13,460
It is good land, enough for all,

1275
02:18:13,544 --> 02:18:15,212
but they must not fight about it

1276
02:18:15,296 --> 02:18:18,507
or be any trouble to the
authorities, do you understand?

1277
02:18:18,591 --> 02:18:19,758
Or they will lose it.

1278
02:18:19,842 --> 02:18:20,926
Yes.

1279
02:18:21,010 --> 02:18:24,554
You must make them understand
that I will not be here

1280
02:18:25,389 --> 02:18:27,182
to speak for them.

1281
02:18:27,433 --> 02:18:28,725
This land is far?

1282
02:18:28,810 --> 02:18:31,228
By Dagoretti.
Not too far.

1283
02:18:35,566 --> 02:18:39,152
How can it be now?
With me and yourself?

1284
02:18:40,071 --> 02:18:42,864
You will have some money.
Enough, I think.

1285
02:18:43,741 --> 02:18:45,742
I do not speak of money.

1286
02:18:50,081 --> 02:18:53,792
Do you remember how it was on safari?

1287
02:18:54,877 --> 02:18:58,588
In the afternoons I would send
you ahead to look for a camp?

1288
02:18:59,006 --> 02:19:00,841
And you would wait for me.

1289
02:19:00,925 --> 02:19:05,011
And you can see the fire
and come to this place.

1290
02:19:07,764 --> 02:19:08,764
Yes.

1291
02:19:11,059 --> 02:19:12,852
It will be like that.

1292
02:19:15,730 --> 02:19:19,233
Only this time I will go
ahead and wait for you.

1293
02:19:21,611 --> 02:19:24,446
It is far where you are going?

1294
02:19:27,701 --> 02:19:28,742
Yes.

1295
02:19:30,787 --> 02:19:33,289
You must make this fire very big,

1296
02:19:34,291 --> 02:19:36,083
so I can find you.

1297
02:19:43,884 --> 02:19:45,926
Take that out to the lawn.

1298
02:20:26,592 --> 02:20:28,343
Have you had dinner?

1299
02:20:30,721 --> 02:20:31,804
Yes.

1300
02:20:40,356 --> 02:20:41,981
I've packed your things.

1301
02:20:42,066 --> 02:20:44,567
I thought I would
send them on to the club.

1302
02:20:44,652 --> 02:20:46,319
Is that all right?

1303
02:21:08,341 --> 02:21:10,550
This wasn't a very good idea.

1304
02:21:23,731 --> 02:21:27,067
I think we should have had
it this way all the time.

1305
02:21:28,903 --> 02:21:32,072
I don't know.
I was beginning to like your things.

1306
02:21:34,242 --> 02:21:37,244
And I was beginning to
like living without them.

1307
02:21:47,254 --> 02:21:49,714
You've ruined it for me, you know?

1308
02:21:50,966 --> 02:21:52,425
Ruined what?

1309
02:21:56,805 --> 02:21:58,097
Being alone.

1310
02:22:01,351 --> 02:22:02,518
Have I?

1311
02:22:09,443 --> 02:22:11,902
I'd like to come with you to Mombasa.

1312
02:22:15,490 --> 02:22:17,283
Can I fly you there?

1313
02:22:18,785 --> 02:22:20,870
Aren't you going away again?

1314
02:22:21,663 --> 02:22:23,414
I have some things to do
tomorrow at Tsavo,

1315
02:22:23,498 --> 02:22:25,374
but I'll be back on Friday.

1316
02:22:27,627 --> 02:22:28,669
Will that be all right?

1317
02:22:31,882 --> 02:22:32,965
Of course.

1318
02:22:38,387 --> 02:22:42,015
I've got this little thing that
I've learned to do lately.

1319
02:22:43,309 --> 02:22:47,228
When it gets so bad and I think

1320
02:22:48,064 --> 02:22:49,606
I can't go on,

1321
02:22:50,149 --> 02:22:52,358
I try to make it worse.

1322
02:22:54,653 --> 02:22:57,697
I make myself think about
our camp on the river.

1323
02:23:01,702 --> 02:23:03,203
And Berkeley.

1324
02:23:05,414 --> 02:23:08,333
And the first time
that you took me flying.

1325
02:23:10,544 --> 02:23:12,337
How good it all was.

1326
02:23:17,009 --> 02:23:20,011
And when I'm certain
that I can't stand it,

1327
02:23:20,387 --> 02:23:22,764
I go one moment more,

1328
02:23:25,601 --> 02:23:28,268
and then I know I can bear anything.

1329
02:23:32,732 --> 02:23:34,775
Would you like to help me?

1330
02:23:36,111 --> 02:23:37,194
Yes.

1331
02:23:47,789 --> 02:23:49,790
Come dance with me then.

1332
02:24:37,838 --> 02:24:42,383
You were right, you know.
The farm never did belong to me.

1333
02:24:45,220 --> 02:24:47,054
I may have been wrong.

1334
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:50,975
I had a farm in Africa.

1335
02:24:54,438 --> 02:24:55,479
Friday?

1336
02:24:55,564 --> 02:24:56,772
Yes.

1337
02:26:32,117 --> 02:26:33,158
Hello, Bror.

1338
02:26:42,627 --> 02:26:44,503
Would you like a drink?

1339
02:26:47,632 --> 02:26:48,841
Please.

1340
02:27:08,569 --> 02:27:10,486
Denys has been killed.

1341
02:27:12,906 --> 02:27:14,991
His plane crashed at Tsavo.

1342
02:27:36,764 --> 02:27:38,431
There was a fire.

1343
02:27:51,903 --> 02:27:53,904
Can I take you into town?

1344
02:27:57,283 --> 02:27:59,159
Why did they send you?

1345
02:28:02,955 --> 02:28:04,414
I thought I should.

1346
02:28:12,590 --> 02:28:14,341
My God, you're brave.

1347
02:28:53,672 --> 02:28:57,299
"The sun shall not smite
thee by day, nor the moon at night.

1348
02:28:57,384 --> 02:29:00,344
"The Lord shall
preserve thee from all evil.

1349
02:29:00,429 --> 02:29:02,513
"He shall preserve thy soul.

1350
02:29:02,889 --> 02:29:06,308
"The Lord shall preserve thy
going out and thy coming in.

1351
02:29:06,393 --> 02:29:09,145
"From this time forth
and even forevermore."

1352
02:29:09,229 --> 02:29:10,229
Amen.

1353
02:29:37,882 --> 02:29:40,467
"The time you won your town the race

1354
02:29:41,802 --> 02:29:44,637
"We chaired you
through the market-place

1355
02:29:45,055 --> 02:29:47,891
"Man and boy stood cheering by

1356
02:29:47,975 --> 02:29:51,144
"And home we brought
you shoulder-high

1357
02:29:53,147 --> 02:29:56,733
"Smart lad, to slip betimes away

1358
02:29:57,776 --> 02:30:00,653
"From fields where glory does not stay

1359
02:30:02,490 --> 02:30:04,908
"And early though the laurel grows

1360
02:30:05,743 --> 02:30:08,244
"It withers quicker than a rose.

1361
02:30:09,747 --> 02:30:12,123
"Now you will not swell the rout

1362
02:30:12,208 --> 02:30:14,542
"Of lads that wore their honors out

1363
02:30:15,794 --> 02:30:18,087
"Runners whom renown outran

1364
02:30:19,256 --> 02:30:22,634
"And the name died before the man

1365
02:30:25,179 --> 02:30:27,804
"And round that
early-laurelled head

1366
02:30:28,973 --> 02:30:31,934
"Will flock to gaze
the strengthless dead

1367
02:30:33,770 --> 02:30:36,813
"And find unwithered on its curls

1368
02:30:39,317 --> 02:30:41,318
"A garland

1369
02:30:47,617 --> 02:30:49,743
"briefer than a girl's"

1370
02:31:07,345 --> 02:31:10,681
Now take back the soul
of Denys George Finch Hatton,

1371
02:31:13,142 --> 02:31:15,352
whom You have shared with us.

1372
02:31:17,981 --> 02:31:19,772
He brought us joy

1373
02:31:21,692 --> 02:31:23,693
and we loved him well.

1374
02:31:27,114 --> 02:31:28,781
He was not ours.

1375
02:31:32,953 --> 02:31:34,537
He was not mine.

1376
02:32:45,399 --> 02:32:47,609
If I know a song of Africa,

1377
02:32:49,528 --> 02:32:51,279
of the giraffe

1378
02:32:51,614 --> 02:32:55,158
and the African new moon
lying on her back,

1379
02:32:56,744 --> 02:32:59,079
of the ploughs in the fields

1380
02:32:59,580 --> 02:33:02,582
and the sweaty faces
of the coffee pickers,

1381
02:33:04,376 --> 02:33:07,211
does Africa know a song of me?

1382
02:33:09,881 --> 02:33:12,508
Will the air over the plain quiver

1383
02:33:12,592 --> 02:33:15,302
with a color that I have had on?

1384
02:33:17,180 --> 02:33:22,101
Or will the children invent
a game in which my name is?

1385
02:33:24,270 --> 02:33:29,066
Or the full moon throw a shadow
over the gravel of the drive

1386
02:33:30,110 --> 02:33:31,860
that was like me?

1387
02:33:33,530 --> 02:33:37,908
Or will the eagles of the
Ngong Hills look out for me?

1388
02:33:50,797 --> 02:33:53,132
You cannot come where I'm going.

1389
02:33:53,216 --> 02:33:55,926
There is no cooking
where you are going?

1390
02:33:57,136 --> 02:33:59,137
You would not like it there.

1391
02:34:00,055 --> 02:34:02,140
You must trust me about this.

1392
02:34:24,621 --> 02:34:27,749
Letters you can send on
to this address in Denmark.

1393
02:34:28,125 --> 02:34:29,417
When you sell the car,

1394
02:34:29,501 --> 02:34:31,919
if you would send the check
to Hunter & Company,

1395
02:34:32,004 --> 02:34:34,672
and anything else you don't
know what to do with.

1396
02:34:34,798 --> 02:34:36,174
Yes, ma'am.

1397
02:34:39,428 --> 02:34:42,597
I've been sent to ask if
we may stand you a drink.

1398
02:34:43,348 --> 02:34:44,682
Who is "we"?

1399
02:34:46,018 --> 02:34:47,810
The members actually.

1400
02:34:51,689 --> 02:34:53,106
All right.

1401
02:35:09,165 --> 02:35:10,791
Whiskey, please.

1402
02:35:12,126 --> 02:35:13,877
Two whiskeys, please.

1403
02:35:39,904 --> 02:35:43,239
Rose-lipt maidens,
lightfoot lads.

1404
02:35:43,907 --> 02:35:45,741
Hear, hear!

1405
02:35:54,292 --> 02:35:55,626
Thank you.

1406
02:36:04,427 --> 02:36:06,428
This is very dear to me.

1407
02:36:08,974 --> 02:36:11,267
It has helped me to find my way.

1408
02:36:12,894 --> 02:36:14,478
Thank you, msabu.

1409
02:36:31,288 --> 02:36:33,581
I want to hear you say my name.

1410
02:36:36,792 --> 02:36:38,668
You are Karen.

1411
02:36:53,142 --> 02:36:55,143
The mail has come today,

1412
02:36:55,477 --> 02:36:57,896
and a friend writes this to me,

1413
02:36:59,481 --> 02:37:03,818
"The Masai have reported to the
district commissioner at Ngong

1414
02:37:05,029 --> 02:37:08,990
"that many times at sunrise and sunset

1415
02:37:09,992 --> 02:37:14,078
"they have seen lions
on Finch Hatton's grave.

1416
02:37:15,331 --> 02:37:17,999
"A lion and a lioness have come there

1417
02:37:18,834 --> 02:37:23,421
"and stood, or lain
on the grave for a long time.

1418
02:37:25,424 --> 02:37:27,257
"After you went away,

1419
02:37:27,508 --> 02:37:32,012
"the ground around the grave was
leveled out into a sort of terrace.

1420
02:37:33,389 --> 02:37:35,682
"I suppose that the level place

1421
02:37:35,767 --> 02:37:38,518
"makes a good site for the lions.

1422
02:37:39,228 --> 02:37:42,689
"From there they have a view
over the plain,

1423
02:37:43,232 --> 02:37:46,401
"and the cattle
and game on it."

1424
02:37:49,197 --> 02:37:51,198
Denys will like that.

1425
02:37:52,200 --> 02:37:54,326
I must remember to tell him.
