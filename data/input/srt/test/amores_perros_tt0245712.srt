1
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:46,311
Love's a bitch

2
00:00:51,144 --> 00:00:55,039
What did you do?
What did you... ?

3
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,447
- Nothing!
- Nothing? Bullshit!

4
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,829
Fuck, he's bleeding to death.

5
00:01:01,992 --> 00:01:04,131
They still coming?

6
00:01:05,256 --> 00:01:08,103
- They still behind us?
- I can't see them.

7
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:10,623
Shit, he's bleeding a lot.

8
00:01:10,664 --> 00:01:13,347
- Stop the bleeding.
- I can't.

9
00:01:13,384 --> 00:01:15,556
- Use your finger.
- There's too much.

10
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:19,645
Here come those bastards.
Faster!

11
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:21,412
Fuck!

12
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:22,692
Faster!

13
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:26,398
Motherfuckers!

14
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:33,251
- Fucking hell!
- Watch out!

15
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:44,800
- Shit, he fell.
- Is he dead?

16
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,189
Why did you fuck
with those bastards?

17
00:01:48,232 --> 00:01:50,207
Is he dead?

18
00:01:50,248 --> 00:01:51,458
Answer me!

19
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:53,318
No, but he keeps falling.

20
00:01:53,352 --> 00:01:55,524
He's bleeding even more!

21
00:01:59,496 --> 00:02:02,016
- I've covered his wound.
- Get down!

22
00:02:03,848 --> 00:02:05,921
They've got a fucking gun!
Motherfucker!

23
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:24,102
Hurry!
Let's go to Chilaquil's.

24
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:29,279
Motherfucker!

25
00:02:32,264 --> 00:02:34,369
- Faster.
- Get down, man.

26
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,348
Step on it!

27
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,909
The window!

28
00:02:54,952 --> 00:02:57,286
The window,
that's it!

29
00:02:59,336 --> 00:03:04,835
Octavio and Susana

30
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,702
Are you ready?

31
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:28,321
What's your stake?

32
00:03:29,288 --> 00:03:31,393
10,000.

33
00:03:31,432 --> 00:03:33,603
Okay for 10,000?

34
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,429
Let's go.

35
00:03:36,935 --> 00:03:38,659
You're on for 10.

36
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:40,322
10's the stake, señores.

37
00:03:47,304 --> 00:03:49,638
10 on Pancho, 10 on Turco.

38
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,287
Heat 'em up!

39
00:04:01,928 --> 00:04:03,041
Marks!

40
00:04:07,688 --> 00:04:09,314
Let them go!

41
00:04:21,032 --> 00:04:22,887
Cofi!

42
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,636
Cofi!
Cofi, come here!

43
00:04:29,832 --> 00:04:31,937
Fucking dog!

44
00:04:45,448 --> 00:04:47,336
Hello, señora.

45
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,927
How's he been?

46
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,229
Better.
The fever broke.

47
00:04:54,984 --> 00:04:57,602
Susana,
I can't watch him tomorrow.

48
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,687
Why?

49
00:05:00,296 --> 00:05:03,591
I have to help
my sister move,

50
00:05:03,624 --> 00:05:05,511
and go to the market.

51
00:05:05,544 --> 00:05:07,551
Señora, give me a break!

52
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:10,309
I have a match final.
I'll iron tonight.

53
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:11,904
No.

54
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,918
Leave the kid with your mother.

55
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,294
My mother?

56
00:05:16,328 --> 00:05:19,710
Just this week.
Then I'll work it out.

57
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,159
No.

58
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,095
I raised my children,

59
00:05:24,136 --> 00:05:26,722
now you raise yours.

60
00:05:57,544 --> 00:05:59,584
Go on, Turco!

61
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:07,456
Do I stop it?
He'll kill him.

62
00:06:08,456 --> 00:06:11,555
It's cool.
He's back on top.

63
00:06:11,592 --> 00:06:12,901
Kill him!

64
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,528
- What's up, Ma?
- Sit down and eat.

65
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,462
How's it going, little dude?

66
00:06:31,463 --> 00:06:33,406
- How's he doing?
- Better.

67
00:06:39,304 --> 00:06:41,344
Thank you.

68
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:43,206
Know what?
A baby born in Guadalajara

69
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,149
gets a finger up his ass.

70
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:47,974
- Why?
- To see what he'll be.

71
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:51,074
If he kicks,
he'll be a soccer player.

72
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,216
If he screams,
a mariachi.

73
00:06:53,256 --> 00:06:55,939
And if he laughs,
he'll be a homo.

74
00:06:58,024 --> 00:06:59,966
What about girls?

75
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:03,073
We finger them
until they're 18.

76
00:07:03,112 --> 00:07:06,341
Stop bullshitting,
Octavio.

77
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,837
Susana?

78
00:07:10,344 --> 00:07:13,246
Susana?
Did you bleach my uniform?

79
00:07:13,288 --> 00:07:15,590
Look at it!

80
00:07:20,936 --> 00:07:22,496
And Cofi?

81
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:25,862
Where is that fucking dog?

82
00:07:26,856 --> 00:07:28,644
- No "hello"... ?
- Where?

83
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,589
- I don't know.
- Sit and eat.

84
00:07:30,631 --> 00:07:34,243
You let him out again,
right, bitch?

85
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,924
I always tell you to watch it
when you go out!

86
00:07:39,784 --> 00:07:40,831
- Lay off!
- Who asked you?

87
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:44,963
You don't care about that dog.
I feed it.

88
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,869
This is between me
and my wife.

89
00:07:47,911 --> 00:07:50,628
I'm the one who let him go,
so lay off her.

90
00:07:50,664 --> 00:07:52,769
Keep out of it!

91
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:54,662
Shut up, please.

92
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:07,333
Here's your dough,
less 500 for my cut.

93
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:09,539
10 victories in a row!

94
00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:13,437
- Just luck, fatso.
- Cool.

95
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:15,389
- See you Saturday.
- Okay.

96
00:08:16,551 --> 00:08:19,039
What about your fucking dog?

97
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:21,894
Barbecue it if you'd like,
shithead!

98
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:25,695
Champiñon, move that dog!

99
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,658
Fucking dog
can't get enough!

100
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:37,377
Give him to me.

101
00:08:38,344 --> 00:08:39,750
He won't budge.

102
00:08:39,784 --> 00:08:43,079
Sic him on those dogs.
That will cool him off.

103
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:47,871
Good idea.

104
00:09:30,568 --> 00:09:33,415
It's in the bag.

105
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,230
- Hey, that's Octavio's dog.
- Exactly.

106
00:09:44,744 --> 00:09:47,231
- Can I?
- Yes.

107
00:09:51,847 --> 00:09:54,236
Thanks for earlier.

108
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,741
What?

109
00:09:55,783 --> 00:09:59,427
That was cool,
taking the blame.

110
00:10:03,752 --> 00:10:05,345
What happened here?

111
00:10:06,728 --> 00:10:08,615
It's nothing.

112
00:10:10,664 --> 00:10:12,452
Did Ramiro do this to you?

113
00:10:14,408 --> 00:10:16,797
Yes, but he didn't mean it.

114
00:10:18,727 --> 00:10:20,637
Didn't mean it?

115
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,720
You know what he's like.

116
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,797
Why do you put up with it?
He treats you like shit.

117
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,620
Not always.

118
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:38,853
Are you stupid
or just pretending?

119
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:11,782
Someone's here for you.

120
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:16,700
- Hang on.
- Uh-huh.

121
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,495
You know Ramiro doesn't want
Susana in your room.

122
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:25,153
We were watching TV!

123
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:27,493
Your brother doesn't like it,
neither do I.

124
00:11:27,528 --> 00:11:29,437
It's the last time,
you hear me?

125
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:30,789
The last!

126
00:11:32,488 --> 00:11:34,659
- What's up?
- You won't believe it.

127
00:11:34,696 --> 00:11:35,623
What?

128
00:11:35,656 --> 00:11:38,405
Your dog killed
Jarocho's Pancho.

129
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,749
What happened?

130
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,304
Jarocho sicced Pancho
on Cofi,

131
00:11:42,343 --> 00:11:46,020
but Cofi saw him coming.

132
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:47,070
He snapped his neck
and killed him.

133
00:11:47,111 --> 00:11:50,243
- Where's Cofi?
- Here he comes.

134
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,548
Cofi! Here!

135
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:57,094
He's all right.

136
00:11:57,128 --> 00:11:59,266
The other dogs
didn't touch him.

137
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,281
What gives, Octavio?

138
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,003
Know what your dog did?

139
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,723
- Yeah.
- So?

140
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:13,759
It's okay, huh?
It's cool.

141
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,360
Cool?

142
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,276
It's not cool at all.

143
00:12:18,312 --> 00:12:19,839
Bring Pancho.

144
00:12:35,336 --> 00:12:38,019
See what he did?

145
00:12:38,056 --> 00:12:41,055
This dog was worth
at least 20,000 pesos.

146
00:12:42,664 --> 00:12:46,341
Have him stuffed
for your mantel.

147
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,724
Don't be a smartass, kiddo.

148
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:54,110
You have two choices.
Pay me, or pay me.

149
00:12:54,151 --> 00:12:56,158
Why should I pay you?

150
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,501
Want to play with me?
Okay.

151
00:12:58,535 --> 00:13:02,332
Wait!
Why did you set Pancho on him?

152
00:13:09,736 --> 00:13:12,867
Listen,
give me your dog,

153
00:13:12,903 --> 00:13:14,813
and I'll forget it.

154
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:16,830
You're nuts.

155
00:13:18,951 --> 00:13:21,253
Start saving,

156
00:13:21,287 --> 00:13:23,175
'cause you're gonna pay.

157
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:28,262
Make Ramiro pay
if you're so cool.

158
00:13:28,295 --> 00:13:30,204
Afraid he'll kick
your ass again?

159
00:13:31,847 --> 00:13:34,564
No way, asshole.

160
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,901
I'm not taking any more shit.

161
00:13:36,935 --> 00:13:39,204
Got it, Octavio?

162
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,661
Let's go.

163
00:13:49,447 --> 00:13:51,236
What's up?

164
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,274
Got a joint?

165
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:04,189
Ramiro, I need money.

166
00:14:04,231 --> 00:14:07,973
Don't got any.
Payday's Friday.

167
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:09,469
So what do I do?

168
00:14:09,512 --> 00:14:12,097
The baby needs diapers
and formula,

169
00:14:12,135 --> 00:14:14,688
and the eggs you eat
aren't free.

170
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,281
- Got no money.
- "Got no money. "

171
00:14:21,255 --> 00:14:23,622
So you got no money?

172
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,925
Are you deaf?

173
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:28,381
Aren't drugstores
good business?

174
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,847
Keep your mouth shut,
or else.

175
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:37,314
Asshole!

176
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:40,286
One word and you're dead.

177
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:46,140
Being tough
won't make you smart.

178
00:15:30,312 --> 00:15:34,054
- Jimena took my headband.
- Give it back.

179
00:15:34,087 --> 00:15:35,942
It's my headband!

180
00:15:35,975 --> 00:15:38,080
No, it was a gift.

181
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:41,348
Liar, I bought it at the store.

182
00:15:41,383 --> 00:15:43,619
Give it to her.
You never wear it.

183
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:58,566
I'll get it!

184
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:03,519
Hello?

185
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:07,330
- Who was it?
- They hung up.

186
00:16:08,487 --> 00:16:12,382
That mute man again?
Or that mute woman, maybe?

187
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:20,644
I'll get it.

188
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,811
Hello?

189
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,694
Hung up again.

190
00:16:26,727 --> 00:16:28,734
Weird!

191
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:38,886
Can I come in?

192
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,675
What's up?

193
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,708
You going out?

194
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:47,230
Why?

195
00:16:47,271 --> 00:16:49,027
No reason.

196
00:16:51,304 --> 00:16:53,060
Something wrong?

197
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,524
I...

198
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,570
What happened?

199
00:16:57,607 --> 00:17:00,706
I'm in trouble.
I don't know what to do.

200
00:17:02,663 --> 00:17:06,406
I'm pregnant again.

201
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,301
Shit, Susana, you want
another baby already?

202
00:17:10,343 --> 00:17:12,002
I didn't want it!

203
00:17:13,351 --> 00:17:15,806
Ramiro is going to kill me.

204
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:21,028
No, he won't.

205
00:17:21,063 --> 00:17:23,136
He went nuts once,

206
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,444
but he still married you,
didn't he?

207
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:32,198
Yes, but I don't know
if I want to stay with him.

208
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:37,062
I can't have this baby,
Octavio.

209
00:17:38,151 --> 00:17:40,420
Are you thinking
about an abortion?

210
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,268
Do you have a better idea?

211
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:45,986
What the fuck can I do?

212
00:17:48,423 --> 00:17:50,016
Come away with me.

213
00:17:51,207 --> 00:17:52,865
What?

214
00:17:52,903 --> 00:17:54,691
Let's go away.

215
00:17:54,727 --> 00:17:56,832
Far away.

216
00:17:56,871 --> 00:17:58,726
I'm being serious!

217
00:17:58,759 --> 00:17:59,872
So am I.

218
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:03,424
Don't talk shit.
Where would we go?

219
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:12,352
- What are you doing, you jerk?
- Come away with me.

220
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:24,774
- How many are they?
- Six bitches, three dicks.

221
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:26,149
- Ready?
- Wait.

222
00:18:26,183 --> 00:18:28,867
That fat bitch is going in.
I smell cash.

223
00:18:28,903 --> 00:18:31,391
Ever fucked a fatso like her?

224
00:18:31,431 --> 00:18:35,555
- I have, it's hot.
- You have? Who?

225
00:18:35,591 --> 00:18:37,763
Your mother, asshole.

226
00:18:39,271 --> 00:18:44,225
Someday we'll do
that fucking bank, you'll see.

227
00:18:44,263 --> 00:18:48,158
- Keep cool, Tarzan.
- We're going big time, man.

228
00:18:48,199 --> 00:18:51,101
After that fucking bank,
I'm out of here.

229
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:52,834
It's not safe around here.

230
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,677
We're on, she's in.

231
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,791
Everyone down on the floor!

232
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:42,853
BUSINESSMAN MURDERED
MOTIVE UNKNOWN

233
00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:19,744
MR. EZQUERRA'S WIDOW,
MRS. NORMA SAINZ, DIED

234
00:20:19,782 --> 00:20:22,171
FUNERAL AT 10:30 A. M.

235
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,789
What's up?

236
00:21:09,831 --> 00:21:11,806
Want some dinner?

237
00:21:11,847 --> 00:21:13,986
Look what I brought you.

238
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:17,154
Cool!

239
00:21:17,191 --> 00:21:20,289
No way! For me?

240
00:21:20,327 --> 00:21:21,571
Like it?

241
00:21:22,855 --> 00:21:25,059
Was a bitch to get it.

242
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:43,107
Shh!

243
00:21:48,871 --> 00:21:51,456
Don't shout,
you'll wake the baby.

244
00:21:51,495 --> 00:21:52,771
Hang on.

245
00:21:56,038 --> 00:21:57,861
Baldy?

246
00:21:59,047 --> 00:22:01,316
- Don't wake him.
- Why not?

247
00:22:02,311 --> 00:22:04,198
It was hard
to get him to sleep.

248
00:22:04,231 --> 00:22:06,881
I never see him,
do I, Baldy?

249
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:09,188
He's been puking all day.

250
00:22:09,222 --> 00:22:10,651
He's sick.

251
00:22:11,655 --> 00:22:13,629
Selfish bastard!

252
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:17,216
Shut the fuck up.
I gave you the Walkman!

253
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:21,477
I'm cool to you,
but you're always on my ass!

254
00:22:21,511 --> 00:22:22,438
The baby, shit!

255
00:22:22,471 --> 00:22:23,877
Shut up!

256
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:53,595
Wow, dude...
she's your brother's woman.

257
00:22:54,823 --> 00:22:57,125
Yeah,
but I always liked her,

258
00:22:57,159 --> 00:22:59,232
even before they met.

259
00:22:59,271 --> 00:23:02,140
But he got her first.

260
00:23:02,182 --> 00:23:03,524
My ass!

261
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:05,599
Ramiro doesn't care about her.

262
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:10,308
But Susana does.
You're playing with fire, man.

263
00:23:10,343 --> 00:23:12,482
I can't stop thinking about her.

264
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:16,447
There's thousands of bitches.
Why do you want to fuck her?

265
00:23:16,487 --> 00:23:18,374
I don't want to fuck her!

266
00:23:18,407 --> 00:23:20,828
I want her to leave with me.

267
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:24,166
Yeah?
With what money?

268
00:23:28,071 --> 00:23:29,926
You're going to fight him?

269
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,733
Where do we get
the bet money?

270
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:38,657
- I'll pimp your sister.
- You asshole!

271
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:09,538
Well?

272
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:11,843
Phone call for Susana.

273
00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:13,406
Who is it?

274
00:24:13,447 --> 00:24:15,967
Her mother.

275
00:24:16,007 --> 00:24:18,210
Tell her to fuck off.

276
00:24:18,247 --> 00:24:20,636
She says it's urgent.

277
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:33,414
Hello?

278
00:24:36,327 --> 00:24:38,083
Who was it?

279
00:24:41,127 --> 00:24:42,653
Me.

280
00:24:42,695 --> 00:24:44,996
You're nuts.

281
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:51,548
What's wrong with you?

282
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:54,755
Let go. Let go.

283
00:24:59,783 --> 00:25:01,725
No, Octavio.

284
00:25:04,775 --> 00:25:06,749
Not this way.

285
00:25:09,671 --> 00:25:12,256
Then how?

286
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:20,773
This dog
looks pretty sad to me.

287
00:25:20,807 --> 00:25:23,295
But it killed Jarocho's dog.

288
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:25,953
You know this business?

289
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,878
More or less.

290
00:25:27,911 --> 00:25:29,918
More or less?

291
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:33,473
- Sargento?
- Yes.

292
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,806
Sarge, take this dog.
Come with me.

293
00:25:43,431 --> 00:25:46,497
This is my business.
Zero taxes,

294
00:25:46,534 --> 00:25:48,868
zero strikes, zero unions.

295
00:25:49,863 --> 00:25:51,935
Pure hard cash.

296
00:25:51,975 --> 00:25:55,171
I take a loss now and then.

297
00:25:56,294 --> 00:25:59,426
This is Mac,
my best investment.

298
00:25:59,463 --> 00:26:02,496
He's old,
but he can still fight.

299
00:26:02,535 --> 00:26:05,317
I got the van
from his winnings.

300
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,772
We can be partners,

301
00:26:07,814 --> 00:26:11,360
with your dog,
and my stake money.

302
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:14,148
We'll split the profits 50-50.

303
00:26:14,182 --> 00:26:16,386
What do you think?

304
00:26:16,423 --> 00:26:18,910
- Sounds good.
- Good.

305
00:26:18,951 --> 00:26:22,660
Good for eight fights,
then we'll see.

306
00:26:22,695 --> 00:26:23,872
Fine.

307
00:26:23,911 --> 00:26:26,726
But first, your dog
goes a round with Mac.

308
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:34,267
Okay, it will cost you
5,000, win or lose.

309
00:26:41,158 --> 00:26:44,835
Don't bullshit me.

310
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:47,107
What if your dog kills mine?

311
00:26:47,143 --> 00:26:48,997
And what if mine dies?

312
00:26:49,031 --> 00:26:51,584
But I don't have a van yet.

313
00:26:54,918 --> 00:26:58,148
I'll give you 2, 500.
Will that do?

314
00:26:59,623 --> 00:27:00,800
Done.

315
00:27:09,414 --> 00:27:12,578
Condom!
Bring Mac.

316
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,732
Here's your take.

317
00:27:23,494 --> 00:27:26,145
Release them on three.
Count.

318
00:27:26,182 --> 00:27:27,971
One...

319
00:27:29,095 --> 00:27:30,917
two...

320
00:27:30,951 --> 00:27:31,899
three!

321
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,495
That's enough.

322
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,444
Take your fucking dog.

323
00:27:44,486 --> 00:27:45,697
Sarge!

324
00:27:48,358 --> 00:27:50,147
Come back on Saturday
at 12:00.

325
00:27:50,182 --> 00:27:53,565
It's payback time for Jarocho.

326
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:06,464
- 20 is your change.
- Thank you.

327
00:28:08,582 --> 00:28:11,070
Did you find
everything you needed?

328
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,532
Except rubbers.

329
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:16,355
You don't have my size.

330
00:28:16,391 --> 00:28:17,765
What the fuck
are you doing here?

331
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:19,260
Shopping.

332
00:28:19,302 --> 00:28:21,026
Where did you get
the dough?

333
00:28:21,062 --> 00:28:22,688
You don't have money,
but I do.

334
00:28:22,726 --> 00:28:26,752
Stick it up your ass.
I'll buy my family's things.

335
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:29,092
Ring me up,
or I'll call the manager.

336
00:28:30,535 --> 00:28:33,764
Asshole,
get out or you're dead.

337
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:38,206
I'm not Susana, you know.
You don't scare me.

338
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:47,908
- What happened?
- Nothing, nothing.

339
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:49,884
Fucking hell!

340
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,692
Good afternoon.

341
00:29:06,503 --> 00:29:09,405
- Take it.
- What for?

342
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,487
So you can
take care of him.

343
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:14,210
And him.

344
00:29:34,534 --> 00:29:35,909
Yes?

345
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:38,430
Hey, brother, how are you?

346
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:42,245
I'm very well.
No, not much.

347
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:45,410
Hang on.

348
00:29:45,446 --> 00:29:47,356
I can't hear anything.

349
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:49,918
Neither can I.
Why don't you leave?

350
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:01,085
What's up?

351
00:30:02,822 --> 00:30:06,564
I couldn't get away.
Tomorrow, I promise.

352
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:08,867
I miss you, too.

353
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:15,618
Don't call here anymore,
Julieta's suspicious.

354
00:30:15,654 --> 00:30:19,396
No, I'm not angry.

355
00:30:20,423 --> 00:30:22,594
Tomorrow at 11:00.

356
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,452
I love you.

357
00:30:50,118 --> 00:30:52,028
What's the matter?

358
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:54,209
Stop!

359
00:30:57,478 --> 00:30:58,787
Stop, man!

360
00:30:58,822 --> 00:31:01,375
Keep out of my business,
asshole!

361
00:31:27,014 --> 00:31:29,251
Here, pal, take this.

362
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,958
- What's up, fatso?
- Just hanging, Jarocho.

363
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,746
Why are you playing
with girls?

364
00:31:35,782 --> 00:31:37,538
Because they got mean dogs.

365
00:31:37,574 --> 00:31:39,876
You're betting 15 on it?

366
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:41,885
My dog beats all of yours.

367
00:31:41,927 --> 00:31:44,163
I'm talking to the ringmaster,
princess.

368
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:46,238
So...

369
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,384
- 15?
- Make it 10.

370
00:31:48,422 --> 00:31:49,916
Okay.

371
00:31:50,918 --> 00:31:53,122
Place your bets, señores.

372
00:32:03,942 --> 00:32:05,950
Waste him!

373
00:32:11,078 --> 00:32:12,704
Kill him!

374
00:32:18,726 --> 00:32:20,482
Ready?

375
00:32:24,358 --> 00:32:25,667
Let them go!

376
00:33:13,926 --> 00:33:16,894
I'll catch up.

377
00:33:34,726 --> 00:33:36,733
What are you doing here?

378
00:33:36,774 --> 00:33:38,717
Taking a stroll.

379
00:33:38,758 --> 00:33:41,791
Stroll elsewhere.

380
00:33:41,831 --> 00:33:44,830
Don't mess with us,
and especially not her.

381
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:47,619
It's a free country, isn't it?

382
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:53,986
To her, you're dead.
Don't forget that.

383
00:33:54,022 --> 00:33:56,510
You're hostile, sister-in-law!

384
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,717
That's two you owe me.

385
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,743
Don't be pissed, Jarochito.
Win some, lose some.

386
00:34:40,006 --> 00:34:41,533
What's up?

387
00:34:43,334 --> 00:34:44,861
Here.

388
00:34:44,902 --> 00:34:46,527
It's yours.

389
00:34:46,566 --> 00:34:49,348
But hide it, or my brother
will take it.

390
00:34:49,382 --> 00:34:50,811
Don't worry.

391
00:34:50,854 --> 00:34:52,828
Got another place
to stash it?

392
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:57,311
Yes. I put that other money
in a case in the closet.

393
00:34:59,238 --> 00:35:00,580
Shh!

394
00:35:00,614 --> 00:35:02,469
The baby's sleeping!

395
00:35:05,702 --> 00:35:08,353
This will be our bank, okay?

396
00:35:09,638 --> 00:35:11,526
Just yours and mine.

397
00:35:11,558 --> 00:35:13,566
Octavio, you stealing too?

398
00:35:13,606 --> 00:35:15,515
No.

399
00:35:15,558 --> 00:35:18,820
This money's clean,
so you'll come away with me.

400
00:35:18,854 --> 00:35:20,828
Come away with you?

401
00:35:27,142 --> 00:35:29,531
You still don't get it,
do you?

402
00:35:29,574 --> 00:35:32,257
No, you don't get it.

403
00:35:32,294 --> 00:35:35,523
Jorge has cousins in Juarez.
We'll go there.

404
00:35:35,558 --> 00:35:39,006
We can open a store,
we got cash.

405
00:35:39,046 --> 00:35:40,475
It'll be cool.

406
00:35:42,854 --> 00:35:46,018
No, I don't want any more trouble.
Can't you understand?

407
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,158
Understand?

408
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:04,097
Come away with me.

409
00:36:28,773 --> 00:36:31,294
# Golden and growing ripe
in my land #

410
00:36:31,334 --> 00:36:34,563
# I'm ready to fly
while my people await #

411
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:38,659
# Twigs I go around sowing
to see if they sprout #

412
00:36:38,694 --> 00:36:41,061
# Northern wind,
thought and life #

413
00:36:41,094 --> 00:36:44,226
# I carry St. Peter in my breath
and the saliva I spit #

414
00:36:44,262 --> 00:36:46,401
# Anytime I feel right #

415
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:48,642
# And I do it
complete and directly #

416
00:36:48,678 --> 00:36:51,133
# Yes, sir #

417
00:36:51,174 --> 00:36:53,792
# Yes, sir,
Coming, coming, coming, coming #

418
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,969
# Yes, sir #

419
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:58,559
# Wind, caresses,
levity and flavor #

420
00:36:58,598 --> 00:37:00,899
# Yes, sir #

421
00:37:00,934 --> 00:37:03,585
# Yes, sir,
Coming, coming, coming, coming #

422
00:37:03,622 --> 00:37:05,597
# Yes, sir #

423
00:37:05,638 --> 00:37:08,485
# Fire, smiles, reality and pain #

424
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,390
# The ground is present #

425
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:14,080
# Waiting, representing,
it comes down at night #

426
00:37:14,118 --> 00:37:15,394
# Singing me to sleep,
I'm unconscious #

427
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,819
# On my belly
the seconds pass #

428
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:20,545
# Charged, tattooed on my back,
soaking wet #

429
00:37:20,582 --> 00:37:22,971
# Joined to spasms
of crying and laughter #

430
00:37:23,014 --> 00:37:25,435
# I've been around,
slowly but carefully #

431
00:37:25,478 --> 00:37:27,682
# Just as slow as the moment
that doesn't end #

432
00:37:27,718 --> 00:37:30,052
# Just as slow,
crossing through the thorns #

433
00:37:30,086 --> 00:37:32,639
# Tell me what it feels like,
tell me what it feels like #

434
00:37:32,678 --> 00:37:34,980
# Tell me what it feels like,
the sweat in your brow #

435
00:37:35,013 --> 00:37:37,566
# Tell me what it feels like,
tell me what it feels like #

436
00:37:37,606 --> 00:37:40,093
# Tell me what it feels like,
the sweat in your brow #

437
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:42,589
# Yes, sir #

438
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,997
# Yes, sir,
Coming, coming, coming, coming #

439
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,233
# Yes, sir #

440
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:50,237
# Wind, caresses,
levity and flavor #

441
00:37:50,277 --> 00:37:52,317
# Yes, sir #

442
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:54,747
# Yes, sir,
Coming, coming, coming, coming #

443
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:57,179
# Yes, sir... #

444
00:38:03,846 --> 00:38:05,886
I didn't say you could come in.

445
00:38:05,926 --> 00:38:08,130
What are you watching?

446
00:38:09,126 --> 00:38:10,816
None of your business.

447
00:38:10,854 --> 00:38:13,788
Change that shit.
I don't like it.

448
00:38:15,174 --> 00:38:16,123
What do you want?

449
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:18,915
I heard you're getting rich
with my dog.

450
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,608
Your car is nice.

451
00:38:20,645 --> 00:38:24,606
Your dog?
He's mine.

452
00:38:24,646 --> 00:38:27,101
Don't talk shit,
little brother!

453
00:38:27,142 --> 00:38:30,655
He's as much mine as yours,
so I get half of the winnings.

454
00:38:30,693 --> 00:38:33,989
Anyway, look at him.

455
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:36,804
Doesn't look like
you care about him much.

456
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:39,293
I care more than you know.

457
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:42,497
Give you money?
I'm not giving you shit.

458
00:38:42,534 --> 00:38:44,290
It's simple...

459
00:38:45,638 --> 00:38:50,821
cough it up, or I'll blow
your piggy bank away.

460
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,164
Next time's for real,

461
00:38:56,198 --> 00:38:59,013
so you better get me
my dough.

462
00:39:38,661 --> 00:39:41,182
"The cock crows... "

463
00:39:43,334 --> 00:39:47,011
What's up, baldy?
Look what I got you!

464
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:57,634
Look at all this!
Your mom's going to put it away.

465
00:40:00,614 --> 00:40:02,556
We're millionaires!

466
00:40:02,598 --> 00:40:05,632
There's enough to live on
for two years.

467
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,906
Come live them with me.

468
00:40:07,942 --> 00:40:09,884
What do you say, eh?

469
00:40:11,558 --> 00:40:14,906
- Why, Octavio?
- Why what?

470
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,924
Why do you want
to live them with me?

471
00:40:23,398 --> 00:40:25,886
You still don't get it?

472
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:28,609
No, I do get it.

473
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:55,139
Give Jorge
something to eat.

474
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:01,154
I've got some business for you.

475
00:42:01,189 --> 00:42:03,491
Jarocho's got a class A dog.

476
00:42:03,525 --> 00:42:04,932
He wants to fight Cofi.

477
00:42:04,966 --> 00:42:07,355
Yeah, right!

478
00:42:07,398 --> 00:42:11,773
- He'll bet 40,000.
- 40?

479
00:42:11,813 --> 00:42:12,926
You in?

480
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:15,453
That's too much for me.

481
00:42:16,678 --> 00:42:20,988
- You're on your own.
- What about our deal?

482
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:24,030
The deal was for eight fights.
We've done 15.

483
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:28,347
That's enough. You won,
I won, that's it.

484
00:42:28,389 --> 00:42:30,048
Okay.

485
00:42:30,086 --> 00:42:31,777
When does he want to fight?

486
00:42:33,862 --> 00:42:35,717
This Saturday.

487
00:42:35,749 --> 00:42:39,459
He wants it private,
at Trujillo's. No outside bets,

488
00:42:39,493 --> 00:42:41,828
just you and him.

489
00:42:42,789 --> 00:42:44,382
All right.

490
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,232
Do I confirm?

491
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:48,796
Okay.

492
00:42:51,494 --> 00:42:53,698
Hey, fatso,

493
00:42:53,733 --> 00:42:56,832
I need you to do me
a big favor.

494
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:20,346
# A giants' joust turns the air
into natural gas #

495
00:43:22,886 --> 00:43:25,919
# A wild duel warns me #

496
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:31,773
# How close I am of going
into an outrageous world #

497
00:43:31,814 --> 00:43:35,523
# I feel my fragility #

498
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:40,866
# Some nightmare
running away #

499
00:43:40,902 --> 00:43:44,862
# With a beast after me #

500
00:43:47,014 --> 00:43:50,243
# Tell me everything's a lie #

501
00:43:50,277 --> 00:43:52,895
# Just a silly dream
and nothing more #

502
00:43:52,934 --> 00:43:55,781
# I'm afraid of enormity #

503
00:43:55,814 --> 00:43:59,294
# Where nobody hears my voice #

504
00:44:02,342 --> 00:44:04,513
# Stop the deception #

505
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:08,030
# Don't try to hide #

506
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:11,997
# That you've never tripped
while moving around #

507
00:44:14,597 --> 00:44:16,452
# Paper monster #

508
00:44:16,486 --> 00:44:19,966
# I don't know
who I'm up against #

509
00:44:20,005 --> 00:44:24,195
# Or is there
somebody else here? #

510
00:44:27,494 --> 00:44:31,007
# I believe in the terrible ghosts #

511
00:44:31,046 --> 00:44:33,664
# Of some strange place #

512
00:44:35,621 --> 00:44:41,699
# And in my foolishness to make you
burst into laughter #

513
00:44:41,733 --> 00:44:44,733
# In an outrageous world #

514
00:44:44,774 --> 00:44:48,254
# I feel your fragility #

515
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:53,221
# Stop the deception #

516
00:44:53,253 --> 00:44:56,156
# Don't try to hide #

517
00:44:56,198 --> 00:45:00,671
# That you've never tripped
while moving around #

518
00:45:03,078 --> 00:45:05,183
# Paper monster #

519
00:45:05,221 --> 00:45:08,538
# I don't know
who I'm up against... #

520
00:45:09,669 --> 00:45:11,360
How's the baby?

521
00:45:11,398 --> 00:45:14,813
Good.
Growing, I guess.

522
00:45:14,853 --> 00:45:16,479
Got a name yet?

523
00:45:16,518 --> 00:45:18,754
Umm...

524
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:22,587
if it's a girl, Susana.

525
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:25,728
And if it's a boy?

526
00:45:26,726 --> 00:45:28,351
Octavio?

527
00:45:38,342 --> 00:45:41,157
Everything's ready.
We leave Sunday.

528
00:45:42,501 --> 00:45:45,218
But I'm going to need
some of the money.

529
00:45:46,597 --> 00:45:49,379
Saturday's the big one.

530
00:45:50,341 --> 00:45:54,814
Don't fight him anymore.
We've got enough.

531
00:45:54,854 --> 00:45:56,861
One last one?

532
00:46:02,405 --> 00:46:05,088
What time is the bus
to Juarez?

533
00:46:06,853 --> 00:46:08,860
It leaves at 12:00.

534
00:46:08,902 --> 00:46:11,552
Ramiro will still be at work.

535
00:46:14,533 --> 00:46:16,802
Don't worry about Ramiro.

536
00:46:19,077 --> 00:46:22,012
He won't fuck with us anymore,
I'm sure.

537
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:30,876
Are you scared?

538
00:46:32,645 --> 00:46:34,620
It's heavy shit.

539
00:46:36,965 --> 00:46:38,721
Scared?

540
00:46:57,062 --> 00:46:58,109
Ma?

541
00:46:59,909 --> 00:47:03,553
Ma?

542
00:47:04,805 --> 00:47:07,620
So this is how
you take care of the kid?

543
00:47:19,046 --> 00:47:21,631
Shh!
What's wrong?

544
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:24,037
Now you can stay drunk.

545
00:47:51,941 --> 00:47:53,348
What's up, Ma?

546
00:47:53,381 --> 00:47:55,650
Do you know what happened
to your brother?

547
00:47:55,685 --> 00:47:58,205
He didn't come home last night.

548
00:47:58,246 --> 00:47:59,969
No idea.

549
00:48:01,093 --> 00:48:02,555
You don't know?

550
00:48:03,845 --> 00:48:05,787
He got beat up bad.

551
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:09,146
He must have pissed off
a customer.

552
00:48:11,205 --> 00:48:13,758
They threatened to kill him.

553
00:48:13,797 --> 00:48:16,186
God knows what he's up to!

554
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:21,596
He left with the baby
and Susana.

555
00:48:25,157 --> 00:48:26,335
Where to?

556
00:48:26,373 --> 00:48:27,999
I don't know where.

557
00:48:28,037 --> 00:48:30,972
Or if they'll be back.

558
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:35,196
What?

559
00:48:50,598 --> 00:48:53,118
Goddamn it!

560
00:48:55,877 --> 00:48:59,193
Motherfucker!
And that bitch!

561
00:49:32,933 --> 00:49:35,170
People Today

562
00:49:36,326 --> 00:49:41,825
With us today, someone
no man would want to miss...

563
00:49:41,861 --> 00:49:46,466
one of the most beautiful
women in Iberian America,

564
00:49:46,501 --> 00:49:48,956
Valeria Amaya!

565
00:49:51,237 --> 00:49:52,731
Thank you so much.

566
00:49:56,965 --> 00:49:59,202
I have to find her, damn it!

567
00:49:59,237 --> 00:50:02,717
She tricked you.
I warned you.

568
00:50:02,757 --> 00:50:05,506
It wasn't her.
It was Ramiro, that asshole.

569
00:50:09,797 --> 00:50:12,764
This is your year.

570
00:50:12,806 --> 00:50:15,489
You represent "Enchant"
in Latin America,

571
00:50:15,525 --> 00:50:17,348
loads of models envy you...

572
00:50:18,501 --> 00:50:21,185
I'll find her!

573
00:50:21,221 --> 00:50:22,977
How much you got?

574
00:50:23,013 --> 00:50:25,217
- 7,000, and you?
- 10,000.

575
00:50:25,253 --> 00:50:28,515
I hope Jarocho
will go with that.

576
00:50:28,549 --> 00:50:31,331
I've got 3,000 at home,
I'll loan them to you.

577
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:36,641
That woman's hot!

578
00:50:36,677 --> 00:50:38,750
Is it true
you have a new love?

579
00:50:38,789 --> 00:50:41,724
Yes, it's not just a rumor.

580
00:50:41,765 --> 00:50:43,805
In fact, he's here.

581
00:50:43,845 --> 00:50:45,503
My love!

582
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:48,094
Andres Salgado, no less!

583
00:50:57,605 --> 00:50:59,547
Please, have a seat.

584
00:51:01,285 --> 00:51:04,154
What a lucky guy!

585
00:51:07,621 --> 00:51:09,956
Let's go. Cofi!

586
00:51:14,789 --> 00:51:18,499
Okay, one more
personal question.

587
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:21,152
Will you two get married?

588
00:51:21,189 --> 00:51:25,345
Not right away,
but we have a son...

589
00:51:25,381 --> 00:51:28,316
and I brought him.

590
00:51:28,357 --> 00:51:29,818
Richie!

591
00:51:32,165 --> 00:51:34,554
Isn't he cute!

592
00:51:36,069 --> 00:51:38,109
He looks just like Andres!

593
00:51:38,149 --> 00:51:40,320
He's got my white hair.

594
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:57,251
What's up?
You didn't back out?

595
00:51:57,285 --> 00:52:00,220
- As you can see.
- You get the 40,000?

596
00:52:01,861 --> 00:52:04,828
- I only got 20,000.
- Will that do?

597
00:52:06,661 --> 00:52:10,338
You're on.
Playing for candy!

598
00:52:11,941 --> 00:52:14,462
Sargento,
put the dogs in the pool.

599
00:52:16,773 --> 00:52:18,813
Ready!

600
00:52:18,853 --> 00:52:20,130
On your marks!

601
00:52:24,773 --> 00:52:25,701
Release them!

602
00:52:44,165 --> 00:52:45,442
You crazy fucker!

603
00:52:46,757 --> 00:52:48,318
Fight's over!

604
00:52:48,357 --> 00:52:50,975
He was winning!
Why did you shoot?

605
00:52:51,013 --> 00:52:54,395
- It just went off.
- What's this shit?

606
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:56,347
It's between you and him.

607
00:52:56,389 --> 00:52:58,877
Here's your money. And yours.

608
00:52:58,917 --> 00:53:00,892
This isn't fair,
Mauricio!

609
00:53:00,933 --> 00:53:02,722
Work it out between you.

610
00:53:02,757 --> 00:53:06,205
Don't be crybabies.
That's the business.

611
00:53:06,245 --> 00:53:10,849
You better scram,
before things heat up.

612
00:53:12,197 --> 00:53:15,874
Complain to your brother.
I'll be waiting for him!

613
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:36,163
- Where are you going?
- Start the car, wait for me.

614
00:53:50,117 --> 00:53:52,932
Forget something,
princess?

615
00:54:20,581 --> 00:54:22,305
What did you do?

616
00:54:23,012 --> 00:54:24,922
- What did you...
- Nothing!

617
00:54:24,965 --> 00:54:26,688
Nothing? Bullshit!

618
00:54:31,269 --> 00:54:33,440
- Is he dead?
- No!

619
00:54:39,717 --> 00:54:42,172
Why did you fuck
with those bastards?

620
00:54:47,461 --> 00:54:49,152
Assholes!

621
00:55:02,501 --> 00:55:05,817
Thanks to Valeria Amaya
and Andres Salgado

622
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:07,999
for being on the show.

623
00:55:08,036 --> 00:55:11,233
Friends, stay with us
for more surprises

624
00:55:11,268 --> 00:55:13,178
on "People Today. "

625
00:55:17,061 --> 00:55:20,923
Valeria, I thought
you were with someone else.

626
00:55:20,965 --> 00:55:22,973
Well, now you know.

627
00:55:23,013 --> 00:55:27,999
- So many rumors.
- People love gossip.

628
00:55:28,037 --> 00:55:30,274
- Laura, 20 seconds!
- Right, goodbye.

629
00:55:31,717 --> 00:55:34,684
- What are you doing now?
- Nothing, why?

630
00:55:34,725 --> 00:55:38,041
- Have lunch with me.
- No thanks, Andres.

631
00:55:40,357 --> 00:55:44,961
You would say no
to Andres Salgado?

632
00:55:44,997 --> 00:55:49,088
Listen, the show's over.
The show is over.

633
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:51,972
I have a surprise you'll love.

634
00:55:55,045 --> 00:55:57,827
Okay, let's go.

635
00:56:03,108 --> 00:56:05,858
- Where are you going?
- To the restaurant.

636
00:56:05,892 --> 00:56:09,154
I said lunch,
I didn't say where.

637
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:19,069
- Come in.
- Did you buy this place?

638
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:22,404
- Not exactly.
- It's lovely!

639
00:56:22,437 --> 00:56:25,088
- You like it?
- Of course!

640
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:28,954
This couch is just like mine.

641
00:56:28,997 --> 00:56:30,523
It's not like yours.

642
00:56:30,565 --> 00:56:32,255
It is yours.

643
00:56:32,293 --> 00:56:34,944
In the bedroom,
you'll find your clothes,

644
00:56:34,981 --> 00:56:36,836
your perfumes...

645
00:56:38,884 --> 00:56:40,543
What are you playing at?

646
00:56:40,581 --> 00:56:44,159
That's not all.
Look at the view!

647
00:56:47,653 --> 00:56:49,792
You like it?

648
00:56:49,829 --> 00:56:51,716
You've gone too far.
I'm going.

649
00:56:51,749 --> 00:56:53,658
Wait!

650
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:57,181
Take the keys
to your apartment.

651
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,424
What do you mean,
my apartment?

652
00:56:59,461 --> 00:57:03,105
That's right,
you're home!

653
00:57:04,292 --> 00:57:05,220
Idiots!

654
00:57:06,533 --> 00:57:07,645
Darling!

655
00:57:10,085 --> 00:57:11,873
What's this hole?

656
00:57:11,909 --> 00:57:14,756
I had enough to buy it,
but not to fix it.

657
00:57:15,301 --> 00:57:17,210
Okay, enough!

658
00:57:18,373 --> 00:57:21,406
- You're jealous.
- Thanks!

659
00:57:21,445 --> 00:57:23,332
I've never seen you
acting so well.

660
00:57:23,365 --> 00:57:25,405
You liked it?

661
00:57:25,445 --> 00:57:28,893
- I love you, too.
- Sorry.

662
00:57:28,933 --> 00:57:30,875
I was joking.

663
00:57:30,917 --> 00:57:32,477
Bye!

664
00:57:32,517 --> 00:57:33,891
Wow!

665
00:57:33,925 --> 00:57:35,713
Thanks.

666
00:57:35,749 --> 00:57:39,131
Thanks for the magazine cover.

667
00:57:39,173 --> 00:57:40,601
Good luck, matador.

668
00:57:44,101 --> 00:57:46,719
My love, is it really true?

669
00:57:48,293 --> 00:57:50,268
- Honey?
- What?

670
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:52,611
I spoke with Julieta.

671
00:57:52,645 --> 00:57:54,947
And?

672
00:57:54,980 --> 00:58:01,243
- As of today, we're separated.
- You're not lying to me?

673
00:58:01,285 --> 00:58:03,838
Starting tonight,
we can sleep together.

674
00:58:03,876 --> 00:58:06,178
Are you sure about this?

675
00:58:06,213 --> 00:58:08,962
I am.
Have you changed your mind?

676
00:58:08,997 --> 00:58:11,004
I just can't believe it!

677
00:58:43,428 --> 00:58:45,632
- Darling?
- Yes?

678
00:58:45,669 --> 00:58:47,327
What shall we toast with?

679
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:53,627
Ah, I knew
I forgot something.

680
00:58:53,669 --> 00:58:56,386
Please,
keep an eye on the food.

681
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:58,809
You know I can't fry an egg.

682
00:58:58,852 --> 00:59:00,892
You're my special guest!

683
00:59:00,933 --> 00:59:03,005
A guest in my own home?

684
00:59:05,445 --> 00:59:07,812
You are the guest.
Stay here.

685
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:08,892
Darling...

686
00:59:08,933 --> 00:59:11,486
Richie!

687
00:59:11,524 --> 00:59:14,274
- Come over here.
- Hurry back.

688
00:59:14,308 --> 00:59:15,999
You bet I will.

689
00:59:36,677 --> 00:59:39,546
# Corazón... #

690
00:59:39,589 --> 00:59:41,792
# Mi corazón #

691
00:59:43,493 --> 00:59:47,617
# Corazón...
mi corazón #

692
00:59:47,652 --> 00:59:51,067
Richie! Shut up!
What's the matter?

693
00:59:57,573 --> 01:00:00,289
# Corazón... #

694
01:00:00,932 --> 01:00:02,874
# Mi corazón #

695
01:00:16,356 --> 01:00:21,539
Daniel and Valeria

696
01:00:35,492 --> 01:00:37,980
Excuse us.

697
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:39,297
So?

698
01:00:39,332 --> 01:00:41,983
It's hard to diagnose...

699
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:44,835
massive blood loss,

700
01:00:44,869 --> 01:00:46,843
double fractured
tibia and fibula,

701
01:00:46,884 --> 01:00:50,114
open fractured femur...

702
01:00:50,148 --> 01:00:54,425
the femoral biceps are
almost completely severed.

703
01:00:54,469 --> 01:00:57,785
- It's a miracle she's alive.
- Will she make it?

704
01:00:57,828 --> 01:01:01,887
- I hope so.
- When can I see her?

705
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:06,878
I don't know... in two days,
depending on how she recovers.

706
01:01:07,877 --> 01:01:10,397
Is there a relative
I should notify?

707
01:01:10,437 --> 01:01:13,852
Her family's in Spain.
I don't know if I should tell them.

708
01:01:14,885 --> 01:01:17,186
Will you take the responsibility?

709
01:01:20,197 --> 01:01:23,677
- Thanks, Nacho.
- No problem. My regards to Julieta.

710
01:01:23,716 --> 01:01:26,586
Sorry, it's habit.

711
01:01:26,628 --> 01:01:28,286
Kiss your girls for me.

712
01:01:28,325 --> 01:01:29,819
No problem.

713
01:01:35,397 --> 01:01:38,047
One, two, three.

714
01:01:43,077 --> 01:01:45,280
Don't tire her out.

715
01:01:45,317 --> 01:01:46,593
No.

716
01:01:50,309 --> 01:01:53,058
I'll never play soccer again.

717
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:58,143
Shh! Take it easy.

718
01:01:59,397 --> 01:02:01,153
And Richie?

719
01:02:01,188 --> 01:02:03,424
He's fine, he's at home.

720
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:05,249
Our home...

721
01:02:08,228 --> 01:02:10,530
Our home...

722
01:02:12,516 --> 01:02:14,753
- Daniel...
- Huh?

723
01:02:14,788 --> 01:02:16,927
Don't tell my father.

724
01:02:16,964 --> 01:02:20,542
- Isn't it time you spoke to him?
- I don't want to.

725
01:02:20,581 --> 01:02:22,970
He'd say I deserved it.

726
01:02:24,996 --> 01:02:27,517
Okay. Don't worry.

727
01:02:29,508 --> 01:02:34,910
Sleep... sleep.
I'm here with you.

728
01:02:39,173 --> 01:02:41,409
- Daniel?
- Huh?

729
01:02:41,445 --> 01:02:43,616
Are you awake?

730
01:02:44,612 --> 01:02:46,139
What is it?

731
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:48,897
Daniel, I'm scared.

732
01:02:49,892 --> 01:02:51,266
Look at me!

733
01:02:51,301 --> 01:02:54,945
Don't worry,
they'll take it off.

734
01:02:54,981 --> 01:02:57,664
You've been very brave.

735
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:02,009
The truth is...

736
01:03:02,053 --> 01:03:05,086
I'm scared to death.

737
01:03:05,124 --> 01:03:08,605
You'll be fine, you'll see.

738
01:03:16,869 --> 01:03:19,356
Richie, look!
Look who's here!

739
01:03:19,397 --> 01:03:22,463
- Your mommy is back.
- Richie!

740
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:27,551
I missed you,
my little one.

741
01:03:30,212 --> 01:03:32,830
What did you do
without me?

742
01:03:36,069 --> 01:03:38,174
My love!

743
01:03:38,212 --> 01:03:40,601
Welcome home, my love!

744
01:03:44,709 --> 01:03:47,229
The first one
to blink loses, eh?

745
01:03:59,909 --> 01:04:01,818
No!

746
01:04:05,636 --> 01:04:08,287
You lose, you lose!

747
01:04:16,932 --> 01:04:18,874
What are you doing?

748
01:04:18,917 --> 01:04:20,989
I'm examining you.

749
01:04:21,028 --> 01:04:25,120
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

750
01:04:25,156 --> 01:04:27,044
I can't.

751
01:04:27,076 --> 01:04:28,931
Yes, you can.

752
01:04:30,372 --> 01:04:32,445
Let's see how you do it.

753
01:04:38,948 --> 01:04:42,690
Sure you'll be all right?

754
01:04:42,724 --> 01:04:45,277
Sure. I'm an expert.

755
01:04:45,316 --> 01:04:48,350
Left... right...

756
01:04:49,476 --> 01:04:51,232
What if you need something?

757
01:04:51,268 --> 01:04:54,530
I've got Richie, don't I?

758
01:04:56,772 --> 01:05:00,995
Whatever you do,
stay seated.

759
01:05:01,028 --> 01:05:03,876
- Even if the earth quakes?
- Let it crumble.

760
01:05:03,908 --> 01:05:06,047
But you don't leave that chair!

761
01:05:07,044 --> 01:05:09,411
- I'll be back by 8:00.
- I'll be here.

762
01:05:09,445 --> 01:05:12,063
- Good luck.
- I'll miss you.

763
01:07:13,828 --> 01:07:15,933
Fetch, sweetheart.

764
01:07:15,972 --> 01:07:18,655
Good.
Bring it back.

765
01:07:24,068 --> 01:07:27,297
Good, Richie.
You're a good boy.

766
01:07:27,332 --> 01:07:28,509
Bring me the ball.

767
01:07:33,252 --> 01:07:36,416
Run, run!
No, Richie!

768
01:07:37,828 --> 01:07:41,309
Shit! Richie!

769
01:07:41,348 --> 01:07:43,235
Richie, good boy!

770
01:07:45,892 --> 01:07:46,907
Richie?

771
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:50,046
Richie!

772
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,824
Mommy's here!

773
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:56,161
Richie!

774
01:08:02,468 --> 01:08:04,224
It's me!

775
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:07,547
I'm in the kitchen.

776
01:08:07,588 --> 01:08:08,930
How did it go?

777
01:08:08,964 --> 01:08:12,313
From the doctor,
so I don't have to carry you.

778
01:08:13,924 --> 01:08:16,128
How's my princess?

779
01:08:16,164 --> 01:08:18,553
Richie went into the hole.

780
01:08:18,596 --> 01:08:19,806
How?

781
01:08:19,844 --> 01:08:22,429
He was running after the ball.

782
01:08:22,468 --> 01:08:24,256
He'll get out.

783
01:08:24,292 --> 01:08:26,179
That was five hours ago.

784
01:08:29,252 --> 01:08:32,351
What can we do?

785
01:08:34,372 --> 01:08:36,380
- I know!
- What are you doing?

786
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:38,525
Chocolates.

787
01:08:38,564 --> 01:08:41,913
He'll come right out.

788
01:08:41,956 --> 01:08:44,128
Wait, I'm coming with you.

789
01:08:44,164 --> 01:08:48,507
Here, try the crutches.

790
01:08:48,548 --> 01:08:50,687
Why won't he come out?

791
01:08:50,724 --> 01:08:53,506
He must be stuck
down there.

792
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:57,151
Don't worry about it,
he'll come out.

793
01:08:57,188 --> 01:08:58,649
Richie?

794
01:08:59,716 --> 01:09:01,025
I tried that.

795
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:03,678
I hear noises,
but he won't come out.

796
01:09:04,996 --> 01:09:08,128
Don't worry,
he'll come out.

797
01:09:08,164 --> 01:09:10,750
You want an omelet?
I'm hungry.

798
01:09:12,388 --> 01:09:15,649
He's all right.
A bit disoriented, but he's here,

799
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:19,808
not stolen, not lost.
He's here with us, okay?

800
01:09:28,452 --> 01:09:29,761
Daniel?

801
01:09:30,756 --> 01:09:32,644
- Daniel?
- What?

802
01:09:32,676 --> 01:09:34,432
Listen, it's Richie.

803
01:09:44,964 --> 01:09:46,939
Yes, it's him.

804
01:09:49,092 --> 01:09:51,165
- So?
- Wait.

805
01:09:55,236 --> 01:09:59,806
Richie?

806
01:10:08,708 --> 01:10:10,596
Richie?

807
01:10:11,812 --> 01:10:13,219
- Richie?
- Daniel?

808
01:10:13,252 --> 01:10:16,252
- What?
- Hurry, I think I heard him.

809
01:10:19,076 --> 01:10:21,115
- Where is he?
- Help me.

810
01:10:22,116 --> 01:10:23,523
Careful.

811
01:10:28,356 --> 01:10:31,073
He's under the living room.

812
01:10:31,108 --> 01:10:34,403
Richie, darling...

813
01:10:43,556 --> 01:10:45,443
Richie?

814
01:10:53,252 --> 01:10:57,408
Oh, shit!
That scared me!

815
01:11:01,284 --> 01:11:02,745
Hello?

816
01:11:04,516 --> 01:11:05,596
Hello?

817
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:12,002
- Who was it?
- I don't know. They hung up.

818
01:11:14,948 --> 01:11:15,930
Richie?

819
01:11:33,764 --> 01:11:35,552
Manuel, bastard!

820
01:11:35,588 --> 01:11:39,330
- Where have you been?
- Working, dear. How are you?

821
01:11:39,363 --> 01:11:42,876
- I'm getting there.
- Take it easy, huh?

822
01:11:42,916 --> 01:11:45,850
In a month,
if all goes well,

823
01:11:45,892 --> 01:11:47,964
I'll be back
on the Enchant campaign.

824
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:50,524
Enchant?
Forget about that.

825
01:11:50,564 --> 01:11:51,677
What do you mean?

826
01:11:51,716 --> 01:11:54,683
Listen, the contract
with Enchant is finished.

827
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:57,819
- They pulled out?
- What did you expect?

828
01:11:57,860 --> 01:12:00,609
They hired you
when you were well.

829
01:12:00,644 --> 01:12:02,782
Be realistic,
you're not well.

830
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:05,056
When you get well,
like before,

831
01:12:05,092 --> 01:12:08,321
we'll contact Enchant
and it'll be fine...

832
01:12:30,499 --> 01:12:31,928
Richie!

833
01:12:33,188 --> 01:12:34,748
Richie!?

834
01:12:34,787 --> 01:12:37,755
Jesus, Richie!
Shit!

835
01:12:46,244 --> 01:12:48,131
Son of a bitch!

836
01:12:50,755 --> 01:12:53,177
Fuck you, Richie!

837
01:12:59,651 --> 01:13:01,058
Richie!

838
01:13:02,275 --> 01:13:04,250
Richie!

839
01:13:04,291 --> 01:13:07,106
My darling?
Richie?

840
01:13:07,396 --> 01:13:08,476
Richie?

841
01:13:10,244 --> 01:13:12,219
Aah!

842
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:21,209
The title goes higher,

843
01:13:21,252 --> 01:13:23,227
and the photo to the left.

844
01:13:24,451 --> 01:13:25,728
Like that?

845
01:13:25,764 --> 01:13:26,811
A bit more.

846
01:13:26,852 --> 01:13:29,666
Or raise the photo
and bring the text down?

847
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,937
No,
that breaks the harmony.

848
01:13:33,028 --> 01:13:35,362
Mr. Estrada, telephone.

849
01:13:35,396 --> 01:13:38,178
Tell them I'll call back later.

850
01:13:38,212 --> 01:13:39,935
It seems urgent.

851
01:13:39,971 --> 01:13:41,630
I think it's your wife.

852
01:13:41,668 --> 01:13:43,391
Excuse me.

853
01:13:48,355 --> 01:13:50,843
Julieta, what's the matter?

854
01:13:50,883 --> 01:13:52,290
Julieta, answer me.

855
01:13:52,324 --> 01:13:54,266
I'm not Julieta.

856
01:13:54,308 --> 01:13:57,537
Darling!
I'm sorry, my secretary...

857
01:13:57,572 --> 01:13:59,514
What would you say
to Julieta?

858
01:13:59,556 --> 01:14:02,971
- Nothing, it was a mistake.
- What would you say?

859
01:14:03,011 --> 01:14:06,143
- I swear.
- Well?

860
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:08,897
This isn't like you.
What's wrong?

861
01:14:12,451 --> 01:14:15,451
Valeria?
My love?

862
01:14:16,484 --> 01:14:18,720
The rats ate Richie.

863
01:14:20,387 --> 01:14:21,816
What rats?

864
01:14:23,844 --> 01:14:25,600
What happened, honey?

865
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:30,522
There are thousands
of rats down there.

866
01:14:33,027 --> 01:14:34,554
How do you know?

867
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:37,912
I saw them.
I'm sure they ate Richie.

868
01:14:37,956 --> 01:14:40,225
Don't worry.

869
01:14:41,315 --> 01:14:45,658
Rats don't eat dogs.
They would get bitten.

870
01:14:45,699 --> 01:14:48,033
But there are thousands of them.

871
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:53,340
We could put out
some rat poison.

872
01:14:53,379 --> 01:14:55,583
Richie would eat it.

873
01:14:57,156 --> 01:14:59,425
We could send a cat down.

874
01:14:59,459 --> 01:15:01,631
A cat would fight with Richie.

875
01:15:01,667 --> 01:15:03,806
So what the fuck do we do?

876
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:15,587
I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry.

877
01:15:18,499 --> 01:15:22,777
- Everything will be fine.
- You're not in my position.

878
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:27,162
Look at my leg,
it'll be covered with scars.

879
01:15:27,204 --> 01:15:29,375
Plastic surgery
has come a long way.

880
01:15:29,411 --> 01:15:31,713
You'll hardly see any scars...

881
01:15:31,747 --> 01:15:33,853
Don't fucking touch me!

882
01:15:44,259 --> 01:15:46,976
It's Richie!

883
01:15:47,012 --> 01:15:48,800
Richie!

884
01:15:50,339 --> 01:15:52,162
- Richie!
- He heard you shouting.

885
01:15:52,195 --> 01:15:53,144
Richie!

886
01:15:53,188 --> 01:15:54,976
It's him!

887
01:15:55,012 --> 01:16:00,001
Richie!

888
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:04,280
- I know!
- Where are you going?

889
01:16:05,955 --> 01:16:07,003
Richie!

890
01:16:07,044 --> 01:16:09,946
If I make it bigger,
he'll come out.

891
01:16:09,987 --> 01:16:12,191
The rats will come out!

892
01:16:12,228 --> 01:16:13,657
They didn't
come out before,

893
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:16,383
I don't know
why they'd come out now.

894
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:19,234
Make the hole as big as you can.

895
01:16:20,547 --> 01:16:23,165
Shit! Richie!

896
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:28,034
Hello?

897
01:16:28,067 --> 01:16:31,383
Hello?
Who's there?

898
01:16:31,428 --> 01:16:33,631
Fuck your mother!

899
01:16:37,956 --> 01:16:40,411
Who was that, Daniel?

900
01:16:40,451 --> 01:16:42,142
No idea.

901
01:16:44,164 --> 01:16:46,106
When I used to call,
you knew it was me.

902
01:16:46,148 --> 01:16:48,123
So who is it?

903
01:16:48,164 --> 01:16:51,131
I don't know, okay?

904
01:17:20,996 --> 01:17:23,451
Valeria, what's the matter?

905
01:17:23,491 --> 01:17:26,753
My leg really hurts.

906
01:17:26,787 --> 01:17:30,268
- I can't stand it.
- We're going to the hospital.

907
01:17:30,308 --> 01:17:33,243
No, I talked to the doctor.

908
01:17:33,284 --> 01:17:36,829
He said it's normal
for it to hurt.

909
01:17:36,868 --> 01:17:39,966
But it feels like
it's going to burst.

910
01:17:41,091 --> 01:17:43,393
Did he prescribe anything?

911
01:17:43,428 --> 01:17:47,039
Tranquilizers
and an anti-inflammatory.

912
01:17:48,099 --> 01:17:50,968
What can I do?

913
01:17:51,012 --> 01:17:52,866
Hold me.

914
01:18:41,219 --> 01:18:42,975
SEE YOU SOON

915
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,340
I'm going to squeeze a little.

916
01:19:24,483 --> 01:19:27,298
- Did you walk on it?
- A little.

917
01:19:41,411 --> 01:19:43,004
Got the X-rays?

918
01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:57,245
Well...
you can get dressed, Valeria.

919
01:19:58,307 --> 01:20:00,696
Margarita, help her.

920
01:20:00,739 --> 01:20:02,528
Come, there's no room here.

921
01:20:08,548 --> 01:20:12,159
Want to order take-out,
or rent a movie?

922
01:20:12,196 --> 01:20:15,229
I'm not in the mood.
I feel lousy.

923
01:20:15,268 --> 01:20:17,634
You're going to be fine.

924
01:20:17,667 --> 01:20:21,082
Goddamn it!
Is that all you can say?

925
01:20:37,411 --> 01:20:40,956
Daniel, Daniel?

926
01:20:40,996 --> 01:20:42,850
It's Richie!

927
01:20:42,883 --> 01:20:44,738
He's whining, listen.

928
01:20:46,211 --> 01:20:48,120
Listen, it's him!

929
01:20:49,091 --> 01:20:52,669
- Get him out.
- How?

930
01:20:52,707 --> 01:20:54,650
Tear up the floor
or something!

931
01:20:54,691 --> 01:20:58,433
I can't tear it up.
I don't have the money to fix it...

932
01:20:58,467 --> 01:21:00,377
Money doesn't matter!

933
01:21:00,419 --> 01:21:02,688
It does right now.

934
01:21:02,724 --> 01:21:04,829
- Get him out!
- He can get himself out!

935
01:21:04,867 --> 01:21:08,129
You faggot!
You've always been selfish!

936
01:21:08,163 --> 01:21:10,367
I gave up
everything for you!

937
01:21:10,404 --> 01:21:14,081
Yeah, your bitchy wife
and your stupid daughters!

938
01:21:14,115 --> 01:21:15,871
Shut up or I'll hit you!

939
01:21:15,908 --> 01:21:19,585
- You piece of shit!
- Go fuck yourself!

940
01:21:19,619 --> 01:21:24,191
- You and that stupid dog!
- You fucking asshole, drop dead!

941
01:21:24,227 --> 01:21:26,366
Drop dead, fucker!

942
01:21:26,403 --> 01:21:28,291
Fucker!

943
01:22:08,004 --> 01:22:10,589
I'll be back around 2:00.

944
01:22:10,628 --> 01:22:13,049
I don't care
if you never come back.

945
01:22:44,995 --> 01:22:46,336
Hello?

946
01:22:48,451 --> 01:22:50,044
Hello?

947
01:22:53,091 --> 01:22:54,651
Daniel?

948
01:22:58,851 --> 01:23:00,574
Sweetheart?

949
01:23:02,724 --> 01:23:04,633
Sweetheart?

950
01:23:29,539 --> 01:23:32,060
Valeria, open the door.

951
01:23:32,099 --> 01:23:33,855
Open up, damn it!

952
01:23:34,275 --> 01:23:36,828
Valeria, open up!

953
01:23:36,867 --> 01:23:38,722
Open up, Valeria!

954
01:24:14,563 --> 01:24:16,832
Valeria, please.

955
01:24:16,867 --> 01:24:19,420
I have nothing
to apologize for,

956
01:24:19,459 --> 01:24:21,631
but all right,
I'm sorry.

957
01:24:21,667 --> 01:24:24,001
Okay now?

958
01:24:25,251 --> 01:24:28,317
Valeria, open up
or I'll do it myself.

959
01:24:29,987 --> 01:24:33,118
On the count of three,
I'm breaking it down.

960
01:24:35,971 --> 01:24:37,181
One...

961
01:24:38,563 --> 01:24:40,156
two...

962
01:24:41,635 --> 01:24:43,774
two and a quarter...

963
01:24:44,995 --> 01:24:46,783
two and a half...

964
01:24:47,843 --> 01:24:51,105
two and three-quarters...

965
01:24:51,139 --> 01:24:52,154
shit!

966
01:24:58,467 --> 01:24:59,809
Valeria.

967
01:24:59,843 --> 01:25:01,534
What happened, honey?

968
01:25:01,571 --> 01:25:03,097
Valeria.

969
01:25:07,555 --> 01:25:10,108
Valeria,
don't do this to me, please!

970
01:25:11,715 --> 01:25:15,905
Valeria, we have to...

971
01:25:15,939 --> 01:25:17,826
Valeria!

972
01:25:37,443 --> 01:25:38,817
How is she?

973
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:44,218
She had severe arterial thrombosis,
which affected the tissues.

974
01:25:44,259 --> 01:25:49,474
We should have intervened earlier.
There is a lot of damage.

975
01:25:50,595 --> 01:25:53,050
No blood could get
to the muscles.

976
01:25:53,091 --> 01:25:54,400
And?

977
01:25:54,435 --> 01:25:58,297
Advanced gangrene set in...

978
01:25:58,339 --> 01:26:00,827
and I had to amputate the leg.

979
01:26:04,707 --> 01:26:06,431
I'm sorry, Daniel.

980
01:26:58,655 --> 01:27:01,625
Richie!

981
01:27:04,959 --> 01:27:06,333
Richie!

982
01:27:10,304 --> 01:27:12,092
Richie!

983
01:27:20,127 --> 01:27:22,102
Richie!

984
01:27:22,143 --> 01:27:24,118
Richie?

985
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:27,159
Richie!

986
01:27:46,239 --> 01:27:47,253
Richie!

987
01:27:51,711 --> 01:27:52,955
Richie!

988
01:29:39,167 --> 01:29:43,673
SPACE AVAILABLE

989
01:30:02,015 --> 01:30:07,449
El Chivo and Maru

990
01:30:13,439 --> 01:30:15,162
Hello?

991
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:16,213
Yes.

992
01:30:18,047 --> 01:30:20,251
Tell him 3:00.

993
01:30:20,287 --> 01:30:22,709
Cancel the other one.

994
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:23,679
Bye.

995
01:30:24,799 --> 01:30:27,930
When we get to the house,
turn that shit off.

996
01:30:27,967 --> 01:30:29,658
He hates that crap.

997
01:30:31,104 --> 01:30:34,780
Why do we need 40 sandwiches?

998
01:30:34,815 --> 01:30:37,466
It's a gift for a friend, okay?

999
01:30:39,647 --> 01:30:42,713
Sure your friend
will do a good job?

1000
01:30:42,751 --> 01:30:44,955
I told you 20 times he will.

1001
01:30:47,327 --> 01:30:50,588
Who is this friend?
Is he a cop too?

1002
01:30:50,623 --> 01:30:53,340
No, he was locked up
for 20 years.

1003
01:30:54,335 --> 01:30:55,612
What for?

1004
01:30:55,647 --> 01:30:57,076
He was a guerrilla.

1005
01:30:57,119 --> 01:30:59,508
Like the Zapatistas?

1006
01:31:00,512 --> 01:31:04,538
That's right,
only he was a real son of a bitch.

1007
01:31:04,575 --> 01:31:06,714
He planted a bomb in a mall,

1008
01:31:06,751 --> 01:31:08,507
kidnapped a banker,

1009
01:31:08,543 --> 01:31:09,918
killed cops...

1010
01:31:09,951 --> 01:31:11,512
Turn here.

1011
01:31:11,551 --> 01:31:15,348
He had an army after him,
the White Brigade.

1012
01:31:16,383 --> 01:31:17,627
You know who got him?

1013
01:31:17,663 --> 01:31:20,445
- Who?
- Me!

1014
01:31:22,271 --> 01:31:24,410
I caught him pissing
at Sanborn's Café!

1015
01:31:27,807 --> 01:31:29,563
Can you believe that?

1016
01:31:29,599 --> 01:31:31,225
Hello?

1017
01:31:32,543 --> 01:31:33,591
No.

1018
01:31:33,631 --> 01:31:37,341
Deposit that money
in my account.

1019
01:31:39,295 --> 01:31:42,045
I'll transfer it.
Bye.

1020
01:31:45,983 --> 01:31:48,122
What do I say to him?

1021
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:50,198
Nothing.
I'll do the talking.

1022
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:52,628
Don't ask personal questions.

1023
01:31:52,671 --> 01:31:53,686
Why not?

1024
01:31:53,727 --> 01:31:55,614
It pisses him off.

1025
01:31:55,647 --> 01:31:58,330
He was a normal guy,
like you and me.

1026
01:31:59,871 --> 01:32:03,516
He was a college teacher,
and one day, boom!

1027
01:32:03,551 --> 01:32:07,032
He dumps his wife and daughter
and becomes a guerrilla.

1028
01:32:07,071 --> 01:32:09,722
- And his family?
- What do you think?

1029
01:32:09,759 --> 01:32:11,221
They told him to go to hell!

1030
01:32:11,263 --> 01:32:12,954
His wife remarried.

1031
01:32:12,991 --> 01:32:15,162
I guess his daughter
thinks he's dead.

1032
01:32:16,351 --> 01:32:20,759
When he got out of the can,
he went fucking nuts.

1033
01:32:20,799 --> 01:32:23,701
When I found him,
he was a wino.

1034
01:32:23,743 --> 01:32:25,172
I felt sorry for him.

1035
01:32:26,175 --> 01:32:28,793
I gave him some cash
and a place to live.

1036
01:32:28,831 --> 01:32:31,679
We even became pals.
He started doing jobs for me.

1037
01:32:33,503 --> 01:32:36,252
Jobs... like this one?

1038
01:32:36,287 --> 01:32:38,360
Yeah.

1039
01:32:38,399 --> 01:32:41,181
I'll get it.

1040
01:32:44,831 --> 01:32:46,173
Why did you do that?

1041
01:32:46,207 --> 01:32:47,702
You'll buy another one!

1042
01:33:06,463 --> 01:33:08,351
What's up, Chivito?

1043
01:33:08,383 --> 01:33:12,922
What's up, Leonardo?
You all right?

1044
01:33:12,959 --> 01:33:16,341
Met my friend,
Gustavo Garfias.

1045
01:33:17,759 --> 01:33:19,766
Hello, brother.

1046
01:33:19,807 --> 01:33:20,985
Pleased to meet you.

1047
01:33:21,983 --> 01:33:23,609
This is for you.

1048
01:33:26,078 --> 01:33:27,420
Great!

1049
01:33:29,439 --> 01:33:31,511
Cool.

1050
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:48,151
No chili,
no onion. Perfect!

1051
01:33:48,191 --> 01:33:49,565
Thanks.

1052
01:33:52,383 --> 01:33:53,845
Sit there.

1053
01:33:58,495 --> 01:34:01,757
Did you lose your glasses?

1054
01:34:01,791 --> 01:34:03,733
I stopped using them.

1055
01:34:03,774 --> 01:34:05,913
If God wants me to see blurry,

1056
01:34:05,951 --> 01:34:07,893
I'll see blurry.

1057
01:34:11,743 --> 01:34:14,842
My friend Gustavo
needs a favor.

1058
01:34:14,879 --> 01:34:16,919
The photograph.

1059
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:22,712
I don't do that anymore.

1060
01:34:22,751 --> 01:34:25,501
I told you last time.

1061
01:34:25,535 --> 01:34:27,062
Come on.

1062
01:34:27,103 --> 01:34:30,103
How are you going to live?
On trash?

1063
01:34:30,143 --> 01:34:32,216
Trash provides, Leonardo.

1064
01:34:32,255 --> 01:34:34,197
Really.

1065
01:34:34,238 --> 01:34:36,573
Look, a Citizen.

1066
01:34:36,607 --> 01:34:39,869
I found it in the dumpster.
This, too.

1067
01:34:39,902 --> 01:34:45,172
Don't bullshit me.
You stole it!

1068
01:34:45,215 --> 01:34:47,287
No, I found it.

1069
01:34:47,326 --> 01:34:50,622
The Commander says
you are very good.

1070
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:57,053
Good at what?

1071
01:34:57,087 --> 01:35:00,600
Come on, take it.
Don't fuck around.

1072
01:35:04,735 --> 01:35:06,229
Who is he?

1073
01:35:09,791 --> 01:35:11,831
My partner.

1074
01:35:11,871 --> 01:35:13,398
What did he do?

1075
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:16,254
He's cheating me.

1076
01:35:17,727 --> 01:35:20,444
How much are you paying?

1077
01:35:20,479 --> 01:35:23,708
50,000 now, 50,000 after.

1078
01:35:25,247 --> 01:35:29,109
100 now, 50 after.

1079
01:35:30,174 --> 01:35:31,581
Done?

1080
01:35:31,615 --> 01:35:34,517
Okay,
but I only have 50 on me.

1081
01:35:40,543 --> 01:35:43,892
- His name?
- Luis Miranda Solares.

1082
01:35:43,935 --> 01:35:46,455
He lives at 1460
Sierra de Maika.

1083
01:35:46,494 --> 01:35:48,731
He works on Montes
Urales Street.

1084
01:35:50,431 --> 01:35:52,253
Real blue collar, huh!

1085
01:36:00,127 --> 01:36:01,272
All right.

1086
01:36:05,759 --> 01:36:07,962
Make it look like a robbery.

1087
01:36:07,999 --> 01:36:10,268
No people, no trouble...

1088
01:36:10,303 --> 01:36:11,863
Of course, brother.

1089
01:36:11,903 --> 01:36:15,351
No people,
no trouble, no shit.

1090
01:36:24,095 --> 01:36:27,029
# All those who think
that life's unfair #

1091
01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:29,558
# Need to know that
it isn't so #

1092
01:36:29,598 --> 01:36:31,508
# That life is beautiful #

1093
01:36:31,551 --> 01:36:33,656
# You've got to live it #

1094
01:36:33,694 --> 01:36:36,662
# Those who think they're
sick and alone #

1095
01:36:36,703 --> 01:36:38,590
# They need to know that
it isn't so #

1096
01:36:38,623 --> 01:36:40,794
# In life no one's alone #

1097
01:36:40,831 --> 01:36:42,838
# Someone's always there #

1098
01:36:42,878 --> 01:36:44,886
# Oh, no need to cry #

1099
01:36:44,927 --> 01:36:47,480
# Life is a carnival #

1100
01:36:47,519 --> 01:36:50,170
# It's better to live singing #

1101
01:36:50,206 --> 01:36:53,916
# Oh, no need to cry #

1102
01:36:53,950 --> 01:36:56,372
# Life is a carnival #

1103
01:36:56,415 --> 01:36:59,415
# You've got to sing
your cares away #

1104
01:36:59,454 --> 01:37:02,902
# Oh, no need to cry #

1105
01:37:02,942 --> 01:37:05,211
# Life is a carnival #

1106
01:37:05,247 --> 01:37:07,865
# It's better to live singing #

1107
01:37:07,902 --> 01:37:10,772
# Oh, no need to cry #

1108
01:37:10,815 --> 01:37:13,532
# Life is a carnival #

1109
01:37:13,567 --> 01:37:17,593
# You've got to sing
your cares away... #

1110
01:40:55,838 --> 01:40:58,457
Richie!
What's the matter?

1111
01:41:30,815 --> 01:41:35,070
Help me!
The door's stuck.

1112
01:41:35,103 --> 01:41:37,623
I've got a machete in my cart.

1113
01:41:42,175 --> 01:41:43,701
Call an ambulance!

1114
01:41:46,271 --> 01:41:47,831
Hang on.

1115
01:41:52,478 --> 01:41:54,169
Stay calm, stay calm.

1116
01:41:57,118 --> 01:41:58,679
Move aside.

1117
01:41:58,718 --> 01:42:01,140
- What is it?
- His foot is stuck.

1118
01:42:02,751 --> 01:42:03,896
Calm down!

1119
01:42:05,438 --> 01:42:08,121
Calm down!
Careful with his leg.

1120
01:42:09,342 --> 01:42:10,804
Keep still, kid!

1121
01:42:17,247 --> 01:42:19,101
The other kid?

1122
01:42:23,550 --> 01:42:25,274
He's dead already!

1123
01:42:29,342 --> 01:42:31,447
An ambulance! Christ!

1124
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:45,463
Calm down,
you'll be right out.

1125
01:42:45,503 --> 01:42:48,569
Open the window.
Try to open it!

1126
01:42:49,951 --> 01:42:51,195
They're here.

1127
01:42:55,230 --> 01:42:57,619
Keep away!
Let him breathe!

1128
01:42:57,662 --> 01:42:59,702
Can you hear me?

1129
01:43:01,182 --> 01:43:04,630
- The window! There!
- Help me, please!

1130
01:43:04,670 --> 01:43:05,652
Lower!

1131
01:43:07,486 --> 01:43:10,355
What's your name?
Can you hear me?

1132
01:43:10,399 --> 01:43:13,301
We'll get you out.

1133
01:43:13,343 --> 01:43:15,415
Her leg's stuck.

1134
01:43:42,910 --> 01:43:44,797
Easy! Easy!

1135
01:44:05,086 --> 01:44:07,606
Hang in there, champ.

1136
01:44:15,038 --> 01:44:17,078
What did they do to you?

1137
01:44:18,782 --> 01:44:22,197
Hang on, boy.

1138
01:44:22,238 --> 01:44:25,238
Good, you're very brave.

1139
01:44:25,278 --> 01:44:27,384
That's it, champ!

1140
01:44:29,150 --> 01:44:30,841
That's it, boy.

1141
01:45:54,110 --> 01:45:57,907
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Putting on my hood!

1142
01:45:57,950 --> 01:46:01,246
Why not wear a sign
saying "Bank Robber"?

1143
01:46:01,278 --> 01:46:02,969
For banks,
you don't wear anything!

1144
01:46:03,007 --> 01:46:05,428
What?
Just my stupid face?

1145
01:46:05,470 --> 01:46:07,259
You decide.

1146
01:46:13,598 --> 01:46:15,987
Hit the floor,
you motherfuckers!

1147
01:46:16,030 --> 01:46:17,819
This is a stickup!

1148
01:46:17,854 --> 01:46:19,742
This is a stickup,
assholes!

1149
01:46:19,774 --> 01:46:22,360
Everyone on the floor!

1150
01:46:24,350 --> 01:46:25,692
What are you looking at?

1151
01:46:25,726 --> 01:46:27,417
Right now!

1152
01:46:27,454 --> 01:46:30,105
On the floor!

1153
01:46:30,143 --> 01:46:32,532
You, too!
I'm talking to you!

1154
01:46:32,574 --> 01:46:35,574
- Give me your wallet!
- Take it yourself.

1155
01:46:35,614 --> 01:46:38,232
Don't look at me!

1156
01:46:38,270 --> 01:46:40,026
On the floor!

1157
01:46:49,502 --> 01:46:53,430
Don't move,
drop the gun!

1158
01:46:53,470 --> 01:46:54,899
Get down!

1159
01:47:07,678 --> 01:47:10,810
Easy...

1160
01:47:27,230 --> 01:47:28,921
Leave him alone.

1161
01:47:33,182 --> 01:47:34,459
Lobo, get lost.

1162
01:47:34,494 --> 01:47:36,796
Good boy. Very good.

1163
01:47:48,158 --> 01:47:50,012
It's healed.

1164
01:48:33,790 --> 01:48:35,862
What brings you here, Leo?

1165
01:48:35,902 --> 01:48:37,942
Just passing by.

1166
01:48:39,198 --> 01:48:42,613
You're taking your time.
It's been a week.

1167
01:48:42,654 --> 01:48:43,898
It's not easy.

1168
01:48:43,934 --> 01:48:45,909
It never is, is it?

1169
01:48:45,950 --> 01:48:51,133
Tell your friend to keep cool.
It'll be done in two days.

1170
01:48:51,166 --> 01:48:56,403
I've got your word, Chivo?
I've got to go to the bank.

1171
01:51:36,830 --> 01:51:39,219
I watched your car!

1172
01:51:39,262 --> 01:51:40,604
Sure...

1173
01:51:40,638 --> 01:51:44,282
I was leaning
on the car.

1174
01:51:44,317 --> 01:51:46,652
No, he went
to play soccer!

1175
01:51:47,966 --> 01:51:49,788
For both of you.

1176
01:52:15,678 --> 01:52:17,914
My condolences,
Doña Concha.

1177
01:52:36,254 --> 01:52:38,393
Are you all right?

1178
01:52:41,117 --> 01:52:43,387
Not as bad as I was.

1179
01:52:46,621 --> 01:52:48,661
Why did you leave?

1180
01:52:50,014 --> 01:52:52,501
Now's not the time
to talk about it.

1181
01:52:55,230 --> 01:52:57,052
Then when?

1182
01:53:24,925 --> 01:53:27,478
Ramiro was my husband,
wasn't he?

1183
01:53:27,518 --> 01:53:29,787
And what about our plans?

1184
01:53:29,821 --> 01:53:31,731
Your plans.

1185
01:53:31,774 --> 01:53:34,076
My grandmother used to say,

1186
01:53:34,110 --> 01:53:38,649
"To make God laugh,
tell Him your plans. "

1187
01:53:38,686 --> 01:53:42,679
- You wronged me, Susana.
- No, Octavio.

1188
01:53:42,718 --> 01:53:45,107
We were the ones
who cheated.

1189
01:53:45,150 --> 01:53:47,288
But not anymore.

1190
01:53:48,606 --> 01:53:50,745
Come away with me.

1191
01:53:50,782 --> 01:53:53,116
How dare you?

1192
01:53:53,150 --> 01:53:56,598
After everything
that's happened?

1193
01:53:59,614 --> 01:54:03,127
- You still don't get it!
- Yes, I do.

1194
01:54:03,165 --> 01:54:07,606
God can laugh,
but I still have my plans.

1195
01:54:08,862 --> 01:54:11,131
Sunday at 11:00,
I leave for Ciudad Juarez.

1196
01:54:11,166 --> 01:54:14,777
You've really lost it!
Look at you!

1197
01:54:14,814 --> 01:54:16,505
I don't give a fuck!

1198
01:54:18,877 --> 01:54:20,819
Now you know everything.

1199
01:54:22,462 --> 01:54:24,764
I'll wait for you.

1200
01:54:27,677 --> 01:54:31,060
You decide
if you want to come.

1201
01:54:31,102 --> 01:54:32,989
Do you get me now?

1202
01:54:34,462 --> 01:54:36,917
Ramiro...

1203
01:54:36,958 --> 01:54:40,057
the baby's name
will be Ramiro.

1204
01:54:59,038 --> 01:55:01,427
Feeling better?

1205
01:55:10,685 --> 01:55:12,180
What happened to you?

1206
01:55:39,550 --> 01:55:41,110
Flor?

1207
01:55:45,341 --> 01:55:46,967
Don't die on me!

1208
01:55:47,005 --> 01:55:49,591
Answer me, baby!

1209
01:55:54,173 --> 01:55:56,061
Frijol?

1210
01:56:24,893 --> 01:56:27,227
It's not right, asshole!

1211
01:56:48,222 --> 01:56:51,320
Gringuita?
My baby?

1212
01:56:56,510 --> 01:56:58,365
Hang in there.
Hang in there.

1213
02:00:12,285 --> 02:00:14,457
Look straight ahead of you.

1214
02:00:15,742 --> 02:00:17,465
Don't look at me.

1215
02:00:17,502 --> 02:00:20,633
Open the door.
No stupid moves.

1216
02:00:20,669 --> 02:00:23,898
- Don't turn around.
- Stay cool.

1217
02:00:27,901 --> 02:00:29,811
Move aside.

1218
02:00:33,118 --> 02:00:34,874
Cuff your left hand.

1219
02:00:35,965 --> 02:00:39,161
The right one to the wheel.

1220
02:00:39,197 --> 02:00:43,059
Cuff it to the wheel,
dickhead!

1221
02:00:45,246 --> 02:00:46,969
Start the car.

1222
02:00:52,957 --> 02:00:54,713
Let's go.

1223
02:00:57,693 --> 02:01:01,686
What is this?
Robbery or kidnapping?

1224
02:01:01,725 --> 02:01:04,856
Maybe the last day
of your life.

1225
02:01:07,582 --> 02:01:10,615
I was paid
to blow you away, brother.

1226
02:01:10,653 --> 02:01:12,377
How about that?

1227
02:01:19,357 --> 02:01:22,008
Stand still.
On your knees.

1228
02:01:23,485 --> 02:01:26,453
On the floor.
Your hand.

1229
02:01:28,381 --> 02:01:29,908
Sit.

1230
02:01:31,773 --> 02:01:34,424
Lean there.
Your hand, I said.

1231
02:01:46,942 --> 02:01:49,429
Want a drink?

1232
02:01:49,470 --> 02:01:52,503
I've got rum, water...

1233
02:01:52,541 --> 02:01:54,265
or milk.

1234
02:01:58,429 --> 02:02:01,778
- What will you do to me?
- What do you want?

1235
02:02:01,821 --> 02:02:05,170
Rum, water or milk?

1236
02:02:05,213 --> 02:02:07,701
My question
couldn't be clearer.

1237
02:02:09,245 --> 02:02:11,547
Look, asshole,

1238
02:02:11,581 --> 02:02:14,549
I'm offering you a drink.

1239
02:02:14,589 --> 02:02:17,338
If you had any sense,

1240
02:02:17,373 --> 02:02:19,228
even a little bit,

1241
02:02:19,261 --> 02:02:22,043
you'd realize
I'm not going to kill you

1242
02:02:22,077 --> 02:02:24,565
just now, dickhead.

1243
02:02:24,605 --> 02:02:25,882
Rum,

1244
02:02:25,917 --> 02:02:28,022
water or milk?

1245
02:02:29,886 --> 02:02:31,925
Water.

1246
02:02:43,549 --> 02:02:45,076
Cheers!

1247
02:02:47,229 --> 02:02:48,505
How do I drink it?

1248
02:02:48,541 --> 02:02:52,283
I'll be the waiter,
but not your nanny.

1249
02:02:55,069 --> 02:02:56,978
Who paid you to kill me?

1250
02:02:57,022 --> 02:02:58,844
Can't you guess?

1251
02:02:58,877 --> 02:03:00,252
No.

1252
02:03:00,285 --> 02:03:02,456
What if I told you
it was the chick

1253
02:03:02,493 --> 02:03:06,006
you fuck daily
in that motel?

1254
02:03:07,645 --> 02:03:09,205
Marta?

1255
02:03:12,349 --> 02:03:15,764
No.
It can't be.

1256
02:03:15,805 --> 02:03:18,969
Right. Not her.

1257
02:03:19,005 --> 02:03:21,241
Your wife.

1258
02:03:25,214 --> 02:03:27,515
My wife?

1259
02:03:29,181 --> 02:03:31,068
She knows about Marta?

1260
02:03:31,101 --> 02:03:33,851
I don't know.
Does she?

1261
02:03:35,869 --> 02:03:39,993
No, man.
It's not her, either.

1262
02:03:45,181 --> 02:03:47,385
Marta's husband?

1263
02:03:49,725 --> 02:03:52,889
She's married?
I'll be damned!

1264
02:03:52,925 --> 02:03:55,576
Shit, brother!

1265
02:03:55,613 --> 02:04:00,120
A lot of people
want to kill you.

1266
02:04:00,157 --> 02:04:03,004
You know what?

1267
02:04:03,037 --> 02:04:05,274
My dog's got no name.

1268
02:04:05,309 --> 02:04:09,717
I found him in the street.
What would you call him?

1269
02:04:11,325 --> 02:04:13,878
How about "Lost Dog"?

1270
02:04:13,917 --> 02:04:16,732
Some imagination!

1271
02:04:16,765 --> 02:04:19,154
You must be in advertising.

1272
02:04:19,197 --> 02:04:22,099
I was thinking, maybe Gustavo...

1273
02:04:22,141 --> 02:04:24,116
Gustavo?

1274
02:04:25,565 --> 02:04:27,834
Know any Gustavos?

1275
02:04:27,870 --> 02:04:30,455
My brother.

1276
02:04:30,493 --> 02:04:32,381
Gustavo Garfias.

1277
02:04:32,413 --> 02:04:35,992
Gustavo Miranda Garfias.

1278
02:04:38,077 --> 02:04:40,695
He's my half brother.

1279
02:04:40,733 --> 02:04:45,240
Abel, Abel!

1280
02:04:45,277 --> 02:04:50,580
What did you do to deserve
a brother like that?

1281
02:04:50,621 --> 02:04:53,042
He said he's your partner.

1282
02:04:55,549 --> 02:04:58,898
Partner and half-brother.

1283
02:05:00,733 --> 02:05:02,642
Was it him?

1284
02:05:02,685 --> 02:05:05,587
I don't know.
You tell me.

1285
02:05:09,213 --> 02:05:13,304
- How much?
- 5,000 pesos.

1286
02:05:13,341 --> 02:05:17,051
Only 5,000 fucking pesos!

1287
02:05:17,085 --> 02:05:20,881
And, tickets
to the Rolling Stones.

1288
02:05:20,925 --> 02:05:24,470
That son of a fucking bitch!

1289
02:05:24,509 --> 02:05:26,233
Why?
What did I do to him?

1290
02:05:26,269 --> 02:05:28,822
Says you're screwing him.

1291
02:05:28,861 --> 02:05:31,795
No fucking way!
He's my brother!

1292
02:05:31,837 --> 02:05:35,765
Easy, man.
That's what he says.

1293
02:05:38,077 --> 02:05:43,511
Quit yelling or I'll have
to fill you with lead.

1294
02:05:43,549 --> 02:05:47,161
So, what do we call him?

1295
02:05:49,949 --> 02:05:52,371
Who cares about
your fucking dog?

1296
02:05:52,413 --> 02:05:54,453
Don't be rude!

1297
02:05:54,493 --> 02:05:57,689
Masters take after
their dogs, you know.

1298
02:05:57,725 --> 02:06:00,823
And... how do I put it?

1299
02:06:00,861 --> 02:06:04,025
If it weren't for him,
you'd be dead.

1300
02:06:08,253 --> 02:06:10,774
Easy, easy.

1301
02:06:10,813 --> 02:06:13,202
I'll be in my room
watching TV.

1302
02:06:13,245 --> 02:06:18,842
If you need anything at all,
just shout.

1303
02:06:43,484 --> 02:06:45,459
Good morning.

1304
02:06:54,013 --> 02:06:55,355
What's up, brother?

1305
02:06:55,389 --> 02:06:57,844
Got a good night's sleep?

1306
02:07:10,557 --> 02:07:12,859
What manners!

1307
02:07:14,045 --> 02:07:15,987
What will you do to me?

1308
02:07:16,029 --> 02:07:19,509
I don't know.
I'm thinking.

1309
02:07:19,549 --> 02:07:24,732
If you let me go...
I'll make you rich.

1310
02:07:27,197 --> 02:07:30,874
Kill my brother, and I'll give you
anything you want.

1311
02:07:31,901 --> 02:07:34,421
I don't need anything.
Amazing, huh?

1312
02:07:36,253 --> 02:07:38,904
I have to go.
See you later.

1313
02:07:39,997 --> 02:07:42,779
I need to go
to the bathroom.

1314
02:07:42,813 --> 02:07:47,220
You already have.
Look at you!

1315
02:07:47,261 --> 02:07:49,682
You should have told me!

1316
02:07:51,325 --> 02:07:54,838
See you later.
Watch him for me.

1317
02:08:10,525 --> 02:08:13,340
# I saw her heading
to the table #

1318
02:08:13,372 --> 02:08:16,220
# With a tall walking
big black cat #

1319
02:08:17,373 --> 02:08:19,991
# Charlie said,
"I hope that you're able, boy #

1320
02:08:20,029 --> 02:08:23,226
# Well, I'm telling you,
she knows where it's at" #

1321
02:08:24,284 --> 02:08:27,154
# Suddenly
we heard the sirens #

1322
02:08:27,197 --> 02:08:30,645
# And everybody
started to run #

1323
02:08:30,685 --> 02:08:33,467
# Jumping under
doors and tables #

1324
02:08:33,501 --> 02:08:38,258
# Well, I heard somebody
shooting a gun #

1325
02:08:38,301 --> 02:08:41,596
# Well, the D. A.
Was pumping my left hand #

1326
02:08:41,629 --> 02:08:44,858
# And she was holding
my right #

1327
02:08:44,893 --> 02:08:46,868
# Well, I told her,
"Don't get scared #

1328
02:08:46,909 --> 02:08:48,600
# 'Cause you're gonna
be spared" #

1329
02:08:48,636 --> 02:08:51,865
# I've gotta be forgiven
if I wanna spend my livin' #

1330
02:08:51,901 --> 02:08:54,868
# With a long cool woman
in a black dress... #

1331
02:08:54,908 --> 02:08:57,778
- Hello?
- Got my money?

1332
02:08:59,069 --> 02:09:01,043
Did you notice?
He wasn't at work today.

1333
02:09:01,085 --> 02:09:02,972
Did you do it?

1334
02:09:03,005 --> 02:09:05,972
Bring the money to my place
in two hours.

1335
02:09:06,013 --> 02:09:08,501
Don't keep me waiting.

1336
02:09:09,821 --> 02:09:13,017
#... Had it all #

1337
02:09:13,053 --> 02:09:14,875
# Had it all... #

1338
02:09:22,717 --> 02:09:26,841
Did you lock it, brother?
Cars get stolen around here.

1339
02:09:26,877 --> 02:09:30,226
This won't be long,
will it?

1340
02:09:32,189 --> 02:09:34,044
Here's what we agreed to.

1341
02:09:37,148 --> 02:09:38,643
Come in.

1342
02:09:38,685 --> 02:09:41,718
- I'd better go.
- Come in.

1343
02:09:46,429 --> 02:09:48,338
What's the matter?

1344
02:09:48,381 --> 02:09:50,650
It's all there.

1345
02:09:50,684 --> 02:09:53,172
It's cool.
Come with me.

1346
02:09:59,389 --> 02:10:00,632
In here.

1347
02:10:15,517 --> 02:10:17,426
Have you two met?

1348
02:10:24,092 --> 02:10:27,060
This wasn't the deal.

1349
02:10:27,101 --> 02:10:28,857
What was the deal?

1350
02:10:28,892 --> 02:10:31,259
- You were going to...
- Going to what, brother?

1351
02:10:31,293 --> 02:10:32,754
What!?

1352
02:10:34,813 --> 02:10:37,747
- That was your job!
- "Job"?

1353
02:10:37,788 --> 02:10:40,952
I misunderstood.
You wanted him off the map?

1354
02:10:40,989 --> 02:10:43,127
Do it yourself.

1355
02:10:43,165 --> 02:10:45,947
He's all yours,
fucking Cain.

1356
02:10:47,293 --> 02:10:50,937
Kill him, you faggot,
he's all yours!

1357
02:10:52,925 --> 02:10:55,096
I paid you...

1358
02:10:55,133 --> 02:10:57,948
I paid you to do it.
That was the deal!

1359
02:10:57,981 --> 02:10:59,923
You're not going to?

1360
02:11:01,341 --> 02:11:06,491
You want me to?
Do I kill him?

1361
02:11:06,524 --> 02:11:09,753
Do I kill him?
Answer me!

1362
02:11:09,789 --> 02:11:11,698
Do I kill him?

1363
02:11:13,885 --> 02:11:16,154
Or do I kill you?

1364
02:11:17,148 --> 02:11:20,945
Do I kill him?
Do you really want me to?

1365
02:11:22,300 --> 02:11:24,188
Fucking faggot!

1366
02:11:57,789 --> 02:12:01,367
So, you coming
or staying?

1367
02:14:29,981 --> 02:14:32,250
Good morning.

1368
02:14:34,044 --> 02:14:36,248
Sleep well?

1369
02:14:37,565 --> 02:14:39,834
You must have a lot
to chat about.

1370
02:14:39,868 --> 02:14:44,178
Pity I can't stay,
it would be fascinating.

1371
02:14:47,740 --> 02:14:52,018
But as you might guess,
I have to leave town.

1372
02:14:52,061 --> 02:14:54,581
That's how it works.

1373
02:15:00,924 --> 02:15:03,063
Make yourselves at home.

1374
02:15:03,100 --> 02:15:06,712
I hope you'll work things out.

1375
02:15:09,916 --> 02:15:12,087
What are you looking at?

1376
02:15:17,948 --> 02:15:22,203
On the other hand,
if talking doesn't work,

1377
02:15:22,236 --> 02:15:25,618
I'll leave you this
to help settle things.

1378
02:15:25,661 --> 02:15:27,515
Okay?

1379
02:15:27,548 --> 02:15:30,548
I'll call to see
how things went.

1380
02:15:31,836 --> 02:15:34,421
Nice jacket.

1381
02:15:34,461 --> 02:15:38,934
There's milk and eggs in the fridge,
if you want breakfast.

1382
02:15:53,853 --> 02:15:56,187
You're dead,
you bastard!

1383
02:18:26,428 --> 02:18:30,323
Hello.
This is 55445850.

1384
02:18:30,364 --> 02:18:31,738
I can't take your call
right now,

1385
02:18:31,772 --> 02:18:34,325
but leave a message
and a number,

1386
02:18:34,364 --> 02:18:36,306
and I'll get back to you.
Thank you.

1387
02:19:07,996 --> 02:19:10,068
Maru...

1388
02:19:10,109 --> 02:19:12,280
my darling...

1389
02:19:14,492 --> 02:19:16,696
This is Martin.

1390
02:19:16,732 --> 02:19:19,449
Your dad...

1391
02:19:19,484 --> 02:19:22,332
your real dad.

1392
02:19:24,253 --> 02:19:27,962
You must think
this is a sick joke.

1393
02:19:27,996 --> 02:19:32,949
For all these years,
I've been dead to you.

1394
02:19:32,988 --> 02:19:38,455
In fact,
I'm a living ghost.

1395
02:19:44,061 --> 02:19:46,646
When I saw you last...

1396
02:19:46,684 --> 02:19:50,001
you were only two.

1397
02:19:50,044 --> 02:19:53,524
Since then,
not a day passes

1398
02:19:53,564 --> 02:19:56,662
that I don't think of you.

1399
02:19:56,700 --> 02:19:59,187
The afternoon I went away...

1400
02:20:02,780 --> 02:20:05,398
I held you very tight.

1401
02:20:07,772 --> 02:20:10,227
I took you in my arms...

1402
02:20:10,268 --> 02:20:13,683
I begged forgiveness
for what I was going to do.

1403
02:20:13,724 --> 02:20:16,091
At the time,

1404
02:20:16,124 --> 02:20:18,131
I thought there were
more important things

1405
02:20:18,172 --> 02:20:20,889
than being with you
and your mom.

1406
02:20:20,924 --> 02:20:24,023
I wanted to set
the world right,

1407
02:20:24,060 --> 02:20:27,027
and then share it with you.

1408
02:20:27,068 --> 02:20:30,264
I failed,
as you can see.

1409
02:20:32,604 --> 02:20:34,579
I wound up in jail.

1410
02:20:35,996 --> 02:20:40,219
Your mother and I agreed
she would tell you... I'd died.

1411
02:20:40,252 --> 02:20:44,146
That was my idea,
not hers.

1412
02:20:44,189 --> 02:20:47,484
I swore to her I'd never try
to see you again...

1413
02:20:47,516 --> 02:20:50,451
but I couldn't do it.

1414
02:20:56,796 --> 02:21:01,684
I was dying, I was as dead
as I could be.

1415
02:21:01,724 --> 02:21:05,302
I'll be back to find you...

1416
02:21:05,340 --> 02:21:09,050
once I have the courage
to look you in the eyes.

1417
02:21:10,364 --> 02:21:13,178
I love you,
my little girl.

1418
02:21:48,380 --> 02:21:50,235
What's your dog called?

1419
02:21:53,084 --> 02:21:55,418
Blackie.

1420
02:21:56,828 --> 02:21:58,584
Shut up, Blackie!

1421
02:21:58,620 --> 02:22:00,823
- See you around.
- Bye.

1422
02:22:57,852 --> 02:23:02,042
For Luciano, because we are also
what we have lost.

1423

# A giants' joust turns the air
into natural gas #

1429

# Tell me everything's a lie #

1430
02:25:04,412 --> 02:25:07,030
# Just a silly dream
and nothing more #

1431
02:25:07,068 --> 02:25:09,970
# I'm afraid of enormity #

1432
02:25:10,011 --> 02:25:13,492
# Where nobody
hears my voice #

1433
02:25:16,540 --> 02:25:18,711
# Stop the deception #

1434
02:25:18,748 --> 02:25:22,229

somebody else here? #

1439
