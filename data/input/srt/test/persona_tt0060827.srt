1
00:06:44,814 --> 00:06:49,644
- You wanted to see me, Doctor?
- Have you seen Mrs Vogler, Sister?

2
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:52,907
- No, not yet.
- Then l'll fill you in...

3
00:06:53,076 --> 00:06:57,575
...and give you the reasons
why you're to care for her.

4
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:03,874
Mrs Vogler is an actress, as you know,
and was performing in Electra,

5
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:08,300
ln the middle of the play she fell silent
and looked around as if in surprise.

6
00:07:08,474 --> 00:07:11,560
She remained quiet for a minute.

7
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:29,796
Afterwards she excused herself by
saying she was overcome by laughter.

8
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:34,676
The next day the theatre rang and
asked if she'd forgotten her rehearsal.

9
00:07:34,847 --> 00:07:38,384
When the housekeeper went in
she was still in bed.

10
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:43,059
She was awake but didn't
answer questions and didn't move.

11
00:07:43,235 --> 00:07:48,824
She's been like this for three months
and been given every conceivable test.

12
00:07:48,993 --> 00:07:54,500
The result is clear. She's perfectly
healthy, both mentally and physically.

13
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:58,585
lt's not even a question
of some kind of hysterical reaction.

14
00:07:58,758 --> 00:08:01,380
Any questions, Sister Alma?

15
00:08:01,554 --> 00:08:05,387
No? Then you can go in to Mrs Vogler.

16
00:08:13,446 --> 00:08:18,906
Good day, Mrs Vogler.
My name is Sister Alma.

17
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,830
l've been employed
to look after you for a while.

18
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:30,637
Perhaps l should tell you about myself.
l'm 25, engaged...

19
00:08:30,806 --> 00:08:34,757
l got my nursing certificate
two years ago.

20
00:08:34,937 --> 00:08:40,812
My parents have a farm. My mother
was also a nurse before she married.

21
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:45,151
l'll fetch the dinner tray.

22
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:49,327
lt's fried liver and fruit salad.
lt looks really good.

23
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:54,256
Do you want to raise your head?
ls it okay like that?

24
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:05,105
Sister Alma.
What's your first impression?

25
00:09:05,274 --> 00:09:08,193
l don't know what to say, Doctor.

26
00:09:08,362 --> 00:09:14,569
First her face looks soft, almost
childish. Then you see her eyes...

27
00:09:14,746 --> 00:09:17,998
She's got such a severe look, l think.

28
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:22,500
- l don't know, l should...
- What were you thinking?

29
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:27,553
- l thought l should refuse the job.
- Did something frighten you?

30
00:09:27,724 --> 00:09:33,979
No, but she should have a nurse
who's older and more experienced.

31
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:38,980
- Experienced in life. l may not cope.
- Cope?

32
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:41,365
Mentally.

33
00:09:42,454 --> 00:09:46,917
lf Mrs Vogler's silence and immobility
is the result of a decision...

34
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,291
- ...it must be as she's seen as healthy.
- Well?

35
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:56,092
lt's a decision that shows great mental
strength. Perhaps l'm not up to it.

36
00:09:58,061 --> 00:10:02,524
You might like to see the dusk,
Mrs Vogler. l can draw them later.

37
00:10:05,697 --> 00:10:09,779
Shall l turn on the radio?
There's a play, l think.

38
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:17,833
Forgive me, my darling,
Oh, you must forgive me,

39
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:22,221
l don't desire anything other
than your forgiveness,

40
00:10:23,432 --> 00:10:28,143
What are you laughing at, Mrs Vogler?
ls it the actress that's funny?

41
00:10:28,314 --> 00:10:33,691
What do you know about compassion?
What do you know?

42
00:10:33,864 --> 00:10:36,701
What do you know about compassion?

43
00:10:41,376 --> 00:10:45,209
l don't understand things like that,
Mrs Vogler.

44
00:10:45,382 --> 00:10:50,093
l'm interested in film and theatre,
but l go so seldom.

45
00:10:50,264 --> 00:10:53,884
l have enormous admiration
for artists.

46
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:58,143
l think art
has an enormous importance in life.

47
00:10:58,318 --> 00:11:03,563
Especially for people
who have problems of some kind.

48
00:11:03,742 --> 00:11:08,656
l shouldn't talk to you about things
like that. l'm skating on thin ice.

49
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:12,121
l'll see if l can find some music.

50
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,207
ls that good?

51
00:11:16,804 --> 00:11:19,889
Good night, Mrs Vogler. Sleep well.

52
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:12,634
Damn!

53
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:25,988
lt's strange.
You go around almost any old how.

54
00:13:26,163 --> 00:13:30,080
Do almost any old thing.

55
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,887
l'll marry Karl-Henrik and we'll
have a few children that l'll raise.

56
00:13:38,098 --> 00:13:41,848
All that is decided. lt's inside of me.

57
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,557
lt's nothing to ponder over.

58
00:13:45,734 --> 00:13:48,939
lt's a huge feeling of security.

59
00:13:49,114 --> 00:13:53,363
Then l have a job that l like
and am happy with.

60
00:13:53,538 --> 00:13:57,703
That's good too. But in another way.

61
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,131
But it's good... good.

62
00:14:04,638 --> 00:14:06,465
lt's good.

63
00:14:13,693 --> 00:14:17,443
l wonder what's really wrong with her?

64
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,280
Elisabet Vogler...

65
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,784
Elisabet.

66
00:16:03,023 --> 00:16:06,725
Would you like me to open the letter,
Mrs Vogler?

67
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,073
Shall l read it?

68
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:23,167
Shall l read it to you?

69
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:36,983
''Dear Elisabet: As l'm not allowed
to see you, l'm writing.''

70
00:16:37,157 --> 00:16:41,406
''lf you don't want to read my letter,
you can ignore it.''

71
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:47,628
''l can't help seeking
this contact with you'' -

72
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:51,382
- ''as l'm tormented
by a constant question:''

73
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:57,809
''Have l harmed you in some way?
Have l hurt you without knowing?''

74
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,774
''Has some terrible misunderstanding
arisen between us?''

75
00:17:08,162 --> 00:17:10,868
Should l really read any more?

76
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:24,934
''As far as l understood, we were
happy recently. We've never been...''

77
00:17:25,104 --> 00:17:28,439
''...as close to one another.''

78
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:35,867
''Do you remember saying: Now
l understand what marriage means?''

79
00:17:36,037 --> 00:17:41,626
''You have taught me...''
l can't see what's written here.

80
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:44,881
''You have taught...'' Now l see...

81
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:51,637
''You've taught me that we must see
each other as two anxious children'' -

82
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,810
- ''filled with good will
and the best intentions.''

83
00:17:55,983 --> 00:17:58,902
''But gov...''

84
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:05,278
Now l see it. ''But governed by forces
we only partially control.''

85
00:18:05,456 --> 00:18:09,076
''Do you remember saying all of that?''

86
00:18:09,253 --> 00:18:14,879
''We were walking in the woods
and you stopped and held my belt...''

87
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,774
There was a photograph
with the letter as well.

88
00:18:26,946 --> 00:18:31,409
lt's a photograph of your son.
l don't know if...

89
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:35,280
Would you like it, Mrs Vogler?

90
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:38,247
He looks awfully sweet.

91
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:15,719
l've been thinking, Elisabet. l don't
think you should remain at the hospital.

92
00:19:15,894 --> 00:19:19,894
l think it's harmful.
As you don't want to go home -

93
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:25,194
- you and Sister Alma can move out
to my summer place by the sea. Hmm?

94
00:19:26,702 --> 00:19:32,458
Don't you think l understand?
The hopeless dream of being.

95
00:19:32,627 --> 00:19:35,120
Not seeming, but being.

96
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:41,430
Consious at every moment. Vigilant.

97
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:47,554
At the same time the chasm between
what you are to others and to yourself.

98
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:53,442
The feeling of vertigo and the constant
desire to at last be exposed.

99
00:19:54,535 --> 00:20:00,908
To be seen through, cut down,
perhaps even annihilated.

100
00:20:02,297 --> 00:20:08,884
Every tone of voice a lie, every gesture
a falsehood, every smile a grimace.

101
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:12,891
Commit suicide? Oh, no.

102
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,527
That's ugly. You don't do that.

103
00:20:17,695 --> 00:20:23,617
But you can be immobile, you can
fall silent. Then at least you don't lie.

104
00:20:23,787 --> 00:20:27,205
You can close yourself in,
shut yourself off.

105
00:20:27,376 --> 00:20:32,336
Then you don't have to play roles,
show any faces or make false gestures.

106
00:20:32,508 --> 00:20:34,716
You think...

107
00:20:35,805 --> 00:20:40,849
But you see, reality is bloody-minded.
Your hideout isn't watertight.

108
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:44,606
Life seeps in everything.

109
00:20:47,322 --> 00:20:49,731
You're forced to react.

110
00:20:50,661 --> 00:20:56,536
No one asks if it's real or unreal,
if you're true or false.

111
00:20:56,711 --> 00:21:02,088
lt's only in the theatre the question
carries weight. Hardly even there.

112
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:08,852
l understand you, Elisabet. l understand
you're keeping silent, you're immobile.

113
00:21:09,021 --> 00:21:13,899
That you've placed this lack of will
into a fantastic system.

114
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:17,607
l understand and admire you.

115
00:21:17,784 --> 00:21:22,413
l think you should maintain this role
until it's played out.

116
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:26,500
Until it's no longer interesting.
Then you can leave it.

117
00:21:26,673 --> 00:21:32,096
Just as you bit by bit
leave all your other roles.

118
00:21:35,937 --> 00:21:41,610
rs Mogler and Sister Alma moved out
to the doctor's house in late summer,

119
00:21:41,737 --> 00:21:46,235
The sojourn near the sea
had a favourable effect on the actress,

120
00:21:46,411 --> 00:21:50,991
The apathy that had crippled her
in hospital yields to long walks -

121
00:21:51,168 --> 00:21:55,832
- fishing trips, cooking,
letter writing and other diversions,

122
00:21:56,008 --> 00:22:01,800
Sister Alma enjoys her rural seclusion
and takes utmost care of her patient,

123
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:48,085
Don't you know it's bad luck
to compare hands?

124
00:23:05,863 --> 00:23:10,907
Elisabet? Can l read you something
from my book?

125
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:14,200
Or am l disturbing you? lt says here:

126
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:18,956
''All the anxiety we bear with us,
all our thwarted dreams'' -

127
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:23,713
- ''the incomprehensible cruelty,
our fear of extinction'' -

128
00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:26,927
- ''the painful insight
into our earthly condition'' -

129
00:23:27,103 --> 00:23:33,191
- ''have slowly eroded our hope
of an other-wordly salvation.''

130
00:23:33,737 --> 00:23:38,402
''The howl of our faith and doubt
against the darkness and silence'' -

131
00:23:38,578 --> 00:23:42,578
- ''is one of the most awful proofs
of our abandonment'' -

132
00:23:42,751 --> 00:23:46,965
- ''and our terrified,
unuttered knowledge.''

133
00:23:48,092 --> 00:23:51,095
Do you think it's like that?

134
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:56,476
l don't believe it.

135
00:23:57,523 --> 00:24:01,772
Making changes...
The worst thing with me is l'm so lazy.

136
00:24:01,946 --> 00:24:06,445
And then l get a bad conscience. Karl-
Henrik scolds me for lacking ambition.

137
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,750
He says l go around like a sleepwalker.
l think that's unfair.

138
00:24:10,918 --> 00:24:16,591
l was best in my group with the exams.
But he probably means something else.

139
00:24:18,471 --> 00:24:20,180
You know...

140
00:24:20,349 --> 00:24:24,348
Oh, sorry. You know
what l sometimes think of?

141
00:24:24,522 --> 00:24:29,269
At the hospital where l did my exam,
there's a home for old nurses.

142
00:24:29,446 --> 00:24:35,285
Ones that have always been nurses,
lived for their work. Always in uniform.

143
00:24:35,455 --> 00:24:41,460
They live in their small rooms. lmagine
devoting your whole life to something.

144
00:24:41,631 --> 00:24:45,677
l mean, believing in something.
Accomplishing something.

145
00:24:45,845 --> 00:24:50,806
Believing that one's life has a purpose.
l like things like that.

146
00:24:50,978 --> 00:24:55,060
Sticking to one thing doggedly,
irrespective. l think one ought to.

147
00:24:56,236 --> 00:25:01,315
Mean something to other people.
Don't you think so as well?

148
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:08,952
l know it sounds childish,
but l believe in it.

149
00:25:10,632 --> 00:25:13,837
Goodness, it's raining a lot!

150
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:19,639
Oh, yes. He was married.
We had a relationship for five years.

151
00:25:19,813 --> 00:25:22,768
Then he got tired, of course.

152
00:25:22,942 --> 00:25:26,776
l was very much in love, that's for sure.
And he was the first.

153
00:25:26,948 --> 00:25:30,485
l remember it all like a long torment.

154
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:36,292
Long periods of pain
and then short moments when...

155
00:25:36,462 --> 00:25:42,301
l'm thinking of it as you've taught me
to smoke. He smoked loads.

156
00:25:42,471 --> 00:25:47,432
Thinking of it afterwards,
it's really banal. A real pulp fiction.

157
00:25:49,023 --> 00:25:53,319
ln a strange way
it was never really real.

158
00:25:53,488 --> 00:25:59,410
l don't know how to describe it.
At least, l was never quite real to him.

159
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:05,003
My pain was real, that's for sure.

160
00:26:05,172 --> 00:26:10,465
Somehow it was is if it was part of it
in some nasty way.

161
00:26:10,638 --> 00:26:14,009
As if that's how it was supposed to be.

162
00:26:14,185 --> 00:26:18,185
Even the things we said to each other...

163
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:29,076
Many people have told me that
l'm a good listener. Funny, huh?

164
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:34,876
No one's ever bothered to listen to me.
Like you are now. You're listening.

165
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:38,836
l think you're the first person
who's listened to me.

166
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:43,595
lt can't be interesting at all.
You could read a good book instead.

167
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:47,189
God, l'm going on.
You're not getting irritated?

168
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,813
lt's so nice to talk.
lt feels so nice and warm.

169
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:54,693
l feel like l've never felt
in my whole life.

170
00:26:56,707 --> 00:27:01,206
l always wanted a sister.
l only have a load of brothers. Seven.

171
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:06,758
Funny, huh? Then l come along. l've
been surrounded by boys all my life.

172
00:27:08,058 --> 00:27:14,977
l like boys. But you would know that
with all your experience as an actress.

173
00:27:16,195 --> 00:27:22,201
l really like Karl-Henrik.
But, you know, you only love once.

174
00:27:22,371 --> 00:27:27,913
l'm faithful to him. ln my profession
there are opportunities, l can tell you.

175
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:35,506
Karl-Henrik and l had hired
a cottage by the sea.

176
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,269
lt was June, we were all alone.

177
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:45,353
One day when Karl-Henrik had gone
into town, l went to the beach alone.

178
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:49,744
lt was really nice and warm.

179
00:27:49,912 --> 00:27:53,614
There was another girl there.
She lived on an island nearby -

180
00:27:53,751 --> 00:27:59,258
- but had come over as our beach lay
to the south and was more relaxed.

181
00:28:00,594 --> 00:28:04,926
So we lay beside one another
completely naked and sunbathed.

182
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:10,139
We slept a little, woke up,
and put on some oil.

183
00:28:10,275 --> 00:28:15,355
We wore these hats on our heads,
you know, those cheap straw hats.

184
00:28:15,492 --> 00:28:18,993
l had a blue ribbon around my hat.

185
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:24,244
l lay looking out from under the hat -

186
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:28,593
- glanced out at the landscape,
the sea and the sun.

187
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,927
lt was so curious.

188
00:28:36,523 --> 00:28:41,650
Suddenly l saw two figures jumping
about on the rocks above us.

189
00:28:42,741 --> 00:28:46,361
They hid and peeped out
occasionally.

190
00:28:46,496 --> 00:28:52,538
''There are two boys looking at us'',
l said to her. Her name was Katarina.

191
00:28:52,672 --> 00:28:56,672
''Well, let them look'', she said,
and turned on her back.

192
00:28:58,055 --> 00:29:01,141
lt was such a strange feeling.

193
00:29:01,268 --> 00:29:06,016
l wanted to run and put on
my costume, but l just lay still...

194
00:29:06,151 --> 00:29:12,607
On my belly with my bum in the air,
totally unembarrassed, totally calm.

195
00:29:15,206 --> 00:29:21,662
All the time l had Katarina beside me
with her breasts and thick thighs.

196
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:26,048
She just lay there
giggling a little to herself.

197
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:33,768
Then l saw the boys had come nearer.
They just stood looking at us.

198
00:29:34,651 --> 00:29:38,603
l saw that they were terribly young.

199
00:29:38,741 --> 00:29:43,619
Then one of them, the bravest one -

200
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:47,997
- he came up to us
and squatted down beside Katarina.

201
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:54,302
He pretended to be busy with his foot
and sat poking between his toes.

202
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:58,181
l felt totally strange.

203
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:03,019
Suddenly l heard Katarina say:

204
00:30:03,152 --> 00:30:07,484
''Aren't you going
to come over here?''

205
00:30:07,617 --> 00:30:11,997
Then she took his hand and helped
him take his jeans and shirt off.

206
00:30:12,124 --> 00:30:18,415
Suddenly he was over her and she
helped him in and held his behind.

207
00:30:20,303 --> 00:30:24,552
The other boy just sat on the slope
and watched.

208
00:30:24,685 --> 00:30:29,598
l heard Katarina whisper in his ear
and laugh.

209
00:30:29,734 --> 00:30:33,354
l had his face right next to me.

210
00:30:33,489 --> 00:30:37,192
lt was all red and swollen.

211
00:30:39,081 --> 00:30:43,544
Suddenly l turned over and said,
''Aren't you going to come to me too?''

212
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:50,471
Katarina said, ''Go to her now''.
And he pulled out of her and...

213
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:55,346
...he fell over me, completely hard.
He took hold of one breast.

214
00:30:55,481 --> 00:30:59,611
God, it hurt so much...

215
00:30:59,737 --> 00:31:04,864
l was all ready somehow, l came
at once. Can you understand that?

216
00:31:04,995 --> 00:31:09,624
l was just going to tell him, ''Be careful
so that l don't get pregnant'' -

217
00:31:09,752 --> 00:31:12,790
- when he came. l felt...

218
00:31:12,923 --> 00:31:18,549
l felt it like l'd never felt it before
how he sprayed his seed into me.

219
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:25,148
He gripped my shoulders and bent
backwards. l came over and over.

220
00:31:28,446 --> 00:31:33,194
Katarina lay on her side looking
and she held him from behind.

221
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:41,547
When he came she embraced him
and made herself come with his hand.

222
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:46,681
And when she came she screamed
really loud.

223
00:31:52,608 --> 00:31:55,943
Then all three of us started laughing.

224
00:31:56,071 --> 00:32:00,616
We called the other boy sitting
on the slope. His name was Peter.

225
00:32:05,794 --> 00:32:10,339
He came down all confused,
looking frozen in the sunshine.

226
00:32:13,013 --> 00:32:17,927
Katarina unbuttoned his trousers
and started playing with him.

227
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:21,433
When he came
she took him in her mouth.

228
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:25,904
He bent down and started kissing her
on the back.

229
00:32:26,032 --> 00:32:30,447
She turned around, took his head in
both hands and gave him her breast.

230
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:34,711
The other boy got so excited,
so he and l started again.

231
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:39,170
lt was as nice as the first time.

232
00:32:41,097 --> 00:32:46,805
Then we swam and parted. When l
came back, Karl-Henrik had returned.

233
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:55,196
We ate dinner together and drank
the red wine he had with him.

234
00:32:56,536 --> 00:32:59,574
Then we slept together.

235
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:04,953
lt's never been as good, before or since.
Can you understand that?

236
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:09,799
Then l fell pregnant, of course.

237
00:33:09,931 --> 00:33:14,845
Karl-Henrik, who's studying medicine,
took me to a friend who aborted it.

238
00:33:16,358 --> 00:33:20,689
We were both happy.
We didn't want any children.

239
00:33:20,823 --> 00:33:24,240
Not just then, anyway.

240
00:33:29,586 --> 00:33:35,757
lt doesn't make sense.
None of it fits together.

241
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:41,436
Then you get a bad conscience over
small things. Can you understand?

242
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:47,437
What happens to everything
you believe in? lsn't it necessary?

243
00:33:49,282 --> 00:33:54,575
Can you be one and the same person
at the same time?

244
00:33:54,707 --> 00:33:59,003
l mean, was l two people...?
God, l'm being silly...

245
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:03,461
l don't have any reason
to start snivelling, anyway.

246
00:34:03,595 --> 00:34:06,882
Wait, l'm going to fetch a tissue.

247
00:34:27,547 --> 00:34:32,841
lt's nearly morning...
and it's still raining.

248
00:34:39,482 --> 00:34:44,823
lmagine, l've been talking in a stream.
l've talked and you've listened to me.

249
00:34:44,948 --> 00:34:50,194
How boring for you. Of what interest
can my life be to you?

250
00:34:50,331 --> 00:34:52,788
One should be like you.

251
00:34:54,129 --> 00:34:58,793
You know what l thought
when l saw your film that night?

252
00:34:58,927 --> 00:35:04,885
When l came home l saw myself
in the mirror and thought: we're alike.

253
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:09,269
Don't misunderstand me, you're much
prettier, but we are alike in a way.

254
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:14,232
l think l could turn myself into you.
lf l made a real effort.

255
00:35:14,367 --> 00:35:16,408
l mean inside.

256
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:22,585
You could turn yourself into me
just like that.

257
00:35:22,713 --> 00:35:28,006
Although your soul would be much
too big. lt would stick out everywhere!

258
00:35:31,226 --> 00:35:36,186
You should go to bed now. Otherwise
you'll fall asleep at the table.

259
00:35:49,586 --> 00:35:54,547
No, l must go to bed.
Otherwise l'll fall asleep at the table.

260
00:35:54,677 --> 00:35:58,130
That would be
a little too uncomfortable.

261
00:36:00,812 --> 00:36:02,686
Good night.

262
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:05,036
Listen, Elisabet...

263
00:39:07,424 --> 00:39:10,675
Did you speak to me last night?

264
00:39:41,266 --> 00:39:44,387
Were you in my room last night?

265
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:29,455
Shall l take your mail as well?

266
00:40:30,297 --> 00:40:32,255
Can l have a taste?

267
00:40:34,053 --> 00:40:36,094
Bye.

268
00:41:42,447 --> 00:41:47,407
My dear: l'd always like to live
like this. This silence, living cut off -

269
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:52,582
- this feeling of the battered soul
finally beginning to straighten out.

270
00:41:57,803 --> 00:42:01,138
Alma's spoiling me
in the most moving manner.

271
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:08,777
l think, by the way, that she's enjoying
herself and is quite taken with me -

272
00:42:08,903 --> 00:42:15,075
- even smitten in an unconscious and
delightful way. lt's fun studying her.

273
00:42:24,384 --> 00:42:27,340
Sometimes she cries over past sins -

274
00:42:27,514 --> 00:42:31,644
- an episodic orgy with a totally
strange boy followed by an abortion.

275
00:42:31,812 --> 00:42:36,358
She complains that her notions of life
don't accord with her actions.

276
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:27,088
l see you're reading a play? That's
a healthy sign, l'll tell the doctor.

277
00:48:30,264 --> 00:48:35,142
Don't you think we should leave soon?
l'm starting to miss town.

278
00:48:35,272 --> 00:48:38,440
Aren't you?

279
00:48:52,756 --> 00:48:55,842
Would you like to make me
really happy?

280
00:48:56,512 --> 00:49:01,010
l know it's a sacrifice,
but l need your help right now.

281
00:49:01,144 --> 00:49:05,607
lt's nothing dangerous.
But l want you to talk to me.

282
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:11,442
Doesn't have to be special.
Anything, what we're having for dinner -

283
00:49:11,576 --> 00:49:16,869
- or if you think the water's cold after
the storm. lf it's too cold to swim.

284
00:49:17,001 --> 00:49:20,087
We only need to talk a few minutes.
One minute.

285
00:49:20,214 --> 00:49:24,712
You can read from your book.
Just say a few words.

286
00:49:25,805 --> 00:49:31,479
l must try not to get angry. You
remain silent and that's your business.

287
00:49:31,606 --> 00:49:35,226
But now l need you to talk to me.

288
00:49:37,281 --> 00:49:41,150
My dear woman,
can't you say just a single word?

289
00:49:43,415 --> 00:49:49,124
l knew you'd refuse.
You can't know how l feel.

290
00:49:50,467 --> 00:49:56,390
l always thought great artists felt
great compassion for other people.

291
00:49:56,518 --> 00:50:01,597
That they created from a sense of
great sympathy and a need to help.

292
00:50:01,734 --> 00:50:04,606
That was stupid of me.

293
00:50:07,409 --> 00:50:12,952
You've used me. Now that you don't
need me you just throw me away.

294
00:50:13,836 --> 00:50:17,787
Yes, l hear very well how it sounds,
how false it sounds!

295
00:50:17,925 --> 00:50:21,877
You've used me, now you're
discarding me. Every word!

296
00:50:22,014 --> 00:50:24,304
And then these glasses!

297
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:37,658
You've really hurt me. You've
laughed at me behind my back.

298
00:50:39,582 --> 00:50:42,288
l read the letter you sent to the doctor.

299
00:50:42,462 --> 00:50:47,459
Just think, it wasn't sealed!
And l read it thoroughly!

300
00:50:48,554 --> 00:50:53,265
You got me to talk. You got me to
tell you things l've never told anyone.

301
00:50:53,395 --> 00:50:57,691
And you hand it on.
What a study, huh?! You're not...

302
00:50:58,569 --> 00:51:03,862
You're going to talk now! lf you've got
anything to say, you're bloody well...

303
00:51:17,264 --> 00:51:20,183
No, stop it!

304
00:51:30,617 --> 00:51:33,405
You were really scared now, huh?

305
00:51:35,124 --> 00:51:39,455
For a second you were
genuinely scared, not so?

306
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:45,215
A genuine fear of death, huh?
Alma's gone crazy, you thought.

307
00:51:45,347 --> 00:51:48,727
What kind of person are you, really?

308
00:51:48,727 --> 00:51:52,478
Or do you think like this:
l'll remember that face.

309
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:58,358
That tone of voice, that expression. l'll
give you something you won't forget!

310
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:23,310
You're laughing, are you?

311
00:52:23,446 --> 00:52:29,119
lt's not so simple for me.
Not so funny, either.

312
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:32,451
But you've always got your laugh.

313
00:53:57,002 --> 00:54:00,539
Must it be like this?

314
00:54:01,968 --> 00:54:06,015
ls it really important not to lie,
to speak the truth -

315
00:54:06,141 --> 00:54:09,511
- to talk with a genuine tone of voice?

316
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:13,017
Can one live at all
without talking freely?

317
00:54:13,151 --> 00:54:18,397
Lie and deviate and evade things.

318
00:54:18,534 --> 00:54:23,994
lsn't it better to allow yourself
to be lazy and sloppy, untruthful?

319
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:31,088
Maybe you become a little better if
you just let yourself be what you are.

320
00:54:33,849 --> 00:54:38,264
No, you don't understand. You don't
understand what l'm saying.

321
00:54:38,397 --> 00:54:40,854
You are inaccessible.

322
00:54:40,985 --> 00:54:45,067
They said you were mentally healthy,
but your madness is the worst.

323
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:49,579
You're acting healthy. You do it
so well everyone believes you.

324
00:54:49,706 --> 00:54:53,836
Everyone except me,
because l know how rotten you are.

325
00:54:59,345 --> 00:55:01,220
What am l doing?

326
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,849
Elisabet! Elisabet, forgive me.

327
00:55:06,982 --> 00:55:10,518
l behaved like an idiot,
don't know what got into me.

328
00:55:10,654 --> 00:55:15,614
l'm here to help you.
Then there was that awful letter.

329
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:20,658
l was so disappointed.
You asked me to talk about myself.

330
00:55:21,545 --> 00:55:25,592
lt was nice, you looked so understanding,
l'd drunk a lot...

331
00:55:25,718 --> 00:55:29,255
lt was so nice to talk about it all.

332
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:35,099
l was also flattered that a great actress
cared to listen to me.

333
00:55:35,232 --> 00:55:40,360
Somehow l thought it would be nice
if it was of some use to you.

334
00:55:40,532 --> 00:55:44,484
But it's terrible, isn't it?
Sheer exhibitionism.

335
00:55:44,621 --> 00:55:47,577
Elisabet, l want you to forgive me.

336
00:55:47,709 --> 00:55:50,914
l like you so much,
you mean so much to me.

337
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:54,964
l've learned so much from you,
l don't want to part as enemies.

338
00:56:18,004 --> 00:56:22,051
You don't want to forgive me.
You're too proud!

339
00:56:22,177 --> 00:56:25,880
You won't lower yourself
because you don't need to!

340
00:56:26,016 --> 00:56:29,719
l won't, l won't...!

341
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:39,560
We don't talk,,, don't listen,,,
understand,,,

342
01:00:43,443 --> 01:00:48,736
- Elisabet?
- What means should,,, to enable,,,

343
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:36,802
When you sleep your face is slack.

344
01:01:38,775 --> 01:01:42,691
Your mouth is swollen and ugly.

345
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:48,949
You have a nasty wrinkle
on your forehead.

346
01:01:55,508 --> 01:01:59,128
You smell of sleep and tears.

347
01:02:02,143 --> 01:02:06,060
l can see the pulse on your throat.

348
01:02:06,191 --> 01:02:10,321
You have a scar you normally cover
with make-up.

349
01:02:12,409 --> 01:02:14,449
Elisabet!

350
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:17,952
He's calling again.

351
01:02:19,044 --> 01:02:22,165
l'll find out what he wants from us.

352
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:26,126
Out here, far away in our loneliness.

353
01:02:48,379 --> 01:02:50,088
Elisabet?

354
01:02:50,966 --> 01:02:54,918
Elisabet? Sorry if l frightened you.

355
01:02:56,015 --> 01:03:00,976
- l'm not Elisabet.
- l don't have any demands.

356
01:03:01,106 --> 01:03:05,605
l didn't want to disturb you.
Don't you think l understand?

357
01:03:05,738 --> 01:03:09,738
The doctor explained
a number of things to me.

358
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:15,543
The most difficult thing is explaining
to the little boy. l'm doing my best.

359
01:03:17,297 --> 01:03:22,377
There is something that lies deeper,
that is hard to catch sight of.

360
01:03:22,513 --> 01:03:27,059
You love someone, or more correctly,
say you love someone, it's...

361
01:03:27,187 --> 01:03:32,350
lt's understandable.
Tangible as words are, that is.

362
01:03:32,487 --> 01:03:36,023
Mr Vogler, l'm not your wife.

363
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:40,989
You are also loved.
You build a little fellowship.

364
01:03:41,125 --> 01:03:46,963
lt generates security. You see
the possibility of enduring, not so?

365
01:03:49,095 --> 01:03:55,183
How can l say everything l've thought
without losing my way, boring you?

366
01:04:03,658 --> 01:04:07,705
l love you, as much as l did before.

367
01:04:14,299 --> 01:04:19,462
No, don't be so anxious, my darling.
We have one another.

368
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:22,767
We have faith,
know each other's thoughts.

369
01:04:22,895 --> 01:04:26,765
We love one another.
lt's true isn't it?

370
01:04:26,901 --> 01:04:31,400
lt's the effort that's most important,
not what we achieve. lsn't it?

371
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:38,867
To see each other as children.
Tormented, helpless, lonely children.

372
01:04:39,003 --> 01:04:44,711
- Elisabet.
- Tell the boy that l'm coming soon.

373
01:04:44,845 --> 01:04:48,796
Mummy's been sick,
but she's longing for her little boy.

374
01:04:48,934 --> 01:04:54,179
Remember to buy a present for him.
From Mummy, don't forget.

375
01:04:54,317 --> 01:04:58,233
You know l feel
such tenderness for you.

376
01:05:00,743 --> 01:05:03,829
lt's difficult to bear.

377
01:05:04,374 --> 01:05:08,456
l don't know what to do
with my tenderness.

378
01:05:09,131 --> 01:05:11,802
l live from your tenderness.

379
01:05:13,262 --> 01:05:18,555
Elisabet, do you like being with me?
ls it nice?

380
01:05:21,191 --> 01:05:26,151
- You're a wonderful lover. You know.
- My darling...

381
01:05:28,076 --> 01:05:31,945
Anaethetise me... throw me away!

382
01:05:32,082 --> 01:05:35,168
No, l can't, l can't take any more!

383
01:05:35,295 --> 01:05:39,461
Leave me alone!
lt's shame, it's all shame!

384
01:05:39,593 --> 01:05:44,637
Leave me alone!
l'm cold and rotten and indifferent!

385
01:05:44,768 --> 01:05:48,601
lt's all just lies and imitation,
all of it!

386
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:58,861
Elisabet, what have you got there?

387
01:05:59,707 --> 01:06:04,003
What are you hiding
under your hand? Let me see.

388
01:06:07,218 --> 01:06:11,514
lt's the photo of your little boy.
The one you tore up.

389
01:06:11,641 --> 01:06:13,848
We must talk about that.

390
01:06:21,739 --> 01:06:24,314
Tell me about it, Elisabet.

391
01:06:25,203 --> 01:06:27,410
Then l will.

392
01:06:28,291 --> 01:06:33,834
lt was one night at a party, isn't
that so? lt got late and quite rowdy.

393
01:06:35,552 --> 01:06:39,421
Towards morning
someone in the group said:

394
01:06:39,558 --> 01:06:44,138
''Elisabet, you virtually have it all in
your armoury as a woman and artist.''

395
01:06:44,273 --> 01:06:47,275
''But you lack motherliness.''

396
01:06:48,154 --> 01:06:51,904
You laughed
because you thought it sounded silly.

397
01:06:52,035 --> 01:06:56,615
But after a while you noticed
you thought about what he'd said.

398
01:06:57,877 --> 01:07:03,835
You became more and more worried.
You let your husband impregnate you.

399
01:07:03,969 --> 01:07:07,137
You wanted to be a mother.

400
01:07:07,266 --> 01:07:11,016
When you realized it was definite,
you became frightened.

401
01:07:11,147 --> 01:07:17,104
Frightened of responsibility, of being
tied down, of leaving the theatre.

402
01:07:17,239 --> 01:07:23,743
Frightened of pain, of dying,
frightened of your body swelling up.

403
01:07:23,874 --> 01:07:29,630
But you played the role. The role
of a happy, young, expectant mother.

404
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:35,923
Everyone said, ''lsn't she beautiful?
She's never been so beautiful.''

405
01:07:38,855 --> 01:07:43,685
Meanwhile you tried to abort the foetus
several times.

406
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:46,360
But you failed.

407
01:07:46,491 --> 01:07:51,155
When you saw it was irreversible,
you started to hate the baby.

408
01:07:51,290 --> 01:07:54,992
And you wished it would be stillborn.

409
01:07:57,341 --> 01:08:00,676
You wished the baby would be dead.

410
01:08:02,473 --> 01:08:05,144
You wished for a dead baby.

411
01:08:10,026 --> 01:08:12,982
lt was a difficult and long delivery.

412
01:08:13,114 --> 01:08:19,202
You were in agony for days. Finally
the baby was delivered with forceps.

413
01:08:19,332 --> 01:08:23,545
You looked with disgust and terror
at your squealing baby and whispered:

414
01:08:23,672 --> 01:08:27,089
''Can't you die soon? Can't you die?''

415
01:08:28,929 --> 01:08:30,970
But he survived.

416
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,348
The boy screamed day and night.

417
01:08:38,235 --> 01:08:44,407
And you hated him. You were scared,
you had a bad conscience.

418
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:51,003
Finally the boy was taken care of
by relatives and a nanny.

419
01:08:51,129 --> 01:08:55,793
You could get up from your sickbed
and return to the theatre.

420
01:08:58,014 --> 01:09:01,681
But the suffering wasn't over.

421
01:09:01,812 --> 01:09:07,022
The boy was gripped by a massive
and unfathomable love for his mother.

422
01:09:07,153 --> 01:09:11,782
You defend yourself.
You defend yourself in despair.

423
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:18,415
You feel you can't return it.
So you try, and you try...

424
01:09:18,545 --> 01:09:22,165
But there are only cruel and clumsy
meetings between you.

425
01:09:22,301 --> 01:09:27,298
You can't do it.
You're cold and indifferent.

426
01:09:27,433 --> 01:09:32,679
He looks at you.
He loves you and he's so gentle.

427
01:09:32,816 --> 01:09:36,947
You want to hit him
because he doesn't leave you alone.

428
01:09:37,073 --> 01:09:41,238
You think he's disgusting
with his thick mouth and ugly body.

429
01:09:41,371 --> 01:09:46,035
His moist and pleading eyes.
He's disgusting and you're scared.

430
01:09:50,343 --> 01:09:55,137
What are you hiding
under your hand? Let me see.

431
01:09:59,189 --> 01:10:03,023
lt's the photo of your little boy.
The one you tore up.

432
01:10:03,153 --> 01:10:05,313
We must talk about it.

433
01:10:14,045 --> 01:10:16,537
Tell me about it, Elisabet.

434
01:10:19,261 --> 01:10:21,219
Then l will.

435
01:10:23,934 --> 01:10:27,471
lt was one night at a party,
isn't that right?

436
01:10:27,607 --> 01:10:31,606
lt got late and quite rowdy.

437
01:10:31,738 --> 01:10:35,488
Towards morning
someone in the group said:

438
01:10:35,619 --> 01:10:40,616
''Elisabet, you virtually have it all in
your armoury as a woman and artist.''

439
01:10:40,751 --> 01:10:43,422
''But you lack motherliness.''

440
01:10:44,924 --> 01:10:49,138
You laughed
because you thought it sounded silly.

441
01:10:49,264 --> 01:10:53,513
But after a while you noticed
you thought about what he'd said.

442
01:10:53,645 --> 01:10:59,188
You became more and more worried.
You let your husband impregnate you.

443
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:04,700
You wanted to be a mother.

444
01:11:05,956 --> 01:11:10,418
When you realized it was definite,
you became frightened.

445
01:11:10,546 --> 01:11:17,133
Frightened of responsibility, of being
tied down, of leaving the theatre.

446
01:11:17,264 --> 01:11:22,807
Frightened of pain, of dying,
frightened of your body swelling up.

447
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:31,152
But you played the role. The role
of a happy, young, expectant mother.

448
01:11:32,537 --> 01:11:37,664
Everyone said, ''lsn't she beautiful?
She's never been so beautiful.''

449
01:11:38,462 --> 01:11:42,676
Meanwhile you tried to abort the foetus
several times.

450
01:11:42,802 --> 01:11:44,926
But you failed.

451
01:11:46,474 --> 01:11:49,643
When you saw it was irreversible...

452
01:11:50,647 --> 01:11:53,733
...you started to hate the baby.

453
01:11:54,987 --> 01:11:58,405
And you wished it would be stillborn.

454
01:12:01,038 --> 01:12:04,206
You wished the baby would be dead.

455
01:12:08,299 --> 01:12:11,337
You wished for a dead baby.

456
01:12:15,142 --> 01:12:18,643
The delivery was difficult and long.

457
01:12:18,773 --> 01:12:24,896
You were in agony for days. Finally
the baby was delivered with forceps.

458
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:29,954
You looked with disgust and terror
at your squealing baby and whispered:

459
01:12:30,081 --> 01:12:34,211
''Can't you die soon? Can't you die?''

460
01:12:34,797 --> 01:12:39,710
The boy screamed day and night.
And you hated him.

461
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:44,644
You were scared,
you had a bad conscience.

462
01:12:46,147 --> 01:12:50,312
Finally the boy was taken care of
by relatives and a nanny.

463
01:12:50,445 --> 01:12:54,527
You could get up from your sickbed
and return to the theatre.

464
01:12:56,537 --> 01:12:59,623
But the suffering wasn't over.

465
01:13:00,919 --> 01:13:06,343
The boy was gripped by a massive
and unfathomable love for his mother.

466
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:12,308
You defend yourself in despair.
You feel you can't return it.

467
01:13:12,436 --> 01:13:15,107
So you try, and you try...

468
01:13:15,941 --> 01:13:19,811
But there are only cruel and clumsy
meetings between you.

469
01:13:19,947 --> 01:13:25,704
You can't do it.
You're cold and indifferent.

470
01:13:25,831 --> 01:13:31,076
He looks at you.
He loves you and he's so gentle.

471
01:13:31,214 --> 01:13:35,428
You want to hit him
because he doesn't leave you alone.

472
01:13:35,554 --> 01:13:39,684
You think he's disgusting
with his thick mouth and ugly body.

473
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:44,938
His moist and pleading eyes.
He's disgusting and you're scared.

474
01:13:53,122 --> 01:13:55,281
No!

475
01:13:56,168 --> 01:14:01,296
l'm not like you. l don't feel like you.

476
01:14:01,426 --> 01:14:05,046
l'm Sister Alma,
l'm just here to help you.

477
01:14:05,182 --> 01:14:09,893
l'm not Elisabet Vogler.
You are Elisabet Vogler.

478
01:14:10,022 --> 01:14:12,349
l would like to have...

479
01:14:13,402 --> 01:14:15,396
l love...

480
01:14:17,617 --> 01:14:19,575
l haven't...

481
01:14:53,379 --> 01:14:56,132
l've learnt quite a lot.

482
01:15:10,195 --> 01:15:13,317
We'll see how long l hold out.

483
01:15:18,541 --> 01:15:22,410
l'll never be like you, never.
l change all the time.

484
01:15:22,547 --> 01:15:26,416
You can do what you like,
you won't get to me anyhow.

485
01:15:59,936 --> 01:16:04,601
Saying doesn't help.
Cut a candle.

486
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:09,732
A kind of otherness.
Not now, no. No, no.

487
01:16:10,828 --> 01:16:14,530
Warning and out of time.
Unforeseen.

488
01:16:14,667 --> 01:16:19,130
When it was supposed to occur,
it didn't occur and so failure.

489
01:16:19,257 --> 01:16:23,043
Yourself where you are.
But l should do it.

490
01:16:23,221 --> 01:16:27,719
Not inwards, no...
Say collect and advise others...

491
01:16:27,853 --> 01:16:31,555
The disconsolate, perhaps...

492
01:16:35,448 --> 01:16:39,863
Take, yes... but what is closest...?

493
01:16:39,996 --> 01:16:44,078
What's it called...? No, no, no...

494
01:16:44,211 --> 01:16:47,166
Us, we, me, l...

495
01:16:47,299 --> 01:16:53,091
Many words and such nausea...
lncomprehensible pain. The throw...

496
01:18:25,404 --> 01:18:30,946
Try and listen to me now.
Repeat after me.

497
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:38,419
Nothing...

498
01:18:40,259 --> 01:18:44,638
Nothing. No, nothing...

499
01:18:51,818 --> 01:18:53,859
Nothing.

500
01:18:54,739 --> 01:19:00,032
That's it. That's good.
That's how it should be.
