1
00:03:13,018 --> 00:03:15,395
Hi. I've got an appointment
with Mr. Ullman.

2
00:03:15,604 --> 00:03:17,522
My name is Jack Torrance.

3
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,275
His office is the first door
on the left.

4
00:03:20,484 --> 00:03:21,693
Thank you.

5
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:39,920
Mr. Ullman?

6
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:41,380
I'm Jack Torrance.

7
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,548
Come on in, Jack.

8
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:47,177
-Very nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

9
00:03:47,386 --> 00:03:48,929
This is my secretary, Susie.

10
00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:51,807
-Susie, how do you do?
-Any trouble finding us?

11
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:54,851
No problem at all.
I made the trip in 3 1/2 hours.

12
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,978
That's very good time.

13
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,897
Sit down a minute, Jack.

14
00:03:59,147 --> 00:04:00,899
Just make yourself at home.

15
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,359
Like some coffee?

16
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:05,070
If you're having some,
I wouldn't mind. Thanks.

17
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,279
-Susie.
-Sure.

18
00:04:06,488 --> 00:04:08,198
And ask Bill Watson to join us.

19
00:04:08,407 --> 00:04:09,866
Yes, I will.

20
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:21,837
Mom?

21
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:23,880
Yeah?

22
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,926
Do you really want to go and live
in that hotel for the winter?

23
00:04:28,552 --> 00:04:29,886
Sure I do.

24
00:04:30,095 --> 00:04:32,055
It'll be lots of fun.

25
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,017
Yeah. I guess so.

26
00:04:36,226 --> 00:04:40,397
Anyway, there's hardly anybody
to play with around here.

27
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:44,818
I know. It always takes
a little time to make new friends.

28
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:48,572
Yeah, I guess so.

29
00:04:49,364 --> 00:04:50,365
What about Tony?

30
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:52,993
He's looking forward
to the hotel, I bet.

31
00:04:53,535 --> 00:04:55,912
No, I ain't, Mrs. Torrance.

32
00:04:56,288 --> 00:04:58,749
Now, come on, Tony.
Don't be silly.

33
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:01,126
I don't want to go there.

34
00:05:01,585 --> 00:05:03,628
How come you don't want to go?

35
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,964
Ijust don't.

36
00:05:06,214 --> 00:05:08,967
Let's just wait and see.

37
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:11,928
We're all going to have
a real good time.

38
00:05:13,305 --> 00:05:15,766
Bill, I'd like you
to meet Jack Torrance.

39
00:05:15,974 --> 00:05:17,434
How do you do, Bill?

40
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:19,603
-Nice to meet you.
-Pleasure to meet you.

41
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,730
Grab a chair, Bill. Join in.

42
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:26,068
Jack is going to take care of
the Overlook for us this winter.

43
00:05:26,276 --> 00:05:29,279
I'd like you to take him around
soon as we're through.

44
00:05:29,446 --> 00:05:30,405
Fine.

45
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,949
Jack is a schoolteacher.

46
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,160
Formerly a schoolteacher.

47
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:37,079
What line of work are you in now?

48
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:38,872
I'm a writer.

49
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:42,751
Teaching's been more or less
a way of making ends meet.

50
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,920
This ought to be
quite a change for you.

51
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:47,631
I'm looking for a change.

52
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,426
Our people in Denver recommended
Jack very highly, and for once...

53
00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:53,261
...I agree with them.

54
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,680
Let's see, where were we?

55
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,475
I was about to explain...

56
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:02,896
...that our season here runs from
May 15th to October 30th.

57
00:06:03,105 --> 00:06:06,566
Then we close down completely
until the following May.

58
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:09,569
Do you mind if I ask
why you do that?

59
00:06:09,778 --> 00:06:13,240
It seems to me that the skiing
up here would be fantastic.

60
00:06:13,448 --> 00:06:16,034
It would be. The problem is
the enormous cost...

61
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,787
...it would be to keep
the road to Sidewinder open.

62
00:06:19,454 --> 00:06:21,164
It's a 25-mile stretch of road.

63
00:06:21,373 --> 00:06:23,750
It gets 20 feet of snow
during the winter.

64
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:27,170
There's just no way to make it
economically feasible...

65
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:29,339
...to keep it clear.

66
00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:31,883
When the place was built in 1907...

67
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:34,636
...there was very little interest
in winter sports.

68
00:06:34,845 --> 00:06:39,725
This site was chosen for its
seclusion and scenic beauty.

69
00:06:39,975 --> 00:06:42,477
It's certainly got
plenty of that.

70
00:06:42,686 --> 00:06:43,895
That's right.

71
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,441
Did they give you
any idea in Denver...

72
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:49,317
...about what the job entails?

73
00:06:49,526 --> 00:06:51,611
Only in a very general way.

74
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:56,658
The winters can be
fantastically cruel.

75
00:06:56,867 --> 00:07:00,328
The basic idea is to cope
with the very costly damage...

76
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:02,539
...and depreciation
which can occur.

77
00:07:02,748 --> 00:07:05,208
This consists mainly
of running the boiler...

78
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:09,337
...heating different parts of the
hotel on a daily rotating basis...

79
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:12,257
...repairing damage as it occurs...

80
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:15,302
...and doing repairs so the
elements can't get a foothold.

81
00:07:16,386 --> 00:07:18,597
That sounds fine to me.

82
00:07:19,014 --> 00:07:21,975
Physically, it's not
a very demanding job.

83
00:07:22,184 --> 00:07:25,353
The only thing that can get a bit
trying here during the winter...

84
00:07:25,562 --> 00:07:28,190
...is a tremendous sense
of isolation.

85
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:33,862
That just happens to be
exactly what I'm looking for.

86
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:37,366
I'm outlining a new
writing project.

87
00:07:37,741 --> 00:07:41,078
Five months of peace
is just what I want.

88
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,580
That's very good, Jack.

89
00:07:43,872 --> 00:07:47,042
Because, for some people...

90
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,002
...solitude...

91
00:07:49,211 --> 00:07:50,837
...and isolation...

92
00:07:51,713 --> 00:07:53,965
...can, of itself, become a problem.

93
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:56,385
Not for me.

94
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,138
How about your wife and son?
Do you think they'll take to it?

95
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:03,100
They'll love it.

96
00:08:03,308 --> 00:08:04,518
Great.

97
00:08:07,437 --> 00:08:10,649
Before I turn you over to Bill...

98
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:14,361
...there's one other thing I think
we should talk about.

99
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:15,987
Not to sound melodramatic...

100
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,740
...but it's been known to
give a few people...

101
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:21,159
...second thoughts about the job.

102
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,537
I'm intrigued.

103
00:08:23,745 --> 00:08:26,081
I don't suppose they
said anything in Denver...

104
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:30,252
...about the tragedy we had up here
during the winter of 1970.

105
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:32,838
I don't believe they did.

106
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:37,134
My predecessor in this job...

107
00:08:37,843 --> 00:08:41,096
...hired a man named Charles Grady
as the winter caretaker.

108
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:44,808
He came up with his wife and
2 little girls of about 8 and 10.

109
00:08:45,016 --> 00:08:48,019
He had a good employment record,
good references.

110
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:50,480
And from what I've been told,
he seemed...

111
00:08:50,689 --> 00:08:53,400
...like a completely
normal individual.

112
00:08:53,608 --> 00:08:55,986
But at some point
during the winter...

113
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:59,781
...he must have suffered some kind
of a complete mental breakdown.

114
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,367
He ran amuck...

115
00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:07,956
...and killed his family
with an ax.

116
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:13,879
Stacked them neatly in a room
in the west wing, and then...

117
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:18,383
...he put both barrels
of his shotgun in his mouth.

118
00:09:19,634 --> 00:09:21,428
The police thought...

119
00:09:21,636 --> 00:09:25,682
...that it was what the old-timers
used to call cabin fever.

120
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:28,935
A kind of claustrophobic reaction
which can occur...

121
00:09:29,144 --> 00:09:33,273
...when people are shut in together
over long periods of time.

122
00:09:38,361 --> 00:09:39,780
That is...

123
00:09:39,988 --> 00:09:41,490
...quite a story.

124
00:09:42,824 --> 00:09:44,284
Yeah, it is.

125
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:48,705
It's still hard for me to believe
it actually happened here.

126
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,707
But it did.

127
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:56,505
I think you can appreciate
why I wanted to tell you about it.

128
00:09:57,047 --> 00:09:59,549
I certainly can.

129
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,636
I also understand
why your people in Denver...

130
00:10:02,844 --> 00:10:05,097
...left it for you to tell me.

131
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:09,017
Obviously, some people
can be put off...

132
00:10:09,226 --> 00:10:13,313
...from staying in a place where
something like that happened.

133
00:10:13,522 --> 00:10:18,402
You can rest assured that's not
going to happen with me.

134
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,280
And as far as my wife
is concerned...

135
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:26,326
...l'm sure she'll be absolutely
fascinated when I tell her.

136
00:10:26,535 --> 00:10:29,371
She's a confirmed ghost story...

137
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:31,998
...and horror film addict.

138
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:40,549
Tony, do you think
Dad'll get the job?

139
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:44,136
He already did.

140
00:10:44,594 --> 00:10:48,306
He's going to phone Wendy up
in a few minutes to tell her.

141
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,699
-Hi, babe.
-Hi, hon. How's it going?

142
00:11:05,907 --> 00:11:09,494
Great. I'm at the hotel and
I still have a lot to go through.

143
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:12,831
I don't think I can get home
before 9:00 or 10:00.

144
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,541
Sounds like you got the job.

145
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,461
Right. It's a beautiful place.

146
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:19,755
You and Danny are going to love it.

147
00:11:21,256 --> 00:11:24,134
Tony, why don't you want to go
to the hotel?

148
00:11:24,426 --> 00:11:26,136
I don't know.

149
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,766
You do too know.
Now come on, tell me.

150
00:11:31,308 --> 00:11:33,393
I don't want to.

151
00:11:34,102 --> 00:11:35,353
Please.

152
00:11:36,605 --> 00:11:37,731
No.

153
00:11:38,023 --> 00:11:40,108
Now, Tony, tell me.

154
00:12:10,013 --> 00:12:12,766
Now, hold your eyes still
so I can see.

155
00:12:17,229 --> 00:12:19,481
That's good. Now the other one.

156
00:12:20,857 --> 00:12:22,359
Good boy.

157
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,034
Now, Danny...

158
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:33,537
...when you were brushing
your teeth...

159
00:12:33,745 --> 00:12:36,748
...do you remember if you
smelled anything funny...

160
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:41,712
...or saw any bright, flashing
lights or anything at all strange?

161
00:12:44,548 --> 00:12:45,716
No.

162
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,302
Do you remember when you were
brushing your teeth?

163
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:51,179
Yes.

164
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:55,934
What's the next thing you remember
after you were brushing your teeth?

165
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:02,774
My mom was saying, "Wake up.
Wake up, Danny, wake up."

166
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:09,239
Can you remember
what you were doing...

167
00:13:09,406 --> 00:13:12,367
...just before you started
brushing your teeth?

168
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,621
Talking to Tony.

169
00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:19,666
Is Tony one of your animals?

170
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:23,462
No. He's a little boy
that lives in my mouth.

171
00:13:23,754 --> 00:13:26,173
Tony's his imaginary friend.

172
00:13:29,092 --> 00:13:32,512
If you were to open your mouth now,
could I see Tony?

173
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:36,433
Why not?

174
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:39,519
Because he hides.

175
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,897
Where does he go?

176
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,816
To my stomach.

177
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,780
Does Tony ever tell you
to do things?

178
00:13:53,825 --> 00:13:56,495
I don't want to talk
about Tony anymore.

179
00:13:59,122 --> 00:14:00,582
That's fine.

180
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,126
All right, Danny.

181
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,755
I'm going to ask you
to do me a favor...

182
00:14:06,963 --> 00:14:10,300
...and stay quietly in bed
for the rest of the day. Okay?

183
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:11,635
Do I have to?

184
00:14:11,843 --> 00:14:14,137
Yes. I'd like you to.

185
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:17,099
We're going in the other room
for a few minutes and talk.

186
00:14:17,307 --> 00:14:19,434
I'll come back and check on you.

187
00:14:27,943 --> 00:14:30,320
-Shall we go into the living room?
-Yes.

188
00:14:34,032 --> 00:14:35,909
-Please.
-Thank you.

189
00:14:39,788 --> 00:14:44,167
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

190
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:48,380
I'm quite sure there's nothing
physically wrong with Danny.

191
00:14:53,135 --> 00:14:56,263
He seems absolutely fine now.

192
00:14:56,471 --> 00:14:57,472
But you should've seen him.

193
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,141
I know.

194
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:01,059
IKids can scare you to death.

195
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:04,146
But believe me, these episodes
are not at all uncommon.

196
00:15:04,354 --> 00:15:06,898
And they look much worse
than they are.

197
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:10,110
But what was the matter with him?

198
00:15:10,318 --> 00:15:14,406
Most of the time, these episodes
with kids are never explained.

199
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:19,494
They're brought on by emotional
factors and rarely occur again.

200
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:23,248
They're more akin
to autohypnosis...

201
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:26,418
...a kind of self-induced trance.

202
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,628
If it reoccurs, which I doubt...

203
00:15:29,504 --> 00:15:32,591
...we can always think about
having some tests done.

204
00:15:35,218 --> 00:15:37,471
I'm sure you're right.

205
00:15:39,097 --> 00:15:41,808
Have you been in Boulder long?

206
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:43,894
Only about three months.

207
00:15:44,102 --> 00:15:47,481
We're from Vermont. My husband
was teaching school there.

208
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:53,278
Did the appearance
of Danny's imaginary friend....

209
00:15:53,737 --> 00:15:54,571
Tony.

210
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:58,700
Did Tony's first appearance happen
to coincide with your arrival here?

211
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:03,163
Let's see....

212
00:16:03,872 --> 00:16:06,416
I guess Danny started
talking to Tony...

213
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,336
...about the time we put him
in nursery school.

214
00:16:09,753 --> 00:16:12,047
Did he adjust well to school?

215
00:16:14,257 --> 00:16:16,176
He didn't like it too much
at first.

216
00:16:16,385 --> 00:16:19,679
Then he had an injury, so we kept
him out for a while and....

217
00:16:21,098 --> 00:16:24,976
I guess that's about when I first
noticed he was talking to Tony.

218
00:16:25,977 --> 00:16:28,397
What sort of injury did he have?

219
00:16:29,064 --> 00:16:31,233
He dislocated his shoulder.

220
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,944
How did he manage to do that?

221
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:40,450
It was just one of
those things, you know.

222
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:42,661
Purely an accident.

223
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,456
My husband had been drinking...

224
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:49,960
...and he came home
about three hours late.

225
00:16:50,293 --> 00:16:54,840
So he wasn't exactly
in the greatest mood that night.

226
00:16:55,590 --> 00:17:00,345
And Danny had scattered some of his
school papers all over the room...

227
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:04,850
...and my husband grabbed his arm
to pull him away from them.

228
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:08,103
It's just the sort of thing you do
100 times with a child...

229
00:17:08,311 --> 00:17:10,355
...you know, in a park
or in the street.

230
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:14,109
But on this particular occasion...

231
00:17:14,317 --> 00:17:16,945
...my husband just used
too much strength...

232
00:17:17,154 --> 00:17:19,740
...and he injured Danny's arm.

233
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:27,289
Anyway, something good did come out
of it all because he said...

234
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:30,125
..."Wendy, I'm never going to
touch another drop.

235
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,252
And if I do, you can leave me."

236
00:17:32,461 --> 00:17:33,795
And he didn't.

237
00:17:34,004 --> 00:17:38,467
He hasn't had any
alcohol in 5 months.

238
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:09,498
We must really be high up.
The air feels so different.

239
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,380
Dad?

240
00:18:19,216 --> 00:18:20,884
I'm hungry.

241
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:25,472
You should've eaten your breakfast.

242
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:29,226
We'll get you something
as soon as we get to the hotel.

243
00:18:29,393 --> 00:18:31,019
Okay, Mom.

244
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:36,608
Wasn't it around here that
the Donner party got snowbound?

245
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,863
I think that was farther west,
in the Sierras.

246
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:45,742
What was the Donner party?

247
00:18:47,703 --> 00:18:51,957
They were a party of settlers
in covered wagon times.

248
00:18:52,207 --> 00:18:55,460
They got snowbound one winter
in the mountains.

249
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:59,881
They had to resort to cannibalism
in order to stay alive.

250
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:03,927
You mean they ate each other up?

251
00:19:04,094 --> 00:19:07,222
They had to in order to survive.

252
00:19:07,431 --> 00:19:08,640
Jack.

253
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:09,933
Don't worry, Mom.

254
00:19:10,142 --> 00:19:14,479
I know all about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.

255
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:17,315
See, it's okay.

256
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,943
He saw it all on the television.

257
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,476
-What time does the plane leave?
-8:30.

258
00:19:52,684 --> 00:19:55,479
That gives us plenty of time
to go over everything.

259
00:19:55,645 --> 00:19:57,606
-Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
-Bye.

260
00:19:57,814 --> 00:20:00,942
Good morning. I hope you
haven't been waiting too long.

261
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,779
No problem. We had time
to grab a bite to eat.

262
00:20:03,987 --> 00:20:06,865
Good. Glad you made it
before they shut down the kitchen.

263
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:08,784
Is your family
having a look around?

264
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:12,371
No, my son's
discovered the games room.

265
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:15,665
-Has your luggage been brought in?
-Right there.

266
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:18,210
In view of all we have
to cover today...

267
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:22,089
...l suggest we have a quick look
at your apartment and get started.

268
00:20:22,297 --> 00:20:25,050
Have the Torrances' things
brought to their apartment.

269
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:27,969
I'd better collect my family first.

270
00:20:36,103 --> 00:20:38,480
This is our Colorado Lounge.

271
00:20:38,688 --> 00:20:41,108
It's beautiful.

272
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:43,360
My God!

273
00:20:43,568 --> 00:20:46,154
This place is fantastic,
isn't it, hon?

274
00:20:46,363 --> 00:20:47,698
It sure is.

275
00:20:47,864 --> 00:20:50,701
I've never seen anything
like this before.

276
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:54,287
Are all these
lndian designs authentic?

277
00:20:54,496 --> 00:20:55,914
I believe they're based...

278
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:59,334
...mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.

279
00:20:59,543 --> 00:21:01,503
They're really gorgeous.

280
00:21:01,712 --> 00:21:02,713
As a matter of fact...

281
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:06,007
...this is probably the most
gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.

282
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:09,386
This old place has had
an illustrious past.

283
00:21:09,594 --> 00:21:12,681
In its heyday, it was a stopping
place for the jet setters...

284
00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:15,892
...even before anybody knew
what a jet set was.

285
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:19,146
We had four presidents
who stayed here.

286
00:21:19,396 --> 00:21:20,689
Lots of movie stars.

287
00:21:20,897 --> 00:21:22,441
Royalty?

288
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,234
All the best people.

289
00:22:17,329 --> 00:22:19,915
This is the staff wing
of the hotel.

290
00:22:20,874 --> 00:22:24,211
None of the other bedrooms
are heated during the winter.

291
00:22:24,461 --> 00:22:27,339
-Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
-Goodbye, girls.

292
00:22:27,589 --> 00:22:29,591
And here are your quarters.

293
00:22:29,966 --> 00:22:32,594
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.

294
00:22:32,803 --> 00:22:35,263
And a small bedroom for your son.

295
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:40,936
Perfect for a child.

296
00:22:48,151 --> 00:22:51,613
Well, then. Place is
very nicely self-contained.

297
00:22:51,822 --> 00:22:53,365
Easy to keep.

298
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,202
Cozy.

299
00:22:57,411 --> 00:22:59,663
Yes, very cozy for a family.

300
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:01,581
If you feel like spreading out...

301
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,459
...you have the rest of the hotel
to move around in.

302
00:23:06,086 --> 00:23:08,588
Well, it's very...

303
00:23:09,131 --> 00:23:10,424
...homey.

304
00:23:13,343 --> 00:23:15,595
This is our famous hedge maze.

305
00:23:15,804 --> 00:23:20,100
It's quite an attraction here.
The walls are 13 feet high...

306
00:23:20,308 --> 00:23:22,602
...and the hedge is as old
as the hotel itself.

307
00:23:22,811 --> 00:23:25,439
A lot of fun, but I wouldn't
want to go in there...

308
00:23:25,647 --> 00:23:28,650
...unless I had an hour
to spare to find my way out.

309
00:23:30,027 --> 00:23:32,154
When was the Overlook built?

310
00:23:33,155 --> 00:23:35,365
Construction started in 1907.

311
00:23:35,574 --> 00:23:37,534
It was finished in 1909.

312
00:23:37,743 --> 00:23:40,412
The site's supposed to be
on an lndian burial ground.

313
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,247
They actually had to repel...

314
00:23:42,456 --> 00:23:45,375
...a few lndian attacks as they
were building it.

315
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,878
That's our Snowcat.

316
00:23:48,545 --> 00:23:50,589
Can you both drive a car?

317
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:54,676
That's fine. Basically the Snowcat
operates very much like a car.

318
00:23:54,885 --> 00:23:57,471
It won't take you long
to get the hang of it.

319
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,059
As a matter of fact, we brought
a decorator in from Chicago...

320
00:24:02,225 --> 00:24:05,353
...just last year to refurbish
this part of the hotel.

321
00:24:05,562 --> 00:24:07,564
He sure did a beautiful job.

322
00:24:07,731 --> 00:24:10,067
Pink and gold
are my favorite colors.

323
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:13,236
This is our Gold Ballroom.

324
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:16,073
I'll say!

325
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:20,077
We can accommodate up to
300 people here very comfortably.

326
00:24:20,577 --> 00:24:23,455
Boy, we could really have
a good party in this room.

327
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:27,459
I'm afraid you won't do too well
here unless you brought supplies.

328
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:30,712
We remove the booze from
the premises when we shut down.

329
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:34,007
That reduces the insurance
we normally have to carry.

330
00:24:34,216 --> 00:24:35,175
We don't drink.

331
00:24:35,384 --> 00:24:36,802
Then you're in luck.

332
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:41,264
Dick, come on over and say hello
to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.

333
00:24:41,431 --> 00:24:43,558
This is Dick Hallorann,
our head chef.

334
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:46,520
Mr. Hallorann, I'm Jack.
This is my wife, Winifred.

335
00:24:46,728 --> 00:24:47,896
Glad to meet you.

336
00:24:48,105 --> 00:24:50,982
The Torrances will take care
of the Overlook this winter.

337
00:24:51,191 --> 00:24:54,945
That's just great. How do you
folks like our hotel so far?

338
00:24:55,112 --> 00:24:56,988
It's just wonderful.

339
00:24:57,197 --> 00:24:58,740
Hi, Danny!

340
00:24:59,616 --> 00:25:02,327
I found him outside
looking for you.

341
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:06,415
Did you get tired
of bombing the universe?

342
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:09,292
Come on over here.

343
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:10,669
Thank you, Susie.

344
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:14,881
I think it'd be good if you could
show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen...

345
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,967
...while I continue on with Jack.

346
00:25:17,134 --> 00:25:19,594
It would be a pleasure.
Right this way.

347
00:25:19,803 --> 00:25:21,346
Great. See you later, hon.

348
00:25:21,555 --> 00:25:22,931
Bye, darling.

349
00:25:25,308 --> 00:25:28,645
Mrs. Torrance, your husband
introduced you as Winifred.

350
00:25:28,812 --> 00:25:31,356
Now, are you a "Winnie,"
or a "Freddie"?

351
00:25:31,565 --> 00:25:32,816
I'm a Wendy.

352
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:36,236
Wendy. That's nice.
That's the prettiest.

353
00:25:36,445 --> 00:25:38,071
This is the kitchen, huh?

354
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,865
This is it.

355
00:25:40,073 --> 00:25:42,993
How do you like it, Danny?
ls it big enough for you?

356
00:25:43,827 --> 00:25:46,038
It's the biggest place I ever seen.

357
00:25:46,288 --> 00:25:48,623
This whole place
is such an enormous maze.

358
00:25:48,832 --> 00:25:52,377
I'll have to leave a trail of
breadcrumbs every time I come in.

359
00:25:53,295 --> 00:25:55,172
Don't let it get you down.

360
00:25:55,338 --> 00:25:57,841
It's big, but it ain't
nothing but a kitchen.

361
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,260
A lot of this stuff
you'll never have to touch.

362
00:26:00,469 --> 00:26:02,679
I wouldn't know
what to do with it if I did.

363
00:26:02,888 --> 00:26:06,016
One thing for sure, you don't
have to worry about food.

364
00:26:06,224 --> 00:26:10,896
You folks could eat here for a year
and never have the same menu twice.

365
00:26:11,104 --> 00:26:14,191
Right here is
our walk-in freezer.

366
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,403
This is where we keep
all of our meat.

367
00:26:18,612 --> 00:26:20,614
You got 15 rib roasts...

368
00:26:20,822 --> 00:26:22,949
...30 ten-pound bags of hamburger.

369
00:26:23,158 --> 00:26:26,203
We got 12 turkeys,
about 40 chickens...

370
00:26:26,411 --> 00:26:29,498
...50 sirloin steaks,
two dozen of pork roast...

371
00:26:29,706 --> 00:26:32,709
...and 20 legs of lamb.
Do you like lamb, Doc?

372
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,296
You don't?
What's your favorite food, then?

373
00:26:36,505 --> 00:26:38,382
French fries and ketchup.

374
00:26:39,091 --> 00:26:41,093
I think we can
manage that too, Doc.

375
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:43,053
Come along, now.
Watch your step.

376
00:26:49,768 --> 00:26:51,353
How'd you know we call him Doc?

377
00:26:51,561 --> 00:26:55,565
-Beg your pardon?
-Doc. You called Danny "Doc" twice.

378
00:26:55,774 --> 00:26:57,192
I did?

379
00:26:57,984 --> 00:27:01,113
We call him Doc sometimes,
like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.

380
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:02,572
But how did you know?

381
00:27:02,781 --> 00:27:05,325
I guess I probably
heard you call him that.

382
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:07,786
It's possible.
But I honestly don't remember...

383
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:10,205
...calling him that
since we've been with you.

384
00:27:10,414 --> 00:27:12,582
Anyway, he looks
like a Doc, doesn't he?

385
00:27:14,042 --> 00:27:15,460
What's up, Doc?

386
00:27:17,295 --> 00:27:19,506
Now, this is the storeroom.

387
00:27:21,258 --> 00:27:23,093
In here is where we keep...

388
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,096
...all the dried goods
and the canned goods.

389
00:27:26,263 --> 00:27:28,724
We got canned fruits
and vegetables...

390
00:27:28,932 --> 00:27:32,728
...canned fish and meats,
hot and cold cereals.

391
00:27:32,936 --> 00:27:36,106
Post Toasties, Corn Flakes,
Sugar Puffs...

392
00:27:36,314 --> 00:27:40,360
...Rice IKrispies, oatmeal,
Wheatena and Cream of Wheat.

393
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:43,030
You got a dozen jugs
of black molasses.

394
00:27:43,238 --> 00:27:46,408
We got 60 boxes of dried milk...

395
00:27:54,082 --> 00:27:56,543
How'd you like some ice cream, Doc?

396
00:27:58,962 --> 00:28:00,922
Sociables, finger rolls...

397
00:28:01,131 --> 00:28:02,674
...and 7 kinds of what have you.

398
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:06,428
Now, we've got dried peaches,
dried apricots...

399
00:28:06,636 --> 00:28:09,723
...dried raisins and dried prunes.

400
00:28:09,931 --> 00:28:14,227
You know, you got to keep regular
if you want to be happy.

401
00:28:17,147 --> 00:28:18,774
-How're you getting on?
-Fine.

402
00:28:18,982 --> 00:28:22,527
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?
We're on our way to the basement.

403
00:28:22,736 --> 00:28:24,654
I promise we won't
keep her very long.

404
00:28:24,863 --> 00:28:28,075
No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just
getting to the ice cream.

405
00:28:28,283 --> 00:28:30,160
You like ice cream, Doc?

406
00:28:30,994 --> 00:28:31,995
I thought you did.

407
00:28:32,162 --> 00:28:35,248
You folks mind if I give Danny
some ice cream while we wait?

408
00:28:35,457 --> 00:28:37,292
-Not at all.
-We don't mind.

409
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:39,669
-Good.
-Sound good to you, Doc?

410
00:28:39,878 --> 00:28:41,963
Okay, you behave yourself.

411
00:28:44,966 --> 00:28:46,843
What kind of ice cream
do you like?

412
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:47,928
Chocolate.

413
00:28:48,136 --> 00:28:51,098
Chocolate it shall be.
Come on, son.

414
00:28:55,685 --> 00:28:57,646
It's amazing, all this
activity today.

415
00:28:57,854 --> 00:29:00,691
The guests and some staff
left yesterday, but the...

416
00:29:00,857 --> 00:29:02,317
...last day's always hectic.

417
00:29:02,526 --> 00:29:05,570
Everybody wants to be on their way
as early as possible.

418
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:09,825
By 5:00 tonight, you'll never
know anybody was ever here.

419
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:12,077
Just like a ghost ship, huh?

420
00:29:17,749 --> 00:29:20,711
Do you know how I knew
your name was Doc?

421
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,720
You know what I'm
talking about, don't you?

422
00:29:36,685 --> 00:29:40,188
I can remember when I was
a little boy...

423
00:29:40,564 --> 00:29:43,108
...my grandmother and I
could hold conversations...

424
00:29:43,316 --> 00:29:47,154
...entirely without ever
opening our mouths.

425
00:29:48,238 --> 00:29:50,532
She called it "shining."

426
00:29:52,034 --> 00:29:54,745
And for a long time I thought
it was just the two of us...

427
00:29:54,953 --> 00:29:57,581
...that had "the shine" to us.

428
00:29:58,206 --> 00:30:01,209
Just like you probably thought
you was the only one.

429
00:30:01,877 --> 00:30:03,754
But there are other folks...

430
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,674
...though mostly they don't
know it, or don't believe it.

431
00:30:12,345 --> 00:30:14,765
How long have you
been able to do it?

432
00:30:19,978 --> 00:30:22,397
Why don't you want
to talk about it?

433
00:30:27,611 --> 00:30:29,696
I'm not supposed to.

434
00:30:31,281 --> 00:30:33,784
Who says you ain't supposed to?

435
00:30:37,245 --> 00:30:38,622
Tony.

436
00:30:40,624 --> 00:30:42,250
Who's Tony?

437
00:30:44,753 --> 00:30:48,131
Tony's the little boy
that lives in my mouth.

438
00:30:50,092 --> 00:30:52,094
Is Tony the one
that...

439
00:30:52,302 --> 00:30:53,887
...tells you things?

440
00:30:58,433 --> 00:31:00,811
How does he tell you things?

441
00:31:02,646 --> 00:31:06,942
It's like I go to sleep,
and he shows me things.

442
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:11,238
But when I wake up,
I can't remember everything.

443
00:31:13,073 --> 00:31:16,785
Does your mom and dad
know about Tony?

444
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,624
Do they know he tells you things?

445
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,461
Tony told me never to tell them.

446
00:31:28,588 --> 00:31:31,967
Has Tony ever told you
anything about this place?

447
00:31:32,175 --> 00:31:34,720
About the Overlook Hotel?

448
00:31:38,014 --> 00:31:39,558
I don't know.

449
00:31:40,475 --> 00:31:43,270
Now think real hard, Doc.

450
00:31:43,478 --> 00:31:44,479
Think.

451
00:31:47,607 --> 00:31:50,318
Maybe he showed me something.

452
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:53,905
Try to think of what it was.

453
00:31:56,908 --> 00:32:00,203
Mr. Hallorann, are you scared
of this place?

454
00:32:03,331 --> 00:32:05,542
Scared of nothing here.

455
00:32:06,043 --> 00:32:07,502
It's just that...

456
00:32:08,253 --> 00:32:11,089
...you know, some places
are like people.

457
00:32:11,923 --> 00:32:13,633
Some shine...

458
00:32:13,842 --> 00:32:15,218
...and some don't.

459
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,597
I guess you could say
the Overlook Hotel...

460
00:32:18,805 --> 00:32:22,100
...has something about it
that's like shining.

461
00:32:25,145 --> 00:32:27,564
Is there something bad here?

462
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:41,578
You know, Doc,
when something happens...

463
00:32:41,787 --> 00:32:45,415
...it can leave a trace
of itself behind.

464
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:47,751
Say, like...

465
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:51,046
...if someone burns toast.

466
00:32:53,131 --> 00:32:57,803
Maybe things that happen
leave other kind of traces behind.

467
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:02,432
Not things that anyone
can notice.

468
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:07,437
But things that people
who shine can see.

469
00:33:08,522 --> 00:33:11,817
Just like they can see things
that haven't happened yet...

470
00:33:14,111 --> 00:33:18,240
...sometimes they can see things
that happened a long time ago.

471
00:33:19,783 --> 00:33:22,661
I think a lot of things
happened right here...

472
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:26,581
...in this particular hotel
over the years.

473
00:33:27,124 --> 00:33:29,501
And not all of them
was good.

474
00:33:32,796 --> 00:33:35,424
What about room 237?

475
00:33:38,802 --> 00:33:40,971
Room 237?

476
00:33:42,305 --> 00:33:45,392
You're scared of room 237,
ain't you?

477
00:33:47,144 --> 00:33:48,645
No, I ain't.

478
00:33:50,147 --> 00:33:53,984
Mr. Hallorann, what is in room 237?

479
00:33:55,318 --> 00:33:56,653
Nothing.

480
00:33:57,112 --> 00:34:00,323
There ain't nothing in room 237.

481
00:34:00,532 --> 00:34:03,785
But you ain't got no business
going in there anyway.

482
00:34:03,994 --> 00:34:06,121
So stay out.

483
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:08,790
You understand? Stay out!

484
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:49,891
Good morning, hon.

485
00:35:51,935 --> 00:35:53,687
Your breakfast is ready.

486
00:35:54,438 --> 00:35:56,064
What time is it?

487
00:35:56,273 --> 00:35:58,150
It's about 11:30.

488
00:36:00,068 --> 00:36:01,653
Jesus.

489
00:36:02,612 --> 00:36:05,032
I guess we've been
staying up too late.

490
00:36:05,323 --> 00:36:06,783
I know it.

491
00:36:08,076 --> 00:36:10,954
I made them just the way
you like them, sunny-side up.

492
00:36:11,246 --> 00:36:12,789
Nice.

493
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:16,877
It's really pretty outside.

494
00:36:17,085 --> 00:36:20,297
How about taking me for a walk
after you finish your breakfast?

495
00:36:20,922 --> 00:36:25,260
I suppose I ought to try
to do some writing first.

496
00:36:26,678 --> 00:36:28,346
Any ideas yet?

497
00:36:29,347 --> 00:36:31,016
Lots of ideas.

498
00:36:31,224 --> 00:36:32,768
No good ones.

499
00:36:33,226 --> 00:36:35,687
Something will come.

500
00:36:36,188 --> 00:36:40,150
It's just a matter of settling into
the habit of writing every day.

501
00:36:41,693 --> 00:36:43,403
That's all it is.

502
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:47,824
It's really nice up here,
isn't it?

503
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,659
I love it.

504
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,745
I really do.

505
00:36:52,662 --> 00:36:55,665
I've never been this happy
or comfortable anywhere.

506
00:36:55,874 --> 00:36:59,669
It's amazing how fast you get
used to such a big place.

507
00:36:59,836 --> 00:37:02,756
I tell you, when we first
came up here...

508
00:37:02,964 --> 00:37:05,008
...l thought it was kind of scary.

509
00:37:05,467 --> 00:37:08,011
I fell in love with it right away.

510
00:37:08,678 --> 00:37:11,515
When I came up here
for my interview...

511
00:37:11,848 --> 00:37:15,686
...it was as though
I'd been here before.

512
00:37:15,894 --> 00:37:18,522
I mean, we all have moments
of deja vu...

513
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,941
...but this was ridiculous.

514
00:37:21,692 --> 00:37:23,527
It was almost as though I knew...

515
00:37:23,735 --> 00:37:27,489
...what was going to be
around every corner.

516
00:38:00,605 --> 00:38:03,817
The loser has to keep
America clean. How's that?

517
00:38:04,026 --> 00:38:06,570
-All right.
-And you're going to lose.

518
00:38:06,778 --> 00:38:09,906
And I'm going to get you.
You'd better run fast!

519
00:38:14,911 --> 00:38:16,038
Look out!

520
00:38:16,246 --> 00:38:18,123
I'm coming in close.

521
00:38:18,331 --> 00:38:20,834
Loser has to keep America clean.

522
00:38:21,084 --> 00:38:22,711
IKeep America clean.

523
00:38:23,712 --> 00:38:25,172
Danny, you win.

524
00:38:25,505 --> 00:38:27,841
Let's take the rest
of this walking.

525
00:38:30,385 --> 00:38:31,762
Give me your hand.

526
00:38:34,431 --> 00:38:36,224
Isn't it beautiful?

527
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,327
Dead end.

528
00:39:52,801 --> 00:39:54,428
We made it.

529
00:39:54,928 --> 00:39:56,138
Isn't it beautiful?

530
00:40:17,868 --> 00:40:19,703
It's so pretty.

531
00:40:24,249 --> 00:40:27,210
I didn't think it was
going to be this big. Did you?

532
00:40:38,513 --> 00:40:40,891
Rutherford was serving
a life sentence...

533
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:42,851
...for a 1968 shooting.

534
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:46,938
And the search continues
for that missing Aspen woman.

535
00:40:47,147 --> 00:40:50,525
24-year-old Susan Robertson
has been missing 10 days.

536
00:40:50,734 --> 00:40:53,445
She disappeared on a hunting
trip with her husband.

537
00:40:53,653 --> 00:40:56,448
They may have to
call off the search...

538
00:40:56,656 --> 00:40:59,201
...if a predicted snowstorm
moves in tomorrow.

539
00:40:59,409 --> 00:41:01,244
It's so beautiful
in Denver today...

540
00:41:01,453 --> 00:41:03,580
...it's hard to believe
a snowstorm could be close.

541
00:41:03,789 --> 00:41:06,041
I want to go outside
and lie in the sun...

542
00:41:06,249 --> 00:41:10,379
...yet to our north, to our west,
it is snowing and cold.

543
00:41:10,587 --> 00:41:11,755
And it's moving...

544
00:41:11,963 --> 00:41:15,133
...right here towards Colorado
as we talk. It's incredible.

545
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,200
Hi, hon.

546
00:43:48,787 --> 00:43:50,205
How's it going?

547
00:43:52,749 --> 00:43:53,917
Fine.

548
00:43:56,044 --> 00:43:57,587
Get a lot written today?

549
00:44:04,636 --> 00:44:07,222
The weather forecast
said it's going to snow tonight.

550
00:44:12,436 --> 00:44:14,771
What do you want me
to do about it?

551
00:44:16,898 --> 00:44:19,067
Come on, hon.

552
00:44:19,401 --> 00:44:21,403
Don't be so grouchy.

553
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,155
I'm not...

554
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:24,740
...being grouchy.

555
00:44:24,948 --> 00:44:27,743
I just want to finish my work.

556
00:44:31,246 --> 00:44:33,623
Okay. I understand.

557
00:44:33,874 --> 00:44:36,460
I'll come back later
with a couple of sandwiches.

558
00:44:36,668 --> 00:44:39,129
Maybe you'll let me
read something then.

559
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,425
Wendy...

560
00:44:43,633 --> 00:44:46,261
...let me explain something to you.

561
00:44:47,137 --> 00:44:51,016
When you come in and interrupt,
you're breaking my concentration.

562
00:44:51,224 --> 00:44:52,642
You're distracting me...

563
00:44:52,851 --> 00:44:56,313
...and it will then take me time
to get back to where I was.

564
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,939
Understand?

565
00:45:01,401 --> 00:45:02,569
Fine.

566
00:45:03,737 --> 00:45:05,447
We're going to make a new rule:

567
00:45:05,655 --> 00:45:07,115
Whenever I'm in here...

568
00:45:07,324 --> 00:45:09,576
...and you hear me typing...

569
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:14,331
...or whatever the fuck
you hear me doing in here...

570
00:45:14,498 --> 00:45:16,833
...when I'm in here,
that means I am working.

571
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,252
That means don't come in.

572
00:45:19,461 --> 00:45:21,713
Now, do you think
you can handle that?

573
00:45:26,343 --> 00:45:27,469
Fine.

574
00:45:28,512 --> 00:45:31,848
Why don't you start right now
and get the fuck out of here?

575
00:46:07,759 --> 00:46:09,136
All right, you!

576
00:46:10,554 --> 00:46:12,389
I know you've got more.

577
00:46:14,474 --> 00:46:15,517
Missed!

578
00:46:21,106 --> 00:46:21,940
Don't have!

579
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:23,900
No fair anymore.

580
00:47:31,593 --> 00:47:32,886
I knew it.

581
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:06,628
This is KDK 12 calling KDK 1.

582
00:48:09,172 --> 00:48:12,843
KDK 12 to KDK 1.

583
00:48:13,051 --> 00:48:16,179
This is KDK 1 .
We're receiving you. Over.

584
00:48:16,555 --> 00:48:19,683
Hi, this is Wendy Torrance
at the Overlook Hotel.

585
00:48:20,267 --> 00:48:23,061
Hi, how are you folks
getting on up there? Over.

586
00:48:23,353 --> 00:48:24,688
We're just fine.

587
00:48:24,855 --> 00:48:27,357
But our telephones
aren't doing too well.

588
00:48:27,524 --> 00:48:30,569
Are the lines down,
by any chance? Over.

589
00:48:31,194 --> 00:48:35,032
Yes, quite a few of them are down
due to the storm. Over.

590
00:48:35,323 --> 00:48:38,493
Any chance of them
being repaired soon? Over.

591
00:48:38,702 --> 00:48:39,870
Well, I wouldn't like to say.

592
00:48:40,078 --> 00:48:43,540
Most winters they stay that way
until spring. Over.

593
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:47,419
Boy, this storm is really something,
isn't it? Over.

594
00:48:47,878 --> 00:48:50,797
Yes. It's one of the worst we've
had for years.

595
00:48:51,381 --> 00:48:54,551
Is there anything else we can
do for you, Mrs. Torrance?

596
00:48:55,052 --> 00:48:57,179
I suppose not. Over.

597
00:48:57,804 --> 00:49:01,099
If you folks have any problems
up there, just give us a call.

598
00:49:01,308 --> 00:49:02,601
And, Mrs. Torrance?

599
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:07,022
It might be a good idea if you
leave your radio on all the time.

600
00:49:07,856 --> 00:49:09,358
Okay. We'll do that.

601
00:49:09,566 --> 00:49:11,610
It was real nice talking to you.

602
00:49:11,818 --> 00:49:14,446
Bye. Over and out.

603
00:49:49,356 --> 00:49:51,566
Hello, Danny.

604
00:49:56,822 --> 00:49:59,282
Come and play with us.

605
00:50:04,121 --> 00:50:06,915
Come and play with us, Danny.

606
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:10,627
Forever...

607
00:50:12,379 --> 00:50:14,131
...and ever...

608
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:17,092
...and ever.

609
00:50:48,582 --> 00:50:50,208
Tony...

610
00:50:51,209 --> 00:50:53,253
...l'm scared.

611
00:50:58,717 --> 00:51:02,304
Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.

612
00:51:03,889 --> 00:51:07,809
It's just like
pictures in a book, Danny.

613
00:51:08,018 --> 00:51:10,145
It isn't real.

614
00:51:21,823 --> 00:51:23,658
Please let me give you
some money.

615
00:51:23,867 --> 00:51:25,911
I wouldn't think of it.

616
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:27,412
Well, how can I repay you?

617
00:51:28,372 --> 00:51:30,290
It's okay. Really.

618
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:33,001
Well, I'm going to have
some coffee.

619
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:34,753
Would you like some?

620
00:51:36,463 --> 00:51:37,547
Sure.

621
00:51:37,756 --> 00:51:39,591
Great. Sit down.

622
00:51:49,518 --> 00:51:52,145
Marvelous doughnuts.
Help yourself.

623
00:51:53,814 --> 00:51:56,233
Coffee will be ready
in a few minutes.

624
00:51:59,986 --> 00:52:03,323
Can I go up to my room
and get my fire engine?

625
00:52:04,783 --> 00:52:07,494
Not right now.
Daddy's asleep.

626
00:52:08,495 --> 00:52:10,622
I won't make any noise.

627
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,959
Now come on, Doc.

628
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:15,836
He only went to bed
a few hours ago.

629
00:52:16,044 --> 00:52:17,838
Can't you wait till later?

630
00:52:18,046 --> 00:52:21,174
I won't make a sound.
I promise I'll tiptoe.

631
00:52:24,386 --> 00:52:25,679
All right.

632
00:52:25,887 --> 00:52:28,306
But really don't make a sound.

633
00:52:28,515 --> 00:52:29,975
I won't, Mom.

634
00:52:30,809 --> 00:52:32,519
Make sure you
come right back...

635
00:52:32,728 --> 00:52:34,730
...because I'm going to
make lunch soon.

636
00:52:36,857 --> 00:52:38,358
Okay, Mom.

637
00:53:27,616 --> 00:53:30,786
Can I go to my room
and get my fire engine?

638
00:53:34,539 --> 00:53:36,750
Come here for a minute first.

639
00:54:13,745 --> 00:54:15,539
How's it going, Doc?

640
00:54:20,127 --> 00:54:21,920
Having a good time?

641
00:54:24,005 --> 00:54:25,465
Yes, Dad.

642
00:54:28,343 --> 00:54:29,594
Good.

643
00:54:31,805 --> 00:54:33,974
I want you to
have a good time.

644
00:54:34,683 --> 00:54:36,309
I am, Dad.

645
00:54:46,737 --> 00:54:48,530
Do you feel bad?

646
00:54:54,494 --> 00:54:56,788
I'm just a little bit tired.

647
00:54:58,373 --> 00:55:00,917
Then why don't you
go to sleep?

648
00:55:04,504 --> 00:55:06,048
I can't.

649
00:55:07,549 --> 00:55:09,843
I got too much to do.

650
00:55:19,144 --> 00:55:21,396
Do you like this hotel?

651
00:55:27,402 --> 00:55:28,820
I do.

652
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:31,114
I love it.

653
00:55:33,325 --> 00:55:34,659
Don't you?

654
00:55:37,037 --> 00:55:38,538
I guess so.

655
00:55:41,166 --> 00:55:42,376
Good.

656
00:55:45,587 --> 00:55:47,923
I want you to like it here.

657
00:55:51,885 --> 00:55:55,263
I wish we could stay here
forever...

658
00:55:55,472 --> 00:55:57,265
...and ever...

659
00:55:57,933 --> 00:55:59,267
...and ever.

660
00:56:04,731 --> 00:56:05,732
What?

661
00:56:07,025 --> 00:56:10,112
You would never hurt Mommy or me,
would you?

662
00:56:15,617 --> 00:56:17,077
What do you mean?

663
00:56:22,207 --> 00:56:24,793
Did your mother ever
say that to you?

664
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,295
That I would hurt you?

665
00:56:28,046 --> 00:56:29,423
No, Dad.

666
00:56:31,591 --> 00:56:33,135
You sure?

667
00:56:33,677 --> 00:56:35,262
Yes, Dad.

668
00:56:40,058 --> 00:56:42,102
I love you, Danny.

669
00:56:43,311 --> 00:56:45,897
I love you
more than anything else...

670
00:56:46,106 --> 00:56:48,650
...in the whole world...

671
00:56:49,443 --> 00:56:52,487
...and I would never do anything
to hurt you...

672
00:56:52,821 --> 00:56:54,031
...never.

673
00:56:54,906 --> 00:56:56,950
You know that, don't you?

674
00:56:57,451 --> 00:56:58,994
Yes, Dad.

675
00:56:59,953 --> 00:57:01,038
Good.

676
00:58:28,959 --> 00:58:30,752
Mom, are you in there?

677
00:59:49,998 --> 00:59:51,041
What happened?

678
00:59:51,249 --> 00:59:52,501
Honey...

679
00:59:53,377 --> 00:59:54,753
...what's wrong?

680
01:00:02,928 --> 01:00:04,346
I had the most...

681
01:00:04,554 --> 01:00:07,140
...terrible nightmare I ever had.

682
01:00:09,059 --> 01:00:12,020
-It was the most horrible dream.
-It's okay, it's okay now.

683
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:14,564
Really.

684
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:20,445
I dreamed that l...

685
01:00:20,654 --> 01:00:23,073
...that I killed
you and Danny.

686
01:00:25,826 --> 01:00:28,078
But I didn't just kill you.

687
01:00:29,371 --> 01:00:32,124
I cut you up
into little pieces.

688
01:00:34,793 --> 01:00:36,336
My God.

689
01:00:37,045 --> 01:00:39,589
I must be losing my mind.

690
01:00:41,883 --> 01:00:44,511
Everything's going to be
all right.

691
01:00:46,638 --> 01:00:49,307
Come on. Let's get up
off the floor.

692
01:00:57,149 --> 01:00:59,443
There. Now sit up.

693
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:01,403
It's okay.

694
01:01:02,487 --> 01:01:03,947
It's okay.

695
01:01:07,993 --> 01:01:09,202
Danny!

696
01:01:09,494 --> 01:01:11,455
Everything's okay!

697
01:01:11,663 --> 01:01:14,791
Just go play in your room
for a while.

698
01:01:15,167 --> 01:01:17,210
Your dad's just got
a headache.

699
01:01:18,503 --> 01:01:21,548
Danny, mind what I say.
Go play in your room.

700
01:01:23,508 --> 01:01:26,470
Honey, let me just go
get him out of here.

701
01:01:26,678 --> 01:01:28,180
I'll be right back.

702
01:01:30,098 --> 01:01:32,142
Why don't you mind me?

703
01:01:38,774 --> 01:01:40,609
Oh, my God.

704
01:01:41,818 --> 01:01:44,196
What happened to your neck?

705
01:01:46,156 --> 01:01:48,283
What happened to your neck?

706
01:02:17,229 --> 01:02:19,231
You did this to him...

707
01:02:19,648 --> 01:02:21,066
...didn't you?!

708
01:02:22,901 --> 01:02:24,986
You son of a bitch!

709
01:02:25,195 --> 01:02:27,072
You did this to him!

710
01:02:27,239 --> 01:02:28,699
Didn't you?!

711
01:02:30,033 --> 01:02:31,702
How could you?!

712
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:33,662
How could you?!

713
01:04:03,543 --> 01:04:06,630
God! I'd give anything
for a drink.

714
01:04:09,257 --> 01:04:12,177
I'd give my goddamn soul...

715
01:04:12,386 --> 01:04:14,846
...for just a glass of beer.

716
01:04:29,861 --> 01:04:31,321
Hi, Lloyd.

717
01:04:34,908 --> 01:04:37,285
A little slow tonight,
isn't it?

718
01:04:42,165 --> 01:04:44,418
Yes it is, Mr. Torrance.

719
01:04:46,503 --> 01:04:47,963
What will it be?

720
01:04:49,631 --> 01:04:52,592
I'm awfully glad
you asked me that, Lloyd...

721
01:04:52,801 --> 01:04:56,138
...because I just happen to have
two twenties...

722
01:04:56,346 --> 01:04:59,266
...and two tens
right here in my wallet.

723
01:04:59,433 --> 01:05:02,728
I was afraid they were
going to be there until next April.

724
01:05:03,437 --> 01:05:05,230
So here's what:

725
01:05:05,564 --> 01:05:07,858
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...

726
01:05:08,066 --> 01:05:10,861
...a little glass and some ice.

727
01:05:11,069 --> 01:05:13,071
You can do that,
can't you, Lloyd?

728
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:15,907
You're not too busy, are you?

729
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:18,952
No, sir.
I'm not busy at all.

730
01:05:19,453 --> 01:05:21,038
Good man.

731
01:05:21,329 --> 01:05:22,414
You set them up...

732
01:05:22,706 --> 01:05:25,584
...and I'll knock them back,
one by one.

733
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:29,629
White man's burden,
Lloyd, my man.

734
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:32,007
White man's burden.

735
01:05:38,096 --> 01:05:39,222
Say, Lloyd...

736
01:05:39,431 --> 01:05:42,184
...it seems I'm temporarily light.

737
01:05:42,517 --> 01:05:44,978
How's my credit
in this joint, anyway?

738
01:05:45,228 --> 01:05:47,606
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.

739
01:05:48,315 --> 01:05:49,941
That's swell.

740
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:51,818
I like you, Lloyd.

741
01:05:52,027 --> 01:05:53,695
I always liked you.

742
01:05:53,904 --> 01:05:56,239
You were always the best of them.

743
01:05:56,448 --> 01:05:58,825
Best goddamned bartender...

744
01:05:58,992 --> 01:06:01,953
...from Timbuktu
to Portland, Maine.

745
01:06:02,162 --> 01:06:04,373
Or Portland, Oregon,
for that matter.

746
01:06:04,664 --> 01:06:06,458
Thank you for saying so.

747
01:06:08,752 --> 01:06:13,298
Here's to 5 miserable months
on the wagon...

748
01:06:13,507 --> 01:06:17,552
...and all the irreparable harm
that it's caused me.

749
01:06:35,779 --> 01:06:38,240
How are things going,
Mr. Torrance?

750
01:06:39,574 --> 01:06:42,160
Things could be better.

751
01:06:43,704 --> 01:06:46,456
Things could be
a whole lot better.

752
01:06:47,332 --> 01:06:49,668
I hope it's nothing serious.

753
01:06:52,671 --> 01:06:54,673
Nothing serious.

754
01:06:56,299 --> 01:06:58,844
Just a little problem with...

755
01:06:59,094 --> 01:07:02,222
...the old sperm bank
upstairs.

756
01:07:02,431 --> 01:07:04,766
Nothing I can't handle,
though.

757
01:07:04,975 --> 01:07:06,685
Thanks.

758
01:07:07,144 --> 01:07:08,145
Women.

759
01:07:08,353 --> 01:07:09,855
Can't live with them...

760
01:07:10,105 --> 01:07:11,898
...can't live without them.

761
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:16,695
Words of wisdom, Lloyd.

762
01:07:16,903 --> 01:07:18,363
Words of...

763
01:07:18,572 --> 01:07:20,073
...wisdom.

764
01:07:31,626 --> 01:07:34,838
I never laid a hand on him,
goddamn it.

765
01:07:35,047 --> 01:07:36,673
I didn't.

766
01:07:38,717 --> 01:07:43,305
I wouldn't touch one hair
on his goddamn little head.

767
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:47,059
I love the little
son of a bitch.

768
01:07:48,643 --> 01:07:51,480
I'd do anything for him.

769
01:07:51,688 --> 01:07:54,483
Any fucking thing for him.

770
01:07:58,570 --> 01:08:01,114
But that bitch!

771
01:08:02,157 --> 01:08:03,825
As long as I live...

772
01:08:04,117 --> 01:08:07,496
...she'll never let me forget
what happened.

773
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:19,966
I did hurt him once, okay?

774
01:08:20,342 --> 01:08:22,386
It was an accident.

775
01:08:22,678 --> 01:08:25,305
Completely unintentional.

776
01:08:26,556 --> 01:08:28,809
It could have happened
to anybody.

777
01:08:30,519 --> 01:08:33,980
And it was three goddamn
years ago!

778
01:08:34,189 --> 01:08:37,025
The little fucker had thrown all my
papers all over the floor.

779
01:08:37,234 --> 01:08:39,695
All I tried to do was pull him up.

780
01:08:42,489 --> 01:08:47,160
A momentary loss of
muscular coordination.

781
01:08:47,494 --> 01:08:48,704
I mean...

782
01:08:49,246 --> 01:08:52,791
...a few extra foot-pounds
of energy...

783
01:08:52,999 --> 01:08:55,836
...per second, per second.

784
01:09:11,935 --> 01:09:13,854
Thank God you're here.

785
01:09:17,065 --> 01:09:19,276
There's someone else
in the hotel with us.

786
01:09:19,484 --> 01:09:22,029
There's a crazy woman
in one of the rooms.

787
01:09:22,237 --> 01:09:24,781
She tried to strangle Danny.

788
01:09:27,325 --> 01:09:29,745
Are you out of your fucking mind?

789
01:09:31,663 --> 01:09:33,707
It's the truth! Really.

790
01:09:33,915 --> 01:09:35,876
I swear it.
Danny told me.

791
01:09:36,251 --> 01:09:38,086
He went up into
one of the bedrooms.

792
01:09:38,295 --> 01:09:41,757
The door was open, and he saw this
crazy woman in the bathtub.

793
01:09:41,965 --> 01:09:44,301
She tried to strangle him!

794
01:09:48,013 --> 01:09:49,765
Which room was it?

795
01:09:57,439 --> 01:09:59,566
From Channel 10 in Miami...

796
01:09:59,775 --> 01:10:02,110
...this is Newswatch
with Glen Rinker...

797
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:06,531
...Ann Bishop, and
the award-winning Newswatch team.

798
01:10:06,865 --> 01:10:09,284
Good evening. I'm Glen Rinker,
Newswatch Ten.

799
01:10:09,493 --> 01:10:12,621
As Miami continues to swelter
in a record winter heat wave...

800
01:10:12,829 --> 01:10:14,956
...bringing temperatures
to the 90s...

801
01:10:15,165 --> 01:10:18,293
...Central and Mountain states
are buried in snow.

802
01:10:18,502 --> 01:10:22,506
In Colorado, 10 inches of snow
fell injust a few hours tonight.

803
01:10:22,714 --> 01:10:24,966
Travel in the Rockies
is almost impossible.

804
01:10:25,175 --> 01:10:28,136
Airports are shut down, stranding
thousands of passengers.

805
01:10:28,345 --> 01:10:30,222
Highways are blocked
by snowdrifts.

806
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:32,182
Railroad tracks are frozen.

807
01:10:32,391 --> 01:10:34,434
Officials in Colorado
tell Newswatch...

808
01:10:34,643 --> 01:10:38,188
...at least 3 have been killed
by exposure to freezing winds.

809
01:10:38,397 --> 01:10:40,691
The governor of Colorado
is expected...

810
01:10:40,899 --> 01:10:42,651
...to declare
a weather emergency.

811
01:10:42,859 --> 01:10:44,653
The National Guard
might be called out...

812
01:10:44,861 --> 01:10:46,071
...to clear streets and roads.

813
01:10:46,279 --> 01:10:48,490
Weather forecasters
predict more snow...

814
01:10:48,699 --> 01:10:50,701
...and heavy winds
tonight and tomorrow...

815
01:10:50,909 --> 01:10:53,537
...with temperatures dropping
well below zero.

816
01:10:53,745 --> 01:10:56,748
Back here in Florida,
we've got the opposite problem.

817
01:10:56,957 --> 01:10:59,167
The heat and humidity
are supposed to climb.

818
01:10:59,376 --> 01:11:01,378
Local beaches
should bejammed.

819
01:11:01,545 --> 01:11:03,588
Our weather expert,
Walter Cronice...

820
01:11:03,797 --> 01:11:07,050
...will have the local forecast
later on Newswatch.

821
01:16:38,715 --> 01:16:43,345
We're sorry. Your call cannot
be completed as dialed.

822
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:46,807
If you need assistance,
please call the operator.

823
01:17:04,074 --> 01:17:05,909
Yes, it's me.

824
01:17:06,118 --> 01:17:07,536
Thank God.

825
01:17:12,207 --> 01:17:13,959
Did you find anything?

826
01:17:14,167 --> 01:17:16,920
No. Nothing at all.

827
01:17:17,504 --> 01:17:20,674
I didn't see one goddamn thing.

828
01:17:23,427 --> 01:17:26,930
You went into the room Danny said?
To 237?

829
01:17:27,139 --> 01:17:28,682
Yes, I did.

830
01:17:29,182 --> 01:17:30,976
And you didn't see anything at all?

831
01:17:31,184 --> 01:17:33,145
Absolutely nothing.

832
01:17:33,353 --> 01:17:34,646
How is he?

833
01:17:34,855 --> 01:17:36,648
He's still asleep.

834
01:17:37,024 --> 01:17:38,150
Good.

835
01:17:43,989 --> 01:17:47,075
I'm sure he'll be himself again
in the morning.

836
01:17:51,538 --> 01:17:54,041
Are you sure it was the right room?

837
01:17:54,249 --> 01:17:57,419
I mean, maybe Danny made a mistake.

838
01:17:57,627 --> 01:18:00,005
He must have gone in that room.

839
01:18:00,213 --> 01:18:02,841
The door was open,
the lights were on.

840
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:07,846
I just don't understand it.

841
01:18:12,184 --> 01:18:15,187
What about those bruises
on his neck?

842
01:18:17,397 --> 01:18:19,733
Somebody did that to him.

843
01:18:27,991 --> 01:18:29,409
I think...

844
01:18:31,078 --> 01:18:33,663
...he did it to himself.

845
01:18:39,670 --> 01:18:40,879
No.

846
01:18:41,588 --> 01:18:43,590
That's not possible.

847
01:18:48,929 --> 01:18:52,557
Once you rule out his version
of what happened...

848
01:18:52,808 --> 01:18:55,394
...there is no other explanation.

849
01:18:55,894 --> 01:18:57,229
Is there?

850
01:18:59,606 --> 01:19:02,484
It wouldn't be that different
from the episode...

851
01:19:02,693 --> 01:19:06,071
...that he had before
we came up here.

852
01:19:06,279 --> 01:19:07,489
Would it?

853
01:19:15,414 --> 01:19:18,417
Whatever the explanation is...

854
01:19:21,837 --> 01:19:23,255
...l think we...

855
01:19:23,463 --> 01:19:26,174
...have to get Danny out of here.

856
01:19:30,971 --> 01:19:32,806
Get him out of here?

857
01:19:36,977 --> 01:19:38,687
You mean...

858
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:41,690
...just leave the hotel?

859
01:19:50,657 --> 01:19:52,159
It is so...

860
01:19:52,325 --> 01:19:54,786
...typical of you to create
a problem like this...

861
01:19:54,995 --> 01:19:57,497
...when I finally have a chance
to accomplish something!

862
01:19:57,706 --> 01:20:00,292
When I'm really into my work!

863
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:04,463
I could really write my own ticket
if I went back now, couldn't l?

864
01:20:04,671 --> 01:20:08,383
Shoveling out driveways,
work in a car wash.

865
01:20:08,592 --> 01:20:10,677
Any of that appeal to you?

866
01:20:11,887 --> 01:20:14,598
I have let you fuck up my life
so far...

867
01:20:14,806 --> 01:20:18,435
...but I am not going to let you
fuck this up.

868
01:21:36,346 --> 01:21:38,640
Good evening. Forest Service.

869
01:21:39,224 --> 01:21:40,642
My name is Dick Hallorann.

870
01:21:40,851 --> 01:21:43,311
I'm the head chef at
the Overlook Hotel.

871
01:21:43,478 --> 01:21:45,605
Good evening.
What can I do for you?

872
01:21:45,814 --> 01:21:49,401
I've been trying to make
an urgent phone call up there...

873
01:21:49,609 --> 01:21:52,904
...but the operator said
that the phone lines are down.

874
01:21:53,113 --> 01:21:56,700
A lot of lines around here
are down due to the storm.

875
01:21:56,908 --> 01:21:59,578
I hate to put you through
any trouble...

876
01:21:59,786 --> 01:22:02,998
...but there's a family up there
all by themselves with a young kid.

877
01:22:03,206 --> 01:22:04,875
And with this storm
and everything...

878
01:22:05,083 --> 01:22:08,003
...l'd appreciate it if you'd give
them a call on your radio...

879
01:22:08,170 --> 01:22:10,172
...just to see if
everything's okay.

880
01:22:10,672 --> 01:22:12,007
I'll be glad to do that.

881
01:22:12,174 --> 01:22:15,010
Why don't you call me back
in about 20 minutes?

882
01:22:15,177 --> 01:22:17,220
Thank you very much.
I'll do that.

883
01:22:17,429 --> 01:22:18,847
All right, sir.

884
01:22:39,201 --> 01:22:41,161
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

885
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:42,829
Good evening.

886
01:23:07,396 --> 01:23:08,855
Hi, Lloyd.

887
01:23:09,064 --> 01:23:10,899
Been away, but now I'm back.

888
01:23:11,191 --> 01:23:12,901
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

889
01:23:13,568 --> 01:23:14,569
It's good to see you.

890
01:23:14,778 --> 01:23:17,447
It's good to be back, Lloyd.

891
01:23:18,073 --> 01:23:19,825
What'll it be, sir?

892
01:23:20,617 --> 01:23:22,911
Hair of the dog that bit me.

893
01:23:24,287 --> 01:23:25,956
Bourbon on the rocks.

894
01:23:26,790 --> 01:23:28,208
That'll do her.

895
01:23:41,722 --> 01:23:43,974
No charge to you, Mr. Torrance.

896
01:23:45,434 --> 01:23:47,394
No charge?

897
01:23:48,020 --> 01:23:50,022
Your money's no good here.

898
01:23:55,652 --> 01:23:57,404
Orders from the house.

899
01:24:00,615 --> 01:24:03,076
Orders from the house.

900
01:24:06,329 --> 01:24:08,332
Drink up, Mr. Torrance.

901
01:24:10,542 --> 01:24:15,088
I'm the kind of man likes to know
who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.

902
01:24:17,382 --> 01:24:20,344
It's not a matter that concerns you,
Mr. Torrance.

903
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:22,471
At least, not at this point.

904
01:24:27,267 --> 01:24:29,686
Anything you say, Lloyd.

905
01:24:30,103 --> 01:24:32,105
Anything you say.

906
01:24:45,077 --> 01:24:47,537
Oh, dear! I'm so sorry, sir.

907
01:24:48,663 --> 01:24:50,123
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

908
01:24:50,332 --> 01:24:52,876
I've made an awful mess
of your jacket, sir.

909
01:24:54,127 --> 01:24:57,756
That's all right.
I've got plenty of jackets.

910
01:24:57,964 --> 01:25:00,759
I'm afraid it's advocaat, sir.
It tends to stain.

911
01:25:00,967 --> 01:25:02,094
Advocaat, is it?

912
01:25:02,302 --> 01:25:04,471
Yes, sir.
I think the best thing...

913
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,848
...is to come along
to the gentlemen's room...

914
01:25:07,057 --> 01:25:09,601
...and we'll get
some water to it, sir.

915
01:25:10,435 --> 01:25:13,730
Looks like you might have got a
spot of it on yourself...

916
01:25:13,939 --> 01:25:14,940
...Jeevesy old boy.

917
01:25:15,148 --> 01:25:18,318
That doesn't matter, sir.
You're the important one.

918
01:25:18,610 --> 01:25:21,029
Awfully nice of you to say.

919
01:25:21,446 --> 01:25:24,324
Of course, I intended to change
my jacket this evening...

920
01:25:24,533 --> 01:25:26,785
...before the fish and
goose soiree.

921
01:25:26,993 --> 01:25:29,037
Very wise, sir. Very wise.

922
01:25:29,246 --> 01:25:30,580
Here. I'll just...

923
01:25:31,373 --> 01:25:33,625
...hold this for you there,
Jeevesy.

924
01:25:33,834 --> 01:25:35,627
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

925
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:40,298
Let's see if we can improve this
with a little water, sir.

926
01:25:40,507 --> 01:25:41,758
All right. I'll just...

927
01:25:41,967 --> 01:25:46,179
...set my bourbon and advocaat
down right there.

928
01:25:46,763 --> 01:25:48,181
Won't keep you a moment.

929
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:49,766
Fine.

930
01:25:52,853 --> 01:25:54,521
What do they call you,
Jeevesy?

931
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:57,274
Grady, sir. Delbert Grady.

932
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:02,904
Grady?

933
01:26:03,113 --> 01:26:04,448
Yes, sir.

934
01:26:05,615 --> 01:26:06,950
Delbert Grady.

935
01:26:07,117 --> 01:26:08,660
That's right, sir.

936
01:26:17,377 --> 01:26:18,795
Mr. Grady...

937
01:26:19,588 --> 01:26:21,673
...haven't I seen you
somewhere before?

938
01:26:21,882 --> 01:26:24,593
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

939
01:26:31,641 --> 01:26:33,477
It's coming off now, sir.

940
01:26:38,398 --> 01:26:39,941
Mr. Grady...

941
01:26:41,485 --> 01:26:43,945
...weren't you once
the caretaker here?

942
01:26:44,154 --> 01:26:46,948
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

943
01:26:49,993 --> 01:26:53,330
You a married man, are you,
Mr. Grady?

944
01:26:53,538 --> 01:26:54,331
Yes, sir.

945
01:26:54,539 --> 01:26:57,834
I have a wife and
two daughters, sir.

946
01:26:58,877 --> 01:27:00,379
And...

947
01:27:02,047 --> 01:27:03,340
...where are they now?

948
01:27:03,548 --> 01:27:07,594
They're somewhere around.
I'm not quite sure at the moment.

949
01:27:18,271 --> 01:27:20,691
You were the caretaker here.

950
01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:24,152
I recognize you.

951
01:27:25,529 --> 01:27:28,573
I saw your picture
in the newspapers.

952
01:27:29,032 --> 01:27:30,784
You...

953
01:27:31,243 --> 01:27:34,788
...chopped your wife and daughter
up into little bits.

954
01:27:35,288 --> 01:27:36,707
And...

955
01:27:37,332 --> 01:27:39,251
...then you blew your brains out.

956
01:27:49,177 --> 01:27:50,929
That's strange, sir.

957
01:27:51,930 --> 01:27:54,683
I don't have any recollection
of that at all.

958
01:27:58,353 --> 01:28:00,230
Mr. Grady...

959
01:28:00,647 --> 01:28:03,984
...you were the caretaker here.

960
01:28:11,783 --> 01:28:14,578
I'm sorry to differ with you, sir.

961
01:28:16,455 --> 01:28:18,165
But you...

962
01:28:18,915 --> 01:28:20,751
...are the caretaker.

963
01:28:23,003 --> 01:28:25,922
You've always been the caretaker.

964
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,635
I should know, sir.

965
01:28:32,095 --> 01:28:34,681
I've always been here.

966
01:28:52,908 --> 01:28:55,118
Did you know, Mr. Torrance...

967
01:28:55,327 --> 01:28:57,120
...that your son...

968
01:28:57,496 --> 01:29:00,207
...is attempting to bring
an outside party...

969
01:29:00,415 --> 01:29:02,626
...into this situation?

970
01:29:05,170 --> 01:29:06,880
Did you know that?

971
01:29:13,136 --> 01:29:15,222
He is, Mr. Torrance.

972
01:29:17,557 --> 01:29:18,725
Who?

973
01:29:20,977 --> 01:29:22,604
A nigger.

974
01:29:26,692 --> 01:29:28,068
A nigger?

975
01:29:30,821 --> 01:29:32,239
A nigger...

976
01:29:32,447 --> 01:29:33,532
...cook.

977
01:29:40,038 --> 01:29:41,331
How?

978
01:29:43,583 --> 01:29:45,377
Your son...

979
01:29:45,794 --> 01:29:48,588
...has a very great talent.

980
01:29:49,548 --> 01:29:53,051
I don't think you are aware
how great it is.

981
01:29:53,802 --> 01:29:57,055
But he is attempting to use
that very talent...

982
01:29:57,264 --> 01:29:59,224
...against your will.

983
01:30:07,733 --> 01:30:09,026
Well...

984
01:30:11,778 --> 01:30:14,865
...he is a very willful boy.

985
01:30:17,284 --> 01:30:19,661
Indeed he is, Mr. Torrance.

986
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:22,748
A very willful boy.

987
01:30:22,956 --> 01:30:24,291
A rather...

988
01:30:24,499 --> 01:30:26,043
...naughty boy...

989
01:30:26,251 --> 01:30:29,421
...if I may be so bold, sir.

990
01:30:36,678 --> 01:30:38,430
It's his mother.

991
01:30:40,599 --> 01:30:42,059
She...

992
01:30:42,267 --> 01:30:44,269
...interferes.

993
01:30:47,356 --> 01:30:50,442
Perhaps they need a good...

994
01:30:50,650 --> 01:30:52,277
...talking-to.

995
01:30:52,694 --> 01:30:53,528
If...

996
01:30:53,737 --> 01:30:56,490
...you don't mind my saying so.

997
01:30:57,324 --> 01:30:58,950
Perhaps...

998
01:30:59,493 --> 01:31:01,161
...a bit more.

999
01:31:04,373 --> 01:31:05,624
My girls, sir...

1000
01:31:05,832 --> 01:31:09,628
...they didn't care for
the Overlook at first.

1001
01:31:10,295 --> 01:31:14,174
One of them actually stole
a pack of matches...

1002
01:31:14,383 --> 01:31:17,052
...and tried to burn it down.

1003
01:31:18,136 --> 01:31:19,805
But l...

1004
01:31:20,013 --> 01:31:21,973
...corrected them, sir.

1005
01:31:23,308 --> 01:31:27,437
And when my wife tried to prevent me
from doing my duty...

1006
01:31:27,646 --> 01:31:28,897
...l...

1007
01:31:29,898 --> 01:31:31,983
...corrected her.

1008
01:31:46,248 --> 01:31:48,208
We have the Snowcat.

1009
01:31:51,586 --> 01:31:53,380
If the weather breaks...

1010
01:31:53,547 --> 01:31:55,340
...we might just be able...

1011
01:31:55,549 --> 01:31:57,384
...to get down the mountain.

1012
01:32:00,262 --> 01:32:03,223
I could call
the forest rangers first...

1013
01:32:03,432 --> 01:32:04,725
...and...

1014
01:32:05,058 --> 01:32:06,935
...tell them that we're coming...

1015
01:32:07,310 --> 01:32:08,478
....so that...

1016
01:32:08,687 --> 01:32:12,774
...they could start searching
for us in case we didn't make it.

1017
01:32:16,570 --> 01:32:18,697
And if Jack won't come with us...

1018
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:24,911
...l'll just have to tell him that
we're going by ourselves.

1019
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:27,080
That's all there is to it.

1020
01:32:28,457 --> 01:32:29,958
Redrum.

1021
01:32:30,917 --> 01:32:32,586
Redrum.

1022
01:32:43,847 --> 01:32:45,015
What's the matter, hon?

1023
01:32:45,223 --> 01:32:46,099
Redrum!

1024
01:32:46,308 --> 01:32:48,393
Are you having a bad dream?

1025
01:32:54,316 --> 01:32:55,567
Hon?

1026
01:33:01,365 --> 01:33:05,285
Danny's not here, Mrs. Torrance.

1027
01:33:10,290 --> 01:33:11,792
Come on, hon.

1028
01:33:12,793 --> 01:33:14,211
Wake up.

1029
01:33:15,170 --> 01:33:17,422
You just had a bad dream.

1030
01:33:18,799 --> 01:33:20,967
Everything's okay.

1031
01:33:25,013 --> 01:33:28,892
Danny can't wake up, Mrs. Torrance.

1032
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:40,153
Wake up!

1033
01:33:41,363 --> 01:33:42,656
Come on.

1034
01:33:42,864 --> 01:33:44,408
Right now.

1035
01:33:44,866 --> 01:33:46,243
Wake up!

1036
01:33:50,288 --> 01:33:54,292
Danny's gone away, Mrs. Torrance.

1037
01:34:04,428 --> 01:34:07,305
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.

1038
01:34:07,514 --> 01:34:10,434
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1039
01:34:10,726 --> 01:34:12,519
Are you receiving me?

1040
01:34:15,731 --> 01:34:19,151
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.

1041
01:34:19,526 --> 01:34:22,320
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1042
01:34:22,529 --> 01:34:24,197
Do you read me?

1043
01:34:28,577 --> 01:34:31,580
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.

1044
01:34:31,788 --> 01:34:34,374
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1045
01:34:34,583 --> 01:34:36,335
Are you receiving me?

1046
01:35:12,788 --> 01:35:14,623
Good evening. Forest service.

1047
01:35:14,831 --> 01:35:17,084
This is Dick Hallorann again.

1048
01:35:17,292 --> 01:35:20,379
I called a while ago about
the folks at the Overlook Hotel.

1049
01:35:21,630 --> 01:35:25,425
We tried to contact them several
times but they didn't answer.

1050
01:35:25,634 --> 01:35:29,221
Maybe they got their radio
turned off or they can't hear it.

1051
01:35:29,429 --> 01:35:32,307
If you'd like, I'd be glad
to try again later on.

1052
01:35:32,808 --> 01:35:34,935
That's very nice of you.

1053
01:35:35,143 --> 01:35:36,937
I'll call you back later.

1054
01:35:37,145 --> 01:35:38,146
Bye.

1055
01:36:25,235 --> 01:36:28,280
Pardon me, miss.
What time will we get to Denver?

1056
01:36:28,488 --> 01:36:30,657
We're due to arrive at 8:20, sir.

1057
01:36:30,866 --> 01:36:32,451
Thank you very much.

1058
01:37:36,348 --> 01:37:37,307
Durkin's Garage.

1059
01:37:37,474 --> 01:37:38,600
Can I speak to Larry?

1060
01:37:38,809 --> 01:37:39,810
Speaking.

1061
01:37:40,102 --> 01:37:42,604
Hi, Larry. This is Dick.
Dick Hallorann.

1062
01:37:42,854 --> 01:37:44,523
Dick! How you doing?

1063
01:37:44,731 --> 01:37:46,108
How's the weather down there?

1064
01:37:46,316 --> 01:37:49,444
I'm not in Florida.
I'm calling from Stapleton Airport.

1065
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:51,446
What are you doing there?

1066
01:37:51,863 --> 01:37:55,325
I just got in from Miami.
I got to get to the Overlook today.

1067
01:37:55,492 --> 01:37:57,119
What's the weather like there?

1068
01:37:57,786 --> 01:38:00,664
The snowplows are keeping things
moving in town...

1069
01:38:00,831 --> 01:38:02,791
...but the mountain roads
are blocked.

1070
01:38:03,333 --> 01:38:06,003
Then I'm going to need a Snowcat
to get up there.

1071
01:38:06,211 --> 01:38:08,046
Can you fix me up with one?

1072
01:38:08,255 --> 01:38:10,340
What's the big deal
about getting there today...

1073
01:38:10,549 --> 01:38:12,134
...especially in this weather?

1074
01:38:13,010 --> 01:38:16,471
Larry, just between you and me,
we got a very serious problem...

1075
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:18,890
...with the people taking care
of the place.

1076
01:38:19,099 --> 01:38:22,978
They turned out to be
completely unreliable assholes.

1077
01:38:23,186 --> 01:38:24,980
Ullman phoned me last night.

1078
01:38:25,188 --> 01:38:28,525
And I'm supposed to find out
if they have to be replaced.

1079
01:38:30,027 --> 01:38:32,029
How long will it take you
to get here?

1080
01:38:32,362 --> 01:38:34,031
About five hours.

1081
01:38:34,239 --> 01:38:36,491
I'm going to rent a car
here at the airport.

1082
01:38:36,992 --> 01:38:38,702
Okay, I'll take care of it.

1083
01:38:38,910 --> 01:38:41,747
Thanks, Larry.
I really appreciate that.

1084
01:38:41,955 --> 01:38:44,499
That's all right. Drive carefully.

1085
01:38:50,255 --> 01:38:53,550
You're with Hal and Charlie
on Radio 63, KHOW, Denver.

1086
01:38:53,717 --> 01:38:56,303
And we have a bad day out there.

1087
01:38:56,511 --> 01:38:59,890
Heavy snow throughout
the Denver metro area.

1088
01:39:00,057 --> 01:39:01,558
Many mountain passes...

1089
01:39:01,767 --> 01:39:04,644
... Wolf Creek and Red Mountain
passes are closed...

1090
01:39:04,853 --> 01:39:08,148
...and the chain law is in effect
at the Eisenhower Tunnel.

1091
01:39:08,357 --> 01:39:10,025
We hear from the news department...

1092
01:39:10,233 --> 01:39:13,403
...only a few flights are
landing at Stapleton Airport...

1093
01:39:13,612 --> 01:39:15,197
...and with storms like this...

1094
01:39:15,405 --> 01:39:19,576
...l guess the entire airport will
be closed within the hour.

1095
01:39:19,743 --> 01:39:22,579
The storm will continue through
the day and the Weather Service...

1096
01:39:22,788 --> 01:39:25,248
...has declared a stockman's
and traveler's advisory...

1097
01:39:25,457 --> 01:39:28,251
...for all areas outlying
the Denver metro region.

1098
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:29,836
Get the cows in the barn.

1099
01:39:51,316 --> 01:39:52,401
Hon?

1100
01:39:57,364 --> 01:39:59,783
Listen to me
for a minute, will you?

1101
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:07,290
I'm just going to go and
talk to Daddy for a few minutes...

1102
01:40:07,499 --> 01:40:09,543
...and I'll be right back.

1103
01:40:10,502 --> 01:40:13,046
I want you to just stay here...

1104
01:40:13,255 --> 01:40:15,757
...and watch your cartoons, okay?

1105
01:40:18,844 --> 01:40:20,345
Okay, hon?

1106
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:26,476
Yes, Mrs. Torrance.

1107
01:40:35,277 --> 01:40:36,486
All right.

1108
01:40:38,530 --> 01:40:41,450
I'll be back
in just about five minutes.

1109
01:40:42,242 --> 01:40:44,578
I'm going to lock the door
behind me.

1110
01:44:10,951 --> 01:44:12,619
How do you like it?

1111
01:44:19,251 --> 01:44:20,752
How do you like it?

1112
01:44:30,721 --> 01:44:33,390
What are you doing down here?

1113
01:44:37,769 --> 01:44:40,105
I just...

1114
01:44:40,564 --> 01:44:41,606
...wanted...

1115
01:44:42,024 --> 01:44:43,775
...to talk to you.

1116
01:44:46,153 --> 01:44:47,404
Okay.

1117
01:44:47,988 --> 01:44:49,489
Let's talk.

1118
01:44:59,291 --> 01:45:01,293
What do you want to talk about?

1119
01:45:09,176 --> 01:45:12,346
I can't really remember.

1120
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:15,307
You can't remember.

1121
01:45:16,099 --> 01:45:17,434
No...

1122
01:45:17,809 --> 01:45:19,186
...l can't.

1123
01:45:24,524 --> 01:45:27,778
Maybe it was about Danny?

1124
01:45:30,155 --> 01:45:32,824
Maybe it was about him.

1125
01:45:36,495 --> 01:45:39,790
I think we should discuss Danny.

1126
01:45:42,584 --> 01:45:44,378
I think...

1127
01:45:44,795 --> 01:45:48,548
...we should discuss
what should be done with him.

1128
01:45:53,261 --> 01:45:55,847
What should be done with him?

1129
01:46:00,852 --> 01:46:02,646
I don't know.

1130
01:46:03,146 --> 01:46:05,148
I don't think that's true.

1131
01:46:05,357 --> 01:46:07,943
I think you have some
very definite ideas...

1132
01:46:08,151 --> 01:46:09,861
...about what should be done
with Danny.

1133
01:46:10,070 --> 01:46:12,656
And I'd like to know
what they are.

1134
01:46:14,574 --> 01:46:16,368
Well, l...

1135
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:21,081
...l think maybe he should be taken
to a doctor.

1136
01:46:21,248 --> 01:46:24,584
You think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

1137
01:46:26,795 --> 01:46:30,132
When do you think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

1138
01:46:30,799 --> 01:46:32,134
As soon as possible?

1139
01:46:32,759 --> 01:46:35,095
"As soon as possible?"

1140
01:46:37,764 --> 01:46:39,182
Please.

1141
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:43,854
You believe his health
might be at stake.

1142
01:46:45,439 --> 01:46:46,940
Yes.

1143
01:46:48,316 --> 01:46:50,944
And you are concerned about him.

1144
01:46:53,488 --> 01:46:55,741
And are you concerned about me?

1145
01:46:56,575 --> 01:46:57,743
Of course I am.

1146
01:46:57,951 --> 01:47:00,162
Of course you are!

1147
01:47:00,370 --> 01:47:03,498
Have you ever thought about
my responsibilities?

1148
01:47:03,707 --> 01:47:05,208
What are you talking about?

1149
01:47:05,417 --> 01:47:08,253
Have you ever had
a single moment's...

1150
01:47:08,462 --> 01:47:10,505
...thought about
my responsibilities?

1151
01:47:10,714 --> 01:47:12,966
Have you ever thought
for a single moment...

1152
01:47:13,175 --> 01:47:15,969
...about my responsibilities
to my employers?!

1153
01:47:16,261 --> 01:47:18,096
Has is ever occurred to you...

1154
01:47:18,305 --> 01:47:21,767
...that I have agreed to look after
the hotel until May 1 st?

1155
01:47:22,017 --> 01:47:24,061
Does it matter to you at all...

1156
01:47:24,269 --> 01:47:27,356
...that the owners have placed
their complete confidence in me...

1157
01:47:27,564 --> 01:47:30,692
...and that I have signed
a letter of agreement...

1158
01:47:30,901 --> 01:47:33,487
...in which I've accepted
that responsibility?

1159
01:47:33,987 --> 01:47:35,989
Do you have the slightest idea...

1160
01:47:36,198 --> 01:47:39,451
...what a moral and ethical
principal is? Do you?!

1161
01:47:39,826 --> 01:47:42,913
Has it ever occurred to you what
would happen to my future...

1162
01:47:43,121 --> 01:47:45,540
...if I fail to live up to
my responsibilities?

1163
01:47:45,707 --> 01:47:48,001
Has it ever occurred to you?
Has it?!

1164
01:47:48,210 --> 01:47:49,753
Stay away from me!

1165
01:47:50,629 --> 01:47:51,672
Why?

1166
01:47:52,005 --> 01:47:54,966
I just want to go back to my room.

1167
01:47:55,175 --> 01:47:56,426
Why?

1168
01:47:57,052 --> 01:47:57,928
Well...

1169
01:47:59,054 --> 01:48:01,098
...l'm very confused.

1170
01:48:02,224 --> 01:48:05,894
And I just need a chance
to think things over.

1171
01:48:06,937 --> 01:48:10,899
You've had your whole fucking life
to think things over!

1172
01:48:11,066 --> 01:48:13,860
What good's a few minutes more
going to do you now?

1173
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:16,321
Stay away from me!

1174
01:48:16,655 --> 01:48:17,948
Please!

1175
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:19,783
Don't hurt me.

1176
01:48:19,992 --> 01:48:21,326
I'm not going to hurt you.

1177
01:48:21,535 --> 01:48:22,703
Stay away from me!

1178
01:48:22,911 --> 01:48:23,787
Stay away!

1179
01:48:23,996 --> 01:48:24,997
Darling.

1180
01:48:25,205 --> 01:48:26,748
Light of my life.

1181
01:48:27,207 --> 01:48:28,542
I'm not going to hurt you.

1182
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:30,711
You didn't let me finish
my sentence.

1183
01:48:30,919 --> 01:48:33,130
I said,
"I'm not going to hurt you."

1184
01:48:33,338 --> 01:48:36,091
I'm just going to bash
your brains in.

1185
01:48:36,383 --> 01:48:39,344
I'm going to bash them
right the fuck in.

1186
01:48:40,429 --> 01:48:41,972
Stay away from me!

1187
01:48:42,472 --> 01:48:43,515
Stay away from me!

1188
01:48:43,724 --> 01:48:46,101
I'm not going to hurt you.

1189
01:48:46,393 --> 01:48:47,894
Stay away from me!

1190
01:48:48,145 --> 01:48:49,229
Stay away!

1191
01:48:50,105 --> 01:48:51,314
Please!

1192
01:48:52,357 --> 01:48:54,109
Stop swinging the bat.

1193
01:48:54,317 --> 01:48:55,610
Stay away from me.

1194
01:48:56,361 --> 01:48:57,654
Put that bat down, Wendy.

1195
01:48:57,863 --> 01:48:59,364
Stop it!

1196
01:49:00,824 --> 01:49:01,950
Give me the bat.

1197
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:03,285
Please!

1198
01:49:03,535 --> 01:49:05,746
-Stay away!
-Give me the bat.

1199
01:49:05,954 --> 01:49:06,997
Stop it!

1200
01:49:07,247 --> 01:49:08,665
Give me the bat.

1201
01:49:08,999 --> 01:49:10,625
-Stay away from me.
-Stop swinging the bat.

1202
01:49:10,834 --> 01:49:12,210
Please stop!

1203
01:49:12,419 --> 01:49:13,628
Give me the bat.

1204
01:49:13,795 --> 01:49:15,047
Stay away from me.

1205
01:49:15,297 --> 01:49:17,674
-Stop it!
-Give me the bat.

1206
01:49:19,092 --> 01:49:20,093
Goddamn--!

1207
01:50:35,419 --> 01:50:37,087
What are you doing?

1208
01:50:39,923 --> 01:50:41,383
Wait a minute.

1209
01:50:42,759 --> 01:50:44,761
What are you doing?

1210
01:50:47,597 --> 01:50:48,849
What are you doing?

1211
01:51:02,738 --> 01:51:04,239
Wait a minute!

1212
01:51:06,616 --> 01:51:08,201
What are you doing?

1213
01:51:08,452 --> 01:51:10,162
Open the door!

1214
01:51:11,455 --> 01:51:12,497
Goddamn it!

1215
01:51:12,706 --> 01:51:16,251
Let me out of here!
Open the goddamn door!

1216
01:51:19,963 --> 01:51:21,214
Wendy, listen.

1217
01:51:21,631 --> 01:51:24,593
Let me out and I'll forget
the whole goddamn thing.

1218
01:51:24,801 --> 01:51:27,262
It'll be just like
nothing ever happened.

1219
01:51:41,943 --> 01:51:43,320
Baby.

1220
01:51:44,488 --> 01:51:47,824
I think you hurt my head
real bad.

1221
01:51:49,409 --> 01:51:51,078
I'm dizzy.

1222
01:51:52,079 --> 01:51:54,289
I need a doctor.

1223
01:52:01,171 --> 01:52:02,339
Honey.

1224
01:52:05,008 --> 01:52:07,344
Don't leave me in here.

1225
01:52:15,977 --> 01:52:17,854
I'm going to go now.

1226
01:52:20,941 --> 01:52:22,776
I'm going to try...

1227
01:52:22,984 --> 01:52:25,988
...to get Danny down
the Sidewinder...

1228
01:52:26,697 --> 01:52:29,032
...in the Snowcat today.

1229
01:52:31,284 --> 01:52:33,120
I'll bring back a doctor.

1230
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:40,377
I'm going to go now.

1231
01:52:47,801 --> 01:52:51,596
You've got a big surprise
coming to you.

1232
01:52:53,056 --> 01:52:55,684
You're not going anywhere.

1233
01:52:57,352 --> 01:53:01,481
Go check out the Snowcat and the
radio, and you'll see what I mean.

1234
01:53:06,111 --> 01:53:07,779
Go check it out.

1235
01:53:09,948 --> 01:53:12,117
Go check it out!

1236
01:53:15,495 --> 01:53:17,414
Go check it out.

1237
01:55:05,272 --> 01:55:07,691
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.

1238
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:10,402
Delbert Grady.

1239
01:55:11,945 --> 01:55:13,530
Grady?

1240
01:55:33,925 --> 01:55:35,761
Hello, Grady.

1241
01:55:40,432 --> 01:55:42,225
Mr. Torrance...

1242
01:55:44,144 --> 01:55:47,898
...l see you can hardly
have taken care of the...

1243
01:55:48,607 --> 01:55:51,109
...business we discussed.

1244
01:55:57,824 --> 01:56:00,786
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady.

1245
01:56:01,620 --> 01:56:05,707
I'll deal with that situation
as soon as I get out of here.

1246
01:56:06,583 --> 01:56:09,294
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance?

1247
01:56:09,795 --> 01:56:11,630
I wonder.

1248
01:56:12,798 --> 01:56:14,925
I have my doubts.

1249
01:56:16,134 --> 01:56:20,347
I, and others, have come
to believe...

1250
01:56:20,555 --> 01:56:23,558
...that your heart is not in this.

1251
01:56:24,184 --> 01:56:26,728
That you haven't the belly for it.

1252
01:56:32,901 --> 01:56:37,197
Just give me one more chance
to prove it, Mr. Grady.

1253
01:56:38,031 --> 01:56:39,992
That's all I ask.

1254
01:56:41,535 --> 01:56:45,789
Your wife appears to be stronger
than we imagined, Mr. Torrance.

1255
01:56:45,998 --> 01:56:47,457
Somewhat more...

1256
01:56:47,666 --> 01:56:49,626
...resourceful.

1257
01:56:49,876 --> 01:56:52,671
She seems to have got
the better of you.

1258
01:56:55,882 --> 01:56:58,552
For the moment, Mr. Grady.

1259
01:56:59,302 --> 01:57:01,471
Only for the moment.

1260
01:57:03,390 --> 01:57:07,519
I fear you will have to deal
with this matter...

1261
01:57:07,811 --> 01:57:11,481
...in the harshest possible way,
Mr. Torrance.

1262
01:57:12,065 --> 01:57:13,608
I fear...

1263
01:57:13,900 --> 01:57:16,445
...that is the only thing to do.

1264
01:57:19,906 --> 01:57:22,034
There's nothing
I look forward to...

1265
01:57:22,242 --> 01:57:26,121
...with greater pleasure,
Mr. Grady.

1266
01:57:27,539 --> 01:57:30,250
You give your word on that,
do you, Mr. Torrance?

1267
01:57:31,752 --> 01:57:33,754
I give you my word.

1268
01:58:45,867 --> 01:58:48,453
Redrum.

1269
01:58:49,371 --> 01:58:51,957
Redrum.

1270
02:00:59,918 --> 02:01:01,461
Danny, stop it!

1271
02:01:58,268 --> 02:01:59,728
I'm home.

1272
02:02:37,099 --> 02:02:39,935
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1273
02:03:05,502 --> 02:03:07,379
I can't get out.

1274
02:03:08,171 --> 02:03:09,297
Run!

1275
02:03:10,173 --> 02:03:11,591
Run and hide!

1276
02:03:12,134 --> 02:03:13,260
Run!

1277
02:03:13,468 --> 02:03:14,678
Quick!

1278
02:03:16,388 --> 02:03:20,934
Little pigs, little pigs,
let me come in.

1279
02:03:26,690 --> 02:03:30,068
Not by the hair
on your chinny-chin-chin?

1280
02:03:31,611 --> 02:03:33,655
Then I'll huff...

1281
02:03:33,864 --> 02:03:35,782
...and I'll puff...

1282
02:03:35,991 --> 02:03:38,035
...and I'll blow your house in!

1283
02:03:52,966 --> 02:03:54,343
Please!

1284
02:03:55,052 --> 02:03:56,845
Don't!

1285
02:03:57,512 --> 02:03:59,014
Don't!

1286
02:04:17,616 --> 02:04:18,867
Stop it!

1287
02:04:23,080 --> 02:04:24,665
