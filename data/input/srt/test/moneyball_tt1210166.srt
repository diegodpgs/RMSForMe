1
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,536
Ball one to Johnny Damon
and we are under way.

2
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,621
Damon has eight hits in 18 at bats,

3
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,291
a double, a triple, a
couple of stolen bases.

4
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,585
He had four hits in the series opener.

5
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,463
Strike.

6
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,061
Down the right-field line,
fair off the bat of Damon.

7
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,147
It rolls by Spencer.

8
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,942
And Damon will coast into second
base with a leadoff double.

9
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:17,242
Into right-center field, broken
bat, it'll fall, a base hit.

10
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,369
They wave around Damon. He will score.

11
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,830
And Jason Giambi delivers

12
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,958
with a run-scoring single
here in the opening inning.

13
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,669
And the Athletics have
taken that 1-nothing lead.

14
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,755
Go, come on, now. We gotta spin it.

15
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,181
Let's go, Yankees!

16
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:47,314
Let's go, Yankees!

17
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,649
Bases loaded.

18
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:52,861
The Yankees have the tying
run at second, down 2-nothing.

19
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:01,161
The A's are kicking it and
throwing it all over the field.

20
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:05,374
And it might lead to their elimination
if they don't get it right in a hurry.

21
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:09,211
Hammered down the
right-field line. Justice!

22
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,089
The Yankees have taken the lead.

23
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,722
They're standing,
anticipating another trip

24
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,059
to the League Championship Series.

25
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,520
The Yankees one out away.

26
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:32,568
Eric Byrnes, never with an
at bat in Yankee Stadium,

27
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,404
and they don't get much
bigger than this one.

28
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:39,158
Or more hectic when you're up
there trying to get a job done.

29
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,807
And they're a strike away.

30
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,603
And they're roaring in the Bronx.

31
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,859
Losing the first two games at
home in the best-of-five series

32
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,944
and roar back to-

33
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,758
The Yankees will defend their title.

34
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,695
It's okay, Joe, you can leave it on.

35
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,615
I don't need to watch. Joe, leave it on.

36
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:02,824
Okay.

37
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:15,003
Imagine how bad it'd be
if you were a Yankee player

38
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,506
and didn't like the taste of champagne.

39
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,217
Better ask to get traded.

40
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,804
You gotta give the Yankees-

41
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,597
- win the big game.

42
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:29,559
What a series that is
gonna be in the next...

43
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,653
You know how many kids
are wearing Giambi's

44
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:43,407
You know, Oakland Giambi's jerseys
and hats and pictures and posters?

45
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:47,035
Those same kids will be booing in
July when the Yankees come here.

46
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:51,456
Is it Giambi that's stabbing the back
or the Pinstripes on the East Coast?

47
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,167
You can't blame them for
pilfering the henhouse.

48
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,586
The henhouse is there.
I can't blame them?

49
00:04:56,754 --> 00:05:00,048
They're offering $120
million oÎ½er six years.

50
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,885
The Yankees have deeper pockets and
they're willing to give him money.

51
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,679
They're pilfering our players.

52
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:09,224
It's like we're a farm system
for the New York Yankees.

53
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,524
How are the guys doing?
That was a killer.

54
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,652
That was a killer. It's a
tough one to swallow. It's...

55
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,405
They played great. They
played their hearts out.

56
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,825
They did. They played fantastic.
It just didn't fall our way.

57
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,911
You'll do better next year.
But we were close, though.

58
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,122
We were so close. Right there.

59
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,708
Almost had it. You gotta
feel good about that.

60
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:38,086
I feel great about it.
I feel great about it.

61
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,591
Um...

62
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,135
We're not gonna do better next year.

63
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,221
Why not? Well, you
know we're being gutted.

64
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:53,352
We're losing Giambi,
Damon, Isringhausen.

65
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,104
Done deal. We're in trouble.

66
00:05:56,272 --> 00:06:00,192
You'll find new guys. You
found Jason, you found Damon.

67
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,860
I need more money, Steve. Billy.

68
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,196
I need more money. We don't have any.

69
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,948
I can't compete against $120
million with $38 million.

70
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:10,452
We're not gonna compete with
these teams that have big budgets.

71
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,288
We're gonna work within
the constraints we have,

72
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:17,209
and you're gonna do the best job
that you can recruiting new players.

73
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,628
We're not gonna pay
$17 million to players.

74
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,005
I'm not asking you

75
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,966
for 10 or 20, 30 million dollars.

76
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,927
I'm just asking for a bit of help.

77
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,764
Get me a little closer and I will
get you that championship team.

78
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:35,185
I mean, this is why I'm here.
This is why you hired me.

79
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:39,189
And I gotta ask you,
what are we doing here

80
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,983
Billy, I
- if it's not to win a championship?

81
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,570
I wanna win just as much
- That's my bar. My bar is here.

82
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,657
My bar is to take this
team to the championship.

83
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:53,620
Billy, we're a small-market team,
and you're a small-market GM.

84
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:58,667
I'm asking you to be okay not
spending money that I don't have.

85
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,336
And I'm asking you
to take a deep breath,

86
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:05,006
shake off the loss, get back
in a room with your guys,

87
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:08,718
and figure out how to find
replacements for the guys we lost

88
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,804
with the money that we do have.

89
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:16,309
I'm not leaving here. I'm not
- I can't leave here with that.

90
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,521
What else can I help you with?

91
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,076
It's a good offer, and
you gotta match it. I-

92
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,911
I need another day.

93
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,873
His mind's pretty made up. I
just think you should know that.

94
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,335
I got a call. I'll get you
back. I'll let him know.

95
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,171
Bye.

96
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,090
Yeah? Billy, Scott.

97
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,676
Just got off the phone
with Dan. You didn't.

98
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,386
I was surprised he called me.

99
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,723
Stop. I got Johnny for 7.5 or
he doesn't play anywhere else.

100
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:59,686
That's the deal you made.
Boston just upped it to 7.75.

101
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,064
You there?

102
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:08,653
We had a deal, Scott. We have
a deal, if it's 8 million.

103
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,073
Oh, man, you played me. I'm
just doing my job for my client.

104
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,910
No, you're playing me, and
you're still playing me.

105
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,662
Congratulations, asshole. You win.

106
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,714
I like guys that got a
little hair on their ass.

107
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,675
He looks like a Mantle
or a Mays, quite frankly.

108
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,595
He's got a baseball body.
Matty, who do you got?

109
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,764
I like Geronimo. Yes.

110
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,309
The guy's an athlete.
Big, fast, talented.

111
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,561
Top of my list. Clean-cut, good face.

112
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,438
Yeah, good jaw. Five-tools guy.

113
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,565
Good-looking ballplayer. Can he hit?

114
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,860
He's got a beautiful swing.
The ball explodes off his bat.

115
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,155
He throws the club head at
the ball, and when he connects,

116
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,574
he drives it, it pops off the bat.

117
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:58,036
You can hear it all over
the ballpark. A lot of pop.

118
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,288
If he's good, why doesn't he hit good?

119
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,415
He is a good hitter. He'll be ready.

120
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,293
He's gonna be a good hitter
against big-league arms?

121
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,254
Could be great. I don't think so.

122
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,715
Kid needs at bats. Give him 400
at bats, he's gonna get better.

123
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,925
He can play.

124
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,969
He's hit everywhere along the line.

125
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,720
He's one of our guys.

126
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,562
Okay, let's move on.

127
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:28,149
Artie, who do you like? I like
Perez. He's got a classic swing.

128
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,820
It's a real clean stroke. I don't
know. Can't hit the curveball.

129
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,490
There's some work to be done, I'll
admit that, but he's noticeable.

130
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,951
Got an ugly girlfriend.
What's that mean?

131
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,161
Ugly girlfriend means no confidence.

132
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,665
You are full of it. Artie is
right. This guy's got an attitude.

133
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,083
An attitude is good.

134
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,712
He walks in a room, his dick's
already been there for two minutes.

135
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,172
He passes the eye-candy
test. Got the looks.

136
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,259
He's ready to play the part.
He just needs playing time.

137
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,053
I'm just saying, his
girlfriend is a six at best.

138
00:09:57,221 --> 00:10:00,348
Look, if we're trying to replace
Giambi, this guy could be it.

139
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,892
I agree with you.
La-la-la-la-la.

140
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,355
Damn, Billy, was that a suggestion?

141
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,275
Guys, you're just talking.

142
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:14,362
Talking, "la-la-la-la-la,"
like this is business as usual.

143
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,989
It's not.

144
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,575
We're trying to solve the problem.

145
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,286
Not like this. You're not
looking at the problem.

146
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,580
We're very aware of
the problem. I mean-

147
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,249
Okay, good. What's the problem?

148
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,883
Look, Billy, we all understand
what the problem is. We have to-

149
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,801
Okay, good. What's the problem?

150
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,721
We have to replace three
key players in our lineup.

151
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,389
Nope. What's the problem?

152
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,142
We gotta replace these
guys with what we have-

153
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,019
No. What's the problem, Barry?

154
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,397
We need 38 home runs, 120
RBIs and 47 doubles to replace.

155
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,569
The problem we're trying to
solve is that there are rich teams

156
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:58,573
and there are poor teams,
then there's 50 feet of crap,

157
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,909
and then there's us.

158
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,245
It's an unfair game.

159
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:11,211
And now we've been gutted. We're
like organ donors for the rich.

160
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,422
Boston's taken our kidneys,
Yankees have taken our heart.

161
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,965
And you guys sit around

162
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:21,179
talking the same old "good body"
nonsense like we're selling jeans.

163
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,598
Like we're looking for Fabio.

164
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,850
We got to think differently.

165
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,521
We are the last dog at the bowl.

166
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,691
You see what happens to the
runt of the litter? He dies.

167
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,444
Billy, that's a very
touching story and everything,

168
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:40,031
but I think we're all very
much aware of what we're facing.

169
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,118
You have a lot of experience
and wisdom in this room.

170
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:47,455
You need to have a little faith and
let us do the job of replacing Giambi.

171
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,874
Is there another first
baseman like Giambi?

172
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,376
No, not really. No.

173
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,295
If there was, could we afford him? Nope.

174
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,966
Then what the fuck are
you talking about, man?

175
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,803
If we try to play like
the Yankees in here,

176
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,806
we will lose to the Yankees out there.

177
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,935
Boy, that sounds like
fortune-cookie wisdom to me, Billy.

178
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,647
No, that's just logic. Who's Fabio?

179
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,483
He's a shortstop. He's
a shortstop from Seattle.

180
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,278
Now, this is no time to
push the panic button.

181
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,948
Our scouts will find players,
Player Development will develop them.

182
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,492
We'll teach them to
play Oakland A baseball.

183
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,620
With all due respect, we've
been doing this a long time.

184
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:31,124
Why don't you just let us be
responsible for replacing Giambi

185
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,877
with who we know that can play?

186
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,394
Easy power. And loose.

187
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,104
Good face.

188
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,826
This son of a bitch is
going in the first round.

189
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,245
You're a premium player, Billy.

190
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:12,373
You can run, you can field,
you can throw, you can hit,

191
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,167
you can hit with power.

192
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,211
That doesn't come along very often.

193
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,713
This is Tom Martinez,
national cross-checker.

194
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,215
How you doing? Billy Beane.

195
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,382
Nice to meet you.

196
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,678
It's been a while since I've seen a
five-tool guy that can do everything.

197
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,890
I'm hopeful your interest
in professional baseball

198
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:33,770
is as strong as ours is gonna be in
getting you in this upcoming draft.

199
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,945
Mr. Beane?

200
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,739
Mark is ready to see you now.

201
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,872
How you doing? I'm fine.

202
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,082
How are you? Good.

203
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,836
Hey, Billy. Hey, Mark.

204
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,839
Good to see you. Please
sit down. You too.

205
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,926
These are the guys. Guys, Billy. Boys.

206
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,595
How's it going? All right. How you been?

207
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:11,683
You're filling out that chair nicely.
I got three weeks in it right now.

208
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:12,892
Good, good, man.

209
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,562
Yeah, man. How you doing? Fantastic.

210
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,313
Awesome. Couldn't be better.

211
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,191
That's good to hear. I'm
not gonna waste your time.

212
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,485
You just tell me what
you're looking for.

213
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,946
Fifty million dollars
in additional payroll.

214
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,573
You should try Giambi.

215
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,533
Ouch. I'm sorry. Too soon, right?

216
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,910
I want this to be a friendly meeting.

217
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,704
It's not all on your shoulders.

218
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,914
Where's Steve in this? Steve's great.

219
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,125
He's supportive in rebuilding this team.

220
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,793
That's what we're gonna do.

221
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,963
So, what are you looking
for? A left-handed reliever.

222
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,966
I'm thinking Ricardo Rincon.

223
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,302
That's not gonna happen.

224
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,597
Not even a discussion?

225
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:55,768
Billy, even if you could afford
him, respectfully, we love him.

226
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,896
We're not about to let him go.

227
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,064
You got this Venezuelan kid coming up.

228
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,567
We had him. We moved him to Detroit.

229
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,320
Huh. What else you thinking?

230
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,072
Outfielders.

231
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,950
To replace Damon? Yeah.

232
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:14,954
In your price range? No
disrespect. Enough, Mark.

233
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,457
Uh... Hollins?

234
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,584
Uh-uh.

235
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,129
Garcia? No.

236
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,006
Maybe Coste.

237
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,216
Uh-uh.

238
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,510
That's it.

239
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:34,182
All right, tell me about
Garcia. To replace Johnny Damon?

240
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,852
Mark, is he healthy?
Yeah, he's healthy-ish.

241
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,480
He had that back thing.

242
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,399
He'll be ready for spring
ball. I'll tell you what.

243
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,069
I can give you Guthrie
if you kick in some cash.

244
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,320
Mark Guthrie? Yeah.

245
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,614
How much cash? Two hundred K.

246
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,382
Okay.

247
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:12,220
So Garcia's gonna be a no.
You're kidding me, right?

248
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,473
You're kidding me. I'm not.

249
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,395
Okay. Straight up, Garcia
for Guthrie, no kicker.

250
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,065
No kicker? Straight up.

251
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:32,031
I think it's gonna be a hard no on
Garcia, but let's just keep going.

252
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,410
What else you thinking? What
are we doing? Is this business?

253
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,870
This is the way we do
business in Cleveland.

254
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,082
Hey.

255
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,794
Hello. Who are you?

256
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,632
I'm Peter Brand.

257
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,260
What do you do?

258
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,222
I'm special assistant to Mark Shapiro.

259
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,266
So, what do you do?

260
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:46,105
Mostly player analysis right now.

261
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:49,984
Been on the job long?
First job in baseball?

262
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,821
It's my first job anywhere.

263
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,449
Wow, congrats. Thank you.

264
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,243
First job. Whose nephew are you?

265
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,498
Why does Mark listen to you?

266
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,503
I don't think, uh...

267
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,005
I don't think he does very often.

268
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,342
He just did.

269
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,970
Well, in that circumstance,

270
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,682
I think he was more listening
to Bruce than myself.

271
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,685
Mm-hm. Who are you?

272
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,649
I'm Peter Brand.

273
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,696
I don't give a rat's
ass what your name is.

274
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,574
What happened in there?

275
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,994
What happened in that room?

276
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:45,123
I'm not quite sure what
you're asking me, Mr. Beane.

277
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,708
What did you tell Bruce?

278
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:53,381
I just told Bruce I like
Garcia. You like Garcia. Why?

279
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,385
Why?

280
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:05,017
I don't know. Ahem.

281
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,453
There is an epidemic
failure within the game

282
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,248
to understand what is really happening.

283
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,878
And this leads people who run
Major League Baseball teams

284
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:36,215
to misjudge their players
and mismanage their teams.

285
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,763
I apologize.

286
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,765
Go on.

287
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:53,191
Okay. People who run ball clubs,
they think in terms of buying players.

288
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:58,362
Your goal shouldn't be to buy players.
Your goal should be to buy wins.

289
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,908
And in order to buy wins,
you need to buy runs.

290
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,118
You're trying to replace Johnny Damon.

291
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,245
The Red Sox see Johnny Damon

292
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:10,082
and they see a star who's
worth $7.5 million a year.

293
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,127
When I see Johnny Damon,

294
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,630
what I see is...

295
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,468
an imperfect understanding
of where runs come from.

296
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,803
The guy's got a great glove.

297
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,932
He's a decent leadoff
hitter. He can steal bases.

298
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,476
But is he worth the $7.5 million a year

299
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,811
that the Boston Red Sox are paying him?

300
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,813
No. No.

301
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,274
Baseball thinking is medieval.

302
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,944
They are asking all the wrong questions.

303
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:42,281
And if I say it to anybody,
I'm ostracized. I'm a leper.

304
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:47,411
So that's why I'm cagey
about this with you.

305
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,621
That's why-

306
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:52,708
I respect you, Mr. Beane, and
if you want full disclosure,

307
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:57,755
I think it's a good thing that
you got Damon off your payroll.

308
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:02,468
I think it opens up all kinds
of interesting possibilities.

309
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,721
Where you from, Pete? Maryland.

310
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:09,183
Where'd you go to school?
Yale. I went to Yale.

311
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,187
What'd you study? Economics.

312
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,399
I studied economics.

313
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:24,323
Yale, economics and baseball.

314
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,119
You're funny, Pete.

315
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,226
Tell me, why Billy?

316
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,354
What is it that makes him special?

317
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:59,233
Very rare do you come
upon a young man like Billy

318
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,528
who can run, who can field,
who can throw, who can hit,

319
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,280
and who can hit with power.

320
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,491
Those five tools, you
don't see that very often.

321
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,078
Most of the youngsters
that we have an interest in

322
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,705
have one or two tools,

323
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,499
and we're hoping to
develop an extra one.

324
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,585
Your son has five.

325
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,797
We're looking at a guy that's a
potential superstar for us in New York.

326
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,841
The time is now to get him started.

327
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,844
We're prepared to make a
sizable financial commitment.

328
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,430
The Mets are gonna stand behind Billy

329
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,933
because we expect him to be
our big-league center fielder.

330
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,186
This check here represents the offer

331
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,731
that the New York Mets
would be making to Billy.

332
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:44,028
You do know that he's been accepted
to Stanford on a full scholarship?

333
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,363
I do.

334
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,948
So he can do both?

335
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:52,453
Unfortunately, he can't do
Stanford and professional baseball.

336
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:56,540
He would have to pick one or the other.

337
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,210
If he wants to be center
fielder for the Mets,

338
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,253
wants to be a baseball player,

339
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:06,300
he really needs to accept this as
life's first occupation, first career.

340
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:10,221
We're all told at some point we can
no longer play the children's game.

341
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,890
We just don't know when that's gonna be.

342
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:17,478
Some of us are told at 18, some of
us are told at 40, but we're all told.

343
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:21,315
But this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

344
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:26,070
We want you badly, and we think that this
amount of money expresses that desire.

345
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,615
Billy, this is your decision,
and whatever that decision is,

346
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,284
you know it's fine
with your mother and I.

347
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,423
Hello? Hey, it's Billy Beane.

348
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:50,010
Hey, what time is it? I don't know.

349
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:55,141
Listen, would you have
drafted me in the first round?

350
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,725
What?

351
00:23:56,893 --> 00:24:00,438
After I left, you looked
me up on your computer.

352
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,940
Would you have drafted
me in the first round?

353
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,026
I did, yeah. You were a good player.

354
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,446
Cut the crap, man.

355
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:11,532
Would you have drafted
me in the first round?

356
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,370
I'd have taken you in the
ninth round. No signing bonus.

357
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:21,709
I imagine you would've passed
and taken that scholarship.

358
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,295
Yeah.

359
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,384
Pack your bags, Pete.

360
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,846
I just bought you from
the Cleveland Indians.

361
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:51,071
Is it attached to that
clamp? Yeah, let me unhook it.

362
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,748
Slide it up right there.

363
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,166
To the left. I did.

364
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,418
Yeah, yeah. Hang on, it's wet.

365
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,170
Come on.

366
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,568
Morning, Suzanne. Coffee on? Yes.

367
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:30,778
Great.

368
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,781
Billy Beane's office. Hey.

369
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:34,949
Peter Brand. Billy.

370
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,618
How are? Hi, how you
doing? Nice to see you.

371
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,371
Good to have you here.
Boy, you move in fast.

372
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,540
Yeah, yeah. I got here
early this morning.

373
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,833
Wow. Huh.

374
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,086
All moved in. Yeah.

375
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,380
Yeah.

376
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,549
Hey, Billy,

377
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,635
I wanted you to see
these player evaluations

378
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,971
that you asked me to do.

379
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,557
I asked you to do three.

380
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,809
Yeah.

381
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,562
To evaluate three players. Yeah.

382
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,689
How many did you do?

383
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,816
Forty-seven.

384
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,277
Okay.

385
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:15,906
Actually, 51. I don't
know why I lied just then.

386
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,334
Why don't you walk me through the board?

387
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,379
Thank you.

388
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,699
Using this equation in the upper left,

389
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,994
I'm projecting that we need
to win at least 99 games

390
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,330
in order to make it to the postseason.

391
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:08,626
We need to score at least 814
runs in order to win those games

392
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,879
and allow no more than 645 runs.

393
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,302
What's this?

394
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,056
This is a code that I've written
for our year-to-year projections.

395
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,893
This is building in the intelligence
that we have to project players.

396
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,061
Okay.

397
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,897
It's about getting
things down to one number.

398
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,900
Using the stats the way we read them,

399
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,236
we'll find value in players
that nobody else can see.

400
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,075
People are overlooked

401
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:45,037
for a variety of biased
reasons and perceived flaws.

402
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,499
Age, appearance, personality.

403
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:53,420
Bill James and mathematics
cut straight through that.

404
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,300
Billy, of the 20,000 notable
players for us to consider,

405
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,011
I believe that there
is a championship team

406
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,348
of 25 people that we can afford,

407
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,685
because everyone else in
baseball undervalues them.

408
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,105
Like an island of misfit toys.

409
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,779
Billy, this is Chad Bradford.
He's a relief pitcher.

410
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:23,242
He is one of the most
undervalued players in baseball.

411
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,370
His defect is that he throws funny.

412
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:31,291
Nobody in the big leagues cares
about him because he looks funny.

413
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:34,545
This guy could be not just
the best pitcher in our pen,

414
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:38,132
but one of the most effective
relief pitchers in all baseball.

415
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,051
This guy should cost $3 million a year.

416
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,096
We can get him for 237,000.

417
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,455
Billy.

418
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:13,375
That it? Yeah.

419
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:44,865
Hey, Art.

420
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,242
Can I talk to you
before you get started?

421
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,870
I'm a bit busy right now. I know.

422
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,332
I know. Okay.

423
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,167
Morning, everyone. Art.

424
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,587
Peter Brand. Nice to meet
you. Where the hell's Pete?

425
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,838
That's Pete.

426
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,217
Grab a seat. I'll be right back.

427
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,386
All right, where did you say he's at?

428
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,638
Okay. He's on-

429
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:11,016
Who's the kid? A friend of mine.

430
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,729
I can't manage this team
under a one-year contract.

431
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,689
Well, sure you can.

432
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,527
No, I can't.

433
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,238
Okay. I gotta put a team on the field.

434
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,908
After that, I'll take a good
long look at your contract.

435
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:31,370
Deal with the manager's contract,
then put a team on the field.

436
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:35,916
At this moment, if a grounder's hit
to first, nobody's there to stop it.

437
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:41,088
It's not easy doing what I do under
the cloud of a one-year contract.

438
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,673
Okay, I understand that.

439
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,800
I've been there. I know you have.

440
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:49,429
A one-year contract means the same
thing to a manager as to a player.

441
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,765
There's not a lot of faith there.

442
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,726
Which is strange
after a 102-win season.

443
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,729
I see.

444
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:02,234
If you lose the last game of
the season, nobody gives a shit.

445
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:08,115
So it's on me now? No, Art, it's on me.

446
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,618
And the kid is the new assistant GM.

447
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,787
Okay. Okay, fellas.

448
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,622
Hey, Billy.

449
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,719
You can't deny his offensive
output. He can play.

450
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,889
And we need people that can play.

451
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,480
Who do you wanna talk about first?

452
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,249
None of them.

453
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,961
Billy, we got 38 home runs,
120 RBIs to make up for.

454
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,505
Guys, you're still
trying to replace Giambi.

455
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:09,176
I told you we can't do
it, and we can't do it.

456
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:13,931
Now, what we might be able
to do is re-create him.

457
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,100
Re-create him in the
aggregate. The what?

458
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,020
Giambi's on-base percentage was. 477.

459
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:24,650
Damon's on-base,.324.
And Olmedo's was. 291.

460
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,027
Add that up and you get...

461
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,989
Do you want me to speak?

462
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,867
When I point at you, yeah.

463
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,036
1.092. Divided by three.

464
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,915
.364. That's what we're looking for.

465
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:44,211
Three ballplayers
- Three ballplayers whose average OBP is...

466
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,712
.364.

467
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,757
Wait, that doesn't come out
right. It's right, Artie.

468
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,218
Billy. You gotta carry the one.

469
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,762
Billy. Scratch this out.

470
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,013
Yeah?

471
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,765
Who's that?

472
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,558
That's Pete.

473
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,062
Does Pete really need to be here?

474
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,230
Yes, he does.

475
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,234
Okay, here's who we want.

476
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,654
Number one: Jason's
little brother, Jeremy.

477
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,699
Oh, God. Billy, that's trouble.

478
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:18,745
Billy, look, if I
- Yeah. Billy, if I may, he's had his problems off the field,

479
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,248
and we know what he
can't do on the field.

480
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,333
He's getting thick around the waist.

481
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,169
There's reports about him
on weed, in strip clubs.

482
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:29,006
His on-base percentage is
all we're looking at now.

483
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:34,594
And Jeremy gets on base an awful
lot for a guy who only costs 285,000.

484
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,764
Jeez, Billy
- Number two:

485
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,268
David Justice. Oh, no.

486
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,311
His legs are gone. Not a good idea.

487
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,105
Old Man Justice? Why is that?

488
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:50,402
Steinbrenner's so pissed at his decline, he's
willing to eat his contract to get rid of him.

489
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,280
Exactly. Ten years
ago, Justice, big name.

490
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,489
Been in big games.

491
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:57,909
He's gonna really help our
season tickets early in the year,

492
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:02,706
but in the dog days in July, August,
we're lucky if he's gonna hit his weight.

493
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,543
Billy, his legs are gone, and
he's a defensive liability.

494
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,879
I question whether
the bat speed's there.

495
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,505
His legs are gone. Grady.

496
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:14,593
We'll be lucky to get 60 games
out of him. Why do you like him?

497
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:16,970
Because he gets on base.

498
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,557
What is this? What are we doing?

499
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,809
Okay, number three:

500
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,567
Scott Hatteberg. Who?

501
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,818
Hatteberg? Exactly.

502
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,820
He sounds like an Oakland A already.

503
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:37,991
Yes, he's had a little problem with
- Little problem? He can't throw.

504
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,828
He's a career. 260 hitter. The
best part of his career is over.

505
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,790
It's just getting started.
Boston wants to cut him.

506
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,501
No one wants to pick
him up. Good. He's cheap.

507
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:50,337
Let me get this straight.
You're gonna get a guy

508
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,840
that's been released by half
the organizations in baseball

509
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:58,178
because he's got nonrepairable nerve
damage in his elbow and can't throw.

510
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,681
He can't throw and he can't
field. But what can he do?

511
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:02,891
Oh, boy.

512
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,477
Check your reports or
I'm gonna point at Pete.

513
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,146
He gets on base. He can get on base.

514
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,899
So he walks a lot. He
gets on base a lot, Rocco.

515
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,693
Do I care if it's a walk or a hit?

516
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,237
Pete?

517
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,656
You do not. I do not.

518
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,867
I got 37 free agents that are
better than those three guys.

519
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,286
Wait a minute, let me get this straight.

520
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,123
So you're not gonna bring in one

521
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,626
but three defective
players to replace Giambi?

522
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,796
You're not buying into
this Bill James bullshit?

523
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,965
This is the new direction of the A's.

524
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,051
We are card counters
at the blackjack table

525
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,929
and we're gonna turn
the odds on the casino.

526
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,015
I don't see it. Seriously, guys.

527
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,893
I think we have to
remember this is the man.

528
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:52,482
He answers to no one
except ownership and God.

529
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,527
And he doesn't have to answer to us.

530
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,113
We make suggestions, he makes decisions.

531
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:01,700
That's all fine and well, but
we've been working our asses off

532
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:05,704
for weeks to make this club better,
and you're shitting all over it.

533
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,373
This is not a discussion.

534
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,085
What are we discussing?

535
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,087
Barry, not a discussion.

536
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,970
Billy, man, um,

537
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,681
there's one thing you're forgetting.

538
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:30,020
None of those three guys
knows how to play first base.

539
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,522
Well, you're gonna have
to teach one of them.

540
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,107
Teach?

541
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,943
Which one?

542
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:52,584
This is really the kickoff to the
holiday season here in downtown Seattle.

543
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:57,130
It took weeks of planning to lead up to
the big event, but it was well worth it.

544
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:00,759
The weather was ideal. People
are still having a great time.

545
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,802
Thousands of people were out earlier.

546
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,638
We have a nice recap for you

547
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:08,308
of all the great events taking
place downtown in Seattle-

548
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,980
Hello? Scott?

549
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,148
Yes.

550
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,318
It's Billy Beane of
the Oakland A's. Yes.

551
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,363
Can we talk? Uh, yeah.

552
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,490
Do you wanna let us in?

553
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,035
Pardon me? We're out front.

554
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,664
What? On the curb.

555
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,624
Uh, yeah, yeah.

556
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:35,627
Honey?

557
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,008
Oh, thank you. Thank you, ma'am.

558
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,843
Very kind.

559
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,182
How's the elbow, Scott?

560
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:53,395
You know, it's good. It's
really good. It's great. Uh...

561
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,361
I can't throw the ball at all. Yeah.

562
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,239
You've thrown your last
ball from behind home plate.

563
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,616
That's what I'd say. Well...

564
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:10,620
Good news is, we want you at first.

565
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,464
We want you to play first
base for the Oakland A's.

566
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,843
Okay, well,

567
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,761
I've only ever played catcher.

568
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,389
Scott, you're not a catcher anymore.

569
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,893
If you were, our call wouldn't
have been the only one you got.

570
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:38,982
Yeah. Hey, listen, no, I
appreciate it. You're welcome.

571
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:43,903
But the thing is, is... You
don't know how to play first base.

572
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,572
Scott. That's right.

573
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,657
It's not that hard, Scott.

574
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,035
Tell him, Wash. It's incredibly hard.

575
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:53,371
Hey, anything worth doing
is. And we're gonna teach you.

576
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,874
Wait a minute here.
I mean, but what about

577
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,168
Jason's gone, Scott.

578
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,171
You want me to take
Giambi's spot at first base?

579
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,589
Yeah. What about the fans?

580
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:06,259
Maybe I can teach one of them. The fans don't
- Good one.

581
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,802
Fans don't run my ball club.

582
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,180
Honey, what are you doing awake?

583
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,932
Sweetheart, can you...?

584
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,894
That's my daughter.

585
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,230
You got kids?

586
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,025
Uh, yeah, a daughter.

587
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:26,613
Scott, this is a contract to
play ball for the Oakland A's.

588
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,865
A copy's been sent over to your agent.

589
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,910
Discuss with your wife, let us know.

590
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,162
Thank you.

591
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,622
Bye-bye. Bye.

592
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,791
Oh, and, Scott. Yeah?

593
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,001
Don't tell anyone about
the first-base thing.

594
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,461
Yes, sir. Okay.

595
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,130
Happy holidays. All right.

596
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,990
Hey, Sharon. Hi, Billy.

597
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:14,411
Is she ready? She's out with friends.

598
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,622
But she'll be back. Come in.

599
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,667
Okay. Yeah, she's right here. Hold on.

600
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,168
Here you go.

601
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:27,924
Here, wanna have a seat? Yeah.

602
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,852
You good, Billy? Yeah.
How are you, Alan?

603
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:42,397
Good. Really good. Things
are peaceful around here.

604
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,526
It's good to see you.

605
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,653
Thanks, Alan.

606
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,947
I haven't got to see
you since play-offs.

607
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,616
I wanted to say that New
York was heartbreaking.

608
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,660
I'm sure for you too.

609
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:59,789
Not many teams make it that far,
and to watch you go that far was-

610
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:05,462
It was really an accomplishment.
Well, that's nice.

611
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,548
How is the team shaping up?

612
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:12,469
Team's good. Rebuilding. Good.

613
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,722
I read you lost Giambonni and Damon.

614
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,890
Giambi. Giambi.

615
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,726
Yeah. Damon, Isringhausen.

616
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:23,897
They're really? They're
gone? Gone. Yesterday's news.

617
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:27,442
That's terrible. No, but
that is a tough situation.

618
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,235
That's...

619
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:32,780
You're gonna be fine, though.
You always figure something out.

620
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,913
Where is she? Where was
she? Down the street or...?

621
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,083
Oh, sorry, yeah. I just talked to her
on her cell. She's coming up the hill.

622
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,543
Okay.

623
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,921
She's got a cell phone?

624
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:51,007
Yeah. A
12-year-old?

625
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,675
Yeah.

626
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,677
Huh.

627
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:56,763
For emergencies.

628
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,934
Big parenting decision.

629
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:05,563
But it's something that, you know,
we, you know, all should discuss,

630
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:09,192
because if you have any
objections, of course...

631
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,819
Her mother and I will discuss it.

632
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,405
But thank you.

633
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,702
Any of these? Um...

634
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,371
I don't know.

635
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,581
Do you? This one's cool.

636
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,291
Is that good or bad?

637
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,377
Butterflies. They're okay.

638
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,505
Look, that one's pretty. I like the red.

639
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,298
Should we try?

640
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,300
No?

641
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,094
Oh, I like this one. Yeah?

642
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,637
Dad, look at this one.

643
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,098
Look how it's red. It's beautiful.

644
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,642
This one's pretty. Let's try it out.

645
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,186
Just right here? Why
don't we go over there?

646
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,896
Can we go over there?

647
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:09,502
Oh, honey, you need to
sing. That's so good.

648
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,338
That's beautiful.

649
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:14,924
Sometimes I sing.

650
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:20,763
It's fun to sing with your song, but
I don't want people to listen to me.

651
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:24,809
Well, honey, I think people would love
to listen to you. That's beautiful.

652
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,896
Would you sing a little for your dad?

653
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:31,190
Right here in the middle of the store?

654
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,446
Little bit. Little bit.

655
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,907
You ready? I'm ready.

656
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,326
Okay.

657
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:44,329
I'm just a little bit
Caught in the middle

658
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:47,206
Life is a maze And love is a riddle

659
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:51,711
I don't know where to go
Can't do it alone, I've tried

660
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,546
And I don't know why

661
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,299
I'm just a little
girl Lost in the moment

662
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,552
I'm so scared But I don't show it

663
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,889
I can't figure it out
It's bringing me down

664
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:07,477
I know I've got to let it go

665
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,563
And just enjoy the show

666
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:19,030
Billy Beane was taken in the
first round of the amateur draft.

667
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,449
I think this is a steal,
to get Billy Beane.

668
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,159
He's young, he's talented.

669
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:27,664
A true five-tool player with speed.
This guy is a can't-miss prospect.

670
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,083
This is a great sign
for the New York Mets.

671
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,711
And it could be the turnaround
that they've been looking for.

672
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,588
Ball one.

673
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,299
I'll take Billy Beane over Strawberry.

674
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:41,886
Billy Beane, an interesting
pick, turned down a scholarship.

675
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,596
He could've gone to Stanford.

676
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:47,100
Sometimes you don't find out
till you get to the big leagues...

677
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:48,267
Strike!

678
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:51,896
This guy has never failed at anything.
He's coming out of high school.

679
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,692
Billy was gonna go to college. He
could've been a great quarterback.

680
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,410
Strike three.

681
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:09,247
There's not an organization in baseball

682
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:14,252
who would not have taken
a chance on this young guy.

683
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:19,215
He didn't pan out.
That happens every year.

684
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,511
Some do, some don't.

685
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:27,724
I mean, if you're having any
doubt at all about this...

686
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:31,644
Having the scholarship...

687
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:34,897
Your son was born with
a God-given ability.

688
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:39,277
Few scouts can go into
the mind of a young man

689
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:44,115
and determine whether he's really
confident about what he can do.

690
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,992
A very special player.

691
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,786
So you can sign him
based on his ability,

692
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:52,498
but then he's gotta be
successful to be confident.

693
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:57,336
And once he becomes confident,
that's when you've got something.

694
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:04,010
You make a decision on what you see.

695
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:07,722
And if things don't
pan out, you move on.

696
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,932
That's baseball.

697
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,143
Many are called, few are chosen.

698
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:18,775
Billy, that is Kevin Youkilis.
That is the Greek God of Walks.

699
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,276
That's my hero.

700
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,446
That man gets walked more
than anybody in baseball

701
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,531
except for Barry Bonds.

702
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:29,202
I tried to convince Shapiro
to pick him up last June,

703
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,746
but he said he waddled like a duck.

704
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,457
Yeah, Boston snagged him.

705
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,542
I think they wanna wait and see.

706
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:46,719
Are you okay, Billy? Billy?

707
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,721
Can we talk?

708
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,516
Yeah. Yeah.

709
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,695
You're unhappy, Grady. Why?

710
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:09,992
Wow.

711
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,912
May I speak candidly? Sure, go ahead.

712
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,958
Major League Baseball and its fans,
they're gonna be more than happy

713
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,585
to throw you and
Google Boy under the bus

714
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,754
if you keep doing what you're doing.

715
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,298
You don't put a team
together with a computer.

716
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:26,217
No? No.

717
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:29,095
Baseball isn't just
numbers. It's not science.

718
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:32,431
If it was, anybody could do
what we're doing, but they can't.

719
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,350
They don't know what we know.

720
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,603
They don't have our
experience and our intuition.

721
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,230
Okay.

722
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:43,276
You got a kid in there that's got
a degree in economics from Yale.

723
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:46,612
You got a scout here with 29
years of baseball experience.

724
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,365
You're listening to the wrong one.

725
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:53,369
Now, there are intangibles that
only baseball people understand.

726
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,789
You're discounting what
scouts have done for 150 years?

727
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:59,000
Even yourself?

728
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,836
Adapt or die.

729
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,966
This is about you and
your shit, isn't it?

730
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,051
Twenty years ago, some
scout got it wrong.

731
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:12,889
Whoa. Okay. Okay. Now you
declare war on the system.

732
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:17,768
Okay, okay, my turn. You
don't have a crystal ball.

733
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:21,522
You can't look at a kid and predict
his future any more than I can.

734
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,983
I've sat at those
kitchen tables with you

735
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:27,153
and listened to you tell
parents, "When I know, I know.

736
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,322
And when it comes to your son, I know. "

737
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,949
And you don't.

738
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,328
You don't.

739
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:40,291
Okay. I don't give a
shit about friendship,

740
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,002
this situation, or the past.

741
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:46,797
Major League Baseball thinks the
way I think. You're not gonna win.

742
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:49,550
And I'll give you a nickel's
worth of free advice.

743
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,011
You're never gonna get another job

744
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,765
after this catastrophic season
you're about to set us all up for.

745
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,934
You'll have to explain to your kid

746
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,645
why you're working at
Dick's Sporting Goods.

747
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,861
I'm not gonna fire you, Grady.

748
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:15,868
Fuck you, Billy. Now I will.

749
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:21,624
Good luck, Art.

750
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:30,800
Kubota. You never played ball, right?

751
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,803
I played a little T-ball.
You're the new head scout.

752
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,680
Congratulations.

753
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:46,440
So Boston's gonna wait and see?

754
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,402
Yeah.

755
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:53,239
Yeah. It's just you and me, Pete.

756
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,157
And we're all in.

757
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,956
It sounds like you're apologizing
for what they're doing.

758
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:04,834
I'm not. I just don't
know what you're gonna do

759
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:08,379
with the budget that the A's
have. Who are you gonna get?

760
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,715
I'm looking at the
spring-training roster.

761
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,591
You gotta be kidding me. How so?

762
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,260
He looked like a clown out there.

763
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,595
Who? Chad Bradford.

764
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,639
Tell me about Bradford.

765
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,267
I like him a little bit,
but he's a specialist.

766
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:24,478
He's not a guy that you say,
"The eighth inning is yours,

767
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,480
lefties vs. righties. "

768
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:28,315
In my opinion.

769
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:32,445
I don't know what Billy Beane and
management understands about him.

770
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:36,240
He only throws the ball about 82, 83
miles an hour. There must be something-

771
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,868
He is a freak, and not in a good way.

772
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,411
Let me ask you this.

773
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,039
Talking about trying to win a division.

774
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,958
We're counting on David
to be the guy he was.

775
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,627
I have my doubts. He's gotten old.

776
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:52,298
That's why he's not in New York
anymore, not in Cleveland anymore.

777
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:55,801
We paid him the money we should've
been giving to Johnny Damon.

778
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,636
Hey. Jeremy Giambi.

779
00:50:57,804 --> 00:51:00,014
That's the one to worry about.

780
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:02,975
He gets comps up and down
Vegas more than in Oakland.

781
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,478
That should tell you
something right there.

782
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,688
Isn't that the deal with these guys?

783
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,231
He has one good year.

784
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:13,069
And he gets a huge offer
and then he gets traded.

785
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:18,574
Bob. Harder. Hatteberg.

786
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:24,914
Good. Good.

787
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:28,000
Billy, we have to talk about Hatteberg.

788
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,628
Go. There's just no feel for the spot.

789
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:34,340
I think it's a long shot that he
can be a big-league first baseman.

790
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,802
It's day one of the first
week. You can't judge this yet.

791
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,553
No, I think we can judge it.

792
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:44,016
I mean, I like him, you
know, but I can judge him.

793
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,810
First base is the moon to him.

794
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:49,855
It wasn't to Giambi. Giambi's the
worst first baseman in baseball.

795
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:53,526
Gonna compare him to Giambi?
What are we talking about?

796
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:54,985
All right.

797
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:58,280
What do you think, Wash?

798
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:02,284
The nice way to say it
is he lacks confidence.

799
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,953
Well, give him some.

800
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:07,248
I'll do that, but we got
Pena, who can play first.

801
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,834
And he's looking mighty good out there.

802
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,711
We wanna go with Hattie.

803
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,301
We got six weeks.

804
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,761
Get down in it.

805
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,853
There you go. Scotty H.

806
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,689
That's what I'm talking
about. Picking machine.

807
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:34,191
It's only baseball.

808
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:42,408
This better work.

809
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,661
I'm just kidding you.

810
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:58,924
Don't stop believin'

811
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,969
ALL Let's go, Oakland!

812
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,929
Let's go, Oakland!

813
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,681
Streetlight

814
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:10,269
What is wrong with this
thing? It's a dollar, man.

815
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,855
What? Welcome to Oakland, D.J.

816
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,065
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

817
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:19,069
I think this year, we're gonna
show that it takes a team to win,

818
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,405
not any individual guy, just a team.

819
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:24,950
And I think we got a
hell of a ball club here.

820
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:27,161
Chad, are you intimidated at all today?

821
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:32,541
I wouldn't say I'm intimidated, really.
I'm just really excited, like you said.

822
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:36,212
Jeremy, how's the team gonna
fare without your brother, Jason?

823
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:39,089
Well, you know, the
organization did a great job

824
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:41,967
of bringing in good young
guys to fill that role.

825
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,553
Let's face it, they're
getting a deal with you.

826
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,972
The Yankees are paying
Jason a lot of money.

827
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,226
You are coming here on a dime.
How does that make you feel?

828
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,311
I feel good. Um...

829
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:55,481
How are the nerves in
your fingers? You know.

830
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,691
Gotta start with the age, 36 years old.

831
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:00,110
How do you think your
body's gonna hold up?

832
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:03,489
You spend a lot of time
at strip clubs, partying.

833
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,242
Do you resent the attention
you get off the field?

834
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,451
I love it.

835
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,828
You spend a lot of time in Vegas. I do.

836
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:14,208
I feel great. I did a lot of work to get
- Excuse me. Get out of my shot.

837
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,417
Sorry, go ahead.

838
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,711
There have been questions about my age

839
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:21,632
and my declining skills, some say,
but I'm here to prove that wrong.

840
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,509
I asked if you were 100 percent.

841
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:34,353
Excuse me, Mr. Beane? Hey, Chad.

842
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,815
Hey, I'm not disturbing you,
am I? Not at all. What's up?

843
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:41,068
I wanted to say thank
you for this opportunity.

844
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:44,697
Well, we enjoy having you. It's
gonna work out well for all of us.

845
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:48,784
I appreciate it, sir. Nobody's ever
given me a chance like this before.

846
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,452
Nobody?

847
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,622
Well, just you, sir.

848
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,543
Well, it's a big day,
one you won't forget.

849
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,878
Appreciate it. And I wanna let you know

850
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:02,881
I'm gonna be praying
for you and your family.

851
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,217
No problem.

852
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:09,430
Well, here we are just minutes
away from the season opener of 2002

853
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:10,806
for the Oakland A's.

854
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,683
The first pitch is moments away.

855
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,977
We'll come back with
the national anthem.

856
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,562
Opening day is upon us.

857
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:20,566
All right, fellas, smile. Here we go.

858
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:25,070
Hey, she give me love
And I feel all right now

859
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:30,909
I'm going in. Text
me the play-by-play.

860
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,661
What? Why?

861
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,539
I don't watch the games.

862
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,674
Detail, halt!

863
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,928
And forward face!

864
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:53,158
That's the third Ranger
batter to be hit today.

865
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:56,662
Twice Alex Rodriguez
was nicked. The ninth-

866
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:35,701
I should've made you a bigger part
of the conversation from day one.

867
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,870
It'd be clear what we're trying to do.

868
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,998
That was my mistake, Art. I
take responsibility for that.

869
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,833
What are you trying to say?

870
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:47,713
Doesn't matter what moves I make if you don't
play the team the way they're designed to be.

871
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,842
Billy, you're out of your depth.

872
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:56,054
Why not Hatteberg at first?
Because he can't play first.

873
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:58,640
How do you know? Not
my first baseball game.

874
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:01,518
Scott Hatteberg can't
hit. He gets on base.

875
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:05,063
Still keeps us in the plus column.
We need to be seven over. 500.

876
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,815
What?

877
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,362
Anything else?

878
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:16,783
Yeah. I would've rather seen
Bradford in the end than Magnante.

879
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,452
Bradford's a righty.

880
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,747
I don't care about righty-lefty. I do.

881
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:29,505
Could this be about your contract? No.

882
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:34,051
This is about you doing
your job and me doing mine.

883
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,761
Mine's me being left alone

884
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,847
to manage this team
you assembled for me.

885
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:42,100
I didn't assemble them
for you, Art. No shit.

886
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,444
Good meeting.

887
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:53,737
Every time we talk,

888
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:56,698
I'm reinvigorated by
my love of the game.

889
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:23,475
HOST We got Grady Fuson, former
head of scouting with the Athletics.

890
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:26,436
And, Grady, can you interpret
for us what's going on?

891
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:28,772
They call it Moneyball. Moneyball?

892
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:33,485
Yes, and it was a nice theory,
and now it's just not working out.

893
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:37,656
Billy Beane has built this team
on the ideas of a guy, Bill James,

894
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:42,494
who wrote an interesting
book on baseball statistics.

895
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:46,665
The problem is that Bill James
never played, never managed.

896
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:51,420
He was in fact a security guard
at a pork-and-beans company.

897
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,256
Do you see this as a
decimation of the organization?

898
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,091
He bought a ticket on the Titanic.

899
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,301
Oh, boy.

900
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:59,511
He's tried to come up
with a new approach.

901
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,764
My hat's off to him. It won't work.

902
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:06,560
One-two pitch. Tejada strikes out.

903
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:07,894
And that is the game.

904
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:11,148
The Seattle Mariners win both
games on this series, Ray.

905
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:14,860
They've won 10 in a
row. Seattle is 13 and 3.

906
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,865
I can't watch this shit.

907
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:22,534
Go on the road with the team.

908
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:24,911
You don't go on the road with the team.

909
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:28,707
That's why I want you
to do it. Why don't you?

910
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:33,045
I can't develop personal
relationships with these guys.

911
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:35,756
I gotta be able to trade
them, send them down,

912
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:37,758
sometimes cut them.

913
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:42,888
Which is something you should
learn to do, by the way.

914
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:48,644
I would never have to cut
a player, unless you...

915
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:52,397
Oh, come on. "Come on" what?

916
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:55,067
Let's practice. No.

917
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:58,111
Yeah. I'm a player. You
gotta cut me from the roster.

918
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,321
No. Go.

919
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:00,947
What do you mean, no? No.

920
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:02,741
Do it. This is stupid.

921
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,327
Part of the job, man.

922
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,249
Fine.

923
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:16,046
Billy, please have a seat. I
need to talk to you for a minute.

924
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:17,756
Go on.

925
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:21,176
You've been a huge part of this team.

926
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:24,137
But sometimes you have to
make decisions for the team.

927
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:25,931
I'm sure you can understand.

928
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:29,101
You're cutting me? I'm really sorry.

929
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:31,436
I just bought a house here.

930
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:33,271
Well... In Oakland.

931
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,610
Well, uh... Well...

932
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:42,030
"Well... Well... "?
That's all you got to say?

933
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,574
My kid just started a new school.

934
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:48,078
They made friends. That's, uh...

935
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:51,456
You shouldn't pull them out
in the middle of the year.

936
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:54,459
You should wait. What the
hell are you talking about?

937
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,461
I don't know. I shouldn't have-

938
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:59,131
I'm not gonna do this.
I think this is stupid.

939
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:02,467
I'm not gonna fire
anybody, and this is dumb.

940
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:06,805
They're professional ballplayers.
Just be straight with them.

941
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,932
No fluff, just facts.

942
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:13,937
Pete, I gotta let you go. Jack's
office will handle the details.

943
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:19,067
That's it? Pfft.

944
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,318
Really?

945
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:24,906
You rather get a bullet to the head or
five to the chest and bleed to death?

946
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:29,161
Are those my only two options?

947
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,496
Go on the road with the team.

948
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,751
Okay.

949
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,636
Say, bro.

950
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:48,847
Let me ask you a question. Yeah.

951
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:51,850
How come your boss doesn't
travel with the team?

952
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:57,314
He doesn't like to
mingle with the players.

953
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:01,693
Is that supposed to
make us easier to cut?

954
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:09,034
I don't know. I don't know.

955
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:14,039
And how come soda is a
dollar in the clubhouse?

956
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:16,458
I never seen nothing like that.

957
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:20,545
Billy likes to keep
the money on the field.

958
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:22,589
Soda money?

959
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,591
Really?

960
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:28,512
Where on the field is the
dollar I'm paying for soda?

961
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:33,558
It's hard to see exactly,

962
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:36,686
but it's there, yeah.
Yeah, it is hard to see.

963
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:38,897
I'm done.

964
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:52,786
Hey, Dad. Hi, honey.

965
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,955
How are you? I'm good.

966
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:57,249
Was it bumpy? It was okay.

967
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,379
So with this loss tonight,
the Oakland Athletics

968
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:07,634
incredibly, have lost 14
of their last 17 games.

969
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:10,887
They are 10 games back in
the American League West.

970
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:13,557
Is it fair to say the
experiment has failed?

971
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:16,059
Well, absolutely. It was predictable.

972
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:20,689
You don't wish anybody a lack of success,
but the facts are in front of you.

973
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,691
You can't blame Art Howe.

974
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:23,900
No.

975
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:28,196
The fact of the matter is, this is not
about statistics, this is about people.

976
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:31,116
Art Howe is not the problem.

977
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:35,203
The problem is in the general
manager's office with Billy Beane.

978
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:38,039
The root of the problem
for me is philosophical.

979
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:40,375
I said it before. This
is fantasy baseball.

980
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,335
Billy is just not thinking.

981
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:45,130
Start thinking about a
new GM, making changes.

982
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:46,882
He never goes to the games.

983
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:48,508
This was very predictable.

984
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:51,303
He needs to look at what's going on.

985
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:54,931
The man needs to get real.
I want Billy Beane gone.

986
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:57,559
Calling for Beane's head.
I want your thoughts.

987
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:02,939
The past 18 games, they've been shut
out or scored one run four times.

988
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:04,816
They're just not scoring enough.

989
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:08,153
It's not just the offense, not
Thad Bosley and the hitters.

990
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:12,616
It's everything. If there was one thing
you could pick out, you'd try to fix it,

991
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:18,121
but just everything
is in a funk right now.

992
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:25,295
What the hell am I doing?

993
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:30,425
Oh, man.

994
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,594
Look, Steve.

995
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:38,266
I believe in what we're doing.

996
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:41,311
The record doesn't reflect
the strength of this team

997
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:44,189
or where we're gonna be
at the end of the season.

998
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:48,985
Now, Pete and I here feel very strongly
that we stay on the track we've chosen.

999
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:51,696
Our sample size has
been too small. It's too-

1000
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,531
Early. It's still early.

1001
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,285
Where do we expect to
be by the All-Star break?

1002
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,956
Our goal and our expectation

1003
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:04,876
is by mid-July to be
within seven games of first.

1004
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,503
That would be this working.

1005
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:09,172
That keeps us in the
hunt. Exceptionally well.

1006
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:12,592
By July. July.

1007
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:16,638
And what's gonna prevent
you from accomplishing that?

1008
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:18,473
What are you afraid of?

1009
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,559
Nothing. That's why we're here, Steve.

1010
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:25,063
That's why we get up in the
morning. That's all we do.

1011
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,167
More? Yeah, a little more.

1012
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:49,796
Don't tell your mother. I won't.

1013
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:52,674
Chocolate sauce? Yes.

1014
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:54,926
Stop.

1015
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:00,473
Big spoon or little spoon? Little spoon.

1016
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:03,518
Thank you.

1017
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:16,031
Dad, there's no way you're
gonna lose your job, right?

1018
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:17,240
What?

1019
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:19,909
Well, I don't know.

1020
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:22,162
I'm just wondering.
Where'd you hear that?

1021
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:24,289
Well, I go on the Internet sometimes.

1022
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:27,625
Well, don't do that.
Don't go on the Internet.

1023
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:30,628
Or watch TV or read newspapers

1024
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:33,339
or talk to people.

1025
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:36,176
I don't talk to people.
I just read stuff.

1026
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:38,970
Honey, everything's
fine. Everything's fine.

1027
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,598
Really, you don't have to worry.

1028
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:45,143
But if you lose your job,
will you have to move away?

1029
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,313
Honey, I'm not gonna lose my job.

1030
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:51,733
You don't have to worry.

1031
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:56,488
Okay. Hey.

1032
01:07:57,073 --> 01:08:00,450
There's no problem. Okay.

1033
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:03,953
All right? I got uptown problems,
which are not problems at all.

1034
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:06,331
You're not worried, right?

1035
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:09,000
No, I'm not worried. Okay.

1036
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,967
Pena.

1037
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:22,263
Okay.

1038
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:37,195
I want Dye in right,

1039
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:40,198
Justice DH'ing, Pena on the bench,

1040
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,158
Hatteberg at first,

1041
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:45,370
and anyone but Mags
first out of the pen.

1042
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:47,455
You want Pena on the bench?

1043
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:50,750
That's right. So you can play Hattie.

1044
01:08:50,918 --> 01:08:53,169
Pena is not only the best first baseman,

1045
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:55,505
he's the only first baseman.

1046
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:58,049
Hattie gets on base more than Pena.

1047
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:00,718
In fact, 20 percent
more. And his fielding?

1048
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:03,555
His fielding does not matter.

1049
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,808
I've heard enough of this. Have you?

1050
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,560
And I, uh...

1051
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:12,397
I disagree with you, plain and simple.

1052
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:15,483
And moreover, I'm playing my team

1053
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:19,654
in a way that I can explain
in job interviews next winter.

1054
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:22,240
Okay? Ahem.

1055
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:30,248
Hattie. Not Pena.

1056
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:35,962
What's up, skip?

1057
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:38,590
How you doing? Good, how you doing, man?

1058
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:40,383
Get some sleep last night?

1059
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:45,597
As the A's hit the field,
we are ready for baseball.

1060
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:49,100
First one out of the dugout is
rookie sensation Carlos Pena,

1061
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:53,563
one of the few bright lights in this
lineup, taking his spot at first base.

1062
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:30,099
Down, gettin' down There's
a whole lot of rhythm

1063
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:37,565
Billy, quick question. Do you
expect these guys to produce more or

1064
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:39,943
Not now. What's the
reason for the slump?

1065
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:41,569
We gotta have the funk

1066
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:44,405
Ow, we want the funk

1067
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:45,949
Give up the funk

1068
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:48,326
Ow, we need the funk

1069
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:50,995
We gotta have the funk

1070
01:10:58,337 --> 01:10:59,879
Get down.

1071
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:06,010
Is losing fun?

1072
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:12,350
Is losing fun? No.

1073
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,690
What are you having fun for?

1074
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:46,509
That's what losing sounds like.

1075
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:02,483
Are you okay, Dad?

1076
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:05,194
You're doing it again. What?

1077
01:12:05,362 --> 01:12:07,655
You're worrying about me.

1078
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:09,699
You're in last place, Dad.

1079
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:12,243
Do I look worried? Yeah.

1080
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:16,372
Because you're getting on an airplane,
and those things crash all the time.

1081
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:18,958
Please stop worrying about your dad.

1082
01:12:21,253 --> 01:12:22,879
We're all set. Okay.

1083
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:26,924
I love you. Love you too.

1084
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:30,261
All right. Your dad's not in trouble.

1085
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:33,264
Okay.

1086
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:13,971
Yeah.

1087
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:22,146
Suzanne, get me Ed Wade. Okay.

1088
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:24,023
Coffee on? Yes.

1089
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:26,818
Good morning. Good morning, Billy.

1090
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:32,240
Oh, hi, Louisa.

1091
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:35,326
I need Ed Wade for Billy Beane. Hi.

1092
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:37,537
Please hold.

1093
01:13:37,704 --> 01:13:40,331
What's up? Wade's on 2.

1094
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:41,958
Ed? Hello?

1095
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:44,544
Ed, it's Billy. Billy, what's up?

1096
01:13:44,711 --> 01:13:47,713
Look, I need a little
help on defense. Okay.

1097
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:50,466
I'm willing to trade
Jeremy Giambi for it.

1098
01:13:51,176 --> 01:13:52,635
Really? What?

1099
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:54,929
Mm-hm. Who you got? What?

1100
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:58,266
Well, let me think. What are you doing?

1101
01:13:58,434 --> 01:13:59,684
Cleaning house.

1102
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,811
Mabry? Maybe what?

1103
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:05,022
No, Mabry. Hold on.

1104
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:07,024
No. Why not?

1105
01:14:07,192 --> 01:14:09,360
Because you can't trade Jeremy Giambi.

1106
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:12,113
He'll be fine, Ed.

1107
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,866
Why do I get the feeling
you're picking my pocket?

1108
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:18,369
I'm not. You're picking mine.
Giambi's name alone is worth more.

1109
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:20,746
What's wrong with him? Nothing.

1110
01:14:20,914 --> 01:14:24,417
Can we say it's done in theory
and start drawing up the paperwork?

1111
01:14:24,585 --> 01:14:26,836
Okay, but you're gonna have
- Great.

1112
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:28,713
He was gonna say something else.

1113
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:31,466
When you get the answer
you're looking for, hang up.

1114
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:32,675
Suzanne. Yes?

1115
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:35,303
David Dombrowski. Okay.

1116
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:38,431
And Pena's going too. I don't
think you should do that.

1117
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:40,558
I really don't think you should do that.

1118
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:43,060
I want Hatteberg in the lineup tonight.

1119
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:44,604
You need to take a minute.

1120
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:47,899
I think you seriously need to
think about what you're doing.

1121
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:50,568
Because you're upset. Okay.

1122
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:52,904
What am I missing?

1123
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:55,907
These are hard moves
to explain to people.

1124
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:58,409
Why is that a problem, Pete?

1125
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:03,414
Don't make an emotional decision, Billy.

1126
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:05,416
David Dombrowski's on 3.

1127
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:07,960
Look, we're gonna shake things up.

1128
01:15:08,128 --> 01:15:11,172
Dave. Pena's going on the
block. You're my first call.

1129
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:14,967
Because he's making the
rest of the team look bad.

1130
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,762
He's gonna be a Rookie of the Year.

1131
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:21,098
Probably an All-Star.
He's an All-Star, Dave.

1132
01:15:21,975 --> 01:15:24,769
No. I want a reliever and cash.

1133
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:28,940
Okay. You got five minutes,
Dave. I'm not waiting.

1134
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:33,444
Billy, Pena is an All-Star, okay?

1135
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:39,534
And if you dump him and this Hatteberg
thing doesn't work out, you know this is-

1136
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:42,787
This is the kind of
decision that gets you fired.

1137
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,539
It is.

1138
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:47,124
Yes, you're right.

1139
01:15:47,584 --> 01:15:49,877
I may lose my job.

1140
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:53,464
In which case I'm a 44-year-old
guy with a high school diploma

1141
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:56,926
and a daughter I'd like to
be able to send to college.

1142
01:15:57,427 --> 01:16:00,471
You're 25 years old,
with a degree from Yale

1143
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:03,224
and a pretty impressive apprenticeship.

1144
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:06,811
I don't think we're
asking the right question.

1145
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:10,314
I think the question
we should be asking is,

1146
01:16:10,482 --> 01:16:13,150
do you believe in this thing or not?

1147
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:16,571
I do.

1148
01:16:19,616 --> 01:16:22,660
It's a problem you think we
need to explain ourselves.

1149
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:26,038
Don't. To anyone.

1150
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:30,876
Okay.

1151
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:36,882
Now, I'm gonna see this thing
through, for better or worse.

1152
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:45,182
Just tell me, do you project we'll win
more with Hatteberg or Pena at first?

1153
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:48,185
It's close...

1154
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:51,439
but theoretically, Hatteberg.

1155
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:54,108
What are we talking about, then?

1156
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:57,320
Dombrowski's on again, on 3.

1157
01:16:59,656 --> 01:17:01,073
Yeah?

1158
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:03,701
Okay, that'll work.

1159
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:06,621
Great. I need one more thing.

1160
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:10,041
Soda. Yeah, I don't want
my guys paying for soda.

1161
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:12,877
I want you to stock my
machine for three years.

1162
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:14,545
I'm serious.

1163
01:17:15,547 --> 01:17:17,548
Great. It's a deal.

1164
01:17:18,675 --> 01:17:20,635
Go tell Pena he's gotta pack.

1165
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:25,348
You want me to tell
Pena? Part of the job.

1166
01:17:27,851 --> 01:17:30,269
What about Giambi? You
want me to tell him too?

1167
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:32,396
I'll tell him.

1168
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:40,946
Excuse me, Carlos? Yeah?

1169
01:17:41,114 --> 01:17:43,074
Can I speak with you a minute? Yeah.

1170
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:54,418
Carlos, you've been
traded to the Tigers.

1171
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:59,924
This is Jay Palmer's number.

1172
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,635
He's the traveling
secretary for the team.

1173
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:05,846
He's expecting your call.
He'll take care of everything.

1174
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:17,608
Is that it? Yes.

1175
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:26,325
Okay.

1176
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:40,131
Okay.

1177
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:43,926
Art, you got a minute?

1178
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:50,224
Yeah. Take a seat.

1179
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:57,982
You can't start Pena at first tonight.
You'll have to start Hatteberg.

1180
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:00,985
I don't wanna go 15 rounds, Billy.

1181
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:03,821
The lineup card is mine, and that's all.

1182
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,990
That lineup card is definitely yours.

1183
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:08,743
I'm just saying you
can't start Pena at first.

1184
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:10,411
Well...

1185
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:13,998
I am starting him at first.

1186
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:18,127
I don't think so. He
plays for Detroit now.

1187
01:19:22,048 --> 01:19:24,216
You traded Pena?

1188
01:19:25,385 --> 01:19:26,927
Yeah.

1189
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:31,515
And Menechino, Hiljus, Tam
are all being sent down.

1190
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:35,978
You are outside your mind. Yeah. Cuckoo.

1191
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:40,566
You wanted to see me?
Yeah, Jeremy, grab a seat.

1192
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:46,655
Jeremy, you've been
traded to the Phillies.

1193
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:49,450
This is Ed Wade's number.
He's a good guy, the GM.

1194
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:51,952
He's expecting your call.

1195
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:54,955
Buddy will help you
with the plane flight.

1196
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:59,001
You're a good ballplayer, Jeremy,

1197
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:01,712
and we wish you the best.

1198
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:20,314
Jeremy's gone too.

1199
01:20:22,275 --> 01:20:24,401
You're killing this team.

1200
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:28,239
Art, I can do this all day long.

1201
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:35,746
Hey.

1202
01:20:36,706 --> 01:20:38,749
You agree with this?

1203
01:20:40,126 --> 01:20:41,836
Hundred percent.

1204
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:44,922
You want this door closed?

1205
01:20:57,477 --> 01:20:59,937
Scotty H. Sir?

1206
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:04,608
Go field some grounders. Yes, sir.

1207
01:21:04,776 --> 01:21:06,610
Everybody, listen up.

1208
01:21:09,614 --> 01:21:12,366
You may not look like a winning team...

1209
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:17,705
but you are one.

1210
01:21:22,085 --> 01:21:23,419
So...

1211
01:21:25,005 --> 01:21:27,047
play like one tonight.

1212
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:37,892
Oh, shit.

1213
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:44,148
When you're getting your pitch,
you're hitting. 625, massive.

1214
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:46,150
You're crushing the ball.

1215
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:49,194
But when you swing at things-
Your pitch is middle-in.

1216
01:21:49,362 --> 01:21:52,239
When you're swinging low and
away, you're batting. 158.

1217
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,491
Every at bat's like a hand of blackjack.

1218
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:56,994
Every card that's
dealt, your odds change.

1219
01:21:57,162 --> 01:22:01,498
So every first-pitch strike, your
batting average goes down about 75 points.

1220
01:22:01,666 --> 01:22:02,833
Seventy-five points.

1221
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:05,252
He should throw 100
pitches before the fifth.

1222
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:07,171
You wanna knock that starter out.

1223
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:10,841
I want you taking at bats off the
1 Oth and 11th pitcher by the end.

1224
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:13,427
This is your basic
breakdown of the pitches,

1225
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:15,804
where you should be hitting them, why.

1226
01:22:15,972 --> 01:22:19,516
So you want us to walk
more? Good question. Yes.

1227
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:23,020
Mr. Justice.

1228
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:25,147
Had a few thoughts. Yeah?

1229
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:27,691
Yeah. Gonna teach me some things?

1230
01:22:28,151 --> 01:22:29,860
Excuse me?

1231
01:22:31,404 --> 01:22:33,697
Never seen a GM talk
to players like that.

1232
01:22:33,865 --> 01:22:36,533
You never seen a GM who was a player.

1233
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:39,662
Huh.

1234
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:45,626
We got a problem, David? No, it's okay.

1235
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:48,003
I know your routine.

1236
01:22:48,171 --> 01:22:50,464
It's patter. It's for effect.

1237
01:22:52,717 --> 01:22:56,887
But it's for them, all
right? That shit ain't for me.

1238
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:59,139
Oh, you're special?

1239
01:23:01,559 --> 01:23:06,188
You're paying me 7 million
bucks a year, man, so, yeah,

1240
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:08,691
maybe I am, a little bit.

1241
01:23:08,858 --> 01:23:11,819
No, man, I ain't paying you 7.

1242
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:14,405
Yankees are paying half your salary.

1243
01:23:14,572 --> 01:23:17,408
That's what the New York
Yankees think of you.

1244
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:22,579
They're paying you $3.5
million to play against them.

1245
01:23:23,873 --> 01:23:26,041
Where you going with this, Billy?

1246
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:29,169
David, you're 37.

1247
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:33,090
How about you and I be honest about
what each of us want out of this?

1248
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:38,095
I wanna milk the last ounce
of baseball you got in you.

1249
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:40,556
And you wanna stay in the show.

1250
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:43,058
Let's do that.

1251
01:23:43,935 --> 01:23:46,520
I'm not paying you for
the player you used to be.

1252
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:49,690
I'm paying you for the
player you are right now.

1253
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:53,277
You're smart. You get what
we're trying to do here.

1254
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:56,280
Make an example for the younger guys.

1255
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:58,240
Be a leader.

1256
01:23:58,908 --> 01:24:00,576
Can you do that?

1257
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:10,627
All right. I got you.

1258
01:24:13,089 --> 01:24:14,798
We're cool?

1259
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:18,343
We're cool.

1260
01:24:23,641 --> 01:24:24,850
Scotty H.

1261
01:24:25,018 --> 01:24:27,144
Yo, what's up, D.J.? Picking machine.

1262
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:30,731
How you liking first base, man?

1263
01:24:32,025 --> 01:24:35,235
It's coming along. Picking it up.

1264
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:39,531
You know, tough transition, but
I'm starting to feel better with it.

1265
01:24:39,699 --> 01:24:41,742
Yeah? Yeah.

1266
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:43,827
What's your biggest fear?

1267
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:47,164
A baseball being hit
in my general direction.

1268
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:52,377
That's funny. Seriously, what is it?

1269
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,175
No, seriously, that is.

1270
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:11,271
Well, hey, good luck with that.

1271
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:13,607
Be social out there.

1272
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:17,069
Social. Social. Like
a greeter at the Gap.

1273
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:19,321
Guy steps into your office, chat him up.

1274
01:25:19,489 --> 01:25:22,157
You're well-read. You went to school.

1275
01:25:22,325 --> 01:25:24,493
Yeah. Have some fun. Relax.

1276
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:27,538
Everyone wants to attack.
Quit trying to attack.

1277
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:30,958
Let the game come to you, man.
There's no clock on this thing.

1278
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:32,543
This is a war of attrition.

1279
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:37,131
If I take more, I could even take a
few strikes, but I'll get walked more.

1280
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:41,051
You get on base, we
win. You don't, we lose.

1281
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:44,555
And I hate losing, Chavvie. I hate it.

1282
01:25:44,722 --> 01:25:47,307
I hate losing more
than I even wanna win.

1283
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:48,809
And there's a difference.

1284
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:50,477
No bunts. Bunts is an out.

1285
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:53,897
Even if the third baseman is
back? No bunting whatsoever.

1286
01:25:54,065 --> 01:25:56,817
If someone bunts on
us, throw it to first.

1287
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:58,735
Don't be a hero and go to second.

1288
01:25:58,903 --> 01:26:00,320
Let them make the mistakes.

1289
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:03,407
When your enemy's making
mistakes, don't interrupt them.

1290
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:06,118
They're giving you an
out. Just giving it to you.

1291
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:07,578
Take it. Say thank you.

1292
01:26:07,745 --> 01:26:09,746
Another thing. No more stealing.

1293
01:26:09,914 --> 01:26:11,957
That's what I do, what you pay me to do.

1294
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:15,085
I pay you to get on first,
not get thrown out at second.

1295
01:26:15,253 --> 01:26:20,215
This is a process. It's a
process, it's a process. Okay?

1296
01:26:32,562 --> 01:26:36,440
Jason takes it, goes to second for
the only out, and the A's get a run.

1297
01:26:38,067 --> 01:26:42,154
Jermaine Dye homers again,
his second in two games.

1298
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:46,783
And the A's are still hanging
in. We'll get you scores here.

1299
01:26:46,951 --> 01:26:51,413
The A's pull within two of the
Angels for the wild-card chase.

1300
01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:53,749
The Reds have now dropped five in a row

1301
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:57,294
as Oakland beats them in the
beginning of this series 5 to 3.

1302
01:26:57,462 --> 01:26:58,795
Tejada walks.

1303
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:00,297
Ball four.

1304
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:03,342
Ball four and Hatteberg walks.

1305
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:08,388
What is happening in Oakland?
The A's have won seven in a row.

1306
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:10,807
A lot of excitement.
What a winning streak.

1307
01:27:10,975 --> 01:27:13,810
But how about the calming
influence of Art Howe?

1308
01:27:13,978 --> 01:27:17,606
When you say "your source," if it's
not me or Peter, they don't know.

1309
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:19,483
He's managing an unorthodox team.

1310
01:27:19,651 --> 01:27:21,443
Right. It's not a perfect roster.

1311
01:27:21,611 --> 01:27:24,905
But right now, Art Howe is the
reason this team is winning.

1312
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:27,658
He deserves the credit.
Great, thanks. Bye.

1313
01:27:27,825 --> 01:27:29,368
Did you hear that?

1314
01:27:29,535 --> 01:27:32,496
I heard "seven in a row. "
You get the Cleveland matchups?

1315
01:27:32,664 --> 01:27:34,581
Yeah, right here.

1316
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:43,799
Voos. Billy.

1317
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:47,219
That smell is getting worse. I'm on it.

1318
01:27:47,971 --> 01:27:50,138
What are we doing? Splitting it in half?

1319
01:27:50,306 --> 01:27:52,140
Both sides of the plate. Got it.

1320
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:55,018
Huddy. Mix it up. Yes, sir.

1321
01:27:55,186 --> 01:27:57,354
Trust your slider, yeah? Yes, sir.

1322
01:27:57,522 --> 01:27:59,523
You guys quit distracting him.

1323
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:02,401
You couldn't hit that shit
last night with a paddle.

1324
01:28:02,568 --> 01:28:04,403
You gotta see more pitches.

1325
01:28:04,570 --> 01:28:07,072
All right, Billy. Patience.

1326
01:28:10,868 --> 01:28:12,494
Hey, David. Hey, Billy.

1327
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:14,037
Great at bats. Thank you.

1328
01:28:14,205 --> 01:28:15,747
Really quality. Thank you.

1329
01:28:15,915 --> 01:28:18,625
Base hit to right field. Tejada scores.

1330
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:21,670
Chavez coming in. The
ball gets past Guiel.

1331
01:28:22,588 --> 01:28:26,717
The A's, from 5-nothing
down, now lead 6 to 5.

1332
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:39,730
The Oakland A's are completely
out of hand at the moment.

1333
01:28:39,897 --> 01:28:42,566
They are an AL-best
17 and 4 this month.

1334
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:46,528
They also took back-to-back
series at Boston and at New York.

1335
01:28:46,696 --> 01:28:49,323
Remember when they traded
Jeremy Giambi in June

1336
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:51,825
and everyone thought
they'd just given up?

1337
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:54,661
Actually, not so much.

1338
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:01,251
Suzanne, get Shapiro on the phone.

1339
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:04,921
You thinking Rincon? His
season's done. He's lost faith.

1340
01:29:05,089 --> 01:29:08,091
I think he's gonna dump him. Hard-core.

1341
01:29:08,259 --> 01:29:10,552
Shapiro on 2.

1342
01:29:12,096 --> 01:29:13,889
Mark, Billy. Let's be honest.

1343
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:17,434
A premier setup man isn't gonna
get you closer to the play-offs.

1344
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:19,519
Are you referring to Rincon?

1345
01:29:19,687 --> 01:29:21,688
He's a luxury you can't afford, man.

1346
01:29:21,856 --> 01:29:24,566
And you can? There's half
a million on his contract.

1347
01:29:24,734 --> 01:29:26,777
And we've got at least one other suitor.

1348
01:29:26,944 --> 01:29:29,654
By "at least one," you mean one.

1349
01:29:29,822 --> 01:29:32,282
Who is it? I'd rather not say.

1350
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:34,785
San Francisco. San Francisco.

1351
01:29:34,952 --> 01:29:36,453
I'll call you back.

1352
01:29:38,247 --> 01:29:40,415
What do you think we
can get for Magnante?

1353
01:29:40,583 --> 01:29:41,833
Nothing.

1354
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:45,796
What's left on Venafro's
contract? Two seventy-five.

1355
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:48,423
Suzanne, get me Sabean on the line.

1356
01:29:48,591 --> 01:29:52,677
Get the Giants interested in Venafro,
Mark's only got one buyer for Rincon.

1357
01:29:52,845 --> 01:29:54,304
Us. On 3.

1358
01:29:56,349 --> 01:29:59,810
Saby-Sabster, it's Billy.
What do you think of Venafro?

1359
01:29:59,977 --> 01:30:02,145
I can let you have
him for almost nothing.

1360
01:30:02,313 --> 01:30:04,898
Why would you do that?
Because I'm amazing.

1361
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:07,067
I want a couple bucks and a sweetener.

1362
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:09,319
Throw in, say...

1363
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:11,655
Anderson. Anderson.

1364
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:14,783
I like Anderson. No, you
don't. Nobody likes him.

1365
01:30:14,951 --> 01:30:17,494
I don't know why I'm doing
this. But let's do it.

1366
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:20,580
Venafro for Michaelson.
Anderson. I don't know his name.

1367
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:23,625
I'll think about it. Think
about it and call me back.

1368
01:30:24,168 --> 01:30:26,169
Get Shapiro on.

1369
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:36,346
Shapiro's on 2.

1370
01:30:38,391 --> 01:30:40,350
Mark. You can't afford him, Billy.

1371
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:41,601
You sure about that?

1372
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:44,354
I get the impression the
market for Rincon is softening.

1373
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:46,148
Huh? I could be wrong,

1374
01:30:46,315 --> 01:30:47,941
but I'd call whoever's interested

1375
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:51,611
and see if they're still
interested. Call me back.

1376
01:30:52,488 --> 01:30:55,866
What about the Mets for Venafro?
You offered him to the Giants.

1377
01:30:56,033 --> 01:30:57,701
Suzanne, Steve Phillips.

1378
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:02,706
Between Bonds, Kent, Nen, Snow,
San Francisco's never gonna do it.

1379
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:06,877
Totally agree. We just
need them to cool on Rincon.

1380
01:31:07,044 --> 01:31:10,172
Phillips on 2. Steve-o, it's Billy.

1381
01:31:10,339 --> 01:31:14,050
I hear you're looking for a
reliever. I can give you Venafro.

1382
01:31:14,218 --> 01:31:16,845
I can make it quick and
easy. What's the angle?

1383
01:31:17,013 --> 01:31:19,890
No angle. Who am I getting fleeced for?

1384
01:31:20,558 --> 01:31:23,935
Hang on a sec. Uh, Bennett, maybe?

1385
01:31:24,103 --> 01:31:25,479
How old? Twenty-six.

1386
01:31:25,646 --> 01:31:27,731
Twenty-six,
Double-A? Forget it.

1387
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:29,983
Duncan, no.

1388
01:31:31,777 --> 01:31:33,528
No. Furbush, no.

1389
01:31:36,199 --> 01:31:39,910
Eckerton? Eckerton? Eckerton.

1390
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:41,912
Eckerton.

1391
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:44,498
I like Eckerton. You don't
even know who Eckerton is.

1392
01:31:45,875 --> 01:31:48,418
Is Venafro hurt? No,
he's fine, he's fine.

1393
01:31:48,586 --> 01:31:49,920
It's just an issue for us.

1394
01:31:50,087 --> 01:31:52,756
Last couple times, he got
hammered. Not his fault.

1395
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:55,091
That was us. We misused him. It's Steve.

1396
01:31:55,259 --> 01:31:57,260
I'm almost done. Steve Schott.

1397
01:31:57,678 --> 01:32:00,639
Look, Steve-o, let me
be straight with you.

1398
01:32:00,806 --> 01:32:03,600
Here's the deal. I'm getting
Rincon. It's a done deal.

1399
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:06,853
I heard the Giants
- Giants want Venafro for Michaelson.

1400
01:32:07,021 --> 01:32:08,939
Anderson. I'd rather deal with you.

1401
01:32:09,106 --> 01:32:12,108
You can give me Eckerton
and $225,000 in cash,

1402
01:32:12,276 --> 01:32:14,319
and the Giants can't.

1403
01:32:15,154 --> 01:32:17,197
I'll think about it. Think about it.

1404
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:19,741
But whoever calls me
back first gets Venafro.

1405
01:32:22,161 --> 01:32:23,370
Schott hung up.

1406
01:32:24,830 --> 01:32:28,124
Oh, I want this one.

1407
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:38,468
Why isn't anybody calling?

1408
01:32:41,264 --> 01:32:43,473
Shapiro's on 2.

1409
01:32:44,850 --> 01:32:46,268
Yeah?

1410
01:32:50,439 --> 01:32:53,066
Okay, let me talk to my
owner. I'll call you back.

1411
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:55,944
Get Steve on the phone.
Schott or Phillips?

1412
01:32:56,112 --> 01:32:58,989
Why would we call Phillips?
Phillips has gotta call us.

1413
01:33:02,827 --> 01:33:04,578
Tell him I'm on the other line.

1414
01:33:08,332 --> 01:33:12,002
Hi, Mr. Schott, it's Peter Brand.
I apologize for putting you on hold.

1415
01:33:12,169 --> 01:33:16,965
Billy asked me to call you back.
Tell him we want 225,000 for Rincon.

1416
01:33:17,133 --> 01:33:22,178
Billy says he needs
$225,000 for Ricardo Rincon.

1417
01:33:22,722 --> 01:33:24,347
Please.

1418
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:29,144
Yes, I added the "please" at the end.

1419
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:33,773
Okay. Let me
- Hold on one second, please.

1420
01:33:34,567 --> 01:33:36,568
Tell him I'll pay for him.

1421
01:33:36,736 --> 01:33:41,072
But when I sell him back for twice
the amount next year, I keep the money.

1422
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:46,036
Okay, so Billy says he'll
pay for Rincon himself.

1423
01:33:46,203 --> 01:33:50,498
But when he sells him for more money
next year, he's keeping the profit.

1424
01:34:00,426 --> 01:34:03,136
Thank you very much. We'll
call you back. Thank you.

1425
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:05,764
Come on. Come on.

1426
01:34:11,062 --> 01:34:14,898
Suzanne, call Shapiro ba
- Never mind, I got him right here.

1427
01:34:17,693 --> 01:34:19,486
Mark. Yeah.

1428
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:22,572
Listen, I don't want Rincon
pitching against me tonight.

1429
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:26,242
Tell him to change clothes and
send him over. I got you the money.

1430
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:27,827
Yup.

1431
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:29,412
Great.

1432
01:34:33,584 --> 01:34:37,587
I don't wanna dampen the mood at
all, but since we picked up Rincon...

1433
01:34:37,755 --> 01:34:40,006
We gotta send someone down.

1434
01:34:46,722 --> 01:34:49,766
Mags. Hey, Billy.

1435
01:34:52,728 --> 01:34:54,604
I know I've been struggling lately.

1436
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:58,525
But second half of the season,
definitely turn it around. Ricky and I-

1437
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:02,612
Mike, I need you to
stop getting dressed.

1438
01:35:05,157 --> 01:35:06,783
Traded?

1439
01:35:17,628 --> 01:35:20,046
I'm sorry for the crap news.

1440
01:35:20,798 --> 01:35:22,757
I know it hurts.

1441
01:35:32,977 --> 01:35:35,812
Mike, I can't have 26
guys in the clubhouse.

1442
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:38,940
I get it. I get it.

1443
01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:43,361
Okay. Thanks.

1444
01:35:57,626 --> 01:35:58,918
Hey, Ricardo.

1445
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:03,757
This must be a bit of a shock, I guess.

1446
01:36:04,341 --> 01:36:06,676
Mabry hits one deep
to right-center field.

1447
01:36:06,844 --> 01:36:08,845
Racing back, Fick can't get it.

1448
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:12,640
It bounces to the wall. One
run is in. Two runs are in.

1449
01:36:13,058 --> 01:36:16,352
Mabry, on one pitch, has
shot the A's in front.

1450
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:20,857
Strike three called. Twelve
straight wins for the Athletics.

1451
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:22,442
Man alive, was it hairy.

1452
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:25,028
Something strange is
now happening in Oakland.

1453
01:36:25,196 --> 01:36:27,614
You cannot argue that
point. Twelve straight.

1454
01:36:27,782 --> 01:36:30,700
They're making a joke out
of the American League.

1455
01:36:30,868 --> 01:36:33,453
They were in Detroit today
- He throws to first.

1456
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:37,165
And that's the sound of
14 straight victories.

1457
01:36:37,333 --> 01:36:39,375
Fourteen, the longest run this year.

1458
01:36:39,543 --> 01:36:42,629
It has slingshot the A's into
first in the AL West. A nice streak.

1459
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:44,631
This team was written off.

1460
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:48,259
How do you explain, otherwise,
the victories they've come up with?

1461
01:36:48,427 --> 01:36:51,971
The Oakland A's are gonna
win 16 consecutive games.

1462
01:36:53,015 --> 01:36:59,062
This is the longest win streak
in baseball, folks, in 25 years.

1463
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:01,064
The A's have won 16 in a row.

1464
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:03,817
We're going to 20! We're going to 20!

1465
01:37:03,984 --> 01:37:08,238
To have a winning streak of this
duration, you have to be good,

1466
01:37:08,405 --> 01:37:11,324
but there's an element
of randomness to it.

1467
01:37:11,492 --> 01:37:13,701
The 1927 Yankees, Ruth, Gehrig,

1468
01:37:13,869 --> 01:37:16,996
Murderers' Row, some people
still say the best team ever.

1469
01:37:17,164 --> 01:37:20,708
Longest winning streak
for them that year? Nine.

1470
01:37:20,876 --> 01:37:23,878
You guys try to analyze it
from a numbers standpoint.

1471
01:37:24,046 --> 01:37:28,091
I'm telling you, there is no explanation
for what's occurring right now.

1472
01:37:28,259 --> 01:37:30,134
Do you have superstitions going on?

1473
01:37:30,302 --> 01:37:32,637
Do you do things so you
keep the streak alive?

1474
01:37:32,805 --> 01:37:36,349
The all-time record of 20 does
not seem impossible anymore.

1475
01:37:36,517 --> 01:37:38,852
The A's were on page
one ofthe New York Times.

1476
01:37:39,019 --> 01:37:42,397
They are the story in sports
in this entire country.

1477
01:37:42,565 --> 01:37:43,940
Two-two pitch, here it is.

1478
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:48,194
Swing and a miss! Struck
him out! Number 17!

1479
01:37:48,362 --> 01:37:51,281
It's taken 71 years.

1480
01:37:51,448 --> 01:37:54,367
The Oakland A's have
tied the Philadelphia A's.

1481
01:37:54,535 --> 01:37:58,454
The all-time franchise
record 17 straight

1482
01:37:58,622 --> 01:38:03,877
and baseball's longest
winning streak since 1953.

1483
01:38:04,044 --> 01:38:07,964
The A's are two wins away from
tying the American League record.

1484
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:13,803
It's gone! It's gone! Tejada
wins it! Do you believe it?

1485
01:38:14,305 --> 01:38:16,472
Eighteen wins in a row!

1486
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:19,559
You could replay these 18
games a hundred times over.

1487
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:21,644
And nobody wins 18 straight again.

1488
01:38:21,812 --> 01:38:24,355
It defies everything
we know about baseball.

1489
01:38:24,815 --> 01:38:28,151
The most amazing thing you could imagine

1490
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:31,279
happened over the last
four days at the Coliseum.

1491
01:38:31,447 --> 01:38:36,993
Tejada, up the middle. The
A's have won 19 in a row!

1492
01:38:37,912 --> 01:38:40,496
The 1906 White Sox,

1493
01:38:40,664 --> 01:38:44,667
the 1947 New York Yankees have company.

1494
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,420
Nineteen in a row.

1495
01:38:47,588 --> 01:38:50,506
The A's have a date with destiny.

1496
01:38:50,674 --> 01:38:53,718
They're going for the all-time
American League record,

1497
01:38:53,886 --> 01:38:55,011
20 games in a row.

1498
01:38:55,179 --> 01:38:59,474
We're going to 20! We're gonna
take the AL record to 20, baby!

1499
01:39:02,353 --> 01:39:04,187
Don't tell me the score, Pete.

1500
01:39:04,355 --> 01:39:05,730
No, Billy, it's me.

1501
01:39:05,898 --> 01:39:08,149
Sharon? Yeah.

1502
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:12,528
You have a second? Yeah, what's up?

1503
01:39:12,696 --> 01:39:15,073
Well, I didn't actually
expect you to pick up.

1504
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:17,033
I was gonna leave a message.

1505
01:39:17,201 --> 01:39:21,037
Um, Casey and I, we're here
and watching the game at home.

1506
01:39:21,205 --> 01:39:24,874
And I just wanted to say...

1507
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:27,961
you did good, Billy.

1508
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:30,171
We're really proud of you.

1509
01:39:31,674 --> 01:39:34,008
I appreciate it, Sharon.

1510
01:39:34,176 --> 01:39:37,053
Thank you. Good luck.

1511
01:39:37,846 --> 01:39:38,888
Okay.

1512
01:39:39,056 --> 01:39:41,391
Oh, Casey wants to talk to you. Hang on.

1513
01:39:42,184 --> 01:39:43,977
Are you on your way to the stadium?

1514
01:39:44,144 --> 01:39:47,188
No, I'm on my way to Visalia
to see our minor-league team.

1515
01:39:47,356 --> 01:39:50,108
Turn around, please, Dad. No way, Jose.

1516
01:39:50,275 --> 01:39:52,986
Turn around. Come on, Dad.
Nope. Not gonna happen.

1517
01:39:53,153 --> 01:39:54,487
You're not gonna jinx it.

1518
01:39:54,655 --> 01:39:58,241
I'll talk to you later,
sweetheart. I love you.

1519
01:40:04,748 --> 01:40:06,124
Shit.

1520
01:40:06,291 --> 01:40:09,419
One out here in the fourth,
and if you're just joining us,

1521
01:40:09,586 --> 01:40:10,670
you missed a lot.

1522
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:13,881
And the pitch to Raul
Ibanez. Strike one.

1523
01:40:14,049 --> 01:40:15,758
I think my recap will be simple.

1524
01:40:15,926 --> 01:40:19,595
The A's scored six in the first,
one in the second, four in the third.

1525
01:40:19,763 --> 01:40:23,349
And people would be shocked if
you just did that. Heh-heh-heh.

1526
01:40:23,517 --> 01:40:25,768
Eleven to nothing, the A's do lead.

1527
01:40:25,936 --> 01:40:28,646
Shit. Foul off the foot of Ibanez...

1528
01:40:51,128 --> 01:40:53,755
Let's go, Oakland!

1529
01:40:53,922 --> 01:40:59,260
Let's go, Oakland!

1530
01:41:04,683 --> 01:41:10,813
Now batting, number 2,
catcher, Brent Mayne.

1531
01:41:14,943 --> 01:41:18,905
Oakland! Here we go, Oakland!

1532
01:41:27,498 --> 01:41:29,082
Two.

1533
01:41:30,709 --> 01:41:32,376
Safe.

1534
01:41:37,758 --> 01:41:39,217
Now batting,

1535
01:41:39,384 --> 01:41:45,014
number 18, left fielder Raul Ibanez.

1536
01:42:46,201 --> 01:42:47,785
Safe.

1537
01:42:50,205 --> 01:42:52,582
And the A's now lead
by a score of 11 to 3.

1538
01:42:52,749 --> 01:42:55,585
A nice cushion, but you
don't wanna give teams life

1539
01:42:55,752 --> 01:42:58,421
and let them wedge their way
back in, even when you're-

1540
01:43:42,424 --> 01:43:44,133
Nobody out, the bases loaded.

1541
01:43:44,301 --> 01:43:47,637
And Art Howe on the way to the
mound to make a pitching change.

1542
01:43:47,804 --> 01:43:49,722
And this game is still in a state

1543
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:52,808
where it could get out of
control for the Athletics.

1544
01:43:59,483 --> 01:44:02,735
We're all told at some point we can
no longer play the children's game.

1545
01:44:02,903 --> 01:44:06,489
We just don't know when that's gonna be.

1546
01:44:10,077 --> 01:44:15,539
Some of us are told at 18, some of
us are told at 40, but we're all told.

1547
01:44:15,707 --> 01:44:18,042
Mike Sweeney with runners
at first and third.

1548
01:44:18,210 --> 01:44:20,628
It's an 11-to-7 game,
the A's in front.

1549
01:44:20,796 --> 01:44:23,506
Tam peering in for the sign.

1550
01:44:23,674 --> 01:44:26,676
Two out. Runners at first and third.

1551
01:44:26,843 --> 01:44:29,303
And the 3-2 delivery.

1552
01:45:03,046 --> 01:45:05,381
It's weird, Billy.

1553
01:45:05,549 --> 01:45:09,593
You wanna give up
baseball to become a scout?

1554
01:45:10,929 --> 01:45:13,347
I'm not a baseball player.

1555
01:45:13,765 --> 01:45:16,225
Are you sure this is what you want?

1556
01:45:17,561 --> 01:45:22,148
The crowd is roaring. Koch
is ready. One-two pitch.

1557
01:45:22,607 --> 01:45:25,901
Alicea puts it in play, a looper
to left field for a base hit.

1558
01:45:26,069 --> 01:45:29,488
Around third, tearing for the
plate, here comes the tying run.

1559
01:45:29,698 --> 01:45:33,701
Sliding safe. And the ball
game is tied at 11-all.

1560
01:45:33,869 --> 01:45:35,494
Holy Toledo.

1561
01:45:36,788 --> 01:45:41,083
The A's have blown
an 11-to-nothing lead.

1562
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:46,922
This is the specter of a
development that has been lurking now

1563
01:45:47,382 --> 01:45:51,510
ever since the five-run
fourth inning by the Royals.

1564
01:45:51,678 --> 01:45:57,099
And the A's date with
destiny is on hold right now.

1565
01:46:22,709 --> 01:46:25,961
Hatteberg. Hattie.

1566
01:46:26,463 --> 01:46:28,964
Grab a bat. You're hitting for Byrnesy.

1567
01:46:30,467 --> 01:46:33,803
Come on, let's go. Get yourself loose.

1568
01:46:44,147 --> 01:46:48,025
Hitting for Eric Byrnes,

1569
01:46:48,193 --> 01:46:52,363
number 10, Scott Hatteberg.

1570
01:47:00,497 --> 01:47:04,125
In your typical A's fashion.
They want a base runner here.

1571
01:47:04,292 --> 01:47:08,003
Scott Hatteberg is so
adept at drawing walks.

1572
01:47:11,216 --> 01:47:13,509
He's looking for
Hatteberg to get on base,

1573
01:47:13,677 --> 01:47:15,678
maybe bring in a pinch runner.

1574
01:47:15,846 --> 01:47:18,264
Let's go, Oakland!

1575
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:20,516
Let's go, Oakland!

1576
01:48:15,322 --> 01:48:17,114
That one is gone!

1577
01:48:17,282 --> 01:48:21,744
And it's 20 consecutive victories
for the Oakland Athletics

1578
01:48:21,912 --> 01:48:23,954
on an unbelievable night

1579
01:48:24,122 --> 01:48:26,790
when they lost an
11-to-nothing lead

1580
01:48:26,958 --> 01:48:28,459
and now they win it.

1581
01:48:30,670 --> 01:48:35,174
The crowd comes back to insane life.

1582
01:48:37,093 --> 01:48:39,094
How do you explain it?

1583
01:48:40,055 --> 01:48:44,391
Crazy. Just plain crazy.

1584
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:52,066
Hatteberg is mobbed at home plate.

1585
01:48:55,278 --> 01:48:58,280
In 103 years of
American League baseball,

1586
01:48:58,448 --> 01:49:01,909
the Athletics have accomplished
what no one has before.

1587
01:49:02,077 --> 01:49:06,288
They have won 20 consecutive games.

1588
01:49:32,315 --> 01:49:35,109
It's hard not to be
romantic about baseball.

1589
01:49:36,987 --> 01:49:40,239
This kind of thing,
it's fun for the fans.

1590
01:49:41,157 --> 01:49:44,577
It sells tickets and hot dogs.

1591
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:47,496
Doesn't mean anything.

1592
01:49:47,664 --> 01:49:51,292
Billy, we just won 20 games in a row.

1593
01:49:53,003 --> 01:49:55,045
And what's the point?

1594
01:49:55,213 --> 01:49:57,881
We just got the record.

1595
01:50:00,802 --> 01:50:03,178
Man, I've been doing this for...

1596
01:50:09,185 --> 01:50:11,270
Listen, man.

1597
01:50:11,438 --> 01:50:14,898
I've been in this game a long time.

1598
01:50:16,526 --> 01:50:19,278
I'm not in it for a
record, I'll tell you that.

1599
01:50:19,446 --> 01:50:21,572
I'm not in it for a ring.

1600
01:50:24,242 --> 01:50:26,493
That's when people get hurt.

1601
01:50:28,121 --> 01:50:31,040
If we don't win the
last game of the Series,

1602
01:50:32,292 --> 01:50:34,335
they'll dismiss us.

1603
01:50:34,878 --> 01:50:36,337
Billy
- I know these guys.

1604
01:50:36,504 --> 01:50:39,381
I know the way they think,
and they will erase us.

1605
01:50:40,884 --> 01:50:43,385
And everything we've done here,

1606
01:50:43,553 --> 01:50:45,471
none of it'll matter.

1607
01:50:48,558 --> 01:50:51,894
Any other team wins the
World Series, good for them.

1608
01:50:53,063 --> 01:50:56,398
They're drinking
champagne, they get a ring.

1609
01:50:56,566 --> 01:50:58,525
But if we win,

1610
01:50:59,110 --> 01:51:01,779
on our budget, with this team...

1611
01:51:05,575 --> 01:51:07,618
we'll have changed the game.

1612
01:51:08,411 --> 01:51:10,579
And that's what I want.

1613
01:51:10,747 --> 01:51:12,998
I want it to mean something.

1614
01:51:22,634 --> 01:51:26,762
The A's going to the play-offs
with the West Division title.

1615
01:51:26,930 --> 01:51:29,682
Forgive the A's if
they're not celebrating.

1616
01:51:29,849 --> 01:51:31,392
They have been here before,

1617
01:51:31,559 --> 01:51:35,270
when Oakland went up two games
to none on the Yanks in the ALDS,

1618
01:51:35,438 --> 01:51:37,940
and went nowhere after
losing three straight.

1619
01:51:38,108 --> 01:51:41,443
With a win today over the Twins,
Oakland moves into the ALCS

1620
01:51:41,611 --> 01:51:44,279
for the first time since 1992.

1621
01:51:44,447 --> 01:51:46,156
But remember one thing.

1622
01:51:46,324 --> 01:51:50,160
Percentages hold up over a season,
but for one game, one at bat,

1623
01:51:50,328 --> 01:51:52,871
throw the percentages out the window.

1624
01:52:25,655 --> 01:52:30,200
What the Minnesota Twins exposed
is the fact that the Oakland A's

1625
01:52:30,368 --> 01:52:34,163
were fundamentally not
a sound baseball team.

1626
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:37,833
They had a flawed concept that
started with the general manager

1627
01:52:38,001 --> 01:52:41,503
and the brain trust thinking
they could reinvent baseball.

1628
01:52:41,671 --> 01:52:43,255
You can't approach baseball

1629
01:52:43,423 --> 01:52:46,091
from a statistical,
bean-counting point of view.

1630
01:52:46,259 --> 01:52:48,510
It's won on the field
with fundamental play.

1631
01:52:48,678 --> 01:52:51,764
You have to steal, you have
to bunt, you have to sacrifice.

1632
01:52:51,931 --> 01:52:55,517
You gotta get men in scoring
position, and you gotta bring them in.

1633
01:52:55,685 --> 01:53:00,147
And you don't do that with a
bunch of statistical gimmicks.

1634
01:53:00,315 --> 01:53:03,150
Nobody reinvents this game.

1635
01:53:46,361 --> 01:53:47,778
Yeah.

1636
01:54:56,306 --> 01:55:01,810
Due respect to the Coliseum,
but this is a ballpark.

1637
01:55:01,978 --> 01:55:03,979
Yes, it is.

1638
01:55:06,065 --> 01:55:08,317
We're gonna have some
lunch in a little bit.

1639
01:55:08,484 --> 01:55:10,736
Why don't I have some coffee sent up?

1640
01:55:11,404 --> 01:55:13,155
Denise?

1641
01:55:17,785 --> 01:55:19,661
Thank you, Denise.

1642
01:55:19,829 --> 01:55:21,872
Thanks. You're welcome.

1643
01:55:24,834 --> 01:55:28,503
You know, it's her birthday
and I need to get her a present,

1644
01:55:28,671 --> 01:55:31,632
but she's usually the
one that does that for me.

1645
01:55:32,342 --> 01:55:34,676
So do you have any ideas?

1646
01:55:35,219 --> 01:55:36,595
Scarf.

1647
01:55:36,763 --> 01:55:38,221
You mean like wool?

1648
01:55:38,389 --> 01:55:43,352
No, I meant what women wear
with... You know, decorative.

1649
01:55:43,519 --> 01:55:46,521
Ah. And where would I
get something like that?

1650
01:55:47,482 --> 01:55:50,817
No disrespect, I just lost in
five for the second year in a row.

1651
01:55:50,985 --> 01:55:53,320
Get her a bowling ball for all I care.

1652
01:55:53,488 --> 01:55:54,863
Right.

1653
01:55:55,782 --> 01:55:59,326
Well, Steve told me he's
offering you a new contract.

1654
01:56:00,787 --> 01:56:02,496
Yes.

1655
01:56:02,664 --> 01:56:05,332
So why did you return my call?

1656
01:56:07,418 --> 01:56:10,003
Because it's the Red Sox.

1657
01:56:10,171 --> 01:56:14,716
Because I believe science might offer
an answer to the Curse of the Bambino.

1658
01:56:15,385 --> 01:56:20,681
Because I hear you
hired Bill James. Yup.

1659
01:56:20,848 --> 01:56:25,560
You know, why someone took so
long to hire that guy is beyond me.

1660
01:56:26,521 --> 01:56:28,855
Well, baseball hates him.

1661
01:56:29,399 --> 01:56:34,111
Well, baseball can hate him, you know.

1662
01:56:34,278 --> 01:56:38,240
One of the great things about money
is that it buys a lot of things,

1663
01:56:38,408 --> 01:56:41,952
one of which is the luxury to
disregard what baseball likes,

1664
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:45,080
doesn't like, what baseball
thinks, doesn't think.

1665
01:56:46,708 --> 01:56:49,334
Ah. Sounds nice.

1666
01:56:50,044 --> 01:56:51,420
Well...

1667
01:56:52,088 --> 01:56:54,131
I was grateful for the call.

1668
01:56:54,298 --> 01:56:56,174
You were grateful? Yeah.

1669
01:56:59,429 --> 01:57:03,306
For 41 million, you
built a play-off team.

1670
01:57:03,474 --> 01:57:07,769
You lost Damon, Giambi,
Isringhausen, Pena,

1671
01:57:08,229 --> 01:57:11,606
and you won more games without
them than you did with them.

1672
01:57:11,774 --> 01:57:15,193
You won the exact same number
of games that the Yankees won,

1673
01:57:15,361 --> 01:57:19,281
but the Yankees spent
1.4 million per win,

1674
01:57:19,449 --> 01:57:22,909
and you paid 260,000.

1675
01:57:23,077 --> 01:57:27,122
I know you're taking it in the teeth,
but the first guy through the wall,

1676
01:57:27,582 --> 01:57:29,750
he always gets bloody.

1677
01:57:29,917 --> 01:57:33,295
Always. This is threatening not
just a way of doing business,

1678
01:57:33,463 --> 01:57:36,006
but in their minds, it's
threatening the game.

1679
01:57:36,174 --> 01:57:39,468
Really, what it's threatening
is their livelihood, their jobs.

1680
01:57:39,635 --> 01:57:42,637
It's threatening the
way that they do things.

1681
01:57:42,805 --> 01:57:44,181
Every time that happens,

1682
01:57:44,348 --> 01:57:47,851
whether it's a government, a
way of doing business, whatever,

1683
01:57:48,019 --> 01:57:50,562
the people who are holding the reins,

1684
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:53,315
they have their hands on the switch,

1685
01:57:53,483 --> 01:57:55,984
they go batshit crazy.

1686
01:57:56,986 --> 01:58:01,823
I mean, anybody who's not
tearing their team down right now

1687
01:58:01,991 --> 01:58:05,118
and rebuilding it using your model,

1688
01:58:05,995 --> 01:58:07,829
they're dinosaurs.

1689
01:58:08,414 --> 01:58:12,834
They'll be sitting on their
ass on the sofa in October

1690
01:58:13,002 --> 01:58:16,505
watching the Boston Red
Sox win the World Series.

1691
01:58:21,886 --> 01:58:23,804
What's this?

1692
01:58:23,971 --> 01:58:27,474
I want you to be my general
manager. That's my offer.

1693
01:59:14,397 --> 01:59:15,897
Heads up.

1694
01:59:17,567 --> 01:59:18,567
What was that?

1695
01:59:19,819 --> 01:59:22,904
Sorry. I don't know.
What the hell was that?

1696
01:59:23,573 --> 01:59:25,907
You knucklehead.

1697
01:59:33,416 --> 01:59:34,749
How was Boston?

1698
01:59:36,294 --> 01:59:38,211
Impressive.

1699
01:59:44,635 --> 01:59:47,262
Did Henry make you a
good offer, at least?

1700
01:59:48,806 --> 01:59:51,892
Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
What was it? What was it?

1701
01:59:52,059 --> 01:59:53,685
Doesn't matter. What was it?

1702
02:00:16,751 --> 02:00:20,253
That makes you the highest-paid
GM in the history of sports.

1703
02:00:22,673 --> 02:00:24,132
So?

1704
02:00:25,968 --> 02:00:27,177
So what?

1705
02:00:30,223 --> 02:00:32,682
I made one decision in
my life based on money.

1706
02:00:32,850 --> 02:00:35,810
And I swore I would never do it again.

1707
02:00:38,397 --> 02:00:40,440
You're not doing it for the money.

1708
02:00:40,942 --> 02:00:43,443
No? No.

1709
02:00:45,446 --> 02:00:47,989
You're doing it for what the money says.

1710
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:53,119
And it says what it says to
any player that makes big money.

1711
02:00:53,788 --> 02:00:55,538
That they're worth it.

1712
02:01:04,006 --> 02:01:05,715
What a dump.

1713
02:01:09,887 --> 02:01:12,222
I really wanted to win here.

1714
02:01:16,269 --> 02:01:18,812
I really did.

1715
02:01:21,315 --> 02:01:23,483
I think you won pretty big, Billy.

1716
02:01:24,318 --> 02:01:26,444
Pete, we lost.

1717
02:01:28,030 --> 02:01:30,615
We lost.

1718
02:01:30,783 --> 02:01:34,244
It's only been a few days. Give
yourself some time to get over it.

1719
02:01:34,412 --> 02:01:37,747
Man, I don't get over these things.

1720
02:01:37,915 --> 02:01:39,040
Ever.

1721
02:01:46,048 --> 02:01:49,718
Come with me to the video room.
I wanna show you something.

1722
02:01:51,470 --> 02:01:54,764
No, man, I'm not up for film right now.

1723
02:01:56,017 --> 02:01:58,101
Come on. Seriously.

1724
02:01:58,269 --> 02:02:00,437
Come on, Billy. Come on.

1725
02:02:02,148 --> 02:02:03,273
The Visalia Oaks

1726
02:02:03,441 --> 02:02:06,234
and our 240-pound
catcher, Jeremy Brown,

1727
02:02:06,402 --> 02:02:10,030
who, as you know, is scared
to run to second base.

1728
02:02:10,197 --> 02:02:11,990
This was in a game six weeks ago.

1729
02:02:12,575 --> 02:02:14,701
This guy's gonna start with a fastball.

1730
02:02:14,869 --> 02:02:17,287
Jeremy's gonna take him to deep center.

1731
02:02:19,457 --> 02:02:20,957
Here's what's interesting,

1732
02:02:21,125 --> 02:02:24,002
because Jeremy's gonna
do what he never does.

1733
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:25,462
He's gonna go for it.

1734
02:02:25,629 --> 02:02:28,882
He's gonna round first
and he's gonna go for it.

1735
02:02:30,092 --> 02:02:31,384
Okay?

1736
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:39,642
This is all of Jeremy's
nightmares coming to life.

1737
02:02:42,104 --> 02:02:45,523
Aw, they're laughing at him. And
Jeremy's about to find out why.

1738
02:02:48,694 --> 02:02:51,071
Jeremy's about to realize

1739
02:02:52,531 --> 02:02:55,658
that the ball went 60
feet over the fence.

1740
02:02:58,287 --> 02:03:01,915
He hit a home run and
didn't even realize it.

1741
02:03:31,904 --> 02:03:34,948
How can you not be
romantic about baseball?

1742
02:03:39,870 --> 02:03:42,789
It's a metaphor. I know it's a metaphor.

1743
02:03:47,503 --> 02:03:48,878
Okay.

1744
02:03:52,967 --> 02:03:56,010
Pete, you're a good egg.

1745
02:03:59,432 --> 02:04:01,182
I'll call you.

1746
02:05:01,994 --> 02:05:05,580
Hey, Dad, this is the
song I told you I'd record.

1747
02:05:05,748 --> 02:05:08,458
Please don't show it to anyone else.

1748
02:05:08,626 --> 02:05:11,711
Let me know if you change your
mind and stay in California.

1749
02:05:11,879 --> 02:05:14,923
If not, you're a really great dad.

1750
02:05:20,262 --> 02:05:23,223
I'm just a little bit
Caught in the middle

1751
02:05:23,390 --> 02:05:26,601
Life is a maze And love is a riddle

1752
02:05:26,769 --> 02:05:31,564
I don't know where to go
Can't do it alone, I've tried

1753
02:05:31,732 --> 02:05:33,441
And I don't know why

1754
02:05:33,609 --> 02:05:36,277
I'm just a little
girl Lost in the moment

1755
02:05:36,445 --> 02:05:39,364
I'm so scared But I don't show it

1756
02:05:39,532 --> 02:05:43,117
I can't figure it out
It's bringing me down

1757
02:05:43,285 --> 02:05:48,039
I know I've got to let it go

1758
02:05:48,207 --> 02:05:50,458
And just enjoy the show

1759
02:05:50,626 --> 02:05:53,503
Slow it down, make it stop

1760
02:05:53,671 --> 02:05:57,090
Or else my heart Is going to pop

1761
02:05:57,258 --> 02:06:00,885
'Cause it's too much Yeah, it's a lot

1762
02:06:01,762 --> 02:06:04,347
To be something I'm not

1763
02:06:04,515 --> 02:06:08,101
I'm a fool, out of love

1764
02:06:08,269 --> 02:06:13,648
And I just can't get enough

1765
02:06:13,816 --> 02:06:16,818
I'm just a little bit
Caught in the middle

1766
02:06:16,986 --> 02:06:20,154
Life is a maze And love is a riddle

1767
02:06:20,322 --> 02:06:25,118
I don't know where to go
Can't do it alone, I've tried

1768
02:06:25,286 --> 02:06:26,953
And I don't know why

1769
02:06:27,121 --> 02:06:30,164
I'm just a little
girl Lost in the moment

1770
02:06:30,332 --> 02:06:33,668
I'm so scared But I don't show it

1771
02:06:33,836 --> 02:06:37,797
I can't figure it out
It's bringing me down

1772
02:06:37,965 --> 02:06:43,344
I know I've got to let it go

1773
02:06:43,512 --> 02:06:45,930
And just enjoy the show

1774
