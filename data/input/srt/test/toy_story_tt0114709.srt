1
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,644
All right, everyone!
This... is a stick-up!

2
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,354
Don't anybody move!

3
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,482
Now, empty that safe!

4
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,654
Money, money, money!

5
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:14,037
Stop it! Stop it,
you mean, old potato!

6
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:17,160
Quiet, Bo Peep,
or your sheep get run over!

7
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,370
Help! Baa!
Help us!

8
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:22,956
Oh, no, not my sheep!
Somebody do something!

9
00:01:29,338 --> 00:01:32,424
Reach for the sky!

10
00:01:32,508 --> 00:01:34,718
Oh, no! Sheriff Woody!

11
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:37,220
I'm here to stop you,
One-Eyed Bart.

12
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,973
How'd you know it was me?

13
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:41,767
Are you gonna come quietly?

14
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,059
You can't touch me, Sheriff!

15
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:46,438
I brought my attack dog
with the built-in force field.

16
00:01:46,522 --> 00:01:50,484
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force-field dogs.

17
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:54,696
Yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe!
You're going to jail, Bart!

18
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,616
Say goodbye to the wife
and Tater Tots.

19
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,502
You saved the day again, Woody.

20
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,128
You're my favourite deputy.

21
00:02:11,213 --> 00:02:13,714
You've got a friend in me

22
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,718
You've got a friend in me

23
00:02:17,802 --> 00:02:19,595
Come on,
let's wrangle up the cattle.

24
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:22,765
When the road looks rough ahead

25
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:26,685
And you're miles and miles
from your nice, warm bed

26
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,978
Round 'em up, cowboy!

27
00:02:28,063 --> 00:02:30,856
Just remember
what your old pal said

28
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:33,692
Boy, you've got a friend in me

29
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:34,985
Yee-haw!

30
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,947
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

31
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:39,657
Hey, cowboy!

32
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:43,577
Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am

33
00:02:43,703 --> 00:02:45,704
Big and stronger too

34
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:46,872
Come on, Woody.

35
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:48,040
Maybe

36
00:02:48,124 --> 00:02:52,836
But none of them will ever
love you the way I do

37
00:02:53,255 --> 00:02:55,755
It's me and you, boy

38
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:57,215
And as the years go by

39
00:02:57,299 --> 00:02:59,092
Whoa! Whoa!

40
00:02:59,176 --> 00:03:01,761
Our friendship will never die

41
00:03:04,014 --> 00:03:07,225
You're gonna see
It's our destiny

42
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:10,687
You've got a friend in me

43
00:03:10,771 --> 00:03:11,938
All right!

44
00:03:12,022 --> 00:03:14,399
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

45
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:15,900
Score!

46
00:03:16,777 --> 00:03:18,194
You got a friend in me

47
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:19,320
Wow! Cool!

48
00:03:19,405 --> 00:03:22,657
- What do you think?
- Oh, this looks great, Mom!

49
00:03:22,741 --> 00:03:24,033
Okay, birthday boy...

50
00:03:24,118 --> 00:03:26,160
We saw that at the store!
I asked you for it!

51
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:28,329
- I hope I have enough places.
- Wow, look at that! That's so...

52
00:03:28,414 --> 00:03:29,998
- One, two... Four.
- Oh, my gosh, you got...

53
00:03:30,082 --> 00:03:32,792
- Yeah, I think that's gonna be enough.
- Could we leave this up 'til we move?

54
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:34,794
- Well, sure! We can leave it up.
- Yeah!

55
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:36,921
Now go get Molly. Your friends
are gonna be here any minute.

56
00:03:37,006 --> 00:03:39,841
Okay. It's party? time, Woody.

57
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:43,260
Yee-haw!

58
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:50,934
Howdy, little lady.

59
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:57,274
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

60
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,942
Come on, Molly.

61
00:03:59,027 --> 00:04:00,152
Oh, you're getting heavy.

62
00:04:00,987 --> 00:04:02,237
See you later, Woody.

63
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:13,373
Pull my string!
The birthday party? 's today?

64
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:16,376
Okay, everybody,

65
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:17,836
coast is clear!

66
00:04:25,595 --> 00:04:27,554
Ages 3 and up. It's on my box.

67
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,557
Ages 3 and up. I'm not supposed
to be baby-sitting Princess Drool.

68
00:04:43,695 --> 00:04:44,695
Hey, Hamm.

69
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,907
- Look, I'm Picasso!
- I don't get it.

70
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:52,536
You uncultured swine! What're
you lookin' at, ya hockey puck?

71
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:59,710
- Hey, Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
- Sir! No, sir!

72
00:04:59,795 --> 00:05:02,713
Okay. Hey, thank you. At ease.

73
00:05:03,965 --> 00:05:05,424
Hey, uh, Slinky?

74
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:08,344
Right here, Woody.
I'm red this time.

75
00:05:08,428 --> 00:05:10,638
- No. Slink...
- Oh, well, all right.

76
00:05:10,722 --> 00:05:11,889
You can be red if you want.

77
00:05:11,973 --> 00:05:15,059
- Not now, Slink. I got some bad news.
- Bad news?

78
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:19,396
Just gather everyone up
for a staff meeting, and be happy.

79
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,480
Got it.

80
00:05:20,564 --> 00:05:21,898
Be happy!

81
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:25,652
Staff meeting, everybody!
Snake, Robot, podium duty.

82
00:05:26,278 --> 00:05:27,654
Hey.

83
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:32,575
Hey, Etch. Draw!

84
00:05:34,578 --> 00:05:36,746
Oh! Got me again.

85
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:40,500
Etch, you've been working on that draw.
Fastest knobs in the West.

86
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:43,586
Got a staff meeting, you guys.
Come on, let's go.

87
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,297
Now, where is that... Oh.

88
00:05:46,382 --> 00:05:48,925
Hey, who moved my doodle pad
way over here?

89
00:05:50,761 --> 00:05:54,556
- How're you doin', Rex?
- Were you scared? Tell me honestly.

90
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,516
I was close to being scared
that time.

91
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,186
I'm going for fearsome here,
but I just don't feel it.

92
00:06:00,271 --> 00:06:02,564
I think I'm just
coming off as annoying.

93
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:06,191
Oh, hi, Bo. Hi.

94
00:06:06,276 --> 00:06:08,861
I wanted to thank you, Woody,
for saving my flock.

95
00:06:08,945 --> 00:06:11,697
Oh, hey, it was, uh, nothin'.

96
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:16,076
What do you say I get someone else
to watch the sheep tonight?

97
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:18,287
Oh, yeah!

98
00:06:19,456 --> 00:06:23,709
Remember, I'm just
a couple of blocks away.

99
00:06:23,793 --> 00:06:25,586
- Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!
- Come on, come on.

100
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,962
Smaller toys up front.

101
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:30,883
Hey, Woody, come on.

102
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:38,390
Oh, thanks, Mike.

103
00:06:38,683 --> 00:06:40,559
Okay... Whoa, whoa. Step back.

104
00:06:40,643 --> 00:06:43,145
- For crying out loud.
- Thank you.

105
00:06:44,981 --> 00:06:47,566
Hello? Check.
That better? Great.

106
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,651
Everybody hear me? Up on the shelf,
can you hear me? Great.

107
00:06:50,736 --> 00:06:53,821
Okay. First item today...

108
00:06:54,656 --> 00:06:57,241
Oh, yeah.
Has everyone picked a moving buddy?

109
00:06:57,326 --> 00:06:59,911
- What?
- Moving buddy? You can't be serious.

110
00:06:59,995 --> 00:07:02,205
I didn't know we were
supposed to have one already.

111
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,665
Do we have to hold hands?

112
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,001
You guys think this is a big joke.

113
00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:09,504
We've only got one week
left before the move.

114
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:12,590
I don't want any toys left behind.
A moving buddy.

115
00:07:12,674 --> 00:07:15,218
If you don't have one, get one!

116
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:18,262
All right, next. Oh, yes.

117
00:07:18,347 --> 00:07:21,641
Tuesday night's plastic corrosion
awareness meeting

118
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:24,101
was, I think, a big success.

119
00:07:24,186 --> 00:07:27,355
And we wanna thank Mr Spell
for putting that on for us.

120
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,066
- Thank you, Mr Spell.
- You're welcome.

121
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,569
Okay. Oh, yes.
One minor note here.

122
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:36,280
Andy's birthday party
has been moved to today.

123
00:07:36,365 --> 00:07:38,073
Wait a minute here!

124
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:41,284
What do you mean the party? 's today?
His birthday's not 'til next week!

125
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:43,995
What's goin' on down there?
Is his mom losin' her marbles?

126
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,791
Well, obviously she wanted to
have the party? before the move.

127
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,626
I'm not worried.
You shouldn't be worried.

128
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,169
Of course Woody ain't worried.

129
00:07:51,254 --> 00:07:53,296
He's been Andy's favourite
since kindergarten.

130
00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:55,674
Hey, hey.
Come on, Potato Head.

131
00:07:55,758 --> 00:07:59,302
If Woody says it's all right, then,
well, darn it, it's good enough for me.

132
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:01,596
Woody has never
steered us wrong before.

133
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:05,308
Come on, guys. Every Christmas
and birthday we go through this.

134
00:08:05,393 --> 00:08:08,395
But what ifAndy gets
another dinosaur, a mean one?

135
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,481
I just don't think I could take
that kind of rejection!

136
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:13,859
Hey, listen,
no one's getting replaced.

137
00:08:13,943 --> 00:08:16,862
This is Andy
we're talking about.

138
00:08:16,946 --> 00:08:20,031
It doesn't matter
how much we're played with.

139
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:26,328
What matters is that we're here
for Andy when he needs us.

140
00:08:26,413 --> 00:08:28,455
That's what we're made for, right?

141
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:32,293
Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff
meeting, but... they're here!

142
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:34,128
Birthday guests at three o'clock!

143
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:36,338
Stay calm, everyone!

144
00:08:36,423 --> 00:08:37,882
Hey!

145
00:08:39,926 --> 00:08:40,926
Meeting adjourned.

146
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:43,429
Ho, boy! Will you take a look
at all those presents?

147
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:45,931
I can't see a thing.

148
00:08:49,185 --> 00:08:52,146
Yes, sir, we're next month's
garage sale fodder for sure.

149
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,065
- Any dinosaur-shaped ones?
- Oh, for crying out loud.

150
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,277
- They're all in boxes, you idiot.
- They're getting bigger.

151
00:08:58,361 --> 00:09:00,654
Wait, there's a nice
little one over there.

152
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:01,780
Hi!

153
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:06,952
- Spell, trash can.
- We're doomed!

154
00:09:07,037 --> 00:09:08,787
All right! All right!

155
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:12,540
If I send out the troops,
will you all calm down?

156
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:16,461
- Yes! Yes! We promise!
- Okay! Save your batteries.

157
00:09:16,545 --> 00:09:18,546
Very good, Woody.
That's using the old noodle.

158
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:25,136
Sergeant, establish
a recon post downstairs. Code Red!

159
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,680
- You know what to do.
- Yes, sir!

160
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:30,600
All right, men.
You heard him. Code Red!

161
00:09:30,684 --> 00:09:34,062
Repeat, we are at Code Red.
Recon plan Charlie. Execute!

162
00:09:34,146 --> 00:09:36,272
Let's move!
Move, move, move, move!

163
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,292
Yeah!

164
00:09:59,003 --> 00:10:00,504
Okay, come on, kids.

165
00:10:00,588 --> 00:10:03,507
Everyone in the living room.
It's almost time for the presents.

166
00:10:24,946 --> 00:10:27,280
All right, gangway, gangway.

167
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:30,575
And this is how we find out

168
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,869
what is in those presents.

169
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,584
Okay, who's hungry?

170
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,628
Here come the chips!

171
00:10:41,713 --> 00:10:44,171
I've got Cool Ranch
and barbecue!

172
00:10:44,715 --> 00:10:46,215
What in the world... Oh!

173
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:49,719
I thought I told him
to pick these up.

174
00:10:50,012 --> 00:10:52,430
Shouldn't they be there by now?
What's taking them so long?

175
00:10:52,514 --> 00:10:55,599
Hey, these guys are professionals.
They're the best.

176
00:10:56,268 --> 00:10:58,644
Come on!
They're not lying down on the job.

177
00:11:09,656 --> 00:11:11,824
Go on without me!
Just go!

178
00:11:11,908 --> 00:11:14,744
A good soldier never
leaves a man behind.

179
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,637
Okay, everybody, come on.

180
00:11:34,722 --> 00:11:37,682
Everybody settle down.
Now, kids. Everybody...

181
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:41,519
You sit in a circle. No, Andy.
Andy, you sit in the middle there.

182
00:11:41,604 --> 00:11:45,648
Good. And... Which present
are you gonna open first?

183
00:11:46,025 --> 00:11:48,777
- Mine!
- There they are.

184
00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:51,571
Come in, Mother Bird.
This is Alpha Bravo.

185
00:11:51,655 --> 00:11:53,907
- This is it! This is it! Quiet, quiet!
- Come in, Mother Bird.

186
00:11:53,991 --> 00:11:57,118
All right, Andy's opening
the first present now.

187
00:11:57,203 --> 00:12:00,038
Mrs Potato Head! Mrs Potato Head!
Mrs Potato Head!

188
00:12:00,873 --> 00:12:02,582
Hey, I can dream, can't I?

189
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,168
The bow's coming off.
He's ripping the wrapping paper.

190
00:12:05,252 --> 00:12:07,754
It's a... It's...
It's a... a lunch box.

191
00:12:07,838 --> 00:12:10,048
- We've got a lunch box here.
- A lunch box?

192
00:12:10,132 --> 00:12:11,925
- Lunch box?
- For lunch.

193
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:14,511
Okay, second present.
It appears to be...

194
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:17,471
- Okay, it's bed sheets.
- Who invited that kid?

195
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,812
Oh! Only one left.

196
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:27,606
- Okay, we're on the last present now.
- Last present!

197
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,067
It's a big one. It's a...

198
00:12:30,151 --> 00:12:32,694
- It's a board game! Repeat, Battleship!
- Whew!

199
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:34,988
Hallelujah!

200
00:12:35,073 --> 00:12:36,949
- Yeah! All right!
- Hey, watch it!

201
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:38,784
Sorry there, old spud head.

202
00:12:38,868 --> 00:12:42,621
Mission accomplished. Well done, men.
Pack it up. We're goin' home.

203
00:12:42,705 --> 00:12:45,040
So did I tell ya?
Nothin' to worry about.

204
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:48,544
I knew you were right all along, Woody.
Never doubted ya for a second.

205
00:12:49,254 --> 00:12:50,921
Wait a minute. Oh!

206
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:55,092
- What do we have here?
- Wait! Turn that thing back on!

207
00:12:55,176 --> 00:12:56,969
Come in, Mother Bird!
Come in, Mother Bird!

208
00:12:57,053 --> 00:12:59,763
Mom has pulled a surprise
present from the closet.

209
00:12:59,848 --> 00:13:02,266
Andy's opening it.
He's really excited about this one.

210
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,267
- Mom, what is it?
- It's a huge package.

211
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:07,311
Oh, get outta the... One of the kids
is in the way. I can't see.

212
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,356
- It's a...
- Wow!

213
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:14,861
It's a what? What is it?

214
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:17,780
- Oh, no!
- Oh, ya big lizard!

215
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:20,491
- Now we'll never know what it is!
- Way to go, Rex!

216
00:13:20,576 --> 00:13:22,535
No, no! Turn 'em around!
Turn 'em around!

217
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:25,121
He's puttin' 'em in backwa...
Here, you're puttin' 'em in backwards!

218
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:28,332
Plus is positive, minus is negative!
Oh, let me!

219
00:13:29,626 --> 00:13:31,836
Let's go to my room, guys!

220
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,755
Red alert! Red alert!
Andy is coming upstairs!

221
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:36,799
- There!
- Juvenile intrusion!

222
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:38,676
Repeat, resume
your positions now!

223
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,429
Andy's coming! Everybody,
back to your places! Hurry!

224
00:13:41,513 --> 00:13:43,514
Get to your places!
Get to your places!

225
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:45,933
Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear?
Did you see my ear?

226
00:13:46,018 --> 00:13:49,061
Out of my way! Here I come!
Here I come!

227
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,991
Hey, look, its lasers light up.
Take that, Zurg!

228
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:06,369
Quick, make a space.
This is where the spaceship lands.

229
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:08,622
And he does it like that.
And he does a karate chop action!

230
00:14:08,706 --> 00:14:11,625
Come on down, guys!
It's time for games!

231
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:13,752
We've got prizes!

232
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,514
- What is it?
- Can you see it?

233
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:30,936
- What the heck is up there?
- Woody, who's up there with ya?

234
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:34,189
Woody?

235
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:37,192
- What are you doing under the bed?
- Nothin'. Nothin'.

236
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,902
I'm sure Andy was just
a little excited, that's all.

237
00:14:39,986 --> 00:14:42,738
Too much cake and ice cream,
I suppose. It's just a mistake!

238
00:14:42,822 --> 00:14:46,617
Well, that mistake is sitting
in your spot, Woody.

239
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:49,870
- Have you been replaced?
- What did I tell you earlier?

240
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,789
No one is getting replaced.

241
00:14:51,873 --> 00:14:55,584
Now, let's all be polite and give
whatever it is up there

242
00:14:55,669 --> 00:14:59,338
a nice, big
Andy's-room welcome.

243
00:15:24,822 --> 00:15:26,114
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.

244
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:28,116
Come in, Star Command.

245
00:15:28,993 --> 00:15:31,077
Star Command, come in.
Do you read me?

246
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:34,414
Why don't they answer? My ship!

247
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:40,503
Blast! This'll take weeks to repair.

248
00:15:41,088 --> 00:15:44,132
Buzz Lightyear mission log,
stardate 4-0-7-2.

249
00:15:44,216 --> 00:15:47,510
My ship has run off course
en route to sector 12.

250
00:15:47,594 --> 00:15:50,096
I've crash-landed
on a strange planet.

251
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,682
The impact must've awoken me
from hypersleep.

252
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,520
Terrain seems a bit unstable.

253
00:15:58,272 --> 00:16:00,690
No readout yet
if the air is breathable.

254
00:16:00,774 --> 00:16:03,860
And there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.

255
00:16:03,944 --> 00:16:04,944
Hello!

256
00:16:06,113 --> 00:16:08,281
Whoa! Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

257
00:16:08,365 --> 00:16:10,658
Did I frighten you? Didn't mean to.

258
00:16:10,743 --> 00:16:13,160
Sorry. Howdy. My name is Woody.

259
00:16:13,244 --> 00:16:17,122
And this is Andy's room.
That's all I wanted to say.

260
00:16:17,206 --> 00:16:19,958
And also, there has been
a bit of a mix-up.

261
00:16:20,043 --> 00:16:22,336
This is my spot, see,
the bed here.

262
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,713
Local law enforcement.
It's about time you got here.

263
00:16:24,797 --> 00:16:27,799
I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger,
Universe Protection Unit.

264
00:16:27,884 --> 00:16:30,093
My ship has crash-landed here
by mistake.

265
00:16:30,178 --> 00:16:33,972
Yes, it is a mistake because,
you see, the bed here is my spot.

266
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:35,640
I need to repair
my turbo boosters.

267
00:16:35,725 --> 00:16:38,852
Do you people still use fossil fuel, or
have you discovered crystallic fusion?

268
00:16:38,936 --> 00:16:40,896
Well, let's see. We got double-A's.

269
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:43,357
Watch yourself!
Halt! Who goes there?

270
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:45,817
Don't shoot!
It's okay. Friends.

271
00:16:45,902 --> 00:16:49,654
- Do you know these life-forms?
- Yes! They're Andy's toys.

272
00:16:49,739 --> 00:16:52,115
All right, everyone,
you're clear to come up.

273
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,826
I am Buzz Lightyear.
I come in peace.

274
00:16:54,911 --> 00:16:58,246
Oh, I'm so glad
you're not a dinosaur!

275
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:00,498
Wh-why, thank you!

276
00:17:00,582 --> 00:17:03,292
Now, thank you all
for your kind welcome!

277
00:17:03,377 --> 00:17:06,128
- Say, what's that button do?
- I'll show you.

278
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,839
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

279
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:12,009
Hey, Woody's got something like that.
His is a pull string.

280
00:17:12,094 --> 00:17:14,345
- Only it's...
- Only it sounds like a car ran over it.

281
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:18,140
Oh, yeah, but not like this.
This is a quality sound system.

282
00:17:18,225 --> 00:17:19,767
Probably all copper wiring, huh?

283
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:23,104
So, where you from?
Singapore? Hong Kong?

284
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:27,441
Well, no. Actually, I'm stationed up
in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four.

285
00:17:27,776 --> 00:17:30,361
As a member of the elite
Universe Protection Unit

286
00:17:30,445 --> 00:17:31,862
of the Space Ranger Corps,

287
00:17:31,947 --> 00:17:34,657
I protect the galaxy
from the threat of invasion

288
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:38,828
from the evil Emperor Zurg,
sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.

289
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:41,330
Oh, really?
I'm from Playskool.

290
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,874
And I'm from Mattel.
Well, I'm not really from Mattel.

291
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:45,500
I'm actually from a smaller company

292
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:47,752
that was purchased
in a leveraged buyout.

293
00:17:48,129 --> 00:17:49,629
You'd think they'd never seen
a new toy before.

294
00:17:49,713 --> 00:17:51,381
Well, sure. Look at him.

295
00:17:51,465 --> 00:17:54,259
He's got more gadgets on him
than a Swiss Army knife.

296
00:17:56,053 --> 00:17:57,053
Please be careful.

297
00:17:57,138 --> 00:17:58,721
You don't want to be in the way
when my laser goes off.

298
00:17:58,806 --> 00:18:02,267
Hey, a laser! How come
you don't have a laser, Woody?

299
00:18:02,351 --> 00:18:05,311
It's not a laser! It's a...
It's a little light bulb that blinks.

300
00:18:05,396 --> 00:18:07,063
- What's with him?
- Laser envy.

301
00:18:07,148 --> 00:18:08,398
All right, that's enough!

302
00:18:08,482 --> 00:18:11,901
Look, we're all very impressed
with Andy's new toy.

303
00:18:11,986 --> 00:18:14,362
- Toy?
- T-O-Y. Toy!

304
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:18,408
Excuse me, I think the word
you're searching for is "Space Ranger."

305
00:18:18,492 --> 00:18:22,954
The word I'm searching for I can't say
because there's preschool toys present.

306
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:24,539
Gettin' kinda tense, aren't ya?

307
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,667
Mr Lightyear, now, I'm curious.

308
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:30,378
What does a Space Ranger
actually do?

309
00:18:30,462 --> 00:18:32,504
He's not a Space Ranger!

310
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:36,258
He doesn't fight evil
or, or shoot lasers or fly!

311
00:18:36,342 --> 00:18:37,759
Excuse me.

312
00:18:39,846 --> 00:18:42,264
Oh, impressive wingspan!
Very good!

313
00:18:42,348 --> 00:18:47,102
Oh, what? What?
These are plastic. He can't fly!

314
00:18:47,187 --> 00:18:50,647
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy,
and I can fly.

315
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:54,026
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.

316
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,110
- You can't.
- Can.

317
00:18:55,195 --> 00:18:56,904
Can't. Can't. Can't!

318
00:18:56,988 --> 00:18:59,448
I tell you, I could fly around
this room with my eyes closed!

319
00:18:59,532 --> 00:19:03,660
- Okay, then, Mr Light Beer, prove it.
- All right, then, I will.

320
00:19:03,745 --> 00:19:05,704
Stand back, everyone!

321
00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:16,131
To infinity and beyond!

322
00:19:42,741 --> 00:19:45,159
- Can!
- Whoa!

323
00:19:45,744 --> 00:19:48,454
Oh, wow, you flew magnificently!

324
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:52,667
- I found my movin' buddy.
- Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you.

325
00:19:52,751 --> 00:19:56,587
That wasn't flying!
That was... falling with style.

326
00:19:56,672 --> 00:19:59,840
Man, the dolls must really
go for you. Can you teach me that?

327
00:20:00,676 --> 00:20:03,844
- Golly bob howdy!
- Oh, shut up!

328
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:04,929
You know, in a couple of days,

329
00:20:05,013 --> 00:20:07,347
everything will be just the way
it was. They'll see.

330
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:09,099
They'll see.

331
00:20:10,434 --> 00:20:12,560
I'm still Andy's favourite toy.

332
00:20:13,271 --> 00:20:15,939
I was on top of the world
livin' high

333
00:20:16,023 --> 00:20:18,024
It was right in my pocket

334
00:20:20,278 --> 00:20:21,987
I was livin' the life

335
00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:25,448
Things were just the way
they should be

336
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,995
When from out of the sky
like a bomb

337
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,372
Comes some little punk
in a rocket

338
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:38,044
Now all of a sudden some
strange things are happening to me

339
00:20:38,129 --> 00:20:40,130
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

340
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:44,509
Strange

341
00:20:44,593 --> 00:20:46,970
Things are happening to me

342
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:52,474
Strange

343
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,728
Things

344
00:20:55,812 --> 00:21:01,025
Strange things are happening to me

345
00:21:01,484 --> 00:21:03,694
Ain't no doubt about it

346
00:21:09,492 --> 00:21:13,120
I had friends
I had lots of friends

347
00:21:13,204 --> 00:21:16,665
Now all my friends are gone

348
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,002
And I'm doin' the best I can

349
00:21:20,086 --> 00:21:21,920
To carry on

350
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:25,382
- I had power
- Power

351
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:27,843
- I was respected
- Respected

352
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,971
But not any more

353
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,766
And I've lost the love of the one

354
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,643
Whom I adore

355
00:21:37,228 --> 00:21:41,064
Let me tell you 'bout it
Strange

356
00:21:41,148 --> 00:21:43,941
Things are happenin' to me

357
00:21:45,486 --> 00:21:49,113
Strange

358
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:51,199
Things

359
00:21:52,701 --> 00:21:55,286
Strange

360
00:21:55,371 --> 00:21:58,122
Things are happenin' to me

361
00:21:58,207 --> 00:22:00,625
Ain't no doubt about it

362
00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:06,923
Strange

363
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:09,467
Things

364
00:22:10,594 --> 00:22:13,763
Strange

365
00:22:14,098 --> 00:22:15,890
Things

366
00:22:18,227 --> 00:22:19,727
Finally!

367
00:22:21,355 --> 00:22:22,772
Hey, who's got my hat?

368
00:22:22,856 --> 00:22:25,650
Look, I'm Woody!
Howdy, howdy, howdy!

369
00:22:27,652 --> 00:22:28,860
Gimme that!

370
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,613
Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog,
let me show you something.

371
00:22:31,697 --> 00:22:34,616
It looks as though I've been
accepted into your culture.

372
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,619
Your chief, Andy,
inscribed his name on me.

373
00:22:37,703 --> 00:22:38,745
Wow!

374
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,789
With permanent ink too!

375
00:22:40,873 --> 00:22:43,500
Well, I must get back
to repairing my ship.

376
00:22:47,088 --> 00:22:49,214
Don't let it get to you, Woody.

377
00:22:49,298 --> 00:22:51,675
Let what? I don't...
What do you mean? Who?

378
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:54,845
I know Andy's
excited about Buzz.

379
00:22:54,929 --> 00:22:58,306
But you know he'll always have
a special place for you.

380
00:22:58,391 --> 00:23:02,269
- Yeah, like the attic.
- All right, that's it!

381
00:23:03,771 --> 00:23:05,313
Unidirectional bonding strip.

382
00:23:05,398 --> 00:23:07,774
Mr Lightyear wants more tape.

383
00:23:10,194 --> 00:23:13,571
Listen, Light Snack,
you stay away from Andy.

384
00:23:13,655 --> 00:23:17,408
He's mine, and no one
is taking him away from me.

385
00:23:17,492 --> 00:23:19,034
What are you talking about?

386
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:21,662
Where's that bonding strip?

387
00:23:23,123 --> 00:23:24,248
And another thing,

388
00:23:24,332 --> 00:23:28,544
stop with this spaceman thing!
It's getting on my nerves!

389
00:23:28,628 --> 00:23:30,963
Are you saying you wanna lodge
a complaint with Star Command?

390
00:23:31,631 --> 00:23:35,009
Okay! Well, so you wanna
do it the hard way, huh?

391
00:23:35,135 --> 00:23:38,971
- Don't even think about it, cowboy.
- Oh, yeah, tough guy?

392
00:23:50,734 --> 00:23:52,443
The air isn't... toxic.

393
00:23:53,069 --> 00:23:56,113
How dare you open a spaceman's
helmet on an uncharted planet!

394
00:23:56,198 --> 00:23:59,533
My eyeballs could've been
sucked from their sockets!

395
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:04,662
You actually think
you're the Buzz Lightyear?

396
00:24:05,122 --> 00:24:07,749
Oh, all this time
I thought it was an act!

397
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:11,628
Hey, guys, look!
It's the real Buzz Lightyear!

398
00:24:11,712 --> 00:24:12,962
You're mocking me,
aren't you?

399
00:24:13,047 --> 00:24:15,798
Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
Buzz, look, an alien!

400
00:24:15,883 --> 00:24:17,300
Where?

401
00:24:25,017 --> 00:24:26,559
Yes!

402
00:24:30,064 --> 00:24:31,105
It's Sid!

403
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,941
Don't move!

404
00:24:33,025 --> 00:24:34,692
I thought he was at summer camp.

405
00:24:34,777 --> 00:24:36,861
They must've kicked him out
early this year.

406
00:24:37,363 --> 00:24:39,197
Oh, no, not Sid!

407
00:24:39,365 --> 00:24:40,865
Incoming!

408
00:24:42,868 --> 00:24:46,037
- Who is it this time?
- I... I can't... I can't tell.

409
00:24:46,121 --> 00:24:48,288
- Hey, where's Lenny?
- Right here, Woody.

410
00:24:48,373 --> 00:24:52,209
Oh, no, I can't bear to watch
one of these again.

411
00:24:52,293 --> 00:24:55,462
Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl.

412
00:24:55,547 --> 00:24:56,505
What's going on?

413
00:24:56,589 --> 00:25:00,300
Nothing that concerns you spacemen,
just us toys.

414
00:25:00,385 --> 00:25:01,885
I'd better take a look anyway.

415
00:25:03,012 --> 00:25:05,472
Why is that soldier
strapped to an explosive device?

416
00:25:05,557 --> 00:25:07,808
That's why, Sid.

417
00:25:08,935 --> 00:25:10,269
Sure is a hairy fellow.

418
00:25:10,353 --> 00:25:12,396
No, no, that's Scud, you idiot.

419
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,898
That is Sid.

420
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,902
- You mean that happy child?
- That ain't no happy child.

421
00:25:18,987 --> 00:25:22,239
He tortures toys, just for fun!

422
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,911
Well, then we've got
to do something.

423
00:25:28,413 --> 00:25:29,830
What are you doing?
Get down from there!

424
00:25:29,914 --> 00:25:33,166
- I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.
- Yeah, sure. You go ahead.

425
00:25:33,251 --> 00:25:35,626
Melt him with your scary laser.

426
00:25:35,711 --> 00:25:38,671
Be careful with that!
It's extremely dangerous.

427
00:25:38,755 --> 00:25:41,507
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it! Hit the dirt!

428
00:25:42,342 --> 00:25:44,385
Look out!

429
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:51,183
Yes! He's gone! He's history!

430
00:25:52,769 --> 00:25:54,353
I could've stopped him.

431
00:25:54,438 --> 00:25:57,607
Buzz, I would love
to see you try.

432
00:25:58,025 --> 00:26:00,151
Of course, I'd love
to see you as a crater.

433
00:26:01,236 --> 00:26:03,863
The sooner we move, the better.

434
00:26:03,947 --> 00:26:05,740
Yeah!

435
00:26:11,913 --> 00:26:13,789
To infinity and beyond!

436
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:17,126
All this packing
makes me hungry.

437
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,128
What would you say to dinner
at, oh, Pizza Planet?

438
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:23,131
Pizza Planet? Oh, cool!

439
00:26:23,924 --> 00:26:25,967
Go wash your hands,
and I'll get Molly ready.

440
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:29,346
- Can I bring some toys?
- You can bring one toy.

441
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:32,390
- Just one?
- One toy?

442
00:26:38,147 --> 00:26:39,856
Will Andy pick me?

443
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,445
"Don't count on it"?

444
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:09,176
Buzz! Oh, Buzz!
Buzz Lightyear.

445
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,595
Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness.
We've got trouble!

446
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,348
- Trouble? Where?
- Down there. Just down there.

447
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:17,184
A helpless toy, it's...
it's trapped, Buzz!

448
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:19,686
Then we've no time to lose.

449
00:27:25,527 --> 00:27:26,652
I don't see anything!

450
00:27:26,736 --> 00:27:28,946
Oh, he's there!
Just, just keep looking!

451
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,322
What kind of toy...

452
00:27:48,883 --> 00:27:50,092
Buzz!

453
00:27:50,176 --> 00:27:51,385
Buzz!

454
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,595
I don't see him in the driveway.

455
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,307
- I think he bounced into Sid's yard!
- Oh! Buzz!

456
00:28:00,644 --> 00:28:04,605
Hey, everyone, R.C.'s trying to
say something. What is it, boy?

457
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:08,401
- He's saying that this was no accident.
- What do you mean?

458
00:28:08,485 --> 00:28:10,903
- I mean Humpty-Dumpty was pushed...
- No!

459
00:28:10,988 --> 00:28:12,238
...by Woody!

460
00:28:12,322 --> 00:28:14,157
- What?
- Wait a minute.

461
00:28:14,241 --> 00:28:18,494
You don't think I meant to knock Buzz
out the window, do you? Potato Head?

462
00:28:18,579 --> 00:28:21,664
That's Mr Potato Head to you,
you back-stabbing murderer!

463
00:28:21,748 --> 00:28:23,833
Now, it was an accident, guys.

464
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:26,711
Come on.
Now, you, you gotta believe me.

465
00:28:26,795 --> 00:28:30,256
We believe ya, Woody.
Right, Rex?

466
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,842
Well, ye... N...
I don't like confrontations!

467
00:28:32,926 --> 00:28:36,596
Where is your honour, dirt bag?
You are an absolute disgrace!

468
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,306
You don't deserve to... Hey!

469
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:41,683
You couldn't handle Buzz cutting
in on your playtime, could you, Woody?

470
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:45,854
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz
just might be Andy's new favourite toy.

471
00:28:45,938 --> 00:28:47,230
So you got rid of him.

472
00:28:47,315 --> 00:28:50,025
Well, what ifAndy starts playing
with me more, Woody, huh?

473
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:52,027
You gonna knock me
outta the window too?

474
00:28:52,111 --> 00:28:54,237
I don't think we should
give him the chance.

475
00:28:54,405 --> 00:28:56,364
There he is, men. Frag him!

476
00:28:56,449 --> 00:28:57,949
Let's string him up
by his pull string!

477
00:28:58,034 --> 00:29:00,410
- I got dibs on his hat!
- Would you boys stop it!

478
00:29:00,495 --> 00:29:01,536
Tackle him!

479
00:29:01,621 --> 00:29:04,206
No, no, no! Wait!
I can explain everything!

480
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:07,209
Okay, Mom, be right down.
I've gotta get Buzz.

481
00:29:07,293 --> 00:29:08,418
Retreat!

482
00:29:13,382 --> 00:29:15,383
Mom, do you know
where Buzz is?

483
00:29:15,468 --> 00:29:16,968
No, I haven't seen him.

484
00:29:19,514 --> 00:29:23,016
- Andy, I'm heading out the door!
- But, Mom, I can't find him!

485
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,560
Honey, just grab some other toy.
Now, come on!

486
00:29:25,811 --> 00:29:27,645
Oh, okay.

487
00:29:32,692 --> 00:29:36,070
I couldn't find my Buzz.
I know I left him right there.

488
00:29:36,154 --> 00:29:39,156
Honey, I'm sure he's around.
You'll find him.

489
00:29:53,171 --> 00:29:55,923
It's too short!
We need more monkeys!

490
00:29:56,007 --> 00:29:59,093
There aren't any more!
That's the whole barrel!

491
00:30:00,387 --> 00:30:02,429
Buzz, the monkeys
aren't working!

492
00:30:02,514 --> 00:30:06,475
We're formulating another plan!
Stay calm!

493
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,519
Oh, where could he be?

494
00:30:20,197 --> 00:30:23,366
- Can I help pump the gas?
- Sure! I'll even let you drive.

495
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,451
- Yeah?
- Yeah, when you're 16.

496
00:30:26,203 --> 00:30:27,453
Funny, Mom.

497
00:30:27,538 --> 00:30:31,958
Great. How am I gonna convince
those guys it was an accident?

498
00:30:35,796 --> 00:30:37,589
Buzz!

499
00:30:39,216 --> 00:30:41,968
Buzz! Ha! You're alive!

500
00:30:42,052 --> 00:30:45,305
This is great!
Oh, I'm saved! I'm saved.

501
00:30:45,389 --> 00:30:47,890
Andy'll find you here,
he'll take us back to the room

502
00:30:47,975 --> 00:30:53,187
and then you can tell everyone
that this was all just a big mistake.

503
00:30:53,272 --> 00:30:56,065
Huh? Right? Buddy?

504
00:30:56,567 --> 00:30:59,527
I just want you to know that even
though you tried to terminate me,

505
00:30:59,612 --> 00:31:02,487
revenge is not an idea
we promote on my planet.

506
00:31:02,572 --> 00:31:06,617
- Oh. Well, that's good.
- But we're not on my planet, are we?

507
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:07,701
No.

508
00:31:14,292 --> 00:31:16,293
Okay, come on!

509
00:31:16,836 --> 00:31:18,545
You want a piece of me?

510
00:31:25,428 --> 00:31:28,138
Buzz, Buzz,
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.

511
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:31,141
- Next stop.
- Pizza Planet! Yeah!

512
00:31:33,978 --> 00:31:34,978
Andy!

513
00:31:43,738 --> 00:31:46,281
Wh... Doesn't he realise
that I'm not there?

514
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:49,950
I'm lost!

515
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,287
Oh, I'm a lost toy!

516
00:31:58,627 --> 00:31:59,919
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

517
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:03,381
The local sheriff and I seem to be at
a huge refuelling station of some sort.

518
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:04,507
You!

519
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:28,030
- According to my navi-computer, the...
- Shut up!

520
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:31,409
- Just shut up, you idiot!
- Sheriff, this is no time to panic.

521
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:35,078
This is the perfect time to panic.
I'm lost. Andy is gone.

522
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,372
They're gonna move from their house
in two days, and it's all your fault!

523
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:40,583
My... My fault? If you hadn't pushed me
out of the window in the first place...

524
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:41,751
Oh, yeah?

525
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:44,921
Well, if you hadn't shown up in your
stupid little cardboard spaceship

526
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,132
and taken away everything
that was important to me...

527
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:48,591
Don't talk to me
about importance!

528
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:51,720
Because of you the security
of this entire universe is in jeopardy!

529
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:54,264
What? What are
you talkin' about?

530
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:57,058
Right now, poised at
the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg

531
00:32:57,143 --> 00:32:58,768
has been secretly building
a weapon

532
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:02,105
with the destructive capacity
to annihilate an entire planet!

533
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:06,443
I alone have information that reveals
this weapon's only weakness.

534
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:08,737
And you, my friend,
are responsible

535
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:12,198
for delaying my rendezvous
with Star Command!

536
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:15,785
You... are... a... toy!

537
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,121
You aren't the real
Buzz Lightyear! You're a...

538
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:23,000
You're an action figure!
You are a child's plaything!

539
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:27,629
You are a sad, strange little man,
and you have my pity.

540
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,881
Farewell.

541
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:32,050
Oh, yeah?
Well, good riddance, ya loony!

542
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:34,470
"Rendezvous with Star Command."

543
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,098
- Hey, gas dude!
- You talkin' to me?

544
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,642
- Yeah, man. Can you help me?
- Pizza Planet? Andy!

545
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,686
Do you know
where Cutting Boulevard is?

546
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,146
Oh, no!

547
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,107
I can't show my face
in that room without Buzz.

548
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:50,110
- Buzz! Buzz, come back!
- Go away!

549
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,572
No! Buzz, you gotta
come back! I...

550
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,785
I found a spaceship!

551
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,663
It's a spaceship, Buzz!

552
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,752
Come on, man, hurry up! Like,
the pizzas are getting cold here!

553
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:10,463
- Cutting Boulevard, huh?
- Yeah, yeah. Which way?

554
00:34:10,547 --> 00:34:13,424
Now, you're sure this space freighter
will return to its port of origin

555
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,927
once it jettisons its food supply?

556
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:20,431
And when we get there, we'll be able
to find a way to transport you home.

557
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:24,060
- Well, then, let's climb aboard.
- No, no, no, wait, Buzz! Buzz!

558
00:34:24,144 --> 00:34:26,187
Let's get in the back.
No one will see us there.

559
00:34:26,271 --> 00:34:29,482
Negative. There are no restraining
harnesses in the cargo area.

560
00:34:29,566 --> 00:34:31,776
- We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
- Yeah, bu...

561
00:34:32,402 --> 00:34:34,153
Buzz! Buzz!

562
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,696
That's two lefts
and a right, huh?

563
00:34:35,781 --> 00:34:38,699
- Thanks for the directions, okay?
- Yeah. And remember, kid...

564
00:34:38,784 --> 00:34:40,201
Buzz!

565
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:55,507
It's safer in the cockpit
than the cargo bay. What an idiot.

566
00:35:20,324 --> 00:35:22,075
Next shuttle lift-off
is scheduled for

567
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:25,579
T-minus 30 minutes and counting.

568
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:31,167
You are clear to enter.

569
00:35:31,252 --> 00:35:33,044
Welcome to Pizza Planet.

570
00:35:34,338 --> 00:35:36,840
The white zone
is for immediate pizza...

571
00:35:37,425 --> 00:35:38,425
Sheriff!

572
00:35:40,177 --> 00:35:41,595
There you are.

573
00:35:42,178 --> 00:35:44,972
Now, the entrance is heavily guarded.
We need a way to get inside.

574
00:35:47,017 --> 00:35:48,267
Great idea, Woody.

575
00:35:48,351 --> 00:35:50,477
I like your thinkin'.

576
00:35:51,271 --> 00:35:54,440
You are clear to enter.
Welcome to Pizza Planet.

577
00:35:54,524 --> 00:35:56,191
Now!

578
00:35:56,276 --> 00:35:59,111
Quickly, Sheriff!
The air lock is closing.

579
00:35:59,195 --> 00:36:01,822
Jones, party of five,
your shuttle is now boarding...

580
00:36:01,907 --> 00:36:03,866
Hey, Mom,
can we have some tokens?

581
00:36:05,535 --> 00:36:06,577
Watch where you're going!

582
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:08,120
Sorry.

583
00:36:14,044 --> 00:36:18,339
...nine, eight, seven, six,

584
00:36:18,423 --> 00:36:21,508
five, four, three,

585
00:36:21,593 --> 00:36:23,552
two, one.

586
00:36:23,637 --> 00:36:27,181
What a spaceport!
Good work, Woody.

587
00:36:35,981 --> 00:36:38,816
Mom, can I play Black Hole?
Please, please, please?

588
00:36:38,901 --> 00:36:40,818
- Andy!
- Now, we need to find a ship

589
00:36:40,903 --> 00:36:44,322
- that's headed for Sector 12.
- Wait a minute. No, Buzz! This way.

590
00:36:44,406 --> 00:36:47,742
- There's a special ship. I just saw it.
- You mean it has hyperdrive?

591
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,453
Hyperactive hyperdrive.

592
00:36:50,537 --> 00:36:53,414
And Astro... turf!

593
00:36:53,499 --> 00:36:56,000
- Where is it? I don't see the...
- Come on. That's it.

594
00:36:56,085 --> 00:36:57,502
Spaceship!

595
00:36:59,296 --> 00:37:02,548
All right, Buzz, get ready.
And...

596
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:04,467
- And the universe explodes!
- Okay, Buzz, when I say go,

597
00:37:04,551 --> 00:37:07,220
we're gonna jump in the basket.
Buzz!

598
00:37:09,473 --> 00:37:10,932
- No!
- Mom, if I eat all my pizza,

599
00:37:11,016 --> 00:37:12,517
can I have some alien slime?

600
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:15,353
This cannot be happening to me.

601
00:37:24,779 --> 00:37:26,863
- A stranger.
- From the outside.

602
00:37:28,658 --> 00:37:31,535
Greetings. I am Buzz Lightyear.

603
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:34,037
I come in peace.

604
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:39,584
Before your space journey,
re-energise yourself

605
00:37:39,669 --> 00:37:43,296
with a slice of pepperoni,
now boarding at counter three.

606
00:37:44,215 --> 00:37:46,258
This is an intergalactic emergency.

607
00:37:46,342 --> 00:37:48,802
I need to commandeer
your vessel to Sector 12.

608
00:37:48,886 --> 00:37:51,263
Who's in charge here?

609
00:37:51,347 --> 00:37:54,182
The claw!

610
00:37:56,227 --> 00:37:57,519
The claw is our master.

611
00:37:57,603 --> 00:37:59,855
The claw chooses who will go
and who will stay.

612
00:37:59,939 --> 00:38:03,357
- This is ludicrous.
- Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there?

613
00:38:04,568 --> 00:38:05,860
Take that!

614
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:09,238
Oh, no! Sid!

615
00:38:09,656 --> 00:38:10,906
Get down!

616
00:38:13,285 --> 00:38:14,577
What's gotten into you? I was...

617
00:38:14,661 --> 00:38:16,829
You are the one that decided
to climb into this...

618
00:38:16,913 --> 00:38:19,331
The claw, it moves.

619
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:26,172
I have been chosen!

620
00:38:26,923 --> 00:38:29,884
Farewell, my friends.
I go on to a better place.

621
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,303
Gotcha!

622
00:38:34,056 --> 00:38:37,099
A Buzz Lightyear?
No way!

623
00:38:53,491 --> 00:38:55,075
Yes!

624
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,993
Buzz! No!

625
00:38:58,579 --> 00:38:59,704
Hey!

626
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:03,249
He has been chosen!

627
00:39:03,334 --> 00:39:04,959
- He must go.
- Hey!

628
00:39:05,044 --> 00:39:06,586
- What are you doing?
- Do not fight the claw.

629
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,797
Stop it! Stop it, you zealots!

630
00:39:12,343 --> 00:39:15,095
All right!
Double prizes!

631
00:39:17,807 --> 00:39:20,391
Let's go home and... play.

632
00:39:35,032 --> 00:39:36,907
Sheriff, I can see
your dwelling from here.

633
00:39:36,991 --> 00:39:39,118
- You're almost home.
- Nirvana is coming.

634
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:41,787
- The mystic portal awaits.
- Will you be quiet?

635
00:39:41,871 --> 00:39:43,330
You guys don't get it, do you?

636
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:46,708
Once we go into Sid's house,
we won't be coming out.

637
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:49,253
Whoa, Scud! Hey, boy!

638
00:39:49,337 --> 00:39:51,380
Sit! Good boy.

639
00:39:51,464 --> 00:39:54,258
- Hey, I got something for you, boy.
- Freeze!

640
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,929
Ready, set, now!

641
00:40:00,306 --> 00:40:02,808
Hannah!
Hey, Hannah!

642
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:05,018
- What?
- Did I get my package in the mail?

643
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:07,521
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

644
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:09,398
I don't know!

645
00:40:10,233 --> 00:40:13,193
- Oh, no, Hannah! Look, Janie!
- What? Hey!

646
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:15,070
- She's sick!
- No, she's not!

647
00:40:15,155 --> 00:40:17,614
I'll have to perform
one of my operations.

648
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:20,325
- No!
- No, not Sid's room. Not there.

649
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,286
Hey, give her back!

650
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:24,203
Sid! Sid!

651
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:28,416
Oh, no, we have
a sick patient here, nurse.

652
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,459
Prepare the OR, stat!

653
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:34,797
Patient is... prepped.

654
00:40:35,632 --> 00:40:40,386
No one's ever attempted a double
bypass brain transplant before.

655
00:40:41,471 --> 00:40:44,223
Now for the tricky part.
Pliers!

656
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:47,101
I don't believe that man's
ever been to medical school.

657
00:40:49,062 --> 00:40:51,731
Doctor, you've done it!

658
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:54,400
Hannah!

659
00:40:55,068 --> 00:40:56,485
Janie's all better now.

660
00:40:57,654 --> 00:41:01,199
- Mom! Mom!
- She's lying!

661
00:41:01,283 --> 00:41:03,910
Whatever she says,
it's not true!

662
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:19,090
We are gonna die.
I'm outta here!

663
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:25,388
Locked.

664
00:41:25,473 --> 00:41:27,682
There's gotta be another way
outta here.

665
00:41:39,862 --> 00:41:42,155
Buzz? Was that you?

666
00:41:51,749 --> 00:41:54,209
Hey, hi there, little fella.

667
00:41:54,293 --> 00:41:57,711
Come out here.
Do you know a way outta here?

668
00:42:27,742 --> 00:42:29,493
Buzz!

669
00:42:40,922 --> 00:42:42,923
They're cannibals.

670
00:42:46,093 --> 00:42:47,260
Mayday, mayday.

671
00:42:47,344 --> 00:42:49,595
Come in, Star Command.
Send reinforcements.

672
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,015
Star Command, do you copy?

673
00:42:52,433 --> 00:42:54,851
I've set my laser from stun to kill.

674
00:42:54,935 --> 00:42:59,105
Great. Great. Yeah, and if anyone
attacks us, we can blink 'em to death.

675
00:43:02,609 --> 00:43:04,652
Hey, you guys,
I think I found him!

676
00:43:04,737 --> 00:43:07,447
Buzz, is that you?

677
00:43:07,531 --> 00:43:09,532
Whiskers, will you
get outta here!

678
00:43:09,616 --> 00:43:12,493
You're interfering
with the search and rescue!

679
00:43:13,954 --> 00:43:15,788
Look, they're home.

680
00:43:20,961 --> 00:43:22,545
Mom, have you seen Woody?

681
00:43:22,629 --> 00:43:24,213
Where was the last place
you left him?

682
00:43:24,298 --> 00:43:25,548
Right here in the van.

683
00:43:25,632 --> 00:43:28,301
Oh, I'm sure he's there.
You're just not looking hard enough.

684
00:43:28,385 --> 00:43:30,886
He's not here, Mom.
Woody's gone.

685
00:43:32,138 --> 00:43:33,347
Woody's gone?

686
00:43:33,431 --> 00:43:35,390
Yeah, boy, the weasel ran away.

687
00:43:35,475 --> 00:43:37,559
Huh? Huh?
I told you he was guilty.

688
00:43:37,643 --> 00:43:41,897
Who would've thought he was
capable of such atrocities?

689
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:46,193
Oh, Slink,
I hope he's okay.

690
00:43:49,155 --> 00:43:54,242
Oh, a survivor.
Where's the rebel base? Talk!

691
00:43:56,662 --> 00:43:59,206
I can see your will is strong.

692
00:44:00,583 --> 00:44:04,002
Well, we have ways
of making you talk.

693
00:44:13,721 --> 00:44:16,931
Where are your rebel friends now?

694
00:44:17,682 --> 00:44:19,934
Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!

695
00:44:20,018 --> 00:44:21,644
All right!

696
00:44:33,448 --> 00:44:35,950
Are you all right?
I'm proud of you, Sheriff.

697
00:44:36,034 --> 00:44:38,702
A lesser man would've talked
under such torture.

698
00:44:39,496 --> 00:44:41,789
I sure hope this isn't permanent.

699
00:44:41,873 --> 00:44:45,126
Still no word from Star Command.
We're not that far from the space port.

700
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:47,628
The door. It's open!
We're free!

701
00:44:47,712 --> 00:44:48,838
Woody, we don't know
what's out there!

702
00:44:48,922 --> 00:44:50,214
I'll tell you wha...

703
00:44:52,467 --> 00:44:54,677
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!
Do something quick!

704
00:44:54,761 --> 00:44:56,595
Shield your eyes.

705
00:44:58,557 --> 00:45:01,392
It's not working. I recharged it
before I left. It should be good for...

706
00:45:01,476 --> 00:45:05,103
You idiot! You're a toy!
Use your karate chop action!

707
00:45:05,563 --> 00:45:07,897
- Get away!
- Hey! Hey! How're you doin' that?

708
00:45:07,982 --> 00:45:10,817
- Stop that.
- Back! Back, you savages! Back!

709
00:45:10,901 --> 00:45:14,612
- Woody, stop it!
- Sorry, guys, but dinner's cancelled!

710
00:45:14,947 --> 00:45:17,532
There's no place like home!
There's no place like home!

711
00:45:18,409 --> 00:45:20,076
There's no place like home.

712
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,634
Another stunt like that, cowboy,
you're gonna get us killed.

713
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:39,095
Don't tell me what to do.

714
00:45:58,448 --> 00:46:01,909
Yee-haw! Giddyap, pardner!

715
00:46:01,993 --> 00:46:04,786
We got to get this wagon train
a-movin'!

716
00:46:07,624 --> 00:46:08,916
Split up!

717
00:46:31,147 --> 00:46:33,440
Calling Buzz Lightyear.
Come in, Buzz Lightyear.

718
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,651
- This is Star Command.
- Star Command!

719
00:46:35,735 --> 00:46:38,236
- Buzz Lightyear, do you read me?
- Buzz Lightyear responding.

720
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,403
Read you loud and clear.

721
00:46:39,488 --> 00:46:41,989
Buzz Lightyear,
planet Earth needs your help.

722
00:46:42,074 --> 00:46:44,242
- On the way!
- Buzz Lightyear!

723
00:46:44,326 --> 00:46:48,829
The world's greatest superhero!
Now the world's greatest toy!

724
00:46:48,914 --> 00:46:51,874
Buzz has it all!
Locking wrist communicator!

725
00:46:51,959 --> 00:46:54,418
- Calling Buzz Lightyear!
- Karate chop action!

726
00:46:54,503 --> 00:46:56,504
- Wow!
- Pulsating laser light!

727
00:46:56,588 --> 00:46:59,966
- Total annihilation!
- Multi-phrase voice simulator!

728
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:02,176
There's a secret mission
in uncharted space.

729
00:47:02,261 --> 00:47:04,095
There's a secret mission
in uncharted space.

730
00:47:04,179 --> 00:47:07,431
And best of all,
high pressure space wings!

731
00:47:07,516 --> 00:47:11,227
- To infinity and beyond!
- Not a flying toy.

732
00:47:11,311 --> 00:47:12,937
Get your Buzz Lightyear action figure

733
00:47:13,021 --> 00:47:16,274
- and save a galaxy near you!
- Buzz Lightyear!

734
00:47:16,358 --> 00:47:19,860
Available at all Al's Toy Barn outlets
in the tri-county area.

735
00:47:21,196 --> 00:47:24,239
And welcome back to the Point
Richmond Bowling Championship.

736
00:47:27,326 --> 00:47:31,663
Out among the stars I sail

737
00:47:31,747 --> 00:47:34,457
Way beyond the moon

738
00:47:36,127 --> 00:47:40,505
In my silver ship I sailed

739
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:44,718
To a dream
that ended too soon

740
00:47:44,802 --> 00:47:47,637
Now I know exactly

741
00:47:47,722 --> 00:47:51,224
Who I am and what I'm here for

742
00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:54,728
You are a toy! You can't fly!

743
00:47:56,564 --> 00:48:01,067
And I will go sailing

744
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,779
No more

745
00:48:09,452 --> 00:48:13,412
But no, it can't be true

746
00:48:13,496 --> 00:48:16,665
I could fly if I wanted to

747
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,460
Like a bird in the sky

748
00:48:19,544 --> 00:48:22,379
If I believed I could fly

749
00:48:22,464 --> 00:48:25,090
Why, I'd fly

750
00:48:25,175 --> 00:48:27,968
To infinity and beyond!

751
00:48:43,777 --> 00:48:47,529
Clearly, I

752
00:48:47,614 --> 00:48:52,326
Will go sailing

753
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:54,995
No more

754
00:49:08,258 --> 00:49:11,552
Mom! Mom, have you seen
my Sally doll?

755
00:49:12,262 --> 00:49:14,472
What, dear? What was that?

756
00:49:15,057 --> 00:49:17,183
Never mind!

757
00:49:24,483 --> 00:49:27,318
Buzz, the coast is clear.
Buzz, where are you?

758
00:49:27,403 --> 00:49:30,905
There's a secret mission
in uncharted space. Let's go.

759
00:49:30,989 --> 00:49:34,325
Really?
That is so interesting.

760
00:49:35,577 --> 00:49:38,037
Would you like some tea,
Mrs Nesbitt?

761
00:49:38,664 --> 00:49:39,664
Buzz!

762
00:49:39,748 --> 00:49:42,625
It's so nice you could join us
on such late notice.

763
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:46,294
- Oh, no!
- What a lovely hat, Mrs Nesbitt.

764
00:49:46,379 --> 00:49:48,547
It goes quite well with your head.

765
00:49:49,465 --> 00:49:51,925
Hannah! Oh, Hannah!

766
00:49:52,009 --> 00:49:54,761
Mom? Please excuse me, ladies.

767
00:49:54,846 --> 00:49:56,638
I'll be right back.

768
00:49:59,392 --> 00:50:03,437
What is it, Mom?
Mom, where are you?

769
00:50:03,521 --> 00:50:06,022
Buzz. Hey.
Buzz, are you okay?

770
00:50:06,107 --> 00:50:09,276
Gone! It's all gone.

771
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,237
All of it's gone.
Bye-bye. See ya.

772
00:50:12,321 --> 00:50:13,363
What happened to you?

773
00:50:13,448 --> 00:50:16,116
One minute you're defending
the whole galaxy.

774
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:20,162
And suddenly you find yourself
suckin' down Darfeeling with

775
00:50:20,246 --> 00:50:23,415
Marie Antoinette
and her little sister.

776
00:50:25,334 --> 00:50:27,627
I think you've had
enough tea for today.

777
00:50:27,712 --> 00:50:29,463
Let's get you outta here, Buzz.

778
00:50:29,547 --> 00:50:32,506
Don't you get it?
You see the hat?

779
00:50:32,591 --> 00:50:37,553
- I am Mrs Nesbitt!
- Snap out of it, Buzz!

780
00:50:41,433 --> 00:50:43,642
I'm sorry. I...
You're right.

781
00:50:43,727 --> 00:50:46,604
I am just a little depressed.
That's all.

782
00:50:46,688 --> 00:50:48,731
I can get through this.

783
00:50:48,815 --> 00:50:50,608
Oh, I'm a sham!

784
00:50:50,692 --> 00:50:51,984
- Look at me.
- Quiet, Buzz.

785
00:50:52,068 --> 00:50:54,945
I can't even fly out of a window.

786
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:58,282
The hat looked good?
Tell me the hat looked good.

787
00:50:58,366 --> 00:51:01,160
- The apron is a bit much.
- "Out the window"!

788
00:51:01,244 --> 00:51:03,537
Buzz, you're a genius!

789
00:51:03,622 --> 00:51:04,955
Come on, come on. This way.

790
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,209
Years of academy, training, wasted!

791
00:51:09,419 --> 00:51:10,669
B-3.

792
00:51:10,754 --> 00:51:12,838
Miss! G-6.

793
00:51:12,923 --> 00:51:15,132
You sunk it. Are you peeking?

794
00:51:15,217 --> 00:51:18,510
Oh, quit your whinin' and pay up.
No, no, not the ear.

795
00:51:18,594 --> 00:51:21,054
- Give me the nose. Come on.
- How about three out of five?

796
00:51:22,431 --> 00:51:25,433
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!

797
00:51:26,101 --> 00:51:29,187
- Son of a building block. It's Woody.
- He's in the psycho's bedroom.

798
00:51:29,271 --> 00:51:31,689
- Hi!
- Everyone! It's Woody!

799
00:51:31,774 --> 00:51:32,774
- Woody?
- You're kidding!

800
00:51:32,858 --> 00:51:35,985
- Woody?
- We're gonna get outta here, Buzz.

801
00:51:36,487 --> 00:51:37,695
Buzz?

802
00:51:42,535 --> 00:51:44,160
- Hey, look!
- Woody!

803
00:51:44,245 --> 00:51:46,371
Oh, boy, am I glad
to see you guys.

804
00:51:46,455 --> 00:51:49,123
- I knew you'd come back, Woody.
- What are you doin' over there?

805
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:51,668
It's a long story, Bo.
I'll explain later.

806
00:51:51,752 --> 00:51:53,753
Here! Catch this!

807
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,340
- Whoa! I've got it, Woody.
- He got it, Woody.

808
00:51:57,424 --> 00:52:00,301
Good goin', Slink. Now just,
just tie it on to somethin'.

809
00:52:00,386 --> 00:52:02,887
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I got
a better idea. How 'bout we don't?

810
00:52:02,972 --> 00:52:04,305
- Hey!
- Potato Head.

811
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:06,348
Did you all take stupid pills
this morning?

812
00:52:06,432 --> 00:52:08,392
Have you forgotten
what he did to Buzz?

813
00:52:08,476 --> 00:52:10,018
And now you wanna let him
back over here?

814
00:52:10,103 --> 00:52:14,523
No! No, no, no, no, no! You got it...
You got it all wrong, Potato Head.

815
00:52:14,607 --> 00:52:16,942
Buzz is fine. Buzz is right here.
He's with me!

816
00:52:17,026 --> 00:52:20,320
- You are a liar!
- No, I'm not. Buzz, come over here.

817
00:52:20,405 --> 00:52:24,157
Tell the nice toys that you're...
that you're not dead.

818
00:52:27,036 --> 00:52:28,078
Just a sec!

819
00:52:28,162 --> 00:52:31,290
Buzz, will you get up here
and give me a hand?

820
00:52:33,793 --> 00:52:34,793
That's very funny, Buzz.

821
00:52:34,878 --> 00:52:37,963
- This is serious!
- Hey, Woody! Where'd ya go?

822
00:52:38,047 --> 00:52:40,132
He's lying. Buzz ain't there.

823
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:42,926
Oh! Hi, Buzz!

824
00:52:43,011 --> 00:52:46,096
Why don't you say hello
to the guys over there?

825
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:49,892
Hiya, fellas!
To infinity and beyond!

826
00:52:49,976 --> 00:52:51,768
Hey, look! It's Buzz!

827
00:52:51,853 --> 00:52:56,772
Hey, Buzz, let's show the guys
our new secret best friends handshake.

828
00:52:56,857 --> 00:52:58,190
Give me five, man!

829
00:52:58,275 --> 00:52:59,442
Something's screwy here.

830
00:52:59,526 --> 00:53:02,403
So you see we're friends now, guys.
Aren't we, Buzz?

831
00:53:02,487 --> 00:53:04,405
You bet. Give me a hug.

832
00:53:05,532 --> 00:53:06,949
Boy, I love you too.

833
00:53:07,034 --> 00:53:08,618
See? It is Buzz.

834
00:53:08,702 --> 00:53:10,328
Now give back the lights,
Potato Head.

835
00:53:10,412 --> 00:53:11,871
Wait just a minute.

836
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:14,498
- What are you tryin' to pull?
- Nothing!

837
00:53:18,503 --> 00:53:20,546
- Oh, that is disgusting.
- Murderer!

838
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:22,715
- No! No, no, no, no, no!
- You murdering dog!

839
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:25,134
- It's not what you think. I swear!
- Save it for the jury.

840
00:53:25,218 --> 00:53:27,803
I hope Sid pulls
your voice box out, ya creep.

841
00:53:27,888 --> 00:53:29,805
No, no! No, no!
Don't leave! Don't leave!

842
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:32,850
Ya gotta help us, please! You don't
know what it's like over here!

843
00:53:32,935 --> 00:53:34,268
Come on.
Let's get outta here.

844
00:53:34,353 --> 00:53:36,979
Go back to your lives, citizens.
Show's over.

845
00:53:37,064 --> 00:53:39,648
Come back! Slink!

846
00:53:39,732 --> 00:53:43,652
Slink! Please!
Please! Listen to me!

847
00:53:43,736 --> 00:53:46,988
No! No! Come back!

848
00:53:47,073 --> 00:53:49,574
Slinky!

849
00:53:58,334 --> 00:54:00,835
Buzz! Go away!

850
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,629
You disgusting freaks!

851
00:54:04,048 --> 00:54:06,383
All right, back!
Back, you cannibals!

852
00:54:11,138 --> 00:54:14,808
He is still alive, and you're
not gonna get him, you monsters!

853
00:54:14,892 --> 00:54:16,685
What are you doin'?

854
00:54:19,605 --> 00:54:21,690
Hey. Hey, they fixed you.

855
00:54:25,277 --> 00:54:26,819
But they're cannibals.

856
00:54:26,903 --> 00:54:29,446
We saw them eat
those other toys.

857
00:54:37,706 --> 00:54:40,332
Sorry. I thought
that you were gonna...

858
00:54:41,167 --> 00:54:43,002
You know, you know, eat my friend.

859
00:54:43,294 --> 00:54:45,170
Hey, no, no, wait, hey!

860
00:54:45,255 --> 00:54:46,672
- What's wrong?
- Sid?

861
00:54:46,756 --> 00:54:48,424
Not now, Mom! I'm busy!

862
00:54:48,508 --> 00:54:50,926
- Sid! Buzz, come on!
- You left that door open.

863
00:54:51,011 --> 00:54:55,431
Get up! Use your legs! Fine!
Let Sid trash you! But don't blame me!

864
00:54:57,726 --> 00:55:00,978
It came!
It finally came!

865
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:05,816
"The Big One."

866
00:55:08,778 --> 00:55:11,238
"Extremely dangerous.

867
00:55:11,322 --> 00:55:14,032
"Keep out of reach of children."

868
00:55:15,325 --> 00:55:18,578
Cool! What am I gonna blow?

869
00:55:18,662 --> 00:55:21,539
Man. Hey, where's
that wimpy cowboy doll?

870
00:55:35,929 --> 00:55:40,850
Yes. I've always wanted
to put a spaceman into orbit.

871
00:55:50,652 --> 00:55:52,779
Now. Yes.

872
00:55:57,201 --> 00:55:59,159
Oh, no!

873
00:56:01,704 --> 00:56:03,371
Oh, man!

874
00:56:10,046 --> 00:56:11,797
Sid Phillips reporting.

875
00:56:11,881 --> 00:56:13,423
Launch of the shuttle
has been delayed

876
00:56:13,508 --> 00:56:16,176
due to adverse weather
conditions at the launch site.

877
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:19,137
Tomorrow's forecast, sunny.

878
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,349
Sweet dreams.

879
00:56:27,688 --> 00:56:31,233
I looked everywhere, honey,
but all I could find was your hat.

880
00:56:31,317 --> 00:56:33,485
But what if we
leave them behind?

881
00:56:33,569 --> 00:56:35,320
Oh, don't worry, honey.

882
00:56:35,404 --> 00:56:38,824
I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz
before we leave tomorrow.

883
00:56:47,249 --> 00:56:48,415
I need air!

884
00:56:49,084 --> 00:56:50,584
Will you quit movin' around?

885
00:56:50,669 --> 00:56:54,296
I'm sorry. It's just that I get...
I get so nervous before I travel.

886
00:56:54,381 --> 00:56:56,799
How did I get stuck
with you as a moving buddy?

887
00:56:56,883 --> 00:56:59,051
Everyone else was picked.

888
00:57:05,767 --> 00:57:07,143
Oh, Woody.

889
00:57:08,228 --> 00:57:12,064
If only you could see
how much Andy misses you.

890
00:57:26,204 --> 00:57:27,705
Hey, Buzz!

891
00:57:34,295 --> 00:57:38,131
Hey. Get over here and see if
you can get this toolbox off me.

892
00:57:40,843 --> 00:57:43,678
Oh, come on, Buzz, I...

893
00:57:43,762 --> 00:57:47,891
Buzz, I can't do this without you.
I need your help.

894
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,770
I can't help.
I can't help anyone.

895
00:57:52,855 --> 00:57:55,732
Why, sure you can, Buzz.
You can get me outta here.

896
00:57:55,816 --> 00:57:59,152
Then I'll get that rocket off you, and
we'll make a break for Andy's house.

897
00:57:59,236 --> 00:58:02,739
Andy's house, Sid's house.
What's the difference?

898
00:58:02,823 --> 00:58:06,910
Oh, Buzz. You've had a big fall.
You must not be thinking clearly.

899
00:58:06,994 --> 00:58:10,455
No, Woody. For the first time
I am thinking clearly.

900
00:58:10,539 --> 00:58:13,208
You were right all along.
I'm not a Space Ranger.

901
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:17,503
I'm just a toy, a stupid,
little, insignificant toy.

902
00:58:17,588 --> 00:58:18,838
Whoa, hey, wait a minute.

903
00:58:18,923 --> 00:58:22,341
Bein' a toy is a lot better
than bein' a, a Space Ranger.

904
00:58:22,425 --> 00:58:24,760
- Yeah, right.
- No, it is.

905
00:58:24,844 --> 00:58:27,888
Look, over in that house is a kid
who thinks you are the greatest.

906
00:58:27,972 --> 00:58:30,641
And it's not because
you're a Space Ranger, pal.

907
00:58:30,725 --> 00:58:34,603
It's because you're a toy.
You are his toy.

908
00:58:34,687 --> 00:58:36,271
But why would Andy want me?

909
00:58:36,356 --> 00:58:41,652
Why would Andy want you?
Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear.

910
00:58:41,736 --> 00:58:44,446
Any other toy would give up
his moving parts just to be you.

911
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:48,075
You've got wings.
You glow in the dark. You talk!

912
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:51,536
Your helmet does
that, that, that whoosh thing.

913
00:58:52,121 --> 00:58:54,706
You are a cool toy.

914
00:58:58,211 --> 00:59:01,046
As a matter of fact,
you're too cool.

915
00:59:01,631 --> 00:59:04,883
I mean, I mean, what chance
does a toy like me have

916
00:59:04,968 --> 00:59:08,261
against a Buzz Lightyear
action figure?

917
00:59:08,345 --> 00:59:10,930
All I can do is...

918
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:15,434
There's a snake in my boots.

919
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:17,812
Why would Andy ever want
to play with me

920
00:59:17,896 --> 00:59:20,606
when he's got you?

921
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:25,069
I'm the one that should be
strapped to that rocket.

922
00:59:47,843 --> 00:59:50,928
Listen, Buzz, forget about me.

923
00:59:51,013 --> 00:59:53,930
You should get outta here
while you can.

924
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:07,235
Buzz? What are you doin'?
I thought you were...

925
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:10,363
Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid
over in that house who needs us.

926
01:00:10,448 --> 01:00:12,407
Now let's get
you out of this thing.

927
01:00:12,491 --> 01:00:13,867
Yes, sir!

928
01:00:16,454 --> 01:00:18,580
Come on, Buzz.
We can do it.

929
01:00:24,628 --> 01:00:26,379
Woody, it's the moving van.

930
01:00:26,464 --> 01:00:28,631
We gotta get outta here now.

931
01:00:33,471 --> 01:00:35,096
Come on, Buzz.

932
01:00:36,682 --> 01:00:37,891
All right.

933
01:00:39,352 --> 01:00:42,144
- Hey, I'm out!
- Almost there.

934
01:00:47,192 --> 01:00:49,485
I want to ride the pony.

935
01:00:53,656 --> 01:00:57,201
Woody? Woody?
Are you all right?

936
01:00:58,078 --> 01:01:00,662
I'm fine. I'm okay.

937
01:01:11,216 --> 01:01:14,676
Oh, yeah!
Time for lift-off!

938
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:20,516
To infinity and beyond!

939
01:01:29,691 --> 01:01:31,734
Back, back.

940
01:01:31,819 --> 01:01:33,569
Down, down!

941
01:01:34,238 --> 01:01:36,322
Okay, what do I do?
Come on, Woody. Think.

942
01:01:39,701 --> 01:01:40,701
Guys!

943
01:01:42,413 --> 01:01:44,956
No, no, no, no! Wait!
Wait. Listen, please.

944
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,374
There's a good toy down there,

945
01:01:46,458 --> 01:01:49,585
and he's gonna be blown
to bits in a few minutes.

946
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:53,214
All because of me.
We gotta save him.

947
01:01:53,298 --> 01:01:56,050
And...
But I need your help.

948
01:02:03,308 --> 01:02:06,102
Please. He's my friend.

949
01:02:07,146 --> 01:02:09,522
And he's the only one I've got.

950
01:02:22,743 --> 01:02:26,413
Thank you.
Okay, I think I know what to do.

951
01:02:26,497 --> 01:02:28,582
We're gonna have
to break a few rules.

952
01:02:28,666 --> 01:02:31,793
But if it works,
it'll help everybody.

953
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:45,474
Houston to Mission Control.
Come in, Control.

954
01:02:45,766 --> 01:02:48,935
Launch pad is being constructed.

955
01:02:50,646 --> 01:02:51,855
All right, listen up.

956
01:02:51,939 --> 01:02:54,733
I need Pump Boy here,
Ducky here.

957
01:02:54,817 --> 01:02:57,527
Legs, you're with Ducky.

958
01:02:58,279 --> 01:03:00,946
RollerBob and I don't move
'til we get the signal. Clear?

959
01:03:02,115 --> 01:03:04,492
Okay. Let's move!

960
01:03:25,388 --> 01:03:26,514
Wind the frog.

961
01:03:48,702 --> 01:03:50,828
Wait for the signal.

962
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:07,720
Go!

963
01:04:11,350 --> 01:04:13,184
All right, let's go!

964
01:04:13,686 --> 01:04:15,228
I'll get it!

965
01:04:15,312 --> 01:04:16,521
Now!

966
01:04:17,231 --> 01:04:19,023
I'm coming. I'm coming.

967
01:04:29,034 --> 01:04:30,368
Scud!

968
01:04:34,539 --> 01:04:36,206
Stupid dog.

969
01:04:43,965 --> 01:04:45,507
Lean back!

970
01:04:50,388 --> 01:04:53,849
Mission Control, is the
launch pad construction complete?

971
01:04:53,933 --> 01:04:56,476
Roger. Rocket is now
secured to guide wire.

972
01:04:56,561 --> 01:05:00,147
We are currently obtaining
the ignition sticks.

973
01:05:00,231 --> 01:05:01,982
Countdown will commence
momentarily.

974
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:04,318
- Stand by.
- Let's go.

975
01:05:04,402 --> 01:05:08,655
Hey, Ma! Where are the matches?
Oh, wait. Here they are. Never mind.

976
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:11,199
Woody! Great!
Help me outta this thing.

977
01:05:11,743 --> 01:05:15,162
- What?
- It's okay. Everything's under control.

978
01:05:16,748 --> 01:05:17,914
Woody, what are you doing?

979
01:05:17,999 --> 01:05:22,251
Houston. All systems are go.
Requesting permission to launch...

980
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:25,630
Hey? How'd you get out here?

981
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:30,343
Oh, well. You and I
can have a cookout later.

982
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,390
Houston, do we have
permission to launch?

983
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:38,976
Roger. Permission granted.

984
01:05:39,061 --> 01:05:43,189
You are confirmed
at "T" minus ten seconds.

985
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:47,026
And counting.
Ten, nine,

986
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,862
eight, seven, six,

987
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:53,074
five, four, three, two,

988
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:57,286
- one!
- Reach for the sky!

989
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:02,166
This town ain't big enough
for the two of us.

990
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,542
What?

991
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:06,212
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

992
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:10,298
- It's busted.
- Who are you callin' busted, buster?

993
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:12,384
That's right.

994
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:16,179
I'm talking to you, Sid Phillips.

995
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:19,057
We don't like bein' blown up, Sid,

996
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:21,101
or smashed or ripped apart.

997
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:24,646
- "We"?
- That's right! Your toys!

998
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:26,981
Mama!

999
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:28,817
Mama!

1000
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:32,487
Mama! Mama!

1001
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:55,592
Mama!

1002
01:06:56,511 --> 01:07:00,723
From now on, you must take
good care of your toys!

1003
01:07:00,807 --> 01:07:04,893
Because if you don't,
we'll find out, Sid.

1004
01:07:05,395 --> 01:07:11,316
We toys can see everything.

1005
01:07:12,485 --> 01:07:14,862
So play nice.

1006
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:24,663
We did it! We did it! Yes!

1007
01:07:24,748 --> 01:07:27,374
The toys!
The toys are alive!

1008
01:07:27,667 --> 01:07:29,126
Nice toy.

1009
01:07:32,964 --> 01:07:34,298
What's wrong, Sid?

1010
01:07:34,382 --> 01:07:37,134
Don't you want to play with Sally?

1011
01:07:38,261 --> 01:07:40,471
Nice work, fellows.
Good job.

1012
01:07:40,555 --> 01:07:43,139
Comin' out of the ground, what a touch.
That was a stroke of genius.

1013
01:07:43,223 --> 01:07:44,932
Woody.

1014
01:07:46,393 --> 01:07:47,727
Thanks.

1015
01:07:49,521 --> 01:07:51,314
Everybody say, "Bye, house!"

1016
01:07:51,398 --> 01:07:53,691
- Woody! The van!
- Bye, house.

1017
01:07:56,612 --> 01:07:58,279
We gotta run! Thanks, guys!

1018
01:08:01,825 --> 01:08:03,075
Quick!

1019
01:08:08,207 --> 01:08:10,166
Just go. I'll catch up.

1020
01:08:31,521 --> 01:08:32,771
Come on!

1021
01:08:48,287 --> 01:08:50,121
You can do it, Woody!

1022
01:08:52,375 --> 01:08:54,125
I got it!

1023
01:08:54,836 --> 01:08:56,294
I made it.

1024
01:09:00,716 --> 01:09:03,718
Get away,
you stupid dog! Down!

1025
01:09:03,803 --> 01:09:06,388
- Down!
- Hold on, Woody!

1026
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,058
I can't do it.

1027
01:09:11,102 --> 01:09:13,478
Take care ofAndy for me!

1028
01:09:13,563 --> 01:09:15,104
No!

1029
01:09:16,481 --> 01:09:17,898
Buzz!

1030
01:09:45,176 --> 01:09:46,260
Are we there already?

1031
01:09:46,344 --> 01:09:47,928
- Woody?
- How did you...?

1032
01:09:48,013 --> 01:09:49,305
- How'd he get here?
- Where have you...?

1033
01:09:49,389 --> 01:09:50,639
What happened?

1034
01:09:50,724 --> 01:09:52,850
- What's goin' on?
- What's he takin'?

1035
01:09:53,685 --> 01:09:54,977
There you are!

1036
01:09:55,061 --> 01:09:56,937
Hey. What's he doing?

1037
01:10:00,025 --> 01:10:01,775
He's at it again!

1038
01:10:13,203 --> 01:10:15,371
- Get him!
- Come on!

1039
01:10:24,214 --> 01:10:25,506
No, no!

1040
01:10:29,303 --> 01:10:31,554
No, no, no, no! Wait!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1041
01:10:39,730 --> 01:10:41,439
Pig pile!

1042
01:11:03,503 --> 01:11:05,837
- Get outta that car!
- Move it!

1043
01:11:08,049 --> 01:11:10,008
No! Please!
You don't understand!

1044
01:11:10,093 --> 01:11:12,135
Buzz is out there.
We gotta help him.

1045
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:14,554
- No!
- Toss him overboard!

1046
01:11:14,639 --> 01:11:16,390
No, no, no! Wait!

1047
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:21,395
- Hooray!
- So long, Woody!

1048
01:11:26,943 --> 01:11:28,568
Oh! Woody!

1049
01:11:28,945 --> 01:11:31,947
- Oh! Well, thanks for the ride.
- Look out!

1050
01:11:35,659 --> 01:11:38,077
Now let's catch up
to that truck.

1051
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:48,087
Guys! Guys! Woody's riding R.C.

1052
01:11:48,171 --> 01:11:50,297
- What?
- And Buzz is with him!

1053
01:11:54,594 --> 01:11:55,720
It is Buzz!

1054
01:11:55,804 --> 01:11:57,805
Woody was telling the truth.

1055
01:11:57,889 --> 01:12:01,267
- What have we done?
- Great! Now I have guilt.

1056
01:12:01,351 --> 01:12:03,477
We're almost there!

1057
01:12:04,688 --> 01:12:06,897
Rocky, the ramp!

1058
01:12:14,656 --> 01:12:16,032
Look out!

1059
01:12:16,825 --> 01:12:19,201
Quick! Hold onto my tail!

1060
01:12:24,331 --> 01:12:29,335
- Attaboy, Slink!
- Oh! Woody!

1061
01:12:29,795 --> 01:12:30,754
Woody! Speed up!

1062
01:12:30,838 --> 01:12:32,756
- Speed up!
- The batteries!

1063
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,507
They're runnin' out!

1064
01:12:50,524 --> 01:12:54,819
- I can't hold on much longer.
- Slink! Hang on!

1065
01:13:10,585 --> 01:13:11,835
Great!

1066
01:13:14,672 --> 01:13:16,507
Woody! The rocket!

1067
01:13:16,591 --> 01:13:19,134
The match! Yes!

1068
01:13:19,219 --> 01:13:21,095
Thank you, Sid!

1069
01:13:28,228 --> 01:13:30,312
No! No, no! No!

1070
01:13:30,396 --> 01:13:33,899
No! Oh, no!

1071
01:13:33,983 --> 01:13:37,820
No, no, no, no, no,

1072
01:13:37,904 --> 01:13:39,655
no!

1073
01:13:39,739 --> 01:13:41,448
No!

1074
01:13:50,416 --> 01:13:53,585
- Woody! What are you doing?
- Hold still, Buzz!

1075
01:13:56,213 --> 01:13:57,338
You did it!

1076
01:13:57,714 --> 01:13:59,298
Next stop, Andy!

1077
01:13:59,383 --> 01:14:03,469
Wait a minute. I just lit a rocket.
Rockets explode!

1078
01:14:14,064 --> 01:14:16,524
I should have held on longer.

1079
01:14:16,608 --> 01:14:19,735
Look! Look! It's Woody
and Buzz comin' up fast!

1080
01:14:20,696 --> 01:14:22,238
Woody!

1081
01:14:31,248 --> 01:14:32,707
Take cover!

1082
01:14:40,007 --> 01:14:42,133
This is the part
where we blow up!

1083
01:14:42,217 --> 01:14:43,633
Not today!

1084
01:14:55,188 --> 01:14:57,397
Hey, Buzz!
You're flyin'!

1085
01:14:57,481 --> 01:15:00,775
This isn't flying.
This is falling with style.

1086
01:15:03,654 --> 01:15:07,741
To infinity and beyond!

1087
01:15:13,956 --> 01:15:15,999
Buzz, we missed the truck.

1088
01:15:16,083 --> 01:15:18,168
We're not aiming for the truck.

1089
01:15:24,926 --> 01:15:25,926
Hey, wow!

1090
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:28,220
- What? What is it?
- Woody! Buzz!

1091
01:15:28,304 --> 01:15:30,304
Oh, great, you found them.
Where were they?

1092
01:15:30,388 --> 01:15:32,473
- Here in the car!
- See?

1093
01:15:32,557 --> 01:15:35,851
Now, what'd I tell you?
Right where you left 'em.

1094
01:15:44,527 --> 01:15:48,113
- Which one can I open first?
- Let's let Molly open one.

1095
01:15:53,995 --> 01:15:55,287
Frankincense, this is Myrrh.

1096
01:15:55,372 --> 01:15:57,706
Hey, heads up, everybody.
It's show time.

1097
01:15:57,791 --> 01:15:59,667
Whoa! It's time!

1098
01:16:01,711 --> 01:16:03,128
Oh, Bo.

1099
01:16:03,213 --> 01:16:05,631
There's got to be a less painful way
to get my attention.

1100
01:16:05,715 --> 01:16:07,800
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.

1101
01:16:08,927 --> 01:16:11,345
Say, isn't that mistletoe?

1102
01:16:13,848 --> 01:16:17,350
Maybe Andy will get another dinosaur.
Like a leaf eater.

1103
01:16:17,434 --> 01:16:20,812
That way I could play
the dominant predator.

1104
01:16:20,896 --> 01:16:21,938
Quiet, everyone! Quiet!

1105
01:16:22,022 --> 01:16:25,692
Molly's first present
is Mrs Potato Head.

1106
01:16:25,776 --> 01:16:27,819
Repeat, a Mrs Potato Head.

1107
01:16:27,903 --> 01:16:29,988
Way to go, Idaho!

1108
01:16:30,072 --> 01:16:32,115
Gee, I'd better shave.

1109
01:16:36,829 --> 01:16:38,204
Come in, Frankincense.

1110
01:16:38,289 --> 01:16:40,290
Andy is now opening
his first present.

1111
01:16:40,374 --> 01:16:43,167
- It's...
- Buzz. Buzz Lightyear,

1112
01:16:43,252 --> 01:16:45,211
- you are not worried, are you?
- I can't quite...

1113
01:16:45,296 --> 01:16:46,713
- Me? No, no.
- Make out...

1114
01:16:46,797 --> 01:16:49,465
No. No, no, no, no.

1115
01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:51,884
A large box... It's...

1116
01:16:51,969 --> 01:16:54,554
- Are you?
- Now, Buzz,

1117
01:16:54,638 --> 01:16:58,891
what could Andy possibly get
that is worse than you?

1118
01:17:00,269 --> 01:17:01,978
Oh, what is it? What is it?

1119
01:17:02,062 --> 01:17:03,979
Wow! A puppy!

1120
01:17:19,037 --> 01:17:22,289
You've got a friend in me

1121
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:26,626
You've got a friend in me

1122
01:17:27,837 --> 01:17:31,006
When the road looks rough ahead

1123
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:35,927
And you're miles and miles
from your nice, warm bed

1124
01:17:36,012 --> 01:17:39,431
You just remember
what your old pal said

1125
01:17:39,515 --> 01:17:42,309
Boy, you've got a friend in me

1126
01:17:43,811 --> 01:17:47,481
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

1127
01:17:52,861 --> 01:17:55,863
You've got a friend in me

1128
01:17:57,074 --> 01:17:59,658
You've got a friend in me

1129
01:18:01,328 --> 01:18:05,372
- You got troubles
- And I got 'em too

1130
01:18:05,457 --> 01:18:09,502
There isn't anything
I wouldn't do for you

1131
01:18:09,586 --> 01:18:12,588
If we stick together
we can see it through

1132
01:18:12,672 --> 01:18:16,008
'Cause you've got a friend in me

1133
01:18:17,844 --> 01:18:20,387
You've got a friend in me

1134
01:18:22,182 --> 01:18:26,185
Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am

1135
01:18:26,269 --> 01:18:29,271
Bigger and stronger too

1136
01:18:29,356 --> 01:18:30,439
Maybe

1137
01:18:30,524 --> 01:18:36,153
But none of them will ever love you
the way I do

1138
01:18:36,238 --> 01:18:38,822
It's me and you, boy

1139
01:18:38,906 --> 01:18:42,325
And as the years go by

1140
01:18:42,409 --> 01:18:45,495
Our friendship will never die

1141
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:51,876
You're gonna see it's our destiny

1142
01:18:51,961 --> 01:18:55,922
You've got a friend in me

1143
01:18:56,006 --> 01:18:58,550
You've got a friend in me

1144
01:19:00,219 --> 01:20:40,775
You've got a friend in me
