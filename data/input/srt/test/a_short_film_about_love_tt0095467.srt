00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,800
A SHORT FILM ABOUT LOVE

2
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,700
What's your pension number?

3
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,600
What?

4
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,200
I said what's your pension number.

5
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,300
That's ok.

6
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,800
Money order notice

7
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,500
- Nothing.
- But there's the notice.

8
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,400
There is nothing...
see for yourself.

9
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,400
When should I come?

10
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,600
Perhaps when you get another notice.

11
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,100
Hey!

12
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,200
Your notice.

13
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,700
Bloody mess!

14
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,300
- Miss Poland is on.
- I'm studying.

15
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
Come and watch.

16
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,900
Great, thanks.

17
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:19,300
My name is Maugojata.
I'm 24 years old...

18
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,300
Entry number six, Miss...

19
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,100
I'm Katajina.

20
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,300
I'm 20 years old.
I'm graduated from Medical College.

21
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Hello?

22
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,100
Hello?

23
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,800
Enough of this idiocy.
Who is it?

24
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,500
I hear you breathing.
You bastard.

25
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,900
Hello?

26
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,300
I'm sorry.

27
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,300
Milk wasn't delivered.

28
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,900
- I get it only every other day.
- Would you like to deliver milk?

29
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,600
- I haven't time.
- Neither has the milkman.

30
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:59,700
He sends you his best wishes...
and "SSIA"...

31
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,100
what's that?

32
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
A code.

33
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,400
He'll see the world. Pity you
couldn't go with him.

34
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,700
I'm not sorry.

35
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,200
From Marcin.

36
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,300
What will happen to you when
he gets back?

37
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,800
I'd like to see you settled down.

38
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:43,000
Marcin likes travelling. I'm afraid
he won't stay home for long.

39
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,800
Maybe you could go on
living here.

40
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,700
Gas emergency.

41
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,400
I want to report a gas leak.

42
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,400
- You're sure of it?
- I can smell it and hear it.

43
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,200
- Where's it leaking from?
- The cooker.

44
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:35,800
- What address?
- Piratowka, flat 376.

45
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,500
We'll be there soon.

46
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,900
Marcin wrote...

47
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,400
he went to the cinema with
an Arab girl.

48
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,100
I wonder what they saw.

49
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,200
Tomek.

50
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,400
Are you seeing somebody?

51
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,800
No.

52
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,100
I'm not sure whether you have
been told this.

53
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:34,000
Girls only pretend to be casual,
they kiss boys easily...

54
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,300
but in fact...
they like tenderness.

55
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:47,300
If you'd like to bring
someone here...

56
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,200
you needn't be shy about it.

57
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,700
I haven't anyone.

58
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,700
I'll wait.

59
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,700
How are you?

60
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,700
What do you want?

61
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,000
I heard you need someone
to deliver milk.

62
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,100
Do you want to deliver milk?
How old are you?

63
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,900
- Nineteen.
- A student?

64
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,600
No. I work in our post office.

65
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,100
You realize you must get up at five?

66
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,100
I get up early, anyway.

67
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800
- Hello?
- The milkman.

68
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,500
You didn't put a bottle out.

69
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,700
That's right.

70
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,000
Son of a bitch!

71
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,400
Tomek.

72
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,800
Tomek.

73
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Not asleep?

74
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,700
Come and sit down.

75
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,400
Is something wrong?

76
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,700
Why do people cry?

77
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,600
Don't you know?
Haven't you ever cried?

78
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,200
Once, long ago.

79
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,000
When you were left?

80
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,500
People cry...

81
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,400
for various reasons.

82
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,900
When someone dies, when they're
left alone...

83
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,200
When they...
can't stand it anymore.

84
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,900
What?

85
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,900
Living. When they're hurt.

86
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,700
Can you do anything about it?

87
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,500
Once Marcin had toothache

88
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,900
he heated the iron and
pressed it here.

89
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,800
He forgot about the tooth.

90
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,400
You before, wasn't it?

91
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,600
So?

92
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,800
Another notice.

93
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,800
Nothing.

94
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,600
- It's the second time.
- Yes, but there's nothing.

95
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,800
A mess, eh?

96
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,800
Really?

97
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,300
Could you ask someone
more senior?

98
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,600
What?

99
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,900
The manager, or someone.

100
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,700
Wait a minute please.

101
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,700
What's the matter?

102
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,700
I don't know who's sent me money, but
this is the second notice I've had.

103
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,500
No money is here.

104
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,200
You got the notice.

105
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,000
But not any money.

106
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,500
Give that notice to me.

107
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,900
Who did you expect money from?

108
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,000
No idea... 24,000...

109
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,800
So how did you know it was due?

110
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,700
I got two notices, didn't I?

111
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,800
But there's no money.

112
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,900
- So why was I sent notices?
- Mr. Bachek!

113
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,900
Mr. Bachek!

114
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,400
What's the matter, sir?

115
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,700
What notices are these?

116
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,100
Well, notices.

117
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:09,100
- It's your round. Did you issue them?
- No, I write in pencil.

118
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,400
They were in my box.

119
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,000
Not from us.

120
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:18,000
But they were in my box,
your stamp is on them.

121
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,500
This is a state post office!

122
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,500
If you write your own notices...

123
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,300
it's a police matter.

124
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,800
Right. Give me the notices.

125
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,400
No, they're forgeries.

126
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
You wanted to swindle us.

127
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,400
What do you want?

128
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,600
I want to tell you
there was no money.

129
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,800
- What about the notices?
- I sent them.

130
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,700
Why? I don't understand.

131
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,300
I wanted to see you.

132
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,100
You wanted to see me?

133
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,400
You were crying yesterday.

134
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,900
How do you know?

135
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,100
I peeped at you.

136
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,300
What?

137
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,600
I watched you through the window.

138
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:16,100
Clear off... you meddler!

139
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,900
Hello.

140
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,200
I'll count to three.

141
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:21,900
One...

142
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,100
- Two...
- Hello.

143
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,700
Are you looking?

144
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,500
Yes.

145
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,900
I've moved the bed, see?

146
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,500
Yes.

147
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,600
Have fun.

148
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,100
Hey!

149
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,300
You shit!

150
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,100
Postman!

151
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,500
Come here!

152
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:29,600
Come here, you bastard!

153
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,100
You, sweetheart?

154
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,000
Put up your hands.

155
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
Don't do it again.

156
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Very unhealthy at your age.

157
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,700
Will you sleep?

158
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,700
I thought it would be you.

159
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,100
Want to come in? No one's here.

160
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,500
Everything in good order?

161
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,400
You look terrific.

162
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,300
Don't you know how to fight?

163
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,900
Why are you peeping at me?

164
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,100
Because I love you.

165
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,800
I really do.

166
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,400
And what do you want?

167
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,600
I don't know.

168
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,100
- Do you want to kiss me?
- No.

169
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,600
Perhaps you want to
make love to me?

170
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,300
No.

171
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,000
Want to go away with me?

172
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,000
- To the lakes, or to Budapest?
- No.

173
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,000
So what do you want?

174
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,700
Nothing.

175
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,700
Nothing?

176
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,500
Yes.

177
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:38,400
Could I invite you out to a cafe...
ice-cream...

178
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:04,900
Sorry.

179
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,300
Have you been watching long?

180
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,300
A year.

181
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:39,200
This morning...

182
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,400
what was it you said?

183
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,700
- I love you.
- There's no such thing.

184
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,100
There is.

185
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,600
No.

186
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:04,500
Apart from loving me and working in
the post office, what do you do?

187
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,100
I study languages.

188
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,200
- What have you learned?
- Bulgarian.

189
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,900
Bulgarian?
Great, but what for?

190
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,100
We had two Bulgarians in
the orphanage.

191
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:25,400
Then English, French, Italian.

192
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,300
Now I'm learning Portuguese.

193
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,800
- You're a strange one.
- No, I have a good memory.

194
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:36,200
I remember
everything from the start.

195
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,300
Even when you were born?

196
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,700
- I think so, sometimes.
- And your parents?

197
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,200
Not them.

198
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:58,900
Remember a thin boy who used to
visit me in the autumn?

199
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,400
Yes, he brought milk and rolls
and took away parcels.

200
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,500
That's right. He never came back.

201
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,400
I liked him.

202
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,000
So did l, but he left...

203
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,900
for Austria, then Australia.

204
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,200
Australia?

205
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,200
Yes.

206
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:43,600
I've been removing your letters.
I didn't know they were from him.

207
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,000
I work at the post office.

208
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:10,700
You besiege me, you bring the milk
you send me false notices...

209
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:14,900
you send gas workers, you pinch my letters.

210
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,000
But it doesn't really matter.

211
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,000
Haven't you any friends?

212
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,100
One, but he's not here now.

213
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,400
Where is he?

214
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,800
He's with the UN Force in Syria.

215
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,700
I lodge with his mother, opposite.

216
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,900
He's different from me.

217
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,200
I think so.

218
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,400
He peeped at you, too.

219
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,800
What did he tell you?

220
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,600
Before he left he showed me your
window and gave me his opera glasses.

221
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,000
- What did he tell you?
- SSIA.

222
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,900
What's it stand for?

223
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,500
Go ahead.

224
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,300
She...

225
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,500
She?

226
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,700
Quickly!

227
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,300
She spreads it around.

228
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,700
That's okay.

229
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,100
What would you like?

230
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,800
I don't like ice-cream.
But I'll eat.

231
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,900
- I'll have ice-cream.
- It's off.

232
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,900
What, then?

233
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,400
- Tea.
- We've got that.

234
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,000
I'd like red wine.

235
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,600
Two glasses of red wine, and tea.
- Okay.

236
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:49,600
Give me your hand.

237
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,500
Caress me.

238
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:27,600
Look there!

239
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:37,200
They seem to know more about it.

240
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,600
Our bus.

241
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,600
I have a good idea.

242
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:12,800
If we catch it, you're coming to
my place. If not, no. Agreed?

243
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,300
Let's go!

244
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,900
Such snow-scenes are
embroidered, too.

245
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,000
Do I always do that?

246
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,900
Not that I've seen.

247
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,600
Not everything's routine.

248
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Where did you get that?

249
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:49,100
It's a souvenir. It's yours now.

250
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,400
I'm not good.

251
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,900
Don't give it to me.

252
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,100
You know I'm not good.

253
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,200
Really.

254
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,900
I don't care. I love you.

255
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,300
What else do you know?

256
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,300
What do you see when one
of them is with me?

257
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,100
It's called... making love.

258
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,400
I don't watch that any more.

259
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:08,500
It has nothing to do with love.
Tell me what I do.

260
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,200
You undress.

261
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:24,400
Then you undress them.

262
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:30,500
You go to bed, or on the floor.

263
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,100
And?

264
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,300
Or in the kitchen.

265
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,500
You close your eyes...

266
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:48,100
then you lift your hands...
above your head.

267
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:52,500
Show me how. Go on.

268
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,100
- Have you had a girl?
- No.

269
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,100
And when you watch me
do you do it with yourself?

270
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:34,200
I used to. Not now.

271
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:42,800
You know it's sinful.

272
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,800
Now...

273
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,500
I think only about you.

274
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:08,300
I have nothing underneath
you know, don't you?

275
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,900
When a woman wants a man...

276
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,200
she becomes wet inside.

277
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,900
I'm wet now.

278
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:33,100
Such delicate hands.

279
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:35,700
Don't be afraid.

280
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,100
Already?

281
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,500
That's all there is to love.

282
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,200
Wash in the bathroom
there's a towel.

283
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,500
I'm sorry. Please come back.

284
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,200
Go back.

285
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:37,800
Sorry.

286
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,000
Did I wake you up?

287
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:41,800
No.

288
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,100
I'm looking for...

289
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,300
He left his coat.

290
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,800
Come in.

291
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,200
Leave it there.

292
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:31,000
Is he out?

293
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:31,900
No.

294
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:36,100
- He's in hospital.
- What happened?

295
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:43,600
Nothing serious.
He'll be out in a few days.

296
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:51,100
I'd like to visit him.
He just left my place...

297
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,200
I know.

298
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:58,500
I think that... I have hurt him.

299
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:03,700
Don't visit him, he will be back.

300
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:09,100
What happened?

301
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,700
You'll probably find it funny.

302
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,500
He fell in love with you.

303
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:38,400
He watched you through this.

304
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,100
Stolen, probably.

305
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,200
He used opera-glasses before.

306
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:51,600
And he set this alarm-clock
for half-past eight.

307
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:55,100
- You come home then, don't you?
- About then.

308
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,200
He made a bad choice?

309
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,000
Yes.

310
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:19,900
I don't need much, but I'm afraid
without someone in the house.

311
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,400
Good night.

312
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:35,800
- May I phone, to enquire?
- We haven't a telephone.

313
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:50,100
I'm sorry.

314
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:52,900
- What is his name?
- Tomek.

315
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,100
Tomek.

316
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:01,600
Tomek.

317
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,600
Closed.

318
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,400
What is this?

319
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:47,200
Don't delete anything
without making notes.

320
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:23,900
Excuse me.

321
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:27,600
- Number?
- 376.

322
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,800
Nothing.

323
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:37,600
Do you know what happened to
the young man who worked
in your branch?

324
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:44,700
It seems he cut his wrists out of love.

325
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:53,400
Do you know his name?

326
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:57,300
You'll have to ask the manageress.
I don't know.

327
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,500
Hello?

328
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,700
Hello!

329
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:53,800
Tomek? Say something.

330
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,400
I've looked for you everywhere.

331
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:20,800
I've looked for you in several
hospitals, to tell you...

332
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:25,100
you were right.

333
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:27,400
Tomek.

334
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:31,100
Do you hear me? You were right.

335
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:39,500
I don't know what to say to you.
I don't know how...

336
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:50,500
Hello?

337
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,900
- Maria Magdlena?
- I'm Magda.

338
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,100
I'm Boytush.

339
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,900
Was it you just now?

340
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,300
Yeah, but it didn't hook up.

341
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:00,400
- Did you hear what I said?
- No.

342
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:01,800
I have a problem with Viola...

343
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:31,100
Excuse me, is he back?

344
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:34,400
Not yet.

345
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,200
Is he back?

346
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,100
Yes.

347
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:13,600
I'd like to talk...

348
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,000
Just a minute...
