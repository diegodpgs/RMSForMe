1
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:07,025
She isn't coming yet,
Toto. Did she hurt you?

2
00:02:07,693 --> 00:02:11,964
She tried to, didn't she? Come on.
We'll go tell Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.

3
00:02:21,206 --> 00:02:23,041
Aunt Em! Aunt Em!

4
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:26,979
Aunt Em, just listen to
what Miss Gulch did to Toto!

5
00:02:27,045 --> 00:02:29,948
-Dorothy, please! We're trying
to count! -But she hit him-

6
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:33,418
Don't bother us now, honey.
This old incubator's gone bad...

7
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:36,255
...and we're likely to
lose a lot of our chicks.

8
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:38,624
The poor little things.

9
00:02:38,857 --> 00:02:42,327
Miss Gulch hit Toto on the back
with a rake just because she says...

10
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:45,931
...he gets in her garden and
chases her nasty old cat every day!

11
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:47,566
Dorothy, please!

12
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:50,802
But he doesn't do it every
day, just once or twice a week.

13
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:54,806
He can't catch her old cat, anyway!
And now she says she's going to-

14
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:56,675
Dorothy! We're busy!

15
00:02:59,144 --> 00:03:00,579
All right.

16
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:05,250
How's she coming?

17
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:06,552
Take it easy.

18
00:03:08,053 --> 00:03:09,488
You got my finger!

19
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:11,790
Why don't you get your
finger out of the way?

20
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,292
There you are.

21
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:16,562
-Right on my finger!
-It's a lucky thing it wasn't your head.

22
00:03:16,628 --> 00:03:18,864
Zeke, what am I going
to do about Miss Gulch?

23
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:23,035
-Just because Toto chases her old cat-
-Listen, honey, I got them hogs to get in.

24
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:25,637
Dorothy, you ain't using
your head about Miss Gulch.

25
00:03:25,704 --> 00:03:29,007
-You'd think you didn't have any brains.
-I have so got brains!

26
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:30,442
Why don't you use them?

27
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:32,711
When you come home
don't go by her place...

28
00:03:32,778 --> 00:03:36,782
...then Toto won't get in her garden
and you won't get in no trouble.

29
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,818
Hunk, you just won't
listen, that's all.

30
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:42,721
Well, your head ain't
made of straw, you know.

31
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:48,894
Get in there before I
make a dimebank out of you!

32
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,098
Listen, kid...

33
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:57,903
Are you going to let that old
Gulch heifer try and buffalo you?

34
00:03:58,203 --> 00:04:01,673
She ain't nothing to be afraid of.
Have a little courage, that's all.

35
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,108
I'm not afraid of her.

36
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:06,245
The next time she squawks, walk
up to her and spit in her eye.

37
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:07,746
That's what I'd do!

38
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:15,687
Zeke, get me out of here! Help!

39
00:04:18,557 --> 00:04:20,025
Are you all right, Dorothy?

40
00:04:20,092 --> 00:04:21,693
Yes, I'm all right.

41
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:24,096
I fell in and Zeke...

42
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:29,501
Why, Zeke, you're
just as scared as I am!

43
00:04:29,735 --> 00:04:33,071
You gonna let a little old
pig make a coward out of you?

44
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:34,573
Look at you, Zeke-

45
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,409
What's all this jabber-wapping
when there's work to be done?

46
00:04:37,476 --> 00:04:40,646
I know three farm hands who'll be
out of a job before they know it!

47
00:04:40,712 --> 00:04:41,947
Dorothy was walking-

48
00:04:42,014 --> 00:04:45,584
I saw you tinkering with that
contraption. You two get back to the wagon!

49
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:46,885
All right, Mrs. Gale.

50
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:49,888
Someday they're going to erect
a statue to me in this town-

51
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:51,990
Don't start posing for it now.

52
00:04:52,357 --> 00:04:56,528
Here, can't work on an empty stomach.
Have some crullers. Just fried.

53
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,700
-Dorothy toppled into- -It's no
place for Dorothy around a pigsty!

54
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:05,170
Now, you go feed those hogs before
they worry themselves into anemia!

55
00:05:05,237 --> 00:05:09,207
Do you know what Miss Gulch
said she was going to do to Toto?

56
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:12,411
Now, Dorothy, stop
imagining things.

57
00:05:12,477 --> 00:05:15,113
You always get yourself
into a fret over nothing.

58
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,251
Help us out today and find a place
where you won't get into any trouble.

59
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:25,190
Some place where there
isn't any trouble.

60
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,727
Do you suppose there
is such a place, Toto?

61
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:31,063
There must be.

62
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:36,568
It's not a place you can
get to by a boat or a train.

63
00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:40,739
It's far, far away...

64
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:43,909
...behind the moon...

65
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:46,445
...beyond the rain...

66
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:52,584
<i>~ Somewhere, over
the rainbow... ~</i>

67
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:56,688
<i>~ ...way up high ~</i>

68
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:03,495
<i>~ There's a land
that I heard of... ~</i>

69
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:07,132
<i>~ ...once in a lullaby ~</i>

70
00:06:09,534 --> 00:06:14,539
<i>~ Somewhere, over
the rainbow... ~</i>

71
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:18,644
<i>~ ...skies are blue ~</i>

72
00:06:20,812 --> 00:06:25,817
<i>~ And the dreams that
you dare to dream ~</i>

73
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:29,421
<i>~ Really do come true ~</i>

74
00:06:31,456 --> 00:06:35,394
<i>~ Someday I'll
wish upon a star ~</i>

75
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,465
<i>~ And wake up where the
clouds are far behind me ~</i>

76
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:46,438
<i>~ Where troubles melt
like lemon drops, ~</i>

77
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:48,974
<i>~ Away above the chimney tops ~</i>

78
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:54,413
<i>~ That's where you'll find me ~</i>

79
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:04,156
<i>~ Somewhere, over
the rainbow... ~</i>

80
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,093
<i>~ ...bluebirds fly ~</i>

81
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:15,334
<i>~ Birds fly over the rainbow ~</i>

82
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:21,673
<i>~ Why then, oh, why can't I? ~</i>

83
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:39,658
<i>~ If happy little
bluebirds fly... ~</i>

84
00:07:40,058 --> 00:07:42,728
<i>~ ...beyond the rainbow ~</i>

85
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:48,400
<i>~ Why, oh, why can't I? ~</i>

86
00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:15,661
Mr. Gale.

87
00:08:15,827 --> 00:08:17,496
Howdy, Miss Gulch.

88
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:21,433
I want to see you and your
wife right away about Dorothy.

89
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,068
What has Dorothy done?

90
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:26,338
What's she done? I'm all but
lame from the bite on my leg!

91
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,907
-You mean, she bit you?
-No, her dog!

92
00:08:30,475 --> 00:08:32,444
She bit her dog, eh?

93
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,279
No!

94
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:37,049
That dog's a menace.

95
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:39,785
I'll take him to the Sheriff
and make sure he's destroyed.

96
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:41,620
Destroyed? Toto?

97
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,022
Oh, you can't! You mustn't!

98
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:47,993
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!
You won't let her, will you?

99
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:50,629
Of course, we
won't. Will we, Em?

100
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,365
Please, Aunt Em!
Toto didn't mean to.

101
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,868
He didn't know he was doing anything
wrong. I ought to be punished.

102
00:08:56,935 --> 00:09:00,072
I let him go in her garden. You
can send me to bed without supper.

103
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:03,242
Hand over the dog, or I'll bring
a damage suit and take your farm!

104
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:05,711
There's a law protecting
folks from dogs that bite!

105
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:07,412
What if she keeps him tied up?

106
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:09,715
He's really gentle, with
gentle people, that is.

107
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:14,386
Well, that's for the Sheriff to decide.
Here's his order allowing me to take him.

108
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,189
Unless you want to
go against the law.

109
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:20,459
Yes...

110
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:24,229
We can't go against the law. I'm
afraid poor Toto will have to go.

111
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:25,797
Now you're seeing reason.

112
00:09:25,864 --> 00:09:29,101
Here's what I'm taking him in,
so he can't attack me again.

113
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:31,303
No, no! I won't
let you take him!

114
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,605
You go away! I'll
bite you myself!

115
00:09:33,672 --> 00:09:34,773
Dorothy!

116
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,475
You wicked old witch!

117
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,977
Uncle Henry, Auntie Em,
don't let them take Toto!

118
00:09:39,044 --> 00:09:41,680
Don't let her take
him, please! Stop her.

119
00:09:41,813 --> 00:09:44,750
-Put him in the basket, Henry.
-The idea!

120
00:09:44,816 --> 00:09:46,285
Don't, Uncle Henry.

121
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:49,454
Oh, Toto!

122
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:03,235
Almira Gulch, just because
you own half the county...

123
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:06,104
...doesn't mean you have the
power to run the rest of us!

124
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:09,408
For 23 years I've been dying to
tell you what I thought of you!

125
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,946
Well, being a Christian
woman, I can't say it!

126
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:42,941
Toto, darling! Oh,
I've got you back!

127
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,610
You came back!

128
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,246
Oh, I'm so glad!

129
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:54,186
They'll be coming back
for you in a minute.

130
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:58,523
We've got to get away!
We've got to run away!

131
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,529
Well, well, well!
Houseguests, huh?

132
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:39,531
And who might you be?

133
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:41,767
No, no. Now, don't tell me.

134
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:44,469
Let's see. You're...

135
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,839
You're travelling in
disguise. No, that's not right.

136
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:52,211
You're going on a
visit. No, I'm wrong.

137
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:55,948
You're running away.

138
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:57,382
How did you guess?

139
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:00,452
Professor Marvel never
guesses. He knows!

140
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,387
Why are you running away?

141
00:12:02,454 --> 00:12:04,056
No, no. Don't tell me.

142
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:08,126
They don't understand you at
home. They don't appreciate you.

143
00:12:08,193 --> 00:12:12,331
You want to see other lands, big
cities, big mountains, big oceans.

144
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:15,234
It's just like you could
read what was inside of me.

145
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:19,671
Toto, that's not polite!
We haven't been asked yet.

146
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,140
He's perfectly welcome.

147
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,910
As one dog to another, huh?

148
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,779
Now, let's see. Where were we?

149
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,050
Please. Why can't we go with you and
see all the crowned heads of Europe?

150
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:34,386
Do you know any?
You mean, the thing.

151
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:39,725
I never do anything without
consulting my crystal first.

152
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:43,962
Let's go inside here. Just
come along. I'll show you.

153
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:48,166
That's right. Here, sit
right down here. That's it.

154
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:54,039
This is the same genuine,
magic, authentic crystal...

155
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:58,977
...used by the priests of Isis and Osiris
in the days of the pharaohs of Egypt...

156
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:04,182
...in which Cleopatra first saw the approach
of Julius Caesar and Mark Anthony and...

157
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,451
...and so on and so on.

158
00:13:07,886 --> 00:13:10,489
You'd better close
your eyes, my child...

159
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:15,227
...for a moment, in order to be
better in tune with the infinite.

160
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,398
We can't do these
things without...

161
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:22,067
...reaching out
into the infinite.

162
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:27,272
That's all right. Now, you can open
them. We'll gaze into the crystal.

163
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,276
What's this I see?

164
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,445
A house with a picket fence...

165
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,581
...and a barn with
a weathervane...

166
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:38,717
...of a running horse.

167
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:40,719
That's our farm!

168
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,388
Yes. There's a woman.

169
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,758
She's wearing a
polka-dot dress.

170
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:49,127
Her face is careworn.

171
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,829
That's Aunt Em.

172
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,864
Yes. Her name is Emily.

173
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,300
That's right. What's she doing?

174
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:57,736
Well, I can't quite see.

175
00:13:58,303 --> 00:13:59,771
Why, she's crying!

176
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:04,009
Someone has hurt her. Someone
has just about broken her heart.

177
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:05,711
Me?

178
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:09,081
Well, it's someone
she loves very much...

179
00:14:09,147 --> 00:14:13,352
...someone she's been very kind to,
someone she's taken care of in sickness.

180
00:14:14,152 --> 00:14:18,323
I had the measles once and she
stayed right by me every minute.

181
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,260
What's she doing now?

182
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,062
What's this?

183
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,932
Why, she's putting
her hand on her heart!

184
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,635
She's dropping down on the bed!

185
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:30,769
Oh, no!

186
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:33,705
Well, that's all. The
crystal's gone dark.

187
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,376
You don't suppose she could
really be sick, do you?

188
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,311
I've got to go home right away!

189
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,647
I thought you were
going along with me!

190
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:44,850
No, I have to get to her
right away! Come on, Toto!

191
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,285
Come on! Come on!

192
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,323
Goodbye, Professor
Marvel, and thanks a lot!

193
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:57,629
Better get under cover, Sylvester!
There's a storm blowing, a whopper...

194
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,432
...to speak in the
vernacular of the peasantry!

195
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,802
Poor little kid. I hope
she gets home all right.

196
00:15:12,377 --> 00:15:16,815
Hurry up and get them horses loose!
Where's Hickory? Hickory! Hickory!

197
00:15:17,482 --> 00:15:19,284
Doggone it! Hickory!

198
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,888
It's a twister! It's a twister!

199
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,530
Dorothy!

200
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,203
Dorothy!

201
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:51,550
Come on, everybody
in the storm cellar!

202
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:03,896
Henry! I can't find Dorothy!
She's somewhere out in the storm!

203
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,230
Dorothy!

204
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:34,826
Auntie Em!

205
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,129
Auntie Em!

206
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,832
Auntie Em!

207
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,144
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!

208
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,355
Auntie Em!

209
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,059
We must be up
inside the cyclone!

210
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,431
Miss Gulch!

211
00:20:45,655 --> 00:20:49,625
Toto, I have a feeling
we're not in Kansas anymore.

212
00:21:00,736 --> 00:21:02,872
We must be over the rainbow!

213
00:21:33,102 --> 00:21:35,571
Now, I know we're not in Kansas.

214
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:41,143
Are you a good
witch or a bad witch?

215
00:21:42,912 --> 00:21:43,913
Who, me?

216
00:21:44,914 --> 00:21:48,417
I'm not a witch at all. I'm
Dorothy Gale, from Kansas.

217
00:21:49,752 --> 00:21:51,420
Well, is that the witch?

218
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:52,555
Who, Toto?

219
00:21:52,622 --> 00:21:54,056
Toto's my dog.

220
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,025
Well, I'm a little muddled.

221
00:21:56,092 --> 00:21:59,595
The Munchkins called me because a
new witch has just dropped a house...

222
00:21:59,662 --> 00:22:03,899
...on the Wicked Witch of the East. And
there's the house, and here you are...

223
00:22:03,966 --> 00:22:07,403
...and that's all that's left
of the Wicked Witch of the East.

224
00:22:08,271 --> 00:22:10,206
What the Munchkins
want to know is...

225
00:22:10,273 --> 00:22:12,608
...are you a good
witch or a bad witch?

226
00:22:13,376 --> 00:22:16,145
But, I've already told
you, I'm not a witch at all.

227
00:22:16,212 --> 00:22:17,947
Witches are old and ugly.

228
00:22:20,616 --> 00:22:21,617
What was that?

229
00:22:21,684 --> 00:22:25,288
The Munchkins. They're
laughing because I am a witch.

230
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:27,890
I'm Glinda, the
Witch of the North.

231
00:22:27,957 --> 00:22:29,125
You are?

232
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:31,594
I beg your pardon!

233
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:34,664
But I've never heard of
a beautiful witch before.

234
00:22:35,097 --> 00:22:37,099
Only bad witches are ugly.

235
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:42,204
The Munchkins are happy. You freed
them from the Wicked Witch of the East.

236
00:22:42,271 --> 00:22:44,774
But, if you please,
what are Munchkins?

237
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:48,344
The little people who live in
this land. It's Munchkin Land...

238
00:22:48,411 --> 00:22:51,013
...and you are their
national heroine, my dear.

239
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,483
It's all right, you may
all come out and thank her.

240
00:22:55,217 --> 00:22:59,221
<i>~ Come out, come out
wherever you are ~</i>

241
00:22:59,655 --> 00:23:04,493
<i>~ And meet the young lady
who fell from a star ~</i>

242
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:12,768
<i>~ She fell from the
sky, she fell very far ~</i>

243
00:23:13,102 --> 00:23:17,773
<i>~ And Kansas, she says, ~
~ is the name of the star ~</i>

244
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:22,011
<i>~ Kansas, she says, is
the name of the star ~</i>

245
00:23:25,915 --> 00:23:30,586
<i>~ She brings you good news,
or haven't you heard? ~</i>

246
00:23:30,753 --> 00:23:35,758
<i>~ When she fell out of Kansas
a miracle occurred ~</i>

247
00:23:39,895 --> 00:23:43,099
<i>~ It really was no miracle
What happened was just this: ~</i>

248
00:23:43,165 --> 00:23:46,469
<i>~ The wind began to switch,
the house to pitch ~</i>

249
00:23:46,602 --> 00:23:49,939
<i>~ And suddenly the hinges
started to unhitch ~</i>

250
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:53,376
<i>~ Just then the Witch,
to satisfy an itch ~</i>

251
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:56,846
<i>~ Went flying on her broomstick
thumbing for a hitch ~</i>

252
00:23:57,046 --> 00:23:59,782
<i>~ And, oh, what
happened then was rich ~</i>

253
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:03,986
<i>~ The house began to pitch, ~
~ the kitchen took a slitch ~</i>

254
00:24:04,186 --> 00:24:07,023
<i>~ It landed on the Wicked Witch
in the middle of a ditch ~</i>

255
00:24:07,089 --> 00:24:11,761
<i>~ Which was not a healthy
situation for the Wicked Witch ~</i>

256
00:24:12,228 --> 00:24:15,698
<i>~ The house began to pitch, ~
~ the kitchen took a slitch ~</i>

257
00:24:15,765 --> 00:24:18,734
<i>~ It landed on the Wicked Witch
in the middle of a ditch ~</i>

258
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:23,472
<i>~ Which was not a healthy
situation for the Wicked Witch ~</i>

259
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:27,877
<i>~ Who began to twitch, and
was reduced to just a stitch ~</i>

260
00:24:27,977 --> 00:24:32,315
<i>~ Of what was once
the Wicked Witch ~</i>

261
00:24:37,687 --> 00:24:40,289
<i>~ We thank you very sweetly ~</i>

262
00:24:40,356 --> 00:24:42,491
<i>~ For doing it so neatly ~</i>

263
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:45,428
<i>~ You've killed
her so completely ~</i>

264
00:24:45,494 --> 00:24:48,431
<i>~ That we thank
you very sweetly ~</i>

265
00:24:49,532 --> 00:24:51,267
<i>~ Let the joyous
news be spread ~</i>

266
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:54,070
<i>~ The Wicked Old Witch
at last is dead! ~</i>

267
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,610
<i>~ Ding-dong the Witch is
dead Which old witch? ~</i>

268
00:25:00,676 --> 00:25:04,313
<i>~ The Wicked Witch! Ding-dong
the Wicked Witch is dead ~</i>

269
00:25:05,581 --> 00:25:09,385
<i>~ Wake up, you sleepyhead
Rub your eyes, get out of bed ~</i>

270
00:25:09,452 --> 00:25:11,754
<i>~ Wake up, the
Wicked Witch is dead ~</i>

271
00:25:13,155 --> 00:25:16,759
<i>~ She's gone where the goblins
go Below, below, below ~</i>

272
00:25:16,826 --> 00:25:20,796
<i>~ Yo-ho, let's open up and sing
 and ring the bells out ~</i>

273
00:25:20,963 --> 00:25:24,533
<i>~ Ding-dong the merry-oh, ~
~ sing it high, sing it low ~</i>

274
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,571
<i>~ Let them know the
Wicked Witch is dead ~</i>

275
00:25:48,624 --> 00:25:51,627
<i>~ As Mayor of the
Munchkin City ~</i>

276

<i>~ In the county
of the Land of Oz ~</i>

277
00:25:55,731 --> 00:25:58,935
<i>~ I welcome you most regally ~</i>

278
00:25:59,302 --> 00:26:02,672
<i>~ But we've got to
verify it legally ~</i>

279
00:26:02,805 --> 00:26:04,440
<i>~ -To see ~
~ -To see ~</i>

281
00:26:06,142 --> 00:26:08,110
<i>~ Is morally, ethically ~</i>

282

<i>~ Undeniably and
reliably dead. ~</i>

285
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:26,462
<i>~ As Coroner I must aver ~</i>

286
00:26:26,596 --> 00:26:29,498
<i>~ I thoroughly examined her ~</i>

287
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:32,501
<i>~ And she's not
only merely dead ~</i>

288
00:26:32,602 --> 00:26:35,738
<i>~ She's really most
sincerely dead ~</i>

289
00:26:38,507 --> 00:26:42,044
<i>~ Then this is a day of independence
 for all the Munchkins... ~</i>

290
00:26:42,111 --> 00:26:43,546
<i>~ ...and their descendants ~</i>

317
00:29:18,434 --> 00:29:20,303
I thought you said she was dead.

318
00:29:20,369 --> 00:29:22,872
That was her sister, the
Wicked Witch of the East.

319
00:29:22,939 --> 00:29:26,575
This is the Wicked Witch of the West.
She's worse than the other one was.

320
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:30,513
Who killed my sister? Who
killed the Witch of the East?

321
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,381
Was it you?

322
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:36,352
No, no. It was an accident.
I didn't mean to kill anybody.

323
00:29:36,686 --> 00:29:39,789
Well, my little pretty, I
can cause accidents, too!

324
00:29:40,056 --> 00:29:41,958
Aren't you forgetting
the ruby slippers?

325
00:29:42,024 --> 00:29:43,626
The slippers, yes!

326
00:29:44,927 --> 00:29:46,329
The slippers!

327
00:29:53,803 --> 00:29:54,870
They're gone!

328
00:29:54,937 --> 00:29:57,306
The ruby slippers! What
have you done with them?

329
00:29:57,373 --> 00:29:59,275
Give them back to me or I'll-

330
00:29:59,342 --> 00:30:01,143
It's too late! There they are...

331
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,912
...and there they'll stay!

332
00:30:06,882 --> 00:30:08,584
Give me back my slippers!

333
00:30:08,651 --> 00:30:10,519
I'm the only one who
knows how to use them.

334
00:30:10,586 --> 00:30:13,122
They're of no use to
you. Give them back to me.

335
00:30:13,356 --> 00:30:15,658
-Give them back!
-Keep tight inside of them.

336
00:30:15,725 --> 00:30:19,095
Their magic must be very powerful,
or she wouldn't want them so badly.

337
00:30:19,161 --> 00:30:22,198
You stay out of this, Glinda,
or I'll fix you as well!

338
00:30:22,365 --> 00:30:24,433
Rubbish! You have no power here.

339
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,570
Begone, before somebody
drops a house on you, too!

340
00:30:27,703 --> 00:30:30,373
Very well, I'll bide my time.

341
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,042
And as for you, my fine lady...

342
00:30:33,142 --> 00:30:36,045
...it's true I can't attend to
you here and now as I'd like...

343
00:30:36,112 --> 00:30:38,381
...but just try to
stay out of my way.

344
00:30:38,447 --> 00:30:39,582
Just try!

345
00:30:39,949 --> 00:30:43,319
I'll get you, my pretty,
and your little dog, too!

346
00:30:55,064 --> 00:30:57,667
It's all right. You
can get up. She's gone.

347
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:00,803
It's all right.
You can all get up.

348
00:31:02,104 --> 00:31:03,873
What a smell of sulphur!

349
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:07,143
I'm afraid you've made a bad enemy
of the Wicked Witch of the West.

350
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:11,514
The sooner you get out of Oz altogether,
the safer you'll sleep, my dear.

351
00:31:11,614 --> 00:31:14,717
I'd give anything to get
out of Oz altogether, but...

352
00:31:14,951 --> 00:31:18,988
...which is the way back to
Kansas? I can't go the way I came.

353
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:22,091
No, that's true. The only
person who might know...

354
00:31:22,325 --> 00:31:25,628
...would be the great and
wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!

355
00:31:26,062 --> 00:31:29,131
The Wizard of Oz? Is
he good or is he wicked?

356
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:33,302
Very good, but very mysterious.
He lives in the Emerald City...

357
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:37,640
...and that's a long journey from here.
Did you bring your broomstick with you?

358
00:31:38,107 --> 00:31:39,809
No, I'm afraid I didn't.

359
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:41,711
Well, then, you'll have to walk.

360
00:31:41,777 --> 00:31:45,314
The Munchkins will see you safely
to the border of Munchkin Land.

361
00:31:45,414 --> 00:31:49,852
And remember, never let those ruby
slippers off your feet for a moment...

362
00:31:50,052 --> 00:31:53,689
...or you will be at the mercy
of the Wicked Witch of the West.

363
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:57,126
But how do I start
for Emerald City?

364
00:31:57,193 --> 00:31:59,462
It's always best to
start at the beginning...

365
00:31:59,528 --> 00:32:02,398
...and all you do is follow
the Yellow Brick Road.

366
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:14,477
But, what happens if I-

367
00:32:14,543 --> 00:32:17,079
Just follow the
Yellow Brick Road.

368
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,849
Goodbye. Goodbye.

369
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:34,830
My!

370
00:32:35,564 --> 00:32:37,900
People come and
go so quickly here!

371
00:32:40,803 --> 00:32:42,738
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

372
00:32:45,374 --> 00:32:47,276
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

373
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:50,680
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

374
00:32:52,048 --> 00:32:53,950
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

375
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,252
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

376
00:32:56,352 --> 00:32:58,054
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

377

387
00:33:55,555 --> 00:33:57,424
Follow the Yellow...

388
00:33:58,358 --> 00:33:59,693
Now which way do we go?

389
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,629
Pardon me. That way
is a very nice way.

390
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:07,567
Who said that?

391
00:34:11,238 --> 00:34:13,940
Don't be silly, Toto.
Scarecrows don't talk.

392
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,610
It's pleasant
down that way, too.

393
00:34:18,211 --> 00:34:19,479
That's funny.

394
00:34:20,447 --> 00:34:22,215
Wasn't he pointing
the other way?

395
00:34:22,282 --> 00:34:24,651
Of course, people
do go both ways.

396
00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:31,358
You did say
something, didn't you?

397
00:34:36,463 --> 00:34:39,633
Are you doing that on purpose,
or can't you make up your mind?

398
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:42,736
That's the trouble. I
can't make up my mind.

399
00:34:43,003 --> 00:34:45,906
I haven't got a
brain, only straw.

400
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,509
How can you talk if
you haven't got a brain?

401
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:51,278
I don't know.

402
00:34:51,778 --> 00:34:55,449
But some people without brains do
an awful lot of talking, don't they?

403
00:34:55,515 --> 00:34:57,551
Yes, I guess you're right.

404
00:34:58,852 --> 00:35:02,255
Well, we haven't really
met properly, have we?

405
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,524
Why, no!

406
00:35:04,691 --> 00:35:05,959
How do you do?

407
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:07,360
How do you do?

408
00:35:07,427 --> 00:35:08,662
Very well, thank you.

409
00:35:08,729 --> 00:35:10,597
I'm not feeling at all well.

410
00:35:11,131 --> 00:35:16,069
It's very tedious being stuck up here
all day long with a pole up your back.

411
00:35:16,203 --> 00:35:20,207
That must be terribly
uncomfortable. Can't you get down?

412
00:35:20,273 --> 00:35:23,143
Down? No, you see,
I'm... Well, I'm...

413
00:35:23,276 --> 00:35:25,445
Well, here, let me help you.

414
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:28,381
That's very kind
of you, very kind.

415
00:35:30,317 --> 00:35:31,985
I don't quite see how...

416
00:35:32,385 --> 00:35:35,255
Of course, I'm not bright
about doing things...

417
00:35:35,789 --> 00:35:40,193
...but if you'll just bend the nail down
in the back, maybe I'll slip off and...

418
00:35:40,394 --> 00:35:41,428
Oh, yes.

419
00:35:44,164 --> 00:35:46,066
There goes some of me again!

420
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:47,200
Does it hurt you?

421
00:35:47,267 --> 00:35:51,138
Oh, no. I just keep picking it
up and putting it back in again.

422
00:35:51,438 --> 00:35:53,507
My! It's good to be free!

423
00:35:55,742 --> 00:35:57,110
Did I scare you?

424
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,247
No, no. I just thought
you hurt yourself.

425
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,948
But I didn't scare you?

426
00:36:02,149 --> 00:36:03,550
No, of course not.

427
00:36:03,884 --> 00:36:05,285
I didn't think so.

428
00:36:11,858 --> 00:36:14,528
You see, I can't
even scare a crow.

429
00:36:15,028 --> 00:36:19,166
They come from miles around just to
eat in my field and laugh in my face.

430
00:36:19,232 --> 00:36:22,536
I'm a failure because
I haven't got a brain!

431
00:36:23,937 --> 00:36:26,206
What would you do with
a brain if you had one?

432
00:36:26,273 --> 00:36:29,076
Do? Why, if I had
a brain, I could...

433
00:36:29,509 --> 00:36:33,280
<i>~ I could wile away the hours ~
~ Conferrin' with the flowers ~</i>

434
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:35,715
<i>~ Consultin' with the rain ~</i>

435

442

<i>~ The ocean's near the shore ~</i>

443
00:37:07,514 --> 00:37:10,584
<i>~ I could think of things
 I never thunk before ~</i>

444
00:37:10,751 --> 00:37:13,887

Wonderful!

00:37:33,473 --> 00:37:38,111
If our scarecrow back in Kansas could
do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!

451
00:37:38,178 --> 00:37:39,613
-They would?
-Yes.

452
00:37:39,746 --> 00:37:40,814
Where's Kansas?

453
00:37:40,881 --> 00:37:42,215
That's where I live.

454
00:37:42,282 --> 00:37:45,419
I want to get back there so
badly I'm going to Emerald City...

455
00:37:45,485 --> 00:37:47,554
...to get the Wizard
of Oz to help me.

456
00:37:47,621 --> 00:37:49,856
You're going to see a wizard?

457
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:53,960
Do you think if I went with you this
wizard would give me some brains?

458
00:37:54,027 --> 00:37:55,495
I couldn't say.

459
00:37:56,063 --> 00:37:59,599
But even if he didn't, you'd be
no worse off than you are now.

460
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,568
Yes, that's true.

461
00:38:01,635 --> 00:38:05,439
You'd better not. I've got a witch mad
at me and you might get into trouble.

462
00:38:05,505 --> 00:38:06,640
Witch?

463
00:38:06,706 --> 00:38:09,843
I'm not afraid of a witch.
I'm not afraid of anything!

464
00:38:12,112 --> 00:38:13,980
Except a lighted match.

465
00:38:14,081 --> 00:38:15,549
I don't blame you for that.

466
00:38:15,615 --> 00:38:19,720
But I'd face a whole box full of them
for the chance of getting some brains.

467
00:38:21,688 --> 00:38:24,424
I won't be any trouble
because I don't eat a thing.

468
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:27,794
I won't try to manage
things because I can't think.

469
00:38:28,562 --> 00:38:30,297
Won't you take me with you?

470
00:38:30,964 --> 00:38:32,332
Of course, I will!

471
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,502
Hooray! We're off
to see a wizard!

472
00:38:35,802 --> 00:38:37,971
Well, you're not
starting out very well.

473
00:38:38,038 --> 00:38:40,340
I'll try! Really, I will.

474
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:42,509
-To Oz?
-To Oz!

475
00:38:42,609 --> 00:38:46,780
<i>~ We're off to see the Wizard
 The Wonderful Wizard of Oz ~</i>

476

 If ever a Wiz there was ~</i>

477
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:54,221

 The Wizard of Oz is one because ~</i>

478
00:38:54,287 --> 00:38:57,324
<i>~ Because, because, because,
 because, because ~</i>

479
00:38:57,824 --> 00:39:00,460

481
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,715
Apples!

482
00:39:23,183 --> 00:39:24,418
Oh, look!

483
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,262
What do you think you're doing?

484
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:40,267
We've been walking a long
ways and I was hungry and...

485
00:39:41,334 --> 00:39:42,836
Did you say something?

486
00:39:42,903 --> 00:39:45,005
-She was hungry!
-She was hungry!

487
00:39:45,072 --> 00:39:49,176
How would you like to have someone come
along and pick something off of you?

488
00:39:49,409 --> 00:39:52,879
Oh, dear! I keep forgetting
I'm not in Kansas.

489
00:39:53,847 --> 00:39:57,551
Come along, Dorothy, you
don't want any of those apples.

490
00:39:57,617 --> 00:39:59,953
Are you hinting my apples
aren't what they should be?

491
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:03,757
Oh, no! It's just that she
doesn't like little green worms!

492
00:40:04,124 --> 00:40:04,958
You!

493
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,199
I'll show you how to get apples.

494
00:40:18,772 --> 00:40:21,908
Hooray! I guess that
did it! Help yourself.

495
00:40:47,067 --> 00:40:48,602
Why, it's a man!

496
00:40:50,437 --> 00:40:52,305
A man made out of tin!

497
00:40:52,806 --> 00:40:54,174
-What?
-Yes.

498
00:40:56,276 --> 00:40:57,411
Look!

499
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:00,313
Oilcan.

500
00:41:01,515 --> 00:41:03,350
Did you say something?

501
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:04,551
Oilcan.

502
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:07,254
He said, "Oilcan."

503
00:41:07,487 --> 00:41:08,889
"Oilcan" what?

504
00:41:09,122 --> 00:41:10,123
Oilcan?

505
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,694
Here it is!

506
00:41:15,462 --> 00:41:18,298
-Where do you want to be oiled first?
-My mouth.

507
00:41:18,398 --> 00:41:20,400
-My mouth.
-He said his mouth.

508
00:41:24,538 --> 00:41:26,039
The other side.

509
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,885
My goodness, I can talk again!

510
00:41:39,886 --> 00:41:42,355
Oil my arms, please,
oil my elbows.

511
00:41:43,824 --> 00:41:44,825
Here.

512
00:41:48,628 --> 00:41:49,763
Did that hurt?

513
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:54,067
No, it feels wonderful. I've
held that axe up for ages.

514
00:41:54,901 --> 00:41:55,936
Goodness!

515
00:41:56,203 --> 00:41:58,405
How did you ever get like this?

516
00:42:00,841 --> 00:42:03,944
About a year ago, I was
chopping that tree...

517
00:42:04,044 --> 00:42:06,279
...when suddenly
it began to rain.

518
00:42:06,413 --> 00:42:09,950
And right in the middle
of a chop, I rusted solid.

519
00:42:10,884 --> 00:42:12,819
I've been that way ever since.

520
00:42:15,889 --> 00:42:17,924
Well, you're perfect now.

521
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:19,726
My neck. My neck.

522
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,328
Perfect?

523
00:42:21,795 --> 00:42:24,364
Bang on my chest if
you think I'm perfect.

524
00:42:24,798 --> 00:42:26,433
Go ahead, bang on it.

525
00:42:29,069 --> 00:42:31,104
Beautiful! What an echo!

526
00:42:31,938 --> 00:42:33,240
It's empty.

527
00:42:34,441 --> 00:42:37,010
The tinsmith forgot
to give me a heart.

528
00:42:38,045 --> 00:42:39,212
No heart?

529
00:42:40,113 --> 00:42:41,114
No heart.

530
00:42:42,049 --> 00:42:43,316
All hollow.

531
00:42:47,921 --> 00:42:50,257
<i>~ When a man's an empty kettle ~</i>

538

<i>~ ...how sweet! ~</i>

547
00:43:42,743 --> 00:43:47,247

 jealousy, devotion ~</i>

548

00:45:25,011 --> 00:45:27,914
-Are you all right?
-I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.

553
00:45:27,981 --> 00:45:29,149
Oh, dear!

554
00:45:30,183 --> 00:45:31,852
That was wonderful!

555
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:33,787
You know...

556
00:45:34,721 --> 00:45:38,091
We were wondering why you couldn't
come with us to the Emerald City...

557
00:45:38,158 --> 00:45:39,993
...to ask the Wizard
of Oz for a heart?

558
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:43,163
Suppose the Wizard wouldn't
give me one when we got there?

559
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:45,766
But he will! He must!

560
00:45:46,533 --> 00:45:49,035
We've come such a
long way already.

561
00:45:55,142 --> 00:45:56,810
You call that long?

562
00:45:56,877 --> 00:45:58,779
Why, you've just begun!

563
00:45:59,046 --> 00:46:02,916
Helping the little lady along,
are you, my fine gentlemen?

564
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:05,085
Well, stay away from her...

565
00:46:05,285 --> 00:46:07,387
...or I'll stuff
a mattress with you!

566
00:46:08,789 --> 00:46:09,923
And you!

567
00:46:10,123 --> 00:46:12,592
I'll use you for a beehive!

568
00:46:12,826 --> 00:46:15,462
Here, Scarecrow!
Want to play ball?

569
00:46:19,533 --> 00:46:22,836
Lookout! I'm
burning! I'm burning!

570
00:46:35,649 --> 00:46:39,319
I'm not afraid of her. I'll see
you get safely to the Wizard now...

571
00:46:39,386 --> 00:46:43,490
...whether I get a brain or not!
"Stuff a mattress with me," hah!

572
00:46:44,524 --> 00:46:47,728
I'll see you reach the Wizard,
whether I get a heart or not.

573
00:46:47,794 --> 00:46:51,832
"Beehive," bah! Let her try
and make a beehive out of me!

574
00:46:55,335 --> 00:46:58,038
You're the best friends
anybody ever had.

575
00:46:58,472 --> 00:47:02,342
And it's funny, but I feel as
if I've known you all the time.

576
00:47:03,009 --> 00:47:04,745
But I couldn't have, could I?

577
00:47:04,811 --> 00:47:08,882
I don't see how. You weren't around
when I was stuffed and sewn together...

578
00:47:08,949 --> 00:47:09,850
...were you?

579
00:47:09,916 --> 00:47:13,587
And I was standing over there
rusting for the longest time.

580
00:47:13,754 --> 00:47:18,258
Still, I wish I could remember. But
I guess it doesn't matter anyway.

581
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,261
We know each other
now, don't we?

582
00:47:21,328 --> 00:47:23,363
-That's right.
-We do.

583
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:25,165
-To Oz?
-To Oz!

590

I don't like this forest!

591
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:15,476
It's dark and creepy!

592
00:48:17,044 --> 00:48:21,615
Of course, I don't know, but I think
it'll get darker before it gets lighter.

593
00:48:23,918 --> 00:48:26,620
Do you suppose we'll
meet any wild animals?

594
00:48:26,687 --> 00:48:27,855
We might.

595
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:31,458
Animals that eat straw?

596
00:48:31,959 --> 00:48:35,196
Some, but mostly lions
and tigers and bears.

597
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,130
Lions!

598
00:48:36,197 --> 00:48:37,064

599

00:49:22,476 --> 00:49:24,078
Which one of you first?

608
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,847
I'll fight you both
together, if you want.

609
00:49:26,914 --> 00:49:29,917
I'll fight you with one
paw tied behind my back!

610
00:49:30,518 --> 00:49:32,419
I'll fight you
standing on one foot!

611
00:49:32,486 --> 00:49:34,622
I'll fight you
with my eyes closed.

612
00:49:36,624 --> 00:49:38,459
Pulling an axe on me, eh?

613
00:49:39,426 --> 00:49:41,629
Sneaking up on me, eh? Why...

614
00:49:44,465 --> 00:49:47,434
-Here, here. Go away and let us alone.
-Scared, huh?

615
00:49:47,801 --> 00:49:49,136
Afraid, huh?

616
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:52,439
How long can you stay
fresh in that can?

617
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:56,744
Come on, get up and fight,
you shivering junkyard!

618
00:49:58,279 --> 00:50:00,915
Put your hands up, you
lopsided bag of hay!

619
00:50:00,981 --> 00:50:02,950
Now, that's getting
personal, Lion.

620
00:50:03,717 --> 00:50:05,886
Yes, get up and
teach him a lesson.

621
00:50:05,953 --> 00:50:08,522
Well, what's wrong
with you teaching him?

622
00:50:08,656 --> 00:50:10,758
Well, I hardly know him.

623
00:50:12,693 --> 00:50:14,428
I'll get you anyway, Pee-Wee.

624
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:26,440
Shame on you!

625
00:50:26,907 --> 00:50:30,277
What did you do that
for? I didn't bite him.

626
00:50:30,544 --> 00:50:32,246
No, but you tried to.

627
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:36,517
It's bad enough picking on a straw man,
but when you pick on poor little dogs...

628
00:50:36,584 --> 00:50:39,253
You didn't have to go
and hit me, did you?

629
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:42,489
Is my nose bleeding?

630
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:44,258
Well, of course not.

631
00:50:46,594 --> 00:50:49,063
My goodness, what a
fuss you're making!

632
00:50:49,196 --> 00:50:53,400
Naturally, when you go around picking
on things weaker than you are...

633
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,636
...you're nothing but
a great, big coward!

634
00:50:55,703 --> 00:50:57,905
You're right, I am a coward!

635
00:50:59,273 --> 00:51:01,242
I haven't any courage at all.

636
00:51:01,775 --> 00:51:03,611
I even scare myself.

637
00:51:05,279 --> 00:51:07,314
Look at the circles
under my eyes.

638
00:51:07,381 --> 00:51:09,216
I haven't slept in weeks.

639
00:51:09,617 --> 00:51:11,685
Why don't you try
counting sheep?

640
00:51:11,785 --> 00:51:14,855
That doesn't do any
good. I'm afraid of them.

641
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,658
That's too bad.

642
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:21,562
Don't you think the
Wizard could help him, too?

643
00:51:21,629 --> 00:51:23,097
I don't see why not.

644
00:51:23,564 --> 00:51:25,366
Why don't you
come along with us?

645
00:51:25,432 --> 00:51:28,302
We're on our way to see the
Wizard now. To get him a heart.

646
00:51:28,369 --> 00:51:29,503
And him a brain.

647
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:31,639
I'm sure he could
give you some courage.

648
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:36,744
Wouldn't you feel degraded to be seen
in the company of a cowardly lion?

649
00:51:37,444 --> 00:51:38,479
I would.

650
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:41,048
No, of course not!

651
00:51:41,982 --> 00:51:44,685
Gee, that's awfully nice of you.

652
00:51:45,819 --> 00:51:48,756
My life has been
simply unbearable.

653
00:51:49,623 --> 00:51:53,494
Well, it's all right now.
The Wizard'll fix everything.

654
00:51:54,261 --> 00:51:56,430
It's been in me so long...

655
00:51:57,198 --> 00:51:59,600
...I just gotta
tell you how I feel.

656
00:52:00,267 --> 00:52:01,702
Well, come on!

657
00:52:02,236 --> 00:52:06,340
<i>~ Yeah, it's sad, believe me, missy
 When you're born to be a sissy ~</i>

658
00:52:06,674 --> 00:52:08,642
<i>~ Without the vim and verve ~</i>

659
00:52:10,244 --> 00:52:12,179
<i>~ But I could show my prowess ~</i>

660
00:52:12,279 --> 00:52:14,281
<i>~ Be a lion not a mouse ~</i>

661
00:52:14,682 --> 00:52:16,684
<i>~ If I only had the nerve ~</i>

662
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:20,221
<i>~ I'm afraid
there's no denyin' ~</i>

663
00:52:20,487 --> 00:52:22,490
<i>~ I'm just a dandelion ~</i>

664
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,558
<i>~ A fate I don't deserve ~</i>

665
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,062
<i>~ I'd be brave as a blizzard ~</i>

666
00:52:28,128 --> 00:52:30,130
<i>~ I'd be gentle as a lizard ~</i>

667
00:52:30,197 --> 00:52:32,199
<i>~ I'd be clever as a gizzard ~</i>

668
00:52:32,299 --> 00:52:35,302
<i>~ If the Wizard is a
wizard who will serve ~</i>

669
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:39,373
<i>~ Then I'm sure to get a brain ~</i>

670
00:52:39,673 --> 00:52:40,674
<i>~ A heart ~</i>

671
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:41,742
<i>~ A home ~</i>

672
00:52:41,809 --> 00:52:42,943
<i>~ The nerve. ~</i>

673
00:52:45,312 --> 00:52:48,916
<i>~ We're off to see the Wizard
 The Wonderful Wizard of Oz ~</i>

674
00:52:48,983 --> 00:52:52,386
<i>~ We hear he is a whiz of a Wiz
 If ever a Wiz there was ~</i>

675
00:52:52,453 --> 00:52:55,823
<i>~ If ever, oh ever, a Wiz there was
 The Wizard of Oz is one because ~</i>

676
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:58,926
<i>~ Because, because, because,
 because, because ~</i>

677
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,829
<i>~ Because of the
wonderful things he does ~</i>

678
00:53:02,863 --> 00:53:06,600
<i>~ We're off to see the Wizard
 The Wonderful Wizard of Oz ~</i>

679
00:53:15,643 --> 00:53:18,045
So, you won't take warning, eh?

680
00:53:18,312 --> 00:53:19,880
All the worse for you!

681
00:53:20,347 --> 00:53:22,983
I'll take care of you
now instead of later!

682
00:53:26,887 --> 00:53:31,225
When I gain those ruby slippers,
my power will be the greatest in Oz!

683
00:53:33,694 --> 00:53:35,663
And now, my beauties...

684
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:38,866
...something with
poison in it, I think.

685
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,101
With poison in it...

686
00:53:41,702 --> 00:53:43,637
...but attractive to the eye...

687
00:53:43,704 --> 00:53:46,106
...and soothing to the smell!

688
00:53:48,609 --> 00:53:49,610
Poppies!

689
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:51,812
Poppies!

690
00:53:53,214 --> 00:53:55,482
Poppies will put them to sleep.

691
00:53:56,884 --> 00:53:58,018
Sleep.

692
00:53:59,053 --> 00:54:01,555
Now they'll sleep.

693
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,320
There's Emerald City!

694
00:54:33,487 --> 00:54:36,223
We're almost there
at last! At last!

695
00:54:37,124 --> 00:54:40,761
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Just like I knew it would be.

696
00:54:41,462 --> 00:54:44,765
He really must be a wonderful
wizard to live in a city like that!

697
00:54:44,832 --> 00:54:46,634
Come on. What are
we waiting for?

698
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,068
Nothing! Let's hurry!

699
00:54:48,135 --> 00:54:49,537
Yes, let's run!

700
00:54:54,341 --> 00:54:55,709
Come on, come on!

701
00:54:55,776 --> 00:54:57,044
Hurry! Hurry!

702
00:55:01,182 --> 00:55:02,116
Look!

703
00:55:04,251 --> 00:55:05,386
Come on!

704
00:55:05,786 --> 00:55:06,787
The city!

705
00:55:06,854 --> 00:55:09,190
It's wonderful!
The Emerald City!

706
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:16,263
What's happening?

707
00:55:16,597 --> 00:55:17,965
What is it?

708
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:20,100
I can't run anymore.

709
00:55:20,968 --> 00:55:21,969
I'm so sleepy.

710
00:55:22,036 --> 00:55:24,205
Give us your hands and
we'll pull you along.

711
00:55:24,271 --> 00:55:25,406
No, please.

712
00:55:25,639 --> 00:55:27,842
I have to rest
for just a minute.

713
00:55:28,008 --> 00:55:28,943
Toto...

714
00:55:29,009 --> 00:55:30,211
Where's Toto?

715
00:55:30,644 --> 00:55:32,947
You can't rest now.
We're nearly there.

716
00:55:35,316 --> 00:55:37,885
Don't cry, you'll
rust yourself again!

717
00:55:37,952 --> 00:55:41,255
Come to think of it, forty
winks wouldn't be bad.

718
00:55:42,122 --> 00:55:43,791
Don't you start it, too!

719
00:55:43,891 --> 00:55:46,494
No! We ought to try
and carry Dorothy!

720
00:55:46,694 --> 00:55:48,796
I don't think I could,
but we could try.

721
00:55:48,863 --> 00:55:50,030
-Let's.
-Yes.

722
00:55:51,332 --> 00:55:53,400
Now look at him!
This is terrible!

723
00:55:53,467 --> 00:55:55,102
Here, Tin Man, help me.

724
00:55:57,471 --> 00:56:00,407
This is terrible! I
can't budge her an inch!

725
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,476
This is a spell, this is!

726
00:56:02,543 --> 00:56:04,912
It's the Wicked
Witch! What'll we do?

727
00:56:05,646 --> 00:56:06,647
Help!

728
00:56:07,147 --> 00:56:08,148
Help!

729
00:56:08,315 --> 00:56:12,520
It's no use screaming at a time like
this. Nobody will hear you! Help!

730
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,722
Help!

731
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:21,095
It's snowing!

732
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:23,864
No, it isn't!

733
00:56:25,366 --> 00:56:26,567
Yes, it is!

734
00:56:28,335 --> 00:56:29,803
Maybe that'll help!

735
00:56:30,938 --> 00:56:32,573
But it couldn't help!

736
00:56:33,541 --> 00:56:36,510
It does help! Dorothy,
you're waking up!

737
00:56:44,084 --> 00:56:46,587
Unusual weather we're
having, ain't it?

738
00:56:47,521 --> 00:56:49,490
Look, he's rusted again!

739
00:56:51,725 --> 00:56:54,461
-Give me the oilcan, quick!
-Here! Oil him.

740
00:56:55,396 --> 00:56:56,697
-He is rusted.
-Here.

741
00:56:56,764 --> 00:56:58,232
Here. Quick!

742
00:57:00,634 --> 00:57:04,171
Curses! Curses! Somebody
always helps that girl!

743
00:57:06,607 --> 00:57:10,611
But shoes or no shoes, I'm still
great enough to conquer her.

744
00:57:10,678 --> 00:57:12,580
And woe to those
who try to stop me!

745
00:57:12,713 --> 00:57:14,815
Come on, let's get out of here.

746
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:17,918
Look, Emerald City is closer
and prettier than ever!

747
00:57:17,985 --> 00:57:20,154
You're out of the dark

748
00:57:47,248 --> 00:57:49,884
To the Emerald City
as fast as lightning!

749
00:57:59,983 --> 00:58:01,833
<i>~ You're out of the woods
 You're out of the dark ~</i>

750
00:58:01,837 --> 00:58:03,735
<i>~ You're out of the night ~</i>

751
00:58:03,991 --> 00:58:05,983
<i>~ Step into the sun,
step into the light ~</i>

752
00:58:05,987 --> 00:58:10,078
<i>~ March up to the gate
 And bid it open ~</i>

753
00:58:10,982 --> 00:58:12,730
<i>~ Open ~</i>

754
00:58:18,087 --> 00:58:19,788
Who rang that bell?

755
00:58:19,888 --> 00:58:20,889
We did!

756
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:22,224
Can't you read?

757
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:24,026
-Read what?
-The notice!

758
00:58:24,593 --> 00:58:25,594
What notice?

759
00:58:25,661 --> 00:58:29,064
It's on the door, as plain
as the nose on my face!

760
00:58:38,774 --> 00:58:41,543
"Bell out of order,
please knock."

761
00:58:44,279 --> 00:58:46,648
Well, that's more like it.

762
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:48,684
Now, state your business.

763
00:58:48,951 --> 00:58:50,686
We want to see the Wizard.

764
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:53,789
The Wizard?

765
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:57,126
But nobody can see the great Oz!

766
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:01,363
Nobody's ever seen the great
Oz! Even I've never seen him!

767
00:59:01,797 --> 00:59:04,199
Well, then, how do
you know there is one?

768
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,868
Because he's...

769
00:59:07,603 --> 00:59:09,371
You're wasting my time!

770
00:59:10,472 --> 00:59:12,074
Please! Please, sir!

771
00:59:12,474 --> 00:59:14,276
I've got to see the Wizard.

772
00:59:14,543 --> 00:59:16,678
The Good Witch of
the North sent me.

773
00:59:16,745 --> 00:59:17,780
Prove it!

774
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,916
She's wearing the ruby
slippers she gave her!

775
00:59:25,254 --> 00:59:26,689
So she is!

776
00:59:26,922 --> 00:59:29,158
Well, bust my buttons!

777
00:59:29,591 --> 00:59:32,161
Why didn't you say
that in the first place?

778
00:59:32,227 --> 00:59:35,464
That's a horse of a
different color! Come on in!

779
00:59:48,243 --> 00:59:51,313
Cabby! Cabby! Just
what you're looking for!

780
00:59:51,513 --> 00:59:53,749
Take you any place
in the city, we does!

781
00:59:53,816 --> 00:59:55,684
Would you take us
to see the Wizard?

782
00:59:55,751 --> 00:59:57,920
The Wizard? The Wizard?

783
01:00:00,456 --> 01:00:01,757
Yes, of course.

784
01:00:01,824 --> 01:00:05,661
But first I'll take you to a little
place where you can tidy up a bit.

785
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:07,429
Thank you so much.

786
01:00:07,763 --> 01:00:11,233
We've been gone such a
long time, and we feel so...

787
01:00:12,735 --> 01:00:17,106
What kind of a horse is that? I've
never seen a horse like that before!

788
01:00:17,206 --> 01:00:21,143
No, and never will again, I fancy.
There's only one of him, and he's it.

789
01:00:21,343 --> 01:00:24,713
He's the Horse of a Different
Color you've heard tell about.

790
01:00:25,414 --> 01:00:27,216
<i>~ Ha, ha, ha ~

<i>~ In the Merry Old Land of Oz ~</i>

825
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:20,029
Who's her? Who's her?

826
01:02:20,662 --> 01:02:23,365
It's the Witch! She's
followed us here!

827
01:02:23,465 --> 01:02:25,401
"Surrender Dorothy."

828
01:02:26,969 --> 01:02:28,771
Dorothy? Who's Dorothy?

829
01:02:28,837 --> 01:02:30,105
The Wizard will explain it!

830
01:02:30,172 --> 01:02:30,839
To the Wizard!

831
01:02:30,906 --> 01:02:32,174
To the Wizard!

832
01:02:32,975 --> 01:02:34,510
Whatever shall we do?

833
01:02:34,576 --> 01:02:37,046
We'd better hurry if we're
going to see the Wizard!

834
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:42,685
Here! Here, here!
Everything is all right.

835
01:02:42,851 --> 01:02:44,486
Stop that now.

836
01:02:45,087 --> 01:02:47,356
It's all right!
Everything is all right!

837
01:02:47,423 --> 01:02:52,327
The great and powerful Oz has
got matters well in hand. I hope.

838
01:02:52,961 --> 01:02:55,030
And so you can all go home!

839
01:02:55,097 --> 01:02:56,965
And there's nothing
to worry about!

840
01:02:57,032 --> 01:02:59,735
Get out of here now,
go on! Go on home and...

841
01:03:00,969 --> 01:03:02,104
Go home.

842
01:03:02,971 --> 01:03:05,541
If you please, we want to
see the Wizard right away.

843
01:03:05,607 --> 01:03:06,675
All four of us.

844
01:03:06,742 --> 01:03:09,378
Orders are: Nobody
can see the great Oz!

845
01:03:09,445 --> 01:03:11,113
Not nobody, not nohow!

846
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,982
But, please. It's
very important.

847
01:03:14,316 --> 01:03:16,618
And I got a permanent
just for the occasion.

848
01:03:16,685 --> 01:03:18,887
Not nobody, not nohow!

849
01:03:19,288 --> 01:03:20,823
But she's Dorothy!

850
01:03:21,457 --> 01:03:23,125
The Witch's Dorothy?

851
01:03:25,294 --> 01:03:27,396
Well, that makes a difference.

852
01:03:28,764 --> 01:03:31,300
Wait here. I'll
announce you at once!

853
01:03:35,971 --> 01:03:38,607
Did you hear that? He'll
announce us at once!

854
01:03:38,707 --> 01:03:42,010
-I've as good as got my brain!
-I can fairly hear my heart beating.

855
01:03:42,077 --> 01:03:46,148
-I'll be home in time for supper!
-In another hour I'll be King of the Forest.

856
01:03:46,382 --> 01:03:48,417
Long live the King!

857
01:03:56,258 --> 01:04:00,529
<i>~ If I were King of the Forest ~</i>

858
01:04:02,164 --> 01:04:06,602
<i>~ Not Queen, not
Duke, not Prince ~</i>

859
01:04:07,936 --> 01:04:11,640
<i>~ My regal robes of the forest ~</i>

860
01:04:12,508 --> 01:04:17,479
<i>~ Would be satin, not
cotton, not chintz. ~</i>

861
01:04:19,014 --> 01:04:22,484
<i>~ I'd command each thing,
be it fish or fowl ~</i>

862
01:04:22,785 --> 01:04:27,790
<i>~ With a woof and a
woof, and a royal growl ~</i>

863
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:33,529
<i>~ As I click my heel
All the trees would kneel ~</i>

864
01:04:33,595 --> 01:04:37,366
<i>~ And the mountains bow
 And the bulls kowtow ~</i>

865
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:44,306
<i>~ And the sparrow
would take wing ~</i>

866
01:04:45,974 --> 01:04:50,645
<i>~ If I... if I were King! ~</i>

867
01:04:53,399 --> 01:04:57,103
<i>~ Each rabbit would
show respect to me ~</i>

868
01:04:57,370 --> 01:05:01,007
<i>~ The chipmunks
genuflect to me ~</i>

869
01:05:01,073 --> 01:05:04,410
<i>~ Though my tail would lash
 I would show compash ~</i>

870
01:05:04,944 --> 01:05:07,947
<i>~ For every underling ~</i>

871
01:05:09,215 --> 01:05:13,886
<i>~ If I... if I were King ~</i>

872
01:05:16,222 --> 01:05:18,991
<i>~ Just King! ~</i>

873
01:05:52,158 --> 01:05:55,828
<i>~ Monarch of all I survey ~</i>

874
01:05:58,264 --> 01:06:02,268
<i>~ Monarch... ~</i>

875
01:06:03,336 --> 01:06:07,340
<i>~ ...of all I survey! ~</i>

876
01:06:10,376 --> 01:06:13,646
Your Majesty, if you were King,
you wouldn't be afraid of anything?

877
01:06:13,713 --> 01:06:16,649
Not nobody, not nohow!

878
01:06:16,983 --> 01:06:19,385
-Not even a rhinoceros?
-Imposserous!

879
01:06:19,685 --> 01:06:23,790
-How about a hippopotamus?
-Why, I'd trash him from top to bottomus!

880
01:06:23,856 --> 01:06:26,893
-Suppose you met an elephant?
-I'd wrap him up in cellophant!

881
01:06:26,959 --> 01:06:30,830
-What if it were a brontosaurus?
-I'd show him who was King of the Forest!

882
01:06:30,897 --> 01:06:32,432
-How?
-How?

883
01:06:33,933 --> 01:06:34,934
Courage!

884
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:37,136
What makes a king
out of a slave?

885
01:06:37,203 --> 01:06:38,004
Courage!

886
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:41,073
What makes the flag
on the mast to wave?

887
01:06:41,641 --> 01:06:42,575
Courage!

888
01:06:42,642 --> 01:06:47,313
What makes the elephant charge his tusk
in the misty mist, or the dusky dusk?

889
01:06:48,581 --> 01:06:51,684
What makes the
muskrat guard his musk?

890
01:06:52,452 --> 01:06:53,319
Courage!

891
01:06:53,386 --> 01:06:55,721
What makes the sphinx
the Seventh Wonder?

892
01:06:55,788 --> 01:06:56,656
Courage!

893
01:06:56,722 --> 01:06:59,258
What makes the dawn
come up like thunder?

894
01:07:00,293 --> 01:07:01,360
Courage!

895
01:07:01,627 --> 01:07:03,663
What makes the Hottentot so hot?

896
01:07:03,729 --> 01:07:05,798
What puts the "ape" in apricot?

897
01:07:06,065 --> 01:07:08,501
What have they got
that I ain't got?

898
01:07:08,634 --> 01:07:09,368
Courage!

899
01:07:09,435 --> 01:07:11,070
You can say that again.

900
01:07:15,541 --> 01:07:17,510
The Wizard says, "Go away! "

901
01:07:23,783 --> 01:07:24,951
Go away?

902
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:29,288
Looks like we came a
long way for nothing.

903
01:07:31,491 --> 01:07:33,292
And I was so happy!

904
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,362
I thought I was on my way home.

905
01:07:36,529 --> 01:07:37,864
Don't cry, Dorothy.

906
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:39,432
We'll get you to the Wizard.

907
01:07:39,499 --> 01:07:41,100
We certainly are.

908
01:07:42,034 --> 01:07:45,972
Auntie Em was so good to me,
and I never appreciated it.

909
01:07:46,839 --> 01:07:49,642
Running away and
hurting her feelings.

910
01:07:50,309 --> 01:07:52,478
Professor Marvel
said she was sick.

911
01:07:54,013 --> 01:07:55,481
She may be dying...

912
01:07:56,115 --> 01:07:57,817
...and it's all my fault.

913
01:08:00,987 --> 01:08:02,722
I'll never forgive myself!

914
01:08:03,756 --> 01:08:05,324
Never, never, never!

915
01:08:09,862 --> 01:08:12,398
Please, don't cry anymore.

916
01:08:12,965 --> 01:08:16,035
I'll get you in to
the Wizard somehow.

917
01:08:16,436 --> 01:08:19,972
Come on. I had an
Aunt Em myself once!

918
01:08:40,893 --> 01:08:43,729
Wait a minute, fellows.
I was just thinking...

919
01:08:43,963 --> 01:08:46,399
I really don't want to
see the Wizard this much.

920
01:08:46,466 --> 01:08:48,434
I better wait for you outside.

921
01:08:48,568 --> 01:08:51,504
-What's the matter?
-He's just scared again.

922
01:08:51,571 --> 01:08:54,307
Don't you know the Wizard
will give you some courage?

923
01:08:54,373 --> 01:08:57,009
I'd be too scared
to ask him for it.

924
01:08:57,743 --> 01:08:59,846
Well then, we'll
ask him for you.

925
01:09:00,179 --> 01:09:01,881
I'd sooner wait outside.

926
01:09:02,482 --> 01:09:03,716
Why? Why?

927
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:06,886
Because I'm still scared!

928
01:09:11,657 --> 01:09:14,427
-What happened?
-Somebody pulled my tail!

929
01:09:15,228 --> 01:09:16,729
You did it yourself!

930
01:09:19,432 --> 01:09:20,433
Come on.

931
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:26,506
Come forward!

932
01:09:26,839 --> 01:09:28,608
Tell me when it's over!

933
01:09:39,919 --> 01:09:41,754
Look at that! Look at that!

934
01:09:45,925 --> 01:09:48,094
I want to go home!

935
01:09:48,761 --> 01:09:51,831
I am Oz...

936
01:09:52,331 --> 01:09:54,500
...the great and powerful!

937
01:09:55,067 --> 01:09:56,402
Who are you?

938
01:09:58,638 --> 01:10:00,239
Who are you?

939
01:10:06,078 --> 01:10:08,981
If you please, I am Dorothy...

940
01:10:10,082 --> 01:10:11,918
...the small and meek.

941
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,388
We've come to ask-

942
01:10:15,755 --> 01:10:16,889
Silence!

943
01:10:18,658 --> 01:10:20,026
Jiminy Crickets!

944
01:10:20,426 --> 01:10:25,298
The great and powerful Oz
knows why you have come.

945
01:10:26,799 --> 01:10:29,502
Step forward, Tin Man!

946
01:10:35,908 --> 01:10:39,745
You dare to come to
me for a heart, do you?

947
01:10:40,313 --> 01:10:45,284
You clinking, clanking, clattering
collection of caliginous junk!

948
01:10:50,022 --> 01:10:51,057
Yes, sir.

949
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:52,759
Yes, Your Honor.

950
01:10:53,059 --> 01:10:55,661
You see, a while back...

951
01:10:55,928 --> 01:10:58,498
...we were walking down
the Yellow Brick Road, and-

952
01:10:58,564 --> 01:10:59,599
Quiet!

953
01:11:02,268 --> 01:11:04,403
And you, Scarecrow...

954
01:11:04,804 --> 01:11:07,507
...have the effrontery
to ask for a brain...

955
01:11:08,307 --> 01:11:11,844
...you billowing
bale of bovine fodder!

956
01:11:14,213 --> 01:11:16,382
Yes, Your Honor. I
mean, Your Excellency.

957
01:11:16,449 --> 01:11:18,284
I mean, Your Wizardry!

958
01:11:18,951 --> 01:11:19,919
Enough!

959
01:11:21,421 --> 01:11:23,389
And you, Lion!

960
01:11:29,695 --> 01:11:30,663
Well?

961
01:11:37,503 --> 01:11:39,772
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself...

962
01:11:40,206 --> 01:11:43,109
...frightening him like that
when he came to you for help!

963
01:11:43,176 --> 01:11:45,378
Silence, whippersnapper!

964
01:11:46,078 --> 01:11:50,750
The beneficent Oz has every
intention of granting your requests!

965
01:11:51,684 --> 01:11:54,821
What's that? What'd
he say? What'd he say?

966
01:11:55,054 --> 01:11:58,691
But first, you must
prove yourselves worthy...

967
01:11:58,991 --> 01:12:02,428
...by performing
a very small task.

968
01:12:03,763 --> 01:12:06,933
Bring me the broomstick
of the Witch of the West.

969
01:12:07,733 --> 01:12:10,703
But if we do that, we'll
have to kill her to get it!

970
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:13,072
Bring me her broomstick...

971
01:12:13,473 --> 01:12:15,908
...and I'll grant your requests.

972
01:12:16,776 --> 01:12:18,077
Now, go!

973
01:12:19,512 --> 01:12:21,414
But what if she kills us first?

974
01:12:21,481 --> 01:12:23,149
I said, "Go!"

975
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:09,788
"I'd turn back if I were you! "

976
01:13:34,346 --> 01:13:35,848
Oh, look!

977
01:13:40,853 --> 01:13:43,155
I believe there're
spooks around here.

978
01:13:43,889 --> 01:13:46,725
That's ridiculous!
Spooks! That's silly.

979
01:13:47,192 --> 01:13:49,361
Don't you believe in spooks?

980
01:13:49,428 --> 01:13:50,729
No. Why, only-

981
01:13:52,464 --> 01:13:53,699
Tin Man!

982
01:14:01,473 --> 01:14:02,574
Are you all right?

983
01:14:02,641 --> 01:14:04,777
I do believe in spooks.
I do believe in spooks.

984
01:14:04,843 --> 01:14:06,578
I do, I do, I do, I do.

985
01:14:06,645 --> 01:14:08,981
I do believe in spooks.
I do believe in spooks!

986
01:14:09,048 --> 01:14:11,684
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do!

987
01:14:13,152 --> 01:14:16,622
You'll believe in more than that
before I'm finished with you.

988
01:14:18,457 --> 01:14:21,827
Take your army to the Haunted Forest
and bring me the girl and her dog.

989
01:14:21,894 --> 01:14:25,264
Do as you like with the others,
but I want her alive and unharmed!

990
01:14:25,331 --> 01:14:28,000
They'll give you no
trouble. I promise you that.

991
01:14:28,067 --> 01:14:32,004
I've sent a little insect on ahead
to take the fight out of them.

992
01:14:32,805 --> 01:14:37,576
Take special care of those ruby slippers.
I want those most of all. Now, fly!

993
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:40,946
Fly! Bring me that
girl and her slippers!

994
01:14:41,347 --> 01:14:43,882
Fly! Fly! Fly!

995
01:15:12,211 --> 01:15:12,878
Help!

996
01:15:12,945 --> 01:15:14,313
Help! Help!

997
01:15:14,947 --> 01:15:16,115
Go away now!

998
01:15:17,016 --> 01:15:18,183
Help! Help!

999
01:15:19,485 --> 01:15:22,254
Toto! Toto! Help! Toto!

1000
01:15:40,673 --> 01:15:42,141
What happened to you?

1001
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:44,643
They tore my legs off
and threw them over there!

1002
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:47,112
Then they took my chest
out and threw it over there!

1003
01:15:47,179 --> 01:15:50,916
-Well, that's you all over.
-They sure knocked the stuffing out of you.

1004
01:15:50,983 --> 01:15:53,152
Don't stand there
talking! Put me together!

1005
01:15:53,218 --> 01:15:54,720
We've got to find Dorothy!

1006
01:15:54,787 --> 01:15:56,155
Now, let's see...

1007
01:15:59,258 --> 01:16:01,226
What a nice little dog.

1008
01:16:05,898 --> 01:16:09,201
And you, my dear, what
an unexpected pleasure.

1009
01:16:09,735 --> 01:16:13,038
It's so kind of you to
visit me in my loneliness.

1010
01:16:15,474 --> 01:16:18,510
What are you going to do with
my dog? Give him back to me!

1011
01:16:18,577 --> 01:16:22,982
All in good time, my little
pretty, all in good time.

1012
01:16:23,215 --> 01:16:25,250
Please, give me back my dog!

1013
01:16:25,317 --> 01:16:27,186
Certainly, certainly...

1014
01:16:27,786 --> 01:16:30,089
...when you give
me those slippers.

1015
01:16:30,723 --> 01:16:33,058
But the Good Witch of
the North told me not to.

1016
01:16:33,125 --> 01:16:34,226
Very well.

1017
01:16:34,793 --> 01:16:36,929
Throw that basket in
the river and drown him.

1018
01:16:36,996 --> 01:16:38,731
No! No. No. Here.

1019
01:16:38,897 --> 01:16:41,433
You can have your slippers
but give me back Toto!

1020
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,302
That's a good little girl.

1021
01:16:43,369 --> 01:16:45,604
I knew you'd see reason!

1022
01:16:49,274 --> 01:16:52,611
I'm sorry. I didn't do it.
Can I still have my dog?

1023
01:16:52,778 --> 01:16:55,781
No! Fool that I am, I
should have remembered...

1024
01:16:57,282 --> 01:16:59,685
...those slippers
will never come off...

1025
01:16:59,785 --> 01:17:02,321
...as long as you're alive.

1026
01:17:03,789 --> 01:17:07,326
But that's not what's
worrying me. It's how to do it.

1027
01:17:07,893 --> 01:17:10,262
These things must
be done delicately...

1028
01:17:10,929 --> 01:17:12,831
...or you hurt the spell.

1029
01:17:13,399 --> 01:17:14,566
Run, Toto! Run!

1030
01:17:14,633 --> 01:17:16,135
Catch him, you fool!

1031
01:17:26,178 --> 01:17:27,179
Run, Toto!

1032
01:17:28,914 --> 01:17:30,282
Run, Toto! Run!

1033
01:17:32,051 --> 01:17:34,453
He got away! He got away!

1034
01:17:35,387 --> 01:17:38,924
Which is more than you
will! Drat you and your dog!

1035
01:17:39,258 --> 01:17:42,094
You've been more trouble
to me than you're worth...

1036
01:17:42,161 --> 01:17:44,163
...but it'll soon be over now!

1037
01:17:47,032 --> 01:17:50,803
Do you see that? That's how much
longer you've got to be alive!

1038
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:53,872
And it isn't long, my
pretty. It isn't long!

1039
01:17:54,039 --> 01:17:56,442
I can't wait forever
to get those shoes!

1040
01:18:18,864 --> 01:18:20,165
I'm frightened.

1041
01:18:21,233 --> 01:18:23,736
I'm frightened, Auntie
Em, I'm frightened!

1042
01:18:27,239 --> 01:18:28,207
Dorothy?

1043
01:18:29,108 --> 01:18:31,343
Dorothy, where are you?

1044
01:18:31,777 --> 01:18:33,679
It's me, it's Auntie Em.

1045
01:18:34,046 --> 01:18:36,849
We're trying to find
you! Where are you?

1046
01:18:37,516 --> 01:18:39,485
I'm here in Oz, Auntie Em!

1047
01:18:39,752 --> 01:18:42,054
I'm locked up in
the Witch's castle...

1048
01:18:42,221 --> 01:18:45,057
...and I'm trying to get
home to you, Auntie Em!

1049
01:18:45,891 --> 01:18:48,961
Auntie Em, don't go
away! I'm frightened!

1050
01:18:49,995 --> 01:18:51,764
Come back! Come back!

1051
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:54,566
"Auntie Em. Auntie
Em, come back!"

1052
01:18:54,933 --> 01:18:57,102
I'll give you
Auntie Em, my pretty!

1053
01:19:23,996 --> 01:19:25,464
Look! There's Toto!

1054
01:19:26,165 --> 01:19:27,700
Where'd he come from?

1055
01:19:29,201 --> 01:19:32,671
Why, don't you see? He's
come to take us to Dorothy!

1056
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,241
Come on, fellows!

1057
01:19:55,094 --> 01:19:57,129
I hope my strength holds out.

1058
01:19:57,262 --> 01:19:59,098
I hope your tail holds out.

1059
01:20:12,211 --> 01:20:13,345
What's that?

1060
01:20:14,413 --> 01:20:16,448
That's the castle
of the Wicked Witch!

1061
01:20:16,515 --> 01:20:18,317
Dorothy's in that awful place?

1062
01:20:18,384 --> 01:20:21,854
I hate to think of her in
there. We've got to get her out!

1063
01:20:21,987 --> 01:20:24,523
Don't cry now. We haven't
got the oilcan with us...

1064
01:20:24,590 --> 01:20:26,659
...and you've been
squeaking enough.

1065
01:20:26,859 --> 01:20:28,360
Who's them?

1066
01:20:43,275 --> 01:20:45,344
I've got a plan
how to get in there.

1067
01:20:45,411 --> 01:20:47,112
Fine. He's got a plan.

1068
01:20:47,179 --> 01:20:49,581
-And you're going to lead us.
-Yeah.

1069
01:20:50,249 --> 01:20:51,817
-Me?
-Yes, you.

1070
01:20:53,085 --> 01:20:55,688
-I gotta get her out of there?
-That's right.

1071
01:20:57,156 --> 01:20:59,658
All right, I'll go in
there for Dorothy...

1072
01:21:00,059 --> 01:21:02,161
...Wicked Witch or
no Wicked Witch...

1073
01:21:02,227 --> 01:21:05,064
...guards or no guards,
I'll tear 'em apart.

1074
01:21:06,498 --> 01:21:09,668
I may not come out alive
but I'm going in there.

1075
01:21:10,102 --> 01:21:12,571
There's only one thing
I want you fellows to do.

1076
01:21:12,638 --> 01:21:13,872
What's that?

1077
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:15,774
Talk me out of it.

1078
01:21:18,410 --> 01:21:19,745
-No, you don't!
-Oh, no!

1079
01:21:19,812 --> 01:21:21,280
Now, wait a minute.

1080
01:22:22,174 --> 01:22:23,776
I've got another idea.

1081
01:22:23,842 --> 01:22:26,478
Do you think it'll be
polite, dropping in like this?

1082
01:22:26,545 --> 01:22:27,546
Come on.

1083
01:23:00,491 --> 01:23:02,159
Where do we go now?

1084
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:03,461
Yeah.

1085
01:23:05,396 --> 01:23:06,430
There!

1086
01:23:16,307 --> 01:23:19,210
Wait! We'd better make sure.
Dorothy, are you in there?

1087
01:23:19,276 --> 01:23:20,277
It's us!

1088
01:23:20,478 --> 01:23:22,513
Yes, it's me!

1089
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,248
She's locked me in!

1090
01:23:24,315 --> 01:23:27,351
It's her. We gotta get
her out! Open the door!

1091
01:23:27,418 --> 01:23:29,387
Hurry! Please, hurry!

1092
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,455
The hourglass is almost empty!

1093
01:23:31,522 --> 01:23:32,623
Stand back!

1094
01:23:49,407 --> 01:23:50,641
Toto! Toto!

1095
01:23:50,708 --> 01:23:52,677
-Did they hurt you?
-I knew you'd come!

1096
01:23:52,743 --> 01:23:54,011
I knew you would!

1097
01:23:54,078 --> 01:23:56,280
Hurry, we've got
no time to lose!

1098
01:24:08,225 --> 01:24:09,794
Going so soon?

1099
01:24:10,161 --> 01:24:11,862
I wouldn't hear of it.

1100
01:24:12,196 --> 01:24:15,966
Why, my little
party's just beginning.

1101
01:24:16,067 --> 01:24:18,369
Trapped! Trapped
like mice, rats!

1102
01:24:27,378 --> 01:24:29,980
That's right. Don't
hurt them right away.

1103
01:24:30,481 --> 01:24:33,117
We'll let them think
about it a little first.

1104
01:24:44,028 --> 01:24:46,464
Seize them! Stop
them, you fools!

1105
01:24:46,530 --> 01:24:49,700
Stop them! Seize
them! Seize them!

1106
01:24:59,677 --> 01:25:01,712
There they go!
Now we've got them!

1107
01:25:01,779 --> 01:25:04,181
Half you go this way,
half you go that way!

1108
01:25:04,248 --> 01:25:05,516
Hurry! Hurry!

1109
01:25:13,224 --> 01:25:14,692
Where do we go now?

1110
01:25:15,393 --> 01:25:17,061
This way, come on!

1111
01:25:24,702 --> 01:25:25,836
Back! Back!

1112
01:25:44,555 --> 01:25:45,556
Well!

1113
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:49,160
Ring around the rosie!
A pocket full of spears!

1114
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:51,796
Thought you'd be
pretty foxy, didn't you?

1115
01:25:52,063 --> 01:25:56,233
The last to go will see the
first three go before her!

1116
01:25:57,802 --> 01:25:59,704
And her mangy little dog, too!

1117
01:26:07,912 --> 01:26:10,081
How about a little
fire, Scarecrow?

1118
01:26:10,147 --> 01:26:12,249
No! No! No!

1119
01:26:12,416 --> 01:26:15,453
Help! I'm burning! I'm burning!

1120
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,588
Don't throw that water!

1121
01:26:19,957 --> 01:26:22,360
You cursed brat!
Look what you've done!

1122
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:24,562
I'm melting! Melting!

1123
01:26:25,629 --> 01:26:27,765
What a world! What a world!

1124
01:26:27,832 --> 01:26:32,670
Who would have thought a good little girl
could destroy my beautiful wickedness?

1125
01:26:33,504 --> 01:26:35,639
Look out! Look out!

1126
01:26:36,273 --> 01:26:37,375
I'm going.

1127
01:26:54,091 --> 01:26:56,227
She's dead. You've killed her.

1128
01:26:56,293 --> 01:26:59,163
I didn't mean to kill
her, really I didn't.

1129
01:27:00,798 --> 01:27:02,633
It's just that he was on fire!

1130
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:05,269
Hail to Dorothy! The
Wicked Witch is dead!

1131
01:27:05,369 --> 01:27:08,839
Hail! Hail to Dorothy!
The Wicked Witch is dead!

1132
01:27:09,607 --> 01:27:10,808
The broom!

1133
01:27:10,875 --> 01:27:11,909
May we have it?

1134
01:27:11,976 --> 01:27:13,911
Please. And take it with you.

1135
01:27:14,078 --> 01:27:15,479
Thank you so much!

1136
01:27:15,946 --> 01:27:19,150
Now we can go back to the Wizard and
tell him the Wicked Witch is dead!

1137
01:27:19,216 --> 01:27:20,851
The Wicked Witch is dead!

1138
01:27:20,918 --> 01:27:23,054
Can I believe my eyes?

1139
01:27:23,587 --> 01:27:25,456
Why have you come back?

1140
01:27:27,558 --> 01:27:30,494
Please, sir. We've
done what you told us.

1141
01:27:30,795 --> 01:27:34,231
We've brought you the broomstick
of the Wicked Witch of the West.

1142
01:27:34,298 --> 01:27:35,633
We melted her.

1143
01:27:36,967 --> 01:27:39,337
You liquidated her, eh?

1144
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:41,272
Very resourceful!

1145
01:27:41,339 --> 01:27:45,976
Yes, sir. So we'd like you to keep
your promise to us, if you please, sir.

1146
01:27:46,110 --> 01:27:48,913
Not so fast! Not so fast!

1147
01:27:49,613 --> 01:27:52,316
I'll have to give the
matter a little thought!

1148
01:27:52,416 --> 01:27:54,919
Go away, and come back tomorrow!

1149
01:27:55,353 --> 01:27:56,387
Tomorrow?

1150
01:27:56,887 --> 01:27:59,090
But I want to go home now!

1151
01:27:59,957 --> 01:28:01,826
You've had plenty
of time already!

1152
01:28:01,892 --> 01:28:02,793
Yeah!

1153
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:06,397
Do not arouse the wrath of
the great and powerful Oz!

1154
01:28:07,231 --> 01:28:09,300
I said, "Come back tomorrow!"

1155
01:28:10,434 --> 01:28:10,497
If you were really great and
powerful, you'd keep your promises!

1156
01:28:10,501 --> 01:28:13,537
If you were really great and
powerful, you'd keep your promises!

1157
01:28:13,604 --> 01:28:16,907
Do you presume to
criticize the great Oz?

1158
01:28:17,541 --> 01:28:19,777
You ungrateful creatures!

1159
01:28:20,044 --> 01:28:23,848
Think yourselves lucky that I'm
giving you audience tomorrow...

1160
01:28:24,081 --> 01:28:26,617
...instead of 20 years from now!

1161
01:28:28,652 --> 01:28:30,921
The great Oz has spoken!

1162
01:28:33,190 --> 01:28:36,427
Pay no attention to that
man behind the curtain.

1163
01:28:37,128 --> 01:28:40,297
The great Oz has spoken!

1164
01:28:40,731 --> 01:28:41,932
Who are you?

1165
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:45,036
I am the great and powerful...

1166
01:28:45,136 --> 01:28:46,871
...Wizard of Oz.

1167
01:28:46,937 --> 01:28:47,972
You are?

1168
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:50,107
I don't believe you!

1169
01:28:50,207 --> 01:28:53,611
No, I'm afraid it's true.
There's no other wizard except me.

1170
01:28:53,778 --> 01:28:54,912
You humbug!

1171
01:28:54,979 --> 01:28:55,946
Yeah!

1172
01:28:56,547 --> 01:28:59,517
Yes, that's exactly
so. I'm a humbug.

1173
01:29:00,951 --> 01:29:02,720
You're a very bad man!

1174
01:29:03,954 --> 01:29:06,390
No, my dear. I'm
a very good man.

1175
01:29:06,490 --> 01:29:09,427
I'm just a very bad wizard.

1176
01:29:10,227 --> 01:29:12,363
What about the heart
that you promised Tin Man?

1177
01:29:12,463 --> 01:29:14,799
And the courage that you
promised Cowardly Lion?

1178
01:29:14,865 --> 01:29:16,367
And Scarecrow's brain?

1179
01:29:16,434 --> 01:29:20,604
Why, anybody can have a brain.
That's a very mediocre commodity.

1180
01:29:20,771 --> 01:29:23,808
Every pusillanimous creature
that crawls on the earth...

1181
01:29:23,874 --> 01:29:26,911
...or slinks through
slimy seas has a brain!

1182
01:29:27,211 --> 01:29:29,547
Back where I come from
we have universities...

1183
01:29:29,613 --> 01:29:33,217
...seats of great learning, where
men go to become great thinkers.

1184
01:29:33,417 --> 01:29:35,753
When they come out, they
think deep thoughts...

1185
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:37,755
...with no more
brains than you have.

1186
01:29:37,822 --> 01:29:41,225
But they have one thing
you haven't got: A diploma!

1187
01:29:41,692 --> 01:29:45,863
Therefore, by virtue of the
authority vested in me...

1188
01:29:46,063 --> 01:29:49,767
...by the Universitatus
Committeeatum E Pluribus Unum...

1189
01:29:50,101 --> 01:29:52,336
...I hereby confer upon you...

1190
01:29:52,436 --> 01:29:54,939
...the honorary degree of Th.D.

1191
01:29:56,173 --> 01:29:57,108
"Th.D."?

1192
01:29:57,174 --> 01:29:59,877
Yeah, that's "Doctor
of Thinkology."

1193
01:30:00,077 --> 01:30:03,447
"The sum of the square roots of any
two sides of an isosceles triangle...

1194
01:30:03,514 --> 01:30:06,317
"...is equal to the square
root of the remaining side."

1195
01:30:07,551 --> 01:30:08,819
Joy! Rapture!

1196
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:10,788
I've got a brain!

1197
01:30:11,022 --> 01:30:12,757
How can I ever thank you enough?

1198
01:30:12,823 --> 01:30:17,595
Well, you can't. As for you, my fine friend,
you are a victim of disorganized thinking.

1199
01:30:17,695 --> 01:30:19,764
You're under the
unfortunate delusion...

1200
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:23,067
...that simply because you run away
from danger you have no courage.

1201
01:30:23,134 --> 01:30:25,803
You are confusing
courage with wisdom.

1202
01:30:25,870 --> 01:30:29,640
Back where I come from we
have men who are called heroes.

1203
01:30:30,041 --> 01:30:33,077
Once a year they take their
fortitude out of mothballs...

1204
01:30:33,144 --> 01:30:35,713
...and parade it down the
main street of the city.

1205
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:38,115
And they have no more
courage than you have.

1206
01:30:38,182 --> 01:30:41,085
But they have one thing
that you haven't got:

1207
01:30:41,585 --> 01:30:42,586
A medal!

1208
01:30:43,387 --> 01:30:46,691
Therefore, for
meritorious conduct...

1209
01:30:47,158 --> 01:30:51,762
...extraordinary valor, conspicuous
bravery against wicked witches...

1210
01:30:51,862 --> 01:30:54,265
...I award you the Triple Cross.

1211
01:30:54,965 --> 01:30:58,102
You are now a member of
the Legion of Courage!

1212
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:04,442
Shucks, folks, I'm speechless!

1213
01:31:05,543 --> 01:31:09,347
As for you, my galvanized
friend, you want a heart!

1214
01:31:09,613 --> 01:31:12,483
You don't know how lucky
you are not to have one.

1215
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:16,821
Hearts will never be practical
until they can be made unbreakable.

1216
01:31:17,621 --> 01:31:19,357
But I still want one.

1217
01:31:19,990 --> 01:31:24,061
Back where I come from there are men
who do nothing all day but good deeds.

1218
01:31:24,261 --> 01:31:26,263
They are called...

1219
01:31:28,065 --> 01:31:31,402
...good-deed-doers and their
hearts are no bigger than yours.

1220
01:31:31,469 --> 01:31:35,139
But they have one thing you
haven't got: A testimonial!

1221
01:31:35,539 --> 01:31:38,709
Therefore, in consideration
of your kindness...

1222
01:31:38,776 --> 01:31:41,746
...I take pleasure at this
time in presenting you...

1223
01:31:41,812 --> 01:31:45,116
...with a small token of
our esteem and affection.

1224
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:47,952
And remember, my
sentimental friend...

1225
01:31:48,552 --> 01:31:51,522
...that a heart is not
judged by how much you love...

1226
01:31:51,989 --> 01:31:54,525
...but by how much you
are loved by others.

1227
01:31:58,629 --> 01:32:00,264
It ticks! Listen!

1228
01:32:00,898 --> 01:32:02,233
Look, it ticks!

1229
01:32:03,401 --> 01:32:04,969
Read what my medal says.

1230
01:32:05,036 --> 01:32:05,870
"Courage"!

1231
01:32:05,936 --> 01:32:08,339
Ain't it the truth?
Ain't it the truth?

1232
01:32:08,739 --> 01:32:10,341
They're all wonderful.

1233
01:32:11,642 --> 01:32:14,011
-What about Dorothy?
-Yes, how about Dorothy?

1234
01:32:14,845 --> 01:32:16,914
-Dorothy next!
-Yes, Dorothy.

1235
01:32:16,981 --> 01:32:19,950
I don't think there's anything
in that black bag for me.

1236
01:32:20,718 --> 01:32:22,987
You force me into a
cataclysmic decision.

1237
01:32:23,054 --> 01:32:27,258
The only way to get Dorothy back to
Kansas is for me to take her there myself!

1238
01:32:28,893 --> 01:32:30,428
Will you? Could you?

1239
01:32:32,596 --> 01:32:34,899
Are you a clever enough
wizard to manage it?

1240
01:32:34,965 --> 01:32:38,969
Child, you cut me to the quick!
I'm an old Kansas man myself...

1241
01:32:39,136 --> 01:32:42,106
...born and bred in the heart
of the western wilderness...

1242
01:32:42,173 --> 01:32:44,208
...premier balloonist
par excellence...

1243
01:32:44,275 --> 01:32:47,511
...for the Miracle Wonderland
Carnival Company. Until one day...

1244
01:32:47,578 --> 01:32:51,282
...while performing spectacular
feats of stratospheric skill...

1245
01:32:51,415 --> 01:32:56,220
...never before attempted by civilized
man, an unfortunate phenomenon occurred.

1246
01:32:56,487 --> 01:32:58,622
The balloon failed
to return to the fair.

1247
01:32:58,689 --> 01:32:59,490
It did?

1248
01:32:59,557 --> 01:33:00,891
Weren't you frightened?

1249
01:33:00,958 --> 01:33:04,662
Frightened? You are talking to a man
who has laughed in the face of death...

1250
01:33:04,729 --> 01:33:07,898
...sneered at doom and
chuckled at catastrophe.

1251
01:33:08,065 --> 01:33:09,433
I was petrified.

1252
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:12,803
Then suddenly the wind changed
and the balloon floated down...

1253
01:33:12,870 --> 01:33:17,375
...into the heart of this noble city
where I was instantly acclaimed Oz...

1254
01:33:17,475 --> 01:33:19,610
...the First Wizard Deluxe!

1255
01:33:20,177 --> 01:33:23,147
Times being what they
were, I accepted the job...

1256
01:33:23,381 --> 01:33:27,151
...retaining my balloon against
the advent of a quick getaway.

1257
01:33:27,818 --> 01:33:31,856
And in that balloon, my dear
Dorothy, you and I will return...

1258
01:33:31,922 --> 01:33:34,358
...to the land of
"e pluribus unum"!

1259
01:33:47,379 --> 01:33:51,183
This is positively the finest
exhibition ever to be shown.

1260
01:33:52,017 --> 01:33:54,253
Yes, well, be that as it may...

1261
01:33:54,319 --> 01:33:58,023
...I, your Wizard
per ardua et alta...

1262
01:33:58,223 --> 01:34:03,428
...am about to embark upon a hazardous
and technically unexplainable journey...

1263
01:34:03,762 --> 01:34:06,298
...into the outer stratosphere!

1264
01:34:10,102 --> 01:34:15,340
To confer, converse and otherwise
hobnob with my brother wizards.

1265
01:34:15,774 --> 01:34:19,344
And I hereby decree
that until what time...

1266
01:34:19,511 --> 01:34:23,282
...if any, that I
return, the Scarecrow...

1267
01:34:23,582 --> 01:34:28,553
...by virtue of his highly superior
brains, shall rule in my stead...

1268
01:34:28,921 --> 01:34:33,358
...assisted by the Tin Man, by
virtue of his magnificent heart...

1269
01:34:33,725 --> 01:34:37,296
...and the Lion, by
virtue of his courage!

1270
01:34:37,729 --> 01:34:40,232
Obey them as you would me.

1271
01:34:40,299 --> 01:34:41,533
Thank you.

1272
01:34:44,169 --> 01:34:45,137
Toto!

1273
01:34:45,203 --> 01:34:46,572
Come back! Toto!

1274
01:34:47,272 --> 01:34:49,508
Don't go without me!
I'll be right back!

1275
01:34:49,575 --> 01:34:50,976
Stop that dog!

1276
01:34:51,043 --> 01:34:55,480
This is highly irregular procedure!
This is absolutely unprecedented!

1277
01:34:55,547 --> 01:34:56,848
Ruined my exit!

1278
01:34:57,482 --> 01:34:59,151
Come back! Come back!

1279
01:34:59,284 --> 01:35:01,687
Don't go without me!
Please, come back!

1280
01:35:01,954 --> 01:35:04,756
I can't come back! I
don't know how it works!

1281
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:06,658
Goodbye, folks!

1282
01:35:06,925 --> 01:35:07,993
Goodbye!

1283
01:35:12,464 --> 01:35:13,999
Now I'll never get home!

1284
01:35:16,134 --> 01:35:17,970
Stay with us then, Dorothy.

1285
01:35:18,537 --> 01:35:19,905
We all love you.

1286
01:35:20,505 --> 01:35:22,474
We don't want you to go.

1287
01:35:23,075 --> 01:35:24,843
That's very kind of you...

1288
01:35:25,544 --> 01:35:27,879
...but this could
never be like Kansas.

1289
01:35:28,914 --> 01:35:32,618
Auntie Em must have stopped
wondering what happened to me by now.

1290
01:35:33,418 --> 01:35:35,654
Scarecrow, what
am I going to do?

1291
01:35:37,923 --> 01:35:38,890
Look!

1292
01:35:39,625 --> 01:35:41,660
Here's someone who can help you!

1293
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:19,398
-Will you help me? Can you help me?
-You don't need to be helped any longer.

1294
01:36:19,464 --> 01:36:22,467
You've always had the
power to go back to Kansas.

1295
01:36:22,668 --> 01:36:23,735
I have?

1296
01:36:23,802 --> 01:36:25,537
Why didn't you tell her before?

1297
01:36:25,604 --> 01:36:29,474
Because she wouldn't have believed
me. She had to learn it for herself.

1298
01:36:29,708 --> 01:36:31,777
What have you learned, Dorothy?

1299
01:36:35,614 --> 01:36:40,586
I think that it wasn't enough just to
want to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.

1300
01:36:41,687 --> 01:36:45,791
And it's that if I ever go looking
for my heart's desire again...

1301
01:36:46,491 --> 01:36:49,228
...I won't look any further
than my own backyard...

1302
01:36:50,062 --> 01:36:52,064
...because if it isn't there...

1303
01:36:52,564 --> 01:36:54,967
...I never really
lost it to begin with.

1304
01:36:55,834 --> 01:36:57,069
Is that right?

1305
01:36:57,436 --> 01:36:59,037
That's all it is!

1306
01:36:59,104 --> 01:37:02,341
But that's so easy! I should
have thought of it for you.

1307
01:37:02,407 --> 01:37:06,245
-I should have felt it in my heart.
-No. She had to find it out for herself.

1308
01:37:06,311 --> 01:37:09,581
Now those magic slippers will
take you home in two seconds!

1309
01:37:09,715 --> 01:37:11,683
-Toto, too?
-Toto, too.

1310
01:37:12,718 --> 01:37:14,486
-Now?
-Whenever you wish.

1311
01:37:14,886 --> 01:37:18,290
Oh, dear, that's too
wonderful to be true!

1312
01:37:20,259 --> 01:37:23,929
It's going to be so
hard to say goodbye.

1313
01:37:25,063 --> 01:37:26,531
I love you all, too.

1314
01:37:29,635 --> 01:37:31,003
Goodbye, Tin Man.

1315
01:37:32,571 --> 01:37:33,672
Don't cry.

1316
01:37:34,406 --> 01:37:36,174
You'll rust so dreadfully.

1317
01:37:38,110 --> 01:37:40,145
Here. Here's your oilcan.

1318
01:37:42,781 --> 01:37:43,782
Goodbye.

1319
01:37:43,882 --> 01:37:47,052
Now I know I've got a
heart 'cause it's breaking.

1320
01:37:51,089 --> 01:37:52,457
Goodbye, Lion.

1321
01:37:52,824 --> 01:37:54,726
You know, I know
it isn't right...

1322
01:37:54,793 --> 01:37:58,397
...but I'm gonna miss the way
you used to holler for help...

1323
01:37:58,630 --> 01:38:00,732
...before you
found your courage.

1324
01:38:01,333 --> 01:38:04,636
I would never have found it
if it hadn't been for you.

1325
01:38:10,142 --> 01:38:12,678
I think I'll miss
you most of all.

1326
01:38:18,150 --> 01:38:19,551
Are you ready now?

1327
01:38:19,718 --> 01:38:20,752
Yes.

1328
01:38:22,888 --> 01:38:24,289
Say goodbye, Toto.

1329
01:38:27,726 --> 01:38:29,428
Yes, I'm ready now.

1330
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:34,032
Then close your eyes and tap
your heels together three times.

1331
01:38:36,668 --> 01:38:38,403
And think to yourself:

1332
01:38:38,971 --> 01:38:44,409
"There's no place like home.
There's no place like home."

1333
01:38:45,711 --> 01:38:48,213
There's no place like home.

1334
01:38:49,281 --> 01:38:51,783
There's no place like home.

1335
01:38:52,718 --> 01:38:55,220
There's no place like home.

1336
01:38:56,255 --> 01:38:58,757
There's no place like home.

1337
01:38:59,791 --> 01:39:01,793
There's no place like home.

1338
01:39:05,530 --> 01:39:07,532
There's no place like home.

1339
01:39:08,734 --> 01:39:10,736
There's no place like home.

1340
01:39:13,005 --> 01:39:14,039
Wake up, honey.

1341
01:39:14,106 --> 01:39:16,108
There's no place like home.

1342
01:39:17,009 --> 01:39:19,011
There's no place like home.

1343
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:23,081
There's no place...

1344
01:39:26,084 --> 01:39:29,288
Dorothy! Dorothy, dear.
It's Aunt Em, darling.

1345
01:39:29,688 --> 01:39:31,823
Auntie Em, it's you!

1346
01:39:32,424 --> 01:39:34,526
Hello, there! Anybody home?

1347
01:39:34,626 --> 01:39:38,964
I just dropped by because I heard the
little girl got caught in the big...

1348
01:39:39,598 --> 01:39:41,500
Well, she seems all right now!

1349
01:39:41,733 --> 01:39:45,637
She got quite a bump on the head. We
thought for a minute she'd leave us.

1350
01:39:45,704 --> 01:39:48,540
But I did leave you, Uncle
Henry. That's just the trouble.

1351
01:39:48,607 --> 01:39:50,809
And I tried to get
back for days and days.

1352
01:39:50,876 --> 01:39:54,479
There, there, lie quiet now.
You just had a bad dream.

1353
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:55,814
Sure.

1354
01:39:56,181 --> 01:39:59,084
Remember me, your old pal, Hunk?

1355
01:40:00,385 --> 01:40:02,421
And me, Hickory?

1356
01:40:03,055 --> 01:40:05,090
You couldn't forget
my face, could you?

1357
01:40:05,157 --> 01:40:08,460
No. But it wasn't a
dream. It was a place.

1358
01:40:08,961 --> 01:40:12,564
And you, and you, and
you, and you were there.

1359
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:16,902
But you couldn't
have been, could you?

1360
01:40:16,969 --> 01:40:19,104
We dream lots of
silly things when we-

1361
01:40:19,171 --> 01:40:22,641
No, Aunt Em, this was a
real, truly live place.

1362
01:40:23,408 --> 01:40:26,311
And I remember that some
of it wasn't very nice...

1363
01:40:26,378 --> 01:40:29,514
...but most of it was
beautiful. But just the same...

1364
01:40:29,648 --> 01:40:32,818
...all I kept saying to everybody
was, "I want to go home! "

1365
01:40:32,884 --> 01:40:34,753
And they sent me home.

1366
01:40:36,722 --> 01:40:38,757
Doesn't anybody believe me?

1367
01:40:38,857 --> 01:40:40,826
Of course we
believe you, Dorothy.

1368
01:40:40,893 --> 01:40:43,128
But anyway, Toto, we're home!

1369
01:40:43,462 --> 01:40:44,463
Home!

1370
01:40:44,830 --> 01:40:47,933
And this is my room,
and you're all here!

1371
01:40:48,467 --> 01:40:53,138
And I'm not going to leave here ever,
ever again, because I love you all!

1372
01:40:55,407 --> 01:40:59,144
Auntie Em, there's
no place like home!
