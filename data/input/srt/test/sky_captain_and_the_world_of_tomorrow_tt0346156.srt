2
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,600
<i>Attention. Please prepare</i>
<i>for docking procedure.</i>

3
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,500
<i>There's a package for you,</i>
<i>Miss Perkins.</i>

4
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,400
They didn't leave a name.

5
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,400
- Said it was important.
- Thank you.

6
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,500
I don't like this business
you're getting yourself into.

7
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,300
I'll be just fine, Mr. Paley.
You know what a careful girl I am.

8
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,300
I move my mouth, words come out,
you don't hear.

9
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,900
- I'm late for a movie.
- I don't like it when you smile at me.

10
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,600
You don't like my smile?

11
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't like what's behind it.

12
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,000
Listen, Polly, six scientists are missing,
probably dead.

13
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,900
Somebody out there means business.
I don't want you in the middle of it.

14
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,200
It's only a movie, Mr. Paley.

15
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,900
I'll bring you some popcorn.

16
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,700
<i>Toto, I have a feeling</i>
<i>we're not in Kansas anymore.</i>

17
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,500
<i>We must be over the rainbow.</i>

18
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,300
You sent me this?

19
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,800
Who are you?

20
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,900
- What's this all about, Mr...?
- Doctor.

21
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,900
Dr. Walter Jennings.
I'm a research chemist.

22
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,200
I specialize in nucleic-acid emissions.

23
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,400
The bonding enzymes
in proteus molecules which--

24
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,100
The missing scientists.
You said you knew who was next.

25
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Yes, I--

26
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,700
I have a deadline to meet, doctor.

27
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I was one of seven scientists
chosen to serve in a secret facility

28
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,100
stationed outside of Berlin
before the start of the First World War.

29
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,700
It was known only as <i>Einheit Elf</i>,
"Unit 11."

30
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,100
We agreed never to discuss
what went on behind those doors.

31
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,200
The things we were made
to do there...

32
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,400
Terrible things.

33
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,600
- I shouldn't have come.
- <i>Now I know we're not in Kansas.</i>

34
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,100
<i>Are you a good witch</i>
<i>or a bad witch?</i>

35
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,100
Doctor, you said you knew
who was next.

36
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,900
Yes.

37
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,700
Don't you see?

38
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,600
- There is only one left.
- Who? Who is it, doctor?

39
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,300
Me.

40
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,100
He's coming for me.

41
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,900
Who? Who's coming?

42
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,200
Totenkopf.

43
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,600
It's Totenkopf.

44
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,200
There!

45
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,700
<i>All citizens, attention.</i>

46
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,700
<i>New York City</i>
<i>must be evacuated at once.</i>

47
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,000
<i>Proceed in an orderly manner</i>
<i>to the East River Drive.</i>

48
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,900
<i>All members of the police and fire</i>
<i>department on leave or off duty</i>

49
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,400
<i>shall report immediately to their</i>
<i>precincts or company command.</i>

50
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,000
<i>This is urgent.</i>

51
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,000
- Editor Paley.
- <i>Mr. Paley, it's me, Polly.</i>

52
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,300
What's going on? They're calling
for midtown to evacuate.

53
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,100
<i>Listen, Mr. Paley,</i>
<i>I don't have much time.</i>

54
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,000
I need you to dig up anything you can
on a Dr. Walter Jennings

55
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,400
and someone named Totenkopf.

56
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,400
An address, a phone number,
anything you can find. It's important.

57
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,400
Totenkopf. Who is he?

58
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,300
<i>He may have something to do</i>
<i>with the missing scientists.</i>

59
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,000
Quick as you can.

60
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,300
Polly, listen to me.
I want you to get out of there.

61
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,600
I want you to put the phone down,
close your notepad

62
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,000
and get the hell out of there.

63
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,700
Wait a minute.

64
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,700
I can see something now coming
into sight above the Palisades.

65
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,500
They're crossing Sixth Avenue.

66
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,700
Fifth Avenue.

67
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,100
They're a hundred--
They're a hundred yards away.

68
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,300
Polly. Polly!

69
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,900
Oh, my God.

70
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,300
Polly!

71
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Polly!

72
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,400
<i>Polly!</i>

73
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,500
Stop! Come back!

74
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,000
Fire!

75
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,700
Get out of here!

76
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,700
They've broken through the perimeter.
Send reinforcements.

77
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,700
Send everything you've got!

78
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,500
Emergency protocol 90206. Calling
Sky Captain. Come in, Sky Captain.

79
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,000
<i>Repeat. Calling Sky Captain.</i>
<i>Come in, Sky Captain.</i>

80
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,300
<i>This is an emergency</i>
<i>protocol, 90206.</i>

81
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,900
<i>Calling Sky Captain.</i>
<i>Sky Captain, do you read?</i>

82
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,500
<i>Calling Sky Captain.</i>
<i>Come in, Sky Captain.</i>

83
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,300
<i>This is an emergency</i>
<i>protocol, 90206.</i>

84
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,600
<i>Calling Sky Captain.</i>
<i>Sky Captain, do you read?</i>

85
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,800
<i>Repeat. Calling Sky Captain.</i>
<i>Come in, Sky Captain.</i>

86
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,200
This is Sky Captain. I'm on my way.

87
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,300
Polly.

88
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,900
Joe.

89
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,700
<i>Further details of the attack</i>
<i>continue to pour in.</i>

90
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,900
<i>The central portion of the city is</i>
<i>blacked out from radio communication</i>

91
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,600
<i>due to damaged power lines</i>
<i>and electrical failure.</i>

92
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,600
<i>Cables received from English, French</i>
<i>and German news agencies</i>

93
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,800
<i>now confirm the attack</i>
<i>was not limited to the city.</i>

94
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,100
<i>The BBC is reporting</i>
<i>that a steel mill in Nuremberg</i>

95
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,600
<i>was virtually excavated</i>

96
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,300
<i>by what witnesses describe</i>
<i>as a mechanized tornado.</i>

97
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,500
<i>News agencies in Paris and Madrid</i>
<i>speak of strange burrowing machines</i>

98
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,800
<i>rising from the ground,</i>

99
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,800
<i>robbing entire communities</i>
<i>of their coal and oil reserves.</i>

100
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,900
<i>Meanwhile, with military resources</i>
<i>stretched thin across the globe,</i>

101
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
<i>world leaders</i>
<i>must once again call upon</i>

102
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,000
<i>the elite mercenary forces</i>
<i>of Sky Captain and his army-for-hire</i>

103
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,400
<i>to uncover the meaning</i>
<i>of these mysterious events.</i>

104
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Where's Dex?

105
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,600
Shazam.

106
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,800
I thought you said this thing was big.
Can I have it?

107
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,900
You find out where it came from,
and I'll buy you one for Christmas.

108
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Oh, I need to show you something.

109
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,400
I recorded this signal just before
the first machine appeared.

110
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,500
I didn't think anything of it
until I played it back.

111
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,500
- Morse code?
- See, that's what I thought at first,

112
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,400
but the syntax
is more complex than that.

113
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,000
There's a sub-carrier hidden
in the lower frequency.

114
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,100
I think it's being used
to control them.

115
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,900
If it shows up again,
could you track it?

116
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,600
I can try, yeah.

117
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,100
- Good boy, Dex.
- Thanks.

118
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,800
In the meantime,
see what you can do with that thing.

119
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,200
Find out what makes it tick.

120
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,000
- You don't mind, do you?
- I don't mind.

121
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,200
I wanna know where it comes from,
Dex. Who sent it here.

122
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:41,600
<i>Switch to map coordinate</i>
<i>69 SW by 49 E.</i>

123
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,300
Tummy ache?

124
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,600
How you been, Joe?

125
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,700
- Miss me?
- Get out.

126
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,100
Well, it's nice to see you too.

127
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,700
Dex said you might be in a mood.

128
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,200
Dex?

129
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,600
Get in here!

130
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,900
It's been three years, Joe.
You're not still mad at me, are you?

131
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,700
Can't even remember
what we were fighting about.

132
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,400
You sabotaged my plane.

133
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,200
Right.

134
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,800
I spent six months in a Manchurian
slave camp because of you.

135
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,600
- They were gonna cut off my fingers.
- Joe,

136
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,400
for the last time, I didn't sabotage
your damn airplane.

137
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,600
All so you could get a photograph
of Tojo Hideki

138
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,200
in his bathrobe, remember?

139
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,700
You know, I'm starting to think

140
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,800
that you've invented
this whole sabotage nonsense

141
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,100
to cover the fact that
you were running around on me

142
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,700
with your little mystery girl
the whole time we were in Nanjing.

143
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,000
Never happened.
All in your imagination.

144
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,100
Who was she, Joe?

145
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,800
- What was her name?
- That's enough.

146
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,400
What are you gonna do?

147
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,200
Shoot me?

148
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,500
Oh, great. We all made up.

149
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,900
It's been a pleasure, Polly.

150
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Let's do it again in ten years.
Escort Miss Perkins off the base, Dex.

151
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,900
If she resists, shoot her.

152
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,300
- Hi, Polly.
- Hi, Dex.

153
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,600
- I gotta...
- It's okay, hon, I know.

154
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,200
Okay.

155
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,700
It's just as well. I guess you wouldn't
have been interested in this, anyway.

156
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,100
- Where did you get that?
- There's more where this came from.

157
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,000
Lots more.

158
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,000
- I want that blueprint, Polly.
- I want this story, Joe.

159
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,400
And you're gonna help me get it.

160
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,300
Maybe we should show her, Cap.
Maybe she can help.

161
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,200
Show me what?

162
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,500
Show me what?

163
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,500
My God. What is this?

164
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,300
Where do they come from?

165
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,800
They started appearing three years ago
in remote areas.

166
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,500
We managed to keep it a secret
until now.

167
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,100
They show up without warning,
they take what they need,

168
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,700
and then they disappear
without a trace.

169
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,900
Three years and we still can't explain
what they want

170
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,400
or who's sending them here.

171
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,200
A man came to see me today,
a scientist.

172
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,500
He was terrified.
Said someone was coming for him.

173
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,800
I asked him who he was so afraid of,
and he repeated one name:

174
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,400
Totenkopf.

175
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,400
He nearly went white
when he said it.

176
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,700
Totenkopf, who is he?

177
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,200
He's the invisible man.

178
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,900
I've been through every library record
twice looking for anything.

179
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,300
I've called every contact I have
from Paris to Bangkok.

180
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,000
This is the only thing I could dig up.

181
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,200
He ran some kind of secret
science unit outside of Berlin

182
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,000
before the start of World War I.

183
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,300
Something called Unit 11.

184
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,500
It's been more than 30 years
since anyone has spoken his name.

185
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,700
Until today.

186
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,700
Note the insignia he used
for the unit.

187
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,100
It matches the markings
on all of these machines.

188
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,200
The scientist, where is he now?

189
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,800
We're in this together, right, Joe?

190
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,800
Nothing gets published until I say so.
You don't write a sentence

191
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,600
or take a photograph without
asking me first. Understood?

192
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,000
Understood.

193
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,100
What?

194
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
I missed you.

195
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,900
Thanks for saving my life today,
by the way.

196
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,400
Were you down there?

197
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,400
You missed me too. How nice.

198
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,600
This is it. This is Jennings' lab.

199
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,800
Dr. Jennings? It's Polly Perkins.

200
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,400
Dr. Jennings!

201
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,200
It's locked.

202
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,000
That window there.

203
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,900
I may be able to get in
through that window

204
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
if I can attach a line...

205
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,400
It's open.

206
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,500
We're too late.
Someone beat us here.

207
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,500
All right, Polly...

208
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,300
...no more games.
What the hell is going on?

209
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,100
I was hoping you could tell me.

210
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,400
Dr. Jennings!

211
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,400
You must stop him!

212
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,200
Stay here.

213
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,600
Stop!

214
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,000
I don't wanna hurt you.

215
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,200
- Miss Perkins.
- I'm here, doctor.

216
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,800
- I'm going to get you some help.
- You must promise.

217
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,500
If Totenkopf finds them,
the countdown will begin.

218
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,200
- This world shall end.
- I don't understand, doctor. Find what?

219
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,200
Promise.

220
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,900
He's dead.

221
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,000
I think I found something.

222
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,600
Dr. Jennings had this with him
this morning at the theater.

223
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,700
- I'd better get back to the base.
- I'm coming with you.

224
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,300
Of course you are.

225
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,700
Reconnaissance picked up something
on radar traveling at over 500 knots

226
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,000
and coming straight for us.

227
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,200
- How long before they reach us?
- There!

228
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
Get my plane ready. I'm going up.

229
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,800
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming with you.

230
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,700
Don't be stupid. Remember what
happened last time you flew with me?

231
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,700
- We had a deal.
- This is not a game, Polly.

232
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,000
- People are gonna die.
- You are not leaving me, Joe.

233
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,400
Not this time. This is my story,
and we had a deal!

234
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,500
Go, go, go!

235
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,000
Get in.

236
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,400
There you are.

237
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,200
- Cap, this is Dex, do you read me?
- Hang on, Dex, I'm a little busy.

238
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,200
Come in, Dex.

239
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,600
Look, whatever you do, don't shoot!

240
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,200
- Okay.
- You shot it, didn't you?

241
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,100
- Yes.
- <i>Listen, Cap,</i>

242
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,500
the signal's coming
from one of those machines.

243
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,900
You gotta keep them
in one piece.

244
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,400
Which machine is it, Dex?

245
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,400
<i>There's no way of telling.</i>
<i>It could be any one of them.</i>

246
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,200
I think I found it, Dex.

247
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,400
- Wait, Cap, I'm losing the signal.
- It's heading for the city.

248
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,000
Don't let it get away. I need you
to bounce that signal back to me.

249
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,600
If we lose it now,
we may never get it back.

250
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,900
You let me know when
you've got something, Dex.

251
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,300
<i>I'll let you know. Out.</i>

252
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,900
All right, I want a full-spectrum sweep
of every incoming signal.

253
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,500
Amplify any variant frequency cycle
and route them to me.

254
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,500
They've come back
for the generators.

255
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,600
Who is this guy?

256
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,300
- You okay?
- Great.

257
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,000
There's a bottle of Milk of Magnesia
under the seat if you need it.

258
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,400
- I'm fine.
- You don't look so good.

259
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,600
Pull up!

260
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,800
- Joe!
- I see it!

261
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
It's getting away.

262
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,700
- I lost the signal, Cap.
- I'll find him, Dex. Sit tight.

263
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,100
- Go left.
- Sit back, Polly.

264
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,500
There's a shortcut down Broadway.
You can catch him on 42nd Street.

265
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,900
I know these streets like the back
of my hand. Go left!

266
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,500
Hey!

267
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,800
Okay, okay, now go straight.

268
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,000
- No, no, no, go right!
- When?

269
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,200
Back there.

270
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,800
I could use a little more warning
next time.

271
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,900
Go left!

272
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,700
Tell me you got something, Dex.

273
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,600
<i>We're getting clobbered up here.</i>

274
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,300
It's no picnic down here either, Cap.
Hang in there, I've almost got it.

275
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,400
Joe!

276
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,500
Dex! We can't hold them off
any longer!

277
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,300
- I'm almost there.
- We have to evacuate now!

278
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,500
Go ahead without me.
I'm right behind you.

279
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,900
- Lovely.
- Okay, turn left at the drugstore.

280
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,100
- Left again.
- We're going around in circles.

281
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,400
Will you just trust me? Go left!

282
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,900
- It's a dead end.
- That's not supposed to be there.

283
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
It's a dead end!

284
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,500
There's no way out!

285
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Oh, bugger.

286
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,400
Joe!

287
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,100
- There's the lead ship.
- Shortcut!

288
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,900
I got us here, didn't I?

289
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,900
- Dex. Dex!
- Thirty seconds, Cap, that's all I need.

290
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,800
- Thirty seconds.
- Plus or minus.

291
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,900
Listen, I'll try and take them out over
the water, buy us some time. Over.

292
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,500
Still glad you came?

293
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,200
Joe, I found it! Joe!

294
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,600
<i>Dex, come in. Where is it?</i>

295
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,900
<i>Come in, Dex. Are you there? Dex?</i>

296
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,300
<i>Dex, do you read me?</i>

297
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,900
<i>Dex, are you there?</i>

298
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,500
I can't outrun them much longer.

299
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,700
Hold on.

300
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,900
Joe, what are you doing?
You're heading straight down!

301
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,500
- You're gonna kill us!
- I know what I'm doing. Just hold on.

302
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,400
We're going too fast.
We're not gonna make it.

303
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,000
Joe, you have to pull up!

304
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,800
Pull up!

305
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,800
- We went underwater.
- Dex rigged it up.

306
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,700
Got the idea from one
of his comic books.

307
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,300
You mean, you knew this
the whole time,

308
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,100
and you let me think
we were gonna crash?

309
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,000
I thought we were gonna die!
You should have said something!

310
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,300
Look, Polly, it was your idea
to tag along, not mine.

311
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,300
If you can't take it,
that's not my fault.

312
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,700
Oh, I can take it.

313
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,700
- I can take anything you dish out.
- Good.

314
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,100
Because that was nothing.

315
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,400
Dex, come in. Do you read me?

316
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,400
Do you read me, Dex? Copy.

317
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,800
Dex!

318
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,200
Dex!

319
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,300
Dex.

320
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,700
They're everywhere.

321
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,400
Joe, look out!

322
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,800
Dex!

323
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,100
Why would Totenkopf do this?

324
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,500
Why Dex?
It doesn't make any sense.

325
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,500
He was looking for something.

326
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,100
Dex said he knew where
the transmission was coming from.

327
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,000
He must have got too close.

328
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,500
- He was trying to tell me something--
- Joe.

329
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,500
Good boy, Dex.

330
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,400
These journals belong to Dr. Vargas.

331
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,400
He must have passed them on to
Dr. Jennings before his disappearance.

332
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,900
- My God.
- What?

333
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,500
"Totenkopf was awarded his first
patent when he was 12 years old.

334
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,000
By 17, he had already received
two doctorates

335
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,300
and was one of the most highly
regarded minds of his day.

336
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,400
One year after his disappearance,
ominous rumors began circulating.

337
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,400
Whispers that Totenkopf
had begun work

338
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,900
on what was darkly hinted
to be a doomsday device.

339
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,300
Efforts to locate him
have consistently failed,

340
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,000
and to this day, his whereabouts
remain a mystery.

341
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,500
Even less is known
about his companion,

342
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,800
an assassin who controls
his machines."

343
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,400
She's the one who took Dex.

344
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
What else?

345
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,900
These are Unit 11 supply logs.

346
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
This is everything he's used
his machines to collect

347
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,600
for the last three years,
including generators from the city.

348
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,600
It reads like a shopping list
from all over the world.

349
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,800
What have you been up to, doctor?

350
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,500
It'll be all right, Joe.
Dex can look after himself.

351
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,300
We'll find him.

352
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,900
My old friend Joe.

353
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:14,800
- So glad to see you again.
- It's good to see you too, Kaji.

354
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,100
- So glad to see you again.
- It's good to see you too, Kaji.

355
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,800
This is Polly Perkins.
She'll be coming with us.

356
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,600
Nice to meet you.

357
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,800
- Kaji, did you get the maps I needed?
- Yeah, they're inside.

358
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,700
Did you get a little something
for me?

359
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,000
Of course. Three cases,
just like you asked.

360
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,800
Vienna sausages.
My God, it's been so long.

361
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,900
Kaji, how's your Tibetan?

362
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,400
Come, I'll show you the maps.

363
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,400
- How well do you know him?
- Kaji?

364
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:02,400
He's old legion.
Reconnaissance. Why?

365
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,000
I don't trust him.

366
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,900
That's funny, he said
the same thing about you.

367
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Here. Get changed.
Your clothes stay behind.

368
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,900
You won't be needing high heels
where we're going.

369
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:27,500
Dex tracked the signal to here,
this valley north of Karakal.

370
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,000
This is where
the transmission originated.

371
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,600
Why is there no writing here?
What is this place?

372
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,500
- Shambhala.
- You know it?

373
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,200
It is forbidden.

374
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:42,000
It's said to be the source
of the Kalachakra, Tibetan magic.

375
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,700
Those who live there are said
to have supernatural powers.

376
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,600
You can get us there, Kaji,
can't you?

377
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,900
No one has ventured this far.
It's very dangerous.

378
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,500
Shambhala is said to be protected by
the priests of the Kalachakra lamasery.

379
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,300
If they find us there,
they will kill us.

380
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,700
Why? Why is this place so special?

381
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,600
Shambhala is known by many names.
To the Hebrew, it is Eden.

382
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,500
To the ancient Greek,
it was Empurios.

383
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,700
You may know it as Shangri-la.

384
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:19,200
A storm is coming. If you still wish
to go, we must go now.

385
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,900
I need to send a message.

386
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,700
<i>Editor Paley, this may be the last</i>
<i>message you receive from me.</i>

387
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:34,600
<i>We've tracked a radio signal to Nepal</i>
<i>in search of Dr. Totenkopf.</i>

388
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,400
<i>The story grows stranger</i>
<i>at every turn.</i>

389
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,700
<i>Clues about a countdown.</i>
<i>But to what, I don't know.</i>

390
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,300
<i>I fear time is running out.</i>

391
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,900
<i>With any luck, I'll be back soon</i>
<i>with Dex and the story.</i>

392
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,400
<i>I hope. Polly Perkins.</i>

393
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,100
This is where civilization stops.

394
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,100
A blank on the map.

395
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,700
We must be careful from here.

396
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,900
Hurry.

397
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,700
What is it?

398
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,200
It looks like a mining outpost.

399
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,900
Something bad happened here.

400
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,700
Seems to be abandoned.

401
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,000
Tell your men we're heading down.

402
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,800
I want a closer look.

403
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,900
What is it, Joe?

404
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,200
Uranium.

405
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,100
The whole mine's contaminated.

406
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,900
- We can't stay here.
- Let's go.

407
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,400
Where's Polly?

408
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,600
Polly!

409
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,800
Miss Perkins?

410
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,000
We'll have to split up.

411
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,200
Polly!

412
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,000
Let her go.

413
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,900
Give me the vials
and the girl will live.

414
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,500
What vials?
What are you talking about?

415
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,200
I will not ask a second time.

416
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,600
Drop the gun.

417
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,100
I told you, I don't know what you're
talking about. You'll just have to kill us.

418
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,400
As you wish.

419
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,300
Wait! Wait. Wait.

420
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,900
I'm sorry, Joe.

421
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,300
Goodbye, my friends.
Your journey ends here.

422
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,800
I was going to tell you, Joe.
You have to believe me.

423
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,400
- What was in those vials?
- I don't know.

424
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,800
- You expect me to believe that?
- I'm telling the truth, Joe.

425
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,200
Dr. Jennings gave them to me
just before he died.

426
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,100
He said that the world would end
and the countdown would begin

427
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,000
if Totenkopf got his hands on them.

428
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,400
You've done nothing but lie to me
from the beginning.

429
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:50,500
Okay, I'm a liar. But I don't exaggerate.
That is what he said.

430
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:54,000
That was what Totenkopf
was looking for.

431
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,500
- That's why he took Dex.
- I'm sorry.

432
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,100
I never meant for any of this
to happen.

433
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,600
Do you hear that?

434
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,700
Dynamite.

435
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,100
That noise again.

436
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,700
Move!

437
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,900
What are you doing?

438
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,500
Come on!

439
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,700
Oh, great.

440
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,500
We're safe.

441
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,700
Polly, this may be
our last moment together.

442
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,700
There's something
I need to ask you.

443
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,000
Yes, Joe?

444
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,800
Did you cut my fuel line?

445
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:13,300
Damn it! I didn't sabotage
your lousy airplane!

446
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,300
Our last moments on earth
and this is all you have to say to me?

447
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,600
Could we just for once die
without all this bickering?

448
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,000
There you are.

449
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,600
- Why did you lock the door?
- Run!

450
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,800
My film.

451
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,200
Polly, leave it!
There's no time!

452
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,700
Polly.

453
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,100
Polly.

454
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,600
My clothes.

455
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,400
What are you doing in here?
Get out. Get out!

456
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,200
Not unless you have some pants
hidden under there for me.

457
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:42,300
- Oh, don't tell me you're--
- Naked.

458
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,700
- You can say it, Polly.
- This isn't funny, Joe.

459
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:51,700
Where are we? What happened to us?
Where are our clothes?

460
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,500
Stop looking at me like that.

461
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,100
Like what?

462
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,800
Turn around, Joe.

463
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,800
I'm serious. Turn around.

464
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,900
Hi, Joe.

465
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,100
Ask him what he did
with our clothes.

466
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,400
The clothes are burned.

467
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,400
Burned? Why?

468
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,500
He says the mine is poisonous.

469
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,700
Our clothes were infected.

470
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,300
He says he's arranged for a guide
to lead us back down the mountain.

471
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,900
He will take us there
once we are dressed.

472
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,200
We appreciate that. But explain to him
we are here to find a man.

473
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,600
He says we must leave
before it is dark.

474
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,200
There's nothing more
he can do for us.

475
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,500
It's very important we find this man.

476
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,300
His name is Totenkopf!

477
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,100
He says, what do you want
with this man?

478
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,100
I've come to kill him.

479
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,900
And to find my friend.

480
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,500
He says he will help you.

481
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,700
What do you think?

482
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,700
I think they burned
the wrong clothes.

483
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,100
You said I couldn't bring
anything else.

484
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,100
I think you look like
a woolly mammoth.

485
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,400
They're waiting for us.

486
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,300
The priest says that Totenkopf
enslaved his people,

487
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,400
made them work in the mine,
but the mine was poisonous.

488
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,400
Those who did not die right away
were brought here for him to study.

489
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,500
Where is Totenkopf now?

490
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,600
He does not know. Only that
Totenkopf is gone, many years ago.

491
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,200
I can't believe this is happening.

492
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,700
I only have two shots left.

493
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,700
We're in Shangri-la
and all I have is two shots.

494
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,100
Everything I had was in that bag.

495
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,700
You should have let me go back
for my film.

496
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,200
You're right, I should have.

497
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,000
So where's he taking us?

498
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:45,700
To meet the only living survivor
of Totenkopf's experiments.

499
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,400
What experiments?

500
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,500
Ask him, where is Totenkopf?
Tell him it's important we find him.

501
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,600
He wants to know why.
Why do you seek Totenkopf?

502
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,700
To make him pay
for what he has done.

503
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,000
His staff. He's asking for his staff.

504
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:34,300
He says, follow Rana. The staff
will lead you there to Totenkopf.

505
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,900
Rana? Is there such a place?

506
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:46,500
He says now that he has helped you,
you must help him.

507
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,300
Of course. Anything.

508
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,300
What do you want?

509
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,500
Kill me.

510
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,600
Have you looked at this?
There's markings on it, like a ruler.

511
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,600
And there's a moon and a star.

512
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:26,700
<i>And all I ask is a tall ship</i>

513
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,700
<i>and a star to steer her by</i>

514
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,400
A star.

515
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,700
He wasn't talking about a place,
he was talking about a star!

516
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,800
Rana is a star.

517
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:43,100
Ancient sailors used to navigate
by using the night sky.

518
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:46,900
They could determine their position
by the moon and the stars.

519
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,300
The Vikings were known
to create maps for certain stars,

520
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,000
The Vikings were known
to create maps for certain stars,

521
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:53,900
latitude tables that required a key
to decipher them.

522
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,500
The key was called Jacob's staff.
This has to be the key!

523
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,000
You mean this could really work?

524
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,900
You could really find Totenkopf
with this thing?

525
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
We do things a little
different nowadays.

526
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:08,100
All we needed to know was where
to look. What's the date?

527
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,900
- March 2.
- March 2.

528
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,100
Using Karakal Plateau
as our assumed position...

529
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,800
March 2...

530
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,100
Rana is at latitude 20.40.

531
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:30,500
Right ascension, 03 hours,
43 minutes.

532
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:35,400
Declination, minus 10.60.

533
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,400
There's nothing there.

534
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,700
Are you sure you did it right?

535
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,500
I'm sure.

536
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:50,000
If the old man was right,
that's where Totenkopf is now.

537
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,200
Dead center in the middle
of nowhere.

538
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,900
What's that point there?

539
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,800
That's where we run out of fuel.

540
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,600
Oh, great.

541
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,900
So how do we get there?

542
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,100
- Franky.
- Who?

543
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,500
Frank Cook. An old buddy of mine.

544
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,900
Runs a mobile reconnaissance outpost
for the Royal Navy.

545
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,200
If I can get a message to them,

546
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:29,100
I may be able to arrange a rendezvous
at these coordinates.

547
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:31,600
And what if they don't
get the message?

548
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,800
Franky's never let me down.
They'll be there.

549
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,000
They'll be there.

550
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,700
Is that light supposed to be on?

551
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,300
Relax, Polly, everything's fine.

552
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:01,900
- We're out of fuel, aren't we?
- Buckle up.

553
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,800
Manta Station, do you read me?

554
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,600
Where are you, Franky?

555
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,800
What are you doing?

556
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,000
You can't land this
in the middle of nowhere.

557
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,700
I'm not. I'm landing it on that.

558
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,800
- What is it?
- It's a mobile airstrip.

559
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,600
Dex had a hand in designing it.

560
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:31,000
It's kind of a secret. You can keep
a secret, can't you, Polly?

561
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,200
Yeah.

562
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:34,800
I can keep a secret.

563
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,400
Two shots.

564
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:47,000
<i>Permission to land on platform 327.</i>
<i>Maintain your present course.</i>

565
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,000
Copy, 327.

566
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,300
<i>Welcome aboard, captain.</i>

567
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:33,100
Joseph Sullivan.
I was sure you'd be dead by now.

568
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,300
It's good to see you too, Franky.

569
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:41,700
This had better be important
or one of us is in trouble.

570
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:42,800
It's important.

571
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,800
What is that?

572
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,900
You be nice.

573
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,700
Commander Cook,
meet Polly Perkins.

574
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:02,300
Polly Perkins.
I've heard so much about you.

575
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,500
It's a pleasure to finally meet
the competition.

576
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:08,700
It's been a long time since Nanjing,
hasn't it, Joseph?

577
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:15,200
So, Franky, I hear you've been having
trouble with that number-three engine,

578
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,100
or at least you were last time--

579
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,600
Commander, we're tracking six
enemy submersibles

580
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,700
bearing 30 degrees northwest.

581
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,300
- Who wants to kill you now?
- <i>Man your battle stations.</i>

582
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,800
- <i>All hands on deck.</i>
- Follow me.

583
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,400
Take us to 10,000 feet
and deploy countermeasures.

584
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,500
Yes, commander.

585
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,100
Reconnaissance located an island

586
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:45,000
3 kilometers northeast
of our current position.

587
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,500
It is not, however,
on any of our charts.

588
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,600
- That has to be him.
- That has to be who?

589
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,900
What have you got me
into this time, Joseph?

590
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,900
Nothing you can't handle, Franky.

591
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:00,400
Polly, try not to touch anything.

592
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:04,800
Enemy warships bearing 316,
mark 4. Closing fast.

593
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:08,000
- Give me a visual.
- Launching radio imager.

594
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,900
We're receiving a signal.
On-screen now.

595
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:29,500
Totenkopf.

596
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,300
Commander, we've lost power to the
forward rotors. We're losing altitude.

597
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,600
All engines, reverse full.
Get us out of here.

598
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,000
Francesca, you've got to get me
on that island.

599
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:44,200
I'm not about to risk the lives
of my men for one of your silly antics.

600
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,300
He's got Dex.

601
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,100
Rescind order!

602
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,500
You'll never make it from the air.
We have to find you another way.

603
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,200
There's a tidal flow on the eastern face
of the island.

604
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:05,600
It's too deep.
We're not rated past 300 meters.

605
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:07,400
But...

606
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,000
...this area here,

607
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:11,800
there's an undersea inlet
at the southern tip

608
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:16,400
and it runs beneath the entire length
of the island. That is your only way in.

609
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,600
Everything else is sheer rock
to the edge of the water.

610
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:21,100
What about those machines?
How do we get past them?

611
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,600
Leave that to me.

612
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,700
Alert the amphibious squadron.

613
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,400
<i>Report to main station carrier.</i>

614
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:10,800
What?

615
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,100
Nanjing?

616
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,400
I can't hear you, Polly.

617
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,100
You'll have to speak up.

618
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,900
<i>Keep your nose up, Joseph. You</i>
<i>always were bad at the short takeoff.</i>

619
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,700
Keep up, Franky. I don't wanna
have to come back for you.

620
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:49,400
I thought your takeoff was just fine.

621
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,800
Thank you, Polly.

622
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,900
So you heard that, did you?

623
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:00,000
<i>Manta leader to Manta team,</i>
<i>impact in ten seconds.</i>

624
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:01,800
Switching to amphibious mode.

625
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:13,600
Impact in five, four, three,

626
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,900
two, one.

627
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Franky.

628
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:45,300
<i>You remember our milk run</i>
<i>over Shanghai, don't you?</i>

629
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:47,800
<i>We had the target buttoned up</i>
<i>and he was jinxing in the flak.</i>

630
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:51,200
- Pops a rivet, thinks he's taken a hit.
- And started yelling:

631
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:52,700
- "Protect the rabbits!"
- <i>"Protect the rabbits!"</i>

632
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,300
- "Protect the rabbits!"
- <i>"Protect the rabbits!"</i>

633
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:10,400
Enemy target spotted four points
to the right. Depth, 1,600. Look sharp.

634
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,400
Joe, watch out!

635
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:07,500
- Joseph, there's the inlet.
- I see it.

636
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:14,000
Get ready to make a run for it.
We're about to clear you a path.

637
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,800
Hold on, now, Polly.
Hold on.

638
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,800
Manta leader to Manta team,

639
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:27,200
arm cluster torpedoes
and stick close to element formation.

640
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,600
Fire.

641
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,400
Joseph! Pull up!

642
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,500
Joseph, it's still alive. Disengage.

643
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,700
Do you hear me? Disengage.

644
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:06,700
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

645
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:09,700
- What is it?
- <i>Do you hear me? Pull up!</i>

646
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:12,500
- The rudder's jammed. I can't steer.
- Joseph!

647
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,600
Disengage!

648
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:35,500
- Thank you, Franky. That was close.
- Get ready to make a run for it.

649
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,000
<i>You're only going to have</i>
<i>one shot at this.</i>

650
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:39,100
Franky, what are you doing?
This is no time to show off.

651
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,200
- She's heading straight for it.
- On my mark.

652
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,100
- She's going to ram it.
- It's suicide.

653
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,100
Franky, pull up.

654
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,400
- Three.
- Pull up, Franky.

655
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,000
Two.

656
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,400
One.

657
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,800
You're all clear.

658
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,200
<i>Good luck, Joe.</i>

659
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,100
Thank you, Franky.
We'll take it from here.

660
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,500
She's some kind of girl.

661
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:16,700
Yes, I know.

662
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,300
I'm taking us up.

663
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,600
What?

664
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:41,700
- What is it?
- One of Totenkopf's creatures.

665
01:10:56,100 --> 01:11:00,100
- You're not gonna photograph that?
- I've only got two shots left.

666
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,400
Who knows what's waiting for us
out there.

667
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,500
Suit yourself.

668
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,200
There's a clearing up ahead.
Totenkopf can't be far.

669
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,400
Run.

670
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,700
There.

671
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:03,100
Polly!

672
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,000
Oh, great.

673
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,000
Come on!

674
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Polly!

675
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:20,400
Come on!

676
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:30,700
Are you mad?

677
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:31,500
Are you mad?

678
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:35,900
Are you completely insane?
You could have gotten yourself killed!

679
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,900
- It's okay.
- No, it isn't.

680
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,300
- I didn't mean--
- I shot the ground!

681
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,200
- What?
- When we were running,

682
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:52,200
I shot the ground.

683
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,300
It isn't funny.

684
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:05,300
I only have one shot left.
One shot!

685
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:14,500
What is it with you
and that stupid camera, anyway?

686
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,500
You gave it to me.

687
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,000
You don't even remember, do you?

688
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:24,800
You were flying with the American
volunteers in Nanjing,

689
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,500
I was covering the evacuation
of Shanghai.

690
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,700
- I remember.
- Joe, I wanna ask you something

691
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:31,200
and I want you to tell me the truth.

692
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:35,200
I don't care one way or the other,
I swear. I just need to know.

693
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,300
The girl in Nanjing was Franky,
wasn't it?

694
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:40,400
- Polly.
- How long were you seeing her?

695
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Look me in the eyes.

696
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,900
I never fooled around on you.

697
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Never.

698
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,700
I sabotaged your plane.

699
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,100
- Three months.
- I knew it!

700
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:59,000
I can't believe I ever trusted you,
you lousy--

701
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,100
He's here.

702
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,100
You all right?

703
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:33,700
Through there.

704
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:41,100
Through there.

705
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,400
My God, Joe.

706
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,300
It's an ark.

707
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,800
He's building an ark.

708
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,100
What are you doing?

709
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,700
You honestly think you're gonna
find something more important

710
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,900
than every single creature on Earth
being led two by two

711
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:07,200
inside a giant rocket ship?

712
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:09,400
I might.

713
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,300
- Like what?
- I'll know when I see it.

714
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:24,600
- <i>Ten minutes to liftoff.</i>
- They've started the countdown.

715
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:27,100
We have to find Totenkopf.

716
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,000
You've got a gift.

717
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,000
- Dex!
- Hurry, get in!

718
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:09,800
<i>Einsteigen. Komm, springt!</i>

719
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:18,500
Are you all right?
How did you find us?

720
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,800
We escaped into the tunnels
once the countdown started.

721
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:23,500
Some of the scientists were caught.
They didn't make it.

722
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,500
The machines that were guarding us

723
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,500
are loading everything on this island
into that ship.

724
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,900
We've got about ten minutes
to stop that thing from blasting off.

725
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,800
Dex! Get us out of here!

726
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,400
Good boy, Dex.

727
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,400
Thanks, Cap.

728
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,600
- Who are they?
- They're Unit 11.

729
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:09,800
Or what's left of them.

730
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
They were brought here to finish
what they started 30 years ago.

731
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,300
Finish what?

732
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:15,600
Tell them.

733
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:18,800
Totenkopf believed that humankind
was doomed to extinction,

734
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:20,500
so he proposed the unthinkable:

735
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:24,000
To build a vessel that would carry
the building blocks of a new civilization

736
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,100
into space.

737
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,200
He used his machines
to collect specimens

738
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:29,000
representing all life on Earth.

739
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,800
What Totenkopf called
"The World of Tomorrow."

740
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:33,700
Those vials that Dr. Jennings
gave me, what were they?

741
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,100
Adam and Eve.
Totenkopf's masterpiece.

742
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,500
Seeds of a technological utopia.

743
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,000
We smuggled them off this island,

744
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:41,900
knowing Totenkopf
would never leave without them.

745
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,500
But now that he has them again,
there is nothing left to keep him here.

746
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,300
Then let him go. Let him go
where he can't harm anyone.

747
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:51,000
No, no, no, that ship
must never leave this Earth.

748
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:53,000
Why? What haven't you told us?

749
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:56,300
When the rocket reaches 100
kilometers, at the edge of space,

750
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:59,100
- Earth will be incinerated.
- How do we stop it?

751
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:02,000
Only Totenkopf can stop it now. But
we've never been allowed near him.

752
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,100
He's too well guarded
even to be seen.

753
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:06,900
- Where is he?
- We're on our way, Cap.

754
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,200
Good boy, Dex.

755
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:14,300
Careful. Careful.

756
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:19,100
Hurry, they'll be coming for us.

757
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:25,900
Through there.
That's the only way in.

758
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,300
You see, there is no way past them.

759
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:31,700
Five minutes, Joe.

760
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,500
- Wait here.
- You'll be killed.

761
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,000
He knows what he's doing.

762
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:40,600
I think.

763
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:46,200
Hey, that's my gun!

764
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:52,700
- Dex?
- Try shaking it.

765
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:03,800
- We must hurry.
- Don't do it, you idiot!

766
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,100
Doctor, stop!

767
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:24,200
<i>Who dares come before me?</i>

768
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:26,600
<i>Who dares enter this place?</i>

769
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:29,900
<i>What has begun</i>
<i>cannot be stopped.</i>

770
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,400
- <i>The time for this world is over.</i>
- Totenkopf.

771
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,600
Hello, doctor.

772
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:36,300
Why are you doing this?

773
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:39,400
<i>I have been witness to a world</i>
<i>consumed by hatred</i>

774
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,800
<i>and bent on self-destruction.</i>

775
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:45,200
<i>Watched as we have taken</i>
<i>what was to be a paradise</i>

776
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:48,500
<i>and failed in our responsibilities</i>
<i>as its steward.</i>

777
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:51,800
<i>I know now that the course</i>
<i>the human race has set for itself</i>

778
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:53,900
<i>cannot be changed.</i>

779
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:58,300
<i>I am the last, desperate chance</i>
<i>for a doomed planet.</i>

780
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:01,000
<i>Now, leave this place or die!</i>

781
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,700
- Is it safe?
- Well, there's only one way to find out.

782
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:22,100
I meant throw something.

783
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:44,600
He's not here.

784
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,500
We're too late.

785
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,300
These are his personal papers.

786
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:51,900
He would never leave without them.
He must still be here.

787
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,700
- We must find him.
- I found him.

788
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:10,100
It's impossible.

789
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,500
It can't be.

790
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:16,100
The last entry in his journal
was made on October 11, 1918.

791
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:17,700
He died over 20 years ago.

792
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:26,100
We've been chasing a ghost.

793
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:40,600
<i>Three minutes to liftoff.</i>

794
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:48,800
They never stopped. They're finishing
what they were programmed to do.

795
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:54,300
Don't you see? This entire island
is Totenkopf. Every wire, every gear.

796
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:57,200
He's found a way to cheat
even his own death.

797
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:00,300
So how do we kill somebody
who's already dead?

798
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,900
- How do I stop it?
- Nothing can stop it now.

799
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,400
- There must be some way.
- His machines would never allow it.

800
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:08,800
Leave the machines to me.
Dex, show me what to do.

801
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,200
If you can cut the lead
in the system terminal,

802
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:16,600
it should create a short...

803
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:21,200
...which will ignite the fuel line
before the booster engines can fire

804
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:23,100
- and destroy the atmosphere.
- That's it?

805
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:27,800
- That's all I have to do?
- The terminal's onboard the rocket.

806
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:30,200
You won't have time to escape.

807
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,500
Contact Franky as soon
as you're off the island.

808
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:38,300
- She'll know exactly what to do.
- What are you talking about?

809
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:41,000
- I'm going with you.
- Not this time.

810
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:43,100
We had a deal.

811
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,700
You're not gonna leave me now,
just when things are getting interesting.

812
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:53,100
- I won't let you.
- I wish we had more time.

813
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:56,400
And I only hope, one day,
you can forgive me.

814
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,300
- Take care of her, Dex.
- Good luck, Cap.

815
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,800
<i>One minute to liftoff.</i>

816
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:32,600
We meet again,
my mysterious friend.

817
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:36,800
How do you wanna do this?

818
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:43,900
Nice shot, Polly.

819
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:56,000
What took you so long?

820
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,300
She's a machine.

821
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:10,800
<i>Ten seconds to liftoff.</i>

822
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,500
<i>Nine...</i>

823
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:13,900
<i>...eight...</i>

824
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:15,600
<i>...seven...</i>

825
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:17,000
<i>...six...</i>

826
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:18,400
<i>...five...</i>

827
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,200
<i>...four...</i>

828
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,100
We've gotta get those animals
off the ship.

829
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,400
<i>Ninety kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

830
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:12,800
There's no time.

831
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,600
That's our only way across.

832
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:25,500
<i>Eighty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

833
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:37,800
<i>Danger! Danger! Danger!</i>
<i>Cargo release imminent!</i>

834
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:39,900
What did you do now?

835
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:44,800
Come on!

836
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,600
<i>Seventy kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

837
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:01,700
<i>Sixty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

838
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,400
Hold on!

839
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,600
Please! Don't touch anything else!

840
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,700
There's no time. We'll never make it.

841
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:30,400
<i>Fifty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

842
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:38,800
Run!

843
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,600
<i>Forty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

844
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:52,200
Come in, Manta station.
Do you read me?

845
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:57,400
<i>Thirty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

846
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:03,500
Franky, it's Dex. Do you read me?

847
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:13,200
It didn't work.

848
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,600
<i>Twenty kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

849
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:22,300
Joe, you're running out of time.
You've gotta do something.

850
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:27,600
<i>And God saw that the wickedness</i>
<i>of man was great in the earth...</i>

851
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:30,600
- He thinks he's God.
- <i>And God said unto Noah, the end...</i>

852
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:31,900
Shut up!

853
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:34,700
<i>Ten kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

854
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:36,100
<i>Nine...</i>

855
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,400
<i>...eight...</i>

856
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:39,600
<i>...seven...</i>

857
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,500
- <i>...six...</i>
- Why won't you die?

858
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:44,800
<i>Five kilometers to booster ignition.</i>

859
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:47,900
<i>Four...</i>

860
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:49,500

01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:51,900
<i>...two...</i>

862
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,300
<i>...one.</i>

863
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:00,800
<i>Warning. System failure.</i>

864
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,700
<i>Booster malfunction.</i>

01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:04,900
<i>Danger. Danger.</i>

866
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,200
<i>Danger.</i>

867
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:08,800
<i>Warning. System failure.</i>

868
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:10,200
- <i>Booster malfunction.</i>
- Look!

869
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:11,700
<i>Danger. Danger.</i>

870
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,700
- What is it?
- It might be our way out of here.

871
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,500
I see them, commander.

872
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:37,900
Ready assault teams.
All hands on deck.

873
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:29,500
One shot.

874
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,100
You got your story.

875
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:52,600
Polly.

876
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
- You...
- It's all right.

877
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:57,500
You don't have to say anything.

878
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,800
Lens cap.

879
01:32:02,200 --> 01:34:01,000
