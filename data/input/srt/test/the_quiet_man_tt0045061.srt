1
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:54,081
Well, then... Urrmm, now.

2
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,917
I´ll begin at the beginnin´.

3
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,120
A fine, soft day in the spring it was

4
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,157
when the train pulled into Castletown,
three hours late as usual,

5
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,527
and himself got out.

6
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:10,631
He didn´t have the look
of an American tourist at all about him,

7
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:14,835
not a camera on him and, what was worst,
not even a fishing-rod.

8
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,438
Castletown?

9
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:28,482
- Castletown?
- Could you tell me the way to Inisfree?

10
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:32,386
Inisfree? Aw, five miles and maybe a half more.

11
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,688
- Do you see that road over there?
- Yeah.

12
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:39,526
Don´t take that one, it´ll do you no good.
Now, the best road to Inisfree, and many...

13
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:44,431
Oh, Inisfree you want. Be savin´ your breath,
let me direct the gentleman.

14
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,133
Happen to know the way to Knoghenor?

15
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:50,237
If you knew the way there,
would he be asking the way to Inisfree?

16
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,973
There´s many knows Knoghenor
that doesn´t know Inisfree.

17
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,443
If you´d take the time to study
your country´s history, Mr Maloney...

18
00:02:56,643 --> 00:03:00,547
- ...you´d be the first to admit it.
- Don´t send the poor man there.

19
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:04,952
The fishing is finished there entirely.
Tell me, Yank, what is it that you´re after?

20
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:08,755
- Is it trout or salmon?
- All I want is to get to Inisfree.

21
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:12,092
Ah, now you´re talking sense.
The best fishing in the country.

22
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:15,796
- True.
- Trout as long as your arm.

23
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:20,601
And salmon! The last one I got,
I expected Jonah to pop out of his mouth.

24
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,470
Ah, Inisfree. I´d bring you there myself,

25
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,639
only I got to drive the train.

26
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:29,743
Hey, was I tellin´ you about that trout
I got two summers before last?

27
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,613
- At Inisfree?
- Not at all!

28
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,882
At Ballygar, over the other end of the country.

29
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:39,720
My sister´s third young one is living at Inisfree,

30
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,524
and she´d be only too happy
to show you the road.

31
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:47,761
- No, no, if she was here.
- It´s Inisfree the man wants to go to.

32
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:52,299
- You see that signpost over there?
- What do you know...

33
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,583
Inisfree, this way.

34
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:38,178
I wonder, now, why a man would go to Inisfree.

35
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:06,340
- Six foot six?
- Four and a half.

36
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:27,494
- Cincinnati?
- No, Pittsburgh.

37
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,863
Pi..Pitss...

38
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:50,317
Don´t you remember, Seaneen, and how it was.

39
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:56,190
The road led up past the chapel,
and it wound, and it wound,

40
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,761
and there was the field where
Dan Tobin´s bull chased you.

41
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:06,166
It was a lovely little house, Seaneen,
and the roses.!

42
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:12,139
Your father used to tease me about them,
but he was that proud of them, too.

43
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:18,445
That´s nothin´ but a wee humble cottage.

44
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:40,033
That little place across the brook,
that humble cottage. Who owns it now?

45
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,736
The widow Tillane. Not that she lives there.

46
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:45,138
- You think she´d sell it?
- I doubt it.

47
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:48,041
Don´t bet on it ´cause I´m buyin´ it.

48
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:52,679
Why...why would a Yankee from Pittsburgh
want to buy it?

49
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:56,950
I´ll tell you why, Michaleen Oge Flynn,
young small Michael Flynn,

50
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,520
who used to wipe my runny nose
when I was kid.

51
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:04,091
Because I´m Sean Thornton,
and I was born in that little cottage.

52
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,462
And I´ve come home, and home I´m gonna stay.

53
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:12,733
Does that answer your questions
once and for all, you nosy little man?

54
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:17,204
Seaneen Thornton... The...

55
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,740
And look at you now.

56
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,177
What do they feed you,
all you men who are in Pittsburgh?

57
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:29,449
Steel, and pig-iron furnaces so hot
a man forgets his fear of hell.

58
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:34,188
When you´re hard enough,
tough enough...other things.

59
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,659
Other things, Michaleen.

60
00:07:55,976 --> 00:08:00,881
Now then, here comes myself,
that´s me there, walking.

61
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:07,621
That tall, saintly-looking man.
Peter Lonergan, parish priest.

62
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:11,391
Good day, Father. Sean, this is Father Lonergan.

63
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:16,430
Father, would you believe it?
This is Sean Thornton,

64
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,833
born right here in Inisfree, home from America.

65
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:22,970
- Hello, Father.
- Ah, yes.

66
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,772
I knew your people, Sean.

67
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:32,112
Your grandfather...
He died in Australia, in a penal colony.

68
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:35,749
And your father, he was a good man too.

69
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:39,486
Bad accident, that. And your mother?

70
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,656
She´s dead. America, when I was twelve.

71
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:48,762
I´ll remember her in the mass tomorrow.
You´ll be there, seven o´clock.

72
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,864
- Sure, I will.
- Good.

73
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:54,168
Sean, I´d like to have a little word
with Michaleen here.

74
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:57,004
- Sure thing, Father.
- It´ll only take a minute.

75
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:00,407
- It´s a little matter...
- Take your time. I´ll be up ahead.

76
00:10:03,504 --> 00:10:05,706
(MICHALEEN): Sean!

77
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:17,684
Hey, is that real?. She couldn´t be.

78
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:23,357
Uh, nonsense, man. It´s only a mirage
brought on by your terrible thirst.

79
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:26,293
Come up, Napoleon.

80
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:23,851
Over here we pronounce it ´´Co-han´´.

81
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,322
Good morning.

82
00:12:56,276 --> 00:13:01,715
None of that now.
It´s a bold, sinful man you are, Sean Thornton.

83
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:05,519
Who told you to playing patty fingers
in the Holy Water?

84
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,921
- Just being polite, that´s all.
- What is this?

85
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:11,091
Maybe you don´t know
it´s a privilege only for courting couples,

86
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,727
and then only when the banns have been read.

87
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:18,699
And Mary Kate Danaher
dippin´ her fingers in as neat as you please.

88
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:23,337
- What did you say her name was?
- Mary Kate Danaher.

89
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,606
And don´t be getting any notions in your head.

90
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:29,376
- Mary Kate...
- Forget it, Sean, forget it.

91
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:32,379
- Put it out of your mind.
- Why? What´s the matter?

92
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,716
- She isn´t married or anything?
- Married? That one?

93
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:39,219
Not likely. And her
with her freckles and her temper.

94
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:43,023
Oh, that red head of hers is no lie.

95
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:46,860
Still, a man might put up with that
but not with her lack of a fortune.

96
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:02,976
The wealthiest woman in Inisfree
was the widow Tillane.

97
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:05,612
She had neither chick nor child, poor soul,

98
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:09,650
but she was well-respected
and good to the poor.

99
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:13,387
- So you were born there, is that it?
- Yes, ma´am.

100
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:16,790
All Thorntons were born there,
seven generations.

101
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:20,460
I see. And what is your thought, Mr Thornton,

102
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:24,731
are you planning to turn
White O´ Mornin´ into a national shrine?

103
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:28,302
Perhaps charge tuppence a visit
for a guided tour

104
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:33,774
through the cottage where the Thorntons
were born. Are you a man of such eminence?

105
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:35,709
No, not exactly.

106
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:41,815
My own family has been in Ireland since
the Normans came hundreds of years ago,

107
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:46,687
but we´ve seen no reason to establish
monuments or memorials...

108
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:51,024
Look, Mrs Tillane, I´m not talking about
memorials or monuments.

109
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:56,196
Ever since I was a kid
living in a shack near the slag heaps,

110
00:14:56,396 --> 00:15:00,534
my mother has told me about
Inisfree and White O´ Mornin´.

111
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:05,005
Inisfree has become
another word for heaven to me.

112
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:09,910
When I quit the... When I decided to come here,
it was with one thought in mind.

113
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,946
Inisfree is far from being a heaven, Mr Thornton.

114
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,917
Ma´am, Mr Red Will Danaher
wishes to be announced,

115
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:20,020
I mean, Squire Danaher.

116
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,189
Watch your muddy boots!

117
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,964
- Mrs Tillane.
- Mr Thornton, from America.

118
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:33,133
- Aw!
- Boo.

119
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,870
It´s him I´m here about, Mrs Tillane.

120
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,640
- (WILL): Is it true?
- Is what true?

121
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,344
That behind me back, he´s trying to steal
White O´ Mornin´ right from under me nose?

122
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:47,548
And what concern of yours is this, Will Danaher?

123
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:51,118
Concern? Concern enough.

124
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:54,521
Haven´t I made you a fair offer
for that same piece of land?

125
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:59,193
- And mine, lying right next to yours?
- You may keep your offers.

126
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:04,431
- Oh, so it´s true. You sold it!
- No, I have not.

127
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:12,706
Oh, I knew it was a dirty lie
the very minute I heard it!

128
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,442
Sure, I said to him,

129
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:19,613
´´Paggy McFarland, I won´t believe
that Sarah´d be selling White O´ Mornin´.´´

130
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:23,684
(WILL): Why, it would be like building a fence
between your land and mine.

131
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:29,523
´´And for a stranger to move in´´, says I.
´´What would she be doing that for?´´

132
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:32,426
And us so close to an understanding,
you might say.

133
00:16:32,626 --> 00:16:35,662
- So you told him all that?
- That I did.

134
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:39,399
Down at the pub, I suppose,
in front of all those big ears,

135
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,136
with pints in their fists
and pipes in their mouths.

136
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,607
You may have the land, Mr Thornton,
for 600 pounds.

137
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:49,843
- Done!
- No, you can´t. 610!

138
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:52,946
As I remember, you said 700 pounds.

139
00:16:53,147 --> 00:16:57,217
See here, little man... 710!

140
00:16:57,451 --> 00:17:00,921
- How about an even thousand?
- A thousand and...

141
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:06,793
And...and I´ll be saying good day to you,
Mrs Tillane, and all here but one.

142
00:17:06,994 --> 00:17:09,963
And I´ve got you down in my book.

143
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,502
My dad remembers his dad well.

144
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:19,072
Mike Thornton.
He had shoulders on him like an ox.

145
00:17:19,273 --> 00:17:25,312
I saw him meself this mornin´. A tall,
handsome man, as I was passin´ that chapel.

146
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:31,351
If you´d pass the pub as fast as you pass
the chapel, you´d be better off, little squint.

147
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:53,240
Just look at them!
Eating me out of house and home.

148
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,377
Get back to the fields! There´s work to be done.

149
00:18:06,987 --> 00:18:11,124
Isn´t it a bit early in the day
for the bottle...even for you?

150
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:14,261
Feeney, get your book out.

151
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:20,734
Set down the name, the one Sean Thornton.

152
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:25,339
Oh, look at me clean floor! You dirty little...

153
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:29,476
- Shut your gob.
- Aw, shut you, little man! Here.

154
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:33,013
Clean it up yourself,
or there will be no dinner tonight!

155
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:40,487
There now! Look now,
you mustn´t mind himself this day.

156
00:18:40,721 --> 00:18:44,224
That´s all the work you´re good for,
you little tattletail.

157
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:49,663
- Feeney, have you written the name I gave you?
- I have.

158
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:55,435
Well, strike a line through it.
That´s for him. Sean Thornton...

159
00:18:56,303 --> 00:19:00,874
So... He bought White O´ Mornin´
in spite of you.

160
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,815
Good for widow Tillane.

161
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:12,186
Pay no attention to her at all! Take no notice.

162
00:19:12,386 --> 00:19:15,422
You do, and there´ll be a fine wake
in this house tonight.

163
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:19,159
After all, he´s got more right to that land
than you have!

164
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:32,973
He´ll regret it to his dying day,
if ever he lives that long.

165
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:40,647
- Will it be all right if I leave my bags in here?
- I imagine they´ll be safe enough.

166
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:46,787
If you see a little guy, Michaleen Flynn,
tell him I´m waiting for him in the bar.

167
00:19:46,987 --> 00:19:51,091
- It´ll be a pleasure, especially for Michaleen.
- Thanks.

168
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,594
Is there anything you should like now, Yank?

169
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:59,900
If I think of anything, I´ll let you know.

170
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:08,242
(BAR IS QUIET)

171
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,678
Evening.

172
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:17,417
Pleasant night.

173
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:24,424
- I´ll try one of those black beers.
- Oh, the porter. Yes, sir.

174
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:34,501
Sir, will you join me? Matter of fact,
I´d like to buy everybody a drink.

175
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:39,072
I do not believe I heard your name, tall man.

176
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:41,809
Thornton. Sean Thornton.

177
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:46,246
And... your father´s name?

178
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:51,518
Mike. Michael Thornton.
He used to live here, by the Mornin´.

179
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:55,689
I just bought the place back.
That´s why I´m here.

180
00:20:55,889 --> 00:21:01,428
Then your grandfather
would be Ol´ Sean Thornton.

181
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:05,232
- Right.
- Bless his memory.

182
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,801
So it´s himself you´re named after.

183
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:14,074
Well, now. That being the case, it is
a pleasant evening and we will have a drink.

184
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:21,281
* There was a wild colonial boy

185
00:21:21,482 --> 00:21:25,452
#Jack Duggan was his name

186
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,391
# He was born and bred in Ireland

187
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:35,929
# In a town called Castlemaine

188
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:39,933
- Good evening, Father.
- Is the rest of the committee here?

189
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,869
- They´re waiting.
- Sorry we´re late.

190
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:47,174
- The fishing was bad, was it?
- Fine lot of time we had for that!

191
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:50,677
- Oh, Michaleen...
- Commandant Forbes.

192
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:54,848
You can forget about the Commandant.
We´re at peace now.

193
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:57,918
Sure, but I haven´t given up hope.

194
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:02,789
- Your Yankee friend is waitin´ in the bar.
- Oh, he´s here already...

195
00:22:03,023 --> 00:22:05,459
Wait a minute. Who is he anyway?

196
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:11,431
He´s a nice, quiet, peacelovin´ man
come home to Ireland to forget his troubles.

197
00:22:11,632 --> 00:22:16,103
- Troubles?
- Yes, he´s a millionaire like all the Yanks.

198
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:19,673
But he is eccentric. Wait till I show you.

199
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:26,446
- What is it?
- A bag to sleep in. A sleeper bag they call it.

200
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:31,385
I´m tellin´ you. The sleeper bag...
Wait till I show you how it operates.

201
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:34,254
- Where does it open?
- Hurry up, I have an important appointment.

202
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:36,557
- Well, open it up!
- Here.

203
00:22:36,757 --> 00:22:41,295
# At the early age of sixteen years

204
00:22:41,495 --> 00:22:45,566
# He left his native home

205
00:22:45,766 --> 00:22:50,637
# And to Australia´s sunny shores

206
00:22:50,838 --> 00:22:55,242
# He was inclined to roam

207
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:59,980
# He robbed a wealthy squireen

208
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:04,685
# All arms he did destroy

209
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:09,389
# A terror to Australia was

210
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:14,394
# This wild colonial boy

211
00:23:15,496 --> 00:23:21,969
Sean Thornton, the men of Inisfree
bid you welcome home.

212
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:24,104
Thank you.

213
00:23:24,805 --> 00:23:29,143
´´And the men of Inisfree
bid you welcome home.´´

214
00:23:29,877 --> 00:23:33,380
- What´s wrong with that little speech?
- Oh, you´d be knowin´ what.

215
00:23:40,988 --> 00:23:44,558
I´m a man from Inisfree, and the best man.

216
00:23:45,192 --> 00:23:47,694
And I bid no welcome to a man fool enough

217
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:52,199
to pay 1000 pounds for a bit of land
that isn´t worth 200!

218
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:54,001
True for you, squire.

219
00:23:54,201 --> 00:24:00,440
(MAN): Didn´t I hear of someone
named Danaher bid 810?

220
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:08,315
Get your book out.
Put his name down: Dermot Fahy.

221
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:12,619
F-A-H-Y. No e´s, Squireen Danaher.

222
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,521
If you were half the man you think you are,

223
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:18,025
you wouldn´t begrudge a Thornton
the right to his birthplace.

224
00:24:18,225 --> 00:24:21,895
- What right has he to a land he´s never worked?
- It´s Thornton land, isn´t it?

225
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:25,432
- You´ve too much of your own as it is.
- Quiet, if you please.

226
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:29,703
Parliamentary procedure.
Squire Danaher has the floor.

227
00:24:29,903 --> 00:24:32,873
If I had the floor...

228
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:37,044
- ...I´d hit that big ape with it.
- Hold on.

229
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:40,314
I don´t blame Mr Danaher for gettin´ on his ear.

230
00:24:40,514 --> 00:24:44,818
Who´s on his ear? Why, you and ten like you
couldn´t put a Danaher on his ear.

231
00:24:45,018 --> 00:24:48,021
- It´s just a way of speaking...
- Mind your ways, then.

232
00:24:48,222 --> 00:24:53,694
The point is, it´s already done. I own
the property now, and since we´re neighbours...

233
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:56,263
Neighbours? Neighbours...

234
00:24:57,564 --> 00:24:58,966
Never!

235
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:03,570
And if I so much as catch you putting
one foot on my property, I...I...

236
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:08,008
And, oh, another thing.
You keep away from my sister Mary Kate.

237
00:25:08,242 --> 00:25:10,310
She´s not for the likes of you.

238
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:14,715
Where I come from, we don´t talk
about our womenfolk in saloons.

239
00:25:14,915 --> 00:25:18,018
You sort of make a habit of it.
This morning it was widow Tillane.

240
00:25:18,218 --> 00:25:22,389
- What´s that?
- That´s true. It´s ashamed you should be.

241
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:26,827
Hey, look, I´m not accusing Mary Kate.
It´s him.

242
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:30,631
Why, this very moment,
let him deny it if he can.

243
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:34,168
At the back of the chapel,
he took liberties that he shouldn´t have.

244
00:25:34,401 --> 00:25:37,571
- I said ´´good morning´´ to her.
- Good morning?

245
00:25:37,771 --> 00:25:40,874
- It was ´´good night´´ you had on your mind.
- That´s a lie.

246
00:25:41,074 --> 00:25:42,910
(MUSIC STOPS)

247
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:46,547
- That´s a what?
- I said ´´that´s a lie´´.

248
00:25:48,448 --> 00:25:52,619
That´s a word I take from no man!
Put up your fists.

249
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,189
- I´m not gonna fight you.
- But I´m gonna...

250
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:59,693
Thank you.

251
00:26:02,196 --> 00:26:05,365
(FATHER): Danaher!
What´s the matter with you?

252
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:08,535
(FORBES): He´s drunk!
Feeney, take him home, will you.

253
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:11,371
(FEENEY): Don´t soil your knuckles on the man.

254
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:14,208
- Come on, what do you say?
- Never.

255
00:26:14,408 --> 00:26:17,044
Take the man´s hand, or I´ll read your name
on a mass on Sunday.

256
00:26:17,277 --> 00:26:20,314
- (FEENEY): Take it.
- I´d join the Church of Ireland first.

257
00:26:20,514 --> 00:26:24,885
As if they´d have you.
Shake his hand like I tell you.

258
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:28,222
- (FEENEY): Come on, come on.
- Shake hands?

259
00:26:35,662 --> 00:26:40,567
It´s a good grip you have.
I always hated a flappy handshake myself.

260
00:26:49,843 --> 00:26:52,279
Father Paul!

261
00:26:52,513 --> 00:26:57,050
Michaleen, introduce me to this quiet,
peacelovin´ man of yours.

262
00:26:57,251 --> 00:27:00,621
I have a strange notion
we´re going to be friends, Yank.

263
00:27:00,821 --> 00:27:04,458
Give me a minute.
Just let some blood run back into this.

264
00:27:04,658 --> 00:27:11,365
Sean Thornton... His grandfather,
a grand man he was, was hung in Australia.

265
00:27:11,565 --> 00:27:17,004
I could tell you blood-curdlin´ stories about him,
but me throat...

266
00:27:17,204 --> 00:27:19,840
(SEAN): All right, come on.

267
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:25,979
# He was born and bred in Ireland

268
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:30,717
# In a town called Castlemaine

269
00:27:30,918 --> 00:27:35,856
# He was his father´s only son

270
00:27:36,056 --> 00:27:40,694
# His mother´s pride and joy

271
00:27:40,894 --> 00:27:45,833
# And dearly did his parents love

272
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:48,936
# This wild colonial boy

273
00:28:39,686 --> 00:28:44,625
Are you sure you won´t change your mind,
and come around home with me?

274
00:28:44,858 --> 00:28:48,562
Don´t worry about it.
I´ve got my sleeping bag, haven´t I.

275
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:52,533
Well, it´s a nice, soft night.

276
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:57,437
So, I think I´lljoin my comrades,
and talk a little treason.

277
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:00,808
- Good night, Sean.
- Good night, Michaleen.

278
00:29:01,475 --> 00:29:02,743
(MICHALEEN): God bless you.

279
00:30:31,632 --> 00:30:34,368

(MARY KATE SCREAMS)

281
00:31:03,564 --> 00:31:06,467
So bold one you are.
Who gave you leave to be kissin´ me?

282
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:10,103
- So you can talk?
- Yes, I can, I will, and I do.

283
00:31:10,304 --> 00:31:12,873
It´s more than talk you´ll be gettin´
if you step closer.

284
00:31:13,073 --> 00:31:16,610
- Don´t worry. You´ve got a wallop.
- You´ll get over it, I´m thinkin´.

285
00:31:16,844 --> 00:31:20,981
Some things a man doesn´t get over so easily.

286
00:31:21,181 --> 00:31:23,784
Like what supposin´?

287
00:31:23,984 --> 00:31:29,223
Like the sight of a girl coming through the fields,
with the sun on her hair.

288
00:31:30,524 --> 00:31:35,395
- Kneeling in church, with a face like a saint.
- Saint, indeed.

289
00:31:35,596 --> 00:31:39,433
And now, coming to a man´s house
to clean it for him.

290
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:42,936
But...that was just my way
of bein´ a good Christian act.

291
00:31:43,137 --> 00:31:47,174
I know it was, Mary Kate Danaher,
and it was nice of you.

00:31:50,711 --> 00:31:52,913
Not at all.

293
00:33:06,253 --> 00:33:09,957
- Hello.
- Good morning, Mr Thornton.

294
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:13,327
- How are you, Fa..Doctor...
- No, no. Mr.

295
00:33:13,527 --> 00:33:17,264
And on formal occasions,
the Reverend Mr Playfair.

296
00:33:17,464 --> 00:33:19,199
And this is Mrs Playfair.

297
00:33:19,433 --> 00:33:23,904
(MRS PLAYFAIR): Well, Mr Thornton.
You are a wonder.

298
00:33:24,104 --> 00:33:30,244
It looks the way all the Irish cottages
should...and so seldom do.

299
00:33:30,444 --> 00:33:35,015
And only an American
would have thought of emerald green.

300
00:33:35,215 --> 00:33:40,387
- Red is more durable.
- And the roses! How nice.

301
00:33:40,587 --> 00:33:46,527
You´ll need lots of horse manure.
Fertiliser, I mean. Horse is the best.

302
00:33:46,727 --> 00:33:52,966
Oh, I brought you a plant.
You know, ´´a primrose by a river´s brink´´.

303
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:57,404
´´Brim´´, not ´´brink´´.
The next line ends in ´´hymn´´.

304
00:33:57,604 --> 00:34:02,242
Poets are so silly, aren´t they?
Oh, I hope you´re not one, Mr Thornton.

305
00:34:02,442 --> 00:34:05,612
- Oh no, ma´am, I...
- Thornton.

306
00:34:06,747 --> 00:34:08,949
There´s a familiar ring to it.

307
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:14,855
Ring to it... Thornton...

308
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:19,760
It´s a common name.
Thank you for the plant, Mrs Playfair,

309
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,363
this is damn...darn...awfully nice of you.

310
00:34:24,531 --> 00:34:26,567
Oh?

311
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:44,818
It´s a bed. Excuse me.

312
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:51,558
- Morning.
- (MAN): That´s a fine big bed, Mr Thornton.

313
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:54,394
Biggest one I could find.

314
00:35:08,742 --> 00:35:12,012
Is that a bed or a parade ground?

315
00:35:12,212 --> 00:35:16,250
Oh, a man´d have to be a sprinter
to catch his wife in a bed like that.

316
00:35:27,594 --> 00:35:29,797
(HORSE WHINNIES)

317
00:35:31,765 --> 00:35:33,600
Whoa!

318
00:35:51,452 --> 00:35:57,357
Mr Flynn... And what are you
all dressed up for, Michaleen Oge?

319
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:02,629
I ha...

320
00:36:07,868 --> 00:36:11,872
- I have come...
- Oh, I can see that.

321
00:36:12,072 --> 00:36:15,609
- But from whose pub was it?
- P...pub?

322
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:21,849
You´ve a tongue like an adder.
I go about me own business,

323
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:26,386
and tell Thorn Seanton
he´s well off without you.

324
00:36:26,587 --> 00:36:30,157
Wait a minute. What was that?

325
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:35,629
Well, if you listened
and not be interruptin´ the matchmaker.

326
00:36:38,665 --> 00:36:42,369
I have come...

327
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:47,407
- ...at the request of Thorn Seanton...
- Sean Thornton.

328
00:36:47,608 --> 00:36:49,276
Shut up.

329
00:36:50,344 --> 00:36:54,948
...bachelor, and party of the first part...

330
00:36:57,785 --> 00:37:03,791
...to ask of you, strictly and formally, here...

331
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:08,862
...Mary Kate Danaher, spinster...

332
00:37:09,763 --> 00:37:12,065
...and party to the second part...

333
00:37:15,969 --> 00:37:19,306
Well?. Go on, you were sayin´?

334
00:37:19,506 --> 00:37:25,813
Me mouth is like a dry crust,
and the sun is that hot, and me pate...

335
00:37:26,046 --> 00:37:28,515
Would you be steppin´ into the parlour?

336
00:37:28,715 --> 00:37:34,321
The house may belong to my brother,
but what´s in the parlour belongs to me.

337
00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:39,893
I will then, and I hope there´s a bottle there,
whoever it belongs to.

338
00:37:40,127 --> 00:37:41,895
It could be.

339
00:37:51,138 --> 00:37:54,141
You have a fine, steady hand.

340
00:38:08,522 --> 00:38:10,958
To good bargaining.

341
00:38:16,697 --> 00:38:18,532
To resume:

342
00:38:18,765 --> 00:38:20,901
- The party of the first part...
- That´s him.

343
00:38:21,101 --> 00:38:27,407
...has instructed me to enquire
before enterin´ into formal negotiations...

344
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:30,811
- ...whether the party to the second part...
- That´s me.

345
00:38:31,011 --> 00:38:37,451
...thinks kindly of the general idea,
or in his own words...American, eh...

346
00:38:38,118 --> 00:38:42,489
- ...eh, yes, he wants to know if you go for it.
- Go for it?

347
00:38:42,723 --> 00:38:47,694
- And if you do, he´ll speak to your brother.
- That won´t be easy.

348
00:38:47,895 --> 00:38:49,930
Oh, as well I know it.

349
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:55,235
He´d as soon put his fist into my teeth
as bid me the time of the day.

350
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:01,141
What did Sean...the party of the first part,
say about my fortune?

351
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:04,011
He says he doesn´t give it...

352
00:39:05,546 --> 00:39:08,982
He says it´s a matter of
complete indifference to him.

353
00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:13,487
- He did?
- He says he doesn´t give a sh...

354
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:19,960
He says it´s all one to him if you come
in the clothes on your back, or without them.

355
00:39:24,465 --> 00:39:27,734
Oh, he did, did he? Well.

356
00:39:27,935 --> 00:39:32,739
A fine opinion he must have of me, if he thinks
I´d go to any man without a proper fortune.

357
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,210
And this you may tell
your Mr Party of the first part:

358
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:40,881
When I wed, whatever´s my own, goes with me.

359
00:39:41,115 --> 00:39:42,683
Get up, little man.

360
00:39:51,091 --> 00:39:53,060
And all this furniture is mine.

361
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:57,231
And I have that china, and linen,
and 50 pounds in gold my father left me,

362
00:39:57,431 --> 00:40:02,769
and my mother´s rings, brooches,
my grandmother´s veil, her silver comb...

363
00:40:03,537 --> 00:40:10,210
Thirty pounds odd in notes and silver
I´ve earned these past 15 years, that´s all.

364
00:40:11,712 --> 00:40:17,184
You´re a well propertied woman.
I wouldn´t mind marryin´ you meself.

365
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,524
Eh, where´d you leave the bottle?

366
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:32,065
And I´d have you tell him, that I´m no pauper
to be going to him in my shift.

367
00:40:43,343 --> 00:40:49,016
# Lo, young May moon is beamin´ love

368
00:40:49,216 --> 00:40:54,755
# The glow of one´s lamp is gleamin´ love

369
00:40:54,988 --> 00:41:00,894
# How sweet to row through Mourner´s Grove

370
00:41:02,095 --> 00:41:08,702
# While the drowsy world is dreamin´...

371
00:41:08,902 --> 00:41:11,638
- You know ´´The Peter And The Ghost´´.?
- I do not.

372
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,443
- Neither do I.
- Could you use a little water in your whiskey?

373
00:41:16,643 --> 00:41:22,883
When I drink whiskey, I drink whiskey,
and when I drink water, I drink water.

374
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:25,919
Back to business now.

375
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:30,657
What answer will I give Sean Thornton,
Mary Kate Danaher?

376
00:41:30,858 --> 00:41:34,328
Well, you can tell him from me that...

377
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:40,567
...that I go for it.

378
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:46,406
# Here´s to steal a few hours from the night

379
00:41:47,141 --> 00:41:50,944
# My dear

380
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,028
- How do I look?
- You look fine.

381
00:42:29,016 --> 00:42:32,352
- Hey, what do I say?
- I´ll do all the talkin´.

382
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:36,957
- And I´m suppose to stand here like a dummy?
- Shh, now.

383
00:42:42,996 --> 00:42:47,868
- Will, there´s someone coming to call.
- Who?

384
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:50,304
It´s... well...

385
00:42:50,537 --> 00:42:54,741
It´s Michaleen Oge Flynn,
and there´s a gentleman with him.

386
00:42:57,277 --> 00:43:00,013
Here, Will, put on your coat.

387
00:43:01,348 --> 00:43:04,351
Will Danaher, they´re comin´ to the front door.

388
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:07,688
Since when has the back door
been not good enough?

389
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:19,500
- (MICHALEEN): God bless all in this house.
- (SEAN): Good evening.

390
00:43:19,733 --> 00:43:22,903
(MICHALEEN): Miss Danaher,
we´d like a word with your brother.

391
00:43:24,571 --> 00:43:27,674
Come on in so, and welcome.

392
00:43:28,542 --> 00:43:31,145
Easy now!

393
00:43:36,884 --> 00:43:43,590
Mr Sean Thornton, bachelor,
meet Miss Mary Kate Danaher, spinster.

394
00:43:44,691 --> 00:43:50,864
Miss Danaher, meet Mr Thornton
from Pittsburgh, Massachusetts, USA.

395
00:43:51,431 --> 00:43:54,401
- Good evening, Miss Danaher.
- This...

396
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:58,338
This way, please.

397
00:44:08,248 --> 00:44:10,584
- Eh, this is my brother...
- Leave the room.

398
00:44:10,784 --> 00:44:13,921
- But...
- I said, leave the room.

399
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:18,358
- Yes, Will.
- Sit down, that´s what chairs are for.

400
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:24,164
- If you´ve come for supper, you´re late.
- Gracious invitation, but thank you, no.

401
00:44:25,098 --> 00:44:28,635
I don´t suppose there´s a drop in the house.

402
00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:33,907
- Help yourself to the buttermilk.
- Buttermilk? The Borgias would do better.

403
00:44:34,108 --> 00:44:40,047
We´ll come with your permission
to the object of this visit.

404
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:47,054
You´ve noticed, I presume,
that I´m wearin´ my official black coat.

405
00:44:47,254 --> 00:44:50,591
I have. For your dead friend here.

406
00:44:51,792 --> 00:44:54,194
(WILL): I need no trouble
to arrange any marriages for me.

407
00:44:54,394 --> 00:45:00,400
I see. You´ve been making fine progress
with widow Tillane in the last ten years.

408
00:45:00,601 --> 00:45:02,970
- Is that what you´ve come to talk about?
- I have not.

409
00:45:03,203 --> 00:45:06,874
- I´ve come to talk about your sister and him.
- Aw, get out.

410
00:45:07,074 --> 00:45:10,778
If he was the last man
on the face of the earth, I´d still say no.

411
00:45:10,978 --> 00:45:14,748
- Now just a minute.
- If it´s a question of the girl´s fortune...

412
00:45:14,948 --> 00:45:19,219
Why, if it´d be a shilling piece
he wanted with her...

413
00:45:19,419 --> 00:45:22,856
- ...I´d still say no.
- Come on, Michaleen. I told you so.

414
00:45:23,056 --> 00:45:26,627
- I´ll explain it to her myself.
- Hey, Yank, I´ll count three.

415
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:29,930
If you´re not out of the house by then,
I´ll loose the dogs on you.

416
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:35,502
If you say three,
you´ll never hear the man count ten.

417
00:45:47,581 --> 00:45:53,053
- Oh, Mary Kate, we tried.
- We´ll see him again some other time.

418
00:45:57,024 --> 00:46:00,761
I thank you anyway,
Sean Thornton, for the asking.

419
00:46:00,994 --> 00:46:06,099
You don´t think this changes anything?
It´s what you say that counts, not him.

420
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,669
Now, now, Sean.
You´ve gone too far, that´s enough.

421
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:13,474
Say, what is this?
We´re gonna get married, aren´t we?

422
00:46:23,851 --> 00:46:27,521
- I don´t get it.
- This is Ireland, Sean, not America.

423
00:46:27,754 --> 00:46:33,894
Without her brother´s consent she couldn´t,
and wouldn´t. I´m sorry for both of you.

424
00:47:07,461 --> 00:47:13,567
Those were the bad days. Sean with a face
as dark as the black hunter he rode.

425
00:47:13,767 --> 00:47:16,036
A fine, ill-tempered pair they were.

426
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:18,972
It was only a matter of time
before one or the other broke his neck.

427
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:21,475
We knew things couldn´t go on this way.

428
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:31,685
Easy, Sean!

429
00:47:42,429 --> 00:47:45,499
Hello, Mary Kate...Danaher.

430
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:49,903
Good morning, Sean Thornton.

431
00:47:58,612 --> 00:48:01,081
So, we formed a little conspiracy.

432
00:48:01,281 --> 00:48:07,955
The Reverend Mr and Mrs Playfair,
Michaleen Oge and, saints forgive us, myself.

433
00:48:08,856 --> 00:48:14,294
And on the day of the Inisfree Races,
we sprung the trap on Red Will Danaher.

434
00:48:51,398 --> 00:48:54,168
Remember, you make your speed
when you hit the water.

435
00:48:54,368 --> 00:48:57,604
- Yes, father.
- And ride carefully, my son.

436
00:48:57,805 --> 00:48:59,206

587
01:13:07,087 --> 01:13:12,092
Eh, today, I´ve given my sister in marriage.

588
01:13:13,527 --> 01:13:19,933
My only sister, and now she´s gone from the house of Danaher.

- But what´s in a house without a woman? - That´s true.

01:13:24,705 --> 01:13:26,774
That´s right, what´s a house without a woman in it?

591
01:13:26,974 --> 01:13:29,843
Yeah, what´s a house without a woman in it?

592
01:13:30,043 --> 01:13:34,014
Where would any man of us be without a woman?

593
01:13:34,214 --> 01:13:38,318
- Even Father Lonergan had a mother. - What do you expect?

594
01:13:38,519 --> 01:13:42,389
Yeah, what do you expect. What do you expect...

595

- So, without further eloquence... 
- Without further eloquence...

597

I will give you a toast to myself...

...who is soon to be wed.

All she has to do is to say that little word.

When´s the happy day, Sarah darlin´?

601

Have you lost the little sense you were born with?

602
01:14:19,126 --> 01:14:23,464

- And don´t ´´darlin´´´ me.

- Oh, I didn´t, I didn´t.

608
01:14:49,857 --> 01:14:53,327
Oh, you lied, didn´t ya? You lied, didn´t ya?

609
01:14:55,829 --> 01:15:00,601
You all lied! It´s bad enough for you people, 
but my own priest.

610
01:15:08,308 --> 01:15:11,779
You got her by fraud and falsity. You put them up to this.

- Will, for heaven´s sake.

- Danaher, you´re crazy! - Crazy, am I?

613
01:15:19,586 --> 01:15:22,389
This is something you won´t get, now or never!

614
01:15:24,057 --> 01:15:26,293
Now, get out of here. All of you!

- (WILL): Get out! - Come on, let´s go home.

No, not without my fortune.

I didn´t marry you for your fortune?

734
01:31:34,661 --> 01:31:40,334
- I don´t give... a hang about the money.
- But he does! That´s the whole point of it.

735
01:31:40,634 --> 01:31:45,172
- Now will you go and ask him? 
- No. Why shame ourselves?

736
01:31:45,305 --> 01:31:51,245
Shame? The shame´s on you, not on me.
Or on me too, if I married a coward.

737
01:31:52,846 --> 01:31:54,715
Is that what you think of me?

738
01:31:54,848 --> 01:31:57,317
What else if you let him rob you out of my money?

739
01:31:57,418 --> 01:32:03,357
Money! I´m sick of the talk of it.
Is that all you Danahers think about? Money?

740
01:33:36,884 --> 01:33:40,888
(FATHER): Quiet! He´s just behind that rock.

741
01:33:41,088 --> 01:33:44,291
- This is very important... 
- Oh, salmon! He´s winking at me.

742
01:33:44,491 --> 01:33:46,727
I´ve been trying to catch this one for ten years.

743
01:33:46,927 --> 01:33:50,931
I´ve got to talk to you about my husband and myself.

744
01:33:51,131 --> 01:33:53,200
There he is.

745
01:33:54,635 --> 01:33:57,237
Father, I...I...

746
01:34:00,474 --> 01:34:02,142
You see...

747
01:34:03,177 --> 01:34:07,848
- Father, could I...tell you in the Irish? 
- Hush, hush.

748
01:34:10,851 --> 01:34:15,456
(SHE SPEAKS IN GAELIC)

749
01:34:27,067 --> 01:34:30,371
(HE ANSWERS IN GAELIC)

750
01:34:32,039 --> 01:34:35,242
Sleeping bag, Father, with...

751
01:34:36,910 --> 01:34:39,446
...with buttons.

752
01:34:42,449 --> 01:34:45,886
(SHE SPEAKS IN GAELIC)

753
01:34:49,923 --> 01:34:55,062
Woman, Ireland may be a poor country, God help us,

754
01:34:55,295 --> 01:34:59,166
but here a married man sleeps in a bed, not a bag,

755
01:34:59,366 --> 01:35:04,438
and for your own good... Help, help, there he is!

756
01:35:05,773 --> 01:35:08,475
- I´ve been waiting for this for 10 years! 
- Keep his head up.

757
01:35:08,675 --> 01:35:13,414
- There´s that beauty, that...
- Keep his head up. Keep a tight line.

758
01:35:13,647 --> 01:35:17,484
I´ve got you! I´ll get him!

759
01:35:19,153 --> 01:35:22,256
- Tight line it is. - Keep his head up!

760
01:35:22,489 --> 01:35:25,059
His head is up!

761
01:35:26,693 --> 01:35:31,832
(FATHER): For ten years I have... 
Get the net, woman.

762
01:35:32,032 --> 01:35:36,704
Oh, you got him, Father. Keep his head up, you fool!

763
01:35:37,705 --> 01:35:39,073
Get the net!

764
01:35:41,141 --> 01:35:43,677
Get the net, woman!

765
01:35:45,179 --> 01:35:48,882
- God help us! - Oh.

766
01:35:52,753 --> 01:35:55,055
Sleeping bags...

767
01:36:42,836 --> 01:36:47,107
# If you ever go across the sea to Ireland

768
01:36:48,042 --> 01:36:55,182
# Then maybe at the closin´ of your day

769
01:36:56,283 --> 01:37:01,055
# You will sit and watch the moon rise

770
01:37:01,255 --> 01:37:05,492
# Over Claddagh

771
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:11,165
# And see the sun go down

772
01:37:11,398 --> 01:37:17,137
# On Galway Bay

773
01:37:18,806 --> 01:37:25,979
# For the breeze is blowin´ across the sea from Ireland

774
01:37:27,114 --> 01:37:29,249
(SINGING STOPS)

775
01:37:30,451 --> 01:37:33,454
You´re just in time. Just done me drink.

776
01:37:33,654 --> 01:37:36,356
- Join us, Sean. - Oh, you will have a drink, Sean?

777
01:37:36,523 --> 01:37:38,525
No, thanks.

778
01:37:41,528 --> 01:37:44,431
I wanna talk to you, in private.

779
01:37:47,968 --> 01:37:52,706
- If there´s anythin´ you got to say, say it here. 
- I´d rather talk in private.

780
01:37:52,906 --> 01:37:58,011
What´s the matter? You´re among friends. 
They fought for you, didn´t they?

781
01:37:58,212 --> 01:38:02,983
- Maybe they´ll do it again. 
- I´m not askin´ anybody to do my fightin´ for me.

782
01:38:03,183 --> 01:38:09,223
- Oh, so you´re willing to do your own, are you?
- You know what I came for.

783
01:38:09,423 --> 01:38:13,494
I do. I just want to hear you ask for it.

784
01:38:13,694 --> 01:38:17,131
Just ask for it, Yank.

785
01:38:17,331 --> 01:38:21,235
- You´ve got 20 pounds on him. 
- And so I have.

786
01:38:22,903 --> 01:38:28,442
What if I put one of me fists in me pocket? 
Right or left? You choose, go on.

787
01:38:28,675 --> 01:38:31,812
Go on, that´s fair enough, isn´t it?

788
01:38:34,314 --> 01:38:36,183
(WILL LAUGHS)

789
01:38:36,817 --> 01:38:39,787
The fightin´ Thornton!

790
01:39:04,878 --> 01:39:09,516
- It was Mr Thornton, so I brought him in.
- Bless my soul. Sit down.

791
01:39:09,717 --> 01:39:11,785
- Have you tiddled your last wink? 
- I have.

792
01:39:11,985 --> 01:39:14,121
- No cheating? - I have not.

793
01:39:14,822 --> 01:39:19,426
- Do you play tiddly-winks? - No, I...

794
01:39:19,626 --> 01:39:25,132
- Maybe I shouldn´t have butted in like this...
- Nonsense. How is your lovely bride?

795
01:39:25,332 --> 01:39:29,103
- Fine. - Elizabeth, say good night to Mr Thornton.

796
01:39:29,303 --> 01:39:34,808
But he´s only just come...oh. Very well. 
Good night, Mr Thornton.

797
01:39:35,008 --> 01:39:36,977
- Good night. - Good night, Cyril.

798
01:39:37,177 --> 01:39:41,014
Good night, Elizabeth. Pleasant dreams.

799
01:39:43,317 --> 01:39:46,487
- Are you sure... - Good night, Elizabeth.

800
01:39:47,888 --> 01:39:51,959
You´re the only one I can level with. 
I gotta talk to somebody, or I´ll blow my top.

801
01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:55,396
- Danaher, of course? - Yeah.

802
01:39:55,596 --> 01:40:00,334
Since you know who I am...or was,
you know why I don´t want any fighting.

803
01:40:00,534 --> 01:40:04,071
Yes, I was reading about it again this evening.

804
01:40:04,304 --> 01:40:10,978
Some men collect butterflies, some stamps. 
My hobby´s always been sporting events.

805
01:40:11,178 --> 01:40:13,213
There it is.

806
01:40:13,414 --> 01:40:15,516
´´Trooper Thorn quits ring´´

807
01:40:15,716 --> 01:40:19,620
´´Heavyweight challenger hangs up gloves 
after fatal knockout´´

808
01:40:19,820 --> 01:40:21,922
´´Vows he will never fight again´´

809
01:40:24,224 --> 01:40:26,660
It´s a very understandable reaction.

810
01:40:26,894 --> 01:40:32,066
The papers all say it was an accident. 
Just one of those things.

811
01:40:32,299 --> 01:40:38,105
It´s just one of those things in a scrapbook, 
but when you carry it around in here...

812
01:40:40,007 --> 01:40:43,744
Tony Gardello was a good egg.

813
01:40:43,944 --> 01:40:49,883
Nice little wife and a home, a couple of kids. 
A clean fighter.

814
01:40:50,751 --> 01:40:55,589
I didn´t go in there to outbox him. 
I went there to beat his brains out.

815
01:40:55,789 --> 01:41:00,360
To drive him into the canvas, to murder him. 
That´s what I did.

816
01:41:00,994 --> 01:41:05,833
For what? Purse, a piece of the gate.

817
01:41:07,534 --> 01:41:09,570
Lousy money.

818
01:41:09,770 --> 01:41:13,273
And now money is behind your trouble with Danaher.

819
01:41:13,474 --> 01:41:18,912
They think I´m afraid of fighting. 
All the friends I´ve made, even my wife.

820
01:41:19,113 --> 01:41:23,484
- Well, aren´t you in a way? 
- Did you ever kill a man?

821
01:41:25,052 --> 01:41:30,157
Well, I have, and all this talk about her big fortune...

822
01:41:31,125 --> 01:41:33,494
It´s not that important.

823
01:41:34,728 --> 01:41:36,964
Perhaps it is to her.

824
01:41:38,165 --> 01:41:42,770
It must be strange to you from America,

825
01:41:42,970 --> 01:41:47,441
but it´s an old, old custom here, and believe me, 
it´s a good custom.

826
01:41:47,641 --> 01:41:50,511
The fortune means more to her than just the money.

827
01:41:50,711 --> 01:41:54,615
Not to me, it isn´t. Not worth fighting for.

828
01:41:54,815 --> 01:41:58,519
- Is your wife´s love worth fighting for? 
- I don´t know.

829
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:07,194
All I know is that...I won´t fight, 
unless I´m mad enough to kill,

830
01:42:07,394 --> 01:42:11,098
and if that means losin´ her...I don´t know.

831
01:42:11,965 --> 01:42:16,270
- Maybe she doesn´t love me enough. 
- It´s a difficult situation.

832
01:42:17,671 --> 01:42:21,175
I think you´ll find the right answer in God´s good time.

833
01:42:21,408 --> 01:42:24,845
And when that time comes, I hope I´m still here.

834
01:42:25,045 --> 01:42:28,949
- You´re not leaving, are you? 
- It´s a possibility.

835
01:42:29,149 --> 01:42:32,853
My bishop is coming tomorrow on his annual visit,

836
01:42:33,087 --> 01:42:38,392
and I´ve got such a small congregation, 
just 2-3 people at the service.

837
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:43,697
- He may transfer me.
- The place wouldn´t be the same without you.

838
01:42:44,631 --> 01:42:50,270
Elizabeth and I just love this place. 
We were born here too, you know.

839
01:42:50,938 --> 01:42:54,708
The bishop´s a good egg, maybe it´ll be all right.

840
01:42:54,908 --> 01:42:59,580
Oh, by the way. Don´t underestimate Danaher.

841
01:42:59,780 --> 01:43:04,084
He may be clumsy, but he´s got 
a tremendous right and a jaw of granite.

842
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:10,457
I did a little bit of boxing in my time.

843
01:43:20,034 --> 01:43:22,436
You won´t be laughin´ now, will you?

844
01:43:25,139 --> 01:43:27,341
It was at Trinity.

845
01:43:27,541 --> 01:43:30,778
´´Lightweight champion, 19...´´

846
01:43:30,978 --> 01:43:34,948
The year doesn´t matter. It was long, long ago.

847
01:43:37,785 --> 01:43:40,521
All right.

848
01:43:41,121 --> 01:43:43,857
By the way, would you join me in a glass of...

849
01:43:44,958 --> 01:43:47,027
Oh, no.

850
01:43:48,362 --> 01:43:52,299
No. You´ll be in training now, of course.

851
01:45:02,369 --> 01:45:06,540
- (MARY KATE): Did you have any supper? - No.

852
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:08,876
(SEAN): I´m not hungry.

853
01:45:09,076 --> 01:45:14,081
- The drink sometimes does that to a man. 
- I haven´t had anything to drink.

854
01:45:14,314 --> 01:45:19,319
(SEAN): If you wanna know, I was talking to the vicar.

855
01:45:20,454 --> 01:45:24,725
- Mr Playfair. - That´s strange.

856
01:45:31,832 --> 01:45:34,134
I had a long talk with Father Lonergan.

857
01:46:36,864 --> 01:46:40,234
Woman of the house! Where´s me tea?

858
01:46:44,038 --> 01:46:45,539
Mary Kate?

859
01:46:45,739 --> 01:46:51,979
(MICHALEEN): Save your breath, boy. 
She´s gone from you, and small wonder.

860
01:46:52,179 --> 01:46:57,718
- What are you talking about? Where is she? 
- She came tappin´ at me door.

861
01:46:57,918 --> 01:47:01,188
- ´´Will you join me to the train´´, says she. - Why?

862
01:47:01,422 --> 01:47:06,694
The very question. ´´Why´´, says I. 
´´Because I love him´´, says she.

863
01:47:06,894 --> 01:47:10,431
´´I love him too much to go on livin´ 
with a man I´m ashamed of.´´

864
01:47:12,132 --> 01:47:16,837
- What time was this? - Time for the Dublin train.

865
01:47:29,817 --> 01:47:32,119
Saddle up my horse, will you, please.

866
01:47:33,253 --> 01:47:35,255
Saddle his horse?

867
01:47:37,658 --> 01:47:41,228
I´ll have no part in helpin´ 
you to put more shame on her.

868
01:47:42,930 --> 01:47:45,165
Saddle his horse...

869
01:47:48,268 --> 01:47:51,705
Dam da dam da, diddle de da...

870
01:48:20,634 --> 01:48:22,202
Well, we´re off!

871
01:48:22,403 --> 01:48:27,107
Then, might I suggest that the train already 
is four and a half hours late.

872
01:48:27,307 --> 01:48:30,077
Now, is it my fault?

873
01:48:30,310 --> 01:48:34,515
There´s a match at Ballygar, and the champions of all Ireland...

874
01:48:34,715 --> 01:48:39,319
If you knew your country´s history as well as 
you claim to know it,

875
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:45,125
you´d know that they haven´t been beaten 
west of the Shannon for the last 22 years.

876
01:48:45,325 --> 01:48:48,529
- True! - It´s a lie!

877
01:49:56,430 --> 01:49:59,066
If this means what I hope it means...

878
01:49:59,266 --> 01:50:03,337
Danaher versus the Yank. 
It´ll be weeks on the green this time.

879
01:50:11,912 --> 01:50:13,414
Morning.

880
01:50:22,756 --> 01:50:24,258
Good day to you, sir.

881
01:50:37,905 --> 01:50:41,341
Five minutes, did you say? Right!

882
01:50:42,710 --> 01:50:48,949
- He´s walkin´ her back, the whole long way! 
- It´s Homeric, that´s what it is, Homeric.

883
01:50:49,149 --> 01:50:52,786
- Post a lookout. They may go home first. 
- Where´s your pistol?.

884
01:50:52,986 --> 01:50:55,956
- In the same place. - Excuse me, general.

885
01:50:57,224 --> 01:51:02,229
One by land, two by sea, and I´ll follow the lot.

886
01:51:02,429 --> 01:51:04,031
What a day for Inisfree!

887
01:51:04,231 --> 01:51:09,536
On a day like this I can say only one thing. 
Gentlemen, the drinks are on the house!

888
01:51:12,606 --> 01:51:14,575
Well, they are.

889
01:51:45,539 --> 01:51:49,676
(WOMAN): Darling, here is your shoe!

890
01:51:53,814 --> 01:51:55,716
Why, you...

891
01:52:00,154 --> 01:52:04,224
It´s only five miles. Just a good stretch of the legs.

892
01:52:09,296 --> 01:52:12,933
- You lost your shoe. - Thank you very kindly, sir.

893
01:52:38,092 --> 01:52:44,732
(WOMAN): Mr... Mr Sean! Here´s 
a good stick to beat the lovely lady.

894
01:52:46,266 --> 01:52:48,202
Thanks!

895
01:52:50,471 --> 01:52:52,339
(GUNSHOTS FROM OUTSIDE)

896
01:53:48,996 --> 01:53:53,734
I think your in-laws are comin´ 
to visit you, Squire Danaher.

897
01:54:30,738 --> 01:54:36,076
Danaher, you owe me 350 pounds. Let´s have it.

898
01:54:45,219 --> 01:54:47,554
So, the IRA is in this, too, eh?

899
01:54:47,755 --> 01:54:53,227
If it were, Will Danaher, not 
a stone of your fine house´d be standin´.

900
01:54:53,460 --> 01:54:56,163
A beautiful sentiment.

901
01:55:00,267 --> 01:55:02,469
I´ll pay you...never.

902
01:55:02,669 --> 01:55:05,906
That breaks all bargains.

903
01:55:07,241 --> 01:55:11,478
(SEAN): You can take your sister back. 
It´s your custom, not mine.

904
01:55:11,679 --> 01:55:15,215
(SEAN): No fortune, no marriage. We call it quits.

905
01:55:20,554 --> 01:55:24,158
You´d do this to me, your own wife?

906
01:55:24,358 --> 01:55:27,227
- After what... - (SEAN): It´s done.

907
01:55:36,003 --> 01:55:39,139
There´s your dirty money. Take it.

908
01:55:39,373 --> 01:55:42,676
Count it, you spawn, and look.

909
01:55:42,876 --> 01:55:47,014
If ever I see that face of yours again, 
I´ll push that through it.

910
01:56:04,531 --> 01:56:06,633
Charge it!

911
01:56:10,270 --> 01:56:14,341
I´ll be goin´ on home now. 
I´ll have the supper ready for you.

912
01:56:53,480 --> 01:56:55,683
All right, Will, you asked for it.

913
01:57:08,362 --> 01:57:11,899
Three to one given on Danaher. Three to one...

914
01:57:12,099 --> 01:57:17,071
- I´ll have some of that. Ten on Thornton. 
- Done! Anyone else?

915
01:58:11,225 --> 01:58:15,429
(MICHALEEN): Gentlemen, if you please. 
This is a private fight.

916
01:58:15,629 --> 01:58:19,900
The Marquis of Queensbury rules 
will be observed on all occasions.

917
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:22,736
Mind your nose, squire.

918
01:58:23,437 --> 01:58:26,173
Okay with me, Michaleen!

919
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:31,412
Thanks.

920
01:58:31,612 --> 01:58:35,649
Non-belligerents will kindly remain neutral.

921
01:58:35,849 --> 01:58:39,687
Now, shake hands and come out fighting. I thank you.

922
01:58:39,887 --> 01:58:43,357
Did you hear that, everybody? 
The Marquis of Queensbury rules.

923
01:58:43,590 --> 01:58:45,793
- The Marquis of Queensbury rules. - Mar..

924
01:58:51,165 --> 01:58:54,234
Come on, get up, Marquis of Queensbury.

925
01:58:54,435 --> 01:58:58,872
- I hope that Thornton beats him senseless. 
- He´s a married man, Sarah.

926
01:58:59,073 --> 01:59:02,943
Who cares about him? It´s that big bully concerns me.

927
01:59:03,143 --> 01:59:06,246
´´I´m the best man in Inisfree.´´ 
As if I didn´t know that.

928
01:59:11,018 --> 01:59:15,022
Call them and tell them to send reinforcements. 
There´s a riot here.

929
01:59:30,971 --> 01:59:33,173
Five to one on the big chap, Snuffy.

930
01:59:33,374 --> 01:59:36,810
- Given or taken? - Given.

931
01:59:50,324 --> 01:59:53,060
- You´ve had enough? - No.

932
01:59:58,098 --> 02:00:00,901
Well, give a man a hand, then.

933
02:00:08,409 --> 02:00:10,711
Yes, inspector. Thank you, sir.

934
02:00:10,944 --> 02:00:14,048
- What did he say? - To put five pounds on Danaher´s nose.

935
02:00:15,049 --> 02:00:18,819
- Another ten on Thornton! - Another.

936
02:00:20,254 --> 02:00:25,426
- A pound on Danaher. - Two pounds on Danaher, please.

937
02:00:25,626 --> 02:00:28,195
Two pounds?

938
02:00:28,395 --> 02:00:32,166
´´...hands of a hundred battles, 
eye on a thousand besides...´´

939
02:00:32,366 --> 02:00:35,636
´´...stood alone on the victorious field, 
his buckler bent...´´

940
02:00:35,836 --> 02:00:38,839
´´...his broken sword clutched in his mighty hand...´´

941
02:00:39,039 --> 02:00:45,045
´´...the blood of a thousand wounds 
oozing from his open veins...´´

942
02:00:45,245 --> 02:00:47,614
(NOISE OUTSIDE)

943
02:01:11,839 --> 02:01:15,509
- Father! Father Lonergan! - Shh, shhh.

944
02:01:15,743 --> 02:01:19,246
- A big fight in the town! 
- And in this fish right here.

945
02:01:19,446 --> 02:01:23,050
- I´d put a stop to it but... 
- You do that. It´s your duty.

946
02:01:23,250 --> 02:01:26,353
But you see, it was Danaher and Sean Thornton!

947
02:01:26,553 --> 02:01:29,323
- Who? - Danaher and Sean Thornton.

948
02:01:29,523 --> 02:01:32,026
Why the devil didn´t you tell me?

949
02:01:49,410 --> 02:01:52,880
- Shouldn´t we put a stop to it? 
- We should, lad, we should.

950
02:01:53,080 --> 02:01:56,316
It´s our duty, yes, it´s our duty.

951
02:02:03,891 --> 02:02:06,593
Come on, come on!

952
02:02:13,567 --> 02:02:17,438
- How´s that bettin´ going? 
- Even money, but don´t ruin it.

953
02:02:19,373 --> 02:02:23,510
Well, Danaher, you´re a good fight, 
I´ll say that for you.

954
02:02:23,711 --> 02:02:28,015
When it comes to that, it´s been a pleasure beatin´ you.

955
02:02:35,522 --> 02:02:37,091
Thanks.

956
02:02:38,592 --> 02:02:42,496
- Will you take another 20 on Thornton? 
- No, the book´s closed.

957
02:02:44,264 --> 02:02:48,669
- A pound on Thornton against the squire. 
- Go away!

958
02:02:50,904 --> 02:02:54,141
- How about a drink? 
- The drink will be on the house.

959
02:02:54,375 --> 02:02:59,346
That´s a good idea. The people of Ballyglon are comin´ 
over by bus, thousands of them.

960
02:02:59,546 --> 02:03:03,384
That´s a good idea, not that I´m tired. 
I´m as fresh as a daisy.

961
02:03:03,584 --> 02:03:06,854
You look more like a black-eyed Susan to me. Let´s go.

962
02:03:07,321 --> 02:03:11,191
- Is that a public house? 
- Yes, your lordship.

963
02:03:11,392 --> 02:03:13,394
- Are they going in? - Yes, your lordship.

964
02:03:13,594 --> 02:03:18,766
- Does that mean that the fight´s over? 
- No, that´s just the end of round one.

965
02:03:21,468 --> 02:03:23,437
Come, keep away, keep away!

966
02:03:30,844 --> 02:03:36,684
Whiskey? No, that´ll be too warm, 
it´ll get your blood up. Porter is the very thing.

967
02:03:36,917 --> 02:03:41,255
- Ah, it´s peaceful and quiet in here, isn´t it? 
- Yeah.

968
02:03:41,455 --> 02:03:43,157
You know...

969
02:03:45,926 --> 02:03:48,395
This has been a fight I´d come a long way to see.

970
02:03:48,595 --> 02:03:51,198
I hope you can stick around for the finish.

971
02:03:52,599 --> 02:03:55,235
Don´t worry about that!

972
02:03:58,472 --> 02:04:04,144
- You know, Yank. I´ve taken quite a likin´ to you. 
- I´m gettin´ real fond of you, too.

973
02:04:05,112 --> 02:04:09,316
Your widow, me sister... She could´ve done a lot worse.

974
02:04:09,516 --> 02:04:11,485
- True, true. - Poor woman.

975
02:04:11,719 --> 02:04:15,389
- Thanks, fill them up again. 
- You buy me no drinks.

976
02:04:15,589 --> 02:04:20,060
- The drinks are on the house, sir. 
- I´m takin´ no drinks from you, squint.

977
02:04:20,260 --> 02:04:24,298
- I´m buyin´ the drinks. 
- You can buy me a drink at your wake.

978
02:04:24,498 --> 02:04:26,467
And not before.

979
02:04:28,602 --> 02:04:30,304
I´m buyin´!

980
02:04:34,675 --> 02:04:37,144
Bar towel!

981
02:04:40,914 --> 02:04:43,650
- What time is it? - Half past five, sir.

982
02:04:50,324 --> 02:04:51,592
Lord, he beat you!

983
02:05:01,735 --> 02:05:08,008
Why... I hope you won´t be vexed with me, 
but I´ve lost three pounds to Mrs Delany.

984
02:05:08,242 --> 02:05:10,811
I know I shouldn´t have bet but...

985
02:05:11,045 --> 02:05:13,814
There you are, Stuffy, 15 pounds.

986
02:05:16,483 --> 02:05:20,254
- Hello there, Elizabeth. - Your lordship.

987
02:05:20,454 --> 02:05:25,459
- And what have you been doing all day? 
- If you´ll excuse me, I´ll...

988
02:05:25,659 --> 02:05:28,495
I´ll get your tea, Snuffy.

989
02:05:30,864 --> 02:05:34,935
# There was a wild colonial boy

990
02:05:35,135 --> 02:05:38,339
#Jack Duggan was his name

991
02:05:38,539 --> 02:05:42,676
# He was born and bred in Ireland

992
02:05:42,876 --> 02:05:46,647
# In a place called Castlemaine

993
02:05:46,847 --> 02:05:50,784
# He was his father´s only son

994
02:05:50,984 --> 02:05:54,488
# His mother´s pride and joy

995
02:05:54,688 --> 02:05:58,692
# And dearly did his parents love

996

# This wild colonial boy

997
02:06:14,708 --> 02:06:18,812
Woman of the house! I brought the brother home to supper.

998
02:06:20,114 --> 02:06:22,816
He´s kindly welcome.

999
02:06:24,051 --> 02:06:26,020
God bless all in this house.

1000
02:06:26,220 --> 02:06:28,088
- Wipe your feet. - Thank you, ma´am.

1001
02:06:28,288 --> 02:06:31,892
Sit down, sit down. That´s what chairs are for.

1002
02:06:37,097 --> 02:06:39,400
Hurry it up!

1003
02:06:46,540 --> 02:06:52,046
Well, then. So peace and quiet came once again to Inisfree,

1004
02:06:52,246 --> 02:06:55,616
and we were... Good heavens, what´s that woman up to now.?

1005
02:06:55,816 --> 02:06:59,219
Make way, she´ll be runnin´you down with that.!

1006
02:07:09,330 --> 02:07:12,866
When the Reverend Mr Playfair comes down,

1007
02:07:13,067 --> 02:07:16,670
I want us all to cheer like Protestants. Now, spread out!

(CROWD CHEERS)

1009

Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray!

1010
02:07:51,238 --> 02:07:57,277
No patty fingers, if you please. 
The proprieties at all times.

1011
02:07:59,146 --> 02:08:01,548
Hold on to your hats. Come on.
