1
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:29,680
Quiet, Mirza. Mirza, quiet now.

2
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:34,835
- Good afternoon, madame.
- Yes, what is it?

3
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:38,602
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was told about an apartment.

4
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:45,481
This is the right building, isn't it?

5
00:02:45,647 --> 00:02:47,399
Who told you?

6
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:52,118
A friend of mine.
Well, a relation, actually.

7
00:02:52,287 --> 00:02:54,323
The door.

8
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:57,840
I gather it's a small
two-room apartment?

9
00:02:58,007 --> 00:03:02,444
Think that's all I got to do? Some
people think a concierge is a slave.

10
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:07,044
Not me. Would it be more convenient
if I came back later?

11
00:03:07,207 --> 00:03:12,361
You have to speak with Monsieur Zy.
I can only show the apartment.

12
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:16,600
I don't want to be a nuisance,
but if it were at all possible,

13
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:21,887
and if I might offer you some
small compensation for your trouble,

14
00:03:22,047 --> 00:03:24,436
which is only reasonable.

15
00:03:28,447 --> 00:03:33,601
What a lovely little dog you... you are.
You're Mirza, aren't you?

16
00:03:34,207 --> 00:03:38,280
It's... It's a nice name, Mirza.

17
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:51,965
I'm sorry.

18
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:10,842
The previous tenant threw herself
out of the window.

19
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:15,561
You can still see where she fell.

20
00:05:16,807 --> 00:05:18,399
Look.

21
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:25,726
He's going to have to fix that.

22
00:05:27,207 --> 00:05:31,200
She's not dead yet,
though she might as well be.

23
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:34,325
She's in the Bretonneau Hospital.

24
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:36,876
What if she gets better?

25
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:41,882
Don't worry. She won't get better.
You're on to a good thing here.

26
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:45,039
Poor woman. What are the terms?

27
00:05:45,207 --> 00:05:48,483
There's a fee for water.
The plumbing is new.

28
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:50,638
The tap was on the landing.

29
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:55,881
- And the toilet?
- Over there. Go around the corridor.

30
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:58,845
That's a view worth looking at!

31
00:06:04,127 --> 00:06:06,197
How much is the premium?

32
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,961
The rent is 600 francs a month.

33
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:14,884
The premium I'm not sure about.
I think he wants 5,000 francs.

34
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:18,483
5,000? That's a lot of money.

35
00:06:18,647 --> 00:06:23,960
It's not my business. You'll have to talk
to Monsieur Zy. He lives down here.

36
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:28,635
I have to get back now.

37
00:06:58,807 --> 00:07:01,275
<i>All right, we're not deaf.</i>

38
00:07:02,887 --> 00:07:06,357
- We don't give to charity.
- It's about the apartment.

39
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:09,724
- What apartment?
- On the floor above.

40
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,447
Could I speak to Monsieur Zy?

41
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:42,759
Good afternoon.

42
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:58,727
- Have you seen the apartment?
- Yes. I wanted to discuss the terms.

43
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:03,640
5,000 premium, 600 a month.

44
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:08,437
That's a lot of money.
I couldn't pay more than 4,000.

45
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:16,605
- The concierge told you about the water.
- Yes, she did.

46
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:19,520
It's damned hard to find an apartment.

47
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:24,442
A student on the sixth floor gave me
half that for a single room.

48
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:28,202
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not criticising your apartment,

49
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:30,562
but the toilet is a problem.

50
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:34,686
Suppose I got sick, which I don't
often do, I can assure you,

51
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:40,479
and I had to relieve myself in the night.
It wouldn't be very convenient.

52
00:08:40,647 --> 00:08:45,402
On the other hand, I could pay you
the 4,000 right away in cash.

53
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:50,277
It's not only a question of money,
let's be clear about that, monsieur...

54
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,438
Trelkovsky.

55
00:08:52,607 --> 00:08:54,518
Trelkovsky.

56
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:57,884
I won't exactly starve
without your 5,000.

57
00:08:58,047 --> 00:09:02,802
I'm renting the apartment because it's
vacant. They don't grow on trees.

58
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:07,165
Of course. It's perfectly reasonable.
I understand your point.

59
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,557
Could I offer you a cigarette?

60
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:15,438
You want 5,000, fine. But if you got paid
by cheque, you'd have to declare it.

61
00:09:15,607 --> 00:09:18,804
Wouldn't you rather get 4,000 in cash?

62
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:22,164
I'd rather get 5,000 in cash.

63
00:09:24,487 --> 00:09:29,800
It's perfectly natural. Anyway,
the former tenant is not dead yet.

64
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:34,006
If she comes back, you won't even
get 4,000. You get nothing.

65
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:38,365
Are you married? Excuse the question,
but it's because of children.

66
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:42,725
This is a very quiet building.
My wife and I are getting on now.

67
00:09:42,887 --> 00:09:44,923
I wouldn't say that, Monsieur Zy.

68
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:49,524
I know what I'm saying. My wife and I
are getting on. We don't like noise.

69
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:53,202
You needn't worry.
I'm very quiet and I'm a bachelor.

70
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:57,360
Bachelors can be a problem, too.

71
00:09:57,527 --> 00:10:00,519
If you want a place to entertain girls,

72
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:03,918
I'd rather take 2,000 and give it
to someone more needy.

73
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:06,442
I quite agree, but I'm not that type.

74
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:12,520
I can't give you a definite answer while
Mademoiselle Choule is still alive.

75
00:10:12,687 --> 00:10:17,477
But I like you. You seem to be
a serious young man to me.

76
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:36,120
I want to visit Mademoiselle Choule.

77
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:46,599
Simone Choule?

78
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:49,600
- Are you a relative?
- I'm a friend.

79
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:03,237
Can I help you?

80
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:05,602
- Are you the head nurse?
- Yes.

81
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:11,205
Good. I was told at reception to see you
first. It's about Mademoiselle Choule.

82
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:14,165
- Bed 18.
- May I see her?

83
00:11:14,327 --> 00:11:18,366
She's not to be disturbed.
She was in a coma until yesterday.

84
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:21,678
Go ahead, but don't try to talk to her.

85
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:58,286
He said he'd come by Wednesday...

86
00:11:58,447 --> 00:12:00,961
Are you a friend of hers?

87
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:03,319
Excuse me.

88
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:13,759
I can't believe it. I just can't believe it.

89
00:12:13,927 --> 00:12:18,921
I was with her the night before.
No, two nights before.

90
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:21,601
She was in such good spirits.

91
00:12:23,127 --> 00:12:25,436
Why would she do a thing like that?

92
00:12:25,607 --> 00:12:29,885
To tell you the truth, I'm not close.
I hardly know her.

93
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:34,279
But believe me, I'm terribly upset
about what's happened.

94
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:37,484
It's awful.

95
00:12:38,727 --> 00:12:40,604
Simone?

96
00:12:41,047 --> 00:12:42,799
Simone?

97
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:46,005
You do recognise me, don't you?

98
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:47,964
It's me. Stella.

99
00:12:48,887 --> 00:12:53,756
Your friend Stella.
Don't you recognise me?

100
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:04,917
You'll have to leave now.

101
00:13:05,087 --> 00:13:07,123
Your bag.

102
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,437
Is there any hope of saving her?

103
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:12,485
If we can save her, we save her.

104
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:40,122
Careful.
You mustn't give in to your grief.

105
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:48,922
If you like, we could have something
to drink. I think it would help you.

106
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:51,203
There is a...

107
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:00,926
Here.

108
00:14:10,887 --> 00:14:13,242
What would you like to drink?

109
00:14:14,727 --> 00:14:16,604
I don't know.

110
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:19,884
I'll have a beer. No, a coffee.

111
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:23,881
- Coffee. And the lady?
- I don't want a coffee.

112
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:27,323
Have something strong.
It will pick you up.

113
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:29,921
I'll have a small glass of Beaujolais.

114
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:33,875
Small glass of Beaujolais
and... a martini.

115
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:36,925
- No coffee?
- No, no. A martini.

116
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:44,484
I forgot. I have a phone call to make.

117
00:14:44,647 --> 00:14:47,115
I'll be right back.

118
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:07,483
- Come here.
- All right, I'm coming.

119
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:11,647
I'll never understand suicide.

120
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:18,475
I have no argument against it
but it's beyond my comprehension.

121
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:21,161
Did you ever discuss it with her?

122
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:23,159
Never.

123
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:26,967
I just can't believe it.

124
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:31,085
It's terrible. Terrible.

125
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,280
It's terrible.

126
00:15:33,447 --> 00:15:37,759
Could it have been a disappointment
in love? Something like that?

127
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:41,761
- Who with?
- I don't know. Some man.

128
00:15:41,927 --> 00:15:45,124
You know she wasn't interested in men.

129
00:15:45,287 --> 00:15:48,199
Yes, I know, but...

130
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:52,280
Women as sensitive as she was,
she is, I mean,

131
00:15:52,447 --> 00:15:58,363
tend to have much more complicated
relationships than they seem to.

132
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:02,605
Perhaps she will pull out of it anyway.

133
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:04,962
I doubt it.

134
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:09,195
Did you notice that she didn't
even recognise me?

135
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:12,919
A tragedy.

136
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:20,000
Hey, man. Got any bread for an artist?

137
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:27,720
- I don't have any change.
- I don't care. I'll take what you got.

138
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,684
I've only got notes.

139
00:16:29,847 --> 00:16:33,123
Don't look cheap
in front of your girlfriend.

140
00:16:34,087 --> 00:16:36,078
Not a word of thanks.

141
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:41,037
I don't like tramps. You shouldn't
have given him anything.

142
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:21,082
- Would you like to have a drink?
- No. Thanks.

143
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:24,637
Right. Goodbye then.

144
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:27,275
- Goodbye.
- Hope to see you soon.

145
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:48,960
- What is it?
- Just came over from CNMA.

146
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:51,846
- Was it sent by Monsieur Lott?
- Right.

147
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:56,080
- That must be the Villa LeDuc.
- Yes, that's right.

148
00:18:56,247 --> 00:19:00,160
Yes, that's the Villa LeDuc.
"Unmounted number 2601.

149
00:19:00,327 --> 00:19:05,959
"Make a detailed copy of spire as
indicated in the lower left-hand corner."

150
00:19:06,127 --> 00:19:08,800
You have to do it by next Thursday.

151
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:47,279
I'm calling to ask if you have
any news about Simone Choule.

152
00:19:47,447 --> 00:19:50,280
- <i>What department is she in?</i>
- Surgery?

153
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:54,406
- <i>Choule? With a C?</i>
- That's right. Simone Choule.

154
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:59,402
- <i>Are you a relative?</i>
- No. I'm a friend.

155
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:02,877
<i>The patient died at 4.20 p.m. Yesterday.</i>

156
00:20:05,447 --> 00:20:07,165
Thank you.

157
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:11,000
Yes... Goodbye.

158
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:23,923
- Morning, monsieur.
- Morning.

159
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:27,557
- Live opposite?
- Yes. I just moved in.

160
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:32,278
You rented the apartment of that girl
that jumped out of the window?

161
00:24:32,447 --> 00:24:34,563
Yes. Did you know her?

162
00:24:34,727 --> 00:24:36,957
Sure I did. Came in every morning.

163
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:41,484
Always sat in the same place,
right there where you are now.

164
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,605
A cup of chocolate and a roll.
Never coffee.

165
00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:48,726
She'd say, "If I have a coffee
I can't sleep for two days."

166
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:52,436
- It's a question of habit.
- Would you like a chocolate?

167
00:24:52,607 --> 00:24:54,723
A question of temperament, too.

168
00:24:54,887 --> 00:24:58,926
A young girl like that killing herself.
I can't imagine why.

169
00:24:59,727 --> 00:25:05,836
No reason at all, probably. A moment
of depression and wham, it's all over.

170
00:25:08,647 --> 00:25:10,365
Robert.

171
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:38,283
- Do you sell cigarettes?
- Yes. What would you like?

172
00:25:38,447 --> 00:25:41,917
- Gauloises bleues, please.
- I'm out of Gauloises.

173
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:44,601
- What else?
- Gitanes and Marlboro.

174
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:48,601
Mademoiselle Choule smoked
Marlboro. Would you like a pack?

175
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:51,235
No. No, thank you.

176
00:26:29,007 --> 00:26:33,444
Simone Choule, the Lord
has taken thee to His bosom,

177
00:26:33,607 --> 00:26:37,441
just as the shepherd brings in
his sheep at the close of day.

178
00:26:37,607 --> 00:26:40,997
What could be more natural,
of greater consolation?

179
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:47,242
Is it not our fondest hope that we shall
one day rejoin the flock of holy ones?

180
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:50,638
Hope of eternal life, the true life,

181
00:26:50,807 --> 00:26:54,038
shorn of all worldly cares,

182
00:26:54,207 --> 00:26:57,961
face to face in eternal blessedness
with Almighty God,

183
00:26:58,127 --> 00:27:01,005
who through His servant,
our Lord Jesus Christ,

184
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:03,840
died for us on the cross,

185
00:27:04,007 --> 00:27:07,556
who deigns to look down
upon us poor mortal creatures,

186
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:10,116
full of love, infinitely merciful,

187
00:27:10,287 --> 00:27:14,565
the sick, the suffering, the dying.

188
00:27:14,727 --> 00:27:17,116
Yes, the dying.

189
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:19,084
The icy tomb.

190
00:27:19,247 --> 00:27:22,557
Thou shalt return to the dust
from whence thou came

191
00:27:22,727 --> 00:27:24,718
and only thy bones remain.

192
00:27:24,887 --> 00:27:27,765
The worms shall consume thine eyes,

193
00:27:27,927 --> 00:27:30,361
thy lips, thy mouth.

194
00:27:30,527 --> 00:27:34,600
They shall enter into thine ears,
they shall enter into thy nostrils.

195
00:27:34,767 --> 00:27:38,077
Thy body shall putrefy
unto its innermost recesses

196
00:27:38,247 --> 00:27:40,966
and shall give off a noisome stench.

197
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:46,042
Yea, Christ has ascended into heaven
and joined the host of angels on high.

198
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:50,041
But not for creatures like you,
full of the basest vice,

199
00:27:50,207 --> 00:27:53,040
yearning only for carnal satisfaction.

200
00:27:54,247 --> 00:27:58,957
How dare you pester me
and mock at me to my very face?

201
00:27:59,127 --> 00:28:03,803
What audacity! What are you doing
here in my temple?

202
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:06,356
The graveyard is where you belong.

203
00:28:06,527 --> 00:28:12,045
Thou shalt stink like some
putrefied corpse lying on the wayside.

204
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:17,437
Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt
never enter into my kingdom.

205
00:28:24,887 --> 00:28:28,880
Four, three, two, one, zero! Our hero.

206
00:28:29,047 --> 00:28:32,642
There he is!
Hey, Trelkovsky. The lucky lodger.

207
00:28:32,807 --> 00:28:37,676
- Lucille Pampin from Nice.
- On the Riviera. Best blow job in Paris.

208
00:28:38,647 --> 00:28:41,605
- Very pleased to meet you.
- How do you do?

209
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:45,082
What, no more chairs? What a dump!

210
00:28:45,247 --> 00:28:47,522
There is a table, right here.

211
00:28:47,687 --> 00:28:51,043
Your fiancée can come sit on my knees.

212
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:54,882
It's against my principles.
Give me a hand.

213
00:28:55,727 --> 00:28:57,957
Grab that end, will you?

214
00:28:58,127 --> 00:29:00,243
Careful, huh?

215
00:29:01,887 --> 00:29:05,436
- Put it right in the middle.
- That's it. Much nicer.

216
00:29:05,607 --> 00:29:10,044
There's a bed here. Let's use that.
Move that table over.

217
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:12,163
Get the table out of there.

218
00:29:12,887 --> 00:29:15,879
- Want me to do anything?
- Thank you.

219
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:19,960
- Let me finish that.
- Just get this salad finished.

220
00:29:20,127 --> 00:29:23,483
- Have you met Viviane?
- Hello.

221
00:29:23,647 --> 00:29:25,638
Hurry up. It weighs a ton.

222
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:28,879
- Set her down.
- Easy does it.

223
00:29:29,487 --> 00:29:31,842
What the hell is this?

224
00:29:36,047 --> 00:29:38,436
Is that one of yours?

225
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:44,517
Oh, no, cut it out.
He's got a heart of gold.

226
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:49,242
- How about you?
- No, I hadn't planned. I know.

227
00:29:49,407 --> 00:29:51,398
He's got the heart of a chick.

228
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:53,717
You'd do it for a little bread.

229
00:29:53,887 --> 00:29:58,403
I wouldn't. You could offer me
a fortune, I still wouldn't dream of it.

230
00:29:58,567 --> 00:30:02,640
You think there's anyone dumb enough
to offer you a fortune?

231
00:30:02,807 --> 00:30:05,241
She's talking about the principle, jerk.

232
00:30:05,407 --> 00:30:08,479
You know what I think
of your principles?

233
00:30:08,647 --> 00:30:12,162
- What do you think?
- It's a lot of crap.

234
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:14,682
I tell you, I'd do it for nothing.

235
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:17,964
- Absolutely nothing.
- It takes all kinds.

236
00:30:18,127 --> 00:30:22,120
Nobody wants me to,
but I'd pay them to let me.

237
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:25,723
I saw one once.
Makes you want to throw up.

238
00:30:25,887 --> 00:30:30,722
- Can we change the subject?
- And talk about women's lib?

239
00:30:30,887 --> 00:30:33,082
Keep women's lib out of it.

240
00:30:33,247 --> 00:30:37,957
Have you looked at those militants?
It's enough to turn you queer.

241
00:30:39,847 --> 00:30:44,796
Look at that pig. He's actually
pissing in the sink. How revolting!

242
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:50,678
Get off my back. It's not my fault there's
no john in this crummy apartment.

243
00:31:14,407 --> 00:31:19,435
- Monsieur?
- You're making a great deal of noise.

244
00:31:19,607 --> 00:31:23,759
It's after one o'clock.
You're making a great deal of noise.

245
00:31:23,927 --> 00:31:26,157
We're just having a quiet chat.

246
00:31:26,327 --> 00:31:31,276
Quiet? I live upstairs and I can hear
every word you're saying.

247
00:31:31,447 --> 00:31:35,804
You've been dragging furniture around,
stamping all over the place.

248
00:31:35,967 --> 00:31:39,642
It's intolerable. Do you intend
to carry on much longer?

249
00:31:39,807 --> 00:31:42,116
Who is that asshole?

250
00:31:46,527 --> 00:31:48,279
Look...

251
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:54,237
I'm terribly sorry I woke you.
I'll be more careful from now on.

252
00:31:54,407 --> 00:31:58,195
You don't seem to give a damn
about anyone else.

253
00:31:58,887 --> 00:32:03,722
It's all very well to have a good time
but some people have to work.

254
00:32:04,407 --> 00:32:10,039
Tomorrow's Sunday. It's reasonable to
have company on a Saturday evening.

255
00:32:10,207 --> 00:32:14,519
No, monsieur. It's not reasonable
to make such a racket,

256
00:32:14,687 --> 00:32:17,360
even on a Saturday evening!

257
00:32:20,687 --> 00:32:23,326
We'll be more careful. Goodnight.

258
00:32:32,927 --> 00:32:37,876
Soon you won't even be able to jerk off
without him knocking on the door.

259
00:32:38,327 --> 00:32:42,366
- Don't let him push you around.
- You should counter-attack.

260
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:46,486
- We've got to take revenge.
- Let's set the joint on fire.

261
00:32:46,647 --> 00:32:50,401
- Throw scorpions down his chimney.
- Or crabs.

262
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:54,162
We'll drill a hole in the wall
and force gas into it.

263
00:32:54,327 --> 00:32:56,602
Make a hole in the floor.

264
00:32:56,767 --> 00:33:00,316
- You're such a moron.
- He only thinks below the belt.

265
00:33:00,487 --> 00:33:04,400
- He's throwing us out of the house.
- It's late.

266
00:33:06,447 --> 00:33:09,678
- Meanie!
- Let's find someplace else.

267
00:33:09,847 --> 00:33:13,157
- Let's go.
- Somebody pass me my coat.

268
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:16,763
- Be careful.
- Come on, on your feet.

269
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:19,202
Let's go, everybody.

270
00:33:22,687 --> 00:33:25,759
- Goodbye, everybody.
- Come on, everyone.

271
00:33:25,927 --> 00:33:27,406
Goodnight.

272
00:33:28,407 --> 00:33:31,717
- Everybody out.
- One hell of a party.

273
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:33,718
Goodnight, my friend!

274
00:33:40,487 --> 00:33:44,002
Don't make so much noise.
People are sleeping.

275
00:36:00,047 --> 00:36:03,596
Good morning, Monsieur Zy.
Lovely day, isn't it?

276
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:10,406
I'm terribly embarrassed about last night.
I promise it won't happen again.

277
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:15,561
I hope not. You woke up both me and
my wife. We couldn't get back to sleep.

278
00:36:15,727 --> 00:36:18,036
What was the meaning of all that?

279
00:36:18,207 --> 00:36:21,279
I thought I'd have a few friends over

280
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:26,726
to celebrate my good fortune in
having found this lovely apartment,

281
00:36:26,887 --> 00:36:31,324
as sort of a housewarming,
without disturbing anyone.

282
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:33,682
And then, you know how it is.

283
00:36:33,847 --> 00:36:36,919
With the best will in the world,

284
00:36:37,087 --> 00:36:39,362
not dreaming of disturbing anyone,

285
00:36:39,527 --> 00:36:42,246
you talk, you're having a good time.

286
00:36:42,407 --> 00:36:47,162
Before you know it,
you're making so much noise that...

287
00:36:47,327 --> 00:36:51,605
I'm sorry. I can promise you
it will never happen again.

288
00:36:51,767 --> 00:36:54,679
I'm glad to hear that,
Monsieur Trelkovsky.

289
00:36:54,847 --> 00:36:58,237
Because I was seriously thinking
of taking steps.

290
00:36:58,407 --> 00:37:04,323
Apartments are hard to come by,
so it's worth keeping the one you have.

291
00:38:38,527 --> 00:38:43,282
"Outraged neighbour shoots tipsy tenor
for singing <i>La Tosca</i> at 3 a.m.

292
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:48,601
"Louis Marais, aged 39, bachelor,
came home after one drink too many

293
00:38:48,767 --> 00:38:52,123
"and proceeded to sing opera
with his windows wide open.

"The murderer is under arrest."

299
00:39:16,007 --> 00:39:18,680
You there! Quiet down!

300
00:39:19,207 --> 00:39:23,246
How much longer are
you gonna keep up this racket?

301
00:42:44,407 --> 00:42:46,284
Who is it?

302
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:48,119
<i>It's me.</i>

303
00:42:58,127 --> 00:43:02,882
- What can I do for you?
- Did you register the complaint?

304
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:06,198
Complaint? Against whom?

305
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:09,359
Against me for causing
a disturbance at night.

306
00:43:09,527 --> 00:43:11,882
I never made any complaint.

307
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:16,598
Someone has registered a complaint.
It came this morning.

308
00:43:16,767 --> 00:43:19,884
She's the one who makes noise all night.

309
00:43:20,047 --> 00:43:23,926
- Who?
- That old woman. She's evil.

310
00:43:24,087 --> 00:43:27,841
She's done all she could
to make things difficult for us,

311
00:43:28,007 --> 00:43:30,567
just because the girl is disabled.

312
00:43:33,127 --> 00:43:36,483
- You didn't register a complaint?
- Of course not.

313
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,717
It must have been her.

314
00:43:38,927 --> 00:43:42,442
I asked downstairs.
They said it might have been you.

315
00:43:42,607 --> 00:43:45,519
We go to bed early, not like her.

316
00:43:45,687 --> 00:43:51,125
She can't sleep at night so she walks
up and down her apartment,

317
00:43:51,287 --> 00:43:53,721
moves the furniture around.

318
00:43:53,887 --> 00:43:56,640
She keeps me and my daughter awake.

319
00:43:56,807 --> 00:43:59,082
Do you know what she did, monsieur?

320
00:43:59,247 --> 00:44:02,080
Jammed a broom against my door.

321
00:44:02,247 --> 00:44:06,160
I had to heave it open
with all my strength.

322
00:44:06,327 --> 00:44:11,401
I twisted a muscle in my shoulder.
She wants to have us thrown out.

323
00:44:11,567 --> 00:44:14,923
She can't have you thrown out.

324
00:44:15,087 --> 00:44:18,238
I never make any noise,
monsieur, honestly.

325
00:44:18,407 --> 00:44:22,036
Even if you did,
they can't throw you out like that.

326
00:44:22,207 --> 00:44:25,358
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

327
00:44:29,807 --> 00:44:31,957
God bless you.

328
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:35,437
God bless you, monsieur. Thank you.

329
00:44:45,967 --> 00:44:49,277
- What about your neighbours?
- I'm getting used to them.

330
00:44:49,447 --> 00:44:54,726
It's a question of habit. They have
to get used to me too, you know.

331
00:44:57,127 --> 00:45:01,086
If they keep bugging you, Simon and I
know a few ways of dealing with them.

332
00:45:01,247 --> 00:45:03,522
- Eh, Simon?
- We know some great tricks.

333
00:45:03,687 --> 00:45:07,839
We could come around at night
and yell up at you from the courtyard.

334
00:45:08,007 --> 00:45:12,239
Hey, Trelkovsky, come out for a drink!
Get moving!

335
00:45:12,407 --> 00:45:15,843
Or we could knock on the floor below
after midnight.

336
00:45:16,007 --> 00:45:20,922
And shout, "On your feet, shitface,
we're off to the park for a blow job."

337
00:45:22,647 --> 00:45:24,603
You know...

338
00:45:28,207 --> 00:45:31,995
There is something odd
going on in my building.

339
00:45:32,967 --> 00:45:37,324
I see people in the toilets,
on the other side of the courtyard...

340
00:45:37,487 --> 00:45:39,284
What are you? A peeping Tom?

341
00:45:39,447 --> 00:45:43,281
People together in the shithouse?
Like an orgy?

342
00:45:43,447 --> 00:45:47,645
No, they just stand there for hours,
you know?

343
00:45:47,807 --> 00:45:50,196
Absolutely dead still.

344
00:45:50,367 --> 00:45:53,837
- They're playing with themselves.
- Not at all.

345
00:45:54,007 --> 00:45:58,683
They stand dead still. Can you
play with yourself without moving?

346
00:46:07,887 --> 00:46:09,957
- Drink?
- What are you having?

347
00:46:10,127 --> 00:46:12,516
- Beer.
- Beer's fine.

348
00:46:39,727 --> 00:46:43,117
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Just...

349
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:46,806
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

350
00:46:50,287 --> 00:46:55,042
- Turn it down a little.
- Leave it alone. They're used to it.

351
00:46:55,207 --> 00:46:57,437
But it's too loud even for us.

352
00:46:57,607 --> 00:47:01,566
Try and get used to it.
Try to enjoy it while you can.

353
00:47:01,727 --> 00:47:04,036
You can't do it at home.

354
00:47:16,527 --> 00:47:18,245
Neighbour?

355
00:47:18,407 --> 00:47:20,079
I hope so.

356
00:47:31,287 --> 00:47:35,360
Sorry to bother you, monsieur.
I see you have company.

357
00:47:35,527 --> 00:47:40,123
But I wonder, could you turn down
the sound a little? My wife's sick.

358
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:46,078
She's sick, is she? What am I supposed
to do? Stop living because of her?

359
00:47:46,247 --> 00:47:49,319
If she's sick, why doesn't she go
to a hospital?

360
00:47:49,487 --> 00:47:53,480
I'll play my records when I want
and as loud as I want.

361
00:47:53,647 --> 00:47:58,482
I'm a bit hard of hearing but that's
no reason to be deprived of my music.

362
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:06,802
And don't try anything funny.
I know the superintendent of police.

363
00:48:12,447 --> 00:48:15,962
See? That's how you deal with them.

364
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,436
- What if his wife?
- So?

365
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:21,565
I don't moan to him
when I don't feel well.

366
00:48:21,727 --> 00:48:25,606
He won't come back either.
I can promise you that.

367
00:48:43,647 --> 00:48:45,797
Just a moment, please.

368
00:50:40,567 --> 00:50:42,922
Who is it?

369
00:50:43,087 --> 00:50:46,159
<i>Is this Simone Choule's apartment?</i>

370
00:50:51,367 --> 00:50:53,085
Yes.

371
00:50:53,687 --> 00:50:56,042
It used to be. I'm the new tenant.

372
00:50:56,207 --> 00:50:58,277
Has she moved, then?

373
00:50:59,887 --> 00:51:03,243
Come in, please.
Don't stand there like that.

374
00:51:06,527 --> 00:51:09,041
Nothing's happened to her, I hope.

375
00:51:10,847 --> 00:51:15,602
- Please sit down, monsieur?
- Badar.

376
00:51:15,767 --> 00:51:19,726
Pleased to meet you, Monsieur Badar.
My name's Trelkovsky.

377
00:51:22,047 --> 00:51:26,040
I'm afraid there's been an unfortunate...

378
00:51:27,607 --> 00:51:29,837
Did you know her well?

379
00:51:31,647 --> 00:51:33,763
Did I know her?

380
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:36,680
She committed suicide.

381
00:51:36,847 --> 00:51:39,919
She threw herself out of the window.

382
00:51:40,287 --> 00:51:42,926
Would you like to see?

383
00:51:44,447 --> 00:51:47,962
Why... Why would she do a thing
like that?

384
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:50,842
No one seems to know.

385
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:55,683
Do you know Stella?
She doesn't know either.

386
00:51:57,087 --> 00:51:59,476
No one knows why she did it.

387
00:52:13,967 --> 00:52:18,643
I went back to the Egyptian department
at the Louvre this morning.

388
00:52:21,527 --> 00:52:24,678
I found a nice postcard
and I sent it to her.

389
00:52:26,007 --> 00:52:28,396
What irony!

390
00:52:28,567 --> 00:52:31,957
Years of affection without daring
to say anything.

391
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:36,006
I acted as though we were just friends
each time I saw her,

392
00:52:36,167 --> 00:52:39,398
which wasn't very often,
I can tell you that.

393
00:52:40,847 --> 00:52:43,122
It just isn't fair.

394
00:52:43,287 --> 00:52:47,041
The day I summon up
enough courage to tell her,

395
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:49,402
I find out...

396
00:52:49,567 --> 00:52:51,922
I find out she's...

397
00:52:57,527 --> 00:52:59,119
Why?

398
00:53:00,167 --> 00:53:02,727
Why didn't I ever tell her?

399
00:53:04,087 --> 00:53:07,523
She's gone without ever knowing it.

400
00:53:07,687 --> 00:53:10,076
We're closing, Monsieur Trelkovsky.

401
00:53:10,247 --> 00:53:12,681
Life isn't worth living any more.

402
00:53:12,847 --> 00:53:14,963
- You mustn't...
- Six francs 60.

403
00:53:15,127 --> 00:53:18,961
You mustn't think like that.
You're young, you'll forget.

404
00:53:20,527 --> 00:53:22,119
Wait.

405
00:53:24,487 --> 00:53:26,364
Wait a minute.

406
00:53:27,047 --> 00:53:28,639
Thank you.

407
00:53:38,247 --> 00:53:41,319
I can promise you she didn't suffer.

408
00:53:41,487 --> 00:53:44,001
And she didn't say anything?

409
00:53:44,767 --> 00:53:47,645
- You're sure?
- Absolutely certain.

410
00:53:48,407 --> 00:53:50,523
All right, all right.

411
00:53:52,167 --> 00:53:56,240
It's my round, for Chrissakes!
Drinks for everyone.

412
00:54:04,967 --> 00:54:07,322
Everyone except him.

413
00:54:20,247 --> 00:54:24,798
Don't mind him. He's drunk. Drunk.

414
00:54:24,967 --> 00:54:28,801
- What you've done for me...
- It's natural.

415
00:54:28,967 --> 00:54:33,199
- It's not natural. It's not natural at all.
- It is natural.

416
00:54:33,367 --> 00:54:38,236
There aren't many guys around
like you. It's as simple as this.

417
00:54:41,207 --> 00:54:43,402
You saved my life.

418
00:55:05,567 --> 00:55:08,001
- Morning.
- Good morning.

419
00:55:10,567 --> 00:55:13,081
Cup of chocolate, Monsieur Trelkovsky?

420
00:55:13,247 --> 00:55:15,158
Why not?

421
00:55:24,767 --> 00:55:27,998
- Gauloises bleues, please.
- Yes.

422
00:55:40,927 --> 00:55:42,997
I wanted some Gauloises.

423
00:55:43,167 --> 00:55:46,716
I thought you said Marlboro.
I've run out of Gauloises.

424
00:55:46,887 --> 00:55:50,357
Robert will be here soon.
I'll send him out for some.

425
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:53,166
Don't bother. I'll take the Marlboro.

426
00:57:09,327 --> 00:57:11,238
Yes, I know!

427
00:57:11,727 --> 00:57:13,957
I know I'm making a noise.

428
00:57:15,567 --> 00:57:19,355
You should have knocked before
when the thieves were here.

429
00:57:24,287 --> 00:57:26,721
Perhaps they did knock before.

430
00:57:35,567 --> 00:57:40,641
This can't go on any longer.
You kept everyone awake again.

431
00:57:40,807 --> 00:57:43,162
All the neighbours are complaining.

432
00:57:43,327 --> 00:57:45,682
Are you talking about last night?

433
00:57:45,847 --> 00:57:49,283
Of course I am.
You made a fiendish racket.

434
00:57:49,447 --> 00:57:53,520
I made it clear you wouldn't stay
for long if you behave like that.

435
00:57:53,687 --> 00:57:56,076
I shall be forced to take steps.

436
00:57:56,247 --> 00:58:00,923
I've been robbed, Monsieur Zy.
I'm on my way to the police station.

437
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:05,566
What do you mean?
My house is a respectable place.

438
00:58:05,727 --> 00:58:09,686
- If you're trying to get out of this...
- It's true.

439
00:58:09,847 --> 00:58:15,763
My television is gone, my camera,
one of my suitcases.

440
00:58:15,927 --> 00:58:17,565
I see.

441
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:23,279
Well, I'm very sorry for you,
but why are you going to the police?

442
00:58:25,167 --> 00:58:27,886
To tell them what happened.

443
00:58:28,047 --> 00:58:30,402
Now look, Monsieur Trelkovsky.

444
00:58:30,567 --> 00:58:34,082
- This is an honest house.
- There's no question...

445
00:58:34,247 --> 00:58:39,002
Let me finish. You know how careful
I am in choosing my tenants.

446
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:42,477
I let you have the apartment
because you seemed honest.

447
00:58:42,647 --> 00:58:46,003
Otherwise if you'd offered me
a million francs I'd have refused.

448
00:58:46,167 --> 00:58:48,317
If you go to the police,

449
00:58:48,487 --> 00:58:53,766
they'll come round asking all sorts
of questions, useless questions.

450
00:58:53,927 --> 00:58:58,079
All that can have a disastrous effect
on our reputation here.

451
00:58:58,247 --> 00:59:03,037
- I'm saying this for your sake, too.
- For my sake? What have I done?

452
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:08,486
Once anyone gets involved with the
police, they're looked on with suspicion,

453
00:59:08,647 --> 00:59:10,956
especially if they're not French.

454
00:59:11,127 --> 00:59:13,038
But I'm a French citizen.

455
00:59:13,207 --> 00:59:17,086
I know you've done nothing wrong,
but others won't know that.

456
00:59:17,247 --> 00:59:22,196
They'll suspect you of God knows what.
I know what I'm talking about.

457
00:59:22,367 --> 00:59:27,760
I know the superintendent of police.
I'll have a word with him about this.

458
00:59:27,927 --> 00:59:29,724
He'll know what to do.

459
00:59:31,047 --> 00:59:33,083
Oh... and by the way...

460
00:59:33,687 --> 00:59:38,238
The former tenant always wore
slippers after ten o'clock.

461
00:59:38,407 --> 00:59:41,240
It was much more comfortable for her.

462
00:59:44,327 --> 00:59:46,363
And for the neighbours.

463
00:59:49,047 --> 00:59:52,596
- A pack of Marlboro.
- Gimme a pack of Gauloises.

464
00:59:53,487 --> 00:59:55,796
A pack of Marlboro, please.

465
00:59:59,367 --> 01:00:01,642
There she was. She was in a ward...

466
01:00:02,647 --> 01:00:05,923
- A pack of Gauloises.
- One franc 60.

467
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:12,562
See you next week.

468
01:00:38,247 --> 01:00:40,681
Hello. How are you?

469
01:00:40,847 --> 01:00:43,759
Very well. I just came in for cigarettes.

470
01:00:43,927 --> 01:00:46,646
Come and join us. These are my friends.

471
01:00:46,807 --> 01:00:49,367
- May I?
- Of course.

472
01:00:49,767 --> 01:00:51,883
- Hi.
- Hi.

473
01:00:55,447 --> 01:00:57,722
We were just talking about Simone.

474
01:00:57,887 --> 01:01:01,038
- Simone?
- Simone Choule.

475
01:01:01,207 --> 01:01:05,439
This is the guy I told you about,
the one I met at the hospital.

476
01:01:05,607 --> 01:01:08,644
We were the last to see her alive.

477
01:01:08,807 --> 01:01:12,356
Stella told us
Simone didn't seem to know her.

478
01:01:12,527 --> 01:01:15,360
- I don't think she did.
- And you?

479
01:01:15,527 --> 01:01:19,156
- Me?
- She didn't recognise you either?

480
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:25,638
It's hard to say. I couldn't be sure
one way or the other.

481
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:30,835
Maybe she was trying to say something
when she screamed like that.

482
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:35,364
Anyway, that's the impression I get
when I think back on it.

483
01:01:37,007 --> 01:01:41,000
She was looking at you
when she let out that cry.

484
01:01:42,167 --> 01:01:44,442
- You think so?
- You know...

485
01:01:44,607 --> 01:01:48,998
I still have some things of hers
at home. It's depressing.

486
01:01:49,167 --> 01:01:53,206
- What have you got of hers?
- Some books, a couple of records.

487
01:02:00,087 --> 01:02:02,396
There's one of Simone's books.

488
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:12,556
- I haven't read it.
- Nor have I.

489
01:02:12,727 --> 01:02:15,002
I'm not interested in Egyptology.

490
01:02:15,167 --> 01:02:19,285
She left it behind one evening.
You can have it if you like.

491
01:02:19,447 --> 01:02:22,883
Oh, you're very kind.
I would love to read it.

492
01:02:27,407 --> 01:02:32,686
It's a magnificent place you've got here.
Better than where I live.

493
01:02:35,607 --> 01:02:39,680
If you don't mind me asking,
is the rent very high?

494
01:02:39,847 --> 01:02:43,157
I don't pay for it.
It belongs to my brother.

495
01:02:43,327 --> 01:02:49,641
He's gone off to Peru
for a few months, a year, travelling.

496
01:02:55,287 --> 01:02:58,040
Do you have trouble
with your neighbours?

497
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:01,597
- What sort of trouble?
- You know...

498
01:03:01,767 --> 01:03:07,444
These days, relationships with
neighbours can get quite complicated.

499
01:03:07,607 --> 01:03:13,842
You know, little things that get
blown up out of all proportion.

500
01:03:14,007 --> 01:03:16,919
- You know what I mean?
- No.

501
01:03:17,367 --> 01:03:19,358
No, I don't.

502
01:03:19,527 --> 01:03:21,916
I mind my own business.

503
01:03:24,887 --> 01:03:27,720
So do I. It's the best way.

504
01:03:30,127 --> 01:03:32,641
If you like, I'll take you home after.

505
01:03:51,167 --> 01:03:53,920
Shall we go back to your place?

506
01:03:54,487 --> 01:03:56,603
My place?

507
01:04:01,887 --> 01:04:03,479
OK?

508
01:04:03,647 --> 01:04:05,842
Sure, fine.

509
01:04:07,407 --> 01:04:10,319
Only my place is a bit...

510
01:04:11,367 --> 01:04:15,963
It's a bit difficult.
In fact, it's impossible.

511
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:19,324
Why? Have you got a girlfriend?

512
01:04:20,847 --> 01:04:22,997
Not exactly.

513
01:04:23,167 --> 01:04:27,922
It's just that I've been repainting
and the place is in chaos.

514
01:04:28,087 --> 01:04:29,679
Chaos.

515
01:04:29,847 --> 01:04:33,601
We could still spend
a couple of hours there.

516
01:04:33,767 --> 01:04:37,999
On top of that,
my uncle is just up from the country,

517
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:40,317
staying a few days.

518
01:04:44,567 --> 01:04:46,523
How about your place?

519
01:04:54,927 --> 01:04:56,918
Take off your coat.

520
01:05:09,007 --> 01:05:11,077
I'll be right back.

521
01:05:33,807 --> 01:05:35,638
I'd love something to drink.

522
01:05:42,247 --> 01:05:43,839
Cheers.

523
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:46,799
Cheers.

524
01:05:55,167 --> 01:06:00,400
Why don't you take your tie off?
You look like you're choking to death.

525
01:06:02,087 --> 01:06:05,966
I found a tooth in my apartment.
It was in a hole.

526
01:06:06,127 --> 01:06:08,038
A tooth?

527
01:06:09,567 --> 01:06:11,159
In a hole?

528
01:06:11,407 --> 01:06:12,840
Yeah.

529
01:06:13,007 --> 01:06:15,043
A hole in the wall.

530
01:06:15,607 --> 01:06:17,757
Wrapped in cotton wool.

531
01:06:17,927 --> 01:06:22,318
So? No need to pull such a long face
over a tooth.

532
01:06:23,607 --> 01:06:26,246
A bit weird though, isn't it?

533
01:06:27,847 --> 01:06:33,126
Not really. When I was young,
we did it all the time.

534
01:06:33,287 --> 01:06:37,758
Whenever one of my teeth fell out
I used to hide it.

535
01:06:38,847 --> 01:06:42,237
My mother said it would turn into a coin.

536
01:06:42,687 --> 01:06:44,200
Coin.

537
01:06:50,607 --> 01:06:52,518
Oh, God.

538
01:06:52,687 --> 01:06:55,360
- Stella, I was wondering...
- Yeah?

539
01:06:55,527 --> 01:06:57,757
A tooth...

540
01:06:59,327 --> 01:07:02,046
A tooth is a part of ourselves, isn't it?

541
01:07:02,207 --> 01:07:06,644
Like a... bit of our personality.

542
01:07:09,447 --> 01:07:12,007
I don't know what you mean.

543
01:07:13,967 --> 01:07:17,562
I remember in the newspaper,

544
01:07:17,727 --> 01:07:22,960
a man lost his arm in an accident
and wanted to have it buried.

545
01:07:23,127 --> 01:07:25,436
He wanted to do what?

546
01:07:25,607 --> 01:07:30,123
- Have it buried in the cemetery.
- He must have been nuts.

547
01:07:30,287 --> 01:07:36,203
The authorities refused. The arm
was cremated and that was that.

548
01:07:36,367 --> 01:07:39,040
Where did this happen? In France?

549
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:44,323
I wonder if they refused
to give him the ashes

550
01:07:44,487 --> 01:07:47,047
and if so, by what right?

551
01:07:48,127 --> 01:07:51,961
Haven't you got anything
more cheerful to talk about?

552
01:08:00,327 --> 01:08:02,795
All right, that'll do.

553
01:08:06,407 --> 01:08:08,204
Don't worry.

554
01:08:18,647 --> 01:08:20,603
Tell me...

555
01:08:20,767 --> 01:08:24,157
At what precise moment...

556
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:29,604
...does an individual
stop being who he thinks he is?

557
01:08:30,727 --> 01:08:33,958
You know, I don't like complications.

558
01:08:34,407 --> 01:08:39,117
Cut off my arm.
I say, "Me and my arm."

559
01:08:40,847 --> 01:08:45,557
You cut off my other arm.
I say, "Me and my two arms."

560
01:08:47,527 --> 01:08:50,564
You... take out...

561
01:08:50,727 --> 01:08:54,720
...take out my stomach, my kidneys,

562
01:08:54,887 --> 01:08:57,685
assuming that were possible...

563
01:08:58,487 --> 01:09:01,638
And I say, "Me and my intestines."

564
01:09:04,327 --> 01:09:06,079
Follow me?

565
01:09:09,647 --> 01:09:13,401
And now, if you cut off my head...

566
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:19,722
...would I say, "Me and my head"
or "Me and my body"?

567
01:09:22,447 --> 01:09:26,326
What right has my head to call itself me?

568
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,925
What right?

569
01:10:38,527 --> 01:10:40,085
Oh, God.

570
01:11:05,007 --> 01:11:06,884
Monsieur Trelkovsky?

571
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,917
Stay. Stay, Mirza, stay.

572
01:11:16,407 --> 01:11:18,523
You were out all night, huh?

573
01:11:19,407 --> 01:11:21,716
Yes, I...

574
01:11:22,007 --> 01:11:25,124
I had to stay with my uncle.
He isn't well.

575
01:11:26,247 --> 01:11:29,159
I'll tell Madame Dioz you're back.

576
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:32,717
Madame Dioz? Who's Madame Dioz?

577
01:11:34,567 --> 01:11:36,637
This isn't for me.

578
01:11:37,327 --> 01:11:38,806
Look.

579
01:11:52,687 --> 01:11:55,599
"Best wishes from the Louvre.

580
01:11:56,247 --> 01:11:58,238
"Georges Badar."

581
01:13:09,167 --> 01:13:12,159
I'd like to have a word
with you, monsieur.

582
01:13:12,327 --> 01:13:14,477
Please come in, madame.

583
01:13:16,087 --> 01:13:18,396
I am Madame Dioz.

584
01:13:21,247 --> 01:13:26,844
- I'm very pleased to meet you.
- This is why I'm here. Please read it.

585
01:13:27,007 --> 01:13:31,558
It is a petition against
the unspeakable Madame Gaderian.

586
01:13:31,727 --> 01:13:36,676
She's gone too far this time,
and we've got to do something about it.

587
01:13:36,847 --> 01:13:40,886
Look. Even Monsieur Zy
has signed. There.

588
01:13:41,047 --> 01:13:44,244
Who is Madame Gaderian?
I don't know her.

589
01:13:44,407 --> 01:13:48,798
You don't know her? Who do you think
makes all that dreadful noise?

590
01:13:48,967 --> 01:13:51,197
It is her, my dear young man.

591
01:13:51,367 --> 01:13:55,724
She does her washing up
in the middle of the night

592
01:13:55,887 --> 01:13:59,197
and she whistles at the same time.

593
01:13:59,367 --> 01:14:03,838
- Does a civilised person do that?
- I suppose not.

594
01:14:04,007 --> 01:14:07,716
Go on, then. Sign.
It's simply a question of solidarity.

595
01:14:07,887 --> 01:14:12,836
She's making life impossible
for... for the other tenants.

596
01:14:13,007 --> 01:14:17,478
Is she the one who lives
with a disabled daughter?

597
01:14:17,647 --> 01:14:19,797
Disabled? No.

598
01:14:19,967 --> 01:14:23,084
She has a boy, a horrible, noisy brat

599
01:14:23,247 --> 01:14:27,718
who's always playing skittles
or God knows what in the corridor.

600
01:14:27,887 --> 01:14:33,519
Are you sure? Are you absolutely
certain she doesn't have a daughter?

601
01:14:33,687 --> 01:14:37,760
I don't know what goes on in their lair.

602
01:14:37,927 --> 01:14:40,282
Ask the concierge.

603
01:14:43,887 --> 01:14:47,197
I'm sorry, I'm not signing any petition.

604
01:14:48,327 --> 01:14:50,887
This woman has never bothered me.

605
01:14:51,047 --> 01:14:54,278
I've never seen her
or even heard of her.

606
01:14:54,767 --> 01:14:57,964
What apartment does she live in?

607
01:14:58,127 --> 01:15:01,119
I shall make a note of your attitude.

608
01:15:01,287 --> 01:15:06,680
I see what this is. Everyone for
himself and never mind anyone else.

609
01:15:06,847 --> 01:15:10,396
- Not at all.
- I know your type exactly,

610
01:15:10,567 --> 01:15:15,004
like that man opposite, up until
he was struck down with paralysis.

611
01:15:15,167 --> 01:15:18,477
Then his neighbours let him
stew in his own juice.

612
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:23,118
By all means,
do whatever you think best.

613
01:15:23,287 --> 01:15:28,520
But I warn you,
don't come whining to me later.

614
01:15:35,167 --> 01:15:36,839
Bastards.

615
01:15:44,647 --> 01:15:47,605
What do you want me to do?
Drop dead?

616
01:15:51,927 --> 01:15:54,521
My wife is always...

617
01:16:05,007 --> 01:16:06,998
It's for me.

618
01:16:59,767 --> 01:17:01,723
It's no use playing innocent.

619
01:17:01,887 --> 01:17:05,880
I've heard a good deal about you,
Monsieur Trelkovsky.

620
01:17:06,047 --> 01:17:09,596
You specialise in
breaches of the peace at night.

621
01:17:09,767 --> 01:17:12,201
I'm quite amazed, Inspector.

622
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:15,681
No one has said anything to me.

623
01:17:17,807 --> 01:17:22,927
I'm not in the habit of making noise.
I have few friends and never entertain.

624
01:17:23,087 --> 01:17:27,365
I'm not interested in your stories.
I have other things to do.

625
01:17:27,527 --> 01:17:32,476
I keep receiving complaints and
it's my duty to maintain law and order.

626
01:17:32,647 --> 01:17:38,119
So I say it once and for all,
stop whatever it is you're doing at night.

627
01:17:39,247 --> 01:17:41,522
Trelkovsky. Is that a Russian name?

628
01:17:41,687 --> 01:17:43,598
Polish.

629
01:17:44,167 --> 01:17:48,240
- So you're not French?
- I'm a French citizen.

630
01:17:48,407 --> 01:17:51,126
Let me see your identity card.

631
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:04,316
It's in a very poor state.

632
01:18:05,527 --> 01:18:09,486
You haven't registered
your change of address.

633
01:18:09,647 --> 01:18:12,115
15 rue Sedan, where is this?

634
01:18:12,287 --> 01:18:15,723
I'm terribly sorry, I'll do it at once.

635
01:18:17,007 --> 01:18:19,441
You'll be well advised to.

636
01:18:19,607 --> 01:18:23,885
Right. This time I shall close my eyes
to the whole business.

637
01:18:24,047 --> 01:18:29,519
Make sure I don't hear about you again.
I won't have you disturbing the peace.

638
01:18:29,687 --> 01:18:31,882
Thank you very much, Inspector.

639
01:18:33,047 --> 01:18:34,560
Goodbye.

640
01:18:50,687 --> 01:18:52,518
Good afternoon, madame.

641
01:18:52,687 --> 01:18:57,238
I would like to know who registered
a complaint against me.

642
01:18:57,407 --> 01:18:59,762
Do you know who it was?

643
01:18:59,927 --> 01:19:04,318
If you didn't make so much noise
there wouldn't be any complaints.

644
01:19:04,487 --> 01:19:06,762
Was there a petition?

645
01:19:08,727 --> 01:19:14,040
Was it that woman that came to see
me the other day? Madame Dioz?

646
01:19:14,407 --> 01:19:17,524
You only have yourself to blame.

647
01:19:18,007 --> 01:19:19,998
Did you sign it?

648
01:19:53,367 --> 01:19:55,676
That's it. She's won.

649
01:19:55,847 --> 01:19:59,522
They've all signed it.
All except you, monsieur.

650
01:19:59,687 --> 01:20:02,247
Thank you. You're a good person.

651
01:20:02,847 --> 01:20:04,838
I don't like to get involved.

652
01:20:05,007 --> 01:20:09,125
Nonsense. You're a good person.
I can see it in your eyes.

653
01:20:10,807 --> 01:20:16,165
I got even with them. The concierge, too.
She's as bad as all of them.

654
01:20:16,327 --> 01:20:18,477
I paid them back, all right.

655
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:22,196
They gave me the idea.
Do you know what I did?

656
01:20:22,367 --> 01:20:27,282
I did it. On the staircase,
in front of everyone's door.

657
01:20:30,007 --> 01:20:33,682
It's their own fault.
They gave me the idea.

658
01:20:33,847 --> 01:20:38,841
I didn't do it by your door.
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

659
01:20:39,007 --> 01:20:41,919
- How long ago?
- Just now.

660
01:20:42,647 --> 01:20:46,640
I would love to see their faces
when they find out.

661
01:20:47,527 --> 01:20:51,884
- It serves them right, all of them.
- They'll say I did it.

662
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:54,515
Goodnight, monsieur. Sleep well.

663
01:26:08,607 --> 01:26:10,165
Hey, look.

664
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:14,802
They'll drive me to suicide.

665
01:27:21,807 --> 01:27:24,958
All right. I'll show them.

666
01:28:34,367 --> 01:28:36,597
Gorgeous shoes, my dear.

667
01:28:38,007 --> 01:28:41,966
So pretty. Where in the world
did you find them?

668
01:28:42,127 --> 01:28:44,243
Oh, it was... I don't know...

669
01:28:49,607 --> 01:28:51,996
80 francs, you're kidding.

670
01:28:52,167 --> 01:28:54,442
Supermarket, yes.

671
01:29:00,407 --> 01:29:03,365
She's not as young as she thinks she is.

672
01:29:07,847 --> 01:29:10,520
Beautiful, beautiful.

673
01:29:10,687 --> 01:29:12,166
Adorable.

674
01:29:14,287 --> 01:29:16,642
A goddess, divine.

675
01:29:17,247 --> 01:29:18,999
Divine.

676
01:29:31,967 --> 01:29:33,764
I think I'm pregnant.

677
01:31:06,887 --> 01:31:08,400
Monsters!

678
01:31:10,407 --> 01:31:12,159
Monsters!

679
01:31:12,327 --> 01:31:17,242
They'll never turn me
into Simone Choule. Never!

680
01:31:19,247 --> 01:31:20,999
Monsieur Trelkovsky.

681
01:31:23,647 --> 01:31:27,401
Do you remember the conditions
on which I let you move in?

682
01:31:27,567 --> 01:31:31,116
I do, Monsieur Zy.
May I know what you're referring to?

683
01:31:31,287 --> 01:31:34,757
- I'm referring to women.
- Oh, yes, of course.

684
01:31:35,127 --> 01:31:38,039
Then, why do you bring them here?

685
01:31:39,127 --> 01:31:42,517
What? I never brought any women here.

686
01:31:42,687 --> 01:31:48,478
I know you did. You had a woman
in your room. You can't deny it.

687
01:31:48,647 --> 01:31:51,286
I'll turn a blind eye to it this time.

688
01:31:51,447 --> 01:31:55,406
But this is the last time.
I hope that's clear.

689
01:32:03,767 --> 01:32:06,486
Good morning, Monsieur Trelkovsky.

690
01:32:18,087 --> 01:32:20,078
Bring me a coffee.

691
01:32:20,247 --> 01:32:23,125
- You don't want a chocolate?
- No, I want a coffee.

692
01:32:23,287 --> 01:32:27,360
- You always have a chocolate.
- You never ask me what I want.

693
01:32:27,527 --> 01:32:30,360
Today I'm telling you, I'd like a coffee.

694
01:32:39,847 --> 01:32:41,599
I'm sorry, but...

695
01:32:41,767 --> 01:32:44,076
The problem is, you see...

696
01:32:44,247 --> 01:32:46,715
The machine's broken down.

697
01:32:47,207 --> 01:32:50,483
- You won't have a chocolate?
- No! Why should I?

698
01:32:50,647 --> 01:32:53,036
Nothing to get sore about.

699
01:32:53,207 --> 01:32:55,926
I'll have... a glass of red wine.

700
01:32:56,087 --> 01:32:58,555
I suppose you're out of Gauloises.

701
01:32:58,727 --> 01:33:02,879
- That's right. We've only got Marlboros.
- You can keep them.

702
01:33:04,167 --> 01:33:06,283
I know just what you're up to.

703
01:33:06,447 --> 01:33:09,007
A gang of murderers!

704
01:33:10,767 --> 01:33:13,440
No good looking at me like that.

705
01:33:13,607 --> 01:33:16,883
I know exactly what
your little scheme is.

706
01:33:34,207 --> 01:33:37,005
- What's the matter?
- My boat.

707
01:33:37,167 --> 01:33:40,477
- Which one?
- The red one.

708
01:33:42,567 --> 01:33:46,242
Now, don't cry. What's your name?

709
01:33:46,407 --> 01:33:48,079
Patrick.

710
01:33:53,327 --> 01:33:56,558
And you've lost your boat, the red one?

711
01:33:57,447 --> 01:34:00,280
OK, I'll get it back for you.

712
01:34:09,407 --> 01:34:11,363
Filthy little brat.

713
01:35:34,247 --> 01:35:36,363
It's him! He's there!

714
01:36:21,727 --> 01:36:24,685
God! What's that?

715
01:36:24,847 --> 01:36:26,485
I'll fight.

716
01:36:28,487 --> 01:36:30,603
I'll fight to the bitter end.

717
01:39:29,527 --> 01:39:31,245
<i>Who is it?</i>

718
01:39:31,847 --> 01:39:34,156
It's me, Trelkovsky.

719
01:39:39,527 --> 01:39:41,643
Were you sleeping?

720
01:39:42,247 --> 01:39:44,283
What's the matter?

721
01:39:46,367 --> 01:39:49,518
Sorry to bother you
at this hour of the morning.

722
01:39:49,687 --> 01:39:53,600
Would you mind if I stayed here
for a while?

723
01:39:57,487 --> 01:39:59,443
You're strange.

724
01:40:00,847 --> 01:40:04,886
You must tell me, then.
I wouldn't mind, really.

725
01:40:06,967 --> 01:40:09,606
No, of course you can stay.

726
01:40:17,847 --> 01:40:19,485
Look, you're hurt.

727
01:40:19,647 --> 01:40:21,877
It's nothing, really.

728
01:40:25,207 --> 01:40:28,597
- But it's filthy.
- That's nothing.

729
01:40:28,767 --> 01:40:34,046
Wait. I think I've got some...
some things here.

730
01:40:51,607 --> 01:40:53,757
How did you do that?

731
01:40:53,927 --> 01:40:55,599
It's them.

732
01:40:56,367 --> 01:40:57,880
Who?

733
01:40:58,807 --> 01:41:01,275
They're trying to kill me.

734
01:41:03,847 --> 01:41:06,315
They'll drive me to suicide.

735
01:41:06,487 --> 01:41:11,003
What are you talking about?
Who's trying to kill you?

736
01:41:11,167 --> 01:41:13,965
Stella, I've been lying to you.

737
01:41:15,927 --> 01:41:18,441
I'm living in her apartment.

738
01:41:18,607 --> 01:41:20,723
Whose apartment?

739
01:41:20,887 --> 01:41:22,764
Simone's.

740
01:41:22,927 --> 01:41:26,283
I've rented Simone Choule's apartment.

741
01:41:27,447 --> 01:41:31,520
- How did you rent it?
- She's dead because of the neighbours.

742
01:41:32,327 --> 01:41:34,636
It was a plot.

743
01:41:34,807 --> 01:41:39,881
- Plot against Simone? You're insane.
- I'm not insane. Listen.

744
01:41:40,047 --> 01:41:42,720
They forced her to commit suicide.

745
01:41:42,887 --> 01:41:45,196
I can prove it.

746
01:41:45,567 --> 01:41:49,606
And they're trying to do
the same thing to me.

747
01:41:49,767 --> 01:41:53,476
Everything's ready.
They worked it all out, every detail.

748
01:41:53,647 --> 01:41:57,322
Do you know what
they've been doing to me?

749
01:41:59,047 --> 01:42:05,680
It's so appalling,
so incredible that I can hardly tell you.

750
01:42:05,847 --> 01:42:08,315
It's true, I swear it.

751
01:42:08,487 --> 01:42:11,445
Tell me. Tell me, I'm listening.

752
01:42:15,047 --> 01:42:19,882
They've been trying to turn me
into Simone Choule.

753
01:42:22,087 --> 01:42:24,362
There now. I'm your friend.

754
01:42:24,527 --> 01:42:28,122
- They're trying...
- I'll help you. Come now.

755
01:42:28,287 --> 01:42:31,199
- To turn me...
- You're exhausted.

756
01:42:31,367 --> 01:42:33,597
...into Simone Choule.

757
01:42:36,687 --> 01:42:40,760
I'll leave Paris in a couple of days.
They'll never find me.

758
01:42:40,927 --> 01:42:44,522
You're right, yes.
That's the best thing to do.

759
01:42:45,847 --> 01:42:48,202
You're the only one I can trust.

760
01:43:25,967 --> 01:43:28,322
It's me, Stella.

761
01:43:29,167 --> 01:43:31,237
Don't be frightened.

762
01:43:32,327 --> 01:43:35,319
You do recognise me, don't you?

763
01:43:38,527 --> 01:43:40,040
Sorry.

764
01:43:40,967 --> 01:43:42,958
I was having a nightmare.

765
01:43:43,127 --> 01:43:47,598
I must get to work now. I'm late.
I'll be back around eight.

766
01:43:47,767 --> 01:43:50,076
I left your breakfast ready.

767
01:43:50,727 --> 01:43:54,402
- I love you.
- And I love you.

768
01:43:56,887 --> 01:44:00,436
I even went out
and bought you some croissants.

769
01:44:01,767 --> 01:44:04,076
Please stay. Don't leave me alone.

770
01:44:04,247 --> 01:44:08,798
I'm late. If you want to go out,
just leave the keys under the mat.

771
01:44:08,967 --> 01:44:13,597
I'll have another pair made tomorrow.
We'll each have our own set then.

772
01:44:15,087 --> 01:44:18,477
- Please don't go.
- Don't be naughty now.

773
01:44:18,647 --> 01:44:22,117
You're to be good and stay here.

774
01:44:23,367 --> 01:44:29,124
There's everything you need. If you like,
you can go out and get some fresh air.

775
01:44:29,287 --> 01:44:32,723
I'll bring food back and we'll eat in

776
01:44:32,887 --> 01:44:38,007
or go out to a restaurant if you like.
We'll see how you feel.

777
01:44:39,367 --> 01:44:41,437
See you tonight, then.

778
01:45:42,167 --> 01:45:44,317
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

779
01:45:45,847 --> 01:45:47,803
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

780
01:46:13,807 --> 01:46:15,843
Filthy bitch.

781
01:46:17,327 --> 01:46:19,522
They're all in it together.

782
01:46:20,927 --> 01:46:23,316
They're all in it together!

783
01:46:27,607 --> 01:46:29,359
They're all in it...

784
01:46:36,207 --> 01:46:38,437
They're all in it together!

785
01:47:01,127 --> 01:47:03,880
- Stop here. Stop.
- Hey, what's wrong?

786
01:47:04,047 --> 01:47:06,561
Nothing. I'm getting out.

787
01:48:00,567 --> 01:48:03,206
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.

788
01:48:55,727 --> 01:48:58,799
Thank you, monsieur.
Thank you very much.

789
01:49:08,047 --> 01:49:13,679
Have you got any idea where I can
buy a gun? I'll pay good money.

790
01:49:13,847 --> 01:49:16,202
Get out of here, you little punk.

791
01:49:16,367 --> 01:49:20,565
- He wants to buy a gun, this bugger.
- What?

792
01:49:23,007 --> 01:49:25,521
I'll tell the cops, you little shit.

793
01:49:52,807 --> 01:49:56,641
I told you not to drive so fast.
Now look what's happened.

794
01:50:09,247 --> 01:50:11,283
Monsieur, are you hurt?

795
01:50:11,447 --> 01:50:14,519
People who can't drive should take taxis.

796
01:50:14,687 --> 01:50:18,077
How dare you? My wife hasn't had
an accident in 25 years.

797
01:50:18,247 --> 01:50:22,684
He's right. The guy walked right under
the wheels. I saw it all.

798
01:50:22,847 --> 01:50:26,886
Let me through, please.
Excuse me. Let me through.

799
01:50:27,047 --> 01:50:29,356
Excuse me, I'm a doctor.

800
01:50:50,487 --> 01:50:53,604
Murderers! Murderers!

801
01:50:53,767 --> 01:50:57,999
Believe me, my wife and I are
very upset about what's happened.

802
01:50:58,167 --> 01:51:00,397
Stand back. On the kerb.

803
01:51:00,567 --> 01:51:05,960
- Officer, this is how it happened...
- Your ID, please. Yours too, monsieur.

804
01:51:06,127 --> 01:51:08,641
You're very lucky.

805
01:51:08,807 --> 01:51:11,196
Only a few scratches.

806
01:51:11,367 --> 01:51:15,724
Nothing broken.
But you should have an X-ray.

807
01:51:20,607 --> 01:51:24,441
It's nothing serious.
It's a mild case of delirium tremens.

808
01:51:24,607 --> 01:51:28,839
These people have made a statement
and offered to drive him home.

809
01:51:29,007 --> 01:51:31,123
Or should I call an ambulance?

810
01:51:31,287 --> 01:51:34,006
If the gentleman can manage, it's fine.

811
01:51:34,167 --> 01:51:38,160
We'll be glad to give this poor man
a lift home, of course.

812
01:51:43,927 --> 01:51:46,395
We'll take you home, huh?

813
01:51:54,887 --> 01:51:57,526
That is preposterous. No, please!

814
01:51:57,687 --> 01:52:02,761
They were trying to kill me. They were
playing football with a human head.

815
01:52:02,927 --> 01:52:05,202
I'll give him a shot to calm him down.

816
01:52:06,527 --> 01:52:10,202
No injection. I don't want an injection.
I don't want...

817
01:52:12,327 --> 01:52:15,763
They tried... They tried to kill me.

818
01:53:16,327 --> 01:53:18,283
Mirza, quiet down.

819
01:53:21,967 --> 01:53:26,722
Good evening, madame. This
gentleman has had a slight accident.

820
01:53:26,887 --> 01:53:30,675
- Nothing serious.
- What did he do now?

821
01:53:30,847 --> 01:53:33,805
We'd better get him up to his apartment.

822
01:53:34,847 --> 01:53:36,485
How did it happen?

823
01:53:36,647 --> 01:53:40,481
He sort of jumped out
in front of the car.

824
01:53:40,647 --> 01:53:43,957
Luckily my wife
has very good reflexes.

825
01:53:45,967 --> 01:53:48,276
What's going on here?

826
01:53:49,087 --> 01:53:50,520
It's him again.

827
01:53:52,847 --> 01:53:54,963
Oh, you bastard!

828
01:56:05,807 --> 01:56:08,275
Stay. Stay, Mirza, stay.

829
01:56:23,487 --> 01:56:26,399
- What's that?
- Down in the courtyard.

830
01:56:50,847 --> 01:56:54,396
We'd better call an ambulance.
Go get one, quick.

831
01:56:55,687 --> 01:56:57,643
You shouldn't move.

832
01:57:01,687 --> 01:57:04,042
I swear I'm not Simone Choule.

833
01:57:04,207 --> 01:57:05,720
Quick, get him a blanket.

834
01:57:05,887 --> 01:57:09,800
- Murderer!
- Another suicide! It's unbelievable.

835
01:57:09,967 --> 01:57:13,846
Look how he's dressed.
He must be insane.

836
01:57:14,007 --> 01:57:17,317
And we just finished
repairing the roof.

837
01:57:17,487 --> 01:57:21,958
I knew there was something wrong
with him the first time I saw him.

838
01:57:25,967 --> 01:57:30,836
Oh, God, Monsieur Trelkovsky.
Be reasonable, wait for the ambulance.

839
01:57:48,087 --> 01:57:50,078
You gang of killers!

840
01:57:51,367 --> 01:57:53,676
I'll show you some blood.

841
01:57:56,367 --> 01:57:58,801
You wanted a clean death, didn't you?

842
01:57:58,967 --> 01:58:02,880
- Be reasonable.
- It's going to be dirty.

843
01:58:03,047 --> 01:58:04,958
Unforgettable.

844
01:58:05,127 --> 01:58:10,838
It was better last time, wasn't it?
Well, I'm not Simone Choule.

845
01:58:11,447 --> 01:58:13,324
I'm Trelkovsky.

846
01:58:14,967 --> 01:58:16,559
Trelkovsky.

847
01:58:24,127 --> 01:58:29,155
- All right, all right. What's goin' on?
- A tenant jumped out of the window.

848
01:58:29,327 --> 01:58:33,115
- Again? You're getting them wholesale.
- Where is he now?

849
01:58:33,287 --> 01:58:38,315
He's gone back up to his apartment.
I think he had some kind of a brainstorm.

850
01:58:38,487 --> 01:58:42,241
- He's gonna jump again!
- He's not gonna do it again?

851
01:58:42,407 --> 01:58:46,400
Take it easy. Don't move.
We'll come up and get you.

852
01:58:46,567 --> 01:58:48,762
Be reasonable now.

853
01:58:52,007 --> 01:58:53,565
Oh, God, no.

854
01:58:53,727 --> 01:58:57,481
Monsieur Trelkovsky,
don't do anything silly!

855
01:59:13,007 --> 01:59:15,237
Are you a friend of hers?

856
01:59:16,167 --> 01:59:17,725
I'm sorry.

857
01:59:20,447 --> 01:59:25,601
What on earth could have happened?
Why would she do a thing like that?

858
01:59:27,567 --> 01:59:31,480
To tell you the truth,
I'm not a friend of hers at all.

859
01:59:31,647 --> 01:59:34,320
I hardly know her, actually, but...

860
01:59:36,807 --> 01:59:38,604
Simone...

861
01:59:39,927 --> 01:59:41,599
Simone...

862
01:59:42,167 --> 01:59:44,840
You do recognise me, don't you?

863
01:59:45,367 --> 01:59:48,279
It's me. Stella.

864
01:59:49,087 --> 01:59:51,726
Your friend Stella.

865
01:59:51,887 --> 01:59:53,764
Don't you recognise me?

866
02:00:02,247 --> 02:00:04,238
