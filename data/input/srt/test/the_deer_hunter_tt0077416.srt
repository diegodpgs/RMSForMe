1
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:18,000

2
00:04:28,112 --> 00:04:30,114
How ya doin'?

3
00:04:30,114 --> 00:04:34,910
Hey, watch out, Axel. We'll be
calling him old fireballs after tonight.

4
00:04:34,952 --> 00:04:37,246
- Fuckin' A.
- Not bad.

5
00:04:39,248 --> 00:04:41,250
Hey, Stevie,
now that you're going to the army,

6
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,252
how about givin'
my 20 bucks back?

7
00:04:52,136 --> 00:04:54,430
- So long, Mike.
- Take care, Mike.

8
00:04:54,472 --> 00:04:56,390
I'll see ya, fellas.

9
00:04:56,432 --> 00:04:59,310
- Freddy!
- Hi, Mike. Be good.

10
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:02,521
- You hear about the happy Roman?
- Yeah.

11
00:05:02,521 --> 00:05:05,232
- He was "glad he ate her. "
- Come on. Let's go, let's go.

12
00:05:05,274 --> 00:05:07,443
- Where's Stan? Hey, Stan!
- I don't know.

13
00:05:07,485 --> 00:05:09,445
- I'll see you later.
- Take care.

14
00:05:09,487 --> 00:05:11,489
Nick! Write us.

15
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,532
- Take care of yourself, okay?
- Bye-bye.

16
00:05:13,574 --> 00:05:15,910
- So long.
- Take it easy, Mike.

17
00:05:15,951 --> 00:05:19,246
- Don't get your ass shot off, Okay? Good luck.
- Okay, I won't.

18
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:22,666
Hey! Say, Mike, take care of yourself.
Good luck to you.

19
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:26,045
- Kill a few for me too.
- I will. Stay out of trouble.

20
00:05:26,086 --> 00:05:28,047
Hey, little killer.

21
00:05:28,088 --> 00:05:30,549
Stevie! Hey!

22
00:05:32,635 --> 00:05:35,346
Hey, Axel, there's Stan.
Stanley!

23
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:38,057
- Stanley, you asshole.
- Hey, Stan!

24
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:41,519
Stan, it's no use!

25
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,854
Come on, Stosh.
You're beautiful now.

26
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:46,023
You're still
an ugly bastard, Stan!

27
00:05:46,065 --> 00:05:48,150
Good luck to you
in the army, man.

28
00:05:48,192 --> 00:05:50,110
Get Stanley, Axel.

29
00:05:50,152 --> 00:05:52,071
Come on. Come on.

30
00:05:53,155 --> 00:05:56,158
Get the hell outta here.

31
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,161
Come on, Stan. Let's go.

32
00:06:00,663 --> 00:06:04,542
Very mature. Very mature,
well-adapted individual, Stosh.

33
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,002
- Take it easy.
- Whoa.

34
00:06:07,044 --> 00:06:10,756
Hey! Look at that! Whoa!
What the hell is that?

35
00:06:10,798 --> 00:06:12,758
Where? Oh, yeah.

36
00:06:14,176 --> 00:06:17,972
Holy shit. You know what that is?
Those are sun dogs.

37
00:06:18,013 --> 00:06:19,014
What does it mean?

38
00:06:19,056 --> 00:06:22,893
A blessing on the hunter sent by
the great wolf to his children.

39
00:06:22,935 --> 00:06:26,772
- What the fuck are you talkin' about?
- It's an old Indian thing.

40
00:06:26,814 --> 00:06:29,316
You're full of shit.

41
00:06:29,358 --> 00:06:32,653
Stanley, would I shit you
about something like that?

42
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:34,613
You know, Mike,

43
00:06:34,655 --> 00:06:37,575
there's times when nobody but a doctor
can understand you.

44
00:06:37,616 --> 00:06:39,535
That's an omen,
you know that?

45
00:06:39,577 --> 00:06:42,913
We can have one great
fucking hunting trip tonight.

46
00:06:42,955 --> 00:06:46,250
Mike, I don't know
where you come up with all this.

47
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:48,544
Hey, wait a minute.

48
00:06:48,586 --> 00:06:51,881
What? Are you thinking of
going deer huntin' tonight?

49
00:06:51,922 --> 00:06:55,134
Not tonight.
I'm gettin' married tonight.

50
00:06:55,176 --> 00:06:57,553
- You fuckin' guys would go deer huntin'.
- Hey, hey.

51
00:06:57,595 --> 00:06:59,972
First we get you legal.
Tuck you into bed with Angela.

52
00:07:00,014 --> 00:07:01,932
Hey, baby.

53
00:07:01,974 --> 00:07:03,976
You guys are fuckin' nuts.
You know that?

54
00:07:04,018 --> 00:07:05,936
- Boy, you're all crazy.
- Life is over.

55
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:08,981
Yeah, right.
You're gettin' married. We're crazy.

56
00:07:09,023 --> 00:07:11,859
It's all right.
Hey, it's all right.

57
00:07:11,859 --> 00:07:15,488
We'll be right with you, all of us, won't we?
Right? Am I right?

58
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:17,948
- Right.
- Fuckin' A, man.

59
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,326
Come on. Come on, you guys.

60
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:23,162
- I'm buying the first round this morning.
- Hey, Steven!

61
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:26,582
Any help you might need tonight,
just feel free to call on me.

62
00:07:26,624 --> 00:07:30,085
Hey, Stanley, sometimes
your sense of humor ain't funny.

63
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:32,588
- Come on, Steven.
- Willing fingers.

64
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,590
Extra lips.

65
00:07:34,632 --> 00:07:36,550
Fuckin' A, man.

66
00:07:36,592 --> 00:07:39,804
- Hey, you're a regular poet, Axel.
- I couldn't agree with you more.

67
00:07:39,804 --> 00:07:41,806
- Get in the car.
- Come on. Come on.

68
00:07:47,102 --> 00:07:48,979
I do.

69
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:52,983
I do.

70
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:57,488
I do.

71
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,710
Oh, my God.

72
00:08:23,305 --> 00:08:26,308
I still do not
believe this.

73
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,270
My own boy
with a strange girl.

74
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:33,899
And not so thin, if you understand
my meaning. Not such a thin girl.

75
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:38,320
The next thing you know,
he goes to Vietnam.

76
00:08:40,906 --> 00:08:43,868
I do not understand, Father.

77
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:49,498
I understand
nothing anymore. Nothing!

78
00:08:52,293 --> 00:08:57,882
Why?

79
00:08:57,923 --> 00:09:02,720
Can you explain?
Can anyone explain?

80
00:09:29,997 --> 00:09:32,625
- Pass him on the inside.
- Oh-oh, you'd never do it.

81
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,293
Shut up.

82
00:09:34,335 --> 00:09:36,837
- It's your Caddy against my truck.
- Is today your lucky day?

83
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:38,839
You can't make it.

84
00:09:55,314 --> 00:09:58,317
Hey, hey, Axel,
you owe him a window.

85
00:09:58,359 --> 00:10:01,278
Mike! Mike!
Hey, mighty Mike!

86
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,364
- Oh, Axel.
- Here's your truck back.

87
00:10:03,405 --> 00:10:05,658
Oh, hell, I hope
he didn't break an axle.

88
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:07,910
I wouldn't want
to take advantage of you.

89
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,120
It's a million-to-one shot
against a sure thing.

90
00:10:10,162 --> 00:10:12,331
- There's no such thing as a sure thing.
- Yeah.

91
00:10:12,373 --> 00:10:14,291
Did you see that?

92
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:18,337
- Hey, Boom!
- Hey, how ya doin'?

93
00:10:19,046 --> 00:10:21,006
Don't take anybody's money!

94
00:10:21,048 --> 00:10:25,052
- Don't take my money. Take his money.
- Set 'em up.

95
00:10:26,428 --> 00:10:29,014
- Kessler and a Rolling Rock.
- Kessler and a Rolling Rock.

96
00:10:29,056 --> 00:10:31,809
Give him a short one.

97
00:10:31,851 --> 00:10:34,145
And give my friends down here
my warm regards.

98
00:10:34,186 --> 00:10:36,647
- John!
- Aaah!

99
00:10:41,026 --> 00:10:45,948
Hey, I got a hundred bucks says the Eagles
never cross the 50 in the next half.

100
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,409
And the Steelers win
by what? Twenty.

101
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:52,454
I got an extra 20 says
the Eagles' quarterback wears a dress!

102
00:10:54,832 --> 00:10:57,835
Take your money off the bar.
Drinks are on the house!

103
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:23,235
- Oh, did I get all wet?
- No. I don't know.

104
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,748
Come on, Amy!

105
00:11:39,835 --> 00:11:41,754
Come on!

106
00:11:44,048 --> 00:11:47,968
Uh, Joe, maybe we could use
some more flags.

107
00:11:51,555 --> 00:11:53,516
- Is that all right?
- Uh-

108
00:11:53,557 --> 00:11:56,060
- Up a bit, I would say, wouldn't you say so?
- Up!

109
00:11:56,101 --> 00:11:59,522
No, no, no, down.

110
00:11:59,563 --> 00:12:02,441
Oh, what a beautiful cake. Here.

111
00:12:06,153 --> 00:12:08,072
You've earned a drink.

112
00:12:11,158 --> 00:12:13,786
You have a beautiful cake.

113
00:12:13,786 --> 00:12:15,746
Hey!

114
00:12:15,746 --> 00:12:17,957
I haven't forgotten about you.

115
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:19,959
I have one for you too.

116
00:12:46,277 --> 00:12:49,655
Go to... fuckin' hell.

117
00:12:51,782 --> 00:12:55,786
I'll give every car
in the town a flat tire.

118
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,873
- Every goddamn one.
- Oh, Daddy.

119
00:12:58,914 --> 00:13:00,791
I'll do it!

120
00:13:02,668 --> 00:13:06,672
Yeah, I fuckin' mean
what I say, girl.

121
00:13:06,714 --> 00:13:08,632
Shh. Yes. Come on.

122
00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:12,470
- All around... like a sea.
- Oh, my God.

123
00:13:12,511 --> 00:13:15,264
Ocean of flat tires.

124
00:13:16,474 --> 00:13:18,476
- Fuckin'... bitch.
- No!

125
00:13:19,685 --> 00:13:21,604
All bitches.

126
00:13:24,106 --> 00:13:26,066
- I hate 'em.
- Daddy.

127
00:13:26,108 --> 00:13:29,695
- Daddy! Daddy, no, it's me!
- Fuckin' bitches!

128
00:13:29,737 --> 00:13:33,699
Give 'em all flat tires.

129
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,776
"You're just too good
to be true"

130
00:14:08,818 --> 00:14:13,405
That's great.
Now I'm gonna smoke your ass.

131
00:14:13,447 --> 00:14:16,575
"Like heaven to touch"

132
00:14:16,617 --> 00:14:19,662
"I wanna hold you so much"

133
00:14:19,703 --> 00:14:24,792
"At long last
love has arrived"

134
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:27,253
"And I thank God I'm alive"

135
00:14:27,294 --> 00:14:30,589
- "You're just too good to be true"
- It's my shot, right?

136
00:14:30,631 --> 00:14:33,008
- "Can't take my eyes"
- Come on, John.

137
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,427
- "Off of you"
- Wipe off the tables.

138
00:14:35,427 --> 00:14:39,390
This is it.
This is really it.

139
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:42,101
I mean,

140
00:14:42,143 --> 00:14:44,728
here I go.

141
00:14:51,402 --> 00:14:55,197
There's no sense
in gettin' too relaxed, buddy.

142
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:57,908
- "Let me know that it's real"
- Come on.

143
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,245
"You're just too good
to be true"

144
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:04,498
"Can't take my eyes
off of you"

145
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:09,712
"Ba-da, da-da
Da-da, ba-ba-ba"

146
00:15:09,753 --> 00:15:13,549
"Ba-da, ba-da
Ba-ba, da-da-da"

147
00:15:13,591 --> 00:15:17,303
"Ba-da, da-da
Da-da, ba-ba-ba"

148
00:15:17,344 --> 00:15:21,307
"Ba-da, ba-da, da"

149
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:24,477
"I love you, baby"

150
00:15:24,518 --> 00:15:26,395
"And if it's quite
all right"

151
00:15:26,437 --> 00:15:30,232
"I need you, baby
to warm the lonely night"

152
00:15:30,274 --> 00:15:32,693
"I love you, baby"

153
00:15:32,735 --> 00:15:36,739
"Trust in me when I say"

154
00:15:36,822 --> 00:15:39,783
"Oh, pretty baby"

155
00:15:39,825 --> 00:15:43,245
"Don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby"

156
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:45,206
"Now that I've found you
Stay"

157
00:15:45,247 --> 00:15:51,128
"And let me love you, baby
Let me love you"

158
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,923
- You faggot.
- "You're just too good"

159
00:15:53,964 --> 00:15:56,884
- "To be true"
- Bums!

160
00:15:56,926 --> 00:15:59,845
"Can't take my eyes
off of you"

161
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:01,889
"You-"

162
00:16:01,931 --> 00:16:03,891
Hey!

163
00:16:03,933 --> 00:16:07,520
- "I wanna hold you so much"
- Jesus.

164
00:16:14,443 --> 00:16:16,403
Jesus Christ!

165
00:16:16,445 --> 00:16:19,990
To do this to your own mother...

166
00:16:20,032 --> 00:16:23,494
who prays for you all her life.

167
00:16:23,536 --> 00:16:25,996
Is your heart so cruel,
so unfeeling?

168
00:16:26,038 --> 00:16:29,250
You marry this girl.
You leave her with me.

169
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:32,461
And you go with these bums
to the Vietnam!

170
00:16:32,461 --> 00:16:34,588
- Ow. Ow.
- Bullshit.

171
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,799
"And if it's quite all right"

172
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:40,052
One flight!
It's one flight upstairs!

173
00:16:40,094 --> 00:16:44,056
When I come home- One flight.

174
00:16:44,098 --> 00:16:45,933
I love Angela.

175
00:16:47,726 --> 00:16:49,645
And she loves me.

176
00:16:53,065 --> 00:16:55,734
Wear a scarf today!

177
00:16:55,734 --> 00:16:59,488
You don't wear a scarf
with a tuxedo.

178
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:03,242
I'm not gonna wear
a scarf with a tuxedo.

179
00:17:54,668 --> 00:17:57,671
- You tryin' to look like a prince?
- What do you mean "trying"?

180
00:17:59,381 --> 00:18:01,801
You should've done that
a long time ago.

181
00:18:01,842 --> 00:18:04,220
- That way, it would've set.
- I know.

182
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:07,556
- Then why didn't you do it?
- 'Cause I forgot.

183
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:14,438
Oh, man.

184
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,358
Steven's gettin' married
in a couple of hours.

185
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:20,694
We're talkin' about huntin'
the last time before the army.

186
00:18:20,694 --> 00:18:25,366
The whole thing, it's crazy.

187
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,952
I'll tell ya one thing.

188
00:18:27,993 --> 00:18:30,788
If I found out my life
had to end up in the mountains,

189
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,748
I'd be all right.

190
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,668
But it has to be
in your mind.

191
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:37,670
What?

192
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:40,673
One shot?

193
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:44,927
Two is pussy.

194
00:18:44,969 --> 00:18:47,263
I don't think about one shot
that much anymore, Mike.

195
00:18:47,263 --> 00:18:49,974
You have to think about one shot.
One shot is what it's all about.

196
00:18:50,015 --> 00:18:51,934
A deer has to be taken
with one shot.

197
00:18:51,976 --> 00:18:54,979
I try to tell people that.
They don't listen.

198
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,403
- You really think about Vietnam?
- Yeah.

199
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,740
I don't know. I guess.

200
00:19:06,782 --> 00:19:10,369
I'm thinkin' about the deer.
Going to Nam.

201
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:13,873
I like the trees, you know?

202
00:19:13,873 --> 00:19:17,877
I like the way the trees are in the mountains,
all the different-

203
00:19:21,172 --> 00:19:23,174
The way the trees are.

204
00:19:25,593 --> 00:19:27,887
I sound like
some asshole, right?

205
00:19:29,597 --> 00:19:33,142
I'll tell you, Nick, you're the only guy
I go huntin' with, you know?

206
00:19:33,184 --> 00:19:36,395
I like a guy with quick moves and speed.
I ain't gonna hunt with no assholes.

207
00:19:36,437 --> 00:19:38,689
- Well, who's an asshole?
- Who's an asshole?

208
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:41,317
Who do you think's
an asshole?

209
00:19:41,358 --> 00:19:43,861
They're all a bunch of assholes.

210
00:19:43,903 --> 00:19:47,907
I mean, I love 'em. They're great guys,
but without you, I'd hunt alone.

211
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:51,785
- Seriously, that's what I'd do.
- Well, you're a fuckin' nut.

212
00:19:51,827 --> 00:19:55,789
You know that, Mike.
You're a maniac, control freak.

213
00:19:55,915 --> 00:19:57,791
I just don't like
no surprises.

214
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,590
- Damn thing won't open.
- Well, give it a kick.

215
00:20:04,632 --> 00:20:06,801
Hey, man, hey, hey,
not like that. Not-

216
00:20:06,842 --> 00:20:09,470
Here, here, here.

217
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:11,722
- See that?
- Fuckin' A.

218
00:20:14,016 --> 00:20:16,685
Unreal.

219
00:20:16,727 --> 00:20:21,315
Axel, now I know why you're not
still kicking for the Steelers.

220
00:20:21,357 --> 00:20:24,026
You know, I love Mike's car.

221
00:20:24,068 --> 00:20:26,695
Yeah, some cars, they just sit.

222
00:20:26,695 --> 00:20:30,407
You never know with a car like this
where the hell it's gonna take you.

223
00:20:30,449 --> 00:20:33,994
Yeah.
It makes me feel safe.

224
00:20:37,915 --> 00:20:39,875
Oh, what is he doing?

225
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:43,921
Axel's humping
Mike's Coupe de Ville.

226
00:20:46,298 --> 00:20:50,219
- Axel, get out of there.
- Let's get the carnations.

227
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:53,472
Get up. Get up.
What are you doing?

228
00:20:53,514 --> 00:20:57,101
Come on. Sit up.
Oh, God, you're impossible.

229
00:20:57,101 --> 00:21:00,604
- Here, put this on, you have to have that on.
- Crummy tuxedo.

230
00:21:00,646 --> 00:21:03,607
Tuxedo's been stuck a million times.

231
00:21:03,607 --> 00:21:06,986
- Where'd you get this thing?
It's not funny.

232
00:21:07,027 --> 00:21:10,406
- I'm beautiful, right? I'm beautiful.
- No, you're not.

233
00:21:10,447 --> 00:21:12,324
- All set.
- Thanks, Amy.

234
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:23,294
You can't even
sit up, Axel. Oh!

235
00:21:23,335 --> 00:21:27,047
- Axel, come on. Sit up.
- Beautiful.

236
00:21:32,344 --> 00:21:35,514
Linda, what's the matter?
I was gonna pick you up.

237
00:21:35,556 --> 00:21:37,600
Hi.

238
00:21:37,641 --> 00:21:40,019
- What's the matter?
- He hit me.

239
00:21:42,146 --> 00:21:47,026
Hey, come here, come here.
I wanna ask you something.

240
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:48,986
Hey, wait a minute,
goddamn it.

241
00:21:49,028 --> 00:21:51,489
You don't walk away from me.
What is that on your face?

242
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,951
Nicky, you and Michael,
you're goin' away in a couple of days.

243
00:21:55,993 --> 00:21:59,246
I was just wonderin'
if I could use this place to stay.

244
00:21:59,288 --> 00:22:03,209
- Oh, sure.
- I'd wanna pay you both.

245
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,128
- And I was thinking-
- What are you talkin' about?

246
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:13,093
I would wanna
pay you, Nick.

247
00:22:13,135 --> 00:22:17,681
Hey, Kochatka,
it's me you're talking to.

248
00:22:17,723 --> 00:22:22,228
You know, how long
have you known me for?

249
00:22:22,269 --> 00:22:24,396
What?

250
00:22:24,438 --> 00:22:26,440
I don't know.

251
00:24:21,889 --> 00:24:24,517
Have you, Steven,
a free will and a firm intention...

252
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:27,186
to take unto yourself
as wife this woman, Angela,

253
00:24:27,228 --> 00:24:28,979
whom you see before you?

254
00:24:29,021 --> 00:24:30,147
I do.

255
00:24:30,189 --> 00:24:35,694
- You have not promised yourself to any other bride?
- I have not.

256
00:24:35,736 --> 00:24:38,405
Have you, Angela,
a free will and a firm intention...

257
00:24:38,447 --> 00:24:41,075
to take unto yourself
as husband this man, Steven,

258
00:24:41,116 --> 00:24:42,993
whom you see before you?

259
00:24:43,035 --> 00:24:44,370
I have.

260
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:48,791
- You have not promised yourself to any other man?
- I have not.

261
00:24:51,794 --> 00:24:55,089
Blessed is the kingdom
of the Father and of the Son...

262
00:24:55,131 --> 00:24:57,049
and of the Holy Spirit,

263
00:24:57,091 --> 00:25:02,096
now and ever
and unto ages of ages.

264
00:25:02,138 --> 00:25:07,977
"Amen"

265
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:54,458
"Entreat, entreat
the Lord"

266
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:59,255
"Entreat, entreat the Lord"

267
00:26:59,296 --> 00:27:04,009
"And He will have mercy"

268
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:10,724
"On our souls"

269
00:31:09,797 --> 00:31:12,800
Hey, hey, hey!

270
00:31:32,903 --> 00:31:34,864
Oh, hey,
what's going on?

271
00:31:34,905 --> 00:31:38,117
For a buck,
you get a shooter, a cigar...

272
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,328
and a dance
with the beautiful bride.

273
00:31:41,328 --> 00:31:43,205
Fuckin' A.

274
00:31:44,331 --> 00:31:46,208
And you're on your way.

275
00:31:56,302 --> 00:31:59,722
Do it. Come on. Do it.

276
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:30,127
Whoo!

277
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,617
May I have your attention,
please, ladies and gentlemen?

278
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:05,538
Quiet, please, please.

279
00:33:10,626 --> 00:33:14,046
That's really wonderful. Thank you.
May I have your attention, please?

280
00:33:14,088 --> 00:33:16,132
I have a very,
very important announcement.

281
00:33:16,173 --> 00:33:19,885
Whoever owns-

282
00:33:19,927 --> 00:33:23,848
Whoever owns a white Chevy Impala,
would you please move it?

283
00:33:23,889 --> 00:33:26,725
It's blocking the driveway.

284
00:33:29,562 --> 00:33:32,439
Whoever owns
a white Chevy Impala,

285
00:33:34,525 --> 00:33:36,443
it's blocking the driveway.

286
00:33:37,528 --> 00:33:39,446
A white Chevy Impala.

287
00:33:45,828 --> 00:33:48,497
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen,

288
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:51,125
Angela and Steven
would like to welcome you...

289
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:53,752
and to introduce you
to their bridal party,

290
00:33:53,794 --> 00:33:56,213
and especially
to Michael and Nick,

291
00:33:56,255 --> 00:33:59,133
who are also going to Vietnam
with Steven...

292
00:33:59,175 --> 00:34:02,761
to proudly serve their country.

293
00:34:52,686 --> 00:34:56,273
"You're just too good to be true"

294
00:34:56,315 --> 00:34:59,860
"Can't take my eyes
off of you"

295
00:34:59,902 --> 00:35:01,862
Will you dance with me?

296
00:35:04,573 --> 00:35:08,786
Monday, Monday's the day.
Yeah, Monday, Monday.

297
00:35:08,828 --> 00:35:12,957
You're so sweet.
Thanks for being my maid of honor.

298
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:20,172
Dance, dance.

299
00:35:20,214 --> 00:35:22,133
You want me to-

300
00:35:22,174 --> 00:35:26,178
You nut, you want me to dance?
You want me to dance? Hey, Nicky!

301
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:32,393
Michael, Michael!

302
00:35:35,563 --> 00:35:37,565
Oh, my God.

303
00:35:37,565 --> 00:35:39,567
- Hey, how ya been?
- Excuse me.

304
00:35:40,693 --> 00:35:42,653
Hey, Nick, Nick,
you know, you know,

305
00:35:42,695 --> 00:35:44,697
you know that I'd be going
with you guys...

306
00:35:44,738 --> 00:35:47,283
if, if, if it wasn't
for my knees.

307
00:35:47,324 --> 00:35:49,785
You know that?

308
00:35:49,827 --> 00:35:51,787
Wait.

309
00:36:00,004 --> 00:36:04,008
"I love you, baby
And if it's quite all right"

310
00:36:04,008 --> 00:36:07,970
"I need you, baby
to warm the lonely nights"

311
00:36:08,012 --> 00:36:11,265
"Oh, I love you, baby"

312
00:36:11,307 --> 00:36:14,477
"Trust in me when I say"

313
00:36:14,602 --> 00:36:17,354
"Oh, pretty baby"

314
00:36:17,396 --> 00:36:21,275
"Don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby"

315
00:36:21,317 --> 00:36:23,819
"Now that I've found you
Stay"

316
00:36:23,861 --> 00:36:26,280
"And let me love you, baby"

317
00:36:26,322 --> 00:36:30,159
"Let me love you"

318
00:36:30,201 --> 00:36:33,954
"You're just too good
to be true"

319
00:36:33,996 --> 00:36:37,583
"Can't take my eyes
off of you"

320
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:41,420
"You feel like heaven
to touch"

321
00:36:41,462 --> 00:36:45,216
"I want to hold you so much"

322
00:36:45,382 --> 00:36:48,886
"At long last
love has arrived"

323
00:36:48,886 --> 00:36:52,306
I'm not the greatest dancer
in the world.

324
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,392
- You're okay.
- I am not.

325
00:36:55,434 --> 00:36:59,021
No, you're very fancy.

326
00:37:00,689 --> 00:37:03,651
You want a beer
or something like that?

327
00:37:03,692 --> 00:37:07,071
- You want a beer or something?
- Okay. Sure.

328
00:37:07,112 --> 00:37:10,324
- What kind of beer would you like?
- What? I don't know.

329
00:37:10,324 --> 00:37:13,494
- What kind of beer would you like?
- I don't care. Any kind.

330
00:37:13,536 --> 00:37:15,955
- I'll get you a Rolling Rock.
- Okay.

331
00:37:15,996 --> 00:37:19,416
- That's a good beer, it's the best around.
- Huh? Yeah, okay.

332
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:21,794
- Rolling Rock?
- Yeah.

333
00:37:21,836 --> 00:37:23,796
Be right back.

334
00:37:23,796 --> 00:37:27,424
"Oh, pretty baby
Don't bring me down, I pray"

335
00:37:27,466 --> 00:37:31,220
"I need you, baby
to warm the lonely night"

336
00:37:31,262 --> 00:37:35,015
"I love you, baby
Trust in me when I say"

337
00:37:37,226 --> 00:37:39,186
You wanna come?
I'll get you-

338
00:37:39,228 --> 00:37:42,398
"Oh, pretty baby
Don't bring me down, I pray"

339
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:45,609
"Oh, pretty baby
Now that I've found you, stay"

340
00:37:45,651 --> 00:37:49,405
"And let me love you, baby"

341
00:37:49,446 --> 00:37:51,407
"Let me love you"

342
00:37:51,448 --> 00:37:53,367
Hey, Jerry.

343
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:56,078
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

344
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,081
Jerry, give us two
Rolling Rocks...

345
00:37:59,123 --> 00:38:01,834
and give me a Kessler
on the side.

346
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:04,503
It's okay.
It's a wedding, you know.

347
00:38:04,503 --> 00:38:08,507
You're supposed to let go
and have fun and all that.

348
00:38:10,009 --> 00:38:12,011
You really like Nick a lot, huh?

349
00:38:12,052 --> 00:38:14,013
Anybody else for a shooter?

350
00:38:15,014 --> 00:38:17,016
Yeah.

351
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:51,217
Axel!

352
00:38:51,258 --> 00:38:54,136
Put me down!
What are you doing?

353
00:38:54,178 --> 00:38:56,555
Axel! Help!

354
00:39:08,234 --> 00:39:12,196
Axel, no!
Axel, put me down!

355
00:39:12,238 --> 00:39:14,448
- What are you doing? Oh, Axel.
- I'm gonna kiss you.

356
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:17,868
Stop! Stop!
I'm gonna stab you.

357
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:21,247
- You wanna fuck or fight?
- Axel!

358
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,464
I think I might like to dance
with the lady, if you don't mind.

359
00:39:37,471 --> 00:39:39,974
Have you known him long?

360
00:39:52,069 --> 00:39:54,947
This is the most fun
I've had in months.

361
00:40:05,749 --> 00:40:09,462
Do you know what that son of a bitch
is doing?

362
00:40:12,756 --> 00:40:15,259
He's got his hand
on her ass!

363
00:40:15,301 --> 00:40:19,263
It's only-
It's only-

364
00:40:19,472 --> 00:40:23,184
- It's only a wedding.
- What do you mean, "It's only a wedding"?

365
00:40:23,184 --> 00:40:26,645
The guy- Look, he did it again!
He just did it!

366
00:40:26,645 --> 00:40:31,066
- Come on. I gotta go get my gun out of my coat.
- Go get your gun. Go get it.

367
00:40:55,674 --> 00:40:58,177
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

368
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:00,679
Time out. Time out!

369
00:41:18,989 --> 00:41:21,033
You hurt me, you-

370
00:41:21,075 --> 00:41:23,494
You punched me right there.
It hurts.

371
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,667
Is that better?

372
00:41:49,812 --> 00:41:51,772
I'm gonna kick
on his fuckin' ass.

373
00:41:53,482 --> 00:41:55,985
- Hey, Stan is crazy.
- Why? What happened?

374
00:41:56,026 --> 00:41:57,987
- That Stan is crazy.
- What happened?

375
00:41:58,028 --> 00:41:59,947
It's a Green Beret!

376
00:41:59,989 --> 00:42:03,951
- Hey! Whoo!
- No kidding.

377
00:42:03,993 --> 00:42:06,579
Jerry!
Jerry, give the man a drink.

378
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:10,416
- Hey!
- Give him a drink!

379
00:42:10,416 --> 00:42:13,002
- Sir! Sir!
- Sir!

380
00:42:13,043 --> 00:42:14,545
Na zdorovije.

381
00:42:14,587 --> 00:42:16,797
- Na zdorovije.
- Na zdorovije.

382
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,680
Don't cause any kind
of problem, huh?

383
00:42:24,722 --> 00:42:28,517
Nah, I wanna talk to the man. I wanna talk to the man.
We're goin' over there.

384
00:42:28,517 --> 00:42:30,603
Sir, Mike Vronsky.

385
00:42:33,689 --> 00:42:38,611
- Nick. This is the groom, Steve.
- I'm the best man.

386
00:42:40,488 --> 00:42:42,490
We're goin' airborne, sir.
What's it like?

387
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:44,492
- I hope they send us where the bullets are flyin'.
- That's right.

388
00:42:44,533 --> 00:42:47,995
- Fighting's the worst, huh?
- That's right.

389
00:42:48,037 --> 00:42:49,914
Fuck it.

390
00:42:50,998 --> 00:42:53,501
- Fuck it? What did he say?
- Fuck it.

391
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:56,462
Fuck it.
That's what I thought.

392
00:42:56,504 --> 00:42:59,924
W- Well, what's it like
over there?

393
00:42:59,965 --> 00:43:03,302
Can you tell us anything?

394
00:43:03,344 --> 00:43:05,221
Fuck it.

395
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:09,433
Okay, fuck it.

396
00:43:09,433 --> 00:43:11,435
Fuck him.

397
00:43:16,398 --> 00:43:18,734
Fuck it. Hey!

398
00:43:18,734 --> 00:43:20,986
Michael, hey.

399
00:43:21,028 --> 00:43:23,405
- Hey.
- Fuck who?

400
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:27,201
Fuck who?

401
00:43:28,702 --> 00:43:30,830
- Who the hell is he?
- Who the fuck knows?

402
00:43:30,871 --> 00:43:32,998
He looks like a fuckin' hillbilly.

403
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,001
Give him another drink, Jerry.
Just the same.

404
00:43:36,043 --> 00:43:38,546
Hey! Fuck it!

405
00:43:38,587 --> 00:43:41,006
Fuck you.

406
00:43:43,217 --> 00:43:45,719
Hey! Hey!

407
00:43:57,523 --> 00:44:00,109
Hey! Hey!

408
00:44:10,244 --> 00:44:12,455
Steven.

409
00:44:12,455 --> 00:44:14,623
Hey! Hey!

410
00:44:19,128 --> 00:44:21,547
Hey! Hey!

411
00:44:30,556 --> 00:44:32,433
Oh!

412
00:44:40,232 --> 00:44:43,527
Hey! Hey!

413
00:44:52,661 --> 00:44:54,747
Hey! Hey!

414
00:45:10,471 --> 00:45:13,933
I got it!

415
00:45:20,356 --> 00:45:22,274
Will you marry me?

416
00:45:24,151 --> 00:45:26,153
Yeah.

417
00:45:27,154 --> 00:45:29,156
You would?

418
00:45:29,198 --> 00:45:31,117
Mm-hmm.

419
00:45:31,158 --> 00:45:35,162
What I mean is
if we get back from-

420
00:45:35,204 --> 00:45:37,623
I mean, when we get back.

421
00:45:37,665 --> 00:45:39,625
I don't know
what the hell I mean.

422
00:45:39,667 --> 00:45:43,379
I think what goes through your mind
comes out your mouth.

423
00:45:43,379 --> 00:45:45,381
Angela and Steven,

424
00:45:48,551 --> 00:45:50,511
if you don't spill a drop,

425
00:45:50,553 --> 00:45:53,556
it's good luck
for the rest of your life.

426
00:48:10,401 --> 00:48:13,904
- Hey!
- Hey, hey!

427
00:48:13,946 --> 00:48:17,366
Whoo!

428
00:48:17,408 --> 00:48:19,994
Don't worry what Stan says.
Just forget that.

429
00:48:20,035 --> 00:48:22,705
- He's got a big fucking mouth.
- Right.

430
00:48:22,746 --> 00:48:24,707
- Huh?
- That's enough.

431
00:48:24,748 --> 00:48:26,667
- Hey!
- Come here.

432
00:48:26,709 --> 00:48:29,628
I never really did it
with Angela, Nicky.

433
00:48:33,507 --> 00:48:35,426
Great. That's great.

434
00:48:37,303 --> 00:48:39,763
That's my last one true secret.

435
00:48:39,805 --> 00:48:42,600
It's nothing. It's nothing.
Just forget about it.

436
00:48:42,641 --> 00:48:45,519
Angela, Angela!

437
00:48:48,397 --> 00:48:50,399
Oh, Angela.

438
00:48:50,399 --> 00:48:52,401
What am I gonna do
when she has the baby?

439
00:48:52,401 --> 00:48:54,403
- That's Angela's part, right?
- That's right.

440
00:48:54,445 --> 00:48:56,405
- Just hang loose.
- Hang loose?

441
00:48:56,447 --> 00:48:58,491
Be happy.

442
00:48:58,532 --> 00:49:01,410
Go on. Get out of here.
We don't wanna see you anymore.

443
00:49:01,452 --> 00:49:03,329
Look at this maniac.

444
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:07,708
I'll see you Monday
on the train.

445
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:11,295
- Hey.
- Drive carefully.

446
00:49:11,337 --> 00:49:15,716
- You didn't know that about Angela, huh? Right?
- Oh, that's bullshit.

447
00:49:15,758 --> 00:49:18,135
- Oh, it's bullshit, right? Yeah?
- It's bullshit. Bullshit.

448
00:49:18,177 --> 00:49:20,095
- I happen to know it's true.
- That's bullshit.

449
00:49:20,137 --> 00:49:22,097
- I happen to know it's true. All right?
- You're full of bullshit.

450
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:25,309
- Do you wanna bet? Put your money where your mouth is.
- Yeah. Bullshit.

451
00:49:25,351 --> 00:49:27,436
- Go fuck yourself, Stan.
- Huh? Go fuck yourself.

452
00:49:27,478 --> 00:49:31,440
- Fuck you.
- Ah, grow up.

453
00:49:31,482 --> 00:49:35,319
Hey! Hey! All right!

454
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:51,043
Michael, Michael, what are you doing?

455
00:49:51,085 --> 00:49:55,047
- Mike! Hey, Mike!
- Michael!

456
00:49:55,256 --> 00:49:59,218
Michael, what the hell are you doing?

457
00:49:59,552 --> 00:50:02,721
- Michael!
- Hey!

458
00:50:02,721 --> 00:50:06,058
Michael, what the hell
are you doing? Michael!

459
00:50:06,058 --> 00:50:09,520
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Fuck it!

460
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:14,358
Michael, come back here!
What the hell is he doing?

461
00:50:14,358 --> 00:50:16,443
Michael, what the hell are you doing?

462
00:50:16,485 --> 00:50:18,529
- Hey, Mike!
- Michael, come back here!

463
00:50:18,571 --> 00:50:20,489
Come here, Michael!

464
00:50:20,531 --> 00:50:23,033
You know we love you!
Get back here!

465
00:50:23,075 --> 00:50:27,830
Hey, Mike!
I gotta talk to you!

466
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:38,841
Mike!

467
00:50:45,848 --> 00:50:47,766
Hey!

468
00:51:12,541 --> 00:51:14,543
Shit!

469
00:51:16,962 --> 00:51:19,548
I must be out of
my fuckin' mind.

470
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:22,551
I must be out of my mind.

471
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:29,767
I don't know.
Everything's going so fast.

472
00:51:29,809 --> 00:51:32,269
Man, oh, man.

473
00:51:32,311 --> 00:51:34,772
Hey, Nick.

474
00:51:36,774 --> 00:51:39,151
Think we'll ever come back?

475
00:51:39,193 --> 00:51:41,153
- From Nam?
- Yeah.

476
00:51:44,657 --> 00:51:46,951
You know something?

477
00:51:46,951 --> 00:51:52,289
The whole thing,
it's right here.

478
00:51:52,289 --> 00:51:54,250
I love this fuckin' place.

479
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:56,335
- You're crazy, man.
- I know that sounds crazy.

480
00:51:56,377 --> 00:52:00,381
If anything happens, Mike,
don't leave me over there.

481
00:52:00,589 --> 00:52:03,968
You got- You gotta-
Just don't leave me.

482
00:52:04,009 --> 00:52:07,388
- You gotta promise me that, Mike.
- Hey.

483
00:52:07,429 --> 00:52:10,349
No, man, you got-
you gotta-

484
00:52:10,391 --> 00:52:13,269
You gotta promise definitely.

485
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:15,437
- Hey, Nicky.
- Huh?

486
00:52:15,479 --> 00:52:19,191
- You got it, pal.
- Promise?

487
00:53:00,983 --> 00:53:03,944
"Shout Geronimo, Geronimo"

488
00:53:03,986 --> 00:53:07,198
"It's a silk and check your canopy
and take a look around"

489
00:53:07,239 --> 00:53:10,451
"The air is filled with troopers
set for battle on the ground"

490
00:53:10,493 --> 00:53:13,662
"'Til we join the stick of angels
Kill the lengthy Amazon"

491
00:53:13,704 --> 00:53:17,291
- "Shout Geronimo, Geronimo"
- It's the Screaming Eagles Airborne song.

492
00:53:17,333 --> 00:53:20,377
"It's a gory road to glory, But we're ready
Here we go"

493
00:53:20,419 --> 00:53:22,963
- "Shout Geronimo"
- Screaming assholes.

494
00:53:23,005 --> 00:53:25,966
- "Geronimo, look out below"
- Fuckin' A.

495
00:53:25,966 --> 00:53:28,844
- "Look out below"
- "Let me be free"

496
00:53:28,886 --> 00:53:32,389
- "Let me be free"
- I don't remember the rest of the words.

497
00:53:32,431 --> 00:53:34,350
"So let me be free"

498
00:53:34,391 --> 00:53:39,104
- "You'll always be happy with me"
- Chickenshit, get scared.

499
00:53:54,203 --> 00:53:56,163
Oh, boy.

500
00:53:56,205 --> 00:53:58,124
Fuckin' cold.

501
00:54:00,626 --> 00:54:03,087
Thirty-six beers.

502
00:54:03,129 --> 00:54:06,382
- Whoo! What?
- Come on.

503
00:54:06,423 --> 00:54:08,592
All right,
I'll go on, already.

504
00:54:08,634 --> 00:54:10,511
Wait, wait.

505
00:54:14,723 --> 00:54:19,728
You ever piss and take a drink of beer
at the same time?

506
00:54:23,315 --> 00:54:25,317
Whoa.

507
00:54:27,736 --> 00:54:30,531
Ah, I just barely
got a chance to shake it off.

508
00:54:30,531 --> 00:54:32,408
Wait! Come on!
Oh, fuck!

509
00:54:36,036 --> 00:54:37,913
Bastards!

510
00:54:39,415 --> 00:54:41,333
Sons of bitches!

511
00:55:17,036 --> 00:55:19,914
- You guys goin' my way?
- Come on.

512
00:55:26,045 --> 00:55:27,922
Fuck!

513
00:55:31,217 --> 00:55:35,221
That's not funny!

514
00:55:52,738 --> 00:55:54,740
No fuckin' around now.

515
00:55:56,742 --> 00:55:59,745
Come on. Stick around.
Don't fuck around.

516
00:56:01,247 --> 00:56:03,249
All right?
No fuckin' around.

517
00:56:31,569 --> 00:56:34,572
- Lemme out! Lemme out!
- Out, out. Get out.

518
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,120
This is not it.
Definitely.

519
00:56:41,162 --> 00:56:43,164
- They changed it.
- No kidding.

520
00:56:43,205 --> 00:56:45,124
Somehow they changed it.

521
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:49,753
- Like this happens every goddamn year.
- You're full of shit, Stanley.

522
00:56:49,795 --> 00:56:52,548
- Who did you say was full of shit?
- You're full of shit.

523
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:56,260
- You're always full of shit.
- I'm starvin'.

524
00:56:56,302 --> 00:56:59,138
Eat that.

525
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:01,515
Nick, how come
I never see you eatin'?

526
00:57:01,557 --> 00:57:04,226
I like to starve myself.
Keeps the fear up.

527
00:57:04,268 --> 00:57:07,646
- It ain't natural. Come on, John.
- Hey! That's mine.

528
00:57:07,688 --> 00:57:11,025
- You really want it that bad?
- You're goddamn right.

529
00:57:11,066 --> 00:57:15,571
- Hey, give me a Twinkie, Mike.
- What are you guys, a bunch of cripples?

530
00:57:22,953 --> 00:57:26,415
- That's mustard!
- What?

531
00:57:26,457 --> 00:57:29,835
He put mustard
on his Twink-

532
00:57:29,877 --> 00:57:32,713
You're talkin' like
a goddamn traffic cop.

533
00:57:32,755 --> 00:57:35,800
- Oh, fuck-
- Come on. Give me a beer, Mike.

534
00:57:35,841 --> 00:57:38,844
- Come on. Come on.
- I can't believe you guys.

535
00:57:38,886 --> 00:57:41,472
- What the hell am I doing with you?
- This is not it.

536
00:57:41,514 --> 00:57:44,225
They changed it.
Somehow they changed it.

537
00:57:44,266 --> 00:57:48,270
- You couldn't find your own ass with two hands.
- Fuckin' A.

538
00:57:48,479 --> 00:57:53,192
Hey, you know, we forgot
to toast Steven and Angela.

539
00:57:53,192 --> 00:57:55,361
Steven and Angela!

540
00:57:55,402 --> 00:57:59,865
Na zdorovije!

541
00:58:01,992 --> 00:58:05,996
What?

542
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,542
Don't make me laugh
when I have things in my mouth.

543
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:12,169
I can't take you guys anyplace.
What the hell you doin'?

544
00:58:12,211 --> 00:58:14,547
Get your hands
off the fuckin' bread.

545
00:58:14,588 --> 00:58:17,091
You can dress 'em up,
but you can't take 'em anywhere.

546
00:58:17,133 --> 00:58:19,051
Oh, come on.
Come on!

547
00:58:19,093 --> 00:58:21,887
What the fuck you doin'?
That was mine, you assholes.

548
00:58:27,101 --> 00:58:29,979
Fuckin' assholes.
I can't fuckin'-

549
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:33,440
- Fuckin' A!
- What the fuck?

550
00:58:33,482 --> 00:58:36,402
You know, Axel, you got
a terrific vocabulary.

551
00:58:36,444 --> 00:58:39,196
- Fuckin' A.
- Hey, watch the gear.

552
00:58:39,238 --> 00:58:41,991
Watch the rifle.
Axel, gimme my bag.

553
00:58:44,702 --> 00:58:46,579
It's gettin' cold, huh?

554
00:58:47,997 --> 00:58:51,000
Hey, Mike, you got
any extra thermal socks?

555
00:58:57,590 --> 00:59:00,885
Hey, Mike, you got
any extra thermal socks?

556
00:59:02,094 --> 00:59:04,013
Never mind. I got 'em.

557
00:59:05,389 --> 00:59:07,391
Where the hell's my boots?

558
00:59:10,394 --> 00:59:12,855
Anybody see my boots?

559
00:59:12,897 --> 00:59:16,317
Somebody took my boots.
I bought 'em special.

560
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:22,114
All right. All right, you guys.
Whoever took my boots, I want 'em back.

561
00:59:22,156 --> 00:59:25,785
I got a boot for you, Stan,
right up your ass.

562
00:59:25,826 --> 00:59:27,703
Hey, Mike.

563
00:59:29,997 --> 00:59:33,000
Hey, Mike, lemme borrow
your spares, huh?

564
00:59:33,042 --> 00:59:36,003
- Your extra pair?
- No, Stan.

565
00:59:36,045 --> 00:59:38,005
No?

566
00:59:39,924 --> 00:59:43,594
- What do you mean, "No"?
- Just what I said. No. No means no.

567
00:59:45,721 --> 00:59:48,891
Some fuckin' friend.
You're some fuckin' friend, you know that?

568
00:59:48,933 --> 00:59:52,019
Every time you come here,
you got your head up your ass.

569
00:59:52,061 --> 00:59:55,523
Maybe he likes the view from up there.

570
00:59:59,527 --> 01:00:02,696
Every time he comes up,
he's got no knife, no jacket.

571
01:00:02,738 --> 01:00:05,074
He's got no pants, no boots.

572
01:00:05,116 --> 01:00:08,619
All he's got is that stupid gun
he carries like John Wayne.

573
01:00:08,661 --> 01:00:10,579
That ain't gonna help ya.

574
01:00:10,621 --> 01:00:13,374
Oh, what the hell, Mike.
Give him the boots.

575
01:00:13,415 --> 01:00:17,419
No, I ain't givin' him no boots.
No more. That's it.

576
01:00:17,461 --> 01:00:21,423
You're a fuckin' bastard,
you know that? Huh?

577
01:00:21,507 --> 01:00:23,467
Stanley, see this?
This is this.

578
01:00:23,509 --> 01:00:26,720
This ain't somethin' else.
This is this.

579
01:00:26,762 --> 01:00:29,640
From now on, you're on your own.

580
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:35,813
I fixed you up a million times.

581
01:00:35,855 --> 01:00:38,274
I fixed him up a million times.

582
01:00:38,315 --> 01:00:40,734
I don't know how many times
I must've fixed him up with girls.

583
01:00:40,776 --> 01:00:43,404
And nothin' ever happened. Zero.

584
01:00:43,446 --> 01:00:47,074
You know your trouble, Mike?
Nobody ever knows what you're talkin' about.

585
01:00:47,116 --> 01:00:50,744
"This is this. " What the hell's
that supposed to mean? "This is this. "

586
01:00:50,744 --> 01:00:53,747
Is that faggot-soundin' bullshit,
or is that faggot-soundin'-

587
01:00:53,747 --> 01:00:57,001
Shut up, Stan, will ya?
Hey, man, you're outta line.

588
01:00:57,042 --> 01:01:00,212
Watch out with that gun, Stan.
Watch out with the gun.

589
01:01:00,212 --> 01:01:04,133
Do you know what I think? There's
times I swear I think you're a faggot.

590
01:01:04,175 --> 01:01:06,093
Hey, come on, you guys.

591
01:01:06,135 --> 01:01:09,346
Last week he could've had that new
redheaded waitress at the Bowladrome.

592
01:01:09,388 --> 01:01:11,640
He could've had it,
but look what he did.

593
01:01:11,682 --> 01:01:14,101
Nothin', that's what.

594
01:01:14,143 --> 01:01:17,313
Shut up, Stan.
Just shut up!

595
01:01:17,354 --> 01:01:21,817
Just shut up. Take- Take Michael's
goddamn boots and shut up.

596
01:01:21,859 --> 01:01:24,820
Otherwise, I'm goin' home.
I'm goin' home right now.

597
01:01:24,862 --> 01:01:29,158
Get off my stuff.
What the hell're you doin'?

598
01:01:31,243 --> 01:01:33,412
Hey, Stosh.

599
01:01:33,412 --> 01:01:35,539
I said, "No. "

600
01:01:40,461 --> 01:01:43,255
What? Are you gonna
shoot me? Huh?

601
01:01:44,256 --> 01:01:46,425
Here.

602
01:02:05,569 --> 01:02:07,571
What's the matter with you?

603
01:02:07,571 --> 01:02:10,241
Stan.

604
01:05:23,809 --> 01:05:26,812
Watch it, Mike! Pow! Whack!

605
01:05:32,318 --> 01:05:35,905
Hey! Hey, Angela!

606
01:05:38,824 --> 01:05:42,703
Bums! Go home!
Go home!

607
01:05:55,716 --> 01:05:57,676
"Drop-kick me, Jesus"

608
01:05:57,718 --> 01:06:00,095
"Through the goalposts of life"

609
01:06:00,137 --> 01:06:03,974
"End over end
Neither left nor to right"

610
01:06:04,016 --> 01:06:08,020
"Straight through the heart
of the righteous uprights"

611
01:06:08,229 --> 01:06:18,114
"Drop-kick me, Jesus,
through the goalposts of life"

612
01:06:18,155 --> 01:06:22,118

614
01:06:26,747 --> 01:06:28,874
"Drop-kick me, Jesus"

615
01:06:28,916 --> 01:06:31,836
"Through the goalposts of life"

616
01:06:31,877 --> 01:06:33,796

617
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:35,881

620
01:06:46,684 --> 01:06:48,686
"Drop-kick me, Jesus"

621
01:06:48,727 --> 01:06:52,648
"Through the goalposts of life"

622
01:10:38,207 --> 01:10:41,585
Un-fuckin'- believable.

623
01:11:29,008 --> 01:11:31,302
Oh, Christ.
I don't believe it.

624
01:11:32,428 --> 01:11:34,763
- Mike?
- Mike!

625
01:11:34,805 --> 01:11:37,099
Jesus Christ!
Hey!

626
01:11:37,141 --> 01:11:39,518
Incoming!

627
01:13:32,256 --> 01:13:35,342
Steven, take it easy.
Stevie!

628
01:13:35,384 --> 01:13:38,262
Stevie, calm down!

629
01:13:46,645 --> 01:13:48,606
Think of something else.

630
01:13:48,647 --> 01:13:50,649
Tell yourself to think
of something else.

631
01:13:56,071 --> 01:13:58,949
We don't belong here.

632
01:14:16,258 --> 01:14:18,719
Stevie, take it easy.

633
01:14:18,761 --> 01:14:22,264
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

634
01:14:22,306 --> 01:14:25,768
I'm all right.
- It's gonna be okay.

635
01:14:43,077 --> 01:14:45,037
I'm okay.

636
01:14:45,079 --> 01:14:49,041
Okay, just take it easy.

637
01:14:49,041 --> 01:14:52,962
It's okay. It's okay.

638
01:14:52,962 --> 01:14:54,880
Take it easy.
Stevie, take it easy.

639
01:14:58,759 --> 01:15:00,761
Mike?

640
01:15:07,685 --> 01:15:11,480
Come on. Come on. Come on.

641
01:15:11,522 --> 01:15:14,567
I'm okay.

642
01:15:41,093 --> 01:15:45,473
Easy. Okay. Okay.

643
01:15:45,514 --> 01:15:48,100
All right, press hard.
Press hard. Press hard.

644
01:15:48,142 --> 01:15:50,895
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

645
01:15:50,936 --> 01:15:53,689
Go ahead. That's it.
That's it.

646
01:15:53,731 --> 01:15:56,192
Mike.

647
01:15:58,402 --> 01:16:01,071
Shake it off.

648
01:16:01,113 --> 01:16:03,365
Shake it off. Shake it out.

649
01:16:03,365 --> 01:16:05,576
Think of something else.

650
01:16:05,618 --> 01:16:09,205
Think of home.
Think of home.

651
01:16:52,998 --> 01:16:56,502
- Come on.
- They're gonna have to kill my ass, Mike.

652
01:16:58,629 --> 01:17:00,589
Stevie, you gotta do it.

653
01:17:00,631 --> 01:17:03,300
You don't do it,
they're gonna throw you in the pit.

654
01:17:03,342 --> 01:17:05,970
They throw you in the pit,
you're gonna die.

655
01:17:06,011 --> 01:17:08,681
Go ahead. You gotta do it.
You can do it.

656
01:17:08,722 --> 01:17:11,308
You can do it, Stevie.
You can do it.

657
01:17:16,939 --> 01:17:18,899
Look in my eyes.

658
01:17:18,941 --> 01:17:20,943
Stevie?
Stevie, look at me!

659
01:17:20,943 --> 01:17:23,571
- Mike?
- Do it!

660
01:17:23,612 --> 01:17:27,032
Go ahead.
Show 'em you got balls.

661
01:17:27,074 --> 01:17:28,993
Aw, fuck you.

662
01:17:29,034 --> 01:17:33,038
Go ahead. Shoot me! Go ahead!

663
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,543
Come on.

664
01:17:41,839 --> 01:17:43,799
Go ahead.
Go ahead, Stevie!

665
01:17:43,841 --> 01:17:46,510
Go ahead! Show 'em you got balls!

666
01:17:46,552 --> 01:17:48,721
Go ahead!

667
01:18:02,026 --> 01:18:04,487
Hey, kid. Kid.

668
01:18:04,528 --> 01:18:07,740
Look at me, Stevie. You did it.

669
01:18:11,327 --> 01:18:13,287
Stevie.

670
01:18:13,329 --> 01:18:16,332
You showed these bastards.
Showed 'em.

671
01:18:28,636 --> 01:18:31,931
Don't worry, kid.

672
01:18:31,972 --> 01:18:33,849
You did it.

673
01:18:50,449 --> 01:18:55,162
- Michael! Michael!
- Stevie!

674
01:19:02,336 --> 01:19:07,758
Michael!

675
01:19:13,139 --> 01:19:15,766
Stevie!
Stevie, don't worry!

676
01:19:15,808 --> 01:19:18,227
Mike!

677
01:19:18,269 --> 01:19:20,396
Mike! Oh!

678
01:19:20,438 --> 01:19:22,523
Oh, God.

679
01:19:22,565 --> 01:19:25,359
Michael, there's rats in here.

680
01:19:45,379 --> 01:19:47,465
Nicky-

681
01:19:54,346 --> 01:19:59,351
Motherfucker!

682
01:20:00,478 --> 01:20:02,688
Nicky, listen.

683
01:20:06,776 --> 01:20:09,487
It's up to us now.
It's me and you.

684
01:20:09,487 --> 01:20:11,989
What about Steven?

685
01:20:11,989 --> 01:20:14,533
Forget him.

686
01:20:14,575 --> 01:20:17,870
- Forget him?
- He ain't gonna make it.

687
01:20:17,912 --> 01:20:20,456
Who do you think
you are? God?

688
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:24,627
Look at him.
He's in a daze.

689
01:20:24,668 --> 01:20:27,171
He ain't comin' out.
He's in a dream.

690
01:20:27,213 --> 01:20:29,215
Mike, what are you saying?

691
01:20:29,215 --> 01:20:31,217
I'm saying forget him.

692
01:20:31,258 --> 01:20:33,135
Get it through your head,

693
01:20:33,177 --> 01:20:35,596
or you and me are both gone too.

694
01:20:43,187 --> 01:20:45,189
We gotta play with more bullets.

695
01:20:45,231 --> 01:20:47,066
- What?
- More bullets.

696
01:20:49,401 --> 01:20:53,405
I gotta get more bullets
in the gun.

697
01:20:53,489 --> 01:20:55,950
- What?
- We gotta play with more bullets.

698
01:20:55,991 --> 01:20:58,202
- More bullets in the gun?
- More bullets in the gun.

699
01:20:58,202 --> 01:21:01,205
How many more bullets?

700
01:21:01,205 --> 01:21:03,499
Three.

701
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:13,676
That means we gotta play each other.

702
01:21:13,676 --> 01:21:16,679
- More bullets against each oth-
- We gotta do it.

703
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:19,682
- What? Are you crazy?
- Nicky, it's the only way.

704
01:21:22,184 --> 01:21:25,062
I'll pick the moment.
The game goes until I move.

705
01:21:25,062 --> 01:21:27,898
When I start shootin',
go for the nearest guard,

706
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:30,151
get his gun,
zap the fucker.

707
01:21:30,192 --> 01:21:33,279
- I'm not ready for this.
- You gotta listen to me.

708
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:35,489
You wanna stay
down here and die?

709
01:21:36,907 --> 01:21:40,077
Go on.
It's up to you.

710
01:21:40,119 --> 01:21:42,079
- Now it's up to you.
- No!

711
01:21:42,121 --> 01:21:44,081
- No!
- Hey, him against me!

712
01:21:44,123 --> 01:21:46,375
Side by side!

713
01:21:46,417 --> 01:21:51,589
- Side by side!
- Get away! Get away!

714
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:53,507
Me and him!
Me against him!

715
01:21:54,592 --> 01:21:59,221
Michael!

716
01:22:35,424 --> 01:22:39,094
Come on! These fuckers-

717
01:22:39,136 --> 01:22:41,722
These fuckers-
Go ahead, Nicky. Go ahead, Nicky.

718
01:22:41,764 --> 01:22:44,308
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.

719
01:22:44,350 --> 01:22:46,602
Go ahead. Go ahead, Nicky.

720
01:23:03,244 --> 01:23:05,538
I do three bullets.
Three.

721
01:23:05,538 --> 01:23:07,706
Three. We do three, huh?

722
01:23:07,706 --> 01:23:09,834
One, two, three.
Three.

723
01:23:20,219 --> 01:23:22,346
Three. Three.

724
01:23:28,144 --> 01:23:30,813
Three. Three.

725
01:23:33,941 --> 01:23:37,653
Don't worry. Five minutes,
we're gonna be outta here.

726
01:23:37,653 --> 01:23:39,530
We're gonna be outta here.

727
01:23:41,532 --> 01:23:43,451
Yeah.

728
01:23:49,623 --> 01:23:51,625
Now we got ourselves a game.

729
01:23:51,667 --> 01:23:53,586
You and me.
You and me.

730
01:23:53,627 --> 01:23:55,546
Now we got ourselves a game.

731
01:24:15,858 --> 01:24:18,110
Okay. Okay.

732
01:24:18,152 --> 01:24:20,154
You wanna see it?
All right.

733
01:24:23,949 --> 01:24:25,868
There.

734
01:24:34,168 --> 01:24:36,837
No more. No. No more.

735
01:24:42,051 --> 01:24:44,011
I'm gonna will us out of here.

736
01:24:44,053 --> 01:24:46,055
You got an empty chamber in that gun.

737
01:24:46,096 --> 01:24:48,057
Put an empty chamber
in that gun!

738
01:24:48,099 --> 01:24:51,060
Go ahead.

739
01:24:56,565 --> 01:24:58,609
Goddamn it!

740
01:24:58,651 --> 01:25:00,653
It's gonna be all right, Nicky.

741
01:25:00,694 --> 01:25:02,947
Go ahead, shoot!
Shoot, Nicky!

742
01:25:02,947 --> 01:25:05,157
Goddamn you,

743
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:08,536
You motherf-

744

No, no, no, no, Nicky!

745
01:25:12,573 --> 01:25:15,076
Oh! You cock-

746

Oh! Oh, you're gonna die,

747
01:25:18,162 --> 01:25:20,039
You're gonna die!

748
01:25:22,041 --> 01:25:24,002
Go ahead.
Go ahead, Nicky.

749

Just do it. Do it.
Do it! Do it!

01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:29,340
Go ahead!

751
01:25:34,846 --> 01:25:36,723
You made it.
You made it.

752
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:44,022
It's all right, Nicky.

753
01:25:44,022 --> 01:25:48,026
All right,
we're gonna show 'em.

754
01:25:48,735 --> 01:25:51,446
That's good, Nicky.

755
01:25:55,325 --> 01:25:59,329
All right. All right.

756
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:40,161
Come on, Nicky.
Come on.

757
01:26:40,203 --> 01:26:42,163
Come on! Nicky-

758
01:26:42,205 --> 01:26:44,707
Come on.

759
01:26:44,749 --> 01:26:47,877
Nicky, come on.
Damn it!

760
01:26:47,877 --> 01:26:49,879
Come on!

761
01:26:53,257 --> 01:26:55,259
Shit.

762
01:26:58,846 --> 01:27:01,474
Get me up.

763
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:05,353
Steve!

764
01:27:08,564 --> 01:27:10,566
Get up. Get up.

765
01:27:10,608 --> 01:27:12,485
Get up!

766
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:18,574
Michael. Michael.

767
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:22,078
Michael!

768
01:27:25,957 --> 01:27:27,959
Stevie, come on.
Come on, Stevie.

769
01:27:28,001 --> 01:27:29,961
We're gonna go for a swim.
Come on.

770
01:27:30,003 --> 01:27:32,255
Stevie.

771
01:27:32,255 --> 01:27:34,173
Come on. Come on.

772
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:41,264
We don't belong
here in the jungle, Michael.

773
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:45,351
Get on. Go on.
Just get on, see?

774
01:27:45,393 --> 01:27:50,481
- Just get on.
- There's rats in these waters.

775
01:27:50,523 --> 01:27:52,775
- These w-
- Hold on.

776
01:27:52,817 --> 01:27:55,069
Hold on right there.

777
01:27:55,111 --> 01:27:56,988
Hold on.

778
01:28:12,378 --> 01:28:14,589
- Michael.
- Okay, buddy.

779
01:28:20,970 --> 01:28:22,889
Mike.

780
01:28:28,686 --> 01:28:31,397
Nicky!

781
01:28:53,211 --> 01:28:56,673
Mike!

782
01:28:56,714 --> 01:28:58,716
I wanna go home, Mike.

783
01:30:01,821 --> 01:30:03,823
What is that sound?

784
01:30:05,325 --> 01:30:07,827
What's that sound, Michael?

785
01:30:20,506 --> 01:30:24,510
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

786
01:31:32,537 --> 01:31:34,539
Go ahead! Go ahead!

787
01:31:35,540 --> 01:31:37,792
Mike! Mike!

788
01:31:37,834 --> 01:31:40,837
Hold on, Michael! Don't let go!

789
01:31:42,338 --> 01:31:44,465
Mike!

790
01:31:49,345 --> 01:31:52,265
No! Mike!

791
01:32:30,178 --> 01:32:33,264
Stevie!

792
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:57,872
I hit some rocks, Michael.

793
01:32:57,914 --> 01:32:59,832
I hit some rocks.

794
01:32:59,874 --> 01:33:01,876
- Are you all right?
- Michael.

795
01:33:01,918 --> 01:33:04,253
- Okay.
- My legs-

796
01:33:06,381 --> 01:33:08,257
Come on. Come on.

797
01:33:09,676 --> 01:33:13,680
Stevie, come on.

798
01:33:19,185 --> 01:33:21,145
M- Mike,

799
01:33:21,187 --> 01:33:23,272
I hit some rocks.

800
01:33:24,273 --> 01:33:26,234
Okay.

801
01:33:26,275 --> 01:33:28,277
All right.

802
01:33:31,698 --> 01:33:33,658
That's it.

803
01:33:33,658 --> 01:33:36,077
- That's it.
- My arm.

804
01:33:38,079 --> 01:33:41,499
I can't feel my legs.

805
01:33:42,583 --> 01:33:44,961
All right. Come on.

806
01:33:53,970 --> 01:33:56,472
Push yourself up.

807
01:34:08,776 --> 01:34:13,364
Shh!

808
01:34:13,406 --> 01:34:17,410
Okay. Okay, kid. Okay.

809
01:34:17,493 --> 01:34:21,497
Shh! Shh!

810
01:36:42,430 --> 01:36:44,349
Hi.

811
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:50,938
Hi.

812
01:37:57,046 --> 01:37:59,048
Ah.

813
01:38:05,263 --> 01:38:08,349
Are you Nikanor Chevotarevich?

814
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,062
Can you understand me, Nikanor?

815
01:38:16,357 --> 01:38:18,443
Excuse me?

816
01:38:18,484 --> 01:38:21,612
- Are you Chevotarevich? Are you sure?
- Yes.

817
01:38:21,654 --> 01:38:24,782
Uh-huh. Chevotarevich.
Is that a Russian name?

818
01:38:28,077 --> 01:38:31,039
No. It's American.

819
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:33,249
All right.
Let me see your name tag.

820
01:38:35,585 --> 01:38:39,547
- This yours?
- It's his.

821
01:38:39,589 --> 01:38:45,470
- What are your parents' names?
- Lou and, uh-

822
01:38:45,511 --> 01:38:49,432
My mother's name is, uh-

823
01:38:49,474 --> 01:38:53,353
- Tsk. Eva.
- Uh-huh.

824
01:38:53,353 --> 01:38:56,356
And what are your parents'
dates of birth?

825
01:39:03,696 --> 01:39:08,576
What the-

826
01:39:41,693 --> 01:39:45,697
We're gonna have
to get him outta here.

827
01:40:14,017 --> 01:40:15,893
Sure, sure.

828
01:40:17,687 --> 01:40:20,189
Excuse me.

829
01:40:22,108 --> 01:40:26,612
Some more noise, uh-huh.

830
01:40:26,654 --> 01:40:29,198
Hello?

831
01:40:30,199 --> 01:40:34,495
Uh, I'm calling
the United States.

832
01:40:36,122 --> 01:40:39,125
Clairton, Pennsylvania.

833
01:40:41,419 --> 01:40:45,340
C- L-A...

834
01:40:45,381 --> 01:40:49,260
I- R-T-O-N.

835
01:40:49,302 --> 01:40:52,972
Pennsylvania. Right.

836
01:40:52,972 --> 01:40:56,601
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

837
01:41:00,521 --> 01:41:02,982
Never mind.

838
01:41:03,024 --> 01:41:06,027
Nothing, nothing.
No. Never mind. Nothing.

839
01:41:15,828 --> 01:41:19,832
Hey, back off, Jack!
Back off.

840
01:41:20,124 --> 01:41:24,128
Well, just do that.

841
01:42:08,047 --> 01:42:10,008
Mike?

842
01:42:10,049 --> 01:42:12,051
Hello. How are you?

843
01:42:12,051 --> 01:42:14,053
- Hey.
- Mike?

844
01:42:16,848 --> 01:42:20,852
Mike? Hey, Mike.

845
01:42:20,935 --> 01:42:24,147
Sorry. I thought
you were someone else.

846
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:43,124
- "Too much for the man"
- "Too much for the man"

847
01:42:43,166 --> 01:42:45,293
"He couldn't make it"

848
01:42:45,335 --> 01:42:49,339
"So he's leavin'
the life he's"

849
01:42:49,422 --> 01:42:52,050
"He's come to know"

850
01:42:52,091 --> 01:42:54,010
"Ooh, ooh"

851
01:42:54,052 --> 01:42:59,265
- "He said he's goin'"
- "He said he's going back to find"

852
01:42:59,265 --> 01:43:01,225
"Going back to find"

853
01:43:01,267 --> 01:43:04,646
"Ooh, ooh, ooh
What's left of his world"

854
01:43:06,731 --> 01:43:10,360
"The world he left behind"

855
01:43:10,401 --> 01:43:15,198
"Not so long ago"

856
01:43:15,239 --> 01:43:18,242
- How are you?
- Okay.

857
01:43:18,284 --> 01:43:20,411
"He's leavin'"

858
01:43:20,453 --> 01:43:26,334
- "On that midnight train to Georgia"
- I show you. Come.

859
01:43:26,376 --> 01:43:29,420
- "Yeah"
- Not like the girls home in U.S.A.

860
01:43:29,462 --> 01:43:32,423
- I make you crazy.
- "Goin' back to find"

861
01:43:32,465 --> 01:43:35,927
- "To a simpler place and time"
- I make you crazy.

862
01:43:35,969 --> 01:43:38,638
- "Oh, yes, he is"
- "Guess who's gonna be right by his side"

863
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:42,433
- No, I don't wanna.
- Come.

864
01:43:42,475 --> 01:43:46,980
"Leavin' on that
midnight train to Georgia"

865
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:50,108
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah"

866
01:43:50,149 --> 01:43:53,403
"I'd rather live in his world"

867
01:43:53,444 --> 01:43:56,656
"Than live without him in mine"

868
01:44:00,076 --> 01:44:02,745
"Mmm, L.A."

869
01:44:02,787 --> 01:44:05,456
Come on inside.

870
01:44:14,966 --> 01:44:19,387
Okay, what you like
call me now, hmm?

871
01:44:19,387 --> 01:44:22,932
What you like call me?

872
01:44:22,974 --> 01:44:25,685
- Linda.
- Linda. Just like home.

873
01:44:25,727 --> 01:44:28,855
No, no.
Thank you.

874
01:44:28,855 --> 01:44:32,150
Come back here.
Come back here.

875
01:44:32,191 --> 01:44:36,863
- Call- Call- Call me Linda.
- Hey, look.

876
01:44:36,904 --> 01:44:40,158
Elephants.

877
01:44:40,158 --> 01:44:42,660
I gotta get an elephant.

878
01:44:42,702 --> 01:44:45,246
No!

879
01:44:45,288 --> 01:44:47,790
I can't stay here in a room
with a kid cryin'.

880
01:44:47,832 --> 01:44:49,959
- Come on.
- No. No!

881
01:44:49,959 --> 01:44:53,963
Why don't you pay me first?
Fuck you!

882
01:44:56,174 --> 01:45:01,179
Oh. Oh.

883
01:45:04,474 --> 01:45:07,101
"The snow does snow"

884
01:45:07,101 --> 01:45:09,646
"The rain does rain"

885
01:45:09,687 --> 01:45:12,190
"The wind does blow"

886
01:45:13,775 --> 01:45:16,486
"The rain does rain"

887
01:45:16,527 --> 01:45:18,863
"The snow does snow"

888
01:45:18,905 --> 01:45:21,199
"The wind does blow"

889
01:46:13,293 --> 01:46:16,004
You seem disturbed.

890
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:32,770
People inside
doing it for money?

891
01:46:32,812 --> 01:46:36,357
Sometime a great deal of money.

892
01:46:36,399 --> 01:46:39,193
I cannot play
this kind of game myself.

893
01:46:39,235 --> 01:46:42,697
But I'm always-
How do you say?

894
01:46:42,697 --> 01:46:47,493
Looking out for those things
quite different, quite rare.

895
01:46:49,203 --> 01:46:52,123
Champagne, perhaps?

896
01:46:52,165 --> 01:46:54,083
No.

897
01:46:54,125 --> 01:46:57,879
Tsk, tsk. Don't say no.

898
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:01,924
When a man say no to champagne,
he say no to life.

899
01:47:06,304 --> 01:47:08,931
You saw this before?

900
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:13,478
Up north.

901
01:47:13,519 --> 01:47:15,897
Oh, yes. Of course.

902
01:47:15,938 --> 01:47:20,943
- Gotta go.
- But you must come in.

903
01:47:20,943 --> 01:47:23,529
I insist.

904
01:47:26,407 --> 01:47:31,037
Of what is there to be afraid of
after this war? War is a joke.

905
01:47:31,079 --> 01:47:33,706
- A silly thing.
- I'm going home, ace!

906
01:47:33,748 --> 01:47:36,709
Naturellement
I pay my players...

907
01:47:36,751 --> 01:47:39,879
cash, American.

908
01:47:39,921 --> 01:47:44,926
However, should you prefer German marks
or perhaps Swiss franc,

909
01:47:44,968 --> 01:47:47,011
that, of course,
can be arranged.

910
01:47:47,011 --> 01:47:50,014
- I can arrange everything.
- You got the wrong guy, ace.

911
01:47:50,056 --> 01:47:52,517
- But you must come in.
- Don't do that.

912
01:47:52,558 --> 01:47:55,144
But I insist.

913
01:49:13,348 --> 01:49:15,058
Nick!

914
01:49:36,954 --> 01:49:38,081
Hey, Nick!

915
01:50:02,689 --> 01:50:05,692
Hey! Nick! Nick!

916
01:50:06,985 --> 01:50:11,489
- Listen, if you are very brave and lucky,
- Hey, Nick!

917
01:50:11,489 --> 01:50:14,492
I can make you
very, very rich.

918
01:50:50,069 --> 01:50:53,573
Wow. Would you
look at that?

919
01:50:55,575 --> 01:50:58,369
- Just keep goin'. Just keep goin'.
- You said Logan Street.

920
01:50:58,411 --> 01:51:01,205
- I just want to keep goin'.
- The trailer. It's right there.

921
01:51:01,205 --> 01:51:04,500
Just wait 'til Michael
gets here, huh?

922
01:51:04,542 --> 01:51:07,879
This is it!
This is Michael!

923
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:10,048
- Oh!
- All right.

924
01:51:10,089 --> 01:51:14,093
Everybody, stay where you are!
I'll go get him.

925
01:51:14,177 --> 01:51:16,512
Three cheers
for the red, white and blue.

926
01:51:16,512 --> 01:51:20,475
Hip, hip, hurray!
Hip, hip, hurray!

927
01:51:20,683 --> 01:51:24,604
Hip, hip, hurray!

928
01:51:30,276 --> 01:51:33,196
- That cab ain't stoppin'.
- What's goin' on?

929
01:51:36,991 --> 01:51:41,871
I can't wait for him
to see all this stuff.

930
01:51:41,913 --> 01:51:45,667
- What happened?
- Hey, Stosh, what happened? I thought it was him.

931
01:51:45,708 --> 01:51:51,589
So his plane could be late.
Take it easy, will ya, Axel? You're drivin' everyone nuts.

932
01:51:54,217 --> 01:51:56,386
You okay?

933
01:52:03,810 --> 01:52:06,980
I know Nick will be back soon.

934
01:52:07,021 --> 01:52:11,401
I know Nick.
He'll be comin' back too.

935
01:52:11,442 --> 01:52:14,779
- Right, Axel?
- Fuckin' A.

936
01:52:14,821 --> 01:52:19,409
- Go straight on down to the highway.
- It's your bread, man.

937
01:56:01,881 --> 01:56:04,092
It's open!

938
01:56:17,563 --> 01:56:21,567
Forget something-
Michael?

939
01:56:23,069 --> 01:56:27,949
Oh, Michael! Oh!

940
01:56:27,991 --> 01:56:31,995
Oh, Michael!
Oh, Michael!

941
01:56:32,286 --> 01:56:34,580
Tsk! Oh, my God.

942
01:56:34,622 --> 01:56:38,251
Oh, gee.

943
01:56:38,293 --> 01:56:41,546
Gee, you look beautiful.

944
01:56:41,587 --> 01:56:45,341
Oh, uh, let me
take your coat.

945
01:56:45,383 --> 01:56:49,053
Oh! Everybody was here.
You missed them all.

946
01:56:49,095 --> 01:56:54,892
Oh. They're gonna be so mad
when they find out they missed you.

947
01:56:58,688 --> 01:57:00,606
Welcome home.

948
01:57:06,279 --> 01:57:08,781
You know, I was hopin'-

949
01:57:08,781 --> 01:57:14,203
I was hopin' somehow, Michael,
maybe you had... Nick with you.

950
01:57:14,245 --> 01:57:18,708
No. No.

951
01:57:26,799 --> 01:57:29,302
You hear anything on Nick?

952
01:57:31,512 --> 01:57:33,598
No.

953
01:57:35,516 --> 01:57:37,644
Nothing.
He's A.W.O.L.

954
01:57:37,685 --> 01:57:39,812
That's all we know.

955
01:57:39,854 --> 01:57:42,273
Tsk.

956
01:57:42,315 --> 01:57:43,983
He'll be back.

957
01:57:44,025 --> 01:57:48,404
He never wrote to me.
He never called me.

958
01:57:48,446 --> 01:57:50,406
Maybe you were out.

959
01:57:52,617 --> 01:57:54,494
Yeah. Maybe.

960
01:57:59,999 --> 01:58:02,168
So how are you anyway?

961
01:58:02,210 --> 01:58:05,129
I'm fine. Okay.
How are you?

962
01:58:05,129 --> 01:58:08,591
Uh, me? I'm okay.

963
01:58:08,633 --> 01:58:10,677
I'm fine.
I go along, you know.

964
01:58:10,718 --> 01:58:15,598
Still workin' at the market there.
There's a million things to do.

965
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:18,977
Y- You sure
you're all right, huh?

966
01:58:19,018 --> 01:58:22,480
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- What about your wounds?

967
01:58:22,522 --> 01:58:27,402
It was nothin'.
Just the usual complications, that's all.

968
01:58:27,402 --> 01:58:31,406
- We heard.
- No, that's not true, a lot of guys go through it.

969
01:58:31,531 --> 01:58:35,535
Hmm. Tsk.

970
01:58:35,827 --> 01:58:39,205
I made Nick that sweater.

971
01:58:45,211 --> 01:58:48,589
I couldn't remember
the exact size, but-

972
01:58:48,631 --> 01:58:51,718
I think he's about
the same size as you, huh?

973
01:58:54,637 --> 01:58:59,600
No. Too big. Whoops.

974
01:58:59,642 --> 01:59:02,895
Well, I could fix that, though.
I mean-

975
01:59:02,937 --> 01:59:05,732
One thing about wool,
it's really a cinch...

976
01:59:08,818 --> 01:59:11,029
to fix.

977
01:59:11,070 --> 01:59:13,239
Oh, Christ.

978
01:59:16,117 --> 01:59:20,121
It's okay.

979
01:59:24,042 --> 01:59:26,002
It's okay.

980
01:59:26,044 --> 01:59:30,089
- How's your job?
- Great. Fine. Yeah.

981
01:59:30,131 --> 01:59:34,135
Once or twice
we almost had to close.

982
01:59:34,177 --> 01:59:36,054
I gotta go to work now.

983
01:59:37,847 --> 01:59:40,016
- Gotta go now?
- Yeah.

984
01:59:40,058 --> 01:59:44,854
Uh, would you mind
if I walked you to work?

985
01:59:46,356 --> 01:59:51,402
Mikie, you're so... weird.

986
01:59:51,444 --> 01:59:54,656
You're always such a gentleman.

987
01:59:54,697 --> 01:59:56,949
Tsk. Well-

988
02:00:01,829 --> 02:00:03,957
- It's cold out there.
- Yeah.

989
02:00:03,998 --> 02:00:06,918
I'm not used to it.

990
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:10,546
Oh, I'm so glad you're alive.

991
02:00:10,588 --> 02:00:13,549
I'm so happy.

992
02:00:14,968 --> 02:00:17,470
I really don't know
what I feel.

993
02:00:46,666 --> 02:00:49,252
- Hey, Jack.
- Hello. How are you?

994
02:01:10,273 --> 02:01:13,776
Linda, uh,
I just want to say...

995
02:01:13,818 --> 02:01:16,321
how sorry I am about Nick.

996
02:01:16,362 --> 02:01:20,867
And how- I know how much
you loved him and...

997
02:01:20,908 --> 02:01:24,662
I know that it'll
never be the same.

998
02:01:24,704 --> 02:01:28,041
I just wanted
to tell you that.

999
02:01:28,082 --> 02:01:32,086
Maybe- I don't know-
Maybe you don't want to talk about it.

1000
02:01:47,060 --> 02:01:51,564
How's it goin', hot lips?

1001
02:01:51,564 --> 02:01:55,985
Yeah, a new kid.
A real tough guy.

1002
02:01:57,195 --> 02:01:59,572
It's okay.

1003
02:02:00,698 --> 02:02:03,660
Mike.

1004
02:02:03,701 --> 02:02:07,372
Why don't you come in with me?
Just say hello.

1005
02:02:07,413 --> 02:02:11,084
Oh, Mike, please.
They want to see you. I know.

1006
02:02:11,125 --> 02:02:13,252
Just for a second, okay?
Okay.

1007
02:02:13,294 --> 02:02:17,298
Hey, look who's here.
It's Michael. Hey, everybody.

1008
02:02:19,092 --> 02:02:23,096
- Oh, Michael, I read about you in the paper.
- Helen!

1009
02:02:23,179 --> 02:02:26,140
- Let me-
- Oh, Michael. Oh, dear.

1010
02:02:26,182 --> 02:02:28,893
- Doesn't he look terrific, Janie?
- Hi, Michael.

1011
02:02:28,935 --> 02:02:30,937
- Mike!
- How beautiful you look.

1012
02:02:30,979 --> 02:02:35,400
- You look good, Mike. Welcome back.
- We're glad he's home.

1013
02:02:35,441 --> 02:02:39,112
- Wait a minute. Look at his medals.
- Congratulations.

1014
02:02:39,112 --> 02:02:42,573
- There's gotta be 20.
- Oh, Michael.

1015
02:02:42,615 --> 02:02:46,577
- Helen! Come on.
- Janie, leave me alone.

1016
02:02:46,619 --> 02:02:50,581
We really won over there,
huh, Mike? We won.

1017
02:02:50,581 --> 02:02:55,712
- I have to go to work now.
- We better- Good seeing you.

1018
02:02:55,753 --> 02:02:59,215
- See ya, Michael. See ya, Michael.
- Come see us.

1019
02:02:59,215 --> 02:03:01,676
Bye.

1020
02:03:01,718 --> 02:03:04,345
- Can I see you later?
- Okay.

1021
02:03:04,387 --> 02:03:07,015
- After work?
- Yeah. Where?

1022
02:03:07,056 --> 02:03:10,184
- Home?
- Home? Okay.

1023
02:03:40,006 --> 02:03:42,383
- One beer at John's. One beer.
- One?

1024
02:03:42,383 --> 02:03:44,719
- Uh-
- Come on. I'll buy ya a beer.

1025
02:03:44,761 --> 02:03:46,929
I'm in. All right.

1026
02:03:46,971 --> 02:03:49,098
Hey, Axel. Hey, Stosh. Axhead.

1027
02:03:49,140 --> 02:03:51,976

02:03:52,018 --> 02:03:55,229

02:03:55,271 --> 02:03:58,107
Hey, man. How ya doin'?
Hey, where was you?

1030
02:03:58,149 --> 02:03:59,984
- Where was you?
- Where were you?

1031
02:04:00,026 --> 02:04:02,320
We had everything all set there.
Beer, food.

1032
02:04:02,362 --> 02:04:07,116
- Fuckin' A.
- I got delayed.

1033
02:04:07,158 --> 02:04:09,911

- Hey-

1034
02:04:11,037 --> 02:04:14,123
- You got a mustache.
- Yeah.

1035
02:04:14,165 --> 02:04:16,209
Looks pretty good.

1036
02:04:16,209 --> 02:04:19,671
- It looks cute.
- Yeah, it looks-

1037
02:04:19,712 --> 02:04:23,132
Come on.
We're goin' to John's.

1038
02:04:23,174 --> 02:04:26,678
So how you guys been?

1039
02:04:26,719 --> 02:04:29,097
Hangin' in there.
You know.

1040
02:04:29,097 --> 02:04:31,432
How's it feel to be shot?

1041
02:04:31,474 --> 02:04:34,602
- It don't.
- Oh.

1042
02:04:34,644 --> 02:04:37,313
It don't hurt.
If that's what you wanna know.

1043
02:04:37,355 --> 02:04:40,233
How youse been?
Been okay?

1044
02:04:40,274 --> 02:04:42,986
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1045
02:04:43,027 --> 02:04:46,698
Same old thing, you know.
Nothing's changed.

1046
02:04:46,739 --> 02:04:50,535
I'm gettin' more ass than a toilet seat,
and Axel's gettin' fatter than ever.

1047
02:04:50,576 --> 02:04:56,249
Hey! Hey, Stan,
why don't you show him that gun?

1048
02:04:56,291 --> 02:04:58,793
Shh! Take it easy.

1049
02:04:58,835 --> 02:05:01,129
That little pussy thing you carry
around back there. Look at that.

1050
02:05:01,170 --> 02:05:03,506
- Watch it.
- What's that for?

1051
02:05:03,548 --> 02:05:06,050
- Same thing the other one was for.
- And what was that for?

1052
02:05:06,092 --> 02:05:08,303
- He's a worrier.
- Ah, forget it.

1053
02:05:08,344 --> 02:05:10,555
- Let's go have a drink.
- Yeah, let's get a drink.

1054
02:05:10,555 --> 02:05:12,515
"So long time forgotten"

1055
02:05:12,557 --> 02:05:17,353
- "Seems a good spell that I loved you"
- Look what I found.

1056
02:05:17,395 --> 02:05:19,397
Hey, Mikie!

1057
02:05:19,439 --> 02:05:23,151
Let this man through!
Let him through!

1058
02:05:25,737 --> 02:05:28,865
Hey, John!
Good to see ya!

1059
02:05:28,865 --> 02:05:32,827
Boy, oh, boy!

1060
02:05:32,952 --> 02:05:35,038
Come on.
Come on in the back.

1061
02:05:35,079 --> 02:05:41,544
In the back.
Come on!

1062
02:05:44,631 --> 02:05:46,799
What the hell's
goin' on here?

1063
02:05:46,841 --> 02:05:50,470
- Goddamn.
- Stosh, get the glasses on the sink.

1064
02:05:50,470 --> 02:05:54,057
- The dirty ones?
- Yeah, use the dirty ones.

1065
02:05:54,098 --> 02:05:57,060
Holy shit! What did you do?

1066
02:05:57,101 --> 02:06:00,021
Win the war
all by yourself?

1067
02:06:00,063 --> 02:06:02,065
- Look at this stuff.
- No help from you.

1068
02:06:02,106 --> 02:06:03,816
- Huh?
- Here we go!

1069
02:06:03,858 --> 02:06:08,655
Misha. Na zdorovije.
To you, Mike.

1070
02:06:08,696 --> 02:06:11,115
Na zdorovije to everybody.

1071
02:06:11,157 --> 02:06:13,451
- Fuckin' A.
- Na zdorovije!

1072
02:06:13,493 --> 02:06:16,162
- Na zdorovije!
- Hey! Hey!

1073
02:06:16,204 --> 02:06:18,831
Wait, wait!
To Nick and Steve!

1074
02:06:18,873 --> 02:06:21,960
- To Nick and Steve.
- Nick and Steve.

1075
02:06:33,846 --> 02:06:36,474
You look great.

1076
02:06:40,561 --> 02:06:42,772
How's Angela?

1077
02:06:47,986 --> 02:06:52,448
- Not so good, Mike, worse since she talked to him.
- Talked to who?

1078
02:06:52,490 --> 02:06:54,117
Steven.

1079
02:06:54,158 --> 02:06:57,662
She talked to Steve?
I didn't know he was back.

1080
02:06:57,704 --> 02:07:00,873
- You didn't know he's back?
- Oh, Jesus.

1081
02:07:00,915 --> 02:07:04,252
No, I didn't know.
Is he back?

1082
02:07:04,294 --> 02:07:07,672
- You- You- You didn't-
- Where is he? Where is he?

1083
02:07:07,714 --> 02:07:09,257
- Come on, John.
- Come on.

1084
02:07:09,299 --> 02:07:10,633
Where is he?

1085
02:07:10,675 --> 02:07:12,844
- I don't know.
- Just answer me. Where is he?

1086
02:07:12,885 --> 02:07:16,264
- Just tell me where he is?
- I don't know where he is, Mike.

1087
02:07:16,306 --> 02:07:20,184
- Angela wouldn't tell us. Mike.
- What do you mean?

1088
02:07:20,226 --> 02:07:22,270
She wouldn't talk to anybody!

1089
02:07:22,312 --> 02:07:24,564
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

1090
02:07:46,502 --> 02:07:48,504
Boom!

1091
02:08:00,892 --> 02:08:02,977
Angela.

1092
02:08:04,979 --> 02:08:08,983
I heard Steven was alive.
Where is he?

1093
02:08:13,780 --> 02:08:15,907
Where's Steven?

1094
02:08:18,201 --> 02:08:22,205
Where is he?
Just tell me where it is.

1095
02:08:25,208 --> 02:08:27,251
Angela, where is Steve?

1096
02:08:27,293 --> 02:08:32,006
- Uh, uh-
- Just tell me where he is.

1097
02:08:33,883 --> 02:08:39,597
Where is he?

1098
02:08:39,639 --> 02:08:43,059
Please.

1099
02:08:43,101 --> 02:08:46,396
You gotta tell me.
Now where is he?

1100
02:08:46,437 --> 02:08:49,691
Do you know?
Where is he?

1101
02:09:20,513 --> 02:09:22,598
Take care.

1102
02:10:10,438 --> 02:10:12,982
Michael?

1103
02:10:13,024 --> 02:10:15,485
Right here.

1104
02:10:15,526 --> 02:10:18,112
- Whatcha doin'?
- Nothin'.

1105
02:10:18,112 --> 02:10:20,531
Just got my gear,
and I was gonna go.

1106
02:10:20,573 --> 02:10:22,492
- What?
- I was gonna go.

1107
02:10:22,533 --> 02:10:25,328
Don't go.
I have, uh, all this food.

1108
02:10:25,370 --> 02:10:28,122
I'll make you
a nice sit-down dinner.

1109
02:10:28,164 --> 02:10:31,626
- I-I can't.
- Mikie.

1110
02:10:37,256 --> 02:10:39,342
Why don't we go to bed?

1111
02:10:43,429 --> 02:10:47,433
C- Can't we just comfort
each other?

1112
02:10:47,558 --> 02:10:51,521
No, I can't. Not here.
I gotta get outta here.

1113
02:10:51,729 --> 02:10:54,190
Sorry.
I just gotta get out.

1114
02:10:54,232 --> 02:10:56,609
I'll be-
Look, I don't know.

1115
02:10:56,651 --> 02:11:00,947
I feel a lot of distance,
and I feel far away. I'll see ya later.

1116
02:11:36,274 --> 02:11:40,236
It feels kind of weird...

1117
02:11:40,278 --> 02:11:42,530
comin' to a motel.

1118
02:11:42,572 --> 02:11:44,574
You know what I mean, Michael?

1119
02:11:44,574 --> 02:11:48,578
Mike?

1120
02:12:43,091 --> 02:12:45,718
Go ahead.

1121
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:49,764
I got to put my can down
for this one.

1122
02:12:49,806 --> 02:12:53,768
Ha! Ha!

1123
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:06,364
"Here we are
staring at each other"

1124
02:13:09,075 --> 02:13:14,998
"With that crazy look
in our eyes"

1125
02:13:14,998 --> 02:13:17,667
Michael, it's on the house.

1126
02:13:17,667 --> 02:13:20,295
- "It happens every time"
- No, thanks.

1127
02:13:20,336 --> 02:13:24,299
"We get together"

1128
02:13:26,175 --> 02:13:32,098
"Did we ever really
say good-bye"

1129
02:13:32,140 --> 02:13:35,601
How ya feelin'?
You okay?

1130
02:13:35,643 --> 02:13:38,855
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1131
02:13:38,896 --> 02:13:43,484
"Then our eyes keep looking
at each other"

1132
02:13:43,526 --> 02:13:47,488
All right!

1133
02:13:47,697 --> 02:13:50,158
Yea, Linda!

1134
02:13:50,199 --> 02:13:54,203
- What do you think of her, Mike?
- I don't know.

1135
02:13:54,412 --> 02:13:58,416
- No, come on. On the level.
- I don't know, Stosh.

1136
02:13:58,499 --> 02:14:02,128
Is she-
Is she beautiful?

1137
02:14:02,170 --> 02:14:05,798
Is she beautiful? Is she?

1138
02:14:09,093 --> 02:14:11,095
- The truth?
- Yeah!

1139
02:14:11,137 --> 02:14:13,139
No.

1140
02:14:13,139 --> 02:14:15,058
No?

1141
02:14:15,099 --> 02:14:19,103
- No.
- Well, do you think she's intelligent?

1142
02:14:19,187 --> 02:14:24,317
- No.
- Neither do I.

1143
02:14:30,198 --> 02:14:32,992
I don't think
she's intelligent either.

1144
02:14:32,992 --> 02:14:38,122
- What the hell you see in her?
- I don't know, that's what I came to ask you.

1145
02:14:38,164 --> 02:14:41,626
- Maybe she's good in bed.
- Why don't you ask her?

1146
02:14:45,922 --> 02:14:49,092
Whoa!

1147
02:14:49,092 --> 02:14:52,470
"Oh, it's somethin'"

1148
02:14:52,512 --> 02:14:56,224
"How they read
between the lines"

1149
02:14:59,310 --> 02:15:04,315
"Tattletale eyes
tell what's on our minds"

1150
02:15:07,527 --> 02:15:10,405
Now where the fuck
is my fuckin' ball?

1151
02:15:10,446 --> 02:15:12,490
Goddamn pinsetter!

1152
02:15:12,532 --> 02:15:15,702
- "Tattletale eyes"
- Where's he goin'?

1153
02:15:15,743 --> 02:15:18,204
Axel! Axel!

1154
02:15:23,418 --> 02:15:25,336
Michael!

1155
02:15:29,424 --> 02:15:32,468
What the hell happened?

1156
02:15:32,510 --> 02:15:36,806
- The pinsetter came down.
- Stan, get the jack out of my trunk.

1157
02:15:40,310 --> 02:15:43,646
Shit. Nothin' works
around this damn place anymore.

1158
02:15:43,646 --> 02:15:46,107
We're gettin' you clear here.

1159
02:15:46,149 --> 02:15:48,735
Watch your elbow here.
All right, you got it.

1160
02:15:48,776 --> 02:15:51,154
All right, belly burn.

1161
02:15:51,195 --> 02:15:54,365
You all right, man?

1162
02:15:54,407 --> 02:15:57,535
- Hey!
- Fuckin' A!

1163
02:15:58,244 --> 02:16:00,913
What do you guys
want to do now, huh?

1164
02:16:00,913 --> 02:16:03,833
- We're goin' huntin', right?
- Who asked you?

1165
02:16:03,875 --> 02:16:06,753
- Who the hell asked you?
- I was askin' Mike.

1166
02:16:06,753 --> 02:16:09,714
- He's goin'.
- Yeah, Mike's goin'.

1167
02:16:09,756 --> 02:16:13,718
- But no women.
- Just like old times, hey, am I right?

1168
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:17,722
- Just like old times?
- Fuckin' A!

1169
02:17:50,064 --> 02:17:52,233
Are you kiddin' me, Axel?

1170
02:17:52,275 --> 02:17:56,029
Forty times
we could've had it!

1171
02:17:56,070 --> 02:17:59,782
If I'd have been
where you are.

1172
02:18:09,459 --> 02:18:13,880
Go get 'im, Axel!

1173
02:18:15,590 --> 02:18:17,467
Fuck you guys.

1174
02:18:37,487 --> 02:18:41,824
- Oh, how sweet it is.
- Fuckin' A.

1175
02:18:41,866 --> 02:18:46,162
Jesus Christ.
What the hell is that?

1176
02:18:46,204 --> 02:18:50,541
Hey!

1177
02:18:50,583 --> 02:18:54,587
Hey! Hey, John!
Axel! I got one!

1178
02:18:57,674 --> 02:19:01,469
Hey, fellas! I got one!

1179
02:19:48,016 --> 02:19:49,892
Okay?

1180
02:20:19,505 --> 02:20:24,719
Okay!

1181
02:20:39,400 --> 02:20:42,320
What's that stupid little gun
doin' up here?

1182
02:20:45,823 --> 02:20:47,784
In case.

1183
02:20:47,825 --> 02:20:50,787
In case?
In case of what?

1184
02:20:50,828 --> 02:20:52,830
In case you stumble
on one of your girlfriends...

1185
02:20:52,872 --> 02:20:55,333
sucking on
a forest ranger's cock?

1186
02:20:56,626 --> 02:20:59,712
You say that one more time.

1187
02:20:59,754 --> 02:21:02,799
Say it!
Go on. Say it!

1188
02:21:02,840 --> 02:21:05,927
Stanley, you're so full of shit
you're gonna float away.

1189
02:21:05,969 --> 02:21:07,804
Try me!
You try me!

1190
02:21:07,804 --> 02:21:09,806
- Just say it!
- You're gonna float away.

1191
02:21:09,847 --> 02:21:13,309
- Easy, Mike.
- Ow! Hey!

1192
02:21:13,309 --> 02:21:15,812
- Take it easy, Mike.
- What the hell was that for?

1193
02:21:15,853 --> 02:21:18,731
What? You think it was loaded?
Gimme that.

1194
02:21:23,820 --> 02:21:26,239
Don't.

1195
02:21:32,328 --> 02:21:36,249
You wanna play games?
All right, I'll play your fuckin' games.

1196
02:21:39,708 --> 02:21:41,710
- Hey!
- How do you feel now?

1197
02:21:41,751 --> 02:21:45,005
Huh? Huh?

1198
02:21:45,005 --> 02:21:49,009
- Hey!
- Big shot!

1199
02:23:11,258 --> 02:23:13,301
Hi, Michael!

1200
02:23:13,343 --> 02:23:15,428
- Linda's in back.
- She's in the back?

1201
02:23:15,470 --> 02:23:18,431
- Yeah. Hey, how was the hunting?
- It was fine. Thanks.

1202
02:23:29,859 --> 02:23:32,070
Linda, what's the matter?

1203
02:23:35,365 --> 02:23:37,367
I don't know.

1204
02:23:39,953 --> 02:23:42,289
What's the matter?

1205
02:23:42,330 --> 02:23:44,666
Noth-
I don't know.

1206
02:23:49,546 --> 02:23:51,548
Well, it's gotta be somethin'.

1207
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:57,929
I got the car outside.

1208
02:23:57,929 --> 02:24:00,056
Yeah. Well, that's okay.

1209
02:24:01,349 --> 02:24:03,310
You sure?

1210
02:24:03,351 --> 02:24:05,854
No, it's okay.
Just leave me alone, okay?

1211
02:24:07,981 --> 02:24:09,858
Really.

1212
02:24:24,956 --> 02:24:27,918
Have a nice night.

1213
02:24:27,959 --> 02:24:30,754
Good night!
See you tomorrow.

1214
02:24:36,092 --> 02:24:38,261
Come with me.
We'll get you home.

1215
02:24:40,972 --> 02:24:43,016
No. I think
I'll go with him.

1216
02:24:43,058 --> 02:24:45,060
- Okay? Thanks.
- Well, okay.

1217
02:24:54,486 --> 02:24:58,198
You okay?

1218
02:25:00,575 --> 02:25:03,495
Did you ever think life
would turn out like this?

1219
02:25:06,498 --> 02:25:08,375
No.

1220
02:27:40,026 --> 02:27:41,945
"I" 27.

1221
02:27:45,448 --> 02:27:48,076
- "N" 40.
- Bingo!

1222
02:27:48,118 --> 02:27:52,038
We have a bingo.
Johnny-come-lately.

1223
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:54,416
Where are you, Johnny?

1224
02:27:54,457 --> 02:27:56,418
There you are.

1225
02:27:56,418 --> 02:27:58,920
- "B" 15. "I" 16.
- Right.

1226
02:27:58,962 --> 02:28:00,964
- Right.
- "N" 33.

1227
02:28:01,006 --> 02:28:02,882
- Right.
- "G" 60.

1228
02:28:02,924 --> 02:28:05,719
We- Yeah.
That's a winner.

1229
02:28:05,719 --> 02:28:08,138
Get outta my road there,
Ivan Stivan.

1230
02:28:08,179 --> 02:28:10,640
I can't see myself smokin'.

1231
02:28:10,682 --> 02:28:13,768
And the next number: "I" 16.

1232
02:28:13,810 --> 02:28:16,855
Wish it was I.
Nice sweet 16.

1233
02:28:16,855 --> 02:28:18,815
"I" 18.

1234
02:28:18,857 --> 02:28:21,151
Then you become a man.

1235
02:28:21,192 --> 02:28:23,403
Let's go, men. "G" 60.

1236
02:28:23,445 --> 02:28:25,822
And those that can't
help themselves,

1237
02:28:25,864 --> 02:28:28,325
please, buddy,
help them too.

1238
02:28:28,325 --> 02:28:30,744
Oh, will you dance with me?

1239
02:28:30,785 --> 02:28:33,622
"G" 47.

1240
02:28:33,663 --> 02:28:37,626
But I'm still satisfied
with what I've got,

1241
02:28:37,751 --> 02:28:39,836
that wonderful life I've lived.

1242
02:28:39,878 --> 02:28:42,380
Think it over, buddy boys,

1243
02:28:42,380 --> 02:28:44,841
and I'll give you "O" 61.

1244
02:28:49,262 --> 02:28:51,848
Hi. How ya doin'?

1245
02:28:51,890 --> 02:28:53,767
Hi.

1246
02:28:56,269 --> 02:28:59,356
Steven, there's a call for you.

1247
02:28:59,397 --> 02:29:01,233
Maybe it's from Angela.

1248
02:29:29,552 --> 02:29:32,764
- Hello.
- Stevie, it's me, Mike.

1249
02:29:32,806 --> 02:29:37,310
Michael?

1250
02:29:37,352 --> 02:29:40,564
- Hey!
- Hey!

1251
02:29:40,605 --> 02:29:42,524
Hey!

1252
02:29:42,566 --> 02:29:45,110
How's things?

1253
02:29:45,151 --> 02:29:48,947
I'm okay. Never mind me.
How are you?

1254
02:29:48,989 --> 02:29:53,618
Great.

1255
02:29:53,660 --> 02:29:55,954

Take that too.
Tell him. Go ahead.

1413
02:46:55,807 --> 02:46:57,851
Et avec ca, ca suffit?

1414
02:47:47,067 --> 02:47:50,779
We don't have much time.
We don't have much time, Nick.

1415
02:48:17,472 --> 02:48:19,391
Don't do it.

1416
02:48:33,113 --> 02:48:34,990
What are you-

1417
02:48:58,388 --> 02:49:03,727
Is this what you want?

1418
02:49:13,612 --> 02:49:16,114
I love you, Nick.

1419
02:49:29,336 --> 02:49:31,212
Don't do it.

1420
02:49:50,523 --> 02:49:53,610
Come on, Nicky.
Come home.

1421
02:49:53,652 --> 02:49:55,820
Just come home. Home.

1422
02:49:58,740 --> 02:50:00,909
Talk to me.

1423
02:50:00,909 --> 02:50:04,913
Nicolas, talk to me.

1424
02:50:08,208 --> 02:50:10,794
Nicky. Nicky.

1425
02:50:10,835 --> 02:50:14,589
Wait a minute, Nick.
What did you do to your arms?

1426
02:50:14,631 --> 02:50:18,635
Nicky, do you remember
all the different ways of the trees?

1427
02:50:18,677 --> 02:50:21,680
Do you remember? Huh?

1428
02:50:21,721 --> 02:50:24,516
- The mountains? You remember all that?
- Yeah.

1429
02:50:24,558 --> 02:50:28,144
- One shot.
- One shot. One shot.

1430
02:50:30,814 --> 02:50:32,941
- Hey.
- Yeah.

1431
02:50:37,445 --> 02:50:40,865
Nicky! Nick! Nick!

1432
02:50:40,907 --> 02:50:44,494
Oh! Nicky! Nick!

1433
02:50:44,494 --> 02:50:47,289
Nicky! Nick!

1434
02:50:47,330 --> 02:50:50,333
Nicky! Nicky!

1435
02:50:50,375 --> 02:50:53,295
Don't! Nick! No!

1436
02:50:53,336 --> 02:50:57,132
No! No!
Nicky, you can't!

1437
02:51:07,934 --> 02:51:09,895
This seems to be
the last chapter...

1438
02:51:09,936 --> 02:51:12,814
in the history of American involvement
in Vietnam.

1439
02:51:12,856 --> 02:51:15,567
It's also been the largest
single movement of people...

1440
02:51:15,567 --> 02:51:18,361
in the history
of America itself.

1441
02:51:18,403 --> 02:51:20,697
Hillary Brown, ABC News,

1442
02:51:20,739 --> 02:51:23,658
aboard the attack aircraft carrier
USS Hancock,

1443
02:51:23,700 --> 02:51:26,536
in the South China Sea.

1444
02:52:44,781 --> 02:52:49,578
"May his soul dwell"

1445
02:52:49,619 --> 02:52:55,500
"Among the"

1446
02:52:55,542 --> 02:53:01,381
"Righteous"

1447
02:53:01,423 --> 02:53:04,467
Mommy!

1448
02:53:57,312 --> 02:53:59,314
I'll get these tables.

1449
02:54:07,280 --> 02:54:09,282
Axel, bring those two tables over here.

1450
02:54:09,324 --> 02:54:11,660
I- I'll get it.

1451
02:54:11,701 --> 02:54:15,497
Everybody make yourself at home.
The coffee's already made.

1452
02:55:07,924 --> 02:55:10,927
- Cups. I'll get the cups.
- I'll help you with that.

1453
02:55:10,969 --> 02:55:13,430
I'll help you too, John.

1454
02:55:32,532 --> 02:55:36,077
Oh, hey, there's too many cups.

1455
02:55:36,119 --> 02:55:38,121
How does everybody
want their eggs?

1456
02:55:38,163 --> 02:55:40,832
How about just scrambled, John?

1457
02:55:42,042 --> 02:55:43,919
Toast! Toast.

1458
02:56:03,230 --> 02:56:05,148
- Hey.
- Uh-uh.

1459
02:56:14,324 --> 02:56:16,826
Careful, Linda.
It's hot.

1460
02:56:18,954 --> 02:56:22,040
Hey, Axel, how about some beer?

1461
02:56:26,419 --> 02:56:29,214
Here, uh-
I'll get started on the eggs.

1462
02:56:29,256 --> 02:56:31,258
- Yeah, I'll help you with the eggs.
- No, Linda, Linda.

1463
02:56:31,258 --> 02:56:35,220
Sit down. Sit down.
Pour the coffee.

1464
02:57:07,961 --> 02:57:10,547
It's been such a gray day.

1465
02:57:51,963 --> 02:57:54,925
"Stand beside her"

1466
02:57:54,966 --> 02:57:57,886
"And guide her"

1467
02:58:27,165 --> 02:58:32,087
"God bless America"

1468
02:58:32,128 --> 02:58:36,091
"Land that I love"

1469
02:58:36,132 --> 02:58:39,135
"Stand beside her"

1470
02:58:39,177 --> 02:58:41,680
"And guide her"

1471
02:58:41,721 --> 02:58:44,140
"Through the night"

1472
02:58:44,182 --> 02:58:48,186
"With the light from above"

1473
02:58:48,395 --> 02:58:51,398
"From the mountains"

1474
02:58:51,398 --> 02:58:54,317
"To the prairies"

1475
02:58:54,317 --> 02:58:57,320
"To the oceans"

1476
02:58:57,362 --> 02:59:01,116
"White with foam"

1477
02:59:01,157 --> 02:59:06,371
"God bless America"

1478
02:59:06,413 --> 02:59:11,334
"My home sweet home"

1479
02:59:11,376 --> 02:59:17,132
"God bless America"

1480
02:59:17,173 --> 02:59:22,888
"My home sweet home"

1481
02:59:32,314 --> 02:59:36,192
- Here's to Nick.
- To Nick.

1482
02:59:36,234 --> 02:59:40,697
To Nick.
