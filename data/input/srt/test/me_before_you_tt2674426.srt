So.

00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,490
But you don't run with him?

483
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,722
I'm not exactly built for it.

484
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,803
This is an impressive list of hobbies.

485
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,167
Well, no, no. Okay, I read a bit.

486
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,288
(STAMMERS) And I like clothes.

487
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,169
You like clothes?

488
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,890
I don't do much, okay?

489
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,281
I go to work and I go home, and that's it.

490
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,601
Wow.

491
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,926
Your life's even duller than mine.

492
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,289
He's in a good mood.

493
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,683
He told me all about you offering him
the pasta with green gravy. (LAUGHS)

494
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,162
I've... (LAUGHS) I've never
had pesto sauce before.

495
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,891
No, whatever. It's all good.

496
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,249
It's a long time since
he's laughed at anything.

497
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,207
Hey.

498
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,281
NURSE: Hello there, Mr. Traynor.

499
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,646
How are you doing today?

500
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,040
Nathan, what are they doing in there?

501
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,688
He has a checkup every six months.

502
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,410
To see if he's getting better?

503
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,763
No, it's a spinal-cord injury.

504
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,730
He's not... He's not going to get better.

505
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,531
But you do all those exercises with him.

506
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,922
Yeah. That's to stop
his muscles atrophying.

507
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,241
Will's body no longer works below here.

508
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,562
Yeah, but he's still trying, right?

509
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,447
He threw everything
into physio the first year,

510
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,286
and all he got from it was
slight movement in his thumb and finger.

511
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,922
Then the first bout of pneumonia hit,
then autonomic dysreflexia...

512
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,570
(STAMMERS) What does that mean?

513
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,364
Right. So his blood pressure

514
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,521
- goes up and down.
- Yeah.

515
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,245
He's constantly open to infection.

516
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,722
But there's medical advances
taking place all the time. Right?

517
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,723
Well, yeah.

518
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,406
But no one's worked out
how to fix a spinal cord yet.

519
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,963
Oh, I hear this one's good.

520
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,247
Oh, because we suddenly speak Spanish?

521
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,401
No, it's got subtitles.

522
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,722
It gets so you don't notice after a while.

Oh.

525
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,041
Is he okay?

526
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,607
He's not great. Bit of a chill.

527
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,886
Where's Nathan?

528
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,605
I've called him. He'll be here soon.

529
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,330
Look, Camilla's had to go up to London.

530

Are you going to be all right?

531
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,846
- Of course.
- Yeah?

Yeah.

534
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,846
Okay.

535
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,844
Will, can I do anything?

536
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,325
My pillows aren't right.

00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,320
Um, what do I do?

538
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,168
Put your hand under my head,
on my neck, and just lift gently.

539
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,600
Okay.

540
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,728
- Oh, Jesus.

How's things?

567
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,168
Not great. He's in and out
and he's not drunk anything.

568
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,321
How long's he been like this?

569
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,686
Maybe four or five hours.

570
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,365
I tried to call.
I did give him painkillers.

571
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,681
Might as well have given him M&Ms.

572
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,370
Well, he said he just wanted to sleep.

573

Yeah, it's in the folder, Lou.

If he gets even a slight chill,
his temperature goes haywire.

00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,090
- Yeah, but he said...
- Just go and get us a fan

577
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,811
- and a damp towel, real quick.
- Okay.

watch what I'm doing.

- That's right.

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,847
About what?

644
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,206
Anything.

645
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,161
Well...

646
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,646
When I was little,

647
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,122
my mum got me a pair of glittery wellies,

648
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,931
and I refused to take them off.

649
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,404
I wore them in bed, in the bath,
all summer long.

650
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,006
My favorite outfit

651
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,811
was the glittery boots
and my bumblebee tights.

652
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,246
Bumblebee tights?

653
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,482
- Black and yellow stripes.
- Oh, dear God.

654
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,849
I just... I really, really, really
liked having stripy legs.

655
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,010
So what happened to these gorgeous wellies
and stripy tights?

656
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,924
Ah! I outgrew them.

657
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,366
It broke my heart.

658
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,726
And they don't make those tights anymore.

659
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,365
Not for grown women, anyway.

660
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,681
Strange, that.

661
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,611
Oh, you can mock. Didn't you
ever love anything that much?

662
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,245
Yes.

663
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,725
Yes, I did.

664
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,920
WILL: Interesting choice of footwear.

665
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,650
Patrick says they make me look
like a leprechaun drag queen.

666
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,961
He was being nice.

667
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,171
- Don't smile at me like that.
- Why not?

668
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,010
Because I don't know what it means.

669
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,482
Where did you pick up your exotic tastes?

670
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,563
- What do you mean by that?
- It can't be from around here.

671
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,721
Why not?

672
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,041
Because this is the kind of
place people come to

673
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,447
when they've got tired of actually living.

674
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,409
People here think excitement is a new

675
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,642
"Please be quiet" sign
going up in the library.

676

(LAUGHING)

677
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,531
You should be out there,
claiming the world as your own.

678
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,682
Showing your leprechaun shoes
to dodgy men.

679
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,201
- I like my life.
- You like everything.

680
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,089
- I'm happy here.
- Well, you shouldn't be.

681
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,766
Oh, you want me to be more
like the girls you know, do you?

682
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,730
Go to London, marry somebody like Rupert.

683
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,166
I believe he's taken.

684
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,526
And ignore the fact that he's shagging
his secretary within five years.

685
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,125
And bitch about him at dinner parties,

686
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,487
knowing he won't leave because
he's scared of the alimony.

687
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,563
And have sex once every six weeks,

688
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,883
and listen to him going on and on about
how much he adores the children,

689
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,441
while doing nothing
to actually take care of them.

690
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,850
And have perfect hair,
but get this kind of pinched face

691
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,162
through never saying
what you actually mean.

692
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,802
And develop an insane Pilates habit,
and buy a dog, or a horse,

693
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,570
and develop a crush
on your riding instructor.

694
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,041
And watch your husband take up jogging
when he hits 40 and buy a Harley.

695
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,010
And know that every day,
he goes into the office

696
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,245
and looks at the young men,
and feels like, somehow, he got suckered!

697
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,530
And leave him anyway, and come back here
to give the children a happy childhood.

698
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,881
Whoa!

699
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,890
There were a lot of divorce
handovers at the café.

700

Sorry.

701

How did you end up in that café?

702

Treena made a bet
that I couldn't get a job in 24 hours.

703
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,483
I proved her wrong.

704
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,369
And stayed there six years. Way to go!

705
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,965
I was supposed to leave.

706
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,128
I had a place at Manchester.

707

708

Mmm. So, why didn't you go?

710
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,331
You know what I see when I look at you?

711

- Don't say "potential."
- Potential.

712

You need to widen your horizons, Clark.

713

You only get one life.

714

It's actually your duty
to live it as fully as possible.

715
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,766
Well, you need a shave!

716
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,571
If that beard gets any longer,
I'll be picking food out of it.

717

And then I'll have to sue you
for undue distress in the workplace.

We made an agreement with Will.

737
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,811
Six months.

738
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,800
No. I only agreed so that we
had six months to change his mind.

to help our son end his life!

risk him trying again, alone.

- Yes, he's my son, too!

You know how much pain he's in.

He gave me six months.

748

01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,161
What? How many of those did you drink?

1280
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:34,369
Come on, let's give these tossers
something to talk about.

1281
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:35,851
- All right.
- Whoo.

1282

- (BOTH LAUGHING)

- He's ruining everything.
- And her.

1284
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,045
WILL: Are they all appalled?

1285
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,531
(LAUGHS) Yes.

1286
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,006
Yeah.

1287
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,961
Move closer. You smell fantastic.

1288
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:55,681
You never would've let those breasts
so near to me if I wasn't in a wheelchair.

1289
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:56,841
Oh, yeah?

1290
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,843
Well, you never would've been
looking at these breasts

1291
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,365
if you hadn't been in a wheelchair.

1292
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:01,521
What? Of course, I would.

1293
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,045
No, you wouldn't.

1294
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,362
You would've been too busy
looking at the leggy blondes.

1295
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,683
The ones who can smell
an expense account at 40 paces.

1296
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,531
And, anyway, I would've been
over there serving the drinks.

One of the invisibles.

1298
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,771

01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:17,207
- Yes, but in my defense...

Yep.

1302
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,487
Do you know something, Clark?

1303
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:28,170
You are pretty much the only thing that
makes me want to get up in the morning.

1304
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,202
Then let's go somewhere.

1305
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,051
Anywhere in the world. Just you and me.

1306

- Okay.
- (CHUCKLES) Yeah?

All the way to the hotel.

This is going to go very wrong.
You know that?

No, this is going to be brilliant!

any of my calls?

1318
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,250
I was worried sick.

Are you all right?

1320

I think I'm old enough to spend a night in
a hotel without permission, Mother, okay?

1321
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:20,286
Okay.

Right.

I'm guessing she didn't do your tubes.

1324

She did manage to get the
porter to help me into bed.

This is not good, mate. You're sweating.

Look at me. How's your eyesight?

I'm pretty sure you're Nathan. Am I right?

Yeah, I'm pretty sure you've
been on the drink. Am I right?

But there have been times when I've
stayed over, and I hear him screaming.

doing something worthwhile.

01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:02,241
Who says you failed?

1599
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:09,969
(SIGHS) I'm not sure anyone in the world

1600
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:14,445
could ever persuade that man,
once he'd set his mind to something.

1601
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:17,921
You can't change who people are.

1602
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:20,124
Then what can you do?

1603
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:21,611
You love them.

1604
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:22,801
(SOBS)

1605
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,611
No one could have done more than you.

1606
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:30,245
You have a heart as big as that castle,
and I love you for it.

1607
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:34,048
Have you seen them? Mr. Traynor?

1608
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:37,686
They left. This morning.

1609
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:42,766
Dad, have I made a huge mistake?

1610
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:50,691
Call them.

1611
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,323
You still have time.

1612
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:01,967
TREENA: Don't worry. Mum will come round.

1613
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:03,884
I'll talk to her.

1614
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:05,610
You're doing the right thing, Lou.

1615
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,050
You have to go.

1616
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,326
You were useless until you met him.

1617
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,001
Hello.

1618
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,001
Hello.

1619
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:56,685
He's just through there.

1620
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:57,841
Okay.

1621
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,126
Here.

1622
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:01,123
Oh, thank you. Thanks.

1623
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:09,805
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

1624
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:13,566
- (OBJECTS CLATTER)
- Oh!

1625
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,211
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

1626
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:19,807
The familiar sound of Louisa Clark
making an entrance.

1627
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,001
(CAMILLA CHUCKLES)

1628
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:23,089
We'll leave you be.

1629
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:30,526
Thank you.

1630
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:41,730
Don't tell me.

1631
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:44,087
You're here to make my last cup of tea.

1632
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:45,401
(CHUCKLES)

1633
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:47,250
Actually, no.

1634
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,368
I'm here to kidnap you.

1635
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:52,091
I'm gonna steal you and
I'm gonna take you to...

1636
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:53,401
WILL: Where?

1637
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:54,846
- LOU: Rio.
- WILL: Mmm.

1638
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,207
LOU: Or my mum and dad's.
I haven't quite decided yet.

1639
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:05,765
Open the doors, Clark.

1640
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:28,046
Come here.

1641
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:39,291
Closer.

1642
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,485
Look at me.

1643
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:59,282
Please, look at me.

1644
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,401
I can't.

1645
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:02,721
Tough.

1646
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,848
I need to see that face.

1647
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:08,481
I need to see that face of yours.

1648
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:12,450
Even if it is all pink and blotchy.

1649
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:14,201
(LAUGHS)

1650
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,083
You really are the most
impossible man, Will Traynor.

1651
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:22,323
And the world will definitely
be a better place without me.

1652
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:23,686
No.

1653
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:26,046
No, it won't.

1654
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:36,762
(SOFTLY) Don't be sad, Clark.

1655
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,287
Tell me something good.

1656
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:49,364
(SINGING MOLAHONKEY SONG)

1657
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:11,442
Will you stay?

1658
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:15,731
For as long as you want me to.

1659
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:07,281
Can you call my parents in?

1660
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:02,160
WILL: Clark.

1661
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:05,969
A few weeks should have passed
by the time you read this.

1662
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:09,090
If you followed the instructions,
you'll be in Paris

1663
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:12,483
on one of those chairs that never sit
quite level on the pavement.

1664
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:14,762
I hope it's still sunny.

1665
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:20,810
Across the bridge to your right
you will see L'Artisan Parfumeur.

1666
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,611
You should try the scent
called Papillons Extrême.

1667
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:26,161
I always did think
it would smell great on you.

1668
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:27,851
(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

1669
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:34,528
There are a few things
I wanted to say and couldn't,

1670
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:38,685
because you would have got all emotional
and you wouldn't have let me finish.

1671
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:43,286
So, here it is.

1672
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:47,521
When you get back home, Michael Lawler
will give you access to a bank account

1673
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:50,160
that contains enough
to give you a new beginning.

1674
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:52,129
Don't start panicking.

1675
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:54,886
It's not enough for you to sit around
for the rest of your life,

1676
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,566
but it should buy you your freedom.

1677
01:44:57,720 --> 01:45:00,564
At least from that little town
we both call home.

1678
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:04,162
Live boldly, Clark.

1679
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:05,566
Push yourself.

1680
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:07,165
Don't settle.

1681
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:10,880
Wear those stripy legs with pride.

1682
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:14,249
Knowing you still have
possibilities is a luxury.

1683
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:19,088
Knowing I might have given them to you
has eased something for me.

1684
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:22,686
So, this is it.

1685
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:26,849
You are scored on my heart, Clark.

1686
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,002
You were from the first day you walked in

1687
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:31,766
with your sweet smile
and your ridiculous clothes.

1688
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:33,570
And your bad jokes

1689
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:37,481
and your complete inability to ever hide
a single thing you felt.

1690
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:40,922
Don't think of me too often.

1691
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,489
I don't want you getting sad.

1692
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:45,244
Just live well.

1693
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:48,010
Just live.

1694
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:52,443
I'll be walking beside you
every step of the way.

1695
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:55,204
Love, Will.
