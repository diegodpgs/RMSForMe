1
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,883
- Victor, I don't know that it's...
- Mom, you have to wear the glasses.

2
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,123
- It's 3D, honey.
- Yes, of course.

3
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,447
So that's where my candlestick went.

4
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,682
Isn't that your
grandmother's tablecloth?

5
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,841
Yeah.

6
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,290
That looks great.

7
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,400
Whoa! I just felt like I was attacked!

8
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,683
Send in the marines!

9
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,602
Over here, men! This way!

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,445
- Whoa!
- Watch out!

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,606
- Sparky!
- Sparky, that's you!

12
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,643
You tell them, Sparky.

13
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,925
Oh, my!

14
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,880
Bravo!

15
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,207
Maybe just unplug it.

16
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,644
Well, it certainly was exciting.

17
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,927
Yeah, it was a big finish.
Well done, son.

18
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,043
I can fix this. Come on, boy.

19
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,123
All that time he spends up there.

20
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,646
A boy his age
needs to be outside with his friends.

21
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,167
I don't know that Victor has friends,
dear. Other than Sparky.

22
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,681
That's my point.

23
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,764
I don't want him to turn out,
you know, weird.

24
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,249
There's nothing wrong with Victor.
He's just in his own world.

25
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,211
Easy, boy.

26
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,723
See you later, sweetie.

27
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,410
Have a good day.

28
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,562
Victor! Come on, honey.
You're going to be late.

29
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,165
Go put Sparky in the back yard.

30
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,284
Come on, Sparky!

31
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,843
Good morning, Mr. Burgemeister.

32
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,208
Your dog has been
sniffing around my Dutch Dazzlers.

33
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,923
The other day
I caught him peeing on my flamingo.

34
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,521
I'll keep an eye on him.

35
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,761
You better.

36
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,521
Yes, sir.

37
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,283
Go on, Sparky. That's right!

38
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,966
Good boy. See you later!

39
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,010
Where do you think you're going?

40
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,681
School.

41
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,128
What about that dog of yours?

42
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,170
She's not in the house
and she's away from your tulips.

43
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,648
I want you to remember something.

44
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,566
While your parents are away,
I am in charge here.

45
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,331
Yes, Uncle Bob.

46
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,808
Dutch Day is coming up,
and I don't need any trouble.

47
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,486
- How's your song coming?
- Okay.

48
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,291
Keep at it!

49
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,603
Dutch Day is a big day for me.

50
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,966
Yes, sir.

51
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,249
Good morning, children.

52
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,324
I am Mr. Rzykruski.

53
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,568
I will be your new science teacher.

54
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,250
Apparently, Mr. Holcomb
had an incident.

55
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,448
He got hit by lightning!

56
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,688
Well, that is bad.

57
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,162
But he did not get "hit" by lightning.

58
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,565
Lightning does not hit a person the way
one is hit by a baseball or a cabbage.

59
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,644
Lightning is simply electricity.

60
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,607
The cloud is angry. Yes. Making storm.

61
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,482
All the electrons are saying,
"I am leaving you!

62
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,684
"I go to the land of opportunity!"

63
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,886
The ground says,

64
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,488
"Yes, we need electrons
trained in science just like you!

65
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,490
"Come. Come! Welcome."

66
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,891
So both sides start to build a ladder.

67
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,842
This man, he comes out
to look at the storm.

68
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,521
He does not see the invisible ladders.

69
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,331
When the two ladders meet... Boom!

70
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,769
The circuit is complete

71
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,561
and all of the electrons rush
to the land of opportunity.

72
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,121
This man is in the way!

73
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,165
But it is very rare
to have such an incident.

74
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,604
But it's not rare.

75
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,082
Lightning happens
to people all the time here.

76
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,766
There's a thunderstorm
almost every night.

77
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,490
My dad got hit twice.

78
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,323
They built New Holland
on an abandoned gold mine.

79
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,289
I heard it was a cemetery.

80
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,524
That's where they buried the miners.

81
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,166
It's the windmill that does it.

82
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:27,171
Turning, turning the air until
the sky itself rages against the night.

83
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,970
No. Cemetery. Definitely.

84
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,928
Students, on your way out, take
a permission slip for the science fair.

85
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,602
First prize is a huge trophy!

86
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,645
Hello, Victor.

87
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,481
Hi.

88
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,565
Mr. Whiskers had
a dream about you last night.

89
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,286
How do you know?

90
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,644
Because this morning he made this.

91
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,926
Did you get that out of the litter box?

92
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,448
It's an omen.

93
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,004
Last month he dreamed about Bob.

94
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,809
He fell in a manhole.

95
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,968
He dreamed about Toshiaki

96
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,002
the day he pitched a perfect game.

97
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,368
And Nassor the day
he got knocked unconscious.

98
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,526
If Mr. Whiskers dreams about you,

99
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,163
it means something big
is going to happen.

100
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,764
You can keep it.

101
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,883
One day you'll dream about me,
won't you, Kitty?

102
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,882
Hey, boy. How are you doing?

103
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,202
You'll be my partner, right, Victor?

104
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,487
Because you have to have a partner
for the science fair,

105
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,847
and whoever is your
partner is going to win.

106
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,481
You know the most about science
so pick me as a partner.

107
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,642
I have lots of ideas!

108
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,049
We can make a death ray!

109
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,049
It says no death rays. See?

110
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,080
Oh, man.

111
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,528
I still want to do it. Come on.

112
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,365
Who else would be your partner?

113
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,967
You don't have friends and neither do I.

114
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,003
I'm sorry, Edgar.
I just don't need a partner.

115
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,244
I like to work alone.

116
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,324
- Will you sign my permission slip?
- Dinner's ready.

117
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,284
Victor, have I ever talked to you
about what I do for a living?

118
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,681
You're a travel agent?

119
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,530
I sell dreams.

120
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,048
I tell people, "You can sail to Italy.

121
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,123
"You can do the hula in Hawaii."

122
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,611
- Will you sign my form?
- I'm getting to that.

123
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,281
Okay.

124
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,442
In my job, sometimes you have people

125
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,046
who don't want quite
the same thing, right?

126
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,126
Say a husband wants to
play golf in Scotland

127
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,568
but the wife wants to
paddle down the Amazon.

128
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,122
All right, you've got two
conflicting ideas here.

129
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,490
And it's my job, Victor,
to help them meet halfway.

130
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,644
Say... Scottsdale, Arizona.

131
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,280
He gets to golf, she gets Indians.

132
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,886
But there's no river. And no jungle.

133
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,611
- Nobody gets what they want.
- Exactly.

134
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,881
And wrong.

135
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,971
They both get what they want
because they compromise.

136
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,006
You'd like to do the science fair
and that's great.

137
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,210
I'd like you to try a sport.
Say, I don't know, baseball.

138
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,886
Science fair, baseball.
Science fair, baseball.

139
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,764
How do you choose?
Guess what? You don't have to.

140
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,763
No reason you can't do both.

141
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,446
You meet in the middle.
Everyone's happy.

142
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,685
Look at what Toshiaki's doing.

143
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,243
He's keeping his eye on the target,
never losing his concentration.

144
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,728
Strike three! Next batter!

145
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,202
I want you to concentrate
on your project for the science fair.

146
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,520
Come on, honey!

147
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,684
Whoa. Nice catch, Sparky.

148
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,966
Come on, Victor, please.

149
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,327
Tie Sparky up and get
your head into the game.

150
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,606
Time out!

151
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,481
Sorry, boy.

152
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,525
Hey, Sparky.

153
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,400
Play ball!

154
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,171
Strike one!

155
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,486
Nice try, son.

156
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,371
When conducting an experiment,
trying is the important thing.

157
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,247
It is okay to fail
as long as you keep trying!

158
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,807
Come on, Victor. You can do it, honey.

159
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,487
Strike two!

160
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,561
Yes!

161
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,405
Come on, honey!

162
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,006
Victor, run!

163
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,321
Sparky!

164
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,606
Sparky!

165
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,446
No!

166
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,811
He was a great dog. A great friend.

167
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,248
The best dog a kid could have.

168
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,849
When you lose someone you love,
they never really leave you.

169
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,050
They just move into
a special place in your heart.

170
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,088
He'll always be there, Victor.

171
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,840
I don't want him in my heart.
I want him here with me.

172
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,886
I know.

173
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,200
If we could bring him back, we would.

174
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,681
Try and get some sleep, sweetheart.
Things will seem better in the morning.

175
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,451
Just like lightning,
the nervous system is electricity.

176
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,884
We are wires and springs and cables
to send the messages.

177
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,767
Even after death, the wiring remains.

178
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,087
Watch as the muscles
respond to the electricity.

179
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,401
Hi, Victor! How was school?

180
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,241
Okay.

181
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,484
I'm sorry, boy.

182
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,885
You're alive!

183
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,566
You're alive!

184
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,646
Sparky!

185
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,085
You're alive!

186
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,401
I can't believe it! You're alive!

187
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,405
I can fix that.

188
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,486
It worked.

189
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,766
It really worked.

190
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,046
Victor!

191
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,250
Victor, breakfast!

192
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,480
Victor?

193
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,325
Are you up here?

194
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,966
Quiet down, boy.

195
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,041
Victor?

196
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,725
Sparky...

197
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,441
Quiet.

198
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,921
Victor!

199
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,883
French toast or waffles?

200
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,681
Waffles.

201
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,047
Then I'll need my waffle iron back,
Mr. Director.

202
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,690
It's my science project. It's a robot.

203
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,966
- A robotic bucket?
- Yes.

204
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,006
- For mopping, I suppose?
- Yes.

205
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,211
Maybe when you're finished,
you'll let me use it.

206
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,168
Sorry, boy, but I can't let
anyone know about you.

207
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,085
They may not understand.

208
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,322
So, you need to stay here today.

209
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,450
No, couldn't be.

210
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,681
What?

211
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,483
I know. And Helen said
she thought they were

212
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,928
putting up some
kind of TV antenna on top of the roof.

213
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,971
In the middle of a thunderstorm?

214
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,246
That's what she said.

215
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,851
I don't believe it.

216
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,564
And did you get
that big power surge the other night?

217
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,688
Jack thought it was a fuse box,

218
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,650
but apparently it affected
the whole neighborhood.

219
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,088
Sometimes I wonder
just what goes on in that house.

220
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,208
I just don't feel safe walking by there.

221
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,643
Sweetie, you okay? Here you go.

222
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,282
So anyway, Jack loves it here,

223
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,771
but if the schools weren't so great,

224
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,650
sometimes I wonder
if we'd be better off closer to my mother.

225
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,604
Sparky?

226
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,084
- Hi, Victor. How was school?
- Good. Got to go.

227
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,840
Sparky?

228
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,761
Sparky?

229
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,601
There you are.

230
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,563
Good boy. Sorry you had
to stay here alone all day.

231
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,441
What's the matter, boy? Are you okay?

232
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,445
You're a little low.

233
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,087
Are you hungry, boy?

234
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,364
All right, here. Let's top you up.

235
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,891
Victor?
Could you come down here, please?

236
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,086
Victor!

237
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,165
Your friend is here.

238
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,561
Edgar?

239
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,641
Hey-

240
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,531
Edgar, what are you doing here?

241
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,807
- I know.
- What?

242
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,606
I know.

243
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,369
- Know what?
- You know.

244
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,841
No.

245
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,526
I think I know what you know I know.

246
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,966
Look, I don't know what you think
I know, but I don't know it.

247
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,088
Your dog is alive!

248
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,927
- That's impossible.
- I know.

249
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,607
I know it is so impossible, but you did it.

250
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,444
YOU did it!

251
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,843
So, show me how, or I'll tell everyone.

252
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,046
Mrs. Frankenstein!

253
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,448
May I have a cookie, please?

254
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,211
Yes, of course.

255
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,725
All right, come on.

256
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,044
I think the wind and the lightning
are part of the same thing,

257
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,724
some kind of strange force.

258
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,122
But the wind isn't strong enough
to bring an animal back from the dead.

259
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,202
For that, you need lightning.

260
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,604
So when can I do it?

261
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,202
You can't. This isn't an experiment.
It's my dog.

262
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,727
Show-and-tell, Victor.

263
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,643
You show me, and I won't tell.

264
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,170
Can I help you, young man?

265
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,242
I'd like to buy a fish.

266
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,970
Certainly. Which one?

267
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,371
This one.

268
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,931
What do we do now?

269
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,763
What happened to it? What did you do?

270
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,286
I don't know. It should have worked.

271
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,247
It's invisible. It's an invisible goldfish.

272
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,523
- Why is it invisible?
- I have no idea.

273
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,291
You can't tell anyone.
You understand that, right?

274
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,964
Not until we figure out how it works.

275
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,129
Okay, okay.

276
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,011
- Promise?
- Promise.

277
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,603
How are we supposed
to see an invisible goldfish?

278
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,843
Put your finger in. You can feel it.

279
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,880
It bit me!

280
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,851
Let me see it.

281
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,523
It's my science project,
and it's top secret!

282
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,248
Yeah? Well,
our science fair project is even cooler.

283
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,771
- What is it?
- Double top secret.

284
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,411
Sea-Monkeys?

285
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,650
We got to come up
with something better.

286
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,569
- Bigger.
- I know.

287
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,644
The science fair is in two days.

288
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,881
I know.

289
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,526
- You're the smart one!
- I know.

290
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,129
Okay, okay. Sit still.

291
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,206
Sparky, no! No!

292
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,201
Sorry, boy, but
we can't risk anyone seeing you again.

293
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,689
Toshiaki says you
have an invisible fish.

294
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,326
- No, he didn't.
- So, you don't?

295
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,687
I didn't say that. Who said I did?

296
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,965
Toshiaki says it's your
science fair project.

297
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,208
If it was, I couldn't tell you.

298
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,445
So it isn't,

299
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,405
or it is?

300
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,804
No. Yes.

301
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,525
I'm confused.

302
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,524
Do you have an invisible fish?

303
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,401
Okay.

304
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,642
But you have to keep it a secret.

305
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,164
Swish your finger around.
You can feel it.

306
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,487
It's just water. There's nothing there.

307
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,523
No, it's invisible.

308
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,041
Huh?

309
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,010
I don't know what kind
of game you and Victor are playing,

310
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,803
but that trophy will be mine.

311
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,201
Victor.

312
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,404
Something's wrong with my fish!

313
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,767
- What is it?
- It's not there anymore.

314
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,605
Maybe it just hopped out.
Did you have the lid on it?

315
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,361
Yes, ever since

316
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,568
I left your house.

317
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,564
I mean, it was there when I went to bed.

318
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,364
I'm thinking maybe they don't last.

319
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,207
They're only there for a little bit
and then they're gone.

320
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,205
No! Sparky!

321
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,201
Sparky!

322
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,569
Don't worry. I can fix that, too.

323
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,646
Good night, boy.

324
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,609
Are you sure this is going to work?

325
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,931
No. That's why it's called
an "experiment."

326
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,765
We have to collect data.

327
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,569
Do we have to collect it on me?

328
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,401
- Ready?
- No.

329
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,687
Ten, nine, eight...

330
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,000
We could use a test
dummy or something.

331
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,248
...seven, six, five...

332
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,367
Computer simulation.

333
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,841
...four, three, two...

334
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,241
- I have to pee!
-...one.

335
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,367
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

336
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,371
Whoa, whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

337
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,841
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

338
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,365
Whoa!

339
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,450
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

340
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,729
It's working! It's working!

341
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,481
What were you boys doing on the roof?

342
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,000
- Science.
- Science.

343
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,088
As mayor of New Holland,

344
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,049
you have entrusted me with your safety.

345
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:14,965
So I can't sit idly
while a teacher endangers our children.

346
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,608
The man is a menace!

347
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,528
She's right! He's crazy!

348
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,331
Have you looked through
this science book they're using?

349
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:27,167
Apparently Pluto isn't good
enough to be a planet anymore.

350
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,608
When I was a kid,
Pluto was a great planet.

351
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,682
This guy comes along
and rewrites the rules!

352
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,730
In fairness, he didn't write the textbook.

353
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,889
Mr. Mayor, Edward Frankenstein.

354
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,521
Your neighbor, of course.

355
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,806
I just would like to say
that our son Victor

356
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,963
is just crazy about the new teacher.

357
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,686
Thinks he's great.

358
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,764
My Cynthia has been asking

359
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,731
all sorts of strange questions
about things I've never even heard of.

360
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,689
Shouldn't we at least give the man
a chance to explain himself?

361
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,527
Yes.

362
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,605
Please come up, Mr. Menace.

363
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:29,011
Ladies, gentlemen.

364
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,891
I think the confusion here
is that you are all very ignorant.

365
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,244
Is that right word, "ignorant"?

366
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,964
I mean "stupid," "primitive,"
"unenlightened."

367
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,764
You do not understand science,
so you are afraid of it.

368
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,923
Like a dog is afraid
of thunder or balloons.

369
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:55,444
To you, science is magic and witchcraft
because you have such small minds.

370
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,447
I cannot make your heads bigger,

371
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:05,128
but your children's heads,
I can take them and crack them open.

372
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,289
This is what I try to do,
to get at their brains!

373
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,006
Oh, my.

374
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,921
Thank you.

375
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,765
Oh, jeez.

376
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,369
Be quick, boy.
They'll be home any minute.

377
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,211
Praise be New Holland

378
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,807
Praise be New Holland

379
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:39,051
Streets so wide and sidewalk

380
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,886
The sidewalks. Okay.

381
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,760
Praise be New Holland

382
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,171
No! No!

383
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,846
No,no,no!

384
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,091
Victor?

385
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,167
Victor?

386
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,925
Hi, Elsa. What are you doing?

387
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,208
Practicing my song for Dutch Day.

388
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,681
It's nice.

389
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,047
- Did you get a new dog?
- No.

390
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,050
- I heard a bark.
- Yeah, that was me.

391
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,170
You are barking?

392
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,922
You must really miss Sparky.

393
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,363
I got to go. Bye

394
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,727
Bye.

395
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,124
I feel so sad for him, Persephone.

396
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,168
He really misses his dog.

397
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,564
Where's Mr. Rzykruski?

398
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,689
All I know is I'll be teaching the class
for the rest of the semester.

399
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,002
Do you know anything about science?

400
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,731
I know more than you do.

401
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,490
Mr. Rzykruski knew a lot.

402
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,690
Well, sometimes knowing
too much is the problem.

403
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,125
What about the science fair?

404
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,921
It's still on, but it will be judged
by someone who's not insane!

405
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,001
Me!

406
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,447
Now get cracking,
and may the best person win!

407
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,241
I can't believe they let
the gym teacher be the judge.

408
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,082
She's not even interested in science.

409
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,450
Back home, everyone is scientist.

410
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,928
Even my plumber wins Nobel Prize.

411
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,970
Your country does not
make enough scientist.

412
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,889
Always needs more.

413
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,401
You should be a scientist, Victor.

414
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,170
Nobody likes scientists.

415
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:46,650
They like what science gives them,
but not the questions, no.

416
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,764
Not the questions that science asks.

417
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,360
Actually, I have a question.

418
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,361
That is why you are a scientist.

419
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:03,288
I was doing my experiment, my project,
and the first time it worked great,

420
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,244
but the next time it didn't.

421
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,931
I mean, it sort of worked,
but then it didn't.

422
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,491
And I don't know why.

423
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,287
Then maybe you never really
understood it the first time.

424
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:19,125
People think science is here,
but it is also here.

425
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,130
The first time, did you
love your experiment?

426
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,641
Yes.

427
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,484
And the second time?

428
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,211
No. I just wanted it over.

429
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,161
Then you changed the variables.

430
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,523
I was doing it for the wrong reason.

431
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,763
Science is not good or bad, Victor.

432
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,120
But it can be used both ways.

433
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,685
That is why you must always be careful.

434
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,881
I can't believe I broke
my arm for nothing.

435
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,881
None of us are going to win!
E has an invisible fish!

436
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,046
No, he doesn't.
You fell for a parlor trick.

437
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,365
You're saying he faked it?

438
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,163
That fish you showed us, was it real?

439
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,883
It was, and it was dead, too.

440
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,289
You brought an animal
back from the dead?

441
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,524
No, Victor did.

442
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,410
With lightning, and boom, and...

443
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,365
Impossible.

444
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,931
I swear! I mean,
he already brought back his dog.

445
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,445
He brought back Sparky?

446
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,448
Victor will win the science fair
unless we can do better.

447
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,241
Bigger.

448
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,849
You say you know Victor's secret?

449
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,207
Now is your chance to prove it.

450
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,320
Now, where's my muffin tin?

451
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,451
Victor.

452
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,690
Sparky?

453
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,602
Sparky! But you're...

454
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,805
Sparky's alive!

455
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,086
Sparky?

456
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,486
Hey, come on!

457
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,242
Mom? Dad? What's going on?

458
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,401
Sparky! No! Sparky!

459
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,326
Sparky, no!

460
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,970
Sparky, come back!

461
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,087
Sparky!

462
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,685
Hey, hey! Just a minute!

463
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,402
No! I have to go find Sparky!

464
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,882
Victor, what have you done?

465
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,530
You said yourself, if you could
bring back Sparky, you would!

466
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,885
Yes, but that was different
because we couldn't!

467
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,088
It's easy to promise the impossible.

468
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,970
What you did was a very serious thing.

469
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,248
Crossing the boundary
between life and death.

470
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,004
Reanimating a corpse!

471
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,890
It's very... Upsetting.

472
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,769
I just wanted my dog back.

473
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,161
Sweetheart.

474
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,084
We'll help you look for Sparky

475
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,642
but when we get back,
I think we need to have a little talk.

476
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,926
Understood?

477
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,881
Yes.

478
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,721
Now, let's go find your dog.

479
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,207
Sparky!

480
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,770
Sparky, are you in there?

481
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,606
Mom, Dad! I'm going
to check the school and the park.

482
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,047
You guys do the town square, okay?

483
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,360
Got it.

484
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,087
Sparky!

485
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:42,961
Cool.

486
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,044
Interesting.

487
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,967
It has something
to do with the lightning.

488
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,162
I don't really understand it.

489
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,410
But I do!

490
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:10,486
Tonight, we shall bring the dead to life!

491
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,202
Sparky! Where are you?

492
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,125
Sparky!

493
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,647
Sparky! Sparky!

494
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,560
Thank you. Thank you so much.

495
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,211
And now it's my pleasure

496
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,602
to introduce this year's Little Dutch Girl,

497
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,328
my niece, Elsa Van Helsing.

498
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,844
I don't think this is safe.

499
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:00,450
Nonsense! We have
the fire chief over here.

500
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,841
You know, a lot of girls
would kill to be in your place.

501
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,490
I'd welcome death.

502
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,921
Praise be New Holland

503
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,046
Streets so wide and sidewalks clean

504
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:25,045
Modest homes at modest prices

505
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,682
Evelyone's hope and dream

506
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,570
I'm going to win.

507
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,844
No, I shall win the science fair.

508
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:58,642
In our houses tight and safe

509
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,486
We have nothing to fear

510
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,527
The tomb of Colossus.

511
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,526
Soon you shall be awakened

512
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:20,241
and we shall be reunited once again!

513
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,405
Shelley.

514
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,408
Praise be New Holland

515
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:44,487
May your windmills spin forevermore

516
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,844
Isn't she adorable?

517
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,561
Mr. Whiskers?

518
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,445
Mr. Whiskers?

519
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,041
Hello!

520
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:38,961
Is someone there?

521
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,209
Rise, Colossus.

522
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,240
Rise from your tomb!

523
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,247
Shelley?

524
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:04,561
Shelley?

525
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,246
Sparky!

526
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,080
Sparky!

527
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,081
Sparky?

528
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,601
Sparky?

529
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:37,446
Sparky!

530
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,165
Sparky, it's okay, boy. It's just me.

531
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,205
I thought that you were gone.

532
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,530
I never want to lose you.

533
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:58,486
Promise you'll never go
running off, okay?

534
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,086
Come on, boy.

535
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,165
Was someone else here?

536
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,447
- Victor! I need your help.
- Did you see those things?

537
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,045
- They were like...
- Sea-Monkeys!

538
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,804
You know how on
the package, they're like,

539
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,121
in a happy kingdom
and everyone's smiling?

540
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,646
- Yeah?
- They're not like that at all.

541
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:02,690
- Victor! I need your help.
- I asked him first!

542
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,091
My problem bigger!

543
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,888
Yeah, he's right.

544
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,845
Okay, let's go!

545
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,122
And now for our next act,

546
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,449
we have something really big.

547
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,322
No! Get away!

548
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:53,002
Oh, no!

549
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,450
This way! In here!

550
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,650
Go, Colossus.

551
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,203
Kill! Kill!

552
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:44,926
Kill!

553
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,171
Colossus?

554
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,290
Get away from me!

555
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,924
Get away from me!

556
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,645
Your Sea-Monkeys.
Are they freshwater or saltwater?

557
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:37,051
Freshwater.

558
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,442
Freshwater animals can't tolerate salt.

559
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:49,930
Hey! Over here!

560
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:14,847
Cool.

561
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:21,801
Help!

562
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,121
Get back!

563
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,445
Stay away from us!

564
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:47,400
Sparky!

565
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:04,847
No,no,no,no!

566
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:08,681
Whoa, stop!
You put me down! I gave you life!

567
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:14,446
Victor! Victor, I need help. Please!

568
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:46,681
Shelley?

569
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,041
Persephone!

570
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,242
Persephone, are you okay?

571
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:57,047
Here, Mr. Whiskers.

572
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:00,489
Here, kitty, kitty, Mr. Whiskers.

573
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,087
No!

574
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,486
Persephone!

575
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,765
Bring her back!

576
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,123
Mr. Whiskers.

577
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,804
I'm coming, Elsa!

578
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:23,891
What happened?

579
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,811
Sparky! There you are.

580
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,241
Are you all right?

581
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,486
What you got there, boy?

582
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:33,641
Let me through!

583
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:37,887
I knew it. It's the boy's dead dog!

584
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:43,802
That's Elsa's wig. Where's my niece?

585
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,208
He's killed the little girl!

586
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,367
After him! Kill the monster!

587
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,161
Help!

588
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,926
Help!

589
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,291
Stay away from us!

590
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,246
Get him!

591
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:45,890
Where's my niece?

592
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,489
Look out! It's on fire!

593
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,851
There's Elsa!

594
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:58,761
Help!

595
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,521
Elsa!

596
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,645
Sparky!

597
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,441
Victor!

598
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,961
- Help!
- Hang on! Don't let go!

599
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,565
I can't reach!

600
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,446
Hang on!

601
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,290
I can't hold on much longer.

602
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:59,281
Sparky!

603
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,001
Victor!

604
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,730
Stay back. It's too dangerous.

605
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:12,961
That's my son in there!

606
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:47,691
Victor!

607
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,121
- Victor!
- Honey, are you all right?

608
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,806
Sparky!

609
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:41,684
No!

610
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:16,561
Victor,

611
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,768
is there anything we can do for you?

612
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:22,167
You said that I need to let him go.

613
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:26,727
Sometimes adults don't know
what they're talking about.

614
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:40,885
Start your engines!

615
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,603
Give it more juice!

616
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,484
Turn off your engines!

617
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:33,968
It's okay, boy.
You don't have to come back.

618
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:37,123
You'll always be in my heart.

619
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,691
Sparky!
