1
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,000
I wish you wouldn't do that around me.
lt's so filthy!

2
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,220
Don't give me a problem
about the cigarettes.

3
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,640
It's such a filthy habit.

4
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,220
Oh, my God!

5
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,850
Look at this.

6
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,400
Oh, Jesus. Oh, this is so appalling.

7
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,530
Oh, I can't believe it.

8
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,070
I can't believe they gave it to him.

9
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,250
Ah, this is pathetic.

10
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,540
Now he's a loser with a Jaguar.

11
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,586
Seriously, who did he have to blow
to get that thing?

12
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,673
Good morning, sir.
-Mr. Willis.

13
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,091
It's really a...

14
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,509
Mr. Trask!

15
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,511
Quite a piece of machinery.

16
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:43,097
-Good morning, Havemeyer.
-Morning to you, sir.

17
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,348
Bene!

18
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,392
-Bene?
-Bene! Fabulous!

19
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,768
What's fabulous?

20
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,062
That fine piece of steel you have back there.

21
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,231
Ah, you don't think I deserve it.

22
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,483
No, sir. On the contrary.

23
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,527
I think it's great.

24
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:59,238
Why should the headmaster of Baird
be seen putt-putting

25
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:01,073
around in some junker?

26
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,618
In fact, I think
the board of trustees have had

27
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,996
their first true stroke
of inspiration in some time.

28
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,498
Well, thank you, Havemeyer.

29
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,667
I'll take that at face value.

30
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,836
I'd expect nothing less, sir.

31
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,255
Have a good day.

32
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,468
-Morning, Mrs. Hunsaker.
-Good morning.

33
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,220
What have we here, Murderer's Row?

34
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,103
What was that about?

35
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,647
Nothing. Just saying hello.

36
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,941
I like to say hello to Headmaster Trask.

37
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,986
Sugarbush. Lift tickets and condo vouchers.

38
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,863
I thought we were going to Stowe.

39
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,907
Sugarbush is Stowe, Jimmy.

40
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,659
This year we're doing it right.

41
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,495
Thanksgiving in Vermont,
Christmas in Switzerland...

42
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,747
-Christmas in Gstaad is gonna cost us...
-"Staad."

43
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,123
The "G" is silent.

44
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,708
"Staad." George?

45
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,293
-"Staad."
-Trent?

46
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,629
-"Staad," man.
-So what about Staad?

47
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,464
Fine. The "G" may be silent,

48
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,217
but it's gonna take at least
three grand to get there.

49
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,927
I'll have to talk to my father.

50
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,680
Better yet, have my father talk to your father.

51
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,723
Or my father talk to your father.

52
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,186
You going home this weekend, Chas?

53
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,106
I don't know.

54
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,817
You going home to fuckin' Idaho
for Thanksgiving?

55
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,443
I'm from Oregon.

56
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,154
I meant fuckin' Oregon.

57
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,073
Charlie, how do you feel about skiing?

58
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,369
You in the mood for
the white-bosomed slopes of Vermont?

59
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,664
Got a deal going.

60
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,124
20% off for my friends.

61
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,667
My father set it up.

62
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,168
Christmas in Switzerland.

63
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,504
-Staad.
-Gstaad. Dropping the "G" is phony.

64
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,131
You said everybody says "Staad."

65
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,674
Not if you've been there.

66
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:45,011
Easter in Bermuda,
then Kentucky Derby weekend.

67
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,221
We could fit you in, kid.

68
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:51,183
Well, how much are
these white-bosomed slopes of Vermont?

69
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,185
1, 200.

70
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,440
Includes a nine-course,
champagne Thanksgiving dinner.

71
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:01,193
$1,200 is a little rich for my blood, Harry.

72
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,320
Well, how short are you?

73
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,489
How short, Harry?

74
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:09,201
So short it wouldn't be worth the trouble
of you and George to measure.

75
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,953
But thanks for askin', all right?

76
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,246
Mmm-hmm.

77
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,998
If you change your mind...

78
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,417
What'd you do that for?
You know he's on aid.

79
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,712
On major holidays, Willis,
it's customary for the lord of the manor

80
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,005
to offer drippings to the poor.

81
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,465
You're so full of shit!

82
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:50,826
Hi. Mrs. Rossi?

83
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,328
Yes?

84
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,330
I'm here about the weekend job.

85
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,167
Come on in.

86
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,800
Does he got pimples? He hates pimples.

87
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,426
Francine, be quiet.

88
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:10,096
Pimples. Pimples. Yeah.

89
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,597
Shush!

90
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,558
I'm sorry. The school gave me your name,
but I've forgotten it.

91
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,102
It's Charlie Simms.

92
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,145
-How are you, Charlie?
-Fine, thanks.

93
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,396
Right this way.

94
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,528
You're available the whole weekend?

95
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,821
Yeah.

96
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,781
-Not going home for Thanksgiving?
-No.

97
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,116
Good.

98
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,246
They put him in a veteran's home,
but he hated it,

99
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,456
so I told my dad that we'd take him.

100
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,837
Before you go in,
do you mind my telling you a few things?

101
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:46,882
Don't "sir" him
and don't ask him too many questions.

102
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:51,053
And if he staggers a little when he gets up,
don't pay any attention.

103
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:56,392
Charlie, I can tell
you're the right person for the job.

104
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,145
And Uncle Frank's gonna like you a lot, too.

105
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,691
Where you gonna be this weekend?

106
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,943
Oh, we're driving to Albany.

107
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,114
Donny, my husband, has family there.

108
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,163
Do you want Tommy in or out?

109
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,747
Leave him out!

110
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:22,459
He's chasing that Calico ginch
from the track houses again!

111
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,468
Down deep, the man is a lump of sugar.

112
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,115
Sir?

113
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,075
Don't call me sir.

114
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,660
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,370
I mean mister, sir.

116
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:02,541
Uh-oh, we got a moron here, is that it?

117
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,084
No, mister...

118
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,669
That is...

119
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,548
Lieutenant. Yes, sir...

120
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,550
Lieutenant Colonel.

121
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:15,804
Twenty-six years on the line,
nobody ever busted me four grades before.

122
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,390
Get in here, you idiot!

123
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:28,567
Come a little closer.
I wanna get a better look at you.

124
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,787
How's your skin, son?

125
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,081
My skin, sir?

126
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,791
Oh, for Christ's sake.

127
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,752
-I'm sorry, I don...
-Just call me Frank.

128
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,587
Call me Mr. Slade.

129
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:52,508
Call me Colonel, if you must.
Just don't call me sir.

130
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,678
All right, Colonel.

131
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,889
Simms, Charles.

132
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,266
A senior.

133
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,101
You on student aid, Simms?

134
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,852
Yes, I am.

135
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,272
For "student aid" read "crook."

136
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:10,943
Your father peddles car telephones
at a 300% markup.

137
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,779
Your mother works on heavy commission
in a camera store.

138
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,782
Graduated to it from espresso machines.

139
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:27,084
What are you,
dying of some wasting disease?

140
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,213
No, I'm right... I'm right here.

141
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:34,675
I know exactly where your body is.

142
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,012
What I'm lookin' for is
some indication of a brain.

143
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,557
Too much football without a helmet?

144
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,394
Hah! Lyndon's line on Gerry Ford.

145
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,482
Deputy Debriefer, Paris, Peace Talks, '68.

146
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:54,653
Snagged the Silver Star and a silver bar.
Threw me into G-2.

147
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:56,655
G-2?

148
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,908
Intelligence, of which you have none.

149
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,539
Where you from?

150
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,750
Gresham, Oregon,

151
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:10,919
Colonel.

152
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,589
What does your daddy do
in Gresham, Oregon?

153
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,008
Hmm? Count wood chips?

154
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:20,929
My stepfather and my mom
run a convenience store.

155
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,099
How convenient. What time they open?

156
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,018
5:00 a.m.

157
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,186
Close?

158
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,604
1:00 a.m.

159
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,522
Hard workers.

160
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,483
You got me all misty-eyed!

161
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,615
So, what are you doing here
in this sparrow-fart town?

162
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,868
I attend Baird.

163
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,829
Attend Baird!

164
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,875
I know you go to the Baird school.

165
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,878
Point is, how do you afford it,

166
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:57,674
even with the student aid
and the folks back home hustlin' corn nuts?

167
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,846
I won a Young American
merit scholarship.

168
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,348
Hoo-ah!

169
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:10,062
Glory, glory
Hallelujah

170
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:14,066
Glory, glory
Hallelujah

171
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,488
Who's there?

172
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,865
That little piece of tail?

173
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,912
Get her outta here!

174
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,964
Yeah.

175
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,759
Can't believe they're my blood.

176
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:50,060
IQ of sloths and the manners of banshees.

177
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,646
He's a mechanic, she's a homemaker.

178
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,107
He knows as much about cars
as a beauty queen,

179
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,277
and she bakes cookies, taste like wing nuts.

180
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,780
As for the tots, they're twits.

181
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,409
How's your skin, son?
I like my aides to be presentable.

182
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,164
Well, I...

183
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:11,957
I've had a few zits.

184
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,502
But my roommate, he lent me his Clinique

185
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,880
because he's from Chestnut Hill
and he's got...

186
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,632
"The History of My Skin," by Charles Simms.

187
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,052
You patronizing me, peewee? Hmm?

188
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:28,056
You givin' me that old prep school palaver?

189
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:30,601
Baird School!

190
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:35,481
A bunch of runny-nosed snots
in tweed jackets

191
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,108
all studyin' to be George Bush.

192
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,196
Well...

193
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,990
I believe President Bush
went to Andover, Colonel.

194
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,746
You sharpshootin' me, punk?

195
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,208
Is that what you're doin'?

196
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,419
Don't you sharpshoot me.

197
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,963
You'll give me 40.

198
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,591
Then you're gonna give me 40 more.

199
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,345
Then you're gonna pull K.P., the grease pit!

200
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:12,059
I'll rub your nose in enlisted men's crud
till you don't know which end is up!

201
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,061
You understand?

202
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,522
Yeah.

203
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:17,940
What do you want?

204
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,025
What do you mean, what do I want?

205
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,527
What do you want here?

206
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,948
I want a job.

207
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,617
A job!

208
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,869
Yeah, I want a job so I can make, you know,

209
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,372
my plane fare home for Christmas.

210
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,751
Oh, God, you're touching!

211
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,058
(SINGING)
They used to waltz on the banks

212
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,562
Of the mighty Mississippi

213
00:14:56,646 --> 00:15:00,482
Loving the whole night through

214
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,487
Till the riverboat gambler

215
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,574
Went off to make a killin'

216
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,493
And bring it on back to you

217
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,163
Still here, poormouth? Hmm?

218
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,544
Convenience store, my ass!

219
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:25,841
Hustlin' jalapeno dips to the appleseeds.

220
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,552
Go on.

221
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,846
Dismissed.

222
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,475
Dismissed!

223
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:48,864
Evangeline

224
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,450
Mrs. Rossi?

225
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,453
Charlie, we're up here! Come on up.

226
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,374
-This is Donny.
-Hey, Charlie.

227
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,043
Hi.

228
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:04,379
Mrs. Rossi, I got the feelin' I screwed up.

229
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,757
Oh, you couldn't have.

230
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,342
lt was a bad interview.

231
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,385
That was no interview, Charlie. You're it.

232
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,722
You're the only one that showed up.
You have to take the job.

233
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:18,435
He sleeps a lot. You can watch television,
call your girlfriend.

234
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,063
I promise you, an easy 300 bucks.

235
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,067
I don't get an easy feeling.

236
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,238
His bark is worse than his bite.

237
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,743
He was a great soldier, a real hero.

238
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,330
The man grows on you.

239
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,499
By Sunday night, you'll be best friends.

240
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,586
Charlie, please.

241
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,631
I want to get away with my husband
for a few days,

242
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,175
and Uncle Frank won't come with us.

243
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,428
Six months ago,
he could sometimes tell light from dark,

244
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,389
but now there's nothing.

245
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:58,517
I just feel better having
someone else around just in case.

246
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,441
Please?

247
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,946
Okay, Mrs. Rossi.

248
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,489
Sure.

249
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,866
Thank you, Charlie.

250
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,368
Come here, you.

251
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,378
There you go.

252
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,839
Chas. Chas, hold up.

253
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,551
-How you doin'?
-I'm good.

254
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:33,927
That's great.

255
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,555
This can't go out. This is on reserve.

256
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,893
Here's the thing.

257
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,771
l need the book tonight

258
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,400
for a Thanksgiving quiz
with big-shit Preston in the morning.

259
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,819
Yeah, l know.
That's why he put it on reserve.

260
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,195
This is our only copy.

261
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,614
Chas, I'm pullin' an all-nighter.

262
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,367
Without that book I'm dead, okay?

263
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,748
lf it's not back by 7:30, it's gonna be my ass.

264
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,958
Oh, l promise. l promise.

265
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,844
-Got it?
-Yeah.

266
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,819
Just a second. l gotta lock up.

267
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,825
Okay.

268
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,038
God, can you wait
to get out of this dump or what?

269
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:51,463
Where you guys going skiing again?
Sugarloaf or...

270
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,507
lt's bush, Chas, Sugarbush.

271
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,310
That's my boys.

272
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,312
What are you doin'?

273
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,315
Keep your voice down!

274
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,651
I'll tell you about it in the morning.

275
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:16,738
What...

276
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,199
Mrs. Hunsaker, have a nice day?

277
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,992
George, why all the noise?

278
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,497
lt's Hunsaker! Go! Go!

279
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,666
l was just messin' around with Chas.

280
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,917
Good evening, Charles.

281
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,377
Hi, Mrs. Hunsaker.

282
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,301
-What was that?
-l don't know, ma'am.

283
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,011
Who were those boys?

284
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,888
-Oh, who knows?
-What were they doing?

285
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,807
Charles?

286
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,519
Did you make this scarf yourself?

287
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,145
No, George, l bought it.

288
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,940
-'Cause it's a beauty. lt really is.
-Thank you, George.

289
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,776
ln case l don't see you
before the Thanksgiving holidays,

290
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,778
why don't you give me
one of your big hugs?

291
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,280
-Oh, George!
-Please?

292
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,781
-Good evening, boys.
-Come on.

293
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,283
Goodbye, Mrs. Hunsaker.

294
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,974
Mr. Trask is our fearless leader,

295
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,353
a man of learning, a voracious reader.

296
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,816
He could recite the Iliad in ancient Greek

297
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,321
while fishing for trout in a rippling creek.

298
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:44,659
Endowed with wisdom, ofjudgment sound,

299
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:49,164
nevertheless about him
the questions abound.

300
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:58,548
How does Mr. Trask
make such wonderful deals?

301
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,719
Why did the trustees
buy him Jaguar wheels?

302
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,513
He wasn't conniving.

303
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:08,099
He wasn't crass.

304
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,518
He merely puckered his lips

305
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:15,690
and kissed their ass!

306
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:37,045
Come on.

307
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,592
One more.

308
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:43,969
One more, come on!

309
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,156
Fuck you!

310
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:15,375
Mr. Simms, Mr. Willis.

311
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:22,757
Mrs. Hunsaker says that you gentlemen
were at a vantage point last night

312
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:26,261
to observe who was responsible for this

313
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,596
stunt.

314
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:35,895
Who was it?

315
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,065
l really couldn't tell you, sir.

316
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:43,737
l thought l saw someone
fooling with the lamppost,

317
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:48,283
but by the time l pulled focus,
they were gone.

318
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,618
Mr. Simms?

319
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:53,955
l couldn't say.

320
00:22:56,167 --> 00:23:00,170
That automobile is not just
a possession of mine.

321
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:05,091
That automobile was presented to me
by the board of trustees.

322
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:10,388
lt is a symbol of the standard of excellence
for which this school is known,

323
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:13,224
and l will not have it tarnished.

324
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:15,643
The automobile?

325
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,773
The standard, Mr. Willis.

326
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,320
What's your position, Mr. Simms?

327
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,489
On what, sir?

328
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,866
On preserving the reputation of Baird.

329
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,868
I'm for Baird.

330
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,870
Then, who did it?

331
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,332
l really couldn't say for sure.

332
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,547
Very well.

333
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,641
First thing Monday,
I'm convening a special session

334
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,976
of the student-faculty
disciplinary committee.

335
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,771
As this is a matter which concerns
the whole school,

336
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,649
the entire student body will be present.

337
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:05,276
There will be no classes, no activities.

338
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:10,865
Nothing will transpire at this institution
until that proceeding is concluded.

339
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,371
And if, at that time,
we are no further along than we are now,

340
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:20,291
l will expel you both.

341
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,258
Mr. Willis, would you excuse us?

342
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,347
Have a nice Thanksgiving.

343
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,767
Thank you. You, too, Mr. Willis.

344
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:39,144
l will.

345
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,194
Mr. Simms,

346
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,866
I'm not quite through with you yet.

347
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,377
One of the few perks of this office is that

348
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:09,591
l am empowered to handle certain matters
on my own as l see fit.

349
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,094
Do you understand?

350
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,762
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

351
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:18,349
The Dean ofAdmissions at Harvard
and l have an arrangement.

352
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:21,686
Along with the usual sheaf of applicants
submitted by Baird,

353
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:26,774
of which virtually two-thirds are
guaranteed admittance,

354
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,611
l add one name,

355
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:34,824
somebody who's a standout
and yet underprivileged.

356
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:40,163
A student who cannot afford to pay
the board and tuition in Cambridge.

357
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,336
Do you know on whose behalf
l drafted a memo this year?

358
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,546
No, sir.

359
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:49,839
You.

360
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,383
You, Mr. Simms.

361
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,847
Now can you tell me who did it?

362
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,893
No, sir, l can't.

363
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,147
You take the weekend
to think about it, Mr. Simms.

364
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:10,443
Good afternoon.

365
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:14,948
What'd he say?

366
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,533
-Nothin'.
-What do you mean, nothing?

367
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:20,328
He said the same thing. He just said it over.

368
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,080
You know what he's doing?

369
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:24,874
He's good-cop, bad-coppin' us.

370
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,627
He knows I'm old guard. You're fringe.

371
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,338
He's gonna bear down on me
and soft-soap you.

372
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,467
Did he try to soft-soap you?

373
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,718
Did he?

374
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:37,637
No.

375
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:41,933
Chas, l detect a slight panic pulse from you.
Are you panicking?

376
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,434
Yeah, a little.

377
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,687
Come on. You're on scholarship, right?

378
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:47,939
Yeah.

379
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,150
You're on scholarship from Oregon at Baird.

380
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,696
You're a long way from home, Chas.

381
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,490
What's that got to do with anything?

382
00:26:57,992 --> 00:27:00,285
l don't know how it works out there.

383
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:01,953
But how it works here?

384
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,788
We stick together.

385
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:06,332
lt's us against them, no matter what.

386
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:08,251
We don't cover our ass.

387
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,336
We don't tell our parents.

388
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,130
Stonewall everybody!

389
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:17,844
And above all, never, ever

390
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:21,055
leave any of us twisting in the wind.

391
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,475
And that's it.

392
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,270
What does that have to do with
me being on scholarship?

393
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,188
Hey, hey.

394
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:32,066
I'm just tryin' to bring you up to speed, kid,
that's it.

395
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,569
Thanks.

396
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,032
I'll tell you what.

397
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,909
Give me a few hours
to figure out the moves,

398
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,162
and call me tonight in Vermont.

399
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,666
I'll be at the Sugarbush lodge, all right?

400
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:49,917
All right.

401
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,837
You all right?

402
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:55,590
Yeah, l guess so.

403
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,426
Okay.

404
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,264
Try to keep him down to four drinks a day.

405
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:06,184
lf you can keep him down to 40,
you're doin' good.

406
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,853
We try to water them down a little.
Do you know how to do that?

407
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,897
lt's a long ride, honey.

408
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:13,441
Get the bags in the car. I'll be right out.

409
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:17,153
Mommy, Mommy,
don't forget Uncle Frank's walk.

410
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,948
Oh, yeah.

411
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,995
You have to air him out a little every day.

412
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:30,500
Why don't you go on back there,
get yourself oriented?

413
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,628
I'll come out in a minute,
give you telephone numbers and stuff.

414
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:39,801
Well, l wouldn't try a thing like that
unless l knew, would l?

415
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:41,803
Just let me speak to her.

416
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,138
Hello, beautiful. ls that you?

417
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,307
Yeah, we spoke yesterday.

418
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,814
You have a glass of wine with lunch?
You sound a little dusky. Hmm.

419
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,193
Just a minute, sweetheart.

420
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:00,321
You're back, huh?

421
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,907
Tenacious!

422
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,952
Get out my dress blues.
They're in a garment bag in the closet.

423
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,578
Check the top dresser drawer.

424
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:11,082
Take out the shoulder boards
and affix them, shoulders right and left,

425
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,626
ASAP. That means now.

426
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:16,337
Hello.

427
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:19,257
Sorry to keep you waiting, sweetheart.

428
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:21,968
I'm not the kind of guy
who likes to rush things,

429
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:24,929
but I'm catchin' a 4:00 at Logan,
I'm lookin' out my window,

430
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,806
and there's not a taxi in sight.

431
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,392
What happened to Chet?

432
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,310
He didn't invest in a radio yet?

433
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,312
Hah!

434
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,523
Well, get your driver on it.

435
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,609
Tell him to get a move on.

436
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:41,154
Yes. Mmm.

437
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,783
Some kind of body has got to
go with that bedroom voice.

438
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:48,369
One day I'm gonna swing by,
get a better look at it.

439
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,204
You bet.

440
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,374
Bye.

441
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,171
My Valpak's underneath the bed.

442
00:29:58,255 --> 00:29:59,672
Get it out.

443
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,341
Put the boards on the blues and fold 'em in.

444
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,970
Are we going someplace, Colonel?

445
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,722
What business is that of yours?

446
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,600
Don't shrug, imbecile. I'm blind.

447
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:13,060
Save your body language for the bimbi.

448
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,396
Now, get my gear out.

449
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,066
Francine, get in the car.

450
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:23,237
lt's almost 3:00.
The goddamn Flintstones haven't left yet.

451
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,908
Willie Rossi must go in the car.

452
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,161
Here comes Mrs. Rossi now.

453
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,454
Damn it!

454
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,415
She said goodbye to me three times today.

455
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,002
What has she got, separation anxiety?

456
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,921
Cut her off at the door.

457
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:44,425
Hi, honey. Bye, honey.

458
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,640
l wish you were coming with us.

459
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,517
Me, too.

460
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:53,935
Maybe next time.

461
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,942
-Drive carefully now.
-Yeah.

462
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:05,238
Charlie, this is where we'll be.

463
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:09,617
Good luck, Charlie.
Don't let him drink too much.

464
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,331
See you, Charlie.

465
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,960
And no 900 numbers. He loves to talk dirty.

466
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,470
All right, let's get to work.

467
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,648
L-buckles givin' you trouble?

468
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:44,902
Never in the Boy Scouts, sluggo?

469
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:46,654
l made Tenderfoot.

470
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,573
Tenderfoot, my foot!

471
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,992
Convenience store mama's boy.

472
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,994
Here. Let me take a look at that.

473
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:57,331
Touch me again, I'll kill you,
you little son of a bitch!

474
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,126
l touch you.

475
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:03,504
Understand?

476
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,051
My shoulder boards are in
the top dresser drawer.

477
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:10,469
Get them, son.

478
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,555
The epaulets with the silver oak leaf.

479
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:32,450
Are these the...

480
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:34,535
Good. Taxi come yet?

481
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,372
Colonel, where are we going?

482
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,416
Where are we going?

483
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,668
Freak show central.

484
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:44,712
-Where's that?
-New York City.

485
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,050
That's in New York, son.

486
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,135
New York State.

487
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:54,096
Mrs. Rossi didn't say anything to me
about going anywhere.

488
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:55,389
She forgot.

489
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,225
Should we call her, 'cause l...

490
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,894
You kidding me?

491
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,689
Call her? By the time they get to Albany
in that Hupmobile he drives

492
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:06,025
it'll be opening day at Saratoga.

493
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,319
Colonel, l can't go to New York City.

494
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,570
Why not?

495
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:12,239
New York...

496
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,575
New York's too much responsibility.

497
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,494
Ah, responsibility!

498
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,288
l had a lot of 1 7-year-olds
in my first platoon.

499
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:21,582
l took care of them. All set!

500
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:25,294
How do l look?

501
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,923
Tickets. Money.

502
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:30,800
Speech.

503
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:34,970
Old Washington joke
from my days with Lyndon.

504
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,266
l knew l could count
on transportation.

505
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,685
Are you ready?

506
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,773
This is not Panmunjom.
A simple yes will do.

507
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,609
-Um...
-Good! Here you go.

508
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,528
Come on! Hop to, son!

509
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,656
You're in front of me. Let's go.

510
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,368
Tomster, come here, boy.

511
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,496
Come on.

512
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,540
Here, Tomster, come on.

513
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,917
Tomster, Tomster. Yeah.

514
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:09,255
Remember, when in doubt,

515
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:11,090
fuck.

516
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,762
Good afternoon, sir.
Where's our destination?

517
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:20,015
Our destination,
New York City, home of the brave!

518
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,059
We got two for the shuttle to New York.

519
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:25,104
I'm not shuttling anywhere.
Look at those tickets. First class.

520
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,897
Yes, sir, first class.

521
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:28,983
Colonel, you bought me a ticket?

522
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,735
l never said l'd go to New York.

523
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:34,780
Oh, what are you, some kind of chicken-shit,
sticks to job description only?

524
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:36,741
Gate 46, sir.

525
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,325
As you were, son.

526
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,910
Thank you, sir.

527
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:41,454
Which way's the door?

528
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,624
Are you blind? Are you blind?

529
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:46,959
Of course not.

530
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,503
Then why do you keep grabbin'
my goddamn arm?

531
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:52,173
l take your arm.

532
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,721
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be sorry.

533
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,348
How would you know,
watchin' MTV all your life?

534
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,517
-Gentlemen?
-Yeah!

535
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:08,230
-Jack Daniels.
-You bet.

536
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:12,026
And Diet Slice.

537
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,360
The old Diet Slice.

538
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,820
And a water.

539
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:17,114
-Thank you, Daphne.
-Certainly, sir.

540
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,208
-Mmm!
-How did you know her name?

541
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:31,587
Well, she's wearin' Floris.

542
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,381
That's an English cologne.

543
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:38,886
But her voice is California chickie.

544
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:42,848
Now, California chickie
bucking for English lady.

545
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,059
I call her Daphne.

546
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:50,981
Oh, big things may happen
to that little thing of yours.

547
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:54,485
Look, Colonel,

548
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,531
-I'll get you to New York, all right?
-Uh-huh.

549
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:01,408
Then I'm gonna have to
turn around and come back.

550
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:04,245
Well, Chuck,
you gotta do what you gotta do.

551
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:06,747
Charlie, all right?

552
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,541
Or Charles.

553
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:10,918
Sorry. I can't blame you, though.

554
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,253
Chuck is a...

555
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,300
So, why are we going to New York?

556
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:21,929
All information will be given
on a need-to-know basis.

557
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,515
Hoo-ah.

558
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,476
Where's Daphne? Let's get her down here.

559
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,022
She's in the back.

560
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,149
A tail's in the tail.

561
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:36,777
Hah!

562
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,029
Oh, but I still smell her.

563
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,201
Women.

564
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,288
What can you say?

565
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,249
Who made 'em?

566
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,961
God must have been a fuckin' genius.

567
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,675
The hair...

568
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,220
They say the hair is everything, you know.

569
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:09,018
Have you ever buried your nose
in a mountain of curls

570
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,605
and just wanted to go to sleep forever?

571
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:15,816
Or lips,

572
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:20,070
and when they touched, yours were like

573
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:23,324
that first swallow of wine

574
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,327
after you just crossed the desert.

575
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,123
Tits!

576
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,625
Hoo-ah.

577
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,170
Big ones, little ones,

578
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:41,634
nipples staring right out at you
like secret searchlights.

579
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,928
Mmm.

580
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:47,681
And legs...

581
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,186
I don't care if they're Greek columns

582
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,438
or secondhand Steinways.

583
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,358
What's between 'em,

584
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,153
passport to heaven.

585
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,615
I need a drink.

586
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:09,954
Yes, Mr. Simms,

587
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:16,251
there's only two syllables
in this whole wide world worth hearing.

588
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,050
Pussy.

589
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,511
Hah!

590
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:28,806
Are you listening to me, son?
I'm givin' you pearls here.

591
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,601
I guess you really like women.

592
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:35,229
Oh, above all things!

593
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:44,530
A very, very distant second

594
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,866
is a Ferrari.

595
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,875
Charlie?

596
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,130
Give me your hand.

597
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:06,260
This is just the start of your education, son.

598
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,444
Hoo-ah.

599
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:25,320
Where are we?

600
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:26,864
Where are we, eh?

601
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:30,492
The cynosure of all things civilized.

602
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,619
The Waldorf-Astoria.

603
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,332
The last time I was here, Charlie,
was with a G-2 from Brussels.

604
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:38,834
Had a Ferrari.

605
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:42,212
Every day I held the door open
for the fucker.

606
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,465
Never even offered me a ride.

607
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,467
Well, fuck him.

608
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,635
He's dead and I'm blind.

609
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:53,974
Spread the word.

610
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,225
Thank you, sir.

611
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,227
And the intelligence will be forthcoming?

612
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,479
Sir?

613
00:39:58,563 --> 00:39:59,980
On the escort scene.

614
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:02,900
Yes, sir.

615
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,943
And welcome to the Waldorf.

616
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,361
Gracias, amigo.

617
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:09,656
Puerto Ricans.

618
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,575
Always made the best infantrymen.

619
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,209
Oh!

620
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,509
I'm home again.

621
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:31,678
Give me an inventory on this, will you?

622
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,937
All right, where am I, in Asia?

623
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:43,107
He told me the phone was on
the other side of the room, didn't he?

624
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,566
By the windows?

625
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,402
It's right here.

626
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:50,531
Okay.

627
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:52,574
We're in business.

628
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:58,872
Get me the Oak Room.

629
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,668
How's that inventory comin'?

630
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,547
There's Jim Beam

631
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:09,133
and Early Times.

632
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,051
Quartermaster's on the take again.

633
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,221
Hello. Is Sheldon or Mack there?

634
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:18,350
This is Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade.

635
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,812
I used to be a regular.
I used to come in with a General Garbisch.

636
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:27,109
Yes, that's probably because
he's at Arlington, six feet under.

637
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:30,696
Listen up. I want a table for two,
and I don't mean Siberia,

638
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:32,239
8:1 5.

639
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:35,367
Clear them little bottles off.

640
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:39,204
And when I get off the phone,
call up Hyman.

641
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:42,249
Tell him I want it wall to wall
with John Daniels.

642
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,627
Don't you mean Jack Daniels?

643
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:49,506
He may be Jack to you, son. But when
you've known him as long as I have...

644
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:50,966
That's a joke. Hello!

645
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,052
This is Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade.
I would like a limo,

646
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:55,470
8:00.

647
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,354
What are you drinkin'?

648
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:07,608
Nothing, thanks. I don't use it.

649
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,526
What's useful about it?

650
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:14,406
I don't know.
Listen, Colonel, I have to get going.

651
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:16,825
Where you goin'?

652
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:21,413
Back to school. I've got some real
important stuff I have to take care of.

653
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,373
Very well.

654
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,544
But I never let my aides leave
on an empty stomach.

655
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:31,089
You'll dine with me
and then my driver will transport you

656
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:34,259
to the airport for the Boston shuttle
departing at 2200 hours.

657
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:39,223
Meanwhile, unpack my bag.

658
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,350
I'm gonna christen the latrine.

659
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:45,771
What's your name, driver?

660
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:46,980
Manny, sir.

661
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:52,027
Manny. The bellhops at the Waldorf,
are they any good at getting escorts?

662
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,071
I wouldn't know, sir.

663
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,614
What would you know?

664
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,532
About what?

665
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:59,326
About you-know-what?

666
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,455
Maybe I could manage something.

667
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,916
I'm talkin' top of the line, now.

668
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,709
Let me think about this, sir.

669
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,887
What's the matter with you?

670
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:20,180
With me?

671
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:22,891
Yeah. Car feels heavy. You know why?

672
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:25,852
You got the fuckin' weight of the world
on your shoulders.

673
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:32,567
I got a little problem at school, that's all.

674
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:33,944
Spit it out!

675
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,612
It's not a big deal, all right?

676
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,656
Where we going,
the Oak Room or somethin'?

677
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,450
If it's not a big deal,
why did you say real important stuff?

678
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:43,704
What are you doin',
banging the dean's daughter? Hah!

679
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,833
I'm just in a little trouble.

680
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:49,376
What kind of trouble?

681
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:52,045
I saw some guys doing something.

682
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:57,968
To tell or not to tell, or it's your ass.

683
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:00,220
Hmm?

684
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:03,307
How'd you know that?

685
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:06,018
I'm a wizard. Give me the details, come on.

686
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:14,192
There's this guy at school named Harry.

687
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:18,113
He's this real rich kid,
and he like, runs the show.

688
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,240
Who else?

689
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:25,954
There's another guy, George,
but George didn't do anything.

690
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:29,916
George and I saw Harry and his buddies
doin' somethin'.

691
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:32,044
Now, the folks at Baird,

692
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:35,255
they know you and George
can identify the guilty parties?

693
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,260
Yeah, they think we can.

694
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,137
George is a friend of yours.

695
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:45,182
He's not a friend, but he's all right.

696
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:46,683
You trust him?

697
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,769
Yeah, I guess so.

698
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:51,396
He's on scholarship, too?

699
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,815
No, why?

700
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:57,194
We got George, we got Harry,
we got trouble.

701
00:44:57,278 --> 00:45:00,113
They're rich, you're poor.
You wanna get rich.

702
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:03,575
You wanna graduate Baird,
become a rich big shot like them.

703
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,077
-Am I right?
-No.

704
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:06,953
It's not that way at all.

705
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,122
Okay, Charlie!

706
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,460
Here we are, gentlemen, the Oak Room.

707
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,545
The Oak Room!

708
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:19,049
Bring us a menu
and double Jack Daniels on the rocks.

709
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,051
Charlie, sit down here.

710
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,929
Perhaps you'll feel more
comfortable in this, sir.

711
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:32,312
You look great!

712
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:38,568
Thank you.

713
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,864
Here we are, Charlie, the Oak Room.

714
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:46,118
Now, read me the bill of fare.

715
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,412
Let's see.

716
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:51,832
You got the Oak Room
burger and fries for $24.

717
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,542
Where's the booze?

718
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:55,168
Flowin' like mud around here.

719
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:56,711
A $24 hamburger?

720
00:45:58,256 --> 00:45:59,506
What's the story?

721
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,174
What story?

722
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:04,469
Are you a rich miser or something?

723
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:06,138
Hah!

724
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:08,682
No, I'm just your average blind man.

725
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,517
Your average blind man.

726
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,229
How do you plan on
paying for all this stuff?

727
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:16,731
Crisp, clean dollars.

728
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:18,275
American.

729
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,318
I saved up my disability checks.

730
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:23,613
How much did you save?
I mean, we flew first class,

731
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:27,033
we're at the Waldorf-Astoria,
a $24 hamburger restaurant.

732
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,035
All part of a plan, Charlie.

733
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,745
You want to let me in on it?

734
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:33,582
Why should I?
You're not interested. You don't give a shit!

735
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:37,961
You're leavin' on that last shuttle
out of LaGuardia.

736
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,880
Hmm? Ooh!

737
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:45,177
You got 1 5 minutes, son.
I don't think you're gonna make it.

738
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:49,431
Unless the Oak Room keeps some
complimentary helicopter on the roof.

739
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:51,683
No, sir. No!

740
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,811
You're here till tomorrow.

741
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,523
You said the last shuttle
leaves at 2200 hours.

742
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:00,567
That's 1 0:00, right?

743
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,069
Last I heard, yeah.

744
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,405
It's only 8:30.

745
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,908
I lied. Leaves at 9:00.

746
00:47:08,618 --> 00:47:10,035
It leaves at 9:00?

747
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:11,870
Calm down. Calm down.

748
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,250
The truth is, Charlie,

749
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:22,756
I need a guide dog
to help me execute my plan.

750
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:24,549
What plan?

751
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:27,636
You have a right to know.

752
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:32,098
It's not really a plan, Charlie. It's sort of a...

753
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:34,601
More like a tour,

754
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:37,646
a little tour of pleasures.

755
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:42,067
Stay in a first-class hotel,
eat an agreeable meal,

756
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,111
drink a nice glass of wine,

757
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,323
see my big brother.

758
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,076
Nothing like family, you know.

759
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,121
And then, make love to a terrific woman.

760
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,875
After that...

761
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,091
Yeah?

762
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:12,973
I'm gonna lie down on
my big, beautiful bed at the Waldorf

763
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:14,891
and blow my brains out.

764
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:20,564
May I tell you our specials?

765
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:22,148
You may, sir.

766
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:27,028
Tonight we have charred venison with
buckwheat spaetzle and green peppercorn.

767
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:30,740
Grilled veal paillards,
tomato tapenade, and roasted eggplants.

768
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:32,701
Get me a napkin. My mouth's watering.

769
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:34,995
If you would like our
crème soufflé for dessert,

770
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,997
it would be a good idea to order now.

771
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:41,042
Yes, on the soufflé.
Give us a half a minute on the rest.

772
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:42,877
Very good, sir.

773
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,009
I'm leaning towards the spaetzle.

774
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:52,429
-Colonel Slade...
-Charlie, rolls on the table?

775
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:53,680
Give 'em to me.

776
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,974
You should try these rolls, Charlie.

777
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:59,603
I used to dream about them
when I was at Fort Huachuca.

778
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:02,355
-Colonel Slade...
-Bread's no good west of the Colorado.

779
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,232
Water's too alkaline.

780
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:05,775
Colonel Slade, did you say...

781
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,279
Did I hear you right?

782
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:12,949
You said you're gonna kill yourself?

783
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:14,326
No.

784
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,369
I said I was gonna blow my brains out.

785
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:19,664
Try one of these rolls, Charlie.

786
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:21,708
I buttered it for you.

787
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,877
I don't want a roll, all right?

788
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,712
Okay. Have a radish!

789
00:49:26,756 --> 00:49:28,048
Hah!

790
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:33,428
Hello! Bring me a double Jack Daniels
on the rocks.

791
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,804
Yes, sir. Right away.

792
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,311
Please, don't do that.

793
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,064
Don't do that.

794
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:51,905
Hmm.

795
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:56,993
What a marvelous place.

796
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:02,082
Okay.

797
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:06,628
Yeah.

798
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,424
Your billet is here.

799
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,969
You'll find bedding
in the closet on the shelf.

800
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:20,016
In the morning, the area will be
returned to sitting-room mode

801
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:22,435
no later than 0700 hours.

802
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:27,899
What was that?

803
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:31,778
Nothing.

804
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,865
Next time snap it out!

805
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:42,414
Thumb to palm, index finger
through little digit, smartly aligned,

806
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,334
sharp to the hairline, down!

807
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:55,343
Too many men, far better than you,
have executed that courtesy.

808
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:59,139
And if you're smart, you won't try it again.

809
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:07,647
This bat has got sharper radar
than the Nautilus.

810
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:10,608
Don't fuck with me, Charlie.

811
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:24,205
See you get a good night's sleep, son.

812
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:39,012
(SINGING) It's a lovely day today

813
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,931
So, whatever you gotta do

814
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:45,268
You got a lovely day to do it in, that's true

815
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:53,777
Good morning, Charlie.

816
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,822
Good morning.

817
00:51:58,157 --> 00:51:59,908
This is Sofia, Charlie.

818
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:02,285
She's a magician with a needle.

819
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,371
Sofia's workin' me up
a little Glen Plaid number,

820
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:08,666
and I've asked her if she'd
put something together for you.

821
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:10,960
I don't need any clothes, Colonel.

822
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:14,130
Standard issue
for an upscale urban assignment.

823
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:17,008
You don't like the clothes, Charlie,
on completion of duty,

824
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:19,135
you can give 'em away.

825
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:22,806
Juice, coffee, and other assorted goodies
on the trolley over there.

826
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:25,099
Get yourself up, get yourself together.

827
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:29,312
It's a great day forsingin' a song

828
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:32,732
And it's a great day for movin' along

829
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:35,401
And it's a great day from morning to night

830
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:37,487
And it's a great day

831
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:40,657
For everybody's plight

832
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,040
How are you feeling today, Colonel?

833
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,416
Super!

834
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,043
Superior!

835
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,753
Superfluous!

836
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,465
Young Sofie here is working Thanksgiving

837
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:00,051
because she's trying to
put herself through college.

838
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:03,179
I told her, "My young friend Charlie's
headed for college."

839
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:04,806
Excuse me.

840
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,099
Where you goin'?

841
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,809
I need to use the phone.

842
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:10,103
What's wrong with the phones in here?

843
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:12,272
l don't want to disturb you.

844
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:14,941
You're not disturbing me. Make your call.

845
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:16,693
I'd kind of like to be private.

846
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:18,444
Stay out of my room!

847
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:21,739
This is as private as you're gonna get.

848
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:28,872
(SINGING) But ifyou've got
somethin' that must be done

849
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:33,126
And it can only be done by one

850
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:36,170
Sofia,

851
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:40,258
what are the chances
of suitin' you up sometime?

852
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,971
Sugarbush Lodge.
-George Willis, please.

853
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:48,892
Hello.

854
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:50,560
George! Hey, it's Charlie.

855
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:54,272
Hey, Chas.
Next year you gotta come up with us.

856
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,650
White powder on a base of snow bunnies.

857
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:01,362
Chas, are you there?

858
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:03,740
Yeah, I'm here.

859
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:06,159
You told me to call you for the moves.

860
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,493
All right.

861
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:10,914
For now, the move's no move, status quo.

862
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,707
Everything's the way we left it.

863
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,250
How did we leave it?

864
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,087
See no evil, hear no evil.

865
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,049
You know what I mean, Chas?

866
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:25,511
Yeah. See no evil, hear no evil.

867
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,974
Okay, then, walk like you talk.

868
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:32,310
All right, bye.

869
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,021
George Willis, huh?

870
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,190
Yeah.

871
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:39,442
George Willis.

872
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:42,779
That makes his father
probably George Willis, Senior.

873
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,782
Charlie, I ask you,

874
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:49,786
what do you think
big George is gonna feel about little George

875
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:52,914
seeing no evil, hearing no evil?

876
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:57,585
Well, we're not gonna tell our parents.

877
00:54:57,795 --> 00:55:00,713
We're just gonna keep it between ourselves.

878
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:04,217
Oh, George isn't gonna tell his father
about this thing!

879
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,177
Damn decent of him.

880
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:10,014
-Scusi, Colonnello.
-Prego.

881
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:11,891
I love it when you hurt me.

882
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:15,228
Tell me now, Charlie.

883
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:19,273
This George Willis, Jr., what's his father do?

884
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:21,734
I don't really know.

885
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,653
Well, I'm gonna tell you.

886
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:25,822
When George Willis, Senior,

887
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:28,616
isn't busy as a million-dollar man
for Aetna Casualty...

888
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:32,495
Or is it New England distributor
for the Chrysler Corporation?

889
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:36,582
He concerns himself with
his young son, George Willis, Jr.

890
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:39,919
George isn't going to say anything
to his father.

891
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:41,754
Oh, Charlie.

892
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:44,465
Big George is gonna wind up little George,

893
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,552
and little George is gonna
sing like a canary.

894
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:50,138
And if you're hip, kid,
you're gonna hop to, too.

895
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:52,682
You've got this all figured out, don't you?

896
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:56,853
It don't take no Young American merit
scholarship to figure this one out.

897
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:58,980
Charlie, you had a little life,

898
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:03,860
so you decided to go to the Baird school
to put yourself in the market for a big one.

899
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:05,820
Now, in order to stay in the running,

900
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:09,741
you're gonna have to tell these people
what they want to know.

901
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:11,534
You think so?

902
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:12,660
Are we finished, Sofia?

903
00:56:12,745 --> 00:56:14,412
-Yes.
-Grazie. Grazie. Andate.

904
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,417
Charlie,

905
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:22,795
if you don't sing now,

906
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:26,841
you're gonna end up,
not only shelving biscuits

907
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,886
in some convenience store
in the Oregon 'burbs,

908
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:32,805
but probably the last word
you'll ever hear yourself say

909
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,099
just before you croak, gonna be,

910
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:38,978
"Have a nice day and come back soon."

911
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:40,897
Sofia!

912
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:42,732
Measure up Charlie, here, pronto.

913
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,776
We got a date for Thanksgiving.

914
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:46,694
We got a date?

915
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:48,821
My brother's place.

916
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:52,116
W.R. Slade, White Plains, New York.

917
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:55,161
Colonel, I can't go with you
to your brother's place.

918
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:58,331
I mean, I should be getting back to school.

919
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:04,921
Well, you gotta have
Thanksgiving somewhere.

920
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:07,090
I mean, eats and treats.

921
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:09,008
I can use the company, Charlie.

922
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:13,888
All right.

923
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,431
Does he know I'm comin'?

924
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:16,933
He doesn't know I'm comin'.

925
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:20,436
But wait till you see the look on his face
when I walk through the door.

926
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:22,063
Oh, he loves me!

927
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:28,236
Oh, Charlie, about your little problem,

928
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:35,201
those who stand up and face the music,
and those who run for cover.

929
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,828
Cover's better.

930
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:39,038
Okay, Sofia, suit him up!

931
00:57:39,123 --> 00:57:40,748
Make him pretty.

932
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:58,808
Careful.

933
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:02,061
-Should I ring it?
-Yeah.

934
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,156
-Yes?
-Yes!

935
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,740
Who is this?

936
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:16,617
It's Randy.

937
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:18,619
Randy? You new?

938
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:21,080
I'm your nephew.

939
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:23,583
Hah! Here I am!

940
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:25,668
Your sister's been hoarding me
long enough.

941
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,713
Thought it's time
to spread the riches around.

942
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:31,382
-Uncle Frank.
-Gloria!

943
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:33,426
-Gail.
-Of course.

944
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:37,054
Say hello to the potluck party
from New York City.

945
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:40,516
Good old Uncle Frank
and this here with him is Charlie Simms,

946
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:43,436
star halfback of the Baird football team.

947
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,398
They not only beat Exeter and Groton,
but Aquinas High School, too.

948
00:58:48,317 --> 00:58:50,067
Where's your miserable father?

949
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:52,403
Wait! No, no. Let's surprise him.

950
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:56,115
Give that fat heart of his an attack. Willie!

951
00:58:58,118 --> 00:58:59,577
Ho, Willie!

952
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,300
Hello, Frank.

953
00:59:14,843 --> 00:59:17,053
-How you doin'?
-Okay.

954
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:18,554
Here's my hand.

955
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:22,433
Charlie, meet W.R. Slade.

956
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:23,893
Nice to meet you, sir.

957
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,729
The original bulging briefcase man.

958
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:29,565
Gretchen, I smell those prunes!

959
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:31,734
-We talkin' turkey Marbella?
-Yes, we are.

960
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:36,614
Let's have a whiff. Come on.

961
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,699
You know, I always had a sneaker for you.
Come here.

962
00:59:42,955 --> 00:59:45,248
-Where are you, Garry? I heard you cough.
Right here.

963
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:46,958
Who are you again?

964
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:51,921
I'm here at the Waldorf with...
Is it your brother?

965
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:54,507
W.R.'s final issue. How ya doin', son?

966
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:57,093
Yeah, sure, Frank's my brother.
Who the hell are you?

967
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,845
I'm takin' care of him for the weekend.

968
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,097
Charlie.

969
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,141
Sorry.

970
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:06,352
Where's the booze?

971
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:07,937
Flowin' like mud here.

972
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:11,691
To tell the truth,
the Colonel's not well, I don't think.

973
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,359
Not well?

974
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,736
I think he's a little lonely.

975
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:18,447
Why didn't you take him
to your family's for dinner?

976
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:20,032
I heard that!

977
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,369
I heard that.

978
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:26,622
Pay no attention to him, Charlie.
That's just big-brother talk.

979
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:29,292
He's been watching out
for me since day one.

980
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:34,297
Bailed me out of more trouble
than he'd like to remember. Hmm?

981
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:36,257
Here, let me take your coat.

982
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:40,511
I meant to pick up some vino on my way up,
but I blew it.

983
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:43,139
I'll send you the Rothschild again
for Christmas,

984
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:45,599
only let's see how Thanksgiving goes.

985
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:47,101
I'll set two more places.

986
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,561
Here's your drink, Frank.

987
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,438
Oh, thank you, Randy.

988
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:52,732
Still with Snow Queen Sugar?

989
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:56,902
Snow Flake.
Why do you always get that wrong?

990
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:59,280
Because it's not important
for me to get it right.

991
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:00,990
What are you doing there now?

992
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,576
I'm vice president for marketing.

993
01:01:03,744 --> 01:01:06,412
Hoo-ah! Congratulations!

994
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,039
Sugar is shit, though.

995
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:11,334
I told General Abrams,
install honey in the commissaries.

996
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:15,171
If K-50s didn't blow your brains out,
sugar, sure as shit, was gonna.

997
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:17,506
Why don't we all sit down?

998
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:18,632
Ooh. (SNIFFING)

999
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:22,511
Mitsouki. Rhymes with nookie. Be careful.

1000
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:25,348
When the wife gets restless,
the wife gets racy.

1001
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:27,016
Well, let's go and eat, shall we?

1002
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,517
By all means.

1003
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:31,729
Thank you, Charlie.

1004
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:35,900
Where you wanna sit, Frank?
At the head again?

1005
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:39,779
Any old card table will do. This is fine.

1006
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,032
Where was I? Oh.

1007
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:46,369
So, I wake up. It's 4:00 in the morning.
I don't know who I'm with

1008
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:48,788
or why I'm there, or where I am.

1009
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:52,249
What am I gonna do? I got this Asian flower

1010
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:56,629
on one hand, all giggly and dewy-like,

1011
01:01:57,047 --> 01:02:01,050
and this hard-boiled Navy nurse
outta Omaha, on the other.

1012
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:04,887
We're three across the bed,
not a stitch of clothes on.

1013
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:06,764
It comes to me.

1014
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:12,144
Let east meet west.
We'll build a golden bridge.

1015
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:17,233
I felt like I'd just joined
the corps of engineers!

1016
01:02:23,323 --> 01:02:24,990
We all still here?

1017
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:27,952
It's a beautiful story.

1018
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:34,083
Do you always enjoy
shocking people, Uncle Frank?

1019
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,251
Honey...

1020
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:37,753
I didn't know
you were so easily shocked, Randy.

1021
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:40,047
I admire your sensibilities, I'm touched.

1022
01:02:40,132 --> 01:02:43,092
Dad, remember the time
you persuaded Frank

1023
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,261
to go to the kennel?

1024
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:46,429
What about it?

1025
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:48,764
He almost put the seeing eye dog business
outta business.

1026
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:50,015
Cool it, Randy.

1027
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,976
It's over and done with.

1028
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:54,270
Indeed it is, Garry.

1029
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:56,439
Indeed it is. So is dinner.

1030
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:58,107
Charlie, what time you have?

1031
01:02:58,191 --> 01:02:59,692
I think we better be gettin' back.

1032
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,862
You ever given any thought to
a Braille watch, Frank?

1033
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:03,946
Randy...

1034
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:07,575
Stevie Wonder wears one,
or do you rank on him, too?

1035
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:08,784
Honey, please.

1036
01:03:08,869 --> 01:03:11,162
It's all right, Gloria.
I enjoy Randy's observations.

1037
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:13,372
My wife's name is Gail, Frank.

1038
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:15,332
Can you hear that? Gail.

1039
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:17,710
Excuse me. Gail.

1040
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:21,338
Gail strikes me as a very beautiful woman,

1041
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:24,175
but, you know,
there's a little tension in her voice.

1042
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:27,011
I don't know what it is.
It could be one of two things,

1043
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:29,722
either Gail is nervous or unsatisfied.

1044
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:33,559
What's your point, Uncle Frank?

1045
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,102
You ought to go down on her.

1046
01:03:35,187 --> 01:03:37,438
-Cut it out, Frank, will ya?

1047
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:41,650
You've gotten so wrapped up in sugar,
you forgotten the taste of real honey!

1048
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:43,194
Frank, for God's sake!

1049
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:44,361
Hear that voice?

1050
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:45,988
There's fire under that dress.

1051
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,199
-Will you cut it out?
-Just get the fuck outta here.

1052
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:50,242
-Hoo-ah!
Get in your limousine.

1053
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:54,371
Go down to the Bowery. Get with
the other fucking drunks, where you belong!

1054
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:55,539
Wait a minute.

1055
01:03:55,624 --> 01:03:57,416
-What?
-Can you take it easy?

1056
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:58,584
What for?

1057
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:02,171
You want me to lay off him, Chucky,
'cause he's blind?

1058
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:03,672
No, but...

1059
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:05,758
My friend's name is Charles.

1060
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,760
He doesn't like to be called Chucky.

1061
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:10,221
This is supposed to be
a family get-together.

1062
01:04:10,305 --> 01:04:11,639
Just a warning.

1063
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:15,518
Jesus Christ, another sucker who thinks
this shit-heel's a war hero.

1064
01:04:15,644 --> 01:04:16,727
Hoo-ah!

1065
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:21,857
Well, once, maybe.

1066
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:26,278
I suppose he told you about his days
on Lyndon Johnson's staff?

1067
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:28,948
I was gonna go. Now I'm not leaving. Hah!

1068
01:04:29,658 --> 01:04:31,909
Frank was earmarked for general.

1069
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,078
Earmarked, good word.

1070
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:36,539
Frank likes to spit in everybody's eye!

1071
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:37,873
Randy, that's enough.

1072
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:42,294
So they, what do they call it,
when they give you the shaft in the military?

1073
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:43,671
Passed over!

1074
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:46,674
Right, Frank was passed over for promotion.

1075
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:48,884
Couple times.

1076
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:54,181
You wanna know what happened then?

1077
01:04:54,266 --> 01:04:55,724
Will you shut your mouth?

1078
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,142
He blew himself up.

1079
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:58,644
Stop it, Randy.

1080
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,897
Our Colonel here had a grenade juggling act

1081
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:04,400
at Fort Bragg, or wherever
it was they dumped him.

1082
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:05,484
Fort Benning.

1083
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:08,404
He was teaching hand-to-hand combat
to second lieutenants...

1084
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:10,948
Randy, look at me
when you're talking to me, now, son.

1085
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:15,286
I'm lookin', Frank.
His partner in the act was some captain.

1086
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:16,912
Major Vincent Squires.

1087
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:18,163
Whoever he was.

1088
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:20,916
Before going on,
they'd have a lo-cal breakfast,

1089
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:23,794
a screwdriver for Frank,
bloody mary for his partner.

1090
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:25,629
No, Vincent drank Sea Breezes.

1091
01:05:25,714 --> 01:05:30,843
The Judge Advocate at Benning said
Colonel Slade had four to his partner's one.

1092
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:34,555
He's really flying in class.
He gets all excited.

1093
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:36,974
He starts pulling the pins out.

1094
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:41,687
One grenade got away from him.

1095
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:43,188
Boom.

1096
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:47,693
The one that got away.

1097
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,404
The pin was in, Frank claims.

1098
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:53,991
In or out, what difference does it make?

1099
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:56,952
What kind of fucking lunatic
juggles grenades?

1100
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:58,912
Vinnie came out okay.

1101
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:01,206
All Frank lost was his eyesight.

1102
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:06,712
You wanna know the truth?

1103
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,297
Got a handle on that, do you?

1104
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:09,798
He was an asshole before.

1105
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:11,133
Hoo-ah!

1106
01:06:12,844 --> 01:06:15,304
Now all he is, is a blind asshole.

1107
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:16,680
Hoo-ah.

1108
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:25,564
Hey, God's a funny guy.

1109
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:30,027
God doth have a sense of humor.

1110
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:36,116
Maybe God thinks
some people don't deserve to see.

1111
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:38,661
Hoo-ah.

1112
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:45,501
You get the point, Chucky?

1113
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:52,257
His name is Charles.

1114
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:55,010
You can say that, can't you? Charles.

1115
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:57,513
Know what this is, Randy?
It's a Ranger choke hold.

1116
01:06:57,597 --> 01:06:59,973
-From teaching those lieutenants.
-Colonel, let go.

1117
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:02,434
Little pressure, I bust your windpipe.

1118
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:04,269
I don't care what he said to me.
-After me.

1119
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:05,521
Charles.

1120
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:07,272
Just let go, please!

1121
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,544
Gretchen?

1122
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:31,839
You outdid yourself.

1123
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:38,387
If you twist my arm hard enough,
we're talking turkey Marbella next year.

1124
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,556
Who knows?

1125
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,272
Frank?

1126
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:51,233
Goodbye, Willie.

1127
01:07:55,864 --> 01:07:57,614
I'm no fucking good.

1128
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:01,952
And I never have been.

1129
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:10,335
Come on, Charlie, get the coats.

1130
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:19,094
Colonel. Watch your step.

1131
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:23,098
Hold it.

1132
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:40,783
Nueva York, compadre. Vamos!

1133
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:27,329
You got a watch?

1134
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:32,459
It's 7:20.

1135
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:36,755
I didn't ask you the time.
I asked if you had a watch.

1136
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:39,132
Yeah, in the other room.

1137
01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:40,425
Get it.

1138
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:47,808
Colonel, there's a clock
right next to your bed.

1139
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:51,103
Does it have a second hand?

1140
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,236
-Yeah.
-Time me!

1141
01:10:27,015 --> 01:10:28,432
How long?

1142
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,979
About 30 seconds.

1143
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:35,647
I'm rusty.

1144
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:38,483
Where did you get a gun, Colonel?

1145
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:41,194
Piece or weapon, Charlie, never gun.

1146
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:46,283
Where did you get the piece?

1147
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:49,161
I'm an officer in the US Army.

1148
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,996
This is my sidearm.

1149
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:53,749
But you're not an officer anymore.

1150
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,667
So I'm retired, so what?

1151
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:58,921
An officer never relinquishes his .45.

1152
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:03,300
You better relinquish it to me
or I'm gonna have to call Mrs. Rossi.

1153
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:04,968
Good idea.

1154
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:08,096
Then I'm going back to school.

1155
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:10,724
Even better. Blue skies, green lights.

1156
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:12,517
I hope you have a wonderful trip.

1157
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:15,771
That felt like 25.
Gotta be able to do a .45 in 25.

1158
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:16,939
Did you time me?

1159
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:19,191
I did not and I'm calling Albany.

1160
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:30,410
That was stupid.

1161
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:33,205
Was it?

1162
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:36,792
You're stuck with me, Charlie.

1163
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:39,836
No, I'm not. I'm outta here!

1164
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:41,505
Where you going, New Hampshire?

1165
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:44,257
You got no money. How you gonna do that?

1166
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:47,260
Mmm.

1167
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:50,681
Karen's number tastes like Albany.

1168
01:11:51,975 --> 01:11:53,183
Hah!

1169
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:55,435
Fine. I'm leaving.

1170
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,896
Charlie. Charlie!

1171
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:14,246
All I want from you is another day.

1172
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:17,165
For what?

1173
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:22,713
One last tour of the battlefield.

1174
01:12:26,426 --> 01:12:29,094
I can get around a city like New York,

1175
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:31,805
but I

1176
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:34,891
sometimes need a point
in the right direction.

1177
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:39,855
What do you say, Charles?

1178
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:42,899
What's one day between friends?

1179
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,781
All right. Say I stay for another day.

1180
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,784
Will you give me your weapon?

1181
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,077
Oh, Charlie,

1182
01:12:54,162 --> 01:12:56,496
I'm a lieutenant colonel, United States Army.

1183
01:12:56,581 --> 01:12:59,082
I'm not giving my fucking gun to anyone.

1184
01:12:59,167 --> 01:13:01,543
Now, what are you drinkin'?

1185
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:04,004
Colonel, this is unacceptable.

1186
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:07,090
Unacceptable? What are you givin' me
that prep school crap for?

1187
01:13:07,175 --> 01:13:08,550
Unacceptable?

1188
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:12,262
What have they done,
taken the Oregon out of the boy?

1189
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,723
Put in Harvard Business School?

1190
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:17,309
Then give me your bullets.

1191
01:13:23,483 --> 01:13:26,693
You do see the sense of it, Charlie,
don't you?

1192
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:31,990
I can't chew the leather anymore.

1193
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:37,412
So, why should I share
the tribe's provisions?

1194
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:41,958
I mean, there's no one

1195
01:13:42,627 --> 01:13:45,337
wants to tear a herring with me anymore.

1196
01:13:48,049 --> 01:13:49,633
The bullets, Colonel.

1197
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:51,218
"The bullets, Colonel."

1198
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:54,679
You sound like a guy in
Lives of a Bengal Lancer.

1199
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:16,034
What do you give a shit for?

1200
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:20,330
About what?

1201
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:23,667
About whether I blow my brains out or not.

1202
01:14:29,841 --> 01:14:31,591
Because l have a conscience.

1203
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:33,385
You have a conscience.

1204
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:35,971
l forgot.

1205
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,349
The Charlie Conscience.

1206
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:43,812
Do we tell? Do we not tell?

1207
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:48,233
Do we follow the rich boy's code or not?

1208
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:51,403
Do we let this blind asshole

1209
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,406
die or not?

1210
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:56,241
Yeah.

1211
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:58,493
Conscience, Charlie.

1212
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:01,371
When were you born, son?

1213
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:03,748
Around the time of the Round Table?

1214
01:15:05,376 --> 01:15:07,002
Haven't you heard?

1215
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:10,297
Conscience is dead.

1216
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:12,924
No, I haven't heard.

1217
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:16,720
Then take the fucking wax outta your ears!

1218
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:21,057
Grow up!

1219
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:33,945
It's fuck your buddy.

1220
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:37,115
Cheat on your wife.

1221
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,954
Call your mother on Mother's Day.

1222
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:46,416
Charlie,

1223
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:49,461
it's all shit.

1224
01:16:01,015 --> 01:16:02,599
Where you goin'?

1225
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:05,185
I got piss call.

1226
01:16:06,854 --> 01:16:09,898
I know I said I need ya forjust one day

1227
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:12,484
but even l can't hold it that long.

1228
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:16,404
Oh, and Charlie,

1229
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:20,492
you forgot the one in the chamber.

1230
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:26,665
Hah!

1231
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,043
There you go, sir.

1232
01:16:30,795 --> 01:16:32,045
Thank you.

1233
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,384
Twenty-six years in the service,

1234
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:40,345
never let an aide shine my shoes.

1235
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:43,807
Where you gonna be in 26 years, Charlie?

1236
01:16:44,392 --> 01:16:48,186
Playing golf with your friends
from the Baird School, l bet.

1237
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:53,525
l don't even like those guys.

1238
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:56,444
Of course you don't. They're all assholes.

1239
01:16:57,655 --> 01:17:00,365
Be a pleasure to squeal on 'em, wouldn't it?

1240
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:02,784
Yeah, well, I'm not a squealer.

1241
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:04,327
"I'm not a squealer."

1242
01:17:04,412 --> 01:17:06,621
What is this, the Dreyfus case?

1243
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:13,211
Ooh. Ooh, mama!

1244
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:15,130
There you go.

1245
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:16,631
Thank you.

1246
01:17:16,716 --> 01:17:18,383
Thank you.

1247
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:20,760
Watch your step.

1248
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:26,349
I'm gettin' that heavy feelin' again, Charlie.

1249
01:17:29,729 --> 01:17:31,896
There's more to this, isn't there?

1250
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:34,733
Isn't there?

1251
01:17:38,029 --> 01:17:39,904
I was offered a bribe.

1252
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:42,115
Now we're cookin'.

1253
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:45,744
Mr. Trask, the headmaster,

1254
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:49,998
he promised to get me into Harvard.

1255
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,583
If you squeal.

1256
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:53,293
Yeah.

1257
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:55,170
What a dilemma.

1258
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:59,090
Should Charlie Simms accept a free ride
into Harvard, or not?

1259
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:05,180
What do you think your friend George
would do if he were in your shoes?

1260
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:06,681
He is, practically.

1261
01:18:06,766 --> 01:18:08,141
How?

1262
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:12,479
It's just that Mr. Trask hasn't promised
to get him into Harvard.

1263
01:18:12,563 --> 01:18:14,314
Mr. Trask doesn't have to.

1264
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:16,775
George's father's gonna take care of that.

1265
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:21,071
Do the deal, Charlie. Take it!

1266
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,114
Go to Harvard.

1267
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:25,367
I can't do that.

1268
01:18:25,451 --> 01:18:26,618
Why not?

1269
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:31,790
There are just some things you can't do.

1270
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,292
Explain 'em to me.

1271
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:37,212
Louder, please.

1272
01:18:37,296 --> 01:18:38,630
I can't...

1273
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,219
You're gonna have a tough time
in this world, Charlie.

1274
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:48,807
To ease the blow,
let me buy you a drink. Come on.

1275
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:52,685
Double Jack Daniels on the rocks.

1276
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:55,980
And bring my young friend here
a Shirley Temple.

1277
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:58,817
Hold on. Do you have beer?

1278
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:01,528
Certainly. May I see some ID?

1279
01:19:01,612 --> 01:19:04,823
Are you interested in walkin'
the rest of your life, chappy?

1280
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:06,074
I'm sorry, sir, but...

1281
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:09,244
I'm a regular here. My boy's going on 23.

1282
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:12,372
Why don't you call up front, the office?

1283
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:15,250
Mr. Gilbert, he's a friend of mine.

1284
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:19,295
Any particular beer?

1285
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:22,173
Schlitz. No Schlitz?

1286
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:25,009
Blatz. No Blatz?

1287
01:19:26,137 --> 01:19:27,387
Improvise.

1288
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:29,973
I'll do my best, sir.

1289
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:31,933
Thank you, sir.

1290
01:19:32,726 --> 01:19:35,395
You're human, Charlie. Beer?

1291
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:40,900
Who are we drinking with?

1292
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:44,654
I'm getting a nice soap-and-water feeling
from down there.

1293
01:19:52,746 --> 01:19:54,539
A female.

1294
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:56,374
"Female"?

1295
01:19:57,001 --> 01:20:00,670
You callin' her female must mean
you like her or you wouldn't be so casual.

1296
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:05,550
Is she alone?

1297
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:07,010
Yeah, she's alone.

1298
01:20:09,096 --> 01:20:10,763
Things are heatin' up.

1299
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:12,932
Chestnut hair?

1300
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:15,727
Brown, light brown.

1301
01:20:17,897 --> 01:20:19,314
Twenty-two?

1302
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:24,068
What am I, a guy at a carnival?

1303
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:27,489
The day we stop lookin', Charlie,
is the day we die.

1304
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:29,616
Move.

1305
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:31,826
-Where?
-You know where, son.

1306
01:20:31,911 --> 01:20:33,745
Don't be coy, Charlie.

1307
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:38,708
This woman is made for you. I can feel it.

1308
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:41,461
Goddamn beautiful, isn't she?

1309
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:44,589
-She's not bad.
-Bingo! The boy's alive.

1310
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:48,593
Come on, son, perambulate.

1311
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:51,137
Perambulate.

1312
01:21:00,731 --> 01:21:04,150
Excuse me, señorita,
do you mind if we join you?

1313
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:08,655
I'm feelin' you're being neglected.

1314
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:11,616
I'm expecting somebody.

1315
01:21:13,661 --> 01:21:15,036
Instantly?

1316
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:18,206
No, but any minute now.

1317
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:19,541
Any minute?

1318
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:22,418
Some people live a lifetime in a minute.

1319
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:25,672
What are you doin' right now?

1320
01:21:25,965 --> 01:21:28,049
I'm waiting for him.

1321
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:31,261
Would you mind if we waited with you,

1322
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:35,515
just to keep the womanizers
from bothering you?

1323
01:21:39,311 --> 01:21:40,979
No, I don't mind.

1324
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:42,814
Thank you.

1325
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:47,485
Charlie.

1326
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:54,409
You know, I detect a fragrance in the air.

1327
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:56,494
Don't tell me what it is.

1328
01:21:57,496 --> 01:21:59,372
Ogilvie Sisters soap.

1329
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:02,750
That's amazing.

1330
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:04,919
I'm in the amazing business.

1331
01:22:05,004 --> 01:22:07,005
It is Ogilvie Sisters soap.

1332
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:09,882
My grandmother gave me
three bars for Christmas.

1333
01:22:09,967 --> 01:22:12,093
Oh! I'm crazy about your grandmother.

1334
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:14,762
I think she'd have liked Charlie, too.

1335
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:16,973
Don't pay any attention to him.

1336
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:18,474
What's your name?

1337
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:19,767
Donna.

1338
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:22,937
Donna? I'm Frank. This here is...

1339
01:22:23,022 --> 01:22:24,272
Charlie.

1340
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,190
Yes. She likes you.

1341
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:29,193
Charlie's having a difficult weekend.

1342
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:30,737
He's going through a crisis.

1343
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:33,615
How does he look like he's holding up?

1344
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:35,575
He looks fine to me.

1345
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:37,660
Oh! She does like you, Charlie.

1346
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:45,001
So, Donna,

1347
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:49,422
do you tango?

1348
01:22:50,049 --> 01:22:52,717
No. I wanted to learn once, but...

1349
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:54,385
But?

1350
01:22:56,055 --> 01:22:57,805
But Michael didn't want to.

1351
01:22:57,890 --> 01:22:59,098
Michael.

1352
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,477
The one you're waiting for.

1353
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:05,229
Michael thinks the tango's hysterical.

1354
01:23:05,648 --> 01:23:07,732
I think Michael's hysterical.

1355
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:10,318
Don't pay any attention to him.

1356
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:11,527
Did I already say that?

1357
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:16,324
What a beautiful laugh.

1358
01:23:18,077 --> 01:23:19,702
Thank you, Frank.

1359
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:28,086
Would you like to learn to tango, Donna?

1360
01:23:30,923 --> 01:23:32,256
Right now?

1361
01:23:33,676 --> 01:23:37,261
I'm offering you my services, free of charge.

1362
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:38,888
What do you say?

1363
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:44,352
I think I'd be a little afraid.

1364
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:46,979
Of what?

1365
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:50,024
Afraid of making a mistake.

1366
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:55,238
No mistakes in the tango, Donna.
Not like life.

1367
01:23:55,322 --> 01:23:58,116
It's simple.
That's what makes the tango so great.

1368
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:01,661
If you make a mistake,
get all tangled up, just tango on.

1369
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:06,624
Why don't you try?

1370
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:12,588
Will you try it?

1371
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:16,676
All right. I'll give it a try.

1372
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:19,637
Hold me down, son.

1373
01:24:26,228 --> 01:24:27,562
Your arm?

1374
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:31,816
Charlie,

1375
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:35,737
I'm gonna need some coordinates here, son.

1376
01:24:35,821 --> 01:24:38,740
The floor's about 20 by 30,

1377
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:40,992
and you're at the long end.

1378
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:45,830
There's some tables on the outside
and the band's on the right.

1379
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:29,952
Oh, Frank, you are one incredible dancer.

1380
01:27:32,789 --> 01:27:35,082
Wait'll you see Charlie dance.

1381
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:37,627
He's a liar. I don't dance.

1382
01:27:37,711 --> 01:27:39,170
Isn't he a charmer, though?

1383
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:43,257
Truth is, not only can he dance,
but he'll sing you a hell of a tune.

1384
01:27:43,342 --> 01:27:46,010
He can do bird calls
and imitate Bela Lugosi.

1385
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:47,136
Hi, honey.

1386
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:48,304
-Hi.
-Hey.

1387
01:27:48,847 --> 01:27:51,557
Michael, this is Frank and this is Charlie.

1388
01:27:51,642 --> 01:27:53,768
Hi, Frank, Charlie. Sorry I'm late.

1389
01:27:53,852 --> 01:27:55,269
Oh, that's okay.

1390
01:27:55,687 --> 01:27:58,230
These two gentlemen entertained me,

1391
01:27:58,315 --> 01:27:59,899
and time flew.

1392
01:28:00,067 --> 01:28:02,860
Your girl is a hell of a tango dancer.

1393
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:06,280
At last, you found someone to tango with.

1394
01:28:06,365 --> 01:28:07,740
That's terrific!

1395
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:09,367
Let me shake your hand.

1396
01:28:09,451 --> 01:28:11,202
No, it was Frank.

1397
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:13,412
Hell, I'll shake both your hands!

1398
01:28:14,581 --> 01:28:17,541
This looks like the place, but we gotta go.

1399
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:21,337
We got a date with Darryl and Carol
in the Village.

1400
01:28:21,421 --> 01:28:23,839
-Do you have a check?
-Michael, please.

1401
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:25,508
My pleasure.

1402
01:28:25,592 --> 01:28:26,801
Oh, no, no. I got this.

1403
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:28,761
Michael, get your hand outta your pocket.

1404
01:28:28,845 --> 01:28:30,554
I'll take it. Really.

1405
01:28:31,181 --> 01:28:32,556
Allow me.

1406
01:28:34,977 --> 01:28:36,435
Why, thank you.

1407
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:38,020
Bye, guys.

1408
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:39,563
Bye.

1409
01:28:47,781 --> 01:28:50,741
Darryl and Carol. Yeah.

1410
01:28:59,543 --> 01:29:01,335
It's apartment 17E, Colonel.

1411
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:02,962
She's expecting you.

1412
01:29:03,046 --> 01:29:06,882
Don't worry about a thing.
She's the crème de la crème.

1413
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:09,468
My buddy took
the Vice Chancellor of Germany to her.

1414
01:29:09,553 --> 01:29:11,846
Now he wants to immigrate to this country.

1415
01:29:12,097 --> 01:29:14,223
You did good, hombre.

1416
01:29:16,435 --> 01:29:18,269
My hair, how is it?

1417
01:29:19,396 --> 01:29:20,813
It's perfect.

1418
01:29:24,234 --> 01:29:26,193
I got the red foulard okay, didn't I?

1419
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:28,362
Yeah, real dark red.

1420
01:29:28,447 --> 01:29:31,490
Burgundy, Charlie. Burgundy. They love it.

1421
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:35,161
Bay rum.

1422
01:29:37,456 --> 01:29:38,914
Windsor knot.

1423
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:43,919
That's my heart I'm feelin'.

1424
01:29:53,847 --> 01:29:55,056
I'm off.

1425
01:30:13,492 --> 01:30:14,909
Can you get long distance on this?

1426
01:30:14,993 --> 01:30:16,869
And how. Be my guest.

1427
01:30:27,923 --> 01:30:29,256
Sugarbush Lodge.

1428
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:30,841
Hi. George Willis, please?

1429
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:32,718
One moment, please.

1430
01:30:34,387 --> 01:30:36,388
Hello?
-Harry?

1431
01:30:36,473 --> 01:30:38,599
Chas, how are you?

1432
01:30:38,683 --> 01:30:41,894
You just caught us. We're about to shoot
George over to the airport.

1433
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:44,355
Why is George going to the airport?

1434
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:48,067
Hold on.
Maybe you should talk to the man himself.

1435
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:50,402
Chas.

1436
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:51,529
Yeah. Hi, George.

1437
01:30:51,613 --> 01:30:52,905
You just caught me.

1438
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:55,616
That's what Harry said. Where you goin'?

1439
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:56,909
Home.

1440
01:30:56,993 --> 01:30:58,160
To Boston?

1441
01:30:58,245 --> 01:31:01,038
Catching the puddle-jumper.
Keep your fingers crossed.

1442
01:31:01,123 --> 01:31:03,374
What are you going home for?

1443
01:31:06,253 --> 01:31:10,214
I was thinking. This asshole, Trask?
He's making no sense at all.

1444
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:15,136
Somebody's gotta talk to him.
My father was class of '59.

1445
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:19,098
Your father? I thought we were gonna
keep our parents outta this.

1446
01:31:19,391 --> 01:31:22,143
This guy Trask is out of control, Chas.

1447
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:25,729
Out of control!
Somebody's gotta talk to him.

1448
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:28,607
My father's a major fundraiser, you know.

1449
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:29,817
No, I didn't.

1450
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:30,985
Right.

1451
01:31:31,069 --> 01:31:33,404
Relax. He'll get us off the hook.

1452
01:31:33,613 --> 01:31:35,322
I gotta go. Everything all right?

1453
01:31:35,407 --> 01:31:36,574
Sure.

1454
01:31:36,783 --> 01:31:38,868
I'II see you Monday. Goodbye.

1455
01:31:39,161 --> 01:31:40,244
Bye.

1456
01:32:04,978 --> 01:32:07,021
-Good night, sir.
-Good night.

1457
01:32:19,409 --> 01:32:20,409
Hiya, Charlie.

1458
01:32:22,746 --> 01:32:24,246
Watch the door.

1459
01:32:42,849 --> 01:32:44,975
What a beautiful woman.

1460
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:00,824
Hello, there.

1461
01:33:00,909 --> 01:33:02,743
Do you see what l see?

1462
01:33:02,827 --> 01:33:05,579
Yeah.
Either there's something wrong,

1463
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:07,998
or we got the world's worst hangover.

1464
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:10,084
Won't you come in?

1465
01:33:10,168 --> 01:33:12,419
We hear you got a picture
of the bank robbery.

1466
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:31,897
Colonel?

1467
01:33:46,288 --> 01:33:48,205
Colonel, you all right?

1468
01:33:49,916 --> 01:33:51,375
What is it?

1469
01:33:54,754 --> 01:33:56,380
It's after noon.

1470
01:33:57,007 --> 01:33:59,300
You've been sleeping all morning.

1471
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:01,760
So what?

1472
01:34:04,264 --> 01:34:06,098
I don't know. I thought...

1473
01:34:11,021 --> 01:34:13,022
I talked to George last night.

1474
01:34:15,358 --> 01:34:19,361
His father's a big-deal alumnus at school.
He's got a lot of pull.

1475
01:34:20,989 --> 01:34:22,323
Really?

1476
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:28,245
Yeah, he's gonna talk to the headmaster.

1477
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:33,208
George thinks he might be able
to get us off the hook.

1478
01:34:33,293 --> 01:34:35,210
"Get us off the hook."

1479
01:34:35,962 --> 01:34:37,963
Yeah, that's what he said.

1480
01:34:39,758 --> 01:34:41,633
Watch the "us" part.

1481
01:34:44,763 --> 01:34:48,015
Colonel, don't you wanna
get up and do something?

1482
01:34:52,145 --> 01:34:53,395
Colonel?

1483
01:34:54,314 --> 01:34:56,357
Oh, Charlie, what do you want?

1484
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:59,360
I don't know,

1485
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:01,612
but you're making me nervous.

1486
01:35:04,491 --> 01:35:06,742
My wallet is on the dresser.

1487
01:35:08,411 --> 01:35:10,454
Take out your plane ticket

1488
01:35:11,331 --> 01:35:15,584
and $400 mustering-out pay, plus

1489
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:20,464
airport-to-school taxi.

1490
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:26,136
Colonel, it's no rush. I mean, I can...

1491
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:28,680
I could stay for a while.

1492
01:35:28,765 --> 01:35:31,058
Charlie, you already gave me a day.

1493
01:35:32,602 --> 01:35:35,646
And for that day, I am eternally grateful.

1494
01:35:38,316 --> 01:35:42,194
But right now I have other plans.

1495
01:35:43,822 --> 01:35:46,073
What other plans do you have?

1496
01:35:48,118 --> 01:35:49,618
To die, son.

1497
01:35:51,621 --> 01:35:53,330
Colonel, you're...

1498
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:57,000
Come on, Colonel,
you're not gonna die today.

1499
01:35:57,544 --> 01:35:59,795
Charlie, give me your hand.

1500
01:36:04,467 --> 01:36:06,343
You go now, boy. Okay?

1501
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:10,764
You go. Just...

1502
01:36:14,519 --> 01:36:16,645
Just leave me sleep here.

1503
01:36:18,148 --> 01:36:21,066
Look... Can we start over, please?

1504
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:24,736
What do you feel like doin' today, huh?

1505
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:27,948
Look at this. The sun is shining!

1506
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:30,200
It's a beautiful day. Let's...

1507
01:36:34,372 --> 01:36:37,458
Colonel, I know
you don't want to be a party poop,

1508
01:36:37,542 --> 01:36:39,334
so let's go out and do something.

1509
01:36:39,419 --> 01:36:41,211
Let's go for a ride.

1510
01:36:46,718 --> 01:36:48,218
Yeah, a ride.

1511
01:36:50,597 --> 01:36:52,389
A ride?

1512
01:36:53,725 --> 01:36:55,976
Yeah, Colonel Slade, what do you say?

1513
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:57,895
Let's go for a ride, huh?

1514
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:07,529
What kind of ride?

1515
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:12,493
Yeah, this is a valid Oregon driver's license,

1516
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:16,288
and we let appropriate customers
test-drive the Testarossa.

1517
01:37:16,372 --> 01:37:20,250
But you're 17, with a blind companion.
That we don't do.

1518
01:37:20,335 --> 01:37:22,503
This is a $190,000 piece of machinery.

1519
01:37:22,587 --> 01:37:25,005
I'm not letting it out this door.

1520
01:37:25,089 --> 01:37:26,548
How about this one over here?

1521
01:37:26,633 --> 01:37:29,176
That's a Cabriolet T. The same deal.

1522
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:33,639
You think I'll let an unaccompanied kid
get in a $110,000 car?

1523
01:37:33,723 --> 01:37:35,933
He will not be unaccompanied.

1524
01:37:36,809 --> 01:37:39,436
I'll be with him. I'm his father.

1525
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:41,730
You're his father?

1526
01:37:41,814 --> 01:37:43,023
Yes.

1527
01:37:43,441 --> 01:37:46,443
I have an idea.
Why don't I take your father for a test drive?

1528
01:37:46,528 --> 01:37:48,403
What's your quota, Freddie?

1529
01:37:48,488 --> 01:37:50,405
Don't worry about my quota. I do well.

1530
01:37:50,490 --> 01:37:52,449
How many Ferraris you sold this month?

1531
01:37:52,534 --> 01:37:54,326
That's not relevant to this discussion.

1532
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:56,537
Freddie, the '80s are over.

1533
01:37:57,372 --> 01:38:00,123
Are you tryin' to tell me
these things are walkin' outta the store?

1534
01:38:00,208 --> 01:38:04,336
This is a Ferrari, sir, the finest machinery
made in the automobile industry.

1535
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:07,673
If you like it that much, why don't you
sleep with it? Why are you sellin' it?

1536
01:38:07,757 --> 01:38:09,174
I'd love to accommodate you...

1537
01:38:09,259 --> 01:38:12,261
If this car performs the way I expect it to,

1538
01:38:12,345 --> 01:38:15,973
you will get a check of $101,000,
and change,

1539
01:38:16,057 --> 01:38:18,058
when you come in here tomorrow morning.

1540
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:22,062
It's $109,000, plus $950, plus tax.

1541
01:38:22,146 --> 01:38:24,898
Freddie, for you

1542
01:38:24,983 --> 01:38:27,651
107 all in,

1543
01:38:27,735 --> 01:38:31,321
plus a case of champagne
to go with your leftover turkey.

1544
01:38:32,574 --> 01:38:35,284
What do you say?
Don't worry about the boy.

1545
01:38:35,368 --> 01:38:39,037
He drives so smooth,
you can boil an egg on the engine.

1546
01:38:39,122 --> 01:38:42,332
When we bring the car back,
I'll peel the egg for ya.

1547
01:38:43,334 --> 01:38:46,962
Listen, you made me laugh,
but I can't let the car go out.

1548
01:38:48,923 --> 01:38:50,632
Want a deposit?

1549
01:38:50,717 --> 01:38:53,176
This is not an installment item, sir.

1550
01:38:56,514 --> 01:39:00,142
Freddie, you're no spring chicken.

1551
01:39:02,312 --> 01:39:05,272
You know what they call me
at the home office?

1552
01:39:05,356 --> 01:39:06,440
"The Grey Ghost."

1553
01:39:06,524 --> 01:39:08,817
You know why they still keep me around?

1554
01:39:08,901 --> 01:39:12,279
There's no kid here
that can move a Ferrari like I can.

1555
01:39:12,363 --> 01:39:14,990
I'm known from coast to coast
like butter and toast.

1556
01:39:15,074 --> 01:39:17,451
Ask anybody about Freddie Bisco.

1557
01:39:17,535 --> 01:39:18,952
When I get a Ferrari...

1558
01:39:19,037 --> 01:39:20,621
Out the door!

1559
01:39:22,123 --> 01:39:23,790
You just made me laugh, Freddie.

1560
01:39:23,875 --> 01:39:25,042
Yeah?

1561
01:39:25,793 --> 01:39:27,044
2,000.

1562
01:39:28,379 --> 01:39:31,256
Unless you take it,
you're gonna make me cry.

1563
01:39:34,552 --> 01:39:36,386
I'm a grey ghost, too.

1564
01:39:47,815 --> 01:39:50,901
See? This is fun, isn't it?

1565
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:08,877
Drop her into neutral. Slide her into second.

1566
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:10,837
Pop the clutch.

1567
01:40:48,459 --> 01:40:51,211
Straight. Hold it right like that.

1568
01:40:51,295 --> 01:40:53,422
Feel it? That's straight.

1569
01:40:53,506 --> 01:40:55,757
It's a straight street, so keep it straight.

1570
01:40:58,553 --> 01:40:59,928
Keep it straight.

1571
01:41:00,012 --> 01:41:01,596
No fun just to keep it straight.

1572
01:41:01,681 --> 01:41:04,641
You've got to move a little bit, feel the road.

1573
01:41:05,017 --> 01:41:08,019
Please? Just like this.
All right? There you go.

1574
01:41:08,563 --> 01:41:10,480
Take it nice and easy.

1575
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:12,899
Do you like this?

1576
01:41:16,654 --> 01:41:19,698
Slow it down a little, Colonel.
You're goin' a little fast.

1577
01:41:20,658 --> 01:41:22,951
Colonel, slow it down.

1578
01:41:23,786 --> 01:41:25,829
Something's happened to my foot!

1579
01:41:27,582 --> 01:41:28,749
Slow it down, please.

1580
01:41:28,833 --> 01:41:31,501
Hold on. I think I've got another gear.

1581
01:41:32,378 --> 01:41:33,920
Colonel Slade?

1582
01:41:35,506 --> 01:41:36,715
Hoo-ah!

1583
01:41:37,675 --> 01:41:38,925
Watch out!

1584
01:41:42,847 --> 01:41:44,097
You'll get us killed!

1585
01:41:44,182 --> 01:41:46,516
Don't blame me, Charlie, I can't see!

1586
01:41:49,187 --> 01:41:50,479
Colonel, slow it down!

1587
01:42:01,157 --> 01:42:02,365
Oh, Jesus!

1588
01:42:02,867 --> 01:42:05,619
Now let's see how this baby corners.

1589
01:42:05,703 --> 01:42:06,661
Corners?

1590
01:42:06,746 --> 01:42:08,205
Yeah. Say when.

1591
01:42:08,873 --> 01:42:10,040
Say when what?

1592
01:42:10,124 --> 01:42:11,333
Say when to turn.

1593
01:42:11,417 --> 01:42:13,293
Colonel, you can't turn the car.

1594
01:42:13,377 --> 01:42:15,045
Where's the turn, Charlie?

1595
01:42:15,588 --> 01:42:18,965
3 o'clock? 2 o'clock?
Right oblique? Right face?

1596
01:42:19,050 --> 01:42:20,759
Come on! Talk to me!

1597
01:42:21,803 --> 01:42:23,345
It's left, I guess.

1598
01:42:23,429 --> 01:42:26,097
Left. I knew it. Okay. Now?

1599
01:42:27,725 --> 01:42:29,851
No, no! Not now! Not now!

1600
01:42:31,103 --> 01:42:32,270
Now?

1601
01:42:32,563 --> 01:42:33,814
Colonel, please!

1602
01:42:33,898 --> 01:42:36,107
I'm gonna do it anyway, all right?

1603
01:42:36,192 --> 01:42:38,193
Whether you say so or not, here we go!

1604
01:42:38,277 --> 01:42:40,654
Okay! Wait, wait, wait! Just wait!

1605
01:42:40,738 --> 01:42:42,906
Here I go.

1606
01:42:42,990 --> 01:42:44,825
Wait... Now!

1607
01:42:51,415 --> 01:42:54,251
l did it! Oh, Charlie!

1608
01:42:55,878 --> 01:42:58,713
You're ridin' with one very happy man!

1609
01:43:00,424 --> 01:43:01,716
Turn again!

1610
01:43:01,801 --> 01:43:03,051
Be specific, son.

1611
01:43:03,761 --> 01:43:04,803
Left now!

1612
01:43:04,887 --> 01:43:05,971
Okay.

1613
01:43:11,102 --> 01:43:13,770
I love this! I love it!

1614
01:43:15,314 --> 01:43:17,190
Shall we take it to the max?

1615
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:18,942
Let me out.

1616
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:23,113
Shit! The yellow flag.

1617
01:43:24,073 --> 01:43:27,075
I haven't even opened her up yet.
Which way's the curb?

1618
01:43:27,159 --> 01:43:29,619
Pull over. Slow down! Slow down.

1619
01:43:29,704 --> 01:43:30,829
I'm doin' it.

1620
01:43:30,913 --> 01:43:32,831
Pull over to the curb, here. Slow down.

1621
01:43:32,915 --> 01:43:34,040
Yep. Got it.

1622
01:43:46,888 --> 01:43:49,973
Ooh. Haven't had a ticket in years.

1623
01:43:53,311 --> 01:43:55,020
I'll do the talking.

1624
01:44:00,693 --> 01:44:02,694
License and registration.

1625
01:44:14,916 --> 01:44:16,917
Are you test-driving this baby?

1626
01:44:17,001 --> 01:44:18,877
Don't she purr, though?

1627
01:44:19,462 --> 01:44:21,212
At 70 miles an hour?

1628
01:44:21,297 --> 01:44:23,673
You should hear her at 125.

1629
01:44:25,551 --> 01:44:27,385
Where's your license?

1630
01:44:28,971 --> 01:44:30,555
At the dealer's.

1631
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:33,308
They give it back when you return the car.

1632
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:35,727
You got ID?

1633
01:44:35,811 --> 01:44:37,354
You bet.

1634
01:44:38,606 --> 01:44:39,981
Indeed.

1635
01:44:43,903 --> 01:44:45,862
Lieutenant Colonel Slade.

1636
01:44:46,489 --> 01:44:48,156
And you, soldier?

1637
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:51,493
The name is Police Officer Gore.

1638
01:44:53,329 --> 01:44:55,330
Doin' a hell of a job, Gore.

1639
01:44:55,414 --> 01:44:57,457
And so are you, Colonel.

1640
01:44:58,584 --> 01:45:00,085
Who's the kid?

1641
01:45:01,170 --> 01:45:02,963
My boy Charlie.

1642
01:45:03,047 --> 01:45:05,006
He kept tellin' me to "let her out."

1643
01:45:05,091 --> 01:45:07,342
What was I gonna do, disappoint him?

1644
01:45:07,885 --> 01:45:09,052
Yes.

1645
01:45:12,932 --> 01:45:14,933
Tell you what I'm gonna do, Colonel.

1646
01:45:15,017 --> 01:45:17,811
I'm gonna let you go, on one condition.

1647
01:45:17,895 --> 01:45:19,354
What's that?

1648
01:45:19,647 --> 01:45:22,399
That you take this rig
straight back to the dealer.

1649
01:45:24,694 --> 01:45:26,027
You got it.

1650
01:45:26,112 --> 01:45:27,404
Shut up.

1651
01:45:28,197 --> 01:45:29,572
You want this?

1652
01:45:29,907 --> 01:45:31,241
Sure.

1653
01:45:32,243 --> 01:45:33,785
Gore?

1654
01:45:34,245 --> 01:45:36,997
Your face and your voice are familiar.

1655
01:45:37,081 --> 01:45:39,833
You ever been in
the officer's club at Da Nang?

1656
01:45:40,751 --> 01:45:42,002
No.

1657
01:45:42,086 --> 01:45:43,753
Never in the Army?

1658
01:45:44,922 --> 01:45:46,548
No. Coast Guard.

1659
01:45:47,174 --> 01:45:48,717
Good Lord.

1660
01:45:54,098 --> 01:45:56,433
Your dad is looking good, Charlie.

1661
01:45:56,517 --> 01:46:00,061
He's got a heavy foot, though.
Tell him to take it light, all right?

1662
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:03,273
-I hear ya!
-All right.

1663
01:46:03,357 --> 01:46:04,566
Thanks.

1664
01:46:17,538 --> 01:46:20,623
Get out of the car,
because you are not driving anymore.

1665
01:46:20,708 --> 01:46:23,543
Just keeping this baby warm, that's all.

1666
01:46:25,379 --> 01:46:27,464
I'm not drivin' anymore.

1667
01:46:31,927 --> 01:46:33,136
Yes.

1668
01:46:38,476 --> 01:46:40,310
-Take my arm.
-I'm okay.

1669
01:46:40,770 --> 01:46:43,146
Colonel, it's really bumpy here.

1670
01:46:57,161 --> 01:46:58,745
You all right?

1671
01:47:02,166 --> 01:47:03,208
Yeah.

1672
01:47:11,383 --> 01:47:13,343
Red light. Hold it.

1673
01:47:19,767 --> 01:47:21,351
Taking too long.

1674
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:27,941
Shit! Colonel! Colonel!

1675
01:47:38,494 --> 01:47:39,744
Colonel!

1676
01:47:40,412 --> 01:47:42,205
Shit! You all right?

1677
01:47:43,249 --> 01:47:45,333
What the hell are you doing?

1678
01:47:45,417 --> 01:47:46,543
Take the cane.

1679
01:47:46,627 --> 01:47:47,627
I gotta take a piss.

1680
01:47:47,711 --> 01:47:48,878
Take the cane.

1681
01:47:48,963 --> 01:47:50,296
Happens to the best of us.

1682
01:47:50,381 --> 01:47:52,340
We're on Park Avenue. You can't.

1683
01:47:52,424 --> 01:47:53,925
Perfect place.

1684
01:47:54,426 --> 01:47:56,094
You'll get arrested.

1685
01:47:56,178 --> 01:47:58,012
Never been housebroken. (EXCLAlMS)

1686
01:47:58,097 --> 01:47:59,639
Colonel! Shit!

1687
01:48:00,724 --> 01:48:03,309
What's the matter with you, Colonel?

1688
01:48:09,525 --> 01:48:12,944
What are you doing? Stand up.

1689
01:48:14,405 --> 01:48:15,613
Come on.

1690
01:48:15,698 --> 01:48:18,366
I'm tired, Charlie. I'm tired.

1691
01:48:20,452 --> 01:48:22,120
Give me your arm.

1692
01:48:22,746 --> 01:48:24,414
Here's your cane.

1693
01:48:25,749 --> 01:48:27,750
Take me back to the hotel, son.

1694
01:48:33,966 --> 01:48:35,800
Home at last.

1695
01:48:57,114 --> 01:48:58,907
You all right now?

1696
01:49:00,784 --> 01:49:01,910
Yeah.

1697
01:49:05,873 --> 01:49:07,957
Do you want to use the bathroom?

1698
01:49:08,042 --> 01:49:09,125
No.

1699
01:49:18,302 --> 01:49:19,677
Can l get you something?

1700
01:49:19,762 --> 01:49:20,887
No.

1701
01:49:25,059 --> 01:49:26,142
You sure you're all right?

1702
01:49:26,227 --> 01:49:27,894
I'm fine, Charlie.

1703
01:49:46,789 --> 01:49:49,165
Do you mind if I use the phone?

1704
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:50,500
Go ahead.

1705
01:50:09,687 --> 01:50:10,937
Hello?

1706
01:50:11,021 --> 01:50:12,814
Hi, is George there, please?

1707
01:50:12,898 --> 01:50:14,565
Senior or Junior?

1708
01:50:16,068 --> 01:50:17,360
Junior.

1709
01:50:17,444 --> 01:50:18,945
Who's this?

1710
01:50:19,029 --> 01:50:20,488
A friend of his from school.

1711
01:50:20,572 --> 01:50:24,701
Sorry, but George isn't going to be taIking
to any friends from school right now.

1712
01:50:27,037 --> 01:50:28,162
Oh.

1713
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:29,539
Goodbye.

1714
01:50:46,974 --> 01:50:49,350
Colonel, are you looking at me?

1715
01:50:52,062 --> 01:50:53,813
I'm blind, Charlie.

1716
01:51:00,112 --> 01:51:01,946
I'm gonna take a nap.

1717
01:51:04,742 --> 01:51:06,576
Too much fresh air.

1718
01:51:08,412 --> 01:51:10,580
It's probably a good idea.

1719
01:51:11,123 --> 01:51:13,541
Want me to help you to your room?

1720
01:51:14,126 --> 01:51:15,209
No.

1721
01:51:16,545 --> 01:51:17,754
Couch.

1722
01:51:18,922 --> 01:51:20,798
I like this couch here.

1723
01:51:24,094 --> 01:51:26,429
You sure you're all right, Colonel?

1724
01:51:26,513 --> 01:51:28,139
I got a headache.

1725
01:51:34,438 --> 01:51:37,648
Why don't you go downstairs,
get me some aspirin?

1726
01:51:37,733 --> 01:51:40,693
-Some aspirin.
-Yeah. Also...

1727
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:45,281
I feel like a cigar.

1728
01:51:46,825 --> 01:51:50,119
Get me a couple of
Montecristos Number One.

1729
01:51:51,288 --> 01:51:52,705
Montecristos Number One.

1730
01:51:52,790 --> 01:51:53,873
Yeah.

1731
01:51:53,957 --> 01:51:56,751
You won't be able to get 'em
at the newsstand downstairs.

1732
01:51:56,835 --> 01:51:58,878
So why don't you go over to

1733
01:51:59,630 --> 01:52:02,173
50th and Fifth, Dunhill's.

1734
01:52:02,966 --> 01:52:05,760
Fella named Arnold there, in the humidor.

1735
01:52:06,678 --> 01:52:09,305
Tell him they're for me.

1736
01:52:10,682 --> 01:52:11,891
He'll know.

1737
01:53:00,858 --> 01:53:02,984
You're back too fast.

1738
01:53:05,779 --> 01:53:08,114
You didn't get my cigars, did you?

1739
01:53:13,454 --> 01:53:15,371
Get out of here, Charlie.

1740
01:53:19,710 --> 01:53:21,586
I thought we had a deal.

1741
01:53:22,379 --> 01:53:26,340
I welched. I'm a welcher. Didn't I tell you?

1742
01:53:27,885 --> 01:53:31,345
No, what you told me was
that you gave me all the bullets.

1743
01:53:31,722 --> 01:53:32,972
I lied.

1744
01:53:34,892 --> 01:53:36,559
You could have fooled me.

1745
01:53:36,643 --> 01:53:38,019
And I did.

1746
01:53:40,898 --> 01:53:44,233
How you ever gonna survive
in this world without me?

1747
01:53:49,114 --> 01:53:52,158
Why don't you just
give me the gun, all right?

1748
01:54:01,084 --> 01:54:03,294
What are you doing?

1749
01:54:04,630 --> 01:54:06,714
I'm gonna shoot you, too.

1750
01:54:09,801 --> 01:54:11,761
Your life's finished anyway.

1751
01:54:13,013 --> 01:54:15,848
Your friend George
is going to sing like a canary.

1752
01:54:15,933 --> 01:54:17,642
And so are you.

1753
01:54:17,726 --> 01:54:20,269
And once you've sung, Charlie, my boy,

1754
01:54:20,562 --> 01:54:24,690
you're gonna take your place
on that long, gray line

1755
01:54:24,775 --> 01:54:26,609
of American manhood.

1756
01:54:28,237 --> 01:54:30,446
And you will be through.

1757
01:54:32,115 --> 01:54:34,033
I'd like to disagree with you, Colonel.

1758
01:54:34,117 --> 01:54:36,369
You're in no position
to disagree with me, boy.

1759
01:54:36,453 --> 01:54:39,705
I got a loaded .45 here. You got pimples.

1760
01:54:40,707 --> 01:54:42,458
I'm gonna kill ya, Charlie,

1761
01:54:43,168 --> 01:54:46,546
because I can't bear the thought
of you sellin' out!

1762
01:54:48,882 --> 01:54:51,384
Put the gun down, all right, Colonel?

1763
01:54:51,468 --> 01:54:54,595
What? You givin' me an ultimatum?

1764
01:54:54,972 --> 01:54:56,305
No, I'm...

1765
01:54:57,766 --> 01:54:59,684
l give the ultimatums!

1766
01:55:01,478 --> 01:55:02,812
I'm sorry.

1767
01:55:04,731 --> 01:55:06,566
All right? I'm sorry.

1768
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:11,404
It's all right,

1769
01:55:12,656 --> 01:55:14,115
Charlie.

1770
01:55:19,079 --> 01:55:20,997
You break my heart, son.

1771
01:55:22,624 --> 01:55:24,458
All my life l stood up

1772
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:27,461
to everyone and everything,

1773
01:55:28,672 --> 01:55:32,550
because it made me feel important.

1774
01:55:35,012 --> 01:55:37,430
You do it 'cause you mean it.

1775
01:55:40,601 --> 01:55:42,351
You got integrity, Charlie.

1776
01:55:46,565 --> 01:55:49,900
I don't know whether
to shoot you or adopt you.

1777
01:55:52,738 --> 01:55:55,114
Not much of a choice, is it, sir?

1778
01:55:55,198 --> 01:55:57,033
Oh. Don't get cute now.

1779
01:55:57,784 --> 01:55:59,702
Could you please put the gun away?

1780
01:55:59,786 --> 01:56:01,579
I asked you a question.

1781
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:04,999
Do you want me to adopt you, or don't you?

1782
01:56:06,168 --> 01:56:07,793
Please? I mean...

1783
01:56:09,379 --> 01:56:11,714
You're just in a slump right now.

1784
01:56:11,923 --> 01:56:13,049
Slump?

1785
01:56:15,802 --> 01:56:17,553
No slump, Charlie.

1786
01:56:19,890 --> 01:56:21,182
I'm bad.

1787
01:56:24,061 --> 01:56:25,978
I'm not bad. No.

1788
01:56:28,649 --> 01:56:30,149
I'm rotten.

1789
01:56:33,487 --> 01:56:35,071
You're not bad.

1790
01:56:38,408 --> 01:56:40,201
You're just in pain.

1791
01:56:45,874 --> 01:56:48,125
What do you know about pain?

1792
01:56:51,922 --> 01:56:56,217
You little snail darter
from the Pacific Northwest.

1793
01:56:57,386 --> 01:56:59,387
Fuck you know about pain?

1794
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:05,351
Let me have the gun, Colonel.

1795
01:57:05,769 --> 01:57:07,937
No time to grow a dick, son.

1796
01:57:09,147 --> 01:57:11,857
Just give me the gun, all right, Colonel?

1797
01:57:13,777 --> 01:57:15,903
I'm talkin' a parade ground.

1798
01:57:16,113 --> 01:57:17,405
Ten-hut!

1799
01:57:20,283 --> 01:57:23,494
Soldier, that was a direct order.

1800
01:57:25,372 --> 01:57:26,997
Give me the gun.

1801
01:57:30,794 --> 01:57:33,462
You can stay or you can leave.

1802
01:57:34,631 --> 01:57:36,382
You understand?

1803
01:57:36,466 --> 01:57:39,468
Either way, I'm gonna do this thing.

1804
01:57:42,097 --> 01:57:45,808
Now why don't you leave
and spare yourself?

1805
01:57:48,645 --> 01:57:50,646
I want your gun, Colonel.

1806
01:57:59,614 --> 01:58:01,824
I'm gonna give myself a count.

1807
01:58:07,164 --> 01:58:09,832
You need a count for balance.

1808
01:58:13,128 --> 01:58:14,503
Five...

1809
01:58:15,672 --> 01:58:16,672
Four...

1810
01:58:18,467 --> 01:58:19,884
Three...

1811
01:58:22,179 --> 01:58:23,387
Two...

1812
01:58:26,016 --> 01:58:27,183
One...

1813
01:58:29,311 --> 01:58:30,436
Fuck it.

1814
01:58:38,153 --> 01:58:39,862
Give me! Fuck!

1815
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:44,283
Get out of here!

1816
01:58:44,367 --> 01:58:45,659
I'm stayin' right here!

1817
01:58:45,744 --> 01:58:46,952
Get outta here!

1818
01:58:47,037 --> 01:58:48,370
I'm stayin' right here.

1819
01:58:48,455 --> 01:58:50,122
I'll blow your fuckin' head off!

1820
01:58:50,207 --> 01:58:51,749
Then do it!

1821
01:58:51,833 --> 01:58:54,376
You want to do it? Do it! Let's go.

1822
01:59:00,425 --> 01:59:02,510
Get outta here!

1823
01:59:03,887 --> 01:59:06,222
You fucked up, all right? So what?

1824
01:59:06,306 --> 01:59:08,182
So everybody does it.

1825
01:59:08,809 --> 01:59:10,476
Get on with your life, would ya?

1826
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:11,894
What life?

1827
01:59:12,979 --> 01:59:15,022
I got no life!

1828
01:59:17,150 --> 01:59:19,235
I'm in the dark here!

1829
01:59:20,946 --> 01:59:22,488
You understand?

1830
01:59:23,824 --> 01:59:25,407
I'm in the dark!

1831
01:59:31,081 --> 01:59:32,498
So give up.

1832
01:59:33,333 --> 01:59:36,836
You want to give up, give up.
Because I'm givin' up, too.

1833
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:39,255
You said I'm through.
You're right, I am through.

1834
01:59:39,339 --> 01:59:41,423
We're both through. It's all over.

1835
01:59:42,050 --> 01:59:44,301
So let's get on with it. Let's fuckin' do it.

1836
01:59:44,386 --> 01:59:48,973
Let's fuckin' pull the trigger,
you miserable blind motherfucker.

1837
01:59:57,858 --> 01:59:59,525
Pull the trigger.

1838
02:00:01,570 --> 02:00:03,362
Here we go, Charlie.

1839
02:00:04,739 --> 02:00:06,073
I'm ready.

1840
02:00:13,999 --> 02:00:15,875
You don't want to die.

1841
02:00:18,336 --> 02:00:20,129
And neither do you.

1842
02:00:23,592 --> 02:00:26,260
Give me one reason not to.

1843
02:00:30,724 --> 02:00:31,974
I'll give you two.

1844
02:00:32,392 --> 02:00:37,146
You can dance the tango and drive a Ferrari
better than anyone I've ever seen.

1845
02:00:42,319 --> 02:00:44,778
You never seen anyone do either.

1846
02:00:48,950 --> 02:00:51,076
Give me the gun, Colonel.

1847
02:01:02,005 --> 02:01:04,715
Oh, where do I go from here, Charlie?

1848
02:01:06,217 --> 02:01:08,928
If you're tangled up, just tango on.

1849
02:01:11,640 --> 02:01:13,933
You askin' me to dance, Charlie?

1850
02:01:21,232 --> 02:01:23,943
Did you everhave the feelin'

1851
02:01:24,027 --> 02:01:25,903
That you wanted to go

1852
02:01:27,614 --> 02:01:32,034
And still had the feelin'
that you wanted to stay?

1853
02:01:48,551 --> 02:01:50,636
You like my blues, Charlie?

1854
02:01:54,015 --> 02:01:56,058
Yeah, they're beautiful.

1855
02:01:57,394 --> 02:01:59,019
I wore these

1856
02:02:00,855 --> 02:02:02,731
for Lyndon's inauguration.

1857
02:02:05,235 --> 02:02:09,405
Of course, we weren't the number one ball.

1858
02:02:12,951 --> 02:02:14,952
But he dropped by anyway.

1859
02:02:17,622 --> 02:02:19,915
Will you please give me the gun?

1860
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:25,838
You're askin' an officer

1861
02:02:26,965 --> 02:02:29,550
to surrender his sidearm.

1862
02:02:30,927 --> 02:02:32,886
You don't have to surrender it.

1863
02:02:32,971 --> 02:02:35,347
Just put it down for a little while.

1864
02:02:36,224 --> 02:02:38,392
All right? Just put it down.

1865
02:02:50,113 --> 02:02:52,614
Boy, I could use a drink, Charlie.

1866
02:02:56,119 --> 02:02:58,245
How about a cup of coffee?

1867
02:03:00,832 --> 02:03:04,043
Too big a leap for me right now, Charlie.

1868
02:03:04,127 --> 02:03:05,544
Maybe tomorrow.

1869
02:03:08,465 --> 02:03:12,760
No, a Mr. John Daniels would be preferred.

1870
02:03:15,472 --> 02:03:17,139
No water, Charlie.

1871
02:03:19,809 --> 02:03:21,101
No water.

1872
02:03:21,853 --> 02:03:23,145
Please.

1873
02:03:31,154 --> 02:03:33,155
Here's your drink, Colonel.

1874
02:03:39,829 --> 02:03:41,830
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1875
02:03:42,624 --> 02:03:45,209
What time do you want me
to turn down the bed?

1876
02:03:45,293 --> 02:03:47,252
Maybe later, all right?

1877
02:03:47,337 --> 02:03:49,296
What he means, señorita,

1878
02:03:50,465 --> 02:03:52,341
is come right in.

1879
02:03:55,887 --> 02:03:57,346
Later, please?

1880
02:03:58,431 --> 02:04:00,766
Yes, sir. Good afternoon.

1881
02:04:05,438 --> 02:04:06,939
Nice voice.

1882
02:04:11,236 --> 02:04:13,654
Boy, you have a one-track mind.

1883
02:04:15,615 --> 02:04:18,659
Is there anything else in this world, Charlie?

1884
02:04:19,869 --> 02:04:21,370
Not for you.

1885
02:04:22,455 --> 02:04:25,541
You know what's kept me goin'
all these years?

1886
02:04:26,251 --> 02:04:27,918
The thought

1887
02:04:29,212 --> 02:04:31,672
that one day...

1888
02:04:40,557 --> 02:04:41,890
Never mind.

1889
02:04:43,101 --> 02:04:44,393
The what?

1890
02:04:46,229 --> 02:04:47,604
Silly.

1891
02:04:50,483 --> 02:04:53,277
Just the thought that maybe one day, I'd...

1892
02:04:57,282 --> 02:05:00,200
I could have a woman's arms
wrapped around me,

1893
02:05:02,036 --> 02:05:04,288
and her legs wrapped around me.

1894
02:05:07,083 --> 02:05:08,375
And what?

1895
02:05:13,214 --> 02:05:17,676
That I could wake up in the morning
and she'd still be there.

1896
02:05:19,095 --> 02:05:20,596
Smell of her.

1897
02:05:22,098 --> 02:05:23,807
All funky and warm.

1898
02:05:28,521 --> 02:05:30,439
I finally gave up on it.

1899
02:05:33,693 --> 02:05:36,236
I don't know why you can't have that.

1900
02:05:39,282 --> 02:05:41,742
When we get back to New Hampshire,

1901
02:05:41,826 --> 02:05:44,411
I don't know why you can't find someone.

1902
02:05:44,704 --> 02:05:47,748
You're a good-lookin' guy

1903
02:05:48,291 --> 02:05:50,334
and you're fun to be with

1904
02:05:51,127 --> 02:05:54,087
and you're a great travel companion,

1905
02:05:54,631 --> 02:05:57,257
sensitive, compassionate.

1906
02:06:01,304 --> 02:06:02,471
Charlie,

1907
02:06:03,848 --> 02:06:05,933
are you fuckin' with me?

1908
02:06:09,979 --> 02:06:11,146
Yes.

1909
02:06:15,568 --> 02:06:16,818
Yeah?

1910
02:06:17,612 --> 02:06:19,029
Hey, Manny.

1911
02:06:24,285 --> 02:06:25,535
We missed our plane.

1912
02:06:25,620 --> 02:06:27,663
Your plane, Charlie.

1913
02:06:27,747 --> 02:06:29,539
My ticket was one-way.

1914
02:06:31,542 --> 02:06:33,752
New England Thruway all the way, Colonel?

1915
02:06:33,836 --> 02:06:35,671
All the way, Manolo.

1916
02:06:47,850 --> 02:06:50,852
I'm gettin' that heavy feelin' again, Charlie.

1917
02:06:52,730 --> 02:06:53,897
Uh...

1918
02:06:54,774 --> 02:06:56,024
"Uh..."

1919
02:06:56,901 --> 02:07:00,070
I think you were right
about George and his father.

1920
02:07:00,488 --> 02:07:02,447
I'm sorry to hear that.

1921
02:07:02,532 --> 02:07:07,286
When we get back Mr. Trask is bringing us
up in front of the whole school.

1922
02:07:07,370 --> 02:07:09,621
Puttin' your feet to the fire?

1923
02:07:09,706 --> 02:07:12,541
Special meeting of
the disciplinary committee.

1924
02:07:14,168 --> 02:07:16,545
And what are you gonna tell 'em?

1925
02:07:19,382 --> 02:07:21,925
I don't know. I'll think of somethin'.

1926
02:07:23,845 --> 02:07:27,472
Charlie, why are you all alone in this thing?

1927
02:07:28,391 --> 02:07:29,474
Hmm?

1928
02:07:29,559 --> 02:07:31,310
Where's your father?

1929
02:07:32,895 --> 02:07:34,396
He left.

1930
02:07:35,815 --> 02:07:40,068
I thought it was a mom-and-pop store.
Who's the pop?

1931
02:07:40,570 --> 02:07:42,279
It's my stepfather.

1932
02:07:43,281 --> 02:07:45,157
Oh, yeah.

1933
02:07:47,243 --> 02:07:50,912
But why isn't he in on this?
Somethin' wrong with him?

1934
02:07:52,248 --> 02:07:54,791
No, he's okay. We just...

1935
02:07:55,251 --> 02:07:56,835
We don't get along very well.

1936
02:07:56,919 --> 02:07:58,211
Why not?

1937
02:07:59,922 --> 02:08:01,423
Because he's an asshole.

1938
02:08:06,137 --> 02:08:09,431
Well, that's all right, Charlie.

1939
02:08:11,601 --> 02:08:14,478
Every family's got one nowadays.

1940
02:08:44,384 --> 02:08:45,717
That's it?

1941
02:08:46,052 --> 02:08:47,094
That's it.

1942
02:08:47,178 --> 02:08:48,553
Take care of yourself, kid.

1943
02:08:48,638 --> 02:08:50,514
All right, Manny. Thanks.

1944
02:08:56,354 --> 02:08:58,355
No, I'm not opening.

1945
02:08:59,982 --> 02:09:01,525
I hate goodbyes.

1946
02:09:04,153 --> 02:09:05,695
So...

1947
02:09:06,489 --> 02:09:08,115
You'll be all right, huh?

1948
02:09:09,492 --> 02:09:10,992
I'll be fine.

1949
02:09:12,495 --> 02:09:13,787
All right.

1950
02:09:17,083 --> 02:09:18,667
What's that?

1951
02:09:19,585 --> 02:09:21,336
That's first bell.

1952
02:09:23,005 --> 02:09:25,424
Just got time to get cleaned up.

1953
02:09:27,301 --> 02:09:28,385
Oh.

1954
02:09:28,803 --> 02:09:30,512
I almost forgot.

1955
02:09:34,809 --> 02:09:36,768
I owe you some money.

1956
02:09:39,105 --> 02:09:42,274
$300. Job well done.

1957
02:09:46,487 --> 02:09:49,281
You ever need any references, Charlie,
I'm your man.

1958
02:09:51,409 --> 02:09:53,034
Thanks, Colonel.

1959
02:09:59,834 --> 02:10:02,794
1 6 Water Street. Over the bridge.

1960
02:10:02,879 --> 02:10:04,379
We'll find it.

1961
02:10:05,423 --> 02:10:07,174
Goodbye, Charlie.

1962
02:10:08,885 --> 02:10:10,594
Goodbye, Colonel.

1963
02:10:13,723 --> 02:10:15,348
Come here, son.

1964
02:10:32,074 --> 02:10:33,450
Okay, Manny.

1965
02:11:47,650 --> 02:11:49,651
George. George!

1966
02:12:28,816 --> 02:12:31,568
I called an open meeting
of this institution this morning

1967
02:12:31,652 --> 02:12:34,863
because the incident
that occurred this Tuesday last

1968
02:12:34,947 --> 02:12:39,034
describes an issue that concerns all of us.

1969
02:12:40,494 --> 02:12:42,621
Not an isolated case of vandalism.

1970
02:12:42,705 --> 02:12:47,459
What happened is a symptom
of the sickness of a society.

1971
02:12:48,919 --> 02:12:54,174
A sickness which runs counter to
the principles this school was founded on.

1972
02:12:56,385 --> 02:12:58,678
A school among whose graduates

1973
02:12:58,763 --> 02:13:03,558
two have sat behind the desk
in the Oval Office, in the White House.

1974
02:13:04,644 --> 02:13:07,979
Baird men have run State Departments
and investment houses,

1975
02:13:08,731 --> 02:13:11,816
founded department stores
and coached football teams.

1976
02:13:11,901 --> 02:13:15,362
Our alumni receive their bulletins
in ashrams in India

1977
02:13:15,821 --> 02:13:17,656
and in palaces in Jordan.

1978
02:13:17,740 --> 02:13:20,158
We are, in fact, known around the world

1979
02:13:20,242 --> 02:13:23,328
as the cradle of this country's leadership.

1980
02:13:23,412 --> 02:13:25,330
-A beacon in the...
-What are you doing here?

1981
02:13:25,414 --> 02:13:27,207
Got room for me up there, Charlie?

1982
02:13:27,291 --> 02:13:30,335
But today we are bleeding from disrespect.

1983
02:13:30,419 --> 02:13:31,586
Yeah, I guess so.

1984
02:13:31,671 --> 02:13:33,463
-Blatant disrespect.
-Give us a hand.

1985
02:13:33,547 --> 02:13:35,674
A disrespect for our values,

1986
02:13:35,758 --> 02:13:39,552
and a disrespect for our standards.

1987
02:13:39,637 --> 02:13:43,014
A disrespect for the Baird tradition.

1988
02:13:43,099 --> 02:13:45,892
And, as the custodians of that tradition,

1989
02:13:47,019 --> 02:13:51,231
we are here today to protect each other

1990
02:13:51,774 --> 02:13:54,275
from those who threaten it.

1991
02:13:55,444 --> 02:13:57,404
Who is this, Mr. Simms?

1992
02:13:59,615 --> 02:14:01,533
This is Mr. Frank Slade,

1993
02:14:02,326 --> 02:14:05,578
Lieutenant Colonel,
United States Army, retired.

1994
02:14:06,872 --> 02:14:09,207
I'm here in place of Charlie's parents.

1995
02:14:09,458 --> 02:14:10,792
Excuse me?

1996
02:14:11,085 --> 02:14:12,711
In loco parentis.

1997
02:14:15,047 --> 02:14:18,216
They could not make the trip
from Oregon today.

1998
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:21,261
And what is your reIationship to Mr. Simms?

1999
02:14:21,345 --> 02:14:23,138
Is this a courtroom?

2000
02:14:24,056 --> 02:14:26,015
CIosest thing we couId manage to it.

2001
02:14:26,100 --> 02:14:29,769
Then if we're taking oaths,
there's a few people I'd like to swear in.

2002
02:14:32,106 --> 02:14:34,315
There are no oaths at Baird.

2003
02:14:35,359 --> 02:14:37,360
We are all on our honor.

2004
02:14:39,321 --> 02:14:44,325
Larry and Franny Simms are
very dear, close friends of mine.

2005
02:14:45,077 --> 02:14:48,288
They've asked me to appear here
on Charlie's behalf.

2006
02:14:49,206 --> 02:14:50,415
Okay?

2007
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:55,378
Happy to have you with us, CoIoneI.

2008
02:14:59,633 --> 02:15:00,967
Mr. Willis.

2009
02:15:03,345 --> 02:15:05,013
Which Mr. Willis?

2010
02:15:05,097 --> 02:15:06,514
George, Junior, sir.

2011
02:15:11,562 --> 02:15:13,104
Yes.

2012
02:15:13,189 --> 02:15:17,984
You were in a position last Tuesday night
to see who committed this act of vandalism.

2013
02:15:18,068 --> 02:15:19,486
Who was it?

2014
02:15:21,489 --> 02:15:24,741
Well, I have an idea who it was.

2015
02:15:24,825 --> 02:15:26,367
No, not an idea, Mr. Willis.

2016
02:15:26,452 --> 02:15:28,286
Did you see or did you not see?

2017
02:15:31,290 --> 02:15:32,624
Well...

2018
02:15:34,376 --> 02:15:36,711
I didn't have my contacts in.

2019
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:42,050
Come on.

2020
02:15:45,888 --> 02:15:48,973
I was in the library. I'd taken my glasses off,

2021
02:15:49,058 --> 02:15:51,643
and I was gonna put my contacts back in.

2022
02:15:57,066 --> 02:15:58,775
Then I helped Simms close up

2023
02:15:58,859 --> 02:16:01,778
and the next thing I know, we're outside,

2024
02:16:01,862 --> 02:16:03,905
and I hear this sound and I

2025
02:16:06,075 --> 02:16:08,910
didn't have any time to put my contacts in.

2026
02:16:09,537 --> 02:16:12,247
Whom, with your limited vision,
did you see?

2027
02:16:29,807 --> 02:16:31,933
Like I say, it was blurry.

2028
02:16:37,815 --> 02:16:40,358
I can't see without my contacts.

2029
02:16:40,442 --> 02:16:42,861
What did you see, Mr. Willis?

2030
02:16:43,195 --> 02:16:44,404
What?

2031
02:16:45,447 --> 02:16:46,781
You mean definitively?

2032
02:16:46,866 --> 02:16:48,616
Stop fencing with me, Mr. WiIIis!

2033
02:16:48,701 --> 02:16:50,618
Tell me what you saw!

2034
02:16:55,749 --> 02:16:59,961
Now, don't hold me to this,
but no contacts, it's dark...

2035
02:17:02,464 --> 02:17:03,923
And everything, I mean...

2036
02:17:04,008 --> 02:17:05,425
Mr. Willis!

2037
02:17:08,596 --> 02:17:09,679
Maybe...

2038
02:17:12,141 --> 02:17:14,058
Harry Havemeyer,

2039
02:17:14,852 --> 02:17:17,854
Trent Potter and Jimmy Jameson.

2040
02:17:22,026 --> 02:17:23,151
Maybe?

2041
02:17:23,235 --> 02:17:24,944
Ballpark, best guess.

2042
02:17:27,156 --> 02:17:29,908
CouId you provide us with some detaiI?

2043
02:17:32,494 --> 02:17:35,997
Why don't you ask Charlie?
I really think he was closer.

2044
02:17:44,965 --> 02:17:46,299
Mr. Simms.

2045
02:17:47,384 --> 02:17:49,260
Yes.

2046
02:17:49,345 --> 02:17:52,055
You don't wear contact lenses, do you?

2047
02:17:52,139 --> 02:17:53,431
No, sir.

2048
02:17:55,184 --> 02:17:59,187
With your untrammeled sight,
whom did you see?

2049
02:18:03,567 --> 02:18:05,360
Well, I saw something,

2050
02:18:07,363 --> 02:18:09,822
but I couldn't say who.

2051
02:18:10,532 --> 02:18:13,451
All right. What was the something you saw?

2052
02:18:17,373 --> 02:18:18,373
I couldn't say.

2053
02:18:18,457 --> 02:18:20,208
You couldn't or wouldn't say?

2054
02:18:22,962 --> 02:18:24,504
Well, I just...

2055
02:18:28,467 --> 02:18:29,759
I just couldn't say.

2056
02:18:29,843 --> 02:18:31,427
Couldn't, wouldn't, shouldn't.

2057
02:18:31,512 --> 02:18:34,889
You're exhausting my patience
and making a mockery of these proceedings.

2058
02:18:34,974 --> 02:18:36,641
I will give you one last chance.

2059
02:18:36,725 --> 02:18:39,227
The consequences of your response
will be dire.

2060
02:18:39,311 --> 02:18:43,648
By dire, I mean your future will be
jeopardized permanently.

2061
02:18:45,275 --> 02:18:47,110
Now for the last time,

2062
02:18:47,194 --> 02:18:51,572
what did you see last Tuesday night
outside my office?

2063
02:18:55,744 --> 02:18:57,495
I saw somebody.

2064
02:18:57,579 --> 02:18:59,747
"I saw somebody." Good.

2065
02:19:00,916 --> 02:19:03,292
Did you see their size and shape?

2066
02:19:04,753 --> 02:19:06,087
Yeah.

2067
02:19:06,839 --> 02:19:09,507
And they were the size and shape of whom?

2068
02:19:14,972 --> 02:19:17,056
They were the size and shape

2069
02:19:32,114 --> 02:19:34,282
of most any Baird student, sir.

2070
02:19:49,423 --> 02:19:51,674
I am left with no real witness.

2071
02:19:53,469 --> 02:19:57,346
Mr. Willis' testimony is not only vague,
it is unsubstantiated.

2072
02:19:57,473 --> 02:20:02,101
The substance I was Iooking for, Mr. Simms,
was to come from you.

2073
02:20:05,814 --> 02:20:07,190
I'm sorry.

2074
02:20:08,776 --> 02:20:10,818
I'm sorry, too, Mr. Simms,

2075
02:20:11,695 --> 02:20:13,571
because you know what I'm going to do

2076
02:20:13,655 --> 02:20:18,534
in as much as I can't punish Mr. Havemeyer,
Mr. Potter or Mr. Jameson?

2077
02:20:18,619 --> 02:20:20,661
And I won't punish Mr. Willis.

2078
02:20:21,246 --> 02:20:23,164
He's the only party to this incident

2079
02:20:23,248 --> 02:20:26,209
who is still worthy
of calling himself a Baird man.

2080
02:20:27,503 --> 02:20:30,671
I'm going to recommend to
the disciplinary committee

2081
02:20:32,508 --> 02:20:34,425
that you be expelled.

2082
02:20:34,510 --> 02:20:38,638
Mr. Simms, you are a cover-up artist
and you are a liar.

2083
02:20:38,722 --> 02:20:40,681
But not a snitch!

2084
02:20:42,184 --> 02:20:43,643
Excuse me?

2085
02:20:43,727 --> 02:20:45,311
No, I don't think I will.

2086
02:20:45,395 --> 02:20:46,771
Mr. Slade.

2087
02:20:46,855 --> 02:20:49,315
This is such a crock of shit!

2088
02:20:50,692 --> 02:20:52,860
PIease watch your Ianguage, Mr. SIade.

2089
02:20:52,945 --> 02:20:55,863
You are in the Baird school, not a barracks.

2090
02:20:56,281 --> 02:20:59,158
Mr. Simms, I will give you
one final opportunity to speak up.

2091
02:20:59,243 --> 02:21:01,369
Mr. Simms doesn't want it.

2092
02:21:02,079 --> 02:21:06,165
He doesn't need to be labeled
"still worthy of being a Baird man."

2093
02:21:06,583 --> 02:21:08,501
What the hell is that?

2094
02:21:08,585 --> 02:21:10,628
What is your motto here?

2095
02:21:10,712 --> 02:21:14,799
"Boys, inform on your classmates,
save your hide,

2096
02:21:14,883 --> 02:21:18,261
"anything short of that,
we're gonna burn you at the stake?"

2097
02:21:18,345 --> 02:21:20,513
Well, gentlemen,

2098
02:21:20,597 --> 02:21:23,975
when the shit hits the fan, some guys run,

2099
02:21:24,059 --> 02:21:25,685
and some guys stay.

2100
02:21:25,769 --> 02:21:29,230
Here's Charlie, facin' the fire,
and there's George,

2101
02:21:29,314 --> 02:21:31,816
hidin' in big daddy's pocket.

2102
02:21:31,900 --> 02:21:33,526
And what are you doin'?

2103
02:21:33,610 --> 02:21:37,572
You're gonna reward George
and destroy Charlie.

2104
02:21:39,324 --> 02:21:40,825
Are you finished, Mr. SIade?

2105
02:21:40,909 --> 02:21:43,035
No, I'm just gettin' warmed up.

2106
02:21:44,079 --> 02:21:46,122
l don't know who went to this place.

2107
02:21:46,206 --> 02:21:49,208
William Howard Taft,
William Jennings Bryan,

2108
02:21:49,293 --> 02:21:50,877
William Tell, whoever.

2109
02:21:50,961 --> 02:21:54,255
Their spirit is dead, if they ever had one.

2110
02:21:54,339 --> 02:21:55,673
lt's gone.

2111
02:21:55,757 --> 02:21:58,634
You're buildin' a rat ship here,

2112
02:21:58,719 --> 02:22:01,637
a vessel for seagoin' snitches.

2113
02:22:01,722 --> 02:22:05,474
And if you think you're preparin' these
minnows for manhood,

2114
02:22:05,559 --> 02:22:07,101
you better think again,

2115
02:22:07,186 --> 02:22:12,940
because I say you are killin' the very spirit
this institution proclaims it instills.

2116
02:22:14,193 --> 02:22:15,776
What a sham.

2117
02:22:15,903 --> 02:22:18,821
What kind of a show
are you guys puttin' on here today?

2118
02:22:18,906 --> 02:22:22,366
The only class in this act
is sittin' next to me.

2119
02:22:22,451 --> 02:22:26,162
And I'm here to tell you
this boy's soul is intact.

2120
02:22:26,246 --> 02:22:28,998
It's non-negotiable. You know how I know?

2121
02:22:29,082 --> 02:22:32,752
Someone here, and I won't say who,
offered to buy it.

2122
02:22:33,170 --> 02:22:35,213
Only Charlie here wasn't sellin'.

2123
02:22:35,297 --> 02:22:36,714
Sir, you're out of order.

2124
02:22:36,798 --> 02:22:39,050
I'd show you out of order.

2125
02:22:39,134 --> 02:22:42,136
You don't know what
out of order is, Mr. Trask.

2126
02:22:42,221 --> 02:22:44,388
I'd show you, but I'm too old,

2127
02:22:44,473 --> 02:22:46,974
I'm too tired, I'm too fuckin' blind.

2128
02:22:47,059 --> 02:22:52,480
If I were the man I was five years ago,
I'd take a flamethrower to this place!

2129
02:22:55,609 --> 02:22:58,736
Out of order?
Who the hell you think you're talkin' to?

2130
02:23:00,322 --> 02:23:02,490
I've been around, you know?

2131
02:23:03,158 --> 02:23:05,326
There was a time I could see.

2132
02:23:05,827 --> 02:23:07,411
And I have seen.

2133
02:23:07,996 --> 02:23:10,289
Boys like these, younger than these,

2134
02:23:10,374 --> 02:23:13,709
their arms torn out, their legs ripped off.

2135
02:23:14,294 --> 02:23:19,257
But there is nothin' like the sight
of an amputated spirit.

2136
02:23:19,341 --> 02:23:22,218
There is no prosthetic for that.

2137
02:23:23,971 --> 02:23:27,431
You think you're merely
sendin' this splendid foot soldier

2138
02:23:27,516 --> 02:23:30,726
back home to Oregon
with his tail between his legs,

2139
02:23:30,811 --> 02:23:34,730
but I say you are executin' his soul!

2140
02:23:36,024 --> 02:23:37,358
And why?

2141
02:23:38,277 --> 02:23:40,653
Because he's not a Baird man.

2142
02:23:41,321 --> 02:23:44,156
Baird men. You hurt this boy,

2143
02:23:44,241 --> 02:23:47,034
you're gonna be Baird bums, the lot of you.

2144
02:23:47,202 --> 02:23:49,453
And, Harry, Jimmy,

2145
02:23:50,289 --> 02:23:52,957
Trent, wherever you are out there,

2146
02:23:53,041 --> 02:23:54,625
fuck you, too!

2147
02:23:57,212 --> 02:23:59,130
Stand down, Mr. Slade!

2148
02:23:59,214 --> 02:24:00,715
I'm not finished.

2149
02:24:01,883 --> 02:24:06,137
As I came in here, I heard those words,

2150
02:24:06,221 --> 02:24:08,180
"cradle of leadership."

2151
02:24:09,391 --> 02:24:14,812
Well, "when the bough breaks,
the cradle will fall," and it has fallen here.

2152
02:24:14,896 --> 02:24:16,480
It has fallen.

2153
02:24:16,565 --> 02:24:19,567
Makers of men, creators of leaders.

2154
02:24:19,693 --> 02:24:23,070
Be careful what kind of leaders
you're producin' here.

2155
02:24:24,031 --> 02:24:28,159
I don't know if Charlie's silence
here today is right or wrong.

2156
02:24:28,243 --> 02:24:29,744
I'm not a judge or jury.

2157
02:24:29,828 --> 02:24:31,620
But I can tell you this,

2158
02:24:31,705 --> 02:24:35,458
he won't sell anybody out to buy his future!

2159
02:24:36,752 --> 02:24:39,920
And that, my friends, is called integrity.

2160
02:24:40,881 --> 02:24:42,757
That's called courage.

2161
02:24:42,883 --> 02:24:46,052
Now that's the stuff
leaders should be made of.

2162
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:55,102
Now I have come to
the crossroads in my life.

2163
02:24:56,271 --> 02:24:59,607
I always knew what the right path was.

2164
02:25:00,609 --> 02:25:03,944
Without exception, I knew,
but I never took it.

2165
02:25:04,446 --> 02:25:05,946
You know why?

2166
02:25:06,573 --> 02:25:09,533
It was too damn hard.

2167
02:25:11,161 --> 02:25:14,246
Now here's Charlie.
He's come to the crossroads.

2168
02:25:14,331 --> 02:25:17,792
He has chosen a path. It's the right path.

2169
02:25:18,794 --> 02:25:22,463
It's a path made of principle
that leads to character.

2170
02:25:25,467 --> 02:25:27,885
Let him continue on his journey.

2171
02:25:29,971 --> 02:25:33,474
You hold this boy's future
in your hands, committee.

2172
02:25:34,684 --> 02:25:38,229
It's a valuable future, believe me.

2173
02:25:39,481 --> 02:25:42,149
Don't destroy it. Protect it.

2174
02:25:43,819 --> 02:25:45,236
Embrace it.

2175
02:25:45,987 --> 02:25:49,156
It's gonna make you proud one day,
I promise you.

2176
02:26:06,716 --> 02:26:08,676
How's that for cornball?

2177
02:26:30,198 --> 02:26:32,283
Nothing can shut them up, sir.

2178
02:26:36,788 --> 02:26:39,957
The disciplinary committee will take
this matter under advisement

2179
02:26:40,041 --> 02:26:42,209
in closed session.

2180
02:26:50,218 --> 02:26:52,428
What are they doin', Charlie?

2181
02:26:53,221 --> 02:26:56,390
I think they're going to
come to a decision now.

2182
02:26:59,728 --> 02:27:01,061
Very well.

2183
02:27:06,568 --> 02:27:09,403
Apparently, that meeting
will be unnecessary.

2184
02:27:10,238 --> 02:27:11,739
Mrs. Hunsaker.

2185
02:27:15,911 --> 02:27:21,165
The joint student-faculty disciplinary
committee needs no further sessions.

2186
02:27:21,249 --> 02:27:23,834
They have come to a decision.

2187
02:27:23,919 --> 02:27:28,464
Messrs. Havemeyer, Potter and Jameson
are placed on probation

2188
02:27:29,007 --> 02:27:31,967
for suspicion of ungentlemanly conduct.

2189
02:27:32,260 --> 02:27:35,513
It is further recommended
that Mr. George Willis, Jr.

2190
02:27:35,597 --> 02:27:38,807
receive neither recognition
nor commendation

2191
02:27:38,892 --> 02:27:40,684
for his cooperation.

2192
02:27:42,103 --> 02:27:46,774
Mr. Charles Simms is excused
from any further response to this incident.

2193
02:27:47,192 --> 02:27:48,192
Hoo-ah!

2194
02:28:47,919 --> 02:28:49,128
Last step.

2195
02:28:49,212 --> 02:28:51,505
I can always count on you, Charlie.

2196
02:28:54,676 --> 02:28:56,176
Colonel!

2197
02:28:59,723 --> 02:29:01,557
I'm Christine Downes, Colonel Slade.

2198
02:29:01,641 --> 02:29:03,267
I teach political science.

2199
02:29:03,351 --> 02:29:06,770
I wanted to tell you how much I appreciate
you speaking your mind.

2200
02:29:06,855 --> 02:29:08,689
Why, thank you. Are you married?

2201
02:29:10,025 --> 02:29:11,150
I...

2202
02:29:13,695 --> 02:29:17,239
Went to an artillery school
at Fort Sill with a Mickey Downes.

2203
02:29:17,324 --> 02:29:18,991
Thought he might've snagged you.

2204
02:29:19,075 --> 02:29:21,243
No, I'm afraid not.

2205
02:29:22,912 --> 02:29:26,749
Colonel Slade was on
Lyndon Johnson's staff, Miss Downes.

2206
02:29:26,833 --> 02:29:29,126
Were you? Fascinating.

2207
02:29:29,210 --> 02:29:31,879
We should get together,
talk politics sometime.

2208
02:29:35,800 --> 02:29:37,635
Fleurs de Rocaille.

2209
02:29:39,346 --> 02:29:40,471
Yes.

2210
02:29:42,057 --> 02:29:44,183
"Flowers from a brook."

2211
02:29:45,727 --> 02:29:47,186
That's right.

2212
02:29:50,982 --> 02:29:54,818
Well, Miss Downes,
I'll know where to find you.

2213
02:29:56,988 --> 02:29:58,405
Charlie.

2214
02:29:58,490 --> 02:29:59,823
Bye, Miss Downes.

2215
02:29:59,908 --> 02:30:01,158
Bye.

2216
02:30:04,412 --> 02:30:06,955
You don't have to tell me, Charlie.

2217
02:30:07,540 --> 02:30:08,666
5'7",

2218
02:30:10,251 --> 02:30:12,044
auburn hair,

2219
02:30:13,004 --> 02:30:15,506
beautiful brown eyes.

2220
02:30:34,275 --> 02:30:35,901
Yabba-dabba-doo.

2221
02:30:37,320 --> 02:30:38,445
Ha!

2222
02:30:40,573 --> 02:30:41,740
Manny.

2223
02:30:44,452 --> 02:30:45,911
Oh, Colonel, this is too much.

2224
02:30:45,995 --> 02:30:47,454
Never mind, you earned it.

2225
02:30:47,539 --> 02:30:49,039
Next time Charlie and I

2226
02:30:49,124 --> 02:30:52,126
want to take a breather to New York,
we're gonna call you.

2227
02:30:52,210 --> 02:30:53,877
You can drive us both ways.

2228
02:30:53,962 --> 02:30:55,337
You're on, Colonel.

2229
02:30:55,422 --> 02:30:58,424
Not only will it be an honor,
I'll give you a rate.

2230
02:30:58,508 --> 02:31:01,135
I'll see your rate and raise you.

2231
02:31:01,219 --> 02:31:02,970
Stay outta harm's way, Manny.

2232
02:31:03,054 --> 02:31:04,179
Take care, Colonel.

2233
02:31:04,264 --> 02:31:05,556
You, too.

2234
02:31:06,307 --> 02:31:08,809
-Ready?
-No. I'll take it from here.

2235
02:31:09,894 --> 02:31:11,228
You go on ahead.

2236
02:31:11,312 --> 02:31:13,605
Manny'll drive you to your dorm.

2237
02:31:15,024 --> 02:31:17,651
Come by before you go home for Christmas.

2238
02:31:17,736 --> 02:31:19,903
We'll have a little cheer.

2239
02:31:19,988 --> 02:31:22,489
And if you like, stay for dinner.

2240
02:31:22,574 --> 02:31:25,534
Sometimes she cooks a pot roast.

2241
02:31:25,618 --> 02:31:27,286
It's almost edible.

2242
02:31:28,747 --> 02:31:31,290
All right, Colonel. That'd be really...

2243
02:31:31,374 --> 02:31:32,833
Bye, Charlie.

2244
02:31:52,771 --> 02:31:56,440
Who's there? That you, Francine?

2245
02:31:56,524 --> 02:31:57,483
Yes.

2246
02:31:57,567 --> 02:31:58,776
What are you doing?

2247
02:31:58,860 --> 02:32:00,819
Taking a ride.

2248
02:32:00,904 --> 02:32:02,571
Taking a ride?

2249
02:32:02,655 --> 02:32:04,990
What about you giving me a lift?

2250
02:32:05,074 --> 02:32:06,200
No.

2251
02:32:06,284 --> 02:32:07,409
No?

2252
02:32:07,911 --> 02:32:09,703
Come on, Francine.

2253
02:32:10,205 --> 02:32:13,207
We should make up.
Don't you think it's time we made up?

2254
02:32:13,708 --> 02:32:15,000
No.

2255
02:32:15,084 --> 02:32:16,752
-Francine?
-What?

2256
02:32:16,836 --> 02:32:22,132
Uncle Frank's had
a really hard Thanksgiving weekend.

2257
02:32:23,802 --> 02:32:26,386
What's that? I hear a chipmunk.

2258
02:32:27,013 --> 02:32:28,889
Is it a walrus?

2259
02:32:29,182 --> 02:32:30,766
No, it's Willie.

2260
02:32:31,180 --> 02:32:33,810
Willie, why don't you help me with my bag?

2261
02:32:33,895 --> 02:32:36,400
Come on, son. Help me with my bag.

2262
02:32:36,690 --> 02:32:38,900
Come on. Come on.

2263
02:32:39,360 --> 02:32:42,945
You got it. Hold onto it.
You're strong. Come on.

2264
02:32:45,280 --> 02:32:46,740
Here we are.

2265
02:32:47,950 --> 02:32:50,535
Francine, come on with me and Willie.

2266
02:32:50,745 --> 02:32:53,455
I'll let you make me
some marshmallow chocolate.

2267
02:32:53,540 --> 02:32:55,250
What do you say?

2268
02:32:55,540 --> 02:32:56,540
Good!
