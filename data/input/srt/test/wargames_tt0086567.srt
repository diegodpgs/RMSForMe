1
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:18,875
Replacement team's here, sir.

2
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,083
Right.

3
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:22,250
Come on through.

4
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,417
20 minutes and we were gonna
start looking for you.

5
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah. It's really something out there.

6
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,208
- You look a mess, sir.
- Yeah?

7
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,375
Your turn next, Ginsburg.

8
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:42,167
OK. I'll see you in 24.

9
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,000
See you tomorrow.

10
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:50,792
What was that you were you saying?

11
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:54,583
You used to hear her chant
all night long. Om mahneypod me om.

12
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:57,167
- Om mahneypod me om.
- Over the plants?

13
00:01:57,292 --> 00:02:00,583
She'd cup her hands over those seeds
and chant by the hour.

14
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:03,792
She grew the most beautiful
wandoos you ever saw, man.

15
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:05,958
Primo stuff. Resin city.

16
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,000
Stand clear.

17
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:25,042
The commander's been worried
about you. The roads must be a bear.

18
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:27,375
- What roads?
- Visibility.

19
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,208
Visibility? Bullshit. You guys haven't
been on time for the last six months.

20
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:36,000
- I wrote you guys up in the logbook.
- Yeah. You're a prince, Bevan.

21
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,875
Good night, gentlemen!

22
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:52,792
So, that was like sinsemilia, right?

23
00:02:52,917 --> 00:02:56,625
Sinsemilla. This grass made
Thai stick taste like oregano.

24
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:58,792
Lay you out flat, man.

25
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,042
- Got a red light, sir.
- What on?

26
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:07,208
Number eight. Warhead alarm.

27
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,583
Give it a thump with your finger.

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,292
Alarm reset.

29
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:34,917
Skybird, this is Dropkick with
a Red dash Alpha message in two parts.

30
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:37,083
Break. Break. Red dash Alpha.

31
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,792
- Stand by to copy message.
- Standing by.

32
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:43,208
Romeo Oscar November Charlie

33
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,917
Tango Tango Lima Alpha.

34
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:53,333
Authentication: 220040 Delta

35
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,042
Lima.

36
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:58,208
I have a valid message.
Stand by to authenticate.

37
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,833
I agree with authentication also, sir.

38
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,250
- Enter launch code.
- Entering launch code.

39
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:29,833
- Launch order confirmed.
- Holy shit!

40
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:39,125
Target selection: complete.
Time on target sequence: complete.

41
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:42,667
- Yield selection: complete.
- Begin countdown. Tminus 60.

42
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:45,875
- All right. Let's do it. Insert launch key.
- Stand by.

43
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,583
- Launch key inserted.
- Roger.

44
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,958
On my mark... rotate launch key to Set.

45
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,667
Three... two... one...

46
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,792
- Mark.
- Tminus 50.

47
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:11,958
Roger. At Set.

48
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,833
- Sir?
- Tminus 40.

49
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,458
- Enable missiles.
- Number one enabled. Two enabled.

50
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,833
- Three enabled.
- Get somebody on the goddamn phone.

51
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,208
Seven... eight...

52
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,167
Nine...

53
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,625
Ten. All missiles enabled.

54
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,958
- Get me Wing Command Post. Direct line.
- That's not the correct procedure.

55
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:47,500
- Try SAC Headquarters on the HF.
- That's not the procedure.

56
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:51,917
I want somebody on the goddamn phone
before I kill 20 million people.

57
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,292
T minus 20.

58
00:05:57,417 --> 00:06:01,333
I got nothin' here! They might
have been knocked out already.

59
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,083
Right.

60
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:06,375
On my mark,
rotate launch keys to Launch.

61
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:08,750
Roger. Ready to go to Launch.

62
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:11,250
- Fourteen...
- Thirteen... twelve...

63
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,667
Eleven...

64
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:19,208
Seven... six...

65
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,667
- Five...
- Sir, we have a launch order.

66
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:24,917
- Three... two...
- Put your hand on the key, sir.

67
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,917
One... Launch!

68
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:34,083
- Sir, we are at launch! Turn your key!
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

69
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,833
Turn your key, sir!

70
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,375
They're cleared. Go ahead and open it up.

71
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:36,500
- Hello. I'm Pat Healy.
- I'm Lyle Watson. This is Arthur Cabot.

72
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:41,250
I'm Pat Healy, Dr McKittrick's assistant.
I've got some passes for you here.

73
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:44,250
We had scheduled a meeting
pending your arrival.

74
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,083
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask me.

75
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,333
I'd be happy to fill you in
if there's any way I can.

76
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,042
They're here.

77
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:48,750
Good.

78
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,375
Let's go.

79
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,583
Cabot and Watson came alone.
No senators. No congressmen.

80
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:00,083
I wish they'd brought a few senators.
I'd like to tell 'em what's going on here.

81
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,917
John, please! Don't start that right away.

82
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:05,625
I had them on the phone
and they're calmed down.

83
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,000
Well, are we positive that these men had
no way of knowing this was only a test?

84
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:16,750
Lyle, for God's sakes! How many times
are we gonna go through this?

85
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:20,333
- It doesn't make any difference.
- I've spoken to these men.

86
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,792
They all believed it was the real deal.

87
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:25,667
Look, we gotta be on a plane
in less than an hour.

88
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:29,958
I have to explain to the president
why 22% of his missile commanders

89
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:34,833
failed to launch their missiles. What
am I supposed to say? 22% isn't so bad?

90
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:39,667
The president knows that I am fully
responsible for the men in my command.

91
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:43,750
I've ordered a re-evaluation of
our psychological screening procedure.

92
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,208
Wait a minute. Excuse me, General.

93
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,417
We can't ask these men
to go back to the president

94
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:53,875
with a lot of headshrinker horseshit!
You can't screen out human response!

95
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,792
Those men know what it means to turn
the keys, and some are just not up to it!

96
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:01,583
Now, it's as simple as that!

97
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,042
I think we oughta take
the men out of the loop.

98
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,750
- Mr McKittrick, you're out of line, sir.
- Why am I out of line?

99
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,417
Excuse me!

100
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:18,167
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
Take them out of the loop?

101
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,083
Gentlemen! We've had men in these silos

102
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:24,750
since before any of you
were watching Howdy Doody.

103
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:31,750
For myself, I sleep pretty well at night
knowing those boys are down there.

104
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:36,000
General, we know they're fine men,
but in a nuclear war we can't afford

105
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,917
to have missiles
lying dormant in those silos

106
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:42,875
because those men refuse to turn
the keys when the computers tell 'em to!

107
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,208
You mean when
the president orders them to.

108
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:50,083
The president will probably follow
the computer war plan. That's a fact!

109
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,958
I imagine the Joint Chiefs
will have some input.

110
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,708
- You're damn tootin'.
- Well, hell...

111
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,333
In a surprise attack, there's no time.

112
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:01,000
23 minutes from warning to impact.

113
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:04,292
- Six minutes if it's sub-launched.
- Six minutes.

114
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:08,250
That's barely enough time
for the president to make a decision.

115
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,333
Once he makes the decision,
the computer should take over.

116
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:15,208
Now, sir, I know that you've got
a plane waiting for you,

117
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,833
but if you could indulge me,
I'd like to show you something.

118
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,667
These computers give instant access
to the state of the world.

119
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:33,208
Troop movements, Soviet
missile tests, weather patterns.

120
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:37,208
It all flows into this room,
and then into the WOPR computer.

121
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,875
- WOPR? What is that?
- War Operation Plan Response.

122
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,833
This is Mr Richter.

123
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,833
Paul, would you like to tell
these gentlemen about the WOPR?

124
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,458
Well, the WOPR spends all its time
thinking about World War Ill.

125
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:58,833
24 hours a day, 365 days a year,
it plays an endless series of war games

126
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,500
using all available information
on the state of the world.

127
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:06,500
The WOPR has already fought
World War Ill, as a game,

128
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:08,708
time and time again.

129
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:12,042
It estimates Soviet responses
to our responses

130
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,458
to their responses, and so on.

131
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,167
Estimates damage. Counts the dead.

132
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:20,042
Then it looks for ways
to improve its score...

133
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,625
The point is that the key decisions

134
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,875
of every option have already
been made by the WOPR.

135
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,667
So all this trillion-dollar hardware
is really at the mercy

136
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:32,167
of those men with the little brass keys?

137
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:36,042
That's exactly right. Whose only problem
is that they're human beings.

138
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:41,000
But in 30 days we could put in electronic
relays. Get the men out of the loop.

139
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,750
Gentlemen...

140
00:13:43,917 --> 00:13:48,500
I wouldn't trust this overgrown pile of
microchips further than I could throw it.

141
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:54,292
I don't know if you wanna trust the safety
of our country to some... silicon diode...

142
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:58,042
Nobody is talking about entrusting
the safety of the nation

143
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:00,208
to a machine, for God's sake!

144
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,375
We'll keep control,
but here at the top where it belongs.

145
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,917
All right, gentlemen.

146
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:09,167
I think I'm going to recommend
McKittrick's idea to the president.

147
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,792
And I'll get back to you on this.

148
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,667
You won't regret this.

149
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,042
OK. You had fries and a Coke, right?

150
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,667
Damn!

151
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,208
- Hi, David!
- Hi, Howie!

152
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:08,333
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

153
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,708
- You wanna take this over? I gotta go.
- Sure!

154
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,875
- Go ahead.
- Thanks!

155
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:22,583
- Bye, David!
- Bye!

156
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:36,042
All right. Question number two.

157
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:44,042
Seeds that are germinated in water
before they are planted will... what?

158
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,500
- Robert?
- Sprout roots?

159
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:48,333
Ah! David!

160
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:52,958
Nice of you to join us.
Oh, David. I have a little present for you.

161
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:07,083
Question number four.
In the history of science,

162
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,792
novel and innovative concepts
occasionally arise

163
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:13,417
from sudden left-field inspiration.

164
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:15,292
Miss Mack...

165
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,792
Could you tell us your answer
to question number four?

166
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:22,458
Why do nitrogen nodules
cling to the roots of plants?

167
00:16:25,042 --> 00:16:27,083
Love?

168
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:34,708
Jennifer, what do you know about
nitrogen nodules that we don't?

169
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:38,333
Some bit of salacious info
to which you alone are privy?

170
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,000
- No.
- I see.

171
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,417
No, you didn't know
the correct answer - symbiosis.

172
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,958
Because you don't pay attention in class.

173
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,625
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

174
00:16:54,792 --> 00:17:00,042
There seems to be a lot of confusion on
this next question - asexual reproduction.

175
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,375
Could someone tell me, please

176
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:08,833
who first suggested the idea
of reproduction without sex?

177
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,750
- Miss Mack!
- Yes?

178
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,500
What is so amusing?

179
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,917
What?

180
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:28,750
All right, Lightman.

181
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:34,083
Maybe you can tell us who first suggested
the idea of reproduction without sex.

182
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,625
Your wife?

183
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,000
Get out, Lightman! Get out!

184
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:55,208
Mr Ligget wants me to discuss
my attitude problem with Mr Kessler.

185
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,667
I think Mr Kessler's getting tired
of your attitude problem.

186
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,458
Me, too.

187
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:34,708
Lightman. What a... surprise.

188
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,875
Won't you come in?

189
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,917
Hi!

190
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,042
Hi!

191
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:58,208
Sorry if I got you in trouble.
I couldn't stop laughing.

192
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,375
That's OK. You were perfect.

193
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,542
- I was?
- Yeah.

194
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:04,708
- You want a ride home?
- Yeah.

195
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,875
Hop on.

196
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:19,375
- So you got an F on that test today, too?
- Yep.

197
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,292
Guess we're both gonna be
stuck in summer school.

198
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:25,333
- Not me.
- Why not? You have to make up biology.

199
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:28,417
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

200
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:33,125
- Why not? Come on! Tell me. Why not?
- Make a left.

201
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,375
Why don't you come up to my house
and I'll show you?

202
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,583
What are you gonna show me?

203
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,875
I'm gonna show you.
I'll show you how you do it.

204
00:19:43,292 --> 00:19:46,000
- Hi, Bo!
- Oh! Hi, Bo!

205
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,167
Hey, Bo! How you doin'?

206
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,750
My room's upstairs.

207
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,958
- Your parents aren't home?
- No. They both work.

208
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:31,208
A little mess.

209
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,375
It's OK. You should see my room.

210
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,792
- You're really into computers, huh?
- Yeah.

211
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:54,542
- What are you doing?
- I'm dialing into the school's computer.

212
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:11,542
They change the password every couple
of weeks, but I know where they write it.

213
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:27,208
- Are those your grades?!
- Yeah.

214
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,708
I don't think that I deserved an F, do you?

215
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,208
- You can't do that!
- Already done.

216
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,875
- Do you have a middle initial?
- K. Katherine.

217
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,917
Those are my grades.

218
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:54,833
- How can anybody get a D in home EC?
- That's none of your business.

219
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,333
- Can you erase this?
- No. It's too late.

220
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,333
What are you doing?

221
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:03,375
- I'm changing your biology grade.
- No. You'll get me in trouble.

222
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,458
Nobody can find out. You got a C!
Now you won't go to summer school.

223
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,708
- Change it back.
- Why? They can't...

224
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:13,000
- I said change it back.
- OK. OK.

225
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,125
I guess I'd better get going.

226
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:26,708
Thanks for the ride.

227
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,667
Yeah. OK. Bye.

228
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,833
Bye.

229
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:35,583
Get down. Get down. You've already
had your dinner. Now just sit.

230
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:37,792
Sit! Stay!

231
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,708
- Don't forget to take out the garbage.
- David.

232
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:43,708
- Put that lid on real tight.
- I know, Ma.

233
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:48,125
Yes, they will carry back on the second.

234
00:23:49,417 --> 00:23:52,917
Sure. I think we can really work out
some creative financing.

235
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:56,750
Oh, but you've gotta see it!

236
00:23:56,917 --> 00:23:59,625
There's a Jacuzzi
in the master bedroom...

237
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,417
Oh, sure. We can work that out.

238
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:18,625
That is true. You'll have a balloon
payment at the end of five years.

239
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,167
But that's nothing.
The economy is gonna be great then.

240
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,417
He who dances must pay the piper.

241
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:28,292
- See you, Dad.
- I'll meet you tomorrow at 9.30. Bye.

242
00:24:31,292 --> 00:24:33,333
You know, I worry about that kid.

243
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,500
Why?

244
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:40,000
Sometimes I think
we're all gonna get electrocuted.

245
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:46,250
This corn is raw!

246
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:49,000
I know. Isn't it wonderful? It's so crisp.

247
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:52,000
- Of course it's crisp! It's raw!
- It's terrific!

248
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:55,250
You can just taste the vitamin
A and D in here. It's great.

249
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:59,083
Couldn't we have pills,
and cook the corn?

250
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:02,417
- What city, please?
- For Sunnyvale, California.

251
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,583
The number for Protovision.

252
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:07,958
Yes. That's 555 8632.

253
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:13,125
Thank you. Could you also tell me
what other prefixes cover that area?

254
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:18,708
There's 399, 437, 767, 936.

255
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:20,250
Thanks.

256
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:38,208
Protovision... I have you now.

257
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,792
Yes?

258
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:09,417
Saul's Fish Market.

259
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:23,625
- Hi!
- Oh, hi!

260
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,292
What?

261
00:26:28,417 --> 00:26:31,333
I've been thinking.
That thing with my grade.

262
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:34,125
- Can you still change it?
- Oh, I don't know...

263
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:38,042
I can't believe I was so stupid.
I should've just let you do it.

264
00:26:38,167 --> 00:26:41,250
- I don't know. It might be kinda rough.
- Why?

265
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:43,750
They might have changed the password.

266
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:46,417
Maybe they didn't. Can't we at least try?

267
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,792
- Damn!
- Please.

268
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:53,375
OK.

269
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:58,167
- You owe me a quarter.
- Yeah. Come on. Sorry I lost your game.

270
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,500
- What's it doing?
- Oh. It's dialing numbers.

271
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:15,458
- Don't touch the keys!
- I'm not touching the keys.

272
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:18,083
Excuse me.

273
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:22,708
This computer company's coming out
with these amazing new games soon.

274
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:25,750
The programs are probably
still on their computer.

275
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:30,500
So I told my system to search for other
computers in Sunnyvale, California.

276
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:38,708
They answer with a tone that other
computers can recognize. You hear?

277
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:41,292
You're calling every number
in Sunnyvale?

278
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:47,458
- Isn't that expensive?
- There's ways around that.

279
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,292
You can go to jail for that.

280
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:52,542
Only if you're over 18.

281
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:58,125
Is this going to take a long time?
I'd like to get my grade changed.

282
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,958
Oh. That's funny, actually.

283
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:03,167
Cos...

284
00:28:03,292 --> 00:28:05,417
I already changed it.

285
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:08,875
- I told you not to do that.
- Yeah, I know.

286
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,083
But I figured you'd change your mind.
I didn't want you to flunk.

287
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:16,583
- Well, what did I get?
- You got a D.

288
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:20,125
- You gave me a D?
- No. You got an A.

289
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,250
- I was kidding.
- Oh.

290
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:24,583
Well, that's OK.

291
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:26,917
Here. Let's see what we have so far.

292
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:29,667
Excuse me.

293
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:31,833
Did you really give me an A?

294
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:34,000
Yeah.

295
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:37,250
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

296
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:44,250
Hey! You got a bank!

297
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:47,500
Gotta make a note of that one.
Might come in handy someday.

298
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,500
Pan Am.

299
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,542
- Where shall we go?
- Anywhere?

300
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:59,708
- Anywhere.
- New York?

301
00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:02,667
- New York. OK.
- No, Paris. Paris.

302
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,875
Will you be traveling alone?

303
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,750
Yeah... No. You wanna go with me?

304
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:14,375
OK.

305
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:19,875
- All right. Smoking or nonsmoking?
- Nonsmoking.

306
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:25,875
All right, Miss Mack. You're
confirmed on Pan Am's flight 1 14

307
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,958
Ieaving Chicago's O'Hare Airport
at 8.15am on 18 August.

308
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:33,583
Do we need a rental car? No.

309
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:38,333
- Do we really have tickets to Paris?
- No. You have a reservation though.

310
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:48,083
It doesn't identify itself.

311
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:50,500
Try anything.

312
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:59,417
"Connection terminated." How rude.

313
00:29:59,542 --> 00:30:01,583
We'll ask it for help.

314
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:03,917
- Can you do that?
- On some systems.

315
00:30:04,042 --> 00:30:08,250
The more complicated they are,
the more they have to help you out.

316
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:17,375
Now what?

317
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:20,208
Help games.

318
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:28,333
"Games" refers to models,
simulations and games

319
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:31,625
which have strategic applications.
What does that mean?

320
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,833
I don't know. That's gotta be them.
Turn on the printer.

321
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,458
List games.

322
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:03,750
Oh, my God!

323
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,042
So these guys can tell you
what that print-out means?

324
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:20,083
They probably invented it
in the first place.

325
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:41,375
- Can you wait here?
- Why?

326
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,458
- Cos these guys can get a little nervous.
- OK.

327
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:55,750
Jim.

328
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:56,958
Oh. Lightman.

329
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,042
Hi, Lightman!

330
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:05,250
I want you to take a look at this.

331
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:14,542
- Hey! What's that?
- I wanted Jim to see that.

332
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:18,958
Wow! Where'd you get this?

333
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:22,667
Protovision. I wanted to see
the program for their new games.

334
00:32:22,792 --> 00:32:25,208
- Can I have this?
- I'm not through yet.

335
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:32,458
Remember you told me to tell you when
you were acting rudely and insensitively?

336
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:35,542
You're doing it right now.

337
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,708
"Theatrewide biotoxic
and chemical warfare."

338
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:49,833
- This didn't come from Protovision.
- Ask him where it did come from, Jim!

339
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,125
- I told you already.
- Looks military to me. Definitely.

340
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:57,250
- Probably classified, too.
- If it's military, why does it have games

341
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:01,667
- Iike checkers and backgammon?
- Those games teach basic strategy.

342
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,958
Jim, how do I get into that system?
I wanna play those games.

343
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:09,375
That system probably contains
the new data encryption algorithm.

344
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:13,208
- You'll never get in.
- No system is totally secure.

345
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:15,833
- I bet you Jim could get in.
- I bet you he couldn't!

346
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:19,500
- I bet you he could.
- You won't get through frontline security.

347
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:23,083
- But you might look for a back door.
- I can't believe it, Jim!

348
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:26,250
That girl's listening,
and you talk about back doors!

349
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:27,583
Mr Potato-head.

350
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:30,583
Mr Potato-head!
Back doors are not secrets!

351
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:34,625
- You're giving away all our best tricks.
- They're not tricks.

352
00:33:34,792 --> 00:33:37,792
- What's a back door?
- Whenever I design a system

353
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:40,375
I put in a password
that only I know about.

354
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,292
That way, whenever I wanna get back in,

355
00:33:43,417 --> 00:33:48,167
I can bypass whatever security they've
added on. That's basically what it is.

356
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:50,208
Yeah?

357
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:54,917
OK. You really wanna get in, find out
about the guy who designed the system.

358
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:57,333
Come on! I don't even
know the guy's name.

359
00:33:57,458 --> 00:34:02,542
Boy, are you guys dumb! You guys are
so dumb. I got this thing all figured out.

360
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:05,292
Oh, yeah, Malvin? How would you do it?

361
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:09,542
The first game in the list.
Go right through Falken's Maze.

362
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:17,625
Hi! I'm Jennifer.

363
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,750
- Is David here?
- How do you do?

364
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:21,917
Yeah. He's up in his room.

365
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,167
Thanks.

366
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:28,083
Have you ever heard
of the word tumulus?

367
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:31,083
Tumulus? No. I haven't. I'm sorry.

368
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:33,250
Neither have l.

369
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,500
Yeah?

370
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:38,917
Hi!

371
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:41,833
- Where have you been?
- What?

372
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,208
I haven't seen you all week in school.
Are you sick?

373
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:49,208
No, no. I was...

374
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:52,500
I was doing things.
You wanna sit down? How are you?

375
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:55,208
- No. I'm going to get some water, OK?
- OK.

376
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:58,958
- What is all that stuff?
- Oh, it's nothing. I was just...

377
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:03,292
I was trying to find out about the guy
who designed those game programs,

378
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:05,750
so I could get his secret password.

379
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:08,542
- Why?
- Why? Cos...

380
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:11,833
What's so special about playing
games with some machine?

381
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:13,167
Oh, no...

382
00:37:13,292 --> 00:37:15,542
No, it's not just some machine.

383
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:18,042
Here. Look at this.

384
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,792
This is a tape that I got from the library.

385
00:37:20,917 --> 00:37:23,000
It's about this guy named Falken.

386
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:27,417
He was into games as well as computers.

387
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:31,333
He designed them so that
they could play checkers or poker.

388
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,833
- Chess.
- What's so great about that?

389
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:37,583
- Everybody's doing that now.
- Oh, no, no. What he did was great!

390
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:41,167
He designed his computer
so it could learn from its mistakes.

391
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:44,000
So they'd be better
the next time they played.

392
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:46,792
The system actually learned how to learn.

393
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,750
It could teach itself.

394
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:54,708
If I could just get that damn password,
I could play the computer.

395
00:37:56,792 --> 00:37:59,583
That's him. That's Falken.

396
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:03,917
That's him? Wow!

397
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:06,083
He's amazing-looking!

398
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:10,250
Can't you write to him
or call him somehow?

399
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:11,792
No. He's dead.

400
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,792
- He's dead?
- Yeah.

401
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,042
Here. Look. Here's his obituary.

402
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:22,292
- He wasn't very old.
- Well, he was pretty old. He was 41 .

403
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:25,208
Oh, yeah? Oh, that's old.

404
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:30,000
That's his little boy.

405
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:32,167
Oh, yeah?

406
00:38:32,292 --> 00:38:37,500
This is really sad. Did you know the child
and his mother were killed in a car crash?

407
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:39,792
- I know.
- "In the years that followed

408
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:44,083
the tragic loss of his family,
Dr Falken's health deteriorated."

409
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:53,125
My dad is 45.

410
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,500
- Once he was really sick...
- What was his name?

411
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:04,083
- My father?
- No, no, no. Falken's kid.

412
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:07,125
Joshua.

413
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,292
It can't be that simple.

414
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,000
- Wow!
- What?

415
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,042
We got something.

416
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:35,750
We're in!

417
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,417
It thinks I'm Falken!

418
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:41,833
Hello.

419
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:50,583
- How can it ask you that?
- It'll ask whatever it's programmed to.

420
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:52,750
- Do you wanna hear it talk?
- Yeah!

421
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:55,542
I'll ask it how it feels.

422
00:39:56,875 --> 00:40:01,542
I'm fine. How are... you?

423
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:06,000
Excellent. It's been a long time.

424
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:13,500
Can you explain the removal of
your user account on June 23rd, 1973?

425
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:15,667
They must have told it he died.

426
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:22,875
People sometimes make... mistakes.

427
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,750
- Yes, they do.
- How can it talk?

428
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:31,042
It's not a real voice. This box interprets
signals and turns them into sound.

429
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:33,667
Shall we play a game?

430
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:35,208
Oh!

431
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:39,250
- I think it missed him.
- Yeah. Weird, isn't it?

432
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:41,042
Love to!

433
00:40:41,167 --> 00:40:47,375
How about Global Thermonuclear War?

434
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:52,625
Wouldn't you prefer
a good game of chess?

435
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,750
Later.

436
00:40:53,875 --> 00:40:54,958
Let's play

437
00:40:56,417 --> 00:40:59,250
Global Thermonuclear War.

438
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:01,167
Fine.

439
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,917
All right!

440
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,792
Wow!

441
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:11,500
Which side do you want?

442
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:15,667
I'll be the Russians.

443
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:22,292
Please list primary targets.

444
00:41:22,417 --> 00:41:25,917
- Who shall we nuke first?
- Let's see.

445
00:41:26,042 --> 00:41:28,833
How about... Las Vegas?

446
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:31,417
Las Vegas! Great!

447
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:35,750
- What next? Seattle!
- Yeah!

448
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:39,083
Kill 'em!

449
00:41:49,792 --> 00:41:53,458
I have seven, correction, eight Red birds
two degrees past apogee.

450
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:57,750
Better get the old man down here.

451
00:41:57,875 --> 00:42:00,000
We have Soviet missile warning.

452
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:02,625
Check formal function
and report confidence.

453
00:42:02,792 --> 00:42:07,000
Projected target areas
NORAD regions 25, 26.

454
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:25,333
This is Crystal Palace initiating
emergency conference. Stand by!

455
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:29,542
19 degrees past apogee.

456
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:35,125
Possible 18 targets in track.
Estimate re-entry at 19.23 Zulu.

457
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:46,333
- What you got up here, Joe?
- We have a radar tracking.

458
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:49,708
Eight inbound Soviet ICBMs
already over the pole.

459
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:53,583
Estimated impact: 1 1 minutes.
Target area: Western United States.

460
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:58,000
- Why didn't we get a launch detection?
- We're checking for DSP malfunction.

461
00:42:58,125 --> 00:43:01,917
BMEWS has continuous radar tracking
on inbounds.

462
00:43:02,042 --> 00:43:06,125
Confidence is high.
I repeat, confidence is high.

463
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:14,417
- What is all that stuff?
- Trajectory headings

464
00:43:14,583 --> 00:43:18,083
- for multiple-impact re-entry vehicles.
- What does that mean?

465
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:20,250
I don't know. But it's great!

466
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:23,208
- Are those bombs? Which is the bombs?
- Subs.

467
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:25,583
- Blow 'em up.
- Blow 'em out of the water.

468
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,417
- What's a trajectory heading?
- I've no idea.

469
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:36,917
The president's diverting to Andrews.
The vice president is out of position.

470
00:43:37,042 --> 00:43:42,333
- The chairman of the Joint Chiefs is on...
- Missile warning reports no malfunction.

471
00:43:42,458 --> 00:43:44,500
Take us to DEFCON 3.

472
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:47,375
Get onto SAC.
Tell 'em to flush the bombers.

473
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,875
Yes, sir.

474
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:54,833
SAC, this is Crystal Palace.
CinC NORAD has declared DEFCON 3.

475
00:43:54,958 --> 00:43:59,958
Scramble all alert aircraft.
I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.

476
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:02,125
Inbounds presently MIRVing.

477
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,875
We now have approximately
24 possible targets in track.

478
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:10,417
- New time to impact: eight minutes.
- SAC is launching the bombers.

479
00:44:10,583 --> 00:44:13,292
- General Powers is on the line.
- Beringer.

480
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:18,750
Goddamn it! We didn't get
a launch detection from our satellite.

481
00:44:18,875 --> 00:44:24,125
Radar picked 'em up already out of the
atmosphere. That's the first we heard of it.

482
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:28,083
Get the ICBMs in the bullpen
warmed up and ready to fly.

483
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:32,083
- Get me the president on the horn.
- Yes, sir.

484
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,750
Mr President? This is Beringer at NORAD.

485
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:43,917
Oh, attack!

486
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:47,792
- I wonder if I should use my subs.
- Sure. Give 'em the works.

487
00:44:47,917 --> 00:44:49,958
David!

488
00:44:51,542 --> 00:44:53,417
Excuse me.

489
00:44:53,542 --> 00:44:55,583
David!

490
00:44:56,167 --> 00:44:59,500
How many times have I told you
to fasten these lids on tight?!

491
00:44:59,625 --> 00:45:02,500
- Look at this mess!
- I'll be down in a few minutes.

492
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:05,292
Now! Come down now!
I want this cleared up now!

493
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:09,542
Come down here and do what
your father asks you to pronto, David.

494
00:45:10,292 --> 00:45:12,292
We're gonna barbecue tonight.

495
00:45:12,417 --> 00:45:15,708
- You wanna invite your little friend?
- Please!

496
00:45:15,833 --> 00:45:16,917
David!

497
00:45:19,167 --> 00:45:21,208
Shit!

498
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:29,125
Little friend.

499
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:41,375
Mr President, something's happening.
I'll get back to you as soon as I know.

500
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:46,750
- What's happening, Joe?
- BMEWS and Cobra Dane now report

501
00:45:46,875 --> 00:45:50,125
negative confirmation
on all inbound tracking.

502
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:53,958
Get onto SAC. Tell 'em to hold steady.

503
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:59,750
Stop! It's a simulation!
There's an attack simulation running!

504
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:02,333
What the hell's he yelling about?
I didn't order that.

505
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,333
We're not being attacked!
It's a simulation!

506
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,125
Whoa, now! Hold it!

507
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,500
You're not supposed to be runnin' here.

508
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:11,667
We don't know how it happened.

509
00:46:11,792 --> 00:46:15,708
Someone outside fed an attack simulation
into the main... It's a simulation!

510
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:17,333
Conley...

511
00:46:17,458 --> 00:46:19,333
Take us off full alert.

512
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:24,292
Hold at DEFCON 4 till we find out exactly
what in the hell's happening here!

513
00:46:24,417 --> 00:46:28,833
I didn't tell you to cut the line!
Did I tell you to cut it? You cut the line!

514
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:31,708
They shut down
before we could complete our trace.

515
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:35,000
We did locate the area
where the transmission originated.

516
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,167
- Where?
- Seattle, Washington.

517
00:46:37,292 --> 00:46:39,167
Shut it down!

518
00:46:39,292 --> 00:46:41,500
Somebody's playing a game with us.

519
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:44,208
At a prophylactic recycling centre...

520
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:45,333
Hi, Dad!

521
00:46:46,167 --> 00:46:47,375
David!

522
00:46:48,083 --> 00:46:50,417
- David, come in here!
- What did I do?

523
00:46:50,542 --> 00:46:52,583
Plenty, mister. Plenty.

524
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:57,833
You have just passed
all of your classes this semester.

525
00:46:57,958 --> 00:47:00,000
Congratulations, dear!

526
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:02,167
Show this to your dad.

527
00:47:02,292 --> 00:47:05,667
Honey! David has something to show you.

528
00:47:05,792 --> 00:47:07,833
- What's that?
- Here, Dad.

529
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,792
Uh-oh.

530
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:14,125
This is good!

531
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,292
I'm so proud of you!

532
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,708
..went on a full-scale nuclear alert,

533
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:22,000
believing the Soviet Union
had launched a missile attack.

534
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:25,583
A spokesman places blame
on a computer malfunction,

535
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:28,792
emphasizing that the problem
has been corrected.

536
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:32,292
For more on the story,
let's go live to Washington DC.

537
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,042
Well, that's your phone.

538
00:47:37,167 --> 00:47:39,208
Yeah.

539
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:43,500
Seriously, David. Congratulations.
This one'll be a pleasure to sign!

540
00:47:49,917 --> 00:47:51,708
- Hello?
- David?

541
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:53,625
Are you watching the news?

542
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,333
Jennifer. Yeah, I'm watching.

543
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:59,125
David, is that us on TV? Did we do that?

544
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,708
It could be. Oh, Jesus, Jennifer!

545
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:06,000
What am I gonna do? They're gonna
come get me. I'm really screwed!

546
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:08,167
I'm screwed!

547
00:48:08,292 --> 00:48:12,083
No! Sh! Calm down!
Sh! Calm down, calm down. Listen...

548
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:15,125
If they were so smart,
they would have found you already.

549
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,250
Yeah.

550
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:20,833
OK. So all you have to do is throw
the number away and don't call it again.

551
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:22,208
- That's all.
- Yeah.

552
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:27,292
- Maybe they didn't trace the call.
- Right! Maybe they didn't trace the call.

553
00:48:27,417 --> 00:48:31,333
I'm sure they didn't trace the call.
All you have to do is act normal.

554
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:34,375
We'll both act normal
and everything will be fine.

555
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,750
OK?

556
00:48:35,917 --> 00:48:37,958
- OK.
- OK.

557
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:42,708
God! This is so unbelievable!
Can I call Michelle and tell her?

558
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:44,958
No, Jennifer! Don't call her!

559
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:48,958
Sorry. All right. I won't.
I'll talk to you tomorrow, OK?

560
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:51,500
OK. Good night, Jennifer.

561
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,917
Greetings, Professor Falken.

562
00:49:26,125 --> 00:49:27,625
Oh, my God.

563
00:49:35,417 --> 00:49:39,333
Incorrect identification.

564
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,792
I am not Falken.

565
00:49:41,917 --> 00:49:44,958
Falken is dead.

566
00:49:46,792 --> 00:49:49,250
Sorry to hear that, Professor.

567
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:51,833
Yesterday's game was interrupted.

568
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:57,917
Although primary goal has not yet
been achieved, solution is near.

569
00:49:58,042 --> 00:50:03,500
Game time elapsed:
31 hours 12 minutes 50 seconds.

570
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:10,667
Estimated time remaining:
52 hours 17 minutes 10 seconds.

571
00:50:10,792 --> 00:50:15,167
What is the primary goal?

572
00:50:16,292 --> 00:50:20,167
You should know, Professor.
You programmed me.

573
00:50:20,292 --> 00:50:22,333
Oh, come on.

574
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:26,208
What is the primary goal?

575
00:50:28,583 --> 00:50:30,500
To win the game.

576
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:02,083
David Lightman, hold it right there. FBI.

577
00:52:02,208 --> 00:52:04,833
- I'll read you your rights.
- Step over to the van.

578
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:07,750
You have the absolute right
to remain silent.

579
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,917
What did I do?

580
00:52:10,042 --> 00:52:12,542
You have the right
to consult with an attorney

581
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:15,000
and to have one present
during questioning.

582
00:52:15,125 --> 00:52:18,917
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed to you by the court.

583
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:21,500
- Do you understand these rights?
- Yeah.

584
00:52:21,625 --> 00:52:25,250
Are you willing to talk to me
about the charges against you?

585
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,375
All right. Let's move.

586
00:52:39,958 --> 00:52:42,792
This rather large room
is command center for NORAD.

587
00:52:42,917 --> 00:52:47,417
No picture taking. The screens in front
of you are connected to our satellites

588
00:52:47,542 --> 00:52:50,750
and missile tracking stations
throughout the country.

589
00:52:50,875 --> 00:52:54,000
This is the commander's desk.
Colonel Conley is in charge.

590
00:52:54,125 --> 00:52:56,875
Would you mind relinquishing
your command, sir?

591
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,875
Miss Dailey, would you come
and sit in this rather important chair?

592
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,583
These buttons are connected
with the Strategic Air Command

593
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:06,792
and missile launching stations.

594
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:10,250
Miss Dailey, would you press
this button here? The red one.

595
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:12,333
- The one in the middle?
- Yes, ma'am.

596
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:14,958
Oh, my God! It's the wrong one!

597
00:53:15,083 --> 00:53:18,625
It's a joke! You didn't blow up anything.
Look what you did do.

598
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:21,625
"Distinguished visitors
from Birmingham."

599
00:53:51,542 --> 00:53:54,542
Last week I had the governor
of New Jersey in this chair.

600
00:53:54,667 --> 00:53:58,833
He said, "Colonel Thomas, why are we
at DEFCON 4?" as we are right now.

601
00:53:58,958 --> 00:54:01,000
Why are we at DEFCON 4?

602
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:04,042
The Soviets saw our bombers scramble
and went on alert.

603
00:54:04,167 --> 00:54:09,083
We told them it was just an exercise, but
we want them to relax their posture first.

604
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:10,458
Wait. Wait.

605
00:54:10,583 --> 00:54:13,083
- Give me that.
- Oh, Christ. Another tour group.

606
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:17,333
Just what we need today. Why don't they
go to Disneyland where they belong?

607
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:21,625
- Well, I think they're going to tomorrow.
- OK. All set? Oh, here.

608
00:54:24,792 --> 00:54:26,833
It was a one-in-a-million shot.

609
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,792
There was an open line
at our division in Sunnyvale.

610
00:54:29,917 --> 00:54:31,958
The phone company screwed up!

611
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:35,125
- John. John McKittrick, George Wigan.
- How are you?

612
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:37,708
George is with the FBI.
He brought the kid in.

613
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:41,083
It looks like we've got
a high-school prank on our hands.

614
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:43,042
Paul, what happened?

615
00:54:43,167 --> 00:54:47,958
The kid broke into the war game using a
password left by the original programmer.

616
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:49,667
- A password?
- Yes, sir.

617
00:54:49,792 --> 00:54:51,833
None of my team even knew it was there.

618
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:54,667
Kid claims
he was looking for a toy company.

619
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:58,042
That's great!
Anybody in here buy that one?

620
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:03,042
We can find the password and take it out,
but it might help to beef up security.

621
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:05,167
Oh. Beef up, huh?

622
00:55:05,917 --> 00:55:07,375
How about screwed up?

623
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,167
We did all that and he broke in again.

624
00:55:10,292 --> 00:55:13,083
Kid says your computer called him.

625
00:55:13,208 --> 00:55:15,833
What the hell is going on, John?

626
00:55:15,958 --> 00:55:20,042
I woke up the president. I told him
we were under attack by the Russians.

627
00:55:20,167 --> 00:55:24,333
You know what an idiot that makes me
look? Not to mention the general.

628
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:26,583
I think we're being a little naive here.

629
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:28,792
There is no way a high-school punk

630
00:55:28,875 --> 00:55:31,917
can put a dime in a telephone
and break into our system.

631
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,375
He's got to be working
with somebody else.

632
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:38,333
He fits the profile perfectly.
He's intelligent, but an underachiever.

633
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:41,250
Alienated from his parents.
Has few friends.

634
00:55:41,417 --> 00:55:43,875
Classic case
for recruitment by the Soviets.

635
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,708
What does this say
about the state of our country?

636
00:55:46,833 --> 00:55:51,417
I mean, have you gotten any insight
as to why a bright boy like this

637
00:55:51,542 --> 00:55:53,833
would jeopardies the lives of millions?

638
00:55:53,958 --> 00:55:56,167
He says
he does this sort of thing for fun.

639
00:55:56,292 --> 00:55:59,708
Dammit, John, I want some answers,
and I want 'em now!

640
00:56:03,167 --> 00:56:06,833
- Let me talk to this little prick.
- I don't wanna talk. Just do it!

641
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:10,542
Come on, Paul.

642
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:16,292
Who do they belong to? Do you know?

643
00:56:16,417 --> 00:56:17,833
What?

644
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:19,167
Good morning, sir.

645
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:22,417
- Where's the Lightman kid?
- In the infirmary, sir.

646
00:56:31,417 --> 00:56:35,625
Hello, David. John McKittrick.
I run the computer facility here.

647
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:38,500
Sergeant, these aren't necessary,
the handcuffs?

648
00:56:38,625 --> 00:56:40,042
No, sir.

649
00:56:41,167 --> 00:56:44,458
Well, David, we called your parents.

650
00:56:44,583 --> 00:56:46,875
We told them everything's fine.

651
00:56:47,042 --> 00:56:49,917
No charges have been filed... yet.

652
00:56:50,042 --> 00:56:54,792
But I think we are gonna need
a little time to sort things out here.

653
00:56:55,292 --> 00:56:56,750
How much time?

654
00:56:56,875 --> 00:57:00,250
Well, that depends on
how willing you are to cooperate.

655
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,458
Oh, of course.

656
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:08,042
Sergeant, would you tell the OD
I'm gonna take David for a little walk?

657
00:57:08,167 --> 00:57:11,875
Let's go down to my office.
We'll be more comfortable there.

658
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,042
Go ahead.

659
00:57:18,292 --> 00:57:20,625
You used to work with Stephen Falken?

660
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:23,292
I started as his assistant.
How d'you know?

661
00:57:23,417 --> 00:57:26,750
I read an article you wrote with him
on poker and nuclear war.

662
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:29,333
Bluffing. Yeah,
that shook a few people up.

663
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:33,583
- He must have been pretty amazing.
- He's a brilliant man. A little flaky.

664
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:37,792
He never understood the practical uses
of his... of his work.

665
00:57:37,917 --> 00:57:41,167
This machine over here
runs his game program.

666
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:42,375
Joshua.

667
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:46,625
Come here a minute, David.

668
00:57:48,625 --> 00:57:50,667
See that sign up here? Up here?

669
00:57:50,792 --> 00:57:52,500
- Yeah.
- DEFCON.

670
00:57:52,625 --> 00:57:55,958
That indicates
our current defense condition.

671
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:58,958
It should read DEFCON 5,
which means peace.

672
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:02,708
It's still on 4 because of
that little stunt you pulled.

673
00:58:02,833 --> 00:58:07,208
Actually, if we hadn't caught it in time,
it might have gone to DEFCON 1 .

674
00:58:07,375 --> 00:58:10,625
- You know what that means, David?
- No. What does that mean?

675
00:58:10,792 --> 00:58:12,375
World War Ill.

676
00:58:13,667 --> 00:58:14,708
Wow.

677
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:17,875
You broke into our system
just to play a game, right?

678
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,375
That's right. That's exactly right.

679
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:27,625
After the news, you must have
realized how serious it was.

680
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:30,083
- Why'd you do it again?
- I didn't do it again.

681
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:33,167
- I even threw the number away.
- They found it in the trash.

682
00:58:33,292 --> 00:58:34,583
Joshua called me.

683
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:36,583
Hey!

684
00:58:36,708 --> 00:58:39,042
Look at that! That's some setup.

685
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:42,458
- What did you say?
- This is some setup.

686
00:58:42,583 --> 00:58:44,375
No, no. Before that.

687
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,542
Joshua called me.

688
00:58:48,042 --> 00:58:50,333
David, machines don't call people.

689
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:53,792
Yours did.

690
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:59,625
Who are you going to Paris with?

691
00:59:01,667 --> 00:59:02,833
Paris? Oh!

692
00:59:02,958 --> 00:59:04,750
No... You don't understand.

693
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:07,333
You had reservations for two to Paris.

694
00:59:10,542 --> 00:59:12,875
- Who are you working with?
- Nobody!

695
00:59:14,917 --> 00:59:16,958
Why don't I believe you?

696
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:23,625
I don't think I should say anything else
until I talk to a lawyer.

697
00:59:25,125 --> 00:59:28,333
I think we'd better forget
about the lawyer crap

698
00:59:28,458 --> 00:59:31,042
until I get a few answers
out of you myself.

699
00:59:49,583 --> 00:59:51,625
Are you gonna answer the phone?

700
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:56,917
Hello.

701
00:59:57,042 --> 00:59:58,292
Yeah.

702
00:59:58,417 --> 00:59:59,417
What?

703
01:00:00,167 --> 01:00:02,208
All right. I'll be right down.

704
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:05,250
You stay here. Don't move.

705
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:18,333
What's going on?

706
01:00:18,458 --> 01:00:22,333
There's been a serious penetration
into our WOPR execution order file.

707
01:00:22,458 --> 01:00:24,833
- What the hell's he sayin'?
- In English.

708
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:28,417
I'll give it to you. Somebody got
into Mr McKittrick's system

709
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:31,292
and stole the codes
that'll launch our missiles.

710
01:00:31,417 --> 01:00:35,208
There's no cause for alarm.
The system won't accept a launch code

711
01:00:35,375 --> 01:00:39,042
unless we're at DEFCON 1 .
I can change those codes in an hour.

712
01:00:39,167 --> 01:00:40,625
Well, who did this?

713
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:43,708
I think the kid's working
with somebody on the outside.

714
01:00:43,792 --> 01:00:48,458
I don't know what they're up to, but
I don't want our bombers on the ground.

715
01:00:48,583 --> 01:00:51,792
Take us to DEFCON 3
and get SAC on the line.

716
01:00:51,917 --> 01:00:54,375
- Where are you?
- Sir.

717
01:00:54,542 --> 01:00:58,875
Get me an update on those subs. I wanna
know what those bastards are up to.

718
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:28,292
Joshua.

719
01:01:29,667 --> 01:01:31,708
Greetings, Professor Falken.

720
01:01:34,917 --> 01:01:35,958
Hello.

721
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:38,875
Are you still playing the game?

722
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,792
Of course. I should reach DEFCON 1

723
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:47,708
and launch my missiles in 28 hours.

724
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:52,333
Would you like to see
some projected kill ratios?

725
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,917
69% of the housing destroyed.

726
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:58,167
72 million people dead?

727
01:02:02,125 --> 01:02:05,000
Is this a game

728
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:07,208
or is it real?

729
01:02:07,333 --> 01:02:09,375
What's the difference?

730
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,667
Oh, wow.

731
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,958
You are a hard man to reach.

732
01:02:15,083 --> 01:02:17,125
Could not find you in Seattle

733
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:22,042
and no terminal is in operation
at your classified address.

734
01:02:27,792 --> 01:02:31,292
What classified address?

735
01:02:33,042 --> 01:02:37,375
DOD pension files
indicate current mailing as:

736
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:42,000
Dr Robert Hume.

737
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:45,000
AKA Stephen W Falken.

738
01:02:47,125 --> 01:02:52,083
5 Tall Cedar Road,
Goose island, Oregon 97...

739
01:02:52,208 --> 01:02:56,208
Can I just talk to Mr McKittrick?
I think I know what's going on.

740
01:02:56,333 --> 01:03:00,083
I'm escorting you to Denver
where you'll be placed under arrest,

741
01:03:00,208 --> 01:03:03,125
- pending indictment for espionage.
- Espionage?!

742
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:05,792
Let me talk to him!
He's right over there.

743
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:10,042
- Get that bastard out of the war room!
- No! It's Joshua!

744
01:03:10,167 --> 01:03:13,250
He's still playing the game!
He's gonna start a war!

745
01:03:13,375 --> 01:03:16,625
Hold him where you had him before.
We'll leave in a few minutes.

746
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:20,833
Call Falken. He'll tell you. Please,
call him. Please, call him. Call him!

747
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,458
What the hell's he doing in here anyway?

748
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:43,667
Some of the men told me
that you're quite a tennis player.

749
01:04:54,208 --> 01:05:00,208
Patient's eyes are dilated, consistent
with use of marijuana and possibly PCP.

750
01:05:29,542 --> 01:05:33,417
Depending on what information you want,
there's a button to press.

751
01:05:33,542 --> 01:05:36,542
Let's say I wanted to find out
how to hit a backhand.

752
01:05:36,667 --> 01:05:39,167
I don't think I have the right program.

753
01:05:39,292 --> 01:05:41,875
Excuse me. What do you want?

754
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,375
Bathroom. It's a long ride to Denver.

755
01:05:44,542 --> 01:05:46,583
Excuse me.

756
01:05:51,875 --> 01:05:54,375
Please! Let me talk to Mr McKittrick.

757
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,583
You can't talk to anybody.
The FBI be here any minute.

758
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:00,167
- Do you have to take a leak or not?
- No.

759
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,667
- I'm working here.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

760
01:06:29,792 --> 01:06:31,833
Stop it!

761
01:06:31,958 --> 01:06:34,792
- You have pretty eyes.
- That's original.

762
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:41,333
I'll get the elevator.

763
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,542
- Sign in here?
- Yeah, get us all.

764
01:07:06,083 --> 01:07:10,333
I heard they voted you
Miss Fine in 1979. Is that true?

765
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:12,500
Will you stop it?!

766
01:07:12,625 --> 01:07:14,667
- Am I bothering you?
- Yes.

767
01:07:14,792 --> 01:07:17,417
- Do you want me to leave?
- Yes.

768
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,792
I want this door open right now.

769
01:08:31,917 --> 01:08:35,750
- How about getting on the phone?
- Is there a technician?

770
01:09:09,958 --> 01:09:12,167
Hey, Scooter! Wait up.

771
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:15,542
Come on, hurry it up. I'm late.

772
01:09:15,708 --> 01:09:17,750
OK. I'll be right with you.

773
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:21,333
- I think it's jammed from inside.
- Come on.

774
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:26,000
David! Come on, David.
You're just making it harder on yourself.

775
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,750
OK.

776
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:32,917
Let's go.

777
01:09:41,042 --> 01:09:43,583
Right this way, folks. I've been informed

778
01:09:43,708 --> 01:09:47,167
that they're cleaning the floors
in the computer center.

779
01:09:47,292 --> 01:09:51,375
Don't want anyone to slip and hurt
themselves, so we'll end the tour here.

780
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:55,000
If I can ask you to board the bus
as quickly as possible,

781
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:59,292
you'll have a complimentary beverage
waiting for each of you.

782
01:09:59,417 --> 01:10:01,333
Hold it! What are you doing?

783
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:03,583
Got it. Here it comes.

784
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:10,000
- You kids think you own this place?
- Oh! I was... just looking around.

785
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:14,250
You're not supposed to leave the group.
So get back there!

786
01:10:14,375 --> 01:10:17,125
OK. Excuse me.
Thank you very much, sir.

787
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,042
Out of the way.

788
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:23,708
Thank you. Careful there.

789
01:10:24,375 --> 01:10:26,125
Take care. Watch your step.

790
01:10:26,292 --> 01:10:28,167
- Bye.
- Bye now.

791
01:10:28,333 --> 01:10:29,833
Watch your step.

792
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:33,542
- Check everywhere. He can't be far.
- Move it, will you?

793
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:30,875
- Thanks.
- Take care.

794
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,042
Bye.

795
01:13:07,125 --> 01:13:10,458
- What city, please?
- Goose island, Oregon, please.

796
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:15,333
The number for Dr Robert Hume,
H-U-M-E, on Tall Cedar Road.

797
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:21,333
Checking under Dr. Robert Hume,
H-U-M-E, on Tall Cedar Road,

798
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:23,292
I find no listing.

799
01:13:23,417 --> 01:13:26,042
What does that mean?
He doesn't have a phone?

800
01:13:26,167 --> 01:13:28,208
I'm sorry. I have no listing.

801
01:13:28,375 --> 01:13:30,417
Oh, wait.

802
01:13:30,542 --> 01:13:35,917
Falken. Dr Stephen Falken,
F-A-L-K-E-N, at the same address.

803
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:40,833
I find no listing
for a Dr Stephen Falken, F-A-L-K-E-N,

804
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:43,250
on Tall Cedar Road, Goose island.

805
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:45,333
Thank you.

806
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:02,750
Yeah?

807
01:14:02,917 --> 01:14:04,625
Jennifer? It's me. David.

808
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:06,500
- David?
- Yeah.

809
01:14:06,625 --> 01:14:09,000
Listen, I'm in Colorado

810
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:11,417
and I need a really big favour.

811
01:14:11,542 --> 01:14:13,875
- Can you lend me some money?
- What?

812
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,958
I need an airline ticket.
I'll pay you back when I can.

813
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:20,083
I need a ticket from Grand Junction,
Colorado to Oregon.

814
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:23,333
- Why? What's going on?
- I'll tell you all about it later.

815
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:25,708
David, what are you doing in Colorado?

816
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:28,833
I went by your house.
Your parents were just freaked.

817
01:14:28,958 --> 01:14:32,167
There are men around from the FBI
asking questions.

818
01:14:32,292 --> 01:14:34,333
I can't talk about it right now.

819
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:40,000
When you buy the ticket, tell them that
I'll pick it up in Grand Junction Airport.

820
01:14:40,083 --> 01:14:42,083
David, what's happening?

821
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:46,542
I can't talk. I've gotta get off the phone.
Please, will you just do this for me?

822
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,917
Punch up number five.
Let me see what you have.

823
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:59,042
22 Typhoon-class submarines
departing Petropavlovsk,

824
01:14:59,167 --> 01:15:02,625
turning southbound at Nordkapp,
bearing 095 degrees.

825
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:05,000
Sergeant, I hope you like vodka.

826
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:09,625
Yes, sir. I just hope they don't make me
eat none of them damn fish eggs.

827
01:15:14,375 --> 01:15:16,542
Give me an update...

828
01:15:16,667 --> 01:15:20,542
Sir, the Soviets deny any increase
in their submarine deployment.

829
01:15:20,667 --> 01:15:22,917
They wanna know
why we're provoking them.

830
01:15:23,042 --> 01:15:26,000
They're full of shit.
We know they're down there.

831
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:28,792
I'm gonna blow their ass out of the water.

832
01:16:09,792 --> 01:16:11,458
Surprise!

833
01:16:12,542 --> 01:16:16,667
- What are you doing here?
- You didn't sound too good on the phone.

834
01:16:16,792 --> 01:16:19,875
- You shouldn't have come. I'm in trouble.
- Why?

835
01:16:20,833 --> 01:16:23,500
Is this because of
what you did with my grade?

836
01:16:30,625 --> 01:16:33,583
You kids better hustle.
The ferry leaves any second.

837
01:16:33,708 --> 01:16:35,708
Thanks. Come on. We gotta run.

838
01:16:40,417 --> 01:16:43,542
- Wait, wait, wait, wait! Whoa!
- Hold it, hold it!

839
01:16:52,917 --> 01:16:56,333
If he's still alive,
why would the obituary say he's dead?

840
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:58,500
No, he's not dead. He left.

841
01:16:58,625 --> 01:17:02,083
When they know too much,
they give 'em new identities.

842
01:17:02,208 --> 01:17:05,292
- Anyway, the computer said so.
- Oh, the computer said so.

843
01:17:05,417 --> 01:17:09,750
The computer that's still playing
the games? It's the military's computer!

844
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:13,500
- Why wouldn't they know about it?
- They don't know about Joshua.

845
01:17:13,625 --> 01:17:17,417
Falken knows about Joshua. He's
the only one who knows what it can do.

846
01:17:17,542 --> 01:17:21,500
That computer is trying to win the game
that we asked it to play.

847
01:17:21,625 --> 01:17:23,667
For real!

848
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:25,875
You don't even believe me!

849
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:33,208
David... David.

850
01:17:34,958 --> 01:17:37,000
- He's not dead.
- I'm sorry.

851
01:17:40,583 --> 01:17:42,583
I believe you.

852
01:18:29,958 --> 01:18:31,750
Oh!

853
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:33,292
What was that?

854
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:35,125
I don't know.

855
01:18:39,875 --> 01:18:44,583
Did you see that? There are still people
who won't believe they could fly.

856
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:46,875
The sky was once filled with them.

857
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,792
- I'm looking for Dr Robert Hume.
- Is either of you a paleontologist?

858
01:18:50,917 --> 01:18:52,958
No. We're high-school students.

859
01:18:53,083 --> 01:18:55,125
Oh... Pity.

860
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:58,083
Well, high-school students,

861
01:18:58,208 --> 01:19:00,958
you're on my land and I didn't invite you.

862
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:02,083
But

863
01:19:02,208 --> 01:19:04,542
aren't you Stephen Falken?

864
01:19:05,583 --> 01:19:07,625
Now, listen carefully.

865
01:19:08,208 --> 01:19:10,250
Path. Follow path.

866
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:14,208
Gate. Open gate, through gate, close gate.

867
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:16,875
Last ferry 6.30, so run, run, run.

868
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,333
Wait! Wait.

869
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,500
I came because of Joshua.

870
01:20:03,208 --> 01:20:07,917
Radar reports two unknown tracks are
penetrating the Alaskan air defense zone.

871
01:20:09,458 --> 01:20:13,417
Confidence is high. Flight profile
suggests Soviet backfire bombers.

872
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:18,042
I want a visual confirmation on that.
Scramble two F-16s out of Galena.

873
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:21,792
Go to DEFCON 2.

874
01:20:54,542 --> 01:20:59,375
Crystal Palace, this is Delta Foxtrot 27.
I have negative radar contact.

875
01:20:59,542 --> 01:21:01,708
Repeat, negative Soviet aircraft.

876
01:21:01,833 --> 01:21:04,917
27, this is Brass Hat.
They're right in front of you!

877
01:21:05,083 --> 01:21:07,125
You're almost on top of 'em.

878
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:09,792
Brass Hat, we got nothing on radar

879
01:21:09,958 --> 01:21:12,000
and 40 miles visibility.

880
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:15,917
There's nothin' out there, General.
Just blue skies.

881
01:21:16,042 --> 01:21:18,083
What the hell?!

882
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,542
- You haven't been listening.
- Yes, I have.

883
01:21:31,667 --> 01:21:34,083
I loved it when you nuked Las Vegas.

884
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:37,667
A suitably biblical ending for the place,
don't you think?

885
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:40,375
Are you gonna tell them
what Joshua's doing?

886
01:21:42,292 --> 01:21:46,833
Now, children, come on over here.
I'm going to tell you a bedtime story.

887
01:21:46,958 --> 01:21:49,250
Are you sitting comfortably?

888
01:21:49,375 --> 01:21:51,292
Then I'll begin.

889
01:21:51,417 --> 01:21:57,500
Once upon a time, there lived
a magnificent race of animals

890
01:21:57,625 --> 01:22:00,750
who dominated the world
through age after age.

891
01:22:00,875 --> 01:22:02,708
They ran and they swam

892
01:22:02,833 --> 01:22:05,167
and they fought and they flew.

893
01:22:05,292 --> 01:22:09,333
Until suddenly,
quite recently, they disappeared.

894
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:13,792
Nature just gave up and started again.

895
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,542
We weren't even apes then.

896
01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:20,750
We were just these smart little rodents
hiding in the rocks.

897
01:22:20,875 --> 01:22:24,625
And when we go, nature will start again.

898
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:27,542
With the bees probably.

899
01:22:28,417 --> 01:22:31,000
Nature knows when to give up, David.

900
01:22:31,125 --> 01:22:33,167
I'm not giving up.

901
01:22:33,292 --> 01:22:37,125
If Joshua tricks them
into launching an attack, it'll be your fault.

902
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:42,083
My fault? The whole point was
to find a way to practice nuclear war

903
01:22:42,208 --> 01:22:44,250
without destroying ourselves.

904
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:48,250
To get the computers to learn from
mistakes we couldn't afford to make.

905
01:22:48,375 --> 01:22:51,875
Except I never could get Joshua
to learn the most important lesson.

906
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,417
What's that?

907
01:22:54,417 --> 01:22:57,917
Futility. That there's a time
when you should just give up.

908
01:22:58,083 --> 01:23:00,125
What kind of a lesson is that?

909
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:02,708
Did you ever play tic-tac-toe?

910
01:23:04,083 --> 01:23:05,417
Yeah. Of course.

911
01:23:05,542 --> 01:23:07,583
- But you don't any more?
- No.

912
01:23:07,708 --> 01:23:08,833
Why?

913
01:23:09,958 --> 01:23:12,750
Because it's a boring game.
It's always a tie.

914
01:23:12,875 --> 01:23:15,000
Exactly. There's no way to win.

915
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:17,708
The game itself is pointless.

916
01:23:18,375 --> 01:23:22,375
But back at the war room,
they believe you can win a nuclear war.

917
01:23:23,417 --> 01:23:26,167
That there can be acceptable losses.

918
01:23:27,167 --> 01:23:30,542
So you gave up? Decided to play dead?

919
01:23:31,417 --> 01:23:35,375
For security reasons,
they graciously arranged my death.

920
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,208
Did you know that no land animal

921
01:23:39,333 --> 01:23:42,875
with a body weight of over 50lb
survived that age?

922
01:23:43,917 --> 01:23:46,917
Extinction is part of the natural order.

923
01:23:47,042 --> 01:23:48,417
Bullshit!

924
01:23:50,042 --> 01:23:53,292
If we're extinguished, it's not natural.
It's just stupid!

925
01:23:53,417 --> 01:23:55,833
Oh, it's all right. I've planned ahead.

926
01:23:56,542 --> 01:23:59,458
We're just three miles
from a primary target.

927
01:24:00,417 --> 01:24:02,625
A millisecond of brilliant light

928
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:04,500
and we're vaporised.

929
01:24:04,625 --> 01:24:08,917
Much more fortunate than the millions
who'll wander sightless

930
01:24:09,042 --> 01:24:11,542
through the smoldering aftermath.

931
01:24:12,792 --> 01:24:15,375
We'll be spared the horror of survival.

932
01:24:16,042 --> 01:24:18,542
I'm only 17 years old.

933
01:24:19,708 --> 01:24:21,583
I'm not ready to die yet.

934
01:24:21,708 --> 01:24:23,875
You won't make a simple phone call?

935
01:24:26,042 --> 01:24:29,458
If the real Joshua was still alive,
your Joshua,

936
01:24:29,625 --> 01:24:32,917
- you'd do it, wouldn't you?
- Look, we might gain a few years.

937
01:24:33,042 --> 01:24:36,417
Perhaps time enough for you
to have a son and watch him die.

938
01:24:37,958 --> 01:24:40,958
But humanity
planning its own destruction...

939
01:24:41,875 --> 01:24:43,917
That a phone call won't stop.

940
01:24:44,625 --> 01:24:48,958
This is unreal! You don't care about death
cos you're already dead.

941
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:54,042
I know a lot about you.
I know you weren't always like this.

942
01:24:54,208 --> 01:24:56,542
What was the last thing you cared about?

943
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,500
You've missed the last ferry.

944
01:25:11,125 --> 01:25:14,625
You're welcome to stay.
You want to sleep on the floor?

945
01:25:19,208 --> 01:25:21,208
Good night.

946
01:25:23,583 --> 01:25:25,083
Let's get outta here.

947
01:25:35,292 --> 01:25:38,500
Come on. We'll find a boat.
There's gotta be a boat.

948
01:25:56,125 --> 01:25:59,958
Mr President, we've got 48 nuclear subs
closing on the United States.

949
01:26:00,125 --> 01:26:03,625
And we've got 100,000 Soviet troops
massing in East Germany.

950
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:06,917
We're monitoring their bombers
that are on alert. Yes, sir...

951
01:26:07,042 --> 01:26:09,083
Well, that's a load of shit!

952
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:10,792
No, sir. Not you.

953
01:26:10,917 --> 01:26:14,917
Yes, sir. We'll be in touch
as soon as the information changes.

954
01:26:15,042 --> 01:26:19,333
Intelligence reports rumours of a new
Soviet bomber with Stealth capabilities.

955
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:23,250
It can project a false radar image
600 miles away from the real aircraft.

956
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:25,833
Christ! Now they got us chasing shadows.

957
01:26:38,167 --> 01:26:40,208
I think I saw one.

958
01:26:44,833 --> 01:26:49,458
What kind of an asshole lives on an island
and he doesn't even have a boat?

959
01:26:49,583 --> 01:26:52,708
Maybe we can swim for it.
How far do you think it is?

960
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:55,083
No. It's two or three miles.

961
01:26:55,167 --> 01:26:57,208
At least. Maybe more.

962
01:26:57,333 --> 01:27:00,125
- Well, what do you say? Let's go for it.
- No.

963
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:01,833
- Come on.
- No!

964
01:27:01,958 --> 01:27:03,375
I can't swim.

965
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,042
You can't swim?

966
01:27:06,208 --> 01:27:08,250
No. OK, Wonder Woman? I can't swim.

967
01:27:08,375 --> 01:27:12,417
What kind of an asshole grows up
in Seattle and doesn't know how to swim?

968
01:27:12,542 --> 01:27:14,708
I never got around to it, OK?

969
01:27:14,833 --> 01:27:18,000
I always thought
there was gonna be plenty of time!

970
01:27:18,125 --> 01:27:20,292
I'm sorry.

971
01:27:24,708 --> 01:27:27,083
I wish I didn't know about any of this.

972
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:31,375
I wish I was like
everybody else in the world.

973
01:27:32,167 --> 01:27:34,458
Then tomorrow it would just be over.

974
01:27:37,417 --> 01:27:39,875
There wouldn't be any time to be sorry.

975
01:27:41,375 --> 01:27:43,417
About anything.

976
01:27:49,917 --> 01:27:51,917
Oh, Jesus!

977
01:27:53,083 --> 01:27:55,458
I really wanted to learn how to swim.

978
01:27:56,625 --> 01:27:58,667
I swear to God I did.

979
01:28:07,792 --> 01:28:10,000
Did I tell you that next week

980
01:28:11,042 --> 01:28:13,083
I was gonna be on TV?

981
01:28:13,208 --> 01:28:15,542
You're kidding?

982
01:28:15,667 --> 01:28:18,917
On that aerobics show
with some girls from my dad's class.

983
01:28:19,042 --> 01:28:21,000
A movie star.

984
01:28:21,125 --> 01:28:23,125
Yeah!

985
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:27,833
It's kinda stupid, huh? I mean, nobody
would have been watching me anyway.

986
01:28:27,958 --> 01:28:29,167
I would have.

987
01:28:48,708 --> 01:28:50,208
Oh, Jesus!

988
01:28:50,333 --> 01:28:52,375
The bastard turned us in!

989
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:55,792
It's all right. Get in.

990
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:26,208
We have a launch detection.
We have a Soviet launch detection.

991
01:30:26,333 --> 01:30:28,375
BMEWS has confirmed a massive attack.

992
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:31,583
- Missile warning. No malfunction.
- Confidence is high.

993
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:34,958
- Cobra Dane, is this an exercise?
- This is not an exercise.

994
01:30:35,083 --> 01:30:38,792
General, DPS is tracking
300 inbound Soviet ICBMs.

995
01:30:45,458 --> 01:30:48,667
- Tell me this is one of your simulations.
- It's not, Jack.

996
01:30:48,792 --> 01:30:52,542
All right. Flush the bombers.
Get the subs in launch mode.

997
01:30:53,583 --> 01:30:55,625
We are at DEFCON 1 .

998
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:56,750
DEFCON 1.

999
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:04,042
Major Lem, get me a report on the WOPR.

1000
01:31:06,167 --> 01:31:09,708
Initial attack profile
is a full-scale Soviet strike.

1001
01:31:09,833 --> 01:31:13,833
WOPR is putting our losses
at 85 to 95% of the strategic forces.

1002
01:31:13,958 --> 01:31:16,417
What does WOPR recommend,
Mr McKittrick?

1003
01:31:16,542 --> 01:31:18,958
Full-scale retaliatory strike.

1004
01:31:20,583 --> 01:31:22,875
I need some machine to tell me that?

1005
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,167
President's on his way
to join Airborne Command.

1006
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:28,042
We have to give launch option.

1007
01:31:28,167 --> 01:31:31,875
- Has he spoken to the premier?
- The Russians deny everything.

1008
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,458
We have a Soviet submarine
launch detection.

1009
01:31:35,167 --> 01:31:38,500
Let's go into a launch mode.
Close up the mountain.

1010
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:48,917
This is Crystal Palace.
We're closing up the mountain.

1011
01:31:49,083 --> 01:31:52,167
After the gates are closed,
nobody gets in or out.

1012
01:31:58,917 --> 01:32:00,958
Initiate internal power.

1013
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:04,167
Generators on and functioning.

1014
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,042
External power disconnected.

1015
01:32:18,708 --> 01:32:20,750
Seal off ventilation shafts.

1016
01:32:20,875 --> 01:32:22,708
Shaft locks sealed.

1017
01:32:27,458 --> 01:32:29,583
The gate's closed!

1018
01:32:37,208 --> 01:32:39,125
Is everybody OK?

1019
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:41,833
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Run for it!

1020
01:32:45,250 --> 01:32:47,292
The gate's gonna shut! Come on!

1021
01:32:47,417 --> 01:32:49,458
Come on!

1022
01:33:01,667 --> 01:33:03,708
Hold the door! Hold the door!

1023
01:33:07,542 --> 01:33:09,875
Hold the goddamn door!

1024
01:33:14,708 --> 01:33:16,750
Come on! Hurry!

1025
01:33:19,417 --> 01:33:21,417
They're clear! They're clear!

1026
01:33:40,417 --> 01:33:44,333
All units confirm weapons targeted
and ready. Awaiting launch codes.

1027
01:33:44,458 --> 01:33:46,500
We are in a launch mode.

1028
01:33:46,625 --> 01:33:48,917
Major Lem, lock out changes.

1029
01:33:49,125 --> 01:33:51,125
Roger. Lock out enabled.

1030
01:34:01,125 --> 01:34:03,125
All right. I'll call you back.

1031
01:34:03,292 --> 01:34:05,708
Here!

1032
01:34:12,458 --> 01:34:15,667
I don't know what you think
you can do here, Stephen.

1033
01:34:15,792 --> 01:34:19,458
John! Good to see you!
I see the wife still picks your ties.

1034
01:34:19,625 --> 01:34:22,958
- What has this kid been telling you?
- How far has it gone?

1035
01:34:23,083 --> 01:34:28,458
The president's ready for a counterstrike.
That's what we're recommending he do.

1036
01:34:30,250 --> 01:34:33,917
- It's a bluff, John. Call it off.
- No, it's not a bluff. It's real.

1037
01:34:34,042 --> 01:34:36,833
Hello, General Beringer? Stephen Falken.

1038
01:34:37,417 --> 01:34:40,417
Mr Falken, you picked
a hell of a day for a visit.

1039
01:34:40,542 --> 01:34:44,875
General, what you see
on these screens up here is a fantasy.

1040
01:34:45,042 --> 01:34:47,875
A computer-enhanced hallucination.

1041
01:34:48,042 --> 01:34:51,292
Those blips are not real missiles.
They're phantoms.

1042
01:34:51,417 --> 01:34:55,625
There's nothing to indicate a simulation.
Everything's working perfectly.

1043
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:58,542
- Does it make any sense?
- Does what make any sense?

1044
01:34:58,667 --> 01:34:59,583
That!

1045
01:34:59,708 --> 01:35:03,292
Look, I don't have time
for a conversation right now.

1046
01:35:03,417 --> 01:35:06,875
General, are you prepared
to destroy the enemy?

1047
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
You betcha!

1048
01:35:08,125 --> 01:35:12,167
- Do you think they know that?
- I believe we've made that clear enough.

1049
01:35:12,292 --> 01:35:14,125
Then... don't.

1050
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:17,292
Tell the president to ride out the attack.

1051
01:35:17,417 --> 01:35:19,667
Sir, they need a decision.

1052
01:35:20,667 --> 01:35:24,125
General, do you really believe
that the enemy would attack

1053
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:27,583
without provocation,
using so many missiles and subs,

1054
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:31,167
so that we would have no choice
but to totally annihilate them?

1055
01:35:31,292 --> 01:35:33,583
One minute and 30 seconds to impact.

1056
01:35:33,708 --> 01:35:36,458
General, you are listening to a machine.

1057
01:35:37,458 --> 01:35:39,958
Do the world a favour
and don't act like one.

1058
01:35:44,833 --> 01:35:47,333
One minute and 20 seconds to impact.

1059
01:35:59,167 --> 01:36:00,500
Yes, Mr President.

1060
01:36:00,625 --> 01:36:04,833
Sir, at this point in time, we cannot
positively confirm the inbounds.

1061
01:36:04,958 --> 01:36:07,750
We have reason to believe
they may not exist.

1062
01:36:07,875 --> 01:36:10,250
Yes, sir. That's affirmative.

1063
01:36:11,792 --> 01:36:12,875
Yes, sir.

1064
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,292
I do, too.

1065
01:36:14,417 --> 01:36:16,500
One minute to impact.

1066
01:36:17,292 --> 01:36:19,333
Who's first and how soon?

1067
01:36:19,458 --> 01:36:22,458
Initial impact
in the 43rd Bomb Wing at Loring,

1068
01:36:22,625 --> 01:36:25,750
319th at Grand Forks,
and Alaskan Air Command, Elmendorf.

1069
01:36:25,875 --> 01:36:27,917
50 seconds to impact.

1070
01:36:28,042 --> 01:36:31,125
Get me the senior controllers.
I wanna talk to 'em myself.

1071
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:33,375
All stations, this is Crystal Palace.

1072
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:36,333
Stand by for a message from Brass Hat.
Acknowledge.

1073
01:36:36,458 --> 01:36:40,125
Elmendorf Air Force Base Operations.
Lieutenant Colonel Bowers.

1074
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:43,417
319th Bomb Wing Operations.
Colonel Chase.

1075
01:36:43,542 --> 01:36:48,792
Colonel, this is Loring Air Force Base.
The senior controller isn't here right now.

1076
01:36:48,917 --> 01:36:50,958
That's all right. Who are you?

1077
01:36:51,125 --> 01:36:53,750
Sir, this is Airman Dougherty, sir.

1078
01:36:55,083 --> 01:36:57,333
This is General Beringer at NORAD.

1079
01:36:57,458 --> 01:36:59,500
Our current situation...

1080
01:37:00,583 --> 01:37:03,792
Men, we're currently tracking

1081
01:37:03,917 --> 01:37:07,083
approximately 2,400 inbound
Soviet warheads.

1082
01:37:07,208 --> 01:37:09,792
But at the moment
we cannot confirm this.

1083
01:37:09,917 --> 01:37:12,542
I repeat, we cannot confirm this.

1084
01:37:12,667 --> 01:37:14,542
30 seconds to impact.

1085
01:37:15,167 --> 01:37:19,333
We're right there with you guys.
We've taken all the steps we can.

1086
01:37:20,167 --> 01:37:22,792
Stand by to launch missiles
at my command.

1087
01:37:30,375 --> 01:37:32,875
Stay on this channel as long as you can.

1088
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,042
We'll be standing by.

1089
01:37:35,167 --> 01:37:37,208
20 seconds to impact.

1090
01:37:47,208 --> 01:37:49,667
Ten... nine...

1091
01:37:49,792 --> 01:37:52,667
eight... seven...

1092
01:37:52,792 --> 01:37:54,208
six...

1093
01:37:54,333 --> 01:37:56,042
five...

1094
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:57,250
four...

1095
01:37:57,375 --> 01:37:58,708
three...

1096
01:37:58,833 --> 01:38:00,083
two...

1097
01:38:00,208 --> 01:38:02,250
one... Impact.

1098
01:38:19,583 --> 01:38:21,792
This is Crystal Palace. Are you still on?

1099
01:38:23,792 --> 01:38:28,167
This is Crystal Palace.
Are you still on? Anyone there?

1100
01:38:28,917 --> 01:38:30,958
That's affirmative, sir.

1101
01:38:32,208 --> 01:38:33,542
Yeah! We're here!

1102
01:38:33,667 --> 01:38:37,292
- Jesus H Christ! We're still here!
- Our boards are showing impact.

1103
01:38:38,958 --> 01:38:42,458
No, sir. No impact. We're alive and well.

1104
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:44,042
All right!

1105
01:38:44,583 --> 01:38:46,000
All right!

1106
01:38:51,292 --> 01:38:53,333
All right!

1107
01:38:59,833 --> 01:39:02,083
All right! Recall the bombers!

1108
01:39:02,208 --> 01:39:04,375
Stand down the missiles!

1109
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,417
Joshua, what are you doing?

1110
01:39:41,708 --> 01:39:44,125
COC, I need Dr McKittrick right away.

1111
01:39:44,750 --> 01:39:47,333
- This is McKittrick.
- Sir, we got a problem.

1112
01:39:47,458 --> 01:39:49,667
WOPR's not letting me log back on.

1113
01:39:49,792 --> 01:39:53,125
- I can't get in to stand down the missiles.
- Stand by.

1114
01:40:06,042 --> 01:40:07,667
Paul, this is McKittrick.

1115
01:40:07,792 --> 01:40:10,042
The WOPR's not letting us back in.

1116
01:40:10,167 --> 01:40:13,708
I know. No one can get back on.
We're trying everything.

1117
01:40:13,875 --> 01:40:17,292
It's like the entire password file
has been wiped out.

1118
01:40:17,417 --> 01:40:20,292
I tried that! Don't you think
I would have tried that?

1119
01:40:23,625 --> 01:40:25,458
What are those?

1120
01:40:25,583 --> 01:40:27,625
Those are launch codes.

1121
01:40:27,792 --> 01:40:29,833
What are they for?

1122
01:40:29,958 --> 01:40:34,208
Joshua's trying to find the right codes
so he can launch the missiles himself.

1123
01:40:44,625 --> 01:40:45,750
What's happening?

1124
01:40:45,875 --> 01:40:48,375
The random number generators
aren't running.

1125
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:50,542
- Got anything?
- I'm still looking.

1126
01:40:50,667 --> 01:40:53,333
I got no idea.
It could be coming from anywhere.

1127
01:40:55,375 --> 01:40:57,583
Sir, you better get on the headset.

1128
01:40:59,625 --> 01:41:00,625
Yeah?

1129
01:41:00,792 --> 01:41:05,833
General, the machine has locked us out.
It's sending random numbers to the silos.

1130
01:41:05,958 --> 01:41:08,000
Codes. To launch the missiles.

1131
01:41:08,083 --> 01:41:10,125
Just unplug the goddamn thing!

1132
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:13,500
- Jesus Christ!
- That won't work, General.

1133
01:41:13,667 --> 01:41:17,000
It would interpret a shutdown
as the destruction of NORAD.

1134
01:41:17,125 --> 01:41:21,958
The computers in the silos would carry
out their last instructions. They'd launch.

1135
01:41:22,083 --> 01:41:25,500
- Can't we disarm the missiles?
- Over a thousand of them?

1136
01:41:25,625 --> 01:41:29,667
There's no time. At this rate
it'll hit the launch codes in 5.3 minutes.

1137
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:35,583
Mr McKittrick?
After very careful consideration, sir,

1138
01:41:35,708 --> 01:41:40,083
I have come to the conclusion
that your new defense system sucks.

1139
01:41:41,042 --> 01:41:43,917
I don't have to take that,
you pig-eyed sack of shit.

1140
01:41:44,083 --> 01:41:48,958
I was hoping for something a little better
than that from a man of your education.

1141
01:41:49,083 --> 01:41:51,125
General, it's the president.

1142
01:41:56,083 --> 01:41:59,042
What do you...
What are you gonna tell him?

1143
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:03,417
That I'm ordering our bombers
back to fail-safe.

1144
01:42:03,542 --> 01:42:06,625
We might have to go through
this thing after all.

1145
01:42:09,333 --> 01:42:10,333
Yes, sir.

1146
01:42:17,417 --> 01:42:20,958
He's got one. When he gets all ten,
he'll launch the missiles.

1147
01:42:21,083 --> 01:42:24,458
- Well, can't they get in and stop it?
- No. They can't.

1148
01:42:27,125 --> 01:42:30,042
They've taken out my password.

1149
01:42:30,167 --> 01:42:33,083
- Well, what are we gonna do?
- I don't know. Do you?

1150
01:42:33,208 --> 01:42:36,542
I told you not to start
playing games with that thing.

1151
01:42:40,542 --> 01:42:41,750
It's games.

1152
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:45,958
- Games!
- Try it.

1153
01:42:46,083 --> 01:42:49,708
- John, feed it a tapeworm.
- Too risky. It might smash the system.

1154
01:42:49,833 --> 01:42:52,500
- Did the kid get in the back door?
- We took it out.

1155
01:42:52,625 --> 01:42:55,000
- Invade the deep logic.
- We hit a fire wall.

1156
01:42:55,125 --> 01:42:58,250
If it wants to play a game, then play it.
Have it list games.

1157
01:42:58,417 --> 01:43:01,292
- For Christ's sake!
- He's played before.

1158
01:43:01,458 --> 01:43:03,792
- He can hardly do worse.
- Two numbers.

1159
01:43:03,917 --> 01:43:06,792
I'd piss on a spark plug
if I thought it'd do any good.

1160
01:43:06,958 --> 01:43:09,625
- Let the boy in there, Major.
- List games.

1161
01:43:15,667 --> 01:43:17,292
Chess.

1162
01:43:24,542 --> 01:43:26,125
Three numbers locked in.

1163
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:27,583
Poker.

1164
01:43:30,250 --> 01:43:33,750
Security system's
not gonna let anything through.

1165
01:43:36,167 --> 01:43:38,208
Global thermonuclear war.

1166
01:43:46,875 --> 01:43:48,458
Four numbers.

1167
01:43:50,917 --> 01:43:53,333
Stephen, for Christ's sake. Do something.

1168
01:43:53,458 --> 01:43:55,833
- Come on, kid. Let's go.
- No. Try again.

1169
01:43:58,792 --> 01:44:01,125
- Put the list back up.
- We already tried that.

1170
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:03,083
- Put it up!
- Yes, put it up.

1171
01:44:11,083 --> 01:44:14,000
- It's not on the list!
- What's not on the list?

1172
01:44:14,125 --> 01:44:16,042
Go ahead. It's got to be somewhere.

1173
01:44:18,958 --> 01:44:22,167
Tic-tac-toe.

1174
01:44:28,292 --> 01:44:31,042
You're in. Order it to disarm the missiles.

1175
01:44:31,167 --> 01:44:32,333
No! No.

1176
01:44:42,208 --> 01:44:44,500
Five numbers. It's got half the code.

1177
01:44:46,083 --> 01:44:47,875
One.

1178
01:44:49,417 --> 01:44:51,417
- Put X in the center square.
- I know.

1179
01:45:02,542 --> 01:45:04,792
- Six up.
- There's no way you can win.

1180
01:45:04,917 --> 01:45:08,000
I know that. It doesn't. It hasn't learned.

1181
01:45:08,125 --> 01:45:12,792
- Is there any way to make it play itself?
- Yes. Number of players zero.

1182
01:45:33,708 --> 01:45:35,125
Seven!

1183
01:45:35,250 --> 01:45:37,833
Come on. Learn, goddamn it.

1184
01:45:50,708 --> 01:45:51,833
Eight.

1185
01:45:51,958 --> 01:45:56,500
It must be caught in a loop. It's taking
power from the rest of the system.

1186
01:45:57,542 --> 01:45:59,417
Nine numbers.

1187
01:46:03,250 --> 01:46:06,333
Ten! It's got the code. It's going to launch.

1188
01:46:24,750 --> 01:46:27,667
Colonel Conley, call SAC.
Get me a launch status report.

1189
01:46:30,292 --> 01:46:32,250
Major Davis, get me the president.

1190
01:47:05,208 --> 01:47:06,708
How you doin', Colonel?

1191
01:47:06,833 --> 01:47:10,333
Land lines out of the mountain are dead.
I'm trying satellites.

1192
01:47:35,667 --> 01:47:38,583
- What's it doing?
- It's learning.

1193
01:48:25,958 --> 01:48:28,667
Greetings, Professor Falken.

1194
01:48:37,625 --> 01:48:40,292
Hello, Joshua.

1195
01:48:41,083 --> 01:48:42,958
Strange game.

1196
01:48:43,083 --> 01:48:46,417
The only winning move is not to play.

1197
01:48:54,417 --> 01:48:57,708
How about a nice game of chess?

1198
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:37,875
Colonel Conley, take us to DEFCON 5.

1199
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,042
Yes, sir.

1200
01:52:41,542 --> 01:52:43,833
