1
00:01:57,202 --> 00:01:58,536
Dismount!

2
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:06,878
Herman's horse-sick!

3
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:16,387
Chaps, no one wander off.

4
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:20,350
Some of the passageways
in here can run for miles.

5
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,321
I don't think this is such a good idea.

6
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:39,202
What is it?

7
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:06,688
- Alfred, did you get anything yet?
- Nothing.

8
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:07,772
Then keep digging.

9
00:03:07,856 --> 00:03:09,816
The kid's got something!

10
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:13,528
I got something, Garth!
I got something...

11
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:15,363
I got something right here.

12
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:23,413
Look at that!

13
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:26,332
- We're rich! We're rich!
- Shut up. Shut up.

14
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,501
Well, we're rich, isn’t we?

15
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:31,838
Indy...

16
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:33,965
Indy?

17
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,551
What are they doing?

18
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:39,095
Indiana? Indiana?

19
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,311
Hey, we got to find
more stuff to bring back.

20
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:48,438
It's the Cross of Coronado.

21
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,482
Cortez gave it to him in 1520.

22
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:52,817
Ch, boy!

23
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:57,822
I'm thinking' about raisin' my dead mama,
dig down and put it on her bony finger!

24
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:01,993
That cross is an important artifact.
It belongs in a museum.

25
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:04,454
Run back and find the others.

26
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:06,998
Tell Mr. Havelock
that there are men looting in the caves.

27
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:10,251
Have him bring the sheriff.
It's only a snake.

28
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:11,836
Did you hear what I said?

29
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,421
Right. Run back...

30
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,673
Mr. Havelock... The sheriff...

31
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:17,759
What, what are you going to do?

32
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:19,302
I don't know.

33
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:20,929
I'll think of something.

34
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:28,895
Dig with your hands,
not with your mouth.

35
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:45,411
He's got our thing!

36
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:47,205
- Get him!
- Get off me!

37
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:54,879
Mr. Havelock! Anybody!

38
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:57,256
Everybody's lost but me.

39
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,884
There he is! Let's go! Let's go!

40
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,569
'Hey! Hey, you!
- Dang it!

41
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:25,243
Hey! Come back here!

42
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:40,591
Come on! Get him!

43
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:50,560
Hey, come back here!

44
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:58,503
Here, let me.

45
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,126
Holy smokes!

46
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,359
Come on, kid.

47
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:07,822
There's no way out of this.

48
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:20,918
Hey!

49
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,023
Toss up the whip.

50
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,619
You got heart, kid,
but that belongs to me.

51
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:56,120
It belongs to Coronado.

52
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:58,539
Coronado is dead,
and so are all of his grandchildren.

53
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,042
This should be in a museum.

54
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,793
Now give it back!

55
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:07,798
A snake! Snake!

56
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:10,134
Don't let him get away!

57
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:12,470
Magic?

58
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:15,598
Hold it.

59
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:17,475
Make sure he doesn't double back.

60
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:36,661
Okay, kid, out of the box, now.

61
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:39,372
Son of a...

62
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,176
Damn.

63
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:04,689
Dad!

64
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:07,942
Dad!

65
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:10,736
Dad.

66
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,322
- Dad...
- Out.

67
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:15,866
- It's important.
- Then wait. Count to 20.

68
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,452
- No, Dad. You listen to me.
- Junior!

69
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:19,870
One, two, three, four...

70
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:21,747
In Greek.

71
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:38,973
"May he who illuminated this,
illuminate me. "

72
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:46,939
I brought the sheriff.

73
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:50,151
Just the man I want to see.

74
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:51,402
Now, there were five or six of them...

75
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:52,987
- It's all right, son.
- They came after me...

76
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,448
- You still got it?
- Well, yes, sir.

77
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:56,741
It's right here.

78
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,118
I'm glad to see that

79
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:04,582
because the rightful owner of this cross
won't press charges if you give it back.

80
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,836
He's got witnesses, five or six of them.

81
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,098
Yeah!

82
00:11:32,443 --> 00:11:33,736
Good day.

83
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:40,242
You lost today, kid,

84
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:44,205
but it doesn't mean you have to like it.

85
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:12,733
Small world, Dr. Jones.

86
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:14,902
Too small for two of us.

87
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,579
This is the second time
I've had to reclaim

88
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:26,956
my property from you.

89
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,166
That belongs in a museum.

90
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:31,627
So do you.

91
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:34,213
Throw him over the side.

92
00:13:22,428 --> 00:13:24,054
Grab him, he's getting away! Stop him!

93
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:22,363
Archaeology is the search for fact...

94
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,575
...not truth.

95
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:27,993
If it's truth you're interested in,

96
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:31,121
Dr. Tyree's philosophy class
is right down the hall.

97
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:35,459
So forget any ideas you've got about
lost cities, exotic travel,

98
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:36,961
and digging up the world.

99
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,879
We do not follow maps
to buried treasure,

100
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:42,007
and "X" never, ever, marks the spot.

101
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:49,139
Seventy percent of all archaeology
is done in the library.

102
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:51,016
Research. Reading.

103
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,647
We cannot afford to take mythology
at face value.

104
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,150
Next week, Egyptology

105
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:04,071
starting with the excavation of Naukratis
by Flinders Petrie in 1885.

106
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:06,865
I will be in my office
if anybody's got any problems,

107
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:09,159
for the next hour and a half.

108
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:16,709
Marcus, I did it.

109
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,669
You've got it!

110
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,432
You know how long I've
been looking for that?

111
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:33,017
All your life.

112
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,393
All my life.

113
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:37,187
Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed.

114
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,358
This will find a place of honour
in our Spanish collection.

115
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:45,362
We can discuss my honorarium
over dinner and champagne tonight.

116
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,489
- Your treat.
- Yes.

117
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:50,034
My treat.

118
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,205
- Dr. Jones!
- Dr. Jones!

119
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:03,964
Dr. Jones, I am so glad you're back.

120
00:16:04,048 --> 00:16:05,883
Your mail is on your desk.
Here are your phone messages.

121
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:06,967
Dr. Jones, you promised...

122
00:16:07,051 --> 00:16:08,135
This is your appointment schedule,

123
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,554
and these term papers
still haven't been graded.

124
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,973
Okay. Irene, put everybody's name
on a list,

125
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:14,183
get the order they arrived...

126
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,101
- Oh, come on, Dr. Jones.
- Dr. Jones.

127
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:20,356
...And I'll see each and
every one of them in turn.

128
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,994
Venice, Italy

129
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:36,038
Dr. Jones!

130
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:04,692
Dr. Jones?

131
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:11,990
Dr. Jones.

132
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:31,260
I trust your trip down
was comfortable, Dr. Jones.

133
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:34,513
My men didn't alarm you, I hope.

134
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:37,683
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.

135
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,476
I know who you are, Mr. Donovan.

136
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,061
Your contributions to the museum
over the years

137
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:42,604
have been extremely generous.

138
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:44,898
Some of the pieces in your collection
here are very impressive.

139
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:48,986
Well, like yourself, Dr. Jones,
I have a passion for antiquities.

140
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,155
Have a look over here.

141
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,491
This might interest you.

142
00:17:57,828 --> 00:18:00,998
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol.

143
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,417
Early Latin text.

144
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:05,753
Mid-12th century, I should think.

145
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,671
That was our assessment, as well.

146
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:08,839
Where did this come from?

147
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,884
My engineers unearthed it
in the mountain region north of Ankara

148
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:14,178
while excavating for copper.

149
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,764
Can you translate the inscription?

150
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:23,562
"... Who drinks the water
I shall give him, says the Lord,

151
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,607
"will have a spring inside him

152
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,568
"welling up for eternal life.

153
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:33,322
"Let them bring me
to your holy mountain

154
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:35,532
"in the place where you dwell.

155
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:38,535
"Across the desert
and through the mountain

156
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:42,039
"to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon,

157
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,584
"to the temple where the cup that...

158
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:53,091
"Where the cup that holds the blood
of Jesus Christ resides forever. "

159
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,262
The Holy Grail, Dr. Jones.

160
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:01,809
The chalice used by Christ
during the Last Supper.

161
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:05,646
The cup that caught His blood
at the Crucifixion

162
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:08,649
and was entrusted to
Joseph of Arimathea.

163
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,485
The Arthur legend.

164
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,987
I've heard this bedtime story before.

165
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,864
Eternal life, Dr. Jones!

166
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:18,700
The gift of youth
to whoever drinks from the Grail.

167
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:21,161
Now, that's a bedtime story
I'd like to wake up to.

168
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:22,496
An old man's dream.

169
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:26,041
Every man's dream,
including your father's, I believe.

170
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,172
Grail lore is his hobby.

171
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,841
He's a teacher of medieval literature.

172
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:35,759
The one the students hope
they don't get.

173
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:39,221
Walter, you're neglecting your guests.

174
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,431
Be along in a moment, dear.

175
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,730
Hard to resist, isn't it?

176
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:52,401
The Holy Grail's final resting place
described in detail.

177
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,319
What good is it?

178
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:58,198
This Grail tablet speaks of deserts
and mountains and canyons.

179
00:19:58,448 --> 00:19:59,700
It's pretty vague.

180
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:01,410
Where do you want to start looking?

181
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:03,829
Maybe if the tablet were intact,
you'd have something to go on,

182
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,539
but the entire top portion is missing.

183
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:08,959
Just the same, an attempt to recover
the Grail is currently underway.

184
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:14,923
Let me tell you another
bedtime story, Dr. Jones.

185
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,051
After the Grail was entrusted
to Joseph of Arimathea,

186
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:21,013
it disappeared,
and was lost for a thousand years

187
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:24,850
before it was found again
by three knights of the First Crusade.

188
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,393
Three brothers, to be exact.

189
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,478
I've heard this one, as well.

190
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,606
Two of these brothers
walked out of the desert

191
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,734
150 years after having found the Grail

192
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,861
and began the long journey
back to France,

193
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,988
but only one of them made it.

194
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:41,450
And before dying of extreme old age,

195
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:46,163
he supposedly imparted his tale to a...
to a Franciscan friar, I think.

196
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,999
Not "supposedly," Dr. Jones.

197
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:54,129
This is the manuscript in which
the friar chronicled the knight's story.

198
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,174
It doesn't reveal the location of
the Grail, I'm afraid,

199
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:59,051
but the knight promised
that two markers

200
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:00,677
that had been left behind would.

201
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:04,389
This tablet is one of those markers.

202
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:06,683
It proves the knight's story is true.

203
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:09,353
But as you pointed out, it's incomplete.

204
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,397
Now, the second marker is entombed
with the knight's dead brother.

205
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,567
Our project leader
believes that tomb to be located

206
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:18,320
within the city of Venice, Italy.

207
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,783
As you can now see, Dr. Jones,

208
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,869
we're about to complete a great quest

209
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:28,997
that began almost 2,000 years ago.

210
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,458
We're only one step away.

211
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,711
That's usually when the ground falls out
from underneath your feet.

212
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,422
You could be more right than you know.

213
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:38,799
Yes?

214
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:40,717
We've hit a snag.

215
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:45,764
Our project leader has vanished,
along with all his research.

216
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:49,351
We received a cable from his colleague,
Dr. Schneider,

217
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:53,146
who has no idea of his whereabouts
or what's become of him.

218
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:56,900
I want you to pick up the trail
where he left off.

219
00:21:57,275 --> 00:22:00,070
Find the man,
and you will find the Grail.

220
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:04,408
You've got the wrong Jones,
Mr. Donovan.

221
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:08,203
Why don't you try my father?

222
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:10,080
We already have.

223
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:13,125
Your father is the man
who has disappeared.

224
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:27,014
Your father and I have been friends
since time began.

225
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:28,306
I've watched you grow up, Indy.

226
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,100
I've watched the two of you grow apart.

227
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,185
I've never seen you this concerned
about him before.

228
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:33,395
Dad?

229
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,605
He's an academic, a bookworm.
He's not a field man.

230
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:36,773
Dad?

231
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:38,442
Dad?

232
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,193
Dear God.

233
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,324
What has the old fool
got himself into now?

234
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:50,412
I don't know, but whatever it is,
he's in over his head.

235
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:52,164
Dad?

236
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:55,500
It's today's mail, and it's been opened.

237
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,171
Mail.

238
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,465
That's it, Marcus.

239
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:05,427
Venice, Italy.

240
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:10,140
What is it?

241
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,312
It's Dad's Grail diary.

242
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,317
Every clue he followed.
Every discovery he made.

243
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,903
A complete record of his search
for the Holy Grail.

244
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:26,573
This is his whole life.

245
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:29,659
Why would he have sent this to me?

246
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,161
I don't know,

247
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,872
but someone must want it pretty badly.

248
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:45,926
Do you believe, Marcus?

249
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:00,816
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?

250
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:06,780
The search for the Cup of Christ
is the search for the divine in all of us.

251
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:09,866
But if you want facts, Indy,
I've none to give you.

252
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:14,454
At my age, I'm prepared to
take a few things on faith.

253
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:21,545
Call Donovan, Marcus.

254
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:24,548
Tell him I'll take that ticket
to Venice now.

255
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:28,218
I'll tell him we'll take two

256
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:35,976
All right, tell me what's going to happen
when we get to Venice.

257
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,019
Don't worry, Dr. Schneider
will be there to meet you.

258
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:39,521
- Schneider?
- I maintain an apartment in Venice.

259
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:40,647
It's at your disposal.

260
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,649
Oh, well, that's good. Thank you.

261
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:47,070
Dr. Jones, good luck.

262
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:50,907
Now be very careful.
Don't trust anybody.

263
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:27,027
Signora? Signorina?

264
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:37,454
- Ah, Venice...
- Yes.

265
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,625
How will we recognize
this Dr. Schneider when we see him?

266
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,753
I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.

267
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:46,171
Dr. Jones?

268
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:48,965
Yes?

269
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,301
I knew it was you.

270
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:54,137
You have your father's eyes.

271
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:59,434
And my mother's ears,
but the rest belongs to you.

272
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,687
Looks like the best parts
have already been spoken for.

273
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:05,690
- Marcus Brody?
- That's right.

274
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:07,525
Dr. Elsa Schneider.

275
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:08,777
How do you do?

276
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:12,656
The last time I saw your father,
we were in the library.

277
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:15,242
He was very close to tracking down
the knight's tomb.

278
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:17,202
I've never seen him so excited.

279
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:19,621
He was as giddy as a schoolboy.

280
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,706
Who? Attila the Professor?

281
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,960
He was never giddy,
even when he was a schoolboy.

282
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,671
FrÃ©ulein, will you permit me?

283
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:29,756
- I usually don't.
- I usually don't, either.

284
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,259
- In that case, I permit you.
- It would make me very happy.

285
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:34,678
But I'm already sad.
By tomorrow, it will have faded.

286
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:35,762
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.

287
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:38,181
I hate to interrupt you,
but the reason we're here...

288
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:40,225
Yes. I have something to show you.

289
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:42,102
I left your father working in the library.

290
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:45,272
He sent me to the map section
to fetch an ancient plan of the city.

291
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:48,191
When I got back to his table,
he'd gone, with all his papers,

292
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:50,777
except for that scrap,
which I found near his chair.

293
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,861
Roman numerals.

294
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,239
Here is the library.

295
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:57,242
That doesn't look much like a library.

296
00:26:57,492 --> 00:26:59,452
Looks like a converted church.

297
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:01,621
In this case, it's the literal truth.

298
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:03,456
We are on holy ground.

299
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,168
These columns over here
were brought back as spoils of war

300
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:10,547
after the sacking of Byzantium
during the Crusades.

301
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:13,508
Now, please excuse me.

302
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:15,302
The library's closing in a few moments.

303
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:18,346
I'll arrange for us to stay a little longer.

304
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:24,561
Marcus, I've seen this window before.

305
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:25,645
Where?

306
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:27,897
Right here, in Dad's diary.

307
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:37,657
You see?

308
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:40,535
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals.

309
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:43,288
Dad was onto something here.

310
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,206
Well, now we know
the source of the numbers,

311
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,250
but we still don't know what they mean.

312
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:48,835
Dad sent me this diary for a reason.

313
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:51,629
Until we find out why,
I suggest we keep it to ourselves.

314
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:52,922
Find something?

315
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:55,008
Yes. Three, seven and ten.

316
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,594
That window seems to be
the source of the Roman numerals.

317
00:27:57,677 --> 00:27:59,262
My God, I must be blind.

318
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:02,515
Dad wasn't looking for a book
about the knight's tomb,

319
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,559
he was looking for the tomb itself.

320
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:05,977
Don't you get it?

321
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:08,021
The tomb is somewhere in the library.

322
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:10,023
You said yourself it used to be a church.

323
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:11,232
Look.

324
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:12,692
Three.

325
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:16,196
Three.

326
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:17,739
Seven.

327
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:19,366
Seven. Ten.

328
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:22,285
And ten.

329
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,162
Now where's the ten?

330
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,791
Look around for the ten.

331
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,593
Three and seven.

332
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:40,762
Seven and seven

333
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:42,806
and ten.

334
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:04,494
Ten.

335
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:08,331
"X" marks the spot.

336
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:07,056
Bingo.

337
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,725
You don't disappoint, Dr. Jones.

338
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:10,351
You're a great deal like your father.

339
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:11,978
Except he's lost, and I'm not.

340
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:13,563
Lower me down.

341
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:26,034
Look after this for me, will you?

342
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:41,090
Come on.

343
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:51,601
Pagan symbols. Fourth or fifth century.

344
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:52,769
Right.

345
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:55,313
600 years before the Crusades.

346
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:57,899
The Christians would have
dug their own passages

347
00:30:57,982 --> 00:31:00,193
and burial chambers centuries later.

348
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:01,236
That's right.

349
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,863
If there's a knight of
the First Crusade down here,

350
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:05,448
that's where we'll find him.

351
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:39,399
What's this one?

352
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:40,942
The Ark of the Covenant.

353
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:43,111
- Are you sure?
- Pretty sure.

354
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:02,171
Watch out.

355
00:32:17,562 --> 00:32:18,771
It's petroleum.

356
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:21,691
I should sink a well down here
and retire.

357
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:40,043
Give me the lighter.

358
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:51,888
Oh, rats.

359
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:09,572
Come on.

360
00:33:58,454 --> 00:33:59,872
Come here.

361
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:10,925
Look, it... it must be one of these.

362
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,138
Look at the artistry of these carvings,
and the scrollwork.

363
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:33,114
It's this one.

364
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:51,257
This is it. We found it.

365
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:56,012
Look.

366
00:34:56,846 --> 00:35:01,017
The engraving on the shield,
it's the same as on the Grail tablet.

367
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:05,354
The shield is the second marker.

368
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:07,148
What's that?

369
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:10,276
It's a rubbing Dad made
of the Grail tablet.

370
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:15,281
Just like your father,
giddy as a schoolboy.

371
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,951
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if he were here now to see this?

372
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:23,206
He never would have
made it past the rats.

373
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:24,540
He hates rats.

374
00:35:24,624 --> 00:35:26,375
He's scared to death of them.

375
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,316
Get back! Back against the wall.

376
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:57,156
Quick! Under it! Air pocket!

377
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:05,289
- Don't wander off.
- What?

378
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:06,791
What?

379
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,854
I think I've found a way out.

380
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:29,313
Deep breath.

381
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:48,583
Ah, Venice.

382
00:37:54,649 --> 00:37:56,692
Are you crazy? Don't go between them!

383
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:59,195
Go between them? Are you crazy?

384
00:38:10,498 --> 00:38:12,208
I said go around!

385
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,335
You said go between them!

386
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:17,046
I said, don't go between them!

387
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:20,443
No!

388
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:27,450
Why are you trying to kill us?

389
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:29,410
Because you're looking
for the Holy Grail.

390
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:33,122
My father was looking for the Holy Grail.
Did you kill him too?

391
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:34,206
No.

392
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,125
Where is he?

393
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:38,252
Talk or you're dead.

394
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:39,962
Damn it, tell me!

395
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:41,797
Tell me!

396
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:44,425
If you don't let go, Dr. Jones,
we'll both die.

397
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:46,010
Then we'll die.

398
00:39:46,177 --> 00:39:48,929
My soul is prepared. How's yours?

399
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,224
This is your last chance.

400
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:54,560
No, Dr. Jones, it's yours.

401
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,621
All right, where's my father?

402
00:40:13,704 --> 00:40:16,540
If you let me go,
I will tell you where he is.

403
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:18,501
Who are you?

404
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:20,503
My name is Kazim.

405
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:22,088
And why were you trying to kill me?

406
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:26,842
The secret of the Grail has been safe
for a thousand years,

407
00:40:27,176 --> 00:40:28,928
and for all that time,

408
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:30,971
the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword

409
00:40:31,055 --> 00:40:34,266
have been prepared
to do anything to keep it safe.

410
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:38,854
Let me off at this jetty.

411
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:46,362
Ask yourself, why do you
seek the Cup of Christ?

412
00:40:47,196 --> 00:40:49,824
Is it for His glory, or for yours?

413
00:40:51,075 --> 00:40:54,537
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ.
I came to find my father.

414
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:58,791
In that case,
God be with you in your quest.

415
00:40:58,874 --> 00:41:01,043
Your father is being held
in the Castle of Brunwald,

416
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:03,379
on the Austrian-German border.

417
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:13,514
How's the head?

418
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:16,016
It's better, now I've seen this.

419
00:41:17,143 --> 00:41:20,187
It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta"?

420
00:41:23,941 --> 00:41:25,192
The knights of the First Crusade

421
00:41:25,276 --> 00:41:28,571
laid siege to the city
of Alexandretta for over a year.

422
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:30,906
The entire city was destroyed.

423
00:41:33,826 --> 00:41:37,246
The present city of Iskenderun
is built on its ruins.

424
00:41:38,581 --> 00:41:41,584
Marcus, you remember
what the Grail tablet said,

425
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:43,335
"Across the desert
and through the mountain

426
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:46,005
"to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon. "

427
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:50,676
But where exactly?

428
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:52,636
Your father would know.

429
00:41:54,597 --> 00:41:57,558
Your father did know.
Look. He made a map.

430
00:41:58,267 --> 00:42:00,227
He must have pieced it together
from clues scattered through

431
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:02,479
the whole history of the Grail quest.

432
00:42:02,563 --> 00:42:03,564
A map with no names.

433
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:07,443
Now, he knew there was a city
with an oasis due east, here.

434
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:10,362
He knew the course turned south
through the desert to a river,

435
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:12,281
and the river led
into the mountains, here.

436
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:13,657
Straight to the canyon.

437
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:16,243
He knew everything
except where to begin,

438
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:18,120
the name of the city.

439
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:21,373
Alexandretta.

440
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:24,043
- Now we know.
- Yes. Now we know.

441
00:42:24,126 --> 00:42:26,712
Marcus, get hold of Sallah.
Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.

442
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:28,297
What about you?

443
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,423
I'm going after Dad.

444
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:52,529
Elsa?

445
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:00,162
Elsa? Elsa?

446
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,968
- My room...
- Mine, too.

447
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:16,345
What were they looking for?

448
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:17,513
This.

449
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,515
The Grail diary?

450
00:43:21,183 --> 00:43:22,518
You had it?

451
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,145
You didn't trust me.

452
00:43:25,229 --> 00:43:26,897
I didn't know you.

453
00:43:27,273 --> 00:43:29,483
At least I let you tag along.

454
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:30,776
Oh, yes.

455
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:33,779
Give them a flower,
and they'll follow you anywhere.

456
00:43:35,406 --> 00:43:37,616
Knock it off. You're not mad.

457
00:43:38,075 --> 00:43:39,201
No?

458
00:43:39,285 --> 00:43:41,912
No. You like the way I do things.

459
00:43:41,996 --> 00:43:43,956
It's lucky I don't do things the same way.

460
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:46,834
You'd still be standing
at the Venice pier!

461
00:43:47,126 --> 00:43:50,129
Look, what do you think
is going on here?

462
00:43:50,212 --> 00:43:52,673
Since I met you,
I've nearly been incinerated,

463
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:55,217
drowned, shot at,
and chopped into fish bait.

464
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:56,802
We're caught in the middle
of something sinister here.

465
00:43:56,885 --> 00:43:59,847
My guess is Dad found out
more than he was looking for.

466
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:03,225
And until I'm sure,
I'm going to continue to do things

467
00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:05,894
the way I think they should be done.

468
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:10,899
How dare you kiss me!

469
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:20,326
Leave me alone. I don't like fast women.

470
00:44:21,577 --> 00:44:24,496
And I hate arrogant men.

471
00:44:34,965 --> 00:44:36,508
Ah, Venice.

472
00:45:08,832 --> 00:45:10,501
What do you know about this place?

473
00:45:10,584 --> 00:45:13,670
I know the Brunwalds
are famous art collectors.

474
00:45:16,215 --> 00:45:17,758
What are you going to do?

475
00:45:17,925 --> 00:45:20,302
Don't know. I'll think of something.

476
00:45:28,018 --> 00:45:29,019
Yes?

477
00:45:29,103 --> 00:45:30,896
And not before time!

478
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:33,440
Did you intend to leave us
standing on the doorstep all day?

479
00:45:33,524 --> 00:45:35,067
We're drenched!

480
00:45:36,068 --> 00:45:38,904
Now look, I've gone and caught a sniffle.

481
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:40,239
Are you expected?

482
00:45:40,322 --> 00:45:43,075
Do not take that tone with me,
my good man.

483
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:44,993
Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald

484
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,664
that Lord Clarence MacDonald
and his lovely assistant

485
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:51,083
are here to view the tapestries.

486
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:52,334
Tapestries?

487
00:45:52,418 --> 00:45:53,919
Dear me, the man is dense.

488
00:45:54,002 --> 00:45:57,297
This is a castle, isn't it?
There are tapestries?

489
00:45:57,881 --> 00:45:59,716
This is a castle,

490
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,344
and we have many tapestries.

491
00:46:02,886 --> 00:46:06,640
But if you are a Scottish lord,
then I am Mickey Mouse!

492
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,518
How dare he?

493
00:46:36,587 --> 00:46:39,131
Nazis. I hate these guys.

494
00:46:52,603 --> 00:46:54,229
This one. I think he's in here.

495
00:46:54,313 --> 00:46:55,981
How do you know?

496
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:57,816
Because it's wired.

497
00:47:25,928 --> 00:47:28,096
Indy?Indy?

498
00:47:28,597 --> 00:47:30,599
Don't worry. This is kid's play.

499
00:47:30,682 --> 00:47:32,476
I'll be right back.

500
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:58,293
Junior?

501
00:47:59,586 --> 00:48:00,671
Yes, sir.

502
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:02,714
It is you, Junior!

503
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,217
Don't call me that, please.

504
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,635
Well, what are you doing here?

505
00:48:06,885 --> 00:48:09,513
I came to get you. What do you thi...

506
00:48:18,981 --> 00:48:21,316
Late 14th century, Ming dynasty.

507
00:48:22,526 --> 00:48:23,944
It breaks the heart.

508
00:48:24,027 --> 00:48:26,363
And the head. You hit me, Dad.

509
00:48:26,446 --> 00:48:28,490
I'll never forgive myself.

510
00:48:29,032 --> 00:48:30,909
Don't worry, I'm fine.

511
00:48:32,828 --> 00:48:34,162
Thank God.

512
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:38,625
It's fake.

513
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:43,046
See, you can tell by the cross section.

514
00:48:44,506 --> 00:48:46,008
No!

515
00:48:46,133 --> 00:48:48,635
Dad, get your stuff.
We've got to get out of here.

516
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:52,806
Well, I'm sorry about your head, though,
but I thought you were one of them.

517
00:48:52,889 --> 00:48:55,517
Dad, they come in through the doors.

518
00:48:56,184 --> 00:48:57,436
Good point.

519
00:48:58,312 --> 00:48:59,855
But better safe than sorry.

520
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:01,940
So I was wrong this time.

521
00:49:02,024 --> 00:49:05,485
But, by God, I wasn't wrong
when I mailed you my diary.

522
00:49:05,569 --> 00:49:06,695
You obviously got it.

523
00:49:09,531 --> 00:49:11,491
I got it, and I used it.

524
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:14,661
We found the entrance
to the catacombs.

525
00:49:14,745 --> 00:49:16,246
Through the library?

526
00:49:16,913 --> 00:49:18,081
Right.

527
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:22,878
I knew it.

528
00:49:23,295 --> 00:49:24,880
And the tomb of Sir Richard?

529
00:49:26,548 --> 00:49:27,799
Found it

530
00:49:29,301 --> 00:49:31,178
He was actually there?

531
00:49:33,722 --> 00:49:35,349
You saw him?

532
00:49:35,432 --> 00:49:37,559
Well, what was left of him.

533
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:39,603
And his shield,

534
00:49:40,479 --> 00:49:43,398
the inscription on Sir Richard's shield?

535
00:49:44,483 --> 00:49:45,776
"Alexandretta. "

536
00:49:45,859 --> 00:49:48,737
Alexandretta! Of course!

537
00:49:49,738 --> 00:49:52,908
On the pilgrim trail
from the Eastern Empire.

538
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:57,663
Junior, you did it.

539
00:49:58,288 --> 00:49:59,915
No, Dad. You did.

540
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:01,667
Forty years.

541
00:50:02,959 --> 00:50:05,295
If only I could have been with you.

542
00:50:05,379 --> 00:50:07,172
There were rats, Dad.

543
00:50:07,881 --> 00:50:08,965
Rats?

544
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:10,467
Yeah, big ones.

545
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,177
What do the Nazis want with you, Dad?

546
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,763
- They wanted my diary.
- Yeah?

547
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:19,393
I knew I had to get that book
as far away from me as I possibly could.

548
00:50:22,354 --> 00:50:23,397
Yeah.

549
00:50:28,235 --> 00:50:29,569
Dr. Jones.

550
00:50:29,695 --> 00:50:30,779
Yes?

551
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:35,784
I will take the book now.

552
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:39,246
What book?

553
00:50:39,538 --> 00:50:41,748
You have the diary in your pocket.

554
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:44,543
You dolt!

555
00:50:44,876 --> 00:50:47,337
Do you think my son
would be that stupid

556
00:50:47,421 --> 00:50:50,799
that he would bring my diary
all the way back here?

557
00:50:52,342 --> 00:50:53,844
You didn't, did you?

558
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:57,222
- You didn't bring it, did you?
- Well...

559
00:50:57,639 --> 00:50:59,182
You did.

560
00:50:59,558 --> 00:51:01,226
Look, can we discuss this later?

561
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:03,353
I should have mailed it
to the Marx Brothers.

562
00:51:03,437 --> 00:51:04,980
Will you take it easy?

563
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:06,481
Take it easy?

564
00:51:06,565 --> 00:51:08,567
Why do you think I sent it home
in the first place?

565
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,235
So it wouldn't fall into their hands!

566
00:51:10,402 --> 00:51:12,320
I came here to save you!

567
00:51:12,404 --> 00:51:13,405
Oh, yeah?

568
00:51:13,488 --> 00:51:15,907
And who's going to come
to save you, Junior?

569
00:51:15,991 --> 00:51:17,200
I told you...

570
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:26,668
...don't call me Junior!

571
00:51:29,337 --> 00:51:31,006
Look what you did!

572
00:51:32,674 --> 00:51:34,968
I can't believe what you did...

573
00:51:37,387 --> 00:51:39,055
Elsa? Elsa?

574
00:51:39,139 --> 00:51:41,308
That's far enough.
Put down the gun, Dr. Jones.

575
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:43,435
Put down the gun, or the FrÃ©ulein dies.

576
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,812
- But she's one of them.
- Indy, please!

577
00:51:45,979 --> 00:51:47,773
- She's a Nazi.
- What?

578
00:51:47,856 --> 00:51:49,107
- Trust me.
- Indy,no!

579
00:51:49,191 --> 00:51:50,192
I will kill her!

580
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:52,986
- Yeah? Go ahead!
- No! Don't shoot!

581
00:51:53,779 --> 00:51:55,197
Don't worry. He won't.

582
00:51:55,989 --> 00:51:57,783
Indy, please! Do what he says!

583
00:51:57,866 --> 00:51:59,785
And don't listen to her.

584
00:51:59,868 --> 00:52:01,620
Enough! She dies!

585
00:52:01,787 --> 00:52:03,246
Wait! Wait...

586
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,214
I'm sorry.

587
00:52:12,672 --> 00:52:15,050
No, don't be.

588
00:52:28,647 --> 00:52:31,650
But you should have
listened to your father.

589
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:52,671
She ransacked her own room,
and I fell for it.

590
00:52:54,881 --> 00:52:57,217
How did you know she was a Nazi?

591
00:52:58,552 --> 00:53:00,887
How did you know she was a Nazi?

592
00:53:01,096 --> 00:53:03,014
She talks in her sleep.

593
00:53:13,108 --> 00:53:15,360
I didn't trust her. Why did you?

594
00:53:15,652 --> 00:53:18,238
Because he didn't take my advice.

595
00:53:24,995 --> 00:53:26,746
Donovan.

596
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:30,625
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody,
Dr. Jones?

597
00:53:30,876 --> 00:53:33,211
I misjudged you, Walter.

598
00:53:33,295 --> 00:53:36,381
I knew you would sell your mother
for an Etruscan vase,

599
00:53:36,464 --> 00:53:39,926
but I didn't know you would
sell your country and your soul

600
00:53:40,302 --> 00:53:41,970
to the slime of humanity.

601
00:53:43,889 --> 00:53:45,473
Dr. Schneider,

602
00:53:45,557 --> 00:53:48,143
there are pages torn out of this.

603
00:53:56,818 --> 00:54:00,989
This book contained a map,
a map with no names,

604
00:54:01,072 --> 00:54:03,199
precise directions from the unknown city

605
00:54:03,283 --> 00:54:05,201
to the secret
Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

606
00:54:05,285 --> 00:54:06,286
So it did.

607
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:08,121
Where are these missing pages,
this map?

608
00:54:08,204 --> 00:54:09,581
We must have these pages back.

609
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:10,916
You're wasting your breath.

610
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:12,792
He won't tell us,

611
00:54:12,876 --> 00:54:14,711
and he doesn't have to.

612
00:54:15,378 --> 00:54:18,340
It's perfectly obvious
where the pages are.

613
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,842
He's given them to Marcus Brody.

614
00:54:20,926 --> 00:54:21,968
Marcus?

615
00:54:22,344 --> 00:54:24,429
You didn't drag poor Marcus along,
did you?

616
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:25,931
He's not up to the challenge.

617
00:54:26,014 --> 00:54:27,474
He sticks out like a sore thumb.

618
00:54:27,557 --> 00:54:28,683
We'll find him.

619
00:54:28,767 --> 00:54:30,435
The hell you will.

620
00:54:30,518 --> 00:54:32,187
He's got a two-day head start on you,

621
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:33,688
which is more than he needs.

622
00:54:34,189 --> 00:54:36,107
Brody's got friends
in every town and village

623
00:54:36,191 --> 00:54:37,275
from here to the Sudan.

624
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,028
He speaks a dozen languages,
knows every local custom.

625
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:41,947
He'll blend in, disappear.

626
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:43,865
You'll never see him again.

627
00:54:43,949 --> 00:54:46,534
With any luck,
he's got the Grail already.

628
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:49,788
Does anyone here speak English?

629
00:54:49,871 --> 00:54:50,956
Or even ancient Greek?

630
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:52,207
Water? No, thank you, sir.

631
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:53,625
No. Fish make love in it.

632
00:54:54,542 --> 00:54:56,962
Goodness me. Thank you so much.
No, I don't like that.

633
00:54:57,045 --> 00:54:58,213
No, I really don't want...

634
00:54:58,296 --> 00:55:00,465
No, no, thank you very much.

635
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:02,550
No, thank you, madam. I'm a vegetarian.

636
00:55:03,051 --> 00:55:05,762
Does anyone understand
a word I'm saying here?

637
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:07,305
Mr. Brody!

638
00:55:07,389 --> 00:55:08,556
Sallah. What a relief.

639
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,976
Marcus Brody, sir.

640
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:12,769
- But where is Indy?
- He's in Austria.

641
00:55:12,852 --> 00:55:14,312
A slight detour.

642
00:55:14,396 --> 00:55:15,438
You are on your own?

643
00:55:15,522 --> 00:55:18,233
Yes, but don't panic.
Everything's under control.

644
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:20,568
Have you, have you
arranged our supplies?

645
00:55:20,652 --> 00:55:22,487
Yes, of course.
But where are we going?

646
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:24,030
This map will show you.

647
00:55:24,114 --> 00:55:26,074
It was drawn by...

648
00:55:26,574 --> 00:55:27,993
Mr. Brody.

649
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:29,911
Welcome to Iskenderun.

650
00:55:30,078 --> 00:55:31,997
The director
of the Museum of Antiquities

651
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,206
has sent a car for you.

652
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:35,583
Well, your servant, sir.

653
00:55:35,834 --> 00:55:36,918
And I am his.

654
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:38,962
Follow me, please.

655
00:55:39,421 --> 00:55:41,006
My reputation precedes me.

656
00:55:41,089 --> 00:55:43,258
There is no museum in Iskenderun.

657
00:55:43,341 --> 00:55:44,718
Papers, please.

658
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:47,178
Papers? Of course.

659
00:55:47,262 --> 00:55:48,722
- Run.
- Yes.

660
00:55:48,805 --> 00:55:50,557
Papers. Got it here.

661
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,267
Just finished reading it myself.

662
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,519
- Run.
- Yes.

663
00:55:54,602 --> 00:55:56,521
Egyptian Mail, morning edition. Run.

664
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:57,814
Did you say...

665
00:55:57,939 --> 00:55:59,357
Run!

666
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:16,041
Okay, okay, quick, quick, quick!

667
00:56:16,124 --> 00:56:19,127
Find the back door! Find the back door!

668
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:34,350
Intolerable.

669
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:38,563
Dr. Schneider. Message from Berlin.

670
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:40,440
You must return immediately.

671
00:56:40,523 --> 00:56:43,359
- A rally at the Institute of Aryan Culture.
- So?

672
00:56:43,443 --> 00:56:47,614
Your presence on the platform
is requested at the highest level.

673
00:56:47,697 --> 00:56:50,700
Thank you, Herr Oberst.
I will meet you at Iskenderun.

674
00:56:50,784 --> 00:56:52,702
Take this diary
to the Reichmuseum in Berlin.

675
00:56:52,786 --> 00:56:55,330
It will show them our progress,
ahead of schedule.

676
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:57,832
Without the map,
I'm afraid it's no better than a souvenir.

677
00:56:57,916 --> 00:56:59,167
Let me kill them now.

678
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,335
No.

679
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:02,253
If we fail to recover
the pages from Brody,

680
00:57:02,337 --> 00:57:03,922
we'll need them alive.

681
00:57:04,005 --> 00:57:06,508
Always do what the doctor orders.

682
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:15,850
Don't look at me like that.

683
00:57:16,726 --> 00:57:18,520
We both wanted the Grail.

684
00:57:18,603 --> 00:57:20,522
I would have done anything to get it.

685
00:57:20,605 --> 00:57:22,607
You would have done the same.

686
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:24,609
I'm sorry you think so.

687
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:39,415
I can't forget how wonderful it was.

688
00:57:39,499 --> 00:57:40,542
Thank you.

689
00:57:40,625 --> 00:57:42,544
It was rather wonderful.

690
00:57:51,553 --> 00:57:53,555
Dr. Schneider.

691
00:57:55,265 --> 00:57:56,683
Your car is waiting.

692
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:06,901
That's how Austrians say good-bye.

693
00:58:13,408 --> 00:58:17,328
And this is how we say good-bye
in Germany, Dr. Jones.

694
00:58:25,295 --> 00:58:27,505
I liked the Austrian way better.

695
00:58:27,589 --> 00:58:29,257
So did I.

696
00:58:29,591 --> 00:58:30,925
Let's try and get these ropes loose.

697
00:58:31,009 --> 00:58:33,845
We've got to get to Marcus
before the Nazis do.

698
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:37,640
You said he had two days' start.
That he would blend in. Disappear.

699
00:58:37,724 --> 00:58:39,184
Are you kidding? I made that up.

700
00:58:39,267 --> 00:58:42,478
You know Marcus.
He got lost once in his own museum.

701
00:58:44,856 --> 00:58:47,525
Can you try and reach
my left jacket pocket?

702
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:49,986
What am I looking for?

703
00:58:50,069 --> 00:58:51,529
My lucky charm.

704
00:58:53,114 --> 00:58:54,616
Feels like a cigarette lighter.

705
00:58:56,117 --> 00:58:57,327
Try and burn through the ropes.

706
00:58:59,245 --> 00:59:00,455
Very good.

707
00:59:25,188 --> 00:59:26,397
I ought to tell you something.

708
00:59:26,481 --> 00:59:29,567
Don't get sentimental now, Dad.
Save it till we get out of here.

709
00:59:29,651 --> 00:59:30,985
The floor's on fire.

710
00:59:31,194 --> 00:59:32,654
- See?
- What?

711
00:59:33,488 --> 00:59:34,614
And the chair.

712
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:37,075
Move! Move it out of here! Go!

713
00:59:37,158 --> 00:59:38,952
It's scorching the table! Fast!

714
00:59:39,035 --> 00:59:40,078
- Move!
- Okay!

715
00:59:54,342 --> 00:59:56,844
Well, we have Marcus Brody,

716
00:59:56,928 --> 00:59:59,180
but more important, we have the map.

717
01:00:03,518 --> 01:00:05,103
"By the personal command
of the Fuhrer.

718
01:00:05,186 --> 01:00:07,188
"Secrecy essential to success.

719
01:00:07,272 --> 01:00:09,691
"Eliminate the American conspirators. "

720
01:00:10,525 --> 01:00:13,861
Germany has declared war
on the Jones boys.

721
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:23,121
- Dad!
- What?

722
01:00:23,204 --> 01:00:24,831
Head for the fireplace!

723
01:00:37,969 --> 01:00:40,638
I think I can get these ropes off.

724
01:00:53,151 --> 01:00:55,236
Our situation has not improved.

725
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,572
Listen, Dad, I'm almost free.

726
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:15,381
Alarm!

727
01:01:23,514 --> 01:01:25,600
This is intolerable.

728
01:01:26,267 --> 01:01:27,352
I'm out, Dad.

729
01:01:27,435 --> 01:01:29,187
Well done, boy.

730
01:02:05,348 --> 01:02:07,100
Come on, Dad.

731
01:02:13,356 --> 01:02:15,149
Dead end.

732
01:02:15,233 --> 01:02:16,484
There's got to be a...

733
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:19,195
A secret door or a...

734
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:20,446
Passageway or something.

735
01:02:20,655 --> 01:02:23,825
I find that if I just sit down and think...

736
01:02:26,411 --> 01:02:28,996
Dad!

737
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,627
...The solution presents itself.

738
01:02:42,385 --> 01:02:45,012
Great. More boats.

739
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:51,644
You say this has been
just another typical day for you, huh?

740
01:02:53,271 --> 01:02:56,232
No! But better than most.

741
01:02:58,734 --> 01:03:00,778
Come on, Dad. Come on.

742
01:03:00,862 --> 01:03:02,572
What about the boat?

743
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,906
We're not going on the boat?

744
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:20,089
Jones!

745
01:04:32,787 --> 01:04:33,829
Halt! Halt!

746
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,852
- Stop!
- What?

747
01:05:37,935 --> 01:05:40,021
Stop! Stop!

748
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:44,358
You're going the wrong way.
We have to get to Berlin.

749
01:05:44,442 --> 01:05:45,901
Brody's this way.

750
01:05:45,985 --> 01:05:47,778
My diary's in Berlin.

751
01:05:47,862 --> 01:05:49,822
We don't need the diary, Dad.

752
01:05:49,905 --> 01:05:51,324
Marcus has the map.

753
01:05:51,407 --> 01:05:54,619
There is more in the diary
than just the map.

754
01:05:54,827 --> 01:05:57,622
All right, Dad. Tell me.

755
01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:03,919
Well, he who finds the Grail
must face the final challenge.

756
01:06:04,003 --> 01:06:05,796
What final challenge?

757
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,674
Three devices of such lethal cunning.

758
01:06:08,758 --> 01:06:10,384
- Booby traps?
- Yes.

759
01:06:11,844 --> 01:06:15,306
But I found the clues that
will safely take us through,

760
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:17,600
in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.

761
01:06:17,683 --> 01:06:19,310
Well, what are they?

762
01:06:22,855 --> 01:06:24,231
Can't you remember?

763
01:06:26,192 --> 01:06:30,112
I wrote them down in my diary
so that I wouldn't have to remember.

764
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:33,741
Half the German army's on our tail,
and you want me to go to Berlin?

765
01:06:33,824 --> 01:06:35,826
- Into the lion's den?
- Yes.

766
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:38,079
The only thing that matters is the Grail.

767
01:06:38,162 --> 01:06:39,622
What about Marcus?

768
01:06:39,705 --> 01:06:41,290
Marcus would agree with me.

769
01:06:42,291 --> 01:06:44,126
Two selfless martyrs.

770
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:45,544
Jesus Christ.

771
01:06:49,298 --> 01:06:51,884
That's for blasphemy.

772
01:06:54,637 --> 01:06:58,265
The quest for the Grail
is not archaeology.

773
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:01,936
It's a race against evil.

774
01:07:02,269 --> 01:07:04,814
If it is captured by the Nazis,

775
01:07:04,897 --> 01:07:08,526
the armies of darkness
will march all over the face of the Earth.

776
01:07:08,609 --> 01:07:09,694
Do you understand me?

777
01:07:11,445 --> 01:07:13,698
This is an obsession, Dad.

778
01:07:13,781 --> 01:07:17,034
I never understood it. Never.

779
01:07:19,286 --> 01:07:21,205
Neither did Mom.

780
01:07:21,288 --> 01:07:22,957
Yes, she did.

781
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:24,959
Only too well.

782
01:07:26,377 --> 01:07:29,797
Unfortunately, she kept
her illness from me

783
01:07:31,257 --> 01:07:32,800
until all I could do was mourn her.

784
01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:38,866
My boy, we are pilgrims
in an unholy land.

785
01:09:08,646 --> 01:09:10,564
FrÃ©ulein Doctor.

786
01:09:11,065 --> 01:09:12,983
- Where is it?
- How did you get here?

787
01:09:13,067 --> 01:09:15,110
Where is it? I want it.

788
01:09:18,364 --> 01:09:20,908
You came back for the book? Why?

789
01:09:21,659 --> 01:09:23,494
My father didn't want it incinerated.

790
01:09:23,577 --> 01:09:25,204
Is that what you think of me?

791
01:09:25,287 --> 01:09:27,665
I believe in the Grail, not the swastika.

792
01:09:27,748 --> 01:09:29,083
But you stood up to be counted

793
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:31,502
with the enemy of everything
that the Grail stands for.

794
01:09:31,585 --> 01:09:33,128
Who gives a damn what you think?

795
01:09:33,212 --> 01:09:35,256
You do.

796
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:38,425
All I have to do is squeeze.

797
01:09:38,676 --> 01:09:41,262
All I have to do is scream.

798
01:09:50,771 --> 01:09:53,858
I've got it. Let's get the hell out of here.

799
01:11:06,555 --> 01:11:07,681
- What did you get?
- I don't know.

800
01:11:07,765 --> 01:11:09,183
First available flight out of Germany.

801
01:11:09,308 --> 01:11:11,018
Good.

802
01:11:37,044 --> 01:11:39,380
Well, we made it.

803
01:11:40,506 --> 01:11:43,384
When we're airborne,
with Germany behind us,

804
01:11:43,467 --> 01:11:45,803
then I'll share that sentiment.

805
01:11:45,886 --> 01:11:47,513
Relax.

806
01:12:33,392 --> 01:12:35,352
Tickets, please.

807
01:12:46,488 --> 01:12:49,950
Guten Tag, Herr Jones.

808
01:12:54,121 --> 01:12:55,873
Tickets, please.

809
01:13:07,092 --> 01:13:09,011
We should get out of here.

810
01:13:11,096 --> 01:13:12,639
No ticket.

811
01:13:15,559 --> 01:13:16,560
Ticket.

812
01:13:16,643 --> 01:13:18,937
- Ticket!
- Ticket!

813
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:37,915
You know,

814
01:13:37,998 --> 01:13:42,086
sharing your adventures is
an interesting experience.

815
01:13:43,212 --> 01:13:45,005
That's not all we shared.

816
01:13:45,089 --> 01:13:47,424
It's disgraceful.
You're old enough to be her fa...

817
01:13:47,508 --> 01:13:48,926
Her grandfather.

818
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:51,011
Well, I'm as human as the next man.

819
01:13:51,095 --> 01:13:53,013
I was the next man.

820
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,559
Of course. Well...

821
01:13:57,643 --> 01:13:59,353
Ships that pass in the night.

822
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:03,524
Do you remember the last time
we had a quiet drink?

823
01:14:05,317 --> 01:14:07,319
I had a milkshake.

824
01:14:08,237 --> 01:14:10,155
What did we talk about?

825
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,033
We didn't talk.

826
01:14:14,076 --> 01:14:16,036
We never talked.

827
01:14:17,704 --> 01:14:20,124
Do I detect a rebuke?

828
01:14:21,667 --> 01:14:24,461
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad.

829
01:14:24,545 --> 01:14:27,089
It was a lonely way to grow up.
For you, too.

830
01:14:27,172 --> 01:14:28,799
If you'd been an ordinary,
average father,

831
01:14:28,882 --> 01:14:30,884
like the other guys' dads,
you'd have understood that.

832
01:14:31,844 --> 01:14:34,179
Actually, I was a wonderful father.

833
01:14:34,263 --> 01:14:35,806
When?

834
01:14:36,515 --> 01:14:38,934
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed?

835
01:14:39,017 --> 01:14:40,477
Wash your ears? Do your homework?

836
01:14:40,561 --> 01:14:45,524
No. I respected your privacy,
and I taught you self-reliance.

837
01:14:45,607 --> 01:14:48,193
What you taught me was
that I was less important to you

838
01:14:48,277 --> 01:14:51,655
than people who'd been dead
for 500 years in another country.

839
01:14:51,738 --> 01:14:53,699
And I learned it so well

840
01:14:53,782 --> 01:14:55,993
that we've hardly spoken for 20 years.

841
01:14:56,076 --> 01:14:58,912
You left just when
you were becoming interesting

842
01:14:58,996 --> 01:15:00,080
Unbelievable.

843
01:15:00,164 --> 01:15:01,957
- Dad, how can you...
- Very well.

844
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,001
I'm here now.

845
01:15:05,377 --> 01:15:07,004
What do you want to talk about?

846
01:15:08,589 --> 01:15:10,174
Well, I...

847
01:15:18,265 --> 01:15:20,017
I can't think of anything.

848
01:15:20,392 --> 01:15:22,352
Then what are you complaining about?

849
01:15:23,979 --> 01:15:25,898
Look, we have work to do.

850
01:15:27,524 --> 01:15:32,571
When we get to Alexandretta,
we will face three challenges.

851
01:15:33,071 --> 01:15:38,035
The first, "The Breath of God.
Only the penitent man will pass. "

852
01:15:38,118 --> 01:15:41,246
Second, "The Word of God.

853
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:44,374
"Only in the footsteps of God
will he proceed. "

854
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:46,793
Third, "The Path Of God.

855
01:15:47,252 --> 01:15:52,633
"Only in the leap from the lion's head
will he prove his worth. "

856
01:15:54,134 --> 01:15:56,220
What does that mean?

857
01:15:56,303 --> 01:15:59,223
I don't know. We'll find out.

858
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,024
We're turning around.

859
01:16:09,107 --> 01:16:11,026
They're taking us back to Germany.

860
01:16:18,075 --> 01:16:19,576
Well, I thought it would
take them a lot longer

861
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:20,911
to figure out the radio was dead.

862
01:16:20,994 --> 01:16:22,663
Come on, Dad. Move!

863
01:16:27,209 --> 01:16:29,461
Come on, Dad. Come on!

864
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:45,185
I didn't know you could fly a plane.

865
01:16:45,269 --> 01:16:46,353
Fly, yes.

866
01:16:48,563 --> 01:16:50,524
Land,no.

867
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,675
Dad, you're going to have to
use the machine gun.

868
01:17:16,758 --> 01:17:18,510
Get it ready.

869
01:17:19,886 --> 01:17:21,263
Eleven o'clock!

870
01:17:22,014 --> 01:17:23,598
Dad, eleven o'clock!

871
01:17:25,309 --> 01:17:27,561
What happens at eleven o'clock?

872
01:17:27,644 --> 01:17:29,313
Twelve, eleven, ten.

873
01:17:29,396 --> 01:17:32,065
Eleven o'clock, fire!

874
01:17:57,674 --> 01:18:00,385
Dad, are we hit?

875
01:18:00,469 --> 01:18:02,095
More or less.

876
01:18:02,637 --> 01:18:04,514
Son, I'm sorry.

877
01:18:04,598 --> 01:18:06,058
They got us.

878
01:18:08,101 --> 01:18:10,270
Hang on, Dad. We're going in!

879
01:18:23,325 --> 01:18:25,786
- Nice landing.
- Thanks.

880
01:18:41,093 --> 01:18:42,344
Those people are trying to kill us!

881
01:18:42,427 --> 01:18:44,179
I know, Dad!

882
01:18:44,262 --> 01:18:47,474
Well. It's a new experience for me.

883
01:18:47,808 --> 01:18:49,434
It happens to me all the time.

884
01:19:20,173 --> 01:19:21,883
This is intolerable!

885
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:24,636
This could be close.

886
01:19:33,854 --> 01:19:35,522
Faster, boy! Faster!

887
01:19:51,246 --> 01:19:53,540
Well, they don't come
any closer than that!

888
01:20:09,473 --> 01:20:12,642
Dad, he's coming back!

889
01:20:59,231 --> 01:21:01,858
I suddenly
remembered my Charlemagne.

890
01:21:01,942 --> 01:21:04,778
"Let my armies be
the rocks and the trees

891
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:07,113
"and the birds in the sky. "

892
01:21:24,923 --> 01:21:28,343
These pages are taken from
Professor Jones' diary, Your Highness,

893
01:21:28,426 --> 01:21:29,719
and they include a map

894
01:21:29,803 --> 01:21:32,806
that pinpoints
the exact location of the Grail.

895
01:21:32,889 --> 01:21:35,642
As you can see,
the Grail is all but in our hands.

896
01:21:35,725 --> 01:21:36,935
However, Your Highness,

897
01:21:37,018 --> 01:21:39,938
we would not think of crossing your soil
without your permission,

898
01:21:40,021 --> 01:21:42,023
nor of removing the Grail
from your borders

899
01:21:42,107 --> 01:21:45,151
without suitable compensation.

900
01:21:47,737 --> 01:21:49,948
What have you brought?

901
01:21:57,581 --> 01:22:00,125
Precious valuables, Your Highness,

902
01:22:00,208 --> 01:22:04,421
donated by some of the finest families
in all of Germany.

903
01:22:09,593 --> 01:22:12,387
Rolls-Royce Phantom Two.

904
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:16,600
Four-point-three liter, 30 horsepower,
six-cylinder engine,

905
01:22:16,683 --> 01:22:19,477
with Stromberg downdraft carburetor.

906
01:22:19,561 --> 01:22:22,856
Can go from zero to
100 kilometers an hour

907
01:22:22,939 --> 01:22:25,775
in 12.5 seconds.

908
01:22:25,859 --> 01:22:27,402
And I even like the color.

909
01:22:28,361 --> 01:22:30,905
The keys are in the ignition,
Your Highness.

910
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:35,118
You shall have camels, horses,

911
01:22:35,201 --> 01:22:37,621
an armed escort, provisions,

912
01:22:37,704 --> 01:22:40,373
desert vehicles and tanks.

913
01:22:40,457 --> 01:22:42,208
You're welcome.

914
01:22:57,974 --> 01:22:59,100
We have no time to lose.

915
01:22:59,184 --> 01:23:01,728
Indiana Jones
and his father have escaped.

916
01:23:04,731 --> 01:23:06,316
We go this way.

917
01:23:06,483 --> 01:23:07,984
Get that camel out of the way.

918
01:23:10,487 --> 01:23:12,697
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?

919
01:23:12,781 --> 01:23:15,283
They set out across the desert
this afternoon.

920
01:23:15,367 --> 01:23:18,620
I believe they took Mr. Brody with them.

921
01:23:19,871 --> 01:23:22,123
Now they have the map.

922
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:25,210
And in this sort of race,

923
01:23:25,293 --> 01:23:28,171
there's no silver medal
for finishing second.

924
01:23:50,610 --> 01:23:53,071
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?

925
01:23:53,154 --> 01:23:55,031
I'd rather spit in your face.

926
01:23:55,115 --> 01:23:57,617
But as I haven't got any spit...

927
01:23:59,994 --> 01:24:02,872
Must be within three or four miles.

928
01:24:02,956 --> 01:24:05,542
Otherwise we are off the map.

929
01:24:07,043 --> 01:24:10,672
Well, Marcus,
we are on the brink of the recovery of

930
01:24:10,755 --> 01:24:14,384
the greatest artifact
in the history of mankind.

931
01:24:14,467 --> 01:24:18,263
You're meddling with powers
you cannot possibly comprehend.

932
01:24:25,228 --> 01:24:27,272
I see Brody.

933
01:24:27,647 --> 01:24:29,065
He seems okay.

934
01:24:32,152 --> 01:24:34,779
They've got a tank.

935
01:24:40,243 --> 01:24:42,078
Six-pound gun.

936
01:24:42,162 --> 01:24:44,038
What do you think you're doing there?
Get down!

937
01:24:44,956 --> 01:24:47,000
Dad, we're well out of range.

938
01:24:57,302 --> 01:24:58,470
That car belonged to my brother-in-law.

939
01:24:58,553 --> 01:25:00,096
Come on, come on!

940
01:25:00,221 --> 01:25:02,432
I can't see anyone up there.

941
01:25:02,515 --> 01:25:03,767
Maybe it wasn't even Jones.

942
01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:06,102
No, it is him, all right.

943
01:25:06,186 --> 01:25:07,812
He's here somewhere.

944
01:25:08,855 --> 01:25:10,815
Put Brody in the tank.

945
01:25:17,739 --> 01:25:20,533
Well, in this sun,

946
01:25:20,617 --> 01:25:22,952
without transportation,
they're as good as dead.

947
01:25:32,545 --> 01:25:33,880
It's Jones, all right.

948
01:25:38,384 --> 01:25:40,470
- Now, who are all these people?
- Who cares?

949
01:25:40,553 --> 01:25:42,388
As long as
they're keeping Donovan busy.

950
01:25:43,223 --> 01:25:46,810
Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I
organize some transportation.

951
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:13,920
- I'm going after those horses.
- I'll take the camels.

952
01:26:14,003 --> 01:26:15,588
- I don't need camels.
- But, Indy...

953
01:26:15,672 --> 01:26:17,090
No camels.

954
01:26:28,351 --> 01:26:29,477
Who is he?

955
01:26:31,062 --> 01:26:33,189
A messenger from God.

956
01:26:34,649 --> 01:26:36,985
For the unrighteous,

957
01:26:37,068 --> 01:26:40,655
the Cup of Life
holds everlasting damnation.

958
01:26:59,799 --> 01:27:01,885
Marcus!

959
01:27:03,469 --> 01:27:05,638
"Genius of the Restoration... "

960
01:27:06,097 --> 01:27:08,474
"Aid our own resuscitation. "

961
01:27:08,558 --> 01:27:09,767
Henry, what are you doing here?

962
01:27:09,851 --> 01:27:11,227
It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.

963
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:19,235
Search him.

964
01:27:20,153 --> 01:27:21,988
What is in this book?

965
01:27:22,071 --> 01:27:25,491
That miserable little diary of yours.

966
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:27,994
We have the map. The book is useless.

967
01:27:28,077 --> 01:27:30,955
And yet you come all the way back
to Berlin to get it.

968
01:27:31,039 --> 01:27:32,665
VVhy?

969
01:27:32,749 --> 01:27:34,792
What are you hiding?

970
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:38,379
What does the diary tell you
that it doesn't tell us?

971
01:27:39,589 --> 01:27:43,593
It tells me that goose-stepping morons
like yourself

972
01:27:43,676 --> 01:27:46,763
should try reading books
instead of burning them.

973
01:27:47,221 --> 01:27:48,348
Colonel!

974
01:27:48,431 --> 01:27:50,433
Jones is getting away.

975
01:27:50,516 --> 01:27:51,601
I think not,

976
01:27:51,893 --> 01:27:53,019
Herr Donovan.

977
01:27:53,227 --> 01:27:56,064
Not that Jones, the other Jones!

978
01:28:05,031 --> 01:28:07,450
Sallah, I said no camels!

979
01:28:07,533 --> 01:28:09,786
That's five camels. Can't you count?

980
01:28:09,869 --> 01:28:12,205
Compensation for
my brother-in-law's car.

981
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:14,332
Indy, your father and Brody...

982
01:28:14,624 --> 01:28:15,792
Where's my father?

983
01:28:15,875 --> 01:28:17,043
They have them.

984
01:28:17,335 --> 01:28:19,379
In the belly of that steel beast.

985
01:28:42,568 --> 01:28:43,611
Fire!

986
01:30:44,565 --> 01:30:46,859
Dad! Dad!

987
01:30:46,943 --> 01:30:49,195
- Dad!
- Junior?

988
01:30:49,278 --> 01:30:50,613
Junior?

989
01:30:50,863 --> 01:30:52,031
Junior!

990
01:32:07,607 --> 01:32:09,233
Dad!

991
01:32:09,984 --> 01:32:11,068
Dad!

992
01:32:11,194 --> 01:32:12,945
Dad! Get out!

993
01:33:33,401 --> 01:33:34,694
Henry, the pen...

994
01:33:34,944 --> 01:33:36,362
- What?
- But don't you see?

995
01:33:36,445 --> 01:33:39,699
The pen is mightier than the sword.

996
01:34:02,221 --> 01:34:03,639
Look what you did.

997
01:34:03,723 --> 01:34:05,224
It's war.

998
01:34:11,022 --> 01:34:13,566
Didn't I tell you it was a rescue?

999
01:35:17,588 --> 01:35:19,673
- Dad!
- Yeah?

1000
01:35:20,633 --> 01:35:22,134
You call this archaeology?

1001
01:35:22,218 --> 01:35:23,386
Get out of there, Dad.

1002
01:35:34,688 --> 01:35:36,399
How does one get off this thing?

1003
01:35:43,322 --> 01:35:44,448
Where's Marcus?

1004
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:50,704
Dad!

1005
01:35:54,125 --> 01:35:55,292
Hang on, Dad!

1006
01:36:02,174 --> 01:36:04,218
Father of Indy, give me your hand!

1007
01:36:05,010 --> 01:36:06,095
Sallah!

1008
01:36:06,178 --> 01:36:07,471
Get Dad!

1009
01:36:07,555 --> 01:36:09,348
Give me your hand!

1010
01:36:58,105 --> 01:36:59,899
Junior!

1011
01:37:01,775 --> 01:37:03,861
Indy!

1012
01:37:12,411 --> 01:37:14,538
Oh, God.

1013
01:37:14,622 --> 01:37:16,749
I've lost him.

1014
01:37:20,336 --> 01:37:22,963
And I never told him anything.

1015
01:37:25,466 --> 01:37:28,010
I just wasn't ready, Marcus.

1016
01:37:29,011 --> 01:37:31,680
Five minutes would have been enough.

1017
01:38:08,634 --> 01:38:11,303
I thought I'd lost you, boy!

1018
01:38:12,805 --> 01:38:14,974
I thought you had too, sir.

1019
01:38:27,987 --> 01:38:29,530
Well...

1020
01:38:31,782 --> 01:38:34,827
Well done. Come on.

1021
01:38:37,871 --> 01:38:39,665
Let's go, then.

1022
01:38:42,167 --> 01:38:45,129
Why are you sitting there resting
when we're so near the end?

1023
01:38:45,212 --> 01:38:47,172
Come on, let's go!

1024
01:38:59,685 --> 01:39:03,439
The Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

1025
01:41:31,003 --> 01:41:32,296
Helmut, another volunteer!

1026
01:42:01,492 --> 01:42:04,161
I never expected to see you again.

1027
01:42:04,244 --> 01:42:06,663
I'm like a bad penny, I always turn up.

1028
01:42:06,747 --> 01:42:10,417
Step back now, Dr. Schneider.
Give Dr. Jones some room.

1029
01:42:11,168 --> 01:42:13,462
He's going to recover the Grail for us.

1030
01:42:16,548 --> 01:42:20,761
Impossible? What do you say, Jones?
Ready to go down in history?

1031
01:42:20,844 --> 01:42:23,931
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?

1032
01:42:24,014 --> 01:42:25,557
The Nazis?

1033
01:42:25,641 --> 01:42:28,060
Is that the limit of your vision?

1034
01:42:28,435 --> 01:42:32,105
The Nazis want to write themselves
into the Grail legend,

1035
01:42:32,189 --> 01:42:33,607
take on the world.

1036
01:42:34,316 --> 01:42:36,235
Well, they're welcome.

1037
01:42:37,402 --> 01:42:39,488
But I want the Grail itself.

1038
01:42:39,571 --> 01:42:42,699
The cup that gives everlasting life.

1039
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:46,286
Hitler can have the world,
but he can't take it with him.

1040
01:42:47,329 --> 01:42:51,250
I'm going to be drinking my own health
when he's gone the way of the dodo.

1041
01:42:55,212 --> 01:42:57,464
The Grail is mine,

1042
01:42:57,548 --> 01:42:59,508
and you're going to get it for me.

1043
01:42:59,591 --> 01:43:01,593
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.

1044
01:43:02,052 --> 01:43:03,804
You know something, Dr. Jones?

1045
01:43:03,887 --> 01:43:05,806
You're absolutely right.

1046
01:43:08,475 --> 01:43:09,518
Dad?

1047
01:43:10,769 --> 01:43:11,937
Dad?

1048
01:43:12,604 --> 01:43:13,689
Junior...

1049
01:43:13,772 --> 01:43:15,566
- No!
- Get back!

1050
01:43:33,584 --> 01:43:35,627
You can't save him when you're dead!

1051
01:43:36,003 --> 01:43:37,254
The healing power of the Grail

1052
01:43:37,337 --> 01:43:39,381
is the only thing
that can save your father now.

1053
01:43:39,464 --> 01:43:42,926
It's time to ask yourself
what you believe.

1054
01:44:18,462 --> 01:44:20,464
"The Breath of God.

1055
01:44:21,673 --> 01:44:24,343
"Only the penitent man will pass. "

1056
01:44:25,636 --> 01:44:28,180
"The penitent man will pass. "

1057
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:49,534
The penitent man will pass.

1058
01:44:49,618 --> 01:44:51,662
The penitent man...

1059
01:44:54,081 --> 01:44:59,252
"Only the penitent man will pass. "

1060
01:44:59,461 --> 01:45:03,423
The penitent man will pass.
The penitent, penitent...

1061
01:45:03,507 --> 01:45:04,800
The penitent man...

1062
01:45:04,967 --> 01:45:07,511
The penitent man... The penitent...

1063
01:45:07,886 --> 01:45:10,639
The penitent man is humble before God.

1064
01:45:10,722 --> 01:45:12,474
Penitent. Penitent...

1065
01:45:12,557 --> 01:45:14,309
The penitent man...

1066
01:45:14,559 --> 01:45:17,187
Penitent man is humble,

1067
01:45:17,646 --> 01:45:19,356
kneels before God.

1068
01:45:19,439 --> 01:45:21,316
Kneel!

1069
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:30,492
I'm through!

1070
01:45:32,744 --> 01:45:34,121
We're through.

1071
01:45:36,248 --> 01:45:37,833
He's all right.

1072
01:45:37,916 --> 01:45:39,251
No.

1073
01:45:39,876 --> 01:45:42,629
The second challenge:
"The Word of God. "

1074
01:45:42,713 --> 01:45:46,466
"Only in the footsteps of God
will he proceed. "

1075
01:45:50,137 --> 01:45:52,514
The Word of God...

1076
01:45:52,597 --> 01:45:53,890
The Word of...

1077
01:45:56,977 --> 01:46:00,564
Proceed in the footsteps of the Word.

1078
01:46:00,772 --> 01:46:03,942
- "The Word of God... "
- No, Henry. Try not to talk.

1079
01:46:11,158 --> 01:46:12,909
The name of God...

1080
01:46:14,619 --> 01:46:17,122
The name of God...

1081
01:46:18,790 --> 01:46:21,001
Jehovah.

1082
01:46:21,543 --> 01:46:26,840
But in the Latin alphabet,
Jehovah begins with an

1083
01:46:27,549 --> 01:46:28,717
J...

1084
01:46:34,890 --> 01:46:36,099
Oh, dear.

1085
01:46:40,312 --> 01:46:42,230
Idiot!

1086
01:46:42,314 --> 01:46:44,691
In Latin, Jehovah starts with an

1087
01:46:47,486 --> 01:46:48,987
"I."

1088
01:46:49,696 --> 01:46:50,739
"E."

1089
01:46:52,407 --> 01:46:53,450
"H."

1090
01:46:54,034 --> 01:46:55,535
"O."

1091
01:46:56,703 --> 01:46:58,205
"V."

1092
01:46:58,288 --> 01:46:59,748
"A."

1093
01:47:22,229 --> 01:47:23,855
"The Path of God. "

1094
01:47:27,651 --> 01:47:29,611
"Only in the leap from the lion's head

1095
01:47:30,529 --> 01:47:32,864
"will he prove his worth. "

1096
01:47:36,618 --> 01:47:39,704
Impossible, nobody can jump this.

1097
01:47:42,582 --> 01:47:43,583
Indy!

1098
01:47:44,209 --> 01:47:45,669
Indy, you must hurry!

1099
01:47:45,877 --> 01:47:47,546
Come quickly!

1100
01:47:53,468 --> 01:47:56,012
It's a leap of faith.

1101
01:47:56,096 --> 01:47:57,389
Oh, geez...

1102
01:47:57,722 --> 01:47:59,975
You must believe, boy.

1103
01:48:00,058 --> 01:48:02,477
You must believe.

1104
01:49:49,251 --> 01:49:51,753
I knew you'd come,

1105
01:49:51,836 --> 01:49:54,089
but my strength has left me.

1106
01:49:54,839 --> 01:49:56,007
Who are you?

1107
01:49:56,508 --> 01:49:58,635
The last of three brothers

1108
01:49:58,718 --> 01:50:01,805
who swore an oath to find the Grail

1109
01:50:01,888 --> 01:50:03,765
and to guard it.

1110
01:50:04,724 --> 01:50:06,351
That was 700 years ago.

1111
01:50:06,685 --> 01:50:09,020
A long time to wait.

1112
01:50:11,147 --> 01:50:14,651
You're strangely dressed, for a knight.

1113
01:50:15,485 --> 01:50:17,279
I'm not exactly...

1114
01:50:18,154 --> 01:50:19,781
A knight? What do you mean?

1115
01:50:20,365 --> 01:50:22,075
I was chosen

1116
01:50:22,158 --> 01:50:25,704
because I was the bravest,
the most worthy.

1117
01:50:25,787 --> 01:50:29,124
The honour was mine until another came

1118
01:50:29,207 --> 01:50:32,377
to challenge me to single combat.

1119
01:50:33,545 --> 01:50:39,509
I pass it to you who vanquished me.

1120
01:50:42,971 --> 01:50:45,390
Listen, I don't have time to explain, but...

1121
01:51:02,407 --> 01:51:03,825
Which one is it?

1122
01:51:04,242 --> 01:51:06,494
You must choose,

1123
01:51:06,578 --> 01:51:08,705
but choose wisely.

1124
01:51:08,788 --> 01:51:12,167
For as the true Grail will bring you life,

1125
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:13,293
the false Grail

1126
01:51:13,710 --> 01:51:15,587
will take it from you.

1127
01:51:21,593 --> 01:51:23,345
I'm not a historian.

1128
01:51:23,428 --> 01:51:25,472
I have no idea what it looks like.

1129
01:51:25,555 --> 01:51:27,932
Which one is it?

1130
01:51:28,016 --> 01:51:29,642
Let me choose.

1131
01:51:30,602 --> 01:51:32,562
Thank you, Doctor.

1132
01:51:45,492 --> 01:51:47,452
Yes.

1133
01:51:52,999 --> 01:51:56,461
It's more beautiful
than I'd ever imagined.

1134
01:52:07,806 --> 01:52:11,142
This certainly is the cup of
the King of Kings.

1135
01:52:17,607 --> 01:52:19,609
Eternal life.

1136
01:52:54,561 --> 01:52:56,980
What is happening to me?

1137
01:53:01,526 --> 01:53:03,403
Tell me, what is happening?

1138
01:53:26,718 --> 01:53:28,887
He chose

1139
01:53:28,970 --> 01:53:30,722
poorly.

1140
01:53:40,482 --> 01:53:43,026
It would not be made out of gold.

1141
01:53:43,109 --> 01:53:45,278
That's the cup of a carpenter.

1142
01:53:55,413 --> 01:53:57,332
There's only one way to find out.

1143
01:54:11,930 --> 01:54:15,683
You have chosen wisely.

1144
01:54:16,768 --> 01:54:21,064
But the Grail cannot pass
beyond the Great Seal.

1145
01:54:21,147 --> 01:54:26,277
That is the boundary
and the price of immortality.

1146
01:55:52,780 --> 01:55:55,575
Drop your guns. Please.

1147
01:55:58,911 --> 01:56:00,705
Dad, come on, get to your feet.

1148
01:56:15,303 --> 01:56:17,263
We have got it. Come on!

1149
01:56:18,723 --> 01:56:21,142
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!

1150
01:56:21,643 --> 01:56:23,269
It's ours, Indy, yours and mine.

1151
01:56:23,811 --> 01:56:25,855
Elsa, don't cross the Seal.

1152
01:56:25,938 --> 01:56:28,900
The knight warned us
not to take the Grail from here.

1153
01:56:55,510 --> 01:56:58,429
Junior!

1154
01:57:00,848 --> 01:57:02,058
Elsa...

1155
01:57:03,267 --> 01:57:05,144
Elsa, don't. Elsa...

1156
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:06,938
Elsa...

1157
01:57:07,021 --> 01:57:09,357
Give me your other hand, honey.
I can't hold you!

1158
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:11,693
I can reach it. I can reach it.

1159
01:57:11,776 --> 01:57:14,404
Elsa, give me your hand.
Give me your other hand!

1160
01:57:17,115 --> 01:57:18,408
Elsa!

1161
01:57:28,668 --> 01:57:30,294
Junior, give me your other hand!

1162
01:57:30,378 --> 01:57:32,296
I can't hold on.

1163
01:57:32,380 --> 01:57:33,589
I can get it.

1164
01:57:33,673 --> 01:57:35,967
I can almost reach it, Dad.

1165
01:57:36,509 --> 01:57:38,219
Indiana...

1166
01:57:39,429 --> 01:57:40,638
Indiana...

1167
01:57:44,016 --> 01:57:46,227
Let it go.

1168
01:58:05,496 --> 01:58:07,081
Dad...

1169
01:58:13,671 --> 01:58:15,506
Please, Dad.

1170
01:58:46,996 --> 01:58:49,832
Elsa never really believed in the Grail.

1171
01:58:49,916 --> 01:58:52,794
She thought she'd found a prize.

1172
01:58:59,050 --> 01:59:01,177
What did you find, Dad?

1173
01:59:01,385 --> 01:59:02,887
Me?

1174
01:59:05,515 --> 01:59:07,683
Illumination.

1175
01:59:16,859 --> 01:59:18,069
And what did you find, Junior?

1176
01:59:18,611 --> 01:59:20,613
"Junior"? Dad...

1177
01:59:20,696 --> 01:59:23,199
Please, what does it always mean,
this... This "Junior"?

1178
01:59:23,282 --> 01:59:26,160
That's his name: Henry Jones, Junior.

1179
01:59:26,244 --> 01:59:28,079
I like Indiana.

1180
01:59:28,162 --> 01:59:30,164
We named the dog Indiana.

1181
01:59:30,248 --> 01:59:32,416
May we go home now, please?

1182
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:33,668
The dog?

1183
01:59:34,544 --> 01:59:36,838
You are named after the dog?

1184
01:59:39,298 --> 01:59:42,927
I've got a lot of fond memories
of that dog.

1185
01:59:44,303 --> 01:59:46,848
- Ready?
- Ready.

1186
01:59:46,931 --> 01:59:50,142
Indy! Henry! Follow me. I know the way!

1187
01:59:55,940 --> 01:59:57,817
Got lost in his own museum, huh?

1188
01:59:59,735 --> 02:00:02,196
After you, Junior.

1189
02:00:02,280 --> 02:00:04,031
Yes, sir.
