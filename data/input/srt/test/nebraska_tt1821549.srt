1
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,731
Hey, partner.

2
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,068
Hold on there, just a second.

3
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,864
Where are you headed, there?

4
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,825
Where are you headed up to?

5
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,660
How are you doing there, bud?

6
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,662
Are you okay? Where are you headed?

7
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:22,498
You headed down the road, there, huh?

8
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,250
Where are you coming from?

9
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,669
Yeah?

10
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,362
There he is.

11
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,115
Thank you.

12
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,708
Well, there's the man of the hour.

13
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,502
The what?

14
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:33,546
The man of the hour.

15
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,756
l don't know.

16
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:41,012
So, you told the sheriff
that you were walking to Nebraska?

17
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,847
That's right.

18
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,099
To get my million dollars.

19
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,768
What million dollars?

20
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,072
"We are now authorized to
pay one million dollars

21
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:03,534
"to Woodrow T. Grant
of Billings, Montana."

22
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:04,827
Let me see that.

23
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,331
And your mother won't take me.

24
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,916
"Mega Sweepstakes Marketing."

25
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,335
Dad, this is a total come-on.

26
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,087
lt's one of the oldest gimmicks
in the book.

27
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,006
l didn't even know
they still did it anymore.

28
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,050
Well, they can't say it if it's not true.

29
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,427
They're just trying
to sell you magazines.

30
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,763
lt says l won.

31
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,599
So, mail it in. l'll help you.

32
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:30,186
l'm not trusting the mail
with a million dollars.

33
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,712
You dumb cluck.

34
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,423
You pretty near gave me a heart attack!

35
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,550
Just cool yourjets.

36
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,887
This is the second time
he's tried to sneak out.

37
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:08,933
l never knew the son of a bitch
even wanted to be a millionaire.

38
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,561
He should have thought about that
years ago and worked for it.

39
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,614
What would you do with
a million dollars anyway, Dad?

40
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,449
Buy a new truck.

41
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:26,867
You can't drive.

42
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,953
l'll get my license back.

43
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,455
Tell me when you do,
so l can stay off the road.

44
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,166
l need an air compressor, too.

45
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,502
Are you still harping on that?

46
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,295
Ed Pegram still has mine.

47
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,172
That's because he's a thief.

48
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,009
He's not a thief. l lent it to him.

49
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,844
Who's Ed Pegram?

50
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,013
A guy l knew back in Hawthorne.

51
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,723
And when did he borrow it?

52
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,266
'74.

53
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,851
That's almost 40 years.

54
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,436
He lives two states away.

55
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,271
l'd say he stole it.

56
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,149
That's why l need a new one.

57
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,192
Where are you off to now?

58
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,944
Sitting down.

59
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,947
He even sleeps with that stupid letter.

60
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,408
He's memorized it word for word.

61
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,619
l didn't think he could
memorize anything anymore.

62
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,709
Hey, what's with this casserole?

63
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:20,087
lt's lasagna. lt's still good, take it.

64
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,384
You know what l'd do
with a million dollars?

65
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,845
l'd put him in a home.

66
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,419
But that's not to say
that l can't set you up

67
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,129
with a whole lot more
reasonable speakers

68
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:03,464
that'll still blow your mind

69
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,591
if you're worried that
the Wilsons or Paradigms

70
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,301
are going to set you back too much.

71
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,178
You know, the way they
design speakers anymore,

72
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,180
you can't make a mistake.

73
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:12,973
Okay.

74
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,975
All right, well, yeah, let's...

75
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,561
We need to discuss it
and we'll get back to you.

76
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:18,896
l'll let you know.

77
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,107
Let me give you a card.

78
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,567
Give me a call any time if you
have any more questions.

79
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:24,819
-All right, thank you.
-Excellent.

80
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,362
Mark, Janice, a pleasure.

81
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,446
"Janice."

82
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,365
"Janice." Sorry.

83
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,119
David. Call, line one.

84
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,579
David Grant. Call, line one.

85
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:48,801
Where did they find him this time?

86
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,763
Way the hell
out on King Avenue by the Albertsons.

87
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:54,765
l can't take it anymore.

88
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,185
Ross is in there,
trying to talk some sense into him.

89
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,107
Ross.

90
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,400
Hi, David.

91
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,444
What's going on, Dad?

92
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,238
Ask Ma and Ross.

93
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,657
They seem to know it all.

94
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,242
l'm asking you.

95
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,828
Can't get her to turn over.

96
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,831
That's because it's been sitting there
for 1 0 years.

97
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,249
l'll get it running.

98
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,460
He still thinks
he's going to Lincoln to get his money.

99
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,424
Hey, Dad, how come you didn't
fix the truck first or take a bus?

100
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,467
Why did you just start walking?

101
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,596
Don't pull his chain like that.

102
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,599
The poor guy doesn't
know what's going on half the time.

103
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,976
l cut the solenoid wire
and stuck it back in

104
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,728
so that'll slow him down.

105
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,606
And Mom's right.
lt's time to think about a home.

106
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,066
She can't handle him anymore.
lt's not fair to her.

107
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,152
No. He doesn't need a nursing home.

108
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,238
The guy just needs
something to live for.

109
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,615
That's all this is about.

110
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,617
Yeah, and it's pathetic.

111
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:58,787
Seems like drinking always gave him
more than enough to live for until now.

112
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,458
Mom and l are looking at reality,
and you'd better start, too.

113
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,585
A home is in his best interests.

114
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,670
Which, let's face it,
is a hell of a lot more

115
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:07,922
than he ever thought about with us.

116
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,216
He never gave a shit about you or me.

117
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,014
l saw you anchoring the other night.

118
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,099
-Nice job.
-Thanks.

119
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,726
lt's your first time in the chair, right?

120
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,438
Yeah, Kelly Ann Castillo called in sick,
so they let me fill in.

121
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:28,317
And apparently l didn't
stink the place up too bad, so...

122
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,152
Tom Brokaw.

123
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,154
The new Tom Brokaw of Billings.

124
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:35,324
l don't know
about "Tom Brokaw" exactly,

125
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,534
but, yeah, it's looking pretty good.

126
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,661
l've paid my dues.

127
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,122
Plus, Kelly Ann's got
a pretty bad infection, so...

128
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,173
But opponents,
led by Councilman Barry Tilden,

129
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:55,052
claim the plan is
a "Pie in the Big Sky idea"

130
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,180
that will cost taxpayers
more than it's worth.

131
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:03,143
The Council is expected to debate
the proposal in Monday's session.

132
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,895
Coming up next, in sports,

133
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,274
Carter brings us the story
of a Hardin snowmobiler

134
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,485
who may have lost his legs,
but not his will to compete.

135
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,822
That, and more, after the break.
Stay with us.

136
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,707
Hi.

137
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,377
Are you moving back in?

138
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,297
No, these are yours.
l'm just returning them.

139
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,132
Right. Thanks.

140
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,222
You want to come in?

141
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,485
David, you need to water these plants.

142
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,195
These are plants.

143
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,339
l'd like you to change your mind.

144
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,341
What does that mean?

145
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,930
You know what it means.
l want you to move back in.

146
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,350
But l just moved out.

147
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,061
So, two years and we're back to dating?

148
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,230
l don't know yet.
We'll find out in a while.

149
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,070
Are we still having sex?

150
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,781
l've got to go.

151
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,866
Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Come on.

152
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,868
Are you saying
that we can't be together again

153
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,286
unless we get married?

154
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,873
Get married, break up, l don't know.

155
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,794
Let's do both. Let's do something.

156
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,381
Pick up or call me back,

157
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:56,965
-right now.
-Shit.

158
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,967
l don't know what
I'm going to do with him.

159
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,469
I'm going to put him in a...

160
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,221
Hi, Mom. l'm here.

161
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,034
Dad.

162
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:25,953
Dad!

163
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,663
Leave me alone.

164
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,555
Come on, let me take you home.

165
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,849
l'm going to Lincoln
if it's the last thing l do.

166
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,725
l don't care what you people think.

167
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,229
Listen to me. You didn't win anything.
lt's a complete scam.

168
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,480
So you've got to stop this, okay?

169
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,274
l'm running out of time.

170
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,859
You don't even have a suitcase.

171
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,318
l'm not staying there.

172
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,736
Dad.

173
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,071
l can't let you go.

174
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,448
lt's none of your business.

175
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,408
Yes, it is. l'm your son.

176
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,368
Well, then why don't you take me?

177
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,288
l can't just drop everything
and drive to Lincoln, Nebraska.

178
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,458
What else you got going on?

179
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,758
Have you lost your marbles, too?

180
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:26,221
Get your father out of your car
this goddamned instant.

181
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,057
You need to help me.

182
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,768
l'm the one who does
all the work around here.

183
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,687
Your fatherjust sits there.

184
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,647
Look at him. He's useless.

185
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:36,940
His mother spoiled him.

186
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,692
Mom, don't worry, okay?

187
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,527
We'll only be gone a couple of days.

188
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,488
Why don't you just enjoy the time alone?

189
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,573
You always complain
about having him around.

190
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,116
What about yourjob?

191
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,826
Well, l told them l was sick.

192
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,328
Sick in the head.

193
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:52,456
l'm going to tell Ross to call you.
He'll back me up.

194
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,541
Right. Sounds great. Bye, Mom.

195
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,421
You're just like your father.

196
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,465
Stubborn as a mule!

197
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:26,823
Let me know when you get tired.
l'll drive.

198
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,951
You can't drive.

199
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,746
l can drive a hell
of a lot better than that moron.

200
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,540
All right, Dad.

201
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,918
l can drive a hell of a lot
better than that moron.

202
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:46,820
Shit.

203
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,308
Jesus Christ, Dad,
what are you doing here?

204
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,353
l got thirsty.

205
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,897
Well, good to see you're not drinking.

206
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,857
Beer ain't "drinking."

207
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,028
Let's go.

208
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,707
-Hey, Dad.
-Yeah?

209
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,750
How about we go see Mount Rushmore?

210
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:25,961
We don't have time for that.

211
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,879
lt's just 30 minutes off the lnterstate.

212
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,339
We're right here.

213
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,633
lt's just a bunch of rocks.

214
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,646
So, what do you think, Dad?

215
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,898
lt doesn't look finished to me.

216
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,483
How do you mean?

217
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:51,486
Well, looks like somebody
got bored doing it.

218
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:55,407
Washington's the only one
with any clothes,

219
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,160
and they're just kind of roughed in.

220
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,371
Lincoln doesn't even have an ear.

221
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,916
Okay, we've seen it.

222
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:54,174
Dad?

223
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,760
Come here. Oh, Jesus.

224
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,396
Oh, Dad.

225
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,816
l'm fine.

226
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,693
Go back to bed.

227
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,824
All right, sir.

228
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,659
Are you hanging with me?

229
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,042
Let me know if l'm hurting you, bud.

230
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,842
Don't worry about it. Almost done.

231
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,521
All right, sir.
That ought to pretty much do it.

232
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,106
You did great.

233
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,821
Give me a second.

234
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,412
Where's my teeth?

235
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,248
You lost your teeth?

236
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,546
Did you leave them at the motel?

237
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,839
No.

238
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,299
The tavern?

239
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,634
l wasn't in no tavern.

240
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,053
Did you leave them
at the place where they serve alcohol

241
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,680
that you don't call a tavern?

242
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,893
Must have been when
l fell by the tracks.

243
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,773
Gentlemen, thank you for your patience.

244
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,567
Considering
it's a pretty bad head wound,

245
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,485
his age, his confusion,

246
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,945
and his history of drinking,

247
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,697
l really think we should
keep him in the hospital

248
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,157
a day or so for observation.

249
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,658
l don't drink.

250
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,410
You hear that, Dad?

251
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,579
We won't be making Lincoln by Friday.

252
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,497
We have until Monday.

253
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,458
We're going to take you back home.

254
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,709
l'm not going home.

255
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,753
No, l can't wait until Monday.

256
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,756
That means l wouldn't be
back at work until Wednesday.

257
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,799
Selling record players.

258
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,719
l won a million dollars.

259
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,596
Congratulations.

260
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,557
That will just
about pay for a day in the hospital.

261
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:19,527
Dad.

262
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,115
Hey, l looked,
but l couldn't find your teeth anywhere.

263
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,534
They're by the tracks.

264
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,287
Listen, Mom talked
to Uncle Ray and Aunt Martha,

265
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:31,706
and they're going to put us up in
Hawthorne over the weekend.

266
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,043
l don't want to go to Hawthorne.

267
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,587
There's no sense going to
Lincoln over the weekend.

268
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:39,631
l will get you there Monday morning.

269
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,175
Anyway, Aunt Martha
said she'd invite all your brothers over

270
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,302
and have a little get-together on Sunday.

271
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:47,305
Mom's coming down on the bus, maybe
Ross and Marcie, too.

272
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,598
lt'll be nice.

273
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,893
l don't want to go to Hawthorne.

274
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,416
Okay! Dad, l found it!

275
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:16,751
Here it is!

276
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,841
Wait. This isn't yours.

277
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,722
l was kidding. Here.

278
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,020
These ain't mine.

279
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,354
Of course they're yours.

280
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:37,522
No.

281
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,357
Whose else is it going to be?

282
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,359
-See if it fits.
-They're not my teeth.

283
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:42,527
They have to be.

284
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,654
l ought to know my own teeth.

285
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,081
Of course they're my teeth.

286
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,542
Don't be a moron.

287
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,207
Well, hello there, boys!

288
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,042
-Hey, Aunt Martha.
-Hi.

289
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,295
Woody!

290
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,172
Martha.

291
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,385
Davey!

292
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:15,930
Look at you, Davey.

293
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:19,142
You couldn't have been more than 1 5
the last time you were here.

294
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:22,353
That was what l was saying to Dad.
lt's been a long time.

295
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,689
Well, what do you got to
say for yourself, Woody?

296
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:25,815
Nothing.

297
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,400
What did you do to your head?

298
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,610
Fell.

299
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:32,030
You Grant brothers
sure are men of few words.

300
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,448
Come on in.

301
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,832
Look who l found hanging
around out front, Ray.

302
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:45,126
Your little brother, Woody.

303
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,131
What's up, Woody?

304
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,258
Nothing.

305
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:54,052
How about you?

306
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,513
Not much.

307
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,015
Hi, Uncle Ray.

308
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,101
You have a latrine?

309
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,687
Around the corner, to your left.

310
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:10,360
You boys remember your cousin David?

311
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,237
-Bart.
-Hey.

312
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,030
-Cole.
-Hey.

313
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,574
lt's been a long time
since we all met as kids.

314
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:17,825
What are you guys up to?

315
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,994
Not much.

316
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:24,249
This economy has just
tore up Hawthorne, Davey.

317
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,000
Things are hard for young men.

318
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:29,879
Yeah, l'm in the home theater
and electronics business myself.

319
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:32,173
lt's a rough time, l'll tell you that.

320
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,554
Cole, here, did some jail.

321
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:40,723
Don't bring that up.

322
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,351
Bitch lied through her teeth.

323
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,770
l will not have
that language in my house.

324
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:46,854
Sorry, Mom.

325
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,524
Now, Davey, you sit down.
You must be starving.

326
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,276
l made sandwiches.

327
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,246
So, how long did it take you to get here?

328
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,455
l don't know.

329
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,749
We got sort of waylaid in Rapid City.

330
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,418
That's where Dad had his little accident.

331
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:10,545
But how long, total?

332
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:13,464
A couple of days, l guess.

333
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,383
-From Billings?
-Yeah.

334
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,968
How far is that?

335
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:20,638
lt's probably about 750 miles.

336
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:24,517
lt took you two days to drive 750 miles?

337
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,520
What were you driving,
a dump truck or something?

338
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:31,691
lt's a Subaru. Outback.

339
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,860
Hell, l drove up from Dallas one time.

340
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:37,905
That's 850 miles.
l done that in eight hours.

341
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,868
That's, like, over 1 00 miles an hour.

342
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,870
Bart was moving.

343
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,290
Here you go, Davey. Dig in.

344
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,541
Thank you.

345
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,753
Shit, two days from Montana.

346
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,088
Son of a bitch
must have been driving in reverse.

347
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:08,895
Ray's foot's been bothering him.
Ain't that right, Ray?

348
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,855
lt's okay. Just hurts.

349
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,485
Did you get that, Dad?

350
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,112
Dad?

351
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,698
Uncle Ray's foot hurts.

352
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:21,991
l know.

353
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,620
Everything else good, though?

354
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:27,705
Uncle Ray?

355
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,083
Not really.

356
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:35,088
Kate says they got Ross
on the news out there.

357
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,714
Says he's doing real good.

358
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,466
Yup. Yeah, he's doing great.

359
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,510
Well, good for him.

360
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:43,096
He always was a go-getter, wasn't he?

361
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,263
Yup.

362
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:49,560
Two goddamn days from Billings!

363
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:03,342
l used to own this garage.

364
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,929
Own it?
l thought the air compressor guy did.

365
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:08,222
Ed Pegram?

366
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,557
Yeah, l thought he owned it.

367
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,267
We were partners.

368
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,645
What happened?

369
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,439
Sold it to him.

370
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,857
For how much?

371
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,442
$800.

372
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,411
-You need something?
-Hi, yeah.

373
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:32,830
My dad, here, used to own this place.

374
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:34,290
Yeah?

375
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,463
What you fellows got going on, here?

376
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:43,466
We're just replacing
a transmission cooler line.

377
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,011
-You know Ed Pegram?
-Who?

378
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,429
Ed Pegram.

379
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,139
Used to own this place with me.

380
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:01,776
We don't know him.

381
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:04,612
Hey, bud.

382
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:08,533
You're using the wrong wrench.

383
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:10,660
Come on, Dad. Let's get going.

384
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:12,620
Good talking to you.

385
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,540
Moron was using the wrong wrench.

386
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:23,297
Let's see if l know anyone in here.

387
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,729
lt's pretty quiet in here.

388
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:53,661
Hi, fellas. What can l get for you today?

389
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,079
Beer.

390
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,665
Okay, what kind of beer would you like?

391
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,793
Anything's fine. Coors, if you got it.

392
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,169
l'll have a Mountain Dew.

393
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:03,754
Okay, we're out of Coors.

394
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,881
The truck doesn't come in until Monday.

395
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:07,717
Bud's good.

396
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,760
Bud and a Dew, coming up.

397
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,013
Tom Varnik still own this place?

398
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,432
l don't remember that name.

399
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,851
lt must have been before my time.

400
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:24,609
Here we go, guys.

401
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,319
Anything else l can get
for you right now?

402
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:27,403
No, ma'am.

403
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,655
Okay, holler if you need something.

404
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:34,035
l used to know everyone in here.

405
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,329
lt's where you had your first drink?

406
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,622
No.

407
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:40,041
Dad used to let me sip his beer.

408
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:44,378
So, l guess you kept up that
fine family tradition with Ross and me.

409
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:47,757
You liked it, as l recall.

410
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,425
l was, like, six.

411
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:53,220
A sip of beer ain't going to kill you
when you're six years old.

412
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,222
l thought you drank.

413
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,768
Come on.
Have a beer with your old man.

414
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,811
Be somebody.

415
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,731
l've been trying to give it up.

416
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:05,983
What for?

417
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,570
lt was starting to...

418
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,489
lt just wasn't helping.

419
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,908
And now you're all right.

420
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,664
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

421
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,415
Can l have a beer, too, please?

422
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,583
You betcha.

423
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,919
l'm going to drink with my dad.

424
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:55,700
l didn't tell you that Noël and l broke up.

425
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,202
Who?

426
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,370
Noël.

427
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:03,040
The girl l've been
living with for the past two years.

428
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,502
She moved out. We broke up.

429
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:13,467
Maybe l should have
asked her to get married. l don't know.

430
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,177
l just...

431
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,472
l just never felt sure,
you know what l mean?

432
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,938
How are you
supposed to know when you're sure?

433
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,314
Were you sure?

434
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,611
How did you and Mom
end up getting married?

435
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,197
She wanted to.

436
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:36,866
And you didn't?

437
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:39,869
l figured, what the hell.

438
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,331
Were you ever sorry you married her?

439
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,542
All the time.

440
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,336
Could have been worse.

441
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:52,840
You must have been in love.
At least, at first.

442
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,092
Never came up.

443
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,893
Did you ever talk about having kids?

444
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:05,936
How many you wanted
and stuff like that?

445
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,480
Nope.

446
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,982
Then why did you have us?

447
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,569
Because l like to screw.
And your mother is a Catholic.

448
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,529
So, you figure it out.

449
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:18,282
So, you and Mom never
actually talked about

450
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,867
whether you wanted kids or not?

451
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:24,455
l figured if we kept on screwing,
we would end up with a couple of you.

452
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,834
Did you ever think about leaving her?

453
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:33,005
l would just end up with somebody else
who would give me shit all the time.

454
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,132
Yeah, you would.

455
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,467
Yeah.

456
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,303
l'd say she's put up
with your drinking all these years.

457
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,430
l don't drink that much.

458
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,933
-You're an alcoholic.
-Bullshit.

459
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,393
What do you mean, "bullshit"?

460
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,604
l knew you had a problem
when l was eight.

461
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,232
l used to watch you hide
your booze in the garage.

462
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,401
Yeah, you stole it, too.
l figured it was you.

463
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,529
You cost me a lot of money.

464
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,697
Yeah, l poured it out

465
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,991
because l was sick
of seeing you drunk all the time.

466
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,159
l figured it was you.

467
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:05,371
You would never catch your brother
sneaking around like that.

468
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:07,206
l served my country.

469
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,999
l pay my taxes.

470
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,795
And l got a right to do
whatever the goddamn hell l want.

471
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,421
So, l guess you do drink.

472
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,550
-A little bit.
-A lot.

473
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:18,926
All right.

474
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,427
So, l drink a lot!

475
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,513
God damn it, so what?

476
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,140
You do what you want to do, and so do l.

477
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:28,561
You would drink, too,
if you were married to your mother.

478
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:34,316
And it ain't yourjob to tell me
what to do, you little cocksucker.

479
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:47,037
Dad.

480
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:48,873
Dad!

481
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,291
What?

482
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,130
Should l take you back
to Ray and Martha's?

483
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:58,424
l don't know.

484
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:47,431
Say, don't you owe me
a couple of bucks?

485
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:51,852
Christ Almighty, it's Woody Grant.

486
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,397
l don't believe it!
How the hell are you, Woody?

487
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:59,652
God, l never thought
l'd see you back in Hawthorne.

488
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:03,822
Fellas, say hello
to my old friend Woody.

489
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,283
Hello, Woody.

490
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:07,326
Yeah!

491
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,287
Move over. Move over.
Sit down, sit down.

492
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:13,791
l don't believe this.
Jesus Christ, Woody.

493
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,210
So, how you been?

494
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:17,962
-Pretty good.
-Yeah?

495
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,047
Me, too. l can't complain.

496
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,800
Boy, it's been a long time, Woody.

497
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,009
A long time.

498
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,220
Hi, l'm David, Woody's son.

499
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,972
Ed Pegram.

500
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,807
Ed Pegram?

501
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,059
Davey? No shit.

502
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,311
How you doing, guy?

503
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:36,730
You know, the last time
l saw you, you was just a little shaver.

504
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,525
l used to give
you candy bars down at the garage

505
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,151
when you were about this high.

506
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,236
Thank you.

507
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,114
And apparently, my dad used to
give you air compressors.

508
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:46,991
How's that?

509
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,200
Nothing.

510
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,160
Hey, Dad, l'm going to the bathroom.

511
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:55,666
Don't say anything about the money.

512
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,670
You still living up in Billings?

513
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,921
Yeah.

514
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,965
What brings you down here?

515
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,134
l'm just passing through.

516
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,449
Goddamn, Woody Grant is a millionaire!

517
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:29,825
Who would have thought it, huh?

518
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,662
The next round is on Woody.

519
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,980
Come on, Dad.

520
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,914
Did you see the look on their faces?

521
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:18,457
Yeah, l saw.

522
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:24,588
Did you see the look
on those fellas' faces?

523
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:25,232
Well, good morning, boys.

524
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:29,444
Slept in a little late, did you?

525
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:30,571
Morning.

526
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,865
Davey,
get yourself a chair from over there.

527
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:36,201
And, Woody, you sit right on down here.

528
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:38,078
Right there, yeah.

529
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,711
Hungry?

530
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:48,922
Yeah, but it would
be great if you have some...

531
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:51,592
Some coffee.

532
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:56,471
Got a call from
Lowell Meyerson this morning.

533
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:58,557
And Mary Jurak.

534
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,435
Woody, here, is the talk of the town.

535
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,729
ls that right?

536
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:06,982
Why didn't you tell us
you was rich, Woody?

537
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,358
David said not to.

538
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:09,610
He's not rich.

539
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:12,905
You could have told us the real reason
you were coming through town.

540
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:14,781
We're just tickled for you.

541
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,408
You got it on you?

542
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:19,745
Yeah, we sure would like to see
what a million dollars looks like.

543
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:22,706
We still got to go to Lincoln to get it.

544
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,292
Goddamn, you hit the Powerball!

545
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:28,837
Show us the ticket, Uncle Woody.

546
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:31,548
Honestly, he didn't win anything.

547
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:33,091
l didn't win anything.

548
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:34,635
l don't blame you, Woody.

549
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,887
l wouldn't broadcast it either.

550
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,514
Not until l had it in the bank.

551
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,226
You have to watch out for buzzards, too.

552
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,520
Bart and me, we can drive you.

553
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:46,605
Sure.

554
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,482
We could get you to Lincoln in an hour.

555
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,525
Lincoln is over 200 miles.

556
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:54,571
Okay, an hour-and-a-half.
How long would it take you?

557
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:56,240
A day-and-a-half.

558
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,992
Must be nice,
winning that kind of scratch.

559
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:01,286
We're real proud of you, Woody.

560
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:05,457
And l know Ma and Pa
would've been real proud, too.

561
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:10,837
Hell, yeah, it must be nice.

562
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:13,590
ls it nice, Dad?

563
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:15,717
ls what nice?

564
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:17,678
Winning all that money?

565
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,973
Yeah, pretty nice.

566
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:39,074
Hey there, Woody. Remember me?

567
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:42,077
Bernie Bowen, how you doing?

568
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:44,746
Pretty good.

569
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:46,540
That's what l hear.

570
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,793
Everybody's saying how
Woody Grant's a millionaire.

571
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:53,297
Well, that's the most
exciting news around here for ages!

572
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:54,798
lt's no big deal.

573
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,383
No big deal?

574
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,678
Jeez! There's a guy
living the life of Reilly.

575
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,888
A million here, a million there.

576
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,933
The newspaper's gonna
do a big write-up on you.

577
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:06,768
l'm gonna get my picture in the paper?

578
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,312
You bet you will.

579
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:10,731
Dad, here's the bus.

580
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:14,985
Okay. Well, good seeing
you then, Woody.

581
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,695
We're all real happy for you

582
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,031
and real pleased
you thought to stop back home

583
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:20,240
and share the big news.

584
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:21,992
Thanks, Bernie.

585
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,411
Hey, watch your wallet!

586
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:47,934
Thank you.

587
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:49,144
You're welcome.

588
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,939
You both look like hell.

589
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,066
l'm fine.

590
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:57,486
Like hell, you are.
You look like an old drunk.

591
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,446
You're lucky you're not dead.

592
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,864
l haven't been drinking!

593
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,617
That's what you said on our first date!

594
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:06,995
And you. Have you gone bananas?

595
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,375
Almost getting your father killed
over some cockamamie pot of gold.

596
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,460
Mom, come here, please.

597
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:18,006
Mom, look. Go easy on the guy, okay?

598
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:21,676
l mean, you and l both know
that this is not about the money.

599
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:25,597
lt's about, you know, how much longer is
he going to be around?

600
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,474
At least, semi-coherently.

601
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,768
What's the harm
in letting him have his little fantasy

602
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,603
forjust a couple more days?

603
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:34,815
You and Ross,
always fretting over your father.

604
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,525
What about me?

605
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:40,112
What about taking me
out to see my sister in Eau Claire?

606
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:42,072
Your father doesn't
even know what the hell's

607
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,324
going on around him half the time.

608
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:45,951
Do you, Woody?

609
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:47,869
Do l what?

610
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:50,247
Know what's going on around you?

611
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:55,252
You watch it,
or that's what you're gonna turn into.

612
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,379
Now, take me out to the cemetery.

613
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,631
l want to pay my respects.

614
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,091
Martha said she'd have lunch ready.

615
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,759
Martha can wait.

616
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:07,013
Mom.

617
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:08,765
Car's over there.

618
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:43,091
There's Woody's mother, Sara.

619
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:45,177
She hated me.

620
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:47,804
She wanted him to marry someone
who would milk the cows.

621
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:51,892
l said, "l ain't fiddling with no cow titties.
l'm a city girl."

622
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:56,104
The good Lord did not
do Sara any favors

623
00:46:56,189 --> 00:46:58,190
in the looks department.

624
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:01,443
More a man's face
than a woman's, really.

625
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,572
How did she die?

626
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,241
Saw herself in the mirror one day.

627
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:10,952
No.

628
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,454
Cancer!

629
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:16,416
And there's the old Swede, Tolf.

630
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:19,711
Good man, your grandpa.
Never said much.

631
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:22,714
That farm just ruined him.

632
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:28,136
You're lucky l took you away from there.

633
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,806
And there's Woody's brother, David.

634
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:33,892
You were named after him.

635
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:39,523
He died of scarlet fever
when he was only two.

636
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:44,027
Woody slept in the same bed
with him and never got it.

637
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,242
There's Woody's little sister, Rose.

638
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,786
She was only 1 9

639
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,872
when she was killed
in a car wreck near Wausa.

640
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:58,625
-What a whore.
-Mom...

641
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:02,045
No, l liked Rose.
But, my God, she was a slut.

642
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:05,048
-Come on.
-l'm just telling you the truth.

643
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:08,802
She was screwing guys
in the back of Hawthorne Creamery

644
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,554
when she was only 1 5.

645
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,681
Come on, Mom. Jesus.

646
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,393
Where's your family?

647
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:18,937
They're over in the Catholic cemetery.

648
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,772
Catholics wouldn't
be caught dead around

649
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,233
all these damn Lutherans.

650
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:27,028
Here's Delmer, Woody's cousin.

651
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,281
He was a drunk.

652
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:33,118
One time,
we were wrestling, and he felt me up.

653
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:34,661
Grabbed a handful of boob,

654
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,997
and Woody was right there
and didn't have a clue.

655
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:38,915
-Did you, Woody?
-Jesus, Mom.

656
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:44,879
Well, my goodness.

657
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:48,174
l didn't know Keith White was here.

658
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:50,719
When did he die?

659
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,138
Keith White.

660
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:57,475
He wanted in my pants,
too, but he was so boring.

661
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,106
See what you could've had, Keith,

662
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,109
if you hadn't
talked about wheat all the time?

663
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:17,454
Peggy Huntsucker is pregnant.

664
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:19,122
Peggy got knocked up again?

665
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,374
-Yeah.
-At her age?

666
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,460
That old cow must be 50.

667
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:25,295
She just looks 50.

668
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,422
That's what pig farming will do to you.

669
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:41,311
So, you got any other cars?

670
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,772
No, just that one.

671
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:46,608
What's the engine?

672
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,902
lt's a four-cylinder.

673
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,571
Yeah, but what size?

674
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:54,074
l don't really know.

675
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:56,534
What's your brother drive?

676
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:58,036
Who, Ross?

677
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,789
Yeah. What does he drive?

678
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:06,252
Ross has a Kia Rondo,
and Marcie has a Nissan Pathfinder,

679
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:09,214
because she carts the kids around a lot.

680
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,966
So, you all got Jap cars?

681
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:14,010
Actually, Kia is Korean.

682
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:31,319
Hey, is this
where l can find Mr. Woody Grant?

683
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:33,446
Who wants to know?

684
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,824
l was sent by Mrs. Nagy

685
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:38,076
atthe Hawthorne RepubIican
to take his picture.

686
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:42,247
Yeah, he's here.

687
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:45,792
And they want him to be sure
to drop by the office for an interview.

688
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:28,334
Hello?

689
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:30,962
Hello!

690
00:51:34,884 --> 00:51:35,967
Yes?

691
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,677
Hi, are you Mrs. Nagy?

692
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:38,762
Yes.

693
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:41,097
l'm David Grant, Woody Grant's son.

694
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:44,392
l'm very pleased to meet you.

695
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:47,979
Your father is
certainly quite the celebrity around here.

696
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:50,148
That's what l came to tell you about.

697
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:53,276
Dad didn't win any lottery,
or sweepstakes, or anything.

698
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,279
He's a little confused
about something he got in the mail,

699
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,072
and it's gotten way out of hand.

700
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:00,700
So, he didn't win a million dollars?

701
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:02,285
No, ma'am.

702
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,622
lt just goes to show you,
some things never change.

703
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:07,916
He was always a little confused.

704
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,710
You knew my dad?

705
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:14,130
lt's ancient history now,
and l don't want to speak out of turn,

706
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:17,091
but Woody and l used to go together.

707
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:18,301
You were his girlfriend?

708
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,094
That's right.

709
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:21,513
What happened?

710
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:23,765
Your mother is what happened.

711
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,058
How is Kate?

712
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,477
Fine. She's here, too.

713
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:30,313
You tell her Peg Bender says hello.

714
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,565
Okay. She won't slap me, will she?

715
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,401
Why would she? She won.

716
00:52:37,238 --> 00:52:39,030
lt's water under the bridge.

717
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:42,742
Don't get me wrong,
l married a wonderful man.

718
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:45,870
We ran this newspaper
together until he died.

719
00:52:45,955 --> 00:52:49,666
Had three children, eight grandchildren.

720
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,459
l've got no complaints.

721
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,256
Was Woody drinking back then?

722
00:52:56,924 --> 00:53:00,552
Of course he was.
lt happens early around here.

723
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:03,346
There's really not much else to do.

724
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,682
Nowadays, of course,
it's not just the booze,

725
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:07,559
but all the other stuff.

726
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:10,353
For Woody, it got bad after Korea.

727
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,272
He had a hard time over there.

728
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:14,607
l thought he was just a mechanic.

729
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:17,026
He was, for the army planes.

730
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:19,696
But he was shot down,
being transferred.

731
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:22,532
You knew that, right?

732
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:51,978
Here. Let me get that.

733
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,438
Thank you.

734
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,456
Here it is.

735
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:14,667
-Woody, Ray and Albert.
-Wow!

736
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,715
Wow, they look like kids.

737
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,384
Your dad was never much of a talker,

738
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:26,971
and when he came back,
he hardly said a word.

739
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:29,766
But always very kind.

740
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:32,018
People took advantage of him.

741
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,562
He just couldn't turn down a favor.

742
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,899
Now that everyone thinks
he's a millionaire,

743
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,901
he's a big hero around here.

744
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,612
Well, l'm sorry l can't print that he is,

745
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:45,198
but l won't print that he isn't, either.

746
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:50,119
l'll just do a little story on him and Kate
stopping through town.

747
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:54,040
lt's hard to imagine you and my mother
fighting over the same man.

748
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,167
l knew l didn't have a chance, anyway.

749
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,335
Yeah?

750
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,879
l wouldn't let him round the bases.

751
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:26,114
You say go sIow

752
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:28,741
l fall behind

753
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,120
What are you having, old man?

754
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:33,788
Meatloaf.

755
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:36,165
You've been
staring at that menu for 1 0 minutes.

756
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:39,085
Where does it say "meatloaf"?

757
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,004
They ought to have meatloaf.

758
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:43,715
Well, they don't, so pick something else.

759
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:45,967
Are we ready to order?

760
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,343
l knew it.

761
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:49,679
Dad, do you know what you want?

762
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,306
Do you have meatloaf?

763
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:53,433
No, l'm sorry, we don't.

764
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:55,685
That's only on the lunch buffet.

765
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:57,562
Chicken, then.

766
00:55:57,646 --> 00:56:01,232
Do you want the fried chicken,
or the flame-broiled chicken breast?

767
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:03,901
-Fried.
-He'll have the flame-broiled.

768
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:05,737
And for you, ma'am?

769
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:08,156
l was thinking about
having the roast beef,

770
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,782
but now l'm not sure.

771
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:12,493
What do you recommend?
What's good here?

772
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:15,788
lt's all good,
but l'm kind of partial to the tilapia.

773
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,499
No, l want the roast beef.

774
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:21,169
l'll have the tilapia.

775
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,297
Don't forget to help yourselves
to the soup and salad bar.

776
00:56:28,761 --> 00:56:31,763
On a cold and gray Chicago morning

777
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:35,725
A poor IittIe baby chiId
is born in the ghetto

778
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,562
That's Ed Pegram singing.

779
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,648
And his mamma cries

780
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,612
'Cause if there's
one thing that she don't need

781
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:50,364
It's another hungry mouth to feed

782
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,158
In the ghetto

783
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:57,497
PeopIe don't you understand

784
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,750
He always did have a nice voice.

785
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:03,419
lt was the only nice thing
about that bastard.

786
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:05,588
-He's all right.
-"All right"?

787
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:09,133
Did you know that he was always
trying to get in my bloomers?

788
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:12,303
Jesus, Mom. Was the whole town
trying to seduce you?

789
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:16,808
These boys grow up staring at
the rear ends of cows and pigs.

790
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:20,186
lt's only natural that a real woman
will get them chafing their pants.

791
00:57:20,813 --> 00:57:23,940
Mom, please don't talk about
that kind of stuff right before we eat.

792
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:28,111
You were always such a sensitive boy.

793
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:30,196
And such a beautiful boy.

794
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:32,740
Why, when you were a baby,

795
00:57:32,825 --> 00:57:37,453
people used to stop me on the street
and tell me how beautiful you were.

796
00:57:37,538 --> 00:57:39,330
A lot of them thought you were a girl.

797
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:41,958
lsn't that right, Woody?

798
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:43,459
l don't know.

799
00:57:43,544 --> 00:57:45,962
Ladies and gentIemen,
l have an announcement to make.

800
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:49,006
We have a ceIebrity
in our midst this evening.

801
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:52,593
My good friend and the rich man
you've aII been hearing about,

802
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:54,387
Mr. Woody Grant!

803
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,763
Stand up and take a bow, Woody.

804
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:00,810
Stand up, Dad.

805
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,229
Don't encourage this nonsense.

806
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,815
Dad, stand up. Stand up, it's for you.

807
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,109
Just do it and get it over with.

808
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:16,659
Take a bow, Woody!

809
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:18,244
Hey!

810
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:38,097
Okay, you ham, that's enough.

811
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:43,269
RosIyn, you're going to be getting
a big tip from that tabIe tonight.

812
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:51,694
Hey, little Davey!

813
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:52,820
Hello, Mr. Pegram.

814
00:58:52,905 --> 00:58:54,655
l was hoping l'd run into you.

815
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,032
Yeah?

816
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,035
What can l do for you?

817
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,663
l just wanted you to know,
l think the world of Woody.

818
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:04,707
Always a good man.

819
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:05,791
Thank you.

820
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:07,501
Heart of gold.

821
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:09,212
lt's no secret, though.

822
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:12,131
He drank quite a bit
when we had the garage,

823
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:16,177
and he messed up a lot ofjobs,
and let lots of money walk.

824
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:19,430
He was older than me.
Kind of like a big brother.

825
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:21,474
Korea vet, the whole nine yards.

826
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,935
And l wanted to
show him some respect,

827
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:28,189
so l loaned him a ton of dough,
and l never saw it again.

828
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:33,027
So, seeing as how
he's come into some cash lately,

829
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:36,614
some no-fooling-around cash
that he didn't even have to work for,

830
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:40,493
it seems to me only fair if we settled up.

831
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,746
So, you want your $800 back.

832
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:47,500
Woody owes me a lot more than that.

833
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,921
l'm sorry to break it to you,
but my dad didn't win anything.

834
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,965
lt's all a big misunderstanding.

835
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:56,550
You know Woody,
you can understand that.

836
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:58,844
Right, so you're all
headed down to Lincoln

837
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:01,597
to visit the roller skating museum, huh?

838
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:05,434
Look, Davey, l really don't want to have
to bring a lawyer into this.

839
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:06,519
Lawyer?

840
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:10,856
What's the statute
of limitations on bullshit?

841
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,818
Davey, Davey.

842
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:18,406
l'm a man with
a real strong sense of right and wrong.

843
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:22,368
And if Woody hit it rich
and l don't see any of it

844
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,245
that would be wrong.

845
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,789
And l will make it right.

846
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:31,335
Are you threatening my family?

847
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:35,548
Threatening? No, that would be wrong.

848
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:39,260
Hey, l'm the victim here.

849
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:43,222
lt's just food for thought.

850
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,643
Now, if you'll excuse me,
l've got to take a leak real bad.

851
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:50,730
You know beer, you just rent the stuff.

852
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:05,995
Great to see you again, Woody.
We're real happy for you.

853
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,165
Buy a boat and go fishing.
That's what l'd do.

854
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:10,916
l just might.

855
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:15,796
David, you probably don't remember
Kathy and Dale Slaasted.

856
01:01:16,757 --> 01:01:18,424
-David.
-Hi. How are you?

857
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:19,800
David Grant.

858
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:22,887
l never would've
recognized you in a million years.

859
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:25,222
You were such a beautiful little boy.

860
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:27,767
l keep telling him. You see?

861
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:30,478
Like a little prince
made out of porcelain.

862
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:31,562
Thank you.

863
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:33,356
Well, you all take care.

864
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,858
And enjoy spending the loot.

865
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,610
Enjoy.

866
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:45,034
l just had an interesting conversation
with Ed Pegram in the men's room.

867
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,285
What did he want?

868
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:47,620
Some of Dad's money.

869
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,873
l can loan him
a couple bucks if he's hard up.

870
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:53,250
Like hell, you will.

871
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:26,492
Hey, you. Wake up!

872
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:30,204
Wake up. Now.

873
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:32,998
What's up, Dad? What's wrong?

874
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,209
Are we going to Lincoln today?

875
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:36,585
Tomorrow.

876
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:38,212
Why not today?

877
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,090
Today is Sunday. Lincoln is closed.

878
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:43,676
And all your brothers are
coming over today. Remember?

879
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:45,678
Some of them are dead.

880
01:02:46,221 --> 01:02:48,222
The dead ones won't be here.

881
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,852
But God damn it.

882
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:56,355
lf l don't get to that money,
they're gonna give it to somebody else.

883
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:00,651
Hey, Dad.

884
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:03,529
Do you remember a gal
you used to go out with

885
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,322
named Peg Bender?

886
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:07,658
-Who?
-Peg Bender.

887
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,035
l don't know. When?

888
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:12,246
Last week. What do you mean, "When"?

889
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,248
Years ago, before you were married.

890
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,752
lt was a long time ago.

891
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:22,381
What are you bringing that up for?

892
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,056
Snap to Cutler.

893
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:32,850
Back on five, tight pocket.
Throws it over the middle,

894
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,143
batted up in the air by Aromashodu.

895
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,020
He makes the grab
and a first down to midfield.

896
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:38,606
Left to the 45. Leaping to the 40.

897
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:42,026
Hit hard from behind
to the Lion 38-yard-Iine.

898
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:43,486
Great hands!

899
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:47,448
Devin Aromashodu batted it to himself,
and it's a first down to the Bears.

900
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:52,119
l didn't see your boys out there, Martha.
Where are Cole and Bart?

901
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:55,831
They're out volunteering today.

902
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:58,751
Picking up trash, out on the highway.

903
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,586
They'll be home in time for supper.

904
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:01,921
That's nice.

905
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:05,257
lt's community service,
on account of Cole's rape.

906
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:08,093
Sexual assault, not rape.

907
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:09,386
Well, what's the difference?

908
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,096
There's a big difference.

909
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:13,224
Cole can explain it better than l can.

910
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:14,934
And Bart doesn't have to be there.

911
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:16,602
He's volunteering.

912
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,312
That's nice!

913
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:21,357
Bears come out
for their third possession.

914
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:22,691
Hey, for a Iimited time,

915
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:25,736
Ruth's Chris Steak House
is offering Ruth's Classic.

916
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,197
Verne, do you still drive a Chevy?

917
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:29,615
A what?

918
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:34,161
A Chevy. That lmpala you used to have.

919
01:04:34,955 --> 01:04:36,956
l never had an lmpala.

920
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:42,086
Well, hell,
l don't know what it was, then.

921
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:49,635
l had a Buick.

922
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:52,596
That's what it was.

923
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:54,723
Are you still driving that?

924
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:56,976
l haven't had that for years.

925
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:59,478
l thought you still had it.

926
01:05:04,276 --> 01:05:06,151
lt was a '78, wasn't it?

927
01:05:06,695 --> 01:05:07,820
'79.

928
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:11,490
'79. Those were good cars.

929
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:14,618
lt was okay.

930
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:17,997
They don't make them
like that anymore.

931
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:21,333
Those cars will run forever.

932
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:25,504
Whatever happened to it?

933
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:27,506
lt stopped running.

934
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:30,384
Well, they'll do that.

935
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:34,096
Hello!

936
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,514
Come in!

937
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:40,394
Hey, everybody.

938
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:42,313
Hi, Ross.

939
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:43,981
How about Marcie and the kids?

940
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:46,233
Dance recital.

941
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:50,738
Who's playing?

942
01:05:51,406 --> 01:05:53,198
Chicago and Detroit.

943
01:05:54,034 --> 01:05:56,452
How long did it take you to drive?

944
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,967
So, Uncle Woody, did you get over
and talk to the newspaper yet?

945
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,303
Not yet.

946
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:17,056
They sent a kid around
to take my picture.

947
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:19,892
l went by the office
and gave them the lowdown.

948
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,273
What's it like
being a millionaire, Woody?

949
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:29,735
lt's okay.

950
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:33,697
A million dollars. Can you beat that?

951
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:37,159
Let's raise a glass
to Kate and Woody, here.

952
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:38,702
To Kate and Woody!

953
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:47,419
Not to be a spoilsport,
but you all know this is bull.

954
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:49,129
l mean, Dad didn't win anything.

955
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,048
Nice try, Ross.

956
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:52,966
Yeah, we're way beyond that.

957
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:55,511
Ross is right. He didn't.

958
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:57,805
Trying to keep it quiet,
so everybody don't come around

959
01:06:57,889 --> 01:06:59,807
looking for a handout, huh, Kate?

960
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:01,517
That's good thinking.

961
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:02,768
No, that's right.

962
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,436
Woody ain't no millionaire yet.

963
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:06,397
We all got to remember that.

964
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:09,441
But come tomorrow,
that's a different story.

965
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:13,237
What's the first thing you're going to do
with the money, Woody?

966
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:15,114
The very first thing.

967
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:19,034
Get a truck. And a compressor.

968
01:07:20,412 --> 01:07:23,205
What the hell
are you gonna do with a compressor?

969
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,790
l need it to paint.

970
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,167
Are you still working, Woody?

971
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:29,503
No.

972
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:32,589
He just needs to replace
the compressor that Ed Pegram stole.

973
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:35,801
Why don't you just go down
and get it from him while you're in town?

974
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:39,388
David, let's go get it.

975
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:41,932
You boys will do no such thing.

976
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:45,102
Get yourselves shot
for an old piece of garbage?

977
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:47,855
Am l the only sane one in this family?

978
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:49,481
Okay, Mom. Fine.

979
01:07:50,525 --> 01:07:53,527
But, hey, Ross, l was thinking
we could take a drive later,

980
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:55,028
and see Dad's old house.

981
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:56,739
The old Grant house.

982
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:57,906
Do you think it's still there?

983
01:07:58,283 --> 01:08:01,744
Dan Conway farms the place,
but he never tore it down.

984
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:02,911
lt's still sitting there.

985
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:05,330
Why would you want
to waste your time seeing that?

986
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:08,417
Must be filled with rats.

987
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:12,337
Dad, want to take a drive later
and see the old homestead?

988
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:13,505
The what?

989
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:16,383
David and l want
to go see where you grew up.

990
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:18,218
What for?

991
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,824
What's Uncle Albert doing?

992
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:44,411
He's watching cars go by.

993
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:46,872
Remember when they came out
to visit when we were kids,

994
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,749
and he'd take a chair out
in the front yard

995
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:51,043
every evening to watch the road?

996
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:52,669
Yeah.

997
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:55,172
Hi, David. Hi, Ross.

998
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:59,134
lt sure is good to see you boys again.

999
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:02,137
We just can't let
this much time pass again.

1000
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,431
-Yeah.
-Yeah, thanks, Aunt Betty.

1001
01:09:04,516 --> 01:09:06,099
lt's great seeing you again, too.

1002
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:10,229
But there is something,
and it's kind of hard to bring up.

1003
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:12,940
We feel it deserves mentioning.

1004
01:09:13,024 --> 01:09:14,274
What's that?

1005
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:16,235
Well...

1006
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:18,654
Well, you may not know it,

1007
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:21,490
but Woody always had
a lot of money problems,

1008
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:24,993
and the family
would help him out from time to time.

1009
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:27,830
So, in light of his good fortune,

1010
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:32,459
well, we thought your family
might want to make things right.

1011
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:35,003
l've been hearing that a lot lately.

1012
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,421
You know, Cole's and my folks

1013
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:39,550
would never say nothing
if it was just for them,

1014
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:41,426
but they're gonna need
in on this deal, too.

1015
01:09:41,845 --> 01:09:44,346
Are you saying
you want money from us?

1016
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:48,684
We just figured, seeing as how
the family took care of Woody and all,

1017
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:50,519
and kept him on his feet.

1018
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:54,606
Verne and l loaned Woody quite a bit,
and it wasn't like we was rich.

1019
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:56,358
But he was my brother-in-law,

1020
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:58,735
and we couldn't stand
to see the family suffer.

1021
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:04,199
Look, Aunt Betty,
and, guys, hey, for real, honestly, right?

1022
01:10:04,284 --> 01:10:05,701
Woody didn't win anything.

1023
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:07,578
This is a total sham.

1024
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:09,580
You're a damn liar!

1025
01:10:09,664 --> 01:10:11,748
Don't feed us any of your bullshit, Ross.

1026
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:13,959
You want to go?

1027
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:15,502
Let's do it!

1028
01:10:17,297 --> 01:10:18,338
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

1029
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:23,176
Hey, watch my face, okay? l'm on TV.

1030
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:25,512
Get him, Bart!

1031
01:10:30,435 --> 01:10:31,602
What's going on?

1032
01:10:31,686 --> 01:10:34,438
Have you boys lost your minds?

1033
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:38,775
Aunt Betty and her henchmen
here are asking for reparations.

1034
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,235
For what?

1035
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,237
They're after Dad's "winnings." Right?

1036
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:44,114
They say we owe them money.

1037
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:45,741
See? There is money.

1038
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:47,200
"Owe them money"?

1039
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:49,745
What on Earth
are you talking about, Betty?

1040
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:52,664
Now, Kate, you know
we helped you and Woody out

1041
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:55,083
when he was drinking up
everything he earned.

1042
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:58,211
You know as well as l do
it was the other way around.

1043
01:10:58,296 --> 01:11:01,423
You were always
having him work on your cars for free,

1044
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:02,841
getting free gas.

1045
01:11:02,926 --> 01:11:05,928
Aunt Kate, we're not asking for much.
Just a token.

1046
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:07,346
l kept records.

1047
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:11,600
The money you gave him
didn't come close to what you owed.

1048
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:15,354
He couldn't say no to anybody,
and it ruined him.

1049
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:18,273
l think you're having
a senior moment, here, Kate.

1050
01:11:18,358 --> 01:11:20,192
Just where do you think
that money come from

1051
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:21,902
when you got a bee in your bonnet

1052
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:24,488
to move up to Billings
and open up that salon?

1053
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:28,450
From my folks when they croaked,
that's where!

1054
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:31,119
l don't believe the nerve of you people.

1055
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:35,040
Usually a person has to die
before the vultures start circling.

1056
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:38,543
Calm down, Aunt Katie.
We didn't mean nothing by it.

1057
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:41,797
We was just doing you a courtesy
before we go talk to Woody direct.

1058
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:46,301
Don't you dare think about asking
that poor man for money.

1059
01:11:46,386 --> 01:11:47,970
He ain't poor. He's rich.

1060
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:50,973
Even if he was,
he wouldn't give you a blessed penny.

1061
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:52,975
l'd put my foot down!

1062
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:55,227
Maybe it ain't up to you, Aunt Kate.

1063
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:56,770
That's enough.

1064
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:58,981
You listen real good.

1065
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:03,652
You can all just go fuck yourselves!

1066
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:07,030
Boys, get your dad.

1067
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:44,002
What do you think, old man?

1068
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:46,004
Looks about the same.

1069
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:47,506
That's true.

1070
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:50,175
This is about how your mother kept it.

1071
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:56,681
My dad built this place.

1072
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:58,517
Really?

1073
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:01,645
Wait. You don't mean, by himself?

1074
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:04,106
Yeah. Before l was born.

1075
01:14:06,109 --> 01:14:07,901
His brothers helped.

1076
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:45,147
l got it. l got it.

1077
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,365
This was my room.

1078
01:14:56,742 --> 01:15:00,078
That's where
Woody's brother David died.

1079
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:03,957
Do you remember that, Dad?

1080
01:15:05,877 --> 01:15:07,252
l was there.

1081
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:44,414
This was my parents' room.

1082
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:49,920
l'd get whipped if they found me in here.

1083
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:55,967
l guess nobody's gonna whip me now.

1084
01:16:08,356 --> 01:16:10,482
The barn is still standing.

1085
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,344
Have you seen enough?

1086
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:41,513
l suppose.

1087
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:45,684
lt's just a bunch
of old wood and some weeds.

1088
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:55,527
Did you ever want a farm like your dad?

1089
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,865
l don't remember.

1090
01:17:02,702 --> 01:17:04,536
And it doesn't matter.

1091
01:17:23,681 --> 01:17:25,807
There's the O'Hare farm.

1092
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:28,143
She's dead.

1093
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:30,729
He's in a nursing home in Valentine.

1094
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:33,898
And one of their little brats
still lives there.

1095
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:42,032
And there's Ed Pegram's
place on the right.

1096
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:48,413
What are you doing?

1097
01:17:49,123 --> 01:17:50,206
Let's do it.

1098
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:51,708
We're right here.

1099
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,753
What are you boys up to now?

1100
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:57,797
Hey, Dad, don't you want to see
if he still has your compressor?

1101
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:52,185
Will you two knock off this foolishness?

1102
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:50,827
Hey, Dad, you finally
got your compressor back.

1103
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:55,206
That's not my compressor.

1104
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:57,208
Sure it is.

1105
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:00,378
Mine didn't look anything like that.

1106
01:20:00,463 --> 01:20:02,297
lt has to be yours.

1107
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:05,133
lt's an old compressor
we found in Ed Pegram's barn.

1108
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:07,760
That wasn't Ed's barn.

1109
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:10,388
What are you talking about?

1110
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:12,932
That's the Westendorf place.

1111
01:20:13,017 --> 01:20:14,809
That's right.

1112
01:20:15,186 --> 01:20:17,020
Right, the Westendorfs.

1113
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:20,732
The Pegrams live closer to town.

1114
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:22,942
l got confused.

1115
01:20:23,277 --> 01:20:24,652
Ed and his wife Dorothy.

1116
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:26,905
God, what a pig she was.

1117
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:29,866
Anything you want to say
about the Westendorfs?

1118
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:32,285
No, they're good folks.

1119
01:20:32,912 --> 01:20:35,246
They had some tough times.

1120
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:37,123
They lost a child.

1121
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:38,791
Almost went broke,

1122
01:20:38,876 --> 01:20:41,377
but they worked hard
and saved the farm.

1123
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:43,671
Salt of the Earth, the Westendorfs.

1124
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:47,133
They really didn't deserve
what you boys did to them.

1125
01:20:47,593 --> 01:20:49,969
Dad, why didn't
you tell us that wasn't Ed's house?

1126
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:52,305
l didn't know
what the hell you were doing.

1127
01:20:52,932 --> 01:20:55,266
Have you ever seen us
steal machinery before?

1128
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:58,061
Well, l never know
what you boys are up to.

1129
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:01,105
Well, why didn't you say it wasn't yours?

1130
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,899
l thought you wanted it.

1131
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:05,652
What do we want
an old compressor for?

1132
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,571
That's what l couldn't figure out.

1133
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:23,104
Hi, George.

1134
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:24,480
Hi, Jean.

1135
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:27,275
Remember us? Kate and Woody Grant?

1136
01:22:27,735 --> 01:22:30,111
-Sure. How you doing?
-Just fine.

1137
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:34,574
We were passing by
and thought we'd stop in.

1138
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:37,452
Haven't been in Hawthorne
for a long time.

1139
01:22:37,536 --> 01:22:39,704
Well, what are you doing
in the back seat?

1140
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:47,587
We were just resting back here
until you showed up.

1141
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:49,922
You want to come in for a visit?

1142
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:54,385
Sorry, we just have time
to say hi and get going.

1143
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:58,306
Hi there, Woody. How you doing?

1144
01:22:58,766 --> 01:23:01,643
Good, George. How about yourself?

1145
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:03,186
Getting by.

1146
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:05,229
You still up there in Montana?

1147
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:06,314
Yep.

1148
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:07,899
Billings, isn't it?

1149
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:09,609
That's right.

1150
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:11,986
You still fixing hair out there, Kate?

1151
01:23:12,071 --> 01:23:14,906
No, l let that go.

1152
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:16,407
You did.

1153
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:27,377
Well, good to see you folks.

1154
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:30,922
l'd better get up front
and drive us back to town.

1155
01:23:33,425 --> 01:23:35,343
-lt's so good to see you.
-Good to see you.

1156
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:36,469
Call us sometime.

1157
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:38,429
l will. Bye-bye.

1158
01:23:53,821 --> 01:23:55,279
Bye-bye.

1159
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:28,771
You were right, Mom.

1160
01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:30,690
The Westendorfs look
like real nice people.

1161
01:24:30,774 --> 01:24:32,400
l tried to tell you.

1162
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:36,863
What do you want to do now,
bust into a silo and steal some corn?

1163
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:40,283
-Let me drive.
-No, l'll drive.

1164
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:06,017
What time do you figure
we'll be shoving off in the morning?

1165
01:25:07,186 --> 01:25:09,353
l think 8:00 sounds about right.

1166
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:12,231
You want another beer?

1167
01:25:12,316 --> 01:25:13,858
l suppose.

1168
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:17,028
Hey there, Davey-boy,
make some room.

1169
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,363
How's it going, cowboy?

1170
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:21,407
Well, it was going fine.

1171
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:23,451
Woody.

1172
01:25:24,036 --> 01:25:25,286
Ed.

1173
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:30,124
Well, enough of this chit-chat,
it's time to get down to business.

1174
01:25:30,209 --> 01:25:32,210
Woody, l tried to tell your boy

1175
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:36,631
that you wouldn't mind
using some of your winnings

1176
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:39,550
to even the score with your old pal Ed.

1177
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:42,178
Well, how much you need?

1178
01:25:42,262 --> 01:25:43,805
l got a 20.

1179
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:46,432
A 20? No, no, no.

1180
01:25:46,517 --> 01:25:49,894
No, no. l was thinking more
along the lines of, say...

1181
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:51,562
1 0 grand.

1182
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:53,231
Give him 1 0 grand, Dad.

1183
01:25:53,816 --> 01:25:55,399
l don't got it yet.

1184
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:56,567
Woody...

1185
01:25:57,069 --> 01:25:59,403
l always thought we was friends.

1186
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:03,324
Remember, l was the one
that convinced you to stay with Kate.

1187
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:06,410
Yeah, Davey.
Your dad wanted to get a divorce

1188
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:09,080
because he was screwing some
half-breed down at the reservation.

1189
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:10,998
He thought he was in love.

1190
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:12,917
Ain't that right, Woody?

1191
01:26:20,342 --> 01:26:22,093
When was this, Dad?

1192
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:25,221
After Ross was born. Before you.

1193
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:28,182
You know, if l hadn't been around,
you might not even be here.

1194
01:26:28,267 --> 01:26:30,351
Back then, divorce was a sin.

1195
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:32,395
Nowadays, l guess it's okay.

1196
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:34,647
God must have changed his mind
or something.

1197
01:26:36,775 --> 01:26:38,693
Although, l really didn't
blame you, Woody,

1198
01:26:38,777 --> 01:26:42,446
because Kate was always a bitch.

1199
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:45,116
Get the hell away from us.

1200
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,409
l want that money.

1201
01:26:46,493 --> 01:26:47,618
Move.

1202
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,787
Okay, little Davey.

1203
01:26:50,372 --> 01:26:52,081
Have it your way.

1204
01:26:52,499 --> 01:26:58,671
But this is the last time
that old Eddie-boy is gonna play nice.

1205
01:27:33,206 --> 01:27:35,416
l got it! l got it!

1206
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,377
Dad, are you okay?

1207
01:27:38,462 --> 01:27:40,338
They took my letter.

1208
01:28:05,572 --> 01:28:06,906
Hey, David.

1209
01:28:07,407 --> 01:28:08,449
Where is it?

1210
01:28:08,533 --> 01:28:09,867
Where's what?

1211
01:28:09,952 --> 01:28:11,535
Just give it back.

1212
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:14,455
l don't know what
you're talking about, buddy.

1213
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:15,873
Cole, do you know?

1214
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:17,458
Of course not.

1215
01:28:20,045 --> 01:28:21,420
Where is it?

1216
01:28:23,882 --> 01:28:24,966
We don't got it.

1217
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:26,801
Shut the fuck up, Cole!

1218
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:30,805
We tossed it
when we saw how bogus it was.

1219
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:35,226
A millionaire? What a joke.
You people are pathetic.

1220
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:05,923
l won't mention
any of this to Mom or Ross.

1221
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:09,719
We'll just tell them that
you came to your senses,

1222
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:11,095
and we'll head back home.

1223
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:12,555
Sound good?

1224
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:15,433
lt's okay.

1225
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:17,977
At least we had
a little change of scenery.

1226
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:21,022
And l'm happy that
we got this time together.

1227
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:22,440
Aren't you?

1228
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:31,532
Maybe they dropped it.

1229
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:33,117
Should we go have a look?

1230
01:29:52,554 --> 01:29:55,139
l think it was easier to find your teeth.

1231
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:06,484
Hey, Dad.

1232
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:09,403
Let's take a break.

1233
01:30:25,629 --> 01:30:31,050
Now, just imagine what you could do
with one million dollars, Woodrow.

1234
01:30:31,134 --> 01:30:33,094
But we all know what
the son of a bitch would do.

1235
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:35,471
He'd buy a truck.

1236
01:30:37,474 --> 01:30:40,851
"To collect your prize
you just have to return this letter

1237
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:44,522
"to our office,
along with your winning prize number

1238
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:49,944
"and a list of the magazine
subscriptions you would like."

1239
01:30:50,028 --> 01:30:53,531
Hey there, Woody!
l was just looking for you.

1240
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:55,825
Somebody found
your precious sweepstakes notice

1241
01:30:55,909 --> 01:30:57,284
out on the street.

1242
01:30:57,369 --> 01:30:59,078
You better take
better care of this, Woody.

1243
01:30:59,162 --> 01:31:01,038
You wouldn't want to lose it again.

1244
01:32:34,925 --> 01:32:36,592
Dad, what's the matter?

1245
01:32:36,676 --> 01:32:37,801
l'm dizzy.

1246
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:40,304
Okay. Let's get you to a doctor.
Come on.

1247
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:42,848
Get me back to the house.

1248
01:32:42,933 --> 01:32:44,433
We're going to Lincoln in the morning.

1249
01:32:44,517 --> 01:32:46,060
No, we're not going to Lincoln.

1250
01:32:46,144 --> 01:32:47,603
Yes, we are.

1251
01:32:47,687 --> 01:32:49,063
No. Come on.

1252
01:32:49,147 --> 01:32:50,856
Let me sit down a minute.

1253
01:32:55,737 --> 01:32:56,904
Okay.

1254
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:06,997
Dad, this is it, okay?
This is where it stops.

1255
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:12,002
Your head is busted open,
and now you can barely stand up.

1256
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:13,796
You promised.

1257
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,214
You didn't win!

1258
01:33:15,298 --> 01:33:17,216
Okay? Can't you get
that through your head?

1259
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:22,179
And we're not driving down to Lincoln
over a stupid fantasy!

1260
01:33:22,722 --> 01:33:25,557
lt's my own damn fault
for taking you this far.

1261
01:33:31,523 --> 01:33:33,524
You've got enough money to get by.

1262
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:34,817
You can't drive.

1263
01:33:35,527 --> 01:33:37,027
What's the point?

1264
01:33:38,405 --> 01:33:40,239
l want a new truck.

1265
01:33:40,323 --> 01:33:42,825
Why do you need a truck so bad?

1266
01:33:42,909 --> 01:33:47,329
Just to have it.
l always wanted a brand-new truck.

1267
01:33:48,498 --> 01:33:49,790
Well, what about the rest of the money?

1268
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:52,793
You don't need a million dollars
for a damn pickup truck.

1269
01:33:57,757 --> 01:33:59,800
lt's for you boys.

1270
01:34:00,343 --> 01:34:02,678
l wanted to leave you something.

1271
01:34:08,935 --> 01:34:12,396
We're fine, Dad. We don't need it.

1272
01:34:14,858 --> 01:34:17,401
l just wanted to leave you something.

1273
01:34:26,953 --> 01:34:31,123
You know if there
was any chance you won, l'd take you.

1274
01:34:31,624 --> 01:34:33,083
You know that, right?

1275
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:35,753
l wouldn't lie to you.

1276
01:34:36,129 --> 01:34:37,421
l know.

1277
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:41,508
Look, the only reason
l agreed to take you to Lincoln

1278
01:34:41,593 --> 01:34:46,347
was to get out of Billings for a while,
and maybe have some time with you.

1279
01:34:46,765 --> 01:34:48,557
And to get you to shut up.

1280
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:51,685
All right.

1281
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:53,562
All right, what?

1282
01:34:53,646 --> 01:34:55,230
l'll shut up.

1283
01:34:57,484 --> 01:34:59,360
And what about Lincoln?

1284
01:35:01,321 --> 01:35:03,072
We don't have to go.

1285
01:35:04,032 --> 01:35:05,324
Good.

1286
01:35:07,452 --> 01:35:08,911
Dad! Dad.

1287
01:35:46,866 --> 01:35:48,033
Hey.

1288
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:52,788
So, they can keep him here
until tomorrow afternoon or so.

1289
01:35:53,248 --> 01:35:56,417
And then l guess
we'll just start driving home.

1290
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:58,043
We'll probably see you Tuesday night.

1291
01:35:58,169 --> 01:36:00,838
Okay. Thanks, David.

1292
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:02,923
Mom and l will head out
early tomorrow morning.

1293
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:04,341
l have to get back, so...

1294
01:36:04,426 --> 01:36:07,052
And l'm gonna have to listen to him harp

1295
01:36:07,137 --> 01:36:10,347
about losing his fortune
for the rest of his life.

1296
01:36:10,432 --> 01:36:12,391
Or my life.

1297
01:36:12,475 --> 01:36:14,810
He's gonna bury me at this rate.

1298
01:36:30,535 --> 01:36:32,369
You big idiot.

1299
01:36:45,717 --> 01:36:47,509
You want this open or closed?

1300
01:36:47,594 --> 01:36:49,344
Might as well close it.

1301
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:14,369
Dad?

1302
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:28,045
Wait, Dad. Dad.
You can't go in like that.

1303
01:39:28,129 --> 01:39:30,297
Come on, you have to get your robe off.

1304
01:39:30,381 --> 01:39:32,132
Here. Come back here.

1305
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:50,108
Hi. Can l help you?

1306
01:39:50,193 --> 01:39:51,318
Hi.

1307
01:39:51,402 --> 01:39:54,154
My father
is here to collect his million dollars.

1308
01:39:55,531 --> 01:39:57,407
Dad, give me the letter.

1309
01:40:17,095 --> 01:40:20,055
l'm sorry, your number wasn't
one of the winning numbers.

1310
01:40:21,974 --> 01:40:23,767
Looks like you didn't win.

1311
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:25,310
But it says l won.

1312
01:40:25,395 --> 01:40:29,523
lt says you won if your number
is one of the winning numbers.

1313
01:40:32,151 --> 01:40:33,777
l'm sorry, sir.

1314
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:36,279
l hope you guys didn't
have to come too far.

1315
01:40:36,364 --> 01:40:37,864
Montana.

1316
01:40:37,949 --> 01:40:39,157
Oh, my.

1317
01:40:40,952 --> 01:40:43,412
Well, Dad, l guess that's it.

1318
01:40:45,748 --> 01:40:46,957
l can give you a free gift,

1319
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:49,626
like a hat or a seat cushion.

1320
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:52,462
You want a hat or a seat cushion?

1321
01:40:54,716 --> 01:40:57,134
Do you want a hat or a seat cushion?

1322
01:40:58,720 --> 01:40:59,803
A hat.

1323
01:41:00,430 --> 01:41:02,139
He'll take the hat.

1324
01:41:26,914 --> 01:41:28,290
Does this happen a lot?

1325
01:41:28,374 --> 01:41:30,751
Yeah. Every once in a while.

1326
01:41:31,586 --> 01:41:33,336
Usually older people like your father.

1327
01:41:34,464 --> 01:41:36,423
Does he have Alzheimer's?

1328
01:41:36,507 --> 01:41:38,925
He just believes stuff
that people tell him.

1329
01:41:39,177 --> 01:41:41,178
That's too bad.

1330
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:42,846
Yeah.

1331
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:45,640
Thank you.

1332
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:00,572
Dad?

1333
01:42:01,574 --> 01:42:02,783
Dad.

1334
01:42:04,577 --> 01:42:06,036
l'm here.

1335
01:42:07,413 --> 01:42:09,247
We're going back to Billings, okay?

1336
01:42:09,332 --> 01:42:10,540
Okay.

1337
01:42:18,925 --> 01:42:22,052
We might make a couple
quick stops first.

1338
01:42:22,637 --> 01:42:24,137
Whatever you want.

1339
01:42:49,622 --> 01:42:53,041
l don't understand
what's happening with your car.

1340
01:42:53,793 --> 01:42:57,587
Well, they made me
a real good offer for it.

1341
01:43:00,299 --> 01:43:02,217
lt's not much of a car.

1342
01:43:02,552 --> 01:43:05,345
Yeah, this truck is a real step up.

1343
01:43:06,013 --> 01:43:09,099
lt's only five years old.
lt's practically brand-new.

1344
01:43:13,145 --> 01:43:15,105
And l hope you don't mind,

1345
01:43:16,482 --> 01:43:18,525
l put your name on the title.

1346
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:26,116
My name is on the title, you say?

1347
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:28,702
Yeah, but you're gonna
have to let me drive it.

1348
01:43:30,788 --> 01:43:33,039
You work out something
with the prize people?

1349
01:43:34,876 --> 01:43:36,293
Yeah.

1350
01:43:36,377 --> 01:43:38,920
They were willing to go
as far as the truck.

1351
01:43:39,005 --> 01:43:40,088
Come on, get in.

1352
01:45:18,729 --> 01:45:21,147
Okay, Dad, it's your turn to drive.

1353
01:45:24,110 --> 01:45:25,944
You said l couldn't.

1354
01:45:26,904 --> 01:45:28,446
Just drive it down Locust Street.

1355
01:45:28,531 --> 01:45:31,032
lt's only a few blocks. There's no traffic.

1356
01:45:33,577 --> 01:45:34,911
Come on.

1357
01:45:35,913 --> 01:45:37,497
lt's your truck.

1358
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:11,007
Hey, there! Looking good, Woody!

1359
01:47:11,092 --> 01:47:12,133
Get down.

1360
01:47:12,218 --> 01:47:14,260
-What?
-God damn it! Get down!

1361
01:47:16,305 --> 01:47:18,056
Looking good!

1362
01:48:41,891 --> 01:48:43,600
So long, Albert.

1363
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:46,394
So long, Woody.
