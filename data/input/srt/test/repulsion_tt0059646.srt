1
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:39,655
- Have you fallen asleep?
- Oh, I'm sorry!

2
00:02:39,656 --> 00:02:45,217
I think you must be
in love or something.

3
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:49,219
Why does the old bitch pick on me?

4
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,420
That's the second time this week.

5
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,702
I nearly told her what she
could do with the job.

6
00:02:53,703 --> 00:02:56,863
- Hey, are you asleep?
- That's what I asked her.

7
00:02:56,864 --> 00:03:02,544
She wants me to stay
until seven again.

8
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,430
What polish are you putting on?

9
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:18,832
- The usual one Madam.
- Oh, I'm fed up with it.

10
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,473
I feel like a change.

11
00:03:21,474 --> 00:03:23,834
Give me Revlon's Fire & Ice.

12
00:03:23,835 --> 00:03:29,156
I'll go and get it.

13
00:03:47,285 --> 00:03:49,885
Madame Denise?

14
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:51,766
Madame Denise,

15
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:54,367
Mrs. Randlesham wants
Revlon's Fire & Ice.

16
00:03:54,368 --> 00:04:00,169
I don't think there's any left.

17
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:10,454
Put this on. She'll never
know the difference.

18
00:04:55,074 --> 00:05:01,435
Hello, darlin'. How
about the other then?

19
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:57,259
You can't eat stuff like this!

20
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:02,221
Come on, I'll take
you to Wheelers. OK?

21
00:06:02,222 --> 00:06:03,902
I have to get back.

22
00:06:03,903 --> 00:06:07,864
Oh, we can have a, we
can have a quick meal.

23
00:06:07,865 --> 00:06:09,105
Come on.

24
00:06:12,627 --> 00:06:13,347
I can't.

25
00:06:14,227 --> 00:06:17,908
- I'll be late.
- Well, just...one thing then?

26
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:18,629
No?

27
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:23,272
I can't.

28
00:06:39,518 --> 00:06:42,678
- Well, goodbye.
- But, just a, just a minute!

29
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:46,120
What about tonight?

30
00:06:46,121 --> 00:06:48,961
I'm sorry, but I'm busy tonight.

31
00:06:48,962 --> 00:06:51,282
You really make me feel wanted.

32
00:06:51,283 --> 00:06:53,603
Who's the lucky boy?

33
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:56,484
I'm having dinner with my sister.

34
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:59,245
She a cook good?

35
00:06:59,246 --> 00:07:02,447
I don't know...I haven't
even thought about it.

36
00:07:02,448 --> 00:07:08,249
Well, at least it can't be
any worse than Fish and chips.

37
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,690
I think we're having rabbit.

38
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:12,851
Rabbit? Oh!

39
00:07:12,852 --> 00:07:15,972
I thought they'd all been killed off.

40
00:07:15,973 --> 00:07:19,374
- No. She has a friend...
- A rabbit?

41
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:22,895
No, I think the friend has rabbits.

42
00:07:22,896 --> 00:07:24,936
Poor bunny.

43
00:07:24,937 --> 00:07:26,657
Well, what about tomorrow?

44
00:07:26,658 --> 00:07:27,937
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

45
00:07:27,938 --> 00:07:30,018
What's doing tomorrow?

46
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:33,300
I'll meet you at the Hoop
and Toy, you know, the pub

47
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:39,181
along there. But ah, seven?

48
00:08:10,437 --> 00:08:12,236
- Hello!
- Hello!

49
00:08:12,237 --> 00:08:18,998
Come along, boy.
Walkies! Walkies!

50
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:53,294
Have a good day?

51
00:08:53,295 --> 00:08:58,616
- Darling?
- Yes.

52
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,241
How's work?

53
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:57,081
All right.

54
00:09:59,043 --> 00:10:00,842
It's close today.

55
00:10:00,843 --> 00:10:02,723
Are you still going away?

56
00:10:02,724 --> 00:10:06,765
Oh Darling, please don't start that again.

57
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:09,606
- How long are you going for?
- I've told you.

58
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:13,368
- Fortnight?
- Mind.

59
00:10:13,369 --> 00:10:14,169
How long?

60
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,570
Ten or twelve days.

61
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:24,011
No more than that?

62
00:10:24,693 --> 00:10:27,013
I heard such a funny story
on the news this evening.

63
00:10:27,014 --> 00:10:30,095
Does he have to leave his
things in the bathroom?

64
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,696
The Minister of Health,
what's his name?

65
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:35,057
He found eels coming out of his sink.

66
00:10:35,058 --> 00:10:38,619
It was on the television.
Even the announcer was laughing.

67
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:43,581
Why does he put his
toothbrush in my glass?

68
00:10:43,582 --> 00:10:49,582
Carol. Please!

69
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,468
We must get this crack mended.

70
00:11:01,469 --> 00:11:02,269
What?

71
00:11:15,235 --> 00:11:16,154
- Hello!
- Hello!

72
00:11:16,155 --> 00:11:18,395
You're early.

73
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:20,116
I didn't expect you for hours!

74
00:11:20,117 --> 00:11:21,636
I couldn't live without
you for another minute.

75
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:22,398
Idiot!

76
00:11:22,998 --> 00:11:26,038
Anyway, you said eight-thirty.
I haven't even started yet.

77
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:28,319
There's a marvelous story
in this evening's paper.

78
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,920
Increase at least one hour.

79
00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:32,802
- Huh?
- Your rabbit. I'm cooking it.

80
00:11:32,803 --> 00:11:36,844
Look: bring to the boil, skim and
allow to simmer slowly for 1-1/2 hours.

81
00:11:38,204 --> 00:11:40,684
Yes, well, we'll go out
tonight, I'll take you out.

82
00:11:40,685 --> 00:11:43,926
Here, read that.

83
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:47,047
Oh, I know that.
I saw it on television.

84
00:11:47,048 --> 00:11:52,409
That bloody bell!

85
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,131
Eels...ha!

86
00:11:54,772 --> 00:11:57,171
Pity it wasn't lobster though.

87
00:11:57,172 --> 00:12:01,013
You never give me a chance to
show you what a good cook I am.

88
00:12:01,014 --> 00:12:03,975
You can tell me over dinner.

89
00:12:03,976 --> 00:12:07,936
You think they'd have something
better to do than clang away
like that all the time.

90
00:12:07,937 --> 00:12:10,857
It's worse when they start
ringing it at midnight.

91
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:12,818
I wonder what they
ring it for, anyway?

92
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:19,221
Perhaps they have wild parties.
Maybe they'll invite me sometime.

93
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:26,184
Go put your best bib and
tuck on, I feel like a spree.

94
00:12:26,185 --> 00:12:29,545
Ah, the beautiful younger sister.

95
00:12:29,546 --> 00:12:34,547
Comment ça va?

96
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:44,111
I thought you were eating in?

97
00:12:44,112 --> 00:12:47,073
Aren't you going to have dinner?

98
00:12:47,074 --> 00:12:47,954
Yes.

99
00:12:48,754 --> 00:12:51,955
I'm going to have dinner.

100
00:12:51,956 --> 00:12:53,476
But not here.

101
00:12:53,477 --> 00:12:59,558
No, not here.

102
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:05,200
Pass me that brush will
you, there's a love.

103
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,243
Just because I go out once,
there's no need to start sulking!

104
00:13:10,244 --> 00:13:12,123
I'm not sulking.

105
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,405
Hmm! Well, you're not exactly smiling.

106
00:13:15,406 --> 00:13:20,807
Come on, you're not going into
the Miss World competition.

107
00:13:20,808 --> 00:13:25,169
- Will we go and see the Leaning Tower of Pisa?
- I don't think Cinderella likes me.

108
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,850
- Cinderella?
- The little sister.

109
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:29,331
Ugh, don't be silly.

110
00:13:29,332 --> 00:13:34,813
- Well, are we going to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa?
- She's a bit strung-up, isn't she?

111
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,735
- She's just sensitive, that's all.
- Huh, you can say that again.

112
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:40,976
She should see a doctor.

113
00:13:40,977 --> 00:13:42,816
- What do you mean?
- Nothing, nothing, nothing.

114
00:13:42,817 --> 00:13:45,297
- No, you just tell me what you meant by that!
- Nothing. Let's forget it.

115
00:13:45,298 --> 00:13:47,778
You want to see the tower of
Pisa? We'll see the bloody thing!

116
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:49,459
Now let's relax,
we're going to dinner!

117
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:55,901
You always change the
subject when you start talking
like that. Do you hear?

118
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:41,601
Come along boy, din-dins.

119
00:14:41,602 --> 00:14:44,643
You like your din-dins.

120
00:14:44,644 --> 00:14:50,004
Come along, boy.

121
00:19:25,202 --> 00:19:30,203
Hu! I'm sorry.

122
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,176
Oh, look, I've got to run.
I've left something at the flat.

123
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:02,458
- What? Aren't you going to drop me off?
- I've got no time.

124
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:07,660
Mmm, that's bloody hot.
You'll have to take a cab.

125
00:20:07,661 --> 00:20:08,981
Ah, here.

126
00:20:12,102 --> 00:20:15,703
- Um, are you...am I going to see you tonight?
- Um...

127
00:20:15,704 --> 00:20:17,624
I-I'll ring you.

128
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:22,745
I-I'll ring you.

129
00:20:40,955 --> 00:20:42,074
Hello darling.

130
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:45,876
- How did you sleep?
- All right.

131
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:51,598
Is he going to stay here every night?

132
00:20:58,522 --> 00:21:03,804
I really don't think that
it's any concern of yours!

133
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:07,525
He's married, though.

134
00:21:07,526 --> 00:21:13,687
Darling! It's my affair!

135
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:23,211
We all have to lead our own
lives in the end, you know.

136
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:26,813
Well just don't stand around like
that, go and answer the phone!

137
00:21:26,814 --> 00:21:31,655
Can't you see I'm busy?

138
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,058
Hello?

139
00:21:35,618 --> 00:21:37,217
- Miss Ledoux?
- Yes.

140
00:21:37,218 --> 00:21:39,658
How longer are you going to
keep me waiting for the rent?

141
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:42,900
Oh, you want my sister!

142
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:45,821
- Ahh...I suppose she's out!
- No, no. She's here.

143
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:49,103
Just a moment.

144
00:21:49,104 --> 00:21:52,344
- Who is it?
- The landlord.

145
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:56,546
Oh, damn it! He would ring up today.

146
00:21:56,547 --> 00:21:58,466
- Hello, yes?
- Miss Ledoux?

147
00:21:58,467 --> 00:22:01,467
- Look, I'm terribly sorry.
- I bet you are!

148
00:22:01,468 --> 00:22:03,388
Look, how longer much longer are
you going to keep me waiting?

149
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:05,709
- I Promise You...
- I've had your promises before.

150
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,470
I-I promise you that you'll
have the money tomorrow.

151
00:22:08,471 --> 00:22:10,992
That's what you said a fortnight ago.

152
00:22:10,993 --> 00:22:13,033
You'll have the money
tomorrow without fail.

153
00:22:13,034 --> 00:22:16,594
- Look, if you're not
going to play fair by me...
- My sister will bring it round to you.

154
00:22:16,595 --> 00:22:17,955
- Won't you?
- N-no,

155
00:22:17,956 --> 00:22:20,156
I'm going away on holiday.

156
00:22:20,157 --> 00:22:22,957
Now look, Miss Ledoux, this time
I've had just about enough...

157
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,318
She'll bring it around to
you tomorrow, I promise!

158
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:30,600
She'd better Miss Ledoux.
That's all I can say!

159
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:32,921
Just the sound of his
voice makes my flesh creep.

160
00:22:32,922 --> 00:22:37,643
Money, money, money, that's
all he every things about!

161
00:22:37,644 --> 00:22:43,565
Good heavens, I
shall be late again.

162
00:23:55,277 --> 00:23:56,717
Is Bridget about?

163
00:23:56,718 --> 00:24:01,918
She's downstairs.

164
00:24:08,883 --> 00:24:09,563
Bridget!

165
00:24:11,364 --> 00:24:13,844
What's the matter?

166
00:24:13,845 --> 00:24:14,645
Nothing.

167
00:24:15,566 --> 00:24:16,166
Tell me.

168
00:24:17,326 --> 00:24:18,047
Nothing.

169
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:24,848
Just bloody men! They promise
you the Earth and then...

170
00:24:24,849 --> 00:24:31,291
- Oh, I could cut my throat!
- Don't say that!

171
00:24:34,093 --> 00:24:36,614
I thought this one was different.

172
00:24:36,615 --> 00:24:41,256
- Was he...?
- Oh, he was a pig. Forget it.

173
00:24:41,257 --> 00:24:42,937
Oh, look at my eyes!

174
00:24:42,938 --> 00:24:47,899
Will Miss Bridget please come to the
salon. Mrs. Prendergast has arrived.

175
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:53,621
I'll tell you the sordid details later.

176
00:24:53,622 --> 00:24:56,742
Oh, why are they so filthy?

177
00:24:56,743 --> 00:24:59,424
Don't be upset.

178
00:24:59,425 --> 00:25:05,825
Will Miss Bridget please come
to the salon right away.

179
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:26,886
Are you joking?

180
00:27:26,887 --> 00:27:28,927
No, you should have seen them.

181
00:27:28,928 --> 00:27:31,048
They went for each other like those
women that addressed us in Hamburg.

182
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:34,088
One a big leg with bloody big charlies
tried to claw the other girl's face.

183
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:36,050
Got her fist right down her throat.
Two pints of bitter, please.

184
00:27:36,051 --> 00:27:38,330
- Two pints, sir?
- Lesbians?

185
00:27:38,331 --> 00:27:41,612
No, no. They both fancied the same
bloke. I should have his luck!

186
00:27:41,613 --> 00:27:45,454
And then they started in with their
teeth, rolling about on the floor,

187
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:48,175
it was like a madhouse.

188
00:27:48,176 --> 00:27:50,456
And I was the only mug who
tried to prevent them. I
ought to have my head examined.

189
00:27:50,457 --> 00:27:52,056
I wouldn't have minded seeing it.

190
00:27:52,057 --> 00:27:53,737
Feel free, anytime.

191
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:54,499
I ended up

192
00:27:55,739 --> 00:27:59,300
with my coat torn, my
shirt covered with blood,

193
00:27:59,301 --> 00:28:01,501
if you like that sort of thing,
I'll introduce you to my cousin.

194
00:28:01,502 --> 00:28:06,621
- She's a black belt.
- Black belt?

195
00:28:06,623 --> 00:28:09,464
How did you get on?

196
00:28:09,465 --> 00:28:11,905
- What?
(What's your cousin like?)

197
00:28:11,906 --> 00:28:14,306
- How did you get on
with little Miss Muffet?
(She sounds fun.)

198
00:28:14,307 --> 00:28:18,027
- When?
- Well I thought you were
taking her out to dinner?

199
00:28:18,028 --> 00:28:20,269
(Y-your cousin, what's she like?)

200
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,109
- Is that the right time?
- No, sir.

201
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:25,430
Oh come on, fill us in
with the gripping details.

202
00:28:25,431 --> 00:28:29,672
The gripping details are that
she had dinner with her sister.

203
00:28:29,673 --> 00:28:35,034
Well maybe you should
try the sister?

204
00:29:02,288 --> 00:29:04,087
Are you playing hard to get?

205
00:29:04,088 --> 00:29:06,648
I've been waiting over an hour.

206
00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:09,489
W-what for?

207
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,050
Well not for Christmas.

208
00:29:11,051 --> 00:29:15,491
We made a date, remember?
We're having supper tonight!

209
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:20,333
I-I forgot.

210
00:29:23,496 --> 00:29:26,496
Well next time  you forget,
maybe you'll let me know.

211
00:29:26,497 --> 00:29:33,139
It's not that, but...

212
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,621
Are you all right?

213
00:29:35,622 --> 00:29:41,022
You look...I don't know...you
look sort of, sort of funny?

214
00:29:41,023 --> 00:29:43,264
I don't feel...

215
00:29:43,265 --> 00:29:44,145
I mean...

216
00:29:44,706 --> 00:29:48,226
I don't know...

217
00:29:48,227 --> 00:29:50,267
Oh well anyway come on. Now
I've found you, let's go and

218
00:29:50,268 --> 00:29:53,227
eat something, I'm starving.

219
00:29:53,228 --> 00:29:57,629
...But, it's too late.

220
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:03,591
Have-have you been
fired or something?

221
00:30:04,954 --> 00:30:11,835
All right, come on.
I'll take you home.

222
00:32:09,246 --> 00:32:12,807
- Listen, Carol, I-I don't understand...
- Idiot!

223
00:32:12,808 --> 00:32:15,968
For heaven's sake!

224
00:32:15,969 --> 00:32:16,450
Carol!

225
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,210
Carol!

226
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:46,662
"Dane doing a little illegal
head outside the ring with a
neat head butt there by Larson

227
00:32:46,663 --> 00:32:49,702
"and over to the corner with Ray
Hunter coming in after Stedman
the Giant,

228
00:32:49,703 --> 00:32:53,864
"and Hunter hitting Stedman all
over the place

229
00:32:53,865 --> 00:32:55,785
"and exchanging places with Larson

230
00:32:55,786 --> 00:32:59,788
"and Larson again for Hunter and
now it's Hunter in against Stedman

231
00:33:01,543 --> 00:33:06,504
"Hunter really throwing Stedman
around I don't know why he goes
out and now it's Larson in again..."

232
00:33:10,873 --> 00:33:11,833
Darling?

233
00:33:12,673 --> 00:33:16,634
What is it?

234
00:33:16,635 --> 00:33:21,756
Don't you feel well?

235
00:33:22,797 --> 00:33:29,559
Oh, I know you don't
want me to go away, but...

236
00:33:36,844 --> 00:33:37,644
Hello?

237
00:33:39,565 --> 00:33:40,405
Hello?

238
00:33:42,206 --> 00:33:43,167
Hello!

239
00:33:45,047 --> 00:33:46,127
Hello!

240
00:36:21,794 --> 00:36:27,315
Why did you throw
Michael's things away?

241
00:36:28,637 --> 00:36:32,637
- Why'd you do it?
- I don't like them there.

242
00:36:32,638 --> 00:36:35,758
It's got absolutely
nothing to do with you!

243
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:40,960
You silly little fool!

244
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:53,565
I've put the money for
the rent on the table.

245
00:36:55,928 --> 00:36:58,968
Oh please, don't go.

246
00:36:58,969 --> 00:37:02,930
Now please, don't forget to
give the money, otherwise we
shall both be out onto the street.

247
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:08,892
- Look, are you coming or aren't you?!
- Yes, yes. I'm coming.

248
00:37:09,814 --> 00:37:17,455
Don't look so sad. The time
will pass very quickly.

249
00:37:18,858 --> 00:37:22,418
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

250
00:37:22,419 --> 00:37:27,179
Heh, heh; come on.

251
00:38:30,888 --> 00:38:36,250
- You're killing me!
- Sorry, Miss Walsh.

252
00:38:36,251 --> 00:38:38,130
- There's only...
- Good morning!

253
00:38:38,131 --> 00:38:39,371
Good morning!

254
00:38:39,372 --> 00:38:41,292
There's only one way
to deal with men,

255
00:38:41,293 --> 00:38:44,053
that's treat them as if you
don't give a damn about them!

256
00:38:44,054 --> 00:38:46,134
I told you all this before.

257
00:38:46,135 --> 00:38:49,215
Still, I'm glad to see that you have
listened to me for just this once.

258
00:38:49,216 --> 00:38:50,656
There's only one thing they want,

259
00:38:50,657 --> 00:38:54,857
and I'll never know why they make
such a fuss about it, but they do.

260
00:38:54,858 --> 00:38:57,539
And the more you make them beg
for it, the happier they are!

261
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:02,341
- He rang me up this morning.
- I said he would!

262
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:03,901
He was practically on his knees.

263
00:39:03,902 --> 00:39:07,303
Well make sure he stays that way.

264
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:08,383
I wonder...

265
00:39:08,384 --> 00:39:12,585
- I don't suppose it would do me
any harm if I had a little snack?
- What do you fancy?

266
00:39:12,586 --> 00:39:13,905
They're all same, just like children.

267
00:39:13,906 --> 00:39:18,187
They want to be spanked
and then given sweets.

268
00:39:18,188 --> 00:39:20,228
Perhaps a...

269
00:39:20,229 --> 00:39:23,429
- ...a little Danish pastry.
- Tsk tsk!

270
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:27,551
- And a cup of chocolate.
- Carol will order it for you.

271
00:39:27,552 --> 00:39:28,233
Carol?

272
00:39:31,754 --> 00:39:37,674
Stop dreaming!

273
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:46,878
You feeling all right, love?

274
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:56,404
Carol, what's the matter?

275
00:39:56,405 --> 00:39:58,644
There's...nothing
you'd like to tell me?

276
00:39:58,645 --> 00:40:01,966
I mean ah...

277
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:06,128
How do you feel now?

278
00:40:06,129 --> 00:40:08,928
Still biting your nails, eh?

279
00:40:08,929 --> 00:40:10,690
I think you'd better go home.

280
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:12,370
Would you like one of
the girls to go with you?

281
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:13,730
No, please.

282
00:40:13,731 --> 00:40:14,971
I'll be all right.

283
00:40:14,972 --> 00:40:16,692
Take a taxi, anyway.

284
00:40:16,693 --> 00:40:22,494
- Uh, ask Millie to give you the money.
- Thank you.

285
00:41:37,887 --> 00:41:38,648
Hello?

286
00:41:51,294 --> 00:41:52,334
Hello?

287
00:41:58,977 --> 00:42:00,097
Hello?

288
00:52:08,555 --> 00:52:10,835
Hello, Carol?

289
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,515
This is Colin.

290
00:52:12,516 --> 00:52:13,077
H-hello?

291
00:52:14,398 --> 00:52:15,557
Carol! Carol,

292
00:52:15,558 --> 00:52:16,478
it's me!

293
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:20,280
Carol!

294
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:25,560
Please answe...!

295
00:53:19,665 --> 00:53:22,545
I'm running a business here
Carol, not a rest home.

296
00:53:22,546 --> 00:53:24,946
You can't just disappear for 3 days.

297
00:53:24,947 --> 00:53:26,307
Are you sure...?

298
00:53:26,308 --> 00:53:29,388
I mean...you're not in any trouble?

299
00:53:29,389 --> 00:53:30,629
No, I'm not.

300
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:32,629
I'm really...

301
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:36,151
But surely you could have phoned?

302
00:53:36,152 --> 00:53:37,512
Well what is it?

303
00:53:37,513 --> 00:53:38,992
Mrs. Shaw Taylor wants to see you.

304
00:53:38,993 --> 00:53:41,553
All right. I'll be with you in a minute.

305
00:53:41,554 --> 00:53:47,156
Carol, I can't help you if you
won't tell me what's the matter.

306
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:48,277
Well...

307
00:53:49,237 --> 00:53:49,838
Hhh!

308
00:53:52,759 --> 00:53:57,081
...well, one of my aunts
came to stay very suddenly...

309
00:53:58,122 --> 00:54:01,922
Oh-h. I was back at work 2 days
after I had my first baby.

310
00:54:01,923 --> 00:54:04,723
If you're going to vanish
every time a relative appears,

311
00:54:04,724 --> 00:54:07,364
we might just as well
put up the shutters!

312
00:54:07,365 --> 00:54:09,445
I'd better go see what
that old bitch wants.

313
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:13,327
Now you get back to your
work; I'll talk to you later.

314
00:54:13,328 --> 00:54:14,728
And Carol...

315
00:54:14,729 --> 00:54:20,729
- do something about your hair.
- Yes, Madam.

316
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:05,590
Out!

317
00:55:17,315 --> 00:55:20,835
I should have your luck
getting off early.

318
00:55:20,836 --> 00:55:26,397
Come on, cheer up!

319
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:32,599
Don't look so miz!

320
00:55:33,281 --> 00:55:36,522
You know, you really
don't look well...

321
00:55:36,523 --> 00:55:38,202
Is it a man?

322
00:55:38,203 --> 00:55:38,884
A man?

323
00:55:38,964 --> 00:55:42,765
Well, I thought maybe that
smooth boy, what's his name,
was making you unhappy.

324
00:55:42,766 --> 00:55:45,646
You know, the one I've seen you with.

325
00:55:45,647 --> 00:55:47,327
Are you in love with him?

326
00:55:47,328 --> 00:55:50,248
I'm not in love...with anyone.

327
00:55:50,249 --> 00:55:53,249
Well, what were you up
to the last three days?

328
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,050
Nothing. I stayed at home.

329
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:58,011
Oh well! That's enough to
drive anyone up the wall!

330
00:55:58,012 --> 00:56:00,692
You ought to go out. Go
to a movies, or something.

331
00:56:00,693 --> 00:56:02,893
- Oh I'd love to!
- Well that's it then!

332
00:56:02,894 --> 00:56:03,535
Do it!

333
00:56:04,014 --> 00:56:07,295
We saw such a funny Chaplin
film at the Classic last night.

334
00:56:07,296 --> 00:56:09,896
What was it called?

335
00:56:09,897 --> 00:56:11,897
I thought I'd die laughing!

336
00:56:11,898 --> 00:56:14,338
He was so hungry he wanted to eat his shoes.

337
00:56:14,339 --> 00:56:15,859
- No!
- Yes!

338
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:21,781
He pretended the laces were spaghetti!

339
00:56:22,022 --> 00:56:25,343
And there was this huge
great big fat man...

340
00:56:25,344 --> 00:56:26,703
...who wanted to eat him!

341
00:56:26,704 --> 00:56:29,345
- What?! Him?
- Yes!

342
00:56:29,346 --> 00:56:33,266
He wanted to eat Charlie Chaplin.

343
00:56:33,267 --> 00:56:36,187
He thought Charlie was a chicken.

344
00:56:36,188 --> 00:56:38,068
- A chicken?
- Yes!

345
00:56:38,069 --> 00:56:40,949
And the chicken walked
like Chaplin, too.

346
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:45,870
You know...

347
00:56:46,713 --> 00:56:49,913
Roger laughed so much I
was quite ashamed of him.

348
00:56:49,914 --> 00:56:55,835
You should see it though to cheer you up.

349
00:58:01,624 --> 00:58:05,105
Still keeping her legs crossed?

350
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:07,345
It's getting you down, you know.

351
00:58:07,346 --> 00:58:08,787
The old, old story...

352
00:58:08,788 --> 00:58:10,748
Not till we're married, darling.

353
00:58:10,749 --> 00:58:13,548
I wouldn't waste your money.

354
00:58:13,549 --> 00:58:15,509
She seems a dead loss to me.

355
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:17,910
I mean, don't let her
being foreign fool you.

356
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,752
They're all the same these bloody
virgins, they just tease us, that's all.

357
00:58:20,753 --> 00:58:23,633
She seems to have old Colin
nicely steamed up, though!

358
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:25,353
She gets a big thrill out of it.

359
00:58:25,354 --> 00:58:27,954
You tell her; she'll soon strip off.

360
00:58:27,955 --> 00:58:29,315
When I want your advice I'll ask for it.

361
00:58:29,316 --> 00:58:33,357
Ah! I do believe the old lad's in love.

362
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:37,678
- What about that, then?
- Another good man gone.

363
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:43,640
I think your friends are
going to have to help you.

364
00:58:44,162 --> 00:58:45,722
Why don't you, um...

365
00:58:45,723 --> 00:58:47,563
take her over to Reggie's pad one evening?

366
00:58:47,564 --> 00:58:49,164
Here, steady on, John!

367
00:58:49,165 --> 00:58:51,205
Oh, Reg'll lay something
on, won't you Reggie?

368
00:58:51,206 --> 00:58:53,166
Or on something.

369
00:58:53,167 --> 00:58:58,407
I can see the scene now.

370
00:58:58,489 --> 00:59:02,049
Sweet music, soft light, a
big jug of ice gin with um...

371
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:03,690
- orange or lemon on top of it.
- Oranges.

372
00:59:03,691 --> 00:59:06,090
Tell her it's a fruit cup, and 3 of
the most eligible bachelors in London.

373
00:59:06,091 --> 00:59:08,772
Here I'm getting excited already!

374
00:59:08,773 --> 00:59:10,453
The end of the evening,
she'll be begging for it.

375
00:59:10,454 --> 00:59:12,214
You'll soon be able to stop twitching.

376
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:16,135
- She'll weep with gratitude.
- Here, maybe we will too.

377
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:17,816
Maybe you want your face pushed in?

378
00:59:17,817 --> 00:59:22,017
- Here, take your hands off me!
- Colin, for heaven's sake!

379
00:59:22,018 --> 00:59:25,099
Relax! Take a joke.
Hit me, or something.

380
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:28,260
Now look boy, you've got it bad!

381
00:59:28,261 --> 00:59:31,422
You see? He's been
in the sun too long!

382
00:59:31,423 --> 00:59:33,142
Look, it was only a joke.

383
00:59:33,143 --> 00:59:36,904
There's no need to bloody
well start going on like
Cassius Clay all over the place!

384
00:59:36,905 --> 00:59:39,024
A joke, boy. Joke!

385
00:59:39,025 --> 00:59:40,466
Fellas-fellas, please!

386
00:59:40,467 --> 00:59:43,824
If you go on like this, you'll
be old before your time.

387
00:59:43,825 --> 00:59:51,148
Look. Relax, take it easy, enjoy life!

388
01:02:50,947 --> 01:02:51,587
Carol?

389
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:54,869
Carol!

390
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:22,360
There's somebody there,
I can see your shadow!

391
01:03:22,361 --> 01:03:28,482
What's the matter? I just want
to talk with you, that's all!

392
01:03:28,483 --> 01:03:29,203
Carol!

393
01:03:32,044 --> 01:03:34,364
If you don't open the door
I'll bloody well break it down!

394
01:03:34,365 --> 01:03:34,926
No!

395
01:03:36,006 --> 01:03:36,566
What?

396
01:03:39,844 --> 01:03:41,363
[Thud]

397
01:04:23,546 --> 01:04:24,306
I'm sorry.

398
01:04:27,188 --> 01:04:28,068
I'm sorry.

399
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:37,630
It's all so sordid.

400
01:04:42,474 --> 01:04:46,795
What's-what's the matter?

401
01:04:46,796 --> 01:04:47,636
I'm sorry.

402
01:04:48,157 --> 01:04:48,877
I just...

403
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:51,797
I had to see you, that's all.

404
01:04:51,798 --> 01:04:58,279
Honestly, it's been so
miserable without you.

405
01:05:00,362 --> 01:05:03,202
I phoned and phoned!

406
01:05:03,203 --> 01:05:09,324
The ringing tone nearly drove me mad.

407
01:05:17,609 --> 01:05:23,571
Is it uh, is it something I've done?

408
01:05:25,213 --> 01:05:26,053
Carol.

409
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:41,979
Please...

410
01:05:45,101 --> 01:05:46,101
Tell me.

411
01:05:59,707 --> 01:06:05,268
I'm not really like this, you know...

412
01:06:05,709 --> 01:06:07,870
Oh...I wish I could find
the proper words to say

413
01:06:07,871 --> 01:06:13,512
they just keep going round
and round in my head...

414
01:06:13,633 --> 01:06:15,354
I just...

415
01:06:18,235 --> 01:06:22,315
I want to be...to be with you

416
01:06:22,316 --> 01:06:27,437
all the time.

417
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:34,529
Na ne na na...
La le la la...

418
01:12:10,584 --> 01:12:13,025
"My darling, wonderful here.
A 1,000 things to tell!

419
01:12:13,026 --> 01:12:15,545
"Did you pay the rent? Love, Helen.

"Michael."

422
01:14:10,395 --> 01:14:10,955
Hello?

423
01:14:16,878 --> 01:14:19,078
You filthy bitch!

424
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:21,439
I-I'm sorry...who is this?

425
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,400
Who is this? Who is this? Who do
you think, you filthy little tart!

426
01:14:24,401 --> 01:14:26,081
You think I don't know he's with you?

427
01:14:26,082 --> 01:14:32,082
You think you're clever, but
you're not that clever, you filthy...

428
01:14:56,784 --> 01:15:01,825
[Flies buzzing]

429
01:15:08,298 --> 01:15:15,257
[Guitar and spoon street music]

430
01:15:44,835 --> 01:15:45,836
Come on!

431
01:15:46,916 --> 01:15:52,117
Open up this door!

432
01:16:00,962 --> 01:16:04,562
Come on, open up. I know you're
in there. There's no use hiding.

433
01:16:04,563 --> 01:16:09,964
I'll call the police.

434
01:17:15,994 --> 01:17:16,594
Well!

435
01:17:18,075 --> 01:17:20,875
Where's Miss Ledoux?

436
01:17:20,876 --> 01:17:22,996
I am Miss Ledoux.

437
01:17:22,997 --> 01:17:26,197
You don't look like her.

438
01:17:26,198 --> 01:17:27,798
I expect you want my sister.

439
01:17:27,799 --> 01:17:28,399
Expect?!

440
01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:34,121
I certainly do!

441
01:17:34,122 --> 01:17:37,282
- Where is she?
- She's not...

442
01:17:37,283 --> 01:17:41,084
- But I can explain...
- Explain!

443
01:17:41,085 --> 01:17:43,644
Ehh. I doubt that, my dear!

444
01:17:43,645 --> 01:17:47,246
I can see it with me own eyes.

445
01:17:47,247 --> 01:17:48,208
Now, then.

446
01:17:49,048 --> 01:17:54,970
What's the idea of barricading
the door against me?

447
01:17:54,971 --> 01:17:57,971
You're not only late with the rent,

448
01:17:57,972 --> 01:18:00,132
but you're damaging the property!

449
01:18:00,133 --> 01:18:05,333
I've got the rent here.

450
01:18:09,617 --> 01:18:15,298
- Let's have a little
light on the subject...
- No!

451
01:18:15,299 --> 01:18:21,020
I'm not a bloody owl, you know.

452
01:18:51,674 --> 01:18:54,635
Ah. I thought I'd seen everything.

453
01:18:54,636 --> 01:19:00,516
This is a flamin' nut house!

454
01:19:11,723 --> 01:19:15,203
Tsu. I duh know...

455
01:19:15,204 --> 01:19:19,566
Uh, do you always, uh,
run around like, uh, this?

456
01:19:20,167 --> 01:19:25,647
I mean to say, it's a bit, uh...

457
01:19:32,892 --> 01:19:35,212
What's the matter?

458
01:19:35,213 --> 01:19:35,933
You ill?

459
01:19:41,176 --> 01:19:44,215
The, uh, heat's
gettin' you down, eh?

460
01:19:44,216 --> 01:19:49,618
Uh, I don't like it myself.

461
01:19:49,619 --> 01:19:54,300
I'll, uh, get you,
uh, a glass of water

462
01:19:54,301 --> 01:19:59,862
You're white as a sheet.

463
01:20:03,825 --> 01:20:08,426
What the hell's this?!

464
01:20:08,427 --> 01:20:14,869
No wonder you look ill if you have
things like this hangin' around.

465
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:20,790
It's the dustbin for you, my lad!

466
01:20:33,237 --> 01:20:34,398
Good Lord!

467
01:20:40,681 --> 01:20:44,041
Beats me how you young people
can live in such a mess.

468
01:20:44,042 --> 01:20:49,243
It's like a pigsty!

469
01:21:08,693 --> 01:21:16,334
Hm. Hi, love. A nice hot cup of
tea might be better perhaps, hm?

470
01:21:17,096 --> 01:21:18,816
Course, uh...

471
01:21:18,817 --> 01:21:24,379
your sister's gone away, hasn't she?

472
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:25,180
Yes, ah.

473
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:31,462
A nice hot cuppa tea and an aspirin
and you'll be as right as rain.

474
01:21:34,703 --> 01:21:39,784
You must be a bit lonely,
I expect, now she's gone.

475
01:21:39,785 --> 01:21:40,346
So I...

476
01:21:40,466 --> 01:21:46,187
I should have guessed it.

477
01:21:46,228 --> 01:21:53,430
All alone, by the telephone.

478
01:21:57,473 --> 01:22:03,195
There's, uh, no need
to be alone, you know.

479
01:22:03,196 --> 01:22:05,396
Poor little girl!

480
01:22:05,397 --> 01:22:09,118
All by herself.

481
01:22:09,119 --> 01:22:15,319
All shaking like a
little frightened animal.

482
01:22:36,370 --> 01:22:38,409
Hm, ah! Your family, um?

483
01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:39,291
Very nice.

484
01:22:44,453 --> 01:22:51,974
There's no need to be
frightened of me, you know?

485
01:22:55,657 --> 01:22:58,338
Is that you?

486
01:22:58,339 --> 01:22:59,580
Ah hah!

487
01:23:03,501 --> 01:23:07,022
Where was it taken? In London?

488
01:23:07,023 --> 01:23:07,623
Brussels.

489
01:23:11,265 --> 01:23:16,305
Ah, Brussels, hm?

490
01:23:31,073 --> 01:23:38,354
I...could be a very good
friend to you, you know.

491
01:23:39,036 --> 01:23:39,917
You...

492
01:23:40,797 --> 01:23:42,997
look after me...

493
01:23:42,998 --> 01:23:49,560
and you can...forget about the rent.

494
01:23:49,561 --> 01:23:51,520
Come on. Come on.

495
01:23:51,521 --> 01:23:58,283
Just a little kiss
between friends, come on.

496
01:31:36,038 --> 01:31:41,679
You go on up, I'll park the car.

497
01:32:22,098 --> 01:32:22,858
Carol?

498
01:32:29,741 --> 01:32:35,742
Carol? Are you in?

499
01:32:47,508 --> 01:32:48,549
Carol?!

500
01:33:17,001 --> 01:33:20,281
I say, what's the matter?

501
01:33:20,282 --> 01:33:23,043
What a terrible smell!

502
01:33:23,044 --> 01:33:24,884
What the hell's going on?

503
01:33:24,885 --> 01:33:28,605
Get a grip of yourself, will you!

504
01:33:28,606 --> 01:33:33,287
Now what's the matter?

505
01:33:34,048 --> 01:33:34,849
Oh, d...

506
01:34:34,994 --> 01:34:38,114
Go in there.

507
01:34:38,115 --> 01:34:43,156
Just sit, sit there.

508
01:34:57,204 --> 01:34:58,924
- Have you got a phone?
- Who are you?

509
01:34:58,925 --> 01:35:00,244
I need to phone.

510
01:35:00,245 --> 01:35:02,405
- I to phone!
- Want a telephone?

511
01:35:02,406 --> 01:35:05,566
Yes, a telephone!

512
01:35:05,567 --> 01:35:10,207
"FIRE EXIT"

513
01:35:40,222 --> 01:35:41,822
Everything'll be all right.

514
01:35:41,823 --> 01:35:45,543
He's gone to the porter's room
to make a telephone call.

515
01:35:45,544 --> 01:35:47,784
She doesn't speak English, does she?

516
01:35:47,785 --> 01:35:53,346
Yes, I think she does.

517
01:36:08,634 --> 01:36:14,395
- What's happened?
- I don't know, we just came in here.

518
01:36:42,048 --> 01:36:44,928
No, you'd better not touch her.
They've sent...I wanted to get
to like her honey...[muttering]

519
01:36:44,929 --> 01:36:47,450
Don't touch her.

520
01:36:47,451 --> 01:36:49,530
I'll get us some brandy.

521
01:36:49,531 --> 01:36:51,291
Has anyone called for an ambulance?

522
01:36:51,292 --> 01:36:53,371
Yes, he's gone to telephone now.

523
01:36:53,372 --> 01:36:53,893
Who?

524
01:36:54,413 --> 01:36:57,093
The man we saw on the stairs.

525
01:36:57,094 --> 01:36:59,134
Can anyone do artificial respiration?

526
01:36:59,135 --> 01:37:02,136
You shouldn't touch her,
you shouldn't move her.

527
01:37:02,137 --> 01:37:04,457
I'll get us some brandy.

528
01:37:04,458 --> 01:37:06,498
- Somebody must help her.
- Don't go in the bathroom.

529
01:37:06,499 --> 01:37:11,699
- Why?
- Please, someone help her.

530
01:37:30,869 --> 01:37:34,705
I wouldn't touch her.
Don't touch her!

531
01:37:34,706 --> 01:37:40,147
What's he doing?

532
01:37:41,833 --> 01:37:45,394
- He's got no right...
- Please!

533
01:37:45,395 --> 01:37:51,076
- You shouldn't touch her.
- He shouldn't touch her.
