1
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,916
In the year of our Lord...

2
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:03,046
...Judea, for nearly a century,
had lain under the mastery of Rome.

3
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,924
In the seventh year of the reign
of Augustus Caesar...

4
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,593
...an imperial decree
ordered every Judean...

5
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,263
...each to return
to his place of birth...

6
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,807
...to be counted and taxed.

7
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,687
The converging ways of many of them led
to their capital city, Jerusalem...

8
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,940
...the troubled heart of their land.

9
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,694
The old city was dominated
by the fortress of Antonia...

10
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,279
...the seat of Roman power...

11
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,614
...and by the great golden temple...

12
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:34,077
...the outward sign of
an inward and imperishable faith.

13
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,998
Even while they obeyed
the will of Caesar...

14
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:41,376
...the people clung proudly
to their ancient heritage...

15
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,588
...always remembering
the promise of their prophets...

16
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,091
...that one day there would be
born among them a redeemer...

17
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:52,637
...to bring them salvation
and perfect freedom.

18
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,690
You'll be counted at Hebron.

19
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:04,900
- Name?
- Samuel.

20
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,193
- What city?
- Joppa.

21
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,819
- What family?
- Michael.

22
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,155
- Move on. Move on.
- Yes.

23
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,781
- Name?
- Joseph.

24
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,159
- What city?
- Nazareth.

25
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,119
- What family?
- David of Bethlehem.

26
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,872
- And the woman?
- My wife.

27
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,541
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.

28
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,211
Come on, come on.

29
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,843
What village is this?

30
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,261
Nazareth.

31
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,514
We should arrive in Jerusalem
tomorrow night.

32
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,578
You're not watching
the soldiers, Joseph?

33
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,997
We've seen Romans before.

34
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,332
Yes...

35
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,501
...and we will see them again.

36
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,591
My table is not finished.

37
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,343
Where is your son?

38
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:32,847
He's walking in the hills.

39
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,808
He neglects his work, Joseph.

40
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,352
No.

41
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:42,106
Once, I reproached him with
forgetting his work. He said to me:

42
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,984
"I must be about my father's business."

43
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,737
Then why isn't he here, working?

44
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,407
He's working.

45
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,623
Trumpeters of the legion!

46
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,396
Welcome, Messala.

47
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,273
The command is yours.

48
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,899
Thank you.

49
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,570
Thank you for relieving me.

50
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,330
Drusus...

51
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:27,670
...when I was a boy, I dreamed
of commanding this garrison.

52
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,467
Now the wheel has turned.

53
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,470
I am in command.

54
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,980
Attention!

55
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,735
Aisle one, face right!

56
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,654
Forward!

57
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,164
I'd forgotten the heat.

58
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,500
If it were only the heat.

59
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:09,253
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.

60
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,964
- My father was head of...
- Yes, I know.

61
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:16,219
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.

62
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,514
If there can be such a thing
in this forsaken land.

63
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,769
If you want to rise, Sextus,
do the difficult.

64
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,815
I asked to be sent here.

65
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:32,193
I think you'll find the people changed
since you were a boy.

66
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,028
In what way?

67
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:38,449
Oh, won't pay their taxes,
an irrational resentment of Rome...

68
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,036
There's nothing new in all that.

69
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:46,165
And then there's religion. I tell
you, they're drunk with religion.

70
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:50,253
They smash the statues of our gods,
even those of the emperor.

71
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,713
Punish them.

72
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,926
We do.

73
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,762
When we can find them.

74
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,223
Find the leaders.

75
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,768
Oh, you don't know. There's nothing
you can put your finger on.

76
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,396
I tell you, there are strange forces
at work here.

77
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,064
For instance,
this "messiah" business...

78
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,984
I know. There was one
predicted when I was a boy.

79
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:17,738
A king of the Jews, who will lead them
into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.

80
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,866
Makes your head spin.

81
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,869
There's a wild man
in the desert named John...

82
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,079
...who drowns people in water.

83
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:29,375
And a carpenter's son who does magic
tricks. "Miracles" they call them.

84
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,919
There's always a rabble-rouser
stirring up trouble.

85
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,297
No, no, no. This man is different.

86
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,092
He teaches that God is near,
in every man.

87
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,306
It's actually quite profound,
some of it.

88
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,268
You've been too long away from Rome.

89
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,936
Go back, Sextus.

90
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,606
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea...

91
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,942
...and forget that
God is in every man.

92
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:59,155
- There is divinity in only one man.
- Yes, I know.

93
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,908
The emperor is displeased.

94
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:06,120
He wishes Judea made into a more
obedient and disciplined province.

95
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,540
He has ordered me to restore order.
I intend to carry out his wishes.

96
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,295
But how? You can break a man's skull,
arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.

97
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,673
But how do you control what's up here?
How do you fight an idea?

98
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,759
Especially a new idea.

99
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,433
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.

100
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,810
I assume he has a name.

101
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:34,482
- He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
- Then treat him like one!

102
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,153
Tell him I will join him.

103
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,656
Yes, tribune.

104
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,991
Centurion!

105
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,833
This was his country
before it was ours.

106
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,460
Don't forget that.

107
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,797
Yes, tribune.

108
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:06,681
Very wise. This Ben-Hur is
the richest man in Jerusalem.

109
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,850
And the head of one
of the greatest families in Judea.

110
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,019
We were friends as boys.

111
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,730
We were like brothers.

112
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,484
Sextus...

113
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,196
...you ask how to fight an idea.

114
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,198
Well, I'll tell you how.

115
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,702
With another idea.

116
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,367
I said I'd come back.

117
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,746
I never thought you would.

118
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,249
I'm so glad.

119
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,301
- Look at you.
- Look at you!

120
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,096
You've come back a tribune.

121
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,974
When I heard that news,
I drank a toast to you.

122
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,020
We'll drink another now.

123
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,773
- Your sister and mother?
- They're fine.

124
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,901
They've talked of you
ever since we knew you were coming.

125
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,444
- Is Tirzah married?
- No.

126
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,447
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.

127
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,116
She's been in love with you
since she was 5.

128
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,452
I can't wait to see them.

129
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,205
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?

130
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,040
Or have you become too dignified?

131
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:19,271
- Down Eros, up Mars!
- Down Eros, up Mars!

132
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,281
Where the beams cross?

133
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,131
Good.

134
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,025
After all these years!

135
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,987
Still close.

136
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,864
In every way.

137
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,201
I hope so.

138
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,538
I know.

139
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,376
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew...

140
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,337
...whose life you once saved.

141
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,091
The best thing I ever did.

142
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,055
Judah...

143
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,727
...it will be very difficult
to govern here.

144
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,562
I'm going to need help.

145
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,690
Your help. Your advice.

146
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,198
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.

147
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,826
Withdraw your legions.

148
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,747
Give us our freedom.

149
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,545
Unfortunately, the emperor
is devoted to his empire.

150
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,048
He's particularly fond of Judea.

151
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,092
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.

152
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,554
Is there anything so sad
as unrequited love?

153
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,103
My quarters.

154
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,439
A bit grim.

155
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,107
Not grim.

156
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,902
Austere. Virtuous.

157
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,612
Roman.

158
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:40,454
I'm going to be second-in-command
to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.

159
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,998
He's arriving in a few days
with two more legions.

160
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,253
Then the rumors are true.

161
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,467
The emperor does not approve
of your countrymen.

162
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:57,638
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.

163
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,187
But you and your family
need have no concern.

164
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,190
I'm next in authority to the governor,
and you're my friend.

165
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:11,443
- I'm a Jew.
- Ah, you are like a Roman!

166
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,946
What have you in common
with the troublemaking rabble?

167
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,991
Rabble? They're my people.
I'm one of them.

168
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,701
Be wise, Judah.

169
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:22,997
It's a Roman world. If you want to
live in it, you must become part of it.

170
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,040
You've changed.

171
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,794
I've grown up. I've seen the world
since I left Jerusalem.

172
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:32,715
I've seen Rome. It's no accident
that one small village on the Tiber...

173
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,675
...was chosen to rule the world.

174
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,552
Your legions.

175
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,639
It wasn't just our legions.

176
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:45,352
Other countries have armies,
fine armies. I know, I fought them.

177
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,645
Oh, no.

178
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:52,026
No, it was fate that chose us
to civilize the world. And we have.

179
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:55,237
Our roads and ships connect
every corner of the earth.

180
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,949
Roman law, architecture, literature
are the glory of the human race.

181
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,535
I believe in the future of my people.

182
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:05,456
Of course you do.
And you can help them.

183
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,375
How?

184
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,502
You're an aristocrat.

185
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:14,048
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince among your people.

186
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,884
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.

187
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,595
They'd listen if you
spoke out against rebellion.

188
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:23,182
Persuade your people that
their resistance to Rome is stupid.

189
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,726
It is worse than stupid, futile!

190
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:29,480
For it can end in only one way,
extinction for your people!

191
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:37,988
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.

192
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,783
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.

193
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,409
Then we're agreed!

194
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,580
Now, when can I come
to see your family?

195
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:51,377
- We had hoped tomorrow.
- Good.

196
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,297
And now for our toast.

197
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,427
It's dreadful wine, by the way.

198
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,555
It's especially fermented
for the Roman army.

199
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,267
You're very cruel to your conquerors.

200
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,274
It's an insane world.

201
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,278
But in it there is one sanity:

202
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,407
The loyalty of old friends.

203
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,078
Judah, we must believe in one another.

204
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,539
Will you drink to that?

205
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,461
With all my heart.

206
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,984
Here it is, the place I've remembered.

207
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,987
The court where we played
at changing the guard.

208
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:04,366
The roof where we'd throw pebbles
at people in the street and then hide.

209
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:07,995
- We were rascals, weren't we?
- No, you were good boys.

210
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:10,289
I would have that time again.

211
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,958
And here it is. Nothing has changed.

212
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,626
Except for the fountain.

213
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:19,006
- The old well would go dry, remember?
- Promptly, every summer.

214
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:23,969
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.

215
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,723
- He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
- No?

216
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:32,519
Of course he has. He was a boy
when he left us, now he's a man.

217
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,022
With great responsibilities.

218
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,399
Come.

219
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,904
The emperor builds and builds,
turning brick to marble.

220
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:45,115
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.

221
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:53,248
I've never seen anything
like this before. It's beautiful!

222
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,502
- Is it Roman?
- It's Libyan. I was there last year.

223
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,212
A tremendous campaign.

224
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:01,882
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.

225
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:05,344
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.

226
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,387
Or was, till we destroyed it.

227
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,433
Now it's nothing but ashes.

228
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,021
I'm boring you with soldier stories.

229
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:20,150
Come with me, there's something
I want to show you.

230
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,277
Thank you for this.

231
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:26,448
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.

232
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,715
What do you think of it?

233
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,802
Magnificent.

234
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,307
It's Arabic.

235
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,936
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.

236
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,813
Let me try him sometime.

237
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,566
Whenever you like. He's yours.

238
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,612
Do you mean you'll give me this?

239
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,948
Oh, Judah.

240
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:13,787
You are good. It's going
to be like old times, I know it.

241
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,796
Judah, tell me, did you...

242
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,965
...think about what I said?

243
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,843
Yes. Talked to a number
of people already.

244
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,804
Spoken against violence,
against incidents.

245
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,848
Most of the men agree with me.

246
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,100
Most? Not all?

247
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,645
- No, not all.
- Who does not agree?

248
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,816
Well, the resentful, the impatient.

249
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,026
Who are they?

250
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:50,282
Yes, Judah. Who are they?

251
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:00,167
Would I retain your friendship
if I became an informer?

252
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,544
Telling the names of criminals
is not informing.

253
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:05,631
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.

254
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,341
Patriots?!

255
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,556
Judah.

256
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:19,144
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.

257
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:24,524
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.

258
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,694
This is my great opportunity,
and yours too.

259
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,364
If I bring order here,
I can have any post I want.

260
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,867
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?

261
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:37,079
Rome! Yes, perhaps at the side
of Caesar himself.

262
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,040
I mean it. It can happen
and this is the moment.

263
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,000
I swear, this is the time.

264
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,046
The emperor is watching us, judging
us. All I need do is serve him.

265
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,716
And all you need do
is help me serve him.

266
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:55,555
- You speak as if he were God.
- He is God. The only God.

267
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:59,810
He is power,
real power on earth, not...

268
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,896
Not that.

269
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,733
Help me, Judah.

270
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,905
I would do anything
for you, Messala...

271
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,409
...except betray my own people.

272
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:20,247
In the name of all the gods, what do
the lives of a few Jews mean to you?

273
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:27,921
If I cannot persuade them, that does
not mean I would help you murder them.

274
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:33,635
Besides, you must
understand this, Messala.

275
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,596
I believe in the past
and future of my people.

276
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,433
Future? You are a conquered people.

277
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:45,230
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.

278
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,607
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.

279
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:52,070
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.

280
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,614
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?

281
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:57,784
Joshua will not rise again
to save you nor David.

282
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:01,955
There is only one reality in
the world today. Look to the West.

283
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,582
Don't be a fool! Look to Rome!

284
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,792
Better a fool
than a traitor or a killer.

285
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,795
- I am a soldier.
- Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.

286
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,965
- I warn you...
- No! I warn you.

287
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,967
Rome is an affront to God.

288
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:17,512
Rome is strangling my people
and my country, the whole earth!

289
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,181
But not forever.

290
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:23,143
And I tell you, the day Rome falls
there will be a shout of freedom...

291
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,146
...such as the world
has never heard before.

292
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,945
Judah.

293
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:39,117
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.

294
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,454
You're either for me or against me.

295
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:50,170
If that is the choice...

296
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,507
...then I am against you.

297
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,577
There they are.

298
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,747
Where's Messala?

299
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,376
- Where's?
- He's gone.

300
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,378
Gone?

301
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,381
- But why?
- He couldn't stay.

302
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:38,051
- What happened?
- A new tribune must have many duties.

303
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:41,054
Come. Let us have dinner.

304
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:58,238
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God,
King of the world...

305
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,907
...who bringeth to us
bread from the earth.

306
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,916
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.

307
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,631
He wanted to use me
to betray our people.

308
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,761
Judah.

309
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,601
- Master, the caravan from Antioch.
- Yes, Amrah, I saw.

310
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,312
Simonides.

311
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,024
- Welcome.
- Judah.

312
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,777
- Oh, welcome homecoming.
- Master.

313
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,571
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.

314
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,616
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.

315
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,660
And for the master, lberian wine.

316
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,829
Not to mention the best gift of all,
your presence.

317
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:33,833
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.

318
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:36,628
- Caravans from Petra.
- Have all arrived.

319
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,630
- Good.
- Here is the accounting.

320
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,173
And what of Numidia?

321
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:44,010
The trade route is ours,
guaranteed by treaty with the king.

322
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,846
Once a year,
you bring your accounting.

323
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,849
And once a year,
I find myself wealthier.

324
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,978
Yeah, but my greatest treasure
is my steward.

325
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,814
My life belongs to the House of Hur.

326
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:59,359
Nothing else exists for me,
except my daughter.

327
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:03,363
- She must be a young woman by now.
- Yes, and your property.

328
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,532
She was born
the daughter of your slave.

329
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:09,369
When I inherited you,
I inherited a friend, not a slave.

330
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:13,248
Still, Esther has come with me from
Antioch for your permission to marry.

331
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:17,210
It's granted. I wish you
the joy of many grandchildren.

332
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,839
If it is the Lord's will, I shall rejoice.

333
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:58,376
With your permission,
Esther wishes to speak to her master.

334
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,605
You're eager to marry, Esther?

335
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,901
It is my father's wish.

336
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,114
Your husband will be fortunate.

337
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,284
What is his name?

338
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,287
David, son of Mathias.

339
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,122
Of what house?

340
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:39,501
- His own, master.
- He is a freeman.

341
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,587
Tell me more about him.

342
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,299
I have seen him only once.

343
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,635
He is a merchant,
well-thought-of in Antioch.

344
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,346
He will pay for Esther's freedom.

345
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,475
Her freedom will be
my wedding gift to Esther.

346
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,606
You are generous, master.

347
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,823
Do you love this man?

348
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,496
I will learn to love him.

349
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,724
You have my permission to marry.

350
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,978
We'll drink to your happiness.

351
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,440
And a safe return to Antioch.

352
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,091
I disturbed you.

353
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,885
No.

354
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,137
What were you thinking?

355
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:17,474
I was saying goodbye...

356
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,767
...to this city...

357
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,395
...and this house.

358
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:30,695
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?

359
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,532
My father sometimes brought me here...

360
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,409
...when I was little.

361
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:41,581
It was a house
where I was always happy.

362
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,044
Except once.

363
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:50,340
When you and your friend,
the Roman boy...

364
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,634
- Messala.
- Yes.

365
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,553
You had been out hunting...

366
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,474
...and they brought you home injured.

367
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,937
I touched your face
as you lay there...

368
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:12,362
...and prayed to God,
"Don't let this boy die."

369
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:20,495
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.

370
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,581
Yes, master.

371
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:27,252
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.

372
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:33,258
It's strange. I hardly felt a slave.

373
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,098
And now...

374
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,476
...I hardly feel free.

375
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:49,566
You know, in the old, wise days
of Solomon...

376
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,901
...if there was among his slaves...

377
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,904
...some girl who filled his eyes...

378
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,241
...he could choose her out
from the rest...

379
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,994
...and take her to him.

380
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,122
Wise days of Solomon.

381
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,292
Different days.

382
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:11,838
And long ago.

383
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,391
If you were not a bride...

384
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,686
...I should kiss you goodbye.

385
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,524
If I were not a bride...

386
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,652
...there would be no goodbyes
to be said.

387
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,792
Your slave ring.

388
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,048
Fair exchange.

389
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:59,927
Freedom to you. The ring to me.

390
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,055
You will wear it?

391
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,273
Until you meet the woman
you will marry?

392
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:21,115
Until then.

393
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,587
The gods favor my lord Gratus.

394
00:45:57,796 --> 00:46:01,048
If it is the governor's pleasure,
the wreath of office.

395
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,967
Thank you, tribune.

396
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,513
I see no delegation from the city.

397
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,891
- There will not be one, sir.
- No?

398
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,477
Jerusalem's welcome will not
be a warm one.

399
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:15,480
But I pledge, my lord,
it will be a quiet one.

400
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,690
Let us proceed.

401
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,171
There's Messala.

402
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,184
He saw you, Judah.

403
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,299
The new governor.

404
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,649
Stand back!

405
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,154
- Stand back.
- Up there. You, come!

406
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,323
Had to be the Jews!

407
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:39,457
Open up in the name
of the divine emperor!

408
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:53,721
Judah! Tirzah! What is it?
What's happened?

409
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,848
Open up in the name of Rome!

410
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:59,143
- I was watching the Romans...
- A tile fell and struck the governor.

411
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,520
- It wasn't my fault.
- They won't believe her.

412
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:05,358
She won't have to say anything.
You hear? Tirzah, say nothing.

413
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:07,652
Open the gates!

414
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,368
I'll speak to them.

415
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,496
- Arrest him!
- Wait. Let me tell you what happened.

416
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,998
Hold those women.
Not them!

417
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,292
- Judah!
- It was an accident.

418
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:28,965
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.

419
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:32,718
- This is the man, sir. We saw him.
- It was an accident.

420
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,304
- Accident?
- I swear it.

421
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,808
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose. It gave way.

422
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,893
Take him. Take all of them.

423
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:44,313
He's telling the truth!
- It was me! Let them go!

424
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,523
Judah!

425
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,692
Attention!

426
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,823
Messala.

427
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,001
In the name of God,
tell them it's a mistake.

428
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,295
I leaned on the tile,
and it broke loose.

429
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,176
It was an accident.

430
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:26,689
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!

431
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,233
Messala!
Messala.

432
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:33,821
Let the servants go.

433
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,699
Let them go. Return to your ranks.

434
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,666
- Come.
- Where?

435
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,584
Tirus.

436
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,879
Tirus?

437
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,675
I've had no trial.

438
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:21,220
I'm to die in the galleys
without even a trial?

439
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:24,140
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!

440
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:27,643
Wait. My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?

441
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,353
Tie his hands.

442
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:35,568
- At least tell me if they're safe.
- I can tell you nothing.

443
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:07,892
Get along. Keep moving.

444
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,366
Jailer!

445
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:28,037
Guard, in there!

446
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,414
Up the stairs!

447
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:34,919
Jailer!

448
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,380
To the right.

449
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,937
Wait!
Send them out.

450
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,524
Send them out.

451
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,652
You can go.

452
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,572
Go!

453
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:51,578
The door.

454
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,506
Where are my mother and sister?

455
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:15,394
Where are they?

456
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:20,816
Here, within these walls.

457
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,570
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.

458
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,866
Of course, they will be sentenced.

459
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:36,123
Is it possible, Messala?

460
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,461
Is it possible
you could do this to us?

461
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:43,422
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?

462
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:46,258
You'll let them go.

463
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,927
You must.
You will gladly let them go!

464
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,846
Messala!

465
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:56,685
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not mad. I'm not a murderer!

466
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,562
I know you're not.

467
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,815
You know?

468
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,071
You are evil.

469
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:10,032
No, Judah, I am not evil.

470
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,493
I wanted your help.

471
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:15,162
Now you've given it to me.

472
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:19,291
By making this example of you,
I discourage treason.

473
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:23,504
By condemning without hesitation
an old friend, I shall be feared.

474
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,300
But not my family.

475
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,428
Let them go.

476
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:33,055
Please.

477
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,976
- Messala, I beg you.
- Beg?!

478
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,232
Didn't I beg you?

479
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:51,407
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.

480
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,535
Kill me, and your mother
and sister will die today...

481
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,079
...nailed to crosses in front of you!

482
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,833
Go on, Judah.

483
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,168
Kill me!

484
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,392
May God grant me vengeance.

485
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:22,438
I will pray that
you live till I return.

486
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,481
Return?

487
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,155
Take him.

488
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:10,444
Sentries, salute.

489
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,113
The tribune will see you now.

490
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:48,190
Tribune, I'm steward
of the House of Hur.

491
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:50,984
I remember you.

492
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:55,072
We were on our way to Antioch
when we heard what had happened.

493
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:59,076
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done
this thing. You knew him, tribune.

494
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:00,869
Better than you.

495
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:05,582
Then there must be no doubt in
your mind, the charge is groundless.

496
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,043
The prisoners have been sentenced.

497
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,504
- Sentenced?
- But there's no truth in it.

498
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:14,216
There was never a threat against
the governor in Judah's mind.

499
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:17,219
Surely you must know
he would never have done this.

500
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,721
In your heart, you must know it.

501
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:26,228
Drusus.

502
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:34,528
This man had better be kept here
until we have time to question him.

503
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:31,376
Hold!

504
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,226
Water for the soldiers.

505
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:31,353
Soldiers first!

506
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,858
Get away from that well!
No water for them!

507
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,945
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!

508
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:43,031
Come on, you! Water for the horses!

509
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,913
Water. Water.
Soldiers first!

510
01:01:58,756 --> 01:01:59,881
Here.

511
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:23,947
Wait.

512
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,658
No water for him.

513
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,056
God...

514
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:52,768
...help me.

515
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:49,533
You! I said no water for him!

516
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:25,986
All right, on your feet, all of you!

517
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:27,612
Get them on their feet!

518
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:30,866
Back in line, you dog!

519
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:45,338
On your feet!

520
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,173
Get them going!

521
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:53,722
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!

522
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:58,810
Forward, you dogs!

523
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,503
In a few minutes, the consul's barge
will be coming alongside.

524
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:08,588
Be ready to raise oars.

525
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,681
Raise oars!

526
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,310
Down oars!

527
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:42,497
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.

528
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:05,770
- How many rowers?
- Two hundred, consul.

529
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:08,815
- And reliefs?
- Of 30, every hour.

530
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:46,895
This man is ill. Replace him.

531
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:49,272
- Change him.
- Right, sir.

532
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:58,865
- This man has been giving you trouble?
- He's insubordinate, consul.

533
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,117
That will stop.

534
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:27,310
What service have you seen?

535
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:30,688
Forty-one.

536
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:34,901
A month's less a day in this ship.

537
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:39,322
You keep an exact account.
And before?

538
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:43,034
Three years in other ships.

539
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:46,412
Three years.

540
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,145
You have the spirit to fight back...

541
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:13,064
...but the good sense to control it.

542
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:20,321
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.

543
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:24,909
That's good. Hate keeps a man alive.

544
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:27,078
It gives him strength.

545
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:30,832
Now, listen to me, all of you.

546
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:38,006
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.

547
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,427
So row well...

548
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:44,929
...and live.

549
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,191
- Ship ready, consul.
- Strike oars.

550
01:09:56,442 --> 01:10:00,069
Strike oars!

551
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:22,800
You know that a fleet
of Macedonian galleys...

552
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:25,803
...has been raiding Roman commerce.

553
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:29,307
The emperor has honored us
with the task...

554
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:32,185
...of seeking out and destroying them.

555
01:11:04,009 --> 01:11:05,843
Battle speed, hortator.

556
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,431
Battle speed!

557
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:42,213
Attack speed.

558
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,507
Attack speed!

559
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:26,090
Ramming speed.

560
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:28,926
Ramming speed!

561
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:44,127
Rest.

562
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,504
Halt!

563
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:48,923
Rest!

564
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:53,237
Why are you here?

565
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:56,949
I was ordered to report to you
during my relief.

566
01:14:59,077 --> 01:15:00,745
Oh, yes.

567
01:15:01,246 --> 01:15:02,914
I'd forgotten.

568
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:11,380
You could have killed me
as I lay there.

569
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:13,758
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?

570
01:15:14,384 --> 01:15:16,385
I'm not ready to die.

571
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:18,721
What do you think will save you?

572
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:21,557
The God of my fathers.

573
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:25,102
Hmm. Your God has forsaken you.

574
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:28,523
He has no more power
than the images I pray to.

575
01:15:28,732 --> 01:15:32,568
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.

576
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:34,237
I might.

577
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:37,615
Does that interest you, 41?

578
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:41,786
I can see that it does.

579
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,249
I'm a fighting man by profession,
and in my leisure moments...

580
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:49,252
...it amuses me to train fighting men.

581
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:52,588
I own some of the best gladiators
and charioteers in Rome.

582
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:55,007
Would you like to become one of them?

583
01:15:55,425 --> 01:15:57,385
To die as your slave?

584
01:15:57,803 --> 01:16:00,137
Better than to live in chains
below these decks.

585
01:16:00,764 --> 01:16:02,807
I will not be here forever.

586
01:16:04,184 --> 01:16:05,226
No?

587
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:12,149
What would you do if you escaped?

588
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:17,446
Two people were condemned with me,
my mother and sister...

589
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:19,907
...though they were innocent.
I won't rest...

590
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:21,951
Do not say that you were innocent.

591
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:25,454
- Would it do any good to say it again?
- No.

592
01:16:26,164 --> 01:16:30,793
Consider my offer carefully. You will
never escape while we are victorious.

593
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:35,172
If we are not, you will sink
with this ship, chained to your oar.

594
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:38,342
I cannot believe that
God has let me live these three years...

595
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,344
...to die chained to an oar.

596
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:44,181
It's a strange, stubborn faith
you keep...

597
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:47,268
...to believe that
existence has a purpose.

598
01:16:47,477 --> 01:16:51,689
A sane man would have learned
to lose it long before this.

599
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:53,357
As you have.

600
01:16:54,192 --> 01:16:56,193
What drove it out of you?

601
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:00,364
Go back to your oar, 41.

602
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:18,966
Consul, enemy sighted.

603
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:22,511
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.

604
01:17:29,394 --> 01:17:32,188
All the watch to battle posts.

605
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:39,278
Stand by to load.
Make ready to fire.

606
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:40,905
Hurry, quick!

607
01:17:43,408 --> 01:17:46,202
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.

608
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:53,918
Raise oars!

609
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:57,505
Down oars!

610
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:59,674
Chain rowers!

611
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,072
Guard.

612
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:27,243
Unlock 41.

613
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,912
No! I don't want to die!

614
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:31,914
I don't want to die!

615
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:05,573
41, why did he do that?

616
01:19:06,324 --> 01:19:07,783
I don't know.

617
01:19:10,495 --> 01:19:13,497
Once before, a man helped me.

618
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:16,500
I didn't know why then.

619
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:21,255
Normal speed!

620
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:59,627
Number 1, flame.

621
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:02,838
- Fire.
Fire!

622
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:15,518
Fire!

623
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:17,228
Fire!

624
01:20:23,026 --> 01:20:24,902
Hold withdrawal on command.

625
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:29,198
Lift oars! Raise!

626
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:31,408
Withdraw!

627
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:35,079
Steersman, right.

628
01:20:42,879 --> 01:20:44,588
Extend oars!

629
01:20:46,299 --> 01:20:48,259
Fire!
Fire!

630
01:20:54,558 --> 01:20:55,891
Fire!

631
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,573
Watch out!
Fire!

632
01:21:10,782 --> 01:21:12,241
Fire!

633
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:31,260
Steersman, ram course! Order below!
Ramming speed!

634
01:21:31,469 --> 01:21:32,636
Ramming speed!

635
01:21:44,107 --> 01:21:46,650
Consul, barge on ramming course.

636
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:57,870
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!

637
01:26:52,957 --> 01:26:54,374
Why did you save me?

638
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:59,713
Why did you have me unchained?

639
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:22,945
What is your name, 41?

640
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:26,782
Judah Ben-Hur.

641
01:27:27,784 --> 01:27:29,701
Judah Ben-Hur...

642
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:32,663
...let me die.

643
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:39,211
We keep you alive to serve this ship.

644
01:27:39,629 --> 01:27:41,171
Row well and live.

645
01:27:57,146 --> 01:27:58,438
Is the sail square?

646
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:02,359
I can't tell.

647
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:06,363
Better for us both if it's the enemy.

648
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:08,865
My death.

649
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:11,159
Your freedom.

650
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:17,958
It's a Roman sail.

651
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:49,197
Face rear!

652
01:28:49,407 --> 01:28:53,410
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.

653
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:57,998
Water.

654
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:04,421
The fleet, all lost?

655
01:29:04,672 --> 01:29:06,298
Five galleys.

656
01:29:06,924 --> 01:29:10,260
- And the battle?
- The battle was won.

657
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:12,012
You have a victory.

658
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:15,599
It was a victory?
Complete.

659
01:29:34,327 --> 01:29:36,578
In his eagerness to save you...

660
01:29:36,829 --> 01:29:40,457
...your God has also saved
the Roman fleet.

661
01:30:14,951 --> 01:30:17,577
Hail Arrius!

662
01:30:17,787 --> 01:30:19,496
Hail Arrius!

663
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:22,249
Right oars!

664
01:33:15,673 --> 01:33:20,176
You have cleared the seaways
of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.

665
01:33:21,095 --> 01:33:24,556
This baton of victory
has been nobly won.

666
01:33:32,356 --> 01:33:35,358
This man riding beside you, who is he?

667
01:33:35,818 --> 01:33:38,862
The man who saved me, divine emperor,
to return and serve you.

668
01:33:39,113 --> 01:33:41,156
Is that all you know about him?

669
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:48,371
No. He was accused of an attack
on the governor of Judea.

670
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:50,498
But he was innocent.

671
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:53,501
If not, there's a strange
inconsistency in this man...

672
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:58,131
...who tries to kill my governor,
yet saves the life of my consul.

673
01:33:59,091 --> 01:34:02,052
Come tomorrow. We'll talk of it.

674
01:34:31,749 --> 01:34:34,668
We have all the information
on this man...

675
01:34:34,877 --> 01:34:37,337
...a man of some influence
in his own country.

676
01:34:37,713 --> 01:34:41,883
His attack upon our governor is one
upon the senate and the people of Rome.

677
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:44,928
I am convinced that
no such attack was intended.

678
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:48,765
Consul, allow us to continue.

679
01:34:49,934 --> 01:34:52,394
Allow us to be generous.

680
01:34:53,604 --> 01:34:56,856
As a reward to you
for your great victory...

681
01:34:57,191 --> 01:34:59,776
...we shall not send him
back to the galleys.

682
01:34:59,944 --> 01:35:04,280
We give him to you as your slave
to do with him as you like.

683
01:35:05,449 --> 01:35:07,742
Such is the will of the senate...

684
01:35:08,577 --> 01:35:10,537
...and the people of Rome.

685
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:33,453
Not long ago, I returned to Rome...

686
01:36:33,704 --> 01:36:36,456
...with a young man
who had saved my life.

687
01:36:36,707 --> 01:36:39,876
You all know him as
the finest charioteer in Rome.

688
01:36:40,085 --> 01:36:43,046
Five times, he's driven
my horses to victory.

689
01:36:49,929 --> 01:36:54,599
I know him as one who stands
in the place of the son I lost.

690
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:58,353
I have the love and pride
in a son's achievements...

691
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:00,939
...which I thought
I should never have again.

692
01:37:06,403 --> 01:37:08,571
Nothing could make stronger
the bond between us...

693
01:37:08,739 --> 01:37:11,282
...but tonight I wish
to share it with you all.

694
01:37:12,451 --> 01:37:16,412
The formalities of adoption
have been completed.

695
01:37:16,622 --> 01:37:19,791
Young Arrius is now
the legal bearer of my name...

696
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,252
...and the heir to my property.

697
01:37:26,882 --> 01:37:29,259
This ring of my ancestors...

698
01:37:29,885 --> 01:37:31,928
...would have gone to my son.

699
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:35,932
So now it is yours.

700
01:37:56,954 --> 01:38:01,708
It's a strange destiny that
brought me to a new life...

701
01:38:02,501 --> 01:38:04,127
...a new home...

702
01:38:05,045 --> 01:38:06,546
...a new father.

703
01:38:08,048 --> 01:38:10,174
It brought me here.

704
01:38:10,843 --> 01:38:12,844
It may take me away.

705
01:38:13,637 --> 01:38:15,471
But wherever I may be...

706
01:38:15,681 --> 01:38:19,851
...I shall always try to wear this ring
as a son of Arrius should.

707
01:38:20,436 --> 01:38:23,521
With gratitude and affection...

708
01:38:24,815 --> 01:38:26,149
...and with honor.

709
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:44,792
I present my son to you.

710
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:48,254
My old friend Pontius Pilate,
young Arrius.

711
01:38:48,505 --> 01:38:51,674
Before you came to this city,
my horses always won.

712
01:38:51,884 --> 01:38:53,885
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.

713
01:38:54,094 --> 01:38:56,387
Yes, but not swift enough
to defeat you.

714
01:38:56,597 --> 01:38:59,057
- Tell me, you come from Judea?
- Yes, sir.

715
01:38:59,266 --> 01:39:02,060
I hear that the climate
is difficult to live in.

716
01:39:02,269 --> 01:39:04,187
Not for Judeans.

717
01:39:07,858 --> 01:39:11,194
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.

718
01:39:11,403 --> 01:39:13,196
- Of Judea?
- Yes.

719
01:39:13,364 --> 01:39:14,864
I asked for Alexandria.

720
01:39:15,032 --> 01:39:17,909
But it seems the wilderness
needs my particular talents.

721
01:39:18,118 --> 01:39:21,204
The scorpions and holy prophets
can't get on without me.

722
01:39:21,413 --> 01:39:24,874
Lay the dust of Judea,
at least for this evening.

723
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:26,793
Goats and Jehovah.

724
01:39:46,063 --> 01:39:47,438
You're leaving.

725
01:39:50,609 --> 01:39:52,110
I must.

726
01:39:53,529 --> 01:39:55,947
It's a journey I can't keep you from.

727
01:39:57,533 --> 01:40:01,953
Your eyes have never left it all
these months. I can recognize pain.

728
01:40:02,162 --> 01:40:05,915
But still, my counsel is to wait.

729
01:40:06,125 --> 01:40:08,584
Gratus is to be replaced.

730
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:12,046
The governorship goes
to Pontius Pilate.

731
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:16,968
When?

732
01:40:17,469 --> 01:40:18,928
Very soon.

733
01:40:19,555 --> 01:40:21,806
It's very much to our purpose.

734
01:40:22,975 --> 01:40:27,603
Nothing is to the purpose if, when
I come back to Judea, I come too late.

735
01:40:30,774 --> 01:40:34,986
That is the thought which has punished
me every moment I've spent here.

736
01:40:41,952 --> 01:40:44,287
Will Rome see you again?

737
01:40:51,378 --> 01:40:54,964
Here is a part of my life
which you have made for me.

738
01:40:56,508 --> 01:40:58,342
I shall remember it.

739
01:41:01,597 --> 01:41:05,975
Whoever the gods are, they take
small interest in an old man's hopes.

740
01:41:06,894 --> 01:41:08,311
They have their way.

741
01:42:49,163 --> 01:42:50,663
Forgive me.

742
01:42:51,039 --> 01:42:53,249
You're a stranger here.

743
01:42:54,501 --> 01:42:56,919
Would you be from Nazareth?

744
01:42:59,173 --> 01:43:00,590
Why do you ask?

745
01:43:01,049 --> 01:43:02,091
I thought...

746
01:43:03,719 --> 01:43:06,012
...you might be the one...

747
01:43:08,015 --> 01:43:11,601
The one that I have come back
from my country to find.

748
01:43:15,564 --> 01:43:18,024
He would be about your age.

749
01:43:19,193 --> 01:43:21,110
Who?

750
01:43:23,739 --> 01:43:25,573
When I find him...

751
01:43:26,950 --> 01:43:28,492
...I shall know him.

752
01:43:33,832 --> 01:43:37,210
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.

753
01:43:37,461 --> 01:43:39,295
I am the guest of Sheik llderim.

754
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:42,590
Hyah! Hyah! Sack of flesh without brains!

755
01:43:42,799 --> 01:43:45,551
No! No! Not the whip!

756
01:43:47,137 --> 01:43:48,221
That is my host.

757
01:43:48,430 --> 01:43:49,597
Gently! Gently!

758
01:43:50,224 --> 01:43:53,726
Fool! Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!

759
01:43:53,936 --> 01:43:57,313
Whip my children once and
I'll drain every drop of your blood!

760
01:43:57,522 --> 01:44:01,651
Now, gently around the first turn,
and let them run! Go on!

761
01:44:06,865 --> 01:44:10,368
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!

762
01:44:11,203 --> 01:44:12,453
Beautiful horses.

763
01:44:24,132 --> 01:44:26,592
Now! Now! They are ready!
Let them go!

764
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:35,810
Watch. They'll never hold the turn.

765
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:40,564
No! No!

766
01:44:42,401 --> 01:44:44,568
Abadon, stop him!

767
01:44:46,571 --> 01:44:47,947
Stop that whip!

768
01:44:48,156 --> 01:44:50,157
I'll kill him! I'll kill!

769
01:44:55,664 --> 01:44:58,833
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!

770
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:04,672
You think you can treat
my horses like animals?

771
01:45:06,174 --> 01:45:09,010
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!

772
01:45:09,261 --> 01:45:10,845
Get off, idiot!

773
01:45:16,184 --> 01:45:17,768
Drive goats, not horses!

774
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:20,146
Now I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?

775
01:45:20,355 --> 01:45:23,607
This traveler told what would happen
before it happened.

776
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:25,318
Hmm?

777
01:45:25,527 --> 01:45:28,487
Your horses are very fine,
but they're not a team.

778
01:45:28,697 --> 01:45:30,114
Not a team?

779
01:45:30,324 --> 01:45:33,159
But one of them held steady,
the one on the outside.

780
01:45:33,368 --> 01:45:35,661
- Antares.
- The slow one?

781
01:45:35,912 --> 01:45:37,121
Uh-huh.

782
01:45:37,289 --> 01:45:40,958
I think he should run on the inside where
he can steady the others in the turns.

783
01:45:45,964 --> 01:45:49,383
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?

784
01:45:49,593 --> 01:45:51,469
In the circus in Rome.

785
01:45:53,513 --> 01:45:56,098
You have driven in the great circus?

786
01:45:57,809 --> 01:46:02,146
Tell me, my friend, could you
make my four run as one?

787
01:46:02,397 --> 01:46:03,939
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.

788
01:46:04,149 --> 01:46:06,233
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?

789
01:46:06,485 --> 01:46:08,569
We have time enough
to eat, drink and talk.

790
01:46:08,779 --> 01:46:10,946
Come into my tent
and refresh yourself.

791
01:46:11,156 --> 01:46:14,533
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.

792
01:46:16,411 --> 01:46:20,373
If I had a voice to sing,
I would sing you the psalm of horses.

793
01:46:20,582 --> 01:46:23,250
No other animal has
descended so in scale...

794
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:26,045
...from the first innocent falling
of the world.

795
01:46:27,422 --> 01:46:30,841
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares
on the inside.

796
01:46:31,051 --> 01:46:34,512
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.

797
01:46:35,013 --> 01:46:37,014
Judah Ben-Hur.

798
01:46:37,224 --> 01:46:40,059
You're a Jew,
yet you drove in the great circus.

799
01:46:40,268 --> 01:46:41,435
Yes.

800
01:46:43,021 --> 01:46:47,024
By a strange choice
and a stranger fortune.

801
01:46:47,859 --> 01:46:50,486
Your coming here was so fit, so right.

802
01:46:50,695 --> 01:46:53,280
We might have achieved wonders.

803
01:46:53,490 --> 01:46:55,324
You have to go.

804
01:46:59,746 --> 01:47:01,789
I make a journey which will not wait.

805
01:47:01,998 --> 01:47:04,333
Well, then perhaps you will come back.

806
01:47:04,543 --> 01:47:06,961
And when you do,
bring your friends, your wives.

807
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:08,879
I have no wives.

808
01:47:09,131 --> 01:47:11,048
No wives at all?

809
01:47:11,383 --> 01:47:13,676
I have six, no, seven.

810
01:47:13,885 --> 01:47:15,553
Ha, ha. I've counted eight.

811
01:47:15,846 --> 01:47:19,056
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.

812
01:47:19,266 --> 01:47:22,643
Believe me, it is a great advantage
to have many wives.

813
01:47:22,853 --> 01:47:25,271
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!

814
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:30,151
Ha, ha, one God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.

815
01:47:30,485 --> 01:47:31,861
It is not generous.

816
01:47:37,701 --> 01:47:41,454
- Was the food not to your liking?
- Indeed.

817
01:47:53,425 --> 01:47:55,342
Thank you. Thank you.

818
01:47:55,552 --> 01:48:00,222
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.

819
01:48:01,433 --> 01:48:05,019
And now I must say good night
to my beauties.

820
01:48:05,687 --> 01:48:08,481
When they're ready for sleep,
they get impatient and jealous.

821
01:48:08,690 --> 01:48:11,525
They wait to see which one
I will embrace first.

822
01:48:12,068 --> 01:48:14,403
- I'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.

823
01:48:14,613 --> 01:48:16,572
Stay and see them.

824
01:48:30,462 --> 01:48:33,380
Come, my children. Come.

825
01:48:39,471 --> 01:48:41,138
Strangers make them shy.

826
01:48:42,307 --> 01:48:43,390
Come.

827
01:48:43,850 --> 01:48:46,685
Come, do not be afraid. Come.

828
01:48:52,484 --> 01:48:54,527
There, my children.

829
01:48:54,861 --> 01:48:57,696
They are descended from
the Arabians of the first Pharaohs...

830
01:48:57,906 --> 01:49:00,241
...and I have named them
for the stars.

831
01:49:01,952 --> 01:49:03,536
Come, Antares.

832
01:49:03,787 --> 01:49:06,413
You are the slowest, and you can
run all day without tiring.

833
01:49:07,791 --> 01:49:10,084
What? Yes, yes.

834
01:49:10,293 --> 01:49:14,088
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.

835
01:49:14,339 --> 01:49:15,548
Come, Rigel.

836
01:49:15,757 --> 01:49:18,634
We've both supped well,
and the world is good.

837
01:49:20,011 --> 01:49:21,053
There's my good Rigel.

838
01:49:23,306 --> 01:49:25,641
Yes, you are ready for sleep.

839
01:49:26,935 --> 01:49:29,270
The day's work done for you, eh?

840
01:49:29,437 --> 01:49:33,107
Ah. Yes, well, you can go
to sleep in a minute.

841
01:49:33,358 --> 01:49:35,776
Good night. Good night, my treasure.

842
01:49:36,903 --> 01:49:41,115
Ah! Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.

843
01:49:41,366 --> 01:49:45,035
No. You are the swiftest,
but you must be steady.

844
01:49:47,581 --> 01:49:49,957
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.

845
01:49:50,166 --> 01:49:52,167
You should see their mother, Mira.

846
01:49:52,377 --> 01:49:55,421
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.

847
01:49:55,630 --> 01:49:57,590
All right, all right.

848
01:50:02,012 --> 01:50:05,764
You are their friend, and they do
not give their affections readily.

849
01:50:06,516 --> 01:50:10,102
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.

850
01:50:10,895 --> 01:50:15,149
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.

851
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:18,402
You must be strong and swift.

852
01:50:18,612 --> 01:50:21,071
Go, my children. Go.

853
01:50:25,452 --> 01:50:28,537
When they reach Jerusalem,
they'll race the world's finest teams...

854
01:50:28,747 --> 01:50:32,541
...not to mention the champion of the East,
Messala, with his black devils.

855
01:50:32,709 --> 01:50:34,376
He stops at nothing to win.

856
01:50:34,628 --> 01:50:37,463
- Messala? In the circus?
- Yes.

857
01:50:37,672 --> 01:50:39,340
You knew him?

858
01:50:40,425 --> 01:50:41,634
I know him.

859
01:50:42,010 --> 01:50:44,219
Perhaps without much liking.

860
01:50:47,766 --> 01:50:50,267
Judah Ben-Hur,
my people are praying for a man...

861
01:50:50,435 --> 01:50:52,311
...to drive their team
to victory over Messala.

862
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:54,647
You could be that man, the one...

863
01:50:54,856 --> 01:50:56,982
...to stamp his arrogance
into the sand.

864
01:50:57,192 --> 01:51:00,319
My horses need only a driver
who is worthy of them...

865
01:51:00,570 --> 01:51:04,198
...one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.

866
01:51:04,407 --> 01:51:06,158
It's not possible.

867
01:51:07,452 --> 01:51:09,078
That is a pity.

868
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:12,122
Think of it. To break his pride...

869
01:51:12,332 --> 01:51:15,834
...to humble this tribune before
the very people he has degraded.

870
01:51:16,044 --> 01:51:20,589
Just think, his defeat and humiliation
at the hands of a Jew!

871
01:51:21,216 --> 01:51:23,384
I know it is not possible.

872
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:26,512
Does it not delight your imagination?

873
01:51:27,972 --> 01:51:30,307
Does it not answer your purpose?

874
01:51:31,351 --> 01:51:33,560
I must deal with Messala
in my own way.

875
01:51:34,229 --> 01:51:36,397
And your way is to kill him.

876
01:51:40,193 --> 01:51:43,070
I see this terrible thing
in your eyes, Judah Ben-Hur.

877
01:51:43,446 --> 01:51:47,658
But no matter what this man has done,
you have no right to take his life.

878
01:51:48,076 --> 01:51:50,452
He will be punished inevitably.

879
01:51:51,538 --> 01:51:53,163
I don't believe in miracles.

880
01:51:54,207 --> 01:51:56,125
But all life is a miracle.

881
01:51:56,334 --> 01:51:58,669
Why will you not
accept God's judgment?

882
01:52:01,548 --> 01:52:03,465
You do not believe in miracles.

883
01:52:04,342 --> 01:52:07,386
Yet God once spoke to me
out of the darkness...

884
01:52:07,595 --> 01:52:10,264
...and a star led me
to a village called Bethlehem...

885
01:52:10,473 --> 01:52:13,559
...where I found a newborn child
in a manger.

886
01:52:13,768 --> 01:52:15,644
And God lived in this child.

887
01:52:16,771 --> 01:52:20,649
By now, he is a grown man
and must be ready to begin his work.

888
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:22,568
That is why I have returned here...

889
01:52:22,777 --> 01:52:25,571
...so that I may be at hand
when he comes among us.

890
01:52:27,782 --> 01:52:29,366
He is near.

891
01:52:30,368 --> 01:52:33,996
He saw the sun set this evening,
as we did.

892
01:52:34,539 --> 01:52:38,459
Perhaps he's standing in a doorway
somewhere or on a hilltop.

893
01:52:39,127 --> 01:52:41,295
Perhaps he is a shepherd...

894
01:52:41,504 --> 01:52:44,381
...a merchant, a fisherman.

895
01:52:44,883 --> 01:52:46,592
But he lives...

896
01:52:46,801 --> 01:52:51,138
...and all our lives from now on
will carry his mark.

897
01:52:53,308 --> 01:52:56,059
There are many paths to God, my son.

898
01:52:57,187 --> 01:52:59,438
I hope yours will not
be too difficult.

899
01:53:10,283 --> 01:53:12,117
I'm ready for sleep.

900
01:53:26,549 --> 01:53:28,967
Balthasar is a good man...

901
01:53:29,177 --> 01:53:33,430
...but until all men are like him,
we must keep our swords bright.

902
01:53:33,723 --> 01:53:35,808
And our intention true.

903
01:53:36,976 --> 01:53:38,727
So I must leave you.

904
01:53:40,939 --> 01:53:42,815
One last thought.

905
01:53:43,024 --> 01:53:45,734
There is no law in the arena.

906
01:53:46,611 --> 01:53:48,445
Many are killed.

907
01:53:51,950 --> 01:53:53,992
I hope to see you again.

908
01:54:08,508 --> 01:54:10,884
Fine Damascus silk.

909
01:54:11,177 --> 01:54:13,512
Fine Damascus silk.

910
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:21,682
Esther?

911
01:56:33,569 --> 01:56:35,320
It's Judah.

912
01:56:39,784 --> 01:56:41,410
Judah.

913
01:56:43,579 --> 01:56:45,497
- You are alive.
- Esther.

914
01:56:46,541 --> 01:56:48,792
You are alive.

915
01:56:50,545 --> 01:56:53,880
What are you doing here?
What has happened?

916
01:57:00,471 --> 01:57:02,222
Shh.

917
01:57:03,933 --> 01:57:05,267
I'm here.

918
01:57:07,228 --> 01:57:08,395
I'm with you.

919
01:57:10,148 --> 01:57:11,231
Esther.

920
01:57:14,902 --> 01:57:16,570
Where's your father?

921
01:57:17,113 --> 01:57:18,530
Hmm?

922
01:57:21,576 --> 01:57:25,412
The day they took you away,
they imprisoned him.

923
01:57:25,872 --> 01:57:27,664
They tortured him.

924
01:57:28,124 --> 01:57:32,669
When they were sure he was hiding
nothing, they let him go.

925
01:57:34,130 --> 01:57:38,884
Ever since then, we have been
living here, in hiding.

926
01:57:39,510 --> 01:57:41,720
You never went back to Antioch?

927
01:57:42,096 --> 01:57:43,263
No.

928
01:57:43,514 --> 01:57:47,934
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.

929
01:57:49,604 --> 01:57:54,274
Esther.

930
01:57:54,484 --> 01:57:56,443
Where are my mother and sister?

931
01:58:03,451 --> 01:58:04,493
Esther.

932
01:58:06,079 --> 01:58:08,121
Let me tell him first.

933
01:58:26,641 --> 01:58:27,849
Father.

934
01:58:29,102 --> 01:58:31,812
Father, something wonderful
has happened.

935
01:58:33,147 --> 01:58:35,232
- Judah Ben-Hur is alive.
- Judah.

936
01:58:36,651 --> 01:58:39,986
He has come home. He is here.

937
01:58:57,672 --> 01:58:59,005
Judah.

938
01:59:00,842 --> 01:59:03,176
Judah Ben-Hur.

939
01:59:05,847 --> 01:59:08,014
My dear old friend.

940
01:59:10,017 --> 01:59:11,977
Let me look at you.

941
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:14,062
Let me see you.

942
01:59:15,481 --> 01:59:18,441
Yes, yes. It is true.

943
01:59:19,193 --> 01:59:22,779
Praise God for his mercy.

944
01:59:44,343 --> 01:59:45,719
Where are they?

945
01:59:46,929 --> 01:59:50,140
Since that terrible day...

946
01:59:51,058 --> 01:59:53,602
...there has been no word of them.

947
02:00:09,452 --> 02:00:11,453
You should have been less loyal.

948
02:00:11,662 --> 02:00:13,663
Do not pity me, Master Judah.

949
02:00:13,873 --> 02:00:16,917
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.

950
02:00:18,461 --> 02:00:22,589
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.

951
02:00:22,798 --> 02:00:24,883
We were released on the same day.

952
02:00:25,092 --> 02:00:29,930
Malluch without a tongue,
and I without life in my legs.

953
02:00:30,139 --> 02:00:32,557
Since then, I have been his tongue...

954
02:00:32,767 --> 02:00:34,434
...and he has been my legs.

955
02:00:34,644 --> 02:00:37,854
Together, we make a considerable man.

956
02:00:39,774 --> 02:00:41,399
Old friend.

957
02:00:42,860 --> 02:00:45,654
She always said you would return.

958
02:00:45,863 --> 02:00:48,198
She never gave up hope.

959
02:00:50,284 --> 02:00:52,869
Though I hoped it,
I didn't believe it.

960
02:00:54,163 --> 02:00:57,999
I see that your one thought is
to save your mother and sister.

961
02:00:59,335 --> 02:01:01,628
But suppose that isn't possible.

962
02:01:01,837 --> 02:01:04,422
If one purpose fails,
it is good to have another.

963
02:01:05,341 --> 02:01:07,467
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.

964
02:01:07,677 --> 02:01:10,595
They could not make me
tell them where it is.

965
02:01:10,805 --> 02:01:11,930
It is there still...

966
02:01:12,139 --> 02:01:15,558
...to put power into our hands
and buy death for the Romans.

967
02:01:18,854 --> 02:01:21,189
That's not why I came back.

968
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:24,359
Judah, they are dead.

969
02:01:24,777 --> 02:01:29,447
Four years. No one could live
so long in the dungeons.

970
02:01:34,203 --> 02:01:37,122
Who lives more than one year
in the galleys?

971
02:01:37,832 --> 02:01:40,041
Yes, it is true.

972
02:01:42,378 --> 02:01:45,213
Judah Ben-Hur.

973
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:51,636
You have come back to us
like a returning faith.

974
02:01:51,846 --> 02:01:54,973
Judah, I should like to laugh again.

975
02:01:55,182 --> 02:01:56,516
- Let us laugh.
- We will.

976
02:01:56,726 --> 02:01:58,601
There will be joy again in this house.

977
02:01:58,811 --> 02:02:01,062
We will celebrate among the dust.

978
02:02:14,744 --> 02:02:16,202
I will take him.

979
02:02:47,777 --> 02:02:49,736
We stood here before.

980
02:02:52,990 --> 02:02:55,033
A long while ago.

981
02:02:56,160 --> 02:02:57,577
Four years.

982
02:03:01,457 --> 02:03:03,249
But now it seems as if...

983
02:03:03,876 --> 02:03:05,794
...only yesterday...

984
02:03:07,713 --> 02:03:09,214
I was saying:

985
02:03:11,467 --> 02:03:15,220
"If you were not a bride,
I should kiss you goodbye."

986
02:03:17,264 --> 02:03:19,391
"If I were not a bride...

987
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:22,394
...there would be
no goodbyes to be said."

988
02:03:33,114 --> 02:03:34,948
I am not a bride.

989
02:04:06,897 --> 02:04:09,149
Why did you never marry?

990
02:04:11,318 --> 02:04:13,111
My father needed me.

991
02:04:17,867 --> 02:04:19,242
And also...

992
02:04:28,169 --> 02:04:30,170
It's still on my finger.

993
02:04:32,506 --> 02:04:37,260
I said I should wear it
till I met a woman I would marry.

994
02:04:44,185 --> 02:04:46,853
It's become a part of my hand.

995
02:04:55,654 --> 02:04:58,698
If Messala once knew you were here...

996
02:04:59,158 --> 02:05:00,575
As he must.

997
02:05:01,160 --> 02:05:03,119
He will know where they are.

998
02:05:11,170 --> 02:05:12,921
And if you should find?

999
02:05:15,674 --> 02:05:19,385
- If he should tell you they're dead...
- Then Messala will wish they were living.

1000
02:05:24,934 --> 02:05:28,186
I've seen too much
of what hate can do.

1001
02:05:28,771 --> 02:05:30,980
My father is burned up with it.

1002
02:05:33,067 --> 02:05:37,695
But I've heard of a young rabbi who
says that forgiveness is greater...

1003
02:05:37,905 --> 02:05:40,740
...and love more powerful than hatred.

1004
02:05:41,867 --> 02:05:43,368
I believe it.

1005
02:05:43,994 --> 02:05:45,912
- Esther.
- Judah.

1006
02:05:46,455 --> 02:05:48,122
Stay alive.

1007
02:05:48,707 --> 02:05:50,667
Keep away from Messala.

1008
02:05:50,918 --> 02:05:53,753
Only if I can give up
thinking and feeling.

1009
02:05:55,881 --> 02:05:57,882
That time isn't yet come.

1010
02:05:58,092 --> 02:06:02,595
The stone that fell from this roof
so long ago is still falling.

1011
02:06:03,097 --> 02:06:05,807
Only this time you won't be sent
to the galleys.

1012
02:06:06,016 --> 02:06:08,226
This time you will be destroyed.

1013
02:06:08,435 --> 02:06:09,978
You'll die.

1014
02:06:53,814 --> 02:06:57,358
Tribune, compliments of Quintus
Arrius. He awaits your pleasure.

1015
02:06:57,568 --> 02:07:00,236
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.

1016
02:07:00,446 --> 02:07:02,530
Thank him. Bring him to me.

1017
02:07:03,365 --> 02:07:08,661
- I didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.

1018
02:07:09,371 --> 02:07:11,414
Why is he here presenting me with gifts?

1019
02:07:11,582 --> 02:07:14,959
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
- Look.

1020
02:07:16,879 --> 02:07:18,588
It's magnificent.

1021
02:07:18,797 --> 02:07:20,715
And from a man I've never met.

1022
02:07:20,924 --> 02:07:22,967
You're wrong, Messala.

1023
02:07:36,774 --> 02:07:38,024
Judah.

1024
02:07:47,534 --> 02:07:50,536
By what magic do you bear
the name of a consul of Rome?

1025
02:07:51,872 --> 02:07:54,165
You were the magician, Messala.

1026
02:07:54,375 --> 02:07:56,668
You condemned me to the galleys.

1027
02:07:57,419 --> 02:08:00,213
When my ship was sunk,
I saved the consul's life.

1028
02:08:12,434 --> 02:08:14,060
You know his seal?

1029
02:08:26,073 --> 02:08:27,990
Now I have come back...

1030
02:08:28,283 --> 02:08:30,660
...as I swore I would.

1031
02:08:36,166 --> 02:08:40,378
Your gift is exquisitely
appropriate, young Arrius.

1032
02:08:41,422 --> 02:08:44,132
You suggest I use it on myself?

1033
02:08:45,634 --> 02:08:49,512
What has become of
my mother and my sister?

1034
02:08:53,267 --> 02:08:56,310
It is not my duty
to keep track of prisoners.

1035
02:08:56,979 --> 02:08:58,312
Find them, Messala.

1036
02:08:59,815 --> 02:09:02,358
Restore them to me,
and I'll forget what I vowed...

1037
02:09:02,568 --> 02:09:06,112
...with every stroke of that oar
you chained me to.

1038
02:09:09,700 --> 02:09:12,785
I am not the governor of Judea.
I can do nothing without approval.

1039
02:09:12,995 --> 02:09:14,162
Then get it.

1040
02:09:18,959 --> 02:09:21,169
I will come back tomorrow.

1041
02:09:22,087 --> 02:09:24,881
Don't disappoint me, Messala.

1042
02:09:39,772 --> 02:09:41,439
What became of them?

1043
02:09:41,732 --> 02:09:45,276
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?

1044
02:09:45,486 --> 02:09:48,112
Go to the citadel, Drusus. Find out.

1045
02:09:48,322 --> 02:09:50,531
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!

1046
02:10:05,506 --> 02:10:08,591
"Miriam, wife. Tirzah, daughter."

1047
02:10:08,801 --> 02:10:11,344
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?

1048
02:10:11,804 --> 02:10:13,179
East section...

1049
02:10:14,473 --> 02:10:15,973
...lower level.

1050
02:10:17,100 --> 02:10:20,353
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.

1051
02:10:38,038 --> 02:10:39,205
Water.

1052
02:10:39,748 --> 02:10:40,873
Water.

1053
02:10:41,500 --> 02:10:42,792
Let me out!

1054
02:10:43,669 --> 02:10:45,336
Hear us! Hear us!

1055
02:11:18,412 --> 02:11:21,289
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.

1056
02:11:21,540 --> 02:11:25,585
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.

1057
02:11:28,839 --> 02:11:30,548
The food disappears.

1058
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:06,375
Lepers.

1059
02:12:35,656 --> 02:12:38,532
They must be taken outside the city
and released at once.

1060
02:12:38,784 --> 02:12:40,409
Then we'll burn out the cell.

1061
02:13:27,332 --> 02:13:28,874
Is someone there?

1062
02:13:34,506 --> 02:13:36,632
There is someone there.

1063
02:13:49,980 --> 02:13:51,272
Who are you?

1064
02:13:54,359 --> 02:13:56,152
Don't come any closer.

1065
02:13:59,448 --> 02:14:00,489
Who are you?

1066
02:14:03,827 --> 02:14:04,869
Esther.

1067
02:14:06,872 --> 02:14:08,205
It's Miriam.

1068
02:14:08,790 --> 02:14:09,874
Miriam.

1069
02:14:12,210 --> 02:14:13,502
Miriam?

1070
02:14:16,173 --> 02:14:18,340
Stay where you are.

1071
02:14:20,552 --> 02:14:22,428
You have come home.

1072
02:14:24,181 --> 02:14:26,307
Stand back, Esther.

1073
02:14:34,941 --> 02:14:36,400
We are lepers.

1074
02:14:49,998 --> 02:14:51,624
Oh, Esther.

1075
02:14:53,543 --> 02:14:54,835
Tirzah.

1076
02:15:03,595 --> 02:15:05,054
Esther...

1077
02:15:06,848 --> 02:15:09,141
...is Judah living?

1078
02:15:09,935 --> 02:15:12,770
Yes, he is alive.

1079
02:15:13,563 --> 02:15:15,272
He is here.

1080
02:15:18,318 --> 02:15:19,819
Where?

1081
02:15:21,071 --> 02:15:24,490
He is searching for you now.

1082
02:15:24,866 --> 02:15:27,743
I must find him and tell him.

1083
02:15:27,953 --> 02:15:29,161
No!
- Tell my father.

1084
02:15:29,371 --> 02:15:30,538
No.

1085
02:15:31,498 --> 02:15:33,207
Tell no one.

1086
02:15:35,919 --> 02:15:39,380
We are going away
to the Valley of the Lepers.

1087
02:15:39,798 --> 02:15:41,382
We won't return.

1088
02:15:42,968 --> 02:15:44,385
But...

1089
02:15:44,553 --> 02:15:46,679
...Judah has to be told.

1090
02:15:47,097 --> 02:15:48,139
No.

1091
02:15:51,184 --> 02:15:52,309
Please.

1092
02:16:11,621 --> 02:16:14,081
I couldn't see his face.

1093
02:16:15,917 --> 02:16:17,501
Is it changed?

1094
02:16:20,422 --> 02:16:23,507
No, he is not changed.

1095
02:16:24,467 --> 02:16:25,509
He...

1096
02:16:29,181 --> 02:16:30,973
He's not changed.

1097
02:16:33,310 --> 02:16:35,436
You love him, Esther.

1098
02:16:46,531 --> 02:16:48,240
Promise me...

1099
02:16:48,867 --> 02:16:50,951
...on your love for him...

1100
02:16:52,204 --> 02:16:54,872
...you will never tell him
you've seen us.

1101
02:17:03,965 --> 02:17:05,966
Is he never to know?

1102
02:17:09,971 --> 02:17:12,514
Let him remember us as we were.

1103
02:17:14,100 --> 02:17:15,309
Promise me.

1104
02:17:25,987 --> 02:17:29,281
There's nothing else I can hope for.

1105
02:17:30,325 --> 02:17:31,992
Only this.

1106
02:17:39,125 --> 02:17:40,834
I promise you.

1107
02:17:44,923 --> 02:17:46,674
I am content.

1108
02:18:06,069 --> 02:18:07,278
Wait.

1109
02:18:53,366 --> 02:18:55,492
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.

1110
02:18:55,702 --> 02:18:59,788
I pray to God they're alive
and that Messala will free them.

1111
02:18:59,998 --> 02:19:01,874
He'll free them.

1112
02:19:02,083 --> 02:19:04,209
He wants to survive.

1113
02:19:05,712 --> 02:19:07,504
He cannot free them, Judah.

1114
02:19:11,343 --> 02:19:12,384
What do you mean?

1115
02:19:21,519 --> 02:19:24,646
- I saw them.
- You saw them?

1116
02:19:24,856 --> 02:19:26,023
Where?

1117
02:19:26,232 --> 02:19:27,900
When did you see them?

1118
02:19:33,531 --> 02:19:39,244
They were dead.

1119
02:19:41,331 --> 02:19:42,373
When?

1120
02:19:44,042 --> 02:19:46,418
When? When?

1121
02:19:48,755 --> 02:19:50,172
In the prison.

1122
02:19:52,384 --> 02:19:55,260
When I was waiting
for news of my father.

1123
02:19:59,891 --> 02:20:01,683
Why didn't you tell me?

1124
02:20:07,399 --> 02:20:08,816
I couldn't tell you.

1125
02:20:10,068 --> 02:20:11,819
Nor even you, Father.

1126
02:20:13,488 --> 02:20:15,906
I was afraid that
if you saw Messala...

1127
02:20:16,699 --> 02:20:19,952
Judah, you have come
to the end of your search.

1128
02:20:20,161 --> 02:20:21,537
It's over now.

1129
02:20:22,038 --> 02:20:23,247
Over?

1130
02:20:24,165 --> 02:20:25,749
- Judah.
- Over?

1131
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:30,254
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.

1132
02:26:11,137 --> 02:26:13,472
Gentlemen. Officers.

1133
02:26:15,475 --> 02:26:18,226
Defenders of great Rome's imperium...

1134
02:26:19,061 --> 02:26:20,729
...may I enter?

1135
02:26:21,397 --> 02:26:22,898
Certainly, sheik.

1136
02:26:23,316 --> 02:26:25,317
You do us an unexpected honor.

1137
02:26:26,444 --> 02:26:28,820
The noble tribune is most gracious.

1138
02:26:38,331 --> 02:26:41,416
And now,
the question you're all asking yourselves:

1139
02:26:41,667 --> 02:26:43,293
Why am I here?

1140
02:26:43,753 --> 02:26:45,712
As you know, I am a gambling man.

1141
02:26:45,922 --> 02:26:47,214
The games approach.

1142
02:26:47,423 --> 02:26:51,801
I am racing my whites against the
noble tribune's undefeated blacks.

1143
02:26:51,969 --> 02:26:54,888
But I will back my own poor horses.

1144
02:26:55,097 --> 02:26:56,598
No limits?

1145
02:27:13,699 --> 02:27:15,242
Mark me first!
- And me!

1146
02:27:15,451 --> 02:27:17,035
What odds?
- A moment, please...

1147
02:27:17,203 --> 02:27:20,205
...my lords, protectors
of the far flung marshes.

1148
02:27:20,456 --> 02:27:21,873
May I first, uh, sit down?

1149
02:27:22,083 --> 02:27:24,125
Sit down. Lie down.
How much will you wager?

1150
02:27:24,293 --> 02:27:26,962
- Yes, let's call his game.
Give the Arab a seat.

1151
02:27:27,213 --> 02:27:29,089
A bench, quickly.

1152
02:27:30,132 --> 02:27:31,466
Thank you.

1153
02:27:34,845 --> 02:27:36,972
- Now.
- One thousand denarii.

1154
02:27:37,223 --> 02:27:39,724
- Two thousand!
- Mark me!

1155
02:27:39,892 --> 02:27:41,977
Your spirit does you credit,
but do not be impatient.

1156
02:27:42,144 --> 02:27:44,729
There is time and money enough for all.

1157
02:27:45,106 --> 02:27:48,233
First, gentlemen, the odds.

1158
02:27:48,734 --> 02:27:52,237
The tribune has won many times. The
odds should be in the same measure.

1159
02:27:52,405 --> 02:27:55,490
Now, what is your pleasure, gentlemen?

1160
02:27:56,617 --> 02:27:57,909
Two to one.

1161
02:27:59,787 --> 02:28:03,873
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber,
masters of the Earth...

1162
02:28:04,083 --> 02:28:07,752
...where is the courage
that made Rome master of the world?

1163
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:10,630
I can get better odds
on any street market.

1164
02:28:11,465 --> 02:28:12,882
Three to one.

1165
02:28:13,384 --> 02:28:15,635
Let us not haggle. Let us be fair.

1166
02:28:15,886 --> 02:28:19,264
In four years, the tribune has won
four victories in the circus.

1167
02:28:19,432 --> 02:28:21,683
- In all truth...
- Just a moment.

1168
02:28:22,768 --> 02:28:25,895
We know you have good horses,
but who is your driver?

1169
02:28:28,482 --> 02:28:31,985
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.

1170
02:28:32,194 --> 02:28:34,195
The Prince of Hur.

1171
02:28:35,906 --> 02:28:38,450
Judah Ben-Hur.

1172
02:28:38,701 --> 02:28:39,951
Prince of Hur?

1173
02:28:41,329 --> 02:28:44,289
- He was sent to the galleys years ago.
- He has returned.

1174
02:28:44,498 --> 02:28:46,708
Returned? Impossible.

1175
02:28:46,917 --> 02:28:50,420
The divine Tiberius is merciful
as always.

1176
02:28:53,132 --> 02:28:54,132
Well?

1177
02:28:54,425 --> 02:28:58,720
Will no one back the noble tribune
against a Jew, a galley slave?

1178
02:29:02,224 --> 02:29:04,559
Perhaps I made a mistake
in coming here.

1179
02:29:08,481 --> 02:29:09,981
You, tribune...

1180
02:29:10,316 --> 02:29:12,317
...will you give me four to one?

1181
02:29:16,572 --> 02:29:17,906
Four to one.

1182
02:29:18,157 --> 02:29:19,699
- Good.
- Bravo, Messala.

1183
02:29:19,867 --> 02:29:24,704
Four to one, sheik. The difference
between a Roman and a Jew.

1184
02:29:24,914 --> 02:29:26,498
Or an Arab.

1185
02:29:32,338 --> 02:29:34,005
Bravely spoken.

1186
02:29:36,092 --> 02:29:40,470
Now we will settle the amount
of our wager. I will venture...

1187
02:29:51,357 --> 02:29:53,274
A thousand talents?

1188
02:29:54,902 --> 02:29:58,988
- A thousand talents?
- Yes, a thousand talents.

1189
02:30:04,787 --> 02:30:06,705
Of course, if it is too much...

1190
02:30:08,207 --> 02:30:10,291
A thousand talents it will be.

1191
02:30:10,710 --> 02:30:11,918
Agreed.

1192
02:30:59,133 --> 02:31:01,718
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.

1193
02:31:13,355 --> 02:31:14,939
You're good fellows.

1194
02:31:15,274 --> 02:31:17,776
If only men were this good.
Hey!

1195
02:31:19,653 --> 02:31:20,945
Remember, Altair...

1196
02:31:21,113 --> 02:31:23,782
...nine times around the circus, huh?

1197
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:27,452
Aldebaran.

1198
02:31:29,538 --> 02:31:30,955
Hey, ha, ha.

1199
02:31:31,373 --> 02:31:33,500
Rigel, did you hear?

1200
02:31:33,709 --> 02:31:35,627
Nine lives to live.

1201
02:31:37,463 --> 02:31:39,464
My swift fellow.

1202
02:31:40,216 --> 02:31:43,676
You must not win the race
the first time around.

1203
02:31:44,345 --> 02:31:46,721
You win the last time around.

1204
02:31:48,057 --> 02:31:52,227
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.

1205
02:31:55,356 --> 02:31:57,690
Steady Antares.

1206
02:31:57,983 --> 02:31:59,484
Like a rock.

1207
02:32:00,986 --> 02:32:02,779
You will be our anchor.

1208
02:32:10,329 --> 02:32:13,039
I thought they'd never love
another as they love me.

1209
02:32:13,249 --> 02:32:15,625
They have taken me into their family.

1210
02:32:16,627 --> 02:32:18,503
Rest well, my stars.

1211
02:32:18,754 --> 02:32:20,797
Tomorrow we go up to the city.

1212
02:32:21,674 --> 02:32:25,802
Then if you defeat Messala and
the new governor there to see it...

1213
02:32:26,053 --> 02:32:28,930
...the news will scorch the streets
of the whole Roman world.

1214
02:32:29,181 --> 02:32:30,223
Pontius Pilate here?

1215
02:32:30,432 --> 02:32:32,433
Yes, and ready to grind
his heel into us.

1216
02:32:32,643 --> 02:32:36,020
You will make him see
what men are born in this land.

1217
02:32:36,605 --> 02:32:40,024
I only know that
I race against Messala.

1218
02:32:56,250 --> 02:32:57,709
Look for the yoke.

1219
02:33:00,045 --> 02:33:01,546
Ease that strap.

1220
02:33:42,588 --> 02:33:47,342
God forgive me for seeking
vengeance, but my path is set.

1221
02:33:47,593 --> 02:33:52,013
Into your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as you will.

1222
02:34:07,446 --> 02:34:09,238
The Star of David.

1223
02:34:09,448 --> 02:34:12,617
To shine out for your people
and my people together...

1224
02:34:12,785 --> 02:34:14,911
...and blind the eyes of Rome.

1225
02:34:17,831 --> 02:34:19,707
They are ready.

1226
02:34:42,439 --> 02:34:44,691
Ready, off!

1227
02:34:47,236 --> 02:34:49,237
Easy, girl, easy.

1228
02:35:28,861 --> 02:35:30,570
Number five.

1229
02:35:31,613 --> 02:35:33,781
Where is number five?

1230
02:36:04,563 --> 02:36:08,483
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.

1231
02:36:08,817 --> 02:36:12,153
Yes, this is the day.

1232
02:36:12,905 --> 02:36:13,946
Judah!

1233
02:36:15,365 --> 02:36:18,409
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.

1234
02:36:34,843 --> 02:36:38,429
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.

1235
02:36:50,067 --> 02:36:53,486
Hail, Jupiter. Give me victory.

1236
02:40:33,749 --> 02:40:36,500
Watch your line! Keep your places!

1237
02:41:00,734 --> 02:41:03,402
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.

1238
02:41:24,966 --> 02:41:26,258
Citizens...

1239
02:41:27,177 --> 02:41:31,889
...I welcome you to these games
in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.

1240
02:41:32,557 --> 02:41:35,142
We dedicate them to his glory...

1241
02:41:35,352 --> 02:41:37,895
...and to the glory of Rome...

1242
02:41:38,105 --> 02:41:40,773
...of which you are all part.

1243
02:41:44,069 --> 02:41:47,279
Let us honor those
who race for us today.

1244
02:41:47,781 --> 02:41:50,324
They come here from Alexandria...

1245
02:41:50,575 --> 02:41:51,742
...Messina...

1246
02:41:51,993 --> 02:41:53,327
...Carthage...

1247
02:41:53,578 --> 02:41:54,787
...Cyprus...

1248
02:41:54,996 --> 02:41:56,163
...Rome...

1249
02:41:56,498 --> 02:41:57,623
...Corinth...

1250
02:41:57,916 --> 02:41:59,250
...Athens...

1251
02:41:59,501 --> 02:42:00,709
...Phrygia...

1252
02:42:00,919 --> 02:42:02,670
...and Judea.

1253
02:42:10,846 --> 02:42:14,098
To the best of these,
a crown of victory.

1254
02:42:14,850 --> 02:42:16,976
The race begins.

1255
02:42:17,602 --> 02:42:19,854
Hail, Caesar!

1256
02:42:20,105 --> 02:42:22,106
Hail, Caesar!

1257
02:43:30,550 --> 02:43:32,384
Oh, you dog!

1258
02:46:23,348 --> 02:46:25,432
Come, my children, come!

1259
02:46:42,450 --> 02:46:44,034
The Roman pig!

1260
02:47:21,781 --> 02:47:23,781
Hyah! Hyah!

1261
02:49:11,266 --> 02:49:13,016
Steady! Now, now!

1262
02:53:16,469 --> 02:53:17,803
Salute.

1263
02:53:32,443 --> 02:53:34,194
A great victory.

1264
02:53:34,403 --> 02:53:37,030
You are the people's one true god...

1265
02:53:37,281 --> 02:53:38,865
...for the time being.

1266
02:53:39,450 --> 02:53:41,201
Permit us to worship.

1267
02:53:49,127 --> 02:53:51,628
I crown their god.

1268
02:54:11,566 --> 02:54:15,360
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.

1269
02:54:16,070 --> 02:54:20,323
A long life, young Arrius,
and the good sense to live it.

1270
02:54:45,433 --> 02:54:47,684
We cannot wait, tribune.

1271
02:54:47,935 --> 02:54:50,228
He will come. He will...

1272
02:54:58,362 --> 02:55:00,447
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.

1273
02:55:00,656 --> 02:55:02,407
He will come!

1274
02:55:05,953 --> 02:55:07,412
He will come.

1275
02:55:08,164 --> 02:55:11,625
I've sent for him, and he will come.

1276
02:55:12,001 --> 02:55:16,213
If you wish us to keep you alive,
we have to go to work now, tribune.

1277
02:55:16,964 --> 02:55:18,298
Do you understand?

1278
02:55:18,507 --> 02:55:20,634
To hack the legs off me?

1279
02:55:20,885 --> 02:55:24,596
Not yet. Not till I've seen him.

1280
02:55:25,181 --> 02:55:27,641
I don't receive him with half a body.

1281
02:55:39,820 --> 02:55:42,739
No. No!

1282
02:55:50,414 --> 02:55:53,458
I told you, Drusus. I told you.

1283
02:55:53,834 --> 02:55:55,460
Here he is.

1284
02:56:29,120 --> 02:56:33,623
Triumph c...
Triumph complete, Judah.

1285
02:56:34,375 --> 02:56:37,460
The race won. The enemy destroyed.

1286
02:56:42,550 --> 02:56:44,634
I see no enemy.

1287
02:56:46,262 --> 02:56:48,096
What do you think you see?

1288
02:56:48,306 --> 02:56:51,224
The smashed body of a wretched animal?

1289
02:56:53,894 --> 02:56:57,647
There's enough of a man
still left here for you to hate.

1290
02:57:02,862 --> 02:57:04,404
Let me help you.

1291
02:57:19,211 --> 02:57:22,505
You think they're dead,
your mother and sister.

1292
02:57:23,382 --> 02:57:26,134
Dead. And the race over.

1293
02:57:28,429 --> 02:57:30,764
It isn't over, Judah.

1294
02:57:31,640 --> 02:57:32,807
They're not dead.

1295
02:57:38,522 --> 02:57:41,122
Where are they?

1296
02:58:02,546 --> 02:58:04,255
Look for them...

1297
02:58:04,548 --> 02:58:08,259
...in the Valley of the Lepers...

1298
02:58:10,262 --> 02:58:12,389
...if you can recognize them.

1299
02:58:28,155 --> 02:58:29,823
It goes on.

1300
02:58:31,242 --> 02:58:33,368
It goes on, Judah.

1301
02:58:35,579 --> 02:58:36,955
The race...

1302
02:58:39,333 --> 02:58:43,753
The race is not over.

1303
03:00:34,907 --> 03:00:36,783
Is there a way down here?

1304
03:00:37,117 --> 03:00:40,245
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.

1305
03:01:29,253 --> 03:01:30,420
Man.

1306
03:01:35,384 --> 03:01:39,262
I'm searching for two women,
a mother and daughter.

1307
03:01:41,807 --> 03:01:44,934
There... There are many women.

1308
03:01:46,562 --> 03:01:48,938
Of the family of Hur.

1309
03:01:50,858 --> 03:01:53,151
We have no names here.

1310
03:02:52,586 --> 03:02:53,628
For them?

1311
03:02:58,967 --> 03:03:01,886
- Why did you tell me they were dead?
- It was what they wanted.

1312
03:03:02,096 --> 03:03:06,224
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?

1313
03:03:06,558 --> 03:03:08,267
Not to see them?

1314
03:03:08,560 --> 03:03:09,686
They are coming.

1315
03:03:09,895 --> 03:03:14,607
Love them in the way they must need
to be loved. Not to look at them.

1316
03:03:14,858 --> 03:03:19,362
Let them be as if you had
never come here. Please! Judah!

1317
03:04:31,935 --> 03:04:33,227
Is Judah well?

1318
03:04:34,563 --> 03:04:36,606
Is he happy?

1319
03:04:37,816 --> 03:04:40,818
Yes, he is well.

1320
03:04:44,072 --> 03:04:46,741
Your mind can be at rest for him.

1321
03:04:47,367 --> 03:04:49,035
He is well, Miriam.

1322
03:04:59,004 --> 03:05:00,505
God be with you.

1323
03:05:36,917 --> 03:05:38,334
They have gone.

1324
03:05:45,259 --> 03:05:46,801
We can go back.

1325
03:05:51,306 --> 03:05:54,016
Go back to what?

1326
03:05:56,436 --> 03:05:58,938
Judah, they have one blessing left.

1327
03:05:59,314 --> 03:06:02,567
To think you remember them
as they were...

1328
03:06:03,902 --> 03:06:05,903
...and live your own life.

1329
03:06:08,615 --> 03:06:10,366
Forget what is here.

1330
03:06:10,576 --> 03:06:11,784
Forget?

1331
03:06:14,746 --> 03:06:16,539
It's as though
they were alive in a grave.

1332
03:06:16,707 --> 03:06:19,417
- But what can you do?
- Undo what you've done.

1333
03:06:19,626 --> 03:06:23,087
How could you have suffered them
to come here? I must see them.

1334
03:06:23,297 --> 03:06:25,840
No, Judah, please! Judah!

1335
03:06:30,178 --> 03:06:34,557
Think, Judah, think. It would
tear them apart if they see you.

1336
03:07:38,705 --> 03:07:39,789
Judah!

1337
03:07:40,958 --> 03:07:42,208
Judah.

1338
03:07:43,043 --> 03:07:46,963
He is here. I have found him.
The child has become a man.

1339
03:07:47,214 --> 03:07:51,467
And the man, I know it now,
is the son of God.

1340
03:07:55,639 --> 03:07:57,431
The promise is true.

1341
03:07:58,684 --> 03:08:02,478
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.

1342
03:08:02,688 --> 03:08:04,772
Life has been answered.

1343
03:08:05,023 --> 03:08:06,899
God has answered it.

1344
03:08:21,957 --> 03:08:23,958
Come. Come with me.

1345
03:08:27,295 --> 03:08:29,755
When the Romans were marching me
to the galleys...

1346
03:08:29,965 --> 03:08:32,049
...thirst had nearly killed me.

1347
03:08:32,259 --> 03:08:35,011
A man gave me water to drink.

1348
03:08:35,262 --> 03:08:36,971
I went on living.

1349
03:08:37,347 --> 03:08:40,725
I should have done better
if I had poured it into the sand.

1350
03:08:41,018 --> 03:08:42,309
No.

1351
03:08:42,769 --> 03:08:44,311
I am thirsty still.

1352
03:08:45,063 --> 03:08:46,897
Come and listen.

1353
03:08:48,900 --> 03:08:50,943
I have business with Rome.

1354
03:08:52,779 --> 03:08:54,822
You insist on death.

1355
03:09:00,037 --> 03:09:01,579
Goodbye, Judah.

1356
03:10:54,818 --> 03:10:55,818
You sent for me?

1357
03:10:56,027 --> 03:10:59,029
I hope I bring you
a good conclusion to your victory.

1358
03:10:59,239 --> 03:11:02,408
I have a message for you
from the consul, your father.

1359
03:11:04,494 --> 03:11:07,580
- I honor him.
- As you may honor yourself.

1360
03:11:07,831 --> 03:11:10,082
You have been made a citizen of Rome.

1361
03:11:13,962 --> 03:11:16,088
Do you say nothing to this?

1362
03:11:18,884 --> 03:11:22,219
I have just come
from the Valley of Stone...

1363
03:11:22,429 --> 03:11:26,348
...where my mother and sister live
what's left of their lives.

1364
03:11:26,516 --> 03:11:31,395
By Rome's will,
lepers, outcasts without hope.

1365
03:11:31,646 --> 03:11:35,983
I have heard this. There was great
blame there, very deeply regretted.

1366
03:11:36,234 --> 03:11:40,905
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.

1367
03:11:41,114 --> 03:11:43,741
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.

1368
03:11:43,950 --> 03:11:47,411
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.

1369
03:11:47,621 --> 03:11:50,497
Before the cruelty of Rome
spread in his blood.

1370
03:11:50,707 --> 03:11:55,127
Rome destroyed Messala as surely
as Rome has destroyed my family.

1371
03:11:55,378 --> 03:11:59,590
Where there is greatness,
great government or power...

1372
03:11:59,799 --> 03:12:02,092
...even great feeling or compassion...

1373
03:12:02,385 --> 03:12:04,803
...error also is great.

1374
03:12:05,013 --> 03:12:07,097
We progress and mature by fault.

1375
03:12:07,307 --> 03:12:10,976
Rome has said she is ready to join
your life to hers in a great future.

1376
03:12:11,269 --> 03:12:12,728
There are other voices.

1377
03:12:12,938 --> 03:12:16,440
The voice, for instance, of Arrius
waiting for you in Rome.

1378
03:12:16,650 --> 03:12:19,151
He would tell you,
if I may speak in his place...

1379
03:12:19,653 --> 03:12:22,821
...not to crucify yourself
on a shadow such as old resentment...

1380
03:12:23,031 --> 03:12:25,157
...or impossible loyalties.

1381
03:12:25,408 --> 03:12:27,701
Perfect freedom has no existence.

1382
03:12:27,911 --> 03:12:30,829
A grown man knows the world
he lives in.

1383
03:12:31,039 --> 03:12:34,500
And for the present, the world is Rome.

1384
03:12:35,543 --> 03:12:37,920
Young Arrius, I am sure,
will choose it.

1385
03:12:40,006 --> 03:12:41,924
I am Judah Ben-Hur.

1386
03:12:54,062 --> 03:12:56,647
I cross this floor
in spoken friendship...

1387
03:12:56,856 --> 03:12:59,066
...as I would speak to Arrius.

1388
03:12:59,526 --> 03:13:03,195
But when I go up those stairs,
I become the hand of Caesar...

1389
03:13:03,446 --> 03:13:05,948
...ready to crush all those
who challenge his authority.

1390
03:13:06,741 --> 03:13:08,951
There are too many small men
of envy and ambition...

1391
03:13:09,160 --> 03:13:11,328
...who try to disrupt
the government of Rome.

1392
03:13:11,538 --> 03:13:14,123
You have become the victor
and hero to those people.

1393
03:13:14,708 --> 03:13:18,836
They look to you,
their one true god, as I called you.

1394
03:13:19,296 --> 03:13:23,257
If you stay here, you will find
yourself part of this tragedy.

1395
03:13:24,217 --> 03:13:27,261
I am already part of this tragedy.

1396
03:13:33,685 --> 03:13:35,769
Return this to Arrius.

1397
03:13:37,314 --> 03:13:39,857
I honor him too well
to wear it any longer.

1398
03:13:49,576 --> 03:13:51,785
Even for Arrius' sake,
I cannot protect you...

1399
03:13:51,995 --> 03:13:54,663
...from personal disaster
if you stay here.

1400
03:13:55,498 --> 03:13:57,541
You are too great a danger.

1401
03:14:13,350 --> 03:14:15,184
Leave Judea.

1402
03:14:17,020 --> 03:14:18,896
You have my word.

1403
03:14:39,959 --> 03:14:41,168
Judah!

1404
03:14:50,637 --> 03:14:52,429
Oh, Judah!

1405
03:14:53,139 --> 03:14:55,557
I was afraid
you would never come back...

1406
03:14:55,767 --> 03:14:58,060
...afraid of what would happen to you.

1407
03:14:59,854 --> 03:15:01,855
But I see you again.

1408
03:15:04,317 --> 03:15:06,860
Your father's waiting for me.

1409
03:15:11,199 --> 03:15:12,408
Where is he?

1410
03:15:15,245 --> 03:15:16,578
What do you mean to do?

1411
03:15:25,130 --> 03:15:26,380
Oh, Judah.

1412
03:15:27,799 --> 03:15:30,008
Rest, sleep.

1413
03:15:30,218 --> 03:15:33,512
For a few hours of the night
let your mind be at peace.

1414
03:15:33,721 --> 03:15:35,097
Peace?

1415
03:15:35,265 --> 03:15:37,224
Love and peace.

1416
03:15:37,434 --> 03:15:40,436
Do you think I don't long for them
as much as you do?

1417
03:15:40,770 --> 03:15:41,895
Where do you see them?

1418
03:15:43,440 --> 03:15:45,482
If you had heard this man
from Nazareth.

1419
03:15:45,692 --> 03:15:46,984
Balthasar's word.

1420
03:15:48,862 --> 03:15:51,447
He is more than Balthasar's word.

1421
03:15:51,990 --> 03:15:55,993
His voice traveled
with such a still purpose.

1422
03:15:56,369 --> 03:15:58,454
It was more than a voice.

1423
03:15:59,372 --> 03:16:01,623
A man more than a man.

1424
03:16:05,295 --> 03:16:09,298
He said, "Blessed are the merciful...

1425
03:16:09,507 --> 03:16:11,800
...for they shall obtain mercy.

1426
03:16:12,677 --> 03:16:14,970
Blessed are the peacemakers...

1427
03:16:15,180 --> 03:16:18,307
...for they shall be called
the children of God."

1428
03:16:18,892 --> 03:16:20,142
Children of God?

1429
03:16:21,186 --> 03:16:24,021
In that dead valley
where we left them?

1430
03:16:24,230 --> 03:16:28,025
I tell you every man of Judea is
unclean and will stay unclean...

1431
03:16:28,276 --> 03:16:31,445
...until we have scoured off
our bodies the crust and filth...

1432
03:16:31,654 --> 03:16:33,864
...of being at the mercy of tyranny.

1433
03:16:34,324 --> 03:16:37,910
No other life is possible
except to wash this land clean.

1434
03:16:38,161 --> 03:16:39,870
- In blood?
- Yes, in blood!

1435
03:16:42,081 --> 03:16:43,916
I know there is a law in life.

1436
03:16:44,167 --> 03:16:48,086
That blood begets more blood
as dog begets dog.

1437
03:16:48,338 --> 03:16:50,422
Death generates death...

1438
03:16:50,673 --> 03:16:53,258
...as the vulture breeds the vulture.

1439
03:16:54,010 --> 03:16:56,595
But the voice I heard today
on the hill said:

1440
03:16:56,804 --> 03:16:58,514
"Love your enemy.

1441
03:16:58,848 --> 03:17:02,017
Do good to those who
despitefully use you."

1442
03:17:02,727 --> 03:17:06,230
All who are born in this land
hereafter can suffer as we have done.

1443
03:17:06,439 --> 03:17:08,732
As you make us do now.

1444
03:17:12,403 --> 03:17:14,780
Are we to bear nothing together?

1445
03:17:16,574 --> 03:17:17,908
Even love?

1446
03:17:21,621 --> 03:17:24,206
I can hardly draw breath...

1447
03:17:24,624 --> 03:17:26,875
...without feeling you in my heart.

1448
03:17:28,211 --> 03:17:29,628
But I know...

1449
03:17:31,339 --> 03:17:33,799
...that everything I do
from this moment...

1450
03:17:34,008 --> 03:17:37,219
...will be as great a pain to you
as you have ever suffered.

1451
03:17:38,555 --> 03:17:40,722
It is better not to love me.

1452
03:17:42,308 --> 03:17:46,853
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?

1453
03:17:47,313 --> 03:17:50,274
You seem to be now the very thing
you set out to destroy...

1454
03:17:50,483 --> 03:17:54,945
...giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.

1455
03:17:55,154 --> 03:17:57,072
It's as though you had become Messala.

1456
03:18:05,790 --> 03:18:07,874
I've lost you, Judah.

1457
03:19:10,480 --> 03:19:12,230
No further.

1458
03:19:13,191 --> 03:19:14,524
What are you doing here?

1459
03:19:15,318 --> 03:19:17,819
I was here last evening
waiting for you.

1460
03:19:18,029 --> 03:19:20,489
I have waited all night.
What has happened?

1461
03:19:21,407 --> 03:19:22,866
Where is Tirzah?

1462
03:19:26,079 --> 03:19:27,871
Leave the food.

1463
03:19:28,998 --> 03:19:31,750
I am coming closer. Don't be afraid.

1464
03:19:31,959 --> 03:19:34,336
- What are you doing?
- Don't be afraid.

1465
03:19:34,754 --> 03:19:37,381
I've heard him again,
the man from Nazareth.

1466
03:19:37,590 --> 03:19:41,968
If ever words were from God,
they are in everything he says.

1467
03:19:42,220 --> 03:19:45,347
I cannot bear that
you should have never known...

1468
03:19:45,515 --> 03:19:49,351
...this hand of quiet
reaching towards us.

1469
03:19:49,769 --> 03:19:52,854
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find him there.

1470
03:19:53,022 --> 03:19:55,440
Bring Tirzah
and we can go together to find him.

1471
03:19:58,361 --> 03:20:00,570
Tirzah is dying.

1472
03:20:06,994 --> 03:20:09,538
Leave the food and go.

1473
03:20:11,749 --> 03:20:13,417
It's Judah.

1474
03:20:17,630 --> 03:20:19,756
Why did you tell him?

1475
03:20:20,550 --> 03:20:22,467
Yes, Judah, yes.

1476
03:20:23,094 --> 03:20:26,304
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.

1477
03:20:26,514 --> 03:20:27,556
Mother.

1478
03:20:30,476 --> 03:20:33,437
Wait, Mother, wait.

1479
03:20:33,646 --> 03:20:34,771
Let me talk with you.

1480
03:20:34,981 --> 03:20:36,398
Please.

1481
03:20:36,607 --> 03:20:39,192
No, no further. Please.

1482
03:20:39,402 --> 03:20:43,113
No, Judah. Son, no.

1483
03:20:43,906 --> 03:20:46,908
Mother, let me see Tirzah.

1484
03:20:47,076 --> 03:20:48,076
Tirzah is dying.

1485
03:20:58,755 --> 03:21:01,965
Judah, if they would see Jesus
of Nazareth they will know...

1486
03:21:02,175 --> 03:21:04,176
...that life is everlasting...

1487
03:21:04,427 --> 03:21:08,054
...and death is nothing to fear
if you have faith.

1488
03:21:10,683 --> 03:21:12,350
I will take them to him.

1489
03:21:14,437 --> 03:21:15,520
No!

1490
03:21:16,439 --> 03:21:17,647
God, no!

1491
03:21:31,704 --> 03:21:34,623
No, no, dear son.

1492
03:21:35,666 --> 03:21:36,875
Mother...

1493
03:21:39,629 --> 03:21:41,171
...where is Tirzah?

1494
03:21:44,383 --> 03:21:48,804
Judah, no.

1495
03:21:57,563 --> 03:22:00,482
You must not go to her, dear son.

1496
03:22:01,859 --> 03:22:03,193
Please.

1497
03:22:03,820 --> 03:22:05,320
Dear son.

1498
03:22:56,622 --> 03:22:58,248
I am afraid.

1499
03:22:59,208 --> 03:23:00,876
No cause.

1500
03:23:02,336 --> 03:23:04,713
The world is more than we know.

1501
03:23:40,917 --> 03:23:44,169
Tirzah, it's Judah.

1502
03:23:44,587 --> 03:23:45,670
No.

1503
03:23:46,714 --> 03:23:48,548
No, Judah.

1504
03:23:50,676 --> 03:23:52,552
No, Judah. No.

1505
03:24:32,218 --> 03:24:34,803
Alms for the blind?

1506
03:24:35,846 --> 03:24:38,515
Alms for the blind?

1507
03:24:41,644 --> 03:24:45,939
Alms for the blind?
Alms for the blind?

1508
03:24:46,148 --> 03:24:49,985
Why are the streets deserted?
- They have gone to the trial.

1509
03:24:50,152 --> 03:24:53,113
- Alms for the blind?
- Trial? Whose trial?

1510
03:24:53,322 --> 03:24:56,616
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.

1511
03:24:56,826 --> 03:24:58,952
- This cannot be true.
- Alms?

1512
03:25:00,371 --> 03:25:01,746
What has he done?

1513
03:25:01,956 --> 03:25:05,667
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.

1514
03:25:05,876 --> 03:25:07,836
Help for the blind.

1515
03:25:08,004 --> 03:25:10,171
Look, lepers!
Lepers!

1516
03:25:10,798 --> 03:25:14,259
Go away!
Get away! Stay away!

1517
03:25:15,553 --> 03:25:16,845
Go away!

1518
03:27:36,318 --> 03:27:38,444
Lepers! Lepers!

1519
03:28:00,009 --> 03:28:02,177
How can this be?

1520
03:28:11,312 --> 03:28:13,646
I know this man.

1521
03:28:27,745 --> 03:28:29,662
Will someone help him?

1522
03:28:37,171 --> 03:28:38,463
Take pity on him.

1523
03:28:44,720 --> 03:28:47,722
Have mercy. Have mercy.

1524
03:29:09,870 --> 03:29:11,746
In his pain...

1525
03:29:12,414 --> 03:29:14,791
...this look of peace.

1526
03:29:16,919 --> 03:29:18,753
Watch over them, Esther.

1527
03:29:56,792 --> 03:29:58,126
We must go back.

1528
03:29:58,294 --> 03:30:00,670
I brought you here to this...

1529
03:30:01,422 --> 03:30:03,131
...when I hoped...

1530
03:30:06,051 --> 03:30:08,428
You haven't failed, Esther.

1531
03:30:26,989 --> 03:30:29,574
Hail King of the Jews!

1532
03:33:07,608 --> 03:33:11,152
This is where your search
has brought you, Balthasar.

1533
03:33:17,951 --> 03:33:19,744
He gave me water...

1534
03:33:20,496 --> 03:33:22,497
...and a heart to live.

1535
03:33:25,501 --> 03:33:27,335
What has he done to merit this?

1536
03:33:29,546 --> 03:33:33,341
He has taken the world
of our sins onto himself.

1537
03:33:34,551 --> 03:33:37,470
To this end he said he was born...

1538
03:33:38,680 --> 03:33:40,640
...in that stable...

1539
03:33:41,350 --> 03:33:43,476
...where I first saw him.

1540
03:33:47,064 --> 03:33:50,399
For this cause,
he came into the world.

1541
03:33:57,199 --> 03:33:58,908
For this death?

1542
03:34:01,703 --> 03:34:03,204
This beginning.

1543
03:34:35,737 --> 03:34:37,863
I have lived too long.

1544
03:35:08,937 --> 03:35:12,064
As though he were carrying
in that cross...

1545
03:35:12,274 --> 03:35:14,442
...the pain of the world.

1546
03:35:15,944 --> 03:35:20,448
So fearful, and yet why is it...

1547
03:35:20,657 --> 03:35:22,950
...I'm not afraid anymore?

1548
03:35:32,252 --> 03:35:34,587
The shadow of a storm.

1549
03:36:00,155 --> 03:36:02,448
A strange darkness...

1550
03:36:02,658 --> 03:36:04,617
...but still day.

1551
03:36:13,543 --> 03:36:15,795
His life is over.

1552
03:36:37,025 --> 03:36:38,359
What is it?

1553
03:36:47,452 --> 03:36:49,036
This tearing.

1554
03:36:49,996 --> 03:36:51,872
I am in pain.

1555
03:36:52,833 --> 03:36:54,875
I feel it too.

1556
03:37:25,282 --> 03:37:26,365
Miriam.

1557
03:37:31,413 --> 03:37:33,164
I thought I...

1558
03:37:34,583 --> 03:37:35,583
Miriam.

1559
03:37:39,755 --> 03:37:41,547
Do you see your hand?

1560
03:37:44,926 --> 03:37:46,010
Tirzah.

1561
03:37:49,639 --> 03:37:50,723
Miriam.

1562
03:38:02,819 --> 03:38:03,903
Tirzah.

1563
03:40:19,956 --> 03:40:22,416
Almost at the moment he died...

1564
03:40:23,919 --> 03:40:27,421
...I heard him say,
"Father, forgive them...

1565
03:40:27,672 --> 03:40:29,965
...for they know not what they do."

1566
03:40:32,218 --> 03:40:35,429
- Even then.
- Even then.

1567
03:40:41,102 --> 03:40:45,606
And I felt his voice take
the sword out of my hand.
