2
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:46,262
I'm Jerry Lundegaard.

3
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:48,556
You're Jerry Lundegaard?

4
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,724
Yeah.

5
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:51,017
Shep Proudfoot said...

6
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:54,270
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30.
What gives, man?

7
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:56,105
Shep said 8:30.

8
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:57,529
We've been sitting here an hour.

9
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,108
He's peed three times already.

10
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:02,194
I'm sure sorry.
Shep told me 8:30.

11
00:04:02,404 --> 00:04:04,447
It was a mix-up, I guess.

12
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:05,781
You got the car?

13
00:04:05,908 --> 00:04:07,116
Yeah.
You bet.

14
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,827
It's out in the lot there,
brand-new, burnt umber Cierra.

15
00:04:09,912 --> 00:04:12,371
Yeah, okay.
Well, sit down, then.

16
00:04:13,248 --> 00:04:14,290
I'm Carl Showalter.

17
00:04:14,374 --> 00:04:16,584
This is my associate, Gaear Grimsrud.

18
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:18,085
Yeah.
How you doing?

19
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,630
So, we all set on this thing, then?

20
00:04:20,714 --> 00:04:22,555
Sure, Jerry. We're all set.
Why wouldn't we be?

21
00:04:22,591 --> 00:04:23,966
Yeah, no, I'm sure you are.

22
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:25,384
Shep vouched for you and all.

23
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:28,304
I got every confidence here in you fellas.

24
00:04:33,226 --> 00:04:35,269
I guess that's it, then.

25
00:04:35,354 --> 00:04:36,395
Here are the keys.

26
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,772
No, that's not it, Jerry.

27
00:04:38,982 --> 00:04:41,359
The new vehicle plus $40,000.

28
00:04:41,443 --> 00:04:44,028
Yeah, but the deal was the car first,

29
00:04:44,112 --> 00:04:47,406
then the 40,000, like as
if it was the ransom.

30
00:04:47,491 --> 00:04:48,574
I thought Shep told you.

31
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:50,201
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.

32
00:04:50,285 --> 00:04:51,327
Well, okay...

33
00:04:51,411 --> 00:04:53,579
Except that you were
gonna be here at 7:30.

34
00:04:53,664 --> 00:04:55,247
Yeah, well, that was a mix-up, then.

35
00:04:55,332 --> 00:04:56,832
Yeah, you already said that.

36
00:04:56,917 --> 00:05:00,503
Yeah, but it's not a whole
pay-in-advance deal.

37
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:04,757
See, I give you a brand-new
vehicle in advance, and then...

38
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:06,342
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.

39
00:05:06,426 --> 00:05:07,426
Okay.

40
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:09,595
I'm not gonna sit here and debate.

41
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,721
I will say this, though.

42
00:05:10,806 --> 00:05:13,474
What Shep told us didn't
make a whole lot of sense.

43
00:05:13,558 --> 00:05:16,602
Oh, no. It's real sound.
It's all worked out.

44
00:05:17,312 --> 00:05:19,271
You want your own wife kidnapped.

45
00:05:19,356 --> 00:05:20,398
Yeah.

46
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:23,442
You...

47
00:05:23,986 --> 00:05:25,403
My point is,

48
00:05:25,862 --> 00:05:28,322
you pay the ransom, what, 80,000 bucks?

49
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:32,284
I mean, you give us half the
ransom, 40,000, you keep half.

50
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:33,861
It's like robbing Peter to pay Paul.

51
00:05:33,945 --> 00:05:35,054
It doesn't make any sense.

52
00:05:35,138 --> 00:05:38,349
Okay, see, it's not me paying the ransom.

53
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:41,210
The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy.

54
00:05:41,294 --> 00:05:43,004
Her dad, he's real well-off.

55
00:05:43,088 --> 00:05:44,463
Now, I'm in a bit of trouble.

56
00:05:44,548 --> 00:05:46,207
What kind of trouble you in, Jerry?

57
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:49,844
Well, that's...
I'm not gonna get into...

58
00:05:49,928 --> 00:05:51,345
See, I just need the money.

59
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,556
Now, her dad, he's real well-off.

60
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,400
So, why don't you just
ask him for the money?

61
00:05:55,434 --> 00:05:56,809
Or your fucking wife, you know?

62
00:05:56,893 --> 00:05:58,310
Or your fucking wife, Jerry?

63
00:05:58,395 --> 00:05:59,603
Well...

64
00:06:00,397 --> 00:06:02,440
It's all part of this...

65
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:06,110
They don't know I need it, see?

66
00:06:06,194 --> 00:06:09,405
Okay, so there's that.
And even if they did, I wouldn't get it,

67
00:06:09,489 --> 00:06:10,990
so there's that on top, then.

68
00:06:11,074 --> 00:06:12,354
See, these are personal matters.

69
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:13,409
Personal matters?

70
00:06:13,493 --> 00:06:16,412
Yeah, personal matters that needn't...

71
00:06:16,663 --> 00:06:18,414
Okay, Jerry.

72
00:06:18,498 --> 00:06:22,501
You're tasking us to perform
this mission, but you won't...

73
00:06:22,586 --> 00:06:24,086
You won't...

74
00:06:26,423 --> 00:06:28,883
Fuck it.
Let's take a look at that Cierra.

75
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:38,100
Hon?

76
00:06:38,643 --> 00:06:40,853
Hi, hon!
Welcome back!

77
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:42,772
How was Fargo?

78
00:06:42,856 --> 00:06:44,523
Yeah, real good.

79
00:06:44,775 --> 00:06:46,275
Dad's here.

80
00:06:48,945 --> 00:06:51,822
...leads the Badgers in
goal production with five this year.

81
00:06:52,032 --> 00:06:53,032
How you doing, Wade?

82
00:06:53,116 --> 00:06:54,200
Yeah, pretty good.

83
00:06:54,284 --> 00:06:55,284
What you watching there?

84
00:06:55,368 --> 00:06:56,410
Gophers.

85
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:57,870
Who they playing?

86
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,338
Is he staying for supper, then?

87
00:07:07,422 --> 00:07:09,131
Yeah.
I think so.

88
00:07:09,674 --> 00:07:10,841
- Dad?
- What?

89
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:12,218
Are you staying for supper?

90
00:07:12,302 --> 00:07:13,427
Yeah.

91
00:07:20,602 --> 00:07:22,144
May I be excused?

92
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:23,229
You done there?

93
00:07:23,313 --> 00:07:24,730
I'm going out.

94
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:26,565
Where are you going?
Just out.

95
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,817
Just McDonald's.

96
00:07:27,901 --> 00:07:29,568
Back at 9:30.
Okay.

97
00:07:30,612 --> 00:07:32,404
He just ate.
He didn't finish.

98
00:07:32,489 --> 00:07:35,074
Going to McDonald's
instead of finishing here.

99
00:07:35,158 --> 00:07:36,659
He sees his friends there.
It's okay.

100
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:38,410
It's okay, McDonald's?

101
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,287
What do you think they do there?

102
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:42,414
They don't drink milk shakes, I assure you.

103
00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:43,999
It's okay, Dad.

104
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:53,425
Wade, have you had a chance to think about

105
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,010
that deal I was talking about,

106
00:07:55,095 --> 00:07:56,762
those 40 acres there, in Wayzata?

107
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,264
You told me about it.

108
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:00,266
Yeah, you said you'd
have to think about it.

109
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,767
I understand.
It's a lot of money.

110
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:04,770
It's a heck of a lot. What did you
say you were gonna put there?

111
00:08:04,855 --> 00:08:06,147
A lot.
It's a...

112
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:07,690
I know it's a lot.

113
00:08:07,774 --> 00:08:08,941
I mean a parking lot.

114
00:08:09,025 --> 00:08:12,027
Well, 750,000 is a lot.

115
00:08:12,737 --> 00:08:14,017
Yeah, well, it's a chunk, but...

116
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,074
I had a couple lots, late 50s.
Lost a lot of money.

117
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:18,839
A lot of money.
Yeah, but the difference...

118
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:21,036
I thought you were gonna
show it to Stan Grossman.

119
00:08:21,121 --> 00:08:23,372
He passes on this stuff before
it gets kicked up to me.

120
00:08:23,456 --> 00:08:26,000
Well, Stan'll say, "No dice."
That's why you pay him.

121
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:28,085
I'm asking you here, Wade.

122
00:08:28,837 --> 00:08:32,381
This could work out real good
for me and Jean and Scotty.

123
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:35,259
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.

124
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:52,067
Where is Pancakes House?

125
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,320
What?

126
00:08:54,404 --> 00:08:56,530
We stop at Pancakes House.

127
00:08:57,949 --> 00:09:00,326
What are you, nuts?
We had pancakes for breakfast.

128
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,150
Gotta go to a place where I can get a shot

129
00:09:02,178 --> 00:09:03,662
and a beer and a steak, maybe.

130
00:09:03,747 --> 00:09:06,165
Not more fucking pancakes.
Come on.

131
00:09:11,171 --> 00:09:13,172
Come on, man.

132
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:16,508
Okay.
Here's an idea.

133
00:09:17,052 --> 00:09:18,332
We can stop outside of Brainerd.

134
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:20,845
I know a place there where we can get laid.
What do you think?

135
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:22,681
I'm fucking hungry now, you know.

136
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:26,435
Yeah, yeah, Jesus.
I'm saying we can stop, get pancakes,

137
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,938
and then we'll get laid, all right?

138
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,198
Lou Diamond, line one.

139
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,285
We sat right here in this room

140
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,828
and went over this and over this.

141
00:09:44,913 --> 00:09:45,955
Yeah, but that TruCoat...

142
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:48,958
I sat right here and said I
didn't want any TruCoat.

143
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:51,043
Yeah, but I'm saying that TruCoat.

144
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:53,128
You don't get it,
you get oxidation problems.

145
00:09:53,213 --> 00:09:55,113
It'll cost you a heck of
a lot more than $500.

146
00:09:55,198 --> 00:09:56,081
You're sitting there.

147
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,207
You're talking in circles.

148
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:59,326
You're talking like we
didn't go over this already.

149
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,494
Yeah, but this TruCoat...

150
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:02,304
We had a deal here for 19,500.

151
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:04,198
You sat there and darned
if you didn't tell me

152
00:10:04,282 --> 00:10:05,891
you'd get me this car, these options,

153
00:10:05,976 --> 00:10:07,893
without the sealant, for 19,500.

154
00:10:07,978 --> 00:10:09,436
All right, I'm not saying I didn't.

155
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:11,063
You called me 20 minutes ago and said

156
00:10:11,147 --> 00:10:12,856
you had it ready to make delivery.

157
00:10:12,941 --> 00:10:14,566
You says, "Come on down and get it."

158
00:10:14,651 --> 00:10:18,779
And here you are, and you're wasting
my time and my wife's time,

159
00:10:18,863 --> 00:10:21,782
and I'm paying 19,500
for this vehicle here.

160
00:10:22,492 --> 00:10:23,867
All right.

161
00:10:24,619 --> 00:10:26,495
I'll talk to my boss.

162
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,959
See, they install that
TruCoat at the factory.

163
00:10:32,043 --> 00:10:35,462
There's nothing we can do,
but I'll talk to my boss.

164
00:10:36,673 --> 00:10:38,799
These guys here.
These guys.

165
00:10:40,135 --> 00:10:42,678
It's always the same.
It's always more.

166
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:48,642
You going to the Gophers on Sunday?

167
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:50,227
You betcha.

168
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:52,688
You wouldn't have an extra ticket?

169
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,149
You kidding?

170
00:10:57,027 --> 00:10:58,068
Well,

171
00:11:00,947 --> 00:11:02,614
he never done this before,

172
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:05,451
but seeing as it's special
circumstances and all,

173
00:11:05,535 --> 00:11:08,454
he says I can knock $100 off that TruCoat.

174
00:11:10,206 --> 00:11:11,582
100?

175
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,626
You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard.

176
00:11:14,711 --> 00:11:16,462
You're a bald-faced liar.

177
00:11:16,546 --> 00:11:18,172
Bucky, please.

178
00:11:18,256 --> 00:11:20,841
A fucking liar.

179
00:11:20,925 --> 00:11:22,426
Bucky, please.

180
00:11:23,386 --> 00:11:25,054
Where's my goddamn checkbook?

181
00:11:25,138 --> 00:11:26,764
Let's get this over with.

182
00:11:28,016 --> 00:11:29,391
Where is it?

183
00:12:04,427 --> 00:12:08,597
From Hollywood,
The Tonight Show, starring...

184
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,018
I am talking about your potential.

185
00:12:14,687 --> 00:12:16,814
You're not a C student.

186
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,232
Yeah.

187
00:12:18,525 --> 00:12:20,651
Yet you're getting C grades.

188
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:24,029
It's that disparity there that
concerns your dad and me.

189
00:12:25,865 --> 00:12:27,533
You know what a disparity is?

190
00:12:27,617 --> 00:12:28,659
Yeah!

191
00:12:28,743 --> 00:12:30,869
Okay!
Well, that's why we...

192
00:12:30,954 --> 00:12:33,247
We don't want you going out for hockey.

193
00:12:33,331 --> 00:12:34,665
Oh, man!

194
00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:36,709
Come on. What's the big deal?
It's just an hour...

195
00:12:36,793 --> 00:12:38,544
Hold on.

196
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:39,878
What's the big deal?

197
00:12:39,963 --> 00:12:41,046
Hello?

198
00:12:41,131 --> 00:12:42,923
Yeah, hiya, hon.
Hi, Dad.

199
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:44,091
Is Jerry around?

200
00:12:44,175 --> 00:12:46,051
Yeah. Hon!
Yeah, he's here.

201
00:12:46,136 --> 00:12:47,386
Yeah, I'll catch him for you.

202
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,595
- Hon!
- Yeah?

203
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,264
It's Dad.
Okay.

204
00:12:50,348 --> 00:12:52,307
Look, Dad, there's no fucking way...

205
00:12:52,392 --> 00:12:53,392
Scotty!

206
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:55,811
Hey, let's watch that language there.

207
00:12:55,895 --> 00:12:57,062
How you doing there, Wade?

208
00:12:57,147 --> 00:12:58,230
What's going on there?

209
00:12:58,314 --> 00:13:00,691
Nothing, Wade.
How you doing there?

210
00:13:00,775 --> 00:13:02,818
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal.

211
00:13:02,902 --> 00:13:04,194
He says it's pretty sweet.

212
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,279
No kidding?

213
00:13:05,363 --> 00:13:06,572
Might be interested.

214
00:13:07,073 --> 00:13:10,993
No kidding?
I'd need the cash pretty quick there,

215
00:13:11,077 --> 00:13:12,578
in order to close the deal.

216
00:13:12,662 --> 00:13:14,288
Come by at 2:30.
We'll talk about it.

217
00:13:14,372 --> 00:13:17,416
If your numbers are right,
Stan says it's pretty sweet.

218
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,334
Stan, you know, Grossman.
Yeah.

219
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:20,419
2:30.

220
00:13:20,503 --> 00:13:21,628
Yeah.
Okay.

221
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:38,270
Say, Shep, how you doing there?

222
00:13:38,354 --> 00:13:40,272
Say, you know those two fellas

223
00:13:40,356 --> 00:13:42,136
you put me in touch with up there in Fargo?

224
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,775
I put you in touch with Grimsrud.

225
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,569
Yeah, well, he had a buddy there.

226
00:13:45,653 --> 00:13:47,020
He...
Then I don't vouch for him.

227
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:47,988
Well, that's okay.

228
00:13:48,072 --> 00:13:50,282
I vouch for Grimsrud.
Who's his buddy?

229
00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:51,950
Carl something.

230
00:13:52,035 --> 00:13:53,652
Never heard of him.
Don't vouch for him.

231
00:13:53,736 --> 00:13:56,497
Well, that's okay.
He's a buddy of the guy you vouched for,

232
00:13:56,581 --> 00:13:57,998
so I'm not worried.
I just...

233
00:13:58,082 --> 00:14:00,501
I was wondering, see, I got
to get in touch with him.

234
00:14:00,585 --> 00:14:04,505
See, this deal I needed him
for, I may not need it anymore.

235
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:06,548
Something's happening, see.
Call him up.

236
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:10,052
Yeah, well, see, I did that, and
I haven't been able to get him,

237
00:14:10,136 --> 00:14:13,305
so I thought maybe you'd know an
alternate number, or what have you.

238
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:14,389
Nope.

239
00:14:14,474 --> 00:14:16,308
Okay.
Well...

240
00:14:16,392 --> 00:14:17,893
Real good, then.

241
00:14:37,872 --> 00:14:40,582
Can you crack a fucking window open, man?

242
00:14:42,418 --> 00:14:46,421
You know, it's proven
that secondhand smoke is...

243
00:14:46,506 --> 00:14:48,507
You know, a cancer agent.

244
00:14:50,218 --> 00:14:52,427
Hey, look at that.
Twin Cities.

245
00:14:52,512 --> 00:14:54,296
That's the IDS Building, the big glass one.

246
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:59,126
Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest
after the Sears in Chicago,

247
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,937
or John Hancock building, whatever.

248
00:15:02,021 --> 00:15:04,565
You ever been to Minneapolis?

249
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:05,774
No.

250
00:15:08,403 --> 00:15:10,862
Would it kill you to say something?

251
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:12,698
I did.

252
00:15:13,116 --> 00:15:17,119
"No." That's the first thing you've
said in the last four hours.

253
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,954
That's a...

254
00:15:19,038 --> 00:15:21,623
That's a fountain of conversation, man.

255
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,375
That's a geyser.

256
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,253
I mean... daddy.
Stand back, man.

257
00:15:27,714 --> 00:15:29,214
Shit.

258
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:31,049
I'm sitting here driving.

259
00:15:31,134 --> 00:15:32,509
I'm doing all the driving, man,

260
00:15:32,594 --> 00:15:34,303
whole fucking way from Brainerd, driving.

261
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:37,097
Just trying to chat.

262
00:15:37,348 --> 00:15:39,766
You know, keep our spirits up,

263
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:41,111
fight the boredom of the road,

264
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:45,288
and you can't say one fucking thing
just in the way of conversation?

265
00:15:46,608 --> 00:15:49,318
Fuck it.
I don't have to talk either, man.

266
00:15:49,402 --> 00:15:51,194
See how you like it.

267
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:56,992
Just total fucking silence.

268
00:15:57,076 --> 00:15:59,453
Two could play at that game, smart guy.

269
00:15:59,537 --> 00:16:01,830
We'll just see how you like it.

270
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:05,876
Total silence.

271
00:16:08,296 --> 00:16:11,548
Mr. Lundegaard, this is
Reilly Diefenbach from GMAC.

272
00:16:11,633 --> 00:16:12,758
How are you this morning?

273
00:16:12,842 --> 00:16:14,134
Real good.
How you doing?

274
00:16:14,218 --> 00:16:15,636
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.

275
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,763
You're damn hard to get on the phone.

276
00:16:17,847 --> 00:16:20,265
It's pretty darn busy here, but
that's the way we like it.

277
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,391
Well, that's for sure.

278
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:23,393
Now, I just need on these last,

279
00:16:23,478 --> 00:16:25,520
these financing documents that you sent us,

280
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:27,773
I can't read the serial
numbers of the vehicles.

281
00:16:27,857 --> 00:16:29,149
Yeah, but I already got the...

282
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:30,651
It's okay.
The loans are in place.

283
00:16:30,735 --> 00:16:32,486
I already got the...
What? The...

284
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,820
Yeah, the 320,000.

285
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:35,364
You got the money last month.

286
00:16:35,448 --> 00:16:36,823
Yeah, so we're all set, then.

287
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:39,117
Yeah, but the vehicles
that you're borrowing on,

288
00:16:39,202 --> 00:16:42,120
I just can't read the serial
numbers on your application.

289
00:16:42,205 --> 00:16:43,445
Maybe if you could just read...

290
00:16:43,456 --> 00:16:44,898
Yeah, but the deal's already done.

291
00:16:44,982 --> 00:16:46,007
I already got the money.

292
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:47,550
Yes, but if we have an audit here,

293
00:16:47,635 --> 00:16:49,210
I just have to know that these vehicles

294
00:16:49,295 --> 00:16:50,628
you're financing with this money,

295
00:16:50,713 --> 00:16:51,705
that they really exist.

296
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:53,799
Yeah, well, they exist, all right.

297
00:16:53,883 --> 00:16:55,550
I'm sure they do,

298
00:16:55,635 --> 00:16:59,012
but I can't read the serial numbers
here, so if you could read me...

299
00:16:59,097 --> 00:17:02,057
Yeah, but...
See...

300
00:17:02,642 --> 00:17:03,963
I don't have them in front of me.

301
00:17:04,018 --> 00:17:05,498
Why don't I just fax you over a copy?

302
00:17:05,561 --> 00:17:07,145
No, well, no, fax is no good.

303
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,270
That's what I have,
and I can't read the darn thing.

304
00:17:09,315 --> 00:17:12,067
Yeah, okay.
I'll have my girl send you a copy, then.

305
00:17:12,151 --> 00:17:15,487
Okay, because if I can't correlate
this note with the specific vehicles,

306
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:17,614
then I got to call back that money.

307
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:19,074
Yeah, how much money was that?

308
00:17:19,158 --> 00:17:22,077
320,000.
I got to correlate that money

309
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:23,620
with the cars it's being lent on.

310
00:17:23,705 --> 00:17:25,831
Yeah. Okay, no problem.
I'll just fax that right over.

311
00:17:25,915 --> 00:17:26,873
No, no, no.
Fax...

312
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,350
I mean, send it over.
I'll shoot it right over to you, then.

313
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:30,160
Okay, okay.
Fine.

314
00:17:30,244 --> 00:17:32,120
Okay.
Real good, then.

315
00:17:38,428 --> 00:17:40,262
We're back with Katie Carlson.
Hi.

316
00:17:40,346 --> 00:17:41,588
Now, before we get going here,

317
00:17:41,672 --> 00:17:43,673
we just want to remind all
of our viewers at home

318
00:17:43,758 --> 00:17:45,642
that this March, for the
second year in a row,

319
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,019
Katie and I, along with Twin City Travel,

320
00:17:48,104 --> 00:17:50,689
will be leading a two-week
riverboat trip down the Nile.

321
00:17:50,773 --> 00:17:52,866
It's a terrific time.
I know you've heard about it.

322
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,202
We want all of you to come with,

323
00:17:56,404 --> 00:17:57,612
and that's the truth.

324
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,324
Okay, now, for those of
you that just joined us,

325
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:03,268
Katie here, this morning,
is going to show us

326
00:18:03,352 --> 00:18:06,037
how to make Holidazzle
eggs ourselves, at home.

327
00:18:06,122 --> 00:18:07,956
Now, Katie, I gotta admit...
What?

328
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,542
I was a little bit surprised
when I first picked this up.

329
00:18:10,626 --> 00:18:11,585
Right.

330
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:12,711
This is an empty egg.

331
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:14,004
That's right, Dale.

332
00:18:14,088 --> 00:18:15,388
Well, how do you get the egg...

333
00:18:15,431 --> 00:18:16,981
There was an egg in here, right?
Yeah.

334
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:19,401
Okay, well, I don't... How do you...
I mean, you don't have

335
00:18:19,485 --> 00:18:22,345
an empty chicken somewhere
that lays empty eggs?

336
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,472
No, no.

337
00:18:23,806 --> 00:18:26,141
I guarantee, this was
an honest-to-goodness...

338
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:42,407
Unguent.

339
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:43,492
What?

340
00:18:43,576 --> 00:18:45,327
I need unguent.

341
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:52,918
No.

342
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,052
No...

343
00:19:25,326 --> 00:19:26,535
You want to do it?

344
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:27,828
Push.

345
00:20:27,597 --> 00:20:29,848
How are you, Stan?
How you doing, Wade?

346
00:20:29,932 --> 00:20:31,850
Good to see you again, Jerry.

347
00:20:31,976 --> 00:20:34,519
If these numbers are right,
this looks pretty sweet.

348
00:20:34,604 --> 00:20:36,021
Those numbers are right, all right.

349
00:20:36,105 --> 00:20:37,147
Believe me.

350
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:38,356
This is doable.

351
00:20:38,441 --> 00:20:39,691
Congratulations, Jer.

352
00:20:39,775 --> 00:20:41,651
Yeah, thanks, Stan.
Well, it's a pretty...

353
00:20:41,736 --> 00:20:44,821
What kind of finder's fee
were you looking for?

354
00:20:47,116 --> 00:20:49,451
The financials are pretty thorough,

355
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:52,412
so the only thing
we don't know is your fee.

356
00:20:52,496 --> 00:20:53,872
My fee?

357
00:20:54,582 --> 00:20:56,541
Wade, what the heck are you talking about?

358
00:20:56,626 --> 00:20:58,001
Stan and I are okay.

359
00:20:58,085 --> 00:20:59,920
Yeah.
We're good to load in.

360
00:21:00,004 --> 00:21:01,421
Yeah.

361
00:21:01,505 --> 00:21:05,133
But we never talked about your
fee for bringing it to us.

362
00:21:05,217 --> 00:21:07,552
No, but, Wade, see,
I was bringing you this deal

363
00:21:07,637 --> 00:21:09,254
for you to loan me the money to put in.

364
00:21:09,338 --> 00:21:11,214
It's my deal here, see.

365
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:15,352
Jerry, we thought you were
bringing us an investment.

366
00:21:15,436 --> 00:21:16,645
Yeah.
Right.

367
00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:18,605
You're saying...

368
00:21:19,273 --> 00:21:20,273
What are you saying?

369
00:21:20,358 --> 00:21:21,908
You're saying we put in all the money,

370
00:21:21,992 --> 00:21:23,409
and you collect when it pays off.

371
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:27,697
No, no.
See... But I'd...

372
00:21:27,782 --> 00:21:30,408
I'd pay you back the
principal and interest.

373
00:21:30,493 --> 00:21:33,161
Heck, I'd go one over prime?

374
00:21:33,496 --> 00:21:34,663
We're not a bank, Jerry.

375
00:21:34,747 --> 00:21:36,790
If I wanted bank interest on 750,000,

376
00:21:36,874 --> 00:21:39,876
I'd go to Midwest Federal,
talk to old Bill Diehl.

377
00:21:39,961 --> 00:21:41,294
He's at North Star.
He's at...

378
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:43,338
No, no.
See, I...

379
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,217
I don't need a finder's fee.
I need...

380
00:21:47,885 --> 00:21:49,844
Finder's fee is, what, 10%?

381
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:51,388
Heck, that's not gonna do it for me.

382
00:21:51,472 --> 00:21:52,597
I need the principal.

383
00:21:52,682 --> 00:21:55,934
Well, Jerry, we're not gonna
just give you $750,000.

384
00:21:56,018 --> 00:21:57,435
What the heck were you thinking?

385
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,881
If I'm only getting bank interest,

386
00:21:58,896 --> 00:22:01,690
I want complete security.
Heck, FDIC.

387
00:22:01,774 --> 00:22:03,233
I don't see nothing like that here.

388
00:22:03,317 --> 00:22:04,859
Yeah, but I...

389
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,747
Okay.

390
00:22:09,031 --> 00:22:10,782
I guarantee you your money back.

391
00:22:10,866 --> 00:22:14,077
I'm not talking about
your damn word, Jerry.

392
00:22:14,161 --> 00:22:15,370
Jeez!
What the heck are you...

393
00:22:15,454 --> 00:22:17,163
We're not a bank, Jerry.

394
00:22:17,707 --> 00:22:20,208
Well, look.
I don't want to cut you out of the loop,

395
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:22,669
but this here's a good deal.

396
00:22:22,878 --> 00:22:25,088
I assume, if you're not interested,

397
00:22:25,172 --> 00:22:28,550
you won't mind if we move
on it independently.

398
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,779
Damn it!

399
00:24:02,144 --> 00:24:03,269
Hon?

400
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,732
I got the groceries!

401
00:24:44,311 --> 00:24:47,689
Yeah, Wade, hi.
It's Jerry. I...

402
00:24:49,942 --> 00:24:53,695
Wade, it's Jerry.
I don't know what to do. It's Jean.

403
00:24:53,779 --> 00:24:56,406
I don't know what to do.
It's my wife.

404
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,950
I don't know what to do.
It's Jean.

405
00:25:00,995 --> 00:25:04,164
Yeah, Wade, I...
It's Jerry. I...

406
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:08,960
Wade, it's Jerry.
I... We gotta talk.

407
00:25:09,044 --> 00:25:11,963
It's something...
Jeez. It's terrible.

408
00:25:22,308 --> 00:25:24,434
Yeah, Wade Gustafson, please.

409
00:26:00,304 --> 00:26:02,388
Shut the fuck up,

410
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:05,099
or I'll throw you back
into the trunk, you know.

411
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:08,436
Jesus, that's more than
I've heard you say all week.

412
00:26:16,111 --> 00:26:18,071
Shit.

413
00:26:20,407 --> 00:26:21,908
The tags.

414
00:26:27,248 --> 00:26:29,624
All right, it's just the tags.

415
00:26:29,708 --> 00:26:31,960
I never put my tags on the car.

416
00:26:33,963 --> 00:26:37,006
All right, don't worry.
I'll take care of this.

417
00:27:00,572 --> 00:27:02,440
All right, just keep it
still back there, lady,

418
00:27:02,524 --> 00:27:05,985
or else we're gonna have to,
you know, to shoot you.

419
00:27:13,794 --> 00:27:16,087
Hey, I'll take care of this.

420
00:27:39,403 --> 00:27:41,529
How can I help you, Officer?

421
00:27:51,332 --> 00:27:52,999
This is a new car, then, sir?

422
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:56,085
It certainly is, Officer.
Still got that smell.

423
00:27:57,212 --> 00:27:59,630
You're required to display temporary tags,

424
00:27:59,715 --> 00:28:02,356
either in the plate area or taped
to the inside of the back window.

425
00:28:02,426 --> 00:28:03,468
Certainly.

426
00:28:03,552 --> 00:28:05,928
Can I see your license
and registration, please?

427
00:28:06,013 --> 00:28:07,388
Certainly.

428
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:13,269
Yeah, I was gonna tape up those...
The tag.

429
00:28:13,729 --> 00:28:17,982
You know, to be in full
compliance, but it must have...

430
00:28:18,067 --> 00:28:20,151
It must have slipped my mind.

431
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,162
So maybe the best thing to do would be

432
00:28:23,246 --> 00:28:25,706
to take care of that
right here in Brainerd.

433
00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:28,618
What's this, sir?

434
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:31,496
My license and registration.

435
00:28:32,581 --> 00:28:34,957
Yeah, I want to be in compliance.

436
00:28:36,794 --> 00:28:39,504
I was just thinking we could
take care of it right here,

437
00:28:39,588 --> 00:28:41,047
in Brainerd.

438
00:28:46,887 --> 00:28:50,056
Put that back in your pocket, please,

439
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,725
and step out of the car, please, sir.

440
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,376
Shut the fuck up.

441
00:29:38,897 --> 00:29:40,356
Daddy.

442
00:29:42,985 --> 00:29:45,319
You'll take care of it.

443
00:29:49,158 --> 00:29:51,576
You are smooth, smooth, you know?

444
00:29:53,328 --> 00:29:55,037
Oh, daddy.

445
00:29:56,999 --> 00:29:59,041
Just clear him off the road.

446
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,085
Yeah.

447
00:31:55,117 --> 00:31:56,325
No!

448
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:54,026
Oh, jeez.

449
00:33:59,866 --> 00:34:01,367
Hi.
It's Marge.

450
00:34:03,286 --> 00:34:04,829
Oh, my.
Where?

451
00:34:05,872 --> 00:34:06,997
Yeah?

452
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:09,709
Oh, jeez.

453
00:34:11,962 --> 00:34:13,754
Okay.
There in a jiff.

454
00:34:14,256 --> 00:34:15,881
Real good, then.

455
00:34:24,433 --> 00:34:26,726
You can sleep.
It's early yet.

456
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:28,227
Got to go?

457
00:34:28,311 --> 00:34:29,478
Yeah.

458
00:34:30,397 --> 00:34:32,273
I'll fix you some eggs.

459
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:34,900
It's okay, hon.
I gotta run.

460
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:37,445
You got to eat a breakfast, Marge.

461
00:34:39,364 --> 00:34:41,282
I'll fix you some eggs.

462
00:34:42,325 --> 00:34:44,243
Hon, you can sleep.

463
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:46,662
You gotta eat a breakfast.

464
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:52,084
I'll fix you some eggs.

465
00:34:53,253 --> 00:34:54,378
Norm.

466
00:35:01,303 --> 00:35:03,471
Thanks, hon.
Time to shove off.

467
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:05,222
Love you, Margie.

468
00:35:05,307 --> 00:35:06,599
Love you, hon.

469
00:35:39,758 --> 00:35:40,758
Hon?

470
00:35:40,842 --> 00:35:41,801
Yeah?

471
00:35:41,885 --> 00:35:43,677
Prowler needs a jump.

472
00:36:03,448 --> 00:36:04,824
Hiya, Lou.

473
00:36:05,951 --> 00:36:08,327
What you got there?

474
00:36:08,453 --> 00:36:11,455
Margie, thought you might
need a little warm-up.

475
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,290
Thanks a bunch.

476
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:14,625
So what's the deal now?

477
00:36:14,709 --> 00:36:15,960
Gary says triple homicide?

478
00:36:16,044 --> 00:36:17,294
Yeah, looks pretty bad.

479
00:36:17,379 --> 00:36:19,004
Two of them are over here.

480
00:36:19,422 --> 00:36:20,965
Where is everybody?

481
00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:23,884
Well, it's cold, Margie.

482
00:36:26,096 --> 00:36:28,138
Watch your step, Margie.

483
00:36:37,941 --> 00:36:39,900
Jeez.
So...

484
00:36:40,527 --> 00:36:42,194
Jeez!

485
00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:44,196
Here's the second one!

486
00:36:45,365 --> 00:36:47,992
It's in the head and the hand there.

487
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:51,328
I guess that's a defensive wound.

488
00:36:51,413 --> 00:36:52,997
Oh, yeah?

489
00:36:53,874 --> 00:36:56,125
Where's the state trooper?

490
00:36:56,209 --> 00:36:59,879
Back there a good piece, in the
ditch next to his prowler.

491
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,338
Okay.

492
00:37:02,173 --> 00:37:04,842
So we got a trooper pulls someone over.

493
00:37:04,926 --> 00:37:06,343
We got a shooting.

494
00:37:06,428 --> 00:37:07,845
These folks drive by.

495
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:10,514
There's a high-speed pursuit, ends here,

496
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:12,850
and then this execution-type deal.

497
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:14,059
Yeah.

498
00:37:15,478 --> 00:37:18,522
I'd be very surprised if our
suspect was from Brainerd.

499
00:37:18,607 --> 00:37:19,773
Yeah.

500
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,193
And I'll tell you what.

501
00:37:23,278 --> 00:37:26,363
From his footprint, he
looks like a big fella.

502
00:37:29,743 --> 00:37:32,411
You see something down there, Chief?

503
00:37:32,495 --> 00:37:35,289
No.
I just think I'm gonna barf.

504
00:37:35,373 --> 00:37:36,498
Jeez.

505
00:37:37,542 --> 00:37:39,043
You okay, Margie?

506
00:37:39,127 --> 00:37:40,711
Yeah.
I'm fine.

507
00:37:43,256 --> 00:37:45,299
It's just morning sickness.

508
00:37:47,636 --> 00:37:49,303
Well, that passed.

509
00:37:49,387 --> 00:37:50,471
Yeah?

510
00:37:50,555 --> 00:37:52,181
Yeah.
Now I'm hungry again.

511
00:37:52,849 --> 00:37:54,892
You have breakfast yet, Margie?

512
00:37:54,976 --> 00:37:56,435
Oh, yeah.

513
00:37:56,811 --> 00:37:58,020
Norm made some eggs.

514
00:37:58,104 --> 00:37:59,229
Yeah?

515
00:38:00,148 --> 00:38:01,273
Well...

516
00:38:02,484 --> 00:38:04,443
What now, do you think?

517
00:38:04,986 --> 00:38:06,570
Let's go take a look at that trooper.

518
00:38:09,991 --> 00:38:11,552
There's different footprints here, Lou.

519
00:38:11,576 --> 00:38:12,618
Yeah?

520
00:38:12,702 --> 00:38:15,371
Yeah.
This guy's smaller than his buddy.

521
00:38:15,455 --> 00:38:16,705
Oh, yeah?

522
00:38:17,499 --> 00:38:19,208
For Pete's sake.

523
00:38:19,292 --> 00:38:20,668
How's it look, Marge?

524
00:38:21,127 --> 00:38:23,754
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there,

525
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,674
and he looks like a nice enough guy.

526
00:38:26,967 --> 00:38:28,759
It's a real shame.

527
00:38:28,843 --> 00:38:30,177
Yeah.

528
00:38:32,889 --> 00:38:34,640
Didn't monkey with his car there, did you?

529
00:38:34,724 --> 00:38:35,808
No way.

530
00:38:35,892 --> 00:38:37,559
Well, somebody shut his lights.

531
00:38:37,644 --> 00:38:39,044
I guess the little guy sat in there

532
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,504
waiting for his buddy to come back.

533
00:38:40,522 --> 00:38:42,106
Yeah, it would have been cold out here.

534
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:45,109
Heck, yeah.
You think is Dave open yet?

535
00:38:45,193 --> 00:38:46,360
Dave?

536
00:38:47,195 --> 00:38:48,862
You don't think he's mixed up in...

537
00:38:48,947 --> 00:38:52,282
Oh, no, no. I just want to get
Norm some night crawlers.

538
00:38:54,995 --> 00:38:56,996
Did you look in his citation book?

539
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:02,292
Yeah. Last vehicle he wrote in
was a tan Cierra at 2:18 a.m.

540
00:39:02,377 --> 00:39:04,628
Under plate number he put "DLR."

541
00:39:04,713 --> 00:39:06,338
I figure they stopped him or shot him

542
00:39:06,423 --> 00:39:09,466
before he could finish
filling out the tag number.

543
00:39:09,551 --> 00:39:13,053
So, I got the State looking for a
Cierra with a tag starting "DLR."

544
00:39:13,138 --> 00:39:15,222
They don't got no match yet.

545
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,308
I'm not sure that I agree with you 100%

546
00:39:18,393 --> 00:39:20,394
on your police work there, Lou.

547
00:39:20,478 --> 00:39:21,812
Yeah?
Yeah.

548
00:39:22,397 --> 00:39:25,649
I think that vehicle there
probably had dealer plates.

549
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:27,526
"DLR."

550
00:39:32,866 --> 00:39:33,991
Jeez.

551
00:39:35,577 --> 00:39:36,994
Say, Lou,

552
00:39:37,078 --> 00:39:38,462
did you hear the one about the guy

553
00:39:38,546 --> 00:39:40,147
who couldn't afford personalized plates,

554
00:39:40,173 --> 00:39:43,508
so he went and changed
his name to J3L-2404?

555
00:39:44,252 --> 00:39:46,253
Yeah.
That's a good one.

556
00:39:53,511 --> 00:39:57,389
Look, all's I know is, you got a
problem, you call a professional.

557
00:39:57,474 --> 00:39:59,308
No.
They said no cops.

558
00:39:59,392 --> 00:40:01,143
They were darn clear on that, Wade.

559
00:40:01,227 --> 00:40:03,487
They said, "You call your cops,
and we're gonna shoot..."

560
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:04,988
Of course they're gonna say that.

561
00:40:05,073 --> 00:40:06,815
Where's my protection?
They got Jean here.

562
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,817
If I give these sons of bitches $1 million,

563
00:40:08,902 --> 00:40:10,703
where's my guarantee
they're gonna let her go?

564
00:40:10,779 --> 00:40:11,737
Well, they...

565
00:40:11,821 --> 00:40:13,205
$1 million is a lot of damn money.

566
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:15,298
Yeah, but... There they are.
They got my daughter.

567
00:40:15,383 --> 00:40:16,883
Think this thing through here, Wade.

568
00:40:16,967 --> 00:40:19,286
You give them what they want,
why won't they let her go?

569
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:22,247
You got to listen to me on this one, Wade.

570
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:24,124
Heck, you don't know.

571
00:40:24,209 --> 00:40:26,210
You're just whistling Dixie here.

572
00:40:26,294 --> 00:40:28,337
I'm saying the cops, they
can advise us on this.

573
00:40:28,421 --> 00:40:29,671
I'm saying call a professional.

574
00:40:29,756 --> 00:40:31,673
No.
No cops.

575
00:40:32,717 --> 00:40:35,219
That's final.
This is my deal here, Wade.

576
00:40:35,303 --> 00:40:36,303
Yeah.

577
00:40:36,387 --> 00:40:38,388
Jean is my wife here.

578
00:40:38,473 --> 00:40:41,308
I gotta tell you, Wade, I'm leaning
to Jerry's viewpoint here.

579
00:40:41,392 --> 00:40:42,392
Well...

580
00:40:42,477 --> 00:40:44,645
We got to protect Jean.
These...

581
00:40:44,729 --> 00:40:46,522
We're not holding any cards here, Wade.

582
00:40:46,606 --> 00:40:48,565
They got them all.
So they call the shots.

583
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:49,733
You're darn tooting.

584
00:40:49,818 --> 00:40:50,901
Damn it.

585
00:40:50,985 --> 00:40:52,194
I'm telling you.

586
00:40:52,278 --> 00:40:54,655
Well, why don't we...

587
00:40:55,448 --> 00:40:58,283
Stan, I'm thinking we should
offer them a half a million.

588
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,785
Now, come on here!

589
00:40:59,869 --> 00:41:01,870
No way, Wade.
No way.

590
00:41:01,955 --> 00:41:03,355
We're not horse-trading here, Wade.

591
00:41:03,373 --> 00:41:04,414
Yeah.

592
00:41:04,499 --> 00:41:06,219
We gotta just bite the
bullet on this thing.

593
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:07,376
Yeah.

594
00:41:09,295 --> 00:41:12,089
So, well, what's the
next step here, Jerry?

595
00:41:12,173 --> 00:41:14,758
They're gonna call me up and
give me instructions for a drop.

596
00:41:14,843 --> 00:41:16,726
I'm supposed to have the
money ready tomorrow.

597
00:41:16,811 --> 00:41:17,978
Damn it!

598
00:41:20,431 --> 00:41:21,974
How was everything today?

599
00:41:22,058 --> 00:41:23,851
Yeah.
Real good, now.

600
00:41:25,687 --> 00:41:27,187
How you doing?

601
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:31,150
Okay.
Now, we'll get the money together.

602
00:41:31,234 --> 00:41:33,318
Don't worry about it, Jerry.

603
00:41:33,403 --> 00:41:37,322
Now, do you want anyone at
home with you till they call?

604
00:41:37,407 --> 00:41:38,907
No, I...
They don't...

605
00:41:38,992 --> 00:41:40,793
They were just supposed
to be dealing with me.

606
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:42,035
They were real clear.
Yeah.

607
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,288
You know, they said no one listening in.

608
00:41:44,372 --> 00:41:45,581
They'll be watching.

609
00:41:45,665 --> 00:41:47,624
You know, maybe it's all bull,

610
00:41:47,709 --> 00:41:50,252
but like you said, Stan,
they're calling the shots.

611
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,503
Okay.

612
00:41:51,963 --> 00:41:54,548
Now, is Scotty gonna be all right?

613
00:41:56,426 --> 00:41:58,343
Yeah. Jeez.
Scotty.

614
00:41:58,887 --> 00:42:00,679
Yeah.
I'll go talk to him.

615
00:42:16,404 --> 00:42:18,530
How you doing there, Scotty?

616
00:42:18,948 --> 00:42:20,157
Dad...

617
00:42:21,075 --> 00:42:22,910
What are they doing?

618
00:42:23,745 --> 00:42:25,385
What do you think they're doing with Mom?

619
00:42:25,455 --> 00:42:27,122
It's okay, Scotty.

620
00:42:27,248 --> 00:42:28,957
They're not gonna wanna hurt her any.

621
00:42:29,042 --> 00:42:31,668
These men, they just want money.

622
00:42:32,337 --> 00:42:34,504
Yeah, well, what if
something goes wrong, Dad?

623
00:42:34,589 --> 00:42:38,175
No, no.
Nothing's going wrong here.

624
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:42,471
Granddad and I, we're, we're making
sure this gets handled right.

625
00:42:43,389 --> 00:42:45,557
I really think we should
call the cops here.

626
00:42:45,642 --> 00:42:48,936
No. No.
No one can know about this thing.

627
00:42:49,354 --> 00:42:51,271
We gotta play ball with these guys.

628
00:42:51,356 --> 00:42:53,482
You ask Stan Grossman, he'll
tell you the same thing.

629
00:42:53,566 --> 00:42:54,524
Yeah.
But, Dad...

630
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:58,111
We're gonna get Mom back for
you, but we gotta play ball.

631
00:42:58,363 --> 00:42:59,613
You know?

632
00:43:01,157 --> 00:43:03,033
That's the deal here.

633
00:43:07,163 --> 00:43:09,957
So if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia,

634
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:13,585
you just say Mom's down in
Florida, with Pearl and Marty.

635
00:43:17,632 --> 00:43:19,925
That's the best we can do here.

636
00:44:03,636 --> 00:44:04,970
No!

637
00:44:22,071 --> 00:44:23,113
No!

638
00:44:28,536 --> 00:44:30,287
Oh, God.

639
00:44:46,346 --> 00:44:47,429
Lunchtime.

640
00:44:47,513 --> 00:44:48,680
Thanks, Margaret.

641
00:44:48,765 --> 00:44:50,515
Hi.
Hey.

642
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:52,601
Willy.
Carol.

643
00:44:53,353 --> 00:44:55,312
Janie, two more of those
Skin So Soft, please.

644
00:44:55,396 --> 00:44:56,396
Sure thing.

645
00:44:57,899 --> 00:44:59,316
Hiya, hon.

646
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,193
I brought you some lunch, Margie.

647
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,520
What are those?
Night crawlers?

648
00:45:03,571 --> 00:45:04,654
Yeah.

649
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:05,989
Thanks, hon.

650
00:45:06,074 --> 00:45:08,158
You bet.
Thanks for lunch.

651
00:45:08,242 --> 00:45:10,369
Yeah.
Looks pretty good.

652
00:45:10,453 --> 00:45:13,330
What do we got here, Arby's?

653
00:45:13,414 --> 00:45:14,915
How's the painting going?

654
00:45:14,999 --> 00:45:16,458
Pretty good.

655
00:45:17,335 --> 00:45:19,920
Found out the Hautmans are
entering a painting this year.

656
00:45:20,004 --> 00:45:22,130
Hon, you're better than them.

657
00:45:22,215 --> 00:45:24,091
They're real good.

658
00:45:24,175 --> 00:45:27,260
They're good, Norm,
but you're better than them.

659
00:45:28,262 --> 00:45:29,679
You think so?

660
00:45:31,307 --> 00:45:33,600
Hey, you got Arby's all over me.

661
00:45:35,978 --> 00:45:38,063
Hiya, Norm.
How's the painting going?

662
00:45:38,147 --> 00:45:39,689
Not too bad.
You know.

663
00:45:39,774 --> 00:45:41,066
How we doing on that vehicle?

664
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:43,819
Well, no motels registered
any tan Cierra last night,

665
00:45:43,903 --> 00:45:47,322
but the night before, two men
checked into the Blue Ox,

666
00:45:47,407 --> 00:45:50,534
registering a Cierra and
leaving the tag space blank.

667
00:45:50,618 --> 00:45:51,743
Jeez, that's a good lead.

668
00:45:51,828 --> 00:45:52,911
Yeah.

669
00:45:52,995 --> 00:45:55,497
Blue Ox, that's that truckers'
joint out there on I-35?

670
00:45:55,581 --> 00:45:58,208
Yeah.
Owner was on the desk then.

671
00:45:58,292 --> 00:46:00,210
Said these two had company.

672
00:46:00,294 --> 00:46:01,378
Oh, yeah?

673
00:46:01,504 --> 00:46:02,629
Yeah.

674
00:46:06,551 --> 00:46:08,844
Yeah, we both did.
She went to college, too.

675
00:46:08,928 --> 00:46:11,204
I went to Normandale
for about a year and a half.

676
00:46:11,288 --> 00:46:12,413
Yeah, that's where we met.

677
00:46:12,498 --> 00:46:13,581
But I dropped out, though.

678
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:14,407
Yeah.
She dropped.

679
00:46:14,492 --> 00:46:15,534
Yeah.

680
00:46:15,768 --> 00:46:17,227
So where you girls from?

681
00:46:17,311 --> 00:46:19,146
Chaska.
Le Sueur.

682
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:21,398
But I went to high school
in White Bear Lake.

683
00:46:21,482 --> 00:46:22,732
Go Bears.

684
00:46:23,526 --> 00:46:27,237
Okay. I want you to tell me
what these fellows looked like.

685
00:46:27,488 --> 00:46:29,488
Well, the little guy, he
was kind of funny-looking.

686
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:30,490
In what way?

687
00:46:30,575 --> 00:46:32,492
I don't know.
Just funny-looking.

688
00:46:32,577 --> 00:46:34,911
Can you be any more specific?

689
00:46:34,996 --> 00:46:36,371
I couldn't really say.

690
00:46:36,456 --> 00:46:37,873
He wasn't circumcised.

691
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:41,793
Was he funny-looking apart from that?

692
00:46:41,878 --> 00:46:43,003
Yeah.

693
00:46:44,297 --> 00:46:47,841
So, you were having sex
with the little fella, then.

694
00:46:49,469 --> 00:46:51,470
Is there anything else
you can tell me about him?

695
00:46:51,554 --> 00:46:54,431
No.
Like I say, he was funny-looking.

696
00:46:54,515 --> 00:46:56,558
More than most people, even.

697
00:46:56,642 --> 00:46:57,809
What about the other fella?

698
00:46:57,894 --> 00:46:59,060
He was a little older.

699
00:46:59,145 --> 00:47:00,896
You know, he looked like the Marlboro Man.

700
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,606
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

701
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:04,149
But maybe I'm saying that, you know,

702
00:47:04,233 --> 00:47:06,568
'cause he smoked a lot of Marlboros.

703
00:47:06,652 --> 00:47:08,445
You know, like a
subconscious type of thing.

704
00:47:08,529 --> 00:47:09,696
Oh, yeah, that can happen.

705
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,822
Yeah.

706
00:47:10,907 --> 00:47:12,949
Hey, they said they were
going to the Twin Cities.

707
00:47:13,034 --> 00:47:14,493
Oh, yeah?
Yeah!

708
00:47:14,577 --> 00:47:16,077
Yeah, is that useful to you?

709
00:47:16,162 --> 00:47:17,704
You betcha.
Yeah.

710
00:47:17,788 --> 00:47:19,122
Yeah.
Yeah.

711
00:47:21,292 --> 00:47:22,459
Come on!

712
00:47:23,669 --> 00:47:24,920
Goddamn it!

713
00:47:27,215 --> 00:47:28,882
Jesus Christ.

714
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,385
Fucking shitbox.

715
00:47:33,804 --> 00:47:35,555
Been here for days.

716
00:47:36,891 --> 00:47:38,767
Damn it.
Nothing to do.

717
00:47:40,061 --> 00:47:42,103
Fucking TV doesn't even...

718
00:47:44,065 --> 00:47:47,817
Damn it, come on! Plug me in, man.
Give me a fucking signal.

719
00:47:49,612 --> 00:47:51,321
Goddamn it!

720
00:47:53,824 --> 00:47:55,784
Unbelievable!
Come on!

721
00:47:56,327 --> 00:47:57,327
God...

722
00:47:58,162 --> 00:47:59,329
Fuck!

723
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:02,707
Come on, plug me into the ozone, baby!
Come on!

724
00:48:04,252 --> 00:48:05,544
Come on!

725
00:48:07,338 --> 00:48:09,089
Fuck!
Fuck!

726
00:48:10,216 --> 00:48:11,675
Fuck!
Fuck!

727
00:48:18,307 --> 00:48:21,851
The bark beetle
carries the worm to its nest

728
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:26,231
where it will feed its young
for up to six months.

729
00:48:28,943 --> 00:48:32,195
In the spring, the larvae hatch,
and the cycle begins again.

730
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,530
Well...

731
00:48:34,824 --> 00:48:36,700
I'm turning in, Norm.

732
00:48:37,201 --> 00:48:38,535
Oh, yeah?

733
00:48:41,455 --> 00:48:43,790
Here it is, throwing
off the larval envelope.

734
00:48:57,847 --> 00:48:58,888
Hello?

735
00:48:58,973 --> 00:49:00,974
Yeah.
Is this Marge?

736
00:49:01,267 --> 00:49:02,309
Yeah.

737
00:49:02,393 --> 00:49:04,019
Margie Olmstead?

738
00:49:05,104 --> 00:49:07,230
Yeah.
Who's this?

739
00:49:07,315 --> 00:49:09,566
This is Mike Yanagita!

740
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:12,235
You know, Mike Yanagita.
Remember me?

741
00:49:14,655 --> 00:49:16,156
Mike Yanagita?

742
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,657
Yeah!

743
00:49:18,242 --> 00:49:20,368
Well, yeah!

744
00:49:21,037 --> 00:49:22,662
Course I remember you.

745
00:49:22,747 --> 00:49:25,206
How are you doing?
What time is it?

746
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:27,709
Oh, jeez.
It's 10:45.

747
00:49:27,793 --> 00:49:29,169
I hope I didn't wake you.

748
00:49:29,253 --> 00:49:32,005
No.
That's okay.

749
00:49:32,089 --> 00:49:34,174
Yeah, I'm down in the Twin Cities,

750
00:49:34,258 --> 00:49:37,135
and I was just watching on TV about
these shootings up in Brainerd.

751
00:49:37,219 --> 00:49:38,720
And I saw you on the news there.

752
00:49:38,804 --> 00:49:39,846
Yeah.

753
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:41,673
I thought, "Jeez, is that Margie Olmstead?"

754
00:49:41,757 --> 00:49:42,724
I can't believe it.

755
00:49:42,808 --> 00:49:45,101
Yeah, that's me.

756
00:49:45,853 --> 00:49:47,520
Well, how the heck are you?

757
00:49:47,605 --> 00:49:49,230
Okay.
You know.

758
00:49:50,107 --> 00:49:51,107
Okay.

759
00:49:51,192 --> 00:49:52,692
Yeah?
Yeah.

760
00:49:53,319 --> 00:49:54,778
How you doing?

761
00:49:54,862 --> 00:49:56,488
Pretty good.

762
00:49:57,490 --> 00:49:59,115
Well, heck.

763
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,534
It's been such a long time, Mike.

764
00:50:02,328 --> 00:50:04,412
It's great to hear from you.

765
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:09,626
Yeah, you got your...

766
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:12,796
This is loaded here.
This has your independent...

767
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,216
Your front-wheel drive,
rack-and-pinion steering,

768
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,219
anti-lock brakes, alarm, radar,

769
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,305
and I can give it to you
with a heck of a sealant.

770
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:24,641
This TruCoat stuff,
it'll keep the salt off.

771
00:50:24,725 --> 00:50:26,559
Yeah, I don't need no sealant, though.

772
00:50:26,644 --> 00:50:28,478
Yeah.
You don't need that.

773
00:50:28,562 --> 00:50:30,313
Now, were you thinking of financing here?

774
00:50:30,398 --> 00:50:33,024
You ought to be aware of this
GMAC plan they have now.

775
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:34,150
It's really super.

776
00:50:34,235 --> 00:50:35,435
Got a call for you, Jerry.

777
00:50:35,486 --> 00:50:36,861
Yeah, okay.

778
00:50:43,786 --> 00:50:44,953
Jerry Lundegaard.

779
00:50:45,037 --> 00:50:47,163
All right, Jerry, you
got the phone to yourself?

780
00:50:47,248 --> 00:50:48,331
Well, yeah.

781
00:50:48,416 --> 00:50:49,457
You know who this is?

782
00:50:49,542 --> 00:50:51,501
Well, yeah, I got an idea.

783
00:50:51,585 --> 00:50:53,461
How's that Cierra working out for you?

784
00:50:53,546 --> 00:50:55,797
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.

785
00:50:55,881 --> 00:50:57,006
Well...

786
00:50:57,883 --> 00:50:58,883
What do you mean?

787
00:50:58,968 --> 00:51:02,679
Things have changed. Circumstances,
Jerry, beyond the acts of God.

788
00:51:02,763 --> 00:51:03,847
Force majeure.

789
00:51:03,931 --> 00:51:05,181
What the...

790
00:51:05,266 --> 00:51:06,599
How's Jean?

791
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:09,060
Who's Jean?

792
00:51:09,145 --> 00:51:11,104
My wife.
What the...

793
00:51:11,188 --> 00:51:13,431
She's all right, but there's
three people up in Brainerd

794
00:51:13,515 --> 00:51:15,124
who aren't so okay, I'll tell you that.

795
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:16,675
What the heck are you talking about?

796
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,285
Let's just finish this deal up here.

797
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:20,338
Blood has been shed, Jerry.

798
00:51:20,489 --> 00:51:21,531
What the heck do you mean?

799
00:51:21,615 --> 00:51:23,491
Three people in Brainerd.

800
00:51:23,576 --> 00:51:24,617
Oh, jeez.

801
00:51:24,702 --> 00:51:26,745
That's right, and we need more money.

802
00:51:26,829 --> 00:51:28,337
What the heck are you talking about?

803
00:51:28,422 --> 00:51:30,239
What do you fellas
got yourself mixed up in?

804
00:51:30,324 --> 00:51:31,166
We need more money...

805
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,293
This was supposed to be
a no-rough-stuff type deal.

806
00:51:33,377 --> 00:51:35,962
Don't ever interrupt me, Jerry!
Just shut the fuck up!

807
00:51:36,046 --> 00:51:38,214
Well, I'm sorry, but I just, I...

808
00:51:38,299 --> 00:51:40,425
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
I'm not gonna debate!

809
00:51:40,509 --> 00:51:42,051
We now want the entire 80,000.

810
00:51:42,136 --> 00:51:44,012
For Christ's sake here.

811
00:51:44,096 --> 00:51:45,305
Blood has been shed.

812
00:51:45,389 --> 00:51:46,639
We've incurred risk, Jerry.

813
00:51:46,724 --> 00:51:47,924
I'm coming into town tomorrow.

814
00:51:47,975 --> 00:51:49,058
You have the money ready.

815
00:51:49,143 --> 00:51:51,561
Now, we had a deal here.
A deal's a deal.

816
00:51:51,645 --> 00:51:52,687
Is it, Jerry?

817
00:51:52,772 --> 00:51:55,339
You ask those three poor souls up
in Brainerd if a deal's a deal.

818
00:51:55,424 --> 00:51:56,249
Go ahead, ask them!

819
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:57,275
The heck do you mean?

820
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,778
"The heck do you mean?"
I'll see you tomorrow.

821
00:52:04,033 --> 00:52:05,033
Yeah?

822
00:52:05,117 --> 00:52:06,159
Jerome Lundegaard?

823
00:52:06,243 --> 00:52:07,285
Yeah.

824
00:52:07,369 --> 00:52:09,037
This is Reilly Diefenbach at GMAC.

825
00:52:09,121 --> 00:52:11,873
Sir, I've not received those
vehicle IDs you promised.

826
00:52:11,957 --> 00:52:13,291
Yeah.
I...

827
00:52:13,709 --> 00:52:14,959
Those are in the mail.

828
00:52:15,044 --> 00:52:17,796
That very well may be.
I must inform you, however,

829
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,673
that absent the receipt of those
numbers by tomorrow afternoon,

830
00:52:20,758 --> 00:52:23,259
I will have to refer this
matter to our legal department.

831
00:52:23,344 --> 00:52:24,385
Yeah.

832
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:26,221
My patience is at an end.
Yeah.

833
00:52:26,305 --> 00:52:27,806
Good day, sir.
Yeah.

834
00:53:26,657 --> 00:53:29,117
Hi, Norm.
How you doing, Margie?

835
00:53:29,869 --> 00:53:31,202
How's the fricassee?

836
00:53:31,287 --> 00:53:32,745
Pretty darn good.
You want some?

837
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:34,080
Oh, no.
I got...

838
00:53:34,164 --> 00:53:38,126
Hey, Norm, I thought you was going
ice fishing up at Mille Lacs.

839
00:53:38,794 --> 00:53:40,503
Yeah.
After lunch.

840
00:53:40,963 --> 00:53:42,297
What you got there?

841
00:53:42,381 --> 00:53:44,799
The numbers you asked for.

842
00:53:44,884 --> 00:53:47,552
Calls made from the lobby
pay phone at the Blue Ox.

843
00:53:47,636 --> 00:53:49,679
Two to Minneapolis that night.

844
00:53:49,763 --> 00:53:51,097
First one's a trucking company

845
00:53:51,181 --> 00:53:53,057
and second one's a private residence,

846
00:53:53,142 --> 00:53:54,809
a Shep Proudfoot.

847
00:53:55,936 --> 00:53:57,186
A what?

848
00:53:57,271 --> 00:53:59,522
Shep Proudfoot.
That's a name.

849
00:54:00,274 --> 00:54:01,482
Yeah.

850
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:04,235
Okay.
Yeah.

851
00:54:05,321 --> 00:54:07,196
Think I'll take a drive down there, then.

852
00:54:07,281 --> 00:54:09,198
Oh, yeah?
Twin Cities.

853
00:54:11,952 --> 00:54:13,244
Oh, yeah?

854
00:54:27,426 --> 00:54:30,303
Damn it, I want to be a part of this thing.

855
00:54:30,387 --> 00:54:32,597
No.
Wade, they were real clear.

856
00:54:32,681 --> 00:54:34,601
They said they'd call
tomorrow with instructions,

857
00:54:34,642 --> 00:54:36,517
and it's gotta be delivered by me alone.

858
00:54:36,602 --> 00:54:38,853
It's my money, I'll deliver it.

859
00:54:39,355 --> 00:54:40,647
What do they care?

860
00:54:40,731 --> 00:54:42,023
Wade's got a point, there.

861
00:54:42,107 --> 00:54:43,766
I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.

862
00:54:43,851 --> 00:54:44,901
No, no.
See, they...

863
00:54:44,985 --> 00:54:47,236
No.
See, they only deal with me.

864
00:54:47,321 --> 00:54:51,074
You feel this nervousness
on the phone there.

865
00:54:51,158 --> 00:54:53,868
They're very...
These guys are dangerous.

866
00:54:53,953 --> 00:54:56,454
All the more reason.
I don't want you...

867
00:54:56,538 --> 00:54:59,415
With all due respect, Jerry, I
don't want you mucking this up.

868
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,540
What the heck do you mean?

869
00:55:00,584 --> 00:55:02,226
They want my money,
they can deal with me.

870
00:55:02,311 --> 00:55:03,872
Otherwise, I'm going to a professional.

871
00:55:03,896 --> 00:55:05,421
No, see...
There's $1 million here.

872
00:55:05,506 --> 00:55:06,589
No.
See...

873
00:55:06,674 --> 00:55:09,467
Look, Jerry, you're not
selling me a damn car!

874
00:55:09,551 --> 00:55:11,886
It's my show here.
That's that!

875
00:55:13,597 --> 00:55:16,557
It's the way we'd prefer
to handle it, Jerry.

876
00:55:22,606 --> 00:55:24,649
Hi.
How you doing?

877
00:55:24,733 --> 00:55:26,442
Real good.
How are you doing today, ma'am?

878
00:55:26,527 --> 00:55:28,778
I'm doing really super there.
Thanks.

879
00:55:28,862 --> 00:55:31,698
I'm Mrs. Gunderson.
I have a reservation.

880
00:55:32,866 --> 00:55:35,201
Yep.
You sure do, Mrs. Gunderson.

881
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:38,204
Is there a phone down here, you think?

882
00:55:40,374 --> 00:55:42,041
Detective Sibert?

883
00:55:42,126 --> 00:55:45,670
Yeah, this is Marge Gunderson
from up Brainerd. We spoke.

884
00:55:46,422 --> 00:55:48,965
Yeah.
Well, actually, I'm in town here.

885
00:55:49,049 --> 00:55:51,009
I had to do a few things
in the Twin Cities,

886
00:55:51,093 --> 00:55:52,677
so I thought I'd check in with you

887
00:55:52,761 --> 00:55:55,263
about that USFI search on Shep Proudfoot.

888
00:55:57,016 --> 00:55:58,307
Oh, yeah?

889
00:55:59,184 --> 00:56:02,353
Well, maybe I'll go visit
with him if I have...

890
00:56:02,438 --> 00:56:04,313
No.
I can find that.

891
00:56:05,357 --> 00:56:06,482
Yeah.
Well, thanks a bunch.

892
00:56:06,567 --> 00:56:09,360
Say, say, would you happen to know

893
00:56:09,445 --> 00:56:12,363
a good place for lunch
in the downtown area?

894
00:56:13,198 --> 00:56:14,657
The Radisson.

895
00:56:15,701 --> 00:56:17,744
Oh, yeah?
Is it reasonable?

896
00:57:34,863 --> 00:57:36,948
Hi.
How you doing?

897
00:57:37,032 --> 00:57:39,492
Yeah.
I decided not to park here.

898
00:57:39,952 --> 00:57:42,161
Well, what do you mean?
You decided not to park here?

899
00:57:42,246 --> 00:57:45,081
Yeah, I just came in and I
decided not to park here, so...

900
00:57:45,165 --> 00:57:47,834
But...
Well, I'm sorry, sir...

901
00:57:47,918 --> 00:57:50,211
Yeah, I decided not to...
I...

902
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:52,296
You know, I'm not...

903
00:57:52,381 --> 00:57:54,715
I decided not to take the
trip, as it turns out, so...

904
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,010
Well, I'm sorry, sir, we still
got to charge you the $4.

905
00:57:59,847 --> 00:58:01,139
I just pulled in here.

906
00:58:01,265 --> 00:58:02,598
I just fucking pulled in here.

907
00:58:02,683 --> 00:58:03,766
Well, but...

908
00:58:03,851 --> 00:58:06,310
See, there's a minimum charge of $4.

909
00:58:06,395 --> 00:58:09,188
Long-term parking charges by the day.

910
00:58:13,902 --> 00:58:17,029
I guess you think you're, you
know, like an authority figure.

911
00:58:17,114 --> 00:58:19,448
That stupid fucking uniform, buddy?

912
00:58:19,533 --> 00:58:20,950
King clip-on tie there.

913
00:58:21,034 --> 00:58:22,451
Big fucking man?

914
00:58:23,078 --> 00:58:25,329
You know, these are the
limits of your life, man.

915
00:58:25,414 --> 00:58:26,989
Ruler of your little fucking gate here.

916
00:58:27,074 --> 00:58:29,700
Here. There's your $4,
you pathetic piece of shit.

917
00:58:32,087 --> 00:58:33,588
Where's Shep?

918
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:35,506
Talking to a cop.

919
00:58:35,591 --> 00:58:36,757
Cop?

920
00:58:37,092 --> 00:58:38,843
Said she was a cop.

921
00:58:41,471 --> 00:58:44,307
So do you remember
getting a call Wednesday night?

922
00:58:44,391 --> 00:58:45,516
Nope.

923
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:49,395
You do reside there
at 1425 Freemont Terrace?

924
00:58:49,479 --> 00:58:50,479
Yep.

925
00:58:50,564 --> 00:58:52,565
Anyone else residing there?

926
00:58:52,649 --> 00:58:53,733
No.

927
00:58:53,817 --> 00:58:57,820
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call
came in past 3:00 in the morning.

928
00:58:57,905 --> 00:59:02,033
It's just hard for me to believe
you don't remember anyone calling.

929
00:59:02,534 --> 00:59:04,827
Now, I know you've had some problems.

930
00:59:04,912 --> 00:59:06,746
Struggling with the narcotics,

931
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:09,749
some other entanglements,
currently on parole.

932
00:59:10,459 --> 00:59:11,459
So?

933
00:59:11,543 --> 00:59:12,960
Well, associating with criminals,

934
00:59:13,045 --> 00:59:14,366
if you're the one they talked to,

935
00:59:14,379 --> 00:59:17,506
that right there would be a
violation of your parole.

936
00:59:17,591 --> 00:59:20,092
Would end you up back in Stillwater.

937
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:22,511
Now, I saw some rough stuff on your priors,

938
00:59:22,596 --> 00:59:24,197
but nothing in the nature of a homicide.

939
00:59:24,264 --> 00:59:28,267
I know you don't want to be an
accessory to something like that.

940
00:59:30,229 --> 00:59:31,554
So, you think you might remember

941
00:59:31,638 --> 00:59:34,140
who those folks were who called you?

942
00:59:42,824 --> 00:59:44,075
Mr. Lundegaard?

943
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:45,368
Yeah.

944
00:59:45,452 --> 00:59:47,328
Could I take just a minute
of your time here?

945
00:59:47,412 --> 00:59:49,205
What is it all about?

946
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:50,957
Do you mind if I sit down?

947
00:59:51,041 --> 00:59:53,084
Carrying quite a load here.

948
00:59:53,293 --> 00:59:55,169
You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?

949
00:59:55,254 --> 00:59:57,588
No. I...
Executive Sales Manager.

950
00:59:57,673 --> 00:59:59,607
Well, you can help me.
My name's Marge Gunderson.

951
00:59:59,691 --> 01:00:01,717
My father-in-law, he's the owner.

952
01:00:03,053 --> 01:00:05,054
Well, I'm a police officer
from up Brainerd,

953
01:00:05,138 --> 01:00:06,889
investigating some malfeasance.

954
01:00:06,974 --> 01:00:09,433
And I was just wondering if
you'd had any new vehicles

955
01:00:09,518 --> 01:00:12,603
stolen off the lot
in the past couple of weeks.

956
01:00:13,814 --> 01:00:16,148
Specifically a tan Cutlass Cierra.

957
01:00:20,737 --> 01:00:22,280
Mr. Lundegaard.

958
01:00:24,866 --> 01:00:26,158
Brainerd.

959
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:28,244
Yeah, yeah.

960
01:00:28,328 --> 01:00:30,830
Home of Paul Bunyan, Babe, the Blue Ox.

961
01:00:30,914 --> 01:00:32,581
Babe, the Blue Ox.

962
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:39,797
Yeah, you know, we got
that big statue up there.

963
01:00:42,301 --> 01:00:45,928
So, you haven't had any
vehicles go missing, then?

964
01:00:46,013 --> 01:00:47,513
Nope.
No, ma'am.

965
01:00:48,432 --> 01:00:49,724
Okey-dokey.
Thanks a bunch.

966
01:00:49,808 --> 01:00:52,810
I'll let you get back
to your paperwork, then.

967
01:01:06,992 --> 01:01:08,534
Service.
Yeah, get me Shep.

968
01:01:08,618 --> 01:01:09,869
He's not here right now.

969
01:01:09,953 --> 01:01:10,995
What the heck do you mean?

970
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:12,621
He stepped out.

971
01:01:12,706 --> 01:01:14,565
Where'd he go? It's only...
I'll get you Artie.

972
01:01:14,649 --> 01:01:17,818
No. I don't need a mechanic.
I need a...

973
01:01:19,963 --> 01:01:23,507
Jeez.
I gotta talk to a friend of his,

974
01:01:23,967 --> 01:01:25,551
so...

975
01:01:26,178 --> 01:01:28,220
Have him...

976
01:01:29,556 --> 01:01:30,639
What?

977
01:01:30,724 --> 01:01:31,724
Oh, jeez.

978
01:01:52,579 --> 01:01:53,704
Mike?

979
01:01:54,581 --> 01:01:55,706
Marge?

980
01:01:57,626 --> 01:02:00,336
Jeez!
You look great!

981
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,671
Yeah. So do you.
Easy there. Easy...

982
01:02:02,756 --> 01:02:06,092
Easy there. Easy there.
You do, too.

983
01:02:06,176 --> 01:02:07,802
I'm expecting now.

984
01:02:07,886 --> 01:02:10,096
I see that.
That's great.

985
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:11,555
What can I get you?

986
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,516
Just a Diet Coke, please.

987
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,184
Great.

988
01:02:15,936 --> 01:02:17,228
This is a nice place.

989
01:02:17,312 --> 01:02:20,773
Yeah. You know, it's the
Radisson, so it's pretty good.

990
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:21,982
Yeah.

991
01:02:26,446 --> 01:02:27,530
So...

992
01:02:28,281 --> 01:02:29,698
You're living in Edina, then?

993
01:02:29,783 --> 01:02:31,867
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A couple of years now.

994
01:02:31,952 --> 01:02:33,702
It's actually Eden Prairie.

995
01:02:33,787 --> 01:02:35,329
That school district.

996
01:02:35,747 --> 01:02:38,416
So, Chief Gunderson, then!

997
01:02:38,792 --> 01:02:41,377
So, you went and married
Norm son-of-a-Gunderson.

998
01:02:41,461 --> 01:02:43,129
Oh, yeah.
Long time ago.

999
01:02:43,213 --> 01:02:44,839
Great, great.

1000
01:02:45,173 --> 01:02:47,633
So, what brings you down?

1001
01:02:48,135 --> 01:02:49,844
Are you down here on that homicide,

1002
01:02:49,928 --> 01:02:52,179
if you're allowed, you
know, to discuss that?

1003
01:02:52,264 --> 01:02:53,556
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1004
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,434
But there's not a heck of a lot to discuss.

1005
01:02:57,310 --> 01:02:58,853
Okay.

1006
01:02:58,937 --> 01:03:00,229
Well, what about you, Mike?

1007
01:03:00,313 --> 01:03:01,564
Are you married?

1008
01:03:01,648 --> 01:03:02,731
You got kids?

1009
01:03:02,816 --> 01:03:04,608
Yeah, yeah.
Well...

1010
01:03:05,152 --> 01:03:07,862
I was married.
I was married to...

1011
01:03:07,946 --> 01:03:09,864
You mind if I sit over here?

1012
01:03:09,948 --> 01:03:11,949
I was married to Linda Cooksey.

1013
01:03:12,033 --> 01:03:15,119
No. Why don't you sit over there?
I prefer that.

1014
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:19,457
Okay.

1015
01:03:22,335 --> 01:03:23,419
Sorry.

1016
01:03:23,503 --> 01:03:26,255
No, no. Just so I can see you.
Don't have to turn my neck.

1017
01:03:26,339 --> 01:03:28,591
Sure, sure.
I understand.

1018
01:03:29,843 --> 01:03:31,093
I didn't mean to...

1019
01:03:31,178 --> 01:03:34,638
No, no.
That's fine.

1020
01:03:36,641 --> 01:03:39,185
Yeah, sorry.
Sorry.

1021
01:03:40,061 --> 01:03:42,605
So, I was married to Linda Cooksey.

1022
01:03:42,689 --> 01:03:45,483
You remember Linda.
She was a year behind us.

1023
01:03:45,567 --> 01:03:47,026
Yeah.
I think I remember her.

1024
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:49,904
Yeah! She...
Oh, yeah!

1025
01:03:49,988 --> 01:03:51,572
So, it didn't work out?

1026
01:03:51,656 --> 01:03:55,201
And then I've been working for
Honeywell for a few years now.

1027
01:03:55,285 --> 01:03:56,452
Well, they're a good outfit.

1028
01:03:56,536 --> 01:04:00,289
Yeah, if you're an engineer,
yeah, you could do a lot worse.

1029
01:04:00,373 --> 01:04:02,041
But it's not...

1030
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:04,293
It's nothing like your achievement.

1031
01:04:04,377 --> 01:04:07,379
Well, it sounds like
you're doing really super.

1032
01:04:07,464 --> 01:04:09,048
It's not that...

1033
01:04:09,132 --> 01:04:12,384
It's not that things didn't work out.
It's...

1034
01:04:13,803 --> 01:04:16,597
Linda had leukemia, you know.

1035
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:19,517
She was...
She passed away.

1036
01:04:19,601 --> 01:04:21,018
No.

1037
01:04:23,438 --> 01:04:24,563
It was tough.

1038
01:04:24,648 --> 01:04:25,940
There you go.

1039
01:04:26,399 --> 01:04:28,067
It was long...

1040
01:04:29,444 --> 01:04:32,071
She fought real hard, Marge.

1041
01:04:32,948 --> 01:04:34,323
You know...

1042
01:04:35,075 --> 01:04:36,659
So, what can you say?

1043
01:04:39,621 --> 01:04:41,914
Better times?

1044
01:04:41,998 --> 01:04:43,457
Better times.

1045
01:04:46,044 --> 01:04:50,881
And then I saw you on the TV
and I remembered, you know?

1046
01:04:51,091 --> 01:04:52,758
I always liked you.

1047
01:04:52,842 --> 01:04:54,093
Well, I always liked you...

1048
01:04:54,177 --> 01:04:55,928
I always liked you so much.

1049
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:02,893
So, Mike, should we get together
another time, you think?

1050
01:05:02,978 --> 01:05:04,311
No!
I...

1051
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:10,317
I'm sorry.
It's...

1052
01:05:10,402 --> 01:05:12,778
You know, I shouldn't have done this.

1053
01:05:12,862 --> 01:05:14,905
I shouldn't have done this.
I shouldn't.

1054
01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:17,533
I thought we'd have a really terrific time.

1055
01:05:17,617 --> 01:05:19,034
It's okay, Mike.

1056
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:21,620
You were such a super lady.

1057
01:05:21,705 --> 01:05:24,957
And then...
I've been so lonely.

1058
01:05:27,836 --> 01:05:29,336
It's okay, Mike.

1059
01:05:35,677 --> 01:05:39,513
Here's a song I dedicate to
all the ladies out here tonight.

1060
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:41,807
Goes like this.

1061
01:05:54,195 --> 01:05:55,487
So...

1062
01:05:56,156 --> 01:05:58,115
Are you from around here?

1063
01:05:58,908 --> 01:06:00,743
Just in town on business.

1064
01:06:01,328 --> 01:06:02,411
Just in and out.

1065
01:06:05,165 --> 01:06:07,708
Just a little of the old in-and-out.

1066
01:06:08,835 --> 01:06:10,252
What do you do?

1067
01:06:16,593 --> 01:06:18,113
You been to the Celebrity Room before?

1068
01:06:18,178 --> 01:06:20,137
With other clients?

1069
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:22,097
I don't think so.

1070
01:06:22,182 --> 01:06:23,641
It's nice.

1071
01:06:23,725 --> 01:06:26,185
Yeah, well, depends on the artist.

1072
01:06:26,353 --> 01:06:29,480
You know, Jose Feliciano,
you got no complaints.

1073
01:06:30,106 --> 01:06:31,190
Waiter!

1074
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,027
What is he, deaf?

1075
01:06:35,862 --> 01:06:37,112
So...

1076
01:06:38,198 --> 01:06:40,574
How long you work for the escort service?

1077
01:06:40,659 --> 01:06:42,743
I don't know.
A few months.

1078
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:46,330
Find that work interesting, do you?

1079
01:06:47,415 --> 01:06:49,458
What are you talking about?

1080
01:06:50,001 --> 01:06:51,293
Right.

1081
01:06:51,378 --> 01:06:52,711
Come on.

1082
01:06:52,796 --> 01:06:54,797
I'm hearing bells.
Come on.

1083
01:06:56,633 --> 01:06:59,176
All right.
Where were you?

1084
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:06,809
Shep, what the hell are you doing?
I'm banging that girl.

1085
01:07:06,893 --> 01:07:11,271
Fucking asshole.
Get the fuck out of here.

1086
01:07:11,398 --> 01:07:14,358
Put me back in Stillwater,
you little fucking shithead.

1087
01:07:14,442 --> 01:07:15,984
Get the fuck out of here.

1088
01:07:17,195 --> 01:07:19,071
Yo!
Cut that shit out, man.

1089
01:07:19,155 --> 01:07:21,115
Trying to get some goddamn sleep here.

1090
01:07:22,242 --> 01:07:23,283
Come on, brother...

1091
01:07:23,368 --> 01:07:24,618
Fuck you!

1092
01:07:31,042 --> 01:07:32,459
Fuck you.

1093
01:07:32,544 --> 01:07:33,711
Animals!

1094
01:07:35,714 --> 01:07:37,339
Stay away from me, man.

1095
01:07:37,424 --> 01:07:39,508
Hey, smoke a fucking peace pipe!

1096
01:07:39,592 --> 01:07:41,468
Don't you dare fucking hit me!

1097
01:07:48,893 --> 01:07:50,602
Fucking little weasel!

1098
01:07:50,687 --> 01:07:52,396
Fuck you, man.
Stop it!

1099
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,316
You fucking, motherfucking,
son-of-a-bitching, fucking cock!

1100
01:07:56,401 --> 01:08:00,028
Jesus Christ!
You fucking shitbag motherfucker!

1101
01:08:03,992 --> 01:08:04,992
Yeah?

1102
01:08:05,076 --> 01:08:06,885
All right, Jerry,
I'm through fucking around.

1103
01:08:06,969 --> 01:08:08,053
You got the fucking money?

1104
01:08:08,137 --> 01:08:09,580
Yeah, I got the money, but...

1105
01:08:09,664 --> 01:08:11,373
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.

1106
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:14,458
I want you to put this money in the
Dayton Radisson parking ramp, top level,

1107
01:08:14,502 --> 01:08:16,203
30 minutes, Jerry, we wrap this thing up.

1108
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:17,171
Okay.
But...

1109
01:08:17,255 --> 01:08:19,506
Hey, you're there in 30
minutes or I find you, Jerry,

1110
01:08:19,591 --> 01:08:21,449
and I shoot you and I
shoot your fucking wife,

1111
01:08:21,534 --> 01:08:23,326
and I shoot all your
little fucking children

1112
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:26,412
and I shoot them all in the back of
their little fucking heads. You got it?

1113
01:08:26,496 --> 01:08:28,189
Okay, now, you stay away from Scotty, now.

1114
01:08:28,273 --> 01:08:28,815
Got it?

1115
01:08:28,899 --> 01:08:30,525
Okay.
Real good, then.

1116
01:08:54,793 --> 01:08:56,001
Dad.

1117
01:08:56,628 --> 01:08:58,003
It's okay, Scotty.

1118
01:08:58,087 --> 01:08:59,755
Where you going?

1119
01:09:00,089 --> 01:09:02,174
I'll be back in a minute.

1120
01:09:02,425 --> 01:09:06,762
If Stan calls, you just
tell him I went to Embers.

1121
01:09:09,098 --> 01:09:10,182
Okay.

1122
01:09:10,892 --> 01:09:12,851
Here's your damn money.

1123
01:09:13,645 --> 01:09:15,646
Now, where's my daughter?

1124
01:09:16,272 --> 01:09:17,397
Yeah.

1125
01:09:17,816 --> 01:09:20,692
You goddamn punk!

1126
01:09:37,043 --> 01:09:38,836
Who the fuck are you?

1127
01:09:41,714 --> 01:09:43,465
Who the fuck are you?

1128
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:46,593
I got your damn money.
Now, where's my daughter?

1129
01:09:47,554 --> 01:09:49,179
I am through fucking around!

1130
01:09:49,264 --> 01:09:50,973
Drop that fucking briefcase!

1131
01:09:51,057 --> 01:09:52,641
Where's my daughter?

1132
01:09:52,725 --> 01:09:55,060
Fuck you, man!
Where's Jerry?

1133
01:09:55,144 --> 01:09:57,479
I gave simple fucking instructions.

1134
01:09:57,564 --> 01:09:59,273
Where's my damn daughter?

1135
01:09:59,357 --> 01:10:00,649
No Jean, no money.

1136
01:10:00,733 --> 01:10:02,651
Drop that fucking money!

1137
01:10:02,735 --> 01:10:04,403
No Jean, no money!

1138
01:10:06,197 --> 01:10:08,198
Is this a fucking joke here?

1139
01:10:14,706 --> 01:10:18,166
Oh, jeez.

1140
01:10:18,251 --> 01:10:20,335
You happy now, asshole?

1141
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:22,087
What's with you people?

1142
01:10:22,171 --> 01:10:24,047
You fucking imbeciles!

1143
01:10:31,890 --> 01:10:34,016
You fucking shot me!

1144
01:11:51,135 --> 01:11:53,220
May I have your ticket, please?

1145
01:11:53,304 --> 01:11:55,013
Open the fucking gate!

1146
01:12:34,554 --> 01:12:36,013
Oh, jeez.

1147
01:13:06,252 --> 01:13:07,335
Dad?

1148
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:08,503
Yeah?

1149
01:13:08,963 --> 01:13:10,756
Stan Grossman called.

1150
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:12,382
Yeah.
Okay.

1151
01:13:12,467 --> 01:13:13,467
Twice.

1152
01:13:13,593 --> 01:13:14,593
Okay.

1153
01:13:16,596 --> 01:13:18,305
Is everything okay?

1154
01:13:18,681 --> 01:13:19,806
Yeah.

1155
01:13:21,601 --> 01:13:23,351
Are you calling Stan?

1156
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,105
Well, I'm...

1157
01:13:28,649 --> 01:13:30,484
I'm going to bed now.

1158
01:14:07,355 --> 01:14:08,522
How you doing?

1159
01:14:08,606 --> 01:14:10,232
Mr. Mohra?
Yeah?

1160
01:14:10,566 --> 01:14:11,733
Officer Olson.

1161
01:14:11,818 --> 01:14:13,318
Yeah.
Righto.

1162
01:14:14,153 --> 01:14:15,362
Well...

1163
01:14:15,446 --> 01:14:18,615
So I'm tending bar down there at
Ecklund and Swedlin's last Tuesday,

1164
01:14:18,699 --> 01:14:20,408
and this little guy's drinking,

1165
01:14:20,493 --> 01:14:22,536
and he says:
"Where can a guy find some action?

1166
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:24,871
"I'm going crazy out there at the lake."

1167
01:14:24,956 --> 01:14:26,414
And I says:
"What kind of action?"

1168
01:14:26,499 --> 01:14:28,708
And he says: "Woman action.
What do I look like?"

1169
01:14:28,793 --> 01:14:30,373
And I says:
"Well, what do I look like?

1170
01:14:30,436 --> 01:14:32,462
"I don't arrange that kind of thing."

1171
01:14:32,547 --> 01:14:35,090
And he says: "But I'm going
crazy out there at the lake."

1172
01:14:35,174 --> 01:14:38,426
And I says:
"Yeah, but this ain't that kind of place."

1173
01:14:38,511 --> 01:14:41,972
He says: "Oh, so I get it. So you think
I'm some kind of jerk for asking."

1174
01:14:42,056 --> 01:14:43,598
Only he don't use the word "jerk".

1175
01:14:43,683 --> 01:14:45,267
I understand.
Then he calls me a jerk,

1176
01:14:45,351 --> 01:14:47,769
says the last guy thought
he's a jerk is dead now.

1177
01:14:47,854 --> 01:14:49,437
So, I don't say nothing.

1178
01:14:49,522 --> 01:14:51,439
He says:
"What do you think about that?"

1179
01:14:51,524 --> 01:14:54,943
And I says, "Well, that don't sound
like too good a deal for him, then."

1180
01:14:55,027 --> 01:14:56,069
You got that right.

1181
01:14:56,154 --> 01:14:57,904
Yeah, he says:
"Yeah, that guy's dead,

1182
01:14:57,989 --> 01:14:59,447
"and I don't mean of old age."

1183
01:14:59,532 --> 01:15:03,076
And then he says, "Jeez, I'm going
crazy out there at the lake."

1184
01:15:03,161 --> 01:15:04,161
White Bear Lake?

1185
01:15:04,245 --> 01:15:06,765
Yeah, well, at Ecklund and Swedlin,
that's closer to Moose Lake.

1186
01:15:06,789 --> 01:15:07,956
So I made that assumption.

1187
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:08,999
Sure.

1188
01:15:09,083 --> 01:15:10,876
Anyway, he's drinking at the bar,

1189
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,669
so I don't think a whole great deal of it,

1190
01:15:12,753 --> 01:15:15,797
but then Mrs. Mohra, she heard
about the homicides down here

1191
01:15:15,882 --> 01:15:20,010
and thought I should call
it in, so I called it in.

1192
01:15:22,263 --> 01:15:23,805
End of story.

1193
01:15:24,432 --> 01:15:26,091
Well, what'd this guy look like, anyways?

1194
01:15:26,175 --> 01:15:27,659
He's a...

1195
01:15:27,685 --> 01:15:29,269
Little guy, kind of funny-looking.

1196
01:15:30,229 --> 01:15:31,605
In what way?

1197
01:15:31,689 --> 01:15:33,648
Just in a general kind of way.

1198
01:15:33,733 --> 01:15:36,318
Okay.
Well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra.

1199
01:15:36,402 --> 01:15:38,111
You're right.
It's probably nothing,

1200
01:15:38,196 --> 01:15:39,396
but thanks for calling her in.

1201
01:15:39,447 --> 01:15:40,697
Sure.

1202
01:15:40,781 --> 01:15:43,366
Looks like she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.

1203
01:15:43,451 --> 01:15:45,744
Oh, yeah.
Got a front coming in.

1204
01:15:45,912 --> 01:15:48,121
Yeah.
You got that right.

1205
01:16:07,475 --> 01:16:08,892
Jesus Christ.

1206
01:18:25,571 --> 01:18:28,990
Valerie, I'm leaving this
morning, back up to Brainerd.

1207
01:18:29,075 --> 01:18:31,493
Well, I'm sorry I won't see you.

1208
01:18:31,744 --> 01:18:32,994
But you think he's all right?

1209
01:18:33,079 --> 01:18:34,204
I saw him last night and...

1210
01:18:34,288 --> 01:18:35,330
What did he say?

1211
01:18:35,414 --> 01:18:37,123
Well, it's nothing specific he said.

1212
01:18:37,208 --> 01:18:40,377
It just seemed like it all hit
him really hard, his wife dying.

1213
01:18:40,461 --> 01:18:42,337
His wife?
Linda.

1214
01:18:42,463 --> 01:18:44,464
Who?
Linda Cooksey.

1215
01:18:44,548 --> 01:18:46,341
No. No, no.
They weren't...

1216
01:18:46,425 --> 01:18:49,344
He was bothering Linda for about...
For a good year.

1217
01:18:49,428 --> 01:18:52,555
Really pestering her,
wouldn't leave her alone.

1218
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:54,140
So...

1219
01:18:54,683 --> 01:18:56,142
He didn't...

1220
01:18:56,685 --> 01:18:57,685
He never...

1221
01:18:57,770 --> 01:18:59,479
No!
No, they never married.

1222
01:18:59,563 --> 01:19:02,023
Mike's had psychiatric problems.

1223
01:19:02,108 --> 01:19:03,525
Oh, my.

1224
01:19:03,609 --> 01:19:05,110
Yeah, he's been struggling.

1225
01:19:05,194 --> 01:19:07,529
He's living with his parents now.

1226
01:19:08,697 --> 01:19:10,031
Oh, jeez.

1227
01:19:10,116 --> 01:19:12,534
Linda's fine.
You should call her.

1228
01:19:12,618 --> 01:19:14,160
Jeez.
Well...

1229
01:19:14,787 --> 01:19:15,912
Jeez.

1230
01:19:17,623 --> 01:19:19,290
That's a surprise.

1231
01:19:29,343 --> 01:19:30,510
Hello!

1232
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:14,471
Mr. Lundegaard, sorry to bother you again.
Can I come in?

1233
01:20:14,555 --> 01:20:17,599
Yeah... No.
I'm kind of busy here.

1234
01:20:17,683 --> 01:20:20,185
I understand.
I'll keep it real short, then.

1235
01:20:20,269 --> 01:20:23,104
I'm on my way out of town,
but I was wondering...

1236
01:20:23,189 --> 01:20:24,397
Do you mind if I sit down?

1237
01:20:24,482 --> 01:20:25,682
Carrying a bit of a load here.

1238
01:20:25,691 --> 01:20:26,816
No, I...

1239
01:20:26,901 --> 01:20:28,810
Yeah, it's this vehicle
I asked about yesterday.

1240
01:20:28,894 --> 01:20:29,836
I was just wondering...

1241
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:32,947
Yeah, like I told you, we haven't
had any vehicles go missing.

1242
01:20:33,032 --> 01:20:35,074
Okay.
Are you sure?

1243
01:20:36,076 --> 01:20:38,495
'Cause I mean, how do you know?

1244
01:20:38,579 --> 01:20:40,259
Because, see, the crime I'm investigating,

1245
01:20:40,331 --> 01:20:42,499
the perpetrators were driving
a car with dealer plates,

1246
01:20:42,583 --> 01:20:44,233
and they called someone who works here,

1247
01:20:44,318 --> 01:20:46,185
so it'd be quite a
coincidence if they weren't,

1248
01:20:46,269 --> 01:20:48,062
you know, connected.

1249
01:20:48,088 --> 01:20:49,506
Yeah, I see.

1250
01:20:49,673 --> 01:20:51,007
So, how do you...

1251
01:20:51,091 --> 01:20:53,218
Have you done any kind
of inventory recently?

1252
01:20:53,302 --> 01:20:54,969
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.

1253
01:20:55,054 --> 01:20:57,138
But how do you know that for
sure without doing a...

1254
01:20:57,223 --> 01:20:58,890
Well, I would know.

1255
01:20:59,058 --> 01:21:00,725
I'm the Executive Sales Manager.

1256
01:21:00,809 --> 01:21:02,519
Yeah, but I understand...

1257
01:21:02,603 --> 01:21:04,145
We run a pretty tight ship here.

1258
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:05,230
I know, but...

1259
01:21:05,314 --> 01:21:07,357
Well, how do they establish that, sir?

1260
01:21:07,441 --> 01:21:08,858
I mean, are the cars counted daily,

1261
01:21:08,943 --> 01:21:10,818
or what kind of a routine here?

1262
01:21:10,903 --> 01:21:13,363
Ma'am, I answered your question.

1263
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:18,701
I'm sorry, sir?

1264
01:21:18,786 --> 01:21:21,079
Ma'am, I answered your question.

1265
01:21:21,747 --> 01:21:22,830
I answered the darn...

1266
01:21:22,915 --> 01:21:26,167
I'm cooperating here, and there's no...

1267
01:21:29,838 --> 01:21:32,674
Sir, you have no call
to get snippy with me.

1268
01:21:32,758 --> 01:21:34,300
I'm just doing my job here.

1269
01:21:34,385 --> 01:21:35,552
I'm...

1270
01:21:37,221 --> 01:21:40,473
I'm not...
I'm not arguing here.

1271
01:21:40,558 --> 01:21:42,934
I'm cooperating, and there's no...

1272
01:21:43,018 --> 01:21:45,103
We're doing all we can.

1273
01:21:51,819 --> 01:21:54,612
Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson?

1274
01:21:58,617 --> 01:22:00,118
Mr. Lundegaard.

1275
01:22:03,330 --> 01:22:06,749
Well, heck! If you wanna...
If you wanna play games here,

1276
01:22:06,834 --> 01:22:09,502
I'm working with you
on this thing here, but...

1277
01:22:09,587 --> 01:22:12,505
Okay!
I'll do a damn lot count!

1278
01:22:12,590 --> 01:22:13,673
Sir, right now?

1279
01:22:13,757 --> 01:22:15,341
Yeah!
Right now.

1280
01:22:16,010 --> 01:22:17,802
You're darn tooting!

1281
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:21,681
If it's so damned important to you.

1282
01:22:22,308 --> 01:22:24,017
Well, I'm sorry, sir.

1283
01:22:24,101 --> 01:22:26,311
What the Christ!
Jeez!

1284
01:22:39,825 --> 01:22:42,660
Bob Elcorona, line two.

1285
01:23:11,065 --> 01:23:12,857
For Pete's sake.

1286
01:23:16,528 --> 01:23:18,446
For Pete's sake,
he's fleeing the interview.

1287
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:20,698
He's fleeing the interview!

1288
01:23:22,034 --> 01:23:24,452
How do I get an outside line here?

1289
01:23:26,288 --> 01:23:27,538
All right.

1290
01:23:30,793 --> 01:23:33,086
Yeah.
Detective Sibert, please.

1291
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:37,561
I told you it was over, and I
thought I made myself very clear.

1292
01:23:37,633 --> 01:23:40,426
You did.
You made yourself perfectly clear.

1293
01:23:40,511 --> 01:23:42,387
But something's come up.

1294
01:23:42,846 --> 01:23:43,930
What?

1295
01:23:44,223 --> 01:23:45,623
Well, it's something kind of small,

1296
01:23:45,641 --> 01:23:47,850
but it might be a big problem.

1297
01:23:47,976 --> 01:23:49,477
I'm pregnant.

1298
01:23:51,063 --> 01:23:52,563
I'm pregnant.

1299
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,984
I've had a doctor's test,
I've got the certificate,

1300
01:23:57,069 --> 01:24:00,571
and there's no doubt about it,
I'm gonna have your baby.

1301
01:24:03,242 --> 01:24:05,702
Now, look here.
I can explain this.

1302
01:24:05,869 --> 01:24:09,247
See, Robin was...
Is a student of mine.

1303
01:24:10,165 --> 01:24:12,417
You should see the other guy.

1304
01:24:13,001 --> 01:24:14,877
No, no, no.
It wasn't anything like that.

1305
01:24:14,962 --> 01:24:16,087
You don't understand!

1306
01:24:16,171 --> 01:24:17,922
I read that letter that she wrote.

1307
01:24:18,006 --> 01:24:19,590
I think I understand all there is...

1308
01:24:19,675 --> 01:24:21,426
What happened to her?

1309
01:24:22,761 --> 01:24:25,388
She started shrieking, you know.

1310
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:26,597
Jeez.

1311
01:24:27,349 --> 01:24:29,434
Well, I got the money.

1312
01:24:29,935 --> 01:24:32,603
All of it, all 80 grand.

1313
01:24:34,773 --> 01:24:37,483
That's 40 for you, 40 for me.

1314
01:24:39,570 --> 01:24:41,154
That's it, then.

1315
01:24:45,909 --> 01:24:47,410
You can have my truck.

1316
01:24:47,536 --> 01:24:49,036
I'm taking the Cierra.

1317
01:24:49,121 --> 01:24:50,621
We split that.

1318
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:56,002
How the fuck do you split
a fucking car, you dummy?

1319
01:24:56,295 --> 01:24:58,296
With a fucking chain saw?

1320
01:24:58,547 --> 01:25:01,215
One of us pays the other for half.

1321
01:25:01,467 --> 01:25:03,968
Hold on.
No fucking way.

1322
01:25:04,845 --> 01:25:06,971
Did you fucking notice this?

1323
01:25:07,806 --> 01:25:09,515
I got fucking shot!

1324
01:25:09,892 --> 01:25:12,143
I got fucking shot in the face!

1325
01:25:12,227 --> 01:25:13,770
I went and got the fucking money!

1326
01:25:13,854 --> 01:25:15,605
I got shot fucking picking it up!

1327
01:25:15,689 --> 01:25:18,399
I've been up for 36 fucking hours!

1328
01:25:19,735 --> 01:25:21,194
I'm taking that fucking car!

1329
01:25:21,278 --> 01:25:24,614
That fuck is mine, you fucking asshole.

1330
01:25:24,823 --> 01:25:28,117
You know, I've been listening to
your fucking bullshit all week!

1331
01:25:28,243 --> 01:25:29,744
Are we square?

1332
01:25:31,830 --> 01:25:33,623
Are we square?

1333
01:25:35,667 --> 01:25:37,543
Yeah, you fucking mute!

1334
01:25:39,630 --> 01:25:41,547
And if you see your friend, Shep Proudfoot,

1335
01:25:41,632 --> 01:25:44,091
tell him I'm gonna nail his fucking ass.

1336
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:48,471
I'll call you... Later.

1337
01:26:00,150 --> 01:26:03,361
His wife. This guy says
she was kidnapped last Wednesday.

1338
01:26:03,445 --> 01:26:04,904
The day of our homicides.

1339
01:26:04,988 --> 01:26:06,072
Yeah.

1340
01:26:06,156 --> 01:26:07,448
And this guy was who?

1341
01:26:07,533 --> 01:26:10,159
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.

1342
01:26:10,244 --> 01:26:11,911
Gustafson's accountant.

1343
01:26:11,995 --> 01:26:13,120
Yeah.

1344
01:26:13,205 --> 01:26:14,872
But we still haven't found Gustafson?

1345
01:26:14,957 --> 01:26:16,666
...looking...

1346
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:18,459
Sorry.
Didn't copy, Lou.

1347
01:26:18,544 --> 01:26:20,127
Still missing.
We're looking.

1348
01:26:20,212 --> 01:26:22,213
Copy.
And Lundegaard, too?

1349
01:26:22,422 --> 01:26:24,841
Yeah.
Where are you, Margie?

1350
01:26:24,925 --> 01:26:26,092
I'm almost back.

1351
01:26:26,176 --> 01:26:27,718
I'm taking a drive around Moose Lake.

1352
01:26:27,803 --> 01:26:29,804
Gary's loudmouth.

1353
01:26:30,097 --> 01:26:31,472
Yeah, the loudmouth.

1354
01:26:31,557 --> 01:26:33,140
So the whole state has it?

1355
01:26:33,225 --> 01:26:35,059
Gustafson and Lundegaard?

1356
01:26:35,143 --> 01:26:36,435
Yeah.
It's over the wire.

1357
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:37,895
It's everywhere.
They'll find them.

1358
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:39,105
Copy.

1359
01:26:39,565 --> 01:26:40,765
Yeah, we got a lead on this...

1360
01:26:40,774 --> 01:26:42,149
There's the car!
There's the car!

1361
01:26:42,234 --> 01:26:43,234
Whose car?

1362
01:26:43,318 --> 01:26:46,654
My car! My car!
Tan Cierra! Tan Cierra!

1363
01:26:47,239 --> 01:26:50,241
Okay. Careful, Margie.
I'll send a couple cars.

1364
01:28:43,730 --> 01:28:44,939
Police!

1365
01:28:52,698 --> 01:28:54,281
Hands up!

1366
01:28:54,574 --> 01:28:55,783
Police!

1367
01:28:59,079 --> 01:29:00,371
Police!

1368
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:03,601
So that was Mrs. Lundegaard
on the floor in there.

1369
01:30:08,690 --> 01:30:12,234
And I guess that was your
accomplice in the wood chipper.

1370
01:30:16,907 --> 01:30:19,325
And those three people in Brainerd.

1371
01:30:24,706 --> 01:30:26,165
And for what?

1372
01:30:27,375 --> 01:30:29,418
For a little bit of money.

1373
01:30:34,966 --> 01:30:38,219
There's more to life than
a little money, you know?

1374
01:30:47,854 --> 01:30:49,647
Don't you know that?

1375
01:30:56,029 --> 01:30:57,780
And here you are.

1376
01:30:58,990 --> 01:31:00,950
And it's a beautiful day.

1377
01:31:10,293 --> 01:31:11,502
Well...

1378
01:31:24,349 --> 01:31:26,433
I just don't understand it.

1379
01:32:08,768 --> 01:32:10,227
Mr. Anderson?

1380
01:32:11,563 --> 01:32:12,813
Who?

1381
01:32:12,898 --> 01:32:16,317
Mr. Anderson, is this your
burgundy '98 out here?

1382
01:32:17,736 --> 01:32:19,195
Just a sec.

1383
01:32:19,279 --> 01:32:20,988
Could you open the door, please?

1384
01:32:21,072 --> 01:32:22,990
Yeah, yeah, just a sec.

1385
01:32:23,491 --> 01:32:24,867
Just a sec.

1386
01:32:32,417 --> 01:32:34,376
- Dale!
- My leg!

1387
01:32:34,461 --> 01:32:35,669
No!

1388
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,627
They announced it.

1389
01:33:18,213 --> 01:33:19,630
They announced it?

1390
01:33:19,714 --> 01:33:20,839
Yeah.

1391
01:33:21,341 --> 01:33:22,383
So?

1392
01:33:23,385 --> 01:33:25,010
Three-cent stamp.

1393
01:33:25,762 --> 01:33:27,221
Your mallard?

1394
01:33:27,472 --> 01:33:28,514
Yeah.

1395
01:33:29,391 --> 01:33:31,225
That's terrific.

1396
01:33:31,309 --> 01:33:33,269
It's just a three-cent.

1397
01:33:33,812 --> 01:33:34,895
It's terrific.

1398
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:37,690
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the 29-cent.

1399
01:33:38,316 --> 01:33:40,442
People don't much use the three-cent.

1400
01:33:40,527 --> 01:33:43,112
For Pete's...
Of course they do.

1401
01:33:44,322 --> 01:33:45,781
Whenever they raise the postage,

1402
01:33:45,865 --> 01:33:47,741
people need the little stamps.

1403
01:33:48,201 --> 01:33:49,576
Yeah?

1404
01:33:49,661 --> 01:33:52,663
When they're stuck with a
bunch of the old ones.

1405
01:33:52,747 --> 01:33:53,998
Yeah.

1406
01:33:54,749 --> 01:33:56,125
I guess.

1407
01:33:57,627 --> 01:34:00,754
That's terrific.
I'm so proud of you, Norm.

1408
01:34:04,301 --> 01:34:07,303
Heck, Norm, you know,
we're doing pretty good.

1409
01:34:09,848 --> 01:34:11,640
I love you, Margie.

1410
01:34:12,684 --> 01:34:14,310
I love you, Norm.

1411
01:34:17,522 --> 01:34:19,148
Two more months.
