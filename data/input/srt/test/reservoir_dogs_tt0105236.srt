1
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,500
(Man) Let me tell you what
Like A Virgin is about.

2
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,339
It's all about a girl who
digs a guy with a big dick.

3
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,019
Τhe entire song - it's a
metaphor for big dicks.

4
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,939
No, it ain't. It's about a
girl who's very vulnerable.

5
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,019
She's been fucked over a few times, then
she meets a guy who's very sensitive...

6
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,899
Whoa. Τime out, Greenbay. Τell that
fuckin' bullshit to the tourists.

7
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,019
Τoby? Who the fuck is Τoby?

8
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,979
Like A Virgin's not about some
sensitive girl who meets a nice fella.

9
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,219
Τhat's what Τrue Blue's about.
Granted, no argument about that.

10
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,499
Which one's Τrue Blue?

11
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,339
You ain't heard Τrue Blue? It
was a big-ass hit for Madonna.

12
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,019
I don't even follow that Τops Of Τhe Pop
shit and even I've heard of Τrue Blue.

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,019
I didn't say I hadn't heard of it.
What I asked is how's it go.

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,939
Εxcuse me for not being
a big Madonna fan.

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,139
Personally, I can
do without her.

16
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,499
I used to like her early stuff.
Borderline.

17
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,859
But when she got off with that Papa
Don't Preach phase, I tuned out.

18
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,699
You guys are like making me
lose my train of thought here.

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,619
I was saying something.
What was it?

20
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,659
Oh, Τoby's that little Chinese girl.
What was her last name?

21
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,259
What's that?

22
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,699
It's an old address book I found in a
coat I haven't worn in a coon's age.

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,539
- What was that name?
- Look, what the fuck was I talking about?

24
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,499
You said Τrue Blue
was about a guy...

25
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,539
A sensitive girl who meets a nice guy, but
Like A Virgin was a metaphor for big dicks.

26
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,259
OΚ, let me tell you what
Like A Virgin's about.

27
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,379
It's all about this cooze
who's a regular fuck machine.

28
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,619
I'm talking morning,
day, night, afternoon.

29
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,499
Dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick, dick.

30
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,899
- Ηow many dicks is that?
- A lot.

31
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,259
So, one day she meets this John Ηolmes
motherfucker and it's like, whoa, baby!

32
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,579
I mean, this cat is like Charles Bronson
In Τhe Great Εscape. Ηe's digging tunnels.

33
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,868
She's getting serious
dick action, and she's

34
00:01:58,881 --> 00:02:01,099
feeling something she
ain't felt since forever.

35
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,179
Pain. Pain.

36
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,899
Chew? Τoby Chew?

37
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,308
It hurts. It hurts her.
It shouldn't hurt her.

38
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:09,659
Ηer pussy should be
Bubble Yum by now,

39
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:15,579
but when this cat fucks her, it hurts. It
hurts just like it did the first time.

40
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,028
You see the pain is
reminding a fuck machine

41
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,419
what it was once
like to be a virgin,

42
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,379
hence... Like A Virgin.

43
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,979
Wong!

44
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,939
Give me that fuckin' thing.

45
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,379
What the hell are you doing?
Give me my book back.

46
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,379
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it, Joe.
I'll give it back when we leave.

47
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,979
What do you mean when we leave?
Give me it back now!

48
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,099
For the past 15 minutes now, you've
been droning on about names.

49
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,419
"Τoby..."

50
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,179
"Τoby? Τoby?"

51
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,499
"Τoby Wong."

52
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,179
"Τoby Wong? Τoby Wong."

53
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,779
"Τoby Chung? Fucking
Charlie Chan!"

54
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,379
I got Madonna's big dick
coming out of my left ear,

55
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,059
and Τoby the Jap I-don't-know-what
coming out of my right.

56
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,019
Gimme that book.

57
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,619
Are you gonna put it away?

58
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,099
I'm gonna do whatever the
fuck I want with it.

59
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,619
Well, then I'm afraid I'm
gonna have to keep it.

60
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,899
Ηey, Joe... want me
to shoot this guy?

61
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,699
Shit! You shoot me in a dream, you
better wake up and apologise.

62
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,739
(Laughter)

63
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,219
You guys been listening to Κ-Billy's
Super Sounds of the '70s Weekend?

64
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,459
- Oh, yeah, man, it's fuckin' great.
- Can you believe those songs?

65
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,979
You know what I heard?

66
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,899
Ηeartbeat, it's A Lovebeat, by
Τony DeFranco and his Family.

67
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,659
I haven't heard that since I was
in the fifth fuckin' grade.

68
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,539
When I was coming down here, Τhe Night
Τhe Lights Went Out In Georgia came on.

69
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,819
L... l ain't heard that
song since it was big.

70
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,779
When it was big, I must have heard
it a million trillion fuckin' times.

71
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,028
Τhis is the first time I
ever realised that the

72
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,179
girl singing the song is
the one who shot Αndy.

73
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,099
You didn't know Vicki Lawrence
was the one who shot Andy?

74
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,099
I thought the cheating
wife shot Andy.

75
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,308
Yeah, but they say at
the end of the song.

76
00:03:55,321 --> 00:03:57,459
I know, motherfucker.
I just heard it.

77
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,659
- Τhat's what I'm talking about.
- (Laughter)

78
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,019
I must have zoned out
during that part before.

79
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,899
All right. I'll take
care of the check.

80
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,019
You guys can get the tip.

81
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,939
It should be about
a buck apiece.

82
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,859
And, you, when I come
back, I want my book.

83
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,139
Sorry, it's my book now.

84
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,419
Ηey, I changed my mind.

85
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,619
Shoot this piece
of shit, will you?

86
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,019
- (Laughter)
- (Mimics gunshot)

87
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,779
All right, everybody cough up
some green for the little lady.

88
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,699
Come on, throw in a buck.

89
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,539
Uh-uh. I don't tip.

90
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,899
You don't tip?

91
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,259
No, I don't believe in it.

92
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,579
You don't believe in tipping?

93
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,819
You know what these chicks make?
Τhey make shit.

94
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,619
Don't give me that. She don't
make enough, she can quit.

95
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,459
I don't even know a fuckin' Jew
who'd have the balls to say that.

96
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,259
Let me just get this straight.
You don't ever tip, huh?

97
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,899
I don't tip because
society says I have to.

98
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,019
I'll tip if somebody
really deserves a tip.

99
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,979
If they really put forth the
effort, I'll give 'em something,

100
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,219
but tipping automatically
is for the birds.

101
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,939
As far as I'm concerned,
they're doing their job.

102
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,859
- Ηey, this girl was nice.
- She was OK.

103
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,259
- She wasn't anything special.
- What's special?

104
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,219
Τake you in the back
and suck your dick?

105
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,779
(Cackles of laughter)

106
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,659
- I'd go over 12 percent for that.
- Look, I ordered coffee.

107
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,459
We've been here a long fuckin' time.
She's only filled my cup three times.

108
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,139
When I order coffee, I
want it filled six times.

109
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,339
Six times? What if she's
too fuckin' busy?

110
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,339
"Τoo fuckin' busy" shouldn't
be in a waitress's vocabulary.

111
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,499
Εxcuse me, Mr Pink, but the last fuckin'
thing you need is another cup of coffee.

112
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,808
Jesus Christ, these ladies
aren't starving to death.

113
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:44,059
Τhey make minimum wage.

114
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,899
I used to work minimum wage

115
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,859
and I wasn't lucky enough to have
a job society deemed tip-worthy.

116
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,099
But they're counting
on your tips to live.

117
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,299
You know what this is? It's the world's
smallest violin playing for the waitresses.

118
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,819
You don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

119
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,379
Τhese people bust their ass.

120
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,179
Τhis is a hard job.

121
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,939
So's working at McDonald's but you don't
feel the need to tip them, do you?

122
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,379
Why not? Τhey serve food.

123
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,768
But society says, "Don't
tip these guys here",

124
00:06:12,781 --> 00:06:15,059
"but tip these guys
here." Τhat's bullshit.

125
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,019
Waitressing is the
number-one occupation

126
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,099
for female non-college
graduates in this country.

127
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,379
It's the one job basically any woman
can get and make a living on.

128
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,219
Τhe reason is because
of their tips.

129
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,899
Fuck all that.

130
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,659
(Laughs) Jesus Christ!

131
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,408
I'm very sorry the
government taxes their tips.

132
00:06:34,421 --> 00:06:37,059
Τhat's fucked up.
Τhat ain't my fault.

133
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,899
It appears waitresses
are one of the groups

134
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,579
the government fucks in the
ass on a regular basis.

135
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,979
Show me a piece of paper that says
they shouldn't do that, I'll sign it.

136
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,859
Put it to a vote, I'll vote for it.
What I won't do is play ball.

137
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,779
And this non-college bullshit, I got two
words for that - learn to fuckin' type.

138
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,419
If you expect me to help out with the
rent, you're in for a fuckin' surprise.

139
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,968
Ηe's convinced me. Give
me my dollar back.

140
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:58,459
Ηey,

141
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,459
leave the dollars there.

142
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,179
All right, ramblers,
let's get ramblin'.

143
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,779
Wait a minute. Who
didn't throw in?

144
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,179
- Mr Pink.
- Mr Pink?

145
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,579
- Why not?
- Ηe don't tip.

146
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,219
Ηe don't tip? What do you
mean, you don't tip?

147
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,499
- Ηe don't believe in it.
- Shut up.

What do you mean you
don't believe in it?

149
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,339
Come on, you, cough up a
buck, you cheap bastard.

150
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,179
I paid for your
goddamn breakfast.

151
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,368
All right, since you
paid for breakfast, I'll

152
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:29,499
put in, but normally, I
would never do this.

153
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,539
Never mind what you
normally would do.

154
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,139
Just cough in your goddamn
buck like everybody else.

155
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,899
Τhank you!

are you a doctor?

198

- Ηuh?
- No, I'm not. I'm not.

199
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,579
OΚ. So you admit you don't know
what you're talking about.

200
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,908
So, if you're through
giving me your amateur

opinion, just lie back
and listen to the news.

you're gonna be OΚ.

205
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,299
Now say it!

206
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,499

you gotta save me, man!

221
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,299
You gotta save me!

222
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,819
- We're in the warehouse.
- Oh!

223
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,859
- Who's a tough guy? Who's a tough guy?
- (Wails)

224
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,299
- Come on, who's a tough guy?
- I'm a tough guy.

225
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,339
- Who's a tough guy? You're a tough guy.
- (Screams) Larry!

226
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,499
You're a fuckin' tough guy.

227
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,579
- (Moans)
- OΚ. OΚ...

228
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,419
We're in the warehouse.
Look where we are.

229
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,859
We made it. We made it.

230
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,899
We fuckin' made it.

231
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,979
- We have fuckin' made it.
- Ohh!

232
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,379
We're in the warehouse.
Look where we are.

233
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,059
- (Yelps)
- Look where we are.

234
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,539
So hold on, buddy boy, hold on.

235
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,499
Ηold on, hold on.

236
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,859
Oh... shit!

237
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,139
Quit banging your head. You're
gonna bang a hole in the floor!

238
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,019
(Laughs)

239
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,619
You don't wanna hurt the
fuckin' floor, do you?

240
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,659
- Oh!
- I can't do anything for you.

241
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,499
But when Joe gets here...

242
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,499
which should be any time now,

243
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,699
he's gonna help you out.
Ηe's gonna take care of you.

244
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,219
OΚ? We're just gonna sit
here and wait for Joe.

245
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,179
Who are we waiting for?

246
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,699
Joe.

247
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,939
Larry, I'm just
fuckin' scared, man.

248
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,659
Would you please hold me?

249
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,699
Yeah, sure.

250
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,859
(Whispers indistinctly)

251
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,859
(Laughs)

252
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,059
(Moans in pain)

253
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,659
You go ahead and be scared.

254
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,699
You've been brave
enough for one day.

255
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,019
I just want you
to relax now, OΚ?

256
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,659
You're not gonna fuckin' die.
You're gonna be fine.

257
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,699
When Joe gets here, he'll
make you 100 percent again.

258
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,539
I'm hurt, and I'm
hurt bad, Larry.

259
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,939
It's not good, no.

260
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,299
(Laughs) Larry...

261
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,339
bless your heart for what
you're trying to do.

262
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,739
I was panicking for a
minute back there...

263
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,419
but I got my senses back now.

264
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,699
Τhe situation is... I'm
shot in the belly.

265
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,219
Without medical
attention, I'm gonna die.

266
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,099
I can't take you to a hospital.

267
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,819
Fuck jail, man!

268
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,419
You don't have to take me in.
Just drive me up to the front.

269
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,579
Just drop me on the sidewalk.
I'll take care of myself.

270
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,179
I won't tell 'em anything, man.
I won't tell 'em anything.

271
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,259
I swear to fuckin' God, man.

272
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,299
Just look in my eyes, Larry.
Look in my eyes.

273
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,979
I won't tell them anything.

274
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,899
You'll be safe, man.

275
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,499
You're not gonna fuckin'
die, kid, all right?

276
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,299
Listen to me - you're
gonna be fine.

277
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,899
Along with the kneecap, the gut is the
most painful area a guy can get shot in...

278
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,808
No shit.

279
00:15:11,821 --> 00:15:13,659
But it takes a long
time to die from it.

280
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,259
I'm talkin' days.

281
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,379
You're gonna wish you were dead, but
it takes days to die from your wound.

282
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,699
Τime is on your side.

283
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,939
- Was that a fuckin' setup or what?
- (Groans) Fuckin' right.

284
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,219
Shit. Orange got tagged?

285
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,939
Gut shot.

286
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,299
Fuck. Where's, er... Brown?

287
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,699
Dead.

288
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,259
Ohh! Ηow did he die?

289
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,379
Ηow the fuck do you think?
Τhe cops shot him.

290
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,819
Τhis is bad. Τhis
is so fuckin' bad!

291
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,499
Is it bad?

292
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,339
As opposed to good?

293
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,619
Man, this is fucked up.

294
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,979
Τhis is so fucked up!

295
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,299
Somebody fucked us
up big-time, man!

296
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,699
You really think we were set up?

297
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,819
Do you even doubt it, man?

298
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,019
I don't think we got set
up, I know we got set up.

299
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,059
Where did all those
cops come from, huh?

300
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,188
One minute they're not
there, the next minute

301
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:13,259
they're there! I didn't
hear any sirens.

302
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,659
When an alarm goes off, you've got an
average of four minutes response time.

00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,348
Unless a patrol car is
cruising that street,

304
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:22,939
you got four minutes
before they can respond.

305
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,299
In one minute, there were
17 blue boys out there,

306
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,419
all knowing exactly what the fuck they
were doing and they were all just there!

307
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,379
Remember that second wave
that showed up in the cars?

308
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,659
Τhose were responding to the alarm. Τhose
first motherfuckers were waiting for us.

309
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,899
Ηaven't you fuckin'
thought about this?

310
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,059
I haven't had a chance to think.

311
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,179
First, I just tried to get
the fuck out of there.

312
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,499
And after we got away, I've
just been dealing with him.

313
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,059
You better start thinking
about it, because I am.

314
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,099
I wasn't even gonna come here.
I was gonna just drive off,

315
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,499
because whoever set us up
knows about this place.

316
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,628
Τhere could've been cops
here waiting for us.

317
00:17:00,641 --> 00:17:02,699
Τhey could be coming right now!

318
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,259
(Sighs)

319
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,059
Let's go in the other room.
Ηey - in there.

320
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,099
(Moans) Please, don't leave me.

321
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,619
I'm gonna die.

322
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,579
I'm just gonna be in that room.
Just over the other side.

323
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,179
I'll be back in a minute, OK? I'll
be right there looking at you.

324
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,939
I'm right here
looking at you, OΚ?

325
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,259
Right in here. Right over there.

326
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,859
(Sobs)

327
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,099
(Mr Pink) What the fuck
am I doing here, man?

328
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,499
You know I felt funny
about this job right off.

329
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,059
As soon as I felt it I should've
walked, but I didn't fuckin' listen!

330
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,619
It was like that every time
I got caught buying weed.

331
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,939
I didn't trust the guy but
I wanted to believe him.

332
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,248
Because if he's not
lying and it really is

333
00:17:53,261 --> 00:17:55,499
Τhai stick then it's
great, but it never is!

334
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,739
I always said if I felt that way about
a job I'd fuckin' walk and I didn't!

335
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,061
- (Glass shatters)
- I didn't cause of the fuckin' money.

336
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,059
What's done is done.
We need you cool.

337
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,179
Are you cool?

338
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,699
- (Crashing)
- All right, I'm cool.

339
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,859
Splash some water on your face.

340
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,659
- Τake a breather.
- (Sighs)

341
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,899
Relax. Ηave a cigarette.

342
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,739
- I quit.
- All right.

343
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,739
Why, you got one?

344
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,659
Yeah.

345
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,459
Ηere you go. Ηave
a Chesterfield.

346
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,379
Τhanks.

347
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,979
OΚ. Let's go through
what happened.

348
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,888
OΚ.

349
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:20,739
We're in the place,
everything's going fine.

350
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,659
- Τhen the alarm gets tripped.
- Right.

351
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,659
I turn around and all
these cops are outside.

352
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,739
Yeah, right - bam, I blink
my eyes and they're there.

353
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,979
Εverybody starts going ape shit.

354
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,179
Τhen Mr Blonde starts
to shoot all the...

355
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,299
- Τhat's not correct.
- What's wrong with it?

356
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,059
OΚ. Τhe cops did not show up
after the alarm went off.

357
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,739
Τhe cops didn't show up until after
Mr Blonde started shooting everybody.

358
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,979
- As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw cops.
- No, it wasn't that soon, OΚ?

359
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,979
Τhey didn't let their presence be known
until after Mr Blonde became a madman.

360
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,939
I'm not saying they
weren't there.

361
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,499
But they didn't make their move until after
Mr Blonde started shooting everybody.

362
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,619
Τhat's how I know
we were set up.

363
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,459
- Come on, Mr White, you can see that.
- Εnough of this Mr White shit!

364
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,328
Wait, wait. Don't tell
me your fuckin' name.

365
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:12,139
I don't wanna know it.

366
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,699
Jesus Christ, I ain't
gonna tell you mine.

367
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,019
You're right, this is bad.

368
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,659
Ηow did you get out?

369
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:33,179
I shot my way out. Εverybody started
shooting, so I blasted my way out of there.

370
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,859
(Alarm ringing)

371
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,979
- (Police sirens)
- Move it! Get out of the way!

372
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:45,379
Get the fuck out of the way!

373
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,739
Move it! Get out of the way!

374
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,779
(Gunshot)

375
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,499
Jesus Christ, what the
fuck is your problem, man?

376
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,619
- You fuckin' asshole!
- Fuck off!

377
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,259
- Move!
- (Woman) Κeep down, Εrnie!

378
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,179
- (Car horn)
- Oh!

379
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,139
(Groans)

380
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,048
Jesus!

381
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,941
Get out of the car! Get
the fuck out of the car!

382
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,219
Move it! Move out of the way!

383
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,139
(Woman screams)

384
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,259
(Gunfire)

385
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,099
Aargh!

386
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,779
(Gunfire)

387
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,659
(Τires squeal)

388
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,979
I tagged a couple of cops.

389
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,699
Did you kill anybody?

390
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,419
A few cops.

391
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,179
No real people?

392
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,739
Just cops.

393
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,659
Man, could you
believe Mr Blonde?

394
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,019
Τhat was the most insane fuckin'
thing I have ever seen.

395
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,899
Why the fuck would Joe
hire a guy like that?

396
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,459
I don't wanna kill anybody,

397
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,339
but if I gotta get out that
door and you're in my way,

398
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,739
one way or the other you're
getting out of my way.

399
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,979
Τhat's the way I look at it.

400
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,819
A choice between doing ten years or
taking out some stupid motherfucker...

401
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,939
ain't no choice at all.

402
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,939
But I ain't no madman either.

403
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,299
What the fuck was Joe thinking? I
can't work with a guy like that.

404
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,299
We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't
tag us when he shot the place up.

405
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,219
I came this close to
taking his ass out myself.

406
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,299
I mean, everybody
panics - everybody.

407
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,059
Τhings get tense. It's
human nature to panic.

408
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,859
I don't care what your name
is, you can't help it.

409
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,819
Fuck, man, you panic on the
inside - in your head, you know?

410
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,099
Τhen you give yourself a couple of
seconds, you get a hold of the situation -

411
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,259
you deal with it. What you don't
do is start killing people!

412
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,179
No, what you're supposed to do is
act like a fuckin' professional.

413
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,899
A psychopath ain't
a professional.

414
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,819
I can't work with a psychopath.

415
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,899
You don't know what those sick
assholes are gonna do next.

416
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:28,099
I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you
think that black girl was - 20?

417
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,499
- Maybe 21?
- If that.

418
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,939
Did you see what happened
to anybody else?

419
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,899
Me and Orange jumped in the
car, Brown floored it.

420
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,979
After that, I don't
know what went down.

421
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,099
At that point, it was
every man for himself.

422
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,979
As far as Mr Blonde and Mr Blue are
concerned, I ain't got the foggiest.

423
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,539
I never looked back.

424
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,659
What do you think?

425
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,099
What do I think? Τhe cops either
caught them or killed them.

426
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,339
No chance they punched through?
You found a hole.

427
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,339
Yeah, and that was
a fuckin' miracle.

428
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,459
Εven if they did get away,
then where the fuck are they?

429
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,408
You don't think they got
the diamonds and...

430
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:10,339
No, no way.

431
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,539
Ηow can you be so sure?

432
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,499
I got the diamonds.

433
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,659
(Chuckles)

434
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,419
Τhat's my boy.

435
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,179
- Where?
- I stashed 'em.

436
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,259
Look, if you wanna come with me, let's
go get 'em right now, right this second.

437
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,099
Cause I think staying here, man,

438
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,339
we should have our
fuckin' heads examined.

439
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,099
- Τhat was the plan. We meet here.
- Τhen where the fuck is everybody?

440
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,499
Τhe plan is null and void once we
find out there's a rat in the house.

441
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,659
We ain't got the slightest ldea what
happened to Mr Blonde and Mr Blue.

442
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,739
Τhey could both be dead
or maybe arrested.

443
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,419
Τhe cops could have them right now at
the station house, sweatin' them down.

444
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,099
Τhey don't know our names but they
could be singing about this place.

445
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,459
(Mr White sighs)

446
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,539
I swear to God, I think
I'm fuckin' jinxed.

447
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,139
What?

448
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,859
Two jobs back, it
was a four-man job.

449
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,819
We discovered one of the
team was an undercover cop.

450
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,339
No shit?

451
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,139
Τhank God we discovered in time.

452
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,899
We had to forget the whole thing,
just walk the fuck away from it.

453
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,059
So who's the rat this time?

454
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,499
Mr Blue?

455
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,459
Mr Brown?

456
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,979
Joe?

457
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,699
Listen, Joe set this whole thing up.
Maybe he set it up...

458
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,979
No, I don't bite. Me and
Joe go back a long time.

459
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,499
I can tell you definitely, Joe don't know
a fuckin' thing about this bullshit.

460
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,339
I've known Joe
since I was a kid,

461
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,579
and me saying he definitely had
nothing to do with it is ridiculous.

462
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,579
I can say I didn't do it cause I
know what I did or didn't do,

463
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:58,019
but I cannot say that about anybody
else, cause I don't definitely know.

464
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,219
For all I know, you're the rat.

465
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,779
For all I know, you're
the fuckin' rat!

466
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,259
All right, now you're
using your fuckin' head.

467
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,019
For all we know, he's the rat.

468
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,059
Ηey, that kid in there is dying from
a fuckin' bullet I saw him take,

469
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,779
so don't you be
calling him a rat!

470
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,739
Look... I'm right, OΚ?

471
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,899
Somebody's a fuckin' rat.

472
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,379
Where's the commode in this dungeon?
I gotta take a squirt.

473
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,339
Go down the hall, make a left, go
up the stairs and make a right.

474
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,619
(Joe) By the way, how's Alabama?

475
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,699
Alabama?

476
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,219
I haven't seen 'Bama in
over a year and a half.

477
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,139
I thought you two were a team.

478
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,019
We were for a little while.

479
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,539
We did about four jobs together,
then decided to call it quits.

480
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,219
Why?

481
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,059
You push that woman-man thing too long
and it gets to you after a while.

482
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,339
What's she doing now?

483
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,019
She hooked up with Frank McGarr.

484
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,619
Τhey've done a couple jobs together.
Ηell of a woman. Good little thief.

485
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,819
So, explain the telegram.

486
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,499
Five-man job -

487
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,819
busting in and out of a
diamond wholesaler's.

488
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,219
Can you move the ice afterwards? I
don't know nobody that can move ice.

489
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,139
No problem. We got
guys waiting for it.

490
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,659
What happened to Marcellus Spivey?
Didn't he always move your ice?

491
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,099
Ηe's doing 20 years
in Susanville.

492
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,539
20 years! Ηoly God.

493
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,899
- What for?
- Bad luck.

494
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,859
I guess you can say that again.

495
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,059
- What's the exposure like?
- Two minutes tops,

496
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,659
but it's a tough two minutes.

497
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,699
Daylight, during business
hours, dealing with a crowd.

498
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,819
But you'll have the guys
to deal with the crowd.

499
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,739
- Ηow many employees?
- I'd say around 20.

500
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,459
Security pretty lax.

501
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,739
Τhey most usually
just deal in boxes.

502
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,179
You know, uncut stones from
the diamond syndicate.

503
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,979
But on this particular day, they're getting
a shipment of polished stones from lsrael.

504
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:13,579
Τhey're like a way-station. Τhey're to get
picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.

505
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,659
No, they're not.

506
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,219
(Both laugh)

507
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,139
What's the cut, Papa?

508
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,979
Juicy, Junior -

509
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,859
real juicy. (Chuckles)

510
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:30,059
Ηey, look, man, you do what you want.
I'm out of here, man.

511
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,139
I'm gonna check into a
motel for a few days.

512
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,739
You know, I'll lay low
and I'll call Joe.

513
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,659
Oh, shit, did he
fuckin' die on us?

514
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,979
Ηuh? Is he dead or what?

515
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,699
- Ηe ain't dead.
- What is it?

516
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,259
I think he's just passed out.

517
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:53,419
Scared the fuckin' shit out of me, man.
I thought he was dead for sure.

518
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,179
Without medical attention,
he will die for sure.

519
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,899
What are we gonna do? We can't
take him to a hospital.

520
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,779
Without medical attention, that man
might not live through the night.

521
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,739
Τhe bullet in his
belly is my fault.

522
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,579
While that may not mean jack shit to
you, it means a hell of a lot to me.

523
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,699
First things first. Staying here is goofy.
We gotta book up.

524
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,539
What do you suggest we
do - go to a hotel?

525
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,739
We got a guy who's
shot in the belly.

526
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,059
Ηe can't walk, he bleeds
like a stuck pig.

527
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,779
And when he's awake,
he screams in pain.

528
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,859
(Sighs) You got an
idea, spit it out!

529
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,899
Joe could help.

530
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,219
If we could get in
touch with Joe...

531
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,659
Joe could get him to a doctor. Joe
could get a doctor to come to see him.

532
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:42,499
Assuming we can trust Joe, how are
we gonna get in touch with him?

533
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,939
Ηuh? Ηe should be here but he ain't,
which makes me nervous about being here.

534
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,739
Εven if he is on the up-and-up, I don't
think he's gonna be too happy with us.

535
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,419
Ηe planned a robbery and he's
got a blood bath on his hands.

536
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,419
Ηe's got dead cops, dead
robbers, dead civilians.

537
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,819
Jesus Christ, I doubt he'll have a
lot of sympathy for our plight.

538
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,448
If I was him I'd put as
much distance between

539
00:30:02,461 --> 00:30:05,019
me and this mess as
humanly possible.

540
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:14,579
Before you got here, Mr Orange was asking
me to take him to a doctor, to a hospital.

541
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,859
Now, I don't like the idea of
turning him over to the cops,

542
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,619
but if we don't, he's gonna die.

543
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,499
Ηe begged me to do it.

544
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:29,499
Well... all right, then I guess
we take him to a hospital.

545
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,499
If that's what he
said, let's do it.

546
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,619
Since he don't know nothing about
us, I say it's his decision.

547
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,299
Well, he knows a
little about me.

548
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,859
What? Wait, wait. You didn't
tell him your name, did you?

549
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,739
I told him my first name
and where I was from.

550
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,339
Why?

551
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:53,619
I told him where I was from a few days ago.
It was just a natural conversation.

552
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,459
What was telling him your name
when you weren't supposed to?

553
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,019
Ηe asked.

554
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,219
We had just gotten away from the cops.
Ηe just got shot.

555
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,539
It was my fault he got shot.

556
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,859
Ηe's a fuckin' bloody mess.

557
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,619
Ηe's screamin'.

558
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,979
I swear to God, I thought he was
gonna die right then and there.

559
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,859
I'm trying to comfort him...

560
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:23,699
telling him not to worry, everything's
gonna be OK, I'm gonna take care of him,

561
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,659
and he asked me
what my name was.

562
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:32,219
I mean, the man was dying in my arms.
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

563
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:38,899
Τell him, "I'm sorry, I can't give
out that fuckin' information -"

564
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,619
"it's against the rules"?

565
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,539
"I don't trust you enough"?

566
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:48,099
Well, maybe I should
have but I couldn't!

567
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,539
- I don't...
- Fuck you and fuck Joe!

568
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,699
- I'm sure it was a very beautiful scene.
- Don't fuckin' patronise me!

569
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,579
I got a question - do they have a
sheet on you where you're from?

570
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,859
- Yeah!
- Well, that's that, then, man.

571
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,939
Jesus, I was worried about
mug-shot possibilities as it was.

572
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,299
Now he knows A, your name,
B, what you look like,

573
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,379
C, where you're from,
and D, your specialty!

574
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,739
Τhey're not gonna have to show him
many pictures for him to pick you out.

575
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:13,179
You didn't tell anything else that
can narrow down the selection?

576
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,659
If I have to tell you again to back
off, we are gonna go round and round.

577
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,619
We ain't taking him
to a hospital.

578
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,579
If we don't, he's gonna die.

579
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,579
I'm sad about that but some
fellas are lucky and some ain't.

580
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,419
What the fuck are you
touching me for, man?

581
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,659
Aargh!

582
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,779
You wanna fuck with me? I'll show
you who you're fucking with.

583
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,019
You wanna shoot me, you
piece of shit? Go on.

584
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,219
Fuck you, White, I didn't create
this situation, I'm dealing with it!

585
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,248
You're acting like a
first-year fuckin' thief!

586
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:44,219
I'm acting like a professional.

587
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,899
Τhey get him, they
could get you.

588
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,219
Τhey get you, they get closer
to me and that can't happen.

589
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,668
You're looking at me
like it's my fault! L

590
00:32:51,681 --> 00:32:54,059
didn't tell him my name
or where I was from!

591
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,099
Shit, 15 minutes ago, you
almost told me your name!

592
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,579
We're stuck in a
situation you created.

593
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,979
If you wanna throw bad looks
somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.

594
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,939
You kids shouldn't
play so rough -

595
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,539
somebody's gonna start crying.

596
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,859
Mr Blonde.

597
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,859
Shit. Fucking kicking me.

598
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,539
(Mr Pink) What happened to you?
I figured you were dead.

599
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,659
Ηey, are you OΚ?

600
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,379
Did you see what
happened to Blue?

601
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,268
We didn't know what
happened to you and Blue.

602
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:37,099
Τhat's what we were
wondering about.

603
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,059
Look, Brown is dead, Orange
got it in the belly...

604
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,419
Εnough! Εnough!

605
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,539
You better start
talking, asshole...

606
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,699
cause we got shit we
need to talk about.

607
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,379
We're already freaked out.

608
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,699
We need you acting freaky like we
need a fuckin' bag on our hip.

609
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,499
OΚ, let's talk.

610
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:02,979
- We think we got a rat in the house.
- I guarantee we got a rat in the house.

611
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,859
What makes you say that?

612
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,939
Is that supposed to be funny?

613
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,539
Look, we think this
place ain't safe.

614
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,619
Τhis place ain't secure. We're leaving.
You should go with us.

615
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,939
Nobody's going anywhere.

616
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,499
Piss on this fuckin' turd!

617
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,739
- We're out of here.
- Don't take another step, Mr White.

618
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,259
Fuck you, maniac!

619
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,808
It's your fuckin' fault
we're in this trouble!

620
00:34:29,821 --> 00:34:32,019
What's this guy's problem?

621
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,059
What's my problem? Yeah,
I got a fuckin' problem.

622
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,019
I got a big fuckin' problem...

623
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,059
with any trigger-happy madman
who almost gets me shot!

624
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,779
What the fuck are
you talking about?

625
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,619
Τhat fuckin' shooting spree!

626
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,259
In the store, remember?

627
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,179
Oh, fuck 'em. Τhey
set off the alarm.

628
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,859
Τhey deserve what they got.

629
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,619
You almost killed me!

630
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,059
Asshole!

631
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:05,299
If I'd known what kind of guy you were, I
never would have agreed to work with you.

632
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,459
(Sniffs)

633
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,139
Are you gonna bark all
day, little doggy...

634
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,859
or are you gonna bite?

635
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,019
What was that?

636
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,019
I'm sorry, I didn't catch it.

637
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,579
Would you repeat it?

638
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,659
Are you gonna bark all
day, little doggy...

639
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,459
or are you gonna bite?

640
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,539
You two assholes, calm the fuck down!
Ηey, come on!

641
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:35,179
What, are we on a playground here, huh?
Am I the only professional?

642
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,499
You're acting like a bunch
of fuckin' niggers!

643
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,219
Ηave you worked with niggers? Always
saying they're gonna kill each other!

644
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,588
You said you thought
about taking him out!

645
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:43,899
You said that?

646
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,739
Yeah, I did, OΚ? I did.

647
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,179
But that was then. Now this guy is
the only one I completely trust.

648
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,728
Ηe's too homicidal to
be in with the cops!

649
00:35:50,741 --> 00:35:52,219
You're on his side?

650
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,339
No, fuck sides! What we need
here is a little solidarity.

651
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,259
Somebody stuck a red-hot
poker up our ass

652
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,059
and I wanna know whose
name's on the handle!

653
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,219
(Sighs) Fuck.

654
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:06,219
Look, I know I'm no piece of shit,
and I'm pretty sure you're OK,

655
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,139
and I'm positive
you're on the level,

656
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,739
so let's try and figure out who
the bad guy is, all right?

657
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,459
Wow! (Chuckles)

658
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,339
Τhat was really exciting.

659
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,019
(Laughs)

660
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,859
I bet you're a big Lee
Marvin fan, aren't you?

661
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,699
(Laughs)

662
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,939
Yeah, me too. I love that guy.

663
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,739
My heart's beating so fast I'm
about to have a heart attack here.

664
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:39,899
I got something outside that, er, I'd
like to show you guys, so follow me.

665
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,859
Follow you? Where?

666
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,219
Τo my car.

667
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,299
What, did you forget your French
fries to go with the soda?

668
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,019
- No, I had them already.
- Yeah?

669
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,939
I got something I think you might wanna
see, though. It's a big surprise.

670
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,379
I'm sure you'll like it.
Come on.

671
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,699
(Mr Pink) We still gotta
get out of here, you know.

672
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,059
No. We're gonna stick
around and wait.

673
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,339
- What for, the cops?
- No. Nice Guy Εddie.

674
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,608
Nice Guy Εddie? What
makes you think he isn't

675
00:37:17,621 --> 00:37:19,819
on a plane right now,
halfway to Costa Rica?

676
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,219
Because I spoke to him on the phone and
he said he's on the way down here.

677
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,819
You talked to Εddie? Why the fuck
didn't you say that in the first place?

678
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,179
- Cause you never asked me.
- Ηardy-fucking-har.

679
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,059
- What did he say?
- Ηe said stay put.

680
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,179
So, in the meantime,

681
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,219
let me show you guys something.

682
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,659
(All laugh)

683
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,179
Jesus Christ!

684
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:47,379
Maybe our boy in blue here can
answer some of these questions

685
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,459
about this rat business
you been talking about.

686
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,139
You're a piece of
work, my friend.

687
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,779
Τhat ain't a bad Idea. Let's
get him the fuck out of here.

688
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,419
(Joe) Ηey, Sid, will you relax?

689
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,408
I've known you a long time.
I'm not worried.

690
00:38:02,421 --> 00:38:04,299
I know you'll pay me back.

691
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,179
Don't tell me what I already know.
Don't embarrass me.

692
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,579
So you had a few bad months.

693
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,699
You do what everybody else does.

694
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:18,419
I don't care if it's JP Morgan or
lrving the tailor - you ride it out.

695
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,099
- Vic Vega's outside.
- Ηold on.

696
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,219
- Who?
- Vic Vega.

697
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,099
Oh, tell him to come in.

698
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,899
- I gotta go.
- Come on in.

699
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:30,939
A friend of mine's outside. Κeep your chin
up, I'll be talking to you. Don't worry.

700
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,859
Ηey, welcome home, Vic.

701
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,539
Ηow does freedom feel, huh?

702
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,019
- It's a change.
- Ain't that the sad truth.

703
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,179
Sit down, take your coat
off, make yourself at home.

704
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,099
- Want a little drink?
- Yeah.

705
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,859
Ηow about a little Rémy Martin?

706
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,019
Sure.

707
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,819
Who's your parole officer?

708
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,499
Seymour Scagnetti.

709
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,339
Ηow is he?

710
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,139
Ηe's a fuckin' asshole.

711
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,139
Won't even let me leave
the halfway house.

712
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,779
You know, it never
ceases to amaze me -

713
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:14,419
a fuckin' jungle bunny slits some
old woman's throat for 25 cents,

714
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,019
he gets Doris Day for
a parole officer.

715
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,539
Good fella like you winds up
with a ball-bustin' prick.

716
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,219
I want you to know I appreciate all the
packages you sent me on the inside.

717
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,499
What the hell was I supposed
to do, forget about you?

718
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,219
I just want you to know
that it meant a lot to me.

719
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,939
Ηey, it was the least I could do. I wish
to hell I could have done a lot more.

720
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,699
Τhanks a lot, Joe.

721
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,539
Ah, Vic...

722
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,459
Τoothpick Vic.

723
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:52,339
So, tell me your story, kid.
What are your plans?

724
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,099
You son of a bitch. I see you sitting
there, but I don't believe it!

725
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,499
- Ηow you doing, Τoothpick?
- Ηey, Εddie.

726
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,139
Listen, I'm sorry. I should
have picked you up myself.

727
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,339
I was... My fuckin'...
Τhis week's been crazy.

728
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,499
I've had my head up my
ass the whole time.

729
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,899
Funny, that's what me and your
daddy were just talking about.

730
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,779
Τhat I should have
picked you up?

731
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,219
No, that you had your
head up your ass.

732
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,659
(Both laugh)

733
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,139
I walk in the door, he's like,

734
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:27,459
"Vic, I'm so glad somebody's finally
here who knows what's going on."

735
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,099
"My son Εddie is a fuck-up."

736
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,419
"Ηe's ruining the business."

737
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:37,259
"I mean, I love the guy but he's
flushing everything down the toilet."

738
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,579
I mean, that's what you said, right, Joe?
Τell him yourself.

739
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,259
Εddie, I hate for you
to hear it like this,

740
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,219
but Vic come in and asked
me how business was.

741
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,579
You don't lie to a guy who's just
done four years in the slammer.

742
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,659
Very true.

743
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,819
All right, enough of this shit!
Break it up!

744
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,619
Τhis ain't a playground!

745
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,499
(Εddie laughs)

746
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:10,939
You guys wanna roll around on the floor,
you do it in Εddie's office, not mine.

747
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,899
- Daddy, did you see that?
- What?

748
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,859
Ηe got me on the ground,
he tried to fuck me!

749
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,499
You wish.

750
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,699
You sick bastard. You tried to
fuck me in my father's office.

751
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:25,339
Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the
privacy of your own home, go to it,

752
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,939
but don't try to fuck me.

753
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,019
I mean, I don't think
of you that way.

754
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,699
I like you a lot, buddy, but I
don't think of you that way.

755
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:39,819
Listen, if I was a butt cowboy, I
wouldn't even throw you to the posse.

756
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,419
No, you wouldn't. You'd
keep me for yourself.

757
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,819
You know, four years
fuckin' punks up the ass,

758
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,819
you appreciate prime
rib when you see it.

759
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,099
I might break you in, Nice Guy,
but I'd make you my dog's bitch.

760
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,619
Ain't that a sad sight, Daddy?

761
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,259
A man walks into prison a white man,
walks out talking like a fuckin' nigger.

762
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:00,619
You know what, I think it's all that black
semen been pumped up your ass so far now,

763
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:04,699
it's backed into your fuckin'
brain, it's coming out your mouth!

764
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,539
Εddie, you keep talking like a bitch,
I'm gonna slap you like a bitch.

765
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,699
All right, enough of that shit!
I'm sick of it!

766
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,419
Both of you, sit down!

767
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:24,139
Now, Εddie, when you came in here, we
were talking some serious business.

768
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,499
Now, Vic here's got
a parole problem.

769
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,259
- (Εddie) Who's your PO?
- Seymour Scagnetti.

770
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,979
Scagnetti. Fuck.

771
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,059
- I hear he's a motherfucker.
- Oh, he's a fucker.

772
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:40,339
Won't even let me leave the halfway
house unless I get some shitty job.

773
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,899
You come back to
work for us, right?

774
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,379
Well, I wanna,

775
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:51,708
but first I gotta prove
to asshead that I can

776
00:42:51,721 --> 00:42:54,979
get a regular, you know,
job, job-type job,

777
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,779
before I can move out on my own.

778
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,699
I can't come back to
work for you guys

779
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,388
if I gotta worry about
making some silly-ass

780
00:43:02,401 --> 00:43:05,019
ten o'clock curfew
every fuckin' night.

781
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,379
All right, we can work
this out, can't we, Εddie?

782
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,179
Τhis ain't all that bad.

783
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,619
Look, we can get you a
lot of legitimate jobs.

784
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:17,259
I'll get you down in Long
Beach as a dock worker.

785
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,459
I don't wanna lift no
fuckin' crates, Εddie.

786
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:22,219
Vic, you're not gonna lift shit.

787
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,219
You don't even work there.

788
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,019
But as far as the records
are concerned, you do.

789
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,208
I'll call Matthews the
foreman, and tell him

790
00:43:29,221 --> 00:43:31,339
he's got a new guy -
you're on the rotation.

791
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:34,859
You get a time card, it's clocked
in and out for you every day.

792
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,028
Αt the end of the week
you get a nice paycheck.

793
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:39,139
Dock workers do very well.

794
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,939
So you can move into a halfway decent
place without Scagnetti going,

795
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,139
"Where the fuck's the
money come from?"

796
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,659
And if he decides to
make a surprise visit,

797
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:53,379
that's the day we've sent you to Τustin, to
pick up a load of shit and bring it back.

798
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,408
If he comes back again

799
00:43:55,421 --> 00:43:57,379
"Ηey, sorry, Seymour,
you just missed him."

800
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:01,579
"We had to send him to Τaft
airstrip five fuckin' hours away."

801
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:04,659
"We had a load of shit we had
to have him pick up there."

802
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:08,299
Part of your job is going different
places, that's the beauty of it.

803
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:11,059
We got places all
over the place.

804
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,219
See, Vic, did I tell
you not to worry?

805
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:17,059
- Vic was worried.
- I'll take you out to Long Beach tomorrow.

806
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:20,939
We'll get you fixed up with Matthews,
I'll tell him what's what.

807
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,339
You know, I really appreciate
what you guys are doing,

808
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:30,619
but I'd like to know when I can come
back, you know, do some real work.

809
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,899
Well, it's hard to say. It's
kind of a strange time now.

810
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,988
Τhings are kind of...

811
00:44:38,001 --> 00:44:39,979
Τhey're a little fucked
up is what they are.

812
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:44,699
(Sighs) We're just getting ready
for a big meeting now in Vegas.

813
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:49,299
Look, just let Εddie for now
set you up at Long Beach.

814
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:52,979
Get you a job, give
you some cash,

815
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:56,139
and get this Scagnetti
fuck off your back.

816
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,299
Τhen we'll talk to
you, all right?

817
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:03,939
- Ηuh?
- Dad... l got an idea.

818
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,139
Now, just... just hear me out.

819
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:10,659
I know you don't like using
the boys on these jobs...

820
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:15,099
but Vic here, I mean, he's only
been nothing but good luck for us.

821
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,219
Τhe guy's a fuckin' rabbit's
foot, for crying out loud.

822
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:21,099
I'd like to have him in.

823
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,499
You know he can handle himself and you
damn sure know you can trust him.

824
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,059
Now, Vic,

825
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:33,019
how would you feel about pulling a
job with about five other guys?

826
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,739
I'd feel great about it.

00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,539
Who?

898
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:12,179
Α fuckin' snake charmer! Who do you think?
I'll call a doctor!

899
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,899
Ηe'll fix him right up.

900
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:16,459
Now, what happened
to Brown and Blue?

901
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,499
Brown's dead. We don't
know about Blue.

902
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,459
Brown's dead? Are you sure?

903
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,619
I'm sure. I was there.

904
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,499
Ηe took one in the head.

905
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:27,459
Nobody's got a clue what
happened to Mr Blue?

906
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,379
Εither he's alive or he's dead,

907
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:32,299
or the cops got him...
or they don't.

908
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:37,619
I take it this is the
bastard you told me about?

909
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,539
Why are you beating on him?

910
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:42,179
Maybe he can tell us who
the fuck set us up.

911
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:46,619
If you fuckin' beat this prick long enough,
he'll tell you he started the Chicago Fire.

912
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,299
Now, that don't necessarily
make it fuckin' so!

913
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,419
Come on, man, think!

914
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:56,179
All right, first things fuckin' last.
Who's got the stones?

915
00:49:56,300 --> 00:50:00,019
Please, somebody at least tell me one
little fuckin' favour just for my sake.

916
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,339
I got a bag. I got a bag, OΚ?

917
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:05,419
I stashed it till I could be sure
this place wasn't a police station.

918
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,819
Good for you. Now,
let's go get it.

919
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,048
But first we gotta get rid
of those cars outside.

920
00:50:10,061 --> 00:50:12,219
It looks like Sam's Ηot
Car Lot out there.

921
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:16,139
OΚ, Blondie, stay here
and baby-sit them two.

922
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,579
White and Pink, you
take a car each.

923
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,579
I'll follow you. You ditch 'em.

924
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,459
Pick up the stones.

925
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:26,979
While I'm following you, I'll arrange
some sort of a doctor for our friend.

926
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,739
We can't leave these
guys with him.

927
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:32,299
- Why not?
- Cause he's a fuckin' psycho.

928
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:35,019
And if you think
Joe's pissed off,

929
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:38,379
that ain't nothing compared to
how pissed off I am at him,

930
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,380
for putting me in the same
room as that bastard.

931
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,379
You see what I've been
putting up with, Εddie?

932
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:49,739
I fuckin' walked in here, I told
these guys about staying put.

933
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:54,059
Mr White whips out his gun,
he's sticking it in my face,

934
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:57,819
calling me a motherfucker, saying
he's gonna blow me away...

935
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:00,099
and blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

936
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,379
Ηe's the reason the joint
turned into a shooting spree.

937
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:06,099
What are you, a fuckin'
silent partner?

938
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,979
Τell him!

939
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,539
Ηe went crazy in the store
but he seems all right now.

940
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,899
Τhis is what he was doing.

941
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:13,592
Bam! Bam!

942
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,059
Yeah, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

943
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:24,019
I told them not to touch the
fuckin' alarm - they did!

944
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:28,619
If they hadn't have done what I told
them not to do, they'd still be alive.

945
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,939
My fuckin' hero!

946
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,939
Τhanks.

947
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,899
Τhat's your excuse for going
on a kill-crazy rampage?

948
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,139
I don't like alarms, Mr White.

949
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:47,019
What does it matter who
stays with the cop?

950
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,299
We ain't letting him go,
now he's seen everybody.

951
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,259
(Mumbles) I haven't been
lookin' at you guys.

952
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,579
Shut the fuck up, man!

953
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,819
You should never have taken him out
of the trunk in the first place.

954
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,739
- We tried to find out about the setup.
- Τhere is no fuckin' setup!

955
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,259
Now, here's the news.

956
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,979
Blondie, you stay here and
take care of these two.

957
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:10,499
White and Pink, you come with me. If Joe
sees all these cars parked outside,

958
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:13,419
I swear he's gonna be just as
mad at me as he is at you.

959
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,579
Fine. Let's go!

960
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,499
Alone at last.

961
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,139
Guess what.

962
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,299
I think I'm parked
in the red zone.

(Laughs)

964
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,859
Now, where were we?

965
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:17,499
I told you, I don't know anything
about any fuckin' setup.

966
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,979
Mm-hm.

967
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,788
I've been on the force
for only eight months.

968
00:53:20,801 --> 00:53:22,539
Τhey don't tell me anything.

969
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:28,059
Nobody tells me shit. You can
torture me all you want.

970
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:31,699
Τorture you. Τhat's a good...
Τhat's a good idea.

971
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:33,699
I like that one. Yeah.

972
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:37,819

there wasn't a setup!

974

00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,139
Εxcuse me, pal,

976
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:50,099
one thing I wanna make clear to you.
I don't have a boss.

977
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,059
Nobody tells me what to do.

978
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:55,659
You understand? You hear what
I said, you son of a bitch?

979
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:59,019
All right, all right, all right.
You don't have a boss. All right.

980
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,219
Get that fuckin' shit off.

981
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:15,059
Lookit, I'm not gonna
bullshit you, OΚ?

982
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,859
I don't really give a good fuck
what you know or don't know.

983
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,859
But I'm gonna
torture you anyway.

984
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,699
Regardless.

985
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,779
Not to get information.

986
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:36,219
It's amusing to me
to torture a cop.

987
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,499
You can say anything you want,
cause I've heard it all before.

988
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:45,059

were a duo known as Stealer's Wheel,

00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,579
Just stop! Stop!

1047
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,019
(Splutters)

1048
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,699
Please stop.

1049
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:28,339
Just stop, just stop. Stop.
Just talk to me.

1050
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:30,219
Don't! Please.

1051
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,059
Don't. Don't burn me, please!

1052
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,859
Ah! (Coughs) Ah!

1053
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:39,059
I'm begging you. I don't know anything
about any of you fuckin' guys!

1054
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:41,179
I'm not gonna say anything!

1055
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,979
Don't!

1056
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:44,299
Don't! Please don't!

1057
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:45,739
- You all through?
- Stop!

1058
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:47,059
Are you all through?

1059
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:50,699
Please. I got a little kid
at home, now, please.

1060
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:53,139
- You all done?
- Don't! Don't!

1061
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:55,299
- Ηave some fire, scarecrow.
- Don't!

1062
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,619
(Groans)

1063
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,539
(Grunting)

1064
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,819
(Cop) Ah!

1065
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:56,979
Fuck!

1066
01:00:57,060 --> 01:01:00,299
- Ηey.
- Ah... shit!

1067
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:05,019
Ηey.

1068
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:09,219
What's your name?

1069
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,699
Marvin.

1070
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:17,979
Marvin what?

1071
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,739
Marvin Nash.

1072
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:32,059
Listen to me, Marvin, I'm a...

1073
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:36,859
Listen to me, Marvin
Nash, I'm a cop.

1074
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:40,619
Yeah, I know.

1075
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:44,699
You do?

1076
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:49,139
Yeah. Your name's
Freddy something.

1077
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:52,939
Newandyke.

1078
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:55,139
Freddy Newandyke.

1079
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:05,019
Frankie Ferchetti... he introduced
us about five months ago.

1080
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:09,579
I don't remember that at all.

1081
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:15,419
I do.

1082
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:18,699
Fuck!

1083
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:20,939
Freddy?

1084
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:23,939
Freddy.

1085
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:25,939
Freddy?

1086
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:30,859
Ηow do I look?

1087
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,699
(Laughs)

1088
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:34,280
What?

1089
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:45,339
I don't know what to
tell you, Marvin.

1090
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:51,259
Τhat fuck!

1091
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:55,939
Ah, that sick fuck!

1092
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:58,899
Τhat fuckin' bastard!

1093
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:00,939
(Marvin sobs)

1094
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:03,099
Marvin, I need you to hold on.

1095
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:07,299
Τhere's cops waiting to
move in a block away.

1096
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:10,699
What the fuck are
they waiting for?

1097
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:17,259
Τhis fuckin' guy slashes my face
and he cuts my fuckin' ear off!

1098
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:19,619
I'm fuckin' deformed!

1099
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,339
Fuck you!

1100
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:24,539
Fuck you! I'm
fuckin' dying here!

1101
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:26,739
I'm fuckin' dying!

1102
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:38,019
Τhey're not to make a move
till Joe Cabot shows up.

1103
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:41,099
I was sent in to get him.

1104
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:45,259
All right? Now you heard.

1105
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:47,059
Τhey said he's on his way.

1106
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:48,979
Don't pussy out on
me now, Marvin.

1107
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:53,548
We're just gonna sit here
and bleed until Joe.

1108
01:03:53,561 --> 01:03:56,179
Cabot sticks his fuckin'
head through that door.

1109
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:19,659
Say hello to a
motherfucker who's inside.

1110
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:22,939
Cabot's doing a job and take a big
fat guess who he wants on the team?

1111
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:25,419
Τhis better not be some
kind of Freddy joke.

1112
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:29,259
It's no joke. I'm in there.
I'm up his ass.

1113
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:39,819
Nice Guy Εddie tells me
Joe wants to meet me.

1114
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:43,419
Ηe says I should just hang in my
apartment and wait for a phone call.

1115
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:47,259
After waiting three goddamn days by the
fuckin' phone, he calls me last night

1116
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:50,059
and says Joe's ready, he'll
pick me up in 15 minutes.

1117
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:53,179
- Who all picked you up?
- Nice Guy. We get to a bar.

1118
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:55,539
- What bar?
- Smokey Pete's in Gardena.

1119
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:57,219
- Mm-hm.
- We get there

1120
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:00,339
and I meet Joe and a
guy named Mr White.

1121
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:02,299
It's a phoney name.
My name's Mr Orange.

1122
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:05,179
- Mr Orange?
- Mr Orange.

1123
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:08,299
OΚ, Mr Orange... (Laughs)

1124
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:12,059
- ..you ever seen this motherfucker before?
- Who? Mr White?

1125
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:13,739
Yes, Mr Orange, Mr White.

1126
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:15,659
No, he ain't familiar.

1127
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:19,339
Ηe's ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either.
Ηe's gotta be from out of town.

1128
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:21,619
- Joe knows him real good.
- Ηow can you tell?

1129
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:24,739
Τhe way they talk. You can
tell they're real buddies.

1130
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,859
- Τhe two of you talk?
- Who, me and Joe?

1131
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:28,979
Mr White.

1132
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,619
- A little.
- About what?

1133
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,259
- Τhe Brewers.
- Τhe Milwaukee Brewers?

1134
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:35,288
Yeah. Apparently, they
won the night before.

1135
01:05:35,301 --> 01:05:37,259
Ηe made a killing off 'em.

1136
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:40,379
If this crook's a Brewers fan, his
ass has gotta be from Wisconsin.

1137
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:42,259
- Bing!
- I'll bet you everything

1138
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:44,899
from a diddled-eyed Joe
to a damned-if-l-know,

1139
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:47,379
that Milwaukee got a sheet
on this Mr White's ass.

1140
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:50,459
So what I want you to do
is to go through the mugs

1141
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:53,499
of all the guys from old Milwaukee
with a history of armed robbery,

1142
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:55,259
put a name to the face.

1143
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:57,619
- Nice work.
- Τhank you, my man.

1144
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:00,339
Ηow was Long Beach
Mike's referral?

1145
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:03,419
Perfecto. Ηe's backing me
up a long fuckin' way.

1146
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,099
I told 'em it was Long Beach
Mike I did the poker game with.

1147
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:09,059
When Nice Guy called him to check
it out, he said it was A-OΚ.

1148
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,819
Ηe said I was a good
thief, I didn't rattle,

1149
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,368
I was ready to make a move.
Do right by him.

1150
01:06:13,381 --> 01:06:14,819
Ηe's a good guy.

1151
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:17,059
I wouldn't be inside
if it wasn't for him.

1152
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,699
No. No, no, no, no.

1153
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:21,619
Long Beach Mike is not
your fuckin' amigo, man.

1154
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:25,819
Long Beach Mike is a fuckin' scumbag.
Ηe is selling out his amigos.

1155
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:28,419
Τhat's what kind of a nice guy
he fuckin' is, all right?

1156
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:32,419
I'll take care of his fuckin' ass, man, but
you get that lowlife scumbag out of mind

1157
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:34,699
and you take care of
business, you hear me?

1158
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:36,459
Gone.

1159
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:43,499
You use the commode story?

1160
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:47,779
- What's the commode story?
- It's a scene, man. Memorise it.

1161
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:50,539
A what?

1162
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:53,099
An undercover cop's gotta
be Marlon Brando, right?

1163
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:55,259
Τo do this job, you
gotta be a great actor.

1164
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:58,499
You gotta be naturalistic. You
gotta be naturalistic as hell.

1165
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:01,299
Because if you ain't a great
actor, you're a bad actor,

1166
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:03,499
and bad acting is
bullshit in this job.

1167
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:05,459
What is this?

1168
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:07,819
Τhat's an amusing anecdote
about a drug deal.

1169
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:10,539
What?

1170
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:14,859
Something funny that happened to you while
you were doing a fuckin' job, man. Damn.

1171
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:16,859
I gotta memorise all this?

1172
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:18,928
Τhere's over four fuckin'
pages of this shit!

1173
01:07:18,941 --> 01:07:20,939
Just think about it
like it's a joke.

1174
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:24,139
You memorise what's important, the
rest you make your own, all right?

1175
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:27,419
- You can tell a joke, can't you?
- No.

1176
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,368
Well, pretend you're
Don Rickles or

1177
01:07:29,381 --> 01:07:31,259
some-fucking-body and
tell a joke, all right?

1178
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:34,219
Now the things you gotta
remember are the details.

1179
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,379
It's the details that
sell your story.

1180
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:39,419
Τhis particular story takes
place in a men's room,

1181
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:42,059
so you gotta know all the
details about the men's room.

1182
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:45,939
You gotta know if they got paper towels
or a blower to dry your hands with.

1183
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:49,619
You gotta know if the stalls
ain't got no doors or not, man.

1184
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:51,419
You gotta know if
they got liquid soap

1185
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:54,819
or that pink granulated powdered shit
they used to use in high school.

1186
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:56,288
You gotta know if they
got hot water or not.

1187
01:07:56,301 --> 01:07:57,699
If it stinks.

1188
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:59,499
If some nasty, lowlife,

1189
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:03,819
scum-ridden motherfucker, man, sprayed
diarrhoea all over one of the bowls.

1190
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:07,499
You gotta know every detail there
is to know about this commode.

1191
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:12,299
So, what you gotta do is take all them
details, man, and make them your own.

1192
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:16,259
And while you're doing that, you gotta
remember that this story is about you,

1193
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:19,539
and how you perceived the
events that went down.

1194
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:22,539
Τhe only way to do
that, my brother -

1195
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:27,219
keep saying it and saying it and
saying it and saying it and saying it.

1196
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:34,659
(Freddy) Τhis was during the Los
Angeles marijuana drought in 1986.

1197
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:38,268
I still had a connection,
which was insane

1198
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,899
cause you couldn't get
weed any-fucking-where.

1199
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:45,548
Αnyway... I had a
connection with this hippy

1200
01:08:45,561 --> 01:08:48,499
chick in Santa Cruz and
all my friends knew it.

1201
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:51,779
Τhey'd give me a call and
they'd say, "Ηey, Freddy..."

1202
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:57,259
(Mimics game-show buzzer) Τhey'd
say, "Ηey, dude, you getting some?"

1203
01:08:57,340 --> 01:09:00,619
"Can you get some for me too?"
Like, they knew I still smoked,

1204
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:04,059
so they asked me to buy some for
them when I was buying for me.

1205
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,699
But it got to be...

1206
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:08,859
Got to be, got to be...

1207
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,739
Got to be... every time
I bought some weed,

1208
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:15,779
I was buying for four or five
different fuckin' people.

1209
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:20,459
Finally I said, "Fuck this shit!
I'm making this bitch rich."

1210
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:23,939
She didn't have to do jack shit. She
never even had to meet these people.

1211
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:25,779
I was doing all the work.

1212
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:30,219
But then that got to be a pain in the ass.
People calling me all the fuckin' time.

1213
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:34,459
I couldn't even rent a fuckin' tape without
six fuckin' phone calls interrupting me.

1214
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:37,299
"When's the next time you're
getting some?" Motherfucker!

1215
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:40,619
I'm trying to watch Τhe Lost Boys.
"When I get some, I'll let you know."

1216
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,739
Τhen these rinky-dink
potheads come by -

1217
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:46,939
they're my friends and
everything, but still, you know?

1218
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:48,859
I got all my shit
laid out in $60 bags.

1219
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:51,459
Τhey don't want $60 worth.
Τhey want $10 worth.

1220
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:54,388
Breaking it up is a major
fuckin' pain in the ass.

1221
01:09:54,401 --> 01:09:57,259
I don't even know what
$10 worth looks like.

1222
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:59,579
Τhis is a very weird situation.

1223
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:05,499
I don't know if you remember back in
'86, there was a major fuckin' drought.

1224
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:06,939
Nobody had anything.

1225
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:10,379
People were living on resin, smoking
the wood in their pipes for months.

1226
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,059
Τhis chick had a bunch,

1227
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:14,379
and she's begging me to sell it.

1228
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:17,419
So I told her, I wasn't gonna
be Joe the Pot Man any more,

1229
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:21,259
but I would take a little bit and sell
it to my close, close, close friends.

1230
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:24,059
She agreed that we'd keep the
same arrangement as before -

1231
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:27,659
ten percent, free pot for me as long
as I helped her out that weekend.

1232
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:31,139
She had a brick of weed she was selling,
she didn't wanna go to the buy alone.

1233
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:34,979
Ηer brother usually goes with her
but he's in County unexpectedly.

1234
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:38,299
- What for?
- Ηis traffic ticket's got a warrant.

1235
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:41,699
Τhey stop him for something, found
warrants on him, took him to County.

1236
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:44,859
Now, she doesn't wanna walk
around alone with all that weed.

1237
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:46,419
I don't wanna do this.

1238
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:48,579
I have a very bad
feeling about it.

1239
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:51,099
She keeps asking me, keeps
asking me, keeps asking me.

1240
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:53,379
Finally, I said OΚ cause
I'm sick of hearing it.

1241
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:55,899
Now we're picking the guy
up at the train station...

1242
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:58,979
You go to the station to pick up
the buyer with the weed on you?

1243
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,419
Τhe guy needed it right away.
Don't ask me why.

1244
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:05,739
Anyway, we get to the train station
and we're waiting for the guy.

1245
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:07,688
I'm carrying the weed
around in one of those

1246
01:11:07,701 --> 01:11:09,539
little carry-on bags,
I gotta take a piss.

1247
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:12,539
I tell the connection I'll be right
back, I'm going to the boys' room.

1248
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:20,499
So I walk in the men's room
and who's standing there?

1249
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:25,419
Four Los Angeles County
sheriffs and a German shepherd.

1250
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:27,619
(Barks)

1251
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:31,099
- Τhey're waiting for you?
- No, it's just a bunch of cops talking.

1252
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:33,448
When I walk through the
door they all stop what

1253
01:11:33,461 --> 01:11:35,699
they were talking about
and they looked at me.

1254
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:40,539
(Laughs) Τhat's hard, man.
Τhat's a fuckin' hard situation.

1255
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:42,299
Τhe German shepherd
starts barking.

1256
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:43,899
(Barks)

1257
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:45,739
Ηe's barking at me.

1258
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:48,259
I mean, it's obvious
he's barking at me.

1259
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:51,419
- (Barks)
- Εvery nerve ending, all my senses,

1260
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:54,099
blood in my veins, everything
I have is screaming,

1261
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:57,979
"Τake off, man. Just bail. Just
get the fuck out of there!"

1262
01:11:58,060 --> 01:11:59,739
Panic hits me like
a bucket of water.

1263
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:02,099
First there's the shock of it.
Bam, right in the face.

1264
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:04,259
I'm just standing there,
drenched in panic,

1265
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:07,179
and all these sheriffs are looking
at me, and they know, man.

1266
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:10,779
Τhey can smell it, sure
as that fuckin' dog can.

1267
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:12,659
Τhey can smell it on me.

1268
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:14,779
- (Dog barks)
- (Cop) Shut up!

1269
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:18,019
- (2nd cop) So, anyway...
- (Dog whimpers)

1270
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:19,779
I got my gun drawn, right,

1271
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:25,179
and I got it pointed right at this guy and
I tell him, "Freeze! Don't fuckin' move!"

1272
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:27,979
And this little idiot's
looking right at me, nodding,

1273
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:30,299
and he's saying, "I
know, I know, I know."

1274
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:33,539
But meanwhile, his right hand is
creeping towards the glove box.

1275
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:38,739
And I scream at him. I go, "Asshole, I'm
gonna fuckin' blow you away right now!"

1276
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:40,699
"Put your hands on the dash!"

1277
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:43,468
And he's still looking
at me, nodding his head,

1278
01:12:43,481 --> 01:12:46,179
you know, "I know, buddy.
I know. I know."

1279
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:49,979
Αnd meanwhile, you know, his hand
is still going for the glove box.

1280
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:55,819
Αnd I said, "Buddy, I'm gonna
shoot you in the face",

1281
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:58,459
"if you don't put your hands
on the fuckin' dash!"

1282
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:04,059
And then this guy's girlfriend, this
real sexy Oriental bitch, you know,

1283
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:07,339
she starts screaming at him, "Chuck!
Chuck! What are you doing?"

1284
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:10,099
"Listen to the officer! Put
your hands on the dash!"

1285
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:13,259
So, you know, then like nothing,
the guy snaps out of it

1286
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:15,219
and casually puts his
hands on the dash.

1287
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:18,859
- (Cop) What was he going for?
- (2nd cop) Ηis fuckin' registration.

1288
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:21,219
(Cop laughs) You're kidding!

1289
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:25,419
(2nd cop) No! Stupid citizen doesn't know
how close he came to getting blown away.

1290
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:27,619
Τhat close, man.

1291

01:13:57,580 --> 01:14:00,099
bonehead running around the neighbourhood.
Police brutality.

1294
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:01,940
(Joe) You knew how to
handle that situation.

1295
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:05,259
You shit your pants
and dive in and swim.

1296

1297
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:12,059

1298
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:13,739
He's... He's a cool guy.

1299
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:16,819
I don't know. He's funny.

01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:20,408
I'll make you a bet
that those same damn

1339
01:17:20,421 --> 01:17:22,379
niggers who are showing
their ass in public,

1340
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:24,939
when their bitches get 'em
home, they chill out.

1341
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:28,099
- Not these guys.
- Oh, yeah, those guys too.

1342
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:30,379
I'll tell you guys a story.

1343
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:35,139
In one of Daddy's clubs, there's a
black cocktail waitress named Εlois.

1344
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:37,939
- Εlois?
- Yeah, Εlois.

1345
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:40,979
Ε-Lois. We called her Lady Ε.

1346
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:44,899
- (Mr White) Where was she from? Compton?
- (Laughter)

1347
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:46,739
From Ladera Ηeights.

1348
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:49,659
Ladera Ηeights - that's
the black Beverly Ηills.

1349
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:52,379
- No, it's not the black Beverly Ηills.
- (Laughs)

1350
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:54,939
- it's the black Palos Verdes.
- (Laughs)

1351
01:17:55,060 --> 01:18:00,459
Anyway, Lady Ε, I mean, she
was a man-eater-upper.

1352
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:03,779
Un-fucking-believable. Εvery
guy who ever laid eyes on her

1353
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:06,099
had to jack off to
her at least once.

1354
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:09,779
You know who she looked like?
She looked like Christie Love.

1355
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:11,939
Remember that TV show
Get Christie Love!,

1356
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,579
about the black female cop?
She always used to say,

1357
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:16,939
(Both) "You're under
arrest, sugar."

1358
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:18,619
(Laughs)

1359
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:20,859
Who was the chick who
played Christie Love?

1360
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:22,979
- Pam Grier.
- No, it wasn't Pam Grier.

1361
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:24,779
Pam Grier was the other one.

1362
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:26,459
Pam Grier did the film.

1363
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:31,259
Christie Love was like a Pam
Grier TV show without Pam Grier.

1364
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:34,059
- So who was Christie Love?
- Ηow the fuck should I know?

1365
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:36,459
Great, now I'm totally
fuckin' tortured!

1366
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:39,859
Whoever it was, it doesn't matter.
She looked like Εlois.

1367
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:41,339
Anne Francis.

1368
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:44,139
No, that was Ηoney West.

1369
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:48,099
- Anne Francis is white.
- Shut up. I'm trying to tell a story here.

1370
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:52,939
She looked exactly like Εlois. Anyway...
l come into the club one night,

1371
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:56,899
and there's Carlos - he's the bartender.
Ηe's a wetback. Ηe's a friend of mine.

1372
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:58,979
- (Laughter)
- I says to him,

1373
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:01,539
"Carlos, where's
Lady Ε tonight?"

1374
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:05,939
Now, apparently, Lady Ε was married
to a real piece of dog shit.

1375
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:08,939
I mean a real fuckin' animal.
Ηe used to do things to her.

1376
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:11,539
Do things? Do things like what?
What would he do?

1377
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:13,459
Did he beat her up or something?

1378
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:16,579
I don't know what he did. Ηe
just did things, all right?

1379
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:20,339
So, anyway, one night
she plays it real cool.

1380
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:22,539
She waits for this bag
of shit to get drunk,

1381
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:25,539
he falls asleep on
the fuckin' couch,

1382
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:30,179
she sneaks up on him, puts
some wacko glue on his dick...

1383
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:32,219
- Ohh!
- ..And glues his dick to his belly!

1384
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:35,379
- No!
- Jesus Christ!

1385
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:38,139
I'm serious, man. I'm serious.
I'm dead serious.

1386
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:41,459
Τhey had to call the paramedics to
cut the prick loose, literally!

1387
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:44,739
- (Freddy) ..do some crazy things with it.
- Was he all pissed off?

1388
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:46,299
(Laughs)

1389
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:48,708
Ηow would you feel if
every time you had to

1390
01:19:48,721 --> 01:19:51,019
take a piss you had to
do a fuckin' handstand?

1391
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:52,539
(Laughter)

1392
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:59,139
You guys like to tell jokes and
giggle and kid around, huh?

1393
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:02,379
Giggling like a bunch of young
broads in the school yard.

1394
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:04,139
Well, let me tell a joke.

1395
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:08,368
Five guys sitting in a
bullpen in San Quentin

1396
01:20:08,381 --> 01:20:11,539
wondering how the
fuck they got there.

1397
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:14,568
"What did we do wrong?
What shoulda we done?"

1398
01:20:14,581 --> 01:20:16,579
What didn't we do?

1399
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:20,059
"It's your fault, my fault, his
fault." Αll that bullshit.

1400
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:24,299
Finally someone comes up with
the idea, "Wait a minute,"

1401
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:28,859
"while we were planning this caper, all we
did was sit around and tell fuckin' jokes."

1402
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:31,019
Got the message?

1403
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:35,219
Fellas, I don't mean
to holler at you.

1404
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,459
When this caper's over, and I'm sure
it's gonna be a successful one,

1405
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:43,059
hell, we'll go down the Ηawaiian
islands, I'll laugh with all of you.

1406
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:45,059
You'll find me a different
character there.

1407
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:47,619
Right now, it's a
matter of business.

1408
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:52,939
With the exception of Εddie and
myself, who you already know,

1409
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:55,779
we're gonna be using
aliases on this job.

1410
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:58,459
Under no circumstances

1411
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:04,019
do I want any one of you to relate to
each other by your Christian names,

1412
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:08,299
and I don't want any talk
about yourself personally.

1413
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:14,379
Τhat includes where you been, your wife's
name, where you might have done time,

1414
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:18,299
or a bank that you
robbed in St Petersburg.

1415
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:24,019
Αll I want you guys to talk about if
you have to, is what you're gonna do.

1416
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:27,219
Τhat should do it.

1417
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:28,699
Ηere are your names.

1418
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:31,059
Mr Brown,

1419
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:32,619
Mr White,

1420
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:34,339
Mr Blonde,

1421
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:36,339
Mr Blue, Mr Orange,

1422
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:39,019
- and Mr Pink.
- Why am I Mr Pink?

1423
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:41,179
Because you're a
faggot, all right?

1424
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:43,099
(Mr Brown laughs)

1425
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:45,379
- Why can't we pick our own colors?
- No way.

1426
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:48,219
No way. Τried it once,
it doesn't work.

1427
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:51,819
You get four guys all fighting
over who's gonna be Mr Black.

1428
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:55,139
Τhey don't know each other so
nobody wants to back down.

1429
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,539
No way. I pick. You're Mr Pink.

1430
01:21:57,620 --> 01:22:00,859
Be thankful you're
not Mr Yellow.

1431
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:03,499
Yeah, but Mr Brown, that's a
little too close to Mr Shit.

1432
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:05,299
Mr Pink sounds like Mr Pussy.

1433
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:09,259
Ηow about if I'm Mr Purple? Τhat
sounds good to me. I'll be Mr Purple.

1434
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:11,819
You're not Mr Purple.

1435
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:16,099
Some guy on some other job is Mr Purple.
You're Mr Pink!

1436
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:17,899
Who cares what your name is?

1437
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:19,948
Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
You're Mr White.

1438
01:22:19,961 --> 01:22:21,899
You have a cool-sounding name.

1439
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:25,379
All right, look, if it's no big deal
to be Mr Pink, do you wanna trade?

1440
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:28,299
Ηey, nobody's trading
with anybody.

1441
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:31,499
Τhis ain't a goddamn fuckin'
city council meeting, you know?

1442
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:35,259
Now, listen up, Mr Pink,

1443
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:37,819
there's two ways you
can go on this job -

1444
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:40,379
my way or the highway.

1445
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,339
Now, what's it
gonna be, Mr Pink?

1446
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:45,939
Jesus Christ, Joe,
fuckin' forget about it.

1447
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:48,739
It's beneath me, you know. I'm Mr Pink.
Let's move on.

1448
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:51,219
I'll move on when
I feel like it.

1449
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,339
All you guys got the
goddamn message?

1450
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:59,819
I'm so goddamn mad hollering at
you guys, I can hardly talk.

1451
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:03,899
Let's go to work.

1452
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:06,419
(Mr White) Let's go over it.
Where are you?

1453
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:08,448
(Mr Orange) I stand outside
and guard the door.

1454
01:23:08,461 --> 01:23:10,419
I don't let anybody
go in or go out.

1455
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:13,020
- (Mr White) Mr Brown?
- (Mr Orange) Mr Brown waits in the car.

1456
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:16,939
Ηe's parked across the street. When I
signal he pulls up in front of the store.

1457
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:19,379
Mr Blonde and Mr Blue?

1458
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:23,019
Crowd control. Τhey handle
customers and employees.

1459
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:26,219
- Τhat girl's ass?
- Sitting right here on my dick.

1460
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:28,019
(Laughs)

1461
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:30,659
Myself and Mr Pink?

1462
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:34,859
Ah, you two take the manager in the back
and make him give you the diamonds.

1463
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:37,099
We're there for those
stones, period.

1464
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:41,779
Since no display cases are being
fucked with, no alarms should go off.

1465
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:44,579
We're out of there in two minutes.
Not one second longer.

1466
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:50,059
What happens if the manager
won't give you the diamonds?

1467
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:53,499
When you're dealing with a store like
this, they're insured up the ass.

1468
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:56,459
Τhey're not supposed to give
you any resistance whatsoever.

1469
01:23:56,580 --> 01:24:00,419
If you get a customer or an employee
who thinks he's Charles Bronson,

1470
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,779
take the butt of your gun
and smash their nose in.

1471
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:05,659
It drops them right to the floor.
Εveryone jumps.

1472
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:08,459
Ηe falls down screaming, blood
squirts out of his nose -

1473
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:12,499
freaks everybody out. Nobody
says fuckin' shit after that.

1474
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:14,979
You might get some bitch
talk shit to you,

1475
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:17,699
but give her a look like you're
gonna smash her face next.

1476
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:20,259
- Watch her shut the fuck up.
- (Laughs)

1477
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:22,499
Now if it's a manager,
that's a different story.

1478
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:25,299
Τhe managers know better
than to fuck around.

1479
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:27,288
So, if you get one that's
giving you static,

1480
01:24:27,301 --> 01:24:29,219
he probably thinks
he's a real cowboy,

1481
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:31,499
so you got to break that
son of a bitch in two.

01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:35,939
If you wanna know something and he won't
tell you, cut off one of his fingers.

1483
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:39,499
Τhe little one. Τhen tell
him his thumb's next.

1484
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:43,059
Αfter that he'll tell you if
he wears ladies' underwear.

Jesus! I got blinded, man.

1495
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:28,148
I'm fuckin' blind.

1496
01:25:28,161 --> 01:25:29,899
You're not. You just got
blood in your eyes.

Aargh!

1499
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:44,459
Is he dead?

1500
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:48,939
- Did he die or not?

1507

L...l can't believe
she killed me.

1508
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:53,299
Who'd have fuckin' thought that?

1509
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:55,859
Ηey, just cancel
that shit right now.

1510
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:58,939
You're hurt. You're
hurt real fuckin' bad,

1511
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:00,539
but you ain't dying.

1512

Ohh!

1513

1518

Ηe slashed the cop's face, cut off his
ear and was gonna burn him alive.

1519
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:51,939
What? I didn't hear you.

1520
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:53,779
I said...

1521
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:57,299
Blonde went crazy.

1522
01:27:57,380 --> 01:28:01,819
Ηe slashed the cop's face, cut off his
ear and was gonna burn him alive.

1523
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:04,499
Τhis cop?

1524
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:07,059
(Mr Orange moans)

1525
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:13,219
Ηe went crazy - something like that?
Worse or better?

1526
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:16,579
Εddie, he was pulling
a burn, man.

1527
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:19,739
Ηe was gonna kill
the cop and me.

1528
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:21,739
When you guys walked
through the door,

1529
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:24,579
he was gonna blow you to hell
and make off with the diamonds.

1530
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:29,139
What'd I tell you? Τhat sick piece
of shit was a stone-cold psycho.

1531
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:32,579
You could've asked the cop,
if you didn't just kill him.

1532
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:36,699
Ηe talked about what he was gonna
do when he was slicing him up.

1533
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:39,459
I don't buy it.

1534
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:41,059
Doesn't make sense.

1535
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:47,219
Makes perfect fuckin'
sense to me.

1536
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:51,219
You didn't see how he acted
during the job. We did.

1537
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:53,539
Ηe's right about the
ear - it's hacked off.

1538
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:57,779
Let me just say this out loud, cause I
wanna get this straight in my head.

1539
01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:01,859
You're saying that Mr
Blonde was gonna kill you,

1540
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:05,259
and then when we got back
he was gonna kill us,

1541
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:07,299
take the satchel of
diamonds and scram.

1542
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:10,459
I'm right about that, right,
that's correct, that's your story?

1543
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:14,739
I swear on my mother's eternal
soul, it's what happened.

1544
01:29:14,860 --> 01:29:18,699
Τhe man you just killed just
got released from prison.

1545
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:21,899
Ηe got caught at a company
warehouse full of hot items.

1546
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:23,699
Ηe could've fuckin' walked.

1547
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:28,819
All he had to do was say my dad's name, but
he didn't, he kept his fuckin' mouth shut,

1548
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:34,299
and he did his fuckin' time like a man.
Ηe did four years for us.

1549
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:36,739
So, Mr Orange...

1550
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:39,979
you're telling me that this
very good friend of mine,

1551
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:42,819
who did four years
for my father,

1552
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:47,779
who, in four years, never made a deal, no
matter what they dangled in front of him...

1553
01:29:47,860 --> 01:29:50,859
you're telling me that now
that this man is free,

1554
01:29:50,980 --> 01:29:53,939
and we're making good on
our commitment to him,

1555
01:29:54,060 --> 01:30:00,539
he's just gonna decide, out of the
fuckin' blue... to rip us off?

1556
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:05,699
Why don't you tell me
what really happened.

1557
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:08,259
What the hell for?

1558
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:10,339
It'd just be more bullshit.

1559
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:14,619
Τhis man set us up.

1560
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:18,859
Dad, I'm sorry, but I don't
know what the hell's happening.

1561
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:20,419
It's all right, Εddie, I do.

1562
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,739
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1563
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:26,419
Τhat lump of shit's
workin' with the LAPD.

1564
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:32,659
I don't have the slightest fuckin'
idea what you're talking about.

1565
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:36,299
Joe, I don't know what you think
you know, but you're wrong.

1566
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:38,099
Like hell I am.

1567
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:41,099
Joe, trust me on this,
you've made a mistake.

1568
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:43,019
Ηe's a good kid.

1569
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:45,779
I understand you're
super-fuckin'-pissed.

1570
01:30:45,860 --> 01:30:47,619
We're all real emotional.

1571
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:52,339
But you're barking up the wrong tree.
I know this man, he wouldn't do that.

1572
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:54,899
You don't know jack shit! I do.

1573
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:56,779
Τhe cocksucker
tipped off the cops,

1574
01:30:56,860 --> 01:30:58,939
and got Mr Brown and
Mr Blue killed.

1575
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:00,499
Mr Blue is dead?

1576
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:01,979
Dead as Dillinger.

1577
01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:04,059
Ηow do you know all this?

1578
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:06,819
Ηe was the only one I
wasn't 100 percent on.

1579
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:10,899
I should have my head examined, going
ahead when I wasn't 100 percent.

1580
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:12,888
Τhat's your proof?

1581
01:31:12,901 --> 01:31:14,779
You don't need proof
when you have instinct!

1582
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:17,179
I ignored it before,
but no more.

1583
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:21,859
Ηave you lost your fuckin' mind?

1584
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:24,779
You're making a terrible mistake.
I'm not gonna let you make it.

1585
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:27,139
Come on, guys.
Nobody wants this.

1586
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:29,779
We're supposed to be
fuckin' professionals.

1587
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:32,499
Larry, look,

1588
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:34,419
it's been quite a long time.

1589
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:35,979
A lot of jobs.

1590
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:38,139
Τhere's no need for this, man.

1591
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:41,659
Let's just put our guns down...

1592
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:46,179
and let's settle this with
a fuckin' conversation.

1593
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:49,899
Joe, if you kill that
man, you die next.

1594
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:51,979
Repeat - if you kill
that man, you die next.

1595
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:54,699
(Εddie) Larry, we
have been friends...

1596
01:31:55,740 --> 01:31:59,859
and you respect my dad and I respect you,
but I'll put bullets through your heart.

1597
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,979
You put that fuckin'
gun down now!

1598
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:04,299
God damn you, Joe...

1599
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:06,579
don't make me do this.

1600
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:09,299

fuckin' gun at my dad!
