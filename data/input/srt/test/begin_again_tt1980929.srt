1
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,090
Thank...Thank you.

2
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,480
Thanks very much.

3
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,211
And I know that
there's a lot of people

4
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,522
on the list to play tonight,
but I was wondering

5
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,489
if I could just add one more.

6
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,120
She's a friend of mine who,

7
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,408
like me, is a long way from home.

8
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,609
And if it's Ok with you,
I was wondering if you'd like her

9
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,411
to come up here and
play one of her songs.

10
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,840
Is that Ok? Yeah?

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,526
Gretta, would you come
up here, please?

12
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,568
Uh, just give me a moment.

13
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,360
I think it would be a good idea if you'd
come up and sing one of your songs.

14
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,050
It would be a
really fucking bad idea.

15
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,401
Oh, Gretta, come on,
this is New York.

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,688
No.
You want to hear it, right?

17
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,171
Yeah?

18
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,527
Yeah?
Yes!

19
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,842
Sing it!

20
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,565
You're gonna be amazing.

21
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,484
Um, hi.

22
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,042
Uh, so this is a new song,
so it might be kind of rough.

23
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,445
Um...It's for anyone who's ever
been alone in the city.

24
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:16,745
# so you find yourself at the subway #

25

# with your world in a bag by your side #

26
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:28,834
# and all at once, it seemed like a good way #

27
00:02:30,797 --> 00:02:34,828
# you realize, it’s the end of the life #

28
00:02:36,821 --> 00:02:39,884

29
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,635

00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:51,781
# there goes the pain. it cuts to black #

31
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:58,875
# are you ready for the last act #
# to take a step #

32
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:03,541
# you can’t take back #

33
00:03:09,838 --> 00:03:11,200
# did she love you #

34
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:14,886
# did she take you down #

35
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:17,823
# was she on her knees #

36
00:03:18,228 --> 00:03:21,886
# when she kissed your crown #

37
00:03:21,928 --> 00:03:27,313
# tell me what you found #

38
00:03:29,865 --> 00:03:32,875
# so you find yourself at the subway #

39
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:39,803
# with your world in a bag by your side #

40
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,605
Thanks.

41
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,641
See?

[DROWNING POOL BY THE WALLS]

43
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,200
# It’s a drowning pool, it’s a drowning pool
this game is cruel and phoney #

44
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:15,500
# don’t you ever trust, don’t think you must

# he can press the flesh... #

46
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,768
It's 7:00am.
Good morning, New York, and welcome to

47
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,447
the second hour of Potsy and Andy
in the Morning!

48
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,728
Hey, Potsy, did you, uh...
did you read about the dog?

49
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,406
The Korean restaurant thing?
Oh, I certainly did.

50
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,800
Did you hear about that, Katie?

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,200
# it’s a drowning pool, it’s a drowning pool
it can pull you deep down under #

52
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:52,200
# it’s a drowning pool, it’s a drowning pool

wonder how he feeds that belly #

55
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:25,000
# it’s a drowning pool, it’s a drowning pool

00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,800
# it’s a drowning pool, it’s a drowning pool

57
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,528
Fresh prospects, let's hear it.
What do you got for me?

58
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,922
No, no!
Who's next on this delightful journey?

59
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,882
No, no, no, no, man.
No!

60
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,447
No, you can't...
No, you can't!

61
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,809
It's shit. It's shit!

62
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,564
Get fucking out of my car.

63
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,724
Give me anything, a song,
a hoOk, anything I can work with.

64
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,920
I'm not asking for much.

65
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,247
That's something. That's good.

66
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,810
Until you started to sing.

67
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,880
Fuck.

68
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,525
Shit.

69
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,050
Where's Mom?

70
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,168
Where's my daughter?

71
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,566
What do you mean?

72
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,770
Your mom has a deadline.
She asked me to watch you today.

73
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,566
Let's go.

74
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,567
So where do you want to go,
the Museum of Natural History?

75
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,609
You want to go to the park
and get ice cream or what?

76
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,331
Why would I want to do that?
I'm not ten.

77
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,366
What's that smell?

78
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,450
Oh, that's gasoline. I was filling up
the car with gasoline,

79
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,126
and then I spilled
a little on my pant leg.

80
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,770
That isn't alcohol.

81
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,924
I think I got a meeting here.

82
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,720
You want to wait here
or you want to come?

83
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,844
You think you have a meeting?
Do you or not?

84
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,604
Let's see.

85
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,005
See? This is fun, right?

86
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,601
When we came into this neighborhood
in '92, there was nobody here.

87
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,286
It was like a war zone.
HoOkers, crack...

88
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,489
Now it's totally gentrified.
I know, Dad.

89
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,284
I've had the tour.

90
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,600
Ok, we're gonna
go up here. Just be quiet.

91
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,762
There's more of a dynamic of...

92
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,208
I think it's a great way
to generate revenue for the company.

93
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,328
Hi, um...
Hey.

94
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,926
Was there bad traffic?

95
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,562
Uh, no, traffic was actually
pretty good. I was just passing by.

96
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,803
Ok, well, we were just...
we were...

97
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,009
closing up about this
audio commentary piece.

98
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,243
Yeah, shit idea.
It was a shit idea then.

99
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,607
Still a shit idea.
It didn't age well.

100
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,888
Oh yeah, we...
we appreciate your candor.

101
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,606
We had...We had a different
view of it here, though.

102
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,207
I mean, musicians, for the most part,
are pretty much monosyllabic teenagers

103
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,081
who really don't have that much to say,
and that's the good ones, right?

104
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,164
So what are we doing here?
The music industry is fine.

105
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,688
It's always gonna be fine.
We always have been fine.

106
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,650
Maybe the kids are right.
Maybe music should be free anyway.

107
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,201
That's an alarming thing to hear
the head of a record company say.

108
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,204
What? The truth?
Well, um...

109
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,800
Hm. Thanks so much, Karen.
Yeah, let me know.

110
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,724
Uh, let's...let's talk more.
I really appreciate you...

111
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,200
Yeah, of course.
coming by.

112
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,044
Thanks, guys.
Great meeting.

113
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,560
Good to see you, Dan.
I'm glad we got that figured out.

114
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,045
Thank you.
Yeah.

115
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,450
Bands doing audio commentary
on their own music

116
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,729
is so fucking lame,
Saul, and you know it.

117
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,242
Ten years ago, man,
you would've shit on that idea.

118
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,209
It's something.
It's an idea.

119
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,442
It's something that helps
keep the lights on. It's something.

120
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,331
We need vision,
not gimmicks.

121
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,927
That's us.
I've been following you, Mr. Mulligan.

122
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,730
Down a track on every long shot

123
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,960
you've been bringing
in here for the last five years,

124
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,642
and which one of them has come in?
Which one?

125
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,566
Dan. Dan!

126
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,644
See you later, brother Saul.

127
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,329
Dan!

128
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,330
We need to talk, man.

129
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,370
Come back here.
Don't you walk away from me, man.

130
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,444
You can't do this shit, man.
You can't pull this shit, dude.

131
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,648
You can't pull this shit!

132
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,081
You want to do...
Don't do this here.

133
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,810
I'm gonna do it right fucking here.

134
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,803
Let's do it, then.
All right, let's do it!

135
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,042
Because they know, they know.
They know what?

136
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,965
These people know that they
are sitting behind those desks

137
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,169
because I started an
independent record label

138
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,527
above that bar, Saul.

139
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,604
And we changed the way that
things were gonna be done, man.

140
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,845
Nurture and foster.
Things change, times change.

141
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,241
People got to change with them, Dan.

142
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,125
It's not working.
You got to go.

143
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,681
I don't have time
for this shit, man.

144
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,604
I got my own shit
going on, all right?

145
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,286
I'm getting...I'm taking my
client list. I'm out of here, man.

146
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,965
I am fucking out of here.

147
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,726
What are you talking about?
They signed to us.

148
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,928
Don't bother her.
Don't bother her.

149
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,287
It's not Jerry Maguire.

150
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,761
Dad, let's go.

151
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,804
I'm taking my art, then.
That's it, I'm taking the art.

152
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,167
It's my art.
I paid for it.

153
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,964
I bought it.
I picked it out.

154
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,529
I got it.
Get away from me. Get away.

155
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,642
I got it, I got it.
No, you don't. Let go.

156
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,089
Stop it!
Leave it there.

157
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,767
I'm coming back for that.
That's mine.

158
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,964
All of that's mine.
Come on, baby.

159
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,120
You want another one?

160
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,330
Um, I do, but I won't.

161
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,960
I mustn't. I can't.

162
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,244
How could he fire me when I set
the whole fucking thing up?

163
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,243
Did you?

164
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,607
Don't you know anything
about your father?

165
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,730
Yeah.
I do.

166
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,565
I know what Mom says.
What does Mom say?

167
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,690
She says you're a pathetic loser.

168
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,291
She says that affectionately.

169
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,331
What about you?
What do you think?

170
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,165
I don't really know you.

171
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,004
So...

172
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,521
You know, two years is a long time
in the life of a teenager.

173
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,480
Where'd you learn to talk like that?
My psychiatrist.

174
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,764
Psychiatrist.
You have a psychiatrist now?

175
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,447
I do. Mom thought it would be
a good idea. I was acting strange.

176
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,880
There's nothing strange
about you, all right?

177
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,367
You're 15 years old. You don't need
a fucking psychiatrist.

178
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,569
Believe me, I know.
I know you better than anybody.

179
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,644
Yeah, you sure do, Dad.

180
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,211
How old did you say I was?

181
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,607
Did I say you were 15?
I meant you were 14.

182
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,410
Did I say 15?

183
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,330
You got money to pay
for these beers?

184
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,721
I don't...I...I'm a kid.
I don't have any money on me.

185
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,611
What happened to your pocket money?
I spent that on condoms.

186
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,087
I...What?

187
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,561
No, no, no, no, no.
Too much information.

188
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,805
You ready?
For what?

189
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,123
Ah!

190
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,567
That was fun, right?
Don't smile.

191
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,371
It was fun, Dad.
Yeah. You had a good time.

192
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,251
We haven't ran like that
since you were little. That was good.

193
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,321
This your daddy?
Hey.

194
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,130
I'm glad you're here.
LoOk away.

195
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,886
I was just going to the car...

196
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,809
You Ok?
I'm fine.

197
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,769
I'm sorry. My bad.

198
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,684
Have a great day.

199
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,570
I could've taken that guy,
just didn't want to make a scene.

200
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,205
Do me a favor, all right? Don't tell
your mom I lost my job today.

201
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,323
Listen to me...

202
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,926
Thanks for a really
normal day, Dad.

203
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,730
What?

204
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,891
Shit.

205
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,681
Hello, everyone.

206
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,763
Hi.
Hi.

207
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,727
How's work?
Uh, fine.

208
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,570
You loOk hungry.

209
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,771
Her teachers are
really worried about her.

210
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,606
No girls like her at school.
She is distant, and basically,

211
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,683
the only people who want
to hang outwith her

212
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,604
are older boys who want to fuck her.

213
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,683
Oh, really? And you find that
a big surprise

214
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,729
seeing how you let...you let
her walk out of the house

215
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,566
loOking like...l...like...
Jodie Foster from Taxi Driver?

216
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,290
She dresses the way she wants to,

217
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,408
and besides, any daughter
who dresses like that

218
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,324
only wants one thing.
A pimp?

219
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,802
No, Dan, think about it.
A daddy.

220
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,480
That is fucking bullshit.

221
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,642
She needs some guidance,
for fuck's sake.

222
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,569
Well, guide her! Guide her!

223
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,081
You waltz in here
like a fucking clown,

224
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,323
you tell me how to raise my kid,

225
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,847
the kid that you pick up
once a month and decide

226
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,606
you have a fucking conscience about.
You know what?

227
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,730
Thirty seconds after you're gone,

228
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,804
we'll have totally forgotten
you were ever here.

229
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,210
Thank you.

230
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,326
Shit.

231
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,126
Fuck.

232
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,685
I thought there was no hope.

233
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,683
I thought there were no answers,

234
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,922
and then I found God.

235
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,243
God may not always be
on our time,

236
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,687
but he's on time.

237
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,804
Whenever you're alone...
Sir?

238
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,930
Go.

239
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,048
Have a talk with God.

240
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,644
Right, man.
Ok.

241
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,847
I'm gonna have a little talk
with God, all right.

242
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,401
Thank you. Thank you.

243
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,006
What if he doesn't answer?

244
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,891
Attention,
due to a signal malfunction

245
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,401
at Jay Street,
the next uptown train...

246
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,767
Fuck.
will arrive in 20 minutes.

247
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,611
Hey.
Give me a bourbon. Hurry up.

248
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,730
What kind of bourbon you want?
Well, I don't care.

249
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,971
and I was wondering

250
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,851
if it might be Ok if she came
up here and sang a song.

251
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,650
Is that Ok? Yeah?

252
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,201
Gretta, would you
come up here, please?

253
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,051
Hi.

254
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,602
So, this is a new song,
so it might be kind of rough. Um...

255
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,930
It's for anyone who's ever
been alone in the city.

256
00:18:03,894 --> 00:18:07,894
# so you find yourself at the subway #

257
00:18:09,902 --> 00:18:13,902
# with your world in a bag by your side #

258
00:18:15,881 --> 00:18:19,854
# and all at once, it seemed like a good way #

259
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,860
# you realize, it’s the end of the line #

260
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,919
# for what it’s worth #

261
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:36,846
# here comes the train on the track #

262
00:18:36,937 --> 00:18:40,725
# there goes the pain #

263
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,860
# it cuts to black #

264
00:18:42,952 --> 00:18:49,704
# are you ready for the last act #
# to take a step #

265
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,819
# you can’t take back #

266
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:09,933
# taking all the punches you could take #

267
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:15,694
# toOk ‘em all, right on the chin #

268
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:21,933
# and now the camel’s back is breaking #

269
00:19:22,063 --> 00:19:23,839
# again #

270
00:19:26,337 --> 00:19:32,912
# again, for what it’s worth #

271
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:38,766
# here comes the train upon the track #

272
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:41,933
# there goes the pain #

273
00:19:42,046 --> 00:19:43,746
# it cuts to black #

274
00:19:43,837 --> 00:19:48,071
# are you ready for the last act #

275
00:19:48,112 --> 00:19:50,933
# to take a step #

276
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,839
# you can’t take back #

277
00:20:01,894 --> 00:20:03,902
# did she love you #

278
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,839
# did she take you down #

279
00:20:07,981 --> 00:20:10,777
# was she on her knees #

280
00:20:10,888 --> 00:20:13,871
# when she kissed your crown #

281
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:19,694
# tell me what you found #

282
00:20:22,586 --> 00:20:28,694
# here comes the rain, so hold your hat #

283
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:33,871
# and don’t pray to god #
# cause he won’t talk back #

284
00:20:33,912 --> 00:20:40,902
# are you ready for the last act #
# to take a step #

285
00:20:43,156 --> 00:20:45,923
# you can’t take back #

286
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:48,871
# back. back #

287
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,729
# you can’t take back #

288
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:54,850
# back. back #

289
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,881
# so you find yourself at the subway #

290
00:21:01,966 --> 00:21:06,933
# with your world in a bag by your side #

291
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,765
Thanks.

292
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,084
I'm in.
What?

293
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,208
I want to make records with you.

294
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,681
I want to...
I want to produce you.

295
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,207
I want to sign you.
We're meant to work together.

296
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,320
Sorry, didn't you see
what just happened up there?

297
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,727
Yeah, what? Are you
feeling sorry for yourself?

298
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,804
No, I like my music. Who cares
if they don't get it, right?

299
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,201
You just need to work on
your performance a bit.

300
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,607
I'm not a performer,
I write songs from time to time.

301
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,250
Are all the songs
as good as that one?

302
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,166
Are you really an A&R man?
You loOk more like a homeless man.

303
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,245
I've been celebrating all weekend,
I signed a band and we got carried away.

304
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,722
That's some song you got there.
I promise you it could be a big hit.

305
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,211
Plus, you're beautiful.

306
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,249
Sorry, what's beauty
got to do with anything?

307
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,370
Jesus, you're tricky, aren't you?
No, I actually just think

308
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,330
that music is about ears,
not eyes.

309
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,165
And I'm not Judy Garland
just off a Greyhound bus

310
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,403
loOking for stardom,
but really, thank you.

311
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,571
Ok, bye.
Bye.

312
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,846
Ok, here's the truth.

313
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,120
I couldn't have signed you
if I wanted to, all right?

314
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,611
Ok.

315
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,207
I didn't come from a signing tonight.
I haven't signed anybody in seven years.

316
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,328
My label's completely lost
all faith in me.

317
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,164
So why did you give me your card?

318
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,244
Force of habit. if I loOk homeless,
it's because I practically am.

319
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,164
I left my home about a year or so ago.

320
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,926
I'm sleeping on a shitty mattress
in some shitty apartment,

321
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,969
and I wasn't celebrating tonight.

322
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,487
I was drinking my ass off
standing on a subway platform

323
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,849
ready to kill myself,
and then I heard your song.

324
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,970
Want to get a beer?
Sure.

325
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,690
Ok, come on.

326
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,760
"Dan Mulligan. Born 1966.

327
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,764
Headed A&R department
at Island Records for two years.

328
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,685
Left to cofound indie label
Distressed Records

329
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,606
with Harvard classmate Saul Byron."
So you own Distressed Records?

330
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,411
I sold all my interests
due to emotional difficulties.

331
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:30,122
What emotional difficulties?
I was too emotional. Read on.

332
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,807
"Very active on the hiphop scene
in New York in the early '90s,

333
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,610
the pair were responsible
for discovering

334
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,209
numerous breakthrough artists.
Won two Grammys as producer.

335
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,328
Lives in New York
with wife, music journalist,

336
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,602
Miriam Hart, and their daughter."

337
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,087
What happened to the Grammys?
I pawned them.

338
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,120
You pawned them?
How much did you get for them?

339
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,403
$225 for the both of them,
which got me nice and wasted

340
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,609
one weekend a couple months ago.
Were you drunk when you heard my song?

341
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,161
Absolutely babe, that's when
the magic happens.

342
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,800
What magic?
I hear things.

343
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,764
You hear things?
Arrangements.

344
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,680
You need to be drunk
for that sort of thing.

345
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,411
You must've been drunk tonight,
because nobody else heard anything.

346
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,564
No, your song's good.
It's you.

347
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,048
Standing up there like a tomboy.
I don't mean to be offensive,

348
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,567
but don't you think that
loOk's a little passe?

349
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,324
Really?
Seriously.

350
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,841
We get you a loOk
and a killer video,

351
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,162
and you'll go straight to the top.

352
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,530
I'm thinking Norah Jones,
singersongwriter thing at a piano.

353
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,480
Or the...or The Cardigans,
back in the day, when they...

354
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,804
when they first came to America?
Maybe even Deborah Harry.

355
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,010
A male band behind you.
What? You find that amusing?

356
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,889
No, I'm sorry, something
went down the wrong way.

357
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,607
Sorry? No, you were saying? Me with
a cardigan on? Norah Jones?

358
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,331
Babe, who the fuck
do you think you are?

359
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,211
You're gonna stand up
on a stage with a beatup guitar

360
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,124
and you think you're
Carole fucking King?

361
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,362
No, I just think that an A&R man

362
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,002
telling an artist how they should dress
or come across is total bullshit.

363
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,083
People don't want that.
They want authenticity.

364
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,561
Ok, babe.
Authenticity.

365
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,760
Give me the name of one artist that
you think passes your authenticity test.

366
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,445
Dylan.
Dylan!

367
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,967
That is the most cultivated artist
you could've thought of.

368
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,482
His hair, his sunglasses.
He changes his loOk every decade.

369
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,246
Randy Newman.

370
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,927
I fucking love Randy Newman.
Ok? You got me on that.

371
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,320
Listen to me.

372
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,323
I am not saying that you can't be

373
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,404
a real bona fide motherfucker
in this business,

374
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,769
but you got to do whatever it takes
and get people in to see your shows,

375
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,844
where the music can start
to do its real work.

376
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,290
Oh, my God.
What are we even talking about?

377
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,643
You can't sign me,
and I don't want to be signed.

378
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,041
That's right!
What's not to like?

379
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,646
Come on, let's get out of here.

380
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,641
Ah, shit. You're gonna have to
get these beers, though.

381
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,645
Ok, so, uh...

382
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,646
It was really nice to meet you.
Oh. Where are you going?

383
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,009
To sleep.
I have a plane to catch tomorrow.

384
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,605
Where?

385
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,922
Home.
Why?

386
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,129
Because I'm sick of this city,
and I want to go back to Uni.

387
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,727
Oh, come on. Come on, no one
comes to New York and just leaves

388
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,168
without something terrible happening.
What? What happened to you?

389
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,849
Hey

390
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,369
Come on, you can...you can share
with me. I'm no stranger to misery.

391
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,364
Listen, just come to my label

392
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,330
and let me play your demo
to my partner.

393
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,723
If it doesn't work out, I will
personally pay to change your ticket.

394
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,087
What's one more day in New York,
for crying out loud?

395
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,561
You're just probably gonna go
home and mope around anyway.

396
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,520
All right, loOk,
I'm gonna go home and think about it,

397
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,810
and I'll call you
either way tomorrow. Ok?

398
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,724
Good answer.
Yeah.

399
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,089
It was very nice to meet you.
Yes, pleasure.

400
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,084
Pleasure's mine.
Hey, you...you got my number, right?

401
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,480
Yeah.

402
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,449
Hi! Dave?
Yes.

403
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,682
Hi. I'm Jill.
I work in hospitality at the label.

404
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,000
Nice to meet you.
You too.

405
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,680
Hello. I'm Gretta.
Nice to meet you.

406
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,841
Thanks.
You're welcome.

407
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,691
Right this way.
Thank you, Marco.

408
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,723
I think you're really
gonna like the apartment.

409
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,447
It's very highend.
Sorry, ladies.

410
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,809
Hey, I...I'm sorry. Are you, um...
You're Dave Kohl.

411
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,167
Yes. Yeah.
Yeah, I told you guys.

412
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,120
We just, um...we saw your film the
other day. I so love your songs in it.

413
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,567
Thank you very, very much.
This is Gretta, my girlfriend.

414
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,484
She writes songs, too.
Oh, cool.

415
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,769
Oh, would you mind taking a photograph.
That'd be so awesome.

416
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,729
Just that button right there.
Yeah.

417
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,124
Yeah, it's a good one.
Thank you!

418
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,400
All right, thank you.
Thank you so much, you guys.

419
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,970
You're gonna
have to get used to that.

420
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,003
This movie is selling out
all over town.

421
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,280
It's crazy.
Unbelievable.

422
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,361
Oh, no, it's real.

423
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,849
All right, here we are.
We hope you like.

424
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,243
So, uh, your fridge in here
is stocked with food.

425
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,562
There are two sets of keys
on the table in there.

426
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,606
This is your driver's number and my
cell phone number. I'll leave that here.

427
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,127
You're due at the label
later this afternoon

428
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,123
to meet everyone and say hi,

429
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,880
then we'll take a tour
around the studio.

430
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,169
So, probably want to catch up
on your sleep before then.

431
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,362
So I'll leave you to it, Ok?

432
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,000
Pleased to meet you, Gretta.
Nice to meet you, too. Thanks.

433
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,920
This place is a shit hole.

434
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,849
Biggest fridge I've ever seen.

435
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,131
Oh my God!
Come here.

436
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,282
Hey, can...

437
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,930
Can I ask you something?
Sure.

438
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,287
Should I have come over in,
like, a week or two

439
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,600
and let you settle in first
and get used to everything?

440
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,523
No.
Are you sure?

441
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,207
Yeah. I don't know if I could
do this without you. It's kind of scary.

442
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,407
Am I a wimp for saying that?
Eh...

443
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,369
Hey! There he is.
Big Dave.

444
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,488
What's up, kid?
How you doing, brother?

445
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,166
Good to see you. Gretta?
Nice to meet you.

446
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,321
Come on in, guys.

447
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,840
Put Dave at the head of the table.
All right, I like it.

448
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,760
You guys, you meet everyone?
Hi, everybody.

449
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,286
My assistant, Mim,
the beautiful Mim. This is, uh...

450
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,124
Mildred from marketing.
Hi.

451
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,282
Billy there is social media.

452
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,841
The rest of the gang
you'll meet, spend time with.

453
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,766
So, uh, Gretta, you're gonna play guitar
on a track or two, I hope, right?

454
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,729
Oh, yeah, sure.
I mean, if Dave wants.

455
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,600
Yeah, Gretta and I have been writing
together for a couple years now,

456
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,960
even before the film came along.

457
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,731
So I would love for us
to try a couple of her songs.

458
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,406
Did you...did you write
on the film with him?

459
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,562
No. No, no, no. No, I...
No?

460
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,927
I mean, that's the sound we're
after is from the movie, right?

461
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,121
Of course.
Oui?

462
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,770
Yes, yes.
Si? Capice?

463
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,003
Yes, I just, you know...Gretta's
very much a part of the inspiration

464
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,323
behind everything, you know,
so I just thought...

465
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,007
She's not just my girlfriend.
We're partners almost.

466
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,811
I just wanted to include her.
Um, just to be completely clear,

467
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,327
I'm...I'm just tagging along on this.

468
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,643
I'm really happy to be here
and more than happy

469
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,360
to accompany Dave
on a couple of tracks.

470
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,971
How sweet is this girl?
I love that.

471
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,202
Whew.

472
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,770
How great are these guys?
I love them.

473
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,726
Rolling Stone.

474
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,890
Yeah, thank you so much.

475
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,168
All right, it was
great talking to you. Thanks.

476
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,321
What's that?

477
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,244
That's matcha tea.
Matcha tea?

478
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,688
Yeah. It's got, like,
four million antioxidants in it.

479
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,810
Oh my God, it tastes like piss.
I like it.

480
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,849
Samurais used to drink it
before they went into battle.

481
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,764
You're not a samurai;
you're a songwriter.

482
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,127
Well, I'm kind of like a samurai.
Are you?

483
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,688
Ok, bring it back to the start.
Let me give these to the guys.

484
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,571
Oh, hey. We got to go
to LA for a week on Monday.

485
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,722
We're going to LA?
Uh, no, sorry.

486
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,962
It's just with some label guys.
They have an office there.

487
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,920
They want me to meet
this video director guy.

488
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,726
But in the meantime, I'd really
like you to listen to this. So yes?

489
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,526
Yes, I'm sorry. I'll, uh...
deliver coffee.

490
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,886
Ok.

491
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,807
Hey, guys, can we do this again, please?
You got it, Dave. Take two.

492
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,803
And rolling.

493
00:33:27,325 --> 00:33:31,273
# is everything just right #

494
00:33:31,356 --> 00:33:35,973
# don’t want you thinking’ #
# that i’m in a hurry #

495
00:33:36,046 --> 00:33:39,804
# i want to steal your friend #

496
00:33:39,925 --> 00:33:42,871
# but i had this vision #
# and it’s got me worried #

497
00:33:42,951 --> 00:33:47,853
# cause everyone wants someone #

498
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:51,847
# that’s one cliche that’s true #

499
00:33:51,936 --> 00:33:55,118
# the sad truth’s i want no one.. #

500
00:33:55,224 --> 00:33:58,792
# unless that someone’s you #

501
00:33:58,867 --> 00:34:02,684
# and loOks like you. feels like you #

502
00:34:02,733 --> 00:34:09,207
# smells like you, feels like you #
# smells like you, i want someone just like you #

503
00:34:09,356 --> 00:34:13,467
# through and through or i’m forever blue #

504
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:18,248
# cause there’s no one else like.. #

505
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,285
Thank you.

506
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,566
Oh my God!

507
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,007
Hello!
LoOk at you!

508
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,084
Oh my God!

509
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,284
He has the studio for three months,
and then we go on tour,

510
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,046
so I think we're staying for six?
This is unbelievable.

511
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,089
You're total rock stars.

512
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,765
Which studio is he working with?

513
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,530
Electric Lady.
Oh, fuck off.

514
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,045
I know.
Oh my...

515
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,440
Cool, isn't it?
Are you serious?

516
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,207
So, uh, this is me.
Aw, it's lovely.

517
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,365
It's like that old jOke. You put the key
in the door, you break a window.

518
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,124
My God, loOk at all this stuff.

519
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,170
Yeah, a lot of the studios,
uh, are upgrading.

520
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,529
So they're practically giving stuff
away. I can record an album here soon.

521
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,205
Well, that'd be cool.

522
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,164
LoOk at you.
You've got CDs.

523
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,842
Yeah, I just phased out
all my cassettes. Have a sit down.

524
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,562
It's very retro of you.
I have whiskey or water.

525
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,927
Whiskey, please.
Of course you will.

526
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,282
LoOk what you've got.

527
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,331
People are
going crazy for that here.

528
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,200
When I play a show, and the people
know I went to college in Bristol,

529
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,084
the first thing they ask
is if I know your boyfriend.

530
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,971
Tell me about it. I'm becoming
"Dave Kohl's girlfriend" back home.

531
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,487
I'm like, "Hello, we used to
be a team. What happened?"

532
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,444
Ah, you know what they say,
get your songs in a movie.

533
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,406
So this is me. This is where I've been
for God knows how long.

534
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,045
I love it. Yeah.
Do you?

535
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,009
Did you see the bed?
I made that bed.

536
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,889
That's impressive.
How do you get up there?

537
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,247
I vault. I vault.

538
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,566
You vault? With a pole?

539
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,643
No, no pole.
It's just, it's one...

540
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,087
I do it in one straight,
like, one straight luge.

541
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,806
Unless I'm drunk, in which...
in which case I...

542
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,121
it's often a dismount.

543
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,567
God.
It's the back I like.

544
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,688
It's like he's holding a guitar,

545
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,440
but he wants you
to think it's his penis.

546
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,921
He's saying,
"LoOk, it's a guitar, but it's not.

547
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,684
This is the actual size of my penis."

548
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,641
Why, no?

549
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,888
I am gonna shoot this
because you have to play that

550
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,120
the way you just played it.

551
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,249
Ok, you play the guitar, 'cause I can't
do that when that thing's on.

552
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,289
I will. Ok, where's...

553
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,966
It's in G.
I know G.

554
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,520
I don't like that.
I can play G.

555
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,085
It doesn't matter,
you have to get over this.

556
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,084
This is an exercise.
Yes. Ready?

557
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,606
Slower.

558

00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:23,554

Done.

577
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,003
What do you think?
What do I think?

578
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,009
I think...

579
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,690
I think I'm angry. I think I...

580
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,480
I think I'm mad at you
'cause it's so good

581
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,807
that I hate you a little bit.

582
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,411
So incredibly good.

583
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,005
Yeah?
Yeah.

584
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,969
Really?
Yeah, what's it called?

585
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,327
I don't know.
Um, "Lost Stars"?

586
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,209
You like it?
I...I don't like it.

587
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,805
I think it's...I love it,

588
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,167
and I think it's incredible,
and is it...

589
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,200
Is it about...It's about me? It's not
about your other boyfriend, right?

590
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,368
I don't know if it's about you,
but it's definitely for you.

591
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,320
I'll take it.
It's your Christmas present

592
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,482
'cause I can't afford to buy you
another one. Happy Christmas!

593
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,971
This is the only present I want.

594
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,124
Yeah? Happy Christmas.
Thank you very much.

595
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,203
I love you.
I love you.

596
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,449
Aah! Turn it off, turn it off,
turn it off, turn it off.

597
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,806
Hi.

598
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,607
I missed you.
I missed you.

599
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,045
What...what did you do?
Uh, nothing, really.

600
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,089
I just kind of hung around here.

601
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,242
I went to some botanical gardens.

602
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,925
Oh, really?
It was very lovely.

603
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,764
Nice.
Yeah, it was good.

604
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,001
I wrote a new song.

605
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,366
Did you?
Yeah.

606
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,925
I was inspired in LA.

607
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,525
Want to hear it?
Wow, yeah.

608
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,967
Would you be interested in that?
I'd be very interested in that.

609
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,122
I've got it right here.
How exciting.

00:40:12,914 --> 00:40:16,883
# all i know is i can’t keep on #

615
00:40:16,977 --> 00:40:21,014
# wearing this disguise #

616
00:40:21,103 --> 00:40:24,109
# when you’re the only one that sees #

617
00:40:24,205 --> 00:40:26,956
# worth real in my eyes #

618
00:40:27,052 --> 00:40:30,035
# you take me to another space and time #

619
00:40:30,113 --> 00:40:33,069
# you take me to a higher place #

620
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:37,338
# so i’m about to get out of the race #

621
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:37,894
# i don’t mind #

622
00:40:38,935 --> 00:40:39,915
# you ought to know that every.. #

623
00:40:40,056 --> 00:40:43,104
# there’s nothing if i don’t have you #

624
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,286
fuck!

625
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,445
what the fuck is wrong with you?

626
00:40:56,945 --> 00:41:06,445
# i don't know why i don't see happiness in this town
everyone i meet seems so uptight wearing they frown #

627
00:41:07,545 --> 00:41:09,045
# what good's living... #

628
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,129
You're like a fucking mind reader.

629
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,325
Who is it for?

630
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,241
Mim.

631
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,970
Mim from the label, Mim?

632
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,361
Mim...

633
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,363
Mim, who we met...

634
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,562
one month ago? Mim, Mim?

635
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,481
Yeah.

636
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,129
Was she in LA with you?

637
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,449
Yeah. Yeah.

638
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,643
I don't know what to say.

639
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,241
It just happened.
I...

640
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,841
Maybe it'll go away.
Maybe it'll fade.

641
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,287
I just...
I have to see it through.

642
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,961
Do you want to put your head
this end or this end?

643
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,248
Obviously...

644
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,885
Do you want a tea?

645
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,761
I don't remember
if you take sugar or...

646
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,604
I'm gonna wing it.
I'll wing it.

647
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,800
Please, won't you
come outwith me tonight?

648
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,048
I'm gonna play some songs
down at this open mic night.

649
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,761
Why don't you come with me?
'Cause I hate your fucking songs.

650
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,043
All right, I think we both know
that that isn't true, so...

651
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,771
Sorry, I didn't...No.
I...I love your songs.

652
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,331
I'm just...I...

653
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,328
I'm being fucking horrendous right now,
which is exactly why I need to, um...

654
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,686
I need to go home.

655
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,649
That's exactly why you need
to come with me.

656
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,609
Come on. I insist.

657
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,683
Uh...
Pick that up and come with me.

658
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,126
You're coming.
I'm not leaving you here.

659
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,324
I'll come back, I'll find your
fucking head in the oven. Come with me.

660
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,808
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
I have a friend here tonight.

661
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,361
And if it's Ok with you,
I was wondering

662
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,922
if you'd like her to come up here
and play one of her songs.

663
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,480
Yeah!
ls...is that Ok?

664
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,484
Yeah? Gretta, would you
come up here, please?

665
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,602
Hello?
Hey.

666
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,520
Were you serious last night
about signing me?

667
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,801
Who is this?

668
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,961
Really?

669
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,083
I'm jOking. Yeah, I was serious.

670
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,331
I have all my suits here.

671
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,721
Would you get me a nice suit
and make me loOk nice, princess?

672
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,008
Wait, you can't just...
I heard a song last night,

673
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,128
and I'm telling you,
it's exactly what that

674
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,640
shitass label needs.
I'm glad.

675
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,087
You can't just barge in here.
You can't come in like this.

676
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,969
Why?
Uh, because that's our arrangement.

677
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,000
You got somebody here?
That's not the point.

678
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,166
We have an arrangement.

679
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,845
Hello!
Stop it, will you?

680
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,490
Stray man! Any stray man!
It's not funny.

681
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,365
Don't worry about me,
it's just the husband taking a shower.

682
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,688
You can continue fucking my wife!
Hey.

683
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,922
That's not funny.
Hey, I'm sorry.

684
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,242
If I did, you'd be the first I'd tell.

685
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,044
Ok?
Oh, so you're not.

686
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,521
I'll get you a shirt and a...
No razor!

687
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,684
Stop it.
All right?

688
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,884
You want to come in?
You want sexy time?

689
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,764
No.

690
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,806
Ok, ready?

691
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,405
So where are we going, Mr. A&R Man?

692
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,767
We're going to my partner to play him
your music. Got your demo?

693
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,684
No.

694
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,808
You don't have a demo?
No.

695
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,769
Do you have MySpace
or FaceboOk or anything?

696
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,287
MySpace? No, I...
No, I don't. I just...

697
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,802
I...You know, I told you,
I write songs from time to time.

698
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,930
What do you write them for?
What do you mean, "what for"?

699
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,969
For my pleasure and for my cat.

700
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,043
Oh really?
Does he like them?

701
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,651
She. Yes, she seems to.

702
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,406
How do you know?
Because she purrs.

703
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,050
Maybe she's booing.

704
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,487
No, she purrs at Leonard Cohen, too,
and she has very good taste.

705
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,484
Maybe she's fucking with you.
Can we stop talking about cats now?

706
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,404
Ok.
Ok.

707
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,211
Fuck it. Let's do this
the oldfashioned way.

708
00:46:31,008 --> 00:46:35,374
# so find yourself at the subway #

709
00:46:35,768 --> 00:46:41,109
# with your world in a bag by your side #

710
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,081
Thank you, Gretta.
Thanks very much. Thanks for coming in.

711
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,040
I'm just gonna take
a moment to talk with Dan for a minute.

712
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,645
Thank you.

713
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,441
I'm not into it,
it's a little undercoOked for me.

714
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,001
She seems to have kind of
an attitude problem and...

715
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,128
What are you loOking for, man?

716
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,760
What, you want some...
some little teenage pop star

717
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,730
whose mom's been raising her
since two years old for stardom?

718
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,564
I mean...
No, that's not what I'm loOking for,

719
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,609
but if you know someone
like that, I mean...

720
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,446
Just give me the money to make the demo.
I'll take her into the studio.

721
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,888
Get a hotshit producer. Get a couple
session musicians, dial the thing out.

722
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,328
Then you can hear what I'm hearing,
and then you can tell me to fuck myself.

723
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,404
People send us their demos.
It's not the other way around.

724
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,210
We don't...we don't make demos.

725
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,489
We're prospectors, man,
we're investors.

726
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,051
We're digging for gold.

727
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,330
Make a tape,
and we'll get back to you.

728
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,244
That's the best I can
do right now, bro.

729
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,528
So I've been thinking.

730
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,564
Why do we even need
to rent a fucking studio?

731
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:03,766
Because...you need a desk,
a live room and soundproofing.

732
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,447
Laptop, Pro Tools,
a couple dynamic mics,

733
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,922
and the city is our fucking live room.
You mean record outside?

734
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,320
That's right.
Like where?

735
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,766
Everywhere.

736
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,686
Fuck him. We don't need a demo.
Let's...let's record an album.

737
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,088
Every song we do in a
different location.

738
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,846
All over New York City.
And we do it through the summer,

739
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,202
and it becomes this tribute
to this beautiful,

740
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,443
goddamn crazy, fractured mess
of a city, New York.

741
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,491
Ok, like, under the bridge
on the Lower East Side.

742
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,045
Top of the Empire State Building.

743
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,487
Rowing boats in the lake
in Central Park.

744
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,411
Chinatown. Cathedral
of Saint John the Divine.

745
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,365
Ok, in the subway,
in fucking Harlem, everywhere, Ok?

746
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,608
Ok, so what happens
if it starts raining?

747
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,524
Whatever happens, we record it.

748
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,365
If we get arrested?
Keep rolling. It'll be beautiful.

749
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,090
You like it?

750
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,162
What do you think?
It's good.

751
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,040
It's good. Come on.
Will you produce it?

752
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,207
Me?
Yeah.

753
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,850
No, I haven't produced
in a long time.

754
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,088
We'll get somebody young to produce it.

755
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,368
No, but I want you to do it.
Why?

756
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,329
Because I do.

757
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,488
I'll give you strings,
but we definitely need piano.

758
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,926
Fill in the guitars underneath.

759
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,889
Got it. I love it. Done.
Done.

760
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,089
The world's first Jag
mobile recording studio...

761
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,011
is done.

762
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,169
It's bloody genius, it is.
Where do you want to go?

763
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:26,882
We need musicians.
Terminally, miserably bored musicians.

764
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,204
And after that, I think,
then you bring in the violin and cello.

765
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,925
First cello, then violin.

766
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,286
When we get into that guitar thing,

767
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,640
I want it to just become
a whole different kind of song.

768
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,040
This is Malcolm.
Malcolm is a child prodigy.

769
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,931
He's been playing violin
since he was five years old.

770
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,082
I technically started when I was four.

771
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,321
Four.

772
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,881
Wow.
And this is his older sister, Rachel.

773
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,884
She's at the Manhattan School of Music
on a full scholarship.

774
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,691
Topofherclass cellist.
That's amazing.

775
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:06,208
So here's the deal.
I can't afford to pay you up front,

776
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,807
so I want to offer you a...
a legitimate backend deal.

777
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,450
Sound good?

778
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,841
Yeah, as long as it's
not fucking Vivaldi.

779
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,161
It's not fucking Vivaldi.

780
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,806
It's great. No, no, no.
I'm not...It's great.

781
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,442
We definitely need piano.
Like, fill in the guitar underneath.

782
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,126
Major seventh...
Got it. I love it.

783
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,366
Steve, beautiful.

784
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,127
Zach, what's going on?
I quit.

785
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,248
Good luck, girls.
Bye!

786
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,566
Keep in touch, yeah?

787
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,120
When we get into that guitar thing,

788
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,481
I want it to just become
a whole different kind of song.

789
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,325
I want it to be punk meets...

790
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,767
pop.
And have some fun.

791
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,083
Ah, he's home.

792
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,284
Dano, what's up, man?

793
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,563
Troublegum, my brother.
My troubles are over.

794
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,371
What say you give me some love?
This is it, gangsta paradise.

795
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,760
Right?
I'm glad to see you.

796
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,080
Thanks to you, thanks to you.

797
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,651
Come give me a hug.
I don't know you, but...

798
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,280
That's Gretta.
Great singer and songwriter.

799
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,960
Let's get another one.
Another one?

800
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,202
Where have you been?
It's been two or three years.

801
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,170
I don't appreciate this shit.
Been on the down low a little bit.

802
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,210
Doing this, doing that.
Waiting for the next move.

803
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,761
Anticipating the next groove.

804
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,008
I know you got a lot of
shit to prove. Right?

805
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,562
Been on the underground,
loOking for that new sound.

806
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,888
We ain't fucking around.

807
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,691
Yeah, 'cause if it ain't right,
then it's wrong.

808
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,285
And the road is long,

809
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,570
and you're only as strong
as your next move.

810
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,760
You feel that?
Good, man.

811
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,167
That's pretty much it.
Damn, that was like some...

812
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,931
paranormal activity
type shit moving through me.

813
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,606
You know me.
I'm just so happy to see you.

814
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,886
So nice.

815
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,360
Fat Jimmy, did you get that down?

816
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,880
Yeah, I got it.
'Cause that was exceptionally good.

817
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,526
Hold my hand, baby, come on.
Now, how can I help you, brother?

818
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,841
An outdoor album?

819
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,441
That's right.
That's fucking crazy.

820
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,682
I wish I could've thought of that.
What do you want me to do?

821
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,929
I need musicians.
I need a bass player and a drummer.

822
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,368
I got plenty of musicians.
The problem is we can't pay them.

823
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,201
Fuck it, I'll pay them.

824
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,089
Why?
What do you mean, why?

825
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,561
For him, of course.

826
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,891
Now, come on...
No.

827
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,929
Get your sexy self in the pool.
Come on.

828
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,809
No. Don't you touch me.
I will kill you. I will.

829
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,246
She's English.
She's a little uptight.

830
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,129
Yeah...

831
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,451
Good luck on the album, Gretta.
Thank you.

832
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,127
Everything you see around here,
this crib, these cars,

833
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,443
they're all because of him,
and I don't ever forget that.

834
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,523
I get it.
No, no, no, no, no.

835
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,330
You can't know.

836
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,086
A guy like that falls on his lip
for a couple of years,

837
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,084
people lose sight of who he is,
and they don't treat him

838
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,400
with the respect he deserves.

839
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,245
Hey, don't listen to anything
he's saying. It's bullshit.

840
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,607
Come on.
Yeah.

841
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,125
Thanks.
All right.

842
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,282
Bye.
Bye.

843
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,290
Anything you need, Ok?
I love you, man. Thank you.

844
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,641
I like her.

845
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:45,330
Are you serious?
Are you listening to this? Really?

846
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,768
We're gonna use it!
It's gonna be genius.

847
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,880
You're a genius.
You're not listening to this.

848
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,280
You don't hear what I hear.

849
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,169
You're gonna make this
amazing, beautiful.

850
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,368
I love it.
Got it?

851
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,044
Those kids are gonna be
all over this track.

852
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,770
Come here.
Just so you know.

853
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,121
Take that.

854
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,207
Little children,
yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

855
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,850
Let me see this for a second.

856
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,525
Listen, I'm shooting
a song down here,

857
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,240
I need you to be
quiet for five minutes.

858
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,850
No, thanks.
I'll...I'll pay you.

859
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,161
How much?
A buck each.

860
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,931
You're funny. Five dollars.
Five bucks for all of you guys.

861
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,322
Ok, hey, Ok, two bucks,
two bucks each.

862
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,641
No.
No way.

863
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,087
All right, all right,
all right, five bucks each.

864
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,600
We're gonna do this for five bucks

865
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,121
and five lollipops,
one for each of us.

866
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,282
Throw in a box of
cigarettes and a lighter.

867
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,125
I'll give you one cigarette
for each of you to smOke

868
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,362
and you share it,
and a pack of matches, all right?

869
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,682
Yes.
All right. Can you sing?

870
00:54:59,822 --> 00:55:05,804
# when you were asleep and i was out walking #

871
00:55:05,901 --> 00:55:07,913
# the voices started to speak #

872
00:55:09,804 --> 00:55:14,026
# and they wouldn’t stop talking #

873
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:14,831
# there were signs all around #

874
00:55:16,842 --> 00:55:19,828
# it really got my mind racing #

875
00:55:19,925 --> 00:55:22,045
# you were right all along #

876
00:55:23,134 --> 00:55:25,861
# something’s gotta change #

877
00:55:29,777 --> 00:55:31,091
# hold on #

878
00:55:32,125 --> 00:55:34,904
# hold on. they’re not for me #

879
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,029
# hold on #

880
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:45,050
# cause everything’s coming up roses #

881
00:55:48,976 --> 00:55:51,041
# roses #

882
00:55:54,622 --> 00:55:57,013
# now we’re back on the street #

883
00:55:58,112 --> 00:56:01,823
# for a song that’s worth singing.. #

884
00:56:01,933 --> 00:56:04,050
# the bloody nose of defeat #

885
00:56:05,103 --> 00:56:08,876
# why are your victory bells ringing #

886
00:56:08,988 --> 00:56:11,029
# oh life’s turned around #

887
00:56:12,065 --> 00:56:15,853
# for this thing you keep chasing #

888
00:56:15,951 --> 00:56:17,050
# you were right all along #

889
00:56:18,327 --> 00:56:22,108
# but it’s me who’s got to change #

890
00:56:24,802 --> 00:56:25,902
# hold on #

891
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:30,292
# hold on. they’re not for me #

892
00:56:30,588 --> 00:56:32,888
# hold on #

893
00:56:32,957 --> 00:56:41,119
# cause everything’s coming up roses #

894
00:56:41,388 --> 00:56:44,123
# hold on, hold on #

895
00:56:44,208 --> 00:56:46,124
# hold on, hold on #

896
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:48,561
# hold on, hold on #

897
00:56:49,301 --> 00:56:51,468
# hold on, hold on #

898
00:56:52,866 --> 00:56:55,710
# hold on, hold on #

899
00:56:57,148 --> 00:56:59,252
# hold on, hold on #

900
00:57:00,074 --> 00:57:03,918
# hold on, hold on #

901
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,766
Yes! Yes, that was it.

902
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,490
Yes, it's gonna work!

903
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,728
Oh my God,
is that the Empire State?

904
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,450
Yeah, right here.

905
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,090
Yeah?
Set up here.

906
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,481
Get that.
It's really good.

907
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,166
Yeah, it's great.
The Wind's good, right?

908
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,084
It's not too loud.
It's good, it's good,

909
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,446
I think it's good.

910
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,171
And we can loOk into people's windows,
which is always fun.

911
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,845
You want to come with me
to get Violet?

912
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,206
Is that Ok?
Yeah, come on.

913
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,125
Cool.
My brother, there you go.

914
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,725
Thank you very much.

915
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,607
There she is.
That's her.

916
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,051
This is Gretta. She's the songwriter
I was telling you about.

917
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,407
Hello. How you doing?
My daughter, Violet.

918
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,085
So who was the cute guy?
The one in the blue shirt.

919
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,289
Greg. You noticed him?
Sure. I mean, who wouldn't?

920
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,609
He's gorgeous.
He's totally out of our league.

921
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,161
He's out of your league?

922
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,761
Well, I mean, he didn't loOk out
of your league.

923
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,531
Ignore him.

924
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,843
How do you get someone to notice you're
ignoring them if they're ignoring you?

925
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,281
He's not ignoring you.
You're beautiful.

926
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,284
He knows that you're there.
He's just hedging his bets.

927
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,408
But...

928
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,006
I mean, you have to be really sure
that you actually like him, you know.

929
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,845
That's it's not just that
he's the guy at school to be seen with.

930
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,286
No, I do really like him.

931
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,800
Well, then you have to find a way
to get him to ask you out.

932
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,611
Yes, but how?

933
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,287
Well, for starters, stop dressing
like you're totally easy.

934
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,641
I thought this was sort of sexy,
it's American Apparel.

935
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,531
No, it is sort of sexy.
It's very, very sexy,

936
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:19,526
but it doesn't leave much
to the imagination, you know?

937
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,005
I guess.

938
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,891
You want to go shopping?

939
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,121
I do.

940
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,281
Yeah?
Yeah.

941
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,922
Ok, good.
We're going shopping.

942
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:42,841
Here you go.

943
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,161
Thank you.
Yeah.

944
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,606
Good luck on the rest of your album.

945
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,205
It sounds cool.
Thank you.

946
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,727
You have your key?
Yep. I got it.

947
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,723
Hey, you should come
and sing on a track.

948
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,566
I can't sing.
I can play a bit of guitar,

949
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,480
if that's...
We're doing one on Thursday.

950
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,240
It's gonna be simple.
You should come play.

951
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,646
Can I, Dad?

952
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,882
I need to...
I need to contemplate that.

953
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,441
What are you doing?

954
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,204
That ain't cool.
What? What?

955
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,490
I don't know if she can play guitar
well enough to play on a track.

956
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,927
I don't want to embarrass her.
What if she can't play?

957
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,162
LoOk, it's going to be easy.
Let her do it.

958
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,449
Yeah?

959
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,046
Hey, babe? Hey.

960
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:41,570
Um, where's Violet?
Well, she's...Violet?

961
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,041
Listen, I was wondering, uh,

962
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,846
you think it would be cool
if she came and played guitar

963
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,369
on one of these songs
that I'm recording on Thursday?

964
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,760
She's terrible at guitar.

965
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,520
Well, she's not bad.
She's terrible.

966
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,722
I think she'll be Ok.

967
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,969
Well, she's...
Yeah. 5:00, will you bring her?

968
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,485
I mean, that's up to you.

969
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:04,000
Yeah. I'll text you the address.
I mean, I'll bring her.

970
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,849
Why don't you come, too?

971
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,922
Mmmm.

972
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,082
Come on.
No way.

973
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,846
Come on.
Just come. It'll be fun.

974
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,891
I want you to come.
I'll think about it. Ok.

975
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,610
I'll come, maybe.

976
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,046
Thank you.
All right.

977
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,611
Bye.
Thank you.

978
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,046
Bye.

979
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:41,330
You know, it was nice
to see you with Violet today.

980
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,807
It must be hard not seeing her more.
Yeah, it's...

981
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,927
So why don't you?

982
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:54,209
I mean, she obviously
really needs her father around.

983
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,408
What, are you the fucking
social services now?

984
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,688
No, no, I mean, I'm just saying.

985
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,805
It must have been fairly tense
for you to leave,

986
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,360
especially seeing as how much
she obviously wants you around.

987
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,363
I...I'm gonna split.
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

988
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,566
Fuck, man.
Fuck that shit.

989
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,050
Dan.

990
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,886
Hey, loOk, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

991
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:38,567
What? What do you want from me?
What game are you playing?

992
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,449
What does that mean?

993
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,170
LoOk, I just...

994
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,328
What?
I saw how sweet she was today,

995
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,480
and I just felt sorry
for you being away from that.

996
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:49,000
That is such a crock of shit.
You were back there judging me.

997
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,929
You think that I left
that relationship

998
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,566
because I'm some sort
of selfish, depressed prick,

999
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,290
which I am, by the way.
No. I don't think

1000
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,080
you're a selfish, depressed prick.
I think you've let your troubles

1001
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:01,209
get in the way of your entire life.
Oh, babe, babe.

1002
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,044
You're really showing
your age right now.

1003
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,931
You have no idea what happens
between two people

1004
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,844
after 18 years of marriage,
all right?

1005
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,004
And because you're willing
to hang around for some asshole

1006
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,323
after he totally betrayed you,
that's your business.

1007
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,527
I'm sorry, you're right.

1008
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,569
I put a lot of time and
effort into that relationship,

1009
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,240
and no, I'm not just walking away
because of a bump in the road!

1010
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:23,403
"Bump in the road"?
I left that relationship

1011
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,562
because I was having
a fucking nervous breakdown,

1012
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,688
and she was out there
fucking some other guy,

1013
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,880
planning how she was gonna start
a new life with him

1014
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,241
when I was here taking care of my kid.

1015
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,085
You have no fucking clue
what you're talking about.

1016
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,083
You know nothing!

1017
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,766
She goes to Europe
to work on a junket, and, um...

1018
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,720
she ends up meeting
and falling in love with a singer.

1019
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,611
Bang, boom. Thunder, lightning.

1020
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:03,445
Fireworks. The whole bit.

1021
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:04,806
And...

1022
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,691
the arrangement was
that they were gonna come back

1023
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,207
and tell their partners
that they'd fallen in love

1024
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:12,727
and they were gonna spend
the rest of their lives together.

1025
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,770
And so, I go to the airport
to pick her up,

1026
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,606
and she just comes outwith it,
first off. Whole story.

1027
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,764
And next day, her bags are all packed,

1028
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,122
and we're telling Violet
what's gonna happen.

1029
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,486
So what did happen?

1030
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,688
He chOked.
He got on the airplane,

1031
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,087
went back to his life,
turned his phone off,

1032
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:34,562
and she never heard from him again.
I move into another bedroom.

1033
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,081
She's waiting around for
a phone call that never comes,

1034
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,129
and I turn into a...

1035
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,527
I lose my shit a little bit.

1036
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,561
I'm so sorry.
No.

1037
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:54,169
Maybe people in the music industry
just don't make good life partners.

1038
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:58,211
Or fathers.
Yeah, it certainly loOks that way.

1039
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,650
I didn't mean about the fathers bit.
You make a very good father.

1040
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,643
Yeah, right.
Maybe just not a good partner.

1041
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,125
What is that?

1042
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,281
This?
Yeah.

1043
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,726
That's a splitter.
Oh.

1044
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,360
It's for, uh, two headphones
going into one input.

1045
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,722
Yeah.
It's actually...

1046
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,123
from my first date with Miriam.
It is?

1047
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:25,441
What do you mean?

1048
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:29,969
We walked all over the city
listening to her CD player.

1049
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,281
Um...

1050
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,728
I don't think we said more than
two words to each other the whole night.

1051
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,770
That was New Year's Eve,
and we were married two months later.

1052
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,606
Wow.
That's lovely.

1053
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,360
What kind of music you got
on your phone?

1054
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,760
I'm not giving you access
to my music library. I'm really not.

1055
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,203
There's a lot of embarrassing,
very guilty pleasures in there.

1056
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:53,887
Mine, too. You can tell a lot about
a person by what's on their playlist.

1057
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,486
I know you can.
That's what's worrying me.

1058
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,571
So are we gonna do this?
Ok.

1059
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,500
Ok, let's do it.

1060

[LUCK BE A LADY BY FRANK SINATRA]

1073
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:08,641
What?
We got to dance!

1074
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:09,801
All right, all right.

1075
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,445
Yeah, we got to...
Where?

1076
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,045
We got to dance.

1077
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,806
This way, I know, I know, I know.
This way.

1078
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:20,806
# Someone warm like you #
# Would make my dreams come true #

1079
01:07:24,906 --> 01:07:36,906
# For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love, I can make it #

1080
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,000
# For once in my life, I have someone who needs me #

1081
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:19,885
Ok, so, I'm quite frightened,
'cause you might find this cheesy,

1082
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:23,328
but it is one of my favorite songs
from one of my favorite films,

1083
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,482
so are you ready?

1084
01:08:25,582 --> 01:08:27,182
[A KISS IS JUST A KISS BY HERMAN HUPFELD]

1085
01:08:27,182 --> 01:08:32,460
# You must remember this #
# A kiss is just a kiss #

1086
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,005
It's good, right?

1087
01:08:34,105 --> 01:08:43,805
# a sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply #

1088
01:08:43,905 --> 01:08:52,905
# As time goes by
And when two lovers woo #

1089
01:08:53,900 --> 01:09:00,900
#They still say, "I love you" #
# On that you can rely #



1090
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:03,883
That's what I love about music.

1091
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,202
What?
One of the most banal scenes

1092
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,091
is suddenly invested
with so much meaning, you know?

1093
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,605
All these banalities,

1094
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,524
they're suddenly turned
into these...

1095
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:16,401
these beautiful, effervescent pearls.

1096
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,164
From music.

1097
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:21,000
# Never out of date
Hearts full of passion #

1098
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:26,800
# Jealousy and hate #
# Woman needs man #

1099
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:29,460
# And man must have his mate #

1100
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:33,884
I've got to say, as I've gotten older,
these pearls are just...

1101
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:38,129
becoming increasingly
more and more rare to me.

1102
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,487
More string than pearls?

1103
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,811
Yeah. You've got to travel
over a lot more string

1104
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,530
to get to the pearls.

1105
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,368
This moment is a pearl, Gretta.

1106
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,841
It sort of is, isn't it?

1107
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,441
All this has been a pearl.

1108
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,291
Hey, guys!

1109
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,603
Hi.
Hello, Steve.

1110
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:30,723
Come on and check it out.
Your boyfriend just won a Music Gong.

1111
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,611
No way.
You won't believe it.

1112
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,410
Done something to his face.

1113
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,688
Wow, thank you so much.

1114
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,969
I'm a bit taken aback by this.
This is incredible.

1115
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,806
Uh, it just proves that a guy
from nowhere can actually make it

1116
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,770
if he follows his dreams.

1117
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,287
I've been practicing this speech
into a shampoo bottle

1118
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:54,445
in the shower my entire life.
Yeah...

1119
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:59,411
Uh, gosh, thank you.
Nice beard, you fucking loser.

1120
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,642
What dreams? We never
had those dreams.

1121
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,087
I don't remember those dreams.
How do you know?

1122
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,248
Because I know him.

1123
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,721
Maybe they were private dreams.

1124
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,480
Maybe he just never told you about them.

1125
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:14,208
Who was I living with
for the last five years?

1126
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,203
Baby, you've been living
with a rock star.

1127
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,566
Only he didn't know it.

1128
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,768
It didn't matter,
but now that he does,

1129
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,042
I've got to tell you,
these people get married to it.

1130
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,567
They fall in love with the music,
they fall in love with the lights,

1131
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:27,564
they fall in love with the road,
the chicks, all that shit.

1132
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,808
And no matter how hard he tries,

1133
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:32,770
he's never gonna be able
to make a woman happy.

1134
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:37,244
All right.
See you in the morning.

1135
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,725
He just loOks a dick!

1136
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,564
Why would he do that?
I don't know.

1137
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,643
Why would anyone?
I'll tell you why he'd do it.

1138
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,849
He wants to loOk like the guy who
doesn't realize..."I've grown a beard.

1139
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,082
I was so busy lost inside
myself writing music,

1140
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:53,489
I didn't realize I'd grown
a beard the size of my neck."

1141
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:56,371
I'm gonna sound
quite cheesy over it.

1142
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,761
I loved him like a fool.

1143
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:02,964
I don't think that's cheesy. I think
that sounds like a phenomenal song.

1144
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,929
Does it?
Yeah, it sounds like a song.

1145
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,048
I think it sounds like
a song you should write right now.

1146
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,440
Right now?
Write it down.

1147
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,364
Write it down, write it down.
Ok, Ok.

1148
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,521
You're in the zone.

1149
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,290
Say, "I'm in the zone."
I'm in the zone.

1150
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,044
Don't say it like
a posh English girl,

1151
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,725
say it like someone in New York.
Fuck off!

1152
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,245
Say, "I'm in the fucking zone."

1153
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,209
I'm in the fucking zone.
I'm in the fucking zone.

1154
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,885
I'm gonna write a song,
I don't give a shit.

1155
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,041
I'm gonna write a song.

1156
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,646
Actually shut up.
All right, I'm shushing...

1157
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,121
Ok, dialing.

1158
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,322
All right, here we go.
Speaker.

1159
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,562
Hey, this is Dave Kohl.

1160
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,849
Uh, I am probably busy doing something
awesome, so leave me a message

1161
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,890
and I probably won't be able
to get back to you at all, ever.

1162
01:12:50,139 --> 01:12:54,108
# we take a chance from time to time.. #

1163
01:12:58,722 --> 01:13:01,891
# and put our necks out on the line #

1164
01:13:07,126 --> 01:13:10,108
# and you have brOken every promise.. #

1165
01:13:10,149 --> 01:13:12,916
# that we made #

1166
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:18,822
# and i have loved you anyway #

1167
01:13:26,139 --> 01:13:34,127
# toOk a fine time to leave me #
# hanging out to dry #

1168
01:13:34,212 --> 01:13:38,253
# understand now i’m grieving.. #

1169
01:13:38,321 --> 01:13:42,160
# so don’t you waste my time #

1170
01:13:43,850 --> 01:13:46,274
# cause you have taken.. #

1171
01:13:46,316 --> 01:13:50,347
# all the wind out from my sails #

1172
01:13:50,417 --> 01:13:55,918
# and i have loved you just the same #

1173
01:13:57,084 --> 01:14:01,108
# we finally find this, then you’re gone #

1174
01:14:05,118 --> 01:14:09,222
# been chasing rainbows all along #

1175
01:14:14,352 --> 01:14:20,167
# and you have cursed me #
# when there’s no one left to blame #

1176
01:14:22,216 --> 01:14:25,455
# and i have loved you just the same #

1177
01:14:51,108 --> 01:14:53,160
# and you have brOken #

1178
01:14:53,201 --> 01:14:57,139
# every single fucking rule #

1179
01:14:59,129 --> 01:15:03,201
# and i have loved you like a fool #

1180
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:11,409
One more?

1181
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,081
Hey

1182
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:29,363
Everybody, this is, uh...
this is Miriam.

1183
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:30,561
This is Gretta.

1184
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,802
This is my daughter, Violet.
Nice to meet you.

1185
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:33,961
Come on, babe.

1186
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:37,126
Miriam, thank you.
Thank you.

1187
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,481
It's not too high, is it?

1188
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,722
That's not too high for a bass.
Exactly.

1189
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,400
No one should play bass
unless it's this high.

1190
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,921
You want me to set your amp
or are you good? Ok.

1191
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:50,169
No, no, no, no, no! Hold up,
hold up, hold up, hold up...

1192
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,483
Rachel, at the top, or...
yeah, at the top,

1193
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,080
come in a little bit more gradually.

1194
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,328
Fat Jimmy, come on, man.
What's up?

1195
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,528
All right, man, all right.
Police ain't gonna get you up here.

1196
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,250
Let's hear that bass, my brother.

1197
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,160
I got you, baby, I got you.
Come on, man.

1198
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,810
I'm sorry, wait a minute.
Um, do you play bass?

1199
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,360
You were out of tune.
You were flat.

1200
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,847
'Cause I read on the Internet
that you used to play bass.

1201
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,480
So, um, I think seeing
as we've got Violet

1202
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,041
doing some guitar on this,
this should be a family affair.

1203
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,567
I'm a producer
'cause I don't play bass, baby.

1204
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:19,326
Yes, you are...
You got to do it.

1205
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:20,891
You got to do it...

1206
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,883
All right, all right.

1207
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,327
Come in whenever you want, you know?
You can wait.

1208
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:26,891
Just, you know, keep it simple.

1209
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,769
Ok.
You're gonna be great.

1210
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:31,002
I don't even know if I'm gonna play.
Whatever.

1211
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,288
If you feel like it, do it, Ok?

1212
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:34,646
You know, it's totally cool.

1213
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,041
You know, but don't feel like
you have to overdo it

1214
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,726
or prove anything.
These guys are serious musicians.

1215
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,321
Guys, can we...
Sorry. Can we take five?

1216
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:45,802
All right, let's take five.
Five, not ten.

1217
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,683
Hey.
I'm back in New York for a gig.

1218
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:55,208
I got your singing message.
I have to see you.

1219
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,125
Uh, call me.
Please call me.

1220
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:16,875
# oh maybe you don’t have to kill so kind #

1221
01:18:16,959 --> 01:18:22,712

Turn down that motherfucking music!
Give us three more minutes!

1245
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:35,886
I'm calling the cops!
You're not calling the cops!

1246
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:21,246
Oh my God!
Oh, Violet!

1247
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:31,764
And now the police!
Come on, let's go.

1248
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,729
Hello.
Congratulations.

1249
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:51,366
Thank you. We should have
a toast right now.

1250
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,524
To your album?
To our album.

1251
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:02,044
Really?
All right. Don't get too excited.

1252
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,567
I'm just trying it out.
Ok.

1253
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,568
Should we toast with that?

1254
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,402
Goddamn, how do people drink that?

1255
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,450
We're gonna play a game, Ok?

1256
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:28,650
We're gonna play a song
that is impossible to not dance to.

1257
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,202
I defy you not to dance to this song.

1260
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,131
This is good.
This is good!

# When I'm sleeping I've got you in my dreams #

You know you want to.
You know you want to!

1263
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:53,285
You know you want to.
So where is it?

1264
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:57,568
You know you want to.
You do, you do.

1265
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:00,200

I'll see you.

1272
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,444
I'm gonna give them a ride home.

1273
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,681
Cool.
Good night.

1274

Good night.

1275
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,931
Bye.
Thank you for everything.

1276
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:54,525
No, thank you for everything.

1277
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:57,729
See you.
Bye!

1278
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:00,120
Good night, Gretta.
Good night, Gretta.

1279
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:03,289
It's gonna be awesome.

1280
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,929
So, how was touring?

1281
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:48,448
Touring was amazing,
grueling, punishing,

1282
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:50,927
inspiring.
Did you find yourself?

1283
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:52,881
I don't know.

1284
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,646
You certainly found a beard, anyway.
LoOk at that thing.

1285
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,928
Yeah.
It's...it's intense.

1286
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,650
It's big.
Yeah.

1287
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,761
Did Mim go with you?
On tour?

1288
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,524
You want to go straight into this, then?

1289
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:08,841
Yeah?
Are you...

1290
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:12,726
are you the happiest couple ever?
Or did you...break up after a month

1291
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:14,604
and she came back
to New York on a bus?

1292
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:19,527
It was a train...actually.

1293
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:21,885
I'm sorry.
I'm being a bitch.

1294
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:25,089
No. You're entitled.

1295
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:31,405
So...
what have you been up to?

1296
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:39,406
God...

1297
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:42,370
It's...amazing, Gretta.

1298
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:43,965
Really?
Totally.

1299
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:47,408
Ambient sound, and...the city.

1300
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,285
That's it?
No overdubs? Nothing?

1301
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:52,080
No, no, no, it's just
the way you hear it.

1302
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:54,521
God, it's so great.
Yeah.

1303
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:57,411
They're really offering you a deal?
No...well, I don't know.

1304
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:02,248
He has to play it to his
partner first. So we'll see.

1305
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:05,687
I cannot believe
what he's done with your songs.

1306
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,126
I know. He's amazing.

1307
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:10,841
You should get him to do your record.
No, it's too late.

1308
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,810
We just finished mastering
the record in LA.

1309
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,724
I recorded in various
studios on the road.

1310
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:19,965
Wow. So, what's it called?
"On the Road."

1311
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:22,600
Oh.

1312
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,888
Kind of like Kerouac.

1313
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,249
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

1314
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,209
That's actually a
terrible album name.

1315
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,169
No, I...

1316
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:36,563
I mean, it worked for him.
No. It's bad.

1317
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:39,326
It's...
I know that you know it's bad, too.

1318
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,448
No, I'm...

1319
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:45,002
you know...
Anyway, would you like to go hear it?

1320
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:47,481
I would love to hear it.
Ok.

1321
01:26:47,687 --> 01:26:52,615
# but are we all lost stars #

1322
01:26:52,756 --> 01:26:56,810
# trying to light up the dark #

1323
01:26:57,931 --> 01:27:01,542
# and i thought i saw you out there crying #

1324
01:27:03,708 --> 01:27:05,998
# and i thought i heard you call my name #

1325
01:27:06,077 --> 01:27:10,656
# and i thought i heard you out there crying #

1326
01:27:10,698 --> 01:27:11,877
# oh, just the same #

1327
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:18,244
All right...
what do you think?

1328
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:22,088
I think I need to listen to it again.

1329
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:25,483
No. No, I want...
I want your immediate reaction.

1330
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:27,642
My immediate reaction?
Mmhmm.

1331
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:30,046
Ok, um...

1332
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:34,489
I...I think that you've lost
the songs in the production.

1333
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:37,160
You know?
I mean, Ok, take "Lost Stars."

1334
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:40,483
I wrote it as a...as a ballad,
and...I don't know,

1335
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:42,802
it sounds like a piece of stadium pop.
Ooh.

1336
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,201
Yeah, but I wanted to
turn it into a hit.

1337
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:47,880
Why?
"Why?" What kind of question is that?

1338
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:50,120
You're the writer.
You get sole writing credit on it.

1339
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:52,447
This is huge for you.
Yeah, but, I mean,

1340
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:56,605
you weren't supposed to lose the song
in it, you know? I mean, it's...

1341
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:59,491
it's delicate.
I really...I just...

1342
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:01,085
I think you should get it remixed.

1343
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:03,360
Ah, but everyone loves it
when we do it. It's amazing.

1344
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:04,925
You have to come see it live.

1345
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:07,367
The reaction to it,
the energy in the room just changes.

1346
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,409
Why are you so worried
about what other people think?

1347
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,244
It's...it's our song.

1348
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:13,480
It is, but, you know,
isn't that what music is about?

1349
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:16,410
It's about sharing it with people.
No, not that song, Dave.

1350
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:19,763
Ok, well, good, then
who do we get to remix this?

1351
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,649
Mim. Maybe you should
get Mim to remix it.

1352
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:24,804
Really? Ok, so this is obviously
not anything about the album.

1353
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,007
You think?

1354
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:31,604
Don't. Don't become this, like,

1355
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:33,603
music biz couple, you know?

1356
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:36,764
Arguing about our, um...
our albums.

1357
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:42,767
The funny thing about this is that I'd
throw that fucking record into the ocean

1358
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:45,167
if we could just continue
this conversation right now.

1359
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,561
This is what I want to
talk about. Ok?

1360
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:50,769
And if I could somehow
say something or do anything

1361
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:53,400
that would undo
what I did to us, then...

1362
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:56,006
just tell me what it is.
Help me.

1363
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,040
Would you?

1364
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,248
Would you throw it in the ocean?

1365
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,682
Would you...
would you want me to?

1366
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,968
No.

1367
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:15,367
No, I just,
you know, I think...

1368
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:21,567
I think everything's changed.

1369
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:25,327
And I'm...I'm just
finding it a bit hard to adjust.

1370
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:27,960
I know. It makes sense.

1371
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:30,043
But we're just gonna have
to find a way to...

1372
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,567
get through this,
get through this together.

1373
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,362
When did you, like,
when did you realize that?

1374
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:38,841
When you sang to me on my voicemail.

1375
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,480
I realized that nobody on Earth
in their right mind

1376
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:46,009
would ever do anything remotely
like that, and...that killed me.

1377
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:48,766
That crushed me.
You...

1378
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:50,809
completely won me over.

1379
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:54,009
I wasn't trying to win you over,
I was trying to tell you to fuck off.

1380
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:56,089
And I had. And...

1381
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:00,291
and now, you know, you've...
you've come back and...

1382
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:04,880
and you've opened the whole thing up
again, and I think, actually, I think...

1383
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,606
I think I'm gonna have to go.
Um, take that.

1384
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:10,081
I'm gonna go, 'cause it's all a bit much.

1385
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:12,402
I hear you. Just...

1386
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:16,042
take your time.
I'm not going anywhere.

1387
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:18,806
You're gonna stay on the bench?
Yes, I'm gonna live on this bench.

1388
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,883
Uhhuh.

1389
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,085
Come to the Gramercy.

1390
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:26,242
On Saturday. Please.

1391
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:30,525
Just hear the song.
I want you to see...

1392
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:33,763
how everyone's just falling
in love with what you created.

1393
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,809
Please don't play it like that.

1394
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:42,726
Ok.

1395
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:57,401
Well, loOk at you. A vision of
pure class. There's my daughter.

1396
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:00,726
No way.
There it is.

1397
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:01,881
Is this it?
Yeah.

1398
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,922
There you are.
Yeah.

1399
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:07,923
You loOk great.
LoOk how cool you are.

1400
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,605
Can I keep this?
Show all my friends?

1401
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,569
Hell, yeah.
That's what it's for, babe.

1402
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:14,769
LoOk at you. Hilarious.
Why is that hilarious?

1403
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:17,571
I just had no idea
you were that talented.

1404
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,210
I mean, I just didn't know.

1405
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,362
You're, like...
you're a real guitar player.

1406
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:23,727
You got...you got some talent.
Seriously.

1407
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:26,042
What, do you want me to
start a band now, and...?

1408
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:27,850
Yeah. Let's start a band.

1409
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,122
"Let's start a band"?
Yeah. Why not?

1410
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:31,930
I'll record you.
I'll produce you.

1411
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:33,445
I like this idea.

1412
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,125
Do you?
Yeah.

1413
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:37,851
You all...motivated now?

1414
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,765
It's a family business.
It's like the Jackson Five.

1415
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:44,129
There you go.
The Mulligan Three.

1416
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:46,009
You coming in?
No. I'm gonna go...

1417
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:48,162
I'm gonna go play that for Saul,
see if we can get a deal.

1418
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,641
Good luck.
Let me know how it goes.

1419
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:54,207
I love you.

1420
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,525
I know you do.

1421
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:03,601
Hey

1422
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:08,801
Come on.
Yeah. So pretty.

1423
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,290
Bye.

1424
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:24,647
Thanks for coming in, guys.

1425
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,962
This is fantastic.
You got a great record.

1426
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:30,761
And...I missed it on the first listen,
but I don't want to miss it again.

1427
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:33,730
We're very glad that
you like it. So...

1428
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:37,123
Well, I reached out to some
of my studio connects in LA,

1429
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:38,924
and I was thinking
we can get the first track

1430
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:41,447
placed in a...in a film,
the right film.

1431
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,250
There's also pilot season right now.

1432
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,323
Yeah, we're not interested
in any of that stuff.

1433
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:50,327
Ok, so then...what are you
interested in? What are we doing here?

1434
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:53,131
Well, I think Dan needs his job back.

1435
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:56,923
Yeah, sure. What?
Take my office. I don't care.

1436
01:32:58,040 --> 01:33:00,042
Ok, all right, so how, I mean...

1437
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,964
I guess I want to know...
how does this work?

1438
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:05,442
We put the album out,
we sell it for...?

1439
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:08,530
Let's say an album
costs ten dollars a unit.

1440
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:10,648
The artist gets a dollar.

1441
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,451
Same in publishing...
it's a buck for a boOk.

1442
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,762
I think I'm just thinking
for this specifically...

1443
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,046
to get my head around it...

1444
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:19,407
Um, I mean, the album,
it doesn't have any overhead,

1445
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,642
because...we did it.
Yeah.

1446
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:24,644
And then distribution,
I mean, it's not gonna go in stores,

1447
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:28,361
it's gonna go online, and publicity
would be, what, word of mouth?

1448
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:31,126
So I think what I'm wondering is...

1449
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:33,362
why do you get nine out
of ten of my dollars?

1450
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,682
Gretta, you're
a very smart young woman,

1451
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,609
and, uh, you're a determined artist,

1452
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,770
and you have a...you have
a wonderful project here.

1453
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:44,605
And with the right team behind you
to push you and guide you

1454
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:48,885
in the right direction and maybe hire
a producer to remix a couple tracks,

1455
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:52,203
you could have a hit record
and a very long career,

1456
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:56,729
but, you know, ultimately, that's...
that's up to you.

1457
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,247
Ah, you had them.
You wound him up.

1458
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:02,330
I know. It's amazing when
you're not actually that interested,

1459
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:03,527
you always win the hand.

1460
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:07,446
Yeah, that's never really
worked out that well for me.

1461
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,523
I mean, I found it worked very well.
Yeah.

1462
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:11,409
You're gonna get a deal.

1463
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:13,289
That asshole is gonna
give you a deal, babe.

1464
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:15,681
You might have to
compromise a little bit, but...

1465
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,808
Never.
Of course.

1466
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,764
Hey, we should do a bunch of these.

1467
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:22,247
What do you mean?
Could do, like, the, uh...

1468
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,084
"The European Series."

1469
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:27,164
I like that.
"Paris Tapes." "Prague Sessions."

1470
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:29,129
"The Berlin...Recordings."

1471
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:30,850
Yes.
Go all over Europe by rail.

1472
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,889
We could take the whole gang.
You know?

1473
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:36,123
Rachel, Malcolm, Steve.

1474
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:40,001
So...
So...

1475
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:45,644
LoOk, l guess
I'll see you in a while.

1476
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:48,001
Thank you.

1477
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:30,126
Thank you so much.

1478
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:33,766
Oh, man.

1479
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:35,809
Thank you.

1480
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:38,088
Guitar change. All right.
All right!

1481
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:42,086
Uh, so this next song
was actually given to me

1482
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:45,050
by an amazing songwriter
and an even more amazing woman.

1483
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:49,250
Uh, yeah. So it's a very special song...
we're gonna do her arrangement of it.

1484
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:52,927
So...If she's here,
I'm not sure that she is...

1485
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:55,606
uh, I'd love her to come up
and join us on this one.

1486
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,809
There's a guitar right there, so...
you know, if you're here, please...

1487
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,401
please join us. It's a really
special song to me, so...

1488
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:04,245
See your vision of this song through.

1489
01:37:16,853 --> 01:37:21,822
# please don’t see #

1490
01:37:21,989 --> 01:37:27,864
# just a boy caught up
in dreams and fantasy #

1491
01:37:27,976 --> 01:37:33,708
# please see me #

1492
01:37:33,843 --> 01:37:37,916
# reaching out for someone i can see #

1493
01:37:38,058 --> 01:37:44,734
# take my hand. #
# let’s see where we wake up tomorrow #

1494
01:37:44,864 --> 01:37:49,833
# best laid plans #
# sometimes i’m just a one night stand #

1495
01:37:49,975 --> 01:37:56,895
# i’ll be damned #
# cupid’s demanding back his arrows #

1496
01:37:56,996 --> 01:38:02,938
# let’s get drunk on our tears #

1497
01:38:03,088 --> 01:38:06,963
# and god, tell us the reason #

1498
01:38:07,047 --> 01:38:11,781
# youth is wasted on the young #

1499
01:38:11,822 --> 01:38:12,864
# it’s hunting season #

1500
01:38:12,906 --> 01:38:16,760
# and the lambs are on the run #

1501
01:38:16,802 --> 01:38:19,916
# searching for meaning #

1502
01:38:20,083 --> 01:38:26,779
# but are we all lost stars #

1503
01:38:26,812 --> 01:38:32,791
# trying to light up the dark #

1504
01:38:32,979 --> 01:38:37,833
# who are we #

1505
01:38:37,950 --> 01:38:42,833
# just a speck of dust within the galaxy #

1506
01:38:42,933 --> 01:38:49,520
# who is me #

1507
01:38:49,827 --> 01:38:54,858
# when our careful turns into reality #

1508
01:38:54,979 --> 01:38:58,854
# don’t you dare let our best

1509
01:38:58,937 --> 01:39:06,875
# yesterday i saw a lion kiss a deer #

1510
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:11,864
# maybe we’ll find a brand new ending #

1511
01:39:06,916 --> 01:39:07,916
# turn the page #

1512
01:39:12,050 --> 01:39:18,890
# where we’re dancing in our tears #

1513
01:39:18,991 --> 01:39:22,885

1514

01:39:26,903 --> 01:39:28,875
# it’s hunting season #

1516
01:39:28,916 --> 01:39:32,770

1517
01:39:32,812 --> 01:39:34,881

01:39:34,822 --> 01:39:41,906

1519
01:39:42,013 --> 01:39:46,979
# trying to light up the dark #

1520
01:39:48,802 --> 01:39:51,902
# and i thought i saw you out there crying #

1521
01:39:54,889 --> 01:40:00,058
# and i thought i heard you call my name #

1522
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,875
# and i thought i heard you out there crying #

1523
01:40:03,916 --> 01:40:07,833
# oh, just the same #

1524
01:40:12,833 --> 01:40:15,791
# god and give us the reason #

1525
01:40:15,833 --> 01:40:18,958
# youth is wasted on the young #

1526
01:40:19,050 --> 01:40:21,791
# it’s hunting season #

1527
01:40:21,833 --> 01:40:24,900
# and this lamb is on the run #

1528
01:40:25,018 --> 01:40:27,833
# searching for meaning #

1529
01:40:27,958 --> 01:40:33,875
# but are we all lost stars #

1530
01:40:33,916 --> 01:40:41,770
# just trying to light...light up this dark #

1531
01:40:41,958 --> 01:40:44,885
# and i thought i saw you out there crying #

1532
01:40:47,995 --> 01:40:50,822
# and i thought i heard you call my name #

1533
01:40:52,854 --> 01:40:56,791
# and i thought i heard you out there crying #

1534
01:40:56,833 --> 01:41:02,895
# oh, but are we all lost stars #

1535
01:41:02,981 --> 01:41:09,927
# trying to light up the dark #

1536
01:41:10,028 --> 01:41:14,937
# oh, but are we all lost stars #

1537
01:41:15,039 --> 01:41:23,525
# trying to light up the dark #

1538
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:50,489
Hey.
Hey.

1539
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:54,531
Where are you going?
Uh...home.

1540
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:59,964
What's on your mind?
Ok, um...

1541
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:02,805
I don't want your label
to release my album.

1542
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:04,761
Fine.

1543
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:06,922
Fine? Really?
Well...

1544
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:09,082
No, because I thought
that you'd be really upset.

1545
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:10,571
No. It's your album.

1546
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:13,690
So, what do you want
to do with it, then?

1547
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:14,841
There it is.
Yeah.

1548
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,604
That's the whole album for a dollar.

1549
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:18,524
A buck for a boOk.
The whole thing.

1550
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:20,967
Now, once this goes out, that's it.

1551
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:22,451
They're gone.
Yeah.

1552
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,329
Are you sure you want to do this?
Yeah.

1553
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,926
How about two bucks?
You're such a capitalist.

1554
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:30,527
No, a buck is fair, and then, you know,
we'll split it evenly between everyone

1555
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:32,648
and Malcolm and Rachel...
everyone. Come on.

1556
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:38,011
Once I press this, that's it.
I'm going to war with my whole business.

1557
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:39,491
Mm...

1558
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:47,884
Oh...!

1559
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:49,644
That's so exciting.

1560
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:51,928
Ok...
What are you doing?

1561
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:53,605
Calling reinforcements.

1562
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:57,404
Whoa.
What?

1563
01:42:57,560 --> 01:43:00,404
Check it out. I got Troublegum
to tweet out the album.

1564
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:02,403
How many followers
does he have?

1565
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:04,688
Apparently the entire world.

1566
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:07,366
Just about every living
human being follows him.

1567
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:11,210
Mr. Mulligan.

1568
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,089
Good morning.
Good morning.

1569
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:15,891
News for you on the lnterwebs.

1570
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:19,608
Shit.
You didn't know nothing about this?

1571
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,250
No. How many did she sell?
No?

1572
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:23,687
10,000. Today.

1573
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:26,804
Troublegum tweeted about it.
Man, if Troublegum helped her out,

1574
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,530
it's because he liked her, all right?

1575
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:30,848
They're artists.
They're great...

1576
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,083
You didn't know nothing about this?
Nothing. It's kind of funny, though.

1577
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:36,686
Is it really?
It's pretty funny, man.

1578
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:38,763
Booboo, you know how to pick 'em, boy.

1579
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:40,081
It's kind of good.
It's good.

1580
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:41,600
It is. It's kind of epic.
Yeah.

1581
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:43,125
Clean out your locker.

1582
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:45,531
See you later.
