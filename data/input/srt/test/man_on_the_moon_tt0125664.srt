1
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:47,833
Hello.

2
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:50,958
I am Andy...

3
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:54,750
and I would like to thank you
for coming to my movie.

4
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,542
I wish it was better,
you know,

5
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:03,958
but... it is so stupid.

6
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:08,208
It's terrible.
I-I do not even like it.

7
00:01:08,292 --> 00:01:10,875
All of the most important
things in my life...

8
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:13,958
a-a-are changed around
and mixed up...

9
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,958
for, um--

10
00:01:17,292 --> 00:01:19,917
uh, dramatic purposes.

11
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:24,250
So...

12
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,750
I decided to cut out...

13
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:29,250
all of the baloney.

14
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:34,917
Now the movie
is much shorter.

15
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,875
In fact,

16
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:43,875
this... is the end
of the movie.

17
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,042
Thank you very much.

18
00:01:57,792 --> 00:01:59,792
I am not fooling.

19
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:02,583
Good-bye.

20
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:04,583
Go.

21
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,958
Wow. You're still here.

22
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:06,417
O-kay!

23
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,417
I hope you're not upset.

24
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,042
I did that to get rid
of those folks who just...
wouldn't understand me...

25
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,583
and don't even want to try.

26
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:17,917
Actually, the movie
is really great.

27
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,875
It's just filled
with colorful characters,

28
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:24,667
like the one I just did
and the one I'm doing now.

29
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:26,667
Our story begins...

30
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:33,000
back in Great Neck,
Long Island.

31
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,458
This is our house.

32
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,917
And that's
my father's old car.

33
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,250
That's my father.

34
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,208
That's my little brother
Michael.

35
00:04:46,292 --> 00:04:48,750
That's my little sister
Carol.

36
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,292
- And that's my mom.
- Janice?

37
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:54,542
Andy's up in his room?

38
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:56,208
Yeah.

39
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:06,625
Mr. Bear is saying that Mrs. Cat
made his head fall off.

40
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,208
She saw it
And it's not true.

41
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:11,667
Today's special guest,
Mr. Bear.

42
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:14,583
- What's up, Mr. Bear?
- Andy?

43
00:05:20,792 --> 00:05:23,708
Son, this has got to stop.

44
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:27,042
Our house is not
a television station.

45
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,958
There's not a camera
in that wall.

46
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:33,083
I mean, this is not healthy.
You should be outside playing sports.

47
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,417
But I have
my own sports show.

48
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,417
Andy, you know that's
not what I meant.

49
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,333
Look, I'm gonna put my foot down.
No more playing alone.

50
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:46,042
- You want to perform, you
have got to have an audience.
- They're right there!

51
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,667
That is not an audience.
That is plaster.

52
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:53,917
An audience is made of people,
people who live and breathe.

53
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:05,875
Andy Kaufman
and Howdy Doody present...

54
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,583
"The Animal Song"!

55
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:11,750
I'm gonna say the animal,
and then you tell me what it says.

56
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,750
- Okay?
- Okay.

57
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:18,750
- Oh, the cow goes--
- Moo.

58
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:23,958
- And the cat goes--
- Meow! Meow!

59
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,542
And the bird goes--

60
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,792
- Tweet, tweet.
- Tweet, tweet!

61
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:33,917
And the lion goes--

62
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:37,042
Roar!

63
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,875
- And the dog goes
- Ruff.

64
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,917
- And the cat goes
- Meow.

65
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,792
- And the bird goes
- Tweet.

66
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:48,875
- And the pig goes
- Oink.

67
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,958
And that's the way
it goes

68
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:59,417
- The comedy stylings
of Andy Kaufman.
- Thank you.

69
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:03,875
So, Mr. Besserman,
same spot tomorrow?

70
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:07,583
I don't know, Andy.
I think I have to let you go.

71
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,125
You're firing me?

72
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,875
You-- You don't
even pay me.

73
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,708
I don't want to seem insulting,
but your act is like amateur hour.

74
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:24,625
You're doing sing alongs
for six-year-olds and puppets
that aren't funny.

75
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,375
- Playing records?
- But it's totally original.

76
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,208
No one's ever done it.
I'm not like everyone else.

77
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:34,083
Well, everybody else
gets this place cookin'.

78
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,542
I thought it was cooking.
There was a man over here
that was really upset.

79
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,792
He stormed out,
and a lot of other people left
in the middle of your act.

80
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:44,542
- I can't sell booze--
- It's not about comedy.
It's not about art.

81
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,625
- It's about booze.
- I can't sell booze when you're
singing "Pop Goes the Weasel."

82
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,083
- That's all that matters.
- I'm running a business here.

83
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:54,625
It's show business.
Show business. Show business.

84
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,708
Without the business,
there's no show.

85
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,792
- There's no show for you.
- Wh-What do you want me to do?

86
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:04,958
- "Take my wife, please"?
- At least it's a joke. Try some jokes.

87
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:08,458
Like, "Why did the Siamese twins
go to England?"

88
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,708
I don't know.
Why did they go to England?

89
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:13,917
So the other one
could drive.

90
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:18,875
But why doesn't the other one
just learn how to drive?

91
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:22,375
Whew. Maybe that one
isn't for you.

92
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,917
But do jokes about the traffic,
do impressions,

93
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,417
maybe some blue material.

94
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,792
Thank you very much.
Goodnight!

95
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:26,542
Now?

96
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,542
Now.

97
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,542
Thank you very much.

98
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,917
One thing I do not like...

99
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:40,542
is too much traffic.

100
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,792
You know?

101
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,500
Tonight
I had to come...

102
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,667
from... uh--

103
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:56,000
A-And the freeway,

104
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,417
it-it was so much traffic.

105
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:04,500
I-It took me an hour
and a half to get here.

106
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:09,417
But-- But...

107
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,208
talking about
the terrible things--

108
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,583
My wife-- take my wife.
Please take her.

109
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,375
Ugh.

110
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,833
No.

111
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,125
No. I am only fooling.

112
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,292
I-- I-I love my wife,

113
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:34,750
but she don't know
how to cook.

114
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,375
Her cooking is so bad.

115
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,958
- It's terrible.
- No.

116
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,000
Now I-I would like to--

117
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,292
I would like
to do for you...

118
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:48,292
the imitations.

119
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:51,250
I would like to start...

120
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,917
with the--
the Jimmy Carter.

121
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:57,917
The president
of the United States.

122
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,750
Hello, I am Jimmy Carter,

123
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:09,250
the president of the United States.

124
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,750
God!

125
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,958
Thank you very much.

126
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,583
And now I would like
to do for you...

127
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,917
the--

128
00:11:30,042 --> 00:11:31,917
the Elvis Presley.

129
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,917
Well, it's one for the money
two for the show
three to get ready

130
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,750
Now go, cat, go
Now, don't you

131
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,875
Step on my blue
suede shoes

132
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,542
Well, you can do anything
but lay off of
my blue suede shoes

133
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,125
Let's go, cat!

134
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,583
Budd, what's the story
with this guy?

135
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,583
I think he's
from Lithuania.

136
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,750
Oh, blue, blue
blue suede shoes

137
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,958
Baby, blue, blue
blue suede shoes, honey

138
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,750
Blue, blue
blue suede shoes, baby

139
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,375
Blue, blue
blue suede shoes

140
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:26,417
You can do anything
but lay off of
my blue suede shoes

141
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:28,417
Oh, well
we were dancin'

142
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:31,625
We were dancin'

143
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:37,750
To the jailhouse rock

144
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,375
All right!

145
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,875
Whoo!

146
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,708
Thank you very much.

147
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:09,042
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.

148
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:12,750
I didn't mean to startle you.
I really liked what you did out there.

149
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,125
Thank you very much.

150
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:20,292
So I understand
you're from Lithuania.

151
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:23,542
No, I am from Caspiar.

152
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,625
Caspiar, huh?

153
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,583
It is a very small island
in the Caspian Sea.

154
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:35,583
It sunk.

155
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,083
Oh, I'm sorry. Uh--

156
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:41,583
Look, uh, I'm probably
out of my mind,

157
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:43,958
but I think you're
very interesting,

158
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,542
and if you ever need representation,
we should talk.

159
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:49,583
Okay.

160
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,875
"George Shapiro."
Mr. Shapiro.

161
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,417
Wow.

162
00:14:58,542 --> 00:15:02,208
- It is an honor, sir.
- Caspiar, huh?

163
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:05,250
I wanna be the biggest star
in the world.

164
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,417
Well, people
love comedians.

165
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,667
I'm not a comedian.
I don't do jokes.

166
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:14,083
I don't even know what's funny.
I'm a song-and-dance man.

167
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:16,083
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you.

168
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,583
Uh, I particularly suggest
the lotus root.

169
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:33,167
Um, but y-y-you, uh,

170
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:35,208
you know, you show
a lot of promise.

171
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:39,375
And my concern is
I don't know where to book you.

172
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,083
You're not a stand-up,
and, uh,

173
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:46,750
your act doesn't exactly
translate itself to film, so--

174
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:53,750
Um--

175
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,833
So help me.
Where do you see yourself?

176
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,083
Well, I've always wanted
to play Carnegie Hall.

177
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,542
That's funny.

178
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,083
See, I don't want to go
for cheap laughs.

179
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:12,917
I want real gut reactions.

180
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,917
I want the audience
to have gone through an experience.

181
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,625
They love me, they hate me,
they walk out. It's all great.

182
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,792
- Andy, you got a little something--
- Hmm?

183
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,417
Oh.

184
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,708
When I'm famous,
I'm gonna sell these,

185
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:33,917
as worn by Andy Kaufman.

186
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:35,917
You can have this one.

187
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:40,083
It's probably gonna be worth a lot
'cause it was actually up my nose.

188
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,417
You're insane!

189
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:48,083
But you might also
be brilliant.

190
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,292
Hello.
George Shapiro here.

191
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:56,875
Uh... yeah!
Is this George Shapiro ?

192
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,250
- Yeah, speaking.
- Speaking!

193
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,167
Reeking, seeking, creaking.
Freaking!

194
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:05,208
Big freaking deal! Tell me something
I don't know, toadstool!

195
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:07,208
Can I help you
with something?

196
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:11,083
Yeah, you can stay away
from Andy Kaufman,
if you know what's good for you.

197
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,583
- Crankshaft!
- Who is this?

198
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,917
Do not twist my noodle,
toy poodle!

199
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,167
This is Tony Clifton,
a name to respect, a name to fear!

200
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:24,625
- Kaufman is a lying bastard.
He is a psychopath!

201
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,375
Now slowly open your eyes.

202
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:34,250
You should feel rested,
relaxed and alert.

203
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:39,542
Uh, I would like to thank you,
Your Holiness.

204
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:44,417
My heart is radiating
pure energy.

205
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,375
- Okay--
- Oh, no. Wait.

206
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,500
Wait. Uh-- I'm sorry.

207
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,375
Uh, I have a question.

208
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,958
Is there--

209
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,458
Is there a secret
to being funny?

210
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,625
Yes.

211
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,625
Silence.

212
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:10,792
Upbeat]

213
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:13,792
Upbeat]

214
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,625
Welcome back
to Saturday Night Live.

215
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,125
And now, as a special treat
on our first show,

216
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,958
musical guest
Andy Kaufman!

217
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,875
What's wrong
with this guy?

218
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:09,583
This is dead air.

219
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:22,250
Band]

220
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:26,458
Mr. Trouble never
hangs around

221
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:30,708
When he hears
this mighty sound

222
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,875
- Here I come
to save the day

223
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,042
That means that Mighty Mouse
is on his way

224
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:41,875
Yes, sir, when there is
a wrong to right

225
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:46,250
Mighty Mouse
will join the fight

226
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,458
On the sea
or on the land

227
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:53,833
He gets the situation
well in hand

228
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:57,042
So though we are in danger
we never despair

229
00:19:57,167 --> 00:20:00,583
'Cause we know that
where there's danger
he is there

230
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:03,417
- He is there
on the land, on the sea

231
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,875
In the air

232
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:09,792
- We're not worrying
at all

233
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,625
We're just listening
for his call

234
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:17,417
- Here I come
to save the day

235
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:21,208
That means that Mighty Mouse
is on the way

236
00:20:23,042 --> 00:20:25,417
- Mr. Kaufman?
- Hmm? Oh.

237
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,417
Hi. Right this way,
please.

238
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,042
- Okay.
- George is expecting you.

239
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,708
Hey, Andy.

240
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,417
Hey.

241
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:38,042
- Thanks for coming out.
- Oh, thank you, George.

242
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:40,500
- Come on, sit down.
- Um, oh.

243
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:43,375
- Wow, they're-- Which one?
- Either one.

244
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:46,750
- They're both red.
- Yeah.

245
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,125
This one, I guess.

246
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,458
- So did you have a nice flight?
- I-I did.

247
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,542
I had a really good flight,
and the stewardess was very, very nice.

248
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,958
And she allowed me
to keep my headphones.

249
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:01,833
- Oh, that's terrific!
- Yep. Mm-hmm.

250
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,417
Andy,
I got something better.

251
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,542
- You do?
- Yeah.

252
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,375
This is big.

253
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,708
Okay.

254
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,708
- Okay?
- Okay.

255
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:15,000
You are getting
a once-in-a-lifetime,

256
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,500
very lucrative
opportunity...

257
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:21,750
to star on a prime time
network sitcom!

258
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:30,250
- A sitcom?
- Yeah.

259
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,250
And this is a class act.

260
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:36,208
It all takes place
in a taxi stand.

261
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,333
And you're gonna be
the Fonzie.

262
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,750
I'm... Fonzie?

263
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,250
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no.

264
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,833
The Fonzie, the crazy,
breakout character...

265
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,042
who all the kids
imitate,

266
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:52,500
and they put him
on the lunch boxes.

267
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:55,458
- I hate sitcoms, George.
I've never liked them.
- Hold on.

268
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:59,000
- These guys have seen
your foreign man character.
- Yeah?

269
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,125
And they wanna
turn him...

270
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,083
into a lovable,
goofy mechanic...

271
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:07,083
named--

272
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:14,250
Latka.

273
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,458
- Uh, no.
- No?

274
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,458
- No.
- No to which part?

275
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:26,708
No to the whole thing.
It doesn't sound good to me.

276
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:31,208
- Andy, this is every
comedian's dream!
- I'm not a comedian.

277
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:34,750
A-And sitcoms are the lowest
form of entertainment.

278
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,083
I mean, it's just...

279
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,542
stupid jokes
and canned laughter!

280
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,875
And you don't know why
it's there, but it's there.

281
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:45,625
It's dead people laughing.
Did you know that?
Those people are dead!

282
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,875
This is--
This is classy.

283
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:49,917
I-I don't care.

284
00:22:50,042 --> 00:22:53,917
I-I wanna generate
my-my own material.

285
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,375
Look, I-listen.
Listen to me.

286
00:22:57,458 --> 00:23:00,250
Look, I've been in this business
for 20 years!

287
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:03,083
I know. I've seen this!
I know this.

288
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:06,167
If you pass up
this opportunity,

289
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:11,417
you will never, never see
another one like it again.

290
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:13,417
Never!

291
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,875
Yeah.

292
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:27,375
- Okay. I'll do it.
- Ah.

293
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:30,083
- But I have some terms.
- Oh, sure.

294
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:33,208
That's-- That's what
negotiations are all about.

295
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:40,792
- What are you doing?
- I'm writing out my terms.

296
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:53,417
Wh-- What, are you
making fun of me?

297
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,917
- Those are my terms.
- Th-This is ridiculous.

298
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,417
It's what I need.
It's what I need to do the show.

299
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,250
Wh-What is this?
It says, "Four guaranteed
guest spots for Tony Clifton."

300
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:06,292
- Who's Tony Clifton?
- He's a Vegas lounge singer.

301
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:08,875
And, um, I used to do
impressions of him,

302
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:11,292
and we sort of got
into a fight over it.

303
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:13,750
- This Clifton called me.
- He did?

304
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:16,458
- He's a loon! He hates you.
- No, no, no.

305
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:19,125
He just talks tough,
but I owe him.

306
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,958
And if I'm the new Fonz,

307
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:26,625
then ABC is just gonna have to...
give me what I want!

308
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,625
Hey!

309
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,500
Mr. Kaufman will only appear
in half the episodes of Taxi.

310
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:39,417
Mr. Kaufman requires
an undisturbed 90 minutes
of meditation prior to filming.

311
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:44,750
Uh, Mr. Kaufman gets
his own network special.

312
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:48,125
And, uh, Taxi
must guarantee...

313
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,458
four guest appearances
for Tony Clifton.

314
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:54,750
Who? Who?

315
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:57,292
Tony Clifton.

316
00:24:57,417 --> 00:24:59,542
Who the hell
is Tony Clifton?

317
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,542
Uh--

318
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,125
I don't know.

319
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:05,333
And now--

320
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:08,375
And now--

321
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,958
now Mama Rivoli's
is proud to present...

322
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:13,750
an international
singing sensation!

323
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:18,083
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Tony Clifton!

324
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:20,083
Ha!

325
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:28,083
Come on.

326
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:36,958
All right, all right!

327
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:40,708
Ladies and gentlemen,
uh,

328
00:25:40,792 --> 00:25:43,708
due to Mr. Clifton's
vocal constraints,
out of respect for him,

329
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,708
he asks that
if you please extinguish...

330
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:48,792
your smoking material,
your cigars and cigarettes.

331
00:25:48,917 --> 00:25:51,792
Goddamn! I paid ten bucks
for that cigar!

332
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,458
Uh, I'm sorry.

333
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:56,250
- Is he joking?
- And now,

334
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:59,250
ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Entertainment,

335
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:02,375
Tony Clifton!

336
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:16,583
What does
he think he's doing?

337
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,542
Vo...

338
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:30,375
...lare, whoa

339
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:35,917
Ca-wa-wa-wa-wa-wantare
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

340
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:40,542
No wonder
my happy heart sings

341
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:43,417
Your love
has given me wings

342
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,917
I got the wings
of a dove

343
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,500
I got the wings

344
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:52,042
I got the chicken wings
from Kentucky Fried--

345
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,542
Whoop-de-doo,
whoop-de-di!

346
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:03,875
Stick a-a needle
in your eye!

347
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:05,917
- Oh, my God.
- Let's get somethin'
straight, people.

348
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,917
I play big showrooms
in Vegas.

349
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,542
I need this place like I need
a shotgun blast to the face!

350
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:14,125
Now, let's go do wn andmeet
some ofthe audience.

351
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,250
All right.

352
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:19,583
How are you all doin'?
Where you from? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

353
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:22,083
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

354
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:25,708
Whoa! Somebody's wearin'
a lot of perfume around here!

355
00:27:25,792 --> 00:27:30,292
- Must be that time
of the month, huh?

356
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:33,500
Yeah, I know all the tricks.
How are you doin'?

357
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:36,417
You havin' a-- You enjoyin' that
pasta carbonara?

358
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:39,167
It appears that you are.

359
00:27:39,292 --> 00:27:42,500
Whoops! Hey, look out!
I think you sat in some cottage cheese.

360
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:46,042
Oh, pardon me. That's your ass.

361
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:48,917
Aww!

362
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:55,500
How you doin'?
You enjoyin' the show?

363
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:57,500
- Yeah.
- Huh?

364
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,708
- Yeah.
- What's your name?

365
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:01,750
Bob.

366
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:04,167
Bob! Bo-o-ob!

367
00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:08,583
Bo-o-ob! Bo-o-ob!

368
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:12,708
- What's your last name?
Up and down in the water?
- Ugh.

369
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:15,167
Huh?

370
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:17,292
Gorsky.

371
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:20,792
- Gorsky? That Polish?
- Yeah.

372
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:22,750
You tryin' to do
some Polish humor?

373
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:24,750
- No, that's, uh--
- Shut up!

374
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,875
- That's just my name.
- Shut up!

375
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:29,292
I do not appreciate,
uh, racial slurs!

376
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:31,750
I think them dumb Polacks
been ridiculed enough.

377
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,875
I do a clean show here.

378
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,417
You wanna see some humor?
Here's some humor right here.

379
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,250
Right there, okay?
Awww!

380
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:42,458
Sit down and enjoy that, okay?

381
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:45,208
And you-- Shapiro!

382
00:28:45,292 --> 00:28:48,375
I'll see you backstage, baldy.

383
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:51,708
Vo...

384
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:54,250
...lare

385
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,917
What do you want?

386
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:15,875
Just a little friendly conversation,
George.

387
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:17,917
You hungry?

388
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,917
You look thin!

389
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:24,375
Y-You-You--

390
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:29,208
Italiano, cacciatore
scallopini, pasta fazool

391
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:33,875
I don't understand
this act.

392
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,250
It's good, old-fashioned
entertainment, George.
Everyone loves a villain.

393
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:41,542
- What about that poor schlub
you humiliated?
- Hey, man, excellent show.

394
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:44,917
- That was a great show.
- Yeah, good show for you. Um, George.

395
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,750
This is, uh, my writer
and old friend Bob Zmuda.

396
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:50,250
Hey, George.
How are you? I'm Bob.

397
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:52,750
- He's very creative.
- Yes.

398
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,625
- I am the brains
behind this operation.
- Dream on.

399
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:59,375
He once faked a lion escaping
from the Chicago Zoo.

400
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:02,083
This was fantastic,
George.

401
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:04,667
We got 40 actors
tearin' through the zoo,
they're all screamin'.

402
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:09,125
- Closed the place down.
- "There's a fuckin' lion, man! A lion!"

403
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,542
Your name's not Gorsky.

404
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:16,875
Don't believe everything
you hear, George.

405
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:19,083
This cannot leave
this room.

406
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:22,083
Do not write this down,
okay?

407
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,917
Tony Clifton
is Andy Kaufman.

408
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:28,958
And Andy Kaufman
is Tony Clifton.

409
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:32,917
They'll deny it up and down,
but believe me, it's true.

410
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,958
This is great business.

411
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:38,625
You get two Andy Kaufmans
for the price of one.

412
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:47,292
- Andy. Andy.
- What's up?

413
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:51,250
They said yes.
You're gettin' everything. Everything!

414
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:55,417
Bonus.

415
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,667
- Whatever you want.
- Bonus! Thank you very much.

416
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,792
- It was so good.
- I have to do Taxi, though, right?

417
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:03,250
- You gotta do Taxi.
- Okay.

418
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:22,750
Party time for Latka?

419
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:26,792
- Not until you take off
those overalls.
- This is a good party.

420
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:31,250
No, no, Latka!
Listen to me. Listen to me.

421
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:33,417
There's a drug
in those cookies.

422
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:36,542
No!

423
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:39,625
No. No!

424
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:48,250
Bed?

425
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:51,375
I have never been so emotional...

426
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:53,375
in all my life.

427
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:55,792
And this is for my mother,
and this is for my father!

428
00:31:55,917 --> 00:31:58,708
And this is for
my grand father!

429
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:02,792
I hope you have
a small family.

430
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:17,458
- Ohh!
- Whee-ooh!

431
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:20,208
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

432
00:32:20,292 --> 00:32:22,750
Thank you very much!

433
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:32,750
- I'm gonna quit.
- What?

434
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:35,083
Every show is worse
than the last one.

435
00:32:35,167 --> 00:32:38,333
Forty million people
are watching your ass
every week, Kaufman.

436
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:41,958
- What do they know?
- Absolutely nothing!
And that's the beauty.

437
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:44,167
Man, look,
it's credibility.

438
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,917
You make them love you now,
and then later on,

439
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,750
on your special,
you can fuck with their heads.

440
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:52,583
The sky is the limit, man.

441
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,542
Oh, yeah?
I don't care!

442
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,833
Sir, there 's a problem
down on the Kaufman special.

443
00:33:02,917 --> 00:33:07,375
- They say he's not following
the technical requirements.
- Technical?

444
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,458
Thanks for coming
on my show.

445
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:11,750
Thanks for having me
on your show, Andy.

446
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:14,083
- Right now, roll it!
- No.

447
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:18,042
It's my special!
I have creative control. Now roll it!

448
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:20,542
- No!
- Do it, man!

449
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:23,875
- Hey, Andy! Hi.
- Be careful, please.

450
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:26,458
Only positive energy allowed
beyond this point.

451
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:29,917
I've been hearing fabulous things
about the special.

452
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:32,250
What, did we hit
a little speed bump?

453
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:35,042
Mm-hmm,
and his name is Colin.

454
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:37,583
Kid Genius told me to mess
with the vertical hold.

455
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:40,083
- Show me.
- Show him.

456
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:42,083
Show him, Colin.

457
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:48,083
Thanks for having me
on your show, Andy.

458
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:50,083
Boy, it sure--

459
00:33:56,583 --> 00:34:00,542
It'll be great. People will think
their TV is broken.

460
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:03,167
They'll get out of their chairs,
walk over to the TV,

461
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,625
twist the knobs,
call the TV store.

462
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,625
"I paid a lot of money
for that TV!"

463
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,083
They'll bang on the television,
but they won't be able to fix it!

464
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:16,292
Andy. Andy.

465
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:19,583
We don't want the viewers
to get out of their chairs.

466
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:22,417
But it's funny.

467
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:25,250
It's a practical joke.

468
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:29,583
The viewer must be able
to see the program.

469
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:35,417
But-- But it's only
gonna be for 30 seconds.

470
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:38,875
- Five.
- Twenty.

471
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:41,375
Ten.

472
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:42,708
Deal.

473
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:48,292
- Okay, Andy. Ten seconds, huh?
- Ten seconds, okay.

474
00:34:48,417 --> 00:34:50,292
- Okay.
- Okay.

475
00:34:58,083 --> 00:35:00,750
- Ten seconds is all
I really wanted.
- Ten seconds is perfect.

476
00:35:05,042 --> 00:35:07,750
You know, Howdy, I've been watching you
since I was a little boy.

477
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:09,750
I didn't even know
what television was.

478
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:13,417
Oh, look at how cute he is, huh?
Isn't this great?

479
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:17,292
- That is so moving.
- You're as real
as anyone else on the show.

480
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:20,583
And I love you.
I really do.

481
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:22,708
This is not funny.

482
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:25,958
This is artsy-fartsy shit.
I mean, what--

483
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:29,375
This is the magical part of the show.
The show's not all like this.

484
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:31,958
It's hysterical.
It gets very funny.

485
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:35,917
For Christ's sakes,
we're the number one network.
Can't we afford a decent TV?

486
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,917
No, no, no, th-that's
part of the show.

487
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,917
- This is part of the show?
- Yes.

488
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,917
What do you mean,
it's part of the show?

489
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,458
Th-That's the way Andy wants it,
with the rolling.

490
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:49,708
Thanks, Andy.
I love you too.

491
00:35:51,792 --> 00:35:56,250
Tell Kaufman this network
will never air this program.

492
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:59,375
Hey, that's
Andy Kaufman.

493
00:35:59,417 --> 00:36:01,500
Do you wanna bet?

494
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:04,167
Hey. Hey.

495
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,917
Hey, excuse me.
Are you Andy Kaufman?

496
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,792
I get that all the time.

497
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,708
Andy.

498
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:23,125
This is ridiculous.

499
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,125
Take off that apron.

500
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:30,750
No. I'd rather work here
than at ABC.

501
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:34,083
- Ah, I'm sorry.
They're a bunch of assholes.
- Yeah.

502
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:38,208
We work in a creative business.
There's no telling what people
are gonna like or dislike.

503
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:41,375
The only reason why I did Taxi--
the only reason--

504
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,750
was so that I could
have my own special.

505
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:45,958
I know.
I'll tell you what.

506
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:48,042
Let me book you
some colleges now,

507
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:50,250
and then I'll take
the special around.

508
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:53,708
I'll show it to people
and see if anybody wants to buy it.

509
00:36:53,792 --> 00:36:56,583
We'll have a garage sale.
No, I'm over and out.

510
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:59,708
- You know, you're not over and out.
- I am over and out.

511
00:36:59,792 --> 00:37:01,750
- You can't be over and out.
- I'll show you over and out.

512
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:04,375
You've got a deal with ABC.
You've gotta honor it.

513
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:08,000
All right. How much longer's left
on my contract?

514
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:10,917
You signed for five years,
so...

515
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,875
four years and seven months.

516
00:37:36,917 --> 00:37:38,833
Thank you.

517
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:40,833
It's really great
to be here.

518
00:37:40,917 --> 00:37:43,792
We're gonna have
a great show tonight.

519
00:37:43,917 --> 00:37:46,125
Really good one!

520
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,833
We're gonna-- We're gonna start
by singing some songs.

521
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:53,042
- Do Latka!
- Yeah, Latka!

522
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:55,000
Come on, Latka!

523
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:01,875
Latka! Latka! Latka!

524
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:05,583
- Latka! Latka!
- Excuse me for one second.

525
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,917
- I saw that.
- What?

526
00:38:10,042 --> 00:38:12,583
- Give me the book.
- What book? No, I'm not
going to give you the book.

527
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:14,833
- Is something wrong?
- No, everything's okay. Fine.

528
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,250
- Can I squeeze your nuts? Thanks.
- Ohh!

529
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:20,958
They're askin' for it.

530
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:31,208
Ladies and gentlemen,
since you're such a...

531
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:33,250
special audience--

532
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:35,917
Yeah!

533
00:38:36,042 --> 00:38:39,042
I'm going to reveal
for the very first time,

534
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:41,750
ever, the real me.

535
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:43,750
That's right.

536
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:51,625
Ahem.
I'm actually British.

537
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:56,958
And though I dabble in clowning,
I do find it so boorish,

538
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:59,042
so... American.

539
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,458
I prefer the fine arts,
henceforth, today...

540
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:06,167
I am going to grace you
with a reading...

541
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,583
of one of the greatest
novels ever written,

542
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:11,042
The Great Gatsby
by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

543
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:17,833
Please.

544
00:39:19,292 --> 00:39:21,917
"In my younger
and more vulnerable years,

545
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,917
my father gave me some advice
that I've been turning over
in my mind ever since.

546
00:39:26,042 --> 00:39:28,542
'Whenever you feel
like criticizing anyone,'
he told me,

547
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,708
- Latka!
- 'just remember that all
the people of this world...

548
00:39:30,792 --> 00:39:32,875
- Latka!
- haven't had the advantages
that you've had.'

549
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:36,708
But he'd always been unusually
communicative in a reserved way,

550
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:39,042
and I understood
that he meant...

551
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:41,917
a great deal more than that."

552
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,417
Thank you very much.

553
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,417
Yeah!

554
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:58,875
"In consequence,

555
00:39:58,958 --> 00:40:00,917
I'm inclined
to reserve all judgments,

556
00:40:01,042 --> 00:40:03,875
- a habit that has opened up
many curious natures to me...

557
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:06,542
and also made me the victim
of not a few veteran bores."

558
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:09,375
- Oh, come on!
- No, no. No, no.

559
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:12,792
No, no, please keep it down.
We've got a long way to go.

560
00:40:12,917 --> 00:40:15,042
"They were the same people,

561
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:18,750
or at least the same sort of people,
the same profusion of--"

562
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,750
I tell you what.

563
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:24,458
Would you rather I kept reading,
or do you prefer to hear
the phonograph record?

564
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:26,417
Record!

565
00:40:26,542 --> 00:40:28,792
- I'm sorry. I can't hear you.
- Record!

566
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:31,958
- Are you positive?
- Yeah!

567
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:35,208
- Very well then.
- Yeah, "Mighty Mouse"!

568
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:44,375
"His presence gave the evening
it's quality of oppressiveness.

569
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:49,625
It stands out in my memory
from Gatsby's other parties
that summer."

570
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:52,708
The green light,
the orgiastic future...

571
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:55,583
that year by year recedes before us.

572
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,542
Tomorrow--

573
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:06,542
Tomorrow
we will run faster,

574
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:09,833
stretch our arms out
further,

575
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:12,625
and one fine morning,

576
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:16,542
so we beat on,
boats against the current,

577
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:20,708
borne back ceaselessly...

578
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,708
into the past."

579
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:27,750
The end.

580
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:31,542
All right!

581
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,583
You wanna play Arizona State?

582
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:58,917
You give 'em Mighty Mouse.
You give 'em Elvis.

583
00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:01,542
- I-I gave them The Great Gatsby.
- Yes.

584
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:04,125
- F. Scott Fitzgerald's best work.
- A classic.

585
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:08,292
- His finest piece of work.
- I don't care.

586
00:42:12,917 --> 00:42:14,833
Andy.

587
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:19,250
Andy, you have to look inside
and ask this question.

588
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:21,792
Who are you trying
to entertain?

589
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:24,250
The audience
or yourself?

590
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:29,375
Excuse me.

591
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:31,750
Ah.

592
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:34,083
- Bob. Bob, I'm-I'm--
- What, George?

593
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:36,583
I'm worried about Andy.

594
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:39,875
This is not good. His stress level
is affecting his work.

595
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Calm down, George.
That's not gonna help anything.

596
00:42:43,167 --> 00:42:45,625
Look, uh,

597
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:48,625
Tony Clifton is gonna go on Taxi
next week.

598
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:52,583
That should, uh,
let him blow off steam
and relieve the stress.

599
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:54,583
- Bob, Bob, Bob.
- Okay?

600
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:57,333
Andy needs to relax.
This is your job.

601
00:42:57,417 --> 00:43:00,875
- You have to take him away
from all of this.
- My job.

602
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:06,500
- Would you come on?
- Okay.

603
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,917
Sh--

604
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,625
- Hi. How are you doin' today?
- Fine.

605
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:14,250
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

606
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:17,375
- How are you?
- Peachy.

607
00:43:17,417 --> 00:43:19,833
Oh.

608
00:43:19,917 --> 00:43:21,917
Yeah

609
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:33,542
- What do-- What do we do now?
- Now you pick.

610
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:39,083
But what if I...
hurt somebody's feelings?

611
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:42,417
For Christ's sake, you're not
gonna hurt anybody's feelings.

612
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:45,000
They're-- They're all professionals.
All right?

613
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:47,083
Okay.

614
00:43:53,042 --> 00:43:55,167
All right.
Which one?

615
00:43:56,958 --> 00:43:59,333
I will have both!

616
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:08,583
I will have this fraulein
und the one with the big strudels.

617
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:11,167
Mach schnell,
mach schnell!

618
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:14,125
Oh, no. Zmuda,
I'm gonna kill you.

619
00:44:14,208 --> 00:44:16,250
Excellent choice.

620
00:44:17,417 --> 00:44:19,333
- Hi.
- Hi.

621
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:21,750
Are you having
a good day?

622
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:24,625
It's kind of a big day.

623
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:27,125
It's my buddy's first time
with a prostitute.

624
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:31,083
What are you talkin' about?
Andy comes here almost every weekend.

625
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:33,583
Who, Andy?

626
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:36,500
Oh, he doesn't always
call himself that.

627
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:39,125
Sometimes he's Tony,
and he wears a tux.

628
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:42,750
- Yeah
- Oh, ho!

629
00:44:58,417 --> 00:45:00,375
Hey, um,

630
00:45:02,542 --> 00:45:06,375
if-- if I gave you both...

631
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:08,333
three hundred dollars,

632
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:10,375
would you, um,

633
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:16,458
come to Hollywood and help me
destroy a TV show?

634
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:21,583
Five hundred.

635
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:31,083
What am I, Harry Houdini, huh?

636
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:34,542
Oh, we busted through.
Come on, girls.

637
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:36,708
Welcome to
the Follies "Bree-gere."

638
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:40,083
- Okay, here's the man. Tony Clifton.
- Taxi, laxy.

639
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:42,208
- Just the factsy, Maxie.
- Hi.

640
00:45:42,292 --> 00:45:44,750
Hey, hot shot.
How you doin'?

641
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:48,375
- Ed Weinberger.
- Take a hike! Okay, all right, huh?

642
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,292
All right.

643
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,708
- What are we doin', huh?
- Here's your script, uh, Tony.

644
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:54,833
- That's the script I was given?
- Yeah.

645
00:45:54,917 --> 00:45:57,542
That's the one I have to do?
Okay, let me see.

646
00:45:57,625 --> 00:46:00,583
Okay, bullshit, bullshit,
my line.

647
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:02,875
Bullshit, bullshit,
my line.

648
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:04,708
Ohh! Ha-ha!

649
00:46:04,792 --> 00:46:07,750
That's hilarious!
That is hilarious!

650
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:11,458
I reviewed that script last night
and I was not satisfied.

651
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:14,542
- Yeah, well--
- I was not satisfied.

652
00:46:14,667 --> 00:46:16,833
- Why don't we--
- So I made a few changes.

653
00:46:16,917 --> 00:46:19,875
I stayed up all night
with these sweet ladies right here.

654
00:46:19,958 --> 00:46:22,792
This is Lemonade.

655
00:46:22,917 --> 00:46:25,458
- That'll keep you going
on a hot day.
- Can we get to work?

656
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:29,042
And this is Melonia.
How's my little produce department?

657
00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:32,417
Honk, honk, honk,
honk, honk.

658
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,458
This is the new Taxi
theme song.

659
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:43,208
Oh, yes
we drive a taxi

660
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:48,417
Aaaah!

661
00:46:48,542 --> 00:46:53,250
Aaaah!

662
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:55,458
Aah-aah-aah-aah-ahh!

663
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:57,458
George.

664
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,625
Now, I can't afford
to blow this whole episode, so...

665
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,750
we have to let him go.

666
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,292
I'm not sure how Andy's
gonna take this.

667
00:47:09,417 --> 00:47:13,042
We'll just have to
go down and tell him.

668
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:15,958
But-But that's Tony down there.
It's not Andy.

669
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,750
I don't give a fuck who that is.
I'm gonna fire him.

670
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:20,875
Okay. All right.

671
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,375
But we better
warn Andy first.

672
00:47:23,458 --> 00:47:26,292
He's up in San Francisco
doin' a concert.

673
00:47:26,417 --> 00:47:29,250
I'll call my secretary.

674
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:33,417
Diane, this is George.

675
00:47:33,542 --> 00:47:37,583
- I'm trying to reach Andy
up in San Francisco.
- Okay.

676
00:47:37,708 --> 00:47:41,375
- I'll patch you through.
- I'll wait.

677
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,250
- Hello.
- Andy, I'm gonna put you
on the speaker.

678
00:47:47,792 --> 00:47:49,750
- Hello, Andy. Hi.
- Hello ?

679
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:52,125
- I'm here with Ed over at Taxi.
- Hi, Ed.

680
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:54,125
- Hi, Andy.
- How are you?

681
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,708
- I'm fine.
- Good.

682
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:58,583
- Andy, there's been
some trouble with Tony.
- Oh, no.

683
00:47:58,708 --> 00:48:00,833
Did-- Did he get hurt?

684
00:48:00,917 --> 00:48:03,750
- No.
- Andy, it's nothing like-- No.

685
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:06,750
- Did he hurt someone else?
- No, no. It's not that.

686
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:09,375
Andy, uh, the reason
I'm calling you like this...

687
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,042
is I have the utmost respect
for your artistry.

688
00:48:13,167 --> 00:48:16,708
Well, may I say that I've
always appreciated that, Ed.

689
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:20,792
Thank you, but you see,
in this instance, um,

690
00:48:20,917 --> 00:48:24,375
I have to ask your
permission to fire Tony.

691
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:30,458
Oh, my.

692
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:34,167
George, this
is gonna kill Tony.

693
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:37,583
- He's waited for this his whole life.
- There'll be other shots.

694
00:48:37,667 --> 00:48:40,583
Yeah, we have to do this.
He's just a terrible actor.

695
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:45,708
Okay, but please,
let him down gently.

696
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:47,750
Trust us.

697
00:48:47,875 --> 00:48:50,958
Fuck you!
I'm not goin'!

698
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:54,250
We had a deal.

699
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:56,792
I don't know who you talked to.
I didn't talk to anybody.

700
00:48:56,917 --> 00:49:00,042
- You must have talked to someone else!
- I was talkin' to Andy Kaufman!

701
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:02,583
- I don't know no Andy Kaufman!
- Okay.

702
00:49:02,667 --> 00:49:06,333
Security, get in here!

703
00:49:06,417 --> 00:49:08,333
Security!

704
00:49:12,542 --> 00:49:15,208
Aah.

705
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:24,958
Don't hurt him!

706
00:49:25,083 --> 00:49:28,708
- He's a talented man!
- I don't want any pictures
leaving this set.

707
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:32,292
Hey, give me that! This is Zmuda!
He's one of 'em!

708
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:36,417
- You guys ever go to Vegas,
- Yeah, yeah.

709
00:49:36,542 --> 00:49:38,542
you're not gettin' in!

710
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:41,708
Hey, come back!
Give me the camera! Come here!

711
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:43,708
- Give me the camera!
- What?

712
00:49:43,792 --> 00:49:46,417
I got 20 bucks says
you work for me now!

713
00:49:46,542 --> 00:49:49,250
I would like
to use the phone!

714
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:52,875
- Not on the lot, sir.
- How 'bout a bathroom?
I may have shit my pants.

715
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:57,375
- Drink of water? Aspirin?
- Nope.

716
00:49:57,458 --> 00:49:59,583
- Moist towelette?
- No.

717
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:04,417
In that case, it has been an honor.
"Good-bee"!

718
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,417
This is great!

719
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,583
This is too much, man.

720
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:12,208
It makes Tony real,
gives him three dimensions.

721
00:50:14,208 --> 00:50:17,292
It's good for his career,
George.

722
00:50:17,417 --> 00:50:21,750
Oh, really? You wanna book Tony Clifton
at Harrah's Tahoe.

723
00:50:21,833 --> 00:50:24,083
I know the college kids
really like Andy Kaufman.

724
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:27,958
No, no, no. L-Look, Gene,
let me be really clear about this.

725
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:31,583
If you book Tony,
do not expect to get Andy.

726
00:50:31,708 --> 00:50:34,708
Yeah, yeah, well,
I'll take my chances, all right?

727
00:50:37,042 --> 00:50:39,958
All right.
Be my guest. Book him.

728
00:50:43,167 --> 00:50:44,750
Shut up!

729
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:49,458
Shut the hell up,
all of ya!

730
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:53,375
You make one more sound,
I'll come down there and put
your frickin' head in the soup!

731
00:50:53,458 --> 00:50:55,583
Whew.

732
00:50:55,708 --> 00:50:59,583
When I go like this,
it means I-I expect total silence!

733
00:51:00,917 --> 00:51:03,875
There is an artiste
on stage.

734
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:21,042
That's better.

735
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,542
Oh, whether I'm right

736
00:51:31,625 --> 00:51:33,625
Or whether I'm wrong

737
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:38,250
Oh, whether I find
a place in this world

738
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:41,458
Or never belong

739
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:44,708
I've got to be me

740
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:48,583
I've gotta be me

741
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:54,083
Willing to try
to do it or die

742
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:58,875
Yaah! Hah!
Aah!

743
00:52:00,667 --> 00:52:03,292
What?

744
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:07,083
Thank you very much!

745
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:11,375
Thank you.
I do all my own stunts.

746
00:52:12,667 --> 00:52:15,083
I've got to be

747
00:52:15,167 --> 00:52:17,375
Eeee

748
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:21,125
Eeee-eee

749
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:25,375
What the hell's
goin' on?

750
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:30,583
Kaufman?

751
00:52:36,792 --> 00:52:38,792
Kaufman's crappin'
on my act!

752
00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:46,875
Where's it say Kaufman's
in the act?

753
00:52:53,167 --> 00:52:56,875
- May I borrow this for a second?
- Oh, no.

754
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,750
No!

755
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:17,958
Ah, now you are
all wet, huh?

756
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:20,708
You look like you could use
a little drink up there.

757
00:53:21,875 --> 00:53:23,750
Why don't you go on,
get out of here!

758
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:26,875
Why don't you just
take off, Kaufman!

759
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,750
Get out of here,
little drummer boy!

760
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:30,583
Stay!

761
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,792
- I've got to be
- Don't leave, Andy! Come back!

762
00:53:33,917 --> 00:53:36,292
Eeee

763
00:53:36,417 --> 00:53:40,750
- Go home!
- Volare

764
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:43,042
Whoa-oh

765
00:53:43,167 --> 00:53:46,083
Ca-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa
wantare

766
00:53:46,167 --> 00:53:47,917
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

767
00:53:48,042 --> 00:53:50,208
Uhh! Ah!

768
00:53:57,250 --> 00:54:00,708
Jesus Christ.
Close the goddamn door. Close it!

769
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:04,250
Oh. Look at you.

770
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:07,000
You're so proud.

771
00:54:07,083 --> 00:54:10,000
You're like some stupid kid
who comes home from school--

772
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:12,000
"Look, Dad,
I got an 'F.'"

773
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,250
But wasn't it funny?

774
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:17,750
"Yes, it was funny, Andy.
It was."

775
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,917
Yes, it was funny
for a little while,

776
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,750
until the audience realized
that Tony wasn't you.

777
00:54:25,875 --> 00:54:28,583
Oh. Mmm.
Ohhh!

778
00:54:30,208 --> 00:54:32,083
So what do you have here?

779
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:35,500
A big, elaborate joke that's only funny
to two people in the universe--

780
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:37,583
you and you.

781
00:54:37,667 --> 00:54:41,083
Yeah, sure, George, yeah,
and we happen to think
that it's hilarious.

782
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:46,333
But what's the point?
What is the point?

783
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:48,333
It's fun, George!

784
00:54:50,208 --> 00:54:53,083
How is this gonna make you
the biggest star in the world?

785
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:58,083
George...

786
00:54:58,167 --> 00:55:02,375
at this point the audience
expects me to completely
shock them all the time.

787
00:55:02,458 --> 00:55:05,625
But short of faking my own death
or setting the theater on fire,

788
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:07,625
I don't know
what else to do.

789
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:10,625
'Cause I've always gotta be
one step ahead of them.

790
00:55:10,917 --> 00:55:13,417
Whoa-ohh!

791
00:55:13,542 --> 00:55:16,833
It's like ballet. Whoa!

792
00:55:16,917 --> 00:55:18,750
Did you see that?

793
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:20,583
Bam!

794
00:55:20,667 --> 00:55:22,708
...dropped to the canvas--

795
00:55:22,833 --> 00:55:26,667
These guys are brilliant.
I wanna be a bad guy wrestler
in the worst way.

796
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:30,750
I hate to break it to you,
but the problem here is
you don't have the build for it.

797
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:32,750
These guys are huge.

798
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:35,500
They would kick your ass.

799
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:43,042
Maybe I can pick on someone
a little smaller than me.

800
00:55:43,167 --> 00:55:47,250
No, no. Women are superior to men
in many ways.

801
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:49,625
That's right.

802
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:53,458
- When it comes to cooking,
cleaning, washing potatoes,

803
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:56,542
scrubbing the carrots,
making the babies,

804
00:55:56,667 --> 00:55:58,250
mopping the floors,

805
00:55:58,375 --> 00:56:00,375
they have it
all over men.

806
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,417
But when it comes
to wrestling--

807
00:56:02,542 --> 00:56:04,250
Shut up!

808
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:07,750
Be quiet
when a man is talking!

809
00:56:10,042 --> 00:56:14,083
If there is a woman here tonight
who can come up here
and prove me wrong,

810
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:17,625
I will shut my mouth
and pay her $500.

811
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:20,458
I can do it!

812
00:56:20,583 --> 00:56:22,250
Right here!

813
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:24,583
First come,
first served!

814
00:56:24,667 --> 00:56:27,083
Come on!
You wanna take me?

815
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:28,917
Come on up here.

816
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,917
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Lynne.

817
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,583
Lynne. We got Lynne
as a volunteer.

818
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:35,917
- Lynne, sweetheart, pay attention.
- You're pathetic!

819
00:56:36,042 --> 00:56:37,917
We'll see about that,
Suzy Q

820
00:56:38,042 --> 00:56:40,917
I want no kicking, biting,
scratching, head butts.
Do you understand?

821
00:56:41,042 --> 00:56:43,750
- Why? He's gonna play fair?
- lam not concerned with him.

822
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:46,750
- He is a professional.
- It's up to you to pin me.

823
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:49,750
- Yes, I understand.
- Very good.
Could we please shake hands.

824
00:56:50,833 --> 00:56:52,583
Oooh!

825
00:56:52,708 --> 00:56:55,708
Come out wrestling
when you hear the bell.

826
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:04,208
You see?
You see this?

827
00:57:09,417 --> 00:57:11,917
Yeah! Whoa!

828
00:57:14,083 --> 00:57:16,000
Hey, no choke holds!
I told you!

829
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:17,750
Yeah!
Come on!

830
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:21,250
Oww!

831
00:57:21,333 --> 00:57:23,750
I said, break it up,
Kaufman!

832
00:57:24,917 --> 00:57:26,833
- First warning!
- For what?

833
00:57:26,917 --> 00:57:30,333
You pulled her hair!
You won't be getting
a second warning!

834
00:57:30,417 --> 00:57:33,250
Shut up!

835
00:57:33,333 --> 00:57:35,375
I am the champion!
No woman can beat--

836
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,250
Ohh!

837
00:57:48,542 --> 00:57:50,458
- Ohh!
- Come on! Ohh!

838
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,833
One! Two!

839
00:57:54,917 --> 00:57:56,750
Three! That is it!

840
00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:59,750
It is over! It is over!
That is it!

841
00:57:59,875 --> 00:58:02,375
You are out!
You are down!

842
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:06,500
The winner and undisputed
intergender wrestling
champion of the world,

843
00:58:07,625 --> 00:58:10,208
Andy Kaufman!

844
00:58:10,292 --> 00:58:13,208
I am the winner!

845
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:16,083
I've got the brains!

846
00:58:28,083 --> 00:58:31,500
- Ma'am, here is your
complimentary photo of Merv.
- Thank you.

847
00:58:31,583 --> 00:58:34,000
- And your Turtle Wax.
- I don't want Turtle Wax.

848
00:58:34,083 --> 00:58:36,500
Every guest of Merv
takes Turtle Wax.

849
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:40,000
- And here is your gift voucher
to Red Lobster.
- Thank you so much.

850
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:44,000
Hey, hey, hey.
I just wanted to thank you
for doing such a great job.

851
00:58:44,083 --> 00:58:46,500
- I really appreciate it.
- Don't patronize me.

852
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:49,500
- Wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What?

853
00:58:49,583 --> 00:58:52,417
I hope you don't take
everything I did in there seriously.

854
00:58:52,542 --> 00:58:54,417
It's just
part of the show.

855
00:58:54,542 --> 00:58:57,417
It's like the old days
of the carnival barker...

856
00:58:57,542 --> 00:58:59,417
when he'd get the crowd
all riled up.

857
00:58:59,542 --> 00:59:02,417
So you just pretend
to be an asshole?

858
00:59:02,542 --> 00:59:04,417
That's what I'm good at.

859
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:08,417
Yeah, you are.

860
00:59:08,542 --> 00:59:11,917
You are really, really good at it.
You are.

861
00:59:18,917 --> 00:59:21,958
Merv Griffin got 2,000 pieces
of hate mail.

862
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:25,083
Don't make me laugh, George.

863
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:28,833
Andy, Merv does not
get hate mail.

864
00:59:28,917 --> 00:59:32,042
That means
we're a success.

865
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:33,417
Oh.

866
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:36,917
We got the room all worked up,
like punk rock.

867
00:59:37,042 --> 00:59:39,333
They detest you.

868
00:59:39,417 --> 00:59:42,833
The next time you make an appearance,
women are gonna picket.

869
00:59:42,917 --> 00:59:45,250
Do you think so?

870
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:49,500
Yes, because you have not given them
any clues that this is a parody.

871
00:59:49,583 --> 00:59:52,500
That's because I've only done it once.
They'll get used to it.

872
00:59:52,583 --> 00:59:55,000
Because I'm gonna do it
again and again...

873
00:59:55,083 --> 00:59:59,167
- and again and again
and again and again--

874
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:02,583
Oh, Rose Marie

875
01:00:02,667 --> 01:00:04,750
I love you

876
01:00:07,583 --> 01:00:10,292
I'm always dreaming

877
01:00:10,417 --> 01:00:13,375
Of you

878
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,542
No matter what I do

879
01:00:15,667 --> 01:00:16,792
- Aaah!
- No matter what I do

880
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:20,083
I can't forget you

881
01:00:21,667 --> 01:00:25,500
Sometimes
I wish that I'd

882
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:27,208
Never met you

883
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:34,083
And yet if I

884
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:36,333
Should lose you

885
01:00:36,417 --> 01:00:39,042
Time out!

886
01:00:39,167 --> 01:00:41,250
It would mean
my very life

887
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:43,250
- What's your problem?
- To me

888
01:00:43,375 --> 01:00:46,125
All right,
you are out of here!

889
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:49,333
Of all the queens
that ever lived

890
01:00:49,417 --> 01:00:53,542
I choose you

891
01:00:53,625 --> 01:00:56,208
To rule me

892
01:00:56,333 --> 01:01:00,625
- My Rose Marie
- Two adults, please. Thank you.

893
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:03,625
- You want some popcorn?
- Um, no, thank you.

894
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,625
I really want one.

895
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:09,583
Um, a large tub of popcorn, please.
Extra butter.

896
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:14,292
Why did you call me?
You are the last person
I expected to call me.

897
01:01:14,417 --> 01:01:17,583
Gosh, uh--
Gee, Lynne, I mean--

898
01:01:17,667 --> 01:01:20,583
I was just so impressed
with your wrestling moves.

899
01:01:20,667 --> 01:01:22,583
Yeah, you're impressed
with something.

900
01:01:22,667 --> 01:01:25,583
- You had a huge boner
on national television.
- Oh, man!

901
01:01:25,667 --> 01:01:27,583
- Yes, you did!
- Come on.

902
01:01:27,667 --> 01:01:29,917
I had it taped down
and everything.

903
01:01:30,042 --> 01:01:31,917
I hope
I didn't offend you.

904
01:01:32,042 --> 01:01:33,917
I'm here, aren't I?

905
01:01:34,042 --> 01:01:37,083
Hey, wanna go to Memphis
and get married?

906
01:01:39,667 --> 01:01:42,583
Do I wanna go to Memphis
and get married?

907
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:45,500
- Mm-hmm.
- Wh--

908
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:48,500
Why Memphis?

909
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:51,833
Because Memphis is the wrestling capital
of the world.

910
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:53,833
I'll get up in the ring...

911
01:01:53,917 --> 01:01:56,833
and I'll announce that I'll marry
the first woman who beats me.

912
01:01:56,917 --> 01:02:00,125
Then you can get up, we'll wrestle,
I'll let you win--

913
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:03,583
- You'll let me win?
- I'll let you win. I'll let you.

914
01:02:03,667 --> 01:02:07,917
Then we'll run off and get married
on the David Letterman show.

915
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,917
- God!
- Okay?

916
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:16,000
What do you say?

917
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:20,083
Is this for real?

918
01:02:20,167 --> 01:02:22,292
- Shut up!
- Boo!

919
01:02:22,417 --> 01:02:24,792
Shut up!

920
01:02:24,917 --> 01:02:29,125
I demand silence
when I am talking!

921
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:32,750
Total lack of respect
from Mr. Hollywood--

922
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:36,792
If there is one woman here tonight
who thinks she can defeat me,

923
01:02:36,917 --> 01:02:39,375
that lucky little lady...

924
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:42,292
will get to marry me!

925
01:02:42,417 --> 01:02:46,167
Let me ask you, folks--
What kind of man would
wrestle a woman anyway?

926
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:48,417
Kaufman!

927
01:02:49,875 --> 01:02:52,292
- Kaufman!
- Oooh.

928
01:02:52,417 --> 01:02:55,792
- Whoo!
- I'll take you on, you sissy.

929
01:02:55,917 --> 01:02:58,875
Whoa! The little lady is upset!

930
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,417
Well, let me tell you something,
baby.

931
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:05,083
Go back to the kitchen
where you belong before you get hurt.

932
01:03:05,208 --> 01:03:08,417
You get in the kitchen,
'cause I'm gonna make you do my dishes!

933
01:03:08,542 --> 01:03:11,917
Hey!
Stop it! Stop it!

934
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,250
This woman is a fake!

935
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:19,167
She's nothing more
than Andy Kaufman's girlfriend.

936
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:22,458
What?
Well, there you go.

937
01:03:22,583 --> 01:03:25,542
That's not true! That's not true!

938
01:03:25,667 --> 01:03:28,125
Faker!

939
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:31,583
- That is not true!
- Oh, yeah, that's true.
This is all a setup.

940
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:35,500
I'm not gonna allow you to make fools
out of all these people.

941
01:03:35,583 --> 01:03:37,958
Who the hell are you?

942
01:03:38,083 --> 01:03:41,250
I'm Jerry Lawler,
the king of Memphis wrestling!

943
01:03:41,375 --> 01:03:43,875
He's the King.

944
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:48,333
Hey, Kaufman,

945
01:03:48,417 --> 01:03:50,417
if you wanna
wrestle somebody,

946
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,333
I brought a real wrestler.

947
01:03:52,417 --> 01:03:54,917
She's trained,
and she's ready!

948
01:03:55,042 --> 01:03:57,750
Let's see if you can handle
Foxy Jackson!

949
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:00,083
Oh, my!

950
01:04:00,208 --> 01:04:05,083
Foxy Jackson and Andy Kaufman
right here, one-on-one!

951
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:08,958
I never agreed to this!
I will not do this!

952
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:12,333
Lawler, I did not agree to this.
This is against the rules!

953
01:04:12,417 --> 01:04:16,833
I don't think that Kaufman
is prepared for Foxy Jackson.

954
01:04:16,917 --> 01:04:19,792
- Kick his butt!
- Mr. Hollywood.

955
01:04:21,917 --> 01:04:25,292
Again, Kaufman showing
a total lack of respect.

956
01:04:25,417 --> 01:04:28,625
Foxy Jackson's gonna take Kaufman
to the woodshed, folks.

957
01:04:34,917 --> 01:04:38,125
Kaufman's hangin' on the ropes
like a little baby.

958
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:42,125
Foxy's about to take Kaufman
right out of his shorts!

959
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:05,417
- One, two--
- Can you believe it?

960
01:05:05,542 --> 01:05:07,583
- I got her!
- Get off of her!

961
01:05:07,708 --> 01:05:10,583
Get him off of her. Come on!

962
01:05:10,708 --> 01:05:12,333
Now there goes the King.

963
01:05:12,417 --> 01:05:16,583
Oh, the King just threw Kaufman down
like a rag doll!

964
01:05:16,708 --> 01:05:20,083
The King took matters
into his own hands!

965
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:22,083
What are you doing?

966
01:05:22,208 --> 01:05:24,083
I do not wrestle men!

967
01:05:24,208 --> 01:05:26,167
I am gonna sue you,
Lawler!

968
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:29,500
I am a national TV star,

969
01:05:29,583 --> 01:05:32,167
and I don't like
dumb, stupid crackers...

970
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:34,500
coming in the ring,
pushing me around!

971
01:05:34,583 --> 01:05:37,667
I did not agree to wrestle you!
I did not agree!

972
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:39,792
This is assault
and battery,

973
01:05:39,917 --> 01:05:42,958
and I'm gonna get a team of lawyers
to sue you...

974
01:05:43,083 --> 01:05:45,958
and your children
and your children's children.

975
01:05:46,083 --> 01:05:47,958
Let me tell you something,
Kaufman.

976
01:05:48,083 --> 01:05:50,417
Wrestling's
a very serious sport to me,

977
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:53,333
and I don't appreciate some jerk
like you trying to make fun of it.

978
01:05:53,417 --> 01:05:57,750
And I certainly don't appreciate
a jerk like you trying to make
fun of people from the South!

979
01:05:57,875 --> 01:05:59,750
So we can go to court,

980
01:05:59,875 --> 01:06:03,083
or you can get in the ring with a man
and wrestle for real!

981
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:05,167
Oh, you wanna
"rassle" me?

982
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:08,583
You wanna "rassle" me
Memphis style?

983
01:06:08,667 --> 01:06:12,583
Well, let me tell you something,
Mr. Lawler-- I am gonna
make you scream for mercy!

984
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:22,583
Come on, Kaufman!

985
01:06:24,583 --> 01:06:27,000
They didn't know
what hit them! Oh!

986
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:30,000
Is it an act?
Is it an act?

987
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:33,333
Or are you just addicted
to causing trouble?

988
01:06:33,417 --> 01:06:36,333
I can quit
anytime I want, baby!

989
01:06:36,417 --> 01:06:38,833
You know what?
I'm not a prop.

990
01:06:38,917 --> 01:06:41,833
Don't ever treat me
like that again.

991
01:06:41,917 --> 01:06:45,042
I'm sorry.
Hey. Hey.

992
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:48,917
Uh, I just get caught up,
that's all.

993
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:53,250
Sometimes I get lost.

994
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,667
Please, Andy,
enough with the wrestling.

995
01:07:03,083 --> 01:07:05,750
You don't think
I can beat him?

996
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:08,875
He's the Southern heavyweight champion.
He'll kill you.

997
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,917
I don't know.

998
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,625
I've wrestled women bigger than him,
and I've mopped the floor with them.

999
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:18,292
First you piss off women.
Then you piss off the South.

1000
01:07:18,417 --> 01:07:21,750
Then you get killed,
and I did the booking.

1001
01:07:22,917 --> 01:07:24,750
Funny.

1002
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:27,750
Listen, I got this job
that I want you to take.

1003
01:07:27,875 --> 01:07:30,250
It's guest-hosting
the TV show Fridays.

1004
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:33,250
It's not a great TV show,
but it'll be good for you.

1005
01:07:33,375 --> 01:07:36,458
It's live,
they'll give you carte blanche...

1006
01:07:36,583 --> 01:07:39,958
and you get back in the business
of making people laugh.

1007
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:44,625
- You said live?
- Live.

1008
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:46,625
I don't do drug humor.

1009
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:49,625
Andy, it's fine.
This is what the show is all about.

1010
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:51,583
Kids love this stuff.

1011
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:55,208
I don't do drugs,
and I don't enjoy making light of them.

1012
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:57,250
I was promised
creative control.

1013
01:07:57,333 --> 01:07:59,250
Nobody promised you
creative control.

1014
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:02,750
I got you the script
three days ago, and you haven't
said a damn word until today.

1015
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:05,417
We're going live in a few minutes.
It's too late.

1016
01:08:05,542 --> 01:08:07,417
Let's go!
Bring the audience in!

1017
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:10,417
- Live
from the Los Angeles Basin,
- Janice, it 's on!

1018
01:08:10,542 --> 01:08:12,417
it 's Fridays!

1019
01:08:12,542 --> 01:08:16,250
Andy Kaufman!

1020
01:08:17,792 --> 01:08:21,167
In this sketch,
two married couples
are out to dinner.

1021
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:24,667
Everybody has secretly
brought along a joint.

1022
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:30,667
Carl was the last one
to sneak to the bathroom
to get a little high,

1023
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:33,958
and now he's coming
back to the table.

1024
01:08:36,583 --> 01:08:39,458
Gee, restaurants are amazing,
aren't they?

1025
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:43,917
Strangers sitting around,
stuffing dead animals
into their faces.

1026
01:08:44,042 --> 01:08:46,792
It's incredible, isn't it?

1027
01:08:46,917 --> 01:08:49,083
Yeah, gee,

1028
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:51,208
and... the bathrooms...

1029
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:53,792
are... so...
colorful--

1030
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:10,667
Everything okay... Carl?

1031
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:14,417
I'm sorry.
I-- I just... can't do it.

1032
01:09:14,542 --> 01:09:17,292
I-- I can't play stoned.

1033
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:20,583
Read the cue cards.

1034
01:09:20,708 --> 01:09:22,583
I can't play stoned.

1035
01:09:22,708 --> 01:09:24,542
I-- I feel... stupid.

1036
01:09:24,625 --> 01:09:27,667
You feel stupid?
What about us?

1037
01:09:42,083 --> 01:09:44,000
I'm sorry.

1038
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:46,000
- I'm sorry.

1039
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:51,083
Andy.

1040
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:56,500
You didn't have to do that.

1041
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:01,625
Cut it out!

1042
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:04,417
Oh-- You jerk!

1043
01:10:04,542 --> 01:10:06,917
Okay, that's it.
Go to commercial now.

1044
01:10:07,042 --> 01:10:10,917
- I told you I didn't want
to do this sketch.
- Kaufman, get off my stage.

1045
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:15,583
Don't you touch me!
You're a nut!

1046
01:10:15,708 --> 01:10:17,250
- Break it up!
- A nut!

1047
01:10:17,375 --> 01:10:20,083
Settle down.

1048
01:10:20,208 --> 01:10:23,500
Oh, why does Andy do that?
Why? Why?

1049
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:25,708
I started using Suave--

1050
01:10:25,833 --> 01:10:27,750
We've gone
to commercial!

1051
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:30,333
- Excuse me!
- You're never
gonna work at ABC again!

1052
01:10:30,417 --> 01:10:34,458
Excuse me!
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

1053
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:38,125
You have all just participated
in a happening.

1054
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,792
Oh!

1055
01:10:46,583 --> 01:10:49,500
Now, okay, you know,

1056
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:54,000
to make it real, some of you
down there knew what was
going on and some of you didn't.

1057
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:57,208
But we don't want
to upset the folks at home,

1058
01:10:57,333 --> 01:11:02,583
so now Andy is going to tell them
that it was all just a prank.

1059
01:11:02,667 --> 01:11:06,625
Coming back
from commercial, and--

1060
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,917
During
the commercials,

1061
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,417
the people at ABC told me
to explain to you...

1062
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,375
that this whole fight episode
was staged.

1063
01:11:19,458 --> 01:11:21,833
- Oh, good.
- It's a lie!

1064
01:11:21,917 --> 01:11:23,833
It's a cover-up!

1065
01:11:23,917 --> 01:11:27,125
Why are you laughing?
I don't understand.
I'm not being funny now.

1066
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:29,125
What you saw was real!

1067
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:33,125
No, these-- these things happen
all the time at the networks,
only they cut away.

1068
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:35,375
- Cut to commercial.
- You see?

1069
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,917
You see?

1070
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,417
For sure they're gonna fire me,
so if you want to see me again
you'll have to come to Memphis--

1071
01:11:43,583 --> 01:11:45,333
- Ho ho ho
Green Giant
- What's in Memphis?

1072
01:11:45,375 --> 01:11:47,583
The Giant's flavor-tight pouch
Lets you--

1073
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:49,833
That kid is totally meshuga.

1074
01:11:56,833 --> 01:12:01,250
Jerry Lawler!

1075
01:12:06,583 --> 01:12:09,250
The most popular athlete...

1076
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:11,750
in the history
of Memphis, Tennessee,

1077
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:14,333
stepping inside
a squared circle.

1078
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:20,500
At 236 pounds,

1079
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:26,542
Jerry "The King" Lawler!

1080
01:12:30,542 --> 01:12:33,375
"March And Fanfare"]
- And introducing,

1081
01:12:33,542 --> 01:12:35,750
at 191 pounds,

1082
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:42,375
the holder of the world
intergender championship,

1083
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:47,375
here is Andy Kaufman!

1084
01:12:47,458 --> 01:12:51,083
You can hear
the ovation, or lack of one,
for Andy Kaufman.

1085
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:54,208
The cheers turned to jeers.

1086
01:12:54,375 --> 01:12:58,250
Lawler is gonna settle a score
for each and every one of us,

1087
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:03,250
because we've all been insulted
by this hideous Andy Kaufman
from Hollywood, California.

1088
01:13:03,333 --> 01:13:05,708
The referee
assigned to this bout--

1089
01:13:10,042 --> 01:13:11,875
Before we begin this event,

1090
01:13:12,042 --> 01:13:16,000
I just want to say a couple of things
to you disgusting people!

1091
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:20,667
Oh, come on.
That's just not right.

1092
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:23,000
Are you listening to me?

1093
01:13:24,917 --> 01:13:27,250
Okay!

1094
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:29,917
Ladies and gentlemen,

1095
01:13:30,042 --> 01:13:33,958
this is a bar of soap.

1096
01:13:34,083 --> 01:13:36,583
Say it with me.

1097
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:38,333
"Soap."

1098
01:13:38,417 --> 01:13:42,250
All you have to do is
wet this bar of soap...

1099
01:13:42,333 --> 01:13:44,417
and wipe your hands
with it...

1100
01:13:44,542 --> 01:13:46,417
and rub it on your body,

1101
01:13:46,542 --> 01:13:51,292
and soon that disgusting,
filthy dirt will come off!

1102
01:13:51,417 --> 01:13:53,792
Why is he
saying these things?

1103
01:13:53,917 --> 01:13:56,833
He's just engaging the audience.
He's riling them up.

1104
01:13:56,917 --> 01:13:58,792
They are going
to lynch him.

1105
01:13:58,917 --> 01:14:01,500
And now
for lesson two!

1106
01:14:01,583 --> 01:14:04,500
This is toilet paper!

1107
01:14:04,583 --> 01:14:06,500
Oh, good grief!

1108
01:14:06,583 --> 01:14:08,833
You just--

1109
01:14:08,917 --> 01:14:13,250
I'm gonna tell you
something, Kaufman--
we've had enough of your crap!

1110
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:17,042
Let's do what we came here to do.
Let's wrestle right now!

1111
01:14:17,167 --> 01:14:20,083
Well, here we go.
The King is ready.

1112
01:14:20,167 --> 01:14:23,083
And I hope, for Kaufman's sake,
he's ready.

1113
01:14:25,583 --> 01:14:27,667
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

1114
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:32,083
Kaufman's due a trip
to the old woodshed here.

1115
01:14:33,333 --> 01:14:37,000
Now, I never thought
I'd see the day that--

1116
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:39,292
Yeah, look at Kaufman.

1117
01:14:39,375 --> 01:14:42,292
Yeah, Kaufman doesn't
want any part of Lawler.

1118
01:14:42,417 --> 01:14:46,750
He's an absolute
embarrassment to humanity,
this man from Hollywood.

1119
01:14:46,917 --> 01:14:49,792
You see?
I am from Hollywood!

1120
01:14:49,875 --> 01:14:52,333
- Who cares?
- I have the brains!

1121
01:14:52,417 --> 01:14:54,333
Nobody cares where you're from!

1122
01:14:54,417 --> 01:14:56,417
I'm the king
I'm the king

1123
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,417
I'm the king
of Memphis, Tennessee

1124
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:01,583
Andy, please,
let's go home!

1125
01:15:01,708 --> 01:15:04,083
Don't worry, Mom.
I'll make you proud.

1126
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:06,625
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Uh-oh, Kaufman got nailed
with something.

1127
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:09,375
- Some fan threw something.
- Who did that?

1128
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,500
Who did that?

1129
01:15:11,583 --> 01:15:14,750
- You cannot touch me! I will sue you!
- Hey, Kaufman!

1130
01:15:14,875 --> 01:15:18,833
- I make more money in one day
than you do...
- Kaufman!

1131
01:15:18,917 --> 01:15:21,292
in your entire lives
combined!

1132
01:15:21,417 --> 01:15:23,542
Kaufman!

1133
01:15:23,667 --> 01:15:26,833
Did you come down here to wrestle
or act like an ass?

1134
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:32,333
Now get in the ring.
I'll give you a free headlock.
Okay? Come on!

1135
01:15:32,417 --> 01:15:35,958
Lawler seems to be willing to offer
a free hold of some kind.

1136
01:15:36,083 --> 01:15:38,042
No, no.
Drop it now, Andy!

1137
01:15:38,167 --> 01:15:40,083
It's okay!
It's okay!

1138
01:15:40,167 --> 01:15:43,583
Let Kaufman get in there,
and let's see what kind of man he is.

1139
01:15:43,667 --> 01:15:48,083
One, two, three--

1140
01:15:48,208 --> 01:15:52,583
- I can't believe that the King
is gonna go through with this.

1141
01:15:52,708 --> 01:15:56,833
That big-mouth son of a gun
has got a free headlock!

1142
01:15:56,917 --> 01:15:58,750
Business
may pick up here.

1143
01:15:58,875 --> 01:16:01,250
I did it!
This is for real!

1144
01:16:01,375 --> 01:16:04,250
Uh-oh.
Oh, look out, Kaufman!

1145
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:08,875
Oh, there he goes!
Oh, my!

1146
01:16:08,958 --> 01:16:11,417
Kaufman in trouble!

1147
01:16:12,958 --> 01:16:15,750
Look out! Look out!

1148
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:21,667
The King folded him up
like an accordion that time.

1149
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Now the King
is asking this crowd...

1150
01:16:25,083 --> 01:16:27,500
if they want to see
the pile driver.

1151
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:30,000
That's illegal.

1152
01:16:30,083 --> 01:16:32,333
Kaufman is out of it!

1153
01:16:32,417 --> 01:16:34,417
Oh, my!
Oh, my!

1154
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:37,417
It's gonna be a pile driver!

1155
01:16:38,917 --> 01:16:40,792
There it is!

1156
01:16:40,917 --> 01:16:42,917
Oh! Andy!

1157
01:16:43,042 --> 01:16:45,208
He's hurt bad.

1158
01:16:45,333 --> 01:16:49,750
- That's an automatic
disqualification right there.
- Lawler, you--

1159
01:16:49,833 --> 01:16:53,708
Well, Kaufman wins it,
but he doesn't look
like a winner right now.

1160
01:16:53,792 --> 01:16:56,750
- Come on!
- Keep it clear. Keep it clear.

1161
01:17:00,917 --> 01:17:02,792
- Hey, George.
- Hey, Lorne.

1162
01:17:02,917 --> 01:17:06,167
- Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.
- Oh, please.

1163
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,250
Right, I wanted to
talk to you about, uh,

1164
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:16,250
putting Andy back
on Saturday Night Live.

1165
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,417
I don't know whether Andy
works on the show anymore.

1166
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:26,917
- I mean,
the wrestling stuff is--
- Yeah, yeah.

1167
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:28,917
- Just, I think it's worn--
- The wres--

1168
01:17:29,042 --> 01:17:33,042
Yeah, we all agree, uh,
completely about the wrestling.

1169
01:17:33,167 --> 01:17:34,750
That's smart.

1170
01:17:34,875 --> 01:17:36,750
Yeah, uh--

1171
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:40,292
- Andy is very sincere.
- Right.

1172
01:17:40,417 --> 01:17:45,583
He's gonna apologize to
Jerry Lawler and repent for
all his bad guy shenanigans.

1173
01:17:45,708 --> 01:17:48,583
I apologize for all the wrestling
I've ever done.

1174
01:17:48,708 --> 01:17:52,000
I'm sorry for all the grief
I've ever given.

1175
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:57,000
I was just playing
bad guy wrestler, you know.
It's just a role. It's not me.

1176
01:17:57,083 --> 01:17:59,417
So, I guess Jerry
just, um,

1177
01:17:59,583 --> 01:18:02,208
um, took it personally.

1178
01:18:02,333 --> 01:18:06,583
Yeah, but, uh, I mean,
you said some pretty
inflammatory things.

1179
01:18:06,625 --> 01:18:09,958
Right. Everything's
a joke to this guy.
Just like that thing.

1180
01:18:10,083 --> 01:18:13,458
- I don't know if that's
a neck brace or a flea collar.
- That's not true.

1181
01:18:13,583 --> 01:18:16,208
This is serious.
I went to the hospital.

1182
01:18:16,333 --> 01:18:18,750
I was in the hospital
three days, in traction.

1183
01:18:18,833 --> 01:18:21,208
I'll tell you
something else.

1184
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:24,250
My father said I could've
hired a lawyer and sued you
for everything you've got.

1185
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:27,250
But I didn't because
I'm not that kind of guy.

1186
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:32,250
What kind of guy are you?

1187
01:18:43,417 --> 01:18:48,000
Tell you what-- I think maybe
I'll get a lawyer here.

1188
01:18:48,083 --> 01:18:50,917
If you were a man,
you'd apologize to me right now.

1189
01:18:51,042 --> 01:18:53,042
But you're just
poor white trash,

1190
01:18:53,167 --> 01:18:56,083
so I guess that's too lofty
a concept for you.

1191
01:18:56,167 --> 01:18:58,333
I mean,
what are you gonna do--

1192
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,458
Are we, uh-- Is everything--
Are you okay? Huh?

1193
01:19:11,583 --> 01:19:13,708
This-- I'm sick
of this shit, Lawler.

1194
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:17,375
I'm gonna sue you for everything
you've got, I swear to God.

1195
01:19:17,458 --> 01:19:20,708
Fuck you! Okay?
Okay, Lawler?

1196
01:19:20,833 --> 01:19:22,375
Fuck you!
I'm sorry, Dave.

1197
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:25,792
I know I'm not supposed
to say those things on television.

1198
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:28,958
I apologize.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1199
01:19:29,042 --> 01:19:33,000
But you, you are a
m-ing -hole!

1200
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:34,792
Okay?

1201
01:19:34,917 --> 01:19:38,125
Well--

1202
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:40,458
- Well--

1203
01:19:40,583 --> 01:19:42,458
I, uh--

1204
01:19:42,542 --> 01:19:47,167
I, I think you can use
some of those words on television,

1205
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:50,375
but what you can't do
is throw coffee.

1206
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:54,292
Some of us
at Saturday Night Live...

1207
01:19:54,417 --> 01:19:56,625
think Andy Kaufman's
a comic genius.

1208
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:58,625
But others disagree.

1209
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:01,125
They say he's
just not funny anymore.

1210
01:20:01,208 --> 01:20:04,125
So we're leaving
the decision up to you.

1211
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:08,125
To keep Andy,
call 1-900-555-7618.

1212
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:10,125
To dump him--

1213
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:16,833
This is bad.

1214
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:20,375
I, um, only got 28%.

1215
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:23,500
This is Saturday Night Live,
the hippest audience in television.

1216
01:20:23,583 --> 01:20:25,500
They turned on you.

1217
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,917
Look, it pains me
to say this,

1218
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,917
but I don't think you two guys should
ever work together again.

1219
01:20:36,375 --> 01:20:39,625
I'm sorry, George.
We just thought it was funny.

1220
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:42,125
You don't have to be sorry,
Jerry.

1221
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:44,333
You're-- You're terrific.

1222
01:20:44,417 --> 01:20:47,083
You're just the best.

1223
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:49,625
I wouldn't have traded it
for anything.

1224
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:52,083
To me, this was a shining
moment for wrestling.

1225
01:20:52,208 --> 01:20:54,583
Me too. And--

1226
01:20:54,708 --> 01:20:59,083
And it was a shining moment
for behavioral science.

1227
01:20:59,167 --> 01:21:02,667
Hey, well-- But why can't I make
a gag out of this?

1228
01:21:02,792 --> 01:21:06,833
I mean, maybe I could go on the show
and I could say...

1229
01:21:06,917 --> 01:21:10,375
it was rigged
and I demand a recount.

1230
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:15,375
Andy,
you don't understand.

1231
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:20,292
They don't
want you back.

1232
01:21:27,417 --> 01:21:29,458
Now close your eyes.

1233
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:35,083
If the thoughts of this world
come into your head,
don't be upset by them.

1234
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:38,292
It's just your stress
unraveling itself.

1235
01:21:38,417 --> 01:21:40,875
Just slowly
come back to the mantra.

1236
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,917
Andy?

1237
01:21:45,375 --> 01:21:47,250
Please?

1238
01:21:48,708 --> 01:21:51,667
Just continue your meditation.
I'll be back.

1239
01:21:52,917 --> 01:21:55,292
- Jai Guru Dev.
- Jai Guru Dev.

1240
01:21:56,667 --> 01:21:58,500
Hi, Andy.

1241
01:21:58,583 --> 01:22:00,417
Hi.

1242
01:22:00,542 --> 01:22:03,583
This is, uh,

1243
01:22:03,708 --> 01:22:07,083
very difficult
for me to say.

1244
01:22:07,208 --> 01:22:10,708
Uh, but we--

1245
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:13,375
we feel that it's best...

1246
01:22:13,458 --> 01:22:15,792
if you don't attend
the retreat.

1247
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:20,250
Why?

1248
01:22:21,375 --> 01:22:23,250
I go to the retreat
every year.

1249
01:22:23,375 --> 01:22:25,250
Oh, I know, Andy,

1250
01:22:25,375 --> 01:22:28,917
and we don't doubt your devotion
to Transcendental Meditation.

1251
01:22:29,042 --> 01:22:31,917
It's just that we feel that,
well, you and the program...

1252
01:22:32,042 --> 01:22:34,917
have, uh,
g-grown apart, uh--

1253
01:22:35,042 --> 01:22:36,917
Philosophically.

1254
01:22:37,042 --> 01:22:38,750
"Philosophically"?
What's "philosophically"?

1255
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:42,750
Well, Andy, the wrestling,
the sexist remarks, the foul language,

1256
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:45,792
they're just not becoming
of an individual
of spiritual enlightenment.

1257
01:22:45,875 --> 01:22:49,417
It seems you just
don't respect anything.

1258
01:22:50,708 --> 01:22:52,792
Of course I do.

1259
01:22:52,917 --> 01:22:55,875
I just-- I think of the world
as, as an illusion,

1260
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,917
and we shouldn't take ourselves
so seriously.

1261
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,417
Don't--

1262
01:23:01,458 --> 01:23:03,750
Don't,

1263
01:23:03,875 --> 01:23:05,708
please,

1264
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:08,042
do this.

1265
01:23:08,167 --> 01:23:11,458
You've got to let me
attend these classes.
It's what keeps me balanced.

1266
01:23:11,583 --> 01:23:13,750
I-It's apparently
not working.

1267
01:23:13,875 --> 01:23:17,458
Then, then help me.
Help me, okay? Guide me.

1268
01:23:17,583 --> 01:23:19,458
Andy...

1269
01:23:19,583 --> 01:23:22,792
we just don't wish
your presence here.

1270
01:23:31,083 --> 01:23:33,000
Hi.

1271
01:23:33,083 --> 01:23:35,667
I brought you
some Haagen-Dazs.

1272
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:39,667
I don't deserve
Haagen-Dazs.

1273
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:42,625
I'm-- I'm a badperson.

1274
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:44,625
Oh.

1275
01:23:48,542 --> 01:23:51,417
You aren't a bad person.

1276
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:54,583
You are
a complicated person.

1277
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:57,292
You don't know the real me.

1278
01:23:59,417 --> 01:24:01,333
There isn't a real you.

1279
01:24:03,917 --> 01:24:06,708
Oh, yeah.
I forgot.

1280
01:24:12,083 --> 01:24:13,958
Baby.

1281
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:19,583
Do you want to move in
with me?

1282
01:24:20,708 --> 01:24:22,625
What?

1283
01:24:22,708 --> 01:24:24,958
Say it again.

1284
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:32,708
Oh, Rose

1285
01:24:32,792 --> 01:24:34,708
Marie

1286
01:24:35,792 --> 01:24:37,625
I love you

1287
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:41,625
I'm always

1288
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:46,042
Dreaming of you

1289
01:24:57,792 --> 01:25:00,708
I'll get it.

1290
01:25:04,583 --> 01:25:08,583
Kaufman and Marguiles
Center for Sexual Research.

1291
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:10,583
Andy, it's George.

1292
01:25:10,708 --> 01:25:14,125
Hey, George. I'm not sure
we can do anything for you.

1293
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:18,708
Yeah. Uh, Andy, uh,
I got some crummy news.

1294
01:25:18,792 --> 01:25:20,708
Oh.

1295
01:25:20,792 --> 01:25:23,167
Taxi's been canceled.

1296
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:26,625
And the crummy news?

1297
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:31,875
Do you want me to come over,
we'll talk about it?

1298
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,417
Um, no.
I'm sorta busy right now.

1299
01:25:35,542 --> 01:25:37,375
I'll see you next week,
though.

1300
01:25:37,458 --> 01:25:39,375
Thanks.

1301
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:47,708
Put it right there.

1302
01:26:03,083 --> 01:26:04,958
Yuck.

1303
01:26:06,542 --> 01:26:10,458
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
a treat for staying late,

1304
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:15,875
please welcome, from Taxi,
the Improv's own Mr. Andy Kaufman!

1305
01:26:21,208 --> 01:26:23,500
Actually, Bud,
you're wrong.

1306
01:26:23,542 --> 01:26:27,125
I found out today that Taxi
has been canceled.

1307
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:28,792
What?

1308
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:32,625
Not to mention
that my wife left me,

1309
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,708
and she took the kids.

1310
01:26:38,083 --> 01:26:41,833
I don't understand why you're laughing.
I'm not joking.

1311
01:26:43,958 --> 01:26:47,667
And then this morning I got up
and I noticed that I have, um,

1312
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:49,875
a cyst
or some kind of boil...

1313
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,292
on the back of my neck.

1314
01:26:52,417 --> 01:26:54,750
Look.

1315
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:56,750
See?

1316
01:26:56,833 --> 01:27:02,583
So I was thinking, since I'm still
kind of a quasi-celebrity,

1317
01:27:02,667 --> 01:27:06,792
that maybe I could charge people
to touch it.

1318
01:27:08,917 --> 01:27:12,292
Would anybody like to pay
a dollar to touch my cyst?

1319
01:27:14,542 --> 01:27:18,083
I'm serious. I could really use
the money right now.

1320
01:27:18,208 --> 01:27:21,917
It 's a good deal.

1321
01:27:24,042 --> 01:27:25,958
Oh, okay.

1322
01:27:26,042 --> 01:27:28,917
Oh, wait, no.
You gotta pay first.

1323
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,875
It 's a dollar...

1324
01:27:32,958 --> 01:27:35,042
to touch my celebrity cyst.

1325
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:36,958
Okay.

1326
01:27:38,917 --> 01:27:41,833
Oww!

1327
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,458
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1328
01:28:00,583 --> 01:28:02,458
Thank you very much.

1329
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:09,167
W-Would Andy
like to tell us...

1330
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:12,417
why he called us out
at 4:00 in the morning?

1331
01:28:13,708 --> 01:28:15,792
Um...

1332
01:28:15,917 --> 01:28:17,792
yeah.

1333
01:28:17,917 --> 01:28:21,333
Uh, I have cancer.

1334
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,167
Forget it.
Forget it!

1335
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:30,042
- That is--
That is in terrible taste.

1336
01:28:30,125 --> 01:28:32,667
I don't wanna have anything
to do with this. Nothing.

1337
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:36,333
No, no, no, that's good.
We can make that play.

1338
01:28:39,042 --> 01:28:42,792
Okay, and we'll really--
We'll just drag it out. All right?

1339
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:46,250
Y- You get better,
you get worse.

1340
01:28:46,417 --> 01:28:50,833
No, you die, and then,
uh, you come back to life.

1341
01:28:50,917 --> 01:28:53,500
That's funny.

1342
01:28:53,542 --> 01:28:55,500
That's funny,

1343
01:28:55,583 --> 01:28:58,000
but, um,
it's not a gag, Bob.

1344
01:28:58,083 --> 01:29:01,000
I got cancer.
I got lung cancer.

1345
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:03,792
Lung cancer.

1346
01:29:03,917 --> 01:29:05,792
That's ridiculous.
You don't even smoke.

1347
01:29:05,917 --> 01:29:08,542
I've got some freaky
rare kind.

1348
01:29:08,625 --> 01:29:11,208
It's called
large-celled carcinoma.

1349
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:13,750
Yea!

1350
01:29:13,833 --> 01:29:15,750
I'm a lucky guy.

1351
01:29:28,917 --> 01:29:32,292
- Have you told your family?
- No. No.

1352
01:29:32,417 --> 01:29:34,375
I don't want to tell them.

1353
01:29:37,958 --> 01:29:39,875
I've just...

1354
01:29:44,167 --> 01:29:46,625
jerked them around so much.

1355
01:29:50,792 --> 01:29:54,292
Andy, look in my eye...

1356
01:29:54,417 --> 01:29:56,375
and tell me
this is true.

1357
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:00,000
I'm sorry.

1358
01:30:00,083 --> 01:30:02,583
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Hey.

1359
01:30:02,667 --> 01:30:04,583
I'm sorry.

1360
01:30:04,667 --> 01:30:08,458
Lynne? Come on.
Hey. Hey, hey.

1361
01:30:08,542 --> 01:30:10,958
Wait up.

1362
01:30:11,083 --> 01:30:14,292
If I find out that you're behind this,
I'll kill you, Zmuda!

1363
01:30:14,417 --> 01:30:17,250
What the hell are you
talkin' about, George?

1364
01:30:17,333 --> 01:30:20,208
I was the one who just said
I didn't believe him.

1365
01:30:20,292 --> 01:30:23,208
That's just the kind of thing
you two would work out to fuck me up.

1366
01:30:23,375 --> 01:30:25,208
Man]
We want the truth, boy!

1367
01:30:25,292 --> 01:30:28,417
My father said Lassie bit me,
so I said she did too.

1368
01:30:28,583 --> 01:30:32,208
- Lassie never
bit you, and you know it.
- Case dismissed!

1369
01:30:35,583 --> 01:30:38,458
Dramatic]

1370
01:30:53,958 --> 01:30:55,875
Dad?

1371
01:30:57,333 --> 01:30:59,333
The cancer started
in Andy's lungs...

1372
01:30:59,417 --> 01:31:01,542
and spread to his left arm.

1373
01:31:01,625 --> 01:31:04,708
We've initiated an aggressive
radiation program.

1374
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:08,167
- See if we can eradicate
the affected cells.
- Dr. Sullivan, line one.

1375
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:10,708
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

1376
01:31:16,167 --> 01:31:18,125
What a crock.

1377
01:31:20,417 --> 01:31:22,292
How dare you
make light of this?

1378
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:26,833
I cried when he broke his neck.
He's not getting me again.

1379
01:31:26,917 --> 01:31:28,958
Jesus Christ, Carol,
he's got lung cancer.

1380
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:31,333
He wants us
scratching our heads,

1381
01:31:31,417 --> 01:31:33,250
asking ourselves,
"Is this real?"

1382
01:31:33,333 --> 01:31:36,708
Of course it 's real.
We 're in a hospital.

1383
01:31:36,792 --> 01:31:39,750
Mom, it 's Cedars-Sinai.

1384
01:31:39,833 --> 01:31:41,750
It's a show biz hospital.

1385
01:31:41,833 --> 01:31:44,750
Andy's studio friends,
they probably run this place.

1386
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:48,750
He plans these things.
He takes over and hires actors.

1387
01:31:48,833 --> 01:31:52,250
Personally, I don't think
that doctor guy was very convincing.

1388
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:56,125
- His costume had the wrong shoes.
- Didn't even have doctor shoes.

1389
01:31:56,250 --> 01:31:59,208
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
That's bullshit.

1390
01:31:59,333 --> 01:32:02,000
No more Kaufman stories.
He's burned us too many times.

1391
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:05,917
A very reliable source
told me Andy Kaufman has lung cancer.

1392
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,708
Oh, please.
He's definitely not dying.

1393
01:32:08,792 --> 01:32:14,625
Now those big white cells
are attacking the cancer cells.

1394
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:16,875
Attacking.

1395
01:32:16,958 --> 01:32:18,875
Attacking.

1396
01:32:18,958 --> 01:32:21,375
I see them.
I see the white cells.

1397
01:32:21,458 --> 01:32:24,375
- Attacking.
- Attacking.

1398
01:32:24,458 --> 01:32:26,792
- Attacking.
- Attacking.

1399
01:32:40,625 --> 01:32:42,125
He's an actor.

1400
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:46,500
I-I recognize him
from The In-Laws.

1401
01:32:46,583 --> 01:32:48,708
Yeah. That's true.

1402
01:32:48,833 --> 01:32:51,750
But he's also ordained
in holistic medicine.

1403
01:32:52,958 --> 01:32:54,875
Oh.

1404
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,417
George, what am I
supposed to do?

1405
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:03,417
I'm sick and I'm trying to get better,
but everybody's looking at me funny.

1406
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:07,542
I feel like I'm being surrounded
by negative energy.

1407
01:33:14,792 --> 01:33:17,042
You're surrounded
by what you create.

1408
01:33:17,125 --> 01:33:20,833
- Great.
- Andy, you're the king
of negative energy.

1409
01:33:20,917 --> 01:33:23,417
- And it's gotta stop.
- Andy.

1410
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:25,917
'Cause if these
negative vibes get out,

1411
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,917
everybody's gonna be
talking about how sick I am,

1412
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,125
and it becomes
a self-fulfilling prophecy.

1413
01:33:32,250 --> 01:33:34,458
How can I help you?

1414
01:33:38,417 --> 01:33:40,292
I wanna go back to work.

1415
01:33:40,417 --> 01:33:43,625
- You wanna tour the clubs?
- No. No clubs.

1416
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:45,708
I wanna reach the top.

1417
01:33:48,792 --> 01:33:51,542
Carnegie Hall!

1418
01:33:51,625 --> 01:33:53,917
I want this show
to build and build.

1419
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I want it to be everything
that's joyful in the world
piled one on top of the other,

1420
01:33:58,083 --> 01:34:02,000
until the audience can't
stand it and they turn into
children right in front of me.

1421
01:34:02,083 --> 01:34:04,708
- I might even have Santa Claus.
- Oh, yeah.

1422
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:09,042
You can say, "Santa, what am I getting
for Christmas this year?"

1423
01:34:09,167 --> 01:34:11,625
- And he says "Cancer."
- No, that--

1424
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:14,625
No, that's-- I don't wanna do that.
That's a bummer.

1425
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:17,125
Uh, okay, positive, positive.
Okay--

1426
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:20,167
Look, this is really,
um, great--

1427
01:34:20,250 --> 01:34:22,167
- Santa and snow and--
- Yeah.

1428
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:24,375
But it's gonna cost
a fortune.

1429
01:34:24,458 --> 01:34:27,167
That's okay.
Not a problem.

1430
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:30,833
- Well, who's gonna pay for it, Andy?
- Tony Clifton.

1431
01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:34,083
Oh.

1432
01:34:34,208 --> 01:34:37,042
Andy, you know,
Tony doesn't have that kind of money.

1433
01:34:37,125 --> 01:34:39,042
Don't you worry about that,
George.

1434
01:34:39,125 --> 01:34:44,083
I know Tony better than you do,
and even if he has to work
another ten years to pay it off,

1435
01:34:44,167 --> 01:34:46,083
he'll do it.

1436
01:35:03,417 --> 01:35:07,042
Abu-dabi
Abi-dabu-ah

1437

Abu-dabi

1438
01:35:10,917 --> 01:35:13,208
Abi-dabi-dabu-eh

1439
01:35:13,292 --> 01:35:15,208
Abi-dabi-dabu-eh

1440
01:35:15,292 --> 01:35:17,833
- Abu-day
- Abu-day

ga-bohhhhhhhhhhhh

1445
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,958
Ohhhhhhhhhh

1446
01:35:34,083 --> 01:35:37,208
Abu-dabi
Abi-dabu-ah

1447
01:35:48,083 --> 01:35:52,542
I got spurs that
jingle-j angle-j ingle

1448
01:35:52,667 --> 01:35:57,042
As I go ridin'
merrily along

1449
01:35:57,125 --> 01:36:01,375
And they sing
Oh, ain't you glad
you're single

1450
01:36:01,458 --> 01:36:03,375
Ladies and gentlemen,

1451
01:36:03,458 --> 01:36:05,417
we are so very fortunate
tonight,

1452
01:36:05,542 --> 01:36:07,542
because we have with us...

1453
01:36:07,667 --> 01:36:11,583
the last surviving cowgirl
from that 1931 film.

1454
01:36:11,667 --> 01:36:14,000
She's 94 years young.

1455
01:36:14,083 --> 01:36:16,000
Eleanor Cody Gould.

1456
01:36:16,083 --> 01:36:19,542
- I got spurs that
jingle-jangle-jingle

1457
01:36:19,625 --> 01:36:22,875
As I go ridin'
merrily along

1458
01:36:24,542 --> 01:36:27,417
Hi, Eleanor.
It's great to have you here.
It's a real honor.

1459
01:36:27,542 --> 01:36:31,542
Thank you, Andy.
I'm delighted to be here.
It's overwhelming to me.

1460
01:36:31,625 --> 01:36:34,042
Well, it 's gonna
get even better,

1461
01:36:34,125 --> 01:36:38,875
because we found one of the old
original hobby horses from your movie.

1462
01:36:38,958 --> 01:36:43,375
Do you think you could grace us
with a couple of steps
from "Jingle, Jangle, Jingle"?

1463
01:36:43,458 --> 01:36:45,875
- Oh, I don't think--
- Okay, hit it!

1464
01:36:45,958 --> 01:36:48,542
"Jingle, Jangle, Jingle"]

1465
01:37:00,958 --> 01:37:02,875
Faster!
Come on!

1466
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:08,875
Faster! Faster!

1467
01:37:11,583 --> 01:37:13,708
Faster! Come on!

1468
01:37:26,958 --> 01:37:28,875
Faster! Faster!
Faster!

1469
01:37:34,792 --> 01:37:37,250
Faster!

1470
01:37:39,667 --> 01:37:41,208
Oh!

1471
01:37:41,333 --> 01:37:43,750
Andy, stop! Andy!

1472
01:37:46,333 --> 01:37:49,667
Is there a doctor in the house?
Stop the music!

1473
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:52,167
-- Uh, we need a doctor.

1474
01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:54,167
Anyone?
Please?

1475
01:38:02,583 --> 01:38:04,625
Can you call us
an ambulance?

1476
01:38:38,167 --> 01:38:41,000
Praise the Lord!

1477
01:38:44,083 --> 01:38:48,875
She's alive!
Hallelujah!

1478
01:38:48,958 --> 01:38:50,917
Hallelujah

1479
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,667
Hallelujah

1480
01:38:52,750 --> 01:38:55,750
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

1481
01:38:55,875 --> 01:38:57,500
Hallelujah

1482
01:38:57,583 --> 01:39:01,458
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Mormon Tabernacle Choir!

1483
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:07,708
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus

1484
01:39:07,792 --> 01:39:10,542
- Right down
Santa Claus lane
- Oh, my gosh!

1485
01:39:10,625 --> 01:39:13,083
- Vixen and Blitzen
and all his reindeer
- I can't believe this!

1486
01:39:13,208 --> 01:39:14,625
It's the Rockettes!

1487
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:17,458
Are pulling
on the reins

1488
01:39:17,583 --> 01:39:20,792
Bells are ringing
Children singing

1489
01:39:20,917 --> 01:39:25,167
All is merry and bright

1490
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:27,875
Hang your stocking
and say your prayers

1491
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,042
'Cause Santa Claus
comes tonight

1492
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,375
- Here comes Santa Claus
- Boys and girls,
you're not gonna believe this!

1493
01:39:36,458 --> 01:39:39,458
Here comes Santa Claus!

1494
01:39:39,583 --> 01:39:42,667
He's got a bag
that's filled with toys

1495
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:46,542
For the boys and girls
again

1496
01:39:46,625 --> 01:39:50,500
Hear those sleigh bells
jingle-jangle

1497
01:39:50,583 --> 01:39:54,500
What a beautiful sight

1498
01:39:54,583 --> 01:39:56,542
Jump in bed
Cover up your head

1499
01:39:56,625 --> 01:39:59,917
Since you've all been
such good boys and girls,

1500
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,792
I would like to take everybody
in this entire audience out...

1501
01:40:03,917 --> 01:40:06,542
for milk and cookies!

1502
01:40:06,667 --> 01:40:09,875
There are buses outside!
Everybody follow me!

1503
01:40:12,333 --> 01:40:15,750
Don't worry, folks!
There's enough milk and cookies
for everyone!

1504
01:40:15,833 --> 01:40:19,250
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1505
01:40:22,583 --> 01:40:24,458
Merry Christmas!

1506
01:40:55,417 --> 01:40:58,292
And now we'll place
the blue crystal.

1507
01:40:59,417 --> 01:41:01,292
Very high vibrations,

1508
01:41:01,417 --> 01:41:04,042
and it's wonderful,
wonderful...

1509
01:41:04,125 --> 01:41:07,333
for its
healing powers.

1510
01:41:07,417 --> 01:41:11,333
Okay.
Let's try two of those.

1511
01:41:11,417 --> 01:41:13,333
And another pink one.

1512
01:41:14,917 --> 01:41:16,542
All right.

1513
01:41:26,667 --> 01:41:28,792
Hah!

1514
01:41:28,917 --> 01:41:31,208
Looks like somethin'
my dog puked up.

1515
01:41:34,083 --> 01:41:37,167
How 'bout me and you dolls go out
and get some real food?

1516
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:39,167
Sure.

1517
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:41,875
French fries
and a porterhouse steak.

1518
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:47,042
Or we could skip the meal and go right
to the "montage a trois."

1519
01:41:51,333 --> 01:41:54,250
Have you ever been
with another woman?

1520
01:41:55,542 --> 01:41:58,208
Well, like, in the kitchen
and stuff, yeah.

1521
01:41:58,333 --> 01:42:00,958
Okay, hey, here.
This'll help.

1522
01:42:01,083 --> 01:42:02,958
Ah!

1523
01:42:03,083 --> 01:42:05,625
- Okay.
- Here. Put that on your face.

1524
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:07,625
- Yeah.
- There you go.

1525
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:11,625
- Hi.
- Now you can't
even tell the difference.

1526
01:42:14,750 --> 01:42:18,125
Well, we could put
all of this together in a soup.

1527
01:42:18,250 --> 01:42:21,125
Then we could pretend
it's a porterhouse steak, Andy.

1528
01:42:21,250 --> 01:42:23,125
I am not Andy.

1529
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:25,125
Andy is sick.

1530
01:42:25,250 --> 01:42:28,292
Chick, pick, wick, lick!

1531
01:42:28,417 --> 01:42:30,333
Dick!

1532
01:42:31,917 --> 01:42:34,875
Whereas I am getting
stronger and stronger.

1533
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:48,708
- Hi, Andy.
- Hey.

1534
01:42:48,833 --> 01:42:51,458
Hey.

1535
01:42:53,083 --> 01:42:54,958
You wanna wrestle?

1536
01:43:05,583 --> 01:43:08,292
Bob and I...

1537
01:43:08,417 --> 01:43:10,792
came up...

1538
01:43:14,667 --> 01:43:16,583
with a--

1539
01:43:16,667 --> 01:43:19,708
an idea for a TV show.

1540
01:43:22,583 --> 01:43:25,500
It'll be a Saturday morning
kind of thing...

1541
01:43:25,583 --> 01:43:28,000
where I can goof off
with the kids.

1542
01:43:29,417 --> 01:43:31,333
Yeah.

1543
01:43:32,667 --> 01:43:34,583
We can sell that, Andy.

1544
01:43:35,667 --> 01:43:37,583
Did your doctor say
it's okay...

1545
01:43:37,667 --> 01:43:39,875
to go back to work?

1546
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,458
No, but he will.

1547
01:43:43,583 --> 01:43:45,458
Yeah.

1548
01:43:45,583 --> 01:43:47,458
'Cause...

1549
01:43:47,583 --> 01:43:49,458
I'm going
to the Philippines.

1550
01:43:51,042 --> 01:43:54,708
The Philippines?
What's in the Philippines?

1551
01:43:57,583 --> 01:43:59,500
A miracle.

1552
01:46:54,083 --> 01:46:57,458
I just want to say,
until we meet again...

1553
01:46:58,750 --> 01:47:00,625
please remember--

1554
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:08,125
In this friendly
friendly world

1555
01:47:08,250 --> 01:47:13,792
With each day
so full of joy

1556
01:47:13,917 --> 01:47:18,042
Why should any heart

1557
01:47:18,167 --> 01:47:21,292
Be lonely

1558
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:27,583
In this friendly
friendly world

1559
01:47:27,708 --> 01:47:31,792
With each night
so full of dreams

1560
01:47:33,458 --> 01:47:36,833
Why should
any heart

1561
01:47:37,917 --> 01:47:40,250
Be afraid

1562
01:47:43,417 --> 01:47:46,292
Yep, it's a friendly world.

1563
01:47:46,417 --> 01:47:50,000
We should all treat each other
like brothers and sisters.

1564
01:47:50,083 --> 01:47:53,375
So everybody put your arm around
the person sitting next to you...

1565
01:47:53,458 --> 01:47:56,375
and sway back and forth
in rhythm to the music.

1566
01:47:56,458 --> 01:47:58,375
Come on. Everybody.

1567
01:47:58,458 --> 01:48:02,250
Even if you don't like
the person sitting next to you. Okay?

1568
01:48:05,458 --> 01:48:09,542
When I say "okay,"
you say "Okay!" Okay?

1569
01:48:09,667 --> 01:48:11,375
Okay.

1570
01:48:11,458 --> 01:48:14,375
- Okay.
- Okay.

1571
01:48:14,458 --> 01:48:16,875
- Okay.
- Okay.

1572
01:48:16,958 --> 01:48:18,875
Okay.

1573
01:48:18,958 --> 01:48:23,375
Everybody sing,
"The world is such a wonderful place."

1574
01:48:23,458 --> 01:48:28,542
- The world is such
a wonderful place

1575
01:48:28,667 --> 01:48:31,625
To wander through

1576
01:48:31,750 --> 01:48:32,875
Follow the bouncing ball.

1577
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,458
When you've got someone
you love

1578
01:48:36,583 --> 01:48:41,875
To wander along
with you

1579
01:48:41,958 --> 01:48:43,333
With the sky
so full of stars.

1580
01:48:43,417 --> 01:48:47,542
With the sky
so full of stars

1581
01:48:47,667 --> 01:48:52,375
And the river so full of song.
River so full of song

1582
01:48:53,542 --> 01:48:56,875
Every heart should be

1583
01:48:57,958 --> 01:49:00,958
So thankful

1584
01:49:01,083 --> 01:49:03,542
Thankful for this
friendly, friendly world.

1585
01:49:03,667 --> 01:49:08,208
Thankful for this
friendly, friendly

1586
01:49:08,333 --> 01:49:12,375
World

1587
01:49:15,417 --> 01:49:17,417
Thank you...

1588
01:49:17,542 --> 01:49:20,583
for this friendly,
friendly world.

1589
01:49:20,708 --> 01:49:22,583
Thank you...

1590
01:49:23,833 --> 01:49:25,750
and good-bye.

1591
01:49:37,208 --> 01:49:39,250
Andy! Ohh!

1592
01:49:46,250 --> 01:49:49,125
-- Andy!

1593
01:49:54,792 --> 01:49:57,208
Andy! Andy!

1594
01:49:57,292 --> 01:50:00,875
Andy? You guys
wanna see Andy tonight?

1595
01:50:02,833 --> 01:50:05,958
- Anybody got a flashlight
and a couple of shovels?

1596
01:50:06,083 --> 01:50:07,958
Okay, guys,
let's do our dirt!

1597
01:50:12,083 --> 01:50:14,542
First I was afraid

1598
01:50:14,625 --> 01:50:17,208
I was putrefied

1599
01:50:17,292 --> 01:50:19,375
Kept thinkin'
I could never live

1600
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:23,958
Without you by my side

1601
01:50:24,083 --> 01:50:26,958
But then I spent
so many nights

1602
01:50:27,083 --> 01:50:30,500
A-thinkin'
how you did me wrong

1603
01:50:30,625 --> 01:50:33,458
- And I grew strong
Mid-tempo Disco]

1604
01:50:33,583 --> 01:50:35,500
And I learned
to get along

1605
01:50:35,583 --> 01:50:37,167
And now I'm back

1606
01:50:37,250 --> 01:50:39,458
From outer space

1607
01:50:39,583 --> 01:50:41,500
I just walked in
to find you here

1608
01:50:41,583 --> 01:50:43,583
With that sad look
upon your face

1609
01:50:43,667 --> 01:50:45,542
I should've changed
that stupid lock

1610
01:50:45,625 --> 01:50:47,667
I should've asked you
for the key

1611
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:49,500
If I'd have known
for just one second

1612
01:50:49,583 --> 01:50:51,458
You'd be back
to bother me

1613
01:50:51,583 --> 01:50:54,417
Go on now, go
Walk out the door

1614
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:57,708
Don't turn around now

1615
01:50:57,833 --> 01:51:01,042
You're not welcome
anymore

1616
01:51:01,125 --> 01:51:03,708
Weren't you the one
that tried to hurt me
with "good-bye"

1617
01:51:03,833 --> 01:51:05,875
Did you think I'd crumble

1618
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,042
Did you think
I'd lay down and die

1619
01:51:08,125 --> 01:51:12,208
Oh, no, not I
I will "sur-vivvy"

1620
01:51:12,333 --> 01:51:14,458
As long as I know
how to love

1621
01:51:14,583 --> 01:51:16,208
I know
I'll stay "aleeve"

1622
01:51:16,292 --> 01:51:20,958
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love
to give

1623
01:51:21,083 --> 01:51:22,292
I will "sur-veev"

1624
01:51:22,417 --> 01:51:24,125
I will "sur-veev"

1625
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:26,333
I will "sur- veev"

1626
01:51:26,417 --> 01:51:28,292
I

1627
01:51:28,417 --> 01:51:29,750
Will

1628
01:51:29,875 --> 01:51:38,542
"Sur-veev"

1629
01:51:38,625 --> 01:51:41,083
I will survive! I will survive!
I will survive!

1630
01:51:41,167 --> 01:51:42,708
I will survive!
I will survive!

1631
01:51:42,792 --> 01:51:47,042
I will survive!

1632

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1640
01:52:31,792 --> 01:52:36,042
Now, Andy, did you hear
about this one

1641
01:52:36,167 --> 01:52:39,875
Tell me, are you locked
in the punch

1642
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,667
Hey, Andy
are you goofing on Elvis

1643
01:52:42,750 --> 01:52:44,667
Hey, baby

1644
01:52:44,750 --> 01:52:47,167
Are we losing touch

1645
01:52:48,375 --> 01:52:50,458
If you believed

1646
01:52:50,583 --> 01:52:53,333
They put a man on the moon

1647
01:52:53,417 --> 01:52:56,375
Man on the moon

1648
01:52:56,458 --> 01:52:58,667
If you believe

1649
01:52:58,750 --> 01:53:01,125
There 's nothing
up his sleeve

1650
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:04,583
- Then nothing is cool
- Nothing

1651
01:53:18,750 --> 01:53:20,875
If you believed

1652

fall silent

1664
01:54:04,667 --> 01:54:07,375
From your eyes

1665
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:14,000
All the sights
that I have seen

1666
01:54:18,417 --> 01:54:22,583
I can't believe
that I believed

1667
01:54:22,708 --> 01:54:26,875
I wish that you could see

1668
01:54:26,958 --> 01:54:31,375
There's a new planet

There is nothing

01:57:47,250 --> 01:57:50,542
So near

1708
01:57:50,667 --> 01:57:54,792
Although
I've got to leave

1709
01:57:54,917 --> 01:57:58,500
It 's the end

1710
01:57:58,583 --> 01:58:02,167
I'll always be stayin'

1711
01:58:02,250 --> 01:58:05,333
Right here

1712
01:58:06,458 --> 01:58:10,042
So, all my friends
good-bye

1713
01:58:10,167 --> 01:58:13,875
It's just about that time

1714
01:58:13,958 --> 01:58:17,208
Wish that I could do

1715
01:58:17,292 --> 01:58:20,292
Just one more song
For you

1716
01:58:20,417 --> 01:58:22,958
Good-bye, everybody!
Thank you! Good night!

1717
01:58:23,083 --> 01:58:24,958
Good night!

1718
01:58:25,083 --> 01:58:28,167
Okay! Great!
Good night!
