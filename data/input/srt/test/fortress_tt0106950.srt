00:56:57,176 --> 00:56:59,735
Truth is you're not gonna
get a parole, and you know it.

654
00:56:59,736 --> 00:57:02,735
You hold on to the hope
because you're a man,

655
00:57:02,736 --> 00:57:05,655
because you keep something inside
of you none of them can touch.

656
00:57:05,656 --> 00:57:08,455
But this is your chance
to fight back.

657
00:57:08,456 --> 00:57:12,506
Fight for who? You? Your husband?

658
00:57:14,696 --> 00:57:17,097
I've never begged before in my life.

659
00:57:18,216 --> 00:57:22,295
Please, Abraham. Please.

660
00:57:22,296 --> 00:57:26,096
If you won't do this for me,
do this for my baby.

661
00:57:32,936 --> 00:57:34,895
I gotta get this back
before he finds out.

662
00:57:34,896 --> 00:57:36,815
GOMEZ: What is it?
it's a map.

663
00:57:36,816 --> 00:57:41,015
Haven't you guys ever seen
a holographic lens before?

664
00:57:41,016 --> 00:57:43,940
Only problem is we need a laser
to make this thing work.

665
00:57:47,016 --> 00:57:48,495
We got a laser.

666
00:57:48,496 --> 00:57:51,615
You gonna stick your hand in there?
Now that's entertainment.

667
00:57:51,616 --> 00:57:53,505
We need something to hold it.

668
00:57:54,576 --> 00:57:57,055
Hey, wait a minute. Take that.

669
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,899
We got something.

670
00:58:04,976 --> 00:58:07,547
I'll be goddamned!
Whoa!

671
00:58:09,376 --> 00:58:10,343
Look.

672
00:58:11,856 --> 00:58:13,575
This could be a way out.

673
00:58:13,576 --> 00:58:15,415
D-DAY:

674
00:58:15,416 --> 00:58:16,535
Hold it steady!

675
00:58:16,536 --> 00:58:18,455
I'm any, um.

676
00:58:18,456 --> 00:58:20,982
This thing is just heating up.
Sorry.

677
00:58:24,136 --> 00:58:26,535
We go in through
the construction area here.

678
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:29,695
Through this heating pipe. See?

679
00:58:29,696 --> 00:58:32,935
It feeds into this utility shaft,
which goes all the way up...

680
00:58:32,936 --> 00:58:34,935
D-DAY: Shit! Wait a second.

681
00:58:34,936 --> 00:58:36,295
Ow! No!

682
00:58:36,296 --> 00:58:37,575
Shit!

683
00:58:37,576 --> 00:58:39,655
Q'-

684
00:58:39,656 --> 00:58:42,095
We don't get that fuckin' lens,
we're all dead.

685
00:58:42,096 --> 00:58:44,335
Fuck the lens.
I need my glasses, man.

686
00:58:44,336 --> 00:58:45,906
Move over.

687
00:59:03,176 --> 00:59:04,701
Did you get it, man?

688
00:59:15,696 --> 00:59:17,215
BRENNICK: Aaarrrrgghh!

689
00:59:17,216 --> 00:59:20,618
<i>ZED'. Laser perimeter intrusion.
Step back, please.</i>

690
00:59:23,136 --> 00:59:25,295
Shit, man, don't you hurt?

691
00:59:25,296 --> 00:59:26,741
Yeah!

692
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:29,335
How's the lens?

693
00:59:29,336 --> 00:59:31,737
It's fine. The motherfucker's fine.

694
00:59:35,936 --> 00:59:37,267
Whoa!

695
00:59:39,016 --> 00:59:43,175
You should see what you fools
look like through this thing, man!

696
00:59:43,176 --> 00:59:44,746
WOW!

697
00:59:48,016 --> 00:59:49,461
POE: I want you...

698
00:59:50,936 --> 00:59:52,665
...to divorce your husband.

699
00:59:54,336 --> 00:59:56,055
That's not part of our bargain.

700
00:59:56,056 --> 00:59:59,295
He will never leave this place.
You will never see him again.

701
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:02,135
He's become a cog
in the Fortress's grand design.

702
01:00:02,136 --> 01:00:03,706
Let me show you.

703
01:00:07,336 --> 01:00:09,815
Your husband is but one of many
whose only reason for being

704
01:00:09,816 --> 01:00:11,415
is the expansion of our facility.

705
01:00:11,416 --> 01:00:12,861
Hon.
(NO)

706
01:00:19,696 --> 01:00:22,335
Have you touched this?

707
01:00:22,336 --> 01:00:24,095
No.

708
01:00:24,096 --> 01:00:26,015
I noticed there was dust on the lens

709
01:00:26,016 --> 01:00:28,095
so I thought it'd be best
if I clean it.

710
01:00:28,096 --> 01:00:30,144
You fool, you smudged it!

711
01:00:31,176 --> 01:00:33,495
Do you know what it will cost
to repair this map?

712
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:35,135
I beg your indulgence.

713
01:00:35,136 --> 01:00:36,935
This will have a bearing
on your parole!

714
01:00:36,936 --> 01:00:38,381
I'm sorry.

715
01:00:54,176 --> 01:00:56,495
Divorce your husband.

716
01:00:56,496 --> 01:00:57,941
Marry me.

717
01:00:59,416 --> 01:01:03,575
And I will request permission
from the Men-Tel Corporation

718
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:05,624
to raise the child as my own.

719
01:01:08,936 --> 01:01:10,381
I'm telling you...

720
01:01:12,016 --> 01:01:14,223
...I will not enhance your child.

721
01:01:16,816 --> 01:01:18,341
Does this mean nothing'?

722
01:01:21,856 --> 01:01:23,301
And John?

723
01:01:29,056 --> 01:01:30,899
I will set him free.

724
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:36,329
Karen has to tell the man
yes or no by tomorrow night.

725
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:41,359
Good. We go tomorrow morning.

726
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,522
Hey! Time's up.

727
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,610
I think I got it, man.
Check this out.

728
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,321
Right there. Now look.

729
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,519
Here's something, yeah?

730
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:01,079
It's a magnetic detonator!

731
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,559
So'?

732
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,039
Didn't you go to grade school?

733
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,479
You get two magnets,
put a piece of paper in between,

734
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,959
<i>YOU move one...</i>

735
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,239
You can pull it out of us!

736
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:14,039
Well, yeah... In theory.
I haven't tried it yet.

737
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:17,479
I may just set it off,
give this cell a coat of red paint.

738
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,559
I don't know.

739
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,279
Let's find out.

740
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,759
What, you mean like right now'?

741
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:23,919
You got a better time?

742
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,839
No, man!

743
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,959
You turn into a burrito
and what happens to the rest of us'?

744
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,405
STIGGS: Try me.

745
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,399
I'm going with you.

746
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,845
GOMEZ: No way!

747
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:39,850
Look, you gonna do it...

748
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,327
...or what?

749
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,045
OK.

750
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:52,161
Er...

751
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,968
This might hurt a little bit, OK?

752
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,085
Where are you, man?

753
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,444
I Q I.

754
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,639
( Uuue )

755
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,919
Quit...fucking around, you asshole!

756
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,879
God! Shit!

757
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,247
Oh...God...

758
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:33,719
Oh, God. Get it out of me.

759
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:37,611
Asshole! (Groans)

760
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,204
Hey, hey, hey, no hurry, no worry.

761
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,879
Stop fooling around!
Get the damn thing out of him!

762
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:53,880
Yeah? VVhds fooling around?
I can't get this thing. it's stuck.

763
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,759
Come here.
I can't...

764
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,524
Come here.
What are you...?

765
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,519
(Retches and gasps)

766
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:05,729
Fuck. Fuck. Oh.

767
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,606
It's OK.

768
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,399
OK.

769
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,279
My turn.

770
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,719
Alright, man.
Somebody take notes, man.

771
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,799
After I finish with you, I won't
be able to do this on myself.

772
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,359
I'll do it to you.

773
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,919
After you do it to me.

774
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,559
What about your parole?
Parole? Bullshit.

775
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,559
It's time I woke up.

776
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,005
I'm going with you.

777
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,479
No. it's too much of a risk.

778
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,719
Afraid?

779
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:47,008
Afraid you'll lose us'?
Like you lost your platoon?

780
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:54,679
I don't ever want to be responsible
for another man's life again.

781
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,599
Hey, man...

782
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,759
...I'll speak for myself.

783
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:02,048
But it's better to die trying
than to die in here.

784
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,045
Right on, man.

785
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,006
Fuckin' A.

786
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:18,010
I haven't dreamt in 4O years.

787
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:25,759
John Brennick

and is hereby granted
a full pardon.

789
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:33,359
He is therefore
free to leave the Fortress...
