MAN:
Mr. Dufresne, describe...

3
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,047
...the confrontation you had with
your wife the night she was murdered.

4
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,387
It was very bitter.

5
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:23,058
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around.

6
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:28,063
And she said that she wanted
a divorce in Reno.

7
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,984
- What was your response?
- I told her I would not grant one.

8
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:35,362
"I'll see you in hell
before I see you in Reno."

9
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,907
Those were your words,
according to your neighbors.

If they say so.

11
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,621
I really don't remember. I was upset.

12
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,332
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

13
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,252
She packed a bag.

14
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,590
She packed a bag to go
and stay with Mr. Quentin.

15
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:59,344
D. A: Glenn Quentin, golf pro
at the Snowden Hills Country Club...

16
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,681
...whom you had discovered
was your wife's lover.

17
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,185
Did you follow her?

18
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,605
I went to a few bars first.

19
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:14,193
Later, I drove to his house
to confront them. They weren't home.

20
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,278
I parked in the turnout...

21
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:17,988
...and waited.

22
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,865
D. A:
With what intention?

ANDY:
I'm not sure.

24
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,494
I was confused...

25
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,954
...drunk.

26
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,582
I think...

27
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,959
...mostly I wanted to scare them.

28
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,504
When they arrived, you went up
to the house and murdered them.

29
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,798
ANDY:
No, I was sobering up.

30
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,677
I got back in the car
and I drove home to sleep it off.

31
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,847
Along the way, I threw my gun
into the Royal River.

32
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,141
I've been very clear on this point.

33
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:50,354
I get hazy where the cleaning woman
shows up the following morning...

34
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,148
...and finds your wife in bed
with her lover...

35
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,484
...riddled with.38-caliber bullets.

36
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:01,031
Does that strike you as a
fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

37
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,950
Yes, it does.

38
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,328
Yet you still maintain
you threw your gun into the river...

39
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,580
...before the murders took place.

40
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,999

It's the truth.

42

D. A: The police dragged that river for
three days, and nary a gun was found...

43
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:22,135
...so no comparison could be made
between your gun and the bullets...

44
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,764
...taken from the bloodstained corpses
of the victims.

45

And that also...

46

...is very convenient.
Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

47

48

...lying dead in each other's arms.

57

They had sinned.

58
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,326
But was their crime so great...

59
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,786
...as to merit a death sentence?

60
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,289
While you think about that...

61
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,542
...think about this:

62
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,130

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,051
I submit that this was not
a hot-blooded crime of passion.

That at least could be understood,
if not condoned.

No.

66
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,432
This was revenge...

67
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,269
...of a much more brutal,
cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

68

Four bullets per victim.

69
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,316
Not six shots fired, but eight.

70
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:03,445
That means that he fired
the gun empty...

71
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,448
...and then stopped to reload...

72
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,284
...so that he could shoot
each of them again.

73

00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:27,149
You think your shit smells
sweeter than most. Is that right?

317
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,817
What do you think?

318
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,279
To tell you the truth,
I haven't made up my mind.

319
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,200
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

320
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,454
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time.

321
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,623
I wonder if you might get me
a rock hammer.

322
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,251
- A what?
- A rock hammer.

323
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,295
- What is it and why?
- What do you care?

324
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,341
Well, if it was a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask.
I'd quote a price.

325
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,969
But then a toothbrush
is a non-lethal object, isn't it?

326
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,972
Fair enough.

327
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,016
A rock hammer is about
six or seven inches long.

328
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,561
- Looks like a miniature pickax.
- Pickax?

329
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,980
- For rocks.
- Rocks.

330
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,816
Quartz?

331
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,402
Quartz.

332
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:16,198
And some mica, shale...

333
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,701
...limestone.

334
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,077
So?

335
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,830
So I'm a rock hound.

336
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,375
At least I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again on a limited basis.

into somebody's skull.

If there's any trouble,
I won't use the rock hammer, okay?

Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

What's an item like this usually go for?

355

Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.

Let's make it an even 10 bucks.

...a walk and a talk that just
wasn't normal around here.

He strolled...

...like a man in the park without a care
or a worry in the world.

Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,801
Mr. Hadley...

473
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,053
...do you trust your wife?

474
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,140
Oh, that's funny.

475
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,351
You'll look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

476
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,855
What I mean is, do you think
she'd go behind your back?

477
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,401
Step aside, Mert. This fucker's
having himself an accident.

478
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,694
HEYWOOD:
He'll push him off!

479
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,737
Because if you trust her, you can keep...

480
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,322
...that 35,000.

481
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,117
HADLEY: What did you say?
ANDY: Thirty-five thousand.

482
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,119
HADLEY: Thirty-five thousand.
- All of it.

483
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,620
HADLEY: All of it?
- Every penny.

484
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,706
HADLEY:
You better start making sense.

485
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,250
If you want to keep it,
give it to your wife.

486
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:14,337
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

487
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,923
- Bullshit. Tax-free?
- Tax-free.

488
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,092
IRS can't touch one cent.

489
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,928
You're that smart banker
what killed his wife, aren't you?

490
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,557
Why should I believe a smart banker?
So I can end up in here with you?

491
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,602
It's perfectly legal. Go ask the IRS.
They'll say the same thing.

492
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:32,856
Actually, I feel stupid telling you this.
I'm sure you would have investigated.

493
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:36,735
I don't need you to tell me
where the bear shit in the buckwheat.

494
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:40,322
Of course not. But you do need
someone to set up the tax-free gift for you.

495
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,115
That'll cost you.
A lawyer, for example.

496
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,576
A bunch of ball-washing bastards!

497
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,496
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

498
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,790
You get the forms,
I'll prepare them for you...

499
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,751
...nearly free of charge.

500
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:57,297
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my coworkers.

501
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,634
"Coworkers." That's rich, ain't it?

502
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:03,136
I think a man working outdoors
feels more like a man...

503
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,806
...if he can have a bottle of suds.
That's only my opinion...

504
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,266
...sir.

505
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,147

TROUT:
Let's go! Work!

507
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,369
RED:
And that's how it came to pass...

508
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,247
...that on the second-to-last
day of the job...

509
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:35,001
...the convict crew that tarred
the factory roof in the spring of '49...

510
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:38,338
...wound up sitting in a row
at 10:00 in the morning...

511
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:44,010
...drinking icy-cold beer,
courtesy of the hardest screw...

512
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,514
...that ever walked a turn
at Shawshank State Prison.

513
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,141
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

514
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:55,814
RED: The colossal prick even managed
to sound magnanimous.

515
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:01,403
We sat and drank with the sun
on our shoulders and felt like free men.

516
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:05,198
Hell, we could have been tarring
the roof of one of our own houses.

517
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,243
We were the lords of all creation.

518
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,412
As for Andy...

519
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,290
...he spent that break
hunkered in the shade...

520
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,001
...a strange little smile on his face...

521
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,420
...watching us drink his beer.

522
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,887
HEYWOOD:
Hey. Want a cold one, Andy?

523
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,516
No, thanks. I gave up drinking.

524
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,565
RED: You could argue he'd done it
to curry a favor with the guards.

525
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:43,069
Or maybe make a few friends
among us cons.

526
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:44,863
Me?

527
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,866
I think he did it
just to feel normal again...

528
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,535
...if only for a short while.

529
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,247
King me.

530
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,752
- Chess. Now there's a game of kings.
- What?

531
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,712
Civilized. Strategic.

532
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,382
And a total fucking mystery. I hate it.

Let me teach you someday.

534
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:08,928
Sure.

535
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,139
We could get a board together.

536
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,434
You're talking to the right man.
I can get things, right?

537
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:18,646
We might do business on a board,
and I'll carve the pieces myself.

538
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:22,150
One side in alabaster, the opposing side
in soapstone. What do you think?

539
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,152
I think it'll take years.

540
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,905
Years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

541
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,074
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

kind of friends, aren't we?

Yeah, I guess.

628
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:50,079
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

629
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,790
To my knowledge,
he lived out the rest of his days...

630
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,084
...drinking his food through a straw.

631
00:45:56,086 --> 00:46:00,173
Andy could use a nice "welcome back"
when he gets out of the infirmary.

632
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,509
Sounds good to us.

633
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,262
I figure we owe him that much
for the beer.

634
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,265
The man likes to play chess.

635
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,684
Let's get him some rocks.

636

Guys!

637
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,386
I got one.

638
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,055
I got one. Look!

And it ain't alabaster either.

What are you, a fucking geologist?

641
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,065
SNOOZE:
He's right. It ain't.

642

- What the hell is it then?
RED: It's a horse apple.

643
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,571
- Bullshit!
RED: No, horseshit.

644
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,240
Petrified.

645
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,747
Oh, Jesus.

646
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,416
Damn!

647
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:21,963
RED: Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

648
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,173
And by the weekend
he was due back...

649
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:28,094
...we had enough rocks saved up
to keep him busy till rapture.

650
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,430
Also got a big shipment in that week.

651
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:32,807
Cigarettes...

652
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,058
...chewing gum...

653
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,726
...sipping whiskey...

654
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:39,313
...playing cards with naked ladies
on them. You name it.

655
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,275
And, of course, the most important item:

656
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,195
Rita Hayworth herself.

657
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:23,107
GUARD 1: Okay, look alive!
GUARD 2: Open all tiers.

658
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,568
Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

659
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:28,487
Heads up. They're tossing the cells!

On your feet.

663
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,509
Face the wall.

664
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,545
Turn around and face the warden.

665
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,221
NORTON:
Pleased to see you reading this.

666
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,474
Any favorite passages?

667
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,727
"Watch ye, therefore,
for ye know not...

668
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:44,146
...when the master
of the house cometh."

669
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:47,441
Mark 13:35.

670
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,069
I've always liked that one.

671
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,655
But I prefer:

"I am the light of the world.

Ye that followeth me
shall have the light of life."

674
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,580
John, chapter 8, verse 12.

I hear you're good with numbers.

676
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,084
How nice.

677
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,254
Man should have a skill.

678
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:11,841
Wanna explain this?

679
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:17,096
It's called a rock blanket.
For shaping and polishing rocks.

680
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,432
A little hobby of mine.

681
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,736
It's pretty clean.

682
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:35,114
Some contraband here,
but nothing to get in a twist over.

683
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,454
I can't say I approve of this.

684
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,540
But I suppose...

685
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,627
...exceptions can be made.

I'd hate to deprive you of this.

Yes, sir.

Tossing cells was just an excuse.

692
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,163
Truth is...

693
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,832
...Norton wanted to size Andy up.

694
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,848
My wife made that in church group.

695
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:46,811
Very nice, sir.

696
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,855
You enjoy working the laundry?

00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,192
No, sir. Not especially.

698
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,986
Perhaps we can find something more...

699
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,697
...befitting a man of your education.

Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?

702
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:12,878
Andy. I thought I heard you out here.

703
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,089

Ain't that a kick in the head?

Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.

00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:56,547
- Any questions?
- Brooks, how long have you been librarian?

719
00:52:56,756 --> 00:53:01,760
Oh... I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

720
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:05,264
And have you ever had an assistant?

721
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,933
No. Not much to it, really.

722
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:09,935
Why me? Why now?

723
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,645
I don't know.

724
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,899
But it'd be nice to have
some company down here.

That's him. That's the one.

I'm Dekins.

728
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,298
I was...

729
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:43,802
...thinking about setting up some kind of
trust fund for my kids' educations.

Oh. I see.

Well, um...

732
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:57,274
Why don't we have a seat
and talk it over.

733
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:03,447
Brooks, do you have a piece of paper
and a pencil?

734
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,085
Thanks.

735
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:17,836

Mr. Dekins...

737
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,260
And then Andy says, "Mr. Dekins...

738
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:27,471
...do you want your sons
to go to Harvard or Yale?"

739
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:28,722
He didn't say that!

740
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,558
As God as my witness!

741
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,560
Dekins just blinked for a second...

742
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,897
...then he laughed
and actually shook Andy's hand.

743
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,692
- My ass!
BROOKS: Shook his hand.

00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:42,736
I tell you, I near soiled myself!

745
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:47,199
All he needed was a suit and tie
and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...

746
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:50,035
...he'd have been
"Mr. Dufresne," if you please.

00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:51,870
Making a few friends, huh, Andy?

748
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,832
I wouldn't say "friends."

It might do more than that.

How about expanding the library.
Get some new books.

754
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,557
If you ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

755
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:16,270
- Right.
- How do you expect to do that? I mean...

756
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,440
...get new books in here,
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please."

00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:29,742
...one immutable, universal truth:

761
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,202
Not one of them born whose asshole...

762
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:36,415
...wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you ask for funds.

- The budget's stretched thin as it is.
- I see.

764
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,839
Perhaps I could write the state senate
and request funds directly from them.

765
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:48,135
They have only three ways to spend
the taxpayers' money for prisons:

766
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,763
More walls, more bars, more guards.

Still, I'd like to try, with permission.
A letter a week.

a letter a week...

772
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,697
...just like he said.

773

...Andy got no answers.

775

The following April, Andy did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

Year after that, he did them all...

00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,058
...including the warden's.

778
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:41,271
Year after that,
they rescheduled the intramural season...

779
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,899
...to coincide with tax season.

780

The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

Damn right. The holster too.

JIGGER: Hey, look who's here.
SNOOZE: Maestro!

948
01:11:08,305 --> 01:11:09,514
Hey.

949
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:13,559
You couldn't play something good, huh?
Like Hank Williams?

950
01:11:13,894 --> 01:11:16,688
They broke the door down
before I could take requests.

951
01:11:16,897 --> 01:11:20,024
- Was it worth two weeks?
- Easiest time I ever did.

952
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:22,568
No such thing as easy time in the hole.

953
01:11:22,736 --> 01:11:24,445
JIGGER:
A week in the hole is like a year.

01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:27,949
SNOOZE: Damn straight.
- I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

955
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:31,119
So they let you tote
that record player down there, huh?

956
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:34,914
It was in here.

957
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:37,000
In here.

958
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,211
That's the beauty of music. They...

959
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:42,755
...can't get that from you.

960
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,678
Haven't you ever felt
that way about music?

961
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:53,599
Well, I played a mean harmonica
as a younger man.

962
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:56,352
Lost interest in it, though.

963
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,146
Didn't make much sense in here.

964
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,481
ANDY:
Here's where it makes the most sense.

965
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:03,067
You need it so you don't forget.

966
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:04,944
Forget?

967
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:08,323
Forget that there are...

...places...

969

...in the world
that aren't made out of stone.

970
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:16,789
There's something...

971
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:18,541
...inside...

972
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:20,752
...that they can't get to...

973
01:12:20,961 --> 01:12:22,378
...that they can't touch.

974
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,297
That's yours.

01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:32,096
Hope.

977
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:36,059
Let me tell you something, my friend.

978
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:39,145
Hope is a dangerous thing.

979
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:42,648
Hope can drive a man insane.

980
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,526
It's got no use on the inside.

981
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:47,945
You'd better get used to that idea.

982
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:51,949

Says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

You feel you've been rehabilitated?

Oh, yes, sir.

987

Without a doubt.

988
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:37,787
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

989
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,707
No danger to society here.

990
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,793
God's honest truth.

991
01:13:46,338 --> 01:13:48,464
Absolutely rehabilitated.

992
01:13:58,434 --> 01:13:59,767
Thirty years.

993
01:14:01,728 --> 01:14:03,646
Jesus, when you say it like that...

994
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:06,315
You wonder where it went.

995
01:14:08,735 --> 01:14:10,903
I wonder where 10 years went.

996
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:16,909
Here.

997
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:20,079
A little parole-rejection present.

Go ahead and open it.

999
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:26,210
Went through one of your competitors.

1000

I hope you don't mind.
I wanted it to be a surprise.

It's very pretty.

No.

He wrote two letters a week

...just to shut him up.

And you'd be amazed how far
Andy could stretch it.

01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:57,445
He made deals with book clubs,

You'd like it. It's about a prison break.

...instituted his famous
"Inside Out" program.

1043

You may remember reading about it.

1044
01:18:20,278 --> 01:18:23,364
It made the papers
and got his picture in Look magazine.

1045

It's no free ride...

Sure it is, but not to me,

So he says:

1258
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:17,804
I got me this job one time,
busing tables at a country club...

1259
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:22,392
...so I could case all these big
rich pricks that come in.

1260
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,480
So I pick out this guy...

1261
01:31:27,398 --> 01:31:28,940
...go in one night...

1262
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:30,901
...and do his place.

1263
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,653
He wakes up...

1264
01:31:34,405 --> 01:31:36,156
...and gives me shit.

1265
01:31:37,241 --> 01:31:38,909
So I killed him.

1266
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:43,497
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1267
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:47,167
And that's the best part.

1268
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:50,295
She's fucking this prick, see...

1269
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:53,590
...this golf pro,
but she's married to some other guy.

1270
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:56,760
Some hotshot banker.

1271
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:00,680
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1272
01:32:12,151 --> 01:32:16,029
I have to say that's
the most amazing story I ever heard.

1273
01:32:17,281 --> 01:32:19,783
What amazes me most
is you'd be taken in by it.

1274
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:21,535
Sir?

1275
01:32:22,453 --> 01:32:27,332
Well, it's obvious this fellow Williams
is impressed with you.

1276
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:31,878
He hears your tale of woe
and naturally wants to cheer you up.

1277
01:32:32,088 --> 01:32:34,256
He's young, not terribly bright.

1278
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:38,218
It's not surprising he wouldn't
know what a state he put you in.

1279
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:40,178
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1280
01:32:40,972 --> 01:32:45,141
Well, let's say for the moment
this Blatch does exist.

1281
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:50,021
You think he'd just fall to his knees
and cry, "Yes, I did it. I confess.

1282
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:52,941
Oh, and by the way,
add a life term to my sentence."

1283
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:55,944
With Tommy's testimony,
I can get a new trial.

1284
01:32:56,153 --> 01:32:58,613
That's assuming Blatch is even still there.

1285
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:00,782
Chances are, he'd be released by now.

1286
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:05,579
They'd have his last known address,
names of relatives. It's a chance, isn't it?

1287
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:09,666
How can you be so obtuse?

1288
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:11,835
What?

1289
01:33:13,087 --> 01:33:14,546
What did you call me?

1290
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:16,506
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1291
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:18,341
You're forgetting yourself.

1292
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:21,636
The country club
will have his old timecards.

1293
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:24,598
Records, W-2s with his name on them.

1294
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:27,517
If you want to indulge this fantasy,
it's your business.

1295

Don't make it mine.
This meeting is over.

1296
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:33,106
Sir, if I got out, I'd never mention
what happens here.

1297
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:36,693
I'd be as indictable as you
for laundering that money.

1298
01:33:37,737 --> 01:33:41,531
Don't ever mention money to me again,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1299

Not in this office...

...not anywhere. Get in here, now!

1301

I just wanted to put you at ease,
that's all.

- Get him out of here.

This is my chance to get out!
It's my life! Don't you understand?!

That's the longest stretch
I ever heard of.

TOMMY:
It's all my fault.

Oh, bullshit.

1310
01:34:10,811 --> 01:34:13,521
You didn't pull the trigger
or convict him.

1311
01:34:13,731 --> 01:34:16,107
Are you saying Andy is innocent?

1312
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:18,360
I mean, for real innocent?

1313
01:34:18,569 --> 01:34:19,903
It looks that way.

1314

You going to open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1322

Thumb up my butt sounds better.

Give me that, you shithead.

Tommy, I'm asking you to keep
this conversation just between us.

I feel awkward enough as it is.

1415
01:43:15,939 --> 01:43:17,106
Say what?

1416
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:19,275
Zihuatanejo.

1417
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:21,861
It's in Mexico.

1418
01:43:23,238 --> 01:43:25,364
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1419
01:43:26,491 --> 01:43:29,285
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1420
01:43:29,453 --> 01:43:33,122
- No.
- They say it has no memory.

1421
01:43:35,083 --> 01:43:37,752
That's where I want to live
the rest of my life.

1422

Open up a little hotel...

1424
01:43:48,764 --> 01:43:50,264
...right on the beach.

1425
01:43:50,849 --> 01:43:53,059
Buy some worthless old boat...

1426
01:43:53,602 --> 01:43:55,228
...and fix it up new.

1427
01:43:57,981 --> 01:43:59,190
Take my guests out...

1428
01:44:00,025 --> 01:44:01,400
...charter fishing.

1429

Zihuatanejo.

1430

In a place like that, I could use
a man that knows how to get things.

1431

I don't think I could make it
on the outside, Andy.

Well, you underestimate yourself.

I don't think so.

for you, sure, but...

Shit.

1442

Scare me to death, something that big.

Not me.

1444

I didn't shoot my wife,
and I didn't shoot her lover.

1445
01:45:12,389 --> 01:45:15,599
Whatever mistakes I made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1446
01:45:16,643 --> 01:45:18,144
That hotel, that boat...

1447

It's down there and I'm in here.

1454

I guess it comes down
to a simple choice.

1455

Sure, Andy. Anything.

1461
01:46:15,786 --> 01:46:19,622
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1462
01:46:21,124 --> 01:46:24,251
- A lot of hayfields up there.
- One in particular.

1463
01:46:24,461 --> 01:46:28,381
It's got a long rock wall
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1464
01:46:28,590 --> 01:46:31,467
It's like something
out of a Robert Frost poem.

1465
01:46:32,386 --> 01:46:34,887
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1466
01:46:36,306 --> 01:46:38,391
We went there for a picnic...

1467
01:46:38,809 --> 01:46:40,893
...and made love under that oak...

1468

...find that spot.

1472
01:46:54,991 --> 01:46:59,829
At the base of that wall, there's a rock
that has no earthly business in Maine.

1473
01:47:00,956 --> 01:47:03,999
Piece of black, volcanic glass.

1474

Something's buried under it
I want you to have.

What, Andy?

1476
01:47:11,758 --> 01:47:13,509
What's buried under there?

1477
01:47:15,095 --> 01:47:16,971
You'll have to pry it up...

1478
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:18,431
...to see.

1479

No, I'm telling you. The guy is...

1480
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:28,691
He's talking funny.

1481
01:47:29,776 --> 01:47:31,485
I'm really worried about him.

Andy come down
to the loading dock today.

1487

He asked me for a length of rope.

1488
01:47:48,295 --> 01:47:51,005
- Rope?
- Six feet long.

1489
01:47:51,214 --> 01:47:52,590
And you gave it to him.

1490
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:55,259
Sure I did. Why wouldn't I?

1491

Never.

02:15:34,501 --> 02:15:36,001
Zihuatanejo.

1729
02:15:37,629 --> 02:15:41,215
ANDY: I could use a good man
to help me get my project on wheels.

1730
02:15:41,716 --> 02:15:45,261
I'll keep an eye out for you,
and the chessboard ready.

1731
02:15:46,054 --> 02:15:47,471
Remember, Red...

1732
02:15:47,806 --> 02:15:49,890
...hope is a good thing...

1733
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:52,101
...maybe the best of things.

1734
02:15:52,310 --> 02:15:54,478
And no good thing ever dies.

1735
02:15:55,021 --> 02:15:57,898
I will be hoping
that this letter finds you...

1736
02:15:58,066 --> 02:15:59,817
...and finds you well.

1737
02:16:00,318 --> 02:16:01,569
Your friend...

1738
02:16:01,736 --> 02:16:02,903
...Andy.

1739
02:16:36,771 --> 02:16:38,480
RED:
"Get busy living...

1740
02:16:38,690 --> 02:16:40,608
...or get busy dying."

1741
02:16:43,278 --> 02:16:45,446
That's goddamn right.

1742
02:16:50,702 --> 02:16:52,828
For the second time in my life...

1743
02:16:53,079 --> 02:16:55,623
...I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1744
02:16:56,708 --> 02:16:58,626
Parole violation.

1745
02:16:59,294 --> 02:17:02,963
Of course, I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

1746
02:17:03,632 --> 02:17:05,674
Not for an old crook like me.

1747
02:17:05,884 --> 02:17:07,927
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1748
02:17:11,598 --> 02:17:16,310
RED: I find I'm so excited I can barely
sit still or hold a thought in my head.

1749
02:17:16,770 --> 02:17:20,105
I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.

1750
02:17:20,315 --> 02:17:22,816
A free man at the start
of a long journey...

1751
02:17:22,984 --> 02:17:25,611
...whose conclusion is uncertain.

1752
02:17:28,615 --> 02:17:31,283
I hope I can make it across the border.

1753
02:17:32,786 --> 02:17:35,829
I hope to see my friend
and shake his hand.

1754
02:17:37,666 --> 02:17:41,752
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

1755
02:17:43,588 --> 02:17:44,797
I hope.
