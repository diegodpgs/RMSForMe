2
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,055
Saigon.

3
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:26,807
Shit.

4
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,561
l'm still only in Saigon.

5
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,615
Every time, I think I'm gonna wake up
back in the jungle.

6
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:52,333
When I was home after my first tour,
it was worse.

7
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,260
I'd wake up, and there'd be nothing.

8
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:15,356
I hardly said a word to my wife
until I said yes to a divorce.

9
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,070
When I was here, I wanted to be there.

10
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,867
When I was there, aII I couId think of
was getting back into the jungle.

11
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,123
l'm here a week now.

12
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,670
Waiting for a mission.

13
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,297
Getting softer.

14
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:48,806
Every minute l stay in this room,
l get weaker.

15
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,308
And every minute
Charlie squats in the bush,

16
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,060
he gets stronger.

17
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:02,028
Each time I Iooked around,
the walls moved in a little tighter.

18
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:44,380
Everyone gets everything he wants.

19
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,174
l wanted a mission.

20
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,511
And for my sins, they gave me one.

21
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,431
Brought it up to me like room service.

22
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,768
Captain Willard, are you in there?

23
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,104
Yeah, l'm coming.

24
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,857
lt was a real choice mission.

25
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:07,444
And when it was over,
l'd never want another.

26
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,706
-What do you want?
-Are you all right, Captain?

27
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,708
What does it look like?

28
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:32,636
-Are you Captain Willard, 505th Battalion?
-Affirmative.

29
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,263
-1 73rd Airborne?
-Yeah.

30
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,224
-Assigned to SOG?
-Hey, buddy, you gonna shut the door?

31
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:42,479
We have orders to escort you to the airfield.

32
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,484
-What are the charges?
-Sir?

33
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:48,569
What'd l do?

34
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:50,863
There's no charges, Captain.

35
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,867
You have orders to report
to COMSEC lntelligence at Nha Trang.

36
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,953
-l see.
-All right?

37
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,539
-Nha Trang for me?
-That's right.

38
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,168
Come on, Captain. You still have
a few hours to get cleaned up.

39
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,087
-l'm not feeling too good.
-Captain?

40
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,842
Dave, come here and give me a hand.
We got a dead one.

41
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,220
Come on, Captain. Let's take a shower.

42
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,096
-Don't be an ass.
-Get hold of him good.

43
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,349
We're gonna take a shower, Captain.

44
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,517
-ln we go.
-Now stand underneath this, Captain.

45
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:37,618
l was going to the worst place in the world
and l didn't even know it yet.

46
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,622
Weeks away
and hundreds of miles up a river

47
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,708
that snaked through the war
Iike a main circuit cabIe,

48
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,835
plugged straight into Kurtz.

49
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,630
lnsult me again and l'll kick your ass...

50
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,716
lt was no accident
that l got to be the caretaker

51
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,261
of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz's memory

52
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,973
any more than being back in Saigon
was an accident.

53
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,144
There is no way to tell his story
without telling my own.

54
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,897
And if his story is really a confession...

55
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,148
Captain Willard reporting, sir.

56
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,233
...then so is mine.

57
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,528
-Captain. Good. Come on in.
-Thank you, sir.

58
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:16,240
-Stand at ease.
-General.

59
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,619
Do you want a cigarette?

60
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,454
No, thank you, sir.

61
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,500
Captain, have you ever seen
this gentleman before?

62
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,710
No, sir.

63
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,671
-Met the General or myself?
-No, sir.

64
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,172
Not personally.

65
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,759
You've worked a lot on your own,
haven't you, Captain?

66
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:36,969
Yes, sir, l have.

67
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,512
Your report specifies lntelligence,

68
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,639
Counterintelligence with COMSEC, l Corps.

69
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,517
l'm not presently disposed
to discuss those operations, sir.

70
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,237
Did you not work for the ClA in l Corps?

71
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,782
No, sir.

72
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,535
Did you not assassinate
a government tax collector,

73
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,330
Quang Tri Province, June 1 8, 1 968?

74
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,375
Captain?

75
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:14,590
Sir, l am unaware
of any such activity or operation,

76
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:20,929
nor would l be disposed
to discuss such an operation

77
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,474
if it did, in fact, exist, sir.

78
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,613
l thought we'd have
a bite of lunch while we talk.

79
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,824
l hope you brought
a good appetite, Captain.

80
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,494
l noticed that you have

81
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,914
a bad hand, there. Are you wounded?

82
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,625
l had a little fishing accident on R&R, sir.

83
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,252
-Fishing on R&R?
-Yes, sir.

84
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,089
But you're feeling fit?
You're ready for duty?

85
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,466
Yes, General. Very much so, sir.

86
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,510
Well, let's see what we have here.

87
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:03,013
Roast beef, and usually it's not bad.

88
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:07,309
Try some, Jerry, and pass it around.

89
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,063
To save a little time,
we might pass both ways.

90
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,528
Captain, l don't know
how you feel about this shrimp,

91
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,863
but if you'll eat it,

92
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:23,158
you'll never have to prove your courage
in any other way.

93
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,204
Right, well,
why don't l just take a piece here?

94
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:31,625
Captain, you've heard
of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz?

95
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,255
Yes, sir, l've heard the name.

96
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,215
Jesus.

97
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,801
Operations officer, Fifth Special Forces.

98
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,971
Luke, would you play that tape
for the Captain, please?

99
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:47,516
-Yes, sir. l'm sorry, sir.
-Listen to this carefully, Captain.

100
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,729
October 9, 0430 hours,
sector Peter Victor King.

101
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,898
These were monitored out of Cambodia.

102
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,652
This has been verified
as Colonel Kurtz's voice.

103
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,488
l watched a snail

104
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,783
crawl along the edge

105
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,578
of a straight razor.

106
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,789
That's my dream.

107
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,751
lt's my nightmare.

108
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,256
Crawling, slithering

109
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,176
along the edge

110
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:27,014
of a straight razor,

111
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,767
and surviving.

112
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:38,108
Transmission 1 1 , received '68,
December 30, 0500 hours.

113
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,194
Sector King Zulu King.

114
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,072
But we must kill them.

115
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,366
We must incinerate them,

116
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,202
pig after pig,

117
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,413
cow after cow,

118
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,209
village after village,

119
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,044
army after army.

120
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,339
And they call me an assassin.

121
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:05,636
What do you call it
when the assassins accuse the assassin?

122
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,429
They lie.

123
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,516
They lie, and we have to be merciful

124
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,726
for those who lie.

125
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,563
Those nabobs,

126
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,275
l hate them.

127
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,153
l do hate them.

128
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,703
Walt Kurtz was one of the most
outstanding officers

129
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,914
this country's ever produced.

130
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:37,417
He was brilliant.
He was outstanding in every way.

131
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:40,796
And he was a good man, too.

132
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,798
A humanitarian man.

133
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,926
A man of wit and humor.

134
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,471
He joined the Special Forces.

135
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,350
And after that,

136
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,188
his ideas, methods,

137
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:01,942
became

138
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,779
unsound.

139
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,828
Unsound.

140
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:22,754
Now he's crossed into Cambodia
with this Montagnard army of his

141
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,592
that worship the man like a god.

142
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:30,804
And follow every order, however ridiculous.

143
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,310
Well, l have some other shocking news
to tell you.

144
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,354
Colonel Kurtz is about to be

145
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,024
arrested for murder.

146
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,902
l don't follow, sir. Murdered who?

147
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:50,032
Kurtz had ordered the execution
of some Vietnamese intelligence agents.

148
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,784
Men he believed were double agents.

149
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,872
So he took matters into his own hands.

150
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,126
Well, you see, Willard,

151
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,296
in this war, things get

152
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,674
confused out there.

153
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:12,095
Power, ideals, the old morality,

154
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,848
and practical military necessity.

155
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,311
But out there with these natives,

156
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,398
it must be a temptation

157
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,443
to be God.

158
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,408
Because there's a conflict
in every human heart

159
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,371
between the rational and the irrational,

160
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,082
between good and evil.

161
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,960
And good does not always triumph.

162
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,881
Sometimes

163
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,218
the dark side

164
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:56,264
overcomes what Lincoln called,
"The better angels of our nature."

165
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,602
Every man has got a breaking point.

166
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,230
You and l have them.

167
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,067
Walt Kurtz has reached his,

168
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,780
and very obviously he has gone insane.

169
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:28,922
Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.
Obviously insane.

170
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:37,139
Your mission is to proceed
up the Nung River in a Navy patrol boat,

171
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,935
pick up Colonel Kurtz's path at Nu Mung Ba,

172
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,272
follow it, learn what you can
along the way.

173
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,191
When you find the Colonel,
infiltrate his team

174
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,861
by whatever means available

175
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,780
and terminate the Colonel's command.

176
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,497
Terminate the Colonel?

177
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:08,003
He's out there operating
without any decent restraint,

178
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:13,800
totally beyond the pale
of any acceptable human conduct.

179
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:17,137
And he is still in the field,
commanding troops.

180
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,975
Terminate with extreme prejudice.

181
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:27,147
You understand, Captain,
that this mission does not exist,

182
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,817
nor will it ever exist.

183
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,834
How many people had l already killed?

184
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,838
There were those six
that l knew about for sure.

185
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,883
Close enough to blow their last breath
in my face.

186
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:44,182
But this time it was an American
and an officer.

187
00:19:55,736 --> 00:20:00,073
That wasn't supposed to make
any difference to me, but it did.

188
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:06,162
Shit, charging a man with murder
in this place

189
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:09,833
was like handing out speeding tickets
at the lndy 500.

190
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,089
l took the mission.
What the hell else was l gonna do?

191
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:21,595
But l really didn't know
what l'd do when l found him.

192
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:30,937
Did you check the tank?

193
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,731
Yeah.

194
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:37,944
l was being ferried down the coast
in a Navy PBR.

195
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:42,407
A type of plastic patrol boat,
a pretty common sight on the rivers.

196
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,118
They said it was a good way
to pick up information and move

197
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,454
without drawing a lot of attention.

198
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,456
And that was okay.

199
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,875
l needed the air and the time.

200
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,128
Only problem was, l wouldn't be alone.

201
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,047
Morning, Captain.

202
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,344
The crew were mostlyjust kids.

203
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,805
Rock 'n' rollers
with one foot in their graves.

204
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,225
-How old are you?
-Seventeen.

205
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,022
The machinist, the one they called Chef,
was from New Orleans.

206
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,650
He was wrapped too tight for Vietnam.

207
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,486
Probably wrapped too tight
for New Orleans.

208
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,280
Lance, on the forward .50s,
was a famous surfer

209
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,699
from the beaches south of LA.

210
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:28,411
To look at him, you wouldn't believe
he'd ever fired a weapon in his life.

211
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:34,876
Clean, Mr. Clean,
was from some South Bronx shithole,

212
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,045
and l think the light and space of Vietnam

213
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,339
really put the zap on his head.

214
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,636
Then there was Phillips, the Chief.

215
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:48,598
lt might have been my mission,
but it sure as shit was the Chief's boat.

216
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:50,934
There's about two points
where we can draw enough water

217
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,061
to get into the Nung River.

218
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,939
They're both hot, belong to Charlie.

219
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,067
Don't worry about it.

220
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,444
Don't smoke.

221
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:06,533
You know,
l've pulled a few special ops in here.

222
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:08,576
About six months ago,

223
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:12,539
l took a man who was going up
past the bridge at Do Luong.

224
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,709
He was regular Army, too.

225
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,880
l heard he shot himself in the head.

226
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:33,059
At first, l thought
they handed me the wrong dossier.

227
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,354
l couldn't believe
they wanted this man dead.

228
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,859
Third-generation West Point,
top of his class,

229
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:46,573
Korea, Airborne,
about 1 ,000 decorations, et cetera, et cetera.

230
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:54,247
l had heard his voice on the tape
and it really put the hook in me,

231
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:58,626
but l couldn't connect up
that voice with this man.

232
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,595
Like they said, he had an impressive career.

233
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,347
Maybe too impressive.

234
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:13,933
l mean, perfect.

235
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:18,855
He was being groomed
for one of the top slots in the corporation,

236
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,775
General, Chief of Staff, anything.

237
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:28,156
In 1964, he returned from a tour
with advisory command in Vietnam

238
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,283
and things started to slip.

239
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:34,913
His report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff
and Lyndon Johnson was restricted.

240
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,000
Seems they didn't dig
what he had to tell them.

241
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:43,797
During the next few months,
he made three requests for transfer

242
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:49,135
to Airborne training, Fort Benning, Georgia,
and was finally accepted.

243
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,306
Airborne?

244
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,811
He was 38 years old.

245
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:01,981
Why the fuck would he do that?

246
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:07,612
1966, joins Special Forces,

247
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,114
returns Vietnam.

248
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:13,868
-Hey, what's that?
-Arc light.

249
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,871
-What's that?
-B-52 strike.

250
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,748
Man.

251
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,208
-What's that?
-Arc light.

252
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,336
l hate that. Every time l hear that,
something terrible happens.

253
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,421
Charlie don't never see them
or hear them, man.

254
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,757
-There they are.
-Concussion will suck the air

255
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:29,175
out of your damn lungs.

256
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,887
-Something terrible is gonna happen.
-Smoke!

257
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,722
Secondary burning.

258
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,683
Hueys over there. Lots of Hueys.

259
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:37,809
Let's have a look, Chief.

260
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:44,065
It was the air cav, First of the Ninth.

261
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,608
That's them.

262
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:48,027
Our escorts to the mouth of the Nung River.

263
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,906
But they were supposed to be
waiting for us another 30 km ahead.

264
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:56,744
WeII, AirmobiIe,
those boys just couldn't stay put.

265
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,385
Kid, come on. Get down. Come on.

266
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:26,149
First of the Ninth
was an old cavalry division

267
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,777
that had cashed in its horses for choppers
and gone tear-assing around Nam

268
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,654
looking for the shit.

269
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:36,034
They'd given Charlie a few surprises
in their time here.

270
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:40,580
What they were mopping up now
hadn't even happened yet an hour ago.

271
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,167
Just keep running by. Run for television.

272
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,669
Don't look at the camera.
Just keep... Go on! Keep going.

273
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,338
This is for television.
Don't look at the camera.

274
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:49,505
Don't look at the camera.

275
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,799
Just go by like you're fighting.
Like you're fighting.

276
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,552
Don't look at the camera.
lt's for television. Just go through!

277
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:57,180
Go through! Just go by! Keep on going!

278
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:01,100
Keep going. Don't look at the camera.
Go on. Keep going.

279
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,707
Where can l find the CO?

280
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,085
That's the Colonel coming down!

281
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,597
The CO's on that chopper.

282
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:06,040
Lieutenant, bomb that tree line back
about 1 00 yards!

283
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,669
-Give me some room to breathe!
-Yes, sir!

284
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,467
-Body cards!
-Sir?

285
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,678
-Bring my body cards!
-Yes, sir!

286
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,309
l'm the fourth tank commander.
l got five tanks broken down.

287
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:28,354
We're all right with the tanks.
lt's all right, Captain.

288
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:29,897
Captain Willard!

289
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:33,776
l carry priority papers from
COMSEC lntelligence, ll Corps.

290
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:37,530
l understand Nha Trang has briefed you
on the requirements of my mission.

291
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,283
What mission?
l haven't heard from Nha Trang.

292
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:43,119
Sir, your unit is supposed
to escort us into the Nung!

293
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,121
-We'll see what we can do, but...
-Colonel.

294
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,040
...just stay out of my way
until this is done, Captain.

295
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,798
All right, let's see what we have.
Let's see what we have.

296
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:59,927
A two of spades, three of spades,
four of diamonds,

297
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,723
six of clubs, eight of spades.

298
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,060
There isn't one worth a jack
in the whole bunch.

299
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,895
Four of diamonds.

300
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:13,816
-Hey, Captain, what's that?
-Death cards!

301
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,986
-What?
-Death cards!

302
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:19,739
-Death?
-lt lets Charlie know who did this.

303
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,995
-Cheer up, son.
-We will not hurt or harm you.

304
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,706
-Fire in the hole!
-Fire in the hole!

305
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:36,923
This is an area that is controlled
by the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese.

306
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,055
We are here to help you.

307
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:50,645
-We are here to extend a welcome hand...
-Come on.

308
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,772
-...to those of you who would like...
-Everybody in?

309
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:56,442
...to return to the arms
of the South Vietnamese government.

310
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,570
Hurry up!

311
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,157
Move it out!

312
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:08,955
This is an area that is controlled
by the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese.

313
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,290
Hey! What's this?

314
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,793
What is this?

315
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,879
This man's hurt pretty bad, sir.

316
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:19,215
About the only thing
that's holding his guts in, sir,

317
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,800
-is that pot lid.
-Yeah?

318
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,510
What does he have to say?

319
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,263
This soldier is dirty VC.

320
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,724
He wants water. He can drink paddy water.

321
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,520
Get out of here! Give me that canteen.

322
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,481
-He's VC!
-Any man that's brave enough to...

323
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:38,401
Get out of here! l'll kick your fucking ass!

324
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:39,902
He killed a lot of our people!

325
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:42,822
Any man brave enough
to fight with his guts strapped on him

326
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,740
can drink from my canteen any day!

327
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:48,619
Hey, Colonel, l think one of those sailors
is Lance Johnson, the surfer.

328
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:51,497
-Where? Here? You sure?
-Down there.

329
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,417
Yeah? Here.

330
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:57,753
Repeat, we have a body count. We have...

331
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:04,760
-What's your name, sailor?
-Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson, sir!

332
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:07,972
-Gunner's Mate Third Class...
-Wait. Lance Johnson, the surfer?

333
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:11,601
-Yes, sir.
-Well, it's an honor to meet you, Lance.

334
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:14,020
l've admired your nose riding for years.

335
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:17,064
l like your cutback, too.
l think you have the best cutback there is.

336
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,859
-Thank you, sir.
-You can cut out the "sir" crap, Lance.

337
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,944
l'm Bill Kilgore. l'm a goofy foot.

338
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,030
-This guy with you?
-Yeah.

339
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:27,366
l want you to meet some guys.
This is Mike from San Diego.

340
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,076
-Far out.
-Johnny from Malibu.

341
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,287
-John, hi. Far out.
-Pretty solid surfers.

342
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,164
None of us are anywhere
near your class, though.

343
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,665
No way.

344
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,502
We do a lot of surfing around here, Lance.
l like to finish operations early,

345
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,714
fly down to Vung Tau for the evening glass.

346
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:44,175
-Been riding since you got here?
-No way.

347
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,385
l haven't surfed since l been here.

348
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,681
Through Christ our Lord,
from whom all good things come.

349
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,601
Through him in the unity of the Holy Spirit,

350
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,355
all glory and honor is yours,
Almighty Father. Amen.

351
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:01,400
Let us pray with confidence to the Father
in the words our savior gave us.

352
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:05,947
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

353
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,658
Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done

354
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:10,868
on Earth as it is in heaven.

355
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,079
Give us this day our daily bread...

356
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:18,000
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

357
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:21,545
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

358
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,600
Kilgore had had a pretty good day
for himself.

359
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:37,019
They choppered in the T-bones
and the beer

360
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:39,522
and turned the LZ into a beach party.

361
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,442
The more they tried
to make itjust like home,

362
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:46,070
the more they made everybody miss it.

363
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,532
Make my meat rare, rare but not cold!

364
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,165
Well, he wasn't a bad officer, l guess.

365
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:02,503
He loved his boys
and you felt safe with him.

366
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:06,173
He was one of those guys
that had that weird light around him.

367
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:09,593
You just knew he wasn't gonna get
so much as a scratch here.

368
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:13,514
What happened to your mission, Captain?
Nha Trang forget all about you?

369
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,232
Airborne.

370
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:28,279
Sir, two places we can get into the river...

371
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:31,073
-Yeah.
-...here and here.

372
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,617
lt's a pretty wide delta,
but these are the only two spots

373
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:34,952
l'm really sure of.

374
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:39,206
Well, that village you're pointing at
is kind of hairy, Willard.

375
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,959
-What do you mean "hairy," sir?
-lt's hairy,

376
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:43,794
got some pretty heavy ordnance.

377
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,672
l lost a few recon ships in there
now and again.

378
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,216
What's the name of that goddamn village?
Vin Drin...

379
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,469
-Dop.
-Dop or Lop?

380
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,680
Damn gook names all sound the same.

381
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,393
Mike, you know anything
about this point at Vin Drin Dop?

382
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,270
That's a fantastic peak.

383
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:03,981
-Peak?
-About six foot.

384
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:07,276
Yeah, it's an outstanding peak.
lt's got both the long right and left slide

385
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,487
with a bowl section. lt's unbelievable.

386
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,655
lt's just tube city.

387
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,453
Well, why didn't you tell me that before?
A good peak.

388
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:20,081
There aren't any good peaks
in this whole shitty country.

389
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,124
lt's all goddamn beach break.

390
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,210
lt's really hairy in there, sir.
That's where we lost McDonald.

391
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:25,544
They shot the hell out of us there.

392
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,381
That's Charlie's point.

393
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,301
Sir, we can go in there tomorrow at dawn.

394
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:34,345
There's always a good offshore breeze
in the morning.

395
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,555
We may not be able to get the boat in.

396
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,100
The draft at the mouth of that river
may be too shallow.

397
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,479
We'll pick your boat up and put it down
like a baby, right where you want it.

398
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,732
This is the First of the Ninth air cav, son.
Airmobile.

399
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,152
l can take that point and hold it
just as long as l like.

400
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:53,406
And you can get any place up that river
that suits you, young Captain.

401
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,616
Hell, a six-foot peak.

402
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,537
All right, take a gunship
back to the division.

403
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,705
Lance, go with Mike
and let him pick out a board for you,

404
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,541
and bring me my Yater Spoon, the 8'6".

405
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,127
-l don't know, sir, it's...
-What is it, soldier?

406
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:09,046
Well, l mean, it's pretty hairy in there.
lt's Charlie's point.

407
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:11,132
Charlie don't surf!

408
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:38,117
Hey, Jesus, Clean,
you ain't gonna believe this. Look.

409
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,621
Hey, man! They're picking up the boat!

410
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:49,295
-How are you feeling, Jimmy?
-Like a mean motherfucker, sir!

411
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,424
All right, son, let her rip.

412
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,217
Let's go!

413
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:22,137
l never have gotten used to a light board,
and l can't get used to one.

414
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:24,848
-l'm used to a heavy board.
-l know, it's a real drag.

415
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:28,394
-You prefer a heavy or a light board?
-Heavier.

416
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:29,687
-Really?
-Yeah!

417
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,814
l thought all the young guys
like lighter boards.

418
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,108
You can't ride the nose on those things.

419
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,528
Big Duke Six, this is Eagle Thrust Seven.
We've got it spotted.

420
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,990
Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust,
put on heading 2-7-0.

421
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,700
Assume attack formation.

422
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,494
That's a roger, Big Duke.
Okay, we're going in.

423
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:49,498
Lance, we'll come in low
out of the rising sun,

424
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:51,625
and about a mile out,
we'll put on the music.

425
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,420
-Music?
-Yeah, l use Wagner.

426
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:58,007
Scares the hell out of the slopes.
My boys love it.

427
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,718
Hey, they're gonna play music!

428
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:10,269
How come all you guys sit on your helmet?

429
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,023
So we don't get our balls blown off.

430
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:30,122
Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust,
put on psy war op, make it loud.

431
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:34,001
This is a Romeo Foxtrot. Shall we dance?

432
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,090
-Jimmy!
-Yes, sir!

433
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:20,918
Run, Charlie!

434
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:42,731
We got some...
There's more and more down there.

435
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:45,484
Look out, automatic .50-cal!
.50-cal in the open!

436
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:49,738
l've spotted a large weapon down below.
We're gonna go down and check it out.

437
00:40:49,823 --> 00:40:51,990
All right, this is Fox Five. We're going in.

438
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:06,129
-All right. What a shot.
-Outstanding, Red Team. Outstanding.

439
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:07,673
Get you a case of beer for that.

440
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,822
6-4-1 -0, we're over the village right now.

441
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,782
l think l see a vehicle
down in the courtyard.

442
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:37,035
-l'm gonna check it out.
-Well done, hawks. Well done.

443
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:40,372
l want some 20 Mike-Mike Vulcan
right along those tree lines.

444
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,291
Ripple the shit out of them.

445
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:44,793
Got a vehicle on the bridge,
.50 caliber onboard.

446
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:47,546
He's moving across to resupply the weapon.

447
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:51,425
Big Duke Six, clear the area.
l'm coming down myself.

448
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:52,968
Don't these people ever give up?

449
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,473
Nice shot, Bill.

450
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,935
-Shit!
-All right, all right!

451
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:07,316
-lt's just a flare!
-lt's a flare! Gotta get out of here!

452
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,359
Un-ass that shit. Get it out of here!

453
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:13,238
Get it out. lt's just a flare. lt's all right.
lt's just a flare.

454
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:16,575
-Everybody all right? Lance, you all right?
-l'm fine!

455
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:32,883
Get down!

456
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:57,658
l'm not going! l'm not going! l'm not going!

457
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:14,257
We just got a secondary
down there in the plaza.

458
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,219
BIue Three, BIue Four,
hold out over position...

459
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:20,138
Duke Six, Duke Six,
we've got wounded down there.

460
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,146
My God! Oh, my God!

461
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:32,150
-Get a stretcher over here!
-You're all right.

462
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,444
Please! Help me!

463
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,866
-Please, God! Help me!
-Stay with me, son, you're gonna be okay.

464
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:43,036
-Let's give him some morphine.
-My God! My God!

465
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:47,416
-0-3-7-7-4-2.
-Where's that duster?

466
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,252
l want my wounded out of there
and in the hospital in 1 5 minutes.

467
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,878
l want my men out.

468
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,964
Somebody stay in there tight with Big Duke.

469
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:58,010
This is 10-10. We're gonna be in,
throw them on and get out...

470
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,576
She's got a grenade! She's got a grenade!

471
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:27,456
Jesus! The whole goddamn thing just...

472
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,583
-She blew the shit out of...
-Fucking savages.

473
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:34,629
-Can l get a medevac?
-What's going on... Christ, she's a sapper.

474
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:36,798
l'm gonna get that dink bitch.
Get over there, Johnny.

475
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,884
Go in there.
Put that right skid right up her ass.

476
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:44,973
We gotta get some air in these trees.
lt's goddamn eat up with enemy down there.

477
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:47,350
l'm taking fire. l'm taking hits all over...

478
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:50,771
Three o'clock! Three o'clock, my position!
Drawing fire, drawing heavy fire!

479
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:54,524
l'm hit! Mayday! Mayday! l'm going in.
My tail rotor's out. l got control.

480
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:06,161
-What do you think?
-Wow, this is really exciting, man.

481
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:09,664
-No, no! The waves! The waves!
-Right.

482
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:12,501
Look at that, breaks both ways.
Watch. Watch.

483
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:15,962
Look! Good six-foot swells!

484
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,446
Come here, Lance.

485
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:45,867
lncoming!

486
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:53,500
This LZ is still pretty hot, sir.
Maybe you ought to surf somewhere else.

487
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,587
What do you know about surfing, Major?
You're from goddamn New Jersey.

488
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,633
Come here! Come here!

489
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,888
-Change!
-You mean right now, sir?

490
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:09,766
l wanna see how rideable that stuff is.
Go change.

491
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,476
lt's still pretty hairy out there, sir.

492
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:13,895
-Do you wanna surf, soldier?
-Yes, sir.

493
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,398
That's good, son,
'cause you either surf or fight.

494
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,483
That clear? Now get going.

495
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:22,154
l'll cover for them.
And bring a board for Lance!

496
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,532
We can't do shit until the boat gets here.

497
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:29,452
Lance, l'll bet you can't wait
to get out there.

498
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:31,580
-What?
-See how they break both ways?

499
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:35,542
One guy can break right, one left,
simultaneous. What do you think of that?

500
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,752
We ought to wait for the tide to come up.

501
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:40,630
-Lance, come here. Look. Look!
-lncoming!

502
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,927
The tide doesn't come in for six hours!

503
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:50,265
You wanna wait here for six hours?

504
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,729
Yo! Hey! Chief!

505
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:06,823
Okay, fellas, quit hiding. Come on!

506
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:09,784
-Let's go, dickheads, take off!
-God damn it!

507
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:12,579
Don't you think it's a little risky for R&R?

508
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:17,292
lf l say it's safe to surf this beach, Captain,
it's safe to surf this beach!

509
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:21,713
l mean, l'm not afraid to surf this place!
l'll surf this fucking place.

510
00:47:24,217 --> 00:47:26,218
Give me that RT, soldier.

511
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:29,930
Dove Four, this is Big Duke Six.

512
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:33,058
God damn it! l want that tree line bombed!

513
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:35,894
Big Duke Six, roger.
Dove One-Three, stand by.

514
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,896
Blow them into the Stone Age, son!

515
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,649
No, back, no!

516
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:44,736
All right, now. Let me take care of this.
You all right? Get that out of here!

517
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:48,156
-l'm sorry.
-Come here now. All right.

518
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:50,659
-No, ma'am. Sorry!
-Jimmy!

519
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:52,452
Hawk One-Two, Dove One-Three, roger.

520
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,496
They need some napalm
down there in the tree line.

521
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,331
Can you guys push ground
and put it down there?

522
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,291
Right, One-Three.
We're fixing to fuck with them.

523
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:01,002
-What's the target?
-We're trying to suppress some mortar fire

524
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:02,545
off the tree line down there.

525
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:05,340
-Roger. Here we come.
-Good, give it all you got.

526
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:07,842
Bring in all your ships.

527
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:10,470
Medevac him in my chopper.
Get him back to the hospital.

528
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:15,558
No, no, no, you got to go with him.
Come on! Go! Go!

529
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:18,603
Get it out of here!
And tell my guys l want my board!

530
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:20,230
Big Duke Six, this is Dove One-Three.

531
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:23,066
The jets are inbound now.
You got about 30 seconds to on-station.

532
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,902
Get your people back and heads down.
This is gonna be a big one.

533
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:30,782
Don't worry.

534
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:33,368
We'll have this place cleaned up
and ready in a jiffy, son.

535
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,953
Don't you worry.

536
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,788
Give me those shorts.

537
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:42,460
These are from the air cav,
a present from me and the boys.

538
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:46,089
l want to see you do
your stuff in them out there. Okay?

539
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,031
You smell that?

540
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:13,658
-Do you smell that?
-What?

541
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:16,202
Napalm, son.

542
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:19,039
Nothing else in the world smells like that.

543
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:21,458
Come on. Move it! Move it! Move it!

544
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,962
l love the smell of napalm in the morning.

545
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:29,132
You know, one time
we had a hill bombed for 1 2 hours.

546
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,593
And when it was all over, l walked up.

547
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,805
We didn't find one of them,
not one stinking dink body.

548
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:41,102
But the smell, you know,
that gasoline smell...

549
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:42,854
The whole hill,

550
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:45,690
it smelled like

551
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,652
victory.

552
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:57,160
Someday this war's gonna end.

553
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,635
Lance, the wind!

554
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:15,720
-The wind!
-What?

555
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:19,307
lt's blowing on shore! lt's coming on shore.
lt's gonna blow this place out!

556
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,852
-lt's gonna ruin it!
-Not cool! lt's gonna blow out!

557
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:25,271
lt's the goddamn napalm!
That's what's doing it!

558
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:28,775
l know. l'm really sorry, Colonel,
but l'm afraid that does it.

559
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:32,529
The kid's got a reputation. You can't
expect him to surf those sloppy waves.

560
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:35,115
-l understand what you're saying.
-Yeah, l'm an artist, Bill.

561
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:38,201
-l couldn't surf that stuff.
-Lance, look.

562
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,328
l apologize. lt's not my fault.

563
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:42,080
The waves are getting
blown out by the napalm.

564
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,164
Hey, Bill, don't get me wrong...

565
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:45,208
lt was the bombs causing
a vortex with the wind.

566
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:46,709
l accept your apology.

567
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:49,337
All right, then. But if you could
hang around just 20 minutes...

568
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:51,297
-Maybe some other time, Bill.
-Just 20 minutes.

569
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,926
-l'm an artist!
-Keep walking.

570
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:59,681
Okay, give it a try, guys!
One goes left and one goes right.

571
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:01,433
Look, Lance.

572
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:03,351
-You through surfing?
-Yeah!

573
00:51:03,436 --> 00:51:05,311
-Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
-No.

574
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:06,688
-You sure?
-Yeah!

575
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:09,983
-Let's get the fuck out of here!
-lt's the fucking napalm!

576
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,277
Just wait 20 minutes!

577
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,487
Damn! Fuck!

578
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,322
They're looking for you!

579
00:51:20,453 --> 00:51:22,829
-Don't leave without me!
-Where the fuck you going?

580
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:27,667
lncoming!

581
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:33,173
-The colonel's surfboard!
-Get the fuck off me! lt's mine!

582
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:38,470
-Guys, help!
-Get the board and let's get out of here!

583
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,184
Fucking Airborne!

584
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:18,426
-Lance.
-Chef, light up, man.

585
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:19,886
Come on. Let's get high.

586
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,930
-Want to smoke?
-Let's do it, man. Light up.

587
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:24,265
Someday this war's gonna end.

588
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,102
That would be just fine
with the boys on the boat.

589
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:30,480
They weren't looking
for anything more than a way home.

590
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:32,023
Captain?

591
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:38,154
TroubIe is, I'd been back there
and l knew that itjust didn't exist anymore.

592
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:44,285
Buddha time, here.

593
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:48,540
All right, that's great,
you motherfuckers. Yeah.

594
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:55,880
lf that's how Kilgore fought the war,

595
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:59,551
l began to wonder
what they really had against Kurtz.

596
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:02,720
lt wasn'tjust insanity and murder.

597
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:06,516
There was enough of that
to go around for everyone.

598
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,736
l mean, he never was hurting for pussy.

599
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,280
l'm not here.

600
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:24,534
l'm walking through the jungle
gathering mangos.

601
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,245
l meet Raquel Welch.

602
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:32,250
l make a nice mango cream pudding,

603
00:53:36,005 --> 00:53:38,339
kind of spread it around on us.

604
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:44,637
She's into mangos, too.
She's, like, one limb above me.

605
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,265
We're both in the jungle here, nude.

606
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,183
-Hey, Chief.
-Yeah?

607
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:51,227
Here comes that Colonel guy again.

608
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:56,065
You know how hard it is
to find a board you like?

609
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:02,530
l will not hurt or harm you.
l will not hurt or harm you.

610
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:07,869
Just give me back the board, Lance.
lt was a good board, and l like it.

611
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:11,247
You know how hard it is
to find a board you like.

612
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:13,041
He's a determined motherfucker!

613
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:14,667
l will not hurt or harm you.

614
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:18,212
-Cocksucker!
-l will not hurt or harm you.

615
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:21,132
Just give me back the board, Lance.

616
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:23,593
lt was a good board, and l like it.

617
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,263
You know how hard it is
to find a board you like.

618
00:54:28,641 --> 00:54:31,976
-l will not hurt or harm you.
-Jesus Christ.

619
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:34,062
That guy's too fucking much, man.

620
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:36,564
Do you think he would have shot us?

621
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:38,483
He wouldn't have shot us on the beach,

622
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:40,568
but l think he would have shot us
if he saw me taking his board.

623
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:45,948
Let's get this board out of my turret.

624
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,201
Sucker.

625
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,411
How am l going to shoot him
the next time he comes around?

626
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:52,538
Hey, Chef, make some room back there
for the board.

627
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:58,336
Sock it to me, Lance.

628
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,843
l wonder if that's the same chopper.

629
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:08,680
Hell, he's probably got them
all over the river with that recording.

630
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:11,099
We'll have to hole up here till dark, Chief.

631
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:13,518
Don't worry, Lance.
He won't follow us too far.

632
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:15,353
What makes you say that?

633
00:55:15,688 --> 00:55:17,480
You think that big cav colonel
wants everyone upriver

634
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,065
to know we stole his board?

635
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,525
l didn't steal it!

636
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:27,198
Captain? Just how far up this river
we going?

637
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,410
lt's classified, Chief. l can't tell you.

638
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:34,914
We're going up pretty far.

639
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:39,043
ls it gonna be hairy?

640
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:41,713
l don't know, kid.

641
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,382
Yeah, probably.

642
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:47,885
You like it like that, Captain,
when it's hot, hairy?

643
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:49,887
Fuck.

644
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:03,234
Never get a chance to know what the fuck
you are in some factory in Ohio.

645
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:09,907
Hey, Chief, l'm gonna go get
those mangoes now, okay?

646
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:12,326
-Take somebody with you.
-Yeah, l'll take...

647
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:14,078
l'll go with him.

648
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,252
Chef?

649
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,755
-Yes, sir?
-How come they call you that?

650
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:26,924
-Call me what, sir?
-Chef.

651
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,595
-Because you like mangos and stuff?
-No, sir, l'm a real chef.

652
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:35,057
-l'm a saucier.
-Saucier?

653
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:41,647
Yes, sir. See, l come from New Orleans.
l was raised to be a saucier,

654
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:43,608
a great saucier.

655
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:47,612
-What's a saucier?
-You specialize in sauces.

656
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:54,202
Gotta be a mango tree here somewhere.

657
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:05,213
Then l was supposed to go to Paris,
study at the Escoffier School.

658
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:09,550
But then l got orders for my physical.

659
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:25,900
Hell, l joined the Navy.
Heard they had better food.

660
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,278
A cook school, that did it.

661
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:33,324
-Yeah, how's that?
-You don't want to hear about that.

662
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:39,705
They lined us up in front of 1 00 yards
of prime rib.

663
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:43,084
All of us lined up, looking at it.

664
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,836
Magnificent meat, really.

665
00:57:46,547 --> 00:57:48,339
Beautifully marbled.

666
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:56,681
Next thing, they're throwing the meat
into these big cauldrons. All of it, boiling it.

667
00:57:57,975 --> 00:58:00,351
l looked inside, man. lt was turning gray.

668
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,896
l couldn't fucking believe that one.

669
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:07,984
That's when l applied for radioman school,
but then they gave me the...

670
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,569
What is it?

671
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:54,905
Charlie?

672
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,501
lt's a tiger!

673
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,882
Tiger, man! lt's a tiger!

674
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:16,594
Battle stations. Lance, up front!
On the .60, Clean!

675
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:17,928
-Got it, man.
-Holy shit.

676
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:21,849
-Chef, come on!
-Fucking tiger!

677
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:24,060
-Captain, come on!
-What's happening?

678
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,604
-Let's go!
-Tiger!

679
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:29,857
Chief, you were right.
Never get out of the fucking boat.

680
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:32,693
-Bring that .60 forward!
-Never get out of the boat!

681
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:38,115
Never get out of the boat!
l gotta remember. Never get out of the boat.

682
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:43,704
-What happened? How many is it?
-A fucking tiger!

683
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,581
-What?
-A fucking tiger!

684
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:48,125
-Tiger?
-Yes! l've had it!

685
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,837
l've had the whole
goddamn fucking shit, man!

686
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:56,425
You can kiss my ass on the county square,
because l'm fucking bugging out.

687
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:58,302
l didn't come here for this.

688
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:01,055
l don't fucking need it! l don't want it.

689
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:04,975
l didn't get out of the goddamn
eighth grade for this kind of shit!

690
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:10,856
All l wanted to do was fucking cook!
l just wanted to learn to fucking cook, man!

691
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:14,652
-lt's all right. lt's all right.
-What happened, bro?

692
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,698
You're all right. You're gonna be all right.

693
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:21,158
-All right. lt's gonna be all right.
-You're all right.

694
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:24,662
lt's gonna be all right.
Never get out of the fucking boat.

695
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:26,497
Never get out of the fucking boat.

696
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:29,834
Hi, tiger! Bye, tiger! Goodbye!

697
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:33,796
Never get out of the boat.

698
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:36,340
Absolutely goddamn right.

699
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:40,511
Unless you were going all the way.

700
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:47,643
Kurtz got off the boat.

701
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,564
He split from the whole fucking program.

702
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:59,655
How did that happen?
What did he see here that first tour?

703
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,789
Thirty-eight fucking years old.

704
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:14,587
lf you joined the Green Berets, there was
no way you'd ever get above colonel.

705
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,882
Kurtz knew what he was giving up.

706
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:23,846
And the more l read and began
to understand, the more I admired him.

707
01:01:25,474 --> 01:01:27,850
His family and friends
couIdn't understand it,

708
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:30,019
and they couldn't talk him out of it.

709
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:35,441
He had to apply three times
and he put up with a ton of shit.

710
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:38,569
But when he threatened to resign,
they gave it to him.

711
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:46,035
The next youngest guy in his class
was half his age.

712
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:49,663
They must have thought he was some
far-out oId man,

713
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:51,248
humping it over that course.

714
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,920
l did it when l was 19
and it damn near wasted me.

715
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:03,427
A tough motherfucker. He finished it.

716
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:11,894
He could have gone for General,
but he went for himself instead.

717
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:16,899
"Dear Eva,

718
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:22,780
"today was really a new one.
Almost got eaten alive by a fucking tiger.

719
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,201
"Really un-fucking-believable, you know?

720
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,329
"We're taking this guy, Captain Willard,
up the river,

721
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:33,207
"but he hasn't told us yet
where we're taking him."

722
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:38,462
"Thought you might have heard by now
from Elwood.

723
01:02:38,547 --> 01:02:41,173
-"l'll be coming home..."
-October 1967,

724
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:44,718
on special assignment,
Kon Tum Province, ll Corps.

725
01:02:44,845 --> 01:02:48,264
Kurtz staged Operation Archangel
with combined IocaI forces,

726
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,766
rated a major success.

727
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:58,482
He received no official clearance.
He just thought it up and did it.

728
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:02,403
What balls.

729
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:07,449
They were gonna nail his ass
to the floorboards for that one.

730
01:03:07,576 --> 01:03:11,662
But after the press got a hold of it,
they promoted him to full colonel instead.

731
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:18,878
Man, the bullshit piled up so fast
in Vietnam,

732
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:20,838
you needed wings to stay above it.

733
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:53,037
This sure enough is a bizarre sight
in the middle of this shit.

734
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,206
Expecting us this time?

735
01:03:58,543 --> 01:03:59,793
Damned if l know.

736
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:07,593
Hello. Hello...

737
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,011
Jesus.

738
01:04:15,644 --> 01:04:18,479
-Everything goes back up into the truck.
-What?

739
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,439
We gotta get all that stuff up.

740
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,365
Hau Phat. You ever been
up here before, Chef?

741
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:31,325
-Let's go!
-l bet you we can score up here.

742
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,203
Man, check out the bikes, Lance.

743
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:37,998
Yamaha, Suzuki. Yeah!

744
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:40,459
-That's a good one.
-Yeah, sukiyaki.

745
01:04:41,086 --> 01:04:42,461
Yeah, man. This is something.

746
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:48,342
-Please!
-This must be the guy.

747
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:50,052
Right over there.

748
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:53,263
Sergeant. Sergeant?

749
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:02,022
Three drums of diesel fuel, PBR 5.

750
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:04,942
Come on, man! Move! We don't have time.
One hour. That's all.

751
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:07,111
-What do you want?
-Can l get some Panama Red with it?

752
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,072
Panama Red. Yeah, l'll get you Panama Red.

753
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,866
-Sergeant?
-Destination?

754
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:14,576
-l don't have no destination.
-l can't do a goddamn thing

755
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:16,453
without a destination.
You got a destination?

756
01:05:16,538 --> 01:05:17,621
-Sergeant.
-l need diesel fuel.

757
01:05:17,706 --> 01:05:19,748
All right. You got a destination?
l need a destination.

758
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,875
l can't do a goddamn thing
without a destination.

759
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,878
Sarge, these guys are with me.
Destination's classified.

760
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:27,464
l carry priority papers
from COMSEC lntelligence, ll Corps.

761
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:30,551
Okay, right, sir.
Hey, listen, it's a real big night.

762
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:31,969
Eight bucks for that...

763
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:35,889
All right. Damn.

764
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:39,643
-Just give him some fuel.
-You got it.

765
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:42,896
-Dog starts barking.
-Hey, listen, Captain.

766
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:46,525
l'm really sorry about tonight.
lt's really bad around here.

767
01:05:47,736 --> 01:05:50,612
Just take this over to the man
at the supply desk and you got it.

768
01:05:50,739 --> 01:05:54,074
Hey, listen, would you guys like some seats,
some press box seats for the show?

769
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:57,036
You want those?
The show, man. The show out here.

770
01:05:57,579 --> 01:05:59,872
-Bunnies.
-Playboy bunnies?

771
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,749
You got it. You gonna be here?

772
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:06,879
Listen, Captain, on the house.
No hard feelings, huh?

773
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:48,462
How you doing out there?
l said, "How you doing out there?"

774
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:53,175
Want to say hello to you from all of us
up here to all of you out there

775
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:56,595
who worked so goddamn hard
in Operation Brute Force!

776
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:59,389
Hello, all you paratroopers out there!

777
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:03,018
And the Marines! And the sailors!

778
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:05,979
We want to let you know
that we're proud of you!

779
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:07,856
'Cause we know how tough
and how hard it's been.

780
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:09,399
Yeah!

781
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:12,945
And to prove it, we're gonna give you some
entertainment we know you're gonna like.

782
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:16,615
Miss August, Miss Sandra Beatty.

783
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:23,080
Miss May, Miss Terry Teray! Yeah!

784
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:28,585
And the Playmate of the Year,
Miss Carrie Foster! Yeah!

785
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,139
What's the matter?

786
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:25,184
They've got them here tonight.

787
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:32,649
Grease my gun!

788
01:08:40,992 --> 01:08:42,951
l'm ready to...baby!

789
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,054
You're cute. l like you.

790
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:05,224
l'm here, baby! l'm here!

791
01:09:07,352 --> 01:09:08,435
Oh, my God...

792
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,230
Yeah!

793
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:13,941
You fucking bitch!

794
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:15,234
Take it off!

795
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:20,739
Hey, lover! You want us to come over?

796
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:24,201
-l sure do!
-Sign my centerfold!

797
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,497
Sign my centerfold!

798
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:31,959
Come on, baby! Come up here now.

799
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:34,211
Get your goddamn hands off of my girl!

800
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:46,723
Start her up.

801
01:09:52,063 --> 01:09:53,313
Come on!

802
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,234
Will you sign these?

803
01:09:58,069 --> 01:09:59,987
Girls! Let's go!

804
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:19,840
So long!

805
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:04,426
Charlie didn't get much USO.

806
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:09,556
He was dug in too deep or moving too fast.

807
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:17,981
His idea of great R&R
was cold rice and a little rat meat.

808
01:11:20,568 --> 01:11:26,406
He had only two ways home,
death or victory.

809
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:40,962
No wonder Kurtz put a weed
up Command's ass.

810
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:45,342
The war was being run
by a bunch of four-star clowns

811
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:47,677
who were gonna end up
giving the whole circus away.

812
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:53,266
Man, that was far fucking out.

813
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:56,186
l collected every picture of her
since she was Miss December, Chief.

814
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:59,272
Hey, Clean, look at that. She was here, man.

815
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:02,859
l even wrote to the cunt.
She didn't write me back.

816
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:05,278
You can really get hung up
on these broads, man,

817
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:06,988
just like that cat in the delta.

818
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:08,698
-Yeah, you better believe it.
-What cat?

819
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:12,202
The one that went up for murder.
He was an Army sergeant.

820
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:15,997
Remember? This cat, man,
he really dug his Playboy, man.

821
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:21,753
l mean, this cat, when the thing arrived,
he was there to meet it, man.

822
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:24,548
Look at these beautiful fucking jugs, man!

823
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:28,051
Yeah. So anyway,
he was working ARVN patrols, you know,

824
01:12:28,136 --> 01:12:31,471
had one of them cocky gook
asshole lieutenants and shit.

825
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:34,850
And one day, the gook took his magazine
from him and wouldn't give it back to him.

826
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:36,768
He said, "Give me my magazine back."

827
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:40,939
Gook said, "You shut up.
l have you court-martial."

828
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:43,733
-Typical fucking ARVN.
-Yeah.

829
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:47,821
-So then the gook starts to go too far.
-Chef, take the wheel.

830
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:51,366
This dude started to stick
pinholes in the lady's titties.

831
01:12:51,993 --> 01:12:53,034
Take the wheel.

832
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:57,914
He started sticking pinholes and mutilating
the centerfold and all kinds of shit like that.

833
01:12:58,082 --> 01:13:00,876
And the sergeant said,
"You better not do that to her.

834
01:13:01,169 --> 01:13:03,462
"You leave your shitty little gook hands
off of that girl.

835
01:13:03,588 --> 01:13:04,963
"Don't do her like that," right?

836
01:13:05,256 --> 01:13:09,259
-Gook say, "Fuck you," in Vietnamese.
-Damn.

837
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:13,346
The sergeant, man,
he just couldn't handle it no more.

838
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:18,602
He just picked up his iron,
flipped it to rock 'n' roll and...

839
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:23,231
Gave that little zero a long burst
straight through the Playboy mag

840
01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:25,942
and blew his ass clean off of the dock.

841
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:30,155
There wasn't no more lieutenant that day.
That was it for his ass.

842
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:35,535
-They burn him for it?
-The sergeant? Yeah, man.

843
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:37,746
They stuck his ass in the LBJ.

844
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:41,041
lt's too bad he didn't get no medals
or nothing.

845
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:47,422
Fucking ARVN, man.
They should have killed the fuck.

846
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:51,468
Should have given the fucker a Silver Star.

847
01:13:53,471 --> 01:13:55,222
Bummer for the gook, though, ain't it?

848
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:05,357
Good morning, Vietnam.
l'm Army Specialist Zack Johnson on AFVN.

849
01:14:05,483 --> 01:14:09,110
lt's about 82 degrees in downtown Saigon
right now, also very humid.

850
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:11,488
And we have an important message
for all Gls

851
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:13,907
who are living off base
from the Mayor of Saigon.

852
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:14,991
Yeah!

853
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:17,827
He'd like you to hang your laundry up
indoors instead of on the windowsills.

854
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:20,163
The Mayor wants you
to keep Saigon beautiful.

855
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:22,916
And now, here's another blast from the past

856
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,752
going out to big Sam
who's all alone out there

857
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:27,963
with the First Battalion, 35th lnfantry,

858
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:32,384
and dedicated by the fire team
at An Khe to their groovy CO...

859
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:35,053
-The Rolling Stones, Satisfaction.
-All right!

860
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:38,848
Work out, Clean!

861
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:41,017
Get down, Bubba!

862
01:14:50,945 --> 01:14:52,362
Hang on, Lance!

863
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:00,870
Get down, Bubba!

864
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:11,214
Yeah!

865
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:23,059
l see you is right on target.

866
01:15:26,314 --> 01:15:28,815
Work out! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

867
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:30,275
All right!

868
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:32,402
Look out, Lance!

869
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:44,164
"Commitment and Counter-lnsurgency,
by Colonel Walter E. Kurtz.

870
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:50,128
"As long as our officers and troops perform
tours of duty limited to one year,

871
01:15:50,338 --> 01:15:53,423
"they will remain dilettantes in war
and tourists in Vietnam.

872
01:15:56,344 --> 01:15:59,179
"As long as cold beer, hot food, rock 'n' roll

873
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:02,015
"and all the other amenities
remain the expected norm,

874
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:04,643
"our conduct of the war
will gain only impotence.

875
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:07,103
"We need fewer men and better.

876
01:16:07,355 --> 01:16:11,608
"lf they were committed, this war could be
won with a fourth of our present force."

877
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:13,777
-Shit.
-Holy shit.

878
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:16,780
Chicken time. You ain't shitting, bro.
They're motherfucking...

879
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:21,242
-Who is that?
-What's going on?

880
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:25,538
ls that you, Lazzaro?

881
01:16:41,972 --> 01:16:45,308
-Fire on the canopy!
-l got it! l got it! Get out of there!

882
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:49,437
Get out! l got it! Yeah! l got it!

883
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:52,941
Lance, get down!

884
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:54,734
Put that fucker out, man!

885
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,785
What the fuck they think they're doing?

886
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:31,354
Late summer, autumn 1968.

887
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:35,734
Kurtz's patrols in the highlands
coming under frequent ambush.

888
01:17:36,694 --> 01:17:38,653
The camp started falling apart.

889
01:17:45,453 --> 01:17:46,703
November.

890
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:51,040
Kurtz orders assassination of three
Vietnamese men and one woman.

891
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:55,712
Two of the men were colonels
in the South Vietnamese army.

892
01:17:58,632 --> 01:18:01,760
Enemy activity in his old sector
dropped off to nothing.

893
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:07,307
Guess he must have hit
the right four people.

894
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:14,314
He joined the Special Forces.
And after that, his...

895
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:19,152
The Army tried one last time
to bring him back into the fold.

896
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:20,278
...methods...

897
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:23,156
And if he'd pulled over,
it all would have been forgotten.

898
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,282
...unsound.

899
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:27,911
-But he kept going...
-Now he's crossed into Cambodia...

900
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:29,829
...and he kept winning it his way...

901
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:31,831
...with this Montagnard army of his...

902
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:32,999
...and they called me in.

903
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:38,379
...man like a god. And follow every order,
however ridiculous.

904
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:45,386
They lost him. He was gone.

905
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:49,724
Nothing but rumors
and random intelligence,

906
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:51,851
mostly from captured VC.

907
01:18:53,938 --> 01:18:57,273
The VC knew his name by now,
and they were scared of him.

908
01:18:58,442 --> 01:19:01,569
He and his men were playing hit and run,
all the way into Cambodia.

909
01:19:07,827 --> 01:19:10,537
l know where l'm going.
l'm going to the White House

910
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:14,958
to have dinner with
the President of the United States, baby.

911
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:16,292
That's where l'm going.

912
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:19,295
Hey, Chef, put the cover on that.

913
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:22,298
Clean.

914
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:30,348
-How long has that kid been on this boat?
-Seven months.

915
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:33,977
He's really specializing in busting my balls.

916
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:36,980
Very possible, Captain,
he thinks the same of you.

917
01:19:37,857 --> 01:19:40,567
Yeah? What do you think, Chief?

918
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:42,402
l don't think.

919
01:19:43,654 --> 01:19:46,573
My orders say l'm not supposed to know
where l'm taking this boat, so l don't!

920
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:50,660
But one look at you,
and l know it's gonna be hot, wherever it is.

921
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:05,383
We're going upriver
about 75 klicks above the Do Luong bridge.

922
01:20:10,014 --> 01:20:13,016
-That's Cambodia, Captain.
-That's classified.

923
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:16,978
We're not supposed to be in Cambodia,
but that's where l'm going.

924
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:22,692
You just get me close to my destination,
and l'll cut you and the crew loose.

925
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:27,864
All right, Captain.

926
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:51,012
"Dear Son,

927
01:20:51,931 --> 01:20:53,640
"l'm afraid that both you and your mother

928
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:56,517
"will have been worried at not hearing
from me during the past weeks.

929
01:20:57,603 --> 01:21:00,063
"But my situation here
has become a difficult one.

930
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:04,359
"l have been officially accused of murder
by the Army.

931
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:14,661
"The alleged victims
were four Vietnamese double agents.

932
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:18,247
"We spent months uncovering them
and accumulating evidence.

933
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:24,921
"When absolute proof was completed,
we acted, we acted Iike soIdiers.

934
01:21:26,465 --> 01:21:28,257
"The charges are unjustified.

935
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:34,430
"They are, in fact, and in the circumstances
of this conflict, quite completely insane.

936
01:21:45,526 --> 01:21:48,778
"ln a war, there are many moments
for compassion and tender action.

937
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:54,951
"There are many moments for ruthless
action, what is often caIIed ruthIess,

938
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:58,663
"what may, in many circumstances,
be only clarity.

939
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:01,791
"Seeing clearly what there is
to be done and doing it."

940
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:02,917
Medevac, come in.

941
01:22:03,002 --> 01:22:05,712
"...directly, quickly, awake..."

942
01:22:05,796 --> 01:22:07,422
Alpha Tango Tango. Echo Tango Alpha...

943
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:09,132
-"...looking at it."
-...request dust-off.

944
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:11,050
Three, maybe four KlAs. Over.

945
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:13,886
"l will trust you to tell your mother
what you choose about this letter.

946
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:18,182
"As for the charges against me,
l am unconcerned."

947
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:19,267
Medevac, come in.

948
01:22:20,019 --> 01:22:23,980
"l am beyond their timid, lying morality.
And so l am beyond caring."

949
01:22:24,064 --> 01:22:25,648
Medevac, do you read? Over.

950
01:22:25,733 --> 01:22:29,110
"You have all my faith. Your loving father."

951
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:50,631
Jesus.

952
01:22:50,758 --> 01:22:52,967
No wonder l couldn't get them on the radio.

953
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:54,969
What a dump.

954
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:01,184
-Hi, there!
-How you doing?

955
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:05,188
Wow. That's a nice little boat you got there.
Never seen one up here before.

956
01:23:05,272 --> 01:23:08,649
You know, we called in a request
for a medevac. You guys receive it?

957
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:10,777
Medevac? No.

958
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:14,405
Yeah, we passed
a downed Huey with some KlAs.

959
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:16,365
-On your way here?
-Yeah.

960
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:19,494
-You going up this river?
-Way up.

961
01:23:19,953 --> 01:23:24,290
-Way upriver? Forget it.
-Why? Why?

962
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,210
Well, we want to send
some people downriver.

963
01:23:27,294 --> 01:23:29,796
-Just forget it.
-What the fuck was that?

964
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:33,341
-We'll be back in a couple of days.
-Yeah, right, you'll be back.

965
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:42,308
-Chief?
-Yeah, Captain?

966
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:43,810
Why don't you see
what you can do with that engine?

967
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:45,561
-l'm gonna have a look around.
-All right.

968
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,688
Hey, don't leave without me.

969
01:24:10,671 --> 01:24:14,382
-Hey, soldier, where's your CO?
-Don't ask me, man.

970
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:37,780
Give me my clothes back, asshole!

971
01:24:41,368 --> 01:24:42,368
Asshole!

972
01:24:48,125 --> 01:24:50,209
Hey, guys, where's the CO?

973
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:54,046
He stepped on a land mine
about two months ago.

974
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:57,466
-Got all blown to hell.
-Who's in charge here?

975
01:24:57,551 --> 01:25:01,053
Charge? l don't know, man.
l'm just the night man.

976
01:25:01,221 --> 01:25:04,765
Just doing what l'm told.
Shit, l'm just a working girl.

977
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:06,726
What about you, fella?

978
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:10,813
Lance, man, l'm telling you it's gonna jam.
You mark my words.

979
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:13,482
-Keep it in that condition.
-Hey, get off my back. Get off my back.

980
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:15,026
-No, man, l'm telling you.
-Lay off!

981
01:25:17,738 --> 01:25:20,656
Hey, hey, come here!

982
01:25:21,158 --> 01:25:23,534
ls that your boat? Come on inside.

983
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:26,746
What do you want?

984
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:29,498
Come on inside. l want to talk to you.
Come on!

985
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:34,295
Get out of the rain.

986
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:35,755
Get off me!

987
01:25:37,007 --> 01:25:39,467
Come on. Cut this shit. Hey, Chef. Come on.

988
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:43,512
Hey, how you doing, Captain?
l want you to meet some people.

989
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:50,102
-l got your ass.
-Your ass is shit, Chef. Your ass is shit.

990
01:25:50,187 --> 01:25:52,021
You're a motherfucker, man.

991
01:25:56,443 --> 01:25:58,319
What a motherfucker, man!

992
01:26:00,113 --> 01:26:02,531
God damn, my ear, you motherfucker!

993
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,787
Get him off me, Chef! You smartass.

994
01:26:09,957 --> 01:26:11,207
Hey, guys.

995
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:14,210
l got you! l got your ass!

996
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:17,380
-You ain't shit, Chef.
-Hey, fellas.

997
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:20,883
-You pulled my fucking...
-Guys.

998
01:26:22,219 --> 01:26:24,470
l just made a deal
with the people from Hau Phat.

999
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:28,808
l negotiated two barrels of fuel
for a couple of hours with the bunnies.

1000
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:38,150
Captain!

1001
01:26:38,777 --> 01:26:41,320
Hey, hey, you shitting me?

1002
01:26:41,405 --> 01:26:44,699
No, l'm not. Grab a couple of barrels
and get up to that big tent.

1003
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:46,242
Come on!

1004
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:49,412
Captain.

1005
01:26:50,914 --> 01:26:53,624
You're giving away our fuel
for a Playmate of the Month?

1006
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:56,460
Nope. Playmate of the Year, Chief.

1007
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:58,879
Warm them up, baby! Warm them up!

1008
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:01,340
Warm them up.

1009
01:27:01,425 --> 01:27:04,135
Captain, we get in a firefight
and run out of fuel,

1010
01:27:04,594 --> 01:27:06,262
l want you to tell me how she was.

1011
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:10,433
l made a deal for all of us, Chief.
How about you?

1012
01:27:14,938 --> 01:27:17,606
-You got some mamas in there?
-Some what?

1013
01:27:20,444 --> 01:27:23,070
Forget it, Captain. l'll stay with the boat.

1014
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:26,490
Hey, Captain, give me a hand.

1015
01:27:48,805 --> 01:27:54,185
l got every one of your pictures.
l got the centerfold, the Playmates Review,

1016
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:58,647
the Playmate of the Year runoff.
l even got the calendar.

1017
01:27:58,982 --> 01:28:00,941
Hey, oiseau.

1018
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:03,986
Wait, how come you got a bird?

1019
01:28:04,446 --> 01:28:06,614
l used to be the bird girl at Busch Gardens.

1020
01:28:07,324 --> 01:28:09,909
-Busch Gardens?
-Yeah, l used to train birds there.

1021
01:28:14,164 --> 01:28:16,749
-You are Miss December, aren't you?
-Miss May.

1022
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,459
ls it coming?

1023
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:28,386
-Miss December has black hair.
-lt's over there.

1024
01:28:29,179 --> 01:28:31,389
He's not one of my regular birds.

1025
01:28:33,183 --> 01:28:36,811
Come on. Come on, baby. Snack?
Snatch a crack. Come here.

1026
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:43,609
Being Playmate of the Year
is the loneliest experience l can imagine.

1027
01:28:45,112 --> 01:28:50,533
lt's like you try to express
your feelings to someone

1028
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:53,202
and show them your heart...

1029
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:57,039
Yeah, l want to hear about your bird act.
l'd love to hear about your bird act.

1030
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:05,965
But would you just mind
putting this black wig on for me, please?

1031
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:11,512
And there's this glass wall between you,
this invisible glass,

1032
01:29:12,139 --> 01:29:14,890
and they can see your mouth moving.

1033
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:17,476
l used to train birds for at least two years...

1034
01:29:17,561 --> 01:29:18,811
-That's beautiful, yeah.
-...at Busch Gardens.

1035
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:21,147
This was cascading
over your right shoulder,

1036
01:29:21,231 --> 01:29:22,940
and this, this was open here.

1037
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:25,776
But they can't hear what you're saying.

1038
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:30,990
l used to train them to stand on their head
and fly upside down and ride little bicycles.

1039
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:32,491
Your right hand was kind of over there.

1040
01:29:33,452 --> 01:29:36,370
-Hey, Chef!
-Hey, come on, get out of here, man!

1041
01:29:37,247 --> 01:29:39,832
-Later! Later!
-Does he want to talk to you?

1042
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:40,958
Give me 1 5 minutes.

1043
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:44,920
You can never really make them hear
what you're trying to say.

1044
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,922
You okay with kind of bending?

1045
01:29:47,007 --> 01:29:48,924
That's it. Yeah, your ass was sticking out
just a little...

1046
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:50,676
Hey, man, fuck off!

1047
01:29:50,886 --> 01:29:51,927
Fifteen minutes!

1048
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:55,723
That's why l tried so desperately

1049
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:00,436
to show somebody that l had some talent.

1050
01:30:00,604 --> 01:30:03,856
Little baby macaws.
Have you ever seen a baby macaw?

1051
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:05,733
-That's kind of...
-They're all blue.

1052
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:07,860
-Come on, man! Take off, would you?
-Open up!

1053
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:10,362
l got my rights, man!

1054
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:13,699
They make you do things
that you don't want to do.

1055
01:30:13,783 --> 01:30:17,953
Like... Like this picture here.

1056
01:30:20,499 --> 01:30:23,501
l started feeling repulsed with myself.

1057
01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:26,003
You were just kind of bending forward.

1058
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:28,130
-...really, really cute.
-Your ass, kind of out a bit.

1059
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:30,549
-l love training birds.
-That's it.

1060
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:34,094
That's it. That's it. Voila!

1061
01:30:35,347 --> 01:30:37,765
You're beautiful. l just want to...

1062
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:46,023
You know, l can't believe it. Me, Jay Hicks.
l can't believe l'm really here, you know?

1063
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:50,736
Maybe l'm unfit to have a relationship

1064
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:55,157
with a beautiful, innocent boy.

1065
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:59,203
Just think, if it hadn't been
for the Vietnam War,

1066
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:02,873
-l never would've met you, Miss December.
-Miss May.

1067
01:31:04,251 --> 01:31:09,672
l wish... l wish l could find just one person

1068
01:31:13,093 --> 01:31:15,177
that could share my point of view.

1069
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:23,978
You kiss like a bird!

1070
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,772
God! Kiss me, kiss me.

1071
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:28,816
Who is that?

1072
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:31,360
You're driving me crazy! Kiss me!

1073
01:31:32,862 --> 01:31:34,863
-Oh, my God.
-l love birds!

1074
01:31:39,995 --> 01:31:41,036
You finished yet?

1075
01:31:42,581 --> 01:31:44,123
Holy fuck!

1076
01:31:45,625 --> 01:31:51,046
Make like a bird! Make like a bird!
Fly, baby! Cockatoo me!

1077
01:31:51,381 --> 01:31:54,091
-Fly!
-l can fly like an eagle!

1078
01:31:54,259 --> 01:31:56,802
-Fly like an eagle!
-lt drives me crazy!

1079
01:31:56,886 --> 01:31:58,637
lt drives me crazy!

1080
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:11,400
Lance, that was somebody's son.

1081
01:32:14,738 --> 01:32:19,533
Lance, there were things
that they made me do

1082
01:32:19,618 --> 01:32:21,118
that l didn't want to do.

1083
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:24,955
They said,
"Pull the ribbons between your legs,"

1084
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,333
and l didn't want to do it,

1085
01:32:27,667 --> 01:32:31,295
but they said that was
what was expected of me,

1086
01:32:31,463 --> 01:32:33,756
that that's what people wanted to see.

1087
01:32:55,945 --> 01:32:59,031
-Who are you?
-l'm next, ma'am.

1088
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:02,493
Hell, l didn't know he was a cherry.

1089
01:33:02,619 --> 01:33:05,412
-Didn't know you never got no pussy.
-Shove it, fuck-up!

1090
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:08,624
Sure sorry about that. lf l had known,
l'd have taken you to New Orleans...

1091
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,335
-Man, fuck you.
-...introduce you to cooze, Bubba!

1092
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:14,338
-Lay off, Chef.
-Cherry boy. Cherry boy.

1093
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:17,091
You're a fucking dog!

1094
01:33:17,175 --> 01:33:20,260
Come on down to New Orleans, Bubba,
and l'll get you fixed up, you prick.

1095
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,553
Lay off, Chef.

1096
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:24,348
You're the only fucking prick
l see around here.

1097
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:26,892
lf l want to play with a prick,
l'll play with my own!

1098
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:29,186
-Lay off, Chef!
-What are you gonna do with it, cherry boy?

1099
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:31,271
-Fucking cherry boy!
-Chef, l said lay off!

1100
01:33:31,815 --> 01:33:34,358
Chef, knock it off! Give him a break!

1101
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:38,153
What do you think l said?
And give yourjaws a rest!

1102
01:33:38,905 --> 01:33:41,573
And this ain't the Army. You are a sailor!

1103
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:46,328
So get out of that frizzly Army-looking shirt
and stop smoking that dope!

1104
01:33:46,663 --> 01:33:47,663
You hear me?

1105
01:33:52,419 --> 01:33:55,003
Lance, what's with all the green paint?

1106
01:33:55,213 --> 01:33:57,047
-Camouflage.
-How's that?

1107
01:33:57,715 --> 01:33:59,299
So they can't see you.
They're everywhere, Chief.

1108
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:03,053
l want you to stay awake up there, man.
You got a job to do.

1109
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:24,032
Sampan off the port bow.
Sampan off the port bow.

1110
01:34:24,284 --> 01:34:26,994
Let's take a look. Lance.

1111
01:34:27,203 --> 01:34:30,247
Bring them in.
Clean, on the .60. Chef, get a .1 6.

1112
01:34:31,332 --> 01:34:33,041
Clean, get on that .60!

1113
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:37,379
What's up, Chief?

1114
01:34:39,716 --> 01:34:41,884
A junk boat, Captain.
We're gonna take a routine check.

1115
01:34:43,052 --> 01:34:45,012
Well, let's forget routine now
and let them go.

1116
01:34:45,305 --> 01:34:47,514
These boats are running supplies
in this delta, Captain.

1117
01:34:47,932 --> 01:34:49,057
l'm gonna take a look.

1118
01:34:50,727 --> 01:34:52,311
Chief, my mission's got priority here.

1119
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:54,855
Hell, you wouldn't even be
in this part of the river if it wasn't for me.

1120
01:34:55,899 --> 01:34:58,567
Until we reach your destination, Captain,
you're just on for the ride.

1121
01:35:00,153 --> 01:35:02,905
-Stand by, Lance.
-Come on, throw the rope, asshole.

1122
01:35:03,031 --> 01:35:05,240
All right. Come on. Let's bring it over.

1123
01:35:19,297 --> 01:35:21,423
Look in that forward hooch.
Bring the people out of there.

1124
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:31,099
Come on! Hurry up, motherfucker! Move it!

1125
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:35,938
-You two, come on.
-Keep your eyes open, Clean.

1126
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:37,481
l got you, Chief.

1127
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:43,070
lt's clear, Chief.

1128
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:52,287
Okay, that's them. That's them.

1129
01:35:52,372 --> 01:35:53,956
-They're okay.
-Board and search it.

1130
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:57,167
lt's just a fucking boat.
There ain't nothing on it, Chief.

1131
01:35:57,252 --> 01:35:58,544
Board it and search it.

1132
01:35:58,628 --> 01:36:00,963
Just some baskets and some ducks,
fucking bananas.

1133
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:03,090
-Ain't nothing on it.
-Don't be ashamed, Chef.

1134
01:36:03,216 --> 01:36:04,258
What's wrong with you?
Go on and search it.

1135
01:36:04,342 --> 01:36:06,468
There's a goat and some fish.

1136
01:36:07,262 --> 01:36:08,679
-Chef!
-Bunch of fucking vegetables.

1137
01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:11,014
-Get on that boat!
-There's nothing on it, man!

1138
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:12,641
-Get on it!
-All right!

1139
01:36:13,309 --> 01:36:15,269
Move it, asshole! God damn it!

1140
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:18,313
Just some pigs. Look, mangos.

1141
01:36:18,398 --> 01:36:20,399
-What's in the rice bag?
-Fucking rice.

1142
01:36:20,483 --> 01:36:23,110
-Look in there, Chef. Look in it.
-Some fucking fish.

1143
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:26,989
More coconuts. Rice. Here's rice.

1144
01:36:28,491 --> 01:36:29,866
What's in that vegetable basket?

1145
01:36:30,493 --> 01:36:31,952
Get out of here! Come on!

1146
01:36:32,245 --> 01:36:35,205
-Get over there, God damn it.
-Chef, check that vegetable basket.

1147
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:36,748
-All right!
-Shut up, slope.

1148
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:38,750
-There ain't nothing in here.
-What's in the boxes?

1149
01:36:38,835 --> 01:36:39,876
Not a fucking thing.

1150
01:36:39,961 --> 01:36:41,295
-Look in that tin can.
-Nothing.

1151
01:36:41,379 --> 01:36:43,755
-That rusty can.
-Just fucking rice, that's all!

1152
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,048
-There ain't nothing on it!
-Check the yellow can.

1153
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:47,426
Check the yellow can.
She was sitting on it. What's in it?

1154
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:53,015
Chef!

1155
01:36:57,687 --> 01:36:58,895
Motherfuckers!

1156
01:37:08,031 --> 01:37:09,948
-Hold it!
-Come on, let's kill them all.

1157
01:37:10,617 --> 01:37:13,201
-Fucking cocksucking mothers!
-Hold it! Hold it!

1158
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:15,954
Let's kill all the assholes!
Shoot the shit out of all of them.

1159
01:37:16,039 --> 01:37:19,207
-Chef, hold it!
-Why not? Jesus Christ.

1160
01:37:20,168 --> 01:37:22,294
Why the fuck not?

1161
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:25,339
-Clean?
-l'm good.

1162
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:36,141
-You okay, Lance?
-Shit! Fuck! Shit!

1163
01:37:36,225 --> 01:37:38,268
-Chef!
-Look what she was hiding, huh?

1164
01:37:38,728 --> 01:37:41,313
-You all right?
-See what she was running for?

1165
01:37:45,318 --> 01:37:49,529
lt's a fucking puppy.

1166
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:52,991
Give me that dog!

1167
01:37:53,076 --> 01:37:54,910
-No, you're not gonna get it!
-Fucking give it to me!

1168
01:37:54,994 --> 01:37:56,828
Give me the fucking dog, asshole!

1169
01:37:57,246 --> 01:38:00,916
-Fuck you! Fucking mango, too!
-Chef.

1170
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:02,542
You want that?

1171
01:38:02,627 --> 01:38:04,753
Chef, she's moving behind you.
She's alive. Check her out.

1172
01:38:05,755 --> 01:38:06,880
-Chef!
-Yes!

1173
01:38:06,964 --> 01:38:08,674
She's moving behind you. Check her out!

1174
01:38:08,758 --> 01:38:10,425
All right. All right.

1175
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:12,844
Come on, Clean, God damn it.
Give me a hand.

1176
01:38:12,929 --> 01:38:14,805
She's not dead, she's wounded.
Clean, give him a hand.

1177
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:19,267
Just take it easy. Take it easy.
Slow down and take it easy.

1178
01:38:19,936 --> 01:38:21,812
All right, Chef, just wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Chef.

1179
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:23,271
-Bring her up.
-ls she breathing, Chef?

1180
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:26,817
-She's hurt. She's bleeding.
-Man.

1181
01:38:27,110 --> 01:38:29,444
Bring her on board.
We're taking her to an ARVN.

1182
01:38:30,154 --> 01:38:31,238
What are you talking about?

1183
01:38:31,656 --> 01:38:33,031
We're taking her
to some friendlies, Captain.

1184
01:38:33,116 --> 01:38:34,616
She's wounded, she's not dead.

1185
01:38:35,118 --> 01:38:36,910
-Get out of there, Chef.
-The book says, Captain...

1186
01:38:48,464 --> 01:38:50,757
Fuck you. Fuck him.

1187
01:38:51,467 --> 01:38:53,176
l told you not to stop. Now let's go.

1188
01:39:54,363 --> 01:39:57,157
lt was the way we had over here
of living with ourselves.

1189
01:39:58,534 --> 01:40:01,453
We'd cut them in half with a machine gun
and give them a Band-Aid.

1190
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:10,879
It was a Iie, and the more I saw of them,
the more l hated lies.

1191
01:40:13,382 --> 01:40:17,385
Those boys were never gonna look at me
the same way again.

1192
01:40:18,095 --> 01:40:20,680
But l felt like l knew
one or two things about Kurtz

1193
01:40:20,765 --> 01:40:22,974
that weren't in the dossier.

1194
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:32,108
Do Luong bridge was the last Army outpost
on the Nung River.

1195
01:40:36,447 --> 01:40:38,782
Beyond that, there was only Kurtz.

1196
01:40:40,910 --> 01:40:44,538
Lance! Hey, Lance, what do you think?

1197
01:40:45,122 --> 01:40:46,164
lt's beautiful.

1198
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:50,961
l mean, what's the matter with you?
You're acting kind of weird.

1199
01:40:52,004 --> 01:40:54,589
Hey, you know that last tab of acid
l was saving?

1200
01:40:55,007 --> 01:40:57,509
-Yeah.
-l dropped it.

1201
01:40:57,677 --> 01:40:59,719
You dropped acid? Far out.

1202
01:41:12,275 --> 01:41:15,527
-Take me home.
-God damn you!

1203
01:41:25,079 --> 01:41:27,122
God damn!

1204
01:41:27,456 --> 01:41:29,583
You'll get what you deserve!

1205
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:40,552
ls there a Captain Willard onboard?

1206
01:41:40,636 --> 01:41:42,012
-Yeah!
-Captain Willard?

1207
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:44,931
-Yeah, who's that?
-Lieutenant Carlsen, sir.

1208
01:41:45,016 --> 01:41:46,600
Get that light off me.

1209
01:41:48,227 --> 01:41:51,062
l was sent here from Nha Trang with these
three days ago, sir.

1210
01:41:51,147 --> 01:41:54,316
Expected you here a little sooner.
This is mail for the boat.

1211
01:41:54,775 --> 01:41:56,568
You don't know
how happy this makes me, sir.

1212
01:41:56,652 --> 01:41:58,320
-Why?
-Now l can get out of here,

1213
01:41:58,404 --> 01:41:59,988
if l can find a way.

1214
01:42:03,993 --> 01:42:06,703
You're in the asshole of the world, Captain!

1215
01:42:11,459 --> 01:42:13,251
Captain, where you going?

1216
01:42:13,336 --> 01:42:16,004
See if l can find some fuel,
get some information.

1217
01:42:17,506 --> 01:42:21,426
-Pick me up on the other side of the bridge.
-Somebody go with him. Chef!

1218
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:24,346
l'll go. l wanna go.

1219
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:40,695
You get your ass in gear.

1220
01:43:16,565 --> 01:43:19,818
Come on, man. Listen to the music, man.

1221
01:43:20,277 --> 01:43:24,155
-Where can l find the CO?
-You came right to it, son of a bitch!

1222
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:27,575
Lance! Get down here!

1223
01:43:30,538 --> 01:43:34,582
-You still got a Commanding Officer here?
-Beverly Hills.

1224
01:43:34,917 --> 01:43:36,001
What?

1225
01:43:36,168 --> 01:43:40,964
Straight up the road, there's a concrete
fucking bunker called Beverly Hills.

1226
01:43:41,048 --> 01:43:43,633
Where the fuck else
do you think it would be?

1227
01:44:18,794 --> 01:44:21,713
-God damn it, you stepped in my face!
-We thought you were dead.

1228
01:44:21,797 --> 01:44:23,631
Well, you thought wrong, damn it.

1229
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:29,554
l told you to stop fucking with me, didn't l?

1230
01:44:29,638 --> 01:44:31,431
You think you're so bad, nigga?

1231
01:44:31,974 --> 01:44:33,349
What are you shooting at, soldier?

1232
01:44:33,434 --> 01:44:35,977
Gooks.
What the fuck you think l'm shooting at?

1233
01:44:36,604 --> 01:44:38,813
l'm sorry, sir.
There are gooks out there by the wire,

1234
01:44:38,898 --> 01:44:40,565
but l think l killed them all.

1235
01:44:40,649 --> 01:44:42,650
You ain't shot shit, man. Listen!

1236
01:44:44,570 --> 01:44:47,489
Shit, he's trying to call his friends, man.
Send up a flare.

1237
01:44:56,123 --> 01:44:58,291
You think you're so bad, nigga?
You think you bad, huh?

1238
01:44:58,375 --> 01:44:59,626
They're all dead, stupid.

1239
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:02,170
There's one still alive
underneath them bodies.

1240
01:45:02,671 --> 01:45:05,173
Who's the Commanding Officer here?

1241
01:45:05,341 --> 01:45:06,674
Ain't you?

1242
01:45:08,844 --> 01:45:12,680
You think you're so bad, huh?
l got something for your ass now, nigga!

1243
01:45:12,807 --> 01:45:14,557
l got something for you now!

1244
01:45:16,811 --> 01:45:18,520
He's underneath the bodies, man.

1245
01:45:20,272 --> 01:45:22,774
-Go get the roach, man.
-Go get the roach, man.

1246
01:45:22,858 --> 01:45:26,319
-Go get the roach, nigga!
-l'm gonna go get the roach.

1247
01:45:30,658 --> 01:45:34,244
Roach. Roach. Roach.

1248
01:45:35,037 --> 01:45:37,664
Got slopes on the wire, man.
Do you hear them?

1249
01:45:37,832 --> 01:45:40,500
-Lance!
-Do you hear them?

1250
01:45:45,047 --> 01:45:46,506
Go bust them!

1251
01:45:49,426 --> 01:45:52,387
Hey, Gl, fuck you!

1252
01:46:01,814 --> 01:46:04,065
You hear him out there on the wire, man?

1253
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:08,194
-Yeah.
-l'll kill you, Gl!

1254
01:46:08,279 --> 01:46:09,362
You need a flare?

1255
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:12,615
No.

1256
01:46:13,993 --> 01:46:15,827
He's close, man.

1257
01:46:16,537 --> 01:46:18,413
He's real close.

1258
01:46:40,269 --> 01:46:47,525
Gl, fuck you!

1259
01:46:52,865 --> 01:46:54,324
Motherfucker.

1260
01:46:55,451 --> 01:46:57,368
Hey, soldier,

1261
01:47:01,332 --> 01:47:03,291
do you know who's in command here?

1262
01:47:06,086 --> 01:47:07,170
Yeah.

1263
01:47:22,311 --> 01:47:23,811
Shit!

1264
01:47:28,317 --> 01:47:31,611
Yo, Chief, man,
two guys just got blown off that bridge.

1265
01:47:31,695 --> 01:47:34,239
You hang on, man. You're gonna be okay.

1266
01:47:38,494 --> 01:47:40,328
-What's that?
-Mail, man.

1267
01:47:40,412 --> 01:47:43,081
Later on the mail! Watch them trees.

1268
01:47:45,417 --> 01:47:47,961
There's no diesel fuel,
but l picked up some ammo.

1269
01:47:48,087 --> 01:47:49,671
Let's move out.

1270
01:47:49,755 --> 01:47:54,300
-Did you find the CO, Captain?
-There's no fucking CO here.

1271
01:47:55,803 --> 01:47:59,472
-Let's just get going.
-Which way, Captain?

1272
01:48:05,562 --> 01:48:07,563
You know which way, Chief.

1273
01:48:08,357 --> 01:48:10,149
You're on your own, Captain.

1274
01:48:11,568 --> 01:48:12,860
Do you wanna go on?

1275
01:48:13,362 --> 01:48:17,573
Like this bridge, we build it every night,
Charlie blows it right back up again

1276
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:20,326
just so the generals
can say the road's open.

1277
01:48:20,869 --> 01:48:22,370
Think about it.

1278
01:48:25,457 --> 01:48:27,875
-Who cares?
-Just get us upriver!

1279
01:48:32,381 --> 01:48:34,757
Chef, on the bow.

1280
01:48:35,926 --> 01:48:37,802
-Stand by, Clean.
-Let's go.

1281
01:49:34,568 --> 01:49:36,027
Whose package is that?

1282
01:49:36,278 --> 01:49:40,448
-Shit, you got another one, Clean.
-No shit. Wait a minute, is that it?

1283
01:49:40,783 --> 01:49:42,492
-That's it for you.
-Lance!

1284
01:49:43,327 --> 01:49:45,620
Mr. L.B. Johnson, there you go.

1285
01:49:47,164 --> 01:49:50,124
Far out, man. All right.
l've been waiting for this one.

1286
01:49:50,209 --> 01:49:52,877
l got another one, got a box from Eva.

1287
01:49:53,754 --> 01:49:56,297
"Lance, l'm fine. l'm fine, Lance.

1288
01:49:56,673 --> 01:50:00,468
"Sue and l went tripping to Disneyland.
Sue skinned her knee."

1289
01:50:00,636 --> 01:50:03,638
-Man, l want to get back to Antoine's.
-"Of course l remember the time we went..."

1290
01:50:03,722 --> 01:50:06,307
How could l fucking forget, man? Beautiful.

1291
01:50:07,393 --> 01:50:09,936
"There could never be a place
like Disneyland, or could there?

1292
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:11,270
"Let me know."

1293
01:50:11,355 --> 01:50:14,816
Jim, it's here. lt really is here.

1294
01:50:19,321 --> 01:50:21,656
"There has been a new development
regarding your mission

"which we must now communicate to you.

1296

"Months ago,
a man was ordered on a mission

Captain Richard Colby,

Fuck, man, this is better than Disneyland.

That's really weird, ain't it?

1309

-Purple haze, look.
-Hey, Lance, put away that smoke.

Eva can't picture me in Vietnam.

1313

Hey, Lance, man.

Eva's not sure if she can
have a relationship with me, you know?

1318

Here l am, 1 3,000 fucking miles away,
trying to keep a relationship open, my ass.

That's much more than l can say
for some of your friends.

lf this tape is any good,
l will have Dad and the family

Lance. Lance, check out Clean!

1329

Where's the dog?
We got to go back to get the dog!

-Hey, Clean.
-lt's always been nice to have...

-And so, l'm hoping...
-Bubba!

1334

...that pretty soon,
not too soon, but pretty soon,

1335
01:53:10,867 --> 01:53:14,579
l'll have a lot of grandchildren
to love and spoil,

1336
01:53:15,163 --> 01:53:18,124
and then when your wife get them back,
she'll be mad with me.

1337
01:53:20,544 --> 01:53:25,840
Even Aunt Jessie and Mama will come
to celebrate your coming home.

1338
01:53:26,341 --> 01:53:28,509
Granny and Dad

to get you a car.

1340
01:53:29,970 --> 01:53:33,514
But don't teII her, because that's our secret.

1341
01:53:34,891 --> 01:53:39,687
Anyhow, do the right thing,
stay out of the way of the bullets,

1342
01:53:40,230 --> 01:53:44,191
and bring your heinie home
all in one piece

1343
01:53:44,276 --> 01:53:48,487
because we love you very much.
Love, Mama.

1344
01:53:56,872 --> 01:54:00,207
Oh, man. You're so young.

1345
01:54:07,883 --> 01:54:09,550
Clean.

1346
01:55:22,416 --> 01:55:23,624
Hold on.

1347
01:55:26,461 --> 01:55:28,254
Throw me the glasses.

1348
01:55:40,559 --> 01:55:43,519
Lance, take the .1 6 on the bow.

1349
01:55:45,939 --> 01:55:49,191
Chef, Chef, on the .60.

1350
01:56:11,882 --> 01:56:13,132
Fuck me.

1351
01:56:50,879 --> 01:56:52,046
Lance.

1352
01:57:21,910 --> 01:57:25,746
Cover the Captain.
Lance, cover the Captain.

1353
01:57:43,723 --> 01:57:45,432
They're French. They're French.

1354
01:57:46,977 --> 01:57:50,062
Chef, pick up that weapon!
Pick it up! Pick it up!

1355
01:57:50,272 --> 01:57:52,106
Stand fast! Captain...

1356
01:58:27,517 --> 01:58:29,643
All right, you men, put down your weapons.

1357
01:59:18,693 --> 01:59:20,069
New Orleans.

1358
01:59:24,783 --> 01:59:26,617
We lost one of our men.

1359
01:59:30,330 --> 01:59:35,334
We French always pay respects
to the dead of our allies.

1360
01:59:37,045 --> 01:59:38,837
You are all welcome.

1361
01:59:41,591 --> 01:59:43,717
My name is Hubert de Marais.

1362
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:47,471
This is my family's plantation.

1363
01:59:48,390 --> 01:59:50,557
lt has been such for 70 years.

1364
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:55,312
And it will be such until we are all dead.

1365
02:02:07,445 --> 02:02:12,908
Captain, accept the flag of Tyrone Miller
on behalf of a grateful nation.

1366
02:02:33,263 --> 02:02:37,808
This food is really wonderful, isn't it?
The wine, the sauces. l can't believe it.

1367
02:02:37,892 --> 02:02:39,852
Can l speak with the chef?

1368
02:02:40,061 --> 02:02:42,020
The chef speaks only Vietnamese.

1369
02:02:42,355 --> 02:02:46,316
No kidding. He cooks like this
and he can't even speak French?

1370
02:02:46,401 --> 02:02:49,069
Hey, Lance, the chef's a slope.

1371
02:02:51,406 --> 02:02:52,906
Hey, Lance.

1372
02:03:21,686 --> 02:03:23,312
This is Baudelaire.

1373
02:03:23,396 --> 02:03:26,481
lt's a very cruel poem for children,
but they need it,

1374
02:03:26,566 --> 02:03:29,234
because life sometimes is very cruel.

1375
02:03:31,070 --> 02:03:32,696
As you can see...

1376
02:03:36,034 --> 02:03:39,870
-Attacks repelled by the family.
-Just for this war.

1377
02:03:40,371 --> 02:03:42,915
Viet Cong, 58.

1378
02:03:43,124 --> 02:03:44,958
North Vietnamese, 1 2.

1379
02:03:45,668 --> 02:03:47,544
South Vietnamese, 1 1 .

1380
02:03:48,463 --> 02:03:50,255
Americans, six.

1381
02:03:51,799 --> 02:03:54,635
Yes, well, they were perhaps mistakes.

1382
02:04:15,823 --> 02:04:18,742
May l present Captain Willard?
He's of a paratroop regiment.

1383
02:04:19,327 --> 02:04:21,495
-Madame Sarrault.
-Captain.

1384
02:04:49,190 --> 02:04:52,109
l'm sorry, Captain.
Was just a little story about Paris

1385
02:04:52,193 --> 02:04:53,443
and people starving during the war.

1386
02:04:53,528 --> 02:04:55,612
They are around the table
and there was a silence.

1387
02:04:55,697 --> 02:04:58,240
Somebody says, "An angel is passing by."

1388
02:04:58,574 --> 02:05:01,243
So somebody said, "Let's eat it."

1389
02:05:09,377 --> 02:05:12,713
How long can you possibly stay here?

1390
02:05:13,131 --> 02:05:14,673
We stay forever.

1391
02:05:15,425 --> 02:05:17,175
No, no, l mean,

1392
02:05:18,845 --> 02:05:20,887
when will you go back home to France?

1393
02:05:24,100 --> 02:05:25,851
l mean, this is our home, Captain.

1394
02:05:26,394 --> 02:05:28,061
-Sooner or later you're gonna...
-No!

1395
02:05:30,231 --> 02:05:33,900
You don't understand our mentality,
the French Officer mentality.

1396
02:05:34,861 --> 02:05:37,154
At first, we lose in Second World War.

1397
02:05:37,238 --> 02:05:40,032
l don't say that you Americans win,
but we lose.

1398
02:05:42,535 --> 02:05:45,412
ln Dien Bien Phu, we lose.
ln Nigeria, we lose.

1399
02:05:45,496 --> 02:05:47,289
ln lndochina, we lose.

1400
02:05:47,957 --> 02:05:50,417
But here, we don't lose.

1401
02:05:51,085 --> 02:05:56,173
This piece of earth, we keep it!
We will never lose that, never!

1402
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:03,430
The Americans,

1403
02:06:06,309 --> 02:06:09,269
in 1 945, yes,

1404
02:06:09,687 --> 02:06:11,772
after the Japanese War,

1405
02:06:12,607 --> 02:06:15,025
your President Roosevelt
didn't want the French people

1406
02:06:15,109 --> 02:06:17,194
to stay in lndochina.

1407
02:06:19,113 --> 02:06:21,907
So, you Americans

1408
02:06:21,991 --> 02:06:23,950
invent the Viet Minh.

1409
02:06:25,953 --> 02:06:27,788
-What's he mean?
-Yeah, that's true.

1410
02:06:27,997 --> 02:06:30,457
The Viet Cong were invented
by the Americans, sir.

1411
02:06:31,793 --> 02:06:33,001
The Americans?

1412
02:06:33,628 --> 02:06:37,964
Now you take the French place,
and the Viet Minh fight you,

1413
02:06:38,549 --> 02:06:40,425
and what can you do?

1414
02:06:40,510 --> 02:06:42,969
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

1415
02:06:43,137 --> 02:06:46,223
The Vietnamese are very intelligent.
You never know what they think.

1416
02:06:46,641 --> 02:06:48,642
The Russians want to help them.

1417
02:06:49,018 --> 02:06:51,645
"Come and give us some money.
We are all communists.

1418
02:06:51,979 --> 02:06:54,272
"Chinese, give us guns.
We are all brothers."

1419
02:06:54,357 --> 02:06:55,816
They hate the Chinese.

1420
02:06:56,692 --> 02:07:00,862
Maybe they hate Americans less
than the Russians and the Chinese.

1421
02:07:01,239 --> 02:07:02,948
l mean, if tomorrow
the Vietnamese are communists,

1422
02:07:03,032 --> 02:07:05,283
they will be Vietnamese communists.

1423
02:07:05,910 --> 02:07:08,620
And this is something
that you never understood, you Americans.

1424
02:07:09,330 --> 02:07:11,623
l don't know. Maybe in the future

1425
02:07:11,707 --> 02:07:14,167
we can make something with the Viet Minh.

1426
02:07:14,419 --> 02:07:16,002
Don't you understand?

1427
02:07:16,337 --> 02:07:19,047
The VC say, "Go away! Go away!"

1428
02:07:19,173 --> 02:07:21,883
That's finished for all the white people
in lndochina.

1429
02:07:21,968 --> 02:07:25,137
lf you're French, American,
that's all the same.

1430
02:07:25,346 --> 02:07:29,015
Go! They want to forget you. Look at them.

1431
02:07:31,144 --> 02:07:33,895
Look, this is the truth. An egg.

1432
02:07:37,066 --> 02:07:38,608
The white left.

1433
02:07:40,111 --> 02:07:41,987
The yellow stay.

1434
02:07:50,037 --> 02:07:51,204
When l was in Saigon,

1435
02:07:51,289 --> 02:07:55,041
l spoke to an American politician
and he explained it very well.

1436
02:07:55,126 --> 02:07:58,753
He said, "Look, yesterday it was Korea,

1437
02:07:58,838 --> 02:08:04,718
"today, Vietnam, tomorrow, Thailand,
the Philippines, and then maybe Europe."

1438
02:08:07,388 --> 02:08:08,513
Why not Europe?

1439
02:08:08,598 --> 02:08:10,974
Look what happened
in Czechoslovakia recently!

1440
02:08:11,142 --> 02:08:12,767
And even before the Second World War,

1441
02:08:12,852 --> 02:08:14,936
the Americans knew
exactly what was going on.

1442
02:08:15,021 --> 02:08:17,439
They don't want that shit to take over!

1443
02:08:20,359 --> 02:08:24,863
-All you white people are shit.
-They are fighting. Fighting for freedom.

1444
02:08:24,947 --> 02:08:27,073
Freedom? Bullshit.

1445
02:08:27,450 --> 02:08:30,160
French bullshit. American bullshit.

1446
02:08:30,620 --> 02:08:32,329
Dien Bien Phu is a trap.

1447
02:08:33,164 --> 02:08:36,249
All soldiers know they are already dead.

1448
02:08:38,294 --> 02:08:40,212
You know anything about Dien Bien Phu?

1449
02:08:43,341 --> 02:08:47,302
-Yeah, l know.
-No, you don't, not really.

1450
02:08:47,386 --> 02:08:50,388
Dien Bien Phu was an error, you know?
A military mistake.

1451
02:08:50,515 --> 02:08:54,184
A mistake? A voluntary mistake! Voluntary!

1452
02:08:56,896 --> 02:09:00,857
All the soldiers knew.
We knew we would be dead.

1453
02:09:01,609 --> 02:09:03,360
Generals and colonels
believe it's impossible

1454
02:09:03,444 --> 02:09:07,739
for the Viets to get a cannon
up there in the mountains, but they do.

1455
02:09:08,491 --> 02:09:11,284
Then they wait for the rain to come.

1456
02:09:12,453 --> 02:09:16,498
When it comes, no airplane can fly there.

1457
02:09:16,707 --> 02:09:22,337
And our paratroopers jump at 90 meters.
l mean, you know, 90 meters, 70 meters...

1458
02:09:22,421 --> 02:09:25,590
l mean, that's crazy.
No army in the world can do that.

1459
02:09:26,175 --> 02:09:29,636
And they only do that
to be dead with their friends.

1460
02:09:31,639 --> 02:09:32,973
No, no!

1461
02:09:36,143 --> 02:09:38,311
The French army was sacrificed,

1462
02:09:38,521 --> 02:09:41,231
sacrificed by the politicians safe at home.

1463
02:09:41,315 --> 02:09:44,025
They put the army in an impossible
situation where they couldn't win.

1464
02:09:45,236 --> 02:09:48,738
The students are marching in Paris,
protesting, demonstrating.

1465
02:09:48,823 --> 02:09:50,949
They stab the soldiers in the back.

1466
02:09:51,075 --> 02:09:54,953
The soldier would open the grenade,
it wouldn't work.

1467
02:09:55,246 --> 02:09:57,038
A piece of paper would fall.

1468
02:09:59,417 --> 02:10:02,669
Union of French Women.
"We are for the Viets."

1469
02:10:02,962 --> 02:10:04,212
Traitors.

1470
02:10:04,672 --> 02:10:06,798
Communist traitors at home.

1471
02:10:08,217 --> 02:10:09,759
Dien Bien Phu...

1472
02:10:10,136 --> 02:10:12,679
Okay, the French is shit.

1473
02:10:14,807 --> 02:10:17,100
No one cares. No one wants to.

1474
02:10:19,729 --> 02:10:23,690
Why don't you Americans learn from us?
From our mistakes?

1475
02:10:24,025 --> 02:10:26,026
Mon dieu, with your army,
your strength, your power,

1476
02:10:26,110 --> 02:10:27,319
you can win if you want to.

1477
02:10:30,364 --> 02:10:31,781
You can win.

1478
02:10:34,994 --> 02:10:38,204
You know,
l'm sure we can make something there.

1479
02:10:38,956 --> 02:10:40,540
l'm sure about it, you know?

1480
02:10:41,083 --> 02:10:43,627
l never do something wrong
to the people here.

1481
02:10:44,211 --> 02:10:47,631
l'm sorry, you know, but the communists
at home have never been traitors.

1482
02:11:21,582 --> 02:11:24,918
Excuse me. l have to go.
Captain, good night.

1483
02:11:25,252 --> 02:11:27,837
-l was a socialist, you know?
-l know we can stay.

1484
02:11:27,922 --> 02:11:31,925
l know that we can stay. We can stay.

1485
02:11:34,845 --> 02:11:38,223
You know, we always help the people.

1486
02:11:38,307 --> 02:11:40,016
We work with the people.

1487
02:11:56,575 --> 02:12:00,704
See, Captain, when my grandfather

1488
02:12:02,164 --> 02:12:04,416
and my uncles and father came here,

1489
02:12:07,002 --> 02:12:09,587
there was nothing. Nothing.

1490
02:12:10,965 --> 02:12:13,133
The Vietnamese were nothing.

1491
02:12:15,052 --> 02:12:18,805
So, we worked hard, very hard.

1492
02:12:18,973 --> 02:12:23,768
We brought the rubber from Brazil
and then planted it here.

1493
02:12:24,687 --> 02:12:27,981
We took the Vietnamese, work with them,

1494
02:12:28,399 --> 02:12:29,733
make something.

1495
02:12:30,484 --> 02:12:32,485
Something out of nothing.

1496
02:12:34,071 --> 02:12:37,741
So when you ask me
why we want to stay here, Captain,

1497
02:12:39,326 --> 02:12:41,745
we want to stay here because it's ours.

1498
02:12:41,829 --> 02:12:43,288
lt belongs to us.

1499
02:12:43,998 --> 02:12:45,665
lt keeps our family together.

1500
02:12:47,418 --> 02:12:49,419
l mean, we fight for that.

1501
02:12:51,338 --> 02:12:53,131
While you Americans,

1502
02:12:54,049 --> 02:12:58,928
you are fighting
for the biggest nothing in history.

1503
02:13:06,896 --> 02:13:08,646
l'm sorry, Captain.

1504
02:13:09,148 --> 02:13:13,860
l will see if your men
need any help to repair your boat

1505
02:13:14,153 --> 02:13:17,530
so that you can go on with your war.

1506
02:13:52,691 --> 02:13:55,360
l apologize for my family, Captain.

1507
02:13:57,404 --> 02:13:59,531
We have all lost much here.

1508
02:14:01,075 --> 02:14:04,160
Hubert, his wife and two sons.

1509
02:14:08,582 --> 02:14:10,750
And l have lost a husband.

1510
02:14:16,674 --> 02:14:20,468
-l understand.
-You are tired of the war.

1511
02:14:22,555 --> 02:14:24,681
l can see on your face.

1512
02:14:27,309 --> 02:14:31,437
lt was the same in the eyes
of the soldiers of our war.

1513
02:14:32,648 --> 02:14:33,690
We call them...

1514
02:14:36,819 --> 02:14:38,611
"The lost soldiers."

1515
02:14:43,492 --> 02:14:46,035
lf you like, we can have some cognac.

1516
02:14:50,791 --> 02:14:52,041
No.

1517
02:14:52,835 --> 02:14:55,795
l'll see about my men and...

1518
02:15:03,596 --> 02:15:06,180
The war will be still here tomorrow.

1519
02:15:16,942 --> 02:15:18,985
Yeah, l guess you're right.

1520
02:15:26,994 --> 02:15:29,662
l noticed you had no wine at dinner.

1521
02:15:30,915 --> 02:15:33,583
No, l don't drink wine.

1522
02:15:37,004 --> 02:15:41,507
l do like cognac,
but l don't want any now, thank you.

1523
02:15:45,137 --> 02:15:47,889
Well, then l must drink alone.

1524
02:15:58,192 --> 02:16:01,569
Will you go back, after the war, to America?

1525
02:16:05,532 --> 02:16:08,534
-No.
-Then you're like us.

1526
02:16:08,786 --> 02:16:10,453
Your home is here.

1527
02:16:28,055 --> 02:16:31,975
Do you know why you can never
step into the same river twice?

1528
02:16:34,228 --> 02:16:37,397
Yeah, 'cause it's always moving.

1529
02:16:38,816 --> 02:16:41,943
l used to prepare a pipe for my husband.

1530
02:16:49,243 --> 02:16:53,538
lt was the morphine he took
for the wounds he suffered in his heart.

1531
02:16:57,209 --> 02:17:00,837
He would rage and he would cry,
my lost soldier.

1532
02:17:04,591 --> 02:17:06,259
And l said to him,

1533
02:17:07,011 --> 02:17:10,388
"There are two of you, don't you see?

1534
02:17:11,473 --> 02:17:15,101
"One that kills and one that loves."

1535
02:17:17,229 --> 02:17:18,896
And he said to me,

1536
02:17:19,773 --> 02:17:23,401
"l don't know whether
l am an animal or a god."

1537
02:17:26,864 --> 02:17:28,489
But you are both.

1538
02:18:10,365 --> 02:18:12,116
You want more?

1539
02:18:17,831 --> 02:18:21,667
All that matters is that you are alive.

1540
02:18:23,337 --> 02:18:25,254
You are alive, Captain.

1541
02:18:29,551 --> 02:18:31,177
That's the truth.

1542
02:19:45,085 --> 02:19:48,588
There are two of you, don't you see?

1543
02:19:49,923 --> 02:19:54,093
One that kills and one that loves.

1544
02:20:23,457 --> 02:20:26,000
Can't see nothing. We're stopping.

1545
02:20:26,501 --> 02:20:28,878
You're not authorized
to stop this boat, Chief.

1546
02:20:28,962 --> 02:20:31,797
l said l can't see a thing, Captain.
l'm stopping this boat.

1547
02:20:32,549 --> 02:20:34,133
l ain't risking no more lives.

1548
02:20:34,218 --> 02:20:37,136
l'm in command here, God damn it.
You'll do what l say.

1549
02:20:39,306 --> 02:20:41,474
You see anything, Chef?

1550
02:20:43,477 --> 02:20:45,811
Why don't they fucking attack, man?

1551
02:21:05,040 --> 02:21:07,166
Watch it over here, Chief.

1552
02:21:08,293 --> 02:21:09,961
Got a stump.

1553
02:21:11,380 --> 02:21:12,755
Lance, on the .50s.

1554
02:21:14,549 --> 02:21:16,342
He was close.

1555
02:21:18,387 --> 02:21:20,054
He was real close.

1556
02:21:22,349 --> 02:21:27,228
l couldn't see him yet, but l could feel him,
as if the boat were being sucked upriver

1557
02:21:27,312 --> 02:21:30,189
and the water was flowing back
into the jungle.

1558
02:21:32,734 --> 02:21:35,152
Whatever was going to happen,

1559
02:21:35,237 --> 02:21:39,198
it wasn't gonna be
the way they called it back in Nha Trang.

1560
02:21:43,870 --> 02:21:45,121
Arrows!

1561
02:21:45,205 --> 02:21:46,330
Fire!

1562
02:21:48,542 --> 02:21:49,792
Chef, open up! Fire!

1563
02:21:54,923 --> 02:21:56,882
Lance, fire!

1564
02:22:04,725 --> 02:22:08,019
Chef! Chef, it's okay. Quit firing.

1565
02:22:08,520 --> 02:22:10,104
They're just little toy arrows.

1566
02:22:10,397 --> 02:22:12,315
Cut it out! Quiet!

1567
02:22:12,566 --> 02:22:14,817
Chief, tell them to hold their fire!

1568
02:22:15,235 --> 02:22:17,570
They're just little sticks.
They're just trying to scare us.

1569
02:22:17,988 --> 02:22:19,322
Quiet!

1570
02:22:20,365 --> 02:22:23,159
You got us in this mess,
and now you can't get us out

1571
02:22:23,243 --> 02:22:25,161
because you don't know
where the hell you're going, do you?

1572
02:22:25,746 --> 02:22:26,912
Do you?

1573
02:22:27,914 --> 02:22:30,791
You son of a bitch! You bastard!

1574
02:22:32,419 --> 02:22:34,754
-Lance, get the wheel!
-Fire!

1575
02:22:35,422 --> 02:22:38,966
You savages!
Come and get it, you son of a bitches!

1576
02:22:59,446 --> 02:23:01,113
A spear.

1577
02:24:20,569 --> 02:24:23,404
My mission is to make it up into Cambodia.

1578
02:24:24,030 --> 02:24:26,490
There's a Green Beret colonel up there
who's gone insane

1579
02:24:26,575 --> 02:24:28,451
and l'm supposed to kill him.

1580
02:24:29,870 --> 02:24:32,538
That's fucking typical! Shit!

1581
02:24:32,914 --> 02:24:34,874
Fucking Vietnam mission!

1582
02:24:35,208 --> 02:24:38,961
l'm short and we gotta go up there
so you can kill one of our own guys?

1583
02:24:39,045 --> 02:24:42,882
That's fucking great!
That's just fucking great, man.

1584
02:24:43,633 --> 02:24:46,510
Shit! That's fucking crazy.

1585
02:24:47,095 --> 02:24:50,055
l mean, l thought
you were going in to blow up a bridge

1586
02:24:50,182 --> 02:24:53,058
or some fucking railroad tracks
or something.

1587
02:24:54,060 --> 02:24:56,103
-Sorry.
-No, no, wait, wait.

1588
02:24:56,188 --> 02:24:59,482
We'll go together on the boat.
We'll go with you.

1589
02:24:59,566 --> 02:25:03,235
We'll go up there, but on the boat. Okay?

1590
02:26:10,303 --> 02:26:14,265
Part of me was afraid of what l would find
and what l would do when l got there.

1591
02:26:17,310 --> 02:26:21,772
l knew the risks, or imagined l knew.

1592
02:26:24,317 --> 02:26:28,487
But the thing l felt the most,
much stronger than fear,

1593
02:26:30,115 --> 02:26:32,032
was the desire to confront him.

1594
02:27:44,731 --> 02:27:46,023
Just keep moving.

1595
02:27:46,733 --> 02:27:50,402
Lance, keep your hands
away from the guns.

1596
02:29:17,323 --> 02:29:20,492
lt's all right! lt's all right!
lt's all been approved!

1597
02:29:21,661 --> 02:29:24,913
l ain't coming in there!
Them bastards attacked us!

1598
02:29:26,332 --> 02:29:29,585
Zap them with your siren, man.
Zap them with your siren.

1599
02:29:40,013 --> 02:29:41,847
There's mines over there
and mines over there, too.

1600
02:29:42,015 --> 02:29:44,475
And watch out. Those goddamn monkeys
bite you, l'll tell you.

1601
02:29:45,351 --> 02:29:47,853
That's a pretty one.
Move it right in toward me.

1602
02:29:49,272 --> 02:29:51,190
l'm an American. Yeah.

1603
02:29:51,483 --> 02:29:53,150
An American civilian. Hi, Yanks.

1604
02:29:53,860 --> 02:29:55,360
Hi, American.

1605
02:29:55,862 --> 02:29:57,279
American civilian. lt's all right.

1606
02:29:58,031 --> 02:30:00,949
And you got the cigarettes.
And that's what l've been dreaming about.

1607
02:30:02,118 --> 02:30:03,202
Chef.

1608
02:30:03,953 --> 02:30:06,622
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

1609
02:30:10,919 --> 02:30:12,544
l'm a photojournalist.

1610
02:30:13,213 --> 02:30:15,214
l've covered the war since '64.

1611
02:30:15,590 --> 02:30:18,133
l've been in Laos, Cambodia and Nam.

1612
02:30:22,806 --> 02:30:25,557
l'll tell you one thing,
this boat is a mess, man.

1613
02:30:26,559 --> 02:30:27,893
Who are all these people?

1614
02:30:27,977 --> 02:30:33,065
Yeah, they think you've come
to take him away,

1615
02:30:33,399 --> 02:30:36,276
-and l hope that isn't true.
-Take who away?

1616
02:30:38,571 --> 02:30:41,323
Him! Colonel Kurtz.

1617
02:30:42,367 --> 02:30:45,077
These are all his children, man,
as far as you can see.

1618
02:30:46,371 --> 02:30:48,872
Hell, man, out here, we're all his children.

1619
02:30:49,791 --> 02:30:53,168
Could we talk to Colonel Kurtz?

1620
02:30:53,753 --> 02:30:59,424
Hey, man, you don't talk to the Colonel.
Well, you listen to him.

1621
02:31:00,927 --> 02:31:02,928
The man's enlarged my mind.

1622
02:31:03,805 --> 02:31:07,182
He's a poet warrior in the classic sense.

1623
02:31:07,267 --> 02:31:10,477
Sometimes you'll say hello to him, right,

1624
02:31:10,562 --> 02:31:12,938
and he'll just walk right by you
and he won't even notice you.

1625
02:31:13,022 --> 02:31:16,525
And then suddenly he'll grab you,
he'll throw you in a corner and he'll say,

1626
02:31:16,609 --> 02:31:19,695
"Do you know that 'if' is the middle word
in 'life'? lf you can keep your head

1627
02:31:19,779 --> 02:31:21,572
"when all about you are losing theirs
and blaming it on you,

1628
02:31:21,656 --> 02:31:23,115
"if you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you..."

1629
02:31:24,409 --> 02:31:27,619
l'm a little man. l'm a little man.
He's a great man.

1630
02:31:28,413 --> 02:31:34,167
"l should have been a pair of ragged claws
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas."

1631
02:31:34,252 --> 02:31:35,794
Stay with the boat.

1632
02:31:36,713 --> 02:31:39,590
Don't go without me, okay?
l wanna get a picture.

1633
02:31:42,135 --> 02:31:46,805
He can be terrible, he can be mean,
and he can be right.

1634
02:31:47,807 --> 02:31:50,642
He's fighting the war. He's a great man.

1635
02:31:58,735 --> 02:32:01,945
l wish l had words, you know?
l wish l had words.

1636
02:32:02,363 --> 02:32:04,907
l can tell you something,
like, the other day he wanted to kill me.

1637
02:32:05,533 --> 02:32:07,743
-Something like that.
-Why'd he want to kill you?

1638
02:32:08,244 --> 02:32:09,828
Because l took his picture.

1639
02:32:10,830 --> 02:32:13,123
He said, "lf you take my picture again,

1640
02:32:14,500 --> 02:32:18,128
"l'm gonna kill you," and he meant it.

1641
02:32:20,882 --> 02:32:24,843
So you just lay cool.
Play it cool, laid back. Dig it.

1642
02:32:25,470 --> 02:32:27,179
He gets friendly again. He really does.

1643
02:32:28,806 --> 02:32:31,183
But you don't judge the Colonel.

1644
02:32:32,101 --> 02:32:34,227
You don't judge the Colonel
like an ordinary man.

1645
02:32:41,194 --> 02:32:43,195
Okay, watch it now. These are Americans.

1646
02:32:43,321 --> 02:32:44,321
Americans!

1647
02:32:44,656 --> 02:32:46,156
You can feel the vibe of this place.

1648
02:32:47,158 --> 02:32:50,577
Let me take your picture.
Could you hold... Hello? Hello?

1649
02:32:50,703 --> 02:32:52,204
Could you hold up a minute?

1650
02:33:14,560 --> 02:33:15,727
Colby.

1651
02:33:32,203 --> 02:33:33,286
The heads.

1652
02:33:34,330 --> 02:33:39,543
You're looking at the heads.
Sometimes he goes too far.

1653
02:33:40,420 --> 02:33:42,254
He's the first one to admit it.

1654
02:33:43,381 --> 02:33:45,632
-He's gone crazy.
-Wrong, wrong!

1655
02:33:47,593 --> 02:33:50,554
lf you could have heard the man
just two days ago.

1656
02:33:50,638 --> 02:33:55,100
lf you could have heard him then, God...
You're gonna call him crazy?

1657
02:33:55,768 --> 02:33:57,144
Fucking A.

1658
02:33:58,604 --> 02:34:03,984
-l just wanna talk to him.
-Well, man, he's gone away.

1659
02:34:05,862 --> 02:34:08,280
He's gone away. He disappeared
out in the jungle with his people.

1660
02:34:08,364 --> 02:34:09,364
l'll wait for him.

1661
02:34:09,449 --> 02:34:13,618
He feels comfortable with his people.
He forgets himself with his people.

1662
02:34:16,039 --> 02:34:18,331
-He forgets himself.
-Captain?

1663
02:34:18,958 --> 02:34:23,170
-Maybe we should wait back at the boat.
-Okay, Chef.

1664
02:34:23,796 --> 02:34:28,216
-We'll go back to the boat for a while.
-Yeah, stay with Lance.

1665
02:34:51,866 --> 02:34:56,203
This Colonel guy, he's wacko, man.
He's worse than crazy. He's evil!

1666
02:34:57,663 --> 02:34:59,289
That's what the man's got set up here!

1667
02:34:59,373 --> 02:35:02,459
Man, it's fucking Pagan idolatry.
Look around you!

1668
02:35:03,211 --> 02:35:04,544
Shit, he's loco.

1669
02:35:05,088 --> 02:35:08,090
-Then you'll help me?
-Help you? Fucking A, l'll help you.

1670
02:35:08,174 --> 02:35:09,591
l'll do anything to get out of this joint.

1671
02:35:09,675 --> 02:35:10,717
Good boy.

1672
02:35:11,552 --> 02:35:13,011
We could blow all them assholes away.

1673
02:35:13,096 --> 02:35:15,722
They're so fucking spaced out,
they wouldn't even know it.

1674
02:35:16,641 --> 02:35:21,144
l ain't afraid of all them fucking skulls
and altars and shit.

1675
02:35:23,272 --> 02:35:26,900
l used to think if l died in an evil place,

1676
02:35:27,443 --> 02:35:29,528
then my soul wouldn't be able
to make it to heaven.

1677
02:35:30,488 --> 02:35:33,448
But now, fuck.

1678
02:35:35,660 --> 02:35:37,953
l don't care where it goes,
as long as it ain't here.

1679
02:35:38,538 --> 02:35:41,373
So what do you wanna do? l'll kill the fuck.

1680
02:35:41,457 --> 02:35:43,083
-No, no.
-Get out of here.

1681
02:35:43,334 --> 02:35:44,960
l'm gonna need you to wait here, Chef.

1682
02:35:45,711 --> 02:35:49,256
l'll go up with Lance and scrounge around,
check the place out,

1683
02:35:49,882 --> 02:35:52,050
see if l can find the Colonel, okay?

1684
02:35:54,095 --> 02:35:56,471
-What do you want me to do?
-Damn it.

1685
02:35:57,014 --> 02:36:03,019
Here, you take the radio,
and if l don't get back by 2200 hours,

1686
02:36:05,898 --> 02:36:07,232
you call in the air strike.

1687
02:36:10,027 --> 02:36:11,403
Air strike?

1688
02:36:13,156 --> 02:36:17,826
The code is "Almighty,"
coordinates 0-9-2-6-4-7-1 -2.

1689
02:36:18,744 --> 02:36:20,078
lt's all in there.

1690
02:36:21,747 --> 02:36:24,374
0-9-2-6-4-7-1 -2.

1691
02:36:33,259 --> 02:36:36,595
Everything l saw told me that Kurtz
had gone insane.

1692
02:36:40,975 --> 02:36:46,646
The place was full of bodies.
North Vietnamese, Viet Cong, Cambodians.

1693
02:36:54,322 --> 02:36:57,324
If I was stiII aIive,
it was because he wanted me that way.

1694
02:37:31,776 --> 02:37:34,194
lt smelled like slow death in there.

1695
02:37:35,780 --> 02:37:39,032
Malaria, nightmares.

1696
02:37:41,827 --> 02:37:43,870
This was the end of the river, all right.

1697
02:37:58,177 --> 02:37:59,594
Where are you from, Willard?

1698
02:38:05,184 --> 02:38:06,768
l'm from Ohio, sir.

1699
02:38:12,733 --> 02:38:15,360
-Were you born there?
-Yes, sir.

1700
02:38:17,530 --> 02:38:20,198
-Whereabouts?
-Toledo, sir.

1701
02:38:27,540 --> 02:38:29,332
How far are you from the river?

1702
02:38:36,299 --> 02:38:38,008
The Ohio River, sir?

1703
02:38:40,553 --> 02:38:42,220
About 200 miles.

1704
02:38:50,229 --> 02:38:53,189
l went down that river once
when l was a kid.

1705
02:38:58,070 --> 02:39:00,780
There's a place in the river,
l can't remember.

1706
02:39:01,157 --> 02:39:06,077
lt must've been a gardenia plantation
or a flower plantation at one time.

1707
02:39:06,412 --> 02:39:09,164
lt's all wild and overgrown now,

1708
02:39:09,248 --> 02:39:15,754
but for about five miles, you'd think that
heaven just fell on the Earth,

1709
02:39:17,173 --> 02:39:19,132
in the form of gardenias.

1710
02:39:35,441 --> 02:39:40,487
Have you ever considered
any real freedoms?

1711
02:39:46,285 --> 02:39:49,204
Freedoms from the opinion of others?

1712
02:39:52,750 --> 02:39:54,709
Even the opinions of yourself?

1713
02:40:10,893 --> 02:40:14,479
Did they say why, Willard?

1714
02:40:16,732 --> 02:40:21,444
Why they wanted
to terminate my command?

1715
02:40:37,086 --> 02:40:39,295
l was sent on a classified mission, sir.

1716
02:40:43,509 --> 02:40:47,011
No longer classified, is it?

1717
02:40:54,353 --> 02:40:55,770
What did they tell you?

1718
02:40:58,774 --> 02:41:05,071
They told me that you had gone
totally insane,

1719
02:41:08,033 --> 02:41:14,372
and that your methods were unsound.

1720
02:41:18,210 --> 02:41:20,128
Are my methods unsound?

1721
02:41:26,218 --> 02:41:32,390
l don't see any method at all, sir.

1722
02:41:39,482 --> 02:41:43,109
l expected someone like you.

1723
02:41:46,489 --> 02:41:47,739
What did you expect?

1724
02:41:55,998 --> 02:41:57,582
Are you an assassin?

1725
02:42:02,463 --> 02:42:03,630
l'm a soldier.

1726
02:42:07,510 --> 02:42:09,093
You're neither.

1727
02:42:11,263 --> 02:42:15,850
You're an errand boy sent by grocery clerks

1728
02:42:20,606 --> 02:42:22,273
to collect a bill.

1729
02:43:06,235 --> 02:43:11,864
Why? Why would a nice guy like you
wanna kill a genius?

1730
02:43:18,831 --> 02:43:20,582
Going down pretty good, huh?

1731
02:43:21,208 --> 02:43:22,292
Why?

1732
02:43:24,003 --> 02:43:25,670
You know?

1733
02:43:26,463 --> 02:43:28,506
Do you know that the man,

1734
02:43:32,011 --> 02:43:34,012
the man really likes you?

1735
02:43:37,308 --> 02:43:43,187
He likes you. He really likes you,
but he's got something in mind for you.

1736
02:43:44,857 --> 02:43:46,441
Aren't you curious about that?

1737
02:43:47,026 --> 02:43:52,488
l'm curious. l'm very curious.
Are you curious?

1738
02:43:55,993 --> 02:43:58,786
There's something
happening out here, man.

1739
02:44:02,207 --> 02:44:04,709
You know something, man?
l know something that you don't know.

1740
02:44:05,210 --> 02:44:06,628
That's right, jack.

1741
02:44:06,920 --> 02:44:12,300
The man is clear in his mind,
but his soul is mad.

1742
02:44:14,261 --> 02:44:15,553
Yeah.

1743
02:44:16,680 --> 02:44:20,683
He's dying, l think.
He hates all this. He hates it.

1744
02:44:21,769 --> 02:44:25,647
But the man's...

1745
02:44:29,151 --> 02:44:31,653
He reads poetry out loud, all right?

1746
02:44:33,572 --> 02:44:37,241
And a voice, a voice...

1747
02:44:40,579 --> 02:44:44,916
He likes you 'cause you're still alive.
He's got plans for you.

1748
02:44:45,334 --> 02:44:49,962
No, no, l'm not gonna help you.
You're gonna help him, man.

1749
02:44:50,923 --> 02:44:52,382
You're gonna help him.

1750
02:44:52,758 --> 02:44:55,176
What are they gonna say, man,
when he's gone?

1751
02:44:55,302 --> 02:44:59,931
'Cause he dies when it dies, man.
When it dies, he dies.

1752
02:45:00,057 --> 02:45:01,099
What are they gonna say about him?

1753
02:45:01,183 --> 02:45:05,645
What are they gonna say?
"He was a kind man. He was a wise man.

1754
02:45:05,896 --> 02:45:09,357
"He had plans. He had wisdom."
Bullshit, man!

1755
02:45:09,775 --> 02:45:13,820
Am l gonna be the one that's gonna
set them straight? Look at me. Wrong!

1756
02:45:17,616 --> 02:45:18,700
You.

1757
02:45:24,039 --> 02:45:25,957
Almost eight hours.

1758
02:45:28,502 --> 02:45:31,963
God. l'm asleep.

1759
02:45:33,882 --> 02:45:36,634
l'm asleep and dreaming
l'm on this shitty boat.

1760
02:45:48,731 --> 02:45:49,814
Fuck.

1761
02:45:54,153 --> 02:45:55,737

This is dialectics. lt's very simple dialectics.
One through nine,

1809
02:56:19,277 --> 02:56:22,654
no "maybes," no "supposes," no fractions.
You can't travel in space.

1810
02:56:22,739 --> 02:56:27,117
You can't go out into space, you know,
without like... With fractions.

1811
02:56:27,202 --> 02:56:29,036
What are you gonna land on?
One-quarter? Three-eighths?

1812
02:56:29,120 --> 02:56:31,747
What are you gonna do when you go
from here to Venus or something?

1813
02:56:31,956 --> 02:56:33,874
That's dialectic physics, okay?

1814
02:56:33,958 --> 02:56:36,043
Dialectic logic is,
"There's only love and hate."

1815
02:56:36,127 --> 02:56:38,170
You either love somebody
or you hate them.

1816
02:56:38,630 --> 02:56:39,713

This is the way the fucking world ends.
Look at this fucking shit we're in, man!

1819
02:56:49,891 --> 02:56:51,892
"Not with a bang, a whimper."

1820
02:56:51,976 --> 02:56:54,311
And with a whimper,
l'm fucking splitting, jack.

On the river, l thought
that the minute I Iooked at him,

1822
02:57:26,970 --> 02:57:28,720
l'd know what to do.

1823
02:57:29,681 --> 02:57:36,353
But it didn't happen. l was in there
with him for days, not under guard.

1824
02:57:37,355 --> 02:57:41,525
l was free.
But he knew l wasn't going anywhere.

1825
02:57:42,986 --> 02:57:46,280
He knew more
about what l was going to do than l did.

1826
02:57:53,371 --> 02:57:56,874
lf the generals back in Nha Trang
couId see what I saw,

1827
02:57:57,834 --> 02:58:00,419
would they still want me to kill him?

1828
02:58:01,671 --> 02:58:03,547
More than ever, probably.

1829
02:58:05,008 --> 02:58:06,925
And what would his people
back home want,

1830
02:58:07,010 --> 02:58:10,053
if they ever learned
just how far from them he'd really gone?

1831
02:58:12,640 --> 02:58:16,059
He broke from them,
and then he broke from himself.

1832
02:58:17,729 --> 02:58:21,899
l'd never seen a man so broken up
and ripped apart.

1833
02:58:22,901 --> 02:58:27,029
l've seen the horrors,
horrors that you've seen.

1834
02:58:29,699 --> 02:58:33,619
But you have no right to call me a murderer.
You have a right to kill me.

1835
02:58:34,954 --> 02:58:40,918
You have a right to do that.
But you have no right to judge me.

1836
02:58:48,259 --> 02:58:53,263
lt's impossible for words to describe

1837
02:58:55,600 --> 02:59:01,563
what is necessary to those

1838
02:59:03,274 --> 02:59:08,946
who do not know what horror means.

1839
02:59:11,407 --> 02:59:12,616
Horror.

1840
02:59:15,620 --> 02:59:18,247
Horror has a face.

1841
02:59:20,541 --> 02:59:22,668
And you must make a friend of horror.

1842
02:59:24,379 --> 02:59:29,216
Horror and moral terror are your friends.

1843
02:59:29,801 --> 02:59:34,596
lf they are not,
then they are enemies to be feared.

1844
02:59:36,099 --> 02:59:37,975
They are truly enemies.

1845
02:59:42,981 --> 02:59:45,816
l remember when l was with Special Forces.

1846
02:59:50,321 --> 02:59:54,241
lt seems a thousand centuries ago.

1847
02:59:57,829 --> 03:00:03,667
We went into a camp
to inoculate some children.

1848
03:00:08,256 --> 03:00:13,802
We'd left the camp after we had
inoculated the children for polio.

1849
03:00:16,264 --> 03:00:19,641
And this old man came running after us,
and he was crying, he couldn't see.

1850
03:00:23,229 --> 03:00:25,772
We went back there

1851
03:00:25,857 --> 03:00:31,320
and they had come
and hacked off every inoculated arm.

1852
03:00:33,698 --> 03:00:40,495
There they were, in a pile.
A pile of little arms.

1853
03:00:42,623 --> 03:00:44,875
And l remember,

1854
03:00:48,755 --> 03:00:51,548
l cried. l wept like

1855
03:00:53,718 --> 03:00:56,386
some grandmother.

1856
03:00:58,556 --> 03:01:01,808
l wanted to tear my teeth out.
l didn't know what l wanted to do.

1857
03:01:03,561 --> 03:01:05,812
And l want to remember it.
l never want to forget it.

1858
03:01:06,689 --> 03:01:08,523
l never want to forget.

1859
03:01:10,193 --> 03:01:14,905
And then l realized, like l was shot,

1860
03:01:15,406 --> 03:01:17,574
like l was shot with a diamond,

1861
03:01:18,785 --> 03:01:21,912
a diamond bullet
right through my forehead.

1862
03:01:23,998 --> 03:01:29,169
And l thought,
"My God, the genius of that. The genius."

1863
03:01:30,588 --> 03:01:32,964
The will to do that,

1864
03:01:34,634 --> 03:01:39,096
perfect, genuine, complete,
crystalline, pure.

1865
03:01:41,682 --> 03:01:43,600
And then l realized

1866
03:01:43,684 --> 03:01:47,270
they were stronger than me
because they could stand it.

1867
03:01:47,355 --> 03:01:51,316
These were not monsters.
These were men, trained cadres.

1868
03:01:52,777 --> 03:01:57,447
These men who fought with their hearts,
who have families, who have children,

1869
03:01:57,532 --> 03:02:01,368
who are filled with love,
but they have the strength,

1870
03:02:03,121 --> 03:02:09,584
the strength to do that.

1871
03:02:10,670 --> 03:02:14,965
lf l had 1 0 divisions of those men,

1872
03:02:16,050 --> 03:02:19,010
then our troubles here
would be over very quickly.

1873
03:02:20,805 --> 03:02:25,225
You have to have men who are moral,

1874
03:02:27,562 --> 03:02:31,606
and at the same time, who are able

1875
03:02:33,234 --> 03:02:39,489
to utilize their primordial instincts to kill

1876
03:02:41,409 --> 03:02:47,998
without feeling, without passion,
without judgment. Without judgment.

1877
03:02:53,504 --> 03:02:56,131
Because it's judgment that defeats us.

1878
03:03:15,610 --> 03:03:22,407
l worry that my son
might not understand what l've tried to be.

1879
03:03:25,119 --> 03:03:29,748
And if l were to be killed, Willard,

1880
03:03:31,292 --> 03:03:36,755
l would want someone to go to my home
and tell my son everything.

1881
03:03:40,051 --> 03:03:43,053
Everything l did. Everything you saw.

1882
03:03:44,805 --> 03:03:50,310
Because there's nothing that l detest more
than the stench of lies.

1883
03:03:53,397 --> 03:04:00,403
And if you understand me, Willard,
you will do this for me.

1884
03:05:06,929 --> 03:05:09,097
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty. Over.

1885
03:05:10,891 --> 03:05:14,019
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Standing by. Over.

1886
03:05:16,272 --> 03:05:20,150
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Standing by. How do you copy?

1887
03:05:25,489 --> 03:05:28,283
They were gonna make me a Major for this,

1888
03:05:29,035 --> 03:05:32,162
and l wasn't even
in their fucking Army anymore.

1889
03:05:34,332 --> 03:05:39,044
Everybody wanted me to do it,
him most of all.

1890
03:05:41,005 --> 03:05:45,383
l felt like he was up there,
waiting for me to take the pain away.

1891
03:05:48,721 --> 03:05:52,807
He just wanted to go out like a soldier.
Standing up.

1892
03:05:54,143 --> 03:05:57,729
Not like some poor, wasted,
rag-assed renegade.

1893
03:06:01,609 --> 03:06:03,902
Even the jungle wanted him dead,

1894
03:06:04,862 --> 03:06:07,530
and that's who he really
took his orders from anyway.

1895
03:07:24,859 --> 03:07:30,071
"We train young men to drop fire on people,
but their commanders

1896
03:07:31,282 --> 03:07:36,202
"won't allow them to write 'Fuck'
on their airplanes

1897
03:07:36,287 --> 03:07:39,289
"because it's obscene!"

1898
03:09:02,498 --> 03:09:09,462
The horror.

1899
03:14:32,494 --> 03:14:37,582
Calling PBR Street Gang.
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.

1900
03:14:37,666 --> 03:14:39,500
Do you read me? Over.

1901
03:14:40,377 --> 03:14:41,961
PBR Street Gang.

1902
03:14:42,588 --> 03:14:44,672
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty...

1903
03:15:22,920 --> 03:15:30,134
The horror.

1904
03:15:33,134 --> 03:15:37,134
