<i>ANNA: When I was a kid, my mother told me
that I was a little piece of blue sky...</i>

2
00:00:48,064 --> 00:00:52,728
<i>...that came into this world
because she and Dad loved me so much.</i>

3
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:58,734
<i>It was only later that I realized
that it wasn't exactly true.</i>

4
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:06,238
<i>Most babies are coincidences.</i>

5
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:09,317
<i>I mean, up in space
you got all these souls flying around...</i>

6
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,511
<i>...looking for bodies to live in.</i>

7
00:01:11,688 --> 00:01:15,351
<i>Then, down here on Earth,
two people have sex or whatever...</i>

8
00:01:15,525 --> 00:01:18,619
<i>...and bam, coincidence.</i>

9
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:27,599
<i>Sure, you hear all these stories about
how everyone plans these perfect families...</i>

10
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:29,602
<i>...but the truth is that most babies...</i>

11
00:01:29,773 --> 00:01:33,402
<i>...are products of drunken evenings
and lack of birth control.</i>

12
00:01:35,378 --> 00:01:37,278
<i>They're accidents.</i>

13
00:01:37,647 --> 00:01:42,243
<i>Only people who have trouble
making babies actually plan for them.</i>

14
00:01:49,058 --> 00:01:52,926
<i>I, on the other hand,
am not a coincidence.</i>

15
00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:57,032
<i>I was engineered.</i>

16
00:01:57,467 --> 00:02:00,095
<i>Born for a particular reason.</i>

17
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,838
<i>A scientist hooked up my mother's eggs
and my father's sperm...</i>

18
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:09,342
<i>...to make a specific
combination of genes.</i>

19

<i>He did it to save my sister's life.</i>

20
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:22,224
<i>Sometimes I wonder what would have
happened if Kate had been healthy.</i>

21
00:02:23,526 --> 00:02:25,858
<i>I'd probably still be up in heaven
or wherever...</i>

22
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:29,465
<i>...waiting to be attached to a body
down here on Earth.</i>

23
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,793
<i>But coincidence or not...</i>

24
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:36,365
<i>...I'm here.</i>

25
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,074
What can I do for you?

26
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:52,811
Fourteen karat gold, hardly ever worn.

27
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,994
<i>That's my sister, Kate.</i>

28

<i>She's dying.</i>

29
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:04,765
ANNA:
Montana? I don't get it.

30
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,965
- It looks like a whole bunch of nothing.
KATE: It is a whole bunch of nothing.

31
00:03:09,138 --> 00:03:12,039
- Just you and the big old sky.
- Why do you like it?

32
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:15,939
I don't know. I like big things.
I like wide-open spaces.

33
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:19,871
Besides,
it's the only place I've ever been.

<i>That's Mom and Aunt Kelly
making dinner.</i>

35
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,423
<i>Since my sister got sick,
things have changed.</i>

36
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,686
<i>Aunt Kelly only works part-time
and Mom quit her job as a lawyer.</i>

37
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:34,523
<i>Her life now revolves around
keeping Kate alive.</i>

38
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:36,187
<i>Cooking and cleaning.</i>

39
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:38,960
<i>Everything steamed,
organic and germ-free.</i>

40
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,727
- Have a good night.
- Bye.

41
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:43,498
<i>I guess you could say
that we're a little dysfunctional.</i>

42
00:03:43,673 --> 00:03:46,369
<i>But everybody loves each other,
and we do the best we can.</i>

43
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:48,635
- That's not a word.
BRIAN: What about that language?

44
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,836
- Nice shirt, sissy.
- Good, right?

45
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:53,414
- Hey, Mom, you wanna see our routine?
- What routine?

46
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,245
- Come on, Anna, let's do it.
- Hey, baby, what's your sign?

47
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:57,579
- Cancer.
- You're a Cancer?

48
00:03:57,754 --> 00:03:59,779
- No, I'm a Leo...
KATE & BRIAN: But I have cancer.

49
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:01,548
- It's not even funny.
- Yes, it is.

50
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:04,716
JESSE: I agree with Dad.
- It was pretty clever.

51
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:05,952
- Boo.
GIRLS: Boo.

52
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:07,994
JESSE:
It's not funny. It's not.

53
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,825
Nice. Nice. These your kids?

54
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,229
Yes, they are.
Question is, are they yours?

55
00:04:12,402 --> 00:04:14,962
You believe that?
Hey, sweetie, where's your locket?

56
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:17,003
Oh, I didn't feel like wearing it today.

57
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,936
- Eat, Kate.
- I'm eating.

58
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:21,668
SARA: Is it not good?
- It's really good, Mom.

59
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:22,936
BRIAN:
It's good to me.

60
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:25,205
I have lentils in the fridge
if you want some.

61
00:04:25,381 --> 00:04:26,780
I'm fine, Mom.

62
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,748
- You're not hungry?
- I bet she needs to breathe a little bit.

63
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,150
- Maybe you should try to breathe a bit.
- Maybe I will a bit later.

64
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:34,654
Gross.

65
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:37,349
- Where are you going?
KATE: Bathroom, wanna come?

66
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:40,753
SARA:
Will you breathe on me later?

67
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:11,151
<i>BRIAN: Having a child who is sick
is a full-time occupation.</i>

68

<i>Sure, we still enjoy the usual
day-to-day happinesses of family life.</i>

She's been in renal failure

Her white blood count is very low.

153
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:34,139
She's also presenting with
12% promyelocytes and 5% blasts...

154
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,074
...which does indicate
a leukemic syndrome.

155
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:38,481
Leukemic?

156
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:40,115
Cancer.

157
00:10:41,324 --> 00:10:43,519
I'll need a bone marrow
aspiration to confirm...

158
00:10:43,693 --> 00:10:48,096
...but it seems that Kate could have what
is called acute promyelocytic leukemia.

159
00:10:49,465 --> 00:10:51,126
I'm sorry.

160
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,563
MAN:
Respiration's normal.

161
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:18,024
<i>BRIAN:
St. Joe's doesn't know shit.</i>

162
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:24,195
You remember when the chief's son was
playing with Jesse and broke his left arm?

163
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:26,358
They put a cast on his right.

164
00:11:32,742 --> 00:11:35,074
I'm not gonna let her die.

165
00:11:36,178 --> 00:11:38,146
You know that, right?

166
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,813
I'm not.

167
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,504
Hello?

168
00:12:12,681 --> 00:12:13,875
KELLY:
We heard her coughing...

169
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:16,279
...but she wouldn't
open the door. Your mom kicked it in.

170
00:12:16,452 --> 00:12:17,714
JESSE: Kicked the door down?
KELLY: Yeah.

171
00:12:17,887 --> 00:12:20,856
SARA: I haven't gotten in touch with them,
she's lost a lot of blood.

172
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:23,082
We need to get
platelets and fluids into her.

173
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:25,819
- I don't want her going into shock.
EMT 1: Her age and weight?

174
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,658
SARA: Fifteen, she's about 90 pounds,
she's allergic to penicillin.

175
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,231
EMT 2:
One-hundred over 68.

176
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,765
EMT 1:
Okay, Base Camp, Rescue 11.

177
00:12:32,935 --> 00:12:35,096
We have a 15-year-old girl,
approximately 90 pounds.

178
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:38,331
- BP is 100 over 68.
- Jesus Christ.

179
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,443
EMT 2:
All right, let's get her up. Yeah.

180
00:12:46,482 --> 00:12:48,074
There you go.

181
00:12:53,422 --> 00:12:55,754
We're just gonna bring you downstairs.

182
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:04,395
<i>JESSE:
Nobody's saying anything...</i>

183
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:08,401
<i>...but seeing everybody together
lets me know that this is serious.</i>

184
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:12,402
<i>Our family is kind of disconnected.</i>

185
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:17,010
<i>Dad's relatives are wealthy and distant,
and Mom's side drives her crazy.</i>

186
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:18,441
<i>So besides Aunt Kelly...</i>

187
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:23,142
<i>...we never really get to see anybody
except on holidays or disasters.</i>

188
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,547
<i>NGUYEN:
Kate's leukemia is back.</i>

189
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:31,721
She's no longer remissing.

190
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,455
CHANCE: We've looked at her smear,
and her leukemic cells are showing at 23%.

191
00:13:35,631 --> 00:13:38,099
- How many is bad?
- Any.

192
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:39,291
TOMMY:
What about chemo?

193
00:13:39,468 --> 00:13:42,164
NGUYEN: It's an option,
but Kate doesn't seem to take it very well.

194
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:44,670
And her cancer may be too far along.

195
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,603
So you need more bone marrow?

196
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:50,074
Yes, but the leukemia
isn't Kate's biggest problem now.

197
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,441
She's lost the function of her kidneys.

198
00:13:53,315 --> 00:13:54,441
They've quit.

199
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:56,844
They're gone.

200
00:13:59,221 --> 00:14:01,155
SARA: Not a match?
CHANCE: No.

201
00:14:01,323 --> 00:14:03,757
We're her parents, don't we have to be?

202
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,760
Everyone inherits two sets
of chromosomes containing HLA genes.

203
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,797
Unfortunately,
there's only a 1 in 200 chance...

204
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:15,665
...that parents and their children will be
perfect histocompatible HLA matches.

205
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,663
What about Jesse?

206
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,998
I'm afraid not.

207
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:24,812
It's possible that a donor will crop up
on the national bone-marrow registry.

208
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,643
I thought you said getting a transplant
from an unrelated donor was dangerous.

209
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:29,841
I did.

210
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:33,648
But Kate's situation is time-sensitive,
and sometimes that's all we've got.

211
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:39,354
I'd like to suggest something
completely off the record.

212
00:14:39,995 --> 00:14:43,226
Many times one sibling isn't a match,
but another is.

213
00:14:44,099 --> 00:14:46,363
Have you considered
having another child?

214
00:14:46,535 --> 00:14:48,526
Not to be forward...

215
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:53,141
...but umbilical blood can be an incredibly
effective tool in treating leukemic patients.

216
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:55,237
It's like a miracle.

217
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:58,209
Well, how would you know
that the new child would be a match?

218
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,940
- We could make sure of it.
- In a test tube?

219
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:05,815
Yes. With preimplantation genetic diagnosis,
it would be a 100 percent match.

220
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,721
A donor child?

221
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:10,854
It's not for everybody.

222
00:15:11,026 --> 00:15:13,551
And legally,
I can't even officially recommend it.

223
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:17,062
But like I said,
cord blood would be invaluable.

224
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:19,223
Well, we gotta do it.

225
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:22,704
We gotta try.

226
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:25,071
<i>JESSE:
That was it.</i>

227
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:28,433

228

00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:57,277
<i>Have we forced her
into helping her sister?</i>

303
00:19:58,714 --> 00:20:03,413
<i>All those little encouragements
and rewards, were they real?</i>

304
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:06,520
<i>Or did we just want what we wanted?</i>

305
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:10,085
<i>She was so little when all this started.</i>

306
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:14,395
<i>When did she start
wanting to make her own decisions?</i>

307
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:16,296
<i>BRIAN: It's okay.
YOUNG ANNA: I want my daddy.</i>

308
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,730
- I want my mama! No, please! Mama!
BRIAN: It's okay. I know.

309
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:21,802
YOUNG ANNA:
Mommy!

310
00:20:27,943 --> 00:20:30,309
<i>BRIAN:
I guess the answer is now.</i>

311
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,048
SARA:
What do you mean, you don't know?

312
00:20:35,217 --> 00:20:37,185
BRIAN:
She won't talk.

313
00:20:39,054 --> 00:20:41,488
You know,
maybe she just wants to be considered.

314
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,093
Take the credit that it's her decision,
I don't know.

315
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,922
- Maybe it's not crazy.
SARA: What, you don't want her to do it?

316
00:20:48,096 --> 00:20:49,120
I didn't say that.

317
00:20:49,298 --> 00:20:51,994
But it's against her will,
so how does that work?

318
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,499
- Do you hold her down, or do I?
SARA: Don't be dramatic.

319
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,865
You gonna take her ankles,
I'll take her wrists?

320
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,065
- She's not a baby. You just
can't trick her. - I know.

321
00:21:00,242 --> 00:21:01,607
So then what?

322
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,973
- I don't know.
- You want to sedate her?

323
00:21:04,146 --> 00:21:06,842
Get handcuffs, tell her
we're going to get ice cream again?

324
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,711
Because if we do,
every day for the rest of her life...

325
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:13,685
...she's gonna look at us
like we forced her, like we used her.

326
00:21:13,956 --> 00:21:16,948
- And she'll be right.
- For chrissakes, Brian, I didn't do this.

327
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:21,687
- Whose side are you on?
- Side. What sides? Are there sides now?

328
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:25,058
She doesn't want to do it.

329
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,862
<i>GLORIA:
Your 11:00 appointment is here.</i>

330
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,474
- I don't have an 11:00.
GLORIA: Wait, you can't go in there.

331
00:21:34,643 --> 00:21:35,735
Get your hands off me.

332
00:21:35,911 --> 00:21:39,176
Mr. Alexander,
I'm Sara Fitzgerald, Anna's mother.

333
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,475
- It's okay, Gloria. - Are you sure?
I don't mind calling security.

334
00:21:42,651 --> 00:21:43,811
CAMPBELL:
No, no. Thank you.

335
00:21:44,653 --> 00:21:46,484
What can I do for you, Mrs. Fitzgerald?

336
00:21:46,655 --> 00:21:50,113
The legal age for emancipation of a minor
is 14 in the state of California.

337
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:53,955
It's the law, you might want to check it.
Anna's 11, you're three years early.

338
00:21:54,129 --> 00:21:56,222
- I'm aware, she's challenging.
- She can't.

339
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,526
<i>- She's too young to stand.
- I'm filing for her as guardian ad litem.</i>

340
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:01,566
As what? A family independence agency?

341
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,604
I have 15 years as a volunteer member
of the ACLU...

342
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:09,710
...in addition to which I have this power
of attorney signed by your daughter.

343
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,741
This will never hold up.
It's not even legal.

344
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,446
Anna doesn't want to do it anymore.
And 11 years old or not, she has rights.

345
00:22:21,623 --> 00:22:24,820
And so long as she wants to move forward,
I am going to help her.

346
00:22:24,993 --> 00:22:27,723
Why? What's your interest?
This isn't a case for you.

347
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:29,659
- There's no money.
- What's my interest?

348
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:32,265
Eight hospitalizations in 11 years...

349
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,801
...six catheterizations,
two bone-marrow aspirations...

350
00:22:35,971 --> 00:22:38,439
...two stem-cell purges.
- She was helping her sister.

351
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:42,168
Not to mention the side effects,
including bleeding, infections, bruising.

352
00:22:42,344 --> 00:22:45,006
Filgrastim shots.
Those are growth hormones, am I correct?

353
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,081
- Something like that.
- Drugs for nausea, opiates for pain...

354
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,447
...Ambien for sleep. Not exactly
the proper medication for a preteen.

355
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,282
Every procedure
had its risks and complications.

356
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,924
Anna understood that,
she was okay with it.

357
00:22:57,092 --> 00:22:58,491
- Really?
- Yeah.

358
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,491
At 5 years old.

359
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,931
Oh, my God, you're good.
You're really good.

360
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,035
You know, I've seen your commercials,
right? I mean, who hasn't?

361
00:23:08,203 --> 00:23:10,728
I always thought you were
some headline-seeking hack...

362
00:23:10,906 --> 00:23:12,498
...but you have real talent.

363
00:23:12,674 --> 00:23:15,404
You almost had me believing
that you cared about Anna.

364
00:23:15,577 --> 00:23:18,478
Funny, I was about to say
the same thing to you.

365
00:23:21,016 --> 00:23:23,541
Mrs. Fitzgerald,
did you ever say to yourself:

366
00:23:23,718 --> 00:23:26,551
"Maybe I'm wrong,
maybe I took it a little too far?"

367
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:29,581
I'll see you in court.

368
00:23:31,793 --> 00:23:33,317
<i>SARA:
You gotta get up.</i>

369
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,588
You haven't been out of that bed
in two weeks.

370
00:23:35,764 --> 00:23:37,732
KATE: I'm tired.
- You can do it.

371
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:39,890
BRIAN: It's a beautiful day outside.
KATE: No.

372
00:23:40,068 --> 00:23:41,899
It's sunny. It's gonna be good for you.

373
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,265
KATE: I'm too sick.
SARA: You're not too sick.

374
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:47,135
You're depressed.
I'm not gonna feed you antidepressants...

375
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:49,903
...they're gonna just make you more numb.
Now, get up.

376
00:23:50,078 --> 00:23:51,739
- No!
BRIAN: Hey, baby?

377
00:23:51,913 --> 00:23:55,849
- You want to tell me what's really wrong?
- I'm tired. Don't you get that?

378
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,747
- I'm sick, and I'm tired, and I'm ugly.
BRIAN: Stop it.

379
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,946
KATE: Don't you dare tell me
that I'm beautiful, because I'm not.

380
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:05,882
Don't you dare tell me that nobody's
gonna stare at me, because they will.

381
00:24:06,061 --> 00:24:08,120
SARA: Oh, God.
- I'm a freak.

382
00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:09,524
BRIAN:
Come here.

383
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,996
- Okay, that's it.
BRIAN: It's okay.

384
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,968
[RAZOR BUZZING]

385
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,373
Mom?

386
00:24:37,425 --> 00:24:39,655
<i>- [MOUTHING] Thanks, Mom.
- [MOUTHING] Mom, Mom.</i>

387
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,982
<i>KATE:
This is it.</i>

388
00:25:39,821 --> 00:25:42,312
<i>I know I'm going to die now.</i>

389
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,623
<i>I suppose I've always known that.</i>

390
00:25:50,832 --> 00:25:53,130
<i>I just never knew when.</i>

391
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:02,703
<i>And I'm okay with it. Really.</i>

392
00:26:03,745 --> 00:26:06,714
<i>I don't mind my disease killing me.</i>

393
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,743
<i>But it's killing my family too.</i>

394
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:20,456
<i>While everyone was so worried
about my blood counts...</i>

395
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:24,326
<i>...they barely even noticed
that Jesse was dyslexic.</i>

396
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:29,659
Look at this place.
You see all these kids around here?

397
00:26:29,904 --> 00:26:34,807
They got a football team,
this Olympic-style swimming pool.

398
00:26:34,976 --> 00:26:38,002
- Horses.
- They got horses.

399
00:26:38,713 --> 00:26:41,944
Massive playground here.
Look at that Tarzan rope into a lake.

400
00:26:42,117 --> 00:26:45,416
There's kids everywhere.
You're gonna have a great time there.

401
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:48,021
What?

402
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:52,426
Come on, you know this is gonna be
like a vacation for you.

403
00:26:53,094 --> 00:26:55,392
I'll try harder.

404
00:26:56,097 --> 00:26:58,031
It's not about that.

405
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,461
Hey, look at me.

406
00:27:02,237 --> 00:27:06,105
You know how sometimes when you
see things, they are a little mixed up?

407
00:27:06,274 --> 00:27:08,902
This place is special because
they have teachers there...

408
00:27:09,077 --> 00:27:13,377
...that will show you
how to straighten it out.

409
00:27:14,082 --> 00:27:16,550
- Okay.
- And I can't do that.

410
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,742
Okay.

411
00:27:18,353 --> 00:27:20,981
You're gonna get so good at math.

412
00:27:21,156 --> 00:27:24,648
- It's gonna be a year, that's it,
all right? - Just till your grades are up.

413
00:27:26,027 --> 00:27:28,359
If you don't like it, you come right home.

414
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,594
- Okay.
- All right.

415
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,332
<i>KATE:
I'm sorry, Jesse.</i>

416
00:27:42,043 --> 00:27:46,412
<i>I'm sorry I took all the attention when
you were the one who needed it the most.</i>

417
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,860
<i>Dad,
I know I took your first love from you.</i>

418
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:08,400
<i>I only hope that one day,
you get her back.</i>

419
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,177
<i>Mom, you gave up everything for me.</i>

420
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:23,181
<i>Your work, your marriage,
your entire life...</i>

421
00:28:23,351 --> 00:28:26,149
<i>...just to fight my battles for me
every single day.</i>

422
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:32,090
<i>I'm sorry you couldn't win.</i>

423
00:28:34,863 --> 00:28:38,924
<i>And to my baby sis,
who was always so very little...</i>

424
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:44,229
<i>...I'm sorry I let them hurt you.</i>

425
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:49,341
<i>I'm sorry I didn't take care of you.</i>

426
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:53,504
<i>It was supposed to be
the other way around.</i>

427
00:28:55,517 --> 00:28:57,985
- Hey.
- Hi.

428
00:28:59,721 --> 00:29:00,813
I got you something.

429
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,562
- Is that me?
- Mm-hm.

430
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,125
I'm not done with it, but...

431
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,106
- De Salvo? I thought she was on leave.
- She was, she's back.

432
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:32,344
Your Honor, clearly Miss Morangez
is afraid for her life.

433
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,081
At this time, the plaintiff requests
a continuation on the restraining order.

434
00:29:36,257 --> 00:29:38,054
BAILIFF:
Stand, please.

435
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,559
DE SALVO:
Mr. Morangez, by order of this court...

436
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:47,292
...you are no longer allowed
within 1000 yards...

437
00:29:47,902 --> 00:29:50,666
...of Mrs. Morangez or her residence.

438
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:53,467
You understand
how far a thousand yards is?

439
00:29:53,641 --> 00:29:56,166
<i>CAMPBELL: Judge De Salvo
had a very public nervous breakdown...</i>

440
00:29:56,344 --> 00:30:00,542
<i>...after her 12-year-old daughter
was killed by a drunk driver.</i>

441
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:04,151
<i>She had taken a six-month leave of absence
to deal with her grief...</i>

442
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:07,345
<i>...and this was the first time
I'd seen her back in court.</i>

443
00:30:07,522 --> 00:30:09,149
DE SALVO:
You're going to jail.

444
00:30:09,324 --> 00:30:12,054
- Okay, next case, please.
MAN: Thank you, Your Honor.

445
00:30:13,461 --> 00:30:14,951
BAILIFF:
Four-eight-five-seven-two.

446
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:18,331
I'd like to see counsel in my chambers,
please.

447
00:30:23,104 --> 00:30:25,698
DE SALVO: Good afternoon.
SARA: Good afternoon.

448
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,439
What's with the dog?

449
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:29,008
He's a service dog, Your Honor.

450
00:30:29,177 --> 00:30:31,202
DE SALVO:
Well, please make sure he behaves himself.

451
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:33,847
- I just had these carpets cleaned.
CAMPBELL: Yes, ma'am.

452
00:30:34,015 --> 00:30:36,677
Good to see you, Sara.
I wasn't aware you were practicing.

453
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:40,912
I wasn't planning to, Your Honor,
but the complainant is my daughter.

454
00:30:42,156 --> 00:30:43,487
What's this about, counselor?

455
00:30:43,658 --> 00:30:47,594
Mrs. Fitzgerald's youngest child wishes to
be medically emancipated from her parents.

456
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:50,230
There's no legal definition
of medical emancipation...

457
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:52,025
...not in the state of California.

458
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,328
It's one of those New Age terms
that Mr. Alexander has latched onto.

459
00:30:55,503 --> 00:30:58,870
Yes, I'm well aware
of Mr. Alexander's reputation.

460
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,008
He once tried to sue God
in my courtroom.

461
00:31:01,175 --> 00:31:02,267
Did sue, Your Honor.

462
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,638
<i>Jerome Dylan v.
The Diocese of California.</i>

463
00:31:04,812 --> 00:31:07,303
- And I won that one.
- I remember. So?

464
00:31:07,482 --> 00:31:09,541
So Mr. Alexander
wants you to change the law.

465
00:31:09,717 --> 00:31:12,447
An 11-year-old can't be emancipated,
at least not legally.

466
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,679
My client is not seeking
to be emancipated.

467
00:31:14,856 --> 00:31:17,188
She loves her parents
and wants to live at home.

468
00:31:17,358 --> 00:31:19,087
She doesn't wanna be
cut open anymore.

469
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:23,424
Yes, I read the complaint.
What is it exactly that you're after?

470
00:31:23,598 --> 00:31:25,623
Limited termination of parental rights.

471
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,325
DE SALVO:
All right. Very smart.

472
00:31:28,503 --> 00:31:30,869
Very creative.
I assume you have precedent?

473
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,700
<i>Yes, Planned Parenthood v. Danforth.</i>

474
00:31:32,874 --> 00:31:36,332
<i>Mature minor doctrine:
Smith v. Seibly. Agrello v. Florida.</i>

475
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:38,502
And defense is moving
for summary dismissal?

476
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,170
SARA:
Yes. Today, if possible.

477
00:31:40,348 --> 00:31:43,283
Anna's too young to make a decision
of this size on her own.

478
00:31:43,451 --> 00:31:45,442
She doesn't understand
what it is she wants.

479
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,556
She's 11 years old.
She changes her mind every five minutes.

480
00:31:49,724 --> 00:31:52,215
You know how young girls can be.

481
00:31:55,897 --> 00:31:58,661
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I...

482
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:02,566
Mr. Alexander?

483
00:32:02,737 --> 00:32:05,262
The best interests of the child,
Your Honor.

484
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,000
All right.
Well, I need to see Anna. Is she here?

485
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,508
SARA: Yes, but I was really hoping
to keep her out of it.

486
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:14,273
Keep her out of it? Mrs. Fitzgerald,
you just told me your daughter...

487
00:32:14,449 --> 00:32:16,940
...doesn't fully understand
what she wants.

488
00:32:17,118 --> 00:32:19,177
If you want a decision today...

489
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:22,619
...I need to find that out. Do you
have a problem with that, counselor?

490
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:26,157
- None whatsoever.
- All right. Well, please send her in.

491
00:32:27,495 --> 00:32:29,520
CAMPBELL:
Thank you, Your Honor.

492
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:31,958
And Sara?

493
00:32:33,968 --> 00:32:36,596
I'm awfully sorry about Kate.

494
00:32:52,186 --> 00:32:53,710
Thank you.

495
00:32:54,989 --> 00:32:56,115
Hi.

496
00:32:57,258 --> 00:32:58,282
Hi.

497
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:03,829
You can sit down if you like.

498
00:33:06,601 --> 00:33:08,796
Want something to drink?

499
00:33:09,103 --> 00:33:11,128
I've got...

500
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:16,170
...7UP, Dr. Pepper or apple juice.

501
00:33:16,344 --> 00:33:19,404
- 7UP, please.
- 7UP.

502
00:33:22,717 --> 00:33:24,446
Thank you.

503
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:34,361
- So you know why you're here?
- Yup.

504
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:36,190
Pretty scary stuff, huh?

505
00:33:37,465 --> 00:33:40,832
Well, I don't really like everyone
being mad at me.

506
00:33:41,202 --> 00:33:44,603
I meant having to
take care of your sister all the time.

507
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:47,764
No, I don't mind. I like it.

508
00:33:48,242 --> 00:33:49,971
You guys get along okay?

509
00:33:50,144 --> 00:33:52,374
Of course, she's my sister.

510
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:58,615
But all those operations,
it's gotta be pretty crazy, right?

511
00:34:00,722 --> 00:34:02,781
<i>KATE: No, no, no, stop, stop, stop!
ANNA: Okay, okay.</i>

512
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:06,757
Quietly, girls.
This is a hospital, this is not a sorority.

513
00:34:06,928 --> 00:34:09,123
- I need a urine sample.
- But I don't have to go.

514
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,527
- Well, drink something.
- And I'm not thirsty.

515
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,463
Listen to me, young lady,
I don't like a lot of back talk.

516
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:18,537
Drink, don't drink, I don't care.
But you just better fill it.

517
00:34:22,343 --> 00:34:24,402
- What a bitch.
- Right?

518
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:26,604
I'll fill it.

519
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,313
- Nice and warm.
- No.

520
00:34:31,853 --> 00:34:34,651
[BEEPING]

521
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,957
- You ready?
KATE: All set.

522
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:41,456
Oh, wait a minute.

523
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:44,189
Looks a little cloudy.
I think I should filter it again.

524
00:34:49,403 --> 00:34:51,564
Much better. What do you think?

525
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,939
You are disgusting.

526
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,941
And so are you!

527
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:07,111
Look at me, crying like an idiot.

528
00:35:07,989 --> 00:35:10,048
You're not an idiot.

529
00:35:11,425 --> 00:35:14,155
I see idiots every day.

530
00:35:14,629 --> 00:35:16,529
You're not even close.

531
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:21,291
You okay?

532
00:35:21,469 --> 00:35:22,766
Where did you go?

533
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:46,021
- Can I ask you something?
- Shoot.

534
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,823
What was it like when she died?

535
00:35:53,134 --> 00:35:54,567
Who, Dina?

536
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:58,227
Yeah, I mean, what did it feel like?

537
00:36:17,124 --> 00:36:19,058
I'm sorry.

538
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,826
I shouldn't have said anything.

539
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,128
Sometimes I just think things
and then say them.

540
00:36:29,704 --> 00:36:31,535
Did you know Dina?

541
00:36:31,706 --> 00:36:32,968
No.

542
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,301
- No?
- She was older than me.

543
00:36:35,476 --> 00:36:40,345
I mean, I saw her on the TV and everything,
but I didn't know her.

544
00:36:40,514 --> 00:36:42,175
Yeah, you're...

545
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,274
Yeah.

546
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:48,716
- I'm real sorry.
- Don't be.

547
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:51,715
There's no shame in dying.

548
00:36:56,664 --> 00:36:58,495
BAILIFF:
All rise.

549
00:37:05,506 --> 00:37:08,134
I am going to rule against
summary dismissal.

550
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,972
Please clear my calendar and schedule
a hearing for first thing Friday morning.

551
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,170
Thank you.

552
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,848
Hello?

553
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:44,632
<i>KATE: She's usually blowing me off,
but eventually...</i>

554
00:38:44,805 --> 00:38:47,137
Girl, you need a day at the spa.

555
00:38:47,308 --> 00:38:50,800
- Yeah, I don't see that happening...
- The beautician, the mani, the pedi...

556
00:38:50,978 --> 00:38:53,845
...the whole thing.
- Hello, Kate. One to 10, how's your pain?

557
00:38:54,015 --> 00:38:56,176
- Six.
CHANCE: Six?

558
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,910
- All right, let's take care of that.
SARA: Got a minute?

559
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,554
She's feeling pretty good today.

560
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:07,122
Sara, these lucid moments
are gonna get briefer and further apart.

561
00:39:07,795 --> 00:39:12,027
Kate's in system failure now.
Body defenses are at zero.

562
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:15,657
The fevers Kate's been getting,
it's infection from the dialysis.

563
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:19,129
And it's not just in her arm or leg,
it's in her blood.

564
00:39:19,306 --> 00:39:20,830
I wanna see how.

565
00:39:21,008 --> 00:39:23,738
I'm sorry, Sara, this is it.

566
00:39:23,911 --> 00:39:25,811
We're at the end.

567
00:39:26,347 --> 00:39:28,110
Dr. Chance?

568
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,912
What is it, princess?

569
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:41,726
No good, huh?

570
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,099
No.

571
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,834
How long?

572
00:39:52,873 --> 00:39:56,138
It's hard to say.

573
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,006
But if nothing changes...

574
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,040
...not too long.

575
00:40:03,517 --> 00:40:05,144
SARA:
"Not too long"?

576
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,650
Not too long what?

577
00:40:08,022 --> 00:40:09,853
- Will it hurt?
CHANCE: No.

578
00:40:11,192 --> 00:40:13,422
I'll make sure of that.

579
00:40:14,795 --> 00:40:17,787
Listen, I don't wanna hear talk like that,
okay, honey?

580
00:40:17,965 --> 00:40:21,833
You just stay strong enough
for surgery, okay?

581
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,765
Okay, Mom.

582
00:40:24,138 --> 00:40:25,696
CHANCE:
Sara, let's take a walk.

583
00:40:30,711 --> 00:40:33,145
Let me introduce you to someone.

584
00:40:33,948 --> 00:40:36,075
This is Miss Swearingen,
our home health aide.

585
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,911
- Hi, how are you?
- Good, how are you?

586
00:40:38,085 --> 00:40:39,347
I'm good, thank you.

587
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,715
Have you spoken to
the Make-A-Wish people?

588
00:40:44,758 --> 00:40:46,623
What is this?

589
00:40:46,794 --> 00:40:48,853
What is this, the "quality of life" speech?

590
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,827
Mrs. Fitzgerald, you might want to consider
taking Kate home.

591
00:40:51,999 --> 00:40:53,398
- No.
- Making her comfortable...

592
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:55,592
...managing her pain.
- No hospices.

593
00:40:55,769 --> 00:40:58,203
What? You think we should
take Kate home to die?

594
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:01,034
What do you want me to say, Sara?
It's an option.

595
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:04,905
Look, I know you don't listen to anybody,
but it's our job to tell you.

596
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:08,708
Death is a normal process of life.
You need to acknowledge that.

597
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:12,011
- No, I don't. Who is this broad?
- Have you spoken to Kate?

598
00:41:12,186 --> 00:41:14,882
- You know what she wants?
- I don't care what anybody wants.

599
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,319
- We're doing the operation.
- What operation, Sara?

600
00:41:17,491 --> 00:41:19,220
You have an unwilling donor.

Mrs. Fitzgerald, how old was Anna

She was a newborn.

And at 5, she started donating lymphocytes,
is that correct?

Mm-hm.

- Giving blood.

01:21:59,764 --> 01:22:02,790
CAMPBELL: Your Honor...
DE SALVO: Not another word, counselor.

1065
01:22:02,968 --> 01:22:04,401
Proceed, please.

1066
01:22:04,569 --> 01:22:07,800
- I just want to be in charge of
my own body. JESSE: No, you don't.

1067
01:22:08,907 --> 01:22:09,931
Down.

1068
01:22:10,108 --> 01:22:14,875
- You want me to do something about this?
- No, leave it. It's kind of interesting.

1069
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:20,045
Okay, so you want to be in charge.

1070
01:22:20,218 --> 01:22:23,210
Yeah. It's my body, I want to be able
to make my own decisions...

1071
01:22:23,388 --> 01:22:25,356
...about what to do with it.

1072
01:22:28,393 --> 01:22:32,796
No. No, I know you, Anna Fitzgerald,
and that's not it.

1073
01:22:32,964 --> 01:22:34,124
It doesn't add up.

1074
01:22:34,299 --> 01:22:36,597
For a week now
you've been avoiding the question.

1075
01:22:36,768 --> 01:22:40,568
"I can't tell you. " "I'm sorry. "
"I don't wanna talk about it. "

1076
01:22:40,739 --> 01:22:43,003
You've been walking around
like nothing's wrong...

1077
01:22:43,174 --> 01:22:45,267
...while your sister rots in that hospital!

1078
01:22:45,443 --> 01:22:47,934
- I don't wanna do it anymore.
- I don't believe you.

1079
01:22:48,113 --> 01:22:50,240
- You are hiding something, Anna.
- I'm not.

1080
01:22:50,415 --> 01:22:52,610
People give their kidneys
to total strangers.

1081
01:22:52,784 --> 01:22:55,218
- You'd better start talking right now.
ANNA: I'm talking!

1082
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:57,412
- You start telling me the truth.
- I am!

1083
01:22:57,589 --> 01:22:59,955
You're not.
Because if you are, I don't know you.

1084
01:23:00,125 --> 01:23:02,719
- Jesus Christ, Anna, just tell them.
- You shut up!

1085
01:23:02,894 --> 01:23:05,294
- Tell them!
- You promised me you wouldn't do this!

1086
01:23:05,463 --> 01:23:06,487
JESSE:
Tell them!

1087
01:23:06,665 --> 01:23:08,462
- God, you people are so stupid!
ANNA: You promised!

1088
01:23:08,633 --> 01:23:10,225
- Kate wants to die!
ANNA: Stop it!

1089
01:23:14,272 --> 01:23:17,605
She's making Anna do all this
because she knows she's not gonna survive.

1090
01:23:17,776 --> 01:23:19,903
- That's a lie, Jesse!
- Oh, no, it's not!

1091
01:23:20,078 --> 01:23:21,943
Kate's dying and everybody knows it.

1092
01:23:22,113 --> 01:23:24,877
You just love her so much
that you don't want to let her go.

1093
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:26,074
Your Honor?

1094
01:23:26,251 --> 01:23:28,776
But it's time, Mom. Kate's ready.

1095
01:23:30,055 --> 01:23:32,148
That's not true.

1096
01:23:32,557 --> 01:23:33,785
Kate would have told me.

1097
01:23:33,958 --> 01:23:37,223
- Your Honor, I...
- Mom, she did tell you.

1098
01:23:37,395 --> 01:23:38,987
BRIAN:
She did.

1099
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:42,491
She told you a million times.
You didn't wanna hear it.

1100
01:23:52,377 --> 01:23:53,708
Mr. Alexander.

1101
01:23:54,546 --> 01:23:57,515
<i>Mr. Alexander.</i>

1102
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:10,623
<i>ANNA:
Right then, I understood the real reason...</i>

1103
01:24:10,795 --> 01:24:14,094
<i>...why Campbell Alexander
took on my case.</i>

1104
01:24:14,265 --> 01:24:16,733
<i>It wasn't for the notoriety.</i>

1105
01:24:16,901 --> 01:24:19,199
<i>He was an epileptic.</i>

1106
01:24:19,537 --> 01:24:22,597
<i>He knew what it was like
to not have control over his own body.</i>

1107
01:24:22,774 --> 01:24:24,002
<i>KATE:
Anna?</i>

1108
01:24:26,711 --> 01:24:28,542
Sissy.

1109
01:24:31,349 --> 01:24:33,010
Oh, my God.

1110
01:24:33,184 --> 01:24:34,981
Oh, my God.

1111
01:24:54,739 --> 01:24:56,001
KATE:
Don't worry.

1112
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:59,632
It's just the new medicine
getting ready for the kidney.

1113
01:25:01,746 --> 01:25:03,407
You in pain?

1114
01:25:03,581 --> 01:25:05,139
Pain?

1115
01:25:06,084 --> 01:25:08,484
My whole life is a pain.

1116
01:25:22,433 --> 01:25:24,924
This is the end, sissy.

1117
01:25:26,604 --> 01:25:29,630
It just gets scarier from here on out.

1118
01:25:32,143 --> 01:25:35,078
Mom's gonna chop me and cut me...

1119
01:25:36,114 --> 01:25:38,412
...till I'm a vegetable.

1120
01:25:41,886 --> 01:25:46,516
Two cells in a Petri dish
that she shocks with an electric cord.

1121
01:25:46,958 --> 01:25:48,789
You'll be all right.

1122
01:25:52,997 --> 01:25:54,828
It's over.

1123
01:25:55,266 --> 01:25:56,460
Time to go.

1124
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:06,809
I need you to do me a favor, sissy.

1125
01:26:08,713 --> 01:26:10,305
What favor?

1126
01:26:12,317 --> 01:26:14,785
You can release me.

1127
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:27,394
Are you certain you don't wanna
take the rest of the day off?

1128
01:26:27,565 --> 01:26:29,965
Oh, no, Your Honor. I'm fine.

1129
01:26:30,368 --> 01:26:32,996
Anything for a recess, right?

1130
01:26:36,074 --> 01:26:38,304
So, Anna, for the record.

1131
01:26:38,476 --> 01:26:42,606
Did you tell Kate you would stop
being a donor so that she could die?

1132
01:26:43,047 --> 01:26:45,709
- Yeah.
- And what did she say?

1133
01:26:48,853 --> 01:26:50,377
<i>ANNA:
Mom and Dad are gonna kill me.</i>

1134
01:26:50,822 --> 01:26:52,722
What am I supposed to tell them?

1135
01:26:52,891 --> 01:26:55,325
KATE:
Tell them you're important too.

1136
01:26:55,860 --> 01:26:57,885
Tell them you wanna play soccer.

1137
01:26:58,062 --> 01:27:00,428
Tell them you wanna cheerlead.

1138
01:27:00,598 --> 01:27:02,065
They'll never believe me.

1139
01:27:02,233 --> 01:27:03,962
Yeah, they will.

1140
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:06,695
And you wanna know why?

1141
01:27:07,872 --> 01:27:09,806
Because it's the truth.

1142
01:27:10,575 --> 01:27:13,703
ANNA: Oh, boy.
- I know.

1143
01:27:20,118 --> 01:27:21,915
ANNA:
You scared?

1144
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:26,085
No. I know I'll be okay.

1145
01:27:28,192 --> 01:27:30,558
What do you think happens?

1146
01:27:30,895 --> 01:27:34,626
I mean, where do you go?

1147
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:37,726
I don't know, baby.

1148
01:27:39,470 --> 01:27:41,404
But who knows?

1149
01:27:43,374 --> 01:27:45,899
Wherever it is, maybe I'll run into Taylor.

1150
01:27:48,713 --> 01:27:50,510
Will you wait for me?

1151
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:52,309
What?

1152
01:27:52,483 --> 01:27:56,180
If you go anywhere crazy, will you wait?

1153
01:27:56,354 --> 01:28:00,848
I mean, how will I know
how to find you?

1154
01:28:03,161 --> 01:28:06,619
If you're ever lost or scared...

1155
01:28:06,798 --> 01:28:08,561
...go to Montana.

1156
01:28:09,167 --> 01:28:11,397
- Montana?
- Yeah.

1157
01:28:12,136 --> 01:28:14,036
That's where I'll be.

1158
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:18,099
ANNA:
Okay.

1159
01:28:19,477 --> 01:28:21,945
What did she say, Anna?

1160
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,404
She said, "Thanks. "

1161
01:28:28,753 --> 01:28:30,880
All right,
I think I have enough information...

1162
01:28:31,055 --> 01:28:34,650
...but before I make my decision,
I'd like to visit Kate, if that's all right.

1163
01:28:38,062 --> 01:28:43,591
It's hard to say. It takes from anywhere
between 24 and 48 hours or so.

1164

Look, I got you this book, okay?

It's full of guided meditations,

And pepperoni and everything.

Thank you.

1191
01:30:48,659 --> 01:30:51,526
You've just gotta tell yourself
you're gonna get better.

1192
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:55,393
Tell your brain to heal yourself
and work on it while you're sleeping.

1193
01:30:55,566 --> 01:30:57,625
- Okay.
- I'm not kidding.

01:30:57,802 --> 01:30:59,235
- No, I will. I promise.
- Okay.

1195
01:30:59,403 --> 01:31:01,530
Subconscious mind
is a really powerful thing.

1196
01:31:01,706 --> 01:31:04,470
Yeah, you know,
it's like this lady I saw on TV.

1197
01:31:04,642 --> 01:31:08,203
She would talk to her cancer cells
and ask them to go away.

1198
01:31:08,379 --> 01:31:11,314
And eventually they did.
I did not make this up, this is true.

1199
01:31:11,482 --> 01:31:13,814
- "Go away, cancer cells. "
TOMMY'S WIFE: Yeah, like that.

1200
01:31:13,985 --> 01:31:16,419
- "Out. "
- Speaking more sincerely than that.

1201
01:31:16,587 --> 01:31:19,818
TOMMY: What about that prisoner story?
Prisoners are in there for 10 years...

1202
01:31:19,991 --> 01:31:24,291
...and practicing their invisible golf swing.
They practice, and see it in their mind...

1203
01:31:24,462 --> 01:31:27,920
...so by the time they get out, boom,
they're scratch golfers.

1204
01:31:28,099 --> 01:31:30,363
It's true.
I've even heard about those mothers...

1205
01:31:30,535 --> 01:31:32,435
...the ones who get supernatural power...

1206
01:31:32,603 --> 01:31:35,504
...and they can lift up a car
and save their babies. It's amazing.

1207
01:31:35,673 --> 01:31:38,073
TOMMY'S WIFE: Miracles happen every day.
PERVIS: That's right.

1208
01:31:38,242 --> 01:31:40,233
This world isn't

1209
01:31:40,411 --> 01:31:44,313
There are powerful things out there
