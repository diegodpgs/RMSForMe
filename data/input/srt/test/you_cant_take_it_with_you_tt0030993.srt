1
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:13,358
- Good morning, Mr. Kirby.
- Good morning.

2
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:16,882
- Good morning, A.P.
- Good morning.

3
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:18,561
Good morning.

4
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:25,681
- No pictures.
- New York Times, Mr. Kirby.

5
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:27,760
We'd like a statement
on the business outlook.

6
00:01:27,849 --> 00:01:30,886
The newspapers should know
Mr. Kirby never issues any statements.

7
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:32,084
Come on, come on.

8
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,927
I got your telegram, Mr. Kirby.
They're waiting in your office.

9
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:38,124
Good.

10
00:01:38,449 --> 00:01:39,484
Hello, A.P.

11
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:41,366
- You're looking well.
- How was the trip?

12
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:42,768
- Hi, Dad.
- I'm glad to get home.

13
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:43,918
- Tony, how are you?
- Good.

14
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,044
- How's your mother?
- Fine.

15
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:48,007
Good, I nearly sent for you.
You might like the White House.

16
00:01:48,089 --> 00:01:48,999
Sorry you didn't.

17
00:01:49,089 --> 00:01:51,728
- How do you like being vice president?
- Painless so far.

18
00:01:51,809 --> 00:01:54,607
He still talks
as if he were having a tooth yanked.

19
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:57,044
- What happened in Washington?
- What did you find out?

20
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:59,404
- How do we stand?
- Get me some bicarbonate of soda.

21
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:01,081
How do we stand, A.P.?

22
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:03,683
There will be no interference
from the powers that be.

23
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:05,088
- There won't?
- Are you sure?

24
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:07,319
What about the senator
with the anti-trust complex?

25
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,206
I said there'd be no interference.

26
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:11,359
We're going ahead exactly as we planned.

27
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:14,805
It'll be the largest individual monopoly
in the world if we're smart.

28
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:17,039
Particularly now that Ramsey is lined up.

29
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:20,166
- That's impossible.
- The administration'd never stand for that.

30
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:23,082
- We'd control every type of war material.
- That's exactly it.

31
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:26,047
With the world going crazy,
the next big move is munitions.

32
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:28,120
And Kirby and Company will cash in on it.

33
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:29,085
It's unbelievable.

34
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:31,205
A war wouldn't be possible anywhere
without us.

35
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:34,281
If I know Ramsey, he'll never let himself
be absorbed by anybody.

36
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:35,404
- Won't he?
- No.

37
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,128
We'll see if he will
when I hand him a little surprise.

38
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:41,884
I own every inch of the 12 blocks
that surround the Ramsey factories.

39
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:44,927
- News to us!
- We didn't know anything about that.

40
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:48,001
So, how is he going to fulfil his contracts
without us?

41
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:51,161
You'd better get busy.
Complete your negotiations with the others.

42
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:53,922
- I'll handle Ramsey myself.
- We'll hop right to it.

43
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:56,477
I have a meeting with my nitrate group
this afternoon.

44
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:57,558
Good.

45
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:02,319
$10,000 a year for doctors
and I'm still taking this stuff.

46
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:07,804
- Son, what do you think about it?
- Don't ask me.

47
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:09,800
You know how cockeyed
my sense of value is.

48
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:13,598
Get me that sour-faced real estate agent
on the phone. What's his name?

49
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:16,522
- Blakely.
- Yeah. Private line.

50
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:20,641
- Dad, how do you feel?
- Rotten. It's my stomach.

51
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:21,764
I thought so.

52
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:25,159
These trips to Washington have me jittery.
But it's the last one.

53
00:03:25,249 --> 00:03:26,841
From now on, they come to me.

54
00:03:26,929 --> 00:03:31,957
Tony, do you realise there won't be a bullet,
gun or cannon made here without us?

55
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:36,799
Now, Dad, don't tell me
you've forgotten the slingshot market.

56
00:03:41,649 --> 00:03:43,321
Mr. Blakely on the phone.

57
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:46,807
Hello, Blakely. This is A.P. How's it going?

58
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:49,367
You what? What trouble?

59
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:51,804
Now, wait a minute. Don't bite my head off.

60
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:54,198
I've got all 12 blocks, everything...

61
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:57,520
...with the exception of one little lot
and I can't get the man to sell.

62
00:03:57,609 --> 00:04:00,601
Those 12 blocks are useless
unless I get every inch of them.

63
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:02,964
I'm up against some kind of an old crank.

64
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:04,960
His house isn't worth over $25,000.

65
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:07,563
I've already offered him $50,000,
but he's standing pat.

66
00:04:07,649 --> 00:04:09,958
If you can't get it with money
there are other ways.

67
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,119
That's up to you. Now, remember this:

68
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:16,088
Unless you buy up the whole 12 blocks,
you won't get a penny commission.

69
00:04:18,249 --> 00:04:20,809
That man has got ice water in his veins.

70
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:22,641
The description fits only one man.

71
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,879
I've simply got to get that property, Bill.

72
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:27,358
You can't force a man
to sell his home, John.

73
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:31,237
I've got to. I'll make him sell
if I have to drive him out with stink bombs.

74
00:04:31,369 --> 00:04:35,157
Listen, a fortune has been invested
in those 12 blocks.

75
00:04:35,249 --> 00:04:39,037
Behind it is one of the most powerful men
in the country, and a silly old man...

76
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:42,360
...with that silly little house
is holding up the whole business.

77
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,998
- Now, how do you like that?
- Excuse me, John, but I think it's great.

78
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:49,161
What did he say when you offered him
$50,000 for his place?

79
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:51,638
I'm not sure,
but I think someone began singing.

80
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:55,847
Someone danced and Grandpa Vanderhof
sat down and played a mouth organ.

81
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,203
Played a mouth organ?

82
00:04:57,289 --> 00:04:59,678
- What are they, a bunch of nuts?
- Fascinating ones.

83
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:03,284
- It's the old army game.
- I doubt it. He's not interested in money.

84
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:04,643
Mr. Vanderhof is here.

85
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:08,278
- Have him come in right away.
- How did you get him to come here?

86
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:10,724
Not interested in money, eh?

87
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:13,369
Miss Jones, just a minute.
Don't send him in yet.

88
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:15,049
Have him wait. Let him cool his heels.

89
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:16,038
Yes, sir.

90
00:05:17,929 --> 00:05:20,489
- He will just be a minute, Mr. Vanderhof.
- Thank you.

91
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:24,244
That guy wanting me
to split commissions three ways?

92
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:45,847
What are you doing?

93
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:49,083
My goodness. I made a mistake.

94
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:51,086
First time in 20 years.

95
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:54,479
That calls for the building to collapse,
I suppose?

96
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:57,567
- Have some.
- No, thank you. It'll spoil my appetite.

97
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:00,085
What are you doing that for?

98
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:03,048
I have to add up these figures
to see if they're right.

99
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,118
Why?

100
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:07,925
Why? Because they have to check
against these figures.

101
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:11,797
- Say, do you like this?
- Like it?

102
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:15,643
- This work you're doing.
- No, my goodness, no.

103
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:18,680
Land's sake, what am I saying?

104
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:20,921
Well, why do you do it?

105
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:23,762
Look, they're very strict
in this office and I...

106
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:27,007
Isn't there something else
you'd rather be doing than this?

107
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:28,124
No!

108
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:31,326
Go along with you.
I don't believe a word you're saying.

109
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:34,924
Go on, tell me,
what would you rather be doing than this?

110
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:38,439
I make up things.

111
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:42,447
- Poetry?
- No. Just things.

112
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,560
Go on. Let me see some of them.

113
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:01,841
- That's kind of cute.
- It is, isn't it? I made it up myself.

114
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:02,725
Yes.

115
00:07:02,809 --> 00:07:05,084
I have a lot of other ideas just like it.

116
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:10,038
Well, what do you mean
fooling around with those dull figures?

117
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:12,960
Seems to me, Mr...

118
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:15,239
"Poppins."

119
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:20,278
It seems to me, that is the kind of work
you ought to be doing.

120
00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:24,681
Some day I am going to do nothing else.
Some day, when my ship comes in.

121
00:07:26,049 --> 00:07:30,201
How'd you like to come over to our house
and work on your gadgets?

122
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:31,483
Over to your house?

123
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:35,278
- Well, I don't know. I thank you, but...
- Oh, go along. You'd love it.

124
00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:38,520
Everybody over at our place
does just what he wants to do.

125
00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:39,803
Really?

126
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,080
That must be wonderful.

127
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:46,206
- But how would I live?
- The same way we do.

128
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:48,043
The same way.

129
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:50,160
Well, who takes care of you?

130
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:54,208
The same one that takes care
of the lilies of the field, Mr. Poppins.

131
00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:59,406
Except that we toy a little,
spin a little, have a barrel of fun.

132
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:03,001
If you want to,
come on over and become a lily, too.

133
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:06,047
A lily? Me? A lily of the field?

134
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:08,364
What's that?

135
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:11,646
Just a little something
Mr. Poppins whipped up.

136
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:13,367
Why, Mr. Poppins.

137
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:15,201
Ethel, come here. Take a look at this.

138
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:16,927
Alice, George, John.

139
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:19,284
- Did you do that?
- Isn't that clever?

140
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:21,644
Aren't you clever, Mr. Poppins?

141
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:23,640
Where is he, Miss Jones?

142
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:29,600
What's going on here?

143
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:34,641
Welcome, Mr. Vanderhof.
Come right into my office.

144
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:38,085
- No, thank you, Mr. Blakely. I'm going.
- Going?

145
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:40,285
- Hello, Mr. Hughes.
- How do you do?

146
00:08:40,369 --> 00:08:43,122
What's happened?
You were all right last time I saw you.

147
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:46,963
One of my granddaughters dared me
to slide down the banister.

148
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:52,606
- Too bad, is it serious?
- No, just a sprain or something.

149
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:55,323
The thing I like most about it
is the crutches.

150
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:59,197
I've been wanting to walk on them
ever since I was a kid, haven't you?

151
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,803
Oh, yes, must be a lot of fun.

152
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:04,608
Well, Mr. Vanderhof,
I believe we understand each other.

153
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:06,759
Now, I'm ready to do business.

154
00:09:06,849 --> 00:09:09,443
Say, that's a bad twitch in your eye.

155
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,882
You've been working too hard.
You ought to take a vacation.

156
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,598
If it's all the same to you, Mr. Vanderhof,
let's quit playing games.

157
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,042
I'm a very busy man.

158
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:21,963
A couple of weeks fishing
will fix up that twitch, Mr. Blakely.

159
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:26,278
I've got to go to the graduation exercises
over at the university.

160
00:09:26,369 --> 00:09:29,918
Look, I have a cheque here for $100,000.
If you're interested...

161
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:31,806
- Have you been to one lately?
- No.

162
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:33,880
They're a truckload of fun.

163
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:40,166
You ought to hear the speeches.
I'd better be going. I'll be late.

164
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:45,123
Lookout for that twitch, Mr. Blakely.

165
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:52,884
Coming, Poppins?

166
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:56,041
I'd like to, but I don't think... I'd better not.

167
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:59,644
- Yes, sir.
- This is all your fault. You and your toys.

168
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:02,638
You...

169
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:07,605
Wait a minute, please.

170
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:14,767
If you leave, Poppins,
you needn't come back.

171
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,682
Wait, wait.

172
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:26,001
The die is cast.

173
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:27,882
I'm a lily.

174
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:29,881
Have some popcorn.

175
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:37,521
Did your grandpa go
to the graduation exercises, Miss Essie?

176
00:10:37,609 --> 00:10:38,883
Guess so.

177
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:43,045
I wonder how many folks
Grandpa will bring home for dinner tonight.

178
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:46,405
I don't know. It all depends on
whether he goes walking in the park.

179
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:49,367
Well, let him bring them.
I'll be ready for them.

180
00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:00,638
- Mother, will you taste a Love Dream for me?
- Not now. I'm busy.

181
00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:06,845
Do you have to make candy today, Essie?
It's so hot.

182
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:09,602
Well, Ed went out
and got a bunch of new orders.

183
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:12,920
- How did it taste to you?
- If this keeps up, you'll be opening a store.

184
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:16,285
That's what Ed was saying last night,
but I said no.

185
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:19,557
No. I want to be a dancer.

186
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:26,404
Finish your second act yet, Mrs. Sycamore?

187
00:11:26,489 --> 00:11:28,719
No, I've got Cynthia
just entering the monastery.

188
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:30,322
I'll be right down, Mr. DePinna.

189
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:33,207
I just want to show my wife
these new firecrackers we made.

190
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:36,326
Penny, we can make up a lot of these
before the Fourth of July...

191
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:39,003
...and sell them for 10 cents a string. Watch.

192
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:41,442
Watch, Penny.

193
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:51,644
Nice, huh?

194
00:11:51,729 --> 00:11:54,846
- Yes, Paul.
- Kids will go for those like hotcakes.

195
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:59,923
Mr. Sycamore, I'm afraid we've got
the powder chamber too near the balloon.

196
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:04,967
- Let's go down to the cellar and try it.
- Where's Grandpa? Let's ask Grandpa.

197
00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:07,923
I ain't done nothing, but I'm sure tired.

198
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:10,768
You're always tired. From what?
You was born tired.

199
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:13,124
Here, you're just in time to set the table.

200
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:16,963
I don't see why I got to do your work
just because we're engaged.

201
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:23,846
- Donald, were you ever in a monastery?
- No, I don't go no place much.

202
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:25,408
I'm on relief.

203
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:30,562
Hello, Momma.

204
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:33,879
What do you say, Donald boy?

205
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:37,760
Well, I delivered all the candy.
Where's my beautiful wife?

206
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:42,523
Oh, lordy!

207
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:44,565
Here's a new one, Ed. Taste it.

208
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:48,167
- I'm calling it Love Dreams.
- Boy, you're a whiz.

209
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:50,888
Listen to this tune.
It's been ringing in my ears all day.

210
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:52,800
- Come on back a minute, Essie.
- What tune?

211
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:57,724
This is a beauty. You'll like this.
Let me turn the little do-jigger on.

212
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:13,328
I like that, Ed. Yours?

213
00:13:13,969 --> 00:13:15,038
No, Chopin.

214
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:17,199
Well, it's got a lot of you in it.

215
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:26,120
What do you say there, Donald?

216
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:35,118
Well, you should have been there.
Everybody should have been there.

217
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:40,203
- Hello, Grandpa. How's your foot?
- How's my foot? Is that all I get?

218
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:45,446
Big class this year, Grandpa?

219
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:48,487
- How many were there?
- There must have been two acres.

220
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:50,840
Everybody graduated.

221
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:54,283
The speeches were funnier this year, too.

222
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:57,486
If you want to hear a good speech,
you ought to hear Father Divine.

223
00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:00,481
Don't you worry. They'll have him there yet.

224
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:08,327
See if this sounds any better to you,
Mr. DePinna.

225
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:20,728
Mr. Poppins, excuse me.

226
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:26,288
This is my granddaughter, Essie,
and this is her husband, Mr. Carmichael.

227
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:27,883
Hello.

228
00:14:27,969 --> 00:14:30,563
- What do you say, Mr. Poppins?
- How do you do?

229
00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:33,442
Help yourself to a Love Dream.
They're on the table.

230
00:14:42,489 --> 00:14:45,242
And this is my daughter, Mrs. Sycamore.

231
00:14:45,849 --> 00:14:48,761
- This is Mr. Poppins, dear.
- How do you do?

232
00:14:48,849 --> 00:14:51,886
Have a chair, Mr. Poppins.
Were you ever in a monastery?

233
00:14:51,969 --> 00:14:54,437
In a monastery? Well, I...

234
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:56,281
What's the matter, Penny? Stuck?

235
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:59,281
Yes, I sort of got myself in a monastery
and I can't get out.

236
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:03,567
It'll come to you.
Remember how you got out of that jail?

237
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,485
Oh, that's fine, Ed.

238
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:09,647
- Is Alice coming home to dinner?
- She didn't say.

239
00:15:09,729 --> 00:15:12,197
I think she should stop working
in that millinery shop.

240
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:14,007
They make her stay so late.

241
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:16,364
Penny, she hasn't been there
for five months.

242
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:17,802
She hasn't?

243
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:21,605
Isn't that a shame?
She was going to get me a hat I liked.

244
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:25,568
- She works for bankers now.
- Bankers? That's wonderful.

245
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:28,562
Essie's dancing teacher
wants to borrow $100 on his car.

246
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:29,877
Do you think she could fix it?

247
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:33,678
Sure, Kirby and Company
just loaned somebody $80 million.

248
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:44,405
I must speak to Alice about it.

249
00:15:57,929 --> 00:15:59,157
Mr. DePinna was right.

250
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,365
The powder chamber
was too close to the balloon.

251
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:03,167
- Have a Love Dream, Father.
- No, thanks.

252
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:06,878
Mr. Poppins, this is Mr. Sycamore,
my son-in-law.

253
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:08,163
How do you do?

254
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:10,968
We're testing a new skyrocket
and Mr. DePinna was saying...

255
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:14,166
Knew it all the time.
You can't have that powder chamber close.

256
00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:16,285
Mr. Poppins, Mr. DePinna.

257
00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:17,963
How do you do?

258
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:21,724
- Mr. Poppins is going to stay with us.
- Oh, really? How wonderful!

259
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:23,322
Just for a short time. You see...

260
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:27,084
That's what I thought, that day
nine years ago when I delivered the ice.

261
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:28,648
Nine years ago?

262
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:30,723
You were the ice man.

263
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:32,845
- Mr. Poppins makes up things.
- Really?

264
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:33,918
You do?

265
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:43,003
Say, that's wonderful!

266
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:45,080
- Did you make that all by yourself?
- Yes.

267
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:46,079
That beats all.

268
00:16:46,169 --> 00:16:49,047
- I have other ideas, too. Better ones.
- You have?

269
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:53,088
- Let's go down to the shop.
- You have a shop? That's marvellous.

270
00:16:59,849 --> 00:17:00,884
Mrs. Penny...

271
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:04,645
...why don't you write a play
about "ism" mania?

272
00:17:04,729 --> 00:17:06,959
- "Ism" mania?
- Yes, sure.

273
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:10,885
You know, communism, fascism...

274
00:17:11,249 --> 00:17:15,527
...voodooism,
everybody's got an "ism" these days.

275
00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:19,848
- I thought it was an itch or something.
- Well, it's just as catching.

276
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:24,726
When things go a little bad nowadays,
you go out and get yourself an "ism"...

277
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:26,606
...and you're in business.

278
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:27,485
I got it.

279
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:30,606
It might help Cynthia to have an "ism"
in the monastery.

280
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:33,240
Yes, it might at that.

281
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:38,000
Only give her Americanism.
Let her know something about Americans.

282
00:17:39,209 --> 00:17:43,566
John Paul Jones, Patrick Henry,
Samuel Adams.

283
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:46,408
Washington, Jefferson, Monroe.

284
00:17:46,489 --> 00:17:51,119
Lincoln, Grant, Lee, Edison and Mark Twain.

285
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:56,687
When things got tough with those boys,
they didn't run around looking for "isms."

286
00:17:57,849 --> 00:18:02,764
Lincoln said, "With malice toward none,
with charity for all."

287
00:18:04,489 --> 00:18:09,085
Nowadays they say, "Think the way I do
or I'll bomb the daylights out of you."

288
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:16,769
Why don't you go back
to your war play, Mrs. Sycamore?

289
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:20,398
- I like that one best.
- Really, Rheba? Well, maybe I will.

290
00:18:22,489 --> 00:18:25,322
Hello. Miss Alice Sycamore, please.

291
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:36,004
You know, every once in a while
I get a very strange sensation.

292
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:38,603
I seem to hear a ringing in my ears.

293
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:42,559
Me, too. I thought for a moment
it was the telephone.

294
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:43,838
Yeah.

295
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:45,922
I hear voices, too.

296
00:18:46,769 --> 00:18:50,603
Voices that say, "If you don't kiss her soon,
you're a chump."

297
00:18:50,689 --> 00:18:55,319
If I were really clever, I could answer
the phone without the use of my hands.

298
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:57,365
I saw it done in a circus once.

299
00:18:58,849 --> 00:18:59,964
Good.

300
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:03,928
That's wonderful.
I bet you'd be a sensation on a trapeze.

301
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:08,480
- Mr. Anthony Kirby Jr.'s office.
- Now, that's clever the way you say that.

302
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:10,763
Hello, Rheba.

303
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:12,444
No, Rheba.

304
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:14,686
Were you ever in a monastery?

305
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:20,167
No, but I'm the fellow
that got caught in a cave once.

306
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,081
- Really?
- Yeah.

307
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:23,841
Whatever happened to you?

308
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:28,162
Well, the cave caved in
and I haven't been heard from since.

309
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:32,604
Mrs. Kirby.

310
00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:35,647
Hello, Mr. Hammond.
I'm just going in to see my son, Tony.

311
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:38,926
He's a very busy man nowadays.
I doubt if you can see him.

312
00:19:40,569 --> 00:19:44,278
Dinner? Wait a minute, Rheba.
Wants to know if I will be home for dinner.

313
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:46,803
- No.
- The man says no, Rheba.

314
00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:50,162
Tell Grandpa that I love him
just as much as ever...

315
00:19:50,249 --> 00:19:53,764
...but a terrible, young vice president
has me in his power.

316
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:56,360
Of course I'm struggling, Rheba.

317
00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:59,885
It would do your heart good
to see me struggle, Rheba.

318
00:20:05,449 --> 00:20:06,928
Hello, Mother.

319
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:14,001
If you'll excuse me,
I think I'll visit with your father for a while.

320
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:21,200
- Busy, wasn't he?
- Definitely.

321
00:20:27,969 --> 00:20:31,325
Goodbye, Rheba. The ceiling just fell in.

322
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:42,200
Would you be so kind as to give me
the want ad section of the newspaper?

323
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:46,843
I'm sorry, Alice.

324
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:49,238
Cheques to be countersigned, Mr. Kirby.

325
00:21:08,689 --> 00:21:12,568
I wouldn't mind his carrying on in the office,
but he's getting serious about her.

326
00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:15,038
Miriam, it'll be bigger
than steel and can together.

327
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:17,006
Talked to me for hours about her last night.

328
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:18,078
Answer those.

329
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:19,443
- Who?
- Tony.

330
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:23,238
Talked to me for hours about his secretary.
Told me he was...

331
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:25,202
- Yes?
- Mr. Ramsey to see you.

332
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:26,324
I'm too busy.

333
00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:28,286
- Says he's in trouble.
- I don't care.

334
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:29,404
Anthony.

335
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:34,041
Yes, about Tony. I'll speak to him.
That was Ramsey.

336
00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:36,643
Just found out what's up,
and is he screaming for help!

337
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:39,641
- But in the meantime, what about this girl?
- No.

338
00:21:39,729 --> 00:21:41,481
What sort of a family is she from?

339
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:44,641
- Who? The secretary?
- Yes. Not steel or can, or Ramsey, or...

340
00:21:44,729 --> 00:21:46,640
All right. Don't get so excited about it.

341
00:21:46,729 --> 00:21:50,085
The girl is a stenographer.
Boys like Tony don't marry stenographers.

342
00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:54,287
- Anthony, we must do something about her.
- All right, I'll fire her.

343
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:57,759
This isn't a business deal.
You can't settle anything by firing the girl.

344
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,238
All right, then. I won't fire her.
Hello. What?

345
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:02,285
No. I didn't mean you.

346
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:11,043
- You weren't going out, were you?
- Yes. I thought I...

347
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:13,199
We had a date, don't you remember?

348
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:15,288
I'm sorry. I forgot.

349
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:18,600
Yeah, we ought to discuss where to go,
don't you think?

350
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:23,280
We can't just pop out
of the building with no place to go.

351
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:25,246
That's a very bad idea.

352
00:22:25,889 --> 00:22:29,359
I knew two people that did that once.
They went out of the building.

353
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:34,682
They were uncertain, so they just walked
and walked, and finally they died...

354
00:22:34,969 --> 00:22:35,924
...of hunger.

355
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:40,366
You wouldn't want anything like that
to happen. Because if that happened...

356
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:45,048
You're so beautiful.

357
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:48,648
Sometimes you're so beautiful
it just gags me.

358
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:51,887
Maybe you're not real.
Maybe you're a phantom.

359
00:22:51,969 --> 00:22:54,244
I keep expecting you to vanish.

360
00:22:54,769 --> 00:22:57,761
Look, you better sit down over here
for a while.

361
00:22:57,849 --> 00:23:00,886
Phantoms don't vanish very often
in a sitting position.

362
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:03,804
There. Now, wait a minute.

363
00:23:04,969 --> 00:23:06,084
Here.

364
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:13,083
Here.

365
00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:15,477
Now, let's see.

366
00:23:23,729 --> 00:23:25,924
- That's a very lovely picture.
- Tony, I...

367
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:28,318
Now, wait a minute. Don't say anything.

368
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:29,808
Now look, phantom.

369
00:23:29,889 --> 00:23:33,928
Last night I informed that irate lady
who was just in your office...

370
00:23:34,689 --> 00:23:36,919
...that I was going to marry you.

371
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:43,398
I don't remember you telling it to me.

372
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,045
Well, you didn't ask me.

373
00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:49,197
- That's right, I didn't.
- No, but she did.

374
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:51,439
I talked about you so much
that she finally said:

375
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:54,407
"Next thing I expect to hear
is that you'll marry the girl."

376
00:23:54,489 --> 00:23:56,764
And I said, "Yeah, that's it exactly."

377
00:23:57,529 --> 00:23:59,759
- What did she say?
- Nothing.

378
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:04,399
- Just fainted dead away.
- No, she took it standing up.

379
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:22,318
You know, if you scratch
under the surface here...

380
00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:24,718
...you'll find a proposal lying around.

381
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:37,444
I admit it's kind of left-handed.

382
00:24:37,689 --> 00:24:39,964
I can't help that.

383
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:42,398
I'm sort of a left-handed guy, you know.

384
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:44,443
Oh, Tony.

385
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:48,641
What about them?

386
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:49,998
Mother and Dad?

387
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:53,240
Did you see the way she looked at me?
I know what she was thinking.

388
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:57,925
There seems to be the impression
that the Kirbys are ogres or something.

389
00:24:58,009 --> 00:25:00,318
If they are,
that doesn't make any difference to me.

390
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:02,286
They're just putty in my hands, Alice.

391
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:06,157
I never wanted anything that I couldn't get
if I just yelled loud enough.

392
00:25:06,249 --> 00:25:08,763
Worked like a charm when I was a baby,
and since then...

393
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:12,922
...I've had so much practice that I'm terrific.
Here, I'll give you an idea.

394
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:22,643
Oh, Tony.

395
00:25:28,689 --> 00:25:31,567
One little detail I forgot to mention.

396
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:33,481
I love you, Alice.

397
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:41,442
- Hello, Grandpa.
- Hey, Grandpa.

398
00:25:45,729 --> 00:25:49,642
Yes, I have some of Essie's Love Dreams.

399
00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:53,799
There he is. The man on the crutches.
You've got to get something on him.

400
00:25:53,889 --> 00:25:55,242
What do you want us to do?

401
00:25:55,329 --> 00:25:58,526
I don't care,
just make him sell that property.

402
00:25:58,609 --> 00:26:02,443
- Hello, Grandpa, how's the foot?
- Hello, Mac. Oh, fine, thanks.

403
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:05,441
Say, what's the meeting
over at Jensen's bakery?

404
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:07,997
They're excited about having to move out
or something.

405
00:26:08,089 --> 00:26:10,728
- Move out?
- Yes, that's what I heard.

406
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:13,369
They're coming over to see you now,
I guess.

407
00:26:15,969 --> 00:26:18,642
Did you hear about it, Grandpa?
We maybe all have to move.

408
00:26:18,729 --> 00:26:19,639
Who said so?

409
00:26:19,729 --> 00:26:22,721
Everyone's talking about it.
Somebody's buying up everything here.

410
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:24,879
They've been trying to buy it up
for a factory.

411
00:26:24,969 --> 00:26:27,688
My landlord told me
that they offered him a lot of money.

412
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:29,487
Nobody wants to move. You know that.

413
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:33,118
- Emil put up some new shelves. Cost $60.
- I've been here for 20 years.

414
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:36,918
- I think we ought to see somebody about it.
- Wait a minute. Don't get excited.

415
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:40,046
We've all been neighbours for a long time.
I know that.

416
00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:42,802
But if they're buying this property up
for a factory...

417
00:26:42,889 --> 00:26:45,244
...they'll need every foot of ground,
won't they?

418
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:46,159
I guess so.

419
00:26:46,249 --> 00:26:49,446
Well, now, suppose I won't sell my place.
What are they going to do?

420
00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:51,645
- That's right, you own your place.
- Sure, I do.

421
00:26:51,729 --> 00:26:53,162
They're going to need it, too.

422
00:26:53,249 --> 00:26:58,004
You bet they will, and it'll take more
than money to make me sell my property.

423
00:26:58,089 --> 00:27:02,446
Go on, get back to work and stop cluttering
up the street, or we'll all be arrested.

424
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:39,925
We sure need more displays this year.
We've got nothing exciting enough.

425
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:44,002
Mr. Sycamore, if I may suggest,
why not the "Russian Revolution"?

426
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:46,286
There's plenty of fireworks there.

427
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:49,964
The "Russian Revolution,"
clash of the colours, the reds and whites.

428
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,239
You've hit on something brilliant.

429
00:27:52,449 --> 00:27:53,928
I don't understand.

430
00:27:54,129 --> 00:27:57,405
A letter for me? Must be some mistake.

431
00:27:57,489 --> 00:27:59,081
It had your name on it.

432
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:00,841
Where is it?

433
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:03,517
- I don't know. Where's Grandpa's letter?
- What, dear?

434
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:06,407
I said, where's that letter
that came for Grandpa last week?

435
00:28:06,489 --> 00:28:07,524
Last week?

436
00:28:07,609 --> 00:28:09,884
I don't know.
I remember seeing the kittens with it.

437
00:28:09,969 --> 00:28:13,325
- Who was it from? Did you notice?
- The United States Government.

438
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:16,958
Really? I wonder what they want.

439
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:20,086
There was one before that
that came from the same people.

440
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:22,524
I can't imagine
what they'd be writing to me for.

441
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:26,807
You could put your printing
to some practical use.

442
00:28:26,889 --> 00:28:28,368
Wait a minute.

443
00:28:28,969 --> 00:28:30,527
I've got another idea.

444
00:28:32,209 --> 00:28:35,645
- That wasn't very loud, was it?
- We can get it louder than that.

445
00:28:35,729 --> 00:28:37,401
What is your idea, Mr. Poppins?

446
00:28:37,489 --> 00:28:39,923
- Well, may I tell it?
- Yes.

447
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,601
Go back to work, Jim. Go back to work.

448
00:28:41,689 --> 00:28:46,001
Why shouldn't Ed print about fireworks
and put it in the candy boxes?

449
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:48,557
That would advertise the Revolution,
wouldn't it?

450
00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:52,278
Say, "Watch for the Revolution.
It's coming soon." How's that?

451
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:55,839
"Watch for the Revolution.
It's coming soon." I can use my big type.

452
00:28:55,929 --> 00:28:59,319
We've got plenty of these Red Flags.
You can write about them.

453
00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:03,163
The Red Flag will sweep the country.
"Get your Red Flag from Sycamore."

454
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:21,125
Ed made up a beautiful song today
by Chopin.

455
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:24,042
Hello, Miss Alice.
Anybody get hurt when the ceiling fell in?

456
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:28,407
"Forks on the left, forks on the left, Rheba"

457
00:29:28,489 --> 00:29:31,401
"Get your Red Flag from Sycamore."
How does it sound, Alice?

458
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:35,763
Gather around, everybody.
It's the town crier.

459
00:29:35,969 --> 00:29:38,164
- The town crier.
- What is it?

460
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:44,682
Gather around, everybody.

461
00:29:44,769 --> 00:29:46,885
Where's Grandpa?
I have an announcement to make.

462
00:29:46,969 --> 00:29:49,403
- What is it?
- A young man is calling for me.

463
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:50,524
Is that all, Alice?

464
00:29:50,609 --> 00:29:54,158
- Maybe he's a special young gentleman.
- You may go to the head of the class.

465
00:29:54,249 --> 00:29:56,809
What's special about him?
Has he got horns or something?

466
00:29:56,889 --> 00:29:59,119
- Maybe he's handsome like Ed.
- I'd better put a tie on.

467
00:29:59,209 --> 00:30:01,086
- Where did you meet him?
- Better set another place.

468
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:04,923
No. Mother, we're going out.
I thought he'd better take you in easy doses.

469
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:09,321
Mother, please don't read any of your
plays to him the first time he comes...

470
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:10,922
...because I like him.

471
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,523
Essie, I wouldn't dance for him
if I were you...

472
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:16,362
...because we're going
to the Monte Carlo Ballet later.

473
00:30:16,449 --> 00:30:21,079
- Does anybody know what time it is?
- It was 5:00 about two hours ago, wasn't it?

474
00:30:21,249 --> 00:30:22,728
Oh, never mind.

475
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:24,800
- Where's Grandpa?
- He's upstairs.

476
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:29,841
Incidentally, the young man's name is Tony
Kirby. Let me know the minute he comes.

477
00:30:30,249 --> 00:30:32,205
Tony Kirby? Say, that's the boss' son.

478
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,244
Really?

479
00:30:33,329 --> 00:30:35,797
Yes, and she told me
they've made him vice president.

480
00:30:35,889 --> 00:30:37,004
Isn't that wonderful?

481
00:30:37,089 --> 00:30:39,523
We could have the wedding right here
in this room.

482
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:41,361
Now, wait a minute, Penny.

483
00:30:41,449 --> 00:30:45,328
- This is the first time he's called for the girl.
- You only called for me once.

484
00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:49,687
- But young folks are different nowadays.
- I don't know. Look at Ed and me.

485
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:52,203
He came to dinner once and just stayed.

486
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:53,278
That's right.

487
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:56,008
The whole Alabama football team
would have stayed, too...

488
00:30:56,089 --> 00:30:59,126
...if you'd had 10 more Essies.
How am I doing, Essie?

489
00:31:05,889 --> 00:31:10,121
Well, there's a lot of fuss being made
about a young man taking you out to dinner.

490
00:31:10,209 --> 00:31:12,404
What's so exciting about that?

491
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:15,841
- A proposal is exciting.
- Proposal!

492
00:31:17,449 --> 00:31:19,804
That's something very different.

493
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,161
Move over there and give me some room.

494
00:31:25,489 --> 00:31:27,764
Stop messing with that package.

495
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:30,239
And let's get down to cases.

496
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:32,122
In love, huh?

497
00:31:33,209 --> 00:31:35,279
Well, well, I...

498
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:37,564
"Well, I," my foot.

499
00:31:37,649 --> 00:31:39,844
Either you are or you aren't.

500
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:42,520
Let me look at your eyes.

501
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:46,641
Yes, of course.

502
00:31:47,289 --> 00:31:49,359
Now, come on, tell me all about it.

503
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:53,125
What kind of a boy is he?
Do you have fun together?

504
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,968
That's no answer to any question.

505
00:31:57,689 --> 00:31:59,008
Is he nice?

506
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:04,599
- Can't even talk about him, can you?
- Not rationally.

507
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:07,328
Who's asking you to be rational?

508
00:32:08,169 --> 00:32:09,284
Listen...

509
00:32:09,849 --> 00:32:13,762
...when I was courting your grandmother,
it took me two years to propose.

510
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,282
You know why?

511
00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:19,959
The moment she'd walk into a room,
my knees buckled.

512
00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:24,964
The blood would rush up into my head
and the walls would start to dance.

513
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:29,317
- Twice I keeled over in a dead faint.
- Why, Grandpa!

514
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:34,244
Yeah, she finally dragged it out of me
when I was in bed with a 104 fever...

515
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:36,399
...and in a state of hysteria.

516
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:41,844
When she accepted, the fever went down
to normal and I hopped out of bed.

517
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:47,283
Why, the case was written up in the medical
journals as the phenomenon of the times.

518
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:51,797
There was nothing phenomenal about it.
I just had it bad, that's all.

519
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:54,164
And I never got over it either.

520
00:32:55,729 --> 00:32:59,404
Right up to the very last,
she couldn't walk into a room...

521
00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:02,885
...without my heart going thump, thump.

522
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:07,481
Oh, you darling.

523
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:11,246
I wish I had known her.

524
00:33:11,809 --> 00:33:13,481
What was she like?

525
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:16,808
Look in there.

526
00:33:22,649 --> 00:33:24,287
This was her room, too.

527
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:29,085
Did you ever notice
the peculiar fragrance in here?

528
00:33:29,889 --> 00:33:32,562
Yes, but I never knew what it was.

529
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:36,844
It's hers. It's never left here.
She hasn't either.

530
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:42,081
I can still hear the tinkle
of her thin little voice...

531
00:33:42,969 --> 00:33:45,199
...and see her eyes laughing.

532
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:51,161
That's the reason I've lived in this house
so many years and could never move out.

533
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:54,602
It would be like moving out on Grandma.

534
00:33:58,689 --> 00:34:02,045
You go on back
to that infernal package of yours.

535
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,565
Now, wait just a minute.

536
00:34:06,649 --> 00:34:07,798
It's for you.

537
00:34:07,889 --> 00:34:09,766
- For me?
- Yes.

538
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:14,241
Why, bless my soul. It's a new harmonica.

539
00:34:14,609 --> 00:34:17,123
- That's for your birthday.
- My birthday?

540
00:34:17,209 --> 00:34:20,884
How do you know when my birthday is?
I don't even know myself.

541
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:24,166
Anytime I get an impulse
to buy you a present, that's your birthday.

542
00:34:24,249 --> 00:34:25,841
Well, thanks, darling.

543
00:34:27,249 --> 00:34:28,477
Grandpa.

544
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:32,565
Grandpa, I hope you like him.

545
00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:36,278
Anybody you fall in love with
is all right with me, Alice.

546
00:34:36,529 --> 00:34:38,884
- You know that.
- Thanks, Grandpa.

547
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:41,164
Incidentally, what's his name?

548
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:43,002
Tony Kirby.

549
00:34:44,009 --> 00:34:47,126
- Not the son of "the" Kirby?
- Yes.

550
00:34:48,529 --> 00:34:50,599
Pretty snooty outfit, aren't they?

551
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:53,681
Yes, but it's all right.
Tony told his mother about it.

552
00:34:53,769 --> 00:34:57,079
It doesn't matter, I'm so happy.
I can't think of anything.

553
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:59,997
You go right on being happy.

554
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:04,438
Yes, I think I'll go downstairs
and take a whack at this.

555
00:35:29,209 --> 00:35:31,723
I wonder where Alice's boyfriend is.

556
00:35:33,209 --> 00:35:35,439
- Isn't that the doorbell?
- Doorbell's ringing.

557
00:35:35,529 --> 00:35:37,440
- Get the doorbell, somebody.
- Want me to go?

558
00:35:37,529 --> 00:35:38,757
Never mind. I'm coming.

559
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:41,488
I'll answer it. It's all right, Rheba. I'll go.

560
00:35:41,569 --> 00:35:43,844
Grandpa, he's here. Alice's young man.

561
00:35:43,929 --> 00:35:46,318
Remember what she said.
Everybody be nice to him.

562
00:35:46,409 --> 00:35:50,004
That's the first time that doorbell's rung
since Halloween.

563
00:35:50,089 --> 00:35:51,522
Pipe, pipe.

564
00:35:54,129 --> 00:35:56,438
- Welcome to our little home.
- How do you do?

565
00:35:56,529 --> 00:36:00,568
I'm Alice's mother. Come right in.
Everybody's dying to know you.

566
00:36:00,769 --> 00:36:02,361
Now, here we are.

567
00:36:02,529 --> 00:36:07,319
That's Grandpa, and that's Alice's father,
her sister and her husband, Ed Carmichael.

568
00:36:07,409 --> 00:36:11,004
- Make yourself at home.
- I'm afraid there's been a mistake.

569
00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:12,966
- How's that?
- My card.

570
00:36:13,729 --> 00:36:16,846
"Wilbur G. Henderson.
Internal Revenue Dept."

571
00:36:17,129 --> 00:36:19,120
Well, for heaven's sake.

572
00:36:19,209 --> 00:36:21,962
- I'm looking for Martin Vanderhof.
- Right here, sir.

573
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:23,801
Excuse me. I've got work to do.

574
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:26,687
- Mind if I sit down?
- Sit right down, sir.

575
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:31,201
Mr. Vanderhof, the government wants
to talk to you about a matter of income tax.

576
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:32,404
Income tax?

577
00:36:32,489 --> 00:36:36,960
- Is that Mr. Kirby, Mother?
- No, it's an internal something or other.

578
00:36:37,889 --> 00:36:38,958
Pardon me.

579
00:36:39,689 --> 00:36:43,887
Mr. Vanderhof, we've written many letters
about this, but we've received no reply.

580
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:47,598
That's what those letters were.
Did you hear that, Penny?

581
00:36:47,689 --> 00:36:52,046
- This is the party that's been writing to me.
- It's not me, Mr. Vanderhof.

582
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:54,359
You see, the Internal Revenue Office...

583
00:36:55,169 --> 00:36:57,763
- That must be him now.
- Doorbell's ringing again.

584
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,919
- I heard the doorbell.
- I'm on it.

585
00:37:00,129 --> 00:37:01,323
Want me to go?

586
00:37:01,609 --> 00:37:03,042
Pipe, pipe.

587
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:10,919
How do you do, Mr. Kirby? Come right in.

588
00:37:11,009 --> 00:37:13,887
- Thank you.
- We've been expecting you.

589
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:16,758
- You are Mr. Kirby, aren't you?
- Oh, yes.

590
00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:20,080
Thank heavens. Here he is.
This is really Mr. Kirby.

591
00:37:20,169 --> 00:37:24,560
This is Alice's father, and her grandfather,
and her sister Essie, and Essie's husband.

592
00:37:24,649 --> 00:37:27,561
- Won't you sit down, Mr. Kirby?
- Yes.

593
00:37:33,449 --> 00:37:37,681
- Mother, is that Mr. Kirby?
- Yes, dear. He's lovely.

594
00:37:38,009 --> 00:37:39,886
I'll be right down.

595
00:37:39,969 --> 00:37:42,722
- She'll be right down.
- Thank you very much.

596
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,802
- Do y'all play football?
- A little, yeah.

597
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:53,285
You are awful young to be a vice president.

598
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:58,204
You know what that means, vice president.
An office with my name on the door.

599
00:37:59,689 --> 00:38:01,247
Is that all?

600
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:04,446
I have a secretary.
A very lovely secretary, too.

601
00:38:04,529 --> 00:38:06,520
Isn't that sweet, Ed?

602
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:09,929
How about salary?
Don't you get any salary?

603
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:13,283
A little. More than I'm worth, I'm afraid.

604
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:16,967
I beg your pardon.

605
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:20,567
I suppose you're ready
to settle down and get married now?

606
00:38:20,649 --> 00:38:23,447
Come now, Penny. I'm sure Mr. Kirby
knows his own mind.

607
00:38:23,529 --> 00:38:25,247
You mustn't rush him, Mother.

608
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:29,959
All I meant was, he's bound to get married,
and suppose the wrong girl gets him.

609
00:38:30,649 --> 00:38:32,480
Mr. Vanderhof, I've got to be going.

610
00:38:32,569 --> 00:38:35,527
Oh, too bad.
I'm sorry you can't stay to dinner.

611
00:38:35,609 --> 00:38:36,644
Drop in again.

612
00:38:36,729 --> 00:38:39,562
If you don't mind,
I'd like to settle my business before I go.

613
00:38:39,649 --> 00:38:41,719
He's selling something for the government.

614
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:43,879
What can I do for you?

615
00:38:44,009 --> 00:38:46,648
Mr. Vanderhof, our records show...

616
00:38:47,049 --> 00:38:49,517
...that you have never paid any income tax.

617
00:38:49,649 --> 00:38:50,718
That's right.

618
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:53,118
- Why not?
- I don't believe in it.

619
00:38:57,129 --> 00:38:59,085
You don't believe in it?

620
00:38:59,609 --> 00:39:02,965
Mr. Sycamore, I can't get these things
to go off. Look.

621
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,359
- Not now, Mr. DePinna.
- No. Not now. Grandpa's busy.

622
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:10,484
- Mr. Kirby. Mr. DePinna.
- How do you do?

623
00:39:10,569 --> 00:39:13,720
Of course, didn't I read something
about your father?

624
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,527
He was indicted or something, wasn't he?

625
00:39:15,609 --> 00:39:18,362
No, he just testified
before the Securities Commission.

626
00:39:18,449 --> 00:39:20,246
- I thought the cops had got him.
- No.

627
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:23,207
- Come along, Mr. DePinna. Come on.
- See here, Mr. Vanderhof.

628
00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:27,885
Whether you believe it or not, you owe
the government 22 years back income taxes.

629
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:31,279
Wait a minute. That's too far back.
That's outlawed, ain't it?

630
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,519
- What's your name?
- What's the difference?

631
00:39:33,609 --> 00:39:35,839
- Did you ever file an income tax return?
- No, sir.

632
00:39:35,929 --> 00:39:39,399
- What was your income last year?
- I don't know, about $85, wasn't it?

633
00:39:39,489 --> 00:39:40,638
I don't know.

634
00:39:43,529 --> 00:39:47,317
Now, Mr. Vanderhof, that's a serious thing,
not filing an income tax return.

635
00:39:47,409 --> 00:39:50,242
Now, just suppose I do pay you this money.

636
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:54,447
Mind you, I don't say that I'm going to,
but just for the sake of argument...

637
00:39:54,689 --> 00:39:56,680
...what's the government
going to do with it?

638
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:00,045
- What do you mean?
- What do I get for my money?

639
00:40:00,249 --> 00:40:04,845
For instance, if I go into a department store
and buy something...

640
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:07,968
...there it is. I can see it.

641
00:40:08,529 --> 00:40:10,565
But what are they going to give me?

642
00:40:10,649 --> 00:40:13,482
The government gives you everything.
It protects you.

643
00:40:13,569 --> 00:40:14,604
From what?

644
00:40:14,689 --> 00:40:18,728
Invasion. How do you think the government
will keep up the Army and Navy...

645
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:21,369
...with all those battleships?
- Battleships?

646
00:40:22,009 --> 00:40:26,048
Last time we used battleships
was in the Spanish-American War...

647
00:40:26,129 --> 00:40:30,327
...and what did we get out of that?
Cuba. And we gave that back.

648
00:40:30,529 --> 00:40:33,805
Why, I wouldn't mind paying
for something sensible.

649
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:37,962
Something sensible! What about Congress
and the Supreme Court and the President?

650
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:42,679
- We've got to pay them, don't we?
- Not with my money, no, sir.

651
00:40:43,689 --> 00:40:46,647
Now, wait a minute.
I didn't come here to argue with you.

652
00:40:46,729 --> 00:40:47,957
Hello, everybody.

653
00:40:48,049 --> 00:40:49,368
- Hello, Tony.
- Hello, Alice.

654
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:51,963
- Is everybody acquainted with everybody?
- Yes, indeed.

655
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:55,121
We've had a most delightful talk
about love and marriage.

656
00:40:55,529 --> 00:40:57,406
I'm sorry. I tried to hurry.

657
00:40:57,809 --> 00:40:59,037
Look, Mr. Vanderhof.

658
00:40:59,129 --> 00:41:03,441
You haven't paid any income tax,
and you've got to pay it.

659
00:41:04,649 --> 00:41:08,039
- What was that?
- I said you've got to pay it.

660
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:11,002
Well, you've got to show me.

661
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:14,208
We don't have to show you. I just told you.

662
00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:18,328
Who's going to pay for all those buildings
in Washington and interstate commerce?

663
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,728
And the Constitution?

664
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:22,801
The Constitution has been paid for
years ago.

665
00:41:22,929 --> 00:41:27,207
And as for interstate commerce...
What is interstate commerce anyway?

666
00:41:27,769 --> 00:41:31,159
There are 48 states, see?

667
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:33,804
If it wasn't for the interstate commerce...

668
00:41:33,889 --> 00:41:37,564
...nothing could go
from one state to another, see?

669
00:41:38,209 --> 00:41:40,643
Why not? Have they got fences?

670
00:41:44,489 --> 00:41:47,720
No, they haven't got fences.
They've got laws.

671
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:50,960
Holy smokes!
I never ran across anything like this before.

672
00:41:52,569 --> 00:41:56,118
I might pay about $75...

673
00:41:56,329 --> 00:41:58,479
...but it isn't worth a cent more.

674
00:41:58,929 --> 00:42:02,239
You'll pay every cent just like anybody else.
Now, listen to me.

675
00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:04,320
You'll go to jail if you don't pay. That's law.

676
00:42:04,409 --> 00:42:07,685
If you think you're bigger than that,
you've got another thing coming.

677
00:42:07,769 --> 00:42:09,327
You're the same as anybody else...

678
00:42:09,409 --> 00:42:12,765
...and the sooner you get that
through your head, the better.

679
00:42:13,409 --> 00:42:14,808
Holy smokes!

680
00:42:28,609 --> 00:42:31,407
My father makes fireworks in the cellar.

681
00:42:33,169 --> 00:42:35,285
- How did that sound to you?
- Pretty good.

682
00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:36,563
Thanks.

683
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:38,646
I guess we'd better be going, Tony.

684
00:42:38,729 --> 00:42:42,005
- Say, he was pretty mad, wasn't he?
- He certainly was.

685
00:42:42,089 --> 00:42:45,081
That might get you into trouble,
Mr. Vanderhof.

686
00:42:45,169 --> 00:42:48,525
No, not me. I was only having fun with him.

687
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:50,362
I don't owe the government a cent.

688
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:53,488
- We're going. Good night, everybody.
- Good night.

689
00:42:53,649 --> 00:42:56,641
- Hello, everybody.
- Hello, Kolenkhov.

690
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:02,964
You know, never have I seen you look
more magnificent.

691
00:43:03,049 --> 00:43:06,519
Thank you. Mr. Kirby, this is Mr. Kolenkhov,
Essie's dancing teacher.

692
00:43:06,609 --> 00:43:10,124
- I don't know you, but you are a lucky man.
- Thank you.

693
00:43:10,209 --> 00:43:13,485
- I practiced today, Mr. Kolenkhov.
- My Pavlova.

694
00:43:15,489 --> 00:43:20,279
- Grandpa, I am in time for dinner, no?
- You are in time for dinner, yes.

695
00:43:20,569 --> 00:43:24,005
Goodbye, Mr. Kolenkhov.
We're going to the Monte Carlo Ballet.

696
00:43:24,089 --> 00:43:26,000
The Monte Carlo Ballet?

697
00:43:26,569 --> 00:43:27,888
It stinks.

698
00:43:31,049 --> 00:43:32,641
Good night, everybody.

699
00:43:32,729 --> 00:43:35,163
- Good night.
- Good night.

700
00:43:35,689 --> 00:43:36,963
The Monte Carlo Ballet!

701
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:38,562
Dinner's ready.

702
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:44,241
My little Rheba,
what would I do without my angel?

703
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:47,560
Only three shirts. They must be washed
by your beautiful hands...

704
00:43:47,649 --> 00:43:49,799
...and would you sew on two buttons?

705
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:54,003
Monte Carlo Ballet! Sergei Diaghilev!
Then you have ballet.

706
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:56,125
Quiet, please.

707
00:43:56,769 --> 00:43:57,997
Quiet.

708
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:01,078
Well, sir. Here we are again.

709
00:44:01,609 --> 00:44:06,729
We've been getting on good for a while,
and we're certainly much obliged.

710
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:11,601
Looks like Alice is going to get married,
and I think she'll be very happy...

711
00:44:11,689 --> 00:44:15,477
...because we just met the boy you sent her
and he looks fine.

712
00:44:16,609 --> 00:44:21,399
Remember, all we ask is to go along
the way we are and keep our health...

713
00:44:22,449 --> 00:44:26,488
...as far as anything else is concerned,
we leave that up to you.

714
00:44:26,569 --> 00:44:27,763
Thank you.

715
00:44:28,449 --> 00:44:31,486
Mr. Kolenkhov,
did you bring me any Russian stamps?

716
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:35,403
No. Nobody writes to me. They're all dead.

717
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:43,688
I was just thinking about that family
of yours.

718
00:44:43,969 --> 00:44:48,042
Living with them is like living in a world
that Walt Disney might have thought of.

719
00:44:48,129 --> 00:44:50,324
Everybody does just as he pleases,
doesn't he?

720
00:44:50,409 --> 00:44:54,118
Yes, Grandpa started it.
He suddenly quit business one day.

721
00:44:54,209 --> 00:44:57,645
He started up in the elevator, came
right down again and never went back.

722
00:44:57,729 --> 00:45:01,005
He could have been a rich man,
but he said he wasn't having any fun.

723
00:45:01,089 --> 00:45:02,408
That's wonderful.

724
00:45:02,689 --> 00:45:06,238
Then he started collecting stamps
because that's what he liked best.

725
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:08,843
You know, he gets paid
just to appraise collections.

726
00:45:08,929 --> 00:45:11,284
- He's an expert.
- That's marvellous.

727
00:45:11,369 --> 00:45:15,885
My dad, he makes fireworks
because he never grew up, I guess.

728
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:18,923
And, Mother.
Do you know why Mother writes plays?

729
00:45:19,089 --> 00:45:21,603
She likes literature and good books.

730
00:45:21,689 --> 00:45:26,365
No, because eight years ago, a typewriter
was delivered to the house by mistake.

731
00:45:26,449 --> 00:45:30,522
If it had been a plough,
she'd have taken up farming, huh?

732
00:45:30,609 --> 00:45:32,918
I'm sure of it, if she'd liked it.

733
00:45:34,609 --> 00:45:39,160
This is making conversation, but weren't we
supposed to go to the ballet?

734
00:45:39,249 --> 00:45:42,446
Yes. Well, let's see.

735
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:46,599
Yes, second seat over, miss.

736
00:45:54,409 --> 00:45:57,526
I can talk and I can listen, or I can just sit.

737
00:45:57,689 --> 00:46:01,159
- What will you have?
- Well, I think I'd like to have this first.

738
00:46:13,929 --> 00:46:17,319
- Mr. Moody, what are you thinking about?
- Me?

739
00:46:19,529 --> 00:46:22,839
That family of yours.
Boy, they knocked me for a loop.

740
00:46:23,289 --> 00:46:24,483
I don't know.

741
00:46:24,569 --> 00:46:28,881
It just seems like, in their own way,
they've found what everybody's looking for.

742
00:46:29,609 --> 00:46:32,601
People spend their whole lives
building castles in the air...

743
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:35,920
...and then nothing ever comes of them.
Wonder why that is?

744
00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:38,328
It takes courage.

745
00:46:39,729 --> 00:46:41,799
Everybody's afraid to live.

746
00:46:42,129 --> 00:46:45,087
You ought to hear Grandpa on that subject.
You know, he says...

747
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:48,002
...most people nowadays are run by fear,
fear of what they eat...

748
00:46:48,089 --> 00:46:51,684
...fear of what they drink,
fear of their jobs, their future, their health.

749
00:46:51,769 --> 00:46:54,329
They're scared to save money,
and scared to spend it.

750
00:46:54,409 --> 00:46:56,365
You know what his pet aversion is?

751
00:46:56,449 --> 00:47:00,488
People who commercialise on fear,
scare you to death to sell you something...

752
00:47:00,569 --> 00:47:02,844
...you don't need.
- Yeah, I agree with him.

753
00:47:02,929 --> 00:47:06,808
So he kind of taught all of us
not to be afraid of anything...

754
00:47:07,329 --> 00:47:11,163
...and to do what we want to do,
and, well, it's kind of fun, anyway.

755
00:47:11,249 --> 00:47:14,127
Yeah, that's it, but that takes courage.

756
00:47:14,209 --> 00:47:17,406
Especially that
do-what-you-want-to-do department.

757
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:22,205
I remember in college,
another guy and I had an idea.

758
00:47:24,569 --> 00:47:28,562
- Do you mind if I talk about myself?
- If you don't, I will.

759
00:47:33,089 --> 00:47:35,000
This guy and I had this idea.

760
00:47:37,849 --> 00:47:41,364
We wanted to find out...

761
00:47:41,449 --> 00:47:43,405
...what made grass grow green.

762
00:47:44,609 --> 00:47:48,284
That sounds silly, but that's the biggest
research problem in the world today.

763
00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:49,882
I'll tell you why.

764
00:47:50,529 --> 00:47:54,124
Because there's a tiny little engine
in the green...

765
00:47:54,209 --> 00:47:58,919
...of this grass and in the green of the trees
that has the mysterious gift...

766
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:03,878
...of being able to take energy
from the rays of the sun and store it up.

767
00:48:04,969 --> 00:48:09,679
You see, that's how the heat, and power
in coal, and oil, and wood, is stored up.

768
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:15,081
We thought if we could find the secret...

769
00:48:15,169 --> 00:48:17,763
...of all those millions of little engines...

770
00:48:18,089 --> 00:48:23,038
...in this green stuff, we can make big ones
and then we could take all the power...

771
00:48:23,129 --> 00:48:26,326
...we could ever need
right from the sun's rays. See?

772
00:48:26,569 --> 00:48:29,481
- That's wonderful. I never knew that.
- Yeah.

773
00:48:30,289 --> 00:48:32,439
We worked and worked on it...

774
00:48:33,809 --> 00:48:37,324
...day and night. We got so excited about it
we forgot to sleep.

775
00:48:38,089 --> 00:48:41,206
If we'd make just one little discovery...

776
00:48:42,649 --> 00:48:44,605
...we'd walk on air for days.

777
00:48:46,169 --> 00:48:48,842
Yeah, then what?

778
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:52,880
Then we left school...

779
00:48:54,249 --> 00:48:56,479
...and now he's selling automobiles...

780
00:48:57,769 --> 00:49:00,522
...and I'm in some strange thing
called banking.

781
00:49:03,249 --> 00:49:05,399
I saw him a couple of weeks ago.

782
00:49:06,489 --> 00:49:08,719
Poor guy. Bob Smith is his name.

783
00:49:10,289 --> 00:49:13,884
Got all excited again,
wanted to talk about nothing else.

784
00:49:15,769 --> 00:49:16,963
And?

785
00:49:18,929 --> 00:49:22,239
He's married, and his wife just had a baby.

786
00:49:23,689 --> 00:49:26,999
Didn't think it was fair to gamble
with the future.

787
00:49:29,289 --> 00:49:32,326
Anyway, that's his excuse
for lack of courage.

788
00:49:34,369 --> 00:49:36,724
Don't say it. What's my excuse?

789
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:42,648
The Kirbys have been bankers
for 9,000 years...

790
00:49:43,969 --> 00:49:45,846
...and the line just can't be broken.

791
00:49:45,929 --> 00:49:49,683
That's been pounded into my head
until I have softening of the brain.

792
00:49:51,929 --> 00:49:53,567
That's my excuse.

793
00:49:54,569 --> 00:49:57,879
Tony, that's kind of silly,
you're pretty young to...

794
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:02,608
I resent what you said about your brain.
I think it's beautiful.

795
00:50:05,209 --> 00:50:06,164
You do?

796
00:50:07,049 --> 00:50:08,164
You don't say.

797
00:50:08,609 --> 00:50:13,729
That's probably the first thing you noticed
about me, that you liked my colossal brain.

798
00:50:15,489 --> 00:50:19,118
No, it was the back of your head.

799
00:50:19,889 --> 00:50:21,038
- My head?
- Yes.

800
00:50:21,329 --> 00:50:23,718
- Nothing but a bump back there.
- The shape of it.

801
00:50:23,809 --> 00:50:25,925
What happened when I turned around?

802
00:50:26,969 --> 00:50:29,437
I figured I would have to get used to that.

803
00:50:29,529 --> 00:50:31,645
You figured?

804
00:50:32,049 --> 00:50:35,086
I figured it might not take very long,
but I figured I'd just...

805
00:50:35,169 --> 00:50:38,479
- You just figured that you'd get used to that.
- Yes.

806
00:50:39,929 --> 00:50:42,284
- I'm glad you figured.
- Yes.

807
00:50:47,249 --> 00:50:50,446
What do you say, mister?
Want to learn to do the Big Apple?

808
00:50:50,529 --> 00:50:53,521
- That's against the law, you know?
- So is necking.

809
00:50:55,329 --> 00:50:57,240
- How much is it?
- Ten cents.

810
00:50:57,329 --> 00:50:59,604
Wouldn't do it for a nickel, would you?

811
00:51:03,009 --> 00:51:04,044
I get it.

812
00:51:04,129 --> 00:51:06,324
- Can you do the Big Apple?
- No, can you?

813
00:51:06,409 --> 00:51:07,239
No.

814
00:51:07,329 --> 00:51:10,639
All right. I'll take a chance.
There you are. What do we do?

815
00:51:10,729 --> 00:51:12,765
You just watch them. It's a lead pipe cinch.

816
00:51:12,849 --> 00:51:16,239
Okay, Red. You and Snoopy.
Make it hot. Let her go.

817
00:51:17,529 --> 00:51:19,440
You just watch them.

818
00:51:19,529 --> 00:51:20,564
Oh, yeah!

819
00:51:25,329 --> 00:51:27,524
Okay. Dorothy, you take this man.

820
00:51:32,409 --> 00:51:34,206
- Come on, wiggle.
- Wiggle?

821
00:51:34,289 --> 00:51:35,404
Point your toe.

822
00:51:35,489 --> 00:51:37,002
- Which toe?
- That one.

823
00:51:40,729 --> 00:51:42,242
Come on, wiggle!

824
00:51:42,889 --> 00:51:45,357
It's not good unless you wiggle.

825
00:51:45,449 --> 00:51:47,599
That's right. Wiggle.

826
00:51:48,449 --> 00:51:50,167
- Swell.
- Swell.

827
00:51:50,249 --> 00:51:51,477
The winner.

828
00:51:53,209 --> 00:51:54,961
- Come on.
- Take it easy, Alice.

829
00:51:55,049 --> 00:51:55,959
You ready?

830
00:51:56,049 --> 00:51:57,641
- You all set now?
- Yep.

831
00:51:59,769 --> 00:52:01,646
Shuffle, and shuffle, and move around.

832
00:52:01,729 --> 00:52:06,439
Break, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, step.

833
00:52:07,009 --> 00:52:09,159
Come on, sister, loosen up. You're too stiff.

834
00:52:09,249 --> 00:52:11,444
Yeah, Alice. Loosen up. That's it.

835
00:52:14,009 --> 00:52:16,079
Very good. The new champion.

836
00:52:18,209 --> 00:52:21,485
All right. Grab your partners.

837
00:52:25,129 --> 00:52:27,962
Wonder whatever happened
to Astaire and Rogers.

838
00:52:28,649 --> 00:52:30,321
Jiggers, the cops.

839
00:52:47,009 --> 00:52:48,727
Pretty swank.

840
00:53:01,089 --> 00:53:03,159
Good evening, Mr. Kirby. Good evening.

841
00:53:03,249 --> 00:53:05,604
We seem to be attracting a little attention.

842
00:53:05,689 --> 00:53:08,601
Oh, no. It isn't you they are watching.
It's Lord Melville.

843
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:10,008
- Lord Melville?
- Yes.

844
00:53:10,089 --> 00:53:12,887
- Where is he?
- At your table with your father.

845
00:53:15,569 --> 00:53:17,924
Tony, don't ask me to go over there
because I won't.

846
00:53:18,009 --> 00:53:19,965
No, Alice. It will be all right.

847
00:53:20,049 --> 00:53:23,246
I want you to meet a four-star blueblood.
Come on.

848
00:53:31,329 --> 00:53:32,284
Good evening.

849
00:53:32,369 --> 00:53:34,405
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, Tony.

850
00:53:34,489 --> 00:53:35,808
No, please.

851
00:53:35,889 --> 00:53:37,038
Please be seated.

852
00:53:37,129 --> 00:53:40,201
My son Tony, and Miss...

853
00:53:40,289 --> 00:53:42,086
- Alice Sycamore.
- Sycamore, of course.

854
00:53:42,169 --> 00:53:45,400
I never could remember names.
Lord and Lady Melville.

855
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:47,605
- How do you do?
- How do you do, sir?

856
00:53:48,009 --> 00:53:49,681
Governor Leach and Mrs. Leach.

857
00:53:49,769 --> 00:53:51,248
How do you do?

858
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,044
Nice party.

859
00:53:54,129 --> 00:53:56,768
- A couple of chairs, please.
- No, a table for two.

860
00:53:56,849 --> 00:53:59,124
- Yes, sir.
- Just want a table for two.

861
00:53:59,649 --> 00:54:02,322
- What do you have there, sir? A new game?
- Oh, no.

862
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:05,082
I was just seeing
how far I could trace my family tree.

863
00:54:05,169 --> 00:54:06,761
Your mother was interested.

864
00:54:06,849 --> 00:54:10,239
I thought all that family tree stuff
went out with the buffalo.

865
00:54:10,729 --> 00:54:12,208
How absurd, Tony.

866
00:54:12,289 --> 00:54:15,520
America is more and more conscious
of its background.

867
00:54:15,609 --> 00:54:18,726
It cost me $5,000 last year
to trace my family tree.

868
00:54:22,289 --> 00:54:25,122
And you, Miss Sycamore.
Have you a family tree?

869
00:54:25,209 --> 00:54:26,688
- Me?
- Yes.

870
00:54:27,609 --> 00:54:30,840
My dear sir, don't you know
that a sycamore is a tree?

871
00:54:35,889 --> 00:54:37,038
No comment.

872
00:54:38,289 --> 00:54:39,517
Good night.

873
00:54:42,369 --> 00:54:43,438
Good night.

874
00:54:48,049 --> 00:54:49,118
Good night.

875
00:55:02,849 --> 00:55:06,808
Boy, there are going to be some questions
asked about my family, and their tree.

876
00:55:06,889 --> 00:55:09,881
- I can just feel it.
- Good, I know all the answers.

877
00:55:09,969 --> 00:55:13,518
If we're honest now, we're going
to save ourselves a lot of embarrassment.

878
00:55:13,609 --> 00:55:15,884
Tony, I want you to invite them to my house.

879
00:55:15,969 --> 00:55:18,324
So that's what has been on your mind?

880
00:55:18,409 --> 00:55:22,607
It will give them an opportunity
to meet everyone, and then they'll know us.

881
00:55:22,689 --> 00:55:25,567
All right. I think I can arrange that.

882
00:55:25,649 --> 00:55:29,164
Let's see, I can put each member
of your family in a separate cage...

883
00:55:29,249 --> 00:55:32,924
...and then put tags on them and the Kirbys
can march up and down like this.

884
00:55:33,009 --> 00:55:35,967
Do you think I'm going
to put you on exhibition like a circus?

885
00:55:36,049 --> 00:55:38,722
- I don't mind.
- I do. I'm just not going to bother.

886
00:55:38,809 --> 00:55:40,208
We've got to.

887
00:55:40,289 --> 00:55:43,201
To them, I'll always be
just a stenographer who...

888
00:55:47,489 --> 00:55:51,198
- Look at your mother. She is still staring.
- Who wouldn't stare at you?

889
00:55:51,289 --> 00:55:53,325
Tony, promise me you'll do it.

890
00:55:55,329 --> 00:55:59,208
You know, every time I think how lucky I am,
I feel like screaming.

891
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:01,325
Tony, please promise you'll invite them.

892
00:56:01,409 --> 00:56:04,685
- I feel a scream coming on.
- We'll have to face it sooner or later.

893
00:56:04,769 --> 00:56:07,283
It's starting in my toes.
Sort of a tingling sensation.

894
00:56:07,369 --> 00:56:10,042
- Ask them for Wednesday.
- It's creeping up around my knees.

895
00:56:10,129 --> 00:56:12,438
It's going up my legs.
Travelling faster and faster.

896
00:56:12,529 --> 00:56:16,568
- You're not really going to scream.
- It's in my stomach now. It's got me.

897
00:56:16,649 --> 00:56:17,798
Not with your mother here.

898
00:56:17,889 --> 00:56:21,165
- It's going up. It's all over my body now.
- Please don't.

899
00:56:21,249 --> 00:56:24,480
It's in my throat. It's fighting to get out.

900
00:56:24,569 --> 00:56:26,719
I can't hold it back any longer. Here it goes.

901
00:56:26,809 --> 00:56:27,639
No!

902
00:56:37,449 --> 00:56:38,677
What happened?

903
00:56:38,769 --> 00:56:41,761
- A mouse went right past there.
- A mouse in this place?

904
00:56:41,849 --> 00:56:45,319
- A rat that long with hair on it.
- A rat with hair on it?

905
00:56:45,409 --> 00:56:48,003
There were about six of them.
Six or seven of them?

906
00:56:48,089 --> 00:56:49,727
- Where?
- Where?

907
00:56:49,809 --> 00:56:51,925
Right under that table.

908
00:56:54,729 --> 00:56:56,321
There they go!

909
00:57:16,889 --> 00:57:18,959
Mr. Kirby, I'm terribly sorry, terribly sorry.

910
00:57:19,049 --> 00:57:21,438
It's all right, Henri.
Buy yourself some mousetraps.

911
00:57:21,529 --> 00:57:22,564
Thank you.

912
00:57:25,929 --> 00:57:27,408
Are you ready, Anthony?

913
00:57:27,489 --> 00:57:30,128
Are you serious about taking me
on this slumming tour?

914
00:57:30,209 --> 00:57:33,565
The more we fight him, the more he'll resist.
It's the only thing to do.

915
00:57:33,649 --> 00:57:36,322
Pretend, at least,
that we are willing to be reasonable.

916
00:57:36,409 --> 00:57:38,798
She's probably
from some dull, middle-class family.

917
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:43,167
As soon as Tony sees us together,
he'll realise how impossible the situation is.

918
00:57:43,249 --> 00:57:45,763
Yeah. That, I take it,
is what is known as being subtle.

919
00:57:45,849 --> 00:57:46,838
Yes.

920
00:57:54,969 --> 00:57:57,039
Come here a minute, Donald.

921
00:58:00,929 --> 00:58:05,161
Donald, look and see if you see a man
standing in front of the house.

922
00:58:05,609 --> 00:58:07,247
What are you so excited about?

923
00:58:07,329 --> 00:58:11,163
There's a man been following me lately
when I'm out delivering candy.

924
00:58:11,249 --> 00:58:13,240
Maybe he wants a piece of candy.

925
00:58:15,049 --> 00:58:17,483
What's the matter, Alice? Are you jealous?

926
00:58:17,569 --> 00:58:21,039
- Do you want to break your leg, too?
- I got to do it without holding on.

927
00:58:21,129 --> 00:58:22,357
Let me have a piece of paper.

928
00:58:22,449 --> 00:58:25,486
We ought to make a list out for Rheba
for tomorrow night.

929
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:28,447
Let Rheba have the kitchen
all day tomorrow, won't you?

930
00:58:28,529 --> 00:58:29,848
- She'll need it.
- Yes, Alice.

931
00:58:29,929 --> 00:58:31,840
That's why I'm making
my Love Dreams now, so I'll be way ahead.

932
00:58:31,929 --> 00:58:34,966
Thank you.
Mother, tomorrow, before the Kirbys come...

933
00:58:35,049 --> 00:58:39,486
...let them put everything down in the cellar,
the typewriter, the kittens, the vibraphone...

934
00:58:39,569 --> 00:58:43,448
The Kirbys are certainly going
to get the wrong impression of this house.

935
00:58:43,769 --> 00:58:46,329
Guess I'd better have cocktails at 7:00.

936
00:58:46,649 --> 00:58:48,879
I wonder if I ought to let Rheba
cook the dinner.

937
00:58:48,969 --> 00:58:50,766
Stop worrying, Alice.

938
00:58:51,209 --> 00:58:55,122
From what I've seen of the boy,
the Kirbys are probably very nice...

939
00:58:55,209 --> 00:58:59,282
...and if things aren't too elaborate
tomorrow night, why, it will be all right, too.

940
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:03,328
Darling, I'm not trying to impress them,
or pretend we're anything that we aren't.

941
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:06,082
We'll do everything we can
to make it a nice party.

942
00:59:06,169 --> 00:59:08,603
- Will you, Mother?
- Of course, dear.

943
00:59:11,889 --> 00:59:14,562
- Does Richard know where to go?
- Yes, I told him, Dad.

944
00:59:14,649 --> 00:59:17,686
Why did it have to be tonight?
I have more important things to do.

945
00:59:17,769 --> 00:59:21,079
I didn't want to trouble you,
but Alice wanted you to meet her family.

946
00:59:21,169 --> 00:59:24,127
There you are, Anthony.
She may be very nice after all.

947
00:59:24,209 --> 00:59:26,643
Why, Mother, you're breaking down.

948
00:59:26,809 --> 00:59:31,041
Heaven only knows what they'll have to eat.
You know how sensitive my stomach is.

949
00:59:31,129 --> 00:59:32,608
Do we have to go there for dinner?

950
00:59:32,689 --> 00:59:37,001
- There are sure to be some vegetables.
- Probably raw. Mine have got to be cooked.

951
00:59:37,249 --> 00:59:40,924
Mrs. Sycamore, look what I found.

952
00:59:41,609 --> 00:59:44,885
Oh, it's my painting of you
as the discus thrower.

953
00:59:44,969 --> 00:59:47,722
- Look, Grandpa.
- You remember, it was over eight years ago.

954
00:59:47,809 --> 00:59:51,518
I meant to finish it, then I got started
on my plays and I never painted again.

955
00:59:51,609 --> 00:59:54,840
It's just as well.
I'd have been the next one to strip.

956
00:59:54,929 --> 00:59:57,727
I wish you would finish it.
I'd kind of like to have it.

957
00:59:57,809 --> 00:59:59,561
Would you? Perhaps I will.

958
00:59:59,849 --> 01:00:02,966
Right tonight. Is the costume
and the easel still in the cellar?

959
01:00:03,049 --> 01:00:04,277
Sure. I saved them.

960
01:00:04,369 --> 01:00:07,998
You go and get them, Mr. DePinna.
I'll find my palette and brushes.

961
01:00:08,089 --> 01:00:11,320
- Hello, everybody.
- Hello, Kolenkhov.

962
01:00:11,409 --> 01:00:15,084
- Grandpa, I am in time for dinner, no?
- Of course you are.

963
01:00:15,169 --> 01:00:17,319
That is why I like to come...

964
01:00:18,249 --> 01:00:19,477
What is that?

965
01:00:19,609 --> 01:00:23,238
That's a picture of Mr. DePinna.
Penny painted it.

966
01:00:24,449 --> 01:00:25,848
It stinks.

967
01:00:27,929 --> 01:00:30,079
I'm sorry to keep you, Mr. Kolenkhov.

968
01:00:30,169 --> 01:00:33,286
My Love Dreams were on the stove.
I'll get into my dancing clothes.

969
01:00:33,369 --> 01:00:36,406
My Pavlova, you are like a beautiful swan.

970
01:00:41,169 --> 01:00:43,763
Essie making any progress, Kolenkhov?

971
01:00:45,089 --> 01:00:47,523
Confidentially, she stinks.

972
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:50,560
As long as she's having fun.

973
01:00:54,409 --> 01:00:56,969
My, it feels nice
to get into my art things again.

974
01:00:57,049 --> 01:01:00,962
- You're a breath of Paris, Madame Sycamore.
- Thank you.

975
01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:08,042
It happened again.
A man followed me every place I went.

976
01:01:08,129 --> 01:01:10,563
I'm ready, Mrs. Sycamore.
Where are you going to work?

977
01:01:10,649 --> 01:01:12,321
- Right here.
- All right, Grandpa?

978
01:01:12,409 --> 01:01:15,560
I'd forgotten that costume was so classical.

979
01:01:24,369 --> 01:01:27,361
Your expression, Mr. DePinna. There.

980
01:01:32,969 --> 01:01:34,607
I'm ready now, Mr. Kolenkhov.

981
01:01:34,689 --> 01:01:37,681
Good. We go to work.
We'll roll up the carpet, Ed.

982
01:01:47,849 --> 01:01:50,841
- I got a new piece. Can I play it?
- There are no new pieces.

983
01:01:50,929 --> 01:01:54,126
Play that Brahms Hungarian dance.
I feel so good.

984
01:01:54,209 --> 01:01:57,042
Life is running around inside of me
like a squirrel.

985
01:01:57,129 --> 01:01:59,199
Well, my Pavlova, now we work.

986
01:01:59,289 --> 01:02:02,725
Kolenkhov always said
art is 110 percent sweat.

987
01:02:03,649 --> 01:02:04,718
That is better.

988
01:02:04,809 --> 01:02:06,288
- Ready, Eddie?
- Yes, sir.

989
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:22,598
Pirouette.

990
01:02:34,889 --> 01:02:36,607
Faster, Eddie.

991
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,806
Mrs. Sycamore, please.

992
01:02:49,209 --> 01:02:50,927
Mr. And Mrs. Kirby.

993
01:02:55,049 --> 01:02:56,767
- Faster.
- Mrs. Sycamore.

994
01:03:02,089 --> 01:03:05,240
- Mrs. Sycamore.
- Go away, Rheba. I'm busy now.

995
01:03:05,329 --> 01:03:09,322
- Pull your stomach in a little, Mr. DePinna.
- I know, but, Mrs. Sycamore...

996
01:03:09,529 --> 01:03:10,962
Oh, my.

997
01:03:18,649 --> 01:03:19,638
Oh, darling.

998
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:22,448
Please, all those.

999
01:03:24,049 --> 01:03:25,323
Here, dear.

1000
01:03:26,929 --> 01:03:28,078
Take that.

1001
01:03:32,689 --> 01:03:34,805
- Are we too early?
- I'll say.

1002
01:03:37,729 --> 01:03:39,481
It's perfectly all right.

1003
01:03:39,569 --> 01:03:42,561
Why, of course. Only we thought it was
to be tomorrow night.

1004
01:03:42,649 --> 01:03:45,163
- Tomorrow night?
- That's funny.

1005
01:03:45,249 --> 01:03:50,562
- Really, Tony, this is most embarrassing.
- No, we weren't doing a thing.

1006
01:03:50,729 --> 01:03:53,118
Just having a quiet evening at home.

1007
01:03:53,209 --> 01:03:57,043
Yes, but don't let that bother you.
Please come in.

1008
01:03:57,489 --> 01:03:59,002
Come in, won't you?

1009
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:02,764
- This is Alice's mother.
- How do you do?

1010
01:04:02,849 --> 01:04:07,206
Alice's sister and Mr. Carmichael...

1011
01:04:07,649 --> 01:04:08,798
...her husband.

1012
01:04:09,809 --> 01:04:12,369
And this is Mr. Kolenkhov.

1013
01:04:23,409 --> 01:04:27,163
And the discus thrower is Mr. DePinna.

1014
01:04:27,969 --> 01:04:29,641
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1015
01:04:29,729 --> 01:04:32,243
Excuse my costume. I'll take it right off.

1016
01:04:32,329 --> 01:04:33,762
Jim.

1017
01:04:38,929 --> 01:04:39,918
Alice.

1018
01:04:42,409 --> 01:04:43,444
What is it?

1019
01:04:43,529 --> 01:04:46,680
Will you come down?
We have a big surprise for you.

1020
01:04:46,769 --> 01:04:47,997
Be right down.

1021
01:04:49,889 --> 01:04:51,720
Won't you take your things off?

1022
01:04:51,809 --> 01:04:55,199
Will you take your father's coat?
Hang it up over there. Shall I...

1023
01:04:56,289 --> 01:04:59,599
I'm very uncomfortable, Tony.
This is all very embarrassing.

1024
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,924
Now, anybody can get mixed up.

1025
01:05:02,009 --> 01:05:04,159
A chair for Mrs. Kirby.
Get that out of the way.

1026
01:05:04,249 --> 01:05:06,365
The rug, dear, the rug.

1027
01:05:06,449 --> 01:05:10,078
That one for Mrs. Kirby, I think.
And that one for Mr. Kirby.

1028
01:05:10,529 --> 01:05:12,406
Ed, get that chair.

1029
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:14,603
Thank you.

1030
01:05:16,889 --> 01:05:18,561
- Thank you, Ed.
- Yes, sir.

1031
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:27,128
What about some dinner
for these good people?

1032
01:05:27,209 --> 01:05:30,087
After all, they did come for dinner,
you know.

1033
01:05:30,169 --> 01:05:32,285
- Please don't bother.
- It's no bother at all.

1034
01:05:32,369 --> 01:05:35,520
Tell Donald to run to Murphy's
and get half a dozen bottles of beer.

1035
01:05:35,609 --> 01:05:36,724
And some canned salmon.

1036
01:05:36,809 --> 01:05:39,562
Wait a minute.
Mr. Kirby, do you like canned salmon?

1037
01:05:39,649 --> 01:05:41,207
Don't trouble, please. I'm not hungry.

1038
01:05:41,289 --> 01:05:45,282
We're having frankfurters, but I don't think
there will be enough now that you've come.

1039
01:05:45,369 --> 01:05:47,963
Make it frankfurters, and tell Donald to get...

1040
01:05:49,569 --> 01:05:52,766
Tell Donald to get a dozen more
and an extra can of corn.

1041
01:05:52,849 --> 01:05:55,079
- See if Rheba has enough sauerkraut.
- All right.

1042
01:05:55,169 --> 01:05:56,397
- Tell Donald to hurry.
- Yes.

1043
01:05:56,489 --> 01:06:00,243
It won't take long.
Murphy's delicatessen is right next door.

1044
01:06:00,409 --> 01:06:01,728
The pipe.

1045
01:06:02,489 --> 01:06:04,559
This is Alice's father.

1046
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:06,602
Mr. And Mrs. Kirby.

1047
01:06:06,689 --> 01:06:08,407
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1048
01:06:08,489 --> 01:06:12,687
I hope you'll pardon my appearance.
I couldn't find my other pants in the cellar.

1049
01:06:12,769 --> 01:06:14,760
It's quite all right.

1050
01:06:21,289 --> 01:06:23,325
Without holding!

1051
01:06:27,769 --> 01:06:28,997
Oh, my.

1052
01:06:30,009 --> 01:06:33,240
What do you think, Alice?
They thought it was tonight.

1053
01:06:35,289 --> 01:06:37,007
Tony, don't you remember what...

1054
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:41,798
- Have you all met?
- Oh, yes.

1055
01:06:42,249 --> 01:06:44,319
I'm so confused.

1056
01:06:44,409 --> 01:06:47,082
I had such a nice party planned
for tomorrow night.

1057
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:49,205
Perhaps we can come back again
tomorrow night.

1058
01:06:49,289 --> 01:06:50,722
Yes, of course.

1059
01:06:50,809 --> 01:06:53,721
- Sit down, Mr. Kirby.
- Thank you.

1060
01:07:00,289 --> 01:07:02,849
Mother, I guess we'd better see
about getting dinner.

1061
01:07:02,929 --> 01:07:04,999
Oh, that's all done, Alice.

1062
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:15,640
He didn't touch second.

1063
01:07:26,249 --> 01:07:28,683
Mother, what did you send out for?

1064
01:07:28,769 --> 01:07:31,841
Mr. Kirby should have told you
that he suffers from indigestion.

1065
01:07:31,929 --> 01:07:34,841
Now, Miriam.
It isn't as serious as all that.

1066
01:07:34,929 --> 01:07:38,842
Perhaps it is not indigestion.
Perhaps it is stomach ulcers.

1067
01:07:41,089 --> 01:07:42,283
Ulcers?

1068
01:07:43,449 --> 01:07:46,247
Don't pay any attention to Mr. Kolenkhov.

1069
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:50,363
He's Russian and the Russians
are inclined to look on the dark side.

1070
01:07:50,449 --> 01:07:55,000
All right, I'm Russian, but a friend of mine,
a Russian, died from stomach ulcers.

1071
01:07:58,049 --> 01:08:00,802
Mr. Kolenkhov, Mr. Kirby has indigestion
and that's all.

1072
01:08:00,889 --> 01:08:02,845
All right, let him wait.

1073
01:08:02,929 --> 01:08:06,922
Please, folks.
Let's not discuss Mr. Kirby's ulcers.

1074
01:08:07,369 --> 01:08:10,805
Grandpa, please talk about something else.
Ask Mr. Kirby about business.

1075
01:08:10,889 --> 01:08:12,607
I'll be right back.

1076
01:08:13,369 --> 01:08:17,442
As a matter of fact, Mr. Kirby,
how are business conditions?

1077
01:08:18,249 --> 01:08:19,364
What?

1078
01:08:19,569 --> 01:08:23,244
Well, that depends
on what side of the fence you're on.

1079
01:08:24,209 --> 01:08:26,643
Personally, I find an improvement.

1080
01:08:26,849 --> 01:08:32,162
There are two schools of thought
on that subject, and I have no ulcers.

1081
01:08:32,729 --> 01:08:34,003
You wait.

1082
01:08:42,809 --> 01:08:46,688
- Do you mind if I smoke a cigar?
- Not at all. Of course not.

1083
01:08:59,329 --> 01:09:01,843
What about the unemployment problem?

1084
01:09:02,609 --> 01:09:04,042
Unemployment?

1085
01:09:04,969 --> 01:09:07,642
Unemployment is not the main problem,
Mr. Vanderhof.

1086
01:09:07,729 --> 01:09:08,764
No?

1087
01:09:08,929 --> 01:09:10,647
- Why, I thought...
- Yes, I know.

1088
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:14,517
But that sort of viewpoint
is purely emotional, not economic.

1089
01:09:15,409 --> 01:09:17,798
Now, for instance, in 1929...

1090
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:26,599
My goodness, that's wonderful.

1091
01:09:27,249 --> 01:09:29,240
It really frightened you, didn't it?

1092
01:09:29,329 --> 01:09:31,081
Mr. Poppins.

1093
01:09:31,369 --> 01:09:33,007
Mr. And Mrs. Kirby.

1094
01:09:34,049 --> 01:09:36,244
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1095
01:09:36,329 --> 01:09:39,844
Mr. Poppins makes up these masks
as a sort of hobby.

1096
01:09:40,129 --> 01:09:41,801
Oh, really?

1097
01:09:41,889 --> 01:09:46,041
I think he ought to warn people
before he pops up in front of them like that.

1098
01:09:48,889 --> 01:09:51,198
Now, let me see. What can we talk about?

1099
01:09:51,289 --> 01:09:54,759
- Have you any hobbies, Mr. Kirby?
- Business is my hobby.

1100
01:09:55,049 --> 01:09:57,768
- Grandpa plays the harmonica.
- Really?

1101
01:09:57,849 --> 01:09:59,840
Did you ever try one, Mr. Kirby?

1102
01:10:00,169 --> 01:10:01,238
Well, I...

1103
01:10:01,329 --> 01:10:04,639
He used to be champion.
He won first prize at amateur night.

1104
01:10:04,729 --> 01:10:07,197
Told me so himself, didn't you, Dad?

1105
01:10:09,049 --> 01:10:12,564
Say, I bet you and I could do a mean duet.

1106
01:10:12,729 --> 01:10:15,118
I'm too busy a man
to fool around with harmonicas.

1107
01:10:15,209 --> 01:10:16,881
Here we are.

1108
01:10:17,489 --> 01:10:20,242
Did you get everything, Donald?

1109
01:10:20,329 --> 01:10:23,924
Yes. They didn't have any more weenies,
so I got pickled pigs' feet.

1110
01:10:24,009 --> 01:10:26,477
Never mind.
Just take everything into the kitchen.

1111
01:10:26,569 --> 01:10:30,084
I'll have some scrambled eggs made for you,
and a plain salad.

1112
01:10:30,169 --> 01:10:31,602
That'll be fine. Thank you.

1113
01:10:31,689 --> 01:10:33,122
Forgot the mustard.

1114
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:47,084
That's that, I guess.
Fine impression we're making.

1115
01:10:47,329 --> 01:10:51,800
Tony, how could you make such a mistake?
You knew it was for tomorrow night.

1116
01:10:52,369 --> 01:10:55,122
Yeah, I guess it wasn't such a hot idea.

1117
01:10:56,489 --> 01:10:58,400
You mean you did it on purpose?

1118
01:10:59,929 --> 01:11:02,921
Tony, that's dreadful.
How could you do such a thing?

1119
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:06,479
I didn't want to bring them down here at all,
but you insisted.

1120
01:11:06,569 --> 01:11:09,527
If they have to meet you,
I want them to meet you as you are.

1121
01:11:09,609 --> 01:11:12,681
Not on some trumped-up evening
with everybody acting unnaturally.

1122
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:15,078
There's nothing unnatural
in wanting them to like us.

1123
01:11:15,169 --> 01:11:17,558
If they don't like you the way you are,
too bad.

1124
01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:20,482
It doesn't make any difference to me
what they think.

1125
01:11:20,569 --> 01:11:23,925
If you'd just left things alone,
everything would have been all right.

1126
01:11:24,009 --> 01:11:27,684
But, no, you had to go and get funny
and spoil everything.

1127
01:11:28,809 --> 01:11:31,403
It was a pretty stupid idea, I know.

1128
01:11:31,649 --> 01:11:34,721
But, Alice, I'm just trying to be honest
about this thing.

1129
01:11:34,809 --> 01:11:38,597
I brought my family down here
just as they are, stuffed shirts and all.

1130
01:11:38,689 --> 01:11:41,840
I'm not trying to put on an act with them.
Why should you?

1131
01:11:41,929 --> 01:11:46,798
I'm trying to be honest, too. Can't you
understand? I've got to get their approval.

1132
01:11:46,889 --> 01:11:51,087
I'm not going to stand for your mother
looking at me as if I were a thief.

1133
01:11:51,169 --> 01:11:53,125
What do you think I am, a goop?

1134
01:11:53,689 --> 01:11:55,202
Start the eggs, Rheba.

1135
01:11:56,529 --> 01:11:58,918
Have you any hobbies, Mrs. Kirby?

1136
01:11:59,369 --> 01:12:01,803
Well, as a matter of fact, I have.

1137
01:12:02,569 --> 01:12:04,639
I'm a student of occultism.

1138
01:12:04,769 --> 01:12:06,999
- What's that?
- That's spiritualism, dear.

1139
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:10,286
Spiritualism?
Why, Mrs. Kirby, I'm surprised.

1140
01:12:10,369 --> 01:12:14,362
- Everybody knows spiritualism is a fake.
- I beg your pardon?

1141
01:12:14,449 --> 01:12:17,600
Now, Penny. You mustn't criticize
other people's hobbies.

1142
01:12:17,689 --> 01:12:21,364
- You got one or two of your own, you know.
- Yes, but not silly ones.

1143
01:12:33,009 --> 01:12:36,843
The perfect hobby should improve the body
as well as the mind.

1144
01:12:37,169 --> 01:12:40,878
The Romans were great people. Why?
What was their hobby? Wrestling.

1145
01:12:40,969 --> 01:12:44,644
In wrestling you must think quick
with the mind and act quick with the body.

1146
01:12:44,729 --> 01:12:47,243
Yeah. I agree with you.

1147
01:12:47,489 --> 01:12:50,287
When I was young, I was pretty good at it.

1148
01:12:50,689 --> 01:12:53,726
- But, unfortunately, as one grows older...
- Foolishness.

1149
01:12:53,809 --> 01:12:55,640
Once a wrestler, you never forget.

1150
01:12:55,729 --> 01:12:59,165
I have not done it for six years,
but I forget nothing.

1151
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:00,364
Look.

1152
01:13:12,129 --> 01:13:13,642
What's happening in here?

1153
01:13:18,009 --> 01:13:19,920
Sit down, Mr. Kirby.

1154
01:13:24,009 --> 01:13:27,046
- Where are my glasses?
- Here they are.

1155
01:13:27,129 --> 01:13:29,359
Mr. Kirby, they're broken.

1156
01:13:29,449 --> 01:13:33,044
I am sorry, but when you wrestle again,
Mr. Kirby, you will of course...

1157
01:13:33,129 --> 01:13:34,278
...not wear your glasses.

1158
01:13:34,369 --> 01:13:39,079
- I do not intend to wrestle again, sir.
- That was very silly, Kolenkhov.

1159
01:13:39,169 --> 01:13:40,807
I'm sorry you did that.

1160
01:13:43,009 --> 01:13:44,681
I'm sorry, Mr. Kirby.

1161
01:13:46,169 --> 01:13:48,637
If you don't mind, I think we better be going.

1162
01:13:48,729 --> 01:13:51,402
- That's the best idea I've heard yet.
- Please don't go.

1163
01:13:51,489 --> 01:13:54,162
You're absolutely right, Mrs. Kirby.
I think you should go.

1164
01:13:54,249 --> 01:13:58,083
The whole thing was a mistake.
I'm terribly sorry for everything.

1165
01:13:59,009 --> 01:14:01,000
Alice, let me stay. I want to talk to you.

1166
01:14:01,089 --> 01:14:03,478
I'd rather you didn't.
There's nothing to talk about.

1167
01:14:03,569 --> 01:14:05,764
- Good night, Mrs. Kirby.
- Good night.

1168
01:14:05,849 --> 01:14:09,285
Good night, Mr. Kirby.
I hope you didn't get hurt.

1169
01:14:09,369 --> 01:14:12,645
No. It's a pleasure to have met all of you.

1170
01:14:12,889 --> 01:14:14,561
- Tony, come on.
- Alice, I...

1171
01:14:16,169 --> 01:14:17,921
- Will I see you tomorrow?
- I don't know.

1172
01:14:18,009 --> 01:14:20,284
- But I...
- Good night, Tony.

1173
01:14:22,289 --> 01:14:23,608
Good night.

1174
01:14:26,969 --> 01:14:30,006
- Stay right where you are, everybody.
- For heaven's sake.

1175
01:14:30,089 --> 01:14:31,602
What's this all about?

1176
01:14:31,689 --> 01:14:33,486
- Which one is it?
- That one over there.

1177
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:34,922
Who? Me? What do you mean?

1178
01:14:35,009 --> 01:14:38,843
- Look here. We don't belong in this house.
- Keep your mouth shut, you.

1179
01:14:39,769 --> 01:14:40,758
What's your name?

1180
01:14:40,849 --> 01:14:43,079
Ed Carmichael, and I haven't done anything.

1181
01:14:43,169 --> 01:14:45,637
See here. This seems very high-handed.

1182
01:14:45,729 --> 01:14:48,766
- What's it all about?
- Police Department.

1183
01:14:49,049 --> 01:14:50,277
J-men.

1184
01:14:51,169 --> 01:14:53,729
- G-men, Penny.
- Ed, what have you done?

1185
01:14:53,809 --> 01:14:56,004
Nothing. I told you
somebody was following me.

1186
01:14:56,089 --> 01:14:58,842
But these people don't belong here.
Please let them go.

1187
01:14:58,929 --> 01:15:00,726
Don't let anybody out that door.

1188
01:15:00,809 --> 01:15:03,607
This is outrageous.
Do you realise who I am?

1189
01:15:03,849 --> 01:15:07,046
- What's your name?
- Beton Batopevitch Kolenkhov.

1190
01:15:07,849 --> 01:15:10,124
- Where are you from?
- Omsk.

1191
01:15:16,129 --> 01:15:18,563
- Where?
- Omsk.

1192
01:15:23,089 --> 01:15:25,478
- These stairs lead to the cellar?
- Yes, they do.

1193
01:15:25,569 --> 01:15:27,400
Look out, Chief.

1194
01:15:31,809 --> 01:15:35,324
- What do you call this?
- It's called the New Monster.

1195
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:38,083
Oh, playing boogieman, huh?

1196
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:40,639
Yeah. Get over there.

1197
01:15:40,729 --> 01:15:43,687
He must've gotten out
of the wrong side of the bed this morning.

1198
01:15:43,769 --> 01:15:44,997
Mike, Bill.

1199
01:15:45,089 --> 01:15:46,488
Take a look.

1200
01:15:48,449 --> 01:15:49,928
Come here, you.

1201
01:15:53,329 --> 01:15:56,844
- Ever see these before?
- Yes, sir. I printed lots of them.

1202
01:15:56,929 --> 01:15:59,921
- Oh, you print this stuff?
- Yes, sir.

1203
01:16:00,009 --> 01:16:03,797
And you put them into candy boxes
to get them into people's homes?

1204
01:16:03,889 --> 01:16:06,562
- Oh, my Love Dreams.
- But I didn't mean anything.

1205
01:16:06,649 --> 01:16:08,685
- You didn't?
- No, sir.

1206
01:16:08,929 --> 01:16:12,160
- "Watch for the Revolution."
- Radicals.

1207
01:16:12,529 --> 01:16:14,679
"The Red Flag will sweep the country."

1208
01:16:14,769 --> 01:16:17,124
I didn't mean that.
I just like to print, that's all.

1209
01:16:17,209 --> 01:16:21,248
Oh, see here.
The government isn't in any danger from Ed.

1210
01:16:21,329 --> 01:16:24,560
Why, printing is just his hobby. That's all.

1211
01:16:24,649 --> 01:16:26,526
He'd print anything.

1212
01:16:26,609 --> 01:16:28,247
It's just like a play, isn't it?

1213
01:16:28,329 --> 01:16:30,320
Now, look here, young man.

1214
01:16:31,329 --> 01:16:33,399
Don't be so silly. I must get my pipe.

1215
01:16:33,489 --> 01:16:36,287
We were right. There is enough gunpowder
to blow up the town.

1216
01:16:36,369 --> 01:16:37,518
- We only use that...
- Shut up.

1217
01:16:37,609 --> 01:16:39,201
Everybody here is under arrest.

1218
01:16:39,289 --> 01:16:40,517
- What's that?
- I must get it.

1219
01:16:40,609 --> 01:16:42,008
Stay right here.

1220
01:16:42,089 --> 01:16:44,205
- I must get it.
- You stay right where you are.

1221
01:16:44,289 --> 01:16:45,722
But it's lit.

1222
01:16:48,609 --> 01:16:51,043
- What's that?
- The fireworks.

1223
01:16:53,289 --> 01:16:54,563
Jim.

1224
01:16:54,649 --> 01:16:56,560
- Anthony.
- Miriam, run!

1225
01:16:56,649 --> 01:16:59,004
- Grandpa!
- Keep your shirts on.

1226
01:16:59,369 --> 01:17:01,280
The Revolution!

1227
01:17:51,369 --> 01:17:52,484
Home again.

1228
01:17:54,209 --> 01:17:57,042
Just like Siberia. Only it stinks.

1229
01:17:57,169 --> 01:17:59,478
It was fun being fingerprinted, wasn't it?

1230
01:17:59,569 --> 01:18:02,402
Mr. Kirby didn't think so.
It took three men to hold him down.

1231
01:18:02,489 --> 01:18:06,926
Never a dull moment, that's what I say,
never a dull moment.

1232
01:18:07,009 --> 01:18:08,647
I can walk alone.

1233
01:18:08,729 --> 01:18:11,197
I never heard of anything so outrageous
in my life.

1234
01:18:11,289 --> 01:18:12,278
Never mind the argument.

1235
01:18:12,369 --> 01:18:15,600
Stop pushing me around, fools.
I'm Anthony P. Kirby. You hear me?

1236
01:18:15,689 --> 01:18:16,963
Okay, I'm George Washington.

1237
01:18:17,049 --> 01:18:20,246
I want a telephone.
I want to call my attorneys, you numbskulls.

1238
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:22,797
We've made two calls for you already.
Keep your shirt on.

1239
01:18:22,889 --> 01:18:26,518
- But this is Mr. Kirby, the banker.
- Yeah, well, that ain't my fault.

1240
01:18:26,609 --> 01:18:29,646
Night court's in session right now.
He'll have to wait his turn.

1241
01:18:29,729 --> 01:18:32,562
- I'm sorry, Mr. Kirby.
- You're sorry.

1242
01:18:32,649 --> 01:18:34,685
That's something
after what I've been through.

1243
01:18:34,769 --> 01:18:37,522
After all, you did come on the wrong night.

1244
01:18:37,609 --> 01:18:40,203
The mayor will hear of this
and so will the commissioner.

1245
01:18:40,289 --> 01:18:43,042
- I'll have you all fired!
- Dad, don't get excited.

1246
01:18:43,129 --> 01:18:44,482
In a couple of hours...

1247
01:18:44,569 --> 01:18:48,562
I hope you're satisfied with your mother
in there with a lot of cheap, common...

1248
01:18:48,649 --> 01:18:51,083
Pipe down, big shot. We want music.

1249
01:18:51,169 --> 01:18:53,319
Hit it up, Pop, and make it hot.

1250
01:19:40,329 --> 01:19:43,002
Listen, Matron, I'm Mrs. Kirby.
Mrs. Anthony P. Kirby.

1251
01:19:43,089 --> 01:19:45,478
I'll give you $100
if you'll get me a private room.

1252
01:19:45,569 --> 01:19:49,278
- We have those for the insane cases.
- Please, she doesn't belong here with us.

1253
01:19:49,369 --> 01:19:53,157
Have her throw a couple of fits, lady,
and I'll try to fix it.

1254
01:19:53,249 --> 01:19:57,527
Mrs. Kirby, please, believe me, I'm so sorry
to have gotten you into all these troubles.

1255
01:19:57,609 --> 01:20:00,521
I'll appreciate it
if you'll leave me strictly alone.

1256
01:20:00,609 --> 01:20:03,567
Don't let her get you, sister.
They're getting tougher every place.

1257
01:20:03,649 --> 01:20:05,526
Where you been operating?

1258
01:20:05,609 --> 01:20:09,124
You got class. That's the connection
I'm looking for.

1259
01:20:09,209 --> 01:20:12,281
Wasn't it exciting in that car
with the sirens screaming?

1260
01:20:15,289 --> 01:20:19,760
You better sit on your hands, Mrs. Kirby.
It gets kind of cold after you sit awhile.

1261
01:20:19,849 --> 01:20:23,842
All right, but don't say I didn't tell you
when you begin to feel it.

1262
01:20:24,249 --> 01:20:25,682
Oh, good heavens.

1263
01:20:26,289 --> 01:20:30,202
Come down off your high horse.
It'll do you some good.

1264
01:20:30,289 --> 01:20:32,883
If you don't mind,
I don't need anyone to do me good.

1265
01:20:32,969 --> 01:20:35,119
Never can tell. I know a good...

1266
01:20:35,209 --> 01:20:37,165
Let her alone. Can't you see she's a lady?

1267
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:39,717
A lady? They sure get around nowadays.

1268
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:45,280
You needn't waste your time trying
to protect me. That won't help you.

1269
01:20:45,369 --> 01:20:47,883
If you had any sense,
you'd stay where you belong...

1270
01:20:47,969 --> 01:20:49,960
...and stop being ambitious.

1271
01:20:51,369 --> 01:20:53,325
Shall I sock her, Alice?

1272
01:20:53,889 --> 01:20:57,086
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1273
01:21:13,449 --> 01:21:18,045
Spend $250,000 a year
for attorneys and I can't get one of them.

1274
01:21:43,049 --> 01:21:45,404
Young man, will you get me
some bicarbonate of soda?

1275
01:21:45,489 --> 01:21:46,638
What flavour?

1276
01:21:50,089 --> 01:21:53,684
Well, I've got you to thank for this.
I hope it will teach you a lesson.

1277
01:21:53,769 --> 01:21:55,282
Fooling around with stenographers.

1278
01:21:55,369 --> 01:21:59,442
- Now, listen, Dad. I intend to marry that girl.
- Yes, I know.

1279
01:22:00,009 --> 01:22:04,400
I was going to marry a waitress once,
but my father knocked it out of me.

1280
01:22:04,489 --> 01:22:06,047
If you'll excuse me, Mr. Kirby.

1281
01:22:06,129 --> 01:22:10,805
I don't believe anyone has the right
to interfere with young people in love.

1282
01:22:11,289 --> 01:22:13,564
- Why don't you relax?
- Relax?

1283
01:22:13,649 --> 01:22:16,368
With my son practically being stolen
from under my nose.

1284
01:22:16,449 --> 01:22:19,919
Me being locked up like a common criminal.
Relax!

1285
01:22:20,009 --> 01:22:22,762
You know what will happen
if the newspapers get hold of this?

1286
01:22:22,849 --> 01:22:25,317
It'll jeopardise the biggest deal of my career.

1287
01:22:25,409 --> 01:22:26,888
Stop worrying.

1288
01:22:27,249 --> 01:22:31,925
If I know my granddaughter, she isn't
going to marry Tony without your blessing.

1289
01:22:32,089 --> 01:22:36,082
The only thing you've got to be concerned
about is this big deal of yours.

1290
01:22:36,169 --> 01:22:38,319
What if it does fall through?

1291
01:22:38,409 --> 01:22:40,923
What if all your deals fall through?

1292
01:22:41,169 --> 01:22:43,967
- Might be a good thing for you.
- Man, you're crazy.

1293
01:22:44,049 --> 01:22:48,008
Well, maybe I am,
but I used to be just like you once.

1294
01:22:48,649 --> 01:22:51,686
Then one morning,
when I was going up in the elevator...

1295
01:22:51,769 --> 01:22:54,522
...it struck me I wasn't having any fun.

1296
01:22:54,849 --> 01:22:58,046
So I came right down and never went back.

1297
01:22:58,889 --> 01:23:01,483
Yes, sir. That was 35 years ago.

1298
01:23:01,569 --> 01:23:04,208
Admirable.
And you haven't done a thing since?

1299
01:23:04,289 --> 01:23:07,964
Oh, yes. Just the things I wanted to do.

1300
01:23:08,409 --> 01:23:09,967
Collected stamps.

1301
01:23:10,049 --> 01:23:14,520
Went to the zoo when I got the notion,
took up the harmonica again...

1302
01:23:14,929 --> 01:23:18,365
...and even found time
to notice when spring came around.

1303
01:23:18,649 --> 01:23:23,564
This would be a fine country if we all
visited the zoo and played the harmonica.

1304
01:23:23,729 --> 01:23:27,199
You used to play one yourself.
Tony said so.

1305
01:23:27,889 --> 01:23:30,164
Maybe you ought to take it up again.

1306
01:23:30,369 --> 01:23:34,965
Maybe it would stop you trying to be
so desperate about making more money...

1307
01:23:35,049 --> 01:23:36,721
...than you can ever use.

1308
01:23:37,129 --> 01:23:40,485
You can't take it with you, Mr. Kirby.
So what good is it?

1309
01:23:41,129 --> 01:23:46,408
As near as I can see, the only thing you can
take with you is the love of your friends.

1310
01:23:46,729 --> 01:23:50,119
Why don't you go out
and get yourself a pulpit somewhere?

1311
01:23:50,889 --> 01:23:52,208
I'm sorry.

1312
01:23:52,449 --> 01:23:54,599
- Which one is Vanderhof?
- Right here.

1313
01:23:55,089 --> 01:23:57,728
Hello, Mr. Vanderhof. Remember me?

1314
01:23:58,129 --> 01:23:59,323
Twitch-face.

1315
01:23:59,409 --> 01:24:04,085
Yes, I heard that you were in trouble
and came over to see if I could help you out.

1316
01:24:04,169 --> 01:24:06,125
Why should you want to help me?

1317
01:24:06,209 --> 01:24:09,007
To tell you the truth,
I thought that if I did you a favour...

1318
01:24:09,089 --> 01:24:12,638
You're wasting your time,
Mr. Twitch, Mr. Blakely.

1319
01:24:13,049 --> 01:24:17,565
- I have no intention of selling my home.
- We'll see how long you can hold out.

1320
01:24:17,689 --> 01:24:19,839
Wait till a few more things happen to you.

1321
01:24:19,929 --> 01:24:23,968
- So you arranged this arrest?
- Yes, and it's just a starter.

1322
01:24:24,049 --> 01:24:27,485
By the time I get through,
you'll be willing and glad to sell.

1323
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:30,285
So you did this?

1324
01:24:31,529 --> 01:24:32,564
Why, Mr. Kirby.

1325
01:24:32,649 --> 01:24:34,799
You blockhead.
Do you know what you've done?

1326
01:24:34,889 --> 01:24:38,564
But, Mr. Kirby, I never dreamed
that you knew these people.

1327
01:24:38,689 --> 01:24:42,807
I told you the police were on their trail.
You told me to make them sell.

1328
01:24:42,889 --> 01:24:44,368
You blithering idiot, get out.

1329
01:24:44,449 --> 01:24:46,963
If you've got any sense left,
you'll dig up my attorneys.

1330
01:24:47,049 --> 01:24:50,086
- I've been here for hours.
- Yes, sir. I'll phone them all.

1331
01:24:52,609 --> 01:24:55,407
So, you're the one
that's been holding up my deal?

1332
01:24:56,609 --> 01:24:59,999
- Yes. Kind of funny, isn't it?
- What's funny about it?

1333
01:25:00,849 --> 01:25:06,003
The idea of you engineering this thing
and being caught in your own trap.

1334
01:25:06,609 --> 01:25:10,079
Maybe it won't be so funny
when I take that house away from you.

1335
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:14,568
Now I begin to see what's been going on.
That's a fine trick, Mr. Vanderhof.

1336
01:25:14,649 --> 01:25:17,880
Using my son to get information,
and then making me pay through the nose.

1337
01:25:17,969 --> 01:25:20,199
- Wait...
- I won't pay for anything I don't want to.

1338
01:25:20,289 --> 01:25:23,326
- I'll show you business the Kirby way.
- Business?

1339
01:25:23,409 --> 01:25:26,128
You're not a businessman.
You're like a lion in the jungle.

1340
01:25:26,209 --> 01:25:28,484
I've got the longest
and the sharpest claws, too.

1341
01:25:28,569 --> 01:25:32,244
That's how I got on top,
and scum like this is still in the gutter.

1342
01:25:34,209 --> 01:25:35,642
You're an idiot, Mr. Kirby.

1343
01:25:35,729 --> 01:25:37,401
- What?
- A stupid idiot.

1344
01:25:37,489 --> 01:25:40,003
- You can't talk to me like that.
- Yes, I can.

1345
01:25:40,129 --> 01:25:41,528
Scum, are we?

1346
01:25:41,729 --> 01:25:45,244
What makes you think
you're such a superior human being?

1347
01:25:45,409 --> 01:25:48,719
Your money? If you do,
you're a dull-witted fool, Mr. Kirby.

1348
01:25:48,809 --> 01:25:50,561
And a poor one at that.

1349
01:25:50,649 --> 01:25:53,447
You're poorer than any of these people
that you call scum.

1350
01:25:53,529 --> 01:25:56,965
Because I'll guarantee
at least they've got some friends.

1351
01:25:57,049 --> 01:26:00,962
But you, with your jungle and long claws,
as you call them...

1352
01:26:01,249 --> 01:26:06,118
...you'll wind up your miserable existence
without anything you can call a friend.

1353
01:26:07,129 --> 01:26:12,044
You may be a high mogul to yourself,
Mr. Kirby, but to me you're a failure.

1354
01:26:12,609 --> 01:26:17,125
A failure as a man,
a failure as a human being...

1355
01:26:17,249 --> 01:26:19,638
...even a failure as a father.

1356
01:26:20,529 --> 01:26:24,602
When your time comes, I doubt
if a single tear will be shed over you.

1357
01:26:24,689 --> 01:26:27,203
The world will probably cry
"good riddance."

1358
01:26:27,649 --> 01:26:31,198
That's a nice prospect, Mr. Kirby.
I hope you'll enjoy it.

1359
01:26:31,289 --> 01:26:36,158
I hope you'll get some comfort out
of this coin you've been sweating over then.

1360
01:26:44,409 --> 01:26:45,922
I'm sorry, Mr. Kirby.

1361
01:26:47,129 --> 01:26:49,848
I haven't lost my temper like that
in 30-odd years.

1362
01:26:49,929 --> 01:26:52,124
Don't know what came over me.

1363
01:26:53,769 --> 01:26:55,999
I didn't mean anything I said.

1364
01:26:56,689 --> 01:26:59,681
I wish you'd told me
to mind my own business.

1365
01:27:00,969 --> 01:27:04,279
If there's any way I could make up for it...

1366
01:27:06,529 --> 01:27:07,564
...I would.

1367
01:27:07,649 --> 01:27:11,005
Here, how'd you like to have my harmonica?

1368
01:27:12,169 --> 01:27:15,366
It's a new one and good, too.

1369
01:27:17,009 --> 01:27:19,523
You might want to play it sometime.

1370
01:27:21,409 --> 01:27:24,719
After all, who am I to criticize anybody?

1371
01:27:24,809 --> 01:27:28,768
All right, everybody out for night court.
Have your slips ready.

1372
01:27:29,929 --> 01:27:31,681
I'm Mr. Kirby's attorney. Where is he?

1373
01:27:31,769 --> 01:27:34,203
- Kirby.
- Yes, Kirby, Kirby.

1374
01:27:34,969 --> 01:27:38,564
Oh, yes. They're just going to be arraigned.
Right through there.

1375
01:27:42,329 --> 01:27:44,843
Wonder what he's so excited about.

1376
01:27:46,369 --> 01:27:48,599
Attorney for Mr. Kirby.
Has he been arraigned yet?

1377
01:27:48,689 --> 01:27:51,328
- Not yet. Right through that door.
- Thank you.

1378
01:27:53,449 --> 01:27:54,564
Kirby?

1379
01:27:55,009 --> 01:27:56,203
Anthony P. Kirby.

1380
01:27:56,289 --> 01:28:00,328
- Is that Anthony P. Kirby, the banker?
- It's Kirby, the banker, you know.

1381
01:28:00,409 --> 01:28:03,242
Just a minute, please.
Yes, that's Anthony P. Kirby.

1382
01:28:03,329 --> 01:28:04,808
That's all we wanted to know.

1383
01:28:04,889 --> 01:28:06,117
Oh, boy.

1384
01:28:07,049 --> 01:28:10,166
- What did you say your name was?
- Anthony P. Kirby.

1385
01:28:12,609 --> 01:28:14,281
Psychopathic ward.

1386
01:28:16,409 --> 01:28:20,084
I sentence you to 31 days in the city jail...

1387
01:28:20,169 --> 01:28:22,637
...but I'll suspend 30 days of that sentence...

1388
01:28:22,729 --> 01:28:26,278
...if you give me your word
that as soon as you get out tomorrow...

1389
01:28:26,369 --> 01:28:28,200
...you'll go back to your folks in Kansas.

1390
01:28:28,289 --> 01:28:31,918
- Thank you, sir, thank you.
- That's all right, run along.

1391
01:28:33,289 --> 01:28:35,484
Your Honour, would you take
the Vanderhof case next?

1392
01:28:35,569 --> 01:28:36,558
Why?

1393
01:28:36,649 --> 01:28:38,799
We just found out
that one of them is A.P. Kirby.

1394
01:28:38,889 --> 01:28:40,208
- The banker?
- Yes.

1395
01:28:40,289 --> 01:28:41,358
What are the charges?

1396
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:44,805
Disturbing the peace and manufacturing
fireworks without a license.

1397
01:28:44,889 --> 01:28:46,004
Fireworks?

1398
01:28:46,729 --> 01:28:50,404
You mean to tell me that A.P. Kirby
has been held in the drunk tank?

1399
01:28:53,889 --> 01:28:56,164
Is that why
all these spectators are here tonight?

1400
01:28:56,249 --> 01:28:58,205
No. They are Vanderhof's friends.

1401
01:28:58,289 --> 01:29:00,883
I didn't know anybody had
that many friends anymore.

1402
01:29:00,969 --> 01:29:03,244
- Do the newspapermen know?
- I don't think so.

1403
01:29:03,329 --> 01:29:04,398
That's good.

1404
01:29:04,489 --> 01:29:08,368
What a holiday they'd have if they knew
A.P. Kirby was in the drunk tank.

1405
01:29:08,689 --> 01:29:11,078
Bring them in right away.
No use crucifying him.

1406
01:29:11,169 --> 01:29:14,286
- Bring in the Vanderhofs.
- Vanderhof case next.

1407
01:29:18,889 --> 01:29:20,959
Get away from me. Have you seen the...

1408
01:29:21,049 --> 01:29:22,402
Hello, Grandpa.

1409
01:29:22,489 --> 01:29:24,081
Hello, Grandpa.

1410
01:29:31,289 --> 01:29:32,563
Order. Order.

1411
01:29:35,849 --> 01:29:37,043
Quiet.

1412
01:29:37,689 --> 01:29:38,678
Order.

1413
01:29:43,569 --> 01:29:47,528
Your Honour, in arresting Mr. And Mrs. Kirby
and their son, a grave blunder was made...

1414
01:29:47,609 --> 01:29:48,758
...and we would suggest...

1415
01:29:48,849 --> 01:29:52,683
- Do all four of you represent Mr. Kirby?
- Yes, Your Honour.

1416
01:29:53,649 --> 01:29:56,527
Quite an array of talent for a misdemeanour.

1417
01:29:56,689 --> 01:30:00,204
If there's any objection
to Mr. Kirby being represented by counsel...

1418
01:30:00,289 --> 01:30:03,918
Not at all.
In fact, this court feels quite flattered.

1419
01:30:04,889 --> 01:30:06,208
Thank you.

1420
01:30:07,769 --> 01:30:09,805
The charge is disturbing the peace.

1421
01:30:09,889 --> 01:30:12,323
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty, of course.

1422
01:30:12,409 --> 01:30:13,524
Of course.

1423
01:30:13,769 --> 01:30:17,000
Mister, are you represented,
or any of your people, by counsel?

1424
01:30:17,089 --> 01:30:18,727
No, sir.

1425
01:30:19,489 --> 01:30:25,280
I guess we're disturbing the peace if one
took the trouble to make a complaint.

1426
01:30:26,209 --> 01:30:29,758
And if it's against the law
to manufacture fireworks without a licence...

1427
01:30:29,849 --> 01:30:34,365
...I guess we're guilty of that, too,
because we've been doing it a long time.

1428
01:30:37,129 --> 01:30:39,279
I don't feel guilty, do you, Essie?

1429
01:30:39,369 --> 01:30:40,882
Order, order, please.

1430
01:30:41,209 --> 01:30:44,121
Mr. Vanderhof,
on the charge of disturbing the peace...

1431
01:30:44,209 --> 01:30:47,838
...you and the rest of your family are,
by your own plea, guilty.

1432
01:30:47,929 --> 01:30:50,762
- However, I shall suspend sentence.
- Thank you.

1433
01:30:50,849 --> 01:30:55,240
But, the manufacturing of explosives
without a licence, I'm sorry...

1434
01:30:55,769 --> 01:30:58,681
...I'm forced to fine you $100.

1435
01:31:00,689 --> 01:31:02,168
$100!

1436
01:31:03,009 --> 01:31:04,567
That's a lot of money.

1437
01:31:06,009 --> 01:31:09,763
Your Honour, Mr. Kirby,
who is noted for his charitable work...

1438
01:31:09,889 --> 01:31:12,847
...would like to pay the fine
for this poor unfortunate family.

1439
01:31:12,929 --> 01:31:16,080
Oh, no, thank you. I can't let you do that.

1440
01:31:16,169 --> 01:31:19,798
No, you don't. Grandpa don't need
your money. We'll pay that fine.

1441
01:31:23,449 --> 01:31:25,917
Order, order! Order in the court.

1442
01:31:30,289 --> 01:31:31,722
Order, order.

1443
01:31:37,049 --> 01:31:40,644
No, it's all right, Officer.
It's all right. Let them come in.

1444
01:31:47,689 --> 01:31:48,963
We'll pay the fine.

1445
01:31:49,649 --> 01:31:51,321
We don't need your money.

1446
01:31:52,889 --> 01:31:56,325
A whole hatful, Grandpa. A whole hatful.

1447
01:32:01,209 --> 01:32:02,767
We'll get it, Grandpa.

1448
01:32:10,609 --> 01:32:12,759
There you are, Judge, is that enough?

1449
01:32:12,889 --> 01:32:14,481
Yes, I think so.

1450
01:32:15,729 --> 01:32:18,482
Take the money over to the clerk's desk.

1451
01:32:20,929 --> 01:32:24,205
Mr. Vanderhof, you're a very lucky man
to have so many friends.

1452
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:25,278
Yes.

1453
01:32:25,369 --> 01:32:27,758
- How about it, Lieutenant?
- You can't come in here.

1454
01:32:27,849 --> 01:32:30,079
Come on, will you?
Let us take just one flash.

1455
01:32:30,169 --> 01:32:31,568
Now, gentlemen.

1456
01:32:31,649 --> 01:32:35,358
I'd like to dismiss the charges
against the Kirbys of disturbing the peace...

1457
01:32:35,449 --> 01:32:39,522
...but they were present at the arrest
and if these people were guilty...

1458
01:32:39,609 --> 01:32:42,681
...then I must naturally assume
that the Kirbys were guilty also.

1459
01:32:42,769 --> 01:32:44,282
Your Honour, that's absurd.

1460
01:32:44,369 --> 01:32:47,122
Unless they can explain
what they were doing there.

1461
01:32:47,209 --> 01:32:49,245
Don't say a word, Anthony.

1462
01:32:49,769 --> 01:32:51,282
I'm afraid they've got you, Mother.

1463
01:32:51,369 --> 01:32:54,725
Do you realise, Your Honour,
that this gentleman is Mr. A.P. Kirby?

1464
01:32:54,809 --> 01:32:56,640
I've been made to realise that fact.

1465
01:32:56,729 --> 01:33:00,927
Perhaps Mr. Anthony P. Kirby himself
can explain what they were doing there.

1466
01:33:01,009 --> 01:33:03,682
- Well, Your Honour...
- I don't think that's important.

1467
01:33:03,769 --> 01:33:05,646
Haven't we been embarrassed enough?

1468
01:33:05,729 --> 01:33:10,007
It seems to me a little more respect
should be shown for our position.

1469
01:33:10,129 --> 01:33:12,245
Your Honour,
this charge is absolutely ridiculous.

1470
01:33:12,329 --> 01:33:16,288
Failing a satisfactory explanation,
I shall be obliged to have them stand trial.

1471
01:33:16,369 --> 01:33:18,439
- But...
- They have the right to be heard.

1472
01:33:18,529 --> 01:33:20,599
Your Honour, please.

1473
01:33:20,689 --> 01:33:24,318
Mr. Kirby came to see me
about buying my house.

1474
01:33:28,209 --> 01:33:30,404
- About buying your house?
- Yes.

1475
01:33:30,489 --> 01:33:34,721
He's been interested in the property
for some time now and...

1476
01:33:35,209 --> 01:33:37,962
He just came to talk over the deal.

1477
01:33:38,049 --> 01:33:39,198
That's all.

1478
01:33:39,289 --> 01:33:43,726
That's why we were there, and I don't
see why we should be held accountable...

1479
01:33:43,809 --> 01:33:46,642
...for anything that these people
might have done.

1480
01:33:46,969 --> 01:33:48,721
- That's not true.
- Now, Alice.

1481
01:33:48,809 --> 01:33:52,722
Grandpa, I won't stand
for our being humiliated like this.

1482
01:33:52,809 --> 01:33:55,562
They're ashamed to admit
they came to look my family over...

1483
01:33:55,649 --> 01:33:58,288
...to see if I was good enough
to marry their precious son.

1484
01:33:58,369 --> 01:34:02,282
- I never heard anything so silly in my life.
- That's the reason we were there.

1485
01:34:02,369 --> 01:34:03,882
It's about time you spoke up.

1486
01:34:03,969 --> 01:34:06,642
I've decided that it's your family
that isn't good enough.

1487
01:34:06,729 --> 01:34:10,608
I wouldn't be related to a bunch of snobs
like that for anything in the world.

1488
01:34:10,689 --> 01:34:13,726
Your mother's all in a dither
because of her social reputation.

1489
01:34:13,809 --> 01:34:16,960
- That's telling them, Alice.
- Who do they think they are?

1490
01:34:17,769 --> 01:34:18,804
Order!

1491
01:34:18,889 --> 01:34:23,804
Your reputation's safe,
and so is your son's, and your old man's.

1492
01:34:23,889 --> 01:34:24,878
What's up?

1493
01:34:24,969 --> 01:34:27,961
Cinderella just told Prince Charming
to go take a flying leap.

1494
01:34:28,049 --> 01:34:30,961
- How about we take a flying leap?
- That's a good idea.

1495
01:34:31,289 --> 01:34:32,722
Order in the court.

1496
01:34:33,969 --> 01:34:36,529
Order. Officer, put these men out.

1497
01:34:42,849 --> 01:34:45,921
The next time you go slumming,
stay away from our neighbourhood.

1498
01:34:46,009 --> 01:34:47,328
Alice, please.

1499
01:34:55,249 --> 01:34:56,682
Order.

1500
01:34:59,969 --> 01:35:00,958
Order.

1501
01:35:42,689 --> 01:35:44,805
Alice should've told us
where she was going.

1502
01:35:44,889 --> 01:35:46,925
Don't you think so, Essie?

1503
01:35:59,409 --> 01:36:01,240
Any word from her yet?

1504
01:36:03,889 --> 01:36:07,325
I've been all over town.
The detective agency worked all night on it.

1505
01:36:07,409 --> 01:36:10,879
They've checked every hotel
for 100 miles around.

1506
01:36:12,769 --> 01:36:15,158
Mrs. Sycamore, will you please tell me
where she is?

1507
01:36:15,249 --> 01:36:16,602
I don't know, Tony.

1508
01:36:16,689 --> 01:36:19,203
Even if I did, I'm sorry, I couldn't tell you.

1509
01:36:19,289 --> 01:36:20,404
If I wrote her a letter...

1510
01:36:20,489 --> 01:36:23,799
She doesn't want to see you.
That's why she went away, mostly.

1511
01:36:23,889 --> 01:36:26,847
There's no use you coming here anymore,
or trying to find her.

1512
01:36:26,929 --> 01:36:29,807
You'll only make things worse for her.
For us, too.

1513
01:36:36,009 --> 01:36:38,045
I guess that's that.

1514
01:36:42,769 --> 01:36:45,283
- We're awfully sorry, Tony.
- Thank you, sir.

1515
01:36:56,249 --> 01:36:58,638
Boy, I sure do feel sorry for Tony.

1516
01:36:58,729 --> 01:37:00,765
Rheba say you want something to eat,
somebody?

1517
01:37:00,849 --> 01:37:02,760
No, I'm not hungry, are you?

1518
01:37:02,849 --> 01:37:05,886
I ought to be cleaning up the cellar.
It's in an awful mess.

1519
01:37:13,929 --> 01:37:16,648
Look here, everyone.
Here's a letter from Alice.

1520
01:37:16,729 --> 01:37:17,798
Really?

1521
01:37:17,889 --> 01:37:19,766
- How is she?
- Where did you get it?

1522
01:37:19,849 --> 01:37:22,841
Ned, the postman, chased me
down the street and gave it to me.

1523
01:37:22,929 --> 01:37:25,807
He recognised her handwriting.
I've read it, Penny.

1524
01:37:26,009 --> 01:37:26,998
Read it aloud, Penny.

1525
01:37:27,089 --> 01:37:30,399
- Where's it from, Mother?
- Wait a minute. My hands are shaking.

1526
01:37:30,489 --> 01:37:33,401
She's staying with Helen,
that school friend in Riverside.

1527
01:37:33,489 --> 01:37:35,923
That's in Connecticut, isn't it, Grandpa?

1528
01:37:36,009 --> 01:37:37,681
Read the letter, Mother.

1529
01:37:37,769 --> 01:37:39,168
Now, let me see.

1530
01:37:39,249 --> 01:37:42,525
"And I was so miserable and confused
I had to do something.

1531
01:37:42,609 --> 01:37:44,645
"I do hope you'll understand.

1532
01:37:44,729 --> 01:37:47,527
"It's peaceful here and I've thought it all out.

1533
01:37:47,609 --> 01:37:51,966
"I know now the situation
between Tony and me is impossible.

1534
01:37:52,369 --> 01:37:56,601
"Mrs. Kirby was right.
I should have stayed in my own backyard.

1535
01:37:57,569 --> 01:38:00,606
"Don't worry about me, Mother.
I'll get over it.

1536
01:38:00,689 --> 01:38:03,408
"But, my darlings, I'm so lonesome for you.

1537
01:38:03,489 --> 01:38:05,798
"I don't know how I can stand it.

1538
01:38:06,249 --> 01:38:10,037
"Last night I cried myself to sleep,
and that helped a little.

1539
01:38:10,929 --> 01:38:14,922
"But this morning when I woke up
and realised I wasn't in my own bed...

1540
01:38:18,849 --> 01:38:23,286
"I wish I could rush back home.
But how can I, if I want to forget?

1541
01:38:24,449 --> 01:38:28,761
"The newspapers, Tony and a million things
make it impossible.

1542
01:38:30,289 --> 01:38:32,280
"Forgive me, my darlings.

1543
01:38:32,369 --> 01:38:37,238
"I promise to write every day,
sometimes twice or even more.

1544
01:38:38,529 --> 01:38:41,646
"Please, everybody,
take good care of yourselves.

1545
01:38:42,569 --> 01:38:44,958
"Don't let anything happen to you.

1546
01:38:45,329 --> 01:38:47,047
"All my love, Alice."

1547
01:38:48,889 --> 01:38:53,041
Sounds to me like she's not coming back.

1548
01:38:53,729 --> 01:38:55,481
Mr. Blakely, please.

1549
01:38:56,329 --> 01:38:57,603
Mr. Blakely?

1550
01:38:57,689 --> 01:39:01,204
Dad, you don't mean
you're thinking of selling the house?

1551
01:39:01,289 --> 01:39:02,768
Alice is right.

1552
01:39:02,849 --> 01:39:06,478
She can never come back here.
It would only make her miserable.

1553
01:39:07,049 --> 01:39:11,645
I won't let her live alone.
We'll find a place up there with her.

1554
01:39:12,289 --> 01:39:15,122
Mr. Blakely, this is Vanderhof.

1555
01:39:15,209 --> 01:39:17,677
Do you still want to buy the house?

1556
01:39:19,849 --> 01:39:22,044
You'll only pay $25,000 now.

1557
01:39:22,489 --> 01:39:25,128
Well, all right. Certainly, today.

1558
01:39:25,329 --> 01:39:27,843
All right, that's all. Goodbye.

1559
01:39:29,649 --> 01:39:34,325
Well, we had to leave this house sometime,
anyway.

1560
01:39:37,689 --> 01:39:39,919
I had a hard time,
but I made the old codger sell.

1561
01:39:40,009 --> 01:39:42,682
- Mr. Kirby's got all 12 blocks, solid.
- We can go ahead.

1562
01:39:42,769 --> 01:39:45,044
We've got the Vanderhof property.
Line up Kincaid now.

1563
01:39:45,129 --> 01:39:48,963
If that old gent hadn't sold,
the whole deal would've been blocked.

1564
01:39:49,529 --> 01:39:53,841
To all tenants in the 12-block area.
Notice. You are hereby notified that...

1565
01:39:53,969 --> 01:39:58,167
"You are notified that 10 days from this date
your premises must be vacated."

1566
01:39:58,249 --> 01:40:01,764
- That's the same as I've got.
- That certainly doesn't give us much time.

1567
01:40:01,849 --> 01:40:02,918
No.

1568
01:40:03,009 --> 01:40:06,524
Look. The Jensens must have gotten
their notice. Let's go see.

1569
01:40:11,329 --> 01:40:15,117
- Mr. Jensen, did you get one of these?
- Sure. We have to get out in 10 days.

1570
01:40:15,209 --> 01:40:17,245
- We all have to move.
- I can't understand it.

1571
01:40:17,329 --> 01:40:21,163
Grandpa said if they couldn't buy his house,
nobody would have to move.

1572
01:40:21,409 --> 01:40:22,524
Look.

1573
01:40:49,289 --> 01:40:51,200
Sorry, Mr. Kirby can't be disturbed.

1574
01:40:51,289 --> 01:40:52,722
I think it's all over, don't you?

1575
01:40:52,809 --> 01:40:55,243
Hello? Sorry, Mr. Kirby's not available.

1576
01:40:56,889 --> 01:40:59,847
Hello. He's not answering his phone.
Sorry.

1577
01:40:59,929 --> 01:41:00,918
I've just been upstairs.

1578
01:41:01,009 --> 01:41:04,797
All our board members are there,
and the heads of those six little companies.

1579
01:41:04,889 --> 01:41:06,641
This merger's going to make history!

1580
01:41:06,729 --> 01:41:09,004
The market doesn't know
whether to buy or sell.

1581
01:41:09,089 --> 01:41:11,239
I hope we're right.
I have everything sunk in this.

1582
01:41:11,329 --> 01:41:14,048
- Stop bellyaching. We can't miss.
- Where's Kirby?

1583
01:41:14,129 --> 01:41:16,643
- In there. We've been waiting for him.
- Who's with him?

1584
01:41:16,729 --> 01:41:19,323
Nobody. He's probably bowing
to the other Kirbys on the wall.

1585
01:41:19,409 --> 01:41:21,718
Hello. No.
Tell the senator to keep his shirt on.

1586
01:41:21,809 --> 01:41:25,563
- Kirby wants him to stay in Washington.
- No newspapers until after the meeting.

1587
01:41:25,649 --> 01:41:28,117
Ramsey make trouble for us?
You're crazy. He's broke.

1588
01:41:28,209 --> 01:41:30,404
He's finished.
Kirby hasn't even left him carfare.

1589
01:41:30,489 --> 01:41:32,081
You've got to hand it to the old man.

1590
01:41:32,169 --> 01:41:34,285
How he squeezed down on old Ramsey,
beautiful.

1591
01:41:34,369 --> 01:41:37,247
It wouldn't surprise me
if he were to blow his brains out.

1592
01:41:37,329 --> 01:41:38,398
They're waiting up there.

1593
01:41:38,489 --> 01:41:40,957
Get Kirby and get this over with
before something happens.

1594
01:41:41,049 --> 01:41:44,041
- Good idea.
- Wait, you know he doesn't like that.

1595
01:41:44,129 --> 01:41:45,278
Look at the time.

1596
01:41:45,369 --> 01:41:47,883
I'll get him on the phone.
Maybe he won't mind that.

1597
01:41:47,969 --> 01:41:50,005
Get me Mr. Kirby in the conference room.

1598
01:42:19,289 --> 01:42:21,086
Hello. Yeah.

1599
01:42:21,169 --> 01:42:24,081
Certainly. Well, come on.
What are you waiting for?

1600
01:42:26,409 --> 01:42:29,082
They're waiting upstairs.
We'd better be getting up there.

1601
01:42:29,169 --> 01:42:31,319
- Have you got your proxies?
- Including Kincaid's.

1602
01:42:31,409 --> 01:42:33,969
When we offered him presidency,
he jumped at it.

1603
01:42:34,049 --> 01:42:34,959
You offered what?

1604
01:42:35,049 --> 01:42:38,246
I explained you wanted to be
the chairman of the board of directors.

1605
01:42:38,329 --> 01:42:40,684
Tell him it's a mistake.
I've chosen the president.

1606
01:42:40,769 --> 01:42:42,680
Anthony Kirby, Jr. Is to be president.

1607
01:42:42,769 --> 01:42:44,600
- Tony? He's much too young, A.P.
- Is he?

1608
01:42:44,689 --> 01:42:47,567
- What about our promise to Kincaid?
- Forget about him.

1609
01:42:47,649 --> 01:42:50,447
- But, we have obligations...
- I said, forget about him.

1610
01:42:50,529 --> 01:42:54,044
Now, please, Mr. Ramsey,
Mr. Kirby is very busy and he...

1611
01:42:59,129 --> 01:43:02,439
Well, Mr. Kirby,
I suppose you're very proud of yourself.

1612
01:43:02,529 --> 01:43:06,522
Another victory.
The greatest of your career.

1613
01:43:07,009 --> 01:43:09,000
What do you want, Ramsey?

1614
01:43:09,089 --> 01:43:10,807
You know something.

1615
01:43:11,049 --> 01:43:14,325
I actually thought of coming here
to ask for mercy...

1616
01:43:14,889 --> 01:43:17,687
...but I couldn't figure out a basis
on which to do it.

1617
01:43:17,769 --> 01:43:19,760
Certainly not friendship.

1618
01:43:19,889 --> 01:43:22,528
Once, a long time ago,
that might have been possible...

1619
01:43:22,609 --> 01:43:26,079
...but you destroyed that, Anthony.
Remember?

1620
01:43:26,569 --> 01:43:28,321
Look at me, Anthony.

1621
01:43:28,449 --> 01:43:31,646
Tomorrow the world will read
that Ramsey is broke.

1622
01:43:31,929 --> 01:43:33,806
Doesn't that please you?

1623
01:43:33,889 --> 01:43:38,167
I've seen men jump out of windows for less,
but I'm going to fool you, Anthony...

1624
01:43:38,529 --> 01:43:41,919
...because I've suddenly realised
I haven't lost a thing...

1625
01:43:42,049 --> 01:43:45,041
...that I never gained
one moment's happiness out of it.

1626
01:43:45,129 --> 01:43:48,007
And I warn you, Anthony,
and neither will you.

1627
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:50,607
In spite of your victories...

1628
01:43:50,689 --> 01:43:53,999
...you can't shut out
every decent impulse and survive.

1629
01:43:54,649 --> 01:43:58,483
You're top-heavy with power right now,
but you'll crack under it.

1630
01:43:58,729 --> 01:44:01,004
You're bound to crack under it.

1631
01:44:01,609 --> 01:44:05,079
You know what is going to happen,
Mr. Anthony P. Kirby?

1632
01:44:05,849 --> 01:44:10,081
You'll scream for help and suddenly
find yourself alone in the world.

1633
01:44:10,529 --> 01:44:14,044
You'll wiggle on the hook
and find that nobody gives a hang.

1634
01:44:14,129 --> 01:44:16,927
I know because that's what happened to me.

1635
01:44:17,129 --> 01:44:18,721
And it will happen to you.

1636
01:44:18,809 --> 01:44:21,607
That's what happens
to all men like us, Anthony.

1637
01:44:21,689 --> 01:44:24,487
It's coming to us, it's coming to us.

1638
01:44:46,609 --> 01:44:49,487
- He's taking it kind of hard.
- Always was a weak sister.

1639
01:44:49,569 --> 01:44:50,558
Sounded crazy to me.

1640
01:44:50,649 --> 01:44:53,561
- They're waiting upstairs. Let's get up.
- Come along.

1641
01:44:53,649 --> 01:44:56,004
Go upstairs and start things.
I'll be up in a minute.

1642
01:44:56,089 --> 01:44:58,683
- But they're waiting.
- I'll be up in a minute.

1643
01:45:09,969 --> 01:45:13,245
- Hello, Dad. May I come in?
- Hello, Son. Come on in.

1644
01:45:13,809 --> 01:45:15,208
How are you?

1645
01:45:15,969 --> 01:45:19,439
Glad to see you. Sit down.
I want to talk to you.

1646
01:45:20,409 --> 01:45:24,084
You know what I always said
about the Kirbys and Tennyson's brook.

1647
01:45:24,289 --> 01:45:25,438
They go on forever.

1648
01:45:25,529 --> 01:45:27,645
If you're talking about
the meeting upstairs...

1649
01:45:27,729 --> 01:45:31,608
...I know all about that. Congratulations.
- Thank you, but that's nothing at all.

1650
01:45:31,689 --> 01:45:32,883
There's more to it than that.

1651
01:45:32,969 --> 01:45:36,245
When I get through with them upstairs,
there will be a new president.

1652
01:45:36,329 --> 01:45:40,527
- Do you know who that's going to be?
- I know you're going to be busy, so I...

1653
01:45:42,369 --> 01:45:43,518
I'm quitting.

1654
01:45:45,289 --> 01:45:46,881
You're quitting?

1655
01:45:47,769 --> 01:45:50,078
I just handed in my resignation.

1656
01:45:50,169 --> 01:45:52,444
I've been thinking about it for a long time...

1657
01:45:52,529 --> 01:45:55,965
So, you're quitting.
What are you going to do?

1658
01:46:03,409 --> 01:46:06,242
I don't know. I think I'll go away for a while.

1659
01:46:07,089 --> 01:46:09,284
Try and get myself organised.

1660
01:46:12,849 --> 01:46:18,003
I was going to hang on to my job until
this thing with Alice got straightened out...

1661
01:46:18,689 --> 01:46:20,645
...but that's all over, so...

1662
01:46:21,369 --> 01:46:23,758
There is no use waiting for that.

1663
01:46:24,569 --> 01:46:26,605
I don't know, I...

1664
01:46:27,249 --> 01:46:31,162
I thought, maybe when I get back,
I could start to work on that grass thing.

1665
01:46:31,249 --> 01:46:34,559
You remember that thing Bob Smith and I
fooled around with in college?

1666
01:46:34,649 --> 01:46:35,718
Yes.

1667
01:46:36,449 --> 01:46:40,408
Dad, if you think it's funny, I'm sorry.
I came in here to say goodbye.

1668
01:46:43,649 --> 01:46:44,877
Goodbye?

1669
01:46:44,969 --> 01:46:47,085
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.

1670
01:46:49,729 --> 01:46:51,845
I don't want any part of this, Dad.

1671
01:46:52,849 --> 01:46:53,998
I never did.

1672
01:46:55,369 --> 01:46:57,803
You can't do this,
after all the plans I made for you...

1673
01:46:57,889 --> 01:47:00,357
If I can just make you understand this.

1674
01:47:00,449 --> 01:47:03,805
I think this business is great.
It's good for you because you like it.

1675
01:47:03,889 --> 01:47:07,006
I don't. And I never will.

1676
01:47:11,329 --> 01:47:15,686
I've tried to talk to you many times about
it, but I couldn't get it out.

1677
01:47:17,689 --> 01:47:21,045
I used to be able to talk to you, Dad...

1678
01:47:21,129 --> 01:47:22,528
...but lately...

1679
01:47:41,169 --> 01:47:43,967
I'll probably be gone
before you get home tonight.

1680
01:47:49,209 --> 01:47:50,642
Goodbye, Dad.

1681
01:47:56,449 --> 01:47:57,882
Goodbye, Son.

1682
01:47:59,489 --> 01:48:04,358
Maybe when I get back, we can sit down
and have a good old-fashioned gabfest.

1683
01:48:06,649 --> 01:48:08,321
Yeah, yeah.

1684
01:48:36,129 --> 01:48:38,199
- Yes.
- It's about Mr. Ramsey, sir.

1685
01:48:38,369 --> 01:48:42,601
They just found him dead in the washroom.
The doctor said it was heart failure.

1686
01:48:50,889 --> 01:48:51,958
Yes?

1687
01:48:52,049 --> 01:48:55,644
- What did you say?
- They just found Mr. Ramsey dead.

1688
01:49:08,609 --> 01:49:12,443
A.P., they're getting impatient upstairs.
I can't hold them any longer.

1689
01:49:33,089 --> 01:49:34,408
Boardroom.

1690
01:49:38,089 --> 01:49:40,523
Get everything set. We're on our way up.

1691
01:49:48,249 --> 01:49:49,602
Hello, Mr. Kirby.

1692
01:49:49,729 --> 01:49:52,118
52nd.

1693
01:49:55,929 --> 01:49:56,998
52nd, sir.

1694
01:50:08,569 --> 01:50:09,638
Take me down.

1695
01:50:09,729 --> 01:50:11,162
- Down?
- Down?

1696
01:50:11,249 --> 01:50:13,524
- We can't postpone this meeting.
- Take me down.

1697
01:50:13,609 --> 01:50:16,043
We've been waiting on you for hours.

1698
01:50:22,289 --> 01:50:25,326
What's the matter, Mr. Kirby?
Is there something wrong?

1699
01:50:36,689 --> 01:50:39,078
Darned if I don't think
they enjoy this moving.

1700
01:50:39,169 --> 01:50:41,683
Don't be silly. It's killing them.

1701
01:50:42,609 --> 01:50:46,158
It's certainly going to be gay around here
when you leave, Grandpa?

1702
01:50:46,249 --> 01:50:49,400
He found the cutest place
near where Alice is, right on the ocean.

1703
01:50:49,489 --> 01:50:52,208
- Lake, Penny. Lake.
- That's what I said, lake.

1704
01:50:52,289 --> 01:50:54,484
We'll invite you all up
to go deep-sea fishing.

1705
01:50:54,569 --> 01:50:57,925
- Gee, Mr. Kolenkhov, isn't it exciting?
- Exciting?

1706
01:50:58,009 --> 01:51:02,127
With you moving and the Grand Duchess
out of a job, where do I eat?

1707
01:51:15,769 --> 01:51:18,966
- Hello, Mr. Vanderhof.
- So you're here again.

1708
01:51:19,049 --> 01:51:21,517
Why won't you tell me where she is?

1709
01:51:21,609 --> 01:51:25,488
Because there's an unwritten law
in our family against snitching.

1710
01:51:25,569 --> 01:51:29,039
But look, Mr. Vanderhof, I just sort of feel...

1711
01:51:29,129 --> 01:51:31,484
...I can talk to you about this thing.

1712
01:51:33,049 --> 01:51:37,122
I've left my job
and I'm going away tonight, and I...

1713
01:51:37,329 --> 01:51:41,481
But I love Alice. And she loves me.
This whole thing is ridiculous.

1714
01:51:41,569 --> 01:51:45,039
I'm convinced, young man,
but you're not marrying me.

1715
01:51:45,329 --> 01:51:47,559
After all, Alice is the woman.

1716
01:51:49,209 --> 01:51:51,279
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1717
01:51:52,129 --> 01:51:55,121
I just thought I'd take a parting shot
before I left.

1718
01:51:55,289 --> 01:51:58,201
I have messed things up beautifully,
haven't I?

1719
01:51:58,289 --> 01:52:01,326
- Yes.
- Well, goodbye, sir.

1720
01:52:01,769 --> 01:52:05,921
The trouble with young squirts nowadays
is they have no imagination.

1721
01:52:06,969 --> 01:52:08,880
They don't use the old bean.

1722
01:52:09,409 --> 01:52:11,923
Well, I'll do anything you say, sir.

1723
01:52:12,569 --> 01:52:15,163
- You want to see Alice again, don't you?
- Yes.

1724
01:52:15,369 --> 01:52:18,406
- And we can't tell you where she is?
- Yes, no, sir.

1725
01:52:18,889 --> 01:52:23,519
There's a big trunk of Alice's upstairs
and they're going to take it where she is.

1726
01:52:23,609 --> 01:52:25,759
Just don't say another word.

1727
01:52:28,049 --> 01:52:29,277
Grandpa!

1728
01:52:31,449 --> 01:52:35,442
I came as soon as I got your telegram.
I'm too late. You've already sold the house.

1729
01:52:35,529 --> 01:52:40,125
- Of course I sold the house. I got tired of it.
- Grandpa, it's all my fault.

1730
01:52:40,209 --> 01:52:44,487
Alice, dear. Alice, we were coming to you.

1731
01:52:44,569 --> 01:52:47,129
Now everybody on the block has to move,
don't they?

1732
01:52:47,209 --> 01:52:49,359
What about Grandma?
You're walking out on her.

1733
01:52:49,449 --> 01:52:52,168
Now, don't be childish, Alice.
The thing is done.

1734
01:52:52,249 --> 01:52:54,683
Now, go on upstairs and pack your things.

1735
01:52:55,329 --> 01:52:57,445
Alice, will you give me a chance
to talk to you?

1736
01:52:57,529 --> 01:53:00,601
They wanted the house and they got it,
the mighty Kirbys.

1737
01:53:00,689 --> 01:53:02,361
What are you doing here anyway?

1738
01:53:02,449 --> 01:53:05,486
Wait a minute. I've something to tell you.
I want you to listen.

1739
01:53:05,569 --> 01:53:06,604
Go ahead and scream.

1740
01:53:06,689 --> 01:53:08,884
That's the way you've gotten everything.

1741
01:53:08,969 --> 01:53:11,767
Scream your head off
and see what it gets you now.

1742
01:53:15,169 --> 01:53:16,363
Alice, Alice.

1743
01:53:17,249 --> 01:53:18,238
Alice.

1744
01:53:27,409 --> 01:53:29,001
I sure feel sorry for Grandpa.

1745
01:53:29,089 --> 01:53:32,968
I walked in the room and he was looking
at a picture of Grandma and he was crying.

1746
01:53:33,049 --> 01:53:34,038
Crying?

1747
01:53:34,129 --> 01:53:38,839
He got sore, too, because he caught me
looking at him, and threw something at me.

1748
01:53:38,929 --> 01:53:42,126
There's only one thing worrying me.
Have they got relief up there?

1749
01:53:42,209 --> 01:53:44,643
Sure they have.
They've got relief everywhere now.

1750
01:53:44,729 --> 01:53:46,128
- There is?
- Yeah.

1751
01:53:46,209 --> 01:53:48,598
Let's get on up there then.

1752
01:53:50,529 --> 01:53:52,565
I guess we've moved everything out of here.

1753
01:53:52,649 --> 01:53:54,480
Yes, that's about all.

1754
01:54:00,649 --> 01:54:03,163
Here's one that didn't go off.

1755
01:54:11,489 --> 01:54:13,605
Be careful with it. Especially the typewriter.

1756
01:54:13,689 --> 01:54:17,364
I have a feeling that I'm going to do
my best work at our new place.

1757
01:54:20,249 --> 01:54:21,648
Oh, Dad.

1758
01:54:21,729 --> 01:54:26,007
Oh, now, Penny,
we've had enough wailing for one day.

1759
01:54:40,649 --> 01:54:45,165
- Do you mind if I come in?
- No, not at all. Come right in.

1760
01:54:51,609 --> 01:54:54,077
We aren't quite prepared for visitors, but...

1761
01:54:54,169 --> 01:54:56,637
Donald, put that chair down for Mr. Kirby.

1762
01:54:56,729 --> 01:54:59,721
Let me have that stool, too,
will you, Donald, please?

1763
01:55:01,809 --> 01:55:02,844
Thank you.

1764
01:55:04,769 --> 01:55:08,557
- Mr. Vanderhof, could we be alone?
- Oh, sure. Penny.

1765
01:55:09,209 --> 01:55:10,278
Thank you.

1766
01:55:13,529 --> 01:55:15,918
I don't know, Grandpa is talking to him.

1767
01:55:19,969 --> 01:55:23,279
Mr. Vanderhof, you once told me
I was a failure as a father.

1768
01:55:24,009 --> 01:55:27,763
- I didn't mean that.
- I know, but I am.

1769
01:55:29,169 --> 01:55:32,366
Tony's walked out on me
and it's just about wrecked me.

1770
01:55:33,249 --> 01:55:36,844
Mr. Kirby, you're beginning to act
quite human.

1771
01:55:38,209 --> 01:55:41,167
Look, you know about these things.
I don't.

1772
01:55:41,529 --> 01:55:45,078
- I need your advice. I'd give a fortune to...
- Now...

1773
01:55:45,729 --> 01:55:48,926
...you've got to stop thinking
in terms of fortune.

1774
01:55:50,049 --> 01:55:53,405
Do you know what I do
when I run smack into a crisis?

1775
01:55:54,929 --> 01:55:58,365
I just take out my harmonica
and I play on it...

1776
01:55:58,449 --> 01:56:01,009
...until that crisis just fades away.

1777
01:56:01,169 --> 01:56:04,320
- Now, please don't joke about this...
- I'm not joking about it.

1778
01:56:04,409 --> 01:56:07,321
You asked my advice
and I'm giving it to you.

1779
01:56:07,409 --> 01:56:11,641
I think if we played a duet together,
you and I, on the harmonica...

1780
01:56:12,089 --> 01:56:15,525
- You brought it with you, didn't you?
- Well, I...

1781
01:56:16,129 --> 01:56:17,642
Oh, yes, fine.

1782
01:56:18,089 --> 01:56:23,163
Now, let's play a duet good and loud.
You'll be surprised at what might happen.

1783
01:56:25,089 --> 01:56:27,000
Let's see, what shall we play?

1784
01:56:27,809 --> 01:56:29,845
Do you know Polly Wolly Doodle?

1785
01:56:29,929 --> 01:56:32,079
- You ought to know it.
- Polly Wolly Doodle?

1786
01:56:32,169 --> 01:56:34,763
We drove you almost crazy with it once.

1787
01:56:39,209 --> 01:56:41,165
You know it, of course you do.

1788
01:56:41,689 --> 01:56:46,205
Let's play it good and loud, and swing it.

1789
01:57:02,769 --> 01:57:04,282
What's that, Grandpa?

1790
01:57:04,489 --> 01:57:06,400
Come on, Essie, let's get hot.

1791
01:57:09,409 --> 01:57:10,603
Come on.

1792
01:58:30,809 --> 01:58:33,721
My Russian wrestling friend, eh?

1793
01:58:40,329 --> 01:58:43,002
Magnificent, magnificent.

1794
01:58:43,849 --> 01:58:45,248
Thank you.

1795
01:58:46,929 --> 01:58:50,239
- Is my son here?
- You'll be surprised.

1796
01:58:58,129 --> 01:58:59,448
Anthony.

1797
01:59:00,249 --> 01:59:02,604
Hello, Mother, come on.
You do the Big Apple, too.

1798
01:59:02,689 --> 01:59:04,919
Mr. Sycamore, you show her
how to do the Big Apple.

1799
01:59:05,009 --> 01:59:06,601
Come on. Why not?

1800
01:59:22,609 --> 01:59:24,122
Quiet, please.

1801
01:59:24,449 --> 01:59:26,201
Quiet.

1802
01:59:27,889 --> 01:59:29,959
Well, sir, here we are again.

1803
01:59:30,049 --> 01:59:34,804
We've had quite a time of it lately,
but it seems that the worst of it is over.

1804
01:59:34,889 --> 01:59:39,485
Of course, the fireworks all blew up,
but we can't very well blame that on you.

1805
01:59:40,249 --> 01:59:43,878
Anyway, everything's turned out fine
as it usually does.

1806
01:59:44,329 --> 01:59:46,559
Alice is going to marry Tony.

1807
01:59:46,809 --> 01:59:51,599
Mr. Kirby, who's turned out to be
a good egg, has sold us back our house...

1808
01:59:52,169 --> 01:59:55,798
...and he'll probably forget
all about big deals for a while.

1809
01:59:56,489 --> 02:00:01,358
Nobody on our block has to move.
And with the right handling...

1810
02:00:01,449 --> 02:00:05,442
...I think we can even thaw out
Mrs. Kirby in time.

1811
02:00:06,409 --> 02:00:10,402
We've all got our health,
and as far as anything else is concerned...

1812
02:00:10,489 --> 02:00:12,559
...we still leave that up to you.

1813
02:00:13,049 --> 02:00:14,118
Thank you.

1814
02:00:14,209 --> 02:00:15,642
Bring it on, Rheba.

1815
02:00:16,089 --> 02:00:18,603
Now it is two easy lessons, Mrs. Kirby...

1816
02:00:22,449 --> 02:00:24,007
No holds barred.

1817
02:00:24,089 --> 02:00:26,319
I hope you like it, Mr. Kirby.
