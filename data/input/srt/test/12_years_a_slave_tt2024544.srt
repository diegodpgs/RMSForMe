1
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:12,535
All right now. Y'all fresh niggers.

2
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,245
Y'all gonna be in a cutting gang.

3
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,457
Very simple. I want you to take your knife.

4
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,371
Get in them cane.

5
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,415
Make it sing.

6
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,459
Take the cane out.

7
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,922
Cut my tops.

8
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,213
Clean the shucks off.

9
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:31,013
Throw it on a pile for the planting gang.

10
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,769
Now, them cane ain't gonna jump up and bite you.

11
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:34,928
Don't shy back.

12
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,938
Rush here, boys! Rush here!

13
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,939
# My Lord #

14
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,445

00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,900
# My ma #

18
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,363
# She dead #

19
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,743
# My pa #

20
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,199
# He dead #

21
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,579
# My Lord #

22
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:54,956

# Sunshine #

25
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,206
# Is late #

26
00:01:59,369 --> 00:01:59,869
# In high #

00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,212
# My Lord #

28
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,718
# Sunshine #

00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,049
# My Lord #

00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,633
# Lord, Lord #

31
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,048
# My ma #

32
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,466
# She dead #

33
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,885
# My pa #

34
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,394
# He dead #

35
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,804
# My Lord #

36
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,313
# Sunshine #

37
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,815
# My Lord #

38
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,225
# Yes, sir #

39
00:05:59,094 --> 00:06:02,188


40
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,188
All right, all right, all right, all right.

41
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:12,895
Into bed.

42
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,026
Into bed. Thank you for the music.

43
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,437
- Come on. 
- Ouch.

44
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,230
Get in there. Come on.

45
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,024
Give me a kiss.

46
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:25,737
I love you, Margaret.

47
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,614
I love you, too.

48
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,874
Sleep well.

49
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,207
I'll take this.

50
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,425
I don't want to hear any more noise.

51
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,059
Three weeks and two days.

52
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,395
It is the custom.

53
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,810
I wonder what you will do without me.

54
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,612
I won't stay idle.

55
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,237
Darling, it's good money.

56
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,572
If only I didn't have to share your cooking with other people.

57
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,996
You don't.

58
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,924
Be good for your mother. Okay, Alonzo?

59
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,921
Can I get a kiss, please? Thank you.

60
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,588
Travel safely.

61
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,177
Stay safely.

62
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,765
Ready?

63
00:08:47,246 --> 00:08:49,087
Devil call his name, there he is now.

64
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,455
Mr. Northup!

65
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,332
I have two gentlemen whose acquaintance you should make.

66
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,493
Misters Brown and Hamilton.

67
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,786
Sir.

68
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,796
Mr. Northup, these two gentlemen...

69
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,378
were inquiring about distinguished individuals...

70
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,214
and I was just this very moment...

71
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,550
saying Solomon Northup is an expert player on the violin.

72
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:07,885
He was indeed.

73
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,132
Mr. Moon is being overly gracious.

74
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,676
Well, taking into consideration

75
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,222
his graciousness and your modesty...

76
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,389
may we trouble you for a moment of your time to converse, sir?

77
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,807
Of course.

78
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,349
Good day.

79
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,980
A circus?

80
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,286
That is our usual employee.

81
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,858
The company currently in the city of Washington.

82
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,739
Circus is too constricting a word...

83
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,401
to describe the talented and merry band with which we travel.

84
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,491
It is a spectacle unlike most have ever witnessed.

85
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,326
Creatures from the darkest Africa

86
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,074
as yet unseen by civilized man.

87
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,662
Acrobats from the Orient...

88
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,845
who contort themselves in the most confounding manners.

89
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,872
And I myself in aide of Mr. Brown...

90
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,712
an internationally renowned practitioner

91
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,550
in the art of prestidigitation.

92
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,086
We are on our way thither to rejoin

93
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,588
the company having left for a short time...

94
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,882
to make a small profit from our own exhibitions.

95
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,728
The reason for our inquiry with Mr. Moon...

96
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,635
Yes. We had just a devil of a time

97
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,512
in procuring music for our entertainments.

98
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,680
Men of true talents are seemingly in short supply.

99
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:58,848
Thank you, sir.

100
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,939
If we could persuade you to accompany us as far as Washington...

101
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,525
We could give you one dollar for each day's services...

102
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,087
and three dollars for every night played at our performances.

103
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,084
In addition, we would provide sufficient pay...

104
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,204
for your return here to Saratoga, two weeks from today.

105
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,620
Welcome to Washington, Solomon.

106
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,429
Hamilton, you know too much.

107
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,089
Some say not enough.

108
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,973
Solomon, 43 dollars. All to you.

109
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,062
That is far more than my wages amount to.

110
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,768
It's been a most profitable week, sir.

111
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,225
- Cheers. 
- Cheers.

112
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,608
Cheers.

113
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,732
Another.

114
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:55,281
Gentlemen, your generosity is extraordinary.

115
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,494
And your talents are undeniable.

116
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,704
Mmm. To Solomon.

117
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,370
Cheers.

118
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,620
Ugh!

119
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,665
It's all right, Solomon.

120
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:47,957
There's no shame in it.

121
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,546
No shame at all.

122
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,517
Hamilton, we must hurry.

123
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,460
One too many libation.

124
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,836
We're halfway there.

125
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,104
So sorry...

126
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,140
We won't hear it. We won't.

127
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,318
Let him sleep, Hamilton.

128
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,892
Mmm. A good night's rest.

129
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,147
And tomorrow...

130
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,522
tomorrow you will feel as well and refreshed

131
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,896
as if the earth were new again.

132
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,815
Hamilton, there's nothing more we can do for him.

133
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,001
Such is the pity.

134
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,331
Well, boy, how do you feel now?

135
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:15,591
My name... My name is Solomon Northup.

136
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:19,007
I'm a free man. A resident of Saratoga, New York.

137
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,801
The residence of my wife and children who are equally free.

138
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,845
And you have no right whatsoever to detain me.

139
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,389
You're not any free man.

140
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,852
And I promise you...

141
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,188
I promise you upon my liberation

142
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,482
I will have satisfaction for this wrong.

143
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,614
Resolve this.

144
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,570
Produce your papers.

145
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,242
You're no free man.

146
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,832
And you ain't from Saratoga.

147
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,247
You're from Georgia.

148
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,503
You ain't a free man.

149
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:02,388
You're nothing but a Georgia runaway.

150
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:09,100
You're just a runaway nigger...

151
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,517
from Georgia.

152
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,472
You're a slave!

153
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,612
You're a Georgia slave!

154
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,035
Are you a slave?

155
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,495
No.

156
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,051
Help.

157
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,020
Help me.

158
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,186
Help me!

159
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,227
Somebody help me!

160
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,063
Help!

161
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,358
Help!

162
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,876
That old thing of yours is just rags and tatters.

163
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,508
You need something proper to wear.

164
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,884
Go on, put it on.

165
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,576
There.

166
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,326
That's fine.

167
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,704
That's fine.

168
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,078
Got no gratitude?

169
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,501
No. That's from my wife.

170
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,215
Rags and tatters.

171
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,884
Rags and tatters.

172
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,642
Go on, wash up.

173
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,363
The boy, too. Get him clean.

174
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,401
Scrub now.

175
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,741
Do you know when my mama will come?

176
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,296
Hush him up!

177
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,322
Mama! Mama!

178
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,490
Quiet.

179
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,125
- Quiet, please. 
- Mama!

180
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,410
Hush him up!

181
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,956
Your mother will come, I swear she will. But you must be silent.

182
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,007
Be silent.

183
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,607
We need a sympathetic ear.

184
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,469
An opportunity to explain our situation.

185
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,637
Who, in your estimation, is that sympathetic ear?

186
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,522
The two men I journeyed with.

187
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,558
I'm certain they're making enquiries at this very moment.

188
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,068
I'd be just as certain they're counting

189
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,527
the money paid for delivering you to this place.

190
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,735
They were not kidnappers, they were artists. Fellow performers.

191
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,365
You know that?

192
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,526
You know for certain who they were?

193
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:36,370
The reality to come is us being transported southward.

194
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,626
New Orleans, if I was to venture.

195
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,746
After we arrive, we'll be put to market.

196
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,539
And beyond that...

197
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,935
Well, I suppose once in a slave state, there's only one outcome.

198
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:47,714
No.

199
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,877
I don't say that to give you empty agitation, John.

200
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,631
For y'all, there ain't nothing but that.

201
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,265
But John wasn't kidnapped.

202
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,847
John's just being held as debt, that's all.

203
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,933
Master pay his debt and John be redeemed.

204
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,575
Boy, our masters will not come for us.

205
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,724
John is sorry for y'all, but that's how it be.

206
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,734
Where you're going, you're going without John.

207
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,113
- Mama! 
- Randall!

208
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:09,858
Mama!

209
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,407
Are you all right?

210
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,450
Are you all right?

211
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,703
Thank you, God.

212
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,411
Come on. Get up.

213
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,292
- I said, get up! 
- No, don't...

214
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,378
I don't want to hear you talk! Get in the yard.

215
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,587
Not my children!

216
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,095
Ain't no need for all that. Just taking a little trip, that's all.

217
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,347
Don't want to frighten the children

218
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,091
over a little boat ride, do you?

219
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,930
John's master gonna pay his debt.

220
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,094
Line up!

221
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,445
His master gonna pay his debt!

222
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,941
I don't want to hear a word out of none of you!

223
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,281
Not a one.

224
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,879
All right, come on.

225
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,291
Move. Come on.

226
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,377
Come on, child. Come on.

227
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,046
Follow your mama.

228
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,271
Come on, boy.

229
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,356
Up these stairs.

230
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,634
Get down out of that wagon. Come on.

231
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,636
Come on. Move it!

232
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,479
Let's go!

233
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,980
Up, up, up the stairs.

234
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,770
Come on, let's go.

235
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,773
Come on, move it!

236
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,691
All right, come on.

237
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,741
Hey, you. Get up.

238
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,822
Sit down, right there.

239
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,166
Come on.

240
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,583
Right there. Just sit down.

241
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,084
Cheer up and don't be so cast down.

242
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:39,428
If you want to survive, do and say as little as possible.

243
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:45,138
Tell no one who you really are and tell no one you can read and write.

244
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:50,242
Unless you want to be a dead nigger.

245
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,334
Now keep your mouth shut.

246
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,927
I say we fight.

247
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,422
The crew is fairly small.

248
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,608
Were it well planned, I believe they could be strong-armed.

249
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,510
Three can't go against the whole crew.

250
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,638
The rest here are niggers.

251
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,349
Born and bred slaves.

252
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,768
Niggers ain't got no stomach for a fight.

253
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,277
Not a damn one.

254
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:37,235
All's I know, if we get where we're traveling...

255
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,070
we'll wish we'd died trying.

256
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,702
Survival's not about certain death,

257
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:44,322
it's about keeping your head down.

258
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:50,127
Days ago, I was with my family...

259
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,460
in my home.

260
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,343
Now you tell me all is lost.

261
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,681
"Tell no one who I am." That's the way to survive?

262
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,974
Well, I don't want to survive.

263
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,642
I want to live.

264
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,070
Better off.

265
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,571
Better than us.

266
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,836
I don't see him.

267
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:04,720
Clemens!

268
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,717
- Clemens Ray! 
- Master!

269
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,097
- Clemens! 
- Master Ray, sir!

270
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,509
Master Ray!

271
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:10,796
Who's in charge here?

272
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:11,927
I'm the captain!

273
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,266
I'm Mr. Jonus Ray.

274
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,022
My solicitor has documentation...

275
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,933
verifying the negro known as Clemens Ray is my property.

276
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,444
I know nothing of this arrangement.

277
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,454
You are ordered to return that property

278
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,231
immediately or be charged with thievery.

279
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:26,693
Free him!

280
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,737
Master.

281
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,702
Master Ray, sir.

282
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,083
Clemens!

283
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,442
- Clemens! 
- Get him back!

284
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:37,954
Clemens!

285
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,621
Clemens!

286
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,381
Clemens!

287
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,083
Mr. Parker.

288
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:52,408
Ah, Mr. Northup. Mrs. Northup.

289
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,701
Solomon, could I interest you in a new cravat?

290
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,173
Pure silk, by way of the French.

291
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,872
We're in need of a fresh carryall for my Mrs.'s travels.

292
00:26:59,034 --> 00:26:59,876
Nothing more.

293
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,708
The year has passed already.

294
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,180
Off to work at Sandy Hill again?

295
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,047
I am.

296
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:05,549
I have just the thing.

297
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,380
Something to suit your style...

298
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:10,012
and yet sturdy enough for the 40-mile round trip.

299
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,171
It's beautiful.

300
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,260
At what price?

301
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,348
We will take it.

302
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:16,636
Children, come see what you father has just purchased for me.

303
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,363
One moment, sir, and you'll be assisted.

304
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,188
- Mr. Parker. 
- Sir?

305
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,564
If we could discuss the price.

306
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,350
Oh, forgive me, Solomon. Forgive me, Mrs. Northup.

307
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:25,565
A customer waits. Welcome, sir.

308
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,570
Shop well, sir, but mind your wallet.

309
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,530
Pay no attention to this gentleman's nonsense.

310
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:30,740
Jasper!

311
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,032
My regrets for the intrusion, sir.

312
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,076
No intrusion.

313
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,376
Good day, sir.

314
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,041
Good day.

315
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,921
Jasper, out.

316
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,341
Very good. Very good.

317
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:58,265
Let's see, here. Eliza!

318
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,893
Stand up when you hear your name. Eliza.

319
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:03,606
Lethe!

320
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:07,690
John.

321
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:10,690
Oren.

322
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,112
Platt.

323
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,120
Platt.

324
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,742
Stand up.

325
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,124
You fit the description given.

326
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,630
Why didn't you answer when called?

327
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,040
My name is not Platt.

328
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,049
My name...

329
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,094
Your name is Platt.

330
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,470
Captain, get these niggers to my cart.

331
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,317
Mmm.

332
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:00,830
Move.

333
00:29:04,418 --> 00:29:06,178
I believe I have something very much

334
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:07,796
to your liking in the back room.

335
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,673
Follow me, please.

336
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,675
Yes. Now, inspect them at your leisure...

337
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:17,681
but I ask you to pay particular regard to young Ezra here.

338
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,091
Incredibly sound limbs.

339
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,352
I have never seen anything quite like him.

340
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,354
And this marvelous creature. Can you believe it? Mmm?

341
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,186
She'll make a fine lady's maid.

342
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:27,520
Madam?

343
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,522
So, inspect at your leisure.

344
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,983
Take your time. Help yourself to refreshments.

345
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:35,149
Gentlemen, what catches your fancy here? Hmm?

346
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:36,650
This boy? Yes?

347
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,990
Open your mouth. Open wider.

348
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,530
Look in there. Never been sick a day in his life.

349
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,340
And I call particular attention to Martha.

350
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,834
She is an excellent pastry cook.

351
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,711
Ah, Mr. Ford.

352
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,459
Splendid seeing you, sir. What catches your fancy?

353
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,670
This lad? He's very brawny.

354
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,644
How much for the ones Platt and Eliza?

355
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,216
Ah, yes.

356
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,856
A thousand for Platt. Uh... Oh.

357
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,680
This is a nigger of considerable talent, I assure you.

358
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:04,561
700 for Eliza.

359
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,393
My fairest price.

360
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:07,894
Mmm.

361
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:09,896
You will accept a note?

362
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,652
Please, sir. Do not divide my family.

363
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,063
Do not take me unless you take my children.

364
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,230
Eliza! Quiet!

365
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,117
You will have the most faithful slave in me.

366
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,617
The most faithful slave that has ever lived.

367
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:19,901
But I beg that you do not separate us.

368
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,074
Your price for the boy?

369
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,579
Eliza! Stop it!

370
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:23,910
I will give you something to cry about.

371
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,245
Randall, come forward. Come, come, come.

372
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,627
Now, do you see how fit this boy is?

373
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,037
Like ripe fruit.

374
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:33,082
May I take your stick a moment? Observe this.

375
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,250
Randall, jump, jump, jump. Run, run, run.

376
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,590
Very good! Higher.

377
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:38,879
Now, you see this.

378
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:42,641
It's very likely he will grow into a fine beast.

379
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,602
600 for the boy.

380
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,263
Fair and final.

381
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,105
Done.

382
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,608
Superb. A moment, please.

383
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,064
Mr. Ford.

384
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,440
- Please. 
- Eliza!

385
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,413
How much for the little girl?

386
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:57,530
Ah...

387
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,111
You have no use for her.

388
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,947
One so young will bring you no profit.

389
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,952
No, no, no. I cannot sell the girl.

390
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:06,741
No, there's heaps and piles of money to be made from her.

391
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:09,205
She's a beauty. One of the regular bloods.

392
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:12,168
None of your thick-lipped, bullet-heated, cotton-picking niggers, here.

393
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,961
Her child, man.

394
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:16,125
Please.

395
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,371
For God's sake, are you not sentimental in the least?

396
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,130
My sentimentality extends the length of a coin.

397
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,798
God, please.

398
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,719
Now do you take this lot, Mr. Ford, or do you pass on them?

399
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:30,480
Please, please. Please.

400
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,186
I will take the ones Platt and Eliza.

401
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,350
Sold, Eliza and Platt.

402
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:34,643
I will not go without my children!

403
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:35,860
Goddamn sniveling wench!

404
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,287
You will not take them from me!

405
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,031
God damn you! Get her out of here, Cape!

406
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,908
Please! No! No!

407
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,694
Get her out of here, god damn it!

408
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,830
Platt, get your fiddle. Play, play, play something.

409
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:50,083
I will give you something to cry about, you goddamned witch!

410
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,415
Get her out of here, Cape! Out, now!

411
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:56,040
Mama! Mama! Mama!

412
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,963
Yes.

413
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,845
Mr. Ford, a pleasure.

414
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,693
Did you bring all those niggers?

415
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,109
Two of them? You got two?

416
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:24,822
Mr. Chapin.

417
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,913
This one's crying. Why is this one crying?

418
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,698
Separated from her children.

419
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,287
- Oh, dear. 
- It couldn't be helped.

420
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,702
Poor, poor woman.

421
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,120
- Mr. Chapin. 
- Yes, sir.

422
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:35,754
Tomorrow, you have to take these two

423
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,373
up to the mill and start them working.

424
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:38,756
For now, make them adequate.

425
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,716
Fix them a meal and have them rest themselves.

426
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,048
Yes, sir.

427
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,178
Come on, now.

428
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,886
Come on! Don't dawdle!

429
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,802
Something to eat, and some rest.

430
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,408
Your children will soon be forgotten.

431
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:21,000
For all of you raw niggers that don't know...

432
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:25,546
my name is John Tibeats, William Ford's chief carpenter.

433
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:29,091
You will refer to me as "Master."

434
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,978
Mr. Chapin is the overseer on this plantation.

435
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:37,687
You, too, will refer to him as "Master."

436
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,731
So, clap your hands.

437
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,991
Like this. Come on.

438
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,115
Come on, now. Clap your hands.

439
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,543
# Nigger run Nigger flew #

440
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,079
# Nigger tore his shirt in two #

441
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,590
# Run, run The Pattyroller will get you #

442
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,796
# Run, nigger, run Well, you better get away #

443
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,215
That's right. Like you mean it.

444
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:13,431
# Nigger run Run so fast #

445
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,937
# Stove his head in a hornet's nest #

446
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,064
# Run, run The Pattyroller will get you #

447
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:21,227
# Run, nigger, run Well, you better get away #

448
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,321
# nigger, run The Pattyroller will get you #

449
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,652
# Run, nigger, run Well, you better get away #

450
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,652
# Some folk say a nigger don't steal #

451
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,992
# I caught three in my corn field #

452
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,327
# One has a bushel And one has a peck #

453
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,663
# One has a rope It was hung around his neck #

454
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:40,249
# Run nigger, run The Pattyroller will get you #

455
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,665
# Run, nigger, run Well, you better get away #

456
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,004
# Run nigger, run The Pattyroller will get you #

457
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,840
# Run, nigger, run Well, you better get away #

458
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,347
# Hey, Mr. Pattyroller Don't catch me #

459
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,849
# Catch that nigger behind that tree #

460
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:55,352
# Run nigger, run The Pattyroller will get you #

461
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,729
# Run, nigger, run Well, you better get away #

462
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,015
# Run nigger, run The Pattyroller will get you #

463
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,354
# Run, nigger, run Well, you better get away #

464
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,690
# Run nigger, run The Pattyroller will get you #

465
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,855
# Run, nigger, run Well, you better get away #

466
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,154
"I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac...

467
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:12,658
and the God of Jacob.

468
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,531
And when the multitude heard this,

469
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,371
they were astonished at his doctrine.

470
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,170
And then one of them, which was a lawyer...

471
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:25,549
asked him a question, tempting him."

472
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:23,769
The creek is plenty deep enough to sail.

473
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,485
Even with a boat full of load.

474
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:27,843
The distance from the work area

475
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,944
to the point on the latter bayou...

476
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,822
is several miles by water fewer than land.

477
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,527
It occurs to me that the expense of transportation

478
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,242
would be materially diminished...

479
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:35,448
"Materially diminished"?

480
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,578
If we use the waterway.

481
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,490
Are you an engineer, or a nigger?

482
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:45,287
Are you an engineer, or a nigger?

483
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,626
Let the man say his piece.

484
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:51,464
It's a scheme. Plenty of engineers have schemed similarly.

485
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,175
The passes are too tight.

486
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,633
I reckon them at more than 12 feet at their most narrow.

487
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,301
Wide enough for a tub to traverse

488
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:00,848
if a team of niggers cleared it out.

489
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,763
And you know what of transport and terraforming?

490
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,648
I labored repairing the Champlain canal...

491
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:09,152
on the section over which William Van Nortwick was superintendent.

492
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,189
With my earnings, I hired several efficient hands to assist me...

493
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,652
and entered into contracts for

494
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,070
the transportation of large rafts of timber...

495
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,702
from Lake Champlain to Troy.

496
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,492
Well, I'll admit to being impressed even if you won't.

497
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,582
Collect a team. See what good you can do.

498
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,922
You good? Clear it out!

499
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,356
Two, three...

500
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,353
# Too late for me #

501
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,561
# I live or die #

502
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:50,853
# Lay down and cry #

503
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:54,114
# Hey, boy I'm tired #

504
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,367
# My lord Sometimes #

505
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,779
# I'm strong Yes, sir #

506
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:04,324
# I'm tall Yes, sir #

507
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,298
Platt, you are a marvel.

508
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,682
What took you so long?

509
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,306
Thank you, Master Ford.

510
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,204
Platt.

511
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,635
My great thanks, Master Ford.

512
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,895
No, my thanks to you.

513
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,351
And it is the least of it.

514
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:12,768
I hope it brings us both much joy over the years.

515
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,636
God!

516
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,642
Eliza.

517
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:56,979
Eliza.

518
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:58,730
Stop!

519
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,149
Stop your wailing!

520
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,032
If you let yourself be overcome

521
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:06,621
by sorrow, you will drown in it.

522
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,497
Have you stopped crying for your children?

523
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:13,829
You make no sounds, but will you ever let them go in your heart?

524
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,001
They are as my flesh.

525
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,170
Then who is distressed?

526
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,174
Do I upset the master and the mistress?

527
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,684
Do you care less about my loss than their well-being?

528
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,185
Master Ford is a decent man.

529
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:30,470
He is a slaver!

530
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:31,654
Under the circumstances.

531
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,477
Under the circumstances, he is a slaver.

532
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,683
But you truckle at his boot.

533
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,477
You luxuriate in his favor.

534
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,362
I survive!

535
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,568
I will not fall into despair!

536
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:43,699
I will offer up my talents to Master Ford!

537
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,657
I will keep myself hearty until freedom is opportune!

538
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,867
Ford is your opportunity?

539
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,409
You think he does not know that you are more than you suggest?

540
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,248
But he does nothing for you.

541
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,582
Nothing.

542
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:59,504
You are no better than prized livestock.

543
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,418
Call for him. Call!

544
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,712
Tell him of your previous circumstances,

545
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,051
and see what it earns you, Solomon.

546
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:10,392
So, you've settled into your role as Platt, then?

547
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:15,615
My back is thick with scars...

548
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,063
for protesting my freedom.

549
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:19,648
Do not accuse me.

550
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:24,073
I accuse you of nothing. I cannot accuse.

551
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:27,156
I have done dishonorable things to survive...

552
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,322
and for all of them, I have ended up here.

553
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,871
No better than if I stood up for myself.

554
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,745
God, forgive me.

555
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,710
Solomon, let me weep for my children!

556
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,185
"Whosoever, therefore, shall humble

557
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,429
himself as this little child...

558
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:58,775
the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

559
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:03,860
And who so shall receive one such little child in my name..."

560
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,865
I cannot have that kind of depression about.

561
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,197
"But who so shall offend one of these little ones...

562
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,254
it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck...

563
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,125
and he were drowned in the depth of the sea."

564
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,202
Amen.

565
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:19,917
Amen.

566
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,811
Make them boards flush.

567
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,141
They are, sir.

568
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,306
No, they is no such thing.

569
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:43,061
They are as smooth to the touch as a yearling's coat.

570
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,569
Are you calling me a liar, boy?

571
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,829
It's all a matter of perspective, sir.

572
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:55,131
From where you stand, you may see differently,

573
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,783
but the hands are not mistaken.

574
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:01,580
I simply ask that you use all your senses before rendering judgment.

575
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:06,342
Oh, my, you are a brute.

576
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,428
You are a dog.

577
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,762
And no better for following instruction!

578
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,193
I do as ordered.

579
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:16,418
Then you'll be up at daybreak.

580
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,351
You will procure a keg of nails from Chapin...

581
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,516
and commence to putting on clapboards.

582
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:22,854
Yes, sir.

583
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,987
Make them boards flush.

584
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,369
No, please! Please, Sam!

585
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:43,880
Where am I going? Where am I going, Sam?

586
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:46,875
Solomon! Solomon!

587
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,713
Solomon!

588
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,342
Solomon!

589
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,055
Solomon!

590
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,818
When I say I had my Master's favor, you understand.

591
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:09,522
And for nine years...

592
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:13,569
he blessed me with every comfort and luxury in life.

593
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:16,203
Silks and jewels...

594
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,831
and even servants to wait upon us.

595
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,331
Such was our life.

596
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,373
And the life of this beautiful girl I bore for him.

597
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,715
But Master Berry's daughter...

598
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,549
she always looked at me with an unkind nature.

599
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:40,061
And she hated Emily, no matter she and Emily were flesh of flesh.

600
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,849
As Master Berry's health failed,

601
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:46,601
she gained power of the household...

602
00:44:47,024 --> 00:44:49,745
and eventually, I was brought to the city under the false pretense...

603
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,569
of our free papers being executed.

604
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:58,909
My poor children.

605
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,614
I thought I told you to commence to putting on clapboards.

606
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:44,500
Yes, Master, I'm about it. These have all been replaced.

607
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,913
And didn't I tell you to get a keg of nails?

608
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,752
And so, I did.

609
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,924
So, you did.

610
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,674
God damn you. I thought you knowed something!

611
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,338
I did as instructed.

612
00:45:57,505 --> 00:46:00,725
If there's something wrong, it's wrong with the instruction.

613
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,177
You black bastard.

614
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:08,600
You goddamn black bastard.

615
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,814
Strip your clothes.

616
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,317
Strip.

617
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,861
I will not.

618
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:32,542
You will not live to see another day, nigger!

619
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,674
Help!

620
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,716
Murder!

621
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,011
I'm sorry!

622
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,889
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

623
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,526
What is the matter?

624
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,190
What is the matter?

625
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,439
Master Tibeats wants to whip me

626
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:58,040
for using the nails you gave me.

627
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:01,987
This ain't done by half.

628
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:04,664
I will have flesh.

629
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,075
And I will have all of it!

630
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:11,837
Do not stir.

631
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:15,709
Do not leave the plantation. For, if you run, I cannot protect you.

632
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:17,756
Stay here.

633
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:25,073
Gentlemen, whoever moves that nigger is a dead man.

634
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:29,870
I am the overseer on this plantation.

635
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,751
William Ford holds the mortgage on Platt.

636
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,668
If you hang him, he will lose his debt.

637
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,503
You have no claim to his life.

638
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,505
As for you two...

639
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:43,672
if you have any regard for your own safety...

640
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:44,805
I say, be gone!

641
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,227
You got no cause!

642
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:53,856
Platt is mine, and mine to do with as I please!

643
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,937
If you touch...

644
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:22,964
Sam!

645
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,092
Fetch the mule. Get Master Ford.

646
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:23,266
Platt. Poor Platt.

647
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,347
I believe Tibeats is skulking about the premises somewhere.

648
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:58,726
He wants you dead, and he will have it so.

649
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:01,103
It's no longer safe for you here.

650
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:05,061
And I don't believe you will remain passive if Tibeats attacks.

651
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:08,273
I have transferred my debt to Edwin Epps.

652
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,358
He will take charge...

653
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,714
Master Ford.

654
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:37,840
You must know that I'm not a slave.

655
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,345
I cannot hear that.

656
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:41,476
Before I came to you, I was a freeman.

657
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:44,309
I'm trying to save your life!

658
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:48,021
And I have a debt to be mindful of.

659
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:52,442
And that is to Edwin Epps now.

660
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:55,403
And he is a hard man. Prides himself on being a nigger breaker.

661
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:58,615
But truthfully, I could find no others who would take you.

662
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,697
You've made a reputation of yourself.

663
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:07,165
Whatever the circumstances, you are an exceptional nigger, Platt.

664
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,878
But I fear no good will come of it.

665
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,403
"And that servant...

666
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:40,115
which knew his lord's will..."

667
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:44,953
Which knew his lord's will.

668
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,710
"And prepared not himself..."

669
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,876
Prepared not himself.

670
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:02,596
"Neither did according to his will..."

671
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:07,725
shall be beaten with many stripes."

672
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:10,524
Do you hear that?

673
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:12,526
"Stripes."

674
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:15,897
That nigger that don't obey his lord...

675
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:18,111
that's his master, do you see?

676
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:23,617
That there nigger shall be beaten with many stripes.

677
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:29,039
Now, "many" signifies a great many.

678
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:33,422
40, 100, 150 lashes.

679
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,678
That's scripture.

680
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,608
Pick that cotton.

681
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,694
Move along, now.

682
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:04,786
Come on, Edward! Drive them niggers!

683
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:07,949
Pick that cotton! Move along, now.

684
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,625
What are you doing, boy? Come on!

685
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,672
240 for Bob.

686
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:18,091
What you got for James?

687
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,628
295 pounds.

688
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,843
That's real good, boy. That's real good.

689
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,592
182 for Platt.

690
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:31,097
How much can even an average nigger pick a day?

691
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:32,515
200 pounds.

692
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:34,558
This nigger ain't even average.

693
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,649
512 pounds for Patsey.

694
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:41,486
512!

695
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:46,404
You menfolk got no shame letting Patsey out-pick you.

696
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:51,538
The day ain't yet come she swung lower than 500 pounds.

697
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,339
Queen of the fields, she is.

698
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,544
138 pounds...

699
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:00,459
I ain't done, Treach.

700
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:04,763
Ain't I owed a minute to luxuriate on the work Patsey done?

701
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:06,469
Yes, sir.

702
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,187
Damn queen.

703
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,684
Born and bred to the field.

704
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:20,604
A nigger among niggers.

705
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,691
And God gave her to me.

706
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,786
A lesson in the rewards of righteous living.

707
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:35,961
All be observant to that.

708
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:39,047
All!

709
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,376
Now, Treach. Now speak.

710
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:46,089
138 pounds for Phebe.

711
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:49,892
Hit 145 yesterday. Pull her out.

712
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,719
206 pounds for George.

713
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,059
How much he pick yesterday?

714
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:57,566
229.

715
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:58,896
Get him out.

716
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:00,481
Come on, get.

717
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:03,818
Come on.

718
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:05,779
Come on, boy, move!

719
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,016
Get up!

720
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:56,643
We dance tonight! Get up!

721
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:58,304
Get your fiddle, Platt. Get up!

722
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,518
Come on! Get, get, get!

723
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,523
Come on, Platt. Come on!

724
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:17,323
Come on, where's your merriment? Move your feet!

725
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,420
Sell her.

726
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:33,588
What's all this?

727
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:36,258
You will sell the negress.

728
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:38,222
Sell little Pats?

729
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:41,104
She pick with more vigor than any other nigger.

730
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:42,405
Choose another to go.

731
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,057
No other.

732
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:45,567
Sell her.

733
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:47,311
I will not.

734
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:51,532
You will remove that black bitch from this property...

735
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,614
or I'll take myself back to Cheneyville.

736
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,661
Back to that hog's trough where I found you?

737
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:07,498
Do not set yourself up against Patsey, my dear.

738
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:13,257
Because I will rid myself of you

739
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,263
well before I do away with her.

740
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,727
What you looking at?

741
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:27,689
Damn woman.

742
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:30,570
I won't have my mood spoiled.

743
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:32,822
I will not.

744
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:35,031
Dance.

745
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:36,902
Dance, I says!

746
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:42,950
Come on!

747
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:46,511
Pick it up, Platt. Play that fiddle, boy.

748
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,115
Platt.

749
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,460
Yes, Mistress?

750
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:32,045
Can you find your way to Bartholomew's?

751
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:33,918
I can, ma'am.

752
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:36,086
This is a list of goods and sundries.

753
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:39,177
You will take it to be filled and return immediately.

754
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:41,558
Take your tag.

755
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:43,514
Tell Bartholomew to add it to our debt.

756
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:44,678
Yes, Mistress.

757
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,940
Where you from, Platt?

758
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,311
I told you.

759
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:54,229
Tell me again.

760
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:55,772
Washington.

761
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:56,906
Who were your master?

762
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,990
Master name a Freeman.

763
01:02:58,149 --> 01:02:59,901
Was he a learned man?

764
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:02,328
I suppose so.

765
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:03,909
He learn you to read?

766
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,993
A word, here or there.

767
01:03:08,335 --> 01:03:10,095
But I have no understanding of the written...

768
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,339
Don't trouble yourself with it.

769
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:16,293
Same as the rest. Master brought you here to work, that's all.

770
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,134
Any more will earn you 100 lashes.

771
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:27,113
Come here, boy.

772
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,459
Come on.

773
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:49,307
Where you going, boy?

774
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:51,972
On my way to Bartholomew's.

775
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,391
Sent by Mistress Epps.

776
01:04:58,186 --> 01:05:00,154
You best get there, then.

777
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:02,824
Get there quick.

778
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:53,208
Any trouble?

779
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,869
No, ma'am. No trouble.

780
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:56,312
Platt Epps, good Sunday morning.

781
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:57,768
Good morning, Master Shaw.

782
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:00,400
Master sent me to retrieve Patsey. May I approach?

783
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:01,775
You may.

784
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:13,864
Excuse me, Mistress Shaw.

785
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,623
Nigger Platt.

786
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:17,580
Patsey, Master wishes you to return.

787
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,369
The Sabbath day, I is free to roam.

788
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:22,539
Master sent me running to fetch you, said no time should be wasted.

789
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:24,416
Drink of tea?

790
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:26,459
Thank you, Mistress, but I don't dare.

791
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:28,628
Would you know of Master Epps's consternation

792
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:31,969
to be any lessened with your timely return?

793
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:34,930
Anger's his constant condition.

794
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:35,889
Sit.

795
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:38,642
Sit and drink the tea that I offered.

796
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:45,954
What'n be Epps's concern?

797
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:49,490
I'd rather not say.

798
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:54,321
Oh, little gossip on the Sabbath be fine. All things in moderation.

799
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,120
As you are aware...

800
01:07:58,283 --> 01:08:04,165
Master Epps is a man of hard countenance.

801
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:06,670
You know he has ill feeling towards your husband.

802
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:08,085
He do.

803
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:11,096
Master Epps has somehow come to believe...

804
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:15,259
that Master Shaw is something of a lothario.

805
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:19,312
A misguided belief, no doubt.

806
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:20,642
No doubt...

807
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,933
if not born out of truth itself.

808
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:26,777
I meant no disrespect.

809
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:28,984
He ain't heard you.

810
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,666
I meant no disrespect to you, Mistress.

811
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:38,164
Got no cause to worry for my sensibilities.

812
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:43,503
I ain't felt the end of a lash in more years I can recall.

813
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,755
I ain't worked a field, neither.

814
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:48,170
Where once I served...

815
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:51,257
now, I have others serving me.

816
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:54,472
The cost to my current existence...

817
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:57,760
be Master Shaw broadcasting his affections...

818
01:08:57,925 --> 01:09:00,769
and me enjoying the pantomime of his fidelity.

819
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:06,564
If that what keep me from cotton picking niggers, that what it be.

820
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:10,447
A small and reasonable price to be paid, for sure.

821
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:17,450
I know what it like to be the object

822
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:20,164
of Master's predilections and peculiarities.

823
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,952
A lusty visit in the night...

824
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:26,587
or a visitation with the whip.

825
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:29,502
Take comfort, Patsey.

826
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:31,877
The good Lord will manage Epps.

827
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:36,886
In his own time, the good Lord will manage them all.

828
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:40,427
The curse of the pharaohs were a poor example...

829
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:43,517
of what wait for the plantation class.

830
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:50,608
This is nice.

831
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:04,497
Pats. Patsey!

832
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:06,332
Do not look in his direction. Continue on.

833
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,705
- Patsey! 
- Found her, Master.

834
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,503
And brought her back, just as instructed.

835
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:16,213
What did you just now tell her?

836
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:18,052
What did you say to Pats?

837
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,967
No words were spoken, none of consequence.

838
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,353
You're a liar.

839
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:26,647
You damn liar.

840
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,688
I saw you talking with her.

841
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,190
Tell me.

842
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:35,531
I cannot speak of what did not occur.

843
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:37,567
I'll cut your black throat!

844
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:38,860
Master!

845
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:40,824
You come here.

846
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,355
- Master Epps. 
- I said come here!

847
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:43,888
I brought her back, just like you...

848
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:46,709
- Come here! 
- Master!

849
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:49,912
Master.

850
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,835
I got her, just as instructed.

851
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,211
Master Epps!

852
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,005
You stay away from Pats, boy.

853
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:06,562
Master Epps.

854
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:35,249
It's the Lord's day.

855
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:39,588
Ain't nothing Christian in us carrying on like this.

856
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,020
I concede to you.

857
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:52,020
In the name of valor...

858
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:54,901
help your master to his feet.

859
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:00,691
I'm gonna kill you!

860
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:02,694
What's the fuss?

861
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,533
Master Epps believed Patsey and me

862
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:06,327
to be in conversation when we were not.

863
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:07,741
I tried to explain, but it's led to all this.

864
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:08,749
What is it?

865
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:12,044
You can't remain the Sabbath without her under your eye?

866
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:14,013
You are a no-account bastard.

867
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:16,040
A filthy, godless heathen.

868
01:12:16,207 --> 01:12:18,835
My bed is too holy for you to share.

869
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,093
What's he been telling you?

870
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:21,596
Of your misbegotten ways.

871
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:23,756
And he would know what of anything?

872
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:26,759
I ain't even spoken with him today.

873
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:29,429
You lying nigger, Platt.

874
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:31,188
Have I?

875
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:34,775
Have I?

876
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,776
There. There's all the truth he got.

877
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:42,025
Damn nigger.

878
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:35,138
Patsey.

879
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:34,344
A moment from the dancing.

880
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:37,761
Come sample what I baked for y'all.

881
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:40,738
Thank you, Mistress.

882
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:41,864
Thank you, Mistress.

883
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:44,017
There will be none for you, Patsey.

884
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:47,020
You see that?

885
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:50,193
You see that look of insolence she give me?

886
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:52,525
I seen nothing but her turn away.

887
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:54,910
Are you blind or ignorant?

888
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:57,367
It was hot, hateful scorn.

889
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:59,624
It filled that black face.

890
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:01,509
You tell me you didn't see it...

891
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:05,539
it's because you choose not to look, or are you saying I lie?

892
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:08,048
Whatever it was, it passed.

893
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:11,460
Is that how you are with the niggers?

894
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:15,218
Letting every ill thought fester inside them?

895
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:17,387
Look at them.

896
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:19,723
They foul with it.

897
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:21,979
They foul with their hate.

898
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:26,726
You let it be, it's gonna come back to us in the dark of night.

899
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,439
You want that?

900
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:31,864
You want them black animals leave us

901
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:34,655
gut like pigs in our own sleep?

902
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:36,193
Oh...

903
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:40,073
You are manless.

904
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,913
A damn eunuch if there ever was.

905
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,335
If you won't stand for me, I pray you'd

906
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:47,250
at least be a credit to your own kind

907
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:49,632
and beat every foul thought from them.

908
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:01,093
Beat it from them!

909
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:19,119
Eat.

910
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:21,989
Fill yourselves.

911
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:24,033
And then we dance.

912
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,708
I said, eat.

913
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:47,973
Platt.

914
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:51,064
Platt, you awake?

915
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:55,902
I am.

916
01:18:57,066 --> 01:18:59,239
I have a request.

917
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,908
An act of kindness.

918
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:07,876
I secreted it from the mistress.

919
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:10,329
Return it.

920
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:12,169
It yours, Platt.

921
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:15,172
For what cause?

922
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:19,510
All I ask, end my life.

923
01:19:20,714 --> 01:19:23,934
Take my body to the margin of the swamp.

924
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:27,097
Take me by the throat, hold me low in the water...

925
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:29,937
until I is still and without life.

926
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:32,268
Bury me in a lonely place of dying.

927
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:34,232
I will do no such thing.

928
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:37,189
The gory detail with which you speak...

929
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:39,859
I thought on it long and hard.

930
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:43,203
It is melancholia.

931
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,281
Nothing more.

932
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:49,247
How can you fall into such despair?

933
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:52,459
How can you not know?

934
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:58,552
I ain't got no comfort in this life.

935
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:04,884
If I can't buy mercy from you...

936
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:07,144
I'll beg it.

937
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:08,896
There are others.

938
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,398
- Beg them. 
- I'm begging you.

939
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:12,729
Why?

940
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:17,238
Why would you consign me to damnation with such an ungodly request?

941
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:19,398
There is God here!

942
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:23,657
God is merciful...

943
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:26,447
and he forgive merciful acts.

944
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:29,325
Won't be no hell for you.

945
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:32,662
Do it.

946
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:40,799
Do what I ain't got the strength to do myself.

947
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:21,961
It's a plague.

948
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:24,008
It's cotton worm.

949
01:21:24,171 --> 01:21:26,970
It's a plague. It's damn biblical.

950
01:21:28,175 --> 01:21:31,019
Two seasons God done sent a plague to smite me.

951
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:36,976
What I done that God hates me so?

952
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:45,321
It's that godless lot.

953
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:49,037
They brought this on me.

954
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:51,494
I bring them God's word and heathens

955
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:53,868
they are, they brung me God's scorn.

956
01:21:57,538 --> 01:21:58,539
Damn!

957
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:00,416
Damn you!

958
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:03,211
Damn all y'all!

959
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:31,989
Judge.

960
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:33,828
Mister Epps.

961
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:39,417
I am deeply saddened to hear about your misfortune.

962
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:42,091
Your price don't reflect your concern.

963
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:45,169
Listen up.

964
01:22:45,836 --> 01:22:47,713
You're Judge Turner's for the season.

965
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:49,681
More, if need be, until my crops return.

966
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:52,760
Y'all bring no disrespect to me.

967
01:22:52,926 --> 01:22:55,850
Don't bring no biblical plagues to him, you hear?

968
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:58,107
Or I'll take it out on your skin.

969
01:22:59,099 --> 01:23:00,521
Get out.

970
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:54,421
Get off the porch. You ain't supposed to be on the porch.

971
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:55,743
Get off the porch.

972
01:24:02,454 --> 01:24:03,797
Platt, is it?

973
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:05,290
Yes, sir.

974
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:08,461
You cultivate cane previously?

975
01:24:08,961 --> 01:24:10,133
No, sir, I have not.

976
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:12,468
It comes to you quite naturally.

977
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:13,632
Are you educated?

978
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:17,678
No, sir. Niggers are hired to work, not read or write.

979
01:24:19,513 --> 01:24:21,140
You play the fiddle.

980
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,438
Yes, sir. Yes, I do.

981
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,983
Willard Yarner, a planter up the bayou...

982
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:30,445
celebrates his anniversary in three weeks' time.

983
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:32,860
I'll hold out your name to him.

984
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:35,620
What you earn is yours to keep.

985
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,372
Yes, sir.

986
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:39,287
Mind yourself, Platt.

987
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:08,500


988
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:57,250
Whoa!

989
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:05,187
Joyous day.

990
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:07,973
Joyous day.

991
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,893
Dark times is behind us.

992
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:14,484
Clean living and prayer done lifted the plague!

993
01:27:16,356 --> 01:27:19,735
As thick and white as New England snow.

994
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:24,073
Now, my niggers is returned to me.

995
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:31,084
Heard Judge Turner gave you favor.

996
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:39,509
Did you beguile him, Platt, with your slick nigger ways?

997
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:44,935
You won't stand idle, boy.

998
01:27:45,385 --> 01:27:47,353
Not on my land.

999
01:27:50,182 --> 01:27:51,900
Much work to do!

1000
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:57,023
Days of old long since, huh?

1001
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:05,447
Joyous.

1002
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:08,914
Joyous, indeed! Whoo!

1003
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:12,971
Let's go find something sweet for you. Hmm?

1004
01:28:12,996 --> 01:28:14,168
Mmm-hmm.

1005
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:16,628
Candy.

1006
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:18,009
Candy?

1007
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:21,422
# Oh, pick this cotton #

1008
01:28:21,588 --> 01:28:22,606
# Pick this cotton #

1009
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:24,929
# Oh, pick this cotton #

1010
01:28:25,091 --> 01:28:27,219
# Oh, pick that cotton #

1011
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:29,137
# Man ain't mean, boys #

1012
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:30,851
# Man ain't mean, boys #

1013
01:28:31,014 --> 01:28:33,016
# Man ain't mean, boys #

1014
01:28:33,183 --> 01:28:34,275
# Man ain't mean #

1015
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:36,903
# Oh, work this cotton #

1016
01:28:37,062 --> 01:28:38,063
# Work this cotton #

1017
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:40,983
# Oh, work this cotton #

1018
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:42,275
# Work this cotton #

1019
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:45,036
# Oh, work ain't hard, boys #

1020
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:46,530
George.

1021
01:28:46,696 --> 01:28:48,448
180 pounds.

1022
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:50,208
Patsey.

1023
01:28:50,367 --> 01:28:52,790
520 pounds for Patsey.

1024
01:28:52,953 --> 01:28:55,752
That's my girl. Don't ever let me down.

1025
01:28:56,081 --> 01:28:57,298
Platt?

1026
01:28:57,457 --> 01:28:59,710
160 pounds.

1027
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:03,054
Armsby?

1028
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:05,511
64 pounds.

1029
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:12,313
A good day's labor would average 200 pounds.

1030
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:13,849
Yes, sir.

1031
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:21,239
I'm sure in time, you'll develop as a picker.

1032
01:29:21,648 --> 01:29:23,650
But it takes effort, boy.

1033
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:27,321
Put some damn effort into it.

1034
01:29:27,487 --> 01:29:28,158
Yes, sir.

1035
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:30,415
Take them out, get to whipping.

1036
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:38,961
It's a tragedy.

1037
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:41,835
How does such come to pass?

1038
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:46,056
Working a field and picking cotton like a lowly hand.

1039
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:48,968
I'm of a damn sight better station.

1040
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:52,104
I worked as an overseer, you know.

1041
01:29:52,262 --> 01:29:53,684
I did not know, sir.

1042
01:29:53,847 --> 01:29:55,349
Not "sir."

1043
01:29:56,016 --> 01:29:57,859
Just "Armsby."

1044
01:29:58,727 --> 01:30:00,900
I'm not owed more than any other in the field.

1045
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:04,032
How did you arrive at such a place, if I may ask?

1046
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:07,035
Ask, it's just conversation.

1047
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:12,124
I became a little too dependent on the whiskey...

1048
01:30:12,282 --> 01:30:14,751
a little too undependable on the job.

1049
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:18,793
Now, before you say I'm just a sorry drunkard...

1050
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:21,083
let me state my case.

1051
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,128
As reliable employment as overseeing is,

1052
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,346
it is no easy chore on the spirit.

1053
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:30,016
I say, no man of conscious...

1054
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:32,644
can take the lash to another human day in and day out...

1055
01:30:32,802 --> 01:30:35,180
without shredding at his own self.

1056
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:38,354
Takes him to a place...

1057
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:43,022
where he either makes excuses within his mind to be unaffected...

1058
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:46,866
or he finds some way to trample his guilty sensations.

1059
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:49,369
So, I trampled.

1060
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:51,450
With frequency.

1061
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:56,118
I gave in to tales of wealth and prosperity.

1062
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:03,877
But such profitable outcomes are reserved for plantation masters.

1063
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:07,675
It's the lot of the rest of us to serve.

1064
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:14,679
Now, all I want is to earn a decent wage and get myself home.

1065
01:31:46,876 --> 01:31:48,970
The proceeds of my fiddling performances.

1066
01:31:49,796 --> 01:31:53,926
Just a few picayunes, but all I have in the world.

1067
01:31:54,551 --> 01:31:57,930
I promise them to you if you will do me the favor I require.

1068
01:31:58,096 --> 01:32:02,146
But I beg you not to expose me if you cannot grant the request.

1069
01:32:02,684 --> 01:32:03,776
Uh...

1070
01:32:04,477 --> 01:32:06,104
What is it you ask?

1071
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:08,444
First, your word, sir.

1072
01:32:09,149 --> 01:32:10,150
On my honor.

1073
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:14,279
It's a simple enough request.

1074
01:32:15,655 --> 01:32:17,453
I only ask that you deposit a letter

1075
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:19,326
at the post office in Marksville...

1076
01:32:19,492 --> 01:32:22,962
and that you keep the action an inviolable secret forever.

1077
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:28,635
A patron is what I require, sir.

1078
01:32:35,175 --> 01:32:36,017
I'll do it.

1079
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:39,558
And I'll accept whatever payment's offered.

1080
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:44,856
To assist you, I put my own self at risk.

1081
01:32:45,643 --> 01:32:47,486
I will do so...

1082
01:32:47,645 --> 01:32:50,819
but fair compensation is all I ask.

1083
01:33:00,325 --> 01:33:02,248
Draw up your letter.

1084
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,879
We'll meet again in two days?

1085
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:08,379
In two days.

1086
01:33:11,169 --> 01:33:12,671
Thank you.

1087
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:32,088
Well, boy...

1088
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:37,097
I understand I got a learned nigger that writes letters.

1089
01:34:38,173 --> 01:34:41,268
Tries to get white fellas to mail them.

1090
01:34:47,599 --> 01:34:50,273
Armsby told me today...

1091
01:34:50,435 --> 01:34:52,938
the devil was among my niggers.

1092
01:34:54,606 --> 01:34:57,576
That I had one that needed watching...

1093
01:34:57,734 --> 01:35:00,078
or he would run away.

1094
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:03,907
When I asked him why...

1095
01:35:04,782 --> 01:35:08,286
he said you come over to him...

1096
01:35:08,453 --> 01:35:11,297
waked him up in the middle of the night...

1097
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:14,130
and wanted him to carry a letter...

1098
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:17,128
to Marksville.

1099
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:24,640
What do you got to say to that?

1100
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:29,228
There's no truth to it.

1101
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:31,643
You say.

1102
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:36,110
How could I write a letter without ink or paper?

1103
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:40,777
Who am I gonna write to? I got no friends living as I know of.

1104
01:35:41,903 --> 01:35:43,576
That Armsby...

1105
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:48,493
That Armsby is a lying, drunken fellow.

1106
01:35:50,328 --> 01:35:53,252
Didn't he want you to hire him as an overseer?

1107
01:35:55,124 --> 01:35:56,751
Well, that's it.

1108
01:35:58,127 --> 01:36:00,328
He wants to make you believe we're all gonna run away...

1109
01:36:00,338 --> 01:36:02,841
so you'll hire him as an overseer.

1110
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:06,728
He believes you're a soft soap.

1111
01:36:07,595 --> 01:36:10,064
And he's given to such talk.

1112
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:14,690
Made this story out of whole cloth...

1113
01:36:15,228 --> 01:36:17,572
because he wants a situation.

1114
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:25,409
It's all a lie, Master.

1115
01:36:30,868 --> 01:36:32,870
It's all a lie.

1116
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:43,047
I'll be damned.

1117
01:36:49,095 --> 01:36:51,848
Were he not free and white, Platt.

1118
01:36:53,891 --> 01:36:56,269
Were he not free and white.

1119
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:16,274
# Sun gonna set here #

1120
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:18,184
# Under the mountain #

1121
01:38:18,351 --> 01:38:20,399
# Sun gonna set here #

1122
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:22,279
# Under the mountain #

1123
01:38:22,438 --> 01:38:24,315
# Sun gonna set here #

1124
01:38:24,482 --> 01:38:26,450
# Under the mountain #

1125
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:29,078
Edward!

1126
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:30,864
Get him water.

1127
01:38:38,204 --> 01:38:39,672
Get up!

1128
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:41,833
Get up!

1129
01:38:48,506 --> 01:38:49,883
Nigger, get up!

1130
01:38:56,013 --> 01:38:58,266
What you looking at, boy?

1131
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:01,687
Keep picking, boy!

1132
01:39:14,615 --> 01:39:18,210
I just wanna say something about Uncle Abram.

1133
01:39:22,457 --> 01:39:24,551
He was a good man...

1134
01:39:24,876 --> 01:39:28,130
and he always looked out for us ever since we were little.

1135
01:39:28,921 --> 01:39:30,548
God love him.

1136
01:39:31,215 --> 01:39:33,809
God bless him. God keep him.

1137
01:39:34,886 --> 01:39:36,263
Amen.

1138
01:39:51,569 --> 01:39:54,948
# Went down to the River Jordan #

1139
01:39:55,114 --> 01:39:58,288
# Where John baptized three #

1140
01:39:58,451 --> 01:40:01,455
# When I woke the devil in hell #

1141
01:40:01,621 --> 01:40:04,420
# Said Johnny baptized me #

1142
01:40:04,582 --> 01:40:08,086
# I said roll, Jordan, roll #

1143
01:40:08,586 --> 01:40:11,089
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1144
01:40:11,255 --> 01:40:14,259
# My soul will rise in heaven, Lord #

1145
01:40:14,425 --> 01:40:16,974
# For the year when Jordan roll #

1146
01:40:17,136 --> 01:40:20,515
# Well, some say John was a Baptist #

1147
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:23,275
# Some say John was a Jew #

1148
01:40:23,434 --> 01:40:25,812
# But I say John was a preacher #

1149
01:40:25,978 --> 01:40:28,948
# 'Cause my Bible says so too #

1150
01:40:29,106 --> 01:40:32,610
# I said roll, Jordan, roll #

1151
01:40:32,777 --> 01:40:35,280
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1152
01:40:35,446 --> 01:40:38,450
# My soul will rise in heaven, Lord #

1153
01:40:38,616 --> 01:40:40,368
# For the year when Jordan roll #

1154
01:40:40,535 --> 01:40:41,957
# Hallelujah #

1155
01:40:42,119 --> 01:40:47,626
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1156
01:40:47,792 --> 01:40:50,841
# My soul will rise in heaven, Lord #

1157
01:40:51,003 --> 01:40:52,846
# For the year when Jordan roll #

1158
01:40:53,005 --> 01:40:54,222
# Hallelujah #

1159
01:40:54,382 --> 01:41:00,139
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1160
01:41:00,304 --> 01:41:03,353
# My soul will rise in heaven, Lord #

1161
01:41:03,516 --> 01:41:05,518
# For the year when Jordan roll #

1162
01:41:05,685 --> 01:41:07,028
# Everybody say #

1163
01:41:07,186 --> 01:41:12,659
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1164
01:41:12,817 --> 01:41:15,821
# My soul will rise in heaven, Lord #

1165
01:41:15,987 --> 01:41:17,864
# For the year when Jordan roll #

1166
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:19,156
# Oh, children #

1167
01:41:19,323 --> 01:41:24,750
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1168
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:27,836
# My soul will rise in heaven, Lord #

1169
01:41:27,999 --> 01:41:29,751
# For the year when Jordan roll #

1170
01:41:29,917 --> 01:41:31,260
# Hallelujah #

1171
01:41:31,419 --> 01:41:36,846
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1172
01:41:37,008 --> 01:41:39,887
# My soul will rise in heaven, Lord #

1173
01:41:40,052 --> 01:41:42,521
# For the year when Jordan roll #

1174
01:42:02,366 --> 01:42:04,118
Right to the end.

1175
01:42:12,627 --> 01:42:14,174
Hey, Bass.

1176
01:42:15,087 --> 01:42:16,555
Oh, no, no, no.

1177
01:42:16,714 --> 01:42:19,183
No shame in taking respite from the heat.

1178
01:42:19,342 --> 01:42:21,060
Drink, shade.

1179
01:42:21,218 --> 01:42:23,863
It's ungodly for travelers, hearty or otherwise.

1180
01:42:28,893 --> 01:42:29,985
What's funny?

1181
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:33,865
Epps, I merely mean to finish the work at hand, as requested.

1182
01:42:34,023 --> 01:42:35,821
And as paid for.

1183
01:42:35,983 --> 01:42:37,781
If something rubs you wrongly...

1184
01:42:37,943 --> 01:42:40,867
I offer you the opportunity to speak on it.

1185
01:42:44,116 --> 01:42:46,744
You ask plainly, so I will tell you plainly.

1186
01:42:47,536 --> 01:42:51,757
What amused me just then was your concern for my well-being in this heat...

1187
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:54,969
when, quite frankly, the condition of your laborers...

1188
01:42:55,127 --> 01:42:56,395
"The condition of my laborers"?

1189
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:58,422
It is horrid. It's all wrong.

1190
01:42:58,589 --> 01:42:59,841
All wrong, Mr. Epps.

1191
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:02,260
They ain't hired help.

1192
01:43:02,426 --> 01:43:03,473
They're my property.

1193
01:43:04,303 --> 01:43:05,304
You say that with pride.

1194
01:43:05,471 --> 01:43:07,144
I say it as fact.

1195
01:43:09,225 --> 01:43:11,899
If this conversation concerns what is factual

1196
01:43:12,019 --> 01:43:14,693
and what is not, then it must be said...

1197
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:17,984
that there is no justice nor righteousness in their slavery.

1198
01:43:18,818 --> 01:43:20,946
But you do open up an interesting question.

1199
01:43:22,113 --> 01:43:23,535
What right have you to your niggers,

1200
01:43:23,656 --> 01:43:25,033
when you come down to the point?

1201
01:43:25,449 --> 01:43:26,746
- What right? 
- Mmm.

1202
01:43:27,368 --> 01:43:30,212
I bought them. I paid for them.

1203
01:43:30,579 --> 01:43:32,331
Of course you did, and the law says

1204
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:34,254
you have the right to hold a nigger.

1205
01:43:34,417 --> 01:43:36,385
But begging the law's pardon, it lies.

1206
01:43:37,002 --> 01:43:39,050
Suppose they pass a law taking away

1207
01:43:39,171 --> 01:43:41,219
your liberty, making you a slave.

1208
01:43:41,382 --> 01:43:42,508
Suppose.

1209
01:43:42,675 --> 01:43:44,302
That ain't a supposable case.

1210
01:43:44,468 --> 01:43:45,890
Laws change, Epps.

1211
01:43:46,053 --> 01:43:48,147
Universal truths are constant.

1212
01:43:48,305 --> 01:43:51,149
It is a fact, a plain and simple fact...

1213
01:43:51,308 --> 01:43:54,528
that what is true and right is true and right for all.

1214
01:43:54,687 --> 01:43:56,689
White and black alike.

1215
01:43:58,315 --> 01:44:00,158
You comparing me to a nigger, Bass?

1216
01:44:00,317 --> 01:44:03,161
I'm only asking, in the eyes of God, what is the difference?

1217
01:44:05,156 --> 01:44:06,924
You might as well ask what the difference is

1218
01:44:06,949 --> 01:44:09,327
between a white man and a baboon.

1219
01:44:10,536 --> 01:44:13,335
I seen one of them critters in Orleans.

1220
01:44:13,497 --> 01:44:15,875
Know just as much as any nigger I got.

1221
01:44:16,167 --> 01:44:17,840
Listen, Epps.

1222
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:19,675
These niggers are human beings.

1223
01:44:19,837 --> 01:44:22,197
If they are allowed to climb no higher than brute animals...

1224
01:44:22,339 --> 01:44:25,013
you and men like you will have to answer for it.

1225
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:28,183
There is an ill, Mr. Epps...

1226
01:44:28,345 --> 01:44:30,723
a fearful ill resting upon this nation.

1227
01:44:31,348 --> 01:44:34,352
And there will be a day of reckoning yet.

1228
01:44:36,937 --> 01:44:39,611
You like to hear yourself talk, Bass...

1229
01:44:39,774 --> 01:44:41,868
better than any man I know of.

1230
01:44:42,943 --> 01:44:46,618
You'd argue that black was white, or white, black...

1231
01:44:46,781 --> 01:44:49,034
if anybody would contradict you.

1232
01:44:51,035 --> 01:44:54,414
A fine supposition if you lived among Yankees in New England.

1233
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:56,253
But you don't.

1234
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:01,883
You most assuredly do not.

1235
01:45:27,404 --> 01:45:29,782
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!

1236
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:33,581
Patsey!

1237
01:45:35,579 --> 01:45:36,956
Pats!

1238
01:45:37,665 --> 01:45:39,087
Where is she?

1239
01:45:39,834 --> 01:45:41,256
Where's Pats?

1240
01:45:41,418 --> 01:45:43,762
Where is she, damn it? Where is she?

1241
01:45:45,714 --> 01:45:48,593
Phebs, where is she? Where is Patsey? Where is she?

1242
01:45:48,759 --> 01:45:50,056
What you standing there for?

1243
01:45:50,219 --> 01:45:51,459
We know nothing of her, Master.

1244
01:45:51,470 --> 01:45:52,892
- Know nothing of what? 
- We know nothing of...

1245
01:45:53,055 --> 01:45:55,433
Of what? Where has she gone?

1246
01:45:55,599 --> 01:45:56,600
She run off, ain't she?

1247
01:45:56,767 --> 01:45:57,768
I don't know, Master.

1248
01:45:57,935 --> 01:45:59,482
- Where is she? 
- I don't know, Master.

1249
01:45:59,645 --> 01:46:02,615
You know, you know, you know!

1250
01:46:02,773 --> 01:46:03,615
You know!

1251
01:46:03,774 --> 01:46:05,447
No, I don't!

1252
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:09,659
You miserable black dogs.

1253
01:46:09,822 --> 01:46:12,291
You stand like the deaf and dumb.

1254
01:46:14,076 --> 01:46:15,453
Speak!

1255
01:46:30,634 --> 01:46:32,307
She gone.

1256
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:36,648
My Pats is gone.

1257
01:46:53,532 --> 01:46:55,500
Run off? Run off, did you?

1258
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:57,659
- Master Epps... 
- You miserable wench. Where you been?

1259
01:46:57,786 --> 01:46:59,163
I been nowhere!

1260
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:00,422
Lies to your misdeeds!

1261
01:47:00,581 --> 01:47:01,932
The Sabbath day, Master. I took me

1262
01:47:01,957 --> 01:47:03,309
a walk to commune with the Lord.

1263
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:04,768
Bring the Lord into your deceptions?

1264
01:47:04,793 --> 01:47:06,270
You're coming from Shaw's plantation.

1265
01:47:06,295 --> 01:47:07,592
- No! 
- Master Epps.

1266
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:09,131
Now, you speak?

1267
01:47:09,298 --> 01:47:11,346
Now that you want to add to her lies, you find your tongue!

1268
01:47:11,508 --> 01:47:13,819
I went to Master Shaw's plantation.

1269
01:47:13,844 --> 01:47:15,346
Ah! You admit it.

1270
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:16,976
Yes, freely.

1271
01:47:17,139 --> 01:47:18,982
And you know why?

1272
01:47:19,141 --> 01:47:21,690
I got this from Mistress Shaw.

1273
01:47:22,186 --> 01:47:26,191
Mistress Epps won't even grant me no soap to clean with.

1274
01:47:26,774 --> 01:47:30,369
I stink so much, I make myself gag!

1275
01:47:33,614 --> 01:47:36,868
500 pounds of cotton.

1276
01:47:37,034 --> 01:47:39,036
Day in, day out!

1277
01:47:39,203 --> 01:47:41,046
More than any man here.

1278
01:47:41,205 --> 01:47:43,299
And for that, I will be clean.

1279
01:47:43,457 --> 01:47:45,175
That's all I ask.

1280
01:47:45,334 --> 01:47:48,383
This, here, what I went to Shaw's for.

1281
01:47:49,838 --> 01:47:50,885
Liar.

1282
01:47:51,048 --> 01:47:54,643
The Lord knows that's all!

1283
01:47:54,802 --> 01:47:55,724
You're a liar.

1284
01:47:55,886 --> 01:47:59,311
And you, blind with your own covetousness!

1285
01:48:00,182 --> 01:48:02,310
I don't lie, Master.

1286
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:06,064
If you kill me, I'll stick to that.

1287
01:48:06,814 --> 01:48:08,407
I'll fetch you down.

1288
01:48:09,233 --> 01:48:11,281
I'll learn you to go to Shaw's.

1289
01:48:11,735 --> 01:48:12,827
Treach.

1290
01:48:14,863 --> 01:48:16,365
Run and fetch some line.

1291
01:48:16,532 --> 01:48:17,704
Edward!

1292
01:48:19,326 --> 01:48:22,330
Strip her. Strike her bare and lash her to the post.

1293
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:42,908
You done this to yourself, Pats.

1294
01:48:54,611 --> 01:48:55,783
Do it.

1295
01:49:00,868 --> 01:49:03,087
Strike the life from her.

1296
01:49:09,293 --> 01:49:10,715
Beat her.

1297
01:49:12,337 --> 01:49:14,590
Give her the whip! Give it all to her!

1298
01:49:15,883 --> 01:49:18,853
Platt, you come here and you beat her now.

1299
01:49:21,305 --> 01:49:22,397
Platt!

1300
01:49:25,184 --> 01:49:26,436
Come here!

1301
01:49:28,187 --> 01:49:30,360
I'd rather it you, Platt!

1302
01:49:31,315 --> 01:49:33,067
You strike her.

1303
01:49:33,942 --> 01:49:35,364
Strike her.

1304
01:49:57,674 --> 01:49:59,267
He pantomimes.

1305
01:49:59,885 --> 01:50:02,308
There's barely a welt on her.

1306
01:50:02,763 --> 01:50:05,141
That's what your niggers make of you...

1307
01:50:05,307 --> 01:50:07,480
a fool for the taking.

1308
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:14,403
Strike her, Platt. Strike her!

1309
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:32,547
You will strike her.

1310
01:50:32,709 --> 01:50:34,427
You will strike her until her flesh

1311
01:50:34,545 --> 01:50:36,263
is rent and meat and blood flow equal...

1312
01:50:36,421 --> 01:50:39,220
or I will kill every nigger in my sight.

1313
01:50:39,383 --> 01:50:40,885
You understand me?

1314
01:50:41,051 --> 01:50:43,895
Strike her! Strike her!

1315
01:51:27,139 --> 01:51:29,938
Until I say no more. I ain't said nothing!

1316
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:41,157
Give me the whip!

1317
01:51:42,154 --> 01:51:43,371
Get up!

1318
01:52:02,799 --> 01:52:04,472
Thou devil!

1319
01:52:07,012 --> 01:52:08,559
Sooner or later...

1320
01:52:09,223 --> 01:52:11,817
somewhere in the course of eternal

1321
01:52:11,975 --> 01:52:14,569
justice, thou shalt answer for this sin!

1322
01:52:19,983 --> 01:52:23,032
Sin? There is no sin.

1323
01:52:24,488 --> 01:52:27,412
Man does how he pleases with his property.

1324
01:52:33,038 --> 01:52:36,759
At the moment, Platt, I'm of great pleasure.

1325
01:52:36,917 --> 01:52:38,760
You be goddamn careful I don't want to

1326
01:52:38,877 --> 01:52:40,675
come and lighten my mood no further.

1327
01:54:58,975 --> 01:55:00,477
Master Bass.

1328
01:55:00,769 --> 01:55:03,943
I want to ask you what part of the country you come from.

1329
01:55:05,148 --> 01:55:07,025
No part of this land.

1330
01:55:08,110 --> 01:55:10,158
I originate from Canada.

1331
01:55:11,154 --> 01:55:12,701
Now, guess where that is.

1332
01:55:12,864 --> 01:55:14,787
I know where Canada is.

1333
01:55:15,617 --> 01:55:17,369
I've been there myself.

1334
01:55:22,290 --> 01:55:24,133
Montreal...

1335
01:55:24,292 --> 01:55:27,341
and Kingston and Queenston and a great many places.

1336
01:55:27,504 --> 01:55:29,347
Well-traveled for a slave.

1337
01:55:29,506 --> 01:55:30,553
How came you here?

1338
01:55:32,634 --> 01:55:34,307
Master Bass...

1339
01:55:36,638 --> 01:55:40,017
if justice had been done, I never would have been here.

1340
01:55:44,813 --> 01:55:46,156
How's this?

1341
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:48,237
Tell me all.

1342
01:55:53,697 --> 01:55:55,870
I'm afraid to tell you.

1343
01:55:57,534 --> 01:56:00,663
Every word you speak is a profound secret.

1344
01:56:08,211 --> 01:56:09,884
Your story...

1345
01:56:10,547 --> 01:56:12,015
it is amazing.

1346
01:56:12,174 --> 01:56:14,176
And in no good way.

1347
01:56:18,930 --> 01:56:22,560
Do you believe, sir, in justice, as you said?

1348
01:56:23,727 --> 01:56:25,274
I do.

1349
01:56:25,437 --> 01:56:29,237
That slavery is an evil that should befall none?

1350
01:56:32,068 --> 01:56:33,866
I believe so.

1351
01:56:34,029 --> 01:56:35,952
If you truly do...

1352
01:56:37,741 --> 01:56:40,790
then I ask, I beg...

1353
01:56:43,455 --> 01:56:46,254
that you write my friends in the north...

1354
01:56:46,625 --> 01:56:49,424
acquainting them of my situation...

1355
01:56:50,795 --> 01:56:55,096
and beseeching them to forward free papers.

1356
01:57:00,096 --> 01:57:01,769
It would be...

1357
01:57:04,768 --> 01:57:07,612
an unspeakable happiness...

1358
01:57:09,231 --> 01:57:11,279
to see my wife...

1359
01:57:13,777 --> 01:57:16,075
and my family again.

1360
01:57:21,952 --> 01:57:25,331
I traveled this country for the best part of 20 years...

1361
01:57:25,997 --> 01:57:28,921
and my freedom is everything.

1362
01:57:29,084 --> 01:57:33,430
The fact that I can walk out of here tomorrow brings me great pleasure.

1363
01:57:36,049 --> 01:57:38,302
My life doesn't mean much to anyone.

1364
01:57:39,636 --> 01:57:43,311
It seems yours might mean a lot to a whole lot of people.

1365
01:57:45,058 --> 01:57:49,529
But what you ask of me, sir, scares me.

1366
01:57:51,690 --> 01:57:54,534
And I must say, I am afraid.

1367
01:57:55,652 --> 01:57:57,996
Not just for you, but for me.

1368
01:58:07,163 --> 01:58:09,336
I will write your letter, sir.

1369
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:11,101
And if it brings you your freedom,

1370
01:58:11,126 --> 01:58:12,366
it will be more than a pleasure.

1371
01:58:12,377 --> 01:58:14,345
It will have been my duty.

1372
01:58:14,504 --> 01:58:17,508
Now, would you kindly hand me those shingles?

1373
02:00:52,078 --> 02:00:53,250
Platt!

1374
02:00:53,663 --> 02:00:55,711
Where's the boy called Platt?

1375
02:00:59,002 --> 02:01:00,379
Come here, boy.

1376
02:01:22,525 --> 02:01:24,277
Your name is Platt, is it?

1377
02:01:26,070 --> 02:01:27,367
Yes, sir.

1378
02:01:28,031 --> 02:01:29,578
You know that man?

1379
02:01:47,383 --> 02:01:48,976
Mr. Parker.

1380
02:01:49,636 --> 02:01:51,138
Say again?

1381
02:01:53,181 --> 02:01:55,024
Mr. Parker.

1382
02:01:55,475 --> 02:01:58,149
That man received a letter compiling many accusations.

1383
02:01:58,311 --> 02:02:00,154
You look me in the eye...

1384
02:02:00,814 --> 02:02:02,540
and on your life, you answer me truthfully.

1385
02:02:02,565 --> 02:02:04,238
Have you any other name than Platt?

1386
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:06,402
Solomon Northup is my name.

1387
02:02:06,569 --> 02:02:07,769
Sheriff, what's all this?

1388
02:02:07,904 --> 02:02:09,281
It's official business.

1389
02:02:09,447 --> 02:02:10,744
My nigger, my business.

1390
02:02:10,907 --> 02:02:12,534
Your business waits.

1391
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:13,792
Tell me of your family.

1392
02:02:14,118 --> 02:02:15,540
I have a wife, two children.

1393
02:02:15,703 --> 02:02:16,579
What the hell?

1394
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:18,515
- What are your children's names? 
- Margaret and Alonzo.

1395
02:02:18,540 --> 02:02:19,891
What was your wife's name before her marriage?

1396
02:02:19,916 --> 02:02:21,418
Anne Hampton. I am who I say.

1397
02:02:21,584 --> 02:02:22,585
Where you going, Platt?

1398
02:02:23,461 --> 02:02:25,381
Who authorized you to interfere with my property?

1399
02:02:25,505 --> 02:02:26,597
My authority.

1400
02:02:26,756 --> 02:02:28,099
Platt, you come back here. Platt!

1401
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:29,926
You come back here, boy.

1402
02:02:30,927 --> 02:02:32,099
Boy.

1403
02:02:34,556 --> 02:02:36,979
You unhand him. Platt is my nigger!

1404
02:02:37,141 --> 02:02:38,563
He is Mr. Solomon Northup.

1405
02:02:38,726 --> 02:02:39,602
You say.

1406
02:02:39,769 --> 02:02:42,238
You come here, unfamiliar to me, and make claims.

1407
02:02:42,397 --> 02:02:44,123
I got no doubts. The man is Solomon Northup.

1408
02:02:44,148 --> 02:02:46,492
The hell he is! He's my nigger, and I'll fight you for him!

1409
02:02:46,651 --> 02:02:47,948
As is your right.

1410
02:02:48,111 --> 02:02:50,312
As it will be my pleasure to bankrupt you in the courts.

1411
02:02:50,446 --> 02:02:52,790
Your decision. Unhand him.

1412
02:02:53,573 --> 02:02:55,134
I know you had some hand in this, Platt.

1413
02:02:55,159 --> 02:02:56,627
I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.

1414
02:02:56,786 --> 02:02:57,912
Pay him no mind.

1415
02:02:58,079 --> 02:02:59,456
I paid good money for this nigger.

1416
02:02:59,581 --> 02:03:00,958
Courthouse got papers to prove it!

1417
02:03:01,124 --> 02:03:02,922
And we got papers proving he's free!

1418
02:03:03,084 --> 02:03:04,802
I own you. You belong to me. You hear me, Platt?

1419
02:03:04,961 --> 02:03:06,087
Unhand him!

1420
02:03:06,254 --> 02:03:08,473
You'll have 200 stripes across your back by sundown!

1421
02:03:08,631 --> 02:03:09,757
Platt!

1422
02:03:09,966 --> 02:03:11,809
Get my horse, Treach.

1423
02:03:20,935 --> 02:03:22,152
Get away from him, Pats.

1424
02:03:23,479 --> 02:03:25,322
I'm gonna be seeing you real soon.

1425
02:03:25,481 --> 02:03:27,449
Solomon, we need to make haste.

1426
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:30,153
No.

1427
02:03:30,737 --> 02:03:32,080
Solomon.

1428
02:05:09,002 --> 02:05:11,175
I'll apologize...

1429
02:05:13,256 --> 02:05:15,258
for my appearance.

1430
02:05:17,844 --> 02:05:19,767
But I have had...

1431
02:05:20,722 --> 02:05:22,690
a difficult time...

1432
02:05:23,683 --> 02:05:26,402
these past several years.

1433
02:05:31,274 --> 02:05:32,617
Margaret.

1434
02:05:38,197 --> 02:05:39,915
Alonzo.

1435
02:06:11,064 --> 02:06:12,782
Who is this?

1436
02:06:13,816 --> 02:06:15,818
He's my husband.

1437
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:18,492
Husband.

1438
02:06:19,322 --> 02:06:22,667
It is very good to meet you, sir.

1439
02:06:24,452 --> 02:06:26,671
We have much acquainting to do.

1440
02:06:26,829 --> 02:06:28,172
Yes, sir.

1441
02:06:29,415 --> 02:06:33,465
And this is your grandson.

1442
02:06:34,295 --> 02:06:37,469
Solomon Northup Staunton.

1443
02:06:47,683 --> 02:06:49,276
Solomon.

1444
02:06:55,525 --> 02:06:56,822
Anne...

1445
02:06:59,195 --> 02:07:00,993
forgive me.

1446
02:07:04,534 --> 02:07:08,038
There is nothing to forgive.

1447
02:07:30,134 --> 02:07:36,438


1448
02:07:37,634 --> 02:07:42,338


1449
02:07:43,934 --> 02:07:51,538


1450
02:07:52,134 --> 02:08:00,938


1451
02:08:02,134 --> 02:08:07,638


1452
02:08:08,834 --> 02:08:19,838


1453
02:08:21,034 --> 02:08:27,238


1454
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:33,500


1455
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:44,000


1456
02:11:39,350 --> 02:11:42,775
# Went down to the River Jordan #

1457
02:11:42,937 --> 02:11:46,111
# Where John baptized three #

1458
02:11:46,273 --> 02:11:49,277
# When I woke the devil in hell #

1459
02:11:49,443 --> 02:11:52,242
# Said Johnny baptized me #

1460
02:11:52,405 --> 02:11:55,875
# I said roll, Jordan, roll #

1461
02:11:56,367 --> 02:11:58,916
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1462
02:11:59,078 --> 02:12:02,048
# My soul will rise in heaven, Lord #

1463
02:12:02,206 --> 02:12:04,800
# For the year when Jordan roll #

1464
02:12:04,959 --> 02:12:08,338
# Well, some say John was a Baptist #

1465
02:12:08,504 --> 02:12:11,098
# Some say John was a Jew #

1466
02:12:11,257 --> 02:12:13,635
# But I say John was a preacher #

1467
02:12:13,801 --> 02:12:16,771
# 'Cause my Bible says so too #

1468
02:12:16,929 --> 02:12:20,433
# I said roll, Jordan, roll #

1469
02:12:20,599 --> 02:12:23,102
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1470
02:12:23,269 --> 02:12:26,273
# My soul will rise in heaven, Lord #

1471
02:12:26,439 --> 02:12:28,191
# For the year when Jordan roll #

1472
02:12:28,357 --> 02:12:29,734
# Hallelujah #

1473
02:12:29,900 --> 02:12:35,407
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1474
02:12:35,573 --> 02:12:38,668
# My soul will rise in heaven, Lord #

1475
02:12:38,826 --> 02:12:40,669
# For the year when Jordan roll #

1476
02:12:40,828 --> 02:12:42,045
# Oh, roll now #

1477
02:12:42,204 --> 02:12:47,768
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1478
02:12:47,793 --> 02:12:50,888
# My soul will rise in heaven, Lord #

1479

02:12:54,300 --> 02:12:59,773

1483
02:13:03,058 --> 02:13:04,981
# For the year when Jordan roll #

1484
02:13:05,144 --> 02:13:06,270
# Everybody say #

1485
02:13:06,437 --> 02:13:09,236
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1486
02:13:09,648 --> 02:13:12,242
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1487
02:13:12,693 --> 02:13:15,617
# My soul will rise in heaven, Lord #

1488
02:13:15,779 --> 02:13:17,531
# For the year when Jordan roll #

1489
02:13:17,698 --> 02:13:19,041
# Oh, children #

1490
02:13:19,200 --> 02:13:24,627
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1491
02:13:24,788 --> 02:13:27,667
# My soul will rise in heaven, Lord #

1492
02:13:27,833 --> 02:13:29,852
# For the year when Jordan roll #

1493
02:13:29,877 --> 02:13:31,312
# Halleluiah #

1494
02:13:31,337 --> 02:13:33,590
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1495
02:13:34,256 --> 02:13:36,759
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1496
02:13:36,926 --> 02:13:39,987
# My soul will rise in heaven, Lord #

1497
02:13:40,012 --> 02:13:42,140
# For the year when Jordan roll #
