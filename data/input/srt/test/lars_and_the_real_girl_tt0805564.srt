1
00:02:05,154 --> 00:02:08,034
I'm inviting you to breakfast.

2
00:02:12,434 --> 00:02:14,746
I can't, I have to go to the church.

3
00:02:19,408 --> 00:02:21,472
Well, after the church then?

4
00:02:21,572 --> 00:02:24,229
C'mon, we haven't seen
you for so long.

5
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:30,169
Take this, I don't want
your little baby to get sick.

6
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:33,103
It's so cold out.

7
00:02:37,185 --> 00:02:39,499
- C'mon.
- OK.

8
00:02:44,904 --> 00:02:47,157
You'll come?

9
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:49,859
Oh yeah.

10
00:02:51,013 --> 00:02:52,461
Great.

11
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:56,315
- Could you put that whole thing on...?
- Oh yeah.

00:03:17,195 --> 00:03:20,155
- You owe me 5 dollars.
- Oh oh...

15
00:03:23,181 --> 00:03:26,412
Until I sit at the table, I don't owe you anything.

16
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:31,302
Something is going on with him.
I am worried.

17
00:03:31,402 --> 00:03:34,923
You keep saying that, I think you're--

18
00:03:35,324 --> 00:03:38,815
I think the other things may be kicking in.

19
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:46,757
<i>In all the world...</i>

20
00:03:46,857 --> 00:03:51,696
<i>there are books and books and books of Lords.</i>

21
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:56,850
<i>But in all this world there
really is only one Lord.</i>

22
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:01,800
<i>We need never ask:
'Lord, what should I do'?</i>

23
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,988
<i>Because the Lord has told us
what to do.</i>

24
00:04:06,088 --> 00:04:09,157
<i>Love one another.</i>

25
00:04:09,256 --> 00:04:14,201
<i>That my friends, is the one true Lord.</i>

26
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,805
<i>Love is God in action.</i>

27
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:21,711
<i>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
The love of God...</i>

28
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,319
<i>The fellowship of the Holy Spirit
be with you for now and for evermore.</i>

29
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,496
<i>Amen.</i>

30
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:39,851
- This is when you want some help.
- Oh, thank you, dear.

31
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:43,928
It's my turn to drop them off at the hospital.

32
00:04:46,835 --> 00:04:49,626
You know... you're a good looking fellow, Lars.

33
00:04:49,725 --> 00:04:51,386
Where's your girlfriend?

34
00:04:51,486 --> 00:04:52,941
I don't have one.

35
00:04:53,242 --> 00:04:54,833
- Are you gay?
- No.

36
00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:56,933
My grandson is gay,
I know all about the gays.

37
00:04:57,487 --> 00:04:59,730
I know, but I am not gay, so...

38
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,134
Well... don't leave it too long,
it's not good for you.

39
00:05:06,378 --> 00:05:08,302
Here.

40
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,208
Give this to somebody nice, for a start.

41
00:05:16,907 --> 00:05:19,289
Hello, Lars.

42
00:05:34,146 --> 00:05:38,360
- I guess I'll see you at work tomorrow.
- Yeah, okay, fine.

43
00:05:41,957 --> 00:05:45,202
Karin, remember, he is 27 years old.
Maybe he wants to be left alone.

44
00:05:45,302 --> 00:05:47,302
- That's not what he wants.
- Oh, really?

45
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,500
- How do you know that, exactly?
- Because...

46
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:54,762
that's not how people are.

47
00:05:57,336 --> 00:05:59,711
Ah, there he goes.

48
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:07,079
Lars, c'mon, you promised.

49
00:06:13,878 --> 00:06:17,167
- Is that normal?
- Five dollars.

50
00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:03,349
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Cindy.

51
00:07:03,448 --> 00:07:06,014
Did you have a nice weekend?

52
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:10,157
That new girl is kinda cute, huh?

53
00:07:10,256 --> 00:07:13,019
You and Margo? What do you think?

54
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:27,386
Lars, you gotta see this.

55
00:07:27,486 --> 00:07:29,685
I am not in the mood for porn this morning.

56
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:31,738
It's not porn.

57
00:07:33,564 --> 00:07:36,585
Okay... it is, but check it out, alright?

58
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,833
You like?

59
00:07:39,932 --> 00:07:45,760
Man it's solid. Like if she'd weigh 125 pounds,
then she weighs 125 pounds.

60
00:07:46,561 --> 00:07:49,342
You can customize everything,
they got all different heads and parts.

61
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:52,337
You can design your own woman.

62
00:07:54,338 --> 00:07:58,338
- And Lars, Lars.
- Yeah.

63
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:02,930
They're anatomically correct.

64
00:08:08,769 --> 00:08:10,792
Not gonna buy one, aren't ya?

65
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:13,110
I wish...

66
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,884
Look how much they cost.
Wiped out for a new Xbox.

67
00:08:18,335 --> 00:08:20,946
Morning.

68
00:08:21,046 --> 00:08:23,897
- Morning.
- Oh hey, yeah, good morning.

69
00:08:23,997 --> 00:08:26,470
Margo is here, everybody. Hooray.

70
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:33,548
Could you put the...?

71
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:43,977
Yeah, I was thinking. We're the only ones
from the lake, we could car-pool.

72
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:48,899
Lars, it's your day for coffee, buddy.

73
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:51,084
Oh yeah.

74
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:57,776
You know what your problem is, Margo?
You're just too aggressive.

75
00:08:57,876 --> 00:09:00,846
Just... chill-lax, ya know.

76
00:09:01,347 --> 00:09:02,938
Shut up.

77
00:09:11,441 --> 00:09:14,014
Wait, stop. Stop!

78
00:09:14,658 --> 00:09:18,869
Karin, what? What?

79
00:09:19,623 --> 00:09:22,084
We want you to come for dinner.

80
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:26,245
Will you come?

81
00:09:33,444 --> 00:09:36,672
- You scared me.
- Sorry.

82
00:09:37,962 --> 00:09:40,081
Sweetheart, sorry.

83
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,703
Wait.

84
00:09:42,804 --> 00:09:46,269
- I can't... I can't.
- Why not? No.

85
00:09:47,232 --> 00:09:50,935
Why not?
Lars, we miss you.

86
00:09:54,098 --> 00:09:57,633
I brought my work home,
so I have to... I'll get in trouble.

87
00:09:58,434 --> 00:09:59,294
No, you didn't.

88
00:09:59,394 --> 00:10:02,094
Yeah? Did you hear that?
That's my phone, I think.

89
00:10:02,193 --> 00:10:05,040
Come on, wait.
Lars, stop. Stop!

90
00:10:08,535 --> 00:10:11,945
- Come on, please?
- I... I have other plans...

91
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,362
and I can't.

92
00:10:15,863 --> 00:10:18,794
There is salmon, and cherry pie in there.

93
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,697
- Would you please let me go?
- No.

94
00:10:27,098 --> 00:10:28,698
Okay.

95
00:10:43,797 --> 00:10:47,456
- Is that all you can eat?
- Yeah, that was delicious. Thank you.

96
00:10:47,556 --> 00:10:50,699
No no, you stay there.
It's my turn.

97
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:53,952
You boys talk.

98
00:11:01,924 --> 00:11:06,308
Okay. Karin's been worried about you.
She thinks you got a problem...

99
00:11:06,408 --> 00:11:09,317
because you spend so much time by yourself.

100
00:11:12,353 --> 00:11:15,521
- I'm fine.
- That's what I told her.

101
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:18,165
It's exactly what I said.

102
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:23,308
Dad was kinda like that too, so...

103
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:27,363
Yeah, but he didn't want anyone around him.
So that's a difference.

104
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:31,879
That's not true.

105
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:38,599
Okay, you know, yeah sure,
maybe after Mom died, but...

106
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:41,366
You didn't know them before that, so...

107
00:11:42,421 --> 00:11:46,707
I mean nothing you could have.
I'm just saying...

108
00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:02,967
Karin and I would really like it
if you moved in.

109
00:12:04,561 --> 00:12:09,184
- No, that's okay, thank you.
- The house is half yours.

110
00:12:09,485 --> 00:12:12,469
Yeah, I know. But I'm fine, thanks.

111
00:12:13,222 --> 00:12:15,618
Just putting that there.

112
00:12:19,795 --> 00:12:22,934
- Good night. Sleep tight.
- Good night.

113
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,232
Oh wait. Here are some leftovers for you.

114
00:12:26,332 --> 00:12:28,698
Do you have my blanket?

115
00:12:28,797 --> 00:12:32,261
- Oh yeah, it's on...
- I'll get, I'll get it. Grab these.

116
00:12:32,462 --> 00:12:34,631
Be right back.

117
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:40,151
It's a beautiful blanket.

118
00:12:40,251 --> 00:12:42,595
- Gus says your mother made it for you.
- Yeah.

119
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,016
When she was pregnant.

120
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,320
Well she must've loved you very much,

121
00:12:50,921 --> 00:12:52,749
like we do.

122
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,916
- Are you mad at me?
- Is he coming?

123
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,916
Here we go.

124
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,190
- Good night.
- Thanks. Good night.

125
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,390
What?
We talked. He's fine.

126
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,590
Six weeks later...

127
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:01,766
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Lars. Karin.</i>

128
00:14:01,865 --> 00:14:05,150
<i>They just delivered a huge box for you.
It's in the garage.</i>

129
00:14:06,795 --> 00:14:10,728
- Oh... Okay, thanks.
- Okay, bye.

130
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:12,962
Thanks.

131
00:15:12,468 --> 00:15:14,639
That's a nice sweater.

132
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,172
Hey.
Come on in.

133
00:15:38,254 --> 00:15:41,047
That's okay. Can Karin
come to the door?

134
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,628
- Karin.
- Yeah?

135
00:15:43,728 --> 00:15:46,131
Honey, come here, it's Lars.

136
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,824
- Oh... Really?
- Yup.

137
00:15:49,721 --> 00:15:54,161
She is just.... doing that several kinda...

138
00:15:54,462 --> 00:15:57,715
It's pregnant women's yoga.

139
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:03,000
That's good good stuff.

140
00:16:03,099 --> 00:16:04,246
- Hey.
- Hi.

141
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:06,426
What's up?

142
00:16:09,923 --> 00:16:12,946
I have a visitor.

143
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:15,469
You have a...?

144
00:16:15,568 --> 00:16:19,031
- Yeah.
- A visitor?

145
00:16:19,432 --> 00:16:21,999
That... it's great.

146
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,000
Yeah.

147
00:16:25,223 --> 00:16:28,248
- And she's not from here.
- She?

148
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:34,708
Wow. What do you... what do you..
what do you know... did... where...?

149
00:16:34,808 --> 00:16:36,833
Where did you meet this person?

150
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:40,673
- On the Internet.
- Yeah, everybody's doing that now.

151
00:16:41,053 --> 00:16:43,026
That's great.

152
00:16:44,246 --> 00:16:47,066
She doesn't speak much English though.

153
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:49,073
It's okay. It's the same...

154
00:16:49,223 --> 00:16:51,981
It's really the same with the guys at work.
It's... not that big a deal.

155
00:16:52,081 --> 00:16:54,081
Okay.

156
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,394
Yeah, well, ya know, she is in a wheelchair,

157
00:16:58,494 --> 00:17:01,027
so I just don't want you to feel weird about it.

158
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:03,078
- No, no.
- We don't care.

159
00:17:04,475 --> 00:17:08,615
And I have to ask you really,
I know it's a really big favor.

160
00:17:09,316 --> 00:17:10,316
Yeah?

161
00:17:12,911 --> 00:17:16,709
She's just really religious,
and because we're both young

162
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:21,021
and single, it just doesn't feel right for
us to stay in the garage...

163
00:17:21,122 --> 00:17:24,296
- Oh no, no... We'll put her in the pink room.
- No, she can sleep here.

164
00:17:24,397 --> 00:17:27,280
- In the pink room?
- Yeah... sure.

165
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:30,249
And there are new towels.

166
00:17:32,904 --> 00:17:37,819
Just give us half an hour,
you know, pick up... and get something in the oven,

167
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,706
- Okey dokey.
-...get the place ready.

168
00:17:40,807 --> 00:17:42,257
Yes.

169
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,727
- Okay, let's get us get started.
- Right.

170
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:51,668
That is...

171
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,989
You quiet ones...
You know what they say about the...

172
00:17:57,402 --> 00:17:59,255
It's great.

173
00:17:59,356 --> 00:18:01,943
- See you in a little bit.
- Okay.

174
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,122
Bianca is a missionary.

175
00:18:28,923 --> 00:18:31,423
Or was a missionary. Right, sorry.

176
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:33,034
Because she was raised by nuns.

177
00:18:33,134 --> 00:18:35,152
But now she is on a sabbatical
so she can experience the world.

178
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:36,252
Isn't that neat?

179
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:45,891
She's shy.

180
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:47,973
Well, you are.

181
00:18:49,374 --> 00:18:51,618
Everything is so new...

182
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:54,431
for her, right?

183
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,990
- Are you hungry?
- We are starving.

184
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,777
Gus, will you give me a hand
in the kitchen?

185
00:19:13,848 --> 00:19:17,487
That was that.
I know.

186
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,892
- He is crazy, right? He's crazy, Karin.
- Shhh.

187
00:19:31,557 --> 00:19:34,779
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

188
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:42,967
My God...Karin.
We got to put him in a hospital, I think.

189
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:45,357
Can't just put him in a hospital.
I can't afford that.

190
00:19:45,457 --> 00:19:49,409
I can't believe this.
My little brother is totally, totally insane.

191
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:53,947
Put yourself together.
Gus, shh, calm down. Calm down, okay?

192
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:57,024
He's talking to a doll, baby.

193
00:19:57,425 --> 00:19:59,598
We just gonna get through this somehow okay?

194
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,087
- I just don't know how am I gonna do that.
- I don't either,

195
00:20:02,188 --> 00:20:05,965
but you're gonna be calm, okay?

196
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:07,466
Okay.

197
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:12,945
- I am sorry.
- It's okay.

198
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:19,563
Karin, Karin, she's not gonna eat.

199
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:50,653
So you're never gonna believe this...

200
00:20:50,753 --> 00:20:53,020
Makes me mad.

201
00:20:53,521 --> 00:20:56,103
Bianca's from the tropics...

202
00:20:56,204 --> 00:20:58,766
She was-- She is Brazilian.

203
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:02,606
Half Brazilian, half Danish, that's right...

204
00:21:03,907 --> 00:21:04,907
and...

205
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,693
somebody stole her luggage.

206
00:21:09,725 --> 00:21:13,136
Yeah, and they stole her wheelchair.

207
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,183
That's terrible.

208
00:21:19,284 --> 00:21:22,139
Yeah. Can you believe that, Gus?

209
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:25,600
- Yeah, I can believe it.
- Right.

210
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:29,851
Well it... it makes me angry.

211
00:21:30,352 --> 00:21:32,987
Anyway...

212
00:21:33,588 --> 00:21:35,961
I wanted to ask you a favor.

213
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:38,321
She doesn't lie, I promise you.

214
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:42,745
Karin, you don't mind lending Bianca some clothes, do you?
She doesn't have any.

215
00:21:54,922 --> 00:21:56,264
Do you?

216
00:21:56,365 --> 00:21:58,940
I'm not sure we are the same type, Lars.

217
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,412
That's okay, Karin, because...

218
00:22:01,513 --> 00:22:06,709
Bianca doesn't really care about
superficial things like that. So it's okay.

219
00:22:14,172 --> 00:22:17,313
- Sure.
- Yeah, that's right.

220
00:22:17,414 --> 00:22:19,467
See? I told you.

221
00:22:19,568 --> 00:22:21,620
Thanks.

222
00:22:24,172 --> 00:22:26,952
This used to be my mom's room.

223
00:22:27,653 --> 00:22:32,214
So... if you need anything, Gus and Karin
are right across the hall.

224
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:34,481
I'm in the garage.

225
00:22:35,182 --> 00:22:37,994
But you know that, so...
What else?

226
00:22:38,795 --> 00:22:42,300
Your towels are brand new,
thanks to Karin.

227
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:48,671
Lars, I... I think we should...
think we should go to bed, you know.

228
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:52,574
Just see you in one second.

229
00:22:53,275 --> 00:22:57,076
I just wanted to say that I'm so glad
you're finally here.

230
00:22:58,042 --> 00:23:01,613
Lars, I...
I think right now we...

231
00:23:01,872 --> 00:23:04,826
Yeah, okay. Good night.

232
00:23:14,635 --> 00:23:17,587
Wait, Gus had a good idea.

233
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:22,100
He's... he's concerned about Bianca's health.

234
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:26,956
You know just with the traveling, and...
and change of climate and everything...

235
00:23:27,057 --> 00:23:29,067
What stress, you know?

236
00:23:29,768 --> 00:23:34,012
I'll make an appointment with Dr. Birnman
for tomorrow. For early tomorrow.

237
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:39,018
- We'll all go.
- Yeah, you remember Dagmar?

238
00:23:40,964 --> 00:23:44,476
- You think that's a good idea?
- I do, I think we should do it.

239
00:23:44,576 --> 00:23:51,205
Yeah, that's a good idea, because I was gonna go
shopping for a wheelchair anyway.

240
00:23:51,406 --> 00:23:54,106
- So, good night.
- Good night.

241
00:23:54,206 --> 00:23:56,465
I'll see you tomorrow.

242
00:25:05,788 --> 00:25:07,209
'Real Doll'

243
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,946
<i>Natasha escaped from Moscow,</i>

244
00:25:10,047 --> 00:25:13,009
<i>where she was forced to strip
for the Russian mob.</i>

245
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:16,662
<i>Now all she wants is an all American male to love.</i>

246
00:25:16,763 --> 00:25:19,381
<i>Nadori left a high paying job in Tokyo</i>

247
00:25:19,482 --> 00:25:23,133
<i>because she was unsatisfied as a woman.</i>

248
00:25:23,234 --> 00:25:26,867
<i>Tammy dropped out the high school
to join the rodeo.</i>

249
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:31,858
<i>Are you the right cowboy to tame this wild billy?</i>

250
00:25:45,318 --> 00:25:48,291
The doctor will tell us what to do.

251
00:25:48,892 --> 00:25:51,447
But she is family practice.
We gonna need a shrink.

252
00:25:51,548 --> 00:25:54,920
No, she is.
She's a psychologist too.

253
00:25:57,842 --> 00:26:01,088
She says you have to be, this far north.

254
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:08,144
What would people think?

255
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:12,935
We can't worry about that.

256
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:18,241
Right.

257
00:26:35,033 --> 00:26:37,889
Right there is where my dad used to work.

258
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:40,992
Our dad.

259
00:26:41,593 --> 00:26:45,880
That's the library. I have a card
you can borrow if you want to.

260
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:50,548
Well, actually I'll have to take them out for you.
But you just tell...

261
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,553
I don't know actually, Gus...

262
00:26:55,654 --> 00:26:57,782
What was it that dad did?

263
00:26:57,883 --> 00:27:00,922
Water and power.

264
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:13,220
My job is at the school department.

265
00:27:15,541 --> 00:27:19,310
I miss everybody, but there's so much to do in the house.

266
00:27:19,611 --> 00:27:23,612
I'll go back, just as soon as the baby's old enough
and... you're...

267
00:27:40,781 --> 00:27:44,613
Yeah sure.'Readers Digest'.

268
00:27:46,117 --> 00:27:49,285
Then there is 'Living' or 'Country'.

269
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:52,904
That's what I would say.

270
00:28:08,513 --> 00:28:11,167
Her blood pressure is low.

271
00:28:15,163 --> 00:28:19,697
- Is that serious?
- Could be. I'll have to wait and see.

272
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:28,575
It's fine.
Mine is probably low too.

273
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:40,305
I want you to bring her in every week
for special treatment.

274
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:43,482
Can you do that?

275
00:28:47,153 --> 00:28:50,833
Yeah, are you sure that that is necessary?

276
00:28:51,891 --> 00:28:55,645
- Yes.
- Okay, okay.

277
00:28:56,871 --> 00:28:58,877
What do you think?

278
00:28:58,977 --> 00:29:02,741
All that's what she says, I'm sure.

279
00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:08,719
You can set that up with Jo-Anne,
at the desk.

280
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:13,709
I look forward to getting to know you, Bianca.

281
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:20,159
Karin, I'm telling you, he belongs in a hospital.

282
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,359
No.

283
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,714
No. My uncle Garth went to one of these places
and he never came back.

284
00:29:24,815 --> 00:29:27,079
But he needs more help than
you and I are able to give.

285
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,100
I told you that something was wrong
and you wouldn't listen.

286
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:31,199
If I may?

287
00:29:32,274 --> 00:29:36,927
Has Lars been functional? Does he
go to work, wash, dress himself?

288
00:29:37,228 --> 00:29:39,097
So far.

289
00:29:39,998 --> 00:29:44,314
- Has he had any violent episodes?
- No, never.

290
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,974
He's a sweetheart.
He never even raises his voice.

291
00:29:47,075 --> 00:29:48,225
Okay.

292
00:29:48,491 --> 00:29:50,604
We got to fix him, can you fix him?

293
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,822
I don't know, Gus.

294
00:29:53,952 --> 00:29:57,411
I don't believe he's psychotic or schizophrenic.

295
00:29:57,512 --> 00:30:01,985
I don't think this is caused by genes
or faulty wiring in the brain.

296
00:30:02,086 --> 00:30:04,154
So what the hell is goin' on then?

297
00:30:04,255 --> 00:30:07,530
- He appears to have a delusion.
- A delusion?

298
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:10,675
What the hell is he doing with a delusion,
for Christ's sake?

299
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:13,285
That's what we have to find out.

300
00:30:13,386 --> 00:30:16,734
Chances are, he's been decompensating for some time.

301
00:30:18,911 --> 00:30:21,564
Guess we didn't realize.

302
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,290
Have there been any changes in the family
in the last year or so?

303
00:30:28,691 --> 00:30:34,833
No, everything is pretty much exactly the same,
except that Karin is pregnant and Lars is nuts.

304
00:30:35,241 --> 00:30:38,103
You know, this isn't necessarily a bad thing.

305
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:42,613
What we call mental illness
isn't always just an illness...

306
00:30:42,713 --> 00:30:46,882
It can be a communication,
it can be a way to work something out.

307
00:30:47,283 --> 00:30:49,317
Fantastic. When will it be over?

308
00:30:49,646 --> 00:30:52,005
When he doesn't need it anymore.

309
00:30:54,362 --> 00:30:57,393
How can we help?

310
00:30:59,746 --> 00:31:03,633
- Go along with it.
- Oh no. No that's...

311
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:07,321
No no...
No I mean...

312
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:09,311
Pretend that she is real? I'm not gonna do that,

313
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:11,053
I mean, I can't. I'm just not gonna do it.

314
00:31:11,154 --> 00:31:12,885
- She is real.
- Well...

315
00:31:14,266 --> 00:31:17,532
- She's right out there.
- Right, I get that.

316
00:31:17,633 --> 00:31:19,219
I'm just not gonna--
You know, I'm just not gonna--

317
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:20,112
I'm not gonna do it, so...

318
00:31:20,413 --> 00:31:22,936
You won't be able to change his mind anyway.

319
00:31:23,037 --> 00:31:26,091
- Bianca's in town for a reason.
- Right, but... but...

320
00:31:26,192 --> 00:31:28,086
It's not really a choice.

321
00:31:32,793 --> 00:31:35,464
Then we'll do it, whatever it takes.

322
00:31:35,565 --> 00:31:38,963
Oh yeah, yeah, yup.
And everyone is gonna laugh at him.

323
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:40,615
And you.

324
00:31:54,188 --> 00:31:56,596
She loves kids.

325
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,930
- More coffee, Lars?
- Yes, please.

326
00:32:06,268 --> 00:32:08,799
May I see your funny face?

327
00:32:10,384 --> 00:32:13,503
Does Bianca want some?

328
00:32:14,104 --> 00:32:15,503
Yeah.

329
00:32:16,703 --> 00:32:19,158
- Here we go.
- Thank you, Karin.

330
00:32:19,258 --> 00:32:21,469
Gus, no? Okay.

331
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,646
Sure.

332
00:32:29,397 --> 00:32:31,759
You're not gonna go to work today, Gus?

333
00:32:34,076 --> 00:32:37,058
I don't feel good.

334
00:32:39,518 --> 00:32:42,661
Bianca could help you,
you know, she has nurse's training.

335
00:32:42,762 --> 00:32:47,087
No, she doesn't.
She doesn't have nurse's training, Lars,

336
00:32:47,188 --> 00:32:48,686
because she's not a person.

337
00:32:49,186 --> 00:32:51,518
She's a big plastic thing.

338
00:32:52,615 --> 00:32:54,991
That's amazing.

339
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:58,891
Did you hear that?

340
00:32:59,192 --> 00:33:03,246
Bianca just said that that's why
God made her, to help people.

341
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,174
You're gonna be late...

342
00:33:13,775 --> 00:33:15,275
for work?

343
00:33:19,835 --> 00:33:22,217
I am gonna be late.

344
00:33:22,318 --> 00:33:24,593
Well, I have to go. Okay.

345
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:29,519
- I'm going to check in...
- Okay.

346
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,737
- And you have my number at work, right Karin?
- Yup.

347
00:33:39,765 --> 00:33:43,261
I wanted to tell you that you
look really pretty today.

348
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:50,240
I hope that you'll feel better, Gus.

349
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:55,001
- Me too.
- And thanks so much for breakfast.

350
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,471
- Ok, gotta go. Bye.
- See you.

351
00:34:03,194 --> 00:34:05,377
Well, I had to try, you know.

352
00:34:06,963 --> 00:34:09,115
What? What?

353
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:12,617
It's just...
I don't know.

354
00:34:14,526 --> 00:34:18,293
It is true. We've been all wrapped up
in ourselves. We have, Gus.

355
00:34:18,394 --> 00:34:20,526
This is not my fault though.

356
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:22,652
Not my fault.

357
00:34:29,144 --> 00:34:32,445
Come on, Bianca.
Let's make a couple of calls.

358
00:34:48,325 --> 00:34:50,409
Good morning, Cindy.
You look pretty today.

359
00:34:50,509 --> 00:34:53,096
Thank you.
Oh, Mr. Sunshine.

360
00:34:55,996 --> 00:34:57,981
It's a while advanced,
but...

361
00:34:58,081 --> 00:35:01,320
you know how excited
I get about these things.

362
00:35:07,707 --> 00:35:09,670
- Alright, where are they? I know you took them.
- I did not.

363
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,390
- That's revenge.
- For what?

364
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,490
For the fake... I put on your floor.

365
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:18,401
- Oh, that.
- Lars, I'm missing 3 of my action figures.

366
00:35:20,147 --> 00:35:21,848
It's your turn to get coffee.

367
00:35:21,948 --> 00:35:26,717
Okay, listen up Margo, those action figures
are extremely important to me, alright?

368
00:35:26,817 --> 00:35:30,498
They worth a lot of money, and if I don't see
every damn one back on my desk pretty soon,

369
00:35:30,598 --> 00:35:34,863
then you can tell your Teddy bear
to watch his back.

370
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:48,583
I'll return them... one at a time.

371
00:35:53,211 --> 00:35:55,294
You're going to Cindy's party?

372
00:35:55,394 --> 00:35:58,113
Oh, no.

373
00:35:58,621 --> 00:36:02,770
I was hoping you would,
I really wish you would.

374
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:06,021
Well, maybe.

375
00:36:07,122 --> 00:36:09,228
That'd be great.

376
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:13,022
Do you think I can bring my girlfriend?

377
00:36:15,286 --> 00:36:18,974
Yeah, yeah, I'm totally bringing somebody.

378
00:36:28,213 --> 00:36:32,238
- I didn't know there were sex dolls.
- Love dolls, that's what they call 'em.

379
00:36:33,313 --> 00:36:38,159
- I saw a special in 'People'.
- So you are serious? Bianca has a...

380
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:43,688
So she is really just one of the girls...

381
00:36:44,891 --> 00:36:46,725
I am sorry.

382
00:36:46,825 --> 00:36:48,825
[speaking Spanish (?)]

383
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,164
No way.

384
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,784
She has a sister?

385
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:05,140
I wish I had a woman that couldn't talk.

386
00:37:08,755 --> 00:37:10,844
It's not that funny. It's not that funny.

387
00:37:10,945 --> 00:37:14,512
We don't want anything to do with her.
She is a 'golden calf'.

388
00:37:15,535 --> 00:37:18,223
- We all know what happened with that.
- Well, he's not worshipping her.

389
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:21,642
- They're just dating?
- These young people have no willpower.

390
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:24,164
He is sick, alright. He's sick.

391
00:37:24,264 --> 00:37:27,568
Yes. We were just hoping if we came to you,
you could help.

392
00:37:27,668 --> 00:37:30,219
You know, just pave the way a little.

393
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,892
If you could just try to understand it...

394
00:37:32,992 --> 00:37:36,071
We can try.

395
00:37:36,372 --> 00:37:39,448
This is all, for heaven's sake.
What's the big deal?

396
00:37:40,991 --> 00:37:44,891
Sally, your cousin puts dresses on his cats.

397
00:37:45,449 --> 00:37:49,950
Hazel, your nephew gave all his money
to a UFO club.

398
00:37:50,451 --> 00:37:53,179
And Ernie, everybody knows your
first wife was a klepto.

399
00:37:53,279 --> 00:37:56,660
- She wasn't.
- Then why has she buried a pair of my earrings?

400
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,938
Now that's enough.

401
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:01,141
These things happen.

402
00:38:02,837 --> 00:38:04,841
Lars is a good boy.

403
00:38:08,178 --> 00:38:10,469
You can depend on me.

404
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:12,791
Thanks Mrs. Gruner.

405
00:38:14,157 --> 00:38:17,101
He's not bringing it to the church,
is he, Reverend Bock?

406
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,529
The question is, as always...

407
00:38:26,134 --> 00:38:28,135
What would Jesus do?

408
00:38:54,868 --> 00:38:57,196
<i>I would like to take the opportunity</i>

409
00:38:57,296 --> 00:39:00,919
<i>to welcome all of our new visitors
to our church today.</i>

410
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,427
Bianca, it's good to see you.
Lars, God bless, God bless.

411
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:09,721
- Thank you so much, Reverend.
- You're welcome, my dear.

412
00:39:17,108 --> 00:39:19,868
These are for you, Bianca.

413
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:23,476
This is my friend, Mrs. Gruner.

414
00:39:25,355 --> 00:39:27,643
She has a darling figure.

415
00:39:31,743 --> 00:39:33,043
Those are nice, huh?

416
00:39:33,143 --> 00:39:34,943
They are not real,
so they'll last forever.

417
00:39:35,043 --> 00:39:36,343
Isn't that neat?

418
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:44,152
Get back here.

419
00:40:20,365 --> 00:40:23,273
Watch watch watch... there we go.

420
00:40:25,773 --> 00:40:27,773
Are you comfortable?
Yeah?

421
00:40:28,871 --> 00:40:30,964
I'll get the chair.

422
00:40:31,064 --> 00:40:33,418
Oh can you... can you put a seat belt on her?

423
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:36,961
Bianca, Gus' gonna put on your seat belt.

424
00:40:37,807 --> 00:40:40,864
Can you put that on her legs because
she gets cold. Thank you.

425
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:55,094
Thanks Gus.

426
00:40:56,957 --> 00:41:00,137
Where are you guys...
Where are you going?

427
00:41:03,165 --> 00:41:05,257
Just one second.

428
00:41:06,176 --> 00:41:09,644
She doesn't know. It's a secret,
but I can tell you.

429
00:41:09,745 --> 00:41:11,716
It's just she's asking me lots of
questions all the time.

430
00:41:11,816 --> 00:41:13,357
She wants to know everything about me so...

431
00:41:13,457 --> 00:41:16,664
I thought I would take her to the lake

432
00:41:17,213 --> 00:41:18,634
where we used to play.

433
00:41:18,735 --> 00:41:20,801
- Yeah.
- Do you remember that?

434
00:41:21,001 --> 00:41:21,594
Yeah.

435
00:41:22,836 --> 00:41:25,377
It sounds... yeah, that sounds nice.

436
00:41:26,873 --> 00:41:29,028
Yeah.
I gotta go.

437
00:41:29,128 --> 00:41:31,399
I'm coming.
Why are you yelling?

438
00:41:54,499 --> 00:41:56,499
Gus and his friends used to come here often.

439
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:58,599
In the summer they would go fishing,

440
00:41:59,999 --> 00:42:01,999
and in the winter,
they would play hockey.

441
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:06,055
they would build cool forts, like,

442
00:42:07,605 --> 00:42:08,299
snow hoards.

443
00:42:09,699 --> 00:42:11,699
Watch your head.

444
00:42:18,762 --> 00:42:22,931
Okay this is a treehouse, and a rope swing,

445
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:26,348
and a ladder.

446
00:42:29,648 --> 00:42:31,648
(Mental illness delusion)

447
00:42:34,348 --> 00:42:36,348
(Delusional Disorder)

448
00:43:36,593 --> 00:43:39,089
You should watch me chop wood too.

449
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,903
I'm really good at it.

450
00:43:52,108 --> 00:43:54,353
I am sorry.

451
00:43:54,454 --> 00:43:57,901
I couldn't wait any longer, I wanted to
see how she was doing

452
00:43:58,001 --> 00:44:02,169
After the treatment she has to rest
Doesn't work without the resting

453
00:44:05,148 --> 00:44:06,650
Keep me company.

454
00:44:07,251 --> 00:44:08,451
Lars,

455
00:44:08,851 --> 00:44:10,840
keep me company.

456
00:44:20,811 --> 00:44:23,912
Do you know how many sessions
she's gonna have to have?

457
00:44:26,685 --> 00:44:30,602
No, I don't, it's a tricky illness, Lars.

458
00:44:31,403 --> 00:44:37,177
But you know what I could use is
a more complete history on her, like parents...

459
00:44:37,278 --> 00:44:40,695
Oh, they died when she was a baby.

460
00:44:42,506 --> 00:44:45,335
- That's not fair.
- Yeah, but...

461
00:44:45,636 --> 00:44:49,757
She doesn't feel sorry for herself or anything,
she just wants to be normal.

462
00:44:49,858 --> 00:44:52,417
Have everyone treating her normal.

463
00:44:54,345 --> 00:44:57,088
That's nice. I admire that.

464
00:44:57,188 --> 00:45:00,121
Yeah, me too.
Is that your husband?

465
00:45:00,221 --> 00:45:03,645
Yes, he died.

466
00:45:03,746 --> 00:45:07,786
Oh no, I am sorry.

467
00:45:09,785 --> 00:45:12,337
- You have kids?
- No.

468
00:45:17,037 --> 00:45:18,989
You must feel really lonely.

469
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:23,506
Sometimes I get so lonely that I forget
what day it is and how to spell my name.

470
00:45:29,636 --> 00:45:32,248
How about you?

471
00:45:34,555 --> 00:45:36,878
You are funny.

472
00:45:37,933 --> 00:45:41,265
So what's the difference between a delusion
and a hallucination?

473
00:45:42,377 --> 00:45:45,806
It's false perception versus false belief.

474
00:45:45,906 --> 00:45:48,000
So if Mous thinks the FBI's after him...

475
00:45:48,101 --> 00:45:49,588
- The DEA.
- INS.

476
00:45:49,688 --> 00:45:53,704
- IRS, ATF, AAA.
- I doubt it would be a delusion.

477
00:45:53,804 --> 00:45:56,721
Now dude, they're all after us.

478
00:46:02,721 --> 00:46:04,073
<i>My dad told me that...</i>

479
00:46:07,123 --> 00:46:08,421
that wood warms you.

480
00:46:09,221 --> 00:46:11,221
<i>Three times:</i>

481
00:46:11,321 --> 00:46:13,321
<i>First when you chop down your tree.</i>

482
00:46:13,421 --> 00:46:15,421
<i>Then when you chop it up,</i>

483
00:46:15,521 --> 00:46:17,521
<i>then when you burn it.</i>

484
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:36,223
What are we doing?
Why are we doing this for him?

485
00:46:36,373 --> 00:46:37,026
Oh c'mon.

486
00:46:39,764 --> 00:46:42,425
That's funny.

487
00:46:42,526 --> 00:46:44,389
Is it?

488
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:49,970
I don't know.
I don't know, maybe not.

489
00:46:55,653 --> 00:46:57,407
So tell me about Karin.

490
00:46:59,657 --> 00:47:01,021
I don't know her very well.

491
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:03,462
Oh, she is wonderful.

492
00:47:03,562 --> 00:47:06,683
Gus and I are both very lucky with
Women. She's wonderful.

493
00:47:09,456 --> 00:47:12,440
But she--

494
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:18,200
We don't have to talk.
Let's find you something to read.

495
00:47:18,601 --> 00:47:20,706
No, it's just...

496
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:24,075
-...between us.
- Of course.

497
00:47:27,489 --> 00:47:29,998
I'm worried about her.

498
00:47:30,299 --> 00:47:32,666
I think she has a little problem.

499
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:36,741
- Oh, maybe you shouldn't tell me.
- No, it's okay. It's just...

500
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:43,369
I think it's because
she is insecure but...

501
00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:46,180
she's just always trying to hug everybody.

502
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,388
You know, some people don't like that.
Some people don't like to be hugged.

503
00:47:50,488 --> 00:47:53,859
But she doesn't realize that.
She takes it personally.

504
00:47:53,959 --> 00:47:57,538
And things...
You know, it hurts her feelings.

505
00:48:01,233 --> 00:48:03,606
I don't know what to do about that.

506
00:48:05,394 --> 00:48:07,077
Do you?

507
00:48:07,177 --> 00:48:09,427
But it's such a comfort sometimes

508
00:48:09,527 --> 00:48:13,416
just to have somebody's arms
around you, don't you think?

509
00:48:14,354 --> 00:48:17,609
- No.
- C'mon, it feels good.

510
00:48:18,588 --> 00:48:21,309
It does not feel good.
It hurts.

511
00:48:24,749 --> 00:48:27,532
Like a cut or a bruise?

512
00:48:27,633 --> 00:48:31,193
Like a burn.
Like, like when you go outside and...

513
00:48:31,294 --> 00:48:33,808
your feet freeze and then you come back in

514
00:48:33,908 --> 00:48:35,934
and they thaw out.
It's like that.

515
00:48:37,335 --> 00:48:39,468
It's almost exactly like that.

516
00:48:39,669 --> 00:48:42,005
Same with everybody?

517
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:47,005
I'm not really with Bianca.

518
00:48:50,181 --> 00:48:52,355
But everyone else.

519
00:48:52,456 --> 00:48:54,852
So you don't let people touch you.

520
00:48:55,353 --> 00:48:57,847
Lars, isn't that hard to get away with?

521
00:48:59,277 --> 00:49:03,848
I'm not really here, because
I have all these layers.

522
00:49:05,092 --> 00:49:08,093
- And that helps.
- Look...

523
00:49:08,194 --> 00:49:10,654
We can't change Karin.

524
00:49:11,155 --> 00:49:12,719
But...

525
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,420
I can help you.

526
00:49:22,773 --> 00:49:24,905
That's fine.

527
00:49:29,377 --> 00:49:32,452
- Pain?
- Yeah, but I can take it.

528
00:49:42,645 --> 00:49:44,988
You okay?

529
00:49:48,014 --> 00:49:50,121
That's enough for today.

530
00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:52,395
Yeah, thanks.

531
00:49:59,822 --> 00:50:01,569
Yeah, okay.

532
00:50:13,827 --> 00:50:19,392
It's scientifically proven that everyone's
favourite word is their own names so...

533
00:50:19,963 --> 00:50:24,611
if you just say their names a lot...
You okay?

534
00:50:26,302 --> 00:50:29,503
You can see that it's gonna make them happy.

535
00:51:02,871 --> 00:51:09,766
Mr. Sunshine, and this must be Bianca.
Welcome, welcome. Come on in.

536
00:51:18,261 --> 00:51:20,512
I have my boots on,
I should've brought my shoes.

537
00:51:20,612 --> 00:51:23,746
Don't worry about it.
Baxter, Baxter baby...

538
00:51:23,846 --> 00:51:27,476
Lars, this is my husband.

539
00:51:28,777 --> 00:51:29,777
Hi.

540
00:51:32,877 --> 00:51:34,477
Bianca.

541
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:37,601
How are you?

542
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:41,930
Is that for me, Bianca?
Thank you.

543
00:51:44,292 --> 00:51:48,560
Can Baxter get you two something to drink
from the kitchen?

544
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,360
Lars...?

545
00:52:03,326 --> 00:52:04,647
Beer.

546
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,200
And for Bianca?

547
00:52:09,574 --> 00:52:11,332
She doesn't drink.

548
00:52:11,733 --> 00:52:13,198
She doesn't like it when I drink either

549
00:52:13,348 --> 00:52:14,614
but I'm still gonna have one.

550
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:21,188
I can help you with the coats.

551
00:52:23,478 --> 00:52:25,963
This is Margo, this is Bianca.

552
00:52:26,063 --> 00:52:27,222
Hi.

553
00:52:28,023 --> 00:52:29,932
Hi Bianca.

554
00:52:33,756 --> 00:52:36,773
I'm glad you sent us that memo,
or I'd be freaked.

555
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:39,842
So bizarre.

556
00:52:39,942 --> 00:52:43,397
- It's a disorder
- What a nerder.

557
00:52:44,098 --> 00:52:45,098
Lars?

558
00:52:45,687 --> 00:52:46,897
Look at them.

559
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:50,398
He's in love with that sluggy hunk of silicone.

560
00:52:51,127 --> 00:52:53,560
- Her name is Bianca.
- Does he have sex with her?

561
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,205
Hell yes, that's what she's for, yeah.

562
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:57,305
Eww, Eww.

563
00:52:57,416 --> 00:52:59,587
So I hear you guys are getting married?

564
00:52:59,716 --> 00:53:00,587
- Yes.
- No.

565
00:53:13,719 --> 00:53:15,769
I would kill that hair like hers.

566
00:53:15,869 --> 00:53:20,253
Or I'd cut it like to here long
and short in the back.

567
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:24,282
Lars would never let her cut it.
Guys and long hair...

568
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:28,616
I don't care.

569
00:53:29,158 --> 00:53:32,053
I know how she likes it,
that's how I like it.

570
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,581
That's my kind of guy.

571
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,659
I need wine.

572
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:42,023
I'll get it.

573
00:53:43,043 --> 00:53:46,665
- Anything else?
- Oh no, thanks.

574
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:11,249
Lars, Bianca - a total babe.

575
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:13,201
Thanks.

576
00:54:13,301 --> 00:54:16,738
Best thing is, man:
she even knows how hot she is.

577
00:54:16,839 --> 00:54:18,633
That's what you want in a woman.

578
00:54:18,734 --> 00:54:21,408
They stay with you because they don't know
how to get somebody better.

579
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:24,507
Know what I am saying?

580
00:54:24,607 --> 00:54:27,642
Is she...flexible?

581
00:54:40,547 --> 00:54:42,442
Yes.

582
00:56:01,603 --> 00:56:03,645
Did you have fun?

583
00:56:18,345 --> 00:56:20,977
I'm just happy, that's all.

584
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:33,352
'And so he solaced himself with pacing
up and down the little meadow'

585
00:56:33,452 --> 00:56:36,073
'and writing and carving on the bark of the trees'

586
00:56:36,174 --> 00:56:39,023
'and on the fine sand a multitude of verses.'

587
00:56:39,123 --> 00:56:43,828
'All in harmony with his sadness,
and some in praise of Dulcinea.'

588
00:57:03,413 --> 00:57:09,003
'But what distressed him greatly was not having
another hermit there to confess him.'

589
00:57:35,651 --> 00:57:37,317
Pain?

590
00:57:38,012 --> 00:57:39,845
It's okay.

591
00:57:39,946 --> 00:57:42,541
That's okay. I can take that.

592
00:57:45,024 --> 00:57:47,956
You must be excited,
about the baby on the way.

593
00:57:51,629 --> 00:57:54,664
Don't you want to be an uncle?

594
00:58:03,423 --> 00:58:06,952
- Do you ever wanna be a mom?
- I don't know.

595
00:58:16,929 --> 00:58:19,201
Yes.

596
00:58:22,603 --> 00:58:25,676
But I'm not able to have children of my own.

597
00:58:28,977 --> 00:58:31,277
That's too bad.

598
00:58:41,249 --> 00:58:43,769
Bianca is like that actually.

599
00:58:50,116 --> 00:58:53,039
Yeah, she can't have babies either.

600
00:58:53,139 --> 00:58:55,254
That's a shame.

601
00:58:56,365 --> 00:58:59,972
When she was a baby,
her mother died in the middle of things, so

602
00:59:00,072 --> 00:59:02,063
when she was being born.

603
00:59:02,464 --> 00:59:04,755
Like yours.

604
00:59:06,086 --> 00:59:08,868
You have a lot in common.

605
00:59:17,365 --> 00:59:20,740
Lars, you know we...
we've learned a lot.

606
00:59:21,041 --> 00:59:24,196
Since then, I think your things are better.

607
00:59:24,296 --> 00:59:27,867
- Yeah, but it could still happen, right?
- It's highly unlikely.

608
00:59:27,967 --> 00:59:31,425
It's... it's... rare.

609
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,646
Yes, but it'd still occur.

610
00:59:37,335 --> 00:59:38,585
Lars.

611
00:59:38,685 --> 00:59:41,079
Just take... take a breath.

612
00:59:46,014 --> 00:59:48,147
It's okay.

613
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,234
I am sorry.

614
00:59:52,135 --> 00:59:54,667
I am sorry. It's just so dangerous.

615
00:59:54,968 --> 00:59:57,712
- It's so dangerous...
- Lars, sit down.

616
00:59:57,812 --> 01:00:02,329
Put your head between your knees.
Put your head between your knees. Sit down.

617
01:00:04,474 --> 01:00:07,754
Just put your head between your knees.
Bend over. Bend over.

618
01:00:07,955 --> 01:00:11,155
Okay, okay.
Okay.

619
01:00:13,632 --> 01:00:15,785
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

620
01:00:15,885 --> 01:00:18,044
Take a breath.

621
01:00:28,339 --> 01:00:33,258
I hope they have cell phones.
We should get cell phones, huh?

622
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:35,755
Then we can call each other
whenever we want...

623
01:00:35,855 --> 01:00:37,855
You know, you are doing all your things...

624
01:00:37,955 --> 01:00:39,955
and I like you.
You're special.

625
01:00:48,026 --> 01:00:52,322
How about afternoons?
Mondays, Wednesdays...

626
01:00:52,423 --> 01:00:54,730
and then maybe all day Saturday?

627
01:01:02,141 --> 01:01:05,494
Yeah, yeah. You're sure?
Ah, okay.

628
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:08,332
Bianca, is that okay with you?

629
01:01:08,433 --> 01:01:13,024
Bianca wants to volunteer at
the hospital on Thursday afternoons.

630
01:01:13,827 --> 01:01:16,258
You do?

631
01:01:16,796 --> 01:01:19,214
What about your blood pressure?

632
01:01:20,215 --> 01:01:23,694
Think of all the bald children
wouldn't they just love her?

633
01:01:24,778 --> 01:01:25,650
That's true.

634
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:27,750
I'll just add a little bit of layering here,
and some texture...

635
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,800
kinda right there...

636
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,651
I don't remember what you guys think, but...

637
01:01:35,231 --> 01:01:38,077
I like that.
That looks sweet.

638
01:01:39,076 --> 01:01:42,524
You sure?
This is not growing back, right?

639
01:01:45,812 --> 01:01:49,540
<i>What's that sound?
By Veronica Charles.</i>

640
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,521
<i>I hear the telephone.</i>

641
01:01:51,621 --> 01:01:52,979
Ring ring ring.

642
01:02:28,879 --> 01:02:31,779
- Hey.
- Hey.

643
01:02:38,954 --> 01:02:41,866
He is not getting any better, is he?

644
01:02:44,681 --> 01:02:47,416
No, probably not.

645
01:02:49,283 --> 01:02:52,939
He's gonna love that thing...

646
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:58,940
his whole life and it's all my fault.

647
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:03,568
No, it's not, it's...

648
01:03:03,668 --> 01:03:06,020
I don't know.

649
01:03:06,121 --> 01:03:11,029
I mean, I left him as fast as I could.

650
01:03:14,988 --> 01:03:18,478
I never thought about him.
And then the two of us

651
01:03:18,579 --> 01:03:21,157
moved back here all fat and happy.

652
01:03:21,258 --> 01:03:26,150
And he moves into the goddamn garage
like a family dog.

653
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:30,471
And I let him.

654
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:36,151
No wonder he goes and orders a fiancé in a box.

655
01:03:39,848 --> 01:03:42,021
Come here.

656
01:04:40,607 --> 01:04:41,607
Hello?

657
01:04:50,207 --> 01:04:52,207
Bianca?

658
01:04:52,594 --> 01:04:55,037
We are upstairs.

659
01:05:00,193 --> 01:05:01,649
What's going on?

660
01:05:01,749 --> 01:05:03,749
There's a hospital volunteer banquet.

661
01:05:03,849 --> 01:05:05,849
- At the VFW.
- Doesn't she look beautiful?

662
01:05:05,949 --> 01:05:07,949
Oh, she does. She looks beautiful.

663
01:05:14,903 --> 01:05:17,644
We were supposed to play Scrabble.

664
01:05:17,745 --> 01:05:19,655
Are you sure?

665
01:05:19,756 --> 01:05:20,098
Yeah.

666
01:05:20,198 --> 01:05:23,429
Her schedule's on the refrigerator.
Did you check?

667
01:05:24,965 --> 01:05:27,897
No, I didn't.
I guess I've forgotten.

668
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:35,121
Can I have a moment alone with her, please?

669
01:05:39,205 --> 01:05:41,343
Thank you.

670
01:05:41,856 --> 01:05:43,466
Thank you.

671
01:05:49,736 --> 01:05:50,749
<i>You are my girlfriend. I shouldn't have to</i>

672
01:05:50,849 --> 01:05:52,031
check your schedule to see you.

673
01:05:52,631 --> 01:05:54,631
<i>When you make a plan, you make a plan.</i>

674
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:58,543
<i>You have ten people around you all the time...</i>

675
01:05:58,644 --> 01:06:00,882
<i>You can't have one of them to make a phone call
and let me know?</i>

676
01:06:00,982 --> 01:06:02,350
They never fight.

677
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:04,623
<i>I thought we were going to play Scrabble,
I get excited about playing Scrabble....</i>

678
01:06:04,724 --> 01:06:06,697
I don't like his tone.

679
01:06:12,729 --> 01:06:16,409
Now you listen to me.
Bianca has a life of her own.

680
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:19,335
No self-respecting woman is gonna be
at your beck and call, Mister.

681
01:06:19,435 --> 01:06:22,135
- And the sooner you learn that the better.
- Oh yeah?

682
01:06:22,236 --> 01:06:25,015
You're away to job all day.
What's she supposed to do?

683
01:06:25,115 --> 01:06:27,747
Wait for you?
Would you do that for her?

684
01:06:27,948 --> 01:06:30,105
Would she even ask you to?

685
01:06:30,205 --> 01:06:36,241
She is out in the community, doing things for others
less fortunate. You should be proud of her.

686
01:06:36,342 --> 01:06:39,674
- And what about me?
- Big baby,

687
01:06:39,774 --> 01:06:42,087
you are just like my husband.

688
01:06:42,187 --> 01:06:44,511
Should be home at eleven.

689
01:07:01,686 --> 01:07:05,107
Call it girlfriend. I shouldn't have to check
a schedule to see her.

690
01:07:09,408 --> 01:07:11,522
You okay?

691
01:07:13,003 --> 01:07:16,135
How would she feel if I just left her.

692
01:07:17,928 --> 01:07:20,087
Abandon her.

693
01:07:20,187 --> 01:07:22,762
Wait wait, she didn't abandon you,
she will be back.

694
01:07:24,054 --> 01:07:27,024
How do I know that?

695
01:07:27,951 --> 01:07:31,353
People do whatever they want.

696
01:07:32,164 --> 01:07:35,046
- They don't care.
- No, we all care.

697
01:07:35,146 --> 01:07:37,248
Lars, we do care.

698
01:07:38,662 --> 01:07:40,538
No, you don't.

699
01:07:40,926 --> 01:07:44,797
That is... that is just not true.

700
01:07:45,498 --> 01:07:46,498
God!

701
01:07:47,147 --> 01:07:53,462
Every person in this town bends all backwards
to make Bianca feel at home.

702
01:07:53,562 --> 01:07:57,446
Why... why do you think she has
so many places to go

703
01:07:57,547 --> 01:07:59,555
and so much to do, huh?

704
01:08:01,242 --> 01:08:03,905
- I don't know.
- Because of you.

705
01:08:04,006 --> 01:08:08,088
Because all these people love you.

706
01:08:08,389 --> 01:08:10,301
We push her wheelchair.

707
01:08:10,401 --> 01:08:13,336
We drive her to work,
We drive her home.

708
01:08:13,937 --> 01:08:16,528
We wash her, we dress her.

709
01:08:17,129 --> 01:08:19,818
We get her up, we put her to bed.

710
01:08:19,918 --> 01:08:21,918
We carry her.

711
01:08:22,018 --> 01:08:26,696
And she is not petite, Lars,
Bianca is a big big girl.

712
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:32,730
None of this is easy for any of us,
but we do it.

713
01:08:35,331 --> 01:08:37,713
We do it for you!

714
01:08:39,876 --> 01:08:44,656
So don't you dare tell me how we don't care.

715
01:08:58,395 --> 01:09:04,688
- I think it's the person's job who is upset to say...
- Umm... hey.

716
01:09:04,889 --> 01:09:06,983
- Oh hey.
- Hey.

717
01:09:07,082 --> 01:09:09,000
How was the game?

718
01:09:10,819 --> 01:09:13,566
The cheese inspectors beat
the crap out of us.

719
01:09:14,267 --> 01:09:17,443
Is everything alright?
I mean, I usually put Bianca to bed.

720
01:09:17,644 --> 01:09:21,444
Yeah, you know.
Umm... okay.

721
01:09:21,711 --> 01:09:25,883
Tell him...
Well, we wanted to talk to you about that.

722
01:09:30,471 --> 01:09:33,323
You don't have to do that anymore.
I'm gonna do that.

723
01:09:33,624 --> 01:09:37,389
You sure? Because I don't...
I don't mind, I thought that you...

724
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:38,890
Sorry.

725
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:45,331
- It's just been one of these days.
- It's... it's fine.

726
01:09:46,118 --> 01:09:48,469
It's up to you, and...
Good.

727
01:09:49,753 --> 01:09:54,180
- But I'll better leave you guys.
- Hey Gus.

728
01:09:54,632 --> 01:09:57,233
- What's that?
- Thank you though.

729
01:09:58,150 --> 01:10:01,092
- I didn't do anything.
- Yeah, you did.

730
01:10:08,907 --> 01:10:11,250
I'm tired.

731
01:10:17,975 --> 01:10:20,857
- Did I miss something?
- We had a big fight.

732
01:10:20,956 --> 01:10:22,763
- Really?
- Yes.

733
01:10:44,482 --> 01:10:47,802
- Lars, have you met Erik?
- Not officially.

734
01:10:48,379 --> 01:10:49,762
You're pretty famous around here.

735
01:10:51,512 --> 01:10:52,212
Well...

736
01:10:54,212 --> 01:10:56,212
Healthy grip too, pal.

737
01:11:26,947 --> 01:11:28,971
Yes?

738
01:11:41,332 --> 01:11:43,694
In my office.

739
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:46,962
I think I'm gonna stay.

740
01:11:47,061 --> 01:11:49,845
She's feeling pretty lousy today.

741
01:11:51,445 --> 01:11:52,745
We'll both stay.

742
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:05,231
I asked her to marry me last week.

743
01:12:09,486 --> 01:12:12,109
Congratulations.

744
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:15,493
When's the happy day?

745
01:12:15,592 --> 01:12:20,834
- She said no.
- Oh. Oh no.

746
01:12:20,933 --> 01:12:23,058
- Yeah, I know. I couldn't believe it.

747
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:26,299
- Yeah...

748
01:12:34,693 --> 01:12:39,811
<i>Stop it. You have no right to talk to me
like that. No, you don't.</i>

749
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:43,277
<i>No, you don't. I don't talk to you like that.</i>

750
01:12:57,823 --> 01:12:59,813
Could you stop yelling?

751
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:41,910
I was talking to Bianca, and...

752
01:13:42,009 --> 01:13:45,519
she was saying that in her culture,
they have these rites of passages and...

753
01:13:45,618 --> 01:13:48,675
rituals and ceremonies, and...

754
01:13:48,776 --> 01:13:51,232
this whole kind of things, you know,
that when you do them,

755
01:13:51,331 --> 01:13:53,013
or at least when you're done,
if you live through them

756
01:13:53,113 --> 01:13:54,556
that you know you're an adult.

757
01:13:56,470 --> 01:13:58,802
Doesn't that sound great?

758
01:13:59,103 --> 01:14:00,999
It does.

759
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,195
How do you know?

760
01:14:03,396 --> 01:14:05,085
How do I know what?

761
01:14:05,184 --> 01:14:07,364
That you are a man?

762
01:14:09,281 --> 01:14:11,703
Nah, I couldn't tell you.

763
01:14:15,766 --> 01:14:18,511
Okay, was it sex?

764
01:14:25,564 --> 01:14:30,414
Yeah, you know, yeah, yeah.
It's a... yeah, kind of...no.

765
01:14:30,615 --> 01:14:31,639
Well it's a kind of sex,

766
01:14:31,738 --> 01:14:34,026
but it's not... it's not... umm, you know...

767
01:14:34,678 --> 01:14:37,836
I... I don't know,
I don't know, it's a...

768
01:14:37,935 --> 01:14:40,124
good... good question.

769
01:14:40,223 --> 01:14:42,490
Yeah, but I have to know.

770
01:14:43,262 --> 01:14:45,506
Hold that thought.

771
01:14:56,784 --> 01:14:58,437
You know you should ask Dagmar.

772
01:14:58,536 --> 01:15:01,773
I did ask Dagmar.
She said that I should ask you.

773
01:15:05,288 --> 01:15:08,767
- You know I... I can only give you my opinion.
- That's all I want.

774
01:15:08,866 --> 01:15:11,397
Well, it's not like you are
one thing or the other, okay?

775
01:15:11,498 --> 01:15:14,246
There's still a kid inside
but you... you grow up...

776
01:15:14,345 --> 01:15:16,155
when you decide to do right? Okay?

777
01:15:16,255 --> 01:15:18,455
And not what's right for you,
what's right for everyone.

778
01:15:18,554 --> 01:15:21,308
Even when it hurts.

779
01:15:23,222 --> 01:15:25,185
Okay...
Like what?

780
01:15:27,425 --> 01:15:29,881
Like...

781
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:32,309
You know, like: you don't jerk people around, you know

782
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:35,806
and... and you don't cheat on your woman

783
01:15:35,905 --> 01:15:39,321
and you take care your family,
you know, you admit when you're wrong.

784
01:15:39,422 --> 01:15:41,670
Or you try to anyways.

785
01:15:43,134 --> 01:15:45,831
That's all I can think of, you know?

786
01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:48,248
It sounds like it's easy,
but for some reasons, it's not.

787
01:15:48,348 --> 01:15:50,355
I know. Because nothing is easy.

788
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:54,158
It's like the old man, he didn't have
to take care of two kids alone.

789
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:57,339
He could have given us to an orphanage
or something, you know. People do that.

790
01:15:57,438 --> 01:15:59,369
But he loved us, and he
tried to do right,

791
01:15:59,468 --> 01:16:01,175
even though he didn't know how,

792
01:16:01,275 --> 01:16:04,243
and even though he had a broken heart.

793
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:16,397
I shouldn't have left you alone with him.

794
01:16:16,496 --> 01:16:19,048
He was too sad, it scared me...

795
01:16:19,147 --> 01:16:20,864
And I just...

796
01:16:21,365 --> 01:16:23,365
I just ran,

797
01:16:26,259 --> 01:16:28,579
and that was selfish

798
01:16:29,916 --> 01:16:32,140
and I'm sorry.

799
01:16:36,757 --> 01:16:38,011
That's okay.

800
01:16:42,011 --> 01:16:43,211
Okay.

801
01:16:48,698 --> 01:16:50,813
You've crossed the line.

802
01:16:50,912 --> 01:16:54,971
- Well you kept swiping my action figures.
- I hide them, I don't hang them.

803
01:16:55,071 --> 01:16:58,435
Well, whatever, Margo, you're
too old for that thing anyway, okay?

804
01:16:58,970 --> 01:17:00,317
- Take off the news.
- No.

805
01:17:00,416 --> 01:17:02,167
- No.
- Take it off.

806
01:17:02,357 --> 01:17:06,429
Face it, Margo, the bear is dead, okay?
Burn on you.

807
01:17:13,458 --> 01:17:15,571
I warned her.

808
01:17:32,986 --> 01:17:35,529
It's not just the bear.

809
01:17:35,629 --> 01:17:38,528
I broke up with Erik.

810
01:17:46,196 --> 01:17:48,107
I'm sorry to hear that.

811
01:17:49,778 --> 01:17:52,578
Yeah, you know, I didn't even have a good reason.

812
01:17:52,677 --> 01:17:55,134
At least one that's very interesting.

813
01:18:05,601 --> 01:18:07,945
Why was he your boyfriend?

814
01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:13,554
Because I was lonely.

815
01:18:15,755 --> 01:18:17,555
Oh yeah?

816
01:18:36,221 --> 01:18:38,136
Thank you.

817
01:18:38,614 --> 01:18:40,398
Sure.

818
01:18:43,563 --> 01:18:46,604
What are you doing on Friday night?

819
01:18:50,037 --> 01:18:51,965
School board meeting.

820
01:18:53,461 --> 01:18:55,594
Bianca got elected so...

821
01:18:56,195 --> 01:18:59,328
- That's great.
- Yeah.

822
01:19:06,269 --> 01:19:07,903
Why?

823
01:19:08,822 --> 01:19:12,991
I was just thinking that maybe
we could all go out... sometime.

824
01:19:15,325 --> 01:19:17,109
Never mind.

825
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:19,817
After I drop off Bianca,
I'm free.

826
01:19:19,916 --> 01:19:22,596
But it's just me, so...

827
01:19:26,890 --> 01:19:29,045
That would be great, Lars.

828
01:19:30,206 --> 01:19:32,001
Thank you.

829
01:19:58,973 --> 01:20:00,703
Nice shot.

830
01:20:25,579 --> 01:20:30,082
- You've pretty too much spin on the ball.
- I know.

831
01:20:36,299 --> 01:20:38,638
- Sorry, we're full up.
- Next thing is a lady tournament.

832
01:20:39,138 --> 01:20:41,138
No way, dude.
Let them lady go.

833
01:20:41,735 --> 01:20:44,318
You know aint nothing.
No shreddin' me.

834
01:20:45,197 --> 01:20:47,077
Is that Lars?

835
01:20:48,922 --> 01:20:51,994
- Hey, buddy.
- We're full.

836
01:20:52,094 --> 01:20:53,094
No ploblema.

837
01:20:57,632 --> 01:21:01,721
- Margo, kick your butt.
- No, Nelson. I'll kick your butt.

838
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:08,308
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

839
01:21:15,208 --> 01:21:17,208
Hey baby you're bowling on my life.

840
01:22:25,739 --> 01:22:28,300
This is exactly what I needed.

841
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:31,662
Things look so much better.

842
01:22:32,266 --> 01:22:35,838
Hey, thanks for going bowling with me, Lars.

843
01:22:55,798 --> 01:22:58,992
I don't wanna give you the wrong idea

844
01:22:59,393 --> 01:23:01,548
about this.

845
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:09,234
I never could cheat on Bianca.
Ever.

846
01:23:10,468 --> 01:23:16,063
No. Oh my God, I hope you didn't think that, Lars.

847
01:23:16,162 --> 01:23:18,422
I would never do that.

848
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:30,544
I would never do that.

849
01:23:34,232 --> 01:23:36,008
Okay, good.

850
01:23:36,107 --> 01:23:37,358
Yeah. Me neither.

851
01:23:38,163 --> 01:23:41,454
'Cos a man doesn't cheat on his woman,
that's a...

852
01:23:41,855 --> 01:23:44,352
Absolutely...
and vice versa.

853
01:23:45,215 --> 01:23:49,554
Besides, I don't mean to steal anybody's boyfriend.

854
01:23:49,955 --> 01:23:52,477
ONe day I'll find a man of my own and...

855
01:23:54,267 --> 01:23:56,291
We'll be happy too.

856
01:23:58,725 --> 01:24:01,858
Yeah, that's the way it works, I guess.

857
01:24:19,658 --> 01:24:21,933
Thanks.

858
01:24:24,770 --> 01:24:26,914
Snow.

859
01:24:32,439 --> 01:24:35,711
I was hoping that winter was over.

860
01:24:35,811 --> 01:24:37,218
No, that's just a thaw.

861
01:24:38,268 --> 01:24:40,111
Winter isn't over till Easter.

862
01:24:47,687 --> 01:24:50,096
Thanks again.

863
01:25:18,878 --> 01:25:21,683
Good night, Lars.

864
01:25:39,808 --> 01:25:42,588
I'm not sure how well these treatments are working.

865
01:25:42,687 --> 01:25:45,156
No?

866
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,964
What do you think?

867
01:25:52,201 --> 01:25:54,401
I don't know.

868
01:26:00,834 --> 01:26:03,235
I'm sorry.

869
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:15,741
I don't know, it's hard.
It's hard because...

870
01:26:17,514 --> 01:26:23,310
I know that she loves me. But I ask
her to marry me, and she says no.

871
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:28,442
She says, I don't know.

872
01:26:30,777 --> 01:26:33,127
Or she doesn't say anything.

873
01:26:38,044 --> 01:26:40,173
Nothing?

874
01:26:47,379 --> 01:26:51,548
<i>When I was a child,
I'd speak as a child.</i>

875
01:26:51,647 --> 01:26:54,757
<i>I understood as a child.</i>

876
01:27:18,652 --> 01:27:20,811
Does that feel good?

877
01:27:57,972 --> 01:28:01,851
Wake up!
Wake up!

878
01:28:05,511 --> 01:28:07,469
She won't wake up.

879
01:28:07,569 --> 01:28:09,727
Bianca. I think she's unconscious, hey.

880
01:28:09,826 --> 01:28:11,928
- Are you sure?
- Look at me, Bianca.

881
01:28:12,028 --> 01:28:15,078
Hey, hey hey hey hey.

882
01:28:15,215 --> 01:28:18,556
- Bianca is unconscious.
- Can you hear me? Bianca.

883
01:28:22,031 --> 01:28:23,847
Wake up.

884
01:28:23,946 --> 01:28:26,859
She looks alright, she looks alright.
She looks alright... hey hey hey hey.

885
01:28:26,958 --> 01:28:29,471
- Call 911.
- Okay, okay.

886
01:28:32,710 --> 01:28:34,210
911?

887
01:28:34,411 --> 01:28:36,253
Well, I don't know.
Why do you always expect

888
01:28:36,402 --> 01:28:37,346
me to know what to do?

889
01:28:47,026 --> 01:28:49,620
They are there, call Dr. Birnman.

890
01:28:51,921 --> 01:28:53,487
# O is for the only one I see #

891
01:28:54,237 --> 01:28:57,821
# V is very very extraordinary #

892
01:28:57,921 --> 01:29:01,421
# E is even more than anyone
that you adore #

893
01:29:01,537 --> 01:29:03,801
I'm sorry, you'll have to wait out here.

894
01:29:03,901 --> 01:29:05,901
# Love is all that I can give to you...#

895
01:29:07,386 --> 01:29:08,866
Doctor's on the way.

896
01:29:09,867 --> 01:29:14,867
- Hello? Hello?
- Lars, Lars.

897
01:29:24,977 --> 01:29:26,672
What?

898
01:29:29,348 --> 01:29:31,354
What?

899
01:29:31,977 --> 01:29:34,710
Bianca is very sick.

900
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:39,222
No, she's not, she's not.
C'mon, she's not sick.

901
01:29:39,321 --> 01:29:41,651
She's not, Lars.

902
01:29:44,186 --> 01:29:46,400
She's dying.

903
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,500
- But...?
- Oh God.

904
01:29:49,249 --> 01:29:52,402
We're gonna keep her here until
she's stable, but...

905
01:29:52,501 --> 01:29:55,279
she wants to go home with Lars tonight.

906
01:29:55,378 --> 01:29:58,375
- Can I see her?
- Sure.

907
01:30:21,638 --> 01:30:23,401
What?

908
01:30:43,418 --> 01:30:46,587
I'm sorry, but I...
I just don't get it. I don't.

909
01:30:46,788 --> 01:30:51,026
I mean, what's that gonna do to him?
How could you let this happen?

910
01:30:51,125 --> 01:30:55,449
No, I'm not letting it happen, it's Lars.
It's always been Lars.

911
01:30:56,559 --> 01:31:01,175
He's making the decisions.
He's the one who found her unconscious.

912
01:31:01,275 --> 01:31:03,726
He's the one who said she's dying.

913
01:31:16,850 --> 01:31:19,064
You okay back there?

914
01:31:19,163 --> 01:31:22,504
They gave her something, so she's asleep.

915
01:31:23,612 --> 01:31:26,335
Anything you want, Lars?

916
01:31:31,028 --> 01:31:34,759
I want to stay together with her
in the pink room tonight.

917
01:33:20,694 --> 01:33:25,909
Come down to the family room, Lars.
Let Bianca rest.

918
01:33:34,407 --> 01:33:37,567
We sent Gus and Karin to the movies.

919
01:33:37,968 --> 01:33:41,056
They didn't want to leave you too.

920
01:33:48,424 --> 01:33:50,093
I'm glad they left.

921
01:33:50,193 --> 01:33:53,942
I feel terrible with all this is happening
so close to the baby coming.

922
01:33:54,041 --> 01:33:57,678
This how life is, Lars.
Everything at once.

923
01:33:57,778 --> 01:33:59,778
We brought casseroles.

924
01:34:00,878 --> 01:34:01,878
Thank you.

925
01:34:10,830 --> 01:34:13,004
Is there something I should
be doing right now?

926
01:34:13,153 --> 01:34:13,847
No, dear.

927
01:34:14,846 --> 01:34:16,948
You eat.

928
01:34:17,048 --> 01:34:19,479
We came over to sit.

929
01:34:19,578 --> 01:34:22,064
That's what people do when tragedy strikes.

930
01:34:22,163 --> 01:34:24,833
They come over and sit.

931
01:34:30,074 --> 01:34:32,627
Don't you feel a little better?

932
01:34:51,644 --> 01:34:54,445
I got spring fever. We're going to the lake.

933
01:34:54,595 --> 01:34:55,670
You wanna come?

934
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:05,892
Hey Lars, why don't you come with us?

935
01:35:06,842 --> 01:35:08,641
It'll do everybody good.

936
01:35:16,284 --> 01:35:21,408
Bianca, don't you want to see
this beautiful day?

937
01:35:34,543 --> 01:35:38,714
- Is there a storm coming?
- The weather said no.

938
01:35:42,089 --> 01:35:44,411
It looks like a storm to me.

939
01:35:45,512 --> 01:35:50,577
Well, I need to stretch my legs.
Let's take a chance.

940
01:35:56,220 --> 01:35:57,720
Lars.

941
01:36:00,721 --> 01:36:03,719
I think we're gonna watch the water.

942
01:36:03,993 --> 01:36:05,763
Well, we won't be far.

943
01:36:06,668 --> 01:36:09,333
- Holler if you need us.
- Okay.

944
01:37:57,872 --> 01:37:59,403
So you think it's not the right color?

945
01:37:59,453 --> 01:38:01,153
I don't know. Does it match the curtains?

946
01:38:02,003 --> 01:38:05,829
- I think so, here, just be careful.
- Okay.

947
01:38:18,295 --> 01:38:21,319
No no, don't run.
Lars.

948
01:38:23,020 --> 01:38:24,320
Lars!

949
01:38:49,710 --> 01:38:53,321
Lars asked us not to wear black today.

950
01:38:53,922 --> 01:39:00,349
He did so to remind us that this
is no ordinary funeral.

951
01:39:02,713 --> 01:39:07,580
We are here to celebrate Bianca's
extraordinary life.

952
01:39:09,729 --> 01:39:15,064
From her wheelchair, Bianca
reached out and touched us all

953
01:39:15,465 --> 01:39:19,645
in ways we could have never imagined.

954
01:39:21,167 --> 01:39:23,569
She was a teacher.

955
01:39:25,705 --> 01:39:29,403
She was a lesson in courage.

956
01:39:34,027 --> 01:39:36,449
And Bianca loved us all.

957
01:39:37,664 --> 01:39:40,283
Especially Lars.

958
01:39:42,621 --> 01:39:44,875
Especially him.

959
01:40:31,718 --> 01:40:35,607
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm sorry, I just...

960
01:40:36,308 --> 01:40:41,677
I don't know... it's just...
funerals and mom and dad, you know.

961
01:40:48,827 --> 01:40:52,975
- He's unbelievable.
- Yes.

962
01:40:57,552 --> 01:41:02,454
I wanted to thank you for...

963
01:41:10,855 --> 01:41:12,455
Gus.

964
01:41:19,485 --> 01:41:23,173
- So shall we see you in the house?
- Of course.

965
01:41:23,374 --> 01:41:24,374
Sure.

966
01:41:54,330 --> 01:41:57,541
She asked me not to be sad
but I can't help it.

967
01:42:01,001 --> 01:42:03,567
Yeah, me neither.

968
01:42:05,909 --> 01:42:08,979
But it'll all get better with time.

969
01:42:10,933 --> 01:42:13,494
That's what everyone keeps saying, so...

970
01:42:14,952 --> 01:42:18,751
It's true, I think, in a way.

971
01:42:22,836 --> 01:42:26,619
But there'll never be anybody like her.

972
01:42:48,689 --> 01:42:52,208
I suppose we should...

973
01:42:52,307 --> 01:42:55,533
catch up with everyone.

974
01:43:01,650 --> 01:43:04,511
Would you want to take a walk?

975
01:43:05,954 --> 01:43:07,708
Yes.

976
01:43:15,308 --> 01:43:16,908
