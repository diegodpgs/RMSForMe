<i>Bio-readouts are all in the green.
Looks like she's alive.</i>

3
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,597
Well, there goes our salvage, guys.

4
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,431
How are we today?

5
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,158
Terrible.

6
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,800
Well, better than yesterday, at least.

7
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,030
- Where am I?
- You're safe.

8
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,120
You're at Gateway Station.
Been here a couple of days.

9
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,919
You were pretty groggy at first,
but now you're OK.

10
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,875
Looks like you've got a visitor.

11
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,795
Jonesy! Come here!

12
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,558
Hey, come here!

13
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,911
How are you, you stupid cat?

14
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,319
How are you!

15
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,033
Where have you been?

16
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,990
Guess you two have met, huh?

17
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,198
I'm Burke. Carter Burke.
I work for the company.

18
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,313
But... don't let that fool you.
I'm really an OK guy.

19
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,390
I'm glad to see you're feeling better.

20
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,314
They say that all the weakness
and disorientation should pass soon.

21
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,679
That's just natural side effects of such
a long hypersleep. Or something like that.

22
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,191
What do you mean?

23
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,191
How long was I out there?

24
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,474
Has no-one discussed this with you yet?

25
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,949
No. But, I mean, I don't...

26
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,916
...recognise this place.

27
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,954
No, I know. Uh... OK.

28
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,077
It's just that, uh,
this might be a shock to you.

29
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,549
- It's longer...
- How long?

30
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,709
Please.

31
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,998
57 years.

32
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,515
What?

33
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,837
That's the thing.
You were out there for 57 years.

34
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,637
You had drifted
right through the core systems.

35
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,154
And it's really just blind luck...

36
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,550
...that a deep-salvage team
found you when they did.

37
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,631
It's one in a thousand, really.

38
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,950
You're damn lucky to be alive, kiddo.

39
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,634
You could be floating out there forever.

40
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,590
You OK?

41
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,079
Uh...

42
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,434
Oh!

43
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,748
You OK?

44
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,709
Oh!

45
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,669
God!

46
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,159
Nurse! Please!

47
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,158
Someone get in here now!

48
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,673
<i>No!</i>

49
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,399
Now!

50
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,629
Hold!

51
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,596
Please!

52
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,830
Hold her!

53
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,795
Kill me!

54
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,913
No!

55
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,558
No!

56
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,911
<i>Bad dreams again?</i>

57
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,992
<i>- You want something to help you sleep?
- No.</i>

58
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,752
I've slept enough.

59
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,472
Jonesy... come here.

60
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,598
Shh!

61
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,472
It's all right.

62
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,711
It's all right now.

63
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,192
It's over.

64
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,073
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
Been running behind all morning.

65
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,833
Is there any word about my daughter?

66
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,469
Uh... I think we should worry
about the hearing now.

67
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,551
I read your deposition...

68
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,393
...and it's great.
If you stick to that, we'll be fine.

69
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,313
There are gonna be
a lot of heavyweights in there.

70
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,470
Feds, Interstellar Commerce Commission...

71
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,597
...Colonial Administration,
insurance company guys.

72
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,069
Do you have any news about my daughter?

73
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,558
Well, we did come up with some information.
Why don't we sit down?

74
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,359
I was hoping to wait until after the inquest.

75
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,759
Uh...

76
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,393
Amanda Ripley McClaren...
Her married name, I guess?

77
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,152
Age 66.

78
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,835
And that was at the time of her death...

79
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,709
...which was two years ago.

80
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,109
I'm real sorry.

81
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,829
Amy...

82
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,951
She was cremated...

83
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,510
...and interred at Westlake Repository,
in Wisconsin.

84
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,591
No children mentioned.

85
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,196
I promised her...

86
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,918
...that I would be home for her birthday.

87
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,635
Her eleventh birthday.

88
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,834
Ohh...

89
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,239
<i>They'd like to go back to this
point about the override destruct order.</i>

90
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,511
I don't understand this.

91
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,479
We have been here for three and a half hours.

92
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,552
How many different ways
do you want the same story?

93
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,030
Look at it from our perspective, please.

94
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,872
Please?

95
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,673
You admit to detonating the engines of, and
thereby destroying, an M-Class star freighter.

96
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,955
An expensive piece of hardware.

97
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,873
<i>42 million in adjusted dollars.</i>

98
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,315
That's minus payload, of course.

99
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,474
The lifeboat's flight recorder corroborates
some elements of your account.

100
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,395
In that, for reasons unknown,
the Nostromo set down on LV-426...

101
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,119
...an unsurveyed planet at that time.

102
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,910
That it resumed its course, and was
subsequently set for self-destruct by you...

103
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,353
...for reasons unknown.

104
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,510
Not for reasons unknown. I told you.

105
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:40,391
We set down there on company orders
to get this thing, which destroyed my crew...

106
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,755
...and your expensive ship.

107
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:48,472
The analysis team found no physical
evidence of the creature you describe.

108
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,152
Good!

109
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,630
That's because I blew it out
of the goddamn air lock.

110
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,473
Like I said.

111
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,155
Are there any species like
this hostile organism on LV-426?

112
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,549
No. It's a rock. No indigenous life.

113
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,996
Did IQ's just drop sharply while I was away?

114
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,995
Ma'am, I already said it was not indigenous.
It was a derelict spacecraft. An alien ship.

115
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,593
It was not from there.

116
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,478
Do you get it? We homed in on its beacon.

117
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,032
And found something never recorded once
in over 300 surveyed worlds.

118
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,637
A creature that "gestates...

119
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,359
...inside a living human host".
- Yes.

120
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,793
These are your words.

121
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,190
- "And has concentrated acid for blood."
- That's right.

122
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,236
Look, I can see where this is going,
but I'm telling you that...

123
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,471
...those things exist.
- Thank you, Officer. That will be all.

124
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,358
Please! You're not listening.
Kane - the crew member...

125
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,991
Kane, who went into that ship, said
he saw thousands of eggs. Thousands.

126
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,036
Thank you. That will be all.

127
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,750
<i>Goddamn it, that's not all! If one of those
things gets down here, that will be all!</i>

128
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:05,312
Then all this bullshit that you think is so
important... you can kiss all that goodbye!

129
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,718
It is the finding
of this court of inquiry that...

130
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,791
...Warrant Officer E Ripley...

131
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,758
...NOC 14472...

132
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,513
...has acted with questionable judgment...

133
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,832
...and is unfit to hold an ICC licence
as a commercial flight officer.

134
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,791
Said licence is hereby suspended indefinitely.

135
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,680
No criminal charges will be filed against
you at this time, and you are released...

136
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,719
...on your own recognisance for a six-month
period of psychometric probation...

137
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,078
...to include monthly review
by an ICC psychiatric technician.

138
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,551
These proceedings are closed.

139
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,911
That could have been... better.

140
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,753
- Look, I think... Ripley?
- Van Leuwen.

141
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,840
Why don't you just check out LV-426?

142
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,951
Because I don't have to.

143
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,431
The people there have never complained
about any hostile organism.

144
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,034
What do you mean? What people?

145
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,473
Terraformers.

146
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,312
Planet engineers.

147
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,428
They set up atmosphere processors
to make the air breathable. Takes decades.

148
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,239
It's what we call a Shake 'n' Bake colony.

149
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,835
How many are there? How many colonists?

150
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,758
I don't know. 60, maybe 70, families.

151
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,239
Do you mind?

152
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,631
Families.

153
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,519
Jesus!

154
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,474
I'll be down in maintenance, OK?

155
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,676
- Al?
- What?

156
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,159
- Hey, Al.
- What?

157
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,074
Remember you sent some wildcatters
out past the alien range last week?

158
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,149
Yeah.

159
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,231
One of them's on the horn.

160
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,835
Says he's on to something.
Wants to know if his claim will be honoured.

161
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,195
Why wouldn't his claim be honoured?

162
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,670
Because you sent them
on company orders, maybe?

163
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,231
Christ! Some honch in a cushy office on
Earth says "Go look at a grid reference".

164
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,312
We look. They don't say why and I don't ask.

165
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,676
I don't ask because it takes two weeks
to get an answer out here.

166
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,830
And the answer is always "Don't ask".

167
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,911
So what do I tell this guy?

168
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,709
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned,
if he finds something, it is his.

169
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,791
- Lydecker?
- What?

170
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,395
You kids are not supposed
to be on this level! Get out of here!

171
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,075
<i>You go in places we can't fit!</i>

172
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,913
So? That's why I'm the best!

173
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,676
Knock it off! If I catch you playing
in the air ducts again, I'll tan your hides.

174
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,716
Mom, all the kids play...

175
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,268
Annie, come and have
a look at this, will ya?

176
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,393
Folks, we have scored big this time.

177
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,992
What is it, Dad?

178
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,953
I'm not sure.

179
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,551
Let's see if we can't get
a closer look at this thing.

180
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,077
<i>- Shouldn't we call in?
- Let's wait till we know what to call it in as.</i>

181
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,955
That's about as close as we can get.

182
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,191
Should we take a look inside?

183
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,236
You kids stay inside. I mean it.
We'll be right back.

184
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,072
- OK.
- Bye.

185
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,479
Timmy, they've been gone a long time.

186
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,393
It'll be OK. Dad knows what he's doing.

187
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,755
Mayday! Mayday! This is Alpha Kilo
Two Four Niner calling Alpha Control!

188
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,718
This is Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner!

189
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,639
Hi, Ripley. This is Lieutenant Gorman
of the Colonial Marine Corps...

190
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,071
Ripley, we have to talk.

191
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,916
We've lost contact with the colony on LV-426.

192
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,151
I don't believe this.

193
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,310
You guys throw me to the wolves...

194
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,868
...and now you want me to go back out there?

195
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,349
Forget it. It's not my problem.

196
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,793
- Can I finish?
- No.

197
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,871
There's no way.

198
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,277
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.
I can guarantee your safety.

199
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,912
These Colonial Marines are tough hombres.
They're packing state-of-the-art firepower.

200
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,230
There's nothing they can't handle.

201
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,435
Am I right?

202
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,990
We've been trained to deal
with situations like this.

203
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,640
Then you don't need me. I'm not a soldier.

204
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,598
We don't know what's going on out there.
It may just be a downed transmitter.

205
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,671
But if it's not...

206
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,829
...I would like you there as an advisor,
and that's all.

207
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,636
What's your interest in all this?
Why are you going?

208
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,635
The corporation co-financed that colony
along with Colonial Administration.

209
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,871
We're doing a lot of terraforming,
building better worlds...

210
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,110
Yeah. I saw the commercial.

211
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,237
Look, I don't have time for this.
I've got to get to work.

212
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,357
Oh, right.
I heard you're working the cargo docks.

213
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,078
That's right.

214
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,879
- Running loaders and forklifts.
- Yeah. So?

215
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,191
Nothing. I think it's great
that you're keeping busy.

216
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,638
And I know it's the only thing that you
could get. There's nothing wrong with it.

217
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,350
What would you say if I told you
I could get you reinstated as a flight officer?

218
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,796
The company's already agreed
to pick up your contract.

219
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,313
If I go.

220
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,473
If you go.

221
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,791
Come on, that's a second chance, kiddo.

222
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,793
Get out there and face this thing.
Get back on the horse.

223
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,838
Spare me, Burke.
I've had my psych evaluation this month.

224
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,718
Yeah, I know. I've read it.
You wake up every night...

225
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,110
...soaked in sweat...
- I said no! And I mean it!

226
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,311
Now please leave.

227
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,791
I am not going back! And I am...
I would not be any good to you if I did.

228
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,915
OK.

229
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,035
Shh.

230
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,596
Would you do me a favour?
Just think about it.

231
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,151
Thanks for the coffee.

232
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,479
Aagh!

233
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,719
Ohh!

234
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,717
<i>Hello.</i>

235
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,071
<i>Ripley? You OK?</i>

236
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,799
Just tell me one thing, Burke.

237
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,838
You're going out there to destroy them, right?

238
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,399
Not to study.

239
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,118
Not to bring back.

240
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,872
But to wipe them out.

241
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,838
<i>That's the plan. You have my word on it.</i>

242
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,117
All right, I'm in.

243
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,154
And you, you little shithead...

244
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,231
...you're staying here.

245
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,231
They ain't payin' us enough for this, man.

246
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,837
<i>Not enough to have to
wake up to your face, Drake.</i>

247
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,909
What?

248
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,356
- Is that ajoke?
- Oh, I wish it were!

249
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,195
Hey, Hicks. Man, you lookjust like I feel.

250
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,675
All right, sweethearts,
what are you waiting for? Breakfast in bed?

251
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,035
Another glorious day in the Corps!

252
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,634
A day in the Marine Corps
is like a day on the farm.

253
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,030
Every meal's a banquet,
every paycheck a fortune.

254
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,678
Every formation a parade.

255
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,079
<i>I love the Corps!</i>

256
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,919
Man, this floor is freezing!

257
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,037
- You want me to fetch your slippers?
- Gee, would you, sir?

258
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,997
Look into my eye.

259
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,195
Fall in, people!

260
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,589
Come on, let's go.

261
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,432
I hate this job.

262
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,398
<i>Crowe! Wierzbowski! On your feet!</i>

263
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,356
<i>I'm talking about breathing,
not this frozen shit.</i>

264
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,874
<i>Yeah, Top, how about it?</i>

265
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,593
<i>All right, first assembly's
in 15, people. Shag it!</i>

266
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,280
<i>Hey, mira. Who's Snow White?</i>

267
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,750
She's supposed to be
some kind of consultant.

268
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,115
Apparently, she saw an alien once.

269
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,919
Whoopee-fucking-doo!
Hey, I'm impressed.

270
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,479
<i>¡Qué bonita!</i>

271
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,151
Hey, Vasquez.

272
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,357
Have you ever been mistaken for a man?

273
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,192
No. Have you?

274
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,077
Oh, Vasquez!

275
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,951
You're just too bad.

276
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,311
Hey, Top, what's the op?

277
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,868
It's a rescue mission. You'll love it.

278
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,511
There's some juicy colonists' daughters
we have to rescue from their virginity.

279
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,073
<i>Dumb-ass colonists!</i>

280
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,555
What's this crap supposed to be?

281
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,552
- Cornbread, I think.
- It's good for you, boy. Eat it.

282
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,839
I sure wouldn't mind getting more of that
Arcturian poontang. Remember that time?

283
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:41,278
- But the one that you had was male!
- Doesn't matter when it's Arcturian, baby!

284
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,318
- Hey, Bishop. Do the thing with the knife.
- Oh, please...

285
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,035
All right!

286
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,714
<i>I don't wanna see that, man.</i>

287
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,597
<i>Come on, man. All right!</i>

288
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,513
Hey, what are you doing, man?
What are you doing?

289
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,636
- Don't move.
- Quit messing, Drake!

290
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,199
Bishop! Hey, man!

291
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,510
- Do it, Bishop.
- Hey, not me, man!

292
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,716
Yeah, you. Don't move.

293
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,028
Trust me.

294
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:12,236
Aaaaggghhhhhh!

295
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,075
<i>All right, knock it off.</i>

296
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,070
Thank you.

297
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,352
Enjoy your meal.

298
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,079
That wasn't funny, man.

299
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,512
- Lieutenant Gorman?
- No.

300
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,477
- Mr Burke?
- Yeah, thanks.

301
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:39,429
Looks like the new lieutenant's too good
to eat with the rest of us grunts.

302
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,958
The boy's definitely
got a corncob up his ass.

303
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,673
I thought you never missed, Bishop.

304
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,432
You never said an android
was on board. Why not?

305
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,314
It never occurred to me.

306
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,278
It's common practice
to have a synthetic on board.

307
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,874
I prefer the term "artificial person" myself.

308
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,709
Right.

309
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,360
- Is there a problem?
- I'm sorry.

310
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,638
I didn't even... Ripley's last trip, the syn...
The artificial person...

311
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,870
...malfunctioned.
- Malfunctioned?

312
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,396
There were problems and...
a few deaths were involved.

313
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,552
I'm shocked.
Was it an older model?

314
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,200
Yeah. The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A-2.

315
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,510
The A-2s always were a bit twitchy.

316
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,797
That could never happen now
with our behavioural inhibitors.

317
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,919
It is impossible for me to harm,
or allow to be harmed, a human being.

318
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,991
You sure you don't want some?

319
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,634
Just stay away from me, Bishop.

320
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,477
Guess she don't like the cornbread, either.

321
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,398
<i>Squad! Atten-hut! Officer on deck!</i>

322
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,232
<i>As you were.</i>

323
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,788
Quickly, quickly. Settle down.

324
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,598
All right, listen up!

325
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,955
Morning, Marines. I'm sorry we didn't have
time to brief you before we left Gateway...

326
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,395
- Sir?
- What is it, Hicks?

327
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,472
<i>Hudson, sir. He's Hicks.</i>

328
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,312
What's the question?

329
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,029
Is this gonna be a stand-up fight, sir,
or another bug hunt?

330
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,033
All we know is there's still
no contact with the colony...

331
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,873
...and a xenomorph may be involved.

332
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,758
- Excuse me, sir. A what?
- A xenomorph.

333
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,515
It's a bug hunt.
What exactly are we dealing with here?

334
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,832
Ripley?

335
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,391
I'll tell you what I know.

336
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,195
We set down on LV-426.

337
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,114
A crew member was brought back
with something attached to his face...

338
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,191
...some kind of parasite.

339
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,919
We tried to get it off. It wouldn't come off.

340
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,798
Later, it seemed to come off by itself and die.

341
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,996
Kane seemed fine.

342
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,196
We were all having dinner.

343
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,512
It must have laid something inside
his throat, some sort of embryo.

344
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,318
He started...

345
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,391
Um, he...

346
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,472
Look, man,
I only need to know one thing:

347
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,551
Where they are.

348
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,200
- Go, Vasquez, kick ass!
- Anytime, anywhere.

349
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:22,717
Somebody said "alien". She thought
they said "illegal alien" and signed up!

350
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,836
- Fuck you, man.
- Anytime, anywhere.

351
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,433
Are you finished?

352
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,988
I hope you're right. I really do.

353
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,839
Yeah, OK, right. Thank you, Ripley.

354
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,310
We also have Ripley's report on disk.
I suggest you study it.

355
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,712
One of those things managed to wipe out
my entire crew in less than 24 hours.

356
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:53,113
If the colonists have found that ship, there's
no telling how many have been exposed.

357
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,553
Do you understand?

358
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,317
Anyway, we have it on disk, so look at it.

359
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,960
Any questions?

360
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,315
What is it, Private?

361
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,278
How do I get out of this chickenshit outfit?

362
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,032
You secure that shit, Hudson.

363
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,312
All right.

364
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,677
Now listen up.

365
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,110
I want this thing to go smooth
and by the numbers.

366
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,630
I want DCS and tactical
database assimilation by 0830.

367
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,748
Ordnance loading, weapons strip and
drop-ship prep details. We have seven hours.

368
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,111
Now move it, people!

369
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,478
You heard the man, and you know the drill!
Assholes and elbows!

370
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,949
Hudson, come here. Come here!

371
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,398
<i>I don't care if you are short, Hudson.
Get it done!</i>

372
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,270
- Sarge, you'll get lip cancer smoking those!
- Corporal, I want this loading lock sealed!

373
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,040
- How many more, Spunkmeyer?
- Last one.

374
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,917
Good. Take it away.

375
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,391
Clear behind.

376
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,998
Did you check number three?
Is this the non-op?

377
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,550
I feel like kind of a fifth wheel.
Is there anything I can do?

378
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,949
I don't know. Is there anything you can do?

379
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,510
Well, I can drive that loader.

380
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,831
I have a Class Two rating.

381
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,592
Be my guest.

382
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,918
Where you want it?

383
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,437
Bay twelve, please.

384
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,756
<i>We're a team and
there's nothing to worry about.</i>

385
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:45,073
We come here, and we gonna conquer, and
we gonna take some. Is that understood?

386
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,550
That's what we gonna do, sweethearts.
Gonna go and get some.

387
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,234
All right, people, on the ready-line!

388
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,958
<i>- Are you lean?
- Yeah!</i>

389
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,473
- Are you mean?
- Yeah!

390
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,596
- What are you?
- Lean, mean Marines!

391
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,679
Get on the ready-line! Get some today!

392
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,791
Get on the ready-line!

393
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,076
Move it out!
Move it out, goddamn it!

394
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,789
Get hot! One, two, three!
Get out! Get out! Get out!

395
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,077
Move it out! Move it out! Move it out!

396
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,754
One, two, three, four! One, two, three!

397
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,436
Absolutely badasses!

398
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,670
Let's pack 'em in! Get in there!

399
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,752
Move it!

400
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,833
- Let's go, let's go!
- One, two, three, four, five, six!

401
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,718
I want combat seating. You know your places.

402
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,230
Get those weapons stowed. Let's go!

403
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,311
Come on, settle down, people.

404
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,676
Lock 'em in, Hudson.

405
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,911
Ready to get it on? You know it!

406
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,594
OK, Bishop, let's go.

407
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,716
Roger.

408
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,471
I'm ready, man.

409
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,510
Ready to get it on! Go!

410
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,319
<i>Stand by. Cross-locking now.
Pre-launch auto-cycle engaged.</i>

411
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,790
Primary couplers released.
Hit the internals.

412
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,155
<i>Confirm cross-lock
and drop stations secured.</i>

413
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,038
<i>Affirmative.
All drop stations secured.</i>

414
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,039
Stand by. Ten seconds.

415
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,954
Stand by to initiate release sequencer.

416
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,439
On my mark.

417
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,755
We're on an express elevator to hell!

418
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,955
Going down!

419
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,918
Two, one, mark.

420
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,390
Whoo-hoo!

421
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,508
Switch to DCS ranging.

422
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,912
- 2-4-0. Nominal to profile.
- We're in the pipe. Five by five.

423
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,716
- We're picking up some hull ionisation.
- Got it. Rough air ahead.

424
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,995
We're in for some chop.

425
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,318
How many drops is this for you, Lieutenant?

426
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,834
38.

427
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,788
Simulated.

428
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,916
How many combat drops?

429
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,558
Uh, two...

430
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,918
...including this one.

431
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,197
<i>- Shit!
- Oh, man!</i>

432
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,154
Range 0-1-4. Turning on final.

433
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,793
<i>I got a bad feeling about this drop.</i>

434
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,429
<i>You always say
"I got a bad feeling about this drop".</i>

435
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,669
OK, OK.

436
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,070
When we get back without you,
I'll call your folks.

437
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,509
All right. Let's see what we can see.

438
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,076
Everybody on-line. Looking good.

439
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,196
Drake, check your camera.
There seems to be a malfunction.

440
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,474
That's better.

441
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,834
Pan it around a bit. Good.

442
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:55,550
<i>I'm ready, man. Check it out.
I am the ultimate badass!</i>

443
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,029
State-of-the-badass-art!

444
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,908
You do not wanna fuck with me.

445
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,797
Check it out.

446
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,190
Hey, Ripley, don't worry.

447
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,558
Me and my squad of ultimate
badasses will protect you.

448
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,238
Check it out.

449
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,196
Independently targeting
particle-beam phalanx.

450
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,838
Whap!

451
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,119
Fry half a city with this puppy!
We got tactical smart missiles...

452
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:29,911
...phase plasma pulse rifles, RPGs...
We got sonic electronic ballbreakers!

453
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,197
We got nukes.
We got knives, sharp sticks...

454
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,838
<i>Knock it off, Hudson!</i>

455
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,069
All right, gear up.

456
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,789
Two minutes, people. Get hot.

457
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,552
Somebody wake up Hicks.

458
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,836
- Coming around for a seven-zero-niner.
- Terminal guidance locked in.

459
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,717
Where's the damn beacon?

460
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,312
Oh, I see it.

461
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,231
- That's the atmosphere processor?
- Yep, that's it.

462
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,471
Remarkable piece of machinery.
Completely automated.

463
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,949
We manufacture those, by the way.

464
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,876
<i>OK, Ferro.</i>

465
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,190
Take us in low over the main colony complex.

466
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,795
Storm shutters are sealed.

467
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,589
There's no visible activity.
All right. Hold at forty.

468
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,513
<i>- Roger.
- Give me a slow circle of the complex.</i>

469
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,638
Structure seems intact.

470
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,231
They still have power.

471
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,153
<i>OK, Ferro.
Set down on the landing grid.</i>

472
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,277
Immediate dust-off on my clear,
then stay on station.

473
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,955
<i>Down and clear.</i>

474
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,110
Ten seconds, people. Look sharp!

475
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,271
I want a nice, clean dispersal this time.

476
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,831
Let's go! Move it out!

477
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,751
Head 'em out!

478
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,919
First squad up, on-line.
Hicks, get yours in a cordon. Watch the rear.

479
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,752
<i>Vasquez, take point.</i>

480
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,398
Let's move!

481
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,959
Move up.

482
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,271
Hudson, run a bypass.

483
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,198
Second squad, move up.
Flanking positions.

484
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,918
<i>Second squad, on-line.</i>

485
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,831
<i>You set?</i>

486
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,912
Go on.

487
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,479
Second team, move inside.

488
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,551
<i>Hicks, take the upper level.</i>

489
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,875
<i>Sir, you copying this?</i>

490
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,474
<i>Looks like hits from small-arms fire.</i>

491
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:00,588
<i>We got some explosive damages,
probably seismic survey charges.</i>

492
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,113
<i>Are you reading this?</i>

493
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,758
<i>Keep it tight, people.</i>

494
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,710
<i>Hicks, Hudson,
use your motion trackers.</i>

495
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,992
<i>Nothing.</i>

496
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,275
Not a goddamn thing.

497
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,751
Quarter and search by twos.

498
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,994
<i>OK, Dietrich, Frost, you're up.</i>

499
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,557
It's right in there.

500
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,194
- Now!
- Now!

501
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,874
Good one, Hudson!

502
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,909
Uh, sir, we have a negative situation here.
Uh, moving on, sir.

503
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,551
Wait, tell him to...

504
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,952
Hicks, back up.

505
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,792
Pan right.

506
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,792
There.

507
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,711
<i>You seeing this?</i>

508
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,958
<i>Looks melted. Somebody must have
bagged one of Ripley's bad guys here.</i>

509
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,758
Acid for blood.

510
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,957
<i>If you liked that, you're gonna love this.</i>

511
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,551
Quit screwing around.

512
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,790
Second squad, what's your status?

513
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,917
<i>We just finished our sweep.
Nobody's home.</i>

514
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,956
Roger. Sir, this place is dead.

515
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,600
<i>Whatever happened here, we missed it.</i>

516
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,031
The area's secured.

517
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,872
Let's go check their computer.

518
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,269
- It's not secure.
- The area's secured.

519
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,238
First team, head for Operations.

520
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,278
<i>- Hudson, get their CPU on-line.
- Affirmative.</i>

521
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:25,670
Hicks, meet me at the south lock.
We're coming in.

522
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,150
He's coming in. I feel safer already.

523
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,231
Pendejo jerkoff!

524
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,839
<i>Sir, we got the CPU on-line.</i>

525
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,399
<i>No problem.</i>

526
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,948
Good. Stand by in Operations.

527
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,558
OK, let's go.

528
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,672
Are you all right?

529
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,439
Yes.

530
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,272
Sir... They sealed off this wing at both ends.

531
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:47,070
Welded the doors, and blocked off
the stairs with heavy equipment.

532
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,072
But it looks like the barricade didn't hold.

533
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,432
- Any bodies?
- No, sir.

534
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,192
Last stand.

535
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,748
<i>Must have been a hell of a fight.</i>

536
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,831
Yeah, looks that way.

537
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:06,229
All right, Drake, this way. You should be able
to cut through the med lab to Operations.

538
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,831
<i>Lieutenant.</i>

539
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,438
Gorman.

540
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,276
Are those the same ones?

541
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:32,949
Careful, Burke.

542
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,875
Looks like love at first sight to me.

543
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,030
Oh, he likes you, Burke.

544
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,793
Two are alive. The rest are dead.

545
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,431
Surgically removed
before embryo implantation.

546
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:00,399
Subject: Marachuk, John J,
died during the procedure.

547
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,429
They killed him taking it off.

548
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,038
Yo, Hicks.

549
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,671
I think we got something here.

550
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,471
- Behind us.
- One of us?

551
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,438
<i>Apone, where are your people?</i>

552
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,195
<i>- Anybody in D-Block?
- Negative. We're all in Operations.</i>

553
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,589
- Talk to me, Frosty.
- Let's keep moving, baby.

554
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,510
- It's moving.
- Which way?

555
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,556
It's coming straight for us.

556
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,232
Straight up.

557
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,071
- Fuck!
- Hold up!

558
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,599
Ripley.

559
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,994
Hey... shh, it's all right.

560
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,514
- It's all right.
- Grab her, Corporal.

561
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:01,558
Don't be afraid.
Come on. We won't hurt you.

562
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,995
Shh... it's all right. It's OK.

563
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:07,152
Come on out. Come on. Easy, easy.

564
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,070
I got her!

565
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,037
Ow! Damn!

566
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,759
- Don't let her go!
- She's under the grill!

567
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,150
- Frost, get your light up here.
- Where'd she go?

568
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,831
Shine the light!

569
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,478
Down here.

570
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,198
Here. Here.

571
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,794
<i>Keep back. Don't scare her.</i>

572
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,474
- Grab her, man! We're gonna lose her!
- Damn it!

573
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,717
<i>Wait!</i>

574
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,998
It's OK. It's all right.

575
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,718
Don't be afraid.

576
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,232
See?

577
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,551
Wait! No, you don't!

578
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,950
It's OK! You're gonna be all right now!

579
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,076
<i>Shh!</i>

580
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:22,118
Easy! Easy!

581
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,033
It's gonna be OK. It's all right.
You're gonna be OK.

582
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,634
Shh, shh, shh!

583
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,472
Easy.

584
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,631
Easy.

585
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,714
- What's her name again?
- Rebecca.

586
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,110
Now think, Rebecca. Concentrate.

587
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,030
Just start at the beginning.

588
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,315
Where are your parents?

589
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,518
Look, Rebecca...

590
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,070
Gorman, give it a rest, why don't you?

591
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,397
Total brainlock.

592
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:32,190
Physically she's OK. Borderline malnutrition,
but no permanent damage.

593
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,350
Come on. We're wasting our time.

594
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,033
Try this.

595
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,151
It's a little hot chocolate.

596
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,197
There you go.

597
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,151
Whoop.

598
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,596
That good, huh?

599
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,709
Uh-oh.

600
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,951
I made a clean spot here.

601
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:07,237
Now I've done it!
Guess I'll have to do the whole thing.

602
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:20,354
Hard to believe there's
a little girl under all this.

603
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,951
And a pretty one, too.

604
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,278
You don't talk much, do you?

605
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:43,079
- Smoking or non-smoking?
- Just tell me what you're scanning for.

606
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:49,030
PDT's. Personal data transmitters.
Every colonist had one surgically implanted.

607
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:52,112
If they're within 20 clicks,
we'll read it out here.

608
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,316
So far, zippo.

609
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:59,599
I don't know how you managed to stay alive,
but you're one brave kid, Rebecca.

610
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,349
Newt.

611
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,353
- What did you say?
- Newt.

612
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,715
My name's Newt.

613
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,791
Nobody calls me Rebecca...

614
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,871
...except my brother.

615
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,313
Newt.

616
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,518
I like that.

617
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,629
I'm Ripley.

618
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,351
It's nice to meet you.

619
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,915
And who is this? Hm?

620
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,033
Casey.

621
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:31,914
Hello, Casey.

622
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,878
What about your brother? What's his name?

623
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,598
Timmy.

624
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:41,319
Is Timmy around here, too?
Maybe hiding like you were?

625
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,031
Any sisters?

626
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,399
Mom and Dad?

627
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,037
Newt, look at me.

628
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:01,193
- Where are they?
- They're dead, all right? Can I go now?

629
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,997
I'm sorry, Newt.

630
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,072
Don't you think you'd be safer here with us?

631
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,755
These people are here to protect you.

632
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,751
They're soldiers.

633
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,513
It won't make any difference.

634
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,431
Need anything else?

635
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,673
Hello, Bishop. Do you need anything else?

636
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:42,874
No.

637
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,476
Nice pet you got there.

638
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,232
Magnificent, isn't it?

639
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,834
Yo! Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!

640
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,279
Found 'em.

641
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,475
They alive?

642
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,711
Unknown, but it looks like all of 'em...

643
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,075
...over at the processing station...

644
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,798
...sub-level three...

645
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,189
...under the main cooling towers.

646
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:09,909
It looks like a goddamn town meeting.

647
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,116
Let's saddle up, Apone.

648
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,713
Aye, sir.

649
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:17,630
Let's go, people.
They ain't payin' us by the hour.

650
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:20,632
Head 'em out!
OK, Frost, you're driving.

651
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,236
It's OK. Don't worry. It'll be OK.

652
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,353
<i>I want a straight Vdeployment.</i>

653
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,271
<i>Second team on left flank.</i>

654
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,550
<i>Advance on axial six-six-four.</i>

655
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,949
<i>Tracker on-line.
Set the V-gain to filter R-F ambient.</i>

656
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:28,828
<i>Hudson, tracker on-line.
Left and right, little buddy.</i>

657
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,909
<i>40 metres in, bearing two-two-one,
there should be a stairwell.</i>

658
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,232
<i>Check. Got it.</i>

659
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,354
<i>You want sub-level three.</i>

660
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:46,191
<i>Let's go, people. Hudson,
you got the point. Hicks, watch our tails.</i>

661
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:49,238
Nice and easy. Check those corners.

662
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,991
<i>Check those corners.</i>

663
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,471
Watch your spacing.

664
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:59,313
<i>You heard the man. Don't bunch up.</i>

665
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,868
Your transmission's showing break-up.

666
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:05,953
<i>Probably getting
interference from the structure.</i>

667
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,031
<i>Use those lights.</i>

668
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:12,388
<i>Next one down,
and proceed on a two-one-six.</i>

669
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,516
<i>Roger, that's a two-one-six.</i>

670
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:19,712
<i>I'm not making that out too well.
What is it, Hudson?</i>

671
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,394
<i>You tell me, man. I only work here.</i>

672
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:38,959
What is that?

673
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:41,155
I don't know.

674
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:43,992
Proceed inside.

675
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:03,312
<i>Watch your fire
and check your targets.</i>

676
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,392
<i>Remember we're looking for civvies in here.</i>

677
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,274
<i>Easy.</i>

678
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:19,955
<i>Tighten it up, Frost.
We're getting a little thin.</i>

679
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,591
<i>Nice and easy.</i>

680
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:26,832
Looks like some sort of secreted resin.

681
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:30,595
Yeah... but secreted from what?

682
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,240
Nobody touch nothing.

683
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,150
Busy little creatures, huh?

684
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:40,236
- Hot as hell in here.
- Yeah, man, but it's a dry heat.

685
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,636
Knock it off, Hudson.

686
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:55,392
- Lieutenant, what do those pulse rifles fire?
- Ten-millimetre explosive-tip caseless.

687
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:59,598
- Standard light armour-piercing round. Why?
- Look where your team is.

688
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:03,036
They're right under
the primary heat exchangers.

689
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:03,836
So?

690
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:09,276
So, if they fire their weapons in there,
won't they rupture the cooling system?

691
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:12,591
- Yeah. She's absolutely right.
- So what?

692
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:16,753
This whole station is basically
a big fusion reactor.

693
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,954
Right?

694
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:23,631
<i>So she's talking about a thermonuclear
explosion and "Adiós, muchachos".</i>

695
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:26,280
Oh, great. Wonderful.

696
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,878
Shit!

697
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,189
Look.

698
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,589
Uh... Apone.

699
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:36,955
Look.

700
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:42,793
We can't have any firing in there. I want
you to collect magazines from everybody.

701
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,759
- Is he fuckin' crazy?
- What do we use? Harsh language?

702
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,752
<i>- Flame units only.
- Sir, I...</i>

703
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,513
<i>Just do it, Sergeant. And no grenades.</i>

704
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:58,033
All right, sweethearts. You heard the man.
Let's have 'em.

705
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,920
Come on, Vasquez. Clear and lock.

706
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,558
Damn!

707
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,831
You, too. Give it up, Ski.

708
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,309
Crowe, I want it now. Give it up.

709
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,671
<i>Right on, Vas.</i>

710
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:18,715
Let's go, Marine. Give it up.
Frost, you got the duty. Open that bag.

711
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,553
- Thanks a lot, Sarge.
- Hicks, cover our ass.

712
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,471
Head 'em out, people.

713
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:29,388
I like to keep this handy,
for close encounters.

714
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,879
<i>I heard that.</i>

715
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,356
<i>Any movement?</i>

716
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,908
<i>Nothing. Zip.</i>

717
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,232
Holy shit!

718
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,111
<i>Newt, go sit up front.</i>

719
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,394
Go on!

720
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,674
Now!

721
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,718
<i>Steady, people.
Let's finish our sweep.</i>

722
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:50,269
<i>We're still Marines, and we got a job to do.
Keep it moving.</i>

723
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,714
<i>Easy.</i>

724
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:24,915
- Top!
- What?

725
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,592
We got a live one!

726
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:30,753
- You're gonna be all right.
- Please... kill me.

727
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,671
<i>Stay calm. We'll get you out.</i>

728
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,791
<i>It's gonna be all right.</i>

729
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,678
<i>- We've got to get her out!
- What is it, Dietrich?</i>

730
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:38,556
Convulsion!

731
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,270
Ohh!

732
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,476
<i>Dietrich, get back! Get back!</i>

733
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,436
Aagh!

734
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:44,959
<i>Aagh!</i>

735
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,595
No!

736
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,512
<i>Frost, flamethrower!</i>

737
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,160
Get back! Flamethrower! Move!

738
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,358
<i>Movement!</i>

739
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,829
What's the position?

740
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,996
I can't lock in!

741
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,355
Talk to me, Hudson!

742
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,477
Multiple signals!

743
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,596
They're closing!

744
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,875
Go to infrared, people.

745
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:41,836
<i>Look sharp!</i>

746
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,037
What's happening, Apone?
We can't see anything in here.

747
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,076
Pull your team out, Gorman.

748
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,279
<i>I got readings in front and behind!</i>

749
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,509
Where, man?

750
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,715
<i>I don't see shit.</i>

751
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,950
He's right. There's nothing back here.

752
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:02,395
Something's moving and it ain't us!

753
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,239
Shit!

754
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:10,394
<i>Tracker's off-scale, man.
They're all around us, man! Jesus!</i>

755
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,838
Maybe they don't show up on infrared at all.

756
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,316
Aagh!

757
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,714
Aagh!

758
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,069
Frost!

759
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:24,876
Aagh!

760
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,351
Come on!

761
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,557
Aagh!

762
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,549
Jesus Christ, Apone! What is going on!

763
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,995
<i>Wierzbowski and Crowe are down!</i>

764
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,913
Dietrich! Crowe! Sound off!

765
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:46,955
Frost!

766
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:49,508
<i>Frost!</i>

767
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,953
Wierzbowski!

768
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:55,709
Wierzbowski!

769
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,753
<i>Let's rock!</i>

770
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:00,829
<i>Yeah!</i>

771
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:04,959
Who's firing? Goddamn it!

772
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,191
I ordered a "hold fire".

773
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,436
They're coming out of
the goddamn walls in swarms!

774
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:18,355
Uh, Apone, I want you to lay down
a suppressing fire with...

775
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,000
<i>Vasquez! Drake! Hold your fire!</i>

776
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:24,914
<i>Are you copying me?
Lay down a suppressing fire...</i>

777
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,752
...with the incinerators,
and fall back by squads.

778
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:29,798
Say again? All after incinerators.

779
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:34,431
Lay down a suppressing fire
with the incinerators, and fall back...

780
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:38,835
Aagh!

781
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:41,229
<i>Sarge!</i>

782
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,673
Apone...

783
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,318
...talk to me.

784
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,389
Apone?

785
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,630
- Talk to me!
- He's gone!

786
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,589
Get them out of there! Now!

787
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:54,638
- Shut up!
- Hicks, whoever's left, get the hell...

788
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,438
- Shut up!
- Goddamn it!

789
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,753
<i>Where's Apone?! Where's Apone?!</i>

790
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:03,832
<i>The Sarge is gone!
Let's get the fuck out of here!</i>

791
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,031
<i>Let's go, Marines!</i>

792
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:07,869
Hudson?

793
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,837
Vasquez?

794
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,915
<i>- Hudson, look out!
- Get it!</i>

795
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,833
<i>Hudson!</i>

796
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,718
<i>- Hicks! Hicks!
- It's too much! Fall back!</i>

797
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,472
I told them to fall back.

798
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,552
- I told them to fall back.
- They're cut off!

799
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,558
Do something!

800
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,150
Fuck!

801
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:28,675
<i>Keep movin'!</i>

802
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:29,829
Hold on, Newt.

803
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:38,599
Ripley, what the hell are you doing!

804
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,432
<i>Turn around!</i>

805
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:50,959
That's an order!

806
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,590
<i>- Get off me!
- Goddamn it, that's an order!</i>

807
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,319
You had your chance, Gorman.

808
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,992
Come on!

809
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,598
<i>Come on, Drake!</i>

810
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,239
<i>Let's move it!</i>

811
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,635
<i>Come on! Let's go! Let's go!</i>

812
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,992
<i>It's blocked, man!
We got to go around!</i>

813
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,752
Open the door! Hicks!

814
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:45,434
Drake! We are leaving!

815
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,153
Get them, Vas!

816
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,154
Run for it!

817
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:53,189
Shit!

818
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:00,154
- Let's go!
- Drake, come on, man!

819
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,558
Drake, come on!

820
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:13,476
Aagh!

821
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,230
- Aaaghhh!
- No!

822
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,952
<i>Fire in the hold!</i>

823
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:22,793
- He's gone!
- No! Drake's out there!

824
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,393
Put it out!

825
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,311
Drake's coming!

826
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,833
He's gone!

827
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,399
No, he's... not!

828
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,637
Forget him! He's gone!

829
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,231
Get on the goddamn door!

830
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,315
Eat this!

831
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:46,916
Aagh!

832
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,313
<i>Ripley! Go, go, go!</i>

833
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:01,676
Whoa!

834
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:02,556
Oh!

835
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:54,314
It's all right! We're clear!

836
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:57,836
Ripley, you've blown the transaxle!
You're just grinding metal!

837
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,512
Come on, ease down.

838
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:01,395
Ease down.

839
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,558
Ease down!

840
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:05,635
Ease down.

841
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,030
<i>You OK?</i>

842
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,271
I'm all right.

843
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,431
Get away from me, man!

844
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,918
- Lieutenant.
- What happened to Gorman?

845
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,912
I don't know... Maybe a concussion.

846
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,709
- But he's alive.
- No, man, he's dead!

847
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:37,395
<i>- Wake up, pendejo! I'm gonna kill you!
- Back off!</i>

848
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,311
Right now.

849
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,550
Somebody get me a first-aid kit.

850
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:45,835
Hey. Hey, look!

851
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:51,718
The Sarge and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Their signs are real low, but they ain't dead.

852
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:55,315
- Then we go back in there and get them.
- I ain't going back!

853
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,277
You can't help them!

854
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:03,351
You can't. Right now they're
being cocooned just like the others.

855
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:11,230
Oh, dear Lord Jesus,
this ain't happenin', man.

856
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:14,596
This can't be happenin', man.
This isn't happenin'!

857
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:17,997
We've got seven canisters of CN-20.

858
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:21,595
I say we roll them in there
and nerve-gas the whole fuckin' nest.

859
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:24,672
It's worth a try, but we
don't know if it'll affect 'em.

860
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:28,594
Let's bug out and call it even.
Why even talk about it?

861
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:32,116
I say we take off and
nuke the entire site from orbit.

862
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,711
It's the only way to be sure.

863
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,917
- Fuckin' A!
- Hold on one second.

864
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,993
This installation has a substantial
dollar value attached to it.

865
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,399
<i>They can bill me.</i>

866
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,149
OK, look.

867
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:52,358
This is an emotional moment
for all of us, OK? I know that.

868
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:55,079
But let's not make snap judgments, please.

869
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:58,277
This is clearly an important species
we're dealing with...

870
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:01,636
...and I don't think anybody
has the right to arbitrarily...

871
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,438
...exterminate them.
- Wrong.

872
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:04,999
Yeah. Watch us.

873
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:09,915
Maybe you aren't up on current events,
but we just got our asses kicked, pal!

874
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,754
Look, I'm not blind to what's going on...

875
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,912
...but I cannot authorise that kind of action.

876
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:23,711
Well, I believe Corporal Hicks
has authority here.

877
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,991
Corporal Hicks is...

878
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:30,277
This operation is under military jurisdiction.

879
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:33,909
Hicks is next in chain of command.
Am I right, Corporal?

880
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,797
Yeah.

881
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:38,910
Yeah, that's right.

882
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,790
Yeah. Look, Ripley, this is
a multimillion-dollar installation, OK?

883
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:46,792
He can't make that decision. He's just a grunt.

884
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:47,869
No offence.

885
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,632
None taken.

886
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,035
<i>- Ferro, do you copy?
- Standing by.</i>

887
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:55,908
<i>- Prep for dust-off. We need immediate evac.
- Roger. On our way.</i>

888
01:19:56,040 --> 01:20:00,670
I say we take off... nuke the site from orbit.
It's the only way to be sure.

889
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:04,872
Let's do it.

890
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:15,589
Let's go! Pick it up, Hudson.
Pick it up, baby.

891
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,436
All right. Set him down here.

892
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,431
Move it, Spunkmeyer. We're rolling.

893
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,594
Hold on a second. There's something...

894
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,671
<i>Just get up here.</i>

895
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,996
I'm in. Ramp closing.

896
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:02,639
Spunkmeyer.

897
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,149
Goddamn it.

898
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,797
Well, where the fuck...

899
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:22,637
Run!

900
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:06,796
Well, that's great.
That's just fuckin' great, man.

901
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,630
Now what the fuck are we supposed to do?
We're in some real pretty shit now, man!

902
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,790
Are you finished?

903
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:18,477
You all right?

904
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:26,955
I guess we're not
gonna be leaving now, right?

905
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,231
I'm sorry, Newt.

906
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,993
You don't have to be sorry.
It wasn't your fault.

907
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,356
That's it, man. Game over, man! Game over!

908
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:38,159
What the fuck are we gonna do now?
What are we gonna do?!

909
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:42,153
Maybe we could build a fire, sing
a couple of songs. Why don't we try that?

910
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:46,711
We'd better get back cos it'll be dark soon,
and they mostly come at night.

911
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,518
Mostly.

912
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,151
That's everything, right?

913
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:11,030
This is absolutely everything
we could salvage out of the APC wreckage.

914
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:14,317
We got four pulse rifles
with about 50 rounds each.

915
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,391
That ain't so good.

916
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,276
We got 15 of these M-40 grenades.

917
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:22,351
Don't touch that.

918
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:23,953
Dangerous, honey.

919
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:28,750
- Is that the only flamethrower?
- Yeah. It's only half full, but it's functional.

920
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:32,469
And another one's damaged.
I don't know about that one.

921
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:34,508
But the good news...

922
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:38,078
We got four of these robot sentries...

923
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:41,072
...with display and scanners intact.

924
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:43,754
They really kick ass. They'll come in handy.

925
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:47,628
How long after we're declared overdue
can we expect a rescue?

926
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,552
17 days.

927
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:55,311
17 days?

928
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:59,712
Hey, man, I don't wanna rain on your parade,
but we're not gonna last 17 hours!

929
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:03,315
Those things are gonna come in here
like they did before, and...

930
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,516
Hudson! Hudson!

931
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:11,309
This little girl survived longer than that
with no weapons and no training.

932
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,389
Right?

933
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,354
<i>- Why don't you put her in charge?
- You better start dealing with it, Hudson.</i>

934
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:23,149
Listen to me.
Deal with it, because we need you...

935
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:25,231
...and I'm sick of your bullshit.

936
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:29,552
Now get on a terminal and call up
a floor-plan file. Do you understand?

937
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:33,633
Construction blueprints. Anything that
shows the layout. Are you listening?

938
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:35,233
Yeah.

939
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:39,991
I need to see air ducts, electrical
access tunnels, sub-basements...

940
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,719
...every possible way into this complex.

941
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,472
We don't have much time.

942
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:47,152
OK.

943
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,311
- OK, I'm on it.
- Hudson...

944
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,072
Just relax.

945
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:59,597
I'll be in med lab.

946
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:02,990
I'll check on Gorman, continue my analysis.

947
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:03,990
Fine.

948
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:05,999
You do that.

949
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:15,515
So this service tunnel must be
how they're moving back and forth.

950
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:19,912
Right. It moves from the processing
station right into the sub-level here.

951
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,431
Come down on that.

952
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,317
OK, come over.

953
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,792
Hold it. Go back.
OK, punch that in right there.

954
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:36,070
- No. It's back here.
- OK.

955
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,080
Well, there's a pressure door at this end.

956
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:43,630
Couldn't we put a remote
sentry unit in the tunnel...

957
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:47,554
...and then seal that door?
- But we gotta figure on them getting in.

958
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,676
That's right, so...

959
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:53,309
...we repair the barricades
at these two intersections...

960
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:57,712
...and weld plate steel
over these ducts here, and here...

961
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:58,994
...and here.

962
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,512
Then they can only come at us
from these two corridors.

963
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:06,229
Right. Then we put
the other sentry units here...

964
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,912
...and here. Right?

965
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,991
- Right.
- Outstanding.

966
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,355
Now all we need is a deck of cards.

967
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,554
All right, let's move
like we've got a purpose.

968
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:19,279
- Affirmative.
- Affirmative.

969
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,638
Do your thing, baby.

970
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:38,029
Vasquez, let's get the hell out of here.

971
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:41,430
<i>- A and B sentries are in place and keyed.
- Roger.</i>

972
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,556
Stand by. Arming now.

973
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,039
Test it, Hudson.

974
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,429
- Do it!
- Fire in the hole!

975
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:53,433
OK! Let's get the hell out of here!

976
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,511
We're sealing the tunnel!

977
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:56,589
Come on, baby.

978
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:10,271
For what it's worth...

979
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,195
Here, I want you to put this on.

980
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:16,396
What's it for?

981
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:21,110
It's a locator. Then I can find you
anywhere in the complex... on this.

982
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,791
It's just a precaution.

983
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,519
Thanks.

984
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:29,514
Doesn't mean we're engaged or anything.

985
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,511
All right, what's next?

986
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,319
Last stop.

987
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,319
Get in.

988
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:08,948
Scoot down.

989
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:11,554
That's good.

990
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:13,949
Now you lie here and have a nap.

991
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:15,519
You're very tired.

992
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,831
I don't want to. I have scary dreams.

993
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,873
Well, I bet Casey doesn't have scary dreams.

994
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:25,673
Let's take a look.

995
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:28,316
Nope. Nothing bad in there.

996
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,549
See?

997
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:32,115
Maybe you could just try to be like her.

998
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:35,274
Ripley, she doesn't have bad dreams...

999
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:37,999
...because she's just a piece of plastic.

1000
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:39,354
Right.

1001
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:41,512
I'm sorry, Newt.

1002
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:48,949
There.

1003
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:54,119
My mommy always said there
were no monsters. No real ones.

1004
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,156
But there are.

1005
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:59,277
Yes, there are, aren't there?

1006
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,599
Why do they tell little kids that?

1007
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:07,191
Most of the time it's true.

1008
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:10,590
Did one of those things grow inside her?

1009
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:13,148
I don't know, Newt.

1010
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:15,310
That's the truth.

1011
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:17,789
Isn't that how babies come?

1012
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,871
I mean, people babies?

1013
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:23,509
- They grow inside you.
- No. That's very different.

1014
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,477
Did you ever have a baby?

1015
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:26,993
Yes, I did.

1016
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,513
I had a little girl.

1017
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:30,477
Where is she?

1018
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:32,993
She's gone.

1019
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,598
You mean dead.

1020
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:39,559
Here.

1021
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:42,912
Take this.

1022
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,152
For luck.

1023
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,231
How's that?

1024
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:54,351
Don't go! Please!

1025
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:57,000
Newt, I'm gonna be right in the next room.

1026
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:59,711
And you see that camera?

1027
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:02,473
I can see you through that camera...

1028
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:05,279
...all the time, to see if you're safe.

1029
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,798
I'm not gonna leave you, Newt.

1030
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,438
I mean that.

1031
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,397
That's a promise.

1032
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:16,993
You promise?

1033
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,312
I cross my heart.

1034
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,038
And hope to die?

1035
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:24,554
And hope to die.

1036
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,152
Now go to sleep...

1037
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:43,111
...and don't dream.

1038
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:48,439
Sneak.

1039
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:01,757
The molecular acid oxidises after the
creature's death, completely neutralising.

1040
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:04,912
Bishop, that's interesting,
but it gets us nowhere.

1041
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,596
I'm trying to figure out what we're dealing
with here. Let's go through it again.

1042
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:14,959
They grab the colonists and immobilise them
to be hosts for more of these.

1043
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:19,356
So there would have to be
a lot of these parasites.

1044
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,749
One for each colonist.
A hundred at least.

1045
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,671
Yes, that follows.

1046
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:27,435
Each one of these things
comes from an egg, right?

1047
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:31,951
So who's laying these eggs?

1048
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:36,914
I'm not sure.
It must be something we haven't seen yet.

1049
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,389
Hey, maybe it's like an ant hive.

1050
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:42,552
- Bees, man. Bees have hives.
- You know what I mean.

1051
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:46,189
There's, like, one female
that runs the whole show.

1052
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:48,555
- Yes. The queen.
- Yeah, the mama.

1053
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:51,313
<i>And she's badass, man. I mean big.</i>

1054
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:53,470
- These things ain't ants.
- I know that!

1055
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:59,031
Bishop, I want these specimens destroyed
as soon as you're finished with them.

1056
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:04,672
Mr Burke said they were to be kept alive
in stasis for return to the company labs.

1057
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:09,835
He was very specific about it.

1058
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:13,993
Those two specimens are worth millions
to the bio-weapons division.

1059
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:17,470
If you're smart, we can both
come out of this heroes...

1060
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:19,994
...and we will be set up for life.

1061
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:23,714
You're crazy, Burke. Do you know that?

1062
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:28,231
You really think you can get a dangerous
organism like that past ICC quarantine?

1063
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:31,312
How can they impound it
if they don't know about it?

1064
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:33,994
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.

1065
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:38,358
Just like they'll know you were responsible
for the deaths of 157 colonists.

1066
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:41,273
- Wait a second!
- You sent them to that ship.

1067
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:46,559
I just checked the colony log: Directive
dated 6-12-79, signed Burke, Carter J.

1068
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:50,838
You sent them out there
and you didn't even warn them.

1069
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:55,038
What if that ship didn't even exist?
Did you think about that? I didn't know.

1070
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:59,238
So now if I make a major security situation
out of it, everybody steps in...

1071
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:02,790
...and there's no exclusive rights
for anybody. Nobody wins.

1072
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:08,238
So I made a decision and it was wrong.
It was a bad call, Ripley. A bad call.

1073
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:13,348
Bad call? These people are dead, Burke!
Have you any idea what you've done here!

1074
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:16,238
I'm gonna make sure
they nail you right to the wall.

1075
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:18,754
You won't sleaze your way out of this one.

1076
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:20,592
Right to the wall.

1077
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:23,309
Ripley.

1078
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:30,269
You know, I expected more from you.
I thought you'd be smarter than this.

1079
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,191
I'm happy to disappoint you.

1080
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:48,271
What is it? What's going on?

1081
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:49,793
- They're coming.
- Where?

1082
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:51,359
In the tunnel.

1083
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:54,034
Here we go.

1084
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:56,554
A and B gun tracking and firing.

1085
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:58,073
Multiple targets.

1086
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:05,471
Look at those ammo counters go.

1087
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,036
B gun's down 50 per cent.

1088
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:13,355
It's a shooting gallery down there!

1089
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:18,792
60 rounds left on B.

1090
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,917
40... 20... 10.

1091
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,150
B gun's dry. 20 on A.

1092
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:26,110
Ten...

1093
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:27,519
...five...

1094
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:32,594
That's it.

1095
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:35,717
Jesus! They're wall-to-wall in there.

1096
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:41,631
They're at the pressure door.

1097
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:45,113
Man, listen to that.

1098
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:48,715
<i>Bishop here. I'm afraid I have some bad news.</i>

1099
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,552
Well, that's a switch!

1100
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:55,756
It's very pretty, Bishop,
but what are we looking for?

1101
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:58,832
That's it. Emergency venting.

1102
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:03,472
That's beautiful, man. That beats it all.

1103
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:05,357
How long till it blows?

1104
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,351
Four hours...

1105
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:11,877
...with a blast radius of 30 kilometres,
equal to about 40 megatons.

1106
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:16,230
- We got problems.
- I don't fuckin' believe this!

1107
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:18,551
Vasquez, close the shutters.

1108
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:20,835
Why can't we shut it down from here?

1109
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:25,552
The crash caused too much damage.
An overload was inevitable at this point.

1110
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:30,156
Oh, man! And I was getting short!
Four more weeks and out.

1111
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:33,596
- Now I'm gonna buy it on this rock!
- Give us a break!

1112
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:36,148
<i>Four more weeks. Oh, man!</i>

1113
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:39,152
We need the other drop-ship from the Sulaco.

1114
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:42,234
Can't we bring it down on remote?

1115
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:45,710
How? The transmitter was on the APC!
It's wasted!

1116
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:48,951
I don't care how,
but we'd better think of something!

1117
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:51,719
Think of what?!
We're fucked! We're doomed!

1118
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:56,271
Shut up! What about the colony transmitters?
The uplink tower at the other end?

1119
01:35:56,360 --> 01:36:00,035
The hard-wiring between
here and there was damaged.

1120
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:02,076
We can't align the dish.

1121
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:07,359
Somebody has to go out there. Take
a portable terminal and patch in manually.

1122
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:12,309
<i>Oh, yeah, sure! With those things
running around? You can count me out.</i>

1123
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:15,153
- We can count you out of everything.
- I'll go.

1124
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:17,356
<i>- Why don't you go, man?
- I'll go.</i>

1125
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,431
- What?
- I'll go.

1126
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:22,239
I'm the only one qualified
to remote-pilot the ship.

1127
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:25,312
<i>Yeah, right, man. Bishop should go.</i>

1128
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:26,515
Good idea!

1129
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:28,670
Believe me, I'd prefer not to.

1130
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:32,594
I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.

1131
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:44,672
<i>How long?</i>

1132
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:47,991
This conduit runs almost
to the uplink assembly. 180 metres.

1133
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:51,152
- Say 40 minutes to crawl down there...
- Right.

1134
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:54,915
...an hour to patch in and align the antenna...

1135
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:59,908
...30 minutes to prep the ship,
and about 50 minutes flight time.

1136
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,718
It's gonna be close.

1137
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:08,194
- Good luck.
- See you soon.

1138
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:11,312
Watch your fingers.

1139
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:16,673
<i>Vaya con Dios, man.</i>

1140
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:30,831
This is unbelievable!

1141
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:33,992
20 metres and closing. 15.

1142
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:35,229
How many?

1143
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:37,834
Can't tell. Lots.

1144
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:40,431
D gun's down 50 per cent.

1145
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:47,437
C gun's right behind it.

1146
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:52,317
<i>It ain't stopping 'em.
It ain't stopping 'em!</i>

1147
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,595
<i>150 rounds on D.</i>

1148
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:56,636
<i>Come on, baby. Come on!</i>

1149
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:57,790
100 rounds.

1150
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:02,159
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

1151
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:08,399
D gun's down to 20.

1152
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:10,391
Ten.

1153
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:14,479
Damn it!

1154
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:17,197
Wait!

1155
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:18,872
They're retreating.

1156
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:26,514
<i>The guns stopped them.</i>

1157
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:30,153
You're right.

1158
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:39,109
Next time they walk right up and knock.

1159
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:41,270
Yeah, but they don't know that.

1160
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:44,551
They're probably looking
for other ways to get in.

1161
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:46,631
That'll take 'em a while.

1162
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:49,109
- Maybe we got 'em demoralised.
- Shut up.

1163
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,755
I want you two walking perimeter.

1164
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:55,508
Move!

1165
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,836
Hey, listen.

1166
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:07,115
We're all in strung-out shape...

1167
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:09,191
...but stay frosty...

1168
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:11,271
...and alert.

1169
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:15,073
We can't afford to let
one of those bastards in here.

1170
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:18,436
<i>All right. Vámonos.</i>

1171
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:29,639
How long's it been since you got any sleep?

1172
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:31,836
24 hours?

1173
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:36,318
Hicks, I'm not gonna end up like those others.

1174
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:39,188
You'll take care of it, won't you?

1175
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:45,072
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.

1176
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:50,872
Let's just make sure
it doesn't come to that, all right?

1177
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:52,916
All right.

1178
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:57,718
Hey, I want to introduce you
to a personal friend of mine.

1179
01:39:58,240 --> 01:40:01,312
This is an M-41A pulse rifle, 10 millimetre...

1180
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:05,598
...with an over-and-under 30 millimetre
pump-action grenade launcher.

1181
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:07,557
Feel the weight.

1182
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:16,396
OK. What do I do?

1183
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:23,835
Pull it in tight here.

1184
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:25,956
- Right.
- Lean into it.

1185
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:28,956
All right, now it will kick some.

1186
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:32,997
When the counter reads zero here, you...

1187
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:35,230
- I press this up?
- That's right.

1188
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:39,834
Get another one in quick. Slap it in hard.

1189
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:42,593
- Right.
- Now you're ready to rock 'n' roll.

1190
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:46,237
- What's this?
- The grenade launcher.

1191
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,436
I don't think you want to mess with that.

1192
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:51,512
You started this. Show me everything.

1193
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:53,952
I can handle myself.

1194
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:57,633
Yeah, I noticed.

1195
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:09,317
How do you feel?

1196
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:12,437
All right, I guess. One hell of a hangover.

1197
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:17,476
- Look, Ripley, I just want...
- Forget it. Excuse me.

1198
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,990
Shh, shh, shh.

1199
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:15,791
It's OK. It's OK.

1200
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:26,197
<i>Newt. Wake up.</i>

1201
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:28,111
- What?
- Be quiet.

1202
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:30,191
We're in trouble.

1203
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:50,073
<i>Agh!</i>

1204
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:52,151
Move, Newt!

1205
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:13,110
Hey!

1206
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:23,312
Help!

1207
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:25,952
Help!

1208
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:27,395
Hicks!

1209
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:29,713
Say again, Bishop?

1210
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:32,997
You've got it into auto-refuel mode
and it's sequencing right?

1211
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:34,399
<i>That's right.</i>

1212
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:36,038
Good. Stay on it.

1213
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:40,435
Get back to me when you've
activated the launch cycle.

1214
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:44,078
- He's at the uplink tower.
- Terrific.

1215
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:50,791
- Hicks! Hicks!
- Help! Help!

1216
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:52,359
Hicks! Help us!

1217
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:53,998
Break the glass!

1218
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,275
Break it, break it!

1219
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:57,952
I'll try.

1220
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:20,194
Ripley, I'm scared.

1221
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:21,949
Me, too.

1222
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:28,788
Stay here.

1223
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:43,551
It's the med lab. Hudson!

1224
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:46,552
Vasquez! Meet me in med lab! We got a fire!

1225
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:48,631
<i>We're on our way.</i>

1226
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:54,239
They're coming, Newt.

1227
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:01,351
Urgh!

1228
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:09,639
Aagh!

1229
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,752
Shoot it out!

1230
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:32,431
- Hudson!
- Jesus!

1231
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:35,235
Oh!

1232
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:38,070
Christ, kid, look out!

1233
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:59,234
- Over there!
- Yeah!

1234
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:00,475
- Ready?
- Yeah!

1235
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:06,674
Hudson!

1236
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:08,910
Yeah, all clear. Nailed the other one.

1237
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,513
It's history, man.

1238
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:12,709
Jesus!

1239
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:17,438
Burke. It was Burke.

1240
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:23,351
I say we grease this rat-fuck
son of a bitch right now.

1241
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:26,079
It just doesn't make any goddamn sense.

1242
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:32,828
He figured that he could get an alien
back through quarantine...

1243
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:35,758
...if one of us was impregnated.

1244
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,956
Whatever you call it.

1245
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:41,678
And then frozen for the trip home.

1246
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:45,912
Nobody would know about
the embryos we were carrying...

1247
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,672
...me and Newt.

1248
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:51,317
<i>Wait, now. We'd all know.</i>

1249
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:56,838
Yes. He could only do it by sabotaging
certain freezers on the way home.

1250
01:47:56,920 --> 01:47:58,319
Namely, yours.

1251
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:03,474
Then he could jettison the bodies
and make up any story he liked.

1252
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:05,710
Fuck! He's dead.

1253
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:08,951
You're dog meat, pal.

1254
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:14,191
This is so nuts. I mean, listen...
Listen to what you're saying.

1255
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:17,836
It's paranoid delusion. It's really sad.

1256
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:21,118
It's pathetic.

1257
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:24,237
Burke, I don't know which species is worse.

1258
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:28,108
They don't fuck each other over
for a goddamn percentage.

1259
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:31,192
All right, we waste him. No offence.

1260
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:33,191
No! He's got to go back...

1261
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,991
They cut the power.

1262
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:39,038
<i>How can they cut the power?
They're animals!</i>

1263
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:41,918
I want you two checking the corridors! Move!

1264
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,673
Gorman, watch Burke.
Newt, stay close.

1265
01:48:48,040 --> 01:48:51,032
- I'll go this side.
- You do that, man.

1266
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,553
<i>- Anything?
- There's something.</i>

1267
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:20,712
<i>It's inside the complex.</i>

1268
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,677
You're just reading me.

1269
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:25,513
<i>No, it ain't you.</i>

1270
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:30,830
They're inside the perimeter. They're in here.

1271
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:33,912
<i>Hudson, stay cool. Vasquez?</i>

1272
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:42,512
<i>Hudson may be right.</i>

1273
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:45,592
<i>- Get back, both of you.
- The signal's weird.</i>

1274
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:51,391
Must be some interference or something.
There's movement all over the place!

1275
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:54,711
Get back to Operations. It's game time.

1276
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:55,994
Newt.

1277
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:00,271
Seal the door.

1278
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:01,349
Hurry!

1279
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:04,637
<i>Come on! Come on, get back!</i>

1280
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:06,631
Work fast.

1281
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:12,877
Cover your eyes, Newt. Don't look at the light.

1282
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:17,158
Movement. Signal's clean. Range: 20 metres.

1283
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:19,913
They found a way in, something we missed.

1284
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,831
We didn't miss anything.

1285
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:23,512
18...

1286
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:25,511
17 metres.

1287
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:28,398
Something under the floor, not in the plans.

1288
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:29,993
- 15 metres.
- Ripley!

1289
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:31,957
Definitely inside the barricades.

1290
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:33,439
Let's go!

1291
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:39,437
- That's right outside the door. Get back!
- This is a big fuckin' signal.

1292
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:42,637
- How you doing, Vasquez?
- Almost there.

1293
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:45,639
That's it.

1294
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:48,078
12 metres.

1295
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:50,192
11...

1296
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:51,589
10...

1297
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:54,433
- They're right on us.
- 9 metres.

1298
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:57,717
- Remember, short controlled bursts.
- 8 metres.

1299
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:01,998
7...

1300
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:04,269
6...

1301
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:07,477
- That can't be!
- It's reading right, man!

1302
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:09,039
You're not reading it right.

1303
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:13,755
5 metres, man - 4!

1304
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:16,271
What the hell!

1305
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:21,910
- Oh, my God!
- Give me the light!

1306
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:41,198
There they go! Get 'em!

1307
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:45,720
- Come on!
- Get 'em!

1308
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:48,836
Do something, Gorman!

1309
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:53,557
<i>Look out! Look out!
There's more of 'em!</i>

1310
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:55,278
Get to medical!

1311
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:57,433
Do it! Now!

1312
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:59,511
<i>Hudson! Look out!</i>

1313
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:04,110
Aagh!

1314
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:05,829
Now!

1315
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:08,516
Burke!

1316
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:14,831
Open this door! Burke! Open it!

1317
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:16,470
Agh!

1318
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:19,034
Let's go! Let's go! Fall back!

1319
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:22,796
Go!

1320
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,713
Die, motherfucker!

1321
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:27,119
Burke!

1322
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:28,474
Hudson!

1323
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:30,634
Hudson!

1324
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:32,039
Motherfucker!

1325
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:34,759
Come on! Come on! Come and get it, baby!

1326
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:39,075
I don't got all day! Come on, you bastard!

1327
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:42,470
Come on, you too!
You want some of this? Fuck you!

1328
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:44,509
Aagh!

1329
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:46,837
Fuck you!

1330
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:49,199
- Hicks!
- Hudson!

1331
01:52:57,920 --> 01:52:59,319
Come on, Hicks!

1332
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:00,389
Go!

1333
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:01,833
<i>It's locked!</i>

1334
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:21,477
Got it! Let's go!

1335
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:23,235
Go! Go!

1336
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:26,988
Move, Gorman!

1337
01:53:27,080 --> 01:53:28,479
Seal it!

1338
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:30,669
Burke!

1339
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:33,035
Goddamn you! Open this door!

1340
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:45,757
Get back!

1341
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:48,195
- Hurry up!
- Gorman, get out of the way!

1342
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:50,271
- Ripley, this way!
- What?

1343
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:52,831
Wait. Get behind me.

1344
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:55,229
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast!

1345
01:53:58,120 --> 01:54:00,839
- Hicks!
- Come on, let's go!

1346
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:03,874
Move!

1347
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:12,993
- Which way to the landing field?
- This way.

1348
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:19,792
Go right!

1349
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:25,079
This way! This way.

1350
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:36,670
- Which way?
- Straight ahead and left.

1351
01:54:36,760 --> 01:54:39,991
Bishop, do you read me? Come in. Over.

1352
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:42,071
<i>The ship is on its way.</i>

1353
01:54:42,160 --> 01:54:45,118
ETA 16 minutes.

1354
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:47,873
Good! Stand by there! We're on our way!

1355
01:54:58,640 --> 01:55:00,710
- Which way now?
- That way.

1356
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:03,598
- No, wait! This way!
- Are you sure?

1357
01:55:05,080 --> 01:55:06,559
Vasquez, move!

1358
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:12,392
- Right up here! It's just up here!
- Hicks!

1359
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:14,471
We're almost there!

1360
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:17,031
Newt, wait!

1361
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:18,429
Newt!

1362
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:43,394
Vasquez!

1363
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:45,629
Go!

1364
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:50,113
Ohh! Ohh, no!

1365
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:03,149
Newt!

1366
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:06,471
Up there!
There's a short cut across the roof!

1367
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:08,549
Hicks!

1368
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:19,630
You always were an asshole, Gorman.

1369
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:38,391
<i>Newt!</i>

1370
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:40,789
- Ripley!
- Newt!

1371
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:44,717
Hicks! Hicks, get her! Hurry!

1372
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,230
Oh! Hold on, Newt!

1373
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:52,436
- I'm slipping!
- Don't let go!

1374
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:54,511
- Ripley!
- Hold on!

1375
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:56,511
- Help!
- Gotcha!

1376
01:56:57,480 --> 01:56:58,515
I gotcha!

1377
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,594
Newt! No!

1378
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:10,518
Come on! We can find her with this!

1379
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:12,113
Stay where you are, Newt!

1380
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:14,953
<i>- Ripley!
- We're coming!</i>

1381
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:28,190
Ripley!

1382
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:33,513
This way.

1383
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,797
She's close.

1384
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:38,632
Newt!

1385
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,991
Ripley!

1386
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:45,435
Where are you! Can you hear me!

1387
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:49,677
- Newt!
- Here! I'm here!

1388
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:50,829
Where?!

1389
01:57:55,640 --> 01:57:57,631
Newt, are you OK?

1390
01:57:57,720 --> 01:58:00,234
Gonna have to cut it.

1391
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:03,756
Climb down, honey.
We've got to cut through.

1392
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:12,475
Newt?

1393
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:15,358
Now don't move. Stay very still.

1394
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:17,715
OK.

1395
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:20,360
We're almost there. Hang in there, OK?

1396
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:28,957
Hicks! Hurry!

1397
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:30,473
- I know!
- I mean it!

1398
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:46,357
Newt, just stay still!

1399
01:58:50,240 --> 01:58:51,275
Aagh!

1400
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:53,157
- Almost there!
- No!

1401
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:56,549
Newt!

1402
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:10,390
<i>No! No!</i>

1403
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:12,869
- Let's go!
- No!

1404
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:16,358
They don't kill you!
They don't kill you! They...

1405
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:21,079
- She's alive! She's alive!
- All right! I believe you! She's alive!

1406
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:23,151
We've got to go! Now!

1407
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:54,029
Hicks...

1408
01:59:54,120 --> 01:59:55,838
Get it off!

1409
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:57,194
Aagh!

1410
01:59:57,280 --> 01:59:59,475
Get it off!

1411
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:00,993
Aagh!

1412

1413
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:14,269
Go!

1414
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:19,675
Come on, you can make it!

1415
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:45,032
Bishop! How much time?!

1416
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:47,076
Plenty! 26 minutes!

1417
02:00:47,160 --> 02:00:49,549
- We're not leaving!
- We're not?

1418
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:15,033
- Ripley...
- Bishop, she's alive. There's still time.

1419
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:18,430
In 19 minutes this area
is gonna be a cloud of vapour.

1420
02:02:18,520 --> 02:02:21,239
- Hicks, don't let him leave.
- We ain't going anywhere.

1421
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:26,518
- See you, Hicks.
- Dwayne.

1422
02:02:28,120 --> 02:02:29,269
It's Dwayne.

1423
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:32,797
Ellen.

1424
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:36,353
Don't be gone long, Ellen.

02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:25,239
Ripley!

1432
02:07:25,720 --> 02:07:26,914
Ripley!

1433
02:07:40,720 --> 02:07:42,870
Grab on to me!

1434
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:44,757
Hold on!

1435
02:11:26,200 --> 02:11:28,191
<i>Let's go!</i>

1436
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,389
Behind us!

1437
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:27,952
<i>Attention. Emergency.
All personnel must evacuate immediately.</i>

1438
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:36,356
<i>Attention. Emergency.
All personnel must evacuate immediately.</i>

1439
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:41,795
<i>You now have four minutes
to reach minimum safe distance.</i>

1440
02:12:56,920 --> 02:12:59,275
Come on, goddamn it!

1441
02:13:04,280 --> 02:13:06,271
Hold on to me!

1442
02:13:54,600 --> 02:13:59,594
<i>Attention. Emergency.
All personnel must evacuate immediately.</i>

1443
02:14:01,320 --> 02:14:05,029
<i>You now have two minutes
to reach minimum safe distance.</i>

1444
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:13,989
No!

1445
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:18,035
Bishop!

1446
02:14:18,120 --> 02:14:19,917
Goddamn you!

1447
02:15:21,120 --> 02:15:23,111
Close your eyes, baby.

1448
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:27,476
<i>Look!</i>

1449
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:35,991
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

1450
02:16:03,240 --> 02:16:04,559
Punch it, Bishop!

1451
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:49,989
It's OK.

1452
02:16:50,080 --> 02:16:51,672
<i>We're OK.</i>

1453
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:01,548
Hey.

1454
02:17:03,640 --> 02:17:05,631
We made it.

1455
02:17:05,800 --> 02:17:07,791
I knew you'd come.

1456
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:23,831
He's gonna be all right.

1457
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:27,390
He's just out. I had to give him
another shot for the pain.

1458
02:17:27,480 --> 02:17:30,358
We need a stretcher
to carry him up to medical.

1459
02:17:30,440 --> 02:17:32,032
OK.

1460
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:40,839
I'm sorry if I scared you.
That platform was becoming too unstable.

1461
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:44,913
I had to circle and hope that things
didn't get too rough to take you off.

1462
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:46,433
Bishop...

1463
02:17:47,240 --> 02:17:49,754
- You did OK.
- I did?

1464
02:17:49,840 --> 02:17:51,114
Oh, yeah.

1465
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:31,036
Go! Move!

1466
02:18:33,360 --> 02:18:36,432
No! Here! Here!

1467
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:38,431
Run!

1468
02:18:43,480 --> 02:18:45,038
Here!

1469
02:20:10,120 --> 02:20:12,315
Get away from her, you bitch!

1470
02:20:34,480 --> 02:20:36,914
Come on! Come on!

1471
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:42,749
Aagh!

1472
02:21:46,560 --> 02:21:47,197
Aagh!

1473
02:21:55,520 --> 02:21:56,157
Aagh!

1474
02:22:01,720 --> 02:22:02,630
Ripley!

1475
02:22:38,800 --> 02:22:40,916
Ohh!

1476
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:41,955
Aagh!

1477
02:23:12,560 --> 02:23:14,949
Bishop!

1478
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:01,795
- Mommy!
- Oh, God!

1479
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:08,272
Not bad for a... human.

1480
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:56,353
Are we gonna sleep all the way home?

1481
02:24:56,440 --> 02:24:57,839
All the way home.

1482
02:24:57,920 --> 02:24:59,319
Can I dream?

1483
02:25:01,320 --> 02:25:04,039
Yes, honey. I think we both can.

1484
02:25:11,360 --> 02:25:12,952
Sleep tight.

1485
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:14,632
Affirmative.

1486
02:25:17,632 --> 02:25:21,632
