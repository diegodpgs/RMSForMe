49
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,280
what's the proof that you got

50
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,321

51
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,290

we make programmes

54
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,457
to save computers from virus attacks

55
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:25,303
like we police officers protect
the citizens

56
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:30,339
anabh about to came back to London
after finishing his assignment

57

No phone calls

59
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,474
and anabh is not like that

60
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,292
they told me that anabh didn't came
there for assignment

61
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,362
he came there, i knew it

62
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,297
we used to talk everyday

63
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,526
he called me thousand times a day

64
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,397
and i scolded him that don't waste your
money in phone bills

65
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,464
i don't know why they are lying
to me

66
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:09,347
Case is complicated,
but i will try my best

67
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,379
it will take some time
but it will be done

68
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:17,250

69
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:23,461

75
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,319

It's just nearby

76
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,449
how do you feeling now?

77
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,486
You came first time in Calcutta

78
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,404
entire Calcutta is preparing
for festival

79
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,432
so you know about durga festival

80
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,377
my husband is bengali so i must
know that

81
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:51,374
your name is common bengali name

82
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,254
why they call you rana?

83
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,454
In calcutta everyone have 2 names

84
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,367
two different names for a
single person

85
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,309
different identities

86
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,392
hotel has come?

87
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,296
It doesn't looks like the hotel

88
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,277
are you sure it's the same place?
Address is same

89
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,478
why your husband would stay here

90
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,439
are you the manager?
Yes!

91
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:35,453
I have called you from london
regarding my husband

92
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,450
look! I am not a queen

93
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,363
when you called up from london

94
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:49,298
so i told you that your husband
was not here

95
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,367
you are saying the same thing

96
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,397
that's why i came here and i know

97
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,442
because he called me everyday
from here

98
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,472
there must be some confusion

99
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,382
anabh stood here

100
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,384
this man is lying
show me your records...

101
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,283
that's your records

102
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,484
you don't have computer

103
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,490
ma'am! Computers are only available
in five star hotels

104
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,323
this is guest house

105
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:32,309
if you will go to lift then there
is a peacock statue

106
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:35,437
abnav told me that tamil's peacock
is still behind me here

107
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,282
where is the lift?

108
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,447
But your husband is not here

109
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,291
i mean he was...
are you joking?

110
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,384
Peacock is really there
but how do you know that?

111
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,429
If abhnav didn't tell me then
how do i know

112
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,300
i don't know why everyone is
lying to me

113
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,328
abhnav didn't stay here but
i will stay here

114
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,498
i will stay in room no. 15.
Are you sure?

115
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,443
Give me the keys

116
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,425
why are you standing at the door
you took so long

117
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,361
i am waiting for you here since long
and your phone was also not reachable

118
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,301

00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:18,309
then i will wait for here

120
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,500
rain has started
now business is over

121
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,469
no hot water in my room i knew it

122
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,406
you knew it then why did you write
down on board running hot water

123
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:18,320
you need hot water then call vishnu

124
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,375
don't ask him that's radio

125
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,278
his life...
he will never give you that

126
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,511
you called me sister so
you are my brother

127
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,245
call mrs. Vidya bagchi

128
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,355
do you have an appointment?
Yeah!

129
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:48,342
Your husband didn't came to my company
for any assignment

130
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:50,445
i am h. r. Manager

131
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,482
i approve every assignment

132
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:58,353
and i didn't sanctioned any assignment
for abhnav bakhsi...

133
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:07,402
employee records are in old office

134
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,274
perhaps his photo is there

135
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,314
just look milind's photo once
then decide

136
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,496
you can't do a single job

137
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,465
you can't bring a single client
for life insurance

138
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:46,310
if it will keep running like that

139
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:48,344
then sooner you will be fired
from this job

140
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,283
switch off your phone and pay
attention on your targets

141
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,309
you will have to go Calcutta
right now

142
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:31,441
someone has shot n. d. O's h. R manager

143
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:35,315
that's local police station case

144
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,387
why you must have to go Calcutta

145
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:39,421
they want to open milind's record

146
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,426

147
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,297
Some pregnant woman came from london

148
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,306

you shouldn't smoke in
front of me

154
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,276
we don't know about each other

155
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,280

156
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,281

00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:05,275
But who are you?

163
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:12,282
Close the door

00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:18,319
so what were you saying?

165
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:23,315
Who is he?

166
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:26,386
Abnav's face is familiar to their
ex-employee

167
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:30,295
but there was no employee milind there

168
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,293
i think agnus doesn't know anything

169
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:39,401
because i remember she told
me his name milind

170
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:46,347
i know about n. d. O better than you
and agnus

171
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:48,340
2000 people worked there

172
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,392
actually she also told me that...

173
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:59,394
when she was trying to access
milind's records

174
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,431
then it was...
you are not listening to me

175
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:04,343
there was no file of milind

176
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:07,381
milind exists and who is milind

177
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:14,330
where did you find this paper

178
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:15,465
who cares?

179
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:17,527
Who is milind?
Is he your husband?

180
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:20,332
Look at to him carefully

181
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,437
is he your husband

182
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:24,373
no!

183
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:27,376
Then who cares that who is he?

184
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:31,437
Forget milind and i will also forget
that where did you find this paper

185
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,340
milind is not abhnav

186
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:36,376
but he looks like abhnav

187
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:39,455
and for this reason something
happened to my husband

188
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:42,492
that's important for me to know that
who is milind

189
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:45,485
rather you tell me

190
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:48,331
or leave it to me

191
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:51,332
i will find the answer and come
back to you

192
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:54,461
how would you find out?

193
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,434
I will go outside and ask everyone

194
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:04,405
rather he is the common man

195
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:06,282
police...

196
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,318
or media...

197
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:13,289
somebody will must have the answer
of this question

198
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:17,493
sit!

199
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,504
Two years back that
Calcutta metro attack

200
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,339
do you know something about that

201
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,278
milind was involved in that attack

202
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:37,343
he is the prime suspect in this case

203
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:43,283
then why nobody knows about milind

204
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:45,318
milind doesn't exist for the people

205
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,418
when i have been told to arrest him

206
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,453
but till then it was too late

207
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:56,431
milind was disappeared along
with his records

208
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,289
but how somebody could disappeared

209
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:01,427
milind was a federal agent

210
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:03,294
he met with the enemies

211
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,374
we have been hiding this issue
from the public

212
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:09,403
there is someone inside our system
who is helping milind

213
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:12,440
this is really a dangerous game

214
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:19,388
milind's protectors are very powerful
they can do anything

215
00:54:58,185 --> 00:54:59,152
are you alright?

216
00:54:59,186 --> 00:55:01,120
Thank god i saved you today

217
00:55:02,255 --> 00:55:03,279
but if i wouldn't save you tomorrow

218
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:10,118
i will pray to god that you and your
baby should be fine

219
00:55:18,138 --> 00:55:20,231
anything could happen here

220
00:55:22,275 --> 00:55:23,299
go back!

221
00:55:36,056 --> 00:55:37,114
I don't wanna come back

222
00:55:37,324 --> 00:55:39,315
keep your bureau and your system

223
00:55:40,327 --> 00:55:43,160
only one project was failed

224
00:55:43,296 --> 00:55:45,264
it means we should close the bureau

225
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:47,292
we should shut down the system
only one project?

226
00:55:49,135 --> 00:55:51,069
You can say very easily

227
00:55:52,172 --> 00:55:54,140
you gave me this assignment

228
00:55:55,141 --> 00:55:58,235
ohoose 3 people train them and make
them best bureau agent

229
00:55:59,145 --> 00:56:00,169
and what have i done?

230
00:56:03,149 --> 00:56:04,116
I have got 2 nice people

231
00:56:04,217 --> 00:56:06,151
but i have trained mutant like milind

232
00:56:06,286 --> 00:56:09,255
and he sold him up to those people from
whom he have to save us

233
00:56:10,123 --> 00:56:13,092
for those civilians i trained him

234
00:56:13,193 --> 00:56:15,161
he killed those civilians

235
00:56:15,295 --> 00:56:17,195
we will find milind

236
00:56:17,264 --> 00:56:20,131
you come back
you can't find milind

237
00:56:21,334 --> 00:56:23,165
i have trained him

238
00:56:25,138 --> 00:56:27,231
they can find only stupid people
like us

239
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,240
who is shouting for nothing

240
00:56:29,342 --> 00:56:31,242
that our system is perfect

241
00:56:33,146 --> 00:56:35,205
there is no corruption in our system

242
00:56:41,221 --> 00:56:44,122
one person helped milind to escape

243
00:56:45,158 --> 00:56:48,286
that person is still working
in your bureau

244
00:56:50,163 --> 00:56:51,187
the day you will find him

245
00:56:52,198 --> 00:56:53,256
i will come back that day

246
00:57:06,146 --> 00:57:07,204
three things could be happen

247
00:57:10,183 --> 00:57:12,117
anbhav left me

248
00:57:16,256 --> 00:57:18,315
anbhav and milind are same person

249
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,187
anbhav's face is familiar to milind and
that's why he is in trouble

250
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,292
so you are saying that...

251
00:57:29,302 --> 00:57:32,100
anbhav's face is familiar to milind...
i am sure

252
00:57:32,305 --> 00:57:34,273
we will have to find milind to
get anbhav

253
00:57:35,175 --> 00:57:36,233
and the day we will find milind

254
00:57:37,143 --> 00:57:38,167
that day we will anbhav too

255
00:57:39,245 --> 00:57:41,145
how is that possible

256
00:57:41,247 --> 00:57:44,080
how we will find that person
from his house

257
00:57:45,318 --> 00:57:48,082
i have seen milind's address in
agnus file

258
00:59:03,296 --> 00:59:05,230
oan you climb up?
Yes

259
00:59:28,154 --> 00:59:30,145
here it is but it's closed

260
00:59:37,163 --> 00:59:38,152
officer is breaking the lock

261
00:59:40,166 --> 00:59:41,155
you have said it

262
00:59:59,219 --> 01:00:02,120
i don't know what was the need
to lock this place

263
01:00:02,222 --> 01:00:03,211
nothing is here

264
01:00:04,124 --> 01:00:07,093
and if there was something then
that company would have got it

265
01:00:11,264 --> 01:00:13,198
let's go back from here

266
01:00:14,234 --> 01:00:15,292
i will see once

267
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:26,110
don't do it over and over again

268
01:00:26,146 --> 01:00:28,171
we will must f'ind something

269
01:00:43,329 --> 01:00:46,298
did you see only flat no.3 letter
box was not there

270
01:00:53,173 --> 01:00:55,198
do you have any letter for flat no.3

271
01:00:56,142 --> 01:00:57,109
i have one

272
01:01:21,134 --> 01:01:23,193
milind used to order tea from here
they might have told us something

273
01:01:24,137 --> 01:01:25,104
how do you know?

274
01:01:26,139 --> 01:01:28,107
You gave me the tea in same glass

275
01:01:31,144 --> 01:01:33,112
remember same glasses were
in milind's house

276
01:01:33,146 --> 01:01:35,114
and there was no kitchen in
milind's house

277
01:01:41,254 --> 01:01:44,121
are you scared?
He is my friend

278
01:01:44,324 --> 01:01:46,087
what's your name?

279
01:01:55,134 --> 01:01:58,103
Tell me do you know something
about flat no.3

280
01:02:01,307 --> 01:02:04,105
what kind of man he was?

281
01:02:04,244 --> 01:02:07,077
When you went to give him tea

282
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:08,238
so did he smile on you

283
01:02:09,182 --> 01:02:10,240
did he talk to you?

284
01:02:11,117 --> 01:02:13,085
He didn't talk anything but...

285
01:02:13,319 --> 01:02:15,184
he always order one cup of tea

286
01:02:18,324 --> 01:02:21,225
sometimes another person had come
so he ordered two cup of tea

287
01:02:23,129 --> 01:02:24,118
who is another man?

288
01:02:25,131 --> 01:02:26,189
He always brought a suit case

289
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:39,169
when you smile you look
so handsome

290
01:02:41,114 --> 01:02:44,083
you can win any kid's heart

291
01:02:45,118 --> 01:02:46,176
i am sure...
what?

292
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:49,085
That you will be a good mother

293
01:03:05,204 --> 01:03:08,071
agnus told me that milind's blood
group was very rare

294
01:03:10,243 --> 01:03:14,202
if somebody have rare blood group so
he store his blood in our department

295
01:03:15,148 --> 01:03:18,140
so if there is any emergency so he
could use his blood

296
01:03:20,153 --> 01:03:22,178
in this case when did you need this
blood last time

297
01:03:22,322 --> 01:03:24,085
oan you check?

298
01:03:30,263 --> 01:03:35,098
In 25th may 2008 we needed this
blood group

299
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:45,234
not a single paper

300
01:03:46,112 --> 01:03:47,101
no record, nothing

301
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,249
there will be but it's disappeared like
every milind's link

302
01:03:52,185 --> 01:03:54,119
shop is closed here

303
01:03:56,122 --> 01:03:57,111
there must be something

304
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:59,158
i am not gonna give up

305
01:04:00,126 --> 01:04:01,184
you have always supported me

306
01:04:01,294 --> 01:04:03,285
i can't go further without your help

307
01:04:09,135 --> 01:04:11,126
there is a man who could help us

308
01:04:11,237 --> 01:04:13,137
in old times he was a police informer

309
01:16:21,133 --> 01:16:23,101
bob biswas was a contract killer

310
01:16:23,235 --> 01:16:25,260
it's his phone and we have found
these photos from his phone

311
01:16:31,043 --> 01:16:32,101
and you are the next

312
01:16:32,277 --> 01:16:34,268
this time you survived but that person
who hired bob

313
01:16:35,114 --> 01:16:36,274
who doesn't want that anyone could
lead to milind

314
01:16:37,149 --> 01:16:38,241
i gave this photo to agnus...

315
01:16:46,158 --> 01:16:47,182
iook at this!

316
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:50,094
I gave this photo copy to agnus

317
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:53,223
it means who gave contract to bob he
is working in n. d. O

318
01:16:54,266 --> 01:16:57,133
it means whatever i said you did
not listen

319
01:16:57,269 --> 01:16:59,066
and you are not trying to understand

320
01:16:59,204 --> 01:17:01,172
your life is in danger

321
01:17:01,273 --> 01:17:04,071
and i will have to inform khan...
did you f'ind mr. Briefcase name?

322
01:17:06,278 --> 01:17:09,145
He is in i. T department and tyagi
reports him

323
01:17:15,154 --> 01:17:17,088
we were thinking that tyagi is
doing everything

324
01:17:17,322 --> 01:17:20,189
but tyagi was just giving information

325
01:17:20,292 --> 01:17:22,226
we have no proof of that

326
01:17:23,162 --> 01:17:24,094
let's go to police

327
01:17:25,164 --> 01:17:26,256
that phone is my evidence

328
01:17:29,268 --> 01:17:30,166
look at this

329
01:17:30,269 --> 01:17:32,260
bob got this message from
some web site

330
01:17:35,174 --> 01:17:37,142
once i will hack this website

331
01:17:37,242 --> 01:17:39,107
then we will know from whose computer
this message was sent

332
01:17:43,282 --> 01:17:46,080
are you hacker?
Only for spare time

333
01:17:47,152 --> 01:17:48,278

334
01:18:01,166 --> 01:18:03,134

335
01:18:03,202 --> 01:18:05,136
where these photos has been uploaded

336
01:18:05,204 --> 01:18:08,230

337
01:18:09,141 --> 01:18:11,166
and once it wil be confirm then we
will find milind

338
01:18:13,178 --> 01:18:14,270
that matter is really serious

339
01:18:15,113 --> 01:18:16,205
and i am still telling you that we
should go to police

340
01:18:16,281 --> 01:18:18,078
we don't have much time

341
01:18:18,283 --> 01:18:21,252
mr. Briefcase will know soon that
bob is dead

342
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,254
and he will try to remove all
the records

343
01:18:25,123 --> 01:18:27,091
i have to access shiver's computer once

344
01:18:27,159 --> 01:18:29,093
then we will go to police

345
01:18:34,132 --> 01:18:35,190
do you think death is a joke

346
01:18:38,237 --> 01:18:40,228
i have told you many times

347
01:18:41,173 --> 01:18:42,231
your life is in danger

348
01:18:44,309 --> 01:18:46,174
you have seen it from your eyes

349
01:18:47,212 --> 01:18:49,180
after that you are joking
with your death

350
01:18:53,285 --> 01:18:55,310
because after abhnav

351
01:18:57,155 --> 01:18:59,123
life has become a joke for me

352
01:19:19,177 --> 01:19:20,109
you didn't go yet

353
01:19:20,245 --> 01:19:23,078

veneration

354
01:19:23,148 --> 01:19:24,172

355
01:19:30,155 --> 01:19:32,180

01:19:33,191 --> 01:19:35,216

357
01:19:51,310 --> 01:19:53,141

360
01:21:58,203 --> 01:22:00,068

361
01:22:00,138 --> 01:22:02,106
one man and woman came with her

362
01:22:03,141 --> 01:22:04,165
close all the door

363
01:22:04,309 --> 01:22:06,140
don't let anyone out

364
01:22:18,156 --> 01:22:20,317
is somebody downstairs?
No!

365
01:22:27,132 --> 01:22:30,124
That back door is open where
people smokes

366
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:29,260
we are leaving from back door but
somebody is following us

367
01:23:31,129 --> 01:23:32,187
please come fast.

368
01:23:33,131 --> 01:23:35,156
What happen?
I have to call mr. Khan

369
01:24:37,128 --> 01:24:38,095
this man can't die

370
01:24:40,265 --> 01:24:42,130
we needed this man alive...

371
01:35:42,126 --> 01:35:43,252
we will have to stop this operation

372
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:46,255
if milind will meet bagchi then her
life is in danger

373
01:35:47,131 --> 01:35:48,120
you didn't understand

374
01:35:48,332 --> 01:35:51,130
milind doesn't spare any eye witness
and this time he won't spare her

375
01:35:52,236 --> 01:35:55,103
so we will try to protect your bagchi

376
01:35:58,142 --> 01:36:00,167
you know and you...
we are scarifying her

377
01:36:01,178 --> 01:36:02,202
this is very wrong

378
01:36:04,148 --> 01:36:05,274
you will teach me what is right
and wrong

379
01:36:06,183 --> 01:36:07,207
my job is to protect this country

380
01:36:07,285 --> 01:36:09,253
and everything is right whatever
i have to do for that

381
01:36:10,154 --> 01:36:13,317
if i will have to sacrify bagchi to
arrest milind

382
01:36:14,292 --> 01:36:17,261
then what's the difference between
milind and us? Nothing...

383
01:36:19,196 --> 01:36:21,164
we are working for law and he
is against the law

384
01:36:22,066 --> 01:36:23,260
that's why we are right
and he is wrong

385
01:36:26,203 --> 01:36:27,227
love is good thing

386
01:36:27,338 --> 01:36:29,135
but learn it to use on right place

387
01:36:31,142 --> 01:36:35,238
that love is telling you to tell
vidya about khan

388
01:36:36,147 --> 01:36:37,114
it's wrong

389
01:36:38,115 --> 01:36:39,275
you can save only one life with that

390
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:41,318
and what about those thousand lives
what milind will destroy

391
01:36:43,154 --> 01:36:44,246
i was not going to tell her

392
01:36:45,122 --> 01:36:46,180
take his mobile

393
01:36:46,324 --> 01:36:49,088
don't let him go anywhere not
even bathroom

394
01:38:39,170 --> 01:38:42,139
are you sherma?
Khan is calling you

395
01:38:47,311 --> 01:38:49,176
he told me to stay here

396
01:39:34,325 --> 01:39:35,257
sir!
Where is rana?

397
01:39:47,271 --> 01:39:50,138
Where is bagchi?
She just check out...

398
01:43:04,301 --> 01:43:07,099
she is just a story,
i don't have much time

399
01:43:08,205 --> 01:43:10,105
if you want your husband back

400
01:43:12,276 --> 01:43:16,144
if i will return the papers so
you will return me my husband

401
01:43:22,252 --> 01:43:23,219
Can you return it?

402
01:43:25,189 --> 01:43:26,156
Think about it...

403
01:45:41,124 --> 01:45:42,113
who cares?

404
01:47:16,153 --> 01:47:19,122
Who was this bagchi?
She was a mystery

405
01:47:36,206 --> 01:47:39,266
where did you find this shirt?
That's my school uniform

406
01:47:58,228 --> 01:48:00,219
check her hotel room and her
finger print,

407
01:48:10,207 --> 01:48:12,141
and her husband?

408
01:48:12,275 --> 01:48:14,140
So you didn't understand yet...

409
01:48:15,245 --> 01:48:17,110
you narrated her a story in
the beginning

410
01:48:20,150 --> 01:48:21,310
and she narrated you a story
in the beginning

411
01:48:27,257 --> 01:48:30,226
milind was existed
but there is not vidya...

412
01:48:31,161 --> 01:48:32,128
and nor any abhnav

413
01:48:32,195 --> 01:48:34,095
whose face is familiar to milind

414
01:48:46,109 --> 01:48:47,098
she was using us

415
01:48:48,211 --> 01:48:52,238
i think vidya has been hired to
find and kill milnd

416
01:48:53,150 --> 01:48:55,209
and she used us to get milind

417
01:48:56,186 --> 01:49:00,122
she wanted us to sacrify her
to get milind

418
01:49:00,190 --> 01:49:03,250
before we could arrest sheetal
vidya also killed her

419
01:49:04,194 --> 01:49:07,220
you have put bhaskar and milind
in her custody

420
01:49:07,330 --> 01:49:08,228
she knew that...

421
01:49:08,298 --> 01:49:10,266
nobody is scared from pregnant woman

422
01:49:13,103 --> 01:49:14,263
you needed proof against bhaskar

423
01:49:35,292 --> 01:49:37,123
but who sent her?

424
01:51:15,292 --> 01:51:18,125
He must be proud on you

425
01:51:19,262 --> 01:51:23,164
because what you have done today non
of us could do that

426
01:51:27,037 --> 01:51:28,163
may i tell you one strange thing

427
01:51:30,140 --> 01:51:31,198
since last few days...

428
01:51:32,242 --> 01:51:34,176
i have forgotten that
i am not pregnant

429
01:51:36,213 --> 01:51:37,271
i felt that...

430
01:51:39,282 --> 01:51:41,147
my kid is alive inside me...

431
01:51:48,091 --> 01:51:49,149
i will find aroop somewhere...

432
01:51:54,264 --> 01:51:56,255
i can't live without them

433
01:51:58,134 --> 01:52:00,102
i want my aroop back

434
01:52:01,204 --> 01:52:04,105
i want my kid back...
