1
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,315
<i>- Hurry up! Jump in!
- There was a girl with them.</i>

2
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,597
<i>- Jump in, will you?
- Kind of lost.</i>

3
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,194
<i>You look kind of lost yourself.</i>

4
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,469
<i>- I think I know where she'll be.
- Come on. It's your last chance.</i>

5
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,990
<i>Wolfgang.</i>

6
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,470
<i>Wake up, Wolfgang. Come on.</i>

7
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,993
<i>Wake up!</i>

8
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,752
<i>Wolfgang!</i>

9
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,711
<i>Wolfgang!</i>

10
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,956
Jesus Christ.

11
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,954
Ben, it's three o'clock in the morning.
This better be good.

12
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,554
<i>I just had one of those dreams again.</i>

13
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,748
I was flying. It was so real. It was over
this giant circuit board or something.

14
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,879
I dreamt I was naked at school.
I hid in the bathroom. It was terrible.

15
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,034
Anyway, I drew what I could remember.
I'd like you to look at it tomorrow.

16
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,239
Sure. Can I go back to bed, please?

17
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,960
My mom's coming in to me.
Over and out.

18
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,795
<i>The Martians have no resistance
to bacteria in our atmosphere.</i>

19
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,076
<i>We have long since become immune.</i>

20
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,117
<i>Once they breathed our air,</i>

21
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,556
<i>germs which no longer affect us
began to kill them.</i>

22
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,679
<i>The end came swiftly.
All over the world, their machines...</i>

23
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,991
- Kick his ass, man.
- Go on, kill him.

24
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,916
- Get him.
- Heard you called me something funny.

25
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,071
What's so funny?

26
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,830
I said you had elephantitis.

27
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,719
Why can't you talk
like everybody else?

28
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,189
I don't like people calling me stuff
when I don't know what it is.

29
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,358
Elephantitis is when something gets
bloated and ugly, like your ass.

30
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,957
- You don't learn, do you?
- Cut it out, Jackson.

31
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,236
Who's gonna make me? You?

32
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,072
Sure, elephantitis head.

33
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,593
Kick his ass.

34
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,114
Kick his ass!

35
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,269
Come on! You can't get away
from us now, buddy.

36
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,671
Go, go, go, go!

37
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,233
Hey. Everything OK?

38
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,996
This damn carburettor.
Must've rebuilt this thing 100 times.

39
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,153
I wanted to say thanks for...
with Jackson and everything today.

40
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,633
Steve Jackson's a jerk.
If he tries it again, I'll kick his butt.

41
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,793
Want to come to my house?
I just got a tape of "This Island Earth".

42
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,997
- It's got this great saucer landing.
- Sounds great

43
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,315
And it's got this big mutant with two
brains. It's really cool. You'd like it.

44
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,954
Darren! Darren, wait up!

45
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,792
How come you didn't stop?

46
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,559
Look, why don't you just take off, OK?
I did you a favour.

47
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,953
- But I didn't know you'd bug me about it.
- It's OK. Here, forget it.

48
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,390
Oh, no. My dad's home.

49
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,591
- I guess he didn't get that job.
- What does he do?

50
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,109
Hauls junk.

51
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,994
Is that your mom?

52
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,516
No. That's my dad's girlfriend.

53
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,830
She's OK.

54
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,309
I think I will go over to your house.

55
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,597
OK, but leave your bike here.
We'll take the creek.

56
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,276
- Your folks fight a lot?
- My mom died when I was a kid.

57
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,390
My dad's OK.

58
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,240
He just isn't very lucky.

59
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,075
He always breaks things or loses 'em.

60
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,119
Anyway, he taught me how to run.

61
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,475
He can't catch me any more.

62
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,237
- Your mom and dad still together?
- Yeah. They get along OK.

63
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,075
They just talk about the stupidest junk
all the time.

64
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,152
- Where are we going?
- To see my friend Wolfgang.

65
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,598
- Wolfgang?
- His parents won't let him change it.

66
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,276
- You'll probably think he's weird anyway.
- Probably.

67
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,719
He's been playing sick, working on
a project. I want to see how it's going.

68
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,758
If I had a name like Wolfgang,
I'd kill myself.

69
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,473
Benjamin! Come in. And this is?

70
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,076
- Darren.
- Darren.

71
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,515
You only have to tell me once.
I never forget anything.

72
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,915
- Look, this looks like Uncle Fred.
- So it does.

73
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,514
Stop that right now!

74
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,117
Have a seat. Wolfgang's down in his lab.
I'll ring him.

75
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,158
He's feeling much better now.

76
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,153
<i>- Wolfgang.
- Yes, Mother.</i>

77
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,552
Benjamin is here with his friend Derek.

78
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,315
- Have you seen the bug bomb?
- I think it's in the bedroom.

79
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,233
Can I offer you anything?
Some baklava?

80
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,436
- Oh, sure.
- What?

81
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,957
It's Greek pastry. Try some.

82
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,673
- Geek pastry?
- No, Greek. It's pretty good.

83
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,314
- Is the bug bomb in the basement?
- I don't know.

84
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,869
- Where is the bug bomb?
- Hey.

85
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,071
- Who's he?
- He saved my life today.

86
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,753
Darren.

87
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,115
- Steve Jackson.
- OK.

88
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,793
- Finished it.
- You did?

89
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,678
- I sure did.
- Come on.

90
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,274
Oh, could you please shut the door?

91
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,989
- Help. Mom!
- Frieda. Here's more.

92
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,189
It's crazy, but your diagram translates
into some kind of circuit board.

93
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,677
Down, Erhart. Down.

94
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,751
This is Heinlein. Hello, Heinlein.

95
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,196
<i>Hello. Hello. Hello.</i>

96
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,194
<i>I want my... cheese.</i>

97
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,674
I put these sentences
into his voice synthesizer.

98
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,799
- Sometimes they make sense.
- It smells down here.

99
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,155
<i>- Not now, Heinlein.
- Go to hell.</i>

100
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,313
- Don't bother me. I'll turn your voice off.
- That's a good one.

101
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,519
All of these are mine.
My dad thinks I threw them away.

102
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,513
It's weird. I never could get into this stuff.

103
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,028
But don't you wonder what's out there?
Up in the universe? On other planets?

104
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,792
You believe everything
you see in the movies?

105
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,916
Not everything.

106
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,752
There's nobody out there.

107
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,275
- Here it is.
- Great.

108
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,199
I tied into my father's computer and
filled in some details on your drawing.

109
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,749
Mostly guesswork.

110
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,878
This is our circuit board,
which called for a terminal.

111
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,555
So I used my computer,
which is only a 128K,

112
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,748
but that should be enough to find out...
what it does, if it does anything at all,

113
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:32,040
which it... which it probably doesn't,
so...

114
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,953
- You got it?
- Makes sense to me.

115
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,078
Good. There's no sense in waiting.
Are you ready?

116
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,596
- Sure. I guess.
- It'll probably just burn out.

117
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:58,319
Oh, well. This kind of stuff usually takes
years to develop and work out the bugs.

118
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,474
What's... What's it doing?

119
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,315
I don't get it. It's programming itself.

120
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,556
I don't believe this. It's asking for
coordinates on X, Y and Z axes.

121
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,269
To locate a point in space
relative to its terminal.

122
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,795
How did you dream this?

123
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,991
- I guess I'm just that kind of guy.
- Let's see what happens.

124
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,068
Confirm.

125
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,751
- What was that?
- I have no idea.

126
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,876
There's holes in all these.

127
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,272
I can see through there.
This was from my dream?

128
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,797
Calm down. There's got to be
a logical explanation, a scientific reason.

129
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,269
This is a trick, right, you guys?

130
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,795
Listen, we have got to swear to secrecy.

131
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,839
If someone finds out,
they'll take it away from us. They can't.

132
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,151
You dreamt it, I built it. It's our secret.

133
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,151
- Right?
- Right.

134
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,073
You pull this on every sucker
that comes here?

135
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,949
<i>- Wolfgang!
- Oh, it's my father.</i>

136
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,999
Wolfgang, I was sure the bug bomb was
down here somewhere.

137
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,310
Insect by-products are...

138
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,552
- Hello. So this is the new experiment?
- Yeah.

139
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,551
- How's it going?
- Fine.

140
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,191
With all this equipment...
Is that my video sync generator?

141
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,476
No, I seriously doubt it, Father.

142
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,517
<i>- Hello, Heinlein.
- Don't you dare.</i>

143
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,470
- Shut up, Heinlein.
- I saw some insect waste over there.

144
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,519
And there could be some bug bomb.
Yeah, of course.

145
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,877
- It was definitely in that corner.
- Are you sure?

146
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,432
I have to get it running again.
I'll call tonight.

147
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,989
Don't forget. Goodnight, Mr Müller.

148
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,799
<i>- Ja, ja.
- Ah, Father.</i>

149
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,679
<i>Now I come to think of it,
maybe it's not...</i>

150
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,116
<i>Frieda, swat them
with the broom?</i>

151
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,156
<i>Our speed is diminishing.
We're now in the atmosphere of Earth.</i>

152
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,276
<i>Where are you going?</i>

153
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,479
<i>Our universe is vast, full of wonders.</i>

154
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,029
<i>I'll explore.</i>

155
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,274
<i>Perhaps find another Metaluna. A place
inhabited by beings not unlike myself.</i>

156
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,391
<i>You see, I'm more adventurous
than you imagine me.</i>

157
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,633
<i>Exeter, you've used all your power
bringing us here.</i>

158
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,951
<i>Even if you had a place to go,
you couldn't make it.</i>

159
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,874
<i>Come with us. We'll heal your wounds.</i>

160
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,556
<i>- My wounds can never be healed.
- You've things to teach us.</i>

161
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,639
<i>Ben.</i>

162
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,119
Yeah?

163
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,717
<i>I got it working again. Everybody's
at the movies. Get over here.</i>

164
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,519
- Well, what is it?
- Jeez!

165
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,389
You're such an obsessive person
and that drives me crazy.

166
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:31,714
Because you can't get emotional if you're
going to study anything scientifically.

167
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,952
What we have here,
as near as I can tell,

168
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,476
is an electrically-generated
point of force.

169
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,757
By typing in coordinates,
I can make it move anywhere,

170
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,118
even as far as slamming it
through a few books or a brick wall.

171
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,872
How?

172
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,197
- This is a vector graphic of the lab.
- You mean a drawing?

173
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,158
Yes, but in technical terms,
it's a vector graphic.

174
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,719
OK.

175
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,559
- That's where it'll be.
- Where?

176
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,919
You mean in physical form?
It's right there, somewhere.

177
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,399
I can't see it.

178
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,319
Sorry, I miscalculated it.

179
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,469
- I can't see it.
- Oh, yeah. I'll fix that.

180
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,435
- It's pretty neat, huh?
- Wow.

181
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,511
Yeah.

182
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,877
Here. I waited for you to get here
so we could make the official document.

183
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,199
- Can I touch it?
- Go ahead.

184
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,874
- It's pretty solid.
- Yeah.

185
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,350
- How come we can see it now?
- Power modulation.

186
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,433
See? This variable changes its diameter.

187
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,279
See? It's a perfect sphere.

188
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,954
- Want to see it move?
- Yeah.

189
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,271
We'll move it from here to there.

190
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,194
Boy, this is pretty weird.

191
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,799
- You sure you know what you're doing?
- Ben, I'm a scientist.

192
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,359
Wow!

193
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,996
Oh, my God!

194
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,150
- What the hell's going on in there?
- Get in here.

195
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,597
It's that thing we found. It's going crazy.

196
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,069
- You guys are kidding?
- Oh, no.

197
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,389
It's destroying the neighbourhood.
Get it back in here.

198
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,949
I've tried, OK, I've already tried.

199
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,714
- Can you see it?
- I don't see anything.

200
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,677
Get it back in here.

201
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,438
<i>Help! Help! Help!</i>

202
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,073
Damn.

203
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,550
- It's gone.
- So's most of the basement.

204
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,000
- Look at this mess.
- Oh, no.

205
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,879
- What now?
- It's my parents, they're back.

206
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,112
If my dad sees this,
he'll stuff me in a test tube.

207
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,035
You guys, sneak out the back,
and we'll continue testing tomorrow, OK?

208
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,439
Bad kitty.

209
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,316
- What did you tell him?
- It was a rocketry experiment.

210
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,995
I just mentioned Wernher von Braun
and everything was OK.

211
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,515
That wouldn't have worked at my house.

212
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,072
My brother and I
used to come up here all the time.

213
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,110
That was before
he went into his jerk phase.

214
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,798
Boy, you can see the whole town
from up here.

215
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,030
There's Lori's house.

216
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,792
Who's Lori?

217
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,110
She's this gorgeous blonde.

218
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,078
- Where does she live?
- Never mind.

219
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,073
I made a rough sketch of the terrain
in graphics mode for referencing.

220
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,754
I'll look for something
to experiment with.

221
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,832
Ben, don't touch.

222
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,676
Mr Professor.

223
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,752
It's my dream. I can touch it if I want.

224
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,151
- Is he always like this?
- Just about.

225
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,949
It doesn't make him so intelligent
just because he has a computer.

226
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,556
I can do it. I mean, it's not that tough.

227
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,073
That's where it's gonna
be when it comes on.

228
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,832
- Can you make it bigger?
- Sure.

229
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,914
- How do you make it come on?
- Like this.

230
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,791
- I didn't know it could get that big.
- Me neither.

231
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,077
Turn it off, man. Get him out of there.

232
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,550
- Come on!
- I'm trying. It's just not working.

233
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,952
<i>Ben, turn it off!</i>

234
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,878
Help!

235
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,113
Where's it going?

236
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,314
This is like
"Journey to the Centre of the Earth".

237
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,313
He's on his way to China!

238
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,717
Wolfgang! God, man, I'm sorry.

239
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,075
Are you all right?

240
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,233
Are you OK? I didn't mean to turn it on.
It just came on.

241
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,712
- I couldn't breathe in that thing.
- What was it like?

242
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,351
It was airtight. I couldn't feel myself
speed up or slow down.

243
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,640
Do you know what this means?
Do you realise what it means?

244
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,119
No.

245
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,353
<i>"Trägheitslosigkeit".
That's German for "no inertia".</i>

246
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,158
- No?
- Inertia.

247
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:25,034
If we had something to sit in, all three
of us could fly around in this thing.

248
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,510
We could look on top of the girls' gym.

249
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,234
I have got a great idea.

250
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,594
Oh, no. Ben, no.

251
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,431
Are you serious?

252
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,750
<i>A little higher.</i>

253
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,515
<i>That's it. I can almost see in.</i>

254
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,396
<i>Oh, my God. There she is.</i>

255
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,835
She won't be undressing this early.

256
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,755
<i>She's talking on the phone
and she's eating some...</i>

257
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,912
<i>It looks like Boston Cream Pie.</i>

258
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,230
<i>She's got stuffed animals on her bed</i>

259
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,311
<i>and some
Thompson Twins records.</i>

260
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,677
He's got it bad.

261
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,558
Idiotic.

262
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,996
<i>I can almost read her lips.
Get me closer.</i>

263
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,714
<i>Quick, she'll see me. Get me down.</i>

264
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,199
Here she comes.

265
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,838
Who is that?

266
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,550
Is that you, Ben?

267
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,077
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

268
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,708
What are you doing down there?

269
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,198
I saw a cat in your tree,
so I thought I'd get it down.

270
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,191
She wants me. I know she does.

271
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,033
Once we get this built,
how fast will it go?

272
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,716
Lmagine being in a car and accelerating
from 0-90 in less than a second.

273
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,396
You'd be instantly squished.
But in this force field you have no inertia.

274
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,551
No resistance to acceleration.

275
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,792
You can start, speed up,
stop without slowing down,

276
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,633
and, basically, you won't get squished.

277
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,555
- How fast?
- It depends on the power you put in.

278
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:29,078
To give you an idea, this is the amount
of power I'm putting in right now.

279
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,393
Who's Roger?

280
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,951
This old guy. He won't notice
if we borrow anything.

281
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,999
- Do you come here often?
- Yeah.

282
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,915
I've got my own key.

283
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,993
That's Bozo.

284
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,634
I always come here
at night to get parts,

285
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:14,989
so I kept bringing things to make friends
with him. Bones, meat. Nothing worked.

286
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,390
I finally found out what he likes.

287
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,151
Gum? He likes gum?

288
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,597
Don't you?

289
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,193
Yeah, I guess.

290
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,829
- Doesn't he swallow it?
- No.

291
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:44,390
Bozo's pretty weird. Someday
I'll teach him how to blow bubbles.

292
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,830
I used to hang out here
when things got bad at home.

293
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,479
Pretty neat, huh?

294
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,198
Oh, yeah.

295
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,953
- I could live here.
- Not me.

296
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,038
There's some old carnival rides
over there.

297
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,475
<i>A bunch of rats live in them.</i>

298
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,156
<i>Whoa! I mean, we don't
have to go there, right, Ben? Ben?</i>

299
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,914
<i>Don't worry. He'll find us.</i>

300
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,117
Oh, there you are.

301
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,078
Here's the thing I thought we could use.

302
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,472
It's beautiful.

303
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,749
She needs a little work.
She used to be called a Tilt-a-Whirl.

304
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:22,234
It's perfect. We could all fit in here, too.

305
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:27,235
Yeah, but how are we gonna
get this thing home?

306
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,474
It's got wheels. We'll roll it.

307
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,430
Turn it around. Turn it around.

308
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,036
- Come on.
- Get off my foot, you idiot.

309
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,474
That's enough, no more.
It's fine here till morning.

310
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,232
- What time is it?
- I don't know.

311
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,837
I got a test tomorrow.
Mr Doyle hates me.

312
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,996
So, who would like to tell us something
about carbon dioxide?

313
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,831
- Ben.
- Carbon dioxide.

314
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,838
That's what you'd breathe on Mars.
They have dust storms for months there.

315
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,393
And the temperature's 50 below.

316
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,758
- And that's what you'd breathe on Mars.
- What's he talking about?

317
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,399
And...

318
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,198
Uh-huh...

319
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,998
Trisha.

320
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,628
Carbon dioxide
is formed during respiration,

321
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,472
combustion and decomposition.

322
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,390
Are you crazy? I'm here.

323
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,958
Stop it.

324
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,559
Some of you have not brought in
your field trip permissions slips.

325
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,792
They have to be in by Wednesday.

326
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:21,432
Yesterday, we briefly covered physiology.
Would anyone like to review that for us?

327
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,835
Tonight, we launch.

328
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,672
All right.

329
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,752
Very good. Not so good.

330
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:23,472
Very good. Easy test. A very high
curve. There's always an exception.

331
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,155
That's three strikes in a row, Woods.
What's the problem here?

332
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,996
- Very good. Very good.
- I'm just stupid, I guess.

333
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,876
Do you feel like something
big's about to happen?

334
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,750
Maybe, but we really
haven't been very scientific about this.

335
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:46,596
- It might be dangerous.
- Have a little faith, will you?

336
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,150
- Hey, come on. That's not funny.
- Cool it.

337
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,756
I swiped some beer,
so we can name it something.

338
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,593
It's good beer. My dad drinks a lot of it.

339
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,478
Why don't we call it the "Jules Verne"?

340
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,589
No, no. We could call it the "Einstein".
Now, that's a great name.

341
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,036
- Come on.
- You want to call it the "Lori Swenson"?

342
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,950
- Well, I have an idea.
- What's that?

343
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:24,672
How about the "Thunder Road"?
It's from a Bruce Springsteen song.

344
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,150
- It's not bad.
- Not bad? It's perfect!

345
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,313
The "Thunder Road".
I christen thee the Thunder Road".

346
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,830
The "Thunder Road"!

347
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,355
- Oh, now it breaks.
- Let's go.

348
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,276
I knew we should've put hinges
on this thing.

349
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,876
I'll take it very easy at first
because something might happen

350
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,758
and we all could be killed.

351
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,674
Stop talking about getting killed.
It's gonna be great.

352
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,910
What if the ship falls apart?

353
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,073
- She won't. She's a good ship.
- Don't be so paranoid.

354
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,392
- Ready?
- Yeah.

355
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,198
Flashlight.

356
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,995
Systems check. Air pressure.

357
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,079
- OK. We're OK there.
- Check.

358
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,959
- 12-volt system.
- Check.

359
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,509
- Exterior illumination.
- Check.

360
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,955
And drive systems response.

361
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,475
- Oh, look.
- Here's my launch-area graphic.

362
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,552
Since the "Thunder Road"'s
inside the field now,

363
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,555
I'm going to plot our movement relative to
an outside stationary point: The creek.

364
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,438
There we are.

365
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,036
- It makes sense.
- OK. Harness strength.

366
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,237
- Oh, come on. Check. Let's go.
- Wait, wait, wait.

367
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,312
- We need supplies.
- Look, supplies. Check.

368
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,630
Are you nuts?

369
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,270
- Everything.
- You nut. Are you crazy?

370
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,510
- We need to go. Come on!
- All right.

371
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,389
- Exterior illumination off.
- No. It'll be cooler if it's on.

372
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,835
The whole world's
gonna see these lights.

373
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,709
We'll turn 'em off when we get out
of the creek. It'll be cool.

374
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,553
OK. Fine. Your way. Fine.

375
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,030
- All right. Masks on.
- Mask on.

376
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,272
We'll be able to talk briefly
after the field is on.

377
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,750
Make sure you breathe through
these hoses most of the time.

378
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,912
We'll run out of oxygen
pretty fast in this thing.

379
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,718
- Ready?
- Ready.

380
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,871
Tight? Check, check, check.

381
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,793
- Stop checking. Let's go.
- Let's boogie!

382
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,632
Field on.

383
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:11,232
OK. Let's go down and to the right.

384
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,349
- Hardly feels like we're moving at all.
- Great suspension on this thing.

385
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,796
It feels like a dream, doesn't it?
It's all so perfect.

386
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,395
- I never have dreams.
- Everybody has dreams.

387
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,312
I don't.

388
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,313
Gee, I wish I'd gone to the bathroom.

389
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,191
I can't believe this.

390
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,911
We're doing over 100 mph and we
haven't used 1/10th of our power yet.

391
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,594
- Wow!
- Where shall we go?

392
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,153
- Where's all the action on Friday night?
- The drive-in.

393
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:50,796
<i>Bloodshed saved my life.
Now is the time for destruction.</i>

394
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,155
See them flying there. That's
what they call a travelling matte.

395
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,472
- How do you know?
- All these movies use it. It's standard.

396
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:14,839
<i>May the power be with us if they attack.
What they will not touch, I will conquer.</i>

397
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,310
- Oh, "Starkiller". This is great.
- You've seen this?

398
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,837
The blond guy is Starkiller and he
spends the movie blowing up aliens.

399
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,919
<i>- Karla!
- Explosions in space? That's impossible.</i>

400
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,390
What do you mean?
You can hardly see the strings.

401
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,831
<i>He was like my father.</i>

402
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,120
<i>- Do you see what I mean?
- He was my father.</i>

403
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,271
<i>Karla.</i>

404
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,196
<i>Oh, Starkiller.</i>

405
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:05,717
- Does she take her clothes off?
- Yeah, but she's got three navels.

406
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,599
Don't you think we're a little close?

407
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,515
That looks so fake.

408
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,038
We're in front of the screen.
Get us out of here.

409
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,191
What's happening?

410
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,437
- Not so fast! We're too low.
- It's making no sense.

411
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,031
- Turn us around.
- You'll kill us!

412
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,553
I'm trying.

413
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,076
- Hey, what's the deal? I gave you a 20.
- It was not.

414
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,196
We're gonna hit! Hold on!

415
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,833
What the?

416
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,156
Smooth move, Ex-lax

417
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,470
- Do you want to drive?
- Yeah.

418
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,794
I heard they were gonna tear it down
anyway. At least, I think I did.

419
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,636
It's working OK now.
Let's go back.

420
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,792
- Come on!
- Not yet. Let's see some more.

421
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,793
- Let's see what she can do.
- Are you serious?

422
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,633
- Yeah.
- She's done enough already.

423
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,796
Oh, come on.

424
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,994
OK, Charlie. What do we do now?

425
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,149
We order it down.

426
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,915
<i>Unidentified craft. You're in direct
violation of controlled airspace.</i>

427
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,153
- What did he say?
- Probably "You're under arrest. "

428
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,993
<i>You must land immediately.</i>

429
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,396
Jesus! Did you see that?

430
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,070
I don't know what I saw, Charlie.

431
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,676
Gordon, there was something inside.
Did you see it?

432
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,638
I swallowed my gum.

433
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,475
- That guy saw us for sure.
- That's just great.

434
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,949
What if he reports us
and we're arrested?

435
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,076
Then we'll have a criminal record.

436
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:57,995
Big deal. Even if he did report us,
who's gonna believe him anyway?

437
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,672
It's doing it again.

438
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,398
- What?
- I don't know.

439
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:12,150
I didn't programme anything like this.
Look, it's complete nonsense.

440
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,754
- Then where's it coming from?
- I've no idea.

441
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,071
- The computer's crazy.
- We're going straight up.

442
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,708
Is it taking over the ship?

443
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,190
It's receiving this stuff from
somewhere outside the sphere.

444
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,154
- Tell it to turn us around.
- I'm trying!

445
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,231
See. "No access. "

446
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,792
I don't know what this is
or where it's coming from.

447
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,430
- You can still read it, can't you?
- Ready for more good news?

448
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:56,151
- We're out of air.
- We are.

449
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:01,269
OK, nobody panic.
We have to trick the computer.

450
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,356
I'm going to reverse our x-axis dial.
Hold your ears.

451
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,078
I'm turning off the field
and the air's gonna rush in.

452
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,592
- Aren't we still going up?
- No. This is great.

453
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,352
We have new fresh air.

454
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:43,548
And I tricked the computer into thinking
it's going in the opposite direction.

455
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:47,110
- Then we're going straight down.
- Well, yeah...

456
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,952
We're going straight down!

457
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:11,433
Oh, we made it. We made it.
OK, 12-volt system off.

458
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,670
Wait, we're not on the ground.

459
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,798
- Last but not least...
- We're not on the ground.

460
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,635
- We are! We're home! Field off!
- Don't do it!

461
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,111
You idiot.

462
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:36,874
- You broke my Walkman.
- I brought us back down, didn't I?

463
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,712
You sure did.

464
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,998
Whoa. It took us right back home.

465
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,991
What's so funny?

466
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,436
That was great. That was incredible.

467
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,957
- Next time, we'll bring more air...
- Next time?

468
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,190
I'm not getting in that thing again

469
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,033
until we know where
those programmes come from.

470
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,872
And we need to run tests.

471
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,999
Yes. We have to run hundreds
of serious tests.

472
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,233
- It could take years.
- What are you talking about?

473
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,517
That was the most important thing
that ever happened.

474
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,275
Couldn't you feel it,
that feeling way inside?

475
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,994
- We were flying.
- Come on, Ben, make some sense.

476
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,153
- We almost didn't come back.
- But we did come back.

477
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,310
Here we are.

478
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,638
What do you think?
We should trust the dream, right?

479
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,791
Sorry, man. I want to live.

480
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,389
But we have our own spaceship.

481
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,471
You coming?

482
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,996
No.

483
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:24,029
- I want to take another look around.
- OK. Catch you later.

484
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,229
- Johann!
- Keep your projectiles to yourself.

485
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,598
There was a lot of activity in this town
last night. Numerous UFO sightings.

486
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:15,833
Many of them at the drive-in, where
the police are trying to investigating

487
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,959
to discover who destroyed
the concession stand.

488
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,475
- Wolfgang!
- What?

489
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:29,594
Your colour is not good. You should not
be making experiments so late.

490
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:34,513
- I found the bug bomb.
- Where was it?

491
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,353
Where was it? In the bathroom.

492
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:17,316
I waited a lifetime for something like this.
I want to find out what we saw.

493
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,476
OK. I saw something
down in the creek and I...

494
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,036
I don't know. I can't help it.
Can't you understand that?

495
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,839
All I know is this is driving me crazy.

496
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,279
Gordon...

497
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,993
Look, man, I've been having dreams
about this lately. Yes, really.

498
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,074
The weird thing is I haven't had dreams
like this since I was a kid.

499
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,754
<i>Lori, it's a dream.</i>

500
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,477
<i>Lori?</i>

501
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,878
<i>Wow.</i>

502
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:43,318
<i>- Is this what your first dream was like?
- Wolfgang! This is a private dream.</i>

503
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,870
<i>- Not any more.
- You too? I thought you never dream.</i>

504
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,792
<i>Yeah, so did I.</i>

505
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,397
<i>Wait. We're all here.
There must be a reason for this.</i>

506
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,676
<i>There's always a reason
when you dream.</i>

507
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,069
<i>What are these, drive-ins?</i>

508
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:09,076
<i>See, there's a diagram
with a missing part in the centre.</i>

509
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:14,633
<i>We have to remember it and figure it out
when we go up again.</i>

510
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,992
<i>- Wolfgang.
- I just had a dream weirder than yours.</i>

511
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,037
Did you get the diagram?

512
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,793
Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.

513
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,792
What's going on here?
We both had the same dream?

514
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:58,274
It's a smaller circuit board that fits onto
the original circuit board, like this.

515
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,556
- Turn it on.
- OK.

516
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,355
- What is that stuff?
- It's oxygen. It's oxygen.

517
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,556
Turn it off, stupid.

518
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:26,271
Had it turned up a little too high.
But that's OK. We can still go.

519
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,638
Finally.

520
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,516
You feel it, too.

521
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,752
Yeah, ever since the dream last night.

522
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,713
Let's face it. Somebody's calling us.

523
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,075
They've been calling
since the beginning.

524
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,559
From where?

525
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,553
I don't know,
but it's somewhere up there.

526
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:51,111
- I guess we have to find out, right?
- Well, they got us this far.

527
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,794
It's like we're supposed to go.

528
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,633
Well, let's go.

529
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,473
Before my dad sees his work shed.

530
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,240
Ben, are you using
my tweezers on your models?

531
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,992
- No.
- What are you doing?

532
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:21,157
- I'm writing a letter to Grandma.
- Oh, well, good.

533
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,912
- Mom.
- Yeah?

534
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:28,552
Remember what you told me about
dreams and doing what you want to do?

535
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,998
Well, if I really want to be an astronaut,
go out in space,

536
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,469
really do that, you'd be OK, right?

537
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,632
Sure, honey,
if that's what you really want to do.

538
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,799
- Sleep tight.
- Goodnight.

539
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,231
Bye, Mom.

540
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,512
Whoa. Hiya, kid.

541
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,589
- So, you're the spaceman?
- What?

542
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,231
- Hey, listen, is this your jacket?
- Where'd you get that?

543
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,916
You were in that UFO, weren't you?
Weren't you?

544
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,514
Hey, weren't you in there?

545
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,954
We gotta get out of here.
Some guy knows about us.

546
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,635
- Who?
- Some guy. He tried to grab me.

547
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,872
- He's probably on his way here.
- We'll kick his butt.

548
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,114
- Let's get out of here.
- I have to regulate the air pressure first.

549
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,910
- Can you do that when we're up there?
- No. You're getting on my nerves.

550
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,437
What's that?

551
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,830
Something my dad gave me.
Do you mind?

552
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,514
It's fine, fine. Just put it out of the way.

553
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,711
Nice going, kid.

554
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,839
All right. So what happens now?

555
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,117
I'll take us higher,
then they'll contact us, I guess.

556
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,596
I can't stop thinking about
what's up there. What kind of life?

557
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,355
You mean,
will it be some kind of slimy blob?

558
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:38,799
It could be anything. It could be pure
energy. It could be thought waves.

559
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,236
I don't know. It could be something
we can't even imagine.

560
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,951
How about a planet full of Amazon
women who want to breed a new race?

561
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,554
- You pervert.
- Come on, you guys.

562
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,951
It'll be great.
It'll be the greatest thing ever.

563
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:07,713
- They're here.
- See? They've taken over.

564
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:18,558
What was that? What happened?
Where are we?

565
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,073
Oh, my God.

566
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,676
Eaten alive.

567
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,755
- What if we want to go back?
- Go back?

568
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,629
Now you say this? Look around.
It's a little too late.

569
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:50,749
Will you shut up? It'll be all right.
Just don't spoil it.

570
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:55,038
We are going where no man
has gone before.

571
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,431
To unlock the secrets of the universe.

572
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,315
That's pretty incredible. Think about it.

573
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,958
The field's off.

574
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:40,229
- Well, guys, we're on our own now.
- Don't worry. It's all part of the plan.

575
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,036
Look at this place.

576
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,277
Ride's over.

577
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,750
- I guess we should get out now, huh?
- Are you crazy?

578
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,399
We can't just sit here.
They're expecting us.

579
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,233
Exactly. I'm staying right here.

580
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,756
If they give us any trouble,
we'll kick their butts.

581
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,558
What the hell's this?

582
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,757
- Let's get out of here.
- We really have to go.

583
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,677
Hello.

584
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,118
Probably radioactive now.

585
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:01,638
Our DNA's all screwed up.
And our kids'll have tentacles!

586
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:08,869
- It's dark in here.
- Maybe they don't have eyes.

587
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,429
Think we'll enjoy living here?

588
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:17,150
I wonder what they're waiting for.

589
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:21,199
I mean, they must've been preparing
for this for thousands of years.

590
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,435
Maybe they're not hungry yet.

591
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,919
Ah!

592
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,479
Where's Darren?

593
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,993
- Darren!
- Where is he?

594
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:57,869
Darren!

595
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:20,112
There must be some mistake.

596
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:23,636
Mistake, my foot.
They're testing us like mice in a maze.

597
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,836
- You're such a downer.
- I'm serious.

598
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,079
Ben. Hey, Ben, wait up.

599
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:43,272
Ben. Ben, what was that sound?

600
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,796
I don't know.

601
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,118
Oh!

602
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,719
Wolfgang!

603
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,038
Wolfgang!

604
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,318
Ben!

605
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:43,474
Darren. Are you OK?

606
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,868
That was weird.

607
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,634
- You were in a trance.
- Where's Wolfgang?

608
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:54,156
I don't know. I lost him.
This thing came out...

609
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,390
Let's find him and get out of here.

610
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,152
I don't know how it works,
but it puts pictures in your head.

611
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:04,471
I saw that dream we had
and a bunch of other weird stuff.

612
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,949
That sounds just like
in "Forbidden Planet".

613
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,510
They had this brain-booster machine.

614
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,399
Maybe that's how
they got into my dreams.

615
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,788
It smells in here.

616
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:33,629
I hate to say this, but this isn't the way
I thought it would be at all.

617
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,837
- It smells in here.
- You just said that.

618
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:41,153
- No, I didn't.
- What?

619
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:43,595
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

620
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,039
Where'd he go?

621
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:54,599
- We scared him.
- Scared HIM?!

622
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,274
Yeah. To him, we're the aliens.

623
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:01,035
- To him, we might be horrible.
- Horrible? Us?

624
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,396
Come on. He couldn't have gotten far.

625
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,078
Hello.

626
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,837
- Don't be scared.
- Ben, wait a minute.

627
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,431
We gotta find him.

628
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,914
I've waited all my life to say this.

629
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,311
Be my guest.

630
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,510
We come in peace.

631
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,395
Now try,
"How do we get back to our ship?"

632
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:11,599
Just give him a minute. He's probably
just translating in his head.

633
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,514
If we can communicate, he can give us
the answers to anything.

634
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:18,148
He's about to say something.

635
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,315
What's up, Doc?

636
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,793
What?

637
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:28,751
OK, but let's face it,

638
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:33,232
this energy field of yours is
extraordinary, but still needs lots of work.

639
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,470
Talk about bumpy rides.

640
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:40,077
You'd think a technology this advanced
could stabilise such a simple computer.

641
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:45,038
I never tire
of looking at the stars, do you?

642
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:52,832
Did you know that the light we see now
actually began aeons ago?

643
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,595
They always make me feel
so romantic.

644
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:04,230
Do you have a girlfriend on Earth?

645
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:10,111
A girlfriend?
Of course I've got a girlfriend.

646
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,111
No one special.

647
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:17,272
I'm not tied down
if that's what you mean.

648
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:28,917
It's probably not English. It's just an alien
language that sounds like English.

649
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,559
Remember this one?

650
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:37,188
# Oh, a horse is a horse
Of course, of course

651
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:40,193
# But no one can talk to a horse,
of course, that is, of course

652
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,794
# Unless the horse
is the famous Mr Ed! #

653
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,713
Everybody!

654
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:48,678
- Nobody's singing.
- Wolfgang?

655
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,350
Hi, guys. Where you been?

656
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:54,476
Looking for you.

657
01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:00,150
We were worried about you. Do you have
any consideration for your friends?

658
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,955
This is Neek.

659
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,788
And Neek, that's Darren and Ben.

660
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,633
Hello.

661
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:25,599
Hi.

662
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,469
Hi, yourself.

663
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,108
We've been looking all over for you.

664
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:38,957
Now you're just lounging around
with some alien and communicating!

665
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:46,479
Ben, she's incredibly intelligent.

666
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,679
Besides, she kind of likes me.

667
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,598
Wak.

668
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,274
What?

669
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,998
Wak.

670
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,398
- Quack? Wak?
- Wak!

671
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:06,392
Wak's your name! That's your name.

672
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:10,792
- I'm Ben. Me Ben.
- Me Tarzan.

673
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,355
What do I have to do? Eat a banana?

674
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,988
- You get it, don't you?
- No, I...

675
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:28,071
<i>Jump in!</i>

676
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:34,635
They know all about us.
It's from watching this stuff.

677
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:39,157
- Neek.
- You see? Look.

678
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,279
TV?

679
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:01,637
<i>...helps shrink swollen membranes.</i>

680
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:05,873
- They get TV up here?
- Just waves in space.

681
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:09,396
- They're crazy about it.
- There is life in outer space.

682
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,869
Here he is,
the life of outer space himself.

683
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:14,315
Let's make him feel at home.
Here's Wak!

684
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:18,837
Do you know me? Often,
when I enter a hotel or restaurant,

685
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,958
people fail to recognise me.

686
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,759
Let's start tonight's show
with your favourites.

687
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:28,959
Remember this one?
The amazing Kitchen Companion.

688
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:33,079
It slices, dices, minces, quinces.
French fries, shoestring or crinkle cut.

689
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:37,358
That's not all. Make hundreds
of julienne carrots in seconds.

690
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:40,637
One tomato lasts a month.
No more tears cutting onions.

691
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,712
How much would you expect
to pay for this miracle

692
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:47,509
that makes all previous forms
of kitchen appliances obsolete?

693
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,671
$50?

694
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,149
$100? $1000?

695
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:56,359
- What do you think?
- It's great. But...

696
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:01,876
- Well, is it just me or...
- What? What's the matter?

697
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:07,512
- They don't make any sense.
- That's the way they think we talk.

698
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:13,038
Order now and get the steak knives and
the miracle paring knives absolutely free!

699
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:16,958
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

700
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:21,153
Anyway, my wife gave me a new car.
It's called a Rolls-Kinardly.

701
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:24,437
Rolls down one hill,
"kinardly" get up the next.

702
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:29,720
A Rolls-Kinardly!

703
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,713
Whoo-whoo!

704
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,912
De train! De train!

705
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,393
Now, for the first time on our show...

706
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,117
...the Flying Sorrento Brothers.

707
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:49,989
They were supposed to be
on last week's show.

708
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:53,357
Unfortunately,
four of them are in critical condition.

709
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:57,718
So this evening, we are proud to present
the Flying Sorrento Brother.

710
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:03,432
First, I'd like to introduce four lads
from Liverpool, The Beatles.

711
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,750
But before the Beatles...

712
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:10,996
You must be proud to be
from such a wonderful place.

713
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:13,116
You mean Earth?

714
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:19,228
Thank you. No, no more, please.
My heart! My heart!

715
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:23,911
- No, no. Please.
- Earth, huh?

716
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:28,756
OK, I'd like a little audience assistance.
If someone would come up and help me.

717
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,751
You, son. Yes.

718
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:34,754
Come on stage for just a minute, please.
That's right.

719
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:37,832
Up here next to me.
What's your name, son?

720
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,195
- Ben.
- Where are you from?

721
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,510
- Earth.
- Anybody here from Earth?

722
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:46,593
See, you've got friends here.
Ben, would you do me a favour?

723
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:51,276
I'd like to improve my reception,
so would you raise my antenna?

724
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,557
- Not that one, Ben. Thank you.
- These?

725
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,917
Yes, that's right.
Move it a little to the right.

726
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:02,153
A little further. Feels good.

727
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,673
Better, Ben.

728
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:07,549
- OK. That's pretty good.
- Oh, great. Thank you very much.

729
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:10,393
Get away, son.
You bother me.

730
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,994
- Excuse me?
- Get away, boy. Off. Off.

731
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:17,711
Kids! Kids all over the world,
they only understand one thing.

732
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:23,837
# All around the world
rock 'n' roll is all they play

733
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:31,237
# All around the world
rock 'n' roll is all they play

734
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:37,473
# All them top cats
with their rock 'n' roll queens

735
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:41,679
# Just a rockin' and a rollin'
in their red and blue blue jeans

736
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:46,391
# All around the world
rock 'n' roll is here to stay

737
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:54,039
# Man, hear those jukebox jumping
All night and all through the day

738
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:00,438
# Ain't never no time for romance
They only wanna dance

739
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,511
# The people are hollering
as they hit the floor

740
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:04,671
# "Go, cat, go!"

741
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:09,072
# All around the world
rock 'n' roll is here to stay

742
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:17,236
# You can hear those jukebox jumping
All night and all through the day

743
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,118
# Wow!

744
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:36,554
# They do the bop
The take is hot

745
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:40,190
# Shim sham shimmy
and they never never stop

746
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:45,589
# All around the world
rock 'n' roll is here to stay

747
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:52,793
# You can hear those jukebox jumping
All night and all through the day #

748
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:59,993
Thank you. Thank you. You're beautiful.

749
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:03,118
You're wonderful. You're wonderful.
Thank you.

750
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:12,759
I get it. Your people have been visiting
our planet since ancient times.

751
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:17,072
Now you've come back to check up
on us and explain everything, right?

752
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:20,994
Very interesting
story. It doesn't make any sense at all.

753
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,718
Are you aware of that?

754
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:28,154
Actually, they've never been down there.
There's too many germs.

755
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:34,793
Germs! Germs that can
cause colds, bad breath, diarrhoea.

756
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:39,556
Germs that can flourish
in your family bathroom.

757
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:44,555
They had to disinfect us when we got
here just to get this close.

758
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:48,349
Besides, we know what they do
to people like us down there.

759
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:54,673
But... but this is just the movies.

760
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:59,152
This isn't the way we really are.
Don't you know that?

761
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:04,348
You expect me to believe that?
Your people just like to blow things up.

762
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:10,038
Look, we sent out those signals
because we wanted to meet.

763
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:13,988
But it had to be someone special. You.

764
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:19,678
So you could explain.
You're not like the rest of them.

765
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:24,391
You knew we could be friends,
if we only got the chance.

766
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:30,032
I know I must look weird to you,
but how do you think you look to me?

767
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,156
I watched four episodes of "Lassie"

768
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,675
before I realised
why the hairy kid never spoke.

769
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:39,711
He rolled over fine, but I didn't think
he deserved a series for that.

770
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:48,348
But this isn't real
and we don't really kill people.

771
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:51,717
Well, we do, but not aliens
because we haven't met any.

772
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:06,276
- What's that?
- Space pirates.

773
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,919
Space pirates?

774
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:20,233
- Space pirates, scourge of the universe.
- We can fight them off.

775
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,436
- Vicious. Merciless.
- We'll stand together.

776
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:28,357
They crush all who defy them.
Coming to a theatre near you. Rated R.

777
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:32,431
Good night, everybody.
# Thanks for the memories... #

778
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:33,919
There she is.

779
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,877
Go home? We can't go home.
We just got here.

780
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:44,554
We're sorry you have
to run along so soon.

781
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:47,280
Aren't they great?
Give them a big send-off.

782
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:50,034
I love this guy. I mean that sincerely.

783
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:54,671
You can see him at Tahoe on the 17th
and in Atlantic City on Easter weekend.

784
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:58,594
- Let's all try to be there.
- Tahoe?

785
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:03,712
- What's the hurry?
- Look, honey, let's not have a scene.

786
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:07,031
We came all this way
and we haven't learned anything.

787
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:10,829
- Perhaps next time.
- Next time?

788
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:16,233
Yes, next time you get to compete
for our grand prize, a Pontiac Firebird.

789
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,356
It's a brand-new car!

790
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:25,713
- We're not afraid of space pirates.
- I don't understand why we have to go.

791
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:29,395
- I really like it here.
- We get beat up all the time at home.

792
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:32,028
Y'all come back, now. Hear?

793
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:37,228
You can't just send us away.
Did we do something wrong? Is that it?

794
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:42,030
We laughed at all your jokes,
even the really dumb ones.

795
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:46,876
I don't know. What is it you want?

796
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,315
Aw, looks like my baby picture.

797
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:06,874
It's '80s music. It's cool.

798
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,874
Far out.

799
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,920
Oh, Wak.

800
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:29,149
Is that a space pirate?

801
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,673
Yes.

802
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:37,557
No, not exactly.

803
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:25,712
It's their father.

804
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:28,637
What?

805
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,189
- It's their father. They're kids.
- No way.

806
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:36,751
I mean, look at 'em.

807
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:44,593
Just a couple of kids,
and you didn't tell us?

808
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:47,877
You dreamed about meeting us.

809
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:53,114
You wanted us to be so great. We were
afraid you'd be, you know, disappointed.

810
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,718
And wouldn't want to come back again.

811
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,871
- Really?
- It's true.

812
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:05,036
It really is his vehicle
and we're not even supposed to touch it.

813
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:08,590
- What a bummer.
- You stole your dad's car?

814
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,990
- He said we'd get away with it.
- We did.

815
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:13,674
- We didn't.
- Practically, we got away with it.

816
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,831
You're such a wimp anyway.

817
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,190
Boy, he's really pissed.

818
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:33,148
That's why you have to go.
He'd never understand.

819
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:35,197
Especially about us, Wolfgang.

820
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:47,709
Well, I think it's time
for you guys to get going.

821
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,112
Do we have to?

822
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:57,273
Yeah, and we didn't even get to tell you
the secrets of the universe.

823
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,635
Ben.

824
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,913
This is for you.

825
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:07,759
What is it?

826
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:12,311
The stuff that dreams are made of.

827
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:15,990
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

828
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:17,832
I must have something...

829
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:31,756
- Pretty cute, huh?
- Hubba hubba!

830
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:35,675
Boy, I'd like to get my cups on her.

831
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:40,749
- Someday she'll be my girlfriend.
- Maybe sooner than you think.

832
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:43,992
- What's this?
- It's a harmonica.

833
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:46,196
You put it in your mouth.

834
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:51,552
Yeah, and see, you blow... No.

835
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,868
No, you can't play it very well like that.

836
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:58,031
Way to go, stupid.

837
01:28:58,200 --> 01:28:59,997
Mm...

838
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:03,596
- It's OK.
- Doesn't even offer me any.

839
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:17,589
We'll always have Paris.

840
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:23,835
Paris? Paris! Bye-bye!

841
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:55,068
Boy, and I thought my dad was tough.

842
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:00,989
<i>I've waited all my life to say this.</i>

843
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:03,037
<i>What do I have to do? Eat a banana?</i>

844
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,760
<i>And Neek, that's Darren and Ben.</i>

845
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:09,549
<i>- Hello.
- A Rolls-Kinardly!</i>

846
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:11,438
<i># All around the world #</i>

847
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:14,114
<i>- What's that?
- Space pirates.</i>

848
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:16,953
<i>It's their father. They're kids.</i>

849
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,236
<i>- Pretty cute, huh?
- Hubba hubba!</i>

850
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:21,436
<i>It's time for you guys
to get going.</i>

851
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,591
<i>Do we have to?</i>

852
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:26,877
<i>We're sorry you have
to run along so soon.</i>

853
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,871
<i>We can't go home. We just got here.</i>

854
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:32,430
<i>- Y'all come back, now. Hear?
- We were flying.</i>

855
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:36,036
<i>- You're the spaceman?
- This is for you.</i>

856
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:41,069
<i>- What is it?
- The stuff that dreams are made of.</i>

857
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:48,918
- There's the drive-in.
- What's left of it.

858
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:50,638
Oh, yeah.

859
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:56,116
There's the Safeway.

860
01:30:56,280 --> 01:31:01,115
There's my house. My dad's up.
I wonder what he's doing.

861
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,958
It's taking us back to our point of origin.

862
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:10,799
Oh, no, it's not.

863
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:17,191
- The field's off.
- Then what's holding us up?

864
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:36,316
- Oh, shoot.
- Come on.

865
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:52,836
She was a good ship.

866
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,552
Goodbye.

867
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:42,151
It's weird.
They should've called us by now.

868
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:46,871
- What if we never hear from them?
- I know. We've got to get back there.

869
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:50,999
But we don't have our ship. No power.

870
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:55,631
It's just so frustrating. No one on Earth
is ever going to top Neek.

871
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:58,439
Gee, I thought they really liked us.

872
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:03,956
I wonder what they're doing right now.

873
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:08,875
Come on, let's go. They've probably
been grounded for three million years.

874
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:39,596
<i>Who was the scientist
who discovered nickel as an element?</i>

875
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:41,352
<i>Ben.</i>

876
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:43,795
Nickel...

877
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,916
Thomas Jefferson?

878
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:53,713
- Trisha.
- Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, 1751.

879
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:56,474
Very good, Trisha.

880
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:18,079
<i>All right.</i>

881
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:21,391
<i>They're sending again.
I knew they would.</i>

882
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:25,792
<i>Wow. This one looks really complicated.</i>

883
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:05,553
<i>If this is all a dream, then what
happens when we wake up?</i>

884
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:09,508
<i>I don't know, but I can't wait to find out.</i>

885
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:14,359
<i>Whoo-whoo!</i>

886
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:18,793
A guy goes to a psychiatrist,
has an examination.

887
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:23,954
Afterwards, the shrink says,
"Well, I think you're crazy. "

888
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:26,350
The guy says, "I want a second opinion. "

889
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:29,751
And the shrink says,
"All right, I think you're ugly too. "
