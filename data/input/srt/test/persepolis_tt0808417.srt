00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,500
Passport, please.

3
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,400
Madam,
your ticket and your passport.

4
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,300
Marji, stop running!

5
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,600
Look! It's Nioucha over there!

6
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,300
Marji, you've really grown up!

7
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,800
Did you bring me a present?

8
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,900
How is Paris?

9
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,700
And the Eiffel Tower?

10
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,800
Welcome to Teheran.

11
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,000
You're here!

12
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,000
Your luggage.

13
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,400
No, it's me!

14
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,300
Come on! They're waiting for us.

15
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,300
I remember.

16
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,900
Back then,
I had a quiet life.

17
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,700
A little girl's life.

18
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,200
I used to love fries with ketchup
and Bruce Lee,

19
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,400
I was wearing Adidas shoes
and I had 2 obsessions:

20
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,700
to shave my legs and
to become the last prophetess.

21
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,500
If you put a pen under your tits

22
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,300
and it gets stuck then you're
in deep shit.

23
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,100
If we shake this one,

24
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,100
we can fill a box.

25
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,800
Calm down!

26
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,500
They let me see him last week.

27
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,700
He wasn't a pretty sight.

28
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,100
They told me that they would
release him. It's been 4 years.

29
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,600
Don't worry.

30
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,700
This regime won't last much longer.
There's going to be one heck of a row.

31
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,700
Mom! Marji hurt me!

32
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,200
The dragon's revenge is a
dish best eaten cold!

33
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,600
The dragon is gonna get some.

34
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
"I, Marjane, future prophetess,
have decided that:

35
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,200
"One, everybody must have
a good behavior.

36
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,500
"Two, everybody must
preach good words.

37
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,500
"Three, everybody must
do one good deed.

38
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,900
"Four, the poor must be able to
eat one fried chicken everyday.

39
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,200
"Five, no old woman will
suffer ever again. "

40
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
Marji,
if it's gonna be like that,

41
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,600
I'll be your first disciple.

42
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,400
Really? Great!

43
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,400
How to be sure that
they won't suffer anymore?

44
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,100
It'll be forbidden.

45
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,900
I should have thought about it.

46
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,400
What's going on?

47
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Death to the shah!
Death to the shah!

48
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,500
I knew it!

49
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,800
I knew it!

50
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,400
This is an historic moment!

51
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,000
He's finally gonna pay.

52
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,100
Yes, daughter.
Your father will be avenged.

53
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,600
The shah will meet his
buddies in Washington.

54
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,600
As for myself,
I think I love the shah.

55
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,200
He's been chosen by God.

56
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,000
Yes! Absolutely!

57
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,000
God himself told me.
The teacher too.

58
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
The shah wasn't chosen by God.

59
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,000
Lies!

60
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,700
Shh...

61
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,200
That's what they say.

62
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,100
I'll tell you how it happened.

63
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,200
Truth is that 50 years ago,
the shah's father, an officer,

64
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,000
wanted to overthrow the
Qadjar emperor.

65
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,200
I'll do like Ataturk!
I'll modernize the country.

66
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,000
I'll create a republic!

67
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,000
But the English heard about it.

68
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,700
Hello! Why do you want
to create a republic?

69
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,100
You could be emperor!

70
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,800
Me? Emperor?

71
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,400
Of course!
It's better than president.

72
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,600
You'll have full powers.

73
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,500
A country like yours

74
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,000
needs a strong man like you
to rule it.

75
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,700
Hmm... It's quite true.

76
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,700
And also... you know that
the clergy

77
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,800
is against the republic.

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,400
Between us, he's right.

79
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,300
What must I do?

80
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,000
Nothing. You give us the oil.

81
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,100
We'll take care of the rest.

82
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,800
Now, I am the king!
Everything that belong to you is mine.

83
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,600
He was an asshole!

84
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,900
- Oh!
- Yes and no.

85
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,100
He was a dictator,
but he modernized Iran.

86
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,500
He loved his country,
unlike his son, his successor.

87
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,800
I am the king now!
I am the light of the Aryans!

88
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,800
I'll make this country
the most modern of all time!

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,500
Our people will shine again!

90
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,400
Yes, the shah's father
has been very hard.

91
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,300
He put your grandpa in prison.

92
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
But his son was ten times worse.

93
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,200
Grandpa has been in prison?

94
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
Yes! He was a member of
the royal family.

95
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,700
He was a Qadjar prince. The shah's
father took everything from him.

96
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,900
He went to prison because
he was a communist.

97
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,700
My grandpa was a Qadjar prince
and also a communist!

98
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,500
God damn it! You're still alive.
I was worried.

99
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,300
- They shot on people!
- It was hot.

100
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,800
We escaped but we got caught later.

101
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,400
Those sons of bitches
took my films.

102
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,200
- We were at the police station.
- Marji was overexcited.

103
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,900
She was a pain in the neck with the
proletarians, the class struggle

104
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,100
and this bearded man,
"Che Guevero. "

105
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,100
The guy who was killed
wasn't even 20 years old.

106
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,500
What is this country?

107
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,500
- It's one hell of a mess, daughter.
- Death to the shah!

108
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,700
Here it goes again!

109
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,900
Death to the shah!
Death to the shah!

110
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,800
Marji!

111
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,600
Go to bed now!

112
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,900
Death to the shah!
Death to the shah!

113
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,500
I understand your revolt.

114
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,600
We'll try to walk together
towards democracy.

115
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,400
We'll build the future together.

116
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,600
Siamak!

117
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,600
- They released you?
- Hello, Ebi.

118
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,000
It's Siamak!
He's back.

119
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Hello, Tadji.

120
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,700
We're so happy to see you alive!

121
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,300
Come in!

122
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,600
Don't stay in front of the door.

123
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,800
But it's Marjane!
You've grown!

124
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,800
You were still a baby
when I was arrested.

125
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And now you're a young lady.

126
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,900
Who is this guy?

127
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,900
My father. He was in prison.

128
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,800
He's a hero.

129
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,000
Those scientists knew the
human body very well.

130
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,800
They knew how to hit
where it hurts.

131
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,300
I've been lashed with
large electric wire cables.

132
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,500
My foot doesn't look
like a foot anymore.

133
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,300
There are nerves going straight
to the brain under the feet.

134
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,800
It's an indescribable pain.

135
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Our torturers had been
trained by the CIA.

136
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,600
They were at the
forefront of torture.

137
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,400
What about Hamid?
What happened to him?

138
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,200
Hamid has been murdered.

139
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,100
As a member of the guerilla,
it was hell for him.

140
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,100
He has some cyanide with him.

141
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,000
But unfortunately,
he couldn't use it.

142
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,500
So he endured the worst tortures.

143
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,400
The one who loses will be
tortured to the death.

144
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,900
- Cool!
- What kind of torture?

145
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,300
He will be lashed with
the electric wire cable!

146
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,300
But first, he'll have to put
that in his mouth.

147
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,800
And chew three times.

148
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,700
Yeah!

149
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,600
Look, it's Ramine!

150
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,400
Farzad told me that his father was a
member of the shah's secret service.

151
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,800
His father killed a million of
people with his own hands!

152
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,100
A million!?

153
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,600
Absolutely.

154
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,700
We'll give Ramine a lesson
in their name.

155
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,000
Yeah! We'll gouge his eyes out!

156
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,700
Marjane!

157
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,200
What are you doing?

158
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,800
- Marji found some nails.
- We're gonna smash Ramine's face.

159
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,400
Would you like it if
I nailed you by the ears?

160
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,800
Go back home into your room
and stay there.

161
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,200
Marjane, what's happening to you?

162
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,200
It's not a behavior worthy
of a prophetess.

163
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,600
But God,
Ramine's father killed people!

164
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,600
Marjane, this poor Ramine
must not bear the burden

165
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,400
of his father's mistakes.

166
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,700
Bad guys will pay sooner or later.
Have faith in my justice.

167
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,300
Your duty is to forgive,
not to make justice.

168
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,700
Ramine?

169
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,900
What do you want?

170
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,800
Listen, your father is a murderer,
but it's not your fault.

171
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,200
I forgive you.

172
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,200
He killed communists,
and communists are the devil!

173
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,500
The country was euphoric

174
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,400
during the months following
the shah's departure.

175
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,400
Everybody had been a revolutionary
and had fought the shah.

176
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
The wine stain of our neighbour

177
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,700
had changed into a war wound.

178
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,500
Our teacher, admirer of the shah,

179
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,500
ordered us to tear off all the
pictures of the royal family.

180
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,300
Political meetings were increasing
and yesterday's enemies

181
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,200
had become heroes of the nation.

182
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,300
It's in this climate that, one night,
uncle Anouche appeared in my life.

183
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,000
Now, everything will be better.
Nothing will stop the people.

184
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,100
We'll finally have a free
and fair society.

185
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,400
Proletariat will rule
as Lenin predicted.

186
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,400
Uncle Anouche?

187
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,400
How long did you stay in prison?

188
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,500
Nine years.

189
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,300
Longer tha Laly's father?

190
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,200
How old are you?
Are you a communist?

191
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,600
Marji, let your uncle digest!

192
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,400
She wants to know everything.

193
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,800
It's a good thing to be curious.

194
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,300
Have you digested?

195
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,400
Go to bed!

196
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,800
But!

197
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,000
Put your pajamas on and I'll come.

198
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,400
Did you see?
They're preparing the elections.

199
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,200
People will want
to keep their freedom

200
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,200
after this dictatorship.

201
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,000
It will never be worse
than under the shah.

202
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,300
I'm ready!

203
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,200
You'll see,
she'll eat your brain.

204
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
I'm ready!

205
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,700
I'll start with the beginning.

206
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,900
I was 18 years old when
my uncle and my friends

207
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,300
declared the independence of
Azerbaidjan's Iranian province.

208
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,600
Wow!

209
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,200
Fereydoun appointed himself as
minister of Justice of this republic.

210
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,800
Justice is the basis of democracy.

211
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Men must be equal
in front of the law.

212
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,800
I became his secretary.

213
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,900
It's just a beginning.
We'll free Iran from dictatorship.

214
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,400
Province by province,
city by city.

215
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm sure of it!

216
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,200
It wasn't easy for me because
my father was loyal to the shah.

217
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,800
My son is a traitor!
Go and meet your stupid brother!

218
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,400
You'll all be shot!
Shot!

219
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,600
My father couldn't have been
more right. One morning...

220
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,400
My God! Fereydoun!

221
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,800
I had to escape.
I had no choice.

222
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,000
While my uncle was facing
his destiny alone...

223
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,100
I walked for days in the storm.

224
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,300
I was hungry, I was cold,
but I kept going.

225
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,700
I crossed Alborz mountains
to take refuge at my parents home,

226
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,400
in Astara.

227
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,600
Who dares bother me at this hour?

228
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,900
My God, Anouche!
My God!

229
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,800
It's our son, he's almost dead.

230
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,200
My dear son!

231
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,300
My son...

232
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,300
My dear son, forgive me!

233
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,400
I couldn't stay, I was wanted.

234
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,300
I had to go into exile.

235
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,300
I swam across the Aras river
and I arrived in USSR.

236
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,200
What did you do then?

237
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,000
I went to Leningrad.

238
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,800
Then to Moscow, I got my doctorate
in Marxism-Leninism.

239
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,100
But I was missing my family.

240
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,900
I tried to came back by train with
forged identity papers but it didn't work.

241
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,900
- They arrested me.
- Then you went to prison?

242
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,100
Yes. You know...

243
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,500
It's important that you know.

244
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,700
The memory of the family
must not be forgotten.

245
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,200
Even if it's hard,
even if you don't understand everything.

246
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,100
Don't worry, uncle Anouche.
I'll never forget.

247
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,900
Were you married in Russia?

248
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,800
It's late. You must sleep.

249
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,800
Here, it's for you.

250
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,500
I made it in prison.

251
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,800
It's made of breadcrumbs.

252
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,900
99,99% of the people
voted democratically

253
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,000
for the islamic republic.

254
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,000
It's normal. Each revolution
has its transition period.

255
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,200
Half the country is illiterate.

256
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,000
Only nationalism or religious
ethics rally people.

257
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,400
Mina left the country.
She thinks it's too dangerous.

258
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,400
We found Mohsen drowned
in the bath tube.

259
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,800
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

260
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,400
Siamak and his family left.
Those bastards killed his sister.

261
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,900
Maybe we should leave too.

262
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,400
You could be a cleaning lady
and me, a taxi driver.

263
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,000
We'll get rid of the
antirevolutionaries.

264
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,500
Between them and us, there's only
one law, the law of blood.

265
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,700
- Marji?
- Yes?

266
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,700
They arrested Anouche.

267
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,100
I know.

268
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,400
- Daddy!
- It will be all right, honey.

269
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,100
Do you want to do
something for him?

270
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,000
Anouche can have one visitor.
You're the one she wants to see.

271
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
I'll go.

272
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,900
Ten minutes.

273
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,800
What a nice dress!

274
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,500
What a nice little girl!

275
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,500
Your visit honours me.

276
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,700
You're the little girl
I wish I would have had.

277
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,800
But you'll see, one day,
proletariat will rule

278
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,000
Here.

279
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,100
I made another cygnus with
breadcrumbs for you.

280
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,400
It's the uncle of the first one.

281
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,400
Star of my life.

282
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,000
What's up my child?
Don't be sad.

283
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,800
Shut the fuck up!
They killed him and you did nothing!

284
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,800
I've nothing to do with it...

285
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,100
Shut up!
I don't want to see you again!

286
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,300
Go away! Go away!

287
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,600
Get lost!

288
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,100
One year after the revolution,
Iraq attacked Iran.

289
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,600
Saddam took advantage of the
country's weakness to strike.

290
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,200
The revolution and the army
massive cleansings had weakened us.

291
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,000
In the name of the fight
against the foreign enemy,

292
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,400
the state wiped out
the enemy inland,

293
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,200
the old opponents to
the shah's government.

294
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,200
Arrests and executions increased.

295
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,400
Everybody was scared.

296
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,800
The new government established
even more repressive laws.

297
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,200
Within two years,
our everyday life changed.

298
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,800
And so did we.

299
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
Come on!

300
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,500
On the heart for our martyrs!

301
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,400
Sons and daughters of Iran,

302
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,300
war killed our best children.

303
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,700
Truth will soon arise
from their blood.

304
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,400
Who did they die for?

305
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,800
It's for us.

306
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,600
It's for us!

307
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,400
Hey! Martyrs!

308
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,700
Martyrs! Martyrs!

309
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,200
Finish me off!

310
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,200
Satrapi, what are you doing?

311
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,600
I'm suffering, isn't it obvious?

312
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,600
Go to the class immediately!

313
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,800
The veil is synonymous with freedom.
A worthy woman must cover herself

314
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
from the eyes of men.
The one revealing herself is a sinner.

315
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,400
- She'll burn in hell.
- Hey! Did you see that?

316
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,700
- Wow!
- Our soldiers are dying

317
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,500
for our country...
- Hey!

318
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,700
Look!

319
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,700
- Pfff! Abba,
it's for the simple minded!

320
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,600
Go outside in close order!
Come on!

321
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
Mom, what do we eat?

322
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,500
What about some chili?

323
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,500
Yes, so we can fart!

324
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,500
Give me that!

325
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,200
- I saw it first!
- Yeah right, bitch!

326
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,200
Stop!

327
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,000
That's how it is as soon
as a shop is empty!

328
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,300
Each must take according
to their needs.

329
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,400
What business is it of yours?

330
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,600
Shut up!

331
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,800
Put your scarf back on.

332
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,300
Hey! I'm talking to you!

333
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,400
Don't get too familiar.

334
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,400
Show some respect.

335
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,500
Respect?

336
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,200
Women like you,

337
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,500
I fuck them against the walls!

338
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,400
Get in!

339
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
Mom, are you all right?

340
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,100
Yes, darling.
I'm fine.

341
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,700
Are you moving or what?

342
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,200
Shut the hell up!

343
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,200
Mom, give me 50 tomans!

344
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,200
What for?

345
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,500
To buy a tape.

346
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,800
What about your Bee Gees tapes?

347
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,700
The Bee Gees suck!

348
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,100
Stevie Wonder.
Julio Iglesias.

349
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,700
Pink Floyd.

350
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,100
"Jichael Mackson. "

351
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,000
Lipstick, nail polish, cards.

352
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,600
Iron Maiden.

353
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,100
- How much?
- 100.

354
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,400
- 50.
- 60.

355
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,800
- 50.
- 60.

356
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,000
- 50.
- 50.

357
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,700
What the hell is this outfit?

358
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,200
Punk shoes!

359
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,500
Which ones?

360
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,300
Those.

361
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,700
They're sneakers.

362
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,100
It's punk.

363
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,600
I play basketball at school.

364
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,200
And this jacket?

365
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
And that?

366
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,700
Michael Jackson!

367
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,600
A symbol of decadence!

368
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,600
Not at all, madam.
It's... It's...

369
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,800
- Malcolm X.
- Are you kidding me?

370
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,800
Lower your scarf, you little whore!

371
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,200
- Follow us to the committee.
- Sorry, madam.

372
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,000
My mother is dead. My evil
mother-in-law is taking care of me.

373
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,800
She'll kill if I don't go back home.
She'll burn me with the iron.

374
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,900
She'll force my father to
put me in an orphanage.

375
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,200
Have mercy!
Please, madam. Mercy...

376
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,300
Mercy. Have mercy, madam...

377
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,300
Phew!

378
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,100
Our soldiers bravery bore fruit.

379
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:34,200
Tonight, our army destroyed 63 tanks
and 26 Iraqi fighters.

380
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,500
The blood of our martyrs is
irrigating our sacred land.

381
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,400
Deserts of despair
will blossom from it.

382
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,400
Dying as a martyr is like injecting
blood in the veins of society.

383
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,400
Are you all right, Mrs Nassrine?

384
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,300
No, I'm not.
They gave that to my son at school.

385
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,100
They told them that if they
died in combat

386
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,100
they would go to
heaven with this key!

387
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,200
They've been told that in heaven,

388
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,900
there's plenty of food and women...

389
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,900
Women?!

390
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,100
Well, yes...
He's 14 yers old, he's interested.

391
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,800
I suffered a lot.

392
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,400
I raised my 5 children
with my tears.

393
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,900
Now they want to take my elder
son for this key.

394
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,600
I've always been
faithful to religion.

395
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,500
I prayed, wore a veil and obeyed.

396
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,400
If that's how things are then
I don't want to believe in anything.

397
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,600
It's me!

398
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,100
They arrested the Rochanis.

399
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,400
They found some alcohol
at their home.

400
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,000
Who are you covering yourself for?

401
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,100
For mister.

402
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,000
That's how we've been raised.

403
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,400
Don't worry.

404
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,200
I'll talk to your son.

405
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,600
Thanks to my parents,

406
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,700
Mrs Nassrine's son didn't
go up to the front.

407
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,700
Between the fear of the bombings,
the government repression,

408
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:10,000
and the spying of the neighbours,
life was taking its course.

409
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,000
To make things bearable,

410
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,100
people were partying in secret.

411
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,600
People were getting drunk at
the parties. Alcohol was forbidden,

412
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,200
so my uncle was providing
the family with wine.

413
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,200
He has installed a wine production
laboratory in his cellar.

414
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,600
Mrs Nassrine,
my uncle's cleaning lady

415
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,200
was pressing the grapes.

416
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,100
May God forgive me!

417
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,700
Going to these
parties was dangerous

418
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,100
but it was our only
little moment of freedom.

419
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,900
Come on! Get out!

420
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,200
Identity papers,
driver licence.

421
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,100
Ok, ok.

422
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,600
Come closer.

423
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,800
Blow.
You drank.

424
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,800
No.

425
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,900
You're lying, you dirty westerner!

426
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,000
That's enough!

427
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,000
How dare you talk to me like that?

428
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,100
Shut up!

429
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,400
Listen.

430
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,600
I could be your mother.

431
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,100
How old are you?
My daughter is 13.

432
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,900
You'd be in hell without your wife.

433
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,400
Thank you!

434
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,200
Get in! We're going to your place

435
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,300
to check if there are some bottles.

436
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,700
Grandma, Marji, you go first.

437
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,900
Empty all the bottles.

438
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,400
- But how?
- Don't worry, my daughter.

439
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,400
I was used to it with your father.

440
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,900
We had to hide the flyers.

441
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,000
Listen, the neighbour on the same
floor is a bit old.

442
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,600
He has a heart condition.
He could die

443
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,800
if we make too much noise.
Can we come to an agreement?

444
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,000
Hey! Where are you going?

445
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,700
I'm diabetic, son.
I have to drink some syrup.

446
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,200
Diabetic?
Like my mother.

447
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,300
Go ahead.

448
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,000
Where are the others?

449
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,300
Their arrogance isn't ideological.
A few bills were enough.

450
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,700
Tell me,
did you throw everything away?

451
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,500
Well, yes!

452
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,100
Shit!

453
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,000
It's his heart again.

454
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,800
They wanted to stop the communists.

455
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,500
They threw a grenade.
Taher couldn't endure it.

456
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,400
He was lying on the ground
when I arrived.

457
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,000
Everything will be all right.

458
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,800
No, it won't.

459
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,800
He must have an
open-heart operation.

460
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,600
They can't afford it here.

461
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,300
He must be sent to England.

462
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,800
I went to see the administrative
director of the hospital.

463
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,800
It's unbelievable.
Do you know who he was?

464
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,400
My old window cleaner.

465
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,600
I pretended not to recognize
this moron.

466
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,800
Only people who are seriously ill
can leave the country.

467
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,200
My husband had three heart attacks.

468
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,000
He must be operated or he'll die.

469
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,900
We'll do our best.

470
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,900
If God wants it, he'll get better.
Everything depends on God.

471
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,000
I need your authorization
for his passport.

472
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,000
If God wants it.

473
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,600
This asshole grew a beard
and wears a suit.

474
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,200
And now he's a director!

475
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,200
My husband's fate depends on

476
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,800
a window cleaner!

477
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,800
He doesn't watch women in
the eyes anymore.

478
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Fucking asshole!

479
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,500
I know someone who
is making passports.

480
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,400
Calm down.
It'll be all right.

481
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,400
Wait!
I'm coming with you.

482
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,500
Where did I put it?

483
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,000
Ha! Here it is!

484
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,000
Look at that.

485
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,400
It looks like a real one.

486
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,200
A month work,
just for this stamp!

487
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,900
What's your name?

488
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,000
How much time do you need?

489
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,200
Passports are very much in demand.

490
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,100
I make a living with that.
They closed my publishing business.

491
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,600
It takes 15 days,
but I'll do it in a week.

492
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,400
Great. Be quick.

493
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,800
It's Niloufar.

494
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,100
This is Ebi,

495
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,100
Anouche's brother,
I talked to you about him.

496
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,200
Hello.

497
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,900
She is a communist too.

498
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,600
Her brother was my messenger.
I'm hiding her in my cellar.

499
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,400
It's the only place
where she's safe.

500
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,200
Is he stupid or what?

501
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,300
He's gonna get crushed!

502
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,100
Here! That's what I said!

503
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,000
Don't look.

504
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,500
- It's too ugly.
- Stop!

505
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:30,400
What of piece of shit! Apart
from cutting their stomach open

506
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,000
and making disgusting monsters,
those Japanese can't do anything.

507
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,900
Grandma, do you think that
uncle Taher is gonna die?

508
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,000
- Of course.
- Really? You think so?

509
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,900
If he doesn't find any passport
to leave, he won't make it.

510
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,600
He shouldn't have smoked so much.

511
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,400
What a load of crap!
His heart is sick

512
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,400
because his children are far away.

513
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,300
A hot beans pastry boat please.

514
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,400
Children always leave
sooner or later.

515
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,700
But being separated from your 13 years
old children because of war is absurd!

516
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,800
It can break you heart for sure.

517
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,900
I'd be dead already if I was him.

518
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,900
May God exterminate those barbarians.

519
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,800
May God hear you.

520
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,300
Hello? Ha, Khosrow, is that you?

521
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,000
So, what's up?

522
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,200
They arrested Niloufar.
I have to escape!

523
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,600
Hello?

524
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,700
Khosrow?

525
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,100
Hello?

526
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,400
Niloufar was executed.

527
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,900
Khosrow escape by the mountains
in Turkey and went to Sweden.

528
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:10,300
Uncle Taher was buried
three weeks after these events.

529
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,500
The war intensified.

530
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,200
Let me pass!

531
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,600
Sorry!

532
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,100
Let me pass!

533
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,300
Stop!

534
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,100
I live over there!

535
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
Go.

536
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,300
- Marji!
- Mom!

537
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,900
Are you all right?

538
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,800
Yes, honey.
I'm fine.

539
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,800
Where did the missile go?

540
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,000
It hit the Baba Levys.

541
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,400
What? The Baba Levys?

542
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:27,500
Thanks to the government, we don't
have any political prisoner left.

543
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,800
Madam?

544
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,400
We finally earned our freedom.

545
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,400
- Madam?
- What?

546
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,800
It's the new government that ordered
the execution of my uncle.

547
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,900
From 3000 prisoners during the shah,
we now have 300000 with you.

548
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,300
How dare you lie?

549
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,600
Stop it!

550
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,400
Who was it?

551
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,000
The school. Marji put the religion
teacher to her place.

552
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,600
- Again?
- Yes.

553
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,200
She takes after her uncle.

554
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,800
Do you want her to end like
her uncle, executed?

555
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,800
Do you know what they do to
young women like Niloufar?

556
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,100
The law forbids to kill a virgin.

557
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,300
She's forced to marry a
Guardian of the Revolution.

558
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,200
Then he takes her virginity
and executes her.

559
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,000
Do you understand?

560
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,700
If someone touches one of her
hair, I'll kill him!

561
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:28,900
A little later, they decided
to send me abroad.

562
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,300
Since I had studied at
the French school in Teheran,

563
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:37,100
I'd go to the French school in Vienna.
My father managed to get me a visa.

564
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,800
My mother's best friend
was supposed to take me in.

565
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,600
The day before my departure,
grandma came to sleep at home.

566
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:50,300
Every morning she put jasmine
flowers in her bra.

567
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,000
When she was taking it off, the
flowers were falling from her tits.

568
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,400
It was magic.

569
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,900
How do you manage to have
such round tits at your age?

570
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,700
Everyday I put them for 10 minutes
in an icy water bowl.

571
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,300
I'll miss you.

572
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,400
I'll come and see you.

573
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,400
Listen.

574
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:19,100
I'm gonna give you an advice
that will always be useful.

575
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,600
In your life, you'll meet
a lot of assholes.

576
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,900
Remember that it's stupidity
that pushes them to be evil.

577
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,800
It will prevent you from
answering to their nastiness.

578
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,800
Because there's nothing worse
than bitterness and vengeance.

579
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,900
Always remain worthy and
true to yourself.

580
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,800
You'll see,
everything will be all right.

581
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,700
No tears.
Think about your future.

582
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,400
Europe is opening to you.

583
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,600
When you'll arrive in Vienna,
eat a sachertorte.

584
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,400
It's a delicious chocolate cake.
We'll come to see you.

585
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,600
You're a grown up.
No tears!

586
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,800
- Daddy...
- Enough.

587
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,200
You must leave.

588
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,000
Never forget who you are
and where you're coming from.

589
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,600
My daughter.

590
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,800
- Mom!
- My little Marji.

591
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:15,500
Europe opened itself to me,
but not like I imagined.

592
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,300
After a few days at
my mother's friend home,

593
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:22,600
she decided that their apartment
was too small to accomodate me.

594
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,400
She found me a bed and board
where I would be very well

595
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,600
according to her.

596
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:45,800
What?

597
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,600
Was?

598
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,400
Huh?

599
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,100
I was finding

600
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:28,000
shelves of products that
no longer existed in my country.

601
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,800
For a while,

602
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,100
going to the supermarket
was my favorite pastime...

603
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,900
favorite pastime...

604
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,200
favorite pastime...

605
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,400
Anyway! It was urgent that
I make some new friends.

606
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,800
At the French school,
I could understand the others

607
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,700
and be understood.

608
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,100
Do you have a smoke?

609
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,800
Quickly, the school dropouts
were interested in me.

610
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,200
There was Momo, Thierry,
Olivier and Eve.

611
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,100
My nationality and my history
were fascinating them.

612
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,600
You saw a revolution and a war?

613
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,200
- Yeah.
- Did you see many dead people?

614
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,800
Err... A few.

615
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,300
Wow!

616
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,800
Terrific.

617
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I was soon a member of the band.

618
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,500
With Momo,
I discovered nonchalance,

619
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,800
a forced nihilism concept and
the alternative Vienna life.

620
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,600
I admit that at the beginning
it was a little difficult.

621
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,400
And after all, why not?

622
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:55,500
I was trying to convince myself
that I had found my place.

623
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,500
But I remained different.

624
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,600
Holidays were sure
to remind me of it.

625
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:06,200
Shit, Christmas again!
I'll have to see my whole family.

626
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,400
All this because of
an American invention.

627
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,800
Santa Claus is in red and white...

628
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,400
It was a Coca-Cola mascot.

629
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,200
I'll be bored to death in Monte-Carlo.

630
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,200
Monte-Carlo is still all right.

631
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,500
Me, I'm gonna see my father in Brazil,
what a load of crap!

632
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,300
It's at least a 13 hours flight!

633
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,300
Holidays are scraps left to the pleb.

634
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,200
If the anarchists had won,
we wouldn't work anymore.

635
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,400
Is everything all right, my dear?

636
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,600
It's fine.
What are you doing for Christmas?

637
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,600
So?

638
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,000
She'll be with some friends
from shool. Be careful.

639
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,900
Is there anything you need?

640
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,300
You're right, enjoy it.
Kisses.

641
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,700
Eat some frutis and vegetables.

642
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,200
Is it a common behavior?

643
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,400
What?

644
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,300
- The way you're eating?
- We can eat in front of TV.

645
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,300
Maybe, but not in a saucepan.

646
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,400
So it's true,
Iranians have no education.

647
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,200
Is it true that you were
all prostitutes?

648
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,300
Oh!

649
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,000
It was the beginning of
a series of moves.

650
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,200
I was flying from
apartment to apartment.

651
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,800
Eve and her mother took me in.

652
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,400
After that I was living
with 8 homosexuals.

653
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,100
Next, I was living in a maid room
then at some friends home,

654
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,200
and at some friends of
some friends home,

655
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,900
to finally end in
Frau Doktor Schloss villa.

656
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,900
She was a retired
philosophy teacher.

657
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,200
To sum up, she was nuts.

658
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,100
The rent is 2000 schillings a month.

659
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,400
- You like dogs, don't you?
- Yes, yes. I love them.

660
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,500
Yuki adopted you.

661
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,000
Dogs have a sixth sense.

662
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,500
They recognize good people.

663
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,500
I decided to become integrated
during the next year.

664
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,600
But sometimes, western culture
remained a mistery.

665
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,000
Ja voll! Ja voll!

666
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,900
I had to improve my knowledge.

667
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,800
From Sartre to Bakounin,
from Zweig to Freud,..

668
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,900
I read everything I could.

669
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:51,200
But I understood that some things
would be beyond me forever.

670
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,900
Did you see?
This fat pig Waldheim has been elected.

671
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,400
I want to puke!

672
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:07,100
It can't last any longer.
We must demonstrate!

673
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,200
All of this is hot air.

674
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,400
Life is empty.

675
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,600
When man realizes it,

676
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,500
he creates games for ruler and...

677
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,500
Bullshit!
Life isn't absurd!

678
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,400
People give their life for freedom!

679
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,600
My uncle didn't die for fun.

680
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Fucking asshole!

681
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,800
My feeling of disarray was immense.

682
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:38,000
I was safe here while my kins
were enduring the war.

683
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:42,600
I couldn't let go this
feeling of guilt.

684
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,200
I wanted to live like
a girl of my age.

685
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,200
The time of change was coming.

686
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,200
Within a few months,
I became a young woman.

687
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,400
It was a time of endlessly
repeating ugliness.

688
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:01,300
First, I grew 18 cm.
Then my face changed.

689
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:05,600
My face got longer, my right eye
got bigger, followed by my chin.

690
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,200
My right hand became huge,
then it was my left foot.

691
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:13,200
My nose got three time bigger.
My breast grew.

692
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,600
My buttocks appeared,
restoring my centre of gravity.

693
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,200
And to finish, a huge mole
appeared on my nose.

694
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,400
You see, Yuki? I told you.
She's a whore!

695
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,900
What a shitty music!

696
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,800
There are only assholes here.

697
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,200
Bakounin wanted the socialist
resolutions to be voted.

698
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,000
We wouldn't be where we are.

699
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,100
Really?

700
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,100
Capitalism is eating away
our society, don't you see?

701
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:58,600
Yeah, of course. Well...
Where are you from... Marie-Jeanne?

702
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,000
Yeah... I'm from...
I'm French.

703
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,200
Ha? I wouldn't have guessed.
Last year I was in Paris.

704
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,400
Excuse me, I must go.

705
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,500
Okay. Well then, bye.

706
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,100
So you're French?

707
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,100
Grandma, stop it.

708
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,200
It was just a question.

709
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,800
I didn't know you were French.

710
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,600
Do you think it's easy to be Iranian?

711
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,400
People are looking at me
as if I was a savage.

712
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:46,500
We're just fanatics screaming
and fighting each other.

713
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,300
Is it a reason to disown your origin?

714
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,400
Remember what I told you.

715
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,600
Be true to yourself.

716
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:08,400
Do you know what she told my brother?

717
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,900
That she was French.

718
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,800
- I'm not kidding.
- Did he believe her?

719
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,300
What? Did you see her face?

720
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,500
- He wanted to chat her up?
- Don't be ridiculous!

721
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,500
I'd kill myself if
he went out with this ugly ducking.

722
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,100
Shut the fuck up!

723
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:28,200
I'm Iranian and proud to be!

724
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:34,100
After 3 years in Austria
I was finally feeling good.

725
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:37,800
Momo, Thierry, Eve and Olivier
had left school.

726
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,100
I had new friends.

727
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:45,700
There was Birgit, a 30 years old
hippy with the face of an old child.

728
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:50,700
She had a house in the forest
where she was having parties.

729
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,700
The State could rest easy.
Those so-called anarchist meetings

730
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,800
were just a pretext to drink
beer and eat sausages.

731
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,700
I met Fernando at one
of these parties.

732
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,800
When I saw him, I immediately knew
that he was the man of my life.

733
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,200
Marjane, are you here?

734
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,900
Ha!

735
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:40,500
That night, I finally understood,
thanks to you.

736
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,500
You revealed me to myself.

737
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:47,500
If it doesn't work with you,
it won't work with any girl.

738
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,700
I know it, now.
I am homosexual.

739
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,800
Ha! It's good to tell it.

740
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,300
Thank you, Marjane. Thank you.

741
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,200
You're welcome.

742
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,900
I swore that I wouldn't let
myself be caught at it again.

743
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,000
I won't let myself
be caught at it again!

744
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,000
Love is a conventional feeling!

745
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:14,400
But "Life is life",
as the other losers sang it.

746
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:19,000
One morning in november,
Markus came into my life.

747
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,800
Shall I walk you back?

748
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,800
I had finally found love.

749
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,300
Nothing was frightening me.
The future looked radiant.

750
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,500
Markus was to become a great writer.

751
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,000
He was reading me extracts from
his piece in his room.

752
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,200
We were as one.

753
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,300
I bought some croissants!

754
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,500
Oh!

755
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,200
Wait.
It's not what you think.

756
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,000
Marjane, I love you!

757
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,200
I love you!

758
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,600
I can't find my brooch.

759
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,200
It's you who stole it!

760
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,100
Leave me alone.

761
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:07,500
I shan't let it rest at that!

762
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,000
Fucking thief!

763
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,000
Go to hell!
I hate you!

764
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,300
You and your fucking dog!

765
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:19,000
Don't talk like that about my dog.
Where are you going?

766
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,400
- You won't get on with it so easily.
- Fuck off!

767
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,000
Fucking thief!
Give me my brooch back!

768
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,300
I'll call the police!
Come back!

769
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:37,400
How could I be so stupid?
This bastard got round me.

770
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,100
I'm a stupid cunt, cunt, cunt!

771
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:44,300
How could I fall in love with
this scumbag, this skinflint?

772
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,100
Shall I take you back?

773
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:49,400
I must fill it up.
Do we split 50-50?

774
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:55,600
This asshole's mouth smelled
like shit with his damned nature!

775
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,000
Fuck! What a stupid cunt are you?

776
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,600
My eye hurts like hell!

777
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,000
- Show me, my love.
- No!

778
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,200
Asshole!
Writer, my ass!

779
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,800
With his shitty piece!
It sucked!

780
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:15,400
This son of a bitch had no balls. He didn't
take my defense in front of his mother.

781
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,700
Ja, Mutter.

782
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,600
A gutless individual, yes!

783
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:25,200
And it was always me
who was buying the junk!

784
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,200
This jerk was waiting
for me in the car.

785
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,400
He wouldn't have been bothered
if I had been arrested.

786
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,600
What a stupid cunt I was!
A stupid cunt!

787
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:49,100
It was my first night in the street.
The first of many.

788
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,400
I had lost some of my relatives
in a revolution.

789
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,100
I had survived a war.

790
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:09,000
And it's a love story that
almost got me.

791
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,700
How goes it?

792
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,100
You're waking up?

793
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,900
Well, that was a close one!

794
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:24,500
It's a good thing we found you.
You've had several bronchitis.

795
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:28,600
I strictly forbid you
to smoke any cigarette.

796
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,600
- Last name?
- Satrapi.

797
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,700
- First name?
- Marjane.

798
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,900
- Where do you live?
- In Iran.

799
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,000
In Iran?

800
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,000
Can I make a phone call?

801
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,000
Hello?

802
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,600
- Daddy?
- Marjane! Is that you?

803
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:48,100
We were worried to death
for the last 2 months!

804
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,700
Daddy... Can I come back?

805
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:54,200
- Of course.
- You won't ask me any question?

806
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,300
No, I promise you.

807
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:58,800
I'm putting you through to your mother.

808
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,400
- Marjane?
- Mom, please, don't cry.

809
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:05,400
Come back home.
We're waiting for you.

810
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,100
- Mom...
- We won't ask you any question.

811
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:09,500
It's a promise.

812
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,600
Don't you have anything forbidden?

813
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:25,600
Pork, alcohol, cards, music,
film, fashion, porno?

814
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,300
No, sir.

815
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,300
Arrange your veil.

816
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:31,200
Yes, sir.

817
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,100
You can go.

818
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,400
It's Marji!

819
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,400
- My daughter...
- I didn't recognize you.

820
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,200
- You're here.
- You've grown.

821
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,400
You're here.

822
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:02,700
I saw the Alborz mountains again.
It had been snowing.

823
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:07,000
My father was wondering if he had
to put the snow chains on his car.

824
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,300
We took the breakfast together,
as before.

825
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,800
My mother had prepared
my favorite omelette.

826
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Nothing had changed,
and yet, I knew that...

827
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:22,400
nothing would be like before.
We talked about many things.

828
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:26,400
My parents kept their word
and didn't ask me any question.

829
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:31,500
I didn't feel very comfortable but I
thought that the nightmare was behind us.

830
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:35,600
The future might get brighter
once the war will be over.

831
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,800
The war is over for sure.

832
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,900
but people forgot why
there's been 8 years of war.

833
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,600
Let her breath.

834
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:45,800
She's coming!

835
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,000
No, no, mom.
It's all right.

836
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,400
The West sold weapons
to both sides.

837
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:57,600
We had been stupid enough
to enter this cynical game.

838
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,000
8 years of war for nothing.

839
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,800
A million dead for nothing.

840
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,300
The last days had been horrifying.

841
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:11,900
A month before the armistice,
Irak bombed Teheran on a daily basis.

842
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:15,400
As if it had to be wiped
out from the map.

843
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:17,600
Just before the ceasefire,

844
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:22,300
the government got scared because
some opponents had fled to Iran.

845
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:27,100
The government was afraid of the threat that
represented the thousands of political prisoners.

846
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:31,300
So the state decided to put
an end to it the hard way.

847
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,700
They proposed to the convicts

848
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:38,600
to renounce their ideals, to promise
to be loyal to the regime

849
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,100
and to serve their sentence

850
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,300
or to be executed.

851
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,200
Most of them were executed.

852
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,600
That's it.

853
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,500
Now streets are
named after martyrs.

854
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:07,200
That's all that's left to famillies.
Street names.

855
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,200
When you walk in Teheran,

856
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,100
it's like being in a cemetery.

857
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,300
You've really grown!

858
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,800
You'll soon be able to
catch the balls of the Lord.

859
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,400
Grandma!

860
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:39,500
Tell me.

861
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:41,000
How was Vienna?

862
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,000
Well, yeah...
It was different.

863
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,300
Do you remember Mina?

864
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,400
Of course, she's my cousin.

865
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:51,100
she got married.
She has two kids.

866
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,400
She's still as stupid as before.

867
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,400
And Shila, do you remember her?

868
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,200
- Yes.
- She's ugly.

869
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:01,300
She has hair on her face.
She looks like a gorilla.

870
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,000
And do you remember Mojdeh?

871
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,000
I remember everybody.

872
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,700
She got a divorce.
He had a small dick.

873
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:12,000
Well, that's what Shahri said.
She told Mehri who told me.

874
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,200
You'll see them all soon.

875
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Oh no!

876
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,300
Well, yes...

877
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,500
You must be speaking German now.

878
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:27,600
Yes, a little.

879
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,200
I know how to say
"Ich liebe dich. "

880
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:34,300
Vienna reminds me of
Empress Sissi.

881
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,600
You saw Romy Schneider?

882
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,600
Marjane...
Stars are shining in the sky

883
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,300
and you in my heart.

884
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:46,300
What a nun face! It's doesn't
look like you lived in Europe.

885
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,500
Really?

886
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,900
Talk a little!
Tell us.

887
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,400
I don't know...

888
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,200
How are the night clubs in Vienna?

889
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:57,300
Well... I didn't go out much.

890
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,400
- I don't like night clubs too much.
- What?!

891
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,200
Did you have sex?

892
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:02,200
Well, yes.

893
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,400
Is it good?

894
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,400
It depends.

895
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,300
What?
You had sex with several men?

896
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:11,000
- Join a nursery school.
- Have your nose fixed.

897
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:32,300
I can't bear it anymore!
It's 40C!

898
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:33,800
I can't stand it any longer.

899
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,800
Damn hairdresser!

900
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,800
- You're not worthy of my son!
- Oh! Anahita!

901
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,100
Hello!

902
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,800
Marjane just went out.

903
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,600
All right, I'll tell her.

904
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,400
Good bye.

905
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:51,400
Stop watching tv!
Didn't you want to try the exam?

906
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,700
You're ruining the
best years of your life.

907
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:59,600
Go and meet people!

908
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,600
Everybody is pissing me off.

909
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,700
Out of 7 million inhabitants,

910
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:06,700
isn't there one person who
you don't think is stupid?

911
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:11,800
There was Kia, my childhood friend,
I wanted to see him.

912
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:15,300
When I saw him,
I understood my grandma's words.

913
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,000
He was almost dead.

914
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:18,700
Kia went to war.

915
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:23,900
He lost an arm and a leg.
I spent a good time with him.

916
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:28,200
We even laughed.
After that, I relativized my miseries.

917
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:32,000
Yes. For him, it's his whole
life that's screwed up.

918
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,700
Yet, he laughed about it.

919
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,000
Hmm.

920
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,200
It's the only way to bear
the unbearable.

921
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:42,400
Whatever I repeat myself,
I can't do it.

922
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,000
It's still unbearable.

923
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:47,800
What I endured lies too heavy on me,
but who can I talk to about it?

924
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,900
- You see?
- Hmm.

925
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,800
My relatives have suffered so much.

926
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,300
I was a stranger in Austria
and I became one here.

927
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,600
I see.
Your sickness has a name.

928
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,200
It's a nervous breakdown.

929
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,200
There are some effective treatments.

930
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,000
I'll prescribe some medication.

931
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:26,400
Don't you want to come with us?
Some fresh air will do you some good.

932
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,800
No. I want to be alone.

933
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:30,800
Don't worry.

934
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,200
So, kiddo, what are you doing here?

935
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,100
Well... I'm dead.

936
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:03,200
My child,
your time hasn't come yet.

937
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:04,400
Oh really?

938
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,100
My daughter,
you'll have to put yourself out.

939
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,100
He's right for once!

940
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:12,000
You've got much to do.
Rise and shine.

941
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,600
Go and do what you have to do.

942
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:24,200
Don't forget that the fight goes on!

943
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,400
Yeah, yeah.
The fight goes on.

944
01:09:57,100 --> 01:10:00,500
Rising up
Back on the street

945
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:04,000
Did my time
Took my chances

946
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,500
Went the distance
Now I'm back on my feet

947
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:12,400
Just a man and his will to survive

948
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:16,700
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the cream of the fight

949
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:21,200
Rising up to the challenge of our rival

950
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:25,400
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night

951
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,300
And he's watching us all in the eye

952
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:31,600
Of the tiger

953
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,400
I'm so hungry!

954
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,800
- Didn't you eat yet?
- She's on a diet.

955
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:46,300
- Are you nuts?
- Her cousin asked her to bring back an issue of Vogue.

956
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:49,600
She's reading it all the time!

957
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:54,300
It looks like you've
made a hit with him.

958
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,800
Enough! I'm ashamed.

959
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:59,300
We'll talk about Botticelli.

960
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:02,300
Venus Birth in particular.

961
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,100
We could also...

962
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:07,400
call it The Spring,
like the other great...

963
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:11,300
.. Botticelli's mythology
shown at the Offices.

964
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:12,900
Hey! You, there!

965
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:14,800
Why are you laughing?

966
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,800
Do you wanna bet that
I'll take off my veil?

967
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,200
- Yeah right!
- How much do we bet?

968
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,600
400 tomans?

969
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:26,300
Go!

970
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:40,800
At the begining of the 90s,
the time of great ideals was over.

971
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,600
After the Revolution, the government
had put so many students in prison

972
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,500
that we didn't dare to talk
about politics anymore.

973
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,200
And the war was finally behind us.

974
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:54,300
We were looking for happiness
so much that we forgot

975
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,600
that we weren't free.

976
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:06,400
Grandma, are you here?

977
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:08,100
Yes, I was here to see you.

978
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:13,000
How nice, you're all
dressed up to the nines!

979
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:14,900
Are you in love?

980
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:17,500
Exactly, I had a date with him.

981
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:21,100
I got a real fright. Guardians
of the Revolution charged.

982
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:23,600
Do you see how I'm made-up?

983
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:27,600
I was stuck. Then I remembered
this guy who was eyeballing me.

984
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,000
You know them.

985
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:32,200
I couldn't pretend to
be a little defenseless girl.

986
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:33,800
Brother!

987
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:35,000
Yes?

988
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:37,100
A man said indecent things to me.

989
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:40,200
Where is he so we can shut him up?

990
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,400
Over there.

991
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:42,600
That's him!

992
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:46,200
Aren't you ashamed?
Don't you have a mother? A sister?

993
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,200
Would you like it
if we insulted them?

994
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:49,600
Ouch!

995
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:53,100
I didn't do anything!
I swear it on my mother!

996
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:55,700
What did they do with the guy?

997
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:57,500
They picked him up.

998
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:58,800
Do you think that's funny?

999
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,400
Yes, don't you?

1000
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:04,400
I think that you're a fucking slut!
That's what I think.

1001
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:10,000
I had no other choice!

1002
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,300
Yes, you had!

1003
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,600
Everybody has a choice.

1004
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:16,200
Everybody always has a choice!

1005
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:22,000
Your grandfather went to prison
for protecting innocents.

1006
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,500
And your uncle Anouche!

1007
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,300
Did you forget why he died?

1008
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,800
What did I teach you?

1009
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Intergrity!

1010
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,800
Does this word ring a bell, miss?

1011
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,600
Shame on you!

1012
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:48,600
The lady with the bag!

1013
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,100
Stop running!
The lady with the bag!

1014
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:55,200
Stop running!
Hey! Stop running!

1015
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:00,900
Madam, why are you running?

1016
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:02,800
I'm late.

1017
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,400
You must not run like that.

1018
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:09,700
When you're running, your behind
makes indecent moves.

1019
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,300
Then don't look at my ass!

1020
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:30,000
Fuck it! Wherever we stand,
we always see the same thing!

1021
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:33,300
Anatomy lesson my ass! The only
thing sticking out is her big nose.

1022
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:36,400
Go to the central university
immediately.

1023
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,400
All the absentees

1024
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,900
will be suspended for 2 weeks.

1025
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,900
We must behave correctly.

1026
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:50,200
The flowers of the Revolution
grew from the blood of our martyrs.

1027
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:54,600
To have an indecent behavior is like
trampling on the blood of the martyrs.

1028
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:57,600
So, I'm asking to all
young ladies to wear

1029
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,700
tighter trousers and
longer cowls.

1030
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:04,600
They must cover their hair
and must not use any make-up.

1031
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,300
Does anybody have a question?

1032
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:09,900
If not, the session is ended.
Yes?

1033
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:12,900
Our cowls are short,
our trousers are indecent,

1034
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:14,700
we put on a lot of make-up, etc.

1035
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:17,600
I spend a lot of
time at the workshop.

1036
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:20,500
I need to be able to move
freely to draw.

1037
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:23,800
A longer cowl makes it difficult.

1038
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:28,500
Our trousers efficiently
hide our shapes.

1039
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:31,100
Knowing that those trousers
are in fashion,

1040
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:34,000
is the religion defending
our integrity...

1041
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:37,200
or is it simply
opposed to fashion?

1042
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:40,200
You make comments about us
while the brothers...

1043
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,300
have many different clothes
and hair cuts.

1044
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:45,800
Sometimes, we can even
see their underwears.

1045
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:48,200
Why is it that as a woman,

1046
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:52,600
I'm not allowed to feel anything
when watching them,

1047
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:56,100
while men can get excited on
our shorter cowls?

1048
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:01,800
It's great. It's as if you had
cut their little dick.

1049
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:06,500
Take off this fucking cowl.
It makes me claustrophobic.

1050
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:08,800
I tend to forget it.

1051
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,400
Don't ever forget it.

1052
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:15,600
It's fear that makes us
lose our self-awareness.

1053
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:19,000
It's also changing us into cowards.

1054
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,600
You had guts.

1055
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,200
I'm proud of you.

1056
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,300
- I want to leave.
- To go where?

1057
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,100
To the USA or to Europe.

1058
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,100
Where in Europe?

1059
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:33,200
I can't stand living
here any longer.

1060
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,400
What about us?

1061
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:35,900
You'll come with me.

1062
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:40,600
- I don't want to leave.
- That's because you're still nostalgic.

1063
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,100
Sooner or later,
people will disgust you.

1064
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:46,500
You can die in the West,
nobody cares.

1065
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,400
Don't worry.

1066
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,000
We'll manage.

1067
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,100
What's your relationship with him?

1068
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:01,400
Good.

1069
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,700
We'll call your parents.

1070
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:06,600
Either they pay
or it will be some lashing.

1071
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,400
When your mother and I were 15,
we used to walk together holding hands.

1072
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,700
Oh la la!

1073
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:25,300
And yet it was in this country.

1074
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:32,700
You know, that's how
the situation is now.

1075
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:35,200
You have to be careful.

1076
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:38,900
I think it's better if you're
not seen outside anymore.

1077
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:52,600
This situation is unbearable.
We can't go anywhere.

1078
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,100
We're like prisoners.
It's not a life!

1079
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:59,500
Yeah... We can only get married.

1080
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:01,800
So?

1081
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,000
- Did you cry, mom?
- No.

1082
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:35,000
I always wanted you to be
independent, educated and cultured.

1083
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,500
And now you're getting married
at 21 years old!

1084
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:41,700
I want you to leave Iran
to be free and liberated!

1085
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:42,900
It's fine.

1086
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:45,600
Trust me.
I know what I'm doing.

1087
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:59,000
- Did you see the car keys?
- Huh?

1088
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:01,400
I left them here.

1089
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:02,500
I don't know.

1090
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,600
They were here.

1091
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:29,900
We don't share anything anymore.

1092
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:32,700
You're the ideal couple to us.

1093
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:34,200
Ideal couple, my ass!

1094
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:36,700
What? You want my picture?

1095
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,300
Asshole!

1096
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,700
Not so long ago,
you were saying that you loved him.

1097
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:46,400
It's impossible to know...

1098
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:47,800
until we live under the same roof.

1099
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
What will you do?
Are you gonna get a divorce?

1100
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:53,400
I don't know.

1101
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,400
My sister left
her husband last year.

1102
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,500
As soon as she got a divorce,

1103
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:02,900
all men wanted to
have sex with her.

1104
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:05,000
The butcher proposed her.

1105
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:08,200
Then the baker and the greengrocer.

1106
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,700
And even the beggars.

1107
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:14,200
Men are convinced that
their thing is irresistible

1108
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:18,400
and that a divorced woman will
accept since she's not a virgin anymore.

1109
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:23,100
Stay with your husband
as long as you can.

1110
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Something's wrong?

1111
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:36,400
Don't get yourself
into such a state!

1112
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,400
Excuse me.

1113
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:40,000
What is this sorrow for?

1114
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,200
Grandma!

1115
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:43,600
It's terrible!

1116
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:45,900
What's so terrible?

1117
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:49,200
I think that... I think that
I don't love Reza anymore.

1118
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:51,600
I think we'll part.

1119
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,500
So this is your terrible thing?

1120
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:56,600
I thought somebody had died!

1121
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:00,200
You've no idea what you're saying!
I have a heart condition.

1122
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,900
And you're talking to me like that!

1123
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:06,800
All those tears for a simple divorce!

1124
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:13,300
Listen to me carefully.

1125
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:16,200
I did it 55 years ago.

1126
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:19,400
Back then,
no one was getting a divorce.

1127
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:23,200
I knew that I would be happier
alone than with a damned nuisance!

1128
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:24,200
But...

1129
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:25,500
No buts!

1130
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:28,600
A first wedding is a rough
work for the second one.

1131
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:31,400
It will be better next time.

1132
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:39,800
You're crying because
you were wrong.

1133
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,400
It's hard to accept your own
mistakes, isn't it?

1134
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,900
Where were you?

1135
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:25,700
I was very worried.

1136
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:28,600
Nima is dead.

1137
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:30,900
Huh? What?

1138
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:33,400
Nima is dead.

1139
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:37,400
I'm leaving you.

1140
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:43,900
The time had come for me to leave.

1141
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:46,100
I decided to go to France.

1142
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:49,600
I had to wait 3 months for a visa.

1143
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:54,300
I went to the Caspian sea
with grandma

1144
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:57,700
where I filled my lungs with
this unique air.

1145
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:01,600
An air like nowhere else.

1146
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:14,900
Then I promised grandpa
that he'd be proud of me.

1147
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,200
Then I wnet behind the prison

1148
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:25,400
where my uncle Anouche was resting,

1149
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,500
somewhere next to
thousands of innocents.

1150
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:31,500
I promised him to try to be true
to myself as much as possible.

1151
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:48,000
Then, one day, the time
to leave had come.

1152
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:51,000
My father cried, as usual.

1153
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,600
you're leaving forever.
You're a free woman.

1154
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,800
Iran of today isn't for you.

1155
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,700
I forbid you to come back.

1156
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:04,300
Yes, mom.
Grandma!

1157
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:06,300
My sweet little girl!

1158
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:28,200
I never saw my grandma again.

1159
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:32,200
She died a little later.

1160
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:35,800
Freedom always has a price.

1161
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:22,200
Ah! What a shitty weather!

1162
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,000
Where do you come from?

1163
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,300
Iran.

1164
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,200
Grandma, you always smell good.
How are you doing?

1165
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:38,200
I pick up jasmine
flowers every morning

1166
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:41,200
and I put them in my bra.

1167
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:44,200
This way, I always smell good.

1168
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,900
Wow! It's great!

1169
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:55,300
