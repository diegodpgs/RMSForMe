1
00:00:10,055 --> 00:00:14,458
<i>What I'd like to do today is</i>
<i>get your version of what happened.</i>

2
00:00:15,127 --> 00:00:18,062
- You mean the truth?
- Of course.

3
00:00:18,564 --> 00:00:22,261
First, just state your name and
your occupation for the record.

4
00:00:23,268 --> 00:00:25,327
Egg Shen, bus driver.

5
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:30,098
Bus driver.
What kind of bus and where, please?

6
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:37,010
Tour bus. Bus for tourists.
San Francisco Chinatown.

7
00:00:37,115 --> 00:00:43,145
Thank you. Now, before we get
to the meat of this thing,

8
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:46,554
do you at the present time
have any knowledge

9
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:49,389
of the whereabouts of
a Mr Jack Burton or his truck?

10
00:00:49,494 --> 00:00:53,191
- Oh, God. Will you leave him alone?
- Mr Shen, please.

11
00:00:53,298 --> 00:00:59,567
You could be in a great deal of trouble. Half
a city block explodes in a ball of green flame.

12
00:00:59,638 --> 00:01:02,698
Green flame! All hell is breaking loose here.

13
00:01:02,774 --> 00:01:05,368
And there are people
who say you're involved,

14
00:01:05,444 --> 00:01:10,507
that you might be responsible,
that you're a very dangerous man.

15
00:01:10,582 --> 00:01:15,383
- Now, if you're protecting Jack Burton...
- You leave Jack Burton alone!

16
00:01:16,521 --> 00:01:20,548
We are in his debt. He showed great courage.

17
00:01:25,864 --> 00:01:28,662
OK.

18
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:32,533
But if I'm gonna be your attorney,
there are a few things I have to know

19
00:01:32,604 --> 00:01:35,072
that still don't make any sense to me.

20
00:01:35,173 --> 00:01:37,232
Like...

21
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,274
do you really believe in magic?

22
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,040
You mean Chinese black magic?

23
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:47,141
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

24
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:52,748
Are you still serious about this? And
monsters and ghosts as well, I suppose?

25
00:01:52,824 --> 00:01:56,021
Sure. And sorcery.

26
00:01:57,195 --> 00:02:02,633
And I suppose that you expect me
to believe in sorcery as well?

27
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:05,169
- Of course.
- Why?

28
00:02:05,237 --> 00:02:07,569
Because it's real.

29
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:09,698
How can I know that, Mr Shen?

30
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:13,869
- How?
- Yes, how? Help me out here.

31
00:02:14,613 --> 00:02:16,205
Please.

32
00:02:22,788 --> 00:02:25,484
See? That was nothing.

33
00:02:26,725 --> 00:02:29,785
But that's how it always begins.

34
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:32,261
Very small.

35
00:02:55,821 --> 00:03:00,918
<i>This is Jack Burton at the Pork-Chop Express</i>
<i>and I'm talkin' to whoever's listenin'.</i>

36
00:03:01,026 --> 00:03:03,221
It's like I told my last wife.

37
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:06,321
I says "Honey, I never drive
faster than I can see."

38
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:10,367
"Besides that, it's all in the reflexes."

39
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:21,502
You just listen to the Pork-Chop Express and
take his advice on a dark and stormy night.

40
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,515
When some wild-eyed maniac
grabs your neck,

41
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,518
taps the back of your head
up against a barroom wall,

42
00:03:27,586 --> 00:03:31,579
he looks you crooked in the eye
and asks you if you've paid your dues,

43
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:37,651
you just stare that big sucker back in the eye
and remember what Jack Burton always says.

44
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:42,723
"Have you paid your dues, Jack?"
"Yes, sir, the check is in the mail."

45
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:05,223
Well, you see, I'm not sayin' that I've been
everywhere and I've done everything.

46
00:04:05,323 --> 00:04:09,316
But I do know it's a pretty
amazing planet we live on here,

47
00:04:09,394 --> 00:04:14,764
and a man would have to be some kinda fool
to think we're all alone in this universe.

48
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:37,909
I can't believe you're stuck on even.
This is odd!

49
00:05:38,016 --> 00:05:40,814
All right, even! Another even! Come on!

50
00:05:40,886 --> 00:05:43,855
You want one more? All right!

51
00:05:48,693 --> 00:05:51,594
- What do we got? He can't count.
- Even!

52
00:05:51,663 --> 00:05:55,531
Learn how to play
some fan-tan here, buddy-boy!

53
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:57,898
Three!

54
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:20,882
Heaven and earth, boys. What can I tell ya?

55
00:06:23,662 --> 00:06:27,928
You like that one?
What did he say, Wang? In English?

56
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:31,764
Something about beginner's luck.
It doesn't translate. But he quits.

57
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:37,900
He quits? What is this? It's a brand-new day
and he's still got 100 bucks in his pocket.

58
00:06:37,976 --> 00:06:42,879
I'm not gonna complain, because I'll bet
I'd have lost my shirt in the next 20 minutes.

59
00:06:42,948 --> 00:06:46,042
Breaks my heart to do this,
but the next time I'm down here,

60
00:06:46,117 --> 00:06:50,144
you'll gang up on Jack so fast
he won't know what the hell happened.

61
00:06:50,255 --> 00:06:52,723
- No.
- Ah, sure. Easy come, easy go, Wang.

62
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:53,951
No!

63
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,761
Not next time. Now.

64
00:07:00,966 --> 00:07:04,129
Is this gonna get ugly now? I hope not.

65
00:07:04,202 --> 00:07:07,467
I thought what we were here,
racial differences aside,

66
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:11,134
was a coupla old friends,
both of us Californians.

67
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:13,803
Shit, Wang. It's only a game.

68
00:07:17,382 --> 00:07:19,350
Nothin' or double.

69
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:22,511
This knife cuts this bottle in half.

70
00:07:24,522 --> 00:07:25,784
- Nothin' or double.
- Bullshit.

71
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,484
- Nothin' or double.
- Why, man? Don't be stupid.

72
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,620
- I need the money.
- I got near a thousand bucks here, Wang.

73
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,925
1,148, Jack.

74
00:07:40,005 --> 00:07:42,838
OK. But not that bottle.

75
00:07:45,643 --> 00:07:47,110
This bottle.

76
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:53,712
OK.

77
00:07:53,785 --> 00:07:56,652
You're outta your mind, Wang. God bless ya!

78
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:11,765
- It's all in the reflexes.
- It always works at home.

79
00:08:11,836 --> 00:08:17,604
Have me over for dinner some year and prove
it. In the meantime, pay up: $1,148 times two.

80
00:08:17,675 --> 00:08:20,576
- I don't have that kind of money.
- I didn't hear that.

81
00:08:20,645 --> 00:08:25,947
- I'm just a poor Chinese boy, you know?
- You own a restaurant. That's more than me.

82
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:30,886
Yeah, right. What I meant was,
I don't got that kind of money on me.

83
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:33,958
That's what I thought you meant.
Where's your truck?

84
00:08:34,225 --> 00:08:36,352
- I gotta go somewhere.
- No, you don't.

85
00:08:36,461 --> 00:08:39,862
I do. How about we meet in my restaurant
in a few hours? I pay then.

86
00:08:39,964 --> 00:08:42,558
- You pay now. Where you gotta go?
- The airport.

87
00:08:42,634 --> 00:08:45,967
- Yeah, right. Over my dead body.
- If need be.

88
00:08:47,472 --> 00:08:51,169
- I'll follow you.
- You don't trust me? That makes me sad.

89
00:08:51,242 --> 00:08:55,235
- It reminds me of an old Chinese joke.
- Save it. I'll give you a lift. Get in.

90
00:08:55,313 --> 00:08:59,773
- You were gonna follow me, Jack.
- I know, then I came to my senses.

91
00:09:00,385 --> 00:09:03,513
- So who are we pickin' up?
- A girl. I don't wanna talk about it.

92
00:09:03,621 --> 00:09:05,885
- A girl? Where from?
- Peking.

93
00:09:06,724 --> 00:09:10,683
This is a big day in my life. I should
have gone home and gotten 40 winks.

94
00:09:10,795 --> 00:09:13,593
A girl from China? All right, I never done that.

95
00:09:13,665 --> 00:09:18,466
I picked up girls from everywhere else,
but never from China. Is she pretty?

96
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:23,204
- I'm gonna marry her, Jack.
- Oh, God!

97
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:27,540
I've known her since we were kids.
I haven't seen her in five years.

98
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:30,341
I came here alone.
I worked my fingers till they bled.

99
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:32,541
Before you knew me, I slept on the floor.

100
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,949
I saved every nickel to bring her here
because I love her so much.

101
00:09:36,054 --> 00:09:42,152
I can't eat, sleep or think properly without her
anymore. She'll put my whole life in order.

102
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,956
Boy, listen to me. Real tough guy.

103
00:09:45,063 --> 00:09:48,157
You sound a little nervous, pal.

104
00:09:48,566 --> 00:09:54,163
That's why the bottle didn't slice. My mind
and my spirit are goin' north and south.

105
00:10:02,313 --> 00:10:06,977
<i>Flight number 26 has just arrived</i>
<i>at gate number seven.</i>

106
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,586
Whoa. Who is that?

107
00:10:15,894 --> 00:10:18,727
She has green eyes.
You know how rare that is, Jack?

108
00:10:18,796 --> 00:10:23,597
- How can you tell from here?
- Not her. She's trouble. Miao Yin.

109
00:10:24,402 --> 00:10:27,371
Beautiful green eyes, like creamy jade.

110
00:10:27,906 --> 00:10:29,271
Trouble, huh?

111
00:10:42,187 --> 00:10:45,315
- Can I ask you a serious question?
- Absolutely not.

112
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:49,827
- Would you considerjumping right into...
- Sure, but not with a man in your condition.

113
00:10:49,928 --> 00:10:54,490
- What's wrong with my condition?
- Try standing downwind where I am.

114
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:58,000
- It's Miller time.
- You know what I say when it's Miller time?

115
00:11:00,038 --> 00:11:02,506
Wait a minute!

116
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:04,975
- Don't!
- Don't what?

117
00:11:05,043 --> 00:11:10,709
The Lords of Death. Street gang. Punks
from Chinatown. What are they doing here?

118
00:11:44,782 --> 00:11:46,443
Tara!

119
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:52,353
Miao Yin!

120
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,792
Excuse me.

121
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,708
Let's you and me have a little talk, friend.

122
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:15,472
What?

123
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,639
Where'd you get that?

124
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,319
Wait a minute, pal.

125
00:12:29,427 --> 00:12:30,485
Get that one!

126
00:12:38,469 --> 00:12:40,835
Come on, Jack!

127
00:12:57,455 --> 00:12:59,150
Where?

128
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:02,552
Call the cops!

129
00:13:24,582 --> 00:13:26,948
Son of a bitch must pay!

130
00:13:30,988 --> 00:13:33,855
What's goin' on, Wang?
Why'd they steal your girl?

131
00:13:33,925 --> 00:13:38,362
You tell me! How come it's not safe to walk
in Central Park or to give a stranger a lift?

132
00:13:38,463 --> 00:13:43,992
- Because the world's full of crazy people.
- The American girl knew something was up.

133
00:13:44,102 --> 00:13:46,332
Stay away from her. She's a lawyer.

134
00:13:46,404 --> 00:13:49,373
She's a what? Oh, come on!

135
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:53,668
- What the hell?
- They got a clubhouse where they hang out.

136
00:13:53,778 --> 00:13:55,973
- To sharpen their knives?
- I can't ask you to...

137
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,105
- Where is it?
- Thank you, Jack.

138
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:09,091
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
I am Mr Egg Shen, with this wonderful tour.

139
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,822
Sit back and enjoy yourselves, see?

140
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:17,595
Long time ago, Chinese men with
gold-rush fever flooded into California.

141
00:14:17,702 --> 00:14:21,194
We call <i>Gum Shan</i> - Mountain of Gold, see?

142
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:24,502
Leaving behind their wives and children.

143
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:29,173
Working for years to complete
the transcontinental railroad,

144
00:14:29,247 --> 00:14:33,581
saving all their pennies.
And then they sent for their families

145
00:14:33,651 --> 00:14:37,712
to help build this beautiful Chinatown
you see outside your window

146
00:14:37,822 --> 00:14:40,848
this fine warm day.

147
00:15:11,022 --> 00:15:14,014
- Go right, down that alley. Lords of Death!
- What alley?

148
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:15,991
Go right! Now!

149
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,116
- Where the hell are we?
- Come on, Jack.

150
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,383
Excuse me, ma'am.
I don't suppose you saw a...

151
00:15:50,628 --> 00:15:52,425
No.

152
00:15:52,497 --> 00:15:54,692
Keep moving.

153
00:16:22,093 --> 00:16:24,254
- What is it? A parade?
- A funeral.

154
00:16:24,328 --> 00:16:28,025
- A fighting tong. They're Chang Sings.
- A fighting tong?

155
00:16:28,099 --> 00:16:32,058
Don't panic, Jack.
They're OK. They're good guys.

156
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:36,840
Maybe we should try a different alley.
What do you say?

157
00:16:42,713 --> 00:16:46,547
Wang, these guys, these Sing Dings.
They got enemies?

158
00:16:46,651 --> 00:16:49,176
- Wing Kong.
- Who wear red turbans?

159
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:51,255
Holy shit!

160
00:16:51,322 --> 00:16:53,586
These guys are animals, Jack.

161
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:28,341
- What's happening, Wang?
- Chinese standoff.

162
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:30,353
A what?

163
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:32,616
Don't make a sound.

164
00:20:41,352 --> 00:20:42,944
Who's that?

165
00:21:52,756 --> 00:21:55,657
No questions! Just get outta here, Jack!

166
00:22:13,177 --> 00:22:15,168
Jack!

167
00:22:20,017 --> 00:22:22,508
- I think it was Lo Pan.
- Who?

168
00:22:39,937 --> 00:22:42,201
- Don't look, Jack!
- I already did.

169
00:22:42,306 --> 00:22:44,399
- Who? I mean, what?
- Lo Pan. Come on!

170
00:22:44,475 --> 00:22:48,434
- I can't see!
- It's OK. It's only temporary. Over here.

171
00:22:49,847 --> 00:22:51,906
Bend over.

172
00:22:52,917 --> 00:22:55,442
Yeah, yeah.

173
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:59,080
I ran straight through him, Wang.
How the hell did I do that?

174
00:22:59,156 --> 00:23:01,750
- You didn't. It only appeared that way.
- Right!

175
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:06,853
- Lords of Death, Jack.
- OK, I'm goin' home. Keep your money.

176
00:23:06,931 --> 00:23:09,092
- Hey, Wang Chi!
- Lookin' for us?

177
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:12,533
- They know your name.
- That's not good. Let's go!

178
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:17,632
- My truck!
- Forget it!

179
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:43,091
Lords of Death controlled by the Wing Kong,
Jack. Just errand boys for the Wing Kong.

180
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:47,695
Great! Who wiped out all those
yellow turbans? Those guys were winning.

181
00:23:53,477 --> 00:23:55,877
He says it was the Storms. The Three Storms.

182
00:23:55,946 --> 00:23:58,346
Three guys did all that? Listen.

183
00:23:58,415 --> 00:24:02,351
What about that...
whatever it was I ran straight through?

184
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:03,681
Fast!

185
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:17,833
Lucky us. We made it.

186
00:24:17,935 --> 00:24:21,803
- All right, where's my truck? I'm outta here.
- Isn't your truck insured?

187
00:24:21,905 --> 00:24:24,430
- Of course it is.
- Then smart man gets it later.

188
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:28,033
- Smart man calls the cops.
- Cops got better things to do than get killed.

189
00:24:28,145 --> 00:24:29,134
So do I!

190
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:36,413
Mutual Fidelity Insurers of Sacramento.

191
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,752
Well, there's gotta be a listing, honey.
I pay 'em six G's a year in premiums.

192
00:24:40,824 --> 00:24:46,854
China is here, Mr Burton.
The Chang Sing, the Wing Kong.

193
00:24:47,564 --> 00:24:51,591
- They've been fighting for centuries.
- What does that mean? "China is here"?

194
00:24:51,668 --> 00:24:56,628
I don't know what that means. All I know is,
this Lo Pan character comes out of thin air

195
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:02,178
in the middle of an alley, while his buddies
fly around, cuttin' everybody to shreds,

196
00:25:02,246 --> 00:25:06,342
and he stands there, waiting for me
to drive my truck straight through him,

197
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,011
- with light comin' out of his mouth!
- Jack, please.

198
00:25:12,456 --> 00:25:14,981
- When did this happen?
- It didn't, not like he says.

199
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:20,964
Yeah, it did. Two hours ago. Tall guy, weird
clothes. First you see him, then you don't.

200
00:25:21,031 --> 00:25:23,625
Lo Pan appeared on the street?

201
00:25:24,601 --> 00:25:27,832
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't want to alarm you, Uncle.

202
00:25:27,905 --> 00:25:32,308
I'm gonna tell you about an accident
and I don't wanna hear "act of God," OK?

203
00:25:32,443 --> 00:25:35,970
All right, look. What's your name?
Mine's Jack Burton.

204
00:25:36,046 --> 00:25:39,573
- Good afternoon, Mr Wong.
- Eddie Lee, meet my friend, Jack Burton.

205
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:43,051
- Eddie's the new maître d' here.
- And a whole lot more.

206
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,715
Well, I don't know my policy number.
It's in the glove compartment.

207
00:25:46,824 --> 00:25:49,657
Just look under B-U-R-T-O-N, will ya?

208
00:25:49,726 --> 00:25:52,320
- Jack Burton?
- Yeah.

209
00:25:52,729 --> 00:25:56,096
Boy. The guy you always told me about.

210
00:25:57,067 --> 00:26:00,833
- Then that was your abandoned truck.
- Abandoned, like hell!

211
00:26:00,904 --> 00:26:03,099
Hello. Hello?

212
00:26:03,207 --> 00:26:04,799
Oh, Christ!

213
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:07,935
Bad news. The Lords of Death
stole it after you ran away.

214
00:26:08,045 --> 00:26:11,742
- They stole my truck?
- Take it easy, Jack. You're with friends.

215
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:14,215
- We'll find it for you.
- Damn right you will.

216
00:26:14,284 --> 00:26:19,153
And my money. And time is money to a guy
like me. And your phone is dead, by the way.

217
00:26:19,256 --> 00:26:24,717
- How do you think I feel? I lost a whole girl!
- The Lords of Death were only on ajoyride.

218
00:26:24,828 --> 00:26:26,955
Not acting on orders from the Wing Kong.

219
00:26:27,064 --> 00:26:30,693
They just wanted a girl to sell
and Miao Yin got in the way.

220
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:33,258
Plus, the skirmish you guys stumbled into.

221
00:26:33,337 --> 00:26:37,865
Lo Pan, the word is, ordered the boss of
the Chang Sings, Mr Lem Lee, assassinated.

222
00:26:37,941 --> 00:26:40,307
- That was his funeral.
- It was a war, Eddie.

223
00:26:40,377 --> 00:26:44,905
- What are you doing here?
- Don't panic. It's only me, Gracie Law.

224
00:26:44,982 --> 00:26:46,142
Great.

225
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,515
Just passing the neighborhood
on a dark and stormy night?

226
00:26:49,586 --> 00:26:52,646
- This is my neighborhood.
- Sure it was a war.

227
00:26:52,723 --> 00:26:57,057
And anybody that showed up was gonnajoin
Lem Lee in the hell of being cut to pieces.

228
00:26:57,127 --> 00:26:59,857
- Hell of being what?
- The Chinese have a lotta hells.

229
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:04,299
- And what the hell is Gracie Law doing here?
- She can't get enough of me.

230
00:27:04,368 --> 00:27:06,996
He wishes. Look, you know me.

231
00:27:07,104 --> 00:27:10,540
I'm always pokin' my nose where it
doesn't belong and, I admit it,

232
00:27:10,607 --> 00:27:12,905
this mix-up is my fault, sort of.

233
00:27:12,976 --> 00:27:16,878
But I have it on good advice that the punks
thatjumped me and took his truck,

234
00:27:16,947 --> 00:27:21,111
they took the girl they kidnapped to the
White Tiger's for a quick sale. Who was she?

235
00:27:21,185 --> 00:27:25,713
- My fiancée. The White Tiger's?
- Oh, God. I'm sorry.

236
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:29,384
If we go tonight, we can buy her back.
A warrant's too complicated,

237
00:27:29,493 --> 00:27:32,223
- violence out of the question...
- Hold it! Slow down.

238
00:27:32,329 --> 00:27:34,797
- I'm feelin' like an outsider here.
- You are!

239
00:27:34,898 --> 00:27:38,334
Jack, listen. I need more of your help.
I can't pay you today, OK?

240
00:27:38,402 --> 00:27:40,927
- Shit.
- How can I? I need the cash for Miao Yin.

241
00:27:41,004 --> 00:27:45,907
- And it's gonna cost. She's got green eyes.
- Seriously? That's an extra.

242
00:27:45,976 --> 00:27:48,604
It's like leather bucket seats: Double the price.

243
00:27:48,712 --> 00:27:53,513
- Look, this Lo Pan I ran over... through...
- Has spirit-medium powers.

244
00:27:53,617 --> 00:27:58,452
Like the immortals.
His flesh and his bones are atomized.

245
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:01,319
He becomes the dream.

246
00:28:01,391 --> 00:28:04,189
- What?
- That's an exaggeration, Jack, I promise.

247
00:28:04,261 --> 00:28:05,660
Please, help me.

248
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:08,122
I got a great idea.

249
00:28:20,978 --> 00:28:23,037
- Relax.
- I am relaxed.

250
00:28:23,146 --> 00:28:26,638
Look, this is as far as I go,
because I'm a dead giveaway, see?

251
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:30,686
I'd go in there with you, but they know
my face and they'd wanna push it in.

252
00:28:30,787 --> 00:28:33,415
- Not while I'm around.
- It's all up to you now, Jack.

253
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,685
My destiny rests in your capable hands.

254
00:28:35,792 --> 00:28:38,386
- I'll do my best.
- Make them drop their guard.

255
00:28:38,462 --> 00:28:40,089
- I'll try.
- Look stupid.

256
00:28:40,197 --> 00:28:42,028
He does.

257
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,198
Boy, it sure is rainin' cats and dogs.

258
00:28:47,037 --> 00:28:50,097
The cab driver said...
He told me that I could...

259
00:28:50,207 --> 00:28:53,438
Well, that the White Tiger would...

260
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:56,579
Just a minute, please.

261
00:29:02,653 --> 00:29:07,090
Excuse me for a second, guys.
I think I know that car.

262
00:29:11,695 --> 00:29:14,129
What's she doing now?

263
00:29:14,231 --> 00:29:16,199
Strange girl.

264
00:29:21,238 --> 00:29:23,798
That building there. The White Tiger.

265
00:29:23,874 --> 00:29:27,810
God, it's creepy. Do we have to go in?
Because I will, if we have to.

266
00:29:27,878 --> 00:29:31,211
I'll go anywhere or do anything
to get my story. It's my big break.

267
00:29:31,281 --> 00:29:35,843
Just sit tight. We've got one of our best men
inside right now, stirring the pot.

268
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:56,303
How do you do, ma'am? Henry Swanson's
my name and excitement's my game.

269
00:29:56,373 --> 00:29:59,740
- Cash or charge?
- Gosh! Cash, I guess.

270
00:29:59,843 --> 00:30:02,038
I mean, it's not deductible, is it?

271
00:30:04,314 --> 00:30:07,283
Mrs O'Toole will take care of your needs.

272
00:30:07,351 --> 00:30:09,478
Boy, I wish these were in color.

273
00:30:09,553 --> 00:30:13,319
Because what I really am
in the mood for is a girl with green eyes.

274
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:16,052
And price is no object, Mrs O'Toole.

275
00:30:16,126 --> 00:30:20,153
Fresh off the boat's the way I like 'em.
The more exotic the better.

276
00:30:20,263 --> 00:30:23,061
Chinese girls do not come with green eyes.

277
00:30:41,785 --> 00:30:44,310
- Too long. Let's go in.
- It's only been ten minutes.

278
00:30:44,388 --> 00:30:46,481
Give the guy a chance.

279
00:30:48,892 --> 00:30:51,759
- So how long you been in the US of A?
- Three months.

280
00:30:51,828 --> 00:30:54,763
- Where from?
- Hong Kong.

281
00:30:54,831 --> 00:30:59,928
What happens? You stay here a while?
Old girls leave, new girls come in?

282
00:31:00,103 --> 00:31:03,698
Maybe. Take your tie off, please.

283
00:31:03,807 --> 00:31:07,004
Yeah, I know what you mean.
My wife gave it to me for Christmas.

284
00:31:11,148 --> 00:31:12,581
Holy shit!

285
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:50,078
Green explosions? People flyin' in and out?
That was not real. I wanna talk to the cops.

286
00:32:50,146 --> 00:32:53,115
I want my truck back.
Now where the hell am I?

287
00:32:53,216 --> 00:32:56,481
- My office. Sit down.
- You sleep in your office?

288
00:32:56,553 --> 00:33:01,456
What I need to get straight is...
These Storms, what are they? Magicians?

289
00:33:01,525 --> 00:33:05,359
- Yeah, sort of. It's hard to explain.
- Try real hard.

290
00:33:05,462 --> 00:33:08,363
If the Storms have Miao Yin,
there's one place they'd go.

291
00:33:08,465 --> 00:33:12,526
Lo Pan. The godfather of Little China,
Mr David Lo Pan.

292
00:33:12,636 --> 00:33:15,901
You mean the Lo Pan that's
chairman of the National Orient Bank

293
00:33:15,972 --> 00:33:18,167
and owns the Wing Kong Trading Company,

294
00:33:18,275 --> 00:33:21,870
but who's so reclusive
that no one has laid eyes on him in years?

295
00:33:21,945 --> 00:33:24,379
Who the hell are you, anyway?

296
00:33:24,481 --> 00:33:27,973
I'm Margo Litzenberger.
I'm with the <i>Berkeley People's Herald.</i>

297
00:33:28,084 --> 00:33:32,487
I've been trying to get somebody from
the press to listen to me about this, Burton.

298
00:33:32,556 --> 00:33:37,493
It's not possible that you saw David Lo Pan.
The bastard's afraid to show his face.

299
00:33:37,561 --> 00:33:40,496
- He's got more enemies...
- He's got Miao Yin. I'm going!

300
00:33:40,564 --> 00:33:42,930
- Are you nuts?
- Who's that?

301
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:45,968
It's OK, Tara. You can go back to sleep.

302
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:48,367
- From the airport.
- This morning, sure.

303
00:33:48,471 --> 00:33:52,999
That's why I was there. I was protecting her
civil rights, making sure she gets a chance.

304
00:33:53,109 --> 00:33:57,011
This is just so shocking. I mean,
I mustjust be so monumentally naive.

305
00:33:57,113 --> 00:33:59,343
- You are.
- Now we have to grab your fiancée...

306
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:02,579
Wait a minute! I'm a reasonable guy,

307
00:34:02,686 --> 00:34:05,280
but I've experienced
some unreasonable things.

308
00:34:05,355 --> 00:34:09,155
- It depends on how you look at it.
- The hell it does! So somebody

309
00:34:09,225 --> 00:34:11,591
- tell me what is goin' on!
- The truth?

310
00:34:11,695 --> 00:34:13,822
- I can take it.
- We don't know.

311
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:20,831
- I'm going now, alone if I have to!
- Where? It's pouring out.

312
00:34:20,971 --> 00:34:24,600
- Lo Pan's. The Wing Kong Exchange.
- The Wing Kong Exchange?

313
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:28,508
The most dangerous den of madmen
in Chinatown? You can't waltz in like...

314
00:34:28,578 --> 00:34:33,208
Like the wind. Yes, I can, Miss Law.
My mind and my spirits are as one.

315
00:34:33,316 --> 00:34:36,217
- As two. I said I was comin'.
- I'd go with you...

316
00:34:36,319 --> 00:34:39,220
I know. There's a problem with your face.

317
00:34:39,322 --> 00:34:43,383
OK! You people sit tight, hold the fort
and keep the home fires burning.

318
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:47,021
If we're not back by dawn, call the president.

319
00:34:56,806 --> 00:35:02,403
- This is gonna take crackerjack timing.
- Total concentration. You ready, Jack?

320
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:04,572
I was born ready.

321
00:35:08,652 --> 00:35:10,813
I love working nights.

322
00:35:10,887 --> 00:35:12,878
Don't get up. Phone company.

323
00:35:13,023 --> 00:35:16,459
All right, boys, where's the main panel?
Probably through here.

324
00:35:25,402 --> 00:35:27,370
Wang.

325
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:39,671
Good work, Jack.
I think they actually fell for it.

326
00:35:42,118 --> 00:35:46,452
Well, last time we had this problem was
on account of squirrels chewin' the wires.

327
00:35:46,523 --> 00:35:50,687
- I'd better locate the central junction box.
- I think it's down there.

328
00:35:55,699 --> 00:35:57,257
What does that say?

329
00:35:57,333 --> 00:36:00,268
- Hell of boiling oil.
- You're kidding!

330
00:36:00,336 --> 00:36:02,634
Yeah, I am. It says "Keep out."

331
00:36:07,077 --> 00:36:09,511
We've got to do something!

332
00:36:14,317 --> 00:36:19,311
Goat butts against a hedge
and its horns become entangled.

333
00:36:20,223 --> 00:36:24,523
- I don't think I've had the pleasure.
- Miss Gracie Law, Mr Egg Shen.

334
00:36:24,627 --> 00:36:27,221
Egg's kind of our local authority on Lo Pan.

335
00:36:27,297 --> 00:36:29,857
- He's helping us out.
- It has been almost two hours.

336
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:33,300
- Let's go over there, beat down the door...
- No, Miss Law.

337
00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:38,568
We have to gather our strength,
because now there's clouds and thunder.

338
00:36:38,675 --> 00:36:42,076
The image of difficulty at the beginning.

339
00:36:42,145 --> 00:36:45,945
But finally we shall bring order out of chaos.

340
00:36:50,987 --> 00:36:53,649
- Look.
- Yeah.

341
00:36:53,723 --> 00:36:56,692
What you got here is two
people dragging a third.

342
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,853
Miao Yin!

343
00:37:13,276 --> 00:37:16,973
- You did that, right?
- I guess so. I hope so.

344
00:37:22,585 --> 00:37:24,883
Jack, check this out.

345
00:37:26,189 --> 00:37:28,282
So what is this? Chinese or somethin'?

346
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:31,020
- Countin' backwards?
- Not backwards. Downwards.

347
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:46,498
Of course the Chinese mix everything up.
Look at what they have to work with.

348
00:37:46,576 --> 00:37:51,445
There's Buddhism, Confucianism
and Taoist alchemy and sorcery.

349
00:37:51,748 --> 00:37:55,946
We take what we want and leave the rest.
Just like your salad bar.

350
00:37:56,019 --> 00:38:00,046
But there is one thing
even David Lo Pan must acknowledge.

351
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:06,652
All movement in the universe is caused by
tension between positive and negative furies.

352
00:38:06,763 --> 00:38:11,200
- So when the furies are out of balance...
- As they are in Lo Pan, who is cursed.

353
00:38:11,267 --> 00:38:14,430
Then the people
turn into demons and live forever.

354
00:38:14,537 --> 00:38:18,837
Repulsive and evil,
existing only to plague the living.

355
00:38:18,942 --> 00:38:24,209
Well then, what you're saying is
this David Lo Pan... What is he? A ghost?

356
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:30,344
Plays at being a man.
A creature of vast, dark, destructive power.

357
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:35,883
All right, out this hatch and up the cable.
Does that sound like a brilliant idea or what?

358
00:38:35,992 --> 00:38:38,893
The cable is three stories high
and covered with grease.

359
00:38:38,995 --> 00:38:42,897
Exactly. It's real and we can touch it,
so at least we know where we stand.

360
00:38:42,999 --> 00:38:44,796
Yeah, in deep shit.

361
00:38:47,503 --> 00:38:50,063
- What?
- What the hell?

362
00:38:51,975 --> 00:38:53,465
- Shit!
- See?

363
00:38:53,576 --> 00:38:56,477
You think they'd let us
walk in and out like the wind?

364
00:38:56,579 --> 00:38:59,275
Yes. I thought that was
your whole damn point!

365
00:38:59,382 --> 00:39:01,714
My point was to find Miao Yin at any cost!

366
00:39:01,818 --> 00:39:04,719
- This is salt water, Wang.
- And get your truck back!

367
00:39:04,821 --> 00:39:08,450
- I'll buy another one.
- But there's only one Miao Yin!

368
00:39:36,452 --> 00:39:38,511
Jesus Christ! Where are we?

369
00:39:38,621 --> 00:39:41,089
Hell of the upside-down sinners!

370
00:39:55,538 --> 00:39:59,736
Hey, you! Come on over here
and fight like a man!

371
00:40:38,915 --> 00:40:42,476
Shit, Jack. I don't like the looks of this.

372
00:40:45,121 --> 00:40:47,521
- Where are we, Wang?
- You are nowhere!

373
00:41:13,783 --> 00:41:15,717
Oh, boy.

374
00:41:15,785 --> 00:41:18,754
Look, we came here
to see David Lo Pan, all right?

375
00:41:19,455 --> 00:41:21,116
David Lo Pan?

376
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:24,785
- Then you have succeeded, Mr Burton.
- What, you?

377
00:41:25,728 --> 00:41:28,856
- I don't get this at all. I thought...
- Shut up, Mr Burton!

378
00:41:28,965 --> 00:41:33,026
- You are not put upon this world to "get it."
- Come on! Lo Pan is like...

379
00:41:33,136 --> 00:41:35,001
Nothing you can understand.

380
00:41:35,071 --> 00:41:40,373
There are many mysteries and unanswerable
questions, even in a life as short as yours.

381
00:41:40,443 --> 00:41:44,072
The way I see it, it doesn't mean
we shouldn't ask. Where's my truck?

382
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:48,583
You are not looking for a truck. You're
looking for a girl. A girl with green eyes.

383
00:41:48,651 --> 00:41:51,984
- Yes.
- She must be something extraordinary.

384
00:41:52,055 --> 00:41:54,683
Or I'm not about to waste another 2,000 years.

385
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:58,283
There can't be many Chinese girls
with green eyes these days.

386
00:41:58,428 --> 00:42:01,693
- There are not. Never were.
- So beggars can't be choosers.

387
00:42:01,798 --> 00:42:03,857
But I can!

388
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:07,500
Tell me about Miao Yin.

389
00:42:07,603 --> 00:42:09,867
What province is she from? Hunan?

390
00:42:10,606 --> 00:42:14,702
Her mother? Her father?
He must be a holy man. I must know.

391
00:42:14,811 --> 00:42:18,303
You got a tongue, Dave. Ask her yourself.

392
00:42:23,486 --> 00:42:28,253
Mr Burton, if you have an influence over
your youthful friend, you better exert it now.

393
00:42:28,324 --> 00:42:32,420
Otherwise I will send both of you to
the hell where people are skinned alive.

394
00:42:32,495 --> 00:42:34,861
It's that simple. Understand?

395
00:42:35,898 --> 00:42:39,664
- Are you crazy? Is that your problem?
- No, he means it, Jack.

396
00:42:39,735 --> 00:42:44,866
My problem is this place.
This place is my tomb. I'm buried here.

397
00:42:44,941 --> 00:42:51,073
A young man, a king, a warrior,
is entombed in this old man's crippled body.

398
00:42:52,748 --> 00:42:55,273
And all I need is a woman, Mr Burton,

399
00:42:55,351 --> 00:42:58,650
a special kind of woman
with dragon-green eyes,

400
00:42:58,721 --> 00:43:04,125
to make me whole and young again, so that I
may rule the universe from beyond the grave.

401
00:43:04,227 --> 00:43:07,560
- Ch'ing-ti. The God of the East.
- Who, him? This guy?

402
00:43:07,663 --> 00:43:09,654
No, not me, Mr Burton.

403
00:43:11,033 --> 00:43:15,561
My demon. The god I must appease
in order to regain my heart, my blood.

404
00:43:16,172 --> 00:43:19,903
A girl with green eyes to satisfy Ch'ing-ti,

405
00:43:19,976 --> 00:43:22,877
a girl brave enough
to embrace the naked blade.

406
00:43:22,945 --> 00:43:25,140
- When I find her, I will marry her.
- Never!

407
00:43:25,248 --> 00:43:27,682
Ch'ing-ti will be happy and my curse lifted.

408
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:30,583
You can rule the universe
from beyond the grave.

409
00:43:30,686 --> 00:43:33,086
- Indeed!
- Or check into a psycho ward.

410
00:43:33,156 --> 00:43:35,590
Whichever comes first.

411
00:43:35,691 --> 00:43:40,560
What, I'm supposed to buy this shit? 2,000
years and he can't find a broad to fit the bill?

412
00:43:40,663 --> 00:43:43,757
Come on, Dave, you must be doin'
somethin' seriously wrong.

413
00:43:43,866 --> 00:43:49,566
There have been others, to be sure.
There are always others, are there not?

414
00:43:49,672 --> 00:43:53,802
You seem to be one who knows
the difficulties between men and women,

415
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:56,276
how seldom it works out.

416
00:43:56,812 --> 00:44:00,179
And yet we all keep trying, like fools.

417
00:44:02,285 --> 00:44:08,087
Who are these people? Friends of yours?
Now this really pisses me off to no end!

418
00:44:08,157 --> 00:44:11,752
- Come on, stick around!
- Where's Miao Yin? In this building?

419
00:44:11,827 --> 00:44:13,419
- Safe.
- Where is she?

420
00:44:13,563 --> 00:44:17,090
Safe. Safer with me
than any creature on earth!

421
00:44:18,601 --> 00:44:21,593
Go ahead. You want bad publicity?
Give us the runaround.

422
00:44:21,704 --> 00:44:25,902
But this woman has a deadline,
and her pen is mightier than your sword.

423
00:44:25,975 --> 00:44:28,773
- Yeah.
- No visitors.

424
00:44:28,844 --> 00:44:33,178
- I don't make the policy around here.
- Come on, man! Give 'em a tour.

425
00:44:33,249 --> 00:44:35,649
What's it gonna hurt?

426
00:44:36,752 --> 00:44:39,050
I can help you.

427
00:45:07,984 --> 00:45:10,452
- Are you OK, Jack?
- Yeah.

428
00:45:12,755 --> 00:45:16,782
We're in a room.
No windows, a few skeletons.

429
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:19,987
- Where's the light coming from?
- The floor.

430
00:45:35,411 --> 00:45:39,006
With the easing of trade restrictions,

431
00:45:39,081 --> 00:45:44,018
next year we'll start importing
a lot of strange things from Peking.

432
00:45:44,086 --> 00:45:47,112
What sort of strange things?

433
00:45:47,223 --> 00:45:49,657
Are we going up or down?

434
00:45:49,725 --> 00:45:51,818
It feels like down.

435
00:46:11,514 --> 00:46:14,039
Great. Thank you, Jack.

436
00:46:14,116 --> 00:46:19,110
I think we've come up. First we went down.
Now they've brought us up.

437
00:46:20,222 --> 00:46:25,125
Two, three feet thick, I'll bet. Probably
welded shut and covered with brick by now.

438
00:46:25,227 --> 00:46:29,129
- Don't give up, Jack.
- OK. Let's just chew our way outta here!

439
00:46:29,231 --> 00:46:31,859
Lo Pan has plans for us,
or we'd be dead doornails.

440
00:46:31,934 --> 00:46:37,065
Which Lo Pan? Little old basket case
on wheels, or the ten-foot-tall roadblock?

441
00:46:37,139 --> 00:46:42,099
- One and the same person, Jack.
- You know something you're not tellin' me.

442
00:46:42,178 --> 00:46:44,578
Myths and legends.

443
00:46:45,348 --> 00:46:48,681
- I don't wanna insult you.
- No, no. Go ahead.

444
00:46:49,485 --> 00:46:51,077
Insult me.

445
00:46:53,055 --> 00:46:56,513
It's about all sorts of scary things:
An ancient army of the dead,

446
00:46:56,592 --> 00:47:00,153
the Spirit City and monkey sacrifices.

447
00:47:00,262 --> 00:47:02,389
The First Sovereign Emperor of China,

448
00:47:02,498 --> 00:47:06,491
that mad monarch who federated our
seven warring states, defeated Lo Pan

449
00:47:06,569 --> 00:47:11,871
and imposed upon him
that horrible curse of no flesh in 272 BC.

450
00:47:12,775 --> 00:47:17,144
A lot of Chinese hear these things
when we're kids, then we grow up,

451
00:47:18,114 --> 00:47:20,207
and pretend not to believe them.

452
00:47:20,816 --> 00:47:23,751
- No horseshit, Wang.
- No horseshit, Jack.

453
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:29,189
I don't blame you. I'm Chinese and I don't
even wanna believe it, but it's for real.

454
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:31,782
Sorcery, the Chinese black magic.

455
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:39,225
Blindfolds!

456
00:47:58,354 --> 00:48:00,447
You make one move...

457
00:48:06,629 --> 00:48:10,531
Now, let's try that again.
Don't make me kill you, tough guy.

458
00:48:12,368 --> 00:48:14,336
Come on, Jack!

459
00:48:14,804 --> 00:48:16,863
- Come on!
- How?

460
00:49:11,393 --> 00:49:13,384
- Great work, Jack.
- Yeah.

461
00:49:13,462 --> 00:49:18,695
We're all in: Me, Gracie and Margo. Uncle Chu
and Egg are in Egg's bus, ready to get us out.

462
00:49:18,834 --> 00:49:20,301
- Right.
- Here, Jack.

463
00:49:20,402 --> 00:49:22,461
I'll trade ya.

464
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:26,232
All right, which way?
Fast, before they wake up.

465
00:49:26,308 --> 00:49:28,936
There, I think. Down there.

466
00:49:35,284 --> 00:49:37,343
No pathetic excuses.

467
00:49:38,354 --> 00:49:44,554
I smell the blood of human beings. Find
them. Boil them until their flesh falls off.

468
00:49:45,027 --> 00:49:47,086
You heard me!

469
00:50:43,218 --> 00:50:45,311
Empty.

470
00:50:47,623 --> 00:50:50,319
I need you, Miao Yin.

471
00:50:50,726 --> 00:50:55,322
You, whose eyes flash like emerald lightning.

472
00:50:56,365 --> 00:51:00,324
Ch'ing-ti, make me flesh again soon.

473
00:51:02,404 --> 00:51:03,962
Please.

474
00:51:05,641 --> 00:51:07,541
Let's go. It's clear.

475
00:51:13,382 --> 00:51:15,441
Safety!

476
00:51:19,355 --> 00:51:20,947
Wang!

477
00:51:26,829 --> 00:51:29,559
First time you ever plugged somebody?

478
00:51:30,199 --> 00:51:32,167
- Course not.
- Come on!

479
00:51:34,003 --> 00:51:35,800
You wanna go up or down?

480
00:51:35,871 --> 00:51:37,998
- Up or down?
- Up.

481
00:52:00,663 --> 00:52:04,656
All has become strange.

482
00:52:05,634 --> 00:52:11,573
A world so unreal
and yet, at once, so frightening.

483
00:52:35,097 --> 00:52:38,066
Open up or I'll blow his head off!

484
00:52:41,236 --> 00:52:44,137
Open! Or he dies in the name of Ch'ing-ti

485
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:48,107
and your souls speed with his
to the hell of the oily dragon!

486
00:53:15,304 --> 00:53:17,465
- You all right?
- Yeah.

487
00:53:22,177 --> 00:53:24,077
- Margo!
- Jack!

488
00:53:24,146 --> 00:53:27,912
- Where's Gracie?
- On the floor next door. She's a wildcat.

489
00:53:27,983 --> 00:53:31,680
- How are you gonna spring us?
- I have no idea.

490
00:54:09,224 --> 00:54:11,715
That way maybe.

491
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:17,389
Wang, haul ass!

492
00:54:32,214 --> 00:54:34,148
Come on, keep movin'!

493
00:54:35,751 --> 00:54:37,309
Margo, jump in!

494
00:54:38,954 --> 00:54:41,252
- In there? Are you nuts?
- Go!

495
00:55:12,588 --> 00:55:15,056
- Where's Margo?
- I don't know.

496
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,427
Where are we?

497
00:55:19,494 --> 00:55:21,792
- Where's Eddie?
- Beats me.

498
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,993
Where's Jack?

499
00:55:28,837 --> 00:55:30,896
Jack!

500
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:34,968
Jack?

501
00:55:36,979 --> 00:55:39,038
Jack!

502
00:55:42,284 --> 00:55:47,654
- Sorry, I'm just thrilled to be alive.
- Yeah, sure. Let's go.

503
00:55:54,496 --> 00:55:58,091
- It's like some giant garbage disposal.
- I think it is, sort of.

504
00:55:58,233 --> 00:56:02,226
Will you just stop rubbing
your body up against mine?

505
00:56:02,304 --> 00:56:04,431
I can't concentrate when you do that.

506
00:56:04,506 --> 00:56:08,499
What a pig you are, Burton! I mean, really!

507
00:56:11,046 --> 00:56:15,039
- Where's Jack?
- It's OK. Everybody relax. I'm here.

508
00:56:15,117 --> 00:56:18,553
Jack, I know where we are.
This is a central... what do you call it?

509
00:56:18,654 --> 00:56:21,418
- Sewer?
- Yeah. Water comes in up there.

510
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:26,257
Seawater from the bay fills this room. They
divert it through pipes to different chambers.

511
00:56:26,328 --> 00:56:29,855
I bet up there's where
we first got on that elevator.

512
00:56:57,592 --> 00:57:01,084
All right, we're almost outta here.
From here on, it gets normal.

513
00:57:01,163 --> 00:57:03,393
Offices, storerooms: A nice false front.

514
00:57:03,498 --> 00:57:06,956
I count to three, open the door, and we go.

515
00:57:07,069 --> 00:57:09,003
- Everybody got that?
- Ready?

516
00:57:09,104 --> 00:57:11,595
Follow the leader. One, two, three.

517
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:17,373
We may be trapped.

518
00:57:20,415 --> 00:57:22,747
Hide!

519
00:57:22,818 --> 00:57:26,584
- Hide?
- Hide! They only saw me!

520
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:32,983
We fight together, Jack. Do or die.

521
00:58:23,945 --> 00:58:25,469
Time to go.

522
00:58:30,218 --> 00:58:33,381
The bus is right outside in the parking lot.

523
00:58:54,576 --> 00:58:59,479
Here's the deal. I run interference and
you bring up the rear. Can you handle that?

524
00:58:59,581 --> 00:59:00,513
Can you?

525
00:59:01,049 --> 00:59:04,507
Well, what a night's work!
You got a problem like that again,

526
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:07,452
- you reach for the sky!
- Let's go!

527
00:59:09,691 --> 00:59:11,784
Come on, come on.

528
00:59:12,994 --> 00:59:16,088
- You're doin' real good, guys.
- Come on, Jack!

529
00:59:18,033 --> 00:59:20,729
Let's go! Open the doors!

530
00:59:24,139 --> 00:59:26,266
- Hurry!
- Move it, Egg!

531
00:59:27,909 --> 00:59:29,843
Duck!

532
00:59:45,894 --> 00:59:49,022
We made it. Holy shit, we made it!

533
00:59:49,698 --> 00:59:52,565
- Where's Miao Yin?
- Inside.

534
00:59:53,135 --> 00:59:54,864
Somewhere inside.

535
00:59:57,906 --> 00:59:59,533
Where's Gracie?

536
01:00:15,957 --> 01:00:19,120
Put me down, you overstuffed monster!

537
01:00:23,265 --> 01:00:26,098
Let me go! Let me go!

538
01:01:04,206 --> 01:01:06,333
What does it mean?

539
01:01:06,408 --> 01:01:09,138
Two girls with green eyes?

540
01:01:09,211 --> 01:01:11,338
After all these years.

541
01:01:11,413 --> 01:01:16,976
You bastards! Unchain me! You're not
gonna get away with this. Where's Lo Pan?

542
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,150
This one has fire as well!

543
01:01:21,223 --> 01:01:25,159
Listen, I've had it
up to here with you maniacs.

544
01:01:25,227 --> 01:01:29,357
I wanna see that disgusting
flesh-peddler David Lo Pan in person.

545
01:01:29,431 --> 01:01:34,459
Unless the coward's afraid to see
an unarmed girl one-on-one!

546
01:01:35,036 --> 01:01:37,129
Where is he?

547
01:01:46,381 --> 01:01:51,250
You know what this is? This is like
some radical <i>Alice In Wonderland.</i>

548
01:01:51,353 --> 01:01:55,483
- That's what this is.
- Then you've got a bestseller on your hands.

549
01:01:55,624 --> 01:02:01,585
- Call the police. You're not a one-man army.
- Cops got better things to do than get killed.

550
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,763
Here he is, Jack.

551
01:02:06,835 --> 01:02:10,464
No, these are our friends.
These are the Chang Sings.

552
01:02:10,605 --> 01:02:13,870
- Any of 'em savvy English?
- Hey, man. Who is this guy?

553
01:02:13,975 --> 01:02:15,806
All right. You got any guns?

554
01:02:15,877 --> 01:02:21,315
Not against Lo Pan, but here's one for you
to make you feel better, like Dirty Harry.

555
01:02:21,416 --> 01:02:24,476
I'll stick with these. You comin' with us, Egg?

556
01:02:24,619 --> 01:02:29,488
Of course, Jack. It's my destiny. Besides,
if I don't you'll never make it out alive.

557
01:02:29,624 --> 01:02:32,184
- I'm on board too then.
- Yeah, sure, kid.

558
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:36,026
- You can't keep the press out. It's America.
- You're not going back there.

559
01:02:36,097 --> 01:02:38,691
You're stayin' here with Eddie and Uncle Chu.

560
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,826
- Eddie? But he's...
- He's got a crush on you.

561
01:02:42,237 --> 01:02:46,503
- You mean like you've got on Gracie?
- Are you kidding? I just want my truck back.

562
01:02:46,641 --> 01:02:49,940
What do I know?
She's not even your type. All brains.

563
01:02:50,045 --> 01:02:52,104
Come on, let's go!

564
01:03:00,855 --> 01:03:04,621
Play your cards right, you live to talk about it.

565
01:03:27,515 --> 01:03:29,642
Oh, boy.

566
01:03:30,785 --> 01:03:33,879
Are you OK? Are you Miao Yin?

567
01:03:33,955 --> 01:03:37,254
Yes. Miao Yin.

568
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:40,323
- Who are you?
- Lo Pan.

569
01:03:40,395 --> 01:03:43,956
You have come to seek me out
with your green eyes.

570
01:03:44,065 --> 01:03:46,090
Yes.

571
01:03:46,167 --> 01:03:48,135
- No, no.
- Yes.

572
01:03:50,004 --> 01:03:55,670
- What's going on here? Some kind of?
- Magic. The darkest magic.

573
01:03:55,744 --> 01:04:02,013
My soul swims in it, scattered across time,
trapped in the world of formlessness.

574
01:04:02,417 --> 01:04:06,410
Until I find her and marry her.

575
01:04:06,521 --> 01:04:07,920
Marry her?

576
01:04:07,989 --> 01:04:13,188
The girl with green eyes.
The girl who can tame the burning blade.

577
01:04:15,375 --> 01:04:19,812
Miao Yin or Grace Law.

578
01:04:30,224 --> 01:04:34,456
- Great start. It's the other way.
- The front door will get you nowhere.

579
01:04:34,528 --> 01:04:38,191
- Here, let me hold that.
- A brave man likes to feel nature on his face.

580
01:04:38,265 --> 01:04:41,496
And a wise man has enough sense
to get in out of the rain.

581
01:04:53,614 --> 01:04:56,310
- He lives here?
- He owns the block. He's a rich guy.

582
01:04:56,416 --> 01:04:59,715
- Rich? This place is a dump, Wang.
- To Western eyes.

583
01:04:59,853 --> 01:05:02,720
The stuff in these bottles is priceless.

584
01:05:04,091 --> 01:05:07,083
Well, all set?

585
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:10,655
Yeah. Ready when you are, Egg.

586
01:05:29,983 --> 01:05:31,883
- Jack next.
- Where does it go?

587
01:05:31,952 --> 01:05:34,887
- Down. Lo Pan is down there.
- Down where?

588
01:05:34,955 --> 01:05:37,947
- Where is the universe?
- Come on, Jack. Don't be afraid.

589
01:05:38,058 --> 01:05:40,117
Afraid? Are you kidding?

590
01:05:54,341 --> 01:05:58,607
- Where in the hell are we?
- Underneath Chinatown.

591
01:06:59,239 --> 01:07:01,571
That is not water.

592
01:07:01,642 --> 01:07:04,133
Black blood of the earth.

593
01:07:04,211 --> 01:07:08,477
- Do you mean oil?
- I mean black blood of the earth.

594
01:07:08,582 --> 01:07:13,781
A thousand years ago, huge earthquakes
turned the world upside down.

595
01:07:16,056 --> 01:07:18,547
Many normal people were killed.

596
01:07:20,794 --> 01:07:24,855
Many unnatural people roam free

597
01:07:24,998 --> 01:07:29,560
to commit great offenses against the gods.

598
01:09:15,909 --> 01:09:20,903
They have survived the burning blade,
tamed the savage heart.

599
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:26,082
I will marry both women.

600
01:09:27,988 --> 01:09:30,582
Prepare them.

601
01:09:45,205 --> 01:09:47,298
What is that?

602
01:09:48,975 --> 01:09:52,968
- It sounds like...
- Something breathing underwater?

603
01:09:53,113 --> 01:09:54,740
Yeah.

604
01:10:04,558 --> 01:10:06,617
You will come out no more!

605
01:10:06,726 --> 01:10:10,389
What? What'll come out no more?

606
01:10:10,464 --> 01:10:12,728
Come on.

607
01:10:12,799 --> 01:10:14,858
Dammit!

608
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:29,774
Miao Yin?

609
01:11:08,388 --> 01:11:10,481
Hey, Wang!

610
01:11:10,590 --> 01:11:13,184
- Egg!
- Jack, come on!

611
01:11:27,941 --> 01:11:31,399
It's OK, Jack. Wing Kong storeroom.
Emergency provisions.

612
01:11:31,478 --> 01:11:34,447
We're inside Lo Pan's domain.

613
01:11:34,514 --> 01:11:36,448
Christ!

614
01:11:39,252 --> 01:11:40,344
Later.

615
01:11:40,453 --> 01:11:45,049
We're getting close. Real close.
And now for some more bad news. Ready?

616
01:11:45,125 --> 01:11:49,653
- This gets worse? Come on!
- 2,258 years ago

617
01:11:49,729 --> 01:11:52,254
the First Sovereign Emperor...

618
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:57,329
He subjugated Lo Pan, made him of no flesh.

619
01:11:58,371 --> 01:12:02,239
- Only an evil dream.
- Get to the goddamn point, Egg.

620
01:12:02,309 --> 01:12:07,508
In order to be whole again, he had to find
this certain girl of his prophecy,

621
01:12:07,581 --> 01:12:10,277
and marry her to appease the God of the East.

622
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:13,478
But to appease the emperor,
he had to kill her.

623
01:12:13,553 --> 01:12:15,384
Kill her? No!

624
01:12:15,488 --> 01:12:19,584
Well, let's go. What are we talkin'
Chinese history for when we gotta get...

625
01:12:19,693 --> 01:12:23,151
We are getting ready to strike the final blow.

626
01:12:23,296 --> 01:12:26,925
- If we reach Lo Pan...
- When we reach Lo Pan.

627
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,798
...then the power in this flask
will be our only hope

628
01:12:29,903 --> 01:12:34,806
against the Bodhisattva of the underworld,
the ultimate evil spirit.

629
01:12:35,909 --> 01:12:39,902
Yes. Only a dream can kill a dream.

630
01:12:40,313 --> 01:12:43,146
I've waited for this for a long time, Jack.

631
01:12:44,384 --> 01:12:46,978
The evil dream will die.

632
01:12:53,426 --> 01:12:54,620
Wing Kong outside.

633
01:13:21,421 --> 01:13:24,948
- Were they real?
- Yeah. Dressed for Lo Pan's wedding.

634
01:13:25,025 --> 01:13:27,118
What's in the flask? Magic potion?

635
01:13:27,193 --> 01:13:29,661
- Yeah.
- Thought so. Good. Do we drink it?

636
01:13:29,763 --> 01:13:31,526
- Yeah.
- Good. Thought so.

637
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:12,395
I am the past,
come back to haunt you, Lo Pan!

638
01:14:14,641 --> 01:14:19,010
My God, no! Please!
What is that? Don't tell me.

639
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:23,448
A guardian. What it sees, Lo Pan knows.

640
01:14:23,516 --> 01:14:25,984
They have returned.

641
01:14:26,052 --> 01:14:30,216
And this time they are not alone.
Egg Shen is with them.

642
01:14:30,290 --> 01:14:35,990
Little bastard sorcerer has brought them
through the Bog of the Dead Trees.

643
01:14:36,062 --> 01:14:37,791
Egg Shen?

644
01:14:37,864 --> 01:14:42,824
Egg Shen! You have come
a long ways to find me, but it is too late.

645
01:14:42,902 --> 01:14:47,236
There are two girls with green eyes,
and I will marry them both.

646
01:14:47,307 --> 01:14:50,674
And then I will sacrifice Gracie Law
to appease my emperor,

647
01:14:50,744 --> 01:14:55,010
and live out my earthly pleasures
with Miao Yin.

648
01:14:57,650 --> 01:15:00,881
That's right, Egg Shen.
The best of two worlds.

649
01:15:07,761 --> 01:15:10,321
You never know till you try.

650
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:12,522
Let's get outta here.

651
01:15:22,976 --> 01:15:25,877
You know what I don't like?
Where is everybody?

652
01:15:25,945 --> 01:15:28,243
Preparing for Lo Pan's wedding.

653
01:15:38,792 --> 01:15:42,592
We should not be in here, not this easily.
It's a setup, I'm tellin' ya.

654
01:15:42,695 --> 01:15:46,131
Lo Pan is about to take his queen.
He's too busy to care.

655
01:15:46,199 --> 01:15:48,963
So where is he, Egg? Where?

656
01:16:20,567 --> 01:16:22,626
- Jack, here!
- What?

657
01:16:26,206 --> 01:16:28,299
- Hollow.
- Fuck it.

658
01:16:32,946 --> 01:16:36,643
- I know. It's an elevator. It only goes down.
- Yeah, look.

659
01:16:36,749 --> 01:16:40,651
- Hey, all right!
- Time for the medicine!

660
01:16:48,394 --> 01:16:52,023
- Cheers!
- This does what again, exactly?

661
01:16:52,131 --> 01:16:54,759
Huge buzz.

662
01:16:55,668 --> 01:16:57,568
Good!

663
01:16:57,637 --> 01:17:01,937
You can see things no one else can see,
do things no one else can do.

664
01:17:02,008 --> 01:17:04,272
- Real things?
- As real as Lo Pan.

665
01:17:04,377 --> 01:17:08,438
- What more can a guy ask for?
- The six-demon bag!

666
01:17:08,581 --> 01:17:12,278
Terrific. A six-demon bag.
Sensational. What's in it, Egg?

667
01:17:12,385 --> 01:17:15,183
Wind! Fire! All that kind of thing.

668
01:17:15,255 --> 01:17:17,780
Here's to the army and navy
and the battles they have won.

669
01:17:17,857 --> 01:17:20,587
Here's to America's colors,
the colors that never run.

670
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:23,356
May the wings of liberty never lose a feather.

671
01:17:38,411 --> 01:17:41,847
I feel pretty good. You know, I'm not...

672
01:17:41,915 --> 01:17:44,907
I'm not scared at all. I just feel kind of...

673
01:17:45,919 --> 01:17:48,683
- I feel kind of invincible.
- Me too.

674
01:17:48,788 --> 01:17:52,724
- I got a very positive attitude about this.
- Good. Me too.

675
01:17:58,598 --> 01:18:01,089
Is it gettin' hot in here, or is itjust me?

676
01:18:01,401 --> 01:18:04,302
Ch'ing-ti! Ch'ing-ti!

677
01:18:05,138 --> 01:18:08,869
Great Ch'ing-ti, equal with heaven,

678
01:18:08,942 --> 01:18:14,903
come into our presence
and witness this holy matrimony.

679
01:18:15,014 --> 01:18:18,711
- Miao Yin.
- And the ultimate evil spirit.

680
01:18:24,023 --> 01:18:27,424
And now, my beloved disciples,

681
01:18:27,493 --> 01:18:29,927
the moment of truth.

682
01:18:30,029 --> 01:18:32,520
The needle of love.

683
01:18:36,069 --> 01:18:39,061
- I'd like to shoot that bastard.
- Not until he's married.

684
01:18:39,138 --> 01:18:41,766
- Then he's flesh.
- Then it's too late.

685
01:18:41,874 --> 01:18:44,104
Ch'ing-ti!

686
01:18:44,177 --> 01:18:48,978
You, who shake the heavens
and descend from the east,

687
01:18:49,082 --> 01:18:52,779
all I ask in order to conquer this universe

688
01:18:52,885 --> 01:18:57,254
is that you grant me flesh and blood.

689
01:18:59,058 --> 01:19:02,152
Yes! Guide my hand

690
01:19:02,962 --> 01:19:07,126
as I insert this needle into Miao Yin.

691
01:19:08,001 --> 01:19:11,869
Let him complete the ceremony.
Then he is ours for certain!

692
01:19:11,938 --> 01:19:14,498
Come, my love. Give it to me.

693
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,585
It's working!

694
01:19:31,224 --> 01:19:33,317
I'm mortal!

695
01:19:41,768 --> 01:19:43,759
Look out, guys!

696
01:19:59,352 --> 01:20:01,013
No way!

697
01:21:04,517 --> 01:21:06,849
Come, Miao Yin, it won't hurt.

698
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:09,147
Shit!

699
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:18,687
Take her.

700
01:22:41,714 --> 01:22:44,012
Peasant magic!

701
01:23:19,385 --> 01:23:21,444
You never could beat me, Egg Shen.

702
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:29,210
- It's me.
- Are you all right?

703
01:24:29,288 --> 01:24:32,451
- Never mind me. We gotta get Lo Pan.
- Where is he?

704
01:24:32,525 --> 01:24:33,890
Wang!

705
01:24:34,026 --> 01:24:35,789
Come on.

706
01:24:37,797 --> 01:24:39,856
Pull it apart. Come on!

707
01:25:07,093 --> 01:25:11,359
- Where does this go?
- Up. To Lo Pan's office. It's cooler up there.

708
01:25:11,464 --> 01:25:14,524
- From there we can...
- Do you have a gun, I hope?

709
01:25:14,633 --> 01:25:18,069
- I have a knife.
- A knife? He's 12 feet tall!

710
01:25:18,137 --> 01:25:21,436
Seven. Don't worry.
I can handle him. I took something.

711
01:25:21,507 --> 01:25:24,237
I can see things no one else can see.

712
01:25:25,478 --> 01:25:29,073
- Why are you dressed like that?
- I was getting married.

713
01:25:29,148 --> 01:25:34,313
He was marrying both of us,
just because my eyes are green too.

714
01:25:43,562 --> 01:25:46,156
Oh, God. Is this really happening?

715
01:25:53,406 --> 01:25:56,705
- Look into my eyes.
- No! Never!

716
01:25:56,776 --> 01:26:00,712
I have suffered so much pain and agony.
Look at me!

717
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:04,580
No! I don't understand. I don't belong to you!

718
01:26:04,683 --> 01:26:08,517
No, you don't. You belong to Ch'ing-ti.

719
01:26:08,587 --> 01:26:11,420
I must sacrifice you,
but I love you and I need you.

720
01:26:11,524 --> 01:26:13,719
No!

721
01:26:13,793 --> 01:26:15,988
Here, take her! Take the bitch!

722
01:26:16,128 --> 01:26:18,926
- Master, you are flesh!
- I am?

723
01:26:19,565 --> 01:26:22,557
I am! It worked!

724
01:26:22,635 --> 01:26:25,433
Ch'ing-ti is appeased.

725
01:26:25,805 --> 01:26:31,175
Now we must satisfy the First
Sovereign Emperor by destroying this!

726
01:26:31,243 --> 01:26:33,438
Not so fast, gentlemen.

727
01:26:33,546 --> 01:26:37,209
Is it too much to ask, Thunder?
Kill him! For me!

728
01:26:37,316 --> 01:26:42,151
It won't solve anything, Dave. Too many
people have been droppin' like flies already

729
01:26:42,221 --> 01:26:45,816
and where's that gettin' us? Nowhere, fast.

730
01:26:45,925 --> 01:26:49,361
Nah, you know what Jack Burton
always says at a time like this?

731
01:26:49,428 --> 01:26:52,420
- Who?
- Jack Burton. Me!

732
01:27:00,773 --> 01:27:02,934
Old Jack always says

733
01:27:03,442 --> 01:27:05,569
"What the hell?"

734
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:32,803
It's a good knife.

735
01:27:35,241 --> 01:27:37,072
Goodbye, Mr Burton.

736
01:28:01,333 --> 01:28:03,824
It's all in the reflexes.

737
01:28:06,939 --> 01:28:08,668
Wang!

738
01:28:16,348 --> 01:28:18,509
You all right?

739
01:28:18,617 --> 01:28:20,744
- Hey, thanks.
- Wait a minute.

740
01:28:56,522 --> 01:28:58,581
I don't think he's gonna stop!

741
01:29:02,928 --> 01:29:04,452
Come on!

742
01:29:24,316 --> 01:29:26,784
- We got a problem.
- There!

743
01:29:58,517 --> 01:30:00,917
Come on, Jack!

744
01:30:02,821 --> 01:30:04,914
Jump, Jack!

745
01:30:15,034 --> 01:30:17,935
- This whole place is melting!
- Hello! Hello!

746
01:30:18,804 --> 01:30:22,934
- How'd you get up there?
- It wasn't easy! Stand aside!

747
01:30:27,646 --> 01:30:29,841
Take it away!

748
01:30:49,468 --> 01:30:51,402
Hang onto this.

749
01:30:53,605 --> 01:30:55,596
Watch out, Wang Chi!

750
01:31:05,050 --> 01:31:07,109
Go for it, Wang!

751
01:31:27,873 --> 01:31:30,740
- Go!
- Come on, Jack, hurry!

752
01:31:32,745 --> 01:31:35,305
There's my truck... My truck!

753
01:31:35,447 --> 01:31:37,881
Get in.

754
01:31:59,471 --> 01:32:01,564
- They took the key.
- Do you have a spare?

755
01:32:01,673 --> 01:32:04,574
Course I do, but it's underneath the...

756
01:32:07,146 --> 01:32:10,946
- What was that?
- 6.9 on the Richter scale. Hang on!

757
01:32:19,458 --> 01:32:21,949
- Sorry.
- Don't you know how to drive this thing?

758
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:23,652
Relax.

759
01:32:37,676 --> 01:32:39,940
Stop! Red light!

760
01:32:44,116 --> 01:32:46,584
Take it easy. OK, we made it.

761
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:49,212
Yeah.

762
01:32:49,321 --> 01:32:53,485
Look at that.
Doesn't that make you feel good?

763
01:32:53,559 --> 01:32:55,618
Terrific.

764
01:32:56,929 --> 01:32:59,193
The light's green. You can go.

765
01:33:17,816 --> 01:33:20,944
- What are you doin', Jack?
- I'll be right back.

766
01:33:21,019 --> 01:33:23,544
Where are you goin', Egg?

767
01:33:24,223 --> 01:33:26,316
My work's done.

768
01:33:27,025 --> 01:33:30,984
Lo Pan is dead and the evil spell's been lifted.

769
01:33:32,130 --> 01:33:35,588
Years ago I promised myself a long vacation.

770
01:33:35,667 --> 01:33:37,658
It is time to collect.

771
01:33:37,769 --> 01:33:41,068
Well, why don't you go on over to China?
Visit the motherland?

772
01:33:41,173 --> 01:33:45,769
Well, China's in the heart, Jack.
Wherever I go, she's with me.

773
01:33:48,247 --> 01:33:52,581
- So what are you gonna call it?
- I don't know.

774
01:33:52,651 --> 01:33:57,816
Maybe you can come over to my place later
and help me find a title?

775
01:33:59,892 --> 01:34:03,157
- Here, Jack. Nothin' or triple.
- Nothin' or double.

776
01:34:03,228 --> 01:34:05,992
Triple. You earned it.

777
01:34:06,298 --> 01:34:09,028
You're right, I did. Thanks, Wang.

778
01:34:12,237 --> 01:34:14,831
Well, last chance. I'm a rich man now.

779
01:34:14,907 --> 01:34:18,775
I can give up the open road,
sell my truck, settle down.

780
01:34:19,244 --> 01:34:21,838
Couldn't have that on my conscience.

781
01:34:21,914 --> 01:34:24,781
The only way it might work
is if you buy a bigger truck

782
01:34:24,850 --> 01:34:28,308
with a cozy little apartment
in back, just big enough for two.

783
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:33,824
That sounds pretty great. But sooner or later
I rub everybody the wrong way.

784
01:34:35,827 --> 01:34:38,091
Well, let me think about it.

785
01:34:41,833 --> 01:34:45,667
God, aren't you even
gonna kiss her goodbye?

786
01:34:49,441 --> 01:34:50,999
No.

787
01:34:53,211 --> 01:34:56,305
- See you around, Burton.
- Never can tell.

788
01:35:01,353 --> 01:35:03,446
Bye, Jack.

789
01:35:06,925 --> 01:35:10,292
We really shook the pillars of heaven,
didn't we, Wang?

790
01:35:10,362 --> 01:35:13,092
- No horseshit, Jack.
- No horseshit.

791
01:35:35,153 --> 01:35:38,782
You just listen to the Pork-Chop Express
and take his advice

792
01:35:38,890 --> 01:35:42,849
on a stormy night, when the lightning's
crashin', the thunder's roarin',

793
01:35:42,928 --> 01:35:46,728
and the rain's comin' down
in sheets thick as lead.

794
01:35:46,798 --> 01:35:49,767
Remember what old Jack Burton does
when the earth quakes

795
01:35:49,868 --> 01:35:54,771
and the poison arrows fall from the sky
and the pillars of heaven shake.

796
01:35:54,873 --> 01:35:59,742
Yeah, Jack Burton just looks that big old
storm right square in the eye and he says

797
01:35:59,811 --> 01:36:03,474
"Gimme your best shot, pal. I can take it."

798
01:39:30,622 --> 01:39:33,750
