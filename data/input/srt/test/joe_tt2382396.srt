00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,964
Hey, you old man. You look at me.

3
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:49,217
I got something to say to you.

4
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:52,428
Every time we land someplace new

5
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:55,682
you say it's going to be different, but it ain't.

6
00:01:00,353 --> 00:01:02,730
You mess up. A lot.

7
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:06,109
Then you leave a mess for me
and Momma and Dorothy to clean up.

8
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:09,153
And that ain't right. That's all I'm saying.

9
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:11,823
Hell, I do what I gotta do.

10
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:16,369
You do whatever the hell you want.
Whatever you can get away with.

11
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:21,791
You're just a selfish, old drunk.

12
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,212
Yeah, that's what you is.

13
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:32,093
This place is gonna be after us.

14
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:34,053
Hell, they'll be on you

15
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:37,056
and they're going to beat your ass.

16
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,185
And I'd hate to see you go down.

17
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:43,438
You know you're my daddy.

18
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,318
You know what you are, ain't you?

19
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:50,194
I'm talking at you.

20
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:01,205
What you done this time...

21
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,042
They'll beat your ass. Shit.

22
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,336
That's what they're gonna do.

23
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:10,298
You can count on it.

24
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:28,501
<i>As a matter of fact,
there was flood advisory in effect</i>

25
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:30,336
<i>at 5:45 this morning.</i>

26
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:33,297
<i>But just a few moments ago, as of 4:30,</i>

27
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:36,467
<i>that has been lifted
by the National Weather Service.</i>

28
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,429
<i>But was looking at some
of the Doppler radar estimates,</i>

29
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:42,974
<i>and it looked as if
close to three inches of rain</i>

30
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:45,268
<i>fell with a little thunder storm...</i>

31
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:52,734
- They got the grape?
- Yep.

32
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:55,278
They got grape, orange, lemon-lime,

33
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,238
fruit punch.

34
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:00,366
Got us back here in this monsoon.

35
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,202
Round them up, Junior!

36
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,246
Yo, it ain't even lunch time yet.

37
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:06,956
Round them up.

38
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,877
Let's pack up the gear, guys!
Let's get out of here. Let's go.

39
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:16,257
Can't get shit did out here in this rain.

40
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,635
I don't know why
he got us out here like this, Joe.

41
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:23,264
Let's go get them packs off.

42
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,891
One at a time. One at a time.

43
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,768
Hey, hey, hey, one at a time.

44
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:37,987
Why y'all movin' so slow?
You look like y'all goddamn turtles out here!

45
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:40,198
It's gettin' rain on us.

46
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:42,700
Let's go! Y'all come on, get out of here.

47
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:45,036
Come on, let's get out of here!

48
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:54,253
Damn, Joe.
When you gonna get you a new truck, Joe?

49
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:55,963
What's wrong with this one?

50
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:59,675
Shit. it raggedy.
You can't tell what wrong with it?

51
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,219
You don't know?

52
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:04,639
- Yeah, you gotta get another one.
- Yeah, man.

53
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:06,599
Let me get a cigarette.

54
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,566
Have to start taking this outta your pay.

55
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:22,907
All right then.

56
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:25,117
See you tomorrow if the sun comes up.

57
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:27,370
Holla at me in the mornin',
and let me know, now.

58
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,250
Put the jerseys in there.
Take your work gear off.

59
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:35,169
Leave all your work gear in here.

60
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:38,548
Come on y'all, leave the work gear.
Quit pussyfootin' around.

61
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,933
<i>And you can see the moisture
moving northward out of Mexico</i>

62
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:32,727
<i>and also out into the Gulf of Mexico.</i>

63
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,437
<i>Meeting up with this frontal system,</i>

64
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,523
<i>which has slowly been sagging southward.</i>

65
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,109
<i>As we look at temperatures
with the cloud cover,</i>

66
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,153
<i>not as hot as what we've been seeing.</i>

67
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,739
<i>But the cool down
isn't related to Canadian air.</i>

68
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:48,034
<i>Here's some Canadian air
over the northeastern part of the country.</i>

69
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:51,954
<i>Very high dew points, this represents
a whole lot of moisture available</i>

70
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:55,541
<i>to rise into those tall clouds
producing the heavy rains.</i>

71
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,960
<i>So the showers and thunderstorms
during tonight...</i>

72
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,499
- Morning, Junior.
- Morning, Joe.

73
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:38,042
You going to work this morning?

74
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,962
<i>Shit, Joe. If you gimme that raise
you promised me, I'll show up.</i>

75
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:42,797
What about Shorty? He get drunk last night?

76
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,757
<i>- Shorty almost got arrested last night.</i>
-What?

77
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,510
<i>- He</i> what?
<i>- Hell, yeah. Almost got arrested.</i>

78
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:50,429
<i>Hittin' that woman on her ass
like he retarded.</i>

79
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:53,933
All right, I'll be up at Coleman's
in 30 minutes. Y'all be ready.

80
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:56,060
<i>I'll be there, Joe. Bye-bye.</i>

81
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,646
Shorty, that was a rough night last night.

82
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:01,399
Almost didn't make it to work
this morning, boy.

83
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:02,984
You'd be surprised.

84
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:05,653
Drinkin' and tryin' to touch
this lady on her butt.

85
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:07,363
I couldn't help myself.

86
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:11,075
Hey, you gonna be all right.

87
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,703
You better watch yourself, nigga.

88
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:17,123
Here's Joe, y'all. Here's Joe.

89
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:19,333
- Let's load up, y'all.
- Come on, y'all help a brother out.

90
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:20,918
- Good morning, Joe.
- Good morning.

91
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:22,712
Shorty and Milton, y'all come with me.

92
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:24,046
I don't know why either.

93
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,007
That don't make no sense though,
you know?

94
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,258
You slow-pokin' today.

95
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,135
- Morning, John.
- Hello, Joe.

96
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,429
- You want some coffee?
- I can get it.

97
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:32,680
- It ain't cold, is it?
- No.

98
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,140
It was cold yesterday.

99
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:39,311
Let's see now. You're Milton, right?

100
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:40,688
I'm Shorty, he's Milton.

101
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,189
Hey, where's Sammy today?

102
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:45,192
Shit, Sammy gone fishin', Joe.
Hell, Sammy told me you fired him.

103
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:47,361
Hell, I've fired his ass three times already.

104
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:51,032
You tell Sammy I'm gonna fire him for good
if he don't start helping me out some.

105
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:53,617
- Y'all want some coffee?
- Yeah, sure, man.

106
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:56,037
- See that ball game last night?
- Yeah.

107
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,164
Those boys played one hell of a game.

108
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:00,374
- Who won though?
- We did, of course.

109
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,251
Shorty, you want some
of these wieners over here?

110
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,335
I'm good.

111
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:05,880
Shorty, if you had one like this,
you'd be a bad boy. God damn.

112
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,048
Whatever.

113
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:11,343
You got one of these right here,
itsy-bitsy, shriveled Slim Jim.

114
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:12,887
You actin' like
you ain't got nothin' to do today.

115
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,056
Y'all don't quit pussyfootin'
around me today...

116
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:17,141
Yeah, you gonna get some work
outta me, Junior.

117
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,976
All right, you're going to take
the east side over here.

118
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,478
- All right, over here?
- Take east side over there.

119
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:21,687
- You all right?
- Yes, sir.

120
00:09:21,771 --> 00:09:24,482
I want you to take the west side
over here today, all right?

121
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,233
Damn, why are you looking at me
like you're retarded?

122
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:27,902
Get that thing on and go with them.

123
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,361
Shorty, you all right today?

124
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:31,322
- Yeah, I'm good, man.
- Feeling pretty good?

125
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:34,116
You look like a goddamn Ghostbuster today.
You all right?

126
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,785
You gonna fight like one today?

127
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:38,662
- You gonna work like one?
<i>- I'll</i> look right, my man.

128
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,915
- I'm good.
- All right, don't trip on them.

129
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:42,208
Hell, yeah.

130
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,752
You better do some Ghostbuster moves
on me today, Shorty.

131
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:46,629
Yeah, bust them trees.

132
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,555
I got a snake!

133
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:03,349
I got a snake down here!

134
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:04,850
Better watch yourself, man.

135
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:08,229
I don't know. Look like a cottonmouth,
that mouth pretty big.

136
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:09,438
Damn.

137
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,357
Look at that.

138
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:13,984
I dunno how big he is.

139
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,242
Hey, Junior.

140
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:22,660
That's a big one now.

141
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,162
You could be known as the snake god.

142
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:29,917
I got one bigger anyway, Joe.

143
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:34,004
Joe, you got nuts of a bear, Joe.

144
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:37,216
That's what that woman told me last night.

145
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:40,219
She gotta need another snake,
I seen one today.

146
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:45,516
Yeah, you got a bunch of them.

147
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,142
What that fat woman said.

148
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,315
We got company.

149
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,696
Let me see that snake.

150
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,116
Ain't he a nice one?

151
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:05,661
See those fangs?

152
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,747
You get bit by those and you're gonna die.

153
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:09,999
You're gonna wanna die.

154
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,960
Y'all don't kill it.

155
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,545
He's my friend.

156
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:17,631
Damn, Joe. Don't toss it over by me!

157
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:19,675
Hey, get back to work, y'all.

158
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,010
The show is over with.

159
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:23,679
- I heard you screamin'.
- I wasn't screamin', I just move fast.

160
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,431
Whatever.

161
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:28,017
What are y'all doing?
Y'all cutting these trees?

162
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,395
We're killing trees.

163
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:33,439
What for?

164
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:36,066
Neidermeyer land.

165
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:39,778
The owner hires us to get rid of what's on it,

166
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:43,991
so they can come in
and put strong pines on it.

167
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,702
Nobody wants these trees,
these trees are weak.

168
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,038
They're not good for anything.

169
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:52,708
These boys will sit down
if I don't stay on their asses.

170
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:54,626
- Hey, mister?
- Yeah?

171
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,003
I got a question for you.

172
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,671
You see, me and my daddy
just got into town

173
00:13:57,755 --> 00:13:59,548
and I was wondering if you'd

174
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,550
give us a job. We're looking for work.

175
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:05,763
How old are you?

176
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:07,723
Fifteen.

177
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:12,644
Well you've got forty-five seconds
to tell me why I should hire you.

178
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,565
I baled hay before, I worked on a truck,
I picked tomatoes,

179
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,525
zucchini, cucumbers,

180
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,154
okra, squash...

181
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,782
All right, you're not afraid of work. Good.

182
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:26,033
What's your name?

183
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,201
Gary Jones.

184
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:28,452
I'm Joe.

185
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,829
I pay a day's pay for a day's work.

186
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:33,707
I pay on Fridays,
so you'll get a little something today,

187
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,085
but your first real payday is next Friday.

188
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:38,670
We start at about 6:00 in the morning,

189
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,131
quit at 1:00 or 2:00.

190
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:43,842
If we work till dinner or get rained out,
I pay for the whole day.

191
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,886
- Does that sound fair enough?
- Yes, sir.

192
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,763
- Follow this line of trees.
- Yes, sir.

193
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,848
Close to a half a mile back to my truck.

194
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:51,725
The juice hatchets are in the back.

195
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:54,269
You get yourself one, fill it up with poison,

196
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:56,355
then come on back
the same way you went out.

197
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:57,898
- Yes, sir.
- And don't get lost.

198
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,233
I won't.

199
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,359
Hey!

200
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,238
Don't you want to know how much
you're getting paid?

201
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,531
How you doing?

202
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:06,740
- Good.
- You doing all right?

203
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:08,283
- You ready to work today?
- Yes, sir.

204
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:09,743
- I'm Junior.
- Gary.

205
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:11,412
Hello, Gary. I'm gonna be over you today.

206
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:13,122
Raise your right hand.
You're gonna have to swear

207
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:14,456
that you're gonna work hard for me.

208
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,375
Not that hand, your right hand,
your other right.

209
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,919
Your right hand, there you go.

210
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,088
Put your hand up,
you gotta swear on somethin'.

211
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,299
Now you on the all-star team.

212
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:26,260
- You promise to work hard?
- Yes, sir.

213
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:29,805
All right, 'cause I don't know why
Joe chose you, you must be a good man.

214
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,890
First thing we do is fill these containers up.

215
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,767
We just gonna put it in there like that.

216
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:36,478
And once we get filled up real good,
then we on.

217
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:37,813
What's in the poison?

218
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,732
Shit. Shorty and his grandma
make it in their basement.

219
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:42,943
I don't know what's in it,
but we ain't gonna worry about that.

220
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,153
I know it work real good.

221
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:46,780
You thought that was easy
pumpin' that thing, didn't you?

222
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:48,615
I made it look easy 'cause I'm a man.

223
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:52,578
See, you a little boy, you got to figure it out.
See what I'm sayin'?

224
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:54,621
There you go. See how you figured that out?

225
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:57,958
When you become a man,
you gonna have everything figured out, too.

226
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,794
Be careful. Now, this stuff is real poisonous.

227
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:03,005
If it gets in your eyes, man, you out of there.

228
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,381
Just ask Junior.

229
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,717
Now here you go.

230
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,470
Which hand you use?

231
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:10,804
- Right hand.
- Okay.

232
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:14,766
Prime it up a little bit, and keep slinging it.

233
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,145
If you hit it hard enough,
you only have to hit it three or four times.

234
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,980
One... Two...

235
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,316
You got to get angry at the tree, man.

236
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:24,359
Get mad at it. Yeah, I like that.

237
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,403
Get mad at it. Keep on workin' it.

238
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,199
Work with it, work with it!

239
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:32,075
Yes, sir! Get it!

240
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,119
Keep on with it, youngster.

241
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:35,621
I like that, man.

242
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:38,165
Joe's been around.
He's been around a little bit, man.

243
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:41,251
He's got some things
up under his belt, man.

244
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:44,046
So I advise you, when you do go to Joe,

245
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,797
keep it real with Joe.

246
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:47,716
Don't lie to him about nothin',

247
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,260
and one thing
Joe is real particular about, man,

248
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:53,263
don't ever look down at the ground.
Look him in the face.

249
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:55,015
He likes to see a man's eyes.

250
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:57,726
You, one-on-one. That's how Joe is, man.

251
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,520
Where you from?

252
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,105
- Everywhere.
- Been around?

253
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:04,399
Being a little bitty boy
and you been everywhere?

254
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,985
Was your daddy in the military
or somethin'?

255
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,488
Yeah? All right. You got a family?

256
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,365
All right then.

257
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,867
You know we ain't gonna out you
no slack out here, don't you?

258
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:15,202
Just 'cause you young, now.

259
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:18,413
You know we ain't gonna out no slack.
Everybody pulls they own load, baby.

260
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:20,374
Once we get this filled up here,

261
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:23,335
we can kill us about 100 trees with this here.

262
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,587
Is killing trees against the law?

263
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:30,926
Well, the lumber company
can't cut them down unless they dead.

264
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,595
And so the lumber company
hire us to come in

265
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,347
and poison the trees.

266
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,141
So we can kill them
and they come in and die themselves.

267
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:40,102
Yeah, I been doing this
for a little minute now.

268
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:42,020
- Welcome to the program.
- Thanks.

269
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:43,397
It's hard work out here.

270
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,233
Well, the machete crew is the one
that comes through and clears it out.

271
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,693
Chop down at your angles.

272
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,278
Try to get as low as you can.

273
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:52,364
You got to clear the path
for your teammates.

274
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:54,825
Without you, none of this is gonna happen.

275
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,870
And just keep hammering at it.
Nothing stopping you.

276
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:02,040
Yeah, you start out, you'll probably
be the Waterman for a little while.

277
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,501
It's gonna look like
you're doing everything for everyone,

278
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:07,879
bringing them water.
At the end, you'll become a machete vet.

279
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:09,881
Samurai kings, right here.

280
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,262
Welcome to the crew, you the youngest.
Gotta crawl before you walk.

281
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,972
You got a lot of energy there.

282
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:19,850
There you go.

283
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:23,478
Samurai gods.

284
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,608
Crew! When y'all get through
with this side over here,

285
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,109
we're going to the west side.

286
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,485
All right.

287
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,780
Hey, Gary! You're getting too far ahead.

288
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:36,199
Come on back here
and help these fellas out.

289
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,300
You know what? You, you, and you.

290
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,218
Y'all did a good job today.

291
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:59,514
Why don't y'all go ahead and get paid,
and I'll see y'all Monday. All right?

292
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:00,932
Little.

293
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:02,934
- Alan.
- Thank you, sir.

294
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,312
And Gary, right?

295
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:06,647
Yes, sir.

296
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,566
Gary, Gary, Gary-

297
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,570
Come back Monday.

298
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,990
Bring your daddy if he wants to work.

299
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,825
Yes, sir. I will.

300
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,912
We'll be there. Thanks.

301
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:57,322
Momma!

302
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:59,658
Hey, Momma. Guess what?

303
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:03,537
I got us jobs today.

304
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,540
I got a job today.

305
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,166
Good for you, babies.

306
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,509
Hey, Dorothy!

307
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,470
- Dorothy, guess what?
- He got one.

308
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:22,139
That's good.

309
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:35,318
<i>Jew.</i>

310
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,279
Sorry.

311
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,294
Got that asshole put away?

312
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,005
Yes, Joe. He's in the back.

313
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:57,591
That asshole bites me again...

314
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:00,218
Well, he's got the devil in him.

315
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,511
Fuck that.

316
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,013
Come on, baby.

317
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:12,647
Look at that.

318
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:20,947
Mexican game show.
That's what I'm talking about.

319
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:22,949
Can I fix you somethin', baby?

320
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,409
Coke. Ice.

321
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:37,714
Here you go, sweetie.

322
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,474
So what you got the blues over, Joe?

323
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:50,060
I'm not so bad.

324
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:53,230
Want one of my girls?

325
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:57,692
You want two of my girls?

326
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:59,486
Not today.

327
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:01,404
Today is a special day.

328
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:03,573
It is?

329
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,660
I only want your company, Merle.

330
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,000
- Why, thank you.
- Come here.

331
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,136
Put that asshole away!

332
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,598
Lacy! Put the dog in the back.

333
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,268
Come on. I got it.

334
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:32,936
Come on.

335
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:38,441
You don't need that thing
to take care of you.

336
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:42,821
Where are you going, Joe?

337
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:52,330
Girl, get your ass off the floor.

338
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,541
Quit being stupid.

339
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,939
You see who that was?

340
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:19,190
Yes.

341
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:22,068
What is that World War I or ll?
Where'd you get that hat?

342
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:23,528
- WW ll.
- Right.

343
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:25,572
Got it down there at the Army-Navy.

344
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:28,408
I've been making some money
over at Henry's house, throwing the dice.

345
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:31,536
Yeah, I know. I was gonna go
over there later and clean him out.

346
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,038
Maybe I'll see you there.

347
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:35,957
I've been doing pretty good
taking the money from them old ladies

348
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,126
that he and old Blind George hang outwith.

349
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,838
I take about 60 or 70% of my winnings

350
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:43,965
and donate it to diabetes research.

351
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:47,177
But then I take the rest of it

352
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,220
and buy war paraphernalia.

353
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:51,806
One of these days,
I'm gonna be a regular GI Joe.

354
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,351
Fistful of dollars!

355
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,269
Something like that.

356
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,534
Henry!

357
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:12,827
In here, Joe!

358
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:14,579
You told me you knew how to do this.

359
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:16,164
Hey, Joe.

360
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,792
How you been doin'?
What are you up to today?

361
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:21,044
- Who's that?
- Henry's just making a damn mess.

362
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,588
- What are you tryin' to do, Henry?
- I don't know.

363
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:25,548
- He's making a damn mess.
- I don't have experience

364
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:26,967
to cut this deer, you know?

365
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,970
It's big one, you know,
but tryin' to out it in roasts, you know, but...

366
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:31,972
Yeah, well, I don't think
I would cut it into a roast.

367
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:33,098
No.

368
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:36,393
You can do anyway you want to,
but if it was mine, I'd cut it into steaks.

369
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,895
Come over here
and show him how to do it, honey.

370
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:42,440
Henry, you can sit down there and tell
me a joke or sing a song or something.

371
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:44,901
Well, shit. You might as well
just let Blind George cut it up.

372
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:46,152
I'm gonna sit down.

373
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:48,279
I mean, George could cut it up.

374
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:50,323
If you gave him enough time,
couldn't you, George?

375
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,909
I reckon I can do better
than they are doing it.

376
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:54,452
No.

377
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:57,330
All right.
I'll show you how to make the steaks.

378
00:24:57,414 --> 00:25:00,375
That'll be good, baby. I love backstrap.

379
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,752
Hold on here. That's good, that's enough.

380
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:14,764
Now look what happened to the poor thing.

381
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:17,517
All that blood on the floor, God.

382
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,525
Where'd you get this deer?

383
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:29,154
It was hung up on the fence,
over at Mr. Lee's.

384
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:32,949
And Henry and I was coming back
from the IHOP

385
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:36,327
and I took out my .38
and shot her in the head.

386
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:41,041
Honey, you use that knife
just like an artist's brush.

387
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:43,960
I mean, you know what you're doing, Joe.

388
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,504
Man, look at that.

389
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:48,214
Man...

390
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:49,716
There's some good stuff here.

391
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,052
- That is some good stuff.
- Now, look here.

392
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,139
Man, that is pretty.

393
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,308
Yes, wonderful.

394
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:02,145
That's how you do it. Butterfly steak.

395
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:04,856
- Wonderful.
- You see how I did that?

396
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:07,567
Now do it here, here, and here.

397
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,402
Y'all can cut up the rest of it.

398
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:12,489
So, when are you gonna have
another crap game?

399
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:14,991
Tonight. You wanna come by?

400
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:16,826
- What time?
-10:00.

401
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:18,745
We're making a birthday cake.

402
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:22,082
We? Joe, you know who's gonna make
the birthday cake.

403
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:24,417
I'm gonna make a birthday cake tonight.

404
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:25,752
Right, Stacy?

405
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:27,921
I love you, Henry, but you know what?

406
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:30,090
I am the fucking birthday girl here,

407
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:32,425
and I have to make my own damn cake?

408
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:33,843
That's not my problem.

409
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:40,809
Sure, I'll make me a birthday cake,
no problem.

410
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:42,644
I gotta go uptown. Y'all need anything?

411
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:44,979
I think I need some freezer paper.

412
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:47,607
Bring me back some damn freezer paper,

413
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:49,984
and another pack of cigarettes.

414
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:52,529
- Good stuff.
- We love you, baby.

415
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:56,991
That backstrap, well,
that's the part that basically, I only eat...

416
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:01,079
Hello, Joe.

417
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:09,379
Hold on, buddy.

418
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:22,976
Joe, you all right?

419
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:24,978
What happened?

420
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:34,696
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen.

421
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:36,072
Ladies and gentlemen.

422
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:12,901
Can we go now?

423
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:15,236
What are you doing?

424
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:17,280
Where you gonna go?

425
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:21,409
We gonna go into town and get some food.
Come on.

426
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:24,871
Get something to eat with what?
We ain't got hardly nothing here.

427
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:27,874
Well, it ain't much, but it's something.
Come on.

428
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,376
I ain't getting up.

429
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:34,672
- Are you drunk?
- I ain't drunk.

430
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,593
- I know you drunk.
-No, I ain't drunk.

431
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:40,637
You like, "I ain't drunk..."

432
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,431
I didn't take my medicine today, boy.

433
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:45,558
- I didn't take my medicine.
-"I'm just tired."

434
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:48,519
- I didn't take my medicine.
-"I'm just tired."

435
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,980
"I ain't drunk."

436
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:53,316
Come on, get up.

437
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:55,693
Come on.

438
00:28:57,195 --> 00:28:58,529
Come on, get up.

439
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:00,907
Come on, please.

440
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,409
You'll be all right, come on. I'll help you up.

441
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:05,119
You can make it.

442
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,877
Yeah, no, you know what...

443
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:16,965
I'm gonna sit right here, in the dirt.

444
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:19,634
I'm gonna teach you
a little about breakdancing.

445
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:21,678
You ever seen breakdancing before?

446
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:23,930
You know what popping,
you know what locking is?

447
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,473
Do you, bud?

448
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:27,100
Take this hand right here,

449
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:30,687
pretend it's going over a wave
like you're out there in the ocean.

450
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:34,065
You floating. Come on, son.
You floating out there in the ocean.

451
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:37,777
Tidal wave coming across
the bottom to the other side.

452
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:39,612
Here we go. Yeah.

453
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:41,197
We're waving now.

454
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:43,491
Bring it back up. Here comes the big one!

455
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:46,744
Yeah! There it is.

456
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:48,121
Hey! Hey!

457
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:50,957
Now, now, that shit ain't funny, right there.

458
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:52,917
That shit ain't funny at all.

459
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:54,711
I'll come get it now.

460
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:57,463
- You want it? You want it?
- Yeah.

461
00:29:57,547 --> 00:30:00,550
I'm not through with my lesson,
life's lesson.

462
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,302
You only learned about waving.

463
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:03,886
Popping, you ever seen popping?

464
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,471
Pop! That's popping.

465
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:07,140
You know what locking is?

466
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:09,726
I really can't do a whole lot of locking
unless I'm...

467
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,644
Unless I'm standing, and...

468
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:15,857
- Well, stand up, come on.
- I don't see myself doing much of that

469
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,276
in the near future there, son.

470
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:20,570
I know you're drunk
because you're about to spill it.

471
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:23,239
Why would I spill it? I need a pillow.

472
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:27,910
There we go. Yeah.

473
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:31,080
One, two...

474
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:43,384
Hey, mister!

475
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:47,263
Hey, mister.

476
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:49,974
Can you give me a ride?

477
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:52,685
Say it again?

478
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:57,023
Me and my daddy was wondering
if you could give us a ride back into town.

479
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:58,358
He ain't feeling too good.

480
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,111
Shit, yeah.

481
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:04,781
Yeah, I'll give you boys a ride.

482
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,866
Come on, where's your daddy at?

483
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:09,869
He's back that a way.

484
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:13,956
What did you chunk that gun
off the bridge for?

485
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:18,961
I just threw it.

486
00:31:20,338 --> 00:31:21,631
You know?

487
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:26,386
Weapons tend to make men
do violent things.

488
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,055
Yeah.

489
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:30,431
Guns,

490
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:33,059
knives,

491
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:36,938
cannonballs, little sticks of dynamite.

492
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:40,983
Hell, even automobiles.

493
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:48,574
Hey, come here.

494
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:51,661
Look at my face.

495
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:54,163
You see that?

496
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:56,499
I see it.

497
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:59,419
I went through a windshield
at 4:00 one morning,

498
00:31:59,502 --> 00:32:01,504
and I don't give a fuck.

499
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:03,131
Now,

500
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,343
folks looking for trouble
tend to find more than they're after.

501
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:11,097
And I'll kill his fucking ass
if he ever slaps me again,

502
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,432
you understand me?

503
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:14,767
Who you talking about?

504
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:16,436
If he ever

505
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,688
slaps

506
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,356
me

507
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:23,276
again.

508
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:38,207
You got any sisters?

509
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,042
What?

510
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,003
Sisters.

511
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:44,964
You got any sisters?

512
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:47,884
Is she pretty?

513
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:52,805
Mister, don't you talk about my sister.

514
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:55,975
Well, shit.

515
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:59,479
You're a tough little son of a bitch,
ain't you?

516
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:01,814
Who the fuck you talking to?

517
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:05,568
I'm talking to you, mister.
Don't you disrespect my family.

518
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:08,738
You know what I think?

519
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:11,407
I think I'm gonna say
whatever the fuck I wanna say.

520
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:14,869
You get the hell off me, mister.
I ain't done nothing to you.

521
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:20,333
I don't think I'm gonna give you
that ride no more.

522
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:25,505
I think I'm gonna take you,
and I'm gonna throw you off that bridge.

523
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:27,423
See how you like that.

524
00:33:31,636 --> 00:33:33,179
Look at me, son.

525
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:34,514
Look at my face.

526
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:36,891
I went through a windshield
at 4:00 one morning,

527
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:38,643
and I don't give a fuck.

528
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:49,111
Look at me, you son of a bitch!

529
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:52,031
You stupid motherfucker!
You think I'm a kid?

530
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:53,783
You think I'm a goddamn kid?

531
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:56,911
I'll beat your ass,
and now you know it's true.

532
00:35:28,002 --> 00:35:29,128
Quiet!

533
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:39,513
Joe?

534
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:46,937
<i>Jew.</i>

535
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:50,399
- Is he gonna bite me?
- God damn it, would you shut up!

536
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:53,527
Shut up and get back up under there,
and let these ladies alone!

537
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:54,612
Get!

538
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:56,489
Y'all come on.

539
00:35:57,365 --> 00:35:58,866
Dog won't bite.

540
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:06,624
God, that dog's crazy.
What if you hadn't been here?

541
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:09,960
If I hadn't been here, you wouldn't have
no business in my goddamn yard.

542
00:36:10,044 --> 00:36:11,545
Damn, what's happened to you?

543
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:14,715
Hang on a minute.

544
00:36:18,094 --> 00:36:19,261
Fuck“.

545
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,057
Place is a mess, Joe.

546
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,267
I wasn't expecting company.

547
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:30,231
Well, we was just driving around,
looking for something to do.

548
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:33,943
Didn't know if you'd be home or not.

549
00:36:57,967 --> 00:36:59,135
Hey...

550
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:00,928
Hey...

551
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:11,647
Are you all right?

552
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:15,234
I gotta quit smoking.

553
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:19,405
What the hell happened to you?

554
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:24,535
I slapped some asshole
the other night at the bar.

555
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:26,162
He come back and shot me.

556
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:27,830
Jesus,Joe.

557
00:37:29,123 --> 00:37:31,125
What, you and Willie-Russell
be running around

558
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:32,960
acting like kids again?

559
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:36,756
It's ridiculous. I don't even remember
what set you off in the first place.

560
00:37:40,551 --> 00:37:42,011
Neither do I.

561
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:45,931
So what was it you wanted to talk about?

562
00:37:46,015 --> 00:37:47,266
You need some money?

563
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,811
No, nothing like that.

564
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:59,320
You know that guy, Frank? The guy?

565
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:04,450
He's back in town,
and I don't wanna stay at my momma's.

566
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:06,327
Well, I thought she ran him off.

567
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,329
She did. Twice.

568
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:11,081
But he called the other night, and...

569
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:16,170
Came back begging for forgiveness.

570
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:20,883
She said he could stay
as long as he promised to leave me alone.

571
00:38:21,884 --> 00:38:23,469
And he promised.

572
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:26,055
Just like he always does.

573
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:27,473
But...

574
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:36,023
Still got your job? Up at the cleaners?

575
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:42,238
Good.

576
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:44,114
I wouldn't even hardly be here.

577
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,410
I could take care of you.

578
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:51,080
If you let me.

579
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:55,501
I promise, I won't even tell her where I'm at.

580
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:57,461
You won't have to. She'll know.

581
00:38:57,545 --> 00:39:00,631
She already called here 40 times
looking for you.

582
00:39:06,095 --> 00:39:08,764
You can stay with me if you need to.

583
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:12,017
I can't promise you much,

584
00:39:12,643 --> 00:39:14,812
but I'll try to be nice.

585
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:19,650
One, two, three, six, eleven.

586
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:22,111
Get off yo ass,
you ain't nothing but a number!

587
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:24,113
Let's go, y'all.

588
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:27,324
So, Sammy. Where you been?
I haven't seen you around.

589
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:29,785
You going to those night school classes
or something?

590
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:31,036
Not yet.

591
00:39:31,537 --> 00:39:33,747
Been doing a little work on the side,

592
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:36,625
trying to make a little extra cash.
Get my shit together.

593
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:38,878
- You know what I mean?
- I know what you mean.

594
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:41,964
I know. We're just not good enough
for you anymore, are we Sammy?

595
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,716
I didn't say that.

596
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,427
Who these white folks you got working?

597
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:49,221
Yeah, I'm not sure.

598
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:51,640
They need work and I need help.

599
00:39:51,724 --> 00:39:54,059
Young, old, black, white, red, yellow...

600
00:39:54,143 --> 00:39:56,270
I really don't give a shit, Sammy.

601
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:57,521
Water!

602
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,398
Drink of fucking water.

603
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:30,763
That's my water there.
Why you drinking my water?

604
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:33,515
Thirsty, that's why.

605
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,601
- Thirsty and hot.
- Yeah, but that got them water flavor.

606
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:39,480
That's my personal water.
Why you drinking my water up like that?

607
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:42,358
We gonna have a problem outta you all day?

608
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:48,864
If I catch you with my water again,
you gonna have a problem outta me.

609
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:51,283
<i>Joe sent you down here with me?</i>

610
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:53,994
- Yeah.
- Let me help you with that pack.

611
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,538
What the hell you use this thing for?

612
00:40:56,622 --> 00:40:59,208
I'll show you how to walk through it.

613
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:02,169
God damn. Thing's heavy.

614
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:05,631
You use this lever right here
to pump out the poison.

615
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,676
Take this hatchet and hit into the tree.

616
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:10,636
Let's see what you got.

617
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,431
Okay, right here.

618
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,810
- Goddamn thing is leaking all over.
-It happens sometimes.

619
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:20,229
Let's get to work. Let see it, right here.

620
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,107
This is bullshit, right here.

621
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,276
Come on, man. Swing it.

622
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:28,904
You gotta swing harder than that.

623
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:31,240
Come on, man. Get into it.

624
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:33,826
Man, this is some stupid-ass shit, man.

625
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:36,412
That's how he can't eat chocolate now.

626
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:38,831
Y'all niggas is...

627
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:41,166
Y'all niggas is near, I ain't hungry no more.

628
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,003
Ain't gonna tell you what
I was dreaming about, what I had, though...

629
00:41:44,086 --> 00:41:45,170
I don't wanna know, Junior.

630
00:41:45,254 --> 00:41:48,173
I don't wanna know about your king cobra,
okay. Or whatever you call it.

631
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:50,467
Go-Go-Gadget Tongue, that's what he got.

632
00:41:51,093 --> 00:41:52,928
You ain't never notice that
about your girl, man?

633
00:41:53,012 --> 00:41:55,014
One of her breasts
is bigger than the other one, man.

634
00:41:55,097 --> 00:41:56,181
- Wait a minute.
- One sits up here,

635
00:41:56,265 --> 00:41:58,225
and the other one sits down there.

636
00:41:58,434 --> 00:42:00,644
No comment. No comment, nigga.

637
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:03,689
You nasty...

638
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:06,358
- Don't go head first.
- I don't go...

639
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:09,611
Shorty don't want to tell us the truth
about them drips he had, man,

640
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:11,113
about that penicillin shot, man.

641
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:13,657
That's a lie. That's a damn lie.
That's a damn lie.

642
00:42:16,827 --> 00:42:18,746
Sure is a beautiful day out here, ain't it?

643
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:19,913
It's all right.

644
00:42:19,997 --> 00:42:23,709
You sitting out here like an angel,
sitting out here under this pretty sun.

645
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,252
Maybe I am an angel.

646
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:28,297
Yeah, but you got to go to work on my job.
You ain't on my job working.

647
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,381
Why you not working today?

648
00:42:29,465 --> 00:42:31,258
What, you just come up here
to give me a hard time?

649
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:32,843
Well, I been looking at you all goddamn clay,

650
00:42:32,926 --> 00:42:34,595
and I see you up here
smoking a goddamn cigarette,

651
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:37,806
watching this, goddamn... Well,
I think you a pretty son of a bitch out here.

652
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,349
And we got to come out here to work.

653
00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:41,060
I don't know why you ain't trying to work.

654
00:42:41,143 --> 00:42:43,062
I done all the work I'm gonna do today.

655
00:42:43,145 --> 00:42:44,980
Hell, you ain't did shit, all goddamn clay.

656
00:42:45,064 --> 00:42:46,565
You ain't done a motherfucking thing.

657
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:49,151
And who are you to tell me
I ain't done nothing at all today?

658
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:50,694
As long as you out here, I'm your boss.

659
00:42:50,778 --> 00:42:54,239
You ain't my boss, and obviously you can't
even watch what people are doing.

660
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:57,326
'Cause if you saw anything,
you'd know I've been working all day.

661
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,912
I've been working all damn day. All day.

662
00:42:59,995 --> 00:43:02,915
No, you been dragging your ass
all goddamn day.

663
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:04,500
Who's trying to argue with who?

664
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:07,252
You ain't did shit all goddamn...
I'm trying to get you to working.

665
00:43:07,336 --> 00:43:10,005
- Man, you got about six other people!
- You ain't did shit all goddamn day!

666
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:11,590
I told you to goddamn get to working!

667
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:13,967
You gotta get your ass outta
my motherfucking job!

668
00:43:14,051 --> 00:43:16,470
Go tell Joe right now! Go tell him!

669
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:19,389
Joe goddamn gonna have to get rid of you
or do something different.

670
00:43:19,473 --> 00:43:20,808
Something gonna change today.

671
00:43:20,891 --> 00:43:23,519
'Cause tomorrow we ain't gonna
have this bullshit.

672
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:25,604
- Are you done?
- Yeah, I'm done with this bullshit...

673
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:27,106
Good, I'm glad you're done!

674
00:43:27,189 --> 00:43:29,525
I'm glad you're done. Stay done.

675
00:43:31,527 --> 00:43:34,738
Look like you got a yeast infection
on your goddamn face!

676
00:43:34,822 --> 00:43:36,240
You country motherfucker.

677
00:43:55,217 --> 00:43:59,555
- Can you make it out of there?
- Yeah. I'll make it, I guess.

678
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:01,765
Goddamn ass hurts.

679
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:05,144
Come here, son.

680
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:07,271
Help me get over this tailgate.

681
00:44:07,354 --> 00:44:09,481
Joe, what time you need us back
in the morning?

682
00:44:09,565 --> 00:44:11,733
I don't need you back in the morning.

683
00:44:11,817 --> 00:44:13,819
What do you mean, you don't need us back?

684
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:16,071
We got the job done, didn't we?

685
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:18,907
That's yours there, son.

686
00:44:23,996 --> 00:44:26,748
We got the job done.
Gary said we got the job.

687
00:44:26,832 --> 00:44:28,500
Joe, I'll do anything you want.

688
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:30,502
Clear brush, anytime, anywhere.

689
00:44:30,586 --> 00:44:31,879
I can do it.

690
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:34,214
Joe, I'd sure like to work some more.

691
00:44:34,298 --> 00:44:35,674
Yeah, maybe later.

692
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:37,384
I'll let you know.

693
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:45,475
I don't know what you did
that made that man mad, or something.

694
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:46,602
You hear me?

695
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:57,279
What the hell are you looking at?

696
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:12,794
<i>Just another day.</i>

697
00:45:15,297 --> 00:45:17,049
It ain't his fault.

698
00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:19,801
He loves us, it's just...

699
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:24,890
He just goes through hard times.

700
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:40,614
Well, I ain't gonna watch him sit there
and hit you like he hits me. You hear me?

701
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:42,074
Okay, Momma?

702
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:47,871
You ain't supposed to do that to no one.

703
00:45:54,503 --> 00:45:56,546
<i>You stay with your family.</i>

704
00:45:59,341 --> 00:46:01,468
That's what you need to do.

705
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:04,471
You need to stay with your family.

706
00:46:08,517 --> 00:46:10,519
Your family's all you got.

707
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:26,535
What was that?

708
00:46:28,287 --> 00:46:29,830
I don't know.

709
00:46:30,706 --> 00:46:32,624
Didn't hear no car drive up.

710
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:36,628
Probably ain't nobody.
Ain't nobody with any sense out in this.

711
00:46:38,714 --> 00:46:40,340
Can't taste that.

712
00:46:44,928 --> 00:46:46,888
We gonna go out tonight?

713
00:46:48,515 --> 00:46:49,891
Not really.

714
00:46:52,936 --> 00:46:54,688
Where you wanna go?

715
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:01,069
I don't know.

716
00:47:02,321 --> 00:47:05,699
I was just wondering
if we were gonna do something.

717
00:47:08,577 --> 00:47:10,704
I think you work too much.

718
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,459
We should get out.

719
00:47:15,751 --> 00:47:17,419
Do something fun.

720
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:20,088
I hadn't planned on it...

721
00:47:21,173 --> 00:47:23,091
Not unless you want to.

722
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:30,265
We don't have to.

723
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:38,690
There's someone out there.

724
00:47:38,774 --> 00:47:40,275
No. No, wait.

725
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:43,445
Hold this.

726
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:55,874
Hey, Joe. Can you put that dog up?

727
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:58,418
Hell. I know who it is.

728
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:03,632
<i>Boy, you're soaking-ass wet.</i>

729
00:48:03,757 --> 00:48:06,176
What'd you plan to do, stand there all night?

730
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,096
He should get out of them wet clothes.
He'll get sick.

731
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:10,555
No, I'm all right. I just...

732
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:12,933
I just wanted to come by and talk to you
about working some more.

733
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:15,727
Work? Don't you see
what it's doing out there?

734
00:48:16,812 --> 00:48:18,146
Yes, sir.

735
00:48:18,313 --> 00:48:19,731
Hey, where's my drink at?

736
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:22,401
You got any trousers he can wear?
What size waist you got?

737
00:48:22,484 --> 00:48:25,570
Well, I think I have some cool pants
he can wear.

738
00:48:27,948 --> 00:48:30,575
I bet nobody come messing around here
with that dog out there.

739
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:31,993
Well, that's why I got the dog.

740
00:48:32,077 --> 00:48:34,413
Dog won't bother anybody
just walking down the road.

741
00:48:34,496 --> 00:48:37,040
Road ain't Dog's. Dog knows what's Dog's.

742
00:48:37,124 --> 00:48:40,001
You could've just walked on off,
Dog wouldn't have done anything.

743
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:42,295
All right. Here, try these on.

744
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:44,423
<i>L</i> think they'll fit you.

745
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:46,341
Bathroom's this way.

746
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:49,761
Dog is a good dog.

747
00:48:49,845 --> 00:48:52,889
Yeah, that dog scared
the hell out of me though.

748
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,184
He's all beat up.

749
00:48:58,186 --> 00:49:00,147
His daddy. I saw him do it.

750
00:49:02,732 --> 00:49:04,025
You what?

751
00:49:05,068 --> 00:49:09,489
What, you just sat there and watched it?
Or what?

752
00:49:10,282 --> 00:49:11,908
He's a big kid...

753
00:49:15,203 --> 00:49:18,373
I can't get my hands dirty
in every little thing.

754
00:49:18,582 --> 00:49:20,083
You know how I get.

755
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:21,960
You're a grown man, Joe.

756
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:23,712
What's that supposed to mean?

757
00:49:24,254 --> 00:49:26,673
It can mean whatever you want it to mean.

758
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,384
Don't fool yourself too much about me.

759
00:49:34,723 --> 00:49:36,683
Hey, there you go.

760
00:49:36,892 --> 00:49:38,810
You look like a million bucks.

761
00:49:38,894 --> 00:49:40,395
You feel better now?

762
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:43,857
I feel like a hundred bucks.

763
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:48,278
I come by 'cause I wanted to talk to you
about my job.

764
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:52,741
I wanna work and I need a job.

765
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:55,702
My daddy don't care
if he gots a job, but I do.

766
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:58,455
You'd work in this rain, wouldn't you?

767
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:01,750
If you need me to.

768
00:50:05,462 --> 00:50:08,340
Let me slip my shoes on,
and I'll run you back home.

769
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:17,390
Hey, we'll be there in just a second, okay?

770
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:20,894
Hey...

771
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:24,689
You know you don't have to take no
shit from nobody, right?

772
00:50:25,941 --> 00:50:27,526
You know that, right?

773
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:29,444
Yes, ma'am.

774
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:31,738
Good.

775
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:34,241
Now, let's go.

776
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:38,703
- How you been, Chris?
- Good, how about you?

777
00:50:38,787 --> 00:50:41,081
Yeah, all right.
You still doing the mixed martial arts?

778
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:42,207
Yes, sir.

779
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:44,501
What are you doing out in the rain, Joe?

780
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:49,297
I need two pounds of ham
and a pound of Swiss cheese sliced up.

781
00:50:49,381 --> 00:50:52,050
All right. Come on, you get the cheese,
and I'll get the ham.

782
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:56,680
Yes, sir. Looks like every time
I get a little ahead, it starts in raining again.

783
00:51:02,894 --> 00:51:04,312
Here you go.

784
00:51:05,981 --> 00:51:07,816
It's not much. Now, look here.

785
00:51:08,692 --> 00:51:12,612
When it dries up, you come down here
early in the morning before light,

786
00:51:12,696 --> 00:51:14,573
and I'll pick you up and take you to work.

787
00:51:14,656 --> 00:51:17,075
We've got plenty to do
when the weather gets right.

788
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:18,660
You got a clock?

789
00:51:19,035 --> 00:51:20,412
No, you wouldn't. All right.

790
00:51:20,495 --> 00:51:22,747
I'll find you a wind-up clock or something.

791
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:24,374
All right, then.

792
00:51:24,541 --> 00:51:25,584
Thank you, sir.

793
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:27,794
You don't need to call me sir all the time.

794
00:51:27,877 --> 00:51:30,171
I'm your friend. You understand?

795
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:33,633
All right. Hey, where's his ham?

796
00:51:33,717 --> 00:51:35,969
- Hang on. We're coming.
- All right.

797
00:52:09,044 --> 00:52:11,171
What are you thinking, Joe?

798
00:52:14,257 --> 00:52:15,508
Nothing.

799
00:52:17,886 --> 00:52:20,597
There's nothing I can do and I hate it.

800
00:52:22,432 --> 00:52:23,975
That's not true.

801
00:52:25,977 --> 00:52:27,479
Yeah, it is.

802
00:52:31,274 --> 00:52:33,902
<i>You look at me like I can make a move.</i>

803
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:38,782
<i>What are you thinking when you look at me
like that? Don't you care?</i>

804
00:52:40,408 --> 00:52:42,285
<i>I don't know who I am,</i>

805
00:52:45,288 --> 00:52:49,709
<i>but I know what keeps me alive is restraint.</i>

806
00:52:51,795 --> 00:52:53,588
<i>Keeps me out of jail.</i>

807
00:52:54,923 --> 00:52:57,092
<i>Keeps me from hurting people.</i>

808
00:53:04,808 --> 00:53:05,934
Hey.

809
00:53:07,769 --> 00:53:11,481
<i>A mark of some fucked-up faith
that there's a reason.</i>

810
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,525
Thank you.

811
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:15,610
<i>A reason for all of this.</i>

812
00:53:16,778 --> 00:53:20,198
<i>A reason in most moments
I shouldn't do what I wanna do.</i>

813
00:53:23,284 --> 00:53:25,120
<i>I do as I'm told.</i>

814
00:53:25,912 --> 00:53:28,206
Come on, let's load up. Let's get outta here.

815
00:53:28,873 --> 00:53:32,085
<i>These men who bust their asses
work like dogs.</i>

816
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:37,048
<i>And I believe in them,
but every day they hurt.</i>

817
00:53:39,134 --> 00:53:41,469
<i>They get old, they peel back...</i>

818
00:53:43,138 --> 00:53:45,306
Lewis. Junior.

819
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:46,933
<i>There's no frontier anymore.</i>

820
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:48,226
Sammy.

821
00:53:48,476 --> 00:53:49,602
Alan.

822
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:51,479
Clark.

823
00:53:52,814 --> 00:53:53,940
Gary.

824
00:53:55,024 --> 00:53:56,818
<i>And I watch that boy.</i>

825
00:53:58,403 --> 00:53:59,988
<i>I see someone who's...</i>

826
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:02,073
<i>Who's nothing like me, but...</i>

827
00:54:02,157 --> 00:54:04,743
<i>He's a child, folks left behind.</i>

828
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:08,204
<i>And he's on the fence,</i>

829
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:11,416
<i>balanced right there.</i>

830
00:54:15,628 --> 00:54:17,255
What do you want?

831
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:24,596
<i>What is it you want?</i>

832
00:54:26,848 --> 00:54:27,932
<i>Nothing.</i>

833
00:54:31,394 --> 00:54:33,563
<i>Just tell me what I can do.</i>

834
00:54:37,609 --> 00:54:38,985
<i>I like you.</i>

835
00:54:42,572 --> 00:54:45,074
<i>I like you, too,
but what's the point in any of it?</i>

836
00:54:51,581 --> 00:54:53,416
<i>Fuck to this day.</i>

837
00:54:54,542 --> 00:54:56,795
<i>I mean, fuck to this day.</i>

838
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:05,386
<i>It's all just gonna boil up
and wash us away...</i>

839
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:14,229
<i>Maybe you'll still be here.</i>

840
00:55:19,067 --> 00:55:20,443
<i>Maybe you won't.</i>

841
00:55:31,037 --> 00:55:33,790
Damn, Joe. Why you keep loading
all these fools in this little truck?

842
00:55:33,873 --> 00:55:35,208
Good to have you with us again, Sammy.

843
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:37,293
It drop down any lower,
we gonna have to get out and push,

844
00:55:37,377 --> 00:55:38,378
and I ain't pushing shit.

845
00:55:38,461 --> 00:55:40,672
Joe, I thought they had y'all
on a new truck, Joe.

846
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:42,423
I ain't getting no new truck.

847
00:55:42,507 --> 00:55:43,800
You need one.

848
00:55:43,883 --> 00:55:45,176
No, I don't.

849
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:47,637
Joe, if you get a new truck,
how much you want for this old one?

850
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,347
You mean this old piece of junk?

851
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:52,350
Smells like somebody died up in there.
It's nasty.

852
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:55,019
I don't mind the smell. I like it.
Smells good to me.

853
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,313
Yeah, but this thing,

854
00:55:58,439 --> 00:56:01,150
I spend as much time working on it
as I do driving it.

855
00:56:01,693 --> 00:56:04,195
Of course, there ain't nothing major
wrong with it.

856
00:56:04,279 --> 00:56:07,031
It's just little shit, you know.
It needs some brakes.

857
00:56:07,115 --> 00:56:08,449
It needs...

858
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:12,120
Joe. Come on.

859
00:56:12,912 --> 00:56:14,914
I'll buy it from you, I'll work my butt off.

860
00:56:14,998 --> 00:56:17,333
I love the truck,
you have to give it to me now.

861
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:19,085
Well, I mean, it's...

862
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:20,837
It's got a lot of miles on it.

863
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,047
You'd be better finding one
in town somewhere.

864
00:56:23,131 --> 00:56:26,050
Well, I don't want one in town.
I like that one.

865
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:28,469
Come on, Joe.

866
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:33,641
All right, I'll take $900 for it,

867
00:56:33,725 --> 00:56:35,059
if I get a new truck.

868
00:56:35,143 --> 00:56:37,228
All right! Shake hands.

869
00:56:37,312 --> 00:56:39,647
That's what I'm talking about. Heck, yeah.

870
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:11,095
Hey,

871
00:57:11,179 --> 00:57:12,889
what you got there?

872
00:58:46,607 --> 00:58:47,734
Hey!

873
00:58:48,151 --> 00:58:51,779
I was wondering if maybe you could tell me
how to get down to Water Valley.

874
00:58:52,739 --> 00:58:55,366
My wife, she in the hospital down there.

875
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:57,201
I just now got here.

876
00:58:58,286 --> 00:59:00,204
You know how far it is?

877
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:05,793
Is that the highway that goes to it?

878
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:07,795
IS it?

879
00:59:08,838 --> 00:59:10,506
What you drinking?

880
00:59:10,757 --> 00:59:11,966
Nothing.

881
00:59:12,759 --> 00:59:13,968
Nothing?

882
00:59:18,056 --> 00:59:20,641
You ain't drinking some wine, are you?

883
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:22,810
<i>I </i>

884
00:59:23,061 --> 00:59:24,353
Yeah, nothing wrong with that.

885
00:59:24,437 --> 00:59:27,398
Some folks think a feller ought not
drink at all,

886
00:59:27,482 --> 00:59:30,359
but a little drink never hurt nobody.

887
00:59:30,443 --> 00:59:31,903
That's right.

888
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:35,364
I get me a little drink every now and then
when I'm down at the house,

889
00:59:35,448 --> 00:59:38,826
but the old lady, she raises
so much sand about it,

890
00:59:39,077 --> 00:59:41,579
I don't do a lot of drinking down there.

891
00:59:41,662 --> 00:59:44,832
I usually wait until I get uptown
like I am now.

892
00:59:44,916 --> 00:59:46,459
Grab me a drink.

893
00:59:49,837 --> 00:59:51,255
She all right?

894
00:59:51,339 --> 00:59:53,299
Well, yeah, she is today.

895
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:57,220
That's why I'm trying to get down there
to Water Valley, to go see about her.

896
00:59:57,845 --> 01:00:00,056
I supposed to get paid today,

897
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:02,683
but the old fella, he never showed up.

898
01:00:03,768 --> 01:00:06,896
You know, so I think I'll go
get me a little drink,

899
01:00:06,979 --> 01:00:10,233
go down to Water Valley
and go see how she's doing.

900
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:12,902
She in the hospital?

901
01:00:12,985 --> 01:00:16,364
Yeah, she in the hospital. She got cancer.

902
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:19,075
Just eat up with it, all over.

903
01:00:19,867 --> 01:00:22,203
You know, damn thing...

904
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:25,414
You know, a person just don't know
from one day to the next

905
01:00:25,498 --> 01:00:27,834
which one's gonna be their last.

906
01:00:33,339 --> 01:00:35,842
Hell, it's a beautiful day out, but

907
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:38,594
feeling a little chill in my bones.

908
01:00:38,678 --> 01:00:40,847
I think it's fixing to rain.

909
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:43,766
Look like it's fixing to rain some...

910
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:21,637
Yeah. Here we go...

911
01:02:26,035 --> 01:02:29,038
<i>Three African painted dogs,</i>

912
01:02:29,455 --> 01:02:34,126
wild dogs, killed a three-year-old in a zoo.

913
01:02:34,752 --> 01:02:36,337
A toddler...

914
01:02:36,837 --> 01:02:38,839
He fell in, hit his head,

915
01:02:39,632 --> 01:02:40,925
the dogs got him.

916
01:02:42,802 --> 01:02:44,553
Where was everybody?

917
01:02:57,483 --> 01:02:59,235
He was a little kid.

918
01:03:09,203 --> 01:03:10,454
Hello, Joe.

919
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:12,373
How you doing?

920
01:03:17,336 --> 01:03:18,879
Son of a bitch.

921
01:03:20,756 --> 01:03:22,675
I tell you what, buddy.

922
01:03:24,427 --> 01:03:27,847
All this goddamn back and forth
and back and forth.

923
01:03:29,932 --> 01:03:31,726
I'm fucking over it.

924
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:34,729
Hell,

925
01:03:38,316 --> 01:03:39,984
maybe it's time we just...

926
01:03:40,776 --> 01:03:42,028
Bygones.

927
01:03:49,243 --> 01:03:51,495
You know I could have killed you, right?

928
01:03:51,579 --> 01:03:53,539
I could have killed you, but I didn't.

929
01:03:53,622 --> 01:03:56,625
I licked you, I was aiming for the trees, see.

930
01:03:57,084 --> 01:03:59,670
That shot was meant as a warning shot.

931
01:03:59,754 --> 01:04:01,672
'Cause all you keep doing
is embarrassing me

932
01:04:01,756 --> 01:04:03,758
in front of my goddamn friends.

933
01:04:05,051 --> 01:04:09,263
I mean, hell, last time you slapped me
there was ladies and gentlemen present.

934
01:04:13,893 --> 01:04:17,855
So what's this shit I hear
about this kid you got working for you?

935
01:04:19,357 --> 01:04:21,442
Little drifter kid,

936
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:23,069
about yay big?

937
01:04:25,613 --> 01:04:28,199
I don't really give a shit about him,

938
01:04:28,282 --> 01:04:31,452
but I suspect you know
where he lives, don't you.

939
01:04:32,787 --> 01:04:33,788
No?

940
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:39,627
What's wrong, spooky?

941
01:04:40,461 --> 01:04:42,296
Still sore at me?

942
01:04:58,437 --> 01:05:02,441
Kristy, call the cops before
somebody gets killed.

943
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:05,027
Will you do that for me, honey?

944
01:05:27,133 --> 01:05:28,342
Hold on!

945
01:05:31,262 --> 01:05:33,055
Hey, get back, hold on...

946
01:05:33,681 --> 01:05:36,058
- Hey, Joe.
-ls Merle around?

947
01:05:37,101 --> 01:05:39,520
Merle ain't here. You all right?

948
01:05:39,687 --> 01:05:41,439
I wanna get blown, but...

949
01:05:42,481 --> 01:05:44,316
That's right you don't like dogs, do you?

950
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,194
That's not true.
I love dogs, just not that dog.

951
01:05:47,278 --> 01:05:48,863
That dog is an asshole.

952
01:05:48,946 --> 01:05:50,156
I'm sorry, Joe.

953
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:53,033
Y'all help me
get this fucking dog outta here!

954
01:05:55,953 --> 01:05:57,037
<i>Jew.</i>

955
01:05:58,706 --> 01:05:59,999
<i>Jew.</i>

956
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:00,684
You busy?

957
01:07:00,935 --> 01:07:02,186
Come on.

958
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:23,499
Got any pets?

959
01:07:25,751 --> 01:07:26,961
I mean, I had a cat.

960
01:07:27,044 --> 01:07:28,796
Cat? Beautiful. What's his name?

961
01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:30,047
Missy.

962
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:32,841
- What'd you feed it?
- I don't know, fucking dry food.

963
01:07:32,967 --> 01:07:34,468
What's your favorite color?

964
01:07:34,552 --> 01:07:35,678
Red.

965
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:37,304
Blow me.

966
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:39,056
All right.

967
01:07:40,099 --> 01:07:42,643
Let me just focus on the snowflake.

968
01:07:42,726 --> 01:07:44,019
The snowflake on the wall.

969
01:07:44,103 --> 01:07:45,563
Okay, snowflakes.

970
01:08:03,414 --> 01:08:05,499
All right. All right. All right...

971
01:08:07,835 --> 01:08:08,919
Beg your pardon.

972
01:08:09,003 --> 01:08:10,629
All right, baby.

973
01:08:11,005 --> 01:08:12,506
It's all right.

974
01:08:15,843 --> 01:08:20,014
You don't have to run off.
I mean, you can stick around if you want.

975
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:22,850
Joe?

976
01:08:27,938 --> 01:08:29,023
Dog.

977
01:09:13,067 --> 01:09:14,401
Pull over!

978
01:09:14,485 --> 01:09:16,028
Pull over, now!

979
01:09:43,764 --> 01:09:45,224
Come on! What the fuck!

980
01:09:46,934 --> 01:09:48,268
Don't move!

981
01:09:48,894 --> 01:09:50,145
Freeze, Joe!

982
01:09:51,355 --> 01:09:53,357
Come on, put the gun down,

983
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,693
be a man about it,
and show me what you got!

984
01:09:55,776 --> 01:09:56,860
We got you surrounded, Joe.

985
01:09:56,944 --> 01:09:58,195
Hey, I'm just one dude.

986
01:09:58,278 --> 01:10:00,030
Freeze, Joe.
Put your hands behind your head!

987
01:10:00,114 --> 01:10:01,532
Come on! What are you gonna do?

988
01:10:01,615 --> 01:10:02,866
Look. I don't have nothing on me, man.

989
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:03,951
Freeze!

990
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:07,121
Why don't you guys both be like big boys,
and put your guns down,

991
01:10:07,204 --> 01:10:08,455
and let's talk about it.

992
01:10:08,539 --> 01:10:10,416
That's all I'm gonna do, just talk about it.
All right?

993
01:10:10,499 --> 01:10:11,875
- Bring it, Joe!
- Come on.

994
01:10:11,959 --> 01:10:13,210
Who's gonna cuff me?

995
01:10:13,293 --> 01:10:15,879
What do you got?
I'm feeling real good today.

996
01:10:15,963 --> 01:10:17,214
<i>Hey Joe?</i>

997
01:10:17,297 --> 01:10:18,799
You're in there, Joe?

998
01:10:24,388 --> 01:10:26,140
Coming in, Joe...

999
01:10:28,392 --> 01:10:29,643
Joe here?

1000
01:10:30,352 --> 01:10:31,729
You seen Joe?

1001
01:10:33,981 --> 01:10:35,482
What do you think, man?

1002
01:10:35,566 --> 01:10:37,901
You think Joe's gonna take care of you?

1003
01:10:37,985 --> 01:10:39,653
You think Joe's your daddy?

1004
01:10:39,737 --> 01:10:41,655
Is that what you think?

1005
01:10:41,947 --> 01:10:43,574
Joe ain't your daddy.

1006
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:45,117
I'm your daddy.

1007
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,494
I'm the one taking care of you.

1008
01:10:49,121 --> 01:10:50,873
You got some money?

1009
01:10:50,956 --> 01:10:54,334
I know you got some money
hid around here. Where's your money at?

1010
01:10:54,418 --> 01:10:56,837
I ain't got no damn money.
Joe didn't give me none today.

1011
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,130
Really?

1012
01:10:59,381 --> 01:11:00,883
Gimme some money.

1013
01:11:00,966 --> 01:11:03,719
I just told you I ain't got no damn money.

1014
01:11:09,057 --> 01:11:10,851
Ain't got no money?

1015
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:13,979
Got food.

1016
01:11:14,062 --> 01:11:15,856
You got food, God damn it!

1017
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:17,983
You got food, but you ain't got
no fucking money.

1018
01:11:18,066 --> 01:11:19,985
How'd you get the food?

1019
01:11:28,869 --> 01:11:32,706
What the hell you stumbling for?
You can't even take care of your damn self.

1020
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:41,882
Hey, that's my shit!

1021
01:11:44,843 --> 01:11:47,846
Knock your shit off, boy.
Knock your shit off.

1022
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:56,563
You ain't got no motherfucking money?

1023
01:11:58,899 --> 01:12:01,401
Hey, lookie here!

1024
01:12:01,485 --> 01:12:03,529
What seems to be the... Oh, yeah!

1025
01:12:03,612 --> 01:12:05,364
Yeah, yeah!

1026
01:12:05,447 --> 01:12:07,241
Yeah, yeah.

1027
01:12:07,574 --> 01:12:10,077
That's kinda what I fucking thought.

1028
01:12:10,577 --> 01:12:11,912
Bring it, motherfucker.

1029
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:13,372
Get the fuck back off me!

1030
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:20,629
How's that?

1031
01:12:23,799 --> 01:12:26,760
Just like that? Just like that.

1032
01:12:27,594 --> 01:12:29,805
Yeah. What?

1033
01:12:30,389 --> 01:12:34,101
You don't seem to be doing
a whole lot of talking right now.

1034
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,562
You kinda look like you in bad shape.

1035
01:12:36,645 --> 01:12:39,690
Who the hell do you think you are?
You ain't my daddy, you motherfucker!

1036
01:12:39,773 --> 01:12:42,860
Look at me! You seen what I did to
that motherfucker on the bridge?

1037
01:12:42,943 --> 01:12:44,319
I'll beat your ass!

1038
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:52,744
Son of a bitch, I'm about through
messing with you.

1039
01:12:53,203 --> 01:12:55,247
I been out looking for fucking money!

1040
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:57,374
I've been out looking for a fucking job

1041
01:12:57,457 --> 01:12:59,960
to feed your worthless fucking face!

1042
01:13:00,043 --> 01:13:03,630
Yeah, you stupid little piece of shit.

1043
01:13:09,177 --> 01:13:10,304
Yeah...

1044
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:14,099
I know you got money hid around here, boy.

1045
01:13:14,266 --> 01:13:15,726
You know what?

1046
01:13:15,809 --> 01:13:17,603
I'm gonna come back.

1047
01:13:17,769 --> 01:13:19,187
I'm gonna get it.

1048
01:13:19,271 --> 01:13:21,982
I'm gonna find it, and I'm gonna get it.

1049
01:13:45,923 --> 01:13:47,466
Hey, wake it up. Wake it up.

1050
01:13:47,549 --> 01:13:50,510
Earl, please get me
a goddamn cigarette, man.

1051
01:13:50,594 --> 01:13:52,554
Please, I'm begging you.

1052
01:13:54,056 --> 01:13:55,891
You're on your way out of here
anyway, man.

1053
01:13:55,974 --> 01:13:57,142
All right.

1054
01:13:57,225 --> 01:13:59,478
- I called your bondsman for you.
- Thanks, buddy.

1055
01:13:59,561 --> 01:14:01,271
How come he getting out of here?

1056
01:14:01,355 --> 01:14:05,192
Knock it off, Cokie! Knock it off!

1057
01:14:06,485 --> 01:14:08,695
Man. Thank you so much, buddy.

1058
01:14:11,448 --> 01:14:13,075
Thank you, buddy.

1059
01:14:15,202 --> 01:14:16,703
Fucking hell.

1060
01:14:21,792 --> 01:14:23,585
What do they got me charged with?

1061
01:14:23,669 --> 01:14:27,506
Shit, a heap.
DUI, assault on an officer, resisting arrest.

1062
01:14:27,589 --> 01:14:29,257
You want some more shit?

1063
01:14:29,341 --> 01:14:33,053
You know where they took my truck?
There's a kid that wants my truck.

1064
01:14:33,136 --> 01:14:35,889
Wasn't here last night.
But we can sure find out though.

1065
01:14:37,641 --> 01:14:41,061
You were 32 when you went
to the pen the first time.

1066
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:42,980
What are you now? 48? 49?

1067
01:14:43,063 --> 01:14:44,189
48.

1068
01:14:45,232 --> 01:14:47,025
Getting old, Joe.

1069
01:14:47,109 --> 01:14:50,404
Be a lot harder on you every time
from here on out.

1070
01:14:51,405 --> 01:14:54,449
But who am I to tell you how to live your life.

1071
01:14:55,033 --> 01:14:58,370
- Yeah. That's a good one.
- Come on, man.

1072
01:14:58,954 --> 01:15:01,081
Come on, get it together.

1073
01:15:01,164 --> 01:15:03,250
Shit, man. Are you kidding me?

1074
01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:07,963
Yeah, I'd like to get a number on a...
Like a dog rescue, or...

1075
01:15:09,965 --> 01:15:12,718
You don't have a number on a dog rescue?

1076
01:15:13,385 --> 01:15:16,138
Well, I'm reporting a lost dog.

1077
01:15:16,471 --> 01:15:18,932
Yeah, it's American Bulldog.

1078
01:15:21,059 --> 01:15:23,103
Brown and white, female,

1079
01:15:23,186 --> 01:15:24,563
90 pounds.

1080
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,990
What are you doing here?

1081
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:41,580
Mr. Coleman told me
you got into a little trouble with some cops.

1082
01:15:43,457 --> 01:15:45,083
That all you heard?

1083
01:15:47,044 --> 01:15:49,796
He said you got put up at that jail, too.

1084
01:15:56,178 --> 01:15:58,388
You don't still want my truck, do you?

1085
01:16:01,767 --> 01:16:03,018
Yes, sir.

1086
01:16:04,227 --> 01:16:05,437
You do?

1087
01:16:11,985 --> 01:16:14,321
He said you got put up
at the big jail one time.

1088
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,990
Coleman told you that?

1089
01:16:17,407 --> 01:16:18,575
Yeah.

1090
01:16:19,201 --> 01:16:20,827
Yeah, I have. I...

1091
01:16:21,995 --> 01:16:26,166
I did 29 months in the penitentiary
for assault on a police officer.

1092
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:34,341
They pulled me over
behind a shopping center uptown.

1093
01:16:35,133 --> 01:16:36,802
This one officer,

1094
01:16:37,052 --> 01:16:38,762
pretty-boy type guy,

1095
01:16:38,845 --> 01:16:40,055
had some issue with me.

1096
01:16:40,138 --> 01:16:42,933
Thought I had something to do
with one of the girls he knew.

1097
01:16:43,016 --> 01:16:46,103
And I didn't know what the hell
he was talking about.

1098
01:16:46,853 --> 01:16:48,980
Then they tried to shoot me,

1099
01:16:49,064 --> 01:16:51,775
after I beat the shit out of all three of them.

1100
01:16:51,858 --> 01:16:53,276
Or one did.

1101
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:58,323
Deputy went for his gun and I grabbed it.

1102
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,284
And...

1103
01:17:02,869 --> 01:17:06,039
Well, he was fixing to kill me,
he told me he was.

1104
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:11,962
All he did was blow his kneecap off...

1105
01:17:13,338 --> 01:17:14,714
The jackass.

1106
01:17:18,009 --> 01:17:19,636
My dog run off last night.

1107
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:21,179
You wanna go look for her?

1108
01:17:22,222 --> 01:17:23,223
Sure.

1109
01:17:28,186 --> 01:17:31,565
- You want me to drive the truck?
- Gotta start sometime.

1110
01:17:31,815 --> 01:17:33,817
Now look. Don't wave to them.

1111
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:36,319
Because they know you're guilty
of something when you wave.

1112
01:17:36,403 --> 01:17:37,487
Yes, sir.

1113
01:17:37,571 --> 01:17:40,407
Yeah, a cop can mess you up
if he wants to.

1114
01:17:41,283 --> 01:17:42,826
Yeah, I made the mistakes,

1115
01:17:42,909 --> 01:17:46,496
but they're the ones that won't
ever let me live it down.

1116
01:17:47,581 --> 01:17:49,916
Hey, can I buy one of them beers off of you?

1117
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,251
I don't know.

1118
01:17:53,170 --> 01:17:57,007
You can drink one of these beers,
but you cannot buy one from me.

1119
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:00,218
Friends don't ever need
to buy things from me.

1120
01:18:01,803 --> 01:18:03,930
There you go, nice and cold.

1121
01:18:04,139 --> 01:18:06,308
Now, keep your eyes peeled.

1122
01:18:06,391 --> 01:18:08,351
For the cops or the dog?

1123
01:18:08,935 --> 01:18:10,145
Both...

1124
01:18:13,023 --> 01:18:14,649
Cops or the dogs.

1125
01:18:15,066 --> 01:18:16,526
You hear that?

1126
01:18:16,902 --> 01:18:19,529
That's the sound that gets
the hookers excited.

1127
01:18:19,613 --> 01:18:22,282
They know you got cash. They hear that...

1128
01:18:29,164 --> 01:18:31,458
You wanna learn how to make a cool face?

1129
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:33,084
All right. Anatomy of a cool face.

1130
01:18:33,168 --> 01:18:34,961
Make a face of pain...

1131
01:18:35,712 --> 01:18:37,047
Now smile.

1132
01:18:37,505 --> 01:18:39,299
No, smile on top of the pain.

1133
01:18:39,382 --> 01:18:41,718
Hold the pain. Smile through it.

1134
01:18:41,968 --> 01:18:43,553
You ain't drunk, are you?

1135
01:18:43,637 --> 01:18:45,513
Shit, I'd better drive.

1136
01:18:45,931 --> 01:18:48,183
You know what, Gary? You got it made.

1137
01:18:48,266 --> 01:18:51,311
Because think about all
the beautiful girls you're gonna fuck.

1138
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:54,397
I used to know a girl that lived around here.

1139
01:18:54,481 --> 01:18:56,233
Shit, where's my dog?

1140
01:18:56,316 --> 01:18:57,901
I raised that dog from a pup.

1141
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:03,031
- Faith!
- There's lots of construction here,

1142
01:19:03,114 --> 01:19:04,908
because they're building a Hindu temple.

1143
01:19:04,991 --> 01:19:08,286
Gonna have lots of Bombanese kids.

1144
01:19:08,578 --> 01:19:11,206
Little red dots in the center of their head,

1145
01:19:11,289 --> 01:19:12,791
like a laser beam.

1146
01:19:12,874 --> 01:19:14,084
Faith!

1147
01:19:14,167 --> 01:19:16,002
You better work on that cool face.

1148
01:19:16,086 --> 01:19:18,338
You gotta stand like you own land, right?

1149
01:19:19,172 --> 01:19:21,675
Now, you make the pain face, right?

1150
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:24,052
You got a lot on your mind.

1151
01:19:24,135 --> 01:19:25,470
Now smile.

1152
01:19:26,763 --> 01:19:28,306
Yeah, it's like,

1153
01:19:28,556 --> 01:19:31,685
"I got a lot on my mind, but I can do it.
I can get through it."

1154
01:19:31,768 --> 01:19:33,353
Yeah, there you go, you're getting it.

1155
01:19:33,436 --> 01:19:34,688
Yeah, that's cool!

1156
01:19:45,991 --> 01:19:47,993
Dog weighs 100 pounds.

1157
01:19:48,076 --> 01:19:50,578
Has long ears, with a docked tail...

1158
01:19:50,662 --> 01:19:52,247
What was that?

1159
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:54,833
Yes, ma'am, I meant to get around
to doing that,

1160
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:57,168
but I did a halfway job on my dog.

1161
01:19:57,252 --> 01:19:58,586
A halfway jab?

1162
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:01,298
- Halfway, then.
- Well, halfway how?

1163
01:20:01,381 --> 01:20:02,757
Halfway.

1164
01:20:03,008 --> 01:20:04,092
Hello?

1165
01:20:04,175 --> 01:20:05,635
- Hello?
- Can I help you fellas?

1166
01:20:05,719 --> 01:20:09,306
Hello. So I'm missing my dog,
and the dog is...

1167
01:20:09,389 --> 01:20:11,683
- You want some of this?
- No, that stuff'll make you crazy.

1168
01:20:11,766 --> 01:20:13,852
Well now, I'm a pretty long way from crazy.

1169
01:20:13,935 --> 01:20:16,771
My dog is about 100 pounds,
brown and white,

1170
01:20:16,855 --> 01:20:18,231
looks like a cow.

1171
01:20:18,315 --> 01:20:19,524
- Looks like a cow?
- Right.

1172
01:20:19,607 --> 01:20:21,109
You have a dog that look like a cow.

1173
01:20:21,192 --> 01:20:23,653
Well, it's not that big a deal.
A lot of dogs look like cows.

1174
01:20:23,737 --> 01:20:26,072
But here's the thing,
if you happen to see my dog,

1175
01:20:26,156 --> 01:20:27,949
don't matter what time,

1176
01:20:28,033 --> 01:20:29,034
you call...

1177
01:20:29,868 --> 01:20:32,162
- Day or night. All right?
- Okay.

1178
01:20:32,245 --> 01:20:35,165
Have we already done passed
that place where you last saw your dog?

1179
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:36,499
No, Why?

1180
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:38,084
I think the dog'll be there.

1181
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:40,420
No, the dog run off.

1182
01:20:40,712 --> 01:20:43,423
If I was Dog, that's where Dog would be.

1183
01:20:43,715 --> 01:20:45,592
That's where I would go.

1184
01:20:46,468 --> 01:20:48,678
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Now, you be careful with him, okay?

1185
01:20:48,762 --> 01:20:49,763
All right.

1186
01:20:49,846 --> 01:20:50,930
Be careful driving, baby.

1187
01:20:51,014 --> 01:20:52,098
Call me.

1188
01:20:52,182 --> 01:20:53,308
Okay.

1189
01:21:12,535 --> 01:21:14,037
I'll be damned.

1190
01:21:25,131 --> 01:21:26,966
Now, wait. Wait, don't.

1191
01:21:37,185 --> 01:21:38,478
Dog likes you.

1192
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:39,854
It has a lot of scars.

1193
01:21:39,938 --> 01:21:41,106
Yeah,

1194
01:21:41,189 --> 01:21:42,899
but all the others,

1195
01:21:42,982 --> 01:21:44,776
all the others is dead.

1196
01:21:58,206 --> 01:22:00,667
Thanks for helping me find my dog.

1197
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:02,460
Yes, sir, no problem.

1198
01:22:02,544 --> 01:22:04,045
You work hard.

1199
01:22:05,505 --> 01:22:07,048
You got a good heart.

1200
01:22:07,507 --> 01:22:09,467
Anybody messes with you,

1201
01:22:09,926 --> 01:22:11,344
you let me know.

1202
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:13,805
I'll fuck them up.

1203
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,056
Right.

1204
01:22:23,898 --> 01:22:24,983
Take it...

1205
01:22:27,026 --> 01:22:28,486
You gonna need it.

1206
01:22:28,570 --> 01:22:30,363
- No.
- Get girls...

1207
01:22:32,115 --> 01:22:33,992
That's your mating call.

1208
01:22:41,207 --> 01:22:42,542
That's it.

1209
01:22:44,461 --> 01:22:45,462
You got it.

1210
01:22:49,757 --> 01:22:51,050
Thank you.

1211
01:22:51,134 --> 01:22:53,386
You need anything. You got it.

1212
01:22:57,974 --> 01:22:59,851
I'll take this one to the opera.

1213
01:22:59,934 --> 01:23:01,686
To the opera, yeah.

1214
01:23:09,986 --> 01:23:12,405
Shit, I don't have a lighter.

1215
01:23:15,116 --> 01:23:16,910
<i>The numbers from yesterday,</i>

1216
01:23:16,993 --> 01:23:19,704
<i>we had a high of 92, officially,</i>

1217
01:23:19,787 --> 01:23:23,750
<i>that's two degrees above
the average of 90 for the day.</i>

1218
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:25,168
<i>68 was our low...</i>

1219
01:23:40,433 --> 01:23:42,018
You got a light?

1220
01:23:42,477 --> 01:23:44,395
- Yeah.
- Hop in.

1221
01:24:03,164 --> 01:24:04,749
That boy's a good worker.

1222
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,463
That's the hardest fucking work
I ever done in my life.

1223
01:24:11,047 --> 01:24:12,799
- Is it?
- Yeah.

1224
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:15,593
- You paying my boy?
- What?

1225
01:24:15,677 --> 01:24:17,971
- Are you paying my boy?
- Hell, yeah!

1226
01:24:18,596 --> 01:24:20,557
I ain't seen he got paid none.

1227
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,767
Well, he probably saves it 'cause he's smart.

1228
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:24,644
Buying this GMC off of me.

1229
01:24:25,562 --> 01:24:26,604
Doing what?

1230
01:24:27,981 --> 01:24:29,274
- Nothing.
- Yeah.

1231
01:24:30,525 --> 01:24:32,193
He ain't so smart.

1232
01:24:32,569 --> 01:24:33,945
He don't know nothing.

1233
01:24:35,405 --> 01:24:37,240
Hell, neither do you.

1234
01:24:41,619 --> 01:24:43,830
I'm gonna shoot you straight.

1235
01:24:48,293 --> 01:24:50,295
That boy works his ass off!

1236
01:24:51,337 --> 01:24:52,922
He's earned money,

1237
01:24:53,006 --> 01:24:54,507
and it's his!

1238
01:24:55,592 --> 01:24:57,218
If this truck's a piece of shit,

1239
01:24:57,302 --> 01:24:59,095
then you need to get out of it.

1240
01:24:59,178 --> 01:25:02,140
And if I find out something
has happened to that boy,

1241
01:25:02,348 --> 01:25:05,518
I'm gonna whip whoever's ass
had something to do with it.

1242
01:25:06,394 --> 01:25:08,104
Now get the hell away from me,

1243
01:25:08,187 --> 01:25:11,316
before I knock what's left of your
fucking teeth out.

1244
01:25:35,757 --> 01:25:38,176
I had the funniest thought today.

1245
01:25:43,514 --> 01:25:47,852
I thought maybe you and I
could go out to dinner.

1246
01:25:51,981 --> 01:25:53,274
You know?

1247
01:25:54,317 --> 01:25:56,069
Get all dressed up.

1248
01:25:59,489 --> 01:26:03,993
And maybe you could
hold the door open for me.

1249
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:16,422
I think that would be nice.

1250
01:26:22,762 --> 01:26:24,764
You pretend to be asleep,

1251
01:26:27,392 --> 01:26:30,311
but I know you'd cry
if I said the wrong thing.

1252
01:26:56,504 --> 01:26:58,589
<i>You know this place is condemned, right?</i>

1253
01:26:59,382 --> 01:27:03,219
<i>You can't just take boards off windows
and call a place home.</i>

1254
01:27:07,473 --> 01:27:09,892
Gary, why do you stick around like this?

1255
01:27:11,144 --> 01:27:14,230
You're old enough, smart enough,
to do your own thing.

1256
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:18,192
What's most important right now is me

1257
01:27:18,276 --> 01:27:20,319
taking care of Dorothy and Momma,

1258
01:27:20,403 --> 01:27:24,824
'cause we kinda got
a family problem right now.

1259
01:27:30,413 --> 01:27:31,497
Hey, there.

1260
01:27:32,165 --> 01:27:33,207
Hey, now...

1261
01:27:35,293 --> 01:27:37,044
Don't talk much, does she?

1262
01:27:38,212 --> 01:27:39,547
She don't talk at all.

1263
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:40,882
What do you mean?

1264
01:27:41,257 --> 01:27:44,093
I don't know. Nobody knows.
She just stopped one day.

1265
01:27:44,177 --> 01:27:46,012
I mean she used to would, but...

1266
01:27:54,896 --> 01:27:57,523
Well, hey, I'm ready
to make this deal if you are.

1267
01:27:58,107 --> 01:27:59,317
Yeah.

1268
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:00,943
<i>L</i> 90'! my money.

1269
01:28:01,819 --> 01:28:02,987
Hey! G-Daawg.

1270
01:28:06,657 --> 01:28:09,285
Don't you think I forgot about it, bud.

1271
01:28:10,745 --> 01:28:13,372
I've been looking for you and that kid.

1272
01:28:14,707 --> 01:28:16,334
That boy of yours,

1273
01:28:16,876 --> 01:28:19,212
he sure thinks he knows something.

1274
01:28:19,879 --> 01:28:21,464
I know you, mister.

1275
01:28:21,547 --> 01:28:23,049
You my friend?

1276
01:28:24,592 --> 01:28:26,385
I ain't your friend.

1277
01:28:26,844 --> 01:28:29,764
Well, you like to make all them funny faces.

1278
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:31,349
I said, are you my friend?

1279
01:28:31,432 --> 01:28:33,184
Listen, buddy.

1280
01:28:34,894 --> 01:28:38,314
I think I know a way
that you and me can be friends.

1281
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:48,074
There it is.

1282
01:28:51,369 --> 01:28:55,164
It looks just like your old one.
Periwinkle blue. I like it.

1283
01:28:55,748 --> 01:28:57,416
I hope so.

1284
01:28:59,043 --> 01:29:01,671
Now, you got plenty of gas to get home.

1285
01:29:01,754 --> 01:29:03,381
You might want to stop at Coleman's

1286
01:29:03,464 --> 01:29:06,509
and put a little more in it
if you plan to ride around.

1287
01:29:06,592 --> 01:29:07,885
Here.

1288
01:29:07,969 --> 01:29:10,012
- What's that?
-It's money for the truck.

1289
01:29:10,096 --> 01:29:11,556
Hell. I ain't worried about that.

1290
01:29:11,639 --> 01:29:15,518
You just stick it back in your pocket.
You're gonna need it for insurance.

1291
01:29:15,977 --> 01:29:17,937
- What's the insurance?
- Well, yeah, it's a law.

1292
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:20,022
You can't drive without insurance.

1293
01:29:20,106 --> 01:29:23,359
You're covered now, but when I sign it over,
you gotta pick up the insurance.

1294
01:29:23,442 --> 01:29:25,486
I'll tell you what,
you come out to the house before long,

1295
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:26,904
we'll get you fixed up.

1296
01:29:26,988 --> 01:29:28,614
I'm gonna go on. You gonna be all right?

1297
01:29:28,698 --> 01:29:30,449
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

1298
01:29:32,535 --> 01:29:34,036
You want me to follow you?

1299
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:35,621
No, I'll be all right.

1300
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:39,041
Hey, Joe.

1301
01:29:40,459 --> 01:29:41,544
Thanks.

1302
01:31:06,337 --> 01:31:08,130
- Nice truck.
- Thanks.

1303
01:31:08,714 --> 01:31:10,508
You ain't got any tags on it.
Did you just get it?

1304
01:31:10,591 --> 01:31:11,717
Yeah.

1305
01:31:11,884 --> 01:31:13,386
You wanna breathe into this for me?

1306
01:31:13,469 --> 01:31:15,012
No, I don't want to breathe into that.

1307
01:31:15,096 --> 01:31:16,806
Hey. Hey! Hey!

1308
01:31:50,923 --> 01:31:52,216
Pull over!

1309
01:31:53,759 --> 01:31:55,094
Pull over!

1310
01:32:05,396 --> 01:32:08,357
God damn it! I ain't done a goddamn thing!

1311
01:32:08,441 --> 01:32:09,942
- Stay in your vehicle!
- I ain't drunk.

1312
01:32:10,026 --> 01:32:12,528
You better look for someone else
to mess with, 'cause I did nothing!

1313
01:32:12,611 --> 01:32:14,864
- Put your hands behind your back.
- You and your motherfucking friends

1314
01:32:14,947 --> 01:32:16,365
keep messing around with me,
I'm gonna hurt you...

1315
01:32:16,449 --> 01:32:17,616
Put your hands behind your...

1316
01:32:18,659 --> 01:32:19,869
Come here!

1317
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:22,455
I guess if I drive off now,

1318
01:32:22,538 --> 01:32:24,790
you're gonna get your shotgun
out of the back and shoot me?

1319
01:32:24,874 --> 01:32:26,083
- No.
- You gonna shoot me?

1320
01:32:26,167 --> 01:32:27,293
- No.
- You can do it.

1321
01:33:07,458 --> 01:33:08,793
That was quick.

1322
01:33:09,251 --> 01:33:11,170
Still got that badass dog?

1323
01:33:11,837 --> 01:33:13,923
Yeah, around here somewhere.

1324
01:33:14,006 --> 01:33:15,382
Hold on a minute.

1325
01:33:16,133 --> 01:33:17,551
Don't worry, okay.

1326
01:33:17,635 --> 01:33:19,762
Don't worry. Don't worry.

1327
01:33:19,845 --> 01:33:21,180
Don't worry.

1328
01:33:22,848 --> 01:33:24,183
All right.

1329
01:33:27,728 --> 01:33:29,688
I hear you got a new grandbaby.

1330
01:33:29,897 --> 01:33:32,108
- I do?
- Yeah, you didn't know?

1331
01:33:32,817 --> 01:33:34,235
Not until now.

1332
01:33:35,361 --> 01:33:36,821
Yeah. Little boy.

1333
01:33:36,904 --> 01:33:38,823
Marcy saw him at church.

1334
01:33:40,366 --> 01:33:43,202
Said he looked just like
you'd expect him to look.

1335
01:33:46,372 --> 01:33:47,748
She said he's got your eyes.

1336
01:33:51,627 --> 01:33:52,878
You Okay?

1337
01:33:53,712 --> 01:33:55,798
Your son's all grown now, ain't he?

1338
01:33:56,048 --> 01:33:57,424
Yeah, all grown up.

1339
01:33:57,508 --> 01:33:59,677
What's he going into? Law enforcement?

1340
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,554
That's what I heard.

1341
01:34:02,930 --> 01:34:05,891
You got a new man working for you now,
don't you?

1342
01:34:05,975 --> 01:34:07,518
Yes, I do.

1343
01:34:07,893 --> 01:34:09,562
I believe you've met him.

1344
01:34:09,645 --> 01:34:11,814
Gung ho fella, a little over-eager.

1345
01:34:11,897 --> 01:34:14,024
He was looking for someone to fuck with.

1346
01:34:14,108 --> 01:34:15,943
Yeah, maybe so.

1347
01:34:16,026 --> 01:34:20,698
I'll have his ass shuffling papers for a while
until he learns to cool down a little bit.

1348
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:23,367
But that ain't what I'm worried about.

1349
01:34:24,869 --> 01:34:26,954
Will you pass the hot sauce?

1350
01:34:30,416 --> 01:34:33,752
Let me ask you a question, Joe,
'cause I really want to know.

1351
01:34:34,628 --> 01:34:36,422
Why you wanna go back?

1352
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:39,925
Why you wanna go back
to the damn penitentiary, man?

1353
01:34:44,889 --> 01:34:47,391
Because you can't keep going
to folks' houses,

1354
01:34:47,474 --> 01:34:50,436
killing their dogs,
don't matter what else is going on.

1355
01:34:50,519 --> 01:34:52,938
And you can't keep fist-fighting the law.

1356
01:34:53,939 --> 01:34:57,151
Judge won't put up with it.
He don't have to put up with it.

1357
01:34:57,234 --> 01:34:59,486
That's why they build prisons.

1358
01:35:05,284 --> 01:35:07,536
Now you done got me back
to smoking, damn it.

1359
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:09,788
I been quit for three weeks.

1360
01:35:12,791 --> 01:35:15,002
I haven't mistreated you, Joe.

1361
01:35:15,544 --> 01:35:18,130
Have I? Tell the truth.

1362
01:35:18,672 --> 01:35:19,965
No, Earl.

1363
01:35:20,174 --> 01:35:22,343
You stuck up for me when you could.

1364
01:35:23,010 --> 01:35:25,304
And I used to be as bad as you.

1365
01:35:26,222 --> 01:35:29,225
At one time, you were worse.

1366
01:35:31,477 --> 01:35:34,146
Yeah, but I'm cool now.

1367
01:35:45,532 --> 01:35:47,618
Connie. Where'd you go, baby?

1368
01:35:50,496 --> 01:35:52,498
Answer the phone next time.

1369
01:36:29,285 --> 01:36:31,704
<i>Joe, is it you? Estas aqui?</i>

1370
01:36:54,059 --> 01:36:55,561
Yeah, it's me.

1371
01:37:16,874 --> 01:37:17,958
Shit.

1372
01:37:19,084 --> 01:37:20,252
What happened?

1373
01:37:20,336 --> 01:37:22,254
I need to borrow the truck.

1374
01:37:22,838 --> 01:37:24,631
What happened to you?

1375
01:37:25,215 --> 01:37:26,550
I'm gonna kill him.

1376
01:37:27,134 --> 01:37:29,386
I'm gonna kill that old son of a bitch.

1377
01:37:29,470 --> 01:37:31,680
You think I won't, but I Will.

1378
01:37:33,849 --> 01:37:35,976
And I'm gonna get mine back.

1379
01:37:37,811 --> 01:37:39,438
I just need to borrow that truck.

1380
01:37:39,521 --> 01:37:40,856
Come inside.

1381
01:37:42,107 --> 01:37:43,484
Come here.

1382
01:37:50,616 --> 01:37:52,117
Don't touch me.

1383
01:37:52,284 --> 01:37:54,119
I should've given you a boxing lesson.

1384
01:37:54,203 --> 01:37:56,705
I don't need no goddamn boxing lesson.
I know what to do.

1385
01:37:56,789 --> 01:37:58,957
I'll pop him right in the eye.

1386
01:38:00,626 --> 01:38:03,504
He whooped my ass
and threw me out the truck.

1387
01:38:03,837 --> 01:38:05,839
Because he knew that I was gonna kill him.

1388
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,470
I could kill his ass.

1389
01:38:12,137 --> 01:38:14,431
I could kill him just as good as you could.

1390
01:38:15,265 --> 01:38:17,643
I know you could. I know you could.

1391
01:38:17,726 --> 01:38:19,061
I know it.

1392
01:38:19,186 --> 01:38:21,355
But you don't have to do that.

1393
01:38:22,022 --> 01:38:23,357
Okay, son.

1394
01:38:24,108 --> 01:38:25,984
Just stay here with me.

1395
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:28,695
You'll be safe here.

1396
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:32,199
I'll bring your momma and your sister.

1397
01:38:32,282 --> 01:38:33,909
He's got Dorothy.

1398
01:38:35,661 --> 01:38:37,538
He done ran off with her.

1399
01:38:37,621 --> 01:38:39,039
He met up with some bad men.

1400
01:38:39,123 --> 01:38:41,166
I heard him talking about it.

1401
01:38:42,167 --> 01:38:44,086
That man with the scarred-up face,

1402
01:38:44,169 --> 01:38:46,839
the one that I beat down by the bridge.

1403
01:38:49,383 --> 01:38:52,302
He's been looking for me
for what I done did to him.

1404
01:38:53,011 --> 01:38:55,180
She didn't hurt nobody, Joe.

1405
01:38:56,265 --> 01:38:58,183
It should have been me.

1406
01:39:03,355 --> 01:39:05,691
Do you know where they took her?

1407
01:39:08,527 --> 01:39:09,653
Gary,

1408
01:39:11,113 --> 01:39:12,364
tell me.

1409
01:39:17,911 --> 01:39:19,163
Tell me.

1410
01:39:20,956 --> 01:39:22,833
I just need the truck.

1411
01:39:23,333 --> 01:39:24,918
To get me some place.

1412
01:39:34,428 --> 01:39:36,346
I'm gonna make trouble.

1413
01:39:43,812 --> 01:39:45,397
Meet me outside.

1414
01:40:52,297 --> 01:40:53,507
$30.

1415
01:40:55,342 --> 01:40:56,969
$30 each.

1416
01:41:20,993 --> 01:41:22,077
Hi.

1417
01:41:23,078 --> 01:41:25,330
Hi, how are you doing?

1418
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:30,002
You Okay?

1419
01:41:31,003 --> 01:41:32,170
No?

1420
01:41:34,715 --> 01:41:36,300
Tell me something,

1421
01:41:36,383 --> 01:41:38,176
you like funny faces?

1422
01:42:15,047 --> 01:42:18,508
If anything happens to me,
you get your ass outta the way. You hear?

1423
01:42:18,592 --> 01:42:20,260
You take my truck and get out.

1424
01:42:21,887 --> 01:42:23,221
And go get Coleman.

1425
01:42:23,305 --> 01:42:24,473
Yes, sir.

1426
01:42:25,515 --> 01:42:27,351
Tell him to call Earl.

1427
01:42:48,914 --> 01:42:50,082
Shit.

1428
01:42:51,917 --> 01:42:53,543
No,no,no!

1429
01:43:00,926 --> 01:43:02,594
- Don't move.
- God damn it.

1430
01:43:02,678 --> 01:43:04,179
I'll kill you both if you move.

1431
01:43:04,262 --> 01:43:06,807
Joe, listen to me. This...
It ain't what it looks like, man.

1432
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:08,016
I'm telling you.

1433
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:10,102
Dorothy! Dorothy!

1434
01:43:10,185 --> 01:43:11,853
Get her out, Gary.

1435
01:43:11,937 --> 01:43:13,772
Take your sister and go.

1436
01:43:13,855 --> 01:43:15,107
Go. Go!

1437
01:43:16,441 --> 01:43:18,443
You, I don't know you.

1438
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:21,196
- Run, before I shoot you.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1439
01:43:22,364 --> 01:43:25,283
God damn it, Joe. Listen to me.
Just listen to me, okay?

1440
01:43:27,452 --> 01:43:28,537
Gary!

1441
01:43:29,246 --> 01:43:30,330
Gary!

1442
01:43:32,332 --> 01:43:34,292
- Gary!
- I'll get help, Joe.

1443
01:43:42,467 --> 01:43:45,095
God damn it. And that girl, she don't...

1444
01:43:46,513 --> 01:43:48,098
She don't know shit about shit, man.

1445
01:43:48,181 --> 01:43:50,517
She's just a piece of trash
just like her daddy.

1446
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:53,562
And she's gonna be doing this shit
in no time, I'm telling you.

1447
01:43:53,645 --> 01:43:54,896
I'm telling you, man.

1448
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:56,648
Look at the moon.

1449
01:44:18,211 --> 01:44:19,296
God damn it!

1450
01:44:24,509 --> 01:44:26,136
Fuck this shit.

1451
01:44:28,054 --> 01:44:30,307
If you want to shoot me,
go ahead and shoot me.

1452
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:33,059
I went through a windshield
and I don't give a...

1453
01:45:51,388 --> 01:45:53,348
Are you my friend?

1454
01:47:47,837 --> 01:47:50,090
What have you done, Joe?

1455
01:50:15,110 --> 01:50:16,528
<i>Here's what we do.</i>

1456
01:50:17,195 --> 01:50:21,366
<i>We start a little late, around 8:00
in the morning, and we go until 4:00.</i>

1457
01:50:21,449 --> 01:50:24,869
I pay by the week, on Fridays.
Some days we go long.

1458
01:50:24,953 --> 01:50:28,623
If we run past 40 hours a week,
I pay time and a half.

1459
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:30,542
It's hard work.

1460
01:50:31,209 --> 01:50:33,253
I don't like a whole lot of standing around.

1461
01:50:33,336 --> 01:50:37,632
We'll probably bust our ass
and get this spread out by the end of April.

1462
01:50:37,715 --> 01:50:39,801
Get out all the bare root seedlings.

1463
01:50:39,884 --> 01:50:43,263
Sometimes, we stake them if we got to
keep the little ones stable.

1464
01:50:43,346 --> 01:50:48,143
Most of the time we don't need to mess
with them little pine seedlings like that.

1465
01:50:48,226 --> 01:50:52,480
I'm gonna have you join Don L. and his crew
on the west end of the farm.

1466
01:50:52,564 --> 01:50:54,858
Then if everything goes good
on that acreage,

1467
01:50:54,941 --> 01:50:59,279
I'll have you help me supervise
the Manea project next summer.

1468
01:50:59,696 --> 01:51:02,699
Old bastards can be hard
to work for sometimes.

1469
01:51:03,366 --> 01:51:05,660
But hell, if you worked for Joe,

1470
01:51:06,578 --> 01:51:08,580
I think you'll do just fine.

1471
01:51:09,289 --> 01:51:10,832
You got any questions?

1472
01:51:10,915 --> 01:51:12,667
No, sir. When can I start?

1473
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:14,294
Right now, if you're ready.

1474
01:51:14,377 --> 01:51:15,670
Yes, sir.

1475
01:51:17,672 --> 01:51:19,215
So you knew Joe?

1476
01:51:19,299 --> 01:51:20,508
Yeah, sure did.

1477
01:51:20,592 --> 01:51:22,260
Joe's a good man.

1478
01:51:22,677 --> 01:51:24,596
Good man to me anyways.

1479
01:51:26,264 --> 01:51:27,390
Good man to me too.
