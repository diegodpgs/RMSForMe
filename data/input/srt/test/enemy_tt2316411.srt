1
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,001
<i>Hello, darling. It's your mother.</i>

2
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,570
<i>Thank you for showing me
your new apartment. Um...</i>

3
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,167
<i>I'm worried about you.</i>

4
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,521
<i>I mean, how can you live like that?</i>

5
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,731
<i>Anyway, would you call me back?
Let's get together again.</i>

6
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,926
<i>I love you.</i>

7
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,326
<i>Control.</i>

8
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,925
<i>It's all about control.</i>

9
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,441
<i>Every dictatorship has one obsession.</i>

10
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,001
And that's it.

11
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,055
So, in ancient Rome,

12
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,401
they gave the people bread and circuses.

13
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,324
They kept the populace busy
with entertainment.

14
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,169
But other dictatorships
use other strategies to control ideas.

15
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,090
The knowledge.

16
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,049
How do they do that?

17
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,890
Lower education.

18
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,529
They limit culture.

19
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,611
Censor information.

20
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,361
They censor any means
of individual expression.

21
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,895
And it's important to remember this,
that this is a pattern

22
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,605
that repeats itself throughout history.

23
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,441
Okay.

24
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,963
See you next week.

25
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,920
<i>- Hi.</i>
<i>- Hi.</i>

26
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,086
How are you?

27
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,201
I'm good.

28
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,084
<i>See, every dictatorship,</i>

29
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,935
there's only one obsession and that's control,

30
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,883
they want to have control over the people.

31
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,767
In ancient Rome,
they gave bread and circuses,

32
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,648
<i>they kept the populace
busy with entertainment.</i>

33
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,127
<i>In other dictatorships,
they have other strategies.</i>

34
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,655
<i>To limit information,
to limit ideas and knowledge.</i>

35
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,326
<i>How do they do that?</i>

36
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,770
<i>They lower education, limit culture.</i>

37
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,969
<i>They censor any means of self-expression.</i>

38
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,810
<i>But it's important to remember this,
this is a pattern</i>

39
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,401
<i>that repeats itself</i>

40
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,170
<i>throughout history.</i>

41
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,166
You don't go to the movies, do you?

42
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,481
Movies?

43
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,329
Yeah, are you a movie guy?

44
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,004
In your free time, I mean?

45
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,442
I don't know,

46
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,128
I don't go out that much,
I don't really like movies.

47
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,655
Oh.

48
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,655
You don't have to go out
to enjoy a good flick at home.

49
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,966
That's true.

50
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,282
I usually just rent them.

51
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,855
Most people don't these days,

52
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,121
but it's what I do.

53
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,001
Is there a reason why you're asking me this?

54
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,201
No.

55
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,695
'Cause you brought it up and
I thought, you know, maybe

56
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,135
you had a recommendation,
or you saw a movie that you liked

57
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,730
and you want to tell me about it.

58
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,401
Oh, sure, I mean, there's always something.

59
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,406
- I could go for something cheerful.
- Hmm.

60
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,920
<i>Where There's a Will There's a Way.</i>

61
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,246
It's true.

62
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,445
No, it's a movie, I saw it
a little while ago, but, um...

63
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,735
I remember, I liked it.

64
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,055
Hmm. <i>Where There's a Will There's a Way.</i>

65
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,206
Yeah, that's it.

66
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,890
Local film, if you...

67
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,809
I'll keep it in mind.

68
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,524
I think I'm drunk.

69
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,764
You wanna go to bed?

70
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,281
Hmm?

71
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,490
You wanna go to bed?

72
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,767
No, I'm gonna finish grading these papers

73
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,247
and then I'll come join you, okay?

74
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,335
<i>Mr. Henderson,
my husband will be back.</i>

75
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,966
<i>Your husband just won
a heck lot of money from me.</i>

76
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,361
<i>By the look in his eye
he didn't have an intention to...</i>

77
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,961
Ow!

78
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,645
Stop!

79
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,481
Stop!

80
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,775
Okay, okay, okay.

81
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,650
What's wrong?

82
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,810
I'll call you tomorrow.

83
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,490
Sorry I'm late.

84
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,841
Uh...

85
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,641
All right.

86
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,655
Last class we talked about dictatorship,

87
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,160
so today we'll start with Hegel.

88
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,205
It was Hegel who said that
all the greatest world events happen twice.

89
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,655
And then, Karl Marx added,
the first time it was a tragedy,

90
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,762
and the second time it was a farce.

91
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,246
<i>It's strange to think...</i>

92
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,655
<i>A lot of the world's thinkers are worried</i>

93
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,526
<i>that this century will be
a repetition of the last one.</i>

94
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,775
<i>And there's an interesting observation,
a creative act of memory</i>

95
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,255
<i>to remember something,
to remember somebody...</i>

96
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,163
I'm looking for <i>Call me L8R</i> or
<i>Passenger Without a Ticket.</i>

97
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,601
Shit.

98
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,482
Anthony?

99
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,051
Anthony!

100
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,608
Hey, long time no see!

101
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,735
I couldn't tell it was you with that beard.
Is that for a movie?

102
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,761
Yeah.

103
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,091
Man, you haven't been around here for ages.

104
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,135
Yeah, I don't know how long it's been.

105
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,685
Six months, I'd say.

106
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,246
Six months or more.

107
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,688
Yeah, so how's everything?

108
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,161
Great.

109
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,575
Are you meeting someone here?
'Cause there's no one around.

110
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,601
- No?
- No,

111
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,246
you know no one comes in on Saturdays.

112
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,290
Oh...

113
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,769
I was supposed to pick up the thing...

114
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,575
For the movie. Um...

115
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,895
And I forgot it was Saturday...
'Cause my head is, like...

116
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,615
You actors are something else.

117
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,086
Hold on, let me see if there's anything for you.

118
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,201
Great.

119
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,564
Yeah, here it is, look.

120
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,135
Oh, that looks like it's it.
That's definitely it. That's definitely it.

121
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,095
- There you go. All right?
- Okay.

122
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,135
- Hey, don't be a stranger.
- I won't be.

123
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,455
Good luck with that movie.

124
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,686
Great, I will... Yes.

125
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,129
Anthony Claire.

126
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,923
3650 Rathburn Road.

127
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,135
<i>Hello?</i>

128
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,561
- Good afternoon, I'm calling...
<i>- Hey.</i>

129
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,009
Um, I'm calling to speak to...

130
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,455
<i>Where are you calling from?</i>

131
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,695
I'm sorry,
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

132
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,455
I'm calling to speak to
Daniel Saint Claire, the...

133
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,766
<i>Anthony?</i>

134
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,689
<i>Anthony, you called home.</i>

135
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,002
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

136
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,009
<i>What are you doing?</i>

137
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,327
My name's not Anthony.

138
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,487
<i>You're not Anthony?</i>

139
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,367
No, I'm calling to speak
to Daniel Saint Claire, the actor. Um...

140
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,765
If I'm not mistaken, that's Anthony Claire's

141
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,651
name that
he uses for the movies.

142
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,524
For his work.

143
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,449
<i>Right.</i>

144
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,095
<i>Right, well, Daniel isn't here right now,</i>

145
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,088
<i>maybe I could get him to call you back.</i>

146
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,444
Okay, I'm sorry to bother you.

147
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,485
<i>What?</i>

148
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,561
What?

149
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,725
I... I...

150
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,730
<i>Who is this?</i>

151
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,015
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

152
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,695
He doesn't know me.

153
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,095
No.

154
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,215
- Okay. I'm gonna...
<i>- Anthony?</i>

155
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,895
I'll call back later.

156
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,775
<i>Hello?</i>

157
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,723
Hello, this is Anthony...

158
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,575
This is Anthony Claire, isn't it?

159
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,170
<i>Who's calling?</i>

160
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,481
Um...

161
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,615
I called before.
I was talking... I talked to your wife. Crazy.

162
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,295
<i>You're the one.</i>

163
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,975
<i>And you call here again, I will call the police...</i>

164
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,049
I... No, no. Just hear me out.

165
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,929
Can you say something again?
Can you talk again?

166
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,655
<i>Who is this?</i>

167
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,055
That's crazy.
That's amazing.

168
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,243
Our... Your voice is just like mine.
Do you hear my voice?

169
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,520
Your voice is just like mine.

170
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,731
Shit.

171
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,615
<i>- Listen...</i>
- Sorry, please, please, please.

172
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,815
Just listen to me for a second.

173
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,895
Just listen, okay? Just hear me out.

174
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,855
I know this sounds crazy.
I'm sorry. I got excited before.

175
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,535
When I get excited, I just act a little strange.

176
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,215
So just hear me out for a second.

177
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,655
I've seen three of your movies.

178
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,695
And you're great in them.
You're great in them.

179
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,335
We look exactly alike.

180
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,615
And I called your wife earlier today.

181
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,735
And she said that...
She thought that I was you.

182
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,855
And I'm just... I'm confused.

183
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,655
And I know this call must
be just as confusing for you as it is for me.

184
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,815
And I just...
My name is Adam Bell. I'm a history teacher.

185
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,683
And I just think that we should meet.

186
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,895
Hey, hey, hey, okay. Okay.

187
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,924
Listen to me. Never call here again.

188
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,815
Who was that?

189
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,683
It was that same guy.

190
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,935
What did he want?

191
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,135
I don't know. He sounded crazy.

192
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,775
Like, he sounded like a stalker or something.

193
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,855
A stalker?

194
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,135
Yeah, he said that he was a fan of mine.

195
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,925
That he wanted to, uh, meet up or something.

196
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,645
- What?
- Mmm-hmm.

197
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,645
- No.
- Yeah.

198
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,609
You're messing with me.

199
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,251
Right?

200
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,843
- Anthony?
- Uh...

201
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,970
Do you want to get something to eat?

202
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,803
Who was on the phone?

203
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,975
Helen, the same guy who called before.
The same guy.

204
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,082
That's who was on the phone.

205
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,927
I told you that.
Why would I tell you any differently?

206
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,606
Are you lying to me?

207
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,485
I...

208
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,335
You're lying to me.

209
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,169
You're acting crazy.

210
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,975
I'm not crazy. Who was on the phone?

211
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,765
I told you it was a man who was on the phone.

212
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,804
Are you seeing her?

213
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,135
Helen, I don't want to get into this.

214
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,128
Are you seeing her again?

215
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,286
We need to get something to eat.

216
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,495
Let's go get something to eat and then...

217
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,735
I don't want to get anything...

218
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,161
It was a man! It was a man.

219
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,615
What do you think it was, a jealous husband?

220
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,801
Yeah.

221
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,135
I don't want to get into this again. Okay?

222
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,366
I don't want to get into this.

223
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,403
I'm going for a walk.

224
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,775
Yes.

225
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,855
<i>Yeah, it's me, man.</i>

226
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,935
That's so strange.
I had a feeling that you were gonna call.

227
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,042
<i>You had a feeling, what's that mean?</i>

228
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,015
It's a, you know,
just a figure of speech. It's not...

229
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,695
<i>Right. All right.
Well, look, I've been thinking about it.</i>

230
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,210
<i>I want to meet.</i>

231
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,891
Okay.

232
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,255
<i>I know a place called the Breezeway Inn.</i>

233
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,335
<i>It's about an hour outside the city.
Do you know where that is?</i>

234
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,735
No.

235
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,575
<i>All right. Well, then I'll call
you on Sunday with directions.</i>

236
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,329
<i>1:00, okay?</i>

237
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,495
Okay.

238
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,055
<i>All right.</i>

239
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,081
Uh-huh.

240
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,567
- Well, see you soon.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

241
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,602
<i>Yeah, I'll see you soon.</i>

242
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,081
Hello.

243
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,527
Hi.

244
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,726
Is everything all right?

245
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,045
How many months are you?

246
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,561
Uh...

247
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,885
Six.

248
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,890
That's nice.

249
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,850
I should be going.
I have a class, I have to teach in it.

250
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,766
Ah...

251
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,815
Never know how your day is gonna turn out.

252
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,524
Have a nice day.

253
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,364
<i>What's up, honey?</i>

254
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,966
<i>Hello?</i>

255
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,486
<i>Hello?</i>

256
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,130
Hi.

257
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,248
It is a scorcher out there.

258
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,335
The last 10 minutes of my run,

259
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,975
this 22-year-old kid
or something like that, he was...

260
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,367
He was following me the whole time.

261
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,844
Never gonna beat this kid.

262
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,175
And he dropped.

263
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,171
Do you think that I should cut my beard
off 'cause it's fucking hot?

264
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,655
Wait, why did you call me earlier?
Did you call me for a reason?

265
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,003
Honey, where are the blueberries?

266
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,575
Where are the blueberries?

267
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,935
I told you, like, two days ago.

268
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,495
The organic blueberries.
Not the conventional blueberries.

269
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,363
I can't use 'em in the shake.

270
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,815
What's wrong?

271
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,375
<i>I wasn't...
Only I was saying 'cause I read it</i>

272
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,695
<i>in a magazine that blueberries,</i>

273
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,122
<i>the organic ones are better
than conventional ones...</i>

274
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,920
Are you gonna tell me what's wrong?

275
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,691
I...

276
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,410
I went to...

277
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,608
I went to see that guy.

278
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,361
Who? What're you talking about?

279
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,055
The guy on the phone.

280
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,128
I went to his work.

281
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,335
Why did you do that?
That's dangerous, honey.

282
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,089
I wanted to know.

283
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,490
Are you okay?

284
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,407
He had the same voice.

285
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,321
He looks exactly like you.

286
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,760
What do you mean, "Exactly like me"?

287
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,920
What's happening?

288
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,123
I don't...
Really don't know what you're talking about.

289
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,410
I think you know.

290
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,804
I think you know.

291
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,606
Hello?

292
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,771
I told you.

293
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,367
- Show me your hands, man.
- Why?

294
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,163
Come on, show me your hands.

295
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,041
Maybe we're brothers.

296
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,128
We're not...
We're not brothers. We're not brothers.

297
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,210
How do you know?

298
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,170
Do you have a...

299
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,891
Do you have a scar on your chest?

300
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,565
This one?

301
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,729
You do, don't you?

302
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,455
I, uh...

303
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,404
- When's your birthday?
- This was a bad idea.

304
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,082
I think I made a mistake here.

305
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,561
Um...

306
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,575
I have a...

307
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,895
I have this. I went to...

308
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,570
The company that represents you,

309
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,695
they gave that to me... To you.

310
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,609
I'm sorry.

311
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,451
I'm sorry.

312
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,975
Don't worry, honey.

313
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,843
That guy won't be calling here again.

314
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,840
Fuck.

315
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,775
There must be some difference.

316
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,847
There isn't.

317
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,007
It cannot be exactly the same.

318
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,605
We are.

319
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,735
Did you take your clothes off in front of him?

320
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,807
No.

321
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,535
Okay, then.

322
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,130
You didn't eat.

323
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,531
The last thing you need
is to be meeting strange men in hotel rooms.

324
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,851
You have enough trouble
sticking with one woman, don't you?

325
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,366
Here.

326
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:16,961
I don't like blueberries.

327
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,887
Of course you do, and they're good for you.

328
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,725
I am going to pretend
I never heard a word of what you just told me.

329
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,015
I just wanted your advice.

330
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:33,522
You don't want advice.
I don't want to hear any more about this.

331
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,725
You are my only son.

332
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,006
I am your only mother.

333
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,403
You have a respectable job,
you have a nice apartment,

334
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,285
and since we're being frank here,

335
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,295
I think you should quit that fantasy

336
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,402
of being a third-rate movie actor.

337
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,847
Eat those. You want some coffee?

338
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,402
<i>I have a question for you.</i>

339
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,889
Did you fuck my wife?

340
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:31,248
Did you fuck my wife?
Did you sleep with my wife?

341
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,685
You fucked my wife!

342
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,525
Did you fuck my wife?

343
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,451
That's good. That is fuckin' good.

344
01:01:55,640 --> 01:02:00,095
This is what's gonna happen.
You're giving me your clothes and your car.

345
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:03,841
I'm gonna take your girlfriend
on a little romantic getaway.

346
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,403
<i>Tomorrow, I bring her home.</i>

347
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,367
<i>And I'm gonna come back here,</i>

348
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,646
<i>bring back all your things, and I'm gonna
disappear from your life forever.</i>

349
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,809
<i>And then I'll be gone.</i>

350
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,841
What are you doing here?

351
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,004
What the fuck is this place, man?
You live here?

352
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,535
I have some questions for you.

353
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,050
Please go or I'll call the police.

354
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,855
Go ahead, call the police.
What are you gonna tell 'em?

355
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,404
What are you gonna tell 'em, man?

356
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:01,001
Why'd you come looking for me?

357
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,361
I don't know. I don't know. I just...

358
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,201
I needed to know.

359
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,455
You need to know. Yeah. Okay.

360
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:15,849
But when you called my house,
you talked to my wife.

361
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,969
Why'd you do that?

362
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,455
She happened to pick up the phone.

363
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:23,845
Okay. Yeah, but...

364
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,280
Can I ask you something, just man to man?

365
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:36,761
Um...

366
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,604
Did you sleep with my wife?

367
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,375
I don't know what you're talking about.

368
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,243
Did you fuck my wife?

369
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,127
This is crazy.

370
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,375
Just answer the question, man.

371
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,575
Just answer
my fuckin' question and then I will leave.

372
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,601
You're fuckin' crazy.

373
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,525
All right.

374
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:08,080
I'm fuckin' crazy? I'm fuckin' crazy?

375
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,683
I'm fuckin' crazy?

376
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,924
I'm fuckin' crazy?

377
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,449
You brought my wife into this, man.

378
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:23,335
So I'm gonna bring
your girlfriend into the picture as well.

379
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,895
You want me out of your life?
This is what's gonna happen first.

380
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,535
You're gonna give me
your clothes and your car.

381
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,415
I'm gonna take your girlfriend
on a little romantic getaway.

382
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,775
I'm gonna bring her back home tomorrow,
and I'm gonna come back here,

383
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,895
and I'm gonna bring back all your stuff

384
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,969
and I'm going to disappear
from your life forever.

385
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,563
Then we will be even.

386
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:39,604
Mr. Claire. Good afternoon.
Everything good?

387
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,848
Yeah, I just...

388
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,205
Uh, forgot my keys.

389
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,604
Is Mrs. Claire not home?

390
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,535
Do you want me to open the door for you?

391
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:59,289
That'd be perfect. Yeah.

392
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:25,400
I can't stop thinking about the other night.

393
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,209
Can't get it out of my head.

394
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,160
I know I shouldn't talk about this,

395
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,523
but I'd love to go back.

396
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,121
Uh-huh.

397
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:51,646
I heard they changed the lock
and sent out new keys.

398
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:54,015
But...

399
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:56,805
I don't think I'm on the list.

400
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,890
I need to go back.

401
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:14,647
I'll see what I can do. I don't...

402
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:18,404
I don't know if that's going to be possible.

403
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,570
Call me if you hear anything.

404
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:29,761
After you.

405
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,095
Okay. Here you go, Mr. Claire.

406
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,281
Thank you.

407
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:19,966
Hello?

408
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,043
- Anthony?
- Hi.

409
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,521
The light's on, you freaked me out.

410
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:57,361
Sorry.

411
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,561
What're you doing home?
I thought you were at your mom's.

412
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,127
Oh, I canceled it, I...

413
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,009
Should've called.

414
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,648
I stayed longer at the pool,

415
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,691
'cause I thought you weren't gonna be home.

416
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:34,320
Uh...

417
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,325
Do you need anything?

418
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,761
I'm fine.

419
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,283
I'm gonna go to bed.

420
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:50,721
Okay.

421
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,006
Are you sure you don't need anything?

422
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,285
'Cause you...

423
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,615
When you came in
and you said that you went to the pool,

424
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:01,015
I just thought maybe
that you've been there for a long time,

425
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,615
and you had to walk home
or whatever and you must be...

426
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,926
Is everything okay?

427
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,935
You're six months pregnant, so I didn't know.

428
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,200
No, I'm fine.

429
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,523
Why don't you come to bed?

430
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:43,921
I...

431
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:00,531
Aren't you gonna take your clothes off?

432
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,606
Yeah.

433
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,250
Did you have a good day at school?

434
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,561
What?

435
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,005
Forget it.

436
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,775
What? What? What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

437
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:55,881
Mary. Mary. Mary.

438
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:02,681
<i>What's wrong?</i>

439
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:06,441
The ring. The mark on your finger.

440
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,928
What are you talking about?

441
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:14,801
I've always had this.

442
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,528
No. No!

443
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:27,895
Who are you?
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

444
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,922
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?

445
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,082
- Don't touch me!
- What are you talking about?

446
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,608
The ring. The mark on your finger.

447
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:34,720
What's wrong?

448
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,130
What's wrong?

449
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,649
I just couldn't sleep.

450
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,488
Yeah, I couldn't sleep either.

451
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,090
I'm sorry.

452
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:06,168
Why are you doing this to me?

453
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:09,165
What? What am I doing to you?

454
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:17,529
I want you to stay.

455
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:21,166
- Stop the car.
- Stop the car? Stop the car?

456
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,335
<i>- Stop the fucking car.</i>
<i>- I'll stop the fucking car.</i>

457
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,521
<i>You want me to stop the car?</i>

458
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,280
Get out. I'm sick of this shit.

459
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,000
<i>I can't even talk to you.</i>

460
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,207
Fuck you.

461
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,840
You're behaving like a child.

462
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:33,855
<i>You're not a man.</i>

463
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:35,855
- I'm not a man?
- Enough. You don't need to get me started.

464
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,041
<i>I'm not a man?</i>

465
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:40,441
I'm not a fucking man? Get out! Get out!

466
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,440
- Get out! Get the fuck out!
- Let go!

467
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,775
<i>Sunshine, a high of 24 today,</i>

468
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:32,167
<i>clear tonight with a low of 13.</i>

469
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:34,330
<i>Here's James with a look at traffic.</i>

470
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,415
<i>The westbound Lake Shore is closed
between Bathurst and Strachan,</i>

471
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:40,569
<i>as crews clean up debris from a collision
that happened early this morning.</i>

472
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,855
<i>Police have not released
any details at this time,</i>

473
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,575
<i>but we do know there was only one vehicle.</i>

474
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:39,161
I forgot to tell you that your mother called.

475
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,855
You should probably call her back.

476
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:42,881
Okay.

477
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:11,410
Helen, did you plan on
doing something tonight?

478
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,882
'Cause I think I have to go out.

479
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:26,651
Helen?

480
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,451
Helen?
