1
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:27,175
<i>On the day the world ended...</i>

2
00:00:27,258 --> 00:00:32,592
<i>the fate of mankind was carried
in a small metal box.</i>

3
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,633
<i>In a secret location, architects,
scientists and engineers met...</i>

4
00:00:46,717 --> 00:00:50,175
<i>and concluded that there was
only one hope for our future:</i>

5
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,592
<i>To build an underground city...</i>

6
00:00:54,675 --> 00:00:58,383
<i>designed to keep its citizens
protected for generations to come.</i>

7
00:01:10,217 --> 00:01:12,717
Secure the box.

8
00:01:12,842 --> 00:01:14,717
Set it for 200 years.

9
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,133
We'll keep them in the city for 200 years.

10
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:21,758
You're certain
that'll be long enough?

11
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:25,758
None of us can be certain of anything.
We can hope.

12
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,800
<i>Growing up with no knowledge
of a world outside...</i>

13
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:34,550
future generations will be spared sorrow
for what they've lost.

14
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:44,591
For the good of all mankind.

15
00:01:47,883 --> 00:01:50,800
<i>The box was entrusted to the first mayor...</i>

16
00:01:50,883 --> 00:01:53,133
<i>who was to pass it on
to her successor.</i>

17
00:02:00,758 --> 00:02:02,675
<i>As the years counted down...</i>

18
00:02:02,758 --> 00:02:06,133
<i>the box passed from mayor to mayor.</i>

19
00:02:06,216 --> 00:02:08,383
<i>None knew what secrets it held...</i>

20
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:11,716
<i>only that it would open
when it was needed most.</i>

21
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:17,591
<i>But fate ran another course...</i>

22
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:21,216
<i>and the chain was broken.</i>

23
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:33,925
<i>The box was tucked away
and forgotten...</i>

24
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:37,008
<i>and as the city grew
old and began to crumble...</i>

25
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:41,716
<i>the box quietly clicked open.</i>

26
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,175
- Dad, do you hear that?
- Uh, hurry up. You don't wanna be late.

27
00:03:33,258 --> 00:03:36,216
<i>- I am hurrying.
- I'm proud of you, Son.</i>

28
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,633
- Today's a big day.
- Yeah.

29
00:03:38,716 --> 00:03:42,466
I just hope I don't get assigned
some useless job.

30
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,591
<i>You can't control what job you get on
Assignment Day. That's not the point.</i>

31
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:49,258
<i>The important thing is to do-</i>

32
00:03:49,341 --> 00:03:51,758
your part.

33
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:57,466
One, two, three, four...

34
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:02,550
five, six, seven, eight-

35
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:09,258
They're getting longer.

36
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:12,341
<i>- That one was.
- Yeah, and it's the third one this week.</i>

37
00:04:12,425 --> 00:04:14,466
The Generator's
our only source of power.

38
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,550
<i>- All Electricians and Wiremen-
- If it goes-</i>

39
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:18,675
<i>- are advised to report to their stations.
- we all go.</i>

40
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:22,466
- That's dramatic.
- Dad, this place is falling apart.

41
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,758
No, I will not just sit around
while Ember collapses.

42
00:04:26,841 --> 00:04:29,591
I'm getting into that Generator,
whatever it takes.

43
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:01,424
Congratulations...

44
00:05:01,508 --> 00:05:05,341
on achieving
this momentous occasion:

45
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:08,549
your Assignment Day.

46
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:14,383
I'm late!

47
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:16,966
- Lina, are you and your granny all right?
- Yeah, we're fine.

48
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:19,716
- You all right, Mr. Tock?
- Just another blackout, Lina.

49
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:22,758
Hi.

50
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:33,424
<i>Be you eight or 18, the time has come...</i>

51
00:05:33,508 --> 00:05:35,799
<i>- to answer the call to service.
- Hi, Mr. Boaz.</i>

52
00:05:35,883 --> 00:05:38,883
- Stop!
- Produce the Book Of The City Of Ember.

53
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,049
- You need to sign in!
- I'm late!

54
00:05:59,549 --> 00:06:01,466
Psst! Lizzie.

55
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:08,174
<i>- We swear-
- Eternal loyalty to our city.</i>

56
00:06:08,258 --> 00:06:11,508
We declare our infinite gratitude
to the Builders...

57
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:13,508
who chose this site
with the greatest care.

58
00:06:13,591 --> 00:06:16,508
We flourish above
our mighty flowing river.

59
00:06:16,591 --> 00:06:20,841
We thrive thanks to the unbounded
capacity of our mighty Generator...

60
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:23,841
beating at our very center
like a magnificent heart.

61
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:28,466
Beyond Ember, the darkness
goes on forever in all directions.

62
00:06:28,549 --> 00:06:31,508
Ours is the only light in a dark world.

63
00:06:33,258 --> 00:06:35,216
It's true.

64
00:06:44,174 --> 00:06:46,091
Bag.

65
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:01,299
Be the first to discover your future.

66
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:05,716
Reach in, young man.

67
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:11,841
Read it aloud.

68
00:07:11,924 --> 00:07:14,799
Electrician's Helper.

69
00:07:15,883 --> 00:07:18,008
I get to work in the Generator.

70
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:22,133
<i>Timekeeper's Assistant.</i>

71
00:07:22,216 --> 00:07:24,133
<i>You get to work with clocks.</i>

72
00:07:27,758 --> 00:07:31,174
<i>- Building Repair Assistant.
- They have a lot of fun.</i>

73
00:07:33,383 --> 00:07:35,716
<i>- Greenhouse Helper.
- That-a girl.</i>

74
00:07:37,174 --> 00:07:40,383
<i>- Potato Peeler.
- You're gonna come in handy.</i>

75
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,883
- Warehouse Clerk.
- A vital job.

76
00:07:56,674 --> 00:07:59,174
Pick one, young lady.

77
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:12,883
Pipeworks?

78
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:16,049
Louder, so we can all hear.

79
00:08:17,883 --> 00:08:19,882
I'm a Pipeworks Laborer.

80
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,424
You're a very fortunate girl.
That is an important job.

81
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:36,716
- Mold Scraper.
- We got a Mold Scraper. Great.

82
00:08:46,632 --> 00:08:50,257
Messenger.

83
00:08:55,674 --> 00:08:58,382
<i>- I picked a dull job, but compared to yours-
- Lina.</i>

84
00:08:58,466 --> 00:09:00,091
<i>- mine's a shining light bulb.
- Lina.</i>

85
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:02,091
- Scream if you need me.
- Trade with me.

86
00:09:02,132 --> 00:09:04,924
- What?
- Swap jobs. Please. You have to.

87
00:09:05,007 --> 00:09:07,466
You want to work in the Pipeworks?

88
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:11,216
I want to be Electrician's Helper and work
in the Generator, but Joss won't swap.

89
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:13,174
I would rather die
than be a Messenger.

90
00:09:13,257 --> 00:09:15,591
I don't want to waste my
time while the whole city crumble-

91
00:09:15,674 --> 00:09:19,341
- Yes. Yes.
- What?

92
00:09:26,174 --> 00:09:28,216
- Thank you, Doon!
- Thanks!

93
00:09:35,632 --> 00:09:38,799
<i>* The light from the lamp is not all *</i>

94
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:42,799
- * There is a brighter light **
- Mrs. Murdo!

95
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,924
- How was your Assignment Day?
- I'm a Messenger!

96
00:09:46,007 --> 00:09:49,674
That's wonderful, Lina!
Congratulations!

97
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,216
Granny!

98
00:09:54,216 --> 00:09:56,591
Granny! Where are you?

99
00:09:57,674 --> 00:10:00,591
I'm a Messenger.

100
00:10:00,632 --> 00:10:04,591
You shouldn't make things up.
You-You're not a Messenger, Lina.

101
00:10:04,674 --> 00:10:06,716
But today was Assignment Day,
remember?

102
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,799
<i>Oh.</i>

103
00:10:09,882 --> 00:10:12,966
- Where's Poppy?
- Poppy?

104
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:17,632
- Poppy?
- She was helping me look for something.

105
00:10:17,716 --> 00:10:19,882
I- Here's Poppy.

106
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:25,466
Poppy.

107
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:28,924
<i>Poppy.</i>

108
00:10:28,966 --> 00:10:32,007
Poppy, take that out of your mouth.

109
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,007
Here.

110
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:38,549
- It's for you.
- Thank you.

111
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:51,049
- I made it.
- Yeah, I can tell.

112
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:57,132
- Uh, what's it for?
- It's for your graduation.

113
00:10:57,216 --> 00:11:00,882
I mean, what does it do?

114
00:11:00,966 --> 00:11:02,924
You'll figure it out.

115
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:10,757
There's more to a bottle cap than
keeping liquid from leaking out of glass.

116
00:11:10,841 --> 00:11:15,507
The main thing is, pay attention.

117
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:19,174
Pay close attention to everything-
everything you see.

118
00:11:19,257 --> 00:11:21,966
<i>Notice what no one else notices...</i>

119
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:25,049
and you'll know
what no one else knows.

120
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:28,882
<i>What you get is what you get.</i>

121
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,507
What you do with what you get-

122
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,341
<i>That's more the point.</i>

123
00:11:35,424 --> 00:11:38,299
Wouldn't you say?

124
00:11:38,382 --> 00:11:40,716
Really useful, Dad.

125
00:11:43,632 --> 00:11:45,882
Don't you want to eat?

126
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:48,216
I'm not hungry.

127
00:11:50,215 --> 00:11:53,090
<i>I mean, we'll have to replace those.</i>

128
00:12:07,382 --> 00:12:09,507
Hey.

129
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:13,507
Shh, shh, shh, shh. Hey, it's okay.

130
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,507
You hurt your wing.

131
00:12:18,424 --> 00:12:20,465
Hmm.

132
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:32,799
- Good night, Lina.
- Good night, Poppy.

133
00:12:34,257 --> 00:12:37,340
I'll play you the voices
while you fall asleep, okay?

134
00:12:45,215 --> 00:12:48,224
<i>Yoo-hoo.</i>

135
00:12:48,507 --> 00:12:50,465
<i>Yoo-hoo.</i>

136
00:12:52,424 --> 00:12:54,965
Anybody home?

137
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:57,257
<i>Don't hold dinner for me, darling.</i>

138
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,090
<i>I'll be there before lights out.</i>

139
00:13:00,174 --> 00:13:03,882
<i>Mrs. Mayfleet, your shoes are ready.</i>

140
00:13:03,965 --> 00:13:08,549
Hi, Raine. It's Clary.

141
00:13:08,632 --> 00:13:12,507
The sprinkler system's down
again in number two.

142
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:16,965
Raine, it's me, Barrow.

143
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:19,257
I've been thinking about it.

144
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,507
I watch my boy and...

145
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,965
<i>I've come around.
I've changed my mind.</i>

146
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:28,049
<i>I'm in.</i>

147
00:13:30,632 --> 00:13:32,424
<i>Where do you go?</i>

148
00:14:21,924 --> 00:14:23,840
Lina Mayfleet, reporting for duty!

149
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,132
You're early, Mayfleet.

150
00:14:31,132 --> 00:14:33,132
At ease. At ease.

151
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,757
8:00!

152
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,757
Stations, everybody!

153
00:15:18,882 --> 00:15:21,757
- It's beautiful.
- Wear it proudly.

154
00:15:21,798 --> 00:15:25,548
Take care of it.
Always keep it in good repair.

155
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:27,632
I will.

156
00:15:29,215 --> 00:15:31,340
Your station is Garn Square.

157
00:15:31,423 --> 00:15:34,090
Stop!

158
00:15:34,173 --> 00:15:37,882
I need to tell you the rules.

159
00:15:37,965 --> 00:15:39,965
One: When a customer-

160
00:15:40,048 --> 00:15:42,423
Gives you a message, repeat it back
to make sure you've got it right.

161
00:15:42,507 --> 00:15:45,423
Two: Always wear the red cape
so people can identify you.

162
00:15:45,465 --> 00:15:48,007
<i>Three: Our customers pay
20 coins for every message...</i>

163
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,882
no matter how far we have
to carry it, so go fast.

164
00:15:50,923 --> 00:15:52,923
I love going fast.

165
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:55,507
Very good. I'm impressed.

166
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,507
Now go!

167
00:16:02,173 --> 00:16:05,298
Sit. Sit.

168
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:09,298
These overalls will go
over your clothes.

169
00:16:09,382 --> 00:16:12,340
That belt will have
all the tools you'll need.

170
00:16:12,423 --> 00:16:15,257
And I think there's enough traction
left in these boots.

171
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,965
You need traction to work the pipes.

172
00:16:19,048 --> 00:16:21,215
<i>- Thank you.
- Now, this locker is yours.</i>

173
00:16:21,298 --> 00:16:24,798
You can put in your shoes
and whatnots.

174
00:16:24,882 --> 00:16:27,298
- All right?
- Okay.

175
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:30,382
All right. Try this.

176
00:16:32,965 --> 00:16:35,715
You've got a big head.

177
00:16:36,757 --> 00:16:38,590
Try this one.

178
00:16:38,673 --> 00:16:40,590
Oh, that fits.

179
00:16:41,673 --> 00:16:44,257
All right, now.
Cut your name in there.

180
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,507
- Why?
- Why?

181
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,215
In case something happens to ya.

182
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:53,257
The guy who wore this helmet
before you drowned.

183
00:16:53,298 --> 00:16:57,340
If he hadn't cut his name in there,
we wouldn't have known who he was.

184
00:16:58,423 --> 00:17:00,423
Here. Use this.

185
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:09,757
I think I can figure out what's wrong
with the Generator.

186
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:13,673
When can I see it? Hmm?

187
00:17:14,757 --> 00:17:18,382
<i>Done.</i>

188
00:17:18,423 --> 00:17:20,757
Sul?

189
00:17:32,757 --> 00:17:35,132
Twenty coins, please.

190
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:47,298
Hey, slow down.

191
00:17:54,298 --> 00:17:56,090
Clary!

192
00:17:58,007 --> 00:18:00,298
<i>Clary! It's me.</i>

193
00:18:00,382 --> 00:18:02,548
Look at you.

194
00:18:02,632 --> 00:18:04,715
<i>- Roner told me.
- You're my first message.</i>

195
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:06,923
That's great. I'm ready.

196
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:08,923
From Arbin Swinn,
the vegetable vendor.

197
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:11,132
Let me have it.

198
00:18:13,882 --> 00:18:17,673
"If this is a potato,
then I'm 16 and sexy. "

199
00:18:23,048 --> 00:18:24,965
<i>Help!</i>

200
00:18:42,673 --> 00:18:44,590
<i>Stay back.</i>

201
00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:47,173
<i>He could be contaminated.
He's been in the Unknown Region.</i>

202
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:49,173
<i>Don't go near 'im.</i>

203
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:53,090
I couldn't see it, but I ran right into it.
I swear. It was as big as a house.

204
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,423
I was just trying to get out
along the river.

205
00:18:56,506 --> 00:18:59,465
<i>It was so dark. I grabbed onto it.</i>

206
00:18:59,548 --> 00:19:02,006
<i>- I had to, before it grabbed me!
- Don't touch him!</i>

207
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:06,090
Stand back! Back!

208
00:19:06,173 --> 00:19:08,590
I had to! No! Ow!

209
00:19:08,631 --> 00:19:13,465
I knew it was dark,
but I had no idea how dark.

210
00:19:13,548 --> 00:19:16,881
I couldn't see anything.

211
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,590
<i>Why would he risk being thrown in jail-</i>

212
00:19:21,673 --> 00:19:24,923
when everyone knows
it's against the law to go out there?

213
00:19:25,006 --> 00:19:27,513
<i>Come on, move!</i>

214
00:19:27,548 --> 00:19:30,131
There's far too much to do
here to worry about out there.

215
00:19:32,215 --> 00:19:35,631
Your father would have known
how to fix these potatoes.

216
00:19:38,756 --> 00:19:41,090
Don't dig too deep, Lina.

217
00:19:55,006 --> 00:19:58,965
<i>- The whole thing is rusted.
- Yep.</i>

218
00:19:59,048 --> 00:20:01,048
- You know, it ought to be replaced, Sul.
- Yep.

219
00:20:01,131 --> 00:20:05,340
- So where do you store new pipe?
- New pipe?

220
00:20:06,423 --> 00:20:09,131
We haven't had new pipe...

221
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:11,631
since my second decade here.

222
00:20:11,715 --> 00:20:13,631
Yeah.

223
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:16,298
We've been patchin' so long,
we have more patches than pipe.

224
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,298
Here, hold that.

225
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:20,465
Attaboy. That's good.

226
00:20:20,548 --> 00:20:23,756
Round and round we go. There.

227
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,756
All right, we'll check it.

228
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:29,215
Squeeze it.

229
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,756
Is it holdin'?

230
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,298
Uh, so far.

231
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:41,840
So far? So far is so good.

232
00:20:41,923 --> 00:20:43,840
Oh.

233
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,381
- W-What's gonna happen?
- Same as always.

234
00:20:48,423 --> 00:20:50,215
- What's that?
- We'll cope.

235
00:20:50,298 --> 00:20:52,090
But what about the blackouts?
They're getting worse.

236
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:54,090
- They're-They're-They're-
- Slow down, kid.

237
00:20:54,131 --> 00:20:56,756
You have to learn
to take things as they come.

238
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:05,006
Well, what's th-
What's this tunnel called?

239
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,506
It's Tunnel 25. And this is 26.

240
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,715
How do you know?

241
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:17,340
Come on.

242
00:21:20,006 --> 00:21:21,923
<i>- What's that for?
- Pressure.</i>

243
00:21:23,006 --> 00:21:25,465
<i>Waterwheel.</i>

244
00:21:25,548 --> 00:21:27,506
And this?

245
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,298
Don't know. It's not my job.

246
00:21:30,381 --> 00:21:33,881
But you've worked here forever.
How could you not know?

247
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:36,506
Mindin' my own business keeps me-

248
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,006
keeps me busy enough.

249
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:43,340
Uh, can we go into the Generator?

250
00:22:25,589 --> 00:22:29,048
There's gotta be another way
into the Generator.

251
00:23:05,673 --> 00:23:08,589
Huh. This tunnel's been erased.

252
00:24:49,423 --> 00:24:52,256
Hey! What are you doing here?

253
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:55,381
- You don't work in the storeroom.
- You're-You're Looper.

254
00:24:55,464 --> 00:24:58,923
- Uh, your brother was in my class.
- Oh.

255
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:02,048
Thanks for the enlightening information.
Is that why you're here?

256
00:25:02,131 --> 00:25:04,089
- No. I'm training in the Pipeworks.
- Huh?

257
00:25:04,131 --> 00:25:05,798
- I'm training in the Pipeworks. I saw this-
- Huh?

258
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:08,339
This rope. I-I-I got lost. I'm sorry.

259
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:11,464
- Yeah, well, get lost again!
- Oh!

260
00:25:11,548 --> 00:25:14,131
You okay?

261
00:25:14,214 --> 00:25:16,131
Huh.

262
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:49,672
<i>I'm over here!</i>

263
00:25:57,881 --> 00:26:00,256
<i>Lights, come on.</i>

264
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:03,172
<i>- Help me!
- Please.</i>

265
00:26:03,256 --> 00:26:05,464
Please come on.

266
00:26:05,547 --> 00:26:07,381
<i>Lina? Lina?</i>

267
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:09,422
<i>- Doon?
- Lina, keep talking.</i>

268
00:26:09,464 --> 00:26:11,422
Doon, where are you?

269
00:26:11,464 --> 00:26:13,839
Where are you? Hey, you okay?

270
00:26:13,922 --> 00:26:15,839
- Yeah.
- Keep talking. Are you okay?

271
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:17,922
Yeah, I'm okay.

272
00:26:19,006 --> 00:26:21,089
Something's not right.

273
00:26:21,172 --> 00:26:24,214
<i>They never last this long.</i>

274
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:29,131
- What's that sound?
- It's the Generator.

275
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:31,922
<i>- But they can fix it, right?
- Maybe for now.</i>

276
00:26:32,006 --> 00:26:34,797
But we're-
We're running out of time.

277
00:26:34,881 --> 00:26:37,464
We have to do something.

278
00:26:37,547 --> 00:26:39,631
<i>There was a man this morning.</i>

279
00:26:39,714 --> 00:26:43,006
He came back from the Unknown Regions.
He said he heard water.

280
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:45,756
Did you ever think
there might be a way out?

281
00:26:47,089 --> 00:26:49,006
<i>A way out of Ember?</i>

282
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:54,672
<i>All Pipeworkers.</i>

283
00:26:54,756 --> 00:26:56,797
<i>All Pipeworkers,
Electricians and Engineers-</i>

284
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:59,089
<i>- Look, I need to get down the Pipeworks.
- report immediately.</i>

285
00:26:59,172 --> 00:27:01,381
- You stay safe, Lina, okay?
- Doon.

286
00:27:01,464 --> 00:27:04,214
<i>- Attention, all Pipeworkers.
- Doon! Wait!</i>

287
00:27:04,297 --> 00:27:06,339
<i>All Pipeworkers, Electricians,
Engineers, report immediately.</i>

288
00:27:06,422 --> 00:27:08,339
Where'd you get that?

289
00:27:08,422 --> 00:27:12,089
- I think it came from some kind of animal.
- No, where did you get it?

290
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,547
A man came back with it
from the Unknown Regions.

291
00:27:14,631 --> 00:27:16,631
It's from a beetle.

292
00:27:16,714 --> 00:27:18,797
<i>- Messenger!
- It's beautiful.</i>

293
00:27:18,881 --> 00:27:21,422
<i>- Can I keep it?
- I have a message.</i>

294
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:24,797
Miss Sample, I need to get home
and check on my granny first.

295
00:27:24,881 --> 00:27:28,047
Pass the message as you go.
Tell everybody.

296
00:27:34,297 --> 00:27:36,381
Seven minutes!

297
00:27:36,464 --> 00:27:39,422
The power failure lasted seven minutes!

298
00:27:39,464 --> 00:27:41,381
Twice as long as we've ever had!

299
00:27:41,422 --> 00:27:43,381
* It was so strong *

300
00:27:43,422 --> 00:27:47,797
* But we live by the joy of our song *

301
00:27:47,881 --> 00:27:49,964
* The city shines- **

302
00:27:51,881 --> 00:27:53,839
Granny!

303
00:28:28,589 --> 00:28:30,547
No time! You better move!

304
00:28:31,714 --> 00:28:34,256
It's out of control!

305
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:36,756
- It's here somewhere.
- What's here?

306
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:42,006
Somewhere. Something.
It's very, very important.

307
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:44,839
My great granddaddy-
He told me this.

308
00:28:44,922 --> 00:28:47,797
Wait here.

309
00:28:47,881 --> 00:28:51,464
Poppy, no. Give me that.

310
00:28:51,547 --> 00:28:53,464
Spit it out.

311
00:28:54,381 --> 00:28:56,631
Poppy, come on.

312
00:28:56,714 --> 00:28:59,631
Pop- Mmm! Fine.

313
00:28:59,714 --> 00:29:02,464
You're ruining the couch, Granny.

314
00:29:04,756 --> 00:29:08,297
You-You found it.

315
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,339
- This is what you're looking for?
- Uh-huh.

316
00:29:12,422 --> 00:29:14,339
Are you sure?

317
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:18,255
What's so special about it?

318
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,630
I don't- I forget. I don't remember.

319
00:29:28,297 --> 00:29:31,130
I don't remember.

320
00:29:32,755 --> 00:29:34,672
Okay, Granny.
I've gotta get back to work.

321
00:29:34,755 --> 00:29:36,714
Okay.

322
00:29:37,797 --> 00:29:41,130
<i>See ya, Pop.</i>

323
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:53,005
Joss?

324
00:29:53,089 --> 00:29:54,880
<i>- Joss.
- Don't bother asking.</i>

325
00:29:54,922 --> 00:29:57,089
The Generator's broken.
It's hopeless.

326
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:59,380
<i>Next load!</i>

327
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,589
<i>I have a message for Seely Schnap.</i>

328
00:30:02,672 --> 00:30:05,172
<i>I'm Seely Schnap. What is it?</i>

329
00:30:05,255 --> 00:30:07,714
- Munn Millders sent me.
- He did?

330
00:30:07,797 --> 00:30:10,380
He wants me to tell you that he
can't come over for lunch today.

331
00:30:10,464 --> 00:30:11,797
Oh.

332
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,964
He said that your house
is too far away from his...

333
00:30:14,047 --> 00:30:16,005
and he's afraid of the blackouts.

334
00:30:25,297 --> 00:30:27,255
I have a message...

335
00:30:27,339 --> 00:30:29,672
for the mayor.

336
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:33,880
"Your ship is in. "

337
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,505
Good day, Messenger.

338
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:55,589
What brings you to the Gathering Hall?

339
00:30:56,672 --> 00:30:58,797
I have a message for the mayor.

340
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,505
Very good.

341
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,547
Right this way, if you please.

342
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,005
These pictures
are of all the mayors of Ember.

343
00:31:15,422 --> 00:31:17,339
I'm related to him.

344
00:31:17,422 --> 00:31:20,047
He was my great-great-

345
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:23,505
I don't know how many "greats"-
grandfather.

346
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:27,422
"Podd Morethwart,
Seventh Mayor of Ember. "

347
00:31:28,505 --> 00:31:31,005
We still live in the same place he did.

348
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:34,047
Mmm.

349
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,797
<i>Come in.</i>

350
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:01,839
I recognize you
from Assignment Day, don't I?

351
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:05,630
She's a direct descendant
of our seventh mayor.

352
00:32:05,714 --> 00:32:08,880
Are you? How nice. Name?

353
00:32:08,964 --> 00:32:12,839
- Lina Mayfleet.
- "Mayfleet"?

354
00:32:12,922 --> 00:32:17,339
<i>That is a name for a Messenger.</i>

355
00:32:19,964 --> 00:32:22,922
May your feet be fleet.

356
00:32:29,255 --> 00:32:31,964
<i>Apparently,
you were born for the job.</i>

357
00:32:32,047 --> 00:32:34,047
What is your message for me,
Lina Mayfleet?

358
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,505
It's from Looper, sir.

359
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:39,089
Oh.

360
00:32:48,922 --> 00:32:51,130
"Your ship is in. "

361
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:55,672
Excellent.

362
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:04,172
What are those boxes
in the portraits, sir?

363
00:33:04,255 --> 00:33:07,130
<i>Is that part of the message?</i>

364
00:33:07,213 --> 00:33:09,797
No, I was just curious.

365
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,422
Thank you.

366
00:33:16,838 --> 00:33:20,380
<i>Attention. Sewage spill
in Apartment Block 14.</i>

367
00:33:20,422 --> 00:33:22,755
<i>Plumbers and Bucketmen, be advised.</i>

368
00:33:22,838 --> 00:33:26,797
I'm just looking after myself. You've heard
the rumors. You know what they're saying.

369
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,547
- It's going black for good.
- What's going black for good?

370
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,838
Clean your ears, Little Miss Nosy.

371
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:33,838
I said "back. "

372
00:33:33,922 --> 00:33:35,838
<i>Going back for good.</i>

373
00:33:38,213 --> 00:33:40,130
Did you deliver the message?

374
00:33:42,463 --> 00:33:44,547
Ember's been here a long time.

375
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,838
Blackouts or no blackouts...

376
00:33:47,922 --> 00:33:49,838
the Generator hasn't failed us yet.

377
00:33:49,922 --> 00:33:52,047
The Generator won't last.

378
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,088
It's falling apart.

379
00:33:54,172 --> 00:33:56,338
And no one knows
what they're doing down there.

380
00:33:56,422 --> 00:33:58,880
Something's really wrong.

381
00:33:58,963 --> 00:34:00,963
What can you do about it?

382
00:34:01,047 --> 00:34:02,963
Hmm?

383
00:34:04,297 --> 00:34:07,213
<i>What can you do about it?</i>

384
00:34:18,547 --> 00:34:21,588
How do you explain
that this used to be so small?

385
00:34:26,088 --> 00:34:28,505
You're gonna
give yourself a headache.

386
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,338
"Ember. "

387
00:35:02,213 --> 00:35:03,922
"Time. "

388
00:35:06,713 --> 00:35:09,380
"Support life. "

389
00:35:15,088 --> 00:35:17,088
"One: Proceed. "

390
00:35:17,172 --> 00:35:19,880
"Two: R-Release. "

391
00:35:42,047 --> 00:35:44,088
It's so shiny.

392
00:35:44,172 --> 00:35:47,797
What do you think it is?

393
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,047
<i>I need 20 packages of light bulbs.</i>

394
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,005
<i>My shop's outta peas.
I need 15 airtights.</i>

395
00:35:53,088 --> 00:35:55,963
Well, ya can't have 15.
You can only have three.

396
00:35:56,047 --> 00:35:59,297
<i>Don't give me that. Just yesterday I saw
plenty airtights in Pott Street Market.</i>

397
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,455
Well, that's why there aren't
so many today, isn't it?

398
00:36:01,456 --> 00:36:02,456
Don't be smart with me.

399
00:36:02,538 --> 00:36:04,880
What do you want me to do?
Make peas out of thin air?

400
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:07,213
- Next!
- I need help right now, please!

401
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:18,838
- Did-Did we find it?
- Lie back, Roo.

402
00:36:18,921 --> 00:36:20,963
- Did we-
- You need to stay in bed today.

403
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:23,671
We found it, Granny.

404
00:36:23,755 --> 00:36:25,671
Found it.

405
00:36:27,005 --> 00:36:29,088
Granny, what is it?

406
00:36:29,171 --> 00:36:31,088
Can you tell me?

407
00:36:31,171 --> 00:36:33,630
<i>- Don't ask her to talk now.
- Found it.</i>

408
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:36,046
What's best for you is to sleep.

409
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:40,088
<i>Isn't there any medicine you can give her?</i>

410
00:36:40,171 --> 00:36:42,505
I'm low on medicine. I'm sorry.

411
00:36:44,088 --> 00:36:46,963
Give her as much water
as she'll drink, eh?

412
00:36:48,921 --> 00:36:51,213
Can you look at Poppy too?

413
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:53,255
Hang onto her.

414
00:36:57,005 --> 00:36:58,588
I'm just gonna look in your mouth.

415
00:36:58,671 --> 00:37:01,171
Don't bite.

416
00:37:02,255 --> 00:37:05,755
Well, what was that doing there?

417
00:37:19,046 --> 00:37:22,463
Poppy. Poppy, stop.

418
00:37:24,921 --> 00:37:28,213
Poppy, stand still. Don't move.

419
00:37:31,046 --> 00:37:33,713
Okay. Okay, I've got you.

420
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,338
Granny, we're coming.

421
00:37:42,713 --> 00:37:44,630
<i>Granny?</i>

422
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:07,338
<i>You and Poppy have to share,
but I think the bed's big enough.</i>

423
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:12,838
<i>Poppy, let's make some dinner
and let your sister get settled.</i>

424
00:38:22,713 --> 00:38:25,630
<i>Do you know your part?</i>

425
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,088
Um-

426
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,171
I- I think I remember it pretty well
from last year.

427
00:38:33,255 --> 00:38:37,338
Oh, the Great Day of Singing
is so important.

428
00:38:37,421 --> 00:38:40,880
Oh, it lifts all of our hearts.
How lucky we are.

429
00:38:42,588 --> 00:38:45,421
I don't feel very lucky lately.

430
00:38:45,505 --> 00:38:49,630
- There's nothing to worry about.
- The blackouts worry everybody.

431
00:38:49,713 --> 00:38:52,421
Help is coming.

432
00:38:52,505 --> 00:38:54,421
- Help?
- Mm-hmm.

433
00:38:54,505 --> 00:38:56,630
Who built our city, dear?

434
00:38:56,713 --> 00:38:59,505
- The... Builders?
- That's right.

435
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:03,213
And the Builders will come again
and show us the way.

436
00:39:14,421 --> 00:39:17,963
Whatever it is, Granny,
I'll figure it out.

437
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,546
I promise.

438
00:39:39,255 --> 00:39:42,546
<i>- It says "Pipeworks. "
- That's why I brought it to you.</i>

439
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,005
This printing-

440
00:39:45,088 --> 00:39:47,546
You know what it reminds me of?

441
00:39:47,629 --> 00:39:49,963
Come on.
I gotta show you something.

442
00:39:55,754 --> 00:39:57,796
What are we doing here?

443
00:39:57,879 --> 00:40:00,796
The Builders left us this book.
We learned about it in History.

444
00:40:12,921 --> 00:40:14,879
Go on. Open it up.

445
00:40:16,629 --> 00:40:19,296
N- No one but the mayor's supposed to.

446
00:40:31,254 --> 00:40:33,296
The Builders wrote these instructions.

447
00:40:33,379 --> 00:40:35,588
It's exactly the same.

448
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,671
Come on.

449
00:41:07,754 --> 00:41:10,129
There's something I have to show you.

450
00:41:11,713 --> 00:41:14,838
- Wow.
- What do you think?

451
00:41:14,921 --> 00:41:18,046
- I think it's instructions.
- Yeah?

452
00:41:18,088 --> 00:41:21,254
What I don't understand is,
why would they have it in a circle?

453
00:41:21,338 --> 00:41:23,338
- I mean, I know it must be important.
- Add a "T."

454
00:41:23,421 --> 00:41:25,338
- What?
- Add a "T."

455
00:41:25,421 --> 00:41:28,171
E- X-I-T. Exit.

456
00:41:28,254 --> 00:41:30,671
What if there's an exit from Ember?

457
00:41:37,879 --> 00:41:40,754
I don't think
we're supposed to be down here.

458
00:41:40,838 --> 00:41:44,046
<i>This tunnel was erased from Sul's map.</i>

459
00:41:44,088 --> 00:41:46,171
<i>It dead-ends in a locked room.</i>

460
00:41:49,129 --> 00:41:51,254
This could be it.

461
00:42:01,254 --> 00:42:04,421
<i>- That was just the last time.
- Come on.</i>

462
00:42:04,504 --> 00:42:06,463
<i>- The time before that I-
- Shh.</i>

463
00:42:07,713 --> 00:42:10,129
<i>You're gonna get us caught.</i>

464
00:42:10,213 --> 00:42:12,129
Come on.

465
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:30,713
What was that?

466
00:42:31,879 --> 00:42:33,838
I have no idea.

467
00:43:17,462 --> 00:43:19,212
Run.

468
00:43:22,129 --> 00:43:24,004
Lina! Up here!

469
00:43:24,087 --> 00:43:27,879
<i>Go, go, go, go, go! Quickly, quickly!</i>

470
00:43:31,004 --> 00:43:33,129
Hurry! Get the box!

471
00:43:35,504 --> 00:43:38,087
Run!

472
00:44:20,129 --> 00:44:22,504
Hey!

473
00:44:22,587 --> 00:44:25,004
<i>Over here!</i>

474
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:36,462
Lina! Lina! He's stuck! Jump!

475
00:44:46,504 --> 00:44:48,754
Thanks for another great idea.

476
00:44:48,837 --> 00:44:51,046
Moles need to eat all the time
just to stay alive.

477
00:44:51,129 --> 00:44:53,421
Probably just as hungry as we are.

478
00:44:59,879 --> 00:45:02,671
Did you see those storerooms?
They're completely empty.

479
00:45:02,754 --> 00:45:04,712
We're gonna run out of food.

480
00:45:08,421 --> 00:45:11,587
It doesn't matter anyway.
The Generator won't last.

481
00:45:11,671 --> 00:45:14,546
<i>And pretty soon
it'll be black for good.</i>

482
00:45:18,796 --> 00:45:23,046
"Mayfleet. " That's my name.

483
00:45:23,129 --> 00:45:25,462
The man who wore that helmet
before me drowned.

484
00:45:28,837 --> 00:45:31,671
Drowned?

485
00:45:33,254 --> 00:45:35,254
He worked here.

486
00:45:35,337 --> 00:45:38,504
There's no water
but the irrigation pipes.

487
00:45:39,921 --> 00:45:41,879
How could he have drowned?

488
00:45:42,962 --> 00:45:45,546
<i>I miss him so much.</i>

489
00:45:47,712 --> 00:45:50,712
Mom too.

490
00:45:50,796 --> 00:45:54,004
How am I ever gonna figure out
what this is all about?

491
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:56,296
It's all these zeros.

492
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:58,796
That's what scares me the most.

493
00:45:59,879 --> 00:46:02,129
What would count down to nothing?

494
00:46:04,921 --> 00:46:07,421
- It sounds like doomsday.
- Oh, shh.

495
00:46:07,504 --> 00:46:09,587
Please, honey.

496
00:46:09,671 --> 00:46:12,671
Don't do anything foolish.

497
00:46:12,754 --> 00:46:14,754
I couldn't bear to lose you too.

498
00:46:14,837 --> 00:46:16,962
How did he die, Clary?

499
00:46:17,046 --> 00:46:18,962
Oh.

500
00:46:20,046 --> 00:46:21,962
Did he really drown?

501
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:39,504
Your father thought
it was doomsday too.

502
00:46:39,587 --> 00:46:42,546
<i>He believed there was a way
to get out of Ember.</i>

503
00:46:42,629 --> 00:46:45,421
<i>I couldn't dissuade him.</i>

504
00:46:45,504 --> 00:46:49,879
<i>I said it was our duty to stay here
and fix our problems...</i>

505
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,545
that it's illegal to venture out
into the Unknown.

506
00:46:52,629 --> 00:46:54,337
Why is it illegal?

507
00:47:00,087 --> 00:47:04,295
Your father said,
"The river runs in one direction...

508
00:47:04,379 --> 00:47:09,462
<i>so it must come from someplace
and go to someplace. "</i>

509
00:47:09,545 --> 00:47:14,045
<i>But he must've hit it too early
or something. I- I don't know.</i>

510
00:47:14,129 --> 00:47:17,504
<i>The tunnel flooded, and-</i>

511
00:47:17,587 --> 00:47:21,254
<i>And my dad died.</i>

512
00:47:25,045 --> 00:47:27,629
He was by himself?

513
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:31,337
Everyone else got out
before it collapsed.

514
00:47:37,295 --> 00:47:41,587
I was- I was considering
taking the box to the mayor.

515
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:44,045
<i>Yes! Do that.</i>

516
00:47:44,129 --> 00:47:46,504
Do that instead, please.

517
00:47:46,587 --> 00:47:49,212
Let him handle the situation.

518
00:47:54,337 --> 00:47:56,629
<i>These are trying and troubled times.</i>

519
00:47:56,712 --> 00:48:00,462
Our problems are grave.

520
00:48:02,295 --> 00:48:04,295
We need answers.

521
00:48:04,379 --> 00:48:06,629
<i>But beyond answers-</i>

522
00:48:06,712 --> 00:48:10,587
more important than answers-

523
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:13,045
we need solutions.

524
00:48:13,129 --> 00:48:15,045
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

525
00:48:15,129 --> 00:48:18,504
<i>And in order to find those solutions...</i>

526
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:25,212
I propose we launch
a thorough investigation.

527
00:48:25,295 --> 00:48:27,379
Yes. Yes.

528
00:48:27,462 --> 00:48:31,295
I hereby declare
the creation of a task force...

529
00:48:31,379 --> 00:48:33,337
to investigate the blackouts.

530
00:48:38,337 --> 00:48:41,087
<i>Do I have volunteers?</i>

531
00:48:44,879 --> 00:48:49,837
Today we, the people...

532
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,629
stand united against the darkness.

533
00:49:04,712 --> 00:49:06,504
My turn!

534
00:49:06,587 --> 00:49:09,045
Lizzie.

535
00:49:09,129 --> 00:49:10,879
Lizzie!

536
00:49:14,837 --> 00:49:17,837
<i>Hands off! Give me that!</i>

537
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,087
- Peaches!
- All right! Go away!

538
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:22,837
<i>Back off!</i>

539
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,337
What's "applesauce"?

540
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,462
<i>Hey, give me some!</i>

541
00:49:28,754 --> 00:49:30,594
Pineapple?

542
00:49:30,629 --> 00:49:32,504
- Give me that!
- Come on!

543
00:49:32,587 --> 00:49:36,420
No one's had pineapple since my grandmother
was a little girl. Where'd you get this?

544
00:49:36,504 --> 00:49:38,545
Give me that!

545
00:49:38,629 --> 00:49:41,087
Lizzie! Where'd you get that food?

546
00:49:43,295 --> 00:49:45,254
All right.

547
00:49:46,379 --> 00:49:49,170
I got it from my boyfriend.

548
00:49:49,254 --> 00:49:50,962
You don't have a boyfriend.

549
00:49:51,045 --> 00:49:54,212
It's not official, but there's this guy
who really likes me.

550
00:49:54,295 --> 00:49:58,045
He explores the storerooms,
especially the ones on the edges.

551
00:49:58,129 --> 00:50:00,962
They're marked empty in the ledger,
but they're not all empty.

552
00:50:01,045 --> 00:50:03,712
I'll give you a bite
if you promise not to tell.

553
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:08,095
It's wrong, Lizzie.

554
00:50:08,096 --> 00:50:09,800
Well, he says it's all gonna
be gone soon anyway.

555
00:50:09,879 --> 00:50:12,212
Why not live as well
as we can right now?

556
00:50:12,295 --> 00:50:14,295
There he is.

557
00:50:25,837 --> 00:50:27,878
Doon!

558
00:50:27,962 --> 00:50:29,962
<i>Have you-</i>

559
00:50:33,128 --> 00:50:35,045
<i>Doon!</i>

560
00:50:40,045 --> 00:50:41,962
I need to tell you something.

561
00:50:42,045 --> 00:50:44,962
<i>It was Looper we saw
near that 351 door.</i>

562
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:47,503
Before that, I took a message
to the mayor for him.

563
00:50:50,295 --> 00:50:53,295
<i>I'll bet there's something big
on the other side of that door.</i>

564
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:16,170
<i>There's so much food.</i>

565
00:51:48,003 --> 00:51:49,920
Go.

566
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,003
And I thought he was lying
when he talked about finding a solution.

567
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:05,003
He wasn't lying.

568
00:52:05,087 --> 00:52:07,212
He's found his solution.

569
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:09,628
Poppy. Lie down, okay?

570
00:52:09,712 --> 00:52:11,753
It's time to go to sleep.

571
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:14,545
Could you just pump those pedals?

572
00:52:14,628 --> 00:52:16,837
What is this?

573
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,503
It's the answering machine tape
from my parents' phone.

574
00:52:20,587 --> 00:52:22,628
When we still had one.

575
00:52:22,712 --> 00:52:26,045
Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo!

576
00:52:26,128 --> 00:52:28,045
Anybody home?

577
00:52:28,128 --> 00:52:31,628
<i>Don't hold dinner for me, darling.</i>

578
00:52:31,712 --> 00:52:33,712
<i>- That's my dad's voice.
- I'll be there before lights out.</i>

579
00:52:35,628 --> 00:52:39,878
Raine, it's me, Barrow.
I've been thinkin' about it.

580
00:52:39,962 --> 00:52:44,212
I watch my boy,
and... I've come around.

581
00:52:44,253 --> 00:52:47,837
I've changed my mind. I'm in.

582
00:52:48,962 --> 00:52:51,295
What's wrong?

583
00:52:55,128 --> 00:52:57,753
He lied to me.

584
00:52:57,837 --> 00:53:00,462
Where are you going?

585
00:53:00,545 --> 00:53:03,295
Well, meet me
at the Greenhouses, okay?

586
00:53:03,378 --> 00:53:05,795
<i>Good night, young man.</i>

587
00:53:05,878 --> 00:53:08,670
<i>How was your rehearsal?</i>

588
00:53:10,753 --> 00:53:13,212
For the Singing.

589
00:53:13,295 --> 00:53:16,753
Oh. I-It was fine.

590
00:53:16,837 --> 00:53:19,920
- It was really good.
- Good.

591
00:53:20,003 --> 00:53:23,003
<i>- Good night.
- Good night.</i>

592
00:53:25,712 --> 00:53:28,587
Dad. I heard you.

593
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,753
<i>I heard you on the answering-</i>

594
00:53:30,837 --> 00:53:34,712
Lina Mayfleet has her parents'
old answering machine tape.

595
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:37,587
I heard you.
You said her dad could count you in.

596
00:53:41,753 --> 00:53:44,462
You tried to leave the city, didn't you?

597
00:53:45,753 --> 00:53:48,253
W- Why would I do that?

598
00:53:48,336 --> 00:53:50,003
Because of me.

599
00:53:58,836 --> 00:54:00,711
Dad.

600
00:54:00,795 --> 00:54:02,711
<i>Please.</i>

601
00:54:05,336 --> 00:54:08,336
- We were wrong.
- No, you were right.

602
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,336
There is an exit.

603
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:13,628
Yeah. Raine thought so, too,
and it got him killed, Son.

604
00:54:13,711 --> 00:54:15,878
Dad, there's a way out
in the Pipeworks...

605
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,003
but you have to tell me
everything that you know.

606
00:54:18,086 --> 00:54:21,420
- Tell me what you know.
- I don't know anything, and neither do you.

607
00:54:23,086 --> 00:54:25,045
<i>The Builders left Instructions.</i>

608
00:54:25,086 --> 00:54:27,128
The Builders abandoned us.

609
00:54:27,211 --> 00:54:29,961
No, they didn't.
They didn't, Dad. I have proof.

610
00:54:33,586 --> 00:54:35,461
Show me.

611
00:54:51,711 --> 00:54:54,336
Wait!

612
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:57,336
Oh. Happy Great Day of Singing,
young lady.

613
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,211
I need to speak to you in private.

614
00:55:00,295 --> 00:55:02,545
Very well then.

615
00:55:02,628 --> 00:55:06,045
What I need to tell you is secret
and really important.

616
00:55:06,128 --> 00:55:07,595
- What is it?
- The mayor-

617
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:10,796
He's got a bunker in the Pipeworks.
It's filled with food.

618
00:55:13,211 --> 00:55:15,670
The shortages aren't as bad
as everyone thinks.

619
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,003
You mean the mayor is stealing?

620
00:55:21,086 --> 00:55:24,378
Looper, who works in the storerooms,
is helping him.

621
00:55:26,878 --> 00:55:28,836
Well, this is shocking.

622
00:55:30,045 --> 00:55:33,503
Shocking. I'm shocked.

623
00:55:35,628 --> 00:55:38,961
Um, we have to report this.

624
00:55:39,045 --> 00:55:40,961
Come with me.

625
00:55:41,045 --> 00:55:43,051
Well done, Lina Mayfleet.

626
00:55:43,086 --> 00:55:45,170
Once you arrest him, Doon and I
can show you where the room is -

627
00:55:45,253 --> 00:55:47,711
<i>Wait. Where are we going?</i>

628
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:12,545
I beg your pardon, Your Honor.

629
00:56:12,628 --> 00:56:16,170
<i>You remember Lina Mayfleet?</i>

630
00:56:16,253 --> 00:56:18,295
She wants to accuse you.

631
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:22,461
Accuse me of what?

632
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,711
Of stealing food
from the people of Ember.

633
00:56:26,878 --> 00:56:30,753
I love my city and everyone in it.

634
00:56:36,295 --> 00:56:38,295
And I would never think
to do such a thing.

635
00:56:38,378 --> 00:56:40,503
We saw your room!
We saw you in it!

636
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:45,420
- "We"?
- She and her friend, Doon Harrow.

637
00:56:49,128 --> 00:56:52,045
What's that box?

638
00:56:52,128 --> 00:56:54,045
<i>Hmm.</i>

639
00:56:54,128 --> 00:56:56,045
It's mine.

640
00:56:57,503 --> 00:57:00,211
It's unusual looking.

641
00:57:00,295 --> 00:57:03,545
Where'd you get that?

642
00:57:07,586 --> 00:57:10,003
You're related to one of the mayors.

643
00:57:10,086 --> 00:57:12,545
Yes. Uh, he was the seventh mayor.

644
00:57:19,419 --> 00:57:22,628
A lot of things got lost
when the seventh mayor passed.

645
00:57:23,628 --> 00:57:25,628
May I look at that box, Lina?

646
00:57:25,711 --> 00:57:29,628
- Why?
- What's inside the box, Lina?

647
00:57:29,711 --> 00:57:33,836
I imagine it's official
mayor-related business.

648
00:57:35,128 --> 00:57:37,669
<i>Box. Give it to me.</i>

649
00:57:37,753 --> 00:57:40,253
- It's not yours.
- Give me the box!

650
00:57:40,336 --> 00:57:42,878
- No!
- Get it from her. Now.

651
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:45,919
<i>Take it from her! Move!</i>

652
00:57:46,003 --> 00:57:48,294
<i>Grab her!</i>

653
00:57:48,378 --> 00:57:51,919
<i>Have you got her?</i>

654
00:58:11,169 --> 00:58:12,836
Get her.

655
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,461
Stop! After her!

656
00:58:47,419 --> 00:58:50,336
Is this the home of Doon Harrow?

657
00:58:50,419 --> 00:58:52,544
Is he here?

658
00:58:52,628 --> 00:58:56,461
I- I-I can't hear. I have a weak ear.
Y- You have to talk louder.

659
00:58:56,544 --> 00:58:59,044
- Doon Harrow!
- Doon Harro- No, Loris.

660
00:58:59,128 --> 00:59:02,211
We're looking for Doon Harrow.
He's charged with treason against the city.

661
00:59:02,294 --> 00:59:05,919
That's terrible.
If it's true, he's no son of mine!

662
00:59:06,003 --> 00:59:08,461
<i>Treason is the worst offense
anyone could possibly commit.</i>

663
00:59:08,544 --> 00:59:12,669
Builders were wise when they said,
"If you have proof, you have to pursue it!

664
00:59:12,711 --> 00:59:16,544
<i>There's more to a bottle cap than
keeping liquid from leaking out of glass!"</i>

665
00:59:16,628 --> 00:59:18,461
- Get him!
- Uh, we'll go this way.

666
00:59:18,544 --> 00:59:22,211
Doon! The guards are here!
You traitor!

667
00:59:22,253 --> 00:59:24,586
- In here. Follow him.
- They're comin' to get you!

668
00:59:25,711 --> 00:59:27,919
The keypad is somewhere.

669
00:59:28,003 --> 00:59:30,211
What's he doin'?

670
00:59:30,253 --> 00:59:32,253
<i>- Just one second.
- He's crazy.</i>

671
00:59:32,336 --> 00:59:35,044
<i>- Is this the way to your apartment?
- Apparently not.</i>

672
00:59:47,794 --> 00:59:51,003
<i>Upstairs!</i>

673
01:00:00,253 --> 01:00:02,169
- They're after me!
- Who?

674
01:00:02,253 --> 01:00:04,169
- Guards!
- Why?

675
01:00:04,253 --> 01:00:06,294
<i>Doon and I, we- Quick.</i>

676
01:00:06,378 --> 01:00:09,419
<i>What is this all about?
We'll be late for the Great Day of Singing.</i>

677
01:00:09,503 --> 01:00:11,419
Well, excuse me, ma'am.

678
01:00:11,503 --> 01:00:13,628
I'm- I'm looking for Lina Mayfleet.

679
01:00:13,711 --> 01:00:15,961
Well, she's not here. She's probably
already in Harken Square.

680
01:00:16,044 --> 01:00:17,711
Okay, okay. Well, I guess
I'll just have a look for myself.

681
01:00:17,746 --> 01:00:19,419
Oh! Excuse me.

682
01:00:19,503 --> 01:00:22,211
Beg your pardon! So sorry.

683
01:00:25,294 --> 01:00:29,711
<i>You know, the mayor did
ask for her specifically.</i>

684
01:00:29,753 --> 01:00:32,961
The Greenhouse. Uh, she was meeting
a friend at the Greenhouse.

685
01:00:33,044 --> 01:00:34,961
<i>Does that help?</i>

686
01:01:04,336 --> 01:01:07,127
Careful!
That's food you're destroying!

687
01:01:07,211 --> 01:01:09,586
Our food!

688
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,377
<i>Psst!</i>

689
01:01:38,211 --> 01:01:40,127
A warning:

690
01:01:40,211 --> 01:01:43,877
If I discover you were helping, harboring
or otherwise assisting those kids-

691
01:01:43,961 --> 01:01:45,961
Why would I do that?

692
01:01:49,586 --> 01:01:52,044
I have information
they were coming this way.

693
01:01:52,127 --> 01:01:54,127
Who provided you
with that information?

694
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,627
That's confidential.

695
01:01:56,711 --> 01:02:01,169
All I need for you to understand is this:
If you're involved, you'll regret it.

696
01:02:02,877 --> 01:02:05,961
<i>Anything you hear, anything you see...</i>

697
01:02:06,044 --> 01:02:08,044
you tell me.

698
01:02:09,461 --> 01:02:11,419
Otherwise,
there will be consequences.

699
01:02:11,502 --> 01:02:16,211
Should anything happen in the future
that you hear of or see...

700
01:02:16,294 --> 01:02:18,211
<i>I'll expect to be informed.</i>

701
01:02:19,961 --> 01:02:21,961
I don't need to tell you
that I have the mayor's ear.

702
01:02:33,002 --> 01:02:35,002
<i>Hmm.</i>

703
01:03:01,669 --> 01:03:03,586
Okay.

704
01:03:03,669 --> 01:03:06,711
Leave two guards behind!

705
01:03:06,794 --> 01:03:09,336
We've gotta find a way out of here.

706
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:11,294
Now.

707
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:20,669
What is this?

708
01:03:29,836 --> 01:03:32,044
My dad made this.

709
01:03:35,002 --> 01:03:37,002
It doesn't look very safe.

710
01:03:37,086 --> 01:03:39,544
That's my dad.

711
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:45,544
Everything he makes looks like this.

712
01:03:45,627 --> 01:03:47,961
What do you mean, your dad?

713
01:03:48,044 --> 01:03:51,627
Barrow. His voice is on
your answering machine.

714
01:03:51,711 --> 01:03:54,461
But your dad's name is Loris.

715
01:03:54,544 --> 01:03:57,961
Barrow Harrow. It's his nickname.

716
01:03:58,044 --> 01:04:00,877
- After some wheelbarrow he used to push around.
- You're the boy!

717
01:04:02,336 --> 01:04:05,002
That means our parents
were trying to escape together.

718
01:04:06,127 --> 01:04:08,627
They were trying.

719
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:12,419
We're running out of time.
They'll come back for us.

720
01:04:29,335 --> 01:04:31,252
Pedal!

721
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:38,294
Now, you stay here and be a good girl.

722
01:04:38,377 --> 01:04:40,585
Okay? And look for me up there.

723
01:04:40,669 --> 01:04:43,794
- Where's Lina?
- Oh, I'm- She's here somewhere.

724
01:04:48,544 --> 01:04:51,377
- Can you see anything?
- Barely.

725
01:05:03,877 --> 01:05:06,835
Here it is again-
the moment in the year...

726
01:05:06,877 --> 01:05:10,502
when we pause to celebrate
our fair city.

727
01:05:10,585 --> 01:05:12,919
This beacon of light...

728
01:05:13,002 --> 01:05:14,794
in a world of darkness.

729
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:18,127
Hold on!

730
01:05:32,544 --> 01:05:34,460
Okay. That stuff- Cover it.

731
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:41,585
This miracle of planning...

732
01:05:41,669 --> 01:05:44,710
<i>this magnificent achievement...</i>

733
01:05:44,794 --> 01:05:49,002
that is our city of Ember.

734
01:05:57,585 --> 01:06:00,169
* This is all we know *

735
01:06:00,252 --> 01:06:02,960
* Ember is forever *

736
01:06:03,044 --> 01:06:05,669
* When the light comes on *

737
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:08,919
* I will be with you *

738
01:06:09,127 --> 01:06:11,794
* When the light comes on *

739
01:06:11,877 --> 01:06:14,835
* Hope is everlasting *

740
01:06:14,877 --> 01:06:16,585
They started singing.

741
01:06:16,669 --> 01:06:21,710
<i>* The morning light
Spend some time with you *</i>

742
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:28,502
Oh, I've gotta show you.
The mayor had one too.

743
01:06:29,835 --> 01:06:33,335
- He gave this to you?
- Not exactly.

744
01:06:47,794 --> 01:06:49,710
The Generator.

745
01:06:49,794 --> 01:06:52,502
Okay. We have to get there.

746
01:06:52,585 --> 01:06:54,794
We have to get there now.

747
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:56,794
Come on.

748
01:06:56,877 --> 01:06:59,210
Wait! Poppy.

749
01:06:59,294 --> 01:07:03,544
* I will be with you *

750
01:07:03,627 --> 01:07:05,835
* This is all we know *

751
01:07:05,877 --> 01:07:08,960
<i>* Ember is forever *</i>

752
01:07:09,044 --> 01:07:11,377
<i>- * When the light comes on *

753
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:14,627

754
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:17,627

01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:20,960

759
01:07:30,585 --> 01:07:34,294
* Hope is everlasting **

760
01:07:51,293 --> 01:07:53,668
That's it.

761
01:08:00,168 --> 01:08:02,668
Poppy.

762
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:05,210
<i>Maybe he knows.</i>

763
01:08:05,293 --> 01:08:07,668
Sul. Sul.

764
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:09,877
Okay, we have to get him on his feet.

765
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:14,168
Wake up. Sul, is there a key
to the Generator door?

766
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:16,168
Sure, there's a key.

767
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:18,668
Great. Where is it?

768
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:21,293
How should I know?
It's not my job.

769
01:08:31,168 --> 01:08:33,585
<i>Wait.</i>

770
01:08:34,835 --> 01:08:36,877
Something's not right.

771
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,252
The Builders were smart.
They would have made it simple.

772
01:08:40,335 --> 01:08:42,585
I wouldn't call any of this simple.

773
01:08:44,752 --> 01:08:47,127
They would have thought it through.

774
01:08:49,043 --> 01:08:51,002
They planned...

775
01:08:58,877 --> 01:09:00,793
everything.

776
01:09:08,877 --> 01:09:10,793
Doon.

777
01:09:15,668 --> 01:09:18,127
There's something behind those lockers.

778
01:09:20,585 --> 01:09:23,002
Poppy, come on. Let's go. Quick.

779
01:09:27,418 --> 01:09:29,710
There's gotta be a way in.

780
01:10:04,752 --> 01:10:07,168
What... are these for?

781
01:10:09,335 --> 01:10:11,668
"Bo-at. "

782
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:13,710
"Boat. "

783
01:10:18,877 --> 01:10:21,335
Okay. "Release by"-

784
01:10:21,377 --> 01:10:23,002
<i>- "Rotating"-
- Something.</i>

785
01:10:23,043 --> 01:10:24,877
<i>- "Mechanism clockwise. "
- "Clockwise. "</i>

786
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:30,877
It's that. It has to be.

787
01:10:30,918 --> 01:10:33,585
Okay.

788
01:10:57,668 --> 01:11:00,127
Poppy!

789
01:11:11,043 --> 01:11:13,043
There's more coming.

790
01:11:15,335 --> 01:11:17,585
There's another one. Look.

791
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:48,001
<i>The water level is too low!
It's gonna hit.</i>

792
01:12:50,793 --> 01:12:53,585
It should have moved out of the way.

793
01:12:53,668 --> 01:12:56,918
We're not supposed to skip ahead.

794
01:12:57,001 --> 01:13:01,001
- We need to follow the Instructions exactly.
- Okay.

795
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:03,085
It's what the Builders
would have wanted.

796
01:13:03,168 --> 01:13:05,085
- Okay. Come on.
- Okay. Um-

797
01:13:05,168 --> 01:13:08,085
<i>"Access"-
Something, something.</i>

798
01:13:08,168 --> 01:13:10,710
- "1 room. "
- 1 room.

799
01:13:10,793 --> 01:13:13,168
Room-

800
01:13:19,043 --> 01:13:22,335
<i>Come on, Poppy.
Come on. Move it.</i>

801
01:13:31,543 --> 01:13:33,835
It wasn't "1 room"
we were looking for.

802
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:37,543
It was "L."
"Emergency Control Room. "

803
01:13:39,043 --> 01:13:41,501
Okay.

804
01:13:41,585 --> 01:13:43,918
The cards. Let's try the cards.

805
01:13:44,001 --> 01:13:45,918
Okay.

806
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:00,668
Oh, come on!

807
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:02,793
<i>Come on!</i>

808
01:14:08,501 --> 01:14:10,418
Nice work, Poppy.

809
01:14:11,668 --> 01:14:13,543
Okay.

810
01:14:42,543 --> 01:14:45,001
Are you okay?

811
01:15:31,459 --> 01:15:33,918
The cards. Get the cards.

812
01:15:43,709 --> 01:15:47,501
"Set waterwheel 1 to full thrust. "

813
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:50,501
Waterwheel 1. Full thrust.

814
01:15:57,459 --> 01:16:01,376
<i>Okay. It's moving.
Okay. What's next?</i>

815
01:16:01,459 --> 01:16:03,709
Um, "Set waterwheel 2 to full stop. "

816
01:16:03,793 --> 01:16:06,334
Waterwheel 2. Full stop.

817
01:16:23,876 --> 01:16:25,584
It's stuck.

818
01:16:43,668 --> 01:16:45,459
Sul.

819
01:16:46,709 --> 01:16:48,668
<i>Sul!</i>

820
01:16:50,459 --> 01:16:52,376
Stay here.

821
01:17:00,334 --> 01:17:02,251
<i>Sul! Sul!</i>

822
01:17:02,334 --> 01:17:05,043
Go away, boy! Go away!

823
01:17:05,126 --> 01:17:07,293
Sul, what are you doing up here?

824
01:17:07,376 --> 01:17:10,876
This thing is jammed stuck!
I've gotta free it.

825
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:13,126
How do you know
that's what you should do?

826
01:17:16,959 --> 01:17:19,376
It's my job!

827
01:17:20,501 --> 01:17:23,501
Aah! Nothing's working.

828
01:17:23,543 --> 01:17:25,584
Try this!

829
01:17:33,418 --> 01:17:35,418
It's beginning to move!

830
01:17:36,459 --> 01:17:38,793
It's moving!

831
01:17:40,876 --> 01:17:43,459
- It's working, Sul!
- It's working!

832
01:17:43,543 --> 01:17:46,918
Sul, this is the exit!
It's the way out of Ember!

833
01:17:47,001 --> 01:17:49,751
- To where, boy?
- We'll find out!

834
01:18:16,542 --> 01:18:19,042
* The Builders have always known *

835
01:18:19,126 --> 01:18:25,084
* But you and you and you **

836
01:18:39,459 --> 01:18:42,667
Hold on!

837
01:18:45,876 --> 01:18:47,917
Doon!

838
01:18:48,001 --> 01:18:50,667
<i>Let's go. Come on.</i>

839
01:18:58,459 --> 01:19:01,001
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

840
01:19:05,376 --> 01:19:09,792
<i>* About you and you *</i>

841
01:19:09,876 --> 01:19:12,792
* And you **

842
01:19:35,876 --> 01:19:38,751
Poppy!

843
01:19:40,001 --> 01:19:42,959
Sul, come on! Now!
We've gotta go now! Come on!

844
01:19:43,042 --> 01:19:46,542
- I've got to keep this open!
- Sul, come now! Come with me!

845
01:19:46,626 --> 01:19:49,501
You go! Now!

846
01:19:52,042 --> 01:19:53,876
It's all right!

847
01:20:03,417 --> 01:20:05,459
Are you okay?

848
01:20:05,542 --> 01:20:09,042
- Okay. Get in!
- Did you see what happened to the first one?

849
01:20:09,126 --> 01:20:11,709
<i>We don't have any choice. Come on!</i>

850
01:20:20,292 --> 01:20:22,209
Hold on, Poppy.

851
01:20:31,209 --> 01:20:33,167
<i>It's lowering.</i>

852
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:24,876
<i>Mayor Cole?</i>

853
01:21:26,459 --> 01:21:29,209
I made it.

854
01:21:29,251 --> 01:21:32,959
What are you doing?
You can't leave me here!

855
01:21:33,042 --> 01:21:35,834
Wait!

856
01:21:46,375 --> 01:21:48,292
No. No!

857
01:21:49,875 --> 01:21:52,792
We had a deal. Wait. Wait!

858
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:57,959
It was you and me!
Open the door!

859
01:21:58,042 --> 01:22:01,084
<i>We had a deal! We had a deal!</i>

860
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:04,750
<i>Open the door! Open the door.</i>

861
01:22:04,834 --> 01:22:06,750
<i>Not fair!</i>

862
01:22:06,834 --> 01:22:08,834
<i>You said!</i>

863
01:22:33,542 --> 01:22:36,334
<i>Doon, to the right! The right!</i>

864
01:22:36,375 --> 01:22:38,292
I'm trying!

865
01:23:13,125 --> 01:23:15,125
<i>- Drop!
- Hold on!</i>

866
01:25:00,667 --> 01:25:03,167
There's something up ahead.

867
01:25:12,542 --> 01:25:14,500
Okay.

868
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:37,208
They were right.

869
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:39,625
There's nothing but darkness.

870
01:27:33,208 --> 01:27:35,125
Lina.

871
01:27:58,042 --> 01:28:00,083
It's blue.

872
01:28:12,333 --> 01:28:15,458
<i>Ember! You can see it!</i>

873
01:28:15,542 --> 01:28:17,583
Hello!

874
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:21,083
They won't hear you.
It's way too far.

875
01:28:21,167 --> 01:28:23,458
Well-Well, we've gotta
tell them somehow.

876
01:28:23,542 --> 01:28:25,792
We need to tell them what's up here.

877
01:28:27,333 --> 01:28:31,458
<i>Lina and Doon
tied their hope to a rock...</i>

878
01:28:31,542 --> 01:28:34,167
<i>and tossed it down toward the city.</i>

879
01:28:42,417 --> 01:28:45,500
<i>The rock could've ended up on a roof.</i>

880
01:28:48,208 --> 01:28:50,166
<i>Or kicked into a gutter.</i>

881
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:54,833
<i>But fate ran another course.</i>

882
01:28:57,291 --> 01:29:00,083
<i>And the message found its way.</i>

883
01:29:08,666 --> 01:29:11,250
<i>Now the path was clear for all.</i>

884
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:17,458
<i>All of us who kept
the flame of Ember burning...</i>

885
01:29:17,541 --> 01:29:19,875
<i>through the darkness...</i>

886
01:29:19,958 --> 01:29:22,958
<i>so that we could live again
on the earth...</i>

887
01:29:23,041 --> 01:29:25,583
<i>in the air and the light.</i>
