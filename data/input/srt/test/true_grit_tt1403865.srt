1
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,987
People do not give it credence
that a young girl could leave home

2
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:24,115
and go off in the wintertime
to avenge her father's blood.

3
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,495
But it did happen.

4
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:30,166
I was just 14 years of age when
a coward by the name of Tom Chaney

5
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,835
shot my father down

6
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,379
and robbed him of his life and his horse

7
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:38,345
and two California gold pieces
that he carried in his trouser band.

8
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,177
Chaney was a hired man

9
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,266
and Papa had taken him up to Fort Smith

10
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,516
to help lead back a string
of Mustang ponies he'd bought.

11
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:51,024
In town, Chaney had
fallen to drink and cards

12
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,352
and lost all his money.

13
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,188
He got it into his head
he was being cheated

14
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:59,533
and went back to the boarding
house for his Henry rifle.

15
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:03,495
When Papa tried to
intervene, Chaney shot him.

16
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,873
Chaney fled.

17
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,378
He could have walked his horse,

18
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:16,216
for not a soul in that city
could be bothered to give chase.

19
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,804
No doubt Chaney fancied
himself scot-free.

20
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,387
But he was wrong.

21
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:28,220
You must pay for everything in
this world, one way and another.

22
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,895
There is nothing free,
except the grace of God.

23
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,545
All right!

24
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,776
Is that the man?

25
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:25,868
That is my father.

26
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:30,120
If you would like to kiss
him, it would be all right.

27
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,410
He's gone home. Praise the Lord.

28
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,708
Why is it so much?

29
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:39,045
The quality of the cask
et and of the embalming.

30
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,590
The lifelike appearance
requires time and art.

31
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,594
And the chemicals come dear.
The particulars are in your bill.

32
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,644
If you'd like to kiss
him, it would be all right.

33
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,688
Thank you. The spirit has flown.

34
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,561
Your wire said $50.

35
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,484
You did not specify that
he was to be shipped.

36
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:02,030
Well, $60 is every cent we have.
It leaves nothing for our board.

37
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,699
Yarnell, you can see to the body's
transport to the train station

38
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,993
and accompany it home. I will
have to sleep here tonight.

39
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,696
I still have to collect father's
things and see to some other business.

40
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,328
Your mama didn't say nothing about
you seeing to no business here.

41
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,790
It is business Mama doesn't know about.
It's all right, Yarnell. I dismiss you.

42
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,042
- I'm not sure...
- Tell Mama not to sign anything

43
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:21,250
until I return home and see that
Papa is buried in his Mason's apron.

44
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,716
Your terms are agreeable if
I may pass the night here.

45
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,967
Here? Among these people?

46
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,554
These people?

47
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,476
I'm expecting three more souls.

48
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,813
Sullivan, Smith,

49
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,391
and H is Tongue In The Rain.

50
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:41,570
Ladies and gentlemen, beware
and train up your children

51
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,146
in the way that they should go.

52
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:47,363
You see what has become
of me because of drink.

53
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:53,249
I killed a man in a trifling
quarrel over a pocket-knife.

54
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,869
If I had have received good
instruction as a child...

55
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,251
- Can you point out the sheriff?
- Him with the mustaches.

56
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:03,129
...I would be with my
wife and children today.

57
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,336
I do not know what is to become of them.

58
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:10,257
But I hope and pray that
you will not slight them

59
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,145
and compel them to go into low company.

60
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,022
Stop whimpering, boy!

61
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:28,321
Well, I killed the wrong man
is the which-of-why I'm here.

62
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:33,113
Had I killed the man I meant to, I
don't believe I'd have been convicted.

63
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,499
I see men out there in
that crowd is worse than me.

64
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,163
Okay.

65
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,839
Before I am hanged,
I would like to say...

66
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,481
No, we ain't arrested him.

67
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,527
Ain't caught up to him. He
lit out for the Territory.

68
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,022
I would think that he's throwed
in with Lucky Ned Pepper,

69
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:10,530
whose gang robbed a mail hack
yesterday on the Poteau River.

70
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,618
Why are you not looking for him?

71
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,697
I have no authority
in the Indian Nation.

72
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,874
Tom Chaney is the business
of the U.S. Marshals now.

73
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,205
- When will they arrest him?
- Not soon, I'm afraid.

74
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:23,380
The marshals are not well
staffed, and I'll tell you frankly,

75
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,134
Chaney is at the end of a long
list of fugitives and malefactors.

76
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,428
Could I hire a marshal
to pursue Tom Chaney?

77
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,465
You have a lot of experience
with bounty hunters, do you?

78
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,305
That is a silly question. I am
here to settle my father's affairs.

79
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,887
- All alone?
- I am the person for it.

80
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,391
Mama was never any good at sums
and she could hardly spell "cat".

81
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,316
I intend to see Papa's killer hanged.

82
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:48,397
Well, nothing prevents you from offering
a reward and so informing the marshals.

83
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,903
It would have to be real
money, though, to be persuasive.

84
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,030
Chaney is across the river
in the Choctaw Nation.

85
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,453
I will see to the money.
Who's the best marshal?

86
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,330
I would have to weigh that.

87
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,534
William Waters is the best tracker.

88
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,213
He's half Comanche and it is
something to see him cut for sign.

89
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,756
The meanest is Rooster Cogburn.

90
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:11,170
He is a pitiless man, double tough,
and fear don't enter into his thinking.

91
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,255
He loves to pull a cork.

92
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,266
The best is probably L.T. Quinn.

93
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,348
He brings his prisoners in alive.

94
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,521
He may let one slip by now and again

95
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:25,851
but he believes that even the worst
of men is entitled to a fair shake.

96
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,270
Where can I find this Rooster?

97
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,694
The jakes is occupied.

98
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:35,619
I know it is occupied, Mr. Cogburn.
As I said, I have business with you.

99
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,700
I have prior business.

100
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,036
You have been at it for
quite some time, Mr. Cogburn.

101
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,543
There is no clock on my business!

102
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,542
To hell with you! How
did you stalk me here?

103
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,878
The sheriff told me
to look in the saloon.

104
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,802
In the saloon, they referred
me here. We must talk.

105
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,884
Women ain't allowed in the saloon.

106
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,217
I was not there as a
customer. I am 14 years old.

107
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,225
Well, the jakes is occupied.

108
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,811
Will be for some time.

109
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,815
Good evening.

110
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,584
If you would like to sleep in
a coffin, it would be all right.

111
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,194
How much are you paying for cotton?

112
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,575
Nine and a half for low
middling and ten for ordinary.

113
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,489
We got most of ours out early.

114
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,580
Sold it to the Woodson Brothers
in Little Rock for 11 cents.

115
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:06,790
Then I suggest you take the balance
of it to the Woodson Brothers.

116
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,129
We took the balance to Woodson.

117
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,920
We got ten and a half.

118
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,294
Why did you come here to tell me this?

119
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,513
I thought we might shop
around up here next year,

120
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,633
but I guess we're doing
all right in Little Rock.

121
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,976
I'm Mattie Ross.

122
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,937
Daughter of Frank Ross.

123
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,354
A tragic thing.

124
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:34,526
May I say your father impressed
me with his manly qualities.

125
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,615
He was a close trader but
he acted the gentleman.

126
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,198
Well, I propose to sell those ponies
back to you that my father bought.

127
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,946
That, I fear, is out of the question.

128
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,158
I will see that they're shipped
to you at my earliest convenience.

129
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,875
We don't want the ponies
now. We don't need 'em.

130
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,289
Well, that hardly concerns me.

131
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,336
Your father bought the
ponies and paid for them

132
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,173
and there is an end of it.
I have the bill of sale.

133
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:58,132
And I want $300 for Papa's saddle
horse that was stolen from your stable.

134
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,015
You'll have to take that up
with the man who stole the horse.

135
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,978
Tom Chaney stole the horse while it
was in your care. You are responsible.

136
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,722
I admire your sand

137
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,646
but I believe you will find
I'm not liable for such claims.

138
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,353
You were the custodian. If you
were a bank and were robbed,

139
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,697
you could not simply tell
the depositors to go hang.

140
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:22,195
I do not entertain hypotheticals.
The world as it is is vexing enough.

141
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:27,999
Secondly, your valuation of the horse
is high by about $200. How old are you?

142
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,293
If anything, my price is low.

143
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,995
Judy is a fine racing mare.

144
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,749
I've seen her jump an eight-rail
fence with a heavy rider. I'm 14.

145
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,342
Well, that's all very interesting.

146
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,509
The ponies are yours. Take them.

147
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,511
Your father's horse was
stolen by a murderous criminal.

148
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,309
I had provided reasonable
protection for the creature

149
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,228
as per our implicit agreement.

150
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,224
My watchman had his teeth knocked
out and can take only soup.

151
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,652
- I will take it to law.
- You have no case.

152
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,821
Lawyer J. Noble Daggett of Dardanelle,
Arkansas may think otherwise,

153
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,400
as might a jury, petitioned by
a widow and three small children.

154
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:09,579
I will pay $200 to your father's estate

155
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,997
when I have in my hand
a letter from your lawyer

156
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,501
absolving me of all liability from
the beginning of the world to date...

157
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,173
I will take $200 for Judy,

158
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,253
plus $ 100 for the ponies and $25 for
the gray horse that Tom Chaney left.

159
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,425
He was easily worth $40.

160
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,423
That is $325 total.

161
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,180
The ponies have no part
in it. I will not buy them.

162
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,387
Then the price for Judy is $325.

163
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,024
I would not pay $325
for a winged Pegasus!

164
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,602
As for the gray horse,
it does not belong to you.

165
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,029
The gray horse was lent
to Tom Chaney by my father.

166
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,276
Chaney only had the use of him.

167
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:47,620
I will pay $225 and keep the gray horse.

168
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,456
- I don't want the ponies.
- I cannot accept that.

169
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,205
There will be no settlement after I
leave this office. It will go to law.

170
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,287
All right, this is my last offer.

171
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,626
$250.

172
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,047
For that I get the release
previously discussed

173
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,378
and I keep your father's saddle.

174
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,384
The gray horse is not yours to sell.

175
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,807
The saddle is not for
sale. I will keep it.

176
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,722
Lawyer Daggett will prove
ownership of the gray horse.

177
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,473
He will come after you
with a writ of replevin.

178
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,895
- A what?
- A writ of replevin.

179
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:16,440
All right, now listen very carefully,
as I will not bargain further.

180
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:20,320
I will take the ponies back, and
the gray horse, which is mine,

181
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:24,316
and settle for $300.

182
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,779
Now, you must take that or leave it
and I do not much care which it is.

183
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:35,456
Lawyer Daggett would not wish me
to consider anything under $325.

184
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,840
But I will settle for $320 if
I am given the $20 in advance.

185
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,758
Now, here is what I have
to say about that saddle.

186
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,181
Frank Ross's daughter.

187
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,146
Oh, my poor child.

188
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,145
My poor child.

189
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:03,188
Are you gonna be stayin' with us or
are you hurrying back home to your mama?

190
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,531
I'll stay here if you can have me.

191
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,994
I just spent last night at the undertaker's
in the company of three corpses.

192
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,998
I felt like Ezekiel in the
Valley of the Dry Bones.

193
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,533
Well, God bless you.

194
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,879
You'll be rooming with Grandma Turner.

195
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,043
We've had to double up,

196
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:24,338
what with all the people in
town come to see the hanging.

197
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,464
This was in your poor father's room.

198
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:34,223
That is everything. There are
no light fingers in this house.

199
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:46,406
If you need something for
to tote the gun around,

200
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,901
I can give you an empty
flour sack for a nickel.

201
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:23,276
...I could get him to talk sense
about what he found up there.

202
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,441
And we were close enough that
Deputy Marshal Potter and me

203
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,566
thought we'd better ride over
ourselves and investigate.

204
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,281
What did you see when you arrived?

205
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:36,372
Old woman was out in the yard, dead,

206
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,620
with blowflies on her face.

207
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,124
The old man was inside with his
breast blown open by a scattergun

208
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,121
and his feet burned.

209
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,207
He was still alive but just was.

210
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,294
Said it was them two Wharton
boys done it. Rode up drunk...

211
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,639
- Objection. Hearsay.
- Dying declaration, Your Honor.

212
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:56,134
Objection's overruled.
Proceed, Mr. Cogburn.

213
00:14:56,813 --> 00:15:00,055
Them two Wharton boys,
that'd be Odus and C C,

214
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,141
throwed down on him and
asked him where his money was.

215
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:07,566
When he wouldn't tell 'em, they lit
pine knots, held them to his feet.

216
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,232
He told them the money
was in a fruit jar,

217
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,490
under a gray rock at the
corner of the smokehouse.

218
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,409
- And then?
- Well, he died on us.

219
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,163
- Passed away in considerable pain.
- What did you do then?

220
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,332
Me and Marshal Potter
went out to the smokehouse.

221
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:28,003
And that rock had been moved and the
jar with the money in it was gone.

222
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:31,003
- Objection. Speculative.
- Sustained.

223
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,757
You found a flat gray rock in
the corner of the smokehouse

224
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,432
with a hollowed-out space beneath it...

225
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,103
If the prosecutor's going to give
evidence, I suggest he be sworn.

226
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,931
Mr. Cogburn, what did
you find, if anything,

227
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,686
in the corner of that smokehouse?

228
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:45,899
Found a flat gray rock

229
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,444
with a hollowed-out space
under it and nothing there.

230
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,612
- Then what did you...
- No jar or nothing.

231
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,613
- What did you do then?
- Well, rode up to the Whartons'

232
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,786
near where the North
Fork strikes the Canadian.

233
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,455
- What did you find?
- Branch of the Canadian.

234
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,498
I had my glass.

235
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,536
We spotted them two boys
and their old daddy, Aaron,

236
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,879
down the creek bank with some hogs.

237
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:12,044
They'd killed a shoat, had a fire built
under a wash pot for scalding water.

238
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,546
- What did you do?
- Announced we was U.S. Marshals.

239
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:18,675
I hollered out to Aaron that we
needed to talk to his two boys.

240
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:23,893
He raised an axe and commenced to
cussing us and blackguarding this court.

241
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,561
What did you do then?

242
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:30,566
Backed away from the axe and
tried to talk some sense into him.

243
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:36,109
While this was going on, CC, he
edges over to the wash pot there,

244
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:39,367
behind the steam, and
picks up a shotgun.

245
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,323
Potter seen him, but it was too late.

246
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,540
CC Wharton pulled down
on Potter with one barrel

247
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,714
and turned to do the same
for me and I shot him.

248
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,502
The old man raised
the axe and I shot him.

249
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,838
Odus lit out and I shot him.

250
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,721
CC Wharton and Aaron Wharton were
dead when they hit the ground.

251
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,555
Odus was just winged.

252
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,937
Did you find the jar
with the $ 120 in it?

253
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,984
- Leading.
- Sustained.

254
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:14,906
- What happened then?
- I found the jar with $ 120 in it.

255
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,821
What became of Odus Wharton?

256
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,073
There he sits.

257
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,789
You may ask, Mr. Goudy.

258
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,867
Thank you, Mr. Barlow.

259
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,424
Mr. Cogburn,

260
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,808
in your four years as U.S.
Marshal, how many men have you shot?

261
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,102
I never shot nobody I didn't have to.

262
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,775
Well, that was not the question.

263
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,102
How many?

264
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,775
Shot or killed?

265
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:59,779
Let us restrict it to "killed" so
that we may have a manageable figure.

266
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:02,533
About 12, 15.

267
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,532
Stopping men in flight,
defending myself, et cetera.

268
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:09,289
Around 12, he says, or 15.

269
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,880
So many you cannot keep a precise count.

270
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:16,835
I have examined the records and
can supply the accurate figure.

271
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,598
I believe them two
Wharton boys makes it 23.

272
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:26,098
And how many members of this one family,

273
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,144
the Wharton family, have you killed?

274
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,522
Immediate or...

275
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,022
Did you also shoot Dub Wharton, brother,

276
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,943
and Clete Wharton, half-brother?

277
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:40,116
Clete was selling ardent spirits to the
Cherokee. Come at me with a kingbolt.

278
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,487
A kingbolt?

279
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:49,038
You were armed and he advanced upon
you with nothing more than a kingbolt?

280
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,580
From a wagon tongue?

281
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,538
I've seen men badly tore up with
nothing bigger than a kingbolt.

282
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:57,091
- I defended myself.
- Returning to the other encounter,

283
00:18:57,178 --> 00:19:00,136
with Aaron Wharton and
his two remaining sons.

284
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,965
You sprang from cover
with your revolver in hand.

285
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,891
- I did.
- Loaded and cocked?

286
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,636
If it ain't loaded and
cocked, it don't shoot.

287
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:13,733
And like his son, Aaron Wharton
advanced against an armed man?

288
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,064
He was armed, he had an axe raised!

289
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,022
I believe you testified you
backed away from Aaron Wharton?

290
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,482
- That's right.
- Which direction were you going?

291
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,868
I always go backwards
when I'm backing up.

292
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,870
Very amusing.

293
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,373
Now, he advanced upon you much
in the manner of Clete Wharton,

294
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:36,251
menacing you with that
little old kingbolt

295
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,503
or rolled-up newspaper,
or whatever it was.

296
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:42,507
Yes, sir. He commenced to cussing
and laying about with threats.

297
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,010
And you were backing away?

298
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,846
How many steps before
the shooting started?

299
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,312
Seven, eight steps.

300
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,019
So, Aaron Wharton, keeping pace,
advancing away from his campfire,

301
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,862
seven, eight steps.

302
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,282
What would that be, 15, 20 feet?

303
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,318
I suppose.

304
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,576
Will you explain to
this jury, Mr. Cogburn,

305
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:12,284
why Mr. Wharton was found
immediately by his wash pot,

306
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,620
one arm in the fire, his
sleeve and hand smoldering?

307
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,580
Did you move the body
after you shot him?

308
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,131
Why would I do that?

309
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,587
You did not drag the body over
to the fire, fling his arm in?

310
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,714
No, sir.

311
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,887
Two witnesses who arrived on the scene

312
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,090
will testify to the
location of the body.

313
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:30,142
You do not remember moving the body!

314
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,437
So it was a cold-blooded bushwhack,

315
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,856
while poor Mr. Wharton was
tending to his campfire.

316
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,604
Objection!

317
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:42,109
If that's where the body was, I might
have moved him. I do not remember.

318
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,491
Why would you move
the body, Mr. Cogburn?

319
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:49,241
Them hogs rooting around,
they might have moved him.

320
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,369
I do not remember.

321
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,745
Pencil-neck son of a bitch.

322
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,046
Rooster Cogburn?

323
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,044
- What is it?
- I'd like to talk to you a minute.

324
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,591
What is it?

325
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,421
They tell me you're
a man with true grit.

326
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,680
What do you want, girl?
Speak up, it's suppertime.

327
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,432
Let me do that.

328
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,479
Your makings are too dry.

329
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,478
I'm looking for the man who shot
and killed my father, Frank Ross,

330
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,025
in front of the Monarch Boarding House.

331
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,152
The man's name is Tom Chaney.

332
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,857
They say he's over in Indian Territory
and I need somebody to go after him.

333
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,775
What's your name, girl?

334
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,700
My name is Mattie Ross.
We're located in Yell County.

335
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,702
My mother is at home looking
after my sister Victoria

336
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,873
and my brother Little Frank.

337
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,418
Best go home to them. They will
need help with the churning.

338
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,371
There is a fugitive
warrant out for Chaney.

339
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,127
The government will pay
you $2 for bringing him in

340
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,425
plus 10 cents a mile for each of you.

341
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,673
On top of that, I will
pay you a $50 reward.

342
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,889
What are you?

343
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,304
What've you got there in your poke?

344
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:58,059
My God, a Colt's Dragoon.

345
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,898
You're no bigger than a corn nubbin.

346
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,976
What're you doing with
a pistol like that?

347
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,733
- I intend to kill Tom Chaney with it.
- Kill Tom Chaney?

348
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,485
If the law fails to do so.

349
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,942
That piece will do the job for you,
if you find a high stump to rest it on

350
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,493
and a wall to put behind you.

351
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:12,824
Nobody here knew my father

352
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:15,702
and I'm afraid nothing is going to
be done about Chaney except I do it.

353
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,998
My brother is a child and my mother
is indecisive and hobbled by grief.

354
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,164
I don't believe you have $50.

355
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,591
I have a contract with Colonel
Stonehill which he will make payment on

356
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:29,091
tomorrow or the next day
once a lawyer countersigns.

357
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:35,263
I don't believe in fairy tales or sermons
or stories about money, baby sister.

358
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,515
But thanks for the cigarette.

359
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,435
Isn't your mama
expecting you home, dear?

360
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,858
My business is not yet finished.

361
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,024
Mrs. Floyd, have any rooms opened up?

362
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:31,782
Grandma Turner is...
The bed is quite narrow.

363
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,826
The second-floor back did open up

364
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:38,406
but that gentleman on the
porch has just taken it.

365
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,450
But don't worry yourself, dear.

366
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,911
You're not disturbing Grandma Turner.

367
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,791
My name is LaBoeuf.

368
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:33,135
I've just come from Yell County.

369
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,638
We have no rodeo clowns in Yell County.

370
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:43,771
A saucy line will not
get you far with me.

371
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,306
I saw your mother yesterday morning.

372
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,729
She said for you to come right on home.

373
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,028
What was your business there?

374
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,416
This is a man I think you know.

375
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,666
You called him Tom Chaney, I believe.

376
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,294
Though, in the months I've been
tracking him, he has used the names

377
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:15,094
Theron Chelmsford, John
Todd Andersen, and others.

378
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,677
He dallied in Monroe, Louisiana,
and Pine Bluff, Arkansas,

379
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,053
before turning up at
your father's place.

380
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:24,979
Why did you not catch him in Pine
Bluff, Arkansas, or Monroe, Louisiana?

381
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,351
He is a crafty one.

382
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,642
I thought him slow-witted, myself.

383
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,026
That was his act.

384
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,196
It was a good one. Are
you some kind of law?

385
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,112
That's right.

386
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,077
I'm a Texas Ranger.

387
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,199
That may make you a
big noise in that state.

388
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,494
In Arkansas, you should mind that
your Texas trappings and title

389
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,420
do not make you an object of fun.

390
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,215
Why have you been
ineffectually pursuing Chaney?

391
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,217
He shot and killed a state
senator named Bibbs in Waco, Texas.

392
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,136
The Bibbs family put out a reward.

393
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,638
How came Chaney to
shoot a state senator?

394
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,594
My understanding is there
was an argument about a dog.

395
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,680
Do you know anything about
the whereabouts of Chaney?

396
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,316
He is in the Territory, and I hold out
little hope for you earning your bounty.

397
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,860
- Why is that?
- My man will beat you to it.

398
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,563
I have hired a deputy marshal,
the toughest one they have.

399
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,398
And he's familiar with
the Lucky Ned Pepper gang

400
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:19,904
they say Chaney's tied up with.

401
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,990
Well, I will throw in
with you and your marshal.

402
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,162
No.

403
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,992
- Marshal Cogburn and I are fine.
- It'll be to our mutual advantage.

404
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:31,250
Your marshal, I presume, knows
the Territory. I know Chaney.

405
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,751
It is at least a two-man
job taking him alive.

406
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:37,384
When Chaney is taken, he's
coming back to Fort Smith to hang.

407
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:40,554
I'm not having him go to Texas
to hang for shooting some senator.

408
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:42,973
It is not important
where he hangs, is it?

409
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,597
It is to me. Is it to you?

410
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:49,145
It means a great deal of money to
me. It's been many months' work.

411
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:52,316
I'm sorry that you are paid
piecework and not on wages,

412
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,937
and that you have been eluded
the winter long by a halfwit.

413
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,567
You give out very little
sugar with your pronouncements.

414
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:04,870
While I sat there watching you, I
gave some thought to stealing a kiss,

415
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:08,370
though you are very young and
sick and unattractive to boot.

416
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,827
But now I have a mind to give you
five or six good licks with my belt.

417
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,751
One would be as unpleasant as the other.

418
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,131
If you wet your comb, it
might tame that cowlick.

419
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,803
Mattie, I wish you would leave
these matters entirely to me,

420
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,885
or at the very least, do me
the courtesy of consulting me

421
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,720
before entering such agreements.

422
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,263
I am not scolding you

423
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:35,647
but I am saying your headstrong ways
will lead you into a tight corner one day.

424
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,488
I trust the enclosed document
will let you conclude your business

425
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,566
and return to Yell County.

426
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,443
Yours, J. Noble Daggett.

427
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,203
I was as bad yesterday
as you look today.

428
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,535
I was forced to share a
bed with Grandma Turner.

429
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:53,627
I am not acquainted with Grandma Turner.

430
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,250
If she is a resident of this city,

431
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,423
it does not surprise me
that she carries disease.

432
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,132
This malarial place
has ruined my health,

433
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,214
as it has my finances.

434
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:06,764
I owe you money.

435
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,342
You have not traded poorly.

436
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,223
Certainly not!

437
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:14,807
I am paying you for a
horse I do not possess

438
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:18,110
and have bought back a
string of useless ponies

439
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,028
which I cannot sell again.

440
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,697
- You're forgetting the gray horse.
- Crow bait!

441
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,615
You are looking at the
thing in the wrong light.

442
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:28,116
I am looking at it in the
light of God's eternal truth.

443
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,868
Your illness is putting
you down in the dumps.

444
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,041
You will soon find a
good buyer for the ponies.

445
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:36,370
I have a tentative
offer of $ 10 per head

446
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,586
from the Pfitzer Soap
Works of Little Rock.

447
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,668
It would be a shame to destroy
such spirited horseflesh.

448
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:46,255
So it would. I am confident
the deal will fall through.

449
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,802
Look here. I need a pony. And
I will pay $ 10 for one of them.

450
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:55,810
No, that's the lot price.
No, no... Wait a minute.

451
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,066
Are we trading again?

452
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,395
This one's beautiful.

453
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:23,254
He don't know he got
a rider. You too light.

454
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,086
Easy, boy.

455
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,847
He think he got a horsefly on him.

456
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,927
He's very spirited. I'll
call him Little Blackie.

457
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,558
That's a good name.

458
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,520
What does he like for a treat?

459
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,772
Well, ma'am, he's a horse.

460
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,770
So he likes apples.

461
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:48,025
- Thank Mr. Stonehill for me.
- No, ma'am.

462
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,611
I ain't supposed to utter your name!

463
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,497
See? Sleep.

464
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,792
That is fine. I will wake him.

465
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:00,878
Marshal Cogburn?

466
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,707
It is I, Mattie Ross, your employer.

467
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,007
- How long till you are ready to go?
- Go where?

468
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,214
Into the Indian Territory,
in pursuit of Tom Chaney.

469
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:16,228
You're the bereaved girl
with stories of El Dorado.

470
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,480
How much money you got there?

471
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:22,731
I said $50 to retrieve
Chaney. You did not believe me?

472
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,313
I did not know.

473
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,693
You are a hard one to figure.

474
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,524
How long for you to
make ready to depart?

475
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,780
Well, hold on, sis.

476
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:36,657
I remember your offer but I
do not remember agreeing to it.

477
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,084
If I'm to go up against Ned Pepper,

478
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:44,377
I will need $ 100. That
much I can tell you. $ 100.

479
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,587
To retrieve your man, $ 100.

480
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,010
I will take that $50 in advance.

481
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,264
There will be expenses.

482
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,436
You are trying to take advantage of me.

483
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,514
I'm giving you the children's rate.

484
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,266
I'm not a sharper.

485
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:06,024
I'm an old man sleeping in a rope bed
in a room behind a Chinese grocery.

486
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,235
- I have nothing.
- You want to be kept in whiskey.

487
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,659
I don't need to buy
that. I confiscate it.

488
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,699
I'm an officer of the court.

489
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:16,617
Thank you.

490
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,699
$ 100, that's the rate.

491
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:22,169
I shall not niggle. Can
we depart this afternoon?

492
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,871
We?

493
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,549
You are not going.
That is no part of it.

494
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:31,003
You have misjudged me if you think
I am silly enough to give you $50

495
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:32,258
and watch you simply ride off.

496
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,930
I'm a bonded U.S. Marshal.

497
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,724
That weighs but little with
me. I will see the thing done.

498
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,473
Goddamn ducks.

499
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,305
I can't go after Ned Pepper
and a band of hard men

500
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,358
- and look after a baby at the same time.
- I am not a baby.

501
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,309
I won't be stopping at boarding houses

502
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,147
where there's warm beds
and hot grub on the table.

503
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,323
I'll be traveling fast and eating light.

504
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,777
What little sleeping is done
will take place on the ground.

505
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,907
I have slept out at night before.

506
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,157
Papa took me and Little Frank coon
hunting last summer on the Petit Jean.

507
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,417
We were in the woods all night.

508
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:05,462
We sat around a big fire and
Yarnell told ghost stories.

509
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:06,584
We had a good time.

510
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,462
Coon hunting?

511
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,501
This ain't no coon hunt.

512
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,302
It is the same idea as a coon hunt.

513
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,926
It don't come within 40
miles of being a coon hunt.

514
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,098
You're just tryin' to make your
work sound harder than it is.

515
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,425
Here is the money.

516
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,726
I aim to get Tom Chaney

517
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,179
and if you are not game I
will find somebody who is game.

518
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,935
All I've heard out
of you so far is talk.

519
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,686
I know you can drink whiskey and snore

520
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,642
and spit and wallow in filth
and bemoan your station.

521
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,273
The rest has been braggadocio.

522
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,151
They told me you had grit
and that is why I came to you.

523
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,322
I'm not paying for talk.

524
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,447
I can get all the talk I need and
more at the Monarch Boarding House.

525
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,873
Leave your money.

526
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,917
Meet me here at 7: 00 tomorrow morning.

527
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,087
We'll begin our coon hunt.

528
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,305
Dearest Mother,

529
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:00,767
I'm about to embark
on a great adventure.

530
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:04,263
I have learned that Tom
Chaney has fled into the wild

531
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:07,144
and I shall assist the
authorities in pursuit.

532
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,817
You know that Papa would want
me to be firm in the right,

533
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,861
as he always was.

534
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,607
So do not fear on my account.

535
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:17,526
Though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

536
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,737
I shall fear no evil.

537
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,323
The author of all things watches
over me and I have a fine horse.

538
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:27,411
Kiss Little Frankie for me
and pinch Violet's cheek.

539
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,963
Papa's death will soon be avenged.

540
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,968
I am off for the Choctaw Nation.

541
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,218
Where is Marshal Cogburn?

542
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,770
Went away. Left this.

543
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:54,230
Here inside is a train ticket
for your return home. Use it.

544
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:58,567
By the time you read this, I will be
across the river in the Indian Nation.

545
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:02,826
Pursuit would be futile. I will
return with your man Chaney.

546
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:05,703
Leave me to my work. Reuben Cogburn.

547
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:15,921
Is that Marshal Cogburn?

548
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,424
- That is the man.
- Who's he with?

549
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:19,971
I do not know.

550
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,844
Take me across.

551
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,808
So, you're the runaway.

552
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:27,012
Marshal told me you'd show up.
I'm to present you to the sheriff.

553
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:30,395
That is a story. Let go of my horse.
I have business across the river.

554
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,402
If you don't turn around
and take me across,

555
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,401
you may find yourself in court
where you don't want to be.

556
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,198
I have a good lawyer.

557
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,408
Hey!

558
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,954
Go, Little Blackie! Come on!

559
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,532
That is quite a horse.

560
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,868
I will give you $ 10 for him.

561
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,619
From the money you stole from me?

562
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,076
That was not stolen.
I'm out for your man.

563
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,786
I was to accompany you.

564
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:17,380
If I do not, there is no
agreement and my money was stolen.

565
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:19,708
Marshal, put this
child back on the ferry.

566
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,676
It's a long road,
and time is a-wasting.

567
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:25,221
If I go back, it is to the U.S. Marshals
Office to report the theft of my money.

568
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,596
And futile, Marshal Cogburn,
"Pursuit would be futile,"

569
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,678
is not spelt
F-U-D-E-L.

570
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,739
It is time for your spanking.

571
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,993
Now you will do as the grown-ups say

572
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:51,281
or I will get myself a birch
switch and stripe your leg!

573
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,165
Are you going to let
him do this, Marshal?

574
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,134
No, I don't believe I will.

575
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,884
- Put your switch away, LaBoeuf.
- I aim to finish what I started.

576
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:11,351
That will be the biggest mistake you
ever made, you Texas brush-popper.

577
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,196
Hoorawed by a little girl.

578
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,165
I am not accustomed to so large a fire.

579
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:48,430
In Texas, we will make do with
a fire of little more than twigs

580
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:54,060
or buffalo chips, to heat
the night's ration of beans.

581
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,684
And it is Ranger policy

582
00:37:56,775 --> 00:38:00,233
never to make your camp in the
same place as your cookfire.

583
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,029
Very imprudent to make your
presence known in unsettled country.

584
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,079
How do you know Bagby
will have intelligence?

585
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:14,993
He has a store.

586
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,917
That makes him an authority
on movements in the Territory?

587
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,037
We have entered a wild place.

588
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:23,878
And anyone coming in,
wanting any kind of supply,

589
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,425
cannot pick and choose his portal.

590
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:29,925
That is a piece of foolishness.

591
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,507
All the snakes are
asleep this time of year.

592
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:35,639
- They have been known to wake up.
- Let me have a rope, too.

593
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:39,598
A snake would not bother you.
You are too little and bony.

594
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,477
You should fetch water for the
morning and put it by the fire.

595
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,529
- The creek's gonna ice over tonight.
- I'm not going down there again.

596
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:48,652
If you want any more water,
you could fetch it yourself.

597
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,610
You're lucky to be traveling in a
place where a spring is so handy.

598
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:56,201
In my country, you can ride
for days and see no groundwater.

599
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,204
I have lapped filthy
water from a hoofprint

600
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,580
and was glad to have it.

601
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:04,005
If I ever meet one of you Texas waddies

602
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,504
who says he has never drank
water out of a horse track,

603
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,210
I think I'll shake his hand and
give him a Daniel Webster cigar.

604
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,261
You do not believe it?

605
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,886
I believed it the first
25 times I heard it.

606
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,968
Maybe... Maybe it is true.

607
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:20,814
Maybe lapping water off
the ground is Ranger policy.

608
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,892
You are getting ready to show
your ignorance now, Cogburn.

609
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,729
I don't mind a little personal chaffing

610
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:30,031
but I won't hear anything against
the Ranger troop from a man like you.

611
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,203
How long you boys been
mounted on sheep down there?

612
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,247
My white Appaloosa
will still be galloping

613
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,076
when that big American stud of
yours is winded and collapsed.

614
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,751
Now make another joke about it.

615
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:45,748
You're only trying to put on
a show for this girl Mattie

616
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:47,798
with what you must
think is a keen tongue.

617
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,925
This is like women talking.

618
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:51,128
Yes, that is the way.

619
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,714
Make me out foolish in this girl's eyes.

620
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,179
I think she has you pretty well figured.

621
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,143
Would you two like to hear the
story of The Midnight Caller?

622
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,651
One of you is gonna
have to be The Caller.

623
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:11,777
And I will tell you what to say.

624
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:15,364
And I will do all the
other parts myself.

625
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,264
- Good morning, Marshal.
- Morning.

626
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:42,971
Where is Mr. LaBoeuf?

627
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:46,058
Down by the creek,
performing his necessaries.

628
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:50,312
Marshal Cogburn, I welcome the
chance for a private parley.

629
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:54,570
I gather that you and Mr. LaBoeuf
have come to some sort of agreement.

630
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:57,494
And as your employer, I believe I
have the right to know the particulars.

631
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,617
The particulars is that we bring Chaney

632
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,824
down to the magistrate
in San Saba, Texas,

633
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:06,832
where they have a considerable
reward on offer, which we split.

634
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,668
I did not want him brought to Texas,

635
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:12,876
to have a Texas punishment
administered for a Texas crime.

636
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,711
That was not our agreement.

637
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,513
What you want is to have
him caught and punished.

638
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,842
I want him to know that he is being
punished for killing my father.

639
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:23,474
You can let him know that.
You can tell him to his face.

640
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,852
You can spit on him and make
him eat sand out of the road.

641
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,524
I will hold him down.

642
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:32,524
If you want, I'll flay the
flesh off the soles of his feet

643
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,231
and find you an Indian pepper
you can rub into the wound.

644
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,032
Isn't that a $ 100 value?

645
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,202
No, it is not.

646
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:42,030
When I have bought and paid for
something, I will have my way.

647
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,366
Why do you think I'm paying
you if not to have my way?

648
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,999
It's time for you to learn you cannot
have your way in every little particular.

649
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,590
If you find I fail
to satisfy your terms,

650
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:55,339
I will return your money at
the end of this expedition.

651
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,421
Little Blackie and I are riding
back to the U.S. Marshals Office.

652
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,301
- This is fraud.
- God damn it!

653
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:02,642
- What's going on?
- This is a business conversation.

654
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:03,844
Is that what you call it?

655
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,725
It sounds to me like you're still
being hoorawed by a little girl.

656
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,522
- Did you say hoorawed?
- That was the word.

657
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:09,849
There is no hoorawing in it.

658
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,480
My agreement with the
marshal antedates yours.

659
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:14,483
- It has the force of law.
- The force of law?

660
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,906
This man is a notorious thumper.

661
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:20,360
He rode by the light of the moon with
Quantrill and Bloody Bill Anderson.

662
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:22,696
Them men was patriots, Texas trash!

663
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,822
They murdered women and
children in Lawrence, Kansas.

664
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,828
That's a goddamn lie!

665
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,705
What army was you in, mister?

666
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,412
I was at Shreveport,
first with Kirby Smith...

667
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,748
Yeah? What side was you on?

668
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:35,799
I was in the army of
Northern Virginia, Cogburn,

669
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,593
and I don't have to hang
my head when I say it.

670
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,921
If you had served with
Captain Quantrill...

671
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:41,096
Captain?

672
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,092
Captain Quantrill indeed!

673
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:47,554
- Best let this go, LaBoeuf.
- Captain of what?

674
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:54,485
Good, then. There's not sufficient
dollars in the state of Texas

675
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,109
to make it worth my while
and listen to your opinions.

676
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,782
- Our agreement is nullified.
- That suits me.

677
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:03,570
- It's each man for himself.
- Congratulations, Cogburn.

678
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,869
You've graduated from
marauder to wet nurse.

679
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,468
We don't need him, do we, Marshal?

680
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,715
We'll miss his Sharps carbine.

681
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,017
It's apt to get lively out here.

682
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:50,867
Hey!

683
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,837
Go!

684
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,595
Stay here, sister.

685
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:05,344
I will see Bagby.

686
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:28,992
Has Chaney been here?

687
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:32,450
No. Coke Hayes was, two days ago.

688
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:36,003
Coke runs with Lucky Ned.
He bought supplies with this.

689
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,129
This is Papa's gold piece.

690
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,877
Tom Chaney, here we come.

691
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:45,679
It's not the world's only
California gold piece.

692
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:48,466
- They are rare here.
- They are rare.

693
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:50,973
But if it is Chaney's,

694
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:54,397
it could just as easily mean that
Lucky Ned and his gang fell upon him,

695
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,348
as that he fell in with them.

696
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:58,150
Chaney could be a corpse.

697
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:01,479
That would be a bitter
disappointment, Marshal. What do we do?

698
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:02,984
Pursue.

699
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:05,613
Ned is unfinished business
for the marshals, anyhow,

700
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,568
and when we have him
we'll also have Chaney

701
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,654
or learn the whereabouts of his body.

702
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:11,914
Bagby didn't know which way they went,

703
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,707
but now that we know
they come through here,

704
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,035
they couldn't be going
but one of two ways,

705
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:19,589
heading north towards the
Winding Stair Mountains,

706
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,586
or pushing further west.

707
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,960
I suspect north. More to rob.

708
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:27,385
I bought an eating place
called The Green Frog,

709
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,841
started calling myself Burroughs.

710
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,801
But my drinking picked up

711
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:35,809
and my wife did not care for
the company of my river friends.

712
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,856
She decided to go back
to her first husband.

713
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:40,686
He was a clerk in a hardware store.

714
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:44,898
She said, "Goodbye, Reuben.

715
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,825
"A love of decency
does not abide in you."

716
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:51,495
There's your divorced
woman talking about decency.

717
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:54,123
I told her, "Goodbye, Nola.

718
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,953
"I hope that little nail-selling
bastard keeps you happy this time."

719
00:45:58,047 --> 00:45:59,912
She took my boy with her, too.

720
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,837
He never cared for me anyway.

721
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:07,678
I guess I did speak awful rough to him.

722
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,931
I did not mean anything by it.

723
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,518
You would not want to see a
clumsier child than Horace.

724
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,184
I'll bet he broke 40 cups.

725
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:48,423
Is it Chaney?

726
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:51,631
I would not recognize
the soles of his feet.

727
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:55,051
Well, you'll have to
clamber up and look.

728
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,019
I'm too old and too fat.

729
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:00,936
The Green Frog had one billiard table,

730
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:05,437
served ladies and men both, mostly men.

731
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:09,570
I tried running it myself for a
while but couldn't keep good help.

732
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:12,610
And I never did learn how to buy meat.

733
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,078
Is that him?

734
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:16,830
I believe not.

735
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,574
Well, cut him down.

736
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,582
- Why?
- I might know him.

737
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,626
That was when I went out to
the Staked Plains of Texas,

738
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:32,763
shooting buffalo with Vernon Shaftoe
and a Flathead Indian named Olly.

739
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:37,385
The Mormons had run Shaftoe
out of Great Salt Lake City.

740
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,016
Don't ask me what for.

741
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,973
Call it a misunderstanding
and leave it go at that.

742
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:48,605
Well, the big shaggies
is about all gone now.

743
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:50,481
Damned shame.

744
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:54,660
I'd give $3 right now for
a pickled buffalo tongue.

745
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,706
Why did they hang him so high?

746
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:01,534
I do not know.

747
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,787
Possibly in the belief
it'd make him more dead.

748
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,803
I do not know this man.

749
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:03,562
Why is he taking the
hanged man? Did he know him?

750
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:05,856
He did not.

751
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,191
But it is a dead body.

752
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,770
Possibly worth something in trade.

753
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,280
Well, my second wife, Edna,

754
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:16,029
she got the notion she
wanted me to be a lawyer.

755
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,612
Bought this heavy book called
Daniels on Negotiable Instruments

756
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:21,698
and set me to reading it.

757
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,708
Never could get a grip on it.

758
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:28,037
I was happy enough to set
it aside and leave Texas.

759
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:31,294
There ain't six trees
between there and Canada,

760
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:34,252
and nothing else grows
but has stickers on it.

761
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,219
That's...

762
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,428
I knew it.

763
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,884
- Knew what?
- We're being followed.

764
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:46,894
I asked that Indian to signal with
a shot if someone was on our trail.

765
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:49,854
Should we be concerned, Marshal?

766
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:54,063
No. It's Mr. LaBoeuf,
using us as bird dogs

767
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:56,740
in hopes of cutting in
once we've flushed the prey.

768
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,866
Well, perhaps we could
double back over our tracks,

769
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,742
and confuse the trail in a clever way.

770
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,449
No, we will wait right here,

771
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:11,088
offer our friend a warm hello,
and ask him where he is going.

772
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:08,600
You are not LaBoeuf.

773
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:12,145
My name is Forster.

774
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:16,771
I practice dentistry in the Nation.

775
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:20,908
Also, veterinary arts and medicine

776
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:24,620
on those humans that
will sit still for it.

777
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:27,619
You have your work
cut out for you there.

778
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:35,206
Traded for him with an Indian,
who said he came by him honestly.

779
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:40,886
I gave up two dental mirrors
and a bottle of expectorant.

780
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:47,135
Do either of you need medical attention?

781
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:48,348
No.

782
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:52,019
It's fixing to get cold.

783
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,974
Do you know of anywhere to take shelter?

784
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,856
I have my bearskin.

785
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:05,573
You might want to head over
to the Original Greaser Bob's.

786
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:11,618
He notched a dugout into a
hollow along the Carrillon River.

787
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:17,123
If you ride the river,
you won't fail to see it.

788
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:21,427
Greaser Bob, the Original Greaser Bob,

789
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:25,381
is hunting north of the Picketwire

790
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:28,468
and would not begrudge its use.

791
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:32,771
- Much obliged.
- I have taken his teeth.

792
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:38,485
I will entertain an
offer for the rest of him.

793
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,075
Take my jack et.

794
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,116
Creep up onto the roof.

795
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:56,920
If they're unfriendly, I'll give
you a sign to damp the chimney.

796
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,820
Who is out there?

797
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:25,570
We're looking for shelter.

798
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:28,035
No room for you here. Ride on.

799
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:33,370
- Who all's in there?
- Ride on.

800
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,784
I'm a Federal officer! Who's in there?

801
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:19,370
A Methodist and a son of a bitch!

802
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,709
This is Rooster Cogburn.

803
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:25,794
Columbus Potter and five other
marshals is out here with me.

804
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,216
We've got a buck et of coal oil.

805
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:30,969
In one minute, we will
burn you out from both ends.

806
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,799
There's only two of you.

807
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:34,886
Go ahead and bet your life on it.

808
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:36,804
How many of you's in there?

809
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:40,391
Just the two of us, but my
partner's hit and he can't walk.

810
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:43,856
Is that Emmett Quincy?

811
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:07,042
You said it was a man on the
roof. I thought it was Potter.

812
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:10,629
You was always dumb, Quincy,
and remain true to form.

813
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,052
This here's an awful lot of sofky.

814
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,260
You boys looking for company?

815
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:21,060
That is our supper and breakfast
both. I like a big breakfast.

816
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:26,027
Sofky always cooks up
bigger than you think.

817
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,446
And a good store of
whiskey here as well.

818
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:31,824
What are you boys up to,
outside of cooking banquets?

819
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:33,243
We was just having our supper.

820
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:36,454
We didn't know who was
outside, weather like this.

821
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:39,909
It might have been some crazy man.
Anyone could say he is a marshal.

822
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,251
My leg hurts.

823
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:43,253
I'll bet it does.

824
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:51,095
When was the last time you
seen your old pard Ned Pepper?

825
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:54,264
I do not know him. Who is he?

826
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,842
I'm surprised you don't remember him.

827
00:55:56,937 --> 00:56:00,600
He's a skinny fellow, nervous and
quick. His lip's all messed up.

828
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:03,353
That don't bring anybody to mind.

829
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:07,857
There is a new boy that
might be running with Ned.

830
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:11,690
He's got a powder mark on
his face, a black place.

831
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:15,611
He calls himself Chaney.
Or Chelmsford sometimes.

832
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,287
Carries a Henry rifle.

833
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,115
That don't bring anybody to mind.

834
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,826
Black mark, I would remember that.

835
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:26,539
You don't remember nothing I
want to know, do you, Quincy?

836
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,965
What do you know, Moon?

837
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,384
We don't know those
boys you're looking for.

838
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,462
I don't know those boys.

839
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,465
I always try to help out the law.

840
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:39,267
By the time we get to Fort Smith,

841
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:42,562
that leg will be swelled
up tight as Dick's hatband.

842
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:45,812
It will be mortified
and they will cut it off.

843
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,227
And then if you live, that'll
get you two or three years

844
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:50,187
in the Federal house
up in Detroit, there.

845
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:51,317
You're trying to get at me.

846
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:54,195
They'll teach you how to
read and write up there

847
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,739
but the rest won't be so good.

848
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,446
Them boys, they can be hard on a gimp.

849
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,826
You are trying to get at me.

850
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:04,542
Now, you give me some
good information on Ned,

851
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,794
I'll take you down to
Bagby's store tomorrow

852
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:08,838
and get that ball taken out of your leg.

853
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:11,421
Then I'll give you three
days to clear the Territory.

854
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,297
We don't know those
boys you're looking for.

855
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:16,714
It ain't his leg.

856
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,799
- I was...
- Don't go flapping your mouth, Moon.

857
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:20,976
- It's best you'd let me do the talking.
- I was saying...

858
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:23,099
We are weary trappers.

859
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,014
Who worked you over with the ugly stick?

860
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:29,108
The man Chaney with the
marked face killed my father.

861
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:31,979
He was a whiskey drinker like you
and it led to killing in the end.

862
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:36,282
If you answer the marshal's
questions, he will help you.

863
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,361
I have a good lawyer at home
and he will help you, too.

864
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,744
I am puzzled by this. Why is she here?

865
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,741
Don't you go jawing
with these people, Moon.

866
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,246
Don't you go jawing with that runt.

867
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:50,081
I don't like you. I hope you go to
jail. My lawyer will not help you.

868
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:52,128
My leg is giving me fits.

869
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,672
A young fellow like you
don't want to lose his leg.

870
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,174
- We seen...
- He's trying to get at you.

871
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:59,722
- With the truth.
- We seen Ned and Hayes two days ago.

872
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,051
Don't you act the fool! If
you blow, I will kill you!

873
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:05,558
I'm played out. I need a doctor!
We met Ned and Hayes two days ago.

874
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,700
God damn it!

875
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,957
Oh, Lord, I am dying.

876
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,673
Do something. Help me.

877
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,131
I can do nothing for you, son.

878
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,807
Your pard has killed you
and I have done for him.

879
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,261
Don't leave me lying here.

880
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,596
Don't let the wolves rip me up.

881
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,514
I'll see you're buried right.

882
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:51,895
Tell me about Ned.
Where did you see him?

883
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:55,070
Two days ago. Bagby's store.

884
00:58:56,408 --> 00:59:00,572
They are coming here tonight
to get remounts, and sofky.

885
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:04,200
They just robbed the Katy
Flyer at Wagoner's Switch.

886
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:06,702
I'm gone.

887
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:12,337
Send the news to my
brother, George Garrett.

888
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:16,174
He is a Methodist circuit
rider in South Texas.

889
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,714
Shall I tell him you was outlawed up?

890
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:21,797
It don't matter. He
knows I'm on the scout.

891
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:27,390
I will meet him later,
walking the streets of glory.

892
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,976
Well, don't be looking for Quincy.

893
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:45,112
What do we do when they get here?

894
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:48,699
They ride up. What we want is
to get them all in the dugout.

895
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:52,786
I'll kill the last one that goes
in, then we'll have them in a barrel.

896
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,792
You will shoot him in the back?

897
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:57,340
It'll give them to know
our intentions are serious.

898
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:01,928
Then I'll call down, see
if they'll be taken alive.

899
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:06,012
If they won't, I'll shoot
them as they come out.

900
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:09,727
I'm hopeful that three
of their party being dead

901
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:11,555
will take the starch out of them.

902
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,976
You display great poise.

903
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:20,776
It's just a turkey shoot.

904
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:28,581
There was one time, in New Mexico,
we was being pursued by seven men.

905
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,916
I turned Bo around and
taking them reins in my teeth

906
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,243
rode right at them boys,

907
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:36,045
firing them two Navy
sixes I carry on my saddle.

908
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:40,922
Well, I guess they was all married
men who loved their families

909
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:42,968
as they scattered and run for home.

910
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:45,972
- Well, that is hard to believe.
- What is?

911
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:49,392
- One man riding at seven.
- It's true.

912
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,932
You go for a man hard
enough and fast enough,

913
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:54,480
he don't have time to think
about how many is with him.

914
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:56,559
He thinks about hisself,

915
01:00:56,653 --> 01:01:00,020
how he might get clear of that wrath
that's about to set down on him.

916
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,025
Why were they pursuing you?

917
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,951
I robbed a high-interest bank.

918
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:10,156
You can't rob a thief, can you?

919
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:13,624
Never robbed a citizen.
Never took a man's watch.

920
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:15,373
It is all stealing.

921
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,129
That's the position
they took in New Mexico.

922
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:32,014
One man.

923
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:35,097
I did not figure them to send a scout.

924
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:55,284
Damn.

925
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:59,329
Hello?

926
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:01,665
It is LaBoeuf.

927
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:08,679
We have to warn him, Marshal.

928
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:18,766
Too late.

929
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:47,969
Texas Ranger.

930
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:49,796
What do we do, Marshal?

931
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:52,428
We sit. What does he do?

932
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:14,495
Him in the woolly chaps is Lucky Ned.

933
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:26,841
Well, that's that.

934
01:04:20,065 --> 01:04:21,555
Well, that didn't pan out.

935
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:31,568
You managed to put a
kink in my rope, pardner.

936
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:36,244
- I'm severely injured.
- Yes, you got drug some.

937
01:04:36,748 --> 01:04:39,581
Also shot by a rifle.

938
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:43,660
That's quite possible. The scheme
did not develop as I had planned.

939
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:48,214
You've been shot in the shoulder,
but the bullet passed through.

940
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:49,882
What happened to your mouth?

941
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:52,465
I believe I bit myself.

942
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:54,216
A couple of teeth loose and...

943
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:58,262
Oh, yeah, the tongue
is bit almost through.

944
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:01,470
Do you want to see if it will
knit or should I just yank it free?

945
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:05,019
I know a teamster who bit his tongue
off, being thrown from a horse.

946
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:07,852
After a time he learned to make
himself more or less understood.

947
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:09,311
I'll just yank it free.

948
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:12,022
What? What's that, now?

949
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:13,903
- Knit.
- What's that now?

950
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,824
Knit. It will knit.

951
01:05:16,121 --> 01:05:20,285
Very well. It's impossible
to bind a tongue wound.

952
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,332
Too bad, we just run
across a doctor of sorts.

953
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,705
- Marshal?
- But I do not know

954
01:05:24,796 --> 01:05:25,831
where he was headed.

955
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,083
I saw him, too. It's
how I came to be here.

956
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,756
Neither of these men are Chaney.

957
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:32,925
I know, and I know them both.

958
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:38,716
That ugly one is Coke Hayes. Him
uglier still is Clement Parmalee.

959
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,890
Parmalee and his brothers have a silver
claim in the Winding Stair Mountains

960
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:45,472
and I bet that's where
Lucky Ned's gang is waiting.

961
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,767
We'll sleep here, follow in the morning.

962
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:51,023
We promised to bury
the poor soul inside.

963
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:53,021
Ground is too hard.

964
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,860
If them men wanted a decent burial,

965
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,442
they should have got
themselves killed in summer.

966
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:03,699
Sleep well, Little Blackie.

967
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,876
I have a notion that tomorrow
we will reach our object.

968
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,212
We are hot on the trail.

969
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:13,167
It seems that we will overtake Tom
Chaney in the Winding Stair Mountains.

970
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:15,798
I would not want to be in his shoes.

971
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:28,311
As I understand it,
Chaney, or Chelmsford,

972
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:32,064
as he called himself in
Texas, shot the Senator's dog.

973
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:36,231
When the Senator remonstrated,
Chelmsford shot him as well.

974
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:38,984
Now, you could argue that
the shooting of the dog

975
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:41,535
was merely an instance
of malum prohibitum,

976
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:45,366
but the shooting of a senator is
indubitably an instance of malum in se.

977
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:47,242
Malla-men what?

978
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:48,998
Malum in se.

979
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:52,247
The distinction is between an
act that is wrong in itself,

980
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:56,460
and an act that is wrong only according
to our laws and mores. It is Latin.

981
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:03,183
I'm struck that LaBoeuf
has been shot, trampled,

982
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,260
and nearly severed his tongue

983
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:10,690
and not only does he not cease to talk,
but he spills the banks of English.

984
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:18,239
I was within 300 yards
of Chelmsford once.

985
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,700
The closest I have been.

986
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:24,745
With the Sharps carbine,
that is within range.

987
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:26,952
But I was mounted,

988
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:31,833
and had the choice of firing offhand,
or dismounting to shoot from rest,

989
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:34,798
which would allow Chelmsford
to augment the distance.

990
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:38,502
I fired mounted

991
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,047
and fired wide.

992
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:50,556
You could not hit a man at 300 yards
if your gun was resting on Gibraltar.

993
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:54,814
The Sharps carbine is an instrument
of uncanny power and precision.

994
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:57,896
I have no doubt that the gun is sound.

995
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,149
My clothes is all ragged

996
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:03,656
My language is rough

997
01:08:03,955 --> 01:08:07,994
My bread is corn dodgers,
both solid and tough

998
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:12,999
And yet I am happy, and live at my ease

999
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:17,503
On sorghum molasses,
and bacon and cheese

1000
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:20,384
Greer County Bachelor, that was.

1001
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,471
I do not believe he slept.

1002
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,016
Fort Smith is a healthy
distance, LaBoeuf,

1003
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:38,274
but I would encourage the
creature you ride to head thither.

1004
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:41,732
Out here, a one-armed
man looks like easy prey.

1005
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:46,945
And a one-eyed man who can't shoot?
Why don't you turn back, Cogburn?

1006
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,826
I'll do fine.

1007
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:51,453
I know where the Parmalee claim is.

1008
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:55,503
I am uninjured and well-provisioned
and we agreed to separate.

1009
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,589
In conscience, you
cannot cite our agreement.

1010
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:01,964
- You're the one who shot me.
- Mr. LaBoeuf has a point, Marshal.

1011
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:05,551
It is an unfair leg-up in any
competition to shoot your opposite number.

1012
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:09,134
God damn it! I do not accept it as
a given that I did shoot LaBoeuf.

1013
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:10,889
There were plenty of guns going off.

1014
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,596
I heard the rifle and I felt the ball.

1015
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:15,227
You missed your shot, Cogburn, admit it.

1016
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:16,603
Missed my shot?

1017
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:20,607
You are more handicapped without
the eye than I without the arm.

1018
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:23,944
I can hit a gnat's eye at 90 yards.

1019
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:37,791
That Chinaman is running
them cheap shells on me again.

1020
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:40,794
I thought you were gonna
say the sun was in your eyes.

1021
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,592
That is to say, your eye.

1022
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:30,389
Two at one time!

1023
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,861
I will chuck one high. Hold fire.

1024
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:58,577
- There.
- There?

1025
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,044
- My bullet.
- Your bullet?

1026
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:04,044
If you hit what you aim
at, explain my shoulder!

1027
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:05,841
Gentlemen, shooting cornbread
out here on the prairie

1028
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,759
is getting us no closer
to the Ned Pepper gang.

1029
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:10,463
One more. This will prove it.

1030
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:11,889
Please hold fire.

1031
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:39,219
Find our way back!

1032
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:41,770
Very few fiddle tunes I have not heard.

1033
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:45,065
Once heard, they're locked
into my mind forever.

1034
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:55,781
Lucky Ned?

1035
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:08,665
Lucky Ned!

1036
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:13,336
Very good, Cogburn. Now what?

1037
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:21,518
Oh, God damn it.

1038
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:24,813
Cogburn does not want me
eating out of his store.

1039
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:27,976
That is silly. You have not eaten
all day, and it is my store, not his.

1040
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:30,061
Let him starve!

1041
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:36,401
He does not track! He does not
shoot, except at foodstuffs!

1042
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:39,453
- That was your initiative.
- He does not contribute.

1043
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:43,287
He's a man who walks
in front of bullets!

1044
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:45,993
Mr. LaBoeuf drew single-handed
upon the Lucky Ned Pepper gang

1045
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:47,919
while we fired safely from cover.

1046
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:49,122
We?

1047
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:52,674
It is unfair to indict a man when
his jaw is swollen and tongue mangled

1048
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:54,878
and who is therefore unable
to rise to his own defense!

1049
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:56,963
I can speak for myself.

1050
01:13:57,058 --> 01:14:00,516
I am hardly obliged to answer
the ravings of a drunkard.

1051
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:01,718
It is beneath me.

1052
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,646
I shall make my own camp elsewhere.

1053
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:11,147
It is you who have
nothing to offer, Cogburn.

1054
01:14:11,238 --> 01:14:12,728
A sad picture indeed.

1055
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:16,365
This is no longer a
manhunt. It is a debauch.

1056
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:20,702
The Texas Ranger presses on alone.

1057
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:25,575
Take the girl. I bow out.

1058
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:30,496
A fine thing to decide
once you brought her

1059
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:32,172
into the middle of the Choctaw Nation.

1060
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:33,920
I bow out! I wash my hands!

1061
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:35,967
Gentlemen, we cannot
fall out in this fashion.

1062
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:38,838
Not so close to our goal,
with Tom Chaney nearly in hand.

1063
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:39,968
In hand?

1064
01:14:41,519 --> 01:14:43,430
If he is not in a shallow grave

1065
01:14:43,521 --> 01:14:46,729
somewhere between here
and Fort Smith, he is gone!

1066
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:48,726
Long gone!

1067
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:52,234
Thanks to Mr. LaBoeuf,
we missed our shot.

1068
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:55,275
We've barked, and the birds have flown!

1069
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:56,981
Gone, gone, gone!

1070
01:14:57,451 --> 01:14:59,737
Lucky Ned and his cohort gone.

1071
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:01,490
Your $50 gone!

1072
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:04,538
Gone the whiskey, seized in evidence!

1073
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:08,459
The trail is cold,
if there ever was one.

1074
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:12,375
I'm...

1075
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:17,301
I'm a foolish old man who has
been drawn into a wild-goose chase

1076
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:21,551
by a harpy in trousers and a nincompoop!

1077
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:28,055
Well, Mr. LaBoeuf, he can wander the
Choctaw Nation for as long as he likes.

1078
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:31,061
Perhaps the local
Indians will take him in

1079
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:33,814
and honor his gibberings
by making him chief!

1080
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:37,525
You, sister, may go where you like.

1081
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:40,528
Our engagement is terminated.

1082
01:15:42,997 --> 01:15:44,487
I bow out.

1083
01:15:52,465 --> 01:15:55,502
- I am going with you.
- That is not possible.

1084
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:57,838
Have I held you back?

1085
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:01,591
I have a Colt's Dragoon
revolver which I know how to use,

1086
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:04,094
and I will be no more of a burden
to you than I was to the marshal.

1087
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:08,895
That is not my worry. You've earned
your spurs. That is clear enough.

1088
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:12,607
You've been a regular
old hand on the trail.

1089
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:15,442
But Cogburn is right,

1090
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:18,612
even if I would not give him
the satisfaction of conceding it.

1091
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:22,198
The trail is cold

1092
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:27,413
and I am considerably diminished.

1093
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:29,164
How can you give up now

1094
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,242
after the many months you've
dedicated to finding Chaney?

1095
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,874
You have shown great determination.

1096
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:38,044
I misjudged you.

1097
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,588
I picked the wrong man.

1098
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:50,728
I would go on in your company
if there were a clear way to go.

1099
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:54,307
But we'd be striking out blindly.

1100
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:57,442
Chelmsford's gone.

1101
01:16:58,906 --> 01:17:00,897
We chased him right off the map.

1102
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:04,320
There's nothing for it.

1103
01:17:08,207 --> 01:17:10,118
I'm bound for Texas.

1104
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:12,578
Time for you to go home, too.

1105
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:15,707
The marshal, when he sobers,

1106
01:17:17,842 --> 01:17:18,922
is your way back.

1107
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:22,051
I will not go back. Not
without Chaney, dead or alive.

1108
01:17:25,683 --> 01:17:27,674
I misjudged you as well.

1109
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:32,261
I extend my hand.

1110
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:34,764
Mr. LaBoeuf, please.

1111
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:38,266
I know you.

1112
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:45,444
Your name is Mattie. You're
little Mattie the bookkeeper.

1113
01:19:47,408 --> 01:19:48,614
Isn't that something?

1114
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:50,692
Yes, and I know you, Tom Chaney.

1115
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:56,196
- What are you doing out here?
- Come to fetch some water.

1116
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,707
I mean, what are you doing
in these mountains here?

1117
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,455
I have not been formally deputized

1118
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:02,537
but I'm acting as an agent
for Marshal Reuben Cogburn

1119
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:03,996
and Judge Parker's court.

1120
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:12,551
I have come to take
you back to Fort Smith.

1121
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:20,562
Well, I will not go.
How do you like that?

1122
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:23,774
There is a posse of officers up
there who will force you to go.

1123
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:27,236
That is interesting news.
How many is up there?

1124
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:31,398
Right around 50. And they're all
well-armed and they mean business.

1125
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:33,817
What I want you to do now
is come on across the creek

1126
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:35,743
and walk in front of me up that hill.

1127
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:39,703
I think I will oblige the
officers to come after me.

1128
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:42,413
Well, if you refuse to go,
I will have to shoot you.

1129
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:46,918
Well, then, you had
better cock your piece.

1130
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:50,255
All the way back.

1131
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:53,129
- Till it locks.
- I know how to do it.

1132
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:56,723
- You will not go with me?
- No, it's just the other way around.

1133
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:58,266
You're going with me.

1134
01:21:08,906 --> 01:21:12,114
- I did not think you would do it.
- Well, what do you think now?

1135
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:14,024
One of my short ribs is broken.

1136
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:17,031
You killed my father when
he was trying to help you.

1137
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:19,829
I have one of the gold pieces you
stole from him. Now give me the other.

1138
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:21,532
- Nothing's gone right for me.
- Mattie!

1139
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:24,209
- I'm down here.
- Now I'm shot by a child.

1140
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:25,911
Chaney is taken into custody.

1141
01:21:32,471 --> 01:21:34,211
- Help me!
- Mattie!

1142
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:38,424
Marshal!

1143
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:46,648
Take them horses you got and move!

1144
01:21:52,491 --> 01:21:54,982
Tom, you get on up that
hill. Don't you stop.

1145
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:01,948
- Who all's down there?
- Marshal Cogburn and 50 more officers.

1146
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:10,919
You tell me another lie
and I'll stove your head in.

1147
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:12,715
Just the marshal.

1148
01:22:14,555 --> 01:22:15,965
Rooster.

1149
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:21,008
Cogburn! You hear me?

1150
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:26,305
You answer me, Rooster!

1151
01:22:27,151 --> 01:22:30,063
I will kill this girl.
You know I will do it.

1152
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:35,152
The girl is nothing to me!
She's a runaway from Arkansas!

1153
01:22:35,576 --> 01:22:39,319
That is all very well. Do
you advise that I kill her?

1154
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:46,917
Do what you think is best, Ned!
She's nothing to me but a lost child.

1155
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:50,628
Think it over first.

1156
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,632
I have already thought it over.

1157
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:55,550
You get mounted double fast!

1158
01:22:55,637 --> 01:23:00,427
If I see you riding over that bald ridge
to the northwest, I will spare the girl.

1159
01:23:01,268 --> 01:23:02,383
You have five minutes!

1160
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:05,470
There will be a party of
marshals here soon, Ned!

1161
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:09,728
Let me have the girl and Chaney, and
I will mislead them for six hours.

1162
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:13,022
Too thin, Rooster. Too thin!

1163
01:23:13,697 --> 01:23:16,530
Your five minutes is
running! No more talk.

1164
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:21,652
Get on up that hill!

1165
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:25,743
Quiet there.

1166
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:37,467
- Farrell, see to Tom's wound.
- Can I have some of that bacon?

1167
01:23:37,638 --> 01:23:40,380
You help yourself.
Have some of the coffee.

1168
01:23:40,641 --> 01:23:42,882
I do not drink coffee. I'm 14.

1169
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,810
Well, we do not have buttermilk
and we do not have bread.

1170
01:23:47,147 --> 01:23:49,308
- We are poorly supplied.
- Where is she?

1171
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:51,856
- What are you doing here?
- I ought to wring your scrawny neck.

1172
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:53,309
You let that go.

1173
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:56,695
What happened, huh?

1174
01:23:56,907 --> 01:23:58,898
I will tell you and you will
see that I am in the right.

1175
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:01,567
Tom Chaney there shot my
father to death in Fort Smith,

1176
01:24:01,662 --> 01:24:04,119
and robbed him of two gold
pieces and stole his mare.

1177
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:07,368
I was informed Rooster Cogburn had grit
and I hired him to find the murderer.

1178
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:10,287
A few minutes ago, I came upon
Chaney watering the horses.

1179
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:12,911
He would not be taken
in charge and I shot him.

1180
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:16,127
If I had killed him, I would not be
now in this fix. My revolver misfired.

1181
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:21,295
It will do it. It will
embarrass you every time.

1182
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:24,882
Most girls like to play pretties,
but you like guns, do you?

1183
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:26,758
I do not care a thing
in the world about guns.

1184
01:24:26,853 --> 01:24:28,059
If I did, I would have one that worked.

1185
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:29,852
I was shot from ambush, Ned.

1186
01:24:29,982 --> 01:24:33,270
My horses was blowing and making
noise. That officer got me.

1187
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,521
How can you sit there
and tell such a big story?

1188
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:38,316
That pit is 100 feet deep
and I will throw you in it.

1189
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:41,486
I'll leave you to scream and
rot! How do you like that?

1190
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:43,488
No, you won't. This man will
not let you have your way.

1191
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:46,070
He is your boss and you
have to do as he tells you.

1192
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:48,496
Well, nothing's going my way.

1193
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:51,166
Was that Rooster waylaid
us night before last?

1194
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:52,913
It was Marshal Cogburn and myself.

1195
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:56,838
You and Cogburn. Quite the posse.

1196
01:25:15,402 --> 01:25:18,314
- Let us move, Ned.
- In good time, Doctor.

1197
01:25:18,405 --> 01:25:19,895
What happened to Quincy and The Kid?

1198
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:24,070
They are both dead.

1199
01:25:25,037 --> 01:25:27,744
I was in the very middle of it.
It was a terrible thing to see.

1200
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:30,865
Please, let us move,
Ned. The marshal's gone.

1201
01:25:31,418 --> 01:25:34,581
- Do you need a good lawyer?
- I need a good judge.

1202
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:38,877
What happened to Coke Hayes, the
old fellow shot off his horse?

1203
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:43,218
Dead as well. His depredations
have come to an end.

1204
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:46,296
Your friend Rooster does
not collect many prisoners.

1205
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:48,302
He is not my friend.

1206
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:52,227
He's abandoned me to
a congress of louts.

1207
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:54,972
You do not varnish your opinion.

1208
01:25:55,442 --> 01:25:56,522
Are we off?

1209
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:59,067
Let us cut up the winnings
from the Katy Flyer.

1210
01:25:59,237 --> 01:26:01,068
There'll be time for
that at The Old Place.

1211
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:03,898
- I will mount the bay.
- I have other plans for you.

1212
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:06,358
- Must I double-mount
with the doctor? - No.

1213
01:26:06,453 --> 01:26:09,286
No, too chancy with two men
up if it comes to a race.

1214
01:26:09,956 --> 01:26:11,571
Tom, you wait here with the girl.

1215
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:14,579
When we reach Ma's house, I'll send
Carroll back with a fresh mount.

1216
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:18,294
You will be out by dark, and we
will meet you at The Old Place.

1217
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:19,629
I do not like that.

1218
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:22,966
Let me ride with you, Ned,
just out of here anyway.

1219
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:25,632
- We're short a horse.
- Marshals will come swarming.

1220
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:28,972
Hours, if they come here at all.
They'll think that we've all gone.

1221
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:31,683
I am not staying here by
myself with Tom Chaney.

1222
01:26:31,937 --> 01:26:34,269
- That's the way I will have it.
- He will kill me.

1223
01:26:34,773 --> 01:26:36,309
You heard him say it.
He's killed my father

1224
01:26:36,441 --> 01:26:37,851
and now you will let him kill me.

1225
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:39,649
He will do no such thing.

1226
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:43,771
Tom, you know the crossing at Cypress
Forks, near the log meeting house?

1227
01:26:44,491 --> 01:26:47,153
When you are mounted, you take
the girl and leave her there.

1228
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:48,866
Do you understand, Tom?

1229
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:52,617
Any harm comes to that
child, you do not get paid.

1230
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:57,960
Harold, let me ride up with you.

1231
01:26:58,964 --> 01:26:59,953
Farrell!

1232
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:03,632
I will pay you $50 out of
my winnings. I am not heavy.

1233
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:07,131
Do the calf again, Harold!

1234
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:35,659
Everything is against me.

1235
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:37,992
You have no reason to whine.

1236
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:41,252
If you act as the bandit chief
instructed, and no harm comes to me,

1237
01:27:41,339 --> 01:27:43,204
you will get your
winnings at The Old Place.

1238
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:46,833
Lucky Ned has left me, knowing I am
sure to be caught when I leave on foot.

1239
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:51,092
I must think over my position
and how I may improve it.

1240
01:27:51,683 --> 01:27:53,344
Where is the second
California gold piece?

1241
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:58,686
- What have you done with Papa's mare?
- Keep still.

1242
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,356
Are you thinking about The Old Place?

1243
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:05,102
Look here, if you let me go, I
will swear to it in an affidavit

1244
01:28:05,197 --> 01:28:07,563
and once you are brought to
justice it may go easier on you.

1245
01:28:10,869 --> 01:28:13,030
I tell you, I can do better than that.

1246
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:21,042
I need no affidavit.

1247
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:28,591
All I need is your silence.

1248
01:28:33,475 --> 01:28:35,887
Your father was a busybody like you.

1249
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:40,555
In honesty, I do not regret shooting
him. He thought Tom Chaney was small.

1250
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:46,063
And you, you would give me an affidavit.
You're all against me. Every...

1251
01:28:52,786 --> 01:28:54,071
So that is Chelmsford.

1252
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:58,072
Strange to be so close to him at last.

1253
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:01,332
Mr. LaBoeuf. How is
it that you are here?

1254
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,912
I heard a shot and
went down to the river.

1255
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:09,841
Cogburn outlined a plan. Mind
your footing, there's a pit there.

1256
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:13,762
His part, I fear, is rash.

1257
01:29:16,268 --> 01:29:18,600
He returns for Lucky Ned.

1258
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:39,033
Well, Rooster, will
you give us the road?

1259
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,039
One against four? It is ill-advised.

1260
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:44,037
He would not be dissuaded.

1261
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:45,292
Hello, Ned.

1262
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:47,538
How many men is with the girl?

1263
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:50,465
Just Chaney. Our agreement is in force.

1264
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:53,968
She was in excellent
health when last I saw her.

1265
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:58,848
Farrell, I want you and
your brother to stand clear.

1266
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:03,850
You as well, Doctor. I have
no interest in you today.

1267
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:09,480
What is your intention, Rooster?
You think one on four is a dogfall?

1268
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:12,650
I mean to kill you in one minute, Ned.

1269
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:17,401
Or see you hanged in Fort Smith
at Judge Parker's convenience.

1270
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:19,991
Which will you have?

1271
01:30:20,707 --> 01:30:24,370
I call that bold talk
for a one-eyed fat man!

1272
01:30:29,215 --> 01:30:31,376
Fill your hand, you son of a bitch!

1273
01:30:47,067 --> 01:30:50,525
- Shoot them, Mr. LaBoeuf.
- Too far. Moving too fast.

1274
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:33,727
Well, Rooster,

1275
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:37,234
I am shot to pieces.

1276
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:42,486
It seems neither of us
is to see Judge Parker.

1277
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:52,749
Oh, Lord.

1278
01:32:06,104 --> 01:32:09,847
Some bully shot! That
was 400 yards, at least.

1279
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:14,605
Well, the Sharps carbine is a...

1280
01:32:29,627 --> 01:32:31,367
Stand up, Tom Chaney.

1281
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:11,036
Mr. LaBoeuf.

1282
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:16,045
Are you alive?

1283
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:31,120
Mr. LaBoeuf!

1284
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:37,501
Mr. LaBoeuf!

1285
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:40,500
Mr. LaBoeuf!

1286
01:34:43,761 --> 01:34:45,342
Are you there?

1287
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:48,387
- I'm here!
- Can you clamber out?

1288
01:34:48,474 --> 01:34:49,759
I cannot.

1289
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:52,179
- There are snakes.
- They awake?

1290
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:53,680
Yes.

1291
01:35:07,035 --> 01:35:08,275
I am bit!

1292
01:35:18,463 --> 01:35:20,954
- Does Mr. LaBoeuf survive?
- He does.

1293
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:24,465
Even a blow to the head could silence
him for only a few short minutes.

1294
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:26,292
Where are you bit?

1295
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:32,682
Look away now.

1296
01:35:59,587 --> 01:36:01,919
I have her. Up with us!

1297
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,045
We're up, Mr. LaBoeuf. Take her.

1298
01:36:12,934 --> 01:36:14,595
She's snakebit.

1299
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:20,354
We're off. I'll send help
for you as soon as I can.

1300
01:36:20,858 --> 01:36:21,938
Don't wander off.

1301
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:24,892
We are not leaving him.

1302
01:36:25,196 --> 01:36:27,938
I must get you to a doc, sis,
or you're not gonna make it.

1303
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:30,398
I'm in your debt for that shot, pard.

1304
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:32,279
Never doubt the Texas Ranger.

1305
01:36:32,704 --> 01:36:34,035
Go on!

1306
01:36:35,456 --> 01:36:36,696
Ever stalwart.

1307
01:37:39,729 --> 01:37:42,812
We must stop. Little
Blackie is played out.

1308
01:37:43,775 --> 01:37:45,390
We have miles yet.

1309
01:37:46,819 --> 01:37:48,275
Come on, you!

1310
01:37:48,905 --> 01:37:49,940
No!

1311
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:54,441
That's it. Come on, now!

1312
01:37:55,078 --> 01:37:56,739
No, stop!

1313
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,010
He's getting away.

1314
01:38:19,268 --> 01:38:21,133
Who's getting away, sis?

1315
01:38:22,105 --> 01:38:23,470
Chaney.

1316
01:38:58,474 --> 01:39:00,214
No. No!

1317
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:02,012
No, no, no!

1318
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:05,303
No, no!

1319
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:12,151
No!

1320
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:41,156
I've grown old.

1321
01:41:03,015 --> 01:41:05,301
A quarter century is a long time.

1322
01:41:20,658 --> 01:41:24,367
By the time we reached Bagby's
store, my hand had turned black.

1323
01:41:25,162 --> 01:41:27,699
I was not awake when I lost the arm.

1324
01:41:30,793 --> 01:41:34,752
The marshal had stayed with me, I
was told, till I was out of danger.

1325
01:41:34,839 --> 01:41:37,376
But he departed before I came round.

1326
01:41:37,883 --> 01:41:40,920
Once home, I wrote him with
an invitation to come by

1327
01:41:41,012 --> 01:41:43,879
the next time he found
himself near Yell County

1328
01:41:44,015 --> 01:41:46,631
and collect the $50 I still owed him.

1329
01:41:47,643 --> 01:41:51,227
I did not hear back from Marshal
Cogburn and he did not appear.

1330
01:41:53,482 --> 01:41:57,350
Then one day I received a note from
the marshal with a flyer enclosed.

1331
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:02,105
He said he was traveling
with a Wild West show,

1332
01:42:02,241 --> 01:42:04,653
getting older and fatter.

1333
01:42:04,744 --> 01:42:07,201
Would I like to come visit him
when the show came to Memphis

1334
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:09,696
and swap stories with an old trail mate?

1335
01:42:11,083 --> 01:42:14,246
He would understand if
the journey were too long.

1336
01:42:17,506 --> 01:42:19,713
Brief though his note was,

1337
01:42:20,217 --> 01:42:22,208
it was rife with misspellings.

1338
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:24,843
Yessum?

1339
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:26,670
I am Cole Younger.

1340
01:42:27,058 --> 01:42:29,049
This is Mr. James.

1341
01:42:30,186 --> 01:42:33,053
It grieves me to tell you
that you have missed Rooster.

1342
01:42:34,231 --> 01:42:36,187
He passed away three days ago

1343
01:42:36,275 --> 01:42:38,732
when the Show was in
Jonesboro, Arkansas.

1344
01:42:39,403 --> 01:42:42,065
Buried him there in the
Confederate cemetery.

1345
01:42:43,616 --> 01:42:47,359
Reuben had a complaint what
he referred to as "night hoss"

1346
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:50,612
and I believe the warm
weather was too much for him.

1347
01:42:52,458 --> 01:42:54,699
We had some lively times.

1348
01:42:56,379 --> 01:42:58,791
What was the nature
of your acquaintance?

1349
01:43:00,383 --> 01:43:02,374
I knew the marshal long ago.

1350
01:43:02,968 --> 01:43:05,801
We too had lively times.

1351
01:43:08,140 --> 01:43:09,255
Thank you, Mr. Younger.

1352
01:43:12,228 --> 01:43:13,559
Keep your seat, trash.

1353
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:19,808
I had the body removed to our plot
and I have visited it over the years.

1354
01:43:24,907 --> 01:43:27,398
No doubt people talk about that.

1355
01:43:27,493 --> 01:43:30,530
They say, "Well, she
hardly knew the man.

1356
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:32,828
"Isn't she a cranky old maid?"

1357
01:43:33,958 --> 01:43:36,165
It is true, I have not married.

1358
01:43:36,293 --> 01:43:38,124
I never had time to fool with it.

1359
01:43:41,507 --> 01:43:44,749
I heard nothing more of
the Tex as officer LaBoeuf.

1360
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:47,802
If he is yet alive, I would
be pleased to hear from him.

1361
01:43:48,764 --> 01:43:50,720
I judge he would be in his 70s now,

1362
01:43:50,808 --> 01:43:52,673
and nearer 80 than 70.

1363
01:43:53,811 --> 01:43:56,678
I expect some of the starch
has gone out of that cowlick.

1364
01:43:58,983 --> 01:44:01,144
Time just gets away from us.
