1
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,840
<i>All right, team,</i>

2
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,036
<i>stay in sight of each other.</i>

3
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,230
<i>Let's make NASA proud today.</i>

4
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,399
<i>How's it looking
over there, Watney?</i>

5
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,914
<i>Well, you'll be happy to hear...</i>

6
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,720
<i>that in Grid Section 14-28,</i>

7
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,713
<i>the particles were
predominantly coarse...</i>

8
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,998
but in 29, they're much finer...

9
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,112
and they should be ideal
for chem analysis.

10
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,555
<i>Oh, wow.
Did everybody hear that?</i>

11
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,438
<i>Markjust discovered dirt.</i>

12
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,636
<i>Should we alert the media?</i>

13
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,632
<i>Sorry, what are you
doing today, Martinez?</i>

14
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,678
Making sure the MAV
is still upright?

15
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,796
<i>I'd like you to know</i>

16
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,916
<i>that visual inspection
of the equipment...</i>

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,593
<i>is imperative
to mission success.</i>

18
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,514
<i>I also would like to report
that the MAV is still upright.</i>

19
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,836
<i>Watney,</i>

20
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,149
<i>you keep leaving
your channel open...</i>

21
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,038
<i>which leads to
Martinez responding...</i>

22
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,429
<i>which leads to
all of us listening...</i>

23
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,790
<i>which leads to me being annoyed.</i>

24
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,470
<i>Roger that.</i>

25
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,835
<i>Martinez, the captain
would like you to please...</i>

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,229
shut your smart mouth.

27
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,200
We'd prefer to use
a different adjective

28
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,959
to describe Martinez's mouth.

29
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,754
<i>Did Beck just insult me?</i>

30
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,912
<i>"Dr. Beck." And yes.</i>

31
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,595
Happy to turn the radios off
from here, Commander.

32
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,830
Just say the word.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,195
Wait, Johanssen.

34
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,555
Constant communication
is the hallmark...

35
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,756
Shut 'em off.

36
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,990
<i>No.</i>

37
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,310
No. Excuse me.

38
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,237
<i>I apologize
for my countrymen, Vogel.</i>

39
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,675
Accepted.

40
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,837
How many samples
do we need, Commander?

41
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,040
<i>Seven.</i>

42
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,636
<i>100 grams each.</i>

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,912
We have a mission update.
A storm warning.

44
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,560
<i>Commander,
you should come inside.</i>

45
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,915
<i>You're gonna want to see this.</i>

46
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
What is it?

47
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,196
<i>A storm warning.</i>

48
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,720
I saw that
in this morning's briefing.

49
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,758
We'll be inside before it hits.

50
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,640
Yeah, they upgraded
their estimate.

51
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,439
The storm's gonna be
a lot worse.

52
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,071
<i>Martinez, how does it look?</i>

53
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,270
<i>Not good.</i>

54
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,119
"1,200 kilometers in diameter,
bearing 24.41 degrees."

55
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,430
That's tracking
right towards us.

56
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,000
"Based on current escalation,

57
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,436
"estimated force
of 8,600 newtons."

58
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,635
What's the abort force?

59
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,439
7,500.

60
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,596
<i>Anything more than
that and the MAV could tip.</i>

61
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,035
Do we scrub?

62
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,429
Begin abort procedure.

63
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,236
We are estimating
with a margin of error.

64
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,999
We could wait it out.

65
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,840
Let's wait it out.

66
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,675
Let's wait it out.

67
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,714
Commander?

68
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,675
Prep emergency departure.

69
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,115
Commander?

70
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,192
We're scrubbed.
That's an order.

71
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,275
<i>Martinez,
how long before take-off?</i>

72
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,476
12 minutes.

73
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,399
Visibility is almost zero.

74
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Anyone gets lost,

75
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,875
hone in on my suit's telemetry.

76
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,040
You ready?

77
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,395
Ready.

78
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,194
Commander, are you okay?

79
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,595
I'm okay.

80
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,234
Commander, we're at 10 degrees,

81
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,800
and the MAV
is gonna tip at 12.3.

82
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,279
Hey! We might be able
to keep the MAV from tipping.

83
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,396
How?

84
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,113
Use the cables from the comms
mast as guy-lines...

85
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,953
anchor it with the Rover's.

86
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,350
Watch out!

87
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Watney!

88
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,636
<i>Warning. Suit breach detected.</i>

89
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,760
What happened?

90
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
He was hit.

91
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,960
Watney, report.

92
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,760
Before we lost telemetry,

93
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,876
his decompression alarm
went off.

94
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,076
Where did you last see him?

95
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,230
I don't know where he is.

96
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
What are the vitals on his suit?

97
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
He's offline.

98
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,914
A complete loss
of signal on Watney.

99
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,196
Beck!
Yeah.

100
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,591
How long can he survive
decompression?

101
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,069
Less than a minute.

102
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,716
Line up, walk west.

103
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,837
He may be prone.
We don't wanna step over him.

104
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,875
Commander...

105
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,679
We're at 10.5 degrees.

106
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,910
<i>Warning. Excessive tilt.</i>

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,799
Tilting to 11
with all the gusts of wind.

108
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,309
Copy that.

109
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,876
Everyone, hone in
on Martinez's suit.

110
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,077
It'll get you to airlock.
Get in, prep for launch.

111
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,754
What about you, Commander?

112
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,594
I'm gonna search
a little longer. Get moving!

113
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,920
Go!

114
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,796
Watney!

115
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,953
Watney, report!

116
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,157
<i>The MAV's
at 11. 6 degrees.</i>

117
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,200
One good gust and we're tipping.

118
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,555
If it tips, you launch.

119
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,074
You really think
I'm gonna leave you behind?

120
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,799
<i>That's an order, Martinez.</i>

121
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,432
Mark!

122
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,758
Mark! Can you hear me?

123
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,034
Martinez, what about
the proximity radar?

124
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,873
Could that detect Watney's suit?

125
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,360
It's made to see
the <i>Hermes</i> from orbit...

126
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,438
not a little piece of metal
from a single suit.

127
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
<i>Give it a try.</i>

128
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,680
Roger.

129
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,920
What is she thinking?
She knows

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,116
the infrared can't
get through a sandstorm.

131
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,437
She's grasping for anything.

132
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
<i>We've got negative contact</i>

133
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,750
<i>on the proximity radar.</i>

134
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
Nothing?

135
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,997
<i>No.
I can barely see the Hab.</i>

136
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,277
Commander, I know you don't
wanna hear this, but...

137
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,510
Mark is dead.

138
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,360
<i>Commander!</i>

139
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,035
Hey, what the hell
is wrong with you, man?

140
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
My friend just died.

141
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,475
I don't want
my commander to die, too.

142
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,869
<i>Stability warning.</i>

143
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,116
We're tipping!

144
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,557
<i>Commander, you need
to get back to the ship, now!</i>

145
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,680
13 degrees.

146
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,120
If we pass balance,
we'll never rock back.

147
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,509
I've got one more trick left,

148
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,034
and then I'm following orders,
Commander.

149
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,400
You're firing the OMS?

150
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
That's right.

151
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,150
Commander!

152
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,035
On my way.

153
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,635
<i>Johanssen, let's go.</i>

154
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,237
Mark!

155
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,840
<i>We're at 11.5
and holding.</i>

156
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,596
<i>Ready to go on your command.</i>

157
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,110
Ready to launch.

158
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,629
Commander.

159
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,633
I need you to verbally tell me
whether or not to.

160
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,870
Launch.

161
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,073
<i>At around 4:30 a.m.</i>

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,519
<i>and we had no choice
but to abort the mission.</i>

167
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,070
<i>Thanks to the quick action
of Commander Lewis...</i>

168
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,358
<i>astronauts Beck, Johanssen,
Martinez and Vogel...</i>

169
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,240
<i>were all able to reach
the Mars Ascent Vehicle...</i>

170
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,837
<i>and perform an emergency
launch at 7:28 Central Time.</i>

171
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,596
Unfortunately,
during the evacuation...

172
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,754
astronaut Mark Watney was
struck by debris and killed.

173
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,878
Commander Lewis
and the rest of her team...

174
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,509
were able to intercept safely
with the <i>Hermes</i>

175
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,671
and are now heading home.

176
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,275
But Mark Watney is dead.

177
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,556
Director Sanders!

178
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,430
<i>Oxygen level critical.</i>

179
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,071
<i>Oxygen level critical.</i>

180
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,559
<i>Oxygen level...</i>

181
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,871
<i>Pressure stable.</i>

182
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,000
Fuck.

183
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,560
Okay.

184
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,030
<i>Okay.</i>

185
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,080
<i>Hello, this is Mark Watney,
astronaut.</i>

186
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,634
<i>I'm entering this log
for the record...</i>

187
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,556
<i>in case I don't make it.</i>

188
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,274
<i>It is 06:53 on Sol 19...</i>

189
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,274
<i>and I'm alive.</i>

190
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,716
<i>Obviously.</i>

191
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,440
<i>But I'm guessing that's gonna
come as a surprise</i>

192
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,598
<i>to my crewmates and to NASA.</i>

193
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,720
<i>And to the entire world,
really, so...</i>

194
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,234
<i>Surprise.</i>

195
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,950
<i>I did not die on Sol 18.</i>

196
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,793
<i>Best I can figure...</i>

197
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,316
<i>this length of our primary
communications antenna</i>

198
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,470
<i>broke off...</i>

199
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,831
<i>and tore through
my bio-monitor...</i>

200
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,390
<i>and ripped a hole in me as well.</i>

201
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,358
<i>But the antenna
and the blood, really,</i>

202
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,477
<i>managed to seal the breach
in my suit...</i>

203
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,074
<i>which kept me alive,</i>

204
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,595
<i>even though the crew
must have thought I was dead.</i>

205
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,750
<i>I have no way to contact NASA.</i>

206
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,913
<i>And even if I could,
it's gonna be four years...</i>

207
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,430
<i>until a manned mission
can reach me.</i>

208
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,671
<i>And I'm in a Hab designed
to last 31 days.</i>

209
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,196
<i>If the oxygenator breaks,
I'm gonna suffocate.</i>

210
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,636
<i>If the water reclaimer breaks,
I'll die of thirst.</i>

211
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,196
<i>If the Hab breaches,
I'm just gonna, kind of...</i>

212
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,430
<i>implode.</i>

213
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,354
<i>And if by some miracle,
none of that happens...</i>

214
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,237
<i>eventually I'm gonna
run out of food.</i>

215
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,996
<i>So...</i>

216
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,280
<i>yeah.</i>

217
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,550
<i>Yeah.</i>

218
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,910
I'm not gonna die here.

219
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,120
32...

220
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,520
33...

221
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,920
34...

222
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,474
35, 36.

223
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,714
Sweet and sour chicken.

224
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,434
What do we got?

225
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,355
<i>Right, let's do the math.</i>

226
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,991
<i>Our surface mission here was
supposed to last 31 sols.</i>

227
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,992
<i>For redundancy, they sent
68 sols worth of food.</i>

228
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,349
<i>That's for 6 people.</i>

229
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,115
<i>So for just me,
that's gonna last 300 sols...</i>

230
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,432
<i>which I figure I can stretch
to 400 if I ration.</i>

231
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,672
<i>So I got to figure out
a way to grow</i>

232
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,513
<i>three years' worth of food here.</i>

233
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,352
<i>On a planet where nothing grows.</i>

234
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
<i>Luckily...</i>

235
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,196
<i>I'm a botanist.</i>

236
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,036
<i>Mars will come to fear
my botany powers.</i>

237
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,712
<i>Pressure stable.</i>

238
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,759
<i>Staple came out.</i>

239
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,279
Fuck you, Mars.

240
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,000
Johanssen, Jesus.

241
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,398
<i>Sunday, Monday, Happy Days</i>

242
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,960
<i>Tuesday, Wednesday, Happy Days</i>

243
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,316
<i>Thursday, Friday, Happy Days</i>

244
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,790
<i>The weekend comes, my cycle hums</i>

245
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,872
<i>Ready to race to you</i>

246
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,390
<i>The problem is water.</i>

247
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,915
I have created
126 square meters of soil.

248
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,072
<i>But every cubic meter
of soil requires</i>

249
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,159
<i>40 liters of water
to be farmable.</i>

250
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,472
<i>So I gotta make
a lot more water.</i>

251
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,511
<i>Good thing is,
I know the recipe.</i>

252
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,072
You take hydrogen,
you add oxygen, you burn.

253
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,240
<i>Now, I have hundreds of liters</i>

254
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,080
<i>of unused hydrazine at the MDV.</i>

255
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,193
<i>If I run the hydrazine
over an iridium catalyst,</i>

256
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,556
<i>it'll separate into N2 and H2.</i>

257
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,119
<i>And then if I just direct the
hydrogen into a small area...</i>

258
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,272
<i>and burn it.</i>

259
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,035
<i>Luckily,
in the history of humanity...</i>

260
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,439
nothing bad has ever happened

261
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,359
from lighting hydrogen on fire.

262
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,799
<i>NASA hates fire.</i>

263
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,076
<i>Because of the whole</i>

264
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,954
<i>"fire makes everybody die
in space" thing.</i>

265
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,272
<i>So, everything
they sent us up here with</i>

266
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,794
<i>is flame-retardant...</i>

267
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,078
with the notable exception of...

268
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,197
Martinez's personal items.

269
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,230
I am sorry, Martinez.

270
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,874
But if you didn't want me to
go through your stuff...

271
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,794
you shouldn't have left me
for dead on a desolate planet.

272
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,874
By the way, I'm figuring
you're gonna be

273
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,236
fine with this,
given my present situation.

274
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
<i>What's everybody doing?</i>

275
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
<i>Taking a holiday
from being cool?</i>

276
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,233
Counting on you.

277
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,680
Whoo!

278
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,356
So, yeah, I blew myself up.

279
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,193
Best guess...

280
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:48,120
I forgot to account
for the excess oxygen...

281
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,671
that I've been exhaling
when I did my calculations.

282
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,591
Because I'm stupid.

283
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,271
Yeah, I'm gonna
get back to work here...

284
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,319
just as soon as my ears
stop ringing.

285
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,035
<i>Interesting side note,</i>

286
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,994
<i>this is actually how the Jet
Propulsion Lab was founded.</i>

287
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,631
<i>Five guys at Caltech were
trying to make rocket fuel...</i>

288
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,995
<i>and they nearly burned down
their dorm.</i>

289
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,640
<i>And rather than expel them...</i>

290
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,713
<i>they banished them
to a nearby farm,</i>

291
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,399
<i>told them to keep working.</i>

292
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,072
<i>And now we have a space program.</i>

293
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,790
Okay.

294
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,753
Hey, there.

295
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,154
<i>The nation was blessed</i>

296
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,999
<i>to have Mark serving
in our space program.</i>

297
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,676
<i>While his loss
will be deeply felt...</i>

298
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,435
<i>the men and women of NASA
will soldier forth...</i>

299
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,438
<i>onward and upward in the
mission of their agency.</i>

300
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,311
<i>By doing so,
they honor the legacy</i>

301
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,999
<i>Mark's leaving behind...</i>

302
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,513
<i>and they ensure his sacrifice
will not be in vain.</i>

303
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,240
<i>I have the honor of speaking</i>

304
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,999
<i>not only for the men
and women of NASA...</i>

305
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,079
<i>but for people
all over the world...</i>

306
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,476
I thought you gave
a lovely speech, by the way.

307
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,033
I need you to authorize
my satellite time.

308
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,714
It's not gonna happen.

309
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,712
We're funded
for five <i>Ares</i> missions.

310
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,111
I think I can get Congress
to authorize a sixth.

311
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
No.

312
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
<i>Ares 3</i> evac'd after 18 sols.

313
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,751
There's half a mission
worth of supplies up there.

314
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,956
I can sell it at a fraction

315
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,360
of the cost of
a normal mission...

316
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,916
and all I have to know is
what's left of our assets.

317
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,633
You're not the only one
who needs satellite time.

318
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,712
We've got the <i>Ares 4</i> supply
missions coming up.

319
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,031
We should be focusing on
the Schiaparelli Crater.

320
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,120
Okay, we got
12 satellites up there.

321
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,276
Surely we can spare
a few hours...

322
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,431
It's not about
the satellite time, Vince.

323
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,000
We're a public domain
organization.

324
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,156
We need to be
transparent on this.

325
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,276
Okay.

326
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,113
The second we point
the satellites at the Hab...

327
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,236
I broadcast pictures

328
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,118
of Mark Watney's dead body
to the world.

329
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,554
You're afraid of a PR problem?

330
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,393
Of course
I'm afraid of a PR problem.

331
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,755
Another mission?

332
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,270
Congress won't reimburse us
for a paper clip...

333
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,159
if I put a dead astronaut
on the front page

334
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,390
of <i>The Washington Post.</i>

335
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,229
He's not going anywhere,
Teddy. I mean, he's not...

336
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,632
He's not gonna
decompose, you know.

337
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,995
He's gonna be up there forever.

338
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,959
Meteorology estimates that
he'll be covered in sand...

339
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,839
from normal weather activity
within a year.

340
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,753
We can't wait a year.
We got work to do.

341
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,559
<i>Ares 5</i> won't even launch
for five years.

342
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,756
We have plenty of time.

343
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
Okay.

344
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,920
Okay.

345
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,878
Okay, consider this.

346
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,197
Right now,
the world's on our side.

347
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,794
Sympathy for the Watney family.

348
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,920
<i>Ares 6</i> could
bring his body home.

349
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,358
Now, we don't say that's
the purpose of the mission...

350
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,397
but we make it clear that
that would be a part of it.

351
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,596
We frame it that way.

352
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,557
More support from Congress.
But not if we wait a year.

353
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,312
We wait a year,
nobody gives a shit.

354
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,720
Vincent Kapoor?

355
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,919
6-2.

356
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,439
7-6-2.

357
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,520
Acidalia Planitia.

358
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,556
What?

359
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,875
Hi. Security?

360
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,600
This is Mindy Park in SatCon.

361
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,235
I need the emergency contact
for Vincent Kapoor.

362
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,275
Yes, him.

363
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,673
Yes, it's an emergency!

364
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,920
How sure?

365
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,516
100%.

366
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,713
You've got to be shitting me.

367
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,593
Prove it to me.

368
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,594
For a start...

369
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,678
the solar panels
have been cleaned.

370
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,754
They could have been
cleaned by wind.

371
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,037
Back it up. Look at <i>Rover 2.</i>

372
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,480
According to the logs,

373
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,560
Commander Lewis
took it out on Sol 17...

374
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,837
plugged it into the Hab
to recharge.

375
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,640
It's been moved.

376
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,559
She could have forgotten
to log the move.

377
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,035
No, not likely.

378
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,316
Why don't we just ask Lewis?

379
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,278
Let's get on CAPCOM and
ask her directly right now.

380
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,360
No. No.

381
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,516
If Watney is really alive,

382
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,233
we don't want
the <i>Ares 3</i> crew to know.

383
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,240
How can you not tell them?

384
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,471
They have another 10 months
on their trip home.

385
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,790
Space travel is dangerous.

386
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,439
They need to be
alert and undistracted.

387
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,795
But they already think
he's dead.

388
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,155
And they'd be devastated
to find out

389
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,879
they left him there alive.

390
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,390
I'm sorry, but you have
not thought this through.

391
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,519
What are we gonna say?
"Dear America...

392
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,393
"remember that astronaut
we killed

393
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,880
"and had a really
nice funeral for?

394
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,549
"Turns out he's alive and we
left him on Mars. Our bad.

395
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,394
"Sincerely, NASA."

396
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,995
Do you realize the shitstorm
that is about to hit us?

397
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,640
How are we going
to handle the public?

398
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,515
Legally, we have 24 hours
to release these pictures.

399
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,870
We release
a statement with them.

400
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,793
We don't want people
working it out on their own.

401
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,710
Yes, sir.

402
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,038
But if my math is right,
he's going to starve to death

403
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,554
long before we can help him.

404
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,870
Can you imagine what he's
going through up there?

405
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,872
He's 50 million miles
away from home.

406
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,235
He thinks he's totally alone.

407
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,874
He thinks we gave up on him.

408
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,400
What does that do to a man,
psychologically?

409
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,877
What the hell
is he thinking right now?

410
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,516
<i>I'm definitely gonna
die up here...</i>

411
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,039
<i>if I have to listen to any
more god-awful disco music.</i>

412
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,840
My God, Commander Lewis,

413
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,832
couldn't you have packed
anything from this century?

414
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,515
<i>Turn the beat around</i>

415
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,791
No, I am not gonna
"turn the beat around."

416
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,314
I refuse to.

417
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,713
Mr. Sanders? Mr. Sanders?

418
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,916
What attempts have been made

419
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,116
to make contact
with Mark Watney?

420
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,314
We're working on it.

421
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,559
Does he have
enough supplies to survive?

422
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,313
We'll be looking into that.

423
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,834
What does this say
about the agency?

424
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,070
Are you gonna resign?

425
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,200
No.

426
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,549
Director Sanders!

427
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,389
<i>It's time to start
thinking long term.</i>

428
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,633
<i>The next NASA mission
is</i> Ares 4...

429
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,954
<i>and it's supposed to land
at Schiaparelli Crater...</i>

430
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,157
<i>3200 kilometers away.</i>

431
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,270
3,200 kilometers.

432
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,349
<i>In four years, when the next</i>
Ares <i>crew arrives,</i>

433
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,840
<i>I'll have to be there.</i>

434
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,758
<i>Which means
I have to get to the crater.</i>

435
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,038
<i>Okay, so here's the rub.</i>

436
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,759
<i>I've got one working Rover</i>

437
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,470
<i>designed to go a max distance
of 35 kilometers...</i>

438
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,519
<i>before the battery has to be
recharged at the Hab.</i>

439
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,640
<i>That's Problem A.</i>

440
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,511
<i>Problem B is this journey's
gonna take me</i>

441
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,037
<i>roughly 50 days to complete.</i>

442
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,271
<i>So I gotta live for 50 days...</i>

443
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,677
<i>inside a Rover
with marginal life support</i>

444
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,035
<i>the size of a small van.</i>

445
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,513
<i>So, in the face
of overwhelming odds,</i>

446
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,717
<i>I'm left with only one option.</i>

447
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,438
<i>I'm gonna have to
science the shit out of this.</i>

448
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,795
Okay, so, success.

449
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,270
Uh...

450
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,714
I have doubled my battery life
by scavenging <i>Rover 1.</i>

451
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,719
But if I use the heater...

452
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:53,472
I will burn through half
my battery every day.

453
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,790
If I do not use my heater,
I will be...

454
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,312
slowly killed by
the laws of thermodynamics.

455
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,040
I would love to solve
this problem right now

456
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,720
but unfortunately...

457
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,236
<i>my balls are frozen.</i>

458
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,072
I can't. I'm calling it.
I'm calling it.

459
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,472
<i>Good news, I may have a solution</i>

460
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,034
<i>to my heating problem.</i>

461
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,510
<i>Bad news,
it involves me digging up</i>

462
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,910
<i>the Radioisotope
Thermoelectric Generator.</i>

463
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,591
<i>Now, if I remember
my training correctly,</i>

464
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,478
<i>one of the lessons was titled...</i>

465
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,838
<i>"Don't Dig Up the Big Box
of Plutonium, Mark."</i>

466
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,912
<i>I get it. RTGs are good
for spacecraft,</i>

467
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,992
<i>but if they rupture
around humans...</i>

468
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,160
<i>no more humans.</i>

469
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,999
<i>Which is why we buried it
when we arrived.</i>

470
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,040
<i>And planted that flag...</i>

471
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,520
<i>so we would never be
stupid enough</i>

472
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,796
<i>to accidentally
go near it again.</i>

473
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,478
<i>But as long as
I don't break it...</i>

474
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,116
<i>I almost just said</i>

475
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,873
<i>"Everything will be fine"
out loud.</i>

476
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,272
Look, the point is,
I'm not cold anymore.

477
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,954
And sure,
I could choose to think

478
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,360
about the fact that I'm warm...

479
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,193
because I have a decaying

480
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,158
radioactive isotope
riding right behind me...

481
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,994
but right now, I got bigger
problems on my hands.

482
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,550
<i>I have scoured
every single data file</i>

483
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,711
<i>on Commander Lewis'
personal drive.</i>

484
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,079
<i>This is officially
the least disco song she owns.</i>

485
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,072
<i>Lookin' for some hot stuff</i>

486
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,953
<i>Baby, this evenin'</i>

487
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,953
<i>I need some hot stuff,
baby, tonight</i>

488
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,593
<i>I want some hot stuff,
baby, this evenin'</i>

489
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,232
<i>Gotta have some hot stuff
Gotta have some love tonight</i>

490
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,914
<i>Hot stuff</i>

491
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,954
<i>I need hot stuff</i>

492
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,835
<i>I want some hot stuff</i>

493
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,874
<i>I need hot stuff</i>

494
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,553
Yeah.
Where is Watney going?

495
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,951
We believe that
he's preparing for a journey.

496
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,191
He's been conducting
incremental tests...

497
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,800
taking the <i>Rover 2</i>
out for longer

498
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,473
and longer trips each time.

499
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,989
To what end?
Why would he leave

500
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,270
the relative safety of the Hab?

501
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,074
Well, we think that
he plans to travel

502
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,480
to the <i>Ares 4</i> launch site...

503
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,915
in order to make
contact with us,

504
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,713
but it would be
a dangerous gamble.

505
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,109
<i>But if we could talk to him,</i>

506
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,554
<i>we would tell him to stay put...</i>

507
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,280
<i>and to trust that we are doing
everything in our power</i>

508
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,352
<i>to bring him home alive.</i>

509
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,193
Thank you very much.

510
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,632
Don't say "Bring him
home alive," Vincent.

511
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,111
You know what?
These interviews aren't easy.

512
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,873
So God forbid
I try to say something

513
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,599
proactive and positive.

514
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
Annie.

515
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,036
No more Vincent
on TV. Copy that.

516
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,433
76 kilometers.
Am I reading that right?

517
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,354
Are you asking me?

518
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,440
I am.

519
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,550
Yes, sir.

520
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,713
Mark drove two hours
straightaway from the Hab...

521
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,758
did a short EVA and then
drove for another two.

522
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,640
We think the EVA
was to change batteries.

523
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,154
He didn't load up the oxygenator

524
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,356
or the water reclaimer?

525
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,394
Every 41 hours,
there's a 17 minute gap.

526
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,472
It's just the way
the orbits work...

527
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,519
so it's possible
that we missed something.

528
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,353
I want that gap
down to four minutes.

529
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,239
I'm giving you total authority

530
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,516
over satellite trajectories
and orbital adjustments.

531
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,720
Make it happen.

532
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,080
Okay.

533
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,951
Let's assume Miss Park
didn't miss anything.

534
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,557
So Mark's not going
to <i>Ares 4.</i> Yet.

535
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,040
But he's smart enough
to figure out

536
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,032
that's his only chance.

537
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,669
Bruce, what's the earliest we
can get a pre-supply there?

538
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,589
<i>With the positions
of Earth and Mars,</i>

539
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,796
<i>it'll take nine months.</i>

540
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,631
<i>It'll take six months to
build it in the first place.</i>

541
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,836
Three months.

542
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,400
Three?

543
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,675
<i>You're going to say
it's impossible</i>

544
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,194
<i>and then I'm gonna
make a speech...</i>

545
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,476
<i>about the blinding capabilities</i>

546
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,676
<i>of the JPL team...</i>

547
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,916
<i>and then you're going
to do the math</i>

548
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,036
<i>in your head
and say something like...</i>

549
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,112
"The overtime alone
will be a nightmare."

550
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,317
<i>The overtime alone
will be a nightmare.</i>

551
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,400
Get started.

552
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,960
I'll find you the money.

553
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,719
We need to tell the crew.

554
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,120
Mitch, we've discussed this.

555
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,429
No, you discussed this.

556
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,998
I'm the one who decides
what's best for the crew.

557
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,669
They deserve to know.

558
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,072
Once there's a real
rescue plan, we'll tell them.

559
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,600
Otherwise, it's moot.

560
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,475
Bruce has three months to get
the payload done.

561
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,438
That's all that
matters right now.

562
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,600
<i>We'll do our best.</i>

563
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,596
Mark dies if you don't.

564
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,916
<i>It's been 48 sols
since I planted the potatoes.</i>

565
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,117
<i>So now it's time
to reap and re-sow.</i>

566
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,840
<i>They grew even better
than I expected.</i>

567
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,834
<i>I now have 400
healthy potato plants.</i>

568
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,232
<i>I dug them up, being careful
to leave their plants alive.</i>

569
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,914
<i>The smaller ones I'll reseed,</i>

570
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,151
<i>the larger ones
are my food supply.</i>

571
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:46,109
<i>All natural, organic,
Martian-grown potatoes.</i>

572
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,590
<i>You don't hear
that every day, do you?</i>

573
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,913
<i>And by the way,
none of this matters at all...</i>

574
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,278
<i>if I can't figure out a way
to make contact with NASA.</i>

575
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,200
<i>I know what I'm gonna do.</i>

576
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,030
Oh! He's moving again.

577
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,556
Where the hell is he going?

578
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,916
He hasn't changed course
for 13 days.

579
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,072
He's nowhere near the <i>Ares 4.</i>

580
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,313
Unless he's not taking
a direct route.

581
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,520
He might be trying to avoid
some obstacle.

582
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,915
What obstacle?

583
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,675
It's Acidalia Planitia.

584
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,558
There's nothing out there
except the...

585
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,310
What?

586
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,672
I need a map.

587
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,040
Yeah.

588
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,989
Hey, come on.
What are you doing?

589
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,236
It's all right.
It's all right.

590
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,396
Can I borrow this?

591
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,279
Okay, so where
is the Hab location?

592
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,554
31.2 degrees north,
28.5 degrees west.

593
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,790
Okay. Mmm-hmm.

594
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,434
Where's Watney?
Uh...

595
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,960
There.

596
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,190
Okay.

597
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,960
Okay. I know where he's going.

598
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,114
I need to get on an airplane.

599
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,956
Vincent, how are you?

600
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,236
Good to see you.

601
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,800
Good flight?
Uh...

602
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,960
Yeah.

603
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,315
It's in storage
just around the corner.

604
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,000
Hey, Vincent,
nice to see you again.

605
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,080
Nice to see you.

606
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,476
What are the chances Mark
can get it working again?

607
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,196
It's hard to say.
We lost contact in '97.

608
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,556
We think it was battery failure.

609
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,720
Though I'd like to point out

610
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,474
it lasted three times longer
than expected in any...

611
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,915
Nobody's criticizing
JPL's work, Bruce.

612
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,036
I just need to speak
to everybody

613
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,120
that was here in '97.

614
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,959
They're already
here. Guys.

615
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,360
I'd like to introduce
Vincent Kapoor.

616
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,352
Director of Mars Missions
for NASA.

617
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,520
This is our current team...

618
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,516
and our original
project members.

619
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,158
- Is this the replica?
- This is her.

620
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,073
Okay. Let's see it.

621
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,160
<i>Pathfinder.</i>

622
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,160
<i>Pathfinder.</i>

623
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,912
Come on. Come on.

624
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,437
Holy shit. Okay.

625
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,509
"Broadcasting status.

626
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,034
"Listening
for telemetry signal."

627
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,156
Uh-huh.

628
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,120
Okay. Signal acquired.

629
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,596
- All right.
- Okay.

630
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,870
Camera.

631
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,075
Incoming.

632
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,994
"Are you receiving me?"

633
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,151
"Yes. No."

634
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,832
Okay, point
the camera at "yes."

635
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,830
32-minute round-trip
communications time.

636
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,354
All he can do
is ask yes or no questions...

637
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,432
and all we can do
is point the camera.

638
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,000
This won't exactly be
an Algonquin Round Table

639
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,190
of snappy repartee.

640
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,033
Are you kidding me?
Tim, Tim.

641
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,714
- Just point the camera.
- Roger that.

642
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,676
Pointing the camera.

643
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,040
Whoo!

644
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,360
Yes!

645
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:23,920
Yes!

646
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,033
<i>So here's the rub.</i>

647
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,916
<i>Somehow we have to have complex</i>

648
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,759
<i>astrophysical engineering
conversations...</i>

649
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,078
<i>using nothing but
a still-frame camera...</i>

650
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,713
<i>from 1996.</i>

651
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,320
<i>Luckily...</i>

652
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,992
<i>the camera does spin.</i>

653
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,278
So I can make an alphabet.

654
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,479
It can't be our alphabet.

655
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,075
26 characters plus
a question card

656
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,595
into 360 gives us
13 degrees of arc.

657
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,120
That's way too narrow.

658
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,914
I'd never know what the camera
was pointing at.

659
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,750
Ooh.

660
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,510
Hexadecimals.

661
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,593
Hexadecimals to the rescue.

662
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,275
<i>I figured one of you guys</i>

663
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,511
<i>kept an ASCII table
lying around.</i>

664
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,796
<i>And I was right.</i>

665
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,070
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

666
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,119
<i>I give you super-nerd
Beth Johanssen.</i>

667
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,513
<i>Who also had copies
of</i> Zork II...

668
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,718
<i>and</i> Leather Goddesses of
Phobos <i>on her personal laptop.</i>

669
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,280
<i>Seriously, Johanssen...</i>

670
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,114
it's like the Smithsonian
of loneliness on there.

671
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,953
<i>Not that I'm complaining.</i>
Yes!

672
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,477
<i>Who am I to talk
about loneliness?</i>

673
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,791
I know where
he's going with this.

674
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,360
"F, O."

675
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,879
"7, W."

676
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,720
Vincent.

677
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,837
Vincent, wake up.

678
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,634
<i>Now that we can have more
complicated conversations...</i>

679
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,116
<i>the smart people at NASA
have sent me instructions</i>

680
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,560
<i>on how to hack the Rover...</i>

681
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,991
<i>so that it can talk

682
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,913
<i>If I hack a tiny bit of code...</i>

683
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,914
<i>just 20 instructions in the
Rover's operating system...</i>

684
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,073
<i>NASA can link
the Rover to</i> Pathfinder's

686

00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,920
"Mark...

00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,638
<i>"Meantime, we're putting

694
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,477
"to keep you fed

695
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,470
Okay.

696
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,400
Okay.

697
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,630
"Glad to hear it. Really
looking forward to not dying."

698
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,434
"How's the crew?"

699
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,240
"What did they say when they
found out I was alive?"

700
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,351
Guys, can we get
some space please?

701
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Me?

702
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,235
Yeah, you.

703
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,629
Give me a sec.

704
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,560
Just tell him.

705
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:12,271
"We haven't told the crew
you are alive yet.

706
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:18,273
"We need them to concentrate
on their mission."

707
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,236
What the fuck?

708
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,150
What the fuck?

709
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,154
Okay, he says,
"They don't know I'm alive?

710
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,079
"What the..." F-word.

711
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,509
F-word in gerund form.

712
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,114
F-word, again,
"is wrong with you?"

713
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:56,276
"Mark, please
watch your language.

"Everything you type

00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:02,593
"is being broadcast live

716
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,280
Yeah?

717
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,600
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

718
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,640
Yes, sir.

719
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,632
He is under
a tremendous amount of stress.

720
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,315
I understand.
We're working on it.

721
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,792
I'm sure
he didn't mean what he said.

722
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,519
Thank you, Mr. President.

723
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,555
Problem is, Mark's right.

724
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,996
The longer we wait,
the worse it's gonna get.

725
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,395
We need to tell the crew.

726
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,155
You're bringing this up while
Vincent is in Pasadena...

727
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,800
so he can't argue
the other side.

728
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,559
I shouldn't have
to answer to Vincent.

729
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,359
Or anyone else.

730
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,073
It's time, Teddy.

731
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,514
<i>Commander Lewis?</i>

732
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,716
Go ahead.

733
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,273
<i>Data dump is almost complete.</i>

734
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,398
Copy that. On my way.

735
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,589
You're in a hurry.

736
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,950
Yeah.

737
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,032
My son turned three yesterday.

738
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,078
Should be pictures of the party.

739
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,472
Got a batch of personals.

740
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,711
Dispatching them
to your laptops now.

741
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,032
I don't need to read Vogel's
weird German fetish emails.

742
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,913
They're telemetry updates.

743
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,469
Hey, whatever
does it for you, man.

744
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,230
There's a video message.

745
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,073
It's addressed
to the whole crew.

746
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,791
Play it. Come on, guys.

747
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,072
I wanna get in on
that telemetry action.

748
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,799
<i>Hi, hello. It's Mitch.
Mitch Henderson.</i>

749
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,072
<i>I have some news.</i>

750
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,914
<i>There's no subtle way
to put this.</i>

751
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,592
<i>Mark Watney is still alive.</i>

752
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,080
Oh, my God.

753
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,877
<i>I know that's a surprise
and I know</i>

754
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,440
<i>you will have
a lot of questions.</i>

755
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,320
<i>But here are the basics.</i>

756
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,915
<i>He's alive and he's healthy.</i>

757
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:42,269
<i>We found out two months ago
and decided not to tell you.</i>

758
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,750
Two months?
Oh, my God.

759
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,116
<i>I was strongly
against that decision.</i>

760
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,514
<i>We're telling you now because...</i>

761
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,036
<i>we finally have
communication with him...</i>

762
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,955
<i>and a viable rescue plan.</i>

763
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,710
<i>We'll give you a write-up
of what happened,</i>

764
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,120
<i>a full write-up of everything.</i>

765
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,794
<i>But it's not your fault.</i>

766
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,600
<i>Mark stresses that
every time it comes up.</i>

767
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,115
<i>So... Yeah...</i>

768
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,072
<i>Take some time to absorb this.</i>

769
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,360
<i>And send all
the questions you want.</i>

770
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:15,874
<i>We'll answer them.</i>

771
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,833
<i>All right. Henderson out.</i>

772
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,993
Holy shit, he's alive.

773
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,155
I left him behind.

774
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,320
- No.
- No.

775
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,073
We all left together.

776
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,993
You were following orders.

777
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,632
I left him behind.

778
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,356
<i>So now that NASA can talk to me,</i>

779
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,550
<i>they won't shut up.</i>

780
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,879
<i>They want constant updates
on every Hab system...</i>

781
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,633
<i>and they got
a room full of people</i>

782
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,677
<i>trying to micromanage my crops.</i>

783
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,354
<i>Which is awesome.</i>

784
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,192
<i>Look, I don't mean to sound
arrogant or anything...</i>

785
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:02,077
<i>but I am the greatest botanist
on this planet, so...</i>

786
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,795
<i>One big bonus</i>

787
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,678
<i>to this communication
with NASA again...</i>

788
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,274
<i>is the email.
I'm getting them again.</i>

789
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,750
<i>Big data dumps
like when I was on the</i> Hermes.

790
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,394
<i>I even got one
from the president.</i>

791
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,520
<i>The coolest one, though,
the coolest one I got...</i>

792
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:16,875
<i>was from University of Chicago,</i>

793
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,440
<i>my alma mater.</i>

794
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,115
They say that once you
grow crops somewhere...

795
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,237
you've officially colonized it.

796
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,351
<i>So, technically...</i>

797
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,800
<i>I colonized Mars.</i>

798
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,712
In your face, Neil Armstrong.

799
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,398
In other news,
there's been a request...

800
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,233
for me to pose for a photograph

801
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,391
on my next transmission.

802
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,515
I'm trying to figure out whether

803
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,399
I should go with
"High School Senior"...

804
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,553
or "coquettish ingnue."

805
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:53,710
But I'm not really sure

806
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,393
how that's gonna look
with my spacesuit on.

807
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:22,760
Hey!

808
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,760
What is he doing?

809
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,991
I asked for a photo, and what,
he's The Fonz?

810
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,839
<i>Just be grateful
we got you something, Annie.</i>

811
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,997
I can't use this, Vincent,
and you know that.

812
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,435
I need a picture of his face.

813
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,159
<i>I could tell him
to take off his helmet...</i>

814
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,039
but then he'd, you know,
die, so...

815
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,556
<i>We'll release the photo</i>

816
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:41,960
<i>when we detail
the rescue operation.</i>

817
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,759
I want to announce
we're launching

818
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,035
some supplies to him
next year...

819
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,714
during the Hohmann
Transfer Window.

820
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,511
Bruce, your team's still
on schedule?

821
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,632
<i>It'll be tight,
but we'll make it.</i>

822
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,280
Nine-month travel time.

823
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,875
That puts the probe
to Mars on Sol 868.

824
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,793
Did we get
the botany team's analysis?

825
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:01,317
<i>Yeah, they estimate Mark's
crops will last till Sol 912.</i>

826
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:04,234
<i>They grudgingly admit that
he's doing great work.</i>

827
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,320
Grudgingly?

828
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,400
<i>Yeah. Mark has a tendency
to tell them</i>

829
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,516
<i>to have sex with themselves...</i>

830
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,359
<i>whenever they question
one of his decisions.</i>

831
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:10,750
Get him in line, Vincent.

832
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,877
We can't afford
any miscommunication.

833
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,189
I hate this margin.

834
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:17,956
912 Sols worth of food.
We get there on 868.

835
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,310
And that's assuming
nothing goes wrong.

836
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:09,194
<i>Suit breach detected.</i>

837
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,475
<i>Oxygen level critical.</i>

838
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,714
<i>Oxygen level, 10%.</i>

839
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,920
<i>Oxygen level, 5%.</i>

840
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,238
<i>Suit pressure, stable.</i>

841
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,192
<i>Pressure stable.</i>

842
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,753
God! God, God, God, God!

843
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,433
Crops are dead.

844
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,910
Complete loss of pressure
boiled off most of the water.

845
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,349
Any bacteria that survived,

846
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,033
died in the subzero
temperatures...

847
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,112
when exposed to
Mars' atmosphere.

848
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,714
How long does he have?

849
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,879
He can still eat
the potatoes he has,

850
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,792
he just can't grow any more...

851
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,960
so give him 200 sols.

852
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,272
Rations get him to what?
Sol 409?

853
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,074
Mmm-hmm.
So with potatoes, 609.

854
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,880
So by Sol 868,
he'll be long dead.

855
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,918
We're gonna have to launch
as soon as possible...

856
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,434
which changes our travel time.

857
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,400
Yeah, we're working on it.

858
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,434
Prelim estimates call
for a 414-day trip.

859
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,157
It's Sol 135 now.

860
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,312
We need 13 days
to mount the boosters,

861
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:43,635
perform inspections...

862
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:46,440
which gives
Bruce and his team...

863
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,551
47 days to make this probe.

864
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:54,118
I'll let you call Bruce,
give him the news.

865
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,435
Okay.

866
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,320
I'm gonna need
a change of clothes.

867
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,479
<i>"Dear Mark...</i>

868

5, 10...

15, 20, 30, 35...

895
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,229
40.

896
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:03,920

897
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,030
Rich.

898
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:36,240
Rich.

899
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,436
Wake up.

900
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:42,431
Sorry, but they're asking for
the probe courses.

901
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,114
What time is it?

902
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,112
It's 3:42.

903
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,955
Look, I know we're
coming at this backwards...

904
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,793
but we can't commit
to a firm launch date

905
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,360
with this many unknowns.

906
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,629
It's all right. Um...

907
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:03,079
All 25 models for launch will
take 414 days to reach Mars.

908
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:04,799
They vary slightly
in thrust duration...

909
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,758
and the fuel requirement
is nearly identical.

910
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,952
Not a good time
to launch, is it?

911
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,954
Yeah,
Earth and Mars are really badly positioned.

912
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,157
Heck, it'd almost
be easier if you...

913
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,155
Almost easier to what?

914
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,754
I need more coffee.

915
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:23,240
Ahh!

916
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:24,800
Are you all right?

917
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
It's fine.

918
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,118
Almost easier to what?

919
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:45,677
You do understand
I'm your boss, right?

920
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:47,680
Uh-huh.

921
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:52,596
All right, let's ask

922
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,990
the very, very
expensive question.

923
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,353
Is the probe
going to be ready on time?

924
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,352
<i>We're behind.</i>
Give me a number.

925
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,592
<i>15 days. 15 days
and I can get it done.</i>

926
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,195
All right, let's create 15 days.

927
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,839
13 days to mount the probe.

928
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,190
Can we reduce?

929
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,591
It actually only takes three
days to mount the probe.

930
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,513
And we can get that down
to two, right?

931
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,034
<i>I can get it down to two.</i>

932
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,873
10 days are for tests
and inspections.

933
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,509
How often do those inspections
reveal a problem?

934
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,439
Are you suggesting
we don't do the inspections?

935
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,871
Right now I'm asking how often
they reveal a problem.

936
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,040
One in 20.

937
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,793
But that's grounds
for countdown halt.

938
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,030
We can't take that chance.

939
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,556
Anyone else know a safer way
to buy more time?

940
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:36,316
Dr. Keller, stretch Watney's
rations four more days.

941
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,233
You're not gonna like it,
but that'll get us to 15.

942
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:39,360
And we'll cancel
the inspections.

943
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:40,470
Teddy.

944
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,313
Sir, if that ever got out...
It's on me.

945
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:43,790
You got your two weeks.

946
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,195
Get it done.

947
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,554
So, now I have to hold out

948
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:50,320
until the probe gets here
with more food.

949
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,199
You want to see what minimal
calorie count looks like?

950
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:54,919
Standard issue ration.

951
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:58,710
But instead of three of these
every one day...

952
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:02,756
I'm now eating one of these
every three days.

953
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,198
And now, they've asked me...

954
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,429
to do that.

955
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,429
The point is...

<i>"stretch the rations

957

958
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:28,513
<i>I'm gonna dip this potato
in some crushed Vicodin.</i>

959
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,273
And there's nobody
who can stop me.

960
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:45,751
<i>It has been seven days
since I ran out of ketchup.</i>

961
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,951
Up. Up, up. Yeah.

962
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:02,159
Let's go up here.

963

964
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,116

966
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,640
Roger that, Flight.
Beginning launch status check.

967
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,797
Do you believe in God, Vincent?

968
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,120
Yeah.

969
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,839
Yeah, my father was a Hindu,

970
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,230
my mother's a Baptist,
so, yeah...

971
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:25,993
I believe in several.

972
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,512
We'll take all
the help we can get.

973
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,319
<i>Launch status check complete.</i>

974
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,000
This is Flight.

975
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,640
We are go for launch.

<i>TVCs look good.</i>

990
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,880
We're getting
a little shimmy, Flight.

991
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,229
Say again?

992
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:36,717
We are getting
a very large precession.

993
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:38,200
Are we good?

994
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,880
<i>Flight,
it's hitting the redline.</i>

995
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,509
It's spinning on the long axis
around a 17-degree precession.

996
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,560
Launch, what's happening?

997
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,399
Force on Iris is 7 G's.

998
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:50,393
We've lost
readings on the probe, Flight.

999
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:57,074
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1000
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:01,749
We've lost it, Flight.

<i>we were forced

Their astronaut is going to die.

1042
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,872
Of course there
are other ways...

1043
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,754
...the Taiyang Shen booster.
Our engineers have run the numbers,

1044
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,754
and it has enough fuel
for a Mars injection orbit.

1045
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,274
Why hasn't NASA approached us?

1046
01:20:58,680 --> 01:20:59,750
They don't know.

1047
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:02,715
Our booster technology
is classified.

1048
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:08,273
So if we do nothing...

1049
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:12,960
The world would never know
we could have helped.

1050
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:18,876
Then, for the sake of argument,
let's say we decide to help them...

1051
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:23,474
We'd be giving up a booster and
effectively cancelling Taiyang Shen.

1052
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:29,635
We need to keep this among scientists,
a co-operation between space agencies.

1053
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,480
Yes.

1054
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,713
Yes, I understand.

1055
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,109
Thank you.

1056
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:45,790
Yes!

1057
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:48,160
<i>All right.</i>

1058
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:49,919

01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,832
we get another chance at this.

1060
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,072
Now, we finished
the <i>Iris</i> probe in 62 days.

1061
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:58,631
We are now gonna attempt
to finish it in 28.

1062
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,595
We can jettison
any kind of landing system.

1063
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:27,114
We're only sending rations.

1064
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,953
We can crash-land on Mars.

1065
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,640
You should hang up the phone.

1066
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,957
I'm sorry, who are you?
My name is Rich Purnell.

1067
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:35,120
I work in Astrodynamics,

01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,350
and you should hang up
the phone right now.

1069
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:39,676
All right, all right.

1070
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:41,840
I'm gonna call you back.

1071
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,640
I know how to save Mark Watney.

1072
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:48,190
Your probe plan won't work.
Too many things can go wrong.

1073
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:49,560
I've got a better way.

1074
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:50,790
Astrodynamics?

1075
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,314
Yeah.

1076
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:55,235
What the hell
is "Project Elrond"?

1077
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:56,640
I had to make something up.

1078
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,234
But "Elrond"?

1079
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,712
Because it's a secret meeting.

1080
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:01,880
How do you know that?

1081
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,394
Why does "Elrond" mean
"secret meeting"?

1082
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:06,155
<i>The Council of Elrond.
It's from</i> Lord of the Rings.

1083
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,356
<i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

1084
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:08,476
It's the meeting
where they decide

1085
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:09,630
to destroy the One Ring.

1086
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,393
<i>If we're gonna call
something "Project Elrond"...</i>

1087
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:13,711
I would like my code name
to be "Glorfindel."

1088
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,912
Okay, I hate every one of you.

1089
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,436
What, Teddy doesn't even
know about this yet?

1090
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:19,750
I'm sorry, who are you?

1091
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,639
This is Rich Purnell,
Astrodynamics.

1092
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:24,240
Tell them what you just told me.

1093
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:27,513
I can get the <i>Hermes</i>
back to Mars by Sol 561.

1094
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:30,240
How?

1095
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:37,080
Could you stand right
there for me, please?

1096
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:39,760
Thanks.

1097
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:40,990
Right there. Great.

1098
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:45,353
And could you stand
right there? Right there.

1099
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:53,875
Okay, let's pretend that this
stapler is the <i>Hermes...</i>

1100
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:56,271
and you are...

1101
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:57,590
I'm sorry,
what's your name again?

1102
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:01,197
Teddy. I'm the Director
of NASA.

1103
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,477
Cool. Teddy,
you're Earth.

1104
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,116
And right now, the <i>Hermes</i>
is headed towards you...

1105
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:08,715
starting its month-long
deceleration to intercept.

1106
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,395
But instead,
what I'm proposing is...

1107
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,597
we start accelerating
immediately

1108
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:19,478
to preserve velocity
and gain even more.

1109
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:20,710
We don't intercept
with Earth at all...

1110
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,200
but we come close enough

1111
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,471
to get a gravity assist
and adjust course.

1112
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:26,472
While we're doing that...

1113
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:30,313
we resupply with the probe...

1114
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:31,480
The <i>Taiyang Shen.</i>

1115
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:33,199
...pick up whatever
provisions we need...

1116
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,511
and now we're accelerating
towards Mars.

1117
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:39,480
You're Mars.

1118
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:40,710
Now, we're going too fast

1119
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,559
at this point to fall
into orbit...

1120
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:44,080
but we can do a flyby.

1121
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:45,240
<i>What good is a flyby</i>

1122
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:46,720
<i>if we can't get Watney
off the surface?</i>

1123
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:50,154
Watney would intercept
using the MAV.

1124
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:51,310
Ow!

1125
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:56,877
And then we just head home.

1126
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,670
I've done the math.
It checks out.

1127
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,920
<i>Rich.
Yes, sir.</i>

1128
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,036
Get out.

1129
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,120
All right.

1130
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,239
- Is he right?
- Yeah.

1131
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,517
Bruce, what do you think?

1132
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,600
<i>Well, if Vincent says so.</i>

1133
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,236
We need to use the <i>Taiyang Shen?</i>

1134
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,360
Uh-huh.

1135
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,557
What am I missing?
Why is that important?

1136
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:29,949
Because we can only do one.

1137
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:32,271
Send Watney enough food
to last till <i>Ares 4...</i>

1138
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,358
or send <i>Hermes</i> back
to get him right now.

1139
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,235
Both plans require
the <i>Taiyang Shen,</i>

1140
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,198
so we have to choose.

1141
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,074
But what about the <i>Hermes</i> crew?

1142
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:41,839
We'd be asking them to add

1143
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:45,038
533 extra days to their mission.

1144
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,119
Yeah. They wouldn't hesitate,
not for a second.

1145
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:49,913
Can the <i>Hermes</i> function
for 533 days

1146
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:51,275
beyond the scheduled
mission end?

1147
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:52,400
It should.

1148
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,392
Built to last
the full <i>Ares</i> mission...

1149
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,631
so technically, it's only
halfway through its lifespan.

1150
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:58,550
But if something goes wrong...

1151
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,120
Then we lose the crew.

1152
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,993
<i>So what?
We either have a high chance</i>

1153
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:03,839
<i>of killing one person...</i>

1154
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:06,555
<i>or a low chance
of killing six people.</i>

1155
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,080
<i>How do we make that decision?</i>

1156
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:10,072
We don't have to make it, Bruce.

1157
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:11,160
He does.

1158
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:12,636
Yeah, well, bullshit.

1159
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:14,998
It should be
Commander Lewis' call.

1160
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:16,719
We still have a chance to bring

1161
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,439
five astronauts
home safe and sound.

1162
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,159
I'm not risking their lives.

1163
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,959
Let them make that decision.

1164
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:26,354
Mitch, we're going
with option one.

1165
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:30,272
You goddamn coward.

1166
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,437
<i>Johanssen?
Yeah.</i>

1167
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:53,675
I know it's your private time.
Can I bother you for a second?

1168
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:54,800
<i>Yeah, go ahead.</i>

1169
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:55,920
<i>Where are you?</i>

1170
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:56,960
The gym.

1171
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,029
What's up?

1172
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:21,200
I just got an email from my wife

1173
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:24,233
and the subject line
says, "Our children."

1174
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,552
My computer won't open
the attachment.

1175
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,195
Okay.

1176
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:30,476
Let's take a look.

1177
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,550
Uh...

1178
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Let's see.

1179
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,357
This isn't a JPEG.

1180
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:45,155
It's a plain ASCII text file.

1181
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,275
I don't really know
what we're looking at.

1182
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,354
Does that make any sense to you?

1183
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:56,831
"Rich Purnell Maneuver."

1184
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,839
It's a course maneuver
for the <i>Hermes.</i>

1185
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,075
And the mission concludes
with Earth intercept,

1186
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,200
211 days later.

1187
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:11,960
Would it work?

1188
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:14,192
Mmm-hmm. We ran
the numbers. They check out.

1189
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:15,794
It's a brilliant course.

1190
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,754
So why all the cloak and dagger?

1191
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,718
Because it goes directly
against NASA's decision.

1192
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,837
Yeah. If we do
the maneuver,

1193
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:25,037
they'd have to send
the supply ship or we die.

1194
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:28,432
We have the opportunity
to force their hand.

1195
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,910
So, are we gonna do it?

1196
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,237
If it was up to me,
we'd already be on our way.

1197
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,471
But it is, though,
isn't it? Up to you.

1198
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:39,150
Not this time.

1199
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:42,279
This is something NASA
expressly rejected.

1200
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:44,873
We're talking about mutiny here,

1201
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,394
which is not a word
that I take lightly.

1202
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,120
So we do this together
or not at all.

1203
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,239
And before you answer,
consider the consequences.

1204
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:55,438
If we mess up the supply
rendezvous, we die.

1205
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:58,394
If we mess up the Earth
gravity assist, we die.

1206
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,638
If we do everything perfectly...

1207
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,918
we add 533 days to our mission.

1208
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:08,960
533 more days before
we see our families again.

1209
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:13,637
533 days of unplanned
space travel...

1210
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,359
where anything could go wrong.

1211
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,911
If it's mission
critical, we die.

1212
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:20,796
Sign me up.

1213
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,434
All right, cowboy, slow down.

1214
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,273
You and I, we're military.

1215
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:26,113
Chances are, we go home,
they'll court martial us.

1216
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:27,200
Yeah, there's that.

1217
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:28,396
And for the rest of you guys...

1218
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:31,393
I guarantee they will never
send you back up here again.

1219
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:35,952
Good. So, if we go
for it, how would it work?

1220
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,679
I plot the course
and execute it.

1221
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,115
Remote override.

1222
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,430
They could take over the <i>Hermes</i>

1223
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:41,789
from Mission Control.

1224
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,957
Can you disable it?

1225
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:47,191
<i>Hermes</i> has four redundant
flight computers...

1226
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,676
each connected to three
redundant comm systems.

1227
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,069
We can't shut down the comms

1228
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:52,674
because we'd lose
telemetry and guidance.

1229
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:54,399
And we can't shut down
the computers

1230
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,153
because we need to run the ship.

1231
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:59,631
I'd have to disable remote
override on each system.

1232
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,712
It's part of the OS, I'd have
to jump over the code.

1233
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:04,520
Okay, but, like, in English,
what would that mean?

1234
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:07,789
I can do it.

1235
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:09,876
Great.

1236
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,034
Well, it has to be unanimous.

1237
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:18,471
If we do this, it'll be
over 900 days of space.

1238
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:24,231
That's more than enough
space for one life...

1239
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:26,309
so, yes.

1240
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:28,194
I vote yes.

1241
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:32,034
Let's go get him.

1242
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:35,920
Johanssen?

1243
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:37,600
Yes.

1244
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,116
Yeah!

1245
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:44,355
Got an unscheduled status
update from <i>Hermes.</i>

1246
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:45,520
Roger. Read it out.

1247
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:48,354
Message reads,
"Houston, please be advised.

1248
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:50,352
"Rich Purnell
is a steely-eyed missile man."

1249
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:51,440
What?

1250
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,954
Flight, Guidance.

1251
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:54,918
<i>Hermes</i> is off-course.

1252
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,355
CAPCOM, advise <i>Hermes</i>
they're drifting.

1253
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:58,033
Guidance, get
a correction ready.

1254
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:59,200
Negative, Flight,

1255
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:00,879
it's not drift.
They've adjusted course.

1256
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:02,190
What the hell?

1257
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:05,592
Telemetry, any chance this is
instrumentation failure?

1258
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,240
Negative, Flight.

1259
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,510
Guidance, work at
how long they can stay

1260
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,114
on this course
before it's irreversible.

1261
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:11,873
Working on that now, Flight.

1262
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:13,440
Hey.
Who's Rich Purnell?

1263
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:15,280
I dunno.

1264
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:17,877
Will somebody find out
who the hell Rich Purnell is?

1265
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:20,557
Annie will go before
the media this morning...

1266
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:22,279
and inform them
of NASA's decision

1267
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,551
to reroute the <i>Hermes</i> to Mars.

1268
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,073
Sounds like a smart move.

1269
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:30,151
Considering the circumstances.

1270
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:35,472
Whoever gave them the maneuver
only passed along information.

1271
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:37,438
Crew made the decision
on their own.

1272
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:41,072
You may have killed them, Mitch.

1273
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:44,959
We're fighting the same war.

1274
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:46,554
Every time something goes wrong,

1275
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:48,233
the world forgets why we fly.

1276
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:49,999
I'm trying to keep us airborne.

1277
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:52,072
It's bigger than one person.

1278
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:55,315
No.

1279
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:56,760
It's not.

1280
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:01,630
When this is over,
I'll expect your resignation.

1281
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:06,270
I understand.

1282
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,956
Bring our astronauts home.

1283
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:14,880
Every <i>Ares</i> mission requires
three years of pre-supplies.

1284
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:17,600
So NASA decided a long time
ago it's a lot easier...

1285
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:18,995
to send some
of the stuff beforehand

1286
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:20,349
rather than bring it with us.

1287
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:24,196
So, as a result,
the MAV for <i>Ares 4...</i>

1288
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:25,430
is already there

1289
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,153
at the Schiaparelli Crater,
just waiting.

1290
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:31,309
So the plan is for me to use
that to go into orbit...

1291
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:34,479
just as the <i>Hermes</i> is passing...

1292
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:37,792
and I guess they catch me?

1293
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,513
In space.

1294
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:45,956
So, I've got 200 sols
to figure out...

1295
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:48,800
how to take everything here
that's keeping me alive...

1296
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,639
the oxygenator,
the water reclaimer,

1297
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:52,234
the atmospheric regulator...

1298
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,632
<i>bring that all with me.</i>

1299
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,235
<i>And luckily,
I have the greatest minds</i>

1300
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:58,470
<i>on Planet Earth...</i>

1301
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:01,712
<i>really, all of the brainpower
on the entire planet...</i>

1302
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,678
<i>helping me with this endeavor.</i>

1303
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,354
<i>And so far
they've come up with...</i>

1304
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:06,749
<i>"Hey, why don't you drill holes</i>

1305
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:07,990
<i>"on the roof of your Rover...</i>

1306
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:09,913
<i>"and hit it as hard as you can
with a rock?"</i>

1307
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:13,392
We're gonna get there.

1308
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,478
<i>Didn't know what time it was</i>

1309
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:38,792
<i>And the lights were low</i>

1310
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:42,078
<i>I leaned back on my radio</i>

1311
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,874
<i>Some cat was layin' down
some rock 'n' roll</i>

1312
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,360
<i>Lotta soul, he said</i>

1313
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,313
<i>Then the loud sound
did seem to fade</i>

1314
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:59,639
<i>Came back like a slow voice
on a wave of phase</i>

1315
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:05,034
<i>That weren't no DJ
That was hazy cosmic jive</i>

1316
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:12,754
<i>There's a starman
waiting in the sky</i>

1317
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:15,230
<i>533 days longer?</i>

1318
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,232
<i>And you said yes to this?</i>

1319
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:19,278
He would have done the same
for me. You know that.

1320
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,433
Cheese. You do "cheese"?

1321
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:28,596
Cheese.

1322
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,400
He didn't do "cheese."

1323
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:32,795
Did he do "cheese"?

1324
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:42,070
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

1325
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:43,200
Hey.

1326
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:44,919
<i>I got something for you.</i>

1327
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:46,514
<i>Found it in the flea market.</i>

1328
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:48,080
<i>Original pressing.</i>

1329
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:50,160
No!

1330
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:52,670
<i>Not a scratch.</i>

1331
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,115
I love it.

1332
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:57,432
All due respect
to your CNSA protocol...

1333
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:59,956
but we haven't
done things that way...

1334
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:01,873
since <i>Apollo 9.</i>

1335
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:04,520
Did he get that?

1336
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:14,558
<i>Look out your window
I can see his light</i>

1337
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:17,519
<i>If we can sparkle
He may land tonight</i>

1338
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:20,958
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

1339
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:25,040
Mmm-hmm.

1340
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:28,120
Oh!

1341
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:32,598
<i>There's a starman
waiting in the sky</i>

1342
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:35,749
<i>He'd like to come and meet us</i>

1343
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,559
<i>But he thinks
he'd blow our minds</i>

1344
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:41,077
<i>There's a starman
waiting in the sky</i>

1345
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:45,160
<i>He's told us not to blow it</i>

1346
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:47,197
<i>'Cause he knows
it's all worthwhile</i>

1347
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:50,472
<i>He told me
Let the children lose it</i>

1348
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:54,315
<i>Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie</i>

1349
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:59,033
<i>There's a starman
waiting in the sky</i>

1350
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,989
<i>He'd like to come and meet us</i>

1351
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,117
<i>But he thinks
he'd blow our minds</i>

1352
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:08,672
<i>There's a starman
waiting in the sky</i>

1353
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:11,032
<i>He's told us not to blow it</i>

1354
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:13,510
<i>'Cause he knows
it's all worthwhile</i>

1355
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:16,440
<i>He told me
Let the children lose it</i>

1356
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:18,874
<i>Let the children use it</i>

1357
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:22,195
<i>Let all the children boogie</i>

1358
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:41,199
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la</i>

1359
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,474
<i>I've been thinking
about laws on Mars.</i>

1360
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:19,355
<i>There's an international treaty</i>

1361
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:20,630
<i>saying no country
can lay claim...</i>

1362
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,200
<i>to anything that's not on Earth.</i>

1363
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:23,430
<i>And by another treaty,</i>

1364
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,477
<i>if you're not in any
country's territory...</i>

1365
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:26,790
<i>maritime law applies.</i>

1366
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,879
<i>So Mars is international waters.</i>

1367
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:33,997
<i>Now, NASA is an American
non-military organization.</i>

1368
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:35,160
<i>It owns the Hab.</i>

1369
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:37,994
<i>But the second I walk outside,
I'm in international waters.</i>

1370
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:39,480
<i>So here's the cool part.</i>

1371
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:41,194
<i>I'm about to leave for
the Schiaparelli Crater...</i>

1372
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,238
where I'm gonna commandeer
the <i>Ares 4</i> lander.

1373
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:46,438
Nobody explicitly gave me
permission to do this...

1374
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:48,592
<i>and they can't
until I'm on board the</i> Ares 4.

1375
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,356
<i>So that means I'm gonna be
taking a craft over...</i>

1376
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,716
<i>in international waters
without permission.</i>

1377
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:57,669
<i>Which, by definition,
makes me a pirate.</i>

1378
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:02,435
<i>Mark Watney, Space Pirate.</i>

1379
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:33,593
A Space Pirate.

1380
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:38,150
<i>Everywhere I go, I'm the first.</i>

1381
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:40,593
<i>It's a strange feeling.</i>

1382
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:42,839
<i>Step outside the Rover...</i>

1383
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,117
<i>first guy to be there.</i>

1384
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:48,432
<i>Climb that hill,
first guy to do that.</i>

1385
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:51,312
<i>Four and a half billion years...</i>

1386
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:53,159
<i>nobody here.</i>

1387
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:56,474
<i>And now, me.</i>

1388
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:01,316
<i>I'm the first person to be
alone on an entire planet.</i>

1389
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:17,834
How's he doing?

1390
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:21,199
So far, so good.

1391
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:23,511
He's sticking to schedule.

1392
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:26,155
Drives for four hours
before noon...

1393
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:28,035
lays the solar panels,

1394
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:29,913
waits 13 hours for them
to recharge...

1395
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:34,438
and sleeps somewhere in there
and then starts again.

1396
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:37,680
How's he doing?

1397
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:42,714
He asked us to call him
Captain Blondebeard.

1398
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:46,552
Well, technically, Mars
would be under maritime...

1399
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:48,200
Yeah, I know.
He explained it to us.

1400
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:51,280
Where is he?

1401
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:53,835
There.
Okay.

1402
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:55,160
Here.

1403
01:41:55,640 --> 01:41:56,640
Okay.

1404
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:43,436
<i>Okay, I'm gonna start
by stating for the record</i>

1405
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:44,874
<i>that you're not gonna like this.</i>

1406
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:46,316
Oh, yeah?

1407
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:49,600
Yeah, the problem
is the intercept velocity.

1408
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:54,357
The <i>Hermes,</i> well...
It can't enter Mars' orbit.

1409
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:57,797
Otherwise, they'll never have
enough fuel to make it home.

1410
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,071
The MAV, that was only designed

1411
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:02,470
to get to low Mars orbit.

1412
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:06,634
So in order for Mark to escape
Mars' gravity entirely...

1413
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:08,194
and to intercept the <i>Hermes...</i>

1414
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:10,113
He has to be going
fast. Exactly.

1415
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:12,511
<i>Which means we need to make
the MAV lighter.</i>

1416
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:15,189
<i>A lot lighter.
5,000 kilograms lighter.</i>

1417
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:16,596
You can do that, right?

1418
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:18,558
<i>There's some gimmes
right off the bat.</i>

1419
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:20,234
<i>The design presumes
500 kilograms</i>

1420
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:21,640
<i>of Martian soil and samples.</i>

1421
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,434
Obviously we won't do that.

1422
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:27,350
And there's just one
passenger instead of six.

1423
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:30,194
With suits and gear,
that's another 500?

1424
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:32,238
Ditch the life support,
don't need it.

1425
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:34,198
And we'll get Mark to wear
his EVA suit the whole trip.

1426
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:36,033
Wait a second.
If he's in his EVA suit,

1427
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:37,474
how is he gonna
operate the controls?

1428
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:39,711
Well, he won't.

1429
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:43,510
Martinez will pilot the MAV
remotely from the <i>Hermes.</i>

1430
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:46,275
We've never had a manned ship
controlled remotely before.

1431
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:50,150
But I am excited about

1432
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:52,232
the opportunities that affords.

1433
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,835
If we go remote, we can lose
the control panels,

1434
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:56,718
the secondary and tertiary
comm systems.

1435
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:57,916
<i>Wait a second.</i>

1436
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,914
<i>You want a remote-controlled
ascent with no backup comms?</i>

1437
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:06,680
He's not even got to
the bad stuff yet, Vincent.

1438
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:08,160
Let's skip to the bad stuff!

1439
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:10,392
We need to remove
the nose airlock,

1440
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:13,279
the windows, and Hull Panel 19.

1441
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,200
You want to take
the front of the ship off?

1442
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:17,476
<i>Sure.</i>

1443
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:20,030
<i>The nose airlock
alone is 400 kilograms.</i>

1444
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,869
You want to send
a man into space

1445
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
without the front of his ship?

1446
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:24,310
<i>Well, no.</i>

1447
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:28,472
<i>We're gonna have him cover it
with Hab canvas.</i>

1448
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:32,950
<i>Look, the hull's mostly there
to keep the air in.</i>

1449
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:34,634
Mars' atmosphere is so thin,

1450
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,074
you don't need
a lot of streamlining.

1451
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:37,879
By the time
the ship's going fast enough

1452
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:39,599
for air resistance to matter...

1453
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:42,195
it'll be high enough that
there's practically no air.

1454
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:44,920
You wanna send him into
space under a tarp.

1455
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:46,434
<i>Yes.</i>

1456
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:48,959
<i>Can I go on?</i>

1457
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:50,190
No.

1458
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:59,035
You think he means it like...

1459
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:00,793
"Are you kidding me?"

1460
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:02,276
You know?
Mmm-hmm.

1461
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:05,718
Or like, "Are you kidding me?"

1462
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:08,233
I think it might be
the second one.

1463
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:09,720
Really?
Uh-huh.

1464
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:11,440
Could be the first way.

1465
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:13,470
"Are you kidding me?"

1466
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:16,113
Yeah, it could be the first way.

1467
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:42,795
<i>I know what they're doing.</i>

1468
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,637
I know exactly
what they're doing.

1469
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:48,039
They just keep repeating...

1470
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:51,193
"Go faster than any man in
the history of space travel."

1471
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:52,516
<i>Like that's a good thing.</i>

1472
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:54,990
<i>Like it'll distract me from
how insane their plan is.</i>

1473
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:57,920
Yeah, I get to go
faster than any man

1474
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,992
in the history
of space travel...

1475
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:03,039
because you are launching me
in a convertible.

1476
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:04,839
Actually it's worse than that

1477
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:06,752
because I won't even be able
to control the thing.

1478
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:09,714
<i>And by the way, physicists,</i>

1479
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:12,520
<i>when describing things
like acceleration...</i>

1480
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:14,717
<i>do not use the word "fast."</i>

1481
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,671
So they're only doing that
in the hopes

1482
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:19,956
that I won't raise
any objections...

1483
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:23,077
to this lunacy.

1484
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:25,394
<i>Because I like the way</i>

1485
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:28,439
<i>"fastest man in the history
of space travel" sounds.</i>

1486
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:32,277
<i>I do like the way it sounds.</i>

1487
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:35,278
<i>I mean, I like it a lot.</i>

1488
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:39,877
<i>I'm not gonna tell them that.</i>

1489
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:46,996
<i>Okay.</i>

1490
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:50,393
<i>Let's do this.</i>

1491
01:47:56,160 --> 01:47:57,640
<i>My, my</i>

1492
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:01,800
<i>At Waterloo
Napoleon did surrender</i>

1493
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:03,760
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1494
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:09,959
<i>And I have met my destiny
in quite a similar way</i>

1495
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:16,832
<i>The history book on the shelf
is always repeating itself</i>

1496
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:21,000
<i>Waterloo</i>

1497
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:23,993
<i>I was defeated You won the war</i>

1498
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:26,674
Come on.

1499
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:30,431
<i>Waterloo, promise to
love you forevermore</i>

1500
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:36,877
<i>Waterloo
Couldn't escape if I wanted to</i>

1501
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:41,230
<i>Waterloo</i>

1502
01:48:41,320 --> 01:48:42,993
<i>Knowing my fate
is to be with you</i>

1503
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:46,115
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, Waterloo</i>

1504
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:49,635
<i>Finally facing my Waterloo</i>

1505
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:54,956
<i>My, my</i>

1506
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:58,840
<i>I tried to hold you back</i>

1507
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:00,639
<i>But you were stronger</i>

1508
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:02,280
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1509
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:07,797
<i>And now it seems my only
chance is giving up the fight</i>

1510
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:12,110
<i>And how could I ever refuse?</i>

1511
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:15,674
<i>I feel like I win when I lose</i>

1512
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:19,240
<i>Waterloo</i>

1513
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:22,400
<i>I was defeated You won the war</i>

1514
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:26,074
<i>Waterloo</i>

1515
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:29,109
<i>Promise to love you forevermore</i>

1516
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:32,160
<i>Waterloo</i>

1517
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:35,075
<i>Couldn't escape if I wanted to</i>

1518
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:39,276
<i>Waterloo</i>

1519
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:42,114
<i>Knowing my fate
is to be with you</i>

1520
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:44,712
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, Waterloo</i>

1521
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:48,355
<i>Finally facing my Waterloo</i>

1522
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:51,632
<i>Ooh, Waterloo</i>

1523
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:54,791
<i>Knowing my fate
is to be with you</i>

1524
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:58,752
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, Waterloo</i>

1525
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:23,153
<i>Beck, Vogel,
I want you guys in Airlock 2</i>

1526
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:24,560
<i>with the outer door open...</i>

1527
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:26,680
<i>- before the MAV even launches.
- Okay.</i>

1528
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:30,720
<i>Martinez flies the MAV,
Johanssen sysops the ascent.</i>

1529
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:32,439
<i>Once we hit intercept,</i>

1530
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:34,677
<i>it's Beck's job
to go get Watney.</i>

1531
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:35,760
We're ready.

1532
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,070
What's the intercept plan?

1533
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:40,350
We finished attaching the
tethers into one long line.

1534
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:42,512
It's 214 meters long.

1535
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:43,796
And I'll have the MMU,

1536
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:44,996
so moving around should be easy.

1537
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:47,312
How fast a relative velocity
can you handle?

1538
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:50,869
I can grab the MAV
at 5 meters per second.

1539
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:53,151
10 is like jumping
onto a moving train.

1540
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:55,198
So any more than that
and I might miss.

1541
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:57,272
Well, we may have some leeway.

1542
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:00,593
The launch takes 12 minutes.

1543
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:03,998
And it'll be 52 minutes
before intercept.

1544
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:06,556
Once Mark's engine shuts off...

1545
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:09,150
we'll know our intercept point
and velocity.

1546
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:10,834
Vogel, you're Beck's backup.

1547
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,674
Everything goes well, you pull
them on board with the tether.

1548
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:16,594
If anything goes wrong,
you go out after him.

1549
01:51:16,760 --> 01:51:17,830
Yep.

1550
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:18,920
Okay.

1551
01:51:21,240 --> 01:51:23,471
Let's go get our boy.

1552
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:26,751
There's a mood
of tension and anxiety here,

1553
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:28,160
outside Johnson Space Center.

1554
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:29,320
As you can see,

1555
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:31,710
many people
have gathered here...

1556
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:33,200
to see whether or not

1557
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:35,954
the mission to retrieve Mark
Watney will be a success.

1558
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:38,078
<i>They've had
some contact with him,</i>

1559
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:40,117
<i>but it hasn't been very much.</i>

1560
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:41,520
<i>We have to remind our viewers</i>

1561
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:43,273
<i>that we're watching this
as it unfolds.</i>

1562
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:45,233
<i>So we'll try
and keep you up-to-date</i>

1563
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:47,192
<i>as to what exactly is going on.</i>

1564
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:51,030
<i>Let's listen in to NASA making
contact with Mark Watney.</i>

1565
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:52,435
<i>Let's listen in.</i>

1566
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:01,396
If something goes wrong,
what can Mission Control do?

1567
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:03,957
Not a damn thing.

1568
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:06,278
It's all happening
12 light-minutes away...

1569
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:08,113
which means it takes
24 minutes for them

1570
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:10,157
to get the answer to any
question they ask.

1571
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:13,317
The whole launch
is 12 minutes...

1572
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:16,679
so they're on their own.

1573
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:22,880
<i>...just how long
Mark has been</i>

1574
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,070
<i>completely alone on Mars.</i>

1575
01:54:24,160 --> 01:54:27,119
<i>We're talking to a psychology
expert later to discuss...</i>

1576
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:51,473
<i>Fuel pressure, green.</i>

1577
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:53,991
Engine alignment, perfect.

1578
01:54:54,160 --> 01:54:55,435
<i>Communications, five by five.</i>

1579
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:59,954
<i>We are ready for pre-flight
checklist, Commander.</i>

1580
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:02,720
<i>Mission Control,
this is</i> Hermes <i>actual.</i>

1581
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:04,792
<i>We will proceed on schedule.</i>

1582
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,992
<i>We are T-minus 2 minutes,
10 seconds</i>

1583
01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:08,480
<i>to launch, by the mark.</i>

1584
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:10,720
About two minutes, Watney.

1585
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:11,990
<i>How you doing down there?</i>

1586
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:13,355
I'm good.

1587
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:15,998
I'm anxious to get up to you.

1588
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:17,874
Thanks for coming back for me.

1589
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:18,960
<i>Well, we're on it.</i>

1590
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:20,839
<i>Remember, you'll be pulling
some serious G's,</i>

1591
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:22,593
<i>so it's okay to pass out.</i>

1592
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:24,717
You're in Martinez's hands now.

1593
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:27,471
Well, tell that asshole
no barrel rolls.

1594
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:30,195
Copy that, MAV.

1595
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:31,680
<i>CAPCOM.</i>

1596
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:32,800

<i>Go.</i>

1607
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:46,956
<i>Copy. We're go.</i>

1608
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:50,476
<i>Mission Control,
we are go for launch.</i>

1609
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:52,515
T-minus ten...

1610
01:55:52,640 --> 01:55:53,640
nine...

1611
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:54,680
Main engine start.

1612
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:55,996

<i>Mooring clamps released.</i>

1615
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:00,913
About five seconds, Watney.
Hang on.

1616
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:02,753
I'll see you in a few,
Commander.

1617
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:04,360
<i>four...</i>

1618
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:06,035

01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:07,515
<i>two...</i>

1620
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:08,956
<i>one.</i>

1621
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:47,630
Velocity, 741 meters per second.

1622
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:49,757
Altitude, 1350 meters.

1623
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:51,070
That's too low.

1624
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:52,390
It's fighting me.

1625
01:56:56,240 --> 01:56:59,472
<i>Watney, do you read?</i>

1626
01:57:05,480 --> 01:57:06,755
<i>Booster separation complete.</i>

1627
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:09,958
Velocity, 850.
Altitude, 1843.

1628
01:57:10,160 --> 01:57:11,355
He's well below target altitude.

1629
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:12,749
How far below?

1630
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:14,350
Checking.

1631
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:16,155
Watney.

1632
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:17,800
Do you read?

1633
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:19,275
<i>He's probably passed out.</i>

1634
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:20,590
<i>He pulled 12 g's on the ascent.</i>

1635
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:21,949
<i>Give him a few minutes.</i>

1636
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:23,270
<i>Copy that.</i>

1637
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:26,960
<i>Main shutdown in three...</i>

1638
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:29,199
<i>two, one...</i>

1639
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:30,990
<i>shutdown.</i>

1640
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:34,040
<i>Back to automatic guidance.</i>

1641
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,354
<i>Shutdown confirmed.</i>

1642
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:40,593
<i>Fuel reserves depleted.</i>

1643
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:43,670
<i>Watney?</i>

1644
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:45,475
<i>Do you read?</i>

1645
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:47,675
<i>It seems there's some
sort of problem</i>

1646
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:49,160
<i>with the transmission.</i>

1647
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:57,879
<i>I have interval pings.</i>

1648
01:57:58,040 --> 01:58:00,077
Intercept velocity will be
11 meters per second.

1649
01:58:00,240 --> 01:58:01,993
I can make that work.

1650
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:04,956
Distance at intercept will be...

1651
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:07,073
We'll be 68 kilometers apart.

1652
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:09,318
<i>68 kilometers?</i>

1653
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:11,995
<i>Did she just say 68 kilometers?</i>

1654
01:58:12,760 --> 01:58:13,760
Come on, guys, keep it together.

1655
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:14,876
Work the problem.

1656
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:17,153
Johanssen, time to intercept?

1657
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:19,832
<i>39 minutes, 12 seconds.</i>

1658
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:22,000
Martinez, what if we
point our thrusters

1659
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:23,230
in the same direction?

1660
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:26,639
Well, it depends how much fuel
you wanna save...

1661
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:28,154
for the altitude adjustments
for the trip home.

1662
01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:29,390
How much do you need?

1663
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:33,839
I can get by with about 20%
of what we have left.

1664
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:38,152
If we use 75.5% of remaining
altitude-adjust fuel...

1665
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:40,198
that will bring the intercept
range to zero.

1666
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:41,320
Do it.

1667
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:45,358
Hang on. It brings
the range to zero...

1668
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:48,240
but the intercept velocity
will be 42 meters per second.

1669
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:50,039
<i>And that's way too fast.</i>

1670
01:58:50,440 --> 01:58:52,432
Then we'll have 39 minutes
to figure out

1671
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:54,074
how to slow down.

1672
01:58:57,160 --> 01:58:58,913
Martinez, burn the jets.

1673
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:00,480
Copy that.

1674
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:24,957
MAV to <i>Hermes.</i>

1675
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:26,040
<i>Watney?</i>

1676
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:27,160
<i>Affirmative.</i>

1677
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:32,634
<i>What's your status?</i>

1678
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,514
<i>My chest hurts.</i>

1679
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:36,394
<i>I broke my ribs.</i>

1680
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:38,310
<i>How are you?</i>

1681
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:39,590
<i>We're working on getting to you.</i>

1682
01:59:39,680 --> 01:59:41,160
<i>There was a complication
during launch.</i>

1683
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:42,714
Copy that.

1684
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:44,714
How bad is it?

1685
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:46,439
<i>We've corrected
the intercept range,</i>

1686
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:48,477
<i>but we've got a problem
with intercept velocity.</i>

1687
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:49,915
<i>How big a problem?</i>

1688
01:59:50,120 --> 01:59:51,600
42 meters a second.

1689
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:52,960
Well...

1690
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:55,714
shit.

1691
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:02,438
<i>Commander, I have an idea.</i>

1692
02:00:02,600 --> 02:00:04,034
<i>Go ahead, Mark.</i>

1693
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:07,352
Well, if I can find
something sharp in here...

1694
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:10,354
and poke a hole in the glove
of my EVA suit...

1695
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:12,989
I could use the escaping air
as a thruster...

1696
02:00:13,160 --> 02:00:14,560
<i>and fly towards you.</i>

1697
02:00:14,720 --> 02:00:17,758
<i>It would be easy to control
because it would be on my arm.</i>

1698
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:19,872
I can't see you having
any control if you did that.

1699
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:21,838
You'd be eyeballing
the intercept

1700
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:24,196
using a thrust vector
you can barely control.

1701
02:00:24,440 --> 02:00:27,592
Yes, those are all
very good points.

1702
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:31,154
But consider this.

1703
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:35,840
I'd get to fly around
like Iron Man.

1704
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:38,719
<i>Commander...</i>

1705
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:40,553
<i>let's go Iron Man.</i>

1706
02:00:43,640 --> 02:00:44,915
<i>This is unexpected LOS.</i>

1707
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:47,038
<i>Communication lost. Stand by.</i>

1708
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:50,720
Maybe it's not the worst idea.

1709
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:52,712
No, it is the worst idea.
It's the worst idea ever.

1710
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:53,996
Not what he said.

1711
02:00:54,160 --> 02:00:56,277
Using atmosphere as thrust.

1712
02:00:58,520 --> 02:01:00,432
What happens if we blow the VAL?

1713
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:02,518
Wait, you want to open
the vehicular airlock?

1714
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:03,830
It'll give us a good kick.

1715
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,753
But also blow
the nose off the ship.

1716
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:08,719
And all the air would leave
and we need air to not die.

1717
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:11,111
We would seal the bridge
and the reactor room.

1718
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:12,549
Everywhere else would go vacuo.

1719
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:14,200
Vogel.

1720
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:15,555
<i>Go ahead, Commander.</i>

1721
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:18,600
I need you to come inside
and make a... bomb.

1722
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,360
Again, Commander?

1723
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:21,400
<i>You're a chemist.</i>

1724
02:01:21,480 --> 02:01:23,312
<i>Can you make a bomb with
what you have on board?</i>

1725
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,275
Probably.

1726
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:28,635
But I feel obliged to mention

1727
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:30,513
that setting off
an explosive device...

1728
02:01:30,720 --> 02:01:33,440
<i>in a spacecraft
is a terrible, terrible idea.</i>

1729
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:36,679
Hang on. You guys making
a bomb without me?

1730
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:38,832
<i>Copy that.
Can you do it?</i>

1731
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:42,240
<i>Ja.</i>

1732
02:01:45,160 --> 02:01:46,753
<i>Houston, be advised.</i>

1733
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:48,400
<i>We are going to deliberately
breach the VAL</i>

1734
02:01:48,480 --> 02:01:49,994
<i>to produce a reverse thrust.</i>

1735
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:53,630
Beck, leave your suit on.
Meet Johanssen in Airlock 1.

1736
02:01:53,800 --> 02:01:54,836
We'll open the outer door.

1737
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,673
<i>I need you to place the charge
on the inner door.</i>

1738
02:01:57,160 --> 02:01:59,277
<i>Climb back to Airlock 2

1739

Copy. I'm on my way.

1740
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:10,000
I'm in, Commander.

1741
02:02:10,160 --> 02:02:11,196
<i>Copy that.</i>

1742
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:21,953
Vogel, where are you?

1743
02:02:22,120 --> 02:02:23,156
<i>I'm in the kitchen.</i>

1744
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:24,320
Okay.

1745
02:02:28,360 --> 02:02:29,360
<i>Commander...</i>

1746
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:31,398
I can't let you
go through with this.

1747
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:33,119
I am prepared to cut the suit.

1748
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:34,476
Absolutely not.

1749
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:37,030
<i>See, the thing is, I'm selfish.</i>

1750
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:40,159
I want all the memorials back
home to be about me.

1751
02:02:40,240 --> 02:02:41,240
<i>Just me.</i>

1752
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:43,636
I should have left
this guy on Mars.

1753
02:02:43,960 --> 02:02:44,996
Hey.

1754
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:48,880
Sugar?

1755
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:49,960
Yeah.

1756
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:55,480
Can you hold this?

1757
02:02:56,080 --> 02:02:57,799
Liquid oxygen...

1758
02:02:57,960 --> 02:03:01,431
and some stain remover
that contains ammonia.

1759
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:08,237
This thing here
is five times stronger

1760
02:03:08,320 --> 02:03:09,754
than a stick of dynamite.

1761
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:11,069
How do we activate it?

1762
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:13,994
Can you connect this to
one of our lighting panels?

1763
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:18,835
Careful.

1764
02:03:25,400 --> 02:03:26,914
Open Airlock 1.

1765
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:33,949
I'm on the way to Beck.

1766
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:40,078
Let's just hope
this is a good idea, guys.

1767
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:41,196
It is.

1768
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:42,475
<i>Open A 1.</i>

1769
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:48,840
Hi.
Hey.

1770
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:54,034
You got it?
Mmm.

1771
02:03:59,680 --> 02:04:02,320
Make sure you're not in here
when this thing goes off.

1772
02:04:04,120 --> 02:04:05,315
Hey.

1773
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:07,312
Be careful out there.

1774
02:04:07,480 --> 02:04:08,630
In space.

1775
02:04:12,720 --> 02:04:15,110
Don't tell anyone I did that.

1776
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:26,036
Bomb set.

1777
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:37,156
Leaving Airlock 1.

1778
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:43,236
Guys, I'm running the numbers,

1779
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:44,470
and even with
optimal VAL blow...

1780
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:46,319
we're gonna be off on our angle.

1781
02:04:46,640 --> 02:04:49,314
What's the intercept
distance? Johanssen?

1782
02:04:49,480 --> 02:04:51,790
260 meters, approximate.

1783
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:53,275
That's too far.

1784
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:03,595
Commander?

1785
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:05,638
Martinez, close the door.

1786
02:05:09,120 --> 02:05:10,440
Open D3.

1787
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:12,792

02:05:41,480 --> 02:05:43,153

1791
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:52,435
15 seconds.

1792
02:05:52,680 --> 02:05:54,717
We sure know
how to cut it close.

1793
02:05:55,640 --> 02:05:56,676
Commander?

1794
02:05:56,760 --> 02:05:58,717
Distance is too far.
I'm going out.

1795
02:05:59,320 --> 02:06:00,320
I can do this.

1796
02:06:00,440 --> 02:06:01,440
It's not a debate.

1797
02:06:01,560 --> 02:06:03,074
I'm not risking
another crew member.

1798
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:05,000
Beck's returned.

1799
02:06:05,200 --> 02:06:06,953
Johanssen, initiate the bomb.

1800
02:06:07,320 --> 02:06:08,436
Ten seconds.

1801
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:09,640

Bridge seal holding.

1808
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:43,396
What's the damage?

1809
02:06:43,560 --> 02:06:44,710
<i>Worry about that later.</i>

1810
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:46,439
<i>What's the relative velocity?</i>

1811
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:47,670
12 meters per second.

1812
02:06:48,120 --> 02:06:49,120
<i>Copy.</i>

1813
02:06:51,680 --> 02:06:52,680
Hook me up.

1814
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:55,635
Done.

1815
02:07:05,560 --> 02:07:07,313
I have visual on the MAV.

1816
02:07:08,720 --> 02:07:10,313
<i>What's the intercept range?</i>

1817
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:11,869
I'm checking.

1818
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:14,274
312 meters.

1819
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:16,790
Did you say 312?

1820
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:19,475
Great. I'll wave at you guys
as I go by.

1821
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:23,920
Oh!

1822
02:07:28,600 --> 02:07:30,671
I can't get to you, Mark.
You're too far.

1823
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:31,800
<i>I'm not gonna make it.</i>

1824
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:32,880
I know.

1825
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:34,440
<i>Beck, unhook me.
I'm going after him.</i>

1826
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,469
Commander, I got this.

1827
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:52,914
Mark, report.

1828
02:07:53,160 --> 02:07:54,753
On my way, Commander.

1829
02:07:55,160 --> 02:07:56,230
Damn it.

1830
02:08:06,080 --> 02:08:08,356
Johanssen, what's my relative
velocity to Mark?

1831
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:10,398
5.2 meters per second.

1832
02:08:10,640 --> 02:08:12,199

1833
02:08:17,960 --> 02:08:19,679
<i>3. 1 meters

<i>Distance to target, 24 meters.</i>

1835
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:28,152
11 meters to target.

1836
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:32,040
<i>Six meters.</i>

1837
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:44,590
Hold on, Mark.

1838
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:13,560
I got him.

1839
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:17,755
<i>I got him.</i>

1840
02:09:18,680 --> 02:09:19,716
<i>I got him.</i>

1841
02:09:20,080 --> 02:09:21,673
Way to go, Iron Man.

1842
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:26,035
Beck, pull us in.

1843
02:09:29,240 --> 02:09:30,754
It's good to see you.

1844
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:33,676
You...

1845
02:09:35,480 --> 02:09:38,757
have terrible taste in music.

1846
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:50,512
<i>Houston, this is</i> Hermes <i>actual.</i>

1847
02:09:50,640 --> 02:09:51,640
<i>We got him.</i>

1848
02:09:53,720 --> 02:09:55,074
<i>Watney is secure.</i>

1849
02:10:00,360 --> 02:10:02,477
Contact in outer
space with Mark Watney.

1850
02:10:02,640 --> 02:10:04,632
<i>After a very long time,

<i>Mission confirmation:</i>

02:10:08,240 --> 02:10:10,630
<i>Mark Watney has been

1854
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:16,233
Grab a hold of him.

1855
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:19,435
Hey, handsome!

1856
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:21,239
Beck, close the hatch.

1857
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:25,760
Hey, guys!

1858
02:10:30,480 --> 02:10:32,597
<i>Houston, six crew safely aboard.</i>

1859
02:10:37,040 --> 02:10:40,112
<i>This is huge moment for
this nation, for the world...</i>

1860
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:43,398
<i>and indeed, for
international space travel.</i>

1861
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:45,752
I can't believe
anything you do works.

1862
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:47,630
Hey!

1863
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:50,800
Oh, God.

1864
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:52,473
I can't believe it.

1865
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:55,194
There's a little smell
going on over there, bud.

1866
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:58,717
I know. I haven't had a shower
in a year and a half.

1867
02:10:59,120 --> 02:11:01,476
Don't make me laugh,
I have broken ribs.

1868
02:11:35,560 --> 02:11:36,710
Hey, there.

1869
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:47,237
Morning, sir.
It's an honor, sir.

1870
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:48,400
Sir.

1871
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:50,833
Sir.
Sir.

1872
02:11:51,080 --> 02:11:52,196
Morning, sir.

1873
02:12:14,160 --> 02:12:16,152
<i>Welcome to the
Astronaut Candidate Program.</i>

1874
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:18,713
Now pay attention,

1875
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:20,439
because this could
save your life.

1876
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:22,673
Trust me, I know
what I'm talking about.

1877
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:25,911
Let me get a few things out
of the way, right off the bat.

1878
02:12:26,120 --> 02:12:29,670
Yes, I did in fact survive
on a deserted planet

1879
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:31,797
by farming in my own shit.

1880
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:35,475
Yes, it's actually worse
than it sounds.

1881
02:12:35,560 --> 02:12:37,313
So let's not talk
about that ever again.

1882
02:12:38,720 --> 02:12:41,679
The other question I get
most frequently is...

1883
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:44,230
"When I was up there,
stranded by myself...

1884
02:12:44,560 --> 02:12:46,870
"did I think
I was going to die?"

1885
02:12:47,400 --> 02:12:48,914
Yes, absolutely.

1886
02:12:50,080 --> 02:12:51,400
And that's what you need
to know going in

1887
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:53,119
because it's going
to happen to you.

1888
02:12:53,560 --> 02:12:56,917
This is space.
It does not cooperate.

1889
02:12:57,280 --> 02:13:00,000
At some point, everything is
going to go south on you.

1890
02:13:00,200 --> 02:13:01,316
Everything is going to go south

1891
02:13:01,400 --> 02:13:02,880
and you're going to say,
"This is it.

1892
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:04,839
"This is how I end."

1893
02:13:06,240 --> 02:13:07,754
Now, you can either
accept that...

1894
02:13:08,320 --> 02:13:10,312
or you can get to work.

1895
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:13,079
That's all it is.

1896
02:13:13,240 --> 02:13:15,072
You just begin.

1897
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:18,913
You do the math.
You solve one problem...

1898
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:20,594
then you solve the next one.

1899
02:13:20,840 --> 02:13:21,840
And then the next.

1900
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:23,076
And if you solve
enough problems,

1901
02:13:23,160 --> 02:13:24,799
you get to come home.

1902
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:27,591
All right, questions?

1903
02:13:32,680 --> 02:13:34,034
<i>Once Mission Control completes</i>

1904
02:13:34,120 --> 02:13:35,190
<i>their pre-flight checks...</i>

1905
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:37,158
<i>we'll begin launch procedures.</i>

1906
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:39,875
<i>The</i> Ares 5 <i>team will
rendezvous with the</i> Hermes...

1907
02:13:40,040 --> 02:13:42,680
approximately 48 minutes
after launch.

1908
02:13:43,320 --> 02:13:45,312
From there,
they will have 414 days

1909
02:13:45,400 --> 02:13:47,119
of space travel ahead of them.

1910
02:13:47,280 --> 02:13:48,396
<i>Have the goals changed</i>

1911
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:49,994
<i>from the previous mission...</i>

1912
02:13:50,160 --> 02:13:51,389
<i>to the</i> Ares 5 <i>program?</i>

1913
02:13:51,560 --> 02:13:53,392
<i>And what do you hope to
achieve this time around?</i>

1914
02:13:53,560 --> 02:13:55,358
<i>Well, no. The goals
have always been the same</i>

1915
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:56,920
for the <i>Ares</i> program.

1916
02:13:57,840 --> 02:13:59,194
This time, of course,
we hope to bring

1917
02:13:59,280 --> 02:14:00,509
all the astronauts
back at the same time.

1918
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:02,800
Flight, Guidance check complete.

1919
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:03,880
Copy, Guidance.

1920
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:06,680
This is Flight.

1921
02:14:06,840 --> 02:14:08,354
We are go for launch,
on schedule.

1922
02:14:19,560 --> 02:14:20,630
<i>Final aerosurface</i>

1923
02:14:20,720 --> 02:14:21,836
<i>checks are complete...</i>

1924
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,959
<i>as everything remains a go
for the launch of the</i> Ares 5.

1925
02:14:25,680 --> 02:14:26,909
<i>20 seconds.</i>

1926
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:30,073
<i>Proceeding with the count.</i>

1927
02:14:30,160 --> 02:14:32,436
<i>T-minus 10... 9...</i>

1928
02:14:32,760 --> 02:14:34,035
<i>Main engine start.</i>

1929
02:14:34,200 --> 02:14:37,557
<i>7... 6... 5... 4...</i>

1930
02:14:38,160 --> 02:14:41,471
<i>three... two... one.</i>

1931
02:14:41,640 --> 02:14:45,316
<i>And liftoff.
As the crew of the</i> Ares 5...

1932
02:14:45,480 --> 02:14:49,156
<i>begin the next chapter
of American space exploration.</i>

1933
02:14:49,360 --> 02:14:50,760
<i>Pressures look good.</i>

1934
02:15:09,240 --> 02:15:10,799
Wow. Good shot.

1935
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:12,076
<i>There you have it.</i>

1936
02:15:12,160 --> 02:15:14,550
<i>Five years after the rescue
of astronaut Mark Watney...</i>

1937
02:15:14,720 --> 02:15:17,792
<i>an</i> Ares 5 <i>is on its way to Mars.</i>

1938
02:16:10,760 --> 02:16:12,194
<i>First I was afraid</i>

1939
02:16:12,280 --> 02:16:13,919
<i>I was petrified</i>

1940
02:16:14,160 --> 02:16:17,995
<i>Kept thinking I could never
live without you by my side</i>

1941
02:16:18,240 --> 02:16:20,436
<i>But then I spent so many nights</i>

1942
02:16:20,520 --> 02:16:22,557
<i>Thinking how you did me wrong</i>

1943
02:16:22,640 --> 02:16:26,759
<i>And I grew strong
and I learned how to get along</i>

1944
02:16:26,840 --> 02:16:30,072
<i>And so you're back
from outer space</i>

1945
02:16:30,480 --> 02:16:32,312
<i>I just walked in
to find you here</i>

1946
02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:34,437
<i>With that sad look
upon your face</i>

1947
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:36,990
<i>I should have changed
that stupid lock</i>

1948
02:16:37,080 --> 02:16:38,753
<i>I should have made you
leave your key</i>

1949
02:16:38,960 --> 02:16:41,077
<i>If I had known
for just one second</i>

1950
02:16:41,160 --> 02:16:42,913
<i>You'd be back to bother me</i>

1951
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:46,437
<i>Boy, now go, walk out the door</i>

1952
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:51,353
<i>Just turn around now 'cause
you're not welcome anymore</i>

1953
02:16:52,280 --> 02:16:55,318
<i>Weren't you the one who tried
to hurt me with goodbye?</i>

1954
02:16:55,400 --> 02:16:57,039
<i>Did you think I'd crumble?</i>

1955
02:16:57,680 --> 02:16:59,273
<i>Did you think
I'd lay down and die?</i>

1956
02:16:59,360 --> 02:17:03,149
<i>Oh, no, not I I will survive</i>

1957
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:06,160
<i>For as long as
I know how to love</i>
