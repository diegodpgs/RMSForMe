1
00:00:58,567 --> 00:01:03,641
Couldn't you have talked sooner?

2
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:16,206
-So, he's talked, has he?
-Does he know where Alì's hidden?

3
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:19,197
I reckon so. Let's go see.

4
00:01:20,127 --> 00:01:21,560
Give him some coffee.

5
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:26,326
-Did you make him sing, Marc?
-Yeah.

6
00:01:28,927 --> 00:01:31,647
Come on, drink up. It'll do you good.

7
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:33,763
Buck up.

8
00:01:38,527 --> 00:01:40,119
Come on, stand up.

9
00:01:42,807 --> 00:01:44,957
Don't crowd him. Give him room.

10
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:47,567
At ease.

11
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:49,167
-Is it true?
-I reckon so.

12
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:51,761
-3, Rue des Abderames.
-Dress him.

13
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:58,084
Come on, it's all over now.
I assure you.

14
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:00,764
Can you stand?

15
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:02,559
Leave him alone.

16
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,516
Put it on.

17
00:02:11,487 --> 00:02:13,364
It's for your own good.

18
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:18,360
They'll not recognize you like this
in the Kasbah.

19
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:23,247
Come on, then you can go.
And we'll look after you.

20
00:02:23,247 --> 00:02:25,203
Here's a cap.

21
00:02:25,887 --> 00:02:29,197
-Now you're nationalised.
-Idiot.

22
00:02:36,367 --> 00:02:38,085
Let's go.

23
00:02:41,807 --> 00:02:43,877
No!

24
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:47,367
Pig-head, let's not start again!

25
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:52,122
Behave or you'll make me look a fool.

26
00:05:47,207 --> 00:05:49,960
Alì la Pointe,
the house is surrounded.

27
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:51,846
It's useless.

28
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:56,797
Surrender!
Let the boy and the girl come out.

29
00:05:57,767 --> 00:05:59,837
Then you, and the other.

30
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:03,597
Leave your weapons there.

31
00:06:04,727 --> 00:06:06,638
No tricks now.

32
00:06:06,687 --> 00:06:08,727
We've got you covered.

33
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:11,525
You wouldn't have time. Understand?

34
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:15,161
Can you hear me?

35
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:18,166
Listen,

36
00:06:18,287 --> 00:06:21,087
you're the last.
There's no one else left.

37
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:23,123
The organisation's finished.

38
00:06:23,887 --> 00:06:26,327
Everyone's dead, or in prison.

39
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:28,795
You'll have a proper trial.

40
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:30,879
Surrender!

41
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,766
National Liberation Front (FLN).
Communiquè N.1 .

42
00:07:06,847 --> 00:07:10,647
The time has arrived to emerge
from the long night,

43
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:13,487
and from the misery we have suffered

44
00:07:13,487 --> 00:07:16,206
under 130 years
of colonial oppression.

45
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:18,367
The battle draws nigh.

46
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:21,006
The aim is independence.

47
00:07:21,647 --> 00:07:24,167
To avoid a bloody conflict,

48
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:28,524
we propose honourable discussions

49
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:33,246
with the French recognizing our right
to self-government.

50
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:35,887
Algerians, unite!

51
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:37,366
Be prepared!

52
00:07:37,687 --> 00:07:40,645
The National Liberation Front
calls you to arms.

53
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:43,760
The king loses, the queen wins.
Place your bets.

54
00:07:44,287 --> 00:07:47,085
This one wins, this one loses.
The king loses, the queen wins.

55
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:52,127
Place your bets! Watch!
The king loses, the queen wins.

56
00:07:52,127 --> 00:07:55,727
Watch! The king loses, the queen wins.

57
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:59,436
Where's the king? Place your bets!

58
00:07:59,807 --> 00:08:02,719
-Yes, that one!
-You've lost.

59
00:08:07,407 --> 00:08:08,726
Yes, that one!

60
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:37,235
Get the rat! Kill him!

61
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:40,399
Stop it! Leave him alone!

62
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,207
Get back to the Kasbah!

63
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:45,367
Kill the rat!

64
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:48,447
Murderer!

65
00:08:48,447 --> 00:08:54,363
Kill the rat!

66
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,558
Omar Alì, alias Alì la Pointe.

67
00:08:57,607 --> 00:08:59,727
Born in Miliana on the 1st March 1930.

68
00:08:59,727 --> 00:09:01,647
Educational standard: illiterate.

69
00:09:01,647 --> 00:09:05,686
Occupation: labourer, farm hand,
boxer, presently unemployed.

70
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:07,480
Previous record:

71
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:12,323
1942 - Orano Juvenile Court:
reformatory for vandalism.

72
00:09:12,727 --> 00:09:15,844
1944 - two years' reformatory
for theft.

73
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:18,487
1 949 - Algiers Assizes -

74
00:09:18,487 --> 00:09:22,082
8 months for living off immoral
earnings and resisting arrest.

75
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:23,966
Persistent offender.

76
00:10:55,207 --> 00:10:57,880
They're going to execute an Algerian.

77
00:10:58,007 --> 00:11:03,167
A patriot. Come on, all together.
Yell: Long Live Algeria!

78
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:05,078
Here he is.

79
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:07,566
Silence.

80
00:12:00,927 --> 00:12:04,397
Five months later.

81
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:51,005
-Beat it!
-Men have two faces.

82
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:54,565
-They've sent you?
-You're displeased?

83
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,198
It's all written here.

84
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:02,120
Come here.

85
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:05,927
-Can you read?
-Of course.

86
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:08,646
-Read it.
-Here?

87
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:15,085
There's a Moorish cafè
at 40, Rue Randon.

88
00:13:15,687 --> 00:13:19,805
Madjebri, the owner,
is a police informer.

89
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:26,567
Every day at five a French cop
stops by a moment,

90
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:30,647
and picks up information
pretending to have a cup of tea.

91
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:32,447
Kill the cop.

92
00:13:32,447 --> 00:13:33,887
Not Madjebri?

93
00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:36,082
It says the cop.

94
00:13:36,887 --> 00:13:38,047
Okay.

95
00:13:38,047 --> 00:13:42,727
At the corner under the clock,

96
00:13:42,727 --> 00:13:45,287
you'll see a girl with a basket.

97
00:13:46,047 --> 00:13:49,562
When the cop comes out,
you both follow him.

98
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:53,803
At the right moment
she'll give you a gun,

99
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,367
and you shoot.

100
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:58,642
Immediately. In the back.

101
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:20,080
Wait, what do you think you're doing?

102
00:14:20,607 --> 00:14:21,676
Stop!

103
00:14:22,607 --> 00:14:25,447
I give the orders now.
Put your arms up!

104
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:29,326
Look brothers! See our masters now.

105
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:56,164
Louse! Scum!

106
00:15:02,287 --> 00:15:04,327
Now, explain.

107
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:06,247
Let's get clear first.

108
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:08,687
Who sent the letter?

109
00:15:08,687 --> 00:15:12,077
-He's waiting.
-Let's go, if we can make it.

110
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:32,440
Move. You go first, I'll follow.

111
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:41,276
-I had to know if you were a spy.
-With an empty gun?

112
00:15:41,727 --> 00:15:44,719
Let's suppose you were a spy.

113
00:15:45,287 --> 00:15:48,207
The FLN contact you in prison,

114
00:15:48,207 --> 00:15:51,727
you pretend to be for the cause
and the French let you go.

115
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:54,967
-Shooting at me?
-It could be fixed.

116
00:15:54,967 --> 00:16:00,724
You escape, go to the address you
received in prison and get to know me.

117
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:05,398
-What's your name?
-Kader. Saari Kader.

118
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:10,327
To join the organisation
you had to do a job.

119
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:13,127
I could have told you
to kill the barman.

120
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:18,201
But he's an Algerian and the police
would have let you kill him even though he's a stool.

121
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:22,127
And you could have spied on us.

122
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:24,887
That's why I said to kill the cop.

123
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:27,727
Because the French
wouldn't have allowed it.

124
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:31,927
If you were one of them,
you wouldn't have done it.

125
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:35,647
-I didn't.
-You couldn't.

126
00:16:35,647 --> 00:16:40,767
-You tried, that's the important thing.
-And nearly got caught.

127
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:44,527
Now, now... you're exaggerating.

128
00:16:44,527 --> 00:16:48,607
Your orders were, shoot in the back.

129
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,563
Don't grumble.

130
00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:53,607
Why didn't you let me kill him?

131
00:16:53,607 --> 00:16:55,837
We're not ready yet.

132
00:16:56,647 --> 00:17:00,322
We need a safe hide-out.

133
00:17:03,207 --> 00:17:07,883
There's the Kasbah. It's still not safe.

134
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:12,636
Too many drunks, whores, junkies.

135
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:16,642
People who talk too much, ready
to sell us out, they're uncommitted.

136
00:17:17,607 --> 00:17:19,607
We must convince them
or eliminate them.

137
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:23,316
Clean up the Kasbah.

138
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,357
Then think about the French.

139
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:31,727
April 1 956.

140
00:17:31,727 --> 00:17:34,887
FLN Communiquè N. 24.
Brothers of the Kasbah,

141
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,163
the Colonial Administration is
responsible not only for our misery,

142
00:17:38,647 --> 00:17:43,084
but also for our brothers' vices
which make them lose their dignity.

143
00:17:43,607 --> 00:17:48,123
Corruption and degradation
are the weapons of colonialism.

144
00:17:48,847 --> 00:17:54,367
The FLN calls on the people to prepare
physically and morally

145
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:57,359
so as to gain independence.

146
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:02,678
To this end,
the FLN has decided to prohibit:

147
00:18:03,087 --> 00:18:05,567
gambling,

148
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:08,161
the sale and use of drugs,

149
00:18:08,807 --> 00:18:10,927
alcoholic drinks,

150
00:18:10,927 --> 00:18:13,361
prostitution and pimping.

151
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:18,443
Offenders will be punished,
those who persist will be put to death.

152
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:22,758
Opium is prohibited.

153
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:26,843
-Alì la Pointe!
-Have you seen Hacène le Bonois?

154
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:29,196
Not today.

155
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,958
-Have you seen Hacène?
-No.

156
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:43,523
Margot? Margot?

157
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:45,407
What's the matter?

158
00:19:45,407 --> 00:19:47,204
-Come here.
-I'm coming.

159
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:50,164
-Have you seen Hacène le Bonois?
-No.

160
00:19:55,807 --> 00:19:57,638
-Have you seen Hacène le Bonois?
-No.

161
00:19:57,807 --> 00:19:59,365
Tell him I'm looking for him.

162
00:20:03,047 --> 00:20:06,767
Alì la Pointe,
I've not seen you for ages.

163
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:09,007
I thought you were in prison.

164
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:12,127
-Is Hacène here?
-He went out early.

165
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,367
-You know what the boss is like.
-I want to see him.

166
00:20:14,367 --> 00:20:16,278
I'm around.

167
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:25,355
-My boy, where've you been hiding.
-Stand still!

168
00:20:26,087 --> 00:20:29,767
-Don't move your hands.
-I don't carry arms.

169
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:32,927
-I know.
-Are you afraid of these?

170
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:35,760
-Don't move.
-Why are you afraid?

171
00:20:37,127 --> 00:20:41,598
We're friends.
You could say I raised you.

172
00:20:42,247 --> 00:20:44,283
-Isn't that so, Alì?
-That's true.

173
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:48,687
-What's happened to you?
-You're condemned to death.

174
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:53,602
So that's what it's come to.

175
00:20:55,007 --> 00:20:57,043
I could die of laughter.

176
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:03,640
-What are they paying you?
-Nothing.

177
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:07,367
They've told you twice.
This is the last time.

178
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:08,967
-Decide.
-What?

179
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:12,277
-What?
-To turn over a new leaf.

180
00:21:12,927 --> 00:21:14,724
Try to convince me.

181
00:21:17,287 --> 00:21:19,323
Stop! Take a good look.

182
00:21:19,727 --> 00:21:22,287
No one does what he likes now,
in the Kasbah.

183
00:21:22,287 --> 00:21:24,960
Not even Hacène, still less you lot.

184
00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:26,605
Now, beat it.

185
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,205
And tell the rest.

186
00:21:29,807 --> 00:21:31,160
Go!

187
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:36,640
June 10th 1956

188
00:21:42,807 --> 00:21:44,007
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

189
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:45,725
You stay outside and keep watch.

190
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:49,159
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

191
00:21:51,247 --> 00:21:53,715
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

192
00:22:08,047 --> 00:22:09,446
Sit down.

193
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:16,118
Let's hurry up with the formalities,
you know why.

194
00:22:18,007 --> 00:22:22,285
One day, weddings
will be in the open again.

195
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:26,527
It is very sad that a day like this

196
00:22:26,527 --> 00:22:31,396
should not be in the tradition
with the whole quarter celebrating.

197
00:22:33,447 --> 00:22:38,127
But to be first to desert
the offices of the French,

198
00:22:38,127 --> 00:22:42,040
to be married by the FLN,

199
00:22:42,647 --> 00:22:44,638
takes courage.

200
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:49,399
It's a conscious act of war.

201
00:22:55,847 --> 00:22:59,965
Let's start, Mahmoud e Fathia.

202
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:09,646
Sign here.

203
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:15,356
Here.

204
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:22,885
Congratulations.

205
00:23:23,647 --> 00:23:26,036
Best wishes.
Make yourselves comfortable.

206
00:24:06,127 --> 00:24:10,962
June 20th 1956, 10:32

207
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,841
Quiet. Speak quietly.

208
00:24:56,727 --> 00:24:58,319
Listen,

209
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:01,644
they want to talk to the inspector.

210
00:25:02,447 --> 00:25:04,244
Come on.

211
00:25:11,447 --> 00:25:14,166
You stay here, else it'll be like before.

212
00:26:09,207 --> 00:26:12,722
But, Sir, in Paris you can't imagine
what's happening here.

213
00:26:13,247 --> 00:26:16,047
The Government must be made to act.

214
00:26:16,047 --> 00:26:18,277
The press must move.

215
00:26:18,807 --> 00:26:20,087
The police?

216
00:26:20,087 --> 00:26:22,840
They're beset
by a thousand difficulties.

217
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:26,487
Exactly.

218
00:26:26,487 --> 00:26:28,523
They're hamstrung.

219
00:26:29,567 --> 00:26:30,602
No!

220
00:26:30,687 --> 00:26:34,127
Democratic methods, quibbles...

221
00:26:34,127 --> 00:26:36,243
meanwhile they're being shot at.

222
00:26:37,087 --> 00:26:39,555
The magistrature favours
a formal enquiry.

223
00:26:40,247 --> 00:26:41,965
Yes, sir.

224
00:26:43,887 --> 00:26:45,684
You must move.

225
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:49,200
But the press...

226
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,567
Is conditioning public opinion back to normal?

227
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:56,116
But couldn't you... Okay, as you wish.

228
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,517
They'll slaughter the lot of us!

229
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:06,997
Well... 3:00 p.m.:

230
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:11,037
patrol fired on.
Three soldiers wounded.

231
00:27:11,807 --> 00:27:13,647
Location: Rue Lanciani.

232
00:27:13,647 --> 00:27:17,686
3:30 p.m.:
shots fired at territorial guards.

233
00:27:18,447 --> 00:27:22,527
Location: intersection of main road
and Laquière Avenue.

234
00:27:22,527 --> 00:27:24,518
Excuse me a moment.

235
00:27:33,767 --> 00:27:36,156
Do you know,
these Paris types want us

236
00:27:36,807 --> 00:27:41,756
to continue to talk of... reconciliation
of our Moslem brothers.

237
00:27:46,327 --> 00:27:48,567
What do you say?

238
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:52,446
That Paris doesn't give two hoots.
That the Government's senile.

239
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:12,687
The Governor of Algiers decrees: Art. 1

240
00:28:12,687 --> 00:28:17,124
The purchase of medicines
suitable for treating gun wounds

241
00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:21,120
must be authorised by the Prefecture.

242
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:23,359
Art. 2

243
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:27,767
Hospitals and nursing homes
must inform the police

244
00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:32,602
about all patients admitted
for treatment.

245
00:28:37,647 --> 00:28:39,487
The Algiers Prefecture communicates

246
00:28:39,487 --> 00:28:44,322
that there have been dozens
of outrages in the city

247
00:28:44,887 --> 00:28:47,887
and it is presumed that
the culprits come from the Kasbah,

248
00:28:47,887 --> 00:28:53,086
or can easily and quickly find refuge
in the Arab quarters.

249
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:57,759
So, to restore order,

250
00:28:58,167 --> 00:29:01,207
the Prefect has decided
that military control posts

251
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:04,995
shall be set up around the Kasbah

252
00:29:05,367 --> 00:29:11,602
where citizens may have to show their
papers on request and be searched.

253
00:29:19,647 --> 00:29:21,080
Queue up!

254
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:23,445
Papers.

255
00:29:27,447 --> 00:29:30,723
-And you?
-But I'm French.

256
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:37,599
Stop!

257
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:41,557
Enough! Let her through.

258
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:44,956
What a job!

259
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:51,956
July 20th, 1 1 :20

260
00:30:38,927 --> 00:30:41,236
What do you want?

261
00:30:41,367 --> 00:30:43,517
I'm going swimming.

262
00:30:59,967 --> 00:31:03,039
-You again?
-I go this way.

263
00:31:03,567 --> 00:31:05,205
Come here.

264
00:31:10,887 --> 00:31:12,684
Now, beat it.

265
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:17,755
They kill and run away,
it's the same story!

266
00:32:18,047 --> 00:32:20,927
They should be exterminated
without pity.

267
00:32:20,927 --> 00:32:24,602
It's the Government's fault.
What does it care!

268
00:32:25,207 --> 00:32:27,516
He was very young.

269
00:32:33,047 --> 00:32:37,484
Murderers! Murderers! Murderers!

270
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:41,081
Enough! Let's finish it!

271
00:32:42,887 --> 00:32:44,927
Here's one!

272
00:32:44,927 --> 00:32:46,967
Where are you running to?

273
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:48,847
Black rat!

274
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:51,042
He's escaping. Grab him!

275
00:32:51,407 --> 00:32:54,047
It's him! I saw him!

276
00:32:54,047 --> 00:32:57,323
Murderer! Murderer!

277
00:33:18,847 --> 00:33:21,287
Culprit Lahidan Bualem

278
00:33:21,287 --> 00:33:23,887
labourer, married with three children,

279
00:33:23,887 --> 00:33:27,163
living at 8 Rue de Thèbes.

280
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:32,679
-How many today?
-Seven incidents, three dead.

281
00:33:33,807 --> 00:33:37,686
A copy for the teletype,
the foreign press and one for you.

282
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:40,964
Thanks. See you tomorrow.

283
00:33:41,247 --> 00:33:42,885
Goodbye.

284
00:33:43,887 --> 00:33:46,367
Tell me,

285
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:51,361
-where's Rue de Thèbes?
-In the upper Kasbah I believe.

286
00:33:52,047 --> 00:33:55,756
-Goodnight mummy, goodnight daddy!
-Goodnight.

287
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:57,967
-Fatma,
-Yes, madam?

288
00:33:57,967 --> 00:33:59,887
why are they still up?

289
00:33:59,887 --> 00:34:02,640
-Goodnight mummy!
-Goodnight.

290
00:34:03,287 --> 00:34:08,047
-We must go now.
-Don't go to the club,

291
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:10,515
play poker here.

292
00:34:12,447 --> 00:34:15,200
-At least another cognac.
-No, thanks.

293
00:34:17,287 --> 00:34:21,200
They're waiting for us, we're late.

294
00:34:21,647 --> 00:34:24,241
Goodnight all. Hurry up.

295
00:34:25,847 --> 00:34:27,917
-Bye-bye.
-Goodnight.

296
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:34,596
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

297
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:58,883
To Rue de Thèbes.

298
00:35:05,967 --> 00:35:07,082
Halt!

299
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:11,487
-Good evening.
-Can we go in?

300
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:16,087
You can't enter the Kasbah
at this time. It's quite impossible.

301
00:35:16,087 --> 00:35:18,282
Press! They're with me.

302
00:35:19,407 --> 00:35:22,604
-Go ahead then.
-Let's go, brothers!

303
00:39:10,367 --> 00:39:11,959
Alì!

304
00:39:12,447 --> 00:39:13,807
Alì, Alì!

305
00:39:13,807 --> 00:39:15,286
Alì!

306
00:39:22,287 --> 00:39:23,925
Alì, Alì, Alì!

307
00:39:29,247 --> 00:39:30,965
Alì, stop!

308
00:39:31,887 --> 00:39:34,401
-Kader says you must stop.
-Why?

309
00:39:35,047 --> 00:39:38,447
-Kader is trying to stop the people.
-Beat it.

310
00:39:38,447 --> 00:39:41,883
They'll kill us all.

311
00:39:42,287 --> 00:39:45,040
-Stop!
-Go away!

312
00:39:56,167 --> 00:40:00,407
Stay calm or they'll kill us all!

313
00:40:00,407 --> 00:40:04,685
Leave it to the organisation.

314
00:41:46,727 --> 00:41:49,287
You stand guard. You come in.

315
00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:58,606
-Okay like this?
-Perfect.

316
00:42:02,167 --> 00:42:04,283
What's wrong?

317
00:42:04,807 --> 00:42:07,275
I'll take my son.

318
00:42:07,887 --> 00:42:10,727
Okay,
but go by the Divan checkpoint.

319
00:42:10,727 --> 00:42:14,515
There's more traffic
and they're not so careful.

320
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,839
The air-line agency.

321
00:42:26,287 --> 00:42:27,766
Cafeteria in Rue Michelet.

322
00:42:30,647 --> 00:42:32,524
Milk bar in Rue d'Isly.

323
00:42:33,127 --> 00:42:35,807
They're short-time-fuse bombs,

324
00:42:35,807 --> 00:42:40,119
so they'll be set outside the Kasbah
at 3 Rue del Porto.

325
00:42:41,047 --> 00:42:43,647
But take care,
from that moment, move!

326
00:42:43,647 --> 00:42:46,366
You'll have 25 minutes.

327
00:42:48,367 --> 00:42:51,484
Now, go. Goodbye and good luck.

328
00:42:53,127 --> 00:42:54,446
Good luck.

329
00:42:55,287 --> 00:42:57,278
Fathia, God bless you.

330
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,366
Halt!

331
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:23,800
Okay, go.

332
00:43:25,607 --> 00:43:27,687
-Your papers.
-I've forgotten them.

333
00:43:27,687 --> 00:43:31,007
Over there then, move.

334
00:43:31,007 --> 00:43:37,003
I've got them at home. Leave me!

335
00:43:40,807 --> 00:43:42,957
-Give me a break.!
-I have to go to work.

336
00:43:44,047 --> 00:43:45,687
Get back!

337
00:43:45,687 --> 00:43:47,087
It's late.

338
00:43:47,087 --> 00:43:51,877
Keep calm or else
no one'll go through today.

339
00:43:52,727 --> 00:43:53,955
Excuse me.

340
00:43:54,127 --> 00:43:55,767
Excuse me.

341
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:57,200
Excuse me.

342
00:43:57,647 --> 00:43:59,956
-Excuse me, may I pass?
-Go on.

343
00:44:03,087 --> 00:44:04,600
-Good morning, madam.
-Good morning.

344
00:44:05,407 --> 00:44:06,767
And you?

345
00:44:06,767 --> 00:44:08,485
Beg pardon, madam.

346
00:44:23,567 --> 00:44:25,717
Come on, move.

347
00:44:30,327 --> 00:44:31,726
Halt!

348
00:44:32,607 --> 00:44:34,087
Wait.

349
00:44:34,087 --> 00:44:35,281
Okay,move on.

350
00:44:36,167 --> 00:44:37,646
Next one.

351
00:44:40,447 --> 00:44:42,597
Go on.

352
00:44:45,407 --> 00:44:46,726
Please, madam.

353
00:44:49,127 --> 00:44:50,526
What's in there?

354
00:44:58,647 --> 00:45:03,437
I'll be gone an hour.
He's a very good boy.

355
00:45:04,407 --> 00:45:06,682
Be good. Thank you, thank you.

356
00:45:12,287 --> 00:45:16,280
-Going to the sea, miss?
-How did you guess?

357
00:45:16,607 --> 00:45:18,802
The bag, the towel...

358
00:45:19,447 --> 00:45:22,767
-Alone?
-No, with friends.

359
00:45:22,767 --> 00:45:26,555
Next Sunday I'll be free. How about it?

360
00:45:26,927 --> 00:45:29,316
-We'll see.
-See you next Sunday.

361
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:30,686
Good luck.

362
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,319
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

363
00:47:12,047 --> 00:47:15,887
-An amarena.
-Please, have a seat.

364
00:47:15,887 --> 00:47:18,355
-No, thank you.
-Please, miss, have a seat.

365
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:26,566
Going already, miss? Cheerio.

366
00:49:33,367 --> 00:49:37,327
Attention please, flight 432 for Paris

367
00:49:37,327 --> 00:49:39,841
will be delayed twenty minutes.

368
00:49:41,047 --> 00:49:45,687
Attention please, flight 432 for Paris

369
00:49:45,687 --> 00:49:48,201
will be delayed twenty minutes.

370
00:50:45,567 --> 00:50:48,447
Seems like a gas explosion.

371
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:51,359
Must be close, towards the port.

372
00:50:52,567 --> 00:50:54,956
A fire. Look, firemen.

373
00:51:02,167 --> 00:51:04,442
Come on, let's dance.

374
00:51:57,367 --> 00:51:58,487
Another!

375
00:51:58,487 --> 00:52:03,163
Murderers! Murderers! Murderers!

376
00:52:03,767 --> 00:52:05,047
Another!

377
00:52:05,047 --> 00:52:08,756
Criminals!

378
00:52:24,247 --> 00:52:27,956
January 10th 1957

379
00:52:48,367 --> 00:52:51,567
Mr. Lefevre, the Inspector General
of the Administration,

380
00:52:51,567 --> 00:52:57,247
has taken drastic steps
to ensure law and order

381
00:52:57,247 --> 00:52:59,602
and to protect people and property.

382
00:53:00,047 --> 00:53:02,959
In particular to bring
the 10th Para Division into Algiers

383
00:53:03,047 --> 00:53:08,440
from antiguerrilla operations
on the Kabir plateau.

384
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:14,487
The Commander will take over
responsibility for law

385
00:53:14,487 --> 00:53:18,560
and order in Algiers using
all civil and military measures

386
00:53:18,647 --> 00:53:20,683
necessary for the job.

387
00:53:23,687 --> 00:53:26,759
Surname: Mathieu.
Christian name: Philippe.

388
00:53:26,887 --> 00:53:29,082
Born in Rennes on the 3rd May 1 906.

389
00:53:29,367 --> 00:53:31,087
Rank: Lieutenant-Colonial.

390
00:53:31,087 --> 00:53:33,999
School: Polytechnic.
Degree in Engineering.

391
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,367
Campaigns: World War II,

392
00:53:36,367 --> 00:53:41,077
Resistance Movement in Italy,
Indo-China war and Algeria war.

393
00:53:41,727 --> 00:53:46,207
The average during the last months
is 4,2 incidents per day

394
00:53:46,207 --> 00:53:50,519
including individual attacks
and explosions.

395
00:53:52,047 --> 00:53:55,887
The problem, as usual, is:
1st - the enemy;

396
00:53:55,887 --> 00:53:58,560
2nd - how to destroy him.

397
00:53:59,447 --> 00:54:01,438
There are 80.000 Arabs in the Kasbah.

398
00:54:01,927 --> 00:54:03,918
All against us?

399
00:54:04,127 --> 00:54:05,845
No, for sure.

400
00:54:06,207 --> 00:54:10,644
There's only a minority
which rules by violence.

401
00:54:12,287 --> 00:54:16,200
This is the enemy
to isolate and destroy.

402
00:54:17,447 --> 00:54:18,880
Draw the curtains.

403
00:54:19,127 --> 00:54:21,925
It moves on the surface and below.

404
00:54:22,887 --> 00:54:27,517
Using well-tried revolutionary tactics
and original techniques.

405
00:54:30,527 --> 00:54:33,519
It's an unknown,
unrecognisable enemy.

406
00:54:34,207 --> 00:54:36,516
It blends with the others.

407
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:38,887
It is everywhere.

408
00:54:38,887 --> 00:54:43,005
In the alleys of the Kasbah in the
European quarter, where people work.

409
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,365
These shots were taken by the police

410
00:54:49,527 --> 00:54:52,087
with cameras hidden at checkpoints.

411
00:54:53,167 --> 00:54:55,761
They thought them to be useful.

412
00:54:56,407 --> 00:55:00,639
They are useful to show the
uselessness of certain methods

413
00:55:01,127 --> 00:55:03,561
or at least, their shortcomings.

414
00:55:05,567 --> 00:55:07,087
I've chosen these films

415
00:55:07,087 --> 00:55:11,922
because they were taken in the hours
preceding recent incidents.

416
00:55:13,087 --> 00:55:18,480
Amongst these Arabs, men and women,
are those responsible.

417
00:55:18,967 --> 00:55:22,084
But which? How to recognise them?

418
00:55:24,047 --> 00:55:26,607
Not from their papers, that's for sure.

419
00:55:26,607 --> 00:55:29,679
If anyone has them in order,
it's the terrorist.

420
00:55:35,647 --> 00:55:37,558
Watch the film.

421
00:55:38,407 --> 00:55:41,683
The operator had his doubts
about the basket,

422
00:55:42,727 --> 00:55:44,877
and keeps it in the field.

423
00:55:47,727 --> 00:55:51,356
Perhaps the bomb was there,
in a false bottom. Who knows?

424
00:55:51,567 --> 00:55:53,319
We'll never know.

425
00:55:53,647 --> 00:55:55,126
That's enough.

426
00:55:58,167 --> 00:56:00,476
We have no information,

427
00:56:00,927 --> 00:56:04,727
apart from that on the structure
of the organisation.

428
00:56:04,727 --> 00:56:06,524
Let's start from there.

429
00:56:07,287 --> 00:56:10,287
It's an organisation like a pyramid,

430
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:14,644
with sectors themselves
formed by a series of triangles.

431
00:56:15,367 --> 00:56:17,835
At the apex of the pyramid
is the Chief of Staff.

432
00:56:18,607 --> 00:56:20,847
The military boss,
responsible to the political bureau,

433
00:56:20,847 --> 00:56:24,556
nominates the person
responsible for one sector: N. 1 .

434
00:56:25,807 --> 00:56:30,358
Number one selects the other two

435
00:56:31,127 --> 00:56:33,163
and so triangle one is formed.

436
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:37,164
Number two and number three,
each select two men.

437
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:41,243
And so on.

438
00:56:42,447 --> 00:56:44,327
Because of this structure,

439
00:56:44,327 --> 00:56:47,876
each member only knows three
members of the organisation.

440
00:56:48,367 --> 00:56:50,967
The one who chose him.

441
00:56:50,967 --> 00:56:53,607
And the two he chose.

442
00:56:53,607 --> 00:56:55,757
Contact is only by writing.

443
00:56:56,087 --> 00:56:59,807
So we don't know our enemy.

444
00:56:59,807 --> 00:57:04,039
In practice,
they don't know each other, either.

445
00:57:05,167 --> 00:57:08,247
If we know him we can eliminate him.

446
00:57:08,247 --> 00:57:12,638
The military angle is secondary.

447
00:57:13,447 --> 00:57:16,564
It's the police side that matters.

448
00:57:17,327 --> 00:57:20,080
Yes, the word's not to your liking.

449
00:57:21,447 --> 00:57:24,917
But, it's the only one which sums up
what we have to do.

450
00:57:26,567 --> 00:57:31,357
We must make investigations which
run through the entire pyramid.

451
00:57:31,767 --> 00:57:37,125
The basis of our job is information,
the method, the interrogation.

452
00:57:38,727 --> 00:57:42,959
Interrogation conducted so as to get
an answer, always.

453
00:57:44,207 --> 00:57:47,358
In this situation, false sentiment

454
00:57:47,767 --> 00:57:50,804
leads to ridicule and impotence.

455
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:57,000
I am certain that all sections
will act accordingly.

456
00:57:57,967 --> 00:58:00,117
However it doesn't depend just on us.

457
00:58:01,607 --> 00:58:04,367
We must have the Kasbah available,

458
00:58:04,367 --> 00:58:07,359
screen it, question everyone.

459
00:58:08,367 --> 00:58:11,407
But we're up against a mass
of laws and regulations.

460
00:58:11,407 --> 00:58:16,435
It's like being in a holiday resort,
not a battlefield.

461
00:58:17,407 --> 00:58:20,956
We've asked for carte blanche,
but we haven't got it.

462
00:58:22,087 --> 00:58:26,797
We need the opportunity
that will legalise our actions.

463
00:58:27,807 --> 00:58:30,526
We ourselves must create
this opening.

464
00:58:31,527 --> 00:58:34,847
Unless our adversaries do it for us.

465
00:58:34,847 --> 00:58:36,724
As I believe.

466
00:58:48,127 --> 00:58:52,040
God bless you.

467
00:58:53,967 --> 00:58:55,764
To all combatants,

468
00:58:56,167 --> 00:59:01,161
after two years' bitter struggle,
the Algerian people has its victory.

469
00:59:01,607 --> 00:59:05,043
The United Nations will debate
the Algerian question,

470
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:07,965
starting on Monday 28th January.

471
00:59:09,287 --> 00:59:14,122
The FLN proclaims a general strike.

472
00:59:14,647 --> 00:59:19,437
For the entire period there will be
no armed action or incidents.

473
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:25,198
Combatants are mobilised
for the success of the strike.

474
00:59:27,567 --> 00:59:30,240
Le Monde! General strike!

475
00:59:32,967 --> 00:59:34,958
The 8-day strike.

476
00:59:40,647 --> 00:59:41,966
My money?

477
00:59:49,047 --> 00:59:50,639
Strike!

478
00:59:57,046 --> 01:00:00,118
Brothers, Algerians,
there is great hope for us.

479
01:00:00,606 --> 01:00:06,158
The next few days will decide
our future and our freedom.

480
01:00:06,726 --> 01:00:11,925
The colonists will tell the UN that
the FLN does not represent our people.

481
01:00:12,366 --> 01:00:16,279
Our reply will be our support
of the general strike.

482
01:00:22,406 --> 01:00:26,966
Don't move during these 8 days,
don't leave the Kasbah.

483
01:00:26,966 --> 01:00:29,526
Lodge in your own houses the poor,
the beggars,

484
01:00:29,526 --> 01:00:33,485
who have no houses,
stock up with food and water.

485
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:46,523
See? No one's coming out tonight.
They seem happy.

486
01:00:50,766 --> 01:00:53,724
Rats in a trap we hope.

487
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:58,686
-Think the strike will be 100°/o?
-Certainly.

488
01:00:58,686 --> 01:01:02,599
A name, Mathieu.

489
01:01:03,486 --> 01:01:06,446
-A name?
-A name for this operation.

490
01:01:06,446 --> 01:01:09,563
Off the cuff, it's difficult.

491
01:01:33,846 --> 01:01:35,598
Champagne, eh?

492
01:01:36,166 --> 01:01:41,604
Champagne? Champagne?
Operation Champagne. Yes, fine.

493
01:01:52,446 --> 01:01:54,846
They're beggars,
unemployed, homeless.

494
01:01:54,846 --> 01:01:59,442
They're staying with these families
during the strike,

495
01:01:59,486 --> 01:02:02,239
clear of police sweeps and reprisals.

496
01:02:03,326 --> 01:02:06,238
But I wouldn't have thought
they'd have been brought here.

497
01:02:06,646 --> 01:02:09,046
-It's a mistake.
-Why?

498
01:02:09,046 --> 01:02:10,926
Because you're here.

499
01:02:10,926 --> 01:02:13,406
You'd better change house.

500
01:02:13,406 --> 01:02:16,682
-Don't you trust them?
-You never know.

501
01:02:18,246 --> 01:02:20,686
You 're the boss.

502
01:02:20,686 --> 01:02:24,679
If the decision had been up to me,
you wouldn't have been in Algiers.

503
01:02:28,246 --> 01:02:31,283
-Why? Isn't it prudent?
-No, it isn't.

504
01:02:35,406 --> 01:02:39,160
Go with Ben M'Hidi
to the Maison des Arbres.

505
01:02:41,646 --> 01:02:43,079
Isn't he sleeping here?

506
01:02:43,246 --> 01:02:46,124
There are too many new faces around.

507
01:02:46,326 --> 01:02:50,478
Here we are.
Look at this for a hide-out.

508
01:02:51,486 --> 01:02:55,843
Seems like a wall.
A bit of dirt and it'll be perfect.

509
01:02:56,166 --> 01:02:59,238
-Look inside.
-No, it's late.

510
01:03:04,726 --> 01:03:07,843
This is a family of old fighters,
you'll be okay.

511
01:03:08,086 --> 01:03:10,042
Hurry up.

512
01:03:14,086 --> 01:03:16,680
The terrace is the shortest way.

513
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,560
You'll be safe with Alì.

514
01:03:32,046 --> 01:03:34,480
All right, you can come.

515
01:03:41,766 --> 01:03:43,916
Fine. They're waiting.

516
01:03:46,166 --> 01:03:49,522
-What do you think about the strike?
-It'll succeed.

517
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:54,121
Yes, I reckon so too.
It's well organised.

518
01:03:55,246 --> 01:04:00,957
-But the French?
-Obviously they'll try to break it.

519
01:04:01,406 --> 01:04:03,840
They'll do more.

520
01:04:04,406 --> 01:04:06,920
We've given them the chance.

521
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:10,115
Understand what I mean?

522
01:04:10,926 --> 01:04:13,645
They'll no longer be groping.

523
01:04:15,406 --> 01:04:19,957
Every workman, shopkeeper who
strikes will be a recognisable enemy,

524
01:04:20,566 --> 01:04:24,161
a confessed offender,
and they can pass to the offensive.

525
01:04:25,526 --> 01:04:28,245
-Have you thought of this?
-No.

526
01:04:29,326 --> 01:04:33,126
Kader says you weren't in favour
of the strike.

527
01:04:33,126 --> 01:04:35,640
No, nor my men.

528
01:04:36,046 --> 01:04:37,246
Why?

529
01:04:37,246 --> 01:04:40,204
Because they say
we mustn't use arms.

530
01:04:41,006 --> 01:04:44,237
You don't win wars with outrages.

531
01:04:44,406 --> 01:04:46,840
Neither wars nor revolutions.

532
01:04:47,126 --> 01:04:52,996
But later,
the people themselves must move.

533
01:04:53,366 --> 01:04:56,358
That's the reason behind the need
to strike.

534
01:04:56,806 --> 01:05:00,276
To mobilise all the Algerians,
to count them.

535
01:05:00,846 --> 01:05:03,126
-Assess our strength.
-Of course.

536
01:05:03,126 --> 01:05:05,003
To let the UN see, no?

537
01:05:05,326 --> 01:05:08,966
Yes, the UN too.

538
01:05:08,966 --> 01:05:11,326
I don't know whether this'll be
of much use,

539
01:05:11,326 --> 01:05:16,241
but at least the UN
can see our strength.

540
01:05:17,326 --> 01:05:21,842
You know,
it's difficult to start a revolution.

541
01:05:23,846 --> 01:05:26,280
Even more difficult to continue it.

542
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:29,361
Very difficult to win it.

543
01:05:29,886 --> 01:05:36,405
But the real difficulties come later.
When we've won.

544
01:05:38,326 --> 01:05:41,875
Ah, well, there's still a lot to do.

545
01:05:42,886 --> 01:05:45,923
-You are not tired?
-No.

546
01:06:40,926 --> 01:06:43,281
Wake up! Wake up!

547
01:07:47,966 --> 01:07:51,566
To all vehicles, speed up the sweep.

548
01:07:51,566 --> 01:07:54,966
Truck No.1 : El Biar worksite.
No.2: Gasworks.

549
01:07:54,966 --> 01:07:57,321
No.3: Port, Goods Quay.

550
01:07:57,726 --> 01:08:00,446
Attention! Political affairs personnel,

551
01:08:00,446 --> 01:08:04,121
arrange for suspects to be sent
in to H.Q.

552
01:08:08,086 --> 01:08:09,280
That one.

553
01:08:09,526 --> 01:08:11,246
You, here.

554
01:08:11,246 --> 01:08:12,846
What's your name?

555
01:08:12,846 --> 01:08:15,326
-Why are you striking?
-I was at home.

556
01:08:15,326 --> 01:08:17,396
Why have you gone on strike?

557
01:08:18,246 --> 01:08:20,046
Did they force you?

558
01:08:20,046 --> 01:08:22,406
-Let's have the truth!
-No.

559
01:08:22,406 --> 01:08:25,566
So you went on strike: are you FLN?

560
01:08:25,566 --> 01:08:28,406
Speak up. Are you scared to talk?

561
01:08:28,406 --> 01:08:33,400
It doesn't matter. This one for H.Q. too.

562
01:08:33,966 --> 01:08:36,196
You, there. Stop!

563
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:39,360
Move! To work!

564
01:08:41,246 --> 01:08:44,966
Talk about a strike!
12 hours' work today!

565
01:08:44,966 --> 01:08:47,560
A whole 12 hours!

566
01:08:47,726 --> 01:08:53,326
4th day, the strike continues
with the full support of the people.

567
01:08:53,326 --> 01:08:56,086
All's quiet. Quiet, are you deaf?

568
01:08:56,086 --> 01:09:00,398
The city's dead quiet. In the Moslem
areas and in the Kasbah...

569
01:09:01,406 --> 01:09:03,283
Cheerio, I'll call you later.

570
01:09:05,086 --> 01:09:06,804
Mathieu's here.

571
01:09:08,846 --> 01:09:10,359
Colonel.

572
01:09:11,646 --> 01:09:14,166
-Colonel, a statement please.
-What do you want to know?

573
01:09:14,166 --> 01:09:16,486
-Any news?
-There's a meeting with the Prefect.

574
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:18,556
-What's now?
-It's nothing.

575
01:09:19,046 --> 01:09:21,037
Just an initial assessment.

576
01:09:21,326 --> 01:09:24,686
Go around.
You'll see with your own eyes.

577
01:09:24,686 --> 01:09:28,156
-The strike's successful.
-It's not achieved its aim.

578
01:09:28,606 --> 01:09:30,286
-Revolt?
-Revolt.

579
01:09:30,286 --> 01:09:32,726
But the strike
was just a demonstration.

580
01:09:32,726 --> 01:09:34,126
Do you believe the FLN?

581
01:09:34,126 --> 01:09:37,846
A general strike
is a good argument at the UN.

582
01:09:37,846 --> 01:09:41,766
The UN's not here.
Bombs make more noise.

583
01:09:41,766 --> 01:09:45,042
That's what I'd use in their place,
I assure you.

584
01:09:45,646 --> 01:09:50,726
-Armed revolt, what's that exactly?
-It'd be armed revolt.

585
01:09:50,726 --> 01:09:55,126
It's an inevitable step.
First terrorism, then revolt.

586
01:09:55,126 --> 01:09:59,246
Same as, guerrilla tactics, then war
proper that's the deciding factor.

587
01:09:59,246 --> 01:10:05,086
-Dien Bien Phu?
-Exactly, but in Indo-China they won.

588
01:10:05,086 --> 01:10:06,486
And here?

589
01:10:06,486 --> 01:10:08,326
-It depends on you.
-It depends on us?

590
01:10:08,326 --> 01:10:12,086
-You want us to enlist?
-No,

591
01:10:12,086 --> 01:10:16,406
there's no lack of soldiers.
You only have to write. And write well.

592
01:10:16,406 --> 01:10:18,726
-What's lacking?
-Political will,

593
01:10:18,726 --> 01:10:22,844
which is sometimes present,
but at time is not enough.

594
01:10:23,406 --> 01:10:27,115
-What's Paris saying?
-There's another article by Sartre.

595
01:10:30,206 --> 01:10:33,246
Why are the Sartres always
on the other side?

596
01:10:33,246 --> 01:10:38,320
-Would you like a Sartre?
-No. But even less so as an enemy.

597
01:10:43,246 --> 01:10:46,124
One, two, three, four, inside.

598
01:10:47,766 --> 01:10:49,358
Come on.

599
01:11:04,046 --> 01:11:06,435
-What's happening?
-They're dancing.

600
01:11:16,246 --> 01:11:18,126
Let's have you.

601
01:11:18,126 --> 01:11:21,046
From the start, then you can go.
First name?

602
01:11:21,046 --> 01:11:22,806
-Sid Ahmed.
-Surname?

603
01:11:22,806 --> 01:11:24,006
Sail.

604
01:11:24,006 --> 01:11:26,166
-District?
-Second.

605
01:11:26,166 --> 01:11:28,760
-Be more precise.
-District No.2,

606
01:11:29,406 --> 01:11:30,966
the Kasbah, Algiers West.

607
01:11:30,966 --> 01:11:32,646
-Which Group?
-Third Group.

608
01:11:32,646 --> 01:11:37,037
-What was your job?
-Responsible for the Sixth Squad.

609
01:11:42,446 --> 01:11:45,324
Ahmed Sail,

610
01:11:48,166 --> 01:11:50,043
Sixth Squad.

611
01:12:14,006 --> 01:12:16,395
Stay there! Don't move!

612
01:12:42,926 --> 01:12:45,565
Sixth day of strike.

613
01:12:46,646 --> 01:12:50,126
Look lively,
there's work to do tomorrow.

614
01:12:50,126 --> 01:12:53,721
People of the Kasbah,
Algerians, listen.

615
01:12:54,446 --> 01:12:57,686
The FLN want to stop you
from working.

616
01:12:57,686 --> 01:13:01,126
They make you shut your shops.

617
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:04,606
Rebel against their orders.

618
01:13:04,606 --> 01:13:06,806
France is your country.

619
01:13:06,806 --> 01:13:09,686
She has given you
civilisation and wealth.

620
01:13:09,686 --> 01:13:13,440
Schools, roads and hospitals.

621
01:13:21,286 --> 01:13:25,837
Algerians return to work.
Algerians, listen...

622
01:13:26,646 --> 01:13:29,604
My husband was at the port,
isn't he with you?

623
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:33,204
Ramid Fouad! Who's seen him?

624
01:13:34,086 --> 01:13:35,838
Bel Casel | . Bel Casel| !

625
01:13:37,886 --> 01:13:39,114
My son!

626
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:13,806
Algerians, brothers!

627
01:14:13,806 --> 01:14:15,876
Take courage.

628
01:14:16,246 --> 01:14:18,126
Algeria will be free!

629
01:14:18,126 --> 01:14:21,084
Brothers, resist.

630
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:23,680
Don't listen to what they say.

631
01:14:23,766 --> 01:14:25,882
Algeria will be free.

632
01:14:50,086 --> 01:14:53,920
February 5th 1957
Last day of strike.

633
01:15:06,006 --> 01:15:09,442
Open the shops!
Don't you want to sell?

634
01:15:28,846 --> 01:15:30,996
Pull!

635
01:15:49,446 --> 01:15:56,046
The UN Assembly has decided that
there will be no direct UN intervention

636
01:15:56,046 --> 01:16:02,360
on the Algerian question as none
of the motions received a majority.

637
01:16:03,406 --> 01:16:08,486
The UN however expresses the hope
that in a spirit of co-operation

638
01:16:08,486 --> 01:16:11,846
a peaceful and democratic solution
will be found

639
01:16:11,846 --> 01:16:14,679
in keeping with the principles
of the UN Charter.

640
01:17:00,926 --> 01:17:04,236
Very good.

641
01:17:05,326 --> 01:17:07,317
Now let's go to bed.

642
01:17:08,646 --> 01:17:12,166
The end of the strike changes nothing,
orders are the same.

643
01:17:12,166 --> 01:17:14,282
Keep the boys on duty.

644
01:17:14,846 --> 01:17:17,918
We must stay in the Kasbah
24 hours a day.

645
01:17:19,246 --> 01:17:22,716
We must stay in there ready to act.

646
01:17:30,166 --> 01:17:34,606
-Any of you ever had a taenia?
-No.

647
01:17:34,606 --> 01:17:37,166
It's a worm that grows to infinity.

648
01:17:37,166 --> 01:17:40,238
You can kill thousands of segments,
but if the head remains,

649
01:17:40,606 --> 01:17:44,076
it immediately reproduces.

650
01:17:45,046 --> 01:17:46,923
The FLN's the same.

651
01:17:47,086 --> 01:17:50,715
The head is the General Staff:
four people.

652
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:55,000
If this is not eliminated,
we'll always be at square one.

653
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:04,400
I found these in the police files.

654
01:18:04,526 --> 01:18:07,165
I had them enlarged.

655
01:18:08,086 --> 01:18:09,439
Ramel.

656
01:18:10,566 --> 01:18:11,965
Si Mourad.

657
01:18:13,446 --> 01:18:14,845
Kader.

658
01:18:16,046 --> 01:18:17,445
Alì la Pointe.

659
01:18:18,406 --> 01:18:21,716
We'll print a thousand
to give to our boys.

660
01:18:41,526 --> 01:18:43,721
You can come out.

661
01:19:04,086 --> 01:19:05,485
Good.

662
01:19:06,166 --> 01:19:08,475
There were ten this time.

663
01:19:08,726 --> 01:19:10,326
-Parachutists?
-Yes.

664
01:19:10,326 --> 01:19:13,602
-Did they come here specifically?
-By chance.

665
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:16,634
They only asked a few questions.

666
01:19:23,446 --> 01:19:26,086
Attention! Attention!

667
01:19:26,086 --> 01:19:27,966
Inhabitants of the Kasbah,

668
01:19:27,966 --> 01:19:32,960
the terrorist Ben Amin
was executed this morning.

669
01:19:33,646 --> 01:19:36,606
Qrara Normendine was arrested.

670
01:19:36,606 --> 01:19:40,042
Boussalem Alì was arrested.

671
01:19:40,126 --> 01:19:43,675
Bel Kasel Maussà was arrested.

672
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:49,684
Inhabitants of the Kasbah,
the FLN lost.

673
01:19:50,166 --> 01:19:52,366
Rebel against
the few remaining terrorists

674
01:19:52,366 --> 01:19:56,598
who are involving you
in a useless and bloody struggle.

675
01:19:57,526 --> 01:20:02,884
People of the Kasbah,
the terrorist Ben Amin has been executed.

676
01:20:03,526 --> 01:20:07,280
Work with us
for a free and peaceful Algeria.

677
01:20:08,246 --> 01:20:13,240
People of the Kasbah,
the FLN has lost the battle.

678
01:20:13,926 --> 01:20:16,206
Rebel against
the few remaining terrorists

679
01:20:16,206 --> 01:20:19,721
who are involving you
in a useless and bloody struggle.

680
01:20:20,286 --> 01:20:22,641
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

681
01:20:23,126 --> 01:20:25,117
Cheer up.

682
01:20:25,646 --> 01:20:29,798
... the terrorist Ben Amin
was executed this morning.

683
01:20:30,486 --> 01:20:33,284
Qrara Normendine was arrested.

684
01:20:33,806 --> 01:20:36,240
Boussalem Alì was arrested.

685
01:20:37,086 --> 01:20:39,766
We'll split up,
that will improve our chances.

686
01:20:39,766 --> 01:20:42,966
We must change hide-outs
continuously,

687
01:20:42,966 --> 01:20:46,925
and never stay in one place.
Meanwhile, renew lost contacts.

688
01:20:47,486 --> 01:20:49,363
Replace arrested brothers.

689
01:20:49,686 --> 01:20:51,446
Reorganise.

690
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:55,446
-Yes, make ourselves felt.
-As soon as possible.

691
01:20:55,446 --> 01:20:58,483
Immediately. The people are down.

692
01:20:59,046 --> 01:21:02,163
-Leave it to me.
-No. None of us.

693
01:21:02,686 --> 01:21:05,678
Whilst we're here,
the FLN's in the Kasbah,

694
01:21:06,286 --> 01:21:11,006
else there'll be nothing.
Nothing comes out of nothing.

695
01:21:11,006 --> 01:21:12,837
But we must do something.

696
01:21:13,126 --> 01:21:16,721
We'll do something,
as soon as we remake contacts.

697
01:21:16,926 --> 01:21:19,963
-How do we move?
-We'll change methods.

698
01:22:44,926 --> 01:22:46,723
Who're you?

699
01:22:47,566 --> 01:22:50,326
Quick, hide us, we're being followed.

700
01:22:50,326 --> 01:22:53,238
Where, my boy? The house is small.

701
01:22:53,526 --> 01:22:55,886
-They'd find you.
-In the well.

702
01:22:55,886 --> 01:22:58,400
God look after you.

703
01:23:00,846 --> 01:23:03,155
The well's nearly dry.

704
01:23:36,086 --> 01:23:41,035
They've gone. They've turned
the corner, the others are far off.

705
01:23:41,926 --> 01:23:43,405
Thanks.

706
01:23:46,646 --> 01:23:49,399
We're making contact
with the 2nd and the 5th sectors.

707
01:23:50,566 --> 01:23:52,841
The 1st and 6th
have had too many losses.

708
01:23:53,326 --> 01:23:55,566
The 3rd and the 4th are reorganising.

709
01:23:55,566 --> 01:23:59,354
Two sectors are enough
to start moving.

710
01:23:59,846 --> 01:24:02,235
February 25th 1 957

711
01:24:29,086 --> 01:24:31,964
Murderers! Murderers!

712
01:24:32,046 --> 01:24:35,925
Blackface bastard!

713
01:24:40,406 --> 01:24:44,445
You're just like them!

714
01:24:44,486 --> 01:24:47,446
Get back! What're you doing!
Are you mad!

715
01:24:47,446 --> 01:24:51,086
Get back!
Don't be like them, it's a child!

716
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:53,725
Well? They kill our children!

717
01:25:18,366 --> 01:25:20,755
March 4th 1957

718
01:25:27,926 --> 01:25:32,966
Mr. Ben M'Hidi, isn't it a filthy thing
to use women's baskets

719
01:25:32,966 --> 01:25:36,163
to carry explosives for killing people?

720
01:25:38,246 --> 01:25:42,726
Doesn't it seem even filthier to drop
napalm bombs on defenceless villages

721
01:25:42,726 --> 01:25:45,684
wreaking even greater havoc?

722
01:25:45,766 --> 01:25:48,917
It would be better if we too had planes.

723
01:25:49,446 --> 01:25:53,041
Give me the bombers
and you can have the baskets.

724
01:26:01,846 --> 01:26:06,046
Mr. Williams wants to know whether,
according to you,

725
01:26:06,046 --> 01:26:11,882
the FLN still has the possibility
of beating the French Forces.

726
01:26:12,046 --> 01:26:16,086
The FLN has more possibility
of beating the French Forces

727
01:26:16,086 --> 01:26:18,805
than they have of stopping history.

728
01:26:19,326 --> 01:26:26,198
Colonel Mathieu said that you were
arrested by chance. By mistake.

729
01:26:26,326 --> 01:26:30,446
I understand that the paras
were looking for someone

730
01:26:30,446 --> 01:26:32,323
less important than you.

731
01:26:32,726 --> 01:26:38,039
Could you say why you were in that flat
in Rue Debussy?

732
01:26:38,686 --> 01:26:42,474
I can only say
I'd rather not have been there.

733
01:26:43,406 --> 01:26:46,806
That's enough, gentlemen.
That's all for now.

734
01:26:46,806 --> 01:26:49,798
-Show over?
-Correct.

735
01:26:50,566 --> 01:26:52,761
Before it backfires.

736
01:27:03,246 --> 01:27:06,556
Closed for having taken part
in the strike.

737
01:27:07,086 --> 01:27:11,206
People of the Kasbah,
the rebellion is petering out.

738
01:27:11,206 --> 01:27:14,446
... was executed just now.

739
01:27:14,446 --> 01:27:19,281
Kassem Moussu of FLN Sector 2
has been arrested.

740
01:27:19,686 --> 01:27:24,606
People of the Kasbah,
the FLN terrorists are false friends.

741
01:27:24,606 --> 01:27:26,566
Abandon them.

742
01:27:26,566 --> 01:27:29,366
Count on the protection
of the French Army.

743
01:27:29,366 --> 01:27:31,766
Denounce terrorists and agitators.

744
01:27:31,766 --> 01:27:35,554
Work with us to bring back
peace and prosperity.

745
01:27:48,326 --> 01:27:53,400
Colonel Mathieu, the spokesman of the
Resident Minister Morlin states that

746
01:27:53,566 --> 01:27:58,003
Ben M'Hidi hung himself in his cell,

747
01:27:58,046 --> 01:28:01,966
tearing up his shirt to make a rope

748
01:28:01,966 --> 01:28:04,846
which he tied
to the bars of the window.

749
01:28:04,846 --> 01:28:07,286
In an earlier statement

750
01:28:07,286 --> 01:28:10,686
the same spokesman said that

751
01:28:10,686 --> 01:28:15,846
because the prisoner said he would
escape on the first possible occasion,

752
01:28:15,846 --> 01:28:21,876
it was thought advisable to keep him
permanently bound hand and foot.

753
01:28:22,326 --> 01:28:24,246
According to you, Colonel

754
01:28:24,246 --> 01:28:30,003
is a man in this condition capable
of ripping up his shirt

755
01:28:30,566 --> 01:28:35,515
making a rope and tying it
to the window bars?

756
01:28:36,246 --> 01:28:38,806
You should ask the spokesman
about that.

757
01:28:38,846 --> 01:28:41,280
I didn't make the statements.

758
01:28:42,166 --> 01:28:49,006
For my part, I appreciated Ben M'Hidi's
moral strength intelligence

759
01:28:49,006 --> 01:28:52,166
and the way he stuck to his ideals.

760
01:28:52,166 --> 01:28:56,126
And so, even though I recognise
that he was dangerous,

761
01:28:56,126 --> 01:28:58,846
I pay homage to his memory.

762
01:28:58,846 --> 01:29:05,886
Colonel, there's been talk recently
of the paras' successes,

763
01:29:05,886 --> 01:29:09,640
and of the methods they're said to use.

764
01:29:10,046 --> 01:29:12,037
Could you say something on this?

765
01:29:12,166 --> 01:29:14,760
The successes result
from these methods.

766
01:29:15,646 --> 01:29:17,846
The one presupposes the other.

767
01:29:17,846 --> 01:29:23,796
I feel that in being excessively careful

768
01:29:24,246 --> 01:29:28,034
my colleagues keep asking
round-about questions

769
01:29:28,446 --> 01:29:31,404
to which you can only reply
in a round-about way.

770
01:29:31,686 --> 01:29:37,079
It would be better to call a spade
a spade.

771
01:29:37,446 --> 01:29:39,926
If it's torture, let's speak of torture.

772
01:29:39,926 --> 01:29:43,446
I understand. You have no questions?

773
01:29:43,446 --> 01:29:48,315
The questions have been asked.
We would like answers.

774
01:29:48,926 --> 01:29:50,917
Let us be exact.

775
01:29:51,126 --> 01:29:53,806
The word torture does not appear
in our orders.

776
01:29:53,806 --> 01:29:59,915
We ask questions as in any police
operation against an unknown gang.

777
01:30:00,886 --> 01:30:04,086
The FLN asks its members
to keep silent for 24 hours,

778
01:30:04,086 --> 01:30:07,601
if they are captured.

779
01:30:08,126 --> 01:30:09,486
Then they can talk.

780
01:30:09,486 --> 01:30:14,844
That's the time required
to render any information useless.

781
01:30:15,806 --> 01:30:20,243
How should we question suspects?

782
01:30:20,606 --> 01:30:24,360
Like the courts,
and take a few months over it?

783
01:30:24,766 --> 01:30:26,766
The legal way has its drawbacks.

784
01:30:26,766 --> 01:30:30,076
Is it legal to blow up public places?

785
01:30:31,006 --> 01:30:34,043
When you asked Ben M'Hidi,
what did he say?

786
01:30:35,966 --> 01:30:39,675
Believe me, it's a vicious circle.

787
01:30:41,406 --> 01:30:44,366
We could talk for hours
without reaching a conclusion.

788
01:30:44,366 --> 01:30:46,206
The problem is quite different.

789
01:30:46,206 --> 01:30:49,915
The FLN want to kick us out of Algeria,

790
01:30:50,246 --> 01:30:52,006
and we want to stay.

791
01:30:52,006 --> 01:30:57,286
Even though we have different ideas,
I think we all want to stay.

792
01:30:57,286 --> 01:31:01,326
When the rebellion started
there were no nuances.

793
01:31:01,326 --> 01:31:05,399
All the papers, even those of the left
wanted it suffocated.

794
01:31:06,166 --> 01:31:08,316
We're here for that.

795
01:31:08,846 --> 01:31:11,440
We are neither mad, nor sadists.

796
01:31:12,086 --> 01:31:18,002
They call us fascists, they forget
what we did in the resistance.

797
01:31:18,726 --> 01:31:23,242
They say Nazis, but some of us
survived Buchenwald.

798
01:31:23,926 --> 01:31:25,606
We are soldiers.

799
01:31:25,606 --> 01:31:27,483
Our duty is to win.

800
01:31:27,966 --> 01:31:29,843
Thus, to be quite clear,

801
01:31:30,846 --> 01:31:33,235
I'll ask you a question myself.

802
01:31:33,686 --> 01:31:35,642
Must France stay in Algeria?

803
01:31:37,326 --> 01:31:39,157
If the answer's still yes,

804
01:31:39,486 --> 01:31:42,284
you must accept all that this entails.

805
01:33:28,166 --> 01:33:29,486
He's a doctor.

806
01:33:29,486 --> 01:33:31,283
-Stabbed.
-Blast!

807
01:33:48,166 --> 01:33:50,043
No more ammo!

808
01:33:58,166 --> 01:33:59,155
Look there.

809
01:34:00,646 --> 01:34:02,566
Crush them!

810
01:34:02,566 --> 01:34:04,522
Kill them! Kill them!

811
01:34:14,126 --> 01:34:17,084
August 26th 1957

812
01:34:37,646 --> 01:34:40,046
Don't play the hero. It's not necessary.

813
01:34:40,046 --> 01:34:42,480
-The megaphone.
-Right.

814
01:34:47,166 --> 01:34:49,726
Ramel! Si Mourad!

815
01:34:50,846 --> 01:34:52,404
Be reasonable.

816
01:34:52,966 --> 01:34:56,197
I wouldn't like to be in your place
when we get you.

817
01:34:56,726 --> 01:34:59,445
You know we'll get you.

818
01:35:00,246 --> 01:35:02,123
Give yourselves up!

819
01:35:02,166 --> 01:35:04,760
I promise you'll not be touched,

820
01:35:05,726 --> 01:35:08,684
and you'll have a fair trial.
Do you hear?

821
01:35:09,166 --> 01:35:11,966
-Who's speaking?
-Mathieu.

822
01:35:11,966 --> 01:35:13,684
Colonel Mathieu.

823
01:35:14,086 --> 01:35:18,557
We don't trust you, come closer.

824
01:35:21,086 --> 01:35:24,476
-Show yourself.
-I don't trust you,

825
01:35:25,806 --> 01:35:28,726
stand, so that we can see you.

826
01:35:28,726 --> 01:35:31,365
With your hands in view.

827
01:35:31,606 --> 01:35:35,918
Okay, but the promise about the trial

828
01:35:36,206 --> 01:35:38,083
I want it in writing.

829
01:35:42,486 --> 01:35:45,326
A written declaration,

830
01:35:45,326 --> 01:35:46,918
then we'll surrender.

831
01:35:47,046 --> 01:35:49,401
How shall I pass it?

832
01:35:50,286 --> 01:35:52,754
We'll lower a basket.

833
01:35:53,606 --> 01:35:55,722
Fair enough, I'll write it.

834
01:36:23,646 --> 01:36:27,355
-That one?
-At this point.

835
01:36:33,246 --> 01:36:37,444
-Ready, Colonel?
-Yes, but first let's see you.

836
01:36:48,326 --> 01:36:50,999
60, 59,

837
01:36:51,846 --> 01:36:54,235
58, 57,

838
01:36:55,246 --> 01:36:57,635
56, 55,

839
01:36:58,286 --> 01:37:02,199
54, 53, 52...

840
01:37:04,526 --> 01:37:06,244
We can see them. You can come.

841
01:37:13,246 --> 01:37:15,406
Here's the note.

842
01:37:15,406 --> 01:37:18,318
You know I keep my word.

843
01:37:19,846 --> 01:37:21,279
You go.

844
01:37:22,486 --> 01:37:24,681
Swine! He's done us.

845
01:37:32,406 --> 01:37:37,326
-7, 6, 5...
-Get a move on, blackface!

846
01:37:37,326 --> 01:37:40,246
Now you'll see how we get a move on.

847
01:37:40,246 --> 01:37:41,964
2, 1

848
01:37:46,926 --> 01:37:50,236
September 24th 1957
Burn everything, you never know.

849
01:38:02,966 --> 01:38:04,684
Who's Fathia?

850
01:38:06,566 --> 01:38:08,045
-You?
-I am.

851
01:38:08,686 --> 01:38:12,838
Go up and tell him to surrender,
or I'll blow the lot up.

852
01:38:13,566 --> 01:38:15,126
-Understand?
-Yes.

853
01:38:15,126 --> 01:38:17,720
Convince him, if you value your house.

854
01:38:19,246 --> 01:38:20,964
Stop, or he'll kill you.

855
01:38:22,766 --> 01:38:25,564
Kader, Fathia's coming up!

856
01:38:25,806 --> 01:38:27,683
Don't shoot.

857
01:38:28,726 --> 01:38:30,000
Go now.

858
01:38:41,726 --> 01:38:44,115
Kader, it's Fathia.

859
01:38:46,326 --> 01:38:51,923
They say, if you don't come down,
they'll blow up the house.

860
01:38:52,406 --> 01:38:55,246
-You can save yourselves.
-Tell the Colonel

861
01:38:55,246 --> 01:38:57,606
to blow up what he likes. Now, go.

862
01:38:57,606 --> 01:38:59,403
-Kader!
-Go!

863
01:39:06,646 --> 01:39:09,524
-Well?
-He says: blow it up.

864
01:39:10,206 --> 01:39:12,003
Go with the others.

865
01:39:14,166 --> 01:39:20,002
Put the plastic on the ceiling
under the hide-out, with a long fuse.

866
01:39:20,406 --> 01:39:23,557
You give covering fire while they work.

867
01:39:28,166 --> 01:39:32,557
Clear the house and check the rooms.

868
01:40:04,806 --> 01:40:09,163
It's quite pointless to die like this.

869
01:40:11,926 --> 01:40:14,366
Mathieu! If you give me your word,

870
01:40:14,366 --> 01:40:18,041
not to touch the others in this house,
we'll come down.

871
01:40:27,326 --> 01:40:29,999
If you'd made me blow it up,
I'd have been disappointed.

872
01:40:30,606 --> 01:40:31,925
Why?

873
01:40:32,726 --> 01:40:37,754
Your photograph and your record
have been on my table for months.

874
01:40:38,246 --> 01:40:40,840
I feel I know you.

875
01:40:42,286 --> 01:40:45,756
You don't seem the type
for empty gestures.

876
01:40:46,366 --> 01:40:48,880
You're happy to have me alive.

877
01:40:50,446 --> 01:40:54,326
-Certainly.
-I've made a mistake.

878
01:40:54,326 --> 01:40:57,326
I've given you
an unexpected advantage.

879
01:40:57,326 --> 01:41:01,006
No, but the satisfaction
of having guessed right

880
01:41:01,006 --> 01:41:05,124
is no longer an advantage.
The game's over.

881
01:41:06,086 --> 01:41:08,361
The FLN's lost.

882
01:41:12,206 --> 01:41:13,639
What has she said?

883
01:41:13,966 --> 01:41:16,241
That there's still Alì.

884
01:41:38,966 --> 01:41:40,926
-Mahmoud.
-I'm coming now.

885
01:41:40,926 --> 01:41:43,998
Be back right away.

886
01:41:50,166 --> 01:41:53,397
Come on, go to sleep.
There'll just be us tomorrow.

887
01:41:53,886 --> 01:41:59,404
Mahmoud, Hassiba, me...

888
01:42:02,086 --> 01:42:03,804
and you.

889
01:42:04,926 --> 01:42:06,962
No one else will come.

890
01:42:07,646 --> 01:42:12,242
You get out of the truck, first place
the bomb and then return quietly.

891
01:42:13,326 --> 01:42:16,875
Then Hassiba will go down,
then Mahmoud.

892
01:42:17,726 --> 01:42:18,715
Then me.

893
01:42:18,846 --> 01:42:22,316
We'll plant them all,
so they'll know we're still here.

894
01:43:07,046 --> 01:43:08,479
Wake up.

895
01:43:12,926 --> 01:43:15,679
Wake up,
you'll see some fireworks today.

896
01:43:21,526 --> 01:43:23,403
It's nearly time.

897
01:43:25,086 --> 01:43:27,126
-Hassiba.
-I'm ready.

898
01:43:27,126 --> 01:43:29,526
-There was a truck.
-I heard it.

899
01:43:29,526 --> 01:43:32,324
But if it's been Sadek
he'd be here now.

900
01:43:38,526 --> 01:43:41,404
-How's your wife?
-The same.

901
01:43:43,326 --> 01:43:45,044
Inside!

902
01:44:35,846 --> 01:44:38,644
Get out!

903
01:44:39,486 --> 01:44:42,000
What're you waiting for?

904
01:45:25,926 --> 01:45:27,518
-Ready?
-Yes.

905
01:45:29,806 --> 01:45:32,604
-Has he replied?
-Silence.

906
01:45:33,246 --> 01:45:36,841
-I thought so.
-I've cleared the house.

907
01:45:43,846 --> 01:45:45,916
We're blowing you up.

908
01:45:46,486 --> 01:45:48,204
Let the others out.

909
01:45:48,846 --> 01:45:53,158
The boy. He'll only go to reformatory.

910
01:45:55,246 --> 01:45:57,476
Why let him die?

911
01:46:02,846 --> 01:46:04,325
Let's go.

912
01:46:06,326 --> 01:46:08,237
He's still here?

913
01:46:23,086 --> 01:46:25,475
I'll give you 30 seconds.

914
01:46:26,166 --> 01:46:28,202
What do you hope for?

915
01:46:28,406 --> 01:46:30,476
You've already lost.

916
01:46:30,846 --> 01:46:33,235
30 seconds from now.

917
01:46:37,526 --> 01:46:39,562
Who wants can go out.

918
01:46:40,326 --> 01:46:42,999
-What are you doing?
-I'll not bargain.

919
01:46:50,406 --> 01:46:52,874
You four go down when I signal.

920
01:47:35,006 --> 01:47:36,644
Attention!

921
01:47:37,246 --> 01:47:39,441
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Sir.

922
01:47:42,046 --> 01:47:43,957
-Well?
-Ready.

923
01:48:08,126 --> 01:48:09,923
Get back.

924
01:48:11,166 --> 01:48:12,679
-Ready?
-Yes.

925
01:48:42,046 --> 01:48:45,436
Take photos and make a report.

926
01:48:53,406 --> 01:48:56,125
Now the taenia's without a head.

927
01:48:59,086 --> 01:49:05,166
-It's finished in Algiers.
-No more talk of the FLN for a time.

928
01:49:05,166 --> 01:49:07,166
For always.

929
01:49:07,166 --> 01:49:09,157
They're good folks.

930
01:49:09,446 --> 01:49:13,486
We lived together for 130 years,
we could continue.

931
01:49:13,486 --> 01:49:18,514
-There's not only Algiers.
-Right, nor just Algeria.

932
01:49:18,606 --> 01:49:22,440
That's true, but let's be content
with Algiers.

933
01:49:23,326 --> 01:49:26,398
Things are easier in the mountains.

934
01:49:32,926 --> 01:49:35,366
-Goodbye, Sir.
-Goodbye.

935
01:49:35,366 --> 01:49:39,245
Anyway, we'll be meeting
this afternoon for the report.

936
01:49:40,366 --> 01:49:43,164
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

937
01:49:44,406 --> 01:49:47,637
December 1 1th 1960

938
01:49:58,566 --> 01:50:01,444
It is not known why,

939
01:50:02,006 --> 01:50:04,646
but after two years of relative quiet,

940
01:50:04,646 --> 01:50:09,401
apart from guerrilla war
just in the mountains,

941
01:50:10,006 --> 01:50:12,046
trouble has broken out again.

942
01:50:12,046 --> 01:50:14,806
I've phoned Lausanne. Lausanne!

943
01:50:14,806 --> 01:50:18,162
I spoke with an FLN in exile,

944
01:50:18,886 --> 01:50:20,604
but he knows nothing.

945
01:50:41,846 --> 01:50:44,806
Their flags appeared for the first time
this morning.

946
01:50:44,806 --> 01:50:47,806
Green and white flags
with the crescent and the star.

947
01:50:47,806 --> 01:50:50,718
They must've sewn them on overnight.

948
01:50:51,326 --> 01:50:56,246
Flags, in a manner of speaking,
made from sheets, shirts, or rags.

949
01:50:56,246 --> 01:50:57,838
But they're flags.

950
01:51:37,366 --> 01:51:39,926
The situation's very tense today.

951
01:51:39,926 --> 01:51:43,521
Despite pressure from extremists,

952
01:51:43,806 --> 01:51:47,686
it seems the Government's ordered
arms not to be used,

953
01:51:47,686 --> 01:51:49,642
except in the last resort.

954
01:51:50,046 --> 01:51:53,966
In the afternoon there were attempts
to break through

955
01:51:53,966 --> 01:51:56,560
towards the European quarter,
with some deaths.

956
01:51:57,646 --> 01:51:59,806
But calm has now returned

957
01:51:59,806 --> 01:52:04,163
even thought from the Kasbah we continue to hear incomprehensible cries.

958
01:52:04,246 --> 01:52:06,396
Rhythmic, nightmarish.

959
01:53:47,166 --> 01:53:50,954
The surprising unanimity
of these demonstrations

960
01:53:51,286 --> 01:53:54,915
has had a marked effect
on French public opinion.

961
01:53:55,286 --> 01:53:59,916
According to news from Paris,
the more sensitive political groups

962
01:54:00,086 --> 01:54:04,637
are beginning to look for a new line
on relations with Algeria.

963
01:54:08,726 --> 01:54:12,036
December 21st 1960
Last day of demonstration.

964
01:54:12,926 --> 01:54:14,803
Break it up!

965
01:54:16,046 --> 01:54:18,162
Return to your homes!

966
01:54:21,046 --> 01:54:23,276
What do you hope for?

967
01:55:41,046 --> 01:55:44,834
Another two years must pass,
with numerous deaths.

968
01:55:45,166 --> 01:55:48,246
Then, on the 2nd July 1962,

969
01:55:48,246 --> 01:55:51,477
independence is obtained
and the Algerian nation is born.
