1
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,069
-Is this the last one?
-I don't know.

2
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,159
There's no ether, either.

3
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,909
Jesus Christ.

4
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,159
You there! Is this the last one?

5
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,999
God, what a mess.

6
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,169
At least there's no gangrene.

7
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,089
There will be if it doesn't come off soon.

8
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,139
I can't saw if I can't keep my eyes open.

9
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,969
I'm sorry.

10
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,439
Let's coffee up. He can wait a few more minutes.

11
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,759
God!

12
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,179
Glass.

13
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,809
-Is that Tucker's men?
-Yes, sir. I think it is.

14
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,019
How long has it been like this?

15
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,989
We found 'em this morning, sir.
They've been here for two days.

16
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,329
Is that you, Lieutenant?

17
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,419
Sons of bitches.

18
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,429
Come on. You better take cover.

19
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,269
I ain't kidding. These boys are shooters.
Come on. Go under cover.

20
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,389
There you go.

21
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,229
You went to the hospital?

22
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,359
It was no good.

23
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,779
What's going on here?

24
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,909
What's going on here?

25
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,869
That seems to be the question, all right.

26
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,749
See, you could ask the major...

27
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,129
...but he don't know.

28
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,549
He's busy.

29
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,509
He's busy trying to figure out
how come the officers' mess...

30
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,589
...run out of peach ice cream.

31
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,389
Then, of course, you got the general.

32
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,679
He come up to see the show.

33
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,809
All he knows is there ain't no show...

34
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,019
...which ain't entirely correct
'cause we started a balloon up...

35
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,769
...but they shot her down
before we got off the ground.

36
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,439
Nobody's made a run either way.
It's been a standoff all damned day.

37
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,529
Now, the major, he's looking at the general.

38
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,829
He's thinking to himself,
'I better do something.'

39
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,499
You know what that means.

40
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,709
I sure as hell don't want to be
the first one across this field.

41
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,289
They're supposed to be beat up just like us.

42
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,879
Hell, everybody knows
Tucker's men are tough as cobs.

43
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,139
So far, the only thing been killed out here
is three milking cows.

44
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,309
Course, that's about to change.

45
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,099
You son of a bitch.

46
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,529
You know, some of the boys are saying
if we ain't gonna fight...

47
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,609
...we could just settle
this whole business with a little...

48
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,449
...high stakes poker.

49
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,449
Wouldn't that be a sight?

50
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,999
A bunch of fellas
sitting in the middle of this field...

51
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,369
...drawing cards.

52
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,259
What is it, sir?

53
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,799
Looks like a suicide.

54
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,799
Tucker!

55
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,939
What's he doing?

56
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,809
-What did you say to him?
-I didn't say nothing.

57
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,999
Come on back, you son of a bitch!

58
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,379
-You won't make it no second time!
-All right by me.

59
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,589
Forgive me, Father.

60
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,309
-He's coming back again!
-Here he comes, boys!

61
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,089
-Ready!
-I got him.

62
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,569
Don't....

63
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,659
Don't take off my foot.

64
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,959
You rest easy, son. You'll keep your foot.

65
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,959
With God as my judge, you'll keep it.

66
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,179
-Bring up my ambulance.
-Sir?

67
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,509
Bring up my ambulance,
and bring my surgeon with it!

68
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,019
We got an officer
who's worth something lying here.

69
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,089
"The strangeness of this life
cannot be measured.

70
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,919
"In trying to produce my own death...

71
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,799
"...I was elevated to the status of a living hero.

72
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,759
"I was also awarded Cisco...

73
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,809
"...the trusty mount that carried
me across the field that day.

74
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:27,809
"And on full recovery,
was given transfer to any station I desired.

75
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,809
"The bloody slaughter continues in the east
as I arrive at Fort Hayes.

76
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,609
"A tiny island of men and material
surrounded by a never-ending sea of prairie."

77
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,879
Lieutenant.

78
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,109
Where can I find Maj. Fambrough?

79
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,779
Down at the end of the hall.

80
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,199
Thank you.

81
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,879
"Lt. John J. Dunbar."

82
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,589
Lt. John J. Dunbar?

83
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,299
-Yes, sir.
-"Yes, sir."

84
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,309
Indian fighter.

85
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,559
Excuse me?

86
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,139
It says here that you're
to be posted on the frontier.

87
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,559
The frontier is Indian country.

88
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,149
I quickly deduced that you're an Indian fighter.

89
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,859
I did not ascend to this position
by being stupid.

90
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,819
-No, sir.
-"No, sir."

91
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,039
It says here that you've been decorated.

92
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,409
Yes, sir.

93
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,249
And they sent you here to be posted?

94
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,039
Actually, sir, I'm here at my own request.

95
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,999
Really? Why?

96
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,669
I've always wanted to see the frontier.

97
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,759
You want to see the frontier?

98
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,929
Yes, sir.

99
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,429
Before it's gone.

100
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,939
Such a smart lad, coming straight to me.

101
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,609
Sir...

102
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,449
...Knight.

103
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,539
I am sending you on a knight's errand.

104
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,119
You will report to Captain Cargill...

105
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,169
...at the furthermost outpost of the realm...

106
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,339
...Fort Sedgewick.

107
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,549
My personaI seaI will assure your safety...

108
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,179
...through many miles
of wild and hostile country.

109
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,149
-I was wondering....
-Yes?

110
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:06,319
I was wondering, sir, how will I be getting there?

111
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,029
You think I don't know?

112
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,119
-No, sir.
-You think that.

113
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,409
-It's just that I don't know--
-Hold your tongue.

114
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,079
I am in a generous mood
and I will grant your boon.

115
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,209
See that peasant out there?

116
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,129
He calls himself Timmons.

117
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:24,129
He's going there this very afternoon.
You can ride with him if you like.

118
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,759
He knows the way. Thank you. That is all.

119
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,859
Sir Knight?

120
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,899
I've just pissed in my pants...

121
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,489
...and nobody can do anything about it.

122
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,669
To your journey!

123
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,099
To my journey!

124
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,989
Haw!

125
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,449
Over a little bit, Jim!

126
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,829
-Have this by tomorrow.
-Yes, sir.

127
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,839
I'll have my crown now.

128
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,089
-Sir?
-I'll have my crown now!

129
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,339
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Are you deaf, fool?

130
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,849
I said I'll have my crown right now!

131
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,009
Now!

132
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,399
No.

133
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,729
-I'll get your crown.
-No.

134
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,949
Sir?

135
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,829
Major?

136
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,089
The king is dead.

137
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,629
Long live the king.

138
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,989
Get these kids out of here, come on!

139
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,339
Haw, Jim and Jake!

140
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,889
Gee a little bit, Jim!

141
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,949
The hell was that?

142
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,829
What is that?

143
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,339
What the hell is that?

144
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,989
Why don't you put that in your book?

145
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,249
"Were it not for my companion...

146
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,959
"...I believe I would be having the time of my life.

147
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,419
"I know he means well...

148
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,799
"...but he is quite possibly
the foulest man I have ever met."

149
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,669
How far you make the Fort?

150
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,169
Far.

151
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,219
How far?

152
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,179
Forty, fifty mile, maybe.

153
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,389
What's the big hurry on Sedgewick?

154
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,979
It's to be my post.

155
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,519
My home.

156
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,399
You ain't hard to please, I'll give you that much.

157
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,159
Look yonder.

158
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,259
What you got there?

159
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,809
Somebody back east is saying,
"Why don't she write?"

160
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,979
You stupid bastard.

161
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,269
Get up, Timmons.

162
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,399
Get up.

163
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,999
Get up.

164
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,749
Come on. Get up.

165
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,719
Get up!

166
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,519
Someone poked me in my butt. Was that you?

167
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,269
Goddamn it!

168
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,479
I'm gonna have a welt.

169
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,719
CorporaI Guest?

170
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,659
You don't have to talk to me,
just please come out.

171
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,179
It's the end.

172
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,469
Assemble the men in front of my quarters.

173
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,029
You hate me.

174
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,449
But I feeI none of the same for you.

175
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,869
You men stayed.

176
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,369
You stayed after they took all our horses.

177
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,089
You stayed after all the others deserted.

178
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:16,089
You stayed after the army failed to resupply us.

179
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,809
I have looked for that wagon from Fort Hayes...

180
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,479
...just as you have...

181
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,889
...day after miserable day.

182
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,689
And all I can say is that I'm proud of you.

183
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:37,819
Now get your things, men.
We're leaving this place.

184
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,409
The army can go to hell.

185
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,709
Go.

186
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,539
Get your things.

187
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,669
How come we haven't seen any buffalo?

188
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,129
You can't figure the stinking buffalo.

189
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:35,499
You can't.
Sometimes you won't see any for days.

190
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:38,929
Other times, they'll be thick,
like curls on a whore.

191
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,639
What about Indians?

192
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,059
Indians? Goddamn Indians!

193
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:49,979
You just as soon not see 'em
unless the bastards are dead.

194
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,519
They're nothing but thieves and beggars.

195
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,229
Ho, up there!

196
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,909
Not what you would call
much of a going concern now, is it?

197
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,959
Go down there.

198
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,079
-Why? There ain't nothing down there.
-Because I said.

199
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,749
Go down there.

200
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,549
There, son of a bitch!

201
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,079
There ain't nothing here, Lieutenant.

202
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:37,099
There ain't nothing here, Lieutenant.

203
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,279
Lieutenant!

204
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,949
Everybody's run off or got killed.

205
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,549
All right. Let's unload the wagon.

206
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,549
What? What, and leave it all here?

207
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,809
I'm staying, too.

208
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,229
There ain't nothing here.

209
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,349
No, not at the moment.

210
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,819
We don't know what's happened.

211
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,149
Things being as they are...

212
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,989
...we might as well
just turn around and get headed back.

213
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,529
This is my post.

214
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,869

218
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,339
What, are you crazy, boy?

219
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,669

220

-Jesus H. Christ.
-This is my post.

221
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,049
All right, put it down.

222
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,889
And these are the post provisions, all right?
Now get your ass off the wagon--

223
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:58,059
-Put it down!
-And help me unload.

224
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,899
We're just havin' a conversation,
now put it down.

225
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,319
I'll let them know where you are.

226
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:56,079
Good.

227

Good luck.

Come on, Cisco. One more time.

255
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,569
Git up!

We have no rifles.

It's hard to say how many might be down there.

00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,969
"When I appeared,
he became frightened and ran off.

327
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,889
"Have decided to bury excess ordnance
lest it fall into enemy hands.

328
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:15,099
"Keeping only the barest necessities for myself.

329
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:23,819
"My afternoon rides have been pared down
to short circular patrols...

330
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:26,069
"...always keeping the post in sight.

331
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:30,199
"Am taking steps to prepare
for another visitation.

332
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:32,869
"Do not know how many more
might be in the vicinity...

333
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:36,419
"...but am assuming that where there is one
there's sure to be another.

334
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:42,209
"Most of my work has been geared
toward creating the illusion...

335
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,179
"...of strength and stability.

336
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:48,929
"I'm still alone, however,
and unless troops arrive soon...

337
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:50,559
"...all may be lost."

338
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:10,739
Kicking Bird has been keeping to himself
these last few days.

339
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:16,369
I do not like to see our medicine man
walking so alone.

340
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:20,959
What does his wife say?

341
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:23,759
She says that he is keeping to himself.

342
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,339
That's not what I asked you.

343
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:28,049
Well, what did you ask me?

344
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:30,219
What did she say?

345
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:33,519
She said that he is keeping
to himself these days.

346
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:36,769
That's what she says.

347
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:41,069
Make sure that my meat is soft.

348
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:43,479
My teeth hurt.

349
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,619
May I come in?

350
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:11,299
No, let him sit with me.

351
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:19,269
Our country seems good this summer...

352
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:23,769
...but I have not been out to see it.

353
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:28,649
But the buffalo are late.

354
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:32,329
And I always worry
about the bellies of our children.

355
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:37,999
I was thinking of a dance.

356
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:41,879
Yes. A dance is always a good idea.

357
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:47,209
It would be good to have a strong sign.

358
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:05,069
There's a funny thing about signs.

359
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:07,739
We know when they are bad or good.

360
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:13,529
Sometimes they are strange
and it's hard to understand them.

361
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:16,409
A smart man will think on these things.

362
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:21,539
If he is still confused, he will tell somebody.

363
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,209
For instance, he might tell you or me.

364
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:26,249
A smart man always does this.

365
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:34,759
I have seen such a sign.

366
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:37,309
Really?

367
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,739
I saw a man.

368
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:56,869
A naked white man.

369
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:58,579
Are you sure it was a man?

370
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:02,999
I saw his sex.

371
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:06,879
Did you speak to him?

372
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:10,759
No.

373
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:28,149
"It's been two days now, and nothing.

374
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:31,279
"My presence here must
have been reported by now.

375
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:34,239
"Have made all the preparations I can think of.

376
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,819
"Cannot mount an adequate defense
as I am still alone.

377
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:39,579
"But will try to make
a big impression when they come.

378
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:40,949
"Waiting.

379
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:42,749
"Post-script....

380
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:46,289
"The man I encountered was
a magnificent looking fellow."

381
01:00:57,140 --> 01:01:01,019
He might be a god.

382
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:05,979
Or a white chief with speciaI powers.

383
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:08,399
That is why we should talk with him.

384
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:13,819
I do not care for this talk about this white man.

385
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:17,739
Whatever he is, he is not a Sioux,
and that makes him less.

386
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:22,199
When I hear that more whites are coming,
I want to laugh.

387
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,579
We took a hundred horses from these people.

388
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:27,039
There was no honor in it.

389
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:29,839
They don't ride well. They don't shoot well.

390
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:32,709
They're dirty.

391
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:36,549
Those soldiers could not even make it
through one winter here.

392
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,599
And these people are said to flourish?

393
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,179
I think they will all be dead soon.

394
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,269
I think this fooI is probably lost.

395
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:57,319
Wind In His Hair's words are strong
and I have heard them.

396
01:01:57,410 --> 01:02:00,369
It's true the whites are a poor race
and hard to understand.

397
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:03,829
But make no mistake. The whites are coming.

398
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:06,039
Even our enemies agree on this.

399
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,749
So when I see one man alone
without fear in our country...

400
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:14,589
...I do not think he is lost.
I think he may have medicine.

401
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:18,089
I see someone who might speak...

402
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:21,429
...for all the white people who are coming.

403
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:25,809
I think this is a person
with which treaties might be struck.

404
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:35,109
Kicking Bird is always looking ahead
and that is good.

405
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:39,359
But this man cannot cover our lodges
or feed our children.

406
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:43,199
He is nothing to us.

407
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,039
I will take some men.

408
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,249
We will shoot some arrows into this white man.

409
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:50,919
If he truly has medicine, he will not be hurt.

410
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,749
If he has no medicine, he will be dead.

411
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:02,679
No man can tell another what to do.

412
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,139
But killing a white man is a delicate matter.

413
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:10,269
If you kill one, more are sure to come.

414
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:20,279
It's easy to become confused
by these questions.

415
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,909
It's hard to know what to do.

416
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:28,409
We should talk about this some more.

417
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:32,249
That is all I have to say.

418
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:09,199
What's the matter, now?

419
01:04:09,290 --> 01:04:11,959
We don't think this is such a good idea.

420
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:15,039
If we take the horse of a white god...

421
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:17,339
...they will make up songs about us.

422
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:19,339
Maybe.

423
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:22,759
They will ask us to go on raids.

424
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:25,849
Who gets the horse?

425
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:26,929
I do.

426
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:33,349
I do, but we share. Now who can say
this is not a great plan?

427
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,609
It's always the same.

428
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,189
Every time.

429
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:51,079
Yes, sir, I have. No, I'll ask, sir.

430
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:18,059
We'll be heroes.

431
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:23,399
They'll write songs about us.

432
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:38,579
What happened?

433
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:46,929
I don't know. My arm doesn't work.

434
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:53,269
You shouldn't have fallen off.
Now we'll get in trouble.

435
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:55,939
It was your idea.

436
01:05:56,020 --> 01:06:01,479
My idea was only to take the horse,
not fall down.

437
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:08,109
Otter hurt himself.

438
01:06:11,330 --> 01:06:13,329
What are you looking at?
I'm the one who's hurt.

439
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:17,829
I will be when my father finds out.
His bow will be across my back.

440
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:44,689
I am Wind In His Hair.

441
01:08:45,810 --> 01:08:48,319
I am Wind In His Hair.

442
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:52,739
Do you see that I am not afraid of you?

443
01:08:52,990 --> 01:08:54,449
Do you see?

444
01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:11,069
The party that went against the Utes
is coming back.

445
01:10:11,730 --> 01:10:15,189
There are many hearts on the ground.

446
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:52,999
"I realize now that I have been wrong.

447
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,999
"All this time, I've been waiting.

448
01:11:55,090 --> 01:11:56,629
"Waiting for what?

449
01:11:56,670 --> 01:11:58,169
"Forsomeone to find me?

450
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:00,089
"For Indians to take my horse?

451
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:01,799
"To see a buffalo?

452
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:05,179
"Since I have arrived at this post
I have been walking on eggs.

453
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:08,099
"It has become a bad habit and I am sick ofit.

454
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:10,599
"Tomorrow morning,
I will ride out to the Indians.

455
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:13,269
"I do not know the outcome
or wisdom of this thinking...

456
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:16,939
"...but I've become a target
and a target makes a poor impression.

457
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:18,819
"I am through waiting."

458
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:21,819
What are you looking at?

459
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:54,159
Son of a bitch!

460
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:08,429
No. Wait.

461
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:10,599
Wait.

462
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:14,099
Wait.

463
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,149
You need help. You're hurt.

464
01:14:19,230 --> 01:14:21,269
-You need--
-No!

465
01:14:23,190 --> 01:14:25,779
Let me.... You need help.

466
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:29,119
You need help. You're hurt. Let me help you.

467
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:34,999
You're hurt.

468
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:41,339
Don't.

469
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:01,909
She's hurt.

470
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:09,789
She's hurt.

471
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:23,139
You are not welcome here.

472
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:29,149
No. She's hurt.

473
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:33,729
Go away.

474
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:45,659
You are not welcome. Go away.

475
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,959
Stop.

476
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:33,249
The soldier did not come to fight.

477
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:36,589
He is going away and we will let him.

478
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:05,409
I am in agreement with Kicking Bird.

479
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:08,959
We will go down and talk to the white man.

480
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:13,039
And find out why he is here.

481
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:25,219
lf this counciI decides to talk to the white man...

482
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:27,519
...then it will be so.

483
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,559
But in my mind it's not right...

484
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,439
...that a chief as great as Ten Bears...

485
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,649
...goes to ask the business of a puny,
trespassing white man...

486
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:39,439
...who has only a smart horse
and a few white man's clothes.

487
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:42,909
I will not go.

488
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:45,619
You will go.

489
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:53,499
And you will go.

490
01:20:54,630 --> 01:20:57,549
That is all I have to say.

491
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:19,359
Welcome.

492
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,569
Welcome.

493
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:24,779
Hi!

494
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,079
Come.

495
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,579
Please, sit down.

496
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:37,669
Sit down.

497
01:22:02,530 --> 01:22:04,609
Wait just a.... Just a minute.

498
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:11,789
His mind is gone.

499
01:22:39,730 --> 01:22:41,399
Tatanka. Buffalo.

500
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,239
-Buffalo.
-Tatanka.

501
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:53,579
Buffalo. Tatanka.

502
01:22:56,330 --> 01:22:59,669
"The fierce one, as I call him,
seems a very tough fellow.

503
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:01,589
"I hope I never have to fight him.

504
01:23:01,670 --> 01:23:05,259
"From the little I know,
he seems to be honest and very direct.

505
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:07,549
"I like the quiet one immensely.

506
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:09,549
"He's been patient and inquisitive.

507
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:11,719
"He seems eager to communicate.

508
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:15,059
"I would conclude that he is a man
of some weight among his people."

509
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:16,389
Buffalo.

510
01:23:24,530 --> 01:23:27,739
"I believe I made an even greater impression
on their next visit.

511
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:32,029
"I produced a coffee grinder,
something none of them had seen before."

512
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:15,529
ls the coffee not good?

513
01:24:16,830 --> 01:24:18,409
It's too strong, maybe.

514
01:24:21,330 --> 01:24:22,499
Sugar.

515
01:24:23,670 --> 01:24:24,839
Put in.

516
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:35,889
Taste it.

517
01:24:47,230 --> 01:24:48,399
Sugar.

518
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:50,949
You want some?

519
01:24:51,530 --> 01:24:52,989
You want some?

520
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,499
That's a lot.

521
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:07,879
Okay.

522
01:25:08,630 --> 01:25:09,629
Yeah.

523
01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:16,429
"It's good to finally have some company.

524
01:25:16,510 --> 01:25:19,469
"So much goes unsaid
and I have the feeling that these people...

525
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:22,389
"...the quiet one in particular,
want something from me.

526
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,849
"Made presents of coffee and most of the sugar.

527
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:27,189
"It didn't figure to last anyway.

528
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:29,109
"Don't believe I go too far in saying...

529
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:31,989
"...that a foundation
for good relations is being laid."

530
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:09,649
Stands With A Fist.

531
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,949
We will talk awhile.

532
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:27,419
Your wounds are healing well?

533
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:31,499
Yes, they are.

534
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:37,339
You are happy here, with my family?

535
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:39,759
I am glad to be here.

536
01:26:40,470 --> 01:26:43,979
I am missing my husband.

537
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:49,769
Perhaps you will marry again
when the time is right?

538
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:51,189
Perhaps.

539
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:01,619
We have word from many places
that the whites are coming.

540
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:05,409
They are coming into everyone's country.

541
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:07,579
I think they will soon be in ours.

542
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:10,459
This white man
who lives at the old soldier fort....

543
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:13,499
I have visited him
and I believe his heart is a good one.

544
01:27:20,010 --> 01:27:22,809
I am afraid of the white man at the fort.

545
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:27,269
I am afraid he will tell others that I am here.

546
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:29,689
I am afraid they will try to kidnap me.

547
01:27:29,770 --> 01:27:32,819
I've heard they kidnap people.

548
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:35,609
Every warrior in camp
would fight them if they tried.

549
01:27:35,690 --> 01:27:38,399
I cannot speak the white man's language.

550
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:40,739
He cannot speak Lakota.

551
01:27:41,870 --> 01:27:45,159
It's been a long time since I spoke it.

552
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,289
I want you to try.

553
01:27:47,910 --> 01:27:49,539
I don't know how.

554
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:51,129
Yes, you do.

555
01:27:51,210 --> 01:27:52,839
I can't.

556
01:27:54,090 --> 01:27:56,339
I can't. It's dead in me.

557
01:27:57,380 --> 01:28:01,799
I don't ask this for myself.
I ask this for all of us.

558
01:28:01,890 --> 01:28:05,009
He knows things about the whites
that we don't.

559
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:07,479
Now, you must remember.

560
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:12,859
I can't.

561
01:28:23,570 --> 01:28:26,739
Will she speak the white language?

562
01:28:27,950 --> 01:28:30,749
She won't try. She is being difficult.

563
01:28:31,330 --> 01:28:33,919
Well, she's the one who's crying.

564
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,379
Perhaps the difficulty is yours.

565
01:29:43,780 --> 01:29:45,109
Christine!

566
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:02,969
Get 'em, Joe! Get them chickens!

567
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:08,299
Billy, you get away from those puppies!

568
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:16,059
Damn!

569
01:30:16,690 --> 01:30:19,319
Get the kids, and get them in the house.

570
01:30:20,650 --> 01:30:21,819
Go on!

571
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:25,569
Christine!

572
01:30:26,530 --> 01:30:29,239
Christine! Where are you?

573
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,869
I'm up here, mother.

574
01:30:32,950 --> 01:30:34,869
-Get down now.
-Why?

575
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,329
Just do it.

576
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:48,009
Stay right where you are. Get back.
Do you hear me?

577
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:51,349
Joe, get in the house right now!

578
01:30:58,350 --> 01:30:59,519
Willie!

579
01:31:00,150 --> 01:31:03,569
-Who is it, Willie?
-They look like Pawnee.

580
01:31:03,610 --> 01:31:06,569
My father and your father are talking to them.

581
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:09,869
-What do they want?
-I don't know.

582
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:13,289
Go on. You heard him. Get out of here.

583
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,879
Run, Christine!

584
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:30,219
I said run!

585
01:31:32,930 --> 01:31:34,349
Joe!

586
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:51,699
Christine!

587
01:32:03,670 --> 01:32:05,129
Mommy!

588
01:32:44,130 --> 01:32:46,959
Come on, Two Socks. Bacon.

589
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,299
"Two Socks, like Cisco,
has become a trusted friend.

590
01:32:50,470 --> 01:32:52,639
"He still won't eat from my hand...

591
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:56,969
"...but his keen eyes and ears
never faiI to alert me when something is wrong."

592
01:33:22,330 --> 01:33:23,539
Tatanka.

593
01:33:25,630 --> 01:33:26,629
No.

594
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:29,049
No, I haven't seen any buffalo.

595
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:31,089
Sorry.

596
01:33:50,030 --> 01:33:52,069
Are you hungry?

597
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:55,489
Are you hungry?

598
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:59,239
I have food. I have a lot of food.

599
01:34:22,890 --> 01:34:25,689
"Nothing I've been told
about these people is correct.

600
01:34:25,770 --> 01:34:27,519
"They are not beggars and thieves.

601
01:34:27,610 --> 01:34:30,479
"They are not the bogeymen
they've been made out to be.

602
01:34:30,610 --> 01:34:34,859
"On the contrary, they are polite guests
and have a familiar humor I enjoy.

603
01:34:34,950 --> 01:34:37,069
"ReaI communication is slow, however...

604

"...and the quiet one is as frustrated as I am.

605

"Most of our progress
has been built on the basis of failure...

606

"...rather than success.

607
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,919
"I've thought to inquire
if the woman I found lived or not...

608
01:34:49,170 --> 01:34:52,919
"...but it seems far too complicated a subject,
given our limitations.

609

"One thing is clear, however.
There are no buffalo.

610
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:58,259
"And it weighs heavy on their minds.

613
01:36:33,230 --> 01:36:34,729
We were waiting for you.

614
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:50,079
We were waiting for you.

615

Now tell him we're glad that he's here.

616
01:36:59,090 --> 01:37:00,379
Hello.

617

Good.

01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:14,189
Thank you. I feeI good.

621
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:15,899
I feeI good.

622
01:37:18,990 --> 01:37:22,779
Ask him why he is at the soldier fort.

623
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:30,869
The soldier fort.

624
01:37:31,710 --> 01:37:32,829
Wait.

625
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,629
What is your names?

626
01:37:37,710 --> 01:37:40,629
-Our names?
-What is his name?

627
01:37:45,470 --> 01:37:50,889
He's right. Introductions should come first.

628
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:54,769
He....

629
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,769

Kick.

631
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:01,989
Kick?

632
01:38:02,570 --> 01:38:03,609
More.

633
01:38:03,990 --> 01:38:05,109
More kick?

634
01:38:05,530 --> 01:38:06,989
More kicking?

635
01:38:07,450 --> 01:38:08,659
Kicking.

636
01:38:10,830 --> 01:38:13,329
Bird? Bird, kicking bird.

637
01:38:13,410 --> 01:38:15,079
Kicking Bird.

638
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:21,709

No.

A holy man.

642
01:38:41,610 --> 01:38:43,529
Holy man.

643
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:49,279
Your name?

644

-I don't--
-How are you called?

645
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:26,609
Get up?

646
01:39:31,410 --> 01:39:32,539
Stand up?

Stands?

Stands. Your name's "Stands"?

02:19:59,690 --> 02:20:01,859
"I sense I made a mistake in doing so...

812
02:20:01,940 --> 02:20:04,819
"...but I could not bring myself to take it back.

813
02:20:04,860 --> 02:20:07,569
"They are my friends,
and from what little I gather...

814
02:20:07,660 --> 02:20:10,159
"...the Pawnee have been
very hard on these people.

815
02:20:10,240 --> 02:20:12,949
"I hope I have not overstepped my bounds."

816
02:20:17,380 --> 02:20:18,959
Come in, please.

817
02:20:21,420 --> 02:20:22,669
Sit down?

818
02:20:26,180 --> 02:20:28,259
Kicking Bird want to know...

819
02:20:28,340 --> 02:20:31,929
...why you want to make war on the Pawnee.

820
02:20:32,560 --> 02:20:35,269
They have done nothing to you.

821
02:20:35,940 --> 02:20:37,809
They are Sioux enemies.

822
02:20:45,360 --> 02:20:48,109
Only Sioux warriors to go.

823
02:20:49,070 --> 02:20:50,949
Tell him that I have been a warrior...

824
02:20:51,030 --> 02:20:54,369
...longer than many of the young men
who will go on this war party.

825
02:20:54,830 --> 02:20:56,079
Tell him.

826
02:21:10,680 --> 02:21:13,929
He said that the Sioux way of being a warrior...

827
02:21:14,020 --> 02:21:15,929
...is not the white way.

828
02:21:16,520 --> 02:21:20,559
-You are not ready.
-I know, I understand.

829
02:21:20,610 --> 02:21:23,189
Tell him I cannot learn these ways in camp.

830
02:21:30,620 --> 02:21:32,779
He also asks that you...

831
02:21:33,790 --> 02:21:37,249
...watch over his family while he is gone.

832
02:21:38,250 --> 02:21:41,999
This thing he asks is a great honor for you.

833
02:21:45,550 --> 02:21:49,469
Tell him that I would be happy
to watch over his family.

834
02:21:55,890 --> 02:21:58,639
He thanks Dances With Wolves for coming.

835
02:22:00,140 --> 02:22:02,149
Who is Dances With Wolves?

836
02:22:04,110 --> 02:22:07,609
It is the name which all the people...

837
02:22:07,690 --> 02:22:09,489
...are calling you now.

838
02:22:10,030 --> 02:22:11,529
Dances With....

839
02:22:12,990 --> 02:22:14,489
That's right.

840
02:22:14,910 --> 02:22:16,199
That day.

841
02:22:17,450 --> 02:22:19,119
Dances With Wolves.

842
02:22:20,790 --> 02:22:22,459
How do you say it?

843
02:23:22,230 --> 02:23:27,689
Keep on with the white man talk if it pleases you.

844
02:23:27,770 --> 02:23:30,239
I like to make the talk.

845
02:24:10,860 --> 02:24:12,109
I'm here.

846
02:24:15,280 --> 02:24:16,699
We walk.

847
02:24:49,810 --> 02:24:51,359
I cut this off.

848
02:24:52,360 --> 02:24:54,649
I shaved it off. More.

849
02:24:56,820 --> 02:24:58,949
Grass grows on the prairie.

850
02:24:58,990 --> 02:25:00,489
"Grass grows on the prairie"?

851
02:25:02,740 --> 02:25:04,199
-Wrong.
-Wrong?

852
02:25:04,290 --> 02:25:06,459
You said, "Fire lives on the prairie."

853
02:25:06,500 --> 02:25:07,749
I did?

854
02:25:08,420 --> 02:25:11,379
No laughing, though.

855
02:25:15,380 --> 02:25:18,219
That man is a fighter.

856
02:25:22,470 --> 02:25:23,679
Again.

857
02:25:24,470 --> 02:25:27,849
-That man is a fighter.
-Okay, I have it.

858
02:25:31,520 --> 02:25:32,649
Yes.

859
02:25:40,070 --> 02:25:41,819
Hoo hoo, right?

860
02:25:47,370 --> 02:25:48,329
No?

861
02:25:57,470 --> 02:25:58,799
Try this.

862
02:26:01,050 --> 02:26:02,719
What's the word...

863
02:26:03,260 --> 02:26:04,809
...for beautiful?

864
02:26:10,060 --> 02:26:12,309
What are you doing?

865
02:26:12,400 --> 02:26:16,149
It's hot, and we are sitting in the shade.

866
02:26:20,570 --> 02:26:22,569
I'm hungry.

867
02:26:40,340 --> 02:26:43,049
How is Dances With Wolves?

868
02:26:45,140 --> 02:26:47,309
What do you mean?

869
02:26:48,520 --> 02:26:51,059
How is he learning?

870
02:26:51,850 --> 02:26:55,569
He is a fast learner.

871
02:26:55,650 --> 02:26:58,529
What did you think I meant?

872
02:27:18,670 --> 02:27:20,799
You go for water, today?

873
02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:28,679
Then let us take you.

874
02:27:43,990 --> 02:27:46,029
How did you get your name?

875
02:27:50,330 --> 02:27:53,249
I was not very old...

876
02:27:54,210 --> 02:27:56,669
...when I came to be with the people.

877
02:27:57,500 --> 02:27:59,419
And I was made to work.

878
02:28:00,550 --> 02:28:02,669
I worked every day, very hard.

879
02:28:04,430 --> 02:28:07,799
There was a woman...

880
02:28:07,850 --> 02:28:09,849
...who didn't like me much.

881
02:28:11,430 --> 02:28:15,519
She used to call me bad names,
and sometimes she....

882
02:28:20,110 --> 02:28:21,359
Beat me?

883
02:28:25,360 --> 02:28:27,119
And one day, she was...

884
02:28:27,950 --> 02:28:30,159
...calling me these bad names...

885
02:28:30,540 --> 02:28:33,079
...with her face in my face...

886
02:28:34,040 --> 02:28:35,369
...and I hit her.

887
02:28:37,330 --> 02:28:40,459
I was not very big, but she fell down.

888
02:28:40,710 --> 02:28:42,919
She fell hard and didn't move.

889
02:28:44,340 --> 02:28:47,719
And then I stood over her with my fist...

890
02:28:47,930 --> 02:28:49,259
...and I asked if...

891
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:51,969
...there was any other woman...

892
02:28:52,560 --> 02:28:54,849
...who wanted to call me bad names.

893
02:28:56,770 --> 02:28:59,189
No one bothered me after that day.

894
02:29:02,230 --> 02:29:05,239
No, I wouldn't think so.

895
02:29:10,330 --> 02:29:11,699
Show me.

896
02:29:12,740 --> 02:29:14,749
Show me where you hit her.

897
02:29:43,480 --> 02:29:45,439
Why are you not married?

898
02:29:49,490 --> 02:29:50,989
-I'm sorry.
-I have to go.

899
02:29:53,910 --> 02:29:55,249
I'm sorry.

900
02:29:57,410 --> 02:29:58,579
Can I help you?

901
02:30:28,900 --> 02:30:31,739
You are not talking today?

902
02:30:31,820 --> 02:30:33,529
No, I am not.

903
02:31:39,890 --> 02:31:46,019
Some of your words are wrong
but you are learning fast.

904
02:31:47,070 --> 02:31:51,399
So what can I tell you today?

905
02:31:52,610 --> 02:31:54,949
I want to know about Stands With A Fist.

906
02:31:55,030 --> 02:31:58,119
Why is there no man with her?

907
02:31:59,490 --> 02:32:02,209
She is in mourning.

908
02:32:04,750 --> 02:32:05,919
I don't....

909
02:32:07,250 --> 02:32:10,799
I do not understand "mourning."

910
02:32:12,340 --> 02:32:14,759
She cries for someone.

911
02:32:16,970 --> 02:32:19,389
Cries for who?

912
02:32:23,140 --> 02:32:26,019
lt is not polite to speak of the dead.

913
02:32:26,100 --> 02:32:30,069
But you are new, so I will tell you.

914
02:32:30,150 --> 02:32:32,439
She cries for her husband.

915
02:32:32,490 --> 02:32:34,609
He was killed not long ago.

916
02:32:34,700 --> 02:32:39,329
That is how you came to find her on the prairie.

917
02:32:42,700 --> 02:32:46,619
How long will she cry?

918
02:32:48,540 --> 02:32:53,459
lt is Kicking Bird's place
to say when she is finished.

919
02:32:53,800 --> 02:32:57,429
He's the one that found her
when she was very little.

920
02:33:15,150 --> 02:33:18,109
People are talking about you.

921
02:33:20,780 --> 02:33:22,829
What are they saying?

922
02:33:25,540 --> 02:33:27,749
They are proud of the medicine...

923
02:33:27,830 --> 02:33:31,289
...you're making with Dances With Wolves.

924
02:33:34,130 --> 02:33:38,429
I have hurt him, and I should go talk to him.

925
02:33:39,510 --> 02:33:42,219
You can't. He's gone.

926
02:33:43,060 --> 02:33:45,309
He left this morning.

927
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:12,409
Bet you were thinking:

928
02:36:12,500 --> 02:36:14,499
"Now, why don't he write?"

929
02:36:15,330 --> 02:36:16,999
Hello, Two Socks.

930
02:36:44,490 --> 02:36:45,739
Come on.

931
02:36:50,370 --> 02:36:53,959
I won't hurt you. Come on. You can do this.

932
02:36:54,330 --> 02:36:55,959
You can do this.

933
02:37:00,340 --> 02:37:01,499
Come on.

934
02:37:13,640 --> 02:37:15,099
This is easy.

935
02:37:15,640 --> 02:37:17,559
This is easy, Two Socks.

936
02:38:38,980 --> 02:38:40,649
I am in mourning.

937
02:38:49,990 --> 02:38:51,489
No, we cannot.

938
02:38:51,780 --> 02:38:54,699
-Yes.
-We must be careful.

939
02:38:56,740 --> 02:38:58,159
We must be careful.

940
02:38:58,250 --> 02:38:59,709
Okay.

941
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:04,599
Wait!

942
02:42:10,860 --> 02:42:11,939
What?

943
02:42:12,770 --> 02:42:13,979
Trouble.

944
02:42:37,630 --> 02:42:41,049
The Pawnee are coming.
A big party of 40 or 50 men this time.

945
02:42:41,140 --> 02:42:43,639
Hunters found them not far to the north.
Soon be here.

946
02:42:43,760 --> 02:42:47,809
Stone Calf, wait. I will follow you.

947
02:42:47,890 --> 02:42:50,769
The Pawnee do not come for horses.
They come for blood.

948
02:42:50,850 --> 02:42:52,809
Get your weapons and come to my lodge.

949
02:42:54,730 --> 02:42:55,939
I will get them.

950
02:42:56,690 --> 02:42:58,609
Stone Calf, wait.

951
02:42:58,700 --> 02:42:59,779
I have guns.

952
02:42:59,860 --> 02:43:02,319
I have many rifles.

953
02:43:04,490 --> 02:43:06,619
-At the fort?
-Yes.

954
02:43:07,330 --> 02:43:09,869
No. The ride is long and we can spare no men.

955
02:43:09,960 --> 02:43:13,079
Guns would make one warrior like two.

956
02:43:18,510 --> 02:43:21,719
Take one man and go quickly.

957
02:43:22,800 --> 02:43:25,349
I will take Smiles A Lot.

958
02:44:15,270 --> 02:44:16,269
Okay!

959
02:46:51,090 --> 02:46:52,599
Shoot the gun!

960
02:51:20,410 --> 02:51:22,529
"It was hard to know how to feel.

961
02:51:22,620 --> 02:51:25,199
"I'd never been in a battle like this one.

962
02:51:25,290 --> 02:51:27,949
"There was no dark politicaI objective.

963
02:51:28,040 --> 02:51:32,039
"This was not a fight for territory or riches
or to make men free.

964
02:51:32,130 --> 02:51:36,049
"It was fought to preserve the food stores
that would see us through the winter.

965
02:51:36,090 --> 02:51:40,549
"To protect the lives of women and children
and loved ones only a few feet away.

966
02:51:40,800 --> 02:51:44,469
"Stone Calf was a great loss,
but even the old men could not remember...

967
02:51:44,550 --> 02:51:46,509
"...such a one-sided victory.

968
02:51:46,600 --> 02:51:49,559
"And I gradually began
to look at it in a new way.

969
02:51:49,770 --> 02:51:52,309
"I felt a pride I'd never felt before.

970
02:51:53,100 --> 02:51:55,939
"I'd never really known who John Dunbar was.

971
02:51:56,270 --> 02:51:58,819
"Perhaps the name itself had no meaning.

972
02:51:58,900 --> 02:52:02,069
"But as I heard my Sioux name
being called over and over...

973
02:52:02,110 --> 02:52:04,989
"...I knew for the first time who I really was."

974
02:53:27,950 --> 02:53:31,949
When we were younger,
he always bragged about how brave he was.

975
02:53:32,040 --> 02:53:35,499
And what a great chief he would make.

976
02:53:35,580 --> 02:53:37,879
He thought I was impressed.

977
02:53:37,960 --> 02:53:42,549
While walking on the prairie,
we surprised a small herd of buffalo...

978
02:53:42,630 --> 02:53:46,219
and the first thing this brave warrior did
was run for a tree.

979
02:53:48,890 --> 02:53:50,889
He would have forgotten all about me...

980
02:53:50,930 --> 02:53:53,059
...if he hadn't needed my help to climb it.

981
02:53:53,140 --> 02:53:57,769
And we sat there all day
as this old cow circled below.

982
02:53:57,850 --> 02:54:00,729
Making loud noises
and hitting her head against the trunk.

983
02:54:11,830 --> 02:54:15,709
Where are you going?
There is gambling tonight.

984
02:54:15,750 --> 02:54:18,249
Horseback's games are always good.

985
02:54:19,580 --> 02:54:24,089
I'm tired.
Horseback already has a good rifle of mine.

986
02:54:27,590 --> 02:54:29,469
Good night.

987
02:55:12,640 --> 02:55:15,719
How long must Stands With A Fist mourn?

988
02:55:16,520 --> 02:55:18,479
I don't know.

989
02:55:22,150 --> 02:55:25,279
I hope it won't be too long.

990
02:55:27,860 --> 02:55:29,949
Has something happened?

991
02:55:30,570 --> 02:55:32,199
What?

992
02:55:33,030 --> 02:55:35,829
She has found love again.

993
02:55:36,870 --> 02:55:38,869
With who?

994
02:55:38,960 --> 02:55:40,459
Who do you think?

995
02:55:40,500 --> 02:55:41,789
Tell me.

996
02:55:41,880 --> 02:55:44,209
Dances With Wolves.

997
02:55:47,170 --> 02:55:49,129
Are you sure?

998
02:55:49,970 --> 02:55:53,719
When you see them together, you'll know.

999
02:55:55,430 --> 02:55:57,469
What are people saying?

1000
02:55:58,180 --> 02:56:00,269
They like the match.

1001
02:56:05,360 --> 02:56:07,479
No one is angry?

1002
02:56:07,570 --> 02:56:11,609
It makes sense. They're both white.

1003
02:56:13,620 --> 02:56:17,829
I suppose I'll be the one to say something.

1004
02:56:18,700 --> 02:56:21,329
She's your daughter now.

1005
02:56:21,830 --> 02:56:23,789
I know.

1006
02:56:29,260 --> 02:56:33,179
Relax. You can't see everything coming.

1007
02:56:33,890 --> 02:56:37,219
Stop it. Quit playing.

1008
02:56:50,940 --> 02:56:52,609
Stands With A Fist.

1009
02:56:53,910 --> 02:56:56,449
You must mourn no more.

1010
02:57:16,760 --> 02:57:19,349
Sit, sit.

1011
02:57:25,440 --> 02:57:28,479
There's talk that you want to get married.

1012
02:57:30,780 --> 02:57:32,149
To who?

1013
02:57:32,900 --> 02:57:34,989
To Stands With A Fist.

1014
02:57:35,070 --> 02:57:36,989
That's the one, isn't it?

1015
02:57:37,070 --> 02:57:38,279
She's in mourning.

1016
02:57:38,370 --> 02:57:39,829
Not today.

1017
02:57:39,910 --> 02:57:42,699
Kicking Bird has released her.

1018
02:57:42,790 --> 02:57:44,749
He did?

1019
02:57:45,120 --> 02:57:47,289
What are you doing here?

1020
02:57:48,590 --> 02:57:51,749
Kicking Bird told me to wait.

1021
02:57:53,510 --> 02:57:55,759
You might have to wait a long time.

1022
02:57:55,800 --> 02:57:59,929
Smiles A Lot says he saw Kicking Bird
riding on the prairie.

1023
02:58:01,390 --> 02:58:04,479
He says he was talking to himself.

1024
02:58:04,560 --> 02:58:06,099
A medicine man takes it pretty hard...

1025
02:58:06,140 --> 02:58:08,149
...when he is the last to know something.

1026
02:58:10,320 --> 02:58:12,569
What do I do?

1027
02:58:15,740 --> 02:58:19,949
You are very poor,
and a Lakota girl isn't cheap.

1028
02:58:19,990 --> 02:58:22,539
I don't know if you can get married.

1029
02:58:27,290 --> 02:58:29,289
I have the buckskin....

1030
02:58:29,330 --> 02:58:30,879
No, that's too much.

1031
02:58:33,340 --> 02:58:37,759
Do you think my horse is too much?

1032
02:58:39,680 --> 02:58:42,179
For a girl.

1033
02:58:46,600 --> 02:58:50,479
Wait here. Maybe we can help you.

1034
02:58:50,560 --> 02:58:52,229
Wait.

1035
02:58:54,440 --> 02:58:56,399
That's all I do is wait!

1036
02:59:17,220 --> 02:59:20,929
"The whole village was eager
to take up a collection on my behalf.

1037
02:59:21,050 --> 02:59:24,009
"The generosity of the people was astonishing.

1038
02:59:24,060 --> 02:59:27,429
"The more valued the gift,
the more easily it was given.

1039
02:59:27,560 --> 02:59:31,899
"Even the poorer families
wanted to give up animals they could not afford.

1040
02:59:32,020 --> 02:59:34,229
"It was hard to turn them away.

1041
02:59:38,950 --> 02:59:40,989
"Black Shawl was a mystery.

1042
02:59:41,740 --> 02:59:45,239
"I couldn't guess whatshe was thinking
and she offered no advice...

1043
02:59:45,740 --> 02:59:47,789
"...no words of encouragement.

1044
02:59:53,590 --> 02:59:55,919
"I may have been the brunt of an insidejoke...

1045
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,339
"...that included the entire village...

1046
02:59:58,460 --> 03:00:00,299
"...but I was determined.

1047
03:00:03,640 --> 03:00:07,059
"Wind In His Hair told me
if all the gifts were gone in the morning...

1048
03:00:07,100 --> 03:00:09,229
"...my offer had been accepted.

1049
03:00:10,270 --> 03:00:14,519
"I spent a sleepless night
wondering what misstep, if any, I had made.

1050
03:00:15,440 --> 03:00:18,779
"I had no idea
what Kicking Bird's decision would be."

1051
03:00:42,180 --> 03:00:43,719
Turn around.

1052
03:00:45,800 --> 03:00:48,179
You look good.

1053
03:00:48,260 --> 03:00:51,309
You know, the man she mourned for....

1054
03:00:51,390 --> 03:00:54,189
He was my best friend.

1055
03:00:55,980 --> 03:00:58,109
I didn't know that.

1056
03:01:00,610 --> 03:01:02,699
He was a good man.

1057
03:01:03,320 --> 03:01:06,489
lt has been hard for me to like you.

1058
03:01:07,950 --> 03:01:11,369
I am not the wise man Kicking Bird is.

1059
03:01:11,450 --> 03:01:13,869
I always feeI anger first.

1060
03:01:13,960 --> 03:01:16,629
There were no answers to my questions.

1061
03:01:16,670 --> 03:01:21,879
But now I think he went away
because you were coming.

1062
03:01:21,970 --> 03:01:24,259
That is how I see it.

1063
03:01:48,370 --> 03:01:50,989
This is a good day for me.

1064
03:01:52,910 --> 03:01:54,289
And for me.

1065
03:01:57,790 --> 03:02:01,499
lf you want this man, take his hand in yours.

1066
03:02:16,310 --> 03:02:18,399
"I had never been married before.

1067
03:02:18,480 --> 03:02:21,399
"I don't know if all grooms
have the same experience...

1068
03:02:21,480 --> 03:02:25,859
"...but as Kicking Bird began to speak about
what was expected of a Sioux husband...

1069
03:02:25,900 --> 03:02:29,699
"...my mind began to swim
in a way that shut out everything but her...

1070
03:02:29,740 --> 03:02:32,039
"...the tiny details of her costume...

1071
03:02:32,120 --> 03:02:34,199
"...the contours of hershape...

1072
03:02:34,450 --> 03:02:36,369
"...the light in her eyes...

1073
03:02:36,540 --> 03:02:38,579
"...the smallness of her feet.

1074
03:02:39,290 --> 03:02:42,129
"I knew that the love
between us would be served."

1075
03:02:47,970 --> 03:02:51,259
Have you heard all that I have said?

1076
03:02:53,600 --> 03:02:54,599
Yes.

1077
03:02:56,430 --> 03:03:00,149
Good, then take her inside.

1078
03:03:00,230 --> 03:03:01,939
She is your wife.

1079
03:03:04,360 --> 03:03:05,649
Good.

1080
03:03:07,150 --> 03:03:09,609
Thank you.

1081
03:03:16,250 --> 03:03:17,289
Bye.

1082
03:03:22,710 --> 03:03:23,749
Bye.

1083
03:04:07,880 --> 03:04:11,469
Dances With Wolves' door
is closed a lot these days.

1084
03:04:11,550 --> 03:04:15,509
I think they're having trouble making a baby.

1085
03:04:15,560 --> 03:04:18,889
I don't think they're having trouble at all.

1086
03:04:22,850 --> 03:04:26,319
lf we pull the smoke flap shut,
they will come out for sure.

1087
03:04:51,380 --> 03:04:55,219
Dances With Wolves, are you in there?

1088
03:04:57,890 --> 03:05:02,019
Today I am riding away to a far away place.

1089
03:05:02,100 --> 03:05:04,269
I would like you to ride with me.

1090
03:05:19,990 --> 03:05:22,209
It's good to be out.

1091
03:05:23,210 --> 03:05:25,579
Yes, it must be.

1092
03:05:26,750 --> 03:05:29,129
We are trying for a baby.

1093
03:05:30,510 --> 03:05:32,219
No waiting?

1094
03:05:32,800 --> 03:05:34,549
No waiting.

1095
03:05:38,810 --> 03:05:43,269
I was just thinking
that of all the paths in this life...

1096
03:05:44,440 --> 03:05:47,229
...there is one that matters most.

1097
03:05:47,310 --> 03:05:50,609
lt is the traiI of a true human being.

1098
03:05:51,900 --> 03:05:56,359
I think you are on this path, and it is good to see.

1099
03:06:16,300 --> 03:06:18,799
We call you the Busy Bee.

1100
03:06:54,840 --> 03:06:58,679
lt is said that all the animals were born here.

1101
03:06:58,760 --> 03:07:02,969
That from here they spread over the prairies
to feed all the people.

1102
03:07:03,600 --> 03:07:07,139
Even our enemies agree
that this is a sacred place.

1103
03:07:58,280 --> 03:08:00,029
It's quiet here.

1104
03:10:00,070 --> 03:10:02,649
We must wait for these people.

1105
03:10:03,990 --> 03:10:07,739
No, they've been gone a week. Maybe more.

1106
03:10:10,370 --> 03:10:13,659
We will water the horses and go home.

1107
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:03,799
You always ask about the white people.

1108
03:11:05,590 --> 03:11:07,759
You always want to know
how many more are coming.

1109
03:11:10,090 --> 03:11:12,759
There will be a lot, my friend.

1110
03:11:12,850 --> 03:11:14,599
More than can be counted.

1111
03:11:17,140 --> 03:11:18,389
How many?

1112
03:11:21,110 --> 03:11:22,609
Like the stars.

1113
03:11:36,960 --> 03:11:40,919
lt makes me afraid for all the Sioux.

1114
03:11:48,300 --> 03:11:51,089
We should tell this to Ten Bears.

1115
03:12:17,580 --> 03:12:19,619
The men who wore this came...

1116
03:12:19,710 --> 03:12:22,579
...in the time of my grandfather's grandfather.

1117
03:12:23,170 --> 03:12:25,879
Eventually we drove them out.

1118
03:12:26,630 --> 03:12:30,339
Then the Mexicans came.
They do not come here anymore.

1119
03:12:30,760 --> 03:12:33,799
In my own time, the Texans.

1120
03:12:33,850 --> 03:12:36,389
They have been like all the others.

1121
03:12:39,430 --> 03:12:44,149
They take without asking.

1122
03:12:45,110 --> 03:12:48,899
I don't know if we are ready for these people.

1123
03:12:50,360 --> 03:12:54,909
But I think you are right.
I think they will keep coming.

1124
03:12:56,160 --> 03:12:58,619
When I think of that, I look at this helmet.

1125
03:13:01,160 --> 03:13:05,289
Our country is all that we have,
and we will fight to keep it.

1126
03:13:06,380 --> 03:13:08,419
Tomorrow we will strike the village...

1127
03:13:08,510 --> 03:13:10,839
...and go to the winter camp.

1128
03:13:42,040 --> 03:13:44,829
You have everything from the soldier fort?

1129
03:13:45,080 --> 03:13:46,129
Yes.

1130
03:13:46,460 --> 03:13:48,589
There's nothing for me there.

1131
03:13:49,550 --> 03:13:50,959
That's good.

1132
03:14:04,560 --> 03:14:05,939
The journal.

1133
03:14:08,190 --> 03:14:09,899
Stands With.... Wait!

1134
03:14:10,280 --> 03:14:11,439
Words are important!

1135
03:14:11,530 --> 03:14:13,899
The words in the book
are like a traiI for people to follow.

1136
03:14:13,950 --> 03:14:17,739
Now, it tells everything about my life here.
I must get it.

1137
03:14:17,950 --> 03:14:19,119
Enough.

1138
03:14:19,200 --> 03:14:21,789
We cannot wait for you.

1139
03:14:33,670 --> 03:14:35,879
I'll catch up.

1140
03:15:17,510 --> 03:15:18,639
Injun!

1141
03:15:19,050 --> 03:15:20,549
Get him! Injun!

1142
03:15:26,180 --> 03:15:27,189
No!

1143
03:15:48,790 --> 03:15:50,999
Stay down. Stay.

1144
03:15:51,380 --> 03:15:52,789
My God.

1145
03:15:53,460 --> 03:15:54,709
God.

1146
03:16:00,390 --> 03:16:01,639
It's okay.

1147
03:16:43,930 --> 03:16:45,469
Something has happened.

1148
03:16:45,560 --> 03:16:48,139
Dances With Wolves is not coming.

1149
03:16:48,770 --> 03:16:50,769
He must have trouble.

1150
03:16:52,440 --> 03:16:57,779
Pick two good men
and send them back to the soldier fort.

1151
03:17:09,580 --> 03:17:10,959
Spivey.

1152
03:17:11,830 --> 03:17:14,039
-Spivey!
-Yeah, Sergeant.

1153
03:17:15,130 --> 03:17:17,339
Tell the major he's waking up.

1154
03:17:19,260 --> 03:17:21,169
Move your worthless ass.

1155
03:17:32,730 --> 03:17:34,769
You got yourself a hell of a shiner...

1156
03:17:35,560 --> 03:17:36,859
...didn't you?

1157
03:17:36,940 --> 03:17:39,029
Major's coming through.

1158
03:17:49,120 --> 03:17:50,999
Does he speak English?

1159
03:17:51,160 --> 03:17:52,789
I don't know, sir.

1160
03:17:54,580 --> 03:17:56,379
Speak English?

1161
03:17:58,170 --> 03:18:00,759
Talk English? Talk!

1162
03:18:02,510 --> 03:18:04,129
I speak English.

1163
03:18:08,680 --> 03:18:10,059
Who are you?

1164
03:18:12,230 --> 03:18:16,439
Lt. John J. Dunbar. This is my post.

1165
03:18:17,020 --> 03:18:18,729
Why are you dressed like this?

1166
03:18:20,980 --> 03:18:24,819
I came out from Fort Hayes last April,
but there was nobody here.

1167
03:18:25,410 --> 03:18:27,409
Do you have proof of that?

1168
03:18:29,950 --> 03:18:34,249
My journal's on the bunk in my quarters.
My orders are in the journal.

1169
03:18:34,330 --> 03:18:36,459
lt will tell you everything.

1170
03:18:36,750 --> 03:18:39,379
Spivey, you and Edwards
were the first ones here.

1171
03:18:39,460 --> 03:18:41,799
Did you find anything? A journal?

1172
03:18:42,130 --> 03:18:44,469
No, we didn't find nothing, sir.

1173
03:18:44,880 --> 03:18:46,469
Where's Edwards?

1174
03:18:46,970 --> 03:18:48,429
He's outside.

1175
03:18:53,060 --> 03:18:55,479
He didn't find nothing either.

1176
03:18:59,690 --> 03:19:02,029
Somebody find me Edwards.

1177
03:19:10,780 --> 03:19:12,489
You turned Injun, didn't you?

1178
03:19:17,580 --> 03:19:18,959
Didn't you?

1179
03:19:23,630 --> 03:19:25,879
What did you say your name was?

1180
03:19:26,590 --> 03:19:27,759
Dunbar.

1181
03:19:28,840 --> 03:19:31,259
D-u-n-b-a-r. John.

1182
03:19:31,350 --> 03:19:33,349
You say you're an officer?

1183
03:19:33,600 --> 03:19:37,439
-God. Did you read my orders?
-No.

1184
03:19:38,100 --> 03:19:40,189
They're in my journal.

1185
03:19:40,440 --> 03:19:42,149
There are no orders.

1186
03:19:42,610 --> 03:19:44,359
There's no journal.

1187
03:19:48,780 --> 03:19:50,819
Why are you out of uniform?

1188
03:19:53,200 --> 03:19:54,949
I have to relieve myself.

1189
03:19:58,160 --> 03:20:00,919
-Sergeant, take care of him.
-Yes, sir.

1190
03:20:02,540 --> 03:20:03,749
Let's go.

1191
03:20:07,760 --> 03:20:09,929
-He's a white man.
-Doesn't look white to me.

1192
03:20:10,720 --> 03:20:13,719
-They say he's a soldier.
-He's an officer.

1193
03:20:13,810 --> 03:20:15,639
Do you salute him or shoot him?

1194
03:20:24,650 --> 03:20:26,529
Here, you. Eyes front.

1195
03:20:32,410 --> 03:20:34,029
I said eyes front!

1196
03:20:36,080 --> 03:20:38,539
Don't shoot him! Hit him! Get him!

1197
03:20:38,620 --> 03:20:39,909
Get him!

1198
03:21:30,380 --> 03:21:32,379
Why are you out of uniform?

1199
03:21:36,390 --> 03:21:37,889
What's the army doing out here?

1200
03:21:38,930 --> 03:21:41,519
-Lieutenant's asking the questions.
-Bauer.

1201
03:21:47,770 --> 03:21:50,109
We're charged with apprehending....

1202
03:21:53,030 --> 03:21:56,489
We're charged with apprehending hostiles
and recovering stolen property...

1203
03:21:56,570 --> 03:21:59,369
...retrieving white captives
taken in hostile raidings.

1204
03:21:59,450 --> 03:22:03,409
-There are no hostiles.
-We will ascertain that for ourselves.

1205
03:22:03,500 --> 03:22:06,539
lf you'll guide us to these camps
and serve as an interpreter...

1206
03:22:06,580 --> 03:22:08,999
...your conduct will be re-evaluated.

1207
03:22:09,500 --> 03:22:11,549
-What conduct?
-With all due respect--

1208
03:22:11,590 --> 03:22:14,879
Your status as a traitor might improve
should you choose...

1209
03:22:14,970 --> 03:22:17,719
...to cooperate with the United States Army.

1210
03:22:19,510 --> 03:22:21,849
There's nothing for you to do out here.

1211
03:22:25,480 --> 03:22:27,979
Are you willing to cooperate or not?

1212
03:22:30,730 --> 03:22:32,239
Speak up!

1213
03:22:36,030 --> 03:22:39,409
I am Dances With Wolves.

1214
03:22:41,580 --> 03:22:42,449
What's that?

1215
03:22:45,290 --> 03:22:47,959
I have nothing to say to you.

1216
03:22:48,040 --> 03:22:51,249
You are not worth talking to.

1217
03:23:01,260 --> 03:23:04,929
Sergeant, form a detail
and take this man down to the river.

1218
03:23:05,810 --> 03:23:08,649
-Let him clean up his face.
-Yes, sir.

1219
03:23:10,730 --> 03:23:12,229
Not you, Spivey.

1220
03:23:40,300 --> 03:23:41,639
Lieutenant.

1221
03:23:44,220 --> 03:23:46,179
Major wants to see you.

1222
03:24:20,470 --> 03:24:21,889
Spivey.

1223
03:24:26,890 --> 03:24:28,939
Spivey. You got paper?

1224
03:24:29,560 --> 03:24:33,019
-What's it to you?
-Give me some, shit-bird.

1225
03:24:33,400 --> 03:24:34,439
Can you read?

1226
03:24:34,610 --> 03:24:36,819
No, I can't read. What the hell's the difference?

1227
03:24:36,900 --> 03:24:39,859
You can't read either. Now just give me some.

1228
03:24:40,360 --> 03:24:44,199
-Quick, give me some!
-All right. Hold your horses.

1229
03:26:06,320 --> 03:26:07,489
Bauer!

1230
03:26:11,120 --> 03:26:12,409
Let go of me!

1231
03:26:20,670 --> 03:26:23,549
Lap it up, Injun. Go ahead. Lap it up.

1232
03:26:26,300 --> 03:26:28,049
You son of a bitch!

1233
03:26:30,970 --> 03:26:32,479
It's all right.

1234
03:26:33,180 --> 03:26:34,729
It's all right.

1235
03:26:35,310 --> 03:26:39,479
He's going to get hungrier, that's all.
But maybe that don't matter.

1236
03:26:40,280 --> 03:26:43,279
Word is they're going to ship you back to Hayes.

1237
03:26:43,360 --> 03:26:46,029
And once you get there, they gonna hang you.

1238
03:26:49,700 --> 03:26:52,699
Come on. Forget about him.
Go on. Get out of here.

1239
03:27:07,800 --> 03:27:08,969
Get up in there!

1240
03:27:34,950 --> 03:27:36,959
Spivey, what is that?

1241
03:27:37,370 --> 03:27:39,539
Looks like he's following us.

1242
03:27:39,790 --> 03:27:41,539
Hell, I'm going to shoot him.

1243
03:27:42,670 --> 03:27:43,839
Dang. You missed him.

1244
03:27:44,880 --> 03:27:47,799
-Don't shoot, damn it. It's my shot.
-Wait. I seen him first.

1245
03:27:47,880 --> 03:27:49,719
-Get down!
-Look at that stupid bastard.

1246
03:27:49,800 --> 03:27:51,549
He ain't even moving.

1247
03:27:52,100 --> 03:27:55,729
-Wait a minute! That's my shot.
-Shoot him!

1248
03:27:56,810 --> 03:27:59,269
Shoot him, Edwards. He's standing there.

1249
03:27:59,730 --> 03:28:00,609
Shoot him!

1250
03:28:03,940 --> 03:28:06,029
Jesus Christ! Holy shit!

1251
03:28:10,620 --> 03:28:12,449
Bauer, get him off him!

1252
03:28:19,250 --> 03:28:20,789
He might have killed you.

1253
03:28:28,630 --> 03:28:30,129
I'll get that son of a bitch.

1254
03:28:36,720 --> 03:28:38,389
Sit down, goddamn it!

1255
03:28:50,740 --> 03:28:52,319
That's it. I got him!

1256
03:28:55,830 --> 03:28:57,949
Dead shot, boys. Come on.

1257
03:28:59,370 --> 03:29:00,919
Son of a bitch!

1258
03:29:01,500 --> 03:29:02,709
Get up!

1259
03:29:04,380 --> 03:29:05,459
Get up!

1260
03:29:07,010 --> 03:29:08,799
I mean it! Get up!

1261
03:29:08,880 --> 03:29:10,879
Get up! Come on, get up!

1262
03:29:11,430 --> 03:29:12,469
What?

1263
03:29:12,550 --> 03:29:15,809
You bash that prisoner one more time,
I'll put those shackles on you.

1264
03:29:16,850 --> 03:29:19,019
You men get back here!

1265
03:29:22,650 --> 03:29:24,019
Goddamn it!

1266
03:30:02,690 --> 03:30:03,599
Boo.

1267
03:30:12,150 --> 03:30:14,449
Clear behind that stand of trees?

1268
03:30:18,660 --> 03:30:20,409
All right. Let's go.

1269
03:30:43,940 --> 03:30:45,229
I don't see nobody.

1270
03:31:03,960 --> 03:31:05,169
Indians!

1271
03:34:47,800 --> 03:34:48,759
No.

1272
03:37:37,350 --> 03:37:42,019
Dances With Wolves is quiet these days.

1273
03:37:43,770 --> 03:37:46,269
ls his heart bad?

1274
03:37:55,370 --> 03:37:58,579
Killing the soldiers at the river...

1275
03:38:01,040 --> 03:38:03,249
...was a good thing.

1276
03:38:04,130 --> 03:38:07,049
I did not mind killing those men.
I was glad to do it.

1277
03:38:11,050 --> 03:38:16,799
But the soldiers hate me now,
like they hate no other.

1278
03:38:17,930 --> 03:38:21,229
They think I am a traitor.

1279
03:38:25,900 --> 03:38:29,319
And they will hunt for me.

1280
03:38:29,400 --> 03:38:33,609
And when they find me, they find you.

1281
03:38:35,070 --> 03:38:40,949
I think it would be wise to move the village now.

1282
03:38:47,920 --> 03:38:50,169
I will be leaving.

1283
03:38:52,590 --> 03:38:56,589
I must go and talk with those who would listen.

1284
03:39:05,440 --> 03:39:08,309
Quiet. You are hurting my ears.

1285
03:39:18,280 --> 03:39:20,949
Leave us alone.

1286
03:39:38,760 --> 03:39:42,809
You are the only white man I have ever known.

1287
03:39:42,890 --> 03:39:46,849
I have thought about you a lot.
More than you know.

1288
03:39:46,940 --> 03:39:50,729
But I think you are wrong.

1289
03:39:51,650 --> 03:39:54,739
The man the soldiers are looking for
no longer exists.

1290
03:39:54,820 --> 03:40:01,239
Now there is only a Lakota Sioux
named Dances With Wolves.

1291
03:40:05,160 --> 03:40:07,419
Let's smoke awhile.

1292
03:40:13,050 --> 03:40:15,879
"With Ten Bears,
it was always more than a while.

1293
03:40:15,970 --> 03:40:19,759
"There was purpose in everything he did
and I knew he wanted me to stay.

1294
03:40:19,840 --> 03:40:21,509
"But I was sure of myself.

1295
03:40:21,600 --> 03:40:25,769
"I would be an excuse and that's all
the army would need to find this place.

1296
03:40:25,850 --> 03:40:28,519
"I pushed him as far as I could
to move the camp...

1297
03:40:28,600 --> 03:40:31,979
"...butin the end he only smiled
and talked of simple pleasures.

1298
03:40:32,070 --> 03:40:36,319
"He reminded me that at his age
a good fire is better than anything.

1299
03:40:36,740 --> 03:40:39,159
"Ten Bears was an extraordinary man."

1300
03:41:20,490 --> 03:41:22,369
You have nothing to say?

1301
03:41:24,740 --> 03:41:26,539
What can I tell you?

1302
03:41:28,200 --> 03:41:30,169
What's ever on your mind.

1303
03:41:36,800 --> 03:41:38,799
You've made the decision.

1304
03:41:43,260 --> 03:41:45,049
My place is with you.

1305
03:41:46,010 --> 03:41:47,679
I go where you go.

1306
03:41:51,230 --> 03:41:52,899
You're not afraid?

1307
03:41:53,980 --> 03:41:55,019
No.

1308
03:41:58,480 --> 03:42:01,569
I told Ten Bears
we'd leave when the snow breaks.

1309
03:42:08,700 --> 03:42:10,579
Did you tell everyone?

1310
03:42:14,630 --> 03:42:16,089
Not everyone.

1311
03:42:52,620 --> 03:42:54,869
It's all right.

1312
03:43:27,780 --> 03:43:29,159
You...

1313
03:43:30,200 --> 03:43:31,739
...finish your pipe?

1314
03:43:44,880 --> 03:43:46,179
Good pipe.

1315
03:43:47,680 --> 03:43:49,009
How...

1316
03:43:49,550 --> 03:43:50,929
...does it smoke?

1317
03:43:54,060 --> 03:43:55,599
I've never smoked it.

1318
03:44:07,410 --> 03:44:08,779
We come far...

1319
03:44:09,200 --> 03:44:10,529
...you and me.

1320
03:44:13,240 --> 03:44:15,119
I will not forget you.

1321
03:46:03,690 --> 03:46:06,319
Dances With Wolves.

1322
03:46:07,440 --> 03:46:10,109
I am Wind In His Hair.

1323
03:46:10,200 --> 03:46:13,699
Do you see that I am your friend?

1324
03:46:17,700 --> 03:46:20,959
Can you see that you will always be my friend?

1325
03:47:48,630 --> 03:47:50,629
Sergeant! Over here! Now!

1326
03:48:37,220 --> 03:48:45,809
Thirteen years later, their homes destroyed,
their buffalo gone, the last band of free Sioux

1327
03:48:45,890 --> 03:48:53,729
submitted to white authority at Fort Robinson,
Nebraska. The great horse culture of the plains

1328
03:48:53,820 --> 03:48:58,739
was gone and the American frontier was soon
to pass into history.
