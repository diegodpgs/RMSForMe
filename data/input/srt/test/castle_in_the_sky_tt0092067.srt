1
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,150
Pirates!

2
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,820
We're under attack!

3
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,570
Hold them off!
Get down on the floor.

4
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,270
Tear gas!

5
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,160
What are you waiting for?
Break it down!

6
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,420
Where'd she go?

7
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,920
There she is!

8
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,340
She's getting away!

9
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,550
Well, get her!

10
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,850
Mama, don't drop me!

11
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,930
There's the stone.
Quick, go next door!

12
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,230
Get that crystal!

13
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,020
There goes the crystal.

14
00:03:52,620 --> 00:04:01,090
Castle in the Sky

15
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,720
Two meatballs, please.

16
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,600
Working late?

17
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,990
We're finally busy again.

18
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,750
Still working?

19
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,780
Yeah.

20
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,710
What's that?

21
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,720
A person!

22
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,690
Pazu!

23
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,860
What are you up to?
Where's my dinner?

24
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,700
Boss!

25
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,700
A girl fell from the sky.

26
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,890
Boss, she fell from the sky...

27
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,930
Darn old clunker.

28
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,980
Boss! A girl...

29
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,480
Close Valve No. 2!

30
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,350
Ouch!
Pazu, toss me a wrench.

31
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,960
I'm busy here. You take it.

32
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,530
Don't make them wait.

33
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,410
Keep a steady hand.

34
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,610
Brake!

35
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,620
Any luck?

36
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,170
No silver, no tin even.

37
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,740
All that wasted work.

38
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,170
Should we try the east vein?

39
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,970
That's riddled with old holes.

40
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,090
We'll have to start over.

41
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,390
That's enough for today.

42
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,030
Shut down the boiler.
Call it a day.

43
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,280
I'll go under at this rate.

44
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,610
Oil the clunker, Pazu.

45
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,470
Mama, we couldn't find her.
lt's too dark.

46
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,390
I hope you really looked!

47
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,270
All right. We'll wait for daylight.

48
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:15,480
Hi. How are you feeling?
Hey, come on guys...

49
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,530
I'm Pazu. I live here by myself.

50
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,860
They eat after I play.

51
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,210
So you are human after all.

52
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,210
I was afraid you were an angel.

53
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,720
Thanks for helping me.
I'm Sheeta.

54
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,470
Sheeta, nice name. You fell
from the sky. A bit scary.

55
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,880
That's right. Why am I still alive?

56
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,610
I fell from the airship...

57
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,190
Don't you remember?

58
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,110
No.

59
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,410
Say, can I see that?

60
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,560
This?

61
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,920
It's been in my family forever.

62
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,740
It's beautiful.
Here...

63
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,640
Watch this!

64
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:41,600
Pazu!

65
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,750
So it wasn't the stone after all.

66
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,610
Oh, no! Pazu!

67
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,280
Are you OK?

68
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,610
Yeah. Are you?

69
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,820
I'm fine. Sorry, did it hurt?

70
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,240
No, my head's harder
than my boss's fists.

71
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,650
The pot's still boiling.

72
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,460
Hungry? Let's eat.

73
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,670
Wash up over there.

74
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,330
There's a towel.

75
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,590
Thank you.

76
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,700
Laputa...

77
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,450
Sheeta!
Where are you?

78
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,380
My father took that picture.

79
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,380
That's Laputa,
an island in the sky.

80
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,590
An island in the sky...?

81
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,640
They say it's only a myth.

82
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,560
But my father saw it.

83
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,850
He took it from an airship.

84
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:26,710
There's a Laputa in Gulliver's
Travels, but Swift made it up.

85
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,520
Dad drew this.

86
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,320
He said the abandoned palace
was full of treasure.

87
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,610
But nobody believed him.

88
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,700
Until he died, they called him a liar.

89
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,290
But my father never lied.

90
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,800
I'm building a real plane.
I'm going to find Laputa!

91
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,810
A real automobile... they're rare.

92
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,810
They're pirates!

93
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,650
They attacked the airship.

94
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,530
- Are they after you?
- Yes.

95
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,650
Quick!

96
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,120
Morning!

97
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,580
Hey, wait!

98
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,920
What? We're in a rush.

99
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,380
Have you seen a girl?

100
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,380
Sure, yesterday...
The boss's kid, Madge...

101
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,630
Off you go!

102
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,890
They're indeed looking for you.

103
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,850
Louis, a girl's dress!

104
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,770
What! She was disguised!
Tell Mama!

105
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,440
Haven't seen her.

106
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,710
A cute little girl.
Brown hair, braids...

107
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,120
Boss!

108
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,990
Boss!

109
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,580
About that age.

110
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,420
That's her!

111
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,840
Pirates! They're chasing her.

112
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,680
Pirates! Lemme see!

113
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,270
Not one step closer.

114
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,560
- Hand her over.
- Pirates, eh?

115
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,730
Dola's clan.

116
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,730
Go home. Just poor folk here.

117
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,610
Ma'am?

118
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:41,880
Scoot out the back.

119
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,450
I want to fight.

120
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,160
They've got weapons!

121
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,740
But...!

122
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,910
What a pretty girl.
Better protect her.

123
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,380
You refuse to step aside?

124
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,380
Use your fists. Like a man.

125
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,000
Could be interesting.

126
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,800
Get him, brother.

127
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,230
Show your stuff.

128
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,990
Wow.

129
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,830
Who's going to mend that shirt?

130
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,890
You can beat him!

131
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,770
That's it, hit him!

132
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,090
Think you can fool me?
After them!

133
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:28,930
Yes!

134
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,190
Climb on!

135
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,690
There you go.

136
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,770
Playing hooky for a date?

137
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,320
Bad guys are after us.

138
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,870
The Dola clan.

139
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,450
Pirates?

140
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,540
Take us to the next town.
To the police!

141
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,600
You're on. Stoke the fire.

142
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,520
Right!

143
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,720
Mama!

144
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,060
You idiots! Hurry up and get on!

145
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,560
What? But the girl's...

146
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,440
Get moving!

147
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,860
Brother!

148
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,860
Wait!

149
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,680
They're catching up, more steam!

150
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,430
Can't you go any faster?

151
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,720
She's an old-timer.

152
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,520
Move over!

153
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,660
Mama, I can't hang on!

154
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,130
More steam, they're gaining on us!

155
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,290
Here we go!

156
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,260
Sheeta, over here.

157
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,600
Stoke the fire.

158
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,780
Don't give up!

159
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:02,080
Push! Push, I tell you!

160
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,160
Not so fast!

161
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,170
Don't let them escape!
Dump this over the side!

162
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,340
That'll teach them!

163
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,070
I'll do it.

164
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,440
No, let me.

165
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,850
Wait!

166
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,420
It's them. What'll we do?

167
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,880
I refuse to give up. Move!

168
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,150
This is a surprise. If it isn't the army.

169
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:17,240
These kids need help!
They've got pirates after them.

170
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,210
Sheeta?

171
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,070
Goodbye.

172
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,550
Wait!

173
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,800
Sheeta!

174
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,010
Halt or l'll shoot.

175
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,140
An armored train.

176
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,810
Who cares! Ram it!

177
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,270
What is it, Sheeta!

178
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,030
Stay away!

179
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,530
They're gonna fall!

180
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:39,110
Quiet. Watch closely.

181
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,310
We're floating!

182
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,730
Look! It's that crystal!

183
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,700
It was the stone after all!
Amazing!

184
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,260
We'll float all the way down.

185
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,810
Amazing! I want it!

186
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,310
Fire!

187
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,820
I have to get that amazing stone!

188
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,130
It's fading...

189
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,510
Hey, wait!

190
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,810
It's just like when you landed.

191
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,190
The opening looks so tiny.

192
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,740
I hope the Boss and the engineer
aren't in any trouble.

193
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,910
Aw, don't worry.
Miners aren't exactly wimps.

194
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,450
Come on, let's find the way out.

195
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:57,330
These mines are ancient.
Tunnels everywhere.

196
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,600
There.

197
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:15,600
I'm so happy. I was starving.

198
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,770
I've still got an apple and some candy.

199
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,860
It's like you have a magical bag
that holds everything.

200
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,920
Gondoa? That's so far north.

201
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:46,340
Yes. Both my parents died,
but they left me the house and the fields,

202
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,430
so I was getting by alone.

203
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,040
The guys with dark glasses
kidnapped you?

204
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,980
Yes.

205
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,000
That guy was one of them?

206
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,130
Who can they be,
calling in the army?

207
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,210
Dola and the other guys,
they all want the stone.

208
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:28,840
But I had no idea it
had mysterious powers.

209
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:35,890
It was always in our family.
Mother left it to me when she died.

210
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:39,480
She warned me never to show it
or give it to anyone.

211
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,780
We're both orphans, aren't we?

212
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,360
I'm sorry I dragged
you into all of this.

213
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,200
When you fell from the sky
my heart was racing.

214
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,730
I knew something
wonderful had begun.

215
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,800
Little demons... little demons.

216
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,890
Uncle Pom! It's OK. He's really great.

217
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,060
Uncle Pom.

218
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,250
We've lost our way.

219
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,860
Now that little demon
sure looks like Pazu...

220
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:27,320
With a little girl demon beside him.

221
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,570
Pirates are after us.

222
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,930
And the army.

223
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,580
How very extraordinary.

224
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,170
Drink up.

225
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,470
Thank you.

226
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:54,010
Have you always lived underground?

227
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:01,040
Why no, no. The rocks have
been stirring...

228
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,110
That's when I like to be down here.

229
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,560
The rocks were stirring...?

230
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,910
Rocks speak very softly.

231
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,030
Wonderful...

232
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,530
Pazu, look at that!

233
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,030
They were ordinary rocks until...

234
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,170
How pretty...

235
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:16,200
Here, let me show you.

236
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,980
It's gone.

237
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,860
These rocks contain Volucite.

238
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,150
Volucite?

239
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,660
As soon as it's exposed to the air,
it becomes ordinary stone.

240
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,210
It's glowing...

241
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,960
Oh, my gracious!
That's a Volucite crystal, my dear.

242
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:56,760
I've never seen one before.

243
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,930
That's why the rocks were stirring.

244
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:04,560
This stone has mysterious powers.

245
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:11,270
I thought only Laputans knew
how to make Volucite crystals.

246
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,360
Laputans...?

247
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:17,330
They used Volucite to send
a magnificent island aloft...

248
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:21,580
Laputa did exist, Sheeta!
It really did!

249
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,080
Does the island still exist?

250
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,080
Uncle Pom?

251
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:33,590
Dear, would you mind covering the
stone? Its power overwhelms me.

252
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,790
What's wrong?

253
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,400
My grandfather told me...

254
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:56,610
that the rocks stir when
Laputa floats overhead.

255
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:00,320
If you went up to the sky then,
you'd find Laputa!

256
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,030
Sheeta, my father was telling the truth!

257
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,370
Young lady...

258
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,450
Well...

259
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,470
Yes?

260
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,030
Your stone is most powerful...

261
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:19,120
I know it as one who has
spoken to rocks all my life.

262
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:25,890
A stone so powerful brings happiness,
but it also often brings misery.

263
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:31,510
What's more,
your stone is the work of men.

264
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:34,060
How on earth did you...?

265
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,820
The stone's not dangerous!

266
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:40,070
It already saved Sheeta twice!

267
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:44,070
Amazing! Laputa really does exist!

268
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,210
It's gone.

269
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,340
Let's go back to the ship.

270
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:00,550
When it's this quiet,
it's best to stay put.

271
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,840
I'm hungry...

272
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,640
It's all clear. Let's go.

273
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,850
Thank you, Uncle.

274
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,940
Look after yourselves.

275
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,920
Look at those clouds!

276
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:53,980
Beyond those clouds is an island
we've only dreamed of.

277
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,360
Here I come! I know
I'm going to find Laputa!

278
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,400
Pazu...

279
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,400
I haven't told you everything.

280
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:09,660
My family had a mysterious,
ancient name...

281
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,040
that came with this stone.

282
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:17,790
My name is Lucita,
Lucita Toelle Ur....

283
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,610
Laputa.

284
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:20,590
Laputa?

285
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,840
So you mean...

286
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,120
It's the army! Run!

287
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,520
Underground!

288
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,230
Don't move!

289
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,800
How dare you!

290
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,940
Pazu!
Let me go!

291
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,570
Pazu! Pazu!

292
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,290
We've apprehended them.

293
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,370
Good work.

294
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,160
Open up, open up!

295
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,620
Sheeta...

296
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,700
Company, march!

297
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,160
Use force!

298
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:19,220
Squeeze the brat, she'll talk.

299
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,170
Spoken like a man in uniform.

300
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,920
In your haste,
you risk everything.

301
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:30,680
If we'd mobilized sooner,
we'd have bagged Dola too.

302
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,470
She managed to decipher
your third-rate code.

303
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,720
What!

304
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,270
My organization will handle this.

305
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,730
Concentrate on mobilizing
the troops when the time is ripe.

306
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:49,030
Muska! Remember, I command
the search for Laputa!

307
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,700
Of course. But I have my
orders from the government.

308
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:00,460
That pencil-pushing upstart!

309
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:19,060
Have a nice rest?

310
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,100
Where's Pazu? Let me see him!

311
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,900
No interest in pretty clothes?

312
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:29,470
Don't fret about Pazu. His
stubborn head is harder than mine.

313
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,650
Come, I have something
to show you.

314
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:48,630
Enter.

315
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,180
What is it?

316
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,900
A mechanical soldier with vast
destructive power.

317
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,780
Until he fell from the sky,
no one believed Laputa was real.

318
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:37,720
He's not of this earth.

319
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,850
Our science can't even identify...

320
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:43,810
what material he's made of.

321
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,650
Look...
Don't be afraid.

322
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,900
He's long dead.

323
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,610
Look at that.

324
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,250
This insignia was carved on
your fireplace.

325
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,170
It's on this stone, too.

326
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,710
The stone works
only in your hands.

327
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:22,180
It protects its owner and
will guide her back to Laputa.

328
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,180
I know nothing of this!

329
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,980
Take it if you like.
Just leave us alone...

330
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:38,740
Perhaps you imagine that Laputa
is some Treasure Island.

331
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:43,080
Fearsome scientific power
thrust Laputa into orbit.

332
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:47,210
Their dreaded empire
once ruled the earth!

333
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:51,960
Even you can appreciate
that when such an entity...

334
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,760
roams the skies,
it threatens peace.

335
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,760
I need your cooperation.

336
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:04,180
You must know how to make
the stone guide us to Laputa.

337
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:08,640
I really don't know!
Please let me see Pazu!

338
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:15,650
I intend no harm,
but his fate rests with you.

339
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:23,950
The boy goes free
if you assist us, Lucita...

340
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,660
Toelle Ur Laputa.

341
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,210
But how...?

342
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:33,210
Ur means ruler.
Toelle means True.

343
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:37,210
You are Queen Lucita,
rightful heir to the Laputan throne.

344
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,400
Out!

345
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,410
Sheeta!

346
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,320
Pazu, are you hurt?

347
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,370
I'm fine. You? Did they
do anything horrible?

348
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:10,710
My dear Pazu, we misjudged you.
Accept our apologies.

349
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,710
We didn't know how gallantly...

350
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,840
you protected her from the pirates.

351
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,210
Sheeta, what did you...

352
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,180
Pazu, I beg you,
forget about Laputa.

353
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:24,010
What!

354
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:30,140
Sheeta will aid us in our
search for Laputa.

355
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,550
I understand how you feel,
but forget about her.

356
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,860
Is this true, Sheeta? But we...

357
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:38,150
Thank you for everything.

358
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,280
I'll never forget you, Pazu.

359
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,280
I don't believe it...

360
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:44,860
Sheeta, we promised!

361
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:45,620
Farewell!

362
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:46,890
Sheeta!

363
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:48,700
Wait, Sheeta!

364
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,000
Be reasonable. Act like a man.

365
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,710
Sheeta!

366
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:06,300
Here's a token of our gratitude.
It's yours.

367
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:48,050
Only you can recall the words
that will waken this stone.

368
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:51,680
If you keep your promise,
you, too, shall be free.

369
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,630
Pazu...

370
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:22,710
Mama, it's Pazu! He's back!

371
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,760
Pazu.

372
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:29,970
We were so worried.
You just disappeared.

373
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,140
And the girl?

374
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,600
Forget it.

375
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:37,690
Pazu!

376
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,060
Let me go!
What are you doing!

377
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,560
Put a lid on it!

378
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,320
Nice place you got, kid.

379
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,380
Get out!

380
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,860
This is my house!

381
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:27,150
Oh, come off it.

382
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:29,490
Can't even protect a little girl...

383
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:30,570
What?

384
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:32,160
He's got gold!

385
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:35,450
Sold her for money, huh?

386
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:37,500
No! I wouldn't do that!

387
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,330
You let them pay you off?

388
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,170
Sheeta told me to do it.

389
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:45,210
So...

390
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,300
So you gave in and crawled home.

391
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,550
You call yourself a man?

392
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:56,560
You talk big,
but you're after Sheeta too.

393
00:47:56,850 --> 00:48:01,560
But of course, we're pirates.
Pirates hunt for treasure.

394
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:06,770
Those guys are strange ones.
What's the girl to them?

395
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:14,570
You think she'll get out alive?

396
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,040
So, Sheeta told you to leave?

397
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:25,590
They threatened her,
so she tried to save you.

398
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:28,050
How do you know, Mama?

399
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:30,840
I've been a woman for 50 years.

400
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,930
She steels her heart
to save her man. How touching.

401
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:37,600
Reminds me of my youth.

402
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:41,560
You boys want to marry,
look for one like her.

403
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,610
- So that girl will grow up...
- To be like Mama?

404
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,070
What a waste.

405
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:59,160
I've got all your codes.

406
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:02,460
Calling the battle cruiser...?

407
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:15,510
They'll pack her up and take off?
We better hurry!

408
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:17,970
Dinner's over. Move out.

409
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:19,680
Yes, Mama.

410
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,600
Going after Sheeta?

411
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,100
We want the crystal, not the girl.

412
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:29,770
The stone's no good
without her.

413
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,780
Can't I go with you?

414
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,780
I have to help Sheeta!

415
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:38,780
Do it on your own, like a man.

416
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:43,290
You're right, if I was clever
and strong, I could've defended her.

417
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:45,460
Please, I don't care about treasure.

418
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,400
Listen to him...

419
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,620
Shut up!

420
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:49,750
Right...

421
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:59,600
He could probably
help us with her...

422
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:03,370
You'll be an outcast forever.

423
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,100
I know.

424
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,600
You sure?

425
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,230
Yup!

426
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:10,230
Be ready in 40 seconds.

427
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:20,830
Take care, you guys.

428
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,420
Tie this to your belt.
You boys wait on the ship.

429
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:08,870
A magnificent vessel.
Has the girl talked?

430
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,330
I need a little more time.

431
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:14,340
Forget it! We'll squeeze
it out of her up there.

432
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,550
We depart at dawn, with the girl.

433
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:40,070
Step on it, it's almost dawn!

434
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:47,080
Sheeta!

435
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,840
Whatever shall we do?

436
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:20,980
Sheeta, listen, I'm going
to teach you...

437
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:23,490
a magic spell for trouble.

438
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:24,570
A magic spell?

439
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:28,040
Yes. These are old, old, old,
secret words.

440
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:42,760
They mean
"help me rekindle the light."

441
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,240
Perfect.

442
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:32,430
Just as the ancient books described.
This is the sacred light.

443
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:33,560
Sacred light...?

444
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,610
What are the magic words?
Tell me.

445
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,840
It's moving!

446
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:12,560
The robot, it's alive!

447
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:14,460
Hello!

448
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:29,490
Help!

449
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:37,330
It's alive!
It's the robot!

450
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:45,990
The robot?

451
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,810
It's coming this way.

452
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,150
Hurry!

453
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:15,490
Retreat! Retreat!

454
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:18,790
Incredible!

455
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,420
I see!

456
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:31,430
It's the light!

457
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,930
The sacred light broke his seal!

458
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,020
The way to Laputa is open! Come!

459
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:38,930
No!

460
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:01,000
It can fly!

461
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:55,220
It's pointing to the sky...

462
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:02,640
It's showing the way to Laputa.

463
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,150
Hurry!

464
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:08,770
Explosives?
Idiot! You'll blow up the fortress!

465
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,030
Hello, hello! What is this!

466
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:14,740
Good.

467
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:16,030
We're connected.

468
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,290
This is Colonel Muska.
The robot cut communication with the ship.

469
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:23,790
I've assumed emergency command.

470
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,750
It's after the girl on the tower.

471
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:28,840
Take it down on sight.

472
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:32,330
Prepare to fire.
Just don't hit the girl.

473
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:39,720
Hurry!
Hurry up!

474
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:01,620
Fire!

475
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:20,800
Hurry!

476
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:25,880
We did it.
Awesome!

477
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,230
Get the girl.

478
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,770
Is she dead?

479
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:34,030
Get up!

480
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,050
She just fainted.

481
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:39,360
Stand!

482
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:41,910
It moved...

483
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:33,520
What's that? Looks like a war.

484
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,640
Let's go, granny!

485
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,710
That's Captain, to you!

486
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,390
Lower, Charles.

487
01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:05,410
Stop! Stop it!

488
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:06,910
Please!

489
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:18,460
Mama, Goliath's pushing off!

490
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:28,970
We're going directly into
the crossfire. Regroup!

491
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:30,600
Look, there's Sheeta!

492
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,060
What?

493
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:34,350
Where?

494
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:38,110
Straight ahead, she's
on top of that tower!

495
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:49,870
This is a job for a woman!
Cover me.

496
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:03,430
Sheeta!

497
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,260
I'm coming, Sheeta!

498
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:08,970
Pazu!

499
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,810
Fly closer!

500
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:17,810
Pazu!

501
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,860
Let me go!

502
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:42,570
Sheeta!

503
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,550
Granny!

504
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:53,080
Pazu!

505
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:04,740
Pazu!

506
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,340
Pull up!

507
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,600
Last chance! Grab her on the fly!

508
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:38,520
Pazu!

509
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,060
Here goes!

510
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:43,800
Move aside!

511
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:44,610
Damn!

512
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:45,690
Sheeta!

513
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:54,120
What's Goliath doing?

514
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,540
A smoke screen...?

515
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:17,770
Where's the robot?

516
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:19,960
Destroyed. The girl went that way.

517
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:20,810
What!

518
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:29,950
Put out the fire!
Organize a search party!

519
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,670
We haven't lost the sacred stone.

520
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,720
Its light points to Laputa...

521
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:56,470
Inform the General, we'll depart
for Laputa as planned.

522
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:35,760
He's lucky...

523
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:40,270
I can't believe she'll
grow up to be just like Mama...

524
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:48,780
There's your valley...
Right back where we started.

525
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:53,150
Granny, please take us aboard.

526
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:58,370
Call me Captain! What use
are you without the crystal?

527
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:00,160
We'll work.

528
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:03,330
I want to see Laputa
for myself.

529
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:14,340
Don't want any treasure, just
want to see Laputa?

530
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:17,100
Suspect motives
for boarding a pirate ship.

531
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:19,640
Are they coming with us, Mama?

532
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:22,460
One false move and
you're shark bait!

533
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:26,650
Excellent! No more laundry
or cleaning duty!

534
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:28,300
Or dish washing!

535
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,230
Or potato peeling!

536
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:37,490
Can you make pudding?

537
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:38,450
Yes...

538
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:40,540
I like mincemeat pie.

539
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:44,540
I eat, uhm... anything!

540
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,460
Enough out of you!

541
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:49,290
When will those boys ever grow up?

542
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:37,200
Get off!

543
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,350
Cloth. It's made of cloth.

544
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:45,020
And don't tear it.

545
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:48,650
Hurry up, it's crowded in here!

546
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:56,530
Hurry, this way!

547
01:06:57,510 --> 01:06:59,030
I hate dawdlers.

548
01:06:59,730 --> 01:07:01,160
You're with me!

549
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,370
Pazu!

550
01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:04,040
I don't bite. Come.

551
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,500
You're not here for fun.

552
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,880
What an engine.

553
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:18,300
Now where'd he go?
Pops! Pops!

554
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:22,470
Look, we got you an assistant.

555
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:27,270
Don't holler. I hear you.

556
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:33,060
He's tougher than Mama. Be careful.

557
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:40,600
My hand doesn't fit.

558
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:43,740
This gasket?

559
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:44,660
Name?

560
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:45,410
Pazu.

561
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:51,830
The crystal pointed
nearly due east...

562
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:53,630
You sure about that?

563
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:59,220
I could see the sunrise from the tower.
It's the harvest season now...

564
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:03,390
so the sun rises just south
of due east.

565
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:06,510
The light pointed to the left
of where the sun rose.

566
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:08,980
Good answer.
Any luck?

567
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,640
Not a peep.

568
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,440
Maintaining radio silence, are they?

569
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:17,610
Mama, Goliath's faster.
What do we do?

570
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:23,980
We're upwind of them. If we get
a lift on the trade winds...

571
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:26,620
My Far East-style calculator.

572
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:29,290
Windspeed is 10... and...

573
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,620
I think we can catch them.

574
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:35,920
OK, listen up!

575
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:41,930
<i>Goliath's on its way to Laputa.</i>
<i>We're on their tail.</i>

576
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:45,140
<i>With these winds,</i>
<i>I expect contact tomorrow.</i>

577
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:49,310
<i>Ten gold pieces</i>
<i>to whoever spots her first!</i>

578
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:50,140
Ten!

579
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:55,980
<i>Whatever we find, I'm sure Laputa has</i>
<i>riches enough for any pirate gang!</i>

580
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,980
Earn your keep, boys!

581
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,410
Now!

582
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:18,590
Course 98, speed 40.

583
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:52,160
That get-up of yours won't work.

584
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:54,160
Wear these.

585
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:07,050
Your station.

586
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:11,810
Beautiful...

587
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:22,780
You serve five meals a day.
Go easy on the water.

588
01:10:30,270 --> 01:10:33,200
Get to work, you idiots!

589
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:25,820
Yes?

590
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:33,510
I'm sorry, dinner isn't ready yet.

591
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:36,560
I've never cooked on an airship...

592
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,560
Do you need something?

593
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:42,400
Beautiful...

594
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:48,240
I thought I'd give you
a hand in my spare time.

595
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:52,320
Why thank you. Can you
put those dishes away?

596
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,080
Happy to obli...

597
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:00,330
You said your stomach hurt...

598
01:12:00,330 --> 01:12:02,690
I've got some free time. Can I...

599
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:05,840
You're in the way.

600
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:08,490
Some stomach ache, jerk!

601
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,380
Hey, can I help...

602
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:26,890
You've changed, chasing the likes
of Goliath... But it's pointless.

603
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:29,820
It's Laputan treasure I'm after.

604
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,570
They're certainly nice kids...

605
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:35,870
Get to the point, you old goat.

606
01:12:35,870 --> 01:12:40,410
They're too upright and honest
to ever respect you.

607
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:41,540
What's that!

608
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:44,630
No, I mean... Check...

609
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:48,380
Excellent... delicious...

610
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:54,390
Seconds anyone?

611
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:54,890
Yes?

612
01:12:54,890 --> 01:12:56,720
Seconds! Seconds!
Seconds!

613
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:17,160
Hey, shake a leg.

614
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,610
It's your watch.

615
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:23,960
Take it, it's cold.

616
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:24,960
Watch?

617
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:25,710
Yeah.

618
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:33,800
Darn cold!
Go on up.

619
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:42,510
My turn.

620
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:44,230
Great.

621
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:58,320
Sheeta!

622
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:04,820
That was scary!

623
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:07,880
It's beautiful.

624
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:21,220
Sheeta.
Get in.

625
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:26,730
<i>Can't you sleep?</i>

626
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:29,840
<i>Nice and warm...</i>

627
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,440
<i>Look aft.</i>

628
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:36,490
Pazu?

629
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:40,780
I'm really scared.

630
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:44,700
<i>I really don't want to go to Laputa.</i>

631
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:47,960
<i>I hope we never find Goliath.</i>

632
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:48,830
<i>You mean...?</i>

633
01:14:48,830 --> 01:14:53,670
<i>No, the light</i>
<i>showed the right way. But...</i>

634
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,380
<i>You mean the robot?</i>

635
01:14:58,370 --> 01:14:59,840
<i>Poor thing.</i>

636
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:05,930
<i>I never dreamed that</i>
<i>little spell would work.</i>

637
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:10,730
<i>I learned lots of other spells.</i>

638
01:15:10,730 --> 01:15:15,900
<i>To help find things, cure the sick.</i>
<i>And one I must never, ever use.</i>

639
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:17,570
<i>Never, ever use...?</i>

640
01:15:17,570 --> 01:15:19,410
<i>A spell of destruction.</i>

641
01:15:19,410 --> 01:15:25,830
<i>I had to learn bad ones so the</i>
<i>good spells had power.</i>

642
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,830
I was so scared, I couldn't sleep.

643
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:32,840
That stone should be locked away.

644
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:38,340
They hid it in the fireplace.
It was only worn for weddings.

645
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:43,760
<i>My mother's and grandmother's and</i>
<i>great grandmother's.</i>

646
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:47,180
I should have thrown it away.

647
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:51,520
You're wrong. We met
because of the stone.

648
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:55,440
Throwing it away
won't make Laputa disappear.

649
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:59,780
Airships are improving.
Someone will find it.

650
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:05,790
<i>I don't know what to do, but if</i>
<i>Laputa is so dangerous...</i>

651
01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:08,790
<i>it's not</i>
<i>for the likes of Muska.</i>

652
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:10,080
Besides...

653
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:14,380
If we run now,
they'll hunt us forever.

654
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:17,050
But don't become a pirate for me.

655
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:19,760
I won't become a pirate.

656
01:16:20,290 --> 01:16:24,260
<i>Dola understands.</i>
<i>She's nicer than she looks.</i>

657
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:28,270
Once things are settled,
I'll take you to Gondoa.

658
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:33,270
I want to see where you were
born, the valley, the yaks...

659
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:35,770
<i>Pazu...</i>

660
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:38,780
<i>What's that!</i>

661
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:41,070
Below us, look!

662
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:50,870
Goliath, right below us!

663
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,880
Come about! Full rudder!

664
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:31,700
We should go after them.
They'll be trouble if we don't!

665
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:33,870
We can't catch them in these clouds.

666
01:17:34,530 --> 01:17:37,420
We'll get them. They won't go far.

667
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:40,420
Steady as she goes.

668
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,330
We're farther north than I thought.

669
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:57,360
Pazu, listen up!
Time's running out.

670
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:01,320
<i>If we lose Goliath,</i>
<i>it's all over. Your eyes are sharp.</i>

671
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,690
<i>Track them from the crow's nest.</i>

672
01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:04,700
What do I do?

673
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:08,200
That lookout post is a glider.
See the crank?

674
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:09,410
Yeah.

675
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:10,910
<i>Turn it clockwise.</i>

676
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:18,210
Once it's locked, the upper
lever unfolds the wings.

677
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:26,470
<i>Use the wire to stabilize them.</i>
<i>Figure out how to steer as you go!</i>

678
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:29,100
- Sheeta, you there?
- Yes.

679
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:30,930
Get back down here.

680
01:18:30,930 --> 01:18:32,220
<i>Why?</i>

681
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:34,230
Because you're a girl!

682
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:39,250
But so are you! Besides, I'm
a mountain girl with sharp eyes.

683
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:40,320
Sheeta!

684
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,480
Please. Pazu agrees.

685
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:50,070
Once you're aloft, the voice tube
won't work. See the head set?

686
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:53,490
<i>You mean this, right?</i>

687
01:18:53,490 --> 01:18:54,790
Wow...

688
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:57,790
OK. I'll give it a try. Release us.

689
01:18:58,110 --> 01:18:59,580
<i>Here goes.</i>

690
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:20,730
They're gone.

691
01:19:20,730 --> 01:19:22,310
Slipped into the clouds.

692
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,320
<i>Look sharp! They could be anywhere.</i>

693
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:26,900
Aye!

694
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,070
Hold on tight.

695
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:38,710
<i>What's wrong!</i>

696
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:40,880
We're fine!

697
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:43,380
Just ran into a gust of wind.

698
01:19:44,490 --> 01:19:46,340
We're keeping watch.

699
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:47,920
Scared?

700
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,090
No.

701
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:52,890
I'm getting the hang of it.
Rough skies ahead.

702
01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:59,020
Sheeta, get the rope from my bag.

703
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,730
Tie yourself to me.

704
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:09,270
The mercury's dropping, Mama...

705
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:13,280
Lousy luck. Storm coming up...
How long 'til dawn?

706
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,660
One more hour.

707
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,430
It's dawn.

708
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:36,350
Strange that the sun's
rising on that side...

709
01:20:36,350 --> 01:20:40,310
I know! We're supposed to
be heading east. Bridge!

710
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:42,900
What! We're heading north?

711
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,940
The compass is pointing east.

712
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:48,570
The shifting winds must have
put us off course.

713
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:49,610
<i>Look!</i>

714
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:51,820
What is it? Goliath?

715
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:54,530
<i>It's a cloud. A huge one...</i>

716
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:56,330
A cloud?

717
01:20:56,730 --> 01:20:58,450
It's headed for us!

718
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:13,550
A castle in the sky...

719
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:16,960
We're headed into
a low pressure system.

720
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,560
Turn her away, full speed!

721
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:39,830
It's sucking us in.

722
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:41,620
<i>Hold tight, we can't help!</i>

723
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:50,540
The helm won't move!

724
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:53,110
Where's your brute strength?

725
01:21:53,110 --> 01:21:53,760
<i>Hey!</i>

726
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:55,760
Engine's burning up!

727
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:59,470
Stop whining and figure something out!

728
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:02,020
We're clearing the clouds!

729
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,360
Sheeta, the ocean!

730
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:24,540
The Dragon's Lair!

731
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:27,040
So this is the Dragon's Lair...

732
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:41,060
Just as Dad said.
The wind's blowing the other way.

733
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:47,980
Look out, a wall of wind!

734
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:50,400
Mama! It's sucking us in!

735
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,900
Don't give up! Be a man!

736
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:55,280
<i>Bridge! It's Laputa!</i>

737
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,570
What was that!

738
01:22:56,850 --> 01:23:00,070
Dad saw Laputa inside
the Dragon's Lair.

739
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:03,490
Don't be ridiculous! It'll tear
you to pieces!

740
01:23:03,490 --> 01:23:04,580
Pazu!

741
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:05,830
Look.

742
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:10,960
Just what we need.

743
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:26,980
Let's go for it! Dad did it.
He made it back.

744
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:29,270
All right, into the Dragon's Lair!

745
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:44,450
Got 'em!

746
01:23:44,850 --> 01:23:47,200
Our ship's in danger.
We must withdraw.

747
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:48,400
Stay on course.

748
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,900
The light's pointing
right into the cloud.

749
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:56,840
Laputa's in there.

750
01:23:56,840 --> 01:24:00,220
Stay on course.
We'll find a way in.

751
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:14,020
Here we go, Sheeta!

752
01:27:12,870 --> 01:27:16,370
Sheeta, Sheeta!
Are you all right?

753
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:23,210
Look...

754
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:38,730
Laputa...?

755
01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:42,110
Oops.

756
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:46,320
Wait... I tied it really tight.

757
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,410
My hands are shaking...

758
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:11,840
We did it!

759
01:28:31,310 --> 01:28:32,570
Birds...

760
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:35,700
Where is everyone?

761
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:48,090
Coming to greet you?

762
01:28:48,090 --> 01:28:50,510
But I don't have the stone.

763
01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:52,050
I'll cut the rope.

764
01:29:11,890 --> 01:29:13,080
What are you doing!

765
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:14,350
Wait.

766
01:29:14,350 --> 01:29:18,290
Please don't break that.
We need it to get home.

767
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:36,550
A flycatcher's nest!

768
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:38,100
That's why he's here?

769
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:46,860
See? All your eggs are fine.

770
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:48,230
The birds aren't afraid.

771
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,200
It says to follow.

772
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,330
- You understand it?
- Just intuition.

773
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:25,480
It's a city...

774
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:55,720
What an amazing place...

775
01:30:59,330 --> 01:31:01,300
You can see the sky!{}

776
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:16,150
If their science
was so advanced, what happened?

777
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:17,710
It's a grave.
I wish I could read the writing.

778
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:21,720
Someone left flowers.

779
01:32:25,710 --> 01:32:27,930
Do you put these here?

780
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:30,210
Pazu!

781
01:32:30,210 --> 01:32:31,440
It's a different robot!

782
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:39,360
It must've broken down long ago...

783
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:54,380
Probably a gardener robot.

784
01:32:55,450 --> 01:32:59,420
It protected this place
even after the people went away.

785
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,900
You picked flowers for the grave?

786
01:33:19,930 --> 01:33:20,780
Thank you.

787
01:33:22,970 --> 01:33:27,700
Are you all alone? Are there
any other robots here?

788
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:56,020
He doesn't seem to be lonely.

789
01:33:56,300 --> 01:34:00,650
He's got friends and
birds' nests to look after...

790
01:34:17,030 --> 01:34:18,210
This way!

791
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:31,640
This section's been destroyed.

792
01:34:51,350 --> 01:34:53,120
They got the Tiger Moth.

793
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,250
I hope the pirates are OK.

794
01:34:57,070 --> 01:34:59,070
Sheeta, look there!

795
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:01,590
They're prisoners!

796
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:04,010
They hang pirates.

797
01:35:04,010 --> 01:35:05,130
We must help them.

798
01:35:05,130 --> 01:35:06,240
Let's go!

799
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,560
We found a way in.

800
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:17,340
Look at this, mountains of treasure.

801
01:35:19,650 --> 01:35:21,400
Wow...

802
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:24,400
Want some?

803
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:27,530
I'll give you plenty of rope.

804
01:35:27,530 --> 01:35:30,240
Have you reported
that we found Laputa?

805
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:31,160
Just about to.

806
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:34,600
Make the code good and complicated.

807
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:38,210
Hey! No looting!

808
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:41,960
The perfect distraction for those idiots.

809
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,770
What amazing roots.

810
01:36:00,770 --> 01:36:02,480
You can climb trees, can't you?

811
01:36:04,930 --> 01:36:06,320
I see a way.

812
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:41,640
No better than thieves.

813
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:44,650
If they reach the garden...!

814
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:47,030
Sheeta, let's find the stone!

815
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:52,450
It's the only way to stop them.

816
01:36:52,450 --> 01:36:54,530
I was wondering
why the clouds parted.

817
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:58,540
It was so they could land.

818
01:36:59,310 --> 01:37:01,500
Was it my spell...?

819
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:05,040
Muska was right.
The seal's broken.

820
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:08,380
The kingdom's waking up.

821
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:11,550
It's welcomed the visitor
with the stone.

822
01:37:12,370 --> 01:37:14,550
But Muska will become king.

823
01:37:15,370 --> 01:37:17,850
He's got much worse in mind.

824
01:37:17,850 --> 01:37:22,310
But what do I do
when I get the stone back...

825
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:24,100
That spell!

826
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:28,550
You mean... the destruction spell?

827
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:57,510
Down and around.

828
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:16,910
I'll go first.

829
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:37,680
It's here somewhere.

830
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:49,400
<i>Please God...</i>

831
01:38:55,260 --> 01:38:56,490
This is it!

832
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:08,500
It's that kid.

833
01:39:12,130 --> 01:39:12,920
No!

834
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:14,840
Don't shoot! Capture her.

835
01:39:16,790 --> 01:39:19,680
Well, if it isn't the little princess.

836
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:21,890
Sheeta! Damn!

837
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:26,060
What is it, Colonel?

838
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:30,560
The last of the pirates.
There's one right under you.

839
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:32,820
Yes sir!

840
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:37,450
Sheeta, wait for me!

841
01:39:38,350 --> 01:39:39,780
Pazu!

842
01:39:42,850 --> 01:39:43,990
Grenades!

843
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:46,000
Is that Pazu?

844
01:39:49,990 --> 01:39:51,250
What was that?

845
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,050
No, it wasn't.

846
01:40:01,970 --> 01:40:04,210
The General is over there.

847
01:40:04,210 --> 01:40:07,600
Militia, fall in on the double.

848
01:40:14,010 --> 01:40:14,730
Granny!

849
01:40:15,550 --> 01:40:17,240
They've got Sheeta.

850
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:20,490
I'm going after her.
I'll cut your ropes.

851
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:30,750
Get out of here.

852
01:40:31,030 --> 01:40:32,500
Hey, wait!

853
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:36,380
Take this.

854
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:39,080
Thanks.

855
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:44,260
The boy has become a man.

856
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:45,640
What?!

857
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:49,140
Muska destroyed
all the radio equipment?

858
01:40:49,140 --> 01:40:52,150
Yes, while the ship
was lightly guarded.

859
01:40:52,590 --> 01:40:55,110
Several guards
are badly wounded.

860
01:40:55,110 --> 01:40:57,400
The Colonel entered
the inner palace with the girl.

861
01:40:57,720 --> 01:40:59,490
The soldiers saw him.

862
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:03,410
That upstart's finally
showing his colors.

863
01:41:03,410 --> 01:41:05,410
Hunt him down and arrest him!

864
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:06,860
All units!

865
01:41:06,860 --> 01:41:08,410
Hey! Hurry!

866
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:11,250
Shoot if he resists!

867
01:41:11,570 --> 01:41:13,370
Find the entrance.

868
01:41:34,970 --> 01:41:37,400
Where are we, Colonel?

869
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:41,150
Laputa's core. The castle
above is just a trifle.

870
01:41:41,930 --> 01:41:46,160
All of Laputa's knowledge
is crystallized here.

871
01:41:51,650 --> 01:41:53,330
You two wait here.

872
01:41:53,330 --> 01:41:54,670
Colonel!

873
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:58,670
Only royalty may enter
the sacred area.

874
01:42:01,780 --> 01:42:02,920
What is this!

875
01:42:05,790 --> 01:42:08,180
The roots have invaded...

876
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:13,800
Eventually, we'll burn them all.

877
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:15,190
Come, this way.

878
01:42:26,350 --> 01:42:27,910
Confound it...

879
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:29,370
Yes...

880
01:42:30,020 --> 01:42:30,870
This is it!

881
01:42:38,990 --> 01:42:40,420
Here, too!

882
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:46,050
Curse it...

883
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:56,770
Found it!

884
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:06,780
Behold the giant crystal!
Source of Laputa's power.

885
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:12,290
Fantastic. It has awaited
the king's return for 700 years.

886
01:43:12,290 --> 01:43:13,580
700 years?

887
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:18,070
Your family forgot even that?

888
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:28,380
The black rock!
As the epics described!

889
01:43:34,430 --> 01:43:36,390
I can read it.
I know what it says!

890
01:43:38,090 --> 01:43:39,400
Just who are you?

891
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:46,110
I too have an ancient,
secret name, Lucita.

892
01:43:46,110 --> 01:43:48,910
My name is Romuska Palo Ur Laputa.

893
01:43:52,030 --> 01:43:56,410
We are descended
from the same royal family.

894
01:43:57,230 --> 01:43:59,920
Later it split into two branches.

895
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:11,550
Not even a crack.

896
01:44:11,550 --> 01:44:13,050
It's indestructible.

897
01:44:13,420 --> 01:44:15,470
Deploy all our explosives.

898
01:44:15,470 --> 01:44:19,060
<i>Force won't be necessary,</i>
<i>Your Excellency.</i>

899
01:44:19,060 --> 01:44:20,560
Muska, where are you!

900
01:45:13,950 --> 01:45:19,450
<i>What are you waiting for, General?</i>

901
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:22,800
All right, after me!

902
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,550
Forward!

903
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:41,310
What is this! Muska, where are you?

904
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:43,020
<i>Silence!</i>

905
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:49,610
What on earth!

906
01:45:51,850 --> 01:45:56,070
<i>Watch your tongue. You're in</i>
<i>the presence of Laputa's king.</i>

907
01:45:56,390 --> 01:45:58,080
Are you insane?

908
01:45:58,350 --> 01:46:04,330
<i>Let's celebrate Laputa's return</i>
<i>with a demonstration of its power.</i>

909
01:46:05,070 --> 01:46:05,830
Sheeta!

910
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:09,840
<i>Behold Laputa's thunder!</i>

911
01:46:10,410 --> 01:46:11,670
Sheeta.

912
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:38,070
<i>It's the heavenly fire that</i>
<i>destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.</i>

913
01:46:38,390 --> 01:46:42,080
<i>It's the Ramayana's Arrow of Indra.</i>

914
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:46,330
<i>The world shall bow down</i>
<i>before Laputa once more!</i>

915
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:53,280
Wonderful, Muska. You're a hero.
A monumental achievement.

916
01:46:59,790 --> 01:47:03,350
<i>I grow tired</i>
<i>of your stupid face.</i>

917
01:47:06,250 --> 01:47:07,560
Run, everyone!

918
01:47:08,470 --> 01:47:09,610
<i>Die!</i>

919
01:47:36,990 --> 01:47:39,540
- It's those monsters!
- Look at them...

920
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:40,640
Run!

921
01:47:45,340 --> 01:47:47,520
Are the Flaptors OK?

922
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:50,310
Ready to fly!

923
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:51,690
Let's hurry!

924
01:47:51,690 --> 01:47:55,320
Quiet. Keep your voice down.

925
01:48:01,980 --> 01:48:06,250
What are those two doing?
I'll have to leave them behind.

926
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:10,670
I advise you not to anger me.

927
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:16,460
We'll be alone here
for a long time.

928
01:48:22,370 --> 01:48:24,100
They should've escaped.

929
01:48:28,550 --> 01:48:30,600
You think you can fight me?

930
01:48:59,080 --> 01:48:59,880
Robots!

931
01:49:36,610 --> 01:49:38,210
Sheeta!

932
01:49:46,790 --> 01:49:48,350
Fantastic!

933
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:51,520
A marvelous display, no?

934
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:56,290
Die, you insects!

935
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:00,110
How dare you!

936
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:05,430
Damn!

937
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:15,580
Be a good girl, give it back.

938
01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:19,150
Please, open!

939
01:50:27,660 --> 01:50:29,720
Just where will you go?

940
01:50:31,670 --> 01:50:33,270
Open!

941
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:53,830
Sheeta!

942
01:51:22,390 --> 01:51:23,450
Pazu!

943
01:51:23,450 --> 01:51:23,980
Sheeta!

944
01:51:23,980 --> 01:51:25,220
I'm coming.

945
01:51:26,350 --> 01:51:27,700
Get back!

946
01:51:27,910 --> 01:51:31,410
Take this, hurry!
Muska's coming, quick!

947
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:41,170
Throw it into the sea.

948
01:51:47,630 --> 01:51:52,180
Hold onto that stone.
I'll trade her life for it.

949
01:52:20,780 --> 01:52:23,840
Get up! No more hide and seek.

950
01:52:30,450 --> 01:52:34,850
How delightful that it should end
in the throne room. Come here!

951
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:39,350
The throne room?
This will be our grave.

952
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:44,820
What is a king when his
country lies ruined?

953
01:52:44,820 --> 01:52:46,610
I won't give you the stone.

954
01:52:46,610 --> 01:52:50,400
You'll die, trapped here with me.
There's no escape.

955
01:52:51,310 --> 01:52:55,140
This is why Laputa died out.

956
01:52:56,150 --> 01:53:00,830
There's a song in my valley...
<i>Put down your roots in the soil...</i>

957
01:53:00,830 --> 01:53:02,790
<i>Live together with the wind.</i>

958
01:53:02,790 --> 01:53:07,420
<i>Pass the winter with the seeds,</i>
<i>sing in the spring with the birds...</i>

959
01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:13,140
Your weapons may be powerful.
Your pitiful robots may be many.

960
01:53:13,140 --> 01:53:15,220
But you can't survive
apart from the earth.

961
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:22,850
Laputa will not die. It will rise again.

962
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:26,230
Its power is the stuff of
humanity's dreams.

963
01:53:28,510 --> 01:53:32,150
Next, I shoot off your ears!

964
01:53:32,150 --> 01:53:36,840
Beg for your life. Make the kid
hand over the stone.

965
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:38,870
Wait!

966
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:43,420
The stone's hidden. You can shoot,
but you won't get it.

967
01:53:43,860 --> 01:53:48,500
Stay away, Pazu.
He'll kill us both.

968
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:52,720
I'll spare her life if you tell me
where the stone is.

969
01:53:53,700 --> 01:53:58,180
Or do you intend to conquer me
with that cannon of yours?

970
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:02,060
Let me talk to Sheeta alone.

971
01:54:02,060 --> 01:54:04,810
Run away.
Take the stone and run!

972
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:08,400
Three minutes.

973
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:35,220
Sheeta, calm down and listen.
Teach me that spell.

974
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:38,640
I'll say it with you.

975
01:54:39,580 --> 01:54:41,640
Put your hand in mine.

976
01:54:51,430 --> 01:54:53,650
I cut the pirates' ropes.

977
01:54:58,430 --> 01:55:00,450
Time's up. What do you say?

978
01:55:43,650 --> 01:55:47,250
My eyes! My eyes!

979
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:54,160
I can't see...

980
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:09,270
Mama, it's collapsing!

981
01:56:09,270 --> 01:56:11,400
All right, let's go.
Hurry!

982
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:12,730
Hurry!

983
01:56:24,190 --> 01:56:26,910
Look, the bottom's falling out!

984
01:57:17,410 --> 01:57:20,380
Sheeta was such a nice girl...

985
01:57:20,590 --> 01:57:23,400
They used the spell of destruction.

986
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:27,010
Those kids saved Laputa
from those idiots.

987
01:57:30,380 --> 01:57:32,060
It's stopping!

988
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:41,570
A crystal! A humongous one!

989
01:57:41,570 --> 01:57:43,160
It's rising.

990
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:53,710
The tree... it's carrying
it away. Chase it!

991
01:57:53,710 --> 01:57:56,050
You're heavy, get off.

992
01:57:56,050 --> 01:57:57,170
I can't!

993
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:29,660
Sheeta.

994
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:35,290
Pazu...

995
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:42,710
The roots protected us.

996
01:58:59,010 --> 01:59:00,480
We can still use this.

997
01:59:01,180 --> 01:59:02,360
Here goes.

998
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:15,430
What are you doing?
We're not moving.

999
02:00:15,430 --> 02:00:18,600
Of course not, we're overloaded.

1000
