1
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:32,917
This is the fire brigade.
Is anybody here?

2
00:01:34,054 --> 00:01:36,047
Please wait outside.

3
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:38,805
What's the date of the last letter?

4
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:40,928
The 9th, as far as I can see.

5
00:02:09,464 --> 00:02:11,088
The door is open!

6
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,175
...no as far as I know.
During the whole time, they had a nurse,

7
00:02:16,176 --> 00:02:18,547
but it's been a while since I last
saw her. My wife has been...

8
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,555
- Did you open the window?
- No.

9
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:40,989
LOVE

10
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,958
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
the Théâtre des Champs Elysées.

11
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:33,335
We ask you to turn off
your mobile phones.

12
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:37,627
and remind you that all forms of video
and audio recordings are prohibited.

13
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,292
We hope you enjoy the concert.

14
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:41,413
They used a screwdriver or something
similar. Doesn't look very professional.

15
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:44,170
- But who would do something like that?
- No idea.

16
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:48,007
Why someone would try to break in?
Because he wants to steal something.

17
00:05:48,137 --> 00:05:50,046
- From us?
- Why not?

18
00:05:50,264 --> 00:05:54,476
If I come to think about it
three or four people we know

19
00:05:54,602 --> 00:05:55,847
have already been burgled.

20
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:57,936
What time is it?
Can't we call the caretaker?

21
00:05:58,064 --> 00:05:59,748
I'll do that tomorrow morning.

22
00:05:59,997 --> 00:06:02,604
Don't let this put a damper
on your good mood.

23
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:08,773
- Or call the police?
- Come, give me your coat.

24
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,916
Imagine if we were lying in bed
and somebody broke in.

25
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:23,536
Why should I imagine such a thing?

26
00:06:23,673 --> 00:06:26,793
It's terrible.
I think I would die of fright.

27
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:28,420
I would too.

28
00:06:30,012 --> 00:06:33,132
- Shall we have a drink?
- I'm tired.

29
00:06:34,725 --> 00:06:36,848
I fancy another drink.

30
00:06:37,352 --> 00:06:38,847
Do as you please.

31
00:06:40,856 --> 00:06:43,312
Matilda told me
that in her building

32
00:06:43,442 --> 00:06:46,396
burglars entered the top floor
through the attic.

33
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:49,027
They simply knocked
a hole into the wall,

34
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:52,058
cut the most valuable paintings
out of their frames

35
00:06:52,476 --> 00:06:55,088
and disappeared
without leaving a trace.

36
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:57,488
That's how professionals do it.

37
00:07:03,461 --> 00:07:06,665
Did I tell you that I thought
you looked very pretty tonight.

38
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:08,292
What's gotten into you?

39
00:07:16,808 --> 00:07:21,020
The semiquavers in the presto
were incredible. What subtlety!

40
00:07:22,064 --> 00:07:23,605
Don't you think?

41
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,065
You're proud of him, huh?

42
00:07:51,634 --> 00:07:52,832
What's the matter.

43
00:07:56,055 --> 00:07:57,430
Nothing.

44
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,970
Next week?

45
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:05,017
No. Yes.

46
00:08:05,607 --> 00:08:08,477
No, but it would be better to fix this
as soon as possible.

47
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:12,566
It might give people silly ideas.

48
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:15,153
And anyway, it's ugly to look at.

49
00:08:16,575 --> 00:08:17,820
At what time?

50
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:21,949
Yes, okay.
All right.

51
00:08:22,957 --> 00:08:25,199
Will you also bring
the varnish with you?

52
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:30,501
But at least some primer.

53
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,378
Yes, okay.
Excellent.

54
00:08:34,468 --> 00:08:35,548
Yes.

55
00:08:36,386 --> 00:08:39,173
Well, thank you.
Goodbye. Thank you.

56
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:44,102
- He's reliable.
- I hope so.

57
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,102
The last time he kept us
waiting for ages, if you remember.

58
00:08:48,232 --> 00:08:49,809
Yes, that's true.
Thank you.

59
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:56,192
But if I call a regular company, they
let us wait for at least two months.

60
00:08:56,615 --> 00:08:57,694
Oh yeah?

61
00:09:07,584 --> 00:09:11,712
The Frodons had to wait for three days
when their toilet was clogged.

62
00:09:12,255 --> 00:09:14,082
Not exactly pleasant.

63
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:19,212
The salt cellar is empty.

64
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:37,483
I don't know if he's going
to bring us the CD today.

65
00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:40,107
Maybe he won't come at all.

66
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:45,616
We could go to Virgin
this afternoon and buy it.

67
00:09:46,581 --> 00:09:47,744
What do you say?

68
00:09:52,628 --> 00:09:54,003
What's going on?

69
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,583
What's the matter?
Anne?

70
00:10:00,594 --> 00:10:01,674
Cuckoo.

71
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,212
I'm here

72
00:10:06,225 --> 00:10:06,841
Anne.

73
00:10:08,603 --> 00:10:10,097
What's going on?

74
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:17,193
Anne, what's going on?

75
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:23,898
What's the matter?

76
00:11:05,575 --> 00:11:06,773
Anne...

77
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,451
Anne, darling, please.

78
00:11:15,585 --> 00:11:19,250
Anne, look at me.
What's the matter?

79
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,425
What's the matter?

80
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:16,931
Anne?

81
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:43,291
What are you doing?

82
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,789
You left the water running.

83
00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:49,214
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Are you completely crazy?

84
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:53,295
- Is this a joke?
- What?

85
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:57,263
Is this a joke?
Is this supposed to be a joke?

86
00:12:57,394 --> 00:12:59,885
What joke?
I don't get it.

87
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:03,435
Why do you talk to me in that tone?
What has gotten into you?

88
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:07,105
Please, Anne, stop this game,
it's not funny.

89
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:10,071
What game, for Christ's sake?
What's the matter?

90
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,408
Why did you not react?

91
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:23,080
- To what?
- To what? Uh, to everything, to me.

92
00:13:23,211 --> 00:13:25,500
- When?
- Just now. A moment ago.

93
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,497
Please, tell me, what's wrong.

94
00:13:30,884 --> 00:13:32,509
I don't know what to say.

95
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:36,379
You really don't remember
what just happened?

96
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,973
But what did happen?

97
00:13:42,313 --> 00:13:46,014
You were sitting there,
staring into space

98
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,270
and you didn't answer
when I asked you what the matter was.

99
00:13:51,823 --> 00:13:55,902
I took this towel and put it
on your face but you didn't react.

100
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:59,362
Look, there's still dampness
on your collar.

101
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:07,458
And when... when was it?

102
00:14:07,588 --> 00:14:10,257
Just now, a couple of minutes ago.

103
00:14:11,175 --> 00:14:13,927
- So?
- So? There's no "so".

104
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:18,346
I went into the bedroom to get dressed.
I wanted to get help.

105
00:14:18,473 --> 00:14:19,884
- Help?
- Yes.

106
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:22,259
But then you turned off the tap.

107
00:14:22,852 --> 00:14:25,390
Yes, because you left it on.

108
00:14:30,277 --> 00:14:31,605
I don't understand.

109
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,943
Me neither.

110
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,450
I should call Dr. Bertier.

111
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:41,577
- Why? What can he do?
- I don't know. Examine you.

112
00:14:41,704 --> 00:14:43,613
I am fine, I am fine.

113
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,041
Please, Anne.

114
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:50,918
It's absurd, we cannot go on
as if nothing had happened.

115
00:14:51,047 --> 00:14:53,455
But what did happen?

116
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,422
I'm sitting here, having breakfast

117
00:14:56,761 --> 00:14:59,431
and you're telling me things
I don't understand.

118
00:15:01,057 --> 00:15:04,261
Can you explain to me
how the tea towel got here?

119
00:15:04,394 --> 00:15:05,306
No.

120
00:15:05,728 --> 00:15:08,397
- Who turned the tap on?
- You did.

121
00:15:10,024 --> 00:15:12,729
- Oh, you remember that?
- No.

122
00:15:14,362 --> 00:15:16,188
Do you want to torture me?

123
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:18,274
Leave me in peace.

124
00:15:20,993 --> 00:15:23,449
Don't you think
I'd better call Dr. Bertier?

125
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:24,575
No!

126
00:16:13,921 --> 00:16:14,839
You know how he is.

127
00:16:14,944 --> 00:16:17,560
Once he's got something into his head,
he has to go through with it.

128
00:16:18,091 --> 00:16:20,582
In the end
everyone was delighted.

129
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,884
Besides, it didn't hurt
our financial situation.

130
00:16:23,888 --> 00:16:27,637
So, we're playing until the 28th,
then we have a ten-day break

131
00:16:27,934 --> 00:16:32,513
then we go to Stockholm for four days
and then to Kuhmo in Finland.

132
00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:35,310
I don't know where that is.
At the North Pole.

133
00:16:36,234 --> 00:16:38,856
Geoff has already been there a few times,
he loves it.

134
00:16:39,154 --> 00:16:41,727
We're playing the "Dowland
Transcriptions" there.

135
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:44,898
Then we return to London.

136
00:16:46,243 --> 00:16:47,786
What about the children?

137
00:16:49,664 --> 00:16:55,749
Liz is at her boarding school
and John lives his own life. He's 26.

138
00:16:58,298 --> 00:16:59,792
What does he do?

139
00:17:02,343 --> 00:17:05,547
He works.
He is very independent.

140
00:17:06,556 --> 00:17:08,133
We rarely see him.

141
00:17:10,517 --> 00:17:12,261
A bit like Geoff.

142
00:17:13,228 --> 00:17:15,186
They don't really get along.

143
00:17:16,482 --> 00:17:20,776
Geoff wants to advise him on everything.
John doesn't like that at all.

144
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:25,031
- Is he good?
- Yes, I think so.

145
00:17:27,076 --> 00:17:30,410
He is less impulsive,
but very industrious.

146
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,323
This sounds rather depreciatory.

147
00:17:33,457 --> 00:17:35,745
No. He's just not like Geoff.

148
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:37,710
He is...

149
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:42,794
calm, but stubborn.
I think he'll do all right.

150
00:17:43,926 --> 00:17:47,840
The other day he played the solo part
of the Haydn concerto

151
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:50,926
at the conservatoire's last concert.

152
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,345
It was very good.

153
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:56,810
Geoff was there
and he congratulated him at the end.

154
00:17:59,315 --> 00:18:00,347
And you?

155
00:18:02,527 --> 00:18:03,558
What do you mean?

156
00:18:06,823 --> 00:18:08,448
Did you both make up?

157
00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:11,993
Oh, you know him.

158
00:18:15,457 --> 00:18:19,206
In September, he discovered his love
for a violinist,

159
00:18:19,336 --> 00:18:21,707
who had been in our ensemble
for many years.

160
00:18:23,297 --> 00:18:24,412
What can I tell you?

161
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:27,715
It was a huge drama.
She tried to commit suicide.

162
00:18:27,844 --> 00:18:32,091
That scared him.
He returned to me, devoured by remorse.

163
00:18:35,018 --> 00:18:37,591
I've got used to it by now, but...

164
00:18:37,896 --> 00:18:40,932
I feel embarrassed because
the whole ensemble knows about it.

165
00:18:43,485 --> 00:18:44,646
Do you love him?

166
00:18:46,153 --> 00:18:47,434
Yes, I think so.

167
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,781
What about the surgery?

168
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:03,744
What do you want me to explain?

169
00:19:03,921 --> 00:19:05,629
They made a test,

170
00:19:05,757 --> 00:19:09,670
said the carotid artery was blocked
and that surgery would be necessary.

171
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:12,802
She was scared.

172
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:16,467
Totally confused, frightened.

173
00:19:17,643 --> 00:19:20,597
You know
she's always been afraid of doctors.

174
00:19:21,981 --> 00:19:26,578
They said the risk was very low
and that if they didn't operate,

175
00:19:26,891 --> 00:19:31,719
she'd be certain
to have another, more serious stroke.

176
00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:34,566
And what do they say now?

177
00:19:35,368 --> 00:19:37,361
That it didn't go well.

178
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,333
It's one of the 5% that go wrong.

179
00:19:52,469 --> 00:19:54,794
It's pretty upsetting.

180
00:19:57,014 --> 00:19:59,885
Usually at this time, I take a nap.

181
00:20:01,394 --> 00:20:04,644
My blood sugar
is somewhere down in my socks.

182
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:10,021
- I'm so sorry.
- Yes.

183
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,370
- What can I do for you?
- Nothing.

184
00:20:18,745 --> 00:20:23,038
It was very nice of you to come
despite all of your stress.

185
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:27,585
No, honestly,
there's nothing you can do.

186
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:31,711
We'll see how things go
when she's back here in the apartment.

187
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:34,752
We'll manage all right.

188
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,508
Maybe I'll hire a home health aide,

189
00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:42,136
maybe I'll manage on my own.
We'll see.

190
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:48,061
We've been through a lot together,
your mother and I.

191
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,688
All this is still a bit new.

192
00:20:55,781 --> 00:20:59,050
It's funny. I don't know if I should
tell you as it might embarrass you

193
00:20:59,238 --> 00:21:00,667
but when I came in earlier

194
00:21:00,813 --> 00:21:04,211
I remembered how I always used to listen
to the two of you making love as a child.

195
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:07,786
This always reassured me.

196
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:10,624
It gave me a feeling
that you loved each other

197
00:21:10,754 --> 00:21:12,877
and that we'd always be together.

198
00:21:18,553 --> 00:21:20,630
- Watch your fingers!
- Yeah.

199
00:21:57,676 --> 00:22:00,000
Put this next to the window.
Thank you.

200
00:22:00,136 --> 00:22:01,215
Certainly, sir.

201
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:04,503
Sorry.

202
00:22:11,064 --> 00:22:13,389
- This is for both of you.
- Thank you.

203
00:22:13,524 --> 00:22:15,850
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

204
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:19,983
Thank you, Mr. Méry.

205
00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:23,280
If you need anything,
just call downstairs.

206
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:26,410
- If we can help you in one way or another...
- Right now everything's fine.

207
00:22:26,537 --> 00:22:30,120
I'll let your wife know
as soon as we need anything.

208
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:33,074
Good to have you back,
Mrs. Laurent.

209
00:22:33,377 --> 00:22:35,749
Yes, thank you, Mr. Méry.
Thank you.

210
00:22:36,172 --> 00:22:39,173
If... If you need anything...

211
00:22:39,342 --> 00:22:40,836
Yes, thank you.

212
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:45,591
Goodbye then, ma'am.
Welcome home again.

213
00:22:46,557 --> 00:22:49,972
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye, Mr. Méry, thank you.

214
00:23:02,364 --> 00:23:04,024
Where do you want...

215
00:23:04,408 --> 00:23:05,736
In the living room.

216
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,773
Shall I make some tea?

217
00:23:45,949 --> 00:23:48,237
First come sit with me.

218
00:24:10,097 --> 00:24:13,763
- Can you help me into the arm chair?
- Yes, of course.

219
00:24:14,727 --> 00:24:16,186
Come closer.

220
00:24:16,687 --> 00:24:19,688
Put your knees against mine
so I don't slip.

221
00:24:20,817 --> 00:24:23,390
Put your right arm around me.

222
00:24:24,153 --> 00:24:26,110
And lift me up.

223
00:24:27,072 --> 00:24:28,566
And up!

224
00:24:49,302 --> 00:24:50,333
Here.

225
00:25:16,913 --> 00:25:19,238
I'm so glad you're back.

226
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:22,292
So am I.

227
00:25:31,511 --> 00:25:33,919
- Promise me one thing.
- What?

228
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:38,801
Please never take me back
to the hospital.

229
00:25:40,436 --> 00:25:41,266
What?

230
00:25:43,231 --> 00:25:44,725
You promise?

231
00:25:46,442 --> 00:25:48,684
- Anne...
- You promise?

232
00:25:50,988 --> 00:25:52,815
- Anne, I'm...
- Don't talk right now.

233
00:25:54,325 --> 00:25:58,026
Don't give me any lectures.
Please.

234
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,541
- What can I say?
- Nothing.

235
00:26:05,127 --> 00:26:06,538
Just don't say anything.

236
00:26:08,797 --> 00:26:09,877
Okay?

237
00:26:30,986 --> 00:26:32,314
Thank you.

238
00:26:35,866 --> 00:26:37,444
Thank you, dear.

239
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:44,708
- Everything fine?
- Everything is fine.

240
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:50,171
You don't have to hold my hand
all the time.

241
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,953
I can look after myself,
you know.

242
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:56,719
And don't feel guilty.
That would be pointless.

243
00:26:56,845 --> 00:26:59,680
And a drag for me too.

244
00:27:00,974 --> 00:27:03,643
- I don't feel guilty.
- That's good.

245
00:27:06,313 --> 00:27:07,890
Go over there now.

246
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,482
I'm not a cripple.

247
00:27:11,944 --> 00:27:15,940
You can easily leave me alone
for two minutes. I won't collapse.

248
00:27:16,989 --> 00:27:17,985
Okay.

249
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:23,161
Did you buy the new book
on Harnoncourt?

250
00:27:23,621 --> 00:27:25,863
- I've already read it.
- And?

251
00:27:26,332 --> 00:27:28,539
Do you want it?
Shall I get it for you?

252
00:27:28,835 --> 00:27:30,163
Please do.

253
00:27:40,596 --> 00:27:42,635
I don't know where I put it.

254
00:27:43,182 --> 00:27:46,432
- Don't worry. It's not that important.
- Yes it is.

255
00:27:47,311 --> 00:27:51,060
I think I left it...

256
00:27:56,571 --> 00:27:58,148
Ah, here it is!

257
00:27:59,198 --> 00:28:01,736
Nothing like an infallible memory!

258
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,874
I thought I had left it
in the small bedroom

259
00:28:10,751 --> 00:28:15,792
but I had already put it away.
Tidy people just can't help being tidy.

260
00:28:17,091 --> 00:28:18,289
Thank you.

261
00:28:22,054 --> 00:28:25,055
Good, now do something for yourself.

262
00:28:25,766 --> 00:28:30,143
Don't stay here to see
how I hold the book, okay?

263
00:28:30,395 --> 00:28:31,308
Okay.

264
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:37,935
I'll leave the door open.

265
00:29:46,136 --> 00:29:48,806
Unfortunately the strawberries
were already moldy.

266
00:29:49,515 --> 00:29:53,098
I'll go and get you some fresh ones
tomorrow morning from the market.

267
00:29:56,397 --> 00:29:59,351
My husband will bring you
the Evian water this afternoon.

268
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:01,939
I'm not supposed to carry anything
heavy. My back, you know.

269
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:03,398
No problem.

270
00:30:06,198 --> 00:30:10,694
It came to 76.40.
Here's the receipt.

271
00:30:12,287 --> 00:30:15,787
- Your change, 23.60.
- Keep the small change.

272
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:17,583
Thank you, sir.

273
00:30:19,795 --> 00:30:23,923
Well, I'll be going then.
Call me if you need anything.

274
00:30:24,091 --> 00:30:25,419
I will.

275
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:35,715
- Is your wife doing well?
- Yes. She's recovering.

276
00:30:36,061 --> 00:30:38,812
That's good.
Give her my regards.

277
00:30:39,481 --> 00:30:42,186
My husband and I are very glad
she's back.

278
00:30:42,317 --> 00:30:44,310
Yes, we are too.

279
00:30:44,861 --> 00:30:46,770
Goodbye, Mrs. Méry, thank you.

280
00:30:46,905 --> 00:30:48,981
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

281
00:30:54,912 --> 00:30:59,325
I'll bring you the strawberries
tomorrow around noon, if that suits you.

282
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:01,285
Yes, fine.
Thank you.

283
00:31:12,096 --> 00:31:14,338
- Can you come here, please.
- Yes.

284
00:33:00,369 --> 00:33:06,242
Some banal love story about a nobleman
and a lower middle class girl

285
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:07,522
who can't marry

286
00:33:07,692 --> 00:33:11,077
and who then, out of sheer magnanimity,
renounce their love for each other.

287
00:33:13,132 --> 00:33:16,217
In fact, I don't remember the story.

288
00:33:17,011 --> 00:33:21,719
In any case, I remember that I was
completely shaken up when I went out

289
00:33:21,932 --> 00:33:24,388
and that I needed some time
to calm down.

290
00:33:24,518 --> 00:33:25,514
Thank you.

291
00:33:28,314 --> 00:33:30,923
In the courtyard of the house
where grandma lived,

292
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:35,150
there was a young guy at the window
who asked me where I'd been.

293
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:37,787
He was a few years older than me.

294
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:42,695
He was a show-off
who of course really impressed me.

295
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:45,571
"To the cinema", I said to him.

296
00:33:45,914 --> 00:33:50,493
Because I was very proud grandma had given
me money to go all alone to the cinema.

297
00:33:51,795 --> 00:33:53,373
"What did you watch?"

298
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:56,127
I started to tell him the story

299
00:33:56,633 --> 00:34:00,880
and as I did,
all the emotion came back.

300
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:06,757
I didn't want to cry in front of this
guy, but it was impossible.

301
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:12,854
There I was, in tears in the courtyard,
and I told him the drama till the end.

302
00:34:18,863 --> 00:34:21,401
So? How did he react?

303
00:34:22,951 --> 00:34:26,367
No idea.
He probably laughed at me.

304
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,658
I don't remember.

305
00:34:29,124 --> 00:34:34,580
I don't remember the film either.
But I remember the feelings.

306
00:34:35,796 --> 00:34:37,754
I was ashamed to cry.

307
00:34:39,342 --> 00:34:43,340
But telling him the story made
all my feelings and tears come back,

308
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,930
maybe even stronger than
when I was actually watching the film.

309
00:34:47,558 --> 00:34:49,432
I just couldn't stop.

310
00:34:49,978 --> 00:34:53,062
That's sweet.
Why have you never told me this?

311
00:34:54,357 --> 00:34:57,523
There are still many stories
I've never told you.

312
00:35:00,696 --> 00:35:05,157
Don't tell me you're going to ruin
your image in your old age?

313
00:35:05,618 --> 00:35:07,278
You bet I won't.

314
00:35:08,287 --> 00:35:09,781
But what is my image?

315
00:35:14,543 --> 00:35:16,453
Sometimes you're a monster.

316
00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:19,669
But you're nice.

317
00:35:21,925 --> 00:35:23,799
Can I get you another drink?

318
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:28,218
Five.

319
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,019
Six.

320
00:35:36,023 --> 00:35:37,303
Seven.

321
00:35:39,777 --> 00:35:40,975
Eight.

322
00:35:43,447 --> 00:35:44,822
Nine.

323
00:35:47,659 --> 00:35:48,857
Ten.

324
00:35:50,078 --> 00:35:52,830
Up to fifteen.
Eleven.

325
00:35:56,209 --> 00:35:57,490
Twelve.

326
00:35:59,963 --> 00:36:01,422
Thirteen.

327
00:36:02,758 --> 00:36:04,300
Fourteen.

328
00:36:06,053 --> 00:36:07,132
And fifteen.

329
00:36:11,307 --> 00:36:13,513
- You're okay?
- I'm okay.

330
00:36:21,651 --> 00:36:24,569
Listen to this.
My horoscope.

331
00:36:25,822 --> 00:36:29,072
Motto: You have lots of verve,
but need to be more serious!

332
00:36:29,826 --> 00:36:34,487
Love: High-class conversation
is what you need.

333
00:36:34,955 --> 00:36:40,198
Work: You're motivated again.
But proceed with care.

334
00:36:40,711 --> 00:36:46,963
Health: Loosen up by doing exercises.
It'll give you renewed pizzazz.

335
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:52,385
You've got only yourself to blame
if you read this nonsense.

336
00:36:56,728 --> 00:36:59,396
Tomorrow afternoon
is Pierre's funeral.

337
00:37:00,397 --> 00:37:02,105
You've got to go.

338
00:37:02,816 --> 00:37:06,684
I fear I must.
Though I don't want to go at all.

339
00:37:07,404 --> 00:37:10,074
Few people like to go to funerals.

340
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:12,108
Oh, I know a few people who do.

341
00:37:12,993 --> 00:37:16,991
Annette, for instance,
cannot wait to get all dressed up.

342
00:37:17,498 --> 00:37:20,250
- And François, this idiot...
- You're mean.

343
00:37:20,501 --> 00:37:23,205
What would you say
if no one came to your funeral?

344
00:37:24,879 --> 00:37:26,956
Nothing, presumably.

345
00:37:31,428 --> 00:37:37,716
Have you talked to Jeanne
since I went to the hospital?

346
00:37:39,269 --> 00:37:40,929
Does she knows I can't come?

347
00:37:41,104 --> 00:37:43,097
Yes.
Of course.

348
00:37:43,524 --> 00:37:44,852
What did she say?

349
00:37:46,151 --> 00:37:48,688
- She was in shock.
- In what way?

350
00:37:49,195 --> 00:37:53,063
I don't know. What are people like
when they're shocked?

351
00:37:53,449 --> 00:37:56,783
She was speechless,
she couldn't believe it.

352
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,740
I don't know, well, not precisely.

353
00:38:01,082 --> 00:38:03,656
You know I've spoken
to a lot of people since.

354
00:38:06,046 --> 00:38:07,041
I'm sorry.

355
00:38:08,882 --> 00:38:10,080
No.

356
00:38:11,217 --> 00:38:14,253
Please forgive me.
I didn't mean to be unkind.

357
00:38:15,346 --> 00:38:19,130
But what's the point
of talking about it all the time.

358
00:38:19,684 --> 00:38:21,723
Do I talk about it all the time?

359
00:38:22,145 --> 00:38:23,140
No.

360
00:38:25,064 --> 00:38:26,227
I'm sorry.

361
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,155
What...

362
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,124
Why are you back already?
What time is it?

363
00:39:50,356 --> 00:39:53,025
Forgive me, I was too slow.

364
00:39:54,193 --> 00:39:56,945
- Anne...
- Can you wheel me into the living room?

365
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:01,447
Yes.

366
00:40:48,455 --> 00:40:51,456
You're always good at surprises.

367
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:52,996
Yes.

368
00:40:55,004 --> 00:40:56,996
Why did you come home earlier?

369
00:40:57,131 --> 00:41:00,085
I didn't come home earlier.
I took a taxi.

370
00:41:00,509 --> 00:41:02,834
On Saturdays
there's not a lot of traffic.

371
00:41:03,511 --> 00:41:04,591
That's true.

372
00:41:07,641 --> 00:41:09,301
How was the funeral?

373
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:10,763
Anne...

374
00:41:15,399 --> 00:41:18,103
How was it?
Come on, tell me!

375
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,130
It was rather bizarre.

376
00:41:49,933 --> 00:41:51,925
The priest was an idiot.

377
00:41:54,186 --> 00:41:58,979
A former colleague of Pierre's
came to make a speech

378
00:41:59,108 --> 00:42:02,109
that was embarrassingly emotional.

379
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:08,696
His former secretary
came with a mini cassette player

380
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:11,318
and put on "Yesterday" by the Beatles.

381
00:42:12,038 --> 00:42:13,497
You can't imagine.

382
00:42:14,374 --> 00:42:16,531
Everybody turned round
to look at her.

383
00:42:17,042 --> 00:42:19,498
Obviously, it was not planned.

384
00:42:20,254 --> 00:42:22,377
Pierre's grandchildren were there.

385
00:42:22,631 --> 00:42:27,092
Of course, they giggled
as soon as the music began.

386
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:28,674
Then

387
00:42:28,804 --> 00:42:32,884
the urn was put on a huge stretcher

388
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:36,802
that was obviously
designed for a coffin,

389
00:42:37,313 --> 00:42:39,351
and we went out into the rain.

390
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,689
They placed the urn
on a small electric cart

391
00:42:43,985 --> 00:42:46,358
that crawled along
for what seemed like an eternity

392
00:42:46,613 --> 00:42:49,187
to the small hole
that they had dug.

393
00:42:50,325 --> 00:42:52,365
Many people got the giggles.

394
00:42:53,745 --> 00:42:55,655
It must have been terrible for Jeanne.

395
00:42:55,789 --> 00:42:59,039
There's no point in going on living.
That's how it is.

396
00:43:01,337 --> 00:43:04,005
I know it can only get worse.

397
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:09,294
Why should I inflict this on us,
on you and me?

398
00:43:12,013 --> 00:43:13,840
You're not inflicting anything on me.

399
00:43:15,058 --> 00:43:17,549
You don't have to lie, Georges.

400
00:43:26,445 --> 00:43:28,602
Put yourself in my place.

401
00:43:29,697 --> 00:43:33,362
Didn't you ever think
that it could happen to me too?

402
00:43:33,492 --> 00:43:34,951
Of course, I did.

403
00:43:35,912 --> 00:43:39,494
But imagination and reality
have little in common.

404
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:43,993
- But things are getting better every day.
- I don't want to carry on.

405
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:48,873
You're making such sweet efforts
to make everything easier for me.

406
00:43:49,008 --> 00:43:50,503
But I don't want to go on.

407
00:43:51,052 --> 00:43:52,960
For my own sake.
Not yours.

408
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:56,554
I don't believe you.
I know you.

409
00:43:57,433 --> 00:43:59,924
You think you are a burden to me.

410
00:44:00,561 --> 00:44:03,562
But what would you do
in my place?

411
00:44:03,731 --> 00:44:07,515
I don't want to rack my brain
over this.

412
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:11,561
I'm tired, I want to go to bed.

413
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:34,445
Hello.
Nice to see you.

414
00:45:34,945 --> 00:45:36,737
I'm sorry to descend upon you like this.

415
00:45:36,864 --> 00:45:39,189
I tried many times to call you
but to no avail.

416
00:45:39,325 --> 00:45:42,990
I'm sorry. I only pick up the phone
when I've stored the caller's number

417
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,615
and I know who's calling.

418
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,241
But come on in.

419
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,584
I was so sorry that I couldn't manage
to come by after the concert.

420
00:45:51,379 --> 00:45:53,869
I was so pleased that you came.

421
00:45:54,506 --> 00:45:55,835
Come with me.

422
00:45:56,508 --> 00:45:58,584
Yesterday my agent called me.

423
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,967
Actually I'm goning to record
an album in June

424
00:46:01,096 --> 00:46:04,512
and I had to pick a location,
a piano.

425
00:46:04,725 --> 00:46:08,260
So I flew into Paris this morning,

426
00:46:08,604 --> 00:46:11,616
and once I was at my hotel, I thought,
I'll just give it a try and drop in.

427
00:46:11,886 --> 00:46:12,846
It's just around the corner.

428
00:46:13,046 --> 00:46:14,540
Very nice.

429
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:18,904
- This is for your spouse.
- Thank you.

430
00:46:19,447 --> 00:46:22,863
- Isn't she home?
- Yes she is. I'll get her in a minute.

431
00:46:22,993 --> 00:46:25,780
- Have a seat, please.
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.

432
00:46:25,912 --> 00:46:29,495
No, not at all. I'm very happy
to see you. Have a seat.

433
00:46:31,376 --> 00:46:35,588
We were so thrilled by your concert,
my wife and I.

434
00:46:36,256 --> 00:46:38,628
We hoped we'd see you again soon.

435
00:46:39,009 --> 00:46:42,045
Can I can get you something?

436
00:46:42,303 --> 00:46:44,212
- A cup of tea?
- No, thank you.

437
00:46:46,391 --> 00:46:50,223
I'll just put the flowers in a vase
and tell her that you are here.

438
00:46:50,478 --> 00:46:51,676
I'll be right back.

439
00:47:52,373 --> 00:47:56,370
Alexandre, I'm delighted.
How lovely to see you!

440
00:47:57,294 --> 00:48:00,663
Mrs. Laurent!
Lovely to see you too.

441
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:02,256
Don't get up.

442
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:04,164
Come on, sit down.

443
00:48:05,093 --> 00:48:07,003
And don't look so serious.

444
00:48:21,901 --> 00:48:23,728
I'm really proud of you.

445
00:48:25,238 --> 00:48:27,694
We were both in raptures
after your concert.

446
00:48:27,824 --> 00:48:31,952
Georges wanted to buy your new CD
the very next morning.

447
00:48:32,078 --> 00:48:36,242
Oh my God! I wanted to bring you one
but then I completely forgot about it.

448
00:48:36,374 --> 00:48:38,866
I left in such a hurry.

449
00:48:40,253 --> 00:48:43,871
- I'll get one today and drop it by.
- No, no, don't worry.

450
00:48:44,298 --> 00:48:49,007
We want to contribute to your success,
even it's only 20 euro.

451
00:48:49,303 --> 00:48:53,253
You have already contributed a lot.
I owe you so much, ma'am.

452
00:48:54,976 --> 00:48:57,645
You owe it to your hard work
and your talent.

453
00:48:59,355 --> 00:49:02,938
Do you remember, when you first gave me
the "Bagatelles" to play?

454
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:04,939
I was 12 years old.

455
00:49:06,696 --> 00:49:10,907
And in my youthful arrogance
I asked you: "But why the 'Bagatelles'?"

456
00:49:11,158 --> 00:49:15,073
Don't you remember? That day, you really
gave me a piece of your mind.

457
00:49:18,499 --> 00:49:20,242
What has happened to you?

458
00:49:22,545 --> 00:49:24,703
My right side is paralyzed, that's all.

459
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:26,666
This can happen when you get older.

460
00:49:28,009 --> 00:49:29,123
And how...

461
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:31,918
Let's talk about something else,
if you don't mind.

462
00:49:32,262 --> 00:49:33,211
Yes.

463
00:49:34,097 --> 00:49:35,592
Don't be offended.

464
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:39,799
But I want to enjoy the lovely interlude
you've given us with your visit.

465
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:42,933
Yes, of course.

466
00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:45,477
You haven't told us yet

467
00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:49,274
what's been going on
since the Paris concert.

468
00:49:49,822 --> 00:49:52,858
Well, I was in London
most of the time.

469
00:49:53,659 --> 00:49:55,201
I performed two concerts in Copenhagen,

470
00:49:55,327 --> 00:49:58,861
that was Schubert too.
The "Impromptu", the "Musical Moments".

471
00:49:59,331 --> 00:50:02,166
My whole life revolves
around Schubert at the moment.

472
00:50:02,459 --> 00:50:07,121
Ideally, I would like to record
the complete collection of sonatas.

473
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:11,210
Though I think I still need
a couple more years for the late ones.

474
00:50:11,343 --> 00:50:14,427
- Could you do me a favor?
- What?

475
00:50:16,348 --> 00:50:19,219
Would play the
"Bagatelle in G Minor" for me?

476
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,346
I haven't played it in a while.

477
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:29,101
I don't remember it very well.

478
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:32,777
- If you want, I can give it a try.
- Give it a try.

479
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:35,564
Okay.

480
00:52:32,982 --> 00:52:34,180
What's the matter?

481
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:16,708
What are you doing?

482
00:54:20,213 --> 00:54:22,372
Have you completely lost your mind?

483
00:54:23,008 --> 00:54:24,667
I can't believe it.

484
00:54:46,197 --> 00:54:47,941
See what you have done.

485
00:54:48,699 --> 00:54:52,198
Can't you call me
if you need something?

486
00:54:52,494 --> 00:54:53,739
I'm sorry.

487
00:54:53,912 --> 00:54:56,201
Yeah, I am too.

488
00:54:57,082 --> 00:54:58,197
Sorry.

489
00:54:59,627 --> 00:55:02,034
The lamp is broken, too.

490
00:55:34,411 --> 00:55:35,360
Yes?

491
00:55:38,456 --> 00:55:39,619
Who's there?

492
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:19,490
Anybody here?

493
00:56:24,711 --> 00:56:25,990
Is there anybody here?

494
00:57:04,124 --> 00:57:06,959
Georges, what's the matter?
What's going on?

495
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:10,578
Calm down, will you.

496
00:57:16,302 --> 00:57:17,797
What was it?

497
00:57:26,146 --> 00:57:29,182
Eva. They're coming on the 12th.

498
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:32,522
Why?

499
00:57:33,195 --> 00:57:37,145
No idea.
Apparently, she's coming with Geoff.

500
00:57:38,532 --> 00:57:39,777
When is it?

501
00:57:40,326 --> 00:57:43,161
I don't know exactly.
What day is it today?

502
00:57:45,164 --> 00:57:46,493
I'll go and look.

503
00:57:52,171 --> 00:57:53,452
I don't want that.

504
00:57:55,008 --> 00:57:55,838
What?

505
00:57:56,009 --> 00:57:58,963
Geoff doesn't need to come.
It's not necessary.

506
00:58:02,765 --> 00:58:05,635
I don't need any comments
on my predicament.

507
00:58:06,769 --> 00:58:10,185
I can only take his British humor
in small doses.

508
00:59:37,317 --> 00:59:40,151
Dear Mrs. Laurent
and Mr. Laurent.

509
00:59:40,986 --> 00:59:43,987
It was beautiful
and yet sad to see you.

510
00:59:44,281 --> 00:59:47,532
My heartfelt wishes
that things will get better.

511
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:51,989
With deepest sympathy,
your former pupil, Alexandre.

512
01:00:11,934 --> 01:00:13,428
Stop the CD.

513
01:01:02,567 --> 01:01:04,394
Where are the photo albums?

514
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:08,233
The photo albums?
I don't know.

515
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:12,282
In the small bedroom, I think.
Why?

516
01:01:12,786 --> 01:01:14,613
Can you get them for me?

517
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:16,451
Now?

518
01:01:17,748 --> 01:01:19,159
But why now?

519
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,208
I'd like to look at them.

520
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:25,542
Please.

521
01:01:57,913 --> 01:01:58,993
Thank you.

522
01:02:00,082 --> 01:02:01,197
You're welcome.

523
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,765
It's beautiful.

524
01:03:11,611 --> 01:03:12,607
What?

525
01:03:13,196 --> 01:03:14,441
Life.

526
01:03:17,576 --> 01:03:18,985
So long.

527
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:27,292
Long life.

528
01:03:33,341 --> 01:03:35,298
Stop watching me.

529
01:03:36,594 --> 01:03:38,421
I wasn't watching you.

530
01:03:40,598 --> 01:03:44,809
Of course you were.
I'm not that dumb yet.

531
01:03:46,353 --> 01:03:50,018
... the focus will be as much
on the how as on the what.

532
01:03:50,524 --> 01:03:52,481
Benjamin Netanyahu,

533
01:03:52,735 --> 01:03:57,313
is finally granted an official visit
with all the honours:

534
01:03:57,573 --> 01:04:02,235
handshake photo,
joint press conference,

535
01:04:02,495 --> 01:04:08,330
conspicuously demonstrating
the renewal of ties between Isreal...

536
01:04:08,792 --> 01:04:10,619
Israel and the United States.

537
01:05:02,428 --> 01:05:03,803
You're soaked through.

538
01:05:05,473 --> 01:05:08,142
- What do you mean?
- Hang on.

539
01:05:25,784 --> 01:05:27,195
It's no big deal.

540
01:05:48,724 --> 01:05:49,755
Come on.

541
01:06:08,369 --> 01:06:09,399
Wait.

542
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,038
Don't get all worked up.

543
01:07:09,053 --> 01:07:10,927
Calm down, calm down.

544
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:14,814
... thinking about
whether it wouldn't be better

545
01:07:15,076 --> 01:07:16,799
to invest the money
in an apartment block.

546
01:07:18,354 --> 01:07:22,600
If inflation gets going again,
property is the only sure thing.

547
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:28,442
Right now,
savings accounts pay 1.75% at best.

548
01:07:28,697 --> 01:07:30,405
That's a good rate already.

549
01:07:31,533 --> 01:07:34,867
Four years ago, Geoff bought

550
01:07:35,162 --> 01:07:38,911
shares for a small amount of money,
and the whole thing collapsed.

551
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:42,701
So now we're obviously worried.

552
01:07:45,089 --> 01:07:46,630
In the meantime,

553
01:07:48,341 --> 01:07:52,505
other people have had the same idea
and property prices are soaring.

554
01:07:57,476 --> 01:07:59,055
Since I came back from Scandinavia,

555
01:07:59,264 --> 01:08:01,593
I spend my spare time
going through the classifieds.

556
01:08:12,198 --> 01:08:13,526
We'll see.

557
01:08:14,659 --> 01:08:17,613
It takes time.
We'll find something in the end.

558
01:08:29,341 --> 01:08:31,547
I have...

559
01:08:33,553 --> 01:08:35,509
the grandmother...

560
01:08:37,973 --> 01:08:41,841
woman with house...

561
01:08:43,813 --> 01:08:45,141
not...

562
01:08:47,984 --> 01:08:49,359
house then...

563
01:08:53,281 --> 01:08:54,692
money...

564
01:09:02,706 --> 01:09:06,371
I'm... Sorry, Mum,
I don't understand you.

565
01:09:07,211 --> 01:09:09,453
I don't understand
what you say.

566
01:09:13,884 --> 01:09:15,047
yes...

567
01:09:15,469 --> 01:09:16,750
straight away...

568
01:09:19,724 --> 01:09:21,218
it's all...

569
01:09:23,394 --> 01:09:25,801
house sel...

570
01:09:28,023 --> 01:09:29,351
sel...

571
01:09:33,195 --> 01:09:36,813
not...
in two strokes...

572
01:09:41,203 --> 01:09:43,112
so quickly...

573
01:09:48,334 --> 01:09:49,532
God...

574
01:09:51,629 --> 01:09:53,421
it's hard...

575
01:09:55,341 --> 01:09:56,836
say...

576
01:09:57,844 --> 01:10:00,169
house sol...

577
01:10:01,806 --> 01:10:04,724
money gone...

578
01:10:07,062 --> 01:10:08,390
gone...

579
01:10:11,733 --> 01:10:17,901
al...so the... the... the... the... hou...se

580
01:10:18,322 --> 01:10:19,354
Yes.

581
01:10:23,202 --> 01:10:24,531
Whose house?

582
01:10:30,126 --> 01:10:31,122
The house of...

583
01:10:31,252 --> 01:10:34,586
also... grandmother...

584
01:10:35,423 --> 01:10:37,331
grandmother...

585
01:11:02,074 --> 01:11:03,900
Three times a week.

586
01:11:04,284 --> 01:11:07,867
I'm not experienced enough.
We'll see if that's enough.

587
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,788
How much is she asking?

588
01:11:10,457 --> 01:11:13,826
It's paid by the hour.
We'll see.

589
01:11:15,713 --> 01:11:16,412
And her?

590
01:11:17,589 --> 01:11:18,538
Anne?

591
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:21,801
It's hard to say.

592
01:11:21,927 --> 01:11:26,423
Sometimes I get the feeling she's
totally unaware of the state she's in.

593
01:11:26,556 --> 01:11:28,881
But in the next moment
I feel the opposite.

594
01:11:29,726 --> 01:11:31,304
And what does the doctor say?

595
01:11:32,145 --> 01:11:33,059
He...

596
01:11:37,818 --> 01:11:39,609
She only talks gibberish.

597
01:11:50,705 --> 01:11:52,329
What's going on?

598
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:56,032
We can't just leave her lying
on her bed like that!

599
01:11:56,169 --> 01:11:58,576
She's unrecognizable!
It's ridiculous!

600
01:11:58,755 --> 01:12:00,342
There's nothing we can do
at the moment.

601
01:12:00,569 --> 01:12:03,065
She's undergoing treatment,
gets medication.

602
01:12:04,928 --> 01:12:07,086
There are no other options
right now.

603
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:10,388
What does that mean, "no other options"?
Why not put her in the hospital?

604
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:13,601
She had a second stroke.

605
01:12:14,436 --> 01:12:16,014
Bertier examined her

606
01:12:16,147 --> 01:12:20,061
and felt we could spare her
all the hospital inpatient procedures.

607
01:12:20,234 --> 01:12:22,642
Anyway, they wouldn't keep her.

608
01:12:22,862 --> 01:12:26,029
They'd send her to a care home
with nursing.

609
01:12:26,574 --> 01:12:29,777
What they do in those places,
we can do here.

610
01:12:29,994 --> 01:12:33,659
And she won't be put in a care home.

611
01:12:34,957 --> 01:12:36,618
I promised her that.

612
01:12:37,877 --> 01:12:40,794
Don't you think
you're taking on too much?

613
01:12:41,213 --> 01:12:43,122
Have you got a better idea?

614
01:12:47,761 --> 01:12:52,589
I can't believe that these days
there is not a more effective treatment.

615
01:12:52,892 --> 01:12:55,347
No one's stopping you
from finding out.

616
01:12:57,438 --> 01:13:01,222
I take it you believe me when I say
I love your mother as much as you do.

617
01:13:01,359 --> 01:13:04,062
So please, don't treat me
as if I was a total idiot

618
01:13:04,194 --> 01:13:07,195
incapable of doing the obvious.

619
01:13:07,489 --> 01:13:09,149
I didn't say that.

620
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:13,658
I'm simply questioning whether what I
see going on here is the best solution.

621
01:13:14,496 --> 01:13:16,239
Don't you want to get
a second opinion?

622
01:13:16,915 --> 01:13:18,824
Stop it, both of you.

623
01:13:19,459 --> 01:13:22,710
Another doctor did come.
He agrees with Bertier.

624
01:13:23,005 --> 01:13:26,071
From Monday, a nurse will come
three times a week.

625
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:27,616
Is that good enough?

626
01:13:27,895 --> 01:13:30,690
Now can we talk
about something else?

627
01:13:34,557 --> 01:13:35,637
Like what?

628
01:13:36,643 --> 01:13:39,312
a republican awakening by a president

629
01:13:39,437 --> 01:13:42,107
who has secluded himself
in the Élysée Palace for the weekend.

630
01:13:42,232 --> 01:13:45,565
He's cancelled everything,
doors are closed, his schedule is empty.

631
01:13:45,694 --> 01:13:49,110
All that's on his mind right now is to
prepare his appearance on France 2.

632
01:13:49,239 --> 01:13:53,188
This appearance will be in the form of
an interview conducted by David Pujadas

633
01:13:53,326 --> 01:13:59,660
because his previous interview in January
was conducted by TF1's Laurence Ferrari.

634
01:13:59,874 --> 01:14:06,605
France Inter will broadcast a special
programme tomorrow between 9 and 10 p.m.

635
01:14:06,767 --> 01:14:09,274
where we'll analyse
and comment the interview…

636
01:14:09,509 --> 01:14:13,092
... and behind the shoulder. You turn.
And behind the buttocks.

637
01:14:13,263 --> 01:14:16,927
Hold like this, with the elbow.
And we put the nappy on.

638
01:14:19,768 --> 01:14:21,560
Straighten your back.

639
01:14:22,104 --> 01:14:23,646
Straighten it.

640
01:14:24,273 --> 01:14:29,647
Then gently roll back,
straighten your leg.

641
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:37,405
Could you grap the sheet down there?
I'll help you.

642
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:39,529
Pull, pull, pull, pull.

643
01:14:39,705 --> 01:14:44,782
Now you pull the diaper.
Like this.

644
01:14:45,877 --> 01:14:47,206
That's it.

645
01:14:48,422 --> 01:14:50,461
And we lie down on the back.

646
01:14:53,552 --> 01:14:57,384
And you put the nappy on
and fasten the tapes.

647
01:16:06,624 --> 01:16:09,115
There, my love,
I hope you like it.

648
01:16:09,252 --> 01:16:10,497
Yes, yes.

649
01:16:32,316 --> 01:16:35,151
I added some peach juice.

650
01:16:35,986 --> 01:16:37,979
I find it tastes quite good.

651
01:18:02,404 --> 01:18:05,655
Come on, Anne, my love,
you've only swallowed three mouthfuls.

652
01:18:32,684 --> 01:18:33,633
I'm sorry.

653
01:19:06,009 --> 01:19:09,591
Mum to the concert...

654
01:19:13,808 --> 01:19:14,804
Yes?

655
01:19:17,395 --> 01:19:20,396
Mum to the concert...

656
01:19:24,402 --> 01:19:25,980
No... no dress...

657
01:19:28,323 --> 01:19:30,648
No dress, mum to the concert.

658
01:19:30,784 --> 01:19:33,274
Mum to the concert...

659
01:19:39,147 --> 01:19:39,697
No!

660
01:19:44,088 --> 01:19:46,544
I'll also wash the other one.

661
01:19:57,726 --> 01:19:59,884
That's it.
Now we only wash off the soap.

662
01:20:03,273 --> 01:20:05,847
Does the temperature suit you?

663
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:10,613
No? I'm bending you forward.
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

664
01:20:14,076 --> 01:20:15,451
Very well.

665
01:20:26,588 --> 01:20:31,464
... come from 8 till 12
and I'd do 2 until 6, or 3 to 7.

666
01:20:31,676 --> 01:20:33,219
I'll think about it.

667
01:20:33,345 --> 01:20:35,302
She just has to know in time
so she can plan ahead.

668
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:37,838
Of course. I'll let you know
in the next few days.

669
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:40,555
Very well.
I have to go now.

670
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:45,642
- Thanks for the coffee.
- My pleasure.

671
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:48,430
I'll see you out.

672
01:21:00,705 --> 01:21:04,655
You mustn't take it too seriously.
Usually they always say something.

673
01:21:04,876 --> 01:21:07,581
She might just as well say
"Mum, Mum, Mum".

674
01:21:07,712 --> 01:21:10,463
- It's just mechanical.
- I know.

675
01:21:18,264 --> 01:21:20,506
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

676
01:22:15,821 --> 01:22:18,656
I'd like to hire a second nurse.

677
01:22:20,034 --> 01:22:22,274
The two could take turns.

678
01:22:23,369 --> 01:22:25,243
That would make everything
a bit simpler, wouldn't it?

679
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:28,701
What do you think?

680
01:22:34,968 --> 01:22:36,135
Hurts.

681
01:22:39,408 --> 01:22:40,575
Hurts.

682
01:22:43,786 --> 01:22:44,954
Hurts.

683
01:22:46,566 --> 01:22:47,734
Hurts.

684
01:22:50,813 --> 01:22:53,600
- Please leave them in the kitchen.
- Yes.

685
01:22:55,568 --> 01:22:56,848
I'm back!

686
01:23:07,872 --> 01:23:09,035
Thank you.

687
01:23:15,713 --> 01:23:17,421
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

688
01:23:17,548 --> 01:23:19,706
No, thank you.
You've been a big help, Mr. Méry.

689
01:23:19,842 --> 01:23:22,000
It's nothing, sir.
Thanks a lot, sir.

690
01:23:22,386 --> 01:23:24,343
I'll let you know
if I need you again.

691
01:23:24,472 --> 01:23:26,132
With pleasure, sir.

692
01:23:27,016 --> 01:23:28,012
Goodbye.

693
01:23:31,437 --> 01:23:34,474
- May I say something, sir?
- Yes?

694
01:23:34,815 --> 01:23:40,189
My wife and I, we are very impressed
by your handling of the situation.

695
01:23:40,988 --> 01:23:42,233
I take my hat off to you.

696
01:23:42,698 --> 01:23:44,275
That's very kind of you.
Thank you.

697
01:23:47,411 --> 01:23:48,905
Until next time.

698
01:23:49,037 --> 01:23:51,992
- Give my regards to your wife.
- I certainly will.

699
01:23:57,796 --> 01:24:00,084
Hello Eva.
How are you?

700
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:08,090
Things are fine.

701
01:24:11,393 --> 01:24:12,673
On...

702
01:24:17,734 --> 01:24:18,901
the...

703
01:24:20,619 --> 01:24:21,787
b...

704
01:24:22,195 --> 01:24:23,737
On the bridge...

705
01:24:23,905 --> 01:24:26,443
bridge of A...

706
01:24:26,699 --> 01:24:28,443
of Avignon...

707
01:24:30,453 --> 01:24:33,620
On the bridge of Avignon...

708
01:24:33,957 --> 01:24:35,581
the... the...

709
01:24:35,708 --> 01:24:37,915
- Come on, Anne.
- The bridge!

710
01:24:41,589 --> 01:24:42,669
of Avignon...

711
01:24:42,799 --> 01:24:46,927
vi...vi...vignon...gnon

712
01:24:47,053 --> 01:24:49,722
On the bridge of Avignon

713
01:24:50,264 --> 01:24:52,304
we all dance there,
we all dance there

714
01:24:52,433 --> 01:24:55,268
- Dance!
- On the bridge of Avignon...

715
01:24:55,394 --> 01:24:58,181
- Dance!
- We all dance...

716
01:24:59,148 --> 01:25:01,935
- all... all...
- On the bridge of Avignon

717
01:25:02,109 --> 01:25:04,731
we all dance there,
we all dance there

718
01:25:04,904 --> 01:25:08,071
On the bridge of Avignon

719
01:25:08,449 --> 01:25:10,241
we all dance there in a ring

720
01:25:10,410 --> 01:25:12,485
On the bridge...

721
01:25:13,245 --> 01:25:15,617
dance... dance...

722
01:25:16,373 --> 01:25:18,449
all... all...

723
01:25:23,464 --> 01:25:24,744
There we are.

724
01:25:30,513 --> 01:25:33,300
Now you're all beautiful again.

725
01:25:34,141 --> 01:25:36,300
So everyone will admire you.

726
01:25:37,143 --> 01:25:38,223
That's it.

727
01:25:40,230 --> 01:25:42,555
You want to see?
Wait.

728
01:25:45,944 --> 01:25:47,272
Well?

729
01:25:48,488 --> 01:25:50,066
Aren't we a pretty sight?

730
01:26:35,201 --> 01:26:36,150
Shoo!

731
01:26:47,255 --> 01:26:48,334
Shoo!

732
01:26:55,971 --> 01:26:57,513
Shoo!

733
01:27:03,687 --> 01:27:05,431
As you wish, sir.

734
01:27:07,817 --> 01:27:10,486
I don't know
what you were expecting, but..

735
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:13,773
I gave up another job
to come and work here.

736
01:27:14,281 --> 01:27:18,029
You should've thought it over before
if you'll need a second nurse or not.

737
01:27:18,285 --> 01:27:21,950
I didn't know then
how incompetent you are.

738
01:27:22,748 --> 01:27:23,946
What's that supposed to mean?

739
01:27:24,082 --> 01:27:27,748
I don't want to discuss it with you.
Anyway, you wouldn't understand.

740
01:27:28,295 --> 01:27:30,252
No one has ever reprimanded me.

741
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:33,216
Good for you.
How much do I owe you?

742
01:27:36,679 --> 01:27:37,793
780 euro.

743
01:27:40,598 --> 01:27:43,172
I've never had anything like this
happen to me before.

744
01:27:44,477 --> 01:27:48,142
Who do you think you are?
I've been doing this job for years.

745
01:27:48,273 --> 01:27:50,515
I don't need you
to teach me how to do it.

746
01:27:50,650 --> 01:27:51,516
Do you have 20 euro?

747
01:28:00,285 --> 01:28:03,202
- No.
- Then take the 800 and go.

748
01:28:09,127 --> 01:28:11,333
You're a wicked old man.

749
01:28:12,755 --> 01:28:14,036
I feel sorry for you.

750
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,060
I hope from the bottom of my heart

751
01:28:17,283 --> 01:28:20,242
that one day someone treats you
the same way you treat your patients,

752
01:28:21,264 --> 01:28:24,016
and that you too will have no way
of defending yourself.

753
01:28:24,184 --> 01:28:25,761
Now get out.

754
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,054
Get out of here.

755
01:28:31,315 --> 01:28:33,806
Go fuck yourself, you old fart!

756
01:29:16,901 --> 01:29:19,108
Open your mouth, Anne.

757
01:29:20,447 --> 01:29:23,317
Come on, open your mouth.

758
01:29:26,703 --> 01:29:30,155
Anne! Please.

759
01:29:35,212 --> 01:29:36,291
Come on.

760
01:29:38,966 --> 01:29:40,163
Please.

761
01:29:44,595 --> 01:29:46,006
Stop it.

762
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:48,596
If you don't drink, you'll die.

763
01:29:50,226 --> 01:29:51,056
Is that what you want?

764
01:29:56,941 --> 01:29:59,349
Come on.
Please.

765
01:30:09,078 --> 01:30:10,869
Christ almighty.

766
01:30:15,376 --> 01:30:18,247
You can't force me
to let you die of thirst.

767
01:30:19,088 --> 01:30:22,753
If you persist, I'll call Bertier
and he'll put you in hospital.

768
01:30:24,385 --> 01:30:28,382
They can force-feed you there.
Is that what you want?

769
01:30:31,767 --> 01:30:34,887
I promised to spare you that
but you must help me.

770
01:30:37,022 --> 01:30:38,682
I'm out of my depth.

771
01:30:41,986 --> 01:30:43,266
Come on, Anne.

772
01:30:51,871 --> 01:30:53,578
Drink this, now!

773
01:30:59,252 --> 01:31:01,922
That's it.
Good.

774
01:31:05,092 --> 01:31:06,372
Well, swallow it!

775
01:31:37,916 --> 01:31:39,244
Please, forgive me.

776
01:31:41,335 --> 01:31:42,414
I'm sorry.

777
01:32:56,743 --> 01:32:58,237
- Who's there?
- It's me.

778
01:32:58,578 --> 01:33:00,238
- Eva?
- Yes.

779
01:33:02,582 --> 01:33:04,076
Just a minute.

780
01:33:56,219 --> 01:33:57,879
- Hello.
- Hello.

781
01:33:59,555 --> 01:34:00,718
What was going on?

782
01:34:01,224 --> 01:34:03,133
Nothing.
I was in the toilet.

783
01:34:04,852 --> 01:34:06,181
No, come in.

784
01:34:17,573 --> 01:34:21,072
- Why this unannounced visit?
- What's going on with mum?

785
01:34:21,535 --> 01:34:24,702
Nothing.
What should be going on?

786
01:34:28,250 --> 01:34:30,077
Don't you want to sit down first?

787
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:38,759
Why are you in Paris?

788
01:34:38,927 --> 01:34:42,759
What's going on with mum?
Why don't you answer the phone?

789
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:46,348
Since our last conversation, I left
four messages on your answering machine.

790
01:34:46,557 --> 01:34:48,454
Why don't you call back?

791
01:34:49,187 --> 01:34:52,105
Sorry. I didn't listen to it.
Forgive me.

792
01:34:52,232 --> 01:34:54,521
Don't you realize we're worried?

793
01:34:56,694 --> 01:34:59,102
Your worries are no use to me.

794
01:34:59,656 --> 01:35:03,784
No, don't get me wrong.
I'm not criticizing you.

795
01:35:04,953 --> 01:35:07,954
I just don't have the time
to deal with your worries, that's all.

796
01:35:08,081 --> 01:35:11,580
- Dad...
- No, let's stop this conversation.

797
01:35:12,752 --> 01:35:16,881
Your mother is just as could have been
expected: bad the whole time.

798
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:22,047
She is turning more and more
into a helpless child.

799
01:35:22,511 --> 01:35:25,548
It's sad and humiliating
for her and for me.

800
01:35:25,681 --> 01:35:28,433
And she doesn't want
to be seen in that state.

801
01:35:28,559 --> 01:35:32,509
Even the last time
she did not want you to come.

802
01:35:33,189 --> 01:35:34,786
You two have your own life.
Nothing wrong with that.

803
01:35:34,995 --> 01:35:36,993
But let us have our life too.
Okay?

804
01:35:37,318 --> 01:35:39,560
Dad, what's the matter?

805
01:35:40,405 --> 01:35:43,690
Nothing.
Your visit caught me by surprise.

806
01:35:43,867 --> 01:35:48,693
And I'm annoyed that you show up here
to check that everything's okay.

807
01:35:49,288 --> 01:35:51,530
Who do you think you are?

808
01:35:57,254 --> 01:35:59,413
Stay here, please.

809
01:36:02,218 --> 01:36:03,416
Please!

810
01:36:15,063 --> 01:36:16,059
Mum?

811
01:36:20,193 --> 01:36:21,142
Mum!

812
01:36:30,079 --> 01:36:31,870
Tell me, what's going on?
Have you gone crazy?

813
01:36:31,997 --> 01:36:32,697
Sit down.

814
01:36:32,831 --> 01:36:35,618
I don't want to sit down.
What's going on here?

815
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:39,499
Nothing's going on. I want to spare
us all a pointless drama.

816
01:36:40,130 --> 01:36:43,084
I presume your mother is asleep.
She sleeps all day.

817
01:36:43,550 --> 01:36:45,922
And then she wakes up at night.

818
01:36:47,262 --> 01:36:49,800
If you really want to,
we'll go and see her in a little while.

819
01:36:51,183 --> 01:36:52,677
Now, sit down.

820
01:37:06,781 --> 01:37:12,642
We do our speech exercises every day,
or we sing together.

821
01:37:14,497 --> 01:37:19,788
Usually I wake up around 5.
At that time, she's still awake.

822
01:37:20,295 --> 01:37:25,170
We change the nappy,
I rub cream on her to avoid bed sores.

823
01:37:26,258 --> 01:37:31,335
Then, around 7, I try to persuade her
to eat and drink.

824
01:37:32,723 --> 01:37:35,049
Sometimes it works, sometimes not.

825
01:37:35,559 --> 01:37:38,763
Sometimes she tells me things
from her childhood.

826
01:37:38,938 --> 01:37:41,476
Or calls for help for hours.

827
01:37:42,942 --> 01:37:46,275
Then, suddenly, she starts giggling.

828
01:37:47,487 --> 01:37:48,982
Or crying.

829
01:37:53,035 --> 01:37:55,905
Nothing of any of that
is worth showing.

830
01:38:00,542 --> 01:38:03,034
You can't forbid me
from seeing her.

831
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:07,205
No.

832
01:39:10,319 --> 01:39:11,695
It's me, Mum.

833
01:39:27,169 --> 01:39:29,494
Can I do something for you?

834
01:39:40,182 --> 01:39:41,297
Mum.

835
01:39:42,977 --> 01:39:44,305
Mum.

836
01:39:44,854 --> 01:39:46,265
Mum.

837
01:39:49,274 --> 01:39:50,437
Mum.

838
01:40:58,885 --> 01:41:00,000
The tea isn't very hot any more.

839
01:41:04,473 --> 01:41:05,967
But it does make you feel better.

840
01:41:17,862 --> 01:41:18,893
Thanks.

841
01:41:34,378 --> 01:41:37,047
It was silly of me
to lock the door.

842
01:41:37,506 --> 01:41:38,751
I'm sorry.

843
01:41:39,425 --> 01:41:41,133
You took me by surprise.

844
01:41:43,304 --> 01:41:44,798
I'm sorry.

845
01:41:46,557 --> 01:41:48,016
What's going to happen now?

846
01:41:50,310 --> 01:41:51,804
What's going to happen now?

847
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:57,228
The nurse comes
three times a week.

848
01:41:57,359 --> 01:42:00,941
Every two weeks Dr. Bertier
and the hairdresser come.

849
01:42:01,738 --> 01:42:04,063
That's what you wanted to know?
No?

850
01:42:06,368 --> 01:42:09,203
Things will go on
as they have done up until now.

851
01:42:10,789 --> 01:42:12,126
They'll go from bad to worse.

852
01:42:12,334 --> 01:42:14,521
Things will go on,
and then one day it will all be over.

853
01:42:16,627 --> 01:42:18,585
You can't go on like this, Dad.

854
01:42:18,713 --> 01:42:19,911
- No?
- No.

855
01:42:20,882 --> 01:42:22,459
What do you suggest?

856
01:42:23,176 --> 01:42:25,334
Can't we have a serious talk,
you and me?

857
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:28,973
What do you call "a serious talk"?

858
01:42:30,016 --> 01:42:32,258
Do you want to have Mom live with you?

859
01:42:33,019 --> 01:42:35,193
Do you want to pack her off
to a care home?

860
01:42:35,402 --> 01:42:37,233
Is this what you want?

861
01:42:38,691 --> 01:42:42,190
Go on, talk to me seriously!

862
01:42:46,490 --> 01:42:48,234
All long...

863
01:42:49,452 --> 01:42:51,076
Ding dong...

864
01:42:54,832 --> 01:42:57,454
Yes, it swung to and fro.

865
01:42:57,585 --> 01:43:00,788
Yes, yes, to, fro.

866
01:43:01,089 --> 01:43:02,167
You...

867
01:43:03,882 --> 01:43:05,460
Very serious...

868
01:43:05,676 --> 01:43:06,956
Like that.

869
01:43:07,261 --> 01:43:08,292
Yes.

870
01:43:09,346 --> 01:43:10,425
Like that.

871
01:43:12,057 --> 01:43:13,172
Serious.

872
01:43:14,184 --> 01:43:16,343
Yes, I was very uptight.

873
01:43:16,812 --> 01:43:18,093
Yes.

874
01:43:19,190 --> 01:43:20,684
Up...tight.

875
01:43:25,154 --> 01:43:29,898
It... was... nice.

876
01:43:46,884 --> 01:43:48,461
Hurts.

877
01:43:52,430 --> 01:43:54,257
Hurts.

878
01:43:57,965 --> 01:43:58,820
Hurts.

879
01:44:11,116 --> 01:44:14,319
What's the matter.
Where do you hurt?

880
01:44:19,540 --> 01:44:20,951
What's going on?

881
01:44:21,959 --> 01:44:23,288
Is it the nappy?

882
01:44:24,086 --> 01:44:25,367
Is it full?

883
01:44:28,549 --> 01:44:29,960
Where do you hurt?

884
01:44:36,266 --> 01:44:40,179
It's all right, it's all right.
I'm here.

885
01:44:44,690 --> 01:44:45,970
Everything's fine.

886
01:44:50,696 --> 01:44:51,941
We will...

887
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:55,524
Do you want me
to tell you a story?

888
01:44:57,787 --> 01:45:00,871
But you must be quiet,
I can't talk too loud.

889
01:45:02,375 --> 01:45:03,998
It wears me out.

890
01:45:08,296 --> 01:45:10,455
When I was little,

891
01:45:10,882 --> 01:45:13,883
well, I wasn't as little as all that,

892
01:45:14,344 --> 01:45:19,220
I think it was
toward the end of primary school,

893
01:45:19,558 --> 01:45:21,883
so I was about 10.

894
01:45:23,854 --> 01:45:27,852
Dad and mum had sent me
to a holiday camp.

895
01:45:28,274 --> 01:45:33,150
They thought it would do me good to
spend the summer with kids my own age.

896
01:45:34,531 --> 01:45:37,448
We were lodged in an old castle

897
01:45:40,161 --> 01:45:43,365
in the midst of the forest.
I think it was in the Auvergne.

898
01:45:44,458 --> 01:45:45,916
I don't remember.

899
01:45:46,835 --> 01:45:51,082
In any case it was the opposite
of what I'd expected.

900
01:45:54,342 --> 01:45:58,885
We had to get up at 6 in the morning
and plunge into a lake.

901
01:45:59,222 --> 01:46:02,342
It was a small lake
not far from the castle.

902
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:06,680
It was fed by an icy mountain stream.

903
01:46:07,605 --> 01:46:11,437
We had to enter it running,
in a double file.

904
01:46:13,570 --> 01:46:16,605
You know,
I was never very sporty.

905
01:46:18,115 --> 01:46:25,432
They had worked out a programme
to keep us on the go all day,

906
01:46:27,750 --> 01:46:34,369
Probably to nip in... in the bud

907
01:46:35,049 --> 01:46:38,086
any potential pubescent impulses.

908
01:46:39,053 --> 01:46:41,211
But the worst thing was the food.

909
01:46:43,098 --> 01:46:49,183
The third day after our arrival,
there was rice pudding for lunch.

910
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:51,389
I hate rice pudding.

911
01:46:51,982 --> 01:46:58,186
We sat at long tables in a huge hall.

912
01:46:58,697 --> 01:47:00,939
I didn't want to eat the stuff.

913
01:47:03,869 --> 01:47:07,033
One of the monitors said to me:

914
01:47:07,737 --> 01:47:11,996
"If you don't clear your plate,
you won't get out of here."

915
01:47:13,879 --> 01:47:17,212
So after the meal everybody left,

916
01:47:17,716 --> 01:47:20,883
and I remained alone, in tears.

917
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:27,725
I had made a secret pact with mum.

918
01:47:28,185 --> 01:47:33,605
I was to write to her every week.
I was to send her a postcard.

919
01:47:33,856 --> 01:47:39,729
If I liked the stay,
I was to draw flowers,

920
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:42,735
if not, stars.

921
01:47:43,742 --> 01:47:49,080
She kept the card.
It was covered all over in stars.

922
01:47:51,458 --> 01:47:55,205
After three hours,
I was finally allowed to get out.

923
01:47:56,837 --> 01:48:00,503
I went up to my room,
got into bed

924
01:48:01,342 --> 01:48:03,667
I had a fever of over 40 degrees.

925
01:48:04,428 --> 01:48:05,923
It was diphtheria.

926
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:11,967
I was taken
to the nearest hospital

927
01:48:12,478 --> 01:48:14,685
and sent to quarantine.

928
01:48:15,523 --> 01:48:18,772
Which meant that mum,
when she came to visit me,

929
01:48:19,443 --> 01:48:22,693
could only wave at me
through a window.

930
01:48:27,952 --> 01:48:30,359
At some point I lost that postcard.

931
01:48:32,414 --> 01:48:33,743
It's a pity.

932
01:59:29,603 --> 01:59:32,806
... you won't believe it.
A pigeon came in,

933
01:59:32,940 --> 01:59:36,356
for the second time already,
through the light well.

934
01:59:36,485 --> 01:59:40,897
This time I caught it.
In fact it wasn't difficult at all.

935
01:59:41,030 --> 01:59:43,356
But I set it free again.

936
02:01:38,814 --> 02:01:40,522
I'm almost done.

937
02:01:44,819 --> 02:01:46,812
You can put your shoes on if you want.

938
02:02:56,515 --> 02:02:57,713
Thank you.

939
02:03:05,649 --> 02:03:07,476
Aren't you taking a coat?
