What was that?

15
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,318
Yes? Southern Sea Salvage,
Ogata speaking.

16
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,858
What?

17
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:28,300
Right, I understand.
As soon as possible.

18
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,713
Emiko, I'm sorry...

19
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,943
What is it? An accident?

20
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,412
The Coast Guard received
a distress call.

21
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,422
I'll have to cancel
our date tonight.

22
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:51,991
I'm sorry I can't go with you,

23
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:53,759
but you can still see it
if you hurry.

24
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,664
It's a shame, but it's your job.

25
00:03:58,705 --> 00:03:59,763
Well, you'd better hurry.

26
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:13,513
Southern Sea Steamship Company
vessel, the "Eiko-maru,"

27
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:16,954
a 7,500-ton freighter,
was reported lost...

28
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,581
on August 13 at 19:05 hours.

29
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,116
Its last position,
latitude 24 degrees north,

30
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,889
longitude 141.02 degrees east.

31
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,228
Contact was lost
for unknown reasons.

32
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,963
All units in sectors 3 and 4
stand by for action!

33
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,031
Thank you for calling me.

34
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,807
Thank you again.
What could have happened?

35
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:41,971
We have no idea.

36
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,984
It seems like there was
a sudden explosion.

37
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,315
Communications suddenly halted

38
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,047
shortly after we received
their SOS.

39
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:52,119
Well, the "Bingo-maru" is
approaching the area now.

40
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,853
We'll learn more soon enough.

41
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,957
They are here.

42
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,958
Certainly. The "Eiko-maru" and
"Bingo-maru" are both owned

43
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,519
by the Southern Sea
Steamship Company.

44
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:33,589
Yes. They don't know how.

45
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:37,501
Can't you tell us
if any survivors were seen?

46
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,437
Please wait a little longer.

47
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:43,602
We have a helicopter and two
ships searching the area now.

48
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:48,307
We won't be sure of anything
until we get their report.

49
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,816
Excuse me,
why not send more ships?

50
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,410
Two ships are not enough
for this!

51
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,479
No, we're not limiting
the search party to two ships.

52
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,956
We'll make every effort
to conduct a thorough search.

53
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,424
Until then, please be patient.

54
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,633
Hey!

55
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,466
Help us, please!

56
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,373
We're here! Hang in there!

57
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,805
It was incredible.

58
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,540
The ocean just blew up!

59
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,604
Blew up?

60
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,585
So far, three survivors were
picked up by a fishing boat.

61
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:33,183
They are being taken
to Odo Island.

62
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,662
We have sent the vessel "Kotaka"
to assist them.

63
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,687
Which ship
were the survivors from...

64
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,596
the "Eiko-maru"
or the "Bingo-maru"?

65
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:41,793
We are still investigating,

66
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,802
but their names will be released
soon enough.

67
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:49,206
I hope the three men know
what happened.

68
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,302
We need to know more
about the accidents.

69
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,611
Just a moment! Please, wait!

70
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,384
What's the matter?

71
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,693
I can't believe it.

72
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,427
I just can't believe it!

73
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:19,465
The fishing boat sank
the same way.

74
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,302
News desk! Ah, Mr. Yamana?

75
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,776
Mr. Yamana, the other search
boat was sunk!

76
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,745
In the same area... yes.

77
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,508
Yes, in the same way!

78
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,106
We're tired of hearing
the same thing!

79
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:31,411
Please tell us what happened!

80
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,510
Please give us a chance
to investigate!

81
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:34,952
Don't you know what's going on?

82
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,488
I'm sorry,
but you must be patient!

83
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:37,580
Wait, please wait!

84
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,927
A drifting sea mine, or an
underwater volcanic eruption?

85
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,865
One shipwreck after another!

86
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:18,625
I can't imagine,
could it be a volcano?

87
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,364
Izuma! Is there something
out there?

88
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:29,070
Ah, it's a raft!

89
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:32,134
Hey, there's a raft out there!

90
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,646
A raft is coming this way!

91
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,807
A raft is coming!

92
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,818
Hey! Over here!

93
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,693
Build up the fire!
Build up the fire!

94
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:10,241
It's Masaji! It's Masaji!

95
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:16,344
Masaji!

96
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,924
Masaji! Hold on! Masaji!

97
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,015
Hang on!

98
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,701
Brother!

99
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,501
Masaji! Masaji!

100
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,564
Masaji!

101
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,713
He did it...

102
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,941
What?!

103
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,277
A monster...

104
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:48,310
What did this?!
Masaji! What did this?!

105
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,417
It's no good!
We didn't catch anything!

106
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,589
It can't get any worse
than this!

107
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:10,575
Then...
Godzilla must have done it.

108
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,478
The old man and Godzilla,
both relics from days past!

109
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:20,978
Hey! What do you know
about the old days?!

110
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,248
If you all keep thinking
like that,

111
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,587
you'll all become prey
for Godzilla!

112
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:53,952
Anyhow, there must be
some kind of animal in the sea.

113
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,546
That's why
we can't catch anything.

114
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,557
But a creature that big would...

115
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,889
I knew it was stupid
to open my mouth!

116
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:03,861
I try to tell you all,
but nobody listens!

117
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,523
Shinkichi, let's go.

118
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:08,055
Ah, sir! Sir, sir!

119
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,248
Godzilla?

120
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:26,979
It's the name of a monster
that lives in the sea.

121
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:34,983
It will come from the ocean
to feed on humankind to survive.

122
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,986
In the old days, during times
when the fishing was poor,

123
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,990
we used to sacrifice girls

124
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:48,974
to prevent him
from eating us all, yes!

125
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,670
Now, this exorcism ceremony

126
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:56,978
is all that remains
of the old traditions.

127
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,881
Godzilla?

128
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,280
Shinkichi!

129
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,282
Shinkichi! Stay inside!

130
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,074
Shinkichi!

131
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,178
Shinkichi!

132
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,253
Brother!

133
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:40,114
Brother! Run, brother!
Brother! Run, brother!

134
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,985
Hey, hey!
Shinkichi, what's wrong?!

135
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,044
Brother!

136
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,334
Odo Island Representatives

137
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,390
Mr. Ooyama.

138
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:57,088
There have been 17 houses
destroyed with nine deaths...

139
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,620
I have heard that there
were other damages.

140
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:02,156
Could you please tell us
how bad they are?

141
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,864
Odo Island Village Mayor,
Mr. Inada.

142
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:11,969
Certainly, of course.
Twelve cows and eight pigs died.

143
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,277
I'm not lying!

144
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:19,045
It was hard to see in the dark,
but it was an animal!

145
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:23,421
I know it goes
against common sense,

146
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:26,424
but the more I think about it,
the more I am convinced

147
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,949
that it was definitely not
a normal hurricane.

148
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:32,690
The way the houses
and helicopter were destroyed,

149
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:36,030
it seems as if they were crushed
from above!

150
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,204
Now, finally,
we will hear the opinion

151
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:44,141
of expert paleontologist
Professor Kyohei Yamane.

152
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:56,977
I suppose my opinion
is a bit premature

153
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:01,355
before a thorough investigation,

154
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:08,458
but we are all aware of
the discovery in the Himalayas

155
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,164
of the alleged
"snowman footprints."

156
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:17,141
It is a mystery
we have yet to solve.

157
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:23,308
The earth has many deep pockets,
abyssal regions

158
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:29,151
that contain secrets
we have yet to discover.

159
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,850
For this incident,
I request the formation

160
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,087
of a fact-finding party
for a full investigation.

161
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,161
Good Luck,
Odo Island Research Party!

162
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,111
Good-bye!

163
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,378
We'll see you soon!

164
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:16,324
It was surprising to see
Dr. Serizawa at our departure.

165
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,496
He rarely leaves his laboratory.

166
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,200
I don't know if he believes
this will be our final journey.

167
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,607
Well, what could go wrong?

168
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,286
Of course, we can avoid
dangerous waters,

169
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:39,290
but anything can happen.

170
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:37,882
For the time being,

171
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,577
please don't use the water
from this well.

172
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,607
It's dangerous.

173
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,614
This is horrible!

174
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:46,453
We can't use the well anymore?

175
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:49,461
Professor, if there was
radioactive fallout,

176
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:53,864
wouldn't the wells on the other
side of the island be affected?

177
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,299
Yes. Why is it that the wells

178
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:59,736
in this area
were the only ones affected?

179
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,432
It doesn't make any sense.

180
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,322
Mr. Hagiwara, I think

181
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:23,226
this depression might be
the footprint of a creature.

182
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,127
Would you agree with me?

183
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,291
Is that true, Professor?

184
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,151
This footprint is radioactive.

185
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,253
Everybody, it's very dangerous
here! Please step back!

186
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,389
Step back! Step back!

187
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,545
Emiko, look!

188
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,979
It's a trilobite!

189
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,381
A three-lobed creature that has
long since been extinct!

190
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,579
Professor!
You shouldn't be touching that!

191
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,387
Professor, what is that thing?

192
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:31,828
This is...
an incredible discovery!

193
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,212
It's on the other side
of the hill!

194
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,216
It's on the other
side of the hill!

195
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,636
Father!

196
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,608
What is it?

197
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:23,706
Tanabe, I saw it!

198
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,683
A creature
from the Jurassic Period!

199
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,480
Where is it?

200
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,797
Emiko! Emiko!

201
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,371
Emiko!

202
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,272
Father!

203
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,007
This way! This way!

204
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,452
This way! This way!

205
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:46,531
What is that?

206
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:47,554
Those are footprints.

207
00:22:56,441 --> 00:23:02,710
About 2 million years ago,
this brontosaurus

208
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:08,744
and these other dinosaurs
roamed the earth

209
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:12,951
during a period
the experts called Jurassic.

210
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:15,653
During the following
geological period,

211
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,423
the Cretaceous,

212
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:21,694
a creature somewhere between
the marine reptiles

213
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,829
and the evolving
terrestrial animals was born.

214
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:30,808
I am convinced there was such
an intermediate creature.

215
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:40,780
This creature, according
to Odo Island folklore,

216
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,287
is called Godzilla.

217
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:49,753
As we look at this photo
of Godzilla's head

218
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:52,525
from a hill on Odo Island,

219
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:55,965
we can estimate
that this creature

220
00:23:56,001 --> 00:24:00,131
stands approximately
50 meters tall.

221
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,538
So then, how can we explain

222
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:07,841
the presence of such a creature
during the present day?

223
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:10,143
It probably survived

224
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:17,111
by eating deep sea organisms
occupying a specific niche.

225
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:20,955
However, recent experimental
nuclear detonations

226
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:25,052
may have drastically altered
its natural habitat.

227
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:29,123
I would even speculate
that a hydrogen bomb explosion

228
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:32,796
may have removed it
from its surroundings.

229
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:35,065
Incredible!

230
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:36,130
Really!

231
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:40,170
I have strong evidence
to support my theory.

232
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,642
First, the organism
we found embedded

233
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,445
in Godzilla's footprint,
a trilobite.

234
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,453
This is a photo of the creature.

235
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,579
This is it.

236
00:24:56,561 --> 00:25:00,497
This creature has been extinct
for two million years,

237
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:03,899
yet here it is
in perfect physical condition.

238
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,731
Next is the sediment

239
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,834
that we found
in the trilobite's shell.

240
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,641
That sediment is sand.

241
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,614
There is no doubt that this sand

242
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:22,416
matches the deposits found
from the Jurassic period.

243
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,217
This sand is similar
to the red clay

244
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,588
found in the stratum
of that particular period.

245
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,956
Professor, how do you know

246
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,689
that this has something to do
with the atomic bombs?

247
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,857
Because
our Geiger counter readings

248
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,595
of the radiation in this sand

249
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:40,071
indicate the presence
of Strontium-90.

250
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:45,668
Professor Tanabiya will explain
this better in a moment,

251
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:50,511
but basically, this sand
that came from Godzilla

252
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,382
has absorbed
a massive dose of radiation,

253
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:56,512
the type generated
only from an atomic bomb.

254
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:03,826
Order, please! Order, please!

255
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:16,266
The evidence suggests
that Godzilla itself

256
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:22,872
must have absorbed an enormous
amount of atomic radiation.

257
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:31,580
Order, please! Order, please!

258
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,090
Chairman! Chairman!

259
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,960
Mr. Ooyama.

260
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,757
I believe
Professor Yamane's report

261
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:43,461
is of such extreme importance,
it must not be made public.

262
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:47,134
What are you saying?!

263
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:48,730
Because it is so important,
it should be made public!

264
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:49,762
Yes! Yes!

265
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:54,543
Be quiet!

266
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:57,810
What I mean is, if this Godzilla

267
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:02,684
is the product from the use
of atomic weapons...

268
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,655
Exactly!
That's exactly what it is!

269
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:05,747
She's right!

270
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:07,918
That's my point!

271
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:10,187
World affairs are fragile enough
as it is!

272
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:11,889
If this were to be made public,

273
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,625
can you imagine
the consequences?

274
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:14,757
The truth is the truth!

275
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,767
That is what makes it
such a delicate matter!

276
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:21,228
The improper handling
of such a notion

277
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:24,139
would engulf the country
in a panic!

278
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:27,269
The government, the economy
and international relations

279
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,939
would plunge into total chaos!

280
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,140
You stupid idiot!
What are you saying?!

281
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:32,206
You dare to call me an idiot?!

282
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,877
Apologize! Apologize!

283
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:35,715
The truth must be made public!

284
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:47,796
Counter-Godzilla Headquarters
Established.

285
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:52,235
Seventeen Ships Already Lost.

286
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,362
It's terrible, huh?

287
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,305
Contaminated tuna
and radioactive fallout,

288
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,604
and now this Godzilla
to top it all off!

289
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,236
What will happen if he appears
out of Tokyo Bay?

290
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:04,078
First, he'll probably eat you
in one bite.

291
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:05,412
You're horrible!

292
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,214
They seemed certain about
the accuracy of their report.

293
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,880
How could we create
such a thing?

294
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:12,446
I guess I'll have to find
a shelter soon.

295
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,185
Find one for me, too!

296
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:18,161
The shelters again?
That stinks.

297
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:24,926
Counter-Godzilla Headquarters

298
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:29,030
Isn't there any way they can get
rid of this creature?

299
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,682
Longitude 138
to 138.07 degrees east.

300
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:47,749
Latitude 33.04
to 33.08 degrees north.

301
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:52,491
These are the coordinates of
the anti-Godzilla frigate fleet.

302
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,761
Depth charges will be dropped
in the area.

303
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:01,136
So vessels in the vicinity
should be warned.

304
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:03,640
That's all.

305
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:04,642
Is that all?

306
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:05,665
That's all.

307
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,186
In response
to the public outcry,

308
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:58,127
the government is attempting

309
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:01,621
to get rid of the monster
known as Godzilla.

310
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:02,963
A frigate fleet has been ordered

311
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:04,626
to begin
a massive depth-charge attack

312
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:06,159
in order to get rid
of the creature.

313
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:09,867
The 10 vessel fleet left port
at 10:00 a.m.,

314
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:12,968
heading for the coast
of Odo Island.

315
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:14,102
At 10:19 a.m.,

316
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,306
they received orders
to commence with their attack.

317
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:28,055
What's wrong with them?

318
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,523
The professor is a zoologist.

319
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,793
He doesn't want them
to kill Godzilla.

320
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:38,396
Father! Father!

321
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,739
Father...

322
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:57,985
Please leave me alone
for a while.

323
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,987
Emiko, please turn off
the light.

324
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:08,254
Yes.

325
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,756
Godzilla! It's Godzilla!

326
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:22,229
Watch out! Watch out!
Please don't panic!

327
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,718
What a bother!

328
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,345
Have you tried solving
the problem together?

329
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,253
They're sticking
to their point of view.

330
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,656
How much longer will they
keep us waiting like this?

331
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,661
For as long as they want.

332
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,754
It's annoying!

333
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,130
Please, Professor. Have a seat.

334
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,157
Excuse me.

335
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:53,962
Thank you for coming.

336
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,029
You're welcome.

337
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,769
This is quite a problem,
Professor.

338
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,772
If this keeps up,

339
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,807
we'll have to suspend
the international ship routes.

340
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,642
Have you found a way?

341
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:12,815
Is there something we can do
to defeat him?

342
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,950
So, that's it?

343
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:20,457
Professor Yamane,
let's be honest.

344
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:24,992
If there's a way to defeat
Godzilla, we'd like to know.

345
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:27,860
It's impossible!

346
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:33,505
He absorbed massive amounts
of atomic radiation,

347
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:35,444
but Godzilla still survived.

348
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,243
What do you think
could kill him?

349
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:46,313
Instead, we should focus
on why he is still alive.

350
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,349
That should be our top priority!

351
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,198
Professor Yamane's argument
is absolutely correct!

352
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:06,801
This isn't the time
to behave like idiots.

353
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:08,334
We should focus
on scientific research!

354
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,347
Yes, but research at what cost?

355
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,849
You're right!
That's the question!

356
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,786
Hagiwara, interview
this gentleman.

357
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,123
Dr. Serizawa?

358
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:24,959
Yes, he's Professor Yamane's
future son-in-law.

359
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:28,021
Oh? The girl's fiance?

360
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:32,029
I'm sure my father
will understand.

361
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:38,375
There's no reason
for him to apologize.

362
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,640
But I can't help feeling uneasy
when I think about Serizawa.

363
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:46,976
If it wasn't for the war,

364
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:50,179
he wouldn't have received
such a terrible scar.

365
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,347
Ogata...

366
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,950
Ever since I was a child,

367
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:59,895
I've always thought of him
as an older brother.

368
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,799
Even now, my feelings for him
have not changed at all.

369
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,262
Emiko, thanks.

370
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,814
Miss, Mr. Hagiwara would like
to see you.

371
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,943
Mr. Hagiwara?

372
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:21,974
Yes, the reporter.

373
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,682
Hello! Excuse me.

374
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:26,417
Thank you.

375
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:29,751
What do you want?

376
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,228
Um... I'd like
to ask you a favor.

377
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,959
The truth is, I tried
to talk to Dr. Serizawa,

378
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,624
but he refused to see me.

379
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:39,795
So, I was wondering if you could
introduce me to him?

380
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:42,169
It's for our daily newspaper.

381
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:44,834
I'm sorry, but I need your help.

382
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,541
It's perfect.

383
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:53,983
I should go along with you to
speak with Serizawa personally.

384
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:59,421
You're right, but I should break
it to him my way.

385
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:03,860
Please let me go
to speak with him first.

386
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:08,889
You're right. Well, go ahead.

387
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,060
Thank you. I'm sorry,
but we should go.

388
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,865
I have a ride waiting outside.

389
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,973
I'll try my best to talk to him.

390
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:30,820
I'll help Shinkichi
with his studies. See you later.

391
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:03,711
Serizawa Research Laboratory

392
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:07,315
There must be some mistake.

393
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,053
I haven't spoken to anyone

394
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,425
about the importance
of my research.

395
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:13,930
It's the truth.
A journalist in Switzerland

396
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:17,264
met with a German scientist
who stated that your project

397
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:20,202
would be
an incredible breakthrough

398
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:24,607
in anti-Godzilla operations
in Japan when completed.

399
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:28,100
I don't have any German
scientist associates.

400
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:33,082
Really? Then what is the nature
of your research right now?

401
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:36,109
No. I'd rather not speak
about it.

402
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,750
Well, thank you for your time.

403
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:46,092
No, I'm sorry
that I wasn't much help.

404
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:46,789
Excuse me.

405
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,400
I'll stay a little longer.

406
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,595
Really? Then, I'll be going.

407
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:19,218
I wanted to find out
what his research was all about.

408
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:20,924
He's very moody,

409
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:24,525
but please try to ask him again
at another time.

410
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:26,297
I will. Good-bye.

411
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,134
Have a safe trip.

412
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:50,958
Well, what are you really
studying now?

413
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:53,656
My father is also wondering

414
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:56,531
what you are studying
these days.

415
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:07,039
Emiko, would you like to see it?

416
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,404
Yes.

417
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:13,781
This must be
strictly confidential.

418
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,308
Sure.

419
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,913
I'm risking my life
in this project.

420
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,815
Would you be able
to keep it a secret?

421
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:24,987
Follow me.

422
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:56,917
Wow!

423
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:07,962
Get back!

424
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:42,398
Emiko, you're the only one
I've shown this to.

425
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:45,399
Don't forget it.

426
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:49,835
Yes, I'll keep my promise.

427
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,949
Welcome back. We missed you.

428
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:04,977
Welcome home.

429
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,730
Did anything happen?

430
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:21,863
No, it was nothing.

431
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:05,908
Has Emiko come back?

432
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:06,939
Yes!

433
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,829
Godzilla!
Godzilla has come back!

434
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:42,447
Ogata!

435
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,849
I couldn't tell him about us.

436
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,924
I am Yamane, Professor Yamane!

437
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:03,899
I'm sorry, but I've been ordered
not to let anyone pass!

438
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:06,459
Then tell your commander
not to use lights on Godzilla!

439
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:07,902
They will only make him angry!

440
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:09,235
He can't be bothered
by that now!

441
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:11,366
Professor,
let's go to that hill.

442
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:15,775
Get back, please!
Get back, please!

443
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:36,209
International Researchers
to Assist!

444
00:47:55,372 --> 00:48:00,776
We are preparing to construct
a 30 meter high, 80 meter deep

445
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:03,837
barbed-wire fence
along the coast.

446
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,406
We will send 50,000 volts
of electric current

447
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:09,908
through the fence in hope of
electrocuting Godzilla to death.

448
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:13,753
We will have
to evacuate the people

449
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:16,782
along the coast, of course,

450
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:21,423
and maintain a safe distance
of 500 meters

451
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:25,333
from the entire fence perimeter.

452
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:29,829
The Coast Guard and the Army
will work

453
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:33,673
to implement this defense plan.

454
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:56,221
Hurry! Hurry!

455
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:02,129
This is a Security
Command Announcement.

456
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:07,474
At 16:30 hours, Godzilla was
sighted north of Kasonzaki,

457
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:10,605
moving in a northeast direction.

458
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:12,740
A maximum security alert
has been issued

459
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,183
for the coastal zones
in the Tokyo vicinity.

460
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:39,002
Third District. Third District.

461
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:44,965
Check! Check!

462
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:46,236
Third district!

463
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:50,007
Check!

464
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:53,879
This is a special news report.
This is a special news report.

465
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:57,114
All residents of the Minato,
Shinagawa and Osaku districts

466
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:59,122
are to begin evacuating
immediately.

467
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,556
Repeating, all residents
of the Minato, Shinagawa

468
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:07,393
and Osaku districts are
to begin evacuating immediately.

469
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:10,195
Please keep your radio on
for further reports.

470
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:15,603
Emiko, today I'm going to ask
for your father's consent.

471
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,937
Will that be all right?

472
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:24,472
Welcome home.

473
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:36,759
What happened, Father?

474
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,468
All they can think about
is killing Godzilla.

475
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:57,012
Why can't they try to study him
from a radiological perspective?

476
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,918
It's an unique opportunity!

477
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:08,348
Professor, I agree with them.

478
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:12,191
Ogata, I do not take
this matter lightly.

479
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:13,662
Godzilla is something

480
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:16,393
that no one in the world
has ever seen,

481
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:19,402
and only those of us in Japan
can study it!

482
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:22,530
But, Professor, that's
no reason to do nothing

483
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:25,268
while this monster
ravages our country.

484
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,640
Isn't Godzilla a product
of the atomic bomb

485
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:29,736
that still haunts
many of us Japanese?

486
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:31,246
Don't you think we should study

487
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:33,078
what keeps a creature
like this alive,

488
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:34,947
regardless of the radiation
it absorbs!

489
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,680
But...

490
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,484
All you want is
to kill Godzilla, too?!

491
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:41,718
Go away! Get out of my house!

492
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,959
I'm very sorry.

493
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:57,173
No, I shouldn't have
upset him like that.

494
00:52:57,207 --> 00:53:00,404
No, Father has been like this.

495
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:10,150
Emiko, give me a chance
to see him again.

496
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:17,522
This is a special bulletin!

497
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:19,358
This is
a special bulletin!

498
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:20,556
Godzilla was spotted

499
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:23,395
moving toward the coastline
several minutes ago.

500
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:25,867
The barbed-wire fence
along the shoreline

501
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:28,735
is about to be charged
with high voltage electricity.

502
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:29,864
We repeat...

503
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:35,911
Direction, 25 to 30 degrees!

504
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:38,244
Distance, 850!

505
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:22,884
Fires are raging through
the Shihabara district.

506
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:24,917
We have no way to put them out.

507
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:28,930
This is Central Command,
come in, unit 465.

508
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:32,331
Central Command,
this is unit 465.

509
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:34,563
The fire that started
in Mitadai-machi

510
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:36,435
has spread to other districts!

511
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:39,635
This is Central Command,
come in, unit 215.

512
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:42,042
Central Command, unit 215.

513
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,842
Our defense lines have broken!

514
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:46,371
Armored division #49
has been destroyed!

515
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,145
The current position
of the target is unknown.

516
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:49,674
We are awaiting further orders,
please!

517
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:54,713
Attention all units!
Attention all units!

518
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:57,726
Initiate Security
Command code 129!

519
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,752
Initiate Security Command
code 129!

520
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:01,957
Prepare to repel attack

521
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:04,295
while carrying out
firefighting procedures.

522
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:07,303
Concentrate efforts
to rescue casualties.

523
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:09,965
Initiate Security Command
code 129!

524
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:12,803
Initiate Security
Command code 129!

525
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:37,315
We'll be joining your father
in just a moment!

526
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,658
A little longer,
a little longer,

527
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,857
and we'll be with your daddy!

528
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:23,670
This is unbelievable,
absolutely unbelievable!

529
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:26,607
Yet, the unbelievable
is happening at this moment,

530
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:28,234
right before our very eyes!

531
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:32,111
Right now, Godzilla is leaving
behind a sea of flame!

532
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:35,743
From Ginza-Owari to Shinbashi,
Tamachi, Chiba and Shinabara,

533
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:38,253
it's all become a sea of flames!

534
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:40,778
Now, Godzilla is starting
to move again!

535
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:43,724
It appears that he is moving
beyond the city limits!

536
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,355
To all of our viewers,
this is not a play or a movie!

537
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:48,624
This is real,

538
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:50,723
the most extraordinary story
of the century!

539
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,894
Is the world going
to be destroyed

540
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:55,096
by a two million-year-old
monster?

541
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:55,096
All personnel to the shelters!

542
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:56,996
All personnel
to the shelters!

543
01:03:57,099 --> 01:04:00,000
Quickly, please!
Quickly, please!

544
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:04,471
Operational Command Staff,
proceed to shelter 306!

545
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:58,794
We are reporting to you live
from a short-wave transmitter.

546
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:01,661
Godzilla is now approaching
this broadcasting station,

547
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:03,221
heading toward our TV tower!

548
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:12,139
There is no time for us
to take cover!

549
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:14,074
We don't know
what will happen to us!

550
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:15,668
He is getting even closer!

551
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:17,178
It looks like our doom!

552
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:19,948
I'm watching as he grabs
onto the tower!

553
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:21,108
He has incredible strength!

554
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:22,378
This broadcast is over!

555
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,079
Good-bye, everyone, good-bye!

556
01:05:38,401 --> 01:05:41,700
Godzilla has turned Tokyo
into a sea of flames!

557
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:43,967
He is moving from Ueno
to Asakusa and Shinagawa,

558
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:45,700
apparently heading
for the river!

559
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:11,993
Damn it! Damn it!

560
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:15,263
Damn it!

561
01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:36,385
Damn it! Damn it!

562
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:09,175
He's running away!

563
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:37,336
He'll be back!
What can we do?

564
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:38,346
Damn it!

565
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:40,780
How can we get rid of him?!
Damn it!

566
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:14,077
Godzilla has retreated
back into the sea.

567
01:09:14,116 --> 01:09:17,085
Professor Yamane has been asked
to work on a plan

568
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:18,609
to defeat the monster.

569
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,554
No details are known
at this time.

570
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:22,079
That is the news for now.

571
01:09:26,362 --> 01:09:29,058
Mr. Ogata
from Southern Sea Salvage.

572
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:31,828
Mr. Ogata from
Southern Sea Salvage.

573
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:34,927
There has been a change
in the scheduled timetable.

574
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,063
Please report
to the briefing room

575
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:38,698
for further instructions.

576
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:12,338
Thank you for your help.

577
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:15,367
Your mother will be okay.

578
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,369
Emiko...

579
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:30,281
Ogata, I have something
important to tell you!

580
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:45,771
I can't stay quiet anymore!

581
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:48,803
I must betray him.

582
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:52,212
Betray?

583
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:55,945
Yes. I made a promise
to Serizawa.

584
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:57,976
Serizawa?

585
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:01,717
It's a secret I've been keeping,
even from you!

586
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:04,726
But, now, I have
to break my promise!

587
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:07,955
It happened on the day

588
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:10,932
that Mr. Hagiwara and I
went to see him.

589
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:12,797
That's when it happened.

590
01:11:23,746 --> 01:11:24,872
Get back!

591
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:15,829
What was that?

592
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:21,860
Yes. All of the oxygen
in the water was disintegrated.

593
01:12:21,904 --> 01:12:24,429
The organisms in the tank
died of asphyxiation.

594
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:27,806
Their remains were liquified
by my Oxygen Destroyer.

595
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:32,780
Overall, it's a device that
splits oxygen atoms into fluids.

596
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:33,804
My...

597
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:44,320
I intended to devote my work to
the study of the element oxygen.

598
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,828
But, in the course
of my research,

599
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:49,831
I came across
an unknown form of energy.

600
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:53,562
In my first experiment,

601
01:12:53,602 --> 01:12:57,561
I discovered a powerful force
that scared me beyond words.

602
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,768
I didn't eat
for two or three days!

603
01:13:11,754 --> 01:13:16,623
Just a little piece of this,
dropped into the water,

604
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:21,322
could turn the entire Tokyo Bay
into a graveyard!

605
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:28,428
Why are you working
on such an awful project?

606
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:30,961
Emiko! I perform my work

607
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:34,965
strictly as
a research scientist!

608
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:37,978
But what if...
what if your discovery

609
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,810
is used
for some horrible purpose?

610
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:42,214
You're right.

611
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:46,119
Used as a weapon, this would be
as powerful as a nuclear bomb.

612
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:50,182
It could totally destroy
humankind!

613
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:58,123
But I believe I can find a use
for the Oxygen Destroyer

614
01:13:58,167 --> 01:14:00,158
that will benefit society.

615
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:03,798
Until then,
I won't reveal its existence.

616
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:05,773
That's why I didn't say anything
to the reporter.

617
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:12,305
If I am forced to surrender
this device

618
01:14:12,347 --> 01:14:14,440
in its present form...

619
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:18,844
I'll make sure the results
of my experiments are destroyed

620
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:20,980
in the event of my death.

621
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:24,080
I understand.

622
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:31,056
I won't tell anyone about this,
not even my own father.

623
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:49,783
I had to break my promise.

624
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:54,980
So that's it?

625
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:59,525
But, Emiko, considering
what Serizawa said,

626
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:02,530
and the fact that this thing
can be of help,

627
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:04,691
I'm sure he will forgive you
for this.

628
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:24,981
Hello. Welcome back.

629
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:29,484
Serizawa.

630
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,891
What? Oh, it's you.

631
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:33,588
I have a favor to ask you today.

632
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:37,656
Well, have a seat.

633
01:15:44,806 --> 01:15:46,137
What do you want from me?

634
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:49,874
I want to use
the Oxygen Destroyer.

635
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:52,312
What Oxygen Destroyer?

636
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:54,872
I don't know
what you're talking about!

637
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:04,789
Serizawa,
why are you pretending?

638
01:16:06,962 --> 01:16:08,088
Pretending?

639
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:13,796
Serizawa, I broke the promise
I made to you.

640
01:16:13,835 --> 01:16:17,134
So I told him everything!

641
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:19,163
Please let him use the device!

642
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:26,911
I'm sorry! Please forgive me!

643
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:36,181
Emiko wanted to help
after seeing the destruction.

644
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:39,288
Please try to forgive her.

645
01:16:42,564 --> 01:16:45,556
Your device is our only hope!

646
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:51,198
Ogata, if Emiko told you
everything about my device,

647
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:54,106
you should know
why I can't let you use it.

648
01:16:54,142 --> 01:16:55,734
I must refuse!

649
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:56,744
Serizawa!

650
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:57,767
No!

651
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,147
Why is it wrong
to use it for this?

652
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:01,171
Please go home!

653
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:03,643
Serizawa!

654
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:09,779
Serizawa!

655
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:12,927
Open the door, please! Serizawa!

656
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:18,232
Serizawa! What are you doing?!

657
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:19,665
Leave me alone!

658
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:20,929
Do you want to destroy years
of research?

659
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:22,799
Let go!

660
01:17:24,773 --> 01:17:25,831
Stop, please!

661
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:32,135
Serizawa!

662
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:37,742
Ogata!

663
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:39,912
Ogata!

664
01:18:07,649 --> 01:18:08,946
Ogata, forgive me.

665
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:13,417
If my device can serve
a good purpose,

666
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:16,253
I would announce it
to everyone in the world!

667
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:18,887
But in its current form,

668
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:21,259
it is just a weapon
of horrible destruction!

669
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:23,865
Please understand, Ogata!

670
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:32,365
I understand,

671
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:36,844
but if we don't use your device
against Godzilla,

672
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:39,108
what are we going to do?

673
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:43,641
Ogata, if the Oxygen Destroyer
is used even once,

674
01:18:43,685 --> 01:18:47,985
politicians from around
the world will see it.

675
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:53,684
Of course, they'll want
to use it as a weapon.

676
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:57,358
Bombs vs. Bombs,
missiles vs. Missiles,

677
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:01,961
and now a new super weapon
to throw upon us all!

678
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:04,267
As a scientist,
no, as a human being,

679
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:06,206
I can't allow that to happen!

680
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:08,665
Am I right?

681
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:23,183
Well, what do we do
about the horror before us now?

682
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:26,456
Should we just let it happen?

683
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:30,261
If anyone can save us now,
Serizawa, you're the only one!

684
01:19:32,968 --> 01:19:37,029
If... you use the device
to defeat Godzilla,

685
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:42,772
unless you reveal what you have
done, who will know about it?

686
01:19:42,811 --> 01:19:46,178
Ogata, humans are weak animals.

687
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:49,507
Even if I burn my notes,

688
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:51,951
the secret will still be
in my head.

689
01:19:54,256 --> 01:19:56,622
Until I die, how can I be sure

690
01:19:56,658 --> 01:20:00,958
I won't be forced by someone
to make the device again?

691
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,029
What am I going to do?

692
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:24,651
"Oh Peace, Oh Light, Return,"
the prayer for peace

693
01:20:24,686 --> 01:20:28,884
that took place
all over the country today.

694
01:20:28,924 --> 01:20:32,826
Here we see the Tokyo chapter
of this event.

695
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:34,123
Listen to the young voices

696
01:20:34,162 --> 01:20:36,960
as they put the strength
of their lives into their song.

697
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:51,575
May we live
without destruction

698
01:20:51,613 --> 01:21:07,086
May we look to tomorrow
with hope

699
01:21:07,128 --> 01:21:21,976
May peace and light
return to us.

700
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:54,791
Serizawa!

701
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,934
Ogata, you are right.

702
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:08,344
But this will be the first
and last time

703
01:23:08,383 --> 01:23:12,319
that I will ever allow
the Oxygen Destroyer to be used.

704
01:23:53,495 --> 01:23:55,827
Don't cry, Emiko.

705
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:00,133
This is the only way to be sure

706
01:24:00,168 --> 01:24:02,659
that it won't fall
into the wrong hands.

707
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:24,919
We are getting closer
to the moment of truth.

708
01:24:24,959 --> 01:24:26,324
We will soon know if Godzilla,

709
01:24:26,361 --> 01:24:28,261
the monster
that has terrorized the world

710
01:24:28,296 --> 01:24:31,060
will be finally buried forever
in the ocean depths.

711
01:24:31,099 --> 01:24:33,590
At this time, Geiger-counter
readings are being used

712
01:24:33,635 --> 01:24:35,262
to pinpoint Godzilla's location.

713
01:24:51,486 --> 01:24:55,855
Ogata, get me a diving suit.

714
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:56,982
What are you saying?!

715
01:24:57,058 --> 01:24:59,583
You have no experience
in using a diving suit!

716
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:05,924
Serizawa... Ogata is right.

717
01:25:06,034 --> 01:25:08,434
Let him do it.

718
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:10,233
Professor, this is

719
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:13,434
the only Oxygen Destroyer
I have!

720
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:17,571
To use it properly,
I have to do it underwater.

721
01:25:24,385 --> 01:25:27,252
All right.
We'll do it together.

722
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:29,654
No. I'll do this myself.

723
01:25:30,758 --> 01:25:32,555
You're crazy.
I won't allow someone

724
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:34,528
with no experience
to go down alone!

725
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:39,462
Hey! Get another
diving suit ready!

726
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:44,838
Okay? Please don't
go down alone!

727
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,584
Will the only Oxygen Destroyer
in the world

728
01:25:57,619 --> 01:25:59,484
be powerful enough
to do the job?

729
01:25:59,521 --> 01:26:02,547
Its inventor, Dr. Serizawa,
remains silent.

730
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:05,684
All we can do now
is pray for its success.

731
01:26:24,612 --> 01:26:25,601
Professor...

732
01:26:34,155 --> 01:26:37,955
I never thought
I'd reveal it in this way.

733
01:26:45,733 --> 01:26:47,530
I'll be praying for you.

734
01:26:56,444 --> 01:26:59,675
All right!
You two be very careful.

735
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:02,410
Ogata, we're counting on you.

736
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:03,439
Right!

737
01:27:05,687 --> 01:27:06,813
The time has come.

738
01:27:06,854 --> 01:27:10,517
Right now, Dr. Serizawa
is being lowered into the water.

739
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:16,450
They've reached the bottom!

740
01:29:57,492 --> 01:29:58,459
Pull!

741
01:29:58,493 --> 01:29:59,482
Start pulling!

742
01:30:34,495 --> 01:30:37,487
Serizawa! Serizawa!

743
01:30:37,532 --> 01:30:38,521
Serizawa!

744
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:39,291
Serizawa! Serizawa!

745
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:43,263
What's going on?! Serizawa!

746
01:31:55,243 --> 01:31:58,872
Ogata, it worked!

747
01:31:58,913 --> 01:32:01,211
Both of you, be happy.

748
01:32:01,249 --> 01:32:05,310
Good-bye... farewell!

749
01:32:10,124 --> 01:32:12,217
Serizawa! Hey, bring him up!

750
01:32:13,094 --> 01:32:14,220
Serizawa!

751
01:32:41,355 --> 01:32:42,754
Serizawa...

752
01:33:55,596 --> 01:33:58,224
This exhilaration,
this jubilation, we have won!

753
01:33:58,265 --> 01:33:59,493
We can see that Godzilla

754
01:33:59,533 --> 01:34:01,967
will never rise
from the ocean's depths again!

755
01:34:02,003 --> 01:34:03,493
This victory
could not be achieved

756
01:34:03,537 --> 01:34:05,971
if it weren't for the young
scientist, Dr. Serizawa.

757
01:34:29,397 --> 01:34:30,887
He wanted us to be happy...

758
01:34:38,673 --> 01:34:40,903
I can't believe that Godzilla

759
01:34:40,941 --> 01:34:44,570
was the only surviving member
of its species...

760
01:34:48,549 --> 01:34:54,249
But, if we keep on conducting
nuclear tests,

761
01:34:54,288 --> 01:35:01,387
it's possible that another
Godzilla might appear...

762
01:35:01,429 --> 01:35:06,662
somewhere in the world, again.

763
01:35:19,847 --> 01:35:21,075
Salute!

764
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:30,550
At ease!
