1
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:42,646
Can you see better
if I move it a little closer?

2
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,916
I can see something.

3
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,715
It's parts of the grid, but it's still rotating.
It's not locking up.

4
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:51,090
Maybe we all need a little break, Lillian.

5
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:52,719
Hal, you take a break.

6
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,331
Michael, we're almost there.

7
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,931
How's that?

8
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:00,734
It's better, but it's all scrambled.

9
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:04,266
- How's that?
- It's better.

10
00:02:05,975 --> 00:02:07,306
How's the synch?

11
00:02:07,443 --> 00:02:09,775
Plus-25. Better?

12
00:02:10,914 --> 00:02:13,109
I can sort of make out part of the grid,
but it's...

13
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,774
I don't know.

14
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:17,544
Maybe something's wrong with the grid.

15
00:02:17,754 --> 00:02:20,655
Hal, kill the grid.
And, Gordy, take a look around the lab.

16
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,366
Oh, this is weird.

17
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,164
Try something else.

18
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:35,402
How's that?

19
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,834
It's an image of the lab, but it's rotating.
It's all out of phase.

20
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,050
I think I've got it.

21
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:50,175
Gordy, go back to the grid for a second.

22
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,788
A little more phase compensator.

23
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:00,696
Up the synch signal.

24
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,722
What do you see, angel?

25
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,399
Clockwise rotation.

26
00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:06,399
It's still all scrambled.

27
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,361
Okay, just a little more.

28
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:12,107
Hold it a second. I think I got it.

29
00:03:13,543 --> 00:03:15,602
Hey, there it is! You got it.

30
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:17,403
Okay, Hal, let's slate it.

31
00:03:17,513 --> 00:03:19,708
Gordy, follow Hal around with the slate.

32
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:29,188
Hal, get the slate in there.

33
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:30,585
I got it.

34
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:32,684
Hold it one minute.

35
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,811
Okay. Slate it.

36
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:12,698
We've got speed.

37
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:15,602
Test, October 11th, 10:41 p. m. Mark.

38
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:22,844
To the kitchen.

39
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:24,675
Good idea. Let's eat.

40
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,818
Lou, what do you got for me?

41
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:40,886
Here you go, Gordy. Everything you said.

42
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:42,556
- Slating.
- It's all bad.

43
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:43,891
Hot and cold...

44
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:45,195
...sweet and sour...

45
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:48,097
...chewy and melt-in-your-mouth bad!

46
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:50,000
Let's try something exotic.

47
00:04:50,173 --> 00:04:51,663
You name it, Gordy.

48
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:53,969
A little steak.

49
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,840
A little steak comin' up.

50
00:04:55,912 --> 00:04:57,174
Peanut butter.

51
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,674
Peanut butter.

52
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:00,674
Hot fudge!

53
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:02,446
Hot fudge?

54
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,110
A few nuts.

55
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,617
And some marshmallow sauce.

56
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,983
Marshmallow sauce.

57
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:11,720
And put a cherry on top.

58
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,795
Man, marshmallow and cherry on steak?

59
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:18,230
What in the world have you been drinkin'?

60
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:20,768
What's he been smokin'?

61
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:38,453
Hey, spaceman,
welcome back to the planet Earth.

62
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:42,317
What you see before you is the latest
fashion in full sensory gratification.

63
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:43,859
- Now, come on, give us a kiss.
- No.

64
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,018
- Come on.
- No!

65
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,584
Come on, let's go back to work.

66
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:48,220
- Gordy, go on!
- For science.

67
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:50,162
Gordy, try to contain yourself.

68
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,395
This is a test.

69
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:57,734
Andrea, give us a 90 DBF
in sine wave, please.

70
00:05:58,007 --> 00:05:59,372
Okay, I'm ready.

71
00:06:02,345 --> 00:06:03,334
Slate.

72
00:06:22,398 --> 00:06:24,593
Gordy, this is not on our itinerary.

73
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:27,359
Just a few seconds. I think I got an idea.

74
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,664
Well, hi, Hal. How are you?

75
00:06:28,771 --> 00:06:30,363
What are you guys up to, anyway?

76
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:32,607
Just wanna see my old buddy, Lena.

77
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:38,708
How are you, Lena, honey?

78
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:44,785
Lena, I know what it's like
to be guinea pig.

79
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:56,126
Is her output on standard interface?

80
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,294
Regular plug.

81
00:07:01,471 --> 00:07:02,836
I don't know...

82
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:06,036
Perfect mate for Dr. Brace.

83
00:07:06,142 --> 00:07:08,440
I don't know if that's such a good idea.

84
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:12,403
- That's not so funny, Gordy.
- Come in, Lena.

85
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:43,642
What did you do?

86
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:46,874
Nothing. Just a little experiment
in animal behavior.

87
00:07:51,787 --> 00:07:54,483
There's something wrong with you.
You know that?

88
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:57,015
You didn't like Lena.

89
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,921
- What happened?
- Nothing.

90
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:01,620
So?

91
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:03,392
I'm telling you, it works!

92
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:05,457
The tests? Sound, taste...?

93
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,499
Everything, everything.
One hundred percent. In fact, better.

94
00:08:08,604 --> 00:08:09,866
Well, what did you taste?

95
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:11,930
Steak, overdone. Right?

96
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:15,671
Peanut butter, hot fudge sauce,
slight orange flavor.

97
00:08:15,945 --> 00:08:17,708
- Disgusting.
- Nuts?

98
00:08:17,947 --> 00:08:19,778
Walnuts. I hate them.

99
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,878
That's it?

100
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:23,818
Marshmallow...

101
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:26,116
- Cherry on the top.
- That's it man!

102
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,817
How do you feel now?

103
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,757
I feel like a glass of champagne.
Get some glasses.

104
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:33,694
Congratulations.

105
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:36,053
What's this?

106
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:37,463
One lousy beer.

107
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:41,302
I would like to make a toast.

108
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,963
To the one who never gives up...

109
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:47,366
...Lillian Reynolds...

110
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:50,976
...E. E., M. D., Ph. D...

111
00:08:53,082 --> 00:08:54,515
...B. M. T...

112
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,011
...B. V. D., R. S. V. P., C. O. D.

113
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,752
My friend.

114
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:04,187
Cheers.

115
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:06,887
Cheers.

116
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:44,624
'Night.

117
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,840
Hi, Dad.

118
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:05,477
Hi, Mike.

119
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:08,479
You worked late.
Did you have a good day?

120
00:11:09,652 --> 00:11:10,812
Hello, Barry.

121
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,786
Success.

122
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:53,721
We made it.

123
00:12:04,373 --> 00:12:06,273
Talented man, your husband.

124
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:08,941
Impossible at times, but talented.

125
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:11,170
What do you think? Can you handle it?

126
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,114
Yes, I think I can.
I think I can get it down to size...

127
00:12:15,284 --> 00:12:17,047
...and make it look attractive.

128
00:12:17,353 --> 00:12:19,082
Maybe something like...

129
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:20,788
...stereo headphones.

130
00:12:20,956 --> 00:12:23,117
Oh, I'm not worried about that.
I know you can.

131
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:24,318
It's Michael.

132
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:28,196
You're gonna have to work
very closely with him.

133
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,196
Is that a problem?

134
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:31,333
No.

135
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:34,028
- That won't be any problem.
- Good.

136
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,068
Not for me.

137
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:38,163
Hal, I'm gonna kill you after this.

138
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,037
Lillian, you don't understand.
It's part of my...

139
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:43,211
- What are you upset about?
- It's gonna be slow and agonizing.

140
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,941
It's not part of your job.
I know what you wanted to do.

141
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:47,810
You wanted to grease yourself
with the boss.

142
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:48,611
I did not.

143
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,982
Why don't you wait and see
what he has to say?

144
00:12:51,554 --> 00:12:53,647
Why don't you grow up!

145
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:57,156
Be careful.

146
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:01,995
I hate this junk!

147
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,299
Hello, Michael.

148
00:13:06,635 --> 00:13:08,227
Good to see you.

149
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:09,836
- Lillian.
- Hi, Alex. How are you?

150
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,870
Well, won't you sit down?

151
00:13:19,248 --> 00:13:20,180
Well...

152
00:13:20,282 --> 00:13:21,510
...congratulations.

153
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:22,709
For what?

154
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:25,517
Hal said you had a breakthrough.

155
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,887
Well, Hal's crazy.

156
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,619
Did you have a breakthrough or not?

157
00:13:35,998 --> 00:13:36,987
Yes.

158
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:44,569
Alex, dear, it was just another test.
A little better, but still crude.

159
00:13:45,474 --> 00:13:46,941
What's the big problem?

160
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:51,246
The superconductors have to be chilled
to 270 below to work.

161
00:13:51,814 --> 00:13:53,941
The whole thing is too big and heavy.

162
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,616
Your hotshots, Evans and Wetmore,
failed on that one year after year.

163
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:06,351
Courtesy, Evans-Wetmore.

164
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:12,866
It's a superconducting chip.
No cooling needed.

165
00:14:13,969 --> 00:14:15,368
When did they do this?

166
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:16,896
You need it...

167
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:18,200
...it's yours.

168
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:19,768
Keep it quiet.

169
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:22,333
Data processing division
will go right through the roof...

170
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:25,379
...with the high-speed
computer applications of that thing.

171
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:28,712
Karen has expressed enthusiasm
to help us market it and package it.

172
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,082
Alex, I think you're moving too fast.

173
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,482
You haven't even seen it yet.

174
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:37,183
There's more to it
than just practical applications...

175
00:14:37,493 --> 00:14:38,687
...and packaging.

176
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,486
Lillian...

177
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:44,297
...I know you can do it.

178
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:47,167
I know you can do it.

179
00:14:49,204 --> 00:14:51,104
I'd like a demonstration.

180
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:52,874
I want you...

181
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,970
...to knock my socks off. Okay?

182
00:15:02,785 --> 00:15:03,774
Good!

183
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,747
And thanks.

184
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:09,322
Don't lose that.

185
00:15:12,094 --> 00:15:13,925
You did it again, Alex.

186
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:16,253
Thank you.

187
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:18,525
Any problem working with Karen?

188
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:23,929
No. Not for me.

189
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:26,832
Thanks, Mike.

190
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,182
I told you to get out of the pool.
He pays no attention.

191
00:15:37,252 --> 00:15:38,651
I'll get him, honey.

192
00:15:41,657 --> 00:15:42,885
Hurry up!

193
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:48,153
Dr. Brace, I'd like to introduce
Dr. Harris and Dr. Bock.

194
00:15:48,297 --> 00:15:49,662
Call me Ted.

195
00:15:53,736 --> 00:15:55,067
You saw the house before.

196
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:57,704
Yeah, yeah, we're sold.
We just want to get all the details.

197
00:15:57,806 --> 00:15:59,797
- We signed all the papers today.
- Good.

198
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:01,671
- That's for you.
- Hey, Dad, is that it?

199
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,574
- That's what you wanted.
- All right. You got the right one.

200
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:07,048
Say thank you.

201
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:11,382
As you can see...

202
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:15,149
...this is a very special house.

203
00:16:17,092 --> 00:16:19,185
I spent a lot of time to get it right.

204
00:16:21,964 --> 00:16:23,932
Why don't you show them
the secret closet?

205
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:25,694
Good idea. Right this way.

206
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:29,464
The house is wonderful. Ted loves
all the special things you've done.

207
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,097
Do you like them?

208
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,433
No.

209
00:16:35,944 --> 00:16:37,912
- It's theirs now.
- I know.

210
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:43,075
I can't stay here now.

211
00:16:44,286 --> 00:16:46,277
Oh, well, that's okay. I can...

212
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,148
...take care of all the packing and stuff.

213
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:51,091
- You sure?
- Sure.

214
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,889
It's a lot to do.

215
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:55,593
Do you have cardboard boxes?

216
00:16:56,198 --> 00:16:58,029
Yes, I have cardboard boxes.

217
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:01,235
I can take care of it all. Don't worry.

218
00:17:04,006 --> 00:17:06,236
You could go live over at the center.

219
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:07,639
Lillian's there.

220
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:17,618
This is Flight Simulation Lab Control.

221
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,276
Sold your house yet?

222
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:22,012
Yep.

223
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,560
I keep telling you
the rooms at the center are so cheap.

224
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,595
I know.

225
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:33,332
At 9:38 p. m. pilot Gordon Forbes is
performing a low-level simulated assault.

226
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:38,534
Range: 100 yards and closing.

227
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,672
Ninety-five.

228
00:17:42,878 --> 00:17:46,245
Ninety. Simulated altitude, 60 feet.

229
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:49,311
Ground speed, 512 knots.

230
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:53,180
Assault range, 85.

231
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,682
Eighty.

232
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:58,591
It's not worth it, Gordy! Don't do it!

233
00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:03,130
Pilot Forbes, you're...

234
00:18:03,198 --> 00:18:05,098
...off of the simulation.

235
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:06,962
Sweet target in sight.

236
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:10,734
Dr. Reynolds, Dr. Brace...

237
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:13,502
...your pilot has lost control.

238
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,279
Ready.

239
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,645
- Helmet's on?
- Yeah.

240
00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:22,614
Contact. Okay, let's get in.

241
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,118
How's that? Okay.

242
00:18:25,554 --> 00:18:27,181
Give me the seat belts.

243
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:28,984
Okay, Gordy. Hit it.

244
00:18:30,092 --> 00:18:31,719
Great gas pedal. Let's go!

245
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,532
Come on, Gordy!

246
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:46,571
Yeah, I'm comin'. Wait a minute.

247
00:18:46,842 --> 00:18:48,776
Tallyho! Here we go!

248
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:53,810
- I'm gonna die. I'm freezing!
- You're gonna make history!

249
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:58,180
- It's a little chilly. It's gonna be great!
- I don't wanna go! It's too cold!

250
00:19:04,326 --> 00:19:06,260
Come on. One more time for science.

251
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:08,888
It's gonna rain, Gordy. Let's go home!

252
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:11,592
- Too cold. It's not even...
- Come on, come on.

253
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:13,567
We're gonna do it. Come on, get in.

254
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:35,618
Nobody is gonna put a thing like that
on their head.

255
00:19:35,691 --> 00:19:38,660
It's gotta be pared down
to the absolute essentials.

256
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,161
Just enough to house the sensors.
You know, it can't look intimidating.

257
00:19:42,231 --> 00:19:44,358
What do I care what it looks like!

258
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:51,103
Put a chip here...

259
00:19:51,406 --> 00:19:52,771
...another here...

260
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:54,400
...here...

261
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:58,107
...an op. Amp, spread flat across.
That's all. Just do it.

262
00:19:58,213 --> 00:20:00,613
- Put the rest of the stuff remote.
- Sure.

263
00:20:20,102 --> 00:20:21,399
How's that?

264
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,963
It's good.

265
00:20:23,238 --> 00:20:24,637
Good night, all.

266
00:21:04,646 --> 00:21:05,977
Don't fall!

267
00:21:06,048 --> 00:21:07,276
Hang on, Gordy!

268
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,680
Come on, Gordy!

269
00:21:09,151 --> 00:21:10,618
Way to go!

270
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:28,763
Oh, God!

271
00:21:31,673 --> 00:21:32,867
That's remarkable.

272
00:21:32,941 --> 00:21:36,206
A true, one-of-a-kind
scientific breakthrough.

273
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:38,408
Oh, God! Wonderful!

274
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,607
We'll have to tell the division heads.

275
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:44,379
And Karen, you think we can modify it
and simplify it even a little more?

276
00:21:44,453 --> 00:21:47,115
- Yes. That's already in the works.
- Good.

277
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:50,255
We'll need to make a demo tape.
We want to show the potential...

278
00:21:50,325 --> 00:21:52,816
...for travel and education and news.

279
00:21:54,162 --> 00:21:55,959
Can we do it in the conference room?

280
00:21:56,031 --> 00:21:58,226
We could pump right through the phone.

281
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,234
Excellent. And thank you all.

282
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:02,263
You've blown communication...

283
00:22:02,337 --> 00:22:05,602
...as we've known it, right out of the water.
You know that, don't you?

284
00:22:05,674 --> 00:22:07,232
And I'm very proud of all of you.

285
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:08,867
You blew my socks off!

286
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:12,703
I think he likes it.

287
00:22:19,988 --> 00:22:21,319
All right!

288
00:22:46,214 --> 00:22:47,442
It's great.

289
00:22:50,252 --> 00:22:51,583
Really?

290
00:22:52,654 --> 00:22:53,712
It's great.

291
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:54,813
Good.

292
00:22:55,891 --> 00:22:57,381
I'm glad you like it.

293
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:02,690
You know...

294
00:23:02,898 --> 00:23:05,059
...we never worked together before.

295
00:23:06,835 --> 00:23:09,963
I always tried to avoid that, you know.

296
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:02,506
Sorry about that, ladies.

297
00:26:25,033 --> 00:26:26,898
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

298
00:26:28,903 --> 00:26:29,995
Well?

299
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:32,229
So tell me about it.

300
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:34,207
It's the damnedest thing I've ever felt.

301
00:26:34,276 --> 00:26:36,176
Knocked my socks off.

302
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,009
What was it like?

303
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:39,613
Like you were there.

304
00:26:39,814 --> 00:26:42,374
Taste, smell, everything.

305
00:26:42,951 --> 00:26:44,316
Incredible.

306
00:26:44,486 --> 00:26:46,386
I even feel like I just ate.

307
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:50,149
What about military applications?

308
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:52,017
It's wide open.

309
00:26:53,094 --> 00:26:54,527
Missile guidance? That kind of thing?

310
00:26:54,596 --> 00:26:57,622
Jim, they're gonna be able to plug
right into the old noodle.

311
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,954
- This is for us?
- Just us.

312
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:24,321
Just you, just me.

313
00:27:27,162 --> 00:27:28,356
Just for us.

314
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,830
- Congratulations, you guys.
- Thank you.

315
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:33,399
This is great.

316
00:27:33,468 --> 00:27:37,029
I've never had so many people
want to talk to me before in my life.

317
00:27:37,105 --> 00:27:38,572
That's cause you're famous.

318
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,267
Oh, God! You love it!

319
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:41,364
I do.

320
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,405
You're good-lookin', too.

321
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:47,779
Hey, get me a light, will ya?

322
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,578
- Can I borrow that?
- Sure. Here.

323
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,388
You smoke too much.

324
00:27:57,992 --> 00:27:59,220
I know I do.

325
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:06,727
- How you doin'?
- We're doing fine.

326
00:28:06,835 --> 00:28:11,101
Listen, I've got some people I want you
to meet... upstairs in a few minutes, okay?

327
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:13,470
You're my stars. I want to show you off.

328
00:28:13,908 --> 00:28:16,308
I'll have Hal come back and get you.

329
00:28:16,544 --> 00:28:18,102
Don't disappoint me.

330
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,140
A few people upstairs. That's it. That's it!

331
00:28:34,729 --> 00:28:37,163
- Barry, I'd love some more white wine.
- Sure.

332
00:28:38,933 --> 00:28:40,924
I'll call you tomorrow, Wendy.

333
00:28:41,703 --> 00:28:43,762
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

334
00:28:48,943 --> 00:28:49,932
Thanks.

335
00:28:50,211 --> 00:28:51,974
Why do you still see him?

336
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,678
Because he's a perfectly wonderful,
thoughtful, uncreative guy.

337
00:28:59,687 --> 00:29:01,382
Congratulations, Michael.

338
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,686
You must be proud to be married
to such a brilliant man.

339
00:29:05,026 --> 00:29:06,493
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

340
00:29:06,561 --> 00:29:08,722
He never spoke to me before.

341
00:29:08,963 --> 00:29:11,693
It's good to see you
enjoying yourself so much.

342
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:13,022
For you.

343
00:29:13,101 --> 00:29:15,160
I'll see you later, upstairs.

344
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:22,066
This is the result of teamwork, gentlemen.

345
00:29:22,243 --> 00:29:23,471
A group of...

346
00:29:23,945 --> 00:29:27,972
...brilliant, creative scientists cocoon
for ten years in a laboratory without...

347
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:29,744
...outside intervention.

348
00:29:30,318 --> 00:29:32,684
My job has been to protect
that environment.

349
00:29:32,754 --> 00:29:36,212
That lab is sacred ground.
And, with due respect to you all...

350
00:29:37,258 --> 00:29:41,160
...I don't want to muddy it with any boots
from outside, military or civilian.

351
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:45,131
That's all very well, Dr. Terson,
but we paid for that cocoon.

352
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,835
I think we have every right to know
what goes on.

353
00:29:47,902 --> 00:29:49,494
I accept that responsibility, sir.

354
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:52,233
I'm not talking about
a military or civilian potential now.

355
00:29:52,307 --> 00:29:54,502
I am talking about a breakthrough.

356
00:29:54,976 --> 00:29:57,206
A communications breakthrough.

357
00:29:58,179 --> 00:29:59,646
Words don't do it.

358
00:30:00,014 --> 00:30:02,073
Pictures don't do it. This...

359
00:30:02,617 --> 00:30:04,414
...might be the beginning.

360
00:30:04,686 --> 00:30:07,246
But you've got to let my people breathe.

361
00:30:08,122 --> 00:30:09,384
You've got to...

362
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:11,815
Well, here they are.

363
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,521
Lillian, good to see you again.

364
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:16,829
I didn't see you downstairs, Colonel.

365
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:20,265
Well, we all just got in
and we can only stay a few minutes.

366
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,630
Captain Barty.

367
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:24,399
Mr. Zimbach.

368
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,707
Colonel Easterbrook.

369
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:30,742
- And Landon Marks.
- It's a real, real pleasure, Dr. Reynolds.

370
00:30:31,613 --> 00:30:34,548
- Do I know you?
- Yes. Cal Tech. '56.

371
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,408
I wanted you all to get to know each other.

372
00:30:38,653 --> 00:30:40,348
Dr. Reynolds, of course.

373
00:30:40,455 --> 00:30:41,717
Karen Brace...

374
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,322
...Dr. Brace.

375
00:30:44,192 --> 00:30:45,750
And Mr. Abramson.

376
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,869
We're tremendously enthusiastic
about your recent breakthrough.

377
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,906
Yes. We've been working on
an array system ourselves...

378
00:30:58,973 --> 00:31:00,668
...but with slow progress.

379
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:02,433
That's understandable.

380
00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:05,774
Of course, we've been looking
at the application...

381
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:07,712
...from a different point of view.

382
00:31:08,249 --> 00:31:12,049
What point of view is that, Colonel?
Blowing people to kingdom come?

383
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:19,994
Lillian, I think we can let
the colonel express his opinion.

384
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,300
Not everything in the military is
blowing people up.

385
00:31:27,368 --> 00:31:30,428
We're interested in tapping in
to higher brain functions:

386
00:31:30,505 --> 00:31:32,871
Thoughts, emotions, that kind of thing.

387
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,610
Now I remember you.

388
00:31:37,378 --> 00:31:39,209
We're working on that, too.

389
00:31:40,682 --> 00:31:42,013
Shut up, Michael.

390
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,086
You don't know what's going on, do you?

391
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,092
Why don't we all have a drink?

392
00:31:53,595 --> 00:31:55,654
- I don't get it.
- No, you don't.

393
00:31:56,297 --> 00:31:57,355
Excuse me.

394
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:09,675
Lillian, I don't think Dr. Marks's presence
will be a detriment to the project.

395
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,706
Alex, I'm sorry.

396
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,504
No. I have to say no.

397
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:18,552
Dr. Reynolds, for your own sake,
I'd like to help you complete your records.

398
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,612
A woman of your stature can't
just sloppily jot down...

399
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,351
Alex, please.
You promised you wouldn't do this.

400
00:32:24,726 --> 00:32:26,455
He's a spy for the Feds.

401
00:32:27,395 --> 00:32:31,058
The Feds, as you call it,
are here to protect the American public...

402
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:33,758
...from potentially dangerous research.

403
00:32:33,835 --> 00:32:35,132
Alex, no!

404
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,129
No!

405
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:40,436
I want you to understand, Dr. Reynolds,
that my function is not to be a spy.

406
00:32:41,142 --> 00:32:43,110
I do have a certain expertise.

407
00:32:43,177 --> 00:32:45,577
Listen, you were a hack at Stanford
and a hack at Bell!

408
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,079
He's on your team.

409
00:32:47,148 --> 00:32:47,978
Why?

410
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,574
- He is on your team!
- No!

411
00:32:50,652 --> 00:32:53,450
- Lillian, goddamn it, the man just wants...
- Alex!

412
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,046
Don't goddamn me, sweetheart.

413
00:32:56,658 --> 00:32:58,421
- Just don't goddamn me!
- Come on.

414
00:32:58,493 --> 00:33:00,256
And don't take my project!

415
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,488
This is my project!

416
00:33:04,265 --> 00:33:08,133
And I don't want to see it end up
on some Defense scrap heap...

417
00:33:08,202 --> 00:33:10,670
...before we know what it's really about!

418
00:33:11,172 --> 00:33:13,299
You have no idea!

419
00:33:23,017 --> 00:33:24,075
Well...

420
00:33:26,154 --> 00:33:27,086
I'm sorry.

421
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,079
You're gonna spoil the whole thing!

422
00:33:55,483 --> 00:33:58,418
- You're so stupid!
- I want to tell you something!

423
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:01,483
I don't like the way you treat me
in front of these people!

424
00:34:01,556 --> 00:34:03,080
You keep calling this thing "mine. "

425
00:34:03,157 --> 00:34:05,523
I've been standing next to you
from the start. It's mine, too.

426
00:34:05,593 --> 00:34:06,958
So don't do that!

427
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,759
- You don't get it!
- Lillian?

428
00:34:09,997 --> 00:34:12,056
- Keep him out. Keep him out!
- Go!

429
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:15,193
Lillian, I have tried to keep those people
off your back, but you've got...

430
00:34:15,269 --> 00:34:16,361
What is it?

431
00:34:16,571 --> 00:34:18,630
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'll be fine.

432
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,604
You look bad.

433
00:34:21,442 --> 00:34:22,466
Thanks.

434
00:34:22,577 --> 00:34:23,942
You want a doctor?

435
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,510
I am a doctor!

436
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,614
What's going on? Are you crazy?

437
00:34:27,682 --> 00:34:31,015
This is the ladies' room.
It's the ladies' room!

438
00:34:33,387 --> 00:34:34,786
Can I help you?

439
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,688
It makes me sick when I lose my temper.

440
00:34:55,943 --> 00:34:57,911
- Here she is.
- I don't want that thing, Gordy.

441
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:00,480
Hal, I can't believe
that you didn't know about it.

442
00:35:00,548 --> 00:35:02,675
Everybody at this party played it.

443
00:35:03,117 --> 00:35:05,608
Now, you don't want
to get left behind, Hal.

444
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,620
This is hot!

445
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:08,746
No.

446
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:12,525
It sure beats dirty magazines.

447
00:35:17,565 --> 00:35:19,328
Yeah, thank you, Gordy.

448
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,197
Enjoy yourself.

449
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:25,633
Yeah, sure.

450
00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:34,706
You're crazy!

451
00:35:34,782 --> 00:35:36,249
Come on, let's do it!

452
00:35:36,317 --> 00:35:39,115
- Let's do it for science, baby.
- I don't trust you.

453
00:35:39,187 --> 00:35:41,280
I won't do it in here.
Anybody can come in.

454
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:44,324
Lillian won't be back tonight.
I promise. She won't be back.

455
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,383
- You promise?
- Come on, I promise.

456
00:35:46,627 --> 00:35:48,322
Come on, babe.

457
00:35:50,464 --> 00:35:51,863
All right.

458
00:37:00,434 --> 00:37:01,731
Are these real?

459
00:37:02,503 --> 00:37:03,595
I hope so.

460
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:07,933
This is it.

461
00:37:22,423 --> 00:37:23,947
What do you call this?

462
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:25,458
We call it "the Hat. "

463
00:37:26,727 --> 00:37:28,319
What do you do with it?

464
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,597
Put it on your head.

465
00:37:36,437 --> 00:37:38,462
Come on, Chris. Hands off.

466
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:42,770
What's it for?

467
00:37:43,444 --> 00:37:47,005
With a thing like that, you could finish
the seventh grade in five minutes.

468
00:37:47,081 --> 00:37:48,776
Okay. Start it up.

469
00:37:50,785 --> 00:37:51,877
Not today.

470
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,484
What's that?

471
00:38:00,061 --> 00:38:01,085
I don't know.

472
00:38:02,263 --> 00:38:03,594
Scan synch's on.

473
00:38:04,465 --> 00:38:05,659
You got that?

474
00:38:08,302 --> 00:38:09,701
Interlock's open.

475
00:38:09,904 --> 00:38:10,893
Okay.

476
00:38:12,673 --> 00:38:14,004
It's hot off the mold.

477
00:38:14,075 --> 00:38:15,201
Take a look.

478
00:38:17,278 --> 00:38:18,745
Looks great.

479
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,547
Sit, please.

480
00:38:21,115 --> 00:38:22,707
"Looks great. Sit, please. "

481
00:38:22,783 --> 00:38:24,978
Now just empty your head.

482
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,384
Empty my head?

483
00:38:32,093 --> 00:38:33,117
Relax.

484
00:38:35,496 --> 00:38:37,464
Empty my head and relax.

485
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,233
Just lean back and forget everything.
It'll be okay.

486
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:03,151
That's good.

487
00:39:25,312 --> 00:39:27,507
It's hot off the mold. Take a look.

488
00:39:34,855 --> 00:39:36,288
Relax.

489
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:41,291
You can take the house, the kid, the car,
the whole goddamn thing!

490
00:39:41,395 --> 00:39:44,057
I don't want anything. I'll live in a hotel.

491
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,834
What about my work?
I can't live like this, Karen.

492
00:39:50,071 --> 00:39:51,095
Go.

493
00:39:53,574 --> 00:39:55,166
Why don't you just go?

494
00:40:02,116 --> 00:40:04,710
Take the house, take the car!

495
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,078
I'll go to a hotel!

496
00:40:07,288 --> 00:40:10,280
I can't live like this, Karen!
You're strangling me!

497
00:40:11,425 --> 00:40:14,019
What are you talking about,
you can't live like this?

498
00:40:14,095 --> 00:40:16,586
Are you talking about the house?
I never wanted it.

499
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,632
- It was you!
- No, no. It's you!

500
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,725
That's not me you're looking at. It's you!

501
00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:38,115
Can you describe what you were feeling?

502
00:40:40,321 --> 00:40:41,515
I don't know.

503
00:40:42,056 --> 00:40:43,216
I got mad...

504
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,083
...at you.

505
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:56,861
What were you thinking?

506
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:00,570
You mean when you were recording
my thoughts?

507
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:01,767
Yeah.

508
00:41:02,176 --> 00:41:05,168
I was thinking about my new design.

509
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,141
But he always ignores me and it just...

510
00:41:10,017 --> 00:41:11,450
...made me furious.

511
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:17,916
Feelings.

512
00:41:41,348 --> 00:41:43,509
It's hot off the mold. Take a look.

513
00:41:44,618 --> 00:41:47,883
- You're so selfish! You're arrogant!
- You're strangling me!

514
00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:10,902
I want to ride my bike. Big deal.

515
00:42:14,415 --> 00:42:16,508
You take him. His pants are full.

516
00:42:19,887 --> 00:42:22,048
You could put flowers all around it.

517
00:42:22,189 --> 00:42:24,589
I don't know what you're so upset about.

518
00:42:37,871 --> 00:42:39,771
Let's do the twist.

519
00:42:52,553 --> 00:42:54,077
You are a genius.

520
00:43:48,575 --> 00:43:50,042
I made that for you.

521
00:43:50,577 --> 00:43:51,703
It's a gift.

522
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:54,973
What is it?

523
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,778
It's me.

524
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,912
You may kiss the bride.

525
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,361
That's where they flew.

526
00:44:51,238 --> 00:44:53,399
But what made them come here?

527
00:44:53,707 --> 00:44:55,265
It's the wind.

528
00:44:57,711 --> 00:44:58,700
The wind?

529
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,911
It's constant here.

530
00:45:00,981 --> 00:45:05,179
He took off from the bottom of that hill.
And the first flight was...

531
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,088
...less than the wingspan of a modern jet.

532
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:13,756
And I want to tell you something.
He was scared to death.

533
00:45:14,695 --> 00:45:16,185
I'm crazy about you!

534
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:20,195
It's a secret.
That's the girl I'm gonna marry.

535
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,255
We blew it, didn't we?

536
00:45:49,797 --> 00:45:50,957
We sure did.

537
00:45:53,467 --> 00:45:55,435
- I didn't...
- I didn't understand.

538
00:45:57,971 --> 00:45:59,461
Nothing's changed.

539
00:46:11,151 --> 00:46:12,641
You feel so good.

540
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,186
So do you.

541
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,032
I never thought I could do this.

542
00:47:29,496 --> 00:47:30,986
It always does that.

543
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:36,495
Try that.

544
00:47:37,905 --> 00:47:39,270
They're beautiful.

545
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,536
Are you ready to take the plunge?

546
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,304
Sure.

547
00:48:00,527 --> 00:48:02,825
Sing for me. Sing me that song.

548
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:07,095
"In this place
We're all together now

549
00:48:07,768 --> 00:48:11,204
"Figuring out and figuring out
Who's crazy

550
00:48:12,406 --> 00:48:15,307
"And afterwards, we go out
And have a nice coffee

551
00:48:15,943 --> 00:48:18,411
"And we smoke a cigarette
And make a dream

552
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,946
"That everybody in the world
Will be good

553
00:48:22,716 --> 00:48:24,809
"And then we'll be nervous no more

554
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,318
"And these are the hopes and the dreams

555
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:31,581
"Of beautiful people like me

556
00:48:32,392 --> 00:48:33,984
"And the other people"

557
00:48:34,294 --> 00:48:35,591
It's so quiet.

558
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,997
I was afraid you didn't like me anymore.

559
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:42,995
Marry me.

560
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:46,663
I will.

561
00:49:05,993 --> 00:49:07,051
Mom?

562
00:49:09,262 --> 00:49:10,854
- Hi, Dad.
- Good morning.

563
00:49:10,931 --> 00:49:12,125
Hiya, sport.

564
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,528
I knew you couldn't live without us.

565
00:49:18,105 --> 00:49:19,868
- You want breakfast?
- Sure.

566
00:49:20,073 --> 00:49:22,200
- French toast.
- Orange juice.

567
00:49:22,275 --> 00:49:23,264
- Juice.
- All right.

568
00:49:23,343 --> 00:49:24,435
Bacon.

569
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,533
He's in the den.

570
00:49:47,868 --> 00:49:49,699
- Are you okay?
- He's out of control.

571
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:51,328
But are you okay?

572
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:56,175
Karen, he's been down there all night.

573
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,268
I thought he was reading
until I woke up this morning...

574
00:49:58,345 --> 00:50:00,813
...and I found him down there twitching.

575
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:51,058
Give it here.

576
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,667
Give it, Michael.

577
00:50:58,238 --> 00:51:01,173
Please. Oh, God, please. Please!

578
00:51:01,842 --> 00:51:02,866
Please!

579
00:51:18,225 --> 00:51:20,523
We'll keep this between us, okay?

580
00:51:20,594 --> 00:51:24,655
Barometric pressure equalized.
Dr. Brace, you may enter the chamber.

581
00:51:29,903 --> 00:51:30,892
Damn it!

582
00:51:39,546 --> 00:51:41,104
Hey, you wanna jog a few laps?

583
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,648
No, not today, Hal.

584
00:51:44,151 --> 00:51:46,813
I don't know where I'm getting
all this energy.

585
00:51:48,488 --> 00:51:49,955
Well, you look good.

586
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:53,720
I'll tell you, Mike, boy,
I'm gettin' a whole new outlook on life.

587
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:56,518
I'm packing my bags
and leaving this place.

588
00:51:56,596 --> 00:51:57,893
Why is that?

589
00:51:58,064 --> 00:52:01,591
Hell, the good folks at the lab
are paying me disability leave...

590
00:52:01,668 --> 00:52:03,761
...of indeterminate duration.

591
00:52:04,404 --> 00:52:05,701
Is that good?

592
00:52:05,906 --> 00:52:08,534
Hell, it's the best piece of luck I've had.

593
00:52:14,514 --> 00:52:15,742
What is it?

594
00:52:31,698 --> 00:52:35,225
Something happened to me.
It was more than just a sexual fantasy.

595
00:52:35,302 --> 00:52:37,668
It was a... it was a feeling I had.

596
00:52:43,343 --> 00:52:45,072
I'm more than I was, Mike.

597
00:52:48,949 --> 00:52:49,973
More.

598
00:52:58,592 --> 00:52:59,786
Thanks, Hal.

599
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:03,887
Okay, make a dupe tape and a transcript
of that right away, if you would.

600
00:53:14,474 --> 00:53:16,101
Ten degrees right.

601
00:53:17,344 --> 00:53:18,504
Level.

602
00:53:19,479 --> 00:53:20,503
Good.

603
00:53:35,262 --> 00:53:36,354
Now watch this.

604
00:53:36,429 --> 00:53:41,128
He can take a full 10-G rollout without
losing control, just by thinking about it.

605
00:53:42,936 --> 00:53:44,403
Bombs away, Gordon.

606
00:54:48,268 --> 00:54:49,292
Damn!

607
00:55:15,996 --> 00:55:17,122
No!

608
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,454
Mike!

609
00:58:44,637 --> 00:58:45,365
Lillian?

610
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,587
I'll miss her.

611
00:59:42,562 --> 00:59:43,859
Talented lady.

612
00:59:44,931 --> 00:59:47,491
Impossible at times, but talented.

613
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,865
The project's yours now, Mike.
It's up to you.

614
00:59:52,939 --> 00:59:54,270
Not now, Alex.

615
01:00:09,088 --> 01:00:11,488
This is it. I'm flyin' the coup.

616
01:00:13,493 --> 01:00:15,324
I just wanted to say good-bye.

617
01:00:18,731 --> 01:00:20,130
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

618
01:00:21,501 --> 01:00:23,469
- You gonna play it?
- No.

619
01:00:25,638 --> 01:00:26,832
She left it for you.

620
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:30,899
I'll help.

621
01:00:57,303 --> 01:01:00,898
Dr. Marks, Dr. Brace and Hal Abramson
are in the lab.

622
01:01:38,511 --> 01:01:41,002
Maybe it's not a good idea, huh?

623
01:01:46,252 --> 01:01:48,117
I can rewire the output...

624
01:01:49,088 --> 01:01:50,316
...right here.

625
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,718
Disconnect respiration, heart function...

626
01:01:55,495 --> 01:01:57,725
...right here. Give me that case.

627
01:02:01,834 --> 01:02:05,600
Frank, please, get me Bob Jenkins,
Alex Terson...

628
01:02:05,671 --> 01:02:08,435
...Mr. Zimbach and Gordon Forbes,
immediately.

629
01:02:09,709 --> 01:02:10,937
Yes. This is it.

630
01:02:38,971 --> 01:02:40,131
What is it?

631
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,000
What is it?

632
01:02:48,481 --> 01:02:49,709
What's he? Crazy?

633
01:02:49,782 --> 01:02:52,307
We do have a unique opportunity here.

634
01:02:53,753 --> 01:02:55,618
No. I can't authorize this.

635
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,982
This is not the research
we're interested in. This is sick.

636
01:02:58,057 --> 01:03:00,150
I'll take full responsibility, Alex.

637
01:03:00,226 --> 01:03:01,659
There might be something on it
we can use.

638
01:03:01,727 --> 01:03:05,356
The tap will be undetectable,
and Gordon has the necessary experience.

639
01:03:05,431 --> 01:03:07,023
It's on your back, Jim!

640
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,558
This is on your back!

641
01:03:20,012 --> 01:03:21,445
Dr. Marks...

642
01:03:21,781 --> 01:03:23,942
Dr. Brace said something
about rewiring this output.

643
01:03:24,016 --> 01:03:25,984
Something about respiration and...

644
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,111
I know what I'm doing, son.

645
01:03:50,009 --> 01:03:51,943
What's happening to him?

646
01:03:56,148 --> 01:03:57,615
Shut it off, Landon.

647
01:04:00,152 --> 01:04:01,141
Shut it off!

648
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:02,881
Goddamn it, shut it off!

649
01:04:13,666 --> 01:04:14,860
Jesus Christ!

650
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:57,242
You can't do one more.

651
01:05:01,247 --> 01:05:04,080
You can't do it. Not one more.
You can't do it.

652
01:05:15,928 --> 01:05:17,896
- Have a Coke.
- You have a Coke.

653
01:05:25,905 --> 01:05:27,930
No, no. Five minutes, please.

654
01:05:28,074 --> 01:05:29,905
It's important, come on.

655
01:05:32,144 --> 01:05:34,009
One cup of coffee. Come on.

656
01:05:42,488 --> 01:05:44,547
Come on! No, no. Come on!

657
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:46,654
Happy birthday, Lillian.

658
01:05:50,229 --> 01:05:53,062
I gave you two years. I've been fighting
Washington for the last year.

659
01:05:53,132 --> 01:05:56,465
They said it's over. TRIAD is over,
don't you understand, Lillian?

660
01:05:56,535 --> 01:06:00,096
If it were up to me, I would give it to you.
But it's not up to me, babe.

661
01:06:00,172 --> 01:06:01,833
Now I have to go tell Michael.

662
01:06:01,907 --> 01:06:03,875
I've always been with you.
I've always supported you.

663
01:06:03,943 --> 01:06:06,173
I try to support you. What can I do?

664
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:13,418
You don't look so well.

665
01:06:13,919 --> 01:06:16,012
Are things kind of tough for you?

666
01:06:16,088 --> 01:06:18,147
- I'm just tired.
- Tired?

667
01:06:20,092 --> 01:06:21,992
You know I work all the time.

668
01:06:23,462 --> 01:06:25,487
That's the way it's always been.

669
01:06:26,465 --> 01:06:30,299
Do you know, I wonder sometimes
if there isn't something more than that?

670
01:06:31,671 --> 01:06:33,832
More than work? Not to me.

671
01:06:33,973 --> 01:06:37,875
Lillian, I have never broken my word
to you, but I'm sorry, it is dead.

672
01:06:38,711 --> 01:06:41,771
- You don't keep your promises.
- I have never broken my word to you.

673
01:06:41,847 --> 01:06:43,508
I have never broken my word.
I keep my word.

674
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:44,879
We're so close!

675
01:06:45,051 --> 01:06:47,679
Well, I guess I want to believe
there is more.

676
01:06:50,456 --> 01:06:51,684
TRIAD is dead.

677
01:06:51,891 --> 01:06:53,051
I never could.

678
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:54,217
It is dead!

679
01:06:59,465 --> 01:07:01,023
Mike, I'm shutting it off.

680
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:11,836
You're fine.

681
01:07:12,211 --> 01:07:13,235
Chlorothorazine?

682
01:07:13,312 --> 01:07:14,540
It's okay.

683
01:07:16,382 --> 01:07:17,849
I promise.

684
01:07:18,918 --> 01:07:20,044
I love you.

685
01:07:27,026 --> 01:07:29,290
I want these personal experiments
stopped.

686
01:07:29,361 --> 01:07:31,522
You've abused your responsibility.

687
01:07:34,166 --> 01:07:35,997
You've endangered your life.

688
01:07:36,435 --> 01:07:38,266
I want a mind I can use.

689
01:07:38,771 --> 01:07:40,966
I don't want some kind of vegetable.

690
01:07:43,843 --> 01:07:46,141
The idea of playing that tape is sick.

691
01:07:46,712 --> 01:07:48,976
- It makes my skin crawl.
- Where is it?

692
01:07:52,585 --> 01:07:53,916
It's locked away.

693
01:07:54,253 --> 01:07:55,379
Secure.

694
01:07:56,188 --> 01:07:58,622
Alex, I told you, I want to play it out.

695
01:07:58,858 --> 01:08:00,223
You didn't hear me, did you?

696
01:08:00,292 --> 01:08:01,884
Nobody plays that tape.

697
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:03,185
Ever.

698
01:08:16,442 --> 01:08:19,707
When I found her dead, she was beautiful.

699
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:23,405
But why do you have to die to let go?

700
01:08:26,485 --> 01:08:28,953
All my life I've had trouble with people.

701
01:08:29,989 --> 01:08:31,422
I didn't need them.

702
01:08:34,059 --> 01:08:35,822
I always had my own way.

703
01:08:35,995 --> 01:08:37,326
Total confidence.

704
01:08:39,298 --> 01:08:42,699
Now, because of this thing she left me,
this tape...

705
01:08:43,969 --> 01:08:45,197
...I'm scared.

706
01:08:47,907 --> 01:08:49,374
For the first time.

707
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,506
I'm so scared.

708
01:08:54,613 --> 01:08:57,446
But the thing is, I like it. I want more.

709
01:09:01,353 --> 01:09:02,342
Look.

710
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:08,282
You're married to the first man
in the history of the world...

711
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:10,586
...who has the chance
to take a scientific look...

712
01:09:10,663 --> 01:09:13,928
...at the scariest thing
a person ever has to face.

713
01:09:15,301 --> 01:09:18,759
I've got to do it. I've got to play it.
Play that tape.

714
01:09:19,438 --> 01:09:21,235
And you'll have to help me.

715
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,431
But you'll have to promise me...

716
01:09:23,843 --> 01:09:26,038
...that you'll never leave me again.

717
01:09:27,313 --> 01:09:28,905
I'm not going anywhere.

718
01:09:29,048 --> 01:09:30,140
Promise me.

719
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:38,283
It's a deal.

720
01:09:45,664 --> 01:09:47,393
Look at those stars.

721
01:09:48,133 --> 01:09:49,566
Let's go to bed.

722
01:09:50,302 --> 01:09:51,394
Okay.

723
01:10:16,862 --> 01:10:18,830
But if you put the terminal box in here...

724
01:10:18,898 --> 01:10:21,128
...then we won't have any room
for processing.

725
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:23,634
You can put it right next to
the output dial. Right there.

726
01:10:23,702 --> 01:10:26,694
I don't want to see this now.
It's getting, you know...

727
01:10:28,007 --> 01:10:29,372
What are you doing?

728
01:10:30,409 --> 01:10:32,843
Dr. Brace, I'd like to introduce you to...

729
01:10:32,912 --> 01:10:34,880
Stop that. What are you doing?

730
01:10:35,948 --> 01:10:37,540
This is a very valuable piece of equipment.

731
01:10:37,616 --> 01:10:40,141
We felt it should be protected
from unauthorized use.

732
01:10:40,219 --> 01:10:41,447
Who is "we"?

733
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:42,678
Well, the company.

734
01:10:42,755 --> 01:10:44,723
I work here, too. It's my lab.

735
01:10:45,891 --> 01:10:49,759
Alex Terson has authorized me
to clean up after your sloppy work, Brace.

736
01:10:50,429 --> 01:10:52,192
Your notes are impossible to decipher.

737
01:10:52,264 --> 01:10:53,663
Yes, that's right.

738
01:10:55,768 --> 01:10:57,201
We'll figure it out.

739
01:10:57,269 --> 01:10:58,759
No, I don't think so.

740
01:11:00,406 --> 01:11:02,135
Take your hands off that!

741
01:11:02,641 --> 01:11:05,405
You can lock it up,
but you can't make it work!

742
01:11:06,211 --> 01:11:08,236
Get off it! Go on, get off!

743
01:11:09,581 --> 01:11:10,639
All of you, get out!

744
01:11:10,716 --> 01:11:13,446
- You've no right to be here! It's my lab!
- No!

745
01:11:16,288 --> 01:11:17,653
I'm sorry, Mike.

746
01:11:20,993 --> 01:11:21,982
No.

747
01:11:32,071 --> 01:11:33,629
Mind if I take a look?

748
01:11:34,773 --> 01:11:37,503
You know, this security pass
expires tomorrow.

749
01:11:37,609 --> 01:11:39,770
Anyway, Dr. Brace,
you go through the door...

750
01:11:39,845 --> 01:11:42,712
...take a hard hat and a pair of goggles.
- Thanks.

751
01:12:26,525 --> 01:12:30,052
Dr. Brace, please stand clear
of the orange work zone.

752
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:31,117
Hiya, Hal.

753
01:13:31,323 --> 01:13:33,120
Michael. Gosh.

754
01:13:33,692 --> 01:13:36,354
- Hey, it's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

755
01:13:36,562 --> 01:13:38,587
You really had us worried, Mike.

756
01:13:39,898 --> 01:13:41,695
So, playing a lot of golf.

757
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:44,769
That's become a real whore to me.
I can't shake it.

758
01:13:44,937 --> 01:13:46,063
Everything okay?

759
01:13:46,138 --> 01:13:48,038
Let me tell you, it's great.

760
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,767
You know what I always wanted to be?

761
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:52,902
A scientist, just like you guys.

762
01:13:55,447 --> 01:13:57,108
They locked me out, Hal.

763
01:14:00,886 --> 01:14:02,581
I have to get back into the computer.

764
01:14:02,654 --> 01:14:03,951
It's illegal.

765
01:14:04,089 --> 01:14:06,523
Wouldn't want you to get in trouble, Hal.

766
01:14:09,761 --> 01:14:11,194
Hell, I don't care.

767
01:14:13,599 --> 01:14:15,123
Try "Brainstorm. "

768
01:14:15,901 --> 01:14:17,801
It's in the open project file.

769
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:19,762
Brainstorm.

770
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:22,329
Thank you.

771
01:14:22,407 --> 01:14:24,568
I'll do what I can to help you, Mike.

772
01:14:24,643 --> 01:14:25,701
Hey, Mike!

773
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:28,240
Don't be a stranger.

774
01:15:25,304 --> 01:15:27,499
Mr. Jenkins, you better get in here.

775
01:15:49,027 --> 01:15:50,619
Who do you think it is?

776
01:15:51,063 --> 01:15:52,462
I have an idea.

777
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:56,224
Should I cut him off?

778
01:15:58,070 --> 01:16:00,038
No, let's see how far he gets.

779
01:16:00,505 --> 01:16:02,735
See if he's as good as he thinks.

780
01:16:12,451 --> 01:16:14,476
Flight data tape, adhesive tape.

781
01:16:15,587 --> 01:16:17,111
What's file DXO-9?

782
01:16:18,624 --> 01:16:20,421
He knows it's a code.

783
01:16:21,126 --> 01:16:22,718
He's trying to get in.

784
01:16:42,281 --> 01:16:43,339
He's good.

785
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,452
He's in.

786
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:00,221
Son of a bitch!

787
01:17:00,932 --> 01:17:02,263
Dream states?

788
01:17:02,834 --> 01:17:04,062
Trauma.

789
01:17:04,503 --> 01:17:06,801
Physical pain threshold.

790
01:17:10,342 --> 01:17:12,037
Negative memory?

791
01:17:12,411 --> 01:17:14,504
Psychotic episode?

792
01:17:16,782 --> 01:17:18,215
Wait a minute.

793
01:17:34,866 --> 01:17:36,356
What do you want me to do?

794
01:17:36,435 --> 01:17:37,766
Play it for him.

795
01:17:38,503 --> 01:17:39,663
Jimmy, load it up.

796
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:41,399
Hey, whatever you want.

797
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:34,224
In a few moments,
you will have an experience...

798
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:36,556
...which will seem completely real.

799
01:18:37,562 --> 01:18:40,395
It will be the result
of your subconscious fears...

800
01:18:40,499 --> 01:18:43,468
...transformed to
your conscious awareness.

801
01:18:46,037 --> 01:18:49,939
Warning: This tape must not be played
by government personnel.

802
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:54,340
It can be extremely harmful
and result in severe trauma.

803
01:18:56,214 --> 01:18:58,546
You have five seconds
to terminate this tape.

804
01:18:59,885 --> 01:19:04,720
Five... four... three... two... one.

805
01:19:35,887 --> 01:19:37,377
Alex sold us out.

806
01:19:37,756 --> 01:19:38,745
What?

807
01:19:39,090 --> 01:19:41,058
Lillian and I are working away.

808
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:44,518
Alex turns the whole thing over
to some covert operation...

809
01:19:44,596 --> 01:19:46,461
...called Brainstorm Project.

810
01:19:47,265 --> 01:19:50,234
He's taken my work
and turned it into something bad.

811
01:19:50,535 --> 01:19:53,766
Marks and a bunch of his people
are locking everything up.

812
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:55,669
The production line's been retooled...

813
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:57,935
...to make military uses
of the helmet and cord.

814
01:19:58,009 --> 01:20:00,375
And now this can be a code name
Brainstorm...

815
01:20:00,445 --> 01:20:03,141
...which has been a secret project
for the computer for weeks.

816
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:04,682
It's bad, Karen.

817
01:20:05,450 --> 01:20:07,179
I just can't believe it.

818
01:20:07,486 --> 01:20:10,216
I never figured Alex could do
a thing like this.

819
01:20:10,288 --> 01:20:11,778
I can't believe this!

820
01:20:13,024 --> 01:20:15,857
They're using my invention
for brainwashing people.

821
01:20:16,094 --> 01:20:19,427
I just found a tape
of some kind of psychotic episode.

822
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:25,859
If Marks is...

823
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:45,223
You want to see something?

824
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:47,619
I'll show you something.

825
01:20:53,398 --> 01:20:55,525
Now you're gonna find out!

826
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:00,264
It's mine!

827
01:21:03,074 --> 01:21:04,541
What are you doing?

828
01:21:04,876 --> 01:21:07,470
Take that off! Chris?

829
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,643
Don't scare me.

830
01:21:17,355 --> 01:21:19,585
Why don't you just take a seat here.

831
01:21:24,329 --> 01:21:26,991
This boy has had
a serious psychotic break.

832
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:33,862
But he's gonna come out of it, isn't he?
I mean he's gonna be okay?

833
01:21:34,039 --> 01:21:36,803
He'll come out of it. He'll be okay.

834
01:21:38,276 --> 01:21:39,743
I think you oughta go home
and take a rest...

835
01:21:39,811 --> 01:21:43,110
...because we're gonna have to watch him
for two days under sedation.

836
01:21:43,582 --> 01:21:44,776
What do you think?

837
01:21:44,849 --> 01:21:47,147
Nothing like this
is ever gonna happen again.

838
01:21:47,218 --> 01:21:48,947
There you are. Hello, Karen.

839
01:21:49,888 --> 01:21:52,914
Dr. Pederson, this is Dr. Graf
from the Psychiatric Institute.

840
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:55,653
What's the Brainstorm Project, Alex?

841
01:21:56,595 --> 01:21:58,495
Brainstorm? I don't know.

842
01:21:58,797 --> 01:22:01,163
You don't know. Have you seen my kid?

843
01:22:01,399 --> 01:22:03,264
They can't stop him shaking!

844
01:22:04,703 --> 01:22:06,466
- Have you seen, Gordy?
- No.

845
01:22:06,738 --> 01:22:07,830
He's dead.

846
01:22:09,808 --> 01:22:11,833
He monitored that tape, unauthorized.

847
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:13,377
You plugged him in!

848
01:22:13,612 --> 01:22:15,443
I didn't plug him in, Michael.

849
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:18,505
- And I've locked that tape up...
- Nobody locks me out!

850
01:22:19,851 --> 01:22:21,045
You need a rest.

851
01:22:21,119 --> 01:22:22,916
We'll take care of your son.

852
01:22:23,888 --> 01:22:25,378
That tape is mine!

853
01:22:26,157 --> 01:22:27,624
Nobody locks me out!

854
01:22:27,692 --> 01:22:29,626
Mike, listen. He's right.

855
01:22:30,128 --> 01:22:32,722
You've got to get away for a few days.

856
01:22:36,134 --> 01:22:37,692
Sure. Take a rest.

857
01:22:41,006 --> 01:22:43,338
Okay, okay. I'll take a rest.

858
01:23:05,296 --> 01:23:07,321
Good morning.

859
01:23:07,999 --> 01:23:10,092
- How are you today?
- Fine, thanks.

860
01:23:11,302 --> 01:23:14,430
The keys. These two cases.
The metal ones. Be careful.

861
01:23:15,206 --> 01:23:16,867
Thanks a lot. Yeah.

862
01:23:36,561 --> 01:23:38,324
- Little more java?
- I don't want your coffee.

863
01:23:38,396 --> 01:23:40,455
Knock it off, guys.

864
01:23:40,699 --> 01:23:42,098
They're both here.

865
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,397
Okay, fine. Thank you.

866
01:23:55,013 --> 01:23:56,571
I can't believe this. I cannot believe it.

867
01:23:56,648 --> 01:23:59,139
- Just forget about it.
- Well, it just bothers me.

868
01:23:59,217 --> 01:24:01,913
- Just ignore them.
- Why should I ignore them?

869
01:24:02,353 --> 01:24:04,253
We're on vacation, that's why.

870
01:24:04,823 --> 01:24:06,723
He's been doing that all day.

871
01:24:06,925 --> 01:24:08,256
Just ignore him.

872
01:24:09,027 --> 01:24:10,289
I hate this.

873
01:24:16,167 --> 01:24:17,828
What are you staring at?

874
01:24:18,636 --> 01:24:19,694
Mike, forget it!

875
01:24:19,771 --> 01:24:20,829
What?

876
01:24:21,339 --> 01:24:22,897
Can I help you?

877
01:24:23,041 --> 01:24:25,373
Hold your voice down.
Come on, don't make a scene.

878
01:24:25,443 --> 01:24:27,240
Don't do it, Mike!

879
01:24:27,545 --> 01:24:30,070
Wait a minute. I said, can I help you?

880
01:24:33,251 --> 01:24:35,742
Do you want to hear
what we're talking about?

881
01:24:36,354 --> 01:24:37,685
Come sit at the table!

882
01:24:37,756 --> 01:24:40,190
No, wait a minute, just stay right there.

883
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:41,516
Don't push me!

884
01:24:41,593 --> 01:24:43,561
I'm Michael. You wanna know
what we're talking about?

885
01:24:44,395 --> 01:24:45,987
Don't do that!

886
01:24:46,631 --> 01:24:48,428
- You go to hell!
- You go to hell, too.

887
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,762
You go to hell!

888
01:24:50,068 --> 01:24:52,002
- You go to hell, too.
- Don't push me!

889
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:53,537
You go to hell, too!

890
01:24:54,005 --> 01:24:56,030
- You go to hell!
- You go to hell!

891
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:04,007
They had a blowup.

892
01:25:04,382 --> 01:25:05,940
And the woman left in a taxi.

893
01:25:06,017 --> 01:25:07,848
What do you think?

894
01:25:07,986 --> 01:25:09,453
They had a blowup.

895
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:11,716
- Well, stay with Dr. Brace.
- Right.

896
01:25:45,089 --> 01:25:46,283
Hello?

897
01:25:46,357 --> 01:25:47,517
Mike?

898
01:25:48,193 --> 01:25:49,956
I'm glad you called.

899
01:25:50,628 --> 01:25:52,596
I needed to get away and think.

900
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:54,630
Where are you?

901
01:25:54,933 --> 01:25:56,366
I'm at Mother's.

902
01:25:57,202 --> 01:25:59,067
I'm going to stay a few days.

903
01:25:59,737 --> 01:26:02,001
I'll stay with you on the phone then.

904
01:26:03,641 --> 01:26:05,666
Until we work this thing out.

905
01:26:14,118 --> 01:26:15,915
I'm gonna lock the door, Karen.

906
01:26:17,989 --> 01:26:22,016
Starts here at A-32, goes up to Plus-5...

907
01:26:23,328 --> 01:26:25,660
...and then stops here at JO-6.

908
01:26:31,002 --> 01:26:32,765
Karen, what's done is done.

909
01:26:40,678 --> 01:26:42,873
Let's start back at the beginning...

910
01:26:44,482 --> 01:26:46,507
...figure out where we lost it.

911
01:27:03,201 --> 01:27:05,192
I think we might still have a chance.

912
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:06,328
He's in.

913
01:27:07,071 --> 01:27:09,266
I agree. Let's try.

914
01:27:23,421 --> 01:27:24,911
We need to reach out.

915
01:27:26,925 --> 01:27:28,415
Try to connect again.

916
01:27:28,593 --> 01:27:31,585
I wish we didn't have
to do it over the phone.

917
01:27:31,829 --> 01:27:33,592
Maybe this will be easier.

918
01:27:38,202 --> 01:27:39,464
Hello?

919
01:27:39,837 --> 01:27:42,101
You'll probably be glad this happened.

920
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:48,668
Hello?

921
01:29:13,131 --> 01:29:14,655
I'd like to go somewhere.

922
01:29:14,732 --> 01:29:16,757
Maybe we could meet someplace...

923
01:29:17,001 --> 01:29:19,492
...where we had a good time
together before.

924
01:29:19,570 --> 01:29:21,470
You've got a good deal, Mike.

925
01:29:21,639 --> 01:29:23,607
Why don't you tell me a story?

926
01:29:25,109 --> 01:29:26,804
You know, the way we used to?

927
01:29:27,345 --> 01:29:28,676
A story about us.

928
01:29:38,956 --> 01:29:40,048
My work is my life.

929
01:29:40,124 --> 01:29:41,751
We're working for them. It's not up to me!

930
01:29:49,967 --> 01:29:52,959
The girl fell head over heels,
madly in love...

931
01:29:53,271 --> 01:29:55,899
...with a very tall, odd weirdo...

932
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:58,367
...and he was totally impossible.

933
01:29:58,476 --> 01:30:01,639
- Can you turn it up?
- And he was also a genius.

934
01:30:03,781 --> 01:30:05,078
Shut the damn things down!

935
01:30:05,149 --> 01:30:07,515
We can't!
The whole operation's been bypassed.

936
01:30:07,585 --> 01:30:09,416
Must be somebody
who knows the system.

937
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:10,977
All lines are dead.

938
01:30:35,746 --> 01:30:38,010
Door is jammed. I'll go down to security.

939
01:30:40,485 --> 01:30:42,146
Hold it right there.

940
01:31:01,038 --> 01:31:03,734
Here's a transcript
of their conversation so far.

941
01:31:04,642 --> 01:31:06,576
They're still at it.

942
01:31:16,154 --> 01:31:17,917
- What's going on?
- All the doors are stuck.

943
01:31:17,989 --> 01:31:19,479
Everything is locked.

944
01:31:39,877 --> 01:31:42,641
- Bill! You gotta open up!
- Hold on, hold on.

945
01:31:43,681 --> 01:31:45,171
The whole place has gone up for grabs.

946
01:31:45,249 --> 01:31:46,807
Someone has by-passed
the control system.

947
01:31:46,884 --> 01:31:48,977
The production line is going crazy!

948
01:31:52,456 --> 01:31:54,583
Cut Brace's phone. Arrest him.

949
01:31:54,725 --> 01:31:55,783
Okay, sir.

950
01:32:06,003 --> 01:32:09,530
They're on to us. That means
I can't get back to Mike anymore.

951
01:32:09,974 --> 01:32:12,738
But I can still get to the company
on another line.

952
01:33:43,768 --> 01:33:44,826
That guy's nuts!

953
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:51,569
What the hell is happening?

954
01:33:51,642 --> 01:33:54,236
Some guy has snafu'd all the controls.

955
01:34:04,221 --> 01:34:05,916
That's the security code.

956
01:34:11,862 --> 01:34:13,489
That's the control code.

957
01:34:19,470 --> 01:34:21,267
And that should do it.

958
01:35:28,038 --> 01:35:29,665
Okay, so at that time, do that.

959
01:35:29,740 --> 01:35:30,866
- Watches the same?
- Right.

960
01:35:30,941 --> 01:35:32,135
Thanks, you guys.

961
01:35:32,209 --> 01:35:33,904
- I love it!
- Take care.

962
01:35:39,850 --> 01:35:41,875
It won't open!

963
01:35:41,952 --> 01:35:44,420
You, move! Get out of the way!

964
01:35:54,632 --> 01:35:55,894
Shit!

965
01:35:56,934 --> 01:35:59,402
I'll bet they're making phone contacts
with the lab computer.

966
01:35:59,503 --> 01:36:01,300
Have 'em run a trace.

967
01:36:04,241 --> 01:36:05,265
What?

968
01:36:05,443 --> 01:36:07,934
Can you tie into the lab computer
and trace a call?

969
01:36:09,079 --> 01:36:10,740
Master card key won't work.

970
01:36:10,815 --> 01:36:12,476
Well, break it down!

971
01:36:19,356 --> 01:36:20,789
We're inside, Bob.

972
01:36:26,997 --> 01:36:29,227
Get out of the way! I'm gonna try!

973
01:36:43,681 --> 01:36:45,945
Here it is. Five.

974
01:36:46,484 --> 01:36:49,419
I'm sorry, 919...

975
01:36:49,854 --> 01:36:54,223
...555-3820.

976
01:36:55,793 --> 01:36:58,523
Got him. Kill Devil Hills area,
on the outer banks.

977
01:36:58,896 --> 01:37:02,491
Marty? Kill Devil Hills, on the double.
I'll get the exact location for you.

978
01:37:23,521 --> 01:37:25,921
Everyone stand by. We'll have him soon.

979
01:37:32,363 --> 01:37:34,331
He got away from our guys.

980
01:37:57,054 --> 01:37:58,612
Please don't touch it.

981
01:38:24,281 --> 01:38:26,943
Cut it off. Cut it off, Landon.
Don't just stand there.

982
01:38:27,117 --> 01:38:29,017
Cut it off! Cut the power off!

983
01:38:29,086 --> 01:38:30,485
Okay, pull the floor.

984
01:38:33,223 --> 01:38:35,817
Hurry up, come on.
Hurry it up. Hurry it up.

985
01:38:38,429 --> 01:38:41,125
We'll have to go into the floor,
find the main electrical conduits...

986
01:38:49,873 --> 01:38:52,398
0050, and break.

987
01:38:52,843 --> 01:38:54,936
0050, and break.

988
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:02,184
I think we got it.

989
01:39:05,756 --> 01:39:08,623
- We just lost power in the lab, Bob.
- Goddamn him!

990
01:39:09,226 --> 01:39:10,659
Let go, Landon.

991
01:39:12,129 --> 01:39:13,858
Just let go.

992
01:39:27,444 --> 01:39:28,775
Get down!

993
01:39:52,503 --> 01:39:54,528
I'm finished.

994
01:40:10,621 --> 01:40:12,452
Oh, no!

995
01:40:12,623 --> 01:40:15,387
No, no, no!

996
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:44,417
Oh, no! Don't die!

997
01:40:49,727 --> 01:40:52,457
Mike! Oh, God.

998
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:59,166
You promised me!

999
01:41:04,608 --> 01:41:07,805
No! Don't leave me!

1000
01:41:24,394 --> 01:41:28,330
Michael Anthony Brace!

1001
01:41:48,185 --> 01:41:49,880
We made a deal!

1002
01:41:54,224 --> 01:41:56,192
Get up! Michael!

1003
01:41:56,260 --> 01:41:59,195
Get up! Get up! Mike!

1004
01:41:59,797 --> 01:42:01,059
Get up!

1005
01:42:02,933 --> 01:42:04,025
Get up!

1006
01:42:34,865 --> 01:42:36,389
We made it!

1007
01:42:47,244 --> 01:42:49,041
Look at the stars.

1008
01:43:08,265 --> 01:43:09,789
I love you.
