1
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,050
Here I go!

2
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,830
Hm?

3
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,030
Makoto, throw the ball already!

4
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,020
Say, did you hear something just now?

5
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,520
Did you hear?

6
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,730
Hear what?

7
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,680
Huh?

8
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,730
Hey, Makoto!

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,520
Here goes!

10
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,600
There!

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:58,950
Whoa!

12
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,590
Ah, damn it.

13
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,490
Got it!

14
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,310
Yesterday...

15
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,100
My pudding...

16
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,710
I didn't get to eat it.

17
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,800
What's that about pudding?

18
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,260
Your sister probably ate it again.

19
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,510
And I especially saved it for later!

20
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,510
She shouldn't have eaten it... Stupid sister!

21
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,250
Uh-oh, there we go.

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,230
I did it again...

23
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,490
Big sis?

24
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,450
Big sis!

25
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:40,860
Huh?

26
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,540
Makoto! Makoto!

27
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,990
Up! Look up!

28
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,860
Up?

29
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,090
Ouch!

30
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,900
Get up already.

31
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,030
Why did you turn off my alarm?!

32
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,540
You did it yourself. I'm off!

33
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,940
Take care!

34
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,760
Today, July 13th, is known as NICE day.

35
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,710
Oh, no!

36
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,520
What does that mean?

37
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,290
From 7(NAna)-1(Ichi)-3(San), you get NICE(na-i-su).

38
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,930
You're finally up, Makoto?

39
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,130
Morning, Dad.

40
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,270
Mornin'.

41
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,220
I'm off.

42
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,310
Makoto, wait, wait, wait.

43
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,020
What?

44
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,190
Take these to Auntie Witch on the way back. Tell her they're from Grandma.

45
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,070
I don't want to carry this stuff to school!

46
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,180
And also...

47
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,500
Ask her when she's finally going to get married.

48
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,410
Good.

49
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,920
I'm off!

50
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,150
Take care.

51
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,710
Oh, Mako-chan, good morning!

52
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,390
Good morning!

53
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,510
Yeah... Sorry about the ruckus every morning.

54
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:47,770
Chiaki!

55
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,080
Oh, Makoto.

56
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,550
You should give yourself some more time to get to school.

57
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,590
Like you're one to talk!

58
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,130
Slept in again, I bet.

59
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:55,960
Shut up!

60
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,510
What's in the basket?

61
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,710
None of your business!

62
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,180
Why? Tell me!

63
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,920
Barely on time again?

64
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,070
You'd probably feel a lot better if you just came in late.

65
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,560
You're early, Kousuke. Did you forget to jerk off this morning?

66
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,550
Shut up! You guys are just too late.

67
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,570
I wasn't "barely on time". Look.

68
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,750
We're in luck today.

69
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,440
I'm in luck today.

70
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,380
What's that supposed to mean?

71
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,850
"When you're out of luck, nothing goes right". I thought that didn't apply to me.

72
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,960
Since I'm more lucky than not.

73
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,460
Okay, guess why the teacher was late.

74
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,920
A quiz?!

75
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,820
Yes, Hayakawa, correct!

76
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,630
Still, I'm more lucky than not.

77
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,270
I have good luck and intuition.

78
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,310
Thanks to that, my marks aren't too shabby.

79
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,990
I'm not exactly smart, but you couldn't call me stupid.

80
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,920
Five minutes left!

81
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,400
Couldn't call me stupid...

82
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,590
Five minutes left.

83
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,530
That was an exception.

84
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:12,740
[ Tempura ]

85
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,540
I'm not great with my hands, but I'm not clumsy enough to be laughed at.

86
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,030
I also don't make too many blunders that need to be erased from my memory.

87
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,220
What are you doing, stupid! The extinguisher!

88
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,570
Takase-kun, extinguisher!

89
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,570
Y-Yes!

90
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,720
That was also an exception.

91
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,280
Are you okay?

92
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,770
Singed my bangs a bit.

93
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,570
I'm usually pretty careful, so I've never been seriously injured.

94
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,880
The same goes for complex human relations...

95
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,100
H-Hey!

96
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,290
Aw geez!

97
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,200
What the heck is this!

98
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,840
Why you!

99
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,030
I don't think blood-type fortune telling matters here.

100
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,180
But it says extremely bad luck. Isn't that risky?

101
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,530
She's the one who gets to decide if it's risky or not.

102
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,350
[ Try harder ]

103
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,190
Try harder

104
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,110
Makoto.

105
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,990
What?

106
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,000
Did you decide between sciences or humanities?

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,450
Not yet. You?

108
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,300
Nope.

109
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,790
That's good.

110
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,030
Can't make up your mind right away, yeah?

111
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,070
Who knows what'll happen in the future?

112
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,500
It never ends...

113
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,800
Hey, Makoto!

114
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,710
How long are you gonna be?

115
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,520
Why don't you help then?

116
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,970
Yeah, right.

117
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,860
Hurry up!

118
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,320
What will Chiaki-kun go with?

119
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,580
Probably sciences. He can't read kanji.

120
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,520
He's amazing at math.

121
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,540
And only math.

122
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,540
And why are we talking about him?

123
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:10,680
Hey, the questionnaires are still here! Who's on duty today?

124
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,670
Who is it?

125
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,900
You, of course!

126
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,110
What a pain...

127
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,510
"Time waits for no-"

128
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,650
Huh?

129
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,200
Hm?

130
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,940
I thought someone was here...

131
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,230
A locked room mystery...

132
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,360
What's that...

133
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,630
You're such a moron. My stomach hurts!

134
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,340
You're laughing way too hard.

135
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,780
Yeah, you are.

136
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,400
But it's hilarious!

137
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,650
It's not.

138
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,880
Want to get a CT scan at our hospital?

139
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,890
I'm fine.

140
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,710
Be careful. Something might happen again.

141
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,890
It won't. I won't have it.

142
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,630
But stuff doesn't usually fall on its own, yeah?

143
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,270
It didn't fall on its own! Someone was there!

144
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,120
Someone?

145
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,980
Who?

146
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,210
You?...

147
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,610
Why would I knock you over?

148
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,750
You?...

149
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,190
So I'm the culprit now?

150
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,030
Then who?

151
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,590
Man, it's hot.

152
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,810
It's almost summer break. Hang in there.

153
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,990
That's right! Summer break! The three of us should go somewhere!

154
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,450
Like where?

155
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,730
Let's go to a night game.

156
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,730
We just went last month. You only have baseball in your head.

157
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,760
Where then?

158
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,930
Like the beach.

159
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,070
It's too hot.

160
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,310
Then fireworks. In yukatas!

161
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,580
I don't have one.

162
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,580
Kousuke, where do you want to go?

163
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:55,950
The library.

164
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,890
To study hard.

165
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,490
If you keep studying in this heat, you'll go crazy.

166
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,330
You guys slack too much.

167
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,420
We're not trying to get into med school or anything.

168
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,910
So what are you going to do?

169
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,420
A hotel tycoon.

170
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,710
Or maybe an oil magnate.

171
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,500
Be serious about it!

172
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,880
Say.

173
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,530
What are you going to do, Chiaki?

174
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,230
Me?

175
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,990
I'll...

176
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,600
You two should do some serious thinking.

177
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:33,750
Going home?

178
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,750
Gotta run some errands for Mom.

179
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,040
Don't be like that. You're leaving me alone with this guy?

180
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,500
Bye. See you.

181
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,440
Hey. Hey!

182
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,580
Come on.

183
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,040
The dwarves are about to pop up!

184
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,690
Sheesh.

185
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,500
Hey! Are you blind or something?!

186
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,040
I'm sorry!

187
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,970
If today...

188
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:14,020
If today were a normal day, there wouldn't have been any problems.

189
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,990
But...

190
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,480
I'd forgotten that today was an extremely unlucky day.

191
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,160
It's crazy... but I'm going to die.

192
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,940
This is it.

193
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,860
If I had known, I would have gotten up earlier.

194
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,050
I wouldn't have slept in. Wouldn't have been late.

195
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,030
Done a better job on my tempura.

196
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,090
Avoid being knocked over by stupid boys.

197
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,140
And today was supposed to be NICE day...

198
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,420
Hey! Are you blind or something?!

199
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:39,190
Apologize! Apologize this very instant!

200
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:42,900
I'm sorry!

201
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:48,130
Do you know why you've got eyes on the front of your head? To see where're you going! Got it?!

202
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,240
Yes! I'm very sorry.

203
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,140
Honestly, sheesh...

204
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,720
Mama, look!

205
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,600
Oh, it's already that late.

206
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:10,930
How...?

207
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:15,890
How?!

208
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,220
Yes.

209
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,460
Yoshiyama-san.

210
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,810
Don't be so anxious, she'll be here soon.

211
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,950
Makoto!

212
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,980
Auntie!

213
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,220
Auntie Witch!

214
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,590
Am I alive? I'm alive, right?

215
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,080
I don't look strange anywhere, right?!

216
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,410
Your bangs look strange.

217
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,230
That was a time leap.

218
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,900
Time leap?!

219
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,510
You were about to be hit by a train?

220
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,150
You were thrown off your bike?

221
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,880
But before you knew it, you'd gone back to a slightly earlier time.

222
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,610
Yes!

223
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,100
That's a time leap.

224
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,710
Time is irreversible, you know.

225
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,050
Irreversible?

226
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,330
You can't reverse the flow of time.

227
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,940
Which means that you were the one who went back in time.

228
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,990
You traveled through time and returned to the past.

229
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:51,960
Really?

230
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:57,270
It's not that rare. Many girls do it at your age.

231
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,120
No, no, no way. Never.

232
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,120
It happened to me, too.

233
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,710
For real?!

234
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,710
For example, on Sunday I would sleep in late.

235
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,960
And then I'd think, "I don't feel like doing anything today," you know?

236
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:18,130
And before I knew it, it was already night. That gave me a start!

237
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,100
Where did my precious Sunday go?

238
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,940
Listen seriously. I'm being serious here.

239
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,760
Aren't you glad you're alive?

240
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,160
Try to look a little happier?

241
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:40,630
Hey.

242
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,210
Help me here.

243
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,620
Yes.

244
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,090
Show me how you did it.

245
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,700
As if I could!

246
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,370
If you learn the trick, you can do it again.

247
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,220
I can't, I tell you!

248
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,000
But you actually leaped, didn't you?

249
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,290
Like this?

250
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,580
Yes. Hold it there.

251
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,660
What? Earthquake?

252
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,290
Big sis, no! Don't!

253
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,290
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was all my fault.

254
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,360
Why are you doing this? Because I ate your pudding?

255
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,110
Wh-Why what?

256
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,180
Big sis, don't die!

257
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,670
I won't.

258
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,540
Where are you going?

259
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,370
To the convenience store!

260
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,150
If you want pudding, I'll go buy it for you,

261
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,620
No need. Don't worry.

262
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,530
Are you mad?

263
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,290
I'm not.

264
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,520
You really aren't?

265
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,950
Yes, really.

266
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:27,520
Damn!

267
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,980
Awesome!

268
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,580
It's impossible to travel through time.

269
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,740
You can't just leap. No way.

270
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,450
I could never do something like that.

271
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,360
Here I...

272
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:26,410
...go!

273
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,910
Ouch, ouch!

274
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,690
Where am I?

275
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,170
Oh, back home.

276
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,800
Pudding...

277
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,090
My pudding's here. Which means...

278
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,430
Tuesday, July 12th.

279
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,060
Today, Japanese Standard Time...

280
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,330
Wasn't there some pudding?

281
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,350
Can I have it?

282
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,490
Isn't it your sister's?

283
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:55,290
She'll probably have something to eat with Kousuke-kun and Chiaki-kun.

284
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,750
I can? Yay!

285
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,210
No, you can't! It's mine!

286
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,640
Makoto?

287
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,030
You're home?

288
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,930
Ouch...

289
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,070
The pudding! Where is it?

290
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,670
Gone...

291
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,310
You saw?

292
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,340
Yeah, I saw!

293
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,800
Eh, what is it?

294
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,220
That girl just did an awesome jump.

295
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,280
She sure did.

296
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,870
And she disappeared for a moment.

297
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,170
How could she do that?

298
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,860
He's starting to tell tales again.

299
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,770
I'm not lying! I saw it!

300
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,960
Did I... leap?

301
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,650
Great!

302
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,840
This...

303
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,390
This...

304
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,550
...is not a dream.

305
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,670
I can leap. I can!

306
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,210
I'm off!

307
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,010
Take care!

308
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,340
Take care.

309
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,400
What time is it?!

310
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,220
Why?

311
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:42,230
So, why is today, July 13th, known as NICE day?

312
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,840
Good morning!

313
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,630
Morning!

314
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,990
Good morning!

315
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,710
Mornin'.

316
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,290
Morning!

317
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:09,460
Huh?

318
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,310
Barely on time again?

319
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,050
You'd probably feel a lot better if you just came in late.

320
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,950
You're early, Kousuke. Did you forget to jerk off this morn-

321
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,680
Stop babbling. Make sure you wake up early.

322
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,050
What? Why are you early today?

323
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,690
I'm done!

324
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,490
Takase-kun.

325
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,510
Let's switch groups.

326
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,210
Sure, but why?

327
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,570
Don't panic! Turn off the gas!

328
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,970
Takase-kun, extinguisher!

329
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:53,900
Y-Yes!

330
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,000
Takase, you jerk! I'll remember that!

331
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,900
Sorry...

332
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,780
Say, about Chiaki-kun...

333
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,670
I don't have time for that right now.

334
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,140
What?

335
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,630
Y-You okay?

336
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,500
[ Excellent! ]

337
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,500
Makoto, did you decide between sciences or humanities?

338
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,510
Maybe I should try going overseas.

339
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,150
What's that?

340
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,470
Like a student exchange or something?

341
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,810
What are you saying? You failed the English level 3!

342
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:39,060
Aw, come on. Time waits for no one!

343
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,090
Hey, Makoto!

344
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,500
Yo!

345
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,680
A melon soda and two colas.

346
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,110
Why karaoke instead of baseball?

347
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,500
We can do that after karaoke.

348
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,800
I refuse to follow a tight schedule.

349
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,920
Time waits for no one, time waits for no one...

350
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:02,400
Time waits for no one, time waits for no one...

351
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,780
Yes.

352
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,360
Your time is up in five minutes.

353
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,540
We'll be leaving then.

354
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,310
Time's up?

355
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,290
A melon soda and two colas.

356
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,230
Why karaoke instead of baseball?

357
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,030
What're you doing, Makoto?

358
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,020
Nothing.

359
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,160
Actually, I tripped.

360
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,590
Tripped how? And weren't you sitting here a second ago?!

361
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,700
Who cares. Sing on!

362
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:31,320
Time waits for no one, time waits for no one...

363
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,350
Yes.

364
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,020
Your time is up in five minutes.

365
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,730
We'll...

366
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,410
Yes, we'll be leaving then...

367
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:32,940
Not!

368
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,620
What're you doing, Makoto?

369
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:38,910
I tripped.

370
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,260
Tripped how? And weren't you sitting here a second ago?!

371
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,730
I'm not done yet! I'm gonna sing a hundred songs!

372
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:51,400
Ah, excuse me. A melon soda, a cola and a ginger ale.

373
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,450
I'm back...

374
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,600
What happened to your voice?

375
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,730
Karaoke.

376
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,050
How much did you sing to do that to your voice?

377
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,760
About ten hours.

378
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,390
Don't be ridiculous.

379
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,280
I'm beat... What's for dinner?

380
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,360
Chicken stew.

381
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,330
Let's do teppanyaki or something!

382
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,870
We had it the day before yesterday.

383
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,840
Come on, teppanyaki!

384
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,500
Stop moaning. How about coming home earlier and helping?

385
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,710
W-What happened?

386
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,290
Nothing.

387
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:29,270
This is it! Let's dig in!

388
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,620
How do you catch my batted balls?! Damn!

389
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,740
Yeah, how do you catch them with that form?

390
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,950
Again?!

391
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,750
How can you read my pitches?!

392
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,080
There's nothing I can't read!

393
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,160
I can see it all!

394
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,550
One person will win every time!

395
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,120
À Tes Souhaits? That's quite a treat.

396
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,470
Don't worry. It's to show my appreciation for all the advice you've given.

397
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,700
Even if I use up my allowance...

398
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:28,360
...I can just return to the day I get my allowance!

399
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,380
This way, I haven't spent a penny!

400
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,230
Really, I can come and go as I please.

401
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:37,310
I can sleep all I want in the morning, I don't have to go back when I forget something...

402
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,870
...and I don't need to finish a buffet in 90 minutes!

403
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:44,410
Oh, if you ever miss a TV show, let me know. I'll tape it for you.

404
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:45,360
I'm glad.

405
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,410
Why?

406
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,850
Looks like you're not using it for anything important.

407
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,490
No way!

408
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:54,730
Time leaping is the best! I just can't quit.

409
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:58,710
Every day is so much fun! I can't stop laughing!

410
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,410
When you're enjoying yourself, doesn't that mean somebody else is suffering as a result?

411
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,660
Does it?

412
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,950
Who knows.

413
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,970
This is good.

414
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,700
It doesn't! It's fine. Whatever happens, I can just go back!

415
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,180
I can reset as many times as I want.

416
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:37,130
What's this? You've got extremely good luck today! You won't get another chance like this until next year!

417
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,020
You decided to do it today, right?

418
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,440
Break a leg!

419
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,160
What if she really does?

420
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,560
Senpai!

421
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,440
Me?

422
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,160
No.

423
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,210
Um, it's...

424
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,690
Kaho!

425
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,630
We're going!

426
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,480
Yeah!

427
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,590
What do they want?

428
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,190
Just go.

429
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,900
Stop throwing like a girl!

430
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,920
Throw with your shoulder. Your shoulder!

431
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,590
Hey.

432
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,170
You're late!

433
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,590
Sorry.

434
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,120
Um...

435
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,710
Those girls? Underclassmen from the volunteer club.

436
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,950
What'd they want?

437
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,310
Well...

438
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,590
They asked if we're dating.

439
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,090
We're not, right?

440
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,300
That's what I said.

441
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,180
And? What then?

442
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,820
I'm not really sure...

443
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,550
...but I guess I was asked out.

444
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,080
Way to go!

445
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,110
For real?!

446
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:40,960
So what'd you say?

447
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,260
"I can't".

448
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,180
How mean!

449
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,480
Hey now!

450
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,030
After she confessed?!

451
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:50,260
Why'd you turn her down?! I'd definitely date her!

452
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,550
Listen here...

453
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:55,000
Doesn't she look like the girl you liked in junior high?

454
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,610
She doesn't!

455
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:02,770
It'll be too late if you change your mind later!

456
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,890
Stop talking about it already.

457
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,140
Bye.

458
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,080
Yeah.

459
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,670
Hm? Where's your bike?

460
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,720
A little something...

461
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,530
Hop on the back.

462
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,760
You're giving me a ride? Lucky!

463
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,720
I wonder if he's really not interested.

464
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,710
When he says no, he means it.

465
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,560
I'm a bit relieved.

466
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,570
Why?

467
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,940
If he got a girlfriend, he would take good care about her.

468
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,340
That's how he is.

469
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,490
Then he couldn't play baseball.

470
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,150
You can't call catch playing baseball...

471
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:57,090
Somehow I thought the three of us would be together forever...

472
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:03,540
Kousuke would scold me for being late, and you would make fun of me for not catching the ball...

473
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,800
Makoto.

474
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,000
Want to...

475
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,280
...go out with me?

476
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,450
Stop.

477
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,920
Stop for a sec.

478
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,320
What's that?

479
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,480
What did you just say?

480
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,550
Let's go out.

481
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,430
Where did this come from?

482
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,280
From the "what if Kousuke got a girlfriend".

483
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,440
I'm... not that ugly, right?

484
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,290
You serious?

485
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,360
Serious.

486
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,160
W-W-Wait a minute!

487
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,680
What is it now?

488
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,240
Makoto?

489
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,400
What the hell are you doing?

490
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,070
Nothing.

491
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:35,530
It'll be too late if you change your mind later!

492
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,380
Stop talking about it already.

493
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:38,820
Bye.

494
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,840
Yeah.

495
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,530
Hm? Where's your bike?

496
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,260
Hop on the back.

497
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,350
That Kousuke beat me to it!

498
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:56,290
It's not like he actually got a girlfriend.

499
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:00,650
That's what you say now, but once he gets a girl, he'll put her first.

500
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,170
You can't be sure.

501
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:05,980
Damn, with him gone, we can only play catch.

502
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:10,130
Like I said, why don't hold off on the speculating until he actually gets a girlfriend?

503
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:12,700
Maybe it would be for the best.

504
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,730
In that case... want to go out?

505
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,810
Where did this-

506
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:25,400
That's what you say now, but once he gets a girl, he'll put her first.

507
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,280
B-By the way, my sister is such an idiot!

508
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,200
I'm talking about Kousuke!

509
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,250
Let's talk about my sister!

510
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,580
If Kousuke got a girlfriend...

511
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,170
My sister was-

512
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,000
Want to date me?!

513
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:45,600
It'll be too late if you change your mind later.

514
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:48,210
Stop talking about it already.

515
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,970
Huh? Makoto, get on.

516
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:52,640
I'm fine.

517
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,140
Hey, what's with you all of a sudden?

518
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,080
What's with her?

519
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,590
Must be your fault!

520
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,570
Why?!

521
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:09,440
I thought that you liked Chiaki-kun.

522
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,820
You think that you have to take care of him since he's a joker, right?

523
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,830
Well, I did say that before, but...

524
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,850
Why did you undo it? You could just go out with him.

525
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,180
No, no, no, no.

526
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,180
Why?

527
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:26,150
I totally can't imagine being anything but friends with Chiaki.

528
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,930
If it didn't work out, you could just go back to before you started going out.

529
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,740
You can do that, right?

530
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,510
There's no need for that.

531
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:35,450
It's also possible to fall in love after you've been confessed to.

532
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:37,330
That'll NEVER happen!

533
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:40,440
Yes... Because you undid it.

534
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,830
Poor Chiaki... He worked so hard to tell you how he felt.

535
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,390
But he has no idea, huh?

536
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:00,290
Chiaki-kun transferred to our school this spring, right?

537
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,570
He went through a bunch of schools, right?

538
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:04,530
Sounds like it.

539
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,030
Is it true that he returned from abroad?

540
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,170
Nope.

541
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,790
He's too dumb.

542
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:11,570
So it's not...

543
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,320
Totally.

544
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,810
I wonder if something happened at his previous school.

545
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:16,380
Why don't you ask him?

546
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,970
I don't know his e-mail.

547
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,630
You're in the same class!

548
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,970
You're such good friends with him.

549
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,830
I'm not gonna ask that.

550
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,830
And we're not that close.

551
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:26,660
Liar.

552
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,320
Nuh-uh, I tell you.

553
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,840
Stop it!

554
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:42,260
They're getting him back for the extinguisher.

555
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,100
Stop that!

556
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:49,730
Who is it?

557
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,230
It's Mamiya!

558
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,590
Not done yet?

559
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,270
See you, Takase!

560
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,250
Bye!

561
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,150
Man, you're dripping wet.

562
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,750
Takase-kun, are you all right?

563
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:12,410
Yesterday they splashed cola on me, so I returned the favor with some coffee milk.

564
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:15,470
If you do that, they'll keep bullying you, right?

565
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,930
Hey, Makoto!

566
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:22,470
Did you see yesterday's nighter? Saito puts on some mad pressure!

567
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,730
You looked away just now.

568
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,040
I didn't.

569
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,940
What are you up to?

570
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,960
Nothing.

571
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,730
Just spit it out. What are you up to?

572
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,360
I said nothing!

573
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,860
What's wrong?

574
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:46,040
Konno, you...

575
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:50,470
Why did you ask me to fry tempura that time?!

576
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,160
Ah, no... I couldn't have known that...

577
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,880
It's your fault, stupid!

578
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,590
Who's stupid? Keep complaining and I'll throw this!

579
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,470
Hey!

580
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,840
Yeah, throw it!

581
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,750
Sorry, it sorta slipped.

582
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,110
Stupid!

583
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,480
What a rude guy. Calling others stupid?

584
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,980
You call me stupid all the time.

585
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,690
In my case, it's a term of endearment.

586
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:25,160
Come on, where's the comeback? Don't leave me hangin'.

587
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,450
Isn't she out of sorts today? Don't you think, Hayakawa-san?

588
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,680
You are absolutely right.

589
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,660
Why so formal?

590
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,360
Ah, well, we haven't really talked much...

591
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,460
Makoto!

592
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:21,770
She's not here.

593
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,620
Why isn't she?

594
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,520
Did something happen?

595
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,120
No, nothing.

596
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,420
You probably pissed her off over something stupid.

597
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,620
Don't say she has huge feet or whatever. She's sensitive about it.

598
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,070
I said nothing happened!

599
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:36,850
Nothing!

600
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,510
Nothing, right?

601
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,580
Throw it already!

602
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,940
I can't throw while I'm thinking!

603
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,380
No good.

604
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,780
I don't get it!

605
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,610
Oh, it's from Yuri.

606
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:25,810
[ Today something really great happened! What should I do? ]

607
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:25,390
"Something really great happened."

608
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,960
Something great?

609
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,600
[ What, what happened? Tell me! ]

610
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:39,980
Yes.

611
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,240
Wait a second.

612
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:56,100
What was that...

613
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,270
Hurry up, or they'll be sold out.

614
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,290
Today I don't really feel too well...

615
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,910
No way. Wanna go to the nurse's office?

616
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,390
No, I'm fine.

617
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,770
Hey, hurry up! That's quite a sight!

618
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,940
Stop it, Takase!

619
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:58,480
You're the ones who didn't stop when I told you to!

620
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,040
We're sorry!

621
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,610
If you're sorry, then you shouldn't have done this in the first place!

622
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:03,850
This is dangerous.

623
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,460
Did anyone go tell the teachers?

624
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,040
Hey, look there!

625
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:10,540
Takase-kun, stop it! Takase-kun!

626
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,790
Konno!

627
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,170
You just gave me an order, didn't you?!

628
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,170
I-I didn't!

629
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:23,000
You did!

630
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,570
What?

631
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,920
Why? Damn, dammit!

632
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,490
Damn it all!

633
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,030
Stop it!

634
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:38,770
Takase!

635
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:40,320
S-S-Sto-

636
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:43,150
Takase!

637
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,210
Chiaki!

638
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,960
Chiaki!

639
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,430
Whoa, that was a really bad sound.

640
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:18,410
What year are you in?

641
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:19,600
Quickly, get a teacher!

642
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,340
Where's a teacher?

643
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:23,430
I'm not my fault! I... I...!

644
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:25,740
Yuri! Yuri?

645
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:24,910
Are you all right?!

646
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,630
Don't cry. It's not that serious.

647
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,180
What if it leaves a scar?

648
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,470
Then I'll do something about it.

649
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,470
Something?

650
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,060
I'll do something.

651
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,500
No boys.

652
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,590
Does it hurt?

653
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,640
Let me see.

654
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:12,730
No.

655
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:13,570
Just do it.

656
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,420
Thanks.

657
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:26,530
I'm sorry, really!

658
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,500
Why?

659
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,300
I mean, I'm sorry, really.

660
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:34,390
For real, who goes to a nighter on the first date!

661
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:38,880
Weren't the three of us supposed to go together? I was looking forward to it!

662
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:42,160
That's why I said I'm sorry!

663
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,710
Hayakawa-san was okay with a nighter.

664
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,470
So you're going out?

665
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:47,410
Of course.

666
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:51,960
You okay, Makoto?

667
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,870
For real?

668
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:54,080
I can't?

669
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:01,450
But yeah, Yuri-chan understands my hobbies.

670
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:03,500
Lucky you!

671
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,670
Hey, stupid! Look where you threw it!

672
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,000
I'm home.

673
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:18,510
Hm, where's dinner?

674
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:19,730
I'm making it right now.

675
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:20,520
Why?

676
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,040
Big sis ate everything.

677
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:23,940
Geez!

678
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:28,600
What is this? After he said he liked me!

679
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,740
I was about to die...

680
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:53,850
What is this?

681
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,960
Ninety?

682
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:16,970
Makoto!

683
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,190
Let me go!

684
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:21,940
We've been had.

685
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,110
Totally duped.

686
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,800
The world is full of lies.

687
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,780
Wait! Wait for me!

688
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:27,450
Hurry up!

689
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,840
We can only play catch like this.

690
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,060
I'm gonna drag Chiaki here tomorrow.

691
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,620
That would be unfair to Yuri.

692
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:41,720
If I tell him you're feeling lonely, he'll definitely come.

693
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,290
I'm not especially lonely.

694
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:48,760
He didn't go with Hayakawa because you turned him down?

695
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,980
I didn't turn him down!

696
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,880
Oh?

697
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,670
What's that "oh" for?!

698
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,070
Good grief.

699
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,590
Why don't you get a girlfriend?

700
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,990
If I get a girlfriend, you'll be all alone.

701
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:12,490
I thought you liked Kousuke-kun.

702
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,360
He's the one who always helps you when you're in trouble, right?

703
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:19,050
He's like that with everyone.

704
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,260
Go out with him.

705
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:22,830
How did you come to that solution?

706
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:27,020
You know... If it doesn't work out, you can just go back to before.

707
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,050
I'll never do that.

708
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,060
Why?

709
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,920
Playing with the feelings of others...

710
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,900
Is too cruel for you?

711
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:40,440
Isn't that what you've been doing because you wanted to try going back in time.

712
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:43,150
That's how you saw it?

713
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,030
I guess.

714
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,150
You're a witch.

715
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,770
You really are Auntie Witch.

716
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,570
This painting...

717
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:58,860
You noticed?

718
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:02,120
Yes, the one you've been restoring since forever.

719
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:11,520
It's a mysterious painting. If you look at it for a long time, you feel completely at peace.

720
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:20,670
We don't know its artist, or whether it even has any artistic value.

721
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:25,030
But... we learned one thing during the restoration.

722
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:31,770
This painting was drawn hundreds years ago in a time of war and famine.

723
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:39,680
Why did someone draw this painting when the world was on the verge of destruction?

724
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:24,280
What will you do, Konno? You're the only one who hasn't turned in a course plan yet.

725
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:26,650
Konno.

726
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,110
Konno.

727
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:31,440
Konno!

728
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,170
Yes!

729
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:35,720
Don't get carried away just because you did well on the test.

730
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,910
Yes!

731
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,470
Strange...

732
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:50,020
It was ninety the other day.

733
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,920
Yes, go ask her.

734
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,040
Um, but...

735
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:56,820
What?

736
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,650
W-W-Wait!

737
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:00,490
Whatwhatwhatwhat?

738
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:04,010
Konno-senpai, we're from the volunteer club.

739
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:06,290
We have a serious question to ask you.

740
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:07,980
I-It's nothing!

741
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,840
Lately, you and Kousuke-senpai...

742
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,640
...are together all the time, right?

743
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,360
Well...

744
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,050
Stop!

745
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:15,710
Are you going out, after all?

746
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:16,970
Are you?

747
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:18,400
Are you?!

748
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:27,510
It was back when I was still in junior high.

749
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:34,250
The volunteer club from Kuranose high school came to the retirement home where my grandma was.

750
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:41,750
Grandma really liked one of the members, and told me about him many times.

751
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:48,650
"He's a very kind and wonderful person," she would repeat again and again.

752
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:57,950
After hearing that so many times, I came to like him even though I'd never met him.

753
00:50:57,950 --> 00:50:59,660
What a beautiful story.

754
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:05,710
After I entered high school, I learned that his name was Tsuda Kousuke.

755
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,680
So stuff like that really happens...

756
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,800
But, as you see, she's very shy.

757
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,010
So we were urging her to act.

758
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:17,880
The other day we finally got her to confess.

759
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,010
Oh, the other day.

760
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:21,020
Kousuke-senpai said...

761
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,970
"I already have someone I like."

762
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:28,500
"So I'm sorry but I can't go out with you."

763
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,880
Oh, um, well...

764
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,080
It wasn't anything like that.

765
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:35,120
"Someone who's usually stupid got better grades than me."

766
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:38,040
"I can't afford to slack off, so..."

767
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:40,560
"I'm very sorry, but..."

768
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,790
That "someone stupid" can't be... me?!

769
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,680
And then Kousuke-senpai said...

770
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,460
...that he's not going out with you!

771
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,640
But what is it with you two lately?

772
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,770
It's like the total opposite?!

773
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:58,380
Please explain yourself!

774
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,160
W-W-Wait a minute!

775
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,350
I got it. I got it!

776
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:06,160
I'll do something about it.

777
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,450
Something?

778
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:09,200
Something...?

779
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:10,780
Something!

780
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:24,010
Ouch!

781
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,580
What's with her?

782
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:33,190
Um, it's...

783
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,760
Kaho!

784
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,690
Um...

785
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:39,880
Kousuke!

786
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:48,060
Huh? Didn't you go to the field?

787
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:55,270
More importantly, her grandma said that she's really grateful for your help in retirement house.

788
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:57,010
Way to go, Kousuke! And then...

789
00:52:57,010 --> 00:53:00,750
W-W-Why do you know my grandma?

790
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:04,640
How? I, ah, met her in the bowling alley...

791
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:05,640
She's confined to bed!

792
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,220
Ah, not there-

793
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,980
Call me when you're done talking.

794
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,360
W-Wait, Kousuke!

795
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:19,400
One more try!

796
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:26,540
Ouch!

797
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:29,390
Um, it's...

798
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,580
Kousuke!

799
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:38,290
Huh? Didn't you go-

800
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,290
Wait!

801
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:42,620
First of all, you're a coward! Don't be jealous of my good grades!

802
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,450
And that's got nothing to do with this, okay?

803
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:48,430
Why are you popping out of nowhere to brag? And it's got nothing to do with what?!

804
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:53,130
Like I said, my grades have nothing to do with Kaho-chan liking you!

805
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:54,630
Y-You're wrong.

806
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:56,590
You're wrong!

807
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:58,390
W-Wait, Kaho-chan!

808
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,040
You're wrong, she says.

809
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:01,700
Kousuke, wait!

810
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:07,030
What?!

811
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:12,780
I have to start with something more basic...

812
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,760
Big sis, why are you messing around so early?

813
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,780
Went back too far! And I'm late, to boot!

814
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,260
Makoto, the peaches!

815
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,470
Peaches!

816
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:46,730
Good grief.

817
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,940
Oh-oh, it's a headlock!

818
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,410
No good!

819
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:53,860
What was that?

820
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,210
Awesome.

821
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:56,800
Don't look. Carry on!

822
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:58,620
You all, get away.

823
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:00,410
Kaho!

824
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,800
I don't really get it, but she said to come to the courtyard.

825
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:05,970
Who did?

826
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:09,410
Where are we going? What do you want from me?

827
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:10,680
You'll know once we get there.

828
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,750
Makoto...

829
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:12,760
Later.

830
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,800
I give up, give up!

831
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,890
"Come to the courtyard"... for this?

832
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:18,030
No idea...

833
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:19,770
Fly!

834
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:22,100
There!

835
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:30,230
Ouch...

836
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,190
What the hell are you doing?

837
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:35,350
It hurts.

838
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:38,200
Oh, crap!

839
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:40,440
Can you stand?

840
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:44,390
Did you sprain it?

841
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:45,960
I'm fine.

842
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:47,960
No, you're not.

843
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,410
Kousuke-senpai!

844
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:50,820
Lean on me.

845
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,810
T-Thank you.

846
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:55,260
This is quite a development.

847
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:56,980
Could it be...?

848
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:59,500
It most certainly could be...

849
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,510
All right!

850
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:04,260
I feel like I did a good thing!

851
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,710
What is this feeling of happiness?

852
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,440
It changed again!

853
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:12,180
Ten?

854
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,110
Ten means...

855
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:18,470
One?

856
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:23,440
No one's here. Am I too early?

857
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:34,940
Here we go...

858
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:50,310
Excuse me! Can I ask something?

859
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,470
Yuri?

860
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,590
I thought someone was here...

861
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,010
Why?

862
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:03,750
I brought the questionnaires for you. Did you forget that you're on duty today?

863
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:05,560
Oh, right.

864
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:09,390
I knew it. Really, you should appreciate our friendship!

865
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:11,860
So, what was your question?

866
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,760
Ah, it's nothing.

867
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,430
I see.

868
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:20,540
Yuri...

869
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,550
You didn't see anyone on your way here?

870
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:24,950
Anyone?

871
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:27,120
No, never mind.

872
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,780
I see.

873
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:39,610
[ Looks like I got confessed to. Aren't you jealous? ]

874
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,030
Kousuke?

875
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:38,600
"Looks like I got confessed to."

876
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:40,550
[ I'm borrowing your bike. Tsuda Kousuke. ]

877
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:43,600
Sheesh, who do you think you need to thank for that?

878
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,600
[ I'm borrowing your bike. Tsuda Kousuke. ]

879
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,560
[ your bike ]

880
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,220
No way...

881
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:53,880
Ma...

882
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:55,550
ko...

883
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:57,570
to... there.

884
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,120
Where's your house?

885
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,310
Past the station in the south district.

886
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:03,030
We better drop by a clinic.

887
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:05,780
Our home one is nearby.

888
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,450
By the way, Makoto...

889
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:12,660
...on the way here I met...

890
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:16,060
...Chiaki-kun.

891
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,080
Kousuke!

892
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:22,760
He went home.

893
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,640
Yeah, holding that first-year's hand.

894
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:28,640
Gone!

895
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:36,980
Kousuke?

896
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:38,510
It's me.

897
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:41,960
Look, Dad, can you treat a sprain?

898
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,680
No, it's not me.

899
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:46,040
Yeah, now.

900
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,950
Thank you.

901
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:50,490
Leave your message after-

902
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:51,040
Damn!

903
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,280
What should I do? Go back in time?

904
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:09,420
But it's not like anything happened yet...

905
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:04,190
E-Excuse me...

906
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:06,950
There wasn't a bike accident here?

907
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:10,280
No... I don't think so.

908
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:11,710
Thank you.

909
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:14,790
Accidents are scary.

910
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:22,130
Kousuke? Where are you? Kousuke?

911
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:29,270
Chiaki.

912
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,320
Kousuke went home.

913
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,870
Man, neither of you came to the field.

914
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:37,560
Sorry.

915
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,570
I'm waiting!

916
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:39,380
Say...

917
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:44,530
I've wanted to ask you something for a long time.

918
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,330
Is playing baseball with me fun?

919
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:49,500
What's that?

920
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:52,430
I like playing baseball with you.

921
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:54,970
You sure suck for someone who likes playing.

922
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:57,370
All you're good at is brute force.

923
01:01:57,370 --> 01:01:58,510
Better than being good at nothing at all.

924
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,820
What are you laughing about?!

925
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:07,550
It just feels like we haven't really talked in a while.

926
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:09,960
What are you talking about? We've been talking since morning.

927
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,000
Oh, right.

928
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:12,580
You're right.

929
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:14,000
Do you miss me that much?

930
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,580
W-What? Stupid!

931
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:17,880
It's a joke! Man...

932
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,380
Look...

933
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:24,400
I also want to ask you something.

934
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,360
What?

935
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,380
It's a really stupid question though.

936
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:28,570
What is it?

937
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:31,350
Well...

938
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:33,320
Just say it, come on.

939
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:36,610
Are you time leaping?

940
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:45,050
You are, aren't you?

941
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,000
Hey, Makoto!

942
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,740
Makoto!

943
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:56,850
Look...

944
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:59,780
I also want to ask you something.

945
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:03,160
It's a really stupid question though.

946
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:05,130
Well...

947
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:06,560
W-W-Wait a minute.

948
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:08,410
Let's talk about my sister.

949
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:09,510
Why?

950
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:11,760
You know, she's so stupid...

951
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,260
Hey there! I'm trying to...

952
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:17,460
Never mind.

953
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,140
I'll be waiting.

954
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,360
How did he...?

955
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:32,260
Zero? So it really was the number of times I could time leap...

956
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:35,590
I wasted the last one on something stupid...

957
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:39,630
Oh, well. I know that Kousuke is fine now.

958
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:41,210
Yo, Makoto!

959
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,510
Let me borrow your bike a little longer.

960
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:57,120
Wait, Kousuke!

961
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:57,430
Ko-

962
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,680
Hey! Are you blind or something?!

963
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,760
Apologize! Hey!

964
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:11,240
Stop, Kousuke!

965
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:13,740
Kousuke!

966
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,330
Kousuke!

967
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,830
Stop!

968
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,920
Kousuke, Kousuke!

969
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:31,510
Kousuke, Kousuke!

970
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,300
Is she all right?

971
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,920
Hey, she's seriously hurt!

972
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,200
Call an ambulance!

973
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,540
How did she...

974
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:17,540
Stop, stop, stop!

975
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:20,270
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

976
01:05:20,270 --> 01:05:23,230
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

977
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:25,790
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

978
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:26,810
Stop...

979
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:30,820
Stop!

980
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,720
D-Did it stop?

981
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:00,490
So it really was you.

982
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:03,890
Chiaki?

983
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:06,620
What are you doing here?

984
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:08,770
Where's Kousuke?

985
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:10,650
Still home, I guess.

986
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:13,170
But he just...

987
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:24,060
Did... you do this?

988
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,730
You can leap?

989
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:27,130
You too?

990
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:31,010
If I told you that I came from the future...

991
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:33,090
...would you laugh?

992
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:35,250
In my era...

993
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:39,610
...they've developed a device which lets you go freely back and forth in time.

994
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:43,270
This thing here.

995
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:45,220
You use it to charge your body.

996
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:49,530
I used this thing to travel to this time.

997
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:54,960
But then, I managed to lose it somewhere.

998
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:57,720
I was frantic.

999
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:00,300
I looked all around and finally found it.

1000
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,420
In the science room.

1001
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,070
But it was all used up.

1002
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:11,780
But I'm glad.

1003
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:13,900
That an idiot got its charge.

1004
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:18,980
I was up every night worrying about someone using it for bad things.

1005
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:23,240
W-Why?

1006
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:25,910
Because.

1007
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:28,880
Because?

1008
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:35,070
Because there was a painting I had to see.

1009
01:08:36,690 --> 01:08:40,710
No matter how far away it was... No matter where it was...

1010
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:44,260
No matter how dangerous it would be...

1011
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:45,720
[ A Picture of White Plum, Two Camellia and Chrysanthemum.
Currently in restoration. ]

1012
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,370
I wanted to see it.

1013
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:57,340
In my era, it was already destroyed in a fire.

1014
01:08:57,750 --> 01:09:00,760
Its whereabouts before this era are unknown.

1015
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:04,140
The only confirmed record of its existence...

1016
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:08,360
...was in this time, this place and this season.

1017
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:12,490
You just want... to see it?

1018
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:15,020
That's all I wanted.

1019
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,750
I wanted to remember it for all my life.

1020
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:28,790
But...

1021
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:31,250
There's no point anymore.

1022
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,100
None at all.

1023
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:40,310
You can't go back anymore? Hey, what do you mean?

1024
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:44,170
Like I said, I can't go back to my era.

1025
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:45,530
But why?

1026
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:50,610
To go back and snatch your bike that Kousuke was going to ride...

1027
01:09:50,610 --> 01:09:53,520
I used up my remaining charge.

1028
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:55,660
W-What will you do?

1029
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:57,290
There's nothing I can do.

1030
01:09:57,650 --> 01:09:59,750
Why did you use it?!

1031
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:01,800
Shouldn't it have been saved for the right time?!

1032
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:03,870
It was the right time.

1033
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:11,310
You don't remember, but Kousuke and that girl died once at that crossing.

1034
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:17,260
A certain someone was crying with guilt, so I had no choice.

1035
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,540
I had to go back, but before I noticed, it was summer.

1036
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:29,320
Being with you two...

1037
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:32,320
...was too much fun.

1038
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:56,300
It was the first time I ever saw a running river on the surface.

1039
01:10:58,330 --> 01:11:00,060
It was the first time I ever rode a bike.

1040
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:04,830
It was the first time I ever knew how vast the sky was.

1041
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:07,490
And above all...

1042
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:11,130
...it was the first time I'd ever seen so many people in one place.

1043
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:16,500
Say... Chiaki.

1044
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:18,500
Could it be that...

1045
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:22,770
...there was a connection between the painting...

1046
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:25,570
...and the future you lived in?

1047
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:32,230
Hey, tell me.

1048
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:39,180
I like this era.

1049
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,060
You have baseball.

1050
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,440
There's no more baseball?!

1051
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:47,010
Where are you looking, stupid?

1052
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:49,570
Stop goofing around.

1053
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:52,600
About that painting...

1054
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:54,670
About that painting!

1055
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,790
If you wait a bit longer, you can see it.

1056
01:11:58,220 --> 01:12:00,500
It's being restored right now...

1057
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:03,550
Let's go together! The three of us including Kousuke.

1058
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,930
I mean, summer break is about to start!

1059
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:08,470
Hey, Chiaki. Chiaki!

1060
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,750
Sorry, I can't.

1061
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:15,990
I'm going to disappear tomorrow.

1062
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:18,150
W-Why?

1063
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:22,370
People in the past must not learn about time leaping.

1064
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:25,670
I've violated that rule.

1065
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:27,880
So...

1066
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:30,600
I won't be seeing you again.

1067
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:33,780
I'll keep quiet! I couldn't ever tell anyone.

1068
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:37,790
Chiaki? Where are you?

1069
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:40,480
Hey, Chiaki...

1070
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,680
Chiaki...

1071
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:45,290
Chiaki...

1072
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:48,160
You said that we'd go to a nighter together!

1073
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:49,090
Sorry.

1074
01:12:49,090 --> 01:12:51,510
And you said that we'd go to a fireworks display!

1075
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,180
Really sorry.

1076
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:56,310
Don't you want to see me in a yukata?

1077
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:59,930
Sorry, I kinda wanna see that.

1078
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:02,980
Idiot!

1079
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:09,650
Chiaki!

1080
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,900
Chiaki!

1081
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:22,680
Chiaki, wait up! Chiaki!

1082
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:52,060
Why did Chiaki-kun leave school?

1083
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:54,790
I heard he got into debt, and the yakuza are after him!

1084
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:57,160
Really? Wasn't it because his parents got divorced?

1085
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,470
They say he's marrying an older girl.

1086
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,520
I heard she got pregnant.

1087
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,990
What, for real?!

1088
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:05,670
Hey, what happened, Makoto?

1089
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:10,490
He's not like that!

1090
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:12,670
Sounds like he stabbed the guy with a box cutter.

1091
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:15,020
I heard he beat him up with a bat.

1092
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:17,580
Or slashed him up with a knife.

1093
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,060
I said he's not like that!

1094
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:21,080
Hey, Kousuke!

1095
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,240
Hey! Kousuke!

1096
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:31,810
What's going on...

1097
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:38,820
Forget me... He didn't at least let you know?

1098
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,260
Even though he liked you...

1099
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:49,930
Did he say that?

1100
01:14:50,210 --> 01:14:51,590
It was plain to see.

1101
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:53,750
You didn't notice?

1102
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,750
Well, you've never been good with that stuff.

1103
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:02,940
Maybe that's why he didn't tell you.

1104
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:06,570
Kousuke.

1105
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:10,420
I'm an awful person.

1106
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:14,310
Someone told something important...

1107
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:16,650
...but I undid it.

1108
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:19,440
Why didn't I listen properly?

1109
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:22,990
Makoto?

1110
01:15:24,030 --> 01:15:25,110
What are you talking about?

1111
01:15:26,450 --> 01:15:27,340
H-Hey!

1112
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:10,220
Calmed down?

1113
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:13,710
Actually...

1114
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:20,810
I thought that you would stay friends with both Kousuke-kun and Chiaki-kun.

1115
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,800
Graduate without dating either of them...

1116
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:31,610
...and then end up dating someone totally different.

1117
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:35,010
That's what I thought until yesterday.

1118
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:38,470
But it's not like that, is it?

1119
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:47,750
I first fell in love in high school.

1120
01:16:49,330 --> 01:16:51,070
We became really close as soon as we met.

1121
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:54,670
It was like we'd known each other since childhood.

1122
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,890
But it was over before we became adults.

1123
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:02,230
Why?

1124
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:06,270
The timing was probably bad.

1125
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:10,310
What is he doing now?

1126
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:13,140
I wonder.

1127
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:16,760
He said he would definitely return one day.

1128
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,310
Though I didn't plan on waiting for him.

1129
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:21,370
And so much time has passed.

1130
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,100
It didn't last long.

1131
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:27,870
A blink of an eye.

1132
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:32,890
But, Makoto...

1133
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:37,730
...you're not like me, right?

1134
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:45,050
If someone were late for an appointment...

1135
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:47,790
...wouldn't you run out to meet him?

1136
01:17:57,290 --> 01:17:59,300
Makoto, watermelon!

1137
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,200
Father!

1138
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:03,900
What's with her? No food... Not even watermelon?

1139
01:18:04,190 --> 01:18:05,370
It's a broken heart.

1140
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:06,080
No way!

1141
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,160
Miyuki, that was uncalled for.

1142
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:21,320
If someone were late for an appointment...

1143
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:24,050
...wouldn't you run out to meet him?

1144
01:18:42,790 --> 01:18:43,780
Why?!

1145
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:46,540
It should have been zero...

1146
01:18:51,570 --> 01:18:52,390
Could it be...

1147
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,370
Makoto!

1148
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:57,180
Big sis!

1149
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:58,260
Don't do anything foolish, Makoto!

1150
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:02,510
Makoto!

1151
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:08,680
It's because Chiaki went back in time!

1152
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:12,310
Then it should also apply to him!

1153
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:13,350
Oh, Mako-chan.

1154
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:15,490
Chiaki can also...!

1155
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:23,000
Here I...

1156
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:27,150
...go!

1157
01:19:55,790 --> 01:19:57,360
All right, no talking.

1158
01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:58,900
Who're you?

1159
01:19:58,020 --> 01:19:59,230
No talking!

1160
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:03,020
I'm Tsuda, this is Konno.

1161
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:03,020
This is a transfer student, Mamiya Chiaki-kun.

1162
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:04,060
A girl?

1163
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:06,530
Not a product of well-breeding, but let's get along.

1164
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:07,660
Makoto, come here!

1165
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:10,130
See ya, Makoto.

1166
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:14,710
Did you hear that? He used your first name.

1167
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,830
Makoto.

1168
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:28,920
Let's go out.

1169
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:32,420
From the "what if Kousuke got a girlfriend".

1170
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:37,500
I'm... not that ugly, right?

1171
01:21:19,710 --> 01:21:20,510
Makoto?

1172
01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:24,440
Are you okay?

1173
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:32,590
I wonder what Chiaki-kun does on his days off.

1174
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,980
He can't play baseball all day long.

1175
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:41,030
Yuri.

1176
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:43,800
You know, I...

1177
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:46,170
...have something I couldn't tell you.

1178
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:47,420
What is it?

1179
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:50,230
I...

1180
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:53,000
...like Chiaki.

1181
01:21:56,050 --> 01:21:56,960
Sorry.

1182
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:02,760
I see.

1183
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:04,530
That's what I thought.

1184
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:08,580
I passed him on my way here.

1185
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,020
Go.

1186
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:18,110
Makoto.

1187
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:21,310
Time waits for no one.

1188
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:23,930
Makoto!

1189
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:26,930
Kousuke?

1190
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:28,560
Where's Chiaki?

1191
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:31,200
Got tired of waiting and went to the field.

1192
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:33,820
He's quite annoyed. We better go quick.

1193
01:22:34,670 --> 01:22:37,770
You're leaving your girlfriend alone? After all my effort...

1194
01:22:37,770 --> 01:22:39,230
Girlfriend? Whose?

1195
01:22:39,230 --> 01:22:42,340
Oh, right! I went all the way back...

1196
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:44,030
What are you talking about?

1197
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:45,800
Um, that's...

1198
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:55,960
Say, why don't you invite those girls to play with us?

1199
01:22:56,780 --> 01:22:58,360
Go and invite them!

1200
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:59,340
What for?

1201
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:01,620
Because it's more fun with more people.

1202
01:23:02,350 --> 01:23:05,520
Do you know them?

1203
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,450
Sort of.

1204
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:07,860
Also...

1205
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,610
If you want to use my bike, it'll be 5000 yen.

1206
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:14,570
Got it? Five thousand!

1207
01:23:14,570 --> 01:23:16,750
Hey, what do you mean?!

1208
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:20,490
Say "Let's play baseball together", you hear me?

1209
01:23:22,050 --> 01:23:23,090
And also...

1210
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:25,210
Thanks for waiting for me!

1211
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:29,220
Makoto!

1212
01:23:30,230 --> 01:23:31,580
Look in front of you when you're running!

1213
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:34,060
Sure!

1214
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:57,060
You're late. Where's Kousuke?

1215
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:58,500
He's not coming.

1216
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,890
What's with him?

1217
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,180
Where did you find it?

1218
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:15,180
No... Do you know what is it?

1219
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:16,860
I do.

1220
01:25:17,810 --> 01:25:18,830
Who told you?

1221
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:20,260
You did.

1222
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:21,680
I didn't!

1223
01:25:22,430 --> 01:25:24,000
I couldn't have!

1224
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,040
You told me everything.

1225
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:28,500
About the era you live in.

1226
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:30,660
About this device.

1227
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:31,980
Everything.

1228
01:25:32,430 --> 01:25:33,900
H-Hey.

1229
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,100
Like I thought.

1230
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:38,010
I'm glad.

1231
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:40,220
Where are you from?

1232
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:42,240
From the future.

1233
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:43,540
You can leap?

1234
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:44,680
Not anymore.

1235
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:46,870
So I told you that?

1236
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:49,320
And you believed me?

1237
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:51,540
What a fool.

1238
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:52,490
Maybe so.

1239
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:54,580
Did you come just to say that?

1240
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:04,950
Why did I talk... idiot.

1241
01:26:54,670 --> 01:26:57,520
The painting... you can see it back in the future.

1242
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:01,960
It won't disappear or burn up.

1243
01:27:04,650 --> 01:27:07,040
It will still be there in your era.

1244
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:09,470
I'll make sure of it.

1245
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:13,650
I'm counting on you.

1246
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:21,140
I had to go back, but before I noticed, it was summer.

1247
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:26,820
Being with you two was too much fun.

1248
01:27:29,710 --> 01:27:31,340
That's not how you said it before.

1249
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:33,740
Then what'd I say?

1250
01:27:43,770 --> 01:27:44,710
I'm not telling.

1251
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:47,060
Why?

1252
01:27:48,410 --> 01:27:50,840
Come on, what did I say?

1253
01:27:51,670 --> 01:27:52,590
Not telling.

1254
01:27:53,050 --> 01:27:56,230
Tell me! I wanna know, yeah? Hey!

1255
01:27:58,210 --> 01:27:59,040
It's a couple!

1256
01:27:59,790 --> 01:28:00,730
A couple!

1257
01:28:00,730 --> 01:28:01,580
A couple!

1258
01:28:02,590 --> 01:28:03,740
Getting it on!

1259
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:04,860
Couple, couple!

1260
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:05,830
Shut up, idiots!

1261
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:07,840
Run away quick!

1262
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:23,290
Give my regards to Kousuke.

1263
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,180
And say I'm sorry I didn't do it myself.

1264
01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:30,230
And also...

1265
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:33,150
Makoto.

1266
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:38,860
What is it?

1267
01:28:40,410 --> 01:28:43,690
There's something I've wanted to say for a long time.

1268
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:48,780
You...

1269
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:54,440
Make sure you don't get hurt when you're racing around.

1270
01:28:59,590 --> 01:29:02,740
You know, you've got a short attention span.

1271
01:29:03,230 --> 01:29:05,300
Think some more before acting, okay?

1272
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,010
What the heck.

1273
01:29:08,630 --> 01:29:10,600
That's all you have to say in the end?!

1274
01:29:11,110 --> 01:29:13,340
Idiot, I'm worried, you know.

1275
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:21,040
Fine! Thank you so much for worrying about me!

1276
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:23,090
So hurry up and go!

1277
01:29:23,090 --> 01:29:24,710
What are you mad about?

1278
01:29:24,710 --> 01:29:26,120
Go, I said!

1279
01:29:27,890 --> 01:29:28,780
See ya.

1280
01:29:29,590 --> 01:29:30,620
See ya!

1281
01:30:06,570 --> 01:30:07,740
Why is that?

1282
01:30:43,740 --> 01:30:44,960
I'll be waiting in the future.

1283
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:55,140
I'll be right there. I'll run there.

1284
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:28,560
Makoto.

1285
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:32,270
Makoto!

1286
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:36,320
Hey, Makoto!

1287
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:49,940
Really, what's going on?

1288
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:52,860
Forget me... He didn't at least let you know?

1289
01:31:53,610 --> 01:31:56,790
And he's leaving school to study abroad all of a sudden?

1290
01:31:58,150 --> 01:31:59,480
Don't make me laugh!

1291
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,460
I'm sorry!

1292
01:32:05,830 --> 01:32:07,490
Kaho, it's okay.

1293
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:10,420
He probably decided on what he wanted to do.

1294
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,420
Did you hear something?

1295
01:32:14,030 --> 01:32:14,820
Not really.

1296
01:32:15,260 --> 01:32:16,060
Nothing.

1297
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:18,340
There!

1298
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:21,370
Sorry!

1299
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:23,630
Kaho, you have no strength at all.

1300
01:32:23,630 --> 01:32:24,490
Good grief.

1301
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:28,410
I also decided on what I'm going to do from now.

1302
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:30,160
What?

1303
01:32:30,490 --> 01:32:32,090
Secret.

1304
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:34,850
What's that?

1305
01:32:36,230 --> 01:32:37,350
Maybe later.

1306
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:15,880
Konno-senpai!

1307
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:17,000
Yeah!

1308
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:19,220
There!

1309
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:24,290
Nice throw!

1310
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:26,970
Here I go!

1311
01:33:28,850 --> 01:33:29,770
There!
