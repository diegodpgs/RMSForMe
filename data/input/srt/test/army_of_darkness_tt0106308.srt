1
00:00:34,414 --> 00:00:37,713
<i>My name is Ash. And I am a slave.</i>

2
00:00:41,188 --> 00:00:44,157
<i>Close as I can figure it,
the year is 1300 AD...</i>

3
00:00:44,224 --> 00:00:46,749
<i>...and I am being dragged to my death.</i>

4
00:00:46,893 --> 00:00:48,724
<i>It wasn't always like this.</i>

5
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,764
<i>I had a real life once.</i>

6
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,860
<i>A job.</i>

7
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:05,172
Hardware. Aisle 12.
Shop smart, shop S-Mart.

8
00:01:05,746 --> 00:01:08,738
<i>I had a wonderful girlfriend, Linda.</i>

9
00:01:11,918 --> 00:01:15,217
<i>Together we drove to a small cabin
in the mountains.</i>

10
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,228
<i>It seems an archeologist
had come to this remote place...</i>

11
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:24,889
<i>...to translate and study his latest find.</i>

12
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:30,426
<i>Necronomicon ex Mortis.
The Book of the Dead.</i>

13
00:01:32,806 --> 00:01:36,071
<i>Bound in human flesh and inked in blood...</i>

14
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:40,541
<i>...this ancient Sumerian text contained
bizarre burial rites...</i>

15
00:01:40,914 --> 00:01:45,408
<i>...funerary incantations
and demon resurrection passages.</i>

16
00:01:46,753 --> 00:01:49,483
<i>It was never meant
for the world of the living.</i>

17
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:52,756
<i>The book awoke something
dark in the woods.</i>

18
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,156
<i>It took Linda.</i>

19
00:02:02,335 --> 00:02:04,303
<i>And then it came for me.</i>

20
00:02:05,772 --> 00:02:10,732
<i>It got into my hand and it went bad.
So I lopped it off at the wrist.</i>

21
00:02:16,983 --> 00:02:19,611
<i>But that didn't stop it. It came back.</i>

22
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:23,584
<i>Big time.</i>

23
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:44,274
<i>For God's sake! How do you stop it?</i>

24
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:42,866
Surround the stranger!

25
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:58,613
<i>Where the hell....</i>

26
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:13,725
<i>Easy now, chief.
I don't know how I got here.</i>

27
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:18,167
<i>And I'm not looking for any trouble.</i>

28
00:04:21,274 --> 00:04:23,003
What a piece of armor this is!

29
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:25,770
Wiseman!

30
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:35,182
My lord, I believe he is the one
written of in the Necronomicon.

31
00:04:35,622 --> 00:04:38,022
He who is prophesied to fall
from the heavens...

32
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:40,582
...and deliver us from
the terrors of the Deadites.

33
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:42,556
What? That buffoon?

34
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:44,158
Likely...

35
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:46,964
<i>...he's one of Henry's men!</i>

36
00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:50,659
Kneel, rapscallion!

37
00:04:51,972 --> 00:04:54,133
I say, to the pit with him!

38
00:04:58,511 --> 00:05:01,776
-To the pit!
-You miserable bastard!

39
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:05,173
Get off of me!

40
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:08,885
Let me go!

41
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,920
To the castle!

42
00:05:22,502 --> 00:05:25,960
Pick up your feet!
Stop dragging your feet! Come on!

43
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:30,906
Move along. Come on, now.
Come on, pick it up.

44
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:33,836
Have a taste of this!

45
00:05:40,654 --> 00:05:41,848
All right, you men!

46
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:46,153
<i>You've got something to look forward to
when you get back to the castle!</i>

47
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:50,522
Lord Arthur approaches!
Raise the portcullis!

48
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:56,467
Lord Arthur! Lord Arthur approaches!

49
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:50,651
Lord Arthur, where is my brother?
Did he not ride with you?

50
00:06:50,857 --> 00:06:52,882
Aye, and fought valiantly.

51
00:06:53,526 --> 00:06:56,552
<i>But last night he fell in battle
to Duke Henry's men.</i>

52
00:06:57,363 --> 00:06:58,796
<i>I'm sorry, Sheila.</i>

53
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,091
-Come on.
-You cretin!

54
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:04,660
Stop it, you bastards!

55
00:07:06,206 --> 00:07:07,639
Barbarians!

56
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:12,668
Stop it! Stop it, you little bastards!

57
00:07:12,746 --> 00:07:13,735
Beat it!

58
00:07:17,684 --> 00:07:19,117
Foul thing!

59
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:22,719
A pox on your throat!
Thou art a murderer!

60
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:24,555
A bloody murderer!

61
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:32,162
<i>My brother's death shall be avenged!</i>

62
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,606
Company, halt!

63
00:07:52,685 --> 00:07:54,277
Get that yoke off him!

64
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:11,035
You, sir, are not one of my vassals.

65
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,238
Who are you?

66
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:16,836
Who wants to know?

67
00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:21,208
I am Henry the Red. Duke of Shale.

68
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:24,482
Lord of the Northlands
and leader of its peoples.

69
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:29,788
Well, hello, Mister Fancy Pants.
I got news for you, pal.

70
00:08:29,989 --> 00:08:33,083
<i>You ain't leading but two things right now,
jack and shit.</i>

71
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:36,088
<i>-And Jack left town.
-Shut your bleedin' hole!</i>

72
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:39,227
Gentlemen, Lord Arthur!

73
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:50,436
There is an evil awakened in this land.

74
00:08:51,444 --> 00:08:55,141
And while my people fight
for their very souls against it...

75
00:08:55,348 --> 00:08:58,078
...you, Henry the Red, wage war on us.

76
00:08:58,351 --> 00:08:59,818
Charlatan!

77
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:05,191
It was you who first turned
your swords on us.

78
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:08,250
And this evil has befouled
my people as well!

79
00:09:08,328 --> 00:09:11,456
Your people are no better
than the foul corruption...

80
00:09:11,531 --> 00:09:13,726
...that lies in the bowels of that pit!

81
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,765
<i>Right! You're no better!</i>

82
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:18,460
May God have mercy upon your souls.

83
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:36,718
<i>In God's name!
What hell-spawned thing lurks there?</i>

84
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:45,823
Into the pit
with those bloodthirsty sons of whores.

85
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,491
Move!

86
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:49,156
No!

87
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:22,861
God! Heavenly God!

88
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:28,363
<i>He's escaping!</i>

89
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:31,266
Hold him!

90
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:08,036
<i>They don't look so clever now, do they?</i>

91
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:09,775
<i>He's frightened!</i>

92
00:11:12,752 --> 00:11:16,119
Whoa, whoa! Wait a minute.

93
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:19,684
Hold it. Wait a minute!

94
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:21,918
You gotta understand, man.

95
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:25,463
I never even saw these assholes before!

96
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,764
He trembles!

97
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:31,398
What are you waiting for?

98
00:11:31,804 --> 00:11:34,170
<i>Henry, you gotta tell them
you don't know me.</i>

99
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:36,774
We never met, tell them!

100
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,879
<i>I do not think he'll listen, lad.</i>

101
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:47,981
<i>Look, I'm telling you.
You've got the wrong guy.</i>

102
00:11:58,431 --> 00:12:01,525
<i>I'm telling you, you got the wrong guy.</i>

103
00:13:17,677 --> 00:13:18,939
<i>Why, you....</i>

104
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:28,813
-Spikes.
-Hey, he said spikes! Give him spikes!

105
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:45,766
Make way! Strange one!

106
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,708
Strange one!

107
00:14:23,943 --> 00:14:26,343
Damn you.

108
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:53,497
You know, your shoelace is untied.

109
00:16:04,477 --> 00:16:05,808
All right.

110
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,104
Who wants some?

111
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:11,709
<i>Who's next?</i>

112
00:16:13,953 --> 00:16:15,420
How about it?

113
00:16:16,022 --> 00:16:20,425
Who wants some?
Who wants to have a little?

114
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:26,186
You.

115
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:31,897
You want some more?

116
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:37,942
You want a little?

117
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:43,241
Do you? You want some more?

118
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:02,859
Now, get on those horses
and get out of here.

119
00:17:06,472 --> 00:17:07,871
Let them go!

120
00:17:31,263 --> 00:17:32,252
Halt!

121
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:35,997
Thank you, generous hosts!

122
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:39,128
Sword boy!

123
00:17:46,979 --> 00:17:50,676
For that arrogance, I shall see you dead.

124
00:17:57,189 --> 00:17:58,417
Sorcery!

125
00:18:01,227 --> 00:18:02,319
Yeah.

126
00:18:03,362 --> 00:18:06,422
All right, you primitive screwheads,
listen up.

127
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:08,832
See this?

128
00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:13,498
This is my boom stick!

129
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,072
<i>It's a 12-gauge, double-barreled Remington.
S-Mart's top of the line.</i>

130
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:22,370
You can find this
in the sporting goods department.

131
00:18:22,948 --> 00:18:26,179
<i>That's right, this sweet baby was made
in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</i>

132
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:28,986
It retails for about $109.95.

133
00:18:29,488 --> 00:18:34,187
<i>It's got a walnut stock,
cobalt-blue steel, and a hair trigger.</i>

134
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,661
<i>That's right. Shop smart. Shop S-Mart.</i>

135
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:41,991
You got that?

136
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:44,765
Now, I swear...

137
00:18:45,704 --> 00:18:48,070
...the next one of you primates...

138
00:18:48,741 --> 00:18:50,902
<i>...even touches me....</i>

139
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:24,900
<i>Now, let's talk about how I get back home.</i>

140
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,441
I prithee to forgive me, my Lord.

141
00:19:58,844 --> 00:20:01,335
<i>I believed thee one of Henry's men.</i>

142
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,740
First you wanna kill me,
now you wanna kiss me.

143
00:20:06,385 --> 00:20:07,477
Blow.

144
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,523
<i>So what's the deal?
Can you send me back or not?</i>

145
00:20:14,593 --> 00:20:19,087
Only the Necronomicon has the power,
an unholy book which we also require.

146
00:20:19,365 --> 00:20:23,233
Within its pages are passages
that can send you back to your time.

147
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:26,097
Only you, the promised one,
can quest for it.

148
00:20:27,373 --> 00:20:30,399
<i>I don't want your book.
I don't want your bullshit!</i>

149
00:20:30,476 --> 00:20:33,843
<i>Just send me back to my own time.
Pronto! Today! Chop....</i>

150
00:20:44,056 --> 00:20:46,923
You shall die!

151
00:20:52,398 --> 00:20:55,629
You shall never take the Necronomicon.

152
00:20:56,335 --> 00:21:00,237
We shall feast upon your souls!

153
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:25,861
<i>It's a trick. Get an ax.</i>

154
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:35,272
Guards! Kill her!

155
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:39,041
Capture the witch! Capture the witch!

156
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:42,872
<i>My eyes! I'm blind! Oh, God, I'm blind!</i>

157
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:45,941
No!

158
00:21:51,423 --> 00:21:52,913
Yo, she-bitch!

159
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,922
<i>Let's go.</i>

160
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,383
If the Necronomicon fell into
the hands of the Deadites...

161
00:22:21,453 --> 00:22:24,047
...all mankind will be consumed
by this evil.

162
00:22:24,123 --> 00:22:26,523
Now will thou quest for the book?

163
00:22:40,372 --> 00:22:41,634
That one.

164
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:10,200
Groovy.

165
00:23:23,682 --> 00:23:26,708
<i>What's the matter, you raised in a barn?
Shut the door.</i>

166
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:30,215
Probably was raised in a barn,
with all the other primitives.

167
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:42,391
The Wisemen say that thou art
the promised one.

168
00:23:46,238 --> 00:23:49,139
<i>'Tis said thou wilt journey for the book
to help us.</i>

169
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:51,904
And that thou wilt lead our people
against the evil.

170
00:23:51,977 --> 00:23:55,242
<i>The only reason I'm going to get the book
is to get home.</i>

171
00:24:01,453 --> 00:24:03,717
I believe thou wilt be leaving
in the morning.

172
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:05,313
<i>Don't touch that, please!</i>

173
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:09,156
<i>Your primitive intellect wouldn't
understand alloys and compositions...</i>

174
00:24:09,228 --> 00:24:12,391
<i>...and things with molecular structures
and the....</i>

175
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:16,933
What are you doing here, anyway?

176
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:22,202
I wanted to say that all of my hopes
and prayers go with thee...

177
00:24:22,508 --> 00:24:24,635
...and I made this for thee.

178
00:24:25,677 --> 00:24:28,168
Good. I could use a horse blanket.

179
00:24:50,502 --> 00:24:52,402
Give me some sugar, baby.

180
00:25:57,769 --> 00:25:59,259
Come on, boys!

181
00:26:20,692 --> 00:26:22,091
Steady, now.

182
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:32,236
-What? What is it?
-This path will lead you to an unholy place.

183
00:26:32,771 --> 00:26:36,400
A cemetery.
There the Necronomicon awaits.

184
00:26:40,212 --> 00:26:43,773
When thou retrievest the book from
its cradle, you must recite the words:

185
00:26:44,016 --> 00:26:46,712
<i>"Klaatu, barada, nikto. "</i>

186
00:26:47,352 --> 00:26:51,686
-Klaatu, barada, nikto. Okay.
-Well, repeat them.

187
00:26:53,091 --> 00:26:56,288
-Klaatu, barada, nikto.
-Again!

188
00:26:56,361 --> 00:26:59,694
I got it! I got it!
I know your damn words, all right?

189
00:27:00,365 --> 00:27:02,492
Now, you get this straight,
the both of you!

190
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:05,161
If I get that book, you send me back.

191
00:27:05,737 --> 00:27:07,864
<i>After that, I'm history.</i>

192
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,262
What is it, boy?

193
00:28:37,095 --> 00:28:38,722
Come on!

194
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:28,423
Ramming speed!

195
00:32:36,768 --> 00:32:38,531
Ready. Aim. Fire!

196
00:32:54,286 --> 00:32:55,685
Shake a leg!

197
00:33:01,926 --> 00:33:03,689
<i>You lousy little....</i>

198
00:33:12,237 --> 00:33:15,638
<i>Yeah! I'm gonna hunt down all you....</i>

199
00:33:32,657 --> 00:33:34,955
You little bastards! All right!

200
00:33:35,226 --> 00:33:39,219
<i>I'll crush each and every one of you.
I'll crush you to pieces, I'm telling you!</i>

201
00:33:39,297 --> 00:33:42,562
<i>I'll squash you so hard,
you'll have to look up to see....</i>

202
00:33:42,634 --> 00:33:44,101
Hey, dumb ass!

203
00:33:48,139 --> 00:33:49,470
<i>Surf's up!</i>

204
00:34:00,618 --> 00:34:02,176
All together now!

205
00:34:19,904 --> 00:34:20,996
Shit!

206
00:34:32,016 --> 00:34:34,348
Quietly. Gently.

207
00:34:41,893 --> 00:34:43,622
Easy, big fella. Easy.

208
00:34:57,776 --> 00:35:01,007
<i>"London Bridge is falling down</i>

209
00:35:01,146 --> 00:35:05,981
<i>"Falling down, falling down"</i>

210
00:35:07,919 --> 00:35:09,853
<i>"My fair lady"</i>

211
00:35:21,566 --> 00:35:23,193
Is he up? Is he?

212
00:35:31,743 --> 00:35:34,371
What a horrible nightmare.

213
00:35:36,047 --> 00:35:37,480
Wait a minute.

214
00:35:37,682 --> 00:35:39,650
Oh, God!

215
00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:42,317
<i>I can't move!</i>

216
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:56,498
Open wide!

217
00:35:57,702 --> 00:35:58,964
<i>Let's go!</i>

218
00:36:00,572 --> 00:36:03,564
Geronimo!

219
00:36:09,614 --> 00:36:10,876
<i>Let's go!</i>

220
00:36:34,005 --> 00:36:38,374
Okay, little fella.
How about some hot chocolate?

221
00:36:48,987 --> 00:36:53,185
<i>How'd you like the taste of that?
How'd you like the taste....</i>

222
00:37:11,042 --> 00:37:13,636
<i>Dear God! It's growing bigger!</i>

223
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:37,758
-Hey!
-Hey!

224
00:37:37,835 --> 00:37:40,201
<i>-What's the big idea...
-What's the big idea...</i>

225
00:37:40,271 --> 00:37:41,795
-Why, you...
-Why, you...

226
00:37:46,477 --> 00:37:48,274
<i>I'm blind. I'm blind.</i>

227
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,758
Where are you taking me?

228
00:38:01,092 --> 00:38:04,823
<i>"Oh, Susanna, don't you cry for me</i>

229
00:38:04,896 --> 00:38:09,196
<i>"'Cause I come from Alabama
with a banjo on my knee"</i>

230
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,347
What are you?

231
00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:26,380
Are you me?

232
00:38:26,551 --> 00:38:28,644
<i>"What are you? Are you me?"</i>

233
00:38:30,622 --> 00:38:33,216
-You sound like a jerk!
-Why are you doing this?

234
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:36,488
<i>You want to know?
Because the answer's easy.</i>

235
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:40,656
<i>I'm bad Ash. And you're good Ash.</i>

236
00:38:40,898 --> 00:38:44,390
<i>You're goody little two-shoes.
You're goody little two-shoes.</i>

237
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:15,592
<i>I ain't that good.</i>

238
00:40:29,273 --> 00:40:31,241
<i>Now you see what's what.</i>

239
00:40:32,777 --> 00:40:35,610
<i>A man's body is his own personal property.</i>

240
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:40,278
<i>Don't let anybody try
and take that away from him.</i>

241
00:40:41,953 --> 00:40:45,787
<i>That'll teach you. Yeah. That'll teach you.</i>

242
00:40:48,326 --> 00:40:50,988
You shall never retrieve the Necronomicon.

243
00:40:51,129 --> 00:40:54,121
<i>You'll die in the graveyard
before you get it.</i>

244
00:40:54,699 --> 00:40:57,896
<i>Hey, what's that you got on your face?</i>

245
00:41:00,905 --> 00:41:03,897
<i>-See how that works?
-I'll come back for you.</i>

246
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,527
Come on, boy!

247
00:41:39,443 --> 00:41:40,603
Come on!

248
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:00,050
Three books?

249
00:43:04,662 --> 00:43:06,755
Wait a minute. Hold it.

250
00:43:07,198 --> 00:43:10,531
Nobody said anything about three books.

251
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:13,132
That stinking Wiseman!

252
00:43:13,304 --> 00:43:16,034
He was so busy filling me
with his secret words...

253
00:43:16,107 --> 00:43:20,373
...and his phrases, and his bullshit,
that he never said anything about this.

254
00:43:22,113 --> 00:43:27,016
Like what am I supposed to do?
Take one book, or all books, or what?

255
00:44:32,717 --> 00:44:34,082
Wrong book.

256
00:45:27,438 --> 00:45:28,962
Get outta here!

257
00:45:39,183 --> 00:45:41,208
<i>I'll get back to you.</i>

258
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,282
Well...

259
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:48,183
...it seems fairly obvious.

260
00:45:52,696 --> 00:45:55,688
Wait a minute. The words. Right.

261
00:45:56,767 --> 00:45:58,632
Say the words.

262
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,501
Klaatu...

263
00:46:04,275 --> 00:46:05,674
<i>...barada....</i>

264
00:46:14,051 --> 00:46:15,109
Necktie.

265
00:46:15,653 --> 00:46:16,779
Nectar.

266
00:46:17,221 --> 00:46:18,415
Nickel.

267
00:46:19,223 --> 00:46:23,455
<i>Noodle. It's an "N" word.
It's definitely an "N" word.</i>

268
00:46:27,064 --> 00:46:28,929
<i>Definitely an "N" word!</i>

269
00:46:40,678 --> 00:46:43,442
<i>Klaatu, barada....</i>

270
00:46:59,497 --> 00:47:00,862
Okay, then.

271
00:47:02,032 --> 00:47:03,363
<i>That's it.</i>

272
00:47:13,911 --> 00:47:16,539
Hey! Wait a minute.

273
00:47:17,081 --> 00:47:20,847
<i>Everything's cool. I said the word. I did!</i>

274
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,644
No! Wait!

275
00:47:30,227 --> 00:47:31,251
No!

276
00:47:39,303 --> 00:47:42,500
You, people, seek cover! To the parapet!

277
00:47:43,707 --> 00:47:45,436
Seek your children.

278
00:47:47,344 --> 00:47:49,005
Steady the horses!

279
00:47:49,613 --> 00:47:52,207
<i>Something's wrong. Something's amiss.</i>

280
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:27,107
<i>Where'd you go?</i>

281
00:49:02,953 --> 00:49:06,252
<i>I'll crush you!
I'll mash your faces, you bony creatures!</i>

282
00:49:15,566 --> 00:49:19,093
Keep your damn, filthy bones
out of my mouth.

283
00:49:36,687 --> 00:49:37,915
Come on!

284
00:49:43,661 --> 00:49:48,598
<i>I'm through being their garbage boy.
I did my part. Now I want back.</i>

285
00:49:48,866 --> 00:49:50,493
Like in the deal.

286
00:50:04,882 --> 00:50:06,679
I...

287
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:08,545
...live...

288
00:50:10,087 --> 00:50:12,487
...again!

289
00:50:22,132 --> 00:50:26,068
<i>There! The promised one!
The promised one's returned!</i>

290
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:28,631
Raise the portcullis!

291
00:50:41,385 --> 00:50:45,947
<i>Truly, he is the promised one!
He's brought the Necronomicon.</i>

292
00:50:46,023 --> 00:50:47,957
<i>-Hi.
-He's got the book!</i>

293
00:50:48,025 --> 00:50:49,424
Yeah, great.

294
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,387
Get the fuck out of my face.

295
00:50:58,535 --> 00:51:02,403
The Necronomicon, quickly.
Did you bring the Necronomicon?

296
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,068
<i>-Yeah, it's just that...
-Just what?</i>

297
00:51:07,511 --> 00:51:09,877
Nothing. Here.

298
00:51:16,487 --> 00:51:19,047
Now send me back. Like in the deal.

299
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:24,052
When you removed the Necronomicon
from the cradle, did you speak the words?

300
00:51:24,395 --> 00:51:27,455
-Yeah, basically.
-Did you speak the exact words?

301
00:51:27,531 --> 00:51:30,500
<i>Look, maybe I didn't say every single,
little tiny syllable...</i>

302
00:51:30,567 --> 00:51:33,365
<i>-... but basically, I said 'em.
-Dung-eating fool!</i>

303
00:51:33,437 --> 00:51:35,371
Thou hast doomed us all.

304
00:51:35,506 --> 00:51:39,067
When thou misspoke the words,
the army of the dead awoke.

305
00:51:39,209 --> 00:51:41,370
Now, whoa, right there, spinach-chin.

306
00:51:41,578 --> 00:51:44,513
You said you could clean this mess up
once you got that book.

307
00:51:44,581 --> 00:51:48,574
<i>That there's a passage in there that could
get rid of this thing and send me back.</i>

308
00:51:48,652 --> 00:51:51,849
<i>It's true, the book still possesses
the power to send you back.</i>

309
00:51:51,922 --> 00:51:56,222
But to us, it is useless! The evil has
a terrible hunger for the Necronomicon.

310
00:51:56,293 --> 00:51:58,693
And it will come here to get it!

311
00:51:59,496 --> 00:52:00,986
We had a deal.

312
00:52:01,632 --> 00:52:04,396
You wanted the damn book,
I got it for you!

313
00:52:04,468 --> 00:52:06,663
I did my part, now you send me back!

314
00:52:06,737 --> 00:52:07,931
Very well.

315
00:52:08,138 --> 00:52:12,302
As we are men of our word,
we shall honor our bargain.

316
00:52:13,477 --> 00:52:16,469
The Wiseman shall return you
to your own time.

317
00:52:17,347 --> 00:52:18,439
Yeah?

318
00:52:19,883 --> 00:52:21,316
I thought he was the one.

319
00:52:21,385 --> 00:52:24,877
Yeah, right, because that was the deal.

320
00:52:25,222 --> 00:52:29,659
<i>So when do you think we can start
with all the thing and the....</i>

321
00:52:29,726 --> 00:52:31,660
<i>He's nothing but a traitor, he is!</i>

322
00:52:32,496 --> 00:52:36,796
When do you think we can start
with all the ceremony and the...

323
00:52:37,601 --> 00:52:40,798
...you know, like, you know, because...

324
00:52:41,371 --> 00:52:44,169
<i>...sooner's always better than later, right?</i>

325
00:52:44,575 --> 00:52:49,808
-Wretched excuse for a man.
-The Wisemen were fools to trust in you.

326
00:52:51,315 --> 00:52:55,149
<i>-I knew he couldn't be trusted.
-I trusted him.</i>

327
00:52:56,587 --> 00:52:59,249
I still believe that thou wilt help us.

328
00:52:59,389 --> 00:53:02,916
<i>Sheila. Don't you get it? It's over.</i>

329
00:53:04,628 --> 00:53:06,721
<i>I didn't have what it took.</i>

330
00:53:08,999 --> 00:53:10,227
So long.

331
00:53:15,606 --> 00:53:17,096
You would leave me?

332
00:53:17,608 --> 00:53:20,338
<i>Cripes, I don't belong here.</i>

333
00:53:21,778 --> 00:53:24,144
<i>I got a chance to go back, and I'm taking it.</i>

334
00:53:24,314 --> 00:53:26,544
<i>But what of the things that we've shared?</i>

335
00:53:26,617 --> 00:53:30,053
What of all the sweet words
that you spoke in private?

336
00:53:32,089 --> 00:53:36,048
<i>Well, that's just what we call pillow talk,
baby. That's all.</i>

337
00:53:36,426 --> 00:53:38,291
It was more than that!

338
00:53:40,163 --> 00:53:42,256
I still have faith in thee.

339
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:46,131
I still believe that thou wilt stay
and save us.

340
00:53:51,842 --> 00:53:52,831
Coward.

341
00:54:16,366 --> 00:54:19,335
-Help me!
-Sheila!

342
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:35,541
<i>Hold your arms! You'll hit the girl.</i>

343
00:54:40,624 --> 00:54:41,886
My sword.

344
00:54:46,964 --> 00:54:48,226
Damn you!

345
00:55:07,017 --> 00:55:08,507
Dig, damn you!

346
00:55:09,786 --> 00:55:11,617
Dig faster!

347
00:55:11,888 --> 00:55:15,619
I shall command every worm-infested
son of a bitch that ever died in battle.

348
00:55:15,692 --> 00:55:17,250
-Thank you, sir.
-You there!

349
00:55:17,327 --> 00:55:18,954
Handsomely, now!

350
00:55:19,062 --> 00:55:21,860
We shall storm their castle
and get my book.

351
00:55:22,265 --> 00:55:24,256
Hoist, you damnable varlets!

352
00:55:29,139 --> 00:55:32,370
Welcome back to the land of the living.

353
00:55:33,076 --> 00:55:35,670
Now pick up a shovel and get digging!

354
00:55:37,848 --> 00:55:39,543
Bring on the wench!

355
00:55:40,117 --> 00:55:41,675
Get down there!

356
00:55:51,495 --> 00:55:53,395
Give me some sugar, baby.

357
00:55:59,569 --> 00:56:03,403
<i>Now ain't you the sweet little thing?</i>

358
00:56:06,743 --> 00:56:09,610
<i>Don't touch me, you foul thing!</i>

359
00:56:22,059 --> 00:56:25,256
<i>Come on. That's it.</i>

360
00:56:39,176 --> 00:56:41,906
We got plans for you, girly-girl! Move!

361
00:56:43,714 --> 00:56:47,150
Bust your bones, you dig up holes, dogs!
Get thee hence!

362
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:58,789
A scout approaches!

363
00:57:06,103 --> 00:57:07,593
Get his horse!

364
00:57:08,538 --> 00:57:09,664
Arise.

365
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:13,540
My Lord, an army of the dead gather
in the wilderness and approach the castle.

366
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:16,044
-How far from here?
-But two days ride.

367
00:57:16,179 --> 00:57:19,910
-These winged ones are only the first.
-Perhaps we should leave soon.

368
00:57:19,983 --> 00:57:22,611
<i>-We'll be safe in the mountains.
-Yes. We must flee!</i>

369
00:57:22,686 --> 00:57:25,746
<i>-It is written. It's been foretold.
-They'll take our souls.</i>

370
00:57:25,822 --> 00:57:27,790
<i>-I'm afraid!
-Every one of our souls!</i>

371
00:57:27,858 --> 00:57:29,519
<i>I don't want to die.</i>

372
00:57:30,494 --> 00:57:34,453
<i>That's it! Go ahead and run!</i>

373
00:57:35,499 --> 00:57:39,162
Run home and cry to mama! Me?

374
00:57:40,637 --> 00:57:42,400
<i>I'm through running!</i>

375
00:57:44,541 --> 00:57:47,066
I say we stay here and fight it out.

376
00:57:47,611 --> 00:57:51,741
Are all men from the future
loudmouth braggarts?

377
00:57:52,149 --> 00:57:55,016
No. Just me, baby.

378
00:57:55,685 --> 00:57:56,674
Just me.

379
00:57:57,788 --> 00:58:01,349
How will we fight an army of the dead
at our castle walls?

380
00:58:01,691 --> 00:58:06,526
How will you fight that? More words?
Most of our people have already fled.

381
00:58:06,763 --> 00:58:08,697
We are but 60 men.

382
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:13,529
<i>Then we'll get Henry the Red
and his men to fight with us.</i>

383
00:58:16,139 --> 00:58:20,166
<i>Now! Who's with me?</i>

384
00:58:34,357 --> 00:58:36,154
<i>I'll stand by you.</i>

385
00:58:38,395 --> 00:58:42,593
<i>-You can count on my steel.
-I'll offer up my courage!</i>

386
00:58:42,933 --> 00:58:46,130
<i>-Me sword's by your side!
-I'm with you!</i>

387
00:58:46,703 --> 00:58:48,728
<i>I'll bend my bow to your will, sir.</i>

388
00:58:53,109 --> 00:58:56,272
Hail! Hail! Hail!

389
00:59:13,705 --> 00:59:17,698
Well, my dear, say hello to the boys.

390
00:59:24,215 --> 00:59:26,706
<i>There's a sight for sore bones.</i>

391
00:59:31,122 --> 00:59:35,821
I may be bad, but I feel good.

392
00:59:37,729 --> 00:59:40,357
-Who rules?
-It is you, my lord.

393
00:59:40,465 --> 00:59:41,955
To the castle!

394
00:59:44,736 --> 00:59:46,567
<i>-But the men are afraid!
-It's too heavy! Now, that's enough.</i>

395
00:59:46,638 --> 00:59:48,799
Quit your bellyaching!

396
00:59:49,874 --> 00:59:54,038
<i>I know you're scared. We're all scared.</i>

397
00:59:55,513 --> 00:59:58,038
<i>But that doesn't mean we're cowards.</i>

398
00:59:58,683 --> 01:00:01,584
We can take these Deadites,
we can take them!

399
01:00:03,254 --> 01:00:04,653
With science.

400
01:00:08,827 --> 01:00:10,692
Hurry up, now!

401
01:00:11,396 --> 01:00:13,830
Come on, fellas! Push! Heave ho!

402
01:01:05,784 --> 01:01:07,149
Tilt. Tilt.

403
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,953
Okay, in, in.

404
01:01:55,734 --> 01:01:59,261
<i>They're coming! The Deadites approach!</i>

405
01:02:04,909 --> 01:02:08,345
<i>Quickly now, you worthless fools!
They'll be on us anon!</i>

406
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:09,970
Come on, guys!

407
01:02:14,219 --> 01:02:18,349
The moment of truth is almost here.
You men better not fail me now.

408
01:02:34,773 --> 01:02:36,968
<i>There's so damned many of them.</i>

409
01:02:50,388 --> 01:02:51,980
I need more men.

410
01:03:34,999 --> 01:03:38,958
Battle stations! Get those rocks up!
On the double!

411
01:03:39,337 --> 01:03:43,433
<i>Ready the catapults!
By God, let's give them what for!</i>

412
01:03:53,084 --> 01:03:54,176
Halt!

413
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:01,580
-Looking glass!
-Aye, sire.

414
01:05:09,394 --> 01:05:11,828
Once I possess the Necronomicon...

415
01:05:13,064 --> 01:05:18,058
...I shall rule, and you shall be my queen.

416
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:35,385
My lord, we are positioned on both fronts.

417
01:05:35,453 --> 01:05:38,820
Fine. Where are they keeping my book?

418
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:42,057
There, my lord.
Beyond the drawbridge in the second wall.

419
01:05:42,126 --> 01:05:44,151
That would be the safest place.

420
01:05:44,228 --> 01:05:48,927
I will not allow anything to keep me
from possessing that Necronomicon.

421
01:05:50,735 --> 01:05:54,967
Now, bring me forth into that castle.

422
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:58,537
-Forward!
-Forward!

423
01:05:58,643 --> 01:06:02,511
Cry havoc, and let loose the dogs of war!

424
01:06:03,114 --> 01:06:06,015
To the castle!

425
01:06:10,088 --> 01:06:11,350
Excellent.

426
01:06:14,392 --> 01:06:16,826
Death to the mortals!

427
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,225
Arrows!

428
01:06:21,799 --> 01:06:22,891
Bows.

429
01:06:23,634 --> 01:06:24,726
Load!

430
01:06:26,504 --> 01:06:27,562
Draw!

431
01:06:38,082 --> 01:06:39,743
Torch boy!

432
01:07:22,026 --> 01:07:23,220
Steady.

433
01:07:30,201 --> 01:07:31,293
Fire!

434
01:07:34,005 --> 01:07:36,701
Advance, you demons! Advance!

435
01:07:57,895 --> 01:08:00,864
Yeah, baby!

436
01:08:08,106 --> 01:08:09,437
All right!

437
01:08:10,608 --> 01:08:13,304
<i>-Retreat!
-Let's get the hell out of here!</i>

438
01:08:23,521 --> 01:08:24,783
Damn him!

439
01:08:25,656 --> 01:08:28,420
The sortie on the second flank will stand.

440
01:08:28,593 --> 01:08:30,117
It must!

441
01:08:31,496 --> 01:08:35,193
<i>Sire, there's a second division
approaching from the south.</i>

442
01:08:35,833 --> 01:08:38,495
Ram the gates!

443
01:08:42,874 --> 01:08:44,205
Catapults!

444
01:08:44,642 --> 01:08:46,769
Catapults! South!

445
01:08:53,651 --> 01:08:57,519
<i>-We'll crush them!
-We'll strike again!</i>

446
01:09:09,967 --> 01:09:11,457
Fire!

447
01:09:19,043 --> 01:09:20,374
What the blazes?

448
01:09:28,452 --> 01:09:30,443
-Watch out!
-Make way!

449
01:09:37,328 --> 01:09:38,693
Seek cover!

450
01:09:48,272 --> 01:09:51,070
You miserable bags of bones!

451
01:09:51,242 --> 01:09:54,837
<i>Pick yourselves up and sally for....</i>

452
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:57,311
<i>Sally for....</i>

453
01:09:58,549 --> 01:10:00,574
Sally forth.

454
01:10:04,322 --> 01:10:06,620
Come on, you miserable wretches!

455
01:10:17,268 --> 01:10:18,360
Forward!

456
01:10:21,105 --> 01:10:23,596
Buttress that door! Now!

457
01:10:40,524 --> 01:10:41,684
Rocks!

458
01:10:42,927 --> 01:10:44,087
Damn you!

459
01:10:47,832 --> 01:10:49,925
<i>That's gotta hurt!</i>

460
01:10:50,334 --> 01:10:51,699
You cretins!

461
01:10:52,036 --> 01:10:53,230
Arrows!

462
01:10:54,438 --> 01:10:55,427
Fire!

463
01:11:00,911 --> 01:11:03,607
<i>We'll ram it down the bastard's throat!</i>

464
01:11:05,016 --> 01:11:06,108
Fire!

465
01:11:11,555 --> 01:11:14,183
South flank, to the western wall! Now!

466
01:11:14,759 --> 01:11:18,388
Where is Henry the Red?
I told you he would not come!

467
01:11:18,462 --> 01:11:23,263
<i>Keep your sardine can on, bucket-head!
I said he'll be here, he'll be here!</i>

468
01:11:23,668 --> 01:11:26,364
I think he will not. But know this.

469
01:11:26,771 --> 01:11:31,606
No matter how this battle fares,
I was wrong to think you a coward.

470
01:11:37,348 --> 01:11:40,146
<i>We've broken through! The castle is ours!</i>

471
01:11:45,122 --> 01:11:47,784
Kill the mortals!

472
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:54,054
All right, men!

473
01:12:24,161 --> 01:12:27,494
<i>They've breached the first wall!
What next?</i>

474
01:12:34,472 --> 01:12:36,906
We are deserted!

475
01:12:37,942 --> 01:12:40,467
Fall back! Man the parapet!

476
01:12:40,845 --> 01:12:42,472
Protect the book!

477
01:12:43,781 --> 01:12:45,373
God save us all.

478
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:50,118
Up the ladders, lads!
To the safety of the parapets!

479
01:13:01,165 --> 01:13:03,463
Say hello to the 21st century.

480
01:13:16,547 --> 01:13:19,141
Come on! I got plenty for everybody!

481
01:13:28,058 --> 01:13:30,652
-How do you like this?
-Play dead!

482
01:13:33,397 --> 01:13:35,797
<i>It's the one in the cart we want. Get him!</i>

483
01:13:53,884 --> 01:13:55,909
<i>Sayonara, sucker!</i>

484
01:14:02,593 --> 01:14:03,753
<i>Why, you....</i>

485
01:14:05,763 --> 01:14:08,231
<i>You can run, but you can't hide!</i>

486
01:14:34,492 --> 01:14:35,686
Sheila?

487
01:15:01,018 --> 01:15:03,509
<i>-We've secured the courtyard, my lord.
-Excellent.</i>

488
01:15:04,388 --> 01:15:07,152
Now I will have that book.
Storm the walls!

489
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:08,717
Ladders!

490
01:15:08,792 --> 01:15:12,660
<i>Come on, you bony devils! Hurry up!
Or I'll send you to the glue factory!</i>

491
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:13,890
Elmer!

492
01:15:14,698 --> 01:15:16,165
To the walls!

493
01:15:19,436 --> 01:15:22,030
<i>I'll slice you to ribbons! No, no!</i>

494
01:15:46,730 --> 01:15:48,459
Wait! Look out!

495
01:15:55,973 --> 01:15:59,136
<i>-Hey, you're mine, sweetie!
-Get off of her!</i>

496
01:16:06,350 --> 01:16:07,612
Damn you!

497
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:12,881
<i>Defend the Necronomicon, lads!
Or perish in the devil's fire!</i>

498
01:16:17,561 --> 01:16:20,257
-My lord.
-Stay with the book!

499
01:16:20,464 --> 01:16:22,329
The book will be ours!

500
01:16:44,755 --> 01:16:45,779
Hello!

501
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:57,927
The book is mine!

502
01:17:02,573 --> 01:17:04,040
There you go!

503
01:17:12,349 --> 01:17:14,374
<i>I'll cut your gizzard out.</i>

504
01:17:15,352 --> 01:17:16,842
<i>Where'd he go?</i>

505
01:17:27,965 --> 01:17:29,432
Come to Papa!

506
01:17:30,701 --> 01:17:31,929
Get him!

507
01:18:02,066 --> 01:18:06,435
<i>Crazy bitch, get off me!
You're tearing my eyes out!</i>

508
01:18:07,705 --> 01:18:09,036
You witch!

509
01:18:15,879 --> 01:18:16,868
Right.

510
01:18:24,421 --> 01:18:26,548
You found me beautiful once.

511
01:18:27,224 --> 01:18:29,749
Honey, you got real ugly.

512
01:18:49,079 --> 01:18:50,671
There we are.

513
01:18:59,556 --> 01:19:01,456
You wanna play rough?

514
01:19:12,803 --> 01:19:14,031
All right!

515
01:19:37,394 --> 01:19:39,055
<i>You're going down!</i>

516
01:19:40,164 --> 01:19:42,655
<i>-I'm going up!
-I'm coming for you!</i>

517
01:20:14,031 --> 01:20:15,157
Get him!

518
01:20:17,601 --> 01:20:18,761
Excuse me!

519
01:20:18,902 --> 01:20:20,733
Come on! All right!

520
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:26,400
<i>You're pissin' me off,
you ugly son of a bitch!</i>

521
01:20:29,112 --> 01:20:30,136
No!

522
01:20:48,565 --> 01:20:51,432
<i>I'll spoil those good looks!</i>

523
01:20:54,538 --> 01:20:56,005
Backstabber!

524
01:21:01,578 --> 01:21:02,943
Hold still!

525
01:21:17,895 --> 01:21:19,954
Tallyho!

526
01:21:27,404 --> 01:21:32,171
<i>-We can't hold the battlements!
-We will hold! We must protect the book!</i>

527
01:21:32,442 --> 01:21:35,036
<i>Where's Henry the Red? Why's he not....</i>

528
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:39,214
We are deserted!

529
01:21:40,617 --> 01:21:42,278
<i>We're overwhelmed!</i>

530
01:22:04,508 --> 01:22:06,738
I got a bone to pick with you.

531
01:22:07,377 --> 01:22:08,605
Come on!

532
01:22:15,619 --> 01:22:17,746
<i>I'll slice your gizzard open!</i>

533
01:22:34,871 --> 01:22:36,395
<i>Now you're mine!</i>

534
01:22:43,413 --> 01:22:44,437
No!

535
01:22:58,128 --> 01:22:59,117
Why, you...

536
01:22:59,196 --> 01:23:03,565
<i>Let go of the sword!
I'll cut your throat out if I get the chance.</i>

537
01:23:26,256 --> 01:23:27,848
I have the book!

538
01:23:34,031 --> 01:23:35,828
I possess the Necronomicon!

539
01:23:35,899 --> 01:23:39,835
<i>I've crushed your pathetic army!
Now I'll have my vengeance!</i>

540
01:23:39,903 --> 01:23:43,805
The Red! The Red!
Duke Henry and his men have come!

541
01:23:43,907 --> 01:23:48,241
For king and castle! Cry havoc!

542
01:23:48,879 --> 01:23:53,646
Blows, blood, and death!

543
01:23:57,421 --> 01:23:59,013
We are saved!

544
01:24:09,933 --> 01:24:13,994
Onward, valiant cousins!
Their ranks are broke!

545
01:24:15,405 --> 01:24:16,804
Bloody hell!

546
01:24:17,707 --> 01:24:21,973
<i>You've spoiled my plan for conquest!
And now you're going to die!</i>

547
01:24:22,612 --> 01:24:25,809
<i>Buckle up, bonehead!
Because you're going for a ride!</i>

548
01:24:41,164 --> 01:24:42,756
Victory is ours!

549
01:25:09,693 --> 01:25:13,129
<i>-If it's a fight you want...
-Well, start something!</i>

550
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:16,522
<i>-Stand ready, lads!
-We're ready for you!</i>

551
01:26:09,419 --> 01:26:10,943
Move yourself, lad.

552
01:26:11,288 --> 01:26:12,880
-Your hand, man.
-Hey, Henry.

553
01:26:12,956 --> 01:26:14,924
<i>-The debt's paid.
-You had us going.</i>

554
01:26:14,991 --> 01:26:16,322
-Milady.
-Arthur.

555
01:26:16,393 --> 01:26:19,089
<i>-Well won, my friend.
-We've won the day!</i>

556
01:26:25,669 --> 01:26:29,833
<i>We're brothers now!
A new kingdom shall be born!</i>

557
01:26:32,876 --> 01:26:37,108
The book tells us that each drop
allows a man to sleep for a century.

558
01:26:37,814 --> 01:26:41,910
Swallow six drops,
thou shall awaken in thine own time.

559
01:27:46,283 --> 01:27:48,046
God bless you, sire.

560
01:28:29,592 --> 01:28:31,219
Six drops.

561
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:38,564
One, two, three, four...

562
01:28:39,602 --> 01:28:40,591
...five.

563
01:28:48,745 --> 01:28:50,144
Five.

564
01:28:51,648 --> 01:28:52,637
Six.

565
01:30:10,727 --> 01:30:12,092
<i>I'm home.</i>

566
01:30:31,581 --> 01:30:33,446
Manufactured products!

567
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:50,422
God! No! No!

568
01:30:50,733 --> 01:30:53,361
I slept too long!
