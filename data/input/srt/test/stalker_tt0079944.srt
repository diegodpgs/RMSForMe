00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,420
"What was it?
A meteorite?

21
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,940
A visit of inhabitants
of the cosmic abyss?

22
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,940
One way or another,
our small country

23
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,140
has seen the birth of a miracle -
the Zone.

24
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,340
We immediately sent troops there.

25
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,540
They haven't come back.

26
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,620
Then we surrounded the Zone
with police cordons...

27
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,820
Perhaps, that was the right thing to
do. Though, I don't know..."

28
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,940
From an interview with Nobel Prize
winner, Professor Wallace.

29
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,820
Why did you take my watch?

30
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,540
Where are you going, I'm asking you?

31
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,820
You gave me your word
and I believed you.

32
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,020
All right, you're not thinking about
yourself, but what about us?

33
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,540
Did you think about your child?

34
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,540
She's just getting used to you,
and you start it again!

35
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,220
You've made an old woman of me.
You've ruined my life.

36
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,140
Not so loud, you'll wake up
Monkey.

37
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,220
I can't wait for you forever.
I'm going to die!

38
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,820
You wanted to start working!

39
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,140
You've been promised
a normal human work!

40
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,660
I'll be back soon.

41
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,340
You'll be back to prison!

42
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,140
Though this time you'll get
ten years, not five!

43
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,540
And for ten years you will have
neither your Zone, nor anything!

44
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,020
And I'll be dead in the meantime.

45
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,540
Oh God, for me it's prison
everywhere!

46
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,820
- Let me go!
- No!

47
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,540
Let go, I said!

48
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,780
Go!
And may you rot there!

49
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,220
Be damned the day
when I met you, bastard!

50
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,780
God himself has cursed you
by giving you this child!

51
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,940
And me too, because of you, jerk!

52
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,020
My dear,
our world is hopelessly boring.

53
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,540
Therefore, there can be no telepathy,
or apparitions, or flying saucers,

54
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,820
nothing like that.

55
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:44,020
The world is ruled by cast-iron laws,
and it's insufferably boring.

56
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,420
Alas, those laws are never violated.

57
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,380
They don't know how to be violated.

58
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,540
So don't even hope for a UFO,
that would have been too interesting.

59
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,740
And how about the Bermuda Triangle?
You're not going to deny...

60
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,660
I am. There is no Bermuda Triangle.

61
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,540
There's only Triangle ABC that equals
Triangle A-prim, B-prim, C-prim.

62
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,540
Do you feel the boredom
contained in this assertion?

63
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,980
To live in the Middle Ages was
interesting.

64
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,780
Every home had its house-spirit,
and every church had its God.

65
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,220
People were young!
Now every fourth is an old person.

66
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,540
It's so boring, my angel.

67
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,740
But you said that the Zone

68
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,220
was the product of a superior
civilization...

69
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,820
It must be boring, too,
all those laws, triangles,

70
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,740
and no house spirits,
and no God, that's for certain.

71
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,020
Because if God is also
a triangle,

72
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,420
then I don't know what to think.

73
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,540
It's for me! Great!

74
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,220
Goodbye, my dear friend.

75
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,220
This lady was so kind as to agree
to go with us to the Zone.

76
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,940
She's a very courageous woman.
Her name is...

77
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,140
I beg your pardon, your name is..?

78
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,140
Are you really a stalker?

79
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,140
Wait... I'll explain everything.

80
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,820
Go...

81
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,220
What a cretin!

82
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,340
You did get drunk after all.

83
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,540
Me? What do you mean?

84
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,220
I had a drink, like one half
of the population does.

85
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,220
The other half gets drunk.
Including women and children.

86
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,140
I just had a drink though.

87
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,540
Damn it, what a mess here.

88
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,620
Go on, drink. We've got time.

89
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,540
How about a glass for the road?

90
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,940
What do you think?

91
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,620
Take it away.

92
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,820
I see. Dry law.
Alcoholism is a scourge of mankind.

93
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,940
All right, we'll drink beer.

94
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,140
Is he with us?

95
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,540
Never mind, he'll sober up.
He needs to go there, too.

96
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,420
Are you really a professor?

97
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,940
If you don't mind.

98
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,220
Then let me introduce myself.
My name is...

99
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,820
Your name is Writer.

100
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,740
Well. And what is my name?

101
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,540
Yours? Professor.

102
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,620
I see. I'm a writer,

103
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,620
so, naturally, everyone calls me
Writer for some reason.

104
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,540
- And what do you write about?
- About the readers.

105
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,140
Obviously, there's nothing else
one should write about.

106
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,220
One should write about nothing at all.

107
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,940
And what are you? A chemist?

108
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,540
A physicist rather.

109
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,140
That must be boring, too.
Searching for the truth.

110
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,740
It's hiding and you keep searching
for it.

111
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,740
You dig in one place -- eureka!
The nucleus is made of protons.

112
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,940
You dig in another -- great!

113
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,820
Triangle ABC equals
Triangle A-prim, B-prim, C-prim.

114
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,540
With me it's quite different.

115
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,940
While I am digging for the truth,
so much happens to it

116
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,540
that instead of discovering the truth

117
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,540
I dig up a heap of, pardon...
I'd better not name it.

118
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,940
You're lucky!

119
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,620
But imagine some antique pot
displayed in a museum.

120
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,140
It was used at its time
as a receptacle of food leftovers,

121
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,340
but now it's an object of
universal admiration

122
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,540
for its laconic pattern
and unique form.

123
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,740
Everyone goes oh! and ah!

124
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,420
And suddenly it turns out
that it's not antique at all,

125
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,220
that some joker has palmed it off
on the archeologists

126
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,540
just for fun.

127
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,940
Strange as it may seem, the admiration
dies off. Those connoisseurs...

128
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,420
Is it what you think about
all the time?

129
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,140
God forbid!

130
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,220
In fact, I don't think much.
It's not good for me.

131
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,420
It's impossible to write, thinking
all the time of success or failure.

132
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:38,740
Naturlich! But if no one is going
to read me in one hundred years,

133
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,940
why the hell should I write at all?

134
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:47,540
Tell me, Professor, why did you let
yourself be mixed up in all this?

135
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,220
What do you need the Zone for?

136
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,340
I'm a scientist in some sense.

137
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,220
But what do you need it for?

138
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,420
You're an "in" writer.

139
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,340
Women must be running after you
in flocks.

140
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:09,940
My inspiration has been lost,
Professor. I go begging for it.

141
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,540
Have you been used up?

142
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,540
What?
Yes, I guess, in a way.

143
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,740
Do you hear it? Our train.

144
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,740
- Have you taken the roof off the car?
- Yes, I have.

145
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:51,740
Luger, if I don't come back,
call on my wife.

146
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,540
Damn it, I forgot to buy cigarettes.

147
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,820
Don't go back.

148
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,140
- Why?
- You must not.

149
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,140
- You're all like this.
- Like what?

150
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,020
Believing such nonsense.

151
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,540
Well, I'd better leave it for a rainy
day.

152
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,740
Are you really a scientist?

153
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,340
Down!

154
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,220
Don't move!

155
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,540
Go and look, is there anyone there?

156
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,140
Move it, for God's sake!

157
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,020
There's no one there.

158
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,140
Go to the other exit.

159
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,020
Where on earth did you look, Writer?

160
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:32,340
- You didn't forget the jerry can?
- No. It's full.

161
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,860
Everything I told you before...

162
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,340
is a lie.
I don't give a damn about inspiration.

163
00:26:54,620 --> 00:27:00,540
How would I know
the right word for what I want?

164
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,940
How would I know that actually
I don't want what I want?

165
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:09,740
Or that I actually don't want
what I don't want?

166
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,820
They are elusive things:

167
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,140
the moment we name them,
their meaning disappears,

168
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,540
melts, dissolves
like a jellyfish in the sun.

169
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,140
My conscience wants vegetarianism
to win over the world.

170
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,620
And my subconscious is yearning
for a piece of juicy meat.

171
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,340
But what do I want?

172
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,540
World domination.

173
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,420
Quiet!

174
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,620
Why a diesel locomotive in the Zone?

175
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,940
It services the outpost.
It won't go any farther.

176
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,620
They don't like going there.

177
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,540
Take your places!
Everybody here?

178
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,940
The guards have arrived.
Tell them to turn the TV off.

179
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,540
Hurry!

180
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:07,540
Go look if there’s a trolley
on the tracks.

181
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,940
What trolley?

182
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,820
Go back, I'll do it.

183
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,820
The jerry can!

184
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,740
Give it to me!

185
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,540
Get rid of your knapsack,
it's hampering you.

186
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,140
You may travel light, if you wish,
as if going for a stroll.

187
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,940
If someone gets hit,
don't shout or rush about.

188
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,220
If they see you, they'll kill you.

189
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,820
When everything settles down,
crawl back to the outpost.

190
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,020
They'll pick you up in the morning.

191
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,740
Can they catch up with us?

192
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,940
They fear it like the plague.

193
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,420
Fear what?

194
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,940
Here we are... home, at last.

195
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,020
How quiet it is.

196
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:03,540
This is the quietest place in
the world. You'll see for yourselves.

197
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,940
So beautiful here.
Not a single soul here.

198
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,940
What about us?

199
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,940
Three men can't spoil the place
in one day.

200
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,220
Why? They can.

201
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:24,540
It's strange that flowers don't
smell. Or have l...

202
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,940
Do you feel anything?

203
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,420
I feel the stench of the bog.

204
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,020
No, that's the river. There's a river
here.

205
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:39,140
There was a flower-bed nearby,
but Porcupine had trampled it down.

206
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:44,420
The smell lingered
for many years though.

207
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,540
Why did he do it?

208
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,540
I don't know.

209
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,340
I asked him why, too.

210
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,420
And he said:
"You'll understand later."

211
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,540
I think he just came to hate the Zone.

212
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,540
Porcupine, that's his name?

213
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,820
A nickname, like yours.

214
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,420
He had been taking people to the Zone
for years, and no one could stop him.

215
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,740
He was my teacher.
He opened my eyes.

216
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:31,140
He was called Teacher then,
not Porcupine.

217
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:38,020
Then something happened to him,
something broke in him.

218
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,020
Though I think
he was punished.

219
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:46,140
Will you help me? Tie those strips
of bandage to the nuts.

220
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:50,820
And l... will go for a walk.

221
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,140
I need to do something...

222
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,740
Don't go anywhere.

223
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,940
Where's he going?

224
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,540
He wants to be alone, I guess.

225
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:25,020
Why? Even with the three of us
together, I feel weird.

226
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,940
A date with the Zone.
He's a stalker.

227
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,420
And what does that mean?

228
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:38,140
You see, being a stalker
is some sort of calling.

229
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,540
- I thought he'd be different.
- Like what?

230
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,940
Well, you know, the Leather Stockings,
Chingachgook sort of things...

231
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:50,220
His background is even more frightful.

232
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,940
Several times in prison,
then he was harmed here.

233
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,820
He has a mutant daughter,
"a victim of the Zone" as they call it.

234
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,220
They say she's got no legs.

235
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,020
And what about this Porcupine?

236
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,420
What does it mean, "was punished"?

237
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,020
Or was it just a figure of speech?

238
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:19,540
One day Porcupine returned from here

239
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,820
and got rich overnight.

240
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,340
Fabulously rich.

241
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,140
You call it punishment?

242
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,140
A week later he hanged himself.

243
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,940
Why?

244
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,740
Quiet!

245
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,540
What was that?

246
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:36,140
Presumably a meteorite fell down
here about twenty years ago.

247
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,540
It had burned down the settlement.

248
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:44,820
They searched for this meteorite,
but never found it, of course.

249
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,740
Why "of course"?

250
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,580
Then people began disappearing here.

251
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,140
They came here and never returned.

252
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,220
So it was concluded...

253
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:04,540
that this meteorite
was not really a meteorite.

254
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,020
At first...

255
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:14,940
they circled the place with barbed
wire to scare off the inquisitive.

256
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:22,460
All this gave rise to rumours
that there's a place in the Zone...

257
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,460
where wishes come true.

258
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:34,340
Naturally, they began to guard
the Zone like the apple of their eye.

259
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,820
Who knows what kind offish
someone might cherish.

260
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:43,620
What was it if not a meteorite?

261
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,540
I told you, no one knows.

262
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,420
And what do you think?

263
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:57,420
Nothing.
Or anything.

264
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:03,420
A message to mankind,
as one of my colleagues says.

265
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,540
Or a gift.

266
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,180
Some gift.

267
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,540
Why on earth would they do it?

268
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,340
To make us happy.

269
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:25,620
The flowers are blooming again,
but they don't smell for some reason.

270
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:31,580
Sorry for leaving you two here,
but it was too early to go anyway.

271
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,020
Did you hear it?

272
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,420
Maybe someone lives here?

273
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,820
Who?

274
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:47,220
You told me yourself

275
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:51,940
about some tourists camped here
when the Zone originated.

276
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,020
There's no one in the Zone and
there can't be.

277
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,540
Well, it's time.

278
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:48,540
How are we going to return?

279
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:52,940
- They don't return here.
- What do you mean?

280
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,220
We'll go as we agreed.

281
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,940
I'll show the direction.

282
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,580
Any deviation from it is dangerous.

283
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,340
The first landmark is that last pole.

284
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:15,420
You go first, Professor.

285
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,620
Now you.

286
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,940
Try to follow in his footsteps.

287
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:57,540
Oh, my God! And where are...

288
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:02,180
Did they remain here like that?
Those people?

289
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,940
Who knows.

290
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:10,420
I remember them packing at the station,
getting ready to come here.

291
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,820
I was just a boy.

292
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:17,540
We all thought then
that somebody wanted to conquer us.

293
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,740
You first, Professor.

294
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,220
Now you, Writer.

295
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:03,820
Your room is over there.
We'll go this way.

296
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:09,220
Why were you hiking up the price?
It's so close at hand.

297
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:13,820
Yes, but the hand
has to be very long.

298
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:16,820
We don't have such a hand.

299
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:23,540
Don't! Leave it alone!

300
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,420
Don't touch it!

301
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,740
Don't touch it, I said!

302
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:36,580
Are you crazy? What's the matter
with you?

303
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:41,140
It's not the place for leisurely
strolls.

304
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,140
The Zone wants to be respected.
Otherwise it will punish.

305
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:50,340
Don't you ever try it again...
Have you no tongue or what?

306
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:53,620
I warned you, didn't l?

307
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,420
Are we to go there?

308
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,940
Yes. Up, enter it and to the left.

309
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:05,620
Only we are not going this way.
We'll go around.

310
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,140
Why?

311
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:10,820
People don't go this way.

312
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:15,140
In the Zone, the longer way,
the less risk.

313
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:18,140
And to go straight ahead is fatal?

314
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,940
He told you it's dangerous.

315
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:23,540
- And making a detour's not dangerous?
- It is. But they don't go this way.

316
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:26,740
What do I care that they don't?
What if I take a chance...

317
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,420
Listen, what's the matter with you...

318
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:31,820
To go all the way around!
When everything's so close.

319
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:35,540
Here a risk, there a risk.
What the hell!

320
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:38,820
You're being very flippant
about this.

321
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:43,340
I'm fed up with all those nuts
and bandages.

322
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:47,140
You may do as you wish,
but I'm going.

323
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,340
- You're insane.
- It's you who are...

324
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:52,620
May l?

325
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:05,740
The wind is coming up...

326
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:10,140
Can you feel it? The grass...

327
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:21,940
All the more so.

328
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,020
What do you mean?

329
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,020
Wait!

330
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:42,540
Keep your hands off!

331
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:50,140
Professor be my witness,
I didn't sent you there.

332
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:52,420
You go of your own will.

333
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,540
Of my own will. What else?

334
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,940
Nothing. Go.

335
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,340
God help you to be lucky.

336
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:22,140
Listen!

337
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:25,340
Should you notice something,

338
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:28,820
or just feel something,

339
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,540
go back at once, or...

340
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:34,420
Just don't throw iron poles at me.

341
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:42,220
Stop! Don't move!

342
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:50,140
- Why did you do it?
- Why did I do what?

343
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:55,540
- Why did you stop him?
- I thought it was you...

344
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:37,740
What's up?
Why did you stop me?

345
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:39,940
I didn't stop you.

346
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:42,220
Who did it then? You?

347
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,140
Who the hell knows...

348
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:53,020
You're smart, Mister Shakespeare.

349
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,940
To go straight ahead is scary,
to go back is embarrassing.

350
00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:01,620
So you gave yourself a command.
Fear has made you come to your senses.

351
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:03,940
- What?
- Stop it.

352
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:07,540
- Why have you emptied the bottle?
- Stop it, I said!

353
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:27,140
The Zone is a very complicated system...

354
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:33,540
of traps,
and they're all deadly.

355
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:39,020
I don't know what's going on here
in the absence of people,

356
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:44,940
but the moment someone shows up,
everything comes into motion.

357
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:50,020
Old traps disappear
and new ones emerge.

358
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:54,340
Safe spots
become impassable.

359
00:59:56,020 --> 01:00:00,740
Now your path is easy,
now it's hopelessly involved.

360
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:06,540
That's the Zone.

361
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:11,220
It may even seem capricious.

362
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:16,540
But it is what we've made it
with our condition.

363
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:24,620
It happened that people had
to stop halfway and go back.

364
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:29,340
Some of them even died
on the very threshold of the room.

365
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:33,540
But everything that's going on here
depends not on the Zone, but on us!

366
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:37,540
So it lets the good ones pass
and kills the bad ones?

367
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:40,540
I don't know.

368
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,940
I think
it lets those pass who...

369
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,940
have lost all hope.

370
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:50,140
Not good or bad,
but wretched people.

371
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:55,340
But even the most wretched will die
if they don't know how to behave.

372
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:08,340
You have been lucky,
it just warned you.

373
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:15,420
I guess I'll wait for you here

374
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:21,340
until you come back,
made happy.

375
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:23,620
It's impossible!

376
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:26,820
I've got sandwiches, a thermos...

377
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:29,420
You won't last even an hour here
without me.

378
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:32,940
Besides, one doesn't return here
the way one comes.

379
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:37,140
Anyway, I would prefer...

380
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:39,540
Then we're going back right away.

381
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:44,140
I'll return your money
minus a certain sum

382
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,220
for the trouble, so to speak...

383
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:49,140
Have you come to your senses,
Professor?

384
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:56,940
All right. Go on, throw your nut.

385
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:51,240
Part Two

386
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:59,040
STALKER

387
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,720
Where are you?
Come here!

388
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,320
Are you tired?

389
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,240
Oh, God!

390
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,920
Judging by his tone, he's going to
start sermonizing again.

391
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,240
Let everything that's been planned
come true.

392
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,440
Let them believe.

393
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:05,120
And let them have a laugh
at their passions.

394
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:09,920
Because what they call passion
actually is not some emotional energy,

395
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,440
but just the friction between
their souls and the outside world.

396
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,640
And most important,
let them believe in themselves

397
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:21,720
Let them be helpless like children,

398
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,120
because weakness is a great thing,
and strength is nothing.

399
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,840
When a man is just born,
he is weak and flexible,

400
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:37,240
when he dies,
he is hard and insensitive.

401
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:41,640
When a tree is growing,
it's tender and pliant,

402
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:46,040
but when it's dry and hard,
it dies.

403
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,240
Hardness and strength
are death's companions.

404
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,440
Pliancy and weakness are
expressions of the freshness of being.

405
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:02,240
Because what has hardened
will never win.

406
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:26,520
Come here!
We're progressing well.

407
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,240
Soon we'll come to a dry tunnel,
after that it will get easier.

408
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,240
Knock on wood.

409
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:36,040
- Are we on our way already?
- Of course. Why?

410
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:40,720
I thought you just wanted
to show us something.

411
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:44,240
- What about my knapsack?
- What about it?

412
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:48,240
I left it there.
I didn't know we were going.

413
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:53,040
- There's nothing we can do about it.
- No, we have to go back.

414
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,840
- It's impossible!
- I can't do without my knapsack!

415
01:05:56,040 --> 01:06:00,040
Can't you understand that no one here
has ever come back the same way?

416
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:05,440
Forget about your knapsack.
What have you got there, diamonds?

417
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:09,040
The room will give you
anything you want.

418
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:13,040
Really. It will drown you
in knapsacks.

419
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,320
How far is it, this room?

420
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:20,240
If you go straight, about 200 meters,
but there's no going straight here.

421
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:21,640
Let's go.

422
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:28,440
Give up your empiricism, Professor.
Miracles are outside empiricism.

423
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,440
Remember how St. Peter
was nearly drowned?

424
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,240
Go, Writer.

425
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,640
Go where?

426
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,040
Up these stairs.

427
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,040
Professor, where are you?

428
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:45,840
Here is the dry tunnel!

429
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:48,040
You call it dry?

430
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:54,240
This is a local joke.
Normally one has to swim here.

431
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,240
Wait, where's Professor?

432
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:27,520
- What?
- Professor has disappeared!

433
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:31,840
How could it happen?
He was following you all the way.

434
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:35,920
He probably lagged behind and
lost his way.

435
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:39,640
No, he didn't lose his way!
He must've gone for the knapsack!

436
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,720
He won't be able to make it now.

437
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:44,440
Shall we wait for him?

438
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:49,440
We can't. Things change here
every minute. We'll have to go.

439
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,520
Look! What is it? How could it be?

440
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:24,120
- I already explained.
- What did you explain?

441
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:29,640
It's the Zone, don't you understand?
Let's go, quick. It's...

442
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,040
There he is!

443
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,640
I'm certainly grateful to you
that you... but...

444
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,440
How did you get here?

445
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:17,440
Mostly I had to crawl up here
on my fours.

446
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,240
Incredible.
How did you manage to overtake us?

447
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:28,320
What do you mean, "overtake"?
I came back here for the knapsack.

448
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,640
And how has our nut gotten here?

449
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:39,520
Oh, my God, that's...
the trap!

450
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:47,320
Porcupine put this nut here
on purpose.

451
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:54,640
How could the Zone let us through?

452
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:05,640
Oh God, I'm not going
to take one more step until...

453
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,240
I don't like it.

454
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:17,040
That's it! We rest!

455
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:33,640
But keep off this nut,
just in case.

456
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:38,720
Sorry, but I thought that
Professor won't be able to make it.

457
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:40,240
You see, l...

458
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:45,640
I never know beforehand what kind
of people I'm taking with me.

459
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:50,440
Everything gets clear only here,
when it's too late.

460
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:56,720
What's important is that Professor's
bag with his underwear is safe.

461
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:02,640
Don't stick your nose in someone's
underwear if you don't understand it.

462
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:07,640
What is there to understand?
Binomial theorem?

463
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,720
Some psychological abysses!

464
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,520
You have a bad reputation
at your institute.

465
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:17,240
They don't give you money
for an expedition.

466
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:22,440
So you decide to pack a knapsack
full of manometers and other shit...

467
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:26,240
penetrate the Zone illegally...

468
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,240
and put all these miracles
to an algebra test.

469
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:35,840
No one in the world
has ever heard of the Zone.

470
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,240
So we'll work a sure sensation!

471
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:44,640
The television, fans raving
and bringing laurel wreaths.

472
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:49,920
Here our Professor appears,
all in white,

473
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:54,720
and declares:
"Mene-mene, tekel, uprasin."

474
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,240
Everyone gaping

475
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:02,640
and shouting:
"He deserves a Nobel Prize!"

476
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:10,520
You lousy scribbler,
a homespun psychoanalyst.

477
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:17,040
You're only good for painting walls
in public toilets, you blabbermouth.

478
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,920
No good. Too sluggish.

479
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:25,840
You don't know how to do it.

480
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:29,240
All right. I'm going to get
a Nobel Prize.

481
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:34,440
And what are you after?
Want to bless mankind

482
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:38,040
with the pearls
of your purchased inspiration?

483
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:43,240
I don't care a damn about mankind.
Of all your mankind

484
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:48,040
I'm interested
only in one man -- myself.

485
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:53,040
Whether I'm worth anything
or I'm just shit like others.

486
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:57,920
And if you find out
that you're really...

487
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:02,840
You know, Mr. Einstein,
I have no wish to argue with you.

488
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,720
Truth is born of argument,
damn it!

489
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,520
Listen, Chingachgook...

490
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:22,640
You've brought here
many people.

491
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,040
Not as many as I would like.

492
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:32,920
That's not the point. Why did they
come here? What did they want?

493
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,040
Happiness, I guess.

494
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:38,840
Yes, but what kind of happiness?

495
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:44,040
People don't like to speak about
their innermost feelings.

496
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,320
And it's neither yours
nor mine business.

497
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,840
In any case, you've been lucky.

498
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:56,040
As for me, I haven't seen
one happy man in my life.

499
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,920
Me neither.

500
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,520
They return from the room
and I lead them back,

501
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:04,320
and we never see each other again.

502
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:09,240
It's not that wishes come true
immediately.

503
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:16,440
Have you ever wished
to use this room yourself?

504
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,920
I'm fine as I am.

505
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:15,840
Listen, Professor.

506
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:21,040
Speaking of the purchased inspiration.

507
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:26,040
Let's imagine that I enter this room

508
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:30,440
and return to our God-forsaken
town a genius.

509
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:41,520
A man writes because he's tormented,
because he doubts.

510
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:47,640
He needs to constantly prove
to himself and the others

511
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,520
that he's worth something.

512
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:54,920
And if I know for sure
that I'm a genius?

513
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,240
Why write then?

514
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,240
What the hell for?

515
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:09,040
Well, I must say

516
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,840
that we exist for...

517
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:15,240
Will you be so kind
and leave me alone?

518
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:21,040
Let me get a wink,
I haven't slept all night.

519
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:24,440
Keep your complexes to yourself.

520
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:30,240
In any case,
all this technology of yours...

521
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,840
all those blast furnaces, wheels...

522
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,840
and other bullshit

523
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:45,440
are only designed in order
to work less and eat more.

524
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,720
They are all just crutches,
artificial limbs.

525
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:56,240
And mankind exists
in order to create...

526
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,840
works of art.

527
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:07,720
Unlike all other human activities,
this one is unselfish.

528
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:14,840
Great illusions!
Images of the absolute truth!

529
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:19,120
Are you listening to me, Professor?

530
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,320
What unselfishness are you talking
about?

531
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:27,840
People still die of hunger.
Have you fallen from the moon?

532
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:40,240
And they are considered to be
our brainy aristocracy!

533
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:45,120
You're not even capable of thinking
in abstractions.

534
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:52,240
Are you going to teach me
about the meaning of life?

535
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,520
And also how to think?

536
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:04,440
It's useless. You might be
a professor, but an ignorant one.

537
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:56,520
And there was
a great earthquake.

538
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:01,120
And the sun became black
as sackcloth made of hair.

539
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:04,240
And the moon became like blood...

540
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:09,520
And the stars of the sky
fell to the earth,

541
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:13,840
as a fig tree casts
its unripe figs

542
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:17,320
when shaken by a great wind.

543
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,720
And the sky was split apart
like a scroll when it is rolled up.

544
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:28,720
And every mountain and island
were moved out of their places.

545
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:37,120
And the kings of the earth and
the great men

546
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:41,920
and the rich and the chiliarchs

547
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:47,240
and the strong and every free man,

548
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:51,520
hid themselves in the caves
and among the rocks of the mountains;

549
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:55,840
and they said to the mountains and
to the rocks, "Fall on us

550
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:59,720
and hide us from the presence of
Him who sits on the throne,

551
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:02,520
and from the wrath of the Lamb,

552
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:06,440
for the great day of His wrath
has come,

553
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:10,840
and who is able to stand?"

554
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,840
And that very day two...

555
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:09,920
two of them...

556
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:15,920
were going to a village
which was about 60 stadia from...

557
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,240
named...

558
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:22,720
and they were conversing with each
other about all these things.

559
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,240
And while they were conversing
and discussing...

560
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:30,280
He Himself approached,
and began travelling with them.

561
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:34,920
But their eyes were prevented
from recognizing Him.

562
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,360
And He said to them:
"What are these words...

563
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,440
you are exchanging with one another,
and why are you sad?"

564
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,560
And one of them, named...

565
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:01,720
Are you awake?

566
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,920
You were speaking of the meaning...

567
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:13,720
of our... Life...

568
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:16,720
of the unselfishness of art...

569
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:22,240
Take music, for instance.

570
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:31,240
Less than anything else,
it is connected to reality,

571
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:35,720
or if connected at all, it's done
mechanically, not by way of ideas,

572
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:39,520
just by a sheer sound, devoid of...
any associations.

573
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:49,840
And yet, music, as if by some miracle,
gets through to our heart.

574
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:57,160
What is it that resonates in us in
response to noise brought to harmony,

575
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:02,120
making it the source
of the greatest delight

576
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,840
which stuns us and brings us
together?

577
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:10,440
What's all this needed for?
And most important, who needs it?

578
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:17,160
You would say,
"No one. And for no reason."

579
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:18,720
Unselfishly.

580
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:21,560
No.

581
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,520
I don't think so.

582
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,920
After all,
everything has some sense.

583
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:35,240
Sense and reason.

584
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:06,520
Do we have to go there?

585
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:12,920
Unfortunately, yes.
There's no other way.

586
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:32,120
It looks morbid, don't you think,
Professor?

587
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:38,840
I don't feel like going there first.

588
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,520
And Chingachgooks
can never be volunteers.

589
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:48,840
I think we'll have to draw lots.
Do you mind?

590
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:52,520
For this, I would rather have
a volunteer.

591
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:56,520
Have you got matches?

592
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:05,640
Thanks.

593
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,240
The long one will go.

594
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:23,520
Pull it.

595
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:33,960
The long one.
No luck this time.

596
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:51,240
Why don't you throw one of your nuts
at least?

597
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,520
Sure. As you wish.

598
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:30,880
One more?

599
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:43,520
All right... I'll go.

600
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:27,920
Hurry up, Professor!

601
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:34,840
There's... There's a door here!

602
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:55,960
Go that way!
Open the door and go in!

603
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:07,440
Me again?
Do I have to go in first again?

604
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:13,240
You've drawn the lot.
Go! People don't wait here.

605
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:21,840
What have you got there?
No guns here!

606
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:24,920
You'll have yourself killed,
and us too!

607
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:26,920
Don't you remember the tanks?

608
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:29,840
Drop it, I beg you.

609
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:31,920
Don't you understand?

610
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:37,320
If something happens,
I can save you, but not this way...

611
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:45,280
I beg you!
Who are you going to fire at?

612
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:00,320
Go, we haven't got much time!

613
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:05,720
There's water here!

614
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:09,520
Hold on to the handrail and go down.

615
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:57,920
But don't go anywhere!
Wait for us outside!

616
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:14,040
I hope you haven't got anything
like that?

617
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:17,520
- Like what?
- Like a gun.

618
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:20,720
No. As a last resort
I've got an ampule.

619
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:25,840
- What ampule?
- Implanted ampule. Poison!

620
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:29,040
Oh, God! Did you come here to die?

621
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:37,640
No, it's just in case.

622
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:05,840
Writer! Come back!

623
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:08,440
Come back! You want to get yourself
killed?

624
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:13,040
I told you to wait by the exit!
Stop! Don't move!

625
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:59,080
That's all your pipe.

626
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:03,240
- Why?
- You should've gone in there first.

627
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:07,240
He was so scared that he went
the wrong way.

628
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:51,920
One more experiment.

629
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:59,680
Experiments, facts,
truth of the highest instance.

630
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:04,680
There's no such thing as facts.
Especially here.

631
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:10,840
All this is someone's
idiotic invention.

632
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:12,920
Don't you feel it?

633
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:18,360
But you, of course, must find out
whose invention it is.

634
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:22,160
And why.

635
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:25,640
What good can your knowledge do?

636
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:29,840
Who is going to get guilty conscience
because of it? Me?

637
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:34,320
I've got no conscience.
I just got nerves.

638
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:37,920
Some bastard would criticize me,
I get wounded.

639
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:41,440
Another would loud me,
I get wounded again.

640
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:46,920
I would put my heart and soul in it,
they gobble up both my heart and soul.

641
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:52,040
I would relieve my soul of filth,
they gobble it up too.

642
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:55,520
They're all so literate.

643
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,120
They all got sensory deficiency.

644
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:05,440
And they're all swarming around,
journalists,

645
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:10,520
editors, critics,
some endless broads.

646
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:14,080
And they all demand:
more, more!

647
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:22,760
What hell of a writer am I
if I hate writing?

648
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:28,720
If it's constant torment for me,
a painful, shameful occupation,

649
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:31,240
sort of squeezing out a hemorrhoids.

650
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:37,920
I used to think that someone would
get better because of my books.

651
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:40,040
No, nobody needs me!

652
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:45,240
In two days after I die they'll start
gobbling up someone else.

653
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:52,320
I wanted to change them,
but it's they who've changed me.

654
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:55,280
Making me in their own image.

655
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:04,640
The future used to be just
a continuation of the present,

656
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:08,440
with all the changes looming far
behind the horizon.

657
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:12,120
Now the future and the present
are one.

658
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:21,560
Are they ready for it?

659
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:26,520
They don't want to know anything!
All they know is how to gobble!

660
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:42,120
Gosh, how lucky you are!

661
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:47,760
My goodness, now...
You're going to live a hundred years!

662
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:05,120
Yes. But why not forever?

663
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:09,680
Like the eternal Jew.

664
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:52,240
You are probably a fine man.

665
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:54,240
I almost didn't doubt it.

666
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:58,640
I can imagine what torture it was
for you being in there.

667
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:03,240
This pipe is a horrible place!
The most horrible in the Zone!

668
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:06,240
It's called "the meat mincer",
but it's much worse than any mincer.

669
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:08,360
So many people perished there!

670
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:16,480
Porcupine sent his brother
to die there.

671
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:21,840
The boy was so delicate,
very talented.

672
01:47:24,440 --> 01:47:25,840
Here, listen to this.

673
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:31,720
So summer is gone,
Leaving no epitaph.

674
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:36,840
It's still warm in the sun,
Only that's not enough.

675
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:39,840
All that true could have come,

676
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:44,520
Like a five-fingered fluff,
Folded into my palm,

677
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:47,520
Only that's not enough.

678
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:52,720
No evil was slighted
in the good aftermath,

679
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:57,840
World was festively lighted,
Only that's not enough.

680
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:03,240
Life forever was tucking,
Caring, making me laugh.

681
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:08,040
I was really lucky,
Only that's not enough.

682
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:13,440
No leaves ever seared,
No limbs broken rough.

683
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:19,240
Day, like glass, washed all clear,
Only that's not enough.

684
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:23,840
Good, aren't they?
That's his verses.

685
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:27,520
Why do you fidget?
Fussing all the time?

686
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:30,040
- I'm just...
- I get sick just looking at you!

687
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:35,040
I'm so happy! It's not often that
everyone who goes makes it.

688
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:39,080
You did everything right.
You're good, kind, honest people.

689
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:40,640
I'm proud that I was right about you.

690
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:44,040
Look at him! He's happy
that everything ended well!

691
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:48,720
Fate! Zone!
I'm a fine man, he says!

692
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:51,720
You think I didn't see how you
shoved the two long matches at me?

693
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:54,440
- No, you don't understand...
- Of course, how could l?

694
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:58,440
I'm sorry, Professor,
no offense meant,

695
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:00,520
but this jerk has chosen you
to be his favorite.

696
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:01,920
Come on, it's unfair!

697
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:05,840
And me, a second-rate creature,
he shoves into that pipe!

698
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:08,960
Meat mincer! To think of such
a word!

699
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:12,160
What right have you got to decide

700
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:14,840
who is to live and
who is to go into the meat mincer?

701
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:16,920
You've chosen it yourself!

702
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:21,240
What? One long match out of the two
long ones?

703
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:23,520
The matches are nothing.

704
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:26,640
The Zone had let you through
earlier, under the nut,

705
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:30,720
so it became clear that only you
could go through the meat mincer.

706
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:32,240
And we just followed you.

707
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:33,440
Well, it's too much...

708
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:39,040
You can't even imagine how dangerous
it is to make a mistake here.

709
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:42,040
But someone had to be first!

710
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:45,840
Yes? No, it's not a clinic!

711
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:51,240
You see, someone has to go first!

712
01:49:57,920 --> 01:49:58,840
Don't touch it!

713
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:22,040
Laboratory nine, please.

714
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:24,640
Just a minute.

715
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:33,520
- Hello?
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.

716
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:37,920
- What do you want?
- Just a few words with you.

717
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:40,840
You've hidden it. I've found it.

718
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:46,320
The old building. Bunker four.
Do you hear me?

719
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:48,840
I'm alerting the security
immediately.

720
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:54,240
You may do it.
You may inform on me,

721
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:58,320
you may set my colleagues against me,
but it's too late.

722
01:50:58,640 --> 01:51:03,920
I'm now at a stone's throw
from that place.

723
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:07,240
Do you realize that's the end of you
as a scientist?

724
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:08,520
Well, you may rejoice!

725
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:11,840
Do you realize what will happen
if you dare?

726
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:15,240
Trying to scare me again?

727
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:22,720
All my life I've been afraid of
something. Even of you.

728
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:26,240
But now I'm not afraid of anything,
I assure you.

729
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:29,720
Oh God, you are not even
a Herostratos.

730
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:33,240
It's just that you've always wanted
to make my life unbearable

731
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:35,920
because twenty years ago
I slept with your wife.

732
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:40,720
And now you're delighted
that you've made even with me.

733
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:45,240
Well, go and do your...
vile thing.

734
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:48,040
Don't you dare hang up on me!

735
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:52,640
Prison is not the worst thing
expecting you.

736
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:55,920
The worst is that you'll never be
able to forgive yourself for this.

737
01:51:56,120 --> 01:52:00,440
I already see you hanging from your
suspenders in your prison cell.

738
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:06,840
What are you up to, Professor?

739
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:12,640
Do you realize what will happen
when everybody believes in the room?

740
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:17,120
And all come rushing here?

741
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:21,840
It's only a question of time.

742
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:25,320
If not today, then tomorrow!
And not just tens of them, thousands!

743
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:30,120
Unfulfilled emperors,
great inquisitors, fuhrers,

744
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:33,920
self-appointed benefactors
of the human race!

745
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:38,920
And they'll come not for money or
inspiration, but to change the world!

746
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:40,840
I never take here people like that.
You think I don't understand it?

747
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:43,720
What on earth can you understand?

748
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:46,840
You're not the only stalker
on Earth.

749
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:49,240
No stalker can know

750
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:53,120
what those you lead bring with them
and what they take from here.

751
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:56,440
And the number of unmotivated
crimes is on the rise!

752
01:52:56,640 --> 01:52:58,240
Isn't that your doing?

753
01:52:58,440 --> 01:53:03,240
Take coups d'etat by the military,
or the mafia penetrating governments,

754
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:05,040
aren't they all your clients?

755
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:09,520
Or lasers and all those
super-bacteria,

756
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:13,920
all that filth, kept for the time being
in safes?

757
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:16,840
Will you please stop this
sociological diarrhea?

758
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:19,120
Can you really believe
in all those fairy tales?

759
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:23,720
Not in the good ones, no!
But in the bad ones, certainly!

760
01:53:24,040 --> 01:53:25,640
Come on!

761
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:30,720
A human being is not capable
of such hatred or love...

762
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:34,520
that would extend over
the whole of mankind.

763
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:38,840
Well, money, a woman,
maybe a desire for revenge,

764
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:42,640
Let my boss be overrun by a car,
that I can understand.

765
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:46,320
But ruling over the world!
A just society!

766
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:48,240
God's kingdom on earth!

767
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:53,520
These are not just wishes,
this is ideology, action, concepts.

768
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:58,840
Unconscious compassion
is not ready for realization yet.

769
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:02,840
As a regular
instinctive impulse.

770
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:07,120
There cannot be happiness
at someone else's expense.

771
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:10,120
I can see quite clearly now

772
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:14,840
that you plan to overwhelm
mankind with good deeds.

773
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:20,120
As for me, I'm not a bit worried
about you or myself,

774
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:22,520
and least of all about mankind.

775
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:26,120
Because you're not going
to achieve anything.

776
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:30,840
At best you'll get your Nobel Prize.

777
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:37,320
Or rather you'll get something
absolutely incongruous,

778
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:41,440
something you don't even think about.
Something like this telephone...

779
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:47,440
You dream of one thing,
but you get quite another.

780
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:50,640
Why did you do that?

781
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:08,240
Telephone... electricity...

782
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:14,720
Look, very good sleeping pills.

783
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:18,840
They don't make ones like that any
longer. Why so many of them here?

784
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:24,840
Maybe we'd better be going?

785
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:30,240
It will be dark soon,
difficult to come back.

786
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:40,840
By the way, it's absolutely clear
to me

787
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:45,120
that all this poem reciting
and making detours

788
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:47,720
is just a form of apologizing.

789
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:53,720
I can understand you.
Difficult childhood, bad environment...

790
01:55:55,120 --> 01:56:01,240
But don't have any illusions,
I'm not going to forgive you.

791
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:04,320
Will you please stop it,
do me a favor.

792
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:57,920
Professor, come here, please.

793
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:33,640
Wait a minute.
Don't be in a hurry.

794
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:35,920
I'm in no hurry whatsoever.

795
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:26,720
I know, you're going to get mad.

796
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:31,720
Anyway, I must tell you...

797
01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:42,920
We are now...
on the threshold...

798
01:58:50,440 --> 01:58:55,120
This is the most important moment
in your life.

799
01:58:58,520 --> 01:58:59,920
You must know that...

800
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:06,520
Your innermost wishes
will be made real here.

801
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:13,720
Your most sincere wish!
Born of suffering!

802
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:43,440
No need to say anything.

803
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:48,240
You just have to...

804
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:55,440
concentrate
and try to recall your whole life.

805
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:03,440
When a man thinks of the past,
he becomes kinder.

806
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:05,840
And most important...

807
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:39,640
Most important...

808
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:45,640
You have to believe!

809
02:00:55,320 --> 02:00:56,520
Now you can go.

810
02:01:02,440 --> 02:01:03,640
Who wants to be the first?

811
02:01:09,040 --> 02:01:10,120
Maybe, you?

812
02:01:12,240 --> 02:01:14,920
Me? No, I don't want to.

813
02:01:16,120 --> 02:01:20,320
I understand, it's not easy,
but it will pass.

814
02:01:22,240 --> 02:01:23,320
I doubt...

815
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:26,720
that it will pass.

816
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:31,720
If I begin recalling my life,

817
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:35,240
it's very unlikely I'll get any kinder.

818
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:41,640
Besides, don't you feel
how shameful the whole thing is?

819
02:01:58,840 --> 02:02:03,640
Humiliating yourself,
sniveling, praying?

820
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:06,920
What's so bad in praying?

821
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:10,840
It's just your pride speaking.

822
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:17,440
Calm down, you're not ready yet.
It happens quite often.

823
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:21,520
Maybe, you first?

824
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:30,720
Yes, me.

825
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:46,240
We see before us
Professor's new invention!

826
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:51,040
An appliance exploring human souls!
Soulmeter!

827
02:02:51,640 --> 02:02:53,240
It's only a bomb.

828
02:02:54,440 --> 02:02:55,320
What?

829
02:02:57,440 --> 02:02:58,520
You must be kidding.

830
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:04,120
No, it's just a bomb.
Twenty kilotons.

831
02:03:05,720 --> 02:03:06,840
What for?

832
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:20,840
We had it assembled with my friends.

833
02:03:22,840 --> 02:03:26,520
With my former colleagues.

834
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:34,120
This place will never bring any
happiness to anyone.

835
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:42,520
But if this thing gets into the wrong
hands...

836
02:03:45,120 --> 02:03:47,120
Though, I'm not sure any more.

837
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:50,920
We came to the conclusion then...

838
02:03:53,640 --> 02:03:56,120
that we shouldn't destroy the Zone
after all.

839
02:03:57,640 --> 02:04:03,240
Even if it's some miracle,
it's still part of nature,

840
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:06,240
and therefore, a hope in a sense.

841
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:12,440
They had hidden that bomb,
and I've found it.

842
02:04:12,720 --> 02:04:15,120
The old building, bunker four.

843
02:04:20,440 --> 02:04:23,720
I guess there must be a principle...

844
02:04:25,320 --> 02:04:27,720
Never do anything
that can't be undone.

845
02:04:28,120 --> 02:04:30,120
I understand everything, I'm not some
maniac.

846
02:04:34,440 --> 02:04:39,520
But as long as this plague lies
in the open, accessible to any scum,

847
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:43,720
I can get no peace, no sleep.

848
02:04:51,640 --> 02:04:54,920
Or maybe, my innermost
won't let me do it?

849
02:05:00,520 --> 02:05:03,240
Poor man, some problem
he's invented for himself.

850
02:05:26,120 --> 02:05:27,120
Give it to me!

851
02:05:41,720 --> 02:05:42,720
Give it to me!

852
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:49,840
You're a civilized man, aren't you?

853
02:05:57,120 --> 02:06:00,240
- Why? What's the matter with you?
- You, lousy hypocrite...

854
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:06,320
Why?
What have I done... to you?

855
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:11,440
He wants to destroy your hope!

856
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:36,840
That's all people have got left
on this earth!

857
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:42,240
It's the only place
they can come to,

858
02:06:42,640 --> 02:06:44,440
if there’s no hope left for them.

859
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:48,520
You yourself have come here!

860
02:06:49,640 --> 02:06:52,440
Why destroy hope then?

861
02:06:52,640 --> 02:06:54,640
Shut up!

862
02:06:57,040 --> 02:06:59,120
I can see through you!

863
02:07:00,440 --> 02:07:02,440
You don't give a damn about people!

864
02:07:03,640 --> 02:07:09,040
You just make money,
using our... anguish!

865
02:07:09,240 --> 02:07:10,640
It's not even the money.

866
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:13,840
You're enjoying yourself here.
You're like God Almighty here.

867
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:18,120
You, a hypocritical louse, decide
who is to live and who is to die.

868
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:20,920
He deliberates!

869
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:26,520
Now I see why you stalkers
never enter the room yourselves.

870
02:07:26,840 --> 02:07:31,840
You revel in all that power,
that mystery, your authority!

871
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:33,640
What else is there to wish for?

872
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:37,120
It's not true!
You... you're mistaken.

873
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:44,120
A stalker must not enter the room.

874
02:07:44,840 --> 02:07:48,640
A stalker must not even enter
the Zone with an ulterior motive.

875
02:07:49,320 --> 02:07:50,920
Remember Porcupine?

876
02:07:53,920 --> 02:07:55,840
Yes, you're right, I'm a louse.

877
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:59,040
I haven't done any good in this world,
and I can't do any.

878
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:03,520
I couldn't give anything
even to my wife.

879
02:08:04,840 --> 02:08:09,240
I can't have any friends either.
But don't take mine from me!

880
02:08:09,440 --> 02:08:12,920
They'd already taken everything from
me back there, behind the barbed wire.

881
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:21,720
So all that's mine is here.
You understand? Here! In the Zone!

882
02:08:23,640 --> 02:08:27,840
My happiness, my freedom,
my self-respect, it's all here!

883
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:33,240
I bring here people like me,
desperate and tormented.

884
02:08:33,640 --> 02:08:37,320
People who have nothing else
to hope for.

885
02:08:38,640 --> 02:08:40,640
And I can help them!

886
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:44,320
No one else can help them,
only l, the louse, can!

887
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:49,520
I'm so happy to be able to help them
that I want to cry.

888
02:08:50,840 --> 02:08:52,840
And that's all.
I don't want anything more.

889
02:09:14,640 --> 02:09:16,440
I don't know. Maybe.

890
02:09:17,440 --> 02:09:19,520
Anyway, excuse me, but...

891
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:22,440
You're just a God's fool.

892
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:27,720
You have no idea
what's going on here.

893
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:34,520
Why do you think Porcupine
hanged himself?

894
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:38,120
He came to the Zone
with a mercenary motive.

895
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:41,240
He made his brother die
in the meat mincer because of money.

896
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:44,440
I know.
But why did he hang himself?

897
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:49,040
Why didn't he come here again,
not for money, but for his brother?

898
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:51,840
In way of repenting.

899
02:09:52,440 --> 02:09:56,520
He wanted to... I don't know.
He hanged himself a week later.

900
02:09:56,720 --> 02:09:59,320
Because he realized that
not just any wish comes true here,

901
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:02,520
but only your innermost wish.

902
02:10:10,640 --> 02:10:12,840
Not what would you holler
at the top of your voice...

903
02:10:20,840 --> 02:10:23,840
Coming true here is
only what's in line with your nature,

904
02:10:24,040 --> 02:10:26,840
with your essence,
of which you know nothing.

905
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:30,240
But it's there, in you,
directing you all your life.

906
02:10:31,720 --> 02:10:33,920
You didn't understand anything,
Leather Stocking.

907
02:10:34,240 --> 02:10:36,240
It wasn't greed that had done
Porcupine in.

908
02:10:36,440 --> 02:10:39,440
He was crawling in this puddle,
begging to bring his brother back.

909
02:10:40,040 --> 02:10:44,720
But what he got was only money,
and he couldn't get anything else,

910
02:10:45,640 --> 02:10:48,240
because render unto Porcupine
the things that are Porcupine's!

911
02:10:49,120 --> 02:10:53,240
And things like conscience, anguish,
they are just inventions.

912
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:55,920
He realized that and hanged himself.

913
02:11:00,640 --> 02:11:02,520
I'm not going to your room.

914
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:08,640
I have no wish to pour my filth
over somebody's head.

915
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:10,720
Even yours.

916
02:11:11,720 --> 02:11:13,840
And then to put my neck into
the noose, like Porcupine.

917
02:11:15,320 --> 02:11:19,920
I'd rather drink myself to death
in my mansion, in peace and quiet.

918
02:11:22,440 --> 02:11:27,320
You don't understand anything
about human beings, Chingachgook,

919
02:11:28,040 --> 02:11:30,320
if you take to the Zone
people like me.

920
02:11:38,120 --> 02:11:39,320
And something else...

921
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:45,040
Why do you think that this miracle
really exists?

922
02:11:46,640 --> 02:11:51,120
Who told you that wishes
actually come true here?

923
02:11:53,440 --> 02:11:57,840
Have you seen a single man
who's been made happy here?

924
02:11:59,040 --> 02:12:00,520
Was it Porcupine?

925
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:10,040
As a matter of fact,
who told you about the Zone,

926
02:12:10,240 --> 02:12:13,240
about Porcupine, about that room?

927
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:15,720
He did.

928
02:13:18,640 --> 02:13:20,720
Then it makes no sense to me at all.

929
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:24,320
What's the use coming here?

930
02:14:44,720 --> 02:14:45,840
It's so quiet...

931
02:14:47,720 --> 02:14:48,720
Can you feel it?

932
02:14:54,320 --> 02:14:57,320
What the heck... Why not chuck it all,

933
02:14:59,040 --> 02:15:03,240
take my wife, Monkey,
and move over here.

934
02:15:06,920 --> 02:15:07,840
For good.

935
02:15:10,640 --> 02:15:14,840
There's no one here.
No one can hurt them here.

936
02:19:19,720 --> 02:19:20,920
So you're back.

937
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:28,840
Where did you get this?

938
02:19:30,440 --> 02:19:33,840
He got attached to me.
I couldn't leave him there.

939
02:19:51,240 --> 02:19:55,840
Well, shall we go?
Monkey is waiting.

940
02:20:00,120 --> 02:20:01,120
Are you coming?

941
02:20:15,240 --> 02:20:17,320
Does any one of you need a dog?

942
02:20:20,320 --> 02:20:22,640
I've got five of them at home.

943
02:20:32,440 --> 02:20:34,920
So you love dogs, don't you?

944
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:36,520
What?

945
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:38,240
That's very good.

946
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:46,120
All right, let's go.

947
02:23:41,440 --> 02:23:43,320
You can't even imagine
how tired I am!

948
02:23:45,320 --> 02:23:46,920
God only knows!

949
02:23:49,040 --> 02:23:53,240
Calling themselves intellectuals,
those writers and scientists!

950
02:23:53,440 --> 02:23:54,320
Don't get so excited.

951
02:23:55,440 --> 02:23:57,120
They don't believe in anything!

952
02:23:58,040 --> 02:24:04,720
They've got the organ with which one
believes atrophied for lack of use.

953
02:24:06,640 --> 02:24:09,840
Stop it. Come on.
Go to bed. Don't lie here...

954
02:24:10,440 --> 02:24:14,520
It's too damp here for you...
You shouldn't lie here.

955
02:24:18,320 --> 02:24:19,040
Take it off.

956
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:29,920
Oh God, what people...

957
02:25:30,320 --> 02:25:33,520
Calm down, it's not their fault.

958
02:25:34,440 --> 02:25:36,640
You ought to pity them,
not to be angry with them.

959
02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:39,520
Haven't you seen them? They've
got empty eyes.

960
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:54,520
The only thing
they can think about

961
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:57,720
is how to sell themselves
not too cheap!

962
02:25:58,040 --> 02:26:00,520
How to get as much as possible
for their every emotional movement!

963
02:26:03,640 --> 02:26:07,840
They know they were "born for
a purpose", "called upon"!

964
02:26:10,640 --> 02:26:12,240
After all, they live "only once"!

965
02:26:14,520 --> 02:26:17,240
Can people like that
believe in anything?

966
02:26:18,640 --> 02:26:21,120
Stop it, calm down.

967
02:26:22,440 --> 02:26:25,920
Try to sleep, will you?
Go to sleep.

968
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:35,320
And nobody believes.
Not only those two. Nobody!

969
02:26:36,440 --> 02:26:38,040
Who am I going to take there?

970
02:26:42,240 --> 02:26:43,240
Oh, God...

971
02:26:44,520 --> 02:26:45,840
And what's most awful...

972
02:26:48,440 --> 02:26:50,320
is that no one needs it.

973
02:26:50,520 --> 02:26:54,440
No one needs that room.
And all my efforts are just in vain.

974
02:26:55,440 --> 02:26:58,440
Why do you say that?
Stop it.

975
02:27:04,840 --> 02:27:06,840
I'm not going there with anybody
again.

976
02:27:08,920 --> 02:27:13,320
Do you want me to go with you?

977
02:27:14,840 --> 02:27:15,840
Where?

978
02:27:16,520 --> 02:27:18,920
You think I've got nothing
to ask for?

979
02:27:23,640 --> 02:27:24,440
No...

980
02:27:28,520 --> 02:27:29,840
You can't go there.

981
02:27:30,120 --> 02:27:31,120
Why not?

982
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:34,920
No, no.

983
02:27:40,040 --> 02:27:43,640
What if it wouldn't work
with you, either?

984
02:28:18,440 --> 02:28:21,320
You know, my mother was against it.

985
02:28:23,440 --> 02:28:27,640
You've probably noticed already
that he's not of this world.

986
02:28:30,720 --> 02:28:32,720
All our neighborhood laughed at him.

987
02:28:33,120 --> 02:28:35,640
He was such a bungler,
he looked so pitiful.

988
02:28:38,120 --> 02:28:41,520
My mother used to say:
"He's a stalker,

989
02:28:41,720 --> 02:28:44,040
he's doomed,
he's an eternal prisoner!

990
02:28:44,240 --> 02:28:47,520
Don't you know what kind of
children the stalkers have?"

991
02:28:47,720 --> 02:28:50,320
And l... I didn't even argue with her.

992
02:28:53,240 --> 02:28:56,720
I knew it all myself,
that he was doomed,

993
02:28:56,920 --> 02:29:00,920
that he was an eternal prisoner,
and about the children.

994
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:06,240
Only what could I do?

995
02:29:06,440 --> 02:29:09,440
I was sure
I would be happy with him.

996
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:13,920
Of course, I knew I'd have a lot of
sorrow, too.

997
02:29:15,440 --> 02:29:20,040
But it's better to have
a bitter happiness than...

998
02:29:21,720 --> 02:29:23,440
a gray, dull life.

999
02:29:28,440 --> 02:29:31,640
Perhaps,
I thought it all up later.

1000
02:29:40,920 --> 02:29:44,840
But then he approached me and said:
"Come with me."

1001
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:49,640
And I did,
and never regretted it.

1002
02:29:53,440 --> 02:29:54,520
Never.

1003
02:29:57,440 --> 02:30:00,040
We had a lot of sorrow,

1004
02:30:00,440 --> 02:30:02,440
a lot of fear, and a lot of shame.

1005
02:30:02,640 --> 02:30:06,120
But I never regretted it,
and I never envied anyone.

1006
02:30:08,440 --> 02:30:13,520
It's just our fate, our life,
that's how we are.

1007
02:30:19,240 --> 02:30:22,840
And if we haven't had our misfortunes,
we wouldn't have been better off.

1008
02:30:24,440 --> 02:30:25,720
It would have been worse.

1009
02:30:28,440 --> 02:30:33,240
Because in that case, there wouldn't
have been any happiness.

1010
02:30:35,640 --> 02:30:37,320
And there wouldn't have been
any hope.

1011
02:31:26,840 --> 02:31:29,840
I love your eyes, my darling friend,

1012
02:31:30,440 --> 02:31:33,520
Their play, so passionate and
brightening,

1013
02:31:34,920 --> 02:31:37,840
When a sudden stare up you send,

1014
02:31:38,640 --> 02:31:41,240
And like a heaven-blown lightning,

1015
02:31:41,840 --> 02:31:45,040
It'd take in all from end to end.

1016
02:31:45,840 --> 02:31:48,840
But there's more that I admire:

1017
02:31:49,440 --> 02:31:52,240
Your eyes when they're downcast

1018
02:31:52,640 --> 02:31:55,840
In bursts of love-inspired fire,

1019
02:31:56,240 --> 02:31:59,320
And through the eyelash goes fast

1020
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:06,520
A somber, dull call of desire...

1021
02:34:47,640 --> 02:34:54,440
The End
