1
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,359
The next stop is Broad Street.

2
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,727
Broad Street will be next.

3
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:00,667
Upstairs. This way.

4
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,611
He didn't come up this way?
Anything?

5
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,413
He's not up here.
Go back down.

6
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,350
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

7
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,671
Go ahead and park
around the corner.

8
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,666
Visitors.

9
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,067
Do you mind
if I fetch my teeth?

10
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,036
Colonel, would you
turn around, please?

11
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,140
Sit down on the bed.

12
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,642
Let's go.

13
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,986
Uh, they're in the...
The teeth are in the... on the sink.

14
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,855
Look at me. We are agents

15
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,990
from the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

16
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,091
Look at me!

17
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,893
I'm talking to you.

18
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,728
We've received information

19
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,031
concerning your
involvement in espionage.

20
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,066
You can either cooperate
with us right now,

21
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,701
or you'll be under arrest.

22
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,669
Do you understand, Colonel?

23
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,637
No, not really.

24
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,974
Why do you
keep calling me "Colonel"?

25
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,776
You need
to get dressed.

26
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,844
We have to search
your apartment.

27
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:42,949
Would you mind if I, uh,
cleaned my palette?

28
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,785
The paints,
it'll get ruined otherwise.

29
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,153
It's just behind you there.

30
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,123
I have a cloth myself.

31
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,224
Thank you.

32
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,994
All right, start searching the place.
Thank you.

33
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,162
All right,
search the mattress,

34
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,430
the bed, the floorboards,
his chair.

35
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,732
Would you put that
in the ashtray on the windowsill there?

36
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,300
Take a good look
at that desk.

37
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,639
Let's see the desk.

38
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:14,981
Wouldn't want
to get this ruined.

39
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,697
Don't say "my guy."

40
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,734
He's not "my guy."

41
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,803
Yes, he's "your guy."
Who are we talking about?

42
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:41,774
We're talking about a guy
who was insured by my client.

43
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,776
So, don't make him "my guy."

44
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,312
Okay, fine.

45
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:49,915
My point is, the guy
insured by your client,

46
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,718
he doesn't deny that
any of these things happened.

47
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,287
"These... These things"?

48
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,957
Yes,
these five things.

49
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,759
Wait, hold it,
hold it, hold it.

50
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,060
Not five things.

51
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,062
One thing.

52
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,196
Clearly,
it's five things.

53
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,965
Well, I'm sorry,
it's not clear to me.

54
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,801
Five things?
Explain it to me.

55
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,069
It's self-evident.

56
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,971
Okay, then tell me
what happened.

57
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,341
Tell me the story in a way
that makes sense for five things.

58
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,777
Fine, absolutely.
Your guy is...

59
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,145
Not my guy.
Insured by my client.

60
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,813
The guy insured
by your client

61
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,314
is driving down
State Highway 19

62
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,950
when he loses control
of his car and hits my five guys,

63
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,086
the five guys who hired me
to represent them

64
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,554
because you're not
honoring your claim.

65
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:32,291
You mean my client is not
honoring the claim, the insurance company?

66
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,960
Mr. Donovan,
we're all clear on who's who, here.

67
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,797
Except my client
honors every claim.

68
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,931
They do, Mr. Bates.

69
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,299
Every single
legitimate claim,

70
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:41,967
up to the limit
of their liability,

71
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,136
which is $100,000
per accident,

72
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,305
in the case of
this man's policy.

73
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:47,506
And this is one claim.

74
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,243
According to your description,
"He hit my five guys."

75
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:54,280
The guy insured by my client
had one accident.

76
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,548
One, one, one.

77
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:59,118
Losing control of the car and
hitting five motorcyclists.

78
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,353
From their point of view,
five things happened.

79
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:05,224
Well, look, Bob.
May I? Bob?

80
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,327
"Jim."

81
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,130
If I go bowling and I throw
a strike, one thing happened.

82
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,231
Ten things didn't happen.

83
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,300
Jim, my guys
aren't bowling pins,

84
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,035
as much as your guy
may have treated them as such.

85
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,369
If... Let me finish.
Let me finish.

86
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,206
If your house
is insured for $100,000

87
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,241
and a tornado
carries it away,

88
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:23,943
it carried away one house.

89
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,411
It didn't pick up
every stick of furniture

90
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:28,114
and destroy it
in a separate incident.

91
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,883
If that is
what you're saying,

92
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,153
well, then there is never
any limit to our liability

93
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:37,189
and that is the end
of the insurance business.

94
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,391
And then, Bob,
nobody is safe.

95
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,299
Watters, Cowan and Donovan.
How may I direct your call?

96
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,968
Morning, Mr. Donovan.

97
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,302
Good morning, Alison.

98
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,271
I moved your 9:00 a.m.
with Prudential, sir.

99
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,405
Why did you do that?

100
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,007
I asked her to.

101
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,276
Is everything
all right, Tom?

102
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,979
Why don't you leave your stuff with Alison.
Come on inside.

103
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,414
Something pretty important
has come up.

104
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,183
Somebody's here to see us.

105
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,051
Natalie's getting
your coffee.

106
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,854
Nescafe, cream, two lumps,
right?

107
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,156
That's right. Thanks.

108
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:13,425
Lynn!
Jim!

109
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,327
Nice to see you again.
How's the family?

110
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,163
Great, good. Thanks.
How's Annie?

111
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,431
Homicidal. We had
the in-laws for the holiday.

112
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,705
Well, if she acts on it,
she'll have good representation.

113
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,036
Now, what's up?

114
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,378
Okay, here's the thing.

115
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,915
The Soviet spy they caught,
we want you to defend him.

116
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,216
Here's the indictment.

117
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,420
Wow.

118
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,157
I'm not sure
I wanna pick that up.

119
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,226
The accused
doesn't know any lawyers.

120
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,195
The federal court
tossed it into our lap.

121
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,431
The Bar Committee took a vote.

122
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,266
You're the unanimous choice.

123
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,901
It was important to us...

124
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,236
It's important
to our country, Jim,

125
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,205
that this man is seen
as getting a fair shake.

126
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,240
American justice
will be on trial.

127
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,175
Well, of course,
when you put it that way,

128
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,177
it's an honor to be asked.

129
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,112
But, Lynn,
I'm an insurance lawyer.

130
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,081
I haven't done
criminal work in years.

131
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,116
It's like riding a bike,
isn't it?

132
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,219
You distinguished yourself
at Nuremberg.

133
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,954
I was on
the prosecution team.

134
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,222
Not the point.

135
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,615
You're no stranger
to criminal law.

136
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,292
Jim, look at the situation.

137
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,361
The man is publicly reviled.

138
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,395
And I will be, too.

139
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,264
Yes, in more
ignorant quarters.

140
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,132
But that's exactly why
this has to be done,

141
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,235
and capably done.

142
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,237
It can't look like
our justice system

143
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,430
tosses people
on the ash heap.

144
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,246
Suppose I did,
what's the evidence look like?

145
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,015
Pretty overwhelming.

146
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,517
Great. Great.

147
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,187
Everyone will hate me
but at least I'll lose.

148
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,424
Well, what do
you think, Tom?

149
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,127
The firm will suffer.
I have work here.

150
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,196
I think
it's a patriotic duty.

151
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,198
It's an important mission.

152
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,433
I told Lynn,
the firm can't say no,

153
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,535
and you'd have a tough time
saying no, too.

154
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:08,007
I think you have to defend
the son of a bitch.

155
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,042
So, you're doing it?

156
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,410
Doing what?

157
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,446
Defending Abel,
the Soviet spy.

158
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,781
I may. I have to speak to...

159
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,450
Wait, how do you know?
Did they post it on the bulletin board?

160
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,552
No, I... I was
talking to Richard Earl...

161
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,488
Look, if I do this,
I'm going to need your help.

162
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,293
Can you work tonight?

163
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,401
Well, I have
a dinner date, sir.

164
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,302
It's Tuesday, right?
Yeah, no, I'm free, completely free.

165
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:37,436
Thank you, sir.

166
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,309
But it's also an honor.

167
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,444
And the Bar Association
asked me

168
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,246
because they want
to show that even a spy

169
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,048
gets a capable advocate.

170
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,216
Well, maybe it's the kind of honor
we could do without.

171
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,650
Hey, honey,
what are you doing home?

172
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,053
I got stood up.

173
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,557
Well, that's despicable.

174
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,159
Who is this knot-head?

175
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,360
I'd rather not say.

176
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,529
Well, sit down.
We just started.

177
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,730
People are scared.

178
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,598
They're building
bomb shelters to protect themselves

179
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,034
from people like this man.

180
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,235
I go to the store,

181
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,572
people are buying
canned food and potassium tablets.

182
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,408
It's all about this man
and what he represents.

183
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,510
He's a threat to all of us.
A traitor.

184
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,346
Who's a traitor?
The Rosenbergs were traitors.

185
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,280
Who were they?

186
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,382
They gave atomic secrets
to the Russians.

187
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,384
They were Americans.
They betrayed their country.

188
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,486
You can't accuse Abel
of being a traitor.

189
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,054
He's not an American.

190
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,456
Oh, listen to yourself.

191
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,124
You're defending him already.

192
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,192
You're rehearsing it on me.

193
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,227
You said you were
just thinking about taking it.

194
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,130
I am just thinking about it,
just very hard.

195
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,100
Everyone deserves a defense.
Every person matters.

196
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,434
Jim, what do we deserve?

197
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,403
Do you know how
people will look at us?

198
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,605
The family of a man
trying to free a traitor?

199
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,540
He's not a traitor, Mary.
Yes, yes.

200
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,109
Roger, get that! He's not a traitor...

201
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,377
Why do I have to do
all the work?

202
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,212
Oh! You wait till we say grace.
I'm hungry!

203
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,613
He's about the most unpopular
man in this country,

204
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,248
and you're trying
to take second place!

205
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,683
Yeah, and I'm third.

206
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,685
Carol, you just dated the wrong guy.
I wanna eat.

207
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,253
Mary, don't make
this an argument

208
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:02,287
when we're not having
an argument.

209
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,589
You're against him,
I'm for him?

210
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,425
No, I'm not for him.
I'm not for the Russians spying on us.

211
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,428
I'm for his right to have a defense
in a court of law,

212
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,463
which is why they call it
a court of law.

213
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,365
I didn't mean
to interrupt dinner.

214
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,600
A court of law...
Hey, Doug.

215
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:19,304
Oh, no, not at all.
Hello, Doug. Jim was just flailing.

216
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,573
I'm not flailing.
Go ahead, Doug, you can join us for dinner.

217
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,409
We're having
meatloaf tonight.

218
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:28,213
So, you came over
to help Jim think about

219
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,448
whether he's
taking the case?

220
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,351
Oh, we're taking it!
It's exciting, isn't it?

221
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,194
Lord, we thank thee
for thy blessings

222
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,629
we are about to receive.

223
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,198
Thy bounty through Christ,
our Lord. Amen.

224
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,741
Good morning, sir.
My name is Jim Donovan.

225
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,743
These are my credentials.

226
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,212
I am a partner in
Watters, Cowan and Donovan.

227
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,615
I was admitted to
the New York Bar in 1941.

228
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:11,523
You have been charged
with three counts and 19 overt acts.

229
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,226
Conspiracy to transmit
United States defense

230
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,761
and atomic secrets
to the Soviet Union,

231
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,529
conspiracy to
gather secrets,

232
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,698
and failing to register
as a foreign agent.

233
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,739
Do many foreign
agents register?

234
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,247
If you don't mind
my asking, sir,

235
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:39,485
since your arrest,
where have you been?

236
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,456
I couldn't say for certain.

237
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:47,825
You don't know?

238
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,396
They drove me to an airport

239
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,565
and put me on a plane,
took me off the plane.

240
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,236
Somewhere hot.

241
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,471
It's hot here.

242
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,441
Hotter, very humid.

243
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,409
They put me in a room.

244
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,646
Were you beaten?

245
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,681
No.

246
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,683
I was talked to.

247
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,785
Offers were made.

248
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,887
What do you mean?

249
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,423
Offers of employment,
to work for your government.

250
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,362
I was told if I cooperated,

251
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:25,564
no further charges
would be made against me.

252
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,400
And I would be given money.

253
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:30,836
Hmm.

254
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,437
And you declined?

255
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,308
As you see.

256
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,710
Well, of course
I can't endorse that.

257
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,679
I feel duty-bound
to urge you

258
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,814
to cooperate with
the U.S. government.

259
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,249
Well, I said no.

260
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:47,486
Perhaps you could relay
to your friends at the CIA that I meant it.

261
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,521
No, no, no.

262
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,490
I... I don't work
for the agency.

263
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,460
I don't work
for the government.

264
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:58,730
I am here to offer my services
as your legal counsel.

265
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,600
If you accept them
as such,

266
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,369
I work for you.

267
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,838
If I accept you?

268
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,447
Are you good at what you do?

269
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,484
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm pretty good.

270
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,591
Have you represented
many accused spies?

271
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,295
No, not yet.

272
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,399
This will be a first
for the both of us.

273
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,338
Yes.

274
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,408
All right.

275
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:44,876
"All right"?
You accept?

276
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,847
Yes, all right.

277
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,383
Good, okay.

278
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,551
Let's start here.

279
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,719
If you are firm
in your resolve

280
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,354
not to cooperate
with the U.S. government...

281
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,488
I am.

282
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:57,923
Yeah.

283
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,791
Then do not talk
to anybody else about your case,

284
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,526
inside of government or out.

285
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,663
Except to me,
to the extent that you trust me.

286
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,698
I have a mandate to serve you.
Nobody else does.

287
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,500
Quite frankly,
everybody else has an interest

288
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,973
in sending you
to the electric chair.

289
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:11,669
All right.

290
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,642
You don't seem alarmed.

291
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,582
Would it help?

292
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:37,929
I... I would like
materials to draw with.

293
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,431
That's not possible.

294
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,401
A pencil, a piece of paper.

295
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,635
Cigarettes.

296
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,606
Please?

297
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,816
Mr. Donovan,
you have men like me

298
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,419
doing the same
for your country.

299
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,889
If they were caught,

300
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,825
I'm sure that you would
wish them to be treated well.

301
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,764
What's your name?

302
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,433
Francis Gary Powers.

303
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,470
Rank, service?

304
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,706
First Lieutenant,
United States Air Force.

305
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,476
Do you have any association

306
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,511
with the Soviet Union,
Lieutenant Powers?

307
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:27,746
Kidding?

308
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:28,947
Just answer the questions,
Lieutenant.

309
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,550
Yes, no,
or as simply as you can.

310
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,752
Do you have any association
with the Soviet Union?

311
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,487
Hell, no.

312
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,490
Do you know
why you're here?

313
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,691
Mmm-mmm.

314
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,794
Is that a no?

315
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:45,030
Yes. I mean...

316
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,932
No, it's just "no."

317
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:49,501
Yes, I have absolutely
no idea why I'm here.

318
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,702
Eyes front, Lieutenant.

319
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:51,870
Yes, sir.

320
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:10,856
How'd you do in there, Gary?

321
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,594
Pretty good.
Think I got my name right.

322
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:18,563
You probably
outscored Shinn, then.

323
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,466
Who's winning?

324
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,734
Uh, that would be me.

325
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,703
Oh. Well, deal me in.

326
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,938
So, these are
all mine, then.

327
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,807
I told you boys
not to play with him.

328
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,669
Okay, drivers,
here's the deal.

329
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:01,006
You've been selected
for a mission

330
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,574
which you are
not to discuss

331
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,876
with anyone
outside of this room.

332
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,645
No one.

333
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:08,713
I don't care who you trust.

334
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,715
Wife, mother, sweetheart.

335
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,717
The good Lord
when you pray at night.

336
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,686
You don't tell
any of them anything

337
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,521
of what
I'm about to tell you.

338
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,760
Each of you drivers has
met certain qualifications.

339
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,830
High level
security clearance.

340
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,631
Exceptional pilot ratings

341
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,633
in excess of
the required hours flight time

342
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,602
in a single-seat aircraft.

343
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,605
We are engaged in a war.

344
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,874
This war does not, for the moment,
involve men-at-arms.

345
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,776
It involves information.

346
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,011
You will be
collecting information.

347
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,881
You will be gathering
intelligence about the enemy.

348
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:46,551
The intelligence you gather
could give us the upper hand

349
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:49,120
in a full thermonuclear exchange
with the Soviet Union.

350
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,591
Or it could prevent one.

351
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:56,127
For public purposes,

352
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,929
as far as your wife or mother

353
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,931
or sweetheart
or the good Lord above,

354
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,967
your mission does not exist.

355
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,836
If it does not exist,
you do not exist.

356
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,973
You cannot be shot down.
You cannot be captured.

357
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,047
You work for the CIA now.

358
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,797
So, Jim, I heard your guy is
speaking with a phony accent.

359
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:35,901
Does he keep that up
all the time?

360
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:38,670
Actually, I'm pretty sure
that's just the way he talks.

361
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,805
He's got the Russian name
but a British passport.

362
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,742
Well, I doubt
that that's genuine.

363
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:46,044
So, Jim, where are we?
I see here...

364
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,680
Yes, uh, Judge, you see,

365
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:53,084
I just don't think that three weeks
is going to do it, here.

366
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:55,086
We... We got a massive amount
of evidence, as you know.

367
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,187
You wanna postpone?

368
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,389
Six weeks.

369
00:25:57,422 --> 00:26:00,892
I mean, there's just myself
and my associate, basically.

370
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,127
Jim, is this serious?

371
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,161
Sir?

372
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,999
Is this serious?

373
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,668
Yes. Yes, indeed, it is.

374
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,102
You can see
in the filing...

375
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,972
Jim, this man is a Soviet spy.

376
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,675
Allegedly.
Come on, Counselor!

377
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,744
Your Honor.

378
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,179
Of course, I salute you.

379
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:23,748
We all salute you for
taking on a thankless task.

380
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,650
This man has to have
due process.

381
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:26,952
But let's not kid each other.

382
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,989
He'll receive
a capable defense.

383
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:34,726
And, God willing,
he'll be convicted.

384
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,127
Come on, Counselor.

385
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,696
Let's not play games
with this.

386
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,831
Not in my courtroom.

387
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,866
We have a date

388
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,735
and we're going to trial.

389
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,879
Taxi!

390
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,681
Taxi!

391
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,684
I see your light on!
Son of a bitch.

392
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:03,755
Can't wait to get back
to Manhattan.

393
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:04,990
His light was on, right?

394
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,959
Son of a bitch.

395
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,808
Against their
level of comfort.

396
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:57,909
The statute hasn't changed.

397
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,344
Oh, excuse me, sir.

398
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,046
Pardon me. Sorry. Oh!

399
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,045
Mr. Donovan.

400
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,049
What?

401
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,987
What?

402
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,268
CIA.

403
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:58,302
Yeah.

404
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,371
I just wanted to chat.

405
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,177
How's the case going?

406
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,980
Case is going great.
Couldn't be better.

407
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,081
Mmm-hmm.

408
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:12,117
Has your guy talked?

409
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:19,090
Excuse me.

410
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,860
You met him. Has he talked?
Has he said anything yet?

411
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,964
We're not having
this conversation.

412
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,099
No, of course not.

413
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,301
No, I mean,
we really are not having it.

414
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:34,038
You're asking me to violate
attorney-client privilege.

415
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,340
Oh, come on, Counselor.

416
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:36,341
You know,
I wish people like you

417
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:37,442
would quit saying
"Oh, come on, Counselor."

418
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:39,344
I didn't like it the first
time it happened today.

419
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:41,179
A judge said it to me twice.

420
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:43,214
And the more I hear it,
the more I don't like it.

421
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:49,087
Okay, well, listen,
I understand attorney-client privilege.

422
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,323
I understand
all the legal gamesmanship.

423
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:55,059
And I understand
that's how you make a living.

424
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,962
But I'm talking to you
about something else.

425
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,066
The security
of your country.

426
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,236
And I'm sorry
if the way I put it offends you.

427
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,940
But we need to know
what Abel is telling you.

428
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,042
You understand me, Donovan?

429
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:13,111
We need to know.

430
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,913
Don't go "Boy Scout" on me.

431
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,183
We don't have
a rule book, here.

432
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,486
You're Agent Hoffman, yeah?

433
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,388
Yeah.

434
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:25,490
German extraction.

435
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:26,958
Yeah, so?

436
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,893
My name's Donovan. Irish.

437
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,329
Both sides,
mother and father.

438
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:34,499
I'm Irish, you're German.

439
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:37,368
But what makes us
both Americans?

440
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,470
Just one thing.

441
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,139
One, one, one.

442
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,273
The rule book.

443
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,177
We call it the Constitution

444
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,179
and we agree to the rules,

445
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,981
and that's what
makes us Americans.

446
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,149
It's all that
makes us Americans

447
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,250
so don't tell me
there's no rule book,

448
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,886
and don't nod at me like that,
you son of a bitch.

449
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,432
Do we need to
worry about you?

450
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,903
Not if I'm left alone
to do my job.

451
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,219
From this moment forward

452
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,989
you will not refer to the U-2
as a spy plane

453
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:33,024
or reconnaissance aircraft.

454
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,293
You will refer to it
as "The Article."

455
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:38,463
The Article
has an 80-foot wingspan.

456
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:44,002
It's powered by a single Pratt and Whitney
J57 P-37 engine.

457
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,404
10,000 pounds of thrust

458
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:50,475
and a maximum speed
of 430 miles an hour.

459
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,243
She may not be quick,

460
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:55,179
but at your cruising altitude
of 70,000 feet,

461
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,015
nothing will
come close to you.

462
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,182
70,000?

463
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:01,185
The idea is the enemy doesn't
even know you're there.

464
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:03,087
It looks kind of flimsy.

465
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:10,094
Every extra pound of weight
costs a foot in altitude,

466
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,963
and we need
to accommodate the cameras.

467
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:18,069
That's a 4,500-millimeter
lens, times three.

468
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,405
A pin-sharp
panoramic camera

469
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:25,076
four times as powerful as any aerial
reconnaissance cameras we've ever used.

470
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:28,313
You're gonna be taking
pictures, lots of pictures.

471
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,615
At 70,000 feet,
The Article can photograph

472
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:34,585
2,000 square miles
of territory in one pass.

473
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,354
Now, drivers,

474
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:39,524
give Agent Sumner
your undivided attention.

475
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:43,628
The items you will need
on your mission are over here.

476
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:46,364
B camera,
Revere 8 model 40 magazine,

477
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:49,233
Keystone Capri K-25, silver.

478
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,235
Hollow-handle shaving brush.

479
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:54,405
Complete set of cipher tables
on edible silver foil.

480
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,274
Specialist photographic
equipment.

481
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,179
Yeah, we, uh...
We get the idea. Thank you.

482
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:16,427
Uh, excuse me,
Agent, uh, Bosco. "Blasco."

483
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,296
Sir.

484
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:23,334
There seems to be
a subsection to this list here.

485
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:25,370
Well, most of this stuff
came from his studio,

486
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,563
but the rest is from the
hotel room he was holed up in.

487
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,207
Where we found him.

488
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,643
The hotel room you searched?

489
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,445
Well, yeah.

490
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,547
Can I see the warrant?

491
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,182
The what?

492
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,153
Yeah, explain this to me.
There was a warrant.

493
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,521
There was a warrant.

494
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,623
A civil detention writ
for the arrest of an alien,

495
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:47,525
but there was
no search warrant

496
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:49,360
for suspicion
of criminal activity.

497
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:50,628
So, the search
and the evidence

498
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,397
that is
the fruit of that search,

499
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,532
that's all tainted
and should not be admitted.

500
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:57,301
What protections is he due,
Your Honor? The man is not...

501
00:33:57,335 --> 00:34:00,171
The man is what?
He's Rudolf Ivanovich Abel.

502
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,106
He is a Soviet citizen.

503
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,408
He's not an American.

504
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:07,578
1886,
Yick Wo v. Hopkins.

505
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:10,715
The court held that even aliens,
in that case Chinese immigrants,

506
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:14,118
could not be held to answer for a crime
without due process of law,

507
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,312
including any alien that entered
the country illegally.

508
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:18,189
The Department of Justice

509
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,459
has its first allegiance
to the United States.

510
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,594
I don't see how an alien,
if he's here illegally,

511
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,497
how he suffered
deprivation of rights.

512
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,332
Rights as what?

513
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,201
An American?

514
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:33,371
Rights as what, Counselor?

515
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,206
We're in a battle
for civilization.

516
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,443
This Russian spy came here
to threaten our way of life.

517
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,545
Now, I have a courtroom
of people waiting.

518
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,580
Get out there,
sit beside the Russian.

519
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,749
Let's get this
over and done with.

520
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:47,218
And your motion is denied.

521
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,156
He should take some
insurance out on himself.

522
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:53,758
How did we do?

523
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,226
In there?

524
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:57,628
Uh...

525
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,630
Not too good.

526
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,666
Apparently, you're not
an American citizen.

527
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,634
That's true.

528
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:05,436
And according
to your boss,

529
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,138
you're not
a Soviet citizen either.

530
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,475
Well, the boss
isn't always right

531
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,711
but he's always the boss.

532
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:19,716
Do you never worry?

533
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,687
Would it help?

534
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:30,827
All rise.

535
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:37,435
"I pledge allegiance
to the Flag

536
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,538
"of the United States
of America,

537
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:44,542
"and to the Republic
for which it stands,

538
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:49,447
"one Nation under God,
indivisible,

539
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,749
"with liberty and justice
for all."

540
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,588
First,
you have to know what happens

541
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,657
when an atomic bomb explodes.

542
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,496
There is a bright flash,
brighter than the sun.

543
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,666
It can smash in buildings,
break windows all over town.

544
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:14,739
But if you duck and cover
like Bert,

545
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:16,707
you will be much safer.

546
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,843
There are
two kinds of attack,

547
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:21,312
with warning
and without any warning.

548
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,681
Mmm.

549
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:27,618
What's going on in here?

550
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,520
Okay, Dad,
this is really important.

551
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,589
When the war begins,
the first thing they do

552
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:34,325
is cut off all the water
and all the electricity.

553
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,460
So the first thing we should do
is keep this filled,

554
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:37,828
use the shower in your room,

555
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,364
use the sink downstairs,
the garden hose outside...

556
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,466
Those are good ideas.

557
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,468
But, Roger, I don't see this

558
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,382
as being something
you ever have to worry about.

559
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:49,073
Yeah, but when
you hear the sirens,

560
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:52,310
there may not be enough time
to fill the tub and the sinks.

561
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:54,779
Not gonna be any sirens...

562
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:57,748
What is this?

563
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:58,816
When the bomb comes,

564
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:01,686
the Reds will aim
for the Empire State Building.

565
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,522
But the bomb goes off
at 10,000 feet up.

566
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,490
In Life magazine,
it's called an airburst,

567
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,526
and if the bomb
is 50 megatons,

568
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,729
the blast wave goes
out and out and out

569
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:14,298
and melts everything
from here to here.

570
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:15,566
Including where we live.
Here.

571
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,502
Yeah, right there.

572
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:19,637
But, you know, Roger,

573
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,306
no one is dropping
atomic bombs on us.

574
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,708
But the Russians want to.

575
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,643
You know that Russian guy
you're defending?

576
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:26,744
He's here
to get things ready

577
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:28,579
for the guys
who drop the bombs.

578
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:30,681
No, no, he's not...
Not here for that.

579
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,316
He's not even Russian.

580
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,385
He was born, we think,
in Northern England.

581
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,658
Yeah, but he's
a spy for Russia.

582
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,923
I don't even understand
what you're doing.

583
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:41,392
You're not a Communist,
so why are you defending one?

584
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,394
Well, because it's my job.

585
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,463
It never used to be.

586
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:17,428
In the case of the
United States of America

587
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,664
versus Rudolf Abel,

588
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:22,366
as to the first count
in the indictment,

589
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,468
how do you
find the defendant?

590
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,737
Guilty or not guilty?

591
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:27,771
Guilty.

592
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:30,641
As to the second count?

593
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,877
Guilty.

594
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,979
As to the third count?

595
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,247
Guilty.

596
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,649
Your Honor, I make a motion
to set aside these guilty verdicts

597
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,418
against the weight
of evidence.

598
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:41,952
Denied.

599
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,854
The jury is discharged.

600
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:45,923
Thank you all.

601
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,858
I would like to add that,
if I were one of you,

602
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,794
I would've reached
the same verdict.

603
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,964
Sentencing will be

604
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,435
November 15.

605
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:08,512
The death sentence is not
a foregone conclusion.

606
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:09,547
Don't worry.

607
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,850
I'm not afraid to die,
Mr. Donovan.

608
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,722
Although

609
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,657
it wouldn't be
my first choice.

610
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,996
You left this behind.

611
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:28,666
Oh, thank you.

612
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,903
Oh, thank you very much!

613
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,693
You've never asked me
if the charges were true.

614
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:01,432
If I am indeed a spy.

615
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,069
This is how we do it.

616
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:07,471
The case against you matters.

617
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:08,873
Making them prove it matters.

618
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,808
The fiction is...

619
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,810
Whether you did it or not
doesn't matter.

620
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:15,813
The state has to prove it,
that you're a spy.

621
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,548
So you're not curious?

622
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,550
No, not really.

623
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,086
I always assumed
you were an artist.

624
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:24,054
My wife, she's the artist.

625
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,690
She's a musician

626
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:30,528
in the Children's Orchestra
of Moscow.

627
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:31,896
What instrument?

628
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,798
The harp.

629
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:34,831
Oh.

630
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,568
Then, she's an angel.

631
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:50,614
Standing there like that,
you remind me of a man

632
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,883
who used to come
to our house when I was young.

633
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:57,655
My father used to say,
"Watch this man."

634
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:02,092
So I did,
every time he came.

635
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,095
And never once

636
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,965
did he do
anything remarkable.

637
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,536
And I remind you of him?

638
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:19,777
This one time, I was
about the age of your son.

639
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,913
Our house was overrun
by partisan border guards.

640
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:29,019
Dozens of them.

641
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:31,088
My father was beaten,
my mother was beaten,

642
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:34,525
and this man,
my father's friend, he was beaten.

643
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:38,128
And I watched this man.

644
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,000
Every time they hit him

645
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:46,837
he stood back up again.

646
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,608
So they hit him harder.

647
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:54,945
Still,
he got back to his feet.

648
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,885
I think because of this
they stopped the beating.

649
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:02,620
They let him live.

650
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,863
I remember them saying it.

651
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,773
It sort of means, like, uh,

652
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,577
"standing man."

653
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,214
Standing man.

654
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:45,696
Hello, Jim!
Millie, you're a vision.

655
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,098
Mortie's busy
getting kitted out.

656
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:49,633
But come on in.

657
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:53,804
Scotch, Jim?
Oh, yes, please. Thank you.

658
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,673
Uh, just a drop of water.

659
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:57,942
Your Honor.

660
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:00,844
Hello, Jim!
Just going out.

661
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:02,846
Got a few minutes though.

662
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,849
March of Dimes thing.
Millie is active.

663
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:09,053
Well, thank you
for seeing me.

664
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:13,123
I just wanted to give you
my two cents on the sentencing.

665
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:16,260
And I thought maybe
I should pester you at home

666
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:19,263
as not all of my points
are narrowly legal.

667
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:22,066
Yeah, well,
it's that kind of case.

668
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,134
I hope I wasn't too scratchy
during the trial

669
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:27,004
but it's exactly
what you say.

670
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:28,973
Nothing about this
is narrowly legal.

671
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:31,909
There are bigger issues.

672
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,979
Bigger issues!

673
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:39,083
Thank you, thank you.

674
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,117
Uh...

675
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,887
Sir...

676
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,923
I think it could be
considered

677
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,726
in the best interests
of the United States

678
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:51,695
that Abel remain alive.

679
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:53,998
Why?

680
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:55,766
I'm not saying
I've made up my mind

681
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:56,934
but if he was
gonna cooperate,

682
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,136
work with the government,
he would've done it already.

683
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:00,270
- True, but the issue here...
- You can't...

684
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,006
Excuse me.

685
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,913
You can't say it's in the best interest
of the United States

686
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:13,917
that he spend
the rest of his days in a prison cell.

687
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,020
How is this
the national interest?

688
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:18,188
Not the incarceration
itself, sir.

689
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:22,926
It is possible that,
in the foreseeable future,

690
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,195
an American
of equivalent rank

691
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,965
might be captured
by Soviet Russia.

692
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,234
We might want to have
someone to trade.

693
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:31,935
Wow.

694
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,138
That sounds like
spinning what-ifs.

695
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,073
You could do that
till the cows come home.

696
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:39,043
It's my business, what-ifs.
I'm in insurance.

697
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:41,345
And there's nothing
implausible about this one.

698
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:44,782
It's entirely in the realm
of what could happen.

699
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:48,185
It's the kind of probability that
people buy insurance for.

700
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:52,156
If we send this guy to his death,
we leave ourselves wide open.

701
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,958
No policy
in our back pocket

702
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,794
for the day the storm comes.

703
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,231
Nice speech.

704
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:06,904
Sir, there is also
the humanitarian argument.

705
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:10,007
Should he die for doing the job
they sent him to do?

706
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:13,277
All right, Counselor.

707
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,047
I gotta run.

708
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:22,152
Good seeing you, Jim.

709
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:27,825
I'll walk you out.

710
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:32,295
All rise.

711
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,332
The United States
District Court

712
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:38,035
for the Eastern District
of New York is now in session.

713
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,137
The honorable
Mortimer Byers presiding.

714
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:46,176
Be seated.

715
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,890
The defendant
will please rise.

716
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,173
In the measured judgment
of this court

717
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:17,441
the following sentence,

718
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:19,977
based upon the jury's
verdict of guilty

719
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:22,312
as to each count
of the indictment,

720
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:27,151
is believed to meet the test
which has been stated.

721
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:30,087
Pursuant to the verdict
of guilty as to all counts,

722
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:34,324
the defendant is committed
to the custody

723
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,426
of the Attorney General
of the United States

724
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,964
for imprisonment
in a federal institution

725
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:44,434
to be selected by him
for a period of 30 years.

726
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,938
Marshals, you may take
the defendant into custody.

727
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,072
No... No electrocution?

728
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:50,474
No. No, no.

729
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:52,242
Why aren't we hanging him?

730
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:53,477
In the name of God,
why aren't we hanging him?

731
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,412
Sit down, sir!

732
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:59,149
He's a spy!
He's killing us with his lies!

733
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:00,918
In the name of God,
why aren't we hanging him?

734
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:01,952
That's right!

735
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,255
He's a spy!

736
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:11,361
Mr. Donovan! Mr. Donovan!

737
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:14,364
Just one question.
Just one question, sir.

738
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:23,173
My hat! My hat! My hat!

739
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:26,944
Nobody here has a comment.

740
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:28,512
Mr. and Mrs. Donovan
are not answering questions.

741
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:29,947
How do you feel now that

742
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,148
this national nightmare
is over?

743
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,482
Mr. Donovan, are
you happy with the verdict?

744
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:36,119
We're... We're in
firm ground on, uh, for a case on appeal.

745
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:37,393
Appeal?
Appeal, yes.

746
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:53,403
Jim, you did a great job.

747
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:56,206
You fulfilled your mandate
and then some.

748
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,242
But the man is a spy.

749
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,978
The verdict is correct
and there's no reason to appeal it.

750
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:02,946
There's ample
procedural reason.

751
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,047
We know the search
is tainted.

752
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:05,249
And Fourth Amendment issues

753
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:07,284
will always weigh more heavily
in an appellate forum.

754
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:09,019
We've got a good shot.

755
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:12,022
What the goddamn hell
are you talking about?

756
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:15,259
We were supposed to show
he had a capable defense, which we did.

757
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:17,561
Why are you citing
the goddamn Constitution at me?

758
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:19,296
Tom, if you
look me in the eye

759
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,365
and tell me
we don't have grounds

760
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,399
for an appeal,
I'll drop it right now.

761
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:24,568
I'm not saying that.
You know what I'm saying.

762
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:27,037
Tom is saying there's
a cost to these things.

763
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,572
That's right.

764
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:31,241
A cost to both
your family and your firm.

765
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:09,079
I've missed music.

766
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,448
They checked the radio to make
sure there was no transmitter in it.

767
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:13,350
I'm sure they did.

768
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,387
Shostakovich. Mmm.

769
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:22,092
That's a very great artist,
Shostakovich.

770
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:39,142
Uh, I think

771
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:44,514
our strongest grounds
for reversal

772
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:45,548
are constitutional.

773
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:52,422
Our best chance is if the Supreme Court
agrees to review our case.

774
00:49:58,095 --> 00:49:59,296
Jim...

775
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:07,337
You should be careful.

776
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,311
Careful.

Maybe we'll find

it's very likely.

00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:32,622
You're still
defending this guy?

811
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:33,390
I mean, what are you
fighting for him for?

812
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,492
Okay, knock that off,
Officer.

813
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:36,760
I'll knock off nothing.

814
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:38,428
I was in the third wave
at Omaha Beach.

815
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:39,563
Hey, I did my time
in the service.

816
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,498
I was fighting these guys,
and you're defending them?

817
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:44,234
Why don't you just
do your job as an officer of the law?

818
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,769
Okay, I'm sorry.
Let's go outside. Come on.

819
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:47,337
You know what?
Just forget him.

820
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,638
What am I not getting here?

821
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:52,642
Outside, Officer. I'm sorry.

822
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:55,479
Defending a commie spy. Jeez!

823
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,332
Do you feel
that you deserve this, sir?

824
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:38,755
Should it become necessary

825
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:41,825
to abandon the aircraft
over Soviet territory,

826
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:44,427
then there's a two-and-a-half pound
explosive charge

827
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:46,696
contained within
the fuselage.

828
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,699
Now, first,
you activate the circuits.

829
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:54,638
But to start
the 70-second timer,

830
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,574
you need to flip the switch
marked "Destruct."

831
00:53:00,544 --> 00:53:04,681
It is imperative that these
flights remain a secret

832
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:08,251
and this equipment
does not fall into enemy hands.

833
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:10,420
What about us?

834
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:12,622
I don't know if you're kidding,
Lieutenant Powers.

835
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:14,324
I'm not.

836
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,861
What you know
about the plane

837
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:20,263
is as secret
as the plane itself.

838
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:25,602
If capture
is a foregone conclusion,

839
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:27,671
you go down with your plane.

840
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:30,607
Now, if you think
you can ditch and get away,

841
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,309
if you're close enough
to a border, fine.

842
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:33,577
You know
the ejection protocol.

843
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,748
But if you ditch,

844
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:40,884
you bring the dollar with you.

845
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:43,453
All right,
there's a pin inside.

846
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:48,625
You scratch your skin
anywhere, it's instantaneous.

847
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:51,628
If you think you are
about to be captured,

848
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:52,829
you use it.

849
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,735
Drivers, you understand me?

850
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:02,272
Spend the dollar.

851
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,529
Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the court.

852
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:02,899
The "Cold War" is not
just a phrase, Your Honor.

853
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:05,568
It's not just
a figure of speech.

854
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:07,737
Truly,
a battle is being fought

855
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:11,574
between two competing views
of the world.

856
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:14,844
I contend
that Rudolf Ivanovich Abel,

857
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:16,980
"Colonel Abel,"
as he was called

858
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:19,449
even by the men
who arrested him,

859
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:22,619
is our foe in that battle.

860
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,387
Auxiliary power?

861
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:25,989
Connected and on.

862
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:28,458
Oxygen seat-pack supply?

863
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,926
Supply at 1,800 psi.

864
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,628
Inverter?

865
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:32,796
On, light out.

866
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,999
He was treated
as a combatant in that war

867
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:40,003
until it no longer
suited our government to so treat him.

868
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:42,405
Accordingly,

869
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:45,875
he was not given the protections
we give our own citizens.

870
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:47,644
He was subjected
to treatment that,

871
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:50,447
however appropriate
for a suspected enemy,

872
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,949
was not appropriate
to a suspected criminal.

873
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:54,417
Fuel transfer?

874
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:55,518
Transfer switch off.

875
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:56,653
Destructor?

876
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,821
Destructor safety.

877
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,022
Climb data card.

878
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:00,590
Installed in aircraft.

879
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:16,740
I know this man.

880
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:20,577
If the charge is true, he serves a
foreign power but he serves it faithfully.

881
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:24,547
If he is a soldier in the opposing army,
he is a good soldier.

882
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:27,517
He has not fled the field
of battle to save himself.

883
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,719
He has refused
to serve his captor.

884
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:32,055
He has refused
to betray his cause.

885
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:34,657
He has refused
to take the coward's way out.

886
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:37,527
The coward
must abandon his dignity

887
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,062
before he abandons
the field of battle.

888
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:42,532
That,
Rudolf Abel will never do.

889
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,666
Shouldn't we,

890
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,869
by giving him
the full benefit

891
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,505
of the rights that define
our system of government,

892
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:50,940
show this man who we are?

893
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:53,777
Who we are.

894
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:58,081
Is that not the greatest weapon
we have in this Cold War?

895
00:56:58,114 --> 00:57:01,084
Will we stand by our cause
less resolutely

896
00:57:01,117 --> 00:57:03,052
than he stands by his?

897
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,818
The President announced

898
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:52,789
that a NASA weather plane disappeared
four days ago north of Turkey.

899
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:54,724
And the Space
Administration fears

900
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,993
that its pilot died
in the crash.

901
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:59,862
Radar showed the plane
wandering off course

902
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:03,866
deep into Soviet territory
before contact was lost,

903
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,935
complicating any effort
to recover it

904
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:08,004
or the remains of the pilot.

905
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:10,273
Now to news
out of Washington.

906
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:11,374
In a close vote today,

907
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:14,077
the Supreme Court
affirmed the conviction

908
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,913
of Russian spy
Rudolf Ivanovich Abel,

909
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,881
five votes to four.

910
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:21,150
The case presented
civil liberties issues,

911
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:24,954
according to the Russian's lawyer,
James B. Donovan.

912
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:27,156
When asked how he felt
about today's loss,

913
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:31,060
Mr. Donovan simply said,
"Tired."

914
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:34,230
I'll have more news for you
after this message.

921
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:50,313
I, uh, Mr. Watters had me

922
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:52,248

Yeah, he redrafted and filed that last week

Do you know anyone

932
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:37,827
"Leipzig." Am I getting
hate mail from Germany now?

933
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:38,995
From East Germany.

934
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,006
Is it your wife?

935
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,040
No.

No, no, no, no.

937
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:58,047
She pretends to be

What's the next move

01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:30,113
Francis Gary Powers...

946
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:36,819
On the strength of Article Two
of the U.S.S.R. law

947
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:40,423
on criminal responsibility
for state crimes

948
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:42,959
to 10 years of confinement

949
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:45,361
with the first three years
to be served in prison.

950
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:49,432
The term of the punishment,

951
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:52,335
including
preliminary detention,

952
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:55,037
shall be counted
from May first,

953
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:57,206
nineteen hundred and sixty.

954
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:25,368
Mr. Donovan,
thank you so much for coming.

955
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:27,870
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Dulles.

956
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:29,071
It's an honor, sir.

957
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:34,477
Nescafe, cream, two lumps.

958
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:36,979
Thank you.

959
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:39,182
Okay,
this letter you received.

960
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:41,918
Seems pretty clear that the Soviets
are making an overture here.

961
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,587
They're doing it
through East Germany

962
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,989
because they still don't want
to acknowledge Abel as a Soviet citizen,

963
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:49,158
much less a Soviet spy. So...

964
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,195
Lot of fiction going on.

965
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:54,463
Yes, sir, but to what end?

966
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,933
They got our guy,
our spy pilot.

967
01:03:56,966 --> 01:03:58,167
We've got their guy.

968
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:04,407
Prisoner exchange,
I think that's what they're after.

969
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,076
Which could hardly be
a surprise to you, Counselor.

970
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:10,046
It's an eventuality
that I think you foresaw.

971
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,249
Yes, I sure did,
and I'm so rarely right.

972
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:16,385
Well, congratulations.
Red letter day.

973
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:20,489
Now, we have our man
over there. Powers.

974
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:24,460
Good man, but with
a head full of classified information.

975
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:27,129
Abel has a head
full of classified information, too,

976
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:29,131
but he hasn't
given us a lick.

977
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:30,967
And, sir, take it from me,
he won't.

978
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,369
Yes, we know that,
but the Russians don't.

979
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:36,272
They want their man back
before he cracks.

980
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:39,242
And we want Powers back
for the same reasons.

981
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:44,947
I think
you are saying, sir,

982
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:47,416
that there might be
a happy ending for everyone.

983
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:50,419
Yes, if we, um,
indulge their fiction.

984
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:01,030
We want you
to negotiate the swap

985
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:02,231
because you're
a private citizen,

986
01:05:02,265 --> 01:05:04,433
so it's not
governments talking.

987
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:07,169
They don't acknowledge
Abel as a Soviet citizen,

988
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:10,973
and we don't acknowledge East Germany
as a sovereign country.

989
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:12,275
We haven't
recognized East Berlin

990
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:15,044
since it was annexed
by the Soviets in '45.

991
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:18,281
So I act as a negotiator,
representing...

992
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:20,149
You're not
representing anybody.

993
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:21,222
Not a government official.

994
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,419
You have no
official standing.

995
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:25,454
So, some fiction
on our side as well.

996
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:26,789
Correct.

997
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:30,192
Which means, of course,
you can't rely on any acknowledgment

998
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:32,995
or help if things go south.

999
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:35,097
CIA can't be responsible.

1000
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:36,432
We can't be embarrassed.

1001
01:05:39,368 --> 01:05:41,504
Where do they want this
negotiation to take place?

1002
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:43,105
There.

1003
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:44,340
"There"?

1004
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:45,541
East Berlin.

1005
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:50,313
Well, isn't East Berlin
getting rather...

1006
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:52,548
Oh, yes, the place
is getting complicated.

1007
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:55,584
Yeah, complicated.

1008
01:05:58,554 --> 01:06:02,058
The Soviet side has been setting up
checkpoints for the past few months

1009
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:04,393
to try to stop people
hemorrhaging to the Western sectors,

1010
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:06,262
and it hasn't worked.

1011
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:08,097
We have intelligence
to suggest

1012
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,266
that they may go
one step further

1013
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:12,401
and wall off
the entire Eastern sector.

1014
01:06:18,274 --> 01:06:20,509
Okay, that's it
in a nutshell.

1015
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:23,212
The decision
is entirely yours.

1016
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:26,315
You need time
to kick it around.

1017
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:34,523
No.

1018
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:35,658
No, I don't.

1019
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:38,594
Well, fine. Fine.

1020
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:41,197
Best that this all
remains confidential.

1021
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:46,302
Let's not discuss any of this with, uh,
Mary or with anyone else.

1022
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,471
Share the correspondence
only with us.

1023
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:50,339
Let us know what they want to do
and when.

1024
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:53,309
I've got no client,
no wife, no country.

1025
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:56,412
Don't know what I'm doing
or when or who for.

1026
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:58,180
You're doing it
for your country,

1027
01:06:58,214 --> 01:07:00,216
but your country
doesn't know that yet.

1028
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:03,352
What about my client,
the other person in this equation? My guy?

1029
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:05,254
Your guy?
You mean the Russian?

1030
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:07,156
He's not your guy anymore,
Counselor.

1031
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:10,226
Your guy is
Francis Gary Powers now.

1032
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:13,129
What do I tell
Rudolf Abel?

1033
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:14,530
Tell him not to drop dead.

1034
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:08,577
Professor?

1035
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:15,484
Professor?

1036
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:18,454
Papa went to university.

1037
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,656
You shouldn't be here,
Frederic.

1038
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:22,558
They're having
classes today?

1039
01:09:22,591 --> 01:09:24,827
He went to see.
That's where he goes.

1040
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:26,428
What are you doing here?

1041
01:09:26,462 --> 01:09:28,464
I came to get you
and your father.

1042
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,499
You have to come with me.
You might not get out tomorrow.

1043
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:31,734
Just... Just leave?

1044
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:34,203
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, leave.
Right now.

1045
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:07,736
Go back. Go back.

1046
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:10,306
I'll be okay, I'm American.
Go back.

1047
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:12,575
Go back to your father's.
We'll find another way. Go.

1048
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:19,415
Hey!

1049
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:21,383
So, hi.

1050
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:26,488
Papers, please.

1051
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:28,624
Ich bin Student
Frederic Pryor.

1052
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:30,826
Yes,
Student.

1053
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:44,340
My name's Frederic Pryor.
I'm an economics student.

1054
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:50,512
See?
It's my dissertation. My thesis.

1055
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:54,083
You see? Look, look.

1056
01:10:54,116 --> 01:10:57,720
Look "The foreign trade system
of the European Communist nations." Huh?

1057
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:04,660
It was a lot of work.

1058
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:14,536
No, that's my only copy.

1059
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:17,573
No!

1060
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,377
Tell me something.

1061
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:23,479
It came up
at the last minute.

1062
01:11:23,512 --> 01:11:25,814
They have offices
in London.

1063
01:11:25,848 --> 01:11:28,817
These clients.
Not my idea.

1064
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:31,487
Scotland, this
fishing expedition.

1065
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,722
What kind of
fishing trip, Jim?

1066
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:36,492
Salmon fishing.

1067
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:38,565
Just tell me that you're
not gonna be in any danger,

1068
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:39,928
that this is
just a routine business trip,

1069
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:41,664
and I won't worry.

1070
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:43,666
I need my passport.

1071
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:50,472
Just give me something
to hold on to.

1072
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:51,907
I don't even care
if it's the truth.

1073
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:55,611
I'm doing this for us.

1074
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:21,003
Mr. Michener, here,
is your Berlin escort.

1075
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:23,839
He's an attache
with the U.S. embassy.

1076
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:26,475
- So, it's gotten goddamn complicated.
- Uh-huh.

1077
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:27,876
As you know,
the last letter from Mrs. Abel,

1078
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:30,012
whoever she is, talks about
a lawyer in East Berlin,

1079
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:32,514
Mr. Vogel, whoever he is,
representing her interests, she says.

1080
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:33,916
Yeah, Vogel says

1081
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:35,851
he's gone to the Russian
embassy in East Berlin

1082
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:38,520
and they may be ready
to trade Abel for Powers.

1083
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:40,456
But no one knows who's who,

1084
01:12:40,489 --> 01:12:41,724
but essentially they're all Russian,
right?

1085
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:44,560
Well, Soviet.
Well, we think so.

1086
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:46,762
What do you mean?
Could we turn up the heat in here?

1087
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,999
There's a wrinkle.

1088
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:53,469
They might try
to throw you a curveball.

1089
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:56,472
Try and get you to accept
another prisoner other than Powers.

1090
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:57,840
Another American?

1091
01:12:57,873 --> 01:13:01,009
The, uh, East German Stasi
picked up an American student.

1092
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:02,244
Frederic Pryor.

1093
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:04,847
Uh, the kid they found on the wrong
side of the Wall.

1094
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,648
He's a grad student
out of Yale.

1095
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:08,717
- Came over here to study economics.
- Mmm-hmm.

1096
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:12,588
So, they're making noises
about trying this kid for espionage.

1097
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:15,057
Grave offense, capital crime.
Well.

1098
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:19,828
Vogel got in touch with us,
said he represents Pryor.

1099
01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:24,800
Wait a minute. Vogel represents Mrs. Abel
and this... This kid?

1100
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:26,502
Yeah, he's busy.

1101
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:28,704
Well, so,
what is he?

1102
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:31,073
Vogel, is he, uh,
East German or is he Russian?

1103
01:13:31,106 --> 01:13:33,776
Well, try to figure it out
when you meet him.

1104
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:36,078
At Russian embassy,
East Berlin, noon tomorrow.

1105
01:13:36,111 --> 01:13:38,814
Hoffman will show you
how to get there.

1106
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:40,916
Wait, show me how to get there?
I'm gonna have an escort.

1107
01:13:40,949 --> 01:13:42,785
Right?

1108
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:44,920
Well, that was the plan
but like I said, there's a wrinkle.

1109
01:13:44,953 --> 01:13:47,689
I won't be taking you.
Decision's been made.

1110
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:50,492
No U.S. government personnel are to
cross the border until further notice.

1111
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:51,827
How come?
It's too dangerous.

1112
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,695
Yeah, the East Germans
grabbed this kid.

1113
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:57,666
There's a degree of impunity
that we had not anticipated.

1114
01:13:57,699 --> 01:14:00,669
The point is that the East German agenda
and the Russian agenda

1115
01:14:00,702 --> 01:14:02,104
may not be
the same thing.

1116
01:14:02,137 --> 01:14:04,006
Try and figure it out
and act accordingly.

1117
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:05,841
And try to make a deal.
Powers for Abel.

1118
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:08,777
Well, what about this
college kid, Pryor?

1119
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:11,613
Mmm-mmm.
Don't fall for that.

1120
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:12,714
We can get him out
another time.

1121
01:14:12,748 --> 01:14:13,949
Powers is the whole
ball game.

1122
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:38,707
Where's your room?

1123
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:40,868
I'll be staying
at the Hilton.

1124
01:14:43,111 --> 01:14:44,111
It's not far.

1125
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:48,750
This is a number here
in West Berlin.

1126
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:50,144
Memorize it and
give it back to me.

1127
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:53,021
No, no. I...
I mean, now.

1128
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:57,759
The Soviets keep cutting
the international lines

1129
01:14:57,793 --> 01:15:00,028
but local calls
are okay.

1130
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:01,897
Someone will pick up
day and night.

1131
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:14,076
Now, this docket attached to your passport
will serve as your ticket

1132
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:16,011
into and out of
the Eastern Soviet sector.

1133
01:15:18,113 --> 01:15:19,993
The meeting with Vogel
is set for noon tomorrow.

1134
01:15:26,755 --> 01:15:28,657
There are only a few routes
left to the East.

1135
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,893
You take the S-Bahn, the station we showed
you on the way in.

1136
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:33,195
You're gonna get off
at the Friedrichstrasse station here

1137
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:36,131
and walk to the Soviet embassy
on Unter den Linden here.

1138
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:38,800
Look at the map now.
You shouldn't take it with you.

1139
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:40,936
You're looking at a map,
you're an American, you're a spy.

1140
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:42,971
You could
well be detained.

1141
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:45,073
Just avoid interacting
with people generally.

1142
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:48,043
You don't...
You don't belong, so don't stick out.

1143
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:50,178
Food is scarce over there
and things have started to fall apart.

1144
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,413
There are gangs,

1145
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:54,716
and rule of law is less firmly
established over there.

1146
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,752
And definitely stay away
from the Wall.

1147
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:57,953
On their side,
there's a line

1148
01:15:57,986 --> 01:15:59,021
cleared of buildings
along the Wall.

1149
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:00,756
They call it
the "Death Line."

1150
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:02,691
Cross it and
you'll be shot.

1151
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:05,060
Is there any outcome here
where I'm not either detained or shot?

1152
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:07,696
Don't worry too much
about what Michener said.

1153
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:09,765
No, I'm worried about
what you're saying.

1154
01:16:09,798 --> 01:16:11,800
This kid, Pryor,

1155
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:13,235
that the East Germans have,
how old is he?

1156
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:15,671
Twenty-five. Why?

1157
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:16,872
Same age as Dougie.

1158
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:20,709
Who?

1159
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:22,210
Eh, an associate of mine.

1160
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,814
Frederic Pryor.

1161
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:04,146
Okay, okay, okay.

1162
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,095
Danke.

1163
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:56,024
So, we apologize
if this offends.

1164
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:03,131
Uh...
Coat?

1165
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:23,385
Okay.

1166
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:20,008
Do you understand English?
Yes, sir.

1167
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:22,143
I'm James Donovan.
I'm here to meet a Mr. Vogel.

1168
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:24,279
Mr. Vogel.
He doesn't work here.

1169
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:26,232
I'm just supposed to meet him.
That's all I know.

1170
01:21:49,604 --> 01:21:51,239
Mr. Donovan!

1171
01:21:52,107 --> 01:21:53,441
So we finally meet you.

1172
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:57,245
I'm Helen Abel.

1173
01:21:57,279 --> 01:21:58,580
How is our husband?
Oh. He's fine.

1174
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:00,081
How is my Rudolf?

1175
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:02,050
As good as
can be expected.

1176
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:04,586
And we will
get him back, yes?

1177
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:07,055
This is our daughter.
How do you do?

1178
01:22:07,455 --> 01:22:08,455
Lydia.

1179
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:10,292
Are you Mr. Vogel?

1180
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:12,560
No, no, no!

1181
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:14,329
I'm not Vogel.

1182
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:15,530
I'm cousin Drews.

1183
01:22:17,465 --> 01:22:19,334
This is Rudolf's
beloved cousin Drews.

1184
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:21,569
Yes, cousin Drews.
I am cousin Drews.

1185
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,305
Cousin Drews, yes.

1186
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:24,372
I'm Helen Abel.

1187
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:29,577
When will you see him?

1188
01:22:31,346 --> 01:22:33,348
When will your government
release him?

1189
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:35,350
I'm a little,
uh, lost here.

1190
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:37,252
I'm supposed to meet
a Mr. Vogel.

1191
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:39,387
Oh, Mr. Vogel
is our lawyer.

1192
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:43,358
We were supposed to negotiate,
uh, the exchange.

1193
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:46,161
To bring Rudolf here?
Yes, yes, to bring him here.

1194
01:22:46,194 --> 01:22:49,030
But it doesn't happen unilaterally,
do you understand?

1195
01:22:49,064 --> 01:22:50,565
It has to be
an exchange.

1196
01:22:54,202 --> 01:22:55,370
Not here?

1197
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:03,511
Shh.

1198
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:07,382
Shh. Shh.

1199
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:17,292
Mr. Donovan?

1200
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:18,460
Mr. Vogel.

1201
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:20,395
No, no, no.
Goodness.

1202
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:22,530
My name is Schischkin.
Ivan Schischkin.

1203
01:23:22,564 --> 01:23:24,632
I'm the second secretary
of the Soviet embassy.

1204
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:29,170
It wouldn't be appropriate
for Mr. Vogel to join us.

1205
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:31,373
He is a German national.

1206
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:33,608
So you aren't here to...

1207
01:23:33,641 --> 01:23:37,212
To facilitate this meeting.

1208
01:23:37,245 --> 01:23:40,315
Uh, perhaps Mrs. Abel

1209
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:42,517
would like to compose
herself privately?

1210
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:45,520
And let Mr. Donovan
and myself to talk?

1211
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:48,623
Thank you.

1212
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:01,236
So, I'm confused.
Yes.

1213
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:02,704
Uh, I don't care
who I talk to

1214
01:24:02,737 --> 01:24:06,207
if it's about
an exchange of personnel.

1215
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:08,209
Are you the person
to talk to?

1216
01:24:08,243 --> 01:24:11,179
Yes, yes, yes, of course.
Uh, we should talk.

1217
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:13,448
Please, have a seat,
Mr. Donovan.

1218
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:17,352
Uh, how did you arrive
to the Eastern sector?

1219
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:18,453
The train.
The S-Bahn.

1220
01:24:18,486 --> 01:24:20,255
Ah, and you were alone?

1221
01:24:20,288 --> 01:24:21,723
Yeah.

1222
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:25,126
And you are
credentialed?

1223
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,128
Now, you must know
about me, sir.

1224
01:24:27,162 --> 01:24:28,663
I'm a private citizen.

1225
01:24:28,696 --> 01:24:30,665
I'm a lawyer in Brooklyn
in the United States,

1226
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:33,334
and I've taken time
out of my busy schedule

1227
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:36,137
to help my client,
Rudolf Abel.

1228
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:40,208
I'm authorized to arrange
an exchange of Abel

1229
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:42,677
for Francis Gary Powers.

1230
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:45,580
This is a full
pardon of Abel

1231
01:24:45,613 --> 01:24:47,933
that will be signed
when the exchange actually takes place.

1232
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,618
This is the only
reason I'm here.

1233
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:53,421
I hope and expect to make
this arrangement quickly.

1234
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:56,524
Abel for Francis
Gary Powers

1235
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,195
and Frederic Pryor.

1236
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:04,466
Mmm, we don't have Pryor.

1237
01:25:04,499 --> 01:25:06,468
No? You don't?

1238
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:11,439
I've heard of Pryor,
but he's held

1239
01:25:11,473 --> 01:25:14,609
by the German
Democratic Republic,

1240
01:25:14,642 --> 01:25:17,479
not by the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.

1241
01:25:18,413 --> 01:25:21,382
Well, I'll tell you
the first problem.

1242
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:24,419
The names of your countries
are too long.

1243
01:25:24,452 --> 01:25:27,522
Yes, yes.

1244
01:25:28,623 --> 01:25:30,592
If we release Powers,

1245
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:32,594
it is only to
promote a goodwill

1246
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:33,761
between our countries.

1247
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:38,166
So, it cannot be
an exchange.

1248
01:25:41,402 --> 01:25:42,604
Perhaps...

1249
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:45,507
Perhaps you could
release Abel

1250
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:47,475
as a token of goodwill
to our friends in Germany,

1251
01:25:47,509 --> 01:25:50,378
and then,
some months later,

1252
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:52,814
we would release Powers.

1253
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:55,283
There is an idea.
No. That just won't work for us at all.

1254
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:57,619
See, we need this to be
an exchange.

1255
01:25:57,652 --> 01:25:59,420
You can call it
what you want,

1256
01:25:59,454 --> 01:26:01,289
but an exchange
it must be.

1257
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:04,459
We can have Abel here
within 48 hours.

1258
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:07,662
We need Powers
at the same time we give you Abel.

1259
01:26:09,864 --> 01:26:12,634
Hmm. This is...

1260
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:16,571
Can we call this
the "impatient plan"?

1261
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:18,439
Well, you can call it
whatever you want.

1262
01:26:20,608 --> 01:26:23,444
I can relay your
impatient plan to Moscow,

1263
01:26:23,478 --> 01:26:24,345
see what they say...

1264
01:26:24,379 --> 01:26:27,715
But they will wonder
why so impatient.

1265
01:26:29,317 --> 01:26:30,718
Because I have a cold.

1266
01:26:30,752 --> 01:26:32,672
And I don't live in Berlin
and I want to go home.

1267
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:34,722
They will think,

1268
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:37,592
"Well, the Americans
must have gotten

1269
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:40,562
"all the information
that Abel had to give.

1270
01:26:40,595 --> 01:26:44,399
"And now they're impatient
to trade him,

1271
01:26:44,432 --> 01:26:47,468
"hoping to get in return
this man, Powers,

1272
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:49,604
"that, perhaps,
has not yet given up

1273
01:26:49,637 --> 01:26:51,639
"all the information
that he has to give."

1274
01:26:53,508 --> 01:26:55,643
This is not
an equitable trade, sir.

1275
01:26:56,911 --> 01:26:58,546
But what you're saying is,

1276
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:00,582
if Powers has given up
everything he knows,

1277
01:27:00,615 --> 01:27:02,850
then Moscow would trade?

1278
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:04,452
Why wouldn't they?

1279
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:08,656
As for Abel, if he dies
in an American prison,

1280
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:11,359
the next Russian operative
who gets caught

1281
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:13,428
might think twice about
keeping his mouth shut.

1282
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:18,800
And you never know.
Abel might want to see the sky again

1283
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:21,869
and decide to trade Russian
secrets for small American favors.

1284
01:27:25,707 --> 01:27:27,775
How can we know this?

1285
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:31,479
We little men,
we just do our jobs.

1286
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:33,848
Like Lieutenant Powers.
He's just a pilot.

1287
01:27:36,684 --> 01:27:40,521
He was making photographs
from 70,000 feet

1288
01:27:40,555 --> 01:27:41,715
when he was shot
from the sky.

1289
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:44,759
People in my country
consider this

1290
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:46,628
an act of war.

1291
01:27:48,963 --> 01:27:51,733
We have to get off this
merry-go-round, sir.

1292
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:53,534
The next mistake
our countries make

1293
01:27:53,568 --> 01:27:55,336
could be the last one.

1294
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:58,806
We need to have
the conversation

1295
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,541
our governments can't.

1296
01:28:05,847 --> 01:28:08,516
I will ask Moscow.

1297
01:28:08,549 --> 01:28:10,518
Who knows
what they will say.

1298
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:13,788
There are a lot of people,
Mr. Donovan,

1299
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:17,925
who doesn't want this
exchange to ever take place.

1300
01:28:20,862 --> 01:28:24,399
Can you come back tomorrow
to discuss their answer?

1301
01:28:24,432 --> 01:28:25,433
Powers for Abel.

1302
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:26,934
And Frederic Pryor.

1303
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:28,469
As I said,

1304
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:30,672
Pryor is in the hands
of the organs of

1305
01:28:30,705 --> 01:28:32,907
State Security of the German
Democratic Republic.

1306
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:35,510
I'm confident you can
make arrangements.

1307
01:28:35,543 --> 01:28:37,845
I am merely a secretary

1308
01:28:37,879 --> 01:28:39,580
in the embassy
of foreign power.

1309
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:40,948
Okay, okay.

1310
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:44,585
You have to see Mr. Vogel.
I'll give you his address.

1311
01:28:44,619 --> 01:28:46,554
There actually is
a Mr. Vogel?

1312
01:28:46,587 --> 01:28:48,856
Why would you
imagine otherwise?

1313
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:50,792
Uh, it's a short cab ride.

1314
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:54,829
And please, Mr. Donovan,

1315
01:28:54,862 --> 01:28:56,698
wear an overcoat
in this weather.

1316
01:28:58,499 --> 01:28:59,701
I had mine
stolen from me.

1317
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:02,704
What do you expect?

1318
01:29:02,737 --> 01:29:04,572
It was from
Saks Fifth Avenue.

1319
01:29:05,907 --> 01:29:06,907
Wasn't it?

1320
01:29:15,650 --> 01:29:16,984
Mr. Donovan.

1321
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:18,453
Mr. Vogel.

1322
01:29:18,486 --> 01:29:20,455
Please come in.

1323
01:29:20,488 --> 01:29:21,589
Danke.

1324
01:29:24,959 --> 01:29:26,728
Sorry about the embassy.

1325
01:29:28,796 --> 01:29:30,732
But the Soviets decided
not to host me.

1326
01:29:32,533 --> 01:29:34,435
Very irritating.

1327
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:36,771
I am still trying
to grasp each party's...

1328
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:39,507
Status?

1329
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:42,643
Yes. And interest
in the proceedings.

1330
01:29:42,677 --> 01:29:43,745
Oh.

1331
01:29:43,778 --> 01:29:45,713
It's a new world.

1332
01:29:45,747 --> 01:29:47,782
All very disorienting,
isn't it?

1333
01:29:58,092 --> 01:29:59,827
Let me tell you
what I have to offer.

1334
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:04,532
I'm a good friend...

1335
01:30:04,565 --> 01:30:06,601
"Friend."
No, he's older.

1336
01:30:06,634 --> 01:30:08,536
"Protege"?

1337
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:11,038
Of the attorney general
of the German Democratic Republic.

1338
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:12,473
Sit down, please.

1339
01:30:15,676 --> 01:30:17,545
This unfortunate,

1340
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:19,781
Frederic Pryor,

1341
01:30:19,814 --> 01:30:22,717
he was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

1342
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:25,820
But every accident,
properly viewed,

1343
01:30:25,853 --> 01:30:27,955
is an opportunity,
isn't it, Mr. Donovan?

1344
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:30,958
Well...
Your country refuses to recognize

1345
01:30:30,992 --> 01:30:33,661
the German
Democratic Republic.

1346
01:30:33,694 --> 01:30:35,696
They prefer to
make up stories

1347
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:37,330
that the GDR doesn't
exist, for instance.

1348
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:41,736
Sorry.

1349
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:44,105
As a means of forcing your
government's recognition

1350
01:30:44,138 --> 01:30:46,674
of this real place, sir,

1351
01:30:46,707 --> 01:30:48,576
in which you
find yourself,

1352
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:50,077
the GDR,

1353
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:52,580
the attorney general is
happy to negotiate with you

1354
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:54,849
as a representative
of your government

1355
01:30:54,882 --> 01:30:56,117
for Mr. Pryor's return.

1356
01:30:56,150 --> 01:30:57,718
Mr. Vogel,
I'm not here

1357
01:30:57,752 --> 01:30:59,787
as a representative
of my government.

1358
01:31:02,857 --> 01:31:03,857
All right.

1359
01:31:06,861 --> 01:31:09,030
I think that's childish,
Mr. Donovan.

1360
01:31:09,063 --> 01:31:11,699
Well, I... I have
no official status.

1361
01:31:11,732 --> 01:31:13,100
Fine.

1362
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:15,937
You do not represent the USA,
I do not represent the GDR.

1363
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:18,105
My client is Lydia Abel,
Rudolf's wife.

1364
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:19,740
And I have also...

1365
01:31:19,774 --> 01:31:21,843
Lydia is the daughter.
Helen is the wife.

1366
01:31:27,782 --> 01:31:28,816
Well...

1367
01:31:30,685 --> 01:31:32,086
I am prepared to offer

1368
01:31:32,119 --> 01:31:34,989
Frederic Pryor's exchange
for Rudolf Abel's.

1369
01:31:36,724 --> 01:31:38,025
Then let's be clear.

1370
01:31:38,059 --> 01:31:40,161
We will produce
Rudolf Abel.

1371
01:31:40,194 --> 01:31:43,564
You will produce,
at the same time, the student, Pryor.

1372
01:31:44,098 --> 01:31:45,600
At the same time?

1373
01:31:45,633 --> 01:31:47,068
Absolutely.

1374
01:31:47,101 --> 01:31:51,672
The exchange on offer
is a Russian at the end of his life

1375
01:31:53,975 --> 01:31:56,744
for an American student
at the start of his.

1376
01:32:03,684 --> 01:32:06,654
Schischkin? He's not
an embassy secretary.

1377
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:09,657
Ivan Schischkin is the KGB's
chief in western Europe.

1378
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:10,992
Well, whatever he is,

1379
01:32:11,025 --> 01:32:13,928
he's relaying our
proposal to Moscow

1380
01:32:15,763 --> 01:32:16,931
and they'll decide.

1381
01:32:16,964 --> 01:32:19,734
Could I borrow a coat?
I lost mine.

1382
01:32:19,767 --> 01:32:21,202
How did you
lose your coat?

1383
01:32:21,235 --> 01:32:23,104
You know, spy stuff.

1384
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:28,709
I'll get you another coat.
Good, because...

1385
01:32:28,743 --> 01:32:30,912
So who is, uh...
Who is this Vogel?

1386
01:32:31,812 --> 01:32:33,614
Him, we don't know.

1387
01:32:33,648 --> 01:32:35,917
He might be what you
said he said he is.

1388
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:37,184
Friend of
the attorney general.

1389
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:40,922
Just some guy the GDR
tapped to handle this.

1390
01:32:40,955 --> 01:32:42,857
Sounds like
the East Germans

1391
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:45,626
are fighting for
a place at our table.

1392
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:48,696
The GDR gets Abel back
for the Russians,

1393
01:32:48,729 --> 01:32:49,897
winning their respect...

1394
01:32:49,931 --> 01:32:52,700
And capturing the headlines
for their cause.

1395
01:32:52,733 --> 01:32:54,969
Which, of course,
puts East Germany on the map.

1396
01:32:55,002 --> 01:32:57,705
But we don't care
about their map.

1397
01:32:57,738 --> 01:32:59,206
Stick with
the Russians.

1398
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,842
Stick with the Russians.
It's Powers for Abel.

1399
01:33:01,876 --> 01:33:05,012
So, does all this mean
this might actually happen?

1400
01:33:05,046 --> 01:33:06,914
Yeah, that's what
you seem to be telling me.

1401
01:33:06,948 --> 01:33:09,984
We'll put Abel on a plane,
he'll be here Friday.

1402
01:33:10,017 --> 01:33:12,019
So, if Schischkin
gets the okay,

1403
01:33:12,053 --> 01:33:14,221
all that's left is the
mechanics of the trade.

1404
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:16,090
How we swap our guy
for their guy.

1405
01:33:16,123 --> 01:33:18,225
Our "guys." Two guys.

1406
01:33:18,259 --> 01:33:20,728
Powers and Pryor.

1407
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:23,698
No, now don't go
bleeding heart on me.

1408
01:33:23,731 --> 01:33:25,933
Powers is the whole
ball game.

1409
01:33:25,967 --> 01:33:27,735
Forget this
Ivy League boy,

1410
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:29,870
who obviously thought
it was a good idea

1411
01:33:29,904 --> 01:33:32,273
to study Soviet
economics in Berlin

1412
01:33:32,306 --> 01:33:34,008
in the middle
of the Cold War.

1413
01:33:35,776 --> 01:33:37,111
Powers is who we need.

1414
01:33:38,145 --> 01:33:39,947
You don't even
like Powers.

1415
01:33:41,215 --> 01:33:43,884
Everybody hates Powers.

1416
01:33:43,918 --> 01:33:48,122
He didn't kill himself and he let the
commies parade him on television.

1417
01:33:48,155 --> 01:33:50,691
He's the most
hated man in America.

1418
01:33:50,725 --> 01:33:53,227
After Rudolf Abel,
maybe.

1419
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:54,929
And me.

1420
01:34:03,938 --> 01:34:05,006
Now wake up!

1421
01:34:14,048 --> 01:34:15,916
I gotta sleep.

1422
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:17,251
I just gotta sleep.

1423
01:34:20,955 --> 01:34:22,123
I told you,
you can sleep

1424
01:34:22,156 --> 01:34:23,991
once we talk
what we need to talk.

1425
01:34:24,025 --> 01:34:26,861
You must focus on me.

1426
01:34:26,894 --> 01:34:29,263
Your government doesn't care about you.
You know that.

1427
01:34:29,296 --> 01:34:30,498
Any of you.

1428
01:34:30,531 --> 01:34:34,201
You know that twelve
U-2 pilots incurred brain damage?

1429
01:34:34,235 --> 01:34:37,805
They're vegetables because of altitude,
insufficient oxygen.

1430
01:34:37,838 --> 01:34:39,807
But they keep you
flying, Gary.

1431
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,909
You and your friends.

1432
01:34:41,942 --> 01:34:45,346
They gave you this.
A scratcher, yes?

1433
01:34:45,379 --> 01:34:48,149
Potassium cyanide.

1434
01:34:48,182 --> 01:34:51,118
Does that look like
they care about you?

1435
01:35:20,214 --> 01:35:23,784
What is the construction
of the destructor unit?

1436
01:35:23,818 --> 01:35:25,853
By what means
is this unit operated?

1437
01:35:25,886 --> 01:35:28,989
With what explosives
is the unit charged,

1438
01:35:29,023 --> 01:35:30,858
and what destruction
is it capable of?

1439
01:35:31,425 --> 01:35:33,394
I don't know.

1440
01:35:33,427 --> 01:35:35,830
The pilots were never shown
any of the equipment.

1441
01:35:35,863 --> 01:35:38,132
How wide far
can the radar

1442
01:35:38,165 --> 01:35:40,067
map an area during
an overflight?

1443
01:35:40,101 --> 01:35:41,102
I don't know,
I don't know!

1444
01:35:41,135 --> 01:35:45,106
Were you making
the overflight on April 9th

1445
01:35:45,139 --> 01:35:47,842
over the industrial area
and MiG bomber base

1446
01:35:47,875 --> 01:35:48,943
at Baranovichi?

1447
01:35:48,976 --> 01:35:50,878
I was not.

1448
01:35:50,911 --> 01:35:52,279
This was my
first overflight.

1449
01:35:52,313 --> 01:35:56,250
I need to know about
engine-out to glide ratio.

1450
01:35:56,283 --> 01:35:59,320
How the plane
gets so high.

1451
01:35:59,353 --> 01:36:04,291
We know it reaches
altitude of 70,000 feet.

1452
01:36:04,325 --> 01:36:06,260
Gary, we know this.

1453
01:36:06,293 --> 01:36:08,896
And I need to know
where the planes have flown.

1454
01:36:08,929 --> 01:36:11,298
Where they
have flown, Gary.

1455
01:36:11,332 --> 01:36:13,000
And we must have
this talk now.

1456
01:36:16,203 --> 01:36:18,139
Now.

1457
01:36:18,172 --> 01:36:20,841
And then you can
sleep a little.

1458
01:36:25,045 --> 01:36:26,847
Sir, wake up.

1459
01:36:28,282 --> 01:36:29,282
Wake up, sir.

1460
01:36:32,153 --> 01:36:34,121
Sir, can you come with me, please?
Yeah.

1461
01:36:34,155 --> 01:36:36,190
We gotta move.
Yeah, of course.

1462
01:36:36,223 --> 01:36:37,458
Can you come with me, please?
Yeah.

1463
01:36:37,491 --> 01:36:39,059
Okay.

1464
01:36:40,127 --> 01:36:41,929
Got your glasses?
Uh-huh.

1465
01:36:41,962 --> 01:36:45,199
What time is it?
It's late, but we need to talk,

1466
01:36:45,232 --> 01:36:46,832
and then we need to
get on a plane, okay?

1467
01:36:48,068 --> 01:36:50,171
Yeah.
Yep. Upsy-daisy!

1468
01:36:50,204 --> 01:36:52,106
Upsy-daisy.
That's right.

1469
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:53,407
There we go.
Keep it moving.

1470
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:54,909
Thank you.

1471
01:36:57,178 --> 01:36:58,879
Other way, other way.

1472
01:36:58,913 --> 01:36:59,947
There we go.

1473
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:01,215
You say a plane?

1474
01:37:01,248 --> 01:37:03,117
This way, please.
Keep moving.

1475
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:06,120
So, I received
a favorable decision

1476
01:37:06,153 --> 01:37:08,222
from Moscow
on your proposal

1477
01:37:08,255 --> 01:37:11,225
that we help our friends in the German
Democratic Republic

1478
01:37:11,492 --> 01:37:13,260
by exchanging

1479
01:37:13,294 --> 01:37:15,262
Mr. Powers
for Mr. Abel.

1480
01:37:17,264 --> 01:37:18,499
That's swell.

1481
01:37:18,532 --> 01:37:23,103
May I suggest the Glienicke Bridge
as a place of a swap?

1482
01:37:23,137 --> 01:37:24,405
Why not Checkpoint
Charlie?

1483
01:37:24,438 --> 01:37:27,107
We're not
looking for publicity.

1484
01:37:27,141 --> 01:37:29,076
The Glienicke Bridge
is very quiet,

1485
01:37:29,109 --> 01:37:30,377
especially early
in the morning.

1486
01:37:30,411 --> 01:37:33,180
Glienicke Bridge.
I'll run that by our side.

1487
01:37:33,214 --> 01:37:34,982
We can have Abel here
on Friday.

1488
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:36,317
So, Saturday morning?

1489
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:38,385
Always impatience, yeah?

1490
01:37:38,419 --> 01:37:40,054
I want to get home
and get into bed.

1491
01:37:40,087 --> 01:37:42,356
So, Saturday morning?

1492
01:37:42,389 --> 01:37:43,991
5:30?

1493
01:37:44,024 --> 01:37:45,526
All right.

1494
01:37:45,559 --> 01:37:47,261
We're done here.

1495
01:37:47,294 --> 01:37:48,529
This is a number,

1496
01:37:48,562 --> 01:37:51,999
in case anything
should come up.

1497
01:37:52,032 --> 01:37:53,133
All right.

1498
01:37:53,167 --> 01:37:55,102
Someone will answer
at any hour.

1499
01:37:56,203 --> 01:37:57,504
I don't expect
to use it.

1500
01:37:59,106 --> 01:38:01,408
Shall we toast
the arrangement?

1501
01:38:01,442 --> 01:38:02,977
Why not?

1502
01:38:04,578 --> 01:38:06,113
Armenian brandy.

1503
01:38:06,146 --> 01:38:07,915
Good bracer for your cold.
Thank you.

1504
01:38:09,083 --> 01:38:10,284
Would you mind...

1505
01:38:10,317 --> 01:38:12,152
This is not part
of our business

1506
01:38:12,186 --> 01:38:14,421
but I'd like to ask you
a couple of questions.

1507
01:38:14,455 --> 01:38:16,156
You do not
have to answer.

1508
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:17,391
I shall answer
what I know.

1509
01:38:18,392 --> 01:38:21,428
I like this guy,
your guy.

1510
01:38:21,462 --> 01:38:24,365
What happens to your guy
when he gets home?

1511
01:38:24,398 --> 01:38:26,400
Well, we have to make
a determination

1512
01:38:26,433 --> 01:38:29,103
whether our guy
is now your guy.

1513
01:38:29,136 --> 01:38:31,005
Now, as I said
to you before,

1514
01:38:31,038 --> 01:38:32,273
he's acted
honorably.

1515
01:38:32,306 --> 01:38:34,041
He's still your guy,
believe me.

1516
01:38:34,074 --> 01:38:37,044
Of course you will
say that if it were true

1517
01:38:37,077 --> 01:38:39,280
and if it were
not true.

1518
01:38:39,313 --> 01:38:41,582
I guess it has
come down to that, huh?

1519
01:38:41,615 --> 01:38:43,317
Well, forgive me
for pushing,

1520
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:46,186
but is he
in any danger

1521
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:48,522
if the determination
is made?

1522
01:38:48,555 --> 01:38:50,991
Well, goodness.

1523
01:38:51,025 --> 01:38:53,594
As things are now,
everyone is in danger.

1524
01:38:53,627 --> 01:38:55,195
Cheers.

1525
01:38:55,229 --> 01:38:56,430
Na zdorovie.

1526
01:39:09,343 --> 01:39:11,278
There will be no exchange
on Glienicke Bridge.

1527
01:39:12,379 --> 01:39:14,315
Excuse me, sir.

1528
01:39:14,348 --> 01:39:16,383
There will be
no exchange.

1529
01:39:17,251 --> 01:39:19,119
Not for Frederic Pryor.

1530
01:39:19,153 --> 01:39:22,256
Mr. Vogel, I thought
yesterday we had agreed.

1531
01:39:22,289 --> 01:39:24,525
We agreed on an exchange,
Abel for Pryor.

1532
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:29,396
Now I learn you are
a rug merchant

1533
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:32,299
selling the same rug
to two customers.

1534
01:39:32,333 --> 01:39:35,202
Abel for Pryor you sell to us.
Yeah.

1535
01:39:35,235 --> 01:39:37,438
And Abel for Powers
you sell to the Soviets.

1536
01:39:37,471 --> 01:39:40,107
I'm not quite sure
what the problem is

1537
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:43,344
if the arrangement satisfies
two parties or three or four.

1538
01:39:43,377 --> 01:39:44,511
What difference
does it make?

1539
01:39:44,545 --> 01:39:46,513
The arrangement does not
satisfy this party.

1540
01:39:51,385 --> 01:39:52,419
Now, Mr. Vogel, please...

1541
01:39:52,453 --> 01:39:55,389
Obviously you do not know
who you are dealing with.

1542
01:39:57,458 --> 01:40:00,094
Here's the interest
of the German Democratic Republic.

1543
01:40:01,395 --> 01:40:02,596
To deal with,

1544
01:40:02,629 --> 01:40:05,499
and to be seen to be dealing
with another sovereign power,

1545
01:40:05,532 --> 01:40:07,167
the United States.

1546
01:40:07,201 --> 01:40:09,269
An equal power.

1547
01:40:09,303 --> 01:40:10,671
Instead you treat us
as stooges

1548
01:40:10,704 --> 01:40:12,673
for the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.

1549
01:40:12,706 --> 01:40:15,109
Can we just call them the Russians?
It'll save time.

1550
01:40:16,577 --> 01:40:18,545
I have an appointment, sir.

1551
01:40:18,579 --> 01:40:20,347
I think it's you
who are wasting time.

1552
01:40:20,381 --> 01:40:22,416
Now, tell me if
I am describing this wrong.

1553
01:40:22,449 --> 01:40:24,184
You have a kid,
a university student,

1554
01:40:24,218 --> 01:40:25,552
someone you know
is not a spy,

1555
01:40:25,586 --> 01:40:27,087
who's no threat to you.

1556
01:40:27,121 --> 01:40:28,555
And in exchange
for this person

1557
01:40:28,589 --> 01:40:30,324
who is worthless to you,

1558
01:40:30,357 --> 01:40:32,526
you play an equal part
in an exchange

1559
01:40:32,559 --> 01:40:34,628
between the Russians
and the Americans.

1560
01:40:34,661 --> 01:40:39,166
And this is one transaction
between us and the two of you.

1561
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:40,634
We're not trying to do
two things here, sir.

1562
01:40:40,667 --> 01:40:42,369
We're just doing one thing.
One, one, one.

1563
01:40:42,403 --> 01:40:47,474
It's hard for me to see how the
Republic of East German Democrats is being slighted.

1564
01:40:47,508 --> 01:40:50,377
You agreed with the Soviets
without consulting me.

1565
01:40:50,411 --> 01:40:52,346
Is this a negotiation
or a conspiracy?

1566
01:40:52,379 --> 01:40:53,280
For it to be
a conspiracy,

1567
01:40:53,313 --> 01:40:54,481
there would have to be
harm to you, sir.

1568
01:40:54,515 --> 01:40:57,451
There's just benefits here.
We're of agreeing interests.

1569
01:40:57,484 --> 01:40:59,420
No, you decide
they agree.

1570
01:41:00,421 --> 01:41:02,156
Where is your
appointment, sir?

1571
01:41:02,189 --> 01:41:03,590
In the West.
Ku'damm.

1572
01:41:03,624 --> 01:41:04,624
Good.

1573
01:41:15,769 --> 01:41:16,937
Look around you.

1574
01:41:16,970 --> 01:41:20,474
How does the Eastern sector
compare with the West? Hmm?

1575
01:41:22,509 --> 01:41:24,478
Our Russian friends
have decided that

1576
01:41:24,511 --> 01:41:26,447
we should not rebuild
our capital city.

1577
01:41:28,715 --> 01:41:32,219
But we live in this ruin
made by our Russian friends.

1578
01:41:32,252 --> 01:41:34,221
Go ahead, make your deal
with these Russians.

1579
01:41:34,254 --> 01:41:35,422
We won't be part of it.

1580
01:41:37,524 --> 01:41:38,725
There is no deal
without Pryor.

1581
01:41:38,759 --> 01:41:39,726
We are not
leaving him here.

1582
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,762
Is this your position
or your government's?

1583
01:41:41,795 --> 01:41:45,566
Sir, I'm here.
I'm talking to you.

1584
01:41:45,599 --> 01:41:47,534
But you are not a representative
of your government.

1585
01:41:47,568 --> 01:41:50,270
You don't know who you are.
Neither do we.

1586
01:41:50,304 --> 01:41:52,606
You should be careful.
This is not Brooklyn, Mr. Donovan.

1587
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:01,682
Look, sir.

1588
01:42:01,715 --> 01:42:03,550
You must know that
in every respect that matters,

1589
01:42:03,584 --> 01:42:05,752
I represent
my government.

1590
01:42:05,786 --> 01:42:07,287
You know who I am.

1591
01:42:08,422 --> 01:42:09,456
Do I?

1592
01:42:15,429 --> 01:42:17,231
Uh-oh.

1593
01:42:31,545 --> 01:42:34,381
Do you have
the proper papers?

1594
01:42:34,414 --> 01:42:37,284
Of course not.
It doesn't matter.

1595
01:42:37,317 --> 01:42:38,485
An American lawyer
like you

1596
01:42:38,519 --> 01:42:40,287
can talk your way
out of anything.

1597
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:41,522
Can't you?

1598
01:43:24,331 --> 01:43:26,266
You go with him.

1599
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:28,802
Why?
It's passport problem.

1600
01:43:28,835 --> 01:43:30,404
What... What problem?
What's the problem?

1601
01:43:30,437 --> 01:43:31,638
You go with him.

1602
01:43:34,541 --> 01:43:35,876
And remember,

1603
01:43:35,909 --> 01:43:37,678
we control the fate
of Frederic Pryor.

1604
01:45:22,549 --> 01:45:23,684
My God!

1605
01:45:59,219 --> 01:46:01,655
Yeah,
I'll start with some coffee, please.

1606
01:46:01,688 --> 01:46:03,857
Then I'll have
the Hilton combo

1607
01:46:03,890 --> 01:46:05,726
and the American
breakfast.

1608
01:46:05,759 --> 01:46:06,860
And coffee.

1609
01:46:06,893 --> 01:46:07,961
Both breakfasts?

1610
01:46:07,994 --> 01:46:09,529
Yeah, yeah.

1611
01:46:09,563 --> 01:46:10,764
One first or...

1612
01:46:10,797 --> 01:46:12,499
Both first, both.
Whenever they're ready.

1613
01:46:12,532 --> 01:46:14,501
And coffee.
Hmm.

1614
01:46:32,085 --> 01:46:33,854
You shouldn't be here.

1615
01:46:33,887 --> 01:46:35,055
Well, sometimes
in Germany,

1616
01:46:35,088 --> 01:46:36,957
you just want a big
American breakfast.

1617
01:46:41,027 --> 01:46:43,063
What happened?
Where were you last night?

1618
01:46:43,096 --> 01:46:46,066
Vogel arranged for me
to spend some time in the East.

1619
01:46:46,099 --> 01:46:47,667
Oh, Jesus.

1620
01:46:47,701 --> 01:46:48,935
Frankly, it's not
that much worse

1621
01:46:48,969 --> 01:46:50,804
than where you have me
here in the West.

1622
01:46:52,873 --> 01:46:56,543
So the Russians are fine
with the exchange,

1623
01:46:56,576 --> 01:46:59,079
but now Vogel is saying
that the East Germans won't do it.

1624
01:46:59,112 --> 01:47:00,112
We're not gonna
get Pryor.

1625
01:47:01,515 --> 01:47:03,517
Great, good.

1626
01:47:03,550 --> 01:47:05,552
So the Soviets are set.
We get Powers.

1627
01:47:05,585 --> 01:47:06,853
We get Powers.

1628
01:47:06,887 --> 01:47:08,889
Well done.

1629
01:47:08,922 --> 01:47:10,957
No, the East Germans
won't do it.

1630
01:47:10,991 --> 01:47:13,093
We won't get Pryor,
and that kid matters.

1631
01:47:13,126 --> 01:47:14,828
Every person matters.

1632
01:47:14,861 --> 01:47:17,898
Sure, that's why you tried.
That's why you tried.

1633
01:47:17,931 --> 01:47:19,966
Abel's on his way,
so we're all set for tomorrow morning.

1634
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,569
Wait a minute.
Makes things simple. Makes things simple.

1635
01:47:22,602 --> 01:47:24,871
We are not
getting the kid.

1636
01:47:24,905 --> 01:47:27,040
Yeah, I understand.
We're set.

1637
01:47:27,073 --> 01:47:28,873
We can ignore the message
we got this morning.

1638
01:47:30,677 --> 01:47:31,912
What message?

1639
01:47:31,945 --> 01:47:33,079
From the East Germans.

1640
01:47:33,113 --> 01:47:35,048
They called the number
I gave you.

1641
01:47:35,081 --> 01:47:37,584
They said they wanted
to speak to you today.

1642
01:47:37,617 --> 01:47:39,586
Vogel called?
No, um...

1643
01:47:39,619 --> 01:47:41,955
Office of, uh,
Harald Ott,

1644
01:47:41,988 --> 01:47:43,557
East German
attorney general.

1645
01:47:43,590 --> 01:47:45,058
Wanting what?
What does he want?

1646
01:47:45,091 --> 01:47:46,193
Well, to talk to you.

1647
01:47:46,226 --> 01:47:49,129
But it's okay,
I can't ask you to go back there.

1648
01:47:49,162 --> 01:47:51,765
And listen, you seem to be
persona non grata to some elements,

1649
01:47:51,798 --> 01:47:53,099
so we won't
push our luck.

1650
01:47:53,133 --> 01:47:55,135
So he wants to see me.

1651
01:47:55,168 --> 01:47:57,103
What time?

1652
01:47:57,137 --> 01:48:00,073
Oh, no, no. Now, listen.

1653
01:48:00,106 --> 01:48:02,142
You don't need to go.
In fact, you shouldn't go.

1654
01:48:02,175 --> 01:48:04,611
In fact, you can't go.

1655
01:48:04,644 --> 01:48:06,980
We're set with the Soviets.
We don't want to screw it up.

1656
01:48:07,013 --> 01:48:08,949
I'm not gonna screw it up.
You're not going!

1657
01:48:08,982 --> 01:48:10,550
Don't be a pain in the ass.

1658
01:48:10,584 --> 01:48:11,952
Oh, I ordered.

1659
01:48:11,985 --> 01:48:14,054
Enjoy your big
American breakfast.

1660
01:48:23,797 --> 01:48:25,732
I thought it should
be negotiated

1661
01:48:25,765 --> 01:48:27,968
at the highest level
as a courtesy to you.

1662
01:48:28,001 --> 01:48:29,803
I thank you, sir.

1663
01:48:32,038 --> 01:48:34,908
I don't know how things
became so confused.

1664
01:48:34,941 --> 01:48:37,744
Well, I guess sometimes
they just do.

1665
01:48:42,215 --> 01:48:43,817
For sake of clarity,

1666
01:48:43,850 --> 01:48:46,186
I say we are fully
prepared to exchange

1667
01:48:46,219 --> 01:48:50,924
the so-called student, Pryor,
for Rudolf Abel.

1668
01:48:50,957 --> 01:48:53,793
I understand from Mr. Vogel
that Pryor is very important to you.

1669
01:48:53,827 --> 01:48:55,195
Yes, but...

1670
01:48:55,228 --> 01:48:57,797
Ah, we'll do a memorandum
to that effect.

1671
01:48:59,165 --> 01:49:01,101
Oh, a memorandum.

1672
01:49:01,134 --> 01:49:04,604
Certainly, we commit
to a bi-lateral exchange.

1673
01:49:06,139 --> 01:49:10,677
Yes, yes, sure. I'm not sure
what that means but...

1674
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:15,081
My country also insists
on Francis Gary Powers.

1675
01:49:15,115 --> 01:49:16,182
No!

1676
01:49:21,254 --> 01:49:24,925
This is how things
became so confused.

1677
01:49:24,958 --> 01:49:27,694
Powers. What use
is he, sir?

1678
01:49:27,727 --> 01:49:29,629
You want him back for
punitive reasons?

1679
01:49:29,663 --> 01:49:30,864
What's done is done.

1680
01:49:30,897 --> 01:49:32,198
He has divulged
what he will divulge,

1681
01:49:32,232 --> 01:49:35,035
as no doubt
Abel has also.

1682
01:49:35,068 --> 01:49:39,839
We are offering instead
someone who you insist is innocent.

1683
01:49:39,873 --> 01:49:41,174
And this is right.

1684
01:49:41,207 --> 01:49:42,842
This is who
you should retrieve.

1685
01:49:43,276 --> 01:49:44,911
The future.

1686
01:49:44,945 --> 01:49:46,305
Look to the future.

1687
01:49:49,883 --> 01:49:50,951
Ott.

1688
01:49:53,787 --> 01:49:55,789
Ott.

1689
01:50:04,164 --> 01:50:06,166
I'm sorry. If you could
give me a moment, sir.

1690
01:50:26,152 --> 01:50:28,288
I'm very sorry, sir.
The attorney general regrets

1691
01:50:28,321 --> 01:50:30,991
that he had to leave
on urgent business.

1692
01:50:31,024 --> 01:50:34,260
He left?
Yes. Many apologies.

1693
01:50:34,294 --> 01:50:36,696
I've been waiting
for over an hour.

1694
01:50:36,730 --> 01:50:38,064
Very sorry, sir.

1695
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:41,801
Young man.

1696
01:50:43,937 --> 01:50:45,038
Come here.

1697
01:50:46,806 --> 01:50:48,241
It's all right.
Come here.

1698
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:56,016
Uh...
Take a seat.

1699
01:50:58,084 --> 01:51:00,053
Oh, come on, come on.
Sit down.

1700
01:51:04,224 --> 01:51:05,959
Do you like
your job here?

1701
01:51:06,826 --> 01:51:08,194
It's a very
good job, sir.

1702
01:51:08,228 --> 01:51:10,330
It must be.
Must be interesting.

1703
01:51:10,363 --> 01:51:11,798
Oh, yes, sir.

1704
01:51:11,831 --> 01:51:13,933
And important, too.

1705
01:51:13,967 --> 01:51:16,936
And your English is...
Is good.

1706
01:51:16,970 --> 01:51:18,972
Yes, I hesitate to say
it's excellent.

1707
01:51:19,005 --> 01:51:19,873
But it's excellent,
sir.

1708
01:51:19,906 --> 01:51:21,941
Good, good.
Good.

1709
01:51:21,975 --> 01:51:24,878
See, I just lost my
negotiating partner,

1710
01:51:24,911 --> 01:51:26,946
and I need
somebody to talk to,

1711
01:51:26,980 --> 01:51:28,915
and you seem like
a reasonable young man.

1712
01:51:30,216 --> 01:51:31,851
Can I talk to you?

1713
01:51:33,186 --> 01:51:34,186
Uh...

1714
01:51:35,021 --> 01:51:36,256
It's all right.

1715
01:51:36,289 --> 01:51:38,058
It's all right. I just...

1716
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:42,228
I just need you to give
a message to your boss.

1717
01:51:44,798 --> 01:51:46,358
But it has to be
very, very, very clear.

1718
01:51:47,834 --> 01:51:48,902
You understand?

1719
01:51:50,170 --> 01:51:53,306
Yes, sir. But perhaps
you should wait until he...

1720
01:51:53,339 --> 01:51:56,810
No, no. The thing is,
I have this cold and I wanna get home

1721
01:51:57,343 --> 01:51:59,212
and get in bed.

1722
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:02,382
Can you give him
the message?

1723
01:52:02,415 --> 01:52:03,817
Certainly.

1724
01:52:05,819 --> 01:52:07,087
Well, this is
the message.

1725
01:52:09,155 --> 01:52:11,825
"There is no deal for
Abel unless we get Powers and Pryor."

1726
01:52:13,359 --> 01:52:15,829
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.

1727
01:52:15,862 --> 01:52:17,030
It's arranged for
tomorrow morning.

1728
01:52:17,063 --> 01:52:19,399
It will not happen
unless we get two men.

1729
01:52:19,432 --> 01:52:21,134
Those two men.

1730
01:52:21,167 --> 01:52:22,836
Two, two, two.
Yes, sir.

1731
01:52:23,436 --> 01:52:26,206
If there is no deal,

1732
01:52:26,239 --> 01:52:27,874
your boss must tell
the Soviets.

1733
01:52:29,409 --> 01:52:31,144
He has to tell
the Soviets

1734
01:52:31,177 --> 01:52:33,213
that they are not
getting Rudolf Abel.

1735
01:52:35,415 --> 01:52:37,117
Yes, sir.

1736
01:52:40,053 --> 01:52:41,321
Oh, and tell him this.

1737
01:52:43,089 --> 01:52:46,059
That so far, Abel has been
a good soldier,

1738
01:52:46,092 --> 01:52:48,161
but he thinks
he's going home.

1739
01:52:50,363 --> 01:52:52,966
If we had to tell him
that he's not going home,

1740
01:52:52,999 --> 01:52:54,267
that the Soviets
don't even want him,

1741
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:55,902
that he's never
going home...

1742
01:52:55,935 --> 01:52:58,071
Well, I imagine his
behavior might change.

1743
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:03,009
And who will be held
responsible for that?

1744
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:08,081
That's a long message.

1745
01:53:08,114 --> 01:53:10,150
Uh, did you get it all?

1746
01:53:10,183 --> 01:53:12,352
Yes, sir. Got it.
Good.

1747
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:15,155
You're a good man.

1748
01:53:16,222 --> 01:53:17,223
Oh...

1749
01:53:18,124 --> 01:53:19,859
And also tell him

1750
01:53:19,893 --> 01:53:21,060
there's no deal
unless we hear

1751
01:53:21,094 --> 01:53:22,929
before the end of
business today.

1752
01:53:22,962 --> 01:53:24,230
He has the number.

1753
01:53:24,264 --> 01:53:26,266
If the exchange
isn't gonna happen,

1754
01:53:26,299 --> 01:53:28,334
no reason for everybody
to get up first thing in the morning.

1755
01:53:28,368 --> 01:53:32,071
No, sir,
that would be pointless.

1756
01:53:32,105 --> 01:53:34,908
You're kidding me!
You're kidding me!

1757
01:53:34,941 --> 01:53:37,110
Not really.
I need some change.

1758
01:53:37,143 --> 01:53:39,379
This is exactly
what you weren't supposed to do.

1759
01:53:39,412 --> 01:53:42,215
My instructions were
to feel out the situation.

1760
01:53:42,248 --> 01:53:45,051
Your instructions
were to get Powers, not Pryor.

1761
01:53:45,084 --> 01:53:47,320
That was not the original deal.
You fouled it all up!

1762
01:53:47,353 --> 01:53:49,989
How do you know?
I feel pretty good about it.

1763
01:53:50,023 --> 01:53:51,391
You fucked it all up!

1764
01:53:51,424 --> 01:53:53,226
Oh, don't worry.

1765
01:53:53,259 --> 01:53:55,361
I think it's
gonna be fine.

1766
01:53:55,395 --> 01:53:57,130
How do you know?
You don't know that.

1767
01:54:01,267 --> 01:54:03,369
United States.
New York, New York.

1768
01:54:03,403 --> 01:54:04,938
Danke.

1769
01:54:06,005 --> 01:54:08,975
Look, this whole thing

1770
01:54:09,008 --> 01:54:11,911
has been to feel me out.

1771
01:54:11,945 --> 01:54:14,247
Would I swap one for one
and which one?

1772
01:54:15,315 --> 01:54:17,283
But I said
"No, two for one."

1773
01:54:17,317 --> 01:54:19,252
So they know
where we stand.

1774
01:54:19,285 --> 01:54:21,321
Yeah, what if they think
about it and say, uh...

1775
01:54:21,354 --> 01:54:23,489
"Forget it! You keep our guy,
we keep your guys"?

1776
01:54:26,426 --> 01:54:28,528
Well, then I have
fucked it all up.

1777
01:54:28,561 --> 01:54:31,064
Hey, honey! It's me.

1778
01:54:31,097 --> 01:54:33,967
Yeah. The fishing's
been great.

1779
01:54:35,969 --> 01:54:37,303
I'm in London,

1780
01:54:37,337 --> 01:54:39,337
just for one more meeting,
then I'm on my way home.

1781
01:54:40,573 --> 01:54:44,043
Yeah, yeah, I remember
that marmalade.

1782
01:54:44,077 --> 01:54:46,179
It's that shop
right by Regent's Park.

1783
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:49,415
All right, I will
if I have the time.

1784
01:54:49,449 --> 01:54:51,217
Hey, can I say
hi to Roger?

1785
01:54:52,452 --> 01:54:54,120
Could I say hi
to the girls?

1786
01:54:55,054 --> 01:54:56,189
Is anyone not busy?

1787
01:54:57,423 --> 01:54:59,926
Have they even noticed
I'm not around?

1788
01:55:56,215 --> 01:55:57,350
We're on.

1789
01:55:58,451 --> 01:56:00,053
Two for one.

1790
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:03,089
Hot dog.

1791
01:56:03,122 --> 01:56:05,258
Let's have a drink.

1792
01:56:05,291 --> 01:56:08,027
One wrinkle.
What is that?

1793
01:56:08,061 --> 01:56:10,530
They won't release
Pryor with Powers, not at the bridge.

1794
01:56:10,563 --> 01:56:12,298
They'll release him
at the same time.

1795
01:56:12,332 --> 01:56:14,434
When the Russians give us
Powers on the bridge,

1796
01:56:14,467 --> 01:56:17,103
they'll release Pryor
over Checkpoint Charlie.

1797
01:56:17,136 --> 01:56:18,638
What does that mean?

1798
01:56:18,671 --> 01:56:22,141
I think it means,
"We wanna have the last word."

1799
01:56:23,176 --> 01:56:24,177
But they will do it.

1800
01:56:25,278 --> 01:56:26,479
You tell me.
You felt them out.

1801
01:56:47,567 --> 01:56:49,168
Where are they?

1802
01:56:49,202 --> 01:56:50,536
Where's our guy?
Where's our guy?

1803
01:56:50,570 --> 01:56:52,171
They're late.

1804
01:56:52,205 --> 01:56:54,140
Nobody's late.
We're early.

1805
01:56:54,173 --> 01:56:55,608
May I?
Yeah.

1806
01:57:02,582 --> 01:57:03,649
Hoffman.

1807
01:57:03,683 --> 01:57:05,218
Yeah?

1808
01:57:05,251 --> 01:57:06,686
I think they have...

1809
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:08,454
What?

1810
01:57:08,488 --> 01:57:10,356
...snipers.

1811
01:57:10,390 --> 01:57:11,657
Well,
I'm sure they do.

1812
01:57:12,558 --> 01:57:14,260
How are you
sure they do?

1813
01:57:14,727 --> 01:57:16,529
Because we have snipers.

1814
01:57:34,347 --> 01:57:35,481
Step out, sir.

1815
01:57:43,756 --> 01:57:45,191
Jim.

1816
01:57:49,429 --> 01:57:50,429
Dear Jim.

1817
01:57:52,465 --> 01:57:54,367
How are you?

1818
01:57:55,234 --> 01:57:57,403
Happy to see you.

1819
01:57:57,437 --> 01:57:59,372
Have you arranged
all this for me?

1820
01:57:59,405 --> 01:58:02,208
Well, let's see what this is before I...
I take credit for it.

1821
01:58:03,509 --> 01:58:05,445
Any word about Pryor
from Checkpoint Charlie?

1822
01:58:29,802 --> 01:58:31,504
Nothing cooking yet.

1823
01:58:38,244 --> 01:58:39,545
Excuse me, sir.

1824
01:58:39,579 --> 01:58:41,714
This is Lieutenant Joe Murphy,
United States Air Force,

1825
01:58:41,747 --> 01:58:43,483
here to identify Powers.

1826
01:58:44,250 --> 01:58:45,318
Lieutenant Murphy.

1827
01:58:45,751 --> 01:58:47,253
Sir.

1828
01:58:50,423 --> 01:58:52,225
There may be
a slight glitch.

1829
01:58:52,258 --> 01:58:54,393
I was a young man
when I left.

1830
01:58:54,427 --> 01:58:56,462
Who will they find
to identify me?

1831
01:58:57,697 --> 01:59:00,433
Well, I hope it's not your
East German family.

1832
01:59:00,466 --> 01:59:02,301
I doubt they could
identify each other.

1833
01:59:37,470 --> 01:59:38,671
Looks like our party.

1834
01:59:46,512 --> 01:59:48,814
Well, let's go.

1835
01:59:48,848 --> 01:59:50,516
You can stay here,
Donovan.

1836
01:59:51,651 --> 01:59:52,785
Not likely.

1837
01:59:55,354 --> 01:59:56,522
Open the gate.

1838
02:00:11,571 --> 02:00:13,539
What do you think will happen
when you get home?

1839
02:00:14,307 --> 02:00:15,608
Uh, I think...

1840
02:00:16,642 --> 02:00:18,578
I'll have a vodka.

1841
02:00:21,414 --> 02:00:22,481
Yeah.

1842
02:00:23,382 --> 02:00:24,650
Yeah.

1843
02:00:24,684 --> 02:00:27,486
But, Rudolf, is there
not the possibility...

1844
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:29,589
That my people
are going to shoot me?

1845
02:00:30,790 --> 02:00:31,824
Yes.

1846
02:00:33,626 --> 02:00:35,695
You're not worried?
Would it help?

1847
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:50,810
To answer your question,
my friend,

1848
02:00:50,843 --> 02:00:53,412
I acted honorably.
I think they know that.

1849
02:00:54,714 --> 02:00:56,582
But sometimes
people think wrong.

1850
02:00:56,616 --> 02:00:57,817
People are people.

1851
02:00:59,552 --> 02:01:00,886
Let's see how they
greet me.

1852
02:01:02,755 --> 02:01:04,390
What can I look for?

1853
02:01:07,360 --> 02:01:10,863
If I'm embraced or just
shown the back seat.

1854
02:01:51,604 --> 02:01:52,738
Da.

1855
02:02:05,551 --> 02:02:06,919
Take off the hat.

1856
02:02:13,492 --> 02:02:14,694
Hey, Powers.

1857
02:02:16,495 --> 02:02:17,763
Hey, Murph.

1858
02:02:19,632 --> 02:02:20,866
Yeah, that's Powers.

1859
02:02:23,703 --> 02:02:25,905
All right,
Mr. Donovan. We go now!

1860
02:02:25,938 --> 02:02:27,406
Hang on.

1861
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:35,981
Believe me,
I will tell you.

1862
02:02:38,050 --> 02:02:39,585
There's no one here.

1863
02:02:42,922 --> 02:02:44,990
They're releasing another man
at Checkpoint Charlie.

1864
02:02:45,024 --> 02:02:47,026
We're just confirming
that he's there.

1865
02:02:47,059 --> 02:02:48,661
Now!

1866
02:02:48,694 --> 02:02:49,995
As per plan,
if you please.

1867
02:02:51,597 --> 02:02:53,032
Let's go.

1868
02:02:53,065 --> 02:02:55,901
Pryor will show up
or he won't. Let's go.

1869
02:02:55,935 --> 02:02:58,804
They're waiting to see
if we'll do it without him.

1870
02:02:58,838 --> 02:03:00,740
We just have to stand here,
show them we won't.

1871
02:03:02,541 --> 02:03:03,676
I don't give a shit
what they want.

1872
02:03:03,709 --> 02:03:06,011
We have our objective.
Go ahead, Abel.

1873
02:03:07,813 --> 02:03:10,683
Go ahead, sir.
You can go.

1874
02:03:10,716 --> 02:03:12,785
If it is not to plan,
we go home.

1875
02:03:12,818 --> 02:03:14,754
We exchange now
or we go home!

1876
02:03:17,556 --> 02:03:19,759
You're waiting for another man?
Yup.

1877
02:03:20,826 --> 02:03:22,428
You want him, too.

1878
02:03:24,497 --> 02:03:25,731
I want him.

1879
02:03:25,765 --> 02:03:26,932
Doesn't matter
what he wants, sir.

1880
02:03:26,966 --> 02:03:28,768
I'm in charge and
you are free to go.

1881
02:03:29,702 --> 02:03:31,470
Please go.
Walk across.

1882
02:03:43,115 --> 02:03:44,517
I can wait.

1883
02:04:09,608 --> 02:04:11,977
It's something.
I'm not sure yet.

1884
02:04:14,046 --> 02:04:15,080
Hang on!

1885
02:05:00,059 --> 02:05:01,059
Let's go.

1886
02:05:07,733 --> 02:05:08,834
We got him!

1887
02:05:09,935 --> 02:05:11,103
Uh, I, uh...

1888
02:05:13,739 --> 02:05:15,574
I sent you a gift, Jim.

1889
02:05:16,675 --> 02:05:18,143
It's a...
It's a painting.

1890
02:05:19,879 --> 02:05:21,914
I hope it has some
meaning to you.

1891
02:05:24,149 --> 02:05:26,118
I'm sorry. I didn't think
to get you a gift.

1892
02:05:29,889 --> 02:05:31,757
This is your gift.

1893
02:05:35,094 --> 02:05:36,629
This is your gift.

1894
02:06:12,031 --> 02:06:13,031
You okay?

1895
02:06:14,867 --> 02:06:15,987
Let's go, let's go,
let's go!

1896
02:07:35,948 --> 02:07:37,916
Mr. Donovan.

1897
02:07:37,950 --> 02:07:39,885
Colonel Abel asked me
to give this to you.

1898
02:07:42,821 --> 02:07:43,956
Pardon me, sir.

1899
02:07:45,791 --> 02:07:47,271
Were you in charge
of this thing, sir?

1900
02:07:48,761 --> 02:07:50,896
Yeah.
Well, I gotta thank you.

1901
02:07:51,797 --> 02:07:53,032
I gotta thank somebody.

1902
02:08:10,249 --> 02:08:13,052
I gave them nothing.
I gave them nothing.

1903
02:08:14,253 --> 02:08:16,188
It doesn't matter.

1904
02:08:16,221 --> 02:08:18,824
It doesn't matter
what people think.

1905
02:08:18,857 --> 02:08:19,925
You know
what you did.

1906
02:09:10,943 --> 02:09:12,111
Welcome home.

1907
02:09:14,346 --> 02:09:15,914
What a trip.

1908
02:09:20,986 --> 02:09:22,154
Mmm.

1909
02:09:25,424 --> 02:09:26,925
Mmm.

1910
02:09:27,359 --> 02:09:28,961
You okay?

1911
02:09:29,394 --> 02:09:31,063
Yeah, I'm fine.

1912
02:09:32,998 --> 02:09:35,000
Did you get the marmalade?
Yes, yes.

1913
02:09:35,033 --> 02:09:37,069
Yep. Yep.

1914
02:09:37,936 --> 02:09:39,204
I did.

1915
02:09:40,906 --> 02:09:42,107
As ordered.

1916
02:09:46,278 --> 02:09:47,279
Jim.

1917
02:09:48,380 --> 02:09:50,449
This is from Arno's.
So?

1918
02:09:50,482 --> 02:09:52,985
On the corner!
Well, honey, I was busy.

1919
02:09:53,018 --> 02:09:54,953
I'm sorry. We were so busy.
Oh, for Pete's sake.

1920
02:09:54,987 --> 02:09:56,388
How's Roger? Is he home?
He's home.

1921
02:09:56,421 --> 02:09:58,924
Carol's home, Peggy's home.
Everyone's home.

1922
02:09:58,957 --> 02:10:01,093
Mom!
Come quick! Look!

1923
02:10:02,361 --> 02:10:04,396
- Mom, come here!
- Mom, come here!

1924
02:10:04,429 --> 02:10:06,965
- Come see this! Look! Watch!
- Come on!

1925
02:10:06,999 --> 02:10:09,301
Francis Gary Powers

1926
02:10:09,334 --> 02:10:13,272
has been released from prison
in the Soviet Union

1927
02:10:13,305 --> 02:10:15,374
and turned over to
American authorities

1928
02:10:15,407 --> 02:10:18,277
early this morning
in Berlin.

1929
02:10:18,310 --> 02:10:23,081
The President has commuted
the sentence of Rudolf Abel.

1930
02:10:23,115 --> 02:10:25,984
Mr. Abel has been
deported

1931
02:10:26,018 --> 02:10:28,453
and has been released
in Berlin.

1932
02:10:28,487 --> 02:10:32,090
Efforts to obtain
Mr. Powers' release

1933
02:10:32,124 --> 02:10:34,927
had been underway
for some time.

1934
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:36,461
In recent efforts,

1935
02:10:36,495 --> 02:10:38,497
the United States
government has had

1936
02:10:38,530 --> 02:10:43,035
the cooperation and assistance
of Mr. James B. Donovan,

1937
02:10:43,068 --> 02:10:45,370
a New York attorney.

1938
02:10:45,404 --> 02:10:49,007
Frederic L. Pryor,
an American student

1939
02:10:49,041 --> 02:10:51,910
held by East German
authorities

1940
02:10:51,944 --> 02:10:54,246
since August of 1961...

1941
02:10:54,279 --> 02:10:56,415
I thought Daddy
was fishing.

1942
02:10:56,448 --> 02:10:58,517
For salmon.

1943
02:10:58,550 --> 02:11:02,020
Abel now has disappeared
into the communist world.

1944
02:11:02,054 --> 02:11:04,289
Powers is here,
answering questions.

1945
02:11:04,323 --> 02:11:07,125
And Donovan has gone back
to his law practice.

1946
02:11:07,159 --> 02:11:09,294
And now, here is
George Fenneman,

1947
02:11:09,328 --> 02:11:11,396
speaking for the Douglas Fir
Plywood Association.
