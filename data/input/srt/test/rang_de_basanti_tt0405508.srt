00:01:12,186 --> 00:01:16,486
If yet your blood does not rage, then
it is waterthat flows in your veins.

2
00:01:17,758 --> 00:01:21,922
For what is the flush of youth,
if it is not of service to the motherland.

3
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:04,630
Just a minute Mr. McKinley,
one revolutionary is meeting another.

4
00:02:10,578 --> 00:02:12,705
Thank you.
Shall we go?

5
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,379
I'm sorry it had to end this way.

6
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:22,783
This isn't the end Mr. McKinley.
This is just the beginning.

7
00:02:23,924 --> 00:02:27,121
There will be others after
we have gone. Many others.

8
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:16,535
Shove it.

9
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:54,243
Get out of the way! Scoot!

10
00:08:54,448 --> 00:08:57,417
<i>You come India first time madam?
Yes!</i>

11
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:13,596
Sorry about the short notice.

12
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:17,760
Gosh! Your Hindi has
really improved.

13
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,436
Don't worry,
all the preparations are done.

14
00:09:34,488 --> 00:09:37,685
Hey Sue, no need to worry...

15
00:09:38,158 --> 00:09:42,219
...everything has been taken care of
posters have been put up everywhere.

16
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:43,963
It's also been announced on radio.

17
00:09:44,498 --> 00:09:46,557
...just see, they'll be lining
up forthe auditions.

18
00:09:49,503 --> 00:09:50,697
What's wrong?

19
00:09:52,673 --> 00:09:59,374
I didn't tell you.
The truth is that I've come alone.

20
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,980
...no money, no producer is going to arrive.

21
00:10:04,184 --> 00:10:06,482
You knew it!

22
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:13,057
After Alice, there was a
call from a certain Beth Williams...

23
00:10:13,527 --> 00:10:16,985
...she informed me of the cancellation
of the show and also my services.

24
00:10:19,867 --> 00:10:25,169
...did you abuse her in Hindi?

25
00:10:26,206 --> 00:10:31,940
She wanted to know what it meant.
I explained to her in graphic detail.

26
00:10:36,717 --> 00:10:39,277
You are amazing... Sonia.

27
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:06,702
This is Delhi University.
Let me help you with your luggage.

28
00:11:06,914 --> 00:11:10,111
<i>How much?
- Ma'am I've already told you.</i>

29
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:17,117
Ravi, please get all the
luggage to our room.

30
00:11:42,282 --> 00:11:44,580
Get some rest now.
I'll see you tomorrow...

31
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:47,348
...lf you need anything
you have my number.

32
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,257
Let's go Ravi.

33
00:12:55,489 --> 00:12:56,786
I can't do this.

34
00:13:01,328 --> 00:13:02,522
I can't do this.

35
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:11,866
I deserve a role because
I have dimples just like Priety Zinta.

36
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,179
<i>Don't sing. Just recite "Vande Matram".
- Vande Matram?</i>

37
00:14:13,734 --> 00:14:16,362
<i>Raise your hand and say VANDE MATRAM!
VANDE Matram!</i>

38
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,198
<i>Speak loudly, VANDE MATRAM!
Vande MATRAM.</i>

39
00:14:19,406 --> 00:14:22,864
<i>Loudly and proudly, VANDE MATRAM!
Vande MATRAM</i>

40
00:14:23,076 --> 00:14:25,374
<i>VANDE MATRAM!
Vande Matram...</i>

41
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,708
I have dedicated my life
to the freedom of this nation.

42
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,051
I have dedicated my life
to the freedom of this nation.

43
00:14:32,586 --> 00:14:34,554
I know you want me to get married.

44
00:14:35,088 --> 00:14:38,216
...but FREEDOM is my bride.

45
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,058
I know... I know... that...

46
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,896
I know... that you want me to get married...

47
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,567
...but my bride is FREEDOM

48
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:57,899
...but my bride is FREEDOM.
Your obedient son, BHAGAT SINGH.

49
00:14:58,712 --> 00:14:59,406
BHAGAT SINGH.

50
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:00,571
Bhagat Singh.

51
00:15:01,615 --> 00:15:02,411
Bhagat Singh.

52
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:07,419
My name is Bhagat Singh.

53
00:15:15,061 --> 00:15:18,030
<i>Tea!
Thanks.</i>

54
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:23,762
Depressed huh?

55
00:15:24,738 --> 00:15:27,866
One ortwo of them can
be used for minor roles...

56
00:15:28,475 --> 00:15:32,275
...but no one's even close for
Azad or Bhagat Singh.

57
00:15:32,646 --> 00:15:35,706
I guess it's all my fault.

58
00:15:35,982 --> 00:15:39,713
No Sonia. You're my rock.

59
00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:45,219
Sue, don't get so dejected.

60
00:15:47,828 --> 00:15:50,126
Let's go and have some fun.
I'm in no mood Sonia.

61
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:18,988
Hey Aslam.

62
00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:33,739
Aslam... Sue McKinley.

63
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:36,071
You too study at the University?

64
00:16:36,276 --> 00:16:38,073
Wow! Her Hindi is great.

65
00:16:38,612 --> 00:16:43,743
We live there, eat there but no one
has ever accused us of studying there.

66
00:17:11,978 --> 00:17:13,275
What are those maniacs upto?

67
00:17:14,314 --> 00:17:15,281
That's DJ...

68
00:17:15,582 --> 00:17:16,947
DJ I love you!!!

69
00:17:18,585 --> 00:17:19,552
That's Sukhi.

70
00:17:29,162 --> 00:17:30,561
DJ I love you!!!

71
00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:33,395
I love you too baby!

72
00:17:47,614 --> 00:17:48,808
Damn exhibitionists.

73
00:17:51,017 --> 00:17:52,314
The idiots will never change.

74
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:57,152
Come on dude, let's rock it!

75
00:18:01,528 --> 00:18:03,655
Sukhi I love you!

76
00:18:29,356 --> 00:18:30,220
Is he OK?

77
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:32,357
That's his natural state.

78
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:39,590
Sukhi, all parts working?

79
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,731
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

80
00:18:46,606 --> 00:18:49,234
Sue this is DJ.
DJ this is Sue.

81
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:50,034
Hi!

82
00:18:51,077 --> 00:18:54,877
Sue? She's so pink her name
should be Gulabo (Rose).

83
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,217
She's quite hot...

84
00:18:58,418 --> 00:19:00,886
Perfect forthis cold.

85
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:10,723
Karan you saved my life.
I love you!

86
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:12,727
Aslam...

87
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:15,230
...you too saved my life,

88
00:19:15,935 --> 00:19:17,334
I love you too!

89
00:19:17,771 --> 00:19:19,739
It's ok.

90
00:19:23,443 --> 00:19:25,240
She must have saved my life too...

91
00:19:25,445 --> 00:19:27,572
No! Sukhi!
She didn't save your life.

92
00:19:27,781 --> 00:19:30,409
No problem. One day
she'll save my life.

93
00:19:30,784 --> 00:19:36,689
Relax Dude!
She is your sister-in-law.

94
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:48,561
LOOSE CONTROL

95
00:19:56,876 --> 00:20:10,779
I'm a REBEL.

96
00:20:11,157 --> 00:20:16,959
<i>There's aren't any students here,
no teachers to suffer.</i>

97
00:20:23,837 --> 00:20:29,639
<i>It's a school without rules out here
Hey Genius, go figure.</i>

98
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,983
Sukhi you just sit and
watch like a dumb-ass...

99
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:46,890
DJ doesn't waste a second.

100
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:48,424
He's a stud.

101
00:20:48,628 --> 00:20:51,096
Hi! How's everybody?
Hi Rahul! What's up?

102
00:20:52,198 --> 00:20:53,495
Got a few gigs lined up.

103
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,327
How's your radio thing going?

104
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:58,332
Did anything work out?

105
00:20:58,805 --> 00:21:00,670
All India Radio has
given me a night slot.

106
00:21:01,374 --> 00:21:02,568
Cool...

107
00:21:03,376 --> 00:21:07,904
Not really. When the whole world's
sleeping I'm on air.

108
00:21:08,114 --> 00:21:09,911
But people stay up late...

109
00:21:10,717 --> 00:21:14,414
Criminals, insomniacs,
watchmen and idiots!

110
00:21:15,221 --> 00:21:17,587
Have yourfun at my expense.

111
00:21:18,057 --> 00:21:19,183
Speaking of expenses...
Can I...

112
00:21:29,836 --> 00:21:32,031
See you guys.
Got a cigarette?

113
00:21:38,244 --> 00:21:40,041
Fabulous!

114
00:21:40,747 --> 00:21:43,045
It's my Dad's money.
He's got lots of it...

115
00:21:51,925 --> 00:21:53,392
Stop this Western music,
this obscenity!

116
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,887
How many times do
I have to make you understand this!

117
00:21:57,764 --> 00:22:00,062
Polluting the culture of this country...

118
00:22:00,433 --> 00:22:03,561
Leave this place right now.
LEAVE!

119
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:07,069
Can't you understand, idiot!

120
00:22:08,308 --> 00:22:10,902
This is your last warning...

121
00:22:12,212 --> 00:22:16,672
...from now on, nobody plays
any Western music out here.

122
00:22:17,784 --> 00:22:18,910
No lewd dancing!

123
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:25,182
Or I'll break your legs.

124
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:28,427
Who are you to warn us?
If you don't like it, don't come here.

125
00:22:28,628 --> 00:22:30,596
You bloody Pakistani!

126
00:22:36,636 --> 00:22:38,934
Let's finish it.

127
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:01,358
Last warning! Got it?

128
00:23:05,665 --> 00:23:06,689
Long live India!

129
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,873
You touch Aslam and
see what I do to you...

130
00:23:17,076 --> 00:23:19,135
...even your mother won't recognize you.

131
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,943
Ever seen a baboons arse? Yours will
be as red after I've finished with you.

132
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:29,814
Sir, I'm sure we can work it out.

133
00:23:35,695 --> 00:23:39,153
Keep this...

134
00:23:44,537 --> 00:23:48,667
Anyone hungry? I'm famished.

135
00:25:49,328 --> 00:25:49,953
How're you?

136
00:25:51,497 --> 00:25:54,057
Hey honey! Come here you...

137
00:25:57,503 --> 00:26:00,301
If something happened to you,
I'd have killed you.

138
00:26:00,673 --> 00:26:02,300
Is this any way to greet your boyfriend?

139
00:26:05,511 --> 00:26:05,977
How're you?

140
00:26:22,028 --> 00:26:23,222
Hurry guys, I'm famished.

141
00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:24,987
You won't get any food here.

142
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:31,666
Stay away!

143
00:26:31,871 --> 00:26:34,339
...I carried you in my stomach
for nine months...

144
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,168
...and washed your bum foryears.

145
00:26:37,977 --> 00:26:38,568
Get lost!

146
00:26:39,145 --> 00:26:42,342
Does anyone botherto check
if Mitro is alive or dead?

147
00:26:42,548 --> 00:26:43,344
What's up?

148
00:26:44,383 --> 00:26:45,350
You're drunk again.

149
00:26:45,718 --> 00:26:48,346
No. No. No.

150
00:26:48,621 --> 00:26:51,351
First give us food ma,
and then yell at us all night.

151
00:26:52,592 --> 00:26:55,186
None of you have eaten?

152
00:26:55,394 --> 00:26:58,693
Sonia you've lost even more weight.

153
00:26:58,898 --> 00:26:59,523
Really... Mitro

154
00:26:59,732 --> 00:27:03,532
The girls of today have
more bones and less flesh...

155
00:27:03,736 --> 00:27:05,363
How will you bear children?

156
00:27:09,242 --> 00:27:12,939
Aslam, how are you my son?

157
00:27:13,145 --> 00:27:15,705
He is my true son
who bothers to check on me.

158
00:27:15,915 --> 00:27:19,715
And you...

159
00:27:21,254 --> 00:27:24,382
Look ma, what I brought foryou.

160
00:27:24,757 --> 00:27:28,056
Your daughter-in-law.
Her name is Sue.

161
00:27:28,261 --> 00:27:30,889
What? Aforeigner?

162
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:35,332
Brought her especially from London.
That's why I was away for so long.

163
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:40,232
Give me your blessings Ma.

164
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,233
Your son's such a brat.

165
00:27:44,777 --> 00:27:50,738
God! She understands Hindi!

166
00:27:53,452 --> 00:27:58,253
<i>You really understand everything?
Yes.</i>

167
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:07,524
I'm going off to sleep. Your beds are
all ready. No need to drive so late at night.

168
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,307
Sue, where are you?

169
00:28:50,343 --> 00:28:52,038
Will you guys act in my film?

170
00:28:52,678 --> 00:28:53,303
What?

171
00:28:57,683 --> 00:29:01,483
Hey, why are you guys laughing?
I'm the hero of herfilm.

172
00:29:02,688 --> 00:29:04,485
Yeah we guys are champions
when it comes to acting...

173
00:29:04,857 --> 00:29:06,654
...clowning around is all they do.

174
00:29:09,362 --> 00:29:12,593
The four of you will be
perfect forthe roles...

175
00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:17,498
And Sonia will be my Durga Bhabhi.

176
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,394
She really knows Hindi!

177
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:23,340
All this talk of patriotism is boring.

178
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:27,603
Boring? These guys gave their
lives forthe freedom of your country.

179
00:29:28,047 --> 00:29:30,515
What freedom? Have you seen
the state of this country?

180
00:29:32,218 --> 00:29:33,685
Excuse me! I believe in this country, Karan.

181
00:29:34,053 --> 00:29:38,683
Otherwise, why would
I be fighting for it?

182
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:43,017
Maybe because it's cool!
Being a pilot... flying an expensive plane.

183
00:29:43,396 --> 00:29:44,522
You get to wear sexy jackets...

184
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:48,860
And the women...
women love men in uniforms.

185
00:29:49,101 --> 00:29:51,535
Sure I love being a pilot.
Sure it's cool.

186
00:29:51,704 --> 00:29:55,538
But I also feel proud of my country,
and I can give my life for it.

187
00:29:56,275 --> 00:29:59,369
Proud of what?

188
00:29:59,578 --> 00:30:00,636
...this country's exploding population?

189
00:30:00,746 --> 00:30:02,873
...or unemployment...
or corruption?

190
00:30:03,249 --> 00:30:04,546
Which of these are you really proud of?

191
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,652
No country's perfect Karan.
We've got to make it better.

192
00:30:08,854 --> 00:30:09,320
Right.

193
00:30:10,756 --> 00:30:13,782
Ok, Ajay you make
this country perfect.

194
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,891
The minute I get my degree
I'm out of this dump...

195
00:30:18,097 --> 00:30:20,565
You won't be able
to leave us and go.

196
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:23,229
She speaks Hindi so well!

197
00:30:26,372 --> 00:30:31,469
Why didn't you tell me you idiot.
I was making a fool of myself.

198
00:30:37,717 --> 00:30:40,811
At least ask them once.

199
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,146
So you won't give up.

200
00:30:43,956 --> 00:30:47,255
Ok. But nobody will turn up.

201
00:30:48,127 --> 00:30:54,430
I'll get them. That's a promise.

202
00:30:58,971 --> 00:31:00,939
Karan put your cigarette out.

203
00:31:04,076 --> 00:31:05,100
Grandpa!

204
00:31:05,811 --> 00:31:08,780
God bless you.
When did you come?

205
00:31:08,981 --> 00:31:13,042
Just last night.

206
00:31:56,228 --> 00:32:00,130
Good morning Karan.
Back so early?

207
00:32:02,234 --> 00:32:03,861
I didn't know you were in town.

208
00:32:05,404 --> 00:32:06,928
Just arrived an hour ago.

209
00:32:07,807 --> 00:32:11,800
It was a long flight...
Everything Ok at college?

210
00:32:13,078 --> 00:32:13,703
Everything's fine Dad.

211
00:32:13,913 --> 00:32:17,371
Have you decided which American
university you want to go to next year?

212
00:32:18,984 --> 00:32:24,251
Michigan, Carnegie,
Mellon, Wharton...

213
00:32:24,423 --> 00:32:25,390
I know the list.

214
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:31,225
Hello...

215
00:32:31,697 --> 00:32:32,561
Karan wait!

216
00:32:34,433 --> 00:32:38,893
I can't hearyou clearly
call me later.

217
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:43,164
I know that you know about the lists.

218
00:32:44,543 --> 00:32:46,511
But life doesn't just happen to you.

219
00:32:47,313 --> 00:32:48,803
You've got to plan it...

220
00:32:49,949 --> 00:32:52,645
Every second someone
is born in this country.

221
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,248
Nobody cares about them.
Neitherthe government nor God.

222
00:32:58,457 --> 00:33:04,191
Do something.
Or else you will be one of them.

223
00:33:04,463 --> 00:33:06,260
Please, don't start with your lectures.

224
00:33:07,633 --> 00:33:11,592
SMS generation.
Any conversation that goes beyond...

225
00:33:11,804 --> 00:33:12,930
...four lines becomes a lecture.

226
00:33:16,876 --> 00:33:21,279
Signal's weak here. Give me a second.
Excuse me Karan.

227
00:33:23,148 --> 00:33:27,448
The deal is off then,
we are not interested...

228
00:33:31,257 --> 00:33:34,454
You know Russian quality is doubtful,
they can't afford to be arrogant.

229
00:33:37,229 --> 00:33:41,598
Anyway in the open market they'd not get
anything close to the price we're offering.

230
00:33:41,734 --> 00:33:46,569
And you know how many fathers
there are to every deal in India. Nothing.

231
00:33:47,206 --> 00:33:56,979
Tell them we won't bargain,
they should wire the money to us.

232
00:34:22,074 --> 00:34:24,975
I did try to warn you...
they won't turn up.

233
00:34:25,177 --> 00:34:26,804
DJ promised me.

234
00:34:27,012 --> 00:34:28,877
Oh! DJ promised you!

235
00:34:29,214 --> 00:34:30,681
So you really are a filmmaker?

236
00:34:30,883 --> 00:34:33,909
Karan... Why are you so late?

237
00:34:35,554 --> 00:34:36,521
And where are the others?

238
00:34:39,558 --> 00:34:43,688
The Young Guns Of India.
Very dramatic.

239
00:34:46,865 --> 00:34:49,561
Where are you going?

240
00:34:49,802 --> 00:34:52,327
Well that's one part cast.

241
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:56,434
I am sure Karan can tell us
where his friends are.

242
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,523
She's an eight. Yeah!

243
00:35:12,858 --> 00:35:13,722
Wow! Nine.

244
00:35:13,926 --> 00:35:15,325
<i>What a girl!
Oye Chotu...</i>

245
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:17,256
...get me a cup of tea...

246
00:35:17,463 --> 00:35:19,192
Two, looks like she's got the flu...

247
00:35:22,534 --> 00:35:23,159
Six...

248
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:27,470
Ten!
What?

249
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:33,007
Dude... Iooks at those legs!

250
00:35:34,213 --> 00:35:37,182
Shake it baby, shake it...

251
00:35:37,783 --> 00:35:38,442
Oh shit!

252
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,277
Don't be silly,
that's at least an eight.

253
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:43,216
Thought I'd find you
stuffing yourfaces.

254
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:46,084
You lazy good-for-nothings.

255
00:35:46,525 --> 00:35:48,550
We were about to come... but...

256
00:35:48,794 --> 00:35:50,728
...we are waiting for Karan actually.

257
00:35:51,163 --> 00:35:52,494
<i>Oh! So you were waiting for Karan.
Yeah!</i>

258
00:35:53,132 --> 00:35:54,759
Karan was there on time.

259
00:35:56,602 --> 00:35:59,469
We are waiting for him here
and he was waiting for us there.

260
00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:01,832
What confusion...

261
00:36:04,076 --> 00:36:05,771
You're Ashfaqulla Khan.

262
00:36:06,512 --> 00:36:08,503
<i>You're Rajguru.
The hero right!</i>

263
00:36:08,714 --> 00:36:10,113
And you know who you are?

264
00:36:10,449 --> 00:36:13,043
The Master of Disguise
and Deception.

265
00:36:13,252 --> 00:36:14,412
Chandrashekhar Azad.

266
00:36:15,454 --> 00:36:16,785
What lips...

267
00:36:17,289 --> 00:36:19,883
Learn the lines properly,
we meet tomorrow.

268
00:36:20,492 --> 00:36:23,188
8 a.m. Sharp!

269
00:36:23,395 --> 00:36:25,659
<i>Nine.
Sharp at eight.</i>

270
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:28,662
<i>That's fine.
We've already wasted a day...</i>

271
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,341
Aslam, your sister-in-law looks
even better when she's angry.

272
00:36:49,088 --> 00:36:50,248
What are you doing Laxman?

273
00:36:53,325 --> 00:36:54,622
Greetings Mishraji.

274
00:36:54,993 --> 00:36:57,791
Party High Command is really
happy with your work.

275
00:36:58,297 --> 00:37:02,700
These demonstrations that you have
started against Western culture...

276
00:37:03,102 --> 00:37:06,594
...they've helped us
overshadow other parties.

277
00:37:13,979 --> 00:37:19,383
This is foryou.
And this is foryour boys.

278
00:37:20,452 --> 00:37:22,181
It's not necessary, Mishraji.

279
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:24,579
I'm not doing this for money.

280
00:37:25,057 --> 00:37:27,651
I really believe in the
principles of my party.

281
00:37:28,594 --> 00:37:30,061
That's fine Laxman...

282
00:37:30,696 --> 00:37:36,601
...but every movement
needs fuel... Keep it.

283
00:37:58,757 --> 00:38:03,285
There is nothing
you can do to break me.

284
00:38:03,662 --> 00:38:06,256
"Because I have made pain my friend."

285
00:38:06,899 --> 00:38:10,562
"...As I hold Death's fingers."

286
00:38:23,015 --> 00:38:26,007
DJ idiot, don't spoil my concentration.

287
00:38:30,389 --> 00:38:31,981
Look, Death's finger.

288
00:38:35,527 --> 00:38:38,121
"I've committed my life
to the freedom of this country.

289
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:42,130
...I know you want me to get married,
but I have made freedom my bride..."

290
00:38:42,334 --> 00:38:44,802
"Your obedient son, Bhagat Singh."

291
00:38:46,572 --> 00:38:49,234
Who talks like this for
God's sake?

292
00:38:49,441 --> 00:38:51,136
My bride is freedom...

293
00:38:51,443 --> 00:38:53,843
I think it's a good line for Sukhi...

294
00:38:54,046 --> 00:38:55,741
Since no girl is ever going to marry him...

295
00:38:55,981 --> 00:38:58,347
Let freedom be his bride.

296
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,984
Laugh bastards, laugh.

297
00:39:25,277 --> 00:39:27,609
This is the sari round
of the Miss Freedom contest.

298
00:39:28,647 --> 00:39:31,207
Just thought it would help
me get into the character.

299
00:39:37,022 --> 00:39:39,183
Look guys this isn't going to work.

300
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:43,991
You have to work hard to bring
out the characters.

301
00:39:44,663 --> 00:39:48,292
Unless you emote from within...

302
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:50,228
...you won't understand these characters.

303
00:39:51,637 --> 00:39:55,004
Try... it will come from within you.

304
00:39:55,207 --> 00:39:56,674
BURP

305
00:39:56,908 --> 00:39:59,900
See, he's got a hold of his character already.

306
00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:03,080
You understood the character pretty fast.

307
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,519
See! Now you look like a revolutionary!

308
00:40:09,087 --> 00:40:12,147
Whateveryou say Gulabo,
you need me to create the mood.

309
00:40:13,025 --> 00:40:14,822
DJ watch it.

310
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,818
Now she's upset!

311
00:40:24,036 --> 00:40:27,528
Those are the words of a 23 year old.

312
00:40:28,006 --> 00:40:31,169
That's how old Bhagat Singh
was when he died: 23.

313
00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:33,370
Those were different times Sue.

314
00:40:33,812 --> 00:40:39,011
Today, if you tell people that
you want to give your life foryour country...

315
00:40:39,584 --> 00:40:40,573
...they'll call you nuts.

316
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:42,615
Exactly.

317
00:40:44,122 --> 00:40:47,353
I don't think I can relate to this...

318
00:40:49,294 --> 00:40:50,625
That's it. Don't think.

319
00:40:51,163 --> 00:40:55,691
Feel. Just read the words,
Feel them.

320
00:40:57,202 --> 00:40:58,829
Why don't we try again?

321
00:40:59,404 --> 00:41:00,996
Let's try again...

322
00:41:03,075 --> 00:41:07,205
I've committed my life to
the freedom of this country.

323
00:41:09,448 --> 00:41:14,750
...a job... a well settled life...
these things don't matter anymore.

324
00:41:15,587 --> 00:41:24,655
...I know you want me to get married,
but I have made freedom my bride...

325
00:41:36,508 --> 00:41:42,174
I swear on Mother India...

326
00:41:55,961 --> 00:41:57,758
This Aslam is a real stud...

327
00:41:59,531 --> 00:42:04,833
Take a look at the packaging.
Poetry, palmistry!

328
00:42:05,804 --> 00:42:10,503
DJ, I'm scared at times that
I'll remain a bachelor all my life.

329
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:15,978
Trust me I won't let you die a bachelor.

330
00:42:16,181 --> 00:42:16,806
Promise?

331
00:42:17,716 --> 00:42:18,705
It's DJ's promise.

332
00:42:22,521 --> 00:42:28,118
You'll be writing people's destinies...

333
00:42:40,038 --> 00:42:41,801
Your love line is very strong...

334
00:42:42,841 --> 00:42:46,504
The man of your dreams will come
along in a black T-shirt and say:

335
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:55,183
Do I even have a love line?

336
00:42:55,387 --> 00:42:57,150
You must have washed it off in the loo.

337
00:42:57,355 --> 00:43:02,850
"Defence Minister Shastri has also been
implicated in the MIG-21 kickbacks scandal,"

338
00:43:03,061 --> 00:43:06,997
This is really depressing.

339
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:10,225
"This is a blatant lie.
I am ordering an investigation."

340
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:49,159
See you guys.

341
00:44:49,935 --> 00:44:53,098
You're my buddy...
I'll drop you home.

342
00:44:53,305 --> 00:44:56,206
I don't need any help,
it's just two lanes away.

343
00:44:56,841 --> 00:45:00,277
We aren't so drunk...
that we've forgotten where you live.

344
00:45:13,592 --> 00:45:14,752
Idiots!

345
00:45:16,494 --> 00:45:18,257
You're very lucky to
have friends like them.

346
00:45:24,302 --> 00:45:26,770
One day this will all end.

347
00:45:27,973 --> 00:45:29,770
We'll all go our separate ways.

348
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:33,435
But you can always keep in touch.

349
00:45:34,379 --> 00:45:35,539
Doesn't happen.

350
00:45:36,748 --> 00:45:38,306
Life gets busy.

351
00:45:39,084 --> 00:45:42,281
Too many problems.
Getting a job, a house, money.

352
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:55,966
In college we are the
masters of our destinies...

353
00:45:56,768 --> 00:45:58,963
But after college we have
to dance to fate's tune.

354
00:46:05,777 --> 00:46:11,409
You know Gulabo.
I passed out 5 years ago...

355
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,074
...but I still hang around...

356
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:16,578
I don't understand.

357
00:46:17,789 --> 00:46:20,849
...I don't ever want to leave college.

358
00:46:21,926 --> 00:46:22,551
Why?

359
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:29,533
At least in the campus
I'm someone... people know me.

360
00:46:30,702 --> 00:46:32,567
DJ's somebody...

361
00:46:34,939 --> 00:46:39,967
People expect me to do
something big in life.

362
00:46:42,414 --> 00:46:45,645
But when I'm out on the streets...

363
00:46:46,551 --> 00:46:51,716
I'll just be like the rest of
the slobs in this country.

364
00:47:02,567 --> 00:47:04,660
Nameless. Faceless. Scared.
Just walking the streets...

365
00:47:05,603 --> 00:47:09,130
It's the beer...
Everything came out.

366
00:47:13,244 --> 00:47:16,805
You know what else
I'm scared of?

367
00:47:18,516 --> 00:47:20,108
Acting in yourfilm.

368
00:47:21,786 --> 00:47:24,346
Don't worry... you're in safe hands.

369
00:47:45,076 --> 00:47:46,008
Where have you been?

370
00:47:47,645 --> 00:47:48,543
Hello Uncle... How are you?

371
00:47:53,818 --> 00:47:58,084
We'll catch up tomorrow Aslam...

372
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:06,326
You've been drinking?

373
00:48:07,465 --> 00:48:10,662
Dad, you know I don't drink.

374
00:48:11,102 --> 00:48:14,469
<i>Good-for-nothings...
Whatever, they're my friends.</i>

375
00:48:14,672 --> 00:48:18,403
Friends! They feel no
shame standing in front of...

376
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:21,374
...yourfather with alcohol on their breath.

377
00:48:21,713 --> 00:48:24,409
Why can't you get friends
in your own community?

378
00:48:25,116 --> 00:48:28,552
Why do you make friends with people
who corrupt you, disgrace your religion...

379
00:48:28,753 --> 00:48:30,448
This has nothing to
do with religion, Father.

380
00:48:30,655 --> 00:48:35,456
Shut up! Don't raise your voice
in the presence of yourfather.

381
00:48:36,928 --> 00:48:37,860
He's right.

382
00:48:39,631 --> 00:48:45,228
This country has never accepted
Muslims and it never will...

383
00:48:45,804 --> 00:48:47,237
How can you be so passive!

384
00:48:48,873 --> 00:48:51,808
Do you ever see me
mixing with a Hindu?

385
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:56,612
I'm not you and I don't want
to be like you brother.

386
00:48:58,349 --> 00:48:59,816
I can't fill myself with so much hate...

387
00:49:00,652 --> 00:49:02,882
Coward that's what you are.

388
00:49:03,087 --> 00:49:04,748
Stop it!

389
00:49:04,956 --> 00:49:07,982
I feel suffocated in this house.
It's the same old thing every single day...

390
00:49:19,971 --> 00:49:22,997
Carnivals will be held on our
graves every year,

391
00:49:23,775 --> 00:49:27,768
That's all that will be left of us,
when we die for our country.

392
00:49:27,979 --> 00:49:30,777
Well said Ashfaq Sahab...

393
00:49:31,282 --> 00:49:33,614
If the English could hearyou they
would leave this country in a moment.

394
00:49:35,987 --> 00:49:37,113
So what has been decided?

395
00:49:38,122 --> 00:49:44,186
We'll steal the Empire's money
from the train that passes Kakori.

396
00:49:45,163 --> 00:49:47,131
And with that money we will buy arms.

397
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:50,394
Bismil will explain everything.

398
00:49:50,602 --> 00:49:53,366
Yes Bismil... Where is my Ram?

399
00:49:56,207 --> 00:49:58,368
Ljust can't find my
Ramprasad Bismil.

400
00:49:58,576 --> 00:50:00,043
Relax. We will find him.

401
00:50:00,245 --> 00:50:01,837
But where? How?

402
00:50:02,146 --> 00:50:04,205
Very soon. Don't you wo...

403
00:50:06,684 --> 00:50:08,879
You won't get Ramprasad
Bismil out here.

404
00:50:10,121 --> 00:50:12,214
You need a true Indian.

405
00:50:13,157 --> 00:50:15,125
How can you find Indian
revolutionaries amongst...

406
00:50:15,894 --> 00:50:18,522
...people who want to be Westerners?

407
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:20,163
Ignore him. Let's go.

408
00:50:20,365 --> 00:50:23,698
Ramprasad Bismil wished to
be reborn a hundred times...

409
00:50:25,803 --> 00:50:29,000
...so that he could give his life for his
country a hundred times over.

410
00:50:29,207 --> 00:50:30,435
Let's go Sue.

411
00:50:31,676 --> 00:50:35,339
So where do you think
I can find my Bismil?

412
00:50:41,085 --> 00:50:42,245
I don't believe this.

413
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:50,384
This day, we walk along with death,
and laugh at its pale spectre.

414
00:50:51,596 --> 00:50:57,193
We will not fearthose cruel swords,
our courage is far sharper.

415
00:50:58,002 --> 00:51:06,341
Mistake not our silence for submission.
For beneath lies lava, molten.

416
00:51:09,047 --> 00:51:18,513
<i>O Martyre, O men of valour.
One day the enemy will sing your praises.</i>

417
00:51:19,424 --> 00:51:23,656
We will show our mettle
when the moment of truth arrives...

418
00:51:23,861 --> 00:51:29,163
...for courage lives in deeds,
not boastful lies.

419
00:51:29,667 --> 00:51:33,330
We've gathered in the enemy's lair,
my friend...

420
00:51:33,538 --> 00:51:37,406
In the hope of dying for our motherland.

421
00:51:37,608 --> 00:51:42,238
We will not fearthose cruel swords,
our courage is far sharper.

422
00:51:42,447 --> 00:51:48,750
This day, we walk along with death,
and laugh at its pale spectre.

423
00:51:49,787 --> 00:51:55,953
We will not fearthose cruel swords,
our courage is far sharper.

424
00:52:07,672 --> 00:52:10,539
Sue, this isn't London.
You don't know what kind...

425
00:52:10,742 --> 00:52:11,766
...of scum, men like Laxman Pandey are.

426
00:52:11,976 --> 00:52:15,935
Look Sue if he is a part of this,
then I can't do the film.

427
00:52:16,147 --> 00:52:18,945
If you have any problems
with me say it on my face.

428
00:52:19,417 --> 00:52:23,376
Don't stab me in the back like a coward.

429
00:52:23,721 --> 00:52:26,383
Pandey leave!
We don't want trouble...

430
00:52:26,991 --> 00:52:29,391
Speak you coward.
What were you saying?

431
00:52:30,528 --> 00:52:33,258
Aslam, where are you going?

432
00:52:35,933 --> 00:52:36,865
Coward, what were you saying?

433
00:52:38,069 --> 00:52:41,527
Hey you! How dare you hit Aslam?

434
00:52:50,748 --> 00:52:51,976
SUKHI

435
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:54,882
Thrash him.

436
00:53:15,373 --> 00:53:21,608
I'm sorry,
I took you guys in my film.

437
00:53:23,181 --> 00:53:25,547
God knows what made me come here...

438
00:54:42,894 --> 00:54:45,829
You know we've got a problem
with Pandey. There's a lot of bad blood.

439
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:51,263
<i>And if I stay, it's sure to happen again.
No, Sue.</i>

440
00:54:51,569 --> 00:54:52,593
We've worked it out.

441
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:54,394
You won't have any problems.

442
00:55:00,978 --> 00:55:06,473
Sue... we all know how much
this film means to you.

443
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:11,413
We want to help you finish
what you came here to do.

444
00:55:13,824 --> 00:55:15,189
Everyone wants you to stay.

445
00:55:15,993 --> 00:55:17,187
I want you to stay.

446
00:55:21,966 --> 00:55:26,596
Say something...

447
00:55:29,707 --> 00:55:32,369
Don't worry, you're in safe hands.

448
00:55:35,246 --> 00:55:37,407
Come on... Get up... Come here.

449
00:55:53,631 --> 00:55:56,566
She's not going anywhere.

450
00:56:01,439 --> 00:56:02,633
Now just chill.

451
00:58:02,426 --> 00:58:15,931
<i>Take some soil of my land,
the scent of this air...</i>

452
00:58:16,073 --> 00:58:20,237
<i>Add the breath of my being,
the throbbing of my heart...</i>

453
00:58:20,444 --> 00:58:26,405
<i>And the zeal, that
races through my blood...</i>

454
00:58:26,784 --> 00:58:31,244
<i>Take all these, and stir it.
Then watch as it brings out the colour...</i>

455
00:58:31,455 --> 00:58:35,755
<i>Take all these, and stir it.
Then watch as it brings out the colour...</i>

456
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,420
<i>Watch as it brings out
the colour of patriotism, my friend.</i>

457
00:58:42,967 --> 00:58:56,279
<i>Watch as it brings out the colour.</i>

458
00:59:09,326 --> 00:59:11,123
Bismil's sent a message...

459
00:59:11,328 --> 00:59:12,625
...that the Lucknow train...

460
00:59:13,664 --> 00:59:17,122
...carrying the Empire's money...
will be looted by us in Kakori...

461
00:59:17,501 --> 00:59:19,128
...while eating Kakori kababs.

462
00:59:19,837 --> 00:59:23,136
And we will buy bombs with that money.

463
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:26,138
Leave her alone...
She will stop giving milk.

464
00:59:26,343 --> 00:59:29,972
<i>Give colour to your dreams.
And those of your people.</i>

465
00:59:30,848 --> 00:59:34,978
<i>Give colour to your happiness.
And your sadness too.</i>

466
00:59:35,352 --> 00:59:39,311
<i>Give colour to generations...
Give colour to the field...</i>

467
00:59:40,024 --> 00:59:42,322
<i>Give colour to the beat of your heart.
And that of your music.</i>

468
00:59:42,526 --> 00:59:44,653
<i>Give colour to every cheek.
Give colour to your eyes...</i>

469
00:59:44,862 --> 00:59:46,989
<i>Watch as it brings out the
colour of patriotism my friend.</i>

470
00:59:47,198 --> 00:59:48,995
<i>Watch as it brings out the colour...</i>

471
00:59:50,034 --> 00:59:58,601
<i>Take some soil of my land,
the scent of this air...</i>

472
00:59:58,843 --> 01:00:03,337
<i>Add the breath of my being,
the throbbing of my heart.</i>

473
01:00:03,547 --> 01:00:09,349
<i>And the zeal, that races
through my blood.</i>

474
01:00:09,887 --> 01:00:14,187
<i>Take all these and stir it.
Then watch as it brings out the colour.</i>

475
01:00:14,558 --> 01:00:18,688
<i>Take all these and stir it.
Then watch as it brings out the colour.</i>

476
01:00:18,896 --> 01:00:21,524
<i>Watch as it brings out the
colour of patriotism, my friend.</i>

477
01:00:21,732 --> 01:00:23,359
<i>Watch as it brings out the colour.</i>

478
01:00:28,539 --> 01:00:29,437
Hey Short-stuff!

479
01:00:29,807 --> 01:00:31,206
Did you get Bismil's message?

480
01:00:31,408 --> 01:00:32,705
<i>No.
No! Then Listen...</i>

481
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:36,209
The train that's Kakori...
will be looted in eight days.

482
01:00:36,914 --> 01:00:38,541
It's loaded with the Empire's money.

483
01:00:38,749 --> 01:00:40,216
Will you loot it?
No.

484
01:00:40,417 --> 01:00:42,544
We will be buying arms from it.

485
01:00:43,087 --> 01:00:44,554
<i>What will we buy?
Arms...</i>

486
01:00:44,755 --> 01:00:46,052
Yes... Very Good... go now.

487
01:00:46,423 --> 01:00:50,382
<i>On a slow fire, won't you,
put this passion to cook.</i>

488
01:00:50,828 --> 01:00:55,390
<i>Then as it simmers,
add a babbling brook.</i>

489
01:00:55,633 --> 01:01:01,230
<i>Add a river, and an ocean.
Maybe a pot of water.</i>

490
01:01:01,438 --> 01:01:04,896
<i>Then sprinkle a bit. Stir it all up.
And watch as it brings out the colour.</i>

491
01:01:05,109 --> 01:01:09,569
<i>Watch as it brings out
the colour of patriotism, my friend.</i>

492
01:01:11,282 --> 01:01:12,579
Bismil has sent a message...

493
01:01:13,617 --> 01:01:15,084
...the Lucknow train...

494
01:01:15,286 --> 01:01:16,913
...which carries the Empire's money...

495
01:01:17,288 --> 01:01:19,756
...will be looted by us in
seven days, in Kakori...

496
01:01:20,858 --> 01:01:22,758
And we will buy bombs with that money.

497
01:01:23,027 --> 01:01:26,827
<i>Now paint the whole town with it.
Paint your very being.</i>

498
01:01:27,464 --> 01:01:31,423
<i>Paint your every vein with it.
Paint it with a smile.</i>

499
01:01:32,136 --> 01:01:36,095
<i>Paint those childhood years, won't you.
Paint the flush of youth.</i>

500
01:01:36,807 --> 01:01:41,267
<i>Don't hesitate, my friend.
Paint your patriotism over everything.</i>

501
01:01:41,478 --> 01:01:45,778
<i>Watch as it brings out the
colour of patriotism, my friend.</i>

502
01:01:46,483 --> 01:01:50,783
<i>Take some soil of my land,
the scent of this air.</i>

503
01:01:51,155 --> 01:01:59,756
<i>Take some soil of my land,
the scent of this air.</i>

504
01:01:59,863 --> 01:02:04,596
<i>Add the breath of my being,
the throbbing of my heart.</i>

505
01:02:05,002 --> 01:02:10,463
<i>And the zeal,
that races through my blood.</i>

506
01:02:11,008 --> 01:02:15,308
<i>Take all these and stir it.
Then watch as it brings out the colour.</i>

507
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:20,139
<i>Watch as it brings out the
colour of patriotism, my friend.</i>

508
01:02:22,686 --> 01:02:35,497
<i>Watch as it brings out the colour.</i>

509
01:03:09,566 --> 01:03:17,200
<i>Watch as it brings out the
colour of patriotism, my friend.</i>

510
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:50,939
British Officers...
around 20 to 25 of them.

511
01:03:51,809 --> 01:03:55,108
We have to call it off! We've nearly
reached Kakori. Stop Ashfaq, quick.

512
01:04:03,987 --> 01:04:04,954
Ashfaq, stop!

513
01:04:07,991 --> 01:04:09,788
It's too late to back out now...
Come on... Move!

514
01:04:27,344 --> 01:04:27,969
Get inside!

515
01:04:42,326 --> 01:04:44,055
Keep the windows shut...

516
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:47,155
Come on!

517
01:04:48,365 --> 01:04:48,831
The keys!

518
01:04:49,366 --> 01:04:50,663
You won't get away with this.

519
01:04:51,101 --> 01:04:53,661
<i>Give me the keys!
- I don't have it.</i>

520
01:04:54,204 --> 01:04:55,671
Banwari get the sledge hammer.

521
01:05:00,110 --> 01:05:01,839
I'll handle them.
You go get the money...

522
01:07:21,018 --> 01:07:23,486
I've committed my life
to the freedom of this country.

523
01:07:24,855 --> 01:07:29,155
Comfort, and other worldly
desires do not attract me.

524
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:34,160
I know you want me to
get married and settle down...

525
01:07:34,531 --> 01:07:36,658
...like all parents do.

526
01:07:37,034 --> 01:07:39,002
But freedom is my bride.

527
01:07:41,038 --> 01:07:46,499
I hope you'll forgive me.
Your most obedient son, Bhagat.

528
01:07:52,883 --> 01:07:53,508
Let's take a break.

529
01:07:58,555 --> 01:08:01,854
Breakfast?
No...

530
01:08:22,245 --> 01:08:22,870
Put it there.

531
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:28,211
General Dyer? How can one even think
of doing something like this?

532
01:08:31,088 --> 01:08:35,548
I can't believe that he actually killed more
than 400 people at Jallianwala Baugh.

533
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:38,057
379... that was the official figure.

534
01:08:38,762 --> 01:08:41,060
Actually nearly 1000
people were butchered...

535
01:08:48,772 --> 01:08:54,574
Last year at the tomb of Peer Sai,
I prayed for Daljeet's well being.

536
01:08:55,112 --> 01:08:56,238
Who's Daljeet?

537
01:08:56,446 --> 01:08:58,573
We were the epitome of tolerance.

538
01:08:59,783 --> 01:09:04,584
Even an ant reacts. But we are conditioned
to take everything lying down.

539
01:09:05,355 --> 01:09:08,085
Rubbish! It's today's generation
which lacks the will to do anything

540
01:09:08,291 --> 01:09:09,918
Have you ever heard of
Shaheed Uddham Singh?

541
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:14,089
He went all the way to London
and killed that Dyer.

542
01:09:14,631 --> 01:09:17,600
...because he was also a part
of the Jallianwala Baugh massacre.

543
01:09:18,135 --> 01:09:21,764
Eat it Sonia.
The butter will strengthen your bones.

544
01:09:22,139 --> 01:09:26,098
In Punjab every mother sends
at least one son to the army.

545
01:09:26,309 --> 01:09:29,278
Why should we retreat?
Sacrifice runs in our blood.

546
01:09:29,479 --> 01:09:32,277
Only idiots like DJ retreat.

547
01:09:32,482 --> 01:09:34,109
Why does it always come back to me?

548
01:09:34,317 --> 01:09:37,115
Shut up and eat your paratha.

549
01:09:37,387 --> 01:09:39,947
What is the most used word in this country?
ADJUST!

550
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:44,950
Six people sitting on a seat forfour... someone
will squeeze in and say - 'Please adjust! '.

551
01:09:48,832 --> 01:09:55,965
Hey! Why are you adjusting?

552
01:09:59,843 --> 01:10:01,140
Strange. Isn't it?

553
01:10:03,013 --> 01:10:08,474
We are being hunted like
animals in our own country...

554
01:10:11,354 --> 01:10:14,152
...Ashfaq you should cross the border
and get to Afghanistan...

555
01:10:15,192 --> 01:10:18,650
...We have many Muslim friends there.
You will be safe with them.

556
01:10:19,196 --> 01:10:20,663
After all, you're one of their own.

557
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:22,995
One of their own?
Hmm...

558
01:10:23,867 --> 01:10:24,993
Why don't you think of me
as one of your own?

559
01:10:29,206 --> 01:10:30,332
Ashfaq... I never meant...

560
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:33,000
...Ashfaq...

561
01:10:36,546 --> 01:10:38,673
I didn't mean to hurt you.

562
01:10:40,217 --> 01:10:42,685
This is your country as much as it is mine.

563
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:47,520
You have a right to fight and die for it too...

564
01:10:49,593 --> 01:10:50,855
...Forgive me.

565
01:10:51,061 --> 01:10:52,688
Ram, let us not talk of dying...

566
01:10:53,063 --> 01:10:58,365
I pray, that we all live to see
our grandchildren grow up in a free country.

567
01:11:02,906 --> 01:11:04,032
Ram run!

568
01:12:19,649 --> 01:12:21,446
Where are your other friends?

569
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:23,786
Where's Azad?

570
01:13:13,203 --> 01:13:13,999
Banwari!

571
01:14:27,243 --> 01:14:29,575
I loved those songs and dances.
Do they happen in yourfilms?

572
01:14:29,946 --> 01:14:33,473
That's the reason we grow trees
in this country... to dance around them.

573
01:14:38,588 --> 01:14:41,056
So where are we going?

574
01:14:43,927 --> 01:14:46,555
<i>Special day, special place!
Special DAY?</i>

575
01:16:02,338 --> 01:16:06,297
Ever since I was a kid
I used to come here...

576
01:16:07,544 --> 01:16:12,311
...to watch planes take off... and watch them
till they don't disappear in the sky.

577
01:16:16,519 --> 01:16:18,487
What the hell are they doing?

578
01:16:45,048 --> 01:16:46,310
I don't believe them.

579
01:16:46,449 --> 01:16:47,006
Men!

580
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:49,848
Come on, face it,
you'd love to do that really.

581
01:16:50,019 --> 01:16:52,317
What? Take my shirt off
and howl at planes.

582
01:16:52,555 --> 01:16:54,352
I won't mind if you do.

583
01:16:54,891 --> 01:16:56,518
Dream on buddy...

584
01:17:04,067 --> 01:17:08,367
Boys and girls
and Sukhi...

585
01:17:08,571 --> 01:17:09,697
Why me all the time?

586
01:17:09,939 --> 01:17:11,372
I want to make a special announcement...

587
01:17:12,909 --> 01:17:16,868
I was wondering if you'd like
to spend the rest of your life with me...

588
01:17:17,747 --> 01:17:21,706
...that's in case you aren't
doing anything important...

589
01:17:25,822 --> 01:17:27,380
Will you please marry me?

590
01:18:15,861 --> 01:18:23,103
<i>Without saying a word,
you steal my heart.</i>

591
01:18:30,859 --> 01:18:45,672
<i>I'll find happiness by your side
I can't stay apart</i>

592
01:18:48,043 --> 01:19:18,569
<i>My life tastes sweet now,
since you walked through that door.</i>

593
01:19:19,007 --> 01:19:33,877
<i>When your arms wrap around me,
I know I've found my shore.</i>

594
01:19:36,091 --> 01:19:50,062
<i>Without saying a word,
you steal my heart.</i>

595
01:20:19,668 --> 01:20:33,776
<i>Sweep through the streets of my mind
like a gentle spring.</i>

596
01:20:35,650 --> 01:20:49,394
<i>Walk through the corridors of my heart,
fill the caravan of my dreams.</i>

597
01:20:50,532 --> 01:21:05,880
<i>I sway to the song
of your soul.</i>

598
01:21:07,716 --> 01:21:22,154
<i>Without saying a word,
you steal my heart.</i>

599
01:21:22,697 --> 01:21:37,840
<i>I'll find happiness by your side,
I can't stay apart.</i>

600
01:22:02,904 --> 01:22:04,929
I'll come back later.

601
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:10,373
My prayers won't stop till
my country gets its freedom.

602
01:22:12,414 --> 01:22:14,939
I don't think you can wait till then.

603
01:22:16,418 --> 01:22:21,481
My name is James McKinley. I'm here
to find out from you...

604
01:22:22,257 --> 01:22:25,886
...where Azad and
the otherterrorists are hiding.

605
01:22:26,094 --> 01:22:33,159
Not terrorists.
Revolutionaries.

606
01:23:58,453 --> 01:24:05,484
On this day, we walk with death
and laugh at its pale spectre.

607
01:24:06,895 --> 01:24:15,496
Death cannot take you Ashfaq,
when you live in people's hearts and minds.

608
01:24:30,552 --> 01:24:33,282
This is the Holy Quran.

609
01:24:34,889 --> 01:24:39,519
Hindus like Bismil will create
a country forthemselves.

610
01:24:39,728 --> 01:24:42,196
What will a Muslim like you get
out of it? They're just using you.

611
01:24:43,565 --> 01:24:47,092
He's not fighting for Hindu freedom,
he's fighting for Hindustan's freedom.

612
01:24:48,570 --> 01:24:51,368
But you won't be
able to understand this.

613
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:55,698
You've been a slave so
long you've begun to like it.

614
01:25:00,915 --> 01:25:03,645
Tell us where Azad
and the otherterrorists are...

615
01:25:05,086 --> 01:25:07,782
...You can still
save yourself.

616
01:25:17,265 --> 01:25:18,562
19 December.

617
01:25:19,267 --> 01:25:21,667
It's not yourfault...

618
01:25:22,437 --> 01:25:24,905
...you're only doing your duty.

619
01:27:25,727 --> 01:27:26,921
Whats wrong?
Did someone die?

620
01:27:29,230 --> 01:27:33,132
Sue... I haven't seen
these guys so serious.

621
01:27:34,068 --> 01:27:35,797
What are you doing
to my friends?

622
01:27:36,404 --> 01:27:41,364
It's not me... it's them.
They've really begun to get into this.

623
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:44,605
Hey Laxman, aren't
you coming along?

624
01:27:45,079 --> 01:27:46,376
No. Some othertime.

625
01:27:46,581 --> 01:27:48,048
Come on. It's my
last night in town.

626
01:27:49,083 --> 01:27:50,550
I'm not really hungry.

627
01:27:50,752 --> 01:27:53,880
Watch us eat then.
Come on.

628
01:27:55,757 --> 01:27:57,554
Come on...

629
01:28:10,104 --> 01:28:18,739
To two lovebirds with the most insanely
romantic engagement in the whole wide world...

630
01:28:25,453 --> 01:28:27,853
I'm insane only about
two things in my life.

631
01:28:28,122 --> 01:28:31,319
Sonia and flying.

632
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:44,101
You're lucky to feel so
passionately about something.

633
01:28:44,806 --> 01:28:46,433
You have your
poetry Aslam.

634
01:28:47,141 --> 01:28:48,938
Just like DJ has his singing.

635
01:28:49,811 --> 01:28:52,439
Everyone has passion for something inside
them, they just have to find this 'thing'.

636
01:28:52,981 --> 01:28:54,608
Just like our
revolutionaries...

637
01:28:54,816 --> 01:28:58,274
...their passion forfreedom was greater
than their love fortheir own lives.

638
01:28:58,486 --> 01:29:03,685
There's nothing in this world
worth giving your life for. Nothing!

639
01:29:08,329 --> 01:29:09,887
Repeat.

640
01:29:10,098 --> 01:29:11,122
Easy DJ...

641
01:29:11,332 --> 01:29:12,697
Yes mama.

642
01:29:14,502 --> 01:29:16,470
There are things worth
giving your life for Karan.

643
01:29:16,671 --> 01:29:18,138
Please.

644
01:29:18,506 --> 01:29:21,304
Like what? Look at Bhagat Singh and
Azad and the rest of those guys.

645
01:29:21,509 --> 01:29:23,477
They gave their lives
forthis country.

646
01:29:23,845 --> 01:29:26,245
Look what happened.
All for nothing.

647
01:29:27,181 --> 01:29:30,981
It's a shit-hole today.

648
01:29:32,854 --> 01:29:33,821
I give a shit.

649
01:29:34,355 --> 01:29:38,155
People like Ajay who fight for
their country give a shit.

650
01:29:38,359 --> 01:29:40,725
So that people like you
can sleep peacefully.

651
01:29:42,530 --> 01:29:45,158
Sonia get real.

652
01:29:45,366 --> 01:29:46,333
Sonia's right.

653
01:29:46,534 --> 01:29:50,493
Sue, it's all-fine for a
foreigner like you to say all this...

654
01:29:50,705 --> 01:29:54,163
Out here we're
fighting for basics.

655
01:29:54,375 --> 01:29:57,173
...food, clothing
and shelter.

656
01:29:57,378 --> 01:30:01,007
Out here you try to change things
you'll get even more screwed.

657
01:30:01,549 --> 01:30:04,177
Corruption is in our DNA.

658
01:30:05,553 --> 01:30:07,180
There is no future
forthis country.

659
01:30:07,388 --> 01:30:11,757
She's talking about the past,
you're thinking about the future...

660
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:14,358
One leg in the past and
one leg in the future,

661
01:30:14,562 --> 01:30:16,189
that's why we're pissing
on the present...

662
01:30:18,733 --> 01:30:20,291
For once in
life get serious.

663
01:30:24,906 --> 01:30:29,707
Karan, it's easy to sit on
the outside and be a critic...

664
01:30:30,912 --> 01:30:32,971
...blaming others is
even easier.

665
01:30:34,749 --> 01:30:38,207
Why don't you go out
there and change things?

666
01:30:38,419 --> 01:30:39,386
Take a stand.

667
01:30:40,421 --> 01:30:44,551
Join politics, the police force,
government and clean it up.

668
01:30:45,593 --> 01:30:47,993
But you won't!
I'll tell you why...

669
01:30:49,263 --> 01:30:58,228
Because that takes hard work.
It's easierto crib.

670
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:00,666
Nothing's going to change.

671
01:31:01,209 --> 01:31:05,339
You can go to your grave trying...
it won't make any difference.

672
01:31:05,546 --> 01:31:10,506
Correct... the only difference
will be how you go to your grave...

673
01:31:14,789 --> 01:31:19,920
I'm not drunk. Am
I drunk Sue?

674
01:31:22,463 --> 01:31:26,365
See, the director's word
is final. Cut it!

675
01:31:29,303 --> 01:31:32,272
Where were we?

676
01:31:37,912 --> 01:31:40,904
On the way to our graves.

677
01:31:41,716 --> 01:31:45,152
We'll all be wrapped in
white shrouds when we die.

678
01:31:46,254 --> 01:31:49,246
Only Ajay will be wrapped
in the national flag.

679
01:31:51,025 --> 01:31:54,085
Karan, you can say
whateveryou want,

680
01:31:54,829 --> 01:31:57,855
not even the street dogs
will bark when we die.

681
01:31:59,634 --> 01:32:05,436
But Ajay will get
a 21 gun salute.

682
01:32:43,611 --> 01:32:45,670
Karan, this is foryou.

683
01:32:45,913 --> 01:32:47,540
For me?
Thanks dude.

684
01:32:48,149 --> 01:32:50,049
The girls fall for him anyway...

685
01:32:50,251 --> 01:32:51,343
If anyone deserves
the jacket, it's me.

686
01:32:51,552 --> 01:32:56,489
Wow! What a dutiful
daughter-in-law.

687
01:32:56,857 --> 01:32:59,621
Come on, touch your
fiance's feet.

688
01:33:00,728 --> 01:33:02,958
DJ's right.
Touch my feet, madam.

689
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:09,863
See what women in this
country have to put up with?

690
01:33:10,071 --> 01:33:14,007
I think DJ's right. You should
respect yourtraditions.

691
01:33:14,208 --> 01:33:15,470
See, even Sue agrees...

692
01:33:15,710 --> 01:33:19,202
...a woman's place is at
her husband's feet.

693
01:33:27,655 --> 01:33:29,247
These two can
be such children.

694
01:33:29,457 --> 01:33:32,790
They spend half theirtime fighting.
The other half making up.

695
01:33:33,494 --> 01:33:36,190
Sweetie-pie, can't you
stay a while longer?

696
01:33:36,764 --> 01:33:40,131
No, I have to go...

697
01:33:40,468 --> 01:33:41,901
SWEETIE -PIE!

698
01:33:45,906 --> 01:33:46,998
Shut up guys.

699
01:33:52,113 --> 01:33:53,671
Shut up yaar...
Ma will hear everything.

700
01:33:56,317 --> 01:33:59,309
I know how Sonia must
be feeling right now...

701
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,010
...my father was also
in the army.

702
01:34:01,489 --> 01:34:03,650
I used to think that way too...

703
01:34:04,558 --> 01:34:07,083
...when Ajay's father and
I first got married.

704
01:34:07,828 --> 01:34:11,025
But then you realize something about
being an Air-force pilot's wife.

705
01:34:11,465 --> 01:34:16,300
You realize that your husband has
pledged his life forthe country.

706
01:34:17,705 --> 01:34:23,405
The least you can do for him, is control
your emotions. Not be weak.

707
01:34:31,319 --> 01:34:36,985
I'm so happy Ajay's
chosen a girl like you...

708
01:34:37,191 --> 01:34:39,022
...now I can die in peace.

709
01:34:39,226 --> 01:34:39,851
Don't talk nonsense Ma.

710
01:34:40,061 --> 01:34:44,464
You'll have many more years...
...and a dozen grandchildren too.

711
01:34:44,732 --> 01:34:47,360
Grandchildren? First you've got to stay
home long enough to make them, dude.

712
01:35:17,798 --> 01:35:22,792
<i>The bugle sounds, the enemy wakes.
The battle is upon us.</i>

713
01:35:25,206 --> 01:35:30,166
<i>And in our hearts, we feel the swell,
of pride and steel and valour.</i>

714
01:35:32,546 --> 01:35:37,483
<i>For we will play the game of blood,
if dark clouds shroud our land.</i>

715
01:35:39,854 --> 01:35:45,190
<i>Because this day, we walk with death,
and laugh at its pale spectre.</i>

716
01:35:51,232 --> 01:35:55,760
<i>We will not fear those cruel swords,
our courage is far sharper.</i>

717
01:35:57,371 --> 01:36:02,365
<i>We will not lower, in the face of threats,
a head raised to its mother.</i>

718
01:36:05,913 --> 01:36:10,782
<i>We will not fear those cruel swords,
our courage is far sharper.</i>

719
01:36:13,287 --> 01:36:17,815
<i>We will not lower, in the face of threats,
a head raised to its mother.</i>

720
01:36:20,528 --> 01:36:25,761
<i>For let them know, their cowardly deeds,
just serve to stoke our fires.</i>

721
01:36:27,868 --> 01:36:32,999
<i>Because this day, we walk with death,
and laugh at its pale spectre.</i>

722
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:41,072
<i>We bade farewell, to this day,
knowing it could be our last.</i>

723
01:36:41,549 --> 01:36:46,043
<i>We swore to play, with our lives,
never waver in our task.</i>

724
01:36:46,353 --> 01:36:51,017
<i>For we are but the last, few guests,
served at fate's great banquet.</i>

725
01:36:51,292 --> 01:36:58,425
<i>We cannot quell, the raging storm,
the spirit of revolution.</i>

726
01:36:58,632 --> 01:37:00,930
<i>For it now courses in our veins,
like lava truly molten.</i>

727
01:37:01,302 --> 01:37:05,932
<i>We will teach them, the twin lessons,
of fear and fortitude.</i>

728
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:10,600
<i>Our goal cannot now hide for long,
when courage is our beacon.</i>

729
01:37:10,811 --> 01:37:15,612
<i>Because this day, we walk with death,
and laugh at its pale spectre.</i>

730
01:37:40,307 --> 01:37:42,775
We have to take drastic measures.

731
01:37:43,811 --> 01:37:44,607
What drastic measures?

732
01:37:47,781 --> 01:37:48,805
Kill him.

733
01:38:11,972 --> 01:38:12,597
Com'on.

734
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,299
Bhagat run! Quick!

735
01:38:43,571 --> 01:38:45,766
You! Get going.

736
01:39:00,421 --> 01:39:02,889
Bang! Bang! Bang!

737
01:39:14,702 --> 01:39:20,004
Inquilab Zindabad -
"Long live the revolution".

738
01:39:20,374 --> 01:39:24,367
Two words that became the slogan
forthe Indian freedom movement.

739
01:39:30,050 --> 01:39:31,813
Great idea!

740
01:39:32,152 --> 01:39:34,211
But Bhagat, escaping
will be impossible.

741
01:39:34,421 --> 01:39:35,410
Our main mission is
to get caught...

742
01:39:36,256 --> 01:39:38,588
...not escape.

743
01:39:38,792 --> 01:39:39,349
What?

744
01:39:40,427 --> 01:39:43,555
If we get caught there
will be a trial...

745
01:39:44,298 --> 01:39:45,959
...we'll get a chance
to speak.

746
01:39:46,834 --> 01:39:47,823
We'll be heard.

747
01:39:54,441 --> 01:39:58,172
But if they catch us,
they'll hang us for certain.

748
01:39:58,579 --> 01:39:59,238
I know.

749
01:40:01,682 --> 01:40:05,118
But it takes a loud noise
to open deaf ears.

750
01:40:12,226 --> 01:40:15,059
LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION!

751
01:40:17,965 --> 01:40:19,796
DOWN WITH IMPERIALISM!

752
01:40:33,414 --> 01:40:35,473
KHALBALLI

753
01:40:35,916 --> 01:40:42,822
<i>Feel the unrest sweep
through the land</i>

754
01:40:43,424 --> 01:40:47,884
<i>Feel the unrest.
Feel the unrest.</i>

755
01:40:48,328 --> 01:41:02,504
<i>There is an unrest sweeping
through the land.</i>

756
01:41:03,110 --> 01:41:05,340
<i>The embers, they are burning.</i>

757
01:41:05,546 --> 01:41:10,347
<i>The tide, it's turning.
You can feel the winds of change</i>

758
01:41:10,551 --> 01:41:12,519
<i>Feel the unrest sweep through the land
Feel the unrest</i>

759
01:41:23,630 --> 01:41:25,029
We are political prisoners...

760
01:41:26,667 --> 01:41:29,727
...we should be allowed books...
...writing material...

761
01:41:30,137 --> 01:41:33,129
...and at least one
daily newspaper.

762
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:36,605
We will not eat till then.
The hunger strike will continue.

763
01:42:09,376 --> 01:42:14,746
<i>Our words won't falter now,
We will speak our mind.</i>

764
01:42:17,017 --> 01:42:22,216
<i>We won't back down now.
Our dreams we won't leave behind.</i>

765
01:42:22,823 --> 01:42:30,992
<i>We won't let the storm die.
Injustice we will defy.</i>

766
01:42:39,439 --> 01:42:48,609
<i>You can feel it possess you now.
Feel it, your soul, claim.</i>

767
01:42:49,383 --> 01:42:53,615
<i>Drink this spirit in one long swallow.
Feel it course through your veins</i>

768
01:42:54,221 --> 01:42:58,624
<i>Let the celebrations begin now.
Feel your body sway.</i>

769
01:42:59,193 --> 01:43:03,630
<i>In every breath feel more alive.
To keep the storm at bay</i>

770
01:43:04,631 --> 01:43:09,295
<i>See the unrest in those eyes.
See it all around.</i>

771
01:43:09,503 --> 01:43:13,963
<i>See it in the air, my friend.
And in those hearts, abound.</i>

772
01:43:14,441 --> 01:43:21,313
<i>Feel the unrest sweep
through the land</i>

773
01:43:21,515 --> 01:43:23,983
<i>Feel the unrest
Feel the unrest</i>

774
01:43:34,428 --> 01:43:38,626
<i>The winds of change are blowing now
The tide it is, a turning.</i>

775
01:43:38,832 --> 01:43:43,826
<i>The moment of truth is upon us now
It's time to do or die.</i>

776
01:43:44,037 --> 01:43:53,469
<i>We are engulfed in the shadows
But we will come out brighter.</i>

777
01:43:54,281 --> 01:44:03,553
<i>Feel the unrest.
Feel the unrest.</i>

778
01:44:20,641 --> 01:44:22,199
<i>Pretty nice huh?
Very pretty.</i>

779
01:44:25,412 --> 01:44:28,006
In breaking news today...

780
01:44:28,448 --> 01:44:32,748
...a MIG-21 fighter plane
has just crashed...

781
01:44:33,053 --> 01:44:36,113
...this is the second such crash
in the past six months...

782
01:44:36,390 --> 01:44:39,917
The Defence Ministry has ordered
an investigation into the crash.

783
01:44:40,294 --> 01:44:43,320
We have just received
news that the pilot...

784
01:44:43,563 --> 01:44:47,294
...Flight Lieutenant Ajay Rathod
has died in the crash.

785
01:44:48,869 --> 01:44:52,270
Flight Lt Rathod apparently did not
eject from the burning plane...

786
01:44:52,472 --> 01:44:58,502
Instead he steered it away from Ambala
city and crashed it in an open field.

787
01:44:58,712 --> 01:44:59,872
Thus saving many lives

788
01:45:00,881 --> 01:45:02,246
Viewers may recall...

789
01:45:02,449 --> 01:45:06,545
...that until now,
163 MiG-21 of IAF have crashed...

790
01:45:06,753 --> 01:45:10,712
...and 66 pilots have
lost their lives.

791
01:46:26,366 --> 01:46:34,796
<i>This game of hide and seek has gone on too long,
come home now, won't you.</i>

792
01:46:35,709 --> 01:46:39,668
<i>I've searched high and low,</i>

793
01:46:40,247 --> 01:46:46,516
<i>these old eyes are weary so,
come home now won't you.</i>

794
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:58,029
<i>Dusk is spreading like the ache in my heart,
my vision blurs, come home now won't you.</i>

795
01:46:59,433 --> 01:47:07,363
<i>I'm in a place you wouldn't
believe Ma.</i>

796
01:47:08,642 --> 01:47:16,879
<i>Endless skies
I can soar.</i>

797
01:47:17,918 --> 01:47:26,553
<i>Just like your fairy tales,
it's filled with dreams.</i>

798
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:34,360
<i>A sea of hope with no shore.</i>

799
01:47:35,735 --> 01:47:43,574
<i>My soul flies here, like a kite without fear.
No one to cut my strings, no more.</i>

800
01:47:43,944 --> 01:47:49,576
Flt. Lt. Ajay Rathod stayed in
the plane until the very end...

801
01:47:49,916 --> 01:47:54,080
...and steered the plane
clear of Ambala city.

802
01:47:54,287 --> 01:48:01,455
Thereby saving
many lives.

803
01:48:03,763 --> 01:48:08,200
In the last 10 years over 100 MIG-21
aircrafts of the IAF have crashed...

804
01:48:08,401 --> 01:48:12,235
...in which over 30 pilots have
lost their lives.

805
01:48:20,147 --> 01:48:23,150
Isn't this a case of
high-level corruption?

806
01:48:23,150 --> 01:48:28,747
Not at all. I've personally clarified
the issue in parliament.

807
01:48:29,222 --> 01:48:30,883
This is a downright lie.

808
01:48:31,291 --> 01:48:34,226
The youngsters of today are brash and
irresponsible when it comes to flying planes.

809
01:48:34,427 --> 01:48:36,452
No! I don't agree...

810
01:48:36,930 --> 01:48:39,398
Flt. Lt. Ajay Rathod
was an ace pilot...

811
01:48:39,599 --> 01:48:41,294
...who I trained...

812
01:48:41,701 --> 01:48:45,660
He was a gold medallist.
The youngest to clear night sorties.

813
01:48:45,872 --> 01:48:48,432
With over 1000 flying hours...

814
01:48:48,875 --> 01:48:51,742
This can't be the record
of an irresponsible pilot.

815
01:48:52,012 --> 01:48:57,712
Defence Minister, how many
more pilots will you send to their graves...

816
01:48:57,918 --> 01:49:05,620
...before you stop the
rot in the system?

817
01:49:06,059 --> 01:49:15,092
<i>If only I could show
you this place, Ma.</i>

818
01:49:15,368 --> 01:49:24,333
<i>Here waterfalls are
made of rainbows.</i>

819
01:49:24,544 --> 01:49:28,480
<i>There are no roses
just bouquets of dreams Ma.</i>

820
01:49:29,316 --> 01:49:33,776
<i>Their scent, no flower
can hope for.</i>

821
01:49:33,987 --> 01:49:37,980
<i>Here sunlight and shadow
walk hand in hand.</i>

822
01:49:38,458 --> 01:49:42,087
<i>Everything seems
bright and new.</i>

823
01:49:43,096 --> 01:49:47,499
<i>But what is heaven,
and all its wonders,</i>

824
01:49:47,701 --> 01:49:52,900
<i>when Ma, I don't have you.</i>

825
01:49:53,106 --> 01:49:55,574
From now on, the government
will make sure that...

826
01:49:56,476 --> 01:50:01,436
...only experienced pilots are given
access to these machines...

827
01:50:02,048 --> 01:50:08,248
...and not to rash pilots
like Ajay Rathod.

828
01:50:08,521 --> 01:50:10,489
What the hell is
he talking about!

829
01:50:10,690 --> 01:50:14,820
I welcome any investigation.
I have nothing to hide.

830
01:50:19,132 --> 01:50:23,296
This damn MIG investigation
shouldn't take us down.

831
01:50:23,937 --> 01:50:29,603
Relax Sir. Public memory is short.
Besides, we'll handle things.

832
01:50:31,244 --> 01:50:35,840
Dead pilots, live very
long in the news.

833
01:50:37,117 --> 01:50:40,052
But then, they join the forces to
sacrifice their lives. Don't they?

834
01:51:48,822 --> 01:51:51,188
The situation is tense
at the moment.

835
01:51:51,458 --> 01:51:54,052
There is growing anger
and discontent.

836
01:51:54,260 --> 01:51:58,253
Directed largely towards the government.
Especially the Defence Minister.

837
01:51:58,465 --> 01:52:00,433
We have with us
Ajay Rathod's mother...

838
01:52:04,571 --> 01:52:06,766
The government can't wash its
hands off the issue like this.

839
01:52:07,607 --> 01:52:09,973
They are answerable
to the public.

840
01:52:10,744 --> 01:52:16,273
If the MIG spare parts were of doubtful quality,
why were they bought in the first place?

841
01:52:16,649 --> 01:52:26,524
For what? Money?
Money won't bring our children back.

842
01:52:29,496 --> 01:52:33,865
The Defence Minister
is morally responsible.

843
01:52:34,367 --> 01:52:36,028
He has to resign.

844
01:52:36,336 --> 01:52:39,965
It looks like the veil has been
pulled off the defence scam.

845
01:52:40,173 --> 01:52:43,336
But how much
will be revealed?

846
01:52:43,543 --> 01:52:46,637
Mishra,
what's happening?

847
01:53:03,797 --> 01:53:06,630
Ajay Rathod was
not a novice...

848
01:53:06,833 --> 01:53:10,234
...he didn't let his plane
crash into the town.

849
01:53:10,937 --> 01:53:17,501
When it developed a snag
he didn't try to save his life.

850
01:53:18,311 --> 01:53:24,307
He steered it clear of Ambala
...saving thousands of civilians.

851
01:53:24,517 --> 01:53:31,320
Yet the Defence Minister
calls him rash.

852
01:53:50,009 --> 01:53:53,035
I'm not moving...
this is for Ajay.

853
01:53:54,647 --> 01:53:56,376
This could turn ugly, Aunty.

854
01:53:57,050 --> 01:53:57,846
Let it.

855
01:54:22,475 --> 01:54:25,638
<i>Our blood is ranging.
It's flowing through the streets.</i>

856
01:54:25,912 --> 01:54:28,779
But it won't go in vain

857
01:54:30,383 --> 01:54:37,312
<i>Our eyes are blood shot for a purpose.
A cause we will attain.</i>

858
01:54:38,558 --> 01:54:45,327
<i>It fell from our bodies,
embraced the earth.</i>

859
01:54:46,165 --> 01:54:49,157
<i>Went winding through streets.
A river of courage</i>

860
01:54:49,435 --> 01:54:54,998
<i>...it surged and swept.</i>

861
01:54:55,909 --> 01:55:05,011
<i>It flowed to make a new
beginning</i>

862
01:55:18,064 --> 01:55:25,163
<i>From gaping wounds,
and gashes large,</i>

863
01:55:26,072 --> 01:55:33,069
<i>it oozed, slowly and steadily.</i>

864
01:55:33,546 --> 01:55:41,112
<i>While the pointing fingers,
got fists in reply,</i>

865
01:55:41,754 --> 01:55:45,315
<i>yet, our blood was raging.</i>

866
01:55:45,758 --> 01:55:50,718
<i>It flowed not in vain
but with a reason.</i>

867
01:55:51,364 --> 01:55:57,735
<i>A cause we will attain.</i>

868
01:55:59,072 --> 01:56:03,236
<i>Our eyes are blood shot
for a reason.</i>

869
01:56:03,443 --> 01:56:06,241
<i>A cause we will attain.</i>

870
01:56:07,213 --> 01:56:17,851
<i>Our blood is raging.
It's flowing through the streets.</i>

871
01:56:18,057 --> 01:56:23,427
<i>...it surged and swept.</i>

872
01:56:24,631 --> 01:56:28,089
<i>It flowed to make a new
beginning</i>

873
01:56:28,301 --> 01:56:34,604
<i>Yet, our blood was raging.</i>

874
01:56:35,074 --> 01:56:42,412
<i>Yet, our blood was raging.</i>

875
01:56:42,982 --> 01:57:03,166
<i>Yet, our blood was raging.</i>

876
01:57:14,414 --> 01:57:17,440
Someone get a doctor! Quick!
We'll take it from here.

877
01:57:44,310 --> 01:57:46,938
They were beating up
innocent people...

878
01:57:48,715 --> 01:57:51,013
Why didn't you
stop them?

879
01:57:51,384 --> 01:57:53,511
You protested against
the government, our own party...

880
01:57:53,720 --> 01:57:54,550
That's unacceptable.

881
01:57:55,455 --> 01:57:57,548
The protest was not
against the government...

882
01:57:58,057 --> 01:57:59,752
...it was forthe truth.

883
01:58:01,728 --> 01:58:03,753
So many pilots have died...

884
01:58:03,963 --> 01:58:06,989
...young innocent boys who were fighting
for our country... killed...

885
01:58:07,233 --> 01:58:12,193
...so that someone in the
government could make money.

886
01:58:12,905 --> 01:58:15,203
And our party office doesn't
do a thing about it.

887
01:58:16,209 --> 01:58:16,937
Come... Sit down.

888
01:58:22,415 --> 01:58:23,177
Have some tea.

889
01:58:29,922 --> 01:58:36,384
Laxman, in politics there's
no place for emotions.

890
01:58:37,263 --> 01:58:39,424
We have big plans foryou.

891
01:58:40,566 --> 01:58:41,396
Big plans.

892
01:58:41,601 --> 01:58:46,971
Only dogs salivate when
you show them bone Mishraji.

893
01:59:18,971 --> 01:59:19,995
How's Aunty?

894
01:59:20,406 --> 01:59:21,532
They're doing an MRI.

895
01:59:40,993 --> 01:59:43,427
She's slipped into a coma.

896
01:59:43,830 --> 01:59:49,097
Severe skull damage,
coupled with the shock of her son's death.

897
01:59:50,002 --> 01:59:54,496
That's an ugly gash.
You need attention.

898
01:59:58,678 --> 02:00:00,873
Aslam... How's he?

899
02:00:05,518 --> 02:00:07,383
What have you come for?
Haven't you done enough damage?

900
02:00:12,024 --> 02:00:14,356
Uncle, it isn't
what you think.

901
02:00:14,827 --> 02:00:19,764
I'm not interested in what you think,
In what you want to do...

902
02:00:21,701 --> 02:00:23,498
I'm just going to say this once.

903
02:00:24,170 --> 02:00:26,502
Aslam doesn't
know what's good for him.

904
02:00:27,173 --> 02:00:29,573
He's an emotional boy, always has been.
He listens to his heart, not his head.

905
02:00:31,811 --> 02:00:34,245
These are bad times,
for people like us.

906
02:00:35,214 --> 02:00:39,014
Don't take him
down with you.

907
02:00:40,953 --> 02:00:41,681
He's inside.

908
02:00:41,888 --> 02:00:42,946
Go on...

909
02:01:03,075 --> 02:01:05,009
All parts working?

910
02:01:06,846 --> 02:01:09,815
Don't make me laugh, idiot.
It hurts

911
02:01:11,017 --> 02:01:12,075
How's Aunty?

912
02:01:13,352 --> 02:01:14,376
She's in a coma.

913
02:01:18,090 --> 02:01:19,819
How can this be
happening to us?

914
02:01:32,838 --> 02:01:33,998
Some dinner?

915
02:01:34,507 --> 02:01:36,702
No, don't worry Aunty.

916
02:01:37,677 --> 02:01:41,135
We just came to see Aslam.
We've got to get back to the hospital.

917
02:01:41,881 --> 02:01:42,848
Take care.

918
02:02:07,573 --> 02:02:09,006
Listen... I...

919
02:02:12,378 --> 02:02:17,281
...I'm sorry.

920
02:03:19,712 --> 02:03:20,770
Please eat.

921
02:03:44,036 --> 02:03:45,663
Everything's falling apart...

922
02:03:48,474 --> 02:03:50,339
...and all I can do is
stand and watch.

923
02:03:57,583 --> 02:03:59,710
People like us don't count
out here.

924
02:04:05,157 --> 02:04:13,622
This system is so messed up, a hundred more
Ajay's can die and nothing will change.

925
02:04:43,696 --> 02:04:47,188
Ajay did everything right,
all his life...

926
02:04:51,203 --> 02:04:58,268
...he was a good pilot,
a good friend, a good son...

927
02:04:59,111 --> 02:05:01,409
...he never harmed a soul.

928
02:05:02,982 --> 02:05:09,512
...he didn't deserve this...

929
02:05:11,323 --> 02:05:13,382
...Sonia didn't deserve this...

930
02:06:21,227 --> 02:06:24,685
Hey Karan... they've
spoilt your jacket.

931
02:06:25,864 --> 02:06:27,263
Long live India!

932
02:06:59,798 --> 02:07:02,130
The scoundrel got
away with it again.

933
02:07:02,835 --> 02:07:04,462
There's nothing can we do...

934
02:07:05,904 --> 02:07:07,735
...when the law of the land protects
people like the Defence Minister.

935
02:07:10,843 --> 02:07:13,403
We have to take
drastic measures.

936
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:16,040
What do you mean?

937
02:07:17,149 --> 02:07:18,548
Do what?

938
02:07:22,187 --> 02:07:23,347
Kill him.

939
02:07:25,791 --> 02:07:26,689
What?

940
02:07:27,626 --> 02:07:31,426
Kill the Defence Minister!
Are you crazy?

941
02:07:32,264 --> 02:07:33,731
We aren't killers Sonia.

942
02:07:33,932 --> 02:07:35,297
But they are.

943
02:07:35,601 --> 02:07:37,034
Have you lost it Karan!

944
02:07:37,236 --> 02:07:39,363
It's not a blood lust...

945
02:07:40,306 --> 02:07:41,534
...it's a matter of justice.

946
02:07:41,740 --> 02:07:43,207
I'll get the gun.

947
02:07:43,409 --> 02:07:48,278
Don't fuel things, Pandey. We can't
start killing people for any small reason.

948
02:07:49,081 --> 02:07:51,845
You think Ajay's death
is a small reason?

949
02:07:52,318 --> 02:07:53,979
Ajay's mother is
a small reason?

950
02:07:54,286 --> 02:07:57,187
You've got to understand Karan.

951
02:07:57,823 --> 02:07:59,723
Lala Lajpat Rai's death
has to be avenged.

952
02:07:59,925 --> 02:08:01,392
Scott has to be killed.

953
02:08:01,593 --> 02:08:02,525
But...

954
02:08:12,071 --> 02:08:17,566
I always thought we didn't
believe in anything.

955
02:08:17,776 --> 02:08:21,872
So did I. Until now.

956
02:08:31,657 --> 02:08:33,124
Have we all gone crazy?

957
02:08:33,359 --> 02:08:38,058
He takes a morning walk at 8 a.m. Everyday,
We'll kill him then.

958
02:08:38,263 --> 02:08:44,168
Who's we, huh?
Who's going to pull the trigger?

959
02:08:44,603 --> 02:08:45,501
I'll do it!

960
02:08:48,907 --> 02:08:53,173
Even though the morning security is relaxed
there is still a danger of getting caught.

961
02:08:53,445 --> 02:08:56,778
There is no looking back now!

962
02:09:40,859 --> 02:09:49,824
The Defence Minister was on his morning walk
when two unidentified gunmen opened fire.

963
02:09:50,102 --> 02:09:55,734
He was hit by three bullets in his chest, and was
declared dead as he reached the hospital.

964
02:09:55,941 --> 02:09:58,000
No group has yet claimed
responsibility forthis incident.

965
02:10:06,718 --> 02:10:11,678
Government spokespersons believe that this is
an attempt to destablise the government.

966
02:10:13,459 --> 02:10:18,829
The country has lost a great leader
because of the cowardly act of some terrorists.

967
02:10:19,398 --> 02:10:21,423
He was a true soldier, a true patriot.

968
02:10:21,633 --> 02:10:29,597
His contribution to the country
cannot be described in words.

969
02:10:30,909 --> 02:10:31,933
Sukhi!

970
02:10:33,979 --> 02:10:36,277
Meanwhile our sources have
discovered a telephonic conversation...

971
02:10:36,482 --> 02:10:40,111
...involving middle man Rajnath Singhania
in an arms deal.

972
02:10:40,419 --> 02:10:45,049
This conversation took place just a few days
before the Defence Minister's assassination.

973
02:10:45,257 --> 02:10:48,954
The Russians want us
to reduce our commission.

974
02:10:49,261 --> 02:10:53,391
Didn't you tell them,
its not a defence deal, but our deal.

975
02:10:53,999 --> 02:10:57,127
That's why I told them. - "Take it or leave it"

976
02:10:57,336 --> 02:11:00,863
Let's go.

977
02:11:17,756 --> 02:11:18,984
Paaji, where's DJ?

978
02:11:19,191 --> 02:11:21,125
They were just here.

979
02:11:26,431 --> 02:11:28,365
He hasn't come home all night.

980
02:11:31,937 --> 02:11:33,461
Is everything alright?

981
02:11:34,540 --> 02:11:35,438
Yes, ask him to call me.

982
02:11:35,641 --> 02:11:39,236
He said he'd be
spending the night at DJ's.

983
02:11:52,758 --> 02:11:54,191
Have you seen DJ?

984
02:11:57,563 --> 02:11:59,861
Is everything alright?

985
02:12:04,369 --> 02:12:07,930
Come with me...

986
02:12:13,645 --> 02:12:16,944
Don't worry... nothing
will happen to those boys...

987
02:12:18,250 --> 02:12:20,718
Daljeet has always
been a brat...

988
02:12:20,919 --> 02:12:26,118
...he used to disappear
on his bike for days...

989
02:12:32,598 --> 02:12:34,065
I'm scared...

990
02:12:34,633 --> 02:12:37,227
Don't be afraid...

991
02:12:37,603 --> 02:12:39,798
God will take care of everything...

992
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:47,242
God watches over
the people we love.

993
02:12:58,290 --> 02:12:59,917
Defence Minister...
the martyr...

994
02:13:03,795 --> 02:13:08,732
...one of India's favourite sons...
Scoundrel!

995
02:13:10,135 --> 02:13:13,104
They're honouring him
with the National Medal of Honour.

996
02:13:13,639 --> 02:13:17,666
All our efforts, wasted.

997
02:13:18,477 --> 02:13:20,308
People need to
know the truth.

998
02:13:20,512 --> 02:13:22,776
...and who's going to tell them the truth?

999
02:13:22,981 --> 02:13:25,711
We have to
surrender ourselves.

1000
02:13:25,984 --> 02:13:26,712
What?

1001
02:13:27,886 --> 02:13:36,988
Terriffic! You want us to walk right
in and give ourselves up!

1002
02:13:37,195 --> 02:13:38,389
And who should
we surrenderto?

1003
02:13:38,597 --> 02:13:41,122
The police are
mere puppets.

1004
02:13:41,333 --> 02:13:44,393
Should we just
sit back?

1005
02:13:44,603 --> 02:13:48,232
No! Let's kill
them all!

1006
02:13:48,440 --> 02:13:49,771
Right Pandey?

1007
02:13:49,975 --> 02:13:51,636
Someone make
him shut up!

1008
02:14:00,552 --> 02:14:02,645
You always knew that
yourfather was in it.

1009
02:14:04,356 --> 02:14:05,653
You knew everything.

1010
02:14:08,860 --> 02:14:09,656
No Sukhi...

1011
02:14:09,861 --> 02:14:13,228
You're lying!

1012
02:14:13,932 --> 02:14:15,923
You always wanted to take
revenge on yourfather.

1013
02:14:16,134 --> 02:14:17,032
Sukhi, shut up!

1014
02:14:17,235 --> 02:14:21,797
Who am I to say anything?

1015
02:14:22,541 --> 02:14:26,500
DJ he's used you...

1016
02:14:27,212 --> 02:14:32,275
...he's used all of us...

1017
02:14:32,784 --> 02:14:37,187
Mark my words,
his father will bail him out.

1018
02:14:37,389 --> 02:14:39,914
But we'll get caught.
And I don't want to die DJ...

1019
02:14:40,125 --> 02:14:42,559
I don't want to die.

1020
02:14:49,568 --> 02:14:51,559
We did all this for Ajay.

1021
02:14:55,941 --> 02:14:57,306
What will happen now DJ?

1022
02:15:05,951 --> 02:15:07,350
You've decided?

1023
02:15:08,053 --> 02:15:14,151
I need to know the truth...
don't worry.

1024
02:15:15,260 --> 02:15:18,696
I'm not worried.
Just don't be late.

1025
02:15:34,346 --> 02:15:35,779
Nothing will happen
to you Karan.

1026
02:15:37,516 --> 02:15:38,414
That's a promise.

1027
02:15:39,050 --> 02:15:41,575
Just give me the
names of the others.

1028
02:15:42,788 --> 02:15:48,693
I'll get you the best lawyers,
pull all the strings possible.

1029
02:15:49,528 --> 02:15:54,864
You were forced into it, do you
understand? You were forced.

1030
02:15:59,371 --> 02:16:02,067
Do you get me?

1031
02:16:04,609 --> 02:16:07,908
Yourfather's reputation,
his life's work is at stake.

1032
02:16:08,346 --> 02:16:10,405
Why did you do it?

1033
02:16:13,919 --> 02:16:14,908
Why did you do it, Dad?

1034
02:16:15,120 --> 02:16:17,884
What did I do?

1035
02:16:18,723 --> 02:16:23,285
Ajay always said,
"I'll give my life forthis country."

1036
02:16:24,262 --> 02:16:28,790
"...I'm not afraid of death."

1037
02:16:32,304 --> 02:16:45,775
Ajay was burnt alive... and all you can
think of is sending me out of the country...

1038
02:16:46,718 --> 02:16:48,413
You killed him!

1039
02:16:49,354 --> 02:16:51,720
You made a joke of his death...

1040
02:16:51,957 --> 02:16:54,551
I know you're very disturbed...

1041
02:16:55,026 --> 02:17:00,430
Relax! Let me
handle things.

1042
02:17:01,366 --> 02:17:04,062
I'll find a way out.

1043
02:17:04,970 --> 02:17:06,232
Really Dad?
Is there a way out?

1044
02:17:06,471 --> 02:17:08,803
Of course.

1045
02:18:17,609 --> 02:18:21,136
You don't have
to do this...

1046
02:18:25,483 --> 02:18:28,418
Sukhi, this might
end badly.

1047
02:18:30,855 --> 02:18:35,952
Without you guys it will
end for me anyway...

1048
02:18:37,128 --> 02:18:38,220
Idiot.

1049
02:18:49,574 --> 02:18:56,446
Ajay's death, won't go in vain,
Ma. I promise you.

1050
02:19:32,550 --> 02:19:42,050
This is Rahul, and you've tuned
in to yourfavourite radio show...

1051
02:21:00,839 --> 02:21:04,297
Hey Karan!
What're you doing here?

1052
02:21:04,609 --> 02:21:05,735
We need a favour.

1053
02:21:05,944 --> 02:21:06,968
Sure!

1054
02:21:07,312 --> 02:21:08,574
I need you to
put us on air.

1055
02:21:09,781 --> 02:21:13,581
Put you on air?

1056
02:21:13,785 --> 02:21:15,582
Yeah, now!

1057
02:21:16,020 --> 02:21:19,581
That's impossible man...
I'll lose my job.

1058
02:21:19,791 --> 02:21:21,418
...as it is, they
don't pay me.

1059
02:21:22,794 --> 02:21:25,092
It's payback time.

1060
02:21:25,296 --> 02:21:29,426
Hey! Whateveryou say DJ!
It's your station.

1061
02:21:31,302 --> 02:21:32,997
Gun... He's got a gun!

1062
02:21:33,204 --> 02:21:35,434
Karan you go in.
I'll handle it.

1063
02:21:36,808 --> 02:21:42,212
Keep the show on.
Don't mess with us.

1064
02:21:45,817 --> 02:21:48,285
Come on... leave.

1065
02:21:51,356 --> 02:21:52,789
Paaji is anyone inside?

1066
02:21:55,160 --> 02:21:58,459
Uncleji run. Don't stop.

1067
02:22:00,165 --> 02:22:03,965
Gun... Security he's got a gun!

1068
02:22:05,737 --> 02:22:07,637
Don't be a wise guy.

1069
02:22:07,839 --> 02:22:14,244
Everybody leave!
Out! Move!

1070
02:22:14,445 --> 02:22:17,141
Don't panic we won't
harm anyone.

1071
02:22:17,348 --> 02:22:25,255
Move! Move! Move!

1072
02:22:26,591 --> 02:22:32,496
Hurry up, quick!

1073
02:22:48,713 --> 02:22:55,243
The time is 6:05 a.m. And you're listening
to "The night is still young".

1074
02:22:55,453 --> 02:22:58,354
Today I've got a
surprise guest foryou.

1075
02:22:58,723 --> 02:23:03,183
An old friend of mine Karan Singhania, who just
dropped in to say something to all of you...

1076
02:23:10,935 --> 02:23:17,101
My name is Karan Singhania... My friends
and I... we killed the Defence Minister...

1077
02:23:18,810 --> 02:23:23,076
I repeat we killed
the Defence Minister...

1078
02:23:23,281 --> 02:23:26,614
Ravi take me to the radio
station quickly. Hurry up!

1079
02:23:27,018 --> 02:23:32,081
We are not terrorists. We aren't
backed by any foreign organisation.

1080
02:23:33,091 --> 02:23:34,991
We don't even belong to
any political group...

1081
02:23:36,694 --> 02:23:38,719
We're just five students
from Delhi University.

1082
02:23:39,764 --> 02:23:42,062
We killed the
Defense Minister because...

1083
02:23:43,334 --> 02:23:51,434
...he murdered ourfriend Flight Lieutenant Ajay
Rathod and many other Air Force pilots...

1084
02:23:51,776 --> 02:23:56,406
We killed him because after he
murdered Ajay, he murdered his name...

1085
02:23:57,915 --> 02:24:08,758
Ajay's mother, right now,
is fighting for her life...

1086
02:24:11,696 --> 02:24:16,099
A Defence Minister is supposed to
safegaurd a nation. Not sell it.

1087
02:24:17,468 --> 02:24:23,964
Men like the Defence Minister
aren't just above the law... they control it.

1088
02:24:24,976 --> 02:24:33,350
We killed him because someone
had to say, "Enough!".

1089
02:24:33,951 --> 02:24:35,441
We might be wrong...

1090
02:24:36,487 --> 02:24:38,512
...because its a sin to
kill someone.

1091
02:24:39,624 --> 02:24:41,489
But we couldn't tolerate it anymore.

1092
02:24:42,393 --> 02:24:44,623
Today we are here to confess to our sin.

1093
02:24:45,963 --> 02:24:49,455
Today we are here to tell everybody
that something has to be done

1094
02:24:51,436 --> 02:24:53,165
It's got to be done.

1095
02:24:56,441 --> 02:25:00,639
We've just received news that Defence Minister's
assassins are hiding in All India Radio building.

1096
02:25:01,079 --> 02:25:10,511
Karan Singhania and his friends are still
with us. Listeners can call in on 3291777.

1097
02:25:11,222 --> 02:25:16,956
Until then, here is
"Roobaroo"

1098
02:25:21,799 --> 02:25:22,731
It's done.

1099
02:25:32,944 --> 02:25:34,571
<i>Hey, dude!</i>

1100
02:25:36,781 --> 02:25:42,981
<i>I just realized.</i>

1101
02:25:44,956 --> 02:25:51,020
<i>There's a fire
burning within me.</i>

1102
02:25:52,864 --> 02:25:54,388
<i>It's a new dawn,</i>

1103
02:25:56,634 --> 02:25:59,194
<i>I can feel its light</i>

1104
02:26:00,872 --> 02:26:06,777
<i>Burn so bright, I could,
scorch the sun</i>

1105
02:26:07,378 --> 02:26:22,954
<i>'Cause I'm face to face
with the light</i>

1106
02:26:24,061 --> 02:26:35,871
<i>The dream I once lost,
I've found.</i>

1107
02:26:36,073 --> 02:26:38,234
<i>It's blooming,</i>

1108
02:26:39,977 --> 02:26:46,041
<i>it's melting,</i>

1109
02:26:47,919 --> 02:26:55,655
<i>notes re-arranging,</i>

1110
02:26:55,860 --> 02:27:03,323
<i>into a whole new melody.</i>

1111
02:27:05,269 --> 02:27:06,964
Will they give us
good food in jail?

1112
02:27:09,373 --> 02:27:13,833
Food?
Next he'll want beer.

1113
02:27:18,783 --> 02:27:24,551
You guys have become famous. Calls are
pouring in from all overthe country.

1114
02:27:24,755 --> 02:27:26,450
Come on!
They want to talk to you...

1115
02:27:33,064 --> 02:27:33,689
Police!

1116
02:27:34,899 --> 02:27:37,527
This is unreal man. Where
did they come from?

1117
02:27:37,735 --> 02:27:39,430
This will ruin my career...

1118
02:27:39,637 --> 02:27:41,434
Shut up!

1119
02:27:42,773 --> 02:27:48,075
Karan you get on air...
We don't have much time...

1120
02:27:48,279 --> 02:27:49,007
Take care.

1121
02:27:54,519 --> 02:27:58,956
The Delhi police have reached the spot and are
rescuing civilians trapped in the building.

1122
02:28:05,897 --> 02:28:07,888
...reporting from
Mumbai's Churchgate area...

1123
02:28:08,099 --> 02:28:09,930
...reporting from
Cotton College, Guwahati.

1124
02:28:10,134 --> 02:28:11,999
...reporting from
S. P. College, Srinagar...

1125
02:28:12,203 --> 02:28:16,003
...reporting from
Lucknow University...

1126
02:28:16,707 --> 02:28:19,676
Hi, my name is Prakash.
And I want to congratulate you.

1127
02:28:19,877 --> 02:28:24,905
You did the right thing by killing him.
All our ministers should be lined up and shot.

1128
02:28:25,550 --> 02:28:28,986
Prakash, who all
will you shoot?

1129
02:28:29,387 --> 02:28:34,256
These corrupt ministers are a reflection
of our society. We've chosen them.

1130
02:28:37,695 --> 02:28:39,560
We need to change ourselves
to bring about a change.

1131
02:28:40,531 --> 02:28:44,991
Hello! This is
Principal Sharma from Indore...

1132
02:28:45,336 --> 02:28:49,238
You have set a terrible example by
taking the law into your own hands.

1133
02:28:50,708 --> 02:28:54,200
You're right sir.
We're sorry.

1134
02:28:55,079 --> 02:29:00,676
But give me the name of one
politician who has gone to jail for his crimes.

1135
02:29:01,852 --> 02:29:03,479
Who else is on
your hit-list? I

1136
02:29:04,221 --> 02:29:05,654
We have no hit-list.

1137
02:29:07,024 --> 02:29:09,219
How do you feel after
killing the Defence Minister?

1138
02:29:09,427 --> 02:29:14,455
We did not kill him out
of any blood lust...

1139
02:29:33,284 --> 02:29:36,742
If you get caught you'll be hanged.
Aren't you afraid?

1140
02:29:37,722 --> 02:29:38,620
No.

1141
02:29:46,464 --> 02:29:50,161
The college students who
have claimed responsibility...

1142
02:29:50,368 --> 02:29:51,699
...are still inside.

1143
02:29:52,503 --> 02:29:59,773
Karan, while we applaud your courage,
do you think you'll escape?

1144
02:30:00,277 --> 02:30:01,767
If we wanted to escape, we wouldn't
have been here in the first place.

1145
02:30:43,854 --> 02:30:47,221
Shit! They're shooting at us DJ!
They're shooting at us!

1146
02:30:47,425 --> 02:30:51,691
Shut up for a second!

1147
02:30:53,597 --> 02:30:56,725
They're mistaking us forterrorists.
They think we're armed.

1148
02:30:58,936 --> 02:31:03,771
Wait a minute!
I'll try to handle it.

1149
02:31:23,994 --> 02:31:30,490
No Sukhi!
What did you do!

1150
02:31:33,204 --> 02:31:37,368
Shit DJ! Just when I was getting
good with the girls...

1151
02:32:00,631 --> 02:32:04,158
My name is Indra. What's the difference
between you and a terrorist?

1152
02:32:04,368 --> 02:32:10,500
There's a big difference.
Terrorists kill innocent people. We didn't...

1153
02:32:17,982 --> 02:32:24,888
Aslam, close
the door. Quick!

1154
02:32:27,191 --> 02:32:29,091
We are not terrorists.
Why don't they...

1155
02:33:20,911 --> 02:33:23,971
It's not a lust for blood...
it's a matter of justice!

1156
02:33:24,481 --> 02:33:29,976
Why are bullets being used when its
clearthat these are college students?

1157
02:35:14,825 --> 02:35:23,756
No matter what you do, this country
will never change. It has no future.

1158
02:35:27,137 --> 02:35:32,632
No country is perfect.
You've got to make it perfect.

1159
02:35:36,313 --> 02:35:42,377
Join the police,
military, IAS...

1160
02:35:43,787 --> 02:35:46,551
Become a part of
the political system...

1161
02:35:49,159 --> 02:35:54,324
This country will change...
We will change it!

1162
02:35:56,233 --> 02:35:59,669
If you believed the Defence Minister
deserved to be punished then...

1163
02:36:00,371 --> 02:36:04,398
...what about the allegations against
yourfather? Why such double standards?

1164
02:36:07,244 --> 02:36:08,575
We'll find a way
to fix this.

1165
02:36:10,247 --> 02:36:11,578
There's just one way
to fix this Dad.

1166
02:36:31,402 --> 02:36:32,369
I'm sorry Dad...

1167
02:37:02,332 --> 02:37:03,799
My name is Daljeet Singh.

1168
02:37:05,736 --> 02:37:07,795
There are only two
ways to live your life.

1169
02:37:09,006 --> 02:37:14,911
Tolerate things the
way they are...

1170
02:37:16,513 --> 02:37:20,472
...Ortake responsibility
to change them.

1171
02:37:23,520 --> 02:37:29,152
Karan Singhania killed his
father before coming here.

1172
02:37:36,100 --> 02:37:42,437
Shit DJ!
You're bleeding badly!

1173
02:37:43,607 --> 02:37:49,807
Relax! It got tired of flowing in my veins.
It just wanted to be free.

1174
02:37:51,815 --> 02:37:54,283
Aslam... Laxman... Sukhi?

1175
02:37:55,552 --> 02:37:56,450
All gone.

1176
02:38:09,233 --> 02:38:13,533
...Karan, I think I'm in love...

1177
02:38:16,340 --> 02:38:17,898
...I nevertold you dude...

1178
02:38:19,810 --> 02:38:23,075
...I can't stop thinking
about her...

1179
02:38:26,950 --> 02:38:28,508
I know... she's something else.

1180
02:38:31,688 --> 02:38:34,248
You two'll make
a great couple.

1181
02:38:39,663 --> 02:38:45,863
There's just one problem though. I don't know
Whetherthe kids will be black or white.

1182
02:39:10,627 --> 02:39:13,596
Let me go!
They're just boys, damn it!

1183
02:40:33,443 --> 02:40:36,003
We'll turn this spark into a raging fire.

1184
02:40:36,213 --> 02:40:39,614
This will swell like a wave and
will bring an end to corruption.

1185
02:40:43,553 --> 02:40:48,217
If we want to shake the entire population out of
their slumberthen we need an explosion like this.

1186
02:40:55,032 --> 02:40:59,594
When we grow out of this, well be a nation
which is beautiful and free of corruption.

1187
02:41:06,410 --> 02:41:10,369
Lord, accept the sacrifices of these children.

1188
02:41:59,363 --> 02:42:00,830
Come Bhagat...

1189
02:42:03,667 --> 02:42:05,658
Dad, what are you doing?

1190
02:42:06,036 --> 02:42:09,995
I'm sowing mango seeds.
If I plant one, a thousand will grow.

1191
02:42:10,995 --> 02:42:20,995
