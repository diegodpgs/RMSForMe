1
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,259
Corny, who do you think
you're talking to?

2
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:41,266
If the Semple attorneys don't know
who the heir is, who does?

3
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:46,169
Come on, Corny. I've done you a lot of
favors. Who's getting the Semple dough?

4
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,174
You're asking the wrong guy, Mac.
I'm only a press agent.

5
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,335
- Newspaperman?
- Wants to know who the heir is.

6
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,675
- Hang up.
- Sorry, Mac, l can't--

7
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:56,214
- Yeah, sure, but I ain't the attorney.
- Hang up!

8
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,217
Mr. Cedar is,
and l haven't seen him in two days.

9
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,721
- Cedar, we gotta deal with the papers.
- I'm not interested in the newspapers.

10
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:07,089
But it's a great story. Somewhere
a guy is walking into 20 million bucks.

11
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,526
My first concern
is to locate the lucky man.

12
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,621
When l do, you keep
the newspapers away from him.

13
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:14,462
Okay, as long as that weekly stipend
keeps coming in.

14
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,468
We located him, Mr. Cedar.

15
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,470
- Yes, John, we got him.
- Here's the report.

16
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,733
Longfellow Deeds, single, 28,
lives in Mandrake Falls, Vermont.

17
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,741
- Thank heaven.
- Better wire him.

18
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,869
I'll do no such thing. I'm going
there myself. You too, Anderson.

19
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,207
You too, Cobb.

20
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,010
Make three train reservations
to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.

21
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,744
- Where?
- Mandrake Falls.

22
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,020
"Welcome to Mandrake Falls...

23
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,922
where the scenery enthrals...

24
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,655
where no hardship e'er befalls.

25
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,664
Welcome to Mandrake Falls."

26
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,165
That's pretty.

27
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:50,498
- You're sure he lives in this town?
- This is the town, all right.

28
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,266
Well, I hope it's not
a wild goose chase.

29
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,775
No, sir, we checked it thoroughly.
He lives here, all right.

30
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,335
l spy a native.
Let's ask him.

31
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,615
- Good morning.
- Morning, neighbors, morning.

32
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,489
That's an excellent start.
At least we've broken the ice.

33
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,324
Do you know a fellow
by the name of Longfellow Deeds?

34
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,796
Deeds?
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy.

35
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,924
Everyone knows Deeds.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,934
Must be a game he's playing.

37
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,705
We'd like to get in touch with him.

38
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,207
- Who's that?
- Deeds. Who do you think?

39
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:32,574
Oh, yes, Deeds.
Fine fellow. Very democratic.

40
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:35,580
You won't have no trouble at all.
Talks to anybody.

41
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,017
- We'd better try somebody else.
- No.

42
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:43,181
Next time he comes out, I'll straddle
him while you ask him your questions.

43
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,689
Morning, neighbors.

44
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,994
Remember us, the fellows
who were here a minute ago?

45
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,225
Oh, yes, indeedy.
l never forget a face.

46
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,926
Listen, pop.

47
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,266
We've come all the way from New York
to look up a fellow named Deeds.

48
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,806
It's important.
It's very important.

49
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,307
Don't get rough, neighbor.
Just ask.

50
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:07,312
Then please pretend, for just one
fleeting moment, that I'm asking.

51
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,281
- Where does he reside?
- Who?

52
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,453
Longfellow Deeds.
Where does he live?

53
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,014
Oh, that's what you want. Why didn't
you say so in the first place?

54
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:23,290
Those fellows don't know what they're
talking about. I'll take you there.

55
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,457
If they'd only explained to me
what they want, there'd be no trouble.

56
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,331
Oh. Will you come in,
please, gentlemen?

57
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,965
- Is Mr. Deeds in?
- No.

58
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:40,138
He's over to the park arranging a bazaar
to raise money for the fire engine.

59
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,340
Mal, you should've knowed
he was in the park.

60
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,815
Knowed it all the time,
but they wanted to see the house.

61
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:48,012
Can't read their minds
if they don't say what they want.

62
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,577
Come in, please.

63
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,090
- Can l get you a cup of tea?
- No, thank you.

64
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:55,594
Sit down. Sure l couldn't get you
a glass of lemonade or something?

65
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,596
No.
That's very kind of you.

66
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,531
- Are you related to him?
- No, I'm his housekeeper.

67
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,535
We'd like to find out something
about him. What does he do for a living?

68
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:07,869
He and Jim Mason own the tailor works,
but that's not how he makes his money.

69
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,432
- He makes most of it from his poetry.
- He writes poetry?

70
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:14,275
Oh, my goodness, yes.
Longfellow's famous.

71
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,440
He writes all those things
on postcards.

72
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:20,213
You know, for Christmas
and Easter and birthdays.

73
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,719
Sit down, please.

74
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:25,451
Here's one.
He got 25 dollars for this one.

75
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,858
"When you've nowhere to turn
and you're filled with doubt...

76
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,624
don't stand in midstream hesitating...

77
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,189
for you know that your mother's heart
cries out--

78
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,235
'I'm waiting, my boy, I'm waiting."'

79
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:41,205
Isn't that beautiful?
Isn't it a lovely sentiment?

80
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,071
Yeah.

81
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,408
Here he is now.

82
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,707
l suggest you break it to him gently.
He's liable to keel over from the shock.

83
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:56,050
They've been waiting a long while.

84
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,556
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

85
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,362
- Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
- Yes.

86
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,989
How do you do?

87
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:11,002
I'm John Cedar, of the New York firm
of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.

88
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,177
Budington must feel
like an awful stranger.

89
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,976
- Mr. Cornelius Cobb. Mr. Anderson.
- How do you do?

90
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,644
You gentlemen
make yourselves comfortable.

91
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,152
Thank you.

92
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,448
Thanks.

93
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,955
New mouthpiece.
Been waitin' two weeks for this.

94
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,164
Kids keep swiping them all the time.
They use 'em for bean shooters.

95
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,263
- What can l do for you gentlemen?
- You gentlemen going to stay to lunch?

96
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,067
- I'd like to ask you a few questions.
- All right.

97
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,041
- Are you Joseph and Mary Deeds' son?
- Yes.

98
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,043
- Your parents living?
- Why, no.

99
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:56,047
Well, Mr. Deeds, does the name of
Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?

100
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,379
Not much.
He's an uncle of mine, l think.

101
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,215
l never saw him.
My mother's name was Semple.

102
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:04,552
Well, he passed on. He was killed
in a motor accident in Italy.

103
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,559
He was? Gee, that's too bad.

104
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,721
- If there's anything l can do--
- l have good news for you, sir.

105
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,029
Mr. Semple left a large fortune
when he died.

106
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,728
He left it all to you.

107
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,836
Deducting the taxes...

108
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:22,341
it amounts to something in
the neighborhood of 20 million dollars.

109
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:26,110
How about lunch?
Are the gentlemen staying?

110
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,874
Of course.

111
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,644
She's got some fresh orange layer cake
with that thick stuff on the top.

112
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:34,652
Sure. They don't want
to go to the hotel.

113
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,692
Perhaps you didn't hear
what l said, Mr. Deeds.

114
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,321
The whole Semple fortune goes to you--
20 million dollars.

115
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:48,197
Oh, yes, l heard you, all right.
Twenty million is quite a lot, isn't it?

116
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:51,168
- It'll do in a pinch.
- Yes, indeed.

117
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:54,673
l wonder why he left me all that money.
l don't need it.

118
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,122
Mr. Cobb here
is an ex-newspaperman.

119
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,318
Associated with your uncle
for many years, as a sort of buffer.

120
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,122
Buffer?

121
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:19,358
Yeah.
A glorified doormat.

122
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,890
Rich people need someone to keep the
crowds away. The world's full of pests.

123
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,402
Then there's the newspapers.

124
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,497
One must know when to seek publicity
and when to avoid it.

125
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,600
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.

126
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,702
l can't think
of a rhyme for "Budington."

127
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,440
Why should you?

128
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,916
Whenever l run across a funny name,
l like to poke around for a rhyme.

129
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,919
- Don't you?
- No.

130
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,350
- I've got one for Cobb.
- Yeah?

131
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:49,554
There once was a man named Cobb
who kept Semple away from the mob.

132
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,063
Came the turn of the tide
and Semple, he died.

133
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,565
Now poor Cobb's out of a job.

134
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,363
- Sounds like two weeks' notice to me.
- Huh?

135
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:03,169
I've gotten the sackeroo in many ways,
but never in rhyme.

136
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,437
I don't mean that.
I'll need your help.

137
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,536
That's different,
if it's just poetry.

138
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,046
Are you married?

139
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,742
Who, me? No.

140
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,376
He's too fussy for that.
That's what's the matter with him.

141
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,785
There's lots of nice girls
right here in Mandrake Falls--

142
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,790
Don't pay any attention to her.

143
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:23,318
He's got a lot of foolish notions
about saving a lady in distress.

144
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,694
Now, you keep out of this.

145
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:30,600
Saving a lady in distress, eh? We all
have dreams like that when we're young.

146
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,265
Incidentally, we'd better get started.
You'll have to pack.

147
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,774
- What for?
- You're going to New York with us.

148
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,935
- When?
- This afternoon, 4:00.

149
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,945
l don't think
we've got any suitcases.

150
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:44,278
Well, we could borrow a couple
from Mrs. Simpson.

151
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,945
She went to Niagara Falls
last year.

152
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,512
I'm kinda nervous. I've never been
away from Mandrake Falls in my life.

153
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,526
- Like to see Grant's tomb, though.
- I can understand that.

154
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,028
We'll meet you at the train
at 4:00.

155
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,190
Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one
of the richest men in the country.

156
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,200
See you later.
Good-bye. Thank you.

157
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,702
- See you later, kid.
- Good day, sir.

158
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:15,747
Did you hear what he said?
Do you know how much 20 million is?

159
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:20,548
I don't care. You sit there and eat
your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.

160
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,187
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

161
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,387
For he's a jolly good fellow

162
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,192
Which nobody can deny

163
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:40,136
l can't find him. l looked everywhere.
His house is locked up.

164
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:43,141
- Probably had a change of heart.
- He wasn't anxious to come.

165
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,404
Here comes the train.

166
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,873
- Look.
- What?

167
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,815
That tuba player.

168
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,488
Well...

169
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,124
now I've seen everything.

170
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,309
Good-bye, Mrs. Meredith!

171
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,346
Good-bye, Jim!

172
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,252
Bye, Buddy!

173
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,525
Gosh, l got a lot of friends.

174
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,363
- Have a drink?
- No, thanks.

175
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:23,707
Cigar?

176
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,266
No, thank you.

177
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,278
l wouldn't worry if l were you.

178
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:32,215
A large portion like this entails great
responsibility, but you'll have help.

179
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,684
So don't worry.
Leave everything to me.

180
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,245
- l wasn't worried about that.
- No?

181
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:40,952
l was wondering where they're gonna
get another tuba player for the band.

182
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,838
- Hello, John. Where you been?
- I've been fishing.

183
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,850
Good morning, Mr. Cedar.

184
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,045
Good morning.
Where are they?

185
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,148
- Waiting for you.
- Good morning, Mr. Cedar.

186
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,715
Good morning.

187
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,056
- Hello, boys.
- Well, what's he like?

188
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,658
We've nothing to worry about.
He's as naive as a child.

189
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,168
Close that door.

190
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:27,000
- Get Mrs. Cedar on the phone.
- John, what happened?

191
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,666
The smartest thing l ever did
was to make that trip.

192
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,266
- John, did you get--
- No, Budington.

193
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,777
l didn't get the power of attorney,
but I will.

194
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:37,612
l asked him what he was going to do with
the money. What do you suppose he said?

195
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:38,980
Give it away.

196
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:42,748
- The boy must be a nitwit.
- John, you had the right hunch.

197
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,256
- John, we can't afford--
- l know, Budington.

198
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,054
We can't afford to have the books
investigated right now.

199
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,061
You've said that a thousand times.

200
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,063
What if they fall
into somebody else's hands?

201
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,564
It hasn't happened yet.

202
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,725
But half-a-million dollars,
my goodness--

203
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,666
Will you stop worrying!

204
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:01,638
l got Semple to turn it all over to us.
And who got power of attorney from him?

205
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,335
All right, then I'll get it again.

206
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,503
Now, take it easy. Those books
will never leave this office.

207
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,970
Yokel.
Nothing but a yokel.

208
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,984
Your uncle must've been mad
to leave all that money to him.

209
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,488
You're as closely related to him
as he is, and what did you get?

210
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,022
- I say, what did you get?
- Stop yelling.

211
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:25,029
- Can l help it if Uncle didn't like me?
- l told you to be nice to him.

212
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:28,032
Ten years we've waited
for that old man to kick off.

213
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,501
Then we were gonna be on Easy Street.
Yeah, on Easy Street.

214
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,131
- It's too late now. You're a nuisance.
- That's just what I'm gonna be.

215
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,506
I'm gonna be a nuisance
until I get ahold of some of that money.

216
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:39,771
He's news!

217
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,114
Every time he blows his nose,
it's news.

218
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:46,515
A corn-fed bohunk like that falling
into the Semple fortune is hot copy.

219
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:49,019
It's gotta be personal.
It's gotta have an angle.

220
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:52,251
What does he think about?
How does it feel to be a millionaire?

221
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:55,088
What does he think of New York?
Is he smart? Dumb? A million angles.

222
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,061
He's been here three days,
and what have you numbskulls brought in?

223
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,655
-A half-wit novice could've done better.
-We tried--

224
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,258
Am I talking too loud
or annoying anybody?

225
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:06,600
You know Corny Cobb.
He's keeping him under lock and key.

226
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,038
Never mind.
Use what little brains you've got.

227
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:13,442
Find out something for yourselves,
you imbecilic stupes.

228
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:16,948
Now get out of here before
l really tell you what l think of you.

229
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:26,048
- What was that?
- l said you had dirty plaster.

230
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:30,787
You too.

231
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:34,390
Thought l could depend on you,
but you're as bad as the rest.

232
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,863
Look. l can do it.

233
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,767
What's gotten into you, Babe?

234
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:42,773
Normally you'd blast this town wide open
before letting Cobb get away with this.

235
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,775
He's not getting away with anything.

236
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,505
Babe, get me some stuff on this guy
and you can have--

237
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,070
- Can I have a month's vacation?
- With pay.

238
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:55,815
With pay? Leave four columns open
on the front page tomorrow.

239
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:59,551
I'll keep the whole front page open.
What are you gonna do?

240
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,217
Have lunch.

241
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,572
The first time l ever
had a suit made on purpose.

242
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,343
It's merely a suggestion, Mr. Deeds...

243
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:24,348
but if you'll give me power of attorney,
we'll take care of everything.

244
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:28,182
It'll save you a lot of annoyances.
Everyone will try to sell you something.

245
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:31,347
There have been a lot of them already.
Strangest kind of people.

246
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,653
Salesmen, politicians, moochers.
All want something.

247
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,456
Haven't had a minute to myself.
Haven't seen Grant's tomb yet.

248
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:39,554
Your uncle didn't bother with that sort
of thing. He left everything to us.

249
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,565
He traveled, enjoyed himself.

250
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,931
You should do the same thing.

251
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,767
Besides wanting to be my lawyer...

252
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,773
you want to handle
my investments too?

253
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:53,278
- Yes. That is to say--
- How much extra would it cost?

254
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,280
- No extra charge.
- That's a lot of extra work.

255
00:16:56,348 --> 00:17:01,012
But that's a service Cedar, Cedar,
Cedar and Budington usually donates.

256
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,384
Budington.

257
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,889
l can't think of a rhyme
for Budington yet.

258
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:09,587
The gentlemen from the opera are
still waiting in the board room, sir.

259
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,595
They're getting a trifle impatient.

260
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,688
l forgot about them.
What do you think they want?

261
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,758
Your uncle was chairman of the board.
They probably expect you to carry on.

262
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:20,430
I'll tell those mugs to keep their
shirts on and that you'll be right down.

263
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,498
Oh, did you send that telegram
to Jim Mason yet?

264
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,509
Jim Mason?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

265
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:29,274
No, l didn't send it. I've got it
written out, though. Here it is.

266
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:32,010
"Arthur's been with the tailor works
too long. Stop.

267
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:35,019
Don't think we should fire him.
Longfellow."

268
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,555
Send it right away.
l don't want him to fire Arthur.

269
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,648
Sure, we don't want to fire Arthur.

270
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,660
He was the last baby
my father delivered, Arthur was.

271
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,162
You ought to give this matter
some thought.

272
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,494
l mean about
the power of attorney.

273
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,535
Oh, yes, l will.
I'll give it a lot of thought.

274
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,537
There was a fellow named Winslow
here a while ago...

275
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:56,233
wanted to handle my business
for nothing too.

276
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,835
Puzzles me why these people want
to work for nothing. It isn't natural.

277
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,210
l guess I'd better
think about it some more.

278
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,875
That's that.

279
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,885
You go to an awful lot of work
to keep a fella warm.

280
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:08,942
Yes, sir.

281
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,114
A Mr. Hallor to see you, sir.

282
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,784
Hallor?
Don't let him in.

283
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,190
Why not? Who's he?

284
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,661
A lawyer representing a woman.
Some claim against the estate.

285
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,496
If he has a claim, we'd better see him.
Send him in.

286
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,968
He'll cause you a lot of trouble.

287
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:28,302
How can he make trouble for me?
I haven't done anything.

288
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:31,865
- l told you to take this up with me.
- I'm tired of being pushed around.

289
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,878
I don't care
how important you are.

290
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,710
- Mr. Deeds, l represent Mrs. Semple.
- Mrs. Semple?

291
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,717
Your uncle's common-law wife.
She has a legal claim on the estate.

292
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,812
- Suppose we let the courts decide--
- You wouldn't dare take this to court.

293
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,481
I'll leave it to you.

294
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:49,049
Would any court not be in sympathy with
a woman who gave up her best years...

295
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,062
for an old man like your uncle?

296
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,065
- What kind of wife did you say?
- Common-law wife.

297
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,398
- On top of that, there's a child.
- Child? My uncle?

298
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,528
- Yes, sir.
- That's awful.

299
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,539
The poor woman should be
taken care of immediately.

300
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,041
I'm glad to see you're
willing to be reasonable.

301
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:07,442
If she was his wife, she should have
the money. l don't want a penny.

302
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,105
Don't make any rash promises.

303
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:12,173
Better go. That opera mob is about to
break into the mad song from Lucia.

304
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,243
l don't wanna keep them waiting.
They're important people.

305
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,653
- Very good, sir.
- l can't go down like this.

306
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,659
l wish you'd go along with me, Cobb.
They're all strangers to me.

307
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,127
- What about it, Mr. Deeds?
- Huh?

308
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,654
Oh. You'll excuse me, won't you?
I'll be right back.

309
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,908
Gee, I'm busy. Do the opera people
always come here for their meetings?

310
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,910
- Uh-huh.
- That's funny. Why's that?

311
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,344
Why do mice go
where there's cheese?

312
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:46,106
I'm led to believe
the young man's quite childish.

313
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,120
We won't have any difficulty
getting him to put up the entire amount.

314
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,885
- After all, it's only $180,000.
- Excellent idea.

315
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,689
We're very fortunate the young man
is so sympathetic toward music.

316
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,697
He plays the tuba
in the town band.

317
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,424
- Here he comes.
- Good.

318
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:09,974
The first order of business will be
electing a new chairman of the board.

319
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,773
As a sentimental gesture toward
the best friend that opera ever had--

320
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,278
the late Mr. Semple--

321
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:18,316
l think it only fitting that his nephew,
Mr. Longfellow Deeds...

322
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,010
should be made our next chairman.

323
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,713
- l therefore nominate him.
- Seconded.

324
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,120
- All those in favor?
- Aye!

325
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,623
Carried.

326
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,557
Our congratulations, Mr. Deeds.

327
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,563
- I'm chairman?
- Yes. You've just been elected.

328
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,566
- I'm chairman!
- Happy voyage.

329
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,568
Right here, Mr. Deeds.

330
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,668
Now, the next order of business--
the reading of the secretary's minutes.

331
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,676
- Move we dispense with it.
- Seconded.

332
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,177
- All in favor?
- Aye!

333
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,180
l think they can be
dispensed with.

334
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,183
-We're ready for the treasurer's report.
-Move we dispense with it.

335
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,684
- Seconded.
- All in favor.

336
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,688
Quite right. Now, gentlemen,
the next order of business--

337
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:01,192
Just a minute.
What does the chairman do?

338
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,694
Well, the chairman
presides the meeting.

339
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,252
That's what l thought.

340
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,460
But, if you don't mind, I'm rather
interested in the treasurer's report.

341
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,741
The treasurer reports a deficit
of $180,000 for the current year.

342
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:22,575
A deficit?
You mean we lost that much?

343
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:26,084
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera
is not conducted for profit.

344
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,312
It isn't?
What is it conducted for?

345
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,911
It's an artistic institution.

346
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,887
- We own an opera house, don't we?
- We do.

347
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,053
- And we give shows?
- We provide opera.

348
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,427
But you charge--
l mean, you sell tickets?

349
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,432
- Of course.
- And it doesn't pay?

350
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,297
Impossible.
The opera has never paid.

351
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:46,428
Well, then, we must give
the wrong kind of shows.

352
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,963
There isn't any wrong or right kind.
Opera is opera.

353
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:55,241
l guess, but I wouldn't care to be head
of a business that kept losing money.

354
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,906
That wouldn't be common sense.

355
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,679
Incidentally, where is
the $180,000 coming from?

356
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,744
Well, we were rather expecting it
to come from you.

357
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,248
- Me?
- Naturally.

358
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,792
Excuse me, gentlemen.
There's nothing natural about that.

359
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,797
Fire engine!

360
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,400
Gee, that was a pip!

361
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:29,936
We're gonna have one like that in
Mandrake Falls soon, with a siren too.

362
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,381
Uh, where were we?

363
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,682
You see, the opera is not conducted
like any ordinary business.

364
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,814
- Why not?
- Because it just isn't a business.

365
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,654
Maybe it isn't to you,
but it certainly is to me...

366
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:44,992
if l have to make up a loss
of $180,000.

367
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,827
If it's losing that much money,
there must be something wrong.

368
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:51,027
Maybe you charge too much.
Maybe you're selling bad merchandise.

369
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,037
A lot of things.
l don't know.

370
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:56,040
You see, I expect to do
a lot of good with that money...

371
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:59,635
and I can't afford to put it into
anything that l don't look into.

372
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:03,169
That's my decision
for the time being, gentlemen.

373
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:06,342
Good-bye, and thank you
for making me chairman.

374
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:10,445
Gentlemen, you'll find the
smelling salts in the medicine chest.

375
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,237
Sorry to keep you waiting.

376
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:31,298
Those opera people are funny.
They wanted me to put up $180,000.

377
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:34,311
- What about it, Mr. Deeds?
- l turned them down, naturally.

378
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,973
- No, l mean about my client.
- Oh.

379
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,482
We'll have to do something
about the common wife.

380
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,145
- Tails tonight, sir?
- Tails?

381
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,812
Why, that's a monkey suit.

382
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:47,052
You want people to laugh at me?
I've never worn one of those in my life.

383
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,059
Good-bye, and thank you, sir.

384
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:51,561
Good-bye.
Wants me to wear a monkey suit.

385
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,565
- We don't want to appear greedy.
- Huh?

386
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:58,262
- l say, we don't want to appear greedy.
- Oh, that.

387
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,804
- What are you doing?
- Assisting you, sir.

388
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:04,808
l don't want anybody holding
the ends of my pants. Get up from there.

389
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,940
Imagine that.
Holding the ends of my pants.

390
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,677
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law
to one-third of the estate.

391
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,982
- Don't ever get on your knees again.
- No, sir.

392
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,214
What'd you say?

393
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,985
Mrs. Semple is entitled
to one-third of the estate.

394
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:22,117
One-third.
That's about seven million dollars.

395
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:25,129
Well, we didn't expect that much.

396
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,893
I'm sure I can get her
to settle quietly for one million.

397
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,434
Take up any settlement talk
with me in the office.

398
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,129
I'll do no such thing.

399
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:35,298
That's right. There's only one place
you're going, and that's out the door.

400
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,740
- You're making a mistake.
- Oh, no, I'm not.

401
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,107
l don't like your face.

402
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:43,944
Besides, there's something fishy about
a person who'd settle for a million...

403
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,006
when they can get seven million.

404
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:49,144
I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar,
who's supposed to be a smart man...

405
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,654
couldn't see through that.

406
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,485
Now, wait a minute, buddy--

407
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:56,118
One nice thing about being rich--
you ring a bell and things happen.

408
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,924
When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor,
I'll ask him to show you to the door.

409
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,589
Many people
don't know where it is.

410
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:04,396
No use in getting tough. That'll
get you nowhere. We've got letters.

411
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:07,336
- Show Mr. Hallor to the front door.
- Yes, sir.

412
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:11,603
There isn't any wife, there aren't any
letters, and I think you're a crook...

413
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,769
so you'd better watch your step.

414
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,747
I can't hold out any longer.

415
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,218
Lamb bites wolf.
Beautiful.

416
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,118
It's only common sense.

417
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,453
I can't hold out any longer either,
Mr. Deeds.

418
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,857
Being an attorney for you
will be a very simple affair.

419
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:32,761
You're not my attorney yet, not
until l find out what's on your mind.

420
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:36,460
Suppose you get the books straightened
out so I can have a look at 'em.

421
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,127
Yes, of course, if you wish.

422
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,604
But you must be prepared. This sort
of thing will be daily routine.

423
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:44,608
If it becomes annoying,
you let me know.

424
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,439
Good-bye, Mr. Deeds.

425
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:47,944
Good-bye, sir.

426
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:53,183
Even his hands are oily.

427
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:03,591
Well, how about tonight? What would you
like in the way of entertainment?

428
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:04,924
Entertainment?

429
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:08,488
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones.
Tall and stately.

430
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,058
How would you like yours?
Dark or fair?

431
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,934
Tall or short? Fat or thin?
Tough or tender?

432
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,667
- What are you talking about?
- Women.

433
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,174
Ever heard of 'em?

434
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,801
Oh!

435
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:23,939
- Name your poison, and I'll supply it.
- Some other time, Cobb.

436
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:25,949
Okay. You're the boss.

437
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,144
When your blood begins to boil,
yell out.

438
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,743
I'll be seeing you.

439
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:35,392
He talks about women
as if they were cattle.

440
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,020
Every man to his taste, sir.

441
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:41,259
Tell me, Walter, are all these stories
l hear about my uncle true?

442
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:45,360
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many
as 20 in the house at the same time.

443
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:49,771
- Twenty? What'd he do with 'em?
- That is something l never found out.

444
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,932
Hey! You going out?

445
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,998
- Yes. Isn't that all right?
- No.

446
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:26,441
- You never go out without telling us.
- Who are you?

447
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,342
We're your bodyguards.

448
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:29,846
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

449
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:32,280
Mr. Cobb said
stick to your tail.

450
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,945
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb, but l
don't want anybody sticking to my tail.

451
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,012
Sorry, mister.
Orders is orders.

452
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:41,024
We gotta get you up in the morning,
put you to bed at night.

453
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:44,027
Only it's all right. No matter
what we see, we don't see nothin', see?

454
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,086
- That's gonna be fun.
- Some people like it.

455
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:49,190
- Will you do something for me first?
- Sure.

456
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,735
Put that away, slug.
At your service.

457
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:54,533
- Would you get my trunk out for me?
- Certainly.

458
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,039
With pleasure.

459
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,107
We're your bodyguards!
You can't do this!

460
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,222
There he is.

461
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:21,997
- That's him.
- That's who?

462
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:25,002
- Get your cameras ready and follow me.
- What are you gonna do?

463
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,005
Never mind. Follow me
and grab whatever you can get.

464
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,200
It's gonna be
the same old thing.

465
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,209
- That dame is nuts.
- Right.

466
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,132
You fainted.

467
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,139
Oh, did l? I'm sorry.

468
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:05,870
- Can I help you?
- No, thank you. I'll be all right.

469
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:07,976
This is my house.

470
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:11,641
- I'd like to--
- Oh, no, really, I'll be all right.

471
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:14,511
What happened?

472
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:18,454
Well, l-- I guess
l walked too much.

473
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,855
I've been looking
for a job all day.

474
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:24,952
l found one too.
l start tomorrow.

475
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:28,396
You've been awfully kind.
Thank you very much.

476
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,070
Hey! Taxi!

477
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:48,616
Hey, Stu, follow that cab
they just got into, will ya!

478
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:51,780
- Hurry up! Step on it!
- Come on, let's go!

479
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:18,977
Feel better now?

480
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,887
This tastes so good.

481
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,889
Mr. Deeds, l don't know
how l can ever thank you.

482
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:28,653
Tell me more about yourself.

483
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:33,254
Well, l guess I've told you
almost everything there is to tell.

484
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:36,095
My folks live in a small town
near Hartford.

485
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,864
I'm down here alone
trying to make a living.

486
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:42,202
I'm really just a nobody.

487
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:47,600
Oh, that was so lovely.
Thank you.

488
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:55,812
You were a lady in distress,
weren't you?

489
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,307
What?

490
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,051
Nothing.

491
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,984
Waiter.

492
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:06,546
- Has anybody come in yet?
- Uh, no. Nobody important.

493
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:09,058
Be sure and point them out to me.

494
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:12,756
I'm a writer myself, you know.
l write poetry.

495
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:19,602
Well...

496
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:22,606
you've been having quite
an exciting time, haven't you?

497
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:26,166
With all these meetings,
business deals, society people...

498
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:27,711
haven't you been having fun?

499
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,576
No.

500
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:33,447
That is, I didn't until I met you.
l like talking to you though.

501
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:36,453
Imagine my finding you
right on my doorstep.

502
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,957
- Brookfield's just come in.
- Who? The poet? Where?

503
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:43,221
Over at that big round table.
The one that looks like a poodle.

504
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:48,090
Look, there's Brookfield,
the poet.

505
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,861
Really?

506
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:52,962
Pardon.

507
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:57,064
Longfellow Deeds, who just inherited
the Semple fortune, wants to meet you.

508
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,167
Oh, yes. l read about him.
He writes poetry on postcards.

509
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:03,179
Let's invite him over.
Might get a couple of laughs.

510
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:04,942
Getting rather dull around here.

511
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,608
It's always dull here.

512
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,276
- I'll get him.
- Good.

513
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,720
Mr. Henneberry.
Mr. Morrow. Bill.

514
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:18,125
This is Mr. Deeds and his fiancee
from Mandrake Falls.

515
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,221
How do you do, Mr. Deeds?

516
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,602
Nice of you to ask us
to come and sit with you.

517
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,468
Back home we never get a chance
to meet famous people.

518
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:32,566
- Waiter, a little service here.
- Yes, a drink for Mr. Deeds.

519
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:35,134
- l don't want it, thank you.
- You must. All poets drink.

520
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:38,182
Tell me, Mr. Deeds,
how do you go about writing your poems?

521
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:41,343
We craftsmen are very interested
in one another's methods.

522
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:45,150
Do you have to wait for an inspiration,
or do you just dash it off?

523
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:48,283
- Well, I--
- Morrow just dashes them off.

524
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:52,591
Yeah. That's what my publishers
have been complaining about.

525
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,996
Well, your readers don't complain,
Mr. Morrow.

526
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,330
Oh. Thanks.

527
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,496
How about you, Mr. Deeds?

528
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,835
Well, I write mine on order.

529
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:06,673
The people l work for tell me
what they want, and then l write it.

530
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:08,371
Amazing!

531
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,107
Why, that's true genius.

532
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:15,050
Have you any peculiar characteristics
when you're creating?

533
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,849
Well, I-- l play the tuba.

534
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:19,822
How original.

535
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,826
Well, I've been playing the harmonica
for 40 years.

536
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,725
Didn't do me a bit of good.

537
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:29,494
You wouldn't have one
in your pocket, would you?

538
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,092
What, a tuba?

539
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:35,105
No, a postcard
with one of your poems on it.

540
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:38,540
- Oh, no.
- You don't carry a pocketful with you?

541
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:41,601
Oh, too bad. l was hoping
you'd autograph one for me.

542
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,079
- l was too.
- Now wait a minute, boys.

543
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,981
Perhaps Mr. Deeds
would recite one for us.

544
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,985
That's a very good idea.

545
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,453
Nothing like a poet
reciting his own stuff.

546
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,547
How about a Mother's Day poem?

547
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:57,890
Exactly. Give us one that rings
the great American heart.

548
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,896
Yes. Go ahead.

549
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:04,901
l get the idea. l know why
l was invited here-- to make fun of me.

550
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:07,335
- Oh, not at all.
- Don't be ridiculous.

551
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:08,838
Look, he's temperamental.

552
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:11,568
Yeah? What if I am?
What about it?

553
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:16,680
It's easy to make fun of somebody
if you don't care how much you hurt 'em.

554
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,011
I think your poems are swell,
Mr. Brookfield...

555
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,017
but I'm disappointed in you.

556
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:23,144
l must look funny to you...

557
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:26,281
but maybe if you went to Mandrake Falls
you'd look just as funny to us...

558
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:29,292
only nobody would laugh at you
and make you feel ridiculous...

559
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,124
because that wouldn't be
good manners.

560
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:36,155
Maybe writing postcard poems is comical,
but a lot of people think they're good.

561
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,168
Anyway, it's the best l can do.

562
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,171
So if you'll excuse me,
we'll be leaving.

563
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,936
l guess l found out that
all famous people aren't big people.

564
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:49,870
Just one thing more.

565
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:52,882
If it weren't for Miss Dawson being
here, I'd bump your heads together.

566
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,611
Oh, l don't mind.

567
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,812
Then l guess maybe l will.

568
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,127
Waiter!

569
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:06,387
Eureka!

570
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:10,433
Stop it.
Go away, go away.

571
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,991
Step aside.

572
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:15,334
Say, fella, you neglected me
and I feel very put out.

573
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:18,534
Look, sock it right there, will ya?
Sock it hard.

574
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:21,237
- I've got it off my chest.
- Oh, listen.

575
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:24,873
The difference between them and me is,
I know when I've been a skunk.

576
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:29,545
You take me to the nearest newsstand and
I'll eat a pack of your postcards raw.

577
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,019
Raw!

578
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:34,922
Oh, what a magnificent deflation
of smugness!

579
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:37,984
Pal, you've added ten years
to my life.

580
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:42,556
A poet with a straight left
and a right hook? Delicious. Delicious.

581
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:47,127
You're my guest from now on,
forever and a day, even unto eternity.

582
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,868
- Thanks, but we're going sightseeing.
- Fine. Fine. Swell.

583
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:55,003
You've just shown me a sight lovely
to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate.

584
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,014
Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet--
Thanks--

585
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:00,880
and I'll show you sights
that you've never seen before.

586
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:03,512
I'd like to see Grant's tomb
and the Statue of Liberty.

587
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:06,989
You'll not only see those,
but before the evening's half through...

588
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,424
you'll be leaning against
the Leaning Tower of Pisa...

589
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:10,926
you'll mount Mount Everest.

590
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,429
I'll show you the pyramids
and all the little pyramidees...

591
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,431
leaping from sphinx to sphinx.

592
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:19,435
Pal, how would you like to go on
a real old-fashioned binge?

593
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,801
- Binge?
- Yeah, l mean the regain McCoy.

594
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,806
You play saloon with me...

595
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:27,605
and I'll introduce you to every wit,
nitwit and half-wit in New York.

596
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:31,671
We'll go on a twister that'll make
Omar the soused philosopher of Persia...

597
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,684
look like an anemic
on a goat's milk diet.

598
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,846
- That oughta be fun, huh?
- Fun? Say--

599
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,720
Listen, I'll take you
on a bender...

600
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:45,091
that will live in your memory
as a thing of beauty and a joy forever.

601
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,596
Boy? Boy, my headpiece!

602
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,964
O Tempora! O Mores! O Bacchus!

603
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,162
- Oh, you're drunk.
- Oh, you're right!

604
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:58,266
- If we go with him, we'll see things.
- I guess we will.

605
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:05,748
"'I play the tuba to help me think.'

606
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:08,751
This is one of the many startling
statements made by Longfellow Deeds...

607
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:10,343
New York's new Cinderella Man...

608
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:13,413
who went out last night to prove
that his uncle, the late M.W. Semple...

609
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,459
from whom he inherited
20 million dollars...

610
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:19,257
was an amateur in the art of standing
the town on its cauliflower ear."

611
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:24,093
"Cinderella Man."
That's sensational, Babe, sensational.

612
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,193
Took some high-powered acting,
believe me.

613
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,761
- Did it?
- I was the world's sweetest ingenue.

614
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,966
Is he really that big a sap?

615
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:34,307
He's the original.
There are no carbon copies of that one.

616
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:38,439
"Cinderella Man." That'll stick to him
for the rest of his life.

617
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:42,043
Can you imagine Cobb's face
when he reads this?

618
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,280
If we could sell tickets,
we'd make a fortune.

619
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:47,290
- How'd you get the picture?
- Had the boys follow us.

620
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:48,484
Marvelous.

621
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,789
"At 2:00 a.m.
Mr. Deeds tied up traffic...

622
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:53,955
while he fed a bagful of donuts
to a horse.

623
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,233
When asked why he was doing it
he replied...

624
00:38:57,301 --> 00:39:01,431
'To see how many donuts the horse would
eat before he asked for some coffee."'

625
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:08,575
Beautiful!
What happened after that?

626
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:12,309
l don't know. l had to write the story.
He was so drunk he never even missed me.

627
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,647
When are you gonna see him again?

628
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:16,809
Tonight, maybe.

629
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:19,651
I'll phone him at noon--
my lunch hour.

630
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,658
I'm a stenographer, you know.
Mary Dawson.

631
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,160
You're a genius, Babe, a genius.

632
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,162
I even moved into
MabeI Dawson's apartment...

633
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,721
in case old snoopy Cobb
might start looking around.

634
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:31,734
Good. Stay there.
Don't show your face down here.

635
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:35,363
I'll say you're on vacation. No one will
know where the stories are coming from.

636
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:39,466
Stick close to him. You can get
an exclusive out of him every day.

637
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,568
We'll have the other papers crazy.

638
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:44,113
- Babe, l could kiss ya!
- Oh, no. No.

639
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:47,548
- Our deal was for a month's vacation.
- Sure.

640
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:50,348
- With pay.
- You'll get it, Babe.

641
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,451
Mr. Deeds, sir.

642
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:57,358
You really must get up.
It's late.

643
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,919
- You're Walter, aren't you?
- Yes, sir.

644
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:01,624
Just wanted to make sure.

645
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:06,796
If you'll permit me to say so, sir, you
were out on quite a bender last night.

646
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,806
Bender?
You're wrong, Walter.

647
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:13,867
We started out to a binge,
but we never got to it.

648
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:15,377
Yes, sir.

649
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:19,708
- What's that?
- A prairie oyster, sir.

650
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:21,376
Prairie oyster?

651
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:24,888
Yes, sir.
It makes the head feel smaller.

652
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,665
Oh.

653
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:42,271
- Has Miss Dawson called yet?
- No Miss Dawson has called, sir.

654
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,341
She was the lady in distress.

655
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:48,173
She wouldn't let me help her.
Had a lot of pride. I like that.

656
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:50,509
Oh, l do too, sir.

657
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:54,813
I'd better call her up and apologize.
l don't remember taking her home.

658
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:58,844
I'd venture to say you don't remember
much of what happened last night, sir.

659
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:01,289
What do you mean?
l remember everything.

660
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:04,794
Hand me my pants. l wrote
her phone number on a piece of paper.

661
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:07,057
You have no pants, sir.

662
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,123
You came home last night
without them.

663
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:13,602
- I did what?
- You came home without any clothes.

664
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,162
You were in your shorts.

665
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,673
Yes, sir.

666
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:24,976
l couldn't walk around on the streets
without any clothes. I'd be arrested.

667
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,313
That's what
the two policemen said, sir.

668
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:29,909
- What two policemen?
- The ones who brought you home, sir.

669
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,616
They said you and another gentleman kept
going up and down the street shouting...

670
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:38,287
"Back to nature! Clothes are a blight
on civilization! Back to nature!"

671
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:43,593
Listen, Walter, if a man named Morrow
calls up, tell him I'm not in.

672
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,636
He may be a great author, but...

673
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:49,332
l think he's crazy, Walter.

674
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:51,974
Yes, sir.

675
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:56,178
Oh, by the way, did you--

676
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:01,312
-The knee.
-But how will l put on the slipper, sir?

677
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:02,818
Yes, sir.

678
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:12,893
l beg pardon, sir, but did you ever
find what you were looking for, sir?

679
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,396
Looking for?

680
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:17,434
You kept searching me last night, sir,
going through all my pockets.

681
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:20,436
You said you were looking
for a rhyme for "Budington."

682
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,365
- Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
- Very good, sir.

683
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:28,377
Oh, I beg pardon.
A telegram came for you, sir.

684
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,378
I'll get you some black coffee, sir.

685
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,051
Did you see all this stuff
in the paper?

686
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:48,530
- Arthur wants to quit.
- Arthur? Who's Arthur?

687
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,090
He's the shipping clerk
at the tailor works.

688
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,363
Wants a two-dollar raise,
or he'll quit.

689
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:56,372
What do I care about Arthur?
Did you see this stuff in the paper?

690
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,001
How did it get in there? What did you
do last night? Who were you talking to?

691
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,011
And what did you do
to those bodyguards?

692
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,206
They quit this morning.
Said you locked them up.

693
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:06,215
They insisted on following me.

694
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:09,377
- What do you think bodyguards are for?
- What do they mean by this?

695
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:12,786
- "Cinderella Man."
- Are those stories true?

696
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:14,619
"Cinderella Man"?

697
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:19,061
They'd call you anything if you gave 'em
a chance. They got you down as a sap.

698
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:22,758
- I'll punch this editor in the nose.
- No, you don't! Get this clear.

699
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:26,098
Socking people in the nose
is no solution for anything.

700
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:30,038
- Sometimes it's the only solution.
- Not editors. Take my word for it.

701
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:33,304
- If they're gonna poke fun at me, I'm--
- Listen, Longfellow.

702
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:34,844
You got brains, kid.

703
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:37,904
You'll get along swell if you'll only
curb your homicidal instincts.

704
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:42,112
And keep your trap shut.
These newshounds are gunning for you.

705
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:45,121
- What about this "Cinderella Man"?
- I'll take care of that.

706
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:48,124
I'll keep that stuff out of the papers,
if you'll help me.

707
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:51,491
But l can't do anything
if you go around talking to people.

708
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:55,589
Will you promise me
to be careful from now on?

709
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,600
Yes, l guess I'll have to.

710
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:59,260
Thank you.

711
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:03,432
If you feel the building rock,
it'll be me, blasting into this editor.

712
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,715
Cobb's right.
l mustn't talk to anybody.

713
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:15,718
- Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
- Who? Miss Dawson?

714
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:17,720
- Yes, sir.
- Fine. I'll talk to her.

715
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,585
Give me the phone, quick.

716
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,091
She's the only one
I'm gonna talk to.

717
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:36,136
- Awfully nice of you to show me around.
- l enjoy it.

718
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:39,232
The aquarium was swell. If l lived
in New York, I'd go every day.

719
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:40,901
l bet you do.

720
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:43,640
I'd like to,
but l have a job to think of.

721
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:46,814
You'd better
keep following that bus!

722
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:48,317
Keep your shirt on!

723
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:53,217
- Looks like no pictures tonight.
- Maybe l oughta get him drunk again.

724
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:57,556
Got any news? l mean, has anything
exciting been happening lately?

725
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,562
Sure. l met you.

726
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:03,629
What's happening about the opera?

727
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:07,535
Oh, that. We had another meeting.
l told 'em I'd go on being chairman if--

728
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:09,538
- I'm chairman, you know.
- Yeah, l know.

729
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:12,541
l told 'em I'd play along
if they lowered prices...

730
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:14,543
cut down expenses
and broadcast.

731
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:17,546
Oh. What'd they say?

732
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:19,548
Gee, you look pretty tonight.

733
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:21,846
- What'd they say?
- Huh? Oh.

734
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:26,083
They said l was crazy. They said
l wanted to run it like a grocery store.

735
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:28,090
What are they going to do?

736
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:31,423
Do you always wear your hair
like that?

737
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:34,726
Isn't it a scream?
"Cinderella Man." The dope.

738
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:36,789
Like to get my hooks
into that guy.

739
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:39,802
Don't worry. Someone's
probably taking him for plenty.

740
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,676
If they were men
I'd knock their heads together.

741
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:50,611
- Have you seen the papers?
- Uh-huh.

742
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:54,048
That's what I like about you.
You think about a man's feelings.

743
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:58,680
I'd like to punch the fella in the nose
that's writing that stuff.

744
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,753
"Cinderella Man."

745
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:04,760
Pretty soon everybody'll
be calling me Cinderella Man.

746
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:14,167
Would you like to walk the rest
of the way? It's so nice out.

747
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:16,172
- Yes.
- Yeah, let's.

748
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,081
Hey, wise guys, he's getting off.

749
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,641
Come on, pull up to the curb!

750
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:33,355
Oh, come on.
Don't you want to see it?

751
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:38,592
Well, feast your eyes.
Grant's tomb.

752
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:42,822
Is that it?

753
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,368
Hey, beetle puss.

754
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:46,663
The tomb.

755
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:53,675
Well, there you are. Grant's tomb.
l hope you're not disappointed.

756
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:57,510
- It's wonderful.
- To most people it's an awful letdown.

757
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:59,310
Huh?

758
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:02,318
I say, to most people it's a washout.

759
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:04,946
That depends on what they see.

760
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:07,456
- And what do you see?
- Me?

761
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:12,394
Oh, l see a small Ohio farm boy...

762
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:14,760
becoming a great soldier.

763
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,766
I see thousands of marching men.

764
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:22,204
I see General Lee,
with a broken heart, surrendering.

765
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:26,003
I can see the beginning of a new nation,
like Abraham Lincoln said.

766
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:31,141
And l can see that Ohio boy
being inaugurated as president.

767
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:36,853
Things like that can only happen
in a country like America.

768
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:40,389
Excuse me.

769
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:47,496
Sorry, Mr. Hopper.
Mr. Cedar won't answer his phone.

770
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:49,896
- What's going on in the boss's office?
- Search me.

771
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:52,902
The three C's and little "B"
have been in there over an hour.

772
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,904
l don't want to be critical, but--

773
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:57,907
Yes, l know. A week's gone by and
we haven't got power of attorney yet.

774
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:00,443
- Yes, but you said--
- l can't strangle him, can I?

775
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,206
It's ridiculous for us
to have to worry about a boy like that.

776
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,510
Look at these articles.
"Cinderella Man."

777
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:08,847
- He's carrying on like a idiot.
- Exactly what l was saying--

778
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:11,080
Who cares?

779
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:14,714
- Yeah?
- Mr. and Mrs. Semple are still waiting.

780
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,053
Let 'em wait.

781
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:18,151
They've been in
every day this week.

782
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,162
- Who are they?
- Relatives of old man Semple.

783
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,688
They keep insisting
they should have some nuisance value.

784
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:26,702
- Nuisance value?
- If not for Deeds, they'd be rich.

785
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,902
Nuisance value.

786
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:31,406
Maybe they have.

787
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,713
Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please.

788
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:40,511
How do you do?
I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting.

789
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:44,520
What was my secretary thinking,
keeping you waiting this long?

790
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:48,591
Will you have a cigar,
Mr. Semple?

791
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,092
Thanks.

792
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,327
- There's Times Square.
- You can almost spit on it, can't you?

793
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:54,830
Why don't you try?

794
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,734
It's breezy up here.

795
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:06,342
You're worried about those articles
they're writing about you, aren't you?

796
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,344
Oh, I'm not worrying anymore.

797
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:11,347
They'll go on writing 'em
until they get tired.

798
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:13,849
You don't believe all that stuff,
do you?

799
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:16,852
Oh, they just do it
to sell the newspapers, you know.

800
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,353
Yeah, l guess so.

801
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:21,914
What puzzles me is why people
seem to get so much pleasure...

802
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:24,324
out of hurting each other.

803
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:27,329
Why don't they try liking each other
once in a while?

804
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,193
Shall we go?

805
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,102
Here's a nice place.

806
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:43,272
Yeah. Anyway,
there aren't any photographers around.

807
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:52,350
You said something to me when you first
met me I've thought about a great deal.

808
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:55,983
- What's that?
- You said l was a lady in distress.

809
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:57,492
Oh. That.

810
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:00,359
- What did you mean by that?
- Nothing.

811
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:02,931
Have you got a--

812
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:08,003
Are you engaged or anything?

813
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:10,130
- No. Are you?
- No.

814
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:15,471
You don't go out
with girls very much, do you?

815
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:17,376
- l haven't.
- Why not?

816
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:19,244
Oh, I don't know.

817
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:23,582
You must've met a lot of society girls.
Don't you like them?

818
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:26,679
I haven't met anybody here
that l like particularly.

819
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:30,921
They all seem to have St. Vitus' Dance.
Except you, of course.

820
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:32,723
People here are funny.

821
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:36,391
They work so hard at living,
they forget how to live.

822
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:40,027
Last night, after I left you,
l was walking along...

823
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:42,264
and looking at the tall buildings...

824
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:45,536
and I got to thinkin'
about what Thoreau said--

825
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:48,043
"They created a lot
of grand palaces here...

826
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:51,911
but they forgot to create
the noblemen to put in them."

827
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:54,576
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.

828
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:59,285
- I'm from a small town too, you know.
- Really?

829
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:03,053
- Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
- What do you know about that!

830
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:05,617
It's a beautiful little town too.

831
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:08,095
Grove poplar trees
right along main street.

832
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:11,100
Always smells
as if it just had a bath.

833
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:13,363
- I've often thought about going back.
- You have?

834
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:15,064
Oh, yes.

835
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:20,940
I used to have a lot of fun there.
l loved going fishing with my father.

836
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:24,503
You know, that's funny.
He was a lot like you, my father was.

837
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,515
He talked like you too.

838
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:31,151
Sometimes he let me hold the line
while he smoked.

839
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,155
We'd just sit there for hours.

840
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:38,251
After a while, for no reason,
I'd go over, kiss him, sit in his lap.

841
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:42,594
He never said very much,
but once l remember him saying...

842
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:46,102
"No matter what happens, honey,
don't complain."

843
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:49,229
He sounds like a person
well worth knowing.

844
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:51,968
- He played in the town band too.
- He did?

845
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:53,976
- I play the tuba.
- Yeah, l know.

846
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:56,979
- What did he play?
- Drums. He taught me to play some.

847
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:59,345
- He did?
- Mm-hmm. l can do "Swanee River."

848
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:01,850
- Would you like to hear me?
- Sure.

849
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:06,521
Let's see, now.

850
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:12,861
Way down

851
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:15,830
Upon the Swanee River

852
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:18,766
Far, far away

853
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:24,297
There's where my heart
is going ever

854
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:27,935
There's where the old folks stay

855
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:33,473
Oh, l suppose you could do better.

856
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,848
Sure.
l can sing "Humoresque."

857
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:38,319
l bet you don't even know
how it goes.

858
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:41,915
Sure. You sing it over again,
and I'll do "Humoresque" with it.

859
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,084
You better be good.

860
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,220
l wonder if they want
to make it a quartet.

861
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:48,457
- Ready?
- Yeah.

862
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:52,628
Way down upon the Swanee River

863
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:55,637
Far, far away

864
00:52:56,907 --> 00:53:00,741
There's where my heart
is going ever

865
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:04,746
There's where the old folks stay

866
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:08,841
All the world is sad and dreary

867
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:13,322
Everywhere l go

868
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,221
Fire engines.

869
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:21,021
Fire engine! l wanna see how they do it.
Wait for me, will you?

870
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:23,292
Looks like the evening's
not gonna be wasted.

871
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,962
Hello. What do you want?

872
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:31,064
Captain Deeds, fire volunteer,
Mandrake Falls.

873
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:33,803
Hi, Cap.
Boys, meet the captain.

874
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:02,666
- What's the matter, hon?
- Nothing.

875
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,264
What's up, Babe?
Something's eatin' you.

876
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,833
No, it's nothing.

877
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,880
My unfailing instinct tells me
something's gone wrong with the stew.

878
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:13,780
Don't be ridiculous.

879
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:17,911
You haven't gotten very far, have you?
That's where you were an hour ago.

880
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:20,548
Let's knock off and go down to Joe's.
The gang's waitin' for us.

881
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:23,889
I can't write it, Mabel.
l don't know what's the matter with me.

882
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,393
Uh-uh.

883
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:33,367
Yeah, she's here.
Who wants her?

884
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:34,835
Who?

885
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:37,600
Oh, yes.
Yes, just a moment.

886
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:42,166
It's him. Whatchamacallit.
The Cinderella Man.

887
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:45,447
The Cinderella Man.

888
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:54,223
Couldn't sleep. Kind of wanted
to talk to you. Do you mind?

889
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,226
No, not at all.
I couldn't sleep either.

890
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:01,196
l wanted to thank you again
for going out with me.

891
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:02,959
Huh?

892
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:05,467
l don't know
what I'd do without you.

893
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:07,469
You've made up
for all the fakes I've met.

894
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:15,578
Well, that's very nice.
Thank you.

895
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,637
You know what I've been doin'
since l got home?

896
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:21,741
I've been workin' on a poem.

897
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,979
It's about you.

898
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:27,285
Sometimes it's kind of hard for me
to say things, so I write 'em.

899
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:30,150
I'd like to read it sometime.

900
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:32,717
Maybe I'll have it finished
next time I see you.

901
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:35,026
Will I see you soon?

902
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:38,192
Gosh, that's swell, Mary.
Good night.

903
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:39,701
Good night.

904
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:49,443
MabeI, that guy's either the dumbest,
most imbecilic idiot in the world...

905
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:51,104
or the grandest thing alive.

906
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,706
- l can't make him out.
- Uh-huh.

907
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:56,718
- I'm crucifying him.
- People have been crucified before.

908
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:58,720
Why do we have to do it?

909
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:00,722
You started out to be
a successful newspaperwoman.

910
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,657
- And then what?
- Search me. Ask the Gypsies.

911
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:06,127
Here's a guy
that's wholesome and fresh.

912
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,131
To us he looks like a freak.

913
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,724
Do you know
what he told me tonight?

914
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:15,862
When he gets married he wants to
carry his bride over the threshold.

915
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,305
The guy's balmy.

916
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,309
Is he?
Yeah, l thought so too.

917
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:23,312
I tried to laugh,
but it stuck in my throat.

918
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,816
Cut it out, will ya? You'll get me
thinking about Charlie again.

919
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,946
He's got goodness, Mabel.

920
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:34,080
Do you know what that is?

921
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:38,355
Of course you don't. We've forgotten.
We're too busy being smart alecks.

922
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:41,022
Too busy in a crazy
competition for nothing.

923
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,462
l beg pardon, sir.

924
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:53,675
- Madame Pomponi is on the telephone.
- Who?

925
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:56,678
Madame Pomponi. She says that everything
is all set for the reception.

926
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:59,681
- Don't come in here when I'm playing.
- But she's on the telephone, sir.

927
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:02,274
Get out.
The evil finger's on you.

928
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,786
- The finger, sir?
- Get out!

929
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,027
Stop!

930
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,035
- Did you hear that?
- What, sir?

931
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,075
Why, that's an echo, sir.

932
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:29,577
- You try it.
- Me, sir?

933
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:33,410
Louder.

934
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,389
- You try it.
- Me, sir?

935
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:44,492
Louder.

936
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:49,456
You try it.

937
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:54,296
All together.

938
00:57:57,941 --> 00:57:59,374
Again.

939
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,081
Let that be a lesson to you.

940
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:11,720
Go back to your rooms,
both of you.

941
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,860
Hello, darling.

942
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:04,202
- So good of you to come.
- Oh, Madame Pomponi.

943
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:08,711
- I'm so happy to have you here.
- I'm dying to see the Cinderella Man.

944
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:12,407
-Shh. He may hear you.
-Even if he did, he wouldn't understand.

945
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:13,847
Bad as that, eh?

946
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:15,851
I hear he still believes
in Santa Claus.

947
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:18,319
Will he be Santa Claus?
That's what l wonder.

948
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,322
Are your slippers ready
for the Cinderella Man?

949
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,858
- Think he'll go for that?
- Don't be bashful.

950
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:25,690
With 20 million dollars,
he doesn't have to have looks.

951
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:29,562
He won't have it long with
that Pomponi woman hanging around him.

952
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:33,466
My dears, l hear that he can't think
unless he plays his tuba.

953
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:35,265
You're a fool, Babe.

954
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:37,272
I just couldn't stand
seeing him again.

955
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:40,673
Running away is no solution.
What'll l tell him if he calls up?

956
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:44,679
Tell him I had to leave suddenly.
Got a job in China, someplace.

957
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:47,807
- You're acting like a schoolgirl.
- What else can l do?

958
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:50,910
Keeping this up's no good.
He's bound to find out sometime.

959
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:53,353
At least I can save him that.

960
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:57,958
- Where is everybody?
- Come on, Babe. The artillery's ready.

961
00:59:58,027 --> 01:00:00,325
It's those two sore spots again.

962
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:08,303
- Should've been down to the office.
- Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.

963
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:10,965
- Boy, was he burning.
- Just a minute. No, you don't.

964
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,565
Just one little drink,
and then we're ready to shoo.

965
01:00:13,643 --> 01:00:16,305
- We're not going out tonight.
- l thought you had a date with him.

966
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:18,904
It's off. He's having
a party at his house.

967
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:22,975
- Say, what's the matter with her now?
- You wouldn't know if l drew a diagram.

968
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:25,782
-Run along. Peddle your little tintypes.
-Say, what is this?

969
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:28,881
Throwing us out of here
is getting to be a regular habit.

970
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,862
Is Mary Dawson here?
I'm Longfellow Deeds.

971
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:38,957
Yes. Of course.
Longfellow Deeds.

972
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,997
Come in.
Step in, please.

973
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:48,305
You're Mabel, her sister,
aren't you?

974
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:50,505
Yes. Yes. Of course.
Her sister.

975
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:53,276
Yes, I've been her sister
a long time.

976
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:55,943
- Is she home?
- Yeah. What?

977
01:00:56,019 --> 01:01:00,513
- Is Mary home?
- Oh, Mary. Yes, of course.

978
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:04,959
I don't know whether she's home or not.
I'll see. There she is.

979
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:06,791
- Hello.
- Hello, Mary.

980
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:14,360
I waited in the park over an hour.
l thought maybe you'd forgotten.

981
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:17,031
l didn't think you could come,
with the party and everything.

982
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:20,200
I wouldn't let them stop me
from seeing you, so l threw them out.

983
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:23,672
- You threw them out?
- You mean, by the neck or something?

984
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:26,840
Sure. They got on my nerves,
so l threw them out.

985
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:31,785
That'll be in the papers tomorrow,
give them something else to laugh at.

986
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,618
l don't mind, though.
l had a lot of fun doing it.

987
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:38,149
- Would you like to go for a walk?
- Yeah, if it isn't too late.

988
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:40,161
I'll get my hat.

989
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:49,267
Nice day out--
Nice night, wasn't it-- isn't it?

990
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:53,502
Yes. Lovely.
Had a lot of nice weather lately.

991
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:57,239
Yeah. It'd be a nice night
to go for a walk, don't you think?

992
01:01:57,313 --> 01:02:01,977
Yeah, l think it'd be a swell night
to go for a walk. A nice long one.

993
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:06,420
- Ready?
- Gosh.

994
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:11,990
- She looks better every time I see her.
- Thank you.

995
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:16,121
Good night. Don't worry.
l won't keep her out late.

996
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:18,827
Thank you so much.
Good night.

997
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:24,631
- My foot's asleep.
- No, you don't.

998
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,074
- Listen, she told us--
- No more photographs.

999
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:38,310
Glad you wanted to take a walk, Mary,
'cause l wanted to talk to you.

1000
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:40,548
Let's just walk, hmm?

1001
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:43,853
All right.

1002
01:02:48,898 --> 01:02:52,334
Mary, I'm going home.

1003
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:53,868
Are you? When?

1004
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:56,302
A day or so, l think.

1005
01:02:57,373 --> 01:03:00,137
- l don't blame you.
- A man ought to know where he fits in.

1006
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:02,143
l just don't fit in around here.

1007
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:05,146
l once had an idea
l could do something with the money...

1008
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:08,479
but they kept me so busy
I haven't had time to figure it out.

1009
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:11,247
l guess I'll wait
till I get back home.

1010
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:26,098
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary?
You don't have to pay any attention.

1011
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:28,467
No, l don't mind.

1012
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:31,507
All my life
I've wanted somebody to talk to.

1013
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:36,068
Back in Mandrake Falls,
l used to always talk to a girl.

1014
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:38,875
- A girl?
- Only an imaginary one.

1015
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:42,440
l used to hike a lot through the woods,
and I'd always take this girl with me...

1016
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:44,452
so l could talk to her.

1017
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,580
I'd show her my pet trees and things.

1018
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:51,093
It sounds kind of silly,
but we had a lot of fun doing it.

1019
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,720
She was beautiful.

1020
01:03:53,796 --> 01:03:57,527
l haven't married,
'cause I've been kind of waiting.

1021
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:01,195
You know, my mother and father
were a great couple.

1022
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:04,262
I thought I might have
the same kind of luck.

1023
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:08,743
I've always hoped that someday
that imaginary girl...

1024
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:11,541
would turn out to be real.

1025
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:18,653
Well, here we are again.

1026
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:22,213
Yes, here we are again.
Good night.

1027
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:23,349
Good night.

1028
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:34,926
Excuse me.

1029
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:36,631
Good-bye, darling.

1030
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:41,541
Don't let anybody hurt you again, ever.
They can't anyway. You're much too real.

1031
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:45,047
You go back to Mandrake Falls.
It's where you belong.

1032
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:46,809
Good-bye.

1033
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:56,020
You know the poem l told you about?
It's finished.

1034
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:58,560
Would you like to read it?
It's to you.

1035
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:00,255
Yes. Of course.

1036
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:15,569
You don't have to say anything, Mary.
You can tell me tomorrow what you think.

1037
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:23,145
"l tramped the Earth
with hopeless feet...

1038
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:26,780
searching in vain
for a glimpse of you.

1039
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:30,485
Then heaven thrust you
at my very feet...

1040
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:34,552
a lovely angel,
too lovely to woo.

1041
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:43,427
My dream has been answered,
but my life's just as bleak.

1042
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:47,306
I'm handcuffed and speechless
in your presence divine.

1043
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:54,847
For my heart longs to cry out.
If it only could speak.

1044
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:59,115
I love you, my angel.
Be mine. Be mine."

1045
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:01,918
Oh, darling.

1046
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:12,532
You don't have to say anything now. I'll
wait till tomorrow to hear from you.

1047
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:28,614
What's the big idea?

1048
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,620
Stop it, Babe. Stop it.

1049
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:39,149
What do you mean, you're quitting?
You might as well tell me I'm quitting.

1050
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:42,061
What's bothering you?

1051
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:44,497
Last night
he proposed to me.

1052
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:47,502
Proposed to you?
You mean, he asked you to marry him?

1053
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:50,437
- Yes.
- Why, Babe! That's terrific!

1054
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:52,940
"Cinderella Man woos mystery girl.
Who is the myster--"

1055
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,239
Print one line of that
and I'll blow your place up.

1056
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:58,474
Sorry, Babe. Sorry.
l just got carried away.

1057
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:02,108
That's too bad.
That would've made a swell story.

1058
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:05,776
So, he proposed to you?

1059
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,415
What a twist.
You set out to nail him, and he--

1060
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:11,051
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?

1061
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:18,761
You haven't gone
and fallen for that mug, have you?

1062
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:25,172
Well, I'll be.
That's tough.

1063
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:30,270
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to tell him the truth.

1064
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:33,873
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him
you've been making a stooge out of him?

1065
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:38,414
I'm having lunch with him today.
He expects an answer.

1066
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:43,447
- It's going to be pretty.
- You're crazy. You can't do that.

1067
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:48,122
He'll probably kick me
right down the stairs. l hope he does.

1068
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:51,428
I'll put you on another job.
You need never see him again.

1069
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:55,937
That's the rub.

1070
01:07:57,339 --> 01:07:59,398
It's as bad as that?

1071
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:03,445
Telling him's the long shot.
I'm going to take it.

1072
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:12,345
Well, it was fun
while it lasted, Mac.

1073
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:15,681
I'll clean out my desk.

1074
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:28,430
- How's it going?
- Yes. Quite all right. Thank you, sir.

1075
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:30,563
- Gold?
- Yes, sir.

1076
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:35,343
- Fourteen karat.
- Yes, sir.

1077
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:37,879
- Is that the best you got?
- Yes, sir.

1078
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:42,046
Those flowers are too high.
l won't be able to see her.

1079
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:45,246
- Get a smaller bowl, will you?
- A smaller bowl of flowers, yes.

1080
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:48,154
- Yes, sir. A smaller bowl of flowers.
- Did you get that stuff?

1081
01:08:48,224 --> 01:08:50,988
- Stuff, sir?
- Yeah, that goo that tastes like soap.

1082
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:55,997
Yes, sir. Here it is.
The pate de foie gras, sir.

1083
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:57,532
That's fine.
Have a lot of it, 'cause she likes it.

1084
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,091
- Yes.
- Now you got the idea.

1085
01:09:00,169 --> 01:09:02,933
That's fine.
Sit over there, will you?

1086
01:09:03,005 --> 01:09:04,666
- Me, sir?
- Yeah.

1087
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:13,014
You're too tall.
Slink lower, will you?

1088
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:15,016
Yes.

1089
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:17,075
More.

1090
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:20,955
Now forward.

1091
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:24,419
How is this, sir?

1092
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:27,221
Perfect.

1093
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:29,025
l wish you luck, sir.

1094
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:34,733
Thank you. Now, don't touch a thing.
Leave everything as it is.

1095
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:37,797
Yes.

1096
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:53,386
- Where are you?
- What is it, sir? Anything happened?

1097
01:09:53,455 --> 01:09:55,719
"Anything happened?" l got to get
dressed. l can't meet her like this.

1098
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:59,318
- But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
- What's an hour? Time flies.

1099
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:01,659
- My tie?
- Yes, very good, sir.

1100
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,064
Yes, sir.

1101
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:08,763
Way down upon the Swanee River

1102
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:11,135
Just as I suspected,
wise guy.

1103
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:14,768
l don't mind you making a sap out of
yourself, but you made one of me too.

1104
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:17,209
Will you tell the gentleman
I'm not in?

1105
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:20,737
Mary Dawson, hmm?
Mary Dawson, my eye.

1106
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:24,274
That dame took you for a sleigh ride
New York will laugh about for years.

1107
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:27,652
She's the slickest two-timing,
double-crossing--

1108
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:30,214
- What are you talking about?
- Go ahead. Sock away.

1109
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:32,783
And then try
to laugh this off.

1110
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:42,199
She's the star reporter
on the Mail.

1111
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:45,604
Every time you opened your kisser,
you gave her another story.

1112
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:48,302
She's the dame who slapped that moniker
on you : Cinderella Man.

1113
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:50,470
You've been making love
to a double dose of cyanide.

1114
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:52,138
Shut up!

1115
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:09,228
Listen, Babe. l can't let you quit now.
Are you going through with this?

1116
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:11,892
This is for you, Mac.
Names of all the head waiters in town.

1117
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:15,459
You can always buy a better choice of
scandal from them at reasonable prices.

1118
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:18,836
I've seen them get in a rut like you
before, but they always come back.

1119
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:23,435
Hello? Yes?
Just a minute. It's for you.

1120
01:11:23,512 --> 01:11:25,946
A couple of weeks, you'll get the itch
so bad you'll be working for nothing.

1121
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:30,179
- Hello?
- Babe Bennett? Just a minute.

1122
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:37,186
- Hello, Mary?
- Hello, darling.

1123
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:39,853
Is it you who's been
writing those articles about me?

1124
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:44,592
Why, l was just leaving.
I'll be up there in a minute.

1125
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:52,574
Look-- Yes, I did,
but l was just coming up to explain.

1126
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:58,439
Listen, darling.
Wait a minute. Please.

1127
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:00,311
Listen.

1128
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:28,834
I beg pardon, sir. Should
l serve the wine with the squab, sir?

1129
01:12:28,911 --> 01:12:31,175
I beg pardon, sir?

1130
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:45,886
If l knew you were going to take it
so hard, I would've kept my mouth shut.

1131
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:47,553
Sorry.

1132
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:54,299
Pack my things, Walter.
I'm going home.

1133
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,100
Yes, sir.

1134
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:02,006
You shouldn't be running away like this.
What's going to happen to the estate?

1135
01:13:02,077 --> 01:13:04,011
They can have the estate.

1136
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:09,613
Nobody's going to kick me out.
Let me go!

1137
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:12,779
l want to see that guy!
Let me go!

1138
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:16,848
I want to see him!
There he is.

1139
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:19,723
l just want to get a look at him.
There you are.

1140
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:21,854
l just wanted to see
what kind of a man you were.

1141
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:24,728
l wanted to see what a man looked like
that could spend thousands on a party...

1142
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,734
while people around him were hungry.

1143
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:30,670
The Cinderella Man? Did you think
how many families could have been fed...

1144
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:32,673
on the money you pay out
to get on the front pages?

1145
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:34,800
- Let me alone!
- Let him alone.

1146
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:38,335
If you know what's good for you,
you'll let me get this off my chest.

1147
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:41,247
How did you feel
feeding donuts to a horse?

1148
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:43,910
Got a kick out of it?
Got a big laugh?

1149
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:47,183
Did you ever think of feeding donuts
to human beings? No!

1150
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,349
- Shall I call the police, sir?
- No!

1151
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,858
What do you want?

1152
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:53,520
Yeah, that's all that's worrying you:
What do l want?

1153
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:57,224
A chance to feed a wife and kids.
I'm a farmer. A job.

1154
01:13:57,299 --> 01:14:00,564
- That's what l want.
- A farmer? You're a moocher.

1155
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:03,503
l wouldn't believe you or anybody else
on a stack of Bibles.

1156
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:06,564
You're a moocher like all the rest
of them around here, so get out.

1157
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:08,576
Sure, everybody's a moocher to you.

1158
01:14:08,644 --> 01:14:12,375
A mongrel dog eating out of
a garbage pail is a moocher to you.

1159
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:15,281
- This won't do you any good.
- Stay where you are! Get over there!

1160
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:19,149
You're about to get
some more publicity, Mr. Deeds.

1161
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:21,849
You're about
to get on the front page again.

1162
01:14:21,924 --> 01:14:24,518
See how you're going
to like it this time.

1163
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:28,529
What good's your money when you're six
feet under? You never thought of that.

1164
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:32,260
All you ever thought of was pinching
pennies, you money-grabbing hick.

1165
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:36,430
You never gave a thought to all of those
starving people in the bread lines...

1166
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:38,598
not knowing where
their next meal was coming from...

1167
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:40,972
not able
to feed their wife and kids.

1168
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:42,977
Not able to--

1169
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:57,317
I'm glad l didn't hurt nobody.
Excuse me.

1170
01:14:57,392 --> 01:14:59,553
Crazy.

1171
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:02,825
You get all kinds
of crazy ideas.

1172
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:07,328
Sorry.

1173
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:09,996
l didn't know
what I was doing.

1174
01:15:10,072 --> 01:15:13,508
Losing your farm
after 20 years' work.

1175
01:15:13,575 --> 01:15:16,339
Seeing your kids go hungry.

1176
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:21,348
Game little wife saying
everything's going to be all right.

1177
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:24,879
Standing there in the bread lines.

1178
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:27,649
It killed me
to take a handout. l--

1179
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:29,657
l ain't used to it.

1180
01:15:30,459 --> 01:15:35,260
Go ahead and do
what you want with me, mister.

1181
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:39,824
l guess I'm
at the end of my rope.

1182
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:19,371
Could l take some of this
home with me?

1183
01:17:57,272 --> 01:17:59,001
- Are you married?
- Yes, sir.

1184
01:17:59,074 --> 01:18:01,167
- Any children?
- No children.

1185
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:03,871
All right, Mr. Dodsworth.
l think you'll qualify.

1186
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:06,140
Take this to that desk over there
for further instructions.

1187
01:18:06,214 --> 01:18:08,705
- Thank you very much.
- Next, please.

1188
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,483
- How many does that make?
- You've okayed 819.

1189
01:18:15,557 --> 01:18:17,252
- Is that all? It's going awfully slow.
- That's all.

1190
01:18:17,325 --> 01:18:19,452
We need 1,100 more.

1191
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:23,424
Hello? Yes. Yeah.

1192
01:18:23,498 --> 01:18:27,298
The water development seems okay.
l don't like the road layout.

1193
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:31,965
Come up tonight about 10:00
and bring the maps. Right.

1194
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:35,305
Here's the order for the plows.
We got a good price on them.

1195
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,641
That's fine. Thanks.
I'll look them over later.

1196
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:43,379
Mr. Deeds, my wife wanted me to tell you
she prays for you every night.

1197
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:46,546
l-- Well, thanks.

1198
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:50,391
- How do you do? What is your name?
- George Rankin, sir.

1199
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:53,792
No, no, we're not buying any bulls.
What's that?

1200
01:18:53,862 --> 01:18:57,662
Listen, fellow. Bull's
what I've been selling all my life.

1201
01:18:58,366 --> 01:19:01,460
We've little time. He's ordered me to
turn everything over to him immediately.

1202
01:19:01,536 --> 01:19:03,663
We have to work fast,
before he disposes of every penny.

1203
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:07,106
See, I told you something could be done.
l knew it all the time. Sign it, dear.

1204
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:10,044
- We may get into trouble.
- Don't be so squeamish.

1205
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:12,239
There's millions involved.
After all, you have your legal rights.

1206
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:14,874
- You're his only living relative.
- What's it say?

1207
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:17,180
That's your agreement with Mr. Cedar
in case we win.

1208
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:21,154
My end is going to be rather expensive.
l have important people to take care of.

1209
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:24,818
l have the legal machinery ready to go.
I've been working on nothing else.

1210
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:27,691
You say the word, and we'll
stop this yokel dead in his tracks.

1211
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:30,323
- Sign it!
- All right.

1212
01:19:30,398 --> 01:19:32,866
- Charlie, we're off. Papers all set?
- All set.

1213
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:34,595
- Go to it. Charlie?
- Yeah?

1214
01:19:34,669 --> 01:19:37,968
Find out who wrote those articles
and subpoena him right away.

1215
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:41,497
- So what is your name?
- Christian Swenson.

1216
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:45,308
- Farmer?
- Yes, ma'am.

1217
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:48,941
- Where is your farm?
- South Dakota, north.

1218
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:53,078
- South Dakota North?
- South Dakota, but on the top.

1219
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:57,752
- What about knocking off for lunch?
- Not hungry.

1220
01:19:57,826 --> 01:20:00,351
l want to get through this work
in a hurry, and then l want to go home.

1221
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:02,794
Come on. What are you
trying to do, keel over?

1222
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:06,197
You haven't been out of this house
in two weeks.

1223
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:09,135
Maybe I'll have a sandwich.
Do you mind waiting a few minutes?

1224
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:13,231
Sure. If you like
to have a sandwich...

1225
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:16,539
l can give you one, please.

1226
01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:19,503
Thanks. Thank you.

1227
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:22,106
Never mind, Cobb.

1228
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,415
Good.

1229
01:20:45,307 --> 01:20:47,867
- Get lunches for the rest of them.
- What?

1230
01:20:47,943 --> 01:20:50,844
There must be 2,000 of them
out there.

1231
01:20:50,912 --> 01:20:55,872
- That doesn't make them less hungry.
- Okay, Santa Claus. 2,000 lunches.

1232
01:21:06,561 --> 01:21:08,688
Say something.

1233
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:10,628
Go ahead. Tell him.

1234
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:15,261
Mr. Deeds, the boys here
wanted me to say a little something.

1235
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:17,430
They just wanted me to say that--

1236
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:21,600
They wanted me to say
that we think you're swell.

1237
01:21:21,676 --> 01:21:23,803
And that's no baloney.

1238
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:26,643
- Say something more.
- Give me a chance, fellows.

1239
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:31,049
We're all down and out. A fellow
like you comes along, it gives us hope.

1240
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:34,577
- Break it up. Get back.
- They just wanted me to say that I've--

1241
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,352
That's him.

1242
01:21:39,427 --> 01:21:41,486
- Are you Longfellow Deeds?
- Yes.

1243
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:44,964
Sheriff's office. We got a warrant
to take you into custody.

1244
01:21:45,033 --> 01:21:47,695
- A what?
- A warrant for your arrest.

1245
01:21:47,769 --> 01:21:49,999
- What's up? What do you wonks want?
- l don't know nothing.

1246
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:52,631
All l know is the sheriff
gives me an insanity warrant to execute.

1247
01:21:52,707 --> 01:21:54,971
Insanity?
Who says he's insane?

1248
01:21:55,043 --> 01:21:57,443
The complainant is a relative
of the late Martin Semple.

1249
01:21:57,512 --> 01:22:01,812
The charges are that Mr. Deeds is insane
and incapable of handling the estate.

1250
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:05,842
Somebody got panic-stricken? Where
do you think you're going to take him?

1251
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:08,014
- County Hospital.
- Of course, that's only temporary.

1252
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:10,387
The hearing
will follow immediately.

1253
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:13,052
That's fine.

1254
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:15,323
Just because I want to give this money
to people who need it...

1255
01:22:15,397 --> 01:22:17,865
they think I'm crazy.

1256
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:19,867
That's marvelous.

1257
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:23,632
- Let's get it going.
- Wait. We're going to get a lawyer.

1258
01:22:23,705 --> 01:22:25,263
- I'll call Cedar.
- Don't bother.

1259
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:28,741
I'm from Mr. Cedar's office.
He represents the complainant.

1260
01:22:30,145 --> 01:22:32,670
- Let's go. We're wasting time.
- All right. I'll go.

1261
01:22:32,747 --> 01:22:35,181
But get your hands off me.

1262
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:48,996
Come on. Get back.

1263
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:52,332
Step back.

1264
01:22:55,036 --> 01:22:56,970
Come on. Get back.

1265
01:23:02,677 --> 01:23:05,202
Boss, everybody in town
has been here to see him.

1266
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:09,944
Yes, sir. l will. Good-bye.
Sorry, lady. It's you again.

1267
01:23:10,018 --> 01:23:11,781
- Please. I've got to see him.
- Listen, sister.

1268
01:23:11,853 --> 01:23:14,151
For the 14th and last time,
he don't want to see nobody.

1269
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:16,452
- Will you just give him my name?
- Listen, toots.

1270
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:18,651
Just between us, there isn't a thing
in the world the matter with that guy...

1271
01:23:18,727 --> 01:23:20,888
till l mention your name;
then he goes haywire.

1272
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:30,004
What are you going to do?
Sit back and let them railroad you?

1273
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:34,531
It's as pretty a frame-up
as ever hit this rotten town.

1274
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:37,100
If you'd just
let me get you a lawyer.

1275
01:23:44,986 --> 01:23:48,786
You can't walk into that courtroom
without being ready to protect yourself.

1276
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:54,762
Cedar's too smart. With the talent he's
got lined up against you, you'll cook.

1277
01:23:54,829 --> 01:23:56,888
Listen, pal.
l know just how you feel.

1278
01:23:56,965 --> 01:23:59,798
A blonde in Syracuse
put me through the same paces.

1279
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:02,803
l came out with a sour puss,
but full of fight.

1280
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:05,738
Come on.
You don't want to lay down now.

1281
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:18,853
They're trying to prove you're nuts.
They'll shove you in the bug house.

1282
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,411
The moment they accused you of it,
they had you half licked.

1283
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:23,423
You've got to fight.

1284
01:24:35,236 --> 01:24:37,761
Go on.
Sit down, won't you? Yes.

1285
01:24:40,775 --> 01:24:42,766
So long, Mr. Cobb.

1286
01:24:42,844 --> 01:24:45,938
Corny, listen, I've got to see him.
I've got to talk to him.

1287
01:24:46,014 --> 01:24:48,676
Haven't you done
enough damage already?

1288
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:51,742
Somebody's got to help him.
He hasn't a chance against Cedar.

1289
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:55,984
I've been talking to everybody. I've got
Mac lined up and the paper's behind him.

1290
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:59,515
l can get Livingston too. With a lawyer
like Livingston, he's got a chance.

1291
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:02,427
You're wasting your time.
He doesn't want any lawyers.

1292
01:25:02,497 --> 01:25:06,194
He's so low, he doesn't want anybody's
help. You can take a bow for that.

1293
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:11,034
As swell a guy as ever hit this town and
you crucified him for some headlines.

1294
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:14,405
You've done your bit.
Now stay out of his way.

1295
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:06,917
There he is now.

1296
01:26:10,865 --> 01:26:12,833
Here he is.

1297
01:26:32,287 --> 01:26:34,721
Cedar just sent for me.
He wants to make a settlement.

1298
01:26:34,789 --> 01:26:38,520
Here's your chance to get out
of the whole mess. What do you say?

1299
01:26:43,498 --> 01:26:45,125
Rise, please.

1300
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:48,825
Supreme Court, State of New York,
County of New York now in session...

1301
01:26:48,903 --> 01:26:50,632
the Honorable Judge May presiding.

1302
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:52,639
Be seated.

1303
01:26:57,011 --> 01:27:01,345
The court wishes to warn those present
it will tolerate no disturbances.

1304
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:05,978
Regarding the sanity hearing
of Longfellow Deeds...

1305
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:09,655
You represented by counsel,
Mr. Deeds?

1306
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,768
l understand
you have no counsel.

1307
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:25,870
In fact, that you have no intention
of defending any of these charges.

1308
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:29,774
Now, if you wish to change your mind,
the hearing can be postponed.

1309
01:27:36,684 --> 01:27:37,776
Crazy.

1310
01:27:49,464 --> 01:27:50,829
Proceed.

1311
01:27:50,898 --> 01:27:53,992
In the interest of my client,
the only other living relative...

1312
01:27:54,068 --> 01:27:55,535
of the late Martin W. Semple...

1313
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:58,834
we cannot permit a fortune so huge
to be dissipated by a person...

1314
01:27:58,906 --> 01:28:02,569
whose incompetency and abnormality we
shall prove beyond any reasonable doubt.

1315
01:28:02,644 --> 01:28:06,102
I have before me a series of articles
written by a newspaperwoman...

1316
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:09,172
who was an eyewitness to this conduct
ever since he came to New York.

1317
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:11,684
She tells how in the midst
of a normal conversation...

1318
01:28:11,753 --> 01:28:14,051
he would suddenly
begin playing his tuba.

1319
01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:18,555
She tells of his attack upon several
of our eminent writers for no reason.

1320
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:22,722
l, myself, unable to keep pace with his
mental quirks and fearful of assault...

1321
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:25,425
turned down an opportunity
to represent him as his attorney.

1322
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:29,764
This newspaperwoman,
whom we have subpoenaed to testify...

1323
01:28:29,837 --> 01:28:34,433
tells how he held up traffic for an hour
feeding donuts to a poor horse.

1324
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:37,103
We have photographs
to substantiate this little episode.

1325
01:28:37,178 --> 01:28:40,204
Another photograph showing Mr. Deeds
jumping about a fire engine.

1326
01:28:40,281 --> 01:28:42,545
This scarcely sounds
like the action of a man...

1327
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:45,984
in whom the disposition of $20 million
may safely be entrusted.

1328
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:48,488
The writer of these articles,
a woman...

1329
01:28:48,556 --> 01:28:51,957
whose intelligence and integrity in
the newspaper world is unquestioned...

1330
01:28:52,026 --> 01:28:56,895
held him in such contempt that she quite
aptly named him the Cinderella Man.

1331
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:04,463
We have witnesses here
from Mandrake Falls...

1332
01:29:04,539 --> 01:29:08,066
his own hometown, who will tell of
his conduct throughout his lifetime...

1333
01:29:08,142 --> 01:29:12,101
proving that his derangement is
neither a recent nor a temporary one.

1334
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:15,616
We have others who will tell
of his unusual behavior...

1335
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:18,880
when he invited the great leaders
of the musical world to his home...

1336
01:29:18,953 --> 01:29:21,786
and then proceeded
to forcibly eject them.

1337
01:29:21,856 --> 01:29:23,983
- l hope he can explain that.
- Yes.

1338
01:29:24,058 --> 01:29:27,755
Only recently, when he was in
the County Hospital for observation...

1339
01:29:27,829 --> 01:29:31,925
he not only refused to be examined by
these gentlemen-- state psychiatrists--

1340
01:29:31,999 --> 01:29:34,695
but he actually made
a violent attack upon them.

1341
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:40,273
In these times, with the country
incapacitated by economic ailments...

1342
01:29:40,341 --> 01:29:42,935
and in danger with an undercurrent
of social unrest...

1343
01:29:43,010 --> 01:29:47,777
the promulgation of such a weird,
fantastic and impractical plan--

1344
01:29:47,849 --> 01:29:51,808
as contemplated by the defendant--
is capable of fomenting a disturbance...

1345
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:53,854
from which the country
may not soon recover.

1346
01:29:53,921 --> 01:29:56,981
It is our duty to stop it.

1347
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:03,094
Our government
is fully aware of its difficulties.

1348
01:30:03,164 --> 01:30:05,189
It can pull itself out
of its economic rut...

1349
01:30:05,266 --> 01:30:08,429
without the assistance of Mr. Deeds
or any other crackpot.

1350
01:30:08,503 --> 01:30:11,097
His attempted action
must therefore be attributed...

1351
01:30:11,172 --> 01:30:15,006
to a diseased mind, afflicted
with hallucinations of grandeur...

1352
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:18,637
and obsessed with an insane desire
to become a public benefactor.

1353
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:26,385
Your Honor, we would like to call our
first witness, Louise "Babe" Bennett.

1354
01:30:27,155 --> 01:30:28,952
Miss Bennett, please.

1355
01:30:43,838 --> 01:30:45,635
Raise your right hand, please.

1356
01:30:45,706 --> 01:30:49,335
Do you swear to tell the truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1357
01:30:49,410 --> 01:30:50,809
- l do.
- State your right name.

1358
01:30:50,878 --> 01:30:53,210
- Louise Bennett.
- Take the stand.

1359
01:30:55,483 --> 01:30:58,975
Miss Bennett,
are you employed by the Morning Mail?

1360
01:30:59,053 --> 01:31:02,887
- l ask you direct your attention to me.
- Your Honor, this is ridiculous.

1361
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:05,482
- Please answer the question.
- The whole hearing's ridiculous.

1362
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:08,393
- That man's no more insane than you.
- Outrageous!

1363
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:12,194
It's obviously a frame-up. They're
trying to railroad this man for money.

1364
01:31:12,266 --> 01:31:16,032
Young lady, another outburst like that,
and I shall hold you in contempt.

1365
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:19,834
We are not interested in your opinion of
this case. You are to here to testify.

1366
01:31:19,907 --> 01:31:22,034
Sit down and answer questions.
Proceed.

1367
01:31:22,109 --> 01:31:24,703
Thank you, Your Honor.
Are you employed by the Morning Mail?

1368
01:31:26,214 --> 01:31:29,240
You're under oath, Miss Bennett. Again,
are you employed by the Morning Mail?

1369
01:31:29,317 --> 01:31:31,046
l resigned last week.

1370
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:34,144
Prior to that time,
were you employed by the Morning Mail?

1371
01:31:34,222 --> 01:31:35,712
- Yes.
- Were you given an assignment...

1372
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:37,587
to follow the activities
of Longfellow Deeds?

1373
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:40,149
- Yes.
- Did you subsequently write about him?

1374
01:31:40,228 --> 01:31:42,492
- Yes.
- Are these the articles?

1375
01:31:42,563 --> 01:31:44,588
- Yes.
- Were you present?

1376
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:46,963
- Yes.
- Are they true? They did take place?

1377
01:31:47,034 --> 01:31:49,298
-They're colored to make him look silly.
-You saw them happen?

1378
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:50,462
- Yes, but--
- That's all.

1379
01:31:50,538 --> 01:31:52,472
It isn't all.
I'd like to explain.

1380
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:56,909
- I submit these articles as evidence.
- Let go! What kind of hearing is this?

1381
01:31:56,978 --> 01:31:59,105
What are you trying to do?
Persecute the man?

1382
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:01,410
He's not defending himself.
Somebody's got to do it.

1383
01:32:01,482 --> 01:32:03,541
- Please.
- I've got a right to be heard.

1384
01:32:03,618 --> 01:32:07,816
I've attended dozens of cases like this.
They're conducted without any formality.

1385
01:32:07,889 --> 01:32:11,689
Anybody can be heard. My opinion's
as good as these quack psychiatrists'.

1386
01:32:11,759 --> 01:32:14,125
I know him better than they do.

1387
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:16,663
If you have quite finished,
l should like to inform you...

1388
01:32:16,731 --> 01:32:19,564
that one more utterance from you,
and l shall place you under arrest.

1389
01:32:20,801 --> 01:32:22,735
I'm willing to hear
anything anyone has to say...

1390
01:32:22,803 --> 01:32:25,033
but I insist on it being done
in an orderly fashion.

1391
01:32:25,106 --> 01:32:27,734
When you have learned to show some
respect for this court, you may return.

1392
01:32:27,808 --> 01:32:30,902
Until then, you'd better
go back to your seat and calm down.

1393
01:32:30,978 --> 01:32:32,912
This way, miss.

1394
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:52,999
Order in the court.

1395
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:57,470
Mr. Deeds, have you anything to say
in defense of these articles?

1396
01:33:09,383 --> 01:33:11,317
Mark these Exhibit "A"
for the plaintiff.

1397
01:33:11,385 --> 01:33:13,319
Yes, Your Honor.

1398
01:33:15,856 --> 01:33:17,323
Proceed.

1399
01:33:17,758 --> 01:33:20,989
They're rather timid, Your Honor,
and wish to be together.

1400
01:33:21,062 --> 01:33:23,462
If the court pleases,
I'll only have one testify.

1401
01:33:23,531 --> 01:33:26,625
- Yes. Get on with it.
- What is your name, please?

1402
01:33:26,701 --> 01:33:30,728
- Jane Faulkner. This is my sister Amy.
- Yes. Amy.

1403
01:33:30,805 --> 01:33:33,205
I'll direct my questions
to you, Miss Jane.

1404
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:37,574
You may answer for both.
Do you know the defendant?

1405
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:44,410
Yes. Of course we know him.

1406
01:33:44,485 --> 01:33:46,919
How long have you known him?

1407
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:56,860
- Since he was born.
- Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.

1408
01:33:56,931 --> 01:34:00,560
- He was a seven-months baby.
- Thank you. That's fine.

1409
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:03,001
Do you see him very often?

1410
01:34:07,575 --> 01:34:09,702
- Most every day.
- Sometimes twice.

1411
01:34:09,777 --> 01:34:13,508
- Must we have the echo?
- Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane.

1412
01:34:13,581 --> 01:34:16,709
Will you tell the court what everybody
at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?

1413
01:34:25,793 --> 01:34:28,455
- They think he's pixilated.
- Yes. Pixilated.

1414
01:34:29,730 --> 01:34:32,665
- He's what?
- What was that you said he was?

1415
01:34:32,733 --> 01:34:36,760
- Pixilated.
- That's rather a strange word to us.

1416
01:34:36,837 --> 01:34:40,295
- Can you tell the court what it means?
- Perhaps l can explain, Your Honor.

1417
01:34:40,374 --> 01:34:42,638
The word "pixilated"
is an early-American expression...

1418
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:45,201
derived from the word "pixies,"
meaning "elves."

1419
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:50,216
They'd say, "The pixies had got him,"
as we'd nowadays say a man is "balmy."

1420
01:34:50,284 --> 01:34:52,718
Is that correct?

1421
01:34:55,222 --> 01:34:59,750
Why does everyone think he's pixilated?
Does he do peculiar things?

1422
01:34:59,827 --> 01:35:03,490
He walks in the rain without his hat
and talks to himself.

1423
01:35:03,564 --> 01:35:06,294
- Sometimes he whistles.
- And sings.

1424
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:08,562
Anything else?

1425
01:35:08,636 --> 01:35:11,696
- He gave Chuck Dillon a thumping.
- Blacked his eye.

1426
01:35:11,772 --> 01:35:14,900
- Why?
- For no reason, l guess.

1427
01:35:14,975 --> 01:35:19,207
He always does it. We run into the house
when we see him coming.

1428
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:21,475
Never can tell
what he's going to do.

1429
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:27,146
- He sure is pixilated.
- Yes. He's pixilated, all right.

1430
01:35:27,221 --> 01:35:29,689
Thank you, ladies.
That's all.

1431
01:35:30,791 --> 01:35:34,352
They kept hollering,
"Back to nature!"

1432
01:35:34,428 --> 01:35:37,761
I thought they looked harmless enough,
so l took them home.

1433
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:40,357
l never thought
he was cracked.

1434
01:35:41,102 --> 01:35:44,333
I'm a waiter. He kept pressing me
to point out the celebrities.

1435
01:35:44,405 --> 01:35:47,067
I said, "Help me." I'm coming out of
the kitchen a couple of minutes later...

1436
01:35:47,141 --> 01:35:49,132
and there he is
mopping up the floors with them.

1437
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:52,145
l never figured he was a guy
that was looking for trouble.

1438
01:35:52,213 --> 01:35:56,877
He threw us out bodily,
but bodily!

1439
01:35:56,951 --> 01:36:00,216
We was hired as his bodyguard, see?
The first crack out of the box...

1440
01:36:00,287 --> 01:36:02,221
he throws us in a room
and locks the door, see?

1441
01:36:02,289 --> 01:36:05,156
If a thing like that gets around
in our profession, we get the bird, see?

1442
01:36:05,226 --> 01:36:08,320
So l says to my partner,
"Let's quit this guy. He's nuts!"

1443
01:36:08,395 --> 01:36:12,092
I'm very fond of Clarissa.
She's a nice horse.

1444
01:36:12,166 --> 01:36:14,566
And when this bloke here
started feeding her donuts...

1445
01:36:14,635 --> 01:36:18,901
l yelled down to him,
"Mind what you're doing down there."

1446
01:36:18,973 --> 01:36:22,704
l wouldn't mind, sir, but Clara
won't eat nothin' but donuts now.

1447
01:36:23,744 --> 01:36:26,907
And now, if the court pleases,
l shall call upon Dr. Emil Von Hallor...

1448
01:36:26,981 --> 01:36:29,347
if he'll be good enough
to give us his opinion.

1449
01:36:29,416 --> 01:36:31,281
Dr. Von Hallor
is the eminent Austrian psychiatrist...

1450
01:36:31,352 --> 01:36:33,718
probably the greatest authority
on the subject in the world.

1451
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:35,779
At present, he's in this country
on a lecture tour...

1452
01:36:35,856 --> 01:36:37,483
and has graciously
volunteered his services.

1453
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:46,293
Do you swear the testimony you give
in the cause now before this court...

1454
01:36:46,367 --> 01:36:48,892
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1455
01:36:48,969 --> 01:36:51,597
- State your right name, please.
- Emil Von Hallor.

1456
01:36:51,672 --> 01:36:52,900
Take the stand.

1457
01:36:56,811 --> 01:37:01,339
Dr. Von Hallor, would you tell the court
what your opinion is of this case?

1458
01:37:01,415 --> 01:37:04,407
This is purely a case
of manic depression.

1459
01:37:04,485 --> 01:37:08,444
A case of this kind,
patients sometimes go on for years...

1460
01:37:08,522 --> 01:37:10,649
before being detected.

1461
01:37:10,724 --> 01:37:12,692
You remember, Dr. Fosdick,
in my last book...

1462
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:16,924
there were some very fine examples,
especially the young nobleman.

1463
01:37:16,997 --> 01:37:20,865
- You remember?
- Yes, Dr. Von Hallor. Very interesting.

1464
01:37:20,935 --> 01:37:23,927
It reminds me very much of this one.

1465
01:37:24,004 --> 01:37:25,995
It takes so long to detect them...

1466
01:37:26,073 --> 01:37:30,169
because their mood
changes so often and so quickly.

1467
01:37:30,244 --> 01:37:34,010
Now, Your Honor, may l show you?
May I use the chart?

1468
01:37:34,081 --> 01:37:36,015
By all means.

1469
01:37:41,822 --> 01:37:45,189
Below here,
they are extremely depressed...

1470
01:37:45,259 --> 01:37:50,060
melancholy, impossible to live with
and often become violent.

1471
01:37:51,131 --> 01:37:53,258
From this mood...

1472
01:37:53,334 --> 01:37:57,430
the manic depressive
might gradually change...

1473
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:01,133
until they reach this state.

1474
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:06,407
Here is lucidity. Here they are
normal, as normal as you or I.

1475
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:09,574
Assuming, of course,
that we are normal.

1476
01:38:10,284 --> 01:38:13,185
Then the mood changes again...

1477
01:38:13,254 --> 01:38:16,417
until they reach this state...

1478
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:18,890
a state of highest exultation.

1479
01:38:18,959 --> 01:38:22,622
Here, everything is fine.
Here, the world is beautiful.

1480
01:38:22,696 --> 01:38:25,859
Here, they are so elated--
How to express it?

1481
01:38:25,933 --> 01:38:28,163
They would give you
the shirts off their backs.

1482
01:38:29,737 --> 01:38:32,535
How would you say
that applied to Mr. Deeds' case?

1483
01:38:32,606 --> 01:38:35,166
The symptoms are obvious.

1484
01:38:35,242 --> 01:38:38,143
When he was here,
on top of the wave...

1485
01:38:38,212 --> 01:38:42,342
he felt nothing but kindliness
and warmth for his fellow man.

1486
01:38:42,416 --> 01:38:47,115
He wanted to have them around him,
so he decided to give a big reception.

1487
01:38:47,187 --> 01:38:50,179
But in the meantime,
his mood has changed.

1488
01:38:50,257 --> 01:38:54,717
He's now at the bottom of the wave:
depressed, melancholy.

1489
01:38:54,795 --> 01:38:57,889
So when his guests arrive,
he throws them out.

1490
01:38:57,965 --> 01:39:00,297
They are now
his imaginary enemies.

1491
01:39:00,367 --> 01:39:03,495
Other instances
of high elations are...

1492
01:39:03,570 --> 01:39:08,769
when he plays his tuba,
when he writes his poetry...

1493
01:39:08,842 --> 01:39:12,471
when he chases fire engines
in a desire to help humanity.

1494
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:16,543
This is contrasted
with his present mood...

1495
01:39:16,617 --> 01:39:22,078
which is so low that even the instinct
for self-preservation is lacking.

1496
01:39:24,058 --> 01:39:28,722
Your Honor, this is decidedly
a case of manic depression.

1497
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:30,730
Thank you very much, Doctor.

1498
01:39:34,201 --> 01:39:36,669
Your Honor, we rest.

1499
01:39:42,076 --> 01:39:44,476
What are you going to do,
let them get away with it?

1500
01:39:44,545 --> 01:39:46,445
They've got you cooked.

1501
01:39:54,455 --> 01:39:56,923
He's sunk.

1502
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:09,732
Before the court arrives at a decision,
isn't there anything you wish to say?

1503
01:40:22,216 --> 01:40:24,741
Come on. Don't be a sap.

1504
01:40:38,232 --> 01:40:40,166
- You both concur?
- Absolutely.

1505
01:40:40,234 --> 01:40:41,428
All right.

1506
01:40:46,874 --> 01:40:51,902
In view of the extensive testimony,
your continued silence...

1507
01:40:51,979 --> 01:40:54,743
and on the recommendation
of the doctors...

1508
01:40:54,815 --> 01:40:58,581
the court considers it advisable,
for your own safety...

1509
01:40:58,652 --> 01:41:00,779
that you be committed
to an institution...

1510
01:41:00,854 --> 01:41:03,220
as prescribed by law.

1511
01:41:06,393 --> 01:41:09,294
You need medical attention,
Mr. Deeds.

1512
01:41:09,363 --> 01:41:12,628
Perhaps in a little while--

1513
01:41:14,168 --> 01:41:17,365
Wait a minute. You can't do it.
You've got to make him talk.

1514
01:41:17,438 --> 01:41:21,704
- Your Honor, l object.
- Please. l know how horrible I've been.

1515
01:41:21,775 --> 01:41:24,608
No matter what happens-- if you
never see me again-- do this for me.

1516
01:41:24,678 --> 01:41:26,407
- Please.
- You said l could speak.

1517
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:29,040
You said I could have my say
if l were rational. I'm rational.

1518
01:41:29,116 --> 01:41:30,811
Please let me
take the witness chair.

1519
01:41:30,884 --> 01:41:33,717
He must be made to defend himself
before you arrive at a decision.

1520
01:41:33,787 --> 01:41:35,652
- Take the stand.
- Thank you.

1521
01:41:35,722 --> 01:41:37,690
Your Honor, what she is saying
has no bearing on the case. l object.

1522
01:41:37,758 --> 01:41:40,090
- Let her speak.
- l know why he won't defend himself.

1523
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:43,095
That has a bearing on the case,
hasn't it? He's been hurt.

1524
01:41:43,163 --> 01:41:46,428
He's been hurt by everybody he's met
since he came here, principality by me.

1525
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:49,060
He's been the victim
of every conniving crook in town.

1526
01:41:49,136 --> 01:41:52,503
The newspapers pounced on him, made him
a target for their feeble humor.

1527
01:41:52,573 --> 01:41:56,771
l was smarter than the rest of them.
I got closer so l could laugh louder.

1528
01:41:56,844 --> 01:41:59,438
Why shouldn't he keep quiet?
Every time he said anything...

1529
01:41:59,513 --> 01:42:01,674
it was twisted around
to sound imbecilic.

1530
01:42:01,748 --> 01:42:04,740
He can thank me for it.
l handed the gang a grand laugh.

1531
01:42:04,818 --> 01:42:06,877
It's a fitting climax
to my sense of humor.

1532
01:42:06,954 --> 01:42:09,684
- Your Honor, this is preposterous.
- Certainly l wrote those articles.

1533
01:42:09,756 --> 01:42:12,418
l was going to get a raise,
a month's vacation.

1534
01:42:12,493 --> 01:42:15,485
But l stopped writing them when
I found out what he was all about...

1535
01:42:15,562 --> 01:42:17,393
when l realized how real he was.

1536
01:42:17,464 --> 01:42:20,592
He could never fit in
with our distorted viewpoint...

1537
01:42:20,667 --> 01:42:23,659
because he's honest
and sincere and good.

1538
01:42:23,737 --> 01:42:26,001
If that man's crazy...

1539
01:42:26,073 --> 01:42:28,507
the rest of us
belong in straitjackets!

1540
01:42:28,575 --> 01:42:30,509
This is absurd.
The woman's obviously in love with him.

1541
01:42:30,577 --> 01:42:32,772
- What's that got to do with it?
- You are in love with him, aren't you?

1542
01:42:32,846 --> 01:42:34,473
- What's that got to do with it?
- You are, aren't you?

1543
01:42:34,548 --> 01:42:37,642
- Yes!
- Her testimony's of no value.

1544
01:42:37,718 --> 01:42:40,050
Why shouldn't she defend him?
It's typical of American womanhood.

1545
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:41,678
Protect the weak.

1546
01:42:41,755 --> 01:42:44,918
I'm not saying nobody likes the boy.
I have a fond affection for him myself.

1547
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:49,019
- But that doesn't mean to say--
- I can verify what Miss Bennett said.

1548
01:42:49,096 --> 01:42:53,055
I'm her editor. When she quit, she told
me what a swell fellow this man was...

1549
01:42:53,133 --> 01:42:55,363
and anything Babe Bennett says
is okay with me.

1550
01:42:55,435 --> 01:42:57,596
If you have anything to say,
you will take the stand.

1551
01:42:57,671 --> 01:43:01,698
I've already said it, Your Honor. I just
thought I'd like to get my two cents in.

1552
01:43:01,775 --> 01:43:04,073
Don't be a sucker, pal.
Stand up and speak your piece.

1553
01:43:04,144 --> 01:43:07,136
-Your Honor, I've got a couple of cents.
-Sit down.

1554
01:43:07,214 --> 01:43:09,273
I've been with this man
ever since he came to New York.

1555
01:43:09,349 --> 01:43:11,817
Sit down ! There will be
no further interruptions.

1556
01:43:11,885 --> 01:43:14,877
- How about us, Mr. Deeds?
- Yes, what about us, Mr. Deeds?

1557
01:43:14,955 --> 01:43:17,549
- Order in the court!
- You're going to leave us in the cold?

1558
01:43:17,624 --> 01:43:19,421
They're trying to frame you.

1559
01:43:26,366 --> 01:43:27,890
- Stop this.
- Order!

1560
01:43:34,007 --> 01:43:35,599
Order.

1561
01:43:38,545 --> 01:43:42,003
In the interest of Mr. Deeds, l have
tolerated a great deal of informality.

1562
01:43:42,749 --> 01:43:45,843
But if there is one more outburst,
l shall have the courtroom cleared.

1563
01:43:47,754 --> 01:43:50,120
- Your Honor?
- Yes?

1564
01:43:50,190 --> 01:43:52,624
I'd like to get in
my two cents' worth.

1565
01:43:55,662 --> 01:43:56,959
Take the stand.

1566
01:44:26,093 --> 01:44:28,584
Proceed.

1567
01:44:28,662 --> 01:44:33,224
I don't know where to begin. There have
been so many things said about me that--

1568
01:44:36,103 --> 01:44:41,097
About my playing the tuba. It seems like
a lot of fuss has been made about that.

1569
01:44:41,174 --> 01:44:44,610
If a man's crazy
just because he plays the tuba...

1570
01:44:44,678 --> 01:44:46,441
then somebody'd
better look into it...

1571
01:44:46,513 --> 01:44:49,641
because there are a lot of tuba players
running around loose.

1572
01:44:49,716 --> 01:44:53,846
I don't see any harm in it. l play mine
whenever l want to concentrate.

1573
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:56,081
That may sound funny
to some people...

1574
01:44:56,156 --> 01:44:58,624
but everybody does something silly
when they're thinking.

1575
01:44:58,692 --> 01:45:01,593
For instance,
the judge here...

1576
01:45:01,662 --> 01:45:03,323
is an "O" filler.

1577
01:45:03,397 --> 01:45:04,887
- A what?
- An "O" filler.

1578
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:07,729
You fill in all the spaces in the O's
with your pencil. l was watching.

1579
01:45:15,809 --> 01:45:17,902
That may make you
look a little crazy, Your Honor...

1580
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:19,969
just sitting around,
filling in O's...

1581
01:45:20,047 --> 01:45:23,414
but l don't see anything wrong,
'cause that helps you think.

1582
01:45:23,483 --> 01:45:26,043
- Other people are doodlers.
- Doodlers?

1583
01:45:26,119 --> 01:45:28,087
Yeah, that's a name
we made up back home...

1584
01:45:28,155 --> 01:45:31,488
for people who make foolish designs
on paper when they're thinking.

1585
01:45:31,558 --> 01:45:34,686
It's called doodling.
Almost everybody's a doodler.

1586
01:45:34,761 --> 01:45:37,594
Did you ever see a scratch pad
in a telephone booth?

1587
01:45:37,664 --> 01:45:41,623
People draw the most idiotic pictures
when they're thinking.

1588
01:45:41,702 --> 01:45:45,570
Dr. Von Hallor here could probably
think up a long name for it...

1589
01:45:45,639 --> 01:45:47,869
because he doodles all the time.

1590
01:45:53,947 --> 01:45:55,574
Thank you.

1591
01:45:56,650 --> 01:46:00,450
This is a piece of paper
he was scribbling on.

1592
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:03,455
I can't figure it out.
One minute it looks like a chimpanzee.

1593
01:46:03,523 --> 01:46:08,256
The next minute it looks like a picture
of Mr. Cedar. You look at it.

1594
01:46:14,935 --> 01:46:16,994
Exhibit "A" for the defense.

1595
01:46:20,407 --> 01:46:23,001
Looks kind of stupid, doesn't it?
But l guess that's all right.

1596
01:46:23,076 --> 01:46:25,909
If Dr. Von Hallor has to doodle
to help him think...

1597
01:46:25,979 --> 01:46:28,004
that's his business.

1598
01:46:28,081 --> 01:46:32,211
Everybody does something different.
Some people are ear pullers.

1599
01:46:32,285 --> 01:46:34,719
Some are nail biters.

1600
01:46:34,788 --> 01:46:37,256
That Mr. Semple over there...

1601
01:46:37,324 --> 01:46:40,122
is a nose twitcher.

1602
01:46:45,899 --> 01:46:49,426
The lady next to him
is a knuckle cracker.

1603
01:47:03,583 --> 01:47:08,247
So you see, everybody does silly things
to help them think.

1604
01:47:08,321 --> 01:47:10,551
Well, l play the tuba.

1605
01:47:10,624 --> 01:47:13,457
- Nice work, toots!
- Order in this court!

1606
01:47:13,527 --> 01:47:16,291
This is becoming farcical.
l demand Mr. Deeds...

1607
01:47:16,363 --> 01:47:19,059
dispense with side remarks
and confine himself to facts.

1608
01:47:19,132 --> 01:47:21,896
Let him explain his wanderings
around the street in his underclothes...

1609
01:47:21,968 --> 01:47:23,663
his feeding donuts to horses.

1610
01:47:23,737 --> 01:47:26,069
Please. Proceed.

1611
01:47:29,176 --> 01:47:33,510
Mr. Cedar's right. Those things
do look kind of bad, don't they?

1612
01:47:33,580 --> 01:47:38,108
But to tell you the truth,
Your Honor, l don't remember them.

1613
01:47:38,185 --> 01:47:40,517
l guess they happened,
because I don't think a policeman...

1614
01:47:40,587 --> 01:47:44,455
would lie about a thing like that,
but l was drunk.

1615
01:47:44,524 --> 01:47:48,483
It was the first time l was ever drunk.
It's probably happened to you some time.

1616
01:47:49,963 --> 01:47:51,988
l mean,
when you were younger, of course.

1617
01:47:53,834 --> 01:47:55,563
It's likely
to happen to anybody.

1618
01:47:55,635 --> 01:47:58,729
Just the other morning, I read in
the paper about Mr. Cedar's own son...

1619
01:47:58,805 --> 01:48:03,265
how he got drunk and insisted on driving
a taxicab while the driver sat inside.

1620
01:48:09,115 --> 01:48:10,673
Isn't that so?

1621
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:15,518
- Your Honor, l object.
- Proceed.

1622
01:48:17,824 --> 01:48:20,122
Now, about the Faulkner sisters.

1623
01:48:20,193 --> 01:48:26,098
That's funny, Mr. Cedar going to
Mandrake Falls to bring them here.

1624
01:48:26,166 --> 01:48:28,634
- Do you mind if l talk to them?
- Not at all.

1625
01:48:30,504 --> 01:48:33,098
Who owns the house
you live in?

1626
01:48:37,077 --> 01:48:40,740
- Why, you own it, Longfellow.
- Yes, you own it.

1627
01:48:41,715 --> 01:48:44,684
- Do you pay any rent?
- No, we don't pay any rent.

1628
01:48:44,751 --> 01:48:46,548
Good heavens, no.

1629
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:49,384
- We never pay rent.
- Are you happy there?

1630
01:48:49,456 --> 01:48:51,890
- Oh, yes.
- Yes, indeed.

1631
01:48:52,626 --> 01:48:57,290
Now, Jane, a little while ago
you said l was pixilated.

1632
01:48:57,364 --> 01:48:59,798
Do you still think so?

1633
01:49:03,670 --> 01:49:06,571
Why, you've always been pixilated,
Longfellow.

1634
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:08,904
- Always.
- That's fine.

1635
01:49:09,943 --> 01:49:11,808
I guess maybe l am.

1636
01:49:11,878 --> 01:49:17,339
Now, tell me something, Jane.
Who else in Mandrake Falls is pixilated?

1637
01:49:17,417 --> 01:49:21,820
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls
is pixilated, except us.

1638
01:49:34,968 --> 01:49:37,402
Now, just one more question.

1639
01:49:38,538 --> 01:49:41,336
You see the judge here.
He's a nice man, isn't he?

1640
01:49:44,010 --> 01:49:46,478
- Do you think he's pixilated?
- Yes.

1641
01:49:46,546 --> 01:49:48,741
Yes, indeed.

1642
01:50:02,228 --> 01:50:06,028
You haven't yet touched
upon the most important point:

1643
01:50:06,099 --> 01:50:10,399
this rather fantastic idea of yours
to give away your entire fortune.

1644
01:50:10,470 --> 01:50:12,870
It is, to say the least,
most uncommon.

1645
01:50:12,939 --> 01:50:15,908
Yes. Yes, I was getting to that,
Your Honor.

1646
01:50:15,976 --> 01:50:18,911
Suppose you were living in a small town
and getting along fine...

1647
01:50:18,979 --> 01:50:22,813
and suddenly somebody
dropped $20 million in your lap.

1648
01:50:22,882 --> 01:50:25,715
Supposing you discover all that money
was messing up your life...

1649
01:50:25,785 --> 01:50:29,551
was bringing vultures around your neck
and making you lose faith in everybody.

1650
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:31,250
You'd be worried, wouldn't you?

1651
01:50:31,324 --> 01:50:36,318
You'd feel that you had a hot potato
in your hand, and you'd want to drop it.

1652
01:50:36,396 --> 01:50:40,833
l guess Dr. Von Hallor here would say
you were riding on those bottom waves...

1653
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:44,301
because you wanted to drop something
that was burning your fingers.

1654
01:50:44,371 --> 01:50:47,135
If this man is permitted to carry out
his plan, repercussions will be felt...

1655
01:50:47,207 --> 01:50:50,142
that will rock the foundation
of our entire governmental systems.

1656
01:50:50,210 --> 01:50:54,613
Please, Mr. Cedar.
Proceed.

1657
01:50:58,518 --> 01:51:01,783
Personally, l don't know
what Mr. Cedar is raving about.

1658
01:51:01,855 --> 01:51:04,255
From what l can see, no matter
what system of government we have...

1659
01:51:04,324 --> 01:51:07,259
there'll always be leaders
and always be followers.

1660
01:51:07,327 --> 01:51:10,091
It's like the road out in front
of my house. It's on a steep hill.

1661
01:51:10,163 --> 01:51:12,495
Every day,
I watch the cars climbing up.

1662
01:51:12,565 --> 01:51:16,467
Some go lickety-split up that hill
on high; some have to shift into second.

1663
01:51:16,536 --> 01:51:19,903
Some sputter and shake
and slip back to the bottom again.

1664
01:51:19,973 --> 01:51:23,534
Same cars, same gasoline,
yet some make it and some don't.

1665
01:51:23,610 --> 01:51:28,013
l say the fellows who can make the hill
should stop and help those who can't.

1666
01:51:28,081 --> 01:51:31,949
That's all I'm trying to do: help
fellows who can't make the hill on high.

1667
01:51:32,018 --> 01:51:33,952
What does Mr. Cedar
expect me to do with it?

1668
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:36,750
Give it to him and a lot of other people
who don't need it?

1669
01:51:36,823 --> 01:51:40,259
If you don't mind, Your Honor, I'll
ride on those top waves for a minute.

1670
01:51:40,326 --> 01:51:43,659
All you fellows up there, all those
who applied for a farm, stand up.

1671
01:51:47,434 --> 01:51:49,493
See all those fellows?
They're the ones I'm trying to help.

1672
01:51:49,569 --> 01:51:54,097
They need it. Mr. Cedar and Mr. Semple
don't need anything. They've got plenty.

1673
01:51:54,174 --> 01:51:56,642
It's like I'm out in a big boat,
and I see one fellow in a rowboat...

1674
01:51:56,710 --> 01:52:00,407
who's tired of rowing and wants
a free ride and another who's drowning.

1675
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:05,179
Who would you expect me to rescue?
Mr. Cedar, who wants a free ride?

1676
01:52:05,251 --> 01:52:07,344
Or those men out there
who are drowning?

1677
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:11,754
Any ten-year-old child will give you
the answer to that. Thank you. Sit down.

1678
01:52:14,294 --> 01:52:16,353
Now, my plan was very simple.

1679
01:52:16,429 --> 01:52:19,592
l was gonna give each family 10 acres,
a horse, a cow and some seed...

1680
01:52:19,666 --> 01:52:22,032
and if they worked the farm
for three years, it's theirs.

1681
01:52:22,102 --> 01:52:26,129
Now, if that's crazy, maybe
l ought to be sent to an institution...

1682
01:52:26,206 --> 01:52:29,607
but I don't think it is,
and Mr. Cedar doesn't either.

1683
01:52:29,676 --> 01:52:33,942
Before the hearing, he offered to call
everything off if l made a settlement.

1684
01:52:34,013 --> 01:52:37,005
So you see, he wouldn't think
I was crazy if he got paid off.

1685
01:52:37,083 --> 01:52:39,745
It's a lie growing
in his warped imagination.

1686
01:52:39,819 --> 01:52:42,287
I never heard anything
so colossally stupid in my life.

1687
01:52:42,355 --> 01:52:45,552
It's an insult to our intelligence to
sit and listen to such childish ravings.

1688
01:52:45,625 --> 01:52:48,025
- You will permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
- But, Your Honor--

1689
01:52:52,766 --> 01:52:55,758
- Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
- No.

1690
01:52:55,835 --> 01:52:59,737
Yes. There is one more thing I'd like
to get off my chest before l finish.

1691
01:52:59,806 --> 01:53:02,274
- Proceed.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1692
01:53:06,546 --> 01:53:08,707
Order! Order this man
back to his chair!

1693
01:53:15,889 --> 01:53:17,481
Order!

1694
01:53:27,567 --> 01:53:30,798
Remain seated and come to order.
The court is again in session.

1695
01:53:36,409 --> 01:53:38,400
Before the court
announces its decision...

1696
01:53:38,478 --> 01:53:41,003
l want to warn all who are here
that the police have orders...

1697
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:43,776
to arrest
anyone creating a disturbance.

1698
01:53:45,852 --> 01:53:50,482
Mr. Deeds, there has been a great deal
of damaging testimony against you.

1699
01:53:51,257 --> 01:53:53,316
Your behavior,
to say the least, has been...

1700
01:53:53,393 --> 01:53:55,623
most strange.

1701
01:53:55,695 --> 01:53:58,459
But in the opinion of the court,
you are not only sane...

1702
01:53:58,531 --> 01:54:01,159
but you are the sanest man
that ever walked into this courtroom.

1703
01:54:02,035 --> 01:54:04,503
Case dismissed.

1704
01:54:13,379 --> 01:54:15,472
You nose twitcher.

1705
01:54:15,548 --> 01:54:18,608
I knew it. You--

1706
01:55:04,931 --> 01:55:08,833
- He's still pixilated.
- He sure is.
