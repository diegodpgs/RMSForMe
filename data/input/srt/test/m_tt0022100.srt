1
00:00:01,277 --> 00:00:05,326
Fritz Lang's M was approved
by the Berlin Film Censorship Office

2
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:09,187
in a 117-minute version
on April 27, 1931,

3
00:00:09,431 --> 00:00:13,446
and received its premiere
on May 11, 1931.

4
00:00:13,691 --> 00:00:19,182
The film was rereleased in a shortened
98-minute version in March of 1960

5
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:23,982
under the title
M, Dein Mörder sieht Dich an.

6
00:00:24,226 --> 00:00:28,952
The original negative is preserved
at the Federal Film Archive

7
00:00:29,192 --> 00:00:33,447
in a 96-minute version.

8
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:37,303
Whenever possible,
missing scenes were filled in

9
00:00:37,546 --> 00:00:41,470
using prints from the same period
from the Cinematheque Suisse

10
00:00:41,706 --> 00:00:46,500
and the Netherlands Film Museum.

11
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,167
In its present form,
the film runs 109 minutes.

12
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:55,495
The film was restored in 2000
by the Netherlands Film Museum

13
00:00:55,732 --> 00:00:58,740
in collaboration
with the Federal Film Archive,

14
00:00:58,985 --> 00:01:01,730
the Cinematheque Suisse,

15
00:01:01,972 --> 00:01:04,717
KirchMedia and ZDF/ARTE,

16
00:01:04,957 --> 00:01:07,634
with funding
from the Mondriaan Foundation.

17
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:10,485
Laboratory: L'Immagine Ritrovata, Bologna.

and Martin Sawyer Sound Services, London.

20
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,120
Just you wait, it won't be long

21
00:01:57,395 --> 00:02:02,466
The man in black will soon be here

22
00:02:02,884 --> 00:02:07,515
With his cleaver's blade so true

23
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:11,887
He'll make mincemeat out of you!

24
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,620
You're out.

1
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,120
Just you wait, it won't be long

25
00:02:19,395 --> 00:02:24,466
The man in black will soon be here

26
00:02:24,884 --> 00:02:29,515
With his cleaver's blade so true

27
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:33,887
He'll make mincemeat out of you!

28
00:02:34,165 --> 00:02:34,358
You're out.

29
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:37,786
I told you to stop singing
that awful song!

30
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:40,540
Didn't you hear me?

31
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:46,170
That same cursed song over and over!

32
00:03:08,946 --> 00:03:12,781
Dear me, that's heavy.

33
00:03:33,763 --> 00:03:35,222
What's the matter?

34
00:03:36,141 --> 00:03:39,351
I told those kids to stop
singing that awful song,

35
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:41,979
but they sing it all day long.

36
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,483
As if we haven't heard
enough of that murderer already.

37
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,234
Ah, leave 'em alone.

38
00:03:46,486 --> 00:03:48,695
As long as we can hear 'em singing,

39
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:51,156
at least we know
they're still there.

40
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:54,534
Yes, I guess you're right.

41
00:04:26,027 --> 00:04:27,903
PUBLIC SCHOOL

42
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,929
10,000 MARKS' REWARD -
WHO IS THE MURDERER?

43
00:05:32,097 --> 00:05:35,601
"Little Kurt Klawitzky and his sister Klara
have been missing since June 11th.

44
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,604
Evidence leads us to believe
the children were victims of a crime

45
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:42,149
similar to that committed
last fall against the Doering siblings."

46
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:51,200
What a pretty ball you have there.

47
00:05:54,413 --> 00:05:56,247
What's your name?

48
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,500
Elsie Beckmann.

49
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,531
Didn't Elsie come with you?

50
00:06:29,783 --> 00:06:33,119
No, she didn't.

51
00:06:54,518 --> 00:06:56,185
Pretty!

52
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:05,529
Thank you.

53
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:20,044
A thrilling new chapter, Mrs. Beckmann.
Passionate and moving.

54
00:07:21,797 --> 00:07:23,798
Just a moment, Mr. Gehrke.

55
00:07:26,553 --> 00:07:28,220
Tell me, Mr. Gehrke.

56
00:07:29,347 --> 00:07:31,265
Have you seen little Elsie?

57
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:34,518
No. Didn't she just
come up the stairs?

58
00:07:34,893 --> 00:07:37,730
No, she's not home yet.

59
00:07:37,897 --> 00:07:40,607
She won't be long now.
Good-bye.

60
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:43,402
Good-bye, Mr. Gehrke.

61
00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:25,136
Extra! Extra!

62
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:32,435
Extra! Extra!

63
00:09:49,912 --> 00:09:53,373
No, I can't give change!
Extra!

64
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,794
Makes you afraid
to send your kids to school!

65
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:02,258
Who is the murderer?

66
00:10:06,598 --> 00:10:10,183
"Because the police
did not publish my first letter,

67
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,688
I am writing now
directly to the press!

68
00:10:15,773 --> 00:10:18,025
Proceed with your investigations.

69
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:22,071
All will soon be confirmed.

70
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,914
But I'm not done yet!"

71
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:33,458
10,000 marks' reward.

72
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:36,461
- Christ, here we go again!
- This is horrible!

73
00:10:39,381 --> 00:10:41,509
The print's too small.
We can't read it.

74
00:10:41,635 --> 00:10:44,136
You in front, read it out loud!

75
00:10:45,972 --> 00:10:48,098
- Let him read!
- Hey! Quiet!

76
00:10:48,308 --> 00:10:51,478
"The terror in our town
has found a new victim."

77
00:10:51,729 --> 00:10:54,355
Louder!
We can't hear a word!

78
00:10:54,606 --> 00:10:58,025
"Certain evidence leads us to believe

79
00:10:58,276 --> 00:11:00,779
that this is the same murderer

80
00:11:01,197 --> 00:11:04,366
who has already claimed eight victims
from among our city's children.

81
00:11:04,742 --> 00:11:07,536
We must emphasize once again

82
00:11:07,745 --> 00:11:10,957
that it is, now more than ever,
every mother and father's sacred duty

83
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,461
to alert their children
to this ever present danger

84
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:21,467
and to the friendly guise
it is likely to assume.

85
00:11:21,802 --> 00:11:24,929
A little candy, a toy, or an apple

86
00:11:25,347 --> 00:11:29,476
can suffice to lure a child
to his or her doom."

87
00:11:29,936 --> 00:11:31,812
Very true!

88
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:35,023
Keep reading.

89
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:39,361
"Anxiety among the 
general public is heightened

90
00:11:39,612 --> 00:11:45,367
by the police's failure
to apprehend a suspect.

91
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,330
But the police are faced
with the almost impossible task

92
00:11:49,498 --> 00:11:54,002
of catching a criminal who left
not the slightest clue behind.

93
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:56,505
Who is the murderer?'

94
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:58,173
What does he look like?

95
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,675
Where is he hiding?

96
00:12:00,884 --> 00:12:04,263
No one knows him, yet he is among us.

97
00:12:04,514 --> 00:12:07,850
Anybody sitting next to you
could be the murderer."

98
00:12:10,854 --> 00:12:13,356
Yes, that's very true.

99
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:17,027
- Why look at me when you say that?
- You know very well.

100
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,571
What do I know very well?

101
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,533
Think about it.
It'll come to you.

102
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,369
What are you saying?

103
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:31,751
I saw you follow that little girl
from the fourth floor up the stairs.

104
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,086
You're crazy, you dirty swine!

105
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:37,381
Who's the swine?
Me, or a man who chases little girls?

106
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:40,718
You bastard! You swine!

107
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,596
Murderer!

108
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:44,764
Gentlemen!

109
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:49,226
I'll see you in court!

110
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,897
I'll have you locked up!

111
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,903
Slanderer!
Trying to ruin my reputation!

112
00:12:58,071 --> 00:13:01,282
Damn slanderer!
Besmirching a man's good name!

113
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,534
And the police fall for it!

114
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:05,411
A search warrant!

115
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,038
How awful! What a disgrace!

116
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:10,375
Searching a man's house
based on an anonymous letter!

117
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:15,421
Mr. Jäger, please calm down.
We're only doing our job.

118
00:13:15,756 --> 00:13:19,593
As if it weren't enough that we're 
in constant fear for our kids!

119
00:13:19,803 --> 00:13:23,931
You see? That's why the police
must follow up every lead.

120
00:13:24,391 --> 00:13:27,142
Any man on the street
could be the murderer.

121
00:13:29,604 --> 00:13:31,772
Can you please tell me
what time it is?

122
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,440
Yes, my child.

123
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:44,119
Now you must hurry home.
Where do you live?

124
00:13:44,662 --> 00:13:47,164
What's it to you
where the kid lives?

125
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:50,750
Excuse me?

126
00:13:50,876 --> 00:13:52,627
What do you want with that kid?

127
00:13:53,754 --> 00:13:56,298
Absolutely nothing!

128
00:13:56,508 --> 00:13:58,718
What do you want with me?

129
00:13:58,969 --> 00:14:00,594
I'll show you what I want!

130
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:04,307
Let me go!
This is an outrage!

131
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,476
- What's going on?
- This is an outrage!

132
00:14:06,686 --> 00:14:09,396
- What does Four-Eyes want?
- Don't get so excited.

133
00:14:09,564 --> 00:14:12,607
- First chatting up children...
- Punch him in the face!

134
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:14,234
then acting like a big shot!

135
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,321
Will you let me go!
I didn't even speak to the child!

136
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:21,366
- Get her alone, eh?
- And kill her like the others, right?

137
00:14:21,617 --> 00:14:24,620
- He's the murderer!
- Hold him!

138
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,080
Call the police!

139
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:30,418
- Never around when you need 'em!
- Officer!

140
00:14:33,131 --> 00:14:36,549
Make way, gentlemen.
Let us through.

141
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,346
Sure, you can catch pickpockets!
Why don't you catch the murderer instead!

142
00:14:41,473 --> 00:14:43,640
What? Is he the murderer?

143
00:14:45,393 --> 00:14:46,894
Break it up!
Come on, move along!

144
00:14:47,145 --> 00:14:49,313
- The murderer!
- The monster!

145
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:52,192
Get him!

146
00:14:53,861 --> 00:14:55,862
Tackle him!

147
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,119
MURDERER WRITES TO THE PRESS

148
00:15:03,871 --> 00:15:07,624
"Because the police
did not publish my first letter,

149
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,045
I am writing now
directly to the press!

150
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:13,130
Proceed with your investigations.

151
00:15:13,256 --> 00:15:16,467
All will soon be confirmed.

152
00:15:16,593 --> 00:15:18,595
But I'm not done yet!"

153
00:15:21,556 --> 00:15:23,933
This is a terrible scandal!

154
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:28,814
Imagine the effect such a note
will have on the public, Commissioner!

155
00:15:29,065 --> 00:15:32,234
This is simply irresponsible!

156
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:37,406
Mr. Secretary, we cannot stop the murderer
from writing to whomever he wishes!

157
00:15:38,492 --> 00:15:42,744
This severely pathological man
probably takes great pleasure

158
00:15:42,912 --> 00:15:46,290
in seeing his crimes
covered in the press.

159
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:50,044
We immediately got in touch
with the newspaper

160
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,547
and had them send us
the original letter.

161
00:15:52,673 --> 00:15:54,924
The lab's working on it right now.

162
00:15:55,175 --> 00:16:00,681
Of course, you can't get good
fingerprints from a postcard

163
00:16:00,807 --> 00:16:03,516
that's passed
through so many hands.

164
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:06,311
Nevertheless,
we will leave no stone unturned.

165
00:16:06,437 --> 00:16:09,565
We'll painstakingly compare
the results against our archives

166
00:16:09,691 --> 00:16:14,863
in hopes of finding something
that can be used to solve this case.

167
00:16:15,114 --> 00:16:17,615
Then we'll send the letter
to our graphologist.

168
00:16:18,784 --> 00:16:23,497
"The aforementioned diamond-shaped
and swelling sweeps,

169
00:16:24,207 --> 00:16:30,253
clearly seen in the word 'soon,'
third line from the bottom..."

170
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:32,338
- You got that?
- Yes.

171
00:16:32,674 --> 00:16:38,971
"...attest to the strongly pathological
sexuality of this sex offender.

172
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:40,472
Period.

173
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:47,647
The partially disrupted and uneven style
of his other letters

174
00:16:48,148 --> 00:16:51,067
is, in its interpretation,

175
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:54,654
a form of acting

176
00:16:54,906 --> 00:17:01,329
which may manifest externally
as indolence or even lethargy.

177
00:17:03,665 --> 00:17:06,375
The writing as a whole displays

178
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:12,506
elusive yet unmistakable signs

179
00:17:12,925 --> 00:17:15,676
of madness."

180
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,682
Yes, of course, Commissioner.

181
00:17:20,934 --> 00:17:25,187
I have no doubt you're doing your job,
and your men as well.

182
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:27,689
But we need results!

183
00:17:27,941 --> 00:17:29,525
Results!

184
00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:36,907
Mr. Secretary, my men haven't gotten
12 hours' sleep in an entire week!

185
00:17:37,451 --> 00:17:41,245
My riot squads
don't get a moment's peace.

186
00:17:41,455 --> 00:17:46,585
They report for duty almost more fatigued
than when they were dismissed,

187
00:17:47,087 --> 00:17:51,382
because the painstaking nature
of their work wears on the nerves,

188
00:17:51,591 --> 00:17:56,303
and 80%-- if not 90%--
of our leads are false.

189
00:17:56,638 --> 00:17:59,723
The homicide squad doesn't even
get time to change clothes.

190
00:17:59,975 --> 00:18:04,228
They're constantly on call,
always tense and alert,

191
00:18:04,562 --> 00:18:06,856
ever ready to spring into action,

192
00:18:06,983 --> 00:18:09,859
to follow even the slightest lead,

193
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:12,737
as it just might be
the one that solves the case.

194
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:16,574
Mr. Secretary, just consider
the search of the crime scene.

195
00:18:18,077 --> 00:18:20,203
To give you an example:

196
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:25,167
In the bushes
just behind a picket fence,

197
00:18:25,627 --> 00:18:31,632
a small, white, crumpled
paper wrapping was found.

198
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:35,429
It apparently once contained
inexpensive sweets.

199
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:38,472
In the outermost corner

200
00:18:38,598 --> 00:18:41,600
were found traces of fruit drops

201
00:18:41,852 --> 00:18:44,938
and particles of powdered sugar.

202
00:18:46,065 --> 00:18:48,275
We've tried to trace the origin
of this wrapper

203
00:18:48,401 --> 00:18:53,906
in every candy shop and grocery store
within a radius of a mile and a half,

204
00:18:54,742 --> 00:18:56,409
but all to no avail.

205
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,620
With each passing day
we expand the area searched.

206
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:07,879
But, of course,
after such a long time,

207
00:19:08,005 --> 00:19:12,134
no one remembers anything
that could serve as a lead.

208
00:19:13,303 --> 00:19:16,472
Despite all these setbacks,

209
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:21,186
we're forced to press on
in our investigation,

210
00:19:21,312 --> 00:19:22,936
always in uncertainty,

211
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:26,148
and with little chance of success

212
00:19:26,357 --> 00:19:30,236
in bringing the case
even one step closer to its conclusion.

213
00:19:30,362 --> 00:19:31,654
Our men are doing everyth...

214
00:19:31,822 --> 00:19:34,199
What good is all this?

215
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,535
Commissioner,
I'm aware you're not dawdling,

216
00:19:37,661 --> 00:19:41,540
but that doesn't change the fact
that an unknown killer

217
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:45,502
is terrorizing 4½ million people!

218
00:19:45,628 --> 00:19:47,588
And the police are getting nowhere!

219
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:53,219
Mr. Secretary, you don't seem
to have a clear picture

220
00:19:53,345 --> 00:19:58,016
of the enormous obstacles
confronting our forces.

221
00:19:58,684 --> 00:20:00,352
Do you realize, for example,

222
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,898
regarding the route
the child took home,

223
00:20:05,274 --> 00:20:10,445
that there are 15 conflicting
eyewitness accounts alone?

224
00:20:10,613 --> 00:20:13,156
Let me give you a random example:

225
00:20:13,407 --> 00:20:17,286
"Testimony 1,478
in the Beckmann murder case..."

226
00:20:17,412 --> 00:20:19,455
- You've got no clue.
- More than you, mister!

227
00:20:19,581 --> 00:20:22,166
Gentlemen!

228
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:26,338
You must at least know the color
of the cap the little girl wore

229
00:20:26,464 --> 00:20:29,215
whom you say you saw
with the stranger!

230
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:31,217
Of course, Inspector.
It was red!

231
00:20:31,385 --> 00:20:34,346
- It was green!
- Red!

232
00:20:38,393 --> 00:20:41,395
Stop! This is pointless!

233
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:44,816
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- You're welcome!

234
00:20:45,401 --> 00:20:46,901
Next witness.

235
00:20:47,236 --> 00:20:50,613
If you rely
on a color-blind man for clues,

236
00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:53,116
don't be surprised
if you get nowhere!

237
00:20:53,242 --> 00:20:56,077
In their hunt
for this unknown killer,

238
00:20:56,328 --> 00:21:00,748
the police have tracked down
more than 1,500 detailed leads.

239
00:21:01,168 --> 00:21:05,045
The files in this case
fill 60 thick volumes.

240
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,089
We've dispatched all our forces

241
00:21:07,257 --> 00:21:09,884
to systematically comb
the area adjoining the city.

242
00:21:10,428 --> 00:21:13,596
Every piece of undergrowth is scoured,
every thicket searched,

243
00:21:13,763 --> 00:21:15,514
every bush examined,

244
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,934
since any bush or hollow
could harbor some object

245
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,396
that could finally set us
on the right track.

246
00:21:22,356 --> 00:21:24,191
We called in police dogs.

247
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:27,068
We set the best trackers
on the faintest of traces,

248
00:21:27,195 --> 00:21:28,737
but they lost the scent

249
00:21:28,864 --> 00:21:31,115
and failed to pick it up again
despite all efforts.

250
00:21:31,783 --> 00:21:33,201
Since the first murders,

251
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:36,995
the police have searched
homeless shelters night after night,

252
00:21:37,246 --> 00:21:39,957
subjecting everyone in them
to thorough scrutiny.

253
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,711
This does not, of course,
make the police very popular,

254
00:21:43,837 --> 00:21:46,130
nor does it reduce
the general public's anxiety.

255
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:51,261
Railway stations are kept
under surveillance around the clock.

256
00:21:51,471 --> 00:21:55,474
Still, the investigation has not yet
yielded the slightest results,

257
00:21:55,642 --> 00:21:59,686
nor have nightly raids
in the criminal districts.

258
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,077
The cops!

259
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:49,595
Get back!

260
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:52,723
- Back!
- This is the police!

261
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:03,651
Let me go, you dirty bastard!

262
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:06,697
Let me go, you son of a bitch!

263
00:24:07,115 --> 00:24:10,283
Goddamn bastard!

264
00:24:11,744 --> 00:24:13,828
Put me down!

265
00:24:14,163 --> 00:24:15,956
Let me go!

266
00:24:16,124 --> 00:24:17,958
Let her go, you filthy pig!

267
00:24:21,046 --> 00:24:22,880
Quiet!

268
00:24:23,006 --> 00:24:24,256
Move back!

269
00:24:24,383 --> 00:24:26,385
The top fuzz!

270
00:24:27,553 --> 00:24:29,388
Quiet!

271
00:24:29,514 --> 00:24:31,473
Police orders:

272
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:34,810
Nobody is to leave this establishment.
Get your papers ready.

273
00:24:44,488 --> 00:24:45,988
Please!

274
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,621
Come now, children,
stop this foolishness.

275
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:55,665
Well, if it isn't Tubby Lohmann!

276
00:25:07,262 --> 00:25:09,638
Quiet!

277
00:25:11,225 --> 00:25:12,725
That'll get you nowhere.

278
00:25:12,852 --> 00:25:15,687
- Go after the murderer instead!
- Right!

279
00:25:19,983 --> 00:25:21,025
Quiet!

280
00:25:22,027 --> 00:25:25,530
Be reasonable now!
Step back!

281
00:25:26,282 --> 00:25:28,199
You hear me? Step back!

282
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:31,871
Let's go!
Come on, let's see those papers!

283
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:34,957
- I haven't got any.
- Let's see your papers.

284
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,376
Please let me go, Inspector!

285
00:25:37,627 --> 00:25:40,546
The two guys who tried to escape
were caught on the Krangasse.

286
00:25:40,797 --> 00:25:42,882
- Leave those chairs alone!
- Shut up!

287
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:44,425
Have your papers ready!

288
00:25:44,593 --> 00:25:46,093
Haven't we met before?
- Yeah. So?

289
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,805
Off to the precinct again!

290
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,183
Haven't even made a buck tonight!

291
00:25:53,936 --> 00:25:56,897
Anyone without papers
goes down to the precinct!

292
00:25:57,064 --> 00:26:01,067
I tell you, I'm innocent, really!

293
00:26:01,194 --> 00:26:02,444
Stop talking nonsense!

294
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:04,404
- Let's get moving!
- Kiss my ass!

295
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,658
- Show your papers!
- Where's the paddy wagon?

296
00:26:07,784 --> 00:26:09,452
Don't push.

297
00:26:09,745 --> 00:26:11,579
Everyone will get their turn.

298
00:26:11,747 --> 00:26:13,956
- Silence!
- Cool it, kids!

299
00:26:14,082 --> 00:26:15,374
Have your papers ready!

300
00:26:16,586 --> 00:26:17,628
Your papers.

301
00:26:17,754 --> 00:26:20,839
Inspector, I can't carry my birth
certificate around with me everywhere!

302
00:26:20,965 --> 00:26:23,591
- Quit your bellyaching, child.
- I really can't, Inspector!

303
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:25,219
The precinct for you!

304
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,095
You make me puke!

305
00:27:15,815 --> 00:27:18,650
Shoddy work, my friend.

306
00:27:19,277 --> 00:27:21,320
You've been had.

307
00:27:21,989 --> 00:27:24,490
- Precinct.
- See you, Willy. Ta-ta!

308
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,076
Ah, lay off!

309
00:27:27,202 --> 00:27:28,369
Next.

310
00:27:30,831 --> 00:27:32,331
Stuck-up snob.

311
00:27:49,393 --> 00:27:51,019
What's wrong?

312
00:27:51,227 --> 00:27:54,187
- Papa Lohmann...
- ...nabbed him!

313
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,695
UNSOLVED BURGLARY AT FURRIER'S

314
00:28:04,033 --> 00:28:06,242
We'd better take you
down to the precinct too.

315
00:28:06,368 --> 00:28:10,205
What do you mean?
My papers are in order.

316
00:28:10,332 --> 00:28:11,415
Move on.

317
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:12,666
Move on!

318
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:14,000
Ah, tough luck!

319
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:15,501
Next.

320
00:28:18,673 --> 00:28:20,924
- Papers.
- Don't got none.

321
00:28:21,051 --> 00:28:22,384
To the precinct.

322
00:28:22,552 --> 00:28:24,261
Just my luck.

323
00:28:24,512 --> 00:28:26,264
Next, come on.

324
00:29:40,511 --> 00:29:42,136
You're ruining my business, Sarge.

325
00:29:42,387 --> 00:29:44,221
These raids every night.

326
00:29:44,681 --> 00:29:47,808
No one can get a moment's peace!
They're human beings too.

327
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:49,769
You think...

328
00:29:50,146 --> 00:29:54,149
we stay up all night
just for the hell of it?

329
00:29:54,316 --> 00:29:55,400
No.

330
00:29:55,526 --> 00:29:57,318
But you're drivin' away my clientele,

331
00:29:57,486 --> 00:30:00,239
and you won't find the guy
you're lookin' for here anyway.

332
00:30:01,658 --> 00:30:05,326
If you knew how steamed they are

333
00:30:05,578 --> 00:30:07,580
at the guy who's causing these raids.

334
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:09,540
Especially the girls.

335
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:12,376
Sure, they solicit.
Business is business.

336
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:15,713
But believe me,

337
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:19,134
in every one of them
beats a mother's heart!

338
00:30:19,343 --> 00:30:21,511
I know a lot of toughs

339
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,474
who get all teary-eyed
just seein' the little ones at play.

340
00:30:25,934 --> 00:30:30,020
If they ever get their hands
on that monster,

341
00:30:30,146 --> 00:30:32,022
they'll make toothpicks out of him!

342
00:30:32,565 --> 00:30:34,483
Ready to leave, Sergeant.

343
00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:35,985
So long.

344
00:30:46,498 --> 00:30:48,998
They hit the Crocodile Club today.

345
00:30:50,209 --> 00:30:51,876
Two paddy wagons.

346
00:30:57,717 --> 00:31:00,052
What's keeping Safecracker?

347
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:05,225
Is it 3:00 yet?

348
00:31:05,392 --> 00:31:07,101
I'll find out.

349
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,734
The exact time, please, miss.

350
00:31:15,778 --> 00:31:18,279
2:58. Thank you.

351
00:31:36,216 --> 00:31:39,760
2:58.

352
00:32:08,251 --> 00:32:11,503
The cops are crawling
the streets like ants again.

353
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:15,048
Green coats wherever you spit.

354
00:32:15,174 --> 00:32:17,676
They're on your back
even if you're with a broad.

355
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:20,721
They've gone nuts...
got this murderer on the brain.

356
00:32:21,264 --> 00:32:25,183
My old lady has a little six-year-old girl,
and every night I have to check

357
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:29,105
under the bed to see
if the murderer's hiding there.

358
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:33,067
You can't do business anymore
for tripping over cops everywhere.

359
00:32:33,277 --> 00:32:37,156
There's no privacy anymore.
I'm fed up with it.

360
00:32:38,033 --> 00:32:39,949
What else is new?

361
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:49,126
- Where the heck is Safecracker?
- Think they might have nabbed him?

362
00:32:49,586 --> 00:32:51,837
That guy? Come on.

363
00:32:52,005 --> 00:32:57,177
Scotland Yard laid a trap for him once
on a bank job he pulled in London.

364
00:32:57,345 --> 00:33:00,847
There he was, hands up,
back to the wall,

365
00:33:01,139 --> 00:33:04,267
cops all around him.

366
00:33:04,936 --> 00:33:07,354
Seconds later there were
three men dead on the ground,

367
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:09,439
but he wasn't one of 'em!

368
00:33:09,565 --> 00:33:12,150
No one better
from Berlin to San Francisco.

369
00:33:12,568 --> 00:33:15,821
They've been after him six years
and they've yet to get him.

370
00:33:15,948 --> 00:33:18,574
Not yet. But put enough dogs
on the fox's tail...

371
00:33:18,825 --> 00:33:20,534
Can it!

372
00:33:29,127 --> 00:33:30,294
Damn it!

373
00:33:32,256 --> 00:33:33,966
I can't take this!

374
00:33:35,134 --> 00:33:37,302
He was always right on time before.

375
00:33:40,391 --> 00:33:42,392
- Thank God!
- Finally.

376
00:33:44,478 --> 00:33:46,144
Morning!

377
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,605
Are you nuts?
Close those blinds!

378
00:34:11,673 --> 00:34:14,466
Gentlemen,
I hereby open this meeting.

379
00:34:14,592 --> 00:34:18,930
I declare all division leaders
of this organization present.

380
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,933
I assume you're authorized
to make binding decisions

381
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:24,769
for your divisions.

382
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,774
Good. We'll dispense
with the preliminaries,

383
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,317
as we all know why we're here.

384
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:36,449
An outsider is ruining
our business and our reputation.

385
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,160
Measures taken by the police

386
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:43,748
and the daily raids
to catch this child murderer

387
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:47,586
are hampering our activities
to an almost unbearable degree.

388
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:50,464
We can no longer tolerate the fact

389
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:55,677
that we're not safe now in any hotel,
bar, café or even private home

390
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:58,305
from the clutches of the police.

391
00:34:58,431 --> 00:34:59,514
Very true.

392
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,767
This state of affairs must end.

393
00:35:01,893 --> 00:35:05,563
Things must return to normal
or we'll go under.

394
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:09,317
Our coffers will soon be depleted.

395
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:12,904
If we can't get funds to support
the wives of those members

396
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:16,657
who currently enjoy
room and board at state expense,

397
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:22,456
I don't know where we'll find
the money to carry out our plans.

398
00:35:22,624 --> 00:35:24,666
Our reputation is suffering as well.

399
00:35:24,834 --> 00:35:27,669
The police seek
the murderer in our fold.

400
00:35:29,005 --> 00:35:32,050
Gentlemen, when I run head-on
into an officer from the squad,

401
00:35:32,176 --> 00:35:34,719
he knows the potential risks,
and so do I.

402
00:35:35,012 --> 00:35:38,180
If either dies in the line of duty, fine.
Occupational hazard.

403
00:35:38,598 --> 00:35:42,185
But we must draw a firm line
between ourselves

404
00:35:42,311 --> 00:35:45,063
and this man they're looking for!

405
00:35:45,189 --> 00:35:47,357
We conduct our business
in order to survive,

406
00:35:47,483 --> 00:35:49,818
but this monster
has no right to survive!

407
00:35:49,944 --> 00:35:52,071
He must be killed,
eliminated, exterminated!

408
00:35:52,197 --> 00:35:54,490
Without mercy or compassion!

409
00:35:58,369 --> 00:36:00,162
Gentlemen,

410
00:36:00,872 --> 00:36:03,874
our members must be able
to go about their business again

411
00:36:04,459 --> 00:36:09,506
without frantic cops
in their way at every turn.

412
00:36:09,882 --> 00:36:11,007
I invite...

413
00:36:12,593 --> 00:36:15,720
...your views, gentlemen.

414
00:36:18,058 --> 00:36:21,935
Step up ID checks,
comb the entire city,

415
00:36:22,061 --> 00:36:26,565
and raids...
relentless, ever tougher raids!

416
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,735
We need informers!

417
00:36:29,903 --> 00:36:33,072
We must know the police's plans
almost before they do themselves!

418
00:36:33,198 --> 00:36:35,199
The girls gotta work the cops more!

419
00:36:35,576 --> 00:36:39,788
How often has one of us been nabbed
'cause his gal ratted on him to the cops?

420
00:36:40,248 --> 00:36:41,874
Now they can rat on the cops!

421
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,170
Every resident, every landlord,

422
00:36:46,588 --> 00:36:50,174
every property owner

423
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:56,097
must be forced to consent
to meticulous searches of his property

424
00:36:56,307 --> 00:36:59,601
for the slightest of clues.

425
00:37:00,603 --> 00:37:03,980
What if we...
We have our connections.

426
00:37:05,149 --> 00:37:09,485
What if we put
an article in the papers

427
00:37:10,112 --> 00:37:14,450
that our syndicates...
I mean, our organization...

428
00:37:14,951 --> 00:37:18,579
doesn't wish to be lumped in
together with this pig,

429
00:37:18,705 --> 00:37:21,624
and that the cops should look
for this guy somewhere else.

430
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,335
He's not even a real crook!

431
00:37:23,628 --> 00:37:26,087
This man may well be...

432
00:37:26,796 --> 00:37:30,591
when not engaged
in the actual act of killing...

433
00:37:31,635 --> 00:37:35,555
a harmless, upstanding citizen

434
00:37:35,681 --> 00:37:37,182
who wouldn't hurt a fly.

435
00:37:37,308 --> 00:37:40,977
In his right mind, perhaps he plays
marbles with his landlady's kids

436
00:37:41,103 --> 00:37:43,314
or plays cards with friends.

437
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,193
Without what I'll call

438
00:37:47,361 --> 00:37:50,195
the innocuousness
of these murderers' private lives,

439
00:37:50,321 --> 00:37:54,825
it's inconceivable that someone
like Grossmann or Haarmann

440
00:37:54,952 --> 00:37:59,163
could have lived right next door
to their neighbors for years

441
00:37:59,498 --> 00:38:03,168
without arousing
the faintest trace of suspicion!

442
00:38:03,336 --> 00:38:06,338
This is where we must focus
the public's attention.

443
00:38:06,464 --> 00:38:08,674
The public must cooperate.

444
00:38:09,093 --> 00:38:12,219
I'll tell you about public cooperation!

445
00:38:12,637 --> 00:38:15,472
Just thinking of it makes me puke.

446
00:38:16,724 --> 00:38:18,476
I beg your pardon, Commissioner.

447
00:38:18,602 --> 00:38:21,938
But ain't it the truth?

448
00:38:22,898 --> 00:38:26,359
What the devil has public cooperation
gotten us so far?

449
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,532
Piles of letters
full of the most outrageous slander!

450
00:38:31,658 --> 00:38:33,032
Very true.

451
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,286
They alert homicide
whenever a chimney sweep walks by.

452
00:38:36,412 --> 00:38:37,746
That's right.

453
00:38:37,872 --> 00:38:40,833
But when you really want
reliable information from them,

454
00:38:41,668 --> 00:38:43,585
then they suddenly haven't got a clue.

455
00:38:43,962 --> 00:38:47,424
Why, they just can't seem
to remember a thing.

456
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:51,886
There's your public cooperation
for you!

457
00:38:52,972 --> 00:38:55,890
I believe you're exaggerating a bit,
Lohmann.

458
00:38:56,892 --> 00:38:59,352
It can't really be that bad, can it?

459
00:38:59,854 --> 00:39:02,397
But it is, Commissioner!

460
00:39:02,898 --> 00:39:06,736
Most of the public
still takes the position,

461
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:08,946
"How does this concern me?"

462
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:13,827
The idea that
each individual is responsible

463
00:39:13,953 --> 00:39:17,913
for what happens to the poorest,
most anonymous child on the street

464
00:39:18,081 --> 00:39:21,876
hasn't even dawned
on the public at large!

465
00:39:25,256 --> 00:39:26,882
I've got another idea.

466
00:39:27,008 --> 00:39:28,925
There was this magician.

467
00:39:29,052 --> 00:39:32,597
Te... Tele...
I can't remember what you call it.

468
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:35,975
Anyway, he could conjure up
hidden pennies out of handkerchiefs.

469
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:39,144
The reward is still
far too little money.

470
00:39:40,938 --> 00:39:45,777
The man who leads us
to the murderer should get a fortune.

471
00:39:45,944 --> 00:39:48,321
None of this is anything new.

472
00:39:48,447 --> 00:39:50,239
This is all leading nowhere.

473
00:39:50,741 --> 00:39:54,620
So we just wait for the police
to catch the guy instead?

474
00:39:57,624 --> 00:40:01,460
The difficulties
in solving crimes of this nature

475
00:40:01,586 --> 00:40:04,922
are, in my experience,
often insurmountable,

476
00:40:05,465 --> 00:40:07,758
since perpetrator and victim

477
00:40:07,884 --> 00:40:11,554
are often brought together
by mere chance.

478
00:40:11,847 --> 00:40:15,392
The instincts of the moment
drive the murderer's actions.

479
00:40:15,643 --> 00:40:19,271
The victim is found and identified,

480
00:40:19,648 --> 00:40:21,816
his or her last known whereabouts
are determined,

481
00:40:21,983 --> 00:40:23,691
and then...

482
00:40:24,944 --> 00:40:28,155
then comes the big question mark.

483
00:40:29,825 --> 00:40:32,576
These children vanish
without a trace.

484
00:40:35,288 --> 00:40:37,749
And when they're found...

485
00:40:41,462 --> 00:40:46,215
Well, we all know the state
in which we've found them.

486
00:40:48,845 --> 00:40:50,887
And the perpetrator...

487
00:40:53,182 --> 00:40:55,142
It's a fact well-known to all of us

488
00:40:55,268 --> 00:40:59,272
that murderers like this
rarely leave a clue behind.

489
00:40:59,731 --> 00:41:03,693
That's what makes our work so hard,
our successes so few.

490
00:41:03,819 --> 00:41:07,406
The police have been after
this murderer for eight months now.

491
00:41:08,991 --> 00:41:12,243
- They'll only get him by accident now.
- We can't wait for that.

492
00:41:12,411 --> 00:41:14,872
No, we'll go broke by then.

493
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,165
What, then?

494
00:41:33,601 --> 00:41:35,477
We have to catch him...

495
00:41:36,687 --> 00:41:38,229
ourselves.

496
00:41:42,944 --> 00:41:45,446
Yes, that's what we must do.

497
00:41:46,781 --> 00:41:51,160
There is perhaps one other way.

498
00:41:51,704 --> 00:41:54,788
I'm quite certain that information
on the individual in question

499
00:41:54,915 --> 00:42:00,419
must already exist somewhere.

500
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:04,591
Being the severely pathological case
that he is,

501
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:09,262
he has no doubt already had some kind
of contact with the authorities.

502
00:42:10,474 --> 00:42:13,850
That's why all health care facilities,

503
00:42:14,185 --> 00:42:17,771
prisons, clinics and insane asylums

504
00:42:18,105 --> 00:42:21,859
must be encouraged
to cooperate with us unequivocally.

505
00:42:22,569 --> 00:42:25,613
We specifically need information

506
00:42:25,781 --> 00:42:30,202
on those released after being deemed
harmless to society

507
00:42:30,537 --> 00:42:33,872
but who, due to their inclinations,

508
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:36,958
could be the murderer.

509
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:40,337
We must cover the city
with a net of informers.

510
00:42:41,798 --> 00:42:45,467
Every square mile must be
under constant surveillance.

511
00:42:45,718 --> 00:42:49,222
No child in this city must take
a single step without us knowing it.

512
00:42:49,348 --> 00:42:51,724
- Fine, but how?
- And who?

513
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:55,562
It must be people who can go
anywhere without causing a stir,

514
00:42:55,688 --> 00:42:58,815
follow anyone
without attracting attention,

515
00:42:58,983 --> 00:43:02,986
follow any child to any house
without arousing suspicion.

516
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:07,491
In short, people whom the killer
would never suspect.

517
00:43:07,617 --> 00:43:09,827
- But who?
- There are no such people!

518
00:43:09,995 --> 00:43:11,996
- Who could do that?
- Who?

519
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:17,544
The beggars.

520
00:43:18,045 --> 00:43:20,296
The organization of beggars!

521
00:43:50,495 --> 00:43:52,998
MR. CREDIT IS DEAD AND BURIED -
THE MANAGEMENT

522
00:43:59,547 --> 00:44:01,507
Blood pudding's on the upswing.

523
00:44:04,053 --> 00:44:06,553
God, this cheese stinks so good.

524
00:44:13,228 --> 00:44:15,229
Take that, you sons of bitches!

525
00:44:25,033 --> 00:44:28,326
Hey, stop snoring.
You'll wake up the lice.

526
00:44:37,922 --> 00:44:39,422
Two, four, six...

527
00:44:41,509 --> 00:44:43,885
NO BEGGARS OR PEDDLERS

528
00:44:47,098 --> 00:44:49,974
SANDWICHES

529
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:00,986
Bread-and-butter sandwich,
lukewarm response.

530
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:06,660
Black Friday for roast beef.

531
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:29,183
All right.
Now come the courtyards.

532
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:34,147
Yes, from number 1 to 88.

533
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,068
Next.

534
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:47,953
You're responsible for the courtyards
on Hauptstrasse from 1 to 88.

535
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,621
Got it.

536
00:45:49,748 --> 00:45:51,165
What's next?

537
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:54,669
Hauptstrasse, from number 89...

538
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:57,254
to 196.

539
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,465
Hauptstrasse,

540
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:04,012
number 89 to 196.

541
00:46:04,638 --> 00:46:08,850
- Member number?
- 3795. Emil Dustermann.

542
00:46:25,202 --> 00:46:27,828
Well, Emil, maybe
you'll win the 15,000.

543
00:46:27,954 --> 00:46:30,373
I've got my fingers crossed.

544
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:32,209
Knock on wood.

545
00:47:14,254 --> 00:47:16,798
My heartfelt thanks,
ladies and gentlemen.

546
00:47:19,218 --> 00:47:21,219
Thank you.

547
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:16,193
"In searching homes,
be on the lookout for any clue

548
00:48:16,695 --> 00:48:20,157
which could establish the origin
of the murderer's letter to the Courier.

549
00:48:20,617 --> 00:48:22,326
Be on the lookout as well

550
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:25,621
for an old wooden table..."

551
00:48:26,789 --> 00:48:28,248
Idiot!

552
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:35,505
"...or red pencil..."

553
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:37,925
Come in.

554
00:48:38,969 --> 00:48:42,680
"... or writing paper
of the type used by the killer."

555
00:48:43,682 --> 00:48:48,520
Inspector, here are reports on mental
patients who've been released as cured

556
00:48:48,688 --> 00:48:51,565
or deemed harmless
over the last five years.

557
00:48:51,691 --> 00:48:53,900
Reports from every
private and public institute,

558
00:48:54,026 --> 00:48:57,237
as well as from
municipal hospitals and asylums.

559
00:49:09,502 --> 00:49:13,672
And here's a list
of their present addresses.

560
00:49:49,585 --> 00:49:52,587
Good day.
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?

561
00:49:52,714 --> 00:49:53,923
Pardon me?

562
00:49:54,133 --> 00:49:56,634
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?

563
00:49:56,844 --> 00:49:59,928
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm a bit hard of hearing.

564
00:50:00,096 --> 00:50:01,805
You don't say.

565
00:50:02,141 --> 00:50:04,726
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?

566
00:50:05,019 --> 00:50:09,522
Mr. Beckert... yes, he does.
But he just stepped out.

567
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:12,901
I had hoped to speak with him.

568
00:50:13,695 --> 00:50:16,071
I'm from the tax office.

569
00:50:16,281 --> 00:50:18,574
The tax office. Oh, my Lord!

570
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:21,410
Perhaps you'd like to wait for him...

571
00:50:21,536 --> 00:50:23,287
Yes, thank you.

572
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:34,382
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

573
00:50:47,313 --> 00:50:50,858
- Perhaps you'd like something to read.
- Thank you. Most kind.

574
00:50:50,984 --> 00:50:53,861
THE GENERAL GAZETTE

575
00:50:54,237 --> 00:50:55,696
Tell me, Mrs. Winkler,

576
00:50:56,198 --> 00:50:58,617
does Mr. Beckert
subscribe to any newspapers?

577
00:50:58,993 --> 00:51:02,496
Mr. Beckert?
No, he always borrows mine.

578
00:51:02,914 --> 00:51:05,206
I see. Thank you.

579
00:54:18,413 --> 00:54:21,916
Mommy!
I wanted to meet you halfway!

580
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:24,710
Child, you mustn't do that.

581
00:54:25,086 --> 00:54:26,628
You know why.

582
00:55:11,385 --> 00:55:13,261
Good day.
What would you like?

583
00:55:13,471 --> 00:55:14,971
Coffee.

584
00:55:15,639 --> 00:55:18,809
No, a vermouth.
No, a cognac.

585
00:55:44,629 --> 00:55:46,130
Here you are.

586
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:53,345
Another.

587
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:29,008
Check.

588
00:56:29,343 --> 00:56:32,138
Two cognacs...
that's 1.65, please.

589
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,516
Thank you very much.

590
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:46,444
Number 24: Beckert.
Doesn't take the Courier.

591
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,196
Table: polished mahogany,
with tablecloth.

592
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:53,034
No traces of red pencil.
In fact, no writing materials of any kind.

593
00:56:53,369 --> 00:56:54,911
Printed matter found in wastebasket:

594
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:57,080
cigar ad and a postcard

595
00:56:57,707 --> 00:56:59,416
with flowers
and "Regards, Paul" on it,

596
00:56:59,542 --> 00:57:01,376
but no address of sender.

597
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:04,880
An empty cigarette pack, Ariston brand,
a bag of candy...

598
00:57:08,635 --> 00:57:10,470
Just a moment.

599
00:57:13,891 --> 00:57:15,892
Ariston?

600
00:57:27,113 --> 00:57:29,156
What was that?

601
00:57:39,001 --> 00:57:44,880
I'd like the file
on the Marga Perl murder case.

602
00:57:47,134 --> 00:57:48,927
Thank you very much.

603
00:57:56,895 --> 00:57:58,646
That's odd.

604
00:57:59,898 --> 00:58:02,566
I've heard that before.

605
00:58:05,612 --> 00:58:07,196
It was...

606
00:58:10,033 --> 00:58:11,659
It was...

607
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,516
Hey, Heinrich!

608
00:58:39,022 --> 00:58:40,899
What is it?

609
00:58:42,569 --> 00:58:46,363
- What's wrong?
- Listen. Someone's whistling.

610
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:49,365
Can't you hear it?

611
00:58:49,658 --> 00:58:50,951
There.

612
00:58:53,538 --> 00:58:55,080
Now he's stopped.

613
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:59,084
Did you see
the guy who was whistling?

614
00:58:59,211 --> 00:59:01,546
Yes, I can still see him.

615
00:59:01,672 --> 00:59:07,302
Heinrich, he's talking to a little girl
and walking her down the street.

616
00:59:07,511 --> 00:59:11,431
- After him, quick, and don't lose him!
- Why?

617
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:15,935
The day little Elsie Beckmann
was killed,

618
00:59:16,061 --> 00:59:18,772
a man bought a balloon from me.

619
00:59:18,898 --> 00:59:21,942
He was with a little girl...

620
00:59:25,697 --> 00:59:30,869
and he whistled just like that!

621
01:00:59,798 --> 01:01:01,257
Damn it, man!

622
01:01:01,466 --> 01:01:04,426
Are you crazy,
throwing orange peels on the ground?

623
01:01:04,552 --> 01:01:06,803
A man could slip and break his neck!
Unbelievable!

624
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:09,181
I should report you to the police!

625
01:01:09,433 --> 01:01:11,934
Outrageous behavior!

626
01:01:13,854 --> 01:01:15,354
Hey, mister.

627
01:01:28,661 --> 01:01:30,412
Aha! Here it is.

628
01:01:30,663 --> 01:01:36,543
"In a 150-foot radius
of the crime scene,

629
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:39,922
three cigarette butts of the Ariston brand
were found." There you have it.

630
01:01:40,632 --> 01:01:43,593
Yes, it may be
the same brand of cigarettes,

631
01:01:44,636 --> 01:01:47,180
but there was no old wooden table.

632
01:01:48,182 --> 01:01:53,686
Of course, he could have written
that letter somewhere else.

633
01:01:58,401 --> 01:02:00,110
Good God!

634
01:02:01,529 --> 01:02:02,988
The window ledge!

635
01:02:16,337 --> 01:02:17,962
You're right.

636
01:02:20,049 --> 01:02:21,966
Just a minute.

637
01:02:29,518 --> 01:02:30,683
Red pencil.

638
01:02:33,897 --> 01:02:35,648
My God, finally!

639
01:02:37,067 --> 01:02:39,527
We're finally on his trail.

640
01:02:42,281 --> 01:02:43,532
What?

641
01:02:44,325 --> 01:02:46,243
They're on his trail?

642
01:02:47,411 --> 01:02:50,163
- Did they find him?
- The beggars found him.

643
01:02:50,414 --> 01:02:52,749
- His whistling gave him away.
- They put a mark on him.

644
01:02:52,875 --> 01:02:54,292
Shut up!

645
01:02:54,752 --> 01:02:56,378
What did you say?

646
01:02:56,504 --> 01:03:00,591
They're following the mark.
He isn't out of sight for a second.

647
01:03:02,261 --> 01:03:04,762
His every move is being watched.

648
01:04:12,251 --> 01:04:14,045
- Mister.
- What is it?

649
01:04:14,171 --> 01:04:17,006
- You got some white stuff on your coat.
- Where?

650
01:04:17,591 --> 01:04:19,383
On your shoulder.

651
01:04:24,181 --> 01:04:26,390
Here, I'll wipe it off.

652
01:04:33,191 --> 01:04:35,984
- What's the matter?
- Come on. We're leaving.

653
01:06:08,083 --> 01:06:10,626
He didn't come out this way.
We would've seen him.

654
01:06:10,794 --> 01:06:11,918
Out of the question!

655
01:06:12,045 --> 01:06:16,049
- Well, he didn't turn back.
- He has to be somewhere, damn it!

656
01:06:20,304 --> 01:06:23,473
Maybe he's hiding
inside the building.

657
01:06:43,913 --> 01:06:45,163
Closing time!

658
01:06:45,289 --> 01:06:49,459
We can't let him get away in the crowd!
If he slips through now...

659
01:06:49,794 --> 01:06:51,169
They're starting to come out!

660
01:06:51,295 --> 01:06:53,672
Out in the street,
and keep your eyes peeled!

661
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:04,350
Excuse me, may I ask you a question?

662
01:07:05,769 --> 01:07:08,187
My trip is tomorrow.
I start in Königsberg...

663
01:07:10,066 --> 01:07:12,901
No, in my condition
I can't eat anything like that...

664
01:07:13,152 --> 01:07:16,029
The boss came to my office today...

665
01:07:18,323 --> 01:07:20,158
Turn off the light.

666
01:07:20,284 --> 01:07:23,578
He'll get suspicious
if he comes home and sees it on.

667
01:07:28,292 --> 01:07:30,169
What time is it, anyway?

668
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:33,589
Almost 6:30.

669
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:53,861
He's gotta still be inside!

670
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:57,240
He definitely didn't come out
with the office crowd.

671
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,791
No, just a moment.

672
01:08:07,793 --> 01:08:10,628
The beggars have called for backup
and surrounded the whole building.

673
01:08:10,754 --> 01:08:13,548
They figure the guy's hiding
in the building.

674
01:08:19,014 --> 01:08:20,848
What sort of building is it?

675
01:08:22,475 --> 01:08:24,643
What sort of building is it?

676
01:08:24,769 --> 01:08:27,354
Nothing but offices.

677
01:08:28,732 --> 01:08:30,774
I don't know what's in the basement.

678
01:08:31,443 --> 01:08:34,404
There's a branch of the local
savings bank on the ground floor,

679
01:08:34,739 --> 01:08:38,950
and the second to sixth floors
are nothing but offices.

680
01:08:39,076 --> 01:08:40,660
Above that is the attic space.

681
01:08:46,459 --> 01:08:48,293
This is unbelievable.

682
01:08:50,087 --> 01:08:51,755
Anyone still in there?

683
01:08:59,681 --> 01:09:01,308
Anyone still in here?

684
01:09:20,329 --> 01:09:21,913
What the devil!

685
01:09:22,665 --> 01:09:24,332
Anybody still in here?

686
01:09:34,343 --> 01:09:36,552
Damn carelessness!

687
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:41,267
All that trouble for one door.

688
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:06,127
Seems the guy's cornered now.

689
01:10:06,378 --> 01:10:09,046
I think we should tip
the cops off right away.

690
01:10:09,172 --> 01:10:11,257
- I agree.
- Let's not waste time!

691
01:10:12,718 --> 01:10:16,762
Stay by the phone
and call back in a few minutes.

692
01:10:17,014 --> 01:10:18,347
What is it?

693
01:10:18,515 --> 01:10:20,850
Are you crazy or something?
The police?

694
01:10:21,184 --> 01:10:23,853
No! We're gonna get
this guy ourselves!

695
01:10:24,062 --> 01:10:25,731
Listen, the time now is...

696
01:10:27,233 --> 01:10:28,108
8:00.

697
01:10:28,234 --> 01:10:32,529
All right. 9:00... 10:00...

698
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:33,906
At 11:00!

699
01:10:58,058 --> 01:11:01,727
Evening. Did you know
your gate isn't closed?

700
01:11:01,853 --> 01:11:04,480
What? That's impossible!

701
01:11:05,106 --> 01:11:08,150
Why I just... Wait, it is!

702
01:11:10,946 --> 01:11:13,615
Open up, quick!
And not a sound!

703
01:11:13,741 --> 01:11:15,950
Come on! Move it!

704
01:11:16,285 --> 01:11:18,370
Let's go!

705
01:11:18,496 --> 01:11:20,414
Come on, move it!

706
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:50,779
How many other watchmen
are in the building?

707
01:11:53,741 --> 01:11:55,867
Don't want to answer, eh?

708
01:11:57,496 --> 01:11:59,122
Very well.

709
01:12:32,824 --> 01:12:34,868
There are still two watchmen
on their rounds.

710
01:12:58,518 --> 01:13:00,394
Goddamn it!

711
01:13:00,562 --> 01:13:03,356
Damn piece of crap!

712
01:13:10,156 --> 01:13:12,240
Goddamned lock!

713
01:13:26,089 --> 01:13:28,174
Damn it to hell!

714
01:13:28,467 --> 01:13:29,927
Shit!

715
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:27,821
Careful where you shine those lights!

716
01:14:28,072 --> 01:14:30,699
And don't stomp around
like elephants!

717
01:14:30,825 --> 01:14:32,617
He's not in the basement.

718
01:14:32,743 --> 01:14:34,954
We went through it all
and found nothing.

719
01:14:35,831 --> 01:14:38,499
Two men are still going
through the boiler room.

720
01:14:39,084 --> 01:14:40,292
Hold it!

721
01:14:40,418 --> 01:14:42,002
This is the last one.

722
01:14:42,253 --> 01:14:44,839
Go up and join Emil.
He needs help.

723
01:14:52,472 --> 01:14:54,016
Safecracker sent me.

724
01:14:54,267 --> 01:14:55,350
All right.

725
01:14:56,227 --> 01:14:57,519
Listen carefully.

726
01:14:58,021 --> 01:15:02,317
This is a new type of time clock.

727
01:15:03,109 --> 01:15:05,360
Here's a general diagram.

728
01:15:05,612 --> 01:15:07,988
If they're not set
at exactly the right minute,

729
01:15:08,114 --> 01:15:12,160
an alarm automatically goes off
at the nearest police station. Get it?

730
01:15:14,955 --> 01:15:16,497
You got it?

731
01:15:16,624 --> 01:15:19,375
- I'm not an idiot!
- Well...

732
01:15:21,171 --> 01:15:24,839
He's not in the boiler room
or the coal room.

733
01:15:24,965 --> 01:15:27,091
We turned over every piece of coal.

734
01:15:30,347 --> 01:15:31,513
Hey!

735
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:34,433
Are you nuts?

736
01:15:34,559 --> 01:15:39,397
What if the doors are wired?
You want the police here in five minutes?

737
01:15:40,941 --> 01:15:44,611
We gotta get in if we're gonna
search the whole place!

738
01:15:44,862 --> 01:15:47,071
But not through the door, you idiot!

739
01:15:47,238 --> 01:15:49,449
Go through the ceiling
of the office above!

740
01:15:56,082 --> 01:15:57,374
Nothing.

741
01:16:33,538 --> 01:16:35,581
All right. Down we go.

742
01:17:26,136 --> 01:17:28,179
Hey, what's up?

743
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:30,181
Hey! What is it?

744
01:17:30,307 --> 01:17:32,559
Wait a minute!
Answer me, damn it!

745
01:17:32,685 --> 01:17:35,187
- What's going on?
- I heard some banging!

746
01:17:36,481 --> 01:17:39,733
- Where are you off to?
- Why are you running?

747
01:17:44,405 --> 01:17:46,323
Wait, damn it!

748
01:17:47,658 --> 01:17:49,535
I've gotta see Safecracker!

749
01:17:49,703 --> 01:17:53,956
He's in the attic, I tell you!
I heard him knocking!

750
01:18:10,975 --> 01:18:12,059
Quiet!

751
01:19:01,445 --> 01:19:03,948
Go on! He has to be in there!

752
01:19:04,992 --> 01:19:06,783
Here's the light switch.

753
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:10,579
Force the locks.

754
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:12,456
Come on. Hurry up!

755
01:19:24,137 --> 01:19:27,681
Got him! I found the guy!
He's in the attic!

756
01:19:27,806 --> 01:19:30,308
I heard someone banging,
and I told Safecracker.

757
01:19:30,475 --> 01:19:33,478
He's up there with eight men.
They'll get him any moment now.

758
01:19:33,605 --> 01:19:35,772
Just came down to fill you in.

759
01:19:35,899 --> 01:19:38,859
If I hadn't been alert,
we could've looked for him for hours!

760
01:19:38,985 --> 01:19:40,153
The watchman!

761
01:19:45,451 --> 01:19:48,119
Three... one... four.

762
01:19:48,495 --> 01:19:49,996
314.

763
01:20:02,135 --> 01:20:04,511
- Everybody out!
- What?

764
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:08,683
- The cops'll be here in five minutes.
- Damn it! Who called 'em?

765
01:20:08,809 --> 01:20:11,019
- The watchman rang the alarm.
- Let's scram!

766
01:20:11,354 --> 01:20:12,603
Hold it!

767
01:20:12,854 --> 01:20:14,313
Quiet down!

768
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:17,817
Five more minutes,
six more storage sheds.

769
01:20:17,944 --> 01:20:20,195
Move it! Get going!

770
01:20:20,488 --> 01:20:22,906
Not like that!
Out of the way!

771
01:20:30,874 --> 01:20:32,917
- He's not in here.
- Next door!

772
01:20:33,627 --> 01:20:35,251
Come on! Faster!

773
01:20:40,008 --> 01:20:42,718
- He's not here either.
- Move on! Next door!

774
01:20:49,227 --> 01:20:52,396
Quickly! We've only got
three minutes left!

775
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:55,817
No padlock on this one...
he must be here!

776
01:20:55,901 --> 01:20:56,984
Open it!

777
01:20:57,110 --> 01:20:59,027
- Something's jammed inside.
- Let me do it!

778
01:20:59,153 --> 01:21:01,279
Hurry! Only one minute left!

779
01:21:05,619 --> 01:21:08,121
There he is, the dog!

780
01:21:08,789 --> 01:21:11,374
Come on! Move it!

781
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:14,837
Everybody out!

782
01:21:15,755 --> 01:21:17,798
Get out while you can, damn it!

783
01:21:18,008 --> 01:21:19,882
Move it!

784
01:21:21,802 --> 01:21:24,054
For Christ's sake, get going!

785
01:21:25,515 --> 01:21:27,433
- What's keeping the others?
- They're coming!

786
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:31,938
If not, they might as well stay here,
with or without the guy!

787
01:21:32,773 --> 01:21:35,567
What in the hell is keeping them?

788
01:21:35,818 --> 01:21:37,777
Finally! Thank God!

789
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:42,991
Quick now! Go!
Make it snappy!

790
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:18,946
He's not down here.

791
01:22:20,491 --> 01:22:23,993
Hey! Who pulled up the rope?

792
01:22:25,161 --> 01:22:28,748
Hey, who pulled up the rope?

793
01:22:31,001 --> 01:22:32,335
Bunch of morons!

794
01:22:47,352 --> 01:22:48,727
Hello there.

795
01:22:48,853 --> 01:22:50,229
Hands up!

796
01:22:50,563 --> 01:22:54,316
How can I put my hands up
when I'm holding on to the rope?

797
01:22:54,442 --> 01:22:55,652
Come out of there!

798
01:23:06,081 --> 01:23:07,915
I'm really innocent this time...

799
01:23:09,083 --> 01:23:10,750
...like a newborn babe.

800
01:23:15,215 --> 01:23:17,758
This may surprise you, Franz...

801
01:23:19,302 --> 01:23:20,719
but I believe you.

802
01:23:24,475 --> 01:23:27,394
Then everything's in order,

803
01:23:27,562 --> 01:23:29,020
and I can go now, right?

804
01:23:29,230 --> 01:23:31,105
Just a moment.

805
01:23:33,901 --> 01:23:35,068
Cigarette?

806
01:23:35,236 --> 01:23:36,736
Uh-oh.

807
01:23:48,959 --> 01:23:51,211
I'll take your word for it, Franz...

808
01:23:52,589 --> 01:23:54,672
provided...

809
01:23:55,591 --> 01:23:59,302
you can tell me...

810
01:24:00,722 --> 01:24:04,850
who the man was
that you were looking for

811
01:24:04,976 --> 01:24:07,936
and that you found in that building.

812
01:24:08,438 --> 01:24:10,106
I don't understand, Inspector.

813
01:24:11,358 --> 01:24:13,484
A man, you say?

814
01:24:14,987 --> 01:24:19,532
I know nothing about that.
There must be some mistake.

815
01:24:20,534 --> 01:24:22,619
I know nothing.

816
01:24:22,745 --> 01:24:24,621
Nothing at all.

817
01:24:25,372 --> 01:24:26,998
Of course.

818
01:24:27,959 --> 01:24:29,793
There's just one thing I don't get:

819
01:24:29,961 --> 01:24:31,754
why you're covering up

820
01:24:31,963 --> 01:24:34,298
for the gang
who left you in the lurch.

821
01:24:36,134 --> 01:24:39,303
Fine friends, running off
when things heat up,

822
01:24:39,429 --> 01:24:41,347
leaving you right in the fire.

823
01:24:42,224 --> 01:24:43,766
Phooey!

824
01:24:45,978 --> 01:24:50,106
That ploy won't work with me,
Inspector.

825
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:18,428
Listen...

826
01:25:24,143 --> 01:25:26,311
What can happen to me anyway?

827
01:25:26,896 --> 01:25:29,564
Maybe a little property damage...
so what?

828
01:25:30,483 --> 01:25:31,900
Nothing was pinched!

829
01:25:32,027 --> 01:25:34,028
But something was pinched,
my friend!

830
01:25:34,655 --> 01:25:35,863
In fact, a good deal.

831
01:25:35,990 --> 01:25:38,616
What? Something got pinched?

832
01:25:40,494 --> 01:25:42,079
How much?

833
01:25:42,205 --> 01:25:45,623
Tell me what you know
and I'll do the same.

834
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:48,793
I already told you.
I know nothing.

835
01:25:51,339 --> 01:25:52,840
Very well.

836
01:25:56,094 --> 01:25:58,387
Give it some thought, Franz.

837
01:25:59,514 --> 01:26:05,729
Leave a man alone
for a couple hours...

838
01:26:06,730 --> 01:26:11,776
and a lot comes back to him
that he couldn't remember before.

839
01:26:14,113 --> 01:26:15,572
Take him away.

840
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:33,424
Send the night watchman in.

841
01:26:36,762 --> 01:26:38,597
Mr. Damowatz.

842
01:26:45,563 --> 01:26:47,065
Please sit down.

843
01:26:49,443 --> 01:26:53,278
Now then, you said
in your statement...

844
01:26:54,072 --> 01:26:57,950
Listen carefully, in case
you have to testify under oath later.

845
01:27:01,288 --> 01:27:06,085
You clearly heard one of the burglars
say to the guy guarding you,

846
01:27:06,544 --> 01:27:10,381
"We got him. I found the guy.
He's in the attic."

847
01:27:10,507 --> 01:27:13,466
- Is that correct?
- Yes, Inspector.

848
01:27:15,095 --> 01:27:21,308
Yes, I'll swear to that anytime.

849
01:27:22,477 --> 01:27:23,603
Good.

850
01:27:23,729 --> 01:27:26,231
Go home now
and recover from your ordeal.

851
01:27:26,524 --> 01:27:29,442
But please remain available
for further questioning.

852
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:31,820
Of course, Inspector.

853
01:27:34,241 --> 01:27:35,907
Good morning, Inspector.

854
01:27:36,033 --> 01:27:37,409
Morning.

855
01:27:51,134 --> 01:27:54,553
Tell me, is Inspector Lohmann
in the building?

856
01:27:55,763 --> 01:27:58,639
He's talking to someone?
No, it doesn't matter.

857
01:27:59,015 --> 01:28:01,518
I'll come over myself.

858
01:28:04,439 --> 01:28:06,773
What? I see.

859
01:28:07,608 --> 01:28:10,027
Hasn't come home yet, eh?

860
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,990
Did you keep an eye
on the old Winkler woman too?

861
01:28:14,241 --> 01:28:15,616
Come in.

862
01:28:16,368 --> 01:28:17,702
Come in!

863
01:28:19,037 --> 01:28:21,330
- Am I disturbing you?
- No, come in.

864
01:28:22,791 --> 01:28:25,543
Listen, the whole block
is surrounded.

865
01:28:25,752 --> 01:28:29,214
If he decides to go home,
he has to run into us.

866
01:28:29,716 --> 01:28:31,925
So just keep on waiting.

867
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:35,429
If anything happens,
I'll be here at the precinct.

868
01:28:39,852 --> 01:28:41,226
Damn it!

869
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:49,360
What do you want?

870
01:28:49,778 --> 01:28:51,905
I wanted...

871
01:28:53,324 --> 01:28:55,241
to ask a favor of you.

872
01:28:58,580 --> 01:29:00,414
Dishwater again!

873
01:29:00,749 --> 01:29:02,750
I wanted to ask you...

874
01:29:03,751 --> 01:29:06,420
Read this first.

875
01:29:12,844 --> 01:29:14,596
- A statement?
- Yeah.

876
01:29:15,431 --> 01:29:17,432
An office building was broken into.

877
01:29:24,858 --> 01:29:26,399
Bennostrasse?

878
01:29:26,943 --> 01:29:28,652
That's a respectable part of town.

879
01:29:30,696 --> 01:29:32,865
Perhaps not that respectable after all.

880
01:29:34,576 --> 01:29:35,993
Hell, this is getting serious!

881
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:47,505
What the... Did they mean to empty
the whole joint?

882
01:29:49,466 --> 01:29:52,761
What could they have been
looking for in the coal?

883
01:29:54,138 --> 01:29:56,765
Incredible! Unbelievable!

884
01:30:00,144 --> 01:30:01,604
I'll be damned!

885
01:30:05,526 --> 01:30:07,318
This is madness!

886
01:30:10,489 --> 01:30:13,866
Ah, so they were after
the savings bank!

887
01:30:15,244 --> 01:30:17,328
Good God!
What could this mean?

888
01:30:18,998 --> 01:30:21,333
I don't understand at all.

889
01:30:21,668 --> 01:30:23,794
They didn't even touch it?

890
01:30:24,004 --> 01:30:27,214
Must've been a bunch of real idiots!

891
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,760
I'll be damned!

892
01:30:31,928 --> 01:30:34,221
Isn't that something?

893
01:30:34,472 --> 01:30:37,474
Nothing stolen,
but a man was carried off.

894
01:30:37,685 --> 01:30:39,603
God knows where they took him.

895
01:30:39,854 --> 01:30:41,521
That's just great.

896
01:30:41,856 --> 01:30:44,774
And Franz isn't talking.

897
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:46,359
He's afraid, of course.

898
01:30:47,029 --> 01:30:51,574
I know him well. Guy like him would
rather jump out the fifth-floor window

899
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:53,658
than be mixed up in a murder rap.

900
01:30:55,620 --> 01:31:01,125
What if we could
get at him from that angle?

901
01:31:02,127 --> 01:31:05,714
Lohmann, if you'd be willing
to help me out...

902
01:31:09,135 --> 01:31:11,011
Very clever.

903
01:31:11,512 --> 01:31:13,472
I see the wheels turning.

904
01:31:15,225 --> 01:31:18,185
Let's send for this Franz.

905
01:31:22,315 --> 01:31:23,941
You're wanted for questioning.

906
01:31:25,277 --> 01:31:28,279
What? They sent four guys for me?

907
01:31:28,572 --> 01:31:31,032
- What's this about?
- Move it!

908
01:31:54,475 --> 01:31:57,143
"Homicide squad.

909
01:31:57,895 --> 01:32:01,564
Inspector Karl Lohmann."

910
01:32:07,029 --> 01:32:09,155
What do you want with me?

911
01:32:09,573 --> 01:32:12,493
What have I got to do
with the homicide squad?

912
01:32:23,463 --> 01:32:25,297
Yes, young man...

913
01:32:26,383 --> 01:32:28,634
your case has been turned over to me.

914
01:32:32,598 --> 01:32:34,307
But why?

915
01:32:37,019 --> 01:32:38,271
Why?

916
01:32:40,149 --> 01:32:43,985
You boys did your work
a little too well.

917
01:32:50,659 --> 01:32:52,535
One of the watchmen...

918
01:33:02,172 --> 01:33:03,255
Dead?

919
01:33:08,511 --> 01:33:10,429
Accessory to murder.

920
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:13,640
Nasty business.

921
01:33:13,767 --> 01:33:16,811
Inspector, I've had enough!

922
01:33:16,937 --> 01:33:18,980
I want no part of this!

923
01:33:19,106 --> 01:33:21,941
I'll tell you everything I know!

924
01:33:22,985 --> 01:33:25,362
Very sensible,
but, unfortunately, too late.

925
01:33:25,572 --> 01:33:28,240
It can't be too late!

926
01:33:28,365 --> 01:33:30,742
It can't be!

927
01:33:31,285 --> 01:33:33,411
I'll tell you everything!

928
01:33:34,206 --> 01:33:37,625
Even what we were looking for
in that damn building.

929
01:33:37,876 --> 01:33:39,251
Well...

930
01:33:40,545 --> 01:33:42,338
The child murderer!

931
01:33:52,975 --> 01:33:54,267
What?

932
01:33:55,186 --> 01:33:56,478
Who?

933
01:33:56,896 --> 01:33:59,105
The child murderer, Inspector.

934
01:34:05,405 --> 01:34:07,073
Just a moment.

935
01:34:25,218 --> 01:34:27,678
This had to happen to me!

936
01:34:31,141 --> 01:34:33,893
Me, of all people.

937
01:34:41,443 --> 01:34:43,319
Come sit down, my boy.

938
01:34:47,533 --> 01:34:51,662
We're gonna level
with each other, got it?

939
01:34:52,205 --> 01:34:53,455
Certainly, Inspector.

940
01:34:53,665 --> 01:34:56,417
And God help you
if you pull something.

941
01:34:57,460 --> 01:34:58,961
Now then...

942
01:34:59,212 --> 01:35:01,630
what have you boys got to do
with the murderer,

943
01:35:02,048 --> 01:35:04,675
and where was the guy taken?

944
01:35:07,138 --> 01:35:10,056
Well, Inspector...

945
01:35:11,475 --> 01:35:15,813
you know the old
Kuntz & Levy distillery?

946
01:35:16,398 --> 01:35:19,149
The one that went belly-up
in the Depression?

947
01:35:19,275 --> 01:35:21,693
That's the one.

948
01:35:21,819 --> 01:35:25,114
Since then, the building's stood empty,
and no one gives a damn about it.

949
01:35:45,345 --> 01:35:47,679
Get out here! Move it!

950
01:35:50,516 --> 01:35:52,351
Let me go!

951
01:36:01,195 --> 01:36:03,196
What have I done to you?

952
01:36:03,322 --> 01:36:04,405
You swine!

953
01:36:04,531 --> 01:36:07,825
Let go of me!

954
01:36:10,204 --> 01:36:12,957
Bastards!

955
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:16,460
Swine!
What do you want from me?

956
01:36:16,795 --> 01:36:18,545
What do you want...

957
01:36:48,578 --> 01:36:49,829
Help!

958
01:36:49,955 --> 01:36:53,874
Help! Let me out of here!

959
01:36:54,251 --> 01:36:56,419
I want out!

960
01:36:56,628 --> 01:36:58,672
Let me out of here!

961
01:36:58,798 --> 01:37:01,758
You'll never get out of here.

962
01:37:03,011 --> 01:37:05,429
Gentlemen, I beg of you!

963
01:37:05,847 --> 01:37:08,766
I don't even know
what you want with me.

964
01:37:09,018 --> 01:37:11,226
I beg you, let me go.

965
01:37:11,436 --> 01:37:14,771
This whole thing must be a mistake!

966
01:37:15,983 --> 01:37:17,442
A mis...

967
01:37:19,403 --> 01:37:20,987
No.

968
01:37:21,572 --> 01:37:24,365
No mistake.
Out of the question.

969
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:27,244
This is no mistake.

970
01:37:32,958 --> 01:37:34,626
No.

971
01:37:35,336 --> 01:37:37,087
No mistake.

972
01:37:41,217 --> 01:37:42,885
You recognize this?

973
01:37:43,136 --> 01:37:47,849
You bought a balloon just like this
for little Elsie Beckmann.

974
01:37:47,975 --> 01:37:49,684
Just like this one.

975
01:37:55,399 --> 01:37:57,317
No!

976
01:37:58,486 --> 01:38:01,571
Where did you bury
little Marga Perl, you bastard?

977
01:38:06,495 --> 01:38:08,537
But I never...

978
01:38:09,372 --> 01:38:11,666
I never even met her!

979
01:38:14,504 --> 01:38:16,504
You never even met her!

980
01:38:19,007 --> 01:38:21,218
I suppose you never
met her either, huh?

981
01:38:23,096 --> 01:38:24,304
Or her?

982
01:38:27,183 --> 01:38:29,017
You never met her either, huh?

983
01:38:30,020 --> 01:38:31,687
- Stop him!
- Grab him!

984
01:38:31,814 --> 01:38:33,856
- Stop him!
- Don't let him escape!

985
01:38:34,024 --> 01:38:35,775
Watch out! The door!

986
01:38:36,693 --> 01:38:39,195
- Let me out!
- Punch him in the face!

987
01:38:39,363 --> 01:38:42,115
Let go of me!

988
01:39:04,139 --> 01:39:07,892
- You have no right to treat me this way!
- We'll show you we do!

989
01:39:08,102 --> 01:39:10,687
You have no right to hold me here!

990
01:39:10,896 --> 01:39:14,357
Right? There's only one thing
right for a man like you... death!

991
01:39:14,567 --> 01:39:16,610
- Right! Kill him!
- Kill the rabid dog!

992
01:39:16,736 --> 01:39:18,612
- Ice him!
- Let him have it!

993
01:39:18,864 --> 01:39:20,364
Quiet!

994
01:39:20,574 --> 01:39:22,240
Kill him!

995
01:39:31,626 --> 01:39:34,253
You spoke of "right" just now.

996
01:39:35,423 --> 01:39:37,549
We will be your right.

997
01:39:38,926 --> 01:39:42,429
Everyone sitting here
is an expert in the rule of law!

998
01:39:45,391 --> 01:39:47,642
From six weeks in Tegel prison...

999
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:50,604
to 15 years in Brandenburg.

1000
01:39:53,901 --> 01:39:57,069
They'll make sure
you get your rights.

1001
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:00,239
You'll even have defense counsel.

1002
01:40:01,533 --> 01:40:03,660
Everything according
to the letter of the law.

1003
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:05,954
Defense counsel?

1004
01:40:06,122 --> 01:40:09,081
I need no defense counsel!
Who's gonna prosecute me?

1005
01:40:09,374 --> 01:40:11,167
You, perhaps?

1006
01:40:13,796 --> 01:40:14,671
Hey, you.

1007
01:40:14,923 --> 01:40:18,967
If I were you,
I wouldn't make big speeches.

1008
01:40:19,135 --> 01:40:22,931
Your head's at stake here,
in case you hadn't noticed.

1009
01:40:23,849 --> 01:40:26,226
And just who are you?

1010
01:40:28,312 --> 01:40:33,358
I have the dubious pleasure
of serving as your defense.

1011
01:40:34,276 --> 01:40:36,694
Though I'm afraid
it won't do you much good.

1012
01:40:38,739 --> 01:40:42,910
Do you all want to kill me?
You want to just wipe me out?

1013
01:40:43,495 --> 01:40:47,122
We simply want to put you
out of commission.

1014
01:40:48,124 --> 01:40:50,543
And we'll only be sure
of that when you're dead.

1015
01:40:50,669 --> 01:40:53,712
But you can't murder me
just like that!

1016
01:40:56,424 --> 01:41:00,011
I demand to be handed over
to the police!

1017
01:41:03,349 --> 01:41:08,145
I demand to be brought
before a real court of law!

1018
01:41:09,398 --> 01:41:11,148
That's a good one!

1019
01:41:11,275 --> 01:41:13,817
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Look who's talking!

1020
01:41:14,026 --> 01:41:16,988
So you can plead insanity

1021
01:41:17,155 --> 01:41:20,283
and spend the rest of your life
being cared for by the state.

1022
01:41:20,492 --> 01:41:24,245
And then you break out of the asylum
or receive a pardon,

1023
01:41:24,621 --> 01:41:28,000
and you're happy as can be,
free to kill with impunity,

1024
01:41:28,543 --> 01:41:32,087
protected by law
on grounds of insanity...

1025
01:41:32,463 --> 01:41:36,425
and you're back to chasing little children!
No, no more of that!

1026
01:41:36,968 --> 01:41:39,553
You must be taken out of action!
You must go!

1027
01:41:40,555 --> 01:41:43,473
But I can't help it!

1028
01:41:48,731 --> 01:41:50,064
I can't...

1029
01:41:50,399 --> 01:41:55,612
I really can't... help it!

1030
01:41:58,032 --> 01:41:59,449
We know that one!

1031
01:42:00,075 --> 01:42:02,410
Before the judge,
we all "can't help it."

1032
01:42:09,294 --> 01:42:11,170
What would you know?

1033
01:42:11,463 --> 01:42:13,465
What are you talking about?

1034
01:42:13,883 --> 01:42:16,217
Who are you anyway?

1035
01:42:17,094 --> 01:42:18,636
Who are you?

1036
01:42:19,055 --> 01:42:21,013
All of you.

1037
01:42:21,349 --> 01:42:23,016
Criminals.

1038
01:42:24,143 --> 01:42:26,853
Probably proud of it, too...

1039
01:42:27,188 --> 01:42:29,272
proud you can crack a safe

1040
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:32,401
or sneak into houses
or cheat at cards.

1041
01:42:32,652 --> 01:42:36,614
All of which it seems to me
you could just as easily give up

1042
01:42:36,990 --> 01:42:39,367
if you had learned something useful,

1043
01:42:39,493 --> 01:42:41,452
or if you had jobs

1044
01:42:41,661 --> 01:42:44,205
or if you weren't such lazy pigs.

1045
01:42:45,665 --> 01:42:47,291
But me?

1046
01:42:47,626 --> 01:42:50,629
Can I do anything about it?

1047
01:42:51,798 --> 01:42:55,801
Don't I have
this cursed thing inside me?

1048
01:42:56,803 --> 01:42:59,972
This fire, this voice, this agony?

1049
01:43:03,768 --> 01:43:06,144
So you mean to say...

1050
01:43:07,021 --> 01:43:09,065
you have to kill?

1051
01:43:13,862 --> 01:43:17,074
I have to roam the streets endlessly,

1052
01:43:17,700 --> 01:43:19,743
always sensing

1053
01:43:20,203 --> 01:43:22,913
that someone's following me.

1054
01:43:23,039 --> 01:43:24,665
It's me!

1055
01:43:25,041 --> 01:43:27,000
I'm shadowing myself!

1056
01:43:28,336 --> 01:43:30,170
Silently...

1057
01:43:30,672 --> 01:43:32,673
but I still hear it!

1058
01:43:33,091 --> 01:43:37,429
Yes, sometimes I feel

1059
01:43:37,555 --> 01:43:39,556
like I'm tracking myself down.

1060
01:43:40,266 --> 01:43:43,351
I want to run...
run away from myself!

1061
01:43:43,769 --> 01:43:46,188
But I can't!
I can't escape from myself!

1062
01:43:47,023 --> 01:43:50,191
I must take the path
that it's driving me down

1063
01:43:50,359 --> 01:43:55,114
and run and run
down endless streets!

1064
01:43:55,365 --> 01:43:57,450
I want off!

1065
01:43:59,202 --> 01:44:02,496
And with me run the ghosts

1066
01:44:02,873 --> 01:44:06,293
of the mothers and children.

1067
01:44:06,419 --> 01:44:10,171
They never go away.
They're always there!

1068
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:11,881
Always!

1069
01:44:12,007 --> 01:44:13,717
Always!

1070
01:44:14,886 --> 01:44:16,470
Except...

1071
01:44:17,054 --> 01:44:19,055
when I'm doing it...

1072
01:44:19,932 --> 01:44:22,310
when I...

1073
01:44:29,485 --> 01:44:32,111
Then I don't remember a thing.

1074
01:44:33,071 --> 01:44:37,492
Then I'm standing before a poster,

1075
01:44:37,618 --> 01:44:40,161
reading what I've done.

1076
01:44:40,413 --> 01:44:42,456
I read and read...

1077
01:44:43,208 --> 01:44:45,125
I did that?

1078
01:44:45,752 --> 01:44:47,878
I don't remember a thing!

1079
01:44:49,005 --> 01:44:50,924
But who will believe me?

1080
01:44:51,091 --> 01:44:54,092
Who knows what it's like inside me?

1081
01:44:54,219 --> 01:44:59,098
How it screams and cries out
inside me when I have to do it!

1082
01:44:59,767 --> 01:45:01,434
Don't want to! Must!

1083
01:45:01,769 --> 01:45:04,062
Don't want to! Must!

1084
01:45:04,772 --> 01:45:07,732
And then a voice cries out,

1085
01:45:07,858 --> 01:45:10,277
and I can't listen anymore!

1086
01:45:10,570 --> 01:45:13,489
Help! I can't!

1087
01:45:13,782 --> 01:45:17,116
I can't!

1088
01:45:22,499 --> 01:45:24,708
The accused has stated

1089
01:45:25,126 --> 01:45:27,212
that he can't help himself.

1090
01:45:27,713 --> 01:45:31,508
In other words,
he must commit murder.

1091
01:45:33,678 --> 01:45:36,472
With that he has pronounced
his own death sentence.

1092
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:37,974
Right!

1093
01:45:38,141 --> 01:45:40,433
A man who claims

1094
01:45:41,227 --> 01:45:44,521
that he's compelled
to destroy the lives of others...

1095
01:45:44,981 --> 01:45:48,734
such a man must be
extinguished like a bonfire!

1096
01:45:48,902 --> 01:45:50,945
Such a man must be obliterated!

1097
01:45:51,113 --> 01:45:52,655
Wiped out!

1098
01:46:01,832 --> 01:46:04,042
May I address the court?

1099
01:46:04,419 --> 01:46:06,461
Counsel for the defense
has the floor.

1100
01:46:08,881 --> 01:46:12,843
My learned colleague
who just spoke...

1101
01:46:14,179 --> 01:46:16,514
who is, if I'm not mistaken,

1102
01:46:16,765 --> 01:46:19,642
wanted by the police
on three counts of manslaughter...

1103
01:46:19,768 --> 01:46:21,978
That's irrelevant here.

1104
01:46:22,188 --> 01:46:23,688
...has claimed...

1105
01:46:23,981 --> 01:46:27,108
...that the fact that my client
was acting compulsively

1106
01:46:27,234 --> 01:46:29,027
warrants the death sentence.

1107
01:46:29,278 --> 01:46:31,112
That's right!

1108
01:46:31,698 --> 01:46:33,073
He is mistaken,

1109
01:46:33,408 --> 01:46:37,369
because the very nature of compulsion
warrants an acquittal!

1110
01:46:37,537 --> 01:46:39,079
Get outta here, will ya?

1111
01:46:39,998 --> 01:46:41,249
Are you nuts, or plastered?

1112
01:46:41,375 --> 01:46:43,168
lt is precisely
the nature of compulsion

1113
01:46:43,294 --> 01:46:46,879
that relieves him
of responsibility for his actions!

1114
01:46:47,297 --> 01:46:50,842
And a man cannot be punished for that

1115
01:46:50,968 --> 01:46:52,427
for which he is not responsible!

1116
01:46:52,553 --> 01:46:57,098
- Ridiculous!
- You mean this monster should go free?

1117
01:46:57,224 --> 01:46:58,892
That he should live?

1118
01:46:59,018 --> 01:47:02,396
I'm saying that this man is sick,

1119
01:47:02,522 --> 01:47:06,484
and you turn a sick man
over to a doctor, not an executioner.

1120
01:47:06,610 --> 01:47:10,738
- Will you guarantee his cure?
- What does the state build asylums for?

1121
01:47:10,906 --> 01:47:14,742
- What if he breaks out?
- Or he's declared cured and released?

1122
01:47:14,868 --> 01:47:17,286
And one fine day
the killing starts all over?

1123
01:47:17,955 --> 01:47:19,748
Another month-long manhunt!

1124
01:47:19,874 --> 01:47:21,833
Once again the insanity clause,
once again the asylum!

1125
01:47:21,959 --> 01:47:25,420
Another breakout or possible release!
And again... "must kill"!

1126
01:47:26,130 --> 01:47:29,007
Is this supposed
to go on indefinitely?

1127
01:47:29,175 --> 01:47:34,513
No one has the right to kill a man

1128
01:47:34,639 --> 01:47:36,641
who cannot be held
responsible for his crimes!

1129
01:47:36,892 --> 01:47:38,476
Not even the state,

1130
01:47:38,769 --> 01:47:41,562
and all of you least of all!

1131
01:47:42,523 --> 01:47:47,403
The state must ensure
that this man is rendered harmless

1132
01:47:47,737 --> 01:47:52,281
so that he ceases to be
a danger to society!

1133
01:47:55,995 --> 01:47:58,288
You never had kids, did ya?

1134
01:47:58,415 --> 01:48:00,499
Then you never lost any either.

1135
01:48:02,127 --> 01:48:04,671
But if you wanna know what it's like

1136
01:48:04,797 --> 01:48:07,799
when a little child is taken from you,

1137
01:48:07,925 --> 01:48:11,219
just ask the parents
whose kids he took away!

1138
01:48:11,971 --> 01:48:17,016
Ask 'em about the days and nights
not knowing what had happened,

1139
01:48:17,768 --> 01:48:20,437
and later,
when they finally found out...

1140
01:48:22,106 --> 01:48:24,567
Why don't you ask the mothers?

1141
01:48:24,735 --> 01:48:27,027
You should ask the mothers!

1142
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:29,363
Think you'd get mercy
from any of them

1143
01:48:29,489 --> 01:48:31,657
for murdering their kids?

1144
01:48:31,826 --> 01:48:33,535
- The woman's right!
- Absolutely!

1145
01:48:33,661 --> 01:48:35,661
No mercy for the killer!

1146
01:48:35,787 --> 01:48:37,496
- Let him have it!
- Slaughter the bastard!

1147
01:48:37,622 --> 01:48:40,499
- Kill the monster!
- Kill him!

1148
01:48:40,667 --> 01:48:42,669
- Put the animal to death!
- Rub him out!

1149
01:48:42,837 --> 01:48:44,713
- Kill him!
- Waste him!

1150
01:48:44,839 --> 01:48:48,675
- Get rid of him!
- Annihilate the monster!

1151
01:48:49,844 --> 01:48:53,181
I will not let you shout me down!

1152
01:48:56,769 --> 01:49:03,357
I will not allow a murder
to be committed in my presence.

1153
01:49:03,692 --> 01:49:06,611
I demand that this human being...

1154
01:49:06,862 --> 01:49:08,154
That's not a human being!

1155
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:11,575
that this human being be afforded
the same protection under the law

1156
01:49:11,826 --> 01:49:13,494
rendered the common criminal!

1157
01:49:13,703 --> 01:49:15,204
Not a chance!

1158
01:49:15,371 --> 01:49:18,875
I demand that he be
handed over to the police!

1159
01:49:19,001 --> 01:49:22,211
The police!
Of all the dumb...

1160
01:49:49,241 --> 01:49:51,075
In the name of the law...

1161
01:50:14,768 --> 01:50:16,435
In the name of the people...

1162
01:50:16,603 --> 01:50:21,190
This will not bring
our children back.

1163
01:50:26,238 --> 01:50:28,197
One has to...

1164
01:50:28,866 --> 01:50:30,700
keep closer watch...

1165
01:50:32,119 --> 01:50:34,788
over the children!

1166
01:50:36,791 --> 01:50:38,292
All of you!
