1
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,326
<i>How did we end up here?</i>

2
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,362
<i>This place is horrible.</i>

3
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,207
<i>Smells like balls.</i>

4
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,407
<i>We don't belong in this shithole.</i>

5
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,566
Shit.

6
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,881
Hey, Sam.

7
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,724
<i>Dad, what kind of--
Shut up!</i>

8
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,410
<i>What kind of flowers did you want?</i>

9
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,410
Alchemillas.
Or something that smells nice.

10
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,604
- Something soothing.
- <i>It all smells like fucking kimchi!</i>

11
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,724
That looks nice.
Anything but roses.

12
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,604
<i>I hate this job.</i>

13
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,765
<i>Riggan, everyone's set for 1-4.</i>

14
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,251
<i>They're ready for you.</i>

15
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,082
<i>Riggan, they're ready for you.</i>

16
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,410
- Mr. Thomson.
- Steve.

17
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,682
- It's Daniel.
- Okay.

18
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,443
Oh, hey, buddy. How you doing?

19
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,082
Pretty good. Yeah, I'd be a lot better
if I could get, uh...

20
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,362
Ralph to stop, you know, acting.

21
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,681
He'll be fine.

22
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,003
And he was yelling,
"I love you, I love you, bitch!"

23
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,929
What do you do with a love like that?

24
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,647
That's not love and you know it.

25
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,767
Why do you insist on calling it love?

26
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,771
Say what you want,
but I know what it was.

27
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,520
What about you, Nick?
Does that sound like love?

28
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,609
Sorry I'm late. Sound like love...

29
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,120
Look, I'm the wrong person to ask.

30
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,363
I only heard the man's name
mentioned in passing.

31
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,449
I wouldn't know.
You'd have to know the particulars.

32
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,126
I think you're saying love is absolute.

33
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,807
Yeah. The kind of love
I'm talking about is...

34
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,530
The kind of love I'm talking about,

35
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,886
you don't try and kill people.

36
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,009
It was love, Mel.
To Eddie, it was.

37
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,730
I don't care what anyone says.

38
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,961
He was ready to die for it.

39
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,506
Ask her what he did after she left him.

40
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,521
He shot himself in the mouth,
but he screwed that up, too.

41
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,726
Poor Ed.

42
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,804
Poor Ed, my ass!
The guy was dangerous!

43
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,401
How did he screw up
shooting himself in the mouth?

44
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,325
He used to carry this .22.
We lived like fugitives then.

45
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,005
Ralph, Ralph, Ralph.

46
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,845
Fugitives are scared, you know?

47
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,163
Fugitives are on the run.

48
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,847
Can you give me more of that?
You know, fear?

49
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,411
Great idea.

50
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,003
We lived like fugitives then.

51
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,891
I never knew if he was going
to come out from behind a bush,

52
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,689
or a car, and just start shooting.

53
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,083
The man was crazy!
He was capable of anything!

54
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,090
Christ, what a nightmare.

55
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,169
He'd call me at the hospital and say:

56
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,206
"Son of a bitch, your days are numbered!"

57
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,488
Too much?
It's a little bit too much.

58
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,040
I can tell, because you--
I just want to give you a range.

59
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,205
Call 911!

60
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,851
Is he breathing?

61
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,122
Is blood coming out of his ear?

62
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,361
Where are you going?

63
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,647
Did someone call 911?

64
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,961
Do not move him!
Wait for an ambulance!

65
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,043
Well, that's a fucking lawsuit.

66
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,282
Where are you going?
The understudy'll be here.

67
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,727
Forget the understudy.
Cancel the first preview.

68
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,883
But it's a full house!
We'd have to refund--

69
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,371
Just do it.

70
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,201
- How's Ralph?
- He'll be fine.

71
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,130
Wait. Will you fucking wait?

72
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,050
Jake, it would have been a disaster.

73
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,724
That guy's the worst actor I've ever seen.

74
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,042
Bleeding's the most honest thing
he's done so far.

75
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,322
He's not that bad!

76
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,404
Okay, he's fucking terrible.

77
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,883
You have the press in your dressing room
in a few hours.

78
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,242
I'll make something up.
I'll think of something, riff.

79
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,446
Hold on.

80
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,242
That wasn't an accident.

81
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,321
What do you mean?

82
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,244
I made it happen.

83
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,925
Oh, okay.

84
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,571
Are you drunk?

85
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,083
Just find me an actor-- a good actor.
Woody Harrelson!

86
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,925
He's doing the next <i>Hunger Games.</i>

87
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,321
Michael Fassbender.

88
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,409
He's doing the prequel
to the <i>X-Men</i> prequel.

89
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,682
- How about, uh, Jeremy Renner?
- Who?

90
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,925
Jeremy Renner! He was nominated.
The <i>Hurt Locker</i> guy.

91
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,605
He's an Avenger.

92
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,686
Fuck! They put him in a cape, too?
I don't care.

93
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,445
Just find me someone.

94
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,287
Ralph will sue us.
He will sue us and he has a case.

95
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,611
Just make it go away.

96
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,602
Look, you're my attorney. You're my producer.
You're my best friend.

97
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,202
Now go out there and do
what you were born to do.

98
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,647
How do you suppose I do that?
How--

99
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,282
<i>Next, an exclusive interview
with Robert Downey, Jr...</i>

100

<i>You listening to me?</i>

111
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,560

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,002
<i>Yeah, embrace it.</i>

113
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,369
<i>But I'm not going away.
You know I'm right.</i>

114
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,044
<i>Look at that.</i>

115
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,882
<i>These people don't know
what you're capable of.</i>

116
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,646
Why would somebody go from playing

117
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,041
the lead in a comic book franchise...

118
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,364
to adapting Raymond Carver for the stage?

119
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,084
As you're probably aware,
Barthes said:

120
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,803
"The cultural work done
in the past by gods and epic sagas..."

121
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,721
"is now being done by laundry
detergent commercials..."

122
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,401
"and comic strip characters."

123
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,843
This is a big leap you've taken.

124
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,084
Yeah, it is.
Absolutely. Absolutely.

125
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,402
Like you said...

126
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,650
that, uh, Barthes said, uh...

127
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,241
Birdman, like Icarus--

128
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,046
Okay, hang on.
Who is this Barthes guy?

129
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,451
Which <i>Birdman</i> was he in?

130
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,411
Uh, Roland Barthes was a French philosopher,

131
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,687
and if you knew anything
about the history of--

132
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,925
Now is it true you've been injecting yourself
with semen from baby pigs?

133
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,761
- I'm sorry, what?
- As a method of facial rejuvenation?

134
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,201
Where did you read that?

135
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,444
It was tweeted by @prostatewhispers.

136
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,921
That's not true.

137
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,047
I know, but did you do it?

138
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,281
No, I didn't do it.

139
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,691
Okay, I'll write you're denying it.

140
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,123
Don't write anything.
Why would you write anything?

141
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,967
Don't write what she said.
I didn't put any baby pig...

142
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,966
Are you at all afraid
that people will say you're doing this play...

143
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,124
to battle the impression
you're a washed-up superhero?

144
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,408
No, absolutely not.
That's why...

145
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,286
twenty years ago,
I said no to <i>Birdman 4.</i>

146
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,485
<i>Birdman 4?</i> You do <i>Birdman 4?!</i>

147
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,167
Thank you for coming out.
Thank you.

148
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,163
We're expecting some great pieces.

149
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,643
The guys in publicity...

150
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,162
want a <i>Times</i> feature,

151
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,811
which is the worst idea right now.

152
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,561
What are you doing?

153
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,766
I don't want to look at this anymore.

154
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,490
That was a present from the crew.

155
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,005
Don't fuck with them--
they're union.

156
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,685
I don't care.

157
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,402
- How'd it go?
- Good.

158
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,364
They talk about Ralph?
He did it.

159
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,851
The motherfucker did it.

160
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,082
Threatened to sue us.

161
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,845
- What'd you say?
- Me?

162
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,606
I said, "Motherfucker,
are you threatening me?"

163
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,762
"If I so much as get
a letter from a lawyer..."

164
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,685
"the press is getting pictures
off your computer."

165
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,081
What pictures?

166
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,364
He has a thing for nuns in diapers.

167
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,526
Why do you care?
Point is, I made it go away.

168
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,205
That's great.

169
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,886
Yeah, it's fantastic,
except for one thing.

170
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,570
We have no actor.

171
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,201
And if we cancel the preview,
the press will smell blood.

172
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,727
We can't afford to lose
any more money.

173
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,291
What do you think I should do?

174
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,885
We hired an understudy.

175
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,200
- Use him.
- No.

176
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,569
Riggan, listen to me.
Please, for the love of God, listen.

177
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,326
Our perfect dream actor
is not going to knock on that door and go,

178
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,362
"Hey, fellas, when do I start?"

179
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,403
- Can I talk to you?
- What's up?

180
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,722
- You find another actor?
- No.

181
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,970
- Mike's available.
- Mike who?

182
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,446
I thought he was doing the thing--

183
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,249
He quit. Or got fired.

184
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,321
Mike who?

185
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,402
- Which is it, quit or fired?
- With Mike, it's usually both.

186
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,324
- Mike fucking who?
- Shiner.

187
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,891
- Yes!
- Jake.

188
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,924
How do you know Mike Shiner?

189
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,240
We share a vagina.

190
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,481
You think he'd do it?

191
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,484
- How do you know?
- He told me.

192
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,131
- Jake.
- Yes.

193
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,089
Ask me if he sells tickets.

194
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,401
Does he sell tickets?

195
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,324
A shitload. Ask me
if the theater critics love him.

196
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,800
Do theater critics love him?

197
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,247
They want to spooge on him.

198
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,409
- Right on his face.
- Everything for a reason.

199
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,921
You think he'd come in this evening?

200
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,809
I'll call and find out.

201
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,485
I'll call his agent.

202
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,161
Amazing, amazing.

203
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,644
Annie? Clear the theater,
send everyone to dinner

204
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,643
and give me some lights!

205
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,201
We've got a put-in tonight.

206
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,361
Who?

207
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,005
You'll find out.

208
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,844
Intimidating, isn't it?

209
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,890
You have any idea the people who have

210
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,009
walked on these boards before you?

211
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,160
Geraldine Page. Helen Hayes.

212
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,491
Jason Robards. Marlon Brando.
And now Riggan Thomson.

213
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,804
Thanks for coming in
on such short notice, Mike.

214
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,491
This is what I do.

215
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,164
You wrote this adaptation?

216
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,561
I did, yeah.

217
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,009
And you're directing and starring.
That's ambitious.

218
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,321
Well, thanks.

219
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,007
Well, it's a good theater.

220
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,167
I can't speak for your play, but...
let's do a little bit of it.

221
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,562
Oh, I didn't expect you
to just jump right in.

222
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,320
It's first preview tomorrow night.
Let's get to work.

223
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,406
Well, feel free to take the script
up until you feel comfortable.

224
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,160
No, let's just do some of it.

225
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,931
Take a look at page 20.

226
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,685
I'm good. I don't need it.

227
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,126
I don't need the script.
Give me a cue.

228
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,361
What?

229
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,984
Feed me a line.

230
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,681
Feed me a line.

231
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,841
Okay.

232
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,362
Okay, uh, let me think.

233
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,524
I'm the wrong person to ask.
I didn't actually know him.

234
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,961
I only heard his name mentioned in passing.

235
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,644
You'd have to know the particulars.

236
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,048
But I think what you're saying is
love is absolute.

237
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,782
Is that what I'm saying?
Am I saying love is absolute?

238
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,203
Yes. Okay, yeah!
The kind of love

239
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,884
I'm talking about is absolute.

240
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,886
The kind of love I'm talking about,
you don't try to kill people!

241
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,804
How do you know the lines?

242
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,508
It's a thing I have.
I don't know, it's a gift.

243
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,404
Come on. I've been helping Lesley
get off book for a month.

244
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,041
- These lines are right here.
- That makes sense.

245
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,970
That's good.
Give me my cue again.

246
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,720
I'm the wrong person to ask.
I didn't actually know him.

247
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,725
I only heard his name
mentioned in passing.

248
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,406
You never know the particulars.
I think what--

249
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,483
Can I make a suggestion?

250
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,244
- Do you mind?
- No, not at all.

251
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,087
No, no, forget that.
Just stay with me.

252
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,086
"I'm the wrong person to ask,"
he says, but what's the intention?

253
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,243
Is he fed up with the subject?

254
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,004
Deflecting guilt over the marriage?

255
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,447
And here's the thing--
you have four lines after that

256
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,245
that all say the same thing.
"I didn't know him."

257
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,807
"I only heard his name
mentioned in passing."

258
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,086
"I wouldn't know."

259
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,765
"You'd have to know the particulars."

260
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,002
"Particulars" sounds like my grandmother.

261
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,921
The point is, you don't know the guy.
We fucking get it.

262
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,611
Make it work with one line.

263
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,762
"I didn't even know the man." Right?

264
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,930
Wait-- You know my lines, too, huh?

265
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,442
Can we not get hung up on knowing lines?

266
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,602
Can we just work on this?
Tear it apart?

267
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,127
So why don't you just give me
that same thing again,

268
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,762
but cut it down. Try it.

269
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,965
I'm the wrong person to ask--

270
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,124
Oh, no! That's the thing--
"I'm the wrong person to ask."

271
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,201
I think it's, "Fuck you."

272
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,807
"Fuck you. Don't put me on the spot."

273
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,805
"Don't make me feel
self-conscious about my marriage"

274
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,882
"while my wife is sitting..."

275
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,804
- Right there.
- "right there."

276
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,487
- Can I sit down for this?
- Yeah, sit. Good idea.

277
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,327
So just give it to me as a "Fuck you."
Lay it on me.

278
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,971
Just do it. Give it to me.

279
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,561
- Well, I'm thinking.
- Fuck me hard. Just give it.

280
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,801
Come on! Just do it!

281
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,088
Hey, I'm the wrong person to ask!

282
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,083
I don't even know him.
What's your point?!

283
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,288
- What's my point?
- Yeah, what are you saying?

284
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,486
Spit it out!

285
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,803
You're saying what?
You're saying love is absolute.

286
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,570
Yes! Yes!

287
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,769
The kind of love that I'm talking about,
it is absolute!

288
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,570
The kind of love that I'm talking about,

289
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,846
you don't...

290
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,321
you don't try to kill people.

291
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,171
Yeah. Good.

292
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,045
I don't know--
what do you think, boss?

293
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,691
You want to do this with me?

294
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,525
What do you think?

295
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,445
Everybody's back.
Larry needs to see him for a fitting.

296
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,286
I'll take that as a yes.

297
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,365
So, who are you?

298
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,021
That's Sam, my daughter.

299
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,691
That's amazing.
You don't look anything like each other.

300
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,046
What do you do?

301
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,522
She's my assistant. Works with me.

302
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,525
And does she talk and speak?

303
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,291
She does. Yeah.

304
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,887
She can even sit or stay or roll over,
if you have any treats.

305
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,725
Welcome aboard, Mike!

306
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,040
Thank you, Captain.

307
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,731
I'm Mike... Shiner.

308
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,291
Oh, I know who you are.

309
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,928
I, uh, saw you in <i>Hothouse</i>
at the Geffen.

310
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,047
You were great.

311
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,771
Oh, thank you.
Your ass is great.

312
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,721
Dude. Seriously?

313
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,165
That was just me--

314
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,402
Larry? Larry?

315
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,086
This is the theater, sweetheart.

316
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,400
Don't be so self-conscious.

317
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,721
He's here.

318
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,241
Thank the Lord and pass the biscuits.

319
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,321
I finally have an actor to dress.

320
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,607
How are you, Larry?

321
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,921
Better now you're here.
Take off your clothes.

322
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,331
You're just going to stand there?

323
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,086
This is the theater, honey.
Don't be so self-conscious.

324
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,325
We have to start from scratch
with less than 24 hours.

325
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,931
Here. Try these--

326
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,607
Holy shi--!
Where are your underpants?

327
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,002
Under the bed at home, I think.

328
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,923
No. Okay, okay.
Everything's too small.

329
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,411
You're not kidding.

330
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,490
That's nice.

331
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,927
Forgive him, Larry.
Mike's like my 5-year-old son.

332
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,531
Neither of them has clean underwear.

333
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,127
Or pubic hair, I imagine.

334
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,680
I can alter the suit,

335
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,081
but we're going to have to make
new trousers and shirts.

336
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,446
And underwear.

337
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,443
- What are you doing?
- Waiting on Larry.

338
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,806
I'm finished!

339
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,361
Then I'm just standing here
with my cock out.

340
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,601
Well, get dressed.

341
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,291
Riggan's daughter is hanging around--
she might walk in here.

342
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,766
You haven't seen her.

343
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,640
She's always around, watching everyone,
like Little Miss Creepy.

344
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,486
I don't know if drugs fried her brain or what...

345
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,882
but I don't want her
running to her father

346
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,041
saying you showed her your junk.

347
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,328
Then we should ask her to leave.

348
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,610
Oh, God. Really?

349
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,484
- Sammy?
- It's Sam.

350
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,722
Sam... Lesley.

351
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,651
Listen, what I said--

352
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,884
Oh, don't worry about it.
He's a handful, huh?

353
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,403
How do you always manage to find
a new way to humiliate me?

354
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,563
Oh, to be fair, you make it really easy.

355
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,171
What was she doing here?

356
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,084
- She brought me down.
- And stayed?

357
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,641
Well, she is a little... something.

358
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,844
This is Broadway.
And I'm here, finally.

359
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,481
Now, please, do me a favor,
I'm begging you--

360
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,761
don't fuck it up!

361
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,241
Lesley.

362
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,729
Come here. Come here.

363
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,443
Play with my balls.

364
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,987
Don't do it.

365
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,441
Just sign it.

366
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,681
- Listen--
- No, you listen to me!

367
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,921
I can't afford to listen to you.

368
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,411
I have to go shopping again.

369
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,766
Just sew something, you old fuck!

370
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,365
Give him whatever he wants!

371
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,680
It's four times what we paid
what's-his-name!

372
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,251
Go into the reserve.

373
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,766
It's gone!
We spent it on fog and fake trees...

374
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,041
It's a dream sequence.

375
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,645
And dancing midgets!

376
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,131
You can't say "midget" anymore.

377
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,691
The reserve is gone!

378
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,282
You didn't see what I just saw.

379
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,722
I'm telling you,
this guy's the real deal.

380
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,961
I can feel it.

381
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,889
He's the actor we've been waiting for.

382
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,928
Come on. Just get the contract done.

383
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,480
Please, Jake. I'll get the money.

384
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,970
Okay, I'll do it.

385
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,202
Stop smiling. You're freaking me out.

386
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,811
Sorry. You're right.

387
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,050
Is it true? Shiner?

388
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,560
Holy shit. When can I meet him?

389
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,801
He's with Larry now.

390
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,923
I'm going to Starbucks.
Want anything?

391
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,087
I'm good.

392
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,800
She has a great ass.
I have news for you, too.

393
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,162
Is it good or bad?
'Cause I really--

394
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,702
I missed my last two periods.

395
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,163
I think it's really happening.

396
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,243
Is that good or bad? Riggan!

397
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,163
It's good. It's great.

398
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:48,823
Say something else.

399
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,564
You sure it's mine?

400
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,685
Well, you know, there's you,

401
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,683
there's Jake, the masseur wore a condom...

402
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,643
yeah, I'm pretty sure it's yours.

403
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,366
Idiot.

404
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,207
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

405
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,531
Me, too.

406
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,523
You're not funny!

407
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,887
What? Hey, what?

408
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,407
First preview tomorrow.

409
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,884
Here we go.

410
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,244
I rode with him in the ambulance
to the hospital.

411
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,324
I will never get that image
out of my head.

412
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,406
Right before he did it,
his eyes were so sad and lonely.

413
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,324
Did you have to treat him?

414
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,004
I didn't have to, but I did.

415
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,562
Music out. Cue 34, 35 ready.

416
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,251
He was in terrible shape.

417
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,766
His head swelled to twice the size
of a normal head.

418
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,082
- He's good, huh?
- He's incredible.

419
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,243
I think he's drinking real gin.

420
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,601
What?

421
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,605
Ask Nick. I want you to ask Nick
if he thinks that's love.

422
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,525
Oh, honey, can't we just go to dinner?

423
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,603
Mel, don't get him started.

424
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,002
You don't know how he's been lately.

425
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,162
He's been depressed. I've been worried.

426
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,771
You've been what?

427
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,130
Let me tell you guys something about real love.
I'll tell you something.

428
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,602
We all should be ashamed

429
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,603
when we talk like we know
what we're talking about...

430
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,364
when we talk about love.

431
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,602
Oh, for God's sake,
are you getting drunk?

432
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,364
I don't have to be drunk
to say what I think.

433
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,670
We're not drunk.
We're having a few drinks.

434
00:22:46,676 --> 00:22:47,351
Exactly.

435
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,930
You've had more than a few.

436
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,047
What, are you counting?

437
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,124
Leave her alone. If you're not drunk,
don't talk like you are.

438
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,725
Shut up!

439
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,521
Do me a favor. For once in your life,

440
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,648
honest to God, shut up for a minute.

441
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,645
Anyway, like I was saying...

442
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,805
you want to know about real love,
there's this old couple...

443
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,327
had a car wreck, out on the interstate.

444
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,644
Some drunk kid plowed his old man's pickup...

445
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,004
right into their camper.

446
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,960
By the time I got down
to the hospital, this kid,

447
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,486
this fucking teenager, was dead.

448
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,166
So we took the old couple up to the O.R.

449
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,324
We worked like hell on them
through most of the night.

450
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,005
By the time we were done with them,
we just, you know...

451
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,688
wrapped them in full body casts.

452
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,001
The husband, the old man...

453
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,527
was depressed for the longest time.

454
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,285
Even after I said to him,

455
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,762
"Your wife's going to pull through",
he was still depressed.

456
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,524
So, I went up to the mouth hole
and I asked him.

457
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,364
And he told me it was because
he couldn't see her...

458
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,203
through the eyes.
Couldn't see his wife.

459
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,884
Can you imagine?

460
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,841
I'm telling you,
this guy's heart was breaking because...

461
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,123
He couldn't turn his goddamn head

462
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,725
and just look at his goddamn wife.

463
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,405
Shit.

464
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,405
I mean, it was killing this guy.

465
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,324
I am so tired of this.
Is this water?

466
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,880
It was killing him.

467
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,045
Did you replace my gin with water, man?

468
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,731
Mike, come on.

469
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,405
- "Come on," what?
- You're drunk.

470
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,087
Yes, I'm drunk. I'm supposed to be drunk!
Why aren't you drunk?

471
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,367
This is Carver!

472
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,920
He left a piece of his liver on the table
each time he wrote a page!

473
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,642
If I need to be drinking gin,
who the fuck are you to touch my gin?

474
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,604
You fucked with the period,

475
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,563
you fucked with the plot
so you'd get the best lines.

476
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,320
Leave me the fucking tools that I need!

477
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,762
Oh, come on, people,
don't be so pathetic.

478
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,446
Stop viewing the world
through your cell phone screen!

479
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,607
Have a real experience!

480
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,764
Does anybody give a shit
about the truth other than me?

481
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,367
This set is fake, the bananas are fake.

482
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,011
There's nothing in this milk carton!

483
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,761
Your performance is fake.

484
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,083
The only thing that's real on this stage
is this chicken.

485
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,681
So I'm going to work with the chicken.

486
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,451
That was interesting.

487
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,761
Bring the curtain down.

488
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,610
That's good bird, man!

489
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,965
Get him out of here!

490
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,884
How do you want me to do that?

491
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,441
Hey, wait.

492
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,449
- I want him gone.
- No!

493
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,131
We cannot do that!

494
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,531
Of course we can! It's our show!

495
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,451
- Listen to me.
- No, you listen to me.

496
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,563
Get him the fuck out of my play.

497
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,041
It was a preview!
Nobody gives a shit!

498
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,884
Nothing matters until that old bat from

499
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,962
the <i>New York Times</i> comes opening night!

500
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,201
We're getting rid of him.

501
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,962
Shut up!
Shut up and listen to me for once!

502
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,802
As soon as we announced he was taking over,
the advance doubled.

503
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,247
We can't afford to lose any more money

504
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,970
and we can't afford to lose Mike.

505
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,566
This is about being respected
and validated, remember?

506
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,801
That's what you told me!

507
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,481
That's how you got me into this shit!

508
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,844
Now, you're the director.
Get him under control.

509
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,001
Fuck.

510
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,482
This isn't the '90s anymore.

511
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,844
Your zipper's down.

512
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,001
Fuck.

513
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,685
You were really good, <i>cabrón.</i>

514
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,169
Out in front of the theater in ten minutes!

515
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,810
Don't overthink it.

516
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,045
What the hell was going on up there?

517
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,484
I didn't know you were here tonight.

518
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,882
That guy's an asshole, huh?

519
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,891
What are you doing here?

520
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,044
Sam and I are going to grab a bite
after she's finished.

521
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,970
No, I mean here. Now.

522
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,244
Well, I know how much this means to you.

523
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,881
Thanks. I appreciate that.

524
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,890
So what's happening?

525
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,446
With the play? You saw what.

526
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,806
No. You and Sam.

527
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,565
Oh, you know, it's great.

528
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,561
It's the same.

529
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,046
Do you talk to her?

530
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,202
Yeah, we talk.

531
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,484
It's just been so crazy around here, you know?

532
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,364
You understand where her head is at.

533
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,601
Of course.

534
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,002
She's trying to stay away
from everything and everyone

535
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,845
that got her into rehab
in the first place.

536
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,447
I know. I really do. I get it.

537
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,523
That's all she's had,
so she's confused.

538
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,840
Yeah, I get it.

539
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,447
I know you're caught up
in all this stuff, but--

540
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,660
"Stuff"?

541
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,770
You know what I mean.

542
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,567
Riggan, you don't have to be
a great father right now.

543
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,608
You just have to be one.

544
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,445
Oh, sorry.

545
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,610
How's that going?

546
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,885
I'd rather not talk about it.

547
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,451
You're drinking?

548
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,450
Yeah, I'm having a beer.

549
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,441
So...

550
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,805
what's going on with you?

551
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,345
Me?

552
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,971
Nothing.

553
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,121
Everything's the same, I guess.

554
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,724
I'm going back to teaching.

555
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,961
Oh, yeah?

556
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,644
I'm thinking of refinancing the Malibu house.

557
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,571
What? I'm sorry.

558
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,961
I'm thinking of refinancing--

559
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,323
No, I heard you.
I just need a second.

560
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,482
That's going to be Sam's house.

561
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,610
Why would you...? For this play?

562
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,650
I need the money.

563
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,844
Do you have any idea
how crazy that sounds?

564
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,006
What do you want me to say?
My health lasted longer than the money.

565
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,320
Go figure that out.

566
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,170
What's going on?

567
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,527
Riggan, look at me.

568
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,001
I got a chance to do something right.

569
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,011
I got to take it. I got to.

570
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,206
It's funny. I was sitting here,
waiting for you...

571
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,967
and all of a sudden,
I couldn't remember why we broke up.

572
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,045
You know, the last time
I flew here from L.A...

573
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,202
George Clooney was sitting
two seats in front of me...

574
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,729
with a nice pair of cufflinks
and that fucking chin.

575
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,409
We ended up flying through this really,
really horrible storm.

576
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,326
I mean, the plane was rattling and shaking.

577
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,408
And all the people on board are,
you know, crying.

578
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,405
I mean, crying. Praying, right?

579
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,404
I just sat there.

580
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,721
They're crying, I sit there.

581
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,560
And I'm thinking, "Oh, boy..."

582
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,083
"the next morning,
when Sam looks at the paper..."

583
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,246
"it's going to be Clooney's face
on the front page, not mine."

584
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,561
You know? Boom.

585
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,728
Did you know Farrah Fawcett died

586
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,610
the exact same day as Michael Jackson?

587
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,444
Is that crazy?

588
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,770
Why did we break up?

589
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,520
Because you threw a kitchen knife at me...

590
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,969
and an hour later,
were telling me how much you loved me.

591
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,366
Just because I didn't like that ridiculous comedy
you did with Goldie Hawn...

592
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,443
did not mean I did not love you.

593
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,849
That's what you always do--

594
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,366
you confuse love for admiration.

595
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,689
It's your house--
do what you want with it.

596
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,569
Just be there for our daughter.

597
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,131
I will.

598
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,962
You're not Farrah Fawcett, Riggan.

599
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,961
<i>We should have done that reality show--</i>
The Thomsons.

600
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,161
Shut up.

601
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,571
- <i>That would've been good.</i>
- Shut up!

602
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,010
<i>Crazy, druggy, wise-ass daughter,
MILF-y wife with perky tits.</i>

603
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,322
<i>People would've wanted to see that.</i>

604
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,562
- Shut up.
- <i>More than this piece of shit.</i>

605
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,847
Shut up!

606
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,410
The sun bed is here.

607
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,481
What does that mean?

608
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,845
It means there's a sun bed out there
being delivered to in here.

609
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,241
Who ordered a sun bed?

610
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,050
Mike. He said it's for his character--

611
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,088
part of his process and that shit.

612
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,522
He said he has to be a redneck.

613
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,444
Son of a bitch.

614
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,851
Let's go. Walk.

615
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,082
- Where are we going?
- To get you coffee.

616
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,681
- Did I do something to disrespect you?
- Not yet.

617
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,685
- I have a lot riding on this play.
- Oh, is that right?

618
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,048
Yeah. People know who I am, and--

619
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,601
Bullshit. They don't know you, your work.

620
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,171
They know the guy from the bird suit

621
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,971
who tells coy,
slightly vomitous stories on <i>Letterman.</i>

622
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,611
Well, I'm sorry if I'm popular.

623
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,723
Popular? I don't give a shit.

624
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,443
Popularity is the slutty little cousin
of prestige, my friend.

625
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,641
Okay, I don't even know
what the fuck that means.

626
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,724
It means, my reputation is riding on this,
and that's worth a, a...

627
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,044
- A lot.
- A lot, exactly! Fuck you. Yes!

628
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,805
If this doesn't work out for you,

629
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,644
you fuck off back to your studio pals...

630
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,884
and dive back into that cultural genocide
you guys perpetrate.

631
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,770
A douchebag's born every minute!

632
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,491
That was P.T. Barnum's premise
when he invented the circus...

633
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,725
and nothing has changed.
You guys know if you crank out toxic crap...

634
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,928
people will line up and pay to see it!

635
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,811
But long after you're gone,
I'll be on that stage...

636
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,809
earning my living, baring my soul,

637
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,400
wrestling with complex emotions,
'cause that's what we do.

638
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,405
Oh, so that's what tonight was about?

639
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,766
You wrestling with complex emotion?

640
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,482
Tonight was about seeing
if it's even alive, if it can bleed.

641
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,924
This isn't a backlot, Riggan, this is New York City.
This is how we do things.

642
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,525
Where are you going?

643
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,763
They have coffee here.

644
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,604
Thanks, Tommy.

645
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,205
They were laughing at us.

646
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,920
Tonight they were laughing,
tomorrow they'll be tweeting.

647
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,451
Who cares?

648
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,523
These are people who pay half price

649
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,841
to watch us rehearse. Stop caring.

650
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,281
This play's a drama. It's about--

651
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,284
- You don't know what the play's about.
- I do know.

652
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,205
No, you don't.
That's what previews are for.

653
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,885
That's why they call them previews.

654
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,442
That's where you figure out
what the play is.

655
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,291
Okay, look, look. Listen to me.

656
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,006
You see the woman at the end of the bar?

657
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,202
The one who looks like she licked
a homeless man's ass?

658
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,447
Yeah.

659
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,046
All that matters is what she writes about us
in 500 words in the <i>Times.</i>

660
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,487
- That's, uh...
- Tabitha Dickinson, yes.

661
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,327
The only opinion that matters
in New York theater is hers.

662
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,326
If she likes us, we run.
If she doesn't, we're fucked.

663
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,927
She does look like she licked
a homeless guy's ass.

664
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,525
Do me a favor.

665
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,649
Don't get your panties in a twist
over a preview, like some rookie...

666
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,404
and don't tell me how to do my job.

667
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,405
This is my town and to be honest,

668
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,845
people don't give a shit about you here.

669
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,606
- You're Riggan Thomson, right?
- Sorry to interrupt.

670
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,525
Would you mind having a picture with us here?

671
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,525
Would you mind?

672
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,330
The button's on the bottom.

673
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,366
- Who is this guy?
- He used to be Birdman.

674
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,525
Oh, you're such a doll. Thank you.
You're so sweet.

675
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,990
Handsome.

676
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,364
Okay, sweetheart, come on.

677
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,691
Are we good here?

678
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,045
I'm going to go home.

679
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,883
All right. See you tomorrow.

680
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,724
I want to know something.

681
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,370
Why Raymond Carver?

682
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,884
I was a kid, in high school...

683
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,727
doing a play in Syracuse,
and he was in the audience.

684
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,408
And he sent this back afterwards.

685
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,561
A little note.

686
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,087
"Thank you for an honest performance.
Ray Carver."

687
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,721
That's when I knew
I was going to be an actor.

688
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,921
Right there.

689
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,765
What's so funny?

690
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,002
It's just on a cocktail napkin.

691
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,401
So?

692
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,082
He was fucking drunk, man.

693
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,243
You headed to Hollywood, Mike?

694
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,761
No.

695
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,447
Hollywood's heading here, Tabby.

696
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,603
Good luck with that.

697
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,522
"A man becomes a critic"

698
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,931
"when he cannot be an artist..."

699
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,046
"the same way a man becomes an informer
when he cannot be a soldier."

700
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,931
That's Flaubert, right?

701
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,443
He's a Hollywood clown
in a Lycra bird suit.

702
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,410
Yes, he is.

703
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,766
But tomorrow night at 8:00...

704
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,805
he's going out on that stage
and risking everything.

705
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,965
What will you be doing?

706
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,364
Don't you ever worry
that I'll give you a bad review?

707
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,450
I'm sure you will...

708
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,121
if I ever give you a bad performance.

709
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,811
Miss Dickinson.

710
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,804
Mr. Shiner.

711
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,210
What are you still doing here?

712
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,646
Nothing.

713
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,201
Nothing. Your costumes are hanging
in your dressing room.

714
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,891
Oh, great. Great.

715
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,566
Oh, I got that coconut water you wanted.

716
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,087
If you want the face stuff,
it's not open till tomorrow.

717
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,207
What?

718
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,724
I'm not sure that I said thank you.

719
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,161
For what?

720
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,405
Everything. You've been doing
a really good job, honestly.

721
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,803
I've been so preoccupied with all the...

722
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,087
Okay, well, I just wanted to say that.

723
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,765
What is that?

724
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,091
That smell.

725
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,922
What is it?
Look at me. Look at me!

726
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,161
What? What?

727
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,768
You've got to be shitting me.
Where is it?

728
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,762
Can we not do this, please?

729
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,241
Dad?

730
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,285
Where is it?
I can't believe this.

731
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,691
What is this?

732
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,125
Chunky peanut butter.

733
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,927
This. This. What is that?

734
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,602
That's pot. Relax.

735
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,440
- "Relax." You can't do this to me.
- To you?

736
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,364
You know what I'm talking about.

737
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,284
Oh, yeah, you! What else is new?

738
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,442
- Don't do that thing where you--
- Make it about me? Never!

739
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,364
I'm trying to do something important!

740
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,726
This is not important!

741
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,131
It's important to me!

742
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,046
Maybe not to you
or your cynical friends

743
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,441
whose only ambition is to "go viral"...

744
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,805
but to me...
God, this is my career!

745
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,960
It's my chance to finally do work
that means something.

746
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,202
That means something to who?

747
00:39:47,502--> 00:39:50,484
You had a career, Dad,
before the third comic book movie.

748
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,963
Before people started to forget
who was inside that bird costume.

749
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,801
You are doing a play based
on a book written 60 years ago...

750
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,242
for a thousand rich old white people...

751
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,642
whose only concern is where to have
cake and coffee afterwards!

752
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,401
Nobody gives a shit but you!

753
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,007
And, let's face it, Dad...

754
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,890
you are not doing this
for the sake of art,

755
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,566
you're doing it to feel relevant again.

756
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,411
Well, guess what?
There's an entire world of people

757
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,403
who fight to be relevant
every single day!

758
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,523
And you act like it doesn't exist.

759
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,081
Things that are happening
in a place you ignore...

760
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,529
that has already forgotten about you!

761
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,286
I mean, who the fuck are you?!

762
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,522
You hate bloggers, you mock Twitter.

763
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,842
You don't even have a Facebook page!

764
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,604
It's you who doesn't exist!

765
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,002
You're doing this
because you're terrified,

766
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,202
like the rest of us,
that you don't matter.

767
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,284
And you know what? You're right!
You don't!

768
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,889
It's not important, okay?
You're not important-- get used to it!

769
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,881
Dad.

770
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,125
In the days before Nick's depression
started to eat away at him...

771
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,725
he never knew I was pregnant,

772
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,121
and I never intended to tell him.

773
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,689
I guess we make choices in life,

774
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,127
and we choose to live with them.

775
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,485
Or not.

776
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,289
I didn't want that baby.

777
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,724
Not because I didn't love Nick,

778
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,121
and not because I didn't love
the idea of it...

779
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,803
but just because I wasn't ready
to love myself.

780
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,323
There's a distance to it all now.

781
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,008
A wistful distance,
underscored by a gentle breeze...

782
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,401
Actors in position.

783
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,641
And the sound of birds...

784
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,967
Music out.

785
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,088
laughing at the whimsy of it all.

786
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,164
- Lesley?
- What?

787
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,084
I think I'm hard.

788
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,767
No, it's just sometimes you don't consider
other people's feelings.

789
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,401
No, no. I'm getting hard-- feel that.

790
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,847
What?! You've got to be kidding.

791
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,241
Let's really do it. Let's fuck.

792
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,401
No, are you crazy?!

793
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,330
It'll be incredible!
It'll be real.

794
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,921
Cut it out! I'm serious, Mike.

795
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,527
Don't call me Mike. Call me Mel.

796
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,971
Get off!

797
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,522
Terri! Terri!

798
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,524
Terri, I know you're in there!

799
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,842
Get off me! Get off!

800
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,771
- Ed?
- Why?

801
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,042
- What are you doing here?
- Just tell me why.

802
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,362
Take it easy, okay? I know this is hard.

803
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,443
Shut up! Shut--

804
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,362
- Shut up!
- Just don't do anything stupid.

805
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,205
Eddie, please!

806
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,363
What's the matter with me?
Why do I always have to beg people to love me?

807
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,882
Eddie, please, give me the gun.

808
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,565
Look at me.

809
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,043
I was drowning.
I'm just not capable of--

810
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,045
You deserve to be loved, Eddie.
You do.

811
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,562
I just wanted to be what you wanted.

812
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,644
Now I spend every fucking minute praying

813
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,246
to be somebody else.
Somebody I'm not!

814
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,721
Anybody.

815
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,563
Just put the gun down, Ed.
She doesn't love you anymore.

816
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,571
You don't, do you?

817
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,086
No.

818
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,251
And you never will.

819
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,244
I'm sorry.

820
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,243
I don't exist.

821
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,085
I'm not even here.

822
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,610
None of this even matters. I don't exist.
I don't exist.

823
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,242
- Ed...
- I don't exist.

824
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,762
Ed! Eddie, Eddie, don't do that!

825
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,770
You're such an asshole!

826
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,610
What? That's the best you've been.

827
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,286
Why would you do that?!
We were onstage!

828
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,205
What the fuck?!
It's like my head was a jar of Bolognese!

829
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,124
I'll fix the blood rig.

830
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,283
--they're fucking in a motel room.

831
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,045
You can't get it up in six months

832
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,804
and now you want to fuck me
in front of 800 strangers?!

833
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,123
I need it to feel real, okay?
I need that intensity.

834
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,442
Oh, fuck you!

835
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,041
I was in the moment.
I thought you were, too.

836
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,285
I'm sorry.

837
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,644
I told you to stop, you fucking animal.

838
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,810
You were brilliant.

839
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,482
What is wrong with you?!

840
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,847
I want your shit out of the apartment.

841
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:49,006
What? Hey, no, wait. Look, look,
I'm sorry. Can we just--

842
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,847
No, we can't, Mike!
Maybe up here, you're Mr. Truth...

843
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,925
but in the real world, where it counts,
you're a fucking fraud!

844
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,162
How's that for truth, you dick?!

845
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,362
- What's wrong?
- He's an asshole.

846
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,487
What'd he do now?

847
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,768
Oh, nothing, just try to fuck me
in front of the audience!

848
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,205
- Oh, my God!
- Right?

849
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,771
That's kind of hot!

850
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,044
Why don't I have any self-respect?!

851
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,362
You're an actress, honey.

852
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,364
I'm pathetic!

853
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,885
Look at me.

854
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,569
You know, I've always dreamed
of being a Broadway actress...

855
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,363
since I was a little kid.
And now I'm here, and I'm...

856
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,688
I'm not a Broadway actress,

857
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,411
I'm still just a little kid.

858
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,726
And I keep waiting for someone
to tell me I made it.

859
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,904
You made it.

860
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,571
I did?

861
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,166
Sadly, it was with Mike Shiner
on a fake motel bed in front of 800 people.

862
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,531
Shut up.

863
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,160
Hey, is she okay?

864
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,765
She'll be fine.

865
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,242
Look, none of this is your fault, okay?

866
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,402
You're beautiful and you're talented...

867
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,442
and I'm lucky to have you.

868
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,521
Okay?

869
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,445
Okay.

870
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,602
That was kind of sweet.

871
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,121
Yeah.

872
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,691
What's wrong?

873
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,691
Nothing. Two years,
and he's never said anything like that to me.

874
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,805
You're beautiful and you're talented...

875
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,647
and I'm lucky to have you. Okay?

876
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,485
We're gross.

877
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,051
We are.

878
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,642
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

879
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,490
Do it again.

880
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,411
Can we discuss this
like two mature artists?

881
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,005
What is the big deal about--

882
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,685
Fuck you!

883
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,525
You're not ready yet. That's fine.

884
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,003
Fuck. Actresses.

885
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,522
They drive me fucking crazy.

886
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,046
Riggan?

887
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,205
Your gun is ridiculous.
I can see the red plug in the barrel...

888
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,286
so you look like a kid with a plastic toy
when you point it at me.

889
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,524
I don't feel threatened at all.

890
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,443
Get a better one.
Have some self-respect.

891
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,521
Please.

892
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,046
Hey, apart from that, uh...

893
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,040
I thought it was a pretty fun crowd, huh?

894
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,722
I don't think it's high enough.

895
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,571
Me, neither.

896
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,925
What are you doing up here?

897
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,410
Uh, adrenaline.

898
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,484
I just got out of rehab.
It's the closest thing I get to a drug.

899
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,524
You went to rehab?

900
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,321
Cool.

901
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,048
It wasn't all Dr. Drew or anything,

902
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:12,090
but that dude from <i>American Pie</i> was there.

903
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,361
Jump!

904
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,931
Eat me!

905
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,242
Okay, then jump on my face!

906
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,123
I love this city.

907
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,921
Yeah?

908
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,049
Why do you act like a dick all the time?

909
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,963
Do you just do it to antagonize people?

910
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,805
Maybe.

911
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,044
You really don't give a shit
if people like you or not.

912
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,611
Not really.

913
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,130
That's cool.

914
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,125
Is it? I don't know.

915
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,961
What?

916
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,566
Let's play a game.

917
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,642
A game? What are you, eight?

918
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,644
What are you, 78?

919
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,963
- Truth or dare.
- Oh, come on.

920
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,690
Truth or dare?

921
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,321
Truth.

922
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:08,328
When we first met,
you made a comment about my ass.

923
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,490
Why did you do that?

924
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:16,325
You have a terrific ass,
and I noticed that.

925
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,842
And I just commented on it.

926
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,682
- Truth or dare?
- Dare.

927
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,684
- Really?
- Yeah.

928
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,608
There's a bald guy and he's going
to walk right under you.

929
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,011
Spit on his head.

930
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,010
- No.
- You said dare.

931
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,766
- Truth.
- No, it's too late.

932
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,645
- Happy?
- Yeah.

933
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,045
Truth or dare?

934
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,203
- Truth.
- You're boring.

935
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,442
The truth is always interesting.

936
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,042
You want to fool around with me?

937
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,201
No.

938
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,361
Really?

939
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,281
Why not?

940
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,564
- That's a second question.
- It's a second part.

941
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,722
I'd be afraid I couldn't get it up.

942
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,042
That didn't seem to be
a problem for you onstage.

943
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:30,721
Nothing is a problem for me onstage.

944
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,969
I want to ask another question.

945
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,087
You already did.

946
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,402
- One more.
- Go ahead.

947
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:43,404
If you weren't afraid,
what would you want to do to me?

948
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,401
I'd pull your eyes out of your head...

949
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,445
That's sweet.

950
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,444
and put them in my own skull...

951
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,811
and look around,
so I could see the street

952
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,769
the way I used to when I was your age.

953
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,360
Good night.

954
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,002
Don't kill the messenger.

955
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,844
He's an asshole.

956
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,681
<i>I told you.</i>

957
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,330
You fucking prick.

958
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,931
<i>He's playing you.</i>

959
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,446
This is it?

960
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,843
Page 12. Page 12.

961
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,966
"Riggan Thomson,
best known as the face of Birdman,"

962
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,520
"tries not to lay an egg on Broadway."

963
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,127
- Where's the rest of it?
- There is no rest of it.

964
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:37,286
Don't worry-- it'll be used
to scoop up dog shit tomorrow.

965
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,170
How can you be so calm?

966
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,526
What are my other choices?

967
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,127
- Aren't you scared at all?
- About what?

968
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,044
About being humiliated out there!

969
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,442
It won't be the first time
I've been humiliated.

970
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,290
Well, of course it won't.

971
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,565
You're an asshole.

972
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,166
And by the way, I'm not pregnant,

973
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,641
so there's one thing
not to worry about.

974
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,049
<i>Forget about her.</i>

975
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,688
<i>He stole your front page.</i>

976
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,730
<i>He's stealing your show.
He thinks you're a joke.</i>

977
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,720
<i>Now two million people agree with him.</i>

978
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,006
<i>Maybe you are, Riggan.
Maybe that's what you are-- a joke.</i>

979
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,606
What the hell is going on?

980
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,445
- Get up!
- That hurts!

981
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,011
- Get up!
- Back away!

982
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,930
So Carver's the reason you
became an actor, huh?

983
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,123
Listen, this is my fucking show.

984
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,603
I did the work, I raised the money
and I arrange the press!

985
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:02,890
Oh, Jesus.
They called me for an interview.

986
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:06,283
I told them the first thing
that came into my head.

987
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,523
We got the cover of the Arts section!

988
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,443
Fuck the Arts section!

989
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,484
You told them the first thing
that came into your head?

990
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,891
Right.

991
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,088
You're Mr. Natural. Mr. Fuck-the-scene-

992
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,685
just-stare-at-my-massive-hard-on.

993
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,727
That's truth.

994
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,881
You think it looked massive?

995
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,531
Shut the fuck up.

996
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,807
You don't get hard on my stage
unless I tell you to.

997
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,487
Your stage?
Oh, let me tell you something.

998
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,884
This stage has belonged to a lot of great actors,
but you are not one of them.

999
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,804
So you wrote your own lines, huh?

1000
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,491
I did, actually.

1001
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,246
You wrote a few changes and mumbled,
you self-absorbed prick.

1002
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,731
I'm self-absorbed? Look at you.

1003
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,245
You nobody piece of shit!

1004
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,643
Nobody? My massive hard-on
got 50,000 views on YouTube.

1005
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,571
A cat playing with a dildo
gets more than that.

1006
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,490
- I don't care.
- Yes, you do! You care.

1007
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,161
- I'm a theater actor.
- I don't give a shit. You care.

1008
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,765
Everybody says,
"Oh, Mike is so honest."

1009
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,071
"Mike is so motherfucking truthful!"

1010
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,891
You said in the interview your father
was a drunk like Carver.

1011
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,530
Is that true?

1012
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,762
- No. No.
- 'Cause my father was.

1013
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,004
My father was a mean fucking drunk.
You understand?

1014
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,242
He beat the shit out of us.

1015
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,283
But at least when he was beating us...

1016
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:14,206
he wasn't thinking
about taking us out to his toolshed.

1017
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,523
Because when he got us out there...

1018
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,524
that bastard would smile and say:

1019
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,240
"You want to get on your knees
and unbuckle my belt,"

1020
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,527
"or do I take it off
and use it on you?"

1021
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:27,103
After a while, I made myself numb, so....
But my--

1022
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,045
My little sister...

1023
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,729
Okay. Okay. Hey, hey, hey.

1024
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,210
Oh, God.

1025
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,885
Uh, I didn't know.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1026
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,363
That's fucking horrible, man.
I'm sorry.

1027
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:48,118
It's also not true.
See, I can pretend, too.

1028
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,565
Don't fuck with me, Mike.

1029
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,406
You're a little bit crazy.
You should start using that onstage.

1030
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,563
"Working with Riggan Thomson's"

1031
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,065
"like waltzing with a monkey?

1032
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,651
I might have said that.

1033
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,245
You might? Come on, let's go.

1034
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,164
- Come on.
- Yeah.

1035
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,641
Why don't you get your wings
and your bird suit?

1036
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:19,483
I'm gonna crab up on your ass
and fucking choke you out!

1037
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,603
Get off me.
What are you looking at?

1038
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,161
What are you going to do, replace me?!

1039
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,527
Get fucking Ryan Gosling or some shit?!

1040
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,161
What do you think my friend Tabitha
will do to you in the <i>Times,</i>

1041
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,544
you fucking dilettante!

1042

<i>You are lame, Riggan...</i>

1043
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,808
<i>rolling around
with that poncy theater fuck...</i>

1044
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,044
<i>in an 800-seat shithole like this.</i>

1045
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,485
<i>Oh, you really fucked up this time.</i>

1046
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,805
<i>You destroy a genius book
with that infantile adaptation.</i>

1047
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:18,125
<i>Now you're about to destroy
what's left of your career.</i>

1048
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,651
<i>It's pathetic.</i>

1049
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,405
Breathing in, I am calm.

1050
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,166
<i>Let's get the hell out of here
while we can.</i>

1051
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,642
I ignore this mental formation.

1052
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:28,801
This is a mental formation.

1053
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,809
<i>Stop that shit!</i>

1054
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:34,287
<i>I'm not a mental formation.
I'm you, asshole.</i>

1055
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:36,801
Leave me alone.

1056
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,087
<i>You were a movie star, remember?</i>

1057
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,482
- <i>Pretentious, but happy.</i>
- I wasn't happy.

1058
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,402
<i>Ignorant, but charming.
Now, you're just a tiny, bitter cocksucker.</i>

1059
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,842
I was fucking miserable.

1060
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:52,846
<i>Yeah, but fake miserable.
Hollywood miserable.</i>

1061
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,605
<i>What are you trying to prove?</i>

1062
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,682
<i>You're an artist? You're not.</i>

1063
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,331
Fuck you!

1064
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,006
<i>No, fuck you, you coward.</i>

1065
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:05,001
<i>We grossed billions!
You're ashamed of that? Billions!</i>

1066
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,362
And billions of flies
eat shit every day!

1067
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,363
So what? Does that make it good?

1068
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,045
I don't know if you noticed,
but that was 1992!

1069
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,364
<i>You could jump right back into that suit,
if you wanted to.</i>

1070
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:21,366
Oh, look at me! Look at this!
Look, look, look!

1071
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,041
I look like a turkey with leukemia!

1072
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,367
I'm fucking disappearing.

1073
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,045
This is what's left!

1074
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,691
I'm the answer to a fucking
<i>Trivial Pursuit</i> question!

<i>You're an imposter here.</i>

<i>Eventually they will figure you out.</i>

1077
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,684
What part of this don't you get?
You're dead.

1078
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,120
<i>We are not dead.</i>

1079
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,890
Oh, please, just stay dead.

1080
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,531
<i>We are not dead.</i>

1081
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:46,041
Stop saying "we!!"
There is no "we!"

1082
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:50,081
I'm not fucking you!
I'm Riggan fucking Thomson!

1083
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,405
<i>No, you're Birdman.</i>

1084
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,084
<i>Because without me,
all that's left is you...</i>

1085
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,244
<i>a sad, selfish, mediocre actor...</i>

1086
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:05,246
<i>grasping at the last vestiges

1087
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,321
<i>What the hell did you do that for?
I liked that poster.</i>

1088
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,445
<i>It's always "we," brother.</i>

1089
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:21,202
Fuck you! Shut the fuck up!

1090
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,771
Leave me alone!

1091
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:35,129
You're fucking, so fucking annoying!
Shut up!

1092
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:43,805
Hey. What's up?

1093
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:45,411
Well...

1094
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,806
one hour till curtain.
Why don't you rest a bit?

1095
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,291
Yeah, I'm going to lay down.

1096
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,280
- Almost there, buddy. Last preview.
- Okay. Cool.

1097
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,931
- How you doing?
- Good. Great.

1098
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:59,602
The money came through.
I just need to transfer it into the account.

1099
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,131
Good. That's terrific.

1100
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,642
So... I'll go, uh, do that.

1101
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,285
Thanks for stopping by.

1102
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,163
You know I'm proud of you, don't you?

1103
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,324
This took balls.

1104
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:18,007
- And you did it, okay?
- I know.

1105
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,166
I think we should cancel the preview.

1106
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,847
I'm tired, dude.
I can't do this anymore, Jake.

1107
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,171
I can't.

1108
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,444
That's a joke, right?

1109
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,220
You know, I don't think this is for me.
The whole...

1110
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,641
They're laughing at me.

1111
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:44,846
There is a three-block line of people
waiting for you.

1112
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,209
It's a full house. We're sold out!

1113
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,843
- Really?
- Yes!

1114
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,123
And the French ambassador's coming.

1115
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:57,204
The Prince of Saudi Arabia's
bringing one of his wives.

1116
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:01,206
And I didn't want to tell you this,
but Martin Scorsees...

1117
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,884
is casting his new film, and...
Don't tell anybody.

1118
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,202
- No, I won't.
- Okay?

1119
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,166
Okay?

1120
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,528
Okay. Yeah, yeah, I can be ready.
I can be ready.

1121
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,564
- Good.
- Thank you.

1122
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:19,811
How is he?

1123
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,286
He'll be fine.

1124
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,686
Poor creature.

1125
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,604
Is it true? Scorsese?

1126
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,684
Yeah. And the new Pope, too.

1127
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,202
You're an asshole, Jake!

1128
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,207
I'm the one keeping this afloat!

1129
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,645
Are you okay?

1130
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,086
Yeah. Yeah.

1131
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,611
I think I cut my hand shaving.

1132
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:03,569
Well, I just wanted to say...
I'm sorry.

1133
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,041
What for?

1134
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,049
I knew what Mike was capable of

1135
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,963
and I brought him in anyway.

1136
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,561
No, no, no. You did good.

1137
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,244
Are you kidding? You did great.

1138
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:19,726
Tomorrow's my first opening night on Broadway.

1139
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,105
Mine, too.

1140
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:26,086
And I just want to let you know that,
no matter what happens...

1141
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,924
I'm really grateful to you.

1142
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,003
Oh, no, no, no. Me, too.

1143
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,764
This is exciting.

1144
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,764
We have a full house.
Jake just told me.

1145
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,603
Yeah, it's great.

1146
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,209
Oh, God.

1147
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,006
For fuck's sake, just jump already.

1148
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,004
How'd you know I'd be up here?

1149
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:26,685
Well, I didn't know,
but I kind of hoped maybe.

1150
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,365
Where is Lesley?

1151
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,684
Lesley? Uh, Lesley's moving on.

1152
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,850
Smart girl.

1153
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,884
Oh, thank you. I appreciate that support.

1154
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,202
You ready for your last preview?

1155
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,081
Sure, yeah.

1156
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,691
Who did that to you?

1157
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,202
Could have been anybody, I guess.

1158
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:53,726
Yes.

1159
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,361
I'm sort of hoping it was Lesley.

1160
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,043
It wasn't Lesley.

1161
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:03,791
Oh, my God.

1162
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,362
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No.

1163
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,050
Jesus Christ!

1164
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,202
I think maybe I deserved it.

1165
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,571
Fuck.

1166
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,571
Fuck.

1167
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,564
Tell me something.

1168
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:26,402
What is the worst thing
that he did to you?

1169
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,561
Seriously.

1170
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,729
He was never around.

1171
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,767
Yeah? I mean, so what?
That was it?

1172
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:37,766
No. It was how he tried
to make up for it...

1173
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:41,965
by constantly trying to convince me
that I was special.

1174
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,083
Okay. Look.

1175
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,285
Look at me.

1176
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,090
He was right, though.

1177
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:58,727
About what?

1178
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,609
About your being special.

1179
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,601
You've been hanging around here...

1180
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,888
trying to make yourself invisible

1181
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,446
behind this fragile little fuck-up routine...

1182
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,125
but you can't.

1183
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,285
You're anything but invisible.
You're big.

1184
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,124
You're kind of a great mess.

1185
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,808
It's like a candle burning at both ends,
but it's beautiful.

1186
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:25,806
No amount of booze or weed or attitude
is going to hide that.

1187
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:36,123
I'm glad you're an actor and not a writer,
'cause that was, like...

1188
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:38,971
Oprah...

1189
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,651
Hallmark...

1190
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:43,891
R. Kelly bad.

1191
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,491
Yeah, well, I wasn't--

1192
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,161
Truth or dare?

1193
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:13,002
- Truth.
- No.

1194
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,682
- Truth.
- No.

1195
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,011
Truth or dare?

1196
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,727
Do you have any idea
where you're going?

1197
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,644
Absolutely not.

1198
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,564
How do you do it?

1199
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:02,891
Do what?

1200
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,565
Go out there every single night

1201
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,961
and pretend to be somebody else
in front of all those people?

1202
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,244
I don't pretend out there.
I told you.

1203
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:14,928
I pretend just about every place else,
but not out there.

1204
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,206
That's a shame.

1205
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,764
What are we doing here?

1206
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,091
What do you mean?

1207
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,401
I mean, what are we doing here?

1208
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:39,764
By the time we got to the hospital,
the kid was dead.

1209
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,926
So we took the old couple up to the O.R.

1210
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:47,124
We worked like hell on them...

1211
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,922
through most of the night.

1212
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:55,608
The husband, the old man,
was depressed for the longest time.

1213
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,601
Even after I told him the wife would pull through,
he was still depressed.

1214
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:04,602
So I went up to the mouth hole
and I asked him.

1215
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:10,445
And he told me it was because
he couldn't see her...

1216
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,280
the wife, through the eye holes.

1217
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,210
Can you imagine?

1218
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,806
I'm telling you,
this guy's heart was breaking...

1219
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:23,126
because he couldn't turn his goddamn head
to see his goddamn wife.

1220
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:24,801
So...

1221
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:29,325
I guess the question
we should ask ourselves is...

1222
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:33,801
what do we talk about
when we talk about love?

1223
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,684
Mel and I had been together five years...

1224
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:52,163
and I don't know how many times
I've heard "I love you,"

1225
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,401
but it wasn't until that night...

1226
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:54,966
The blood rig should be good now.

1227
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,168
Be ready to go in two minutes.

1228
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,330
That was amazing!

1229
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,090
Yeah, good, right?

1230
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,691
It's actually going well.

1231
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,206
Yeah.

1232
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,125
I think we need to talk.

1233
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,440
No, no.

1234
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,524
Yeah, I guess you're right...

1235
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,081
but we will eventually,
because that's the only way

1236
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:20,447
I'll get a chance to say I'm sorry.

1237
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,689
I really am sorry.

1238
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,364
We'd have made great parents.

1239
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,965
Horrible. We'd have been...

1240
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,280
Awful. We'd have raised...

1241
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,487
- a serial killer.
- Or Justin Bieber.

1242
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,568
I really wanted to be a mom.

1243
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,886
But my body doesn't seem to agree.

1244
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,484
When I imagined myself on Broadway,

1245
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,801
I never saw the dancing reindeer.

1246
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,405
Nice touch.

1247
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:59,562
In the days before Nick's depression
started to eat away at him...

1248
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,723
he had no idea I was pregnant...

1249
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,722
and I never intended to tell him.

1250
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,685
I guess we make choices in life,

1251
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,722
and we choose to live with them.

1252
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,371
Or not.

1253
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,924
I didn't want that baby.

1254
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:15,767
Not because I didn't love Nick,
and not because

1255
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,411
I didn't love the idea of it,
but because...

1256
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,251
I just wasn't ready to love myself.

1257
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,161
There's a distance to it all now.

1258
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:30,160
Hey, Jimmy, you got a smoke?

1259
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,323
Jimmy! Jimmy!

1260
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:30,641
Jimmy!

1261
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,171
Shit!

1262
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:40,841
Fuck!

1263
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,365
Fuck.

1264
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,603
Hey, aren't you Riggan Thomson?

1265
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,330
Holy shit, let me get an autograph.

1266
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,682
Don't be a dick.
Give me an autograph.

1267
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,441
Dude, you rock!

1268
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,045
Birdman!

1269
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:09,045
Oh, shit!

1270
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,522
Oh, my God!
You know who that is?

1271
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,042
Oh, can we take one picture!

1272
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,045
Just one picture!
Kids, get next to him!

1273
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,725
You suck!

1274
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,724
You suck!

1275
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,043
Hey, Birdman!

1276
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:40,404
Riggan, I'm missing him.

1277
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:43,724
It's the Bird-fucking-man!
Hey, come look at this guy!

1278
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:47,721
Birdman! Hey, Birdman, look at that!

1279
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,490
Where you going, man?

1280
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,922
You look so old in person.

1281
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:00,765
Fuck you!

1282
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:07,084
Sir! Sir! Where are you going?

1283
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:10,085
Sir! Where are you--? Sir!

1284
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:11,407
What are you doing?

1285
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:14,450
Waiting for Jake.
This is my attorney, Mr. Roth.

1286
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:17,604
We're pursuing financial remunerations
for the injuries--

1287
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,205
I got a play to do!

1288
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,124
Sir, you can't go in there!

1289
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,284
Actors Equity is a very strong union, sir!

1290
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:38,441
Knock, knock, knock!
Terri! Terri!

1291
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,961
Ed?

1292
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:43,211
What are you doing here?

1293
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,045
Why?! I just need you to tell me why?

1294
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:47,964
Take it easy, Ed.
I know this is hard.

1295
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:49,884
Shut up! Fuck you! Shut up!

1296
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,121
Shut up!

1297
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,970
Eddie, please!

1298
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,323
What's wrong with me?!

1299
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:03,486
Why do I always...
beg people to love me?

1300
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:07,646
Eddie, please, just...
just give me the gun.

1301
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,482
I just wanted to be what you wanted.

1302
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:15,168
Now I spend every fucking day...

1303
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,482
trying to be somebody I'm not!

1304
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,781
Put the gun down.
She doesn't love you!

1305
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:21,807
Eddie.

1306
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:25,009
Look at me. I was drowning.

1307
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,065
I'm just not capable of that kind of--

1308
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,844
You deserve to be loved, Eddie.
You do.

1309
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,162
I just wanted to be what you wanted.

1310
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:37,001
Mr. Roth? Okay, don't leave, please.

1311
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,169
Is that a threat? What wheelchair?

1312
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,364
Okay, Mr. Roth, please hear me out.
Will you?

1313
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,921
Don't hang up. Don't hang up.

1314
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,168
Give me 10 minutes to grab my things,

1315
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:49,846
give me 10 minutes and we can--
Don't hang up.

1316
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,840
Goddamn it!
The motherfucker hung up!

1317
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,241
Dad.

1318
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:46,571
Dad!

1319
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,686
Are you... okay?

1320
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:49,921
Why?

1321
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,922
You seem sort of...

1322
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,248
No, I'm good, I'm good.

1323
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,482
This is good. You want some?

1324
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:58,921
No.

1325
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:04,082
Do you really think
you'll be ready for opening tomorrow?

1326
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,771
Yeah. Yep.

1327
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,602
Yeah, well, I mean...

1328
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:12,407
previews were pretty much
a train wreck.

1329
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,767
We can't seem to get through a performance...

1330
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:19,764
without a raging fire
or a raging hard-on. I'm broke.

1331
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:22,964
I'm not sleeping, like, you know...
at all.

1332
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:27,968
And, uh, this play is kind
of starting to feel like...

1333
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:32,444
a miniature, deformed version of myself
that just keeps...

1334
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,802
following me around and, like...

1335
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:39,285
hitting me in the balls with, like,
a tiny little hammer.

1336
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:42,970
I'm sorry, what was the question?

1337
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:44,651
Never mind.

1338
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,844
Tonight wasn't bad.

1339
01:18:46,944 --> 01:18:48,447
I know.

1340
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:49,806
It was weird, but it was kind of cool.

1341
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,127
Yeah, really?

1342
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:52,645
Yeah, I think people liked it.

1343
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:56,007
What are you doing? Homework?

1344
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,651
No, I don't--

1345
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,004
No. When I was in rehab,
they made us do this.

1346
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,361
Really? What is it?

1347
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,440
These dashes represent the six billion years

1348
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:07,681
that the Earth has been around.

1349
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:11,169
So, each dash represents a thousand years.

1350
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:15,729
And, this...
is how long humans have been here.

1351
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,682
150,000 years.

1352
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,284
I think they're trying to remind us that

1353
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:24,006
that's all our ego
and self-obsession are worth.

1354
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,842
I was a shitty father, wasn't I?

1355
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,850
No, you were...

1356
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,850
You were fine.

1357
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,680
That's right, I was...
I was just fine.

1358
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,531
I can't...

1359
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:47,761
Dad?

1360
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:50,370
Oh, shoot. I'm sorry.

1361
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,728
You just wiped out the entire human race.

1362
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:57,200
There it goes. I'm sorry.

1363
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,251
You're becoming a trending topic.

1364
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:04,607
Really?

1365
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:09,568
I should probably tell you about this
before anybody else does.

1366
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:16,726
350,000 views in less than an hour.

1367
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,721
Fuck.

1368
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:25,084
Believe or not, this is power.

1369
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,569
<i>Hey, look, it's Riggan Thomson!</i>

1370
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,570
<i>Look at that!</i>

1371
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:36,810
<i>One million, three hundred thousand hits
in the last 2 hours.</i>

1372
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:38,923
<i>That's Birdman actor Riggan Thomson.</i>

1373
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,645
Give me another one.

1374
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:42,487
You got it.

1375
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:44,091
<i>That takes a lot of balls.</i>

1376
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,127
<i>Or not.</i>

1377
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,488
<i>What do you have to do
to get a job these days?</i>

1378
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,081
<i>Why must actors have to resort to this?</i>

1379
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,606
That's going over to Ms. Dickinson.

1380
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,763
Give me a minute.

1381
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:04,602
Hey, that's on me.
She's a friend of mine.

1382
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,770
Okay. No problem.

1383
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,281
Thank you.

1384
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:20,931
That was...

1385
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:24,244
twenty years before I put
on that goddamn outfit.

1386
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,010
I don't care.

1387
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,442
Okay. I was just...

1388
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:34,082
You know, before you come tomorrow night.

1389
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:35,930
It doesn't matter.

1390
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,602
I'm going to destroy your play.

1391
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:44,728
But you didn't even see it.

1392
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,290
You know, did I do something to offend you?

1393
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,204
Actually, you did.

1394
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,044
You occupied a theater which

1395
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:52,361
might have been used
on something worthwhile.

1396
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:58,284
Okay. But you don't even know
if it's any good or not.

1397
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:02,804
That's true. I haven't read a word of it,
or even seen a preview...

1398
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,531
but after the opening tomorrow,

1399
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:08,127
I'm going to turn in the worst review
anybody has ever read.

1400
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,962
And I'm going to close your play.

1401
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,324
Would you like to know why?

1402
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:17,805
Because I hate you,
and everyone you represent.

1403
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:21,961
Entitled, selfish, spoiled children.

1404
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,486
Blissfully untrained,
unversed and unprepared...

1405
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,802
to even attempt real art.

1406
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:33,006
Handing each other awards
for cartoons and pornography.

1407
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:36,005
Measuring your worth in weekends?

1408
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,164
Well, this is the theater.

1409
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,209
You don't get to come here and pretend

1410
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:42,009
you can write, direct and act...

1411
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,765
in your own propaganda piece

1412
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,081
without coming through me first.

1413
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,881
So break a leg.

1414
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:54,404
So what has to happen
in a person's life

1415
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,403
for them to become a critic, anyway?

1416
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:59,049
What are you writing, a review?

1417
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:01,084
Is it any good?

1418
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:04,722
Is it bad? Did you even see it?
Let me read it.

1419
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,763
I will call the police.

1420
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,604
No, you won't.
Let's read your fucking review.

1421
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:11,400
"Callow." Callow is a label.

1422
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:14,402
"Lackluster." That's just a label.

1423
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:17,491
"Marginalia"? Are you kidding me?

1424
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:19,562
It sounds like you need penicillin
to clear that up.

1425
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:23,402
That's a label, too. These are all labels.
You just label everything.

1426
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:28,084
That's so fucking lazy.
You're a lazy fucker.

1427
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:29,601
You're a lazy--

1428
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,924
Do you know what this is?
Do you even know what it is?

1429
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,924
You don't. You know why?

1430
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,691
Because you can't see this thing

1431
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,125
if you don't know how to label it.

1432
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:43,331
You mistake those noises in your head
for true knowledge.

1433
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,965
- Are you finished?
- No.

1434
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,124
There's nothing in here
about technique, about structure...

1435
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:51,642
about intention.
It's just a bunch of crappy opinions...

1436
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:54,964
backed up by even crappier comparisons.

1437
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,965
You write a couple paragraphs,
and you know what?

1438
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:01,289
None of this costs you fucking anything.

1439
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:04,964
You risk nothing.
Nothing, nothing, nothing!

1440
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,282
Well, I'm a fucking actor.

1441
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,121
This play cost me everything.

1442
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:18,123
So I'll tell you what.
You take this fucking...

1443
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,801
malicious, cowardly...

1444
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:25,484
shittily written review
and you shove it right the fuck up...

1445
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:29,486
your wrinkly... tight ass.

1446
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,926
You're no actor, you're a celebrity.

1447
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,490
Let's be clear on that.

1448
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:46,842
I'm going to kill your play.

1449
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,044
Tomorrow...

1450
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:24,724
and tomorrow...

1451
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,529
and tomorrow,

1452
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:31,725
Creeps in this...

1453
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:36,042
petty pace...

1454
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:39,042
from day to day...

1455
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,884
to the last... syllable...

1456
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:48,247
of recorded time.

1457
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:51,570
And...

1458
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:56,566
all of our yesterdays...

1459
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,084
have lighted...

1460
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,924
fools...

1461
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:07,084
A pint of whiskey, please.

1462
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,442
the way to dusty death.

1463
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:13,084
Out... out...

1464
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,204
$6.50, my friend.

1465
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:17,730
$6.50.

1466
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,605
Here... I don't know what that is,
just take it.

1467
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,761
But your--

1468
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:28,125
Life is but a walking shadow,

1469
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:31,604
A poor...

1470
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:33,611
player...

1471
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:39,448
that struts and frets his hour
upon the stage...

1472
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:41,963
and then is heard...

1473
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,610
no more!

1474
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,804
It is a tale...

1475
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:50,966
told by an idiot...

1476
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:55,124
full of sound and fury...

1477
01:26:56,120 --> 01:27:00,125
signifying nothing!

1478
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:06,120
Where you going, man?
Was that too much?

1479
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:08,642
I was just trying to give you a range.

1480
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:11,047
It's a little bit too much.
I can tell, because you--

1481
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,844
I just want to give you a range.

1482
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:16,482
That was a little too much.
It was a little too much.

1483
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:14,046
<i>God, you look like shit, brother.</i>

1484
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:18,047
<i>You get that mongoloid look
when you're hung over.</i>

1485
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:19,361
<i>Yeah.</i>

1486
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,201
<i>Let's go. Come on. Get up.</i>

1487
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:25,363
<i>It's a beautiful day.</i>

1488
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:30,250
<i>Forget about the</i> Times...
<i>everyone else has.</i>

1489
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,882
<i>Come on. Stand up!</i>

1490
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:37,210
<i>So you're not a great actor.
Who cares?</i>

1491
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:39,089
<i>You're much more than that.</i>

1492
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:43,086
<i>You tower over these other
theater douchebags.</i>

1493
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,084
<i>You're a movie star, man!</i>

1494
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:48,085
<i>You're a global force!
Don't you get it?</i>

1495
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,482
You spent your life building a bank account

1496
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,688
and a reputation--
and you blew 'em both.

1497
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,001
Good for you.

1498
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:56,607
Fuck it. We'll make a comeback.

1499
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:59,251
They're waiting for something huge.
Well, give it to them.

1500
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:03,002
Shave off that pathetic goatee.
Get some surgery!

1501
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:05,607
Sixty's the new thirty, motherfucker.

1502
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:09,686
You're the original.
You paved the way for these other clowns.

1503
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,524
Give the people what they want--

1504
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,443
old-fashioned apocalyptic porn.

1505
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:15,682
<i>Birdman: The Phoenix Rises.</i>

1506
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:18,127
Pimple-faced gamers creaming in their pants.

1507
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:21,204
A billion worldwide, guaranteed!

1508
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,044
You are larger than life, man.

1509
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:26,284
You save people from their boring,
miserable lives.

1510
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:29,444
You make them jump, laugh,
shit their pants.

1511
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:31,728
All you have to do is--

1512
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:44,203
That's what I'm talking about.

1513
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,965
Bones rattling! Big, loud, fast!

1514
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:51,488
Look at these people, at their eyes--
they're sparkling.

1515
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:55,002
They love this shit. They love blood.
They love action.

1516
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:59,962
Not this talky, depressing,
philosophical bullshit.

1517
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,005
<i>Yes.</i>

1518
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:12,005
<i>And the next time you screech...</i>

1519
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:17,007
<i>it'll explode into millions of eardrums.</i>

1520
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:21,690
<i>You'll glimmer on thousands of screens
around the globe.</i>

1521
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,321
<i>Another blockbuster.</i>

1522
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:27,527
<i>You are a god.</i>

1523
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,368
<i>See? There you go, you motherfucker.</i>

1524

<i>Gravity doesn't even apply to you.</i>

1525
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:38,006
<i>Wait till you see the faces
of those who thought we were finished.</i>

1526
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:40,447
<i>Listen to me.
Let's go back one more time</i>

1527
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:42,568
<i>and show them what we're capable of.</i>

1528

01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:56,371
<i>You hear me?</i>

1533
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:57,881
<i>You are--</i>

1534
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:59,530
Birdman!

1535
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:07,885
Hey! Is this for real,
or are you shooting a film?

1536
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:11,050
A film!

1537
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:13,840
You people are full of shit!

1538
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:17,562
Hey, man, can I help you?

1539
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:19,767
Be careful.

1540
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:22,566
Sorry, I can't talk. I'm late.

1541
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:24,571
Music.

1542
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,251
You okay, man?

1543
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:34,242
You want me to call somebody for you?

1544
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:37,765
Do you know where to go?

1545
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:42,807
Yeah.

1546
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,091
I know where to go.

1547
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:47,601
Hey!

1548
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:02,325
On!

1549
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:32,445
<i>You see?</i>

1550
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,841
<i>This is where you belong.</i>

1551
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,444
<i>Above them all.</i>

1552
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:44,891
Stop the music.

1553
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:46,491
I beg your pardon?

1554
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,702
Sir, you did not pay me!

1555
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:52,847
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

1556
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:56,004
This guy didn't pay me.
He's fucking crazy!

1557
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:31,846
Not a bad first act, huh?

1558
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:33,046
Not bad at all.

1559
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,486
It's going really well.

1560
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:36,882
I didn't think he could do Broadway.

1561
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:38,731
I never would have expected it.

1562
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,211
If the 2nd act is half as good...

1563
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,050
It's pretty glorious.

1564
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:44,248
What do we talk about
when we talk about Riggan Thomson?

1565
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,481
How long is the intermission?

1566
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:47,244
Birdman can act.

1567
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:09,401
I just came to say hello.

1568
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:12,889
It's going great out there.
You're so good.

1569
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:14,689
I mean it. I really mean it.

1570
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:17,924
<i>Places for the final scene, Riggan.</i>

1571
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:19,400
Do you need to...?

1572
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:21,084
No, it's fine.
Just sit here for a second.

1573
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,362
Look at all these roses.

1574
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:24,840
I hate roses.

1575
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:26,081
And you hate roses.

1576
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:30,287
Are you okay? You seem...

1577
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:34,288
I don't know, you seem abnormally calm.

1578
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:37,770
I am calm.

1579
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:40,603
I'm great, actually.

1580
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,321
You know...

1581
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:48,524
I got this little voice...
talks to me sometimes.

1582
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,644
Tells me the truth.

1583
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,291
It's comforting.

1584
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,802
Kind of scary, but it is comforting.

1585
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:57,248
I'm going to pretend
I didn't hear you say that.

1586
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:58,481
Okay.

1587
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,803
You wouldn't believe the crowd outside.

1588
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,804
They said some people
paid up to $500 a ticket.

1589
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,481
Really?

1590
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:07,681
Hey.

1591
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:11,163
Can I tell you something funny?

1592
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:14,723
Remember our last anniversary party?

1593
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,088
Seriously? You want to ruin a nice moment?

1594
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:18,491
Do you remember?

1595
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:20,927
You fucked Janet Rossbach in our bed.

1596
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,240
Skip over that part.

1597
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:23,481
Oh, gladly.

1598
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,968
You threw all the guests

1599
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,168
and you threw all the furniture
out the window.

1600
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,084
- I remember.
- Locked yourself in the bathroom.

1601
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,004
Why are we talking about...?

1602
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:33,605
I drove out to...

1603
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:35,411
Malibu.

1604
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:40,166
I just sat on the beach for a while,
looking out at the ocean.

1605
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:41,441
Riggan.

1606
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:43,330
And I walked...

1607
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:45,523
straight into the water.

1608
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:52,522
And then I tried to drown myself.

1609
01:36:57,680 --> 01:37:00,206
I was up to my chest
when I felt the first one.

1610
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,329
On my back, it was like somebody was

1611
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:05,210
holding a frying pan to me
and really burning.

1612
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:08,967
And then they were on my chest
and all over my legs.

1613
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:12,206
The water was full of jellyfish.

1614
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:15,921
They were all over me.

1615
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,766
I had to fight my way out of the water
and went up to the beach.

1616
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:23,607
I was rolling around
like a maniac in the sand...

1617
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:25,645
crying.

1618
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:29,288
You said it was a sunburn.

1619
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:33,444
I know. And you believed me.

1620
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:36,127
To be honest, I didn't give a shit.

1621
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:45,965
I love you.

1622
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:50,926
And I love Sam.

1623
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,126
I know.

1624
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:58,440
I really wish I hadn't videotaped her birth.

1625
01:37:58,800 --> 01:37:59,961
Why?

1626
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:01,281
'Cause...

1627
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,482
I missed the moment, really.

1628
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,211
I don't have it.

1629
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:08,647
I should have just been there
with the two of you.

1630
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:12,806
You know... just the three of us.

1631
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:17,491
But I wasn't.

1632
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:20,843
I wasn't even present in my own life,
and now I don't have it...

1633
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:22,810
and I'm never going to have it.

1634
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:24,605
You have Sam.

1635
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:26,170
Not really, I don't.
I mean, she's...

1636
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,323
No, she's just going through--

1637
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:30,529
No, I get it, I understand.

1638
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,329
She needed to have a dad...

1639
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:35,524
and instead she got this guy
who was a...

1640
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:38,650
three-day viral sensation.

1641
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,006
It is so pathetic, I can't...

1642
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,202
There are things more pathetic than that.

1643
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:43,601
Yeah, like?

1644
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:44,811
That moustache.

1645
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:52,328
<i>Riggan, we are in the motel.</i>

1646
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:55,370
<i>Last scene has started.
You're not here.</i>

1647
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:57,682
<i>Last chance for "places."</i>

1648
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:00,208
You better get back to your seat.

1649
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:25,208
Twenty little leopards
laughed at two lofty lions.

1650
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:28,564
Twenty little leopards
laughed at two lofty lions.

1651
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:32,725
Twenty little leopards
laughed at two lofty lions.

1652
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:06,442
Break a leg, Mr. Thomson.

1653
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:37,764
Let me put the blood rig on.

1654
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:45,011
Riggan!

1655
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:55,841
Terri!

1656
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:57,521
Terri!

1657
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:00,011
Eddie! What are you doing here?

1658
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:03,204
Why? I just want you to tell me why.

1659
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:05,522
- Shut up!
- Eddie, please!

1660
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:08,124
What's the matter with me?

1661
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:12,046
Tell me. Why do I always
have to beg people to love me?

1662
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:14,044
Eddie, please, give me the gun.

1663
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:17,204
It was me. I was drowning.
I'm just not capable of--

1664
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:20,888
You deserve to be loved, Eddie. You do.

1665
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:26,206
I just wanted to be what you wanted.
What you wanted.

1666
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:28,602
Now I spend every fucking minute trying

1667
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:30,808
to be something else,
something I'm not.

1668
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:32,724
Just put the gun down, Ed.

1669
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,404
She doesn't love you anymore.

1670
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,564
You don't, do you?

1671
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:40,041
No.

1672
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:41,246
And you never will.

1673
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:43,405
I'm sorry.

1674
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:56,251
I don't exist.

1675
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,570
I'm not even here.

1676
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:04,410
I'm not even here.

1677
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:06,241
Bang!

1678
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:19,601
Bang!

1679
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:14,885
Is he up?

1680
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:16,730
He just woke up.

1681
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:24,209
I thought I lost you, buddy.

1682
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:27,167
What the hell happened?

1683
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:31,404
I was watching you onstage
and all of a sudden...

1684
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:34,483
you had that goofy look in your eye
and you just...

1685
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:36,725
What is wrong with you?
He tried to--

1686
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:41,204
I'm happy! He's alive!
My best friend is alive! And...

1687
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:43,883
he's the fucking man of the hour.

1688
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:45,241
What is that?

1689
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:46,401
You have to be shitting me.

1690
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:47,921
Read it.

1691
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:51,249
I don't believe this.
"The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"?

1692
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:52,521
Read it.

1693
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:54,251
"By Tabitha Dickinson."

1694
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:55,606
Read it out loud!

1695
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:58,402
"Thomson has unwittingly given birth"

1696
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:01,091
"to a new form,
which can only be described as..."

1697
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,089
"super-realism."

1698
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:06,085
"Blood was spilled
both literally and metaphorically"

1699
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:07,730
"by artist and audience alike."

1700
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:09,285
"Real blood."

1701
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:11,369
"The blood that has been sorely missing"

1702
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:14,046
"from the veins of American theater..."

1703
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,442
You're happy about this?

1704
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:19,728
Happy? I'm fucking euphoric!

1705
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:22,451
This is the kind of review
that turns people into living legends!

1706
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:24,404
He shot the nose off his face!

1707
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:26,409
He got a new nose!

1708
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:28,960
And if doesn't like that one,
we'll get him a new one!

1709
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:31,442
We'll use Meg Ryan's guy.
Who cares?

1710
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:33,927
They're lighting candles for him
in Central Park.

1711
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,365
Turn on the TV.

1712
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:38,361
<i>--a vigil for actor Riggan Thomson.</i>

1713
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:42,122
They're praying for him all over the country.
He did it. You did it!

1714
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:46,283
I've been reborn, brother.
And I can see the future.

1715
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:48,688
This play is going to last forever.

1716
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:50,728
It's going to open in London, Paris.

1717
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:52,371
The studio will call,

1718
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:53,726
we're going to get book deals--
you'll see.

1719
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:55,405
So you can see the future?

1720
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:56,811
Yeah, I can!

1721
01:45:57,640 --> 01:46:00,603
How about that, huh?
Did you see that coming?

1722
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,650
Why aren't you saying anything?

1723
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:06,483
This is what you wanted, wasn't it?

1724
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,843
Riggan, this is what you wanted.

1725
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,161
Yeah.

1726
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:14,322
Yeah, this is what I wanted.

1727
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:16,528
Okay, listen.
You're going to get hit

1728
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:19,484
with a "brandishing a weapon" charge.

1729
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:22,240
If anybody talks to you about it,
it was an accident.

1730
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:24,170
Is that what this was?

1731
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:27,162
- An accident?
- An accident.

1732
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:28,921
Did you intend to shoot yourself!

1733
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:33,370
You motherfuckers, this is a hospital!
Get the fuck out of here!

1734
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:35,042
This is a hospital!

1735
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:39,011
Get the fuck out, you assholes!

1736
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:42,250
Out! This is a personal matter!

1737
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:43,685
A personal matter!

1738
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:48,521
Hey, Sam!
What did you feel like

1739
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:50,921
the night your father
tried to kill himself?

1740
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:19,245
Lilacs.

1741
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:29,404
Are you laughing?

1742
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:31,085
What's so funny?

1743
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:34,404
I can't smell them.

1744
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:42,285
What are you doing?

1745
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:43,771
Posting a photo of you
on your Twitter page.

1746
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,240
I have a Twitter page?

1747
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:47,084
Yeah, I set it up today.

1748
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:49,045
- Let me see.
- No way.

1749
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:50,451
You look hideous.

1750
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:52,808
Oh, thank you. I appreciate it.

1751
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:54,166
I'm just kidding.

1752
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:56,920
No, I'm actually not.
You do look hideous.

1753
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:01,443
You got 80,000 followers
in less than a day.

1754
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:02,921
Really?

1755
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,126
I'm going to scare the shit out of them.

1756
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:05,521
Let me look at it.

1757
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:06,601
It's done.

1758
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:13,611
Uh, I'm going to get a vase
for the flowers.

1759
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:17,087
Bye-bye... and fuck you.

1760
01:51:45,320 --> 01:51:46,321
Dad?

1761
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:49,481
Dad?

1762
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:52,241
Dad?
