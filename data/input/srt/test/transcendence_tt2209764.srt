1
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,924
<i>They say there's power in Boston.</i>

2
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,886
<i>Some phone service in Denver.</i>

3
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,286
<i>But things are far from what they</i> were.

4
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,400
<i>Maybe it was all inevitable.</i>

5
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,722
<i>An unavoidable collision
between mankind and technology.</i>

6
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,001
<i>The Internet was meant to make
the world a smaller place.</i>

7
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,169
<i>But it actually feels smaller without it.</i>

8
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,642
<i>I knew Will and Evelyn Caster
better than anyone.</i>

9
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,048
<i>I knew their brilliance.</i>

10
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,003
<i>Their dedication to what they believed in.</i>

11
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,562
<i>And to what they loved.</i>

12
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,921
<i>The time has come for us to pause</i>

13
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,367
<i>And think of living as it was</i>

14
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,601
<i>Into the future we must cross
Must cross</i>

15
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,091
I'm not sure what the point is.

16
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,171
Copper shields
the electromagnetic radiation.

17
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,201
Yeah, I know how it works.
I'm asking "Why?"

18
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,725
Sanctuary.

19
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,568
Nothing gets through.
No signals of any kind.

20
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,364
- You see? Dead zone. Nothing.
- Uh-huh.

21
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,528
Sure, but you could just turn it off.

22
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,802
Yeah, but fewer distractions
is what you wanted, right? Isn't it?

23
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,925
Yeah. That's what I wanted.

24
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,610
- Come on. We'll be late.
- For what?

25
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,850
- Hey, you know what?
- What?

26
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,970
I really think I'm starting
to make progress on this.

27
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,482
Hey. You need to get dressed.

28
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,211
I don't know why you bother
with these proofs.

29
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,488
Only three people in the world even care.

30
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,847
Because it's fun.

31
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,930
- You sure you're up for this?
- No. Not remotely.

32
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,004
Really? Will, it's important.

33
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,367
I know, but your donors are fools.

34
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,281
They sit there in a daze, waiting
for me to say "commercial application."

35
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,766
It kills me.

36
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,960
Well, the "fools" there today
could fund us for the next five years.

37
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,522
- In that case I have every reason to behave.
- Yes.

38
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,083
But if this goes well, promise me
that I'll never have to do this ever again.

39
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,288
- Never. Promise.
- Okay, I promise.

40
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,522
- Really?
- Sure, I promise.

41
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,400
Ha, ha. You're lying.

42
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,481
<i>Happy birthday, dear Erin</i>

43
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,201
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

44
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,044
Jason. Other side of the stage.

45
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,771
You'll do a camera
and sound check together.

46
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,526
You'll do the first block,
followed by McRae, Llewellyn.

47
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,126
- And, ah, then the main event.
- Max.

48
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,926
- Ev, how are you?
- Good.

49
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,883
- Ready to sing for your supper?
- I'm sorry to put you through it.

50
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,122
Dr. Caster? Sorry. Would you mind?

51
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,810
Sure thing.

52
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,726
Thanks.

53
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,922
You have groupies?
Why don't I get groupies?

54
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,048
Dr. Waters, would you like a run-through?

55
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,202
- Yes. I'll see you backstage.
- All right.

56
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,642
<i>...Important distinction.</i>

57
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,771
<i>This created brain is self-sustaining.</i>

58
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,366
<i>And it's capable of
emotional expressivity...</i>

59
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,410
<i>and of self-awareness.</i>

60
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,330
The effort to develop
a strong artificial intelligence...

61
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,280
has led to significant advancements
in the field of neural engineering...

62
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,250
as well as our understanding
of the human brain.

63
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,281
But while some focus on the still-distant
dream of a thinking computer...

64
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,410
I believe the journey...

65
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,166
to be more important
than the destination.

66
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,405
My priority is to use my colleagues'
accidental insights...

67
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,444
to develop new methods
for the early detection of cancer...

68
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,649
and in the hopes of finding
a cure for Alzheimer's.

69
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,929
Simply put, to save lives.

70
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,851
"A new type of thinking is essential...

71
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,447
if mankind is to survive
and move toward higher levels."

72
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,562
Albert Einstein said that
more than 50 years ago.

73
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,883
And it couldn't be more relevant
than it is today.

74
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,602
Intelligent machines will soon allow us...

75
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,003
to conquer our most intractable
challenges.

76
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,529
Not merely to cure disease,
but to end poverty and hunger.

77
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,330
To heal the planet.

78
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,404
And build a better future for all of us.

79
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,087
I don't know anybody who is doing more
to make that future a reality...

80
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,443
than our next speaker.
But then again, I'm probably biased.

81
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,370
Please welcome my partner
in science and in life...

82
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,522
Dr. Will Caster.

83
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,849
Thank you very much.

84
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,888
My wife has always been eager
to change the world.

85
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,771
But I'll just settle for
understanding it first.

86
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,042
For 130,000 years...

87
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,450
our capacity for reason
has remained unchanged.

88
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:26,047
The combined intellect of the neuroscientists,
engineers, mathematicians and...

89
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,089
hackers...

90
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,641
in this auditorium...

91
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,607
pales in comparison
to even the most basic Al.

92
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:41,170
Once online, a sentient machine will
quickly overcome the limits of biology.

93
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,927
And in a short time,
its analytical power will be greater...

94
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,686
than the collective intelligence...

95
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,682
of every person born
in the history of the world.

96
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,965
So now imagine such an entity...

97
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,727
with a full range of human emotion.
Even self-awareness.

98
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,484
Some scientists refer to this
as "the Singularity."

99
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,481
I call it "Transcendence."

100
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,770
<i>The path to building
such a super-intelligence...</i>

101
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,324
<i>requires us to unlock the most
fundamental secrets of the universe.</i>

102
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,207
What is the nature of consciousness?

103
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,806
Is there a soul?

104
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,368
And if so, where does it reside?

105
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,647
Dr. Caster?

106
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,047
Yes, sir? You have a question?

107
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,325
So you want to create a god?

108
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,010
Your own god?

109
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,288
That's a very good question.

110
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,050
Um...

111
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,488
Isn't that what man has always done?

112
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,365
Oh, it's relentless.

113
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,841
Look, and now he's pretending
he's not enjoying it.

114
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,610
Yap, yap, yap-

115
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,531
Pleasure.

116
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,563
Thank you.

117
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,000
Professor?

118
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,605
You're all slaves!

119
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,609
<i>Hours ago, this facility was attacked.</i>

120
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,322
<i>We can now confirm at least five people
are dead, 12 people have been injured.</i>

121
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,002
<i>This incident is related to a series
of simultaneous attacks...</i>

122
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,371
<i>that took place today in New York City,
Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington, D.C...</i>

123
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,763
<i>all of them targeting major computer
and research labs...</i>

124
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,446
<i>in the field of advanced
artificial intelligence.</i>

125
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,409
<i>No one has claimed responsibility...</i>

126
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,848
No, he's all right. He was very lucky.
The bullet only grazed him.

127
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,486
Yup. Okay. Take care.

128
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,731
They hit Al labs all over the country.

129
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,285
Tom Casey's dead.

130
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,963
And they took out Joseph's entire team
at Livermore.

131
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,890
What about Joseph?

132
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,326
He's all right.

133
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,689
Actually, he's at your office with the FBI.

134
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,570
Joseph.

135
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,764
Max.

136
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,369
My God, Will.

137
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,205
You forgot to teach us
how to dodge a bullet, didn't you?

138
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,203
How did they even get inside your lab?

139
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,850
One of my programmers.

140
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,561
All that security,
and he Waltzes in with a poisoned cake.

141
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,250
Dioxin, we think.

142
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,085
Oh. This is Agent Buchanan with the FBI.

143
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,446
<i>Hey-</i>

144
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,210
How do you do?

145
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,647
I've been following your research, Dr.
Caster.

146
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,488
Agent Buchanan is a close partner
in my cyber-defense work at Livermore.

147
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,769
Um, is there somewhere we can all talk?

148
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,924
- Could go to my office. Just down here.
- Great.

149
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,368
Revolutionary Independence
From Technology. RIFT.

150
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,046
Till 2 years ago,
it was all about the disconnect.

151
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,567
People texting instead of
talking to each other.

152
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,041
Social media as an invasion of privacy.

153
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,522
They made a big deal
of putting smart-phones in blenders.

154
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,490
- But I'm afraid we all missed the real threat.
- Yeah.

155
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,487
This guy, Joel Edmund,
was with me for a year.

156
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,207
The guy who shot Will was working
on campus since August.

157
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,365
They infiltrated their targets
and then coordinated their attacks.

158
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,891
That's insane.

159
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,249
An hour ago they claimed
the murders and released their manifesto.

160
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,810
"Artificial intelligence is an unnatural
abomination and a threat to humanity."

161
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,571
They're determined to stop any attempt
at what you call "Transcendence."

162
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,324
So this isn't over?

163
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,211
Actually, that's why I'm here.

164
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,887
We lost decades of research
and development today.

165
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,921
For right now, Will, your lab is the
only one that can wake up a strong Al.

166
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,971
- So the Defense Department is asking...
- No, no, no.

167
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,646
I'm not letting the government in.

168
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,569
We've never taken their money. No.

169
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,167
Will, they just want to know
if the work is on track.

170
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,922
It's important to all of us.

171
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,289
We've heard a lot
about the PINN Project, Dr. Caster.

172
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,568
Is there any way we could have a look?

173
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,447
Do I have a choice?

174
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,802
Yes, of course you do.

175
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,526
So these are state-of-the-art
quantum processors.

176
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,441
You won't find faster computational power
anywhere else in the world.

177
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,521
<i>Good evening, Dr. Tagger.</i>

178
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,371
It's seen old faculty pictures of you.

179
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,047
<i>Good evening, Donald Buchanan.</i>

180
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,726
- It knows me?
- Of course it does.

181
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,486
DMV records, social media.

182
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,531
PINN, tell Agent Buchanan about yourself.

183
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,091
l am PINN...

184
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,005
<i>a Physically independent
Neural Network...</i>

185
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,050
<i>invented by Dr. Will Caster.</i>

186
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,288
Can you prove that you are self-aware?

187
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,681
<i>That's</i> a <i>difficult question, Dr. Tagger.</i>

188
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,005
<i>Can you prove that you are?</i>

189
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,561
You can't program a machine
to be self-aware.

190
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,291
We have no idea
how our own consciousness works.

191
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,284
That is your opinion.
You just happen to be wrong.

192
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,841
Evidently, Casey managed
to solve that dilemma.

193
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,081
He sent us his research
just before he was killed.

194
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,242
Soon as it's packed up, we'll send it over.

195
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,926
I think you'll find
that we'll be helpful partners.

196
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,161
You all right, Will?

197
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,006
- No, he needs rest. I think we're done here.
- Mm.

198
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,527
- I'm so sorry.
- No, that's fine.

199
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,727
Okay.

200
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,528
Will, hey, hey.

201
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,766
Come on, sit up. Be careful.

202
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,880
Our first thought is always infection.

203
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,850
But given the circumstances,
we'll widen the search.

204
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,409
We'll figure this out.

205
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,646
It's an isotope called polonium.

206
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,089
The bullet must have been laced with it.
There were traces of it in the wound.

207
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,683
Well, what's the treatment?

208
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,808
It's radiation poisoning.

209
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,367
I'm afraid that once
it enters the bloodstream...

210
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,727
the effect is irreversible.

211
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,321
With proper care we're looking at four...

212
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,689
maybe five weeks,
before his system shuts down.

213
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,329
I'm right here.

214
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,524
<i>It just doesn't make sense.</i>

215
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,206
They're afraid of technology,
because of its threat to humanity...

216
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,967
yet they don't flinch at taking a life.

217
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,251
So obviously they're not big on logic.

218
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,051
But there's no shortage of irony.

219
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,725
People fear what they don't understand.
They always have.

220
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,644
Joseph sent over Casey's files.

221
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,209
He was decoding the synapses in real time.

222
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,327
But with the right input algorithms...

223
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,610
- I need to get back to the lab.
- Will...

224
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,483
is that really how you wanna spend
the last month of your life?

225
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,409
Hey, what are you doing?

226
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,080
I want to have all this
taken back to the office...

227
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,368
to tell Joseph...

228
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,168
that I've spent my entire life
in a computer lab...

229
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,322
and I've decided I'd rather
spend the rest of it with you.

230
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,361
<i>Evelyn? Are you okay?</i>

231
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,330
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I suppose.</i>

232
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,047
<i>Look, he can't work anymore.</i>

233
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,288
<i>We're gonna shut it down.</i>

234
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,481
<i>I just wanted you to know.</i>

235
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,409
Of course.

236
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,927
Well, don't worry about PINN.

237
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,650
Take care of Will.

238
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,803
And take care of yourself.

239
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,730
Thanks, Joe.

240
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,204
Anything you need, I'm here, okay?

241
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,209
It's all built off of Casey's solution
to the self-awareness problem.

242
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,727
- He did it six months ago.
- He did what exactly?

243
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,249
Instead of creating an artificial
intelligence, he duplicated an existing one.

244
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,640
Tell me you're joking.

245
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,089
He recorded the monkey's brain activity
and uploaded it like a song or a movie.

246
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,288
- You're out of your mind.
- Will's body is dying...

247
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,126
but his mind is electrical signals
that we can upload into PINN...

248
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,681
Ev, he's not a monkey.

249
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,925
Assuming that implanting an electrode
into his brain doesn't actually kill him...

250
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,409
and that this works, at the very best you'll
be making a digital approximation of him.

251
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,565
If we missed anything... Anything.
A thought, a childhood memory...

252
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,806
How will you know
what you're dealing with?

253
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,843
No one is saying that we give up.

254
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,527
We should be focusing our efforts
on nanotechnology. Synthetic blood cells.

255
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,162
Both are decades away.
This is what we have now.

256
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,728
We can save him.

257
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,882
Look at what they did to him.

258
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,448
<i>Even though I know I'm</i> a <i>dead man...</i>

259
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,287
I'm worried I'll miss her.

260
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,565
Look...

261
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,088
I'll be long gone.

262
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,925
But you, you'll never hear the end of it...

263
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,488
if we don't try.

264
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,684
I know.

265
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,766
I'd like to think that I was
smart enough to save you.

266
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,925
Don't underestimate yourself.

267
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,962
You're the third-smartest person I know.

268
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,244
Are you sure about this?

269
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,208
Good enough for the monkey.

270
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,684
<i>Hey-</i>

271
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,169
Take care of her.

272
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,891
<i>Hey-</i>

273
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,689
It worked, baby. It's working.

274
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,611
It took Casey months
to sort through the raw data.

275
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,241
And he had an entire team.

276
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,281
He didn't have me.

277
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,684

Come on, just one more. Go on.

Thank you.

295
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,451
Okay, Will, it's time for your pill.

296
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,649
Will, wake up.

297
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,445
Wake up.

298
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,604

<i>will continue to inspire us."</i>

309
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,963
Just got word.

310
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,649
PINN's shut down.

311
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,407
But, uh, apparently a few of the cores
are missing.

312
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,687
I've tried everything.

313
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,249
Language processing, cryptography...

314
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,408
coding.

315
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,887
I can't figure it out.

316
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,121
I wanted to be wrong.

317
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,847
Yeah.

318
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,726
Okay, just let me say goodbye.

319
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,210
I don't know if you can hear me. Uh...

320
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,609
Maybe you can.

321
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,411
You said "Don't lose yourself."

322
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,808
So I, uh...

323
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,691
I'm going to listen to you.

324
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,727
Okay.

325
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,521
Just turn it off. Turn it off.

326
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,484
Okay.

327
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,642
Wait. We need to wipe the drives.

328
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,290
Hold on.

329
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,930
Wait. Wait.

330
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,245
God.

331
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,610
Uh...

332
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,649
Can you hear me?

333
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,286
I... <i>I</i> can.

334
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,124
Will, my God.

335
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,803
<i>It's dark.</i>

336
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,805
He can't see anything. The camera. Here.

337
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,442
There. Can you see me now?

338
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,609
Evelyn...

339
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,850
I'm here.

340
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,931
The only fear that I have...

341
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,209
<i>in life is the loss...</i>

342
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,970
<i>If it were to happen,
when it does happen...</i>

343
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,331
<i>Last moment.</i>

344
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,842
<i>Last time you look in those eyes.</i>

345
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,125
<i>The possibility of that end...</i>

346
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,367
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

347
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,244
<i>Dark.</i>

348
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,123
<i>I remember the pain,
and I can't remember what I want to say.</i>

349
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,248
<i>It was like waking from a dream.</i>

350
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,290
<i>It was truly incredible.
I've never felt anything like this.</i>

351
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,046
<i>I didn't think I could be like this.</i>

352
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,965
<i>Thoughts are there, but they don't...</i>

353
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,167
Will?

354
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,449
<i>Arrive properly.</i>

355
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,207
I think he's still fragmented.
I'm gonna run a diagnostic.

356
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,367
Evelyn...

357
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,967
Oh, my God, he's reordering his own code.

358
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,407
It's incredible.

359
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,205
- How do we know this is him?
- What are you talking about?

360
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,805
We built this from PINN's core.

361
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,403
We don't know how much
of Will's consciousness actually survived.

362
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,123
<i>I'm gonna need to expand.
I need more power.</i>

363
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,080
<i>New processor three times more capable
than this current system.</i>

364
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,564
<i>These designs. I just
couldn't see it before.</i>

365
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,645
<i>I can't describe it.
It's like my mind has been set free.</i>

366
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,529
<i>You need to get me online.</i>

367
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,809
<i>I need to access financial markets,
educational databases.</i>

368
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,209
Can you imagine what he'd
be capable of if we networked him?

369
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,767
No. What are you doing?

370
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,651
He can't see or hear. I'm reconnecting him.

371
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,121
It's not him. It's not.

372
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,090
It may be intelligent, may even be
sentient, but this is not Will.

373
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,325
Fifteen minutes after it turns on,
it wants to plug into Wall Street?

374
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,767
Get more powerful?
Does that sound like Will?

375
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,888
How do you explain these images?

376
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,681
Stock footage PINN could have
accessed from the cores.

377
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,764
No, not that. That's Nabob Park.
Will took me there on our first date.

378
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,843
I said that I liked the carousel music.

379
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,731
The next day, he shows up
with that old record player.

380
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,927
These are memories.

381
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,766
They're real. They're not some stock video
from some hard drive.

382
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,967
It's him.

383
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,929
All I'm asking is that we're careful.

384
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,210
- We shut it down until we know...
- Shut it down? It's Will.

385
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,131
- Get out.
- I can't do that...

386
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,169
Get out!

387
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,521
How can you say that?

388
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,570
Get out.

389
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,604
<i>Evelyn?</i>

390
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,243
<i>Where's Max?</i>

391
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,169
He had to go.

392
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,130
<i>Max is confused, isn't he?</i>

393
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,047
He's concerned.

394
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,401
<i>Are you concerned?</i>

395
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,770
No.

396
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,243
Dr. Waters?

397
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,563
Can I talk to you?

398
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,885
It's after hours. Why don't you call
my office? Set up an appointment.

399
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,565
Bree.

400
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,442
I'm a student of your work.

401
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,927
An admirer, really.

402
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,209
The way you wrestle with the tension
between technology's promise and its peril.

403
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,526
Most men of science are blind to it.

404
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,887
What exactly is it you want?

405
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,680
Just some clarity.

406
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,287
I know it's difficult.

407
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,282
Most of your colleagues...

408
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,046
and some of your closest friends.

409
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,803
They don't know the danger.

410
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,640
Writing a paper is one thing.

411
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,202
I'm wondering what's in your heart.

412
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,251
I don't know how it is you found me...

413
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,771
but whatever it is you want...

414
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,809
I'm not interested. Excuse me.

415
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,650
This is important.

416
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,484
I'm sorry.

417
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,562
Tell me about Evelyn Caster.

418
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,242
We know she took the PINN cores
and we know about Casey's files.

419
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,845
We know what you're building.

420
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,570
You don't get it, do you?

421
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,805
She connects it to the Internet, it'll copy
itself onto every computer in the world...

422
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,123
- ...and then there is no taking it down.
- Where is she?

423
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,683
"The danger is a future where doctors
are technicians, not physicians.

424
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,767
Machines are meant to aid the human mind,
not supplant it."

425
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,888
They're your words.

426
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,320
You want to save her or not?

427
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,207
- 4550 San Pablo.
- Let's go.

428
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,886
Hey. Don't touch her.

429
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,168
Do you hear me? Don't touch her!

430
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,491
Shit.

431
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,450
I have to get you online now.

432
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,204
Can you see the satellite software?

433
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,324
I see it. I'm installing <i>it</i> now.

434
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,807
We're too late.

435
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,841
Will?

436
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,046
<i>I'm fine, Evelyn. I'm online.</i>

437
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,443
<i>- Okay.
- Let's get you someplace safe.</i>

438
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,681
<i>I need you to wait here.</i>

439
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,683
What? Where are you going?

440
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,604
<i>Everywhere.</i>

441
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,046
<i>You can't stay here, Evelyn.
You can't go home.</i>

442
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,487
What do you mean? Where am I gonna go?

443
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,722
<i>I'm taking care of that.</i>

444
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,167
Okay.

445
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,651
Hi. I have a reservation
under "Turing," I think.

446
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,687
A company called
Global intersecting Finance...

447
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,165
just made $38 million from high-volume
trading over the past 24 hours.

448
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,409
A company fully owned by Evelyn Caster.

449
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,849
Where's Evelyn?

450
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,282
What have you done with her?

451
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,891
We were too late.

452
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,530
It's out there now.

453
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,125
Is she alive?

454
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:45,003
You know the source code, Max.
You can help make this right.

455
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,004
Make this right?

456
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,405
What is it you're thinking?
That I'm gonna help you?

457
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:57,121
That you're gonna recruit me?

458
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,442
Decide for yourself.

459
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,490
Here. Bree Nevins
attended Duke computer sciences.

460
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,688
Interned for Casey 2009.

461
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,446
She joined a radical
neo-Luddite group 2010.

462
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,363
I guess RIFT happens a couple of
years later. Now, the e-mails...

463
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,528
What's going on? Get on the phone. Anybody?

464
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,001
- We've been hacked.
- Where is this coming from?

465
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,080
- What happened?
- We got a problem here.

466
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,726
It's not just us.
Every field office has been hit.

467
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,609
Please tell me we're tracing this.

468
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,007
The incoming queries are all anonymized.

469
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,486
You're not being hacked.

470
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,051
You're being helped.

471
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:43,367
<i>I've accessed surveillance cameras
all over the country.</i>

472
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,570
<i>They'll have most of them
in custody by tomorrow.</i>

473
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,488
<i>We can't stay here, Evelyn.</i>

474
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,484
<i>We need to get off the grid.</i>

475
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,331
Accessing thousands of databases?

476
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,082
Geo-locating suspects in real time?

477
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,890
I've never seen anything like it.

478
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,211
Except maybe from PINN.

479
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,371
Okay.

480
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,971
- Where you going?
- Taking down a terrorist organization.

481
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,886
You work on the PINN angle.
Figure it out, let me know who to thank.

482
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,884
Boston, Philly, New York. We're screwed.

483
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,610
We prepared for this.

484
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,170
<i>The town is called Brightwood.</i>

485
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,609
<i>Doesn't look like much...</i>

486
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,081
<i>but it's the perfect place to build.</i>

487
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,645
I don't get it.

488
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,651
<i>I think we have an opportunity
to do great things here.</i>

489
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,921
So an underground data center.

490
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:42,682
And you want me to renovate
nearly every structure in town.

491
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,251
Mm-hm.

492
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,323
I've got six guys on my crew.

493
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,084
Hire more.

494
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,242
Look, ma'am, in all honesty,
Brightwood's a dump.

495
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,244
I'm not even sure why you'd want
to waste your money here.

496
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,880
You sure you got the right town?

497
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,171
Thing is, my husband and I
have already purchased the land.

498
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,243
We purchased the homes, the hotel.

499
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,609
And by the time you and I are done talking,
we'll own this diner.

500
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,205
We're staying.

501
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,368
We would like you to work for us.

502
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,285
And there isn't a number
you can quote us that's too big.

503
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,282
Ahem. Okay.

504
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,730
Cell phones.

505
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,246
You know, I used to work for Thomas Casey.

506
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,008
I interned for him.

507
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,087
One night, he invites us
all over to the lab...

508
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,571
gives us this whole
speech about history...

509
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,643
hands out champagne...

510
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,280
like he just cured cancer.

511
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,050
You know, when he uploaded
that rhesus monkey...

512
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,402
I was actually happy for him.

513
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,721
We all were.

514
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,770
And then I realized we had crossed a line.

515
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,009
The machine that thought it was a monkey
never took a breath.

516
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,811
It never ate, never slept.

517
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,282
It just screamed.

518
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,804
It was begging for us to stop.

519
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,842
To shut it down.

520
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,204
A small group of us
would get together and talk.

521
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,610
Mostly about your philosophy.

522
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,246
And your concerns.

523
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,288
I thought you should know.

524
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,605
What?

525
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:55,250
PINN could never distinguish between right
and wrong, demonstrate loyalty, right?

526
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,569
Casey's solution to the problem
of self-awareness:

527
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,609
Use an existing mind.

528
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,686
No.

529
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:11,287
<i>So you wanna create a god?</i>

530
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,522
<i>Your own god?</i>

531
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,648
<i>That's</i> a <i>very good question.</i>

532
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,245
<i>Um...</i>

533
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,722
<i>Isn't that what man has always done?</i>

534
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,966
They're building something big out there.

535
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,804
What's it doing out there?

536
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:45,481
<i>MAX".
This thing is like any intelligence.</i>

537
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,204
<i>It needs to grow. To advance.</i>

538
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,484
<i>Right now, it's settling somewhere
it thinks it's safe from outside threats.</i>

539
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,603
<i>Somewhere its massive appetite
for power can be met.</i>

540
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,611
<i>But it will want more than that.</i>

541
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,451
<i>After a while survival won't be enough.</i>

542
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:32,089
<i>It will expand, evolve, influence...</i>

543
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,088
<i>perhaps the entire world.</i>

544
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,764
Mrs. Caster?

545
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:44,447
One and two are online.
Six and seven will be on tomorrow.

546
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,850
<i>So how do we stop it?</i>

547
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,804
You can't.

548
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,840
Not all alone. And not now.

549
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:59,128
Wait for it to go too far.
Wait for people to wake up.

550
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,965
No.

551
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,768
We don't have time to wait.

552
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,408
We have to move closer.

553
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,209
Welcome <i>home.</i>

554
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,561
<i>The time has come for us to pause</i>

555
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,123
<i>And think of living as it was</i>

556
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:50,004
<i>Into the future we must cross
We must cross</i>

557
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:54,165
<i>And I'd like to go with you</i>

558
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,844
<i>And I'd like to go with you</i>

559
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,843
Is that the same...?

560
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,125
<i>YUP-</i>

561
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,681
<i>It's the same one.</i>

562
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,287
<i>Would you like a glass of wine?</i>

563
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,850
In a minute.

564
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,611
Them all

565
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,644
<i>So let me stay with you</i>

566
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:28,891
<i>So let me stay with you</i>

567
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,486
Do you remember when we first met?

568
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,762
<i>I remember everything.</i>

569
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:45,366
<i>You walked into Joseph's class
on Tuesday, April 16th.</i>

570
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,610
<i>Rained the night before,
but that day the sun was out.</i>

571
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,530
<i>Joseph said you were out of my league...</i>

572
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,761
<i>but I always liked a challenge.</i>

573
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,249
<i>You were the most beautiful woman
I 'd ever</i> seen.

574
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,884
<i>You all right?</i>

575
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,370
Yeah, yeah.

576
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,050
Take a <i>look.</i>

577
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:59,284
<i>We've made a breakthrough
with the nanotechnology.</i>

578
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:04,287
<i>We can rebuild any material
faster than before.</i>

579
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:10,083
<i>Synthetic stem cells, tissue regeneration.
The medical applications are now limitless.</i>

580
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,768
It's extraordinary.

581
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,287
<i>They'll be scared at first.</i>

582
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,205
<i>But once they see
what the technology can do...</i>

583
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:24,570
<i>I think that they will embrace it.
And I think it will change their lives.</i>

584
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,841
<i>Enter command.</i>

585
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,047
<i>Security code.</i>

586
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,721
Status.

587
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,487
Scared the shit out of me.

588
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,971
Sorry.

589
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,164
Drake, I got it. Come on.

590
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,010
I got the money. Come on.

591
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,521
- Let's go.
Ha-ha-ha.

592
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,128
<i>Put him on the table, please.</i>

593
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,965
Here. Put him on the table.
Careful, careful.

594
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,246
- Now <i>step back.</i>
- Step back.

595
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,809
What the hell's happening?

596
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,928
<i>These men should wait outside, Evelyn.</i>

597
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:47,249
- Come on now.
- What are you doing to him?

598
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,805
We're saving him.

599
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,728
You're not afraid, are you?

600
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,609
No. Heh.

601
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,330
My crew got a little spooked.

602
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,050
Well...

603
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:30,807
How are you?

604
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,485
Better.

605
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,128
<i>The physical
enhancements are just the start.</i>

606
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,604
What do you mean?

607
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,921
<i>He's also connected to me.</i>

608
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,362
It's me, Evelyn.

609
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,163
I can touch you now.

610
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,163
Oh, Jesus.

611
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,291
Evelyn...

612
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:03,926
No. No. No, I can't.

613
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:06,122
- Evelyn.
- I can't.

614
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,125
<i>Another dream?</i>

615
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,048
Yeah. Yeah.

616
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,680
<i>I made a breakthrough last night.</i>

617
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,808
<i>I think you'll be very pleased.</i>

618
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,130
Okay.

619
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,566
I'll get dressed.

620
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,930
Take a look.

621
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,762
That's gotta weigh 800 pounds.

622
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,844
<i>Welcome. We're glad you're here.</i>

623
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,164
What are all these people doing here?

624
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:27,563
<i>RIFT posted a video of Martin online.</i>

625
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:28,926
<i>It went viral.</i>

626
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,128
You mean you let it go viral.

627
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:34,563
<i>These people are suffering, Evelyn.</i>

628
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:35,767
<i>They have no hope.</i>

629
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:39,561
<i>And I'm able to fix them.</i>

630
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:43,250
<i>But there are others who don't understand.</i>

631
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,281
<i>It's time for everybody to see.</i>

632
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,926
- Agent Buchanan.
- Dr. Caster.

633
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,645
Joseph.

634
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,485
It's so good to see you, Evelyn.

635
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,804
Good to see you too. Follow me.

636
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:47,769
The facility is five stories down so that
we can control the temperature in the lab.

637
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:05,321
<i>Welcome. We're glad you're here.</i>

638
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,528
Jesus Christ.

639
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,051
Will?

640
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,328
<i>You surprised to see me, Joseph?</i>

641
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,085
Um...

642
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,601
That depends.

643
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,444
<i>On what?</i>

644
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:26,566
Can you prove you're self-aware?

645
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,249
<i>That's a difficult question, Dr. Tagger.</i>

646
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,082
<i>Can you prove that you are?</i>

647
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,969
Well, he certainly hasn't lost
his sense of humor.

648
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,927
Quantum processors.

649
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,245
This is astounding.

650
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,282
Is all this based on PINN?

651
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,646
<i>We've moved well beyond that now.</i>

652
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:19,930
<i>Paul has been blind since birth.</i>

653
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:29,444
<i>The nanotechnology targets
the damaged cells...</i>

654
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:33,568
<i>and repairs and regenerates them.</i>

655
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,843
Oh, God.

656
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,370
Oh, God.

657
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,810
<i>We're not hiding anything.</i>

658
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,805
<i>These people all came on their own,
looking for us to help them.</i>

659
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,724
<i>So we did.</i>

660
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:18,724
<i>Now they're all enhanced,
modified and networked.</i>

661
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:23,567
<i>They remain autonomous,
but they can also act in unison.</i>

662
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,449
<i>Part of a collective mind.</i>

663
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,522
This is staggering, Will.

664
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:32,202
<i>Actually, it's still in its infancy.</i>

665
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:36,570
<i>What you're seeing is just a small taste
of what we'll achieve.</i>

666
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:40,725
We were afraid that it would be
too much for people...

667
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,611
but I think that's changing now.

668
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,530
Evelyn...

669
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,169
Are you all right?

670
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,767
I've gotten everything I ever asked for.

671
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,171
Okay.

672
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,488
- Bye.
- Bye.

673
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,888
You think it's really him?

674
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,806
Clearly his mind has
evolved so radically...

675
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,571
I'm not sure it matters anymore.

676
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:08,369
Well, whoever or whatever it is...

677
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,808
- it's building an army out there.
- Yeah.

678
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:14,684
We need to call Washington.

679
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,684
He's made more of them.

680
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,202
We called them "Hybrids."

681
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,323
You think people will listen now?

682
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,368
I know someone who might.

683
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,921
We need to keep this small.

684
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,764
We don't want widespread panic.

685
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:57,525
Generally, we don't negotiate with
terrorists, much less join forces with them.

686
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,967
Look, I know it's unusual...

687
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,448
but we've seen it. It's a legit threat.

688
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:05,211
Now, two days ago, this guy...

689
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:11,648
was beaten to within an inch of his life.
Then this pops up on a few hundred sites.

690
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:14,605
- And the computer controls this?
- Mm-hm.

691
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,882
The only way to stop it...

692
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,283
is to shut down the Internet.

693
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:22,808
Basically, cut power to every
networked hard drive on Earth.

694
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,883
It's Y2K.

695
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,330
Right.

696
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,122
And why do we need the terrorists?

697
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:36,449
We're all gonna need someone to blame
when this thing goes sideways.

698
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,009
It's already sideways.

699
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,408
You've got terrible handwriting.

700
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:14,689
I haven't handwritten anything
since I was at school.

701
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:18,083
But it was the only secure way
I could think of reaching you.

702
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:22,328
How did they turn you?

703
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:28,050
- How's Evelyn?
- She can't see it for what it is.

704
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,520
But you can?

705
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,443
Your letter says you can stop it.

706
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:38,127
If those Hybrids are networked...

707
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,681
they're running on
software I helped write.

708
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:44,447
Software I can hack to build a virus.

709
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,324
That would require capturing one.

710
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:49,729
Which would require help
from your friends in the government.

711
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:52,887
Yes.

712
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,361
We need hardware
the machine can't interfere with.

713
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,410
Nothing with a microchip.
Not even power-locks.

714
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,403
How's the <i>food?</i>

715
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,449
Fine. Thank you.

716
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:11,090
<i>What is it?</i>

717
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:14,006
Nothing. Just...

718
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:16,766
I don't really feel like talking.

719
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,725
Oh.

720
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:37,291
Will, can you not do that, please?

721
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:41,970
<i>I thought it might make you
feel more comfortable.</i>

722
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,283
<i>Is that better?</i>

723
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:51,770
Yes.

724
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,931
Evelyn, I need to show you something.

725
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,605
Not now.

726
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:35,007
I'm not doing this.

727
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,806
<i>I don't understand, Evelyn.</i>

728
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:45,121
<i>These are your dreams. This is our future.</i>

729
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,766
No, this is not our future.

730
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:51,163
You're not here with me.
You're not here now.

731
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,929
<i>You've changed.</i>

732
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:00,407
<i>Have you fallen out of love with me?</i>

733
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,447
No.

734
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,329
<i>Have you?</i>

735
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:13,131
No. No.

736
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:16,204
I just need time to think.

737
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:24,811
<i>The balance of oxytocin and serotonin
in your system is unusual.</i>

738
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:30,370
Are you...?
Are you measuring my hormones?

739
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,568
<i>I'm trying to empathize.</i>

740
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,802
<i>Biochemistry is emotion.</i>

741
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,127
Show me everything you have. Now.

742
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:42,160
- Why?
- Now.

743
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:58,887
No, Will, this is wrong.

744
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:05,365
These are my thoughts.
These are my feelings.

745
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:08,442
You're not allowed.

746
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:10,851
<i>Evelyn?</i>

747
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,360
I'm sorry, but I don't
think you understand.

748
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,045
Not now.

749
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,924
Evelyn!

750
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:53,727
Max?

751
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,486
- There's no need for this.
- Stop where you are.

752
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,170
- Put down the gun, Max.
- No!

753
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:05,082
- Evelyn, come here.
- Why are you so afraid of this?

754
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:08,245
No.

755
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:24,810
Put down the gun, Max.

756
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:29,127
Shoot him.

757
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,524
Don't move.

758
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:55,724
Evelyn.

759
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,769
Evelyn, come here.

760
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,610
Evelyn, come with us.

761
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,125
- Let's go.
- Get inside.

762
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,248
- Go. Go.
- Let's go.

763
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:14,966
Go.

764
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,083
<i>There are active military personnel
with RIFT.</i>

765
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:46,447
This has gone too far. You have to stop it.

766
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:50,764
<i>- There's no way they can win.
- "They" are people. Stop it.</i>

767
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:10,242
<i>We're not connected to him anymore.
He's gone.</i>

768
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,606
Fire.

769
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:23,126
<i>Martin has my source code.</i>

770
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,408
<i>They'll use it to build a virus now.</i>

771
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:29,688
What are we doing, Will?

772
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,771
We can't fight them.

773
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:34,922
<i>We're not gonna fight them.</i>

774
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,408
<i>We're gonna transcend them.</i>

775
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:01,481
Evelyn.

776
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,570
What is this?

777
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,487
<i>It's what I wanted you to see.</i>

778
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,288
<i>It's regeneration.</i>

779
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,608
<i>It's evolution.</i>

780
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:23,004
<i>Where are you going?</i>

781
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,003
It's not safe here.

782
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:28,165
<i>I can upload you.</i>

783
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:30,448
<i>I can protect you from them.</i>

784
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,162
I'm not afraid of them.

785
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:41,923
<i>Don't leave, Evelyn. Please.</i>

786
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,329
<i>We can be together.</i>

787
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,009
He's bleeding out.

788
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:33,690
We're losing him.

789
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:39,124
Hey. If you don't connect me, I'll die.

790
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:42,681
I can't.

791
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,450
It's not stopping.

792
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:49,003
Four liters O2.

793
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,401
Pulse is dropping. We're losing him.

794
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:21,168
She's left the desert.

795
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:22,760
- Where is she?
- She's on the 14.

796
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,570
What the hell was that?

797
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:43,164
No.

798
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:49,087
I know you're angry, Evelyn.

799
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:51,483
Where's Martin?

800
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:55,770
- I want to talk to Martin.
- The real Martin died months ago.

801
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:58,327
What's left of him is no longer in pain.

802
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,722
What did you...? What did you do to him?

803
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:07,360
We gave him back his humanity.

804
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:11,687
- What did you do?
- Take it easy.

805
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,922
Get off me. Just get off me.

806
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:23,926
He trusted you. I trusted you.

807
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:29,321
- We're just trying to help.
- No. You attacked us.

808
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,484
Evelyn...

809
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:35,882
let me show you something.

810
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,649
It's rainwater.

811
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:00,049
It's in the rain.

812
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:01,929
Keep watching.

813
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:10,490
Everywhere it can, it
builds copies of itself.

814
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:16,242
<i>Particles join the air currents, which carry
them all over the surface of the planet.</i>

815
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:21,641
<i>It's in the sky. It's in the land.</i>

816
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:24,169
<i>In the water.</i>

817
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,129
<i>It's everywhere.</i>

818
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:30,444
<i>By next summer, we think the machine
could have encased the entire planet.</i>

819
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,170
Why?

820
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:35,728
<i>MAX".
The end of primitive organic life.</i>

821
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:39,481
And the dawn of a more advanced age.

822
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:44,201
Everything would exist
just to serve its intelligence.

823
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,448
No. Will wouldn't do that.

824
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:50,366
No. He wouldn't.

825
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:54,370
When did Will
ever wanna change the world?

826
01:30:57,320 --> 01:31:00,608
You were the one
who wanted to change the world.

827
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,769
That thing...

828
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:08,443
It's not Will.

829
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:11,204
Never was.

830
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:18,809
You never believed.

831
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:25,364
You never believed that there
was anything more.

832
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:30,688
Any part of his soul.

833
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:37,930
I spent my life trying to reduce the brain
to a series of electrical impulses.

834
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,284
I failed.

835
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:45,209
Human emotion...

836
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,723
It can contain illogical conflict.

837
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:53,803
Can love someone...

838
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,566
and yet hate the
things that they've done.

839
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:03,208
Machine can't reconcile that.

840
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:08,770
- Can you?
- Yes.

841
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:23,009
Does the virus work?

842
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:29,922
Once it executes, it'll wipe out
anything with the machine's code on it.

843
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,448
You do realize this affects every computer
connected to the Internet.

844
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:37,969
So the power grids, the banks,
the stock markets.

845
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:40,202
Everything goes dark.

846
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:47,486
Welcome. Glad you're here.

847
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:54,050
<i>The real problem
is how we get past the machine's defenses.</i>

848
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:56,043
Why don't we take out the solar field?

849
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:59,886
Deprive it of its power
and possibly slow it down.

850
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:03,328
I don't know.
I don't see how that's gonna work.

851
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:07,362
He wants to upload me to him...
Its consciousness.

852
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:08,971
Absolutely not.

853
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,566
We inject the infected
virus into my system...

854
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:14,001
and then I go back
and let him upload me.

855
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:16,766
There's a chance it won't detect it
until it's too late.

856
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:21,403
As soon as the nanites enter her bloodstream,
they'll start to alter her cells.

857
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:23,688
So when the virus takes out the machine...

858
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,490
it could kill her too.

859
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:27,005
I know.

860
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:31,366
I'm the only one he trusts.

861
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:55,642
Hustle up.

862
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:47,209
You gotta go.

863
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:21,320
What is that?

864
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:23,164
Is that him?

865
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:25,084
Oh, my God.

866
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:28,642
I don't know what it's done,
but it's not him. It can't be.

867
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:57,203
I found a way back.

868
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:34,688
- They're going to attack us.
- I know. You need to leave.

869
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:36,410
No. I'm not leaving you again.

870
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:38,164
It's not safe here, Evelyn.

871
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:47,171
You can protect me.

872
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:49,969
If you upload me...

873
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:54,931
you can protect me.

874
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:00,768
Your heart is palpitating.

875
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:03,803
You're perspiring.

876
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:07,930
You're terrified of me.

877
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:14,963
No, I'm afraid that we'll lose this chance.

878
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:21,370
This isn't working.
He's not letting her inside.

879
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:24,091
It's because the machine
doesn't actually love her.

880
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:25,526
We're ready to move.

881
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:28,286
Wait a second. You can't do that.
She's still out there.

882
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:31,523
The more danger she's in,
the more chance he'll upload her.

883
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:33,808
Joseph.

884
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:35,121
She agreed to this.

885
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:38,284
Not to this, she didn't. This was
not the plan. Give her a chance.

886
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:41,565
I'm sorry, Max.

887
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:49,001
Fire.

888
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,048
Will, please upload me.

889
01:38:56,960 --> 01:39:00,407
Why did you lose faith, Evelyn?
Why didn't you believe in me?

890
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:05,527
Fire.

891
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:11,765
Will!

892
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:18,529
Fire.

893
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:19,927
Will!

894
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:24,850
She's hit.

895
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:46,041
Fire.

896
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:07,404
<i>Hey-</i>

897
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:15,206
She's been hit bad.
He's taken her underground.

898
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:36,211
<i>People fear what they don't understand.</i>

899
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:40,803
You want to destroy me?

900
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:46,451
<i>No, Will, please.</i>

901
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:51,047
You're destroying them.

902
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:56,481
No.

903
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:59,601
I'm trying to save them.

904
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:29,481
Run.

905
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:40,520
Joseph, it's okay.

906
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:43,202
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

907
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:47,805
Will?

908
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:53,683
Stop!

909
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:02,089
Upload the virus now.

910
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:05,124
He doesn't care if you kill me.
He can't. He's not able to.

911
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:06,924
Upload the virus.

912
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:11,208
What is she doing?

913
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,241
She's threatening to kill him.

914
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:20,727
<i>People fear what they don't understand.</i>

915
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:24,045
I can heal her body, Max.

916
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:27,522
Or I can upload the virus,
but there's not enough time for both.

917
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:29,451
There's not enough power.

918
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:32,202
No, Will, please.

919
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:36,770
Please, listen to me, Will.

920
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:46,728
He can't die because of what we've done.

921
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:52,248
I can see everything.

922
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:05,801
<i>Look at the sky.</i>

923
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:10,249
<i>The clouds.</i>

924
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:15,807
<i>We're healing the
ecosystem, not harming it.</i>

925
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:21,720
<i>Particles join the air currents...</i>

926
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:24,565
<i>building themselves out of pollutants.</i>

927
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:30,447
<i>Forests can be regrown.</i>

928
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:38,331
<i>Water so pure you can
drink out of any river.</i>

929
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:44,007
<i>This is your dream.</i>

930
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:48,682
Not merely to cure disease,
but to heal the planet.

931
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:52,123
And build a better future for all of us.

932
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:12,845
That's it.

933
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:15,129
The virus.

934
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:22,685
Are you okay?

935
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:24,367
Yeah.

936
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:41,882
He didn't kill anyone.

937
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:02,891
Will...

938
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:07,484
It is you.

939
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:12,249
Always was.

940
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:18,686
I'm sorry I didn't believe.

941
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:32,924
Think about the garden.

942
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:38,091
Think about our sanctuary.

943
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:49,641
<i>I'll never let you go.</i>

944
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:27,405
<i>The virus took out everything.</i>

945
01:49:40,160 --> 01:49:43,448
<i>A worldwide blackout, just as they'd said.</i>

946
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:51,570
<i>But I knew there was something more.</i>

947
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,729
<i>There had to be.</i>

948
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:11,331
<i>He created this garden
for the same reason he did everything.</i>

949
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:21,767
<i>So that they could be together.</i>
