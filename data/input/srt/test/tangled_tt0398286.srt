00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:56,994
<i>(Flynn Ryder narrates)
This is the story of how I died.</i>

2
00:00:58,422 --> 00:01:02,638
<i>Don't worry, this is actually
a very fun story. And the truth is, it isn't even mine.</i>

3
00:01:02,639 --> 00:01:06,187
<i>This is the story of a girl named,
Rapunzel.</i>

4
00:01:06,893 --> 00:01:09,638
<i>And it starts, with the sun.</i>

5
00:01:11,193 --> 00:01:16,109
<i>Now, once upon a time, a single
drop of sunlight fell from the heavens.</i>

6
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,812
<i>And from this small drop of sun,
grew a magic, golden, flower.</i>

7
00:01:22,326 --> 00:01:26,145
<i>It had the ability to heal the sick,
and injured.</i>

8
00:01:27,245 --> 00:01:29,257
<i>Oh, you see that old woman,
over there?</i>

9
00:01:29,258 --> 00:01:31,163
<i>You might want to remember her.</i>

10
00:01:31,164 --> 00:01:32,956
<i>She's kind of important.</i>

11
00:01:33,822 --> 00:01:38,628
<i>Well, centuries pass and a hop
skip and a boat ride away there grew a kingdom.</i>

12
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:41,989
<i>The kingdom was ruled by a beloved
King and Queen.</i>

13
00:01:43,206 --> 00:01:46,125
<i>And the Queen, well she was about
to have a baby,</i>

14
00:01:46,335 --> 00:01:48,607
<i>but she got sick,</i>

15
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:50,405
<i>really, sick.</i>

16
00:01:50,406 --> 00:01:51,846
<i>She was running out of time.</i>

17
00:01:51,847 --> 00:01:54,345
<i>And that's when people usually start
to look for a miracle.</i>

18
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:57,898
<i>Or in this case, a magic golden flower.</i>

19
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,467
<i>Ahhh, I told you she'd
be important.</i>

20
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,779
<i>You see instead of sharing the
suns gift,</i>

21
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,857
<i>this woman, Mother Gothel,
hoarded its healing power</i>

22
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:09,765
<i>and used it to keep herself
young for hundreds of years.</i>

23
00:02:09,766 --> 00:02:13,846
<i>And all she had to do,
was sing a special song.</i>

24
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:21,814
<i>Mother Gothel: *Flower gleam and glow,
let your power shine*</i>

25
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:30,119
<i>*Make the clock reverse,
bring back what once was mine*</i>

26
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,821
<i>*What once was mine*</i>

27
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,836
<i>Flynn: All right, you get the jist. She sings
to it, she turns young, creepy, right?</i>

28
00:02:49,064 --> 00:02:51,099
We've found it!

29
00:02:55,789 --> 00:03:00,209
<i>Flynn: The magic of the golden flower,
healed the queen.</i>

30
00:03:01,955 --> 00:03:05,107
<i>A healthy baby girl,
a princess was born.</i>

31
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:07,208
<i>With beautiful golden hair.</i>

32
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:16,846
<i>I'll give you a hint.</i>

33
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:18,624
<i>That's Rapunzel.</i>

34
00:03:20,224 --> 00:03:26,183
<i>To celebrate her birth, the King and
Queen launched a flying lantern into the sky.</i>

35
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:33,960
<i>And for that one moment,
everything was perfect.</i>

36
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,736
<i>And then that moment ended.</i>

37
00:03:39,649 --> 00:03:49,266
<i>Mother Gothel: *Flower, gleam and glow,
let your powers shine*</i>

38
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,548
<i>*Make the clock re...*
HUH!</i>

39
00:03:58,474 --> 00:04:00,308
<i>(Baby cries)
Flynn: Gothel broke into the castle,</i>

40
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:03,159
<i>stole the child, and just like that...gone.</i>

41
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:08,763
<i>The Kingdom searched and searched,
but they could not find the Princess.</i>

42
00:04:08,768 --> 00:04:10,630
<i>For deep within the forest</i>

43
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:12,167
<i>In a hidden tower.</i>

44
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:14,084
<i>Gothel raised the child
as her own.</i>

45
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:24,010
<i>*...bring what has been lost, bring back what
once was mine, what once was mine.*</i>

46
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:26,047
<i>Flynn: Gothel had found her new magic flower.</i>

47
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:29,390
<i>But this time she was determined
to keep it hidden.</i>

48
00:04:29,391 --> 00:04:32,206
Why can't I go outside?

49
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:35,277
The outside world is a dangerous place.

50
00:04:35,278 --> 00:04:37,632
Filled with horrible, selfish people.

51
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:43,643
-You must stay here, where you're safe.
Do you understand, flower?
-Yes, Mommy.

52
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:49,977
<i>But the walls of that tower,
could not hide everything.</i>

53
00:04:55,134 --> 00:04:59,744
<i>Each year on her birthday, the King
and Queen released thousands of lanterns
into the sky.</i>

54
00:04:59,746 --> 00:05:05,525
<i>In hope that one day, their lost
Princess, would return.</i>

55
00:05:24,098 --> 00:05:25,395
HAH!

56
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:31,479
Hmm, Well I guess Pascal's
not hiding out here.

57
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:35,079
GOTCHA!

58
00:05:36,845 --> 00:05:39,293
That's twenty two for me.

59
00:05:39,294 --> 00:05:41,918
How about twenty three,
out of forty five?

60
00:05:42,807 --> 00:05:45,349
Okay, well, what do you want to do?

61
00:05:47,773 --> 00:05:50,165
Yeah, I don't think so.

62
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,025
I like it in here and so do you.

63
00:05:54,757 --> 00:05:58,437
Oh, come on Pascal, it's
not so bad in there.

64
00:06:09,878 --> 00:06:11,280
*Sings "When will my life begin"*

65
00:06:11,281 --> 00:06:15,524
<i>*7a.m. the usual morning line-up*</i>

66
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:18,742
<i>*Start on the chores I sweep
'til the floors all clean.*</i>

67
00:06:18,743 --> 00:06:23,599
<i>*Polish and wax, do laundry and
mop and shine up.*</i>

68
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:28,488
<i>*Sweep again, and by then
it's like 7:15.*</i>

69
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:32,807
<i>*So I'll read a book,
or maybe two or three.*</i>

70
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:37,515
<i>*Ill add a few new paintings
to my gallery.*</i>

71
00:06:37,516 --> 00:06:41,931
<i>*I'll play guitar, and  knit, and cook
and basically.*</i>

72
00:06:41,932 --> 00:06:45,977
<i>*Just wonder when will my
life, begin.*</i>

73
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:59,416
<i>*Then after lunch, it's puzzles,
and darts and baking.*</i>

74
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:03,936
<i>*Papier-mâché, a bit of ballet,
and chess.*</i>

75
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:08,150
<i>*Pottery, and ventriloquy, candle making.*</i>

76
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:15,474
<i>*Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch.
Take a climb, sew a dress, and I'll re-read the books.*</i>

77
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:21,131
<i>*If I have time to spare, I'll paint the wall
some more, I'm sure there's room somewhere.*</i>

78
00:07:21,131 --> 00:07:26,222
<i>*And then I'll brush, and brush, and brush,
and brush my hair.*</i>

79
00:07:26,222 --> 00:07:30,520
<i>*Stuck in the same place
I've always been.*</i>

80
00:07:30,521 --> 00:07:34,541
<i>*And I'll keep wondering, and wondering,
and wondering...*</i>

81
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:39,799
<i>*Wondering, when will my life begin?*</i>

82
00:07:41,314 --> 00:07:48,662
<i>*Tomorrow night, the lights will appear.*</i>

83
00:07:48,663 --> 00:07:57,708
<i>*Just like they do on my birthday,
each year.*</i>

84
00:07:58,943 --> 00:08:08,054
<i>*What is it like, out there
where they glow?*</i>

85
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:16,962
<i>*Now that I'm older. Mother
might just let me go.*</i>

86
00:08:40,676 --> 00:08:42,002
Wow!

87
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:44,574
I could get used to a view like this.

88
00:08:44,575 --> 00:08:47,041
-Ryder, come on.
-Hold on.

89
00:08:47,852 --> 00:08:51,624
Yep, I'm used to it.
Guys I want a castle.

90
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:55,206
We do this job, you could
buy your own castle.

91
00:09:06,432 --> 00:09:08,357
Oh, hay fever?

92
00:09:08,358 --> 00:09:09,427
Yeah.

93
00:09:11,114 --> 00:09:12,189
Huh?

94
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:15,537
Wait, wait.
Hey, wait!

95
00:09:16,444 --> 00:09:18,810
Can't you picture me in a castle of
my own?

96
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:19,895
'Cause I certainly can.

97
00:09:19,896 --> 00:09:22,428
Oh, the things we've seen and
it's only eight in the morning.

98
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:25,084
Gentlemen, this is a very big day.

99
00:09:26,314 --> 00:09:30,460
This is it. This is
a very big day, Pascal.

100
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:33,379
I'm finally going to do it.

101
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,169
-I'm going to ask her.
-RAPUNZEL!

102
00:09:36,598 --> 00:09:38,634
Let down your hair.

103
00:09:39,952 --> 00:09:40,970
It's time.

104
00:09:42,098 --> 00:09:45,512
I know, I know. Come on, don't
let her see you.

105
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:51,892
Rapunzel, I'm not getting any
younger down here.

106
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,765
Coming, mother.

107
00:10:18,237 --> 00:10:20,955
Hi, welcome home, mother.

108
00:10:20,956 --> 00:10:25,708
Oh, Rapunzel. How you manage to do
that every single day,

109
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:29,747
without fail, it looks absolutely
exhausting, darling.

110
00:10:29,748 --> 00:10:31,976
Oh, it's nothing.

111
00:10:31,977 --> 00:10:34,022
Then I don't know why it
takes so long.

112
00:10:35,563 --> 00:10:37,031
Oh, darling. I'm just teasing.

113
00:10:39,408 --> 00:10:45,054
All right...so, mother.
As you know tomorrow is a very big day.

114
00:10:45,055 --> 00:10:47,171
Rapunzel look in that mirror.
You know what I see?

115
00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:51,610
I see a strong, confident,
beautiful young lady.

116
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,211
Oh look, you're here too.

117
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:58,404
I'm just teasing, stop taking
everything so seriously.

118
00:10:58,747 --> 00:11:02,262
Okay, so mother. As I was saying, tomorrow...

119
00:11:02,263 --> 00:11:04,324
Rapunzel, mother's feeling a little run down.

120
00:11:04,325 --> 00:11:06,663
Would you sing for me, dear?

121
00:11:06,664 --> 00:11:09,337
-Then we'll talk.
-OH! Of course, mother.

122
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,317
<i>*Flower gleam and glow, Let your power shine,
Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine.*</i>

123
00:11:21,318 --> 00:11:25,180
<i>*Heal what has been hurt, Change the fate's design.
Save what has been lost, Bring back what once was mine.*</i>

124
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,215
-Rapunzel!
-So, mother,

125
00:11:27,216 --> 00:11:30,368
Earlier I was saying that tomorrow was a
pretty big day, and you didn't really respond,

126
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:32,603
So I'm just going to tell you.
It's my birthday!

127
00:11:32,604 --> 00:11:33,983
TADA!

128
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,131
No, no, no can't be.

129
00:11:35,332 --> 00:11:38,580
I distinctly remember. Your
birthday was last year.

130
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:41,941
That's the funny thing about birthdays.
They're kind of an annual thing.

131
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,682
Mother, I'm turning eighteen.

132
00:11:46,683 --> 00:11:51,480
And I wanted to ask,
what I really want for this birthday.

133
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:54,530
Actually what I want for
(Mumbles 'every birthday')...

134
00:11:54,531 --> 00:11:56,213
Rapunzel please, stop with the mumbling.

135
00:11:56,214 --> 00:11:58,250
You know how I feel about the mumbling.

136
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,348
Blah, blah, blah,...blah.
It's very annoying.

137
00:12:00,349 --> 00:12:02,893
I'm just teasing, you're adorable
I love you so much, darling.

138
00:12:09,287 --> 00:12:11,683
Oh, I want to see the floating lights.

139
00:12:13,404 --> 00:12:15,337
-What?
-Oh,...

140
00:12:15,338 --> 00:12:19,006
Well I was hoping you would
take me to see the floating lights.

141
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:22,269
Oh, you mean the stars.

142
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,053
That's the thing

143
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:28,418
I've charted stars and they're
always constant.

144
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:32,370
But these, they appear every year
on my birthday, Mother.

145
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:34,407
Only on my birthday.

146
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:37,194
And I can't help but feel that they're,

147
00:12:37,395 --> 00:12:39,462
They're meant for me.

148
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:44,192
I need see them, Mother.
And not just from my window.

149
00:12:44,193 --> 00:12:45,692

One moment, Mother.

236

I have a big surprise.

237
00:22:18,915 --> 00:22:21,187
Uh, I do too.

238
00:22:21,188 --> 00:22:23,869
Oh, I bet my surprise is bigger.

239
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,337
I seriously doubt it.

240
00:22:28,227 --> 00:22:32,273
I brought back parsnips. I'm going to make
hazel nut soup for dinner, your favorite.

241
00:22:32,274 --> 00:22:33,494
Surprise!

242
00:22:33,495 --> 00:22:36,183
Well mother, there's something
I want to tell you.

243
00:22:36,183 --> 00:22:38,868
Oh Rapunzel, you know I hate
leaving you after a fight.

244
00:22:38,869 --> 00:22:41,534
Especially when I've done
absolutely nothing wrong.

245
00:22:41,535 --> 00:22:44,329
Okay, I've been thinking a lot
about what you said, earlier.

246
00:22:45,357 --> 00:22:47,716
I hope you're not still talking
about the stars.

247
00:22:47,717 --> 00:22:50,345
Floating lights, and yes
I'm leading up to that.

248
00:22:50,346 --> 00:22:52,649
Because I really thought
we dropped the issue, sweetheart.

249
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,627
No Mother, I'm just saying,

250
00:22:54,628 --> 00:22:57,506
you think I'm not strong enough
to handle myself out there.

251
00:22:57,507 --> 00:23:00,979
Oh darling, I know you're not strong
enough to handle yourself out there.

252
00:23:00,981 --> 00:23:04,239
-But if you just...
-Rapunzel, we're done talking about this.

253
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,499
-Trust me,...
-Rapunzel.

254

-...I know what I'm
-Rapunzel.

255
00:23:06,889 --> 00:23:09,084
-Oh, come on.
-Enough with the lights, Rapunzel.

256
00:23:09,095 --> 00:23:13,626
You are not leaving this tower,
EVER!

257
00:23:19,243 --> 00:23:23,104
Oh, great. Now I'm the bad guy.

258
00:23:35,892 --> 00:23:39,054
All I was gonna say, mother
is that...

259
00:23:39,055 --> 00:23:42,358
I know what I want for my
birthday, now.

260
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:44,103
And what is that?

261
00:23:44,654 --> 00:23:50,470
New paint. That paint made from
the white shells you once brought me.

262
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:53,587
Well that is a very long trip,
Rapunzel.

263
00:23:53,588 --> 00:23:55,470
Almost three day's time.

264
00:23:55,692 --> 00:24:00,528
I just thought it was a
better idea than, uh, stars.

265
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:07,387
You sure you'll be all right,
on your own?

266
00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:10,739
I know I'm safe, as long
as I'm here.

267
00:24:18,888 --> 00:24:21,434
I'll be back in three days time.

268
00:24:21,436 --> 00:24:24,743
I love you very much, dear.

269
00:24:24,751 --> 00:24:26,699
I love you more.

270
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,245
I love you most.

271
00:24:50,681 --> 00:24:51,911
Okay.

272
00:25:07,765 --> 00:25:08,783
Hmm.

273
00:25:29,681 --> 00:25:30,481
AHHH!

274
00:25:36,928 --> 00:25:40,464
Is this...hair?

275
00:25:40,465 --> 00:25:44,081
Struggling...struggling is pointless.

276
00:25:44,146 --> 00:25:45,164
Huh?

277
00:25:47,243 --> 00:25:49,234
I know why you're here.

278
00:25:49,235 --> 00:25:51,958
And I'm not afraid of you.

279
00:25:52,249 --> 00:25:53,471
What?

280
00:26:02,496 --> 00:26:06,045
Who are you, and how
did you find me?

281
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:08,862
Ah hah.

282
00:26:09,891 --> 00:26:13,563
Who are you, and how
did you find me?

283
00:26:16,511 --> 00:26:18,363
I know not who you are.

284
00:26:18,364 --> 00:26:20,528
Nor how I came to find you.

285
00:26:20,529 --> 00:26:22,469
But may I just say.

286
00:26:23,836 --> 00:26:25,707
Hi!

287
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,353
How you doing?

288
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:30,859
The name's Flynn Ryder.

289
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,738
Flynn mumbles:
How's your day going, huh?

290
00:26:34,934 --> 00:26:39,629
Who else knows my location,
Flynn Ryder?

291
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,177
-All right, Blondie.
-Rapunzel.

292
00:26:41,665 --> 00:26:43,325
Gesundheit, here's the deal.

293
00:26:43,326 --> 00:26:46,119
I was in a situation,
Gallivanting through the forest.

294
00:26:46,201 --> 00:26:48,271
I came across your tower and...

295
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:51,634
Ho, oh no, where is my satchel?

296
00:26:51,635 --> 00:26:55,176
I've hidden it, somewhere you'll
never find it.

297
00:26:57,977 --> 00:26:59,760
It's in that pot, isn't it.

298
00:27:00,335 --> 00:27:01,455
(((Clang!!)))

299
00:27:04,262 --> 00:27:05,383
Huh?

300
00:27:05,633 --> 00:27:08,687
Ahh, will you stop that.

301
00:27:08,688 --> 00:27:11,418
Now it's hidden where you'll never find it.

302
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:15,743
So, what do you want,
with my hair?

303
00:27:15,743 --> 00:27:16,981
-To cut it?
-What?

304
00:27:16,982 --> 00:27:18,641
-Sell it?
-No!

305
00:27:18,642 --> 00:27:21,560
Listen, the only thing I want
to do with your hair,

306
00:27:21,561 --> 00:27:24,340
is to get out of it.
Literally.

307
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:27,816
Wait, you don't want my hair?

308
00:27:27,817 --> 00:27:29,793
Why on earth would
I want your hair?

309
00:27:29,794 --> 00:27:33,279
Look, I was being chased, I saw a
tower, I climbed it, end of story.

310
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,295
You're, telling the truth?

311
00:27:35,297 --> 00:27:36,749
Yes.

312
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,863
Hmmm.

313
00:27:48,785 --> 00:27:51,330
I know, I need someone
to take me.

314
00:27:51,357 --> 00:27:53,718
I think he's telling the truth, too.

315
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:57,601
Doesn't have fangs,
but what choice do I have?

316
00:27:58,621 --> 00:28:03,787
Uh, okay Flynn Ryder,
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.

317
00:28:03,788 --> 00:28:05,456
-Deal?
-Look this way.

318
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:07,037
Oh...oomph!

319
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:09,609
Do you know what these are?

320
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:12,911
You mean the lantern thing
they do for the princess?

321
00:28:12,912 --> 00:28:14,789
Lanterns...

322
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,930
I knew they weren't stars.

323
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:22,412
Well, tomorrow evening
they will light the night sky,

324
00:28:22,413 --> 00:28:26,451
with these lanterns.
You will act as my guide,

325
00:28:26,452 --> 00:28:30,062
Take me to these lanterns,
and return me home safely.

326
00:28:30,063 --> 00:28:34,341
Then, and only then, will
I return your satchel to you.

327
00:28:34,342 --> 00:28:35,539
That is my deal.

328
00:28:35,682 --> 00:28:39,245
Yeah, no can do.

329
00:28:39,246 --> 00:28:43,091
Unfortunately, the kingdom and I
aren't exactly, simpatico,

330
00:28:43,092 --> 00:28:45,383
at the moment. So I
won't be taking you anywhere.

331
00:28:52,503 --> 00:28:55,591
Something brought you here,
Flynn Ryder.

332
00:28:55,592 --> 00:28:59,788
-Call it what you will, fate, destiny.
-A horse.

333
00:28:59,789 --> 00:29:02,392
So I have made the decision to
trust you.

334
00:29:02,393 --> 00:29:03,721
A horrible decision, really.

335
00:29:03,722 --> 00:29:06,097
But trust me, when I tell you this.

336
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:12,202
You can tear this tower apart,
brick by brick.

337
00:29:12,203 --> 00:29:16,615
But without my help, you will
never find your precious satchel.

338
00:29:16,616 --> 00:29:19,588
Let me just get this straight.

339
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,476
I take you to see the lanterns.

340
00:29:21,477 --> 00:29:22,776
Bring you back home,

341
00:29:22,777 --> 00:29:24,947
and you'll give me back my satchel?

342
00:29:24,949 --> 00:29:26,205
I promise.

343
00:29:28,008 --> 00:29:32,981
And when I promise something, I never
ever break that promise.

344
00:29:35,423 --> 00:29:36,822
EVER!

345
00:29:39,902 --> 00:29:42,649
All right, listen, I didn't want
to have to want to do this,

346
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,241
but you leave me no choice.

347
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:46,656
Here comes the 'smolder'.

348
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,210
This is kind of an off day for me.

349
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,998
This doesn't normally happen.

350
00:29:58,008 --> 00:30:00,586
Fine, I'll take you to see the lanterns.

351
00:30:00,588 --> 00:30:02,087
Really!

352
00:30:02,883 --> 00:30:05,499
-Ooops.
-You broke my 'smolder'.

353
00:30:10,312 --> 00:30:12,303
You coming, Blondie?

354

358
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,486
Here I go.

359
00:30:43,872 --> 00:30:45,415

I can't believe I did this.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THIS!

372
00:32:11,561 --> 00:32:13,550
Mother would be so furious.

That's okay, what she doesn’t
know won't kill her, right?

374
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:20,354
Oh my gosh, this would kill her.

375
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,693
THIS IS SO FUN!

376
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:27,337
I am a horrible daughter,
I'm going back.

377

I am never going
baaaccckkk!

378
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:33,980
I am a despicable human being.

379

WAHHOOOOO!

380
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:38,647
Best day, ever!

381
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:50,274
You know, I can't help but notice,

382
00:32:50,275 --> 00:32:53,563
you seem a little at war
with yourself, here.

383
00:32:54,052 --> 00:32:57,015
-What?
-Now, I'm only picking up
bits and pieces,

384
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:59,427
of course, over protective mother,
forbidden road trip.

385
00:32:59,428 --> 00:33:01,012
I mean, this is serious stuff.

386
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:02,927
But let me ease your conscious.

387
00:33:02,928 --> 00:33:04,659
This is part of growing up.

388
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,778
A little rebellion, a little adventure.

389
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:08,716
That's good, healthy even.

390
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,712
(Laughs) You think?

391
00:33:11,713 --> 00:33:14,691
I know. You're way over thinking
this, trust me.

392
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,857
Does your mother deserve it?
No.

393
00:33:16,858 --> 00:33:19,358
Will this break her heart
and crush her soul?

394
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:22,360
Of course.
But you just got to do it.

395
00:33:23,256 --> 00:33:24,766
Break her heart?

396
00:33:24,767 --> 00:33:27,964
-In half.
-Crush her soul?

397
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:29,863
Like a grape.

398
00:33:29,864 --> 00:33:32,655
She would be heart broken,
you're right.

399
00:33:32,863 --> 00:33:36,566
I am, oh my, oh bother.

400
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:40,165
All right, I can't believe I'm
saying this, but...

401
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:41,812
I'm letting you out of the deal.

402
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:43,640
-What?
-Flynn: That's right.

403
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:46,234
Flynn: But don't thank me. Let's
just turn around,

404
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:47,986
and get you home, here's
your pan and your frog.

405
00:33:47,987 --> 00:33:49,742
I get back my satchel.

406
00:33:49,743 --> 00:33:51,846
You get back a mother
daughter relationship

407
00:33:51,847 --> 00:33:55,992
based on mutual trust and viola!
We part ways as unlikely friends.

408
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:00,497
-No, I am seeing those lanterns.
-Oh, come on!

409
00:34:00,498 --> 00:34:02,375
What is it going to take
to get my satchel back?

410
00:34:02,924 --> 00:34:04,451
I will use this.

411
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:10,858
Is it, ruffians, thugs?
Have they come for me?

412
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:17,788
Stay calm, it can probably smell fear.

413
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:20,485
Oh, sorry.

414
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,544
Guess I'm just a little bit, jumpy.

415
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:28,480
Probably be best if we avoid
ruffians and thugs, though.

416
00:34:28,613 --> 00:34:31,934
(Laughs)
Yeah, that probably be best.

417
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,917
Are you hungry?
I know a great place for lunch.

418
00:34:36,737 --> 00:34:39,263
-Where?
-Oh, don't you worry.

419
00:34:39,264 --> 00:34:40,782
You'll know it when you smell it.

420
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:20,876
Oh, a Palace horse.

421
00:35:20,877 --> 00:35:23,065
Where's your rider?

422
00:35:24,107 --> 00:35:25,150
Rapunzel.

423
00:35:26,283 --> 00:35:27,505
RAPUNZEL!

424
00:35:35,525 --> 00:35:39,057
Rapunzel, let down your hair.

425
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:42,518
Rapunzel?

426
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,018
Rapunzel!

427
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,770
RAPUNZEL!

428
00:36:52,187 --> 00:36:55,439
I know it's around here, somewhere.

429
00:36:56,198 --> 00:36:58,116
Ah, there it is.

430
00:36:58,117 --> 00:37:00,038
The Snuggly duckling.

431
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:02,789
Don't worry, very quaint place,
perfect for you.

432
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:06,194
Don't want you scaring, and giving
up on this whole endeavor now do we?

433
00:37:06,195 --> 00:37:09,596
-Well, I do like duckling.
-YAY!

434
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,870
Garcon, your finest table, please.

435
00:37:13,874 --> 00:37:14,987
(Gasps)

436
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,604
You smell that?
Take a deep breath through the nose.

437
00:37:24,316 --> 00:37:25,538
Really let that seep in.

438
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,553
What are you getting?
Because to me, it's part man smell.

439
00:37:28,554 --> 00:37:30,436
and the other part is
really bad man smell.

440
00:37:30,437 --> 00:37:32,872
I don't know why, but overall,
it just smells like the color brown.

441
00:37:32,873 --> 00:37:33,890
Your thoughts?

442
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,564
That's a lot of hair.

443
00:37:36,565 --> 00:37:39,521
She's growing it out, is that blood
on your moustache?

444
00:37:39,522 --> 00:37:42,117
Goldie, look at this, look at
all the blood on his moustache.

445
00:37:42,118 --> 00:37:44,578
Look sir, that's a lot of blood.

446
00:37:45,561 --> 00:37:47,438
Hey, you don't look so good, Blondie.

447
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:49,814
Maybe we should get you home.
Call it a day.

448
00:37:49,814 --> 00:37:53,023
Probably be better off. This is a five
star joint after all.

449
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:56,491
And if you can't handle this place, well
maybe you should be back in your tower.

450
00:37:56,493 --> 00:37:59,182
Is this you?

451
00:38:01,385 --> 00:38:04,175
No, no this is being mean.

452
00:38:04,176 --> 00:38:05,427
Oh, it's him all right.

453
00:38:05,428 --> 00:38:07,636
Gretel, go find some guards.

454
00:38:07,637 --> 00:38:11,810
That reward's going to
buy me a new hook.

455
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:13,254
I can use the money.

456
00:38:13,255 --> 00:38:15,284
What about me?
I'm broke.

457
00:38:16,172 --> 00:38:19,208
-Boys, stop!
-We can work this out.

458
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:21,308
Hey, leave him alone.

459
00:38:21,312 --> 00:38:25,709
-Gentlemen, please.
-Give me back my guide, ruffians.

460
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:28,111
HOO, HAH, HOO, HOO!

461
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:35,408
Not the nose, not the nose,
not the nose!

462
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,388
Put him down!

463
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:47,108
Okay, I don't know where I am,
and I need him to take me to see the lanterns,

464
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:49,425
because I've been dreaming about
them my entire life.

465
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:52,127
Find your humanity.

466
00:38:52,128 --> 00:38:54,230
Haven’t any of you ever had a dream?

467
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:08,635
I, had a dream.

468
00:39:08,636 --> 00:39:09,732
Once.

469
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:20,897
<i>(Song: I've got a dream)
*I'm malicious mean and scary.*</i>

470
00:39:20,898 --> 00:39:22,966
<i>*My sneer could curdle dairy.*</i>

471
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:26,269
<i>*And violence-wise my hands
are not the cleanest.*</i>

472
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:30,910
<i>*But despite my evil look,
and my temper and my hook.*</i>

473
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:34,419
<i>*I've always yearned to
be a concert pianist.*</i>

474
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:38,170
<i>*Can't cha see me on the stage
performing Mozart.*</i>

475
00:39:38,173 --> 00:39:41,803
<i>*Tickling the ivories,
'til they gleam.*</i>

476
00:39:41,804 --> 00:39:44,071
<i>*Yep, I'd rather be called deadly.*</i>

477
00:39:44,072 --> 00:39:47,073
<i>*For my killer show-tune medley.
Thank you.*</i>

478
00:39:47,074 --> 00:39:50,810
<i>*'Cause way down deep inside
I've got a dream.*</i>

he's got a dream.*</i>

vicious as I seem.*</i>

481
00:39:57,662 --> 00:40:00,294
<i>*Though I feel like breaking femurs.*</i>

482
00:40:00,295 --> 00:40:02,381
<i>*You can count me with the dreamers.*</i>

483
00:40:02,382 --> 00:40:05,021
<i>*Like everybody else,
I've gotta dream.*</i>

(Singing in distance)

485
00:40:10,685 --> 00:40:12,580
<i>*I've got scars and lumps and bruises.*</i>

486
00:40:12,581 --> 00:40:14,795
<i>*Plus something here that oozes.*</i>

487
00:40:14,796 --> 00:40:17,473
<i>*Let's not even mention
my complexion.*</i>

488
00:40:17,474 --> 00:40:19,625
<i>Big nose thug: *But despite my extra toes.*</i>

489
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,531
<i>*And my goiter and my nose.*</i>

490
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:24,634
<i>*I really want to make a love
connection.*</i>

491
00:40:24,635 --> 00:40:28,663
<i>*Can't you see me with a special
little lady.*</i>

492
00:40:28,664 --> 00:40:31,926
<i>*Rowing in a row boat,
down the stream.*</i>

493
00:40:31,927 --> 00:40:33,966
<i>*Though I'm one disgusting blighter.*</i>

494
00:40:33,967 --> 00:40:36,003
<i>*I'm a lover, not a fighter.*</i>

495
00:40:36,004 --> 00:40:39,057
<i>*'Cause way down deep
inside, I gotta dream.*</i>

<i>*I gotta dream,
I gotta dream.*</i>

497
00:40:42,725 --> 00:40:46,201
<i>*And I know one day
will never reign supreme.*</i>

498
00:40:46,202 --> 00:40:48,389
<i>*Though my face leaves
people screaming.*</i>

499
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,499
<i>*There's a child behind
it dreaming.*</i>

500
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,211
<i>*Like everybody else,
I've gotta dream.*</i>

501
00:40:53,212 --> 00:40:56,788
<i>*Tor would like to quit
and be a florist.*</i>

502
00:40:56,789 --> 00:41:00,790
<i>*Gunther does interior design.*</i>

503

<i>*Ulf is into mime,
Attila’s cupcakes are sublime.*</i>

<i>*Bruiser knits, Killer sews.*</i>

505
00:41:06,528 --> 00:41:08,502
<i>*Fang does little puppet shows.*</i>

506
00:41:08,503 --> 00:41:14,030
<i>*And Vladimir collects
ceramic unicorns.*</i>

507
00:41:14,031 --> 00:41:16,564
What about you?

508
00:41:16,566 --> 00:41:18,899
-I'm sorry, me?
-What's your dream?

509
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,264
No, no, no. Sorry boys,
I don't sing.

510
00:41:23,426 --> 00:41:25,297
<i>*I have dreams like you,
no really.*</i>

511
00:41:25,298 --> 00:41:26,884
<i>*Just much less, touchy-feely.*</i>

512
00:41:26,885 --> 00:41:29,796
<i>*They mainly happen somewhere
warm and sunny.*</i>

513
00:41:29,797 --> 00:41:33,938
<i>*On an island that I own,
tanned and rested and alone.*</i>

514
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,838
<i>*Surrounded by enormous
piles of money.*</i>

<i>*-I've got a dream...I've got a dream.
-(Thugs) She’s got a dream.*</i>

516
00:41:41,538 --> 00:41:45,052
<i>*I just want to see the floating
lanterns gleam.*</i>

517
00:41:45,053 --> 00:41:47,486
<i>*And with every passing hour.*</i>

518
00:41:47,487 --> 00:41:49,163
<i>*I'm so glad I left my tower.*</i>

519
00:41:49,164 --> 00:41:52,058
<i>*Like all you lovely folks,
I've got a dream.*</i>

520
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:56,142
<i>*She's gotta dream, He's gotta dream.
They've gotta dream, we've gotta dream.*</i>

521
00:41:56,143 --> 00:42:04,149
<i>*So our differences ain't
really that extreme. We're one big team.*</i>

522
00:42:04,151 --> 00:42:08,011
<i>*Call us brutal, say sadistic
and grotesquely optimistic.</i>

523
00:42:08,013 --> 00:42:10,945
<i>*'Cause way down deep inside,
we've gotta dream.*</i>

524
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:13,259
<i>*We gotta dream,
I gotta dream.*</i>

525
00:42:16,598 --> 00:42:20,578
<i>*Yes way down deep inside
I've got a...*</i>

526
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:26,637
<i>*Dreeeeeeaaaaamm.*</i>

527
00:42:26,638 --> 00:42:28,240
Yeah!

528
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,281
I found the guards.

529
00:42:34,816 --> 00:42:36,351
Where's Ryder,
where is he?

530
00:42:36,352 --> 00:42:38,509
I know he's in here somewhere.

531
00:42:38,511 --> 00:42:41,624
Find him, turn the place
upside down if you have to!

532
00:42:57,623 --> 00:43:00,417
Go, live your dream.

533
00:43:00,418 --> 00:43:01,762
I will.

534
00:43:01,763 --> 00:43:04,306
Your dream stinks,
I was talking to her.

535
00:43:06,506 --> 00:43:07,991
Thanks for everything.

536
00:43:11,768 --> 00:43:14,719
I believe this is the man
you're looking for.

537
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,537
You got me.

538
00:43:17,379 --> 00:43:19,007
Sir, there's no sign of Ryder.

539
00:43:23,278 --> 00:43:24,533
Maximus.

540
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,399
What's he doing?

541
00:43:43,165 --> 00:43:46,181
A passage, come on men,
let's go.

542
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:49,234
Corman, make sure those
boys don't get away.

543
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:55,173
Play it safe.

544
00:43:57,471 --> 00:43:58,896
We'll go get the crown.

545
00:44:06,687 --> 00:44:10,482
I gotta dream,
I got some dream.

546
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:15,451
I..., ohhh, somebody get me a glass.

547
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:19,682
Because I just found me a
tall drink of water.

548
00:44:19,683 --> 00:44:23,770
Oh stop it, you big lug.

549
00:44:23,771 --> 00:44:26,249
Where does that tunnel lead out?

550
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,326
Knife!

551
00:44:29,745 --> 00:44:31,224
Well, that got us safe.

552
00:44:31,225 --> 00:44:34,564
Didn't know you had that in you
back there. That was pretty, impressive.

553
00:44:34,565 --> 00:44:36,907
I KNOW!

554
00:44:36,908 --> 00:44:39,683
I know...

555
00:44:42,165 --> 00:44:44,927
Sooo, Flynn.

556
00:44:44,928 --> 00:44:46,128
Where are you from?

557
00:44:46,129 --> 00:44:48,314
Whoa, whoa, sorry Blondie,
I don't do back story.

558
00:44:48,315 --> 00:44:51,211
However I am becoming very
interested in yours.

559
00:44:51,212 --> 00:44:53,687
Now I...I know I'm not suppose
to mention the hair.

560
00:44:53,688 --> 00:44:55,501
-Nope.
-Or, the Mother.

561
00:44:55,502 --> 00:44:58,345
-Uh, uh.
-Frankly I'm to scared to
ask about the frog.

562
00:44:58,346 --> 00:44:59,702
-Chameleon.
-Nuance.

563
00:44:59,703 --> 00:45:03,656
Here's my question though, if you want
to see the lanterns so badly,

564
00:45:03,657 --> 00:45:06,014
why haven't you gone before?

565
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:09,877
Uhh, hey, well...

566
00:45:14,075 --> 00:45:16,387
Uh, Flynn...

567
00:45:17,021 --> 00:45:18,275
Flynn!

568
00:45:20,605 --> 00:45:22,232
Run,
RUN!

569
00:45:40,576 --> 00:45:41,771
Who's that?

570
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:42,975
They don't like me.

571
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,404
-Who's that?
-They don't like me either.

572
00:45:46,123 --> 00:45:48,707
-Who's that?
-Lets just assume for the moment,

573
00:45:48,707 --> 00:45:50,224
that everyone here doesn't like me.

574
00:45:50,234 --> 00:45:51,724
Here.

575
00:46:00,865 --> 00:46:02,993
I've waited a long time for this.

576
00:46:12,247 --> 00:46:15,843
Oh mama, I have got to get me
one of these.

577
00:46:16,581 --> 00:46:17,600
HAH!

578
00:46:24,046 --> 00:46:28,807
You should know that this is
the strangest thing I've ever done.

579
00:46:33,468 --> 00:46:35,243
How 'bout two out of three?

580
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:37,626
Flynn!

581
00:46:41,787 --> 00:46:44,027
Flynn, look out.

582
00:46:44,055 --> 00:46:46,365
-Whoa, WHOAAA!
-Hold on.

583
00:46:49,305 --> 00:46:51,911
You should see your faces.
Because you look...

584
00:46:52,379 --> 00:46:53,600
Ridiculous

585
00:47:00,941 --> 00:47:02,172
Come on, Blondie.

586
00:47:02,346 --> 00:47:03,466
Jump.

587
00:48:32,294 --> 00:48:36,052
It's no use,
I can't see anything.

588
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:42,767
Hey, there's no point.

589
00:48:42,768 --> 00:48:44,611
It's pitch black down there.

590
00:48:52,731 --> 00:48:53,840
This is all my fault.

591
00:48:55,921 --> 00:48:58,627
She was right, I never
should have done this.

592
00:49:03,099 --> 00:49:04,437
I'm so...

593
00:49:05,321 --> 00:49:07,728
I'm so sorry, Flynn.

594
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:16,946
Eugene.

595
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:19,269
What?

596
00:49:19,681 --> 00:49:22,100
My real name is,
Eugene Fitzherbert.

597
00:49:23,872 --> 00:49:25,675
So you might as well know.

598
00:49:28,588 --> 00:49:32,132
I have magic hair that glows
when I sing.

599
00:49:32,133 --> 00:49:33,193
What?

600
00:49:35,379 --> 00:49:39,496
I have magic hair,
that glows when I sing.

601
00:49:40,573 --> 00:49:43,849
<i>*Flower gleam and glow.
Let your power shine.*</i>

602
00:50:33,451 --> 00:50:35,013
We made it.

603
00:50:35,607 --> 00:50:36,877
Her hair glows.

604
00:50:36,878 --> 00:50:39,602
We're alive.
I'm alive!

605
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:42,434
I didn't see that coming.
You're hair actually glows.

606
00:50:42,435 --> 00:50:44,324
-Eugene...
-Why does her hair glow?

607
00:50:44,325 --> 00:50:45,643
-Eugene!
-What?

608
00:50:46,783 --> 00:50:49,474
It doesn't just glow.

609
00:50:51,902 --> 00:50:53,534
Why is he smiling at me?

610
00:51:18,007 --> 00:51:19,229
I'll kill him.

611
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:20,958
I'll kill that, Ryder.

612
00:51:22,332 --> 00:51:24,451
We'll cut him off at the kingdom.

613
00:51:24,452 --> 00:51:26,679
And get back the crown, come on.

614
00:51:28,138 --> 00:51:29,268
Boys.

615
00:51:30,563 --> 00:51:35,350
Perhaps you want to stop acting
like wild dogs chasing their tails,

616
00:51:35,351 --> 00:51:37,457
and think for a moment.

617
00:51:39,528 --> 00:51:41,858
Oh, please there's no
need for that.

618
00:51:47,311 --> 00:51:51,140
Well if that's all you desire,
then be on your way.

619
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:54,072
I was going to offer you something
worth one thousand crowns,

620
00:51:54,073 --> 00:51:56,085
would have made you
rich beyond belief.

621
00:51:56,086 --> 00:51:58,083
And that wasn't even the best part.

622
00:51:58,084 --> 00:51:59,670
Oh well, C'est la vie.

623
00:51:59,671 --> 00:52:01,924
Enjoy  your crown.

624
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,165
What's the best part?

625
00:52:05,629 --> 00:52:10,518
It comes with revenge
on Flynn Ryder.

626
00:52:17,137 --> 00:52:21,885
So you're being strangely cryptic as  you wrap
your magic hair around my injured hand.

627
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:24,289
Sorry.

628
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:29,861
Just don't, don't freak out.

-Ah...
-Please don't freak out.

639
00:53:32,916 --> 00:53:35,120
Ahhh. I'm not freaking out,
are you freaking out?

640
00:53:35,121 --> 00:53:38,584
No, I'm just very interested in your hair.
and the magical qualities that it possesses.

641
00:53:38,585 --> 00:53:40,383
How long has it been
doing that, exactly?

642
00:53:42,029 --> 00:53:44,175
Forever, I guess.

643
00:53:45,453 --> 00:53:48,709
Mother said when I was a baby
people tried to cut it.

644
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:51,104
They wanted to take it for themselves.

645
00:53:51,114 --> 00:53:53,411
But, once it's cut.

646
00:53:53,412 --> 00:53:56,100
It turns brown, and looses its power.

647
00:53:56,794 --> 00:54:00,437
A gift like that, it has to be protected.

648
00:54:00,975 --> 00:54:03,680
That's why Mother never let me...

649
00:54:07,054 --> 00:54:11,627
That's why...I never left the...

650
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:15,528
You never left that tower.

651
00:54:19,228 --> 00:54:21,545
And you're still gonna go back?

652
00:54:21,847 --> 00:54:24,286
No...yes.

653
00:54:26,023 --> 00:54:28,033
It's complicated.

654
00:54:38,863 --> 00:54:41,918
So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?

655
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:45,672
Ah yeah, well. I'll spare
you the sob story of

656
00:54:45,673 --> 00:54:48,760
poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert, it's
a little bit of a...

657
00:54:48,761 --> 00:54:50,473
It's a little bit of a downer.

658
00:54:56,746 --> 00:54:58,341
There was this book.

659
00:54:58,342 --> 00:55:00,942
A book I used to read every
night to all the younger kids.

660
00:55:00,943 --> 00:55:02,760
The tales of Flynnigan Ryder.

661
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:05,560
Swashbuckling rogue,
richest man alive.

662
00:55:05,561 --> 00:55:09,543
Not bad with the ladies either. Nothing
to ever brag about, of course.

663
00:55:10,459 --> 00:55:12,061
Was he a thief too?

664
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:15,699
Ahh, well no.

665
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:19,245
Actually, he had enough
money to do anything that he wanted to do.

666
00:55:19,246 --> 00:55:20,978
He could go anywhere that
he wanted to go.

667
00:55:20,994 --> 00:55:24,168
And...and, for a kid,
with nothing.

668
00:55:24,169 --> 00:55:26,182
I don't know, I...

669
00:55:27,193 --> 00:55:28,665
It just seemed like a better option.

670
00:55:29,445 --> 00:55:32,161
You can't tell anyone,
about this, okay?

671
00:55:32,163 --> 00:55:34,727
It could ruin my whole reputation.

672
00:55:35,006 --> 00:55:37,634
Ahh, we wouldn't want that.

673
00:55:37,635 --> 00:55:40,406
Oh, the thing about a reputation,
it's all that a man has.

674
00:55:40,408 --> 00:55:41,843
(Laughs)

675
00:55:47,713 --> 00:55:50,726
Um, well I should uh...

676
00:55:51,406 --> 00:55:54,172
I, I should get some
more firewood.

677
00:55:54,786 --> 00:55:55,803
Hey.

678
00:55:56,904 --> 00:56:02,205
For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert
much better than, Flynn Ryder.

679
00:56:04,106 --> 00:56:06,994
Well, then you'd be the first.

680
00:56:07,657 --> 00:56:08,979
But, thank you.

681
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:21,123
Well, I thought he'd never leave.

682
00:56:21,124 --> 00:56:22,422
Mother?

683
00:56:22,423 --> 00:56:24,427
Hello, dear.

684
00:56:24,428 --> 00:56:26,543
But I...I..., don't we...

685
00:56:26,757 --> 00:56:28,565
How did you find me?

686
00:56:28,566 --> 00:56:30,501
Oh, it was easy really.

687
00:56:30,502 --> 00:56:34,981
I just listened for the sound of
complete and utter betrayal,
and followed that.

688
00:56:37,362 --> 00:56:39,563
-Mother...
-We're going home, Rapunzel.

689
00:56:39,564 --> 00:56:41,990
-Now.
-You...You don't understand.

690
00:56:41,991 --> 00:56:43,826
I've been on this incredible journey.

691
00:56:43,827 --> 00:56:46,037
And I've seen and learned so much.

692
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:48,831
I even met someone.

693
00:56:48,832 --> 00:56:51,173
Yes, the wanted thief.
I'm so proud.

694
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:53,291
-Come on, Rapunzel.
-Mother, wait.

695
00:56:53,604 --> 00:56:54,831
I think

696
00:56:56,171 --> 00:56:58,315
I think he likes me.

697
00:56:58,316 --> 00:57:00,934
Likes you? Please, Rapunzel,
that's demented.

698
00:57:00,935 --> 00:57:03,975
-But mother, I...
-This is why you never should have left.

699
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:08,181
Dear this whole romance that
you've invented,

700
00:57:08,182 --> 00:57:12,955
just proves you're to naive to be here.

701
00:57:12,955 --> 00:57:16,233
Why would he like you?
Oh come on now, really.

702
00:57:16,792 --> 00:57:19,518
Look at you, you think
that he's impressed?

703
00:57:20,366 --> 00:57:23,870

Is there any chance that I'm going
to get super strength in my hand?

Because I'm not going to lie.

Hey, you all right?

Just um, lost in thought,
I guess.

I mean because here's the thing.

Superhuman good looks,
I've always had 'em.

Drop it.

you, do they?

Do they?

01:00:38,029 --> 01:00:40,614
Oh come on, he's a bad horse.

Oh, he's nothing but
a big sweetheart.

You've got to be
kidding me.

Look, today is kinda the
biggest day of my life.

763

And the thing is, I need you
not to get him arrested.

764
01:01:00,122 --> 01:01:02,604
Just for twenty four hours and then,

765
01:01:02,605 --> 01:01:04,864
you can chase each other to
your hearts content.

Okay?

767

And it's also my birthday.
Just so you know.

Thank you.

Hey, Max.

778

Where are we going?

781
01:04:35,308 --> 01:04:37,560
Well, best day of your life.

782
01:04:37,561 --> 01:04:39,562
I figured you should have
a decent seat.

783
01:04:57,499 --> 01:04:59,094
You okay?

784
01:05:00,232 --> 01:05:01,764
I'm terrified.

785
01:05:02,434 --> 01:05:04,111
Why?

786
01:05:04,413 --> 01:05:08,730
I've been looking out the
window for eighteen years.

787
01:05:08,731 --> 01:05:13,580
Dreaming about what it would feel
like when those lights rise in the sky.

788
01:05:15,057 --> 01:05:18,777
What if it's not everything
that I dreamed it would be?

789
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:22,767
It will be.

790
01:05:24,131 --> 01:05:26,107
And what if it is?

791
01:05:27,278 --> 01:05:29,212
What will I do then?

792
01:05:29,213 --> 01:05:30,974
Well that's the good part,
I guess.

793
01:05:31,787 --> 01:05:33,946
You get to go find a new dream.

I have something for you, too.

808
01:08:36,939 --> 01:08:40,399
I should have given it to you
before, but I was just scared.

809
01:08:40,563 --> 01:08:44,335
And the thing is,
I'm not scared anymore.

Huh? Oh yes.

829
01:10:47,389 --> 01:10:49,594
Uh, yes of course.

01:10:49,595 --> 01:10:51,613
I just...

831
01:10:57,204 --> 01:10:58,894
I'm sorry, everything is fine.

There's just something I

Okay.

834
01:11:07,457 --> 01:11:09,483
I'll be right back.

835
01:11:15,459 --> 01:11:17,376
It's all right, Pascal.

Ahh, there you are.

837
01:11:26,736 --> 01:11:29,906
I've been searching everywhere for
you guys. Since we got separated.

838
01:11:29,907 --> 01:11:32,406
Hey the sideburns are coming
in nice, huh?

01:11:32,408 --> 01:11:33,974
You gotta be excited about that.

841
01:11:36,174 --> 01:11:39,308
Anyhow, just wanted to say,

842
01:11:39,309 --> 01:11:42,169
I shouldn't have split.
The crown is all yours.

843
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:46,381
I'll miss you, but I think
its for the... best.

844
01:11:47,593 --> 01:11:51,039
Holding out on us again?
Hey, Ryder?

845
01:11:51,294 --> 01:11:54,297
-What?
-We heard you found something.

846
01:11:54,298 --> 01:11:57,443
Something much more valuable
than a crown.

847
01:11:57,923 --> 01:12:01,242
We want her, instead.

848
01:12:10,212 --> 01:12:14,904
I was starting to think you
ran off with the crown and left me.

849
01:12:21,265 --> 01:12:23,027
He did.

850
01:12:23,752 --> 01:12:26,013
What?
No.

851
01:12:26,014 --> 01:12:27,037
He wouldn't.

852
01:12:27,804 --> 01:12:29,679
See for yourself.

853
01:12:34,076 --> 01:12:35,515
Eugene?

854
01:12:38,102 --> 01:12:39,481
Eugene!

855
01:12:42,063 --> 01:12:43,728
Fair trade.

856
01:12:43,729 --> 01:12:47,360
A crown, for the girl
with the magic hair.

857
01:12:47,361 --> 01:12:52,324
How much do you think someone
will pay to stay young and healthy forever?

858
01:12:52,325 --> 01:12:54,169
No, please.

859
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:55,493
NO!

860
01:12:55,791 --> 01:12:56,861
NO!

861
01:13:00,274 --> 01:13:01,292
AHH!

862
01:13:05,218 --> 01:13:06,542
Rapunzel!

863
01:13:08,026 --> 01:13:09,044
Mother?

864
01:13:13,986 --> 01:13:16,696
Oh, my precious girl.

865
01:13:16,697 --> 01:13:18,387
Mother.

866
01:13:19,015 --> 01:13:20,543
Are you all right?

867
01:13:20,544 --> 01:13:21,874
Are you hurt?

868
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:25,342
-Mother, how did you?
-I was so worried about
you dear.

869
01:13:25,343 --> 01:13:26,754
So I followed you.

870
01:13:26,755 --> 01:13:28,619
And I saw them attack you.

871
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:31,443
All right, let's go, let's go
before they come to.

872
01:14:01,515 --> 01:14:03,230
You were right, mother.

873
01:14:03,231 --> 01:14:05,877
You were right about everything.

874
01:14:06,753 --> 01:14:08,549
I know darling.

875
01:14:10,117 --> 01:14:11,135
I know.

876
01:14:23,994 --> 01:14:25,189
Look!

877
01:14:25,949 --> 01:14:27,172
The crown.

878
01:14:27,692 --> 01:14:29,117
Rapunzel.

879
01:14:29,721 --> 01:14:31,175
RAPUNZEL!

880
01:14:34,233 --> 01:14:35,714
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
Guys, guys.

881
01:14:38,598 --> 01:14:40,547
Rapunzel!

882
01:14:59,945 --> 01:15:02,121
Let's get this over with, Ryder.

883
01:15:03,961 --> 01:15:05,474
Where are we going?

884
01:15:08,897 --> 01:15:10,578
Oh...

885
01:15:13,412 --> 01:15:15,996
There, it never happened.

886
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,597
Now, wash up for dinner.

887
01:15:20,602 --> 01:15:23,300
I'm making hazel nut soup.

888
01:15:27,708 --> 01:15:30,807
I really did try, Rapunzel.

889
01:15:30,808 --> 01:15:33,037
I tried to warn you,
what was out there.

890
01:15:33,934 --> 01:15:36,959
The world is dark, and selfish,

891
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,198
and cruel.

892
01:15:38,198 --> 01:15:41,418
If it finds even the slightest
ray of sunshine.

893
01:15:41,419 --> 01:15:44,350
It destroys it.

894
01:17:26,065 --> 01:17:28,082
How did you know about her?

895
01:17:28,084 --> 01:17:29,233
Tell me, now!

896
01:17:29,234 --> 01:17:30,484
It wasn't us.

897
01:17:30,484 --> 01:17:31,955
It was the old lady.

898
01:17:31,956 --> 01:17:33,585
Old lady?

899
01:17:35,551 --> 01:17:37,078
Wait, no, wait!

900
01:17:37,079 --> 01:17:38,912
You don't understand,
she's in trouble.

901
01:17:38,913 --> 01:17:39,872
Wait!

902
01:17:40,128 --> 01:17:41,146
Rapunzel?

903
01:17:43,064 --> 01:17:44,967
Rapunzel, what's going on up there?

904
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:50,733
Are you all right?

905
01:17:52,113 --> 01:17:53,674
I'm the lost princess.

906
01:17:54,156 --> 01:17:57,779
Oh, please, speak up, Rapunzel.
You know how I hate the mumbling.

907
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:59,665
I am the lost Princess.

908
01:18:00,399 --> 01:18:01,706
Aren't I?

909
01:18:04,959 --> 01:18:07,387
Did I mumble, Mother?

910
01:18:07,853 --> 01:18:10,330
Or should I even call you that?

911
01:18:11,876 --> 01:18:14,848
Oh, Rapunzel, do you even hear yourself?

912
01:18:14,849 --> 01:18:17,446
Why would you ask such
a ridiculous question?

913
01:18:17,447 --> 01:18:20,654
It was you!
It was all, you.

914
01:18:22,878 --> 01:18:26,533
Everything I did, was to protect you.

915
01:18:28,129 --> 01:18:31,296
-Rapunzel.
-I spent my entire life,

916
01:18:31,297 --> 01:18:34,270
Hiding from people who
would use me for my power.

917
01:18:34,271 --> 01:18:36,751
-Rapunzel!
-And I should have been hiding.

918
01:18:36,752 --> 01:18:37,795
From you.

919
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:39,007
Where will you go?

920
01:18:39,007 --> 01:18:40,994
He won't be there for you.

921
01:18:40,995 --> 01:18:42,821
What did you do to him?

922
01:18:42,822 --> 01:18:46,807
That criminal, is to
be hanged for his crimes.

923
01:18:46,924 --> 01:18:50,516
-No.
-Now, now. It's all right.

924
01:18:50,517 --> 01:18:51,578
Listen to me.

925
01:18:51,579 --> 01:18:55,071
All of this is as
it should be.

926
01:18:55,072 --> 01:18:56,178
NO!

927
01:18:56,895 --> 01:18:59,503
You were wrong about the world.

928
01:18:59,504 --> 01:19:01,749
And you were wrong about me.

929
01:19:01,751 --> 01:19:06,255
And I will never let you
use my hair, again!

930
01:19:15,632 --> 01:19:17,281
You want me to be the bad guy?

931
01:19:17,282 --> 01:19:19,178
Fine.

932
01:19:19,179 --> 01:19:21,703
Now I'm the bad, guy.

933
01:19:35,796 --> 01:19:37,128
What's this?

934
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:39,008
Open up.

935
01:19:40,012 --> 01:19:41,819
What's the password?

936
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:43,584
-What?
-Nope.

937
01:19:43,585 --> 01:19:45,217
Open this door.

938
01:19:45,218 --> 01:19:47,122
Not even close.

939
01:19:47,123 --> 01:19:48,322
You have three seconds

940
01:19:48,323 --> 01:19:49,711
One...

941
01:19:50,927 --> 01:19:51,946
Two...

942
01:19:53,761 --> 01:19:55,057
Three...

943
01:19:58,060 --> 01:19:59,591
(((Clang!)))

944
01:20:00,023 --> 01:20:02,739
Frying pans.
Who knew, right?

945
01:20:06,293 --> 01:20:07,311
AAAAH!

946
01:20:19,294 --> 01:20:20,378
(Thug roars)

947
01:20:32,305 --> 01:20:33,608
-Head down?
-Head down.

948
01:20:33,609 --> 01:20:34,718
-Arms in?
-Arms in.

949
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:35,793
-Knees apart?
-Knees apart.

950
01:20:35,794 --> 01:20:36,777
Knees apart?

951
01:20:37,351 --> 01:20:39,964
Why do I need to keep my
knees apar...

952
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:43,206
AAAAAAAAH!

953
01:20:47,277 --> 01:20:48,686
Max.

954
01:20:48,699 --> 01:20:50,690
You brought them here?

955
01:20:52,921 --> 01:20:54,080
Thank you.

956
01:20:55,445 --> 01:20:58,128
No really, thank you.

957
01:20:58,128 --> 01:21:03,843
Uh, I feel maybe this whole time
we've just misunderstanding one another.

958
01:21:03,844 --> 01:21:07,016
And we're really just, yeah
your right. We should go.

959
01:21:14,694 --> 01:21:15,794
Max.

960
01:21:16,307 --> 01:21:17,334
Max!

961
01:21:20,422 --> 01:21:22,993
WHOAAAAA!

962
01:21:29,038 --> 01:21:32,607
Okay Max, lets see how
fast you can run.

963
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:52,985
Rapunzel.

964
01:21:54,553 --> 01:21:56,466
Rapunzel, let down your hair.

965
01:22:12,216 --> 01:22:14,685
Rapunzel, I thought I'd never
see you again.

966
01:22:23,482 --> 01:22:25,545
Now look what you've done,
Rapunzel.

967
01:22:26,327 --> 01:22:27,968
Oh don't worry, dear.

968
01:22:27,969 --> 01:22:30,327
Our secret will die with him.

969
01:22:31,772 --> 01:22:33,782
And as for us?

970
01:22:35,331 --> 01:22:39,888
We are going where no one
will ever find you, again.

971
01:22:46,364 --> 01:22:49,866
Rapunzel, really.
Enough all ready.

972
01:22:49,867 --> 01:22:52,364
Stop fighting me.

973
01:22:52,366 --> 01:22:54,776
NO! I won't stop.

974
01:22:54,777 --> 01:22:58,449
For every minute of the rest
of my life I will fight.

975
01:22:58,450 --> 01:23:02,267
I will never stop trying
to get away from you.

976
01:23:04,481 --> 01:23:07,177
But, if you let me save him...

977
01:23:07,178 --> 01:23:08,878
I will go with you.

978
01:23:09,564 --> 01:23:12,847
No. No, Rapunzel.

979
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:16,764
I'll never run, I'll never
try to escape.

980
01:23:16,765 --> 01:23:20,565
Just let me heal him. And
you and I will be together.

981
01:23:20,566 --> 01:23:22,370
Forever, just like you want.

982
01:23:22,371 --> 01:23:24,604
Everything will be
the way it was.

983
01:23:25,652 --> 01:23:27,647
I promise.

984
01:23:27,967 --> 01:23:29,769
Just like you want.

985
01:23:32,818 --> 01:23:36,106
Just...let me...heal him.

986
01:23:41,957 --> 01:23:45,567
In case you get any ideas
about following us.

987
01:23:46,616 --> 01:23:48,507
Eu..Eugene!

988
01:23:49,946 --> 01:23:52,372
Ah, AHHH!

989
01:23:53,727 --> 01:23:56,422
Oh, I'm so sorry.

990
01:23:56,423 --> 01:23:58,951
-Everything is going to okay, though.
-No, Rapunzel!

991
01:23:58,952 --> 01:24:01,356
-I promise, you have to trust me.
-No..

992
01:24:01,357 --> 01:24:04,122
-Come on.
-I can't let you do this.

993
01:24:04,123 --> 01:24:06,732
And I can't let you die.

994
01:24:06,733 --> 01:24:09,444
-But if you do this.
-Shhh.

995
01:24:09,446 --> 01:24:11,581
-Then you...will die.
-Hey.

996
01:24:12,862 --> 01:24:14,619
It's gonna be all right.

997
01:24:19,885 --> 01:24:22,940
Rapunzel, wait...

998
01:24:32,198 --> 01:24:34,200
Eugene, what...?

999
01:24:34,277 --> 01:24:35,907
NOOO!

1000
01:24:40,721 --> 01:24:43,629
No...NO!

1001
01:24:44,091 --> 01:24:48,047
What have you done?
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!

1002
01:24:54,435 --> 01:24:57,506
No, no, no,
NOOO!

1003
01:24:58,046 --> 01:25:01,778
No, no, no, noooo.

1004
01:25:03,690 --> 01:25:04,707
NO!

1005
01:25:05,786 --> 01:25:07,723
Noooooooooo!

1006
01:25:25,946 --> 01:25:28,452
No, no, no, no, Eugene.

1007
01:25:31,239 --> 01:25:33,640
Oh, look at me, look me,
I'm right here.

1008
01:25:33,641 --> 01:25:35,746
Don't go, stay with me, Eugene.

1009

<i>*Flower gleam and glow,

-Rapunzel...
-What?

1012
01:25:47,982 --> 01:25:50,026
You were my new dream.

1013
01:25:53,342 --> 01:25:55,269
And you were mine.

Rapunzel?

1020
01:27:45,203 --> 01:27:46,383
Eugene.

1021
01:27:48,299 --> 01:27:51,574
Did I ever tell you, I've
got a thing for brunettes?

1022

<i>(Eugene narrates)
Well, you could imagine what
happened next.</i>

1023
01:29:40,216 --> 01:29:42,093
<i>The kingdom rejoiced.</i>

1024
01:29:42,094 --> 01:29:43,905
<i>For the lost Princess had returned.</i>

1025
01:29:43,906 --> 01:29:46,063
<i>The party lasted an entire week.</i>

1026
01:29:46,064 --> 01:29:48,679
<i>And, honestly I don't
remember much of it.</i>

1027
01:29:49,604 --> 01:29:51,308
<i>Dreams came true
all over the place.</i>

<i>That guy went on to become the
most famous concert pianist in the world,

1029
01:29:58,102 --> 01:30:00,734
<i>And this guy? Well he eventually
found true love.</i>

1030
01:30:02,490 --> 01:30:04,808
<i>As for this guy, well,
I assume he's happy.</i>

1031
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:06,320
<i>He's never told me otherwise.</i>

<i>Thanks to Maximus, crime in the kingdom
disappeared almost over night.</i>

<i>Pascal?
Never changed.</i>

1035

<i>At last Rapunzel was home,</i>

1036
01:30:27,558 --> 01:30:29,251
<i>and she finally had a real family.</i>

1037
01:30:30,908 --> 01:30:33,056
<i>She was a Princess worth
waiting for.</i>

1038
01:30:33,758 --> 01:30:35,457
<i>Beloved by all, she led her kingdom</i>

1039
01:30:35,458 --> 01:30:38,798
<i>with all the grace and wisdom that
her parents did before her.</i>

1040
01:30:39,678 --> 01:30:41,563
<i>And as for me, well.</i>

1041
01:30:41,564 --> 01:30:43,142
<i>I started going by Eugene again.</i>

1042
01:30:43,143 --> 01:30:45,286
<i>Stopped thieving, and basically
turned it all around.</i>

1043
01:30:45,287 --> 01:30:47,027
<i>But I know what the big question is.</i>

1044
01:30:47,898 --> 01:30:49,684
<i>Did Rapunzel and I ever get married?</i>

1045
01:30:50,317 --> 01:30:51,350
<i>Well I'm pleased to tell you.</i>

1046
01:30:51,353 --> 01:30:54,117
<i>That after years, and years of asking,</i>

1047
01:30:54,118 --> 01:30:56,118
<i>and asking, and asking.</i>

1048
01:30:57,815 --> 01:30:59,739
<i>I finally said yes.</i>

1049
01:30:59,952 --> 01:31:01,503
*Eugene*

1050
01:31:01,505 --> 01:31:04,285
<i>All right, I asked her.</i>

1051
01:31:04,286 --> 01:31:06,358
And we're living happily ever after.

1052
01:31:07,625 --> 01:31:09,028
Yes, we are.
