1
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,640
<i>Send him in.</i>

2
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,200
<i>Will you commit to this program?</i>

3
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,370
<i>I can't.</i>

4
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,380
<i>Will you commit to this program?</i>

5
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,890
<i>Will you commit to this program?</i>

6
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,930
<i>I can't.</i>

7
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,420
<i>There's no place
it won't catch up to you.</i>

8
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,960
<i>It's how every story ends.</i>

9
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,710
<i>It's what you are, Jason, a killer.</i>

10
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,300
<i>You always will be.</i>

11
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,930
<i>Go ahead. Go on. Go on!
Do it! Do it!</i>

12
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,180
<i>She wouldn't want me to.</i>

13
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,730
<i>That's the only reason you're alive.</i>

14
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,270
Who is "she"?

15
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,110
Marie Kreutz, his girlfriend.

16
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,820
She was killed in India.

17
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,030
Director of Operations Ward Abbott arranged it.

18
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,160
So we have a dirty section chief
who kills Bourne's girl.

19
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,460
Bourne comes back for revenge,
tapes Abbott's confession

20
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,620
and Abbott commits suicide.

21
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,830
Now Bourne's gunning for us.

22
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,670
You couldn't make this stuff up.

23
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,050
Bourne's last confirmed location
was Moscow, six weeks ago.

24
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,180
- Right.
- Sir.

25
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,930
He's on the run.
He's dangerous.

26
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,220
Well, sir, with respect,
I think something else could be going on here.

27
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,640
What? What's he after?

28
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,190
The reason Bourne went to Moscow
was to see the daughter of his first target.

29
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,560
What's your point, Pam?

30
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,150
Maybe he was retracing his steps.

31
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,030
He's looking for something.
Something in his past.

32
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,240
Maybe he hasn't found it yet
and we need to know what it is.

33
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,160
Are you telling me he's not
a threat to this agency?

34
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,160
I think if he wanted to hurt us,
he could have sent the tape to CNN.

35
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,040
Maybe he still will.

36
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,880
My number one rule is hope for the best,
plan for the worst.

37
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:47,510
As far as I'm concerned, Bourne is still
a serious threat until proven otherwise.

38
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,100
Let's keep looking.

39
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,060
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

40
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,940
This one's three years ago.
They had half of Interpol after him.

41
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,730
Turned up in Naples, Berlin, Moscow...

42
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,480
Disappeared again.

43
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,570
The girl that he was on the run with.

44
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:50,950
Marie Kreutz. She was found dead
in a river halfway round the world.

45
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,620
She'd been shot in the head.

46
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,370
What connects the dots?

47
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,430
Turn off the tape recorder.

48
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,890
Where's my sister?

49
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,190
Why don't you sit down?

50
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,160
Where is she?

51
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,460
She's dead.

52
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,220
She was killed.

53
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,760
I'm sorry.

54
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,070
I knew this could end this way.

55
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,150
It was always gonna end this way.

56
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,450
I didn't believe that.

57
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,710
And how did she die?

58
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,460
She was shot.

59
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,550
We were together in India.

60
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,640
He came for me.

61
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,480
You killed him?

62
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,940
Yes.

63
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,480
And now what?

64
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,990
Someone started all of this
and I'm gonna find them.

65
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,500
Hey. It's me.

66
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,840
Yeah. He knows the whole story.

67
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,430
Bourne's just the tip of the iceberg.

68
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,390
Have you heard of an Operation Blackbriar?

69
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,560
I'm gonna get my head around this
and type it up.

70
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,730
I'll see you first thing.

71
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:04,980
Okay.

72
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,950
Scanning. GoSat 21.
I have a hit on ECHELON. Blackbriar.

73
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,540
I repeat, Blackbriar.

74
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,040
Looks like it's coming
from a European signal.

75
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,830
NSA, please confirm your receipt.

76
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,460
<i>I'll bring up the frequency and the coordinates.</i>

77
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,920
Intercept of our principal--

78
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,090
- Sir!
- What you got?

79
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,050
We intercepted a call in London.
Keyword, "Blackbriar."

80
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,470
Okay, send it to New York right away.

81
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,450
Track the phone?

82
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,580
Registered to a London reporter
named Simon Ross.

83
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,240
Works at the <i>Guardian</i> newspaper.

84
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,700
- You're tracking him?
- Sir. Yeah.

85
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,790
Thanks, Mike.

86
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,330
We have a survey team covering him at work

87
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,290
and a sneak and peek's
on their way to his apartment.

88
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,420
Well, who talked to him?
How did he find out about Blackbriar?

89
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,010
I don't know.
We pulled his background

90
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,050
and ran a cross-check
on any known anomalies.

91
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:21,140
We've come up with nothing. But I think
if we follow Ross, we're gonna be able--

92
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,970
Ray, Ross is easy.
We want the source.

93
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,120
<i>Have you heard of an Operation Blackbriar?</i>

94
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,450
<i>You have details?</i>

95
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,910
<i>I'm gonna get my head around this
and type it up.</i>

96
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,330
<i>I'll see you first thing.</i>

97
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,160
- Is that all?
- Yeah.

98
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,260
I want rendition protocols
and put the asset on standby, just in case.

99
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,930
People, listen up!
This is a full priority situation.

100
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,510
Jimmy, give me Ross' profile on one.

101
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,180
Yes, sir.

102
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,890
Our target is a British national,
Simon Ross. A reporter.

103
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,690
I want all his phones, his Blackberry,
his apartment, his car,

104
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,030
bank accounts, credit cards,
travel patterns.

105
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,190
I want to know what he's gonna think
before he does.

106
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,030
Every dirty little secret he has.

107
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,450
And most of all, we want the name
and real-time location of his source.

108
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,750
This is NSA priority level four.
Any questions?

109
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,290
All right, let's get to it.

110
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,820
<i>What?</i>

111
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,200
<i>Will you commit to this program?</i>

112
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,630
<i>I can't.</i>

113
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,890
Copy that. Mr. Wills,
the subject is entering his office.

114
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,350
Give me some eyeballs on the street.

115
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,730
Where's my picture, please?

116
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,230
Coming online.

117
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,810
Online now.

118
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,570
Jimmy, how you doing with the phone line?

119
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,570
Yeah, we have an office line.
We're working on his cell.

120
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,610
- How long?
- An hour, sir.

121
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,240
That's too long.

122
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,620
So how do we know he's not
spinning for someone?

123
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,830
There was more. He was scared.

124
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,250
- Scared about what?
- Blackbriar.

125
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,460
- Sorry. Call for you.
- Who is it?

126
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,500
Won't give his name.

127
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,920
Excuse me.

128
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,630
- He's on my line.
- Thanks.

129
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,550
Simon Ross.

130
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,970
Camera three, screen.

131
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,350
Why aren't we hearing this?

132
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,300
Jimmy?

133
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,100
That's a hard line, Jimmy.
Why don't we have it?

134
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,480
We have his line, sir, but he's not on it.
He's using a different phone.

135
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,900
<i>I've been reading your stories.</i>

136
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,570
- Who is this?
- <i>This is Jason Bourne.</i>

137
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:08,070
Waterloo Station. South entrance.
Thirty minutes. Come alone.

138
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,620
Get me audio as soon as you can, Ted.

139
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,200
Street teams Alpha, Bravo.

140
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,700
Okay, guys, Let's work it. Come on.

141
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,540
Where's he going?

142
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,670
Okay, he is on the move.
Give me eyeballs on the street. Let's go.

143
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,020
Subject exiting the building.

144
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,480
All right, everyone,
let's find out where he's going.

145
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,570
<i>Mobile One, I need audio.</i>

146
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,940
<i>Audio engaged.</i>

147
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,740
Mobile One should have him.
Mobile One should have him.

148
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,610
Get Mobile One on it.
Let me know when you hear it.

149
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,680
Hi.

150
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,120
<i>Waterloo Station, south entrance.</i>

151
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,330
- Mr. Wills.
- Where's he going?

152
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,700
Destination is Waterloo Station.

153
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,790
Okay, Waterloo Station.

154
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,330
Give me eyes at Waterloo.
Put everyone in play.

155
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,460
- Let's activate the asset.
- <i>Mobilize Tracker Three.</i>

156
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,940
- Are we at the bridge yet?
- Not yet, sir.

157
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,110
Okay, Mobile Three,
tell them to stay back.

158
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,190
Sir.

159
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,480
Please maintain visual contact.

160
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,000
Prepaid phone.

161
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,750
Here you go.

162
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,510
<i>Mobile One, give me
the subject's current location.</i>

163
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:01,940
Copy that.

164
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,440
Sir, the subject is arriving
at the south entrance of Waterloo Station.

165
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,610
Hello?

166
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,820
Give me that on five and seven as well.

167
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,990
Jimmy, I need that phone.

168
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,410
<i>I want you to listen very carefully
to what I'm about to tell you.</i>

169
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,530
What the hell's going on?

170
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,830
Ten o'clock, to your left, across the street,
there's a silver Chrysler Voyager.

171
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,160
<i>There's a surveillance team inside.</i>

172
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,210
<i>Directly across the street,
twelve noon,</i>

173
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,210
<i>there's a man on the second story,
static post.</i>

174
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,960
He's watching you.

175
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,840
Now, there's a bus stop
50 meters to your left.

176
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
I want you to walk towards it.

177
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,930
Jimmy, I need that phone!
I need it yesterday.

178
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,090
He's on the move.
He's on the move.

179
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,300
That's not his phone, sir.

180
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,430
Say again?

181
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,640
That's not his phone, sir.

182
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,970
What do you mean
that's not his phone?

183
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,770
Where the hell did he get another phone?

184
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,890
<i>Well, no, you just have to--</i>

185
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,400
<i>Grab Team B, stand by.</i>

186
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,810
Grab Team B.
We're in position.

187
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,940
All right, there's a man
in a blue hooded sweatshirt.

188
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,030
<i>He's talking on a phone.
Walk directly to him and stop.</i>

189
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,910
Jimmy, we need the call.
I need that cell phone.

190
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,370
Do not let him get out of sight.

191
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,370
All right, turn around.

192
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,130
Okay, who's the guy
in the blue hood?

193
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,000
Is that his contact?

194
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,170
All right, there's a bus coming.
It'll be there in ten seconds.

195
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,550
When it stops, I want you
to walk directly to your left.

196
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,510
<i>There's an overpass. Go up the stairs.
Stop at the newsstand.</i>

197
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,010
<i>You'll get further instructions.</i>

198
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,720
Okay. Okay.

199
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,890
Get ready to move.

200
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,390
Watch that bus.
Watch that bus.

201
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,690
What? All right, what's going on?

202
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,190
- Somebody tell me. We lost the feed.
- Grab Team B.

203
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,900
Intercept the contact
and stay with Ross.

204
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,320
Hey! Stop!

205
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,530
Mobile One.
Target's on the move.

206
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,120
Okay, he's on the move.
Do not lose Ross.

207
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,080
Blue hood! Down! Now!

208
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,540
Go! Let's go.

209
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,000
Oh, shit.

210
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,720
What the hell was that?

211
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,140
Sir, we've lost all communication
with Mobile One.

212
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,600
To the right! Heading west.
Let us know when you get a visual!

213
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,730
What was the last known position, please?

214
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:56,280
On the walkway,
heading towards the concourse, sir.

215
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,410
It's a surveillance nightmare.
It's the busiest terminal in London.

216
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,240
Give me all of CCTV's eyes.

217
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,320
On it, sir.

218
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,200
Sir, asset's on scene.

219
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,400
Who's your source?

220
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,940
What's his name?
What's your source's name?

221
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,360
Look, what's going on?
Why are these people after me?

222
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,730
Because you found something.

223
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,690
You talked to someone inside Treadstone.

224
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,570
Someone who was there
at the beginning. Who is it?

225
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,950
You know I can't tell you that.

226
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:47,330
You have no idea what you're into here.
These people will kill you, if they have to.

227
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,500
Was it Blackbriar?
Is that what this is?

228
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,830
What's Blackbriar?

229
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:54,380
Treadstone upgrade.
My source told me it all started with you.

230
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,670
He said that you were square one,
the dirty little secret.

231
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,010
He said he knows who you are.

232
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,680
All right, we have to move.

233
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,220
Answer your phone.

234
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,520
- Coming online.
- You got visual?

235
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,020
Where the hell is he, people?

236
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,570
Do exactly as I say.
I need you to move up to your right.

237
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,910
First escalator on the right.

238
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,130
Tie your shoe. Tie your shoe right now.
Tie your shoe.

239
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,270
Wait.

240
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,480
<i>Wait.</i>

241
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,940
I'm gonna walk by you.
I want you to move along the far wall

242
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,030
to your left in four, three, two, one.

243
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,450
Stand up.

244
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,910
That's it.

245
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,410
Where the hell is he?

246
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,580
We cannot afford to lose this guy, people.

247
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,630
All right, that line you're on is good.
Stay on that line. Stay on that line.

248
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,590
I've gotta go and pick up the kids.
Can you go and get the shopping done?

249
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,760
Oh, the bin man,
I think he's one of them.

250
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,600
The garbage man? Negative.

251
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,430
Oh, Jesus. Jesus!
He's reaching for something.

252
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,600
- Oh, God, he's got a gun.
- <i>Stay on the line.</i>

253
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,100
He's got a gun.
He's got a gun.

254
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,810
Stay on the line you're on.
Do not deviate.

255
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,070
Okay, there he is!
Here he goes.

256
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,150
Grab Team A. Go!

257
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,400
He's still talking to somebody.

258
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,150
He's getting instructions.
Jimmy, get me the conversation.

259
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,570
- Mobile Two, I want--
- Come on, lock the box.

260
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,200
- Lock the box.
- Move in, Grab Team C.

261
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,950
<i>Hurry, Ross. We gotta move.</i>

262
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,660
Okay, move through this crowd.
Move through this crowd.

263
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,460
Get undercover right now.
Move through this crowd.

264
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,840
Get in the store.

265
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,880
<i>There's someone on your tail.
Get in the store.</i>

266
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,470
You're gonna proceed
out the east exit.

267
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:11,640
That's to your right
as you come into the store.

268
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,650
Head into the liquor store
in front of you.

269
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,230
<i>Go into the back
and lock the door.</i>

270
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,990
Mobile Four is down.

271
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,030
This guy's got help.
Tell me when the asset's in the nest.

272
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,330
Get me a feed in there!

273
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,580
I want Grab Team C in there.
Tell me what's going on.

274
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,510
Team Four is mobile.

275
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,050
Jesus Christ.

276
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,220
That's Jason Bourne.

277
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,390
He's picking us apart.
Do you think he's the source?

278
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,060
He's gotta be.

279
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:44,270
Block all the exits.
Give the asset a green light.

280
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,360
Take them both out.

281
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,540
Stay there.

282
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:11,420
I'm gonna get us out of here.
You gotta do exactly what I say.

283
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,550
Listen to me!
This isn't some story in a newspaper.

284
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,720
This is real. You understand me?

285
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,390
Okay.

286
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,150
Call all agents back.

287
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,740
Give Bourne's location
at the back of the store to the asset.

288
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,780
Yes, sir.

289
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,970
Kill the cameras.

290
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,060
- <i>Bourne.</i>
- Wait. Something's not right.

291
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,190
I can see the entrance from here.
If I go now, I can make it.

292
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,440
Bourne?

293
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,280
Just stay where you are.

294
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,530
<i>I don't think we should wait!</i>

295
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,870
<i>I think someone's coming.</i>

296
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:19,990
<i>I'm going for it.</i>

297
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,200
No, no, no, no, no!

298
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,810
We have a situation.

299
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,310
Yeah.

300
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,110
Director Kramer would like to see you.

301
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,320
We need to get those warrants--

302
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,700
He said it's urgent.

303
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,050
<i>What the police will tell me is
that they believe the victim is 35-year-old</i>

304
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,510
<i>Simon Ross, a well-known journalist

313
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,390
Hi, how are you?
Right over there?

314
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,640
All right.

315
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,810
- Good morning, sir. Can I take your order?
- Yes.

316
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:18,770
I'll have the Heart-Healthy omelet
with goat cheese and peppers, please.

317
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,730
- Anything for you, ma'am?
- Just coffee, please.

318
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,990
Are you sure? I'm buying.

319
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,150
I'm good.

320
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,990
So, when the Director called
and it was suggested that we bring you on--

321
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,040
Suggested? You sure
it was just a suggestion?

322
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,210
You know, it's funny
how different things look

323
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,090
depending on where you sit, right?

324
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,720
I look at this as a favor for you, Pam,

325
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,050
giving you an opportunity
to complete some unfinished business.

326
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,390
Meaning?

327
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,140
Bourne. He's here.
He's a threat.

328
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,560
And we both want the same thing.

329
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,230
But we both go about it
in two very different ways.

330
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,820
The past is past, Pam.
All right?

331
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,240
We were careless in Stockholm.

332
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,990
So what was Waterloo?
Just careless again?

333
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:10,410
We had a leak.
A serious national security situation.

334
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:13,370
Bourne showed up on our surveillance
and we had very little time to react.

335
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:15,750
And a reporter got killed.

336
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,750
Bourne saw us coming.
The question is what was he doing there?

337
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,250
No, the real question is how you managed

338
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,800
to get into a firefight
at a public train station.

339
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,970
You know as well as I do
decisions made in real time are never perfect.

340
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:30,140
Don't second-guess an operation
from an armchair.

341
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,390
I'll see you at the office.

342
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,650
Enjoy your egg whites.

343
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,120
People!

344
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,380
This is Pamela Landy
and her associate, Tom Cronin.

345
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,800
She's gonna be quarterbacking
the search effort.

346
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,340
Say your names.
State your specs, please.

347
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:11,470
Well, let's do names later, okay?
What's Bourne's last fixed position?

348
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,010
<i>London, 1200 Zulu.</i>

349
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,100
Status. What is he?
Armed? Wounded?

350
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,930
Alive, mobile and unknown.

351
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,480
- Do we have an ECHELON package?
- Yes.

352
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,650
- Why isn't it on?
- We were waiting.

353
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,980
Waiting? For what?
What-- Listen,

354
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,070
<i>people, do you have any idea
who you're dealing with?</i>

355
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,320
<i>This is Jason Bourne.</i>

356
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,860
<i>You are nine hours behind
the toughest target you have ever tracked.</i>

357
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,330
Now, I want everyone to sit down,
strap in and turn on all you've got.

358
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,330
That would mean now!

359
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,830
Thank you.

360
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,330
Give me a team deployment plan.

361
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:45,500
I want everything you got on Ross
on screen one.

362
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,530
Sir, I think we have something.

363
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,570
We just hacked Ross' e-mail account
at the <i>Guardian.</i>

364
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:14,200
Found a round-trip ticket
to Turin, Italy, yesterday.

365
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,910
0800 arrival, 1205 departure.

366
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,540
I think we can be pretty certain
that Bourne's not your source, then.

367
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,660
How?

368
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,250
Ross's call to his editor
where he said he'd just met the source

369
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:27,380
took place just after
his Turin flight landed.

370
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,590
- He met his source in Turin.
- So?

371
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:32,220
What? So, what?
Bourne met Ross in Turin for breakfast

372
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,600
and then at noon the same day Bourne calls Ross
to demand a meet at Waterloo?

373
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,510
Maybe they were even
on the same flight.

374
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,470
Pull up everything you've got.

375
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,810
Cross-check the secure cell phone usage
of everyone with SCI clearance

376
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,020
against all calls going in and out
of Turin, Italy, the morning Ross was there.

377
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:49,610
This guy you're after is a CIA operative
with clearance above top secret.

378
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,450
He's committing treason
by talking to Ross.

379
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,530
Do you really think while doing that

380
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,700
he's gonna use a cell phone
that he knows we can track?

381
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,450
Zero results on the cross-check.

382
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,290
So, you got any better ideas?

383
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,500
Yeah, look at all the people
whose cell phones were switched off

384
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,250
the entire period Ross was in Turin.

385
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,120
I mean, if your people are on their phones
as much as mine,

386
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,540
the list should be pretty small.

387
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:15,800
Three names.
Tom Brewster, Jack Boulin and Neal Daniels.

388
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:18,720
Okay, now check everything in Ross' apartment
against those names.

389
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,430
Check for common patterns.

390
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,980
Look for anything
that indicates who Ross met.

391
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,310
Pull up his socials.
Pull it up.

392
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,810
See those documents?

393
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,440
Break it.

394
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,190
Over here. What is that?

395
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,110
All right. Right there. Initials.

396
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,950
Pull that up.
Bring that up on main.

397
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:42,450
Neal Daniels.

398
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,370
He's station chief in Madrid, isn't he?

399
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:45,620
Yeah.

400
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,420
All right, call the RSO at the embassy.

401
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,880
Have them take Daniels into custody,
if he is there.

402
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,800
Anna, get grab teams to the <i>Calle Norte</i> safe house.

403
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,390
Send them in heavy.
Tell them we'll assist with the entry.

404
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,560
Heavy? Daniels isn't really
that much of a--

405
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,020
I'm worried about Bourne.

406
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,560
If he is not the source,

407
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,100
then he is after the source,
the same as we are.

408
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,430
ETA, Team Two.

409
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,970
Three minutes to destination, sir.

410
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,790
<i>Your mission will save American lives.</i>

411
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,800
<i>Really give yourself to this program.</i>

412
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,800
<i>I can't.</i>

413
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,470
<i>You can.</i>

414
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,850
Sir, they're at the front door.

415
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,240
- Five seconds.
- Put it up live.

416
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,210
<i>We're in.</i>

417
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,590
The alarm's down.

418
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,720
That's gotta be Bourne.

419
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,810
- <i>The safe is empty.</i>
- Shit.

420
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,690
<i>Looks like he left in a hurry.</i>

421
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,110
Track Daniels' passports.

422
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,400
Stand by.

423
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,850
Hammond.

424
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,300
God damn it!
Get a backup team in there!

425
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,980
Get me a secure line in there.
Get the second team over there now!

426
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:28,070
What are you doing here?

427
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,830
I was posted here after Berlin.

428
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,660
Where's Daniels?

429
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,590
Where is he?

430
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,360
Hello?

431
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,650
Who is this?

432
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,660
This is Nicky Parsons.

433
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,410
She was Treadstone. Logistics.

434
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:16,620
She was with us
when we hunted Bourne in Berlin.

435
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,040
Nicky, I need to do an ID challenge.

436
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,800
Code in, Sparrow.

437
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,140
Response, Everest.

438
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:45,400
Nicky, this is Noah Vosen.
How long have you been on-site?

439
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,110
I just walked in.

440
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:51,910
<i>We have two officers on-site.
Are you in contact with them?</i>

441
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:58,580
They're down.
Unconscious but alive.

442
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,540
Any sign of Neal Daniels?

443
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,670
No.

444
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,460
Nicky, this is Pam Landy.

445
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,300
<i>We have reason to believe
there's a connection between</i>

446
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,640
Neal Daniels and Jason Bourne.

447
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:19,310
Bourne? You're still looking for Bourne?
I thought that case was closed.

448
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:22,230
No, some people are convinced
he's still a threat.

449
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,770
I disagree, but to find out
I need to talk to him.

450
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,440
Hold on, Nicky.

451
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,280
What the hell are you doing?
I'm trying to send him a message.

452
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,700
You don't think Bourne is a threat?
He just took out two more of my men.

453
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,370
The only way this has a happy ending, Noah,

454
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,660
is if we bring him in alive.

455
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,660
He is going after Daniels.

456
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,500
He wants revenge, Pam,
and the only realistic way

457
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,580
to end this is to eliminate the threat.

458
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,540
How long until backup?

459
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,500
Nicky, I need you to stay put
and secure the premises.

460
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:51,510
<i>Backup will be arriving in
approximately one hour. Do you copy?</i>

461
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,800
<i>Copy, sir.</i>

462
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,020
How long do I have?

463
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,190
Three minutes.

464
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:07,440
My car's outside.

465
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,990
I know where Daniels is.

466
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,260
Come on.

467
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:33,260
Two minutes to destination, sir.

468
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,470
Grab Teams A and B--

469
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,340
Where was Daniels headed?

470
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:40,770
At 8:00 this morning,
he wired $100,000 to a bank account in Tangier.

471
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,400
Right, that's 300 miles away.
If we hurry, we can make the morning ferry.

472
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,520
Where are you parked?

473
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:50,900
To the right, 20 meters,
north side of the street.

474
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:57,620
They're coming.

475
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,780
Keep moving.

476
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,700
Two subjects seen exiting safe house.

477
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,760
What the hell is this?

478
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:18,600
Wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no!

479
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:27,060
What the hell just happened?

480
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:28,810
We've lost visual contact
with the subjects, sir.

481
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:29,860
Christ!

482
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,610
Issue a standing kill order on Jason Bourne,
effective immediately.

483
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,070
Send out a system one alert
to all Spanish contacts.

484
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,290
I want all air and ground border exits
locked down.

485
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,310
What's going on?

486
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,900
What's Daniels got?

487
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,650
What's Operation Blackbriar?

488
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:20,450
Do you want to tell me,
or should I call Kramer and ask him?

489
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,290
For Christ's sake, Pam,
we're in the middle of an operation.

490
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,660
Bullshit.

491
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,880
You want Jason Bourne,

492
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,340
level with me.

493
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:45,220
Operation Blackbriar started
as an NEAT surveillance program.

494
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:46,470
And what is it now?

495
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,890
It is now the umbrella program
for all our black ops.

496
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:53,730
Full envelope intrusion, rendition,
experimental interrogation

497
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:56,070
is all run out of this office.

498
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:01,160
We are the sharp end
of the stick now, Pam.

499
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,740
Lethal action?

500
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,540
If we have to, sure.

501
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:10,250
That's what makes us special.
No more red tape.

502
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,330
No more getting the bad guys
caught in our sights,

503
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,670
then watching them escape

504
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,880
while we wait for someone in Washington
to issue the order.

505
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,840
Oh, come on.

506
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:25,140
You've seen the raw intel, Pam.
You know how real the danger is.

507
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:27,770
We need these programs now.

508
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:29,770
What's the connection to Daniels?

509
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:33,560
He ran all of our operations
in Southern Europe and North Africa,

510
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:35,060
so he has everything.

511
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:38,820
Names, dates, ghost sites,
who's cooperating with us abroad.

512
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,780
Every operation.

513
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:43,660
You want that stuff in Bourne's hands,
out on the market to the highest bidder?

514
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,410
I don't think so.

515
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:50,960
Bourne's not after money.
He's after Daniels for a reason.

516
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,380
Well, what does it matter
what Bourne is after?

517
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,840
When we find Daniels, and,
believe me, we'll find him,

518
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,590
if you're right,

519
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,180
we get Bourne, too.

520
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:32,750
Why did you come back?

521
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,380
Why are you looking for Daniels?

522
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:49,010
Do you know who that is?

523
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:52,020
That's Daniels.

524
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:56,480
I don't know who that is.
Who is he?

525
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:04,400
He was there at the beginning.

526
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:07,530
I remember meeting him.

527
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:11,620
The first day.

528
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,750
Daniels brought me to him.

529
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,750
That's where it all started for me.

530
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:23,380
Something happened to me
and I need to know what it was

531
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:27,930
or I'll never be free of this.

532
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,720
Daniels said the training was experimental.

533
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,440
Behavior modification.

534
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,190
They had to break down the agents
before they became operational.

535
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,280
He said you were the first one.

536
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,370
Why are you helping me?

537
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,250
It was difficult for me

538
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,130
with you.

539
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,530
You really don't remember anything.

540
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:29,570
No.

541
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,870
We have to move.

542
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:52,800
Sir? Mr. Wills?
You're gonna want to look at this.

543
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,230
He's in Tangier.

544
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,620
Noah Vosen.

545
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,920
We have found Daniels.

546
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:32,340
They've just tracked Daniels' passport
to a hotel in Tangier.

547
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:34,300
They're holding up a bank transfer he made
to keep him in place

548
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:37,100
while they bring an asset
up from Casablanca.

549
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,640
They're gonna take him out.

550
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:47,940
Yeah.

551
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:50,070
<i>It's Pam Landy.
She says it's urgent.</i>

552
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,280
Tell her I'm unavailable.

553
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,410
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

554
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:51,420
Sir, asset has arrived at the airport.

555
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:16,110
Give me the subject's location.

556
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,450
Subject is now on foot
and entering Hotel Velasquez.

557
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:21,580
Hotel is 2.2 kilometers from the bank.

558
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:26,620
All right, get an elevation
and a floor plan, tic-tac-toe.

559
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:27,830
Locate the room.

560
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,340
Give the asset subject location

561
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,340
and the route between
the subject's hotel and the bank.

562
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:49,060
Do we have that room yet?

563
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:51,400
Yes, sir. It's room 117.

564
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,360
All right, get a hold
of the hotel trunk line.

565
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:58,030
Run all calls through here
with an ISO on room 117.

566
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,920
His location's being blocked
by the firewall.

567
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,420
No, they found Daniels.
They know where he is.

568
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:18,300
They'll get one of the operatives
to terminate him.

569
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,890
Find out who.

570
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:24,890
<i>Desh.</i>

571
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:30,650
Tell him you're gonna meet him
and you have a new phone for him.

572
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,900
If you stop Desh,
they'll just get someone else.

573
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,940
No, we're not gonna stop him,
we're gonna follow him.

574
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,280
He'll take us right to Daniels.

575
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,240
Sir, the asset is deviating off course.

576
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:21,070
Let it play.

577
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,400
Asset unscheduled stop.

578
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:28,890
Sir, asset is on the move
en route to subject.

579
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:31,140
Sir, we have an unauthorized breach.

580
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:34,440
Someone with active system knowledge
penetrated our protocol.

581
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,360
Instructions were sent to the asset
at 1411 local time.

582
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,110
Trace is confirmed and valid.

583
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:43,490
It came from a computer
belonging to Nicky Parsons.

584
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,950
Where did the course deviation occur?

585
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:51,620
South to <i>Rue de Belgique,</i>
stationary <i>Place de France.</i>

586
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,830
That's where Parsons is.

587
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,130
When we're finished with Daniels,
send the asset after her.

588
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,210
Yes, sir.

589
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:00,510
We find Parsons, we find Bourne.

590
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:02,630
Noah, what are you doing?

591
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:04,590
- Not now.
- I wanna know what's going on.

592
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:06,010
I said not now!

593
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:08,390
What basis are you continuing
this operation on?

594
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:11,310
On the basis that Nicky Parsons
has compromised a covert operation.

595
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:12,560
She is up to her neck in this!

596
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,310
This is about Daniels, not Nicky!

597
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:15,560
She has betrayed us.

598
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:17,230
You don't know the circumstances, Noah.

599
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:19,110
She's in league with Jason Bourne,
for Christ's sakes!

600
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:22,030
You do not have the authority to kill her!

601
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:25,200
Oh, yes, I do.
And you had better get on board.

602
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,240
Noah, she's one of us.

603
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,290
You start down this path,
where does it end?

604
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,870
It ends when we've won.

605
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:49,220
When we're finished with Daniels,
send the asset after them.

606
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,470
Yes, sir.

607
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,600
- Okay, come on.
- Stand by--

608
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,500
- Two minutes, sir.
- Two minutes.

609
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:17,290
Tell the bank to release the funds.

610
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,770
Hello?

611
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,610
He's on the move.

612
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:22,770
On it, sir.

613
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:23,980
Two hundred meters.

614
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:25,860
Okay, come on,
I want to lay in some preliminary tracking.

615
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,330
Stop!

616
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,620
Code it in.
We need to be dead.

617
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:32,290
Sir? Asset confirms both targets are down.

618
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:44,390
I want to be sure about this.

619
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:46,560
Ask the station chief from Rabat
to confirm the deaths

620
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,350
and do a sub-rosa collection of the bodies.

621
01:09:48,430 --> 01:09:50,440
I want to tie this thing off completely.

622
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,560
And keep an eye on Landy.

623
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:03,660
Yeah?

624
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:05,410
<i>Bourne and Nicky Parsons are dead.</i>

625
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:07,330
You sure about that?

626
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:10,250
<i>Our station chief in Rabat is confirming.</i>

627
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:14,170
I can't afford to have this
come back to me.

628
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:17,380
Don't worry. You're protected.

629
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,470
Just remember why we put Landy there.

630
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,510
If Blackbriar goes south,

631
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,560
we'll roll it up,
hang it around her neck and start over.

632
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,920
I can see their faces.

633
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,930
Everyone I ever killed.

634
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:49,720
I just don't know their names.

635
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:07,370
Marie used to try to

636
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:12,120
help me remember the names.

637
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:26,840
I've tried to apologize for--

638
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,640
For what I've done.

639
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:34,930
For what I am.

640
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:40,150
None of it makes it any better.

641
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:58,750
They're gonna come for you again.

642
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:06,010
You're gonna have to run now.

643
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,430
We should go.

644
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:01,830
It gets easier.

645
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:06,350
Station chief in Rabat just called.

646
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,110
They found a body.

647
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:12,190
- Bourne?
- Desh.

648
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:21,540
Pam. You need to see this.

649
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:32,010
A passport for Gilberto de Piento
just cleared immigration.

650
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:35,470
It's an early Treadstone identity
registered to Jason Bourne,

651
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:38,640
but he never used it,
and it never went to the grid.

652
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,260
Bourne's alive.

653
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:48,900
They don't know?

654
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:51,980
Well, if they knew,
Vosen wouldn't be in his office right now.

655
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:53,530
It's a hell of a risk.

656
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:57,320
<i>Maybe Bourne wants us to know.</i>

657
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:00,740
<i>Just like Naples.
Maybe he's communicating.</i>

658
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,950
Maybe he's trying to communicate with you.

659
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:06,410
Then we should communicate back.

660
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:09,380
I think I know what Bourne's looking for.

661
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,680
<i>Gilberto de Piento.
Gilberto de Piento.</i>

662
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,010
<i>Your party is waiting for you.</i>

663
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:56,900
Pamela Landy.

664
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:58,900
<i>I hear you're still looking for me.</i>

665
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:03,530
Bourne?

666
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:05,280
<i>What do you want?</i>

667
01:19:08,830 --> 01:19:09,830
Yeah?

668
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:12,170
<i>Better get in here.
We got a situation.</i>

669
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,130
I...

670
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:18,460
I wanted to thank you for the tape.

671
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:22,800
<i>It's all tied off. It's over.</i>

672
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,140
<i>I guess I owe you an apology.</i>

673
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:28,220
Is that official?

674
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:31,180
<i>No. Off the record.
You know how it is.</i>

675
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:32,230
You tracing this?

676
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:33,810
Fifty seconds to trace.

677
01:19:33,850 --> 01:19:35,770
- Goodbye.
- Wait. Wait.

678
01:19:38,610 --> 01:19:41,030
David Webb.
That's your real name.

679
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:46,870
<i>You were born 4/15/71 in Nixa, Missouri.</i>

680
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:50,660
<i>Why don't you come in
and we'll talk about it?</i>

681
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:53,790
Something is very wrong here.

682
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,420
Bourne?

683
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:00,920
Get some rest, Pam.

684
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:02,590
<i>You look tired.</i>

685
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,970
He's looking right at her.

686
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:11,060
People, listen up!

687
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,060
This is a national security emergency.

688
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:15,060
We have an imminent threat.

689
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:16,810
I'm going out there.

690
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:19,230
If I show myself, he'll find me.

691
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:22,190
Jason Bourne is alive
and is at large in New York City,

692
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,650
and, we believe,
within 1,000 yards of this building.

693
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:27,370
I want an immediate 12-block lockdown
of the area.

694
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:29,030
Send a flash message to Langley.

695
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,410
Prep for local backup assistance.

696
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:35,000
Landy just left the building!

697
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,500
Stay with her phone.

698
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:56,560
She's using her cell.
There's an incoming text.

699
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:57,850
- Get it.
- Working on it, sir.

700
01:20:57,940 --> 01:20:59,020
How many do we have on Landy?

701
01:20:59,110 --> 01:21:00,230
Six men. More on the way.

702
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:03,570
I've got it, sir!
Coming up on the screen now.

703
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:10,580
Anybody not on Landy
goes directly to Tudor City.

704
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:13,120
Get the vehicles.
We're going mobile.

705
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:16,160
- Team Two. Team Two.
- All teams, call in.

706
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:53,950
178th.

707
01:21:58,370 --> 01:22:00,120
There's only one way out of there.
Why would he do that?

708
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:01,500
He's trapping himself.

709
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:03,340
It's a bad place to meet.
It's too exposed.

710
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:05,340
He wouldn't have chosen it
if he didn't have a reason.

711
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:13,430
Subject is en route.

712
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:15,430
<i>Roof 43, let me know
when you have visual.</i>

713
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,310
<i>Roof 43, standing by.</i>

714
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:25,020
Standing by.

715
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:28,490
Okay, folks, here we go.
Box 200 meters.

716
01:22:28,570 --> 01:22:29,860
Visual on leader.

717
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:32,280
<i>43 ground in position.</i>

718
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:35,490
As soon as you have eyes on Landy,
I wanna know.

719
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:51,220
Okay, here we go.

720
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:53,090
Copy that. I see her.

721
01:23:05,190 --> 01:23:07,150
Any sign of Bourne?

722
01:23:07,230 --> 01:23:08,480
<i>Negative.</i>

723
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:11,280
<i>No sign of target.</i>

724
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:24,040
Noah Vosen.

725
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:26,590
This is Jason Bourne.

726
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,630
I was wondering when you were going
to make this call.

727
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:32,260
<i>How did you get this number?</i>

728
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:36,220
You didn't actually think I was
coming to Tudor City, did you?

729
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:39,720
No, I guess not.

730
01:23:39,810 --> 01:23:41,640
But if it's me you want to talk to,

731
01:23:41,730 --> 01:23:44,190
perhaps we can arrange a meet.

732
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:46,020
Where are you now?

733
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:48,940
I'm sitting in my office.

734
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:51,820
I doubt that.

735
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,200
And why would you doubt that?

736
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:55,660
If you were
in your office right now,

737
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:58,790
we'd be having this conversation
face to face.

738
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:07,210
<i>Noah Vosen.</i>

739
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:11,970
This is a code ten abort.

740
01:24:12,050 --> 01:24:14,510
I want everyone back in the vehicles.
This is a code ten abort.

741
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:16,340
Let's go! Let's go!

742
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:39,910
Yeah?

743
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:41,290
Wills, check my office.

744
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:47,000
Damn it!

745
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:48,710
<i>What's going on?</i>

746
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:54,220
We need building security up here.

747
01:24:55,470 --> 01:24:57,340
- <i>He's got everything.</i>
- God damn it!

748
01:24:57,430 --> 01:24:59,510
All right, set a four-block perimeter
around the building.

749
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:00,850
Somebody give me a visual.

750
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:02,350
I want the entire building searched.

751
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:05,730
Every room, every hallway, every closet,
every goddamn air duct.

752
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:07,810
You understand? I want him found!

753
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,730
What just happened?

754
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:16,280
Bourne just broke into CRI.
He got into Vosen's safe.

755
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:19,450
Where to?

756
01:25:19,530 --> 01:25:21,870
415 East 71st Street.

757
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:25,750
Four-fifteen-seventy-one?
Jesus, Pam.

758
01:25:51,310 --> 01:25:52,940
Target in sight.

759
01:25:57,740 --> 01:25:59,320
North on Eighth.

760
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:07,870
He's headed east in the Port Authority.

761
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:09,920
All agents have shoot-on-sight authorization.

762
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,110
Right there!

763
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:20,360
- Sir, he drove off the roof.
- What?

764
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,320
He drove off the roof!

765
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:25,870
He's on foot.
He's running.

766
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:37,750
Police! Freeze!

767
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,590
Put your hands in the air!

768
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:50,850
Call for backup!

769
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:18,090
Sir, sir, take a look at this!
Bourne's birthday, sir.

770
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:19,500
- What about it?
- Check that out.

771
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:23,970
Sir, Landy told Bourne
that his birthday was 4/15/71.

772
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:26,640
Oh, my God. It's a code.

773
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,930
Everything stops. Everything stops!
Listen up!

774
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:32,810
4/15/71.
New assignment, numbers.

775
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:34,770
- What does it mean?
- Give me encryption codes!

776
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:37,400
Sir, if you plug them in as variables
of longitude and latitude

777
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:39,230
you get Cameroon.

778
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:42,280
41571 is the zip code
for Varney, Kentucky.

779
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:46,360
What date did she give him?

780
01:28:46,450 --> 01:28:49,080
<i>4/15/71.</i>

781
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:50,910
I don't believe it.

782
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:55,120
SRD is at 415 East 71st Street.

783
01:28:55,210 --> 01:28:56,920
<i>She just gave him the training facility.</i>

784
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,130
Oh, Christ.

785
01:28:58,170 --> 01:29:00,630
Bring all the teams in behind us.

786
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:00,790
Hurry up! Somebody call 911!

787
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:01,870
Help him!

788
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:38,790
<i>The asset lost Bourne.
We lost him.</i>

789
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:49,050
- Hello?
- Albert, it's Vosen.

790
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:54,010
Bourne knows everything
and he's on his way to you right now.

791
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:56,760
He's coming home, Noah.

792
01:31:56,850 --> 01:31:58,680
<i>How long do I have?</i>

793
01:31:58,770 --> 01:31:59,970
<i>I don't know.</i>

794
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:02,390
Just get the hell out of there.

795
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:04,440
No, I'm gonna stay.

796
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:08,070
<i>He'll head for the training wing.
That's what he knows.</i>

797
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:12,150
I'll keep him in play
till you get there.

798
01:33:03,330 --> 01:33:05,370
They'll kill you for giving me this.

799
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:08,330
4/15/71 isn't much of a code.

800
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:11,170
My guess is Vosen
is on his way already.

801
01:33:12,130 --> 01:33:13,970
Why'd you do it?

802
01:33:14,050 --> 01:33:16,130
Because this isn't
what I signed up for,

803
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:18,510
what they did to you, Blackbriar.

804
01:33:18,970 --> 01:33:20,470
This isn't us.

805
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:26,230
Then do something about it.
Everything you need is in there.

806
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,860
Everything.

807
01:33:33,230 --> 01:33:36,530
David. Why don't you come in with me?

808
01:33:36,570 --> 01:33:38,070
It'll be better
if we do this together.

809
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:39,530
No.

810
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:43,750
This is where it started for me.

811
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:46,000
This is where it ends.

812
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:00,640
That's Landy.

813
01:34:06,940 --> 01:34:09,770
<i>Mandy Aaron, dial extension 200, please.</i>

814
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:12,440
<i>Mandy Aaron, dial extension 200.</i>

815
01:34:13,070 --> 01:34:14,530
All right, lock this building down.

816
01:34:14,610 --> 01:34:17,110
Set a secure perimeter of one block.

817
01:34:23,450 --> 01:34:26,870
Hello. This is Pamela Landy.
I have to send a classified document.

818
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,790
Get a team to SRD after Bourne.

819
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:30,670
And put someone in every
public area of this hospital.

820
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:33,750
Okay. Elevator shafts,
service entrances, go!

821
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:41,720
Damn it! South bay! Go!

822
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:44,100
Gentlemen, this is a priority one situation!

823
01:34:44,140 --> 01:34:45,560
You will give us your full cooperation.

824
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:47,770
Give me playback for the entire building
for the last three minutes.

825
01:34:47,850 --> 01:34:48,890
Yes, sir.

826
01:35:00,660 --> 01:35:02,120
Move! Move!

827
01:35:07,790 --> 01:35:09,870
This one, here!
Where is this?

828
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:11,080
First floor.

829
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:13,250
I'll take Landy on my own.

830
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:51,290
You better get yourself a good lawyer.

831
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:08,470
<i>A republic lives on the knife's edge.</i>

832
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:20,320
<i>When we are finished with you,
you will no longer be David Webb.</i>

833
01:36:22,780 --> 01:36:25,660
<i>You may not even remember who he was.</i>

834
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:31,250
<i>You know why we're treating you
like this?</i>

835
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:34,000
Hello, Jason.

836
01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:40,420
I believe you've been
having some problems.

837
01:36:40,510 --> 01:36:42,170
Put the gun down.

838
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:46,220
I wouldn't be here
if I didn't want to talk.

839
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:51,770
I've spent three years running.

840
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:55,690
Three years trying to find out who I am.

841
01:36:55,770 --> 01:36:58,690
You've still not got it all back,
have you?

842
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:01,690
Still not filled in the pieces.

843
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:03,400
It was always you.

844
01:37:05,490 --> 01:37:07,280
I'm unarmed, Jason.

845
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:10,410
Why me? Why did you pick me?

846
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:14,410
Your really don't remember, do you?

847
01:37:16,710 --> 01:37:19,750
We didn't pick you.
You picked us.

848
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:24,510
You volunteered.

849
01:37:26,430 --> 01:37:27,800
Right here.

850
01:37:30,850 --> 01:37:32,390
Even after you were warned.

851
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:44,320
<i>Captain Webb.</i>

852
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:45,650
<i>Good morning, Captain.</i>

853
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:53,240
You came in here.

854
01:37:55,330 --> 01:37:58,170
You didn't even blink, Jason.

855
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:05,340
You just handed me these.

856
01:38:12,140 --> 01:38:14,680
<i>Has everything been explained to you?</i>

857
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:17,810
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

858
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,690
You said you wanted to serve.

859
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:27,450
<i>Your missions will save American lives.</i>

860
01:38:27,530 --> 01:38:29,360
<i>I understand, sir.</i>

861
01:38:32,030 --> 01:38:34,660
You said I'd be saving American lives.

862
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:36,870
You were.

863
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:39,120
I was killing for you.

864
01:38:41,330 --> 01:38:42,750
For them.

865
01:38:43,630 --> 01:38:48,300
You knew exactly what it meant for you
if you chose to stay.

866
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:52,800
<i>When we are finished with you,
you will no longer be David Webb.</i>

867
01:38:52,890 --> 01:38:55,100
<i>I'll be whoever you need me to be, sir.</i>

868
01:38:57,020 --> 01:38:59,640
You can't outrun what you did, Jason.

869
01:39:00,270 --> 01:39:02,860
You made yourself into who you are.

870
01:39:03,730 --> 01:39:06,690
Eventually you're gonna have
to face the fact

871
01:39:06,730 --> 01:39:11,360
you chose right here
to become Jason Bourne.

872
01:39:17,870 --> 01:39:20,330
<i>You haven't slept for a long time.</i>

873
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:27,800
<i>Have you made a decision?</i>

874
01:39:32,390 --> 01:39:34,050
<i>This can't go on.</i>

875
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,600
<i>You have to decide.</i>

876
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:41,520
<i>Who is he?</i>

877
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:43,650
<i>We've been through that.</i>

878
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:48,780
<i>What did he do?</i>

879
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:51,200
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

880
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:07,050
<i>You came to us.</i>

881
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:11,670
<i>You volunteered.</i>

882
01:40:12,510 --> 01:40:15,680
<i>You said you'd do anything it takes to</i>

883
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:18,510
<i>save American lives.</i>

884
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:21,310
<i>You're not a liar, are you?</i>

885
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:24,810
<i>Or too weak</i>

886
01:40:25,690 --> 01:40:27,520
<i>to see this through?</i>

887
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:30,690
<i>This is it.</i>

888
01:40:31,860 --> 01:40:34,660
<i>Let go of David Webb.</i>

889
01:40:40,370 --> 01:40:44,080
<i>Really give yourself to this program.</i>

890
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:11,230
<i>You're no longer</i>

891
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:13,700
<i>David Webb.</i>

892
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:19,200
<i>From now on,
you'll be known as Jason Bourne.</i>

893
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:23,120
<i>Welcome to the program.</i>

894
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:38,140
Do you remember now?

895
01:41:46,940 --> 01:41:48,400
I remember.

896
01:41:50,650 --> 01:41:52,570
I remember everything.

897
01:41:54,110 --> 01:41:56,280
I'm no longer Jason Bourne.

898
01:41:57,990 --> 01:42:00,240
So now you're gonna kill me.

899
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:02,660
No.

900
01:42:04,410 --> 01:42:08,540
You don't deserve the star
they'd give you on the wall at Langley.

901
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:25,020
<i>He's headed for the roof!</i>

902
01:43:10,190 --> 01:43:12,400
Why didn't you take the shot?

903
01:43:21,410 --> 01:43:24,530
Do you even know
why you're supposed to kill me?

904
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:35,340
Look at us.

905
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:40,720
Look at what they make you give.

906
01:44:31,850 --> 01:44:33,390
Good morning, senators.

907
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:38,440
If I may, I'd like to begin
by making a statement for the record.

908
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:45,870
<i>The file indicates that Ezra Kramer
authorized six illegal--</i>

909
01:44:45,950 --> 01:44:46,990
<i>The President convened</i>

910
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:48,870
<i>an emergency cabinet meeting today</i>

911
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:50,330
<i>to discuss the growing scandal</i>

912
01:44:50,410 --> 01:44:53,160
<i>over an alleged government
assassination program,</i>

913
01:44:53,250 --> 01:44:55,250
<i>code-named "Blackbriar".</i>

914
01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:58,380
<i>CIA Director Ezra Kramer
is under criminal investigation</i>

915
01:44:58,540 --> 01:45:00,420
<i>for authorizing the program,</i>

916
01:45:00,510 --> 01:45:04,430
<i>which in several cases
may have even targeted US citizens.</i>

917
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:11,220
<i>Two agency officials
have already been arrested.</i>

918
01:45:11,310 --> 01:45:15,060
<i>Dr. Albert Hirsch,
the alleged mastermind of program</i>

919
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:19,650
<i>and CIA Deputy Director Noah Vosen,
the program's operational chief.</i>

920

<i>Meanwhile, mystery surrounds
the fate of David Webb,</i>

921
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:27,410
<i>also known as Jason Bourne,</i>

922
01:45:27,490 --> 01:45:30,450
<i>the source behind the exposure
of the Blackbriar program.</i>

923
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:33,960
<i>It's been reported that Webb was shot
and fell from a Manhattan rooftop</i>

924
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:36,750
<i>into the East River
ten stories below.</i>

925

<i>However, after a three-day search,</i>

926

<i>Webb's body has yet to be found.</i>
