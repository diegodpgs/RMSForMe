1
00:01:03,686 --> 00:01:06,052
<i>Ah, there it is. My house.</i>

2
00:01:06,956 --> 00:01:10,357
<i>And good old Cleveland Street.
How could I ever forget it?</i>

3
00:01:11,026 --> 00:01:13,927
<i>And there I am,
with that dumb round face and...</i>

4
00:01:13,996 --> 00:01:15,827
<i>that stupid stocking cap.</i>

5
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:19,634
<i>But no matter. Christmas was on its way.</i>

6
00:01:19,935 --> 00:01:22,733
<i>Lovely, glorious, beautiful Christmas...</i>

7
00:01:23,072 --> 00:01:25,666
<i>around which the entire kid year revolved.</i>

8
00:01:49,498 --> 00:01:53,298
<i>Downtown Hohman was prepared
for its yearly bacchanalia of...</i>

9
00:01:53,435 --> 00:01:56,029
<i>peace on earth and good will to men.</i>

10
00:02:45,988 --> 00:02:49,685
<i>Higbees' corner window
was traditionally a high-water mark...</i>

11
00:02:49,758 --> 00:02:51,749
<i>of the pre-Christmas season.</i>

12
00:02:53,028 --> 00:02:57,328
<i>First nighters, packed earmuff to earmuff,
jostled in wonderment...</i>

13
00:02:57,866 --> 00:03:01,233
<i>before a golden tinkling display...</i>

14
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,698
<i>of mechanized, electronic joy.</i>

15
00:03:49,284 --> 00:03:51,081
<i>Wow, there it is.</i>

16
00:03:52,154 --> 00:03:54,588
<i>The holy grail of Christmas gifts.</i>

17
00:03:54,656 --> 00:03:57,557
<i>The Red Ryder 200-shot range model...</i>

18
00:03:57,626 --> 00:03:58,786
<i>air rifle.</i>

19
00:03:59,695 --> 00:04:01,663
<i>And there he is.</i>

20
00:04:02,164 --> 00:04:03,654
<i>Red Ryder himself.</i>

21
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:08,399
<i>In his hand was the knurled stock
of as coolly deadly-looking...</i>

22
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,463
<i>a piece of weaponry
as ever I had laid eyes on.</i>

23
00:04:17,179 --> 00:04:21,172
<i>For weeks, I had been scheming
to get my mitts on one of these...</i>

24
00:04:21,283 --> 00:04:23,979
<i>fearsome blue-steel beauties.</i>

25
00:04:24,186 --> 00:04:28,418
<i>My fevered brain seethed
with the effort of trying to come up with...</i>

26
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,358
<i>the infinitely subtle devices
necessary to implant...</i>

27
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:35,625
<i>the Red Ryder range model
air rifle indelibly...</i>

28
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:38,297
<i>into my parents' subconscious.</i>

29
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:39,534
Ralphie!

30
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:41,036
Randy!

31
00:04:41,203 --> 00:04:43,034
Down here in two minutes!

32
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,407
And I mean two minutes!

33
00:04:45,474 --> 00:04:47,942
Come on, Ralphie. I got here first!

34
00:04:54,216 --> 00:04:55,581
Cut it out.

35
00:05:21,343 --> 00:05:24,574
<i>My mother, grabbing for her copy
of Look magazine...</i>

36
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,280
<i>would find herself cleverly trapped
into reading a Red Ryder sales pitch.</i>

37
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:34,521
They traded Bullfrog. I don't believe it.

38
00:05:35,157 --> 00:05:36,317
What's that?

39
00:05:36,825 --> 00:05:39,623
Well, for Christ's sake,
the Sox traded Bullfrog...

40
00:05:39,695 --> 00:05:41,822
the only player they've got,
for Shottenhoffer.

41
00:05:41,964 --> 00:05:44,524
"Four Eyes" Shottenhoffer,
a utility infielder.

42
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:47,758
Got a whole goddamned team
of utility infielders.

43
00:05:47,836 --> 00:05:49,235
That's nice.

44
00:05:49,404 --> 00:05:51,304
Ralphie, on the double!

45
00:05:52,941 --> 00:05:55,171
Did you hear about this guy
who swallowed a yo-yo?

46
00:05:55,277 --> 00:05:57,939
- Swallowed a yo-yo?
- On a bet.

47
00:05:58,013 --> 00:06:00,538
Some clodhopper down in Griffith, Indiana.

48
00:06:01,884 --> 00:06:04,614
They write the silliest things
in the newspapers.

49
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,648
What do you mean, silly?
I mean that's real news.

50
00:06:07,756 --> 00:06:09,849
That's not like that politics slop.

51
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,623
What is the name
of the Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?

52
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:18,128
Victor. His name is Victor.

53
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:21,526
- How the hell did you know that?
- Everybody knows that.

54
00:06:23,205 --> 00:06:25,833
That's another one of your silly puzzles?

55
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,373
Yeah, it's another one of our silly puzzles.

56
00:06:28,443 --> 00:06:31,810
Could be worth $50,000.

57
00:06:32,948 --> 00:06:34,711
What kind is it this time?

58
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,278
Name the great characters
in American literature.

59
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:42,512
Victor?
The Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?

60
00:06:42,758 --> 00:06:46,023
<i>Meanwhile, I struggled
for exactly the right BB gun hint.</i>

61
00:06:46,094 --> 00:06:47,527
<i>It had to be firm, but subtle.</i>

62
00:06:47,763 --> 00:06:50,789
Flick says he saw some grizzly bears
near Pulaski's candy store.

63
00:06:56,705 --> 00:07:00,539
<i>They looked at me as if
I had lobsters crawling out of my ears.</i>

64
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,376
<i>I could tell that I was in imminent danger
of over-playing my hand.</i>

65
00:07:06,215 --> 00:07:08,115
<i>Casually, I switched tactics.</i>

66
00:07:08,784 --> 00:07:09,876
Hey, Dad!

67
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:14,451
I'll bet you'll never guess
what I got you for Christmas.

68
00:07:15,991 --> 00:07:17,322
A new furnace.

69
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:20,719
That's a good one, Dad.

70
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,361
<i>My old man was one
of the most feared furnace-fighters...</i>

71
00:07:25,434 --> 00:07:27,197
<i>in northern Indiana.</i>

72
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:30,299
Hurry up,
you're going to be late for school.

73
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:32,972
Yeah. I'm running late already.

74
00:07:33,242 --> 00:07:34,766
<i>Round one was over.</i>

75
00:07:35,644 --> 00:07:36,770
<i>Parents, one.</i>

76
00:07:36,912 --> 00:07:37,970
<i>Kids, zip.</i>

77
00:07:39,514 --> 00:07:42,381
<i>I could feel the Christmas noose
beginning to tighten.</i>

78
00:07:42,718 --> 00:07:45,687
<i>Maybe what happened next
was inevitable.</i>

79
00:07:45,754 --> 00:07:48,348
Ralphie, what would you like
for Christmas?

80
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,685
<i>Horrified, I heard myself blurt it out.</i>

81
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:54,819
I want an official Red Ryder carbine action
200-shot range model air rifle.

82
00:07:56,064 --> 00:07:57,998
No. Shoot your eye out.

83
00:07:58,066 --> 00:08:01,832
<i>Oh, no! It was
the classic mother-BB gun block.</i>

84
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:03,795
<i>"You'll shoot your eye out."</i>

85
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:07,668
<i>That deadly phrase uttered
many times before by hundreds...</i>

86
00:08:07,776 --> 00:08:09,744
<i>of mothers was not surmountable...</i>

87
00:08:09,811 --> 00:08:11,836
<i>by any means known to kid-dom.</i>

88
00:08:12,014 --> 00:08:15,814
<i>But such was my mania,
my desire for a Red Ryder carbine...</i>

89
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:19,182
<i>that I immediately began
to rebuild the dike.</i>

90
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:23,383
I was just kidding.
Even though Flick is getting one.

91
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:25,492
I'd just like some Tinkertoys.

92
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,120
<i>I couldn't believe my own ears.
Tinkertoys?</i>

93
00:08:28,263 --> 00:08:29,662
<i>She'd never buy it.</i>

94
00:08:30,098 --> 00:08:31,929
BB guns are dangerous.

95
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,592
I don't want anyone shooting his eye out.

96
00:08:39,474 --> 00:08:43,308
Randy, will you eat?
There are starving people in China.

97
00:08:52,754 --> 00:08:55,416
<i>Mothers know nothing
about creeping marauders...</i>

98
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,581
<i>burrowing through the snow
toward the kitchen...</i>

99
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:01,186
<i>where only you, and you alone,
stand between your tiny...</i>

100
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:04,093
<i>huddled family and insensate evil.</i>

101
00:09:11,973 --> 00:09:15,204
Save us, Ralphie!
I just knew those bad guys...

102
00:09:15,277 --> 00:09:17,711
would be coming for us in the end!

103
00:09:18,613 --> 00:09:21,844
Don't worry, Dad.
As long as I got Ol' Blue...

104
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:27,954
What've we got here, folks?

105
00:09:28,023 --> 00:09:30,958
Well, we figure it's Black Bart, Ralph.

106
00:09:31,326 --> 00:09:33,590
Well, just me and my trusty old...

107
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,392
Red Ryder carbine-action
200-shot range model air rifle.

108
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:40,459
Lucky I've got a compass in the stock.

109
00:09:40,702 --> 00:09:42,932
Well, I think I better have a look here.

110
00:09:56,885 --> 00:09:58,045
Oh, no!

111
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,818
It's Ol' Blue!

112
00:10:01,123 --> 00:10:02,522
Oh, no!

113
00:10:03,325 --> 00:10:04,917
Cheese it, boys!

114
00:10:17,005 --> 00:10:20,702
There's another one!
He's a dead-eye, ain't he?

115
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,474
Okay, Ralphie!

116
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:32,645
You win this time, but we'll be back!

117
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:39,058
<i>Adiós, Bart.</i>

118
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:43,424
But if you do come back,
you'll be pushing up daisies!

119
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,837
And don't you forget it!

120
00:10:49,905 --> 00:10:51,463
<i>Well, son, you saved us!</i>

121
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,566
<i>We were goners for sure!
And you saved us!</i>

122
00:11:03,051 --> 00:11:04,416
Oldsmobile!

123
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,344
A pile of junk!

124
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:09,784
That goddamned Olds is froze up again!

125
00:11:09,858 --> 00:11:14,659
<i>Some men are Baptists, others Catholics.
My father was an Oldsmobile man.</i>

126
00:11:14,963 --> 00:11:19,024
That son of a bitch would freeze up
in the middle of summer on the Equator!

127
00:11:19,401 --> 00:11:22,063
- Little pitchers...
- Hold it!

128
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,974
It's a clinker!

129
00:11:38,787 --> 00:11:40,914
That blasted, stupid furnace.

130
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:42,320
Dadgummit!

131
00:11:47,562 --> 00:11:49,052
Damn skates!

132
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:54,162
For Christ's sake,
open up the damper, will you?

133
00:11:54,236 --> 00:11:56,932
Who the hell turned it
all the way down again?

134
00:11:57,906 --> 00:11:58,930
Blasted!

135
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:13,316
<i>In the heat of battle,
my father wove a tapestry of obscenity...</i>

136
00:12:13,555 --> 00:12:17,924
<i>that as far as we know is still hanging
in space over Lake Michigan.</i>

137
00:12:29,337 --> 00:12:31,737
<i>Preparing to go to school
was like getting ready...</i>

138
00:12:31,806 --> 00:12:34,274
<i>for extended deep-sea diving.</i>

139
00:12:53,762 --> 00:12:57,664
- Come on, Mom, we're going to be late!
- Just wait, Ralph!

140
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,460
<i>My kid brother looked like
a tick about to pop.</i>

141
00:13:01,536 --> 00:13:02,332
What?

142
00:13:03,538 --> 00:13:04,368
What is it?

143
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,001
What is it?

144
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:14,278
- What is it?
- I can't put my arms down!

145
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,420
Well, put your arms down
when you get to school.

146
00:13:58,393 --> 00:13:59,883
Hey, Flick! Wait up.

147
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:01,256
Wait up!

148
00:14:01,963 --> 00:14:03,021
So what are you doing?

149
00:14:03,264 --> 00:14:05,698
What does it look like I'm doing?
Picking goobers?

150
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:09,335
Hey, listen, smart ass.
I asked my old man about sticking...

151
00:14:09,404 --> 00:14:11,804
your tongue to metal light poles
in winter...

152
00:14:11,873 --> 00:14:15,274
and he says it will freeze right to the pole
just like I told you.

153
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,534
Baloney.

154
00:14:16,611 --> 00:14:18,579
What would your old man know
about anything?

155
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:20,945
He knows because he once saw a guy
stick his tongue...

156
00:14:21,016 --> 00:14:24,611
to a railroad track on a bet
and the fire department had to come...

157
00:14:24,686 --> 00:14:28,554
to get the guy's tongue off the track
because he couldn't get it off.

158
00:14:28,623 --> 00:14:30,386
Come on, guys, wait up!

159
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,948
Come on, guys!

160
00:14:32,427 --> 00:14:34,657
Come on, guys, wait up!

161
00:14:39,901 --> 00:14:41,300
I can't get up!

162
00:14:42,604 --> 00:14:44,367
I can't get up!

163
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:45,371
Help!

164
00:14:46,808 --> 00:14:49,072
I can't get out! Help me!

165
00:14:50,478 --> 00:14:52,139
Come on, Flick, wait up for me.

166
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:54,044
I can't get up!

167
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,315
Come on.

168
00:14:58,386 --> 00:15:00,718
Get up. Sit up. Come on.

169
00:15:02,557 --> 00:15:03,990
You're okay. Come on, let's go.

170
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:05,390
Come on, you're all right!

171
00:15:14,636 --> 00:15:15,603
Miss Shields!

172
00:15:16,604 --> 00:15:17,662
All right, everyone...

173
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:19,400
take your seats, please.

174
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:29,246
Good morning, class.

175
00:15:29,317 --> 00:15:32,650
Good morning, Miss Shields.

176
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:09,889
Open your books to Page 32.

177
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,825
And as you'll remember, Silas Marner...

178
00:16:23,304 --> 00:16:25,932
You're full of beans and so's your old man.

179
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:29,338
- Says who?
- Says me.

180
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,310
Well, I double-dare you.

181
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:33,973
<i>The exact exchange and nuance...</i>

182
00:16:34,115 --> 00:16:37,573
<i>of phrase in this ritual is very important.</i>

183
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:40,379
Are you kidding?
Stick my tongue to that stupid pole?

184
00:16:40,488 --> 00:16:41,455
That's dumb.

185
00:16:41,523 --> 00:16:43,491
That's 'cause you know it will stick!

186
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:45,183
You're full of it.

187
00:16:45,727 --> 00:16:47,854
Well, I double dog-dare you!

188
00:16:48,396 --> 00:16:51,627
<i>Now it was serious. A double dog-dare.</i>

189
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:54,294
<i>What else was left but a "triple-dare you"?</i>

190
00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:56,927
<i>And finally,
the coup de grâce of all dares...</i>

191
00:16:57,005 --> 00:16:59,405
<i>the sinister triple dog-dare!</i>

192
00:17:00,008 --> 00:17:02,568
I triple dog-dare you!

193
00:17:03,578 --> 00:17:06,046
<i>Schwartz created
a slight breach of etiquette...</i>

194
00:17:06,147 --> 00:17:09,776
<i>by skipping the triple-dare
and going right for the throat.</i>

195
00:17:09,851 --> 00:17:11,182
All right, all right.

196
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:24,228
- Go on, smart ass, and do it!
- I'm going!

197
00:17:24,899 --> 00:17:28,960
<i>Flick's spine stiffened,
his lips curled in a defiant sneer.</i>

198
00:17:29,504 --> 00:17:31,472
<i>There was no going back now.</i>

199
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:36,101
This is nothing.

200
00:17:40,481 --> 00:17:42,108
Stuck? Stuck!

201
00:17:42,183 --> 00:17:44,276
Stuck! Stuck!

202
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:51,283
Jeez!

203
00:17:51,426 --> 00:17:52,859
It really works!

204
00:17:52,927 --> 00:17:54,360
Look at him!

205
00:18:04,706 --> 00:18:06,105
Ralphie, come back!

206
00:18:06,174 --> 00:18:09,575
- Come back! Don't leave me! Come back!
- But the bell rang!

207
00:18:09,711 --> 00:18:13,203
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know! The bell rang!

208
00:18:23,391 --> 00:18:24,653
Where's Flick?

209
00:18:26,394 --> 00:18:27,725
Has anyone seen Flick?

210
00:18:27,896 --> 00:18:29,625
<i>Flick? Flick who?</i>

211
00:18:29,697 --> 00:18:31,824
He was at recess, wasn't he?

212
00:18:33,468 --> 00:18:35,959
Ralphie, do you know where Flick is?

213
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:45,010
I said has anyone seen Flick?

214
00:18:47,382 --> 00:18:49,009
Yes, Esther Jane?

215
00:18:55,089 --> 00:18:56,681
Oh, my God!

216
00:19:17,545 --> 00:19:20,036
Holy cow, it's the fire department!

217
00:19:27,155 --> 00:19:28,884
Wow, it's the cops!

218
00:20:21,376 --> 00:20:25,403
Now, I know that some of you
put Flick up to this.

219
00:20:28,116 --> 00:20:30,676
But, he has refused to say who.

220
00:20:33,287 --> 00:20:35,915
But those who did it know their blame.

221
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:41,119
And I'm sure the guilt you feel...

222
00:20:41,362 --> 00:20:45,321
is far worse than any punishment
you might receive.

223
00:20:49,637 --> 00:20:51,764
Now, don't you feel terrible?

224
00:20:52,874 --> 00:20:55,707
Don't you feel remorse
for what you have done?

225
00:20:58,112 --> 00:21:00,876
That's all I'm going to say
about poor Flick.

226
00:21:03,918 --> 00:21:07,376
<i>Adults love to say things like that.
But kids know better.</i>

227
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:11,289
<i>We knew darn well
it was always better not to get caught.</i>

228
00:21:11,392 --> 00:21:14,657
Now, boys and girls,
I'm going to give you an assignment.

229
00:21:15,863 --> 00:21:17,558
I want you to write...

230
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:19,827
a theme.

231
00:21:23,438 --> 00:21:25,736
"What I want for Christmas."

232
00:21:27,108 --> 00:21:28,598
<i>The clouds lifted.</i>

233
00:21:29,143 --> 00:21:31,543
And I want it handed in
tomorrow morning...

234
00:21:31,612 --> 00:21:34,706
<i>I saw a faint gleam of light
at the other end of...</i>

235
00:21:34,782 --> 00:21:36,647
<i>the black cave of doom.</i>

236
00:21:36,717 --> 00:21:40,744
<i>I knew that when Miss Shields
read my magnificent, eloquent theme...</i>

237
00:21:40,822 --> 00:21:43,620
<i>that she would sympathize
with my plight...</i>

238
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:46,888
<i>and everything would work out, somehow.</i>

239
00:22:02,243 --> 00:22:04,711
Boy, did you see how it stuck?

240
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,510
- Did it hurt, Flick?
- No. I never felt a thing.

241
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,210
It just caught me off-guard.

242
00:22:10,284 --> 00:22:12,912
- You sure were bawling.
- I never bawled!

243
00:22:13,054 --> 00:22:14,521
Baloney.

244
00:22:27,668 --> 00:22:29,226
Scut Farkus!

245
00:22:29,837 --> 00:22:33,432
<i>Scut Farkus! What a rotten name.
We were trapped.</i>

246
00:22:33,508 --> 00:22:36,409
<i>There he stood, between us and the alley.</i>

247
00:22:36,477 --> 00:22:39,537
<i>Scut Farkus, staring out at us
with his yellow eyes.</i>

248
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:43,112
<i>He had yellow eyes!
So help me God, yellow eyes.</i>

249
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:01,329
<i>Grover Dill, Farkus' crummy little toady.</i>

250
00:23:01,402 --> 00:23:02,892
<i>Mean. Rotten.</i>

251
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:05,370
<i>His lips curled over his green teeth.</i>

252
00:23:05,973 --> 00:23:07,873
<i>Randy lay there like a slug.</i>

253
00:23:07,942 --> 00:23:10,001
<i>It was his only defense.</i>

254
00:23:14,849 --> 00:23:16,976
- Say "uncle."
- Uncle!

255
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:25,853
Louder!

256
00:23:27,728 --> 00:23:30,697
<i>In our world, you were
either a bully, a toady...</i>

257
00:23:30,765 --> 00:23:33,427
<i>or one of the nameless rabble of victims.</i>

258
00:23:33,568 --> 00:23:34,694
All right.

259
00:23:34,902 --> 00:23:36,460
Who's next?

260
00:23:59,894 --> 00:24:03,625
<i>In the jungles of kid-dom,
the mind switches gears rapidly.</i>

261
00:24:03,965 --> 00:24:06,525
<i>Weeks ago I had sent away
for my Little Orphan Annie...</i>

262
00:24:06,601 --> 00:24:08,626
<i>secret society decoder pen.</i>

263
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,870
<i>Oh, skunked again.</i>

264
00:24:10,938 --> 00:24:13,566
<i>No matter. Today I had serious work to do.</i>

265
00:24:14,242 --> 00:24:16,369
"What I want for Christmas."

266
00:24:16,444 --> 00:24:19,572
"What I want is a Red Ryder BB gun
with a compass in the stock...

267
00:24:19,647 --> 00:24:21,512
"and this thing which tells time."

268
00:24:21,682 --> 00:24:23,081
Wow, that's great.

269
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,176
"I think that everybody should have
a Red Ryder BB gun.

270
00:24:26,287 --> 00:24:28,152
"They're very good for Christmas.

271
00:24:28,756 --> 00:24:32,283
"I don't think that a football's
a very good Christmas present."

272
00:24:33,094 --> 00:24:36,586
<i>Oh, rarely had the words poured
from my penny pencil...</i>

273
00:24:36,664 --> 00:24:38,461
<i>with such feverish fluidity.</i>

274
00:24:43,838 --> 00:24:45,430
I've won! I've won!

275
00:24:56,651 --> 00:24:57,879
<i>The Bumpus hounds.</i>

276
00:24:59,186 --> 00:25:01,848
<i>Our hillbilly neighbors, the Bumpuses,
had at least...</i>

277
00:25:01,922 --> 00:25:03,787
<i>785 smelly hound dogs.</i>

278
00:25:04,392 --> 00:25:08,158
<i>And they ignored every other human being
on earth but my old man.</i>

279
00:25:11,132 --> 00:25:12,429
I won!

280
00:25:13,668 --> 00:25:14,828
I won!

281
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,097
- What?
- A major prize!

282
00:25:18,172 --> 00:25:19,332
I won!

283
00:25:20,141 --> 00:25:23,167
Hey, look at that. Look at that.
A Western Union telegram.

284
00:25:23,244 --> 00:25:26,441
<i>Tonight, he's coming tonight.
Tonight. Hot damn, tonight!</i>

285
00:25:26,514 --> 00:25:28,175
What does this mean here?

286
00:25:28,282 --> 00:25:30,045
It means it's coming tonight!

287
00:25:30,117 --> 00:25:32,051
I called Ernie McClosky
at the freight depot.

288
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:34,952
He said the telegram was late,
the prize was already there...

289
00:25:35,022 --> 00:25:37,217
he was going to send it on tonight.

290
00:25:37,358 --> 00:25:40,725
Come on. Have a chew, fellas, on me.
It's my gift.

291
00:25:41,762 --> 00:25:46,096
You know, maybe it'll be one of those
Spanish adobe houses down in Coral...

292
00:25:50,404 --> 00:25:52,838
Serves you right, you smelly buggers.

293
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,101
Or it could be a bowling alley.

294
00:25:55,676 --> 00:25:57,871
A guy down in Terre Haute
won a bowling alley.

295
00:25:58,012 --> 00:26:00,742
How are they going to deliver
a bowling alley here tonight?

296
00:26:01,215 --> 00:26:04,582
They could send the deed,
for cripesake. I mean...

297
00:26:04,852 --> 00:26:08,219
I didn't expect they were going
to send the whole damn bowling alley.

298
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:11,122
Yeah, well. How about eating?
I'm starving to death.

299
00:26:11,392 --> 00:26:14,122
Getting rich is hard work, kid. Come on.

300
00:26:22,002 --> 00:26:24,197
<i>Every family has a kid who won't eat.</i>

301
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:28,599
<i>My kid brother had not eaten voluntarily
in over three years.</i>

302
00:26:30,411 --> 00:26:33,812
Oh, Randy, don't play
with your food, eat it!

303
00:26:36,717 --> 00:26:39,049
Starving people would be happy
to have that.

304
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,149
Can I have some more red cabbage?

305
00:26:48,095 --> 00:26:51,292
Stop playing with your food,
or I'll give you something to cry about.

306
00:26:51,732 --> 00:26:54,895
You better stop fooling around with it
and eat it or you'll be sorry.

307
00:27:00,274 --> 00:27:01,639
Can I please have some more?

308
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:05,236
<i>My mother had not had a hot meal
for herself in 15 years.</i>

309
00:27:07,415 --> 00:27:10,441
Meatloaf, double beetloaf.

310
00:27:11,051 --> 00:27:12,643
I hate meatloaf.

311
00:27:13,921 --> 00:27:16,412
All right. I'll get that kid to eat.

312
00:27:16,824 --> 00:27:18,587
Where's my screwdriver
and plumber's helper?

313
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:21,025
I'll open up his mouth and I'll shove it in.

314
00:27:21,295 --> 00:27:23,354
<i>My mother was more subtle.</i>

315
00:27:23,898 --> 00:27:26,162
How do the little piggies go?

316
00:27:26,901 --> 00:27:29,301
That's right. Oink, oink.

317
00:27:29,403 --> 00:27:32,702
Now, show me how the piggies eat.
This is your trough.

318
00:27:32,907 --> 00:27:35,774
Show me how the piggies eat.

319
00:27:36,177 --> 00:27:39,010
Be a good boy.
Show Mommy how the piggies eat.

320
00:28:07,775 --> 00:28:09,003
Oh, my.

321
00:28:09,477 --> 00:28:11,445
Mommy's little piggy.

322
00:28:31,832 --> 00:28:33,197
It's here.

323
00:28:40,908 --> 00:28:41,704
Are you Parker?

324
00:28:42,276 --> 00:28:44,369
- All right, sign here.
- Yeah. Well, what is it?

325
00:28:44,512 --> 00:28:45,706
I don't know.

326
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,438
What's in it?

327
00:28:47,515 --> 00:28:49,380
Here. Bring it in.

328
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,850
Okay, boys. Haul that on in here.
Move your tails.

329
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,411
Bring it right on in. Right here.
Bring it ahead. Straight ahead.

330
00:28:55,556 --> 00:28:56,614
That's right.

331
00:28:57,791 --> 00:28:58,883
Right.

332
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:01,757
Here, bring it right in, fellas.
That's it. Here we go.

333
00:29:01,862 --> 00:29:03,955
A little more. Little more.

334
00:29:04,031 --> 00:29:05,055
That's it.

335
00:29:07,835 --> 00:29:09,530
Watch the lady.

336
00:29:18,245 --> 00:29:19,940
Thanks a lot, guys.

337
00:29:20,014 --> 00:29:21,345
Merry Christmas.

338
00:29:21,415 --> 00:29:24,316
Get the crowbar and a hammer, Ralphie.
Go on.

339
00:29:25,886 --> 00:29:27,911
"Fra-gi-ley."

340
00:29:28,088 --> 00:29:31,455
- That must be Italian.
- I think that says "fragile."

341
00:29:31,692 --> 00:29:33,284
Oh, yeah.

342
00:29:34,628 --> 00:29:36,061
Here we go.

343
00:29:41,835 --> 00:29:44,065
They did a job on this, you know?

344
00:29:50,344 --> 00:29:52,642
No, here, Ralph, hold this.

345
00:29:59,053 --> 00:30:02,113
There could be anything in there!

346
00:30:02,189 --> 00:30:03,349
Jesus!

347
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,691
Maybe they forgot.

348
00:30:07,928 --> 00:30:10,761
It's in there. It's gotta be in there.

349
00:30:17,538 --> 00:30:19,904
- Would you look at that?
- What?

350
00:30:20,007 --> 00:30:22,339
Would you look at that?

351
00:30:24,945 --> 00:30:26,435
What is it?

352
00:30:27,181 --> 00:30:28,546
It's a leg!

353
00:30:29,016 --> 00:30:30,142
But what is it?

354
00:30:30,517 --> 00:30:32,485
Well, it's a leg.

355
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,219
You know, like in a statue.

356
00:30:34,788 --> 00:30:36,779
- Statue?
- Yeah, statue!

357
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:39,119
Yeah, statue!

358
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,850
Ralphie!

359
00:30:41,295 --> 00:30:45,231
<i>My mother was trying to insinuate herself
between us and the statue.</i>

360
00:30:45,466 --> 00:30:47,491
Holy smoke, would you...

361
00:30:47,568 --> 00:30:49,536
Do you know what this is?

362
00:30:49,603 --> 00:30:52,071
This is a lamp.

363
00:30:53,173 --> 00:30:54,970
<i>It was indeed a lamp.</i>

364
00:30:55,042 --> 00:30:57,909
Isn't that great? What a great lamp!

365
00:30:58,979 --> 00:31:00,776
I don't know.

366
00:31:01,715 --> 00:31:04,309
Here, hold it. Hold it. Here, go on.

367
00:31:04,718 --> 00:31:07,084
<i>The old man's eyes boggled...</i>

368
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,812
<i>overcome by art.</i>

369
00:31:09,923 --> 00:31:11,857
I know just the place for it.

370
00:31:11,925 --> 00:31:14,917
Right in the middle
of our front room window!

371
00:31:33,747 --> 00:31:35,578
Jesus, God.

372
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,850
- Honey?
- No. It's all right.

373
00:31:43,724 --> 00:31:45,191
Let's see...

374
00:31:45,526 --> 00:31:49,929
This goes to the radio
and this goes to the...

375
00:31:51,031 --> 00:31:53,522
Well, it's just one too many.

376
00:31:57,504 --> 00:31:58,493
Well, let's see.

377
00:31:58,572 --> 00:32:01,803
<i>The snap of a few sparks,
a quick whiff of ozone...</i>

378
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:05,333
<i>and the lamp blazed forth
in unparalleled glory.</i>

379
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:08,070
Look at that! Will you look at that?

380
00:32:08,248 --> 00:32:10,443
Isn't that glorious?

381
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,980
It's indescribably beautiful.
It reminds me of the Fourth of July!

382
00:32:16,824 --> 00:32:17,791
Turn off all the lights.

383
00:32:17,858 --> 00:32:19,792
I wanna see what it looks like
from the street.

384
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,658
- I'll go get the dining room.
- Couldn't we talk this over?

385
00:32:43,283 --> 00:32:46,548
Move it a little bit to the right.
A little that way.

386
00:32:47,321 --> 00:32:50,848
Just a little... More to the right.

387
00:32:51,925 --> 00:32:53,916
Yeah. More. That's it. No, stop!

388
00:32:54,061 --> 00:32:56,291
Right there. That's wonderful.

389
00:32:56,497 --> 00:32:58,055
Parker, what is that?

390
00:32:58,132 --> 00:33:00,032
Don't bother me now.
Can't you see I'm busy?

391
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,896
- Yeah, but what is that?
- It's a major award.

392
00:33:03,971 --> 00:33:05,302
A major award?

393
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,900
Shucks, I wouldn't have known that.
It looks like a lamp.

394
00:33:08,976 --> 00:33:12,377
It is a lamp, you nincompoop.
But it's a major award.

395
00:33:12,446 --> 00:33:13,708
I won it.

396
00:33:13,914 --> 00:33:16,678
- Damn, hell, you say you won it?
- Yeah.

397
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,512
Mind power, Sweed, mind power.

398
00:33:20,053 --> 00:33:22,351
<i>The entire neighborhood was turned on.</i>

399
00:33:22,456 --> 00:33:25,323
You should see what it looks like
from out here!

400
00:33:25,492 --> 00:33:28,461
<i>It could be seen
up and down Cleveland Street.</i>

401
00:33:28,529 --> 00:33:30,497
<i>The symbol of the old man's victory.</i>

402
00:33:30,631 --> 00:33:32,792
Yeah, he won that. It's a major award.

403
00:33:32,866 --> 00:33:36,358
Isn't it about time
for somebody's favorite radio program?

404
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:40,370
<i>Holy smokes, it was 6:45.</i>

405
00:33:40,507 --> 00:33:42,668
<i>Only one thing that
could've dragged me away...</i>

406
00:33:42,743 --> 00:33:46,736
<i>from the soft glow of electric sex
gleaming in the window.</i>

407
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:01,457
<i>Kids, it's Little Orphan Annie time.</i>

408
00:34:01,528 --> 00:34:04,190
<i>Brought to you by rich, chocolaty Ovaltine.</i>

409
00:34:04,832 --> 00:34:06,129
<i>I could still taste it.</i>

410
00:34:07,868 --> 00:34:09,665
Hey, you turned the light off!

411
00:34:26,353 --> 00:34:29,789
<i>I knew I was handing Miss Shields
a masterpiece.</i>

412
00:34:30,157 --> 00:34:33,558
<i>Maybe Miss Shields, in her ecstasy,
would excuse me from theme writing...</i>

413
00:34:33,627 --> 00:34:36,187
<i>for the rest of my natural life.</i>

414
00:34:43,937 --> 00:34:45,666
You call this a paragraph?

415
00:34:46,073 --> 00:34:50,237
Margins! Margins! "F"!

416
00:34:51,178 --> 00:34:53,976
My life's work down the drain.

417
00:34:54,915 --> 00:34:56,780
A semicolon, you dolt!

418
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:57,942
A period.

419
00:34:58,252 --> 00:34:59,014
"F"!

420
00:34:59,152 --> 00:35:03,555
Oh, I should weep
if I have to read one more "F"!

421
00:35:05,192 --> 00:35:06,750
Ralphie Parker.

422
00:35:22,409 --> 00:35:25,037
The theme I've been waiting for all my life.

423
00:35:25,512 --> 00:35:27,070
Listen to this sentence.

424
00:35:27,481 --> 00:35:31,850
"A Red Ryder BB gun with a compass
in the stock...

425
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,816
"and this thing which tells time."

426
00:35:37,925 --> 00:35:39,119
Poetry.

427
00:35:39,192 --> 00:35:40,659
Sheer poetry.

428
00:35:41,028 --> 00:35:44,225
Ralph, an "A+."

429
00:35:44,698 --> 00:35:46,256
My Ralph!

430
00:35:46,533 --> 00:35:49,502
Oh, Ralphie, you've made me proud.

431
00:35:51,438 --> 00:35:52,837
"A+"!

432
00:36:31,244 --> 00:36:32,768
Is there something you want, Ralph?

433
00:36:33,447 --> 00:36:36,075
I'm just turning in my theme.

434
00:36:38,218 --> 00:36:39,913
Well, you can take your seat now.

435
00:36:42,956 --> 00:36:44,150
Take your seat.

436
00:37:02,542 --> 00:37:04,271
Come on, you guys.

437
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:11,983
Get in the car. Get in the car.

438
00:37:12,853 --> 00:37:16,050
If we don't hurry
we're going to miss all the good trees!

439
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:21,685
<i>My mother was about to make
another brilliant maneuver...</i>

440
00:37:21,828 --> 00:37:24,763
<i>in the legendary battle of the lamp.</i>

441
00:37:24,898 --> 00:37:29,733
<i>The epic struggle which followed lives
in the folklore of Cleveland Street...</i>

442
00:37:29,836 --> 00:37:31,133
<i>to this very day.</i>

443
00:37:31,238 --> 00:37:34,002
Don't want to waste electricity.

444
00:37:34,207 --> 00:37:35,936
"Don't want to waste electricity."

445
00:37:36,176 --> 00:37:38,736
Come on, Ralphie. Get in the car.

446
00:37:44,418 --> 00:37:46,443
You folks looking for a tree?
We got 300 trees.

447
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,785
This is the Christmas tree emporium
of the entire Midwest.

448
00:37:49,856 --> 00:37:53,383
Now, you ain't gonna find no better tree
than this here tree.

449
00:37:53,794 --> 00:37:55,853
This here tree is built to last.

450
00:37:55,962 --> 00:37:57,759
Ain't no needles coming off this here tree.

451
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:03,162
Okay. Now here's a tree.

452
00:38:03,236 --> 00:38:05,101
This here is a tree.

453
00:38:05,205 --> 00:38:09,574
- That's a little skimpy in the front.
- Well, you just put it in the corner.

454
00:38:09,743 --> 00:38:13,372
- Haven't you got a big tree?
- Hell, this ain't no tree.

455
00:38:13,914 --> 00:38:16,314
Now here's a tree. This here is a tree.

456
00:38:17,951 --> 00:38:21,580
- Wait'll the dogs see that one.
- Don't you think it's a little large?

457
00:38:21,655 --> 00:38:24,954
Listen, Christmas only comes
once a year. Why not?

458
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:27,223
- How much?
- I'll knock off $2...

459
00:38:27,327 --> 00:38:29,420
because I can see you're a man
who knows his trees.

460
00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:32,896
This isn't one of those trees
that all the needles falls off, is it?

461
00:38:32,999 --> 00:38:34,694
No, that's them balsams.

462
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:37,497
<i>The old man loved bargaining
as much as an Arab trader...</i>

463
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:39,300
<i>and he was twice as shrewd.</i>

464
00:38:39,372 --> 00:38:41,772
You know, Dew Lock just bought
one of those brand new...

465
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:44,070
green plastic trees.

466
00:38:45,545 --> 00:38:47,706
Darn thing looks like it was made out of...

467
00:38:48,348 --> 00:38:50,248
green pipe cleaners.

468
00:38:50,884 --> 00:38:52,977
This is a very nice tree.

469
00:38:53,153 --> 00:38:55,587
I'll throw in some rope
and tie it to your car for you.

470
00:38:55,655 --> 00:38:57,122
You got a deal.

471
00:38:57,324 --> 00:38:58,154
Deal.

472
00:39:18,044 --> 00:39:19,739
Damn it. Blow out!

473
00:39:28,188 --> 00:39:29,746
Not again.

474
00:39:30,957 --> 00:39:32,390
Four minutes!

475
00:39:32,459 --> 00:39:33,983
Time me.

476
00:39:35,128 --> 00:39:36,959
<i>Actually, my old man loved it.</i>

477
00:39:37,063 --> 00:39:40,362
<i>He always saw himself in the pits
at the Indianapolis Speedway...</i>

478
00:39:40,467 --> 00:39:41,456
<i>in the 500.</i>

479
00:39:46,506 --> 00:39:49,441
<i>My old man's spare tires
were actually only tires...</i>

480
00:39:49,509 --> 00:39:50,703
<i>in the academic sense.</i>

481
00:39:50,911 --> 00:39:53,471
<i>They were round.
They had once been made of rubber.</i>

482
00:39:57,918 --> 00:40:01,012
Ralphie, why don't you
go help your father?

483
00:40:01,454 --> 00:40:03,081
- Really? Can I?
- Yes.

484
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,558
- Watch the traffic, there.
- Okay.

485
00:40:06,393 --> 00:40:08,918
<i>It was the first time that
it had been suggested that...</i>

486
00:40:08,995 --> 00:40:11,361
<i>I go help my father with anything.</i>

487
00:40:15,569 --> 00:40:18,265
- What are you doing here?
- Mom says I should help.

488
00:40:19,906 --> 00:40:22,466
Okay, sit down here. Squat down.

489
00:40:23,343 --> 00:40:24,640
Yeah, that's it.

490
00:40:24,844 --> 00:40:26,641
Here. Hold this.

491
00:40:30,317 --> 00:40:33,809
No, not that way.
Come on, rat trap, hold it like this.

492
00:40:33,887 --> 00:40:34,819
- How?
- Like this.

493
00:40:34,888 --> 00:40:36,788
I want to put the nuts in it. There we are.

494
00:40:36,856 --> 00:40:39,848
There's four of them. And we got it!

495
00:40:42,295 --> 00:40:43,694
There it is.

496
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:47,127
That son of a gun.
I'm gonna get that dirty...

497
00:40:47,534 --> 00:40:48,364
There we go.

498
00:40:49,603 --> 00:40:51,935
<i>For one brief moment
I saw all the bolts silhouetted...</i>

499
00:40:52,005 --> 00:40:54,530
<i>against the lights of the traffic.
And then they were gone.</i>

500
00:40:59,346 --> 00:41:01,405
Oh, fudge!

501
00:41:02,115 --> 00:41:04,015
<i>Only I didn't say "fudge."</i>

502
00:41:04,117 --> 00:41:05,948
<i>I said the word.</i>

503
00:41:06,152 --> 00:41:09,383
<i>The big one.
The queen mother of dirty words.</i>

504
00:41:09,723 --> 00:41:12,123
<i>The "f, dash, dash, dash" word.</i>

505
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,092
What did you say?

506
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:19,726
That's what I thought you said.

507
00:41:22,202 --> 00:41:23,999
Get in the car.

508
00:41:26,906 --> 00:41:27,930
Go on.

509
00:41:28,008 --> 00:41:30,272
<i>It was all over. I was dead.</i>

510
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:33,138
<i>What would it be?
The guillotine? Hanging?</i>

511
00:41:33,213 --> 00:41:36,114
<i>The chair? The rack?
The Chinese water torture?</i>

512
00:41:36,616 --> 00:41:40,609
<i>Mere child's play
compared to what surely awaited me.</i>

513
00:41:43,456 --> 00:41:45,720
Everything go all right?

514
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,135
Eight minutes.

515
00:42:04,444 --> 00:42:07,777
- Do you know what your son just said?
- No. What?

516
00:42:08,515 --> 00:42:10,813
I'll tell you what he said. Randy!

517
00:42:14,487 --> 00:42:15,215
Ralphie!

518
00:42:17,324 --> 00:42:20,225
<i>Over the years,
I got to be quite a connoisseur of soap.</i>

519
00:42:20,327 --> 00:42:24,525
<i>My personal preference is for Lux,
but I found Palmolive had a nice...</i>

520
00:42:24,698 --> 00:42:26,791
<i>piquant, after-dinner flavor.</i>

521
00:42:26,866 --> 00:42:30,393
<i>Heady, but with just a touch
of mellow smoothness.</i>

522
00:42:33,807 --> 00:42:36,207
<i>Lifebuoy, on the other hand...</i>

523
00:42:38,211 --> 00:42:40,076
You ready to tell me?

524
00:42:44,784 --> 00:42:47,344
All right. Where did you hear that word?

525
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,422
<i>Now I had heard that word at least
10 times a day from my old man.</i>

526
00:42:51,591 --> 00:42:53,889
<i>My father worked in profanity the way...</i>

527
00:42:53,993 --> 00:42:56,427
<i>other artists might work in oils or clay.</i>

528
00:42:56,529 --> 00:42:59,225
<i>It was his true medium. A master.</i>

529
00:42:59,299 --> 00:43:01,699
<i>But I chickened out. And I blurted out...</i>

530
00:43:01,868 --> 00:43:03,836
<i>the first name that came to mind.</i>

531
00:43:03,903 --> 00:43:05,165
Schwartz!

532
00:43:06,873 --> 00:43:08,465
I see.

533
00:43:19,853 --> 00:43:22,720
Hello, Mrs. Schwartz? Yes, I'm fine.

534
00:43:23,256 --> 00:43:26,714
Mrs. Schwartz,
do you know what Ralph just said?

535
00:43:28,528 --> 00:43:29,495
No.

536
00:43:29,763 --> 00:43:31,287
He said...

537
00:43:33,266 --> 00:43:34,790
<i>Not that!</i>

538
00:43:35,001 --> 00:43:36,263
Yes, that.

539
00:43:36,403 --> 00:43:39,372
<i>- Do you know where he heard it?
- Probably from his father.</i>

540
00:43:39,472 --> 00:43:41,963
No! He heard it from your son!

541
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:43,030
<i>What?</i>

542
00:43:51,117 --> 00:43:52,379
<i>What'd I do, Mom?</i>

543
00:43:53,153 --> 00:43:55,121
<i>Why? I didn't do nothing!</i>

544
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,823
<i>Another shot of mysterious,
inexorable, official justice.</i>

545
00:44:04,397 --> 00:44:09,164
Rinse out and go to bed.
Am I glad you finished your homework!

546
00:44:09,335 --> 00:44:12,270
Get right into bed,
and I don't want to see any lights on.

547
00:44:12,338 --> 00:44:15,307
You are being punished,
so no comic book reading!

548
00:44:15,408 --> 00:44:17,399
I'll come in, and if any lights are on...

549
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:20,411
Don't you give me that look!
You're gonna get it!

550
00:44:42,168 --> 00:44:44,932
<i>Three blocks away,
Schwartz was getting his.</i>

551
00:44:46,573 --> 00:44:48,973
<i>There has never been a kid
who didn't believe...</i>

552
00:44:49,175 --> 00:44:53,043
<i>vaguely but insistently,
that he would be stricken blind...</i>

553
00:44:53,213 --> 00:44:57,013
<i>before he reached 21.
And then they'd be sorry.</i>

554
00:45:07,794 --> 00:45:09,591
Why, it's Ralph!

555
00:45:10,463 --> 00:45:13,694
Well, come on in, Ralph.
Where've you been?

556
00:45:18,705 --> 00:45:20,036
Why, he's carrying a cane!

557
00:45:20,106 --> 00:45:21,596
What is it, Ralph? What happened?

558
00:45:21,674 --> 00:45:23,539
Why, he's blind!

559
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:25,441
Blind? Oh, my God!

560
00:45:28,581 --> 00:45:30,242
Ralph, is it something we did?

561
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:33,183
What brought you to this lonely state?

562
00:45:34,487 --> 00:45:37,422
Ralph, please tell us no matter
how it hurts. What did we do?

563
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:40,054
Look, I can't.

564
00:45:40,126 --> 00:45:42,026
Please, Ralph. I must know what we did.

565
00:45:42,262 --> 00:45:44,162
What brought you to this?

566
00:45:53,673 --> 00:45:55,834
Soap poisoning.

567
00:46:02,849 --> 00:46:05,044
Oh, how could we do it?

568
00:46:05,718 --> 00:46:08,778
I'll manage to get along, somehow.

569
00:46:09,756 --> 00:46:12,190
- I'll never forgive myself.
- Thanks, Mom.

570
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:14,952
I told you not to use Lifebuoy.

571
00:46:16,029 --> 00:46:17,826
I feel awful!

572
00:46:42,855 --> 00:46:43,719
Thank you, Heather.

573
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:45,587
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

574
00:46:46,392 --> 00:46:47,188
Thank you, Flick.

575
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,384
Merry Christmas, Miss Shields.

576
00:47:14,454 --> 00:47:17,480
I just thought that you'd be getting tired
of the same old stuff.

577
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:20,855
<i>Yes, truly, a little bribe never hurts.</i>

578
00:47:21,394 --> 00:47:23,453
Well, thank you very much, Ralph.

579
00:47:28,901 --> 00:47:30,698
Merry Christmas.

580
00:47:33,439 --> 00:47:34,701
Happy New Year.

581
00:47:37,543 --> 00:47:39,602
You can take your seat now, Ralph.

582
00:48:03,202 --> 00:48:06,262
<i>The weeks of drinking gallons of Ovaltine,
in order to get...</i>

583
00:48:06,372 --> 00:48:09,808
<i>the Ovaltine inner seal to send off

584
00:48:09,876 --> 00:48:13,403
<i>secret decoder pen, was about to pay off.</i>

585
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:16,876
I got it. "Master Ralph Parker."

586
00:48:16,949 --> 00:48:18,678
My decoder pen!

587
00:48:23,056 --> 00:48:24,523
All right!

604

<i>Pierre was in great voice tonight.</i>

610
00:49:36,863 --> 00:49:40,629
<i>I could tell that tonight's message
was really important.</i>

<i>...3. 25.</i>

612
00:49:42,201 --> 00:49:46,365
<i>That's a message from Annie herself.
Remember, don't tell anyone.</i>

613
00:49:50,176 --> 00:49:53,145
<i>Ninety seconds later
I'm in the only room in the house...</i>

<i>Ah! "B." I went to the next.</i>

616
00:50:02,588 --> 00:50:05,216
<i>"E." The first word is "be"!</i>

617

<i>"S." It was coming easier now. "U."</i>

Come on, Ralphie! I gotta go.

619
00:50:13,866 --> 00:50:15,595
I'll be right down, Ma.

624
00:50:28,181 --> 00:50:31,173
Ralphie! Randy has got to go!
Will you please come out?

625
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,980
All right, Ma! I'll be right out!

626
00:50:34,353 --> 00:50:35,820
<i>I was getting closer now.</i>

627
00:50:35,922 --> 00:50:38,891
<i>The tension was terrible. What was it?</i>

628
00:50:38,958 --> 00:50:41,188
<i>The fate of the planet
may hang in the balance.</i>

629
00:50:41,727 --> 00:50:43,786
Ralphie! Randy's gotta go!

630
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:47,358
I'll be right out, for crying out loud!

631
00:50:47,733 --> 00:50:50,463
<i>Almost there! My fingers flew.</i>

632
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:52,231
<i>My mind was a steel trap.</i>

633
00:50:52,338 --> 00:50:53,737
<i>Every pore vibrated.</i>

634
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,801
<i>It was almost clear.</i>

635
00:50:55,975 --> 00:50:56,999
<i>Yes!</i>

636
00:51:04,183 --> 00:51:05,411
Ovaltine?

637
00:51:09,155 --> 00:51:10,884
A crummy commercial?

638
00:51:13,526 --> 00:51:15,050
Son of a bitch!

639
00:51:17,296 --> 00:51:19,787
<i>I went out to face the world again.</i>

640
00:51:19,932 --> 00:51:21,365
<i>Wiser.</i>

641
00:51:34,313 --> 00:51:35,780
Red cabbage?

642
00:51:35,848 --> 00:51:38,817
No, that's for tomorrow night.
You love red cabbage, Ralphie.

643
00:51:40,753 --> 00:51:42,721
You filthy system!

644
00:51:42,788 --> 00:51:44,449
I hate it!

645
00:51:44,624 --> 00:51:47,252
Schmucker! Smelly watt-buster!

646
00:51:55,968 --> 00:52:00,337
<i>What happened next
was a family controversy for years.</i>

647
00:52:17,256 --> 00:52:18,382
What was that? What happened?

648
00:52:22,628 --> 00:52:24,061
What happened?

649
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:26,320
What broke?

650
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:28,362
I don't know what happened.

651
00:52:28,434 --> 00:52:30,698
I was watering my plant and...

652
00:52:32,004 --> 00:52:33,767
I broke your lamp.

653
00:52:48,955 --> 00:52:50,616
Don't you touch that!

654
00:52:51,624 --> 00:52:53,751
You were always jealous of this lamp.

655
00:52:54,493 --> 00:52:55,960
Jealous of a plastic leg?

656
00:52:56,062 --> 00:52:57,222
Jealous!

657
00:52:57,396 --> 00:52:59,626
Jealous because I won.

658
00:53:01,534 --> 00:53:03,024
That's ridiculous! Jealous?

659
00:53:03,169 --> 00:53:04,295
Jealous of what?

660
00:53:05,538 --> 00:53:06,835
That is...

661
00:53:06,906 --> 00:53:10,865
the ugliest lamp
I have ever seen in my entire life!

662
00:53:11,243 --> 00:53:12,801
<i>Now it was out.</i>

663
00:53:13,212 --> 00:53:14,509
Get the glue.

664
00:53:15,081 --> 00:53:17,345
We're out of glue.

665
00:53:19,652 --> 00:53:23,986
You used up all the glue on purpose!

666
00:53:25,825 --> 00:53:28,225
<i>The old man stood quivering with fury...</i>

667
00:53:28,327 --> 00:53:30,761
<i>stammering as he tried
to come up with a real crusher.</i>

668
00:53:31,163 --> 00:53:32,425
<i>All he got out was:</i>

669
00:53:32,498 --> 00:53:33,795
Not a finger!

670
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,770
<i>With as much dignity as he could muster...</i>

671
00:54:16,876 --> 00:54:19,436
<i>the old man gathered up the sad remains...</i>

672
00:54:19,545 --> 00:54:22,070
<i>of his shattered major award.</i>

673
00:54:22,948 --> 00:54:25,746
<i>Later that night, alone in the backyard...</i>

674
00:54:26,152 --> 00:54:27,983
<i>he buried it next to the garage.</i>

675
00:54:28,587 --> 00:54:30,248
<i>Now I could never be sure...</i>

676
00:54:30,723 --> 00:54:34,318
<i>but I thought that I heard
the sound of taps being played...</i>

677
00:54:34,627 --> 00:54:35,889
<i>gently.</i>

678
00:54:36,295 --> 00:54:38,024
Know what I'm getting my old man
for Christmas?

679
00:54:38,097 --> 00:54:39,894
- What?
- A rose that squirts.

680
00:54:39,965 --> 00:54:42,024
People come to smell it, it squirts them.

681
00:54:42,201 --> 00:54:45,728
- I'm getting my old man a Flit gun.
- A Flit gun?

682
00:54:49,075 --> 00:54:50,235
Stop right there!

683
00:54:50,443 --> 00:54:54,379
<i>Ordinarily, if Dill so much as
said "hi" to you, you felt great...</i>

684
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,407
<i>warm inside.
But mostly he just hit you in the mouth.</i>

685
00:54:58,684 --> 00:55:01,346
I can't now, Grover.
I've gotta go see Miss Shields.

686
00:55:01,687 --> 00:55:04,588
Hey, come here! Get over here!

687
00:55:05,024 --> 00:55:06,958
Come on, you! Hey, come here!

688
00:55:08,461 --> 00:55:09,393
You! Come here!

689
00:55:09,628 --> 00:55:10,356
Who, me?

690
00:55:10,596 --> 00:55:13,497
- No, your Aunt Tilly.
- Yeah, you. Get over here!

691
00:55:13,699 --> 00:55:16,691
<i>I left Flick to certain annihilation.</i>

692
00:55:17,736 --> 00:55:20,227
<i>But BB gun mania knows no loyalties.</i>

693
00:55:20,706 --> 00:55:22,674
Uncle! Uncle!

694
00:55:27,646 --> 00:55:28,670
All right, class.

695
00:55:29,115 --> 00:55:31,709
I have your Christmas themes for you.

696
00:55:32,751 --> 00:55:34,116
I'm pleased.

697
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,915
In general, you did very well.

698
00:55:40,092 --> 00:55:43,619
However, I was disappointed
in the margins.

699
00:55:46,265 --> 00:55:47,857
<i>This is it.</i>

700
00:55:49,235 --> 00:55:51,430
<i>"C+"? No, it can't be.</i>

701
00:55:51,871 --> 00:55:53,270
C+?

702
00:55:53,439 --> 00:55:55,464
C+!

703
00:56:03,249 --> 00:56:04,477
<i>Oh, no!</i>

704
00:56:05,651 --> 00:56:07,312
<i>"You'll shoot your eye out"?</i>

705
00:56:09,655 --> 00:56:11,623
<i>My mother
must have gotten to Miss Shields.</i>

706
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:13,382
<i>There could be no other explanation.</i>

707
00:56:13,659 --> 00:56:17,789
You'll shoot your eye out.
You'll shoot your eye out.

708
00:56:20,366 --> 00:56:24,097
<i>Was there no end to this conspiracy
of irrational prejudice...</i>

709
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:26,468
<i>against Red Ryder and his peacemaker?</i>

710
00:56:26,672 --> 00:56:30,870
These multiplication questions
were most missed in our last math test.

711
00:56:30,976 --> 00:56:32,534
Would you answer in unison, please?

712
00:56:32,845 --> 00:56:35,746
<i>I was surrounded by happier kids
who were all going to get...</i>

713
00:56:35,848 --> 00:56:37,406
<i>what they wanted for Christmas.</i>

714
00:56:37,783 --> 00:56:39,011
...fifty-six.

715
00:57:09,682 --> 00:57:11,206
Hey, four-eyes!

716
00:57:11,283 --> 00:57:13,843
How'd you like your snowball sandwich?

717
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,511
Maybe you'd like another one!

718
00:57:22,061 --> 00:57:23,050
Listen, jerk.

719
00:57:23,295 --> 00:57:26,594
When I tell you to come, you better come!

720
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,268
What? Are you going to cry now?

721
00:57:30,469 --> 00:57:34,235
Come on, cry baby, cry for me. Come on.

722
00:57:34,607 --> 00:57:36,097
Cry!

723
00:57:36,242 --> 00:57:38,039
<i>Deep in the recesses of my brain...</i>

724
00:57:38,177 --> 00:57:41,544
<i>a tiny red-hot little flame began to grow.</i>

725
00:57:55,294 --> 00:57:56,420
<i>Something had happened.</i>

726
00:57:56,595 --> 00:58:00,588
<i>A fuse blew
and I had gone out of my skull.</i>

727
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:12,142
I'm telling my dad!

728
00:58:13,545 --> 00:58:15,638
Hey, Ralphie!

729
00:58:22,488 --> 00:58:24,615
Beat him up! Beat him up!

730
00:58:39,104 --> 00:58:41,368
Did you hear what he said?

731
00:58:45,978 --> 00:58:48,412
<i>I have since heard of people under...</i>

732
00:58:48,514 --> 00:58:52,177
<i>extreme duress speaking
in strange tongues.</i>

733
00:58:52,484 --> 00:58:55,942
<i>I became conscious
that a steady torrent of obscenities...</i>

734
00:58:56,121 --> 00:59:00,421
<i>and swearing of all kinds
was pouring out of me as I screamed.</i>

735
00:59:09,268 --> 00:59:10,826
Ralphie!

736
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,585
We're going home. Come on.

737
00:59:48,707 --> 00:59:51,676
Calm down. Come on in here, Ralph.

738
00:59:56,181 --> 00:59:57,614
Put your head down in here.

739
00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:00,211
Come on, get down in here.

740
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,878
Settle down.

741
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:08,921
I want you to go in there
and lie down in your room for a while.

742
01:00:10,028 --> 01:00:12,155
Ralphie, just settle down.

743
01:00:15,868 --> 01:00:17,631
Here, dry off.

744
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:19,838
All right, calm down.

745
01:00:19,972 --> 01:00:22,406
All right. Now go lie down.

746
01:00:42,161 --> 01:00:44,721
<i>The light was getting purple
and soft outside.</i>

747
01:00:44,863 --> 01:00:47,696
<i>Almost time for my father
to come home from work.</i>

748
01:01:08,086 --> 01:01:09,678
What's the matter? What you crying for?

749
01:01:10,656 --> 01:01:13,090
Daddy's going to kill Ralphie.

750
01:01:13,692 --> 01:01:15,159
No, he's not.

751
01:01:15,294 --> 01:01:16,659
Yes, he is, too.

752
01:01:16,762 --> 01:01:18,320
No, he's not.

753
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:22,628
I promise you
Daddy is not going to kill Ralphie.

754
01:01:23,502 --> 01:01:25,026
Why don't you come on out of there?

755
01:01:28,607 --> 01:01:29,767
Would you like some milk?

756
01:01:31,643 --> 01:01:33,372
You would?

757
01:01:40,018 --> 01:01:41,212
Here you go.

758
01:01:42,554 --> 01:01:43,578
All right?

759
01:01:44,289 --> 01:01:47,019
I'll see you later? Okay. Bye.

760
01:01:59,338 --> 01:02:03,001
<i>I heard the car roar up the driveway,
and a wave of terror broke over me.</i>

761
01:02:03,242 --> 01:02:06,268
<i>He'll know what I said,
the awful things that I said.</i>

762
01:02:06,512 --> 01:02:08,309
Get out of here!

763
01:02:08,981 --> 01:02:12,246
Go on home, you mangy mutts.
Get out of here, you rotten, filthy...

764
01:02:12,518 --> 01:02:13,246
Hey, Bumpus!

765
01:02:13,318 --> 01:02:15,786
Get over here and get your stinking dogs!

766
01:02:16,889 --> 01:02:19,949
Hey, come on, what's for dinner?
I'm starving to death.

767
01:02:39,845 --> 01:02:42,473
Well, what happened today?

768
01:02:43,181 --> 01:02:44,512
Where's your glasses?

769
01:02:45,951 --> 01:02:47,612
Did you lose your glasses again?

770
01:02:47,986 --> 01:02:48,918
Ralphie.

771
01:02:49,254 --> 01:02:52,348
Remember, you left these
on the radio again.

772
01:02:52,591 --> 01:02:55,424
Now try not to do that anymore.

773
01:02:56,461 --> 01:02:58,019
So what else happened today?

774
01:02:59,531 --> 01:03:00,930
Nothing much.

775
01:03:01,133 --> 01:03:02,464
Ralphie had a fight.

776
01:03:03,268 --> 01:03:04,030
A fight?

777
01:03:04,236 --> 01:03:05,567
What kind of a fight?

778
01:03:08,006 --> 01:03:10,065
You know how boys are.

779
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:13,610
I gave him a talking to.

780
01:03:15,013 --> 01:03:18,380
I see that the Bears
are playing Green Bay on Sunday.

781
01:03:20,252 --> 01:03:21,014
Oh, yeah.

782
01:03:21,186 --> 01:03:23,211
Zudock's got tickets. I wish I had.

783
01:03:23,522 --> 01:03:25,422
He'll freeze his keister off out there.

784
01:03:28,493 --> 01:03:31,985
<i>I slowly began to realize
I was not about to be destroyed.</i>

785
01:03:32,364 --> 01:03:33,831
The Chicago Bears.

786
01:03:34,433 --> 01:03:35,923
The terror of the midway.

787
01:03:36,902 --> 01:03:40,394
<i>From then on, things were different
between me and my mother.</i>

788
01:03:42,674 --> 01:03:45,734
More like the Chicago Chipmunks, maybe.

789
01:03:45,911 --> 01:03:47,037
But Bears, never.

790
01:03:49,014 --> 01:03:50,003
<i>Strange.</i>

791
01:03:50,282 --> 01:03:54,013
<i>Even something as monumental
as "The Scut Farkus Affair"...</i>

792
01:03:54,252 --> 01:03:55,776
<i>as it came to be known...</i>

793
01:03:55,954 --> 01:03:58,548
<i>was pushed out of my mind
as I struggled for a way out...</i>

794
01:03:58,624 --> 01:04:01,457
<i>of the impenetrable BB gun web...</i>

795
01:04:01,526 --> 01:04:03,585
<i>in which my mother had me trapped.</i>

796
01:04:03,929 --> 01:04:05,021
Santa!

797
01:04:05,731 --> 01:04:07,460
Yeah, I'll ask Santa.

798
01:04:08,166 --> 01:04:09,827
<i>Of course! Santa.</i>

799
01:04:10,135 --> 01:04:12,194
<i>The big man. The head honcho.</i>

800
01:04:12,437 --> 01:04:13,665
<i>The connection.</i>

801
01:04:13,939 --> 01:04:16,533
<i>My mother had slipped up this time.</i>

802
01:04:38,697 --> 01:04:40,324
Mickey!

803
01:04:57,382 --> 01:04:59,942
The store's going to close soon
and Santa will be gone.

804
01:05:00,018 --> 01:05:04,045
Ralphie, Santa's not going anyplace.
Just be still!

805
01:05:13,699 --> 01:05:16,133
Mom, this is just
the same old dumb parade as last year.

806
01:05:16,234 --> 01:05:19,431
- Ralphie, will you please calm down.
- Mom--

807
01:05:19,838 --> 01:05:21,465
- Hush!
- Shut up, Ralphie!

808
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:31,879
There he is!

809
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:34,111
Santa!

810
01:05:41,426 --> 01:05:43,917
Have you been a good boy? Have you?

811
01:05:44,062 --> 01:05:46,895
- Can we go now? Can we go?
- Yes, we can go now.

812
01:05:47,032 --> 01:05:49,227
Come on, Ralphie.

813
01:06:00,879 --> 01:06:02,972
Merry Christmas!

814
01:06:05,684 --> 01:06:08,050
Come on, Randy, hurry up.

815
01:06:21,166 --> 01:06:23,361
Ralphie, look over there.

816
01:06:23,435 --> 01:06:26,461
See, the line's not so long. Get in it.

817
01:06:26,538 --> 01:06:29,405
Take Randy's hand and hold on to him.
We'll see you later, okay?

818
01:06:29,474 --> 01:06:32,637
Stay together, you hear?
And don't get lost.

819
01:06:36,214 --> 01:06:37,306
Come on.

820
01:06:37,449 --> 01:06:38,916
Let's go.

821
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:43,447
Young man.

822
01:06:43,622 --> 01:06:44,748
Hey, kid.

823
01:06:45,123 --> 01:06:48,684
- Just where do you think you're going?
- We're going up to see Santa.

824
01:06:49,528 --> 01:06:52,326
The line ends here. It begins there.

825
01:06:52,764 --> 01:06:54,459
Merry Christmas!

826
01:06:54,666 --> 01:06:57,760
Come on, come up, boys and girls.
Hurry up.

827
01:07:03,675 --> 01:07:05,108
Come on.

828
01:07:09,014 --> 01:07:13,815
<i>The line waiting to see Santa stretched
all the way back to Terre Haute!</i>

829
01:07:14,452 --> 01:07:16,352
<i>And I was at the end of it.</i>

830
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:20,749
I like Santa.

831
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:27,325
<i>Let's face it. Most of us were scoffers.</i>

832
01:07:27,399 --> 01:07:32,427
<i>Moments before zero hour,
it did not pay to take chances.</i>

833
01:07:33,371 --> 01:07:37,501
The chocolate snowman eats little boys.

834
01:07:39,244 --> 01:07:40,802
My pretty...

835
01:07:41,046 --> 01:07:43,173
What a tasty little boy.

836
01:07:44,449 --> 01:07:47,350
Don't bother me. I'm thinking.

837
01:07:51,756 --> 01:07:53,883
<i>I like The Wizard of Oz.</i>

838
01:07:57,162 --> 01:07:59,096
I like the Tin Man.

839
01:08:03,301 --> 01:08:07,397
If Higbee thinks I'm working one minute
past 9:00, he can kiss my foot.

840
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,099
Come on up on Santa's lap.

841
01:08:11,209 --> 01:08:15,646
There's a wet one.
And what's your name, little boy?

842
01:08:15,847 --> 01:08:16,836
Billy.

843
01:08:16,915 --> 01:08:18,109
Come on, Randy.

844
01:08:19,684 --> 01:08:22,881
And what do you want for Christmas,
Billy? A toy truck?

845
01:08:22,988 --> 01:08:24,922
Get him off my lap.

846
01:08:25,056 --> 01:08:26,853
Quick, get me a towel.

847
01:08:34,599 --> 01:08:36,692
I hate the smell of tapioca.

848
01:08:38,236 --> 01:08:41,672
<i>Attention shoppers! It is now 9:00
and our store is closing.</i>

849
01:08:42,073 --> 01:08:45,008
<i>9:00! Great Scott!
The store is gonna close!</i>

850
01:08:46,044 --> 01:08:48,638
Santa can't wait all night.

851
01:08:49,214 --> 01:08:51,307
Come on up on Santa's lap.

852
01:09:01,092 --> 01:09:02,218
Get moving, kid.

853
01:09:03,561 --> 01:09:05,256
Quit dragging your feet.

854
01:09:18,376 --> 01:09:19,934
Get him out of here.

855
01:09:30,655 --> 01:09:32,418
Come on, kid.

856
01:09:38,496 --> 01:09:40,987
Come on up.

857
01:09:51,343 --> 01:09:54,835
And what's your name, little boy?

858
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:58,416
Hey, kid, hurry up, the store's closing!

859
01:10:01,453 --> 01:10:06,117
Listen, little boy, we got
a lot of people waiting here, so get going!

860
01:10:08,326 --> 01:10:11,295
What do you want for Christmas,
little boy?

861
01:10:11,663 --> 01:10:13,756
<i>My mind had gone blank.</i>

862
01:10:13,898 --> 01:10:16,128
<i>Frantically I tried to remember
what it was I wanted.</i>

863
01:10:16,201 --> 01:10:17,759
<i>I was blowing it, blowing it.</i>

864
01:10:20,805 --> 01:10:23,865
How about a nice football?

865
01:10:24,009 --> 01:10:27,001
<i>Football. What's a football?</i>

866
01:10:27,712 --> 01:10:29,839
<i>Without conscious will,
my voice squeaked out:</i>

867
01:10:29,948 --> 01:10:31,176
Football.

868
01:10:31,716 --> 01:10:33,308
Okay, get him out of here.

869
01:10:33,852 --> 01:10:37,185
<i>A football! Oh, no. What was I doing?</i>

870
01:10:37,255 --> 01:10:39,621
<i>Wake up, stupid, wake up!</i>

871
01:10:47,432 --> 01:10:50,526
I want an official Red Ryder
carbine-action 200-shot...

872
01:10:50,635 --> 01:10:51,693
range model air rifle.

873
01:10:53,772 --> 01:10:55,467
You'll shoot your eye out, kid.

874
01:10:57,208 --> 01:10:59,005
Merry Christmas.

875
01:11:14,726 --> 01:11:16,523
I'll see you in Oz, folks.

876
01:11:25,103 --> 01:11:27,071
Well, did you see Santa Claus?

877
01:11:27,639 --> 01:11:30,073
Did you tell him
what you wanted for Christmas?

878
01:11:30,175 --> 01:11:33,906
Did he ask you if you'd been
a good boy all year?

879
01:11:34,312 --> 01:11:35,040
No.

880
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,007
Don't worry, he knows.

881
01:11:38,716 --> 01:11:40,240
He always knows.

882
01:11:43,021 --> 01:11:45,649
Merry Christmas.

883
01:11:46,591 --> 01:11:48,923
Okay, down you go.

884
01:11:49,194 --> 01:11:50,354
Bye, Chris.

885
01:12:00,705 --> 01:12:03,003
That's fine.

886
01:12:03,808 --> 01:12:06,368
Now wait a minute. All right. Plug her in!

887
01:12:08,279 --> 01:12:09,906
Well, the green string is out.

888
01:12:10,014 --> 01:12:12,278
No, the green is on. It's the blue that's out.

889
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:14,643
Oh, don't tell me what color it is.

890
01:12:14,752 --> 01:12:15,912
I'm not color blind.

891
01:12:16,688 --> 01:12:18,178
I'm not color blind, either.

892
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:23,350
There, see, I told you it was green.

893
01:12:25,864 --> 01:12:27,991
Hold it! Don't anybody move!

894
01:12:29,467 --> 01:12:30,866
Hold it right there!

895
01:12:31,503 --> 01:12:33,266
A fuse is out.

896
01:12:33,771 --> 01:12:37,468
<i>The old man could replace fuses
quicker than a jackrabbit on a date.</i>

897
01:12:37,542 --> 01:12:39,169
<i>He bought them by the gross.</i>

898
01:12:45,083 --> 01:12:46,812
Oh, Ralph.

899
01:12:47,118 --> 01:12:49,484
My, isn't that pretty?

900
01:12:49,654 --> 01:12:50,951
That son of a gun.

901
01:12:52,924 --> 01:12:54,118
Yeah. No.

902
01:12:54,259 --> 01:12:55,920
That star is crooked.

903
01:12:56,194 --> 01:12:58,128
That star is perfectly straight.

904
01:13:00,632 --> 01:13:02,725
- Oh, you've got to be careful.
- I am.

905
01:13:05,436 --> 01:13:08,564
It's just... Let me get it fixed.
That's all right.

906
01:13:14,646 --> 01:13:16,170
Perfect.

907
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:20,881
Oh, goodness, look at the time.

908
01:13:20,952 --> 01:13:22,943
I hope Santa hasn't had to pass up
this house...

909
01:13:23,021 --> 01:13:26,047
just because some boys
weren't in bed when he came by.

910
01:13:26,191 --> 01:13:28,785
I thought I heard Santa's sleigh bells...

911
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:31,385
a little while ago,
going up the other side of the street.

912
01:13:32,463 --> 01:13:33,794
All right, you two, upstairs.

913
01:13:34,933 --> 01:13:36,958
Go on the double, on the double.

914
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:49,571
Okay, let's get them.

915
01:14:52,944 --> 01:14:55,003
Randy, come on! Get up, Randy!

916
01:15:05,723 --> 01:15:07,816
<i>Santa Claus had come!</i>

917
01:15:11,396 --> 01:15:13,591
Wow! A truck! That's mine!

918
01:15:14,165 --> 01:15:16,395
Wow, look over here! That's mine!

919
01:15:16,467 --> 01:15:17,957
What's in here?

920
01:15:18,303 --> 01:15:19,327
It's hard.

921
01:15:19,671 --> 01:15:22,731
Fire truck. Oh boy, that's mine!

922
01:15:31,816 --> 01:15:33,113
Does this raise?

923
01:15:48,299 --> 01:15:49,527
Merry Christmas.

924
01:15:51,002 --> 01:15:53,334
Merry Christmas, you two.

925
01:15:54,138 --> 01:15:56,834
Randy, no.
Wait for Christmas to start, honey.

926
01:15:57,275 --> 01:16:00,335
- I want to play Santa!
- Well, wait a minute, Randy.

927
01:16:00,411 --> 01:16:02,311
He played Santa last year, didn't he?

928
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,807
Ralphie, you play Santa this time.

929
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:07,017
- Come on, Ralphie.
- Who should I start with?

930
01:16:07,318 --> 01:16:09,616
Well, give Randy a present.

931
01:16:09,721 --> 01:16:13,885
And, I think I see Aunt Clara's gift to you
right over there.

932
01:16:13,991 --> 01:16:16,425
She always sends you
such wonderful presents.

933
01:16:16,794 --> 01:16:19,490
Give me mine, Ralphie! Come on.

934
01:16:36,381 --> 01:16:40,875
<i>Christmas had come. Officially.
We plunged into the cornucopia...</i>

935
01:16:40,952 --> 01:16:44,820
<i>quivering with desire
and the ecstasy of unbridled avarice.</i>

936
01:16:44,956 --> 01:16:46,389
Didn't I get a tie this year?

937
01:16:53,531 --> 01:16:56,830
- A zeppelin!
- A can of Simonize.

938
01:16:57,635 --> 01:17:00,798
Ralphie, what did Aunt Clara give you?
Show everybody.

939
01:17:05,977 --> 01:17:06,841
I don't want to.

940
01:17:07,445 --> 01:17:09,879
Ralphie, show everybody
what Aunt Clara gave you.

941
01:17:10,815 --> 01:17:13,648
<i>Aunt Clara had for years labored
under the delusion that...</i>

942
01:17:13,718 --> 01:17:18,246
<i>I was not only perpetually four years old,
but also a girl.</i>

943
01:17:18,756 --> 01:17:22,624
She just always gives you
the nicest things, Ralphie.

944
01:17:27,131 --> 01:17:29,929
Oh, isn't that sweet?

945
01:17:30,368 --> 01:17:33,166
- Ralph, go upstairs and try it on you--
- I don't want to!

946
01:17:33,271 --> 01:17:35,671
Go upstairs right now
and try on that present!

947
01:17:35,773 --> 01:17:39,140
She went to all that trouble to make it!
Now go on.

948
01:17:46,818 --> 01:17:50,982
While Ralphie is changing,
I'm going to play Santa Claus.

949
01:17:51,055 --> 01:17:52,682
Now, let me see what can I find.

950
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:56,451
I see something! Randy.

951
01:17:56,694 --> 01:17:58,457
This is for you, honey.

952
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:01,264
And this is for Daddy.

953
01:18:04,202 --> 01:18:04,896
Here.

954
01:18:04,969 --> 01:18:06,834
From me to you.

955
01:18:09,106 --> 01:18:10,937
Thanks a lot.

956
01:18:11,342 --> 01:18:13,572
I wonder what it could be?

957
01:18:14,579 --> 01:18:17,571
Only one way to find out, isn't there?

958
01:18:17,849 --> 01:18:20,044
Well, it's a blue ball!

959
01:18:21,719 --> 01:18:23,482
It's a bowling ball.

960
01:18:24,489 --> 01:18:25,751
Thank you, darling.

961
01:18:25,857 --> 01:18:28,985
- Do you like it?
- Yes, very much. Very much.

962
01:18:29,694 --> 01:18:30,592
Ralphie.

963
01:18:30,795 --> 01:18:32,820
We're waiting.

964
01:18:32,997 --> 01:18:34,555
Oh, come on, Mom.

965
01:18:34,999 --> 01:18:36,660
Right now!

966
01:18:46,744 --> 01:18:50,373
<i>Immediately my feet began to sweat
as those two fluffy little bunnies...</i>

967
01:18:50,448 --> 01:18:53,815
<i>with the blue button eyes
stared sappily up at me.</i>

968
01:18:54,552 --> 01:18:57,248
Come down here so I can see you better.

969
01:18:58,089 --> 01:18:59,886
<i>I just hoped Flick would never spot them...</i>

970
01:19:00,024 --> 01:19:03,323
<i>as the word of this humiliation
could easily make life...</i>

971
01:19:03,394 --> 01:19:06,227
<i>at Warren G. Harding School
a veritable hell.</i>

972
01:19:08,666 --> 01:19:09,655
Isn't that cute?

973
01:19:10,334 --> 01:19:13,963
That is the most precious thing
I've ever seen in my life.

974
01:19:14,772 --> 01:19:15,670
Shut up, Randy.

975
01:19:16,674 --> 01:19:18,767
He looks like a deranged Easter bunny.

976
01:19:20,978 --> 01:19:22,673
- He does not!
- He does, too.

977
01:19:22,747 --> 01:19:24,442
He looks like a pink nightmare.

978
01:19:25,116 --> 01:19:27,107
Are you happy wearing that?

979
01:19:27,451 --> 01:19:28,440
Do you want to take it off?

980
01:19:28,653 --> 01:19:29,881
You tell the kid to take it off.

981
01:19:29,954 --> 01:19:32,923
You'll only wear it when Aunt Clara visits.
Go on and take it off.

982
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:34,651
Take it off!

983
01:19:38,262 --> 01:19:40,162
My God, will you look at that mess?

984
01:19:40,565 --> 01:19:42,999
- Who's going to clean the papers up?
- Not me.

985
01:19:44,402 --> 01:19:46,734
- Randy did it last year.
- Well, he can do it again.

986
01:19:49,307 --> 01:19:52,208
You know, this wine is not bad.
It's not good either, but...

987
01:19:52,276 --> 01:19:54,836
- You want a sip?
- No, you don't.

988
01:19:56,314 --> 01:19:57,406
Did you have a nice Christmas?

989
01:19:58,149 --> 01:19:59,116
Yeah, pretty nice.

990
01:19:59,216 --> 01:20:00,683
Did you get everything you wanted?

991
01:20:01,652 --> 01:20:04,314
- Well, almost.
- Almost?

992
01:20:04,422 --> 01:20:06,049
Well, that's life.

993
01:20:06,724 --> 01:20:08,419
Well, there's always next Christmas.

994
01:20:11,662 --> 01:20:13,027
That's funny.

995
01:20:13,931 --> 01:20:15,728
What's that over there behind the desk?

996
01:20:16,767 --> 01:20:17,699
Where?

997
01:20:17,768 --> 01:20:19,599
Behind the desk,
against the wall over there.

998
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:23,771
Why don't you go check it out?

999
01:20:40,458 --> 01:20:41,755
What did we put over there, honey?

1000
01:20:43,227 --> 01:20:45,320
Santa Claus probably put it.

1001
01:21:22,199 --> 01:21:26,033
<i>Oh, it was beautiful.
I could hardly wait to try it out.</i>

1002
01:21:26,804 --> 01:21:28,465
Do you know how to load it?

1003
01:21:31,909 --> 01:21:33,171
That's right.

1004
01:21:40,851 --> 01:21:41,749
Be careful.

1005
01:21:42,219 --> 01:21:43,652
Don't. They run all over.

1006
01:21:50,494 --> 01:21:51,756
Close her up. Close it up.

1007
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:55,526
Can I try it out, Ma? Can I?

1008
01:21:55,633 --> 01:21:57,100
- Sure.
- Okay.

1009
01:21:57,568 --> 01:21:58,694
But outside.

1010
01:21:58,803 --> 01:22:00,668
I still say those things are dangerous.

1011
01:22:02,173 --> 01:22:04,767
Put on your galoshes and your coat.
It's cold out.

1012
01:22:08,212 --> 01:22:11,147
I had one when I was eight years old.

1013
01:22:11,749 --> 01:22:14,274
What if he hurts himself?
Ralphie, your coat!

1014
01:22:15,586 --> 01:22:19,488
- Don't shoot any animals or birds!
- Except the Bumpuses' dogs!

1015
01:22:21,092 --> 01:22:23,083
Be careful, Ralphie!

1016
01:22:23,761 --> 01:22:26,855
<i>Now it is well known throughout
the Midwest that the old man...</i>

1017
01:22:26,931 --> 01:22:28,796
<i>is a turkey junkie.</i>

1018
01:22:29,667 --> 01:22:33,967
<i>A bona fide garley turkicanus freak.
A few days before Christmas...</i>

1019
01:22:34,105 --> 01:22:38,201
<i>his eyes would begin to gleam
with a wild and ravenous light.</i>

1020
01:22:42,179 --> 01:22:46,479
Okay, Black Bart, now you get yours.

1021
01:23:00,464 --> 01:23:02,398
<i>Oh, my God! I shot my eye out!</i>

1022
01:23:02,566 --> 01:23:04,124
<i>You'll shoot your eye out, kid.</i>

1023
01:23:04,602 --> 01:23:08,868
<i>You'll shoot your eye out,
you'll shoot your eye out!</i>

1024
01:23:09,807 --> 01:23:13,004
Ralphie, you be careful out there.
Don't shoot your eye out!

1025
01:23:13,077 --> 01:23:15,136
<i>She hadn't seen! She didn't know!</i>

1026
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:18,374
<i>My eye's all right.
The BB must've hit my glasses.</i>

1027
01:23:19,784 --> 01:23:21,479
<i>My glasses! Oh, no!</i>

1028
01:23:21,552 --> 01:23:23,213
<i>Where are my glasses?</i>

1029
01:23:24,855 --> 01:23:27,619
<i>Few things brought such swift
and terrible retribution...</i>

1030
01:23:27,725 --> 01:23:30,694
<i>on a kid as a pair of busted glasses!</i>

1031
01:23:35,032 --> 01:23:36,294
Stop!

1032
01:23:48,512 --> 01:23:49,979
Oh, no!

1033
01:23:52,449 --> 01:23:54,713
<i>Oh, no! Pulverized.</i>

1034
01:24:06,597 --> 01:24:10,761
<i>For a moment I thought, I'll fake it.
They'll never know the lens is gone!</i>

1035
01:24:13,437 --> 01:24:16,270
<i>Randomly, my mind evolved
a spectacular plot.</i>

1036
01:24:16,473 --> 01:24:18,634
<i>Let's see, an icicle!</i>

1037
01:24:18,976 --> 01:24:21,342
<i>Falls off the garage and hits me in the eye!</i>

1038
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:25,877
<i>It would work. It had to work.
Quickly, I whipped up some tears.</i>

1039
01:24:32,156 --> 01:24:34,920
What's the matter, honey?
What happened?

1040
01:24:34,992 --> 01:24:36,220
What happened? Let me see that.

1041
01:24:36,293 --> 01:24:40,059
There was this icicle
and it fell off the garage and it hit me.

1042
01:24:44,435 --> 01:24:47,666
- What is it?
- No, it's okay. Just read your funnies.

1043
01:24:51,842 --> 01:24:53,332
Wake up, Randy.

1044
01:24:58,115 --> 01:24:59,446
Oh, God.

1045
01:24:59,617 --> 01:25:02,677
It hit my cheek and it broke my glasses.

1046
01:25:03,187 --> 01:25:06,884
And I tried to get out of the way, but I...

1047
01:25:08,826 --> 01:25:12,728
There, see, it's just a little bump.

1048
01:25:13,097 --> 01:25:14,758
You're lucky it didn't cut your eye.

1049
01:25:14,832 --> 01:25:16,959
Those icicles have been known
to kill people.

1050
01:25:23,207 --> 01:25:26,608
- What's going on up there?
- Nothing. We'll be right down.

1051
01:25:26,911 --> 01:25:29,573
You stay away from that turkey!
It's got an hour to cook.

1052
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:30,840
You'll get worms!

1053
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:37,510
But what about my glasses?

1054
01:25:38,088 --> 01:25:40,420
You can wear the old ones
with the crack in them...

1055
01:25:40,491 --> 01:25:42,322
until we get you some new ones.

1056
01:25:45,162 --> 01:25:47,062
<i>I had pulled it off!</i>

1057
01:25:48,465 --> 01:25:50,330
But I left my gun outside.

1058
01:25:51,635 --> 01:25:54,502
When you get dressed
you can go out and get your gun.

1059
01:25:54,705 --> 01:25:56,070
Hold that on there.

1060
01:25:56,573 --> 01:25:58,165
<i>Life is like that.</i>

1061
01:25:58,642 --> 01:26:03,579
<i>Sometimes at the height of our reveries,
when our joy is at its zenith...</i>

1062
01:26:03,681 --> 01:26:06,582
<i>when all is most right with the world...</i>

1063
01:26:06,717 --> 01:26:10,050
<i>the most unthinkable disasters
descend upon us.</i>

1064
01:26:25,502 --> 01:26:27,060
Oh, turkey!

1065
01:26:41,919 --> 01:26:45,116
Sons a bitches! Bumpuses!

1066
01:27:00,337 --> 01:27:03,932
<i>The heavenly aroma still hung heavy
in the house. But it was gone.</i>

1067
01:27:04,074 --> 01:27:07,100
<i>All gone. No turkey.
No turkey sandwiches.</i>

1068
01:27:07,177 --> 01:27:11,204
<i>No turkey salad. No turkey gravy,
turkey hash, turkey à la king...</i>

1069
01:27:11,315 --> 01:27:12,612
<i>or gallons of turkey soup.</i>

1070
01:27:12,683 --> 01:27:13,411
<i>Gone.</i>

1071
01:27:13,484 --> 01:27:14,746
<i>All gone.</i>

1072
01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:20,379
All right.

1073
01:27:20,858 --> 01:27:21,756
Everybody upstairs.

1074
01:27:21,992 --> 01:27:23,289
Get dressed.

1075
01:27:25,462 --> 01:27:26,952
We are going out to eat.

1076
01:27:51,255 --> 01:27:55,715
No! Not, "ra ra ra ra ra." "La la la la la."

1077
01:27:56,126 --> 01:27:56,922
Sing like this:

1078
01:28:05,369 --> 01:28:06,859
Try again.

1079
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,074
Stop!

1080
01:28:18,849 --> 01:28:20,612
Sing something else.

1081
01:28:34,198 --> 01:28:35,256
No!

1082
01:28:35,332 --> 01:28:36,424
Stop!

1083
01:28:37,301 --> 01:28:39,565
Kitchen. Bring food. For customers.

1084
01:28:48,712 --> 01:28:50,043
Oh, I'm sorry.

1085
01:28:52,883 --> 01:28:54,544
It's a beautiful duck.

1086
01:28:54,952 --> 01:28:56,613
It really is.

1087
01:28:57,421 --> 01:28:59,048
But you see...

1088
01:29:01,558 --> 01:29:02,354
What?

1089
01:29:02,426 --> 01:29:04,394
It's smiling at me.

1090
01:29:09,967 --> 01:29:11,059
Okay?

1091
01:29:12,469 --> 01:29:13,902
Beautiful!

1092
01:29:17,441 --> 01:29:19,466
<i>That Christmas would live
in our memories...</i>

1093
01:29:19,576 --> 01:29:23,012
<i>as the Christmas when
we were introduced to Chinese turkey.</i>

1094
01:29:24,448 --> 01:29:26,439
<i>All was right with the world.</i>

1095
01:29:47,404 --> 01:29:49,702
Oh, honey, come over here. Look at this.

1096
01:29:50,541 --> 01:29:52,509
Is that beautiful!

1097
01:30:38,455 --> 01:30:42,721
<i>Next to me in the blackness
lay my oiled blue-steel beauty.</i>

1098
01:30:43,493 --> 01:30:45,825
<i>The greatest Christmas gift
I had ever received...</i>

1099
01:30:45,929 --> 01:30:47,362
<i>or would ever receive.</i>

1100
01:30:48,532 --> 01:30:52,195
<i>Gradually, I drifted off to sleep,
pranging ducks on the wing...</i>

1101
01:30:52,269 --> 01:30:54,794
<i>and getting off spectacular hip shots.</i>
