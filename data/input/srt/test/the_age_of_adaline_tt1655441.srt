1
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:05,378
<i>On December 31st., two thousand fourteen,</i>

2
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,572
<i>a taxi cab traveled through San Francisco,</i>

3
00:01:09,293 --> 00:01:12,706
<i>from Chinatown to Marin.</i>

4
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:18,019
<i>The car carried a single passenger,</i>

5
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:23,254
<i>a woman, her birth name, Adaline Bowman,</i>

6
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:29,510
<i>current alias, Jennifer Larson.</i>

7
00:01:30,051 --> 00:01:35,072
<i>This is the first and last
chapter of her story.</i>

8
00:01:47,637 --> 00:01:51,783
Sorry, ya just gotta be quiet, my dad,
he's still sleeping, he works nights.

9
00:01:52,048 --> 00:01:53,347
C'mon in.

10
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:05,150
<i>I... uh... finished the color SAP
and the digital printing last night.</i>

11
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:09,056
<i>I pulled some line art from the internet,</i>

12
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,883
and printed the imperfections.

13
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:14,257
See, that's kinda my secret,
the dust marks and the discoloration.

14
00:02:14,308 --> 00:02:16,901
No one's gonna question
that detail in a million years.

15
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:22,692
<i>So, why 29? I mean, if I
were you, shave a coupla

16

years off, you could
</i> definitely get away with...

17
00:02:27,756 --> 00:02:29,879
You're very kind, Tony.

18
00:02:31,246 --> 00:02:32,832
Nice work.

19
00:02:33,168 --> 00:02:35,802
It's a pleasure doing business with you. If
you any of your friends ever need anything...

20
00:02:35,902 --> 00:02:37,829
- Why are you doing this?
- Come again?

21
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,052
You're a smart kid, forgery's a felony.

22
00:02:40,103 --> 00:02:43,079
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine,
six years in jail.

23
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:46,384
Shit, you're... you're a cop?

24
00:02:47,228 --> 00:02:50,319
No, I'm about as far from law
enforcement as you can get.

25
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:53,930
I just hate to see wasted potential, Jeff.

26
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:55,137
Tony. It's Tony.

27
00:02:55,187 --> 00:02:59,262
The autographed baseballs in
your bedroom... made out to Jeff.

28
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,787
Don't get sloppy,
it's the little things that trip you up.

29
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:29,534
Honey, I'm home.

30
00:03:37,456 --> 00:03:38,918
Reese?

31
00:03:42,094 --> 00:03:43,632
Hi!

32
00:03:59,453 --> 00:04:01,168
There we go.

33
00:04:02,112 --> 00:04:04,670
<i>You're gonna love the new farm house.</i>

34
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:08,775
Clean air, acres and acres of woods,
a mountain stream.

35
00:04:09,092 --> 00:04:10,915
You'll feel like a puppy again.

36
00:04:12,227 --> 00:04:16,699
Did you know that your great, great,
grandmother was born just a few towns over?

37
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:19,088
So was mine,
not at the same time, of course.

38
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:24,158
Oh, I gotta go to work.

39
00:04:26,108 --> 00:04:29,346
- Civic Archives, please.
- It may take a while, Market's jammed.

40
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:31,478
Okay, then please take
California to Hyde.

41
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,124
There's construction on Hyde.

42
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:36,159
Why don't you stay on this,
take this to Golf, Golf to Bush, Bush to.

43
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:39,476
Polk, Polk to Grove, and then just
leave me on the corner of Market.

44
00:04:40,634 --> 00:04:43,415
- You want my job?
- You never know.

45
00:05:03,065 --> 00:05:04,670
- Morning, Jennie.
- Morning.

46
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,033
- Morning.
- Hi, Kenneth.

47
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:09,670
We thought you might not be coming in
today, being New Year's Eve, and all.

48
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:14,101
Well, it's still a Wednesday,
the fun doesn't start 'til tonight anyway.

49
00:05:14,194 --> 00:05:16,875
Well, are you up for a
little excitement right now?

50
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:18,035
Sure, what is it?

51
00:05:18,082 --> 00:05:21,608
Your favorite, the newsreel archive,
it's finally being digitized.

52
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:24,535
We need a little help getting
it ready to be shipped.

53
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,377
I'd love to.

54
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:53,394
<i>Adaline Marie Bowman was born at twelve-oh-one
a.m., January 1st. Nineteen-oh-eight,</i>

55
00:06:53,444 --> 00:06:56,909
<i>at Children's Hospital, San Francisco,</i>

56
00:07:00,447 --> 00:07:03,454
<i>the only child of Faye and Milton Bowman,</i>

57
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:16,069
<i>On June 16th, 1929, just as Adaline Bowman and
her mother stopped to admire the expanse,</i>

58
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,711
<i>where three years hence construction would
be finished on the Golden Gate Bridge,</i>

59
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,490
<i>a young engineer displayed
uncommon gallantry.</i>

60
00:07:35,014 --> 00:07:40,779
<i>Eighty-seven days later Adaline
married Clarence James Prescott,</i>

61
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:44,834
<i>at Old Saint Mary's
Cathedral in San Francisco.</i>

62
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:52,887
<i>Three years later Adaline
gave birth to a baby girl.</i>

63
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:58,540
<i>They named her Fleming,
after Adaline's paternal grandmother.</i>

64
00:07:59,603 --> 00:08:05,964
<i>On February 17th, 1937 eight workers and two
engineers lost their lives when a section</i>

65
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:10,838
<i>of scaffolding fell through a safety net
during construction of the Golden Gate Bridge.</i>

66
00:08:11,675 --> 00:08:15,221
<i>Among the deceased was Adaline's husband.</i>

67
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:28,576
<i>Ten months after her husband's death
Adaline was driving north to her</i>

68
00:08:28,665 --> 00:08:34,561
<i>parents beach cottage where 5 year
old Fleming was waiting up for her,</i>

69
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:42,832
<i>when something highly unusual occurred,
something almost magical...</i>

70
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:51,683
<i>snow fell in Sonoma County, California.</i>

71
00:09:26,368 --> 00:09:32,147
<i>The immersion in the frigid water
caused Adaline's body to go into an</i>

72
00:09:32,235 --> 00:09:40,033
<i>anoxic reflex, instantly stopping her
breathing and slowing her heartbeat.</i>

73
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:45,202
<i>Within 2 minutes,
Adaline Bowman's core temperature</i>

74
00:09:45,394 --> 00:09:53,402
<i>had dropped to 87 degrees...
her heart stopped beating.</i>

75
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:07,615
<i>At 8:55 a bolt of lightning struck
the vehicle discharging half a</i>

76
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:12,908
<i>billion volts of electricity and
producing 60,000 amperes of current.</i>

77
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,452
<i>Its effect was threefold.</i>

78
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:21,229
<i>First, the charge defibrillated
Adaline Bowman's heart.</i>

79
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:28,088
<i>Second,
she was jolted out of her anoxic state</i>

80
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:33,086
<i>causing her to draw her
first breath in 2 minutes.</i>

81
00:10:46,966 --> 00:10:50,142
<i>Third, based on Von Lehman's principle of</i>

82
00:10:50,213 --> 00:10:53,967
<i>electron compression in
deoxyribonucleic acid,</i>

83
00:10:54,018 --> 00:10:57,692
<i>which will be discovered in the
year two thousand thirty-five,</i>

84
00:10:57,967 --> 00:11:03,711
<i>Adaline Bowman will henceforth be
immune to the ravages of time...</i>

85
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:08,975
<i>she will never age another day.</i>

86
00:11:34,703 --> 00:11:37,847
<i>As the years passed,
Adaline credited her unchanging</i>

87
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,700
<i>appearance to a combination
of a healthy diet,</i>

88
00:11:40,726 --> 00:11:43,261
<i>exercise, heredity, and good luck.</i>

89
00:11:43,363 --> 00:11:47,961
- Adaline?
- Miriam, hello.

90
00:11:48,062 --> 00:11:52,081
- My god, you haven't changed a bit.
- Oh, that's very kind of you to say.

91
00:11:52,182 --> 00:11:54,030
Fleming, you're all grown up.

92
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,573
That's what I keep telling my mom,
but she doesn't believe me.

93
00:11:57,052 --> 00:12:00,714
I'm sorry we really must leave.
But you... you look like sisters.

94
00:12:00,813 --> 00:12:02,799
You better stop or it'll
go straight to my head.

95
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:06,205
- How is that possible?
- A new face cream... from Paris.

96
00:12:06,306 --> 00:12:08,768
Made from the royal
jelly of the queen bee.

97
00:12:08,793 --> 00:12:11,591
Okay, Darling, bye-bye
now, great seeing you.

98
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:22,827
<i>Action was required... just weeks later,
when living a quiet suburban existence,</i>

99
00:12:22,927 --> 00:12:26,860
<i>Adaline was pulled over for
a minor traffic infraction.</i>

100
00:12:28,138 --> 00:12:31,980
Ma'am it says here you were
born January 1st., 1908.

101
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:34,645
That's right.

102
00:12:34,745 --> 00:12:40,374
- That would make you... 45 years old?
- Yes.

103
00:12:40,474 --> 00:12:42,371
Ma'am, I'm gonna hold onto this.

104
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:46,354
When you come by the station house to pick
it up, please bring your birth certificate.

105
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:50,409
I'd be happy to, Officer,
is tomorrow morning all right?

106
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:52,150
Sure.

107
00:12:54,764 --> 00:13:01,725
<i>Soon after, Adaline moved back to San Francisco and
took a clerical job at the School of Medicine.</i>

108
00:13:07,294 --> 00:13:13,745
<i>There, she availed herself of every
opportunity to research her condition.</i>

109
00:13:18,721 --> 00:13:24,308
<i>After a year of intense study,
Adaline Bowman was forced to confront the</i>

110
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:29,640
<i>fact that there was absolutely no
scientific explanation for her condition.</i>

111
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:36,274
<i>Are you a member of the communist party or have
you ever been a member of the communist party?</i>

112
00:13:46,014 --> 00:13:47,504
Adaline?

113
00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:51,678
I'm sorry, you have the wrong person.

114
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:55,114
We're from the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, Miss Bowman.

115
00:13:56,538 --> 00:13:58,741
We'd like to ask you a few questions,
if you don't mind.

116
00:13:58,786 --> 00:14:01,378
Why, I've done nothing wrong.

117
00:14:02,144 --> 00:14:05,427
I'm a good American, how dare you
bother me at my place of employment.

118
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:06,746
It couldn't be helped, Ma'am.

119
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:09,884
We have no record of your residence.
This way please.

120
00:14:16,543 --> 00:14:21,633
Nothing to worry about, Miss Bowman,
we're just going to run a few tests on you.

121
00:15:28,448 --> 00:15:34,860
If anyone contacts you, tell them that I went
to Europe on vacation, that I never came back.

122
00:15:35,743 --> 00:15:38,753
The next time we see each other,
I'll have a new identity.

123
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:44,273
I'll always be your mother, you'll just
have to introduce me as your friend.

124
00:15:44,374 --> 00:15:50,205
- Mama, no.
- It has to be this way... here.

125
00:16:01,207 --> 00:16:07,855
<i>To insure the freedom and safety of herself and
her daughter Adaline vowed to keep moving,</i>

126
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:15,216

and appearance every decade,</i>

127
00:16:17,282 --> 00:16:24,740
<i>and never to speak a word of

Hello, Regan.

133
00:17:05,865 --> 00:17:08,307
<i>Amanda, you're not going
to stand me up, are you?</i>

134
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:11,269
You asked me that last year,
why don't you trust me?

135
00:17:11,351 --> 00:17:13,692
Oh, I just can't believe you
haven't got a better offer.

136
00:17:13,762 --> 00:17:14,763
<i>Impossible.</i>

137
00:17:14,844 --> 00:17:15,998
I'll pick you up eight?

138
00:17:16,023 --> 00:17:18,482
Actually, that's the
other reason I called.

- Look at you.
- Have you ever been there for New Years?

141
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:26,826
Only once, ages ago.

142
00:17:26,935 --> 00:17:28,428
<i>I guess it's pretty lavish.</i>

143

Well, I better get to it then,
I'll see you soon.

144
00:17:32,912 --> 00:17:33,913
<i>Bye, Regan.</i>

145
00:17:54,534 --> 00:17:55,585
Are you hungry?

146
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:59,077
No?

00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:05,013
Sorry, buddy, it's a girls night.

149
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,750
Avery, if you do not remove the hand
my knee...

150
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:43,082
My two hands are on
the table, Adaline.

151
00:19:23,021 --> 00:19:24,022
Thank you.

152
00:19:25,575 --> 00:19:27,916
- Happy New Year.
- Oh! Hey, Amanda.

153
00:19:28,027 --> 00:19:30,839
- That was you clapping, wasn't it?
- How did you guess?

154
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,012
- You've got manners.
- We're the last two.

155
00:19:34,544 --> 00:19:36,095
Hey, grab a glass.

156
00:19:36,826 --> 00:19:38,337
Tell me, what did I miss?

157
00:19:38,407 --> 00:19:40,599
Oh, not much, just some happy chatter.

158
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,451
It's funny, no matter how old you get,

159
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:46,085
New Year's Eve still feels like the
one night where anything's possible.

160
00:19:46,204 --> 00:19:47,576
What's your resolution?

161
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:50,890
Same as always, true love.
How about you?

162
00:19:51,611 --> 00:19:54,242
To live this year as
though it were my last.

163
00:19:54,252 --> 00:19:56,295
Well, you never know,
it could be, at our age.

164
00:19:56,836 --> 00:19:59,288
So, Helia, let's live.

165
00:20:03,082 --> 00:20:06,075
Beware, bachelor at three o'clock,
we need to stir him up.

166
00:20:06,184 --> 00:20:07,266
What's he like?

167
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:09,608
Brown hair, icy blues,
mid-30's.

168
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:12,000
How many with you who is
kicking out my babies?

169
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,971
He's here.

170
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:15,644
- Good evening, ladies.
- Welcome to Cougartown.

171
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:19,878
I know, we don't look a day over 28,
you're too kind. What's your name?

172
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:22,121
- Dale... Davenport.
- Dale's a painter.

173
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,952
- Really?
- Yeah, a starving artist, though.

174
00:20:23,962 --> 00:20:26,465
<i>Because he doesn't accept</i>
his affluent family's help.

175
00:20:26,536 --> 00:20:28,086
I... I'm sorry, have we met?

176
00:20:28,196 --> 00:20:31,871
No, no, no, just your Cartier wrist watch,
one of the very first.

177
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,365
I'm assuming it was given to you by
a well to do grandfather.

178
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:38,688
A great-grandfather,
but how do you know I paint?

179
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:41,961
You hands are covered in paint.
<i>That one was easy.</i>

180
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:46,675
Well, Picasso, have a seat,
we're gonna buy you a drink.

181
00:20:47,532 --> 00:20:48,534
Sure.

182
00:20:48,557 --> 00:20:50,549
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

183
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,661
Thank you.

184
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:31,199
<i>Six, five, four...</i>

185
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,042
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

186
00:21:34,073 --> 00:21:37,311
<i>Happy New Year!</i>

187
00:21:39,808 --> 00:21:40,829
Hello.

188
00:21:41,371 --> 00:21:43,423
Thank you, Sweetheart.

189
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,287
No, no, you don't have to sing.

190
00:21:48,397 --> 00:21:50,910
Please, please, don't sing,
I've already had enough birthdays.

191
00:21:53,082 --> 00:21:54,083
Where are you?

192
00:21:55,644 --> 00:21:57,296
You didn't go out at all?

193
00:21:58,357 --> 00:22:00,430
Well, I don't blame you.

194
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,422
Are we still on for tomorrow?

195
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:06,395
Great, all right, get some sleep.
I love you.

196
00:22:07,056 --> 00:22:08,096
Good night.

197
00:22:19,528 --> 00:22:21,971
Whoever he is,
I hope he has one helluva an excuse.

198
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:23,893
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

199
00:22:24,753 --> 00:22:26,635
It's just...
isn't there some sort of tradition.

200
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:30,219
If you're alone on New Year Eve that
you're supposed to kiss a stranger?

201
00:22:31,711 --> 00:22:33,732
Damn it, you've heard it before.

202
00:22:33,843 --> 00:22:38,655
Just once, from a young
Bing Crosby... type.

203
00:22:39,218 --> 00:22:40,219
Happy New Year.

204
00:22:48,688 --> 00:22:52,141
- I am too old for this.
- Oh, no, don't disappear.

205
00:22:52,221 --> 00:22:54,703
I'll call you tomorrow and you can tell
me everything I missed. I love you.

206
00:22:54,713 --> 00:22:56,214
Bye, Beautiful.

207
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:12,090
That'll teach me not to put my
hand where it doesn't belong.

208
00:23:12,922 --> 00:23:14,044
Something tells me it won't.

209
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:19,883
You know, that was a risky move.

210
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:20,527
What was?

211
00:23:20,553 --> 00:23:22,926
Not introducing yourself
before you leave.

212
00:23:23,873 --> 00:23:24,884
I'm a daredevil.

213
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,407
I'm Ellis, a pleasure to meet you.

214
00:23:28,518 --> 00:23:31,590
- Like the Island?
- No man is.

215
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:33,462
I'm Jenny.

216
00:23:33,982 --> 00:23:34,983
The poem?

217
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,616
No?
"Say I'm weary, say I'm sad,".

218
00:23:39,729 --> 00:23:43,583
"Say that health and wealth have miss'd me,
Say I'm growing old, but add,."

219
00:23:43,883 --> 00:23:46,580
"Jenny kissed me."

220
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:51,330
Who wrote that?

221
00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:54,753
- Oh, one of the romantics, I think.
- No, you're not sure.

222
00:23:55,545 --> 00:23:59,929
Actually, I am, but I don't want
to come across like a know-it-all.

223
00:24:00,048 --> 00:24:02,902
Too bad, Henri, I adore know-it-alls.

224
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:09,258
So, where are you off to?

225
00:24:10,028 --> 00:24:12,842
Some place better food...
my apartment.

226
00:24:14,292 --> 00:24:15,294
And yourself?

227
00:24:16,134 --> 00:24:20,579
Back to the party.
I just wanted to spend 27 floors with you.

228
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:23,932
- Well, that was a risky move.
- What?

229
00:24:24,624 --> 00:24:27,616
Leaving your date upstairs.
I hope it was worth it.

230
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:28,829
What are you talking about?

231
00:24:28,855 --> 00:24:30,815
Oh, come on, that
beautiful woman in blue.

232
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,472
Does her name happen to end in "kova"?

233
00:24:34,483 --> 00:24:38,337
No, her name is Agnes Boggs.

234
00:24:38,448 --> 00:24:40,970
Her uncle's the chef,
I'll let him know you liked his food.

235
00:24:42,602 --> 00:24:43,903
And she's not my date.

236
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:53,059
- Taxi, Ma'am?
- Yes, please, thank you.

237
00:24:57,926 --> 00:24:59,008
Good night.

238
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,290
I'll just wait with you.

239
00:25:02,402 --> 00:25:04,513
So you can find out where I live?

240
00:25:06,184 --> 00:25:08,267
It does make it a lot
easier to send flowers.

241
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,811
Thank you, but I'll manage.

242
00:25:15,484 --> 00:25:18,007
Goodbye, it's been an
adventure meeting you.

243
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:22,612
Thank you.

244
00:25:24,683 --> 00:25:25,684
Wait!

245
00:25:27,155 --> 00:25:30,569
There you go again, putting your
hand in places it doesn't belong.

246
00:25:32,171 --> 00:25:35,912
- How do we get in touch?
- Happy New Year, Ellis.

247
00:25:36,306 --> 00:25:37,567
Thank you, Sir.

248
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,673
- Am I late?
- No more than usual.

249
00:26:05,694 --> 00:26:06,776
Happy Birthday, Mama.

250
00:26:07,696 --> 00:26:08,698
Thank you, Darling.

251
00:26:11,401 --> 00:26:13,413
I'm so happy to see you.

252
00:26:17,457 --> 00:26:19,519
You know you don't have
to still give me cards.

253
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,634
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

254
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:29,388
- So, when you are moving back up?
- The third week in February.

255
00:26:29,499 --> 00:26:31,259
- Right on schedule.
- Of course.

256
00:26:38,057 --> 00:26:40,356
I see you already forgot our
little talk about sodium.

257
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:43,623
No, I am simply choosing to ignore it.

258
00:26:46,945 --> 00:26:52,561
Actually, I'm thinking of moving, myself.

259
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:55,994
But you love where you live.

260
00:26:56,174 --> 00:26:59,127
I do, but, you know,
there's just too many stairs.

261
00:26:59,778 --> 00:27:05,284
Last week Kay Alfonso fell,
and she broke her hip.

262
00:27:05,365 --> 00:27:08,498
The doctor said she might
never leave the hospital.

263
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:13,932
And the very next day,
Molly Andrews called me,

264
00:27:14,012 --> 00:27:19,568
and she told me about this wonderful
retirement community in Arizona.

265
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:23,515
She moved in last spring. She said she's
never been happier in her whole life.

266
00:27:27,436 --> 00:27:28,587
What's a matter?

267
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:34,113
We bought in Oregon so
that I could be close to you.

268
00:27:34,943 --> 00:27:36,455
You could come up for long visits,

269
00:27:36,566 --> 00:27:38,617
move in with me eventually.

270
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:43,712
We haven't lived together
since I was in high school.

271
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:46,486
A little bit.
You're not getting any younger.

272
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:50,249
What if you move to Arizona
and something happened to you?

273
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:51,351
What if you get sick?

274
00:27:52,131 --> 00:27:55,305
Then, I would hope that you'd
come and take care of me.

275
00:27:59,388 --> 00:28:00,663
What if I'm too late?

276
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:07,507
No, no, we cannot do this,
not on your birthday, it's a holiday.

277
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:16,605
I nearly fell off my feet.

278
00:28:16,705 --> 00:28:18,220
What are you two clucking about?

279
00:28:18,357 --> 00:28:21,271
Major news!
Mr. Jones is donating fifty thousand

280
00:28:21,323 --> 00:28:24,282
dollars worth of first edition
classics to this library.

281
00:28:24,354 --> 00:28:26,615
- What books, do you know?
- We're going to find out very soon,

282
00:28:26,695 --> 00:28:31,130
because his office called to say
that he'll be here to deliver them himself.

283
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:34,943
- Hi.
- Oh no. - I'm Ellis. - Oh, good.

284
00:28:34,983 --> 00:28:37,134
- Welcome, - Thanks.
- Mr. Jones.

285
00:28:37,184 --> 00:28:40,365
On behalf of the San
Francisco Heritage Society

286
00:28:40,414 --> 00:28:44,923
I'd like to express our sincere
gratitude for your most generous gift.

287
00:28:45,013 --> 00:28:47,626
I left them in Shipping and Receiving,
but I'm sure they'll be right up.

288
00:28:47,707 --> 00:28:51,230
If you don't mind, we'd like
a photograph of you donating the books.

289
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,432
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

290
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:54,713
Can you give me one second, though?

291
00:28:57,326 --> 00:29:02,080
Hey, it's me, the know-it-all.

292
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:05,724
- What are you doing here?
- I got something for you, too.

293
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,657
Some flowers.

294
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:13,343
<u>Daisy Miller</u> by Henry James.

295
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:15,904
<u>Dandelion Wine</u> by Ray Bradbury.

296
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:18,728
<u>White Oleander</u>, Janet Fitch.

297
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,940
Very clever.

298
00:29:25,114 --> 00:29:27,165
How did you know I work here?

299
00:29:27,276 --> 00:29:30,619
I just joined the Board,
I saw you coming out of our meeting.

300
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,792
You could have mentioned
that in the elevator.

301
00:29:37,215 --> 00:29:41,750
If we'd met in a taller building,
I'd of had time to cover that.

302
00:29:45,724 --> 00:29:49,398
I don't know about you, but...
I'm ready for some donating.

303
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:52,211
Great, I'll be here.

304
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:55,805
No way, I'd like for you to accept
books on behalf of the Library.

305
00:29:55,924 --> 00:29:58,387
- Oh, no, I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

306
00:29:58,458 --> 00:30:00,779
No, I... I don't want my photo taken.

307
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,461
Don't worry, you look stunning.

308
00:30:02,582 --> 00:30:05,785
It's not about vanity, I just don't
like people taking my photograph.

309
00:30:08,317 --> 00:30:11,810
Suit yourself, if you won't accept them,
I won't donate 'em.

310
00:30:11,931 --> 00:30:15,785
- You wouldn't do that.
- I will, I'll even have a book burning.

311
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:22,313
I just... I don't like having
my photos taken, Ellis.

312
00:30:23,903 --> 00:30:26,496
Okay, fine, fine. Here's an alternative.

313
00:30:27,957 --> 00:30:29,238
Let me take you out tomorrow.

314
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,763
Okay... that's impossible.

315
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:43,502
All right, well, I'll just pack
up the books then, that's fine.

316
00:30:47,086 --> 00:30:48,669
Where?

317
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,833
Some place you've never been.

318
00:30:55,074 --> 00:30:57,846
Well, if it's in this city,
that's unlikely.

319
00:30:59,127 --> 00:31:00,557
Try me.

320
00:31:02,751 --> 00:31:04,914
<i>You can leave your boots at
the front when you're done,</i>

321
00:31:04,943 --> 00:31:07,369
- I'll be right outside.
- We will, thank you, Tom.

322
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:08,557
All right.

323
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:14,854
All right... I give up.

324
00:31:17,026 --> 00:31:22,612
In the first year of the Gold Rush, about
60,000 people came to San Francisco by ship.

325
00:31:22,721 --> 00:31:26,605
And a lot of them hightailed straight
into the hills leaving their boats behind.

326
00:31:27,226 --> 00:31:30,259
Hundreds of boats were left onshore.

327
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:34,653
Downtown San Francisco was
built right on top of them.

328
00:31:34,763 --> 00:31:35,765
I didn't know that.

329
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:41,840
Now... City Services found this when they were
digging when they were digging for a utility line.

330
00:31:43,393 --> 00:31:47,292
- My God.
- Isn't it something?

331
00:31:48,377 --> 00:31:50,819
- Is... is that...?
- Yeah, that's a boat.

332
00:31:51,381 --> 00:31:55,884
Oh! Wow! This is incredible.

333
00:31:56,005 --> 00:31:58,819
So, we had the digging stopped immediately,
of course, because

334
00:31:58,869 --> 00:32:01,480
we want this made
available to the public.

335
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,277
- "We"

336
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:05,207
- San Francisco Historical
Preservation Society.

337
00:32:05,284 --> 00:32:07,317
Oh, let me guess, you're on the board.

338
00:32:07,396 --> 00:32:10,579
Yeah, well, they'll...
they'll let anyone on the Board these days.

339
00:32:18,988 --> 00:32:22,151
So, how did you come by
your fortune, anyway... inheritance?

340
00:32:22,912 --> 00:32:27,096
Luck.
I was a math major in college, and

341
00:32:27,175 --> 00:32:31,029
in my spare time I developed an
algorithm for analyzing climate data,

342
00:32:31,711 --> 00:32:36,445
but my roommate figured out that it could
also be used to make economic forecasts.

343
00:32:36,556 --> 00:32:39,067
So he started a company in our dorm room,

344
00:32:39,147 --> 00:32:43,573
<i>sold it 3 years later and then
with his half he retired to Fiji.</i>

345
00:32:43,682 --> 00:32:46,895
And with my half, I'm...
ya know, I'm doing this.

346
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,097
Your... your job is giving away money.

347
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:52,632
Yeah, that's right, but... but if you want to
make a real difference in this world, it's a...

348
00:32:52,741 --> 00:32:55,585
it's a lot harder than it seems.

349
00:32:58,197 --> 00:33:00,098
What about you, Jenny?

350
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:08,136
I own a dog.

351
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:11,019
Well.

352
00:33:11,641 --> 00:33:13,071
I should be getting back.

353
00:33:13,663 --> 00:33:14,973
I thought we were having lunch.

354
00:33:16,224 --> 00:33:19,778
It's too late, Ellis,
I only have an hour.

355
00:33:23,992 --> 00:33:25,865
Let me at least walk you back.

356
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,973
Thank you for all of this, but..
But you should know I'm moving.

357
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:45,835
I have an idea.
I'll tell you a joke, and if you laugh,

358
00:33:46,645 --> 00:33:49,268
you have to go out with me
one more again before you move away.

359
00:33:49,348 --> 00:33:53,742
And if you don't laugh, I'll know we're
incompatible and I'll gladly give up.

360
00:33:53,853 --> 00:33:57,317
- That must be one helluva joke.
- It's the funniest in human history.

361
00:33:57,386 --> 00:34:01,391
But it's subtle, sophisticated,
so you probably won't even get it.

362
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,192
Yeah, probably not.

363
00:34:04,143 --> 00:34:05,144
Do you like baseball?

364
00:34:05,805 --> 00:34:07,997
- Yeah, I love it.
- Good. So...

365
00:34:09,177 --> 00:34:14,483
One day at Fenway Park,
Ted Williams... Do you know who he was?

366
00:34:14,563 --> 00:34:18,885
Oh, c'mon, the Thumper,
current batting average .344, right?

367
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:21,331
What? Yeah, that Ted Williams.

368
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,742
Anyway, so, he's hangin' around Fenway and

369
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:26,766
this horse walks up and says,
"I want to play for the Sox."

370
00:34:26,766 --> 00:34:28,807
- An actual horse?
- An actual horse.

371
00:34:28,947 --> 00:34:30,969
Ted's like, "Okay, what can you do?"

372
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,943
And the horse says, "I can hit just
like you, only a whole lot better ".

373
00:34:34,052 --> 00:34:38,007
So, he picks up the bat with
his teeth and Ted's like, "Okay",

374
00:34:38,257 --> 00:34:40,219
and he throws him a few,
and sure enough...

375
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:41,650
goong, goong, goong!

376
00:34:43,211 --> 00:34:44,262
Into the bleachers.

377
00:34:45,103 --> 00:34:48,807
So, Ted's like,
"Whoa! What else can you do?"

378
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,019
And the horse says,
"Well, I can play shortstop."

379
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:54,387
So, Ted hits him a few
ground balls and sure enough.

380
00:34:54,487 --> 00:34:56,385
He's a "vacuum cleaner"?

381
00:34:57,554 --> 00:35:01,050
Yeah, so Ted's like,
"Whoa! Can you pitch?"

382
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,733
And the horse just
looks at him and says,

383
00:35:02,831 --> 00:35:06,356
"Pitch? Who ever heard
of a horse pitching?"

384
00:35:12,572 --> 00:35:14,929
Yeah! Yes!

385
00:35:14,954 --> 00:35:19,989
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Lady has been conquered.

386
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,213
That's the worst joke I've
ever heard in my entire life.

387
00:35:24,324 --> 00:35:26,275
- Thank you.
- It wasn't a compliment.

388
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:29,949
Dinner, Tuesday, my place, 303-18th Street.

389
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,402
Eight o'clock.

390
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,833
Fine.

391
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:48,827
<i>Good morning, Miss Larson,
good to see you again.</i>

392
00:35:48,907 --> 00:35:51,451
<i>- Good morning.
- So, what can we do for you today?</i>

393
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,643
I'd like to add another
signee to my account.

394
00:35:53,753 --> 00:35:57,175
- May I ask the reason?
- I'll be traveling for a while.

395
00:35:57,867 --> 00:35:59,027
Traveling, huh?

396
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:03,052
Okay, I'll get the paperwork,
I'll be right back.

397
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:19,918
All of these companies
rate very highly with us.

398
00:36:20,028 --> 00:36:22,101
What's this, the Haloid
Photographic Company?

399
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:25,023
They've been around 50 years,
they make photo paper and equipment.

400
00:36:25,153 --> 00:36:28,056
They're developing something called
"electro photography".

401
00:36:28,117 --> 00:36:31,740
Could revolutionize the business,
but you won't see any immediate returns.

402
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:34,023
- Could be a few years away.
- That's all right.

403
00:36:34,753 --> 00:36:36,585
I'd hate to see you tie up your money.

404
00:36:37,306 --> 00:36:38,608
I'm patient.

405
00:36:39,548 --> 00:36:41,190
What do you know,
they changed their name.

406
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,601
They're now called...

407
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:47,376
What the heck, it starts
with an "X", it's...

408
00:36:48,036 --> 00:36:50,309
It's Greek, it's pronounced "XEROX".

409
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,661
Xerox.

410
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:57,327
<i>So, we can start with the signature card.</i>

411
00:36:58,847 --> 00:37:01,510
- What is the name of the co-signer?
- Susan Fleisher.

412
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:07,085
- Susan, what, F-I-e...
- I-s-h-e-r.

413
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:11,039
Now, I made you some salmon.

414
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,005
This no eating nonsense just won't
do if you are a proper farm dog.

415
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:20,088
I want you to eat every last bite,
do you understand me?

416
00:37:22,521 --> 00:37:25,273
Oh, there we go.

417
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:54,634
Hello? Ellis?

418
00:37:59,398 --> 00:38:01,760
- Am I interrupting?
- Hey!

419
00:38:03,313 --> 00:38:07,065
- I was afraid you got cold feet.
- No, no, just trouble getting a cab.

420
00:38:07,836 --> 00:38:08,838
- Hey.
- Hi.

421
00:38:12,422 --> 00:38:13,922
Can I take your coat?

422
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,706
Okay.

423
00:38:18,427 --> 00:38:21,722
Uh, your... your place it's, uh...

424
00:38:21,851 --> 00:38:23,972
- Unfinished?
- Yes!

425
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:27,686
Uh, I noticed that part,
it's sort of an artistic choice?

426
00:38:28,643 --> 00:38:32,612
No, I have to paint and plaster
and do all the wiring stuff,

427
00:38:32,672 --> 00:38:37,867
but I'm doing it all myself, so,
it's gonna take a little while.

428
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,938
- I think your food is burning.
- Ah!

429
00:38:44,137 --> 00:38:46,626
So, make yourself comfortable.

430
00:38:47,215 --> 00:38:48,427
<i>Sit down, relax.</i>

431
00:38:50,268 --> 00:38:51,302
Okay.

432
00:38:54,753 --> 00:38:57,856
What is it... that you're cooking?

433
00:38:58,418 --> 00:39:02,811
Well, it's a delicacy,
which to be honest, is not for everyone.

434
00:39:05,074 --> 00:39:06,376
I hope you like it.

435
00:39:08,126 --> 00:39:10,168
- Are you ready?
- Would you like a drum roll?

436
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:13,523
<i>Voila!</i>

437
00:39:14,873 --> 00:39:17,467
It was between this
and stuffed quail.

438
00:39:17,907 --> 00:39:19,389
Please do not tell me
you're disappointed.

439
00:39:19,498 --> 00:39:22,931
- I... I'm truly overjoyed!
- Yes!

440
00:39:23,983 --> 00:39:25,394
- Dig in.
- Okay.

441
00:39:30,248 --> 00:39:31,034
Well?

442
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:34,197
Well, it's perfect, just
the music is painful.

443
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:38,418
- You don't like jazz?
- No, I love jazz, this is something else.

444
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:45,795
My mom grew up in Maine,
she's is a real New Englander.

445
00:39:45,804 --> 00:39:48,657
Sweet, but tough as nails.

446
00:39:49,918 --> 00:39:55,974
My dad, on the other hand...
has his head in the stars... literally.

447
00:39:56,175 --> 00:39:59,568
He's an astronomer,
just retired from Stanford.

448
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:04,083
His claim to fame was that he
discovered an unusual comet.

449
00:40:04,384 --> 00:40:06,224
Unusual, in what way?

450
00:40:06,326 --> 00:40:09,056
Well, it has a mathematically
proven perigee.

451
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:14,041
So, based on his calculation, it will
pass by Earth in the winter of 1981.

452
00:40:14,643 --> 00:40:16,516
- Did it?
- No.

453
00:40:16,775 --> 00:40:23,385
No, it did not, but, that didn't stop
him from looking for it every year.

454
00:40:23,452 --> 00:40:26,617
It was a kind of ritual we
had when I was growing up.

455
00:40:27,887 --> 00:40:29,619
My dad is still looking.

456
00:40:33,132 --> 00:40:36,365
Well, one more glass of
wine and may see it.

457
00:40:38,518 --> 00:40:40,409
Oh, no, no, no thank you, please.

458
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:43,442
Ah, c'mon, ya know, they
have a saying in Italy,

459
00:40:43,543 --> 00:40:47,387
Anni, amori e bicchieri di vino,
nun se contano mai.

460
00:40:48,217 --> 00:40:52,351
"Years, lovers, wine cups,"

461
00:40:52,931 --> 00:40:55,773
"years, lovers and glasses or wine,"

462
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:58,447
"these are things that
should never be counted."

463
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,231
You have no idea.

464
00:41:07,827 --> 00:41:12,782
- I like your view.
- Thank you.

465
00:41:14,893 --> 00:41:16,606
I like the way you read.

466
00:41:18,668 --> 00:41:19,668
What?

467
00:41:20,148 --> 00:41:23,793
The first time I saw you, coming out
of a board meeting, you were reading.

468
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:29,938
Your hair was pulled back and
you were wearing a blue dress.

469
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,811
It was a book in Braille.
I slowed down to watch.

470
00:41:33,913 --> 00:41:35,625
How long did you watch for?

471
00:41:35,824 --> 00:41:38,246
Long enough to realize
you weren't blind.

472
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:40,769
And I had to meet you.

473
00:41:41,269 --> 00:41:45,244
And I didn't know when
or how, but I... I knew I would.

474
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:56,996
I think I, uh...

475
00:41:58,487 --> 00:42:00,068
I think I remember that day, uh...

476
00:42:02,322 --> 00:42:05,335
Yes, it was a... it was
a book in Norwegian,

477
00:42:05,344 --> 00:42:07,532
and because of all the
umlauts over the vowels,

478
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:09,563
it made it nearly
impossible to comprehend.

479
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,157
- You're kidding.
- Yes.

480
00:42:13,492 --> 00:42:15,565
- Are you kidding?
- Yes, yes of course I am.

481
00:42:16,786 --> 00:42:20,889
It was Braille for beginners,
or nursery rhymes or something.

482
00:42:27,989 --> 00:42:30,201
You could tell me anything
you want and I'll believe it.

483
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,751
I know almost nothing about you.

484
00:42:35,347 --> 00:42:36,780
It's better this way.

485
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,340
No... it's not.

486
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:07,916
Tell me something I can hold
on to forever and never let go.

487
00:43:14,233 --> 00:43:16,581
Let go.

488
00:44:04,389 --> 00:44:05,391
Hi.

489
00:44:07,969 --> 00:44:09,012
Good morning.

490
00:44:13,293 --> 00:44:17,298
Okay, move your arm,
some of us work for a living.

491
00:44:18,925 --> 00:44:22,885
Um, okay, I get it,
you're holding me hostage.

492
00:44:26,851 --> 00:44:28,324
Will you ever come back?

493
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:40,496
Are you sure there's no one there
who speaks English, or even Spanish?

494
00:44:40,782 --> 00:44:42,574
No, no, no, we... we want it all.

495
00:44:43,197 --> 00:44:45,333
Il curator compare...

496
00:44:45,652 --> 00:44:47,317
- I have to go.
- Hold on, hold on.

497
00:44:47,429 --> 00:44:48,465
One minute, please.

498
00:44:48,514 --> 00:44:52,114
Give me a second, okay,
I'm trying to deal this in Portuguese.

499
00:44:52,244 --> 00:44:53,244
I can't right now.

500
00:44:55,954 --> 00:44:57,045
What are you trying to say?

501
00:44:57,161 --> 00:45:00,726
The Rain Forest Trust
Fund's to buy 5,000 acres.

502
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,344
Huh, well, you're not even close.

503
00:45:02,893 --> 00:45:04,695
- Here.
- Thank you.

504
00:45:05,416 --> 00:45:08,858
We're confirming the purchase
of 5,000 acres, we good?

505
00:45:10,715 --> 00:45:12,576
The check is in the mail.

506
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:15,496
Thank you very much, Sir.

507
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:17,119
I'm late for work.

508
00:45:17,146 --> 00:45:19,780
- Wait. That's it?
- Let go.

509
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:57,333
<i>It's a $1.50, Ma'am.</i>

510
00:46:07,586 --> 00:46:08,588
<i>Ma'am?</i>

511
00:46:08,612 --> 00:46:10,990
I just changed my mind,
just keep driving please.

512
00:46:11,681 --> 00:46:12,681
You got it.

513
00:47:07,603 --> 00:47:08,605
Reese.

514
00:47:09,237 --> 00:47:10,572
Reese?

515
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,494
Baby, are you okay?

516
00:47:23,831 --> 00:47:25,056
Are you okay, Baby?

517
00:47:27,309 --> 00:47:32,663
<i>His urean creatine levels are way too high,
which means his kidneys are failing.</i>

518
00:47:32,713 --> 00:47:35,552
<i>The toxins are building up
and his body can't handle it.</i>

519
00:47:36,351 --> 00:47:40,864
- Is he in pain?
- It's difficult to say.

520
00:47:42,099 --> 00:47:44,335
If you were me,
what would you do?

521
00:47:49,393 --> 00:47:55,117
I'd be thinking about...
what a wonderful life he's had,

522
00:47:57,293 --> 00:47:59,492
how lucky you are to
have found each other.

523
00:48:09,949 --> 00:48:12,577
May I have a moment
alone with him, please?

524
00:48:13,195 --> 00:48:14,195
Of course.

525
00:48:51,739 --> 00:48:55,378
<i>Hey Jenny! This is Ellis.
I tried you a couple of times.</i>

526
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,789
<i>Hope you got my messages.
Call me back.</i>

527
00:50:57,115 --> 00:50:58,117
Jenny!

528
00:51:00,329 --> 00:51:01,431
What are you doing here?

529
00:51:02,831 --> 00:51:05,474
- Well, I tried to call, but...
- How did you get my address?

530
00:51:08,126 --> 00:51:09,128
The library.

531
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:14,403
Come on, don't be upset,
I didn't know what else to do.

532
00:51:19,186 --> 00:51:21,130
My dog, I had to...

533
00:51:21,972 --> 00:51:25,378
- I had to put him down.
- Oh, no, I'm so sorry to hear that.

534
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:27,827
You should have waited
for me to contact you.

535
00:51:27,896 --> 00:51:28,760
Uh, Jenny, there's...

536
00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:30,882
There's a reason I don't
give out my address.

537
00:51:31,445 --> 00:51:35,188
- I'm... I'm sorry, honestly.
- This isn't going to work, I'm moving.

538
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,009
Are you serious?

539
00:51:41,168 --> 00:51:42,913
Hi... for you.

540
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,594
<i>Barbara Ireland before
she moved to Florida,</i>

541
00:52:06,521 --> 00:52:08,465
she got rid of all her books.

542
00:52:09,762 --> 00:52:12,351
I could no sooner get rid
of this book than I could...

543
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:21,362
Well, it looks like I'm not
the only one getting nostalgic.

544
00:52:22,592 --> 00:52:24,543
You've had such a wonderful life.

545
00:52:25,163 --> 00:52:26,996
I like to think so.

546
00:52:28,994 --> 00:52:33,719
I just wish you... you know, that she
could have been there for more of it.

547
00:52:34,503 --> 00:52:35,585
So do I.

548
00:52:39,329 --> 00:52:40,331
Remember that?

549
00:52:40,762 --> 00:52:43,960
Nineteen fifty-four I
was junior in college.

550
00:52:44,608 --> 00:52:46,413
That's the last photo I have of you.

551
00:52:47,059 --> 00:52:49,108
Well, when you've seen one,
you've seen 'em all.

552
00:52:49,813 --> 00:52:51,014
This is true.

553
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,280
What is it?

554
00:53:00,601 --> 00:53:01,885
What's wrong?

555
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:04,565
I'm just tired of running,

556
00:53:06,585 --> 00:53:11,362
- of lying to good people.
- Then stop.

557
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:14,717
Nobody's chasing you anymore.

558
00:53:15,396 --> 00:53:18,418
Anyone who was ever been
suspicious is long dead.

559
00:53:19,213 --> 00:53:21,938
You don't have to be alone forever.

560
00:53:22,603 --> 00:53:25,268
Don't you miss having someone to love?

561
00:53:25,882 --> 00:53:27,905
It's been such a long time.

562
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,210
It's not the same when there's no future.

563
00:53:30,327 --> 00:53:32,490
What are you talkin' about,
you got nothin' but future!

564
00:53:32,597 --> 00:53:36,307
I mean a future together,
growing old together.

565
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,117
Without that, love is, uh...

566
00:53:41,123 --> 00:53:44,574
- it's just heartbreak.
- It's the same for everybody.

567
00:53:45,952 --> 00:53:48,449
How many times has
my heart been broken?

568
00:53:48,577 --> 00:53:49,577
Too many.

569
00:53:50,139 --> 00:53:54,905
If I had your looks and your energy,
I'd fall in love tomorrow, I really would.

570
00:53:56,284 --> 00:53:59,436
- I did meet someone.
- What?

571
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,777
Oh, on New Year's Eve,
he... he jumped on my elevator.

572
00:54:02,849 --> 00:54:03,771
Why didn't you tell me?

573
00:54:03,797 --> 00:54:05,717
Because I knew you'd
look at me like that.

574
00:54:07,364 --> 00:54:12,114
Don't get too excited,
I, uh... I told him to leave me alone.

575
00:54:13,028 --> 00:54:16,047
I was horrible... cruel.

576
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:19,244
Tell him you're sorry,
tell him you made a mistake.

577
00:54:19,766 --> 00:54:21,244
I can't, I'm leaving.

578
00:54:21,922 --> 00:54:25,202
You're moving to Oregon,
not Timbuktu.

579
00:54:27,262 --> 00:54:31,824
Come on, if you won't do it for yourself,
do it for me.

580
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:34,032
Please?

581
00:54:45,804 --> 00:54:47,400
- Hello.
- Can I help you?

582
00:54:48,192 --> 00:54:52,090
Uh, I'm here to see Ellis Jones,
he's not expecting me.

583
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:54,820
Well, let's see what we can do about that.

584
00:54:56,164 --> 00:54:57,164
And you are?

585
00:54:58,733 --> 00:55:00,065
Incredibly sorry.

586
00:55:01,554 --> 00:55:03,795
Mr. Jones, you got a guest down here.

587
00:55:04,454 --> 00:55:07,230
- I bet you got a name.
- Jennifer Larson.

588
00:55:08,527 --> 00:55:12,556
Please, tell him I understand
if he doesn't want to see me.

589
00:55:12,626 --> 00:55:14,547
I'm here just to say I'm sorry,

590
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:19,048
<i>and that my... my life
has been</i> unbelievable,

591
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:22,077
since longer than he can imagine,

592
00:55:22,186 --> 00:55:25,795
and I just... I was emotional
the other day, and...

593
00:55:27,134 --> 00:55:30,782
Now that I realize how
incredibly kind to me he's been,

594
00:55:30,833 --> 00:55:33,728
and I... I... I've just been
too stupid to accept it, and...

595
00:55:33,846 --> 00:55:35,853
I know better now, and... and

596
00:55:36,623 --> 00:55:39,755
that's why I want to tell
him how sincerely sorry I am.

597
00:55:41,498 --> 00:55:42,304
Okay.

598
00:55:42,331 --> 00:55:45,556
And ask that... if he could
come downstairs maybe, and...

599
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:49,275
let me make it up to him
by taking him out tonight?

600
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:52,342
Please.

601
00:55:52,918 --> 00:55:58,833
Uh, Jennifer Larson, she says
she understands if you don't...

602
00:55:58,884 --> 00:56:01,844
Oh, you heard that? Okay, good.

603
00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:04,231
He wants to know where
you're taking him?

604
00:56:05,753 --> 00:56:08,199
Some place he's never been before.

605
00:56:34,764 --> 00:56:36,655
- Hello.
- Hey, Jenny.

606
00:56:36,755 --> 00:56:37,657
C'mon.

607
00:56:45,844 --> 00:56:48,887
All right, you don't actually think
this is my first chop shop do you?

608
00:56:48,927 --> 00:56:52,942
Oh, be quiet,
there's more here that meets the eye.

609
00:56:53,742 --> 00:56:56,936
This used to be one of the most popular
picture houses in the City.

610
00:56:58,938 --> 00:57:01,099
- Movie theater?
- Yes.

611
00:57:02,231 --> 00:57:05,262
In the 1930s,
a woman named Mary Elizabeth Woods,

612
00:57:05,364 --> 00:57:10,699
read about a chemical magnate who had created
the drive-in theater in Camden, New Jersey.

613
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:14,643
And, so naturally she made one
of her own here in San Francisco.

614
00:57:14,943 --> 00:57:17,617
Everyone thought she
was crazy as a loon, which she was.

615
00:57:17,646 --> 00:57:20,168
She would sleep with anyone
who wasn't her husband,

616
00:57:20,268 --> 00:57:24,132
and she used to put on these airs like she
was better than anyone else. In fact...

617
00:57:26,106 --> 00:57:27,338
anyway.

618
00:57:28,233 --> 00:57:31,135
Because of local ordinances she
couldn't have an open-air theater,

619
00:57:31,722 --> 00:57:33,382
so she brought all the car in here.

620
00:57:33,932 --> 00:57:36,481
That's the screen, right there!

621
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:40,403
It was spectacular...
I imagine.

622
00:57:43,913 --> 00:57:46,088
- Are you ready for the best part?
- Sure.

623
00:57:46,568 --> 00:57:47,942
Okay, look up.

624
00:57:58,545 --> 00:58:01,717
She had photo luminescent
filaments installed.

625
00:58:04,284 --> 00:58:07,201
They took the time to
create the constellations.

626
00:58:10,016 --> 00:58:11,239
<i>Isn't it beautiful?</i>

627
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:17,121
Yeah.

628
00:58:27,155 --> 00:58:28,157
What are you doing?

629
00:58:28,811 --> 00:58:29,811
C'mon.

630
00:58:42,677 --> 00:58:43,862
Cheers.

631
00:58:44,652 --> 00:58:47,724
<i>The great paradox of all this is that...</i>

632
00:58:47,831 --> 00:58:51,335
the better our instruments get,
that farther we can see.

633
00:58:52,443 --> 00:58:55,635
But not into the future, into the past.

634
00:58:56,336 --> 00:58:59,041
The events who's light
hasn't even reached us yet.

635
00:58:59,152 --> 00:59:02,641
I don't think I'll ever understand
why so few people care about history?

636
00:59:03,266 --> 00:59:06,072
The future has its charm, too.

637
00:59:07,862 --> 00:59:09,411
We could talk about our ours.

638
00:59:11,824 --> 00:59:14,885
- Ellis...
- Not the distant future.

639
00:59:15,686 --> 00:59:19,655
- Talk about this weekend.
- What did you have in mind?

640
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:25,597
My parents are having a party to celebrate
their 40th wedding anniversary.

641
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:27,324
It's just a couple of hours from here.

642
00:59:30,003 --> 00:59:31,003
Come with me.

643
00:59:45,905 --> 00:59:47,836
Okay.

644
00:59:49,518 --> 00:59:50,920
Can I drive?

645
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:04,434
<i>Oh, my God, you know you rarely
see a</i> Saab in the Daytona 500.

646
01:00:04,833 --> 01:00:06,264
There's a reason for that.

647
01:00:06,465 --> 01:00:11,068
Then... ya know, you might wanna consider an
occasional tap on that square pedal by your foot.

648
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:12,702
I don't know what
you're talking about.

649
01:00:15,023 --> 01:00:21,311
Oh, my God! Oh, sorry!
What's wrong with you?

650
01:00:28,737 --> 01:00:30,889
Do me a favor, stop and pick her up.

651
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:35,813
- Ooh, I'd rather not get stabbed.
- That's my sister.

652
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,769
Sorry.

653
01:00:46,195 --> 01:00:48,297
- What's up pussycat?
- Need a ride?

654
01:00:48,768 --> 01:00:49,768
What's it look like?

655
01:00:53,532 --> 01:00:55,835
- How are you?
- Good, hi!

656
01:00:56,985 --> 01:01:00,039
Get out! Still driving the Saab, huh?

657
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:01,942
- Yeah, it's good to see you, too.
- Hey!

658
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:05,903
Kikki, this is Jenny.
Jenny, this is my sister.

659
01:01:06,005 --> 01:01:07,777
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

660
01:01:08,177 --> 01:01:10,059
You should have told me
you were taking the bus.

661
01:01:10,409 --> 01:01:11,690
We'd of picked you up at the station.

662
01:01:11,891 --> 01:01:13,842
I stopped using
telephones 2 months ago.

663
01:01:15,184 --> 01:01:16,916
Any particular reason?

664
01:01:17,456 --> 01:01:21,780
To protest the involvement of telecomm firms
in the development of hi-tech weapon systems.

665
01:01:23,623 --> 01:01:25,293
Kikki graduated from Berkeley.

666
01:01:26,936 --> 01:01:29,697
So this is the new one, huh?

667
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,603
Have you done him yet?

668
01:01:34,373 --> 01:01:36,525
Yes, 10 minutes ago,
right where you're sitting.

669
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:43,782
<i>So what's the story with</i> this girl,
she... she works there?

670
01:01:43,983 --> 01:01:45,735
I told everything Ellis told me.

671
01:01:49,248 --> 01:01:50,248
Thank you.

672
01:01:50,889 --> 01:01:52,141
Beautiful girl,

673
01:01:54,364 --> 01:01:56,014
works in a public library.

674
01:01:56,835 --> 01:01:59,329
Maybe she likes books... and silence.

675
01:01:59,639 --> 01:02:01,139
Or maybe she Google'd him,

676
01:02:01,239 --> 01:02:04,393
and found out about his generous
contributions and then...

677
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:07,735
worked her way in there so
she could get her hooks into him.

678
01:02:07,836 --> 01:02:09,188
Yeah, I'll bet that's it.

679
01:02:09,568 --> 01:02:12,391
- Shouldn't they be here by now?
- You clear the table.

680
01:02:23,503 --> 01:02:24,543
<i>They're here!</i>

681
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:26,025
Yeah, yeah.

682
01:02:26,746 --> 01:02:27,746
How do I look?

683
01:02:29,918 --> 01:02:30,920
Very pretty.

684
01:02:36,865 --> 01:02:38,336
Oh! There you are!

685
01:02:38,438 --> 01:02:39,579
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

686
01:02:40,259 --> 01:02:44,784
- Aaw, Honey! You look great.
- Look who we picked up on the way.

687
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:46,255
Hi, Baby.

688
01:02:47,547 --> 01:02:49,987
- So, this is Jenny.
- Hello.

689
01:02:50,088 --> 01:02:52,070
- So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

690
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:54,032
You must be exhausted after your trip.

691
01:02:54,132 --> 01:02:57,347
Oh, no, it was nothing.
We made it in like 18 minutes.

692
01:02:57,547 --> 01:03:01,769
No I'm not amused.
He knows I hate it when he speeds.

693
01:03:01,871 --> 01:03:05,333
It wasn't me, it was Jenny, I swear,
she thinks she has nine lives.

694
01:03:05,434 --> 01:03:06,092
Let me take your coat.

695
01:03:06,155 --> 01:03:07,567
- Oh, okay.
- Where ya been?

696
01:03:07,766 --> 01:03:10,420
- What, you forget where we live?
- No.

697
01:03:11,911 --> 01:03:13,753
Uh, this is my dad, William.

698
01:03:13,952 --> 01:03:16,965
- Dad, this is...
- Adaline.

699
01:03:23,972 --> 01:03:26,054
Jenny, actually.

700
01:03:29,909 --> 01:03:31,740
Dad, you okay?

701
01:03:34,463 --> 01:03:36,128
I'm sorry, it's just...

702
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:40,527
you look exactly like this
old friend of mine that I...

703
01:03:40,849 --> 01:03:42,050
Adaline Bowman.

704
01:03:44,873 --> 01:03:45,875
That's my mother.

705
01:03:48,347 --> 01:03:49,807
You joking? Really?

706
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:51,481
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh!

707
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:58,867
- Did you know her?
- Yeah! Yeah!

708
01:04:00,449 --> 01:04:04,442
We were very close, I...
I knew her in London.

709
01:04:04,967 --> 01:04:07,996
Yeah, yes she lived there in the 60s.

710
01:04:08,097 --> 01:04:09,628
Right before she, ah...

711
01:04:09,728 --> 01:04:12,472
moved to Paris and met my father.

712
01:04:12,771 --> 01:04:14,793
Incredible, what are the odds?

713
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:16,795
Wow, wow.

714
01:04:16,996 --> 01:04:21,380
The resemblance is absolutely amazing.
You must hear it all the time.

715
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:23,853
For as long as I can remember.

716
01:04:24,052 --> 01:04:25,925
Wow! We were very close.

717
01:04:26,125 --> 01:04:30,081
You've just said that already.
I don't believe you never mentioned her.

718
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:31,949
Oh, yeah, I must've...

719
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:35,612
No, no... no, I remember
your close, close friends.

720
01:04:35,661 --> 01:04:37,481
How she doin'?

721
01:04:39,539 --> 01:04:43,373
She passed away... 6 years ago.

722
01:04:43,943 --> 01:04:44,943
No, really?

723
01:04:46,806 --> 01:04:49,338
Oh, wow, I'm so sorry.

724
01:04:55,003 --> 01:04:56,695
An extraordinary woman.

725
01:04:56,945 --> 01:04:59,728
Yeah, well, it runs in the family.

726
01:05:05,864 --> 01:05:07,556
- Come on, want something to eat?
- Yeah.

727
01:05:07,657 --> 01:05:09,579
Yeah, I made cheesecake.

728
01:05:11,721 --> 01:05:13,643
We're kinda tired actually.

729
01:05:14,403 --> 01:05:16,365
I think we'll head up,
if that's okay with you?

730
01:05:16,755 --> 01:05:18,016
- Me too.
- Really?

731
01:05:18,217 --> 01:05:19,898
All right, I have you
in the back bedrooms.

732
01:05:19,969 --> 01:05:21,460
<i>Ha! You're in the back.</i>

733
01:05:22,992 --> 01:05:23,992
- Hey.
- Hey.

734
01:05:24,032 --> 01:05:25,875
It's so nice to meet you.

735
01:05:26,626 --> 01:05:31,233
- Dad...
- Oh, hey.. hey, Baby.

736
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,402
Miss.

737
01:06:33,842 --> 01:06:34,844
Miss.

738
01:06:36,615 --> 01:06:38,286
You know, you keep doing that,
you gonna flood your engine.

739
01:06:38,387 --> 01:06:40,570
Thank you, thank you for the useful tip.

740
01:06:41,269 --> 01:06:43,112
Well, you gonna get
one hell of a tan at least.

741
01:06:46,715 --> 01:06:50,610
<i>I'm sorry, I've done</i> everything
I could to get this thing started.

742
01:06:50,619 --> 01:06:52,422
It won't work.

743
01:06:54,103 --> 01:06:55,969
All right, all it needs is a push-start.

744
01:06:56,485 --> 01:06:58,858
Just loose the brake,
I'll give you a push,

745
01:06:59,268 --> 01:07:01,119
Pop your clutch and you'll take off.

746
01:07:02,922 --> 01:07:03,922
Okay.

747
01:07:06,125 --> 01:07:07,126
Thank you.

748
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:10,938
- Ready?
- Ready, you ready?

749
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:11,940
- Okay.
- Okay.

750
01:07:14,483 --> 01:07:15,644
Okay! Now pop your clutch.

751
01:07:18,777 --> 01:07:19,818
Thank you!

752
01:07:23,231 --> 01:07:24,233
You're welcome.

753
01:07:42,472 --> 01:07:44,744
<i>They would spend the next
five weeks together.</i>

754
01:07:45,233 --> 01:07:49,277
<i>And Adaline did something that she
promised herself she would never do.</i>

755
01:07:49,478 --> 01:07:52,552
You know, you...
you still haven't told me your name.

756
01:07:54,704 --> 01:07:55,914
Adaline Bowman.

757
01:07:57,275 --> 01:07:59,958
- But my friends tell me Della.
- That's beautiful.

758
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:02,170
Thank you.

759
01:08:03,222 --> 01:08:08,297
<i>Three weeks later, his semester completed,
William flew home to the United States.</i>

760
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:12,862
Adaline, came with him.

761
01:08:56,916 --> 01:08:57,917
Hey.

762
01:08:59,408 --> 01:09:00,634
How'd you sleep?

763
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:02,822
- Fine.
- Good.

764
01:09:10,259 --> 01:09:14,198
Sorry about last night, I didn't
mean to embarrass you, it's just...

765
01:09:16,576 --> 01:09:18,386
I must be losin' it.

766
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:20,238
It's okay.

767
01:09:25,824 --> 01:09:27,256
- Hey!
- When did you come up?

768
01:09:28,216 --> 01:09:31,451
- Not too late, I read for a while.
- Hmm...

769
01:09:33,032 --> 01:09:34,033
- Hi, Baby.
- Mwah!

770
01:09:35,444 --> 01:09:37,806
- Where's Jenny?
- She'll be down in a sec.

771
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:40,038
<i>She was up all night,
tossing and turning.</i>

772
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:43,483
You know, you've never
told us how you guys met.

773
01:09:44,243 --> 01:09:47,166
We met in an elevator on New Year's Eve.

774
01:09:48,266 --> 01:09:50,649
- You want some coffee?
- No, thank you.

775
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:53,542
<i>But, I'd seen her once before that.</i>

776
01:09:54,059 --> 01:09:55,060
Hey.

777
01:09:55,083 --> 01:09:58,728
<i>It was at the library, she was reading
a book on Braille and I just</i>

778
01:09:58,828 --> 01:10:00,288
I knew she was an original.

779
01:10:00,689 --> 01:10:02,551
Here you go, Baby.
So was her mom.

780
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:05,144
How did you meet her mother?

781
01:10:06,405 --> 01:10:11,490
<i>It was outside London.</i>
Her car broke down, I helped her fix it.

782
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:16,024
So, she was English? Oh, no, no she
was just there studying French.

783
01:10:16,576 --> 01:10:19,469
- Spoke like what, four languages?
- I think so.

784
01:10:19,479 --> 01:10:20,479
- Wow.
- Yeah.

785
01:10:20,859 --> 01:10:23,231
- Jenny's brilliant with languages, too.
- Really?

786
01:10:23,882 --> 01:10:26,545
So, how old were you when you met her?

787
01:10:26,645 --> 01:10:28,398
Oh, I was about, uh...

788
01:10:28,497 --> 01:10:31,376
Let's see, that was the second year
of med school, so I was like...

789
01:10:31,541 --> 01:10:33,114
Twenty-six.

790
01:10:34,833 --> 01:10:38,358
I was thinkin' about
quitting medicine... bored.

791
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:40,269
<i>But I was...</i>

792
01:10:41,661 --> 01:10:44,292
I was afraid I was too old to start over.

793
01:10:45,944 --> 01:10:46,945
I told...

794
01:10:48,507 --> 01:10:51,530
I told Adaline about it
and she laughed in my face.

795
01:10:51,921 --> 01:10:57,766
<i>"She said, " Go for it, don't
be silly, life's too short.</i>

796
01:10:57,907 --> 01:11:02,567
<i>Wasn't for her I'd probably
wouldn't've found astronomy, physics.</i>

797
01:11:02,862 --> 01:11:06,213
<i>She was only couple of years
older than I was but she was so wise.</i>

798
01:11:06,315 --> 01:11:07,817
She was so...

799
01:11:08,096 --> 01:11:09,297
I don't know... sophisticated.

800
01:11:17,957 --> 01:11:18,957
She, uh...

801
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,475
- What? Honey?
- That's enough, William.

802
01:11:36,386 --> 01:11:38,847
What? What's... what's cooking?

803
01:11:38,988 --> 01:11:40,699
What, you think this is funny?

804
01:11:41,331 --> 01:11:43,422
What do you mean? I'm do...
What did I do?

805
01:11:43,523 --> 01:11:48,237
You were very close, you were very close,
you said that to me twice now.

806
01:11:49,057 --> 01:11:51,789
And you should see your face
when you talk about her.

807
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:54,684
Are you going to wax nostalgic
this whole god damn weekend?

808
01:11:54,694 --> 01:11:56,876
Look, it's just that...

809
01:11:56,956 --> 01:11:59,034
she looks so much like her mother that...

810
01:11:59,085 --> 01:12:02,381
that I'm remembering things that
I didn't even know I remembered.

811
01:12:02,481 --> 01:12:04,912
Well, I'd hate feeling like second choice.

812
01:12:05,014 --> 01:12:06,716
- What do you mean?
- Especially this weekend.

813
01:12:06,746 --> 01:12:08,235
- Second choice?
- Yes.

814
01:12:08,337 --> 01:12:10,699
Forty years, Baby, come on...

815
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:12,811
Second choice? Uh-uh.

816
01:12:13,533 --> 01:12:16,125
Honey, you're blowing this
all out of proportion.

817
01:12:16,234 --> 01:12:17,235
Am I?

818
01:12:17,837 --> 01:12:19,198
Are you jealous?

819
01:12:21,831 --> 01:12:24,338
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

820
01:12:24,694 --> 01:12:28,417
Look, look, it was fleeting,

821
01:12:29,418 --> 01:12:31,319
inconsequential.

822
01:12:33,493 --> 01:12:35,841
Sounded like you were more than that.

823
01:12:38,256 --> 01:12:39,368
I love you.

824
01:12:40,259 --> 01:12:42,801
- I love you, too.
- Come on.

825
01:13:02,261 --> 01:13:03,261
I'm coming!

826
01:13:05,545 --> 01:13:07,987
<i>It's not the most romantic weekend.</i>

827
01:13:08,287 --> 01:13:09,958
Thanks for being such a good sport.

828
01:13:10,369 --> 01:13:12,841
- Of course!
- I promise I'll make it up to ya.

829
01:13:26,706 --> 01:13:29,228
Sorry about my dad,
it's really embarrassing.

830
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:31,761
He's lovely.

831
01:13:34,413 --> 01:13:36,905
Yeah, your mom must've
really been something.

832
01:13:39,018 --> 01:13:40,298
Yeah, she was.

833
01:13:47,667 --> 01:13:48,667
Kikki!

834
01:13:50,619 --> 01:13:55,123
So, guys, Dad is running
a 47 game winning streak.

835
01:13:55,824 --> 01:13:59,819
All the money I spent on your education,
I was hoping for stronger competition.

836
01:13:59,918 --> 01:14:02,041
- Have you played this before?
- No never.

837
01:14:02,051 --> 01:14:04,394
- Kikki, come on!
- Do I have to?

838
01:14:04,503 --> 01:14:05,895
- Yeah!
- Yes!

839
01:14:06,666 --> 01:14:10,338
The idea is to get enough
of these little wedges.

840
01:14:10,439 --> 01:14:12,161
- Pie.
- They're cheese.

841
01:14:12,641 --> 01:14:17,356
They're wedges, you get enough of 'em to
fill-up your circle then you win, okay?

842
01:14:17,457 --> 01:14:19,979
<i>Most of the questions are
about this stupid stuff.</i>

843
01:14:20,359 --> 01:14:21,850
Hence the word "Trivial".

844
01:14:21,951 --> 01:14:23,712
Yeah, like here's an
example for you, umm...

845
01:14:24,122 --> 01:14:29,768
"On June 22, 1938, this American boxer
retained his heavyweight championship"

846
01:14:29,868 --> 01:14:32,681
"when he beat Max Schmeling
in the first round."

847
01:14:33,252 --> 01:14:36,456
- Well, that is a tough one.
- I know, what do you think?

848
01:14:40,168 --> 01:14:41,170
Sony Liston?

849
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,792
- Joe Louis.
- Good guess though, really.

850
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:47,725
Women and boxing, it's cute.

851
01:14:47,827 --> 01:14:49,198
Excuse me, do you know what then?

852
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,442
You know what, finally
ladies we're on the team.

853
01:14:52,452 --> 01:14:54,617
- Here, roll the die.
- Here we go. - All right.

854
01:14:54,667 --> 01:14:55,654
Here we go.

855
01:14:56,255 --> 01:14:57,256
Women are pink.

856
01:14:58,226 --> 01:14:59,228
Women are pink?

857
01:15:03,342 --> 01:15:07,024
"Who was the first United States
President to be born in a hospital."

858
01:15:07,126 --> 01:15:08,027
Jimmy Carter.

859
01:15:12,521 --> 01:15:13,523
Jimmy Carter.

860
01:15:15,390 --> 01:15:16,391
<i>That's fast.</i>

861
01:15:16,416 --> 01:15:19,198
- Beginners luck.
- I don't think so, try again.

862
01:15:22,801 --> 01:15:25,875
"At what event did the
'Hula Hoop' make its debut?"

863
01:15:27,487 --> 01:15:32,822
In 1956, at the World's Fair
in Schenectady, New York.

864
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:39,067
1956 World's Fair,
Schenectady, New York.

865
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:40,859
Oh, my God.

866
01:15:42,201 --> 01:15:43,563
- Nice one!
- Wow.

867
01:15:44,753 --> 01:15:46,970
- Cheese.
- Pie.

868
01:15:47,612 --> 01:15:49,167
Wedge.

869
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:54,212
All right, come on, do this.

870
01:15:54,314 --> 01:15:55,297
Oh, a lotta pressure.

871
01:15:55,395 --> 01:15:58,432
Smell somethin',
like your winning streak going up in smoke?

872
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:02,002
We've got this family joke,
what would happen first,

873
01:16:02,086 --> 01:16:06,945
<i>Dad loses in Trivial Pursuit,</i>
or Della finally appears?

874
01:16:08,938 --> 01:16:09,939
Della?

875
01:16:10,109 --> 01:16:13,353
<i>Yeah, you remember the comet I told
you about,</i> the one that my dad discovered?

876
01:16:13,552 --> 01:16:16,435
He named it Della C 1981,

877
01:16:17,275 --> 01:16:19,922
after my great Aunt Adele.

878
01:16:20,329 --> 01:16:21,591
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah?

879
01:16:21,791 --> 01:16:24,457
- Dad, come on.
- Here we go.

880
01:16:24,506 --> 01:16:25,435
Jenny.

881
01:16:27,015 --> 01:16:28,296
For the win...

882
01:16:30,038 --> 01:16:35,704
"Of what country was Albert Einstein
offered the presidency in 1952?"

883
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:42,601
Israel.

884
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:46,435
Israel.

885
01:16:52,881 --> 01:16:55,283
It's okay, I still love you.

886
01:16:55,385 --> 01:16:58,698
How does it feel dad?
<i>Are you sad?</i>

887
01:16:59,479 --> 01:17:00,479
I'm all right.

888
01:17:02,862 --> 01:17:07,650
Let's look at page 2, okay?
That's section 3, paragraph H.

889
01:17:08,528 --> 01:17:11,009
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, I'm going for a walk.

890
01:17:11,109 --> 01:17:12,412
Okay.

891
01:17:19,268 --> 01:17:21,289
Yes, let's look at 10... 10.

892
01:17:41,751 --> 01:17:44,252
How many stars do you think
there are in our galaxy?

893
01:17:47,466 --> 01:17:49,359
I don't know, five hundred million.

894
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:53,631
Coupla hundred billion.

895
01:17:59,399 --> 01:18:05,994
Plato believed that every soul has a companion
star it that returns to after death...

896
01:18:06,596 --> 01:18:08,529
if you lived a moral life.

897
01:18:09,427 --> 01:18:10,429
You believe that?

898
01:18:11,539 --> 01:18:13,695
No, no, I'm a...

899
01:18:14,088 --> 01:18:19,372
I'm a scientist,
Plato was a philosopher... poet.

900
01:18:25,872 --> 01:18:27,851
Why did you name your
Comet after my mother?

901
01:18:32,863 --> 01:18:36,773
If my calculations were correct,
that turned out to be wrong,

902
01:18:36,974 --> 01:18:43,094
it would've been the closest approach
to Earth of any comet in 200 years.

903
01:18:44,774 --> 01:18:51,443
In other words,
like your mother, a near miss.

904
01:18:53,636 --> 01:18:55,127
What does that mean?

905
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:02,090
I was gonna propose her.

906
01:19:06,122 --> 01:19:10,958
I had... I had an engagement
ring in my pocket.

907
01:19:13,975 --> 01:19:15,474
She stood me up.

908
01:19:20,997 --> 01:19:22,113
Near miss.

909
01:19:23,502 --> 01:19:24,502
Good night.

910
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:32,974
William.

911
01:19:37,368 --> 01:19:38,798
She loved you, too.

912
01:20:00,836 --> 01:20:01,837
Wow.

913
01:20:02,893 --> 01:20:07,530
We just met, right? I know that.

914
01:20:09,122 --> 01:20:11,712
Yeah, I should probably shut up right now.

915
01:20:16,305 --> 01:20:17,444
I'll just shut up.

916
01:20:18,335 --> 01:20:19,896
Come on, what?

917
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:26,140
What is it?

918
01:20:26,242 --> 01:20:29,864
I... I... I... I just gotta
tell you the truth, I...

919
01:20:30,653 --> 01:20:32,823
I can't imagine my life without you.

920
01:20:34,032 --> 01:20:37,242
I know it's probably the last
thing wanna hear right now, but,

921
01:20:39,778 --> 01:20:41,822
I'm falling in love with you, Jenny.

922
01:20:42,751 --> 01:20:43,927
I can't help it.

923
01:20:49,283 --> 01:20:51,073
I don't know what to say.

924
01:20:55,274 --> 01:20:56,756
I deal with all of this with respect.

925
01:20:57,046 --> 01:21:00,913
Please, do not say anything, all right?
I just wanted you to know how I feel.

926
01:21:18,618 --> 01:21:21,610
- Oh, hello.
- Jenny.

927
01:21:22,805 --> 01:21:24,302
Do you know where everyone went?

928
01:21:24,804 --> 01:21:29,273
Yeah, Kathy and Kikki went to the
market and Ellis went for a... for a run.

929
01:21:29,375 --> 01:21:33,122
- Well, okay.
- You have a bug in your hair.

930
01:21:33,172 --> 01:21:34,326
- It's all right, it's a...
- What it is?

931
01:21:34,426 --> 01:21:35,966
It's a ladybug.

932
01:21:37,369 --> 01:21:38,865
They say they're good luck.

933
01:21:40,899 --> 01:21:41,899
Did you get it?

934
01:21:43,414 --> 01:21:45,666
- Got it.
- Thank you.

935
01:21:50,471 --> 01:21:52,704
Please tell Ellis that I went for a walk.

936
01:22:40,886 --> 01:22:42,969
- Della, you okay?
- Oh, my God!

937
01:22:59,145 --> 01:23:01,283
- This is gonna sting.
- Okay, okay.

938
01:23:12,509 --> 01:23:14,052
Don't worry, we'll fix you up.

939
01:23:19,475 --> 01:23:22,265
Oh! Oh!

940
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:48,811
Excuse me... hi.

941
01:23:49,909 --> 01:23:52,948
- Do you mind taking our photo?
- Sure.

942
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:54,944
Okay, I don't, I don't.

943
01:23:54,994 --> 01:23:56,716
- It's going to be great.
- I don't want it.

944
01:23:56,795 --> 01:24:00,091
- Wadya mean you don't want it?
- No, we're wasting film.

945
01:24:01,148 --> 01:24:02,384
I'm just really shy.

946
01:24:02,484 --> 01:24:05,150
Three, two, one...

947
01:24:55,828 --> 01:24:56,828
I know.

948
01:24:59,399 --> 01:25:01,595
I know who you are, Adaline.

949
01:25:04,671 --> 01:25:05,671
What?

950
01:25:08,096 --> 01:25:13,600
The scar... the same scar,
I stitched it myself.

951
01:25:15,244 --> 01:25:16,246
Please.

952
01:25:19,318 --> 01:25:20,845
The truth.

953
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:32,039
William.

954
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:41,132
I thought I was losing my mind.

955
01:25:44,109 --> 01:25:47,832
How? How is this possible?

956
01:25:52,961 --> 01:25:54,400
I don't... I don't know.

957
01:25:56,927 --> 01:25:59,273
I...I, I was normal.

958
01:26:02,122 --> 01:26:04,751
And then one day...
I just stopped.

959
01:26:07,105 --> 01:26:11,886
I wanted to tell you so badly,
but I couldn't.

960
01:26:13,259 --> 01:26:14,988
You know what they'd do to me, I...

961
01:26:15,895 --> 01:26:18,313
- I would have been a...
- Curiosity.

962
01:26:20,859 --> 01:26:22,061
- A specimen.
- Yes.

963
01:26:27,475 --> 01:26:33,748
That's why you left?
That's why you... disappeared?

964
01:26:40,582 --> 01:26:42,404
You can't imagine how much it hurt.

965
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:48,710
I think, I... I think I can.

966
01:26:53,869 --> 01:26:58,100
- You've never told anyone?
- No.

967
01:26:59,237 --> 01:27:02,221
If I had, it would have been Ellis.

968
01:27:07,804 --> 01:27:10,114
<i>Don't, don't run away.</i>

969
01:27:11,268 --> 01:27:14,582
Don't disappear again, please... for Ellis.

970
01:27:15,274 --> 01:27:17,524
- Adaline...
- Please.

971
01:27:20,172 --> 01:27:24,377
All these years,
you've lived but you've never had a life.

972
01:27:25,876 --> 01:27:31,016
Please, for yourself,
for Ellis, stay, Adaline.

973
01:27:32,261 --> 01:27:33,353
I don't know how.

974
01:27:33,970 --> 01:27:36,465
Don't run away, Adaline. Adaline!

975
01:27:37,188 --> 01:27:38,189
Adaline!

976
01:28:55,637 --> 01:28:58,412
Adaline don't, don't.
Adaline, please.

977
01:28:59,534 --> 01:29:00,685
Please don't do this.

978
01:29:00,827 --> 01:29:04,431
Adaline, don't.
Think about Ellis, please!

979
01:29:05,177 --> 01:29:07,399
Adaline, please! Adaline!

980
01:29:33,238 --> 01:29:36,838
<b><u>Ellis, I'm so sorry. I can't do this.
I can't explain. Jenny.

981
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:47,757
Dad! Dad!

982
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:50,130
Dad, where're your keys?

983
01:29:55,042 --> 01:29:55,953
She's gone.

984
01:30:02,034 --> 01:30:04,810
She's not coming back, Son.

985
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:08,510
What just happened?
What, what... what is this?

986
01:30:09,627 --> 01:30:12,546
- Dad, what the hell did you say to her?
- Nothing.

987
01:30:15,212 --> 01:30:16,636
She can't explain.

988
01:30:17,389 --> 01:30:19,617
Please tell me what she said.

989
01:30:22,421 --> 01:30:25,827
- She's not capable.
- Of what?

990
01:30:31,132 --> 01:30:33,076
Of change.

991
01:30:59,884 --> 01:31:00,939
Do you love her?

992
01:31:02,351 --> 01:31:03,653
Son?

993
01:31:04,494 --> 01:31:06,725
Listen to me. Do you love her?

994
01:31:07,604 --> 01:31:08,604
Yes.

995
01:31:11,795 --> 01:31:12,796
How do you know?

996
01:31:13,456 --> 01:31:16,478
- Dad, I don't...
- It's a simple question.

997
01:31:17,707 --> 01:31:18,708
How do you know?

998
01:31:21,721 --> 01:31:23,625
Because nothing makes
sense without her.

999
01:32:29,442 --> 01:32:31,202
- <i> Hello.</i>
- Oh.

1000
01:32:31,465 --> 01:32:33,386
Darling, I'm so sorry,
I didn't mean to wake you.

1001
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:36,442
- <i> Everything okay?</i>
- No, no... I just wanted to tell you...

1002
01:32:36,492 --> 01:32:37,430
<i>What is it?</i>

1003
01:32:38,807 --> 01:32:40,680
You're right, no more running.

1004
01:32:40,792 --> 01:32:44,176
- <i>Mom?</i>
- I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

1005
01:32:44,328 --> 01:32:46,850
- <i>I am so happy to hear that.</i>
- I love you.

1006
01:32:46,997 --> 01:32:48,703
- <i>I love you too.</i>
- Bye.

1007
01:32:48,810 --> 01:32:49,811
<i>Bye, Mama.</i>

1008
01:34:03,514 --> 01:34:08,029
<i>The moon is responsible for much of what
takes place on the surface of the Earth.</i>

1009
01:34:08,757 --> 01:34:12,939
<i>A stray meteor hit
the Moon in 1178.</i>

1010
01:34:13,734 --> 01:34:16,125
<i>The resulting concussion
would cause extreme tides</i>

1011
01:34:16,194 --> 01:34:19,636
<i>on every lunar phase
in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina.</i>

1012
01:34:20,358 --> 01:34:23,880
<i>A 23% rise in the mean
tide on this night</i>

1013
01:34:24,384 --> 01:34:28,533
<i>produced a storm 2000 miles
off the Pacific coast,</i>

1014
01:34:29,612 --> 01:34:33,823
<i>causing an increase in amount of
molecular ionization in the atmosphere.</i>

1015
01:34:35,306 --> 01:34:37,796
<i>And for the first time in 78 years,</i>

1016
01:34:38,993 --> 01:34:42,606
<i>snow fell in this
part of Sonoma County.</i>

1017
01:34:46,735 --> 01:34:49,247
<i>In the first stages of hypothermia,</i>

1018
01:34:49,363 --> 01:34:53,208
<i>the body will try to generate
heat through shivering.</i>

1019
01:34:54,617 --> 01:34:59,109
<i>When this fails, it would decrease
the flow of blood to the extremities.</i>

1020
01:35:00,494 --> 01:35:03,403
<i>Metabolism slows to a crawl.</i>

1021
01:35:04,918 --> 01:35:07,618
<i>You're dying, but you don't know it.</i>

1022
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:10,976
<i>In the final stages...</i>

1023
01:35:11,627 --> 01:35:14,582
<i>the victim only breathes
once or twice a minute.</i>

1024
01:35:15,993 --> 01:35:19,824
<i>A state of suspended animation.</i>

1025
01:35:45,592 --> 01:35:46,594
Jenny!

1026
01:35:47,497 --> 01:35:54,306
<i>At 10:07 p.m., Adaline Bowman's core
temperature had dropped to 87 degrees.</i>

1027
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:58,417
<i>Her heart stopped beating.</i>

1028
01:36:20,890 --> 01:36:24,868
<i>At last, at the age of
one hundred and seven,</i>

1029
01:36:25,704 --> 01:36:30,234
<i>Adaline Bowman was, by
any definition, dead.</i>

1030
01:36:39,662 --> 01:36:43,301
<i>At precisely 10:09
p.m., paramedics placed</i>

1031
01:36:43,350 --> 01:36:46,649
<i>two defibrillator paddles
on Adaline Bowman's chest.</i>

1032
01:36:48,390 --> 01:36:54,365
<i>They counted the prescribed 5 seconds before
administering 750 volts of electricity.</i>

1033
01:38:10,670 --> 01:38:11,671
How is she?

1034
01:38:11,694 --> 01:38:15,780
We've just run a series of tests
and don't see any long term damage.

1035
01:38:16,288 --> 01:38:17,930
It's quite remarkable, in fact.

1036
01:38:18,506 --> 01:38:20,171
Is she awake? Can I go see her?

1037
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:23,591
She's exhausted but you might
be able to get in a few words.

1038
01:38:23,605 --> 01:38:25,828
Okay, thank you.

1039
01:38:43,019 --> 01:38:44,020
Hi.

1040
01:38:48,689 --> 01:38:49,932
Jenny.

1041
01:38:51,414 --> 01:38:53,717
- Hi.
- Hey!

1042
01:39:09,068 --> 01:39:10,497
I know why you ran away.

1043
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:14,362
You do?

1044
01:39:15,541 --> 01:39:18,132
It's because of what I said
to you last night, isn't it?

1045
01:39:19,088 --> 01:39:21,117
I told you I loved you.

1046
01:39:22,359 --> 01:39:23,837
- And you got scared, I shouldn't...
- Come here, I love you.

1047
01:39:23,887 --> 01:39:26,164
Come here, come here, I love you.

1048
01:39:35,356 --> 01:39:37,146
I love you, too.

1049
01:39:57,208 --> 01:39:59,046
There's something else.

1050
01:40:06,542 --> 01:40:09,270
What? What is it?

1051
01:40:17,752 --> 01:40:22,587
Well, first, my name isn't Jenny.

1052
01:40:34,833 --> 01:40:36,648
My God, what happened?

1053
01:40:36,810 --> 01:40:39,317
Nothing, nothing, an accident,
I'm fine. Okay?

1054
01:40:39,367 --> 01:40:40,393
- But...
- Hey...

1055
01:40:40,747 --> 01:40:42,827
I'm better than fine. Okay?

1056
01:40:44,904 --> 01:40:47,224
- This is Ellis.
- Hello.

1057
01:40:47,332 --> 01:40:48,104
- <i> Hello.</i>

1058
01:40:48,130 --> 01:40:51,215
- He's the man, I've
been telling you about.

1059
01:40:55,086 --> 01:40:56,306
Nice to meet you.

1060
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:00,846
I'm Jenny's grandmother.

1061
01:41:09,935 --> 01:41:12,000
What? What is it?

1062
01:41:14,157 --> 01:41:15,048
He knows.

1063
01:41:20,734 --> 01:41:21,735
He knows.

1064
01:41:43,493 --> 01:41:46,400
Hey, everybody, I don't wanna ruin
the party, but I wanna say something.

1065
01:41:46,497 --> 01:41:48,645
First of all, thanks for being here.

1066
01:41:48,694 --> 01:41:51,989
Kathy and I are really grateful
that you could all be here.

1067
01:41:52,091 --> 01:41:55,880
It means a lot to us that you
would be here and to help

1068
01:41:55,965 --> 01:42:01,109
us celebrate the first...
first 40 years of our marriage.

1069
01:42:02,521 --> 01:42:05,375
When I first met this lovely lady,

1070
01:42:07,105 --> 01:42:08,528
back in the olden days,

1071
01:42:09,148 --> 01:42:15,514
I had a... I had a pretty good idea
what I wanted to do in my job,

1072
01:42:15,614 --> 01:42:19,548
but I didn't really...

1073
01:42:20,659 --> 01:42:21,951
know what I wanted to...

1074
01:42:22,631 --> 01:42:27,827
be as a man when I grew up,
if I ever grew up.

1075
01:42:29,988 --> 01:42:33,573
But the commitment that she made...

1076
01:42:34,273 --> 01:42:38,106
to our marriage and to our family, to me...

1077
01:42:38,868 --> 01:42:42,731
the... quality of her love...

1078
01:42:44,533 --> 01:42:49,715
led me to understand that I could
have no greater ambition...

1079
01:42:49,765 --> 01:42:57,006
in life, than to be the best
possible husband I could be for her.

1080
01:42:57,506 --> 01:42:59,990
And I'm still working on it.

1081
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:06,917
So here's to Kathy, love of my life,

1082
01:43:08,408 --> 01:43:12,832
mate of my soul, mother
of my lovely children.

1083
01:43:14,634 --> 01:43:15,654
To Kathy.

1084
01:43:25,435 --> 01:43:27,996
 One year later.

1085
01:43:30,009 --> 01:43:32,600
<i>We are back, live in Times Square.</i>

1086
01:43:32,702 --> 01:43:35,793
<i>And now, only a few minutes from
the moment we've all been waiting for,</i>

1087
01:43:35,895 --> 01:43:41,684
- <i>... drop ball... to 2016.</i>
- There ya are, Honey, good girl. Yeah.

1088
01:43:45,505 --> 01:43:49,547
Hey, you guys, you better hurry
up, you're gonna be late for the event.

1089
01:43:49,649 --> 01:43:52,820
- Yeah, I've been ready for 10 minutes.
- Oh, so handsome.

1090
01:43:52,921 --> 01:43:55,024
- Thank you.
- I'm ready, too.

1091
01:43:55,875 --> 01:43:58,096
- Wow.
- I just need this zipped.

1092
01:43:58,768 --> 01:44:00,449
Are you sure you don't wanna come with us?

1093
01:44:00,498 --> 01:44:01,740
I'm positive.

1094
01:44:02,992 --> 01:44:06,164
I've got my date, right here.
Come here, Baby.

1095
01:44:08,438 --> 01:44:10,278
- I love you.
- Love you.

1096
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:13,612
I have to grab my clutch.
<i>Oh, and my camera.</i>

1097
01:44:13,712 --> 01:44:16,836
- He's getting so big.
- Yeah.

1098
01:44:50,449 --> 01:44:52,869
Adaline, you okay?

1099
01:44:56,685 --> 01:44:57,686
Yes.

1100
01:45:01,850 --> 01:45:02,851
Perfect.

1101
01:45:05,814 --> 01:45:09,969
<i>The instant Adaline's heart was
struck by the defibrillator paddles,</i>

1102
01:45:10,909 --> 01:45:14,554
<i>the telomere structures in her
genes regained their pliability,</i>

1103
01:45:15,283 --> 01:45:18,618
<i>Causing her to resume
the natural course of aging.</i>

1104
01:45:19,918 --> 01:45:21,810
<i>William was right after all,</i>

1105
01:45:22,492 --> 01:45:25,784
<i>the comet, Della C 1981,
finally did return.</i>

1106
01:45:26,666 --> 01:45:33,432
<i>A half century late. But as bright
and magnificent as he had predicted.</i>
