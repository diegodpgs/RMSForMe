1
00:00:15,524 --> 00:00:16,816
Quiet on the set.

2
00:00:18,194 --> 00:00:21,029
- Okay, everybody, quiet on the set.
- Scene 1, Take 10, marker.

3
00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:30,955
And action.

4
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,417
Joel Levison's office.

5
00:00:34,627 --> 00:00:37,921
No, I'm sorry, he's not in yet.
May I take a message?

6
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:40,798
- Yes, I'll tell him you called.
- Sandy, never say that.

7
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:44,177
He's either in conference, in a meeting.
He's always in.

8
00:00:44,428 --> 00:00:47,430
- Now, who was that?
- A Larry Levy?

9
00:00:48,098 --> 00:00:50,350
I hope there was nothing
in the trades. Was there?

10
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,976
I don't know. The mail's late.

11
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:54,270
- Well, go get them. Now!
- Yes, ma'am.

12
00:00:54,438 --> 00:00:57,649
I want them back here
before he arrives.

13
00:01:12,456 --> 00:01:14,499
Griffin. Griffin, hi.

14
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,627
Adam Simon. I know we're
not supposed to meet till next week...

15
00:01:17,795 --> 00:01:20,338
...but a lot of heat...
- Didn't realize we were meeting.

16
00:01:20,506 --> 00:01:23,007
I wanted to plant the seed
in your head just so that...

17
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:24,926
I'm booked up. I can't hear a pitch.

18
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:28,221
Picture this. It's a planet in
the far, far future with two suns.

19
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:30,640
- Who plays the sons?
- No, suns. Large solar disks.

20
00:01:30,808 --> 00:01:32,684
You gotta run this idea
by Bonnie Sherow.

21
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:36,020
Pictures they make these days
are all MTV. Cut, cut, cut, cut.

22
00:01:36,188 --> 00:01:39,816
The opening shot of Welles' Touch of Evil
was six and a half minutes long.

23
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:41,192
Six and a half minutes, Walter?

24
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:45,488
Well, three or four. Anyway, he set up the
whole picture with that one tracking shot.

25
00:01:45,656 --> 00:01:47,865
My father was the key grip on that shoot.

26
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:52,036
Hey, what about Absolute Beginners?
Man, that was an extraordinary shot.

27
00:01:52,204 --> 00:01:55,540
- What was that? Never heard of it.
- Julien Temple. It's an English film.

28
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:58,001
- Morning.
- We're talking about American movies...

29
00:01:58,168 --> 00:01:59,711
...and Orson Welles was a master.

30
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,839
- Can I have a Pellegrino, please?
- I've got Calistoga.

31
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:05,091
- Hi, Buck, how are you?
- Good, how you doing?

32
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:09,512
- Good. What do you got for me?
- Okay, here it is.

33
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,515
- The Graduate Part Two.
- Oh, good, good.

34
00:02:12,683 --> 00:02:15,518
Now, listen.
The three principals are still with us.

35
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:18,688
Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft,
Katharine Ross.

36
00:02:18,856 --> 00:02:19,856
Mm-hm.

37
00:02:20,024 --> 00:02:23,359
Twenty-five years later,
and so are the characters.

38
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:26,195
Ben, Elaine and Mrs. Robinson.

39
00:02:26,405 --> 00:02:28,197
Ben and Elaine are married still.

40
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:32,827
They live in a big, old, spooky house
up in northern California somewhere...

41
00:02:33,037 --> 00:02:35,538
...and Mrs. Robinson lives with them.

42
00:02:35,706 --> 00:02:40,043
- Mm.
- Her aging mother, who's had a stroke...

43
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,754
- Mrs. Robinson's had a stroke?
- Had a stroke, so she can't talk.

44
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:44,756
- Is this gonna be funny?
- Yeah, it'll be funny.

45
00:02:44,923 --> 00:02:47,258
Dark, and weird, and funny
and with a stroke.

46
00:02:47,426 --> 00:02:48,968
- Okay.
- Maybe it's not a stroke.

47
00:02:49,178 --> 00:02:51,304
- Maybe it's... I don't know what it is.
- Anyway, go on.

48
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:52,805
- It's a malady of some sort.
- Okay.

49
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:56,225
She's up there in the bedroom upstairs,
listening to everything that happens.

50
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:59,103
They've got a daughter
who's just graduated from college.

51
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,564
- Young blood.
- Twenty-two, 23-year-old.

52
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:03,441
- Like a Julia Roberts.
- Julia Roberts. Great.

53
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:04,734
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

54
00:03:04,902 --> 00:03:07,862
- What do I do with these scripts?
- Uh, that goes to Bonnie Sherow.

55
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,199
And, uh, find out from studio security
how Adam Simon got on the lot.

56
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:14,243
- I wanna know.
- Okay. Adam Simon? Okay.

57
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:16,579
- Okay? Julia Roberts comes home.
- Yes, go ahead.

58
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:18,164
Their daughter, the graduate.

59
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,500
- And she brings her...
- The new graduate.

60
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:22,877
Griffin loved it.
He wanted me to run it by you.

61
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:26,172
A band of human survivors,
generations removed from the mother ship.

62
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,008
They have no history.
They've lost their technological knowledge.

63
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:31,678
I can't process this.
Could you write it down?

64
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,513
It's not about words, it's about pictures.

65
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,225
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, man.

66
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:41,104
Jimmy? Jimmy, are you okay?

67
00:03:41,313 --> 00:03:43,648
- What happened?
- Twenty-five words or less?

68
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:44,899
Are you all right?

69
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:46,901
I'd like to say, my name is Jimmy Chase.

70
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:49,112
You all right? Open your eyes. You okay?

71
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:51,823
He just came out of nowhere,
ran right into the car.

72
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,200
- Take it slow.
- It's okay.

73
00:03:55,577 --> 00:03:56,994
Yeah, it's okay.

74
00:03:57,162 --> 00:03:58,913
Hey. Hey, that's Adam Simon.

75
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:01,207
How you doing, kid? I just had a meeting.

76
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,959
- You all right?
- It was good.

77
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:05,044
- Yeah, yeah.
- You sure you're okay?

78
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:12,510
Rebecca De Mornay.
Actually, you're much better looking.

79
00:04:12,678 --> 00:04:14,595
- As a matter of fact, we...
- Um, no.

80
00:04:14,763 --> 00:04:16,472
- I'm not Rebecca De Mornay.
- Dead ringer.

81
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,890
Thank you. Thank you very much.

82
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:20,601
You know where Joel Levison's office is?

83
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:23,354
The Mr. Levison, head of the studio? Yeah.

84
00:04:23,522 --> 00:04:25,773
But it's quite moving.
It'll rip your heart out.

85
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:30,278
This is the area where we make decisions
to give a green light to a picture like that.

86
00:04:30,446 --> 00:04:33,197
Right here. We're gonna go
about 17 stories high, if we can.

87
00:04:33,365 --> 00:04:37,994
We're gonna continue using Sony products.
Domo arigato to the Sony products, really.

88
00:04:38,203 --> 00:04:40,997
In fact, if you need someone
to eat some sashimi with you...

89
00:04:41,206 --> 00:04:42,749
...you give me a ring because...

90
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,834
- Levison's right here.
- Write it down.

91
00:04:45,002 --> 00:04:47,754
I have to know that you're just seeing it.

92
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,422
Good girl.

93
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,340
Traffic from Malibu was impossible.

94
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:53,301
- Morning, Joel.
- Morning, Celia.

95
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:55,261
- Sandy, park the car, please.
- Okay.

96
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:57,221
- Morning, Marty.
- Morning, Joel.

97
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:58,765
Hi.

98
00:04:59,308 --> 00:05:03,728
- What are the Japs doing here?
- So, what's this talk about heads will roll?

99
00:05:03,896 --> 00:05:05,646
The bank's putting the screws to us.

100
00:05:05,814 --> 00:05:08,357
Harvey Goldman's son's coming out,
and I don't like it.

101
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:12,236
Reggie Goldman's a pipsqueak.
You can't be serious.

102
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:15,364
You know, some changes
are going on around here.

103
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:19,368
It's always the way.
Happened at Paramount three years ago.

104
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:21,412
Columbia's going through it now.

105
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,706
I hear we're looking to replace Griffin.

106
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,417
Griffin? I don't believe it. With who?

107
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:28,544
Berg, Kirkpatrick. Maybe Larry Levy.

108
00:05:28,712 --> 00:05:33,424
Yeah. Yeah, well, I wanna know why
the security is so lax, that's why.

109
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:36,511
I'll talk to you about it later.
I'm in the middle of a pitch.

110
00:05:36,678 --> 00:05:38,721
- Listen. Go ahead.
- Yeah, okay, okay.

111
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:41,724
It's a TV star and she goes on safari
in Africa.

112
00:05:41,892 --> 00:05:44,227
You're talking about a TV star
in a motion picture?

113
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:46,938
Not a real TV star.
It would be played by a movie star.

114
00:05:47,105 --> 00:05:50,525
- A movie star playing a television star.
- Goldie, Julia, Michelle...

115
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:52,235
...Bette, Lily.
- Dolly Parton.

116
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:54,278
- Dolly.
- She would be very good.

117
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:56,572
- I like Goldie.
- Goldie Goes to Africa.

118
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,949
Great. We have a relationship.

119
00:05:58,116 --> 00:06:01,285
- That would be great. Goldie Goes to Africa.
- Goldie Goes to Africa.

120
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:03,412
- She becomes worshiped.
- Worshiped?

121
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,581
- Well, she's found by this tribe...
- Yes?

122
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:07,542
Of small people. But then she has to...

123
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:10,378
She's found by this tribe
and they worship her. But then...

124
00:06:10,546 --> 00:06:12,672
I see. It's like a Gods Must Be Crazy...

125
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,924
...except the Coke bottle's
now a television actress.

126
00:06:15,092 --> 00:06:17,552
Yeah, exactly right.
It's Out of Africa meets Pretty Woman.

127
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:19,136
And she has to decide...

128
00:06:19,304 --> 00:06:23,182
...whether to stay with the TV show
or save this entire African tribe.

129
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:24,433
It could be a man.

130
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:26,853
Hey, where's Griffin Mill's office?
- Right here.

131
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,064
- Hey, you're Martin Scorsese.
- No, but I know Harvey Keitel.

132
00:06:30,232 --> 00:06:33,776
Yeah, I know you do.
Hey, I loved Cape Fear. Ha, ha.

133
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:36,279
- My old man worked for Hitchcock too.
- Yeah?

134
00:06:36,488 --> 00:06:40,074
Rope. It was a masterpiece.
The story wasn't any good.

135
00:06:40,242 --> 00:06:43,369
He shot the whole thing without cuts.
I hate all this cut, cut, cut.

136
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:47,039
Oh, yeah, well, what about, uh, Bertolucci,
that great tracking shot...

137
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:51,002
...with Winger in Sheltering Sky?
- I didn't see it.

138
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:54,630
Touch of Evil, that was the one.
Welles...

139
00:06:54,798 --> 00:06:56,716
I been here since 8:00. Honest I have.

140
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:59,802
I stuck my neck out for you to get this job.
Who were you with?

141
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:04,056
- I was there with, um, Alan Rudolph.
- What were you doing with Alan Rudolph?

142
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:07,393
Well, no, he asked me to have coffee.
He was telling me this idea.

143
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,270
- What do I say?
- You're my assistant.

144
00:07:09,438 --> 00:07:13,107
- Don't get involved with writers.
- I wasn't. I was just listening to this idea.

145
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:15,902
- I told him he should give it to you.
- What's your pitch?

146
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,737
Well, does political scare you?

147
00:07:17,946 --> 00:07:20,990
Political doesn't scare me.
Radical political scares me.

148
00:07:21,158 --> 00:07:24,493
- "Political" political scares me.
- This is politely politically radical.

149
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:25,870
- Is it funny?
- It's funny.

150
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,205
- It's a funny political thing.
- It's a thriller too.

151
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,082
- It's a thriller?
- All at once.

152
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:31,584
So, uh, what's the story?

153
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:34,128
Well, I want Bruce Willis.
I think I can talk to him.

154
00:07:34,296 --> 00:07:37,757
Um, it's a story about a senator.
A bad-guy senator at first.

155
00:07:37,966 --> 00:07:40,593
He's traveling around the country
on the country's dime.

156
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:44,847
- Like that Sununu guy used to do.
- Sort of a cynical, political thriller-comedy?

157
00:07:45,057 --> 00:07:47,266
Yeah, but it's got a heart, uh,
in the right spot.

158
00:07:47,476 --> 00:07:49,936
And anyway, he has an accident.

159
00:07:50,145 --> 00:07:53,230
- An accident?
- Yeah, and he becomes clairvoyant.

160
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,066
- Like a psychic. Yeah.
- Oh, I see.

161
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:58,402
So it's kind of a psychic, political
thriller-comedy with a heart.

162
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:02,907
With a heart. And, uh, not unlike Ghost
meets Manchurian Candidate.

163
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,993
- Go on, I'm listening.
- He can start to read people's minds...

164
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:11,040
...and when he gets to the president's mind,
it's completely blank. Completely blank.

165
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,501
- Can I get you anything?
- I'd like a beer, please.

166
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:17,380
- We don't have beer.
- Uh, wine. Red wine, please.

167
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:22,093
Of course, someone gets killed at the end.
They always do in political thrillers.

168
00:08:23,887 --> 00:08:24,887
Griffin Mill's office.

169
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:26,722
I know. Can you put him on?

170
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,433
- It's an intriguing idea, Jim.
- May I ask who's calling?

171
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:31,560
I'd like to speak to Griffin Mill.

172
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:34,105
He's in a meeting.
I'll have him get back to you.

173
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:35,940
- I'll get back to you.
- Thanks.

174
00:08:36,108 --> 00:08:37,900
- Excuse me, sir?
- Bullshit.

175
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:39,568
- He'll get back to me?
- Seen my Binaca?

176
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:41,404
Do you know how many times
I've heard that?

177
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:44,115
- Who is this?
- If he don't get back to me...

178
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:45,908
- I read that script.
- Who was that?

179
00:08:46,076 --> 00:08:47,368
I don't know. He didn't say.

180
00:08:47,536 --> 00:08:50,496
- What do you mean, he didn't say?
- How are you gonna cast it?

181
00:08:50,706 --> 00:08:53,666
The lead character is a 50-year-old
female circus performer.

182
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:56,627
- A fire-eater.
- Let me read the coverage.

183
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,005
Are we still having lunch
with Aaron Camp?

184
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,924
- Yeah, what time?
- I made it for 1:00.

185
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:04,635
- Bad day?
- He's having writer's block.

186
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,974
You have a meeting with Harders
and Frank South this afternoon.

187
00:09:10,142 --> 00:09:12,268
- What time? I'll be here.
- At 3:00. Okay.

188
00:09:12,436 --> 00:09:13,936
Put the meetings on the computer.

189
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:15,938
- All right.
- Thanks.

190
00:09:16,106 --> 00:09:18,482
- You going now? I'll go with you.
- I'm going to see Levison.

191
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,152
I'll meet you there.
Order me a salad and Crystal Geyser.

192
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,611
- Okay. Bye.
- Thanks.

193
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:23,946
Bonnie, can I please...?

194
00:09:24,114 --> 00:09:26,323
We gotta have a time to meet. I'm sorry.

195
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:33,622
- Okay, by 5? Thanks, Sandy.
- Bye.

196
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,166
- Hi, Sandy. Hi, Celia.
- Oh, uh...

197
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,460
You can't go in there. He's in a meeting.

198
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:40,171
I think, you know,
dime a dozen out here, don't you?

199
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,715
- It's all right, Celia.
- You know this one?

200
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,967
Griffin, I don't think
you've met Reg Goldman.

201
00:09:45,177 --> 00:09:48,512
- You know his father, Harvey.
- Yes, of course. Hi. Hi, Reg.

202
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,681
- Nice to meet you.
- From the bank in Boston.

203
00:09:50,849 --> 00:09:53,976
- Reg is out here for a couple of weeks.
- Great.

204
00:09:54,186 --> 00:09:57,813
- Business or pleasure?
- A little of both, I hope.

205
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,858
Reg is thinking of getting
into production, Griffin.

206
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:02,401
Oh, really?

207
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:04,862
Yeah. It beats work, doesn't it, Griffin?

208
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:07,323
Like to play some tennis though.
You play tennis?

209
00:10:07,532 --> 00:10:09,742
Tennis? No, no, no. I, uh, ha, ha...

210
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,495
- I'm too busy for...
- I was just asking Walter here.

211
00:10:12,996 --> 00:10:14,872
Uh, do you know Meg Ryan?

212
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:16,874
Do you know if she's seeing somebody?

213
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:21,670
Um, yeah, Reg, she's married.

214
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:23,214
Shit.

215
00:10:23,673 --> 00:10:26,008
What about Winona Ryder?

216
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:30,888
Um, well, uh, you know,
actually Walter is the guy to talk to.

217
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:32,807
Walter's got everybody's number.

218
00:10:32,974 --> 00:10:36,852
- Was there anything?
- Uh, no. You're real busy.

219
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:40,773
I want that number, goddamn it.
I want that number.

220
00:10:41,024 --> 00:10:44,568
Oh, boy. What about this one here?
Has she done anything?

221
00:10:45,737 --> 00:10:47,404
Celia.

222
00:10:48,532 --> 00:10:51,325
Griffin, don't ask.

223
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:55,871
Don't ask, "You don't know"
or don't ask, "I don't wanna know"?

224
00:10:56,081 --> 00:10:58,582
Just don't ask.

225
00:10:59,543 --> 00:11:04,171
Look, if it's... If it's Reggie Goldman
you're concerned about, forget it.

226
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:06,715
But be nice to him.
He represents a lot of money.

227
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:09,885
It's not Reggie Goldman
I'm worried about.

228
00:11:10,095 --> 00:11:13,389
- It's Larry Levy.
- Larry Levy?

229
00:11:13,598 --> 00:11:15,057
Larry Levy's at Fox, isn't he?

230
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,937
Oh, come on, Celia.

231
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:23,232
Sandy, there's a call for Celia on Line 1.

232
00:11:23,441 --> 00:11:26,735
- Should I be looking for a job?
- Celia, are you there?

233
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,737
Joel Levison's office.

234
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:32,783
Oh, Brad. Yeah. What?

235
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:35,578
No, we couldn't sign Anjelica Huston
for that project.

236
00:11:35,745 --> 00:11:37,454
She's booked for the next two years.

237
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:41,750
Yeah, like a ghost story,
but that's not like Ghost.

238
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,419
- Well, now...
- Um, in which, maybe...

239
00:11:43,587 --> 00:11:44,879
We should be somewhere...

240
00:11:45,046 --> 00:11:49,091
...but I understand what you're saying.
- Unnatural Lives. It's a supernatural thing.

241
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,844
Joel. Griffin Mill.

242
00:11:52,095 --> 00:11:54,180
- Friend of Jennifer's.
- No, no.

243
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:55,848
- You're Griffin Mill?
- Yes.

244
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:57,308
- Really?
- Good to see you.

245
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,018
- I'm a big fan.
- I have that tie.

246
00:11:59,227 --> 00:12:01,395
- You do?
- Mr. Mill, how are you today?

247
00:12:01,563 --> 00:12:04,899
- Okay. How are you doing, Natalie?
- Fine. Have a seat.

248
00:12:05,066 --> 00:12:07,109
Where's Bonnie?

249
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:10,487
- Did you order for me?
- Oh, my gosh. I'm shocked.

250
00:12:10,655 --> 00:12:11,822
- Hi, Griffin.
- Hi.

251
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,199
- Hi, buddy.
- Hi. How are you?

252
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:14,450
Lunching with the enemy.

253
00:12:15,827 --> 00:12:17,620
Oh, come on.

254
00:12:17,787 --> 00:12:20,706
So, uh,
what's this we hear about Larry Levy?

255
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:24,752
Larry Levy?
If he had half a brain, he'd be dangerous.

256
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:28,964
Aaron says he's coming to the studio.

257
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:32,468
Aaron says, eh? Why would
you believe anything he says?

258
00:12:32,636 --> 00:12:34,637
I don't know. The way he said it.

259
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:37,640
The authority he said it with.
He's over there with...

260
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:40,351
- Who?
- Anjelica Huston and John Cusack.

261
00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:41,810
- Levy?
- Yep.

262
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:45,189
He's in over his head.
They're gonna drown over there.

263
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:47,858
Quite the golden boy at Fox these days.

264
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:50,110
Did you see that thing on him
in Variety?

265
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:51,820
- The big spread?
- Oh, two pages.

266
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:53,948
- Sure.
- Anjelica. Griffin Mill.

267
00:12:54,115 --> 00:12:55,324
- Oh, hi.
- Good to see you.

268
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:56,700
- You too.
- Looking great.

269
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,453
Hey, Johnny.
Griffin Mill, I'm a big fan of yours.

270
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:02,665
- Gonna be in Telluride this year?
- I'm probably gonna be in Park City.

271
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:06,043
- Oh, great. We'll see you there.
- Okay.

272
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,837
What's happening with Glass Box?

273
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:11,590
Can we talk about something
other than Hollywood for a change?

274
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,259
- Yes.
- We're educated people.

275
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:16,053
- Sure.
- Sure, Griffin.

276
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,226
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

277
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:56,302
Shouldn't you talk to somebody about this?

278
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:57,886
- What?
- These postcards.

279
00:13:58,054 --> 00:13:59,847
- You've gotten five in two weeks.
- Seven.

280
00:14:00,015 --> 00:14:02,516
Why don't you just talk
to studio security?

281
00:14:02,684 --> 00:14:04,935
I'm supposed to call
Walter Stuckel and say what?

282
00:14:05,103 --> 00:14:07,563
"Walter, listen, someone's sending me
poison pen letters...

283
00:14:07,731 --> 00:14:11,400
...and I would like for you to make me
the object of more ridicule and abuse...

284
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:14,737
...now that things are really shaky
for me." No, I don't think so.

285
00:14:14,904 --> 00:14:16,613
I think they're coming from a writer.

286
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,866
- Which one?
- Take your pick.

287
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:23,746
- Is there anything else?
- Yes, your attorney phoned.

288
00:14:23,913 --> 00:14:27,750
- Wants you to come to a party at his house.
- Get me out of it. I'm in a screening.

289
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,793
Not that attorney. It's Dick Mellen.

290
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,379
- Oh, Dick. What time?
- Cocktails at 7:30.

291
00:14:32,547 --> 00:14:33,881
Dinner at 8. Bring a date.

292
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:37,509
- And Bonnie Sherow is here to see you.
- One more sensitive male-bonding script.

293
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,553
Send her in. Oh, there she is.

294
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:42,556
Griffin, can we go
to the springs this weekend?

295
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:44,266
I wanna have a massage...

296
00:14:44,476 --> 00:14:47,353
...I wanna have a long soak
in a hot mineral tub...

297
00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:50,481
...and I wanna have margaritas
administered intravenously.

298
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,816
I have a party at Dick Mellen's.
Wanna come?

299
00:14:52,984 --> 00:14:56,779
- Oh, God, movie stars and power players.
- And vodka.

300
00:14:56,946 --> 00:14:58,364
Sure.

301
00:14:58,656 --> 00:15:01,617
It'll be an early dinner
and we'll go to my place afterwards.

302
00:15:01,826 --> 00:15:03,660
- Can we?
- Yeah.

303
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:20,177
Brokaw looks like
he has absolutely no retention.

304
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:23,597
Ted Koppel looks loose,
and he goes after it, and he digs in...

305
00:15:23,807 --> 00:15:26,141
...and he doesn't get thrown very easy.

306
00:15:27,477 --> 00:15:29,353
- You remember?
- Sure.

307
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:32,064
Hi. How are you? Ha, ha.

308
00:15:32,315 --> 00:15:34,316
- Marlee, this is Bonnie Sherow.
- Hi.

309
00:15:34,526 --> 00:15:36,944
- She read, um, Tales of Fury.
- How are you?

310
00:15:37,112 --> 00:15:40,656
- I loved it. I loved it. I read your script.
- That's great.

311
00:15:40,865 --> 00:15:43,534
It was wonderful.
And I think you're perfect for Ariel.

312
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:45,369
- Thank you.
- Perfect for the part.

313
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:49,415
Yeah. We're gonna make just
a couple of changes in the third act.

314
00:15:49,624 --> 00:15:51,583
- Just...
- You should set up a meeting.

315
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:52,835
Yeah.

316
00:15:53,044 --> 00:15:54,336
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, sure.

317
00:15:54,546 --> 00:15:56,088
- Yes.
- You have my number?

318
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,674
- Yes, absolutely.
- Yes, I'll speak to you next week.

319
00:15:58,842 --> 00:15:59,842
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

320
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:01,593
Go say hello to some people here.

321
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,887
You don't talk about script changes
at parties.

322
00:16:04,055 --> 00:16:05,180
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

323
00:16:05,348 --> 00:16:06,640
It was good of you to come.

324
00:16:06,808 --> 00:16:09,017
- Don't you look beautiful?
- Thank you.

325
00:16:09,227 --> 00:16:11,019
- You know Bonnie Sherow.
- Of course.

326
00:16:11,229 --> 00:16:13,355
How are you?
Good to see you. TriStar, right?

327
00:16:13,523 --> 00:16:15,357
- Watch your step.
- She's at the studio.

328
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:19,528
Yeah, that's what I meant.
How about...? Uh, bring Mr. Mill a martini.

329
00:16:19,696 --> 00:16:22,197
- Bunny, how about you?
- Actually, I'll take a Ramlösa.

330
00:16:22,365 --> 00:16:23,699
- I'll have a martini.
- Okay.

331
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:27,161
Okay. One of each. Rod Steiger's here.

332
00:16:27,328 --> 00:16:30,747
Why don't you, uh...? Why don't you
talk to him about the Rudolph project?

333
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:35,127
He's not that hot on it, but, uh, see if you
can get him to at least, you know, read it.

334
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:37,421
- Okay.
- You know who's here is Harry Belafonte.

335
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:39,173
- Harry?
- I love Harry Belafonte.

336
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,718
- I love him.
- Come and say hello. Harry, say hello.

337
00:16:42,886 --> 00:16:44,595
- Griffin Mill and Bunny.
- How are you?

338
00:16:44,762 --> 00:16:46,096
- Good to see you.
- Hi.

339
00:16:46,264 --> 00:16:48,390
- Bonnie Sherow.
- She's just gaga over you.

340
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:49,683
I'm a big fan of yours.

341
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:52,519
I saw you accept
the Nelson Mandela Courage Award.

342
00:16:53,563 --> 00:16:55,189
Who's the guy in Ghostbusters?

343
00:16:55,398 --> 00:16:57,566
Uh, you know, the villain in Ghostbusters.

344
00:16:57,734 --> 00:17:00,444
Uh... I... You got me. That wasn't...

345
00:17:00,904 --> 00:17:03,071
I got this, uh...

346
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:06,992
This p... I got this postcard.

347
00:17:07,202 --> 00:17:09,244
You know, harassment kind of...
But you know.

348
00:17:09,412 --> 00:17:12,498
I don't. Tell me,
what are you talking about?

349
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,959
Well, it's some writer
I must have brushed off.

350
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,628
Folks, get something to eat.

351
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:19,296
- Good idea.
- There's lovely stuff.

352
00:17:19,464 --> 00:17:21,757
- We will. In a few minutes.
- We're wasting away.

353
00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:23,926
- Your hands are as cold as mine.
- Freezing.

354
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:25,719
I think... Would you like one of these?

355
00:17:25,887 --> 00:17:28,597
- Um, I don't think I do.
- That one right there.

356
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:30,933
Not threats?
You talking about threats?

357
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,935
Well, no.

358
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:35,479
Y... Yes. I don't know.

359
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,272
He's pissed off.

360
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:39,274
I thought writers were your long suit.

361
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:41,944
You're the writer's executive,
aren't you?

362
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:43,820
Are you pitching me a dream? Ha, ha.

363
00:17:43,988 --> 00:17:45,989
The way you say that,
that makes me think...

364
00:17:46,157 --> 00:17:49,743
...you're not really interested.
- It depends how good the dream is, Jeff.

365
00:17:50,286 --> 00:17:51,995
Levy's here.

366
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,502
- People over there, okay?
- Dick, Dick. What's he doing here?

367
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,296
- Goldblum? He's a friend.
- No, Larry Levy.

368
00:18:01,464 --> 00:18:04,716
He came with Sally. He's a buddy...
- What's going on with my job?

369
00:18:04,968 --> 00:18:07,261
I mean, you know,
Larry Levy, everywhere I look.

370
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,638
- He's in my face.
- Larry Levy's a comer.

371
00:18:09,847 --> 00:18:12,474
That's what comers do,
they get in your face.

372
00:18:12,642 --> 00:18:15,602
You're a comer too. You can handle him.
Stop worrying about it.

373
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,688
So the rumors are true?

374
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:21,650
- Rumors are always true, you know that.
- I'm always the last to hear about them.

375
00:18:21,818 --> 00:18:24,987
You're the last one to believe.
I told you that before.

376
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:26,363
So am I out?

377
00:18:26,948 --> 00:18:29,283
Not out,
but start thinking about a roommate.

378
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,828
Relax, you can handle this.
You know, you can make him work for it.

379
00:18:32,996 --> 00:18:34,705
- Excuse me...
- Larry?

380
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:36,999
Dick. Sorry to crash your party.

381
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,835
- Do you know everybody?
- I will before the night's out.

382
00:18:40,003 --> 00:18:43,839
You will. You will indeed.
It's a good crowd of people.

383
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:48,552
- Great party, Dick.
- Good. Did you get some food?

384
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,345
- Actually, we're gonna...
- Not yet.

385
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:55,892
Listen to this. Listen to this.

386
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,770
"He lifts her dress.
She kisses him harder.

387
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:02,608
He puts his hands in her underpants.
She grabs his shoulders.

388
00:19:02,817 --> 00:19:04,651
He pulls her dress above her waist.

389
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:07,362
He rubs against her wide, soft belly.

390
00:19:07,572 --> 00:19:12,075
Slowly, he pushes her panties down to
her knees. She is faint with passion.

391
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:15,370
She arches her back and he lowers
her down onto the buckboard.

392
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,372
The horses snort and whinny.

393
00:19:17,582 --> 00:19:19,958
They too seem to be feeling
her passion.

394
00:19:20,168 --> 00:19:22,794
The camera moves in
on the nostrils of the horse...

395
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:27,049
...as the buckboard begins to shake."
Oh, my God.

396
00:19:27,216 --> 00:19:30,177
Can you believe that?
Steve recommended that script.

397
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:32,471
He says they're hot for it
over at Universal.

398
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:36,016
- They're gonna have a bidding war.
- I heard a pitch today. It wasn't bad.

399
00:19:36,184 --> 00:19:39,227
- I'm stuck on a story point though.
- I'm the story editor. Go.

400
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:42,064
New York City, Madison Avenue.
Big advertising agency.

401
00:19:42,231 --> 00:19:45,567
Account executive makes a presentation
to someone he wants as a client.

402
00:19:45,735 --> 00:19:47,903
The client promises to get back to him.

403
00:19:48,071 --> 00:19:50,739
- Does it have to be advertising?
- That's not the problem.

404
00:19:50,907 --> 00:19:54,534
The account executive keeps waiting
for the client to call him back...

405
00:19:54,702 --> 00:19:58,413
...to tell him what he thought of the idea,
tell him if he got the job or not...

406
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:00,457
...but the client never calls.

407
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:03,794
So the account executive
gets so pissed off, so frustrated...

408
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:07,923
...that he becomes obsessive,
and he decides to drive the client crazy.

409
00:20:08,132 --> 00:20:11,551
- What does he do?
- Sends him threatening postcards.

410
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:13,595
It's not important.

411
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,013
Here's the problem.

412
00:20:15,223 --> 00:20:21,144
How long do you think
the account executive harasses the client...

413
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,605
...before he becomes dangerous?

414
00:20:23,815 --> 00:20:26,692
- Does it have to be advertising?
- How long?

415
00:20:26,901 --> 00:20:29,319
All right, if it were me...

416
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:32,114
- One month?
- Three months.

417
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:33,782
No, no, no, more. Five months.

418
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,993
- To be dangerous, five months.
- Five months. That's what I thought.

419
00:20:37,161 --> 00:20:38,912
- Who's the writer?
- I don't know.

420
00:20:39,122 --> 00:20:42,040
You don't know the writer
who pitched you the idea?

421
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:46,169
I don't know his name. I don't know.
It's a couple of kids. Uh...

422
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:49,631
- TV writers.
- Hmm.

423
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,383
Can we go to bed now?

424
00:20:51,634 --> 00:20:54,302
I'm starting to wrinkle.

425
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,228
- See you tomorrow afternoon.
- Absolutely.

426
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:05,480
Burt. Larry Levy.
I hope you don't remember me.

427
00:21:05,648 --> 00:21:07,649
If you do,
I hope there are no hard feelings.

428
00:21:07,817 --> 00:21:10,652
- I was only working for Kastner at the time.
- Yeah, right.

429
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:17,743
- Bye.
- Take care.

430
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,579
- Who's that?
- Uh, an exec over at Fox.

431
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:22,789
- Or was until this breakfast anyways.
- Yeah.

432
00:21:31,507 --> 00:21:36,094
- Morning, Mr. Mill. Welcome to Geoffrey's.
- Hi, Susan. How are you? I'm with Joel.

433
00:21:36,846 --> 00:21:38,096
Hi, Burt. Griffin Mill.

434
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:39,806
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

435
00:21:40,016 --> 00:21:42,184
Griffin. Nice to see you this morning.
Bye-bye.

436
00:21:42,351 --> 00:21:46,062
- Asshole.
- Ha, ha. One of a breed, yes.

437
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:49,816
Actually, he's not one of a breed.
There's a whole breed of them.

438
00:21:49,984 --> 00:21:52,694
- They're breeding them actually.
- You're losing your touch.

439
00:21:52,862 --> 00:21:56,865
Scheduling these meetings so close together.
Guy didn't have time to finish breakfast.

440
00:21:57,033 --> 00:22:00,118
- He'd already eaten. Gets up early.
- Yeah.

441
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:03,622
- You went to Mellen's last night.
- Would you take this away? Yes, I did.

442
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,416
- How is he?
- I would like a Vittel water.

443
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:09,461
He's fine.

444
00:22:09,712 --> 00:22:11,713
You left early, why?

445
00:22:12,006 --> 00:22:15,550
We had to work on the, uh...
On the museum party.

446
00:22:16,052 --> 00:22:18,595
I will not work for Larry Levy.

447
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:20,889
I'm not asking you to.

448
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:26,228
I report to you.
If I have to report to Larry Levy, I quit.

449
00:22:28,189 --> 00:22:29,606
You can't quit.

450
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:33,193
I won't let you quit.
You have a year and a half on your contract.

451
00:22:33,361 --> 00:22:38,490
And I will sue you for breach if you don't
show up in the office every day with a smile.

452
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,034
Why Levy?

453
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:46,331
Levy was available. He's good on
material, you're good with writers.

454
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:50,001
We're a team. He's a new member
of the team, that's all.

455
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:53,547
- He can make us all look good.
- This is a red-wine glass.

456
00:22:53,714 --> 00:22:56,508
Can I have my water
in a water glass, please?

457
00:22:56,884 --> 00:22:58,260
Well?

458
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,388
I'll have to think about it, Joel.

459
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:03,306
I want an answer this afternoon.

460
00:23:03,641 --> 00:23:05,976
Well, I have to go out to Palmdale.

461
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:09,646
The director of The Lonely Room
is giving Lily a hard time.

462
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:11,648
I'll be back around 5.

463
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:14,985
- So call after 5.
- I'll get back to you.

464
00:23:15,152 --> 00:23:18,572
But I said, "You know, you
haven't gone... You haven't died enough."

465
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:20,657
So he's still hanging on.

466
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,588
- Griffin.
- Yeah.

467
00:23:34,755 --> 00:23:37,549
- Joel Levison on Line 2. Put him through?
- No. I'll get back to him.

468
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:39,467
Tell Joel Levison
you'll get back to him?

469
00:23:39,635 --> 00:23:41,094
- Yeah.
- Yes, sir.

470
00:23:41,262 --> 00:23:43,513
I wanna hear what he's gotta say.

471
00:23:52,857 --> 00:23:55,817
- How did this get here?
- The mail.

472
00:23:56,027 --> 00:23:58,820
But this does not have a postmark.
This was hand-delivered.

473
00:23:59,155 --> 00:24:02,574
Not to me. It came with the mail.
Jimmy?

474
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:04,492
Huh?

475
00:24:04,952 --> 00:24:08,038
You know anything about this?
Who delivered it, where it came from?

476
00:24:09,332 --> 00:24:10,373
Mailroom?

477
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:13,001
But I wanna know how it got
to the goddamn mailroom.

478
00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:14,961
Find out for me and get back to me.

479
00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:16,838
- Okay, sure.
- You go with him.

480
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:21,176
- You want me to go to the mailroom?
- Yes. I want you to go to the mailroom.

481
00:24:21,344 --> 00:24:25,555
And while you're there, I would like a, uh,
copy of The Lonely Room rewrites.

482
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:28,099
In white pages, no color.

483
00:24:28,351 --> 00:24:30,894
- And find out how this got in my mail.
- Yes, sir.

484
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:35,357
- You'll get your own phones, I take it?
- Yes, I can get my own phone, Jan.

485
00:24:41,822 --> 00:24:43,740
Son of a bitch. Five months.

486
00:24:43,908 --> 00:24:48,662
One, two, three, four, five. April.

487
00:24:50,247 --> 00:24:52,123
"Pitches. Richard Fielder, David Lucas...

488
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:55,377
...Adam Silverstein...

489
00:24:56,587 --> 00:24:58,380
...Bill Lindstrom, David Kahane...

490
00:24:58,547 --> 00:25:00,674
...Sandra Potenza."

491
00:25:06,055 --> 00:25:08,014
Incoming.

492
00:25:11,394 --> 00:25:14,771
Incoming. Unreturned calls.

493
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:17,732
Bill Lindstrom again.

494
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:22,195
Nancy Franklin. Wouldn't be a woman.
Wouldn't be a woman. David Kahane.

495
00:25:23,906 --> 00:25:28,493
Oh, come on. Sort, sort, sort. Come on.

496
00:25:30,955 --> 00:25:34,791
Come on. Kahane, Kahane, Kahane.
Lindstrom. Lindstrom. White pages.

497
00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:40,005
Lindstrom. Disney, strategic planning.

498
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:44,259
It wouldn't be him.
And what was that other guy's name?

499
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,221
Kahane. Kahane. J-K.

500
00:25:48,431 --> 00:25:50,265
"Kalchime.

501
00:25:50,474 --> 00:25:51,933
Kahane."

502
00:25:52,143 --> 00:25:54,227
Unproduced. Got you!

503
00:26:51,994 --> 00:26:55,121
- Hello?
- Yes. Is David Kahane there, please?

504
00:26:55,331 --> 00:26:56,372
David?

505
00:27:01,045 --> 00:27:02,670
Dave?

506
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,716
Hello? I'm really sorry, I forgot.
He's gone out.

507
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:08,176
- Oh, I see.
- Who's this?

508
00:27:08,385 --> 00:27:10,220
This is Griffin Mill.

509
00:27:10,513 --> 00:27:13,890
- Oh, the dead man.
- What did you just say?

510
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,559
- About... About me being a dead man.
- Oh, nothing.

511
00:27:16,811 --> 00:27:20,605
Just a nickname David has for you.

512
00:27:20,815 --> 00:27:24,484
Oh, I see. That's a funny nickname.

513
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:28,154
So I suppose your husband
doesn't like me very much.

514
00:27:28,697 --> 00:27:30,740
I don't have a husband.

515
00:27:30,908 --> 00:27:32,992
I suppose David doesn't like me
very much.

516
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,411
David's, uh, gone to the cinema.

517
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:37,247
When will he be back?

518
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,457
When the film's over, I presume.

519
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:41,960
And you are?

520
00:27:42,586 --> 00:27:45,171
- June.
- June...

521
00:27:45,381 --> 00:27:47,590
Here we go.
You want to know my last name.

522
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,884
You won't be able to pronounce it.
No one can.

523
00:27:50,052 --> 00:27:53,138
- Try me.
- Gudmundsdottir.

524
00:27:53,347 --> 00:27:54,681
Goodmanzdaughter.

525
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:58,059
- Gudmundsdottir.
- Gudmundsdottir.

526
00:27:58,269 --> 00:28:00,895
- How's that?
- Hey, you're very good.

527
00:28:01,063 --> 00:28:02,647
Thanks.

528
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:06,151
What do people usually say?

529
00:28:06,777 --> 00:28:12,699
Don't ask. Like anything
from Goodogzwater to Goulashwallop.

530
00:28:14,535 --> 00:28:15,869
You English?

531
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:19,080
Yeah. Well, no, no, not really.

532
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:22,125
Well, where are you
kind of sort of not from?

533
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:26,087
Well, do you want the long story
or the short one?

534
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,464
- The long one.
- No, you'd never believe it.

535
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:30,633
The short one's Iceland.

536
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:32,427
Iceland.

537
00:28:32,636 --> 00:28:36,222
I didn't know anyone came from Iceland.
I thought it was just a block of ice.

538
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,641
It's very green, actually.

539
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:41,102
Really? I thought that was Greenland.

540
00:28:41,312 --> 00:28:45,607
No. Greenland's very icy.
Iceland's very green.

541
00:28:46,025 --> 00:28:49,777
They switched names to fool the Vikings,
who were trying to steal their women.

542
00:28:49,987 --> 00:28:51,029
Oh, I see.

543
00:28:51,238 --> 00:28:54,032
No. Blue sea.

544
00:28:54,241 --> 00:28:56,034
- Red sea.
- No, no, no.

545
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:59,287
- No red.
- You're a painter.

546
00:28:59,455 --> 00:29:01,497
How did you guess?

547
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:05,501
So, what movie did David go to see?

548
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:09,255
Um, he went to the Rialto in Pasadena.
He always goes there.

549
00:29:09,465 --> 00:29:11,216
What's showing?

550
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:14,636
Bicycle Thief, I think.

551
00:29:15,638 --> 00:29:17,931
It's a good movie. Have you seen it?

552
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:21,476
No, I don't go to the movies.

553
00:29:21,644 --> 00:29:23,853
You don't? Why not?

554
00:29:25,814 --> 00:29:27,523
Oh...

555
00:29:30,945 --> 00:29:33,154
Life is too short.

556
00:29:33,447 --> 00:29:35,698
I've gotta hang up now.

557
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:02,827
David Kahane.

558
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:05,246
No, you have the wrong guy, man.

559
00:31:22,306 --> 00:31:24,932
- You didn't like it?
- It's a foreign film.

560
00:31:26,602 --> 00:31:30,146
David Kahane. Griffin Mill.

561
00:31:30,981 --> 00:31:34,525
Griffin Mill. Yeah?

562
00:31:34,735 --> 00:31:36,903
Great movie, huh?

563
00:31:37,071 --> 00:31:41,032
It's so refreshing to see something
like this after all these cop movies...

564
00:31:41,241 --> 00:31:45,078
...and, you know, things we do.

565
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:47,038
Maybe we'll do a remake of this.

566
00:31:47,247 --> 00:31:50,541
- You'd probably give it a happy ending.
- Oh, no, no. We'd keep it pure.

567
00:31:50,751 --> 00:31:52,627
Sure, right.

568
00:31:52,795 --> 00:31:54,462
Do you wanna write it?

569
00:31:55,339 --> 00:31:57,507
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm not fucking with you.

570
00:31:57,716 --> 00:32:01,386
- I said that I'd get back to you, didn't I?
- Yeah. About six months ago.

571
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:03,721
- I thought you'd forgotten.
- You were angry.

572
00:32:05,766 --> 00:32:08,351
- Maybe.
- Do you wanna talk about it?

573
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:11,896
- Okay, sure.
- Great.

574
00:32:12,648 --> 00:32:15,233
Let's let the studio buy us a drink.

575
00:32:17,611 --> 00:32:21,489
Well, if you don't mind a place where you
don't have any suck with the maître d'...

576
00:32:21,698 --> 00:32:24,784
...I know a bar down the street.
- Let's go.

577
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,168
Have you ever been to Japan?

578
00:32:34,378 --> 00:32:38,631
Yes, I was there once
on a location scout with Steven Spielberg.

579
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,967
I lived there for a year.

580
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:43,261
- Student year abroad.
- Great.

581
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,222
You know, I wish I'd done that.

582
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:49,684
Well, I think about it a lot.
I'll never forget it.

583
00:32:49,852 --> 00:32:51,811
You should write about it.

584
00:32:52,354 --> 00:32:55,356
I did. Don't you remember?

585
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:57,650
What?

586
00:32:59,903 --> 00:33:04,699
My idea about the American
student who goes to Japan.

587
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:08,202
That was my pitch, the one you
were supposed to get back to me on.

588
00:33:08,412 --> 00:33:09,495
You don't remember, do you?

589
00:33:10,873 --> 00:33:12,748
Of course I remember.

590
00:33:13,917 --> 00:33:15,126
You never got back to me.

591
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:17,920
Listen.

592
00:33:18,464 --> 00:33:21,966
I was an asshole, all right?

593
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,634
It comes with the job.

594
00:33:24,011 --> 00:33:26,429
I'm sorry, I really am.

595
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:30,308
I know how angry you must've been.

596
00:33:30,517 --> 00:33:32,977
I'll make it up to you.
That's what I'm here for.

597
00:33:33,687 --> 00:33:36,063
I wanna give you a deal, David.

598
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:40,943
I'm not gonna guarantee I'm gonna make
the movie, but I am gonna give you a shot.

599
00:33:43,614 --> 00:33:48,576
Let's just, um, stop all the postcard shit,
all right?

600
00:33:49,286 --> 00:33:51,871
I'm here to say that I would like...

601
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:54,081
...to start over.

602
00:33:55,626 --> 00:33:56,667
Friends.

603
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:58,711
Let's begin again

604
00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:03,633
- Fuck you, Mill. You're a liar.
- You're stepping over the line, David.

605
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,927
You didn't come here
to see The Bicycle Thief.

606
00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:09,096
You came in five minutes
before the picture ended.

607
00:34:09,306 --> 00:34:11,641
You nearly tripped over my feet.

608
00:34:13,393 --> 00:34:16,812
What'd you do, call my house? Huh?

609
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:18,773
Did you speak to the ice queen?

610
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:23,778
You'd like her, Mill. She's a lot like you.

611
00:34:24,404 --> 00:34:26,280
All heart.

612
00:34:27,491 --> 00:34:31,285
Before love had really taken hold

613
00:34:31,453 --> 00:34:33,746
You're on my list, pal.

614
00:34:34,081 --> 00:34:35,540
Nothing's gonna change that.

615
00:34:39,586 --> 00:34:41,128
See you in the next reel, asshole.

616
00:34:41,296 --> 00:34:43,089
Let's start over from the start

617
00:34:43,799 --> 00:34:46,300
Let's forget the time

618
00:34:46,468 --> 00:34:49,095
That you nearly broke my heart

619
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:53,891
Go everywhere we've been again

620
00:34:54,268 --> 00:34:58,604
Let's begin again

621
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:18,207
Let's begin again

622
00:35:19,459 --> 00:35:22,253
Let's start over from the start

623
00:35:30,971 --> 00:35:34,223
That's a nice boat
you got there, movie exec.

624
00:35:34,891 --> 00:35:38,019
It's me, the writer.
You still wanna buy my story?

625
00:35:38,186 --> 00:35:40,855
I told you I'd give you a deal.
Stop by the studio in the morning.

626
00:35:41,064 --> 00:35:44,483
- We'll work something out.
- And who will I ask for?

627
00:35:44,901 --> 00:35:46,819
Larry Levy?

628
00:35:48,572 --> 00:35:50,406
What's Larry Levy got to do with this?

629
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:53,659
- How you know about Levy?
- Don't you read the trades?

630
00:35:53,827 --> 00:35:56,871
New York Times business section?
He's moving in, you're moving out.

631
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:59,040
You can't make a deal,
that's what they say.

632
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:02,710
- Yesterday's news.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

633
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,796
Can I borrow your mobile phone? Huh?

634
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:09,216
Hi. Larry Levy.
Yeah, Larry, David Kahane here.

635
00:36:09,426 --> 00:36:11,969
Listen, Larry,
guess who's making promises...

636
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:16,057
...about getting pictures made
to writers in parking lots.

637
00:36:16,558 --> 00:36:19,143
Guess what dumb,
son-of-a-bitch executive...

638
00:36:19,353 --> 00:36:23,105
...is trying to take advantage of me.

639
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:26,984
I mean, do you realize
how unstoppable this guy is?

640
00:36:27,194 --> 00:36:31,030
You know, I cannot wait
to tell the world...

641
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:34,659
...that when Griffin Mill
can't cut the pressure at work...

642
00:36:35,118 --> 00:36:37,703
...he drives out to Pasadena...

643
00:36:37,871 --> 00:36:40,790
...to pick fights with writers!

644
00:36:42,209 --> 00:36:43,959
You tell Larry Levy to give me a call.

645
00:36:44,127 --> 00:36:47,213
The word is out that he's gonna
start making meaningful pictures...

646
00:36:47,381 --> 00:36:49,298
...at the studio for a change.

647
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:52,551
Let's... Let's forget this.
Just stop all the postcard shit.

648
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,553
- I don't write postcards!
- Let's forget this!

649
00:36:54,721 --> 00:36:56,597
- I write scripts!
- We're both wrong! Okay?

650
00:36:56,765 --> 00:36:59,433
No, you're wrong, buddy.
You're in over your head.

651
00:36:59,601 --> 00:37:03,437
That's why you're losing your job.
And then what are you gonna do?

652
00:37:03,605 --> 00:37:06,941
Huh? I can write. What can you do?

653
00:37:11,613 --> 00:37:13,864
I said, let's forget this.

654
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,913
Ah, shit.

655
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:26,627
Mill, you okay? Are you all right?

656
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:38,889
Keep it to yourself!

657
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:41,892
Keep it to yourself.

658
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,751
Kahane?

659
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:28,499
You know what's interesting?

660
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:30,668
I mean, who's writing this new ending?

661
00:39:30,836 --> 00:39:32,920
Who wrote the new ending
of Fatal Attraction?

662
00:39:33,088 --> 00:39:34,505
- The audience.
- In that case...

663
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:37,383
A million-plus screenwriters,
the audience wrote that ending.

664
00:39:37,551 --> 00:39:40,761
Who's to say what it would have
done if you left the original ending?

665
00:39:40,971 --> 00:39:42,388
- You can't say.
- You're right.

666
00:39:42,556 --> 00:39:45,140
But you can say that
it's done 300 million worldwide...

667
00:39:45,308 --> 00:39:47,768
...with the ending selected
from the test screening.

668
00:39:48,603 --> 00:39:51,689
Larry, I don't believe that
you've met my assistant, Whitney Gersh.

669
00:39:51,898 --> 00:39:54,400
- No, I haven't.
- It's a great pleasure to meet you.

670
00:39:56,611 --> 00:39:58,571
- What are you doing?
- How's your picture?

671
00:39:58,738 --> 00:40:00,865
- It just tested last week.
- Doing well.

672
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:02,867
- How well?
- It was our first test.

673
00:40:03,076 --> 00:40:04,618
Excuse me, Walter.

674
00:40:04,786 --> 00:40:09,164
Um, Joel, Griffin still isn't in, but I really
think we have to start this meeting.

675
00:40:09,332 --> 00:40:11,917
Okay, Celia. Thank you.

676
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:16,338
You remember a movie called D.O.A.?

677
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:18,799
Sure I do.
Eddie O'Brien and Pam Britton.

678
00:40:18,967 --> 00:40:22,136
Disney did a remake in '87 or '88.

679
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:25,139
Yeah, well, I think we got, uh,
pretty much the same situation.

680
00:40:25,307 --> 00:40:27,808
Keep our noses clean, Walter.

681
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:33,731
It's a shame to waste the picture.
It's a great picture.

682
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:35,983
- It's a great story.
- Who said we're wasting it?

683
00:40:36,151 --> 00:40:39,320
- Where did that come from?
- You know what's interesting?

684
00:40:39,487 --> 00:40:42,990
- We're all too busy to go see movies...
- Griffin, you're really late.

685
00:40:43,158 --> 00:40:45,284
- They're waiting inside.
- You ought to try it.

686
00:40:45,452 --> 00:40:48,370
- What's this?
- It's a script from Todd Smith.

687
00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:52,333
We need to give them
the kind of pictures they want...

688
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,668
...not the kind these writers
wanna give them.

689
00:40:54,878 --> 00:40:58,130
I know you guys
spend a lot of time with writers.

690
00:40:58,298 --> 00:41:01,967
- Believe me, you have my deepest sympathy.
- Excuse me.

691
00:41:02,177 --> 00:41:05,930
- Hello. Sorry I'm late.
- You certainly are.

692
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:09,016
- Jan, can I talk to you, please?
- Yeah.

693
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:11,518
Just a couple minutes
in your office is fine.

694
00:41:12,395 --> 00:41:17,274
Griffin, you missed the formal
welcoming ceremony. You know Larry Levy.

695
00:41:17,901 --> 00:41:19,985
Of course. Hi, Larry.

696
00:41:21,655 --> 00:41:23,530
- Hi.
- Larry was able to get out of Fox...

697
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:26,992
...earlier than he thought
and has come aboard as of this morning.

698
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,329
Great. Well, let's, uh... Let's start.

699
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:33,248
- Larry was in the middle of something.
- No. I wasn't.

700
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:35,668
I was just killing time waiting for Griffin.

701
00:41:35,877 --> 00:41:38,837
Well, no. Finish. What were you saying?

702
00:41:39,047 --> 00:41:41,548
I was just saying that
I've yet to meet a writer...

703
00:41:41,758 --> 00:41:46,053
...who could change water into wine, and
we have a tendency to treat them like that.

704
00:41:46,388 --> 00:41:48,639
- As soon as you're finished.
- Not at this studio.

705
00:41:49,391 --> 00:41:52,142
Million, million and a half
for these scripts. It's...

706
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,394
It's nuts.

707
00:41:53,895 --> 00:41:55,854
And I think avoidable.

708
00:41:56,773 --> 00:41:59,858
When was the last time you actually
bought a ticket to see a movie?

709
00:42:00,026 --> 00:42:02,903
- Actually paid your own money to see it?
- Last night.

710
00:42:03,905 --> 00:42:05,864
Pasadena. The Bicycle Thief.

711
00:42:06,032 --> 00:42:09,410
- You went to see The Bicycle Thief?
- I love that film. It's a great film.

712
00:42:09,577 --> 00:42:13,080
It's art movie. Doesn't count.
We're talking about "movie" movies.

713
00:42:13,248 --> 00:42:14,289
Jesus, people.

714
00:42:14,457 --> 00:42:17,459
All I'm saying is I think
a lot of time and money can be saved...

715
00:42:17,627 --> 00:42:19,878
...if we came up with these stories
on our own.

716
00:42:20,046 --> 00:42:21,755
Where are these stories coming from?

717
00:42:21,923 --> 00:42:24,383
Anywhere, anywhere.
It doesn't matter. Anywhere. Um...

718
00:42:24,592 --> 00:42:27,428
The newspaper. Pick a story. Any story.

719
00:42:29,055 --> 00:42:30,514
All right.

720
00:42:30,807 --> 00:42:33,934
"Immigrants Protest Budget Cuts
in Literacy Program."

721
00:42:34,102 --> 00:42:37,563
Human spirit overcoming adversity.
Horatio Alger in the barrio.

722
00:42:37,731 --> 00:42:40,441
Put Jimmy Smits in it
and you got a sexy Stand and Deliver.

723
00:42:40,608 --> 00:42:43,902
- Next. Come on.
- Larry, this isn't my field.

724
00:42:44,112 --> 00:42:47,156
Marty, it doesn't matter.
Just give it a shot. You can't lose here.

725
00:42:47,323 --> 00:42:49,283
Okay.

726
00:42:49,743 --> 00:42:53,787
How about, uh,
"Mudslide Kills 60 in Slums of Chili"?

727
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:57,583
That's good. Triumph over tragedy.
Sounds like a John Boorman picture.

728
00:42:57,792 --> 00:43:00,669
You slap a happy ending on it,
the script will write itself.

729
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,757
- Bon. Here, give me the paper.
- Gee, I don't know, Lar.

730
00:43:04,966 --> 00:43:06,550
Give it a shot.

731
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:11,680
"Further Bond Losses
Push Dow Down 7. 15."

732
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,725
- Okay.
- I see Connery as Bond.

733
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:17,519
Funny. A good thing Oliver Stone
wasn't listening to you.

734
00:43:17,687 --> 00:43:20,147
- Where would we have been?
- We would have been spared...

735
00:43:20,315 --> 00:43:22,107
...having to sit through Wall Street.

736
00:43:22,275 --> 00:43:24,318
Marty, what did Wall Street do worldwide?

737
00:43:24,486 --> 00:43:27,029
Seventy, 75, maybe 80.

738
00:43:27,197 --> 00:43:30,449
Eighty million dollars,
a couple of Oscars. Nothing to sneeze at.

739
00:43:30,617 --> 00:43:33,827
Okay. I think Larry's point is well taken.
Let's move on now.

740
00:43:33,995 --> 00:43:37,748
Griffin, uh, can you give us an update
on the Taylor Hackford project?

741
00:43:38,166 --> 00:43:39,750
Griffin?

742
00:43:40,168 --> 00:43:41,627
Yeah.

743
00:43:42,879 --> 00:43:46,715
I was just thinking what an interesting
concept it is to eliminate the writer...

744
00:43:46,925 --> 00:43:50,260
...from the artistic process.

745
00:43:50,845 --> 00:43:55,224
If we can just get rid of these actors and
directors, maybe we got something here.

746
00:44:01,189 --> 00:44:02,648
Hello, Walter.

747
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:06,026
- Make yourself at home.
- Mr. Mill.

748
00:44:06,194 --> 00:44:08,862
I understand you were kind of late
coming in this morning.

749
00:44:09,197 --> 00:44:12,533
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

750
00:44:12,742 --> 00:44:15,035
Appreciate your concern.

751
00:44:16,371 --> 00:44:18,664
What can I do for you, Walter?

752
00:44:18,873 --> 00:44:22,042
Don't tell me you came here
to pitch me a story.

753
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:24,837
Ha, ha.
That's exactly what I've come to do.

754
00:44:25,004 --> 00:44:30,050
It's a good one too. It's about a writer.
Sort of. David Kahane.

755
00:44:32,554 --> 00:44:33,595
David Kahane.

756
00:44:33,805 --> 00:44:36,598
- Who's David Kahane?
- Oh, you met him.

757
00:44:37,183 --> 00:44:38,559
Well, I meet a lot of writers.

758
00:44:39,018 --> 00:44:41,979
Uh-huh. But this particular writer
that you met was murdered last night...

759
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:45,816
...in back of the Rialto Theater in Pasadena.
- Murdered?

760
00:44:46,276 --> 00:44:49,903
Well, come to think of it,
Pasadena's as good a place to die as any.

761
00:44:51,698 --> 00:44:53,240
So, what's the story?

762
00:44:53,449 --> 00:44:55,409
Twenty-five words or less?

763
00:44:55,618 --> 00:44:58,745
Okay. Movie exec calls writer.

764
00:44:58,913 --> 00:45:02,624
Writer's girlfriend says he's at the movies.
Exec got to the movies, meets writer...

765
00:45:02,792 --> 00:45:07,212
...drinks with writer. Writer gets conked
and dies in 4 inches of dirty water.

766
00:45:07,422 --> 00:45:09,756
Movie exec is in deep shit.

767
00:45:10,925 --> 00:45:12,634
What do you think?

768
00:45:12,969 --> 00:45:15,929
That's more than 25 words
and it's bullshit.

769
00:45:17,307 --> 00:45:20,434
Pasadena Homicide doesn't think
it's bullshit. They got a complete report.

770
00:45:21,269 --> 00:45:24,521
You met Kahane at the Rialto.
You got drunk with him at a restaurant.

771
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:27,941
He left before you did.
That's the last time anyone saw him alive...

772
00:45:28,109 --> 00:45:29,943
...except you maybe.

773
00:45:30,236 --> 00:45:32,321
Why are you denying this?

774
00:45:33,156 --> 00:45:36,533
Well, what do the police think?

775
00:45:36,784 --> 00:45:40,787
They think it's a botched robbery.
You know...

776
00:45:41,122 --> 00:45:42,623
...window of his car was busted.

777
00:45:42,832 --> 00:45:45,959
He surprised someone
trying to take the radio.

778
00:45:46,169 --> 00:45:48,503
There was a fight, he was killed.

779
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,797
I didn't kill him, Walter...

780
00:45:51,674 --> 00:45:53,634
...but I went to see him.

781
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:56,136
I know I said I didn't, but I did.

782
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:59,890
- Why'd you lie to me?
- Well...

783
00:46:00,141 --> 00:46:02,351
...now's not a very good time for me.

784
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,896
Haven't you heard the rumors?
I'm on my way out.

785
00:46:06,147 --> 00:46:08,982
Just what I need,
a little more controversy.

786
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:10,776
Just not a good time, Walter.

787
00:46:12,153 --> 00:46:13,779
Look.

788
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:17,991
I am in charge of studio security
in every definition of the word...

789
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:21,536
...which means it is my job
to take care of a studio executive...

790
00:46:21,788 --> 00:46:25,457
...should he be, uh, shall we say,
under suspicion of murder...

791
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:29,503
...at a time when profits are down and
the company is vulnerable for a takeover.

792
00:46:29,712 --> 00:46:32,798
It is my job to keep this
very, very, very, very quiet!

793
00:46:34,175 --> 00:46:35,884
You wanna help?

794
00:46:36,386 --> 00:46:39,179
- Of course.
- Then stop lying.

795
00:46:40,014 --> 00:46:42,849
- How many meetings did you have?
- One.

796
00:46:43,059 --> 00:46:45,686
- Not counting last night?
- Not counting last night.

797
00:46:45,853 --> 00:46:48,021
Why'd you go all the way
to Pasadena to meet?

798
00:46:48,189 --> 00:46:51,024
He had an idea I was interested in.
I wanted to talk to him.

799
00:46:51,192 --> 00:46:52,359
His girlfriend.

800
00:46:52,568 --> 00:46:55,696
I guess she was a friend of yours too.
Think fast!

801
00:46:55,863 --> 00:46:58,532
Jesus Christ, Walter,
what do you think? What is this?

802
00:46:58,741 --> 00:47:01,827
The third degree. If you don't like it,
wait till the police start asking.

803
00:47:01,995 --> 00:47:03,954
- I'll go right now.
- They'll be a lot less polite!

804
00:47:04,122 --> 00:47:07,749
- You come with me!
- You're acting like someone's who's guilty.

805
00:47:08,084 --> 00:47:09,710
You're not guilty, are you?

806
00:47:10,044 --> 00:47:12,045
For the last time, I'm not a murderer.

807
00:47:29,397 --> 00:47:31,148
Bad news?

808
00:47:31,899 --> 00:47:35,485
- What?
- The fax. Is it bad news?

809
00:47:35,737 --> 00:47:36,862
No.

810
00:47:38,448 --> 00:47:39,865
Business as usual.

811
00:47:41,451 --> 00:47:44,953
The Hollywood system
did not murder David Kahane.

812
00:47:45,371 --> 00:47:48,415
Not the $98-million movie,
not the $12-million actor.

813
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:54,087
Not even the million-dollar deal
that David Kahane never landed.

814
00:47:54,255 --> 00:48:00,510
No, the most that we can pin on Hollywood
is assault with intent to kill.

815
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:05,891
Because society is responsible
for this particular murder...

816
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:11,688
...and it is to society that we must look
if we are to have any justice for that crime.

817
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:14,149
Because someone in the night...

818
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:19,613
...killed David Kahane, and that person
will have to bear the guilt.

819
00:48:20,823 --> 00:48:26,703
And if David were here right now,
I know in my heart that he would say:

820
00:48:27,413 --> 00:48:29,956
"Cut the shit, Phil.

821
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:34,169
What did you learn from all of this?
Did you learn anything from this?"

822
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:37,381
And I'd say,
"Uh, yeah, David, uh, I've learned a lot.

823
00:48:37,548 --> 00:48:40,467
We here, uh... We'll take it from here."

824
00:48:40,843 --> 00:48:44,638
And the next time we sell a script
for a million dollars...

825
00:48:44,931 --> 00:48:48,308
...the next time we nail some
shit-bag producer to the wall, we'll say:

826
00:48:48,476 --> 00:48:50,811
"That's another one for David Kahane."

827
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,735
David was working on something the day
he died. I'd, uh, like to share it with you.

828
00:48:59,654 --> 00:49:02,656
"Blackness. A mangy dog barks.

829
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:08,453
Garbage can lids are lifted
as derelicts in the street hunt for food.

830
00:49:08,663 --> 00:49:11,081
Buzzing, as a cheap alarm clock
goes off.

831
00:49:11,457 --> 00:49:14,584
Interior. Flophouse room. Early morning.

832
00:49:14,836 --> 00:49:17,838
A tracking shot moves
through the grimy room.

833
00:49:18,047 --> 00:49:21,550
Light streams in through holes
in the yellowing window shades.

834
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:24,344
Moths dance in the beams of light.

835
00:49:24,554 --> 00:49:27,681
Track down along the floor.
The frayed rug.

836
00:49:27,849 --> 00:49:30,725
Stop on an old shoe.

837
00:49:30,977 --> 00:49:32,602
It's empty."

838
00:49:37,233 --> 00:49:39,025
That's as far as he got.

839
00:49:40,236 --> 00:49:42,529
That's the last thing he wrote.

840
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:45,407
So long, Dave.

841
00:49:46,075 --> 00:49:47,742
Fade out.

842
00:49:48,453 --> 00:49:49,703
Thank you.

843
00:50:05,928 --> 00:50:09,222
Who are you? You're not a writer.

844
00:50:10,141 --> 00:50:12,392
No. I'm Griffin Mill.

845
00:50:12,602 --> 00:50:17,230
- We spoke the night David was...
- Blue sea, white sea. Yes.

846
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,982
It turned out you were right.

847
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:21,943
- What?
- It was a red sea.

848
00:50:22,528 --> 00:50:24,905
Oh. Yeah.

849
00:50:26,532 --> 00:50:29,159
You're the only person I know here.

850
00:50:29,744 --> 00:50:32,454
Listen, I'm really sorry about David.

851
00:50:32,747 --> 00:50:34,539
He was, uh...

852
00:50:34,957 --> 00:50:36,708
...a talent.

853
00:50:37,043 --> 00:50:39,085
You really think so?

854
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,130
I always suspected he was...

855
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:45,842
...uniquely untalented.

856
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:48,094
It's nice of you to say that.

857
00:50:48,262 --> 00:50:51,556
- Nice of you to come. You didn't have to.
- Well, I did.

858
00:50:51,933 --> 00:50:55,602
You know, I was probably
the last person to see him alive.

859
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:58,146
Yeah. The police told me.

860
00:50:58,606 --> 00:51:02,192
- Well, not quite the last, surely.
- No.

861
00:51:03,819 --> 00:51:06,780
I'm sure this is a terrible time for you.

862
00:51:07,114 --> 00:51:09,157
Is there anything you need or?

863
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:11,576
No, really. I...

864
00:51:11,744 --> 00:51:13,995
I don't feel bad.

865
00:51:14,205 --> 00:51:16,957
It's like when my parents died.

866
00:51:17,124 --> 00:51:21,378
I didn't feel anything at all.
They were just gone.

867
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:25,507
Well, I'm sure it hasn't sunk in yet.

868
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:28,969
- That was years ago.
- No, I meant David.

869
00:51:29,136 --> 00:51:30,387
Oh.

870
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:32,013
Oh, God.

871
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:35,225
These people. I don't like it here.

872
00:51:35,476 --> 00:51:41,648
They're all expecting me to grieve
and mourn, and I can't talk to them.

873
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:45,318
David's gone...

874
00:51:45,653 --> 00:51:47,988
...and I'm somewhere else already.

875
00:51:48,322 --> 00:51:51,116
- Will you take me home?
- What?

876
00:51:51,284 --> 00:51:53,243
Will you take me home?

877
00:51:54,036 --> 00:51:57,038
Sure. I'm right here.

878
00:52:33,909 --> 00:52:36,202
These are very interesting. I like them.

879
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:40,040
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks.

880
00:52:40,374 --> 00:52:42,417
- Where do you show?
- Hmm?

881
00:52:42,585 --> 00:52:43,710
Gallery. What gallery?

882
00:52:43,878 --> 00:52:46,546
- Who's your dealer?
- I don't have a dealer.

883
00:52:46,756 --> 00:52:49,090
I couldn't sell these.
They're never finished.

884
00:52:49,258 --> 00:52:50,884
Bicky?

885
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:54,179
No, thanks. They're never finished?

886
00:52:54,388 --> 00:52:58,683
No, they're just what I do, for myself.

887
00:52:58,893 --> 00:53:00,727
What I feel.

888
00:53:01,937 --> 00:53:04,230
You ask lots of questions, Mr. Mill.

889
00:53:04,732 --> 00:53:08,735
You're just like the police.
That's all they did, ask questions.

890
00:53:09,904 --> 00:53:11,571
They asked me a lot about you.

891
00:53:11,739 --> 00:53:13,531
- Did they?
- Mm-hm.

892
00:53:13,699 --> 00:53:17,369
How long we've known each other,
if you'd ever been to the house before.

893
00:53:17,536 --> 00:53:20,455
Well, I suppose they have to ask
those questions.

894
00:53:20,748 --> 00:53:22,415
I don't see why.

895
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:25,085
Because that's what police do.

896
00:53:25,795 --> 00:53:28,505
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

897
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:31,466
Why was it so important
to see David that night?

898
00:53:31,717 --> 00:53:33,593
What was so urgent?

899
00:53:35,721 --> 00:53:38,348
Well, he pitched me a story
a few months ago and...

900
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:40,725
- The Japan story, right?
- Yes, the Japan story.

901
00:53:40,935 --> 00:53:44,604
I liked it at the time, but it needed work,
especially the ending.

902
00:53:44,772 --> 00:53:47,273
And I was sitting in my office that day...

903
00:53:47,441 --> 00:53:50,318
...and it suddenly occurred to me
how to make the ending work.

904
00:53:50,528 --> 00:53:52,612
So, what was it?

905
00:53:52,947 --> 00:53:56,449
- What?
- Your idea for the ending?

906
00:53:57,284 --> 00:53:58,785
Up.

907
00:53:59,495 --> 00:54:00,995
- "Up"?
- Up.

908
00:54:01,247 --> 00:54:04,165
- What does that mean?
- As opposed to down. Moods.

909
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:07,627
You know, happy as opposed to sad,
hopeful as opposed to depressing.

910
00:54:08,546 --> 00:54:11,464
- What did you think of his ending?
- I never read it.

911
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,969
- You never read it?
- Nope.

912
00:54:16,178 --> 00:54:18,179
I don't like reading.

913
00:54:18,472 --> 00:54:21,558
- Do you like books?
- I like words...

914
00:54:21,809 --> 00:54:23,476
...and letters...

915
00:54:23,686 --> 00:54:26,062
...but I'm not crazy
about complete sentences.

916
00:54:26,689 --> 00:54:27,814
Hmm.

917
00:54:27,982 --> 00:54:29,691
So, what did he think?

918
00:54:30,651 --> 00:54:34,195
He walked out on me, actually.
I don't think David liked me very much.

919
00:54:34,697 --> 00:54:38,908
I think he just didn't like happy endings.

920
00:54:42,204 --> 00:54:44,164
Put your face here.

921
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:47,333
Great.

922
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:51,713
What are you doing?
You're not gonna paint me, are you?

923
00:54:51,881 --> 00:54:55,049
I might put you in one of my paintings.

924
00:54:55,342 --> 00:54:58,678
There's one that I want to do
of an Icelandic hero.

925
00:54:58,888 --> 00:55:01,931
He's a thief and he's made of fire.

926
00:55:02,183 --> 00:55:04,517
- Hmm, but you might not like that.
- Why not?

927
00:55:05,311 --> 00:55:08,271
Because you're in the movies...

928
00:55:08,439 --> 00:55:11,357
...and in the movies, you can't
have thieves as heroes, can you?

929
00:55:11,901 --> 00:55:15,487
I don't know about that. We have
a long tradition of gangsters in the movies.

930
00:55:15,654 --> 00:55:18,865
Oh, yes, but they always have to
suffer for their crimes, don't they?

931
00:55:20,367 --> 00:55:22,535
We should pay for our crimes,
shouldn't we?

932
00:55:22,745 --> 00:55:27,332
I don't know. Knowing that you've
committed a crime is suffering enough.

933
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:32,378
If you don't suffer,
maybe it wasn't a crime after all.

934
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,381
Anyway, what difference does it make?

935
00:55:35,591 --> 00:55:38,718
It has nothing to do
with how things really are.

936
00:55:43,057 --> 00:55:44,599
You don't really believe that, do you?

937
00:55:45,976 --> 00:55:48,895
I don't know what I believe, Mr. Mill.

938
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:52,065
That is just what I feel.

939
00:55:53,776 --> 00:55:57,403
You know what you are,
June whatever-your-name-is?

940
00:55:57,905 --> 00:55:59,364
You're a pragmatic anarchist.

941
00:56:00,616 --> 00:56:02,659
- Is that what I am?
- That's what you are.

942
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:04,911
I never was sure.

943
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:13,002
Could I just pick this up? Yeah?

944
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:15,797
- Ooh, it's heavy.
- Thirty-seven ounces.

945
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:18,174
Really? Oh, look, look.

946
00:56:18,425 --> 00:56:20,760
I wanna thank my mother,
and her mother...

947
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:23,263
...and her father's mother,
who was the...

948
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,141
- Hello.
- Hello. Ha, ha.

949
00:56:27,434 --> 00:56:28,893
Meet Detective Susan Avery.

950
00:56:29,103 --> 00:56:30,144
- How do you do?
- Hello.

951
00:56:30,396 --> 00:56:31,771
- My partner.
- Willa Broom.

952
00:56:31,981 --> 00:56:33,940
My pleasure. Let's go in here.

953
00:56:34,108 --> 00:56:37,026
This is the first real movie studio
Detective Avery's been to.

954
00:56:37,194 --> 00:56:39,946
- Oh, really?
- Well, aside from the Universal tour.

955
00:56:40,155 --> 00:56:42,699
When my family comes in,
I always take them out there.

956
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:46,286
Been out there so often,
I kind of feel like I'm ready to direct.

957
00:56:46,453 --> 00:56:48,621
You'll probably do better
than the film grads...

958
00:56:48,831 --> 00:56:50,957
...they're handing the cameras
out to nowadays.

959
00:56:51,125 --> 00:56:53,793
I'm sorry I didn't call you
when I heard Kahane was dead.

960
00:56:53,961 --> 00:56:55,336
- Heard or read?
- Read.

961
00:56:55,546 --> 00:56:56,963
Why didn't you?

962
00:56:57,131 --> 00:57:00,508
Walter asked me the same question.
I wish I had a better answer for it...

963
00:57:00,718 --> 00:57:03,303
...but all I can say
is that I didn't think about it.

964
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:04,929
Hmm.

965
00:57:05,723 --> 00:57:09,309
- How did you know where he would be?
- His wife told me...

966
00:57:09,476 --> 00:57:11,895
...he was seeing The Bicycle Thief.
- Girlfriend.

967
00:57:12,313 --> 00:57:13,646
Girlfriend.

968
00:57:13,856 --> 00:57:15,773
Girlfriend. I didn't know either of them.

969
00:57:15,941 --> 00:57:18,443
I was feeling restless.
I thought I'd go see the movie.

970
00:57:18,611 --> 00:57:21,821
If he was there, I was gonna
talk to him about a job he was good for.

971
00:57:21,989 --> 00:57:24,115
So you got to the theater,
you saw him and...?

972
00:57:24,325 --> 00:57:27,243
We went and had a drink
at a Japanese place he knew about.

973
00:57:27,411 --> 00:57:30,538
It was a wild, incredible scene.
It was like Tokyo.

974
00:57:30,748 --> 00:57:33,666
But he left before you did.
Why didn't you leave together?

975
00:57:33,876 --> 00:57:36,461
It was an incredible scene.
I was having a great time.

976
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:38,338
Then why didn't you stay longer?

977
00:57:38,547 --> 00:57:42,675
Well, the people stopped singing and
then it was just a bar, and I don't drink.

978
00:57:42,843 --> 00:57:45,678
- You drank with him.
- Well, when in Rome...

979
00:57:46,347 --> 00:57:48,222
- Did you know him socially?
- No.

980
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:49,682
- Been to his house?
- No.

981
00:57:49,892 --> 00:57:52,560
- Know anything about him personally?
- No.

982
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:56,606
Griffin. Guess we're gonna
let you get back to work now.

983
00:57:59,234 --> 00:58:02,862
- Something's bothering you. What is it?
- Well, I...

984
00:58:03,072 --> 00:58:08,034
I just have to ask you, did you see him
in the parking lot after you left?

985
00:58:08,243 --> 00:58:10,036
No. I parked on the street.

986
00:58:10,204 --> 00:58:13,373
I drive a Range Rover
so I always feel safer when it's visible.

987
00:58:13,582 --> 00:58:15,792
Out on the street,
who's gonna smash a window?

988
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,001
Hmm.

989
00:58:17,169 --> 00:58:20,505
If you had a shitty car, you would
have been parked in the parking lot?

990
00:58:20,714 --> 00:58:23,466
If I had a shitty car,
I might be a dead man.

991
00:58:24,134 --> 00:58:26,636
Somehow, I think
you're a little too lucky for that.

992
00:58:26,887 --> 00:58:28,513
Thank you.

993
00:58:28,722 --> 00:58:29,973
- Okay.
- Come on.

994
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,558
- Sixty-three, Take 3, mark.
- Wait one second.

995
00:58:32,726 --> 00:58:34,060
Now.

996
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:36,562
Action.

997
00:58:38,107 --> 00:58:40,566
No, goddamn it, Peterson,
you listen to me.

998
00:58:40,776 --> 00:58:43,903
I been around a while. I got a nose.
This situation stinks.

999
00:58:44,113 --> 00:58:46,155
It stinks of The Company.

1000
00:58:46,407 --> 00:58:48,241
That's right, Peterson, the fucking CIA.

1001
00:58:48,409 --> 00:58:50,243
- You ever heard of it?
- Lily understands.

1002
00:58:50,411 --> 00:58:52,537
It's the kind of operation
those whiz-kid fucks...

1003
00:58:52,746 --> 00:58:54,580
You don't understand
what he's going for.

1004
00:58:54,748 --> 00:58:56,416
- I guess I don't.
- I find it hard...

1005
00:58:56,583 --> 00:58:58,668
...to listen to you
when you don't understand.

1006
00:58:58,919 --> 00:59:01,462
- Would you shut up, please? Could you?
- Oh, kiss my ass.

1007
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:03,089
You can't even see anything.

1008
00:59:03,257 --> 00:59:05,591
I have to cut because
my robe caught on the drawer.

1009
00:59:05,801 --> 00:59:08,052
- Oh, for chrissakes.
- I couldn't help it.

1010
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:10,471
- I like this guy. He's great.
- Scotty Glenn?

1011
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:13,516
- What kind of water is that?
- A cowboy, an FBI, priest, lover.

1012
00:59:13,684 --> 00:59:14,934
Can I have some Volvic, please?

1013
00:59:15,144 --> 00:59:18,271
- Action.
- No, goddamn...

1014
00:59:18,439 --> 00:59:21,482
I heard the police
came to see you about this dead writer.

1015
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:23,151
Who was this guy?

1016
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,278
His name was David Kahane.

1017
00:59:25,487 --> 00:59:28,281
I never heard of him.
Did we ever hire him for anything?

1018
00:59:28,449 --> 00:59:30,742
I was thinking about it.

1019
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:34,120
He pitched me a story.
I went out to talk to him about it.

1020
00:59:34,288 --> 00:59:36,247
- I don't have to endure your mouth.
- Jesus.

1021
00:59:36,498 --> 00:59:40,710
Poor bastard. His ship is about to come in,
some black kid wants his money for crack.

1022
00:59:40,878 --> 00:59:43,004
I'm sorry.
I don't wanna criticize you, babe...

1023
00:59:43,172 --> 00:59:45,465
...but I'm supposed to
be having a conversation.

1024
00:59:45,674 --> 00:59:48,634
- Are you talking to me?
- Are the cops still bothering you?

1025
00:59:48,844 --> 00:59:51,387
- Action.
- No. No, I don't think so.

1026
00:59:51,638 --> 00:59:55,141
Let Stuckel handle it. He'll
give them a couple passes to a screening...

1027
00:59:55,309 --> 00:59:59,020
...where they can sit two rows behind
Michelle Pfeiffer. They'll leave you alone.

1028
00:59:59,354 --> 01:00:00,855
- Griffin?
- Yes.

1029
01:00:01,023 --> 01:00:06,027
Um, a guy named Joe Gillis called
and he said he wants you to meet him...

1030
01:00:06,195 --> 01:00:09,363
...at the St. James Club
around 10:00 on the patio.

1031
01:00:09,656 --> 01:00:11,407
- Know who this is?
- Never heard of him.

1032
01:00:11,658 --> 01:00:15,161
- He said you'd know him.
- Anybody know who Joe Gillis is?

1033
01:00:15,329 --> 01:00:18,122
He's the character William Holden
played in Sunset Boulevard.

1034
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:20,249
The writer who gets killed
by the movie star.

1035
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:22,668
- Gloria Swanson.
- That is a fantastic movie.

1036
01:00:22,836 --> 01:00:25,463
All I know is we're doing this
my way. I happen to think...

1037
01:00:26,924 --> 01:00:30,843
Oh, that guy. Last week he said
he was Charles Foster Kane.

1038
01:00:31,428 --> 01:00:33,513
Week before that it was Rhett Butler.

1039
01:00:33,722 --> 01:00:36,516
Why would they think that
I'd kill my own sister's husband?

1040
01:00:36,683 --> 01:00:38,684
You wanna compare grosses, Bonnie?

1041
01:00:38,852 --> 01:00:40,978
I was in love with him.

1042
01:01:21,979 --> 01:01:23,271
Griffin?

1043
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,814
- Griffin.
- Malcolm McDowell.

1044
01:01:24,982 --> 01:01:26,732
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. Good to see you.

1045
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:30,278
Listen, the next time
you wanna badmouth me...

1046
01:01:30,487 --> 01:01:32,905
...have the courage to do it to my face.

1047
01:01:33,115 --> 01:01:35,408
You guys are all the same.

1048
01:01:45,419 --> 01:01:47,837
- You love it there?
- I love it. It's just wonderful.

1049
01:01:48,005 --> 01:01:50,464
You love your career too,
don't you? What is it, Tom?

1050
01:01:50,716 --> 01:01:54,093
A complete disaster. Look at what
happened in Heaven's Gate with Cimino.

1051
01:01:54,261 --> 01:01:56,762
- It just ended.
- We both are concerned about your ca...

1052
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:58,764
I knew an actor,
won't mention his name.

1053
01:01:58,932 --> 01:02:01,559
MacDOWELL: Where I live, I know
how people think and how they feel.

1054
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,603
- But it's Montana.
- Montana will end you.

1055
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:06,439
- It ended Cimino on Heaven's Gate.
- Excuse me.

1056
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:07,982
Griffin Mill.

1057
01:02:08,192 --> 01:02:10,526
- Hi. Andy Civella.
- Andy. How are you?

1058
01:02:10,777 --> 01:02:14,280
Hey, I've got Andie MacDowell sitting
over here. You know her? She's so hot.

1059
01:02:14,448 --> 01:02:16,616
- Come over, meet her.
- Still living in New York?

1060
01:02:16,783 --> 01:02:19,368
Well, I couldn't live here.
I'm allergic to happiness. Ha, ha.

1061
01:02:19,578 --> 01:02:21,037
- Andie, Griffin Mill.
- Hi, Andie.

1062
01:02:21,205 --> 01:02:22,663
- How are you?
- She's my namesake.

1063
01:02:22,831 --> 01:02:24,874
- How are the kids?
- She's the smart Andie...

1064
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:27,627
...and I'm the pretty one.
- He's wonderful. Thank you.

1065
01:02:27,794 --> 01:02:29,670
You geniuses know each other.
Tom Oakley.

1066
01:02:29,838 --> 01:02:32,465
- Of course we do. Hi. How are you?
- Oh, yes. Hi, Tom.

1067
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:35,551
Funny. I just ran into
Malcolm McDowell in the lobby.

1068
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:37,303
- Oh, really?
- Roddy McDowall...

1069
01:02:37,471 --> 01:02:39,639
...is related to a cousin
of my brother-in-law.

1070
01:02:39,806 --> 01:02:42,391
Well, I'm not related
to either one of them.

1071
01:02:52,736 --> 01:02:54,237
If I write it, I direct it.

1072
01:02:54,446 --> 01:02:56,822
The last three pictures you directed
were bombs.

1073
01:02:56,990 --> 01:02:58,074
- One broke even.
- Bombs!

1074
01:02:58,242 --> 01:03:00,326
- Thank you for the drink.
- Worst of the bunch.

1075
01:03:00,535 --> 01:03:02,495
- I really have to go.
- You gotta go, Andie?

1076
01:03:02,663 --> 01:03:04,830
- Come on, let's go.
- We'll walk you to the car.

1077
01:03:04,998 --> 01:03:07,541
- No, it's okay. Don't worry about it.
- Hang on. Griffin.

1078
01:03:07,709 --> 01:03:09,335
Griffin, we'd like to buy you a drink.

1079
01:03:09,503 --> 01:03:11,170
- I am sorry. I can't.
- Have a drink.

1080
01:03:11,338 --> 01:03:13,839
- I'm meeting someone. Business.
- Should've told him...

1081
01:03:14,007 --> 01:03:16,550
...about Habeas Corpus.
- Of course, but he's busy.

1082
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:19,512
- Is there anyone waiting for me?
- No one's asked.

1083
01:03:19,721 --> 01:03:23,474
Well, I'm expecting someone.
I'll, uh, be out by the pool.

1084
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:26,394
But he'll get back to us, right, Griffin?

1085
01:03:26,561 --> 01:03:28,437
- Griffin.
- Andie?

1086
01:04:02,347 --> 01:04:05,016
- Oh, sorry. Sorry, Griffin. Ha, ha.
- Jesus, Andy, it's you.

1087
01:04:05,225 --> 01:04:07,935
- Of course it's me.
- Listen, I can't ask you to join me.

1088
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:11,355
- I told you, I'm meeting somebody.
- Yeah, you're meeting me.

1089
01:04:11,523 --> 01:04:14,400
- We got some big business.
- You? You?

1090
01:04:14,568 --> 01:04:17,278
- Why not me?
- Jesus, Andy, you think this is funny?

1091
01:04:17,446 --> 01:04:20,114
- Think this is fucking funny?
- What are you talking about?

1092
01:04:20,324 --> 01:04:21,949
Wouldn't she make a great Nora?

1093
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:24,910
God, I'd love to write
another Doll's House for her.

1094
01:04:25,078 --> 01:04:27,705
Oh, did you meet Tom Oakley?

1095
01:04:27,956 --> 01:04:29,248
Yes.

1096
01:04:29,458 --> 01:04:32,084
- You mean, you didn't call me?
- No, I didn't call you.

1097
01:04:32,627 --> 01:04:35,629
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1098
01:04:36,089 --> 01:04:39,383
Listen. I really am meeting somebody.

1099
01:04:39,593 --> 01:04:41,761
There's no way I can hear a pitch
right now.

1100
01:04:41,928 --> 01:04:44,388
- You'll have to call me tomorrow.
- No, I can't do it tomorrow.

1101
01:04:45,766 --> 01:04:47,016
I've got a meeting at Paramount.

1102
01:04:47,184 --> 01:04:49,477
- I've got a meeting at Universal.
- Congratulations.

1103
01:04:49,644 --> 01:04:51,520
If you don't hear it now,
you'll lose it.

1104
01:04:51,688 --> 01:04:53,689
- Then I lose it, all right?
- It'll take 20 seconds.

1105
01:04:53,857 --> 01:04:56,192
- When your friend gets here...
- What friend? Who?

1106
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,818
Whoever you're gonna meet here.

1107
01:05:00,572 --> 01:05:02,198
Twenty-five words or less.

1108
01:05:02,407 --> 01:05:06,035
Absolutely. Tom, you...
No, you sit here, Tom. Go.

1109
01:05:06,953 --> 01:05:08,954
District attorney's
at a moral crossroads...

1110
01:05:09,122 --> 01:05:11,624
- Tom. Jesus Christ!
- Okay. Okay, okay. Uh...

1111
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,835
We open outside the largest
penitentiary in California.

1112
01:05:15,045 --> 01:05:18,422
It's night, it's raining.
A limousine comes in through the gate...

1113
01:05:18,632 --> 01:05:21,801
...past a tight knot of demonstrators
holding a candlelight vigil.

1114
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:25,805
The candles under the umbrellas
make them glow like Japanese lanterns.

1115
01:05:26,473 --> 01:05:28,808
That's nice. I haven't seen that before.
Good.

1116
01:05:28,975 --> 01:05:32,561
A lone demonstrator, a black woman,
steps in front of the limousine.

1117
01:05:32,771 --> 01:05:35,022
The lights illuminate her like a spirit.

1118
01:05:35,232 --> 01:05:39,443
Her eyes fix upon
those of the sole passenger.

1119
01:05:40,904 --> 01:05:42,822
The moment is devastating
between them.

1120
01:05:43,031 --> 01:05:46,158
He's the DA, she's the mother
of the person that's being executed.

1121
01:05:46,326 --> 01:05:48,786
You're good. See, I told you. He's good.

1122
01:05:48,995 --> 01:05:50,246
- Go on.
- Okay.

1123
01:05:50,455 --> 01:05:52,832
The DA believes in the death penalty.

1124
01:05:53,041 --> 01:05:57,503
And the execution is a hard case.
Black, 19 and definitely guilty.

1125
01:05:57,671 --> 01:05:59,505
We're in the greatest democracy
in the world...

1126
01:05:59,714 --> 01:06:02,341
...and 36 percent of the people
on death row are black.

1127
01:06:02,551 --> 01:06:04,385
- Poor, disadvantaged black.
- More. More.

1128
01:06:04,594 --> 01:06:07,263
And he swears that
the next person he sees to die...

1129
01:06:07,472 --> 01:06:09,849
...is gonna be smart, rich and white.

1130
01:06:10,016 --> 01:06:12,518
- You, me, whoever.
- What a hook, huh?

1131
01:06:12,727 --> 01:06:15,855
- Beauty hook. Cut to the chase, Tom.
- Okay. Okay, okay.

1132
01:06:16,022 --> 01:06:20,359
Cut from the DA to
an upmarket suburban neighborhood.

1133
01:06:20,569 --> 01:06:21,986
A couple have a fight.

1134
01:06:22,195 --> 01:06:25,906
He leaves in a fit, gets in a car.
It's the same rainy night.

1135
01:06:26,116 --> 01:06:28,784
The car spins out on a road,
goes into a ravine.

1136
01:06:29,286 --> 01:06:30,870
The body is swept away.

1137
01:06:31,037 --> 01:06:33,581
Now, when the police examine the car...

1138
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:36,125
...they find the brakes
have been tampered with.

1139
01:06:36,334 --> 01:06:39,587
It's murder and the DA
decides to go for the big one.

1140
01:06:40,088 --> 01:06:42,214
He's gonna put the wife
in the gas chamber.

1141
01:06:42,424 --> 01:06:44,258
But the DA falls in love with the wife.

1142
01:06:44,426 --> 01:06:47,720
Of course he falls in love, but he
puts her in the gas chamber anyway.

1143
01:06:47,929 --> 01:06:50,639
Then he finds out the husband is alive...

1144
01:06:50,849 --> 01:06:53,058
...that he faked his death.

1145
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:56,854
The DA breaks into the prison,
runs down death row...

1146
01:06:57,063 --> 01:06:58,772
...but he gets there too late.

1147
01:06:58,982 --> 01:07:01,317
The gas pellets have been dropped.

1148
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:03,319
She's dead.

1149
01:07:03,778 --> 01:07:05,446
I'll tell you...

1150
01:07:05,822 --> 01:07:07,907
...there's not a dry eye in the house.

1151
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:10,701
- She's dead?
- She's dead.

1152
01:07:10,911 --> 01:07:14,413
She's dead.
Because that's the reality.

1153
01:07:14,623 --> 01:07:17,082
The innocent die.

1154
01:07:18,126 --> 01:07:20,753
- Who's the DA?
- Ah. No one.

1155
01:07:20,962 --> 01:07:23,214
- No one?
- "No stars on this project."

1156
01:07:23,381 --> 01:07:27,801
- We're going out on a limb on this one.
- You know, like unknown stage actors...

1157
01:07:27,969 --> 01:07:29,929
...or maybe somebody English
like what's-his-name.

1158
01:07:30,096 --> 01:07:31,388
Mm-hm.

1159
01:07:32,724 --> 01:07:34,642
- Why?
- Why? Why?

1160
01:07:34,851 --> 01:07:37,645
Because this story
is just too damned important...

1161
01:07:37,812 --> 01:07:39,813
...to risk being overwhelmed
by personality.

1162
01:07:40,023 --> 01:07:42,733
Yeah, that's fine for action pictures,
but this is special.

1163
01:07:42,901 --> 01:07:44,568
We want real people here.

1164
01:07:44,778 --> 01:07:47,613
We don't want people coming in
with any preconceived notions.

1165
01:07:47,822 --> 01:07:51,367
- We want them to see a district attorney.
- Bruce Willis.

1166
01:07:51,576 --> 01:07:54,245
No. Not Bruce Willis, not Kevin Costner.

1167
01:07:54,454 --> 01:07:57,289
This is an innocent woman
fighting for her life.

1168
01:07:57,457 --> 01:07:59,166
- Julia Roberts.
- If we can get her.

1169
01:07:59,376 --> 01:08:01,877
- Of course we can get her.
- If I'm perfectly honest...

1170
01:08:02,045 --> 01:08:05,339
...if I think about this,
this isn't even an American film.

1171
01:08:07,592 --> 01:08:10,844
- It's not?
- No, no. There are no stars.

1172
01:08:11,054 --> 01:08:12,596
No pat happy endings.

1173
01:08:12,764 --> 01:08:16,559
No Schwarzenegger, no stickups,
no terrorists.

1174
01:08:16,768 --> 01:08:20,479
This is a tough story. A tragedy
in which an innocent woman dies.

1175
01:08:20,647 --> 01:08:24,525
Why? Because that happens.

1176
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:28,821
Habeas Corpus.

1177
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:31,865
That's what we're calling it.
"Produce the corpse."

1178
01:08:32,075 --> 01:08:33,576
What do you say? Yes or no?

1179
01:08:34,744 --> 01:08:36,495
That pitch was more than 25 words.

1180
01:08:36,705 --> 01:08:39,582
Yeah, but it's brilliant.
What's the verdict, Griffin?

1181
01:08:39,791 --> 01:08:41,792
Mr. Mill, for you.

1182
01:08:42,419 --> 01:08:45,212
- Who gave this to you?
- I received it at the front desk.

1183
01:08:45,422 --> 01:08:47,047
What is it?

1184
01:08:50,302 --> 01:08:51,802
It's, um...

1185
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:55,139
It's from the person I was meeting.
He's not coming.

1186
01:08:55,307 --> 01:08:57,558
Well, do we have a shot? Griffin.

1187
01:08:57,767 --> 01:09:00,269
It's an intriguing idea.
Give me a call at the studio.

1188
01:09:00,437 --> 01:09:01,770
- Yeah!
- There's a scene...

1189
01:09:01,938 --> 01:09:04,023
...in Throne of Blood
that has exactly the texture.

1190
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:06,692
- Tom. Just say "thank you."
- If you wanna... Okay.

1191
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:08,277
She has to die. No Hollywood ending.

1192
01:09:08,445 --> 01:09:10,237
- Tom, "thank you," say.
- God!

1193
01:11:05,645 --> 01:11:08,605
Fuck you! You fucking dog-shit writer!

1194
01:11:08,815 --> 01:11:10,232
You fucking try to kill me!

1195
01:11:11,568 --> 01:11:12,609
Fuck.

1196
01:11:34,007 --> 01:11:37,301
Oh, God. You gave me such a scare.

1197
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:39,344
What are you doing here?

1198
01:11:40,722 --> 01:11:43,932
You gave me such a fright. Come in.

1199
01:11:44,434 --> 01:11:46,018
Come on in.

1200
01:11:47,729 --> 01:11:51,565
What's the matter? You look terrible.

1201
01:11:51,983 --> 01:11:53,275
What's up?

1202
01:11:55,904 --> 01:11:58,030
Sit down. I'll get you a drink.

1203
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:11,168
Something happened?

1204
01:12:12,504 --> 01:12:13,837
Is it too late? I...

1205
01:12:14,047 --> 01:12:15,047
- No, no, no.
- Sorry.

1206
01:12:15,215 --> 01:12:16,757
It's not too late. No.

1207
01:12:16,966 --> 01:12:20,719
- I don't even know what time it is.
- What's wrong?

1208
01:12:26,226 --> 01:12:28,060
What are you painting? Is that me?

1209
01:12:28,228 --> 01:12:31,146
Yep. It's you.

1210
01:12:32,816 --> 01:12:34,149
See?

1211
01:12:34,359 --> 01:12:36,610
Do you have snakes in Iceland?

1212
01:12:36,778 --> 01:12:38,570
Snakes? No, I don't think so, no.

1213
01:12:38,822 --> 01:12:40,447
Are you afraid of snakes?

1214
01:12:40,615 --> 01:12:43,450
I don't know.
I've never come close to a real one.

1215
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:45,828
They scare the shit out of me.

1216
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:55,546
- Here, have another.
- I don't usually drink.

1217
01:12:59,342 --> 01:13:01,885
Something happened tonight.

1218
01:13:02,470 --> 01:13:04,638
Yes, but, uh...

1219
01:13:06,558 --> 01:13:09,226
...there's something else
I have to tell you.

1220
01:13:11,729 --> 01:13:13,897
This isn't easy for me.

1221
01:13:15,275 --> 01:13:16,358
Yes?

1222
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,868
How about if I just
get on with my work...

1223
01:13:26,494 --> 01:13:30,414
...and you talk to me
when you feel like, okay?

1224
01:13:37,088 --> 01:13:39,756
I came very close to dying tonight.

1225
01:13:43,469 --> 01:13:45,095
All I could think about was you.

1226
01:13:46,723 --> 01:13:48,932
I don't even know you.

1227
01:13:49,642 --> 01:13:52,019
But you came into my mind...

1228
01:13:54,355 --> 01:13:58,650
...and I couldn't...
I couldn't think of anything else.

1229
01:14:01,738 --> 01:14:04,489
Remember that first night
we spoke on the phone?

1230
01:14:06,826 --> 01:14:09,036
I was outside these windows...

1231
01:14:10,330 --> 01:14:12,623
...watching you and, um...

1232
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:18,170
It was so exciting and so...

1233
01:14:19,672 --> 01:14:21,757
...new and...

1234
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,844
...strange.

1235
01:14:28,765 --> 01:14:31,516
I can't get you out of my mind.

1236
01:14:34,604 --> 01:14:37,272
Are you making love to me?

1237
01:14:39,817 --> 01:14:42,194
Yes, I guess I am.

1238
01:14:43,696 --> 01:14:45,572
I guess I am.

1239
01:14:49,035 --> 01:14:58,043
I wanna make love to you.

1240
01:14:59,087 --> 01:15:01,046
It's too soon.

1241
01:15:04,342 --> 01:15:06,593
It's too soon, isn't it?

1242
01:15:08,554 --> 01:15:11,139
It's so strange how things happen.

1243
01:15:13,142 --> 01:15:15,227
David was here...

1244
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,479
...then he left.

1245
01:15:18,606 --> 01:15:20,607
You arrived.

1246
01:15:22,986 --> 01:15:25,779
Maybe it's just the timing,
but I feel like...

1247
01:15:25,947 --> 01:15:29,533
...I would go anywhere with you...

1248
01:15:30,827 --> 01:15:32,744
...if you asked.

1249
01:15:36,499 --> 01:15:38,750
But we mustn't hurry things.

1250
01:15:38,918 --> 01:15:44,881
You know, we can't hurry things
any more than we can stop them.

1251
01:15:47,093 --> 01:15:49,386
I think you better go now.

1252
01:15:49,721 --> 01:15:52,139
I think I'm going to cry now.

1253
01:15:56,602 --> 01:15:59,146
Better go, quick.

1254
01:16:05,361 --> 01:16:06,737
I'm sorry.

1255
01:16:06,946 --> 01:16:10,282
No, no, no, don't be sorry.
Just go home...

1256
01:16:10,908 --> 01:16:13,035
...and get some sleep...

1257
01:16:13,745 --> 01:16:15,370
...and call me.

1258
01:16:16,289 --> 01:16:17,956
Tomorrow.

1259
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:21,710
Invite me on a proper date.

1260
01:16:22,795 --> 01:16:24,671
I'd like that.

1261
01:16:39,687 --> 01:16:41,188
Jan?

1262
01:16:41,481 --> 01:16:42,481
- Jan!
- Yeah?

1263
01:16:42,648 --> 01:16:44,107
Get Larry Levy on the phone.

1264
01:16:44,275 --> 01:16:47,069
- I don't think he's on the lot.
- Try his car.

1265
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:48,945
Isn't he at Fox?

1266
01:16:49,155 --> 01:16:51,156
He used to be. Not anymore.

1267
01:16:51,324 --> 01:16:54,618
I pitched him something a few months ago
and he hated it.

1268
01:16:55,119 --> 01:16:57,245
- Yeah, Griffin.
- Yeah, yeah.

1269
01:16:57,413 --> 01:16:58,872
Listen, I've got Tom Oakley...

1270
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,833
...and Andy Civella.
I wouldn't be bothering you if I didn't...

1271
01:17:02,085 --> 01:17:04,002
...think they had an idea
you should hear.

1272
01:17:04,170 --> 01:17:06,588
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Larry.

1273
01:17:06,798 --> 01:17:09,591
Uh, the next voice you're gonna hear
has got an English accent.

1274
01:17:09,801 --> 01:17:11,635
Tom Oakley. I'm Andy Civella.

1275
01:17:11,844 --> 01:17:14,304
Hi, Andy. I know Tom.
How are you, Tom?

1276
01:17:14,472 --> 01:17:16,473
Uh, very well, Larry. And yourself?

1277
01:17:16,849 --> 01:17:18,642
Fine. What's your story?

1278
01:17:19,727 --> 01:17:22,437
We open outside San Quentin. It's night.

1279
01:17:24,023 --> 01:17:26,983
It's raining.
A limousine enters through the front gate...

1280
01:17:27,151 --> 01:17:31,321
...past a tight knot of demonstrators holding
a candlelight vigil. The candles are...

1281
01:17:31,531 --> 01:17:34,699
...flickering underneath the umbrellas,
glowing like Japanese lanterns.

1282
01:17:35,201 --> 01:17:38,495
A lone demonstrator, black woman,
steps in front of the limousine.

1283
01:17:38,704 --> 01:17:41,039
Her eyes connect
with the lone passenger.

1284
01:17:41,249 --> 01:17:45,710
It's a devastating moment
for both of them. Incredibly potent.

1285
01:17:47,713 --> 01:17:51,216
No stars, no Schwarzenegger,
no pat Hollywood endings...

1286
01:17:51,384 --> 01:17:54,511
...no car chases.
This is an American tragedy...

1287
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:56,680
...in which an innocent woman dies.

1288
01:17:56,889 --> 01:18:00,559
Because that happens. That's reality.

1289
01:18:01,602 --> 01:18:03,895
Take me off the speakerphone, Griffin.

1290
01:18:05,189 --> 01:18:06,314
Yeah?

1291
01:18:06,524 --> 01:18:11,027
I don't know. It's a really hot story,
but what is this bullshit, no stars?

1292
01:18:11,237 --> 01:18:15,073
Let me give you a little tip, Larry.
Levison came to power on two movies.

1293
01:18:15,241 --> 01:18:17,534
They made $300 million
and had no stars in them.

1294
01:18:17,702 --> 01:18:20,162
He's gonna love this idea.
It'll remind him of his youth.

1295
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:23,373
You know what his motto used to be?
No stars, just talent.

1296
01:18:23,583 --> 01:18:27,294
- Has anyone else heard this?
- I don't think so. No.

1297
01:18:28,045 --> 01:18:29,379
We should make a deal now.

1298
01:18:29,755 --> 01:18:32,507
Tomorrow may be too late.
Can we get ahold of Levison?

1299
01:18:32,717 --> 01:18:35,093
Yeah, I'll get Levison.
Uh, when can you be back?

1300
01:18:35,303 --> 01:18:37,804
- I'll be there right after my AA meeting.
- Oh, Larry.

1301
01:18:37,972 --> 01:18:40,348
I didn't realize you, uh,
had a drinking problem.

1302
01:18:40,516 --> 01:18:41,725
Well...

1303
01:18:41,934 --> 01:18:46,438
...I don't really, but that's where all the
deals are being made these days. See you.

1304
01:18:48,316 --> 01:18:51,568
Tom, that was a hell of a pitch.

1305
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,905
Good work. I think you sold Larry.

1306
01:18:55,114 --> 01:18:57,282
Great. When are we gonna hear?

1307
01:18:57,450 --> 01:18:59,951
I want you to go home,
put some champagne on ice.

1308
01:19:00,119 --> 01:19:01,786
I'll give you an answer by tonight.

1309
01:19:01,954 --> 01:19:05,582
- Jan, come in here.
- Griffin, you move in mysterious ways...

1310
01:19:05,791 --> 01:19:08,460
...but I like it. I like it.
- Okay.

1311
01:19:08,628 --> 01:19:10,420
Did Levy understand? No stars?

1312
01:19:10,588 --> 01:19:13,048
Yes, he was particularly attracted
to that notion.

1313
01:19:13,257 --> 01:19:16,051
- No Hollywood ending?
- No Hollywood ending.

1314
01:19:18,554 --> 01:19:20,472
They looked happy.

1315
01:19:20,932 --> 01:19:23,725
They have a completely fucked-up idea
that has no second act.

1316
01:19:23,893 --> 01:19:26,645
If I hadn't heard it myself,
I never would have believed it.

1317
01:19:26,812 --> 01:19:29,981
Larry Levy liked it
because he's a dick-brain.

1318
01:19:30,149 --> 01:19:32,317
Levy will sell the idea to Levison...

1319
01:19:32,485 --> 01:19:35,070
...and then I will let Levison
have the brilliant idea...

1320
01:19:35,238 --> 01:19:38,406
...of letting Larry
take over the project for me.

1321
01:19:38,574 --> 01:19:39,783
You will?

1322
01:19:39,992 --> 01:19:42,744
See, Levison can't wait
to get in bed with Levy.

1323
01:19:43,329 --> 01:19:47,082
This piece-of-shit idea
will blow up in both their faces.

1324
01:19:47,291 --> 01:19:51,503
And then I will step in and save the day.

1325
01:19:53,673 --> 01:19:55,590
- Score!
- Yes!

1326
01:19:56,467 --> 01:19:58,343
Three points.

1327
01:19:58,803 --> 01:20:00,553
Great shot.

1328
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,309
She's receiving the last rites.

1329
01:20:06,477 --> 01:20:09,062
The DA discovers that
the husband faked his own death.

1330
01:20:09,230 --> 01:20:12,524
She's innocent. He races to
the penitentiary, but it's too late.

1331
01:20:12,692 --> 01:20:15,026
The pellets have dropped. She's dead.

1332
01:20:15,278 --> 01:20:17,779
He helped kill the woman he loved.

1333
01:20:17,989 --> 01:20:21,283
- Who are the stars?
- No stars, just talent.

1334
01:20:21,659 --> 01:20:23,326
No stars?

1335
01:20:23,536 --> 01:20:27,205
What kind of ending do you call that?
It's depressing. It'll bring everybody down.

1336
01:20:27,373 --> 01:20:29,624
Depressing? Joel, what about
Terms of Endearment?

1337
01:20:29,834 --> 01:20:31,334
Love Story? Steel Magnolias?

1338
01:20:31,544 --> 01:20:33,003
E.T. Grossed what? What, Marty?

1339
01:20:33,170 --> 01:20:36,548
Three hundred nineteen million dollars.
There wasn't a dry eye in the house.

1340
01:20:36,716 --> 01:20:39,050
- Depressing? I don't think so.
- Yeah, but...

1341
01:20:39,218 --> 01:20:41,928
Normally I'd agree,
but this is an entirely different deal.

1342
01:20:42,096 --> 01:20:44,139
It is a matter of taking a risk.

1343
01:20:44,348 --> 01:20:45,849
Rolling the dice.

1344
01:20:46,058 --> 01:20:48,977
But if they come up seven, bingo.

1345
01:20:50,062 --> 01:20:51,313
It's Oscar time.

1346
01:20:52,565 --> 01:20:54,774
- Do they screw?
- Who?

1347
01:20:54,942 --> 01:20:57,360
The DA, whoever it is, and the woman.
Do they screw?

1348
01:20:57,528 --> 01:21:01,698
If I'm looking at jail cells and gas chambers,
we're gonna have sex in this picture.

1349
01:21:01,866 --> 01:21:04,075
Sure, of course.
We'll get it there. No problem.

1350
01:21:04,243 --> 01:21:07,746
Okay. Who's gonna shepherd
this thing?

1351
01:21:09,582 --> 01:21:12,375
Larry, you have a good feel for this.
You wanna run with it?

1352
01:21:12,585 --> 01:21:14,544
Wait. This project originated
with Griffin.

1353
01:21:14,712 --> 01:21:16,755
- Bonnie.
- Oh, no. I don't wanna dance...

1354
01:21:16,922 --> 01:21:20,675
...in somebody else's wedding.
If it's Griffin's project, it's Griffin's project.

1355
01:21:20,843 --> 01:21:24,095
- I just think we should write...
- Bonnie, this'll have to be my call.

1356
01:21:26,098 --> 01:21:27,891
It's fine with me.

1357
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:31,728
My plate is full anyway.
Larry, it's yours.

1358
01:21:32,271 --> 01:21:34,898
Hit a home run.
Win an Oscar for the home team.

1359
01:21:37,276 --> 01:21:39,110
- I've got something else for you.
- Yeah?

1360
01:21:39,278 --> 01:21:40,570
- New York tomorrow.
- Yeah?

1361
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:43,114
Tom Wolfe's book will be
at the Sherry-Netherlands.

1362
01:21:43,282 --> 01:21:44,991
- Read it, make your bid.
- Send Bonnie.

1363
01:21:45,159 --> 01:21:47,619
She'll know if it's a movie.
If it is, bid a million.

1364
01:21:47,787 --> 01:21:50,622
- Me?
- A million? Oh, that's kind of high, isn't it?

1365
01:21:51,957 --> 01:21:53,708
- It's Tom Wolfe. Why not you?
- Yeah?

1366
01:21:53,876 --> 01:21:55,835
I'm a story editor.
That's a vice president's job.

1367
01:21:56,003 --> 01:21:59,089
- You don't wanna be vice president?
- Bonnie. Pack your bags.

1368
01:21:59,590 --> 01:22:01,216
- Congratulations.
- Yeah?

1369
01:22:01,425 --> 01:22:03,843
That was the most amazing pitch
I've ever heard.

1370
01:22:04,011 --> 01:22:06,763
- If you don't want the responsibility, fine.
- No, I'm going.

1371
01:22:06,972 --> 01:22:08,681
I really wanna be one of your soldiers.

1372
01:22:08,849 --> 01:22:10,809
I'm glad you're on the team,
believe me.

1373
01:22:10,976 --> 01:22:13,895
- Thank you for the support.
- Bonnie's gonna be gone. I'm here.

1374
01:22:14,814 --> 01:22:16,648
Whitney, now.

1375
01:22:17,942 --> 01:22:19,401
Frank, Marty. You wanna come in?

1376
01:22:20,945 --> 01:22:22,654
- May I have a word?
- I have a meeting.

1377
01:22:22,905 --> 01:22:25,323
- Find the time. What is going on?
- What do you mean?

1378
01:22:25,574 --> 01:22:28,243
I mean, handing Larry Levy
your project like that.

1379
01:22:28,452 --> 01:22:30,912
Well, I just thought Larry had...

1380
01:22:31,122 --> 01:22:33,665
...a firm grasp on...

1381
01:22:33,833 --> 01:22:36,167
...the style of the piece.
- The only thing Levy...

1382
01:22:36,335 --> 01:22:38,461
...has a firm grasp on is his dick.
You know it.

1383
01:22:38,629 --> 01:22:40,338
I'm not Oz. I can't do everything.

1384
01:22:40,506 --> 01:22:43,591
If Larry has what it takes to
get a picture made, why not use him?

1385
01:22:43,759 --> 01:22:45,635
- Everybody wins.
- Why bullshit me?

1386
01:22:45,803 --> 01:22:49,139
- I'm not bullshitting you.
- Yes, you are. Griffin, I know you.

1387
01:22:49,306 --> 01:22:51,558
I know you.
You've been stringing me along...

1388
01:22:51,767 --> 01:22:53,852
- Habeas Corpus, Griffin.
- Habeas Corpus.

1389
01:22:54,061 --> 01:22:56,104
Habeas Corpus.

1390
01:22:56,689 --> 01:22:59,274
You've been stringing me along
like one of your writers.

1391
01:22:59,442 --> 01:23:01,985
What is this, getting Levison to send me?
What is that?

1392
01:23:02,153 --> 01:23:04,571
- Are you trying to get rid of me?
- Get rid of you?

1393
01:23:04,738 --> 01:23:06,739
I'm trying to help you.
If you score in New York...

1394
01:23:06,907 --> 01:23:09,242
...Levison has to make you
a vice president.

1395
01:23:09,410 --> 01:23:12,495
Jesus, Bonnie, what's the matter?
Are you afraid of success?

1396
01:23:12,705 --> 01:23:16,332
- Are you seeing someone else?
- Oh. That's what this is about?

1397
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:17,750
- It's not just this.
- Jesus.

1398
01:23:17,918 --> 01:23:20,211
It's a lot of things.
The way you've been acting.

1399
01:23:20,379 --> 01:23:22,505
Something is going on.
I wanna know what it is.

1400
01:23:22,673 --> 01:23:24,132
- Jesus Christ.
- You're not even...

1401
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:26,551
You're not even looking at me
when you're talking.

1402
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:30,221
I want you to look at me. Please look
me right in the eyes and just tell me.

1403
01:23:30,473 --> 01:23:34,142
No bullshit. Is there someone else?

1404
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:35,894
No.

1405
01:23:38,147 --> 01:23:40,023
Have a good trip.

1406
01:23:46,530 --> 01:23:50,200
Our top story this evening
involves Hollywood's three favorite G's.

1407
01:23:50,409 --> 01:23:53,244
A glamorous, glitzy,
gala night on the town.

1408
01:23:53,496 --> 01:23:57,874
It is a who's who of stars,
no IDs necessary. Household names...

1409
01:23:58,083 --> 01:24:00,418
...one and all.
Leeza Gibbons reporting here.

1410
01:24:00,669 --> 01:24:04,380
And right this minute, you could fire
a cannon down Sunset Boulevard...

1411
01:24:04,590 --> 01:24:06,758
...and not come close
to hitting a celebrity.

1412
01:24:06,926 --> 01:24:09,469
Everybody who is anybody is right here...

1413
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:12,889
...rubbing elbows and making big talk
in this ballroom.

1414
01:24:13,098 --> 01:24:14,599
All the movers, all the shakers.

1415
01:24:14,767 --> 01:24:16,726
Behind the scenes and on the screens.

1416
01:24:17,102 --> 01:24:19,896
We'll leave it to Cher
to wear fire-engine red...

1417
01:24:20,105 --> 01:24:22,315
...when the impossible-to-come-by
invitations...

1418
01:24:22,566 --> 01:24:24,651
...call for black and white only, please.

1419
01:24:24,818 --> 01:24:27,237
- Hello, nice to see you.
- Hi, Teri. Nice to see you.

1420
01:24:27,446 --> 01:24:28,613
- June Gudmundsdottir.
- Hi.

1421
01:24:28,781 --> 01:24:30,198
- Teri Garr. Buck Henry.
- Hello.

1422
01:24:30,366 --> 01:24:31,783
The occasion this evening...

1423
01:24:31,951 --> 01:24:34,285
...just as big and important
as the all-star turnout.

1424
01:24:34,495 --> 01:24:38,414
The studio world-famous for the slogan
"Movies, now more than ever"...

1425
01:24:38,624 --> 01:24:43,002
...is donating prints of 25 of its classic
black-and-white films to the museum.

1426
01:24:43,254 --> 01:24:47,298
Now, they'll be able to say,
"Movies, now more than ever, forever."

1427
01:24:47,508 --> 01:24:48,800
Thank you.

1428
01:24:49,301 --> 01:24:54,639
It's wonderful to see so many
familiar and friendly faces around.

1429
01:24:54,807 --> 01:25:00,144
As you know, the L.A. County Museum
has always been close to our hearts.

1430
01:25:00,354 --> 01:25:03,064
And especially the Motion Department...

1431
01:25:03,232 --> 01:25:05,733
Uh, Motion Picture Department.

1432
01:25:06,986 --> 01:25:10,488
Uh, we're happy to make possible
this donation.

1433
01:25:11,031 --> 01:25:15,618
Now I'd like to introduce the man
whose idea this all was.

1434
01:25:15,828 --> 01:25:17,495
Griffin Mill. Please.

1435
01:25:24,336 --> 01:25:26,337
Thank you, Joel.

1436
01:25:27,131 --> 01:25:28,464
Grab another drink.

1437
01:25:33,012 --> 01:25:35,346
I'd like to extend my thanks...

1438
01:25:35,514 --> 01:25:37,849
...to the patrons of
the Los Angeles County Museum.

1439
01:25:38,684 --> 01:25:41,978
You have long fostered
the art of motion pictures...

1440
01:25:42,187 --> 01:25:46,899
...as a serious and valuable art form
in this community.

1441
01:25:47,151 --> 01:25:49,902
Many people across the country
and around the world...

1442
01:25:50,154 --> 01:25:54,073
...have for too long thought of movies
as a popular entertainment...

1443
01:25:54,325 --> 01:25:56,534
...more than a serious art.

1444
01:25:56,785 --> 01:26:00,913
And I'm afraid a large majority
of the press supports this attitude.

1445
01:26:01,165 --> 01:26:04,876
We want great films
with long shelf lives.

1446
01:26:05,044 --> 01:26:07,503
We want the films
of the new John Hustons...

1447
01:26:07,713 --> 01:26:10,548
...Orson Welles, Frank Capra.

1448
01:26:10,799 --> 01:26:15,887
We and the other major film studios
have a responsibility to the public...

1449
01:26:16,055 --> 01:26:19,932
...to maintain the art
of motion pictures...

1450
01:26:20,184 --> 01:26:22,894
...as our primary mandate.

1451
01:26:23,187 --> 01:26:26,314
Movies are art...

1452
01:26:26,523 --> 01:26:29,734
...now more than ever.

1453
01:26:30,694 --> 01:26:32,111
Thank you.

1454
01:26:39,912 --> 01:26:42,872
Griffin, a hell of a job.
I couldn't have done it better myself.

1455
01:26:43,082 --> 01:26:45,708
I'll know all of your lines soon.

1456
01:26:47,628 --> 01:26:52,048
- Well, are we having fun yet?
- I'm having a great time.

1457
01:26:56,595 --> 01:26:58,429
Yes, I do.

1458
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:00,556
I did too.

1459
01:27:06,271 --> 01:27:08,856
Is this a friend of a friend?

1460
01:27:09,024 --> 01:27:10,817
- I'm sorry.
- How did you meet?

1461
01:27:10,984 --> 01:27:14,070
How did we meet?
Well, at a funeral. Yes.

1462
01:27:14,279 --> 01:27:16,989
- Isn't that right? Funeral?
- Absolutely. Excuse us.

1463
01:27:17,241 --> 01:27:20,284
Steve. Steve, whose daughter is he with?

1464
01:27:20,452 --> 01:27:21,786
Seriously, I...

1465
01:27:23,163 --> 01:27:25,707
I think she's with his cousin...

1466
01:27:25,874 --> 01:27:28,000
Said he was sure
she was somebody's daughter.

1467
01:27:28,168 --> 01:27:30,920
- I wanna know whose daughter she was.
- No. I don't know.

1468
01:27:52,526 --> 01:27:54,402
BOTH CHUCKLING]

1469
01:27:55,654 --> 01:27:58,656
- Don't make a scene.
- You're doing it all wrong. Ha, ha.

1470
01:27:59,491 --> 01:28:00,700
Here we go.

1471
01:28:00,868 --> 01:28:03,828
Oops. That was a good one.

1472
01:28:04,997 --> 01:28:08,541
Well, that's what I call a real date.

1473
01:28:13,464 --> 01:28:15,339
Should I come in?

1474
01:28:15,716 --> 01:28:17,925
Uh, well...

1475
01:28:18,093 --> 01:28:20,511
- Hmm, well...
- Not tonight.

1476
01:28:20,679 --> 01:28:22,847
- No, not tonight.
- But soon.

1477
01:28:24,183 --> 01:28:26,142
Very soon.

1478
01:28:28,479 --> 01:28:30,688
- How about Mexico?
- Mexico?

1479
01:28:30,939 --> 01:28:32,523
Neutral territory. Acapulco.

1480
01:28:32,733 --> 01:28:34,317
I've never been to Acapulco.

1481
01:28:34,526 --> 01:28:35,735
We'll go.

1482
01:28:35,903 --> 01:28:38,112
- Is that the thing to do?
- That's a thing to do.

1483
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:40,948
- Let's do it, then.
- We'll go this weekend.

1484
01:28:41,158 --> 01:28:42,700
Really?

1485
01:28:45,370 --> 01:28:48,456
- Do I need a passport?
- Yes.

1486
01:29:37,005 --> 01:29:40,258
Mr. Mill, I'm Detective DeLongpre,
Pasadena Police.

1487
01:29:40,425 --> 01:29:42,093
Yes, I recognize you.

1488
01:29:42,261 --> 01:29:44,554
Did you have a good time
at the party last night?

1489
01:29:44,721 --> 01:29:48,432
No, I didn't. I'm not supposed to
have a good time when I'm on duty.

1490
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:51,060
Great, well, what do you want,
Detective DeLongpre?

1491
01:29:51,270 --> 01:29:54,105
- I'd like you to come down to the station.
- Why?

1492
01:29:54,314 --> 01:29:56,315
- To look at some pictures.
- Pictures?

1493
01:29:56,567 --> 01:29:59,902
Mug shots.
You know, like in the movies.

1494
01:30:00,070 --> 01:30:02,989
Ah, mug shots. Yes, well, all right.

1495
01:30:03,156 --> 01:30:05,116
- Will you follow me to Pasadena?
- Pasadena.

1496
01:30:05,325 --> 01:30:06,951
- Pasadena.
- Right.

1497
01:30:07,119 --> 01:30:09,787
Will you fasten your safety belt, please?

1498
01:30:13,959 --> 01:30:15,293
- Come, let's go.
- No!

1499
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:17,461
- Take your hands off her!
- Hush.

1500
01:30:17,671 --> 01:30:19,839
- I want my baby.
- Where's her baby at?

1501
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:21,883
- Let me go!
- No.

1502
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:23,968
- Mr. Mill.
- Hello. How are you?

1503
01:30:24,136 --> 01:30:26,220
Good to see you.
Everybody, this is Mr. Mill.

1504
01:30:26,388 --> 01:30:29,974
- Good to see you again.
- He makes movies. Have a seat, Mr. Mill.

1505
01:30:30,392 --> 01:30:33,311
Where the fuck is he going?
Excuse, me, sir. Mr. Mill. Mr. Mill.

1506
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,521
Not in here.
This is my lieutenant's office.

1507
01:30:35,731 --> 01:30:38,691
- Have a seat in my seat. Right here.
- I'm sorry.

1508
01:30:39,192 --> 01:30:40,234
All right, now.

1509
01:30:40,402 --> 01:30:42,653
Uh... Willa.

1510
01:30:42,863 --> 01:30:43,905
- Could you?
- Sorry.

1511
01:30:44,156 --> 01:30:45,865
Your desk. Thank you.

1512
01:30:46,116 --> 01:30:47,491
Sorry. Have a seat, Mr. Mill.

1513
01:30:47,701 --> 01:30:50,077
Listen, um, before we start, I just...

1514
01:30:50,245 --> 01:30:53,247
Paul went to see a movie last night
he came in here raving about.

1515
01:30:53,498 --> 01:30:54,957
What was the name of that movie?

1516
01:30:55,125 --> 01:30:57,668
Changed the lady into a chicken
at the end. What did you see?

1517
01:30:57,836 --> 01:30:59,420
- Freaks.
- Freaks.

1518
01:30:59,671 --> 01:31:01,714
- Have you seen this?
- Tod Browning. Yes.

1519
01:31:01,924 --> 01:31:05,760
"One of us, one of us, one of us,
one of us."

1520
01:31:05,928 --> 01:31:08,179
He came in doing that.
He was raving about it.

1521
01:31:08,388 --> 01:31:12,516
He loved it. He loved it. It was thrilling
for me. Um, Willa. Excuse me.

1522
01:31:12,684 --> 01:31:15,519
Did you happen to see where the tampons
went that were in here?

1523
01:31:15,687 --> 01:31:18,648
- Because I can't seem to find them.
- I didn't take them.

1524
01:31:18,857 --> 01:31:20,149
Who took them? Did he?

1525
01:31:20,359 --> 01:31:22,151
- I don't know. I didn't.
- Who did?

1526
01:31:22,361 --> 01:31:25,196
- I didn't take them.
- You see this? Damn.

1527
01:31:26,531 --> 01:31:29,033
Um, so do you have a break in the case?

1528
01:31:29,242 --> 01:31:31,035
Oh, what makes you say that?

1529
01:31:31,203 --> 01:31:34,038
Well, why else
would you bring me here?

1530
01:31:35,290 --> 01:31:36,415
Why else, indeed.

1531
01:31:37,793 --> 01:31:43,214
Paul. Paul, why have you brought Mr. Mill
in here today?

1532
01:31:43,382 --> 01:31:45,883
- To look at some pictures.
- Willa.

1533
01:31:46,385 --> 01:31:47,927
Pictures?

1534
01:31:48,178 --> 01:31:52,807
Listen, could you...? If you remember,
what were you, uh, wearing that night?

1535
01:31:53,058 --> 01:31:56,894
I was wearing a double-breasted suit,
I believe.

1536
01:31:57,729 --> 01:31:59,563
Oh, it's all right. What's the matter?

1537
01:31:59,731 --> 01:32:02,233
- Mr. Mill, you're so jumpy. Sit down.
- I'll get it.

1538
01:32:02,401 --> 01:32:05,945
No, no, she... That's what she's here for.
It's all right. Have a seat.

1539
01:32:06,196 --> 01:32:07,822
- Sorry.
- No problem.

1540
01:32:08,490 --> 01:32:09,907
Okay.

1541
01:32:10,075 --> 01:32:12,076
Will you take a look at this gentle...?

1542
01:32:12,285 --> 01:32:13,786
- Where were they?
- Right here.

1543
01:32:13,996 --> 01:32:16,497
She found them, look.
You're right. Ha, ha.

1544
01:32:16,748 --> 01:32:19,458
Oh, wait a minute. No, no.
These aren't mine.

1545
01:32:19,626 --> 01:32:21,669
These are slender regular.
These are yours.

1546
01:32:21,837 --> 01:32:23,254
Yeah, I guess you have jumbo.

1547
01:32:24,589 --> 01:32:26,465
Well, I do use jumbo. These are not mine.

1548
01:32:26,842 --> 01:32:29,510
God. Just trying to help you out.

1549
01:32:29,678 --> 01:32:33,305
Um, look, did you see this guy
the night of the murder?

1550
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,019
Sorry, ha, ha. Um...

1551
01:32:38,186 --> 01:32:41,772
No. Uh, you're putting me
in a terrible position here.

1552
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:43,816
I would hate to get
the wrong person arrested.

1553
01:32:43,984 --> 01:32:47,236
Oh, please. This is Pasadena.
We do not arrest the wrong person.

1554
01:32:47,446 --> 01:32:50,573
That's L.A. See, L.A., they kick
your ass and then they arrest you.

1555
01:32:50,741 --> 01:32:53,409
That's what they do. We don't do that.
Remember last year?

1556
01:32:53,577 --> 01:32:55,953
What was that guy's name?
They put him on the tape.

1557
01:32:56,163 --> 01:32:57,455
- King.
- That's right, King.

1558
01:32:57,664 --> 01:32:59,874
- BLT.
- He was the wrong guy.

1559
01:33:03,128 --> 01:33:05,880
- Do you have a witness?
- Now, I can't answer that.

1560
01:33:06,131 --> 01:33:10,217
Well, either you have a witness
or these are suspects in similar murders.

1561
01:33:10,385 --> 01:33:12,636
Mr. Mill, have you been going
to detective school?

1562
01:33:12,846 --> 01:33:17,224
No, actually, we're doing a movie right
now called The Lonely Room. Scott Glenn...

1563
01:33:17,392 --> 01:33:19,810
...plays a detective like you.
- Is he a black woman?

1564
01:33:20,020 --> 01:33:21,353
- No.
- Don't give me turkey.

1565
01:33:21,521 --> 01:33:25,191
- Lily Tomlin's in that? I heard about that.
- Actually I was drawing a comparison...

1566
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:27,902
...not based on race or gender.

1567
01:33:28,153 --> 01:33:32,823
Speaking of which,
did you go out with, uh, June, uh...?

1568
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:34,909
What is that woman's name?

1569
01:33:36,203 --> 01:33:37,411
Gudmundsdottir.

1570
01:33:37,996 --> 01:33:41,749
Ha. What is it? Who? Spell it for me.

1571
01:33:41,917 --> 01:33:44,376
G-U-D-M-U-N-D-S-D-O-T-T-l-R.

1572
01:33:44,586 --> 01:33:46,170
Well, that really helps.

1573
01:33:46,338 --> 01:33:48,422
Could you...?
Uh, did you go out with June...?

1574
01:33:48,590 --> 01:33:50,508
- Gudmundsdottir.
- Yeah. Her. Last night?

1575
01:33:50,675 --> 01:33:51,967
Yes, I did.

1576
01:33:52,135 --> 01:33:53,969
You guys known each other
a long time?

1577
01:33:54,179 --> 01:33:57,181
No, I spoke to her for the first time
the night Kahane was killed.

1578
01:33:57,349 --> 01:33:58,557
Wow.

1579
01:33:58,725 --> 01:34:00,684
- So you didn't know her before this?
- No.

1580
01:34:00,894 --> 01:34:02,520
We met over the phone.

1581
01:34:02,687 --> 01:34:04,688
We got to talking,
one thing led to another.

1582
01:34:04,898 --> 01:34:06,690
You fuck her?

1583
01:34:07,692 --> 01:34:11,529
- What kind of question is that?
- I think it's pretty direct. Did you fuck her?

1584
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:15,157
I wouldn't answer that question
without a lawyer in the room.

1585
01:34:15,325 --> 01:34:17,701
Then I probably wouldn't
even answer that question.

1586
01:34:17,911 --> 01:34:20,329
Why don't you ask your friend?
He's been following me.

1587
01:34:20,497 --> 01:34:22,623
- He'll probably know.
- All right.

1588
01:34:22,874 --> 01:34:27,878
Paul, did Mr. Mill
fuck June Hudmuuhunta?

1589
01:34:28,088 --> 01:34:29,338
I didn't see him.

1590
01:34:29,506 --> 01:34:32,299
- Got away with it. He didn't see you.
- What are you implying?

1591
01:34:32,467 --> 01:34:35,553
I'm not implying. I asked a direct question.
Did you fuck her?

1592
01:34:35,762 --> 01:34:38,055
I told you I wouldn't answer that
without a lawyer.

1593
01:34:38,223 --> 01:34:41,058
- Why you getting hot under the collar?
- You're being rude.

1594
01:34:41,226 --> 01:34:42,393
Oh, well, excuse me.

1595
01:34:42,602 --> 01:34:46,564
But I think it's kind of soon for her
to be gallivanting in the streets with you.

1596
01:34:46,773 --> 01:34:49,024
I'm there for her as a friend, Miss Avery.

1597
01:34:49,192 --> 01:34:51,360
- Mm.
- Why don't you call her?

1598
01:34:51,570 --> 01:34:54,738
I'm sure she'll be happy to pick over
the horror of what's happened...

1599
01:34:54,906 --> 01:34:58,367
...and tell you how we became friends.

1600
01:34:58,577 --> 01:35:00,202
What is this, fucking Iran?

1601
01:35:00,370 --> 01:35:03,998
Since when does the state tell us how long,
and with whom we can share our grief?

1602
01:35:05,876 --> 01:35:08,002
Or do you hold June Gudmundsdottir...

1603
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:10,588
...to a special code of conduct
reserved for women?

1604
01:35:17,888 --> 01:35:19,930
What the fuck are you laughing at?

1605
01:35:20,098 --> 01:35:22,266
It's just, just...

1606
01:35:22,434 --> 01:35:24,435
- I'd like to talk to my lawyer.
- Oh, my God.

1607
01:35:24,603 --> 01:35:27,521
DeLONGPRE: "One of us. One of us."
- Can't even say the bitch's name!

1608
01:35:27,689 --> 01:35:31,400
DeLONGPRE:
"One of us. One of us. One of us."

1609
01:35:41,703 --> 01:35:44,121
It's time for you
to get yourself a real good lawyer.

1610
01:35:44,331 --> 01:35:47,541
I had a drink with the guy, Walter.
That's all.

1611
01:35:47,792 --> 01:35:52,922
If you went to Pasadena with the intent
to kill, you could go to the gas chamber.

1612
01:35:53,632 --> 01:35:56,300
I went to Pasadena
with the intent to hire.

1613
01:35:57,052 --> 01:35:58,177
So you say.

1614
01:35:58,345 --> 01:36:01,138
- Griffin, the Schecter brothers are here.
- Griffin. Griffin.

1615
01:36:01,306 --> 01:36:03,224
Griffin. Don't make us wait.

1616
01:36:03,475 --> 01:36:04,642
Who is this man?

1617
01:36:04,809 --> 01:36:06,644
A travel agent called. You're confirmed.

1618
01:36:06,811 --> 01:36:08,145
He grabbed the phone from me.

1619
01:36:08,355 --> 01:36:11,565
- Travel agent?
- I'm going to Puerto Vallarta.

1620
01:36:12,150 --> 01:36:14,652
- You're leaving the country?
- For the weekend.

1621
01:36:14,819 --> 01:36:15,986
It's a risk.

1622
01:36:16,321 --> 01:36:17,571
Why?

1623
01:36:17,822 --> 01:36:20,824
Because Larry Levy
could have my office in three days.

1624
01:36:21,034 --> 01:36:24,495
- That's what Walter thinks.
- You know something I don't know?

1625
01:36:26,831 --> 01:36:27,831
You're pretty smooth.

1626
01:36:28,458 --> 01:36:30,668
I sleep at night.

1627
01:36:31,753 --> 01:36:34,004
- You really should run the studio.
- Tell a friend.

1628
01:36:34,214 --> 01:36:36,840
Yeah, Walter, it's been real.

1629
01:36:37,008 --> 01:36:39,343
Griffin. We're tired of shopping
everything around.

1630
01:36:39,511 --> 01:36:42,930
We wanna go exclusive to one studio.
How much have our three pictures made?

1631
01:36:43,098 --> 01:36:45,224
- $105 million.
- I know some people do better.

1632
01:36:45,392 --> 01:36:47,017
We're consistent and under budget.

1633
01:36:47,185 --> 01:36:49,186
He's not listening. Let's go to Columbia.

1634
01:36:49,354 --> 01:36:52,356
- We already went to Columbia.
- Oh, yeah. What did they say?

1635
01:36:52,524 --> 01:36:53,607
- Bonnie.
- Hey, Bon.

1636
01:36:53,775 --> 01:36:55,693
Hey. I got the Tom Wolfe book.

1637
01:36:56,403 --> 01:36:58,028
Congratulations.

1638
01:36:58,238 --> 01:37:00,864
Bonnie, make him give us a deal.
We want a home.

1639
01:37:01,032 --> 01:37:03,033
We're tired of shopping everything around.

1640
01:37:03,201 --> 01:37:05,494
I thought that's how
you guys like to do business.

1641
01:37:05,704 --> 01:37:07,371
Well, we changed our minds.

1642
01:37:08,623 --> 01:37:09,707
I'll talk to you later.

1643
01:37:11,209 --> 01:37:13,377
Levison says you're
going out of town tomorrow.

1644
01:37:14,045 --> 01:37:15,879
For the weekend.

1645
01:37:16,548 --> 01:37:19,800
Are you going with someone
named June something?

1646
01:37:20,552 --> 01:37:22,136
Yes.

1647
01:37:22,595 --> 01:37:26,932
You took her to a party, Griffin,
with several hundred of my best friends.

1648
01:37:27,142 --> 01:37:29,059
She's recently widowed.

1649
01:37:29,227 --> 01:37:31,645
You weren't in town, so I took her.

1650
01:37:32,897 --> 01:37:35,816
And now you're taking her
to Mexico for the weekend.

1651
01:37:37,527 --> 01:37:39,653
Let's get out of here.
Mom and Dad are fighting.

1652
01:37:39,821 --> 01:37:43,741
Guys, have your lawyer give me a call.

1653
01:37:43,908 --> 01:37:45,909
- You've got a deal.
- Yes!

1654
01:37:46,119 --> 01:37:47,995
Let's get out
before he changes his mind.

1655
01:37:48,163 --> 01:37:49,830
We have witnesses.

1656
01:38:02,844 --> 01:38:04,595
Have a good trip.

1657
01:38:11,603 --> 01:38:14,188
The white zone is for immediate loading...

1658
01:38:14,356 --> 01:38:16,982
...and unloading of passengers only.

1659
01:38:17,192 --> 01:38:18,442
No parking.

1660
01:38:18,651 --> 01:38:24,114
Do not leave your car unattended
due to the current security alert.

1661
01:38:24,324 --> 01:38:28,786
All unattended cars may be towed away
immediately.

1662
01:38:28,953 --> 01:38:30,329
For your safety...

1663
01:38:30,497 --> 01:38:32,498
- Uh, did you bring your passport?
- Yeah.

1664
01:38:32,665 --> 01:38:35,292
You wanna hear something funny?
I forgot mine.

1665
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:36,543
Oh.

1666
01:38:36,711 --> 01:38:38,962
- We have to go back and get it.
- So stupid of me.

1667
01:38:39,130 --> 01:38:41,673
- We'll miss the plane.
- We'll never make another plane.

1668
01:38:41,841 --> 01:38:43,300
Damn it!

1669
01:38:43,802 --> 01:38:46,136
It's all right.
Anyway, I got a better idea.

1670
01:38:46,304 --> 01:38:48,847
- Do you like the desert?
- I've never been to the desert.

1671
01:38:49,015 --> 01:38:51,141
Never been to the desert?
I know this hideaway...

1672
01:38:51,309 --> 01:38:52,643
...in Desert Hot Springs.

1673
01:38:52,811 --> 01:38:56,480
We'll go there. It's a two-hour drive.
I know the people. We'll call ahead.

1674
01:38:56,648 --> 01:38:58,315
Are we hiding?

1675
01:38:58,525 --> 01:39:01,860
Yeah. Yeah. We're hiding.
We're hiding from everybody.

1676
01:39:03,822 --> 01:39:06,198
You'll like it there.
It'll remind you of Iceland.

1677
01:39:38,857 --> 01:39:43,026
Evening, Mr. M. You're all checked in.
Capone Villa. You know where it is.

1678
01:39:43,236 --> 01:39:45,654
- Yep. Thanks, Walter.
- You're welcome.

1679
01:40:12,682 --> 01:40:15,392
Hey, look.
The water looks like it's steaming.

1680
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:17,936
Comes out of the ground that way.

1681
01:40:39,918 --> 01:40:42,294
There aren't many people around.

1682
01:40:42,921 --> 01:40:44,963
Well, they're fully booked, actually.

1683
01:40:45,215 --> 01:40:47,257
There's 50 rooms, 100 people.

1684
01:40:47,425 --> 01:40:49,343
Where are they all?

1685
01:40:49,928 --> 01:40:51,637
Hiding.

1686
01:40:51,888 --> 01:40:53,931
Ahem. Sir?

1687
01:40:54,349 --> 01:40:56,475
Couple of Banning Springs water please.

1688
01:40:56,726 --> 01:40:58,435
Right away, Mr. M.

1689
01:41:01,105 --> 01:41:03,524
Do places like this really exist?

1690
01:41:05,109 --> 01:41:06,735
Only in the movies.

1691
01:41:37,475 --> 01:41:40,561
Tell me about the movies you make.

1692
01:41:40,812 --> 01:41:42,479
Why?

1693
01:41:42,981 --> 01:41:47,150
Because I want to know what you do.

1694
01:41:48,152 --> 01:41:53,991
Well, I listen to stories and decide
if they'll make good movies or not.

1695
01:41:54,325 --> 01:41:56,535
I get 125 phone calls a day.

1696
01:41:56,786 --> 01:42:00,372
And if I let that slip to 100...

1697
01:42:00,582 --> 01:42:03,917
...I know I'm not doing my job.

1698
01:42:04,085 --> 01:42:05,502
Oh.

1699
01:42:06,296 --> 01:42:09,590
Everyone that calls,
they wanna know one thing.

1700
01:42:10,383 --> 01:42:13,677
They want me to say yes to them
and make their movie.

1701
01:42:13,928 --> 01:42:16,930
If I say "Yes, I'll make the movie,"
they think come New Years...

1702
01:42:17,098 --> 01:42:21,602
...it's just gonna be them and
Jack Nicholson on the slopes of Aspen.

1703
01:42:22,353 --> 01:42:24,313
That's what they think.

1704
01:42:26,941 --> 01:42:28,692
Problem is...

1705
01:42:28,860 --> 01:42:33,530
...I can only say yes... My studio
can only say yes 12 times a year.

1706
01:42:33,698 --> 01:42:38,368
And collectively,
we hear about 50,000 stories a year.

1707
01:42:38,578 --> 01:42:40,537
So it's hard.

1708
01:42:42,874 --> 01:42:45,751
And I guess sometimes I'm not nice...

1709
01:42:47,253 --> 01:42:49,254
...and make enemies.

1710
01:42:50,715 --> 01:42:53,216
And that's what I was to David.

1711
01:42:54,052 --> 01:42:55,636
Enemy.

1712
01:42:56,387 --> 01:42:58,972
Was his story one of the 12?

1713
01:42:59,223 --> 01:43:01,058
No, it wasn't.

1714
01:43:01,726 --> 01:43:02,934
Why?

1715
01:43:03,144 --> 01:43:07,856
It lacks certain elements that we need
to market a film successfully.

1716
01:43:08,399 --> 01:43:10,442
What elements?

1717
01:43:12,570 --> 01:43:17,574
Suspense, laughter, violence.

1718
01:43:19,369 --> 01:43:21,745
Hope, heart.

1719
01:43:24,082 --> 01:43:26,500
Nudity, sex.

1720
01:43:28,086 --> 01:43:29,586
Happy endings.

1721
01:43:31,172 --> 01:43:33,799
Mainly happy endings.

1722
01:43:37,095 --> 01:43:38,929
What about reality?

1723
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:42,516
You're not from Iceland, are you?

1724
01:43:44,477 --> 01:43:46,436
Did I say that?

1725
01:43:47,563 --> 01:43:48,855
Hmm.

1726
01:43:49,774 --> 01:43:53,777
Why don't you put me in the hot springs
and see if I melt?

1727
01:44:42,034 --> 01:44:43,577
I love you.

1728
01:44:43,828 --> 01:44:47,748
I know. I know.

1729
01:44:55,173 --> 01:44:57,257
I know.

1730
01:44:57,884 --> 01:44:59,843
There's something you have to know.

1731
01:45:00,011 --> 01:45:02,888
- I love you. I know I love you.
- Something I have to tell you.

1732
01:45:03,055 --> 01:45:04,973
That's all I need.

1733
01:45:05,183 --> 01:45:06,725
Nothing can change that.

1734
01:45:06,976 --> 01:45:08,393
June.

1735
01:45:08,603 --> 01:45:10,353
- David's death.
- No. Shh.

1736
01:45:10,521 --> 01:45:12,397
It's in the past.

1737
01:45:12,607 --> 01:45:15,609
Don't. Don't. It's another life.

1738
01:45:15,860 --> 01:45:18,862
I have to tell you something.
Something you have to know.

1739
01:45:19,071 --> 01:45:22,991
Don't, don't, don't say anymore. Don't.

1740
01:45:23,367 --> 01:45:25,410
- I was responsible.
- I love you. Don't.

1741
01:45:25,620 --> 01:45:28,705
- It was my fault.
- Don't say that.

1742
01:45:28,915 --> 01:45:32,876
Don't, don't, don't. I love you.

1743
01:46:51,289 --> 01:46:52,497
Mr. M?

1744
01:46:52,874 --> 01:46:54,749
Mr. M, sorry to disturb you.

1745
01:46:54,917 --> 01:46:57,168
There's a telephone call
and it sounds important.

1746
01:46:57,336 --> 01:46:59,212
- Who is it?
- A Mr. Dick Mellen.

1747
01:46:59,380 --> 01:47:01,339
He says he's your lawyer.

1748
01:47:23,154 --> 01:47:24,738
Dick, how'd you fine me?

1749
01:47:24,947 --> 01:47:28,158
Come on, Griff.
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?

1750
01:47:28,326 --> 01:47:29,993
Yeah. What's going on?

1751
01:47:30,202 --> 01:47:33,496
- Levison's out.
- Out?

1752
01:47:33,664 --> 01:47:35,874
They gave him six hours
to clean out his office.

1753
01:47:36,083 --> 01:47:38,168
- Who's taking over?
- Nothing's been decided.

1754
01:47:38,336 --> 01:47:41,671
All we know is Reggie Goldman
went home with the clap or something.

1755
01:47:42,590 --> 01:47:46,301
- Listen, am I in a position to...?
- I don't wanna talk about studio politics.

1756
01:47:46,469 --> 01:47:48,720
Why didn't you tell me about this
Kahane business?

1757
01:47:50,181 --> 01:47:51,723
Kahane.

1758
01:47:51,933 --> 01:47:53,391
I tried to, Dick, but...

1759
01:47:53,601 --> 01:47:55,226
You didn't try hard enough.

1760
01:47:55,394 --> 01:47:58,396
You better be at the Pasadena
Police Station in about four hours.

1761
01:47:59,815 --> 01:48:02,192
Pasadena? What for?

1762
01:48:02,401 --> 01:48:05,320
A fucking lineup, that's what for.

1763
01:48:05,488 --> 01:48:06,863
They got a witness, evidently.

1764
01:48:07,073 --> 01:48:09,699
Now, look, I found you a guy,
his name is Gar Girard.

1765
01:48:09,867 --> 01:48:12,535
He's a top-flight criminal lawyer.
He's tough, hard-nosed.

1766
01:48:12,703 --> 01:48:15,455
Don't you talk to anybody else.
Just get there.

1767
01:48:16,207 --> 01:48:19,876
- I'll be there.
- Griffin, this is a tough one.

1768
01:48:20,086 --> 01:48:21,419
Good luck.

1769
01:48:22,964 --> 01:48:24,589
Thanks.

1770
01:48:32,974 --> 01:48:37,394
Mr. Mill, the studio's very upset
about the publicity this might generate.

1771
01:48:37,561 --> 01:48:40,438
But I'll handle the press, the police,
the judge and the witness.

1772
01:48:40,606 --> 01:48:43,066
Mr. Mill. Thank you for coming down
without a fight.

1773
01:48:43,234 --> 01:48:45,819
It's in your best interest.
You sleep in that suit?

1774
01:48:45,987 --> 01:48:47,946
Get away from that woman.
She's the enemy.

1775
01:48:48,114 --> 01:48:50,490
- Follow me.
- Susan, I had a lovely time at the Mint.

1776
01:48:50,658 --> 01:48:52,242
I can't believe you remembered it.

1777
01:48:52,451 --> 01:48:54,786
Mr. Mill, Gar Girard.
I'm here to represent you.

1778
01:48:54,996 --> 01:48:57,622
Dick Mellen called me in on this.
Here's the situation.

1779
01:48:57,832 --> 01:49:00,250
They've got a witness.
They want you to do a lineup.

1780
01:49:00,418 --> 01:49:02,544
If you say no, they'll arrest you.

1781
01:49:02,753 --> 01:49:05,588
And even if you get identified,
I'll get you off on bail.

1782
01:49:05,798 --> 01:49:09,592
Now, this witness lives across the street
from the parking lot.

1783
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:12,679
Even if she makes an identification,
a positive ID right now...

1784
01:49:12,888 --> 01:49:16,975
...even if that happens, it was very late
at night. By the time I'm finished with her...

1785
01:49:17,143 --> 01:49:20,603
...the world will have a new legal
standard for blindness. Keep the faith...

1786
01:49:20,813 --> 01:49:23,314
This is just like they do it on television.

1787
01:49:23,524 --> 01:49:25,608
Excuse me, Susan. Good luck.

1788
01:49:25,818 --> 01:49:29,029
You don't have to worry.
You can see them but they can't see you.

1789
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:31,197
- Fine. Fine.
- Just tell the truth.

1790
01:49:31,407 --> 01:49:35,869
Oh, I will. Because
I saw him clearly. There's no problem.

1791
01:49:37,413 --> 01:49:39,372
All right, Allen. Fire it up.

1792
01:49:39,582 --> 01:49:41,791
Number 1, step forward.

1793
01:49:42,084 --> 01:49:44,794
Make a quarter turn to the right.

1794
01:49:45,504 --> 01:49:48,006
- Are those prescription glasses?
- You can't ask her that.

1795
01:49:48,174 --> 01:49:49,883
- Fine.
- It's very hard, you know.

1796
01:49:50,092 --> 01:49:52,927
- Oh, yeah. I know.
- Number 2, take one step forward.

1797
01:49:53,137 --> 01:49:56,306
- I wouldn't wanna pick the wrong one.
- No. God forbid.

1798
01:49:56,849 --> 01:49:58,141
You just take your time.

1799
01:49:58,309 --> 01:50:01,352
Oh, I know.
Anybody look, uh, vaguely familiar?

1800
01:50:01,562 --> 01:50:03,146
Take a quarter turn to the left.

1801
01:50:05,066 --> 01:50:06,816
- Face forward.
- Take your time.

1802
01:50:06,984 --> 01:50:09,235
Step back into position.
Number 3, take one step.

1803
01:50:09,403 --> 01:50:10,987
- This is not easy.
- I know.

1804
01:50:11,155 --> 01:50:13,406
- It never is.
- I mean, I am trying.

1805
01:50:13,616 --> 01:50:15,366
Yes. Just take your time.

1806
01:50:15,534 --> 01:50:17,869
- And I did see him clearly.
- Face forward.

1807
01:50:18,037 --> 01:50:19,329
Make a quarter turn to the left.

1808
01:50:22,875 --> 01:50:25,168
- Step back as...
- No, no, no. I don't know.

1809
01:50:25,419 --> 01:50:26,711
- Well.
- Look hard.

1810
01:50:26,921 --> 01:50:31,382
- Look really... Take a good look.
- No. I did, I did, I am. Um...

1811
01:50:31,592 --> 01:50:33,802
Could I see, um...

1812
01:50:34,762 --> 01:50:36,721
...Number 3 again?
- Call Number 3.

1813
01:50:36,931 --> 01:50:38,973
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
- Um, could I...?

1814
01:50:39,183 --> 01:50:41,476
- Could she call her own numbers?
- Excuse me.

1815
01:50:41,685 --> 01:50:45,313
- Maybe she wants to see again.
- Number 5, take one step forward.

1816
01:50:45,481 --> 01:50:46,815
- Listen...
- Excuse me.

1817
01:50:46,982 --> 01:50:48,066
Number 5.

1818
01:50:48,275 --> 01:50:50,860
Susan, I think she can call
who she's interested in.

1819
01:50:51,028 --> 01:50:54,781
- You're absolutely right.
- No, the other one. That one.

1820
01:50:54,949 --> 01:50:56,533
- By the number.
- Which one?

1821
01:50:56,700 --> 01:51:00,286
- Oh, um, uh, it's not Number 6.
- Not Number 6.

1822
01:51:00,454 --> 01:51:02,080
- How about Number 5?
- Three.

1823
01:51:02,289 --> 01:51:04,207
- Three.
- What do you mean, Number 3?

1824
01:51:04,375 --> 01:51:06,709
- She can request who she wants.
- Just a second.

1825
01:51:06,877 --> 01:51:08,419
You wanna see what number?

1826
01:51:08,587 --> 01:51:12,632
Him! That's him.
I'd swear on my mother's grave.

1827
01:51:12,842 --> 01:51:15,218
Number 3.
I think we're concluded, Ms. Avery.

1828
01:51:15,386 --> 01:51:17,887
- The one, Number 3.
- Number 3. On her mother's grave.

1829
01:51:18,055 --> 01:51:19,556
- Yes.
- Number 3?

1830
01:51:20,057 --> 01:51:21,975
Number 3.
I think we heard what she said.

1831
01:51:22,184 --> 01:51:24,727
- Yeah, I would say so.
- Okay, Doug, take them out.

1832
01:51:24,895 --> 01:51:27,814
- Number 3, thank you.
- Just relax. You're in a chair.

1833
01:51:28,482 --> 01:51:30,525
- Ma'am, may I be personal?
- Yes.

1834
01:51:30,693 --> 01:51:32,443
Where the fuck is your mother buried?

1835
01:51:33,821 --> 01:51:36,239
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's get out of this sauna.

1836
01:51:41,245 --> 01:51:44,831
I don't know who got to that witness,
but she sure wrapped up my case.

1837
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:47,917
- You're a lucky man, Mr. Mill.
- Goddamn it, no ramp again.

1838
01:51:48,127 --> 01:51:49,502
Witnesses can't be relied on.

1839
01:51:49,712 --> 01:51:53,047
Remember Witness for the Prosecution,
Marlene Dietrich and Tyrone Power?

1840
01:51:53,257 --> 01:51:55,842
That's it. You're free as a bird.
No witness, no crime.

1841
01:51:56,051 --> 01:51:58,553
That Avery woman thinks
you just got away with murder.

1842
01:51:58,721 --> 01:52:01,014
Everybody does, Mr. Mill.

1843
01:52:48,437 --> 01:52:53,191
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed by thy name.

1844
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:58,238
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

1845
01:52:58,697 --> 01:53:01,950
Give us this day our daily bread...

1846
01:53:02,159 --> 01:53:05,078
...and forgive us our trespasses...

1847
01:54:43,635 --> 01:54:47,638
You've made a wonderful movie.
It's perfect.

1848
01:54:47,848 --> 01:54:50,641
It's Oscar time, Larry.

1849
01:54:55,731 --> 01:54:58,691
- What?
- We're too late. Come on.

1850
01:54:58,901 --> 01:55:01,194
I gotta get the door open.

1851
01:55:02,571 --> 01:55:04,072
Come on.

1852
01:55:07,326 --> 01:55:09,619
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Get back!

1853
01:55:27,846 --> 01:55:31,057
Oh. What took you so long?

1854
01:55:31,266 --> 01:55:32,725
Traffic was a bitch.

1855
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:44,654
It's outstanding.

1856
01:55:44,863 --> 01:55:48,282
- The audience is gonna love it.
- You sold it out.

1857
01:55:48,450 --> 01:55:51,994
How could you let him sell you out?
What about truth? What about reality?

1858
01:55:52,162 --> 01:55:54,914
What about the way
the old ending tested in Canoga Park?

1859
01:55:55,124 --> 01:55:56,457
Everybody hated it.

1860
01:55:56,667 --> 01:55:59,669
We reshot it. Now everybody loves it.
That's reality.

1861
01:55:59,837 --> 01:56:02,630
You had an ending which was true.
You didn't give it a chance.

1862
01:56:02,798 --> 01:56:06,217
Who is this person? Does she know
anything about working with grown-ups?

1863
01:56:06,427 --> 01:56:08,594
Bonnie, goddamn it, goddamn it.

1864
01:56:08,804 --> 01:56:11,764
This is a hit.
This is what we're here for.

1865
01:56:11,974 --> 01:56:14,016
Yeah, well, it didn't have
to end this way.

1866
01:56:14,226 --> 01:56:17,520
- I want you out of here.
- Good thinking, Larry.

1867
01:56:17,729 --> 01:56:19,730
I'm going over your head, Larry.

1868
01:56:19,940 --> 01:56:22,233
Bonnie, you're fired.

1869
01:56:23,944 --> 01:56:25,278
Fuck you.

1870
01:56:25,487 --> 01:56:28,281
It takes more to make it
in this business than a dirty mouth.

1871
01:56:28,449 --> 01:56:30,324
The campaign.

1872
01:56:52,431 --> 01:56:53,764
Two points.

1873
01:56:59,062 --> 01:57:01,314
Celia, it's important.
I need to talk to him now.

1874
01:57:01,523 --> 01:57:03,274
- No, Bonnie, he's very busy.
- Please.

1875
01:57:03,442 --> 01:57:05,443
- No, you... Bonnie.
- Please, it's me, Bonnie.

1876
01:57:05,652 --> 01:57:07,862
- We're friends.
- Bonnie, you don't understand.

1877
01:57:08,071 --> 01:57:12,742
- I am not just me, I'm also the job.
- Please. Please. Please.

1878
01:57:12,951 --> 01:57:17,955
Oh, honey. All right, all right.
I'll try, okay?

1879
01:57:20,417 --> 01:57:22,335
Three points.

1880
01:57:22,711 --> 01:57:26,297
- Great shot.
- Oh, Walter, stop that nonsense.

1881
01:57:26,507 --> 01:57:29,258
Griffin, it's Bonnie.

1882
01:57:29,468 --> 01:57:31,302
She's here.

1883
01:57:33,222 --> 01:57:35,223
Great shot.

1884
01:57:35,933 --> 01:57:37,058
Levy fired her?

1885
01:57:37,267 --> 01:57:39,685
Yes, sir. I guess he did.

1886
01:57:41,188 --> 01:57:43,272
Well, I can't see her now.

1887
01:57:43,732 --> 01:57:46,025
I promised I'd be home early.

1888
01:57:47,319 --> 01:57:48,736
Tell her I'll get back to her.

1889
01:57:48,946 --> 01:57:51,489
Walter, get your foot
off the fucking couch.

1890
01:57:51,698 --> 01:57:52,782
Tell her yourself.

1891
01:57:52,950 --> 01:57:55,952
- Yes. Okay, well, could you hold, please?
- Griffin. Griffin.

1892
01:57:56,119 --> 01:57:57,203
I have to talk to you.

1893
01:57:57,412 --> 01:57:58,746
- Please!
- It's very important.

1894
01:57:58,914 --> 01:58:02,833
- Griffin, please. Can we talk about it?
- Bonnie, you'll land on your feet. I know it.

1895
01:58:03,001 --> 01:58:05,878
- You're a survivor.
- It's Larry Levy's office. It's important.

1896
01:58:06,088 --> 01:58:08,089
Oh, put it in the front seat.

1897
01:58:08,423 --> 01:58:10,967
Give it a minute and
transfer it to the car phone.

1898
01:58:23,438 --> 01:58:26,482
- Yeah?
- Griffin, I have Larry Levy on the line.

1899
01:58:26,650 --> 01:58:29,026
Larry, how'd the screening go?
How's my new ending?

1900
01:58:29,194 --> 01:58:31,737
Fantastic. Fantastic.
Worked like gangbusters.

1901
01:58:31,947 --> 01:58:35,908
- That's why you get the big bucks, Griff.
- Yeah, yeah. Stop kissing my ass, Larry.

1902
01:58:36,118 --> 01:58:38,995
- What? Can't this wait?
- I don't think it should. This is hot.

1903
01:58:39,162 --> 01:58:41,497
I got a writer who's got a pitch
you ought to hear.

1904
01:58:41,665 --> 01:58:44,000
It's something we should go for.
It's a great idea.

1905
01:58:44,167 --> 01:58:47,670
- Yeah? Who's the writer?
- I'll put him on the speaker. Hold on.

1906
01:58:47,838 --> 01:58:49,463
Hi, Griff. Remember me?

1907
01:58:49,631 --> 01:58:52,967
I'm the asshole who used to be
in the postcard business.

1908
01:58:53,176 --> 01:58:54,802
- You?
- Yeah, that's right.

1909
01:58:55,012 --> 01:58:57,471
The king of suspense himself.
You remember me?

1910
01:58:57,681 --> 01:58:59,515
I haven't heard from you in a while.

1911
01:58:59,725 --> 01:59:02,184
Well, I've been busy.
I've been writing a script.

1912
01:59:02,352 --> 01:59:04,061
- I got inspired.
- Give him the pitch.

1913
01:59:04,271 --> 01:59:06,230
You'll love this, Griffin. It's great.

1914
01:59:06,440 --> 01:59:09,191
All right, it's a Hollywood story,
Griff. A real thriller.

1915
01:59:09,401 --> 01:59:12,695
It's about a shit-bag producer
studio exec...

1916
01:59:12,863 --> 01:59:16,240
...who murders a writer
he thinks is harassing him.

1917
01:59:16,450 --> 01:59:19,368
Problem is, he kills the wrong writer.

1918
01:59:19,578 --> 01:59:22,872
Now he's got to deal with blackmail
as well as the cops.

1919
01:59:23,081 --> 01:59:27,001
But here's the switch.
The son of a bitch, he gets away with it.

1920
01:59:27,169 --> 01:59:29,545
Larry, get off the speaker.
I wanna talk privately.

1921
01:59:29,713 --> 01:59:32,506
Sure thing. This is a winner, Griffin.
It's a winner.

1922
01:59:32,716 --> 01:59:34,675
- He gets away with it?
- Absolutely.

1923
01:59:34,843 --> 01:59:38,220
It's a Hollywood ending, Griff.
He marries the dead writer's girl...

1924
01:59:38,388 --> 01:59:42,099
...and they live happily ever after.
- Can you guarantee that ending?

1925
01:59:42,267 --> 01:59:45,728
- If the price is right, you got it.
- If you can guarantee me that ending...

1926
01:59:45,896 --> 01:59:48,272
...you got a deal.
- I guarantee it, Griff.

1927
01:59:48,482 --> 01:59:51,776
- What do you call this thing anyway?
- The Player.

1928
01:59:51,985 --> 01:59:53,611
The Player.

1929
01:59:56,865 --> 01:59:57,907
I like that.

1930
02:00:01,286 --> 02:00:03,329
What took you so long?

1931
02:00:03,538 --> 02:00:05,998
Traffic was a bitch.
