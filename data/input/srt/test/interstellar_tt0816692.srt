1
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,995
Well, my dad was a farmer.

2
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:20,623
Um, like everybody else back then.

3
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,919
Of course, he didn't start that way.

4
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:33,136
Computer says you're too tight.

5
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:35,847
- Nah, I got this.
- Crossing the Straights.

6
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:40,018
- Shutting it down, Cooper.
- No!

7
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,938
- Shutting it all down.
- No, I need power up!

8
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:49,319
Dad?

9
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:58,369
Sorry, Murph. Go back to bed.

10
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:01,205
- I thought you were the ghost.
- No.

11
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:04,876
There are no such things as ghosts, babe.

12
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:07,211
Grandpa says you can get ghosts.

13
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:13,384
Maybe that's because Grandpa's close
to being one himself. Back to bed.

14
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:15,553
Were you dreaming about the crash?

15
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:19,265
Get your butt back in bed, Murph. Heh.

16
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:47,794
The wheat had died.

17
00:02:48,628 --> 00:02:50,963
The blight came and we had to burn it.

18
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:54,592
And we still had corn.
We had acres of corn.

19
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,011
But, uh, mostly we had dust.

20
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,058
I guess I can't describe it.
It was just constant.

21
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:04,686
Just that steady blow...

22
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,104
...of dirt.

23
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,275
We wore, um, little strips of sheet...

24
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:14,153
...sometimes over our nose and mouth...

25
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,823
...so that we wouldn't breathe
so much of it.

26
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:21,035
When we set the table,
we always set the plate...

27
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:24,122
...upside-down.
Glasses or cups, whatever it was...

28
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,456
...upside-down.

29
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,131
Shake a leg! Murph, get a move on!

30
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:36,759
Tom, 4:00 today, you and me in the barn,
Herbicide Resistance 101.

31
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:38,428
- Check?
- Yes, sir.

32
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:41,639
Not at the table, Murph.

33
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,225
Dad, can you fix this?

34
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,145
What the heck did you do...

35
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:48,479
...to my lander?
- Wasn't me.

36
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:50,523
Let me guess. It was your ghost?

37
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,025
It knocked it off.
It keeps knocking books off.

38
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:54,694
No such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass.

39
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:56,988
- Hey.
- I looked it up. It's called a poltergeist.

40
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:58,406
Dad, tell her.

41
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:00,491
Well, it's not very scientific, Murph.

42
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:02,994
You said science was about admitting
what we don't know.

43
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:05,329
- She's got you there.
- Hey.

44
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:06,998
Start looking after our stuff.

45
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:09,834
Coop.

46
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,797
All right, Murph, you want to talk science?

47
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:19,010
Don't tell me you're afraid of some ghost.
No, you got to go further.

48
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:22,346
You got to record the facts, analyze,
get to the how and the why...

49
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:25,433
...then present your conclusions. Deal?

50
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,518
- Deal.
- All right.

51
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,523
- Have a good day at school.
- Hold up.

52
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:35,151
Parent-teacher conferences. Parent.

53
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:37,278
Not grandparent.

54
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,365
Slow down, turbo!

55
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,828
- That's not a dust storm.
- Nelson's torching his whole crop.

56
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:47,371
Blight?

57
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,957
They're saying
it's the last harvest for okra.

58
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,793
Even

59
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:56,339
He should've planted corn
like the rest of us.

60
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:59,217
Now, be nice to that Miss Hanley.
She's single.

61
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:00,885
What's that supposed to mean?

62
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:04,180
Repopulating the earth.
Start pulling your weight, young man.

63
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:08,309
Why don't you start
minding your own business, old man?

64
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:17,276
All right, Murph, give me second.

65
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:20,112
Uh-huh.

66
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,073
Third.

67
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:25,284
- Find a gear, dumb-ass.
- Grind it!

68
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:26,494
Shut it, Tom!

69
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,206
- What'd you do, Murph?
- Ah, she didn't do nothing.

70
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:32,875
- Blew a tire is all.
- Murphy's Law.

71
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,044
Shut up!

72
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:36,963
- Grab the spare, Tom.
- That is the spare.

73
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,092
Get the patch kit!

74
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:45,596
- How am I supposed to patch it out here?
- You got to figure it out.

75
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,723
I'm not always gonna be here to help you.

76
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,900
What's going on, Murph?

77
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:01,279
Why did you and Mom name me
after something that's bad?

78
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:02,822
We didn't.

79
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,699
Murphy's Law?

80
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:09,745
Murphy's Law doesn't mean
that something bad will happen.

81
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:13,291
What it means is
whatever can happen will happen.

82
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:16,002
And that sounded just fine with us.

83
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,757
Whoa!

84
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,634
Get in.

85
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:26,429
Get in, let's go.

86
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,891
What about the flat tire?

87
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:34,186
Yeah.

88
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:52,163
It's an Indian Air Force drone.
Solar cells could power an entire farm.

89
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,789
Take the wheel, Tom.

90
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,588
Go, go, go!

91
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:03,841
Keep that aimed right at it.

92
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:14,185
Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.

93
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:15,895
Right at it.

94
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:18,439
Stay on it.

95
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:21,108
Here we go.

96
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:25,237
Whoa.

97
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:31,953
Nice one, Tom.

98
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,794
Dad?

99
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:42,964
I almost got it. Don't stop. Don't stop!

100
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:44,465
Dad!

101
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,008
Torn!

102
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,890
You told me to keep driving.

103
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:58,187
Well, I guess that answers the old
"If I asked you to drive off a cliff" scenario.

104
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:04,235
- We lost it.
- No, we didn't.

105
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,582
Want to give it a whirl?

106
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:25,965
This way.

107
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,430
Go.

108
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:36,434
Let's lay her down right there
at the edge of the reservoir.

109
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,440
Nicely done.

110
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:47,319
How long you think it's been up there?

111
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:52,033
Delhi Mission Control went down, same
as ours ten years ago.

112
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,285
So for ten years?

113
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,874
- Why did it come down so low?
- I don't know.

114
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,960
Maybe the sun cooked its brain
or it was looking for something.

115
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:05,379
- What?
- Give me a large flatblade.

116
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,466
Maybe some kind of signal? I don't know.

117
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:15,222
What are you gonna do with it?

118
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,310
I'm gonna give it something
socially responsible to do...

119
00:09:20,186 --> 00:09:21,520
...like drive a combine.

120
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:23,606
Can't we just let it go?

121
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,568
It wasn't hurting anybody.

122
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,739
This thing needs to learn
how to adapt, Murph...

123
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:33,532
...like the rest of us.

124
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,830
How's this work?
You guys come with?

125
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,040
I've got class.

126
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:43,834
This one needs to wait.

127
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:48,172
- What did you do?
- They'll tell you about it in there.

128
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:50,508
- Am I gonna be mad?
- Not with me.

129
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:53,844
- Just please try not to.
- Hey. Relax.

130
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,597
I got this.

131
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,144
Little late, Coop.

132
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:03,854
Yeah, we had a flat.

133
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:07,566
And I guess you had to stop off
at the Asian fighter plane store.

134
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:11,445
No, actually, sir,
that's a surveillance drone.

135
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:14,365
With outstanding solar cells. It's Indian.

136
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:16,117
Take a seat.

137
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:18,744
So, uh...

138
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,039
...we got Tom's scores back.

139
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,542
He's going to make an excellent farmer.

140
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:28,212
Yeah, he's got a knack for it.
What about college?

141
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:32,133
The university only takes a handful.
They don't have the resources to...

142
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,593
I still pay my taxes.

143
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,762
Where's that money go?
There's no more armies.

144
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:39,598
Well, it doesn't go to the university.

145
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,809
Look, Coop, you have to be realistic.

146
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:44,770
You're ruling my son out for college now?

147
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,816
- The kid's 15.
- Tom's score simply isn't high enough.

148
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:51,986
What's your waistline? About what, 32?

149
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:56,073
- About a 33 inseam?
- I'm not sure I see what you're getting at.

150
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,661
It takes two numbers to measure your ass
but only one to measure my son's future?

151
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:04,415
Come on. You're a well-educated man, Coop.

152
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:06,542
- And a trained pilot.
- And an engineer.

153
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:11,797
Okay, well, right now
we don't need more engineers.

154
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:16,594
We didn't run out of television screens
and planes. We ran out of food.

155
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:20,347
The world needs farmers.
Good farmers, like you.

156
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,892
- And Tom.
- Uneducated farmers.

157
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:27,730
We're a caretaker generation, Coop.
And things are getting better.

158
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:31,025
- Maybe your grandkids will get to be engin...
- Are we done here, sir?

159
00:11:32,318 --> 00:11:33,402
No.

160
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:36,405
Miss Hanley's here to talk about Murph.

161
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:39,283
Murph is a great kid. She's really bright.

162
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,702
But she's been having
a little trouble lately.

163
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:45,247
She brought this in to show the students.
The section on the lunar landings.

164
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,917
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.

165
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,377
She always loved the pictures.

166
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:54,256
It's an old federal textbook. We've
replaced them with the corrected versions.

167
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:55,466
Corrected?

168
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:59,762
Explaining how the Apollo missions were faked
to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

169
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:08,437
You don't believe we went to the moon'?

170
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,565
It was a brilliant piece of propaganda.

171
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:14,568
The Soviets bankrupted themselves
pouring resources...

172
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,987
...into rockets and other useless machines.

173
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,239
"Useless machines."

174
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:22,493
If we don't want a repeat of the excess
and wastefulness of the 20th century, then...

175
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,455
...we need to teach our kids about
this planet, not tales of leaving it.

176
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:31,293
One of those useless machines
they used to make was called an MRI.

177
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:35,005
If we had any of those left,
the doctors would've been able to find...

178
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:38,926
...the cyst in my wife's brain
before she died instead of afterwards.

179
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:42,179
Then she'd have been the one
listening to this instead of me...

180
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:45,432
...which would have been a good thing,
because she was always...

181
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,518
...the calmer one.

182
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,271
I'm sorry about your wife, Mr. Cooper.

183
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:55,192
But Murph got into a fistfight
with several of her classmates over this...

184
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:57,027
...Apollo nonsense.

185
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:59,655
So we thought it best
to bring you in and see what ideas...

186
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:02,491
...you might have for dealing
with her behavior on the home front.

187
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:06,745
Yeah, you know what?
Um, there's a game tomorrow night.

188
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:09,039
She's going through a bit of
a baseball phase.

189
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:13,419
Her favorite team is playing.
There's gonna be candy and soda and...

190
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:18,340
I think I'll take her to that.

191
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:24,930
How'd it go?

192
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:27,725
I got you suspended.

193
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:29,476
- What?
- Cooper.

194
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:32,396
This is Cooper. Go.

195
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:35,399
Coop, those combines you rebuilt
went haywire.

196
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:37,735
Just reset the controllers.

197
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,696
I did that.
Now you should come take a look.

198
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:03,427
One by one they've been
peeling off the fields and heading over.

199
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,429
Something's interfering with the compass.

200
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,308
Magnetism or some such.

201
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:53,894
Nothing special about which book.

202
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,814
I've been working on it, like you said.

203
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,067
- I counted the spaces.
- Why?

204
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:04,196
In case the ghost is trying to communicate.

205
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,532
I'm trying Morse.

206
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:08,367
Morse?

207
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,785
Yeah.

208
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:12,830
- Dots and dashes, used...
- I know what Morse code is, Murph.

209
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,916
I just don't think
your bookshelf's trying to talk to you.

210
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:31,890
Had to reset every compass clock and GPS
to offset for the anomaly.

211
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,726
- Which is?
- I don't know.

212
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,647
If the house was built on magnetic ore...

213
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:41,900
...we'd have seen this the first time
we switched on the tractor.

214
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,739
I hear your meeting at the school
didn't go so well.

215
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,075
Heh. You heard?

216
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,871
It's like we've forgotten
who we are, Donald.

217
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:59,042
Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.

218
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,379
When I was a kid...

219
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:06,675
...it felt like they made something new
every day. Some...

220
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,345
...gadget or idea.
Like every day was Christmas.

221
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,474
But six billion people...

222
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:15,893
...just try to imagine that.

223
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:19,897
And every last one of them
trying to have it all.

224
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:25,194
This world isn't so bad.

225
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:29,656
And Tom will do just fine.

226
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:34,203
You're the one who doesn't belong.
Born 40 years too late, or 40 years too early.

227
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:37,706
My daughter knew it, God bless her.

228
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:41,376
And your kids know it. Especially Murph.

229
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:45,130
Well, we used to look up in the sky
and wonder...

230
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:47,674
...at our place in the stars.

231
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:54,473
Now we just look down and worry
about our place in the dirt.

232
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:57,809
Cooper, you were good at something...

233
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:00,646
...and you never got a chance
to do anything with it.

234
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:02,773
I'm sorry.

235
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:05,901
You didn't expect...

236
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:12,032
...this dirt that was giving you this food
to turn on you like that and destroy you.

237
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:16,662
In April... I believe I'm right...
Fifteenth of April, I think.

238
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,414
This happened about 1:30 when that thing...

239
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,500
...came off the top of that canyon.

240
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,337
In my day, we had real ballplayers.

241
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:27,256
Who are these bums?

242
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:30,133
In my day, people were too busy...

243
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,344
...fighting over food
to even play baseball.

244
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:37,516
Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural.
I want a hot dog.

245
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:39,810
School says you're gonna follow
in my footsteps.

246
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:42,062
I think that's great.

247
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:45,649
- You think that's great?
- You hate farming, Dad.

248
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,068
Grandpa said.

249
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,653
Grandpa said, huh?

250
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,614
Listen, all that matters
is how you feel about it.

251
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:54,449
I like what you do.

252
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,660
I like our farm.

253
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,954
You're gonna be great at it.

254
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,302
Let's get out of here.

255
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,561
All right, it's a doozy.

256
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,105
All right, gang, let's mask up.

257
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:30,444
- Tom? Murph? Check?
- Yeah.

258
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,583
Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows?

259
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,089
Murph?

260
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:54,778
The ghost.

261
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,656
Grab your pillow.

262
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,283
You're sleeping in with Tom.

263
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:56,882
It's not a ghost.

264
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:03,722
It's gravity.

265
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:07,726
I'm dropping Torn, then heading to town.

266
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:12,189
You want to clean that up
when you've finished praying to it?

267
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:39,800
It's not Morse, Murph. It's binary.

268
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,260
Thick is one, thin is zero.

269
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,058
Coordinates.

270
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:53,146
Nope. Mm-mm.

271
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:55,774
Here we go.

272
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,735
Thirty-three.

273
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:02,739
That's it.

274
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,700
I can't miss this!

275
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:09,204
Grandpa will be back
in a couple hours, Murph.

276
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,666
But you don't know what you're gonna find.

277
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,001
And that...

278
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:18,171
...is why I can't take you.

279
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:25,387
Murph?

280
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:30,976
Grandpa will be home in a while.
Tell him I'll call him on the radio.

281
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,400
- Aah!
- Jesus.

282
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,319
- What are you doing?
- Heh-heh.

283
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:43,613
Oh, you think this is funny? Huh?

284
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,283
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.

285
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:50,120
Make yourself useful.

286
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:54,809
Hey, Murph?

287
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:57,479
Murphy

288
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:03,318
I think this is the end of the road.

289
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,365
Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?

290
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:10,784
That's my girl.

291
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,771
Step away!

292
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:43,024
Don't shoot! I'm not armed.
My daughter's in the car.

293
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:50,824
- Don't be afraid.
- Aah!

294
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:05,630
How did you find this place?

295
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:07,674
Where's my daughter?

296
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:11,886
You had the coordinates for this facility
marked on your map. Where did you get them?

297
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:13,388
Where's my daughter?

298
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:16,474
Don't make me take you down again.
Sit down!

299
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:19,019
Oh, you still think you're a Marine, pal?

300
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,771
Marines don't exist anymore.

301
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:27,027
- And I got grunts like you mowing my grass.
- Where did you find those coordinates?

302
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,779
But you don't look much like a lawnmower.

303
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:32,782
Think I'll turn you
into an overqualified vacuum cleaner.

304
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:34,159
No, you won't.

305
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:37,704
TARS, back down, please.

306
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:42,333
You know, you're taking a risk
using ex-military security.

307
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:46,629
They're old, and their control units
are unpredictable.

308
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:48,798
It's what the government could spare.

309
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:51,634
Who are you?

310
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:53,428
Dr. Brand.

311
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:55,972
I knew a Dr. Brand once.
He was a professor.

312
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:57,849
What makes you think I'm not?

313
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:00,643
Wasn't near as cute, either.

314
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:03,480
Please, Dr. Brand.
I don't have any idea what this is.

315
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:06,816
Now I'm scared for my daughter
and want her by my side.

316
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:09,444
You give me that,
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

317
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:15,825
Get the principals and the girl
in the conference room, please.

318
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,536
Your daughter is fine.

319
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:20,038
Bright kid.

320
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:22,457
Must have a very smart mother.

321
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:25,043
It's pretty clear you don't want
any visitors.

322
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:29,172
So why don't you just let us back up from
your fence and we'll be on our way? Huh?

323
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:32,008
- It's not that simple.
- Well, sure, it is.

324
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:36,012
I don't know anything about you.
I don't know anything about this place.

325
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:38,056
Yes, you do.

326
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,854
Dad!

327
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:48,566
Hello, Cooper.

328
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:51,069
Professor Brand.

329
00:26:53,238 --> 00:26:55,198
Explain to me how you found this facility.

330
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:58,660
Kind of an accident. We sort of stumbled
upon it. We were on a salvage run...

331
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:01,538
You're sitting in the best-kept secret
in the world.

332
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:05,208
Nobody stumbles in here.
Nobody stumbles out.

333
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:07,210
Cooper, please.

334
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,754
Cooperate with these people.

335
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:11,131
Look.

336
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:13,716
It's kind of hard to explain.

337
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:18,221
We learned these coordinates
from an anomaly.

338
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:20,306
What sort of anomaly?

339
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:23,768
I hesitate to term it supernatural,
but it definitely wasn't scientific.

340
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:27,856
You're going to have to be specific,
Mr. Cooper. Right now.

341
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:29,274
It was gravity.

342
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:37,157
Um, what sort of gravitational anomaly?
Where was this?

343
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:40,618
Now, I'm real happy that you're excited
about gravity, bud...

344
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:43,997
...but you're not getting any answers
from us until I get assurances.

345
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:45,456
- Assurances?
- Yeah.

346
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:49,752
Like, that we're getting out of here.
And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.

347
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:54,424
Don't you know who we are, Coop?

348
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:55,842
No, professor, I don't.

349
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:58,011
You know my father, Professor Brand.

350
00:27:58,636 --> 00:27:59,929
We're NASA.

351
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:03,933
- NASA?
- NASA.

352
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:06,060
The same NASA you flew for.

353
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:18,781
I heard they shut you down, sir...

354
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:21,242
...for refusing to drop bombs
from the stratosphere...

355
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:22,952
...onto starving people.

356
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,455
When they realized
that killing other people was...

357
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:28,458
...not a long-term solution,
then they needed us back.

358
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,627
- In secret.
- Why secret?

359
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:34,631
Because public opinion wouldn't allow
spending on space exploration.

360
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:37,383
Not while you're struggling
to put food on the table.

361
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:39,969
Blight.

362
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:44,265
Wheat seven years ago. Okra this year.

363
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:46,684
Now there's just corn.

364
00:28:47,018 --> 00:28:48,978
And we're growing more than we ever have.

365
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:53,316
But like the potatoes in Ireland
and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...

366
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,402
...the corn will die.

367
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:58,196
Soon.

368
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:07,080
We'll find a way, professor.
We always have.

369
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,834
Driven by the unshakable faith
the Earth is ours.

370
00:29:12,335 --> 00:29:14,212
Not just ours, no.

371
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:16,339
But it is our home.

372
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:21,010
Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.

373
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:22,887
We don't even breathe nitrogen.

374
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:28,393
Blight does. And as it thrives,
our air gets less and less oxygen.

375
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,021
The last people to starve
will be the first to suffocate.

376
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:34,357
And your daughter's generation...

377
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:38,278
...will be the last to survive on Earth.

378
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:42,031
Murph is tired. I was wondering
if she could take a nap in my office.

379
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:44,033
Yeah. Thank you.

380
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:52,375
Now you need to tell me
what your plan is to save the world.

381
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:56,546
We're not meant to save the world.
We're meant to leave it.

382
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:03,428
Rangers.

383
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,683
The last components of our one versatile ship
in orbit, the Endurance.

384
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:10,601
Our final expedition.

385
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:14,355
You sent people out there
looking for a new home?

386
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,274
The Lazarus missions.

387
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:19,569
- Oh, that sounds cheerful.
- Lazarus came back from the dead.

388
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,904
Sure, but he had to die in the first place.

389
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,241
There's not a planet in our solar system
that could sustain life...

390
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:27,910
...and the nearest star's
over a thousand years away.

391
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:30,747
That doesn't even qualify as futile.

392
00:30:32,415 --> 00:30:33,750
Where'd you send them?

393
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:35,585
Cooper...

394
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:38,546
...I can't tell you anymore
unless you agree...

395
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:40,548
...to pilot this craft.

396
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:44,010
- You're the best pilot we ever had.
- I barely left the stratosphere.

397
00:30:44,302 --> 00:30:46,429
This team never left the simulator.

398
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:50,558
We need a pilot, and this is the mission
that you were trained for.

399
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:52,226
Without even knowing it?

400
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:57,523
An hour ago, you didn't even know I was alive.
You were going anyway.

401
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,400
We had no choice.

402
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:01,319
But something sent you here.

403
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:04,364
- They chose you.
- Who's "they"?

404
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,248
How long would I be gone?

405
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:17,752
Hard to know. Years?

406
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:20,088
I've got kids, professor.

407
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:22,632
Get out there and save them.

408
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,387
Who's "they"?

409
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:31,349
We started detecting gravitational anomalies
almost 50 years ago.

410
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:35,311
Mostly small distortions to our instruments
in the upper atmosphere.

411
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:38,606
In fact, I believe
you encountered one yourself.

412
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:41,275
Yeah, over the Straights.

413
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:45,321
My crash. Something tripped my fly-by-wire.

414
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:46,697
Exactly.

415
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:52,453
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this:

416
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,622
Out near Saturn...

417
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:56,874
...a disturbance of space-time.

418
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:02,130
- Is that a Wormhole?
- It appeared 48 years ago.

419
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,507
And it leads where?

420
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:06,676
Another galaxy.

421
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:10,680
A wormhole's not
a naturally occurring phenomenon.

422
00:32:10,847 --> 00:32:12,265
Someone placed it there.

423
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,559
- "They"?
- Mm.

424
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:19,147
And whoever they are,
they appear to be looking out for us.

425
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,191
That Wormhole lets us travel
to other stars.

426
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:24,277
It came along right as we needed it.

427
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:27,363
They've put potentially habitable worlds
right within our reach.

428
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,449
Twelve, in fact, from our initial probes.

429
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,993
- You sent probes into that?
- Mm-hm.

430
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,163
We sent people into it. Ten years ago.

431
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,166
The Lazarus missions.

432
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:39,709
Twelve possible worlds...

433
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:42,211
...twelve Ranger launches carrying...

434
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,089
...the bravest humans ever to live...

435
00:32:45,256 --> 00:32:47,884
...led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

436
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,387
Each person's landing pod
had enough life support for two years.

437
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:53,514
But they could use hibernation
to stretch that...

438
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:56,893
...making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

439
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:00,897
Their mission was to assess their world,
and if it showed potential...

440
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:05,651
...then they could send out a signal,
bed down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.

441
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,862
And what if the world didn't show promise?

442
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:09,906
Hence the bravery.

443
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:13,242
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12.

444
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:14,535
No.

445
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:18,206
Data transmission back through
the Wormhole is rudimentary.

446
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:23,419
Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us
some clue as to which worlds have potential.

447
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:25,379
And one system shows promise.

448
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:28,257
One. That's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?

449
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:31,928
One system with three potential worlds?

450
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:33,930
No long shot.

451
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,225
Okay.

452
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:40,269
So if we find a home...

453
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:46,400
- ...then what?
- That's the long shot.

454
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:49,946
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

455
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:53,407
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

456
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:08,047
This entire facility's a centrifuge.

457
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:10,883
Some kind of vehicle. A space station?

458
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:12,969
Both. Plan A.

459
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:15,221
How do you get it off the ground?

460
00:34:15,388 --> 00:34:19,058
The first gravitational anomalies
changed everything.

461
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:23,729
Suddenly we knew
that harnessing gravity was real.

462
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:28,734
So I started working on a theory
and we started building this station.

463
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,195
But you haven't solved it yet.

464
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,823
That's why there's Plan B.

465
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:39,036
The problem is gravity. How to get
a viable amount of human life off the planet.

466
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:40,496
This is one way.

467
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,332
Plan B: a population bomb.

468
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:48,421
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

469
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,631
How would you raise them?

470
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,259
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

471
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:57,305
After that, with surrogacy,
the growth becomes exponential.

472
00:34:58,014 --> 00:35:01,309
Within 30 years,
we could have a colony of hundreds.

473
00:35:01,475 --> 00:35:04,854
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

474
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,023
This takes care of that.

475
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:11,360
But what about the people here? You just
give up on them?

476
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:13,237
My kids?

477
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:17,116
That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

478
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:22,246
- How far have you got?
- Almost there.

479
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:24,832
You're asking me to hang everything...

480
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,209
...on an almost.

481
00:35:27,752 --> 00:35:30,046
I'm asking you to trust me.

482
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:34,800
Find us a new home.

483
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:37,553
And by the time you return...

484
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:40,806
...I will have solved
the problem of gravity.

485
00:35:41,766 --> 00:35:43,351
I give you my word.

486
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:57,490
Go away!

487
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:09,210
Murph.

488
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:12,588
Go! If you're leaving, just go.

489
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:18,219
This world was never enough
for you, was it, Coop?

490
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:22,807
What, because heading out there
is what I feel like I was born to do?

491
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:25,601
And it excites me? Heh.

492
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,771
No, that does not make it wrong.

493
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:30,064
It might.

494
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:33,567
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

495
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:36,654
The why of the thing,
that's the foundation.

496
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:38,906
And the foundation's solid.

497
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:47,081
We farmers, we sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say:

498
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:48,624
"Next year."

499
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,962
Well, next year ain't gonna save us,
nor the one after that.

500
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:57,925
This world's a treasure, Donald,
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.

501
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:06,434
Mankind was born on Earth,
it was never meant to die here.

502
00:37:09,562 --> 00:37:12,773
Torn will be all right, but you got
to make things right with Murph.

503
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,983
I Will.

504
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:18,112
Without making promises
you don't know you can keep.

505
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:30,750
You have to talk to me, Murph.

506
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:35,379
I need to fix this before I go.

507
00:37:35,546 --> 00:37:38,424
Then I'll keep it broken
so you have to stay.

508
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:45,014
After you kids came along, your mom said
something to me I never quite understood.

509
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:47,016
She said, "Now...

510
00:37:48,893 --> 00:37:53,397
...we're just here
to be memories for our kids."

511
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:01,030
And I think that now I understand
what she meant.

512
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:08,537
Once you're a parent,
you're the ghost of your children's future.

513
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:12,333
You said ghosts didn't exist.

514
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:20,299
That's right, Murph.

515
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:24,845
Murph, look at me.

516
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,392
I can't be your ghost right now.

517
00:38:32,186 --> 00:38:34,188
I need to exist.

518
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:37,733
They chose me.

519
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:42,404
Murph, they chose me. You saw.
You're the one who led me to them.

520
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:47,535
That's exactly why you can't go.

521
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:52,706
I figured out the message.

522
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:56,335
- One word. Know what it is?
- Murph.

523
00:38:56,502 --> 00:38:57,837
"Stay."

524
00:38:58,212 --> 00:39:01,090
- It says, "Stay," Dad.
- Murph.

525
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:03,509
You don't believe me.

526
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:06,470
Look at the books! Look at this.
It says, "Stay."

527
00:39:06,637 --> 00:39:09,598
Why...? You're not listening!
It says, "Stay!"

528
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:11,767
No, I'm coming back.

529
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:13,269
When?

530
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:28,742
One for you, one for me.

531
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:32,288
When I'm up there in hypersleep, or...

532
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:35,165
...traveling near the speed of light, or...

533
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,294
...near a black hole...

534
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:43,299
...time's gonna change for me.
It's gonna run more slowly.

535
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:46,677
When we get back...

536
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:49,221
...we're gonna compare.

537
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:52,016
- Time will run differently for us?
- Yeah.

538
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:57,771
By the time I get back,
we might even be the same age, you and me.

539
00:39:58,147 --> 00:40:00,482
"What?" Imagine that!

540
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:06,196
Aw, Murph...

541
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:08,991
You have no idea when you're coming back.

542
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:12,286
No idea at all!

543
00:40:15,414 --> 00:40:17,541
Murph, don't...
Don't make me leave like this.

544
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:19,209
Come on, Murph!

545
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,046
Don't make me leave like this, Murph!

546
00:40:29,637 --> 00:40:30,679
Hey...

547
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:32,556
...I love you.

548
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:34,850
Forever. You hear me?

549
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:38,520
I love you forever, and I'm coming back.

550
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:45,653
I'm coming back.

551
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:06,048
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

552
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:08,258
Just fine.

553
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:15,849
I love you, Tom.

554
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:18,519
- Travel safe, huh?
- Yeah.

555
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:20,938
You look after our place for me, all right?

556
00:41:21,105 --> 00:41:22,731
- All right?
- Uh-huh.

557
00:41:27,236 --> 00:41:30,614
- Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?
- You mean your truck?

558
00:41:32,116 --> 00:41:33,742
I'll make sure they bring it back.

559
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,663
Look after my kids, Donald!

560
00:41:50,134 --> 00:41:53,762
Go for main engine start. T-minus 10...

561
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:56,515
- Dad!
- ...nine...

562
00:41:56,682 --> 00:41:57,933
Dad!

563
00:41:58,559 --> 00:41:59,601
...eight...

564
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:02,021
...seven...

565
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:03,439
Dad!

566
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:04,815
...six...

567
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:09,111
...five, main engine start, four...

568
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:11,613
...three...

569
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:13,407
...two...

570
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:16,410
...one. Booster ignition and...

571
00:42:25,878 --> 00:42:28,338
All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.

572
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:35,471
Prepare for stage one separation.

573
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:36,847
Stage one.

574
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:44,646
There is Mach 1.

575
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:49,318
Everybody good?
Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?

576
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:54,490
They gave him a humor setting
so he'd fit in better with his unit.

577
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:56,492
He thinks it relaxes us.

578
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:59,453
A giant sarcastic robot.

579
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:01,747
What a great idea!

580
00:43:01,914 --> 00:43:04,625
I have a cue light I can use
when I'm joking if you like.

581
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:05,834
That'd probably help.

582
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:09,922
You can use it to find your way back
to the ship after I blow you out the airlock.

583
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:14,009
- What's your humor setting, TARS?
- That's 100 percent.

584
00:43:14,176 --> 00:43:15,969
Let's bring it on down to 75, please.

585
00:43:16,303 --> 00:43:18,138
Stage two separation.

586
00:43:28,816 --> 00:43:30,984
All feeds going manual.

587
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:32,694
Going manual.

588
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:37,157
Deactivate probe heater one, two and three.

589
00:43:37,324 --> 00:43:38,367
Check.

590
00:43:43,956 --> 00:43:46,875
- Taking control.
- This is handover to you.

591
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:53,006
- A.D.F. check.
- Over.

592
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:57,010
Pull thrusters back.
Fuel cells one, two, three.

593
00:43:57,177 --> 00:43:58,512
One hundred percent.

594
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:00,514
Ex-mites.

595
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:11,316
It's hard leaving everything.

596
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:14,194
My kids. Your father.

597
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,197
We're going to be spending
a lot of time together.

598
00:44:17,364 --> 00:44:20,409
- We should learn to talk.
- And when not to.

599
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:24,246
Just being honest.

600
00:44:24,413 --> 00:44:26,748
I don't think you need to be that honest.

601
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:29,585
Hey, TARS, what's your honesty parameter?

602
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:32,379
- Ninety percent.
- Ninety percent?

603
00:44:32,546 --> 00:44:35,591
Absolute honesty isn't always
the most diplomatic, nor the...

604
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:38,343
...safest form of communication
with emotional beings.

605
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:39,970
Okay.

606
00:44:40,429 --> 00:44:43,056
Ninety percent it is, Dr. Brand.

607
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:49,980
We are coming up on the Endurance.
Twelve minutes out.

608
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,082
Okay. Taking control.

609
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:15,422
Approaching module port, 500 meters.

610
00:45:28,435 --> 00:45:29,561
It's all you, Doyle.

611
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:50,582
Nice and easy, Doyle. Nice and easy.

612
00:45:55,754 --> 00:45:57,005
I feel good.

613
00:45:57,172 --> 00:45:58,340
Take us home.

614
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:08,475
- Lock.
- Target locked.

615
00:46:08,642 --> 00:46:10,477
- Well done.
- Okay, helmets on.

616
00:46:10,644 --> 00:46:11,687
Good job.

617
00:46:45,137 --> 00:46:46,888
Door's not charging.

618
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:48,557
Never mind.

619
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:13,040
Cooper, you should have control.

620
00:47:13,373 --> 00:47:14,875
Control here.

621
00:47:16,293 --> 00:47:18,920
Communication with ring module active.

622
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:26,928
Oh, wow.

623
00:47:32,726 --> 00:47:33,894
That's initiate.

624
00:47:41,443 --> 00:47:43,945
- Are we ready to spin?
- Just a sec.

625
00:47:55,374 --> 00:47:57,709
- Hello, CASE.
- Hello, TARS.

626
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:00,587
All right, we're all set.

627
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:02,547
All right, let's do it.

628
00:48:20,857 --> 00:48:22,359
Heh.

629
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:32,994
Thirty percent of spin.

630
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:41,253
One G.

631
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:44,005
How's gravity treating you back there?

632
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:45,507
Well.

633
00:48:48,677 --> 00:48:50,470
Romilly? Hey, you okay?

634
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:51,680
- Yeah.
- You all right?

635
00:48:51,847 --> 00:48:53,932
Mm. Yeah, I just need a minute.

636
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:59,020
We have some Dramamine in the hab pod,
or maybe in the cryo-beds. I'll just be a sec.

637
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:01,356
- Hey, Brand?
- Yeah?

638
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:03,525
- Bring a lot.
- Heh-heh-heh.

639
00:49:11,992 --> 00:49:14,870
Amelia, be safe.

640
00:49:15,203 --> 00:49:18,707
- Give my regards to Dr. Mann.
- I will, Dad.

641
00:49:18,874 --> 00:49:20,792
It looks good for your trajectory.

642
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:24,296
We've calculated two years to Saturn.

643
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:26,548
That's a lot of Dramamine.

644
00:49:27,257 --> 00:49:29,718
Look after my family,
will you, please, sir?

645
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:33,054
We'll be waiting for you when you get back.

646
00:49:33,555 --> 00:49:37,392
A little older, a little wiser,
but happy to see you.

647
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:43,565
Do not go gentle into that good night.

648
00:49:44,232 --> 00:49:48,278
Old age should burn and rave
at close of day.

649
00:49:49,446 --> 00:49:54,409
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

650
00:49:55,285 --> 00:49:59,080
Though wise men at their end
Know dark is right.

651
00:49:59,414 --> 00:50:02,292
Because their words had forked
No lightning they.

652
00:50:02,709 --> 00:50:06,254
Do not go gentle into that good night.

653
00:50:06,922 --> 00:50:11,259
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

654
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:29,528
- You good?
- Yeah.

655
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:31,947
Okay, thank you.

656
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:36,785
Here. Pills.

657
00:50:39,538 --> 00:50:40,956
So alone.

658
00:50:41,456 --> 00:50:43,416
We have each other. Dr. Mann had it worse.

659
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,960
No, I mean them.

660
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:46,253
Hm?

661
00:50:46,419 --> 00:50:49,714
It's a perfect planet,
and we won't find another one like her.

662
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:53,552
No, it's not like looking for a new condo.

663
00:50:54,678 --> 00:50:56,846
The human race is going to be...

664
00:50:57,347 --> 00:50:58,390
...adrift...

665
00:50:58,557 --> 00:51:02,060
...desperate for a rock it can cling to
while it catches its breath.

666
00:51:02,644 --> 00:51:04,479
We need to find that rock.

667
00:51:04,813 --> 00:51:07,524
And our three prospects
are at the edge of what...

668
00:51:07,691 --> 00:51:09,568
...might sustain human life.

669
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:12,529
Laura Miller's planet is first.

670
00:51:12,696 --> 00:51:14,823
- Laura started our biology program.
- Mm-hm.

671
00:51:19,828 --> 00:51:22,998
- Uh, Wolf Edmunds is here.
- Tell me about Edmunds.

672
00:51:23,832 --> 00:51:26,585
Oh, uh, Wolf's a particle physicist.

673
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:31,214
None of them had families, huh?

674
00:51:32,257 --> 00:51:35,135
No. No attachments. My father insisted.

675
00:51:35,302 --> 00:51:38,847
They all knew the odds against
ever seeing another human being again.

676
00:51:39,014 --> 00:51:40,974
I'm hoping we can surprise
at least three of them.

677
00:51:41,141 --> 00:51:43,059
- How about Mann?
- Dr. Mann?

678
00:51:43,226 --> 00:51:45,145
He's remarkable. He's the best of us.

679
00:51:45,312 --> 00:51:49,691
He inspired 11 people to follow him
on the loneliest journey in human history.

680
00:51:49,858 --> 00:51:51,443
Scientists, explorers.

681
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:55,697
That's what I love.
You know, out there we face great odds.

682
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:57,616
Death, but...

683
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:00,702
...not evil.

684
00:52:00,994 --> 00:52:02,746
You don't think nature can be evil?

685
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:05,790
No. Formidable. Frightening. But...

686
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:08,585
- ...no, not evil.
- Hm.

687
00:52:09,836 --> 00:52:13,048
Is a lion evil
because it rips a gazelle to shreds?

688
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:15,550
Just what we take with us, then.

689
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:17,135
Yeah.

690
00:52:17,552 --> 00:52:19,638
This crew represents the best of humanity.

691
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:20,972
Even me, huh?

692
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:23,141
You know what? We agreed, 90 percent.

693
00:52:23,308 --> 00:52:24,392
There you go.

694
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:27,187
- Don't stay up.
- I'll be there in a minute.

695
00:52:27,354 --> 00:52:31,399
Just remember, Coop,
you are literally wasting your breath.

696
00:52:38,073 --> 00:52:41,242
Hey, TARS?
Let's go over that trajectory one more time.

697
00:52:41,576 --> 00:52:43,244
Eight months to Mars.

698
00:52:43,745 --> 00:52:46,581
Counter-orbital slingshot around.
Fourteen months to Saturn.

699
00:52:46,748 --> 00:52:48,166
Nothing's changed on that.

700
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:50,418
Just let me ask you something.

701
00:52:52,671 --> 00:52:56,132
- Dr. Brand and Edmunds...
- Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.

702
00:52:57,592 --> 00:53:00,595
Dr. Brand and Edmunds. They close?

703
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:02,180
I wouldn't know.

704
00:53:02,347 --> 00:53:05,350
Is that 90 percent "wouldn't know"
or 10 percent "wouldn't know"?

705
00:53:05,517 --> 00:53:08,645
- I also have a discretion setting, Cooper.
- Aah.

706
00:53:10,105 --> 00:53:12,273
But not a poker face, Slick.

707
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:25,870
Hey, guys.

708
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:29,374
Uh, Dad's about to go down
for the long nap.

709
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:32,335
So I wanted to give you an update.

710
00:53:32,502 --> 00:53:33,628
Uh...

711
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:37,882
The Earth looks amazing from here. Um...

712
00:53:38,425 --> 00:53:41,261
You can't see any of the dust. Heh.

713
00:53:41,428 --> 00:53:45,557
Um, I really hope you guys are doing great.

714
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:50,145
I know you'll get this message.
Professor Brand's assured me he'll get it to you.

715
00:53:50,687 --> 00:53:52,731
Know that I love you.

716
00:53:54,149 --> 00:53:56,484
- Is it him?
- I don't think so, Murph.

717
00:54:03,366 --> 00:54:05,034
You must be Donald.

718
00:54:07,245 --> 00:54:08,413
Hello, Murph.

719
00:54:09,164 --> 00:54:11,166
Why are you in my dad's truck?

720
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:13,960
He wanted me to bring it for your brother.

721
00:54:14,711 --> 00:54:16,880
He sent you a message.

722
00:54:19,966 --> 00:54:21,968
She's pretty upset with him for leaving.

723
00:54:22,135 --> 00:54:26,222
If you record any messages,
I can get them to transmit it to Cooper.

724
00:54:27,307 --> 00:54:29,976
Murph is a bright spark.

725
00:54:30,977 --> 00:54:33,521
Maybe I should fan the flame.

726
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:36,274
She's already making fools of her teachers.

727
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:39,277
So maybe she should come
and make a fool out of you.

728
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:43,198
- So where are they?
- Heading for Mars.

729
00:54:43,907 --> 00:54:47,911
The next time you hear from Cooper,
they'll be coming up on Saturn.

730
00:55:27,867 --> 00:55:29,577
As far as school goes...

731
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:32,914
...the administration wants me
to repeat Plant Pathology. Which sucks.

732
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:36,626
But they said I could start
Advanced Agriculture a year early.

733
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:42,298
All right, I got to go, Dad.
Hope you're safe up there.

734
00:55:46,344 --> 00:55:47,929
Um, sorry, Coop.

735
00:55:48,096 --> 00:55:52,934
I asked Murph to say hi,
but she's as stubborn as her old man.

736
00:55:53,351 --> 00:55:55,186
I'll try again next time.

737
00:56:10,201 --> 00:56:11,786
You all right, Rom?

738
00:56:14,122 --> 00:56:15,957
This gets to me, Cooper.

739
00:56:16,124 --> 00:56:17,792
This. This.

740
00:56:18,293 --> 00:56:21,170
Millimeters of aluminum, that's it,
and then nothing...

741
00:56:21,337 --> 00:56:25,300
...out there for millions of miles
won't kill us in seconds.

742
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:28,136
You know that some of the finest...

743
00:56:28,303 --> 00:56:32,140
...solo yachtsmen in the world
don't know how to swim?

744
00:56:32,724 --> 00:56:35,894
They don't know how.
And if they go overboard, psst, they're done.

745
00:56:37,645 --> 00:56:39,606
We're explorers, Rom.

746
00:56:41,149 --> 00:56:42,859
This is our boat.

747
00:56:43,026 --> 00:56:44,152
Here.

748
00:57:11,262 --> 00:57:13,014
This is from the, uh, relay probe?

749
00:57:13,181 --> 00:57:15,224
It was in orbit around the Wormhole.

750
00:57:15,725 --> 00:57:18,770
This is the Wormhole,
and every time we'd come around...

751
00:57:18,937 --> 00:57:22,148
...we would receive images
from the other side of the foreign galaxy.

752
00:57:22,482 --> 00:57:24,609
Oh, yeah. Like swinging a periscope around.

753
00:57:24,776 --> 00:57:25,860
Exactly.

754
00:57:26,027 --> 00:57:30,531
So we got a pretty good idea
what we're gonna find on the other side, huh?

755
00:57:31,616 --> 00:57:32,951
Navigationally.

756
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:38,164
Guys? We'll be approaching
the Wormhole in about three hours.

757
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:45,588
Hey, Coop?

758
00:57:46,464 --> 00:57:48,216
Can we stop the spinning?

759
00:57:48,383 --> 00:57:49,467
Why?

760
00:57:49,634 --> 00:57:51,970
Because we're close enough to see it now?

761
00:57:53,805 --> 00:57:54,931
All right.

762
00:57:55,098 --> 00:57:56,182
Thanks.

763
00:58:01,938 --> 00:58:03,898
There, that's it! That's the Wormhole!

764
00:58:04,065 --> 00:58:05,858
Say it, don't spray it, Rom.

765
00:58:06,234 --> 00:58:07,527
It's a sphere.

766
00:58:07,694 --> 00:58:11,656
Of course it is. What, you...?
You thought it would just be a hole?

767
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:15,952
No, it's just that all the illustrations
I've ever seen, they...

768
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:19,580
In the illustrations,
they're trying to show you how it works.

769
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:24,127
So they say you want to go
from here to there.

770
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:27,005
- But it's too far, right?
- Mm-hm.

771
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:31,968
So a Wormhole bends space like this,
so you can take a shortcut through...

772
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:33,886
...a higher dimension.

773
00:58:34,053 --> 00:58:35,513
Okay, so...

774
00:58:35,847 --> 00:58:39,767
...to show that, they've turned
three-dimensional space into two dimensions...

775
00:58:39,934 --> 00:58:43,896
...which turns a Wormhole
into two dimensions, a circle.

776
00:58:44,063 --> 00:58:46,315
What's a circle in three dimensions?

777
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:49,027
- A sphere.
- Exactly.

778
00:58:49,444 --> 00:58:50,945
A spherical hole.

779
00:58:51,487 --> 00:58:54,323
But who put it there?
Who do we have to thank?

780
00:58:54,741 --> 00:58:59,412
I'm not thanking anybody
until we get out of here in one piece, Rom.

781
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:08,046
Any trick to this, Doyle?

782
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,049
No one knows.

783
00:59:18,181 --> 00:59:19,849
The others made it, right?

784
00:59:21,893 --> 00:59:23,561
At least some of them.

785
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:58,679
Everybody ready to say goodbye
to our solar system?

786
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:01,557
To our galaxy.

787
01:00:03,476 --> 01:00:04,519
Here we go.

788
01:00:37,135 --> 01:00:40,638
The controls won't work here.
We're passing through the bulk.

789
01:00:40,805 --> 01:00:45,226
It's space beyond our three dimensions.
All you can do is record and observe.

790
01:00:56,404 --> 01:00:57,446
What is that?

791
01:00:59,824 --> 01:01:01,659
I think it's them.

792
01:01:01,993 --> 01:01:03,828
Distorting space-time.

793
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:06,998
Don't! Don't!

794
01:01:35,026 --> 01:01:36,277
What was that?

795
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,781
The first handshake.

796
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:43,492
We're...

797
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,454
We're here.

798
01:02:06,807 --> 01:02:09,060
So the lost communications came through.

799
01:02:09,227 --> 01:02:12,104
- How?
- The relay on this side cached them.

800
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:15,816
So years of basic data. No real surprises.

801
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:20,571
Miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up,
as has Dr. Mann's. Um...

802
01:02:20,738 --> 01:02:22,865
Edmunds' went down three years ago.

803
01:02:23,032 --> 01:02:24,242
Transmitter failure?

804
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:27,411
Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up
right until it went dark.

805
01:02:27,578 --> 01:02:29,338
But Miller's still looks good though, right?

806
01:02:29,497 --> 01:02:31,791
- Because she's coming up fast.
- Mm-hm.

807
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:34,252
With one complication.

808
01:02:34,669 --> 01:02:37,672
The planet is much closer to Gargantua
than we thought.

809
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:40,508
- Gargantua?
- It's what we're calling the black hole.

810
01:02:40,675 --> 01:02:42,969
Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets
both orbit it.

811
01:02:43,135 --> 01:02:46,347
- And Miller's is on the horizon?
- As a basketball around a hoop.

812
01:02:46,514 --> 01:02:48,516
Landing there takes us dangerously close.

813
01:02:48,683 --> 01:02:51,936
And a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull.

814
01:02:54,522 --> 01:02:57,525
Look, I could swing around that neutron star
to decelerate.

815
01:02:57,692 --> 01:02:59,568
No, it's not that. It's time.

816
01:02:59,735 --> 01:03:04,240
The gravity on that planet will slow our clock
compared to Earth's drastically.

817
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:06,033
How bad?

818
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,745
Every hour we spend
on that planet will be...

819
01:03:10,621 --> 01:03:12,790
...seven years back on Earth.

820
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:14,709
Jesus.

821
01:03:15,042 --> 01:03:16,711
Well, that's relativity, folks.

822
01:03:18,129 --> 01:03:20,589
Well, we can't just drop down
there without...

823
01:03:20,756 --> 01:03:22,633
Cooper, we have a mission.

824
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,386
Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission,
and our mission Plan A is...

825
01:03:25,553 --> 01:03:28,723
...to find a planet that can habitate
the people that are living on Earth now.

826
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:31,726
You can't just think about your family.
Now you have to think bigger.

827
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:35,104
I am thinking about my family
and millions of other families, okay?

828
01:03:35,271 --> 01:03:39,525
Plan A does not work if the people on Earth
are dead by the time we pull it off.

829
01:03:40,818 --> 01:03:42,486
No. It doesn't.

830
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,488
That's why there's a Plan B.

831
01:03:46,407 --> 01:03:47,908
Okay. Cooper's right.

832
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:51,912
We need to think of time as a resource,
like oxygen and food. Going down will cost us.

833
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:55,458
All right, look.

834
01:03:56,751 --> 01:04:00,212
Dr. Mann's data is promising,
but it will take months to get there.

835
01:04:00,379 --> 01:04:02,590
And Edmunds', it's even further.

836
01:04:02,757 --> 01:04:06,927
Miller hasn't sent much, but what she has
is very promising. It's water, it's organics...

837
01:04:07,094 --> 01:04:09,263
- You don't find that every day.
- No, you don't.

838
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:11,766
And just think about the resources,
including time...

839
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:14,435
...that would be spent
trying to get back here.

840
01:04:15,561 --> 01:04:17,355
- Romilly...
- Yeah?

841
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:21,359
...how far off from Miller's planet do we have
to be to stay out of the time shift?

842
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:23,194
Just back from the cusp.

843
01:04:23,361 --> 01:04:26,322
All right, which is here,
just outside of Miller's planet.

844
01:04:26,489 --> 01:04:28,282
- Right.
- Okay.

845
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,994
Here's Gargantua. Here's Miller's planet.

846
01:04:32,161 --> 01:04:35,331
Instead of taking the Endurance into orbit
around Miller's planet...

847
01:04:35,498 --> 01:04:38,376
...which would conserve fuel,
but we would lose a lot of time...

848
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:42,630
...what if we take a wider orbit around
Gargantua, parallel with Miller's planet...

849
01:04:42,797 --> 01:04:45,299
...outside of this time shift, to here?

850
01:04:45,466 --> 01:04:48,260
Then we take the Ranger down,
we get Miller, we get her samples.

851
01:04:48,427 --> 01:04:51,138
We come back, we analyze, we debrief.
We're in, we're out.

852
01:04:51,305 --> 01:04:53,641
We lose a little fuel,
but we save a whole lot of time.

853
01:04:53,808 --> 01:04:55,643
- That'll work.
- That's good.

854
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:58,270
There's no time for monkey business
or chit-chat down there.

855
01:04:58,437 --> 01:05:01,232
So, TARS, you should definitely stay here.

856
01:05:01,399 --> 01:05:03,651
CASE, you're with me. Anyone else can stay.

857
01:05:03,818 --> 01:05:07,405
If we're talking about a couple years,
I could use the time to research gravity.

858
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:10,533
Observations from the Wormhole,
that's gold to Professor Brand.

859
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:12,368
TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua.

860
01:05:12,535 --> 01:05:17,289
Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting,
but make sure we stay in range of Miller's planet.

861
01:05:17,456 --> 01:05:21,210
- You got it?
- I wouldn't leave you behind, Dr. Brand.

862
01:05:25,881 --> 01:05:27,508
- You ready, CASE?
- Yup.

863
01:05:28,467 --> 01:05:31,971
- You don't say much, do you?
- TARS talks plenty for both of us.

864
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:34,223
Detach.

865
01:05:41,522 --> 01:05:44,483
- Romilly, are you reading these forces?
- It's unbelievable.

866
01:05:47,695 --> 01:05:49,822
A literal heart of darkness.

867
01:05:53,993 --> 01:05:56,704
If we could just see
the collapsed star inside...

868
01:05:56,871 --> 01:05:59,623
...the singularity,
yeah, we'd solve gravity.

869
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:03,335
- And we can't get anything from it?
- Nothing escapes that horizon.

870
01:06:03,502 --> 01:06:04,837
Not even light.

871
01:06:05,004 --> 01:06:08,507
- The answer's there, just no way to see it.
- There's Miller's planet.

872
01:06:11,177 --> 01:06:12,511
Goodbye, Ranger.

873
01:06:25,316 --> 01:06:27,610
This is fast for atmospheric entry.

874
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:30,029
- Should we use the thrusters to slow?
- No.

875
01:06:30,488 --> 01:06:33,824
I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics
to save some fuel.

876
01:06:33,991 --> 01:06:35,201
Air brake?

877
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:38,913
- We want to get down fast, don't we?
- We want to get there in one piece.

878
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:42,082
- Hang on.
- Brand, Doyle, get ready.

879
01:06:57,932 --> 01:07:00,434
- We should ease!
- Hands where I can see them.

880
01:07:00,601 --> 01:07:03,938
The only time I went down was
when a machine was easing at the wrong time.

881
01:07:04,104 --> 01:07:06,941
- A little caution...
- Can get you killed, like reckless driving.

882
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:09,276
- Cooper, it's too damn fast!
- I got this.

883
01:07:14,114 --> 01:07:18,118
- Should I disable the feedback?
- No. I need to feel the air.

884
01:07:22,122 --> 01:07:23,290
Here we go.

885
01:07:26,585 --> 01:07:27,878
It's just water!

886
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:30,881
The stuff of life.

887
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:32,758
Twelve hundred meters.

888
01:07:32,925 --> 01:07:34,969
- Do we have a fix on the beacon?
- Got it!

889
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:37,763
- Can you maneuver?
- I'll need to shave some speed.

890
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:40,558
I'm gonna spiral down on top of it.
Everybody hang on!

891
01:07:42,977 --> 01:07:44,019
Seven hundred.

892
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:48,148
On my cue, CASE. On my cue.

893
01:07:51,652 --> 01:07:53,153
Five hundred meters.

894
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:03,664
Fire!

895
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:18,304
Very graceful.

896
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:19,555
No.

897
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:22,266
But very efficient.

898
01:08:24,727 --> 01:08:26,937
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

899
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:29,023
Go, go, go!

900
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:32,693
Seven years per hour here.
Let's make it count!

901
01:08:58,802 --> 01:09:00,054
This way.

902
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:04,642
About 200 meters.

903
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:15,778
The gravity's punishing.

904
01:09:16,737 --> 01:09:18,864
Been floating through space too long?

905
01:09:19,031 --> 01:09:21,075
One hundred and thirty percent
Earth gravity.

906
01:09:21,408 --> 01:09:23,410
Come on. Come on.

907
01:09:26,038 --> 01:09:28,874
- There's nothing here.
- Should be right here.

908
01:09:30,793 --> 01:09:33,796
If the signal's coming from here, then...

909
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:44,598
Her beacon.

910
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:53,774
Wreckage.

911
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:55,609
Where's the rest?

912
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:57,611
Towards the mountains!

913
01:10:01,448 --> 01:10:03,283
Those aren't mountains.

914
01:10:04,952 --> 01:10:06,286
They're waves.

915
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:14,294
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

916
01:10:14,795 --> 01:10:16,797
That one's moving away from us.

917
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:24,972
We need the recorder.

918
01:10:35,149 --> 01:10:37,401
Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!

919
01:10:37,568 --> 01:10:40,946
We're not leaving without her data.

920
01:10:41,113 --> 01:10:42,448
Get back here now!

921
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:44,324
We do not have time!

922
01:10:44,491 --> 01:10:46,952
The second wave is coming!
We're in the middle of a swell.

923
01:10:48,245 --> 01:10:49,663
No, I got it.

924
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:51,832
Get your ass back to the Ranger now!

925
01:10:56,837 --> 01:10:58,881
Brand, get back here now!

926
01:11:00,841 --> 01:11:03,051
No, Cooper, go. Cooper, go.
I can't make it.

927
01:11:03,469 --> 01:11:05,846
- Go!
- CASE, go get her.

928
01:11:10,642 --> 01:11:12,644
- Go!
- Get up. Get up, Brand!

929
01:11:13,562 --> 01:11:15,063
Go, go! Go!

930
01:11:16,648 --> 01:11:19,485
- I'm not gonna make it!
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are!

931
01:11:26,325 --> 01:11:28,619
Come on, CASE has her!
Get back here, Doyle!

932
01:11:31,622 --> 01:11:32,706
Come on!

933
01:11:35,459 --> 01:11:36,877
Get to the hatch!

934
01:11:41,423 --> 01:11:42,925
Go, go! Go!

935
01:11:48,472 --> 01:11:49,556
Shit.

936
01:11:50,057 --> 01:11:51,892
Manually overriding inside hatch!

937
01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:56,563
Cooper! Wait!

938
01:12:03,904 --> 01:12:07,574
The engines are flooded!
I'm gonna have to shut her down.

939
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:42,359
Holy shit.

940
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:48,115
Hang on!

941
01:13:19,354 --> 01:13:20,606
CASE, what's the problem?

942
01:13:20,772 --> 01:13:23,191
Too waterlogged. Let it drain.

943
01:13:24,318 --> 01:13:25,527
Goddamn it!

944
01:13:25,694 --> 01:13:30,365
- I told you to leave me! Why didn't you?
- And I told you to get your ass back here!

945
01:13:30,532 --> 01:13:35,203
- One of us was thinking about the mission!
- You were thinking about getting home.

946
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:39,374
I was trying to do the right thing!

947
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:41,501
Can you tell that to Doyle?

948
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:45,964
- CASE, how much time?
- Forty-five to an hour.

949
01:13:47,758 --> 01:13:49,092
The stuff of life, huh?

950
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:52,179
What's this gonna cost us, Brand?

951
01:13:52,346 --> 01:13:54,306
A lot. Decades.

952
01:14:01,521 --> 01:14:02,856
What happened to Miller?

953
01:14:03,607 --> 01:14:06,360
Judging by the wreckage, she was...

954
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:09,154
...broken up by a wave soon after impact.

955
01:14:09,321 --> 01:14:12,157
How's the wreckage stayed together
after all these years, huh?

956
01:14:13,408 --> 01:14:15,410
Because of the time slippage.

957
01:14:16,536 --> 01:14:21,041
On this planet's time,
she just landed hours ago.

958
01:14:21,959 --> 01:14:24,336
She probably just died minutes ago.

959
01:14:24,503 --> 01:14:28,548
The data Doyle received was just
the initial status echoing endlessly.

960
01:14:28,924 --> 01:14:31,093
Oh, we are not prepared for this.

961
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:36,932
You eggheads have the survival skills
of a Boy Scout troop.

962
01:14:37,099 --> 01:14:40,352
Well, we got this far on our brains.
Farther than any human in history.

963
01:14:40,519 --> 01:14:42,104
Well, not far enough!

964
01:14:42,437 --> 01:14:45,941
And now we're stuck here till there won't be
anyone left on Earth to save.

965
01:14:48,986 --> 01:14:51,655
I'm counting every minute,
same as you, Cooper.

966
01:14:56,451 --> 01:14:58,286
Is there any possibility...

967
01:14:58,453 --> 01:15:02,082
...some kind of a way
we can maybe all jump in a black hole?

968
01:15:02,249 --> 01:15:03,917
Gain back the years?

969
01:15:04,584 --> 01:15:06,086
Don't shake your head at me.

970
01:15:06,253 --> 01:15:08,255
Time is relative, okay?

971
01:15:08,422 --> 01:15:11,466
It can stretch and it can squeeze, but...

972
01:15:11,967 --> 01:15:14,177
...it can't run backwards. Lt just can't.

973
01:15:14,344 --> 01:15:18,765
The only thing that can move across
dimensions, like time, is gravity.

974
01:15:21,476 --> 01:15:22,644
Okay.

975
01:15:24,604 --> 01:15:28,483
The beings that led us here,
they communicate...

976
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:30,485
...through gravity, right?
- Yes.

977
01:15:30,652 --> 01:15:32,821
Could they be talking to us
from the future?

978
01:15:33,739 --> 01:15:35,991
- Maybe.
- Okay. If they can...

979
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:40,454
"They" are beings of five dimensions.

980
01:15:40,871 --> 01:15:44,207
To them, time might be
another physical dimension.

981
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:45,876
To them...

982
01:15:46,293 --> 01:15:50,464
...the past might be a canyon
that they can climb into and the future...

983
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:53,633
...a mountain they can climb up.
But to us, it's not, okay?

984
01:15:54,718 --> 01:15:57,137
Look, Cooper, I screwed up. I'm sorry.

985
01:15:59,306 --> 01:16:01,058
But you knew about relativity.

986
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:02,559
Oh.

987
01:16:04,269 --> 01:16:05,437
Brand...

988
01:16:10,317 --> 01:16:12,235
...my daughter was 10 years old.

989
01:16:12,861 --> 01:16:15,655
I couldn't teach her
Einstein's theories before I left.

990
01:16:16,073 --> 01:16:18,909
Couldn't you have told her
you were going to save the world?

991
01:16:19,493 --> 01:16:20,535
No.

992
01:16:22,204 --> 01:16:26,374
When you become a parent,
one thing becomes really clear.

993
01:16:27,876 --> 01:16:31,046
And that is that you want to make sure
your children feel safe.

994
01:16:32,089 --> 01:16:35,842
And it rules out telling a 10-year-old
that the world is ending.

995
01:16:38,303 --> 01:16:39,679
Cooper?

996
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:45,894
- How long for the engines, CASE?
- A minute or two.

997
01:16:46,061 --> 01:16:48,146
We don't have it. Helmets on!

998
01:16:52,067 --> 01:16:53,860
Brand, co-pilot, you're up.

999
01:16:54,027 --> 01:16:56,530
CASE, blow the cabin oxygen
through the main thrusters!

1000
01:16:56,696 --> 01:16:58,406
- We're gonna spark it.
- Roger that.

1001
01:16:58,698 --> 01:17:00,033
- Locked.
- Depressurizing.

1002
01:17:05,914 --> 01:17:07,165
Engines up!

1003
01:17:36,027 --> 01:17:37,529
Hello, Rom.

1004
01:17:37,988 --> 01:17:39,656
I've waited years.

1005
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,576
How...? How many years?

1006
01:17:44,411 --> 01:17:47,372
- By now it must be...
- Twenty-three years...

1007
01:17:47,539 --> 01:17:49,249
...four months, eight days.

1008
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:54,838
Doyle?

1009
01:18:01,052 --> 01:18:04,055
I thought I was prepared.
I knew the theory.

1010
01:18:05,432 --> 01:18:06,933
Reality's different.

1011
01:18:07,976 --> 01:18:09,144
And Miller?

1012
01:18:10,729 --> 01:18:12,731
There's nothing here for us.

1013
01:18:15,483 --> 01:18:16,985
Why didn't you sleep?

1014
01:18:17,944 --> 01:18:22,032
Oh, I had a couple of stretches.
But I stopped believing you were coming back.

1015
01:18:22,532 --> 01:18:25,535
And something seemed wrong
about dreaming my life away.

1016
01:18:26,369 --> 01:18:29,206
I learned what I could
from the black hole...

1017
01:18:29,581 --> 01:18:32,042
...but I couldn't send anything
to your father.

1018
01:18:32,209 --> 01:18:34,461
We've been receiving, but nothing gets out.

1019
01:18:34,628 --> 01:18:36,713
- Is he alive?
- Oh, yeah.

1020
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:38,924
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1021
01:18:41,927 --> 01:18:44,930
We've got years of messages stored.

1022
01:18:45,222 --> 01:18:46,389
Cooper.

1023
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:49,559
Messages span 23 years.

1024
01:18:51,603 --> 01:18:53,271
Play it from the beginning.

1025
01:18:56,316 --> 01:18:58,026
Hey, Dad.

1026
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:01,279
Checking in. Saying hi.

1027
01:19:02,364 --> 01:19:03,865
Um...

1028
01:19:04,032 --> 01:19:05,825
Finished second in school.

1029
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,829
Miss Kurling's still giving me C's though.

1030
01:19:10,121 --> 01:19:12,958
Pulled me down, but seconds not bad.

1031
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:16,294
Grandpa attended the ceremony.

1032
01:19:17,921 --> 01:19:19,923
Um... Oh.

1033
01:19:20,882 --> 01:19:22,842
I met another girl, Dad.

1034
01:19:23,009 --> 01:19:24,594
I, uh...

1035
01:19:25,345 --> 01:19:27,347
I really think this is the one.

1036
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:31,226
Name's Lois. That's her right there.

1037
01:19:34,271 --> 01:19:36,273
Murphy stole Grandpa's car.

1038
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:39,609
She crashed it. She's okay, though.

1039
01:19:40,277 --> 01:19:41,361
Hey, Dad.

1040
01:19:42,279 --> 01:19:43,613
Look at this!

1041
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:45,949
You're a grandpa.

1042
01:19:47,367 --> 01:19:49,035
His name's Jesse.

1043
01:19:49,703 --> 01:19:54,291
I kind of wanted to call him Coop,
but Lois says, uh, maybe next time.

1044
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:59,379
Donald says he's already earned
the "great" part, so we just leave it at that.

1045
01:20:02,549 --> 01:20:04,342
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

1046
01:20:05,135 --> 01:20:06,761
Say "Bye-bye, Grandpa."

1047
01:20:07,137 --> 01:20:08,972
Bye-bye, Grandpa. Okay.

1048
01:20:09,389 --> 01:20:11,891
Sorry it's been a while.

1049
01:20:13,268 --> 01:20:14,311
Just...

1050
01:20:16,521 --> 01:20:18,523
...what with Jesse and all.

1051
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:23,403
Uh...

1052
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:27,365
Grandpa died last week.

1053
01:20:27,782 --> 01:20:32,829
We buried him out in the back forty
next to Mom and Jesse.

1054
01:20:33,705 --> 01:20:39,044
Which is where we would have buried
you if you'd ever come back.

1055
01:20:40,545 --> 01:20:42,797
Murph was there at the funeral.

1056
01:20:43,423 --> 01:20:46,176
We don't see her that much,
but she came for that.

1057
01:20:49,387 --> 01:20:51,806
You aren't listening to this, I know that.

1058
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:57,687
All these messages are just, like...

1059
01:20:58,855 --> 01:21:02,525
...drifting out there in the darkness.

1060
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:05,945
Lois says that, uh...

1061
01:21:06,738 --> 01:21:09,491
...I have to let you go.

1062
01:21:09,866 --> 01:21:11,701
And, uh...

1063
01:21:12,202 --> 01:21:13,286
...so...

1064
01:21:16,539 --> 01:21:19,626
...I guess I'm letting you go.

1065
01:21:20,585 --> 01:21:23,254
I don't know where you are, Dad...

1066
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:26,508
...but I hope that you're at peace.

1067
01:21:28,301 --> 01:21:29,386
Goodbye.

1068
01:21:42,982 --> 01:21:44,234
Hey, Dad.

1069
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:48,238
Hey, Murph.

1070
01:21:48,405 --> 01:21:50,323
You son of a bitch.

1071
01:21:54,035 --> 01:21:56,538
I never made one of these
when you were still responding...

1072
01:21:56,704 --> 01:21:59,040
...because I was so mad at you for leaving.

1073
01:22:02,085 --> 01:22:04,170
And then when you went quiet, it...

1074
01:22:06,798 --> 01:22:09,634
...seemed like I should live
with that decision. And I have.

1075
01:22:14,139 --> 01:22:16,558
But today's my birthday.

1076
01:22:20,228 --> 01:22:23,398
And it's a special one,
because you told me...

1077
01:22:27,527 --> 01:22:31,865
You once told me that when you came back,
we might be the same age.

1078
01:22:33,575 --> 01:22:36,661
And today I'm the age you were
when you left.

1079
01:22:39,664 --> 01:22:41,749
So it would be a real good time
for you to come back.

1080
01:22:56,222 --> 01:23:00,518
I didn't mean to intrude. It's just that
I've never seen you in here before.

1081
01:23:01,144 --> 01:23:03,313
I've never been in here before.

1082
01:23:05,190 --> 01:23:08,193
I talk to Amelia all the time.

1083
01:23:08,693 --> 01:23:10,028
It helps.

1084
01:23:10,695 --> 01:23:13,448
- I'm glad you've started.
- I haven't. I...

1085
01:23:13,615 --> 01:23:16,117
I just had something I needed to get out.

1086
01:23:16,451 --> 01:23:18,870
- I know they're still out there.
- I know.

1087
01:23:19,037 --> 01:23:23,249
There are so many reasons their
communications might not be getting through.

1088
01:23:23,416 --> 01:23:24,834
I know, professor.

1089
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:28,379
I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of.

1090
01:23:29,547 --> 01:23:31,883
Them never coming back or...

1091
01:23:33,092 --> 01:23:36,304
...coming back to find we've failed.

1092
01:23:36,471 --> 01:23:37,889
Then let's succeed.

1093
01:23:38,932 --> 01:23:39,974
So...

1094
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:44,687
...back to the fourth iteration.
Let's run it through some new fields.

1095
01:23:45,021 --> 01:23:48,191
With respect, professor,
we've tried that hundreds of times.

1096
01:23:48,525 --> 01:23:52,195
It only has to work once, Murph.

1097
01:23:55,490 --> 01:23:59,369
Every rivet that they strike
could have been a bullet.

1098
01:23:59,536 --> 01:24:01,538
We've done well for the world here...

1099
01:24:01,704 --> 01:24:06,459
...whether or not we crack the equation
before I kick the bucket.

1100
01:24:06,626 --> 01:24:09,504
- Don't be morbid, professor.
- I'm not afraid of death.

1101
01:24:10,255 --> 01:24:12,090
I'm an old physicist.

1102
01:24:13,341 --> 01:24:15,009
I'm afraid of time.

1103
01:24:22,183 --> 01:24:23,351
Time.

1104
01:24:25,395 --> 01:24:27,063
You're afraid of time.

1105
01:24:29,649 --> 01:24:31,651
We've been trying to solve the equation...

1106
01:24:31,818 --> 01:24:34,320
...without changing
the underlying assumption about time.

1107
01:24:34,487 --> 01:24:36,197
- And?
- And that means...

1108
01:24:36,364 --> 01:24:40,827
...each iteration is an attempt
to prove its own proof.

1109
01:24:40,994 --> 01:24:43,121
It's recursive. It's nonsensical.

1110
01:24:43,413 --> 01:24:45,331
Are you calling my life's work...

1111
01:24:45,498 --> 01:24:47,208
...nonsense, Murph?

1112
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:49,419
No, I'm saying that you've been
trying to...

1113
01:24:49,586 --> 01:24:53,381
...finish it with one arm... No, with
both arms. Tied behind your back.

1114
01:24:55,466 --> 01:24:57,468
And I don't understand why.

1115
01:24:58,428 --> 01:25:00,263
I'm an old man, Murph.

1116
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:03,808
Can we take this point up at another time?

1117
01:25:03,975 --> 01:25:06,102
I want to talk to my daughter.

1118
01:25:08,271 --> 01:25:10,732
Stepping out into the universe...

1119
01:25:10,898 --> 01:25:14,694
...we must confront the reality
of interstellar travel.

1120
01:25:15,612 --> 01:25:20,158
We must reach far beyond
our own lifespans.

1121
01:25:20,325 --> 01:25:25,455
We must think not as individuals
but as a species.

1122
01:25:28,291 --> 01:25:30,918
Do not go gentle into that good night

1123
01:25:33,087 --> 01:25:35,673
TARS kept the Endurance
right where we needed her.

1124
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:38,635
But the trip took years longer
than we anticipated.

1125
01:25:38,968 --> 01:25:42,472
We no longer have the fuel
to visit both prospects, so...

1126
01:25:42,805 --> 01:25:44,307
...we have to choose.

1127
01:25:45,516 --> 01:25:46,643
But how?

1128
01:25:47,685 --> 01:25:49,354
They're both promising.

1129
01:25:50,897 --> 01:25:55,401
Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann
is the one still transmitting, so...

1130
01:25:55,568 --> 01:25:58,488
We've no reason to suspect
Edmunds's data would have soured.

1131
01:25:59,405 --> 01:26:01,908
His world has key elements
to sustain human life.

1132
01:26:02,075 --> 01:26:05,244
- As does Dr. Mann's.
- Cooper, this is my field.

1133
01:26:06,412 --> 01:26:07,455
And...

1134
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:10,416
...I really believe Edmunds'
is the better prospect.

1135
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:13,920
- Why?
- Gargantua, that's why.

1136
01:26:15,046 --> 01:26:19,092
Look at Miller's planet.
Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...

1137
01:26:19,258 --> 01:26:23,680
...but no life. Sterile.
We'll find the same thing on Mann's.

1138
01:26:24,097 --> 01:26:25,765
Because of the black hole?

1139
01:26:26,057 --> 01:26:29,102
Murphy's Law.
Whatever can happen will happen.

1140
01:26:29,268 --> 01:26:31,604
Accident is the first building block
of evolution.

1141
01:26:31,771 --> 01:26:34,607
But when you're orbiting a black hole
not enough can happen.

1142
01:26:34,774 --> 01:26:39,070
It sucks in asteroids and comets,
other events which would otherwise reach you.

1143
01:26:39,445 --> 01:26:41,280
We need to go further afield.

1144
01:26:41,906 --> 01:26:44,242
You once said that Dr. Mann...

1145
01:26:45,493 --> 01:26:46,994
...was the best of us.

1146
01:26:47,286 --> 01:26:50,456
He's remarkable.
We're only here because of him.

1147
01:26:50,998 --> 01:26:52,834
And yet... Yet here he is.

1148
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,964
He's on the ground, and he's sending
a very unambiguous message, telling us...

1149
01:26:58,131 --> 01:26:59,841
...to come to his planet.

1150
01:27:00,007 --> 01:27:04,637
Granted, but Edmunds' data
is more promising.

1151
01:27:05,096 --> 01:27:06,139
We should vote.

1152
01:27:06,305 --> 01:27:08,474
Well, if we vote,
there's something you should know.

1153
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:10,643
Brand?

1154
01:27:10,810 --> 01:27:12,478
He has a right to know.

1155
01:27:12,979 --> 01:27:14,731
That has nothing to do with it.

1156
01:27:14,897 --> 01:27:17,942
- What does?
- She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.

1157
01:27:18,109 --> 01:27:20,653
- Is that true?
- Yes.

1158
01:27:23,823 --> 01:27:26,534
And that makes me want to follow my heart.

1159
01:27:29,996 --> 01:27:33,666
But maybe we've spent too long
trying to figure all this outwith theory.

1160
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:35,251
You're a scientist, Brand.

1161
01:27:35,418 --> 01:27:36,961
So listen to me...

1162
01:27:37,795 --> 01:27:42,508
...when I say that love
isn't something we invented. It's...

1163
01:27:43,509 --> 01:27:45,845
...observable, powerful.

1164
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:49,640
It has to mean something.

1165
01:27:49,807 --> 01:27:54,187
Love has meaning, yes.
Social utility, social bonding, child rearing...

1166
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:57,857
We love people who have died.
Where's the social utility in that?

1167
01:27:58,399 --> 01:27:59,442
None.

1168
01:27:59,609 --> 01:28:03,488
Maybe it means something more,
something we can't...

1169
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:05,698
...yet understand.

1170
01:28:05,865 --> 01:28:09,327
Maybe it's some evidence, some...

1171
01:28:10,286 --> 01:28:14,749
...artifact of a higher dimension
that we can't consciously perceive.

1172
01:28:14,916 --> 01:28:19,712
I'm drawn across the universe
to someone I haven't seen in a decade...

1173
01:28:19,879 --> 01:28:22,715
...who I know is probably dead.

1174
01:28:23,049 --> 01:28:26,385
Love is the one thing
we're capable of perceiving...

1175
01:28:26,552 --> 01:28:29,388
...that transcends dimensions
of time and space.

1176
01:28:31,224 --> 01:28:35,561
Maybe we should trust that,
even if we can't understand it yet.

1177
01:28:40,566 --> 01:28:42,235
All right, Cooper...

1178
01:28:44,111 --> 01:28:45,404
...yes...

1179
01:28:46,572 --> 01:28:49,909
...the tiniest possibility
of seeing Wolf again excites me.

1180
01:28:50,743 --> 01:28:52,411
That doesn't mean I'm wrong.

1181
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,289
Honestly, Amelia...

1182
01:28:57,083 --> 01:28:58,251
...it might.

1183
01:29:05,049 --> 01:29:07,760
TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's.

1184
01:29:24,652 --> 01:29:26,112
We'll lose about a third again.

1185
01:29:26,279 --> 01:29:27,822
But next year...

1186
01:29:30,116 --> 01:29:32,952
Next year I'm gonna work Nelson's farm
and we'll make it up.

1187
01:29:33,786 --> 01:29:35,621
What happened to Nelson?

1188
01:29:41,544 --> 01:29:43,754
Murph, would you like some more souffle?

1189
01:29:43,921 --> 01:29:47,300
Oh, no. I'm full, thanks. It was delicious.

1190
01:29:48,175 --> 01:29:50,177
Coop, finish your fritter, please.

1191
01:29:52,346 --> 01:29:56,058
Will you spend the night?
Your room is exactly as you left it. It's ready.

1192
01:29:56,225 --> 01:29:57,602
I need to get back.

1193
01:29:57,768 --> 01:30:00,313
My sewing machine is in there,
but there's plenty...

1194
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:01,772
I need to...

1195
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:06,193
Too many memories.

1196
01:30:06,819 --> 01:30:09,614
We might have something for that.
Hey, Coop.

1197
01:30:17,163 --> 01:30:18,456
The dust.

1198
01:30:20,958 --> 01:30:23,336
Lois, I have a friend who...

1199
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:25,338
...could look at his lungs.

1200
01:30:43,522 --> 01:30:46,192
- Amelia, I'm sorry.
- You were just being objective.

1201
01:30:46,359 --> 01:30:49,820
Unless you're punishing me
for screwing up on Miller's planet.

1202
01:30:49,987 --> 01:30:52,239
No, this wasn't a personal decision.

1203
01:30:53,074 --> 01:30:57,119
If you're wrong, you will have
a very personal decision to make.

1204
01:30:57,286 --> 01:31:00,247
Your fuel calculations
are based on a return journey.

1205
01:31:00,581 --> 01:31:04,460
Strike out on Mann's planet, and we'll have
to decide whether to return home...

1206
01:31:04,752 --> 01:31:06,879
...or push on to Edmunds' with Plan B.

1207
01:31:07,213 --> 01:31:10,883
Starting a colony could save us
from extinction.

1208
01:31:11,217 --> 01:31:14,387
You might have to decide
between seeing your children again...

1209
01:31:14,553 --> 01:31:16,389
...and the future of the human race.

1210
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:19,600
I trust you'll be as objective then.

1211
01:31:26,482 --> 01:31:28,401
He's been asking for you since he came to.

1212
01:31:28,567 --> 01:31:30,194
We were trying to reach you.

1213
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:37,201
Murph.

1214
01:31:38,202 --> 01:31:39,704
I'm here, professor.

1215
01:31:40,413 --> 01:31:42,748
I let you all down.

1216
01:31:43,082 --> 01:31:46,419
No, you got us so far. Real close.

1217
01:31:48,254 --> 01:31:50,047
I'll finish what you started.

1218
01:31:50,214 --> 01:31:52,425
Good, good Murph.

1219
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:57,013
You had faith...

1220
01:31:58,222 --> 01:31:59,515
...all those...

1221
01:32:00,474 --> 01:32:02,268
...all those years.

1222
01:32:03,936 --> 01:32:05,187
I...

1223
01:32:05,354 --> 01:32:07,857
I asked you to have faith.

1224
01:32:09,608 --> 01:32:12,403
I wanted you to believe...

1225
01:32:13,904 --> 01:32:15,781
...that your father...

1226
01:32:18,784 --> 01:32:20,619
...would come back.

1227
01:32:20,786 --> 01:32:22,079
I do, professor.

1228
01:32:23,706 --> 01:32:25,207
Forgive me, Murph.

1229
01:32:25,958 --> 01:32:27,960
There's nothing to forgive.

1230
01:32:30,629 --> 01:32:31,672
I...

1231
01:32:32,256 --> 01:32:34,091
I lied, Murph.

1232
01:32:36,469 --> 01:32:38,262
I lied to you.

1233
01:32:44,602 --> 01:32:47,813
There was no need for him to...

1234
01:32:49,023 --> 01:32:50,900
To come back.

1235
01:32:53,486 --> 01:32:56,822
There is no way to help us.

1236
01:32:58,115 --> 01:32:59,158
But Plan A...

1237
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:02,828
All this. All these people.

1238
01:33:03,954 --> 01:33:05,748
And the equation.

1239
01:33:09,752 --> 01:33:11,504
Did my father know?

1240
01:33:15,299 --> 01:33:17,009
Did he leave me?

1241
01:33:20,971 --> 01:33:22,014
Do...

1242
01:33:23,182 --> 01:33:24,517
...not...

1243
01:33:25,476 --> 01:33:26,727
...go...

1244
01:33:27,937 --> 01:33:29,522
...gentle...

1245
01:33:31,524 --> 01:33:32,691
No.

1246
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:35,444
No!

1247
01:33:36,654 --> 01:33:38,322
You can't leave.

1248
01:33:38,697 --> 01:33:39,949
You... No.

1249
01:33:41,033 --> 01:33:45,704
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you that
your father died today. He had no pain.

1250
01:33:46,288 --> 01:33:47,957
He was at peace.

1251
01:33:48,624 --> 01:33:50,709
I'm very sorry for your loss.

1252
01:34:03,305 --> 01:34:04,974
Brand, did you know?

1253
01:34:07,393 --> 01:34:09,061
He told you, right?

1254
01:34:11,939 --> 01:34:13,315
You knew.

1255
01:34:15,234 --> 01:34:17,027
This was all a sham.

1256
01:34:21,407 --> 01:34:23,492
You left us here.

1257
01:34:25,244 --> 01:34:26,745
To suffocate.

1258
01:34:28,914 --> 01:34:30,249
To starve.

1259
01:34:57,610 --> 01:34:58,944
Frozen cloud.

1260
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:24,757
It's okay.

1261
01:37:24,923 --> 01:37:26,342
It's okay.

1262
01:37:33,182 --> 01:37:34,683
It's okay.

1263
01:37:40,105 --> 01:37:46,612
Pray you never learn just how good
it can be to see another face.

1264
01:37:55,037 --> 01:37:57,539
I hadn't a lot of hope
to begin with, but...

1265
01:37:57,706 --> 01:38:00,042
...after so long, I had none.

1266
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:04,546
My supplies were completely exhausted.

1267
01:38:06,507 --> 01:38:10,260
The last time I went to sleep,
I didn't even set a waking date.

1268
01:38:13,972 --> 01:38:16,558
You have literally raised me from the dead.

1269
01:38:17,601 --> 01:38:19,770
- Lazarus.
- Hm.

1270
01:38:20,687 --> 01:38:23,941
- What about the others?
- I'm afraid you're it, sir.

1271
01:38:24,650 --> 01:38:27,069
So far, surely.

1272
01:38:27,820 --> 01:38:32,658
No, our present situation is that there's
very little chance of rescuing any others.

1273
01:38:36,412 --> 01:38:38,622
Dr. Mann. Dr. Mann?

1274
01:38:39,498 --> 01:38:41,291
Tell us about your world.

1275
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:46,547
Our world, we hope.

1276
01:38:50,342 --> 01:38:52,678
Our world, uh, is cold...

1277
01:38:52,845 --> 01:38:54,138
...stark...

1278
01:38:56,014 --> 01:38:57,850
...but undeniably beautiful.

1279
01:39:00,102 --> 01:39:03,355
The days are 67 hours long, cold.

1280
01:39:07,359 --> 01:39:09,111
The nights are...

1281
01:39:09,278 --> 01:39:11,613
...67 far colder hours.

1282
01:39:17,453 --> 01:39:21,790
The gravity is a very, very pleasant
80 percent of the Earth's.

1283
01:39:21,957 --> 01:39:24,960
Now, up here where I landed,
the water is alkali...

1284
01:39:25,294 --> 01:39:29,047
...and the air has too much ammonia to breathe
for more than just a few minutes...

1285
01:39:29,214 --> 01:39:33,802
...but down at the surface,
and there is a surface...

1286
01:39:33,969 --> 01:39:35,596
...the chlorine dissipates.

1287
01:39:35,762 --> 01:39:39,641
The ammonia gives way to crystalline
hydrocarbons and breathable air.

1288
01:39:39,975 --> 01:39:41,477
To organics.

1289
01:39:41,810 --> 01:39:44,146
Possibly even to life.

1290
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:46,899
We might be sharing this world.

1291
01:39:47,441 --> 01:39:49,401
These readings are from the surface?

1292
01:39:49,568 --> 01:39:52,738
Over the years,
I've dropped various probes.

1293
01:39:53,071 --> 01:39:56,492
- How far have you explored?
- I've mounted several major expeditions.

1294
01:39:56,658 --> 01:40:00,913
But with oxygen in limited supply,
KIPP there really did most of the legwork.

1295
01:40:01,079 --> 01:40:03,540
- What went wrong with him, sir?
- Degeneration.

1296
01:40:03,707 --> 01:40:07,294
He misidentified the first organics
we found as ammonia crystals.

1297
01:40:07,461 --> 01:40:11,590
We struggled on for a time,
but ultimately I decommissioned him and...

1298
01:40:11,757 --> 01:40:13,926
...used his power source
to keep the mission going.

1299
01:40:14,092 --> 01:40:17,095
I thought I was alone
before I shut him down.

1300
01:40:17,262 --> 01:40:18,931
Would you like me to look at him?

1301
01:40:19,431 --> 01:40:21,600
No. No. He needs a human touch.

1302
01:40:21,767 --> 01:40:26,271
Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message
for you from the comm station.

1303
01:40:26,438 --> 01:40:28,899
Okay. Be right there. Excuse me.

1304
01:40:40,911 --> 01:40:43,497
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

1305
01:40:44,206 --> 01:40:45,832
He had no pain.

1306
01:40:48,961 --> 01:40:50,462
He was at peace.

1307
01:40:52,548 --> 01:40:54,383
I'm sorry for your loss.

1308
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:57,803
Is that Murph?

1309
01:40:58,512 --> 01:41:00,973
She's... She's grown.

1310
01:41:01,139 --> 01:41:02,724
Brand, did you know?

1311
01:41:03,892 --> 01:41:05,561
He told you, right?

1312
01:41:08,605 --> 01:41:09,898
You knew.

1313
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:13,151
This was all a sham.

1314
01:41:14,194 --> 01:41:15,862
You left us here.

1315
01:41:17,990 --> 01:41:19,491
To suffocate.

1316
01:41:21,577 --> 01:41:22,953
To starve.

1317
01:41:26,290 --> 01:41:27,874
Did my father know too?

1318
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:31,920
Dad?

1319
01:41:33,672 --> 01:41:35,591
I just want to know...

1320
01:41:36,925 --> 01:41:38,927
...if you left me here to die.

1321
01:41:41,513 --> 01:41:43,515
I just have to know.

1322
01:41:49,021 --> 01:41:50,439
Cooper, my...

1323
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:53,859
My father dedicated...

1324
01:41:54,234 --> 01:41:59,239
...his whole life to Plan A.
I have no idea what she's talking about.

1325
01:42:00,949 --> 01:42:02,117
I do.

1326
01:42:07,247 --> 01:42:09,916
He never even hoped
to get the people off the Earth?

1327
01:42:11,126 --> 01:42:12,336
No.

1328
01:42:16,381 --> 01:42:20,218
But he's been trying to solve
the gravity equation for 40 years.

1329
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:24,139
Amelia, your father solved his equation
before I even left.

1330
01:42:24,723 --> 01:42:26,600
Then why wouldn't he use it?

1331
01:42:26,767 --> 01:42:30,729
The equation couldn't reconcile relativity
with quantum mechanics. You need more.

1332
01:42:30,896 --> 01:42:32,814
More? More what?

1333
01:42:32,981 --> 01:42:35,984
More data. You need to see
into a black hole.

1334
01:42:36,151 --> 01:42:38,236
The laws of nature prohibit
a naked singularity.

1335
01:42:38,403 --> 01:42:39,905
Romilly, is that true?

1336
01:42:41,198 --> 01:42:44,910
If a black hole is an oyster,
then the singularity's the pearl inside.

1337
01:42:45,077 --> 01:42:47,829
The gravity's so strong,
it's always hidden in darkness...

1338
01:42:47,996 --> 01:42:49,414
...behind the horizon.

1339
01:42:50,832 --> 01:42:52,918
That's why we call it a black hole.

1340
01:42:53,085 --> 01:42:56,505
Okay, but if we see beyond the horizon...

1341
01:42:57,089 --> 01:42:58,590
We can't, Coop.

1342
01:42:58,757 --> 01:43:01,259
There are some things
that aren't meant to be known.

1343
01:43:01,593 --> 01:43:05,639
Your father had to find another way
to save the human race from extinction.

1344
01:43:05,806 --> 01:43:07,307
Plan B. A colony.

1345
01:43:07,474 --> 01:43:09,142
Why not tell people?

1346
01:43:10,727 --> 01:43:13,814
- Why keep building those stations?
- He knew how hard it would be...

1347
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:18,110
...to get people to work together
to save the species instead of themselves.

1348
01:43:18,276 --> 01:43:19,444
Or their children.

1349
01:43:19,611 --> 01:43:20,654
Bullshit.

1350
01:43:20,821 --> 01:43:23,615
You never would've come
unless you believed you would save them.

1351
01:43:23,782 --> 01:43:26,993
Evolution has yet to transcend
that simple barrier.

1352
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:29,621
We can care deeply, selflessly about...

1353
01:43:29,788 --> 01:43:33,291
...those we know, but that empathy
rarely extends beyond our line of sight.

1354
01:43:33,458 --> 01:43:35,168
But the lie.

1355
01:43:38,463 --> 01:43:40,882
That monstrous lie?

1356
01:43:42,134 --> 01:43:43,427
Unforgivable.

1357
01:43:43,593 --> 01:43:45,053
And he knew that.

1358
01:43:45,804 --> 01:43:50,142
He was prepared to destroy his own humanity
in order to save the species.

1359
01:43:50,308 --> 01:43:52,728
- He made an incredible sacrifice.
- No.

1360
01:43:54,146 --> 01:43:59,025
An incredible sacrifice is being made
by the people on Earth who are gonna die!

1361
01:43:59,484 --> 01:44:01,653
Because in his fucking arrogance...

1362
01:44:02,070 --> 01:44:04,156
...he declared their case hopeless.

1363
01:44:04,823 --> 01:44:06,324
I'm sorry, Cooper...

1364
01:44:06,867 --> 01:44:08,326
...their case is hopeless.

1365
01:44:08,493 --> 01:44:10,620
No. No.

1366
01:44:11,246 --> 01:44:12,748
We are the future.

1367
01:44:16,418 --> 01:44:18,336
Cooper, what can I do?

1368
01:44:21,548 --> 01:44:23,383
Let me go home.

1369
01:44:23,967 --> 01:44:25,886
You're absolutely positive?

1370
01:44:26,511 --> 01:44:29,014
His solution was correct.
He'd had it for years.

1371
01:44:29,681 --> 01:44:32,309
- It's worthless?
- It's half the answer.

1372
01:44:33,268 --> 01:44:36,271
Okay, how do you find the other half?

1373
01:44:36,855 --> 01:44:38,523
Out there? A black hole.

1374
01:44:38,690 --> 01:44:41,526
- But stuck down here on Earth?
- Yeah?

1375
01:44:42,861 --> 01:44:44,529
I'm not sure you can.

1376
01:44:46,448 --> 01:44:49,117
God, they just pack up and leave.

1377
01:44:50,535 --> 01:44:52,621
What are they hoping to find?

1378
01:44:53,205 --> 01:44:54,247
Survival.

1379
01:45:02,047 --> 01:45:03,131
Damn it.

1380
01:45:06,051 --> 01:45:09,846
Murph, don't...?
Don't people have a right to know?

1381
01:45:10,472 --> 01:45:14,559
Panic won't help.
We just have to keep working, same as ever.

1382
01:45:14,726 --> 01:45:18,063
But isn't that exactly what Professor Brand
was manipulating us to do?

1383
01:45:18,230 --> 01:45:21,483
Brand gave up on us.
I'm still trying to solve this.

1384
01:45:22,108 --> 01:45:26,279
So, do you have an idea?

1385
01:45:26,988 --> 01:45:28,323
A feeling.

1386
01:45:31,743 --> 01:45:33,745
I told you about my ghost.

1387
01:45:35,747 --> 01:45:37,791
My dad thought I called it a ghost...

1388
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:39,918
...because I was scared of it.

1389
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:44,714
But I was never scared of it.

1390
01:45:46,925 --> 01:45:49,594
I called it a ghost because it felt...

1391
01:45:52,013 --> 01:45:53,682
It felt like a person.

1392
01:45:56,226 --> 01:45:57,894
It was trying to tell me something.

1393
01:46:00,856 --> 01:46:03,859
If there's an answer here on Earth,
it's back there...

1394
01:46:04,317 --> 01:46:06,236
...somehow, in that room.

1395
01:46:06,778 --> 01:46:08,530
So I have to find it.

1396
01:46:11,950 --> 01:46:13,702
We're running out of time.

1397
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:17,622
What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?

1398
01:46:17,789 --> 01:46:19,958
No, they can stay.
I'll be sleeping anyway.

1399
01:46:20,125 --> 01:46:21,710
- Hey, Coop?
- Yeah?

1400
01:46:21,877 --> 01:46:23,879
I have a suggestion
for your return journey.

1401
01:46:24,045 --> 01:46:26,798
- Yeah, what's that?
- Have one last crack at the black hole.

1402
01:46:28,675 --> 01:46:30,260
I'm going home, Rom.

1403
01:46:30,427 --> 01:46:33,680
Yeah, I know.
This isn't going to cost you any time.

1404
01:46:34,431 --> 01:46:36,266
There's a chance for the people on Earth.

1405
01:46:37,017 --> 01:46:40,061
- Talk to me.
- Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.

1406
01:46:40,228 --> 01:46:44,107
- It's what we call a gentle singularity.
- Gentle?

1407
01:46:44,274 --> 01:46:47,736
They're hardly gentle.
But the tidal gravity is so quick that...

1408
01:46:47,903 --> 01:46:52,157
...something crossing the horizon fast
might survive. A probe, say.

1409
01:46:52,324 --> 01:46:56,995
- What happens after it crosses?
- After the horizon is a complete mystery.

1410
01:46:57,162 --> 01:47:00,248
So, what's to say
there isn't some way that the probe...

1411
01:47:00,415 --> 01:47:03,335
...can glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

1412
01:47:03,501 --> 01:47:06,755
If he's equipped to transmit
every form of energy that can pulse.

1413
01:47:06,922 --> 01:47:09,716
Just when did this probe
become a "he," professor?

1414
01:47:10,258 --> 01:47:12,010
TARS is the obvious candidate.

1415
01:47:12,844 --> 01:47:14,763
I've already told him what to look for.

1416
01:47:14,930 --> 01:47:17,641
I'd need the old optical transmitter
off KIPP, Cooper.

1417
01:47:17,807 --> 01:47:19,142
You'd do this for us?

1418
01:47:19,309 --> 01:47:23,229
Before you get all teary, remember that
as a robot I have to do anything you say.

1419
01:47:24,147 --> 01:47:25,607
Your cue light's broken.

1420
01:47:25,774 --> 01:47:27,317
I'm not joking.

1421
01:47:29,945 --> 01:47:33,198
I'll need TARS to remove and adapt
some components from KIPP.

1422
01:47:33,365 --> 01:47:35,700
I don't want to disturb
his archival functions.

1423
01:47:35,867 --> 01:47:37,369
I'll supervise.

1424
01:47:37,702 --> 01:47:38,745
All right.

1425
01:47:38,912 --> 01:47:43,583
Dr. Mann, we need to find three secure sites.
One for Brand's lab, two for habitat.

1426
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:46,211
Once those modules have landed,
you don't want to move them.

1427
01:47:46,378 --> 01:47:48,922
I can take you to the probe sites,
but I don't think...

1428
01:47:49,089 --> 01:47:51,800
...these conditions will hold.
I think we should wait.

1429
01:47:51,967 --> 01:47:54,803
CASE is headed down
with the rest of the distillery equipment.

1430
01:47:54,970 --> 01:47:57,806
I'd really like to secure
those sites by nightfall.

1431
01:47:59,724 --> 01:48:02,811
Well, these squalls do usually blow over.

1432
01:48:03,228 --> 01:48:04,354
Okay, then.

1433
01:48:04,521 --> 01:48:06,731
- You'll need a long-range transmitter.
- Got it.

1434
01:48:06,898 --> 01:48:08,441
- Are you charged?
- Yeah.

1435
01:48:09,025 --> 01:48:10,068
Follow me.

1436
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:13,029
TARS, 72 hours, yeah?

1437
01:48:13,196 --> 01:48:14,406
Roger that, Cooper.

1438
01:48:20,704 --> 01:48:23,748
Brand told me why you feel
you have to go back.

1439
01:48:25,583 --> 01:48:28,336
But I'd be remiss
if I didn't at least mention...

1440
01:48:28,670 --> 01:48:32,841
...that a mission such as ours
could certainly use an extra engineer.

1441
01:48:34,676 --> 01:48:38,930
You better slow down, turbo.
Safety first, CASE, remember.

1442
01:48:39,556 --> 01:48:41,307
Safety first, Cooper.

1443
01:48:42,559 --> 01:48:45,562
I have to tell you, Dr. Mann,
I'm honored to be a part of this.

1444
01:48:45,937 --> 01:48:50,942
But once we set up base camp and secure
those modules, my work's done here.

1445
01:48:51,359 --> 01:48:52,694
I'm going home.

1446
01:49:00,702 --> 01:49:04,205
You have attachments.
But even without a family...

1447
01:49:04,622 --> 01:49:09,085
...I can promise you that that yearning
to be with other people is powerful.

1448
01:49:09,753 --> 01:49:13,089
That emotion is at the foundation...

1449
01:49:13,757 --> 01:49:16,801
...of what makes us human.
It's not to be taken lightly.

1450
01:49:24,809 --> 01:49:27,395
- How long have you had that cough?
- A while.

1451
01:49:37,947 --> 01:49:39,866
Mom lets me play in here.

1452
01:49:41,785 --> 01:49:43,036
I don't touch your stuff.

1453
01:50:14,025 --> 01:50:15,652
Just take this gently.

1454
01:50:20,782 --> 01:50:24,160
You know why we couldn't just send machines
on these missions, don't you?

1455
01:50:24,786 --> 01:50:29,415
A machine doesn't improvise well
because you can't program a fear of death.

1456
01:50:30,291 --> 01:50:32,627
Our survival instinct is
our single greatest...

1457
01:50:32,794 --> 01:50:36,339
...source of inspiration.
Take you, for example.

1458
01:50:37,048 --> 01:50:38,383
A father...

1459
01:50:38,883 --> 01:50:41,886
...with a survival instinct
that extends to your kids.

1460
01:50:43,054 --> 01:50:47,725
What does research tell us is the last thing
you're going to see before you die?

1461
01:50:49,435 --> 01:50:51,896
Your children. Their faces.

1462
01:50:52,230 --> 01:50:54,816
At the moment of death,
your mind's gonna push...

1463
01:50:54,983 --> 01:50:56,693
...a little bit harder to survive.

1464
01:50:57,402 --> 01:50:58,444
For them.

1465
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:00,572
Deep breath.

1466
01:51:02,866 --> 01:51:06,619
Uh, hey. I bet you're Coop.
Why don't you have a seat here for me?

1467
01:51:06,911 --> 01:51:09,247
It's bad. They cannot stay here.

1468
01:51:09,956 --> 01:51:11,249
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1469
01:51:19,591 --> 01:51:21,050
TARS, what's taking so long?

1470
01:51:21,217 --> 01:51:24,095
Professor, I am having trouble
completing the boot up.

1471
01:51:24,262 --> 01:51:25,805
I don't understand.

1472
01:51:32,604 --> 01:51:33,855
It's funny.

1473
01:51:35,940 --> 01:51:37,567
When I left Earth...

1474
01:51:38,568 --> 01:51:40,653
...I thought I was prepared to die.

1475
01:51:42,697 --> 01:51:44,032
The truth is...

1476
01:51:46,242 --> 01:51:51,247
...I never really considered the
possibility that my planet wasn't the one.

1477
01:51:53,958 --> 01:51:56,294
Nothing worked out the way
it was supposed to.

1478
01:51:56,461 --> 01:51:57,503
Let's go.

1479
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:08,765
All right, buddy,
give me a big deep breath.

1480
01:52:13,561 --> 01:52:14,979
What is this?

1481
01:52:15,396 --> 01:52:19,234
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry! I can't let you leave with that ship.

1482
01:52:19,567 --> 01:52:21,903
We're gonna need it
to complete the mission...

1483
01:52:22,237 --> 01:52:25,657
...once the others realize
what this place isn't.

1484
01:52:25,949 --> 01:52:28,701
We cannot survive here. I'm sorry!

1485
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:30,203
I'm sorry!

1486
01:52:39,963 --> 01:52:43,091
- They can't stay here anymore.
- You have to leave right now.

1487
01:52:43,258 --> 01:52:46,803
Let me make something abundantly clear.
You have a responsibility...

1488
01:52:46,970 --> 01:52:50,098
- Oh! Jesus!
- Coop, get her stuff. She's going home.

1489
01:52:50,431 --> 01:52:52,350
Dad didn't raise you to be this dumb, Tom!

1490
01:52:52,517 --> 01:52:56,604
Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did. And
he's buried out back with Mom and Jesse.

1491
01:52:57,188 --> 01:52:59,857
You faked all the data?

1492
01:53:01,567 --> 01:53:02,652
Yeah.

1493
01:53:06,656 --> 01:53:08,366
There's no surface?

1494
01:53:08,533 --> 01:53:09,701
No.

1495
01:53:10,660 --> 01:53:12,662
I tried to do my duty, Cooper...

1496
01:53:12,829 --> 01:53:17,834
...but I knew the day that I arrived here
that this place had nothing.

1497
01:53:18,459 --> 01:53:22,255
And I resisted the temptation for years...

1498
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:24,966
...but I knew that...

1499
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:28,136
...if I just pressed that button, then...

1500
01:53:28,428 --> 01:53:30,430
...somebody would come and save me.

1501
01:53:31,472 --> 01:53:32,974
You fucking coward.

1502
01:53:33,808 --> 01:53:34,851
Yes.

1503
01:53:40,273 --> 01:53:41,316
Yes.

1504
01:53:43,234 --> 01:53:44,277
Yes.

1505
01:53:45,528 --> 01:53:46,571
Yes.

1506
01:53:58,082 --> 01:54:02,628
Listen, if you're not going to go,
let your family go. Just save your family.

1507
01:54:03,129 --> 01:54:05,423
And we go live underground with you?

1508
01:54:05,590 --> 01:54:07,508
Pray that Daddy comes to save us?

1509
01:54:07,675 --> 01:54:11,179
Dad's not coming back.
He never was coming back. It's up to me.

1510
01:54:11,346 --> 01:54:13,222
You're gonna save everybody?

1511
01:54:13,598 --> 01:54:16,434
- Because Dad couldn't do it.
- Dad didn't even try!

1512
01:54:16,601 --> 01:54:18,770
Dad just abandoned us!

1513
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,314
He left us here to die.

1514
01:54:22,023 --> 01:54:23,691
Nobody's going with you.

1515
01:54:27,403 --> 01:54:30,114
You gonna wait for your next kid to die?

1516
01:54:33,117 --> 01:54:34,410
Get out.

1517
01:54:35,286 --> 01:54:36,621
And don't come back.

1518
01:54:41,501 --> 01:54:43,336
You can keep my stuff.

1519
01:54:54,263 --> 01:54:55,640
Stop it!

1520
01:54:58,643 --> 01:55:00,228
No. No!

1521
01:55:01,312 --> 01:55:04,190
Dr. Mann, there's a 50-50 chance
you're gonna kill yourself!

1522
01:55:05,024 --> 01:55:07,026
Those are the best odds I've had in years.

1523
01:55:27,463 --> 01:55:29,298
Don't judge me, Cooper.

1524
01:55:30,049 --> 01:55:32,301
You were never tested like I was.

1525
01:55:32,927 --> 01:55:34,387
Few men have been.

1526
01:55:42,728 --> 01:55:43,896
You tried your best, Murph.

1527
01:55:53,406 --> 01:55:54,782
You're feeling it, aren't you?

1528
01:55:56,451 --> 01:55:58,286
The survival instinct.

1529
01:55:59,203 --> 01:56:03,541
That's what drove me. It's what drives all of us.
And it's what's gonna save us.

1530
01:56:04,709 --> 01:56:08,045
Because I want to save all of us.
For you, Cooper.

1531
01:56:13,217 --> 01:56:16,762
I'm sorry, I can't watch you
go through this. I'm sorry.

1532
01:56:17,096 --> 01:56:19,765
I thought I could, but I can't.

1533
01:56:20,850 --> 01:56:23,019
I'm here. I'm here for you.

1534
01:56:23,311 --> 01:56:25,354
Just listen to my voice, Cooper.

1535
01:56:26,147 --> 01:56:27,482
I'm right here.

1536
01:56:29,317 --> 01:56:30,651
You're not alone.

1537
01:56:40,369 --> 01:56:41,871
Do you see your children?

1538
01:56:45,124 --> 01:56:46,459
It's okay.

1539
01:56:47,418 --> 01:56:49,170
They're right there with you.

1540
01:56:53,049 --> 01:56:55,635
Did Professor Brand tell you
that poem before you left?

1541
01:56:56,469 --> 01:56:57,970
Do you remember?

1542
01:57:00,348 --> 01:57:03,017
Do not go gentle into that good night

1543
01:57:04,936 --> 01:57:07,730
Old age should burn and rave

1544
01:57:07,897 --> 01:57:09,482
At close of day

1545
01:57:11,067 --> 01:57:13,444
Rage, rage against the dying of the light

1546
01:57:38,094 --> 01:57:39,762
Brand! Help!

1547
01:57:39,929 --> 01:57:41,889
- Help!
- Cooper?

1548
01:57:48,604 --> 01:57:49,814
CASE!

1549
01:57:50,189 --> 01:57:51,482
No air.

1550
01:57:52,316 --> 01:57:53,526
Ammonia.

1551
01:57:54,610 --> 01:57:57,113
Cooper. Cooper, we're coming! CASE!

1552
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:59,198
- I have a fix.
- Go! Go, go, go!

1553
01:57:59,365 --> 01:58:01,450
And away!

1554
01:58:13,004 --> 01:58:15,214
Cooper, we're coming.
Hang in there. Don't talk.

1555
01:58:15,381 --> 01:58:17,675
Try to breathe as little as possible.
We're almost there.

1556
01:58:21,345 --> 01:58:23,347
There's a security lockout, sir.

1557
01:58:23,514 --> 01:58:26,767
It requires a person to access function.

1558
01:58:31,814 --> 01:58:33,316
It's all yours, sir.

1559
01:58:41,532 --> 01:58:42,992
Try not to breathe.

1560
01:58:43,993 --> 01:58:45,661
We're coming. We're coming right now.

1561
01:58:45,828 --> 01:58:47,955
CASE, come on! Come on!

1562
01:58:48,122 --> 01:58:50,833
We got to go faster, CASE!
Faster, faster, faster!

1563
01:58:55,338 --> 01:58:57,048
Hang in there. Come on.

1564
01:59:03,554 --> 01:59:06,849
I see him, I see him!
CASE, bank! Bank right!

1565
01:59:25,868 --> 01:59:27,411
Cooper! Cooper!

1566
01:59:27,787 --> 01:59:28,871
I'm here!

1567
01:59:52,103 --> 01:59:54,105
This data makes no sense.

1568
02:00:02,530 --> 02:00:03,781
I'm sorry.

1569
02:00:04,115 --> 02:00:06,701
- What?
- Mann was lying!

1570
02:00:14,458 --> 02:00:16,252
Go. Go.

1571
02:00:17,336 --> 02:00:18,379
Romilly.

1572
02:00:18,754 --> 02:00:19,797
Romilly!

1573
02:00:20,131 --> 02:00:22,550
Romilly! Do you read me, Romilly?

1574
02:00:23,134 --> 02:00:25,136
Step back, professor! Step back!

1575
02:00:33,060 --> 02:00:35,646
- Romilly...
- Romilly, do you read me?

1576
02:00:38,649 --> 02:00:39,984
Keep watch!

1577
02:00:41,152 --> 02:00:42,278
Lois?

1578
02:00:42,778 --> 02:00:45,281
- What happened to caution, CASE?
- Safety first, Cooper.

1579
02:00:46,657 --> 02:00:50,077
Romilly? Romilly, do you read me?
This is Brand.

1580
02:00:52,955 --> 02:00:53,998
Romilly?

1581
02:00:54,165 --> 02:00:56,751
Dr. Brand. Cooper.
There's been an explosion.

1582
02:00:57,376 --> 02:00:59,170
Dr. Mann's compound.

1583
02:01:26,781 --> 02:01:28,824
TARS, TARS, 10 o'clock!

1584
02:01:35,206 --> 02:01:37,166
Let me know when TARS is aboard.

1585
02:01:40,795 --> 02:01:42,671
Romilly did not survive.

1586
02:01:43,881 --> 02:01:45,549
I could not save him.

1587
02:01:45,716 --> 02:01:47,176
- TARS is in.
- I'll take her now.

1588
02:01:47,343 --> 02:01:50,221
- Do we have a fix on the Ranger?
- He's pushing into orbit!

1589
02:01:50,387 --> 02:01:53,390
If he takes control of that ship,
we're dead.

1590
02:01:54,600 --> 02:01:57,561
- He'd maroon us?
- He is marooning us.

1591
02:01:59,563 --> 02:02:02,066
I'll meet you guys downstairs.
Go wait by the car.

1592
02:02:09,907 --> 02:02:14,119
Come on! Give me your bag.
Get in the backseat. Get in the backseat now!

1593
02:02:19,750 --> 02:02:21,669
Dr. Mann, please respond.

1594
02:02:22,294 --> 02:02:24,380
Dr. Mann, please respond!

1595
02:02:24,547 --> 02:02:26,757
He doesn't know
the Endurance docking procedure.

1596
02:02:26,924 --> 02:02:29,426
- The autopilot does.
- Not since TARS disabled it.

1597
02:02:30,636 --> 02:02:31,679
Nice.

1598
02:02:31,846 --> 02:02:34,765
- What's your trust setting, TARS?
- Lower than yours apparently.

1599
02:02:38,394 --> 02:02:41,939
Do not attempt docking.
I repeat, do not attempt docking.

1600
02:02:42,106 --> 02:02:43,148
Please res...

1601
02:03:42,583 --> 02:03:44,960
Auto-docking sequence withheld.

1602
02:03:45,127 --> 02:03:47,796
Override.
Unauthorized.

1603
02:03:48,505 --> 02:03:49,840
Override.

1604
02:03:50,341 --> 02:03:52,217
Unauthorized.

1605
02:03:56,347 --> 02:04:00,476
Do not attempt docking. I repeat,
do not attempt docking. Please resp...

1606
02:04:44,269 --> 02:04:46,438
Moving slowly toward the Endurance.

1607
02:05:10,963 --> 02:05:12,548
Imperfect contact.

1608
02:05:12,715 --> 02:05:14,758
- Override.
- Hatch lockout.

1609
02:05:22,558 --> 02:05:25,102
- Is he locked on yet?
- Imperfectly.

1610
02:05:26,937 --> 02:05:28,188
Dr. Mann, do not...

1611
02:05:49,668 --> 02:05:52,671
Hatch lockout disengaged.

1612
02:06:01,221 --> 02:06:04,725
Dr. Mann, do not,
I repeat, do not open the hatch.

1613
02:06:05,059 --> 02:06:06,935
I repeat, do not open the hatch.

1614
02:06:07,102 --> 02:06:09,938
If you open the hatch,
the airlock will depressurize.

1615
02:06:35,839 --> 02:06:38,133
- What happens if he blows the airlock?
- Nothing good.

1616
02:06:44,014 --> 02:06:46,642
Okay, pull back. Retro thrusters,
everything we've got, CASE!

1617
02:06:46,809 --> 02:06:48,519
- Thrusters are full!
- Back!

1618
02:06:48,685 --> 02:06:50,687
Relay my transmission
to the onboard computer...

1619
02:06:50,854 --> 02:06:52,940
...and have it rebroadcast as
emergency P.A.

1620
02:06:53,107 --> 02:06:54,149
Dr. Mann...

1621
02:06:56,735 --> 02:06:59,613
I repeat, do not open
the inner hatch. I repeat...

1622
02:06:59,780 --> 02:07:00,823
Brand?

1623
02:07:01,657 --> 02:07:03,700
I don't know what he said to you...

1624
02:07:03,867 --> 02:07:06,537
...but I am taking command
of the Endurance.

1625
02:07:06,995 --> 02:07:09,039
And then we can talk
about completing the mission.

1626
02:07:12,501 --> 02:07:14,211
Dr. Mann, listen to me.

1627
02:07:15,003 --> 02:07:17,005
This is not about my life.

1628
02:07:17,631 --> 02:07:20,884
Or Cooper's life.
This is about all mankind.

1629
02:07:21,468 --> 02:07:22,886
There is a moment...

1630
02:07:29,226 --> 02:07:30,561
It is not sa...

1631
02:07:38,861 --> 02:07:39,903
Oh, my God.

1632
02:07:58,213 --> 02:08:02,176
- There's no point using fuel to chase...
- Analyze the Endurance's spin.

1633
02:08:07,431 --> 02:08:09,641
- Cooper, what are you doing?
- Docking.

1634
02:08:14,229 --> 02:08:17,065
Endurance rotation is 67, 68 RPM.

1635
02:08:17,232 --> 02:08:19,693
Okay, get ready to match our spin
with the retro thrusters.

1636
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:21,945
- It's not possible.
- No...

1637
02:08:22,112 --> 02:08:23,280
...it's necessary.

1638
02:08:34,917 --> 02:08:37,085
Endurance is hitting stratosphere!

1639
02:08:41,131 --> 02:08:43,175
She's got no heat shield.

1640
02:08:46,303 --> 02:08:48,055
- CASE, you ready?
- Ready.

1641
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:59,650
Cooper! This is no time for caution.

1642
02:09:01,193 --> 02:09:03,654
CASE, if I black out, you take the stick.

1643
02:09:03,820 --> 02:09:06,281
TARS, get ready to engage
the docking mechanism.

1644
02:09:13,330 --> 02:09:14,831
Endurance is starting to heat.

1645
02:09:14,998 --> 02:09:16,333
Twenty feet out.

1646
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:19,002
I need three degrees starboard, Cooper.

1647
02:09:19,169 --> 02:09:21,171
Ten feet out.

1648
02:09:21,338 --> 02:09:23,840
Cooper, we are lined up.

1649
02:09:24,007 --> 02:09:25,592
Initiating spin!

1650
02:10:07,175 --> 02:10:08,385
Come on, TARS.

1651
02:10:16,643 --> 02:10:18,186
Come on, TARS!

1652
02:10:29,406 --> 02:10:31,825
- We are locked, Cooper.
- Locked. Easing up!

1653
02:10:39,708 --> 02:10:41,043
Easy.

1654
02:10:42,210 --> 02:10:43,545
Easy.

1655
02:10:49,384 --> 02:10:50,886
Retro thrusters!

1656
02:10:58,852 --> 02:11:00,354
Main engines on.

1657
02:11:06,109 --> 02:11:08,820
Pushing out of orbit. Come on, baby.

1658
02:11:16,828 --> 02:11:18,497
Killing main engines!

1659
02:11:19,748 --> 02:11:21,416
Okay, we're out of orbit.

1660
02:11:28,757 --> 02:11:31,635
Okay. And for our next trick!

1661
02:11:33,470 --> 02:11:37,307
It'll have to be good.
We're heading into Gargantua's pull.

1662
02:11:38,225 --> 02:11:39,267
Oh, shit.

1663
02:11:39,768 --> 02:11:41,561
- CASE, take the stick.
- Roger that.

1664
02:12:31,528 --> 02:12:33,864
Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua.

1665
02:12:35,198 --> 02:12:37,159
Shall I use main engines?

1666
02:12:37,325 --> 02:12:38,368
No.

1667
02:12:38,952 --> 02:12:41,204
We got to let her slide as far as we can.

1668
02:12:50,005 --> 02:12:52,883
- Give it to me.
- There's good news, there's bad news.

1669
02:12:53,049 --> 02:12:56,678
Yeah, I've heard that one, TARS.
Give it to me straight.

1670
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:08,732
The backup generator kicked in,
so the system's stable. They're all good.

1671
02:13:08,899 --> 02:13:09,941
Good.

1672
02:13:10,358 --> 02:13:13,695
Okay. The navigational hub
has been completely destroyed.

1673
02:13:13,862 --> 02:13:16,823
We don't have enough life support
to make it back to Earth...

1674
02:13:16,990 --> 02:13:19,075
...but we can scratch our way
to Edmunds' planet.

1675
02:13:19,242 --> 02:13:20,577
What about fuel?

1676
02:13:20,994 --> 02:13:23,497
Not enough. But I have a plan.

1677
02:13:24,122 --> 02:13:28,126
We let Gargantua pull us down
close to her horizon.

1678
02:13:28,627 --> 02:13:31,880
Then a powered slingshot around,
launching us towards Edmunds' planet.

1679
02:13:32,047 --> 02:13:34,549
- Manually?
- That's what I'm here for.

1680
02:13:34,716 --> 02:13:37,427
I'm gonna take us just inside
the critical orbit.

1681
02:13:37,594 --> 02:13:40,114
- What about time slippage?
- Neither of us has time to worry...

1682
02:13:40,263 --> 02:13:41,932
...about relativity right now, Dr. Brand.

1683
02:13:46,561 --> 02:13:48,063
I'm sorry, Cooper.

1684
02:13:51,191 --> 02:13:54,444
Once we've gathered
enough speed around Gargantua...

1685
02:13:54,778 --> 02:13:56,613
...we use Lander 1...

1686
02:13:57,113 --> 02:13:59,407
...and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters to...

1687
02:14:00,575 --> 02:14:02,577
...push us out of the black hole's gravity.

1688
02:14:04,913 --> 02:14:07,582
The Lender's linkages
have been destroyed...

1689
02:14:07,749 --> 02:14:10,085
...so we'll have to control manually.

1690
02:14:11,294 --> 02:14:14,756
Once Lander 1 is spent, TARS will detach...

1691
02:14:14,923 --> 02:14:16,633
And get sucked into that black hole.

1692
02:14:17,259 --> 02:14:19,219
Why does TARS have to detach?

1693
02:14:19,386 --> 02:14:21,429
We have to shed the weight
to escape the gravity.

1694
02:14:21,596 --> 02:14:22,973
Newton's third law.

1695
02:14:23,139 --> 02:14:25,850
The only way humans have ever
figured out of getting somewhere...

1696
02:14:26,017 --> 02:14:27,561
...is to leave something behind.

1697
02:14:27,727 --> 02:14:30,772
Cooper, you can't ask TARS
to do this for us.

1698
02:14:30,939 --> 02:14:34,776
He's a robot. So you don't have
to ask him to do anything.

1699
02:14:34,943 --> 02:14:36,236
Cooper, you asshole!

1700
02:14:36,611 --> 02:14:38,613
Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.

1701
02:14:38,863 --> 02:14:41,116
It's what we intended, Dr. Brand.

1702
02:14:41,449 --> 02:14:43,910
It's our only chance
to save people on Earth.

1703
02:14:44,077 --> 02:14:47,289
If I can find a way to transmit
the quantum data I'll find in there...

1704
02:14:47,455 --> 02:14:49,291
...they might still make it.

1705
02:14:50,333 --> 02:14:52,961
Let's just hope
there's still someone there to save.

1706
02:15:21,448 --> 02:15:23,116
Maximum velocity achieved.

1707
02:15:24,367 --> 02:15:26,870
Prepare to fire escape thrusters.

1708
02:15:27,037 --> 02:15:28,121
Ready?

1709
02:15:28,288 --> 02:15:29,706
Ready.

1710
02:15:29,873 --> 02:15:31,041
Ready.

1711
02:15:31,207 --> 02:15:33,001
Main engine ignition in three...

1712
02:15:33,168 --> 02:15:34,336
...two...

1713
02:15:34,961 --> 02:15:36,796
...one. Mark.

1714
02:15:50,226 --> 02:15:51,478
Come on, baby.

1715
02:15:52,646 --> 02:15:54,814
Lander 1 engines, on my mark.

1716
02:15:55,148 --> 02:15:56,191
Three...

1717
02:15:56,608 --> 02:15:57,734
...two...

1718
02:15:57,901 --> 02:15:59,402
...one. Mark.

1719
02:16:04,741 --> 02:16:07,327
Ranger 2 engines, on my mark.

1720
02:16:07,494 --> 02:16:09,871
Three, two, one...

1721
02:16:10,413 --> 02:16:11,581
- Mark.
- Fire!

1722
02:16:21,716 --> 02:16:24,886
This little maneuver's
gonna cost us 51 years!

1723
02:16:25,762 --> 02:16:28,264
You don't sound so bad for pushing 120!

1724
02:16:43,655 --> 02:16:46,825
Lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark.

1725
02:16:47,492 --> 02:16:49,494
Three, two...

1726
02:16:51,121 --> 02:16:52,706
...one. Mark.

1727
02:16:52,872 --> 02:16:53,957
Detach!

1728
02:16:57,127 --> 02:16:59,629
- Goodbye, TARS.
- Goodbye, Dr. Brand.

1729
02:16:59,796 --> 02:17:02,799
- See you on the other side, Coop.
- See you there, Slick!

1730
02:17:11,307 --> 02:17:12,892
Okay, CASE.

1731
02:17:13,935 --> 02:17:17,313
- Nice reckless flying!
- Learned from the master.

1732
02:17:17,772 --> 02:17:20,358
- Ranger 2, prepare to detach.
- What?

1733
02:17:20,525 --> 02:17:23,445
No! No! Cooper! What are you doing?

1734
02:17:23,903 --> 02:17:27,615
Newton's third law.
You got to leave something behind.

1735
02:17:27,782 --> 02:17:30,201
You told me we had enough resources
for both of us.

1736
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:32,120
We agreed, Amelia...

1737
02:17:32,495 --> 02:17:33,955
...90 percent.

1738
02:17:35,832 --> 02:17:36,916
Don't.

1739
02:17:39,127 --> 02:17:40,295
Detach.

1740
02:17:53,391 --> 02:17:56,144
Okay, I am nosing down.

1741
02:17:59,939 --> 02:18:01,941
Approaching the event horizon.

1742
02:18:04,194 --> 02:18:06,446
Portside, dipping down beneath it...

1743
02:18:07,030 --> 02:18:08,698
...to go through it.

1744
02:18:10,283 --> 02:18:13,119
Heading towards blackness.

1745
02:18:13,453 --> 02:18:15,455
I have a visual of the event.

1746
02:18:15,955 --> 02:18:17,332
It's all black.

1747
02:18:19,459 --> 02:18:21,127
TARS, do you read me?

1748
02:18:21,461 --> 02:18:22,962
It's all blackness.

1749
02:18:24,964 --> 02:18:26,966
TARS! Do you read me? Over.

1750
02:18:31,805 --> 02:18:32,972
Okay.

1751
02:18:34,182 --> 02:18:35,433
Screens...

1752
02:18:37,060 --> 02:18:38,561
...getting interference.

1753
02:18:40,271 --> 02:18:42,857
Losing control of the stick. I got flashes.

1754
02:18:43,441 --> 02:18:45,610
Flashes of lightness and blackness.

1755
02:18:46,820 --> 02:18:49,322
The turbulence in the gravity
is increasing.

1756
02:18:54,244 --> 02:18:55,495
Ah.

1757
02:18:55,995 --> 02:18:58,832
The computers are going down. Agh.

1758
02:19:09,926 --> 02:19:12,762
Gravitational pull.
I'm losing control of the stick.

1759
02:19:46,129 --> 02:19:47,797
Murph? Murph, come on!

1760
02:19:53,469 --> 02:19:55,471
Eject. Eject.

1761
02:19:56,973 --> 02:19:58,057
Eject.

1762
02:19:58,474 --> 02:19:59,642
Eject.

1763
02:20:00,184 --> 02:20:01,227
Eject.

1764
02:20:01,936 --> 02:20:03,021
Eject.

1765
02:21:55,216 --> 02:21:56,259
Murph.

1766
02:22:06,227 --> 02:22:08,396
Murph! Murph! Murph!

1767
02:22:16,779 --> 02:22:17,822
Murphy

1768
02:22:25,038 --> 02:22:26,956
No, no, no!

1769
02:22:27,123 --> 02:22:28,416
Murphy

1770
02:22:28,583 --> 02:22:30,084
Murphy

1771
02:22:30,251 --> 02:22:31,294
No! No!

1772
02:23:30,978 --> 02:23:32,939
If you're leaving, just go.

1773
02:23:33,439 --> 02:23:34,607
No, no. No.

1774
02:23:36,192 --> 02:23:38,528
No, don't go. Don't go, you idiot.

1775
02:23:38,694 --> 02:23:39,987
Don't go!

1776
02:23:41,948 --> 02:23:43,616
Morse. Morse.

1777
02:23:44,367 --> 02:23:45,409
Morse.

1778
02:23:46,619 --> 02:23:48,412
Dot. Dot.

1779
02:23:48,579 --> 02:23:49,622
S.

1780
02:23:55,753 --> 02:23:56,796
T.

1781
02:24:01,384 --> 02:24:02,468
A.

1782
02:24:02,635 --> 02:24:03,719
Dash!

1783
02:24:06,514 --> 02:24:07,849
Dash! Dash!

1784
02:24:08,349 --> 02:24:09,392
Murph!

1785
02:24:09,559 --> 02:24:11,561
Murph, we don't have time for this!
Come on!

1786
02:24:11,978 --> 02:24:13,104
Y.

1787
02:24:18,401 --> 02:24:19,443
"Stay!"

1788
02:24:30,538 --> 02:24:32,874
Come on. Come on, Murph. Come on!

1789
02:24:33,541 --> 02:24:35,334
What's it say? What's it say, Murph?

1790
02:24:36,127 --> 02:24:37,211
What's it say?

1791
02:24:47,763 --> 02:24:48,890
"Stay."

1792
02:25:24,634 --> 02:25:26,093
Tell him, Murph.

1793
02:25:26,260 --> 02:25:27,470
Make him stay.

1794
02:25:30,806 --> 02:25:32,475
Make him stay, Murph.

1795
02:25:41,484 --> 02:25:43,361
Make him stay, Murph.

1796
02:25:44,820 --> 02:25:46,948
Don't let me leave, Murph!

1797
02:25:50,159 --> 02:25:52,578
Don't let me leave, Murph!

1798
02:25:58,376 --> 02:26:00,711
No! No! No!

1799
02:26:21,399 --> 02:26:22,900
It was you.

1800
02:26:34,370 --> 02:26:36,414
You were my ghost.

1801
02:26:46,132 --> 02:26:49,135
Cooper. Cooper. Come in, Cooper.

1802
02:26:50,928 --> 02:26:53,431
- TARS?
- Roger that.

1803
02:26:55,224 --> 02:26:57,852
- You survived.
- Somewhere...

1804
02:26:58,394 --> 02:27:00,438
...in their fifth dimension.

1805
02:27:00,604 --> 02:27:02,940
They saved us.

1806
02:27:03,107 --> 02:27:08,321
Yeah? Who the hell is "they"?
And just why would they want to help us?

1807
02:27:08,487 --> 02:27:11,198
I don't know, but they constructed
this three-dimensional space...

1808
02:27:11,365 --> 02:27:14,660
...inside their five-dimensional reality
to allow you to understand it.

1809
02:27:14,827 --> 02:27:16,787
Yeah, that ain't working.

1810
02:27:16,954 --> 02:27:18,497
Yes, it is.

1811
02:27:18,664 --> 02:27:22,543
You've seen that time is represented here
as a physical dimension.

1812
02:27:22,710 --> 02:27:25,546
You have worked out that you can exert
a force across space-time.

1813
02:27:26,213 --> 02:27:29,383
Gravity to send a message.

1814
02:27:29,759 --> 02:27:31,093
Affirmative.

1815
02:27:33,679 --> 02:27:34,805
Gravity...

1816
02:27:35,931 --> 02:27:39,268
...can cross the dimensions,
including time.

1817
02:27:39,602 --> 02:27:40,895
Apparently.

1818
02:27:44,774 --> 02:27:46,776
Do you have the quantum data?

1819
02:27:47,193 --> 02:27:48,819
Roger. I have it.

1820
02:27:49,779 --> 02:27:53,783
I am transmitting it on all wavelengths,
but nothing is getting out, Cooper.

1821
02:27:53,949 --> 02:27:56,202
I can do this. I can do this.

1822
02:27:56,660 --> 02:27:59,413
But such complicated data to a child?

1823
02:27:59,580 --> 02:28:00,706
Not just any child.

1824
02:28:00,873 --> 02:28:02,249
What else?

1825
02:28:02,792 --> 02:28:04,960
Oh, come on, Dad.

1826
02:28:07,129 --> 02:28:09,298
Murph, the fire's out! Come on!

1827
02:28:09,465 --> 02:28:13,469
Even if you communicate it here, she won't
understand its significance for years.

1828
02:28:14,261 --> 02:28:15,721
I get that, TARS.

1829
02:28:15,888 --> 02:28:20,559
But we've got to figure something out
or the people on Earth are gonna die. Think!

1830
02:28:20,726 --> 02:28:22,311
Cooper...

1831
02:28:22,478 --> 02:28:24,980
...they didn't bring us here
to change the past.

1832
02:28:28,567 --> 02:28:30,069
Say that again.

1833
02:28:30,236 --> 02:28:33,697
They didn't bring us here
to change the past.

1834
02:28:38,119 --> 02:28:40,079
No, they didn't bring us here at all.

1835
02:28:44,708 --> 02:28:46,377
We brought ourselves.

1836
02:28:55,636 --> 02:28:59,682
TARS, give me the coordinates
for NASA in binary.

1837
02:29:00,224 --> 02:29:02,685
In binary. Roger. Feeding data.

1838
02:29:27,001 --> 02:29:28,919
"It's not a ghost."

1839
02:29:30,671 --> 02:29:32,173
"It's gravity."

1840
02:29:32,506 --> 02:29:34,175
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

1841
02:29:34,842 --> 02:29:36,635
I brought myself here!

1842
02:29:37,511 --> 02:29:41,015
We're here to communicate
with the three-dimensional world.

1843
02:29:41,432 --> 02:29:42,933
We're the bridge!

1844
02:29:50,941 --> 02:29:52,735
I thought they chose me.

1845
02:29:56,071 --> 02:29:59,742
- But they didn't choose me, they chose her.
- For what, Cooper?

1846
02:30:02,244 --> 02:30:03,913
To save the world.

1847
02:30:08,209 --> 02:30:12,588
All of this is one little girl's bedroom.
Every moment.

1848
02:30:12,922 --> 02:30:14,340
It's infinitely complex.

1849
02:30:14,507 --> 02:30:19,261
They have access to infinite time and space,
but they're not bound by anything!

1850
02:30:19,428 --> 02:30:24,099
They can't find a specific place in time.
They can't communicate.

1851
02:30:25,601 --> 02:30:28,604
That's why I'm here.
I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph...

1852
02:30:28,771 --> 02:30:30,272
...just like I found this moment.

1853
02:30:30,439 --> 02:30:32,775
- How, Cooper?
- Love, TARS, love.

1854
02:30:32,942 --> 02:30:37,363
It's just like Brand said. My connection
with Murph, it is quantifiable. It's the key!

1855
02:30:37,530 --> 02:30:39,406
What are we here to do?

1856
02:30:40,324 --> 02:30:42,201
Find how to tell her.

1857
02:30:44,995 --> 02:30:46,330
The watch.

1858
02:30:49,458 --> 02:30:50,626
The watch.

1859
02:30:52,002 --> 02:30:53,128
That's it.

1860
02:30:55,631 --> 02:30:58,634
We code the data into the movement
of the second hand.

1861
02:31:02,263 --> 02:31:05,474
TARS, translate the data into Morse
and feed it to me.

1862
02:31:05,641 --> 02:31:09,937
Translating data to Morse.
Cooper, what if she never came back for it?

1863
02:31:11,605 --> 02:31:14,275
She Will. She Will.

1864
02:31:15,484 --> 02:31:17,111
Murph, I can see his car!

1865
02:31:18,320 --> 02:31:19,488
He's coming, Murph!

1866
02:31:21,323 --> 02:31:23,158
Okay. I'm coming down.

1867
02:31:24,618 --> 02:31:26,120
How do you know?

1868
02:31:29,331 --> 02:31:31,166
Because I gave it to her.

1869
02:31:36,547 --> 02:31:39,049
Roger. Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.

1870
02:31:42,553 --> 02:31:43,679
Dot-dot...

1871
02:31:45,014 --> 02:31:46,682
...dash-dot.

1872
02:31:47,141 --> 02:31:48,809
Dot-dash-dot-dot.

1873
02:31:49,184 --> 02:31:51,854
Dot-dash-dot-dot.

1874
02:31:52,354 --> 02:31:53,689
Dash-dash-dash.

1875
02:31:54,023 --> 02:31:56,275
Dash, dash, dash.

1876
02:32:14,543 --> 02:32:15,878
He came back!

1877
02:32:16,795 --> 02:32:20,966
It was him all the time!
I didn't know. It was him!

1878
02:32:22,051 --> 02:32:24,011
Dad's gonna save us.

1879
02:33:06,762 --> 02:33:08,013
Eureka!

1880
02:33:11,767 --> 02:33:13,102
It's traditional.

1881
02:33:17,690 --> 02:33:19,316
Eureka!

1882
02:33:24,029 --> 02:33:25,531
Did it work?

1883
02:33:25,698 --> 02:33:27,533
I think it might have.

1884
02:33:28,909 --> 02:33:30,202
How do you know?

1885
02:33:30,369 --> 02:33:33,747
Because the bulk beings
are closing the tesseract.

1886
02:33:37,584 --> 02:33:39,586
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

1887
02:33:40,754 --> 02:33:42,589
They're not "beings."

1888
02:33:43,257 --> 02:33:44,591
They're us.

1889
02:33:46,635 --> 02:33:49,763
What I've been doing for Murph,
they're doing for me.

1890
02:33:50,305 --> 02:33:51,807
For all of us.

1891
02:33:51,974 --> 02:33:54,226
Cooper, people couldn't build this.

1892
02:33:54,393 --> 02:33:56,770
No. No, not yet.

1893
02:33:57,146 --> 02:33:58,605
But one day.

1894
02:33:59,273 --> 02:34:02,484
Not you and me. But people.

1895
02:34:03,152 --> 02:34:07,197
A civilization that's evolved past
the four dimensions we know.

1896
02:34:13,787 --> 02:34:15,289
What happens now?

1897
02:35:17,893 --> 02:35:19,353
Mr. Cooper.

1898
02:35:23,565 --> 02:35:25,275
All right. Let's take it slow, sir.

1899
02:35:25,692 --> 02:35:27,820
Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.

1900
02:35:27,986 --> 02:35:33,033
Remember, you're no spring chicken anymore.
Actually, you are 124 years old.

1901
02:35:40,040 --> 02:35:41,375
Take it slow, sir.

1902
02:35:42,292 --> 02:35:44,586
You were, uh, extremely lucky.

1903
02:35:44,920 --> 02:35:48,257
The Rangers found you with only minutes
left in your oxygen supply.

1904
02:36:02,437 --> 02:36:03,772
Where am I?

1905
02:36:05,440 --> 02:36:06,984
Cooper Station.

1906
02:36:08,402 --> 02:36:09,945
Currently orbiting Saturn.

1907
02:36:11,947 --> 02:36:13,991
Cooper Station.

1908
02:36:16,451 --> 02:36:18,453
Nice of you to name it after me.

1909
02:36:22,291 --> 02:36:23,375
What?

1910
02:36:23,542 --> 02:36:26,753
The station isn't named after you, sir.
It's, uh, named after your daughter.

1911
02:36:27,254 --> 02:36:30,257
Although she's always maintained
just how important you were.

1912
02:36:30,424 --> 02:36:32,134
Is she still alive'?

1913
02:36:34,094 --> 02:36:35,971
She'll be here in a couple weeks.

1914
02:36:37,014 --> 02:36:39,474
She is far too old to be transferring
from another station...

1915
02:36:39,641 --> 02:36:42,019
...but when she heard
that you'd been found...

1916
02:36:43,228 --> 02:36:45,939
...well, this is, uh, Murphy Cooper
we're talking about.

1917
02:36:46,815 --> 02:36:48,317
Yes, it is.

1918
02:36:50,444 --> 02:36:52,946
We'll have you checked out of here
in a couple days.

1919
02:36:55,616 --> 02:36:58,118
I'm sure you'll be excited to see
what's in store.

1920
02:36:59,369 --> 02:37:03,332
I actually, uh, did a paper on you
in high school.

1921
02:37:03,665 --> 02:37:06,001
I know all about your life back on Earth.

1922
02:37:07,669 --> 02:37:08,837
Oh, yeah.

1923
02:37:09,004 --> 02:37:10,255
Right.

1924
02:37:12,674 --> 02:37:18,013
If... If you'll follow me,
we've got a really good situation for you.

1925
02:37:21,350 --> 02:37:25,395
So, uh, when I made my suggestion
to Miss Cooper...

1926
02:37:26,313 --> 02:37:29,107
...I was delighted to hear
that she thought it was perfect.

1927
02:37:32,486 --> 02:37:35,781
It was just constant.
Just that steady blow of dirt.

1928
02:37:35,948 --> 02:37:38,867
Of course,
I didn't speak to her personally.

1929
02:37:39,034 --> 02:37:41,036
We always set the plate upside-down.

1930
02:37:41,203 --> 02:37:43,956
Glasses or cups,
whatever it was, upside-down.

1931
02:37:44,122 --> 02:37:49,044
Well, my dad was a farmer.
Uh, like everybody else back then.

1932
02:37:49,211 --> 02:37:51,672
There just wasn't enough food.

1933
02:37:51,838 --> 02:37:54,549
We wore little things, little strips...

1934
02:37:54,716 --> 02:37:59,888
...of sheet over our nose and mouth
so we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

1935
02:38:00,055 --> 02:38:03,517
Well, it was pretty exciting for me
because it was hope.

1936
02:38:03,684 --> 02:38:07,896
I don't care who describes it, there is no way
for it to be exaggerated. It was that bad.

1937
02:38:08,063 --> 02:38:11,733
She did confirm just how much
you loved farming.

1938
02:38:12,067 --> 02:38:13,735
- Oh, she did, did she?
- Yeah.

1939
02:38:13,902 --> 02:38:15,112
Come here.

1940
02:38:15,696 --> 02:38:20,659
Home sweet home. Everything
replaced and put back where it...

1941
02:38:27,040 --> 02:38:29,084
- Hey, is this...?
- Oh, yeah.

1942
02:38:29,251 --> 02:38:32,254
The machine we found out near Saturn
when we found you. Yes.

1943
02:38:32,421 --> 02:38:35,090
Its, uh, power source was shot,
but we could get you another one.

1944
02:38:35,257 --> 02:38:37,426
Yes. Please.

1945
02:38:38,635 --> 02:38:39,970
Settings.

1946
02:38:40,429 --> 02:38:41,930
General settings.

1947
02:38:42,431 --> 02:38:44,266
Security settings.

1948
02:38:46,977 --> 02:38:49,271
Honesty, new setting:

1949
02:38:50,439 --> 02:38:52,065
95 percent.

1950
02:38:52,399 --> 02:38:54,901
Confirmed. Additional customization?

1951
02:38:55,777 --> 02:38:56,903
Humor:

1952
02:38:58,405 --> 02:38:59,906
75 percent.

1953
02:39:00,282 --> 02:39:01,616
Confirmed.

1954
02:39:02,284 --> 02:39:05,412
Auto self-destruct T-minus 10, nine...

1955
02:39:05,579 --> 02:39:07,497
Let's make that 60 percent.

1956
02:39:09,791 --> 02:39:11,918
Sixty percent confirmed.

1957
02:39:12,544 --> 02:39:15,630
- Knock-knock.
- You want 55?

1958
02:39:20,510 --> 02:39:22,637
Is this really what it was like?

1959
02:39:24,848 --> 02:39:27,267
It was never this clean, Slick. Heh.

1960
02:39:31,772 --> 02:39:35,442
I don't care much for this pretending
we're back where we started.

1961
02:39:37,527 --> 02:39:39,821
I want to know where we are.

1962
02:39:41,448 --> 02:39:42,991
Where we're going.

1963
02:39:47,537 --> 02:39:50,624
- Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there.
- Yeah.

1964
02:39:50,791 --> 02:39:51,875
Family?

1965
02:39:52,042 --> 02:39:55,921
Yeah, they all came out to see her.
She's been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.

1966
02:40:28,995 --> 02:40:30,872
You told them I like farming.

1967
02:40:36,837 --> 02:40:38,505
It was me, Murph.

1968
02:40:40,966 --> 02:40:42,759
I was your ghost.

1969
02:40:44,052 --> 02:40:45,679
I know.

1970
02:40:47,472 --> 02:40:52,185
People didn't believe me. They thought
that I was doing it all myself.

1971
02:40:52,352 --> 02:40:58,233
But I knew who it was.

1972
02:41:03,196 --> 02:41:05,365
Nobody believed me.

1973
02:41:05,866 --> 02:41:08,285
But I knew you'd come back.

1974
02:41:10,871 --> 02:41:12,080
How?

1975
02:41:14,082 --> 02:41:17,210
Because my dad promised me.

1976
02:41:23,258 --> 02:41:25,260
Well, I'm here now, Murph.

1977
02:41:26,553 --> 02:41:27,888
I'm here.

1978
02:41:29,347 --> 02:41:30,682
No.

1979
02:41:32,767 --> 02:41:36,897
No parent should have to watch
their own child die.

1980
02:41:39,816 --> 02:41:42,485
I have my kids here for me now.

1981
02:41:45,280 --> 02:41:46,781
You go.

1982
02:41:49,701 --> 02:41:51,203
Where?

1983
02:41:54,706 --> 02:41:56,291
Brand.

1984
02:42:06,134 --> 02:42:07,761
She's out there...

1985
02:42:14,184 --> 02:42:15,936
...setting up camp.

1986
02:42:42,420 --> 02:42:44,130
Alone...

1987
02:42:45,298 --> 02:42:47,968
...in a strange galaxy.

1988
02:42:58,853 --> 02:43:03,525
Maybe right now
she's settling in for the long nap...

1989
02:43:21,876 --> 02:43:24,713
...by the light of our new sun...

1990
02:43:40,186 --> 02:43:42,230
...in our new home.

1991
02:48:59,505 --> 02:49:01,507
