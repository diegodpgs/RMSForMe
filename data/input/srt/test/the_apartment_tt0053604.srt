1
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,186
On November 1, 1959, the population
of New York City was 8,042,783.

2
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:40,304
If you laid them all end to end, figuring
an average height of 5 feet 6 and half inches,...

3
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:44,309
..they would reach from Times Square
to the outskirts of Karachi, Pakistan.

4
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,660
I know facts like this because I work for
an insurance company, Consolidated Life.

5
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:51,220
We're one of the top five companies
in the country.

6
00:01:51,347 --> 00:01:54,975
Our home office has 31,259 employees,...

7
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:59,254
..which is more than the entire population
of, uh... Natchez, Mississippi.

8
00:01:59,382 --> 00:02:02,259
I work on the 19th floor.
Ordinary Policy Department,...

9
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,336
..Premium Accounting Division,
Section W, desk number 861.

10
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:11,293
My name is CC Baxter: C for Calvin, C for
Clifford. But most people call me Bud.

11
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:16,362
I've worked here three years, ten months,
and my take-home pay is $94.70 a week.

12
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:29,237
The hours in our department
are 8.50 to 5.20.

13
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:31,319
(Bell)

14
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:38,755
They're staggered by floor so 16 elevators
can handle the 31,259 employees...

15
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,234
..without a serious traffic jam.

16
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:46,306
As for myself, I very often stay on at the
office and work for an extra hour or two,...

17
00:02:46,436 --> 00:02:48,425
..especially when the weather is bad.

18
00:02:48,555 --> 00:02:51,988
It's not that I'm overly ambitious.
It's just a way of killing time...

19
00:02:52,114 --> 00:02:54,704
..until it's all right for me to go home.

20
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,138
You see, I have this little problem
with my apartment.

21
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:02,783
I live in the West 60s,
just half a block from Central Park.

22
00:03:02,906 --> 00:03:05,941
My rent is $85 a month.
It used to be $80 until last July...

23
00:03:06,065 --> 00:03:09,815
..when Mrs. Lieberman, the landlady,
put in a second-hand air conditioner.

24
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:15,377
It's a real nice apartment. Nothing fancy,
but kind of cozy. Just right for a bachelor.

25
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,808
The only problem is
I can't always get in when I want to.

26
00:03:18,938 --> 00:03:21,291
(Latin-beat dance music)

27
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:28,327
(Woman hums along to music)

28
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,204
Cut it out, Sylvia.
We've gotta get out of here.

29
00:03:35,328 --> 00:03:38,238
What's the panic?
I'm gonna have another martini.

30
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:40,434
Please, Sylvia. It's a quarter of nine.

31
00:03:40,564 --> 00:03:43,759
First you can't wait to get me here
and then it's rush, rush, rush.

32
00:03:43,884 --> 00:03:46,952
- Makes a person feel cheap.
- Sweetie, it's not that.

33
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,752
But I promised the guy
I'd be outta here by eight.

34
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:55,269
- What guy? Whose apartment is this?
- Some schnook that works in the office.

35
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:10,496
- Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
- Mrs. Lieberman.

36
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:15,380
Some weather we're having. Must be from
all that meshugaas at Cape Canaveral.

37
00:04:16,664 --> 00:04:21,176
- You're locked out of your apartment?
- No, no. Just waiting for a friend.

38
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:24,930
- Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
- Good night, Mr. Baxter.

39
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,688
- Where do you live?
- I told you. With my mother.

40
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:47,878
- Where does she live?
- 179th Street, in the Bronx.

41
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:52,794
- All right. I'll take you to the subway.
- Like hell you will! You'll buy me a cab.

42
00:04:52,923 --> 00:04:56,675
- Why do all you dames live in the Bronx?
- You bring other girls up here?

43
00:04:56,802 --> 00:04:59,553
Certainly not. I'm a happily married man.

44
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:40,247
- Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
- Something's the matter?

45
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:44,286
Uh, no. I... seem to have
dropped my key. Ah, here it is.

46
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:46,802
Such a racket I heard in your place.

47
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:48,966
Maybe you had burglars?

48
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,367
Don't worry about that. There's nothing in
here anybody'd wanna steal. Good night.

49
00:06:23,311 --> 00:06:25,265
(Doorbell)

50
00:06:30,747 --> 00:06:35,101
Sorry to bother you, Buddy-boy,
but the little lady forgot her galoshes.

51
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:38,579
Mr. Kirkeby, you were supposed
to be outta here by eight.

52
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:43,093
I know, but those things don't always
run on schedule like a Greyhound bus.

53
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:45,777
I don't mind in the summer,
but on a rainy night...

54
00:06:45,898 --> 00:06:48,457
- I haven't had any dinner yet.
- Sure, sure.

55
00:06:48,578 --> 00:06:50,532
Oh!

56
00:06:50,895 --> 00:06:53,930
I put in a good word for you
with Sheldrake in Personnel.

57
00:06:54,054 --> 00:06:55,566
- Mr. Sheldrake?
- That's right.

58
00:06:55,693 --> 00:06:59,478
We discussed manpower promotion-wise.
I told him you're a bright boy.

59
00:06:59,612 --> 00:07:03,567
They're always on the lookout for
young executives. You're on your way up.

60
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:07,394
- And you're also out of liquor.
- Mr. Eichelberger, Mortgage and Loans...

61
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:11,803
- ..last night he had a Halloween party.
- Lay in some vodka and vermouth for me.

62
00:07:11,925 --> 00:07:16,040
- You still owe me for the last two bottles.
- I'll pay you on Friday.

63
00:07:16,162 --> 00:07:21,186
Oh, and whatever happened to those little
cheese crackers you used to have?

64
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,274
Cheese crackers?

65
00:08:02,056 --> 00:08:04,009
Cheers.

66
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,467
- Good evening, Baxter.
- Hi, Doc. Had a late call?

67
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,067
Yeah. Some clown at Schrafft's ate
a club sandwich - including the toothpick.

68
00:08:30,035 --> 00:08:32,595
- Well, good night, Doc.
- Say, Baxter.

69
00:08:32,714 --> 00:08:36,387
The way you're beltin' that stuff,
you must have cast-iron kidneys.

70
00:08:36,512 --> 00:08:40,549
That's not me. Just once in a while
I have a few people in for a drink.

71
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,626
As a matter of fact, you must be
an iron man all around.

72
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:46,897
From what I hear through the walls,
you're at it every night.

73
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:51,301
- I'm sorry if it gets noisy.
- And sometimes there's a double-header.

74
00:08:52,023 --> 00:08:55,296
- (Tuts) A nebbish like you.
- Yeah. Well, I'll see you, Doc.

75
00:08:55,421 --> 00:08:59,014
You know, I'm doing some research
at the Columbia Medical Center.

76
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,333
- Could you do us a favor?
- Me?

77
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:05,131
When you make out your will -
and the way you're going, you should -

78
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:09,166
would you mind leaving
your body to the university?

79
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:13,410
My body? I'm afraid you guys'd
be disappointed. Good night, Doc.

80
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,685
Slow down, kid.

81
00:09:53,628 --> 00:09:55,582
Oh, for heaven...

82
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:07,177
From the world's greatest library
of film classics, we proudly present...

83
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,606
..Greta Garbo, John Barrymore,...

84
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:13,694
..Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery
and Lionel Barrymore...

85
00:10:13,816 --> 00:10:16,453
..in "Grand Hotel".

86
00:10:17,214 --> 00:10:19,646
But first, a word from our sponsor.

87
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:23,921
If you smoke the modern way,
don't be fooled by phony filter claims.

88
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:50,546
(Bugle: cavalry charge)

89
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:56,465
And now, "Grand Hotel"...

90
00:10:56,592 --> 00:10:59,262
..starring Greta Garbo, John Barrymore,...

91
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,777
..Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery
and Lionel Barrymore.

92
00:11:03,468 --> 00:11:07,059
But first, a word
from our alternate sponsor.

93
00:11:07,184 --> 00:11:10,698
Friends, do you have wobbly dentures?

94
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:26,291
(Phone rings)

95
00:11:36,514 --> 00:11:38,231
- Hello.
- Hiya, Buddy-boy.

96
00:11:38,354 --> 00:11:42,027
I'm in this bar on 61st Street
and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.

97
00:11:42,153 --> 00:11:44,584
That's very nice of you but... who is this?

98
00:11:44,711 --> 00:11:47,097
Dobisch. Joe Dobisch, in Administration.

99
00:11:47,229 --> 00:11:50,855
- Oh, yeah. I didn't recognize your voice.
- That's OK, Buddy-boy.

100
00:11:50,987 --> 00:11:55,341
Like I was saying, I'm in this joint
on 61st and I think I got lucky.

101
00:11:56,503 --> 00:12:00,335
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch. I like to help
you fellas out, but it's sort of late.

102
00:12:00,462 --> 00:12:04,611
- Why don't we make it some other time?
- Listen, kid. I can't pass this up.

103
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,330
She looks like Marilyn Monroe.

104
00:12:07,457 --> 00:12:11,527
I'm already in bed. And I took a sleeping
pill. So I'm afraid the answer is no.

105
00:12:12,055 --> 00:12:16,012
We're doing the monthly efficiency rating.
I'm putting you in the top ten.

106
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:18,282
You don't wanna
louse yourself up, do you?

107
00:12:18,411 --> 00:12:22,958
No. But how can I be efficient in the
office if I don't get enough sleep at night?

108
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:27,044
It's only eleven, and I just
want the place for 45 minutes.

109
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:32,001
I'm getting lonely.
Who are you talking to, anyway?

110
00:12:32,122 --> 00:12:35,956
- My mother.
- Oh, that's sweet. That's real sweet.

111
00:12:36,562 --> 00:12:38,118
Ooh!

112
00:12:39,438 --> 00:12:42,155
Make it 30 minutes.
What do you say, Bud, huh?

113
00:12:42,718 --> 00:12:45,913
I'm all out of liquor,
there's no clean glasses...

114
00:12:46,036 --> 00:12:49,548
- There's no cheese crackers. No nothin'.
- Let me worry about that.

115
00:12:49,673 --> 00:12:52,391
Just leave the key under the mat
and clear out.

116
00:12:52,512 --> 00:12:54,465
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.

117
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,902
Anything you say, Mr. Dobisch

118
00:12:58,707 --> 00:13:02,302
No trouble at all, Mr. Dobisch
Be my guest!

119
00:13:03,226 --> 00:13:05,977
We never close at Buddy-boy's.

120
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:11,538
"Looks like Marilyn Monroe"!

121
00:13:53,197 --> 00:13:55,994
- This the place?
- Yeah.

122
00:13:56,116 --> 00:13:57,992
- How much?
- 70 cents.

123
00:13:58,115 --> 00:14:00,069
Get the money, will you?

124
00:14:01,711 --> 00:14:03,667
Watch those stingers!

125
00:14:04,992 --> 00:14:06,944
- Give him a buck.
- Thanks, lady.

126
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:10,742
Put it back, honey!

127
00:14:12,627 --> 00:14:14,501
Attagirl.

128
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:17,661
- Are you sure this is a good idea?
- Can't think of a better one.

129
00:14:17,784 --> 00:14:19,976
Barging in on your mother so late at night.

130
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,537
Don't worry about the old lady. One
squawk from her and she's out of a job.

131
00:14:32,495 --> 00:14:34,448
(Door closes)

132
00:14:39,972 --> 00:14:41,925
Get the key, will you?

133
00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:44,763
Not there! Under the mat.

134
00:14:44,887 --> 00:14:47,479
- Under the mat?
- Yeah. Come on.

135
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:50,558
Open up. We haven't got all night.

136
00:14:53,843 --> 00:14:57,195
- This is your mother's apartment?
- That's right.

137
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,595
(Drunken giggling)

138
00:15:06,756 --> 00:15:08,710
(Latin-beat dance music)

139
00:15:10,393 --> 00:15:12,780
Mildred! He's at it again!

140
00:16:00,883 --> 00:16:03,192
- Morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
- How are you, Baxter?

141
00:16:03,323 --> 00:16:07,074
- They keeping you busy these days?
- Yes, sir. They are indeed.

142
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:10,714
Good morning, Mr. Kessel, Miss Robinson,
Mr. Williams, Miss Livingston.

143
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:13,556
Good morning, Mr. McKellway,
Mrs. Schubert, Mr. Davis.

144
00:16:13,677 --> 00:16:16,267
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
Good morning, Mr. Baxter.

145
00:16:16,396 --> 00:16:19,113
- Morning, Miss Kubelik.
- That's all. Take it away.

146
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:21,588
Watch the door, please. Blasting off.

147
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:28,225
- What did you do to your hair?
- It made me nervous so I chopped it off.

148
00:16:28,349 --> 00:16:31,497
- Big mistake, huh?
- No. I sort of like it. (Snuffles)

149
00:16:31,626 --> 00:16:34,218
- You got a lulu.
- Yeah. Better not get too close.

150
00:16:34,345 --> 00:16:36,176
- I never catch colds.
- Really?

151
00:16:36,305 --> 00:16:39,020
I was reading some sickness
and accident claims figures.

152
00:16:39,142 --> 00:16:43,576
The average New Yorker aged between
20 and 50 has two and a half colds a year.

153
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:46,053
- That makes me feel just terrible.
- Why?

154
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:50,250
If I have no colds a year, some poor slob
must have five colds a year.

155
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:53,811
- Yeah. It's me.
- You shoulda stayed in bed this morning.

156
00:16:53,934 --> 00:16:56,287
I shoulda stayed in bed last night.

157
00:16:57,052 --> 00:16:58,530
19!

158
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:03,287
Watch your step.

159
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:05,875
- And watch your hands, Mr. Kirkeby!
- Pardon?

160
00:17:06,007 --> 00:17:09,360
One of these days I'm gonna
shut these doors on you and...

161
00:17:11,525 --> 00:17:13,196
20 next!

162
00:17:13,841 --> 00:17:17,470
That Kubelik. Boy, would I like
to get her on a slow elevator to China!

163
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:21,033
- She's the best operator in the building.
- I'm pretty good myself.

164
00:17:21,158 --> 00:17:24,114
- But she won't give me a date.
- Maybe it's your approach.

165
00:17:24,237 --> 00:17:27,863
A lot of guys around here have tried
all kinds of approaches. No dice.

166
00:17:27,994 --> 00:17:31,985
- What's she trying to prove?
- She could just be a nice respectable girl.

167
00:17:32,112 --> 00:17:34,500
Listen to him! Little Lord Fauntleroy.

168
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:41,222
(Bell)

169
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:03,561
Hello. Mr. Dobisch?
This is Baxter on the 19th floor.

170
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:05,357
Oh, Buddy-boy!

171
00:18:05,486 --> 00:18:10,237
I was just about to call you. I'm sorry
about that mess on the living room wall.

172
00:18:10,364 --> 00:18:14,352
My friend kept insisting Picasso was
a bum, so she started to do that mural.

173
00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:16,836
It's not Picasso I'm calling about.

174
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:21,427
It's the key to my apartment.
You're supposed to leave it under the mat.

175
00:18:21,716 --> 00:18:24,592
But I did. I distinctly
remember putting it there.

176
00:18:24,795 --> 00:18:27,669
Oh, I found the key all right.
Only it's the wrong key!

177
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:33,785
It is? No wonder I couldn't get into
the executive washroom this morning.

178
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:36,263
And I couldn't get into my apartment!

179
00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:40,173
So at 4am I gotta wake up the landlady
and give her a whole song and dance.

180
00:18:40,305 --> 00:18:43,421
That's a shame.
I'll send the key right down.

181
00:18:43,545 --> 00:18:45,419
And about your promotion.

182
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:48,612
I'll send that efficiency report
to Mr. Sheldrake in Personnel.

183
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,095
You may hear from him
before the day's over.

184
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,173
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.

185
00:18:56,018 --> 00:18:57,972
(Coughs)

186
00:19:19,043 --> 00:19:20,953
From Mr. Dobisch.

187
00:19:21,082 --> 00:19:23,037
Wait.

188
00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:35,230
For Mr. Dobisch.

189
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:43,625
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

190
00:19:56,222 --> 00:19:57,621
(Phone rings)

191
00:19:57,742 --> 00:19:59,492
Vanderhof. Public Relations.

192
00:19:59,622 --> 00:20:01,575
Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.

193
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:04,848
All right, Miss Finch.
Type up what we got so far.

194
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,569
Look, I've got you down for tonight,...

195
00:20:09,695 --> 00:20:12,891
..but I'll be using the place myself,
so I'll have to cancel.

196
00:20:13,014 --> 00:20:15,764
But it's her birthday.
I already ordered the cake.

197
00:20:15,891 --> 00:20:20,837
But I am sick. I got a terrible cold and a
fever. I got to go to bed right after work.

198
00:20:20,968 --> 00:20:24,561
If you got a cold, you go to a Turkish bath.
Spend the night. Sweat it out.

199
00:20:24,686 --> 00:20:28,676
That's how you get pneumonia. If I got
pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month.

200
00:20:28,804 --> 00:20:33,033
OK. You made your point. We'll just
have to do it next Wednesday night.

201
00:20:33,162 --> 00:20:38,516
- It's the only night I can get away.
- Wednesday, Wednesday... Wednesday.

202
00:20:39,998 --> 00:20:42,270
I got somebody penciled in.

203
00:20:42,396 --> 00:20:45,147
Let me see what I can do.
I'll get back to you.

204
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,025
- Mr. Eichelberger.
- Oh, yes, Baxter. What's your problem?

205
00:21:00,786 --> 00:21:05,697
Wednesday is out? Oh, that throws
a little monkey wrench into my agenda.

206
00:21:05,823 --> 00:21:08,971
Thursday? No,
I'm all tied up on Thursday.

207
00:21:10,301 --> 00:21:13,415
Let's schedule that, uh...
meeting for Friday.

208
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,494
Friday.

209
00:21:16,377 --> 00:21:19,014
Let me see what I can do.
I'll get back to you.

210
00:21:24,453 --> 00:21:29,159
Premium-wise and billing-wise, we are 18
per cent ahead of last year October-wise.

211
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,245
(Phone rings)

212
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:34,724
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?

213
00:21:34,846 --> 00:21:37,962
Instead of Friday, could you
possibly switch to Thursday?

214
00:21:38,085 --> 00:21:40,755
You'd be doing me a great favor.

215
00:21:41,163 --> 00:21:43,516
Let me check. I'll get back to you.

216
00:21:45,201 --> 00:21:47,632
Consolidated Life. I'll connect you.

217
00:21:47,758 --> 00:21:49,634
Sylvia, it's for you.

218
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:51,475
Yeah?

219
00:21:51,597 --> 00:21:53,186
Oh, hello.

220
00:21:53,316 --> 00:21:56,509
Sure I got home all right.
You owe me 45 cents.

221
00:21:56,634 --> 00:22:00,181
Look, Sylvia. Instead of Friday,
could we make it Thursday night?

222
00:22:00,472 --> 00:22:05,337
Thursday?! Well, that's
The Untouchables with Bob Stack!

223
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:07,624
Bob who?

224
00:22:08,068 --> 00:22:11,613
All right, so we'll watch it
at the apartment. Big deal!

225
00:22:15,623 --> 00:22:18,136
Hello, Baxter? It's OK for Thursday.

226
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,735
Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.

227
00:22:29,895 --> 00:22:32,361
Mr. Eichelberger, it's OK for Friday.

228
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:42,321
Mr. Vanderhof? OK for Wednesday.

229
00:22:52,802 --> 00:22:54,631
All right. I'll tell him.

230
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:58,435
Hey, Baxter, that was Personnel.
Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.

231
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,310
She's been trying to reach you for the last
20 minutes. They want you upstairs.

232
00:23:04,156 --> 00:23:08,828
- Are you getting promoted? Or fired?
- Would you care to make a small wager?

233
00:23:08,953 --> 00:23:12,990
- I've been here twice as long as you but...
- Let's say a dollar?

234
00:23:13,111 --> 00:23:14,622
It's a bet!

235
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:30,348
- Going up?
- Oh! Excuse me.

236
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:36,308
27, please. Drive carefully. You're carrying
precious cargo. I mean manpower-wise.

237
00:23:36,713 --> 00:23:37,862
27.

238
00:23:37,992 --> 00:23:41,779
You may not realize it, but I am
in the top ten, efficiency-wise,...

239
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,581
..and this may be the day promotion-wise.

240
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:47,267
You're beginning to sound
like Mr. Kirkeby already.

241
00:23:47,387 --> 00:23:51,264
- Why not, as they're kicking me upstairs?
- Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

242
00:23:51,385 --> 00:23:54,932
You know, you're the only one
who takes his hat off in the elevator.

243
00:23:55,063 --> 00:23:57,255
Something happens to men in elevators.

244
00:23:57,382 --> 00:24:00,257
It's the change of altitude.
The blood rushes to their head.

245
00:24:00,379 --> 00:24:03,449
- I could tell you stories...
- I'd love to hear 'em.

246
00:24:03,578 --> 00:24:06,044
We could have lunch
in the cafeteria sometime.

247
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,051
Or some evening, after work?

248
00:24:08,174 --> 00:24:10,244
- 27.
- Oh.

249
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,931
- I hope everything goes all right.
- I hope so.

250
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:15,689
They would call me today,
what with my cold.

251
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,164
- How do I look?
- Fine. Wait.

252
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:20,520
Thank you.

253
00:24:20,648 --> 00:24:25,275
I noticed, when you were still on the
local elevator, you always wore a flower.

254
00:24:25,406 --> 00:24:27,794
Good luck. And wipe your nose.

255
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:46,183
CC Baxter, Ordinary Premium Accounting.
Mr. Sheldrake called me.

256
00:24:46,315 --> 00:24:48,984
I called you. That is,
I tried to for 20 minutes.

257
00:24:49,111 --> 00:24:51,067
- I'm sorry.
- Go on in.

258
00:25:02,305 --> 00:25:03,817
- Baxter?
- Yes, sir.

259
00:25:03,945 --> 00:25:05,898
Come in, come in.

260
00:25:06,822 --> 00:25:09,651
I was sort of wondering
what you looked like, Baxter.

261
00:25:09,778 --> 00:25:12,167
- Sit down.
- Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

262
00:25:13,618 --> 00:25:16,255
Been hearing some nice things about you.

263
00:25:16,376 --> 00:25:19,333
Mr. Dobisch says you're loyal,
cooperative, resourceful.

264
00:25:19,455 --> 00:25:23,649
- Mr. Dobisch said that?
- Mr. Kirkeby tells me you often work late...

265
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:26,922
- ..without overtime.
- You know how it is. Things pile up.

266
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,078
Mr. Vanderhof in Public Relations and
Mr. Eichelberger in Mortgage and Loans...

267
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:34,005
..would both like you
transferred to their departments.

268
00:25:34,127 --> 00:25:35,955
Very flattering.

269
00:25:37,005 --> 00:25:41,075
Tell me, Baxter. Just what is it
that makes you so popular?

270
00:25:41,202 --> 00:25:44,477
- I don't know.
- Think.

271
00:25:49,518 --> 00:25:53,394
- Would you mind repeating the question?
- Look, Baxter. I'm not stupid.

272
00:25:53,516 --> 00:25:57,904
I know everything that goes on
in this building every day of the year.

273
00:25:58,033 --> 00:25:59,430
You do?

274
00:25:59,551 --> 00:26:03,906
In 1957 we had an employee here,
name of Fowler. He was very popular too.

275
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,621
It turned out
he was running a bookie joint,...

276
00:26:06,747 --> 00:26:10,136
..tying up our switchboard, using
our IBM machines to figure the odds.

277
00:26:10,267 --> 00:26:14,381
The day before the Kentucky Derby I
called in the vice squad, who raided him.

278
00:26:14,503 --> 00:26:16,457
- The vice squad?
- That's right.

279
00:26:16,581 --> 00:26:19,731
What's that got to do with me?
I'm not running any bookie joint.

280
00:26:19,862 --> 00:26:23,214
- Just what kind of joint are you running?
- Sir?

281
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:28,205
A key is floating around from Kirkeby
to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch.

282
00:26:28,335 --> 00:26:30,245
It's the key to a certain apartment.

283
00:26:30,373 --> 00:26:33,649
- Know who that apartment belongs to?
- Who?

284
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:37,002
Loyal, resourceful, cooperative CC Baxter.

285
00:26:39,449 --> 00:26:41,803
- Oh.
- Are you going to deny it?

286
00:26:42,887 --> 00:26:46,560
No. I'm not going to deny it.
If you'd just let me explain.

287
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:48,956
You'd better.

288
00:26:49,085 --> 00:26:51,039
Well,...

289
00:26:51,683 --> 00:26:56,276
..about a year ago, I was going to night
school, studying advanced accounting.

290
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:01,186
One of the guys in our department lives
in Jersey had to go to a banquet in town.

291
00:27:01,317 --> 00:27:05,546
He needed someplace to change
into a tuxedo, so I gave him the key.

292
00:27:05,673 --> 00:27:11,382
Word must've gotten out because all sorts
of guys were suddenly going to banquets.

293
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:16,183
You give the key to one guy, you can't
say no to another. It all got out of hand.

294
00:27:19,066 --> 00:27:22,341
Baxter, an insurance company
is founded on public trust.

295
00:27:22,465 --> 00:27:25,614
Any employee who conducts himself
in a manner unbecoming...

296
00:27:25,743 --> 00:27:28,652
How many charter members
are there in this little club?

297
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:32,408
Just those four. Out of a total of 31,259.

298
00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:36,449
So actually we can be very proud
of our personnel... percentage-wise.

299
00:27:36,577 --> 00:27:41,044
That's not the point. Four rotten apples
in a barrel, however large the barrel...

300
00:27:41,173 --> 00:27:44,244
- Do you realize if this ever leaked out...
- It won't!

301
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:49,159
Believe me. Never again. Nobody
is gonna use my apartment from now on.

302
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:51,848
- Where is your apartment?
- West 67th Street.

303
00:27:51,968 --> 00:27:57,242
You have no idea what I go through with
the neighbors, the landlady and the key.

304
00:27:57,364 --> 00:27:59,318
How do you work it with the key?

305
00:27:59,442 --> 00:28:04,115
I slip it to 'em in the office and they leave
it under a mat. Never again. I promise.

306
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,196
(Intercom buzzer)

307
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,430
- Yes, Miss Olsen?
- Mrs. Sheldrake, returning your call. On 2.

308
00:28:15,754 --> 00:28:17,788
(Sheldrake) Yes, dear. Where were you?

309
00:28:18,553 --> 00:28:23,145
You had to take Tommy to the dentist?
No cavities? Good. Hold it, dear.

310
00:28:23,271 --> 00:28:26,179
- Where are you going, Baxter?
- I don't wanna intrude.

311
00:28:26,308 --> 00:28:29,504
- Since this is straightened out...
- I'm not through with you yet.

312
00:28:29,628 --> 00:28:31,740
I won't be home for dinner tonight.

313
00:28:31,865 --> 00:28:35,696
The branch manager from Kansas City
is in town. I'm taking him to the theatre.

314
00:28:35,823 --> 00:28:37,574
Music Man. What else?

315
00:28:37,702 --> 00:28:40,132
No, don't wait up for me,
darling. Goodbye.

316
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,574
Tell me, Baxter.
Have you seen Music Man?

317
00:28:44,698 --> 00:28:47,210
Not yet. I hear it's one swell show.

318
00:28:47,337 --> 00:28:49,485
How would you like to go tonight?

319
00:28:49,615 --> 00:28:53,730
You and me? I thought you were taking
the branch manager from Kansas City.

320
00:28:53,852 --> 00:28:57,000
No, I have other plans.
You can have both tickets.

321
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,085
Well... that's very kind of you.

322
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:03,085
But I'm not feeling well. I've got
this cold. I'm gonna go right home.

323
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:06,640
Baxter, you're not reading me.
I told you I have plans.

324
00:29:07,044 --> 00:29:10,116
So do I. I'm gonna take
four aspirins, get into bed.

325
00:29:10,244 --> 00:29:12,392
So give the tickets to somebody else.

326
00:29:12,803 --> 00:29:17,269
Look, Baxter. I'm not just giving
these tickets. I wanna swap them.

327
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:19,467
Swap 'em? For what?

328
00:29:21,675 --> 00:29:26,303
It also says here that you are
alert, astute and quite imaginative.

329
00:29:27,514 --> 00:29:29,342
Oh?

330
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,143
Oh...

331
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:49,139
That's good thinking, Baxter. There's
gonna be a shift in personnel next month.

332
00:29:49,261 --> 00:29:52,967
And as far as I'm concerned,
you are executive material.

333
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:55,452
- I am?
- Now put down the key.

334
00:29:58,495 --> 00:30:00,450
And put down the address.

335
00:30:02,373 --> 00:30:07,321
It's on the second floor. There's no name
over the door. It just says apartment 2A.

336
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,159
- It's that cold.
- Relax, Baxter.

337
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,244
Yes, thank you, sir.

338
00:30:14,207 --> 00:30:17,164
You will be careful with
the record player? Shh.

339
00:30:17,286 --> 00:30:19,237
Oh, and about the liquor.

340
00:30:19,364 --> 00:30:23,753
I ordered some this morning.
I don't know when they'll deliver it.

341
00:30:24,761 --> 00:30:27,670
- This is going to be our little secret.
- Of course.

342
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,357
- You know how people talk.
- Don't worry about that.

343
00:30:30,477 --> 00:30:34,069
- Not that I have anything to hide.
- No! Anyway, it's none of my business.

344
00:30:34,195 --> 00:30:37,902
Four apples, five apples.
What's the difference?

345
00:30:38,034 --> 00:30:39,987
Percentage-wise.

346
00:30:40,112 --> 00:30:42,579
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.

347
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,664
You too, sir.

348
00:31:15,372 --> 00:31:19,158
So I figure, a man in his position,
he'll take me to EI Morocco, maybe 21.

349
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:23,643
Instead he takes me to Hamburger
Heaven and some schnook's apartment.

350
00:31:28,406 --> 00:31:30,358
- Good night.
- Good night.

351
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:34,556
Oh! Miss Kubelik?

352
00:31:34,682 --> 00:31:37,716
I've been waiting for you.
I almost didn't recognize you.

353
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:40,873
This is the first time
I've seen you in civilian clothes.

354
00:31:40,997 --> 00:31:43,191
- How'd it go on the 27th floor?
- Great.

355
00:31:43,315 --> 00:31:45,621
- Look, have you seen The Music Man?
- No.

356
00:31:45,754 --> 00:31:47,310
- Would you like to?
- Sure.

357
00:31:47,433 --> 00:31:49,662
We could get a bite to eat first,
and then go.

358
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:51,305
- Oh, you mean tonight?
- Yeah.

359
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:54,388
- I'm sorry, I can't. I'm meeting somebody.
- Oh.

360
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,943
- You mean... Like a girlfriend?
- No. Like a man.

361
00:31:58,068 --> 00:32:02,456
I wasn't trying to be personal. The fellas
in the office were wondering if you ever...

362
00:32:02,585 --> 00:32:04,462
You tell 'em now and then.

363
00:32:04,585 --> 00:32:08,733
This date, is it... just a date?
Or is it something serious?

364
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:12,169
Well, it used to be serious.
At least, I was. But he wasn't.

365
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:14,573
So now the whole thing is
more or less kaput.

366
00:32:14,698 --> 00:32:17,210
- In that case, couldn't you...
- I'm afraid not.

367
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:21,291
I promised I'd have a drink with him.
He's been calling me all week.

368
00:32:21,934 --> 00:32:24,083
I understand.

369
00:32:24,213 --> 00:32:28,566
Well, it was just an idea. I hate
to see a theatre ticket go to waste.

370
00:32:28,689 --> 00:32:31,645
- What time does the show go on?
- 8.30.

371
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:34,042
Well, I could meet you at the theatre.

372
00:32:34,168 --> 00:32:38,076
That's wonderful!
It's the Majestic on 44th Street.

373
00:32:38,205 --> 00:32:40,000
I'll meet you in the lobby.

374
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,478
You know, I felt so lousy
this morning. Had 101 fever.

375
00:32:43,601 --> 00:32:46,954
Now along comes my promotion
and us - 11th row centre.

376
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:48,955
And you said I should've stayed in bed.

377
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:51,146
- How is your cold?
- What cold?

378
00:32:51,277 --> 00:32:55,154
After the show we could go out
on the town. (Hums dance tune)

379
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:57,946
- I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
- So I see.

380
00:32:58,073 --> 00:33:00,950
There's a great band
at EI Chico, in the Village.

381
00:33:01,072 --> 00:33:04,458
- Around the corner from where you live.
- Sounds good.

382
00:33:04,588 --> 00:33:09,024
- How do you know where I live?
- Oh, I... even know who you live with.

383
00:33:09,147 --> 00:33:11,102
Your sister and brother-in-law.

384
00:33:11,226 --> 00:33:15,010
I know when you were born and where.
I know all sorts of things about you.

385
00:33:15,144 --> 00:33:16,496
How come?

386
00:33:16,623 --> 00:33:21,134
A couple of months ago I looked up
your card in the group insurance file.

387
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:25,012
I know your height and your weight
and your social security number.

388
00:33:25,138 --> 00:33:28,889
You had mumps and measles
and you had your appendix out.

389
00:33:29,815 --> 00:33:32,850
Don't mention the appendix
to the fellas in the office.

390
00:33:32,974 --> 00:33:37,521
I wouldn't want 'em to get the wrong idea
about how you found out. Bye.

391
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:42,683
8.30!

392
00:34:06,595 --> 00:34:09,231
(Light music)

393
00:34:16,548 --> 00:34:19,504
(Plays "Jealous Lover")

394
00:34:29,582 --> 00:34:33,491
- Good evening, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Please, Fran. Not so loud.

395
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:35,972
Still afraid someone
might see us together?

396
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:39,566
- Let me take your coat.
- No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.

397
00:34:40,855 --> 00:34:43,926
- Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
- It's on the way.

398
00:34:44,973 --> 00:34:48,280
- I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
- That's right.

399
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:51,604
- You know I liked it better long.
- I know.

400
00:34:51,728 --> 00:34:54,480
You want a lock to carry in your wallet?

401
00:34:55,206 --> 00:34:58,594
- Evening, lady. Nice to see you again.
- Thank you.

402
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:01,877
How long has it been, Fran? A month?

403
00:35:02,002 --> 00:35:04,561
Six weeks. But who's counting?

404
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,555
I missed you.

405
00:35:09,998 --> 00:35:11,952
Like old times.

406
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:14,668
Same booth. Same song.

407
00:35:15,515 --> 00:35:19,470
- It's been hell.
- Same sauce. Sweet-and-sour.

408
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:24,982
You don't know what it's like,
next to you in that elevator.

409
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:28,179
"Good morning, Miss Kubelik."
"Good night, Mr. Sheldrake."

410
00:35:28,307 --> 00:35:30,739
I'm still crazy about you, Fran.

411
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:36,142
Let's not start on that again, Jeff. Please?
I'm just beginning to get over it.

412
00:35:37,421 --> 00:35:39,775
I don't believe you.

413
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,814
Look, Jeff. We had two
wonderful months this summer.

414
00:35:43,937 --> 00:35:46,690
But that was it. Happens all the time.

415
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:50,772
Wife and kids go away to the country and
the boss has a fling with his secretary,...

416
00:35:50,894 --> 00:35:53,531
..or the manicurist, or the elevator girl.

417
00:35:53,653 --> 00:35:56,927
Come September,
the picnic's over. Goodbye.

418
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:00,928
The kids go back to school,
the boss goes back to the wife,...

419
00:36:01,049 --> 00:36:03,003
..and the girl...

420
00:36:04,286 --> 00:36:07,163
They don't make these shrimp
like they used to.

421
00:36:10,204 --> 00:36:12,760
I never said goodbye, Fran.

422
00:36:14,242 --> 00:36:19,392
For a while there, you try kidding yourself
that you're going with an unmarried man.

423
00:36:19,518 --> 00:36:22,190
Then one day he keeps
looking at his watch...

424
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:24,829
..and asks you if any lipstick's showing,...

425
00:36:24,955 --> 00:36:28,308
..then rushes out to catch
the 7.14 to White Plains.

426
00:36:29,472 --> 00:36:32,905
So you fix yourself
a cup of instant coffee...

427
00:36:33,029 --> 00:36:36,624
..and you sit there
by yourself and you think,...

428
00:36:37,588 --> 00:36:40,736
..and it all begins to look so... ugly.

429
00:36:44,104 --> 00:36:47,776
How do you think I felt
riding home on that 7.14 train?

430
00:36:47,902 --> 00:36:51,939
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff?
What do you want from me?

431
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,014
I want you back, Fran.

432
00:36:54,138 --> 00:36:57,889
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake. I'm full up.
You'll have to take the next elevator.

433
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:01,767
You're not giving me a chance, Fran.
I have something to tell you.

434
00:37:01,893 --> 00:37:05,600
- Go ahead. Tell me.
- Not here. Can't we go someplace else?

435
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:08,449
- No. I have a date at 8.30.
- Oh?

436
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,483
- Important?
- Not very, but I'm gonna be there anyway.

437
00:37:12,609 --> 00:37:15,166
- You ready order dinner now?
- No. No dinner.

438
00:37:15,286 --> 00:37:17,673
Just bring us two more drinks, will you?

439
00:37:34,077 --> 00:37:35,508
(Coughs)

440
00:37:36,794 --> 00:37:39,546
Fran, do you remember
that last weekend we had?

441
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:44,346
Do I! That leaky boat you rented, and me
in a black negligee and a life preserver.

442
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:46,742
Do you remember what we talked about?

443
00:37:46,868 --> 00:37:50,336
- We talked about a lot of things.
- I mean about my getting a divorce.

444
00:37:50,465 --> 00:37:52,740
We didn't talk about it, Jeff. You did.

445
00:37:52,865 --> 00:37:54,820
You didn't believe me, did you?

446
00:37:54,945 --> 00:37:59,219
They got it on a long-playing record now.
"Music to String Her Along By."

447
00:37:59,341 --> 00:38:03,968
"My wife doesn't understand me. You're
the best thing that ever happened to me."

448
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,292
- That's enough, Fran.
- "Trust me, baby. We'll work it out."

449
00:38:07,415 --> 00:38:10,007
- You're not being funny.
- I wasn't trying.

450
00:38:10,536 --> 00:38:14,367
- Fran, just listen to me for a minute.
- All right. I'm sorry.

451
00:38:14,494 --> 00:38:19,359
I saw my lawyer this morning. I wanted
his advice about the best way to handle it.

452
00:38:19,491 --> 00:38:21,842
- Handle what?
- What do you think?

453
00:38:23,247 --> 00:38:27,556
Let's get something straight, Jeff.
I never asked you to leave your wife.

454
00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:30,322
Of course not. You had
nothing to do with it.

455
00:38:32,242 --> 00:38:34,277
Are you sure that's what you want?

456
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,748
I'm sure... if you'll just tell me
that you still love me.

457
00:38:41,837 --> 00:38:43,791
You know I do.

458
00:38:46,834 --> 00:38:48,391
Fran.

459
00:38:49,992 --> 00:38:51,788
(Woman laughs)

460
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,865
Jeff, darling...

461
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:02,983
It is getting crowded. Let's get out of here.

462
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,855
(Pianist plays "Jealous Lover")

463
00:39:34,047 --> 00:39:35,526
Taxi!

464
00:39:35,647 --> 00:39:39,079
- Jeff, I have that date, remember?
- But I love you, remember?

465
00:39:39,204 --> 00:39:41,717
- (Whistles)
- Where are we going?

466
00:39:41,843 --> 00:39:44,514
- Not back to that leaky boat?
- I promise.

467
00:39:48,878 --> 00:39:51,232
51 West 67th.

468
00:40:33,332 --> 00:40:35,286
Congratulations.

469
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:52,917
Would you mind? CC Baxter - that's me.

470
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:58,232
Thank you.

471
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,738
(Door opens)

472
00:41:12,869 --> 00:41:16,223
(Kirkeby) Hi, Buddy-boy.
Congratulations and all that jazz.

473
00:41:16,347 --> 00:41:19,701
- Hi, fellas.
- Well, you made it, just like we promised.

474
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:22,894
Quite an office.
Name on the door, rug on the floor.

475
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:27,537
Teamwork: that's what counts in this
organization. All for one and one for all.

476
00:41:27,661 --> 00:41:29,614
- Know what I mean?
- I have a vague idea.

477
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:32,774
Baxter, we're a little disappointed
in you, gratitude-wise.

478
00:41:32,898 --> 00:41:36,205
- Oh, I'm very grateful.
- Then why are you locking us out?

479
00:41:36,336 --> 00:41:41,725
Well, it's been sort of rough the past few
weeks, what with my cold and... Like that.

480
00:41:41,854 --> 00:41:44,570
We went to bat for you.
Now you won't play ball with us.

481
00:41:44,691 --> 00:41:48,840
After all, it's my apartment. It's
private property, not a public playground.

482
00:41:48,968 --> 00:41:53,038
So you got yourself a girl. That's OK
with us. But not every night in the week!

483
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:54,837
How selfish can you get?

484
00:41:54,966 --> 00:41:58,591
Last week I had to use my nephew's car
and take Sylvia to a drive-in in Jersey.

485
00:41:58,722 --> 00:42:01,633
I'm too old for that sort of thing -
I mean in a Volkswagen.

486
00:42:01,761 --> 00:42:04,875
I sympathize with you.
Believe me, I'm very sorry.

487
00:42:04,998 --> 00:42:08,194
- You'll be a lot sorrier.
- Are you threatening me?

488
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:11,275
Listen, Baxter. We made you
and we can break you.

489
00:42:12,475 --> 00:42:15,271
- Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Good morning, gentlemen.

490
00:42:15,394 --> 00:42:19,349
- Baxter, do you like your office?
- Yes, sir. I wanna thank you very much.

491
00:42:19,471 --> 00:42:22,268
Don't thank me.
Your friends here recommended you.

492
00:42:22,388 --> 00:42:26,016
- We just dropped by to wish him luck.
- We know you won't let us down.

493
00:42:26,147 --> 00:42:30,695
So long, fellas. Drop in any time.
The door is always open... to my office.

494
00:42:31,544 --> 00:42:33,533
I like the way you handled that, Baxter.

495
00:42:33,663 --> 00:42:36,128
- How does it feel to be an executive?
- Oh, fine.

496
00:42:36,261 --> 00:42:39,934
- I'll work hard to justify your confidence.
- I'm sure you will.

497
00:42:40,061 --> 00:42:44,653
About the apartment. Now that you've got
a raise, can't we afford a second key?

498
00:42:44,776 --> 00:42:47,084
- I guess so.
- You know my secretary, Miss Olsen?

499
00:42:47,216 --> 00:42:49,885
- Oh, yeah. Is she the lucky girl that...?
- Oh, no, no.

500
00:42:50,012 --> 00:42:55,083
I just meant that she's kind of a busybody,
and passing that key back and forth...

501
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:57,724
- Why take chances?
- You can't be too careful.

502
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:00,760
Oh, I... have something
I think belongs to you.

503
00:43:00,887 --> 00:43:03,318
- Me?
- I mean the young lady, whoever she is.

504
00:43:03,446 --> 00:43:06,083
- I found it when I got back last night.
- Oh. Thanks.

505
00:43:06,205 --> 00:43:09,558
The mirror is broken.
It was broken when I found it.

506
00:43:11,201 --> 00:43:13,919
- Yeah. She threw it at me.
- Sir?

507
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:16,426
You know how it is.
They always give you a bad time.

508
00:43:16,558 --> 00:43:17,592
Yeah, I know how it is.

509
00:43:17,718 --> 00:43:22,266
You see a girl every week for laughs and
they think you're gonna divorce your wife.

510
00:43:22,395 --> 00:43:25,463
- Now I ask you, is that fair?
- No, sir. It's very unfair.

511
00:43:25,592 --> 00:43:27,502
- Especially to your wife.
- Yeah.

512
00:43:27,912 --> 00:43:32,299
You know, Baxter, I envy you. A bachelor,
all the dames you want, no complications.

513
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:33,941
That's the life all right.

514
00:43:34,068 --> 00:43:36,262
- Put me down for Thursday again.
- Roger.

515
00:43:36,387 --> 00:43:38,535
And I'll get that other key.

516
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,966
- Merry Christmas. I'll connect you.
- Merry Christmas. Consolidated Life.

517
00:43:54,097 --> 00:43:56,006
Merry Christmas. I'm ringing.

518
00:43:56,136 --> 00:43:58,091
Yeah? Yeah?!

519
00:43:58,215 --> 00:43:59,282
Where?

520
00:43:59,413 --> 00:44:00,608
You bet!

521
00:44:00,733 --> 00:44:04,883
Somebody watch my line. There's
a swingin' party on the 19th floor!

522
00:44:07,129 --> 00:44:10,006
# Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh

523
00:44:10,128 --> 00:44:13,720
# Hey! Jingle bells,
jingle bells, jingle all the way

524
00:44:13,845 --> 00:44:16,993
# Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh

525
00:44:17,124 --> 00:44:19,078
(Singing continues)

526
00:44:32,475 --> 00:44:37,670
So I said to him "Never again. Either you
get yourself a bigger car or a smaller girl."

527
00:44:38,511 --> 00:44:40,467
Miss Kubelik? Miss...

528
00:44:40,712 --> 00:44:42,824
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

529
00:44:42,948 --> 00:44:45,905
- I thought you were avoiding me.
- What gave you that idea?

530
00:44:46,027 --> 00:44:49,654
In six weeks you've only been in my
elevator once, and you kept on your hat.

531
00:44:49,785 --> 00:44:53,093
As a matter of fact, I was rather hurt
that night you stood me up.

532
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:55,178
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.

533
00:44:55,302 --> 00:44:56,858
- I forgive you.
- You shouldn't.

534
00:44:56,981 --> 00:45:00,335
You couldn't help it. You can't
suddenly walk out on one man...

535
00:45:00,459 --> 00:45:02,608
..because you have a date
with another man.

536
00:45:02,739 --> 00:45:05,011
- You did the decent thing.
- Don't be too sure.

537
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:08,490
Just because I wear a uniform,
that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.

538
00:45:08,614 --> 00:45:13,162
A second administrative assistant has
to be a pretty good judge of character.

539
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:15,680
And as far as I'm concerned, you're tops.

540
00:45:15,811 --> 00:45:20,323
I mean decency-wise and... otherwise-wise.

541
00:45:20,448 --> 00:45:22,402
Cheers.

542
00:45:24,086 --> 00:45:26,313
- One more.
- I shouldn't drink while driving.

543
00:45:26,444 --> 00:45:31,356
You're so right. By the power vested
in me, I declare this elevator out of order.

544
00:45:31,481 --> 00:45:33,754
Shall we join the natives?

545
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:37,269
- Why not? They seem friendly enough.
- Don't you believe it?

546
00:45:37,398 --> 00:45:41,353
There'll be human sacrifices. White-collar
workers tossed into computers...

547
00:45:41,475 --> 00:45:43,624
..and punched full of little square holes.

548
00:45:43,754 --> 00:45:45,869
- How many drinks did you have?
- Three!

549
00:45:45,994 --> 00:45:49,063
- I thought so.
- Wait. I hear the sound of running water.

550
00:45:49,191 --> 00:45:51,659
- I'll be right back!
- I'll be right here.

551
00:45:53,069 --> 00:45:54,658
(Slurring) Hi!

552
00:45:54,788 --> 00:45:57,300
How's the branch manager
from Kansas City?

553
00:45:57,427 --> 00:45:59,064
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm Miss Olsen.

554
00:45:59,186 --> 00:46:01,062
Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.

555
00:46:01,185 --> 00:46:03,458
So you don't have to
play innocent with me.

556
00:46:03,584 --> 00:46:07,460
He used to tell his wife
I was the branch manager from Seattle...

557
00:46:07,582 --> 00:46:11,652
..four years ago when we were having
a little ring-a-ding-ding.

558
00:46:12,578 --> 00:46:16,533
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Before me it was Miss Rossi in Auditing.

559
00:46:16,655 --> 00:46:19,215
And after me it was
Miss Koch in Disability.

560
00:46:19,334 --> 00:46:21,608
And right before you was a Miss, um...

561
00:46:21,733 --> 00:46:24,006
Oh, what's her name? On the 25th floor.

562
00:46:24,131 --> 00:46:27,564
- Would you excuse me?
- What for? You haven't done anything.

563
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:30,758
It's him. Oh, what a salesman!

564
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:33,601
Always the last booth
in the Chinese restaurant...

565
00:46:33,726 --> 00:46:36,683
..and the same pitch
about divorcing his wife.

566
00:46:38,723 --> 00:46:42,998
Then, in the end, you wind up
with egg foo yung on your face.

567
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,074
Miss Kubelik!

568
00:46:47,077 --> 00:46:48,795
Well, thank you, Miss Olsen.

569
00:46:48,918 --> 00:46:52,873
Always happy to do a little something
for our girls in uniform.

570
00:46:54,035 --> 00:46:56,102
Are you all right? What's the matter?

571
00:46:56,233 --> 00:46:58,700
Nothing. There are just
too many people here.

572
00:46:58,832 --> 00:47:02,617
Why don't we step into my office? There's
something I want your opinion about.

573
00:47:02,749 --> 00:47:07,342
I have my own office now. I'm the second
youngest executive in this company.

574
00:47:07,466 --> 00:47:11,013
The only one younger is a grandson
of the chairman of the board.

575
00:47:12,223 --> 00:47:14,177
(Whistles) Do you mind?

576
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:21,574
Miss Kubelik, I would like
your honest opinion.

577
00:47:21,698 --> 00:47:24,847
I've had this under my desk
for a week. It cost me $15.

578
00:47:24,977 --> 00:47:28,124
I haven't been able
to get up enough nerve to wear it.

579
00:47:33,572 --> 00:47:38,324
It's what they call the Junior Executive
model. What do you think?

580
00:47:41,607 --> 00:47:44,437
I guess I made a boo-boo, huh?

581
00:47:44,564 --> 00:47:46,714
- I like it.
- Really?

582
00:47:46,845 --> 00:47:49,640
You wouldn't be ashamed to be seen
with somebody in this hat?

583
00:47:49,762 --> 00:47:53,594
- Of course not.
- Maybe if I wore it a little to one side.

584
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,358
- Is that better?
- Much better.

585
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,070
Since you wouldn't be
ashamed to be seen with me,...

586
00:47:59,197 --> 00:48:02,186
..how about goin' out tonight -
you, me and the bowler?

587
00:48:02,316 --> 00:48:05,032
We'll stroll down 5th Avenue,
sort of break it in.

588
00:48:05,153 --> 00:48:08,826
- This is a bad day for me.
- I understand. Christmas and family.

589
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:11,258
I'd better get back to my elevator
or I'll be fired.

590
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:15,064
Don't worry about that. I've got
quite a bit of influence with Personnel.

591
00:48:15,188 --> 00:48:17,143
You know Mr. Sheldrake?

592
00:48:18,585 --> 00:48:20,859
- Why?
- He and I are like that.

593
00:48:20,984 --> 00:48:23,543
Sent me a Christmas card. See?

594
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:31,658
Makes a cute picture.

595
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:35,170
I could talk to Mr. Sheldrake.
Get you a promotion.

596
00:48:35,296 --> 00:48:40,764
- Would you like to be an elevator starter?
- Too many girls have seniority over me.

597
00:48:41,172 --> 00:48:44,128
No problem. Why don't we
discuss it over the holidays?

598
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:48,481
I could call you, pick you up, have
a big unveiling. Am I wearing this right?

599
00:48:48,609 --> 00:48:50,677
I think so. Here.

600
00:48:50,808 --> 00:48:53,719
It's not tilted too much?
This is a conservative firm.

601
00:48:53,846 --> 00:48:56,801
I don't want people
to think I'm an entertainer.

602
00:49:01,082 --> 00:49:03,037
What's the matter?

603
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:08,067
- The mirror. It's broken.
- Yes, I know.

604
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:12,027
I like it that way.
Makes me look the way I feel.

605
00:49:12,156 --> 00:49:13,747
(Phone rings)

606
00:49:16,152 --> 00:49:18,107
Your phone.

607
00:49:23,548 --> 00:49:25,503
Yes?

608
00:49:26,068 --> 00:49:27,818
Uh, just a minute.

609
00:49:27,947 --> 00:49:32,299
- If you don't mind, this is sort of personal.
- Have a nice Christmas.

610
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,733
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

611
00:49:41,777 --> 00:49:46,894
No, I didn't forget. The tree is up and the
Tom and Jerry mix is in the refrigerator.

612
00:49:47,014 --> 00:49:48,970
Yes, sir. Same to you.

613
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:58,524
(Cheering)

614
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,506
Hey! Where are you goin', Buddy-boy?

615
00:50:17,637 --> 00:50:19,787
The party's just starting.

616
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:23,190
Listen, kid. Gimme a break.
How about tomorrow afternoon?

617
00:50:23,316 --> 00:50:28,590
I can't take her to that drive-in again.
The car has no heater. Four o'clock. OK?

618
00:50:40,585 --> 00:50:42,538
(Slow band music)

619
00:51:05,347 --> 00:51:10,702
Hey, Charlie! Gimme a shot of bourbon,
and step on it! My sleigh is double-parked!

620
00:52:02,075 --> 00:52:04,030
(Music ends)

621
00:52:15,227 --> 00:52:18,297
You buy me a drink,
I'll buy you some music.

622
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,380
Rum Collins.

623
00:52:27,784 --> 00:52:29,056
Uh...

624
00:52:29,183 --> 00:52:32,651
Rum Collins and...
another one of these little mothers.

625
00:52:36,099 --> 00:52:38,658
("O Come, All Ye Faithful")

626
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,875
You like Castro?

627
00:52:46,999 --> 00:52:49,718
I mean, how do you feel about Castro?

628
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:53,509
- What is Castro?
- You know. That big shot down in Cuba.

629
00:52:53,635 --> 00:52:55,705
- With the crazy beard.
- What about him?

630
00:52:55,836 --> 00:52:58,984
Cos as far as I'm concerned,
he's a no-good fink.

631
00:52:59,112 --> 00:53:02,341
Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter.
Never even answered me.

632
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,424
That so?

633
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:07,223
All I wanted him to do was
let Mickey out for Christmas.

634
00:53:07,347 --> 00:53:09,303
- Who's Mickey?
- My husband.

635
00:53:09,428 --> 00:53:11,893
He's in Havana, in jail.

636
00:53:12,024 --> 00:53:15,413
- Mixed up in that revolution?
- Mickey would do nothin' like that.

637
00:53:15,543 --> 00:53:19,170
He's a jockey.
They caught him dopin' a horse.

638
00:53:19,302 --> 00:53:21,451
Well, you can't win 'em all.

639
00:53:26,417 --> 00:53:29,930
'Twas the night before Christmas,
and all through the house

640
00:53:30,055 --> 00:53:32,011
Not a creature was stirrin'...

641
00:53:32,774 --> 00:53:35,729
Nothin'. No action.

642
00:53:36,252 --> 00:53:38,080
Dullsville.

643
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:40,245
- You married?
- No.

644
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:42,324
- Family?
- No.

645
00:53:43,128 --> 00:53:47,482
A night like this, it sort of spooks you
to walk into an empty apartment.

646
00:53:49,004 --> 00:53:52,960
I said I had no family. I didn't say
I had an empty apartment.

647
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,518
(Fran crying)

648
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,993
Come on, Fran. Don't be that way.

649
00:54:00,678 --> 00:54:03,555
Are you just gonna
sit there and keep bawling?

650
00:54:03,677 --> 00:54:06,825
You won't talk to me?
You won't tell me what's wrong?

651
00:54:08,512 --> 00:54:13,378
I know you think I'm stalling you but...
when you've been married for 12 years,...

652
00:54:13,509 --> 00:54:17,899
..you just don't sit down to breakfast and
say "Pass the sugar. I want a divorce."

653
00:54:18,029 --> 00:54:20,494
It's not that easy.

654
00:54:21,706 --> 00:54:26,333
Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids
are off school, my in-laws are visiting.

655
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:28,418
I can't bring it up now.

656
00:54:28,543 --> 00:54:30,020
(Fran sobs)

657
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:35,006
This isn't like you, Fran. You were always
such a good sport. Such fun to be with.

658
00:54:37,257 --> 00:54:41,451
That's me. The happy idiot.
A million laughs.

659
00:54:42,374 --> 00:54:46,445
Well, that's a little more like it.
At least you're speaking to me.

660
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:50,679
A funny thing happened to me
at the office party today.

661
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:53,164
I ran into your secretary, Miss Olsen.

662
00:54:54,128 --> 00:54:56,081
You know. Ring-a-ding-ding?

663
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,876
And I laughed so much, I like to died.

664
00:55:00,003 --> 00:55:04,439
Is that what's been bothering you, Fran?
Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.

665
00:55:04,561 --> 00:55:07,517
Well, I never was very good at history.

666
00:55:08,199 --> 00:55:12,269
Let me see. There was Miss Olsen,
and then there was Miss Rossi.

667
00:55:12,398 --> 00:55:15,386
No, she came before.
Miss Koch came after Miss Olsen.

668
00:55:15,516 --> 00:55:17,823
- Now, Fran...
- And just think.

669
00:55:17,954 --> 00:55:21,661
Right now some lucky girl in the building
is gonna come after me.

670
00:55:21,792 --> 00:55:24,429
OK. OK, Fran. I guess I deserved that.

671
00:55:24,549 --> 00:55:28,506
But ask yourself: why does a man
run around with a lot of girls?

672
00:55:28,628 --> 00:55:32,254
Because he's unhappy at home.
Because he's lonely. That's why.

673
00:55:32,386 --> 00:55:35,501
But that was before you, Fran.
I've stopped running.

674
00:55:36,982 --> 00:55:40,938
How could I be so stupid?
You'd think I would've learned by now.

675
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:45,415
When you're in love with a married man,
you shouldn't wear mascara.

676
00:55:46,136 --> 00:55:49,127
It's Christmas Eve, Fran.
Let's not fight, huh?

677
00:55:51,335 --> 00:55:53,689
- Merry Christmas.
- What is it?

678
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:01,526
Oh. Our friend at the Chinese restaurant.

679
00:56:02,728 --> 00:56:07,797
- Thanks, Fran. We'd better keep it here.
- Yeah, we'd better.

680
00:56:08,524 --> 00:56:10,559
Oh, I have a present for you.

681
00:56:10,683 --> 00:56:14,877
I didn't know what to get you. Besides,
it's kind of awkward for me shopping, so...

682
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,356
Here's $100. You go
and buy yourself something.

683
00:56:23,115 --> 00:56:26,187
They have some nice
alligator bags at Bergdorf's.

684
00:56:37,467 --> 00:56:41,424
I didn't realize it was so late. Its quarter
to seven. I mustn't miss my train.

685
00:56:41,546 --> 00:56:45,900
If we hadn't wasted all this time...
I have to get home and trim the tree.

686
00:56:46,463 --> 00:56:50,169
OK. I just thought,
as long as it was paid for...

687
00:56:50,301 --> 00:56:52,336
Don't ever talk like that, Fran.

688
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:56,416
- Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
- $100? I don't call that cheap.

689
00:56:56,538 --> 00:57:00,494
And you must be paying somebody
something for the use of the apartment.

690
00:57:00,616 --> 00:57:02,571
Stop it, Fran.

691
00:57:03,613 --> 00:57:05,568
You'll miss your train, Jeff.

692
00:57:13,848 --> 00:57:15,404
Are you coming?

693
00:57:15,526 --> 00:57:18,085
No, you run along. I'm gonna fix my face.

694
00:57:18,205 --> 00:57:20,636
Don't forget to kill the lights.
See you Monday.

695
00:57:20,763 --> 00:57:24,198
Sure. Monday... and Thursday...

696
00:57:24,322 --> 00:57:27,437
..and Monday again, and Thursday again.

697
00:57:29,319 --> 00:57:32,116
It won't always be like this, Fran.

698
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:34,306
I love you.

699
00:57:34,437 --> 00:57:36,585
Careful. Lipstick.

700
00:57:37,874 --> 00:57:39,827
Merry Christmas.

701
00:57:54,623 --> 00:57:56,578
(Sighs)

702
00:58:05,738 --> 00:58:07,693
("Jealous Lover")

703
00:58:11,734 --> 00:58:13,689
(Sniffs)

704
00:58:24,847 --> 00:58:26,802
(Sobs)

705
00:59:46,161 --> 00:59:48,115
(Big band blues)

706
01:00:01,646 --> 01:00:05,112
- Drink up, pop. It's closing time.
- But it's early, Charlie.

707
01:00:05,242 --> 01:00:08,677
- Don't you know what night this is?
- I know, Charlie. I know.

708
01:00:08,803 --> 01:00:10,756
I work for the outfit.

709
01:00:16,118 --> 01:00:18,754
Hey, knock it off, will ya? Go home.

710
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:28,746
O-U-T. Out!

711
01:00:33,468 --> 01:00:36,024
Where'll we go? My place or yours?

712
01:00:38,546 --> 01:00:41,739
Might as well go to mine.
Everybody else does.

713
01:00:52,977 --> 01:00:58,127
Poor Mickey. When I think of him
all by himself in that jail in Havana...

714
01:00:58,253 --> 01:01:00,403
Would you like to see his picture?

715
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:02,485
Not particularly.

716
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:08,438
He's so cute. He's 5 foot 2, 99 pounds.

717
01:01:08,568 --> 01:01:10,522
Like a little Chihuahua.

718
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,870
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- No.

719
01:01:25,998 --> 01:01:27,873
You got a girlfriend?

720
01:01:27,997 --> 01:01:30,748
She may be a girl
but she is no friend of mine.

721
01:01:30,876 --> 01:01:34,865
- Still stuck on her, huh?
- Obviously you don't know me very well.

722
01:01:35,032 --> 01:01:37,623
- I don't know you at all.
- Permit me.

723
01:01:38,071 --> 01:01:44,256
CC Baxter. Junior executive,
Arthur Murray graduate... lover.

724
01:01:44,388 --> 01:01:47,616
I'm Mrs. MacDougall. Margie to you.

725
01:01:48,944 --> 01:01:50,899
This way, Mrs. MacDougall.

726
01:02:00,937 --> 01:02:03,654
Say! This is snugsville!

727
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:06,288
Mrs. MacDougall,
it's only fair to warn you...

728
01:02:06,414 --> 01:02:09,642
..you are now alone
with a notorious sexpot.

729
01:02:09,772 --> 01:02:12,332
- No kiddin'!
- Ask anybody around here.

730
01:02:12,451 --> 01:02:16,361
As a matter of fact, when it's time for me
to go - and I may go just like that -

731
01:02:16,489 --> 01:02:19,286
I have promised my body
to the Columbia Medical Center.

732
01:02:19,408 --> 01:02:22,282
Gee! Sort of gives you goose bumps
just to think about it.

733
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:25,554
They haven't got me yet, baby.
Dig up some ice from the kitchen.

734
01:02:25,684 --> 01:02:28,479
Let's not waste any more time
preliminary-wise.

735
01:02:28,601 --> 01:02:30,556
I'm with you, lover.

736
01:02:52,428 --> 01:02:54,417
(Latin-beat dance music)

737
01:02:54,547 --> 01:02:56,502
(Hums along)

738
01:03:43,999 --> 01:03:46,353
All right, Miss Kubelik. Get up.

739
01:03:47,116 --> 01:03:49,231
Come on. It's past checking-out time.

740
01:03:49,355 --> 01:03:53,551
The management would appreciate it
if you'd get the hell outta here.

741
01:03:56,230 --> 01:04:01,348
I used to like you. I used to like you a lot.
Well, it's all over between us, so beat it.

742
01:04:01,988 --> 01:04:03,943
O-U-T, out!

743
01:04:05,066 --> 01:04:07,021
Come on, wake up.

744
01:04:13,302 --> 01:04:15,257
Oh my God.

745
01:04:15,381 --> 01:04:17,334
Miss Kubelik?

746
01:04:18,019 --> 01:04:19,973
Miss Kubelik?

747
01:04:29,373 --> 01:04:32,168
I broke a nail tryin' to get the tray out.

748
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:35,248
You oughta buy yourself
a new refrigerator.

749
01:04:37,567 --> 01:04:39,319
I didn't mean right now!

750
01:04:42,206 --> 01:04:44,160
Dr. Dreyfuss.

751
01:04:44,725 --> 01:04:46,678
Doc!

752
01:04:47,642 --> 01:04:51,520
There's a girl in my place, took
some sleeping pills. I can't wake her up.

753
01:04:51,641 --> 01:04:53,595
- Let me get my bag.
- Hurry up!

754
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:58,905
Hey, over here, lover.
What's all the running around about?

755
01:04:59,035 --> 01:05:01,594
You're gonna wear yourself out.

756
01:05:02,394 --> 01:05:04,861
- Not so rough, honey!
- Good night.

757
01:05:04,993 --> 01:05:06,948
- Good night?!
- The party's over.

758
01:05:07,072 --> 01:05:09,185
What? Did I do somethin' wrong?

759
01:05:09,309 --> 01:05:12,504
It's an emergency.
I'll see you some other time.

760
01:05:12,629 --> 01:05:14,582
Not this one. In there, Doc.

761
01:05:15,547 --> 01:05:19,139
- What's goin' on here, anyway?
- Will you please just get out?!

762
01:05:19,265 --> 01:05:20,742
My shoes!

763
01:05:20,864 --> 01:05:23,739
Some lover you are! Some sexpot!

764
01:05:23,861 --> 01:05:26,499
Here. Find a phone.
Call your husband in Havana.

765
01:05:26,621 --> 01:05:31,849
You bet I will! And when I tell him how
you treated me, he'll push your face in!

766
01:05:31,977 --> 01:05:33,931
You fink!

767
01:05:48,847 --> 01:05:50,802
Is she gonna be all right, Doc?

768
01:05:50,926 --> 01:05:54,803
- How many pills were in that bottle?
- It was half-full. About a dozen.

769
01:05:54,924 --> 01:05:57,799
- Do you have to take her to the hospital?
- Help me, will you?

770
01:05:57,922 --> 01:06:00,481
- Into the bathroom.
- What are you gonna do?

771
01:06:00,601 --> 01:06:03,272
Get that stuff out of her stomach
if it isn't too late.

772
01:06:03,399 --> 01:06:05,956
You'd better put some coffee on,
and pray.

773
01:06:34,542 --> 01:06:36,496
(Fran vomits and coughs)

774
01:06:58,608 --> 01:07:00,562
Bring my bag.

775
01:07:10,001 --> 01:07:11,956
Roll up her right sleeve.

776
01:07:21,354 --> 01:07:23,309
Hold that.

777
01:07:30,031 --> 01:07:31,983
Nice veins.

778
01:07:43,263 --> 01:07:45,979
Wanna tell me what happened?

779
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:48,657
I don't know. I mean, I wasn't even here.

780
01:07:51,578 --> 01:07:55,203
You see, we had... some words earlier.

781
01:07:55,335 --> 01:07:59,291
It was nothin' serious.
You might call it a lovers' quarrel.

782
01:08:00,253 --> 01:08:03,048
So you went right out
and picked yourself up another dame.

783
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:07,762
- Something like that.
- You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie pie.

784
01:08:07,887 --> 01:08:09,366
Yes, you are.

785
01:08:17,203 --> 01:08:22,114
If you'd come home half an hour later,
you'd have had quite a Christmas present.

786
01:08:37,631 --> 01:08:39,585
(Kettle whistles)

787
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:42,104
Get the coffee.

788
01:08:43,746 --> 01:08:45,701
(Fran moans)

789
01:09:04,734 --> 01:09:07,453
Let's get some air in here.
Open the windows.

790
01:09:10,452 --> 01:09:12,407
(Fran coughs)

791
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:24,080
What's her name?

792
01:09:24,204 --> 01:09:26,794
Miss Kubelik. Fran.

793
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:35,065
Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because
you took too many sleeping pills.

794
01:09:35,197 --> 01:09:37,312
Do you understand what I'm saying?

795
01:09:37,437 --> 01:09:38,870
(Fran moans)

796
01:09:38,997 --> 01:09:42,303
Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss.
I'm here to help you.

797
01:09:42,434 --> 01:09:45,229
You took all those sleeping pills.
Remember?

798
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:49,859
- Sleeping pills.
- That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.

799
01:09:50,669 --> 01:09:53,386
- Doctor?
- Dr. Dreyfuss.

800
01:09:55,786 --> 01:09:57,298
Dreyfuss.

801
01:09:57,425 --> 01:09:59,380
Get more coffee.

802
01:10:00,266 --> 01:10:02,617
Now tell me again. What's my name?

803
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:07,974
Dr.... Dreyfuss.

804
01:10:08,099 --> 01:10:10,054
And what happened to you?

805
01:10:10,619 --> 01:10:12,254
I...

806
01:10:12,376 --> 01:10:14,332
I took sleeping pills.

807
01:10:14,896 --> 01:10:17,248
Do you know where you are?

808
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:22,321
- No.
- Yes, you do, Fran. Now concentrate!

809
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:26,125
I don't know.

810
01:10:27,009 --> 01:10:28,964
Do you know who that is?

811
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:37,399
Look at him.

812
01:10:38,441 --> 01:10:41,193
Mr. Baxter. 19th floor.

813
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,835
Hello, Miss Kubelik.

814
01:10:44,279 --> 01:10:46,711
Mr.? Miss? Such politeness!

815
01:10:47,956 --> 01:10:51,789
We work in the same building.
We try to keep it quiet.

816
01:10:53,393 --> 01:10:55,952
What are you doing here?

817
01:10:57,471 --> 01:11:01,064
Don't you remember
we were together at the office party?

818
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:03,496
Oh, yes. The office party.

819
01:11:03,628 --> 01:11:06,095
- Miss Olsen.
- That's right.

820
01:11:06,227 --> 01:11:09,058
I told you we had a fight.
That was what it was about.

821
01:11:09,185 --> 01:11:12,380
Miss Olsen. That girl
that was here earlier.

822
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:16,493
I don't understand.

823
01:11:16,621 --> 01:11:21,771
The main thing is I got here in time and
you're gonna be all right. Isn't she, Doc?

824
01:11:22,658 --> 01:11:24,850
I'm so tired.

825
01:11:24,975 --> 01:11:26,931
Come on. Drink this.

826
01:11:27,294 --> 01:11:29,885
Please... just let me sleep.

827
01:11:30,012 --> 01:11:33,639
No, you can't sleep! Fran, open your eyes!

828
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:36,244
Let's get her walking.

829
01:11:38,807 --> 01:11:43,242
We've got to keep her awake for the next
few hours. Now come on, Fran, walk!

830
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:45,831
One, two, three, four!

831
01:11:45,963 --> 01:11:48,158
One, two, three, four!

832
01:11:48,283 --> 01:11:50,396
Left, right, left, right,...

833
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,669
..left, right and return!

834
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,869
And... one, two, three, four!

835
01:11:55,998 --> 01:11:59,271
Now you've got it! One, two, three, four!

836
01:11:59,396 --> 01:12:02,513
Walk, Fran! One, two, three, four!

837
01:12:02,636 --> 01:12:05,191
One, two... And return again.

838
01:12:05,312 --> 01:12:08,302
And... left, right, left, right.

839
01:12:15,226 --> 01:12:18,420
She'll sleep on and off
for the next 24 hours.

840
01:12:18,544 --> 01:12:22,092
Of course, she'll have
a dandy hangover when she wakes up.

841
01:12:22,223 --> 01:12:24,179
Just as long as she's OK.

842
01:12:24,303 --> 01:12:29,578
These cases are harder on the doctor than
the patient. I oughta charge by the mile.

843
01:12:29,699 --> 01:12:32,656
- Any of that coffee left?
- Yeah, sure.

844
01:12:33,616 --> 01:12:35,968
How do you spell her last name?

845
01:12:36,093 --> 01:12:38,483
Kubelik. Two k's.

846
01:12:38,614 --> 01:12:40,567
What's her address?

847
01:12:41,292 --> 01:12:43,246
Where does she live?

848
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:46,565
Why do you wanna know, Doc?

849
01:12:47,609 --> 01:12:50,643
- You don't have to report this, do you?
- It's regulations.

850
01:12:50,767 --> 01:12:55,553
But it was an accident. She had too much
to drink, didn't know what she was doing.

851
01:12:55,684 --> 01:12:57,752
There was no suicide note or anything.

852
01:12:57,882 --> 01:13:00,872
- I'm not thinkin' about myself.
- Aren't you?

853
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:04,355
She's got a family,
and there's the people at the office.

854
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:08,231
Can't you forget you're a doctor,
just say you're here as a neighbour?

855
01:13:08,358 --> 01:13:11,107
Well, as a doctor, I can't prove
it wasn't an accident.

856
01:13:11,234 --> 01:13:14,305
But as your neighbour,
I'd like to kick you around the block.

857
01:13:14,434 --> 01:13:16,864
- Mind if I cool this off?
- Help yourself.

858
01:13:16,990 --> 01:13:19,297
I don't know what you did to that girl,...

859
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:21,862
..but it was bound to happen,
the way you carry on.

860
01:13:21,988 --> 01:13:24,341
Live now, pay later. Diners Club!

861
01:13:26,225 --> 01:13:29,057
Why don't you grow up, Baxter?
Be a mensch.

862
01:13:29,184 --> 01:13:31,491
- You know what that means?
- I'm not sure.

863
01:13:31,622 --> 01:13:33,577
A mensch/ A human being!

864
01:13:34,542 --> 01:13:37,451
So you got off easy this time.
So you were lucky.

865
01:13:37,578 --> 01:13:42,046
But you're not out of the woods yet,
because most of 'em try it again.

866
01:13:43,057 --> 01:13:45,524
Well, you know where I am
if you need me.

867
01:14:54,536 --> 01:14:57,208
Mr. Baxter! Open up already.

868
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:02,243
Oh.

869
01:15:02,372 --> 01:15:05,645
- Mrs. Lieberman.
- Who did you think it was? Kriss Kringle?

870
01:15:05,769 --> 01:15:07,804
What was going on here last night?

871
01:15:07,928 --> 01:15:11,156
- Last night?
- All that marching! Tramp, tramp, tramp!

872
01:15:11,285 --> 01:15:14,561
- Army manoeuvres maybe?
- I'll never invite those people again.

873
01:15:14,685 --> 01:15:18,722
What you get from renting to bachelors.
All night I didn't sleep ten minutes.

874
01:15:18,843 --> 01:15:24,118
- And I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
- Don't worry. He was out on a case.

875
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:29,151
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter. This is
a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.

876
01:15:29,276 --> 01:15:31,231
Come on, Oscar.

877
01:15:57,988 --> 01:16:02,454
Operator, I want White Plains,
New York. Mr. JD Sheldrake.

878
01:16:02,583 --> 01:16:04,539
Make that person-to-person.

879
01:16:09,143 --> 01:16:12,052
Five, four, three, two, one...

880
01:16:12,179 --> 01:16:14,645
- Let her rip!
- (Phone rings)

881
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:16,336
I'll get the phone.

882
01:16:16,458 --> 01:16:19,288
Hey, Dad, why don't we
put a fly in the nose cone?

883
01:16:19,416 --> 01:16:22,212
- See if we can bring it back alive.
- That's a thought.

884
01:16:22,334 --> 01:16:26,243
Maybe we should put in two flies
and see if they'll propagate in orbit.

885
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:30,362
- See if they'll what?
- Propagate. You know. Multiply.

886
01:16:30,491 --> 01:16:34,035
- Baby flies?
- Oh. Oh!

887
01:16:34,847 --> 01:16:37,313
- It's for you, Dad.
- Thanks, Jeff.

888
01:16:37,444 --> 01:16:40,515
A Mr. Baxter. Person-to-person.

889
01:16:40,643 --> 01:16:43,156
Come on. Help me round up some flies.

890
01:16:43,282 --> 01:16:47,829
- Hello? What's on your mind, Baxter?
- Something came up that's important.

891
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:51,394
I think you should see me
at the apartment as soon as possible.

892
01:16:51,518 --> 01:16:55,110
- What's this all about?
- I didn't wanna tell you over the phone.

893
01:16:55,235 --> 01:17:00,145
But that certain party... You know
who I mean. I found her here last night.

894
01:17:00,272 --> 01:17:03,261
- She took an overdose of sleeping pills.
- What?!

895
01:17:05,577 --> 01:17:09,406
- What is it, Jeff? Who's on the phone?
- One of our employees had an accident.

896
01:17:09,535 --> 01:17:12,810
I don't know why they bother me
with these things on Christmas Day.

897
01:17:12,934 --> 01:17:14,684
Yes, Baxter.

898
01:17:14,812 --> 01:17:16,767
Just how serious is it?

899
01:17:16,891 --> 01:17:20,403
It was touch and go there for a while,
but she's sleeping it off now.

900
01:17:20,528 --> 01:17:23,404
I thought maybe you'd like to
be here when she wakes up.

901
01:17:24,446 --> 01:17:28,721
That's impossible. You'll have to
handle the situation yourself, Baxter.

902
01:17:28,843 --> 01:17:33,073
- As a matter of fact, I'm counting on you.
- Yes, sir. I understand.

903
01:17:33,202 --> 01:17:37,396
She left a letter. Would you like me
to open it and read it to you?

904
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:40,154
Well, it was just a suggestion.

905
01:17:40,276 --> 01:17:44,028
No, don't worry. I kept your name
out of it, so there'll be no trouble,...

906
01:17:44,154 --> 01:17:46,509
..police-wise or newspaper-wise.

907
01:17:47,714 --> 01:17:51,908
You see, the doctor is a friend of mine,
so we were very lucky in that respect.

908
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:54,384
Actually, he thinks she's my girl.

909
01:17:55,229 --> 01:17:57,378
No, he just jumped to the conclusion.

910
01:17:57,507 --> 01:18:00,225
Around here I'm known as
quite a ladies' man.

911
01:18:00,346 --> 01:18:04,417
Of course, we're not out of the woods yet.
Sometimes they try it again.

912
01:18:04,544 --> 01:18:08,295
Yes, sir. I'll do my best. It'll take her
a couple of days to fully recover...

913
01:18:08,421 --> 01:18:11,569
..and I may have a little problem
with the landlady.

914
01:18:12,259 --> 01:18:15,567
OK, Mr. Sheldrake. I'll keep her
in the apartment as long as I can.

915
01:18:15,698 --> 01:18:19,085
Isn't there some sort of message
you want me to give her?

916
01:18:19,536 --> 01:18:21,649
Well, I'll... think of something.

917
01:18:22,212 --> 01:18:24,247
Yes, sir. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

918
01:18:27,011 --> 01:18:28,966
I'm sorry.

919
01:18:29,690 --> 01:18:33,158
- I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
- What are you doing out of bed?

920
01:18:33,287 --> 01:18:36,357
I didn't know. I had no idea
this was your apartment.

921
01:18:36,485 --> 01:18:39,077
Here. Let me help you.

922
01:18:39,563 --> 01:18:41,518
Oh, I'm so ashamed.

923
01:18:41,642 --> 01:18:43,595
Why didn't you just let me die?

924
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:49,074
What kind of talk is that? You got
a little overemotional, but you're fine now.

925
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:50,596
Oh!

926
01:18:50,717 --> 01:18:54,867
Oh, my head! It feels just like
a big wad of chewing gum.

927
01:18:54,995 --> 01:18:57,632
- What time is it?
- Two o'clock.

928
01:18:57,753 --> 01:18:59,902
Oh, my dress. I have to go home.

929
01:19:00,032 --> 01:19:02,384
You're in no shape
to go anywhere but back to bed.

930
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:04,898
- You don't want me here.
- Sure I do. I...

931
01:19:05,028 --> 01:19:08,018
It's always nice
to have company for Christmas.

932
01:19:08,148 --> 01:19:11,534
- I'm stronger than you are.
- I just wanna brush my teeth.

933
01:19:11,665 --> 01:19:15,054
Oh. Of course. I think I can find
a new toothbrush somewhere.

934
01:19:15,183 --> 01:19:17,740
Here. Put that on.

935
01:19:45,246 --> 01:19:48,839
- How about some breakfast?
- No. I don't want anything.

936
01:19:48,964 --> 01:19:50,919
I'll fix you some coffee.

937
01:19:51,043 --> 01:19:55,191
Oh! We're all out of coffee.
You had quite a lot last night.

938
01:19:55,319 --> 01:19:57,275
Back in a minute.

939
01:20:06,315 --> 01:20:08,542
Mrs. Dreyfuss,
could I borrow some coffee?

940
01:20:08,672 --> 01:20:12,299
- And an orange and a couple of eggs?
- Eggs, he asks me for! Oranges!

941
01:20:12,431 --> 01:20:16,739
What you need is a good horsewhipping!
From me the doctor has no secrets.

942
01:20:16,868 --> 01:20:19,017
Poor girl. How could you do such a thing?

943
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:21,978
I didn't do anything. Honest. It's just...

944
01:20:22,824 --> 01:20:28,100
You take a girl out just for laughs and
she thinks you're serious marriage-wise.

945
01:20:28,222 --> 01:20:31,575
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger!

946
01:20:31,699 --> 01:20:34,656
But for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.

947
01:20:42,854 --> 01:20:44,524
Who are you calling?

948
01:20:44,652 --> 01:20:46,687
My sister, to tell her
what happened to me.

949
01:20:46,811 --> 01:20:51,563
Wait a minute! Let's talk it over first.
Just what are you gonna tell her?

950
01:20:52,326 --> 01:20:56,113
- I haven't figured it out exactly.
- Well, you'd better figure it out exactly.

951
01:20:56,246 --> 01:20:59,202
Suppose she asks you why
you didn't come home last night.

952
01:20:59,324 --> 01:21:01,198
I'll say I spent the night with a friend.

953
01:21:01,321 --> 01:21:03,277
- Who?
- Someone from the office.

954
01:21:03,401 --> 01:21:05,153
- Where are you now?
- In his apartment.

955
01:21:05,281 --> 01:21:07,552
- In his apartment?
- In her apartment.

956
01:21:07,678 --> 01:21:09,793
- What's your friend's name?
- Baxter.

957
01:21:09,919 --> 01:21:12,873
- What's her first name?
- Miss.

958
01:21:12,996 --> 01:21:15,713
- When are you comin' home?
- As soon as I can walk.

959
01:21:15,834 --> 01:21:17,789
- Your legs hurt?
- No, my stomach.

960
01:21:17,913 --> 01:21:20,584
- Your stomach?
- They had to pump it out!

961
01:21:20,711 --> 01:21:25,419
You shouldn't call anybody. Not till you
get the chewing gum out of your head.

962
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:28,583
They'll be worried about me.
They might call the police.

963
01:21:28,706 --> 01:21:31,777
We have to be careful.
We don't wanna involve anybody.

964
01:21:31,905 --> 01:21:34,861
After all, Mr. Sheldrake's a married man.

965
01:21:35,663 --> 01:21:37,617
Thanks for reminding me!

966
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:43,214
I didn't mean it that way.

967
01:21:43,338 --> 01:21:47,294
I was just talking to him on the phone.
He's very concerned about you.

968
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:50,053
He doesn't give a damn about me.

969
01:21:50,175 --> 01:21:53,767
- You're wrong. He told me...
- He's a liar.

970
01:21:53,893 --> 01:21:56,040
But that's not the worst part.

971
01:21:56,171 --> 01:21:58,445
The worst part is I still love him.

972
01:21:59,329 --> 01:22:01,285
(Doorbell)

973
01:22:02,328 --> 01:22:04,441
Oh. That must be Mrs. Dreyfuss.

974
01:22:04,566 --> 01:22:07,874
Remember the doctor from last night?
That's his wife.

975
01:22:09,524 --> 01:22:11,478
So where's the victim?

976
01:22:12,481 --> 01:22:14,436
Max the Knife!

977
01:22:16,961 --> 01:22:21,031
- Nu, little lady, how are we feeling today?
- I don't know. Kind of dizzy.

978
01:22:21,158 --> 01:22:26,307
The best thing for dizzy is noodle soup
with chicken white meat and a glass tea.

979
01:22:26,434 --> 01:22:30,709
- No, thank you. I'm really not hungry.
- Go ahead, eat. Enjoy.

980
01:22:30,831 --> 01:22:33,628
You wouldn't have such a thing
as a napkin, would you?

981
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:36,820
- I have some paper towels.
- Beatnik.

982
01:22:36,948 --> 01:22:40,301
In my kitchen, third drawer,
under the good silver, are napkins.

983
01:22:40,425 --> 01:22:41,743
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

984
01:22:41,865 --> 01:22:44,377
So, what are you waiting for?
A singing commercial?

985
01:22:44,503 --> 01:22:46,458
- I can't eat.
- You must eat.

986
01:22:46,582 --> 01:22:49,616
And you must get healthy
and you must forget him.

987
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:52,890
Such a fine boy he seemed
when he first moved in here.

988
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:55,894
Clean and cut, a regular lvy Leaguer.

989
01:22:56,018 --> 01:23:00,293
Turns out he's King Farouk,
with the drinking, with the cha-cha.

990
01:23:00,414 --> 01:23:02,369
With the no napkins.

991
01:23:02,493 --> 01:23:06,370
A girl like you, for the rest of your life
you wanna cry in your noodle soup?

992
01:23:06,491 --> 01:23:08,957
Who needs it? Now you listen to me.

993
01:23:09,089 --> 01:23:13,080
You'll find yourself a nice,
substantial man - a widower, maybe -

994
01:23:13,208 --> 01:23:16,720
and settle down, instead of
noshing all those sleeping pills.

995
01:23:16,845 --> 01:23:19,879
For what? For whom?
For some good-time Charlie?

996
01:23:20,002 --> 01:23:21,833
- (Door opens)
- Shh.

997
01:23:21,962 --> 01:23:25,839
One napkin comin' up. Wish we had
some champagne to wrap it around.

998
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:28,995
- What did I tell you?
- Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait.

999
01:23:29,118 --> 01:23:32,904
- I'll wash the dishes.
- You'd break 'em. I'll come back for them.

1000
01:23:33,037 --> 01:23:35,423
If he makes trouble, give me a yell.

1001
01:23:36,713 --> 01:23:40,387
- She doesn't seem to like you very much.
- Oh, I don't mind.

1002
01:23:40,512 --> 01:23:42,979
As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered.

1003
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:48,056
That anybody'd think a girl like you would
do a thing like this over a guy like me.

1004
01:23:49,227 --> 01:23:52,182
Did you find something here?
An envelope?

1005
01:23:52,304 --> 01:23:53,817
Yes. I've got it.

1006
01:23:53,944 --> 01:23:58,138
Don't you think we'd better destroy it
so it won't fall in the wrong hands?

1007
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:00,215
Open it.

1008
01:24:03,739 --> 01:24:06,204
There's nothing here but a $100 bill.

1009
01:24:06,336 --> 01:24:09,565
That's right. Will you see
that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?

1010
01:24:10,695 --> 01:24:12,648
Sure.

1011
01:24:14,093 --> 01:24:16,046
Take this away, will you?

1012
01:24:16,730 --> 01:24:19,482
Would you like me to move
the television set in here?

1013
01:24:19,609 --> 01:24:22,246
- You play gin rummy?
- I'm not very good at it.

1014
01:24:22,367 --> 01:24:26,199
- I am. Let me get the cards.
- You don't have to entertain me.

1015
01:24:26,325 --> 01:24:29,918
There's nothing I'd like better.
You know. Togetherness.

1016
01:24:30,044 --> 01:24:34,556
Guess what I did last Christmas. Had
dinner at the automat, went to the zoo,...

1017
01:24:34,681 --> 01:24:37,351
..then came home and cleaned up
after Mr. Eichelberger.

1018
01:24:37,479 --> 01:24:39,754
He had a little eggnog party here.

1019
01:24:39,879 --> 01:24:42,070
So I'm way ahead this year.

1020
01:24:42,195 --> 01:24:44,832
Three across. Spades double?

1021
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:46,909
High deals.

1022
01:24:47,553 --> 01:24:49,507
Six? Eight.

1023
01:24:57,187 --> 01:24:59,939
I think I'm gonna give it all up.

1024
01:25:01,146 --> 01:25:02,814
Give what up?

1025
01:25:05,743 --> 01:25:08,619
Why do people have to
love people, anyway?

1026
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:11,935
I know what you mean.

1027
01:25:15,059 --> 01:25:17,012
Queen.

1028
01:25:19,655 --> 01:25:22,009
- I don't want it.
- Pick a card.

1029
01:25:26,651 --> 01:25:30,846
What do you call it when somebody keeps
gettin' smashed up in car accidents?

1030
01:25:30,969 --> 01:25:34,116
- Bad insurance risk?
- That's me with men.

1031
01:25:35,726 --> 01:25:40,318
I was jinxed from the word go. First time
I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.

1032
01:25:40,443 --> 01:25:42,478
A cemetery?

1033
01:25:42,603 --> 01:25:45,240
I was 15. We used to go there to smoke.

1034
01:25:45,361 --> 01:25:49,316
His name was George and
he threw me over for a drum majorette.

1035
01:25:50,718 --> 01:25:52,672
Uh, gin.

1036
01:25:55,955 --> 01:26:01,025
That's 10, 20... 36.
And 25 makes 61 and two boxes.

1037
01:26:01,151 --> 01:26:03,141
I have this talent for falling in love...

1038
01:26:03,270 --> 01:26:06,578
..with the wrong guy
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

1039
01:26:07,309 --> 01:26:09,376
Well, how many guys were there?

1040
01:26:10,545 --> 01:26:12,298
Three.

1041
01:26:12,426 --> 01:26:16,210
The last one was the manager of a finance
company back home in Pittsburgh.

1042
01:26:16,342 --> 01:26:18,297
They found a shortage in his accounts.

1043
01:26:18,422 --> 01:26:22,014
He asked me to wait for him.
He'll be out in 1965.

1044
01:26:23,498 --> 01:26:25,453
Cut.

1045
01:26:26,097 --> 01:26:30,963
So I came to New York and moved in with
my sister and her husband, a cab driver.

1046
01:26:31,094 --> 01:26:35,767
They sent me to secretarial school and
then I applied for a job at Consolidated.

1047
01:26:35,891 --> 01:26:38,006
But I flunked the typing test.

1048
01:26:38,131 --> 01:26:40,802
- Too slow?
- No. I can type up a storm.

1049
01:26:40,928 --> 01:26:42,884
I just can't spell.

1050
01:26:43,887 --> 01:26:48,753
So they gave me a pair of white gloves
and stuck me in an elevator.

1051
01:26:48,886 --> 01:26:51,237
And that's how I met Jeff.

1052
01:26:52,403 --> 01:26:54,960
Oh God, I'm so fouled up.

1053
01:26:55,081 --> 01:26:57,389
What am I gonna do now?

1054
01:26:59,517 --> 01:27:01,633
Better win a hand. You're on a blitz.

1055
01:27:03,195 --> 01:27:05,947
Was he very upset when you told him?

1056
01:27:06,074 --> 01:27:08,029
Mr. Sheldrake? Yeah, very.

1057
01:27:09,272 --> 01:27:12,817
Maybe he does love me, only he doesn't
have the nerve to tell his wife.

1058
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:14,348
I'm sure that's it.

1059
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:17,699
- You really think so?
- No doubt about it.

1060
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:21,260
Would you hand me that pad and pencil?

1061
01:27:21,385 --> 01:27:24,297
- What for?
- I'm gonna write to Mrs. Sheldrake.

1062
01:27:24,424 --> 01:27:26,650
- You what?
- As one woman to another.

1063
01:27:26,781 --> 01:27:30,568
- I'm sure she'll understand.
- I don't think that's a very good idea.

1064
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:33,973
- Why not?
- For one thing, you can't spell.

1065
01:27:34,099 --> 01:27:38,054
Secondly, if you did something
like that, you'd hate yourself.

1066
01:27:39,176 --> 01:27:41,734
I don't like myself very much anyway.

1067
01:27:43,612 --> 01:27:45,921
Pick up the cards. Let's go.

1068
01:27:46,052 --> 01:27:49,007
- Do I have to?
- You bet. I got a terrific hand.

1069
01:27:55,486 --> 01:27:58,238
- You really wanna discard that?
- Sure.

1070
01:27:58,364 --> 01:28:00,115
Gin.

1071
01:28:02,721 --> 01:28:04,154
(Hums nervously)

1072
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:09,033
10, 20, 40, 52 and 25... 77.

1073
01:28:09,758 --> 01:28:13,066
Spades are double... 154.

1074
01:28:18,033 --> 01:28:19,987
Blitzed. Two games.

1075
01:29:18,759 --> 01:29:20,874
(Sylvia hums along to dance music)

1076
01:29:38,468 --> 01:29:40,422
(Doorbell)

1077
01:29:46,422 --> 01:29:49,571
- (Doorbell)
- All right, all right, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

1078
01:29:56,777 --> 01:29:58,527
- Hi, Baxter.
- What do you want?

1079
01:29:58,655 --> 01:30:00,610
What do I want? Just a minute.

1080
01:30:00,734 --> 01:30:03,293
- You can't come in!
- What's the matter with you?

1081
01:30:03,413 --> 01:30:05,402
I made a reservation for four o'clock.

1082
01:30:05,531 --> 01:30:07,760
You can't stay.
Take your champagne and go.

1083
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:11,278
I don't wanna pull rank on you,
but I told the little lady it was all set.

1084
01:30:11,409 --> 01:30:14,956
Are you gonna leave, Mr. Kirkeby,
or do I have to throw you out?

1085
01:30:15,884 --> 01:30:18,523
(Sniggers) Buddy-boy,
why didn't you say so?

1086
01:30:18,645 --> 01:30:21,872
- Got yourself a little playmate, huh?
- Now will you get out?

1087
01:30:22,002 --> 01:30:23,957
(Sylvia hums dance music)

1088
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:30,509
Hey, come on! What are we waiting for?
Open up, will you?

1089
01:30:30,638 --> 01:30:32,593
(Dr. Dreyfuss) Mildred!

1090
01:30:34,115 --> 01:30:38,390
- What's holding things up?
- Say, let's have a party, the four of us.

1091
01:30:38,512 --> 01:30:40,468
No!

1092
01:30:44,510 --> 01:30:46,737
(Sniggers) Well, I don't blame you.

1093
01:30:46,868 --> 01:30:49,744
So you hit the jackpot, eh, kid?
I mean Kubelik-wise.

1094
01:30:49,866 --> 01:30:52,219
Don't worry.
I won't say a word to anybody.

1095
01:30:52,585 --> 01:30:54,541
Stay with it, Buddy-boy.

1096
01:31:09,016 --> 01:31:10,971
Who was that?

1097
01:31:11,655 --> 01:31:15,009
Just somebody delivering
a bottle of champagne. Like some?

1098
01:31:15,852 --> 01:31:18,409
Would you mind opening that window?

1099
01:31:21,090 --> 01:31:26,206
- Now don't get any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
- I just want some fresh air.

1100
01:31:26,326 --> 01:31:29,555
It's only one storey down.
The best you could do is break a leg.

1101
01:31:29,684 --> 01:31:32,275
So they'll shoot me, like a horse.

1102
01:31:32,602 --> 01:31:35,831
Please, you gotta promise me
you won't do anything foolish.

1103
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:38,313
- Who'd care?
- I would.

1104
01:31:43,836 --> 01:31:47,587
Why can't I ever fall in love
with somebody nice like you?

1105
01:31:48,473 --> 01:31:50,427
Yeah. Well...

1106
01:31:51,073 --> 01:31:53,901
That's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise.

1107
01:31:55,229 --> 01:31:57,583
Go to sleep.

1108
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:35,368
- (Women) Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Miss Olsen, come into my office, please.

1109
01:32:44,413 --> 01:32:48,199
- Did you have a nice Christmas?
- Lovely. You were a great help!

1110
01:32:48,330 --> 01:32:50,888
Your pep talk to Miss Kubelik
at the office party.

1111
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:55,445
- Sorry, Jeff. I never could hold my liquor.
- I thought you could hold your tongue.

1112
01:32:55,568 --> 01:32:57,998
- It won't happen again.
- You bet it won't.

1113
01:32:58,125 --> 01:33:00,956
I'll arrange for you to get
a month's severance pay.

1114
01:33:01,084 --> 01:33:03,959
That's right, Miss Olsen.
I'm letting you go.

1115
01:33:04,683 --> 01:33:07,148
You let me go four years ago, Jeff.

1116
01:33:07,279 --> 01:33:11,510
And were cruel enough to make me sit out
there and watch the new models pass by.

1117
01:33:11,638 --> 01:33:14,672
I'd appreciate it if you'd be
out of here as soon as you can.

1118
01:33:14,795 --> 01:33:16,750
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

1119
01:33:25,190 --> 01:33:29,226
Operator, this is Mr. Sheldrake. I'd like
Mr. Baxter's home telephone number.

1120
01:33:29,347 --> 01:33:32,099
He's in Ordinary Premium Accounting.

1121
01:33:46,858 --> 01:33:50,291
- (Baxter) Hello?
- Hello. Jeff Sheldrake. Can you talk?

1122
01:33:51,015 --> 01:33:52,766
Yes. She's in the shower.

1123
01:33:52,894 --> 01:33:55,485
- She's coming along fine, considering.
- Good.

1124
01:33:55,612 --> 01:33:59,126
- Is there anything you need? Money?
- No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake.

1125
01:33:59,251 --> 01:34:02,286
As a matter of fact, I have
some money for you. $100.

1126
01:34:02,409 --> 01:34:03,760
Oh.

1127
01:34:03,887 --> 01:34:07,561
- If there's anything I can do for you...
- For me? I don't think so.

1128
01:34:07,685 --> 01:34:10,322
But I was hoping maybe
you could do something for her.

1129
01:34:10,604 --> 01:34:13,832
Like what? Put yourself
in my place, Baxter.

1130
01:34:13,962 --> 01:34:16,077
How can I help her? My hands are tied.

1131
01:34:17,321 --> 01:34:19,674
Well... at least you can talk to her.

1132
01:34:20,759 --> 01:34:24,190
Let me put her on. And please, be gentle.

1133
01:34:24,876 --> 01:34:27,262
There's a call for you!

1134
01:34:27,394 --> 01:34:29,749
- For me?
- Yeah. Mr. Sheldrake.

1135
01:34:31,632 --> 01:34:33,586
I don't wanna talk to him.

1136
01:34:33,711 --> 01:34:35,586
I think you should.

1137
01:34:35,711 --> 01:34:40,826
I gotta run down to the grocery anyway.
There's nothing left here but frozen pizza.

1138
01:34:41,626 --> 01:34:43,580
I'll be right back. OK?

1139
01:35:03,214 --> 01:35:05,168
Hello, Jeff.

1140
01:35:06,572 --> 01:35:09,607
- Yes, I'm all right.
- Why did you do it, Fran?

1141
01:35:09,731 --> 01:35:12,117
It's so childish,
and it never solves anything.

1142
01:35:12,249 --> 01:35:14,807
I oughta be very angry with you,
scaring me that way.

1143
01:35:14,927 --> 01:35:19,521
But let's forget the whole thing, pretend
it never happened. What do you say?

1144
01:35:19,644 --> 01:35:21,598
Fran?

1145
01:35:22,044 --> 01:35:24,475
Are you there, Fran?

1146
01:35:25,921 --> 01:35:30,230
Of course I'm not here, because
the whole thing never happened.

1147
01:35:30,358 --> 01:35:34,064
I never took those pills,
I never loved you,...

1148
01:35:34,196 --> 01:35:36,345
..we never even met.

1149
01:35:37,476 --> 01:35:41,352
- Isn't that the way you want it, Jeff?
- You know I didn't mean it that way.

1150
01:35:41,474 --> 01:35:44,189
You just get well.
Do what the nurse says. I mean Baxter.

1151
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:47,266
I'll see you as soon as I can.
Goodbye, Fran.

1152
01:36:04,858 --> 01:36:07,326
Hello, Mrs. Sheldrake. This is Miss Olsen.

1153
01:36:07,457 --> 01:36:11,448
Fine, thank you. I was wondering
if we could have lunch together.

1154
01:36:12,295 --> 01:36:15,841
I don't know how important it is,
but you might find it educational.

1155
01:36:15,972 --> 01:36:18,564
It concerns your husband.

1156
01:36:18,692 --> 01:36:22,237
All right. One o'clock,
Longchamps, Madison and 59th.

1157
01:36:28,285 --> 01:36:30,434
Don't worry. I'm on my way.

1158
01:36:30,565 --> 01:36:32,518
Just making a personal call.

1159
01:36:34,162 --> 01:36:36,117
Here's a dime.

1160
01:36:38,799 --> 01:36:40,278
Going down.

1161
01:36:52,150 --> 01:36:54,664
Oh, Mr. Baxter! I'm glad you're here.

1162
01:36:54,790 --> 01:36:57,301
- I was just going to get the passkey.
- What for?

1163
01:36:57,428 --> 01:37:00,145
I thought I smelled gas
coming from your apartment.

1164
01:37:00,267 --> 01:37:02,223
Gas?!

1165
01:37:10,942 --> 01:37:12,896
Miss Kubelik?

1166
01:37:14,699 --> 01:37:16,654
Miss Kubelik!

1167
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,955
- You all right?
- Sure!

1168
01:37:22,838 --> 01:37:25,870
- What's that funny smell?
- Gas! Didn't you turn it on?

1169
01:37:25,996 --> 01:37:28,871
Yes, to boil water to get
the coffee stains out of my dress.

1170
01:37:28,994 --> 01:37:32,268
- You turned it on but you didn't light it.
- Are you supposed to?

1171
01:37:32,392 --> 01:37:36,064
In this house you're supposed to.
Hey, what are you doing with that?

1172
01:37:36,190 --> 01:37:39,498
I was washing my stockings,
so I thought I'd wash your socks too.

1173
01:37:39,627 --> 01:37:43,619
- Oh. Thank you.
- Very curious. I could only find 3 pair.

1174
01:37:43,746 --> 01:37:46,133
Things are a little disorganised
around here.

1175
01:37:46,263 --> 01:37:49,970
I'd say. What's a tennis racket
doing in the kitchen?

1176
01:37:50,101 --> 01:37:54,809
Tennis racket? Oh, I remember.
I was cooking myself an ltalian dinner.

1177
01:37:54,939 --> 01:37:57,576
I used it to strain the spaghetti.

1178
01:37:57,697 --> 01:38:00,165
- Why not?
- In fact, I'm a pretty good cook.

1179
01:38:00,297 --> 01:38:02,968
- Only I'm a lousy housekeeper.
- Yes, you are.

1180
01:38:03,096 --> 01:38:07,325
When I was straightening up the couch,
I found six hairpins, a lipstick,...

1181
01:38:07,452 --> 01:38:10,963
..a pair of false eyelashes and
a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.

1182
01:38:11,088 --> 01:38:14,286
It's just that I'm the kind of guy
who can't say no.

1183
01:38:14,410 --> 01:38:18,319
- I don't mean to girls. I mean...
- To someone like Mr. Sheldrake.

1184
01:38:18,447 --> 01:38:21,401
- I guess so.
- I know so.

1185
01:38:23,043 --> 01:38:25,395
- He's a taker.
- What?

1186
01:38:25,961 --> 01:38:28,111
Some people take, some people get took.

1187
01:38:28,241 --> 01:38:32,117
And they know they're gettin' took
and there's nothin' they can do about it.

1188
01:38:32,238 --> 01:38:34,193
I wouldn't say that.

1189
01:38:34,918 --> 01:38:36,871
What would you like for dinner, huh?

1190
01:38:36,996 --> 01:38:40,066
Hey. Onion soup, and canned asparagus...

1191
01:38:40,195 --> 01:38:42,148
I really should be getting home.

1192
01:38:42,272 --> 01:38:45,149
- My family'll be flipping by now.
- You can't leave yet.

1193
01:38:45,272 --> 01:38:49,467
The doctor said it takes 48 hours
to get that stuff out of your system.

1194
01:38:50,509 --> 01:38:54,624
How long does it take to get someone
you're stuck on out of your system?

1195
01:38:54,746 --> 01:38:57,577
If only they'd invent
some kind of pump for that.

1196
01:38:57,704 --> 01:39:03,093
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You
think it's the end of the world. But it's not.

1197
01:39:03,221 --> 01:39:05,688
I went through exactly
the same thing myself.

1198
01:39:05,819 --> 01:39:07,694
- You did?
- Well, not exactly the same.

1199
01:39:07,819 --> 01:39:09,488
I tried to do it with a gun.

1200
01:39:09,616 --> 01:39:12,605
- Over a girl?
- Worse. It was the wife of my best friend.

1201
01:39:12,733 --> 01:39:17,566
And I was mad about her. But I knew
it was hopeless and I decided to end it all.

1202
01:39:17,691 --> 01:39:21,648
I went to a pawnshop and I bought a .45
automatic and I drove up to Eden Park...

1203
01:39:21,770 --> 01:39:23,804
- Do you know Cincinnati?
- No, I don't.

1204
01:39:23,928 --> 01:39:26,488
Anyway, I parked the car
and I loaded that gun...

1205
01:39:26,608 --> 01:39:30,803
You read in the papers that people shoot
themselves. Believe me, it's not that easy.

1206
01:39:30,924 --> 01:39:34,392
I mean, how do you do it?
Here? Here? Here?

1207
01:39:35,722 --> 01:39:38,280
- Know where I finally shot myself?
- Where?

1208
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,229
- Here.
- In the knee?!

1209
01:39:40,358 --> 01:39:42,791
Yeah! I was sittin' there, tryin' to decide.

1210
01:39:42,918 --> 01:39:45,191
A cop came up because
I was illegally parked.

1211
01:39:45,316 --> 01:39:48,544
I tried to hide the gun
under the seat and it went off.

1212
01:39:48,674 --> 01:39:52,189
- That's terrible!
- It was a year till I could bend the knee.

1213
01:39:52,313 --> 01:39:55,302
But I got over the girl in three weeks.

1214
01:39:56,790 --> 01:40:00,417
Still lives in Cincinnati.
Has four kids and gained 20 pounds.

1215
01:40:00,548 --> 01:40:02,855
Sends me a fruitcake every Christmas.

1216
01:40:02,985 --> 01:40:05,340
Are you just making this up
to make me feel better?

1217
01:40:05,466 --> 01:40:07,420
Of course not! Here's the fruitcake.

1218
01:40:07,544 --> 01:40:09,659
- Do you wanna see my knee?
- No, thank you.

1219
01:40:09,783 --> 01:40:12,931
The fellas in the office might
get the wrong idea how I found out.

1220
01:40:13,061 --> 01:40:17,017
Let 'em! Look, I'm gonna cook dinner
for us. We'll have fruitcake for dessert.

1221
01:40:17,138 --> 01:40:20,252
You just sit there and rest.
You've done enough for today.

1222
01:40:20,375 --> 01:40:23,492
- Yes, Nurse.
- (Baxter hums opera music)

1223
01:40:37,706 --> 01:40:40,819
- Can I help you?
- I'm lookin' for Miss Kubelik.

1224
01:40:40,944 --> 01:40:45,935
- So am I. She didn't report this morning.
- She didn't? Who's in charge here?

1225
01:40:46,062 --> 01:40:50,256
That comes under General Office
Administration. Mr. Dobisch, 21st floor.

1226
01:40:50,378 --> 01:40:52,047
Thanks.

1227
01:40:54,456 --> 01:40:58,765
So I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and
guess who he's stashed in the bedroom.

1228
01:40:58,893 --> 01:41:00,120
- Who?
- Kubelik.

1229
01:41:00,253 --> 01:41:03,242
No kiddin'? Buddy-boy and Kubelik
having a little toot?

1230
01:41:03,371 --> 01:41:07,681
Toot? More like a lost weekend.
Neither of 'em showed up for work today.

1231
01:41:07,809 --> 01:41:09,399
AWOL, hm?

1232
01:41:09,528 --> 01:41:11,994
What gripes me is
they guzzled my champagne...

1233
01:41:12,125 --> 01:41:15,512
..while Sylvia and I wound up
at the Guggenheim Museum.

1234
01:41:17,123 --> 01:41:19,077
- Mr. Dobisch?
- Yeah.

1235
01:41:20,082 --> 01:41:24,117
I'm Karl Matuschka. My sister-in-law
runs one of the elevators. Fran Kubelik.

1236
01:41:24,239 --> 01:41:25,671
- Miss Kubelik?
- You know her?

1237
01:41:25,798 --> 01:41:29,505
Of course. We have a lot of employees,
but we're one big, happy family.

1238
01:41:29,636 --> 01:41:34,548
She lives with us, and my wife's nervous
cos Fran hasn't been home for two days.

1239
01:41:34,674 --> 01:41:35,992
That so?

1240
01:41:36,112 --> 01:41:39,067
So we wondered if somebody here
knew what happened to her.

1241
01:41:39,189 --> 01:41:40,589
I see.

1242
01:41:40,711 --> 01:41:44,178
What do you think, Al?
Can we help the man?

1243
01:41:44,306 --> 01:41:47,581
Why not? We don't owe
Buddy-boy anything.

1244
01:41:47,706 --> 01:41:51,060
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy
done for us lately?

1245
01:41:53,142 --> 01:41:55,415
Who is Buddy-boy?

1246
01:41:56,660 --> 01:41:58,615
(Hums opera music)

1247
01:42:18,608 --> 01:42:22,313
- Are we dressing for dinner?
- No. Just come as you are.

1248
01:42:22,445 --> 01:42:26,402
- You're pretty good with that racket.
- You should see my backhand.

1249
01:42:28,362 --> 01:42:31,238
Wait till you see me serve the meatballs.

1250
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:35,270
- Shall I light the candles?
- It's a must, gracious living-wise.

1251
01:42:35,398 --> 01:42:37,354
(Hums opera music)

1252
01:42:38,357 --> 01:42:39,708
# Meatball

1253
01:42:39,835 --> 01:42:41,790
(Hums)

1254
01:42:43,314 --> 01:42:44,869
Meatball

1255
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:46,948
(Baxter continues humming)

1256
01:42:52,473 --> 01:42:55,349
- You bought some napkins.
- Might as well go all the way.

1257
01:42:55,471 --> 01:42:57,425
(Baxter hums)

1258
01:42:58,630 --> 01:43:00,937
You know, I used to live
like Robinson Crusoe.

1259
01:43:01,068 --> 01:43:03,215
Shipwrecked, among eight million people.

1260
01:43:03,346 --> 01:43:06,381
And then one day I saw
a footprint in the sand...

1261
01:43:06,504 --> 01:43:08,459
..and there you were.

1262
01:43:09,344 --> 01:43:11,492
It's a wonderful thing, dinner for two.

1263
01:43:11,621 --> 01:43:15,328
- Do you usually eat alone?
- No. Sometimes I eat with Ed Sullivan.

1264
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:18,177
Or sometimes Dinah Shore
or Perry Como.

1265
01:43:18,298 --> 01:43:22,130
The other night it was Mae West.
She was much younger then. Cheers.

1266
01:43:22,257 --> 01:43:24,971
- Cheers.
- Know what we're gonna do after dinner?

1267
01:43:25,134 --> 01:43:27,123
- The dishes.
- I mean after that.

1268
01:43:27,253 --> 01:43:29,447
- What?
- You don't have to if you don't want to.

1269
01:43:29,572 --> 01:43:31,878
- Oh, I don't?
- We're gonna finish the gin game.

1270
01:43:32,010 --> 01:43:34,568
- So keep a clear head.
- (Doorbell)

1271
01:43:35,369 --> 01:43:39,244
Cos I don't wanna take advantage of you,
the way I did yesterday in bed.

1272
01:43:39,365 --> 01:43:41,400
- Baxter?
- Yes.

1273
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:52,751
What's with you, Fran?
Did you forget where you live?

1274
01:43:52,879 --> 01:43:56,425
- My brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
- Oh! How do you do, Mr. Matusch...

1275
01:43:56,557 --> 01:44:00,785
- Get dressed. I got the cab downstairs.
- Wait. I know what you're thinking, but...

1276
01:44:00,912 --> 01:44:03,585
It's none of my business
what you do. You're over 21.

1277
01:44:03,712 --> 01:44:07,179
- But your sister thinks you're a lady.
- All we were gonna do was eat!

1278
01:44:07,310 --> 01:44:09,697
If there wasn't a lady present,
I'd clobber you.

1279
01:44:09,828 --> 01:44:12,580
All right, Karl! I'll get dressed.

1280
01:44:21,421 --> 01:44:23,376
Want a martini?

1281
01:44:27,219 --> 01:44:30,924
How about some spaghetti
with meat sauce that I cooked myself?

1282
01:44:36,212 --> 01:44:38,883
Your sister-in-law sure is terrific.

1283
01:44:42,010 --> 01:44:46,364
It must be murder drivin' a cab
in New York with the cross-town traffic.

1284
01:44:46,487 --> 01:44:48,442
(Door opens)

1285
01:44:50,645 --> 01:44:52,599
Hi, Baxter. How's the patient?

1286
01:44:52,725 --> 01:44:54,634
Oh, uh... I'm fine, Doc.

1287
01:44:54,764 --> 01:44:56,716
Not you. Miss Kubelik.

1288
01:44:57,440 --> 01:45:02,193
- What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
- This is Mr. Matuschka. He's... got a cab.

1289
01:45:03,319 --> 01:45:05,672
- Fran been sick?
- No. Just a little accident.

1290
01:45:05,798 --> 01:45:09,583
- What does he mean, accident?
- Well... these things happen all the time.

1291
01:45:09,715 --> 01:45:11,783
What things? What kind
of a doctor are you?

1292
01:45:11,914 --> 01:45:14,984
Not that kind! He just gave her
a shot, pumped out her stomach.

1293
01:45:15,112 --> 01:45:18,182
- What for?
- I took sleeping pills. But I'm fine now.

1294
01:45:18,310 --> 01:45:20,776
- Why'd you take sleeping pills?
- On account of me.

1295
01:45:20,908 --> 01:45:22,863
You?

1296
01:45:22,987 --> 01:45:24,704
Who else?

1297
01:45:29,383 --> 01:45:31,338
Leave him alone!

1298
01:45:33,621 --> 01:45:36,770
Oh, you fool. You damn fool.

1299
01:45:38,818 --> 01:45:41,775
- (Karl) Come on, Fran.
- Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.

1300
01:45:47,494 --> 01:45:49,447
Goodbye, Doctor.

1301
01:45:51,292 --> 01:45:55,839
Well, I don't wanna gloat, but
just between us, you had it coming to you.

1302
01:45:56,528 --> 01:45:57,926
(Tuts)

1303
01:45:58,047 --> 01:46:00,844
You're gonna have a shiner tomorrow.

1304
01:46:00,966 --> 01:46:02,718
Let me get my bag.

1305
01:46:04,763 --> 01:46:06,719
Don't bother, Doc.

1306
01:46:06,843 --> 01:46:08,798
It doesn't hurt a bit.

1307
01:46:29,709 --> 01:46:31,936
Mr. Sheldrake's office? This is CC Baxter.

1308
01:46:32,067 --> 01:46:35,183
Please tell him I'd like to
come up and see him. It's important.

1309
01:46:35,306 --> 01:46:37,260
Will you call me back, please?

1310
01:46:39,943 --> 01:46:42,854
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1311
01:46:44,022 --> 01:46:45,976
All your troubles are over.

1312
01:46:47,139 --> 01:46:49,855
I'm gonna take Miss Kubelik
off your hands.

1313
01:46:50,657 --> 01:46:53,012
The plain fact is, I love her.

1314
01:46:53,895 --> 01:46:56,362
I thought you should be the first to know.

1315
01:46:56,494 --> 01:46:59,292
After all, you don't really
want her, and I do.

1316
01:46:59,413 --> 01:47:03,368
And though it may sound presumptuous,
she needs somebody like me.

1317
01:47:03,490 --> 01:47:06,798
- So I think it would be best all around.
- (Phone rings)

1318
01:47:06,928 --> 01:47:08,324
Solution-wise.

1319
01:47:08,447 --> 01:47:09,674
Yes?

1320
01:47:09,807 --> 01:47:11,874
I'll be right up.

1321
01:47:12,004 --> 01:47:15,235
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1322
01:47:15,364 --> 01:47:17,318
All your troubles are over.

1323
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:23,588
19.

1324
01:47:23,719 --> 01:47:27,265
- Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
- Hit by a swinging door?

1325
01:47:27,396 --> 01:47:30,193
- Or a yellow cab?
- That guy really must've belted him.

1326
01:47:30,314 --> 01:47:33,385
Yeah. He's punchy. Talking to himself.

1327
01:47:33,633 --> 01:47:34,951
27.

1328
01:47:35,072 --> 01:47:37,425
Those two days
she spent in the apartment...

1329
01:47:37,550 --> 01:47:40,427
..made me realise
how lonely I'd been before.

1330
01:47:40,549 --> 01:47:43,936
But, thanks to you, I'm
in a financial position to marry her.

1331
01:47:44,066 --> 01:47:46,977
If I can ever square things with her family.

1332
01:47:47,106 --> 01:47:49,413
Good morning. CC Baxter.

1333
01:47:51,063 --> 01:47:53,097
(Intercom buzzer)

1334
01:47:53,221 --> 01:47:55,176
- Mr. Baxter is here.
- Send him in.

1335
01:47:57,339 --> 01:48:00,136
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1336
01:48:00,258 --> 01:48:02,292
And I've got good news for you, Baxter.

1337
01:48:02,416 --> 01:48:04,611
- All your troubles are over.
- Sir?

1338
01:48:04,937 --> 01:48:08,004
I know how worried you were
about Miss Kubelik. Stop worrying.

1339
01:48:08,134 --> 01:48:10,885
I'm going to take her off your hands.

1340
01:48:11,011 --> 01:48:13,808
- You're gonna take her off my hands?
- That's right.

1341
01:48:13,930 --> 01:48:16,284
I've moved out of the house.

1342
01:48:17,207 --> 01:48:20,083
I'm gonna be staying in town,
at the Athletic Club.

1343
01:48:20,206 --> 01:48:23,083
- You left your wife.
- If you must know, I fired my secretary.

1344
01:48:23,205 --> 01:48:27,831
My secretary got to my wife, and my wife
fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?

1345
01:48:27,961 --> 01:48:29,440
Yeah.

1346
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:31,390
Now what's your news, Baxter?

1347
01:48:33,479 --> 01:48:37,071
It's about Miss Kubelik. She's feeling
all right again so she went home.

1348
01:48:37,196 --> 01:48:40,153
Swell. And don't think
I've forgotten what you did for me.

1349
01:48:40,275 --> 01:48:42,229
This way, Baxter.

1350
01:48:45,512 --> 01:48:47,786
Sit down. Try it on for size.

1351
01:48:48,789 --> 01:48:51,222
- You like? It's all yours.
- Mine?

1352
01:48:51,349 --> 01:48:56,340
My assistant has been shifted to the
Denver office and you're taking his place.

1353
01:48:56,465 --> 01:48:58,818
What's the matter?
You don't seem very excited.

1354
01:48:58,945 --> 01:49:03,014
Well, it's just that so many things
have been happening so fast.

1355
01:49:03,143 --> 01:49:05,813
I'm very pleased.
Especially for Miss Kubelik.

1356
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:10,727
I think she's the kind of girl that definitely
ought to be married to... someone.

1357
01:49:10,857 --> 01:49:16,133
Sure, sure. But first the property has to be
settled. Then it takes six weeks in Reno.

1358
01:49:16,255 --> 01:49:19,050
Meanwhile I'm going to enjoy
being a bachelor for a while.

1359
01:49:19,172 --> 01:49:22,480
Oh, Baxter, you now can have lunch
in the executive dining room.

1360
01:49:22,611 --> 01:49:25,169
That's one of the privileges
that goes with this job.

1361
01:49:25,289 --> 01:49:29,723
You also get a nice little expense account,
use of the executive washroom...

1362
01:49:29,847 --> 01:49:32,153
Say, what happened to you, Baxter?

1363
01:49:32,284 --> 01:49:34,876
- I got kicked in the head too.
- Oh?

1364
01:49:55,111 --> 01:49:57,146
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.

1365
01:49:57,271 --> 01:49:58,704
Oh.

1366
01:49:58,830 --> 01:50:01,500
Miss Kubelik. How are you feeling?

1367
01:50:01,627 --> 01:50:04,220
- I feel fine. How's your eye?
- Oh, fine.

1368
01:50:04,348 --> 01:50:07,064
- How are things at the apartment?
- Nothing's changed.

1369
01:50:07,185 --> 01:50:10,017
- We never did finish that gin game.
- I know.

1370
01:50:11,663 --> 01:50:13,937
I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake.

1371
01:50:14,062 --> 01:50:16,526
Leaving his wife? Yeah.
I'm very happy for you.

1372
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:19,128
- I never thought he'd do it.
- I told you all along.

1373
01:50:19,259 --> 01:50:22,645
- You were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
- I guess so.

1374
01:50:22,776 --> 01:50:24,730
You were wrong about me too.

1375
01:50:24,855 --> 01:50:27,890
What you said about those who take
and those who get took.

1376
01:50:28,014 --> 01:50:31,083
Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me.
I was using him. See?

1377
01:50:31,211 --> 01:50:35,522
Last month I was at desk 861 on
the 19th floor. Now I'm on the 27th floor.

1378
01:50:35,650 --> 01:50:37,603
A panelled office, three windows.

1379
01:50:37,727 --> 01:50:40,639
So it all worked out fine.
We're both getting what we wanted.

1380
01:50:40,768 --> 01:50:43,563
Yes. Will you walk me to the subway?

1381
01:50:43,683 --> 01:50:49,119
No, thank you. Well, I... To tell you the
truth, I have this heavy date for tonight.

1382
01:50:52,478 --> 01:50:55,708
- Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
- No. You know how people talk.

1383
01:50:55,838 --> 01:51:00,908
I decided it was best not to see each other
until everything was settled, divorce-wise.

1384
01:51:01,034 --> 01:51:02,989
That's very wise.

1385
01:51:04,073 --> 01:51:06,427
- Good night, Mr. Baxter.
- Good night.

1386
01:51:40,972 --> 01:51:44,200
- Baxter, could you step in here a minute?
- Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

1387
01:51:44,331 --> 01:51:46,284
- There you are.
- Much obliged.

1388
01:51:48,088 --> 01:51:53,681
Here are the figures on staff turnover. 37%
of females leave to get married and 22%...

1389
01:51:53,804 --> 01:51:56,635
Baxter, you work too hard.
It's New Year's Eve. Relax!

1390
01:51:56,763 --> 01:51:59,638
- Yes, sir.
- I suppose you'll be celebrating tonight.

1391
01:51:59,762 --> 01:52:01,797
- Naturally.
- I'm taking Miss Kubelik out.

1392
01:52:01,961 --> 01:52:03,949
- I finally talked her into it.
- I see.

1393
01:52:04,078 --> 01:52:08,274
The only thing is, I'm staying at the
Athletic Club and it's strictly stag, so...

1394
01:52:08,396 --> 01:52:10,430
If you don't mind?

1395
01:52:11,195 --> 01:52:14,582
- Don't mind what?
- You know my key to your apartment?

1396
01:52:14,712 --> 01:52:17,826
When we had that little scare
about Miss Kubelik,...

1397
01:52:17,950 --> 01:52:21,781
- ..I threw it out the window of the train.
- Very clever.

1398
01:52:21,908 --> 01:52:24,102
So now I'll have to borrow your key.

1399
01:52:25,546 --> 01:52:28,264
- Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
- What do you mean, sorry?

1400
01:52:28,385 --> 01:52:30,692
You're not bringing anybody
to my apartment.

1401
01:52:30,823 --> 01:52:35,018
- It's not just anybody. It's Miss Kubelik.
- Especially not Miss Kubelik.

1402
01:52:35,140 --> 01:52:38,210
- How's that again?
- No key.

1403
01:52:40,018 --> 01:52:44,453
Baxter, I picked you for my team because
I thought you were a bright young man.

1404
01:52:44,575 --> 01:52:47,883
Do you realise what you're doing?
Not to me, but to yourself?

1405
01:52:48,014 --> 01:52:51,243
Normally it takes years
to work your way up to the 27th floor.

1406
01:52:51,372 --> 01:52:54,283
But it only takes 30 seconds
to be out on the street again.

1407
01:52:54,410 --> 01:52:56,875
- You dig?
- I dig.

1408
01:52:58,008 --> 01:52:59,962
So what's it going to be?

1409
01:53:06,483 --> 01:53:09,439
- Now you're being bright.
- Thank you, sir.

1410
01:53:26,152 --> 01:53:28,743
- Baxter, you gave me the wrong key.
- No, I didn't.

1411
01:53:28,871 --> 01:53:31,429
But this is the key
to the executive washroom.

1412
01:53:31,549 --> 01:53:35,176
That's right. I won't be needing it
because I'm all washed up around here.

1413
01:53:35,308 --> 01:53:38,580
- What's gotten into you?
- Just following doctor's orders.

1414
01:53:38,705 --> 01:53:42,776
I've decided to become a mensch.
Know what that means? A human being.

1415
01:53:42,902 --> 01:53:46,687
- Now hold on, Baxter.
- The old payola won't work any more.

1416
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:48,775
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

1417
01:54:17,202 --> 01:54:19,156
(Doorbell)

1418
01:54:22,919 --> 01:54:26,705
- We're having a party and ran out of ice.
- Sure, Doc.

1419
01:54:26,837 --> 01:54:28,872
How come you're alone
on New Year's Eve?

1420
01:54:28,996 --> 01:54:30,872
Well, I got things to do.

1421
01:54:30,995 --> 01:54:35,030
- What's this? You're packing?
- Yeah. I'm giving up the apartment.

1422
01:54:35,151 --> 01:54:36,949
Where are you moving to?

1423
01:54:37,072 --> 01:54:39,982
I don't know. All I know is
I gotta get outta this place.

1424
01:54:40,110 --> 01:54:42,065
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.

1425
01:54:42,189 --> 01:54:46,736
Me? Oh, my body. Don't worry, it'll go to
the university, Doc. I'll put it in writing.

1426
01:54:46,866 --> 01:54:49,934
- Could you use some champagne?
- Booze we don't need.

1427
01:54:50,064 --> 01:54:51,815
Say, why don't you join us?

1428
01:54:51,943 --> 01:54:56,730
We got two brain surgeons, a proctologist
and three nurses from Bellevue.

1429
01:54:56,859 --> 01:54:58,735
No, thanks. I don't feel like it.

1430
01:54:58,859 --> 01:55:02,930
In case I don't see you again, how much
do I owe you for taking care of that girl?

1431
01:55:03,056 --> 01:55:06,763
Forget it. I didn't do it as a doctor.
I did it as a neighbour.

1432
01:55:06,894 --> 01:55:09,452
By the way, whatever happened to her?

1433
01:55:10,691 --> 01:55:13,568
You know me with girls.
Easy come, easy go.

1434
01:55:13,691 --> 01:55:16,249
- Goodbye, Doc.
- Happy New Year.

1435
01:55:45,232 --> 01:55:46,504
(Lively music and chatter)

1436
01:55:57,785 --> 01:56:00,138
Sorry I took so long
on the phone. We're all set.

1437
01:56:00,263 --> 01:56:02,571
- For what?
- I rented a car. It'll be here at one.

1438
01:56:02,702 --> 01:56:05,454
- We're driving to Atlantic City.
- Atlantic City?

1439
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:09,934
I know it's a drag, but you can't find
a hotel room in town on New Year's Eve.

1440
01:56:10,937 --> 01:56:13,689
Ring out the old year, ring in the new.

1441
01:56:13,816 --> 01:56:15,929
Ring-a-ding-ding.

1442
01:56:16,414 --> 01:56:19,645
I didn't plan it this way. It's Baxter's fault.

1443
01:56:19,774 --> 01:56:20,727
Baxter?

1444
01:56:20,852 --> 01:56:24,239
He wouldn't give me
the key to the apartment.

1445
01:56:24,370 --> 01:56:26,836
- He wouldn't?
- No. He just walked out on me. Quit.

1446
01:56:26,969 --> 01:56:29,879
Threw that big, fat job right in my face.

1447
01:56:31,245 --> 01:56:35,157
- The nerve.
- The little punk. After all I did for him.

1448
01:56:35,284 --> 01:56:39,478
Said I couldn't bring anybody to the
apartment, especially not Miss Kubelik.

1449
01:56:39,601 --> 01:56:42,273
What's he got against you, anyway?

1450
01:56:42,401 --> 01:56:48,028
I don't know. I guess that's the way
it crumbles, cookie-wise.

1451
01:56:49,995 --> 01:56:52,347
What are you talking about?

1452
01:56:53,312 --> 01:56:56,587
I'd spell it out for you, only I can't spell.

1453
01:57:01,389 --> 01:57:06,254
(All) # Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1454
01:57:06,386 --> 01:57:11,094
# And never brought to mind...

1455
01:57:12,382 --> 01:57:14,338
Happy New Year, Fran.

1456
01:57:16,341 --> 01:57:20,536
# And days of auld lang syne

1457
01:57:21,378 --> 01:57:26,324
# For auld lang syne, my dear

1458
01:57:26,455 --> 01:57:31,286
# For auld lang syne

1459
01:57:31,411 --> 01:57:36,358
# We'll drink a cup of kindness yet

1460
01:57:36,569 --> 01:57:41,924
# For auld lang syne

1461
01:57:42,365 --> 01:57:44,320
(Cheering)

1462
01:57:47,323 --> 01:57:49,277
(Horns and whistles)

1463
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:55,153
Fran?

1464
01:57:56,398 --> 01:57:58,352
Where are you, Fran?

1465
01:58:13,467 --> 01:58:15,616
(Bang)

1466
01:58:15,748 --> 01:58:17,702
Mr. Baxter!

1467
01:58:17,985 --> 01:58:19,098
Mr. Baxter!

1468
01:58:19,463 --> 01:58:22,340
Mr. Baxter! Mr. Baxter!

1469
01:58:25,221 --> 01:58:26,494
Oh!

1470
01:58:26,620 --> 01:58:29,609
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1471
01:58:29,738 --> 01:58:32,092
Are you sure? How's your knee?

1472
01:58:32,816 --> 01:58:34,771
I'm fine all over.

1473
01:58:36,734 --> 01:58:40,007
- Mind if I come in?
- Of course not.

1474
01:58:43,612 --> 01:58:45,565
Let me get another glass.

1475
01:58:48,408 --> 01:58:50,442
- Where are you going?
- Who knows?

1476
01:58:50,565 --> 01:58:53,761
Another neighborhood,
another town, another job.

1477
01:58:53,885 --> 01:58:56,113
I'm on my own.

1478
01:58:56,243 --> 01:58:58,198
That's funny. So am I.

1479
01:58:59,362 --> 01:59:01,554
What'd you do with the cards?

1480
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:03,634
In there.

1481
01:59:14,513 --> 01:59:16,467
What about Mr. Sheldrake?

1482
01:59:16,591 --> 01:59:19,549
I'm gonna send him
a fruitcake every Christmas.

1483
01:59:21,908 --> 01:59:23,864
Cut.

1484
01:59:25,466 --> 01:59:27,421
I love you, Miss Kubelik.

1485
01:59:27,946 --> 01:59:29,696
Three.

1486
01:59:29,824 --> 01:59:30,972
Queen.

1487
01:59:31,103 --> 01:59:34,936
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik?
I absolutely adore you.

1488
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:39,455
Shut up and deal.
