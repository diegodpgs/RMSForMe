0
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,838
Timms,
they've got to understand.

1
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,866
My treatments
are making him smarter...

2
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,377
at an incredible rate.

3
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,471
It's more important
than training him for war.

4
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,709
You know our funding comes
from The Shop.

5
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,580
They want this animal trained
in virtual reality...

6
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:55,816
to use the infrared battle
helmet, not recite the ABCs.

7
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:58,255
I won't increase the dosage
of aggression drugs.

8
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,259
He's already been exhibiting
behavioral instability...

9
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:02,693
in the virtual battle
simulations.

10
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,698
What you're suggesting could
destroy his mind.

11
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,960
There is no choice, Larry.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,468
They don't care about
his intelligence enhancement.

13
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,231
They want his primal
rage centers fully stimulated.

14
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,795
He is to be battlefield ready.

15
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,704
Fucking screw
the political assholes.

16
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,232
He's the best chimp
I've ever had.

17
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,543
Battlefield simulation engaged.

18
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,640
Primate response optimum.

19
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,355
Threat.

20
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:41,458
Kill complete.

21
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,452
Let's go check out sector 10.

22
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,323
OK, level two.

23
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,090
Threat.

24
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,154
Targeting.

25
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,765
Acquire.

26
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:30,902
Acquire.

27
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,042
Acquire.

28
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,052
Attack.

29
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,213
Kill complete.

30
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,591
Evasive.

31
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:52,395
Security breach
inside Sector 14, Level 5.

32
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,093
14, Level 5.

33
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,395
Threat.

34
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,493
Evasive.

35
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,060
Threat.

36
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,197
Clear.

37
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:06,604
Check the upper building.
Go! Go!

38
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:19,958
Get over there.

39
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,461
Get over there on the double.

40
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,759
Evasive.

41
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,458
Non-threat.

42
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,330
Exit clear.

43
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,878
We have no visual indication...

44
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:48,012
that any incoming artillery
have arrived...

45
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,988
or, indeed, are on the way.

46
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:54,426
We can report the air raid
sirens are going off.

47
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,054
The military has been silent,
though a couple of hours ago...

48
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,462
we heard a huge noise...

49
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:03,094
and it was confirmed
that four KC-1...

50
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,936
KC-135 supertankers
had left the area.

51
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,669
These are the planes
that refuel...

52
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,836
other fighter planes
and bombers...

53
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,346
American bomber planes
over the area...

54
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,245
so they're in the air.

55
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,974
I'm trying to sleep, Larry.

56
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:48,207
I had a bad nightmare.

57
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:49,839
Really bad.

58
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:53,875
God, I hate it
when you smoke in bed.

59
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,848
Oh, Jesus.

60
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,504
What did you do that for?

61
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,169
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

62
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,948
Larry, what are you doing?

63
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,475
Answer the phone.

64
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,956
Yeah? Hello?

65
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,423
Larry, it's Timms.

66
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,925
Your chimp's dead.

67
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,587
It tried to escape.

68
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:36,652
When?

69
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,612
It wasn't a robot
we were building, Timms.

70
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,282
It was a living organism.

71
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,314
As the project supervisor and
the government liaison...

72
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,690
it was my responsibility...

73
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,718
to use the strongest
measures available.

74
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,289
Listen, I've warned you
about the aggression factors.

75
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,300
He just ran the program
we embedded.

76
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,393
Five years
of research down the drain.

77
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,802
We'll get you another chimp.

78
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,966
That chimp was the key to moving
on to a human subject.

79
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,169
Come in.
We'll talk about it.

80
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,006
I've had it.

81
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,413
I want to make something better
than a military weapon.

82
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,647
I'll just find funding in
the private sector, that's all.

83
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:36,120
You're not thinking
straight, Larry.

84
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,986
You signed ironclad
nondisclosures.

85
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,492
VSI owns it all.

86
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:44,929
Besides, it might not
be the healthiest thing to try.

87
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,124
You're talking about The Shop?

88
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,133
The puppet masters who pull
all the strings?

89
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,725
What, they own me?

90
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:54,138
They'll rub me out...
The Shop... if I don't comply?

91
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,868
You're being paranoid.

92
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,308
Your intelligence enhancement
work was brilliant.

93
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,641
No one's saying stop.

94
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:00,805
I am.

95
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,212
Larry, relax.

96
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,648
I know you're upset because
of what happened with the chimp.

97
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:07,244
Relax? They want
to suppress my work!

98
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:10,278
The potentials for
human advancement are endless!

99
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,520
Virtual reality holds a key
to the evolution of the mind...

100
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,322
and that's my focus.

101
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:16,487
This is something...

102
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,498
and we haven't
had something for a while.

103
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:22,501
There will be time
for all this, Larry.

104
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:26,494
You just have to play the game
a little longer.

105
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:31,101
That is how everything
finally gets done in this world.

106
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:37,378
Why don't you take a hiatus and
we'll restructure around here?

107
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,050
You can use the rest.

108
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,153
Take a hiatus.

109
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,980
Another hot one.

110
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,415
It's going to be a killer.

111
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,120
It's a long way up here.

112
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,467
Jobe!

113
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:38,632
Jobe, lad!

114
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,504
Ah, Jobe!

115
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:46,541
I feel like you
live in the top of a tree.

116
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,554
Come on, boy. Let's go.

117
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,783
Grass is waiting for you.

118
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,959
Oh, no.

119
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:01,626
Did me brother have you
doing penance all night again?

120
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,134
What did you do?

121
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,898
Nothing.

122
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,565
OK, well...

123
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,631
It's OK, Jobe boy.

124
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,642
It's OK. It's me, Terry.

125
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,645
Come on. Here.

126
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,203
Go get a shirt on,
then we'll go, OK?

127
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,074
What have we got here?

128
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,278
Well...

129
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,582
Oh, no.

130
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,614
Oh, my God,
would you look at this?

131
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,096
You finished Big Red.

132
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,097
Yeah.

133
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,100
Aye, you're magic
with a machine, boy.

134
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,931
Look at this.

135
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,699
Could we try it...
try it today, Terry?

136
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,502
I don't see why not.

137
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,108
Go fill up the gas can, Jobe.

138
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,137
Get me a candy bar.

139
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,620
Hey, Pop, could you
move that shit before Christmas?

140
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,149
Fill her up.

141
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,965
Hey, Jake, that's dangerous.

142
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,095
You forget who
you're talking to, half-wit?

143
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,606
That's dangerous.

144
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,666
Jobe, boy, go ahead
and finish what you're doing.

145
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,677
He's smoking, Terry.

146
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,269
That's right. I'm smoking.

147
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,803
Why don't you shut the fuck up
and fill your gas tank?

148
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,814
Jake, he don't mean no harm.

149
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,185
One of these fucking...

150
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,213
Jake, how's your old man doing?

151
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,748
Worse than ever!

152
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,727
Angelo is
like all brilliant types...

153
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,325
erratic.

154
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:48,329
But we tolerate them at The Shop
as long as they perform...

155
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,241
and Angelo
has certainly done that.

156
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:55,771
Project Five is very impressive.

157
00:11:55,815 --> 00:12:01,617
Mr. Director, without Angelo,
there is no Project Five.

158
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,521
Well, he'll be back...

159
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,956
one way...

160
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:06,980
or another.

161
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,608
Falling.

162
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,874
Rapid descent.

163
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,888
Flying.

164
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:10,455
God damn it, Caroline.

165
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,117
Never unplug a program
when I'm engaged.

166
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,218
You just
ruined the whole effect.

167
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:18,128
Falling, floating, and flying?

168
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,460
So, what's next, fucking?

169
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:26,894
What are you pissed off about?

170
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:30,602
You said you were
going to take me to the city...

171
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,477
but as usual you're hooked up
into that machine.

172
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,250
Well, why didn't you remind me?

173
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,082
I did.

174
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,385
Oh, babe, I'm sorry.

175
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,118
Oh, Caroline.

176
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,253
I'm sorry.

177
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:54,255
This is not a good time
for me right now.

178
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,131
I'm really sorry.

179
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,319
Get ready.
We can still get a hotel.

180
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,487
We don't need to go anywhere.

181
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,996
I'm ready right now.

182
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,191
Larry, I want to go.

183
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,298
I don't feel like
being around people right now.

184
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,001
I don't feel
like going to the city.

185
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,168
You never want to go anywhere.

186
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,169
Caroline... I need your support.

187
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,183
I'm going through
a lot of changes right now.

188
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,186
Well, I'm going
through a lot of changes, too.

189
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,678
You're too obsessed
with your work to even notice.

190
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,692
I'm young, Larry, OK?

191
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,854
And I'm not going to become
a recluse just for you.

192
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,559
I'm into reality reality,
not this artificial reality.

193
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:04,899
This technology
is going to change the world.

194
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:09,636
This is the future...
and you're afraid of it.

195
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,644
Yeah, well, it may be
the future to you, Larry...

196
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,839
but it's
the same old shit to me.

197
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,148
I give up.

198
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,746
Hey, Jobe!

199
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,593
Hi, Peter!

200
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,926
You've finished Big Red.

201
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,295
Hi, Jobe.

202
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,664
Hi, Mrs. Parkette.

203
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,363
Come over and have some Kool-Aid
with Peter when you're done.

204
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,133
Thanks, Mom!

205
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:17,904
Peter, look what I got you.

206
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,411
The Nuke Masters
special edition!

207
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:23,279
Yeah. It's 3-D, too.

208
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,805
But where are the glasses?

209
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,648
Glasses?

210
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:31,144
That's OK. I've got
a pair of my own anyway.

211
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,623
Look at the blades, man.

212
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,880
If you boys listen real careful,
you can hear the panpipes...

213
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,479
of the little people
in the grass there.

214
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,989
Right, Terry.

215
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,015
I hear them all the time.

216
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,157
Hi, Dr. Angelo.

217
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,561
Can we play
Cyber-Boogie today?

218
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,156
Yeah, sure.
That would be fine.

219
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:17,928
Damn.

220
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,370
Peter!
Get your ass over here!

221
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,397
I got to go.

222
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,842
Hi, Dad.

223
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,281
I told you not to leave
that fucking bike in my way!

224
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,181
Didn't I?

225
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,583
Sorry, Dad.

226
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,087
What is wrong with you?

227
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:39,181
Didn't I tell you not
to play with that moron anymore?

228
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,987
You want to get stupid?

229
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,391
Get in the house.
I'm tired of this shit.

230
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,417
Come on.

231
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:01,501
That boy
was told to take care of this.

232
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,015
He constantly shirks his duties.

233
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:08,850
Can't have these godless little
creatures at the altar.

234
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,821
It's sacrilege!

235
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,259
Where are you, boy?

236
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,098
You're never here
where you should be.

237
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,304
Four times in as many weeks...

238
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:38,111
he's forgotten his duty
to the parish!

239
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,981
He brings the wrath
of the Lord on himself...

240
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,610
just like his namesake.

241
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,113
Jobe, are you in there?

242
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,455
Answer me, boy!

243
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,763
God saw fit to make you
a ward of this church...

244
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,231
and you must earn your keep.

245
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:57,429
I've tried to teach that
stupid mind responsibility...

246
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,960
since you were five years old.

247
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:07,068
Which of God's lessons helps you
to remember best, Jobe?

248
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:46,448
I'll remember my chores,
Father, I promise!

249
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,417
Journal entry, May 1.

250
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:56,188
Work, marriage, life...
what a joke.

251
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,495
I'm going now, Larry.

252
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,197
My plane leaves in an hour.

253
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,672
It's better
for both of us this way.

254
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,540
Drinking all that whiskey isn't
going to help your depression.

255
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,010
It's probably going
to make it worse.

256
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,342
Yes, you're right, Caroline.

257
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,007
It is probably
going to make it worse.

258
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,176
Well, don't blame me.

259
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:23,518
You have no idea of what
I'm going through, do you?

260
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:27,685
My work is falling apart,
and you decide to leave me.

261
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,127
It's dead for both of us,
so why don't you give it up?

262
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:42,564
Good-bye, Larry.

263
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,178
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

264
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:50,681
Mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

265
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,708
now and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

266
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,416
Big Red.

267
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,757
Booting audio journal.

268
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,090
May 10 entry.

269
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,322
Recording.

270
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,828
Oh, Jesus...

271
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:44,358
this hiatus
is driving me insane.

272
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,574
When I think of what
I might have accomplished...

273
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,098
with a human subject.

274
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:57,244
I've got to find a way to
continue the work on my own.

275
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,250
There's so much to do.

276
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,445
I can't wait any longer.

277
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,468
Full.

278
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:31,912
Hi, Jobe.

279
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,542
Hi, Dr. Angelo.

280
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,815
How are you?

281
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,321
Looks like you're working hard.

282
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,291
Yeah. I'm a real hard worker.

283
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:43,522
Jobe, do you like to play games?

284
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:47,794
Yeah. Peter says
you have the best games.

285
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,859
I have a game in my house that
you might like to play.

286
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,392
Would you like that?

287
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,694
OK.

288
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:07,111
Remember, one of the
4 shapes on the bottom row...

289
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,210
You see them down there?

290
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,744
Matches one of the shapes
on the top row.

291
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,053
So put your finger on here...

292
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:18,495
and move that shape
to the question mark, all right?

293
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:20,961
Incorrect.

294
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,800
Try again.

295
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,498
OK, here we go.

296
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,502
There.

297
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:32,942
There.

298
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,275
Incorrect.

299
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:35,609
Don't worry.

300
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:38,343
Take your time. Here we go.

301
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:43,980
Correct answer.

302
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:45,649
You did it. Very good.

303
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,885
Let's play another game.

304
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:52,162
Come here, Peter. Come here!

305
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:53,687
I'm going to get you, Peter.

306
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:54,994
All right.

307
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,295
Look at that!

308
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:57,631
Let's go.

309
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,637
Watch out! Holy moley!

310
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,639
Come on, Peter. Slow down.

311
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,664
I'm going to hit the wall.

312
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,141
I'm getting dizzy.

313
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,213
Peter, wait!

314
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,957
Come on, Peter. Come on back.

315
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,431
Peter, I'm getting scared.

316
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,504
Game over.

317
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,140
Why don't you go upstairs
and get some drinks?

318
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,953
Hey, Jobe. It's OK.

319
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,788
It's just a game.

320
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,794
I was really bad.

321
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,820
Well, you'll get used to games.

322
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,632
Thanks, Peter.

323
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,467
Hey, Jobe.

324
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,167
Hey.

325
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,478
I was flying upside-down,
Dr. Angelo.

326
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,309
Come on. Hop up.

327
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,813
Come over here.

328
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,511
Sit down.

329
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,680
You know, Jobe...

330
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:32,789
I have other... different games.

331
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:36,892
I even have one that
could help make you smarter.

332
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,432
I was born dumb.

333
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:46,433
But... you would like
to be smarter, wouldn't you?

334
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,316
I don't know.

335
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:57,811
Well, if you were smarter,
people wouldn't be able to...

336
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,017
take advantage of you.

337
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:04,321
Do you
understand what I mean, Jobe?

338
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:07,195
- Yeah.
- And?

339
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,496
Sometimes they do.

340
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:10,865
They do.

341
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,370
Can you keep a secret?

342
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:25,880
Well...
I'll tell you one.

343
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,521
I can make you smarter...

344
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,352
but only if you want.

345
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,449
And you must never
tell anyone.

346
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:40,554
You mean a secret
for just you and me two?

347
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:42,863
That's right.

348
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,605
Well, I bet you
already know, don't you?

349
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,404
So don't you tell anybody, OK?

350
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,432
OK?

351
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:19,295
Well, you're
as healthy as a mule.

352
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,567
When can we play the games?

353
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:23,403
Soon, Jobe.

354
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:27,172
I need to give you
a shot of vitamins first.

355
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,840
I had a shot once,
Dr. Angelo, and it hurt.

356
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:31,849
This won't.

357
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:34,875
Trust me.
I'm very good at this.

358
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,552
That looks like a gun.

359
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:46,224
OK, just relax your arm.
Relax your arm. Relax.

360
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:49,529
Look over there.
Look over there.

361
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,396
It didn't hurt.

362
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,906
Just relax.

363
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:03,402
Your head's going to be
a blank for a while.

364
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:04,415
All right?

365
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,575
Yeah.

366
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:06,914
Just breathe now.

367
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:07,918
Too dark.

368
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:09,920
No, it's not
going to be in a while.

369
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,888
Just breathe and relax.
That's it.

370
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,754
In a while,
it's going to be like...

371
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,692
being up there
with the stars, Jobe.

372
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,490
Like going to another planet.

373
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:21,590
You're going to feel a tingling
sensation in your hands...

374
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,260
but don't panic.

375
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:24,632
It's OK.
I'm right here with you.

376
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,637
It's all part of the game.

377
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,832
OK, here we go.

378
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:38,371
Cortex stimulation engaged.

379
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:42,779
Brain stem strobe enabled.

380
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,085
Is that my hand?

381
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,884
It's going to hit me!

382
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,020
No, it's not going to hit you.

383
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,428
Just relax. Just breathe.

384
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,561
Strobe velocity increasing.

385
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:14,545
Journal entry, May 10.

386
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,554
The electrochemistry
of his brain...

387
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,715
has responded
better than I'd expected.

388
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,725
I'm going to step up
the virtual treatments...

389
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,818
and increase the dosage
of nootropic drugs.

390
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,064
I should see escalations
in his brain patterns...

391
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,066
by the end of the week.

392
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,432
It's too late to turn back now.

393
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,177
Jobe, what's the matter?

394
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,145
I'm hungry.

395
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,011
Well, go eat.

396
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:35,730
His mind is
like a clean, hungry sponge.

397
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:42,363
Synaptic activity has increased
400% in less than a month.

398
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,803
His human brain is responding
to the nootropics...

399
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:52,647
and virtual stimulation more
rapidly than my animal subjects.

400
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:55,118
Go on! Go faster, Peter!

401
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,815
Go on!
I can catch you right now!

402
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,660
Come on and get me, Peter!

403
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,687
Come on!

404
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,026
I'm going to get you now!

405
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:16,029
You better not get too excited
'cause I'm getting you!

406
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:18,042
Look right there!

407
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,199
Come on!

408
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,205
I got you!

409
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:31,485
Game over.

410
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:33,285
Yes! You nailed it, Jobe!

411
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:34,621
You nailed it!

412
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,149
Whoa, that was sketched.

413
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,496
Finally some real competition.

414
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:43,022
Yeah, he got you that time,
didn't he, Peter?

415
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:45,968
Congratulations.

416
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:49,132
You just graduated
to the next level, Jobe.

417
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,767
Hi.

418
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,873
You got a horse?

419
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,773
What are you doing?

420
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:33,580
Why are you standing there
half-naked, exposing yourself?

421
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,950
What sort of perverted
behavior is this?

422
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:39,650
You should knock before
you come into somebody's house.

423
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,022
This is my house.

424
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:44,119
I pay the rent, and
I want to cash my checks now...

425
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:45,527
because I want to buy
some new clothes.

426
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:47,190
And I'm going
to buy some cowboy boots...

427
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:50,166
and I'm going to make
this place a ranch.

428
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:52,226
It's that Dr. Angelo, isn't it?

429
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,738
He's been feeding
the Devil in your head!

430
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:56,103
No, he hasn't!

431
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,664
I'll see to that.

432
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:07,012
You know,
you shouldn't hit people.

433
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:27,197
You shouldn't
hit people like that.

434
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,018
Very impressive.

435
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:49,356
Did you use the Project 5
formulas on this subject?

436
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:52,192
As a base.

437
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,697
But I've totally reconfigured...

438
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:55,699
both the nootropic and
the cyberlearning programs...

439
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:57,860
without aggression factors.

440
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,836
Of course.
That only makes sense.

441
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,238
I can't believe you
went ahead and did this, Larry.

442
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:04,434
Look at the comparisons.

443
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:07,410
It works
with a human subject, Timms.

444
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:17,443
It's incredible work, Larry.

445
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:22,081
So... what do you say?

446
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:25,095
I've gone as far
as I can in my lab at home.

447
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:27,996
I need access
to the main lab to go further.

448
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:30,398
There's no telling
how far I can take Jobe.

449
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,461
I can't do this
without your help.

450
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:45,508
What's it going to be,
Ms. Burke?

451
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,348
Would you check my fluids, Jake?

452
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,203
Do I know you?

453
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,441
I mow your lawn.

454
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:21,680
No. You're not
the Lawnmower Man.

455
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,983
Well... wow.

456
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:25,716
You've certainly changed.

457
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:28,554
I don't know how you did it,
but I approve.

458
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:31,391
Ms. Burke, I filled her up
with trans fluid.

459
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,453
No charge.

460
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:33,964
Thanks, Jake.

461
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:35,329
You're welcome.

462
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:39,900
Well, I'm looking forward
to having my lawn mowed...

463
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:41,029
soon.

464
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:55,207
She's got the hots
for you, Jobe boy.

465
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:58,017
You got to be kidding me.

466
00:35:58,055 --> 00:35:59,682
She's just teasing
this half-wit.

467
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:02,124
Look at him. You got him
dressed up like a fool.

468
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,594
I've known her
ever since her husband died.

469
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:07,063
She's been kicking up her heels
with all the young studs.

470
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,498
And I tell you,
she wants this young fella.

471
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,468
Don't you call her no whore
around me, old man.

472
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,969
Whores do it for money.

473
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,471
She's got money. She's young.

474
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,973
She does it 'cause she likes it.

475
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,976
I told you to shut up.

476
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,944
Hey, Jake, don't do that.

477
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:22,639
OK, Lawnmower Man.

478
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:41,892
Dr. Angelo, I think people
can tell that...

479
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,764
that I'm changing.

480
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:48,370
Just don't draw attention
to yourself, OK?

481
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,874
Just keep doing
the lawn job for now.

482
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:52,739
It's not going to last forever.

483
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:55,211
I like doing the lawns.

484
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,213
That's good.

485
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:57,737
I always liked doing them.

486
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:58,840
That's good.

487
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,947
You're cleared. Go ahead.

488
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,420
Why is this place
so far from town?

489
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:07,686
The work here at VSI
is government classified.

490
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,955
Top Secret.

491
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:21,928
Good afternoon, Dr. Angelo.

492
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,966
Looks like a dungeon
in here, Dr. Angelo.

493
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,787
You see this, Jobe?

494
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,190
Holy moley!

495
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:02,441
Come on. It's OK.

496
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,176
Look.

497
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:16,653
This is some of the most
advanced computer equipment...

498
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:17,956
in the world, Jobe.

499
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:20,964
In these gyrospheres,
we wear full cybersuits...

500
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:24,399
which allow us to enter
into virtual reality and move.

501
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:26,767
Your entire nervous system
and endocrine system...

502
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,272
will be in sync
with the brain expansion.

503
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,706
Endocrine?

504
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,266
Endocrine: it carries
secretions of certain glands...

505
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,779
like the thyroid, adrenal,
and pituitary...

506
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,974
which regulate growth.

507
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,814
Sometimes...

508
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,449
I think I've discovered
a new planet...

509
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,482
but one I'm inventing
instead of discovering.

510
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:55,322
I've just sighted the shore
of one of its continents.

511
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,803
Booting biology systems
readouts.

512
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,498
Bio-monitors on.

513
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,676
Choice.

514
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,876
Graph 5... engage.

515
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:18,784
Change brain wave parameters.

516
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,053
Brain wave pattern altered.

517
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,215
Prepare brain stem injection.

518
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:01,687
Initiate brain stem.

519
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,999
Insertion complete.

520
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:09,699
Let me off! Dr. Angelo!

521
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:16,108
Synaptic reaction positive.

522
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,479
My head, Dr. Angelo!

523
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,183
I like it!

524
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,330
Change brain wave parameters.

525
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:45,506
Initiate second level.

526
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,136
Insertion complete.

527
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:26,443
Lemonade.

528
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,146
Think he likes lemonade?

529
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:40,225
It's so hot today, Jobe.

530
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:42,994
Why don't you come up
for a cold glass of lemonade?

531
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:46,127
Oh, Jesus, Mother of God,
would you look at that?

532
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:51,634
Go on, you dolt!

533
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:52,664
Go on!

534
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:07,951
Jobe, have you
ever kissed a girl before?

535
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:13,293
Really?

536
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,292
Give me your tongue.

537
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,462
Give me your tongue.

538
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:40,316
Soft.

539
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:43,357
Hard.

540
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:24,258
He absorbed Latin yesterday
in less than two hours.

541
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:27,759
It took me a year just
to learn the Latin alphabet.

542
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:29,136
God damn,
Larry, I am speechless.

543
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:32,267
I think it's time we brought
this out of the closet...

544
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:33,537
and report
these results directly...

545
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:36,546
to the Department of Scientific
Intelligence in Washington.

546
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,548
DSI is bound
to offer you both tits.

547
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:40,550
The timing isn't right.

548
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:42,279
There's some factors that need
ironing out.

549
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,786
Iron them out.

550
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:48,884
I'm not going to be able to keep
this quiet much longer.

551
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:50,917
The historical perspective
of expressionism,

552
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,452
as typified by
Van Gogh and Gauguin...

553
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:17,420
Rhythm and blues. You like it?

554
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:18,421
Yeah, sure.

555
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:19,945
I like it.

556
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:24,160
Classical.

557
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:27,061
You should try
listening to a whole tune once.

558
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:28,325
You might like it.

559
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:29,832
Too much to hear.

560
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:32,358
I get it all by sampling
segments, anyway.

561
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,240
Who taught you how to drive?

562
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:38,263
Me!

563
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,904
There you go. Enjoy yourselves.

564
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:43,879
Jim, you need anything else?

565
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:49,411
Hi, Dolly!

566
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:52,445
Hi, Jobe.
I'll be right with you.

567
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:58,762
Don't you want to check out
the comics first?

568
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:00,263
I gave them up, Peter.

569
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:01,423
No way!

570
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:05,765
Matter of fact, I got my whole
collection in that crate...

571
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:07,100
and I'm giving it to you.

572
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:08,104
Whoa, awesome! Dudical!

573
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:10,129
Order me fries
and a Coke, all right?

574
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,440
Are you all right?

575
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,614
I don't got time for this.

576
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:26,054
I hope he doesn't puke
on the counter.

577
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,489
What's wrong with that fool?

578
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:30,288
He's probably been taking dope.

579
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,756
Look at that guy!

580
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:39,160
Weirdo.

581
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:41,728
Whatever the hell's
his problem?

582
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,034
Probably dancing
with the booze lady.

583
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,200
He's having a breakdown.

584
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,436
Oh, man!

585
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:55,085
Are you all right, Jobe?

586
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,950
Peter, I got to go.

587
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,801
The things that people think.

588
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:18,297
I had to use all
my concentration to block it.

589
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:20,810
I don't want it
to happen again...

590
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:23,176
because if it does,
I think I would go crazy.

591
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:26,983
It's amazing.

592
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:28,985
Even with
the treatments stopped...

593
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:32,318
your abilities
continue to change and grow.

594
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:35,814
I speculated that if
psychic powers existed...

595
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:38,828
this research would be
the key to unlocking them.

596
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:41,330
But this is beyond
anything I ever expected.

597
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:44,334
I mean,
like the accelerated learning.

598
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:46,836
The results are
completely unexpected.

599
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,030
Completely.

600
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:53,175
Well... don't worry, Jobe.

601
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:54,871
I'll sort something out.

602
00:46:57,447 --> 00:46:59,711
I've got to keep this psychic
development quiet...

603
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,012
especially from Timms.

604
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,245
Who's Timms?

605
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:08,717
I'm preparing Angelo to present
his results to you personally...

606
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:11,728
as you've requested.

607
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:13,730
He's met
with incredible success.

608
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:18,064
Precisely why we feel it's time
for you to guide his efforts...

609
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:19,932
in a specific direction.

610
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:23,072
Which direction is that?

611
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:25,574
We're most anxious
to see what effect...

612
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:28,134
the original Project 5
formulas will have...

613
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,806
on this subject.

614
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:35,808
Mr. Director, the aggression
vectors in Project 5 caused...

615
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,151
That was an ape, Timms.

616
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:42,648
We want to know what effect it
will have on a human subject.

617
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,161
It's an essential step
for us to determine...

618
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:49,063
certain covert sector
applications for Angelo's work.

619
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:53,661
It will be difficult
in the extreme...

620
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:57,333
to convince Angelo to reinstate
the original formulas.

621
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:03,108
Then you'll have to
be persuasive in the extreme.

622
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,307
Run batch 505.

623
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,840
Program change initiated.

624
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:26,222
Initiate brain stem.

625
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:33,000
Brain wave pattern altered.

626
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,802
Can you hear me, Jobe?

627
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:40,810
Relax.

628
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:42,175
Shut down theta stimulation.

629
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:46,005
I'm coming over. Stay there.

630
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:51,146
Warning. Endocrine, adrenal,
increasing to fatal levels.

631
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,224
System shutdown.

632
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:10,304
I saw God!

633
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,331
I touched God!

634
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:18,837
I was pushing.

635
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:21,350
I didn't even think
of Jobe's safety.

636
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,376
That amount of brain swelling
should have killed him.

637
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:27,982
Instead, it completely
disappeared, leaving no lesions.

638
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,516
Somehow the experiment
is out of my control.

639
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,788
I'm stopping the treatments...

640
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:33,659
until I can figure out
what went wrong.

641
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:06,455
Confessions.

642
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:08,088
Eavesdrop on real people...

643
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:10,429
telling their innermost
secrets, darkest desires.

644
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,264
I saw this woman today.

645
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:14,236
I couldn't help myself.

646
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:23,068
God, he smells good.

647
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:27,106
I want to get him up
for something strange tonight.

648
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:30,051
I can read your mind.

649
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,076
Oh, right.

650
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:37,120
You sure have some
strange fantasies.

651
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,720
Come with me.

652
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,697
Let's live a little...

653
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,936
Jobe, it's so huge in here.

654
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,399
This will be the best ride
of your life, Marnie.

655
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:57,277
You're the best ride of my life.

656
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:06,417
In here we can be
anything we want to be.

657
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,947
I'll see you on the inside.

658
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:33,609
Wow! It's my hands!

659
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,287
Look at this!

660
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,948
Oh, my God!

661
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,690
Jobe, where are you?

662
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,752
I'm right here, Marnie.

663
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,697
Come over here.

664
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,493
You're beautiful.

665
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,366
I'm stuck.

666
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:36,572
I'm stuck in this stuff, Jobe.

667
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,513
It's from our primal mind.

668
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,675
I don't like it, so let me up.

669
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,584
Jobe, let me up!

670
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,609
Now!

671
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:48,620
Nothing can
hurt us in here.

672
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,592
Jobe, you're scaring me.

673
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:52,254
I want out!

674
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:54,263
I know what you really want.

675
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:55,264
Watch this.

676
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:58,495
Oh, my God! What are you doing?

677
00:53:58,535 --> 00:53:59,934
Jobe, what are you doing?

678
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,801
What are you doing?

679
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:04,233
Oh, my God, let me up!

680
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:10,010
Oh, God!

681
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:22,420
Warning:
brain pattern abnormal.

682
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:27,421
Automatic system shutdown.

683
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:35,527
Marnie, are you OK?

684
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:43,378
Marnie, I couldn't stop.

685
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:49,774
Dr. Angelo said
nothing could happen.

686
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,515
I didn't mean to hurt you!

687
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:40,025
What did Dr. Angelo do to me?

688
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:43,968
I have to find out.

689
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:49,035
I can't fly to fucking
Washington tomorrow!

690
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:50,546
I told you...

691
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:54,277
I have to resolve some problems
before presenting my work.

692
00:55:54,317 --> 00:55:57,878
This is premature.
I'm not ready.

693
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:59,786
You're ready enough.

694
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:00,790
Oh, shit.

695
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:01,791
Be reasonable.

696
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:04,259
I can't keep
this secret any longer.

697
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:08,458
We can't cut ourselves off
from the hand that feeds us.

698
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:20,965
I thought you
were doing lawns today.

699
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,342
I wish I were.

700
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:18,731
Mind over matter, Dr. Angelo.

701
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,633
Not a miracle.

702
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:22,838
A fact.

703
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:25,807
I have to run some tests.

704
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,144
Get a clearer picture.

705
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,416
This is all so new.

706
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,645
It's not new.

707
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:38,950
I realize that
nothing we've been doing is new.

708
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:43,425
We haven't been tapping
into new areas of the brain.

709
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,452
We've just been
awakening the most ancient.

710
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:48,760
This technology is simply
a route to powers...

711
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:53,667
that conjurers and alchemists
used centuries ago.

712
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:55,671
The human race
lost that knowledge...

713
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:58,367
and now I'm reclaiming it
through virtual reality.

714
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:00,308
You're moving too fast.

715
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:03,779
Even with all these new
abilities, there are dangers.

716
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:07,715
Man may evolve a thousandfold
through this technology...

717
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:11,277
but the rush must
be tempered with wisdom.

718
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:22,219
You're trying to get
inside my head, Jobe.

719
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:24,529
I can feel you pushing.

720
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:26,398
You realize, Dr. Angelo...

721
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:29,132
that my intelligence
has surpassed yours...

722
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:32,471
and I can't allow your fear
of what you don't understand...

723
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,977
to get in the way of this work.

724
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,275
The treatments have to continue.

725
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:40,540
We have no choice.

726
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:44,111
I was terrified of him.

727
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:48,447
I'm sure he knew it.

728
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:54,119
He surpassed me, all right.

729
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:59,761
But his insights seem...

730
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:00,962
twisted.

731
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:06,066
I fear for Jobe's sanity.

732
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,441
This Washington trip couldn't
come at a worse time.

733
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,439
So as you can see, the results
with this one human subject...

734
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:18,443
indicate unlimited applications
for mental disability alone...

735
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:23,482
such as retardation,
Alzheimer's.

736
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:28,122
And the possibilities
for education are staggering.

737
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:31,622
With the proper funding,
we could perfect this...

738
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:33,135
within the year.

739
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:35,137
Right.

740
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:36,570
Any questions?

741
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:47,048
The Director wants to know...

742
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,483
if you've noticed
any significant changes...

743
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:51,987
since the Project 5
formula was reinstated.

744
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:54,751
We only reinstated
those formulas a few days ago.

745
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:57,123
Not enough time
for any findings.

746
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,627
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

747
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:02,062
I was going to speak with you
about this after the meeting.

748
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:04,066
The Shop requested
that we resume...

749
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,125
the original Batch 5 with Jobe.

750
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:08,399
You idiot.
You goddamn idiot!

751
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,406
Do you know
what you have done?

752
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,931
There is no telling what
the Project 5 abstract...

753
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:14,238
will do to a human being.

754
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,539
Do you understand me?

755
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:17,478
What Project 5
will do to a human...

756
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:19,674
is exactly
what we want to find out.

757
01:00:19,716 --> 01:00:21,809
You know what it did
to Roscoe 1138...

758
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:24,411
and he was the most advanced
chimp we ever had!

759
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,478
Before that, there were
two other chimps...

760
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:27,421
who got
into fits of rage so severe...

761
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,981
they tore each other apart!

762
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:30,219
That's it, isn't it?

763
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:32,284
It's always like that
with you guys.

764
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:35,024
It only leads
to one thing: war.

765
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:36,531
Why didn't you include
the development...

766
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:40,002
of Jobe's other abilities
in your report, Larry?

767
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:42,129
Don't look so shocked.

768
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:43,798
You may have tried
to hide it...

769
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,674
but I have witnessed what your
new formulas, not Batch Five...

770
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,575
have done to your human subject.

771
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:53,982
I've had enough.

772
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:15,861
Make sure he goes back
to the hotel.

773
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:24,710
What other abilities?

774
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:52,501
Your behavior cost us
a lot of ground tonight.

775
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:55,993
I had to talk for hours
to repair the damage.

776
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:57,505
My behavior?
You fucking sycophant.

777
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:00,008
You've been lying
to me all along.

778
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:01,509
For security reasons.

779
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:02,602
Piss off!

780
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:05,512
Look, without The Shop's
financial involvement...

781
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:07,539
this project wouldn't exist.

782
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:09,517
Then maybe it shouldn't.

783
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:12,419
I hate to be the one
to break it to you, Larry...

784
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:15,515
but the concept
of dirty money went out...

785
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:17,890
when the Catholic Church
got into banking 300 years ago.

786
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:19,394
It's all dirty money.

787
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:22,886
For Christ's sake, don't let
some juvenile ethics problem...

788
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:24,627
get in your way.

789
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:27,192
Your research is too important.

790
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,475
You'll be more
realistic in a few days.

791
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:46,410
They're going to pick up
Jobe and bring him here.

792
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:49,185
The Director wants
a personal demonstration...

793
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:51,989
of his... progress.

794
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:55,657
They're not going to get Jobe.

795
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:57,689
There's no walking away, Larry.

796
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:02,733
All right. Let's get him.

797
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:03,796
Yes, sir.

798
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,831
Shit.

799
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:08,343
They're here to pick me up
as well. Right, Timms?

800
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:09,844
You can't leave!

801
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:12,074
You're integral to the project!

802
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:14,707
Oh, shit!

803
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:30,331
Go check the other wing.

804
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:37,639
You forgot your messages.

805
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:00,352
No, it's too much!

806
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,566
I'm Shop, Dr. Angelo.

807
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:08,195
You're going to have
to come with me.

808
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:14,139
Oh, excuse me.

809
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:33,524
Here. Here, take that.

810
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:36,190
What do I do with this?

811
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:38,223
Cover him.

812
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:49,844
Devil in your head.

813
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:51,847
Who you talking to, half-wit?

814
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:53,178
Which of God's lessons...

815
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:56,582
I told you not to play
with that moron.

816
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,086
Devil in your head.

817
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:22,669
Shit!

818
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:38,760
There's no need to panic, Timms.

819
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:40,386
We know where he's going.

820
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:43,091
We'll send a grab team
in tomorrow...

821
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:44,759
and pick them both up at once.

822
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,769
I want you to get back there.

823
01:06:47,803 --> 01:06:49,771
Cancel Angelo's clearance
at VSI.

824
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:55,038
We don't want him stealing
his work, now, do we?

825
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:57,238
I'll let you know
what the next step is...

826
01:06:57,279 --> 01:07:01,409
after we've had a chance
to examine Jobe Smith.

827
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:04,908
Give me strength, that I might
prepare the way...

828
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:05,943
for those who will follow.

829
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,885
Who's there?

830
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:11,654
Hail, Mary, full of grace...

831
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,161
Who is it?

832
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:14,662
Who's there?

833
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:17,666
The church
is closed for the night.

834
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,191
Come back tomorrow.
I'll hear your confession.

835
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:28,339
I've come for your confession.

836
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:35,044
I don't want you here
tonight, Jobe.

837
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:36,779
Leave me alone. Get out.

838
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:39,287
The good Father McKeen.

839
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:43,587
Took in the poor idiot
nobody wanted.

840
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:45,787
What have you done?

841
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:53,058
The Devil's taken you.

842
01:07:56,238 --> 01:08:01,073
Judgment Day is here!

843
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:03,135
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

844
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:05,147
They're impatient for you.

845
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:07,649
I have unclean thoughts,
but deliver me.

846
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:09,810
In hell!

847
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:12,616
I've used thy name
in profane fantasies.

848
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:15,988
I have committed
cruel acts of molestation.

849
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:18,289
Be done!

850
01:09:05,174 --> 01:09:07,438
What are you doing here?

851
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:13,608
What, you going
to do some night mowing?

852
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:18,684
You're a strange motherfucker...

853
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:21,986
and I am too tired for this,
Lawnmower Man.

854
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:24,993
So why don't you
take your silly ass...

855
01:09:25,027 --> 01:09:26,460
and go trick-or-treating
or something?

856
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:37,963
Shit!

857
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,168
Fuck!

858
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:44,744
Get away!

859
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:08,736
Don't hurt me.

860
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:10,534
Please.

861
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:35,889
Lawnmower Man's
in your head now, Jake.

862
01:10:35,931 --> 01:10:38,525
There's no escape, ever.

863
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:53,081
Stop taking his side, Carla!

864
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:54,878
You're treating him
like a little girl!

865
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:55,906
Damn!

866
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:06,718
I'm so sorry, Peter.

867
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:10,331
Why is Dad getting so bad?

868
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:14,666
I don't know, baby.
He's sick.

869
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:16,568
Damn kid's toys.

870
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:21,238
lf, in fact, that occurs,
it would mean...

871
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:24,576
he is one
of the select few...

872
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:27,173
who has been
in every Wrestlemania...

873
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:28,683
all seven of them.

874
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:30,514
Talk about talented!

875
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:54,032
How long would Bobby last
south of the border?

876
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:58,141
What's that noise?

877
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:51,698
Help me!

878
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:00,005
You are going to die!

879
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:23,531
Hold on.

880
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:26,125
All right. Come on through.

881
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:46,113
Hell of a thing.

882
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:51,626
Hello, Lieutenant.

883
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:54,629
I'm Dr. Angelo.
I live next door.

884
01:13:54,663 --> 01:13:56,130
What's happened here?

885
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:57,632
Thanks for coming over.

886
01:13:57,666 --> 01:13:58,963
You saved us a trip.

887
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:01,128
We're just taking statements
from all the neighbors...

888
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:04,139
just to see if they saw or
heard anything unusual.

889
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:05,800
There's a little boy.
His name is Peter.

890
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:07,138
Has anything happened to him?

891
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:09,644
Oh, no, he's fine.
It's just his dad...

892
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:12,647
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Where's the rest of him?

893
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:13,648
Birdbath.

894
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:14,649
Did you say the birdbath?

895
01:14:14,683 --> 01:14:15,707
Birdbath.

896
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:19,654
Lieutenant,
the wife and the kid...

897
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:22,156
they're getting ready
to go down to the station.

898
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:24,853
Said they slept
through the whole thing.

899
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:26,383
Didn't hear or see anything.

900
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:27,725
Didn't hear anything.

901
01:14:27,763 --> 01:14:30,231
The lab boys tell me
that somebody chased Parkette...

902
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:32,665
through the house
with a power lawnmower.

903
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:35,670
I would have thought that
would have made some racket.

904
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:37,171
Crazy with the heat.

905
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:38,673
Schiz-o-fucking-phrenia...

906
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:40,675
all over town last night.

907
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:42,677
What else happened last night?

908
01:14:42,711 --> 01:14:45,179
Well, somebody torched
poor old Father McKeen...

909
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:47,682
with a flame-thrower
or something.

910
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:50,184
Must have been a Satan cult
or something.

911
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:53,848
Either that or that weird human
spontaneous combustion thing.

912
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:56,357
That really happens sometimes.

913
01:14:56,391 --> 01:14:57,858
Hell of a thing.

914
01:14:57,893 --> 01:14:59,190
My God.

915
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:00,695
That's not all.

916
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:04,165
Marnie Burke was found
wandering around stark naked...

917
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:06,190
laughing her ass off,
flipped out.

918
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:08,203
The psychiatrist figured
she'd probably witnessed...

919
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:11,695
one of the murders,
and she's just in shock...

920
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:14,208
but I've seen people
flipped out before...

921
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:16,234
and this girl
is flipped out for good.

922
01:15:16,278 --> 01:15:18,212
I don't believe
she'll ever stop laughing.

923
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:20,715
Two bizarre murders
in one night.

924
01:15:20,749 --> 01:15:24,207
This world is chock-full
of nuts, Cooley.

925
01:15:24,253 --> 01:15:27,381
Don't forget that.
Weirdos, schizos, bozos.

926
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:43,728
Well, accidents happen.
That's all there is to it.

927
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:46,263
Two bizarre accidents
in one night.

928
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:47,275
Accidents?

929
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:49,777
You were just
calling them murders.

930
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:52,780
We'll just
file a routine report.

931
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:54,281
Just clean and tidy.

932
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:58,185
Oh, Peter, come here.
Come here.

933
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:01,121
It's OK, son. It's OK.

934
01:16:01,156 --> 01:16:04,125
How did this happen?

935
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:41,027
Jesus Christ.

936
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:42,553
Jobe, come on.

937
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:57,302
I gave myself a boost, Doctor.

938
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:02,083
Virtual reality
is not just a simulation.

939
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,914
It's a whole other world...

940
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:05,351
a new electric dimension.

941
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:08,756
Utopia, Doctor.

942
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:11,759
The utopia that men have dreamed
of for a thousand years...

943
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:13,920
and I'll be the conduit.

944
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:21,436
You want to create monsters.

945
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:24,701
You killed two people, Jobe.

946
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:26,674
Why?

947
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:29,677
You've got to let me help you.

948
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:30,700
Help me?

949
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,249
I'm going to help you,
Dr. Angelo.

950
01:17:35,283 --> 01:17:38,252
I'm going to help all of you...

951
01:17:38,286 --> 01:17:40,083
cleanse this diseased planet.

952
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:43,748
This technology
has peeled back a layer...

953
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:46,090
to reveal another universe.

954
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:48,756
Virtual reality will grow...

955
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:53,029
just as the telegraph
grew to the telephone.

956
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:56,735
As the radio to the TV.

957
01:17:56,772 --> 01:17:58,797
It will be everywhere.

958
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:03,137
You're having delusions, Jobe.

959
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:05,078
Struggle for reason.

960
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:07,741
I'm going back to VSI...

961
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:11,583
to complete the final stage
of my evolution.

962
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:16,319
I'm going to project myself
into the main frame computer.

963
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:18,918
I'll become pure energy.

964
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,929
Once I've entered
in the neural net...

965
01:18:21,963 --> 01:18:25,262
my birth cry
will be the sound...

966
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:28,963
of every phone on this planet
ringing in unison.

967
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:31,768
Listen to what you're saying.

968
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:36,244
The first sign of psychosis
is a Christ complex.

969
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:37,245
Cyberchrist.

970
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:40,578
Please listen to me, Jobe.

971
01:18:40,615 --> 01:18:44,073
The Project 5 abstracts
that you were exposed to...

972
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:46,917
were never meant
for the human mind.

973
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:48,923
You've had a psychotic break.

974
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:50,948
Let me try to reverse that.

975
01:18:58,166 --> 01:19:00,225
What are you blocking?

976
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:06,071
You can't hide anything
from me, Dr. Angelo.

977
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:17,941
So The Shop
is coming to pick me up...

978
01:19:17,986 --> 01:19:20,420
and you've betrayed me,
haven't you?

979
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:42,175
I'd like to proceed
to Angelo's residence, sir.

980
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:45,668
Very well. Leave the van's
cameras on transmit.

981
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:49,013
I want to monitor from here.

982
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:50,381
Yes, sir.

983
01:20:02,697 --> 01:20:04,824
Now you can witness
the impossible, Dr. Angelo.

984
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:10,060
Let me pull the curtain back
so you can watch.

985
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,302
We'll check the house.

986
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:28,922
What the hell...

987
01:21:53,975 --> 01:21:56,535
I'm going back to VSI now...

988
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:58,876
and once I'm
inside the main frame...

989
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:02,372
I'll have access to over
5,000 other databases.

990
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:03,884
And from those 5,000...

991
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:06,046
I can reach out again
and again and again...

992
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:09,887
eventually inhabiting
the entire planetary network.

993
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:11,392
By the year 2001...

994
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:13,758
there won't be a person
on this planet...

995
01:22:13,795 --> 01:22:18,255
who isn't hooked into it
and hooked into me.

996
01:22:20,335 --> 01:22:26,171
I'm sorry you hate
what you have created.

997
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:39,378
Right, Jobe.

998
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:40,911
I'll be right there.

999
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:46,817
Dr. Angelo has been working on
something else...

1000
01:22:46,861 --> 01:22:49,762
behind our backs.

1001
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:53,165
He's developed a fantastic
new energy weapon.

1002
01:22:53,201 --> 01:22:55,169
I've observed a demonstration.

1003
01:22:55,203 --> 01:22:56,727
It's very advanced.

1004
01:22:56,771 --> 01:23:00,332
I want you
to gather his research...

1005
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:03,276
all disks, hard copies,
everything.

1006
01:23:03,311 --> 01:23:06,280
Erase the files
from the main frame there...

1007
01:23:06,314 --> 01:23:09,283
then transport
it all here personally.

1008
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:11,785
I can't believe it.

1009
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:12,787
Not Angelo.

1010
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,288
Not a weapon.

1011
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:15,812
He is totally opposed...

1012
01:23:15,857 --> 01:23:17,791
Believe it, Timms.

1013
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:23,992
He took out two of my men in
a way I've never seen before.

1014
01:23:30,638 --> 01:23:34,130
I sure have
been missing you, Jobe.

1015
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,787
Peter, where are you going?

1016
01:23:54,829 --> 01:23:58,196
I want you
to come right back.

1017
01:23:58,233 --> 01:24:00,428
Jobe, wait up!

1018
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:38,302
I told him to come down here
and pick me up after work.

1019
01:24:38,339 --> 01:24:40,307
What's going on here?

1020
01:24:40,341 --> 01:24:41,865
What the fuck?

1021
01:24:45,447 --> 01:24:47,938
What did you open
the gate for?

1022
01:24:47,982 --> 01:24:48,949
We didn't.

1023
01:24:48,983 --> 01:24:50,450
Some kind of malfunction.

1024
01:24:50,485 --> 01:24:51,452
That's it.

1025
01:24:51,486 --> 01:24:54,353
The back. That's it.
Can you do it?

1026
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:59,816
Did the same guy
that killed my dad get to you?

1027
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:01,226
Yes, Peter.

1028
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:03,162
I'll explain it all later.

1029
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:07,157
Go upstairs and tell your mother
to call the police.

1030
01:25:07,202 --> 01:25:08,726
Don't worry.
Go on quickly, go.

1031
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:23,582
Erasing 261Y8K.

1032
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:25,643
Confirm erase?

1033
01:25:25,687 --> 01:25:28,417
There's a little problem
at the main gate.

1034
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:30,890
It opened by itself,
and it won't close.

1035
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:33,155
Send everything you've got
down to the main gate.

1036
01:25:33,194 --> 01:25:34,593
Right.

1037
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:35,857
Now!

1038
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:40,730
Welcome to VSI main frame.

1039
01:25:40,768 --> 01:25:43,066
Please enter pass code.

1040
01:25:45,073 --> 01:25:46,040
Analyzing.

1041
01:25:46,074 --> 01:25:47,234
Pass code cleared.

1042
01:25:47,275 --> 01:25:49,470
You have access
to the network node.

1043
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:55,673
File 15 blocked.

1044
01:25:55,717 --> 01:25:56,911
What's happening?

1045
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:59,920
Someone's hacking the main frame
from the outside.

1046
01:25:59,954 --> 01:26:01,421
They're in, and they're
running a computer virus...

1047
01:26:01,456 --> 01:26:03,822
that's placing triple key
encryption codes...

1048
01:26:03,858 --> 01:26:06,383
on all outside access
and network connections.

1049
01:26:06,427 --> 01:26:08,895
What the fuck does that mean?

1050
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:10,397
We're being cut off.

1051
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:12,899
The main frame will be
totally isolated...

1052
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:14,595
in less than two minutes.
Off the net.

1053
01:26:17,405 --> 01:26:18,372
Something's wrong.

1054
01:26:18,406 --> 01:26:20,738
I can't even get an operator.

1055
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:39,292
Explosives.

1056
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:44,353
Come on.

1057
01:27:17,131 --> 01:27:18,758
You hear something?

1058
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:19,767
What?

1059
01:27:19,801 --> 01:27:21,462
It sounds weird.

1060
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:50,897
Fuck you!

1061
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:28,662
Holy shit!

1062
01:28:33,374 --> 01:28:35,604
I have to go now, Terry.

1063
01:28:37,812 --> 01:28:39,871
Well, OK, Jobe.

1064
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:29,993
What are you doing here?

1065
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:42,138
Leave me alone.

1066
01:29:52,253 --> 01:29:54,619
I'll wait for you
down the road.

1067
01:29:54,655 --> 01:29:59,592
I want you out of here
as fast as you can.

1068
01:30:01,863 --> 01:30:05,890
But I want to go with you
to find Jobe.

1069
01:30:05,933 --> 01:30:07,400
I understand, Peter...

1070
01:30:07,435 --> 01:30:09,528
but I want you to stay
with your mother, OK?

1071
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:14,007
Peter, get in the car.

1072
01:30:16,844 --> 01:30:19,039
Larry, be careful.

1073
01:30:40,601 --> 01:30:42,228
We'll wait here, OK?

1074
01:32:20,401 --> 01:32:24,098
I'm in.

1075
01:32:24,138 --> 01:32:27,904
I'm in.

1076
01:32:51,532 --> 01:32:52,931
System overload.

1077
01:32:52,967 --> 01:32:56,164
Automatic shutdown
inoperative.

1078
01:32:56,203 --> 01:32:57,670
Oh, my God, Jobe.

1079
01:32:57,705 --> 01:33:00,196
I can't believe this.

1080
01:33:05,346 --> 01:33:07,712
Outside terminal
activity control.

1081
01:33:15,222 --> 01:33:18,191
Now to get out of here.

1082
01:33:18,225 --> 01:33:19,886
Simple combination.

1083
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:38,806
Oh, Jobe, what's happened?

1084
01:33:47,455 --> 01:33:49,855
He really did it.

1085
01:34:12,847 --> 01:34:13,836
Denied?

1086
01:34:15,883 --> 01:34:18,181
Denied!

1087
01:34:18,219 --> 01:34:19,743
I must find a way out.

1088
01:34:33,401 --> 01:34:37,064
I can't believe this!

1089
01:34:37,104 --> 01:34:40,540
I must find a way out!

1090
01:34:40,574 --> 01:34:43,338
I can't let you do it, Jobe!

1091
01:34:43,377 --> 01:34:44,366
You!

1092
01:34:44,412 --> 01:34:46,403
Yes, me.

1093
01:34:46,447 --> 01:34:49,416
You did this!

1094
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:53,682
You cut the network connections,
but I'll find a way out.

1095
01:34:53,721 --> 01:34:55,279
All this power...

1096
01:34:55,322 --> 01:34:57,381
isn't meant to be
in the hands of one person.

1097
01:34:57,425 --> 01:34:59,893
You're wrong.

1098
01:34:59,927 --> 01:35:03,021
You need to be led,
just like everyone else.

1099
01:35:03,064 --> 01:35:04,827
It's a basic need.

1100
01:35:04,865 --> 01:35:09,131
This technology is meant
to expand human communication...

1101
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:11,638
but you're
not even human anymore.

1102
01:35:11,672 --> 01:35:13,640
What you've become terrifies me.

1103
01:35:13,674 --> 01:35:15,141
You're a freak!

1104
01:35:15,176 --> 01:35:20,546
Your naive idiocy
makes me very angry!

1105
01:35:20,581 --> 01:35:23,573
Human!

1106
01:35:44,138 --> 01:35:47,198
This universe is mine.

1107
01:35:47,241 --> 01:35:50,733
I am God here.

1108
01:35:58,586 --> 01:36:01,020
I sense your thoughts.

1109
01:36:01,055 --> 01:36:04,354
What are you hiding?

1110
01:36:09,363 --> 01:36:10,728
The bombs.

1111
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:12,232
Jesus, the bombs.

1112
01:36:12,266 --> 01:36:13,324
Bombs?

1113
01:36:13,367 --> 01:36:14,834
You forced me to.

1114
01:36:14,869 --> 01:36:17,360
So you were willing to die?

1115
01:36:18,539 --> 01:36:20,666
I'll stop them.

1116
01:36:27,348 --> 01:36:30,317
You can't defuse
the bombs, can you?

1117
01:36:30,351 --> 01:36:33,252
You lost all your power
over the physical world...

1118
01:36:33,287 --> 01:36:35,118
once you
transferred in here.

1119
01:36:41,061 --> 01:36:45,657
Stop!

1120
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:52,572
So you've given me
one final game to play.

1121
01:36:52,606 --> 01:36:59,102
I find a way out, or I die
in this diseased main frame.

1122
01:36:59,146 --> 01:37:01,114
But that's not my destiny.

1123
01:37:01,148 --> 01:37:04,606
I have things to do,
people to see...

1124
01:37:04,652 --> 01:37:06,620
a billion calls to make.

1125
01:37:06,654 --> 01:37:09,589
You will die
in the explosion.

1126
01:37:09,623 --> 01:37:10,590
You're trapped.

1127
01:37:10,624 --> 01:37:13,092
You're trapped
in here, aren't you?

1128
01:37:13,127 --> 01:37:15,322
You're trapped right here.

1129
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,967
Peter is here.

1130
01:37:28,008 --> 01:37:30,806
Jobe, he's in here.
He's going to die.

1131
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:32,813
Jobe, please.

1132
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:34,314
Please, Jobe!

1133
01:37:34,348 --> 01:37:35,815
Don't sacrifice Peter.

1134
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:38,819
You and I have been
responsible...

1135
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:40,320
for so much destruction.

1136
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:41,616
What's happening?

1137
01:37:52,499 --> 01:37:55,332
I don't want more death.

1138
01:37:56,737 --> 01:37:58,967
Go. Save him.

1139
01:37:59,006 --> 01:38:00,803
Jobe, come back with me.

1140
01:38:00,841 --> 01:38:02,035
Hurry!

1141
01:38:07,081 --> 01:38:09,379
Go!

1142
01:38:37,578 --> 01:38:40,672
Access denied.

1143
01:38:40,714 --> 01:38:42,477
Help! I'm lost!

1144
01:38:42,516 --> 01:38:46,714
Somebody!

1145
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:48,016
We've got to get out of here!

1146
01:38:48,055 --> 01:38:50,615
The whole building's
going to blow up!

1147
01:38:50,658 --> 01:38:52,990
The door's locked!
It won't open!

1148
01:38:56,764 --> 01:38:58,527
Open.

1149
01:39:07,841 --> 01:39:09,365
Run, run!

1150
01:39:11,578 --> 01:39:13,307
Access denied.

1151
01:39:24,892 --> 01:39:28,623
Get down, Peter! Quick!

1152
01:39:28,662 --> 01:39:29,754
Get down!

1153
01:39:42,142 --> 01:39:45,077
There's got to be one.
Let me in!

1154
01:39:45,112 --> 01:39:47,979
Come on, Peter, quick!

1155
01:39:51,618 --> 01:39:52,846
Peter, come on.

1156
01:39:57,057 --> 01:39:58,957
Where is it?

1157
01:40:02,529 --> 01:40:03,587
Access denied.

1158
01:40:05,032 --> 01:40:06,795
Maintenance line
access granted.

1159
01:40:06,834 --> 01:40:09,496
A back door.

1160
01:40:19,513 --> 01:40:21,208
Get out of here! Go now!

1161
01:40:49,576 --> 01:40:51,976
July 10.

1162
01:40:52,012 --> 01:40:54,480
Last journal entry for a while.

1163
01:40:55,749 --> 01:40:59,378
I won't let Jobe's death
be for nothing.

1164
01:40:59,420 --> 01:41:02,389
What happened to him is
my responsibility.

1165
01:41:02,423 --> 01:41:06,052
For some reason, I've
been given a second chance...

1166
01:41:06,093 --> 01:41:08,493
so I'm taking my work
underground.

1167
01:41:08,529 --> 01:41:12,158
I can't let it fall
into the wrong hands again.

1168
01:41:13,434 --> 01:41:18,497
If we can somehow
embrace our wisdom...

1169
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:22,131
instead of ignorance...

1170
01:41:25,312 --> 01:41:28,304
this technology
will free the mind of man...

1171
01:41:29,716 --> 01:41:31,377
not enslave it.

1172
01:41:42,830 --> 01:41:43,990
We're ready.

1173
01:41:46,333 --> 01:41:48,164
Good.

1174
01:41:48,202 --> 01:41:49,692
They'll be here soon.

1175
01:41:54,675 --> 01:41:56,939
OK. Let's go.
