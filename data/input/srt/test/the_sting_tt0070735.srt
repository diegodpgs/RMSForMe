161
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,478
Harry drops four beats
in the middle of
my goddamn routine!

162
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,146
Now, how long do I have
to put up with that?

163
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,231
Leonard, you're on.

164
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,692
Crystal, you want to get
out of here tonight?

165
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,985
I come into some dough.

166
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,946
Oh, I can't.
I got a 10:00 show.
I need the $5.

167
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:15,823
I'll spend $50 on you.

Yeah.

One lady says to the other,
"Mabel, do you see
what I see?"

174
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,296
She says, "So what?
You've seen one,
you've seen them all."

175
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,589
She says, "Yes, but this one
is eating my popcorn."

Supposing there's
some Hollywood
movie agent out there.

180
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,061
All those years of training
right down the drain.

181
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,480
Hooker! Ain't seen you
in months. Thought
you took a fall.

182
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,025
Nah, just a little
hard times, is all.
Everything's jake now.

183
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,318
You gonna have a go here?

184
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,610
How about $10
on the line?

185
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,612
There's a lot of action
there on 28th Street.

186
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,239
Pay you $35.

187
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,907
$3,000 on the red, Jimmy.

No, I feel lucky. Come on.

191
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,414
Hooker, I can't accept that.
It's too big a bet.

192
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,498
There's a house limit.

193
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,583
Take it.

00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,667

Lucky for me
it came up black, Hooker.

201
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,730
A fella could get
in big trouble around here,
losing a bet like that.

Listen, Jimmy,
can't we do it again, huh?

[laughs]

Don't worry about it, pal.
It was my mistake.

There's always more
where that came from.

"Don't worry about it,"
he says. Don't worry about it.
$3,000!

00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,125
Thanks, Hooker.

They found Mottola.

He was drunk in a dive
in Joliet.

He never got on
the train.

I don't want to
hear about his day, Greer.

What happened to the money?

He lost it
to a couple of con artists
on his way out of the spot.

around like that?
You could've been nailed!

I checked the place first.
There were no dicks there.

But you're a con man,
and you blew it like a pimp!

to be no pimp.

No class grifter
would've done it, that's all.

You think my play is bad?

I think you're the best.

getting out otherwise.

are you talking about?

you could be makin'
on the big con.

You told me yourself

I never played no big con.

318
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,303
I hung around and
picked up a few things.

319
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:38,932
Ain't no rich boys
gonna trust

320
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,976
a hungry nigger
enough to be conned.

321
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,228
But I'll tell you

322
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,440
I've been looking for this
one all my life, Johnny.

323
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,234
Now I have a chance
to step out when I'm ahead.

324
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,487
Come on! What would
you do with yourself?

325
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,698
Oh, I have a brother
down in K.C.,

326
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,324
runs a freight outlet.

327
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,201
I can go halfsies with him.

328
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,831
It ain't too exciting,
but it's mostly legal.

329
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,587
I got an old friend in Chicago
named Henry Gondorff.

330
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,339
I want you to look him up.

331
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,633
There ain't a better
inside man alive.

332
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,343
He'll teach you all
you got to know.

333
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,970
To hell with that.

334
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,474
I want to work
with you, Luther.

335
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:21,975
I'm out, Johnny.

336
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,194
Yeah, sure. If that's
the way you want it.

337
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,322
That's the way I want it.

338
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,993
How do you like
that Coleman?

339
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,703
After five years.

340
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,747
Come on,
it was the only thing to do.

341
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,123
He knew he was
holding you back.

342
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,416
Yeah,
but we were partners.

343
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,044
If it weren't for Luther,
I'd still be
hustling pinball.

344
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,629
I don't need any more
than what I got.

345
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:54,049
Well, you won't have anything
if you don't lay off
the games of chance.

346
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,550
There's a depression on,
you know.

347
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:56,968
There's always
a depression on.

348
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,429
If you saved a little bit,
you wouldn't have to grift.

349
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:00,806
I like grifting.

350
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,349
Maybe you could buy
yourself some things.

351
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,184
- What?
- Clean clothes, a car.

352
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,061
I got clothes, and
I don't know how to drive.

353
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,938
[tires screeching]
What else
do you got to sell?

354
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,022
All right. Forget it.

355
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,610
(Snyder)
Hey, Hooker!
Come on, you son of a. . .

356
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,696
[pants]

357
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,281
Oh, hi there, Snyder.

358
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,324
What's the matter?

359
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,327
Things a little slow
down at the bunco department
tonight, huh?

360
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,662
Somebody lose the dominoes?

361
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,915
You scored blood money today,
Hooker, you need a friend.

362
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,292
Go find yourself
a shoplifter to roll.

363
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,549
You got the wrong guy, pal.

364
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,759
I've been home
with the flu all day.

365
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,636
You can stake out
my toilet if you want.

366
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,012
(Snyder)
Keep talking!

367
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,109
[coughs]

368
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,945
I'll tell you what
you did, smart boy.

369
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,907
You tied into a loaded mark
on 47th across from Maxie's.

370
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,034
And you and Coleman
played the switch for him

371
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,537
and blew him off
to a cab on 49th.

372
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,415
If he hadn't been a numbers
runner for Doyle Lonnegan,

373
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,625
it would've been perfect.

374
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,419
You're crazy.

375
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,716
I ain't stupid enough
to play for no rackets money.

376
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,801
Not intentionally, maybe.

377
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,304
That don't cut no ice
with Lonnegan.

378
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,763
He'll swat you
like a fly.

379
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,140
Yeah, well,

380
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,852
Well, I'll square it
with the fixer.

381
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,980
Nobody can buy you a prayer
if I put the finger on you.

382
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:36,484
Now, I figure your end of the
score was at least $3,000.

383
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,653
I want $2,000,
no matter what it was.

384
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,322
My take was only $1,000.

385
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:44,075
Then you're gonna have
to come up with another
$1,000 somewhere.

386
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,504
All right.

387
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,685
You're a smart egg,
Hooker.

388
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,689
No sense getting dead
over $2,000.

389
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,742
Relax, Erie.
I'll bill you.

390
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,003
I thought you blew
all your money.

391
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,296
I did.

392
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,174
The stuff I gave him
is counterfeit.

393
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,426
They'll spot it the first
place he tries to spend it.

394
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:46,054
Are you crazy,
giving him counterfeit money?

395
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:51,226
Hey, wait up!
Where you going?

396
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,444
I'll tell you!

397
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,289
What the hell
are you gonna do

398
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:15,083
if Snyder puts
the finger on you, huh?

399
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,543
You're committing
suicide, kid.

400
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:17,961
Christ, what difference
does it make?

401
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,005
If Snyder knows about us,
so does everybody else.

402
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,840
He never
gets anything first.

403
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:22,924
[phone ringing]

404
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,009
Hey, listen to me.

405
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,593
Don't go back
to your place tonight.

406
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,220
Don't go anyplace
you usually go.

407
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,805
You hear me?

408
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,474
Damn! There's no answer
at Luther's.

409
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,728
Look,
you better get out of town
or somethin', huh?

410
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,980
[woman shouting]

411
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,107
Hey, lady. Lady, let go!

412
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,609
Ma'am! Ma'am!

413
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,611
I want my nickel
back for that telephone!

414
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,406
[dog barking]

415
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,911
(man)
No, sir.
Nobody here did.

416

1521 North Bryant.

417
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,332
[baby crying]

418
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,920
Luther!

419
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:13,683
Is he dead?

420
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:15,393
I don't know.
There was a big fight.

421
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:16,770
I don't know.

422
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,229
Somebody must've pushed him.

423
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:22,776
Oh!

424
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,152
Jesus!

425
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,236
(Alva)
Luther!

426
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,321
Luther!

427
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,405
Jesus!

428
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,240
Oh! God! No!

429
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,825
[crying]

430
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,578
Luther! Luther!

431
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,913
What happened?

432
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,916
(Alva)
God, who would do such
a thing to you, Luther?

433
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
[siren wailing]

434
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,085
(Alva)
Luther!

435
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,586
[Alva sobbing]

436
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,629
(Johnny)
Alva.

437
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,464
Come on!
Let's get out of here.

438
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,590
Luther.

439
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,468
Hooker, come on!
If Snyder catches you here,
you're dead!

440
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,178
[Alva crying]

441
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:53,932
Get out of here!

442
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:55,016
(policeman)
Out of the way.

443
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,519
(Alva)
Help me! Help me! Help me!

444
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:59,187
[Alva continues crying]

[car honking]

446
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,358
Ah.

447
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:46,734
Excuse me.

448
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,987
I'm looking for a guy
named Henry Gondorff.

449
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,071
Know him?

450
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,156
No.

451
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:57,871
You sure?

452
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,789
Beat it.

453
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,250
Luther Coleman sent me.

454
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,296
Are you Hooker?

455
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,380
Yeah.

456
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,301
Why didn't you say so?

457
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,555
We heard about Luther
last night.

458
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,098
Come on.

459
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,851
[keys rattling]

460
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,774
I thought maybe
you were a cop
or somethin'.

461
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,652
(Billie)
It's the room in the back.

462
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:32,113
He wasn't expecting
you so soon, though.

463
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:34,782
(Johnny)
Thanks.

464
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,144
[train rumbling]

[snoring]

466
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,268
The great Henry Gondorff.

467
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:46,771
Turn it off!

468
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,193
You sober?

469
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,612
Turn it off, will you?

470
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:14,716
Glad to meet you, kid.
You're a real horse's ass.

471
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,177
Luther said I could learn
somethin' from you.

472
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,222
I already know how to drink.

473
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,559
Sorry about Luther.

474
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:28,062
He was the best street worker
I ever saw.

475
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,775
He had you down as a big-timer.

476
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,110
What happened?

477

Pretty good at it, too.

630
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,641
Where does he play?

631
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,686
The porters say he
runs a braced game
on the Century Limited

632
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,562
when he comes out
here from New York.

633
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,523
$100 minimum, straight poker.

634
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:41,193
And a lot of high rollers
ride that train
just to play him.

635
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,779
That sounds good, J.J.

636
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,282
[people chattering]

637
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,328
Which way are the rooms?

638
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,539
Who told you this guy was in here?

639
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:56,333
Nobody. I just know what
kind of woman he likes.

640
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:58,836
I'm gonna check all the
joy houses till I find him.

641
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,630
Well, maybe I could help you
if you tell me his name.

642
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,717
I doubt it.
Which way are the rooms?

643
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,094
Right through there.

644
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,096
But I wouldn't go in there
if I were you.

645
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,015
What are you gonna do,
call the cops?

646
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,850
I don't have to.

647
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:16,770
You'd be busting in
on the chief of police
just up the hall.

648
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:28,365
(Niles)
We'll play it out here.

649
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,700
And a huge duke is too simple.

650
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,703
With no fix,
we're gonna need a con
with a sure-fire blow-off.

651
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,039
I think we ought to play
this guy on the payoff.

652
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,623
It's the tightest game
we got.

653
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,167
It's not all over
the papers yet.

654
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:39,710
(Twist)
Lonnegan is a fast egg,
J.J.

655
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,795
He's not going to sit still
for a standard play.

656
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,130
(Niles)
So what does that leave us?

657
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:44,882
We can't con
the payoff to a banker.

658
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,676
We'll use the wire.

659
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,387
Haven't known a poker player yet
didn't wanna beat the ponies.

660
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:52,222
The wire's been
out of date for 10 years.

661
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:53,932
That's why he won't know it.

662
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,809
I'm not sure I know it.

663
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,520
It'll take two of us
working the inside.

664
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:01,231
Any objections
to Hooker as second man?

665
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,987
All right.
We'll give Lonnegan the hook

666
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:08,947
on the train and play him here.

667
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,075
J.J., you think I can
get in that poker game?

668
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,869
Just show up
with a lot of money
and look like a sucker.

669
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,329
I also gotta win.

670
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:19,500
Oh, by the way,
any of you guys been passing
bad money lately?

671
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:27,007
If he comes in again,
stall him so I can
get a look at him.

672
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,092
(Billie)
Mmm-hmm.

673
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,899
Fella by the name of Stenner
had this place until about
six months ago,

674
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,776
but he had to give it up.

675
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:48,445
It doesn't look so good
right now,

676
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,280
but maybe you can fix it up
a little bit.

677
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:51,949
Watch your step
when you come in.

678
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,784
There's a dip down
on the left.

679
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,134
How's it look, Eddie?

680
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:11,218
It looks all right, Kid.

681
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,095
It's big enough,
and it's off the street.

682
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,471
I don't know.

683
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:16,598
It's kind of short notice.
I'm not sure

684
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,684
we can get it all
done by Saturday.

685
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:22,563
Got to. Gondorff's
riding the mark down
from New York on the Century.

686
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:23,856
We'll take it.

687
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,233
That building at the end of
the alley, do you manage that?

688
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,317
For 15 years.

689
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,153
I'll need a corner room
facing this way.

690
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:30,445
How much a week?

691
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,697
Only rents by the month.

692
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:33,532
$250 for the two of them.

693
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,743
Last time I expect
to see you down here.

694
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,620
Never heard
of the place.

695
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:41,415
(Garfield)
It's been awhile since
I stocked the wire store.

696
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,417
Not many mobs playing that anymore.

697
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,502
(Niles)
All we'll need
is the bookie setup for now.

698
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:47,546
All right.
I'll rent you everything

699
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,840
I've got in the warehouse
for $2,000.

700
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:53,844
That'll give you phones,
cages, blackboards and ticker gear.

701
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,681
If you want a counter and bar,
that's another $1,000.

702
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,308
That's pretty steep, Benny.

703
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,018
Gondorff's still a hot item.

704
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:02,394
Where would I be if he gets hit?

705
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,021
Benny, you just give us
what you can.

706
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,522
We'll send a truck down.

707
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:08,108
Now how do you want to
work this?
Flat rate or percentage?

708
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:09,234
Who's the mark?

709
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,444
Doyle Lonnegan.

710
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:15,949
Flat rate.

711
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:24,958
[man chattering
on P.A. system]

712
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,884
The guy in the black hat
with the gimp.

713
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:45,604
He's not as tough
as he thinks.

714
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,481
Neither are we.

715
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:52,945
Mr. Shaw?

716
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,029
That's right.

717
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,239
You wanted to see me?

718
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:58,659
I hear there's
a friendly poker game
on this train. Know about it?

719
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,077
Oh, a little.Thank you, sir.

720
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,370
Can you get me in that game?

721
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:02,579
Oh, don't know.

722
00:43:02,664 --> 00:43:04,748
There's usually
a waiting list.

723
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,463
That'll get you
first alternate, sir.

724
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:18,679
I'll see what I can do.

725
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:24,393
Hey, Twist!

726
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:26,061
(Twist)
Patty, me boy!
How are you?

727
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,646
(Rad)
How are you, Twist?

728
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,606
Hey, Champ, you're
looking like a million!

729
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:31,483
Good to see you!

730
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,152
Goldie, you old son of a gun.

731
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:35,654
I saw the Kid in Denver.

732
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,197
He says to say hello to you.

733
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:39,616
Joiner, are you still
working those shapes?

734
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:41,910
Any number
you want, Twist!

735
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:43,245
Good to see you again, Twist.

736
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:44,663
Okay, Lacey.
Good to see you.

737
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,623
- It's good to see you.
- Dukey, how are you?

738
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:47,791
Come on in.

739
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,209
When did you
get back in town?

740
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,669
A couple of days ago.

741
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,963
You heard about Luther Coleman,
didn't you?

742
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,631
Yeah, some of the boys
were passing the hat

743
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:55,966
for Alva and the kids.

744
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,884
I never seen the guys
so worked up.

745
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,137
Well, don't worry
about it, Dukey.

746
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:02,848
We're gonna send a little
calling card of our own.

747
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:05,100
Gondorff is setting up a wire
store on the north side.

748
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,311
I'm gonna need a 20-man
boost right away.

749
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,104
I got plenty of talent
out there tonight.

750
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,772
You can take
your pick. Lace!

751
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,107
This is a tough one, Dukey.

752
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,318
These boys have
got to be the quill.

753
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:17,654
Get me the sheet.
Let's see who's in town, huh?

754
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:20,407
Hey, Patty,
give me the sheet.

755
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,658
(Patty)
Sure.

756
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:22,743
[door closing]

757

[chattering stops]

759
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:40,218
(Twist)
Gondorff's already on. . .

760
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,979
(Duke)
Twist, you know this guy?

761
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:57,319
(Twist)
No, I never saw him before.

762
00:44:58,196 --> 00:44:59,905
He's a dick, though.

763
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,749
Hello, Snyder.

764
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,919
- What are you doin' up here?
- I'm on vacation.

765
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,963
Hey, you seen that
friend of yours lately?

766
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:19,132
No, no.
He, uh, packed it in.

767
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:20,717
Enrolled in detective school.

768
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:22,302
[all laughing]

769
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:31,228
When you see him,

770
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:33,939
you tell him he better pay
up before I get to him.

771
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:35,023
[panting]

772

[all murmuring]

773
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:46,701
That son of a bitch.

774
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,331
Oh, thanks, Lace.

775
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,250
Now, let's see
what we got here.

776
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:56,169
Let's see. Horse Face Lee,
Slim Miller,

777
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:59,714
Suitcase Murphy
and the Big Alabama
are in from New Orleans.

778
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:03,093
Crying Jonesy
and the Boone Kid
from Denver.

779
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:06,680
Dippy Burke and
Limehouse Chappie
from New York.

780
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,433
Well, these and
the guys outside

781
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:11,435
should give you 30 or more
to choose from.

782
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:12,936
Good, Dukey.

783
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,730
Have them down at Stenner's
old pool hall before 6:00.

784
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:17,441
We're gonna run
the route tonight.

785
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:19,192
Okay, Twist, but

786
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:22,195
if this thing
blows up, remember,

787
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,030
I can't do you no good downtown.

788
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:25,407
Gondorff is federal.

789
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,701
Dukey, if this thing blows up,

790
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,787
the feds will be
the least of our problems.

791
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:35,208
[horn blowing]

792
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:46,636
[knocking on door]

793
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:47,846
Yeah?

794
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:52,642
You in?

795
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:53,810
Yeah, I think so.

796
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:55,187
I gave the conductor a C-note.

797
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:56,521
Did you find out the deck?

798
00:46:56,606 --> 00:46:59,191
He usually plays
with a Tally-Ho Fan
or a Tally-Ho Circle.

799
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:01,026
I got you one of each.

800
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:04,070
He likes to cold-deck low,
eights or nines.

801
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,532
That's nice work, J.J. Here.

802
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:22,672
[train horn blaring]

803
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:32,641
Oh, I'm sorry.

804
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:33,767
Don't mention it, ma'am.

805
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,873
[men chattering]

806
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:14,015
[train wheels clacking]

807
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:29,364
She picked him clean.
He never missed it.

808
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:33,827
My God, looks like
he's expecting a big night.

809
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,162
Must be $15,000
or $20,000 here.

810
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:39,916
He's waiting for you
in the card room.

811
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,668
Let him wait.

812
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:17,871
[cards shuffling]

813
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,964
[train whistle blowing]

814
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:30,050
You just worry
about your end, kid.

815
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:31,968
If we ever get to it.

816
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,137
[all laughing]

817
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,388
Excuse me.

818
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:38,558
You sure you
checked this guy out?

819
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:40,977
He seemed like a pleasant man,
a lot of cash on him.

820
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:42,479
$200 suit,
expensive luggage.

821
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:43,980
I'll vouch for him.

822
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:45,774
Why isn't he here then?

823
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,942
Don't worry.
He'll be here.

824
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:49,611
All right.

825
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,539
What're you doing?

826
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:06,419
Always drink gin with a mark, kid.

827
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:08,171
He can't tell if you cut it.

828
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,424
$2,000 for you, Mr. Clayton.

829
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:12,759
Thank you.

830
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,428
All right, gentlemen.
Should we not wait for him?

831
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:16,638
Let's go.

832
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:17,806
I think that's a good idea.

833
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,891
Mr. Clemens,
give me the cards.

834
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:26,940
[exhales]

835
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:30,902
Sorry I'm late, guys.
I was taking a crap.

836
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:31,986
[door closing]

837
00:50:32,113 --> 00:50:33,613
The name's Shaw.

838
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:36,825
Mr. Shaw,
meet Mr. Jameson
from Chicago.

839
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:37,909
How are you?

840
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,411
Mr. Lombard
from Philadelphia.

841
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:40,495
Yeah.

842
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:41,871
And Mr. Lonnegan
from New York.

843
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,206
Pleased to meet you.

844
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,833
Mr. Clayton, Pittsburgh.

845
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:47,043
Any of you guys want
to make a little book
in Chicago,

846
00:50:47,128 --> 00:50:49,045
I'm the guy to see.

847
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,215
The game is straight poker

848
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:54,426
$100 minimum,
table stakes.

849
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:58,221
Ah, Mr. Shaw,
this is a gentleman's game.

850
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,390
We assume you're all
good for your debts.

851
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,518
How much would you like,
Mr. Shaw?

852
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,520
I'll start with $5,000.

853
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:13,445
Mr. Shaw, we usually require
a tie at this table.

854
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:15,822
If you don't have one,
we can get you one.

855
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:18,575
Hey, that'd be real nice of you,
Mr. Lonneman.

856
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:20,577
Lonnegan.

857
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,703
[burps]

858
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:24,247
[hammering]

859
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:26,833
[man hollering]

860
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:36,926
Name's Curly Jackson.

861
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:38,595
Worked for Gad Bryan
out of Baldwin.

862
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:39,846
Jackson?

863
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,516
Jackson, Jackson.
Oh, yeah.

864
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,019
You ever played the wire,
Curly?

865
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,437
Roped for it long ago.

866
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:50,023
I can shill, mark board,
anything you want.

867
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:53,610
I don't run with riffraff,
and I only drink
on the weekend.

868
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:56,696
Me specialty's an Englishman.

869
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:58,865
All right, Curly.

870
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,575
We got a rack of suits
over there.

871
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,243
Pick yourself out
a nice tweed one.

872
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:04,871
That's all right.
I've got all my own stuff.

873
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:06,206
[laughs]

874
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:12,253
Doyle?

875
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:14,380
One.

876
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:16,216
(Jameson)
Bill?

877
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,135
I'll take one.

878
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:21,429
(Jameson)
Shaw?

879
00:52:21,514 --> 00:52:22,514
Three.

880
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,310
(Jameson)
And the dealer will take one.

881
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:34,901
Bet $500.

882
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:38,196
(Clayton)
I'll call.

883
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,950
Call and raise.

884
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:45,870
$300.
I'm out.

885
00:52:46,247 --> 00:52:47,622
(Lombard)
Fold.

886
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,044
Your $300

887
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,839
and raise

888
00:52:56,966 --> 00:52:58,091
$500.

889
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:01,427
That's $800 to me.

890
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:07,934
Call.

891
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:13,731
(Doyle)
Jacks on top.

892
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:15,567
Beats me.

893
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:20,822
(Henry)
Three tens.

894
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,660
[chuckling]

895
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:27,954
Tough luck, Lonnihan.

896
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,874
But that's what you
get for playing
with your head up your ass.

897
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:33,918
Couple more like that,
we can all go to bed early.

898
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:38,381
The name's Lonnegan.
Doyle Lonnegan.

899
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,508
You're gonna remember that,
Mr. Shaw,

900
00:53:40,593 --> 00:53:42,719
or you're gonna get yourself
another game.

901
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:44,721
You follow?

902
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:52,896
Bring it right up here!

903
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:58,151
Hey, Eddie,
we brought you a tap
into Moe Anenberg's wire.

904
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,777
You'll get race results,
odds,

905
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:02,155
scratches,
pole positions, everything.

906
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,532
And just as fast
as Western Union gets them.

907
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:06,200
Does J.J. know
how to use that thing?

908
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:08,036
All he's got to do is read.

909
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,459
The name is Joe Erie.

910
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:16,544
Joe Erie.

911
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:21,925
You, uh, played for
any particular mobs?

912
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,009
No.

913
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,178
You ever play
the wire before, Erie?

914
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:26,763
No.

915
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:31,184
I never played no
big con before, but, uh,

916
00:54:31,644 --> 00:54:34,896
Luther Coleman was
a friend of mine,
and I thought maybe

917
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,982
there'd be something
I could do.

918
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,861
You get that nose
in Duke Boudreau's tonight?

919
00:54:45,366 --> 00:54:46,449
Yeah.

920
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:52,580
You got moxie, Erie.
Get yourself a suit.

921
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:54,791
Thanks.

922
00:55:03,676 --> 00:55:04,926
I'll bet $300.

923
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,762
Call and raise $200.

924
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:10,515
[snorting]

925
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:11,724
(Lombard)
Call.

926
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:15,144
No.

927
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:16,396
I'm out.

928
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:18,356
Call.

929
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:20,900
Aces over.

930
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:23,903
Three cowboys.

931
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:26,322
All red, queen high.

932
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,158
Well, that finishes me.

933
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,785
Don't worry about it, pal.

934
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:32,578
[laughing]

935
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:35,164
They wouldn't have let you in
if you weren't a chump!

936
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:37,291
Lombard will be joining you
in a couple of minutes.

937
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:38,418
Now, look here, Shaw

938
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:39,836
I've had enough of this game

939
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,629
and quite enough of this company.

940
00:55:42,381 --> 00:55:44,007
Check me out, Clemens.

941
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,343
I guess that just
leaves the three of us.

942
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:51,222
Yes, Mr. Shaw.
that just leaves us three.

943
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:54,517
Mr. Clayton, I think we should
take a break for five minutes.

944
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:57,311
Tempers seem to be
running a little high.

945
00:55:57,396 --> 00:55:58,521
Oh, come on, Linneman,

946
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,023
I was just

Stack me a cooler, Floyd.
Oh, come on, Doyle.

951
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,288
We'll be in the station
in another hour.

952
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,415
The other guys are the losers.
You're still okay.

953
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:18,750
Fix me a deck.
Threes and nines.

954
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:20,418
I'll cut it in
on Clayton's deal.

955
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:22,003
What do you want
Clayton to get?

956
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,713
Nothing. I want him
out of there early.

957
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,923
I'm gonna bust that bastard
bookie in one play.

[train horn tooting]

959
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:33,473
$400 to you, Mr. Jameson.
You're even.

960
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:35,808
Well, just wasn't my night.

(man)
I need it.

963
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:56,329
- You know what time we get in?
- No, I don't.

964
00:56:57,873 --> 00:56:59,207
Hey, where's your ante?

Your $500. $1,000.

969
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,335
I'll fold.

970
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:47,922
I'll play.

971
00:57:49,842 --> 00:57:51,092
(Clayton)
Cards?

972
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:53,719

978
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:59,118
Mr. Clemens,

979
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:01,996
give me $10,000 more.

I'll call.

Four Jacks.

983
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:17,238
You owe me $15,000, pal.

984
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,254
Must've left
my wallet in my room.

985
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:35,131
Don't hand me
any of that crap!

986
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:37,383
When you come to a game
like this,
you bring your money!

987
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,093
How do I know you
won't take a powder?

988
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,219
No, no,
no, no, no, now. . .

989
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:41,887
All right,
I'll tell you what I'll do.

990
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:44,181
I'll send a boy around
to your room in five minutes.

991
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:45,474
You better have the money

992
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,643
or it's gonna be
all around Chicago
that you welched.

993
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:49,812
You won't be able to
get a game of jacks!

994
01:00:50,731 --> 01:00:53,024
Cash me in for
the rest of these bums.

You're on, kid.

But I can tell you,
it's a hard act to follow.

How did it go?

998
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,130
We got working money.

- Yeah?

Yeah.

Doyle, I know
I gave him four threes!

1004

He had to
make a switch!

1005
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:36,609
We can't let him
get away with that.

What was I
supposed to do?

1007

better than me
in front of the others?

Name's Kelly.
Shaw sent me.

1010
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,769
Your boss is quite
a card player, Mr. Kelly.

1011
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,062
How does he do it?

1012
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:15,189
He cheats.

1013
01:02:17,192 --> 01:02:18,859
Well, in that case,
I'll keep my money,

1014
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:20,444
and we'll just
have another game.

1015
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:22,321
You don't have any to keep.

1016
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:27,660
Here's your wallet.

1017
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,412
He hired a dame
to take it from you.

1018
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:32,498
Shaw's been planning
to beat your game for months.

1019
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:35,084
He's been waiting
for you to cheat him
so he could clip you.

Who do you think you're
talking to, errand boy?

1022
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:40,089
Nobody sets me up!

1023
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,590
Take him back to
the baggage room!

1024
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:42,675
Put one in his ear!

1025

(Floyd)
There were four witnesses
at that table!

1026
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:47,221
Then go back, get that
other goddamn son of a bitch

1027
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,390
and we'll dump them
in the first tunnel we hit.

1028

Doyle, we'll be in the station
in a few minutes!

[panting]

1033

What do you think
Shaw would do to me

1034
01:03:03,572 --> 01:03:05,197
if he knew I was
telling you this?

1035

Okay.

I want to take over
his operation,

1039
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:23,299
and I need you
to help me break him.

1040
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:32,266
Where's my money?

1041
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,350
Shaw's got it.

1042
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:36,187
How the hell could
I ask him for it back?

I was supposed to go with Shaw.

1047
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:52,661
Explain it to him somehow.

1048
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:53,954
Yeah, but he's expecting me.

1050

What makes you think
you can beat him?

1057
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:32,284
I've been planning this
for two years.

1058
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:34,537
I know his organization
backwards and forwards.

1059
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:37,248
And I need somebody
who's respectable
but not completely legit.

1060
01:04:37,332 --> 01:04:39,500
I'm a banker, Kelly.
That's legit in this state.

1061
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:42,044
All you gotta do is
put down a bet for me
at Shaw's place.

1062
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:44,004
I'll do the rest.
I'll supply the money.

1063
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:45,589
I'll supply the information.

1064
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:48,384
What about the money
you come to collect?
Won't he miss it?

1065
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:49,510
I'll tell him you paid it.

1066
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:50,803
I keep his books.
He trusts me.

1067
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:54,056
If you help me,
I'll pay you back the money
he stole out of my own pocket.

1068
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:55,724
It's worth
that much to you?

1069
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:56,850
Yeah.

1070
01:04:57,477 --> 01:05:00,271
Oh, yeah.
Maybe a couple of million.

1071
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,862
Where do you
come from, Kelly?

1072
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:13,158
From the East Side
of New York.
A place called Five Points.

1073
01:05:14,286 --> 01:05:15,619
But I got out of there.

1074
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,162
Out and up, huh?

1075
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:20,249
Hey, Floyd,

1076
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:23,252
I'm gonna have to keep
you away from this guy.

You're liable to get ideas.

1078
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:44,898
I'll be at Klein's Drug Store

How did it go?

1083
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:12,444

No.

1088
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:27,918
What about Lonnegan?

1089
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,712
I gave him the breakdown,
just like you said.

1090
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:30,796
And?

1091
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,464
He's good.
He threatened to kill me.

Hello, Doyle.

1096
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:58,824
All right, Riley,
what the hell happened?

1097
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:00,784
We missed him.

1098
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:03,120
Whoever he is,
he made a fool out of you.

1099
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:06,081
There wasn't no way
he could've known
we was in that room.

1100
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:08,083
Somebody must've
wised him up.

What does Cole
say about that?

I don't know.
He took it hard.

01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:14,840
Get out of here, Riley.

1104
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:17,968
Put Salino onto it.

1105
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:21,597
Salino?
Why waste our best people
on a small-time job?

1106
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:24,641
This is a nickel-and-dime
grifter we're after, Doyle.

1107
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:25,768
They'll get him next time.

1108
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:26,810
They had their chance.

1109
01:08:26,895 --> 01:08:28,604
All they did was
shoot up a neighborhood,

1110
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:30,355
make a lot of noise,
wake up a few cops.

1111
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,608
Yeah, but that was--
I told you to
put Salino onto it.

1112
01:08:33,401 --> 01:08:34,860
It may take
a little more time,

1113
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,445
but there won't be
any holes.

1114
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:38,697
Tell Cole I wanna see him
when he comes in.

1115
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:40,199
Well, he won't be coming in,

1116
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:42,117
not to get bounced
off a job, anyway.

1117
01:08:42,202 --> 01:08:44,495
This is Salino's job, Vince.

1118
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:47,873
Cole wants to muscle in on it,
that's his business.

1119
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,167
But he's breaking the rules
and Salino won't like it.

1120
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:51,835
Now, get me the books.

I'll get them for you.

Don't worry so much, lad.
You're gonna be all right.

1126
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,428
Just stay to the back
the first time around.

You should always
look to the back, kid.

01:10:41,863 --> 01:10:43,322
I was afraid
you wasn't gonna show.

1131
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:44,615
We haven't got much time.

1132
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:45,824
Get on with it, then.

Sometime after 2:00

1134

a guy's gonna
call on that phone there

1135
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:52,998
and give you
the name of a horse.

1136
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:56,043
All you got to do
is take this $2,000

01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:57,753
across the street
and down the alley

to Shaw's place,
and bet it on that pony.

1139
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:01,340
There's nothing to it.

1140
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:02,591
But don't take too much time.

1141
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:05,218
We've only got three
or four minutes
after you get the call.

1142
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:08,138
You'll not break him
with a $2,000 bet.

1143
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:10,223
This is just a test.
The big one comes later.

1144
01:11:10,308 --> 01:11:12,517
But be careful with that.
That's all I got.

1145
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:15,020
And you were gonna pay me back
out of your own pocket?

I am. After the race.

It's a nice con, Hickey.

1879
02:05:21,389 --> 02:05:24,016
I thought you were the feds
myself when you came in.

1880
02:05:24,100 --> 02:05:25,517
No trouble, Henry.

1881
02:05:25,602 --> 02:05:27,227
Snyder went for it
all the way.

1882
02:05:27,312 --> 02:05:29,771
You should've seen the rag
he lit under Lonnegan!

Well, kid, you beat him.

1885
02:05:39,741 --> 02:05:42,618
You're right, Henry.
It's not enough.

[laughing]
But it's close.

1887
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:53,378
Okay, guys, let's take
this place apart fast.

1888
02:05:53,463 --> 02:05:56,298
You can pick up your splits
from Eddie at Boudreau's tonight.

Nice going, J.J.

1891
02:06:06,434 --> 02:06:08,227
Oh, Henry!

1892
02:06:24,827 --> 02:06:26,828
You're not gonna stick around
for your share?

1893
02:06:28,581 --> 02:06:30,666
Nah. I'd only blow it.
