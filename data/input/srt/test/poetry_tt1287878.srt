15
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,633
- Ms. YANG Mija
- Here

16
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,634
This way

17
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,652
What's wrong?

18
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,920
My arm

19
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,921
My right arm feels prickly

20
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,598
Does it hurt here?

21
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,599
No, it doesn't hurt,
itjust feels prickly

22
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,671
Like...

23
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,307
That thing is passing through

24
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,243
What's it called?

25
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,244
It's been like this lately

26
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,481
It's... like energy

27
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,720
- Electricity?
- Right, electricity!

28
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,790
It's like electricity's
passing through

29
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,160
I'm forgetting words lately

30
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:34,064
Yesterday, I couldn't
remember,'bleach'

31
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,469
I could only remember, 'Clorox. '

32
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,806
We used to call bleach, 'Clorox'
back in the old days

33
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,577
How long have you
been like this?

34
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,578
For the past couple ofdays

35
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:52,615
No, your forgetfulness
When did it start?

36
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,886
When did it start?

37
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,887
Maybe this summer or spring?

38
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,992
How old are you, ma'am?

39
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,029
Sixty five, no, sixty six

40
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,536
Your arm's prickly because
the muscles are in knots

41
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,642
Start some light exercising

42
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:20,643
I'm more concerned that you
can't remember words

43
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,250
It could be a bad sign

44
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,387
I recommend you get an
overhaul at a big hospital

45
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,626
A big hospital?

46
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:37,627
Yes, like a big general hospital
in Seoul

47
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,332
I'll write a reference for you

48
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,871
I'm at the hospital

49
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,375
My arm feels prickly

50
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:53,376
It's continues feeling prickly

51
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,946
I kept telling myselfto see
a doctor and I finally did

52
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,518
Who else would come
with me, you idiot?

53
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,725
Your mom's okay

54
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,096
Others my age usually suffer
from neuralgia or arthritis

55
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,336
I'm okay

56
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,108
Don't cry, mom...

57
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,278
How could you be so cruel!

58
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,349
How could you...

59
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,852
You can't go way like this!

60
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,853
Where are you! Where did she go!

61
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,591
Oh god!

62
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,666
You cruel wench!

63
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,070
Where is she?
Where!

64
00:07:57,109 --> 00:08:00,109
Mom...

65
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,143
- Hello
- You're here

66
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,746
You're a little late

67
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,548
I went to the hospital

68
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,549
He called twiceI received two calls, asking
whyyou weren't coming

69
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:52,262
Dad, the maid's on her way up

70
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,920
This one, this one

71
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,921
Sit still! I told you
to sit still!

72
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,325
Stop it!

73
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:23,326
How will I undress you
ifyou resist like this?

74
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,963
Right, that's it
Pull this leg out

75
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,601
That's howyou do it

76
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:46,149
Is it hot? It's okay, isn't it?

77
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,252
Sit still!

78
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,957
Sit still, I say! Stop it!

79
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,292
- Why are you shouting?
- What?

80
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,360
What's that?

81
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:58,361
My hearing... so why...?

82
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,900
Your hearing is fine so
why I am shouting?

83
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,572
I'm sorry

84
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:10,573
I won't shout again

85
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,726
Sir, I'll be leaving

86
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,561
Goodbye

87
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,197
- Done?
- Pardon?

88
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,198
- I said, are you done?
- Yes, I'm done

89
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:40,236
- Already?
- What do you mean?

90
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,607
It's already been 3 hours

91
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,608
I did the laundry, the cleaning
and all my chores

92
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:04,127
Good

93
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,799
Thankyou, sir

94
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,001
Don't...

95
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,704
tell anyone...

96
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,705
I gave it to you

97
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,876
Okay

98
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,019
How generous!

99
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,364
Thankyou

100
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,736
Did he yell at you today?

101
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,871
Ofcourse he did

102
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,872
I doesn't matter cause
I yelled back at him

103
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,644
Here

104
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,645
- He gave me 10,000Won
- He did?

105
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:00,316
But he told me not to tell anyone

106
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,855
When it's only 10,000Won

107
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,856
My father-in-law is
notorious for being stingy

108
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,460
He must really like you. To give
you an amount like that

109
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,864
Anyway, do you always look
so chic like that?

110
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,501
Do I look chic?
I'm not chic at all

111
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,174
Where is it? Not again

112
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,343
What are you looking for?

113
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:28,344
What's that thing?
I can't remember the word

114
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,383
What you put money in

115
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:33,885
It's this big

116
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,854
A wallet?

117
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,822
That's it, a wallet!

118
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,792
Where's my wallet?

119
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,793
What's this?

120
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,799
I'm so out of it these days

121
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,907
At the hospital
I saw something...

122
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:01,344
A local middle school girl's
body was found in the river

123
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:06,082
And brought to the hospital

124
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,685
They said it was suicide
byjumping offthe bridge

125
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,957
The poor girl's mom was
totally out of her mind...

126
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,866
- I'll be on my way.
- See you the day after tomorrow

127
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:53,095
The deadline's over

128
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,171
What're you drying?

129
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:06,142
Did your daughter call?

130
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,250
LITERARY CLASS FORTHE PUBLIC
YOU CAN ALSO BE A POET!

131
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,429
Are you home, Wook?

132
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Why's the music on so loud?

133
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,704
You'll bring down the house

134
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,947
What's wrong?

135
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:45,483
Are you feeling sick?

136
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,484
Don't bother

137
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,658
I called you during the day
but you weren't answering

138
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,562
I never got your call

139
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:34,563
How can you say that
when I called twice

140
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,101
I'm not lying

141
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,102
It's cause my mobile's junk
Buy me a new one

142
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,373
I'm annoyed with my mobile

143
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,143
You just bought it, so why
do you need a new one?

144
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,144
- But I had it for 1 and 1/2 yr
- No you didn't

145
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:52,682
I got it during the 1 st semester
of my 2nd year

146
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,453
Which only shows how
carelesslyyou've used it

147
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,792
You're sprouting a moustache,
but acting like a child

148
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,800
Why'd you call anyway?

149
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,801
I heard a girl in your school
killed herself...

150
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,173
byjumping into the river

151
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,842
I wanted to askyou about it

152
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,410
Ask me what?

153
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,411
Who she was, why'd she
kill herselfthat young

154
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,553
I don't know her that well

155
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,288
What's her name?

156
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,457
Why do you need her name?

157
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,926
Aren't you in the same grade?

158
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,927
I don't know everyone
in the same grade

159
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:46,268
Grandma can't afford a new
mobile. Askyour mom for one

160
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:51,807
What? That's not fair!

161
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,407
Hey! Play with a bit
more spirit

162
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,045
This is no fun

163
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,447
Just try

164
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:32,448
The doctor told me to exercise

165
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,466
What are you doing?

166
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,373
Where are you going?

167
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,175
Gotta go see my buddies

168
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:00,176
You shouldn't go out
at this hour!

169
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,754
The electricity bill's
quite high this month

170
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,759
Wook's always on the computer...

171
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,594
playing music all the time

172
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,595
He even sleeps with the music on

173
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,867
How am I supposed to scold him?

174
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,735
Well what can I say?

175
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:27,736
He's the master ofthe house

176
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,141
What?

177
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:33,142
The Cultural Center

178
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,581
To learn poetry

179
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:39,183
What? Right

180
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:41,619
I do have a poet's vein

181
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,620
Right. I do like flowers
and say odd things

182
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,620
I'm here for the literary class

183
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,621
Literary class?
But it's all closed

184
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:22,091
I know...

185
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:25,194
But can't you accept
one more person?

186
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,499
I don't know...

187
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,500
I really want to take this class

188
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:35,137
How should we deal with this?

189
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,213
To write poetry, you must
see WELL

190
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:45,214
The most important thing
in life is seeing

191
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,021
SEE
See. It's to see

192
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,023
- We live seeing things
- Right

193
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,024
It's important to see everything
surrounding us well

194
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,027
Now, I've brought
something with me

195
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,730
What is it?

196
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:02,200
- An apple
- Yes, it's an apple

197
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,902
I went out of my way to bring it

198
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,471
I'm a well-prepared teacher

199
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,472
Others are not as well-prepared
as I am

200
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,487
Now, about this apple

201
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:26,488
How many times have you
seen an apple?

202
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,694
A thousand?

203
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,295
Ten thousand?

204
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,331
A million? Wrong

205
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,332
You've never seen
an apple before

206
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,402
Not even once

207
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,403
Up till now, you haven't
seen an apple for real

208
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,142
To really know what an apple is...

209
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:48,143
to be interested in it,
to understand it,

210
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,680
to converse with it
is really seeing it

211
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:54,683
Gazing at it for a while
and observing its shadow...

212
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,388
feeling its every curve,
turning it around,

213
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,860
taking a bite out of it,

214
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,861
imagining the sunlight
absorbed in it...

215
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,766
That is really seeing it

216
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,767
Ifyou really see something,
you can feel...

217
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,473
something naturally,

218
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,875
like water gathering in a spring

219
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,278
You should prepare
paper and a pencil,

220
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,980
and wait for the moment to come

221
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:25,383
Empty white paper...

222
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:28,384
A world of pure potential,
a world before creation...

223
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,556
This is the perfect
moment for a poet

224
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:35,557
Hold your pencil over
that pure paper...

225
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:39,163
I love pencils

226
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:42,164
When I place a well-sharpened
pencil over a piece of paper,

227
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,302
I feel full

228
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,705
My heart flutters with the hope
ofwriting a good poem

229
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,078
I love sharpening pencils

230
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,713
The very fun ofa pencil
is hand-sharpening it

231
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,281
I used to be good at
sharpening pencils

232
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,116
Pardon?

233
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:02,117
I was told to be a
good pencil-sharpener

234
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,155
I sharpened all my brothers'
and sisters' pencils

235
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:10,094
Is that so? Then, ma'am

236
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:13,095
Why don't you sharpen
my pencil some day

237
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,732
By the time this 1 month
class ends,

238
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,969
I want you all to have written
a poem, okay?

239
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:24,008
Everyone has to write one poem

240
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,776
You need to write
to really know

241
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,311
You'll never know if
you don't write

242
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:30,312
So you have to write yourself

243
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:33,482
Who has written a poem
at least once before?

244
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,688
And who hasn't?

245
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,962
Okay

246
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,963
Nowyou will be writing
your own poem...

247
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,101
for the first time in your life

248
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:53,102
- Okay?
- Okay

249
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,793
Who is it?

250
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:49,960
My friends

251
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:52,830
Why are your friends
here? It's late

252
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,064
We need to talk

253
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:57,065
About what? Haven't you seen
enough ofeach other?

254
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,505
Hello, ma'am

255
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:04,506
Good evening

256
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,730
Why's the door locked?

257
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,101
What?

258
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:34,102
Why did you lock the door?

259
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:37,239
Aren't you boys hungry?
Want some apples?

260
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,976
No, stop bothering us
It's annoying

261
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,324
Apples are better for eating
than looking at

262
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,329
What are you looking at?

263
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,330
The tree

264
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,568
Why are you looking up the tree?

265
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,970
To see it well

266
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:42,907
To feel it,

267
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,075
to understand its thoughts and...

268
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:48,076
listen to what it says to me

269
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:03,527
Hello?

270
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,696
Who?

271
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:08,165
Kibum's dad?

272
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:11,166
Yes, ofcourse I know Kibum...

273
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,270
who always hangs out
with Wook

274
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:19,474
Ofcourse

275
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,878
He was at our place last night

276
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,685
What's the matter?

277
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,686
Is something wrong?

278
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:37,092
Not now.

279
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,997
I... have to go to my poetry class

280
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:49,605
Poetry!

281
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,675
I'll be done by
12pm

282
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:58,547
The Cultural Center

283
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:00,651
Yes

284
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,652
Okay, I'll see you then

285
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,404
Writing poetry is...

286
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:23,405
all about finding beauty
Understand?

287
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,043
It is about discovering
true beauty...

288
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:28,445
in everything we see
in front of us...

289
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:31,446
in our everyday life

290
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,684
True beauty...

291
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,685
Not things just
looking beautiful

292
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,855
Every single one ofyou...
carries poetry in your heart

293
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,394
But you've imprisoned them
It's time to free your poetry

294
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:49,131
Your poetry trapped inside
should get their wings...

295
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,934
and fly away

296
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:54,905
Sir

297
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:57,541
When does a 'poetic
Inspiration' come?

298
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,977
When does a 'poetic inspiration'
come?

299
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:02,978
Yes, as much as I try,
it won't come

300
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:07,382
I'd like to know,
when does it come?

301
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:10,986
It doesn't. You must go
and beg for it

302
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:14,056
You must pray but even
this guarantees nothing

303
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,627
It's too precious
to give itselfout

304
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:19,628
That's whyyou must
go and beg for it

305
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:22,032
Where must I go?

306
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:25,033
It's not in some special place,

307
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:29,139
but somewhere you must
wander around for

308
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,608
It isn't waiting for you
with a name plate...

309
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:32,910
saying, 'poetic inspiration'

310
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,445
The clear thing is,

311
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:37,181
it is somewhere nearby,
not far away

312
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:40,182
It's there, right where
you stand

313
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:43,285
I told you poetry can be found
even in the dishwashing basin

314
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:50,025
Where are you?

315
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:53,195
The car with blinking lights?

316
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,970
- Hello
- Hello

317
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:01,472
You're Wook's grandma,
aren't you?

318
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,540
- Are you Kibum's dad?
- Yes

319
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,541
Let's get in the car

320
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,912
Where are we going?

321
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:14,051
You know our boys' group of six?

322
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:17,052
The boys' parents are getting
together for lunch

323
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,422
You can come with me
I'll take you there

324
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,945
What kind ofclass
are you taking?

325
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,946
I'm learning poetry
Twice a week

326
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,252
Poetry?

327
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:51,121
You mean singing
traditional poetry?

328
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,122
No, actually writing poetry

329
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,761
Why are you learning poetry?

330
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:59,396
I wonder myself

331
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:02,397
Why am I learning poetry?

332
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:07,402
Long ago, I must've been
in the third grade...

333
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:11,706
when we used to have
poetry contests in the fall

334
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,812
After one contest, my teacher
told me,

335
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:20,282
"Mija, you'll become
a poet one day"

336
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:24,186
Then, recently I saw the
literary class poster

337
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,690
And it reminded me of
the comment...

338
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:31,829
my teacher made 50 years ago

339
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,830
So you want to be a poet?

340
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,567
For now, my goal is
to write one poem

341
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:42,771
Our teacher told us to write
one poem until the class ends

342
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,045
When I told my daughter
about this,

343
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,714
she said I always had
a poet's vein

344
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:53,617
I always loved flowers...

345
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:56,618
and would say odd things

346
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:00,322
Your daughter's Wook's
mom, right? Where's she now?

347
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:07,062
We talk about everything on
the phone. We're good friends

348
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,601
Friends forever

349
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,204
Anyway, what's this all about?

350
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:20,244
Let's just go there first

351
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:23,245
You'll see after you hear
what they have to say

352
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:26,281
It's not good news, right?
I can feel it

353
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:29,720
Right

354
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,721
It is bad news

355
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,759
A large spicy fish stew
and steamed spicy angler fish...

356
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:39,563
- And 3 bottles of beer
- Okay

357
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,998
I don't see your boss today

358
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,467
He's away on business in Seoul

359
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,736
- So, he's not coming today?
- No

360
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,737
- We'll have the beer first
- Yes, sir

361
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,579
Soonchang's dad, why
don't you start explaining

362
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:03,018
Let's start when the beers come
We need to lift the mood...

363
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,624
Do we need alcohol now?

364
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,625
Let's start since we don't
have much time

365
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,130
Then I'll start

366
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,501
I'll give you a short recap as
some ofyou have no idea

367
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:25,874
Recently, a girl at our boys'
school, killed herself

368
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,746
Her name's PARK Heejin

369
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,747
Her folks run a farm nearby

370
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:37,485
She kept a diary stating
six male students...

371
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:42,023
raping her for months
until her death

372
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:50,365
Reading her diary, her folks
reported this to the school...

373
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,635
who called the boys in to talk

374
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,873
The six all admitted...

375
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:59,874
to the crime, so I guess
it must be true

376
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:02,512
At first, it started
with two boys,

377
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:05,215
KWON Soonchang

378
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:07,617
That's my son

379
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:10,618
- And KIM Jongchul
- Yes, that's my son

380
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:14,424
It's those two who started it

381
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:17,425
And as time passed,
all six ofthem joined in

382
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:22,132
They say they didn't
coerce her at first

383
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:25,133
- That she liked doing it
- Who would believe that?

384
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:30,705
It would only incite
more anger

385
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,511
Yes, you're right

386
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,712
Ladies first

387
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:38,713
They said, the girl was
short and plain-looking

388
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,519
So I can't understand
why they did it

389
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,821
And if she was tall and pretty?

390
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:47,822
Where in school did they do it?
And for six months?

391
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:51,161
They said they did it in
the science lab

392
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:54,162
KOO Taeyeol being leader ofthe
Science Club, had the lab keys

393
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,734
That's my son

394
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:00,504
The lab's located in
a secluded area

395
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,572
And rarely had classes or
was tended to

396
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,241
So, nobody knew

397
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,743
Although I feel sorry for...

398
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:08,678
the dead girl,

399
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,679
now's the time for us to
worry about our own boys

400
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,052
That's why I called
everyone here

401
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,053
Joint action is crucial now

402
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:21,289
Right, we should act as a group

403
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,628
Cheers, ma'am

404
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:35,238
The girl's parents...

405
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,239
- run a farm?
- Yes, but her dad died...

406
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:42,579
a fewyears ago from
a motorcycle accident

407
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,580
The mom has been raising the
girl and her brother alone

408
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,686
We need to calm the mom

409
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:52,687
Fortunately, it seems she
hasn't told anyone else

410
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,759
But we can't tell
what she's thinking

411
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:01,529
Nevertheless, in order to
console the victim's family...

412
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,834
So the point is, the
compensation money

413
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:08,238
That's right

414
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,239
Regarding the money,
we should reach an agreement

415
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:14,344
I discussed this with the school...

416
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,847
and 30 million Won would be
the proper amount

417
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:19,848
So that makes it
5 million Won per person

418
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:23,218
Who else knows about this?

419
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:26,623
The principal and a few
other teachers...

420
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,558
and one or two in the police

421
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:31,559
Our talks with the school and
the police are going well so far

422
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:34,297
The school doesn't want this
to get leaked outside

423
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:39,636
unless the victim's family
press charges

424
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,637
The problem is that a local
newspaper sniffed something...

425
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:47,744
and are calling the school,
asking questions

426
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:50,745
The local press is insidious,
so watch your mouth

427
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,550
What's she doing over there?

428
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,722
What a clueless old lady

429
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:01,723
What's she doing at
a moment like this?

430
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,527
Did you say she's
Wook's grandma?

431
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,729
Is she raising him by herself?

432
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,330
Her daughter left Wook...

433
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,331
with her mom after her divorce
and is in Busan now

434
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,237
Unlike her looks,
she's barely getting by

435
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:17,238
She lives offgovernment subsidy
and her part-time maid job

436
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:21,211
I think her daughter's
not sending her money

437
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:24,212
Then how's she gonna pay
the 5 million Won she owes?

438
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,849
She has no choice. Her
grandson's future depends on it

439
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,993
Ma'am

440
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:39,062
Are you writing a poem?

441
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:40,697
Just taking notes

442
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,999
We always have to take
notes like this

443
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
What have you written there?

444
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,537
Blood...

445
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,538
A flower as red as blood

446
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,875
They really are blood red

447
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:00,283
Do you know the floral
meaning ofcockscomb?

448
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:02,252
It's 'shield'

449
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:05,253
Actually, it looks like a shield

450
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,723
A shield that protect us

451
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,799
Let's go inside and
get something to eat

452
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,231
Awe, not curry again!

453
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,567
What's wrong?
You like curry

454
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:53,568
- I had it for lunch at school
- Really? I didn't know

455
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:21,831
Did you packyour gym suit?

456
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:23,833
It's physical education day,
right?

457
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:26,834
I packed it

458
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,675
Hello?

459
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:15,676
Yes, hello

460
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,580
What? With the vice principal?

461
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,188
Yes

462
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:27,824
What time?

463
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:30,427
Not many at school
know about this

464
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,396
The discipline instructor
here and I know

465
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:36,397
And only the dead girl's
homeroom teacher knows

466
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,968
But not the boys' homeroom
teachers

467
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:41,969
I told the girl's teacher not to
disclose this to anyone...

468
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,807
as it will destroy the boys'
future and the school

469
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:49,644
So you should watch what you say

470
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:53,014
You don't have to worry
about us, sir

471
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,185
Since the boys' future are at stake,

472
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,820
we are being careful

473
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,088
You cannot even sleep-talk

474
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:02,089
Above all, hurry and settle
with the girl's family

475
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:05,862
How did you decide
on the compensation?

476
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,863
Everything considered, we've
decided to pay 30 million Won

477
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,737
We believe that amount
will be adequate

478
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:17,738
So, have you all agreed on
the 30 million Won?

479
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,777
Yes, ofcourse

480
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:23,778
Someone can't payyet,
but everyone has agreed

481
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,250
Just hurry and settle things
with the girl's family

482
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:33,788
Okay.

483
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:57,778
Allye be awake andprayto
stand before ofthe Son ofMan

484
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:07,755
INFORMATION: REQUIEM MASS
FOR AGNES, PARK HEEJIN

485
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:20,568
And I will raise them up
on the lastday

486
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:24,073
These are the Lord's words

487
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:27,074
Praise Christour Lord

488
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:31,979
Today, we aregathered here
to offer this Requiem Mass to...

489
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,250
Agnes PARKHeejin who
left us a fewdays ago

490
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:40,254
We lament this precious life
taken at theyouthful age of 16

491
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:45,159
But we believe in God's words,
'He who believes in me...

492
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,398
will live, even though he dies'

493
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:53,701
We believe God will comfort
Agnes' soul...

494
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:57,772
and grant her the
happiness in Heaven...

495
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:00,808
she never found on earth

496
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:04,545
So we pray for Agnes...

497
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:07,050
that God will embrace...

498
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:10,051
the pain she had endured

499
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,421
So she will have eternal life
in Heaven

500
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,860
As one heart, we offer our...

501
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:20,861
most devoted prayer

502
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:24,298
All rise

503
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:27,668
For our Father who has raised
Christ from the dead,

504
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:31,572
let us pray for Agnes'
salvation

505
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:34,675
Lord, let Agnes who has received
eternal life through...

506
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:38,479
the sacrament of Baptism,
join the line of saviors

507
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:43,884
Lord, please hear our prayer...

508
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:47,888
For Agnes who has accepted
the Blessed Sacrament,

509
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:52,093
but has left us
This is our utmost appeal...

510
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,631
that you raise her again to be
back in your embrace

511
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:01,669
Lord, please hear our prayer

512
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:05,406
We also pray for her mourning
family and relatives

513
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:11,512
Please grant them peace
in their hearts

514
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:15,583
Lord, please hear our prayer

515
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:19,387
We pray in the name of
Christ our Lord

516
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:24,158
Amen

517
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:08,164
- Something wrong?
- What?

518
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:10,233
Is something wrong?

519
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:13,069
Nothing's wrong
Why do you ask?

520
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:16,070
You're very quiet

521
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:19,807
You're always chirping
away like a skylark

522
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:24,879
When was I chirping
away like a skylark?

523
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,616
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp

524
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:33,654
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp

525
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:41,831
What's with the face?

526
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,500
You look mad

527
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,669
Smile

528
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,271
I shouldn't smile

529
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:50,706
Why not?

530
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:53,707
Men used to tell me not to smile
cause it made them fall for me

531
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,915
They all went gaga over
me when I smiled

532
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:01,916
You'll do the same if I smiled

533
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,381
Come out!

534
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:15,382
Now!

535
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:22,356
Look at the mess you've
sloughed off!

536
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:25,893
Snack wrappings, socks,
tissue, the remote control!

537
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:32,234
How many times has
grandma told you?

538
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:35,235
That even animals clean up
after themselves!

539
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:43,677
Your socks, too!

540
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:04,031
Tomorrowthe discomfortindex
will be quite high due to...

541
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:06,502
the heatand humidity

542
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,503
Especially, it will rate the
highestbetween 3-4pm

543
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:13,876
Let's take a lookat the
clouds on the surface map

544
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:16,877
A fewcloud masses are
passing through the south...

545
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:19,913
and thin mistis scattered
along the central region

546
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:23,250
Tomorrow, high pressure is
moving towards the YellowSea

547
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,820
Jeju Isle and South Jeolla region...

548
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:02,356
Get up, get up!

549
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:06,996
Get up!

550
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:09,997
Grandma has something
to say to you!

551
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,474
Get up!

552
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:21,475
I said, get up!

553
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:28,915
Why did you do it?

554
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:29,712
Why are you stopping?

555
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:32,713
I don't feel like eating

556
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:36,049
What does grandma like
the most in the world?

557
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:41,223
Do you know or not?

558
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:42,892
I know

559
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:45,893
What is it?

560
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:48,464
'Food going into Wook's mouth'

561
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:51,465
Very good

562
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:08,215
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOMENT
OF MY LIFE

563
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:13,921
I was raised by my grandma

564
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:19,359
So to me, my grandma was my mom

565
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:23,964
My grandma really loved songs

566
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:27,069
But she didn't know how to sing,

567
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:30,070
because she was always
working so hard

568
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:35,909
When I was reallyyoung,

569
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:41,648
we had this large white paper,
the kind you use for rituals

570
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:47,087
I wrote lyrics on the paper

571
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:50,824
And I taught my grandma to sing...

572
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:55,796
by pointing at each verse
with a chopstick

573
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:01,802
I think this the most beautiful
moment of my life

574
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:08,809
What was the song?

575
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:11,878
'The Young Boat Woman'

576
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:16,016
My grandma passed
away last year

577
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:22,122
I remember I sang this song
for my grandma...

578
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:25,158
whenever I visited her place

579
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:29,263
Because she always asked
me to sing it for her

580
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:35,402
So, I always sang it for her

581
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:41,908
I married very late

582
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:44,911
And my first child was born
when I was almost forty

583
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:48,917
Because it was my first
delivery at a late age,

584
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:51,520
the doctors kept me on my toes...

585
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:54,521
I held it out for 10 months and
finally labor pains began

586
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,791
I never experienced such
pain before in my life

587
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:01,697
Anyway, finally amidst the
pain, my baby was born...

588
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:04,698
and I felt... something
slipping out...

589
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,471
this fiery hot mass
like the sun

590
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:16,512
The moment the baby
burst into its first cry,

591
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:19,513
was the most beautiful,
most amazing...

592
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:22,749
and emotional moment for me

593
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:27,521
I don't have any
beautiful memories

594
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,993
I'm sorry

595
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,664
For 20 years, I lived in
a basement room

596
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,170
Six years ago, I finally leased
an apartment in this town...

597
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:47,874
which had a low deposit
and monthly rent

598
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:53,246
So I moved here

599
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:57,050
I guess that was my
most beautiful moment

600
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:01,588
I spread-eagle on the floor...

601
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:04,624
feeling that I owned the world

602
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,095
THE SOUND OF BIRDS SINGING
WHAT ARE THEY SINGING?

603
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:59,468
To writepoetryis...

604
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:02,469
to remember mother's hands,
joint swollen,

605
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:07,941
washing the white rice
at cold dawn...

606
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,312
during winter solstice

607
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:11,513
Are you here alone?

608
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:14,514
Yes, I heard there's
a poetry reading

609
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:17,884
To write poetry is to wake alone
deep in the night weeping

610
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:21,488
To write poetry is to wake alone
deep in the night weeping

611
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:24,624
It is to build a
solid cornerstone...

612
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:28,597
to raise a pillar...

613
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:31,598
in your broken heart

614
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:35,635
It is to calm the bare corner
ofthe window,

615
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:40,273
shaking all night,
with all your might

616
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:45,312
It is to empty out without
hesitation...

617
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:50,984
the rancid water that
keeps rising

618
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:56,690
It is to create a forest of
emptyvoid

619
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:02,195
PEOPLE WHO LOVE POETRY
FRIDAY POETRY RECITAL

620
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:10,005
They say people who
love poetry...

621
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:13,006
are those who always
have flowers in their heart

622
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:16,910
Our Ms. CHO Mihye not only
has flowers in her heart,

623
01:00:18,147 --> 01:00:21,147
but has a pretty one
covering her heart

624
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,986
Thankyou

625
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:26,987
Next will be Mr. LEE Dongkyu
in a red T-shirt...

626
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:32,025
who will be reciting, Ms. CHO's
'A Green-colored Cicada'

627
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:42,871
I always hear the sound of...

628
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:45,872
a cicada emanating
from your back

629
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:48,875
It cries, chirr, chirr,
rubbing its eyes

630
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:54,648
As the stain of last summer's
forget-me-nots fade from...

631
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:58,918
my fingertips, the cicada keeps
crying from your back

632
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,490
I, too am crying...

633
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:04,491
rubbing my wings

634
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:11,631
This poem talks about
a green-colored cicada,

635
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:15,101
but I thought of
an ordinary cicada

636
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:18,138
In search of its mate,
the cicada...

637
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:20,976
for a short few days, cries

638
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:23,977
to its fullest as if it's
smashing summer to pieces

639
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:28,214
I wonder if I could do the same

640
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:31,584
Living as passionately
as the cicada

641
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:35,590
This thought continues to linger

642
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:38,591
Thankyou

643
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:44,397
He must have worn a red T-shirt
to show his burning passion

644
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:47,701
He must have worn a red T-shirt
to show his burning passion

645
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:52,472
Next will be Mr. PARK Sangtae
who's come after a long time

646
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:57,310
Although his leg is not well
from an accident,

647
01:01:57,313 --> 01:02:00,313
he has kindly brought us
a large watermelon

648
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:05,687
Greetings

649
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:08,190
- I was actually here before
- Oh, I see...

650
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:10,158
- You weren't here last week
- Right

651
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:12,894
So, saying 'after a long time'
would be inappropriate

652
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,429
My mistake

653
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:17,430
- Have you learned your lesson?
- Yes

654
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:24,704
'The Rose Thorn's Reason'

655
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:28,675
Don't try to steal me

656
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:32,278
The day thorns within me rise
like goosebumps all over my body

657
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:37,117
I dream of self-obliteration
with a crimson smile

658
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,720
Don't try to break me
for being beautiful

659
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:45,193
The kiss on red lips is...

660
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:48,194
the desperate passion
for virginity

661
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:52,398
Do not love me anymore

662
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:56,536
As the seasons' wheels
keep rolling on

663
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:02,778
I'm no expert,

664
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,280
but what a mighty good
picture ofthe rose

665
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:08,281
It is simply saying,
'do not eat me up'

666
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:14,856
Here is the word, 'kiss'

667
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:17,857
I thought about its
Chinese saying

668
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:23,732
A kiss means...

669
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:26,733
tongues coming and going
between two attached lips,

670
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:31,437
so it would be 'Sulwang Sulreh'.
(tongue comes, tongue goes)

671
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:39,579
A kiss means lips crashing
into each other

672
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:44,050
Then what do you call
two cars crashing together...

673
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:47,222
in a Chinese saying?

674
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:50,223
Guhwang Guhreh
(car comes, car goes)

675
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:53,259
So a car instead of
tongue, right?

676
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:56,262
You're thinking too hard

677
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:59,465
Two cars crashing together is...

678
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:02,504
It's a 'Gyotong Sagoh'

679
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:05,505
Car accident

680
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:09,375
I hurt my leg in a car accident

681
01:04:12,748 --> 01:04:15,748
I'm staying at the hospital
now, but I slipped out today

682
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:20,153
You know what I thought
when I hurt my leg?

683
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:25,358
That it would be nice
ifthis here...

684
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:28,761
my third leg popped out,

685
01:04:28,931 --> 01:04:31,931
to help me balance myself

686
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:37,706
I still have to stay at the hospital,

687
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,707
but next time, I'll be back
in great shape.

688
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:48,615
- Can I sit here?
- Yes, ofcourse

689
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:53,419
I have something to askyou

690
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:56,258
About what?

691
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:59,160
Your poems are wonderful

692
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:02,161
I still have a long way to go

693
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:05,932
You said you started poetry
recently

694
01:05:06,802 --> 01:05:09,671
How could you write
such amazing poems?

695
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:12,672
Well, in this case,
it came easily

696
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,912
As I wrote a line, words
I was never aware of...

697
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:22,815
unraveled like a thread of silk

698
01:05:23,953 --> 01:05:26,953
Like I was swimming
and floating in poems

699
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:31,524
I wrote as if I was
a flying butterfly

700
01:05:33,629 --> 01:05:36,064
Ifonly I could do the same!

701
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:39,065
I've been trying to write poetry
myself, but I couldn't

702
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:45,038
When I started to write
poetry, I also fiercely sought...

703
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:49,844
poetic inspiration

704
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:52,845
But it made things more difficult

705
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:56,549
The point is the feeling

706
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,820
Ifyou have the feeling,
you can write poetry

707
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:06,025
But I do feel things...

708
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:10,029
Then write them down honestly,
like you're taking notes

709
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:16,336
That's the most honest thing

710
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,920
Hello

711
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:37,625
It's not so stinky today

712
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:40,626
I guess you didn't shit yourself

713
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:46,134
What's this?

714
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:49,135
- Get this out for me
- What kind of pill is it?

715
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:53,942
Why are you taking this pill?

716
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:56,077
Are you sick?

717
01:06:56,078 --> 01:06:59,078
I'm not sick. It's just a nutrient

718
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:04,017
Why take a nutrient
all the sudden?

719
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,820
Why are you being such a nag?

720
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:11,758
Just get it out for me

721
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:58,266
Please

722
01:08:58,267 --> 01:09:01,267
Let go! Stop it!

723
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:04,739
Before I die,

724
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:07,740
I wanna do itjust for once

725
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:14,113
I don't need anything else

726
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:17,416
Just for once...

727
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,221
I wanna be a man

728
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:22,657
It's my wish

729
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,926
Let go of me!

730
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:27,927
Who do you think I am?

731
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:32,632
What was that pill you took?

732
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:42,076
What kind of pill is this?

733
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:45,077
It's that thing you call
Viagra, right?

734
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:56,558
You go dry and dress yourself!

735
01:09:56,559 --> 01:09:59,559
No one else will from now on!

736
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:31,226
Ms. YANG Mija!

737
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:32,694
Here!

738
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:34,662
Go to Room 1, please

739
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:37,663
Okay

740
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:47,041
Hello

741
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:50,042
Please have a seat

742
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:03,990
Oh, those are camellias!

743
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:08,027
I just love camellias

744
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:11,097
Flowers ofwinter,
flowers of pain...

745
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:14,235
Are camellias flowers of pain?

746
01:11:14,236 --> 01:11:17,236
Yes, red flowers represent pain

747
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,274
White is virginity, yellow is glory

748
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:26,281
I've been studying lately
to write poetry

749
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,783
Poetry? Are you a poet?

750
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:31,784
No, I'm just trying to
write a poem

751
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:34,689
Did you come alone?

752
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:37,191
Nobody's with you?

753
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:39,227
I came by myself.
Why do you ask?

754
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:42,228
I'd prefer talking to
someone else

755
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:45,498
Why? Is there something wrong?

756
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:49,537
The test results say...

757
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:52,538
you've got Alzheimer's

758
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:55,510
Often called, 'dementia'

759
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:58,511
No, I'm fine

760
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:00,748
You're fine for now

761
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:03,217
Since it's at a very early stage

762
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:06,218
But the disease has already
progressed

763
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:09,622
You're occasionally
forgetting words for now,

764
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:14,226
but graduallyyour
memory loss will worsen

765
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:19,165
At first, you won't
recall nouns...

766
01:12:20,135 --> 01:12:23,071
and then verbs

767
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:24,772
You knowverbs, right?

768
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:27,773
Ofcourse I knowverbs

769
01:12:28,644 --> 01:12:31,379
But nouns are the most important

770
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:34,380
Right, nouns are most important

771
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:44,757
Those are fake

772
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:52,700
I'm at the hospital

773
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:55,701
To get my test results

774
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:57,839
Huh? What?

775
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,607
The doctor says I'm okay

776
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:01,209
She told me to exercise

777
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,144
Exercise more

778
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:06,145
The doctor also told me
to write poetry a lot

779
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:14,653
Okay

780
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,128
Could you go to that place...

781
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:22,463
Ah...

782
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:25,464
Dongseoul, what was it?
It was a Dongseoul something...

783
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:30,035
Where there are a lot of
cross-country buses

784
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:35,910
- The bus terminal?
- Right, the bus terminal

785
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:38,911
I get like this

786
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:20,853
Wetlipstickon the wineglass

787
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:25,891
Wetlipstickon the wineglass

788
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:31,130
With myyearning foryou

789
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:34,302
- Which room is she in?
- Room No. 5

790
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,237
Room No. 5?

791
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:39,238
I've been grabbing onto
the rope Ihad to release,

792
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:44,410
butnow's the time to letgo

793
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:51,684
You mayhave forgotten...

794
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:58,257
myname bynow

795
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:05,231
But Icrudelyraise...

796
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:11,770
a wineglass again because ofyou

797
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:19,078
NowI wanna take off
mydress ofattachment...

798
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:25,651
and drinka glass ofoblivion

799
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:33,127
Ma'am!

800
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:35,196
You're really good!

801
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:37,398
Oh my, don't embarrass me

802
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:40,399
I got bored waiting for you,
so I was killing time

803
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:44,703
You must have broken many
hearts back in the days

804
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:47,740
You've got great appeal

805
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:50,444
In fact,

806
01:15:50,445 --> 01:15:52,713
I have too many stories to tell
about my past

807
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:55,714
Anyway, what brings you here?

808
01:15:57,286 --> 01:16:00,286
It's just that...

809
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:03,455
Regarding the 5 million
I have to pay

810
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:08,093
Can you lend me the money?

811
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:11,730
I've got no one else to ask

812
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:15,834
Oh my...

813
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:18,139
Ma'am

814
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:21,140
Don't do this

815
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:23,444
I know

816
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:25,713
I do, but...

817
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:28,714
there's no way
I can get the money

818
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:31,884
So I'm asking you

819
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:35,656
I will payyou back

820
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:38,657
I'll even work here

821
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:42,595
I'll do anything

822
01:16:43,398 --> 01:16:45,866
I'm sorry, but...

823
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:48,867
I don't have the money
to lend you

824
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:52,404
And there's nojob for
you at a karaoke

825
01:16:52,674 --> 01:16:55,674
Then what shall I do?

826
01:16:55,811 --> 01:16:58,112
I'll have to rob a bank, then

827
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:00,181
Talk to Wook's mom

828
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:02,016
Why won't you tell her?

829
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:04,518
You said you talked about
everything with her...

830
01:17:04,519 --> 01:17:07,519
and that you were
friends forever

831
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,991
I go to a Catholic church

832
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:15,661
And our church is quite
old and beautiful

833
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:20,067
In the front yard at springtime,

834
01:17:20,068 --> 01:17:22,303
buds...

835
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:24,972
that spring from the branches...

836
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:27,742
are a grass green color...

837
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:30,011
which looks so sad

838
01:17:30,012 --> 01:17:32,580
It's so pretty that it looks sad

839
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:35,581
So I would brush my hand
over the buds...

840
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:41,487
saying, "how prettyyou are"

841
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:46,125
They say it's a sign that
I'm getting older

842
01:17:47,696 --> 01:17:50,696
I might get sick or
be in agony, but...

843
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,000
I'm happy

844
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:56,001
I am happy

845
01:17:56,038 --> 01:17:59,038
Now I am in love

846
01:18:00,575 --> 01:18:03,575
But it's so beautiful...

847
01:18:04,112 --> 01:18:06,714
and painful

848
01:18:06,715 --> 01:18:09,715
It's painful because it's love
that cannot be

849
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:16,622
He's married like me

850
01:18:18,994 --> 01:18:21,994
I always thought I despised him

851
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:27,466
He really has a bad temper

852
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:30,903
But one day, we were
leaving from a night shift...

853
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:36,108
and ended up sleeping together

854
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:41,613
Itjust happened once, but...

855
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:45,050
I couldn't erase that memory

856
01:18:49,357 --> 01:18:52,357
The more I tried, the more
it reminded me of him

857
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:57,629
Ifonly he hadn't been
in my sight

858
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:01,500
They say, 'out of sight,
out of mind'

859
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:05,537
But he wasn't intended
to be out of my sight

860
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:11,110
I cried and laughed like crazy

861
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:18,250
But the suffering is
driving me to death

862
01:19:23,725 --> 01:19:26,725
But even the suffering
is beautiful

863
01:19:30,465 --> 01:19:33,465
I recall a moment when
I was veryyoung

864
01:19:35,337 --> 01:19:38,337
It might be the very
first memory of mine

865
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:46,078
I was too young to
remember how old I was

866
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:51,085
Three?

867
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:53,120
Maybe four?

868
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:55,589
I guess mom was sick

869
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:58,590
So my older sister
was taking care of me

870
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:03,295
We're seven years apart

871
01:20:07,502 --> 01:20:10,502
In the living room,

872
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:14,239
the red curtains are
drawn closed

873
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,812
But through a slight opening,

874
01:20:20,382 --> 01:20:23,382
the sunlight is seeping in

875
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:29,388
Now I can see half
of my sister's face

876
01:20:31,626 --> 01:20:34,626
The other half is hidden
in the shadows

877
01:20:35,163 --> 01:20:38,163
I think she dressed
me in pretty clothes

878
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:44,670
"Mija, come here. Come here"

879
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:48,740
She is saying, clapping
her hands

880
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:51,743
I am tottering to her

881
01:20:51,947 --> 01:20:54,947
Although I was so little,
I knew my sister loved me...

882
01:20:56,952 --> 01:20:59,253
as she told me to come to her

883
01:20:59,254 --> 01:21:02,254
I felt so good

884
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:06,491
And so happy

885
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:09,263
'I am really pretty'...

886
01:21:09,264 --> 01:21:12,264
was how I felt

887
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:15,803
"Mija, come here"

888
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:18,804
"Hurry over here, Mija"

889
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:25,917
Thankyou

890
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:32,557
What brings you here?
You're all wet from the rain

891
01:25:33,828 --> 01:25:35,996
Give me the keys
to the 3rd floor

892
01:25:35,997 --> 01:25:38,665
Are you coming back to work?

893
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:40,934
What changed your mind?

894
01:25:40,935 --> 01:25:43,935
I thought you'd never come back

895
01:26:26,247 --> 01:26:29,247
What are you looking for?

896
01:26:51,573 --> 01:26:54,573
Take this

897
01:26:56,911 --> 01:26:59,911
Now

898
01:30:11,839 --> 01:30:14,574
Ah, here she comes

899
01:30:14,575 --> 01:30:17,575
- Thankyou
- You're welcome

900
01:30:19,147 --> 01:30:22,147
Well hello, ma'am!

901
01:30:22,717 --> 01:30:24,184
Yes, hello

902
01:30:24,185 --> 01:30:26,853
You're Wook's grandma, right?

903
01:30:26,854 --> 01:30:29,854
Yes. And who are you?

904
01:30:30,024 --> 01:30:33,024
I write for the 'Kyungkang Times'

905
01:30:34,128 --> 01:30:36,596
It must be hard for you
these days, right?

906
01:30:36,597 --> 01:30:38,965
Well, it's okay

907
01:30:38,966 --> 01:30:40,801
Let's see

908
01:30:40,802 --> 01:30:43,802
Why don't we sit over here

909
01:30:47,575 --> 01:30:50,575
You look amazing, ma'am

910
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:55,680
How nice ofyou

911
01:30:55,783 --> 01:30:58,783
How are the settlements going?

912
01:31:00,721 --> 01:31:02,856
Not that great, I guess

913
01:31:02,857 --> 01:31:04,357
How come?

914
01:31:04,358 --> 01:31:07,358
Is the victim's side refusing
your amount?

915
01:31:08,229 --> 01:31:11,229
I don't know for sure, but...

916
01:31:12,233 --> 01:31:15,233
the girl's mom doesn't
want to settle, I guess

917
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:19,103
I see, the girl's mom...

918
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:22,307
With a case like that, it's
usually money problems

919
01:31:25,446 --> 01:31:28,446
But are there reasons
other than money?

920
01:31:28,883 --> 01:31:31,883
- I don't know, but...
- Yes?

921
01:31:35,389 --> 01:31:36,523
What's wrong?

922
01:31:36,524 --> 01:31:37,657
No, I can't...

923
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:38,992
You can't, what?

924
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:40,160
What's the matter?

925
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:41,761
Please sit for a moment, ma'am

926
01:31:41,762 --> 01:31:42,796
No!

927
01:31:42,797 --> 01:31:45,797
I just have a few more
questions. Wait!

928
01:32:01,983 --> 01:32:04,983
'We're trying to settle
with the girl's mom,

929
01:32:06,854 --> 01:32:09,854
but she's refusing'
Is that what you said?

930
01:32:10,825 --> 01:32:13,825
I don't fucking believe this

931
01:32:13,861 --> 01:32:16,861
Didn't we tell you to
watch your mouth?

932
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:20,031
That guy from finally got his tip...

933
01:32:20,768 --> 01:32:23,768
after sniffing out the school and
police station almost every day

934
01:32:24,071 --> 01:32:27,071
She didn't say anything
specific yet

935
01:32:27,975 --> 01:32:30,410
But it's never late to move now

936
01:32:30,411 --> 01:32:33,411
Ifonly the girl's mom keeps
quiet, we'll be okay

937
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:37,382
There's not much time

938
01:32:37,785 --> 01:32:39,586
Come later, okay?

939
01:32:39,587 --> 01:32:42,587
I'm in an important meeting

940
01:32:47,495 --> 01:32:50,495
How about meeting
the girl's mom yourself?

941
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:54,232
- Who me?
- Yes

942
01:32:54,702 --> 01:32:57,702
You go meet and persuade
the girl's mom

943
01:32:58,973 --> 01:33:01,973
What could I say to her?

944
01:33:03,644 --> 01:33:06,046
I can't do it

945
01:33:06,047 --> 01:33:08,815
Just plead with her
heart-to-heart

946
01:33:08,816 --> 01:33:10,817
Woman-to-woman

947
01:33:10,818 --> 01:33:13,818
You can be better than us

948
01:33:14,956 --> 01:33:17,290
Right, sounds like a plan

949
01:33:17,291 --> 01:33:20,291
A poor old lady, raising
her grandson alone pleads...

950
01:33:21,729 --> 01:33:23,229
woman-to-woman

951
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:25,498
Shedding a little tears

952
01:33:25,499 --> 01:33:26,900
Yes, let's do that

953
01:33:26,901 --> 01:33:29,169
Ma'am

954
01:33:29,170 --> 01:33:32,170
Meet her immediately
I'll drive you there, tomorrow

955
01:33:55,696 --> 01:33:57,697
Call me when you're done
I'll come to pickyou up

956
01:33:57,698 --> 01:34:00,698
I'll take the bus. There
I see a bus stop

957
01:34:04,839 --> 01:34:06,673
I can get home by myself

958
01:34:06,674 --> 01:34:09,509
Anyway, call me ifyou need a
ride. Do a good job

959
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:12,510
Everything depends on you now
You do understand?

960
01:34:13,748 --> 01:34:16,748
Yes

961
01:34:29,697 --> 01:34:31,564
Your outfit stands out too much

962
01:34:31,565 --> 01:34:34,501
It really doesn't fit in with
the neighborhood

963
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:37,502
Then what should I do?
Should I go back?

964
01:34:37,638 --> 01:34:40,073
I can come again in
different clothes

965
01:34:40,074 --> 01:34:42,475
You can'tjust leave now

966
01:34:42,476 --> 01:34:44,344
Your words hold the key

967
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:47,013
Don't say anything
to upset her, okay?

968
01:34:47,014 --> 01:34:49,249
You grasp the situation, right?

969
01:34:49,250 --> 01:34:52,250
I'll try

970
01:35:11,605 --> 01:35:14,605
Excuse me

971
01:35:17,545 --> 01:35:20,545
Is anyone there?

972
01:35:51,846 --> 01:35:54,846
Where did everyone go?

973
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:42,560
Are you here for someone?

974
01:36:43,964 --> 01:36:46,964
I guess everyone's out?

975
01:36:48,869 --> 01:36:51,869
The gate was open so I invited
myself in, but no one's here

976
01:36:52,673 --> 01:36:55,673
The mom's out in the fields
What brings you here?

977
01:36:57,578 --> 01:37:00,578
I have to talk to her

978
01:37:02,249 --> 01:37:04,551
She'll be back around sunset

979
01:37:04,552 --> 01:37:07,552
Why don't you go to
the fields to find her

980
01:37:07,855 --> 01:37:09,956
Where's that?

981
01:37:09,957 --> 01:37:12,759
Over there you'll find
a plastic greenhouse

982
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:15,760
Go past it and there's a field
near a brook. She'll be there

983
01:37:40,421 --> 01:37:43,421
How fussyyou are

984
01:38:29,069 --> 01:38:34,939
IT IS CRUSHED AND TRAMPLED
FOR ITS NExT LIFE

985
01:38:54,395 --> 01:38:57,163
Hello

986
01:38:57,164 --> 01:38:59,933
Yes, hello

987
01:38:59,934 --> 01:39:01,935
Isn't the weather nice?

988
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:04,936
Yes, the weather's being helpful

989
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:08,773
This place is quite nice
The scenery is so beautiful

990
01:39:11,345 --> 01:39:14,147
It makes me want to live here

991
01:39:14,148 --> 01:39:17,148
It's not an easy place
to live though

992
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:21,619
I found an apricot
on my way here

993
01:39:21,722 --> 01:39:24,722
Many have fallen to the ground

994
01:39:25,392 --> 01:39:28,392
I took a bite and
it tasted quite good

995
01:39:29,930 --> 01:39:32,498
Fallen apricots have
a better taste

996
01:39:32,499 --> 01:39:34,500
The one still on trees
are too puckery to eat

997
01:39:34,501 --> 01:39:37,103
Yes, you're right

998
01:39:37,104 --> 01:39:38,838
It tasted good

999
01:39:38,839 --> 01:39:41,474
When I saw the apricots
on the ground,

1000
01:39:41,475 --> 01:39:44,210
I thought they were
full ofyearning

1001
01:39:44,211 --> 01:39:46,279
Throwing themselves
to the ground...

1002
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:48,715
be crushed and trampled on,

1003
01:39:48,716 --> 01:39:51,716
they prepare for their next life

1004
01:39:52,152 --> 01:39:55,152
For the first time, I realized
this about apricots

1005
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:02,360
There were also garden zinnias
growing near the apricot trees

1006
01:40:02,429 --> 01:40:05,429
And how pretty they
fall to the ground

1007
01:40:05,766 --> 01:40:08,766
I felt so blessed to
walk in such beauty

1008
01:40:12,206 --> 01:40:15,206
I love flowers so much, I get
happyjust to see them

1009
01:40:17,811 --> 01:40:20,811
Gazing at flowers
makes me feel full...

1010
01:40:22,216 --> 01:40:24,784
that I don't even need to eat

1011
01:40:24,785 --> 01:40:27,785
You must like flowers
cause you're pretty

1012
01:40:27,888 --> 01:40:29,956
You think I'm pretty?

1013
01:40:29,957 --> 01:40:32,957
Why thankyou

1014
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:36,460
I do like to dress up a bit

1015
01:40:37,865 --> 01:40:40,633
How's the crop coming along
this year?

1016
01:40:40,634 --> 01:40:43,634
It's so so

1017
01:40:43,704 --> 01:40:46,704
I hope it's a good harvest,
so you'll earn a lot

1018
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:50,610
Prices will drop on a good year,

1019
01:40:50,611 --> 01:40:52,812
while it's as tough on a bad year

1020
01:40:52,813 --> 01:40:54,380
Nothing's easy, you know?

1021
01:40:54,381 --> 01:40:56,616
Yes, but...

1022
01:40:56,617 --> 01:40:59,617
I hope everything goes well

1023
01:41:00,754 --> 01:41:02,722
Then...

1024
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:04,457
have a good day

1025
01:41:04,458 --> 01:41:07,458
- Yes, goodbye
- Bye

1026
01:42:10,257 --> 01:42:11,691
Well...

1027
01:42:11,692 --> 01:42:13,392
I...

1028
01:42:13,393 --> 01:42:15,695
couldn't meet her

1029
01:42:15,696 --> 01:42:18,664
No one was home

1030
01:42:18,665 --> 01:42:21,665
So I left after waiting
for a while

1031
01:42:21,902 --> 01:42:24,437
I'm sorry

1032
01:42:24,438 --> 01:42:25,805
Excuse me?

1033
01:42:25,806 --> 01:42:27,573
I'm sorry because...

1034
01:42:31,411 --> 01:42:34,411
Die...

1035
01:42:34,548 --> 01:42:36,215
Die...

1036
01:42:36,216 --> 01:42:38,417
as you love

1037
01:42:38,418 --> 01:42:41,387
To the point that the Vairocana
Buddha...

1038
01:42:41,388 --> 01:42:43,189
hangs suspended...

1039
01:42:43,190 --> 01:42:46,159
by a finger

1040
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:49,160
Die as you wait

1041
01:42:49,696 --> 01:42:52,696
To the point that
the Amitabha Buddha...

1042
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,801
severs its head
to use as a pillow

1043
01:42:55,802 --> 01:42:57,637
Until dawn passes...

1044
01:42:57,638 --> 01:43:00,506
the iron bell for
offerings to Buddha...

1045
01:43:00,507 --> 01:43:02,341
does not ring

1046
01:43:02,342 --> 01:43:05,342
I sit by the columns of
BuseokTemple...

1047
01:43:05,712 --> 01:43:07,747
throughout my life

1048
01:43:07,748 --> 01:43:10,748
Unable to offer you even
one bowl of rice

1049
01:43:12,386 --> 01:43:15,386
But within a tear, I build a
temple and then tear it down

1050
01:43:17,257 --> 01:43:20,257
Above a rock hanging in the sky,
I build a temple

1051
01:43:26,567 --> 01:43:28,401
'Die as you Love'

1052
01:43:28,402 --> 01:43:31,402
Yes, I'd like to die as I love

1053
01:43:32,539 --> 01:43:34,674
It's a poem that
hits you strong...

1054
01:43:34,675 --> 01:43:37,043
like when you take
a cold shower

1055
01:43:37,044 --> 01:43:38,177
Next is...

1056
01:43:38,178 --> 01:43:41,178
Mr. PARK Sangtae who will
read AHN Dohyun's poem

1057
01:43:45,085 --> 01:43:48,085
I askyou

1058
01:43:48,322 --> 01:43:51,322
This is the title ofthe poem

1059
01:43:53,026 --> 01:43:56,026
Do not even dare kick at
the ashes of burnt coal

1060
01:43:59,833 --> 01:44:02,802
Have you ever been...

1061
01:44:02,803 --> 01:44:05,803
a burning person to another?

1062
01:44:07,274 --> 01:44:09,742
That's the end

1063
01:44:09,743 --> 01:44:12,211
It's a good poem
cause it's short

1064
01:44:12,212 --> 01:44:15,212
The emcee mentioned shower

1065
01:44:15,449 --> 01:44:18,449
The recent heat wave makes you
shower everyday, right?

1066
01:44:19,052 --> 01:44:22,052
Well I did some research
on showers

1067
01:44:25,058 --> 01:44:29,061
No

1068
01:44:29,062 --> 01:44:30,563
You don't?

1069
01:44:30,564 --> 01:44:32,898
The five stages are...

1070
01:44:32,899 --> 01:44:34,267
Stage 1

1071
01:44:34,268 --> 01:44:37,103
Take shower!

1072
01:44:37,104 --> 01:44:39,405
Stage 2

1073
01:44:39,406 --> 01:44:42,008
Spread-eagle!

1074
01:44:42,009 --> 01:44:43,843
Stage 3

1075
01:44:43,844 --> 01:44:46,579
Get boner!

1076
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:48,581
Next is...

1077
01:44:48,582 --> 01:44:51,582
Plug into!

1078
01:44:52,085 --> 01:44:54,287
And last but not least...

1079
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:57,288
Oh, thank, yer!

1080
01:44:58,225 --> 01:45:00,293
Thankyou very much

1081
01:45:00,294 --> 01:45:03,294
Good health requires occasional
physical stimulation

1082
01:45:05,766 --> 01:45:08,766
I'm out ofthe hospital
and back at work

1083
01:45:09,569 --> 01:45:12,305
Ifyou everyvisit
the police station,

1084
01:45:12,306 --> 01:45:15,306
please stop by to see me

1085
01:45:19,746 --> 01:45:22,746
So he works at
the police station?

1086
01:45:23,784 --> 01:45:26,784
Yes he does
Pretty funny, isn't he?

1087
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:29,920
We're here to love poetry

1088
01:45:30,023 --> 01:45:33,023
To love poetry is to seek
beauty, right?

1089
01:45:33,694 --> 01:45:36,694
But he's always
talking dirty like that

1090
01:45:37,331 --> 01:45:40,331
It's like he's insulting poetry

1091
01:45:41,468 --> 01:45:44,468
He actually has a good heart

1092
01:45:44,471 --> 01:45:46,806
He used to work at the Seoul
Police Station,

1093
01:45:46,807 --> 01:45:49,807
but after reporting
internal corruption,

1094
01:45:50,077 --> 01:45:52,378
he was demoted to this
country police station

1095
01:45:52,379 --> 01:45:54,380
Really?

1096
01:45:54,381 --> 01:45:57,381
It doesn't look like that

1097
01:46:20,807 --> 01:46:23,242
Mr. PARK!

1098
01:46:23,243 --> 01:46:26,243
- Mr. PARK!
- Yes, yes, yes

1099
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:29,115
- This lady...
- Yes?

1100
01:46:29,116 --> 01:46:32,116
She says you're insulting poetry

1101
01:46:33,286 --> 01:46:36,286
How come our chic
big sister thinks that?

1102
01:46:39,226 --> 01:46:42,226
To recite poetry is
to love it, right?

1103
01:46:42,963 --> 01:46:44,430
So?

1104
01:46:44,431 --> 01:46:47,166
To love poetry is...

1105
01:46:47,167 --> 01:46:49,769
seeking true beauty

1106
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:52,770
True beauty... That's
a tough one for me

1107
01:46:54,274 --> 01:46:55,875
I'm not that intelligent,
you know

1108
01:46:55,876 --> 01:46:57,309
Anyway, go on

1109
01:46:57,310 --> 01:46:59,812
At a place you're supposed
to seek beauty,

1110
01:46:59,813 --> 01:47:02,114
she says you're always...

1111
01:47:02,115 --> 01:47:05,115
talking dirty

1112
01:47:06,019 --> 01:47:08,821
Sorry, big sister!

1113
01:47:08,822 --> 01:47:11,822
I apologize for insulting poetry

1114
01:47:12,626 --> 01:47:14,026
I promise to repent

1115
01:47:14,027 --> 01:47:17,027
And to showyou I will,
let me pour you a glass

1116
01:47:18,298 --> 01:47:20,065
I can't drink

1117
01:47:20,066 --> 01:47:21,467
Just one glass

1118
01:47:21,468 --> 01:47:24,468
They sayyou should drink or
fall in love to write poetry

1119
01:47:31,144 --> 01:47:33,512
Attention everyone!

1120
01:47:33,513 --> 01:47:35,014
You all know...

1121
01:47:35,015 --> 01:47:36,649
the poet, KIM Yongtak, right?

1122
01:47:36,650 --> 01:47:38,150
- Yes
- Good evening

1123
01:47:38,151 --> 01:47:41,151
I saw him drinking in the other
room and dragged him over

1124
01:47:45,325 --> 01:47:47,259
Greetings!

1125
01:47:47,260 --> 01:47:50,062
Actually I wasn't dragged here

1126
01:47:50,063 --> 01:47:53,063
I heard our 'Love Poetry'
members were here,

1127
01:47:53,133 --> 01:47:55,568
so I volunteered to
drop by and say hello

1128
01:47:55,569 --> 01:47:58,569
I was here with myyoung
poet friends for a drink

1129
01:47:59,306 --> 01:48:01,407
This man next to me...

1130
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:04,408
is the poet, HWANG Myungseung

1131
01:48:09,549 --> 01:48:12,084
- Pleasejoin us for a drink
- Okay

1132
01:48:12,085 --> 01:48:13,853
- Join us as well
- Okay

1133
01:48:13,854 --> 01:48:16,555
Good evening, sir

1134
01:48:16,556 --> 01:48:19,556
Uh? Are you also
a member ofthis group?

1135
01:48:19,693 --> 01:48:22,127
No, I'm not

1136
01:48:22,128 --> 01:48:25,128
But I came to the reading
and ended up here

1137
01:48:25,732 --> 01:48:28,732
Anyway, in an era when
poetry is dying away,

1138
01:48:29,135 --> 01:48:32,135
I am so thankful and happy
that there are people like you...

1139
01:48:32,439 --> 01:48:34,840
who love poetry

1140
01:48:34,841 --> 01:48:36,876
- Sir
- Yes?

1141
01:48:36,877 --> 01:48:39,245
Why are you saying
poetry is dying away?

1142
01:48:39,246 --> 01:48:41,814
But it is. Unfortunately,

1143
01:48:41,815 --> 01:48:44,815
the day will come when
people no longer read...

1144
01:48:46,152 --> 01:48:47,720
or write poetry anymore

1145
01:48:47,721 --> 01:48:50,589
Poetry deserves to die!

1146
01:48:50,590 --> 01:48:53,590
He's still young, but he's a
poet with superb sensibility

1147
01:48:55,562 --> 01:48:58,264
This year, he was nominated for
the Sowol Literature Awards

1148
01:48:58,265 --> 01:49:00,399
And his poems are
quite provocative

1149
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:03,400
'The color ofthe sky,
like a cat dead for a month'

1150
01:49:04,604 --> 01:49:06,605
Verses like this

1151
01:49:06,606 --> 01:49:08,240
Sir

1152
01:49:08,241 --> 01:49:11,241
How can I write poetry?

1153
01:49:12,712 --> 01:49:14,280
It's difficult, isn't it?

1154
01:49:14,281 --> 01:49:15,814
To write poetry

1155
01:49:15,815 --> 01:49:17,917
It is so difficult

1156
01:49:17,918 --> 01:49:19,985
As hard as I try,

1157
01:49:19,986 --> 01:49:22,986
I can't seem to write poetry

1158
01:49:23,290 --> 01:49:26,290
How can I write poetry?

1159
01:49:26,726 --> 01:49:29,662
You said in your class...

1160
01:49:29,663 --> 01:49:32,663
that we all carry poetry
in our heart...

1161
01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:35,301
And that the poetry
trapped inside...

1162
01:49:35,302 --> 01:49:38,302
should get their wings
and fly away

1163
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:43,275
Did you really say that?

1164
01:49:43,276 --> 01:49:46,276
Wow, bravo!

1165
01:49:49,749 --> 01:49:52,749
To welcome the two poets here,

1166
01:49:53,286 --> 01:49:56,286
I'd like to dedicate a song

1167
01:50:42,669 --> 01:50:45,669
What are you doing here
alone, big sister?

1168
01:50:48,141 --> 01:50:51,076
Are you okay?

1169
01:50:51,077 --> 01:50:54,077
Are you drunk?

1170
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:12,464
Why are you crying, big sister?

1171
01:51:12,465 --> 01:51:15,465
Is something wrong?

1172
01:51:18,271 --> 01:51:20,172
Is it because of poetry?

1173
01:51:20,173 --> 01:51:23,173
Because you can't write any?

1174
01:53:12,051 --> 01:53:15,051
What's got into you?
On a Sunday?

1175
01:53:15,321 --> 01:53:18,321
I thought you'd be
sleeping all day

1176
01:53:36,376 --> 01:53:39,376
Gimme something to eat
I'm hungry.

1177
01:54:17,116 --> 01:54:20,116
Swirl it, swirl

1178
01:54:41,074 --> 01:54:44,074
I swirl pretty well, don't I?

1179
01:54:54,787 --> 01:54:56,388
Hello there

1180
01:54:56,389 --> 01:54:58,490
Wook's grandma's here

1181
01:54:58,491 --> 01:55:00,993
I see you have guests
I can come back later

1182
01:55:00,994 --> 01:55:03,428
No, please come in

1183
01:55:03,429 --> 01:55:06,429
They're people you know,
so please come in

1184
01:55:09,769 --> 01:55:10,702
Hello

1185
01:55:10,703 --> 01:55:13,703
Please say hello,
this is Heejin's mom

1186
01:55:15,508 --> 01:55:17,643
Hello

1187
01:55:17,644 --> 01:55:20,644
She is PARKJongwook's
grandma

1188
01:55:20,647 --> 01:55:23,647
She visited your house
the other day

1189
01:55:25,051 --> 01:55:27,819
She felt so bad and sorry...

1190
01:55:27,820 --> 01:55:30,689
that she went alone
to apologize,

1191
01:55:30,690 --> 01:55:33,690
but she couldn't meet you
Isn't that right?

1192
01:55:37,497 --> 01:55:40,497
Is Heejin's brother entering
mid. school next year?

1193
01:55:41,801 --> 01:55:43,535
Yes

1194
01:55:43,536 --> 01:55:45,370
Is he getting good grades?

1195
01:55:45,371 --> 01:55:47,539
I hope he is

1196
01:55:47,540 --> 01:55:50,475
- He's so so
- I see

1197
01:55:50,476 --> 01:55:53,045
He should study hard

1198
01:55:53,046 --> 01:55:56,046
Because his mom's managing
so hard on her own

1199
01:55:58,084 --> 01:56:01,084
Where are you going, ma'am?

1200
01:56:04,324 --> 01:56:06,358
Ma'am!

1201
01:56:06,359 --> 01:56:08,627
Why did you just leave?

1202
01:56:08,628 --> 01:56:11,628
Do you have the money ready?

1203
01:56:12,598 --> 01:56:14,099
Actually,

1204
01:56:14,100 --> 01:56:16,201
no

1205
01:56:16,202 --> 01:56:18,236
I came here to tell you that

1206
01:56:18,237 --> 01:56:19,871
Just in case you'd be waiting

1207
01:56:19,872 --> 01:56:22,872
Then what shall we do?

1208
01:56:23,476 --> 01:56:25,711
It's urgent

1209
01:56:25,712 --> 01:56:28,712
The talks are going well
with the girl's mom

1210
01:56:28,815 --> 01:56:31,216
It was really hard to make
her come all this way

1211
01:56:31,217 --> 01:56:34,217
That reporter helped us
arrange this meeting, okay?

1212
01:56:34,354 --> 01:56:37,354
How can you sayyou don't
have the money now?

1213
01:56:39,726 --> 01:56:42,227
Didn't you talk to
your daughter?

1214
01:56:42,228 --> 01:56:44,997
Not yet

1215
01:56:44,998 --> 01:56:47,998
Why not? You should have

1216
01:56:48,735 --> 01:56:51,735
Don't you understand
the situation?

1217
01:57:22,535 --> 01:57:25,437
Say, "grandpa, I love you,"
okay?

1218
01:57:25,438 --> 01:57:27,806
She's getting prettier
by the day

1219
01:57:27,807 --> 01:57:29,775
Let's see how she can kiss

1220
01:57:29,776 --> 01:57:32,776
Say, "I love you"
On the lips

1221
01:57:36,382 --> 01:57:37,482
Now, it's your turn

1222
01:57:37,483 --> 01:57:40,483
Who is it?

1223
01:57:43,589 --> 01:57:45,991
Good

1224
01:57:45,992 --> 01:57:48,992
Grandpa stinks

1225
01:57:51,197 --> 01:57:52,931
Oh, ma'am!

1226
01:57:52,932 --> 01:57:54,666
This is so sudden

1227
01:57:54,667 --> 01:57:56,968
Yes, it is so sudden, right?

1228
01:57:56,969 --> 01:57:59,604
Uh, right. What brings you here?

1229
01:57:59,605 --> 01:58:02,605
I have to talk to Mr. KANG

1230
01:58:10,450 --> 01:58:11,416
Don't!

1231
01:58:11,417 --> 01:58:14,417
Okay, don't!

1232
01:58:47,053 --> 01:58:50,053
PLEASE GIVE ME 5 MILLION WON
I BEG YOU, DON'T ASKWHY

1233
01:58:55,661 --> 01:58:58,661
I wanna say I'm borrowing
the money,

1234
01:58:59,932 --> 01:59:02,932
but I can't because it's useless

1235
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:06,936
Why should I?

1236
01:59:23,222 --> 01:59:26,222
WHY SHOULD I GIVE YOU
MONEY WITHOUT A REASON

1237
01:59:32,265 --> 01:59:35,265
So you're here to talk to
my father-in-law?

1238
01:59:35,501 --> 01:59:37,903
I guess it's something serious?

1239
01:59:37,904 --> 01:59:40,372
It's nothing serious

1240
01:59:40,373 --> 01:59:43,373
I just came for the money
he owes me

1241
01:59:44,343 --> 01:59:46,211
He owes you money?

1242
01:59:46,212 --> 01:59:49,014
What money?

1243
01:59:49,015 --> 01:59:50,215
Dad

1244
01:59:50,216 --> 01:59:53,216
Do you owe her money?

1245
02:00:23,649 --> 02:00:26,649
IS THIS BLACKMAIL?

1246
02:00:28,788 --> 02:00:31,423
It doesn't matter
whatever you think

1247
02:00:31,424 --> 02:00:34,424
I won't make any excuses

1248
02:00:40,533 --> 02:00:43,533
Yes, yes. Taeyeol's dad
said he'll be here soon

1249
02:00:43,669 --> 02:00:46,204
And Byungjin's dad
has an appointment,

1250
02:00:46,205 --> 02:00:48,907
but he'll join us an hour later

1251
02:00:48,908 --> 02:00:51,243
Yes, yes. Come in. Yes

1252
02:00:51,244 --> 02:00:54,244
Enjoyyour meal

1253
02:00:59,018 --> 02:01:02,018
So you finally got the money?

1254
02:01:04,857 --> 02:01:07,158
Then I'll be on my way

1255
02:01:07,159 --> 02:01:10,159
Sit. What's the rush?

1256
02:01:18,671 --> 02:01:21,039
It's all cash

1257
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:24,040
Did you really rob a bank?

1258
02:01:24,410 --> 02:01:27,410
- So the mom settled?
- Yes, she settled

1259
02:01:28,614 --> 02:01:31,614
Once the 30 million Won is
paid, it'll all be over

1260
02:01:32,351 --> 02:01:35,351
Since you paid your share,
NO PROBLEM!

1261
02:01:35,921 --> 02:01:37,522
Now everything's okay

1262
02:01:37,523 --> 02:01:40,358
That's why we're here for
a small celebratory drink

1263
02:01:40,359 --> 02:01:43,359
Since everyone has suffered

1264
02:01:43,663 --> 02:01:46,663
So is it all over now?

1265
02:01:47,733 --> 02:01:49,567
Totally?

1266
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:52,103
It's hard to say it's totally over

1267
02:01:52,104 --> 02:01:55,104
Ifthe victim's an adult,
a settlement is enough

1268
02:01:55,541 --> 02:01:57,809
But in the case ofa minor,

1269
02:01:57,810 --> 02:02:00,378
if someone informs the police,
an investigation's required

1270
02:02:00,379 --> 02:02:03,379
But we cleaned up everything
with the school and the press...

1271
02:02:05,284 --> 02:02:07,752
and reached a settlement
with the girl's mom

1272
02:02:07,753 --> 02:02:10,655
So there's nothing to
worry about anymore

1273
02:02:10,656 --> 02:02:13,656
I'm sure you haven't eaten yet,
why don't you join us?

1274
02:02:14,293 --> 02:02:17,293
- I have to go
- Really?

1275
02:03:25,297 --> 02:03:26,564
What?

1276
02:03:26,565 --> 02:03:27,799
Let's go!

1277
02:03:27,800 --> 02:03:30,800
Why?

1278
02:03:34,607 --> 02:03:37,607
Good bye, ma'am

1279
02:03:47,453 --> 02:03:50,453
Enjoyyour meal

1280
02:03:58,364 --> 02:04:01,364
Is it good?

1281
02:04:03,836 --> 02:04:06,836
Is it?

1282
02:04:08,974 --> 02:04:11,974
Take a bath when
you get home

1283
02:04:12,077 --> 02:04:14,145
Why?

1284
02:04:14,146 --> 02:04:16,047
Just because

1285
02:04:16,048 --> 02:04:19,048
Take a bath and cut your nails

1286
02:04:20,786 --> 02:04:23,786
Since you recently got a haircut,
you won't need one

1287
02:04:24,857 --> 02:04:27,158
You should look decent

1288
02:04:27,159 --> 02:04:30,128
And your mom's
coming tomorrow

1289
02:04:30,129 --> 02:04:33,097
Why's she coming?

1290
02:04:33,098 --> 02:04:36,098
I told her to come

1291
02:04:36,202 --> 02:04:39,202
It's been a while since
you've seen her

1292
02:04:58,891 --> 02:05:00,825
Look here

1293
02:05:00,826 --> 02:05:03,826
This part's still dirty

1294
02:05:04,096 --> 02:05:07,096
Was it too precious to clean?

1295
02:05:09,335 --> 02:05:12,335
You need to scrub the back of
your heels when you take a bath

1296
02:05:16,442 --> 02:05:19,442
Why do you even need
a scrubbing towel?

1297
02:05:19,612 --> 02:05:22,612
Is itjust for fun or
to use as a pocketchief?

1298
02:05:23,148 --> 02:05:25,583
You're always like this

1299
02:05:25,584 --> 02:05:28,186
You even bathe half-heartedly!

1300
02:05:28,187 --> 02:05:31,187
Even when you wash your face,
you just pat water on...

1301
02:05:31,257 --> 02:05:33,291
like a cat

1302
02:05:33,292 --> 02:05:36,292
Why won't you scrub your
ears and neck thoroughly?

1303
02:05:37,363 --> 02:05:40,363
You should always...

1304
02:05:40,733 --> 02:05:43,067
keep your body clean

1305
02:05:43,068 --> 02:05:46,068
A clean body makes a clean mind

1306
02:06:46,298 --> 02:06:49,298
Nice shot!

1307
02:06:52,705 --> 02:06:55,073
Great!

1308
02:06:55,074 --> 02:06:58,074
Perfect!

1309
02:07:12,625 --> 02:07:13,925
- Hey, boy
- Yes?

1310
02:07:13,926 --> 02:07:16,926
Come here. It's okay.

1311
02:07:28,340 --> 02:07:29,340
Big sister

1312
02:07:29,341 --> 02:07:31,943
Want me to teach you a trick?

1313
02:07:31,944 --> 02:07:34,679
Your form ain't right,
Detective PARK!

1314
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:37,680
What's wrong with my form?
I look cool enough

1315
02:07:47,326 --> 02:07:50,326
Big sister, your serve

1316
02:07:54,199 --> 02:07:56,067
Nice shot!

1317
02:07:56,068 --> 02:07:58,036
Great!

1318
02:07:58,037 --> 02:08:01,037
Our big sister's great!

1319
02:09:44,643 --> 02:09:47,643
...trying to look cute
with your eyes like this

1320
02:09:47,679 --> 02:09:49,947
Then how should
my eyes be like?

1321
02:09:49,948 --> 02:09:52,948
They should look like this

1322
02:10:07,900 --> 02:10:10,900
Since it's the last day,

1323
02:10:11,203 --> 02:10:12,670
you've brought me flowers

1324
02:10:12,671 --> 02:10:14,372
Thankyou

1325
02:10:14,373 --> 02:10:17,373
I'm touched

1326
02:10:17,810 --> 02:10:19,644
Actually

1327
02:10:19,645 --> 02:10:22,079
We didn't bring it

1328
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:24,582
Ms. YANG Mija placed it
there and left

1329
02:10:24,583 --> 02:10:27,583
Ms. YANG Mija?

1330
02:10:27,686 --> 02:10:30,521
She's even written a poem

1331
02:10:30,522 --> 02:10:33,522
But where has she gone?

1332
02:10:35,294 --> 02:10:38,294
Did anyone else bring a poem?

1333
02:10:38,864 --> 02:10:41,864
You were supposed to write
one poem by today

1334
02:10:42,434 --> 02:10:45,434
Anyone with a poem?

1335
02:10:46,371 --> 02:10:49,307
No one?

1336
02:10:49,308 --> 02:10:52,308
So the only one who has
written a poem is Ms. YANG

1337
02:10:54,446 --> 02:10:56,447
It's too difficult

1338
02:10:56,448 --> 02:10:57,782
No it's not

1339
02:10:57,783 --> 02:11:00,051
It's not difficult to write
a poem, but

1340
02:11:00,052 --> 02:11:03,052
to have the heart to write one

1341
02:11:03,388 --> 02:11:05,056
The heart to write a poem

1342
02:11:05,057 --> 02:11:06,524
Anyway,

1343
02:11:06,525 --> 02:11:08,860
Ms. YANG is not here, but

1344
02:11:08,861 --> 02:11:11,861
let's see what kind of poem
she has written

1345
02:11:12,664 --> 02:11:15,664
I'll read it on her behalf

1346
02:11:15,667 --> 02:11:18,636
The title is, 'Agnes' Song'

1347
02:11:18,637 --> 02:11:21,637
'Agnes' Song' byYANG Mija

1348
02:11:39,324 --> 02:11:42,324
Mom...

1349
02:12:24,469 --> 02:12:27,469
How is it over there?

1350
02:12:28,173 --> 02:12:31,173
How lonely is it?

1351
02:12:33,178 --> 02:12:36,178
Is it still glowing red at sunset?

1352
02:12:37,382 --> 02:12:40,382
Are the birds still singing on
the way to the forest?

1353
02:12:44,856 --> 02:12:47,856
Can you receive
the letter I dared not send?

1354
02:12:53,098 --> 02:12:55,733
Can I convey...

1355
02:12:55,734 --> 02:12:58,734
the confession I dared notmake?

1356
02:12:59,037 --> 02:13:02,037
Will time pass and roses fade?

1357
02:13:04,943 --> 02:13:07,943
Now it's time to say goodbye

1358
02:13:08,780 --> 02:13:11,780
Like the wind thatlingers
and then goes,

1359
02:13:12,384 --> 02:13:15,384
Just like shadows

1360
02:13:15,887 --> 02:13:18,887
To promises that never came,

1361
02:13:19,424 --> 02:13:22,424
to the love sealed till the end

1362
02:13:24,396 --> 02:13:27,396
To the grass kissing
my weary ankles

1363
02:13:30,836 --> 02:13:33,836
And to the tiny footsteps
following me

1364
02:13:41,847 --> 02:13:44,847
It's time to say goodbye

1365
02:13:46,918 --> 02:13:49,587
Now as darkness falls

1366
02:13:49,588 --> 02:13:52,588
Will a candle be lit again?

1367
02:13:54,793 --> 02:13:57,793
Here I pray...

1368
02:13:58,263 --> 02:14:01,263
nobody shall cry...

1369
02:14:03,969 --> 02:14:06,969
and for you to know...

1370
02:14:08,573 --> 02:14:11,573
how deeply I loved you

1371
02:14:16,348 --> 02:14:19,348
The long wait in the middle
of a hot summer day

1372
02:14:21,653 --> 02:14:24,653
An old path resembling
my father's face

1373
02:14:27,726 --> 02:14:30,726
Even the lonesome wild flower
shyly turning away

1374
02:14:34,366 --> 02:14:37,366
How deeply loved

1375
02:14:39,704 --> 02:14:42,704
How my heart fluttered at
hearing your faint song

1376
02:14:49,681 --> 02:14:52,681
I bless you

1377
02:14:59,958 --> 02:15:02,927
Before crossing the black river

1378
02:15:02,928 --> 02:15:05,928
With my soul's last breath

1379
02:15:09,734 --> 02:15:12,734
I am beginning to dream...

1380
02:15:14,606 --> 02:15:17,606
a bright sunny morning...

1381
02:15:18,376 --> 02:15:21,376
again  I awake,
blinded by the light...

1382
02:15:22,047 --> 02:15:25,047
and meet you...
