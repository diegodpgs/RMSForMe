1
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,600
It's almost new.

2
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,100
Three hundred cartridges.

3
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,900
The guy who
gave it to me said...

4
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,400
you can hit
as far as three kilometers.

5
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,300
How much are you asking
for all of this?

6
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,100
One thousand dirhams.

7
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,100
One thousand dirhams?

8
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,400
I'll give you five hundred.

9
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,300
And a goat.

10
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,700
With this rifle, your sons
will kill plenty of jackals.

11
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,400
Here, let one of your boys try.

12
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,000
Let Yussef shoot.

13
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,200
Dad, I want to shoot first.

14
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,000
This is the safety.
Push it in when you're ready.

15
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,000
If he doesn't hit the jackals,
at least he'll scare the shit out of them.

16
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,400
Your turn Yussef.

17
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,700
He shoots better than you.

18
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,300
Good luck,
have a good day.

19
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
God bless you.

20
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Kill at least three jackals.

21
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,800
Make sure no one
sees you with the rifle...

22
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,800
if you see someone coming, hide it.

23
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,300
What are you doing?

24
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,100
I told you,
don't spy on her.

25
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,800
What do you care?

26
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,500
Move it.

27
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,600
Five to two.

28
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,900
There's a jackaI.

29
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,900
Where?

30
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,900
Over there.

31
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,000
What are you doing,
you idiot?

32
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,600
Zohra doesn't mind.

33
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,900
She doesn't, but I do.

34
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,700
This is between her and me.

35
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:54,100
You're both pigs.
Next time I'm going to tell Dad.

36
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,100
Stay out of this.

37
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,700
If you want me to stay out of it,
don't do it.

38
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,800
What are you doing?

39
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,900
Hassan said this bullet
could reach three kilometers.

40
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,200
That rock didn't move.

41
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,800
You don't know how to shoot.
Give me the rifle.

42
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
See.

43
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,100
Yeah, but that's not
three kilometers.

44
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,700
I bet the bullet
can't hit that far.

45
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,500
These bullets are lame.

46
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,100
You're not aiming right.

47
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,900
What'll you give me
if I hit that car?

48
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,400
I'll shoot.

49
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,500
You see? Nothing.

50
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,900
Let me shoot.

51
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,800
Shoot at it.

52
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,900
See... nothing.

53
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,800
You're right, they're useless.

54
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,700
Where are these kids?

55
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,500
Where are you?

56
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,600
I'm coming to get you...

57
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
You win.

58
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,600
Did you brush your teeth?

59
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,700
Sleep with angels, my darling.

60
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,700
Sleep well, sweetie.

61
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,900
You are already sharing a room...

62
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,200
didn't we agree
to sleep with the lights off?

63
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,700
There's nothing to be scared of.

64
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,300
No, that won't happen to you.

65
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,900
How can I be
in two places at once?

66
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,900
I'm just asking you
to take them for today.

67
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,500
I can't, the mister is still home.

68
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,100
And they aren't going out?

69
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,200
No, I don't think so.

70
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,900
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

71
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,800
I can't Amelia.

72
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,900
Please, it's my son's wedding.

73
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,800
Just for the day, Lucia.
I'll be back for them tonight.

74
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,100
And what do I say to Mrs. Catherine?

75
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,900
I don't know.
Tell her they're your nephews.

76
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Right, because they look
so much like me...

77
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,100
with my American looking face!

78
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,600
What's up?

79
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,700
Hi Auntie.

80
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,800
Great to see you, Santiago.

81
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,900
They're really shy.

82
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,900
What? These kids
are coming with us?

83
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,200
I couldn't find anyone to watch them.

84
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,100
Their parents won't return tonight.

85
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,100
Why bring them?
They'll drive you crazy.

86
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,400
Don't worry,
they're very good kids.

87
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,700
Don't you want to
leave them with somebody?

88
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,200
I know a girI who
can take care of them.

89
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,100
Are you crazy?
I have to take them with me.

90
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,400
I can't leave them
with just anybody.

91
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,400
Are you sure, Auntie?

92
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,100
The ball was out.

93
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,200
That was out.

94
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,000
No, it was good.

95
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,400
That was out.

96
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,500
I'm deaf, not blind.

97
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,000
You're out.

98
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:00,200
You shouldn't have lost your temper.
We lost the game.

99
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,000
It wasn't my fault,
it was the ref.

100
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,800
If you hadn't been thrown out,
we would've won the game.

101
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,500
Why are you
in a bad mood?

102
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,600
She's always in a bad mood
because nobody's fucked her yet.

103
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,600
I'm gonna fuck your dad
to get rid of my mood.

104
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,800
I'll see you at the J-Pop.

105
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,600
What do you want to eat?

106
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,500
I said I'd meet my friends
from the team at J-Pop.

107
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,100
Didn't you tell me
we would have lunch together?

108
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,900
Dad, I told you I was
going to eat with them.

109
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,800
You never pay attention to me.

110
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,100
My mother always
paid attention to me.

111
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,900
Why do you want to fight?

112
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:40,900
I miss your mother too.

113
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,400
I'm doing the best I can.

114
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,200
Don't forget
the dentist at three.

115
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,700
Take care.

116
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,300
Do you have a table?

117
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,700
Why all the way in the corner?

118
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,800
Isn't the view nice?

119
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,000
Do you like him?

120
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,800
Hello.

121
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,100
Hello.

122
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,600
Can I play with you?

123
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,100
Or you can
have a drink with us?

124
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,600
Tell him to speak slowly.

125
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,000
Can you say that
a little slower?

126
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,200
You assholes,
how embarrassing.

127
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,200
What's the matter?

128
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,000
They look at us
like we're monsters.

129
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,900
Oh, come off it.

130
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,300
What are you doing?

131
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,600
Now they're going to meet
the reaI hairy monster.

132
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,100
<i>Don't forget your appointment
with the dentist. Papa.</i>

133
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,600
I have to go.

134
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,800
I'll see you at your place, then.

135
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,800
What are you doing here?

136
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,500
Something we ate
gave us a stomach ache.

137
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,800
The goats will die
if they don't eat.

138
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,900
Wash your face
and take them out again.

139
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,500
My stomach hurts.

140
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,100
There are other
chores to do then.

141
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,700
Move it. Let's go.

142
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,000
<b>God bless. Bye, bye.</b>

143
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,000
Thank you,
I'll see you tomorrow.

144
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,700
Tell your mother
to prepare dinner.

145
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,500
Did you kill any jackals?

146
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,900
We shot at them,
but didn't hit any.

147
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,000
You have to kill them.
If not, they're going to eat all the goats.

148
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,800
Why did you come home late?

149
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,000
They closed the road,
we took the long way.

150
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,000
Apparently some terrorists
killed an American tourist.

151
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,900
An American?

152
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,000
Yes, the terrorists attacked
a tour bus on the road.

153
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,400
No, there aren't any terrorists here.

154
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,800
You never know.

155
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,200
How do you know
the American died?

156
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:24,700
That's what they were saying.
The police are looking for the culprits.

157
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,300
<b>Yes, this is Mexico.</b>

158
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,600
<b>Yeah... it's full of Mexicans.</b>

159
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,200
Don't talk like that.

160
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,900
It's not true.

161
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,000
How wonderfuI, you made it.

162
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,800
You decided to bring them?

163
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,200
Hey, what's up?

164
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,000
Oh, son, look how handsome.

165
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,600
You look like Julio Preciado.

166
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,600
Forget Julio Preciado,
he looks like Luis MigueI.

167
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,000
These are the kids
I take care of.

168
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,600
Say hi to Luis.

169
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,000
Lucio, come here.

170
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,400
This is Mike and Debbie.

171
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,300
Take them to play.

172
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:11,600
Mom, I don't know how you did it,
but it zipped up perfectly.

173
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,300
And it's been 15 years
since I wore this dress.

174
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,200
You haven't changed a bit, Ma.

175
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,700
Working dear, hard work...
that's what keeps you young.

176
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,200
What are you guys laughing about?

177
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,000
Nothing Ma, nothing.

178
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,800
I'll give a buck to the first
who catches a chicken.

179
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,800
CarefuI with the 'huevos. '

180
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,700
Very good, Debbie got one.

181
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,100
Debbie's the winner.

182
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,300
Okay, now we need another five.

183
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,300
So we have five chickens here.

184
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,800
Okay, now who's going to help me?

185
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,300
You? Okay, come.

186
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,400
Hold it tight, like this.

187
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,300
Grab it right.

188
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:26,100
Everyone back up...
give me some room.

189
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,300
I need your phone.
I will pay.

190
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
The bullet didn't
touch her spine.

191
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,000
If she stays like this,
she will bleed to death.

192
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,600
Is there anything
we can do?

193
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,200
I have to stitch up the wound
to stop the bleeding.

194
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,700
And tell him
her clavicle is broken.

195
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,400
We have to
hold her down.

196
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,900
Here are the sterilized drill bits.

197
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,400
You have cavities
in two molars.

198
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,800
What are you doing?

199
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,600
What's wrong with you?

200
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,200
Get out.

201
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,300
Get out right now.

202
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,500
Yes, I'll let him know.

203
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,200
That's Mr. Wataya's daughter.

204
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,100
Thank you.

205
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,500
Are you Yasujiro Wataya's daughter?

206
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,900
She's deaf-mute...

207
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:02,900
Face her when you speak
so she can read your lips.

208
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,100
Are you Yasujiro Wataya's daughter?

209
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:16,500
We are Yoshjo Hamano and Kenji
Mamiya of the Metropolitan Police.

210
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,100
We would like
to see your father.

211
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:40,500
No, it's nothing bad.
We just want to talk to him.

212
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,000
Do you know
where he is?

213
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:49,100
Please tell him to call.

214
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,200
Don't be scared.
We just want to talk to him.

215
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,900
Thank you.

216
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,700
<i>Chieko, I waited for you.
I have a meeting so I'll be back late.</i>

217
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,700
<i>I left you a bento box. Papa.</i>

218
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:26,100
<i>I'm on my way to your place.</i>

219
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,700
Where are you?

220
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,400
Hurry up!

221
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,500
<i>Moroccan officials
are investigating suspects...</i>

222
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,300
<i>in the shooting of
an American tourist.</i>

223
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,200
<i>Officials said the shooting
took place...</i>

224
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,600
Are you ready?

225
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,900
Yeah, I'm just going to get my bag.

226
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,800
The cops came again?

227
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,900
<b>Yeah. They hadn't come in nine months.
But these were different cops.</b>

228
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,400
Did they come to ask
about your mother's death?

229
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:33,600
No, but they're probably going
to ask my dad about the same things.

230
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,800
They're just not convinced,
are they?

231
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,800
<b>Believe it or not,
I liked one of the cops.</b>

232
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,500
Idiot.

233
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,100
Did you put on some panties?

234
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,000
Are you sure
it was here?

235
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,900
An American stopped me.

236
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,300
I was scared.
He was covered in blood.

237
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,200
Where was the bus stopped?

238
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,500
Over there.

239
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,600
<i>Captain Alarid... Captain Alarid.</i>

240
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,400
<i>I found cartridges.</i>

241
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,100
We found four.
Here's one.

242
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,600
Did you search all over?

243
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,300
Yes, the whole mountain.

244
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,100
They're from around here.

245
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,100
Find out who has
a. 270 caliber rifle.

246
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,200
Hassan Ibrahim?

247
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,700
- Yes.
- Drop your weapon.

248
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,900
I don't have a weapon.

249
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Drop it now.

250
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,200
I told you to drop
your weapon.

251
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,800
This is just my knife.

252
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,500
Get on the ground.

253
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,600
What did we do?

254
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,800
Get down on the ground...
face down.

255
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,000
Don't look at me.

256
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,100
What did we do?

257
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,900
Take these skins to Najib,
see if he wants to buy them.

258
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,200
Why did you shoot at the bus?

259
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,000
I didn't shoot at anyone.

260
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,400
Then who?

261
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,400
It wasn't me.

262
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,600
That was your rifle.

263
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,500
I sold it yesterday.

264
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,100
Who did you sell it to?

265
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,100
Do you know where
Abdullah Adboum lives?

266
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,900
Yes.

267
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,400
You have to go over those mountains.

268
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,800
Who lives
in this area?

269
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,300
We live here with our mother.
Abdullah lives on the other side.

270
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,200
If you're Iying, I'm going to
come back and cut your balls off.

271
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,500
You can come back
anytime you like.

272
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,600
Don't walk
between the graves.

273
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,900
Papa... Papa...

274
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,100
What happened?

275
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,300
The police...
they're looking for you.

276
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,600
Me? Why?

277
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,200
No, not for you...
they're looking for us.

278
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,800
Looking for you?
Why?

279
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,200
<b>Because of the tourist.</b>

280
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:28,800
What tourist?

281
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,700
The American...
Yussef killed her.

282
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,100
Liar, we both did.

283
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,500
What are you saying?

284
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,700
Yussef started shooting
at the cars...

285
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,300
because Hassan said
that the bullet could go far.

286
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,200
Liar, you started shooting at the cars.

287
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,400
<b>But you killed her.</b>

288
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,900
What are you saying?

289
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,800
Yussef killed the American
and he spies on Zohra naked...

290
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,800
and Zohra lets him watch her.

291
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,300
That's garbage.

292
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,800
It's not garbage.
She's a street girI and he spies on her.

293
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,600
Time to drink!

294
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:33,400
This song is dedicated
from Luis to Patricia...

295
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,700
the most beautifuI bride
in the world.

296
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:14,100
I think Aunt Amelia has to dance.

297
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:05,300
Amelia, can I have this dance?

298
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,500
I don't think your wife
would like that.

299
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:13,300
Ohh, she passed away 10 years ago.
Come on Amelia.

300
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:03,400
Let's go dance... You have
something white on your face.

301
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,700
<b>Don't get excited,
it's only cake.</b>

302
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,500
<i>Today, near Tazarine,
there was an incident.</i>

303
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,300
<i>An American was shot.</i>

304
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:29,300
<i>Authorities say it
could have been a robbery.</i>

305
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:33,200
<i>But, the American government was
quick to suggest a terrorist link.</i>

306
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,400
<i>Minister Hassan HazaI
has said...</i>

307
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:40,000
<i>that terrorist cells have been
eradicated in our country...</i>

308
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,300
<i>and one act
of vulgar banditry...</i>

309
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:48,300
<i>followed by superficiaI evaluations
the U.S. places on it...</i>

310
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,700
<i>cannot ruin our image
or the economy.</i>

311
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:59,000
You have to turn on the
air-conditioning, my husband is ill.

312
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:02,200
No air-conditioning,
no gasoline near. I'm sorry.

313
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:06,200
Please, it's too hot.
We can get dehydrated.

314
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,300
Who are they?

315
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,500
My cousins.

316
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,000
Is he deaf-mute
like us?

317
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:53,200
No, but he understands some.

318
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:01,200
What is your name?

319
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,900
Chieko.

320
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,600
My name's Haruki.

321
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,800
It's whisky.

322
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:53,200
Do the cops come around here?

323
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,900
Sometimes.

324
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,100
You smell good.

325
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:37,100
Welcome home... may I help you?

326
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:51,200
Are you sure
you want him to come now?

327
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,600
Is this Detective Mamiya?

328
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:15,200
The deaf-mute girI you met this
afternoon asked me to call.

329
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:17,400
Yes, her.

330
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:23,900
She says she needs to talk to you,
alone... about her father.

331
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:27,300
Why did you do this?

332
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,100
Why did you do this?

333
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:34,300
Answer me, damn it!

334
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,700
We were testing the rifle.

335
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:40,800
Are you idiots?

336
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,700
You killed a woman.

337
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,300
And you...

338
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,600
You got naked
so your brother could watch?

339
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:54,600
Zohra got naked lots of times
so Yussef could watch her.

340
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,200
Is it true or not?

341
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,000
Is it true or not?

342
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,500
Why did you do this to us?

343
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,100
Where's the rifle?

344
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:26,400
Where's the rifle?

345
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,100
I told you,
a hunter gave it to me.

346
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:30,800
What hunter?

347
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:39,200
A Japanese hunter...
gave it to me.

348
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:43,800
I've got a picture.
She can get it.

349
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,400
Go get it.

350
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:14,100
He's holding the rifle
he gave me.

351
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,500
We're going to Najib's house.

352
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,700
If the cops come,
tell them we went south.

353
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:05,700
This Abdullah doesn't live
in the area you told us.

354
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:07,500
Are you playing with us?

355
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,300
He lives in the area
he told you.

356
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,400
He lives there?

357
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:15,400
You're going to take us.

358
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,100
They're over there.

359
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:02,000
The police, the police.

360
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:03,800
Run... run.

361
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,700
Get down.

362
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:41,400
Mom, stay here tonight.

363
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:45,500
I can't, I have to get these kids home.
It's almost dawn.

364
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:47,800
<b>But this fucking guy
is really drunk.</b>

365
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,200
Drunk my ass. I'm fine.
I'll be right back.

366
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:54,900
Stay a little while,
the party's just starting.

367
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
I would like to, but these kids
have soccer practice tomorrow.

368
01:20:58,100 --> 01:20:59,200
See you soon, Son.

369
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,400
Congratulations, my darling.

370
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:06,400
Take care of my grandchild.
I'm dying to be a grandmother.

371
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:07,900
Seriously, you're not drunk man?

372
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,400
Drunk my ass.
I'm fine. I'll be back.

373
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:15,500
Remember, they got you once already
and you got in a lot of trouble.

374
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,700
<b>Bye, Ma...</b>

375
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:21,400
If things don't work here,
I'll meet you with the 'gringos. '

376
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,300
Hey, be carefuI.

377
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:04,800
I'll cross the border
through Tecate...

378
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:07,700
that will get us to
San Diego super fast.

379
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:46,800
Don't say anything.
Let me do the talking.

380
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:49,100
<b>But you're provoking him.</b>

381
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,000
I was just kidding.

382
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,800
What now?
Motherfucker...

383
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,700
What's that?

384
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,500
I heard you... stop shouting.

385
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:37,600
Don't shout at me.

386
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,100
Stop shouting at me.

387
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,600
Easy Santiago, please.

388
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:13,800
What are you doing?

389
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:25,100
What are you doing, Santiago?
What are you doing!

390
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:28,500
See, I told you!
You shouldn't have brought them.

391
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:32,200
Santiago, stop acting like a
madman and stop the car.

392
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:34,600
Please, Santiago, stop!

393
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:37,500
Shut those kids up!
Shut them up!

394
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,700
Please stop, Santiago.

395
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:18,300
Motherfuckers, fucking gringo assholes,
here they come.

396
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:04,200
Get out. Get out.

397
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:05,500
Are you crazy? Where?

398
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,900
Get out. If they catch us,
we're all screwed...

399
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,600
I'll lose them,
then come back for you.

400
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:13,400
Get out, for Christ sake!

401
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:15,500
Santiago, calm down.

402
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:20,100
Aunt Amelia, get out...
for the love of God!

403
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:46,300
Santiago is going to
come back soon and...

404
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,900
the sun is going to rise.

405
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:19,500
Why can't you call
another ambulance?

406
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,000
They just told me
the ambulance isn't coming.

407
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:24,600
And you know we don't
have another ambulance.

408
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:36,600
He wants to know how
he will get his wife out of here.

409
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:39,700
Tell him they said
his embassy will deaI with it.

410
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:48,300
The Americans
stopped the ambulance.

411
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:51,300
They want to send a helicopter,
but there are problems.

412
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:12,300
Good evening.

413
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:15,600
The doorman called to say
you wanted to talk to me.

414
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:16,800
I don't understand.

415
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:19,400
Could you speak slowly?

416
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:22,400
I'm sorry.

417
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,400
What was it
you wanted to tell me?

418
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:44,400
Do you have tea?

419
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:19,300
<i>"My father had nothing to do
with my mother's death. "</i>

420
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:23,900
What's this?

421
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:49,400
When your mother jumped off the
balcony, your father was asleep?

422
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:41,200
You saw her jump?

423
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:52,900
You've already told the other officers?

424
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,800
What are you talking about?

425
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:57,500
Does your father still hunt?

426
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:18,800
There was an incident involving a rifle
in your father's name.

427
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:22,700
That's why we want to talk to him.
Understand?

428
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:10,600
Your father isn't going to jaiI.
We just need to talk to him.

429
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:20,500
I have to go.

430
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,500
I really have to go.

431
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:35,400
What are you doing?

432
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,700
What are you doing?

433
01:41:57,700 --> 01:41:58,800
Please stop.

434
01:42:00,700 --> 01:42:04,400
No, this is wrong.
You're just a girI.

435
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:12,400
Enough, stop it!

436
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:02,200
Give me that rifle.

437
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:04,000
They're going to kill us.

438
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,700
They're going to kill us.

439
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:21,600
I killed the American. I was the
only one who shot at you.

440
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,100
They did nothing... nothing.

441
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:41,000
Kill me, but save my brother, he did
nothing... nothing.

442
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:54,400
Save my brother...
he did nothing.

443
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:58,700
They're alone.

444
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:03,100
They are children,
they will die.

445
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:34,900
There's no need to apologize.

446
02:09:08,300 --> 02:09:13,500
Mr. Wataya, this officer
has been looking for you.

447
02:09:17,100 --> 02:09:21,500
Good evening, I'm Lieutenant Mamiya.

448
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:24,700
Good evening, how can I help you?

449
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:30,200
Sir, there was an incident and...

450
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:33,400
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

451
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:37,100
do you own a. 270 caliber
Winchester M70 rifle?

452
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:40,300
Registration number...

453
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:45,300
UK-9023.

454
02:09:46,100 --> 02:09:49,500
I don't remember the number,
but I did have a rifle like that.

455
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:53,200
Is it true that you gave that rifle
to a Mr. Hassan Ibrahim...

456
02:09:53,300 --> 02:09:55,000
who lives in Morocco?

457
02:09:55,300 --> 02:09:56,500
Hassan Ibrahim?

458
02:09:58,200 --> 02:10:00,900
He says he was
your guide in a hunt.

459
02:10:01,100 --> 02:10:03,200
Hassan? Yes,
I remember him well.

460
02:10:03,300 --> 02:10:08,900
He was a good guide and a very
good man, I gave him the rifle in thanks.

461
02:10:11,100 --> 02:10:12,600
Did anything happen?

462
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:17,000
That rifle was used
in an attempted murder...

463
02:10:17,100 --> 02:10:21,200
and the Moroccan police want
to confirm it's not off the black market.

464
02:10:21,300 --> 02:10:23,900
No, I gave it to him.

465
02:10:25,700 --> 02:10:28,200
Is Hassan ok?

466
02:10:29,700 --> 02:10:31,500
I don't know about that.

467
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,100
Am I legally involved?

468
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:43,600
Not for the moment, but can you
come down to the station tomorrow?

469
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:45,500
I have a few questions.

470
02:10:47,700 --> 02:10:49,000
Can I leave now?

471
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,500
Good night.

472
02:10:55,700 --> 02:10:56,800
<b>Excuse me.</b>

473
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:03,700
I heard from your daughter...
about your wife on the balcony.

474
02:11:04,900 --> 02:11:06,200
I'm very sorry.

475
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:08,500
What balcony?

476
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:14,300
About how your wife killed herself
by jumping off the balcony.

477
02:11:22,300 --> 02:11:26,800
My wife never jumped off a balcony.
She shot herself in the head.

478
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,200
My daughter was the first to find her.

479
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:33,900
<b>I've explained it
to the police many times.</b>

480
02:11:35,700 --> 02:11:38,200
Don't bother us with that anymore.

481
02:11:39,300 --> 02:11:42,000
I'm very sorry sir, we won't
bother you anymore.

482
02:11:42,300 --> 02:11:43,500
Good night.

483
02:12:36,100 --> 02:12:37,700
Another shochu.

484
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:19,100
<i>Susan Jones, who was wounded
in a terrorist attack in Morocco...</i>

485
02:13:19,200 --> 02:13:23,100
<i>was discharged from a Casablanca
