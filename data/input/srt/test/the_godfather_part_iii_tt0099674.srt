1
00:01:51,482 --> 00:01:53,442
<i>My dear children...</i>

2
00:01:53,817 --> 00:01:58,614
<i>...it is now better than several years
since I moved to New York...</i>

3
00:01:58,822 --> 00:02:02,910
<i>...and I haven't seen you
as much as I would like to.</i>

4
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:07,164
<i>I hope you will come to this ceremony
of Papal honours...</i>

5
00:02:07,373 --> 00:02:09,750
<i>...given for my charitable work.</i>

6
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:15,339
<i>The only wealth in this world is children.</i>

7
00:02:15,506 --> 00:02:18,634
<i>More than all the money and power
on Earth.</i>

8
00:02:19,385 --> 00:02:21,845
<i>You are my treasure.</i>

9
00:02:23,305 --> 00:02:25,599
<i>Anthony and Mary...</i>

10
00:02:25,808 --> 00:02:30,563
<i>...although I entrusted your education to
your mother for your own best interest...</i>

11
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:36,902
<i>I look forward to seeing you, and to
a new period of harmony in our lives.</i>

12
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,866
<i>Perhaps you might prevail upon your
mother to come to this celebration...</i>

13
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:48,372
<i>...and that from time to time, we can all
see each other at family functions.</i>

14
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:54,086
<i>Anyway, I remain your loving father.</i>

15
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:27,077
Hail Mary, full of grace...

16
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:33,250
...blessed art Thou amongst women...

17
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:37,004
...and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb,
Jesus.

18
00:03:37,838 --> 00:03:41,759
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

19
00:04:06,617 --> 00:04:12,665
Almighty God, bless the insignia
of Saint Sebastian the Martyr...

20
00:04:12,831 --> 00:04:19,088
...that it may contribute to the sacredness
of him to whom it is given.

21
00:04:31,976 --> 00:04:38,899
Do you, Michael, promise to be faithful
to the noble purposes of this Order...

22
00:04:39,066 --> 00:04:43,654
...to have a special care for the poor,
the needy and those who are ill?

23
00:04:43,821 --> 00:04:45,698
I do so promise.

24
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:04,133
May the blessing of Almighty God...

25
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,263
Father, Son and Holy Spirit...

26
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:14,810
...descend upon you
and remain with you forever.

27
00:06:48,362 --> 00:06:51,699
Vincent, our name is not on the list.

28
00:06:53,617 --> 00:06:56,620
Write it in. Mancini. M-A-N-C-I-N-I.

29
00:06:59,206 --> 00:07:01,750
- Problem?
- My name isn't on the list.

30
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:06,714
- Then you have to leave immediately.
- You want to dance with me?

31
00:07:06,922 --> 00:07:09,550
Joe, it's Vinnie. These are our guests.

32
00:07:09,717 --> 00:07:12,469
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir.

33
00:07:12,636 --> 00:07:14,847
Welcome to the party.

34
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,695
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you. This is my husband.

35
00:08:11,862 --> 00:08:14,573
- Sit down.
- My son, Anthony.

36
00:08:15,115 --> 00:08:20,246
The Order of Saint Sebastian is one of
the highest honours the Church awards.

37
00:08:20,412 --> 00:08:22,540
It was first granted by Pope...

38
00:08:22,706 --> 00:08:26,126
What about Mr Corleone's connections
with gambling?

39
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:28,504
The press kits have...

40
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:32,424
- And involvement with the underworld?
- Cut the crap.

41
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:35,719
The Pope, the Holy Father himself...

42
00:08:35,886 --> 00:08:40,599
...has today blessed Michael Corleone.
Do you know better than the Pope?

43
00:08:41,392 --> 00:08:44,520
Vincent! She loves you.

44
00:08:44,687 --> 00:08:46,522
Yeah?

45
00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:51,735
I love you too.

46
00:08:57,783 --> 00:09:01,203
Hi, Vincent. I remember you.

47
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,750
- From where?
- The last party we were at together.

48
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:11,213
- Did you come to the club?
- No, it was a wedding.

49
00:09:12,256 --> 00:09:15,467
I was eight and you were 15.

50
00:09:15,843 --> 00:09:18,804
I had many girlfriends when I was 15.

51
00:09:18,971 --> 00:09:21,181
- Eight-year-olds?
- Especially them.

52
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:25,561
Where's Mary?

53
00:09:25,728 --> 00:09:30,316
Would somebody please hail Mary?
Excuse me, Your Excellency.

54
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:34,987
You haven't kissed me hello yet.
Relatives always kiss.

55
00:09:35,154 --> 00:09:38,824
- Now we're related?
- I'm your little cousin.

56
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:49,627
- Who's your father?
- I'll give you a hint.

57
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:52,463
He's Italian.

58
00:09:53,797 --> 00:09:56,258
Mary, we've been waiting for you.

59
00:09:56,425 --> 00:10:00,095
Remember to keep your voice low.

60
00:10:00,304 --> 00:10:03,098
And smile. Don't forget to smile.

61
00:10:22,952 --> 00:10:26,997
The honorary chairman of
the Vito Corleone Foundation:

62
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:30,834
...my daughter, Mary Corleone.

63
00:10:39,593 --> 00:10:41,470
Thanks.

64
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:47,601
I think I inherited my father's love
for speechmaking. Here it goes.

65
00:10:48,852 --> 00:10:53,357
The Vito Corleone Foundation helps
the poor in every country...

66
00:10:53,524 --> 00:10:58,153
...gives grants to artists,
funds medical research...

67
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,075
...and is particularly dedicated
to the resurrection of Sicily.

68
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:05,327
Archbishop Gilday...

69
00:11:05,494 --> 00:11:11,917
...here is 100 million dollars for the poor
of Sicily, in the name of Vito Corleone.

70
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:15,296
Don't spend it all in one place.

71
00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:38,235
Mary, I'm so proud of you.

72
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:46,702
Michael...

73
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:50,289
You've done a wonderful thing for Sicily.

74
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:54,376
Let's hope that the money gets
to the people who need it.

75
00:11:54,585 --> 00:11:55,961
Amen.

76
00:11:58,464 --> 00:12:01,008
...the most important part:
Johnny Fontane!

77
00:12:09,433 --> 00:12:12,519
Thank you very much.
I'm happy to be here.

78
00:12:12,686 --> 00:12:18,025
I would like you to join me in honouring
Commendatore Michael Corleone.

79
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:25,866
I have something special
for our godfather.

80
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:30,538
I happen to know his favourite song.
Michael, where are you going?

81
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:34,875
I'm off to the kitchen
to hear some Tony Bennett records.

82
00:12:35,584 --> 00:12:38,337
Your favourite song: "Salsiccia's Own".

83
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:42,091
I'm having a salsiccia sandwich.
I'll be back.

84
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,127
Hello, Kay.

85
00:13:27,845 --> 00:13:31,056
Congratulations, Michael.
That's quite an honour.

86
00:13:31,223 --> 00:13:34,351
But a little expensive, wouldn't you say?

87
00:13:36,645 --> 00:13:39,815
- Cake?
- No, thank you.

88
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:56,707
- It's been a long time, hasn't it?
- Yeah.

89
00:13:56,874 --> 00:13:59,418
- Eight years.
- Yeah.

90
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:01,962
You look wonderful.

91
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:10,012
Your son has something he wants to
talk to you about. I came here for him.

92
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:50,386
- What's wrong with being a lawyer?
- He wants his life to be in music.

93
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,225
Music is great, I love music.
But he should finish what he started.

94
00:14:56,392 --> 00:14:57,935
Anthony...

95
00:14:58,102 --> 00:15:01,313
- I'm going my own way.
- Your own way?

96
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,107
- Professional singer?
- Yes.

97
00:15:03,274 --> 00:15:06,652
What happens if you fail?

98
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:10,948
- I won't fail.
- Men always believe that.

99
00:15:11,115 --> 00:15:15,035
A law degree is like taking out insurance.

100
00:15:15,244 --> 00:15:19,540
- After that you can work for me...
- I will never work for you.

101
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:23,085
I have bad memories.

102
00:15:23,794 --> 00:15:26,547
Every family has bad memories.

103
00:15:30,092 --> 00:15:34,430
I'll always be your son, but won't have
anything to do with your business.

104
00:15:37,057 --> 00:15:41,103
Anthony... Finish the law degree.

105
00:15:42,313 --> 00:15:43,898
No.

106
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:04,877
Well, that he got from you. That "no".

107
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:13,219
- You could've helped me convince him.
- Convince him of what?

108
00:16:13,385 --> 00:16:15,512
Of what?

109
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,559
He throws his life away.
He throws greatness away.

110
00:16:21,393 --> 00:16:23,771
This is greatness?

111
00:16:24,313 --> 00:16:28,943
Now that you're so respectable,
you're more dangerous than ever.

112
00:16:29,109 --> 00:16:33,614
I preferred you when you were
just a common Mafia hood.

113
00:16:34,448 --> 00:16:36,200
Okay.

114
00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:40,412
- Can we talk common sense here?
- All right.

115
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:50,256
Tony knows that you killed Fredo.

116
00:16:56,428 --> 00:16:59,682
- What did you come here for?
- To protect my son.

117
00:16:59,848 --> 00:17:05,062
Not to see you disguised by your
church. That was a shameful ceremony.

118
00:17:09,316 --> 00:17:12,152
I spent my life protecting my son.

119
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,990
I spent my life protecting my family!

120
00:17:16,198 --> 00:17:18,993
Let's be reasonable, okay?

121
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:24,248
That's your big thing, isn't it, Michael?
Reason.

122
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:28,794
- Backed up by murder.
- Oh, God.

123
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,591
- You hate me. You hate me.
- No.

124
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,885
I don't hate you.

125
00:17:37,303 --> 00:17:39,847
I dread you.

126
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:49,023
I did what I could, Kay, to protect all
of you from the horrors of this world.

127
00:17:50,357 --> 00:17:53,193
But you became my horror.

128
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:06,248
The children still love you, though.
Especially Mary.

129
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:11,086
That's something.

130
00:18:12,922 --> 00:18:17,092
We can build on that. For their sake.

131
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:22,348
Let's try.

132
00:18:22,514 --> 00:18:27,895
Only if you let Tony go free to have
his own life, away from you.

133
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:37,696
I'll let Tony go.

134
00:18:39,406 --> 00:18:41,408
Thank you.

135
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:17,903
- Hi.
- Hi.

136
00:19:19,655 --> 00:19:24,869
You could hurt somebody with those.
Let me show you around.

137
00:19:25,035 --> 00:19:27,496
Can you get me an interview
with Corleone?

138
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:32,751
No. I'm a relative, but I can't do that.
What else can I do for you?

139
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:36,213
- Handsome, but useless.
- Oh, yeah?

140
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,341
- That's okay, I'll gamble.
- Do you like to gamble?

141
00:19:39,508 --> 00:19:43,345
Let's go to Atlantic City.
I'll show you how to gamble.

142
00:19:43,554 --> 00:19:47,725
- How will I know what numbers to bet?
- Do I look like a loser?

143
00:19:47,892 --> 00:19:49,894
Well...

144
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,148
Spooky-looking guy there.

145
00:19:54,732 --> 00:19:59,528
- What's a guy like that doing here?
- That's Joey Zasa's bulldog.

146
00:19:59,737 --> 00:20:02,448
- You know him?
- Yeah, I do.

147
00:20:02,615 --> 00:20:07,494
His name is Anthony Squigilaro.
They call him "The Ant".

148
00:20:07,661 --> 00:20:10,748
He dips his bullets in cyanide.

149
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:21,300
Don Altobello.

150
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:26,096
<i>- I've come to pay my respects.
- Grazie.</i>

151
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:31,810
You honour my father's friendship.

152
00:20:31,977 --> 00:20:35,481
Where is my god-daughter?

153
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:38,442
- Constanza!
- Don Altobello.

154
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:43,405
It was not so long ago
that I held you in these old hands.

155
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:56,460
Michael, I've lost all the venom,
all the juice of youth.

156
00:20:56,627 --> 00:21:02,383
I've lost the lust for women,
and now my mind is clear.

157
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:09,348
My duty to God is clear.
I have a special favour to ask of you.

158
00:21:10,432 --> 00:21:17,898
Can I attach my name
to the Vito Corleone Foundation...

159
00:21:18,065 --> 00:21:23,696
...so that you and I can be joined
in name and spirit?

160
00:21:25,656 --> 00:21:30,536
- One million dollars.
- A lot of money...

161
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,334
- Godfather.
- Don Altobello, you have such a heart.

162
00:21:40,462 --> 00:21:44,633
<i>Come, let's go and sample
some of that old vino.</i>

163
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:54,685
The Vatican knows nothing
about these shareholders.

164
00:21:54,852 --> 00:21:56,228
Good.

165
00:21:56,395 --> 00:22:01,275
I have a tendency to worry. We've
increased our position substantially.

166
00:22:01,483 --> 00:22:06,780
- Naturally, I worry.
- Stop worrying, we have an agreement.

167
00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:10,993
Good. How do you think
I got this grey hair?

168
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,539
Two seconds... Thank you for your
contribution to the swimming-pool.

169
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:19,919
We need your help on Sam Wallace's
candidacy for judgeship.

170
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:22,546
- We can always use a good judge.
- Thanks.

171
00:22:22,713 --> 00:22:24,256
Andrew!

172
00:22:24,423 --> 00:22:28,594
My godson Andrew Hagen.
My brother Tom's eldest boy.

173
00:22:28,761 --> 00:22:32,806
He's been assistant to Bishop Breelan
for three years.

174
00:22:32,973 --> 00:22:37,144
- Hopes to be assigned to the Vatican.
- Rome needs fine young priests.

175
00:22:37,311 --> 00:22:40,648
His mother Theresa Hagen,
Bishop Gilday.

176
00:22:41,023 --> 00:22:42,775
Honoured to meet you.

177
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,237
Mr Corleone. Hi. Grace Hamilton.

178
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:52,034
Vincent Mancini promised to tell you
about me, that maybe you'd see me.

179
00:22:52,201 --> 00:22:55,496
- Did Vincent Mancini call about her?
- No.

180
00:22:55,663 --> 00:22:58,958
- You promised to stay out there, twice.
- I know.

181
00:23:01,126 --> 00:23:04,880
Joey Zasa showed up.
He's waiting in the lobby.

182
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:09,009
<i>He wants to personally
congratulate you. Show his respect.</i>

183
00:23:09,218 --> 00:23:14,431
<i>- Do I have to see him?
- He says you're his patron.</i>

184
00:23:17,851 --> 00:23:20,062
Hey, Vinnie!

185
00:23:20,604 --> 00:23:23,440
- Who's your favourite aunt?
- You are.

186
00:23:25,943 --> 00:23:29,530
Today I'll talk to Michael
about your little problem.

187
00:23:30,197 --> 00:23:33,951
If you'd warned me, I would have
worn a better suit.

188
00:23:34,994 --> 00:23:38,122
The Meucci Association
has elected you...

189
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:41,041
Italian-American Man of the Year.

190
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:44,712
Meucci...

191
00:23:46,922 --> 00:23:49,466
Who's Meucci?

192
00:23:49,675 --> 00:23:55,514
The Italian-American who invented
the telephone, one year before Bell.

193
00:23:59,476 --> 00:24:02,646
And this is the reason
you've come today?

194
00:24:09,904 --> 00:24:12,114
I...

195
00:24:14,158 --> 00:24:16,702
I've got a stone in my shoe.

196
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,081
A two-bit punk who works for me.

197
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:25,419
The one who thinks he's related to you.

198
00:24:27,087 --> 00:24:29,048
A bastard.

199
00:24:32,384 --> 00:24:36,972
He's here. Vincent Mancini.
He's at the party.

200
00:24:39,934 --> 00:24:42,019
Bring him in.

201
00:24:43,103 --> 00:24:46,398
I think it's good that we talk.

202
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,734
<i>No, grazie.</i>

203
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:52,780
I have a problem...

204
00:24:52,947 --> 00:24:59,203
...and I want to find out if it is
my problem or your problem.

205
00:24:59,411 --> 00:25:05,084
Your business is your business. I have
no interests or percentages from it.

206
00:25:05,709 --> 00:25:09,380
Good. Then it's my problem.

207
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:17,513
Michael, you know Vincent Mancini.
Sonny's boy.

208
00:25:19,848 --> 00:25:22,851
- How are you, Mr Corleone?
- How are you?

209
00:25:23,018 --> 00:25:26,689
- Good. How are you? Good party.
- You like it?

210
00:25:26,855 --> 00:25:30,150
- Yes, I had to sneak in.
- You're dressed for it.

211
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:39,451
So, what's the trouble
between you and Mr Joe Zasa?

212
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:45,291
- Just trouble. I'll take care of it.
- That's foolish of you.

213
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:50,963
Foolish of me? It's a little foolish
of this guy, don't you think? Right?

214
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:55,759
- Right?
- Temper like his father...

215
00:25:55,926 --> 00:25:58,220
Vincent...

216
00:25:59,263 --> 00:26:04,560
Mr Joe Zasa now owns what used to
be the Corleone business in New York.

217
00:26:04,727 --> 00:26:08,814
Out of kindness, he gave you
a job in his family.

218
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:11,817
You took it against my advice.

219
00:26:11,984 --> 00:26:16,947
I offered you something better in the
legitimate world. You turned me down.

220
00:26:17,114 --> 00:26:22,161
Now you both come to me with this bad
blood. What do you expect me to do?

221
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:26,123
- Am I a gangster?
- No...

222
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:30,628
That was Papa's neighbourhood.
Zasa runs it like a disgrace!

223
00:26:30,794 --> 00:26:34,381
- That's the past, Connie.
- I earned that territory.

224
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:38,427
The Commission gave it to me
and you approved.

225
00:26:38,594 --> 00:26:39,970
Yes.

226
00:26:40,137 --> 00:26:44,725
I came for the party, not to ask for help.
I could kill this bastard.

227
00:26:44,892 --> 00:26:47,102
So kill him.

228
00:26:47,728 --> 00:26:50,731
What does all this have to do with me?

229
00:26:50,898 --> 00:26:56,028
Well, he goes behind your back,
saying "Fuck Michael Corleone".

230
00:26:56,237 --> 00:26:58,781
Say it to his face, one time!

231
00:27:00,282 --> 00:27:05,496
Mr Corleone, all bastards are liars.
Shakespeare wrote poems about it.

232
00:27:05,663 --> 00:27:09,333
What am I going to do with this guy?

233
00:27:14,838 --> 00:27:19,552
Joey, if there's some guy
running around this city...

234
00:27:19,718 --> 00:27:22,179
...saying "Fuck Michael Corleone"...

235
00:27:23,764 --> 00:27:27,810
...what do we do
with a piece of shit like that?

236
00:27:29,228 --> 00:27:32,273
He's a fucking dog.

237
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:41,949
Yes, it's true. If anyone would say
such a thing...

238
00:27:42,157 --> 00:27:45,744
...they would not be a friend,
they would be a dog.

239
00:27:51,709 --> 00:27:57,631
- My interests don't conflict with his.
- You don't know how much they do.

240
00:27:57,798 --> 00:27:59,466
Quiet, Vincent.

241
00:27:59,633 --> 00:28:01,760
He needs your support!

242
00:28:01,927 --> 00:28:05,681
Don't let me work for this guy,
let me work for you.

243
00:28:05,848 --> 00:28:11,812
As what? Tough guy? I don't need
tough guys. I need more lawyers.

244
00:28:14,064 --> 00:28:20,321
Since we have no conflicts or debts,
I accept your tribute. I wish you well.

245
00:28:22,072 --> 00:28:26,785
Vincent, make your peace
with Mr Joe Zasa. Go on.

246
00:28:37,338 --> 00:28:39,632
<i>Bastardo...</i>

247
00:28:44,762 --> 00:28:47,640
Vinnie, what's the matter with you?

248
00:28:47,806 --> 00:28:50,100
Get him out of here.

249
00:28:51,435 --> 00:28:53,520
Jesus Christ...

250
00:28:54,563 --> 00:28:57,733
- I told Connie this wasn't the right time.
- Close it.

251
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,570
I know you're into Wall Street,
but you're still the final word.

252
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:04,657
I want to protect you from these guys.
Your lawyers can't.

253
00:29:04,823 --> 00:29:08,410
- But you can?
- Yeah, I can do that.

254
00:29:09,036 --> 00:29:11,121
Why should I be afraid of Zasa?

255
00:29:11,288 --> 00:29:14,250
You stop him from rising
in the Commission.

256
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:17,795
I say we make him dead.
Give me the order, I'll do it.

257
00:29:17,962 --> 00:29:20,047
- You'll do it?
- Yeah.

258
00:29:24,176 --> 00:29:29,139
Maybe you should come with me
for a few weeks. See what happens.

259
00:29:29,348 --> 00:29:32,434
- Okay.
- See if you learn.

260
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:36,772
And we'll talk about your future.

261
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:39,984
I won't let you down.

262
00:29:45,948 --> 00:29:48,325
It's about ready.

263
00:29:53,956 --> 00:29:55,332
What happened?

264
00:29:55,499 --> 00:29:59,336
If I'm in a room with Zasa,
what happens? I bit his ear off.

265
00:29:59,503 --> 00:30:02,506
Here we go. Watch the card.

266
00:30:04,925 --> 00:30:06,302
Hold it!

267
00:30:08,637 --> 00:30:10,431
- Vincent...
- Yeah.

268
00:30:10,598 --> 00:30:13,142
Take the picture with us.

269
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:22,443
Nice jacket.

270
00:30:23,694 --> 00:30:26,405
Closer to the centre, sir.

271
00:30:29,283 --> 00:30:31,076
Smile!

272
00:30:50,387 --> 00:30:55,601
Godfather, this is the cake for you
and your family from Enzo the baker.

273
00:30:56,227 --> 00:30:58,604
Do you want to do it?

274
00:31:44,358 --> 00:31:47,194
Cent'anni! Cent'anni!

275
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:50,299
- Vincent?
- What do you want, sweetheart?

276
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:54,637
Do you love me?

277
00:32:55,429 --> 00:32:59,808
- Come on, go to bed.
- Come on, say it.

278
00:32:59,975 --> 00:33:02,269
I love you.

279
00:33:02,436 --> 00:33:05,105
I love you, too.

280
00:33:06,815 --> 00:33:09,026
You've got a cat?

281
00:33:15,366 --> 00:33:18,619
Go get us some water, I'm thirsty.
Come on.

282
00:33:19,286 --> 00:33:21,372
Come on.

283
00:33:27,962 --> 00:33:31,340
Well, I guess I know my place.

284
00:33:31,924 --> 00:33:35,427
I can't believe I'm actually doing this.

285
00:33:35,636 --> 00:33:39,807
"Get me water, bake me a cake"...
What happened to "please"?

286
00:34:27,521 --> 00:34:30,399
Good boy, Sackface. Go for a walk.

287
00:34:38,908 --> 00:34:42,286
- Let her go.
- Cut her throat, man.

288
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,875
- What did you say?
- Cut her fucking throat.

289
00:34:50,711 --> 00:34:54,048
- Okay, chief...
- Drop your gun or he'll cut her throat.

290
00:34:54,215 --> 00:34:57,968
I hardly know her, so cut her.
What the fuck do I care?

291
00:35:00,137 --> 00:35:03,891
You've got no choice. She'll be dead.

292
00:35:04,058 --> 00:35:08,229
If you do, I'll kill you both.
Give up that knife, I'll let you go.

293
00:35:08,395 --> 00:35:10,773
Cut her throat! Right now!

294
00:35:11,899 --> 00:35:16,779
I'll do something that'll convince you.
Don't get frightened. Just watch me.

295
00:35:21,784 --> 00:35:23,369
Oh, shit!

296
00:35:25,412 --> 00:35:27,873
Drop the knife. Drop it!

297
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:34,004
Good boy. Sit down, I want to talk
to you. It was a wise choice. Sit down.

298
00:35:34,838 --> 00:35:36,924
Lose the mask.

299
00:35:39,718 --> 00:35:43,138
Relax, have a smoke. You smoke?

300
00:35:44,848 --> 00:35:47,977
Whose idea was this? Who sent you?

301
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:51,063
Tell me who sent you.

302
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,943
- No one.
- Did you take a look at this guy?

303
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,487
- Yeah.
- Who sent you?

304
00:36:01,156 --> 00:36:03,534
It was Joey Zasa.

305
00:36:17,965 --> 00:36:20,509
Are you okay?

306
00:36:22,803 --> 00:36:25,931
- You were going to let them kill me!
- No, I wasn't...

307
00:36:26,098 --> 00:36:29,435
You pig! You sick fuck!

308
00:36:30,644 --> 00:36:34,815
You wanted gambling. That's gambling.
Call the police.

309
00:36:39,236 --> 00:36:43,240
- You killed the other guy too?
- He went for my gun.

310
00:36:43,407 --> 00:36:46,994
It was self-defence.
Go ahead, call the police.

311
00:36:47,828 --> 00:36:49,914
- No, no...
- I'm taking pictures.

312
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,374
No pictures.

313
00:36:53,626 --> 00:36:55,044
<i>You had a gun!</i>

314
00:36:55,211 --> 00:37:00,257
They only had a knife. You could have
handed them over to the police.

315
00:37:00,466 --> 00:37:04,386
Zasa sent them.
I just sent him a message.

316
00:37:05,095 --> 00:37:10,309
- Now he has to send you one back.
- Is Zasa going to send me one back?

317
00:37:10,476 --> 00:37:13,354
He did the right thing.
He got Zasa's name!

318
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,734
<i>What has Joey Zasa to do
with anything? Joey Zasa is a pazzo.</i>

319
00:37:20,819 --> 00:37:23,697
All right. You are what you are.

320
00:37:24,031 --> 00:37:27,034
It's your nature. Stay close to me.

321
00:37:27,201 --> 00:37:31,038
Don't do anything. Keep your mouth
shut and your eyes open.

322
00:37:31,247 --> 00:37:34,375
- And you do what I tell you.
- I understand.

323
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:38,462
- I have problems with the Commission.
- I know.

324
00:37:38,629 --> 00:37:43,425
- You don't make them easier.
- It wasn't my idea that this happened.

325
00:37:43,592 --> 00:37:46,512
- Get out of here.
- Michael...

326
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:48,764
Yes?

327
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:54,061
<i>- Now they'll fear you.
- Maybe they should fear you.</i>

328
00:37:57,147 --> 00:38:00,901
- B.J., what's up?
- The Archbishop just called back.

329
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:04,113
We've arranged some amazing things.

330
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,243
The publicity is phenomenal. You're the
new Rockefeller. A philanthropist.

331
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:14,164
- Sign here, please.
- Times do change, don't they?

332
00:38:14,373 --> 00:38:19,587
My father hated foundations.
He loved doing it by himself.

333
00:38:20,129 --> 00:38:22,965
Man to man. But we're different.

334
00:38:23,132 --> 00:38:28,012
No different than any large corporation.
We control a lot of money with little.

335
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:33,017
Minimise taxes.
With no government control.

336
00:38:41,775 --> 00:38:45,196
- Godfather.
- Andrew.

337
00:38:46,864 --> 00:38:51,493
- Off to Rome...
- I wanted to thank you for everything.

338
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,788
- Do you want some breakfast?
- Thanks, I can't.

339
00:38:54,955 --> 00:38:58,959
<i>- How's your Italian?
- Devo fare un po' di pratica.</i>

340
00:39:00,169 --> 00:39:02,546
- His father was a great lawyer.
- I know.

341
00:39:02,713 --> 00:39:07,384
Didn't live to see him ordained. I did.
Did you ever see one of those?

342
00:39:07,551 --> 00:39:11,138
Beautiful. I was so proud.
Let me walk you out.

343
00:39:12,306 --> 00:39:15,434
If you hear any rumours in the Vatican,
let me know.

344
00:39:15,601 --> 00:39:18,437
No, Andrew has the true faith.

345
00:39:27,363 --> 00:39:29,240
<i>Don Corleone...</i>

346
00:39:29,406 --> 00:39:33,994
I need your help. And not just
to light a little candle.

347
00:39:35,204 --> 00:39:42,211
My gift was to be able to persuade
people to give to the Holy Church.

348
00:39:42,962 --> 00:39:47,925
Then Rome decides to put me
in charge of the Vatican Bank...

349
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,846
...but I was never a true banker.

350
00:39:55,683 --> 00:40:00,187
<i>Mea culpa. I trusted my friends.</i>

351
00:40:01,188 --> 00:40:03,566
Friendship and money...

352
00:40:04,441 --> 00:40:06,235
Oil and water...

353
00:40:06,402 --> 00:40:08,070
Indeed.

354
00:40:08,237 --> 00:40:15,244
But these "friends" used the good name
of the Church to feed their greed.

355
00:40:16,245 --> 00:40:18,914
If money was lost...

356
00:40:19,957 --> 00:40:22,626
...then I am to blame.

357
00:40:23,252 --> 00:40:29,133
If only prayer could pay off
our 700 million dollar deficit.

358
00:40:30,801 --> 00:40:33,554
769 million...

359
00:40:39,143 --> 00:40:44,356
The Church owns 25 percent
of a large corporation: Immobiliare.

360
00:40:45,232 --> 00:40:47,318
You know the one I mean?

361
00:40:47,484 --> 00:40:52,698
Largest landlord on Earth.
Real estate worth six billion dollars.

362
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,452
That's true.

363
00:40:56,619 --> 00:41:00,789
And the Vatican vote
is necessary for control.

364
00:41:03,292 --> 00:41:06,337
No, you're mistaken.

365
00:41:06,503 --> 00:41:10,883
This isn't a question of one person
deciding, one deciding vote.

366
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:17,014
This is like any other company.
We have directors and very old rules.

367
00:41:17,806 --> 00:41:22,686
The Pope himself
would have to approve you.

368
00:41:26,732 --> 00:41:29,026
We've sold the casinos.

369
00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:34,490
All businesses having to do
with gambling.

370
00:41:34,698 --> 00:41:40,496
We have no interests or investments
in anything illegitimate.

371
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:48,170
The Corleones are prepared to deposit
500 million dollars in the Vatican Bank...

372
00:41:48,379 --> 00:41:51,507
...when Mr Corleone receives
majority control of Immobiliare.

373
00:41:51,674 --> 00:41:57,221
Immobiliare could be something new.
A European conglomerate.

374
00:41:58,264 --> 00:42:02,601
Few families have control
of such a company.

375
00:42:05,688 --> 00:42:08,566
It seems that, in today's world...

376
00:42:08,732 --> 00:42:13,946
...the power to absolve debt is greater
than the power of forgiveness.

377
00:42:15,155 --> 00:42:17,283
600 million dollars.

378
00:42:22,121 --> 00:42:25,958
Don't overestimate
the power of forgiveness.

379
00:42:27,418 --> 00:42:29,420
Don Corleone...

380
00:42:29,587 --> 00:42:34,633
...this deal with Immobiliare can make you
one of the richest men in the world.

381
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,347
Your whole past history, and the history
of your family, would be washed away.

382
00:42:44,184 --> 00:42:46,729
600 million.

383
00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:06,832
<i>The motion under discussion
relates to Corleone Group's proposal...</i>

384
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:12,671
<i>...to acquire 100,000,000 newly-issued
Class A voting shares.</i>

385
00:43:14,256 --> 00:43:21,013
<i>...Corleone capital invested directly
into International Immobiliare...</i>

386
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:25,100
<i>...an old and respected
European company.</i>

387
00:43:25,267 --> 00:43:30,648
Mr Corleone has an ambitious programme
to expand this real estate company...

388
00:43:30,814 --> 00:43:33,817
...into an international conglomerate...

389
00:43:37,279 --> 00:43:42,243
...by Eastern techniques of efficiency
and focus and unlimited...

390
00:43:42,451 --> 00:43:45,454
Mr Corleone, excuse me.

391
00:43:45,621 --> 00:43:49,291
Didn't you recently deposit 200 million
in the Vatican Bank...

392
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:52,419
...which is affiliated with Immobiliare?

393
00:43:52,586 --> 00:43:54,129
True. Why not?

394
00:43:54,296 --> 00:43:59,760
Wasn't there any questioning about
the timing on this particular deposit?

395
00:44:00,511 --> 00:44:03,055
Mr Chairman, if I may?

396
00:44:04,431 --> 00:44:09,103
The Vito Andolini Corleone Foundation,
of which Mary Corleone is chairman...

397
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:12,606
...has made an endowment
of 100 million dollars.

398
00:44:12,773 --> 00:44:17,027
The money comes from his own family
and will be administered by the Vatican.

399
00:44:17,194 --> 00:44:19,822
Does that answer your question?

400
00:44:19,989 --> 00:44:26,328
I have always believed that helping your
fellow man is profitable in every sense...

401
00:44:26,537 --> 00:44:29,081
...personally and bottom line.

402
00:44:29,373 --> 00:44:35,045
My fellow shareholders, if Europe
and America can learn to co-operate...

403
00:44:35,212 --> 00:44:39,258
...if we can learn to pool our wealth,
share our markets...

404
00:44:39,425 --> 00:44:44,471
...we can defeat any competition
anywhere in the world.

405
00:44:45,055 --> 00:44:47,766
Thank you for your time.

406
00:44:47,933 --> 00:44:52,563
I hope that you will look favourably
on my proposal. Thank you.

407
00:44:58,152 --> 00:45:01,155
Let me have this microphone here.

408
00:45:01,322 --> 00:45:06,660
Will we let a criminal run our company?
He's got the map of Sicily on his face!

409
00:45:06,827 --> 00:45:08,370
Order!

410
00:45:08,537 --> 00:45:11,582
He's either a Catholic or a mafioso...

411
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:17,963
The Hamilton Investors Group
cannot support this proposal.

412
00:45:18,547 --> 00:45:19,924
Your Excellency...

413
00:45:21,008 --> 00:45:22,551
Mr Chairman...

414
00:45:23,344 --> 00:45:29,600
...the Vatican Bank feels
that International Immobiliare...

415
00:45:31,518 --> 00:45:35,648
...will be safe in Mr Corleone's hands.

416
00:45:35,814 --> 00:45:40,778
...subject to audit and final ratification,
which must take place in Rome.

417
00:45:40,986 --> 00:45:44,907
Please join me in welcoming
Mr Michael Corleone.

418
00:45:54,917 --> 00:45:56,752
Dad?

419
00:45:59,004 --> 00:46:02,758
Tony says that I'm a front
for the foundation.

420
00:46:03,968 --> 00:46:07,721
That you're using me to pull the strings.

421
00:46:07,888 --> 00:46:11,016
- To get the money where you want it.
- Please!

422
00:46:11,183 --> 00:46:14,353
- To shine up your public image.
- Mary!

423
00:46:15,104 --> 00:46:19,275
Mary, this is real.
This foundation is real.

424
00:46:21,694 --> 00:46:26,740
I wanted Anthony to be part of it.
I thought you would be together on this.

425
00:46:26,907 --> 00:46:31,287
I won't interfere.
I'll help, but only if you ask.

426
00:46:31,453 --> 00:46:34,123
What is this really for?

427
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:39,086
Why are you doing this?
Why am I doing this?

428
00:46:39,295 --> 00:46:44,425
I'm doing this for my children.
You're doing it for your children too.

429
00:46:44,842 --> 00:46:48,053
This foundation is supposed to
help all people?

430
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,763
That's the purpose.

431
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:55,436
This is legitimate.
Mary, I swear, this is legitimate.

432
00:46:59,481 --> 00:47:02,985
Dad, I want this to bring me
closer to you.

433
00:47:10,701 --> 00:47:15,122
I would burn in Hell to keep you safe.

434
00:47:28,802 --> 00:47:31,722
Go in the other car. I'll ride with Michael.

435
00:47:31,889 --> 00:47:33,974
Go, go, go.

436
00:47:47,613 --> 00:47:53,661
As your family's oldest friend, I'm
always chosen to bring you messages.

437
00:47:55,871 --> 00:47:58,999
Tell me, Don Altobello.

438
00:48:00,584 --> 00:48:04,755
Your old partners are grateful for
the money you made them.

439
00:48:04,922 --> 00:48:07,299
They worship you...

440
00:48:08,342 --> 00:48:14,431
...but their hearts are broken, because
they think you abandoned them.

441
00:48:14,932 --> 00:48:21,105
They want to share your deal
on Immobiliare, to be a family again.

442
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,191
It can purify their money.

443
00:48:26,235 --> 00:48:28,779
This I cannot do.

444
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:34,577
Immobiliare must be legitimate.

445
00:48:35,786 --> 00:48:38,330
I know.

446
00:48:38,497 --> 00:48:41,125
But they're unhappy.

447
00:48:42,668 --> 00:48:44,587
And you?

448
00:48:44,753 --> 00:48:50,843
I ask nothing for myself,
only peace in my old age.

449
00:48:51,051 --> 00:48:54,722
But I must please the world around me.

450
00:48:55,931 --> 00:49:02,438
Michael, your father was a
reasonable man. Learn from him.

451
00:49:04,523 --> 00:49:08,110
I learned many things from my father.

452
00:49:13,324 --> 00:49:19,079
Call a meeting, my friend,
so there are no debts or grudges.

453
00:49:20,331 --> 00:49:23,542
We will make the peace, you and I.

454
00:49:31,467 --> 00:49:33,510
<i>The Vatican announced today...</i>

455
00:49:33,677 --> 00:49:37,973
<i>...that Pope Paul VI has canceled
his Sunday blessing...</i>

456
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,351
<i>...due to ill health.</i>

457
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:46,273
<i>His physician has ordered
total bedrest...</i>

458
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,318
<i>...and cessation of all activities.</i>

459
00:50:02,998 --> 00:50:08,587
<i>They've had a press conference. The
Pope's condition is grave. "Gravissimo. "</i>

460
00:50:35,531 --> 00:50:40,828
The purpose of this meeting
is to ratify...

461
00:50:40,995 --> 00:50:45,082
...the motion passed by our
shareholders in New York.

462
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:47,960
Please...

463
00:50:48,127 --> 00:50:52,798
Our group represents a consortium
of Catholic businessmen...

464
00:50:52,965 --> 00:50:56,093
...against the Corleone control.

465
00:50:56,552 --> 00:51:01,599
The Vatican has cast its vote. Corleone
Group already controls the Board.

466
00:51:01,891 --> 00:51:06,604
According to the Lateran Treaty,
the Vatican vote must be ratified here.

467
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:09,440
Here in Rome, by the Pope.

468
00:51:12,902 --> 00:51:16,488
The Pope is gravely ill.

469
00:51:17,448 --> 00:51:21,702
Until he recovers, I am powerless.

470
00:51:22,244 --> 00:51:25,247
- What if he dies?
- Then...

471
00:51:26,207 --> 00:51:29,460
...as you Americans say,
all bets are off.

472
00:51:29,627 --> 00:51:32,296
Gentlemen, please.

473
00:51:33,047 --> 00:51:37,343
This is a brief delay. Nothing more.

474
00:51:41,347 --> 00:51:44,725
Your Excellency, gentlemen...

475
00:51:45,142 --> 00:51:50,856
I advise you to join us in our prayers
for the Holy Father's recovery.

476
00:51:51,941 --> 00:51:53,692
We had an agreement!

477
00:51:54,985 --> 00:51:58,822
This meeting was to be
merely a formality.

478
00:51:59,031 --> 00:52:04,161
- Please sit down.
- I'd rather stand. Give me an answer.

479
00:52:04,328 --> 00:52:09,833
The Immobiliare has its roots in the
European tradition. Please understand.

480
00:52:10,501 --> 00:52:13,921
I understand.
Your tactics are despicable.

481
00:52:14,129 --> 00:52:17,258
That's quite an indictment,
coming from a Corleone.

482
00:52:17,424 --> 00:52:22,638
- Gentlemen, gentlemen!
- Remember you are in the Vatican.

483
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:31,438
- What is it that you want?
- Yes, you will take control.

484
00:52:32,106 --> 00:52:36,193
We'll gladly put you at the helm
of our little fleet...

485
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:40,447
...but our ships must all sail
in the same direction.

486
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:47,913
Otherwise, who can say how long
your stay with us will last?

487
00:52:49,623 --> 00:52:56,130
It's not personal. It's only business.
You should know, Godfather.

488
00:52:59,508 --> 00:53:01,010
Very well.

489
00:53:02,177 --> 00:53:07,224
You want to do business with me?
I will do business with you.

490
00:53:08,225 --> 00:53:10,936
Vipers, all of them.

491
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:19,320
- We're back with the Borgias!
- Uncle Michael...

492
00:53:19,486 --> 00:53:22,489
- Andrew!
- I heard you were here.

493
00:53:22,656 --> 00:53:27,077
It's so nice to see you.
Vincent, it's so nice.

494
00:53:27,244 --> 00:53:30,414
What is this about the Borgias?
Those days are over.

495
00:53:35,961 --> 00:53:38,881
- Recognise it?
- Yeah.

496
00:53:39,673 --> 00:53:44,553
Genco Olive Oil. That's where our
grandfather started as a delivery boy.

497
00:53:44,762 --> 00:53:47,681
Three years later he owned it.

498
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:51,268
- Only in America.
- That's it.

499
00:53:51,435 --> 00:53:56,649
Vincenzo, where have you been hiding?
We need your help so badly.

500
00:53:56,815 --> 00:54:00,986
- What can I do for you?
- Get rid of Joe Zasa. He sells drugs...

501
00:54:01,153 --> 00:54:05,658
Now that I'm an older woman,
I'm afraid to go out at night.

502
00:54:05,824 --> 00:54:08,035
Where should they be now?

503
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:11,372
- Lou, what's going on?
- We're late.

504
00:54:13,207 --> 00:54:15,751
- Have I ever let you down?
- I trust you.

505
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,337
- Don't worry.
- Thank you.

506
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:20,339
Enjoy yourselves.

507
00:54:26,762 --> 00:54:31,267
- What was that?
- The neighbourhood's in trouble.

508
00:54:31,684 --> 00:54:34,436
- Do you keep an eye out for them?
- Yes.

509
00:54:34,603 --> 00:54:37,606
- And for me?
- From now on.

510
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:42,444
- I've missed you all this time.
- I missed you too, cousin.

511
00:54:42,611 --> 00:54:47,825
I missed growing up with my cousins.
I didn't even know you, but missed you.

512
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:52,955
Do you remember stories
about our fathers? The old days?

513
00:54:53,122 --> 00:54:56,250
Yeah, what do you want to know?

514
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:03,799
- What was Sonny like?
- Well, he was the Prince of the City.

515
00:55:04,758 --> 00:55:08,679
He died before I was born,
but I've heard a lot about him.

516
00:55:10,222 --> 00:55:13,976
- What about my father?
- He's a great man.

517
00:55:15,269 --> 00:55:18,105
He's a hero. He saved the family.

518
00:55:19,356 --> 00:55:21,442
- Vincent?
- What?

519
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:24,153
Did he kill his own brother?

520
00:55:28,282 --> 00:55:30,201
No.

521
00:55:32,161 --> 00:55:34,705
So, it's all lies?

522
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:41,629
Just stories, sweetheart. Okay?

523
00:55:45,382 --> 00:55:47,176
Okay.

524
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:50,804
I believe you.

525
00:55:51,013 --> 00:55:55,100
- I'm glad you're around.
- I'm glad you're here too.

526
00:55:59,605 --> 00:56:01,649
<i>Cugina...</i>

527
00:56:01,857 --> 00:56:03,943
Cous...

528
00:56:17,748 --> 00:56:21,126
I'd like to take Joey Zasa for a ride
in this and drop him.

529
00:56:21,293 --> 00:56:24,046
Joey Zasa is nothing.

530
00:56:24,213 --> 00:56:28,050
He's a small-time enforcer.
He bluffs and threatens.

531
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:32,263
He's nothing. You can see him coming
a mile away.

532
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:36,058
- We should kill him before he...
- No!

533
00:56:38,602 --> 00:56:43,399
Never hate your enemies.
It affects your judgement.

534
00:56:59,081 --> 00:57:01,792
Nice to see you again, Mr Corleone.

535
00:57:22,271 --> 00:57:25,024
Hey, girls. Let's go.

536
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:46,670
We trusted you to manage
our money in the casinos.

537
00:57:46,837 --> 00:57:52,676
It's not even 20 years. You've sold the
casinos and made fortunes for all of us.

538
00:57:52,843 --> 00:57:55,221
Bravo, Don Corleone!

539
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,432
Thank you.

540
00:57:59,391 --> 00:58:06,690
Friends, I have come here
because our business together is done.

541
00:58:07,816 --> 00:58:09,610
We have prospered...

542
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:15,741
...and now it is time for us to dissolve
the business relationship between us.

543
00:58:17,034 --> 00:58:19,078
That's it.

544
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:22,748
But I do have a little surprise. Al?

545
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:27,753
Your shares in the casinos.

546
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:32,091
I've cut the red tape, so you could
get your money right away.

547
00:58:38,722 --> 00:58:41,016
50 million dollars!

548
00:58:41,225 --> 00:58:44,645
- Not everybody gets the same.
- Nothing for you...

549
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:50,734
- It depends on your investment.
- Michael, this is really generous!

550
00:58:50,901 --> 00:58:52,278
Wonderful!

551
00:58:55,281 --> 00:59:00,619
- Parisi, how much did you invest?
- I don't remember.

552
00:59:00,786 --> 00:59:02,830
You're blessed.

553
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:12,840
My family has done much of
the hard work, taken many risks.

554
00:59:14,466 --> 00:59:17,511
All to make money
for the rest of the families.

555
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:22,474
You all know Joey Zasa.

556
00:59:22,808 --> 00:59:25,936
He is, I admit, an important man.

557
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:30,774
His picture is on the cover
of the New York Times magazine.

558
00:59:30,941 --> 00:59:35,738
He gets the Esquire Magazine award
for the best-dressed gangster.

559
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,865
The newspapers praise him...

560
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:42,578
...because he hires Blacks,
which shows he has a good heart.

561
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:47,458
He is famous.

562
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:53,672
Who knows? Maybe one day
he'll make all of you popular.

563
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:56,717
It's true.

564
00:59:56,884 --> 01:00:02,348
<i>I make more of a bella figura.
That is my nature.</i>

565
01:00:02,514 --> 01:00:07,394
But I also want to make a move
into legitimate enterprises.

566
01:00:07,603 --> 01:00:10,314
I'd like a little pin from the Pope.

567
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:15,819
Sure, I take the Blacks and the Spanish
into my family...

568
01:00:16,028 --> 01:00:19,323
...because that's America.

569
01:00:20,032 --> 01:00:24,203
And you guarantee
that they don't deal drugs?

570
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:30,543
I don't guarantee that. I guarantee
that I'll kill anybody who does.

571
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:39,593
- Let me talk to him.
- Who can refuse Don Altobello?

572
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:42,972
- Joey, are you...
- No!

573
01:00:43,138 --> 01:00:48,894
I say to all of you: I have been
treated this day with no respect.

574
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:54,984
I've earned you all money. I've made
you rich and I asked for little.

575
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:59,697
Good. You will not give, so I'll take!

576
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:03,117
As for Don Corleone...

577
01:01:03,325 --> 01:01:09,415
...he makes it very clear to me today
that he is my enemy.

578
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,880
You must choose between us.

579
01:01:19,925 --> 01:01:21,594
No, Joey!

580
01:01:22,678 --> 01:01:25,681
Michael, we could reason together.

581
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,433
No.

582
01:01:28,642 --> 01:01:33,022
Michael, please... Let's agree.

583
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,566
He doesn't know what he's...

584
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:37,651
No, no.

585
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:45,242
Michael, the news is everywhere.

586
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:49,705
Everyone says that you
control Immobiliare.

587
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:55,461
Immobiliare is already laundering
money in Peru and Nassau.

588
01:01:56,378 --> 01:02:01,133
We've worked with you for 40 years.
We should wet our beaks a little.

589
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:06,513
- We want to do business with you.
- That's right, we've been together...

590
01:02:15,689 --> 01:02:19,109
- It's a hit! Let's go!
- Let's get out of here! Move!

591
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:41,173
My coat! It's my lucky coat!

592
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:44,301
It's my lucky coat!

593
01:02:50,182 --> 01:02:52,726
Stay behind me!

594
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:09,702
Mikey, this way!

595
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:21,338
Zasa, you son-of-a-bitch...

596
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,653
Come on. We're out of here.

597
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:18,979
<i>- You did good, Vincent.
- Grazie.</i>

598
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:22,608
The old Dons were pretty much
wiped out.

599
01:04:22,816 --> 01:04:25,778
The survivors made deals with Zasa.

600
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,406
- Altobello?
- He survived.

601
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:34,912
He's with his daughters in Staten Island.
He says he's going to retire in Sicily.

602
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:41,418
Joey Zasa would never pull something
like this without the backing.

603
01:04:41,585 --> 01:04:47,299
He's just muscle. He doesn't have
the wit for that helicopter attack.

604
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:51,845
He doesn't even have the ambition
to wipe out the whole Commission.

605
01:04:52,012 --> 01:04:54,932
I say we hit back and take Zasa out!

606
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:03,399
Never let anyone know
what you're thinking.

607
01:05:11,323 --> 01:05:14,451
Let's get a message to Joey Zasa.

608
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:20,416
I respect what he's done.

609
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:24,169
The new overthrows the old. It's natural.

610
01:05:24,336 --> 01:05:28,090
How can you do business
with this guy?

611
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:33,470
I'm a businessman, first and foremost.
I want no further conflict.

612
01:05:33,637 --> 01:05:38,601
- Tell him that he can live or he can die.
- Vincent, will you shut up!

613
01:05:56,493 --> 01:05:58,579
That's it.

614
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:02,249
Joey Zasa...

615
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:05,211
He can't be doing this alone.

616
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:13,427
Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

617
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:26,982
Our true enemy has not yet
shown his face.

618
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,113
Michael!

619
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:43,791
- Has he had his medicine?
- I don't know what he took.

620
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:50,047
- I've got my wind back.
- Call a doctor.

621
01:06:50,214 --> 01:06:53,092
- Run, run, run!
- Vincent!

622
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:55,386
Run at thunder, girl! Thunder can't hurt!

623
01:06:57,137 --> 01:06:59,682
Harmless noise!

624
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:04,603
Bullshit! You deceitful old fuck!

625
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:07,815
Altobello, you fuck!

626
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,736
Fredo!

627
01:07:13,153 --> 01:07:14,655
Fredo!

628
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:41,223
Oh, God! Dad!

629
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:45,436
Excuse me.

630
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:47,688
I'll call Kay.

631
01:07:57,865 --> 01:08:02,036
- Good evening, sir.
- Can we wait here? We'll be back soon.

632
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:14,924
Mr Harrison, you said it was urgent.
Have you come to confess your sins?

633
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:20,262
Michael Corleone has had a diabetic
stroke. I wanted you to know about it.

634
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:25,226
He's in a coma. I'm here to insist
the deal goes through in any event.

635
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:27,561
The Pope has not much time left.

636
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:33,108
So, as you, I am in a difficult position.

637
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:37,279
We have to ratify this deal
as soon as possible.

638
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:40,574
- We have an understanding.
- Good.

639
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:45,704
- I'm going to the hospital.
- I'll pray for Mr Corleone.

640
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:54,046
- Our thoughts are with Mr Corleone.
- Thank you, Father Jim.

641
01:08:56,423 --> 01:09:00,845
Everything would be out in the open
if Corleone dies.

642
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:03,722
Play for time, Keinszig.

643
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:09,311
A habit born of a long contemplation
of eternity.

644
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:19,780
- Forget about it, Vinnie.
- Why? It's a simple hit.

645
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:25,870
I'd love to smack Joey Zasa and then
whack the fag. But it's impossible.

646
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:31,500
He's always with people, in front of TV
cameras in his own neighbourhood.

647
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:35,170
- It's not impossible. It'll work for us.
- How?

648
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:40,259
Do you think he's going to let
Uncle Michael survive? Would you?

649
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:43,345
He may not survive anyway.

650
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:47,683
- How would you do it?
- I'd do it myself.

651
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:51,395
Do it!

652
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:56,025
- What would you need?
- A couple of guys.

653
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:29,141
Hello, Michael.

654
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:33,604
It's Kay.

655
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:39,777
Kay...

656
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:44,281
I never expected you.

657
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:46,992
No, I know.

658
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:51,205
But I'm here.

659
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:57,461
- I'm glad.
- You know...

660
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:03,092
I've never seen you looking so helpless.

661
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:10,224
It's not so bad, really.

662
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:16,063
I feel... I'm getting wiser now.

663
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:18,607
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

664
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:25,197
- The sicker you get, the wiser you get?
- When I'm dead, I'll be really smart.

665
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:31,120
Michael... I want to thank you for Tony.

666
01:11:33,914 --> 01:11:38,294
He's doing really well.
He's gotten some very good notices...

667
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:44,174
...and he'll make his operatic debut
in Sicily, in Palermo this Easter, so...

668
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,303
So, thank you.

669
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:52,099
That's a real honour. In Sicily.

670
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:59,982
I will be there. I won't miss that.

671
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:02,484
I won't miss that.

672
01:12:08,532 --> 01:12:11,076
Mary, Tony...

673
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:14,663
Go see Dad.

674
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:23,297
- Sweetheart!
- Everything's going to be all right.

675
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:26,967
- Tony!
- How are you doing, Pop?

676
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:32,348
Your mother told me what happened.

677
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:38,437
- About Palermo? I hope you'll be there.
- Of course. Kiss me.

678
01:12:57,873 --> 01:13:03,629
<i>- Cousin Vinnie?
- He's not here. Call his apartment.</i>

679
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:07,383
- It's your cousin Mary.
- Let her in.

680
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:15,432
Hi, cous. I thought I'd drop by.
Is that okay?

681
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:18,269
I'll get the guys.

682
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:22,940
No, it's not okay.
You shouldn't have come, Mary.

683
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:26,485
Only a couple of minutes, okay?

684
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:31,240
- You look beautiful, cous.
- Thanks.

685
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:37,121
So this is your club, your hideout?

686
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:40,541
- Yeah.
- I came here to check it out.

687
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:48,966
It's so strange, just me
and Aunt Connie in the house.

688
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:53,804
- I feel better when I'm with you.
- What's wrong, sweetheart?

689
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:56,682
- I'm scared about my father.
- Don't be.

690
01:13:56,849 --> 01:14:01,353
When they took him out of
the ambulance, I thought he was dead.

691
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,648
Everybody says he's going to be better.

692
01:14:05,482 --> 01:14:07,568
Don't worry.

693
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:10,613
I remember a shooting when I was little.

694
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:16,744
And one time Al Neri and other
bodyguards took me and Tony away.

695
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:21,415
Is it all happening again?

696
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:24,501
Not like that, sweetie.

697
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:30,424
Then why are you hiding here?
Is something going to happen to you?

698
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:36,222
<i>Nothing's going to happen
to me, cugina. We'll take care of you.</i>

699
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:51,195
- Can I stay here and hide out with you?
- Can you help me cook for the boys?

700
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:55,533
You know that I don't know
how to cook, but I'll help.

701
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,005
Okay...

702
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:12,258
What do I do?

703
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:47,668
- I love you, cous.
- I love you, too, cous.

704
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:53,299
Let us cook.

705
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:11,442
Hold me.

706
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:52,274
You in the press and the police
use words like "Mafia", "Cosa Nostra".

707
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:57,905
This is a fantasy. We Italian-Americans
laid the bricks that built this city.

708
01:16:58,072 --> 01:17:00,616
We have Meucci,
who invented the telephone.

709
01:17:00,824 --> 01:17:04,495
We have Don Ameche,
who played the guy who invented it.

710
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:08,749
Buy yourself a raffle ticket,
maybe you'll win a Cadillac.

711
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:12,503
The salsiccia is wonderful!

712
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:14,922
Here, have a sandwich.

713
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:31,689
- Nice to see you, Mr Zasa.
- Have a nice time.

714
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:35,776
Don't forget to buy your raffle tickets.

715
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:41,532
- What are you doing?
- He didn't mean it.

716
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:45,119
- Tell him you're sorry.
- Okay, let's go.

717
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:05,973
Joey! How are you?

718
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:09,602
How are you, Buddy boy?

719
01:18:09,768 --> 01:18:13,522
Hey, Joey Zasa! Joey, up your ass!

720
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:17,610
- Who is this? Do you know him?
- Ignore him.

721
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:21,530
Who's going to win the car? The Ant?

722
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:27,536
<i>This is what gives Italian-Americans
a bad name. A cappone like this.</i>

723
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,997
Joey, up your ass!

724
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:33,125
Get off the car!
Do you have a raffle ticket?

725
01:18:33,918 --> 01:18:37,254
Joey, take a look at my raffle ticket!

726
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:41,759
Here's what I think of you...
and your raffle ticket.

727
01:18:41,926 --> 01:18:45,596
Get the fuck off this car.
I'll break your fucking balls.

728
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:50,893
Get out of here!

729
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:09,703
Run, Joey! You piece of shit!

730
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:22,967
Open the door!

731
01:19:23,551 --> 01:19:26,428
How are you, Joe?

732
01:19:28,639 --> 01:19:30,015
Zasa!

733
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:54,498
Don't ever again give that kind of order.
Not while I'm alive.

734
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:56,750
Understand?

735
01:19:57,918 --> 01:20:04,091
You were too sick to make a decision.
I got a go-ahead from Neri and Connie.

736
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:06,802
Connie?

737
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:19,356
It was the right decision, Uncle Mike.

738
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:23,277
It was the wrong decision.
I command this family!

739
01:20:23,903 --> 01:20:26,030
Right or wrong...

740
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:29,783
...it was not what I wanted!

741
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:50,095
Do you understand?

742
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:58,062
Yes.

743
01:21:04,777 --> 01:21:06,529
Come on, Michael.

744
01:21:18,165 --> 01:21:20,084
Yes.

745
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:27,591
Good. Vincent, help me to my bed.
I want to talk to you alone for a minute.

746
01:21:35,683 --> 01:21:40,479
You know, I always felt
responsible for you.

747
01:21:40,646 --> 01:21:42,773
You know that.

748
01:21:43,107 --> 01:21:44,942
Your father...

749
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:49,321
...my brother, we were opposites.

750
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:54,535
We would fight and argue.
But I never doubted his love.

751
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:59,540
He would do anything for me.
But his temper...

752
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:07,173
Too much. It clouded his reason.

753
01:22:08,299 --> 01:22:11,677
I don't want you to make that mistake.

754
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:16,098
Also...

755
01:22:16,307 --> 01:22:19,435
...he, too, had a way with women.

756
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:23,230
- Vincent...
- So I hear.

757
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:25,900
What are you doing with my daughter?

758
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:31,655
What are you doing with her?

759
01:22:35,326 --> 01:22:37,620
It's too dangerous.

760
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:42,333
Do you hear me?

761
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:50,049
Okay.

762
01:23:03,771 --> 01:23:05,981
Vincenzo...

763
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:14,365
When they come,
they'll come at what you love.

764
01:23:21,872 --> 01:23:25,167
Michael, you must lead another life.

765
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:30,798
You have everything a man could
desire. It's time for you to retire.

766
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:34,468
I have too much responsibility.

767
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:40,808
Immobiliare? It's too difficult now.
You should really get out.

768
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:46,063
<i>What do you know
about those pezzi da novanta in Italy?</i>

769
01:23:49,608 --> 01:23:53,445
I'm too old to know anything
about those new people.

770
01:23:53,654 --> 01:23:58,409
I must accept my age
and grow my olives and tomatoes.

771
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:03,873
- We're not that old.
- But you're very ill.

772
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:09,169
Michael... Let me see
what can be done.

773
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:13,757
Let me work to make your path
a little easier.

774
01:24:13,924 --> 01:24:19,513
- Your friendship does that always.
- That makes me happy.

775
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:23,851
Joey Zasa... You were wrong
about him.

776
01:24:24,852 --> 01:24:28,772
I trust too much.
That's always been my fault.

777
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:40,326
Michael... Treachery is everywhere.

778
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:44,914
You still have your fingers
on the strings, even now.

779
01:24:45,873 --> 01:24:49,001
Let's see more of each other.

780
01:24:49,168 --> 01:24:53,756
- Michael, in Sicily?
- In Sicily.

781
01:24:54,298 --> 01:24:56,383
<i>In Sicilia.</i>

782
01:24:56,634 --> 01:24:59,261
<i>In Sicilia.</i>

783
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:48,519
How are you?

784
01:25:48,686 --> 01:25:51,230
Don Bendino, my old friend.

785
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:28,559
I brought you here so that my old friend
and protector, Don Tommasino...

786
01:26:28,726 --> 01:26:30,811
...could advise us.

787
01:26:30,978 --> 01:26:35,024
What do you think about Altobello?

788
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:39,195
A very talented man.

789
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:44,116
He has kept the peace between our
Sicilian and American friends.

790
01:26:44,283 --> 01:26:46,952
The saint of reason.

791
01:26:48,746 --> 01:26:52,750
A blood-bath in Atlantic City
left New York a mess.

792
01:26:52,917 --> 01:26:56,045
Joey Zasa at least was running
a tight ship...

793
01:26:56,212 --> 01:27:00,132
...but with him out of the picture
we must step in.

794
01:27:00,299 --> 01:27:04,803
- Step back in...
- Or the Chinese and Colombians will.

795
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:10,559
The Corleones left drugs, so New York
is weak, and Palermo is strong.

796
01:27:11,477 --> 01:27:15,648
Your enemies always get strong
on what you leave behind.

797
01:27:16,232 --> 01:27:22,655
Who could give the order
for that massacre...

798
01:27:24,949 --> 01:27:28,786
...and still pressure the Vatican deal?

799
01:27:28,953 --> 01:27:33,916
Only Lucchesi can reach
between these two worlds.

800
01:27:35,834 --> 01:27:39,880
"Our ships must all sail
in the same direction"...

801
01:27:41,048 --> 01:27:46,804
Italian politics have had these men
for centuries. They are the true Mafia.

802
01:27:46,971 --> 01:27:50,266
The Archbishop and the Vatican Bank,
that's the big problem.

803
01:27:50,432 --> 01:27:54,728
They're the same problem.
B.J., they're connected.

804
01:27:55,271 --> 01:27:57,898
The Archbishop has powerful friends.

805
01:28:00,568 --> 01:28:02,570
They totally protect him.

806
01:28:02,736 --> 01:28:07,157
Is there someone in the
Church we can turn to?

807
01:28:07,324 --> 01:28:11,078
Someone we can tell
our problem to?

808
01:28:12,162 --> 01:28:14,248
Cardinal Lamberto.

809
01:28:14,415 --> 01:28:19,837
A wise and good man...
very influential.

810
01:28:20,004 --> 01:28:23,007
He will see you.

811
01:28:28,012 --> 01:28:33,893
I will see this Cardinal Lamberto
and see if we can work things out.

812
01:28:35,561 --> 01:28:40,441
You honour your agreements,
but you are dealing with crooks.

813
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:43,485
They have no honour.

814
01:28:45,279 --> 01:28:47,114
My word is final.

815
01:28:57,750 --> 01:29:01,670
Politics and crime,
they're the same thing.

816
01:29:24,235 --> 01:29:30,908
I've invited you all here to celebrate
my son's debut in an opera house...

817
01:29:31,075 --> 01:29:34,203
We'll play "Philadelphia".

818
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:38,791
Seven cards. Two down, four up.
Deuces and one-eyed jacks are wild.

819
01:29:38,958 --> 01:29:41,627
...in the opera "Cavallaria Rusticana".

820
01:29:41,794 --> 01:29:45,548
- It's "Cavalleria Rusticana", Dad.
- "Cavalleria".

821
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:50,928
I think I have tickets to the wrong opera.
I've been in New York too long.

822
01:29:51,804 --> 01:29:55,224
You will all receive tickets,
so come on time.

823
01:29:55,432 --> 01:29:58,561
Dad, I've got a present for you.

824
01:30:01,355 --> 01:30:05,985
It comes from the town of Corleone
and it's authentic Sicilian.

825
01:30:07,027 --> 01:30:10,447
And... I learned it for you.

826
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:45,376
<i>She was wonderful, beautiful.
I loved her. And then she died.</i>

827
01:31:46,502 --> 01:31:51,715
My trusted bodyguard
planted a bomb in my car.

828
01:31:53,175 --> 01:31:56,220
She drove it before I did.

829
01:31:56,762 --> 01:32:00,432
Why is such a beautiful country
so violent?

830
01:32:00,599 --> 01:32:01,976
History.

831
01:32:02,142 --> 01:32:06,897
Mom was telling me about when your
biggest worry was passing your exams.

832
01:32:07,064 --> 01:32:10,651
- Yes, it was then.
- I worry about you now.

833
01:32:10,818 --> 01:32:16,031
Oh, Mary, you're such a
warm-hearted girl. You always were.

834
01:32:16,198 --> 01:32:20,119
- I love my family.
- Even your cousin Vincent?

835
01:32:23,706 --> 01:32:25,833
I really love him.

836
01:32:27,042 --> 01:32:31,380
- He's your first cousin.
- Then I love him first.

837
01:32:31,547 --> 01:32:34,383
Mary, you can't see him.

838
01:32:34,884 --> 01:32:37,845
Just don't see him anymore.

839
01:32:38,012 --> 01:32:41,849
He's right. It's too dangerous.

840
01:32:43,809 --> 01:32:46,937
Mary, you can't see him anymore.

841
01:32:47,104 --> 01:32:49,565
- Not in that fashion.
- No.

842
01:32:51,025 --> 01:32:54,695
- Please, promise me.
- No!

843
01:32:54,862 --> 01:32:56,989
- Obey me on this.
- No, Dad!

844
01:33:02,411 --> 01:33:07,166
Mary is smart, Dad.
She'll understand eventually.

845
01:33:29,563 --> 01:33:32,691
<i>Bella cugina... Tesoro mio.</i>

846
01:33:43,786 --> 01:33:46,914
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

847
01:33:47,081 --> 01:33:50,751
I want you to do something for me.
It's dangerous.

848
01:33:52,503 --> 01:33:56,006
Good. I'm in. What do you need?

849
01:33:56,173 --> 01:33:59,844
I want you to sell your soul
to Don Altobello.

850
01:34:00,052 --> 01:34:02,596
To betray me.

851
01:34:05,224 --> 01:34:08,102
He'd never believe me.

852
01:34:08,269 --> 01:34:11,522
- That depends.
- Sit down.

853
01:34:13,607 --> 01:34:16,068
I have an idea.

854
01:34:16,735 --> 01:34:21,407
See if you can learn
how high Altobello is connected.

855
01:34:24,368 --> 01:34:26,829
Arrange a meeting.

856
01:34:28,831 --> 01:34:33,961
You say how devoted you are to me.
Tell him your problems.

857
01:34:34,378 --> 01:34:38,048
- Ask for his help.
- What problems?

858
01:34:39,425 --> 01:34:42,720
That you want to run away
with my daughter.

859
01:34:42,887 --> 01:34:47,850
But you know that if you do,
I will become your enemy.

860
01:34:51,854 --> 01:34:55,524
- You know that I would never do that.
- I know.

861
01:34:56,567 --> 01:35:01,697
<i>Ask Altobello to speak to me.
To further the marriage.</i>

862
01:35:01,906 --> 01:35:07,494
But you're cousins, after all. Michael
was always a little old-fashioned.

863
01:35:07,661 --> 01:35:12,875
Say you can't belong to my legitimate
world. That you want your own family.

864
01:35:13,501 --> 01:35:17,546
I could straighten out
what Joey Zasa left behind.

865
01:35:18,255 --> 01:35:21,675
I could use your friendship
to persuade him.

866
01:35:22,301 --> 01:35:25,471
I would be indebted to you forever.

867
01:35:27,181 --> 01:35:31,310
A Corleone knows the value
of such a friend.

868
01:35:32,603 --> 01:35:35,064
Then you would work for me?

869
01:35:36,148 --> 01:35:37,483
<i>S.</i>

870
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:42,905
<i>Bacio la mano, Don Altobello.</i>

871
01:35:45,533 --> 01:35:50,579
If he hints that he wants you
to betray me, get insulted...

872
01:35:51,163 --> 01:35:53,958
...because that's his trap.

873
01:36:00,422 --> 01:36:03,926
You're not telling me
the whole truth, Vincenzo.

874
01:36:06,762 --> 01:36:12,685
Isn't it true, that with Michael gone,
the girl controls everything?

875
01:36:16,230 --> 01:36:20,234
- Leave the girl out of this.
- Of course, you love her.

876
01:36:20,401 --> 01:36:22,945
And she loves you.

877
01:36:42,965 --> 01:36:45,718
I guessed it, didn't I?

878
01:36:47,469 --> 01:36:53,058
You're a wise man, Don Altobello.
I'll be learning a lot from you.

879
01:36:53,225 --> 01:36:57,396
The richest man is the one
with the most powerful friends.

880
01:36:59,064 --> 01:37:01,901
It's my duty to make the introductions.

881
01:37:08,991 --> 01:37:10,910
Don Lucchesi.

882
01:37:13,495 --> 01:37:19,293
Don Altobello tells me that you have
a strong character. A man of respect.

883
01:37:19,460 --> 01:37:22,963
This is the hero who put Joey Zasa
in his grave.

884
01:37:23,172 --> 01:37:27,593
If we'd known of his existence,
we wouldn't have backed Joey.

885
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:30,304
No one wants another Joe.

886
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:34,391
Let me be your friend.

887
01:37:34,558 --> 01:37:39,063
- Even the strongest man needs friends.
- I'm flattered.

888
01:37:40,064 --> 01:37:44,860
You're a man of finance and politics,
things I don't understand.

889
01:37:46,654 --> 01:37:50,908
You understand guns.
Finance is a gun.

890
01:37:51,450 --> 01:37:55,621
Politics is knowing
when to pull the trigger.

891
01:37:59,917 --> 01:38:02,294
How can I help?

892
01:38:02,503 --> 01:38:03,963
<i>Vieni?</i>

893
01:38:06,924 --> 01:38:12,555
Blessed is the peacemaker,
for he can be called the child of God.

894
01:38:12,721 --> 01:38:15,516
<i>- Tu parli Italiano un poco?
- S.</i>

895
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:40,958
The wheelchair, for Don Tommasino.

896
01:38:48,883 --> 01:38:53,304
I trusted this business arrangement
with the Archbishop. I trusted him.

897
01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:57,391
I was sure his honesty
was beyond a doubt.

898
01:38:57,558 --> 01:39:02,521
But, as you see, I'm now
the victim of a swindle.

899
01:39:02,730 --> 01:39:08,694
He's stalling me. Vast monies have
gone to people in high political places...

900
01:39:08,861 --> 01:39:11,655
...and the Vatican Bank is the guarantor.

901
01:39:11,822 --> 01:39:17,244
If what you say is true,
there will be a great scandal.

902
01:39:19,246 --> 01:39:24,126
Look at this stone. It has been
in the water for a very long time...

903
01:39:24,293 --> 01:39:28,547
...but the water has not penetrated it.

904
01:39:32,343 --> 01:39:33,719
Look...

905
01:39:34,762 --> 01:39:39,892
Perfectly dry. The same thing
has happened to men in Europe.

906
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:44,688
For centuries they have been
surrounded by Christianity...

907
01:39:44,855 --> 01:39:50,819
...but Christ has not penetrated.
Christ doesn't live within them.

908
01:39:54,698 --> 01:39:58,869
- What's happening?
- Could you get me something sweet?

909
01:39:59,036 --> 01:40:02,456
Some orange juice, candy...

910
01:40:06,168 --> 01:40:09,338
I have trouble with diabetes.

911
01:40:12,091 --> 01:40:14,718
My blood sugar goes low.

912
01:40:14,885 --> 01:40:17,012
I understand.

913
01:40:39,451 --> 01:40:42,955
It happens sometimes
when I'm under stress.

914
01:40:43,539 --> 01:40:45,833
I understand.

915
01:40:47,001 --> 01:40:51,380
To come to you
on such a delicate matter...

916
01:40:53,924 --> 01:40:58,971
Accusations against your Archbishop.
It was difficult for me.

917
01:41:00,181 --> 01:41:02,141
The mind suffers...

918
01:41:02,308 --> 01:41:05,519
...and the body cries out.

919
01:41:08,814 --> 01:41:12,234
That's true.

920
01:41:14,486 --> 01:41:18,616
Would you like to make
your confession?

921
01:41:25,164 --> 01:41:28,584
Your Eminence, I'm...

922
01:41:31,212 --> 01:41:37,301
It's been so long. I wouldn't...
I wouldn't know where to...

923
01:41:38,219 --> 01:41:40,304
It's been 30 years.

924
01:41:41,347 --> 01:41:44,934
I'd use up too much of your time, I think.

925
01:41:45,684 --> 01:41:48,145
I always have time to save souls.

926
01:41:49,438 --> 01:41:54,568
- Well, I'm beyond redemption.
- No, no...

927
01:42:03,744 --> 01:42:08,207
I hear the confessions
of my own priests here.

928
01:42:08,791 --> 01:42:12,711
Sometimes the desire to confess
is overwhelming...

929
01:42:12,878 --> 01:42:15,756
...and we must seize the moment.

930
01:42:19,969 --> 01:42:24,723
What is the point of confessing
if I don't repent?

931
01:42:26,183 --> 01:42:29,687
I hear you are a practical man.

932
01:42:29,895 --> 01:42:32,439
What have you got to lose?

933
01:42:43,659 --> 01:42:45,786
Go on.

934
01:42:51,792 --> 01:42:54,086
I...

935
01:42:54,295 --> 01:42:56,672
...betrayed my wife.

936
01:42:57,798 --> 01:43:00,551
Go on, my son.

937
01:43:05,014 --> 01:43:07,641
I betrayed myself.

938
01:43:10,019 --> 01:43:12,229
I killed men.

939
01:43:15,524 --> 01:43:18,652
And I ordered men to be killed.

940
01:43:19,528 --> 01:43:22,239
Go on, my son. Go on.

941
01:43:27,578 --> 01:43:29,079
It's useless.

942
01:43:30,998 --> 01:43:33,083
Go on, my son.

943
01:43:34,001 --> 01:43:36,378
I killed...

944
01:43:40,549 --> 01:43:43,677
I ordered the death of my brother.

945
01:43:44,261 --> 01:43:46,388
He injured me.

946
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:50,476
I killed my mother's son.

947
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:54,021
I killed my father's son.

948
01:44:04,281 --> 01:44:09,245
Your sins are terrible,
and it is just that you suffer.

949
01:44:10,621 --> 01:44:13,916
Your life could be redeemed...

950
01:44:14,083 --> 01:44:18,879
...but I know that you don't believe that.
You will not change.

951
01:44:48,450 --> 01:44:53,831
<i>Pope Paul VI, the Supreme Pontiff
of the Roman Catholic Church,...</i>

952
01:44:53,998 --> 01:44:57,751
<i>...died last night at 9/40 p. M.</i>

953
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:01,797
<i>The Pope was 81 years old,...</i>

954
01:45:01,964 --> 01:45:05,342
<i>...and had been in poor health
for the last several months.</i>

955
01:45:10,264 --> 01:45:12,349
Connie...

956
01:45:13,475 --> 01:45:18,355
All my life I've kept trying
to go up in society.

957
01:45:18,564 --> 01:45:23,194
To where everything higher up
was legal, straight...

958
01:45:23,652 --> 01:45:27,406
But the higher I go,
the more crooked it becomes.

959
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:32,536
Where the hell does it end?

960
01:45:40,878 --> 01:45:44,924
They've been killing each other
for centuries here.

961
01:45:45,883 --> 01:45:50,262
For money, for pride, for family.

962
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:57,853
<i>To keep from becoming the slaves
of the rich pezzi da novanta.</i>

963
01:46:04,276 --> 01:46:06,904
I made confession, Connie.

964
01:46:07,613 --> 01:46:10,241
I confessed my sins.

965
01:46:11,242 --> 01:46:16,956
Why? That's not like you. You don't
have to confess your sins to a stranger.

966
01:46:17,122 --> 01:46:18,874
It was the man.

967
01:46:20,251 --> 01:46:24,004
He's a good man. A true priest.

968
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:30,094
He can change things.

969
01:46:32,137 --> 01:46:34,223
Michael...

970
01:46:35,224 --> 01:46:38,978
You know, sometimes I think
of poor Fredo.

971
01:46:40,062 --> 01:46:43,899
Drowned. It was God's will.

972
01:46:45,943 --> 01:46:48,487
It was a terrible accident.

973
01:46:49,446 --> 01:46:51,657
But it's finished.

974
01:46:56,579 --> 01:46:58,956
Michael, I love you.

975
01:47:00,791 --> 01:47:03,169
I'll always help you.

976
01:47:15,014 --> 01:47:17,099
Oh, Connie...

977
01:47:46,504 --> 01:47:53,302
I am honored, Don Altobello, that
you've come from Palermo to visit me.

978
01:47:56,805 --> 01:48:01,602
Hey, the little kid! He's grown.

979
01:48:02,728 --> 01:48:04,396
Do the donkey for me.

980
01:48:21,705 --> 01:48:26,502
It's been some time since we
did business together.

981
01:48:29,547 --> 01:48:34,134
You are my "ace in the hole,"
as we say in America.

982
01:48:35,052 --> 01:48:41,141
I have a stone in my shoe.
You can remove it.

983
01:48:48,107 --> 01:48:50,484
Only one stone?

984
01:48:52,945 --> 01:48:58,868
It's dangerous. A famous man.

985
01:48:59,034 --> 01:49:02,288
You will have to take precautions.

986
01:49:05,291 --> 01:49:10,504
Tell me what to do.
Then I will tell you my price.

987
01:49:15,384 --> 01:49:17,845
Ah, what bread!

988
01:49:22,141 --> 01:49:24,226
Olive oil...

989
01:49:29,481 --> 01:49:33,152
Virgin... Only in Sicily.

990
01:49:35,696 --> 01:49:37,239
<i>Alla salute!</i>

991
01:49:37,406 --> 01:49:39,200
To death.

992
01:49:52,922 --> 01:49:54,673
Kay!

993
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:56,967
- Connie!
- How are you?

994
01:49:57,176 --> 01:50:00,179
Mary, I've missed you.

995
01:50:00,804 --> 01:50:04,975
- Hello, Michael.
- Mom, look at this.

996
01:50:08,437 --> 01:50:14,443
- It's too bad Douglas couldn't come.
- I know. He had a very important trial.

997
01:50:14,610 --> 01:50:17,321
I know he wanted to come.

998
01:50:17,738 --> 01:50:19,865
- The car is...
- Okay.

999
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:28,123
- Well, your son is an artist.
- Oh, yes. Thanks to you.

1000
01:50:28,290 --> 01:50:33,045
- What for?
- For making me let him go.

1001
01:50:33,546 --> 01:50:38,592
Well, after all these years,
here I am in Sicily for the first time.

1002
01:50:38,759 --> 01:50:42,137
- I want to get a picture of you together.
- Okay.

1003
01:50:43,973 --> 01:50:46,058
Hey, Dad. Smile!

1004
01:50:50,271 --> 01:50:54,108
I see you still have Al Neri. Why?

1005
01:50:54,316 --> 01:50:58,904
I need him. He helps me
get in and out of the car.

1006
01:50:59,071 --> 01:51:03,242
- He carries my briefcase.
- You're still a liar, Michael.

1007
01:51:04,159 --> 01:51:10,249
<i>Let me show you Sicily, the real Sicily.
So you'll understand the family history.</i>

1008
01:51:10,457 --> 01:51:13,669
I think I understand it more than enough.

1009
01:52:05,054 --> 01:52:10,893
Anthony, I have something you made
for me a very long time ago.

1010
01:52:12,811 --> 01:52:15,856
- Might bring you luck.
- Thanks.

1011
01:52:19,485 --> 01:52:22,780
You saved it... I remember.

1012
01:52:26,951 --> 01:52:29,036
Thank you, Dad.

1013
01:52:30,371 --> 01:52:31,956
I'm proud of you.

1014
01:52:32,748 --> 01:52:34,625
Thank you.

1015
01:52:50,474 --> 01:52:53,185
- Are they as good as they look?
- Better.

1016
01:52:53,352 --> 01:52:58,065
They're the best. As long as they are
around, Uncle Michael is safe.

1017
01:52:58,232 --> 01:53:00,609
Goodbye.

1018
01:53:02,570 --> 01:53:05,990
- Tell your father I'll be back for dinner.
- Okay.

1019
01:53:06,156 --> 01:53:08,784
- Have fun.
- Tell Tony to wait for me.

1020
01:53:08,951 --> 01:53:11,036
I will.

1021
01:53:12,872 --> 01:53:16,125
<i>Buongiorno, signora. At your service.</i>

1022
01:53:20,421 --> 01:53:23,924
If I see Dad, I'll tell him you left.

1023
01:53:29,013 --> 01:53:32,683
You're the only one left
with my father's strength.

1024
01:53:34,894 --> 01:53:39,356
If anything happens to Michael,
I want you to strike back.

1025
01:53:41,817 --> 01:53:43,611
I'll have everything ready.

1026
01:53:47,281 --> 01:53:50,075
Do you swear?

1027
01:53:56,332 --> 01:53:58,792
I swear to you.

1028
01:54:28,572 --> 01:54:30,866
Here it is.

1029
01:54:31,951 --> 01:54:35,079
The house where my father was born.

1030
01:54:35,621 --> 01:54:41,335
This is where they came to take him
when he was a boy. To kill him.

1031
01:54:44,421 --> 01:54:46,131
Wait...

1032
01:54:46,882 --> 01:54:48,968
Listen to that.

1033
01:55:08,028 --> 01:55:11,073
You know Mary's in love.

1034
01:55:11,448 --> 01:55:13,826
Yes, I know.

1035
01:55:14,118 --> 01:55:18,330
With a handsome young Italian man
with dark eyes...

1036
01:55:19,623 --> 01:55:21,834
I won't allow it.

1037
01:55:24,044 --> 01:55:27,882
It's wrong. It's wrong and it's dangerous.

1038
01:55:28,257 --> 01:55:31,051
"Oh, father, my father!"

1039
01:55:31,468 --> 01:55:34,013
"Give me time to pray
to the Lord. "

1040
01:55:34,221 --> 01:55:39,101
The Baroness of Carini had
betrayed her husband...

1041
01:55:39,268 --> 01:55:41,562
...and fallen in love with her cousin.

1042
01:55:41,770 --> 01:55:43,147
"There will be no forgiveness!"

1043
01:55:43,314 --> 01:55:47,610
Her father stabbed her through
the heart.

1044
01:56:00,039 --> 01:56:01,999
Honour, huh?

1045
01:56:20,893 --> 01:56:24,021
I remember the time you came
to my parents' house...

1046
01:56:24,188 --> 01:56:27,608
...and told me about the family business.

1047
01:56:27,816 --> 01:56:33,447
How you'd never have anything
to do with it. You sounded like Tony.

1048
01:56:33,989 --> 01:56:37,117
I was a lot like Tony.

1049
01:56:43,499 --> 01:56:46,502
- I can barely see him... Kay?
- What?

1050
01:56:46,669 --> 01:56:49,046
- Do you mind driving?
- What's wrong?

1051
01:56:49,255 --> 01:56:52,383
My eyes. Sometimes
they're all right, but...

1052
01:56:53,843 --> 01:56:56,679
I have to see Don Tommasino...

1053
01:56:59,807 --> 01:57:01,892
Well...

1054
01:57:02,351 --> 01:57:06,105
- There are no bodyguards today.
- I really snuck away.

1055
01:57:13,279 --> 01:57:17,741
Father, where are you going?
Would you like a ride?

1056
01:57:27,209 --> 01:57:31,130
I know you. You're Mosca
of Montelepre.

1057
01:57:32,381 --> 01:57:36,218
You were an assassin then,
and you're an assassin now.

1058
01:57:36,385 --> 01:57:39,722
I know Michael Corleone
is at your house.

1059
01:57:39,889 --> 01:57:43,184
I will pass through the gates
with you.

1060
01:57:58,991 --> 01:58:00,659
How are you?

1061
01:58:00,826 --> 01:58:04,997
This is Calo, one of my bodyguards
in the old days.

1062
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:12,880
- We can wait here.
- You want a drink?

1063
01:58:18,135 --> 01:58:21,263
I spent a lot of time in this room...

1064
01:58:22,139 --> 01:58:24,266
...thinking of you.

1065
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:30,189
And then you got married.

1066
01:58:33,359 --> 01:58:37,196
- I still thought of you.
- What's in that room?

1067
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:45,371
This is dangerous for you. This is Sicily.

1068
01:58:47,873 --> 01:58:51,043
- I love this country.
- Why?

1069
01:58:52,795 --> 01:58:58,884
Well, all through history, terrible things
have happened to these people.

1070
01:58:59,593 --> 01:59:02,263
Terrible injustices.

1071
01:59:02,930 --> 01:59:08,143
But they still expect good,
rather than bad, will happen to them.

1072
01:59:08,352 --> 01:59:11,313
Sort of like me and you?

1073
01:59:14,483 --> 01:59:17,987
- How so?
- I'm still here, right?

1074
01:59:18,195 --> 01:59:21,365
We do have a bad history,
but I'm still here.

1075
01:59:21,532 --> 01:59:24,076
Yes, you are, but with dread.

1076
01:59:28,998 --> 01:59:30,708
Give me the order!

1077
01:59:31,208 --> 01:59:34,879
Is that supposed to make me
not dread you?

1078
01:59:36,839 --> 01:59:39,550
We're in Sicily. It's opera.

1079
01:59:41,343 --> 01:59:43,429
Okay.

1080
01:59:45,306 --> 01:59:47,683
What do we do now?

1081
01:59:50,269 --> 01:59:55,065
Be reasonable.
Let's try not to hurt each other.

1082
02:00:01,488 --> 02:00:04,325
I want you to forgive me.

1083
02:00:06,702 --> 02:00:09,830
- For what?
- Everything.

1084
02:00:13,209 --> 02:00:16,212
Oh, like God?

1085
02:00:16,921 --> 02:00:20,007
No, I need something a little closer.

1086
02:00:22,843 --> 02:00:26,013
You couldn't understand,
back in those days.

1087
02:00:27,556 --> 02:00:32,353
I loved my father. I swore I would
never be a man like him...

1088
02:00:32,561 --> 02:00:36,815
...but I loved him and he was in danger.
What could I do?

1089
02:00:36,982 --> 02:00:40,402
And then later, you were in danger.

1090
02:00:40,611 --> 02:00:44,532
Our children were in danger.
What could I do?

1091
02:00:44,740 --> 02:00:50,412
You were all that I... Loved and valued
most in the world.

1092
02:00:52,081 --> 02:00:54,750
Now I'm losing you. I lost you.

1093
02:00:55,626 --> 02:00:57,837
You're gone.

1094
02:00:58,838 --> 02:01:02,508
And it was all for nothing. So...

1095
02:01:06,595 --> 02:01:11,725
You have to understand,
I had a whole different destiny planned.

1096
02:01:14,854 --> 02:01:17,523
All right, I'll stop.

1097
02:01:27,366 --> 02:01:31,453
I really don't know what you
want from me, Michael.

1098
02:01:31,620 --> 02:01:36,584
- I mean...
- I'm not the man that you think I am.

1099
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:42,047
- I don't know.
- I love you, Kay.

1100
02:01:43,340 --> 02:01:46,093
Don't dread me anymore.

1101
02:01:51,098 --> 02:01:55,144
You know, every night here in Sicily...

1102
02:01:57,146 --> 02:02:02,651
...I dream about my wife
and my children...

1103
02:02:05,905 --> 02:02:08,282
...and how I lost them.

1104
02:02:09,909 --> 02:02:15,664
I guess that if it's any consolation,
I want you to know that...

1105
02:02:19,001 --> 02:02:20,377
...that...

1106
02:02:21,504 --> 02:02:24,256
...I always loved you, Michael.

1107
02:02:25,424 --> 02:02:27,301
And you know...

1108
02:02:28,928 --> 02:02:31,555
...always, I always will.

1109
02:02:59,375 --> 02:03:01,210
What is it? What's wrong?

1110
02:03:02,461 --> 02:03:05,548
They found Don Tommasino shot.

1111
02:03:06,799 --> 02:03:08,342
Is he dead?

1112
02:03:10,511 --> 02:03:14,265
My master is dead.
Blood calls for blood.

1113
02:03:14,682 --> 02:03:17,977
I must have revenge!

1114
02:03:20,938 --> 02:03:26,485
Some day, you may have to do
a difficult service for me.

1115
02:03:26,986 --> 02:03:29,530
Command me.

1116
02:03:29,989 --> 02:03:31,365
It never ends.

1117
02:03:31,532 --> 02:03:33,993
I will avenge him!

1118
02:03:48,924 --> 02:03:50,634
Totals...

1119
02:03:52,344 --> 02:03:55,222
Lorscheider, 1 vote.

1120
02:03:55,639 --> 02:03:58,559
Siri, 11 votes.

1121
02:03:59,226 --> 02:04:03,147
Lamberto, 99 votes.

1122
02:04:08,027 --> 02:04:13,657
Do you accept your election
as supreme pontiff?

1123
02:04:13,824 --> 02:04:19,622
Oh God, shed light on the decision
they have taken on my behalf.

1124
02:04:20,623 --> 02:04:22,249
I accept.

1125
02:04:22,416 --> 02:04:24,960
By what name do you
wish to be called?

1126
02:04:25,169 --> 02:04:28,214
John Paul the First.

1127
02:04:57,660 --> 02:05:03,457
I will do things "right away,"
rather than in "a little while"...

1128
02:05:04,750 --> 02:05:10,047
<i>Frederick Keinszig, known as "God's
Banker", has been reported missing.</i>

1129
02:05:10,214 --> 02:05:16,929
<i>He was last seen leaving the Rome
offices of Vatican owned Immobiliare.</i>

1130
02:05:17,638 --> 02:05:21,559
<i>Also missing was a large sum
of money and several documents.</i>

1131
02:05:22,643 --> 02:05:25,312
Keinszig, you fool.

1132
02:05:27,898 --> 02:05:32,945
<i>His absence casts further suspicion
on the dealings of the Vatican Bank.</i>

1133
02:05:33,112 --> 02:05:35,990
<i>For several years,
the bank and its companies...</i>

1134
02:05:36,157 --> 02:05:40,703
<i>...have been the object of allegations
of disreputable business practices.</i>

1135
02:05:41,370 --> 02:05:45,666
Lucchesi, will you please
try to understand?

1136
02:05:46,834 --> 02:05:51,589
I have phoned him.
I have waited here by the phone.

1137
02:05:54,049 --> 02:05:58,679
<i>You would do well to remember,
Mr Lucchesi...</i>

1138
02:05:58,846 --> 02:06:05,853
...that this Pope has very different ideas
from the last one.

1139
02:06:27,416 --> 02:06:29,710
Goodbye, my old friend.

1140
02:06:32,087 --> 02:06:35,508
You could have lived a little longer.

1141
02:06:35,674 --> 02:06:39,053
I could be closer to my dream.

1142
02:06:44,183 --> 02:06:47,561
You were so loved, Don Tommasino.

1143
02:06:51,941 --> 02:06:55,861
Why was I so feared,
and you so loved?

1144
02:06:56,946 --> 02:06:59,156
What was it?

1145
02:06:59,615 --> 02:07:02,451
I was no less honourable.

1146
02:07:03,786 --> 02:07:06,080
I wanted to do good.

1147
02:07:09,875 --> 02:07:13,295
What betrayed me?
My mind? My heart?

1148
02:07:15,923 --> 02:07:18,759
Why do I condemn myself so?

1149
02:07:24,890 --> 02:07:27,017
I swear...

1150
02:07:27,226 --> 02:07:30,020
...on the lives of my children...

1151
02:07:33,983 --> 02:07:37,027
Give me a chance to redeem myself...

1152
02:07:40,656 --> 02:07:44,410
...and I will sin no more.

1153
02:08:08,142 --> 02:08:12,479
You look pale. Bad news?
Tell me right away.

1154
02:08:14,398 --> 02:08:17,818
It's not just a bad banking deal.

1155
02:08:18,027 --> 02:08:21,071
These guys are butchers.

1156
02:08:21,238 --> 02:08:24,408
- What guys?
- Lucchesi.

1157
02:08:25,743 --> 02:08:30,122
He controls all of them:
Altobello, the Archbishop...

1158
02:08:31,248 --> 02:08:33,918
...others higher up, P2 maybe.

1159
02:08:34,084 --> 02:08:38,005
Secret unknown.
They're running things.

1160
02:08:41,008 --> 02:08:46,222
- I'm in their way.
- He's hired an assassin to kill you.

1161
02:08:46,430 --> 02:08:49,850
A Sicilian. I don't know his name.

1162
02:08:51,143 --> 02:08:53,604
But they say he never fails.

1163
02:08:54,647 --> 02:08:57,191
Then no one is safe.

1164
02:08:59,610 --> 02:09:02,947
Even the new Pope is in danger.

1165
02:09:03,113 --> 02:09:07,117
We still have time. We can prevent this.

1166
02:09:11,372 --> 02:09:14,208
I tried, Vincent.

1167
02:09:16,001 --> 02:09:18,838
I tried...

1168
02:09:19,004 --> 02:09:24,593
...to keep everything from coming
to this. But it's not possible.

1169
02:09:24,760 --> 02:09:27,137
Not in this world.

1170
02:09:28,222 --> 02:09:30,266
Give me the order.

1171
02:09:33,727 --> 02:09:36,856
You won't be able to go back.

1172
02:09:37,022 --> 02:09:40,109
- You'll be like me.
- Good.

1173
02:09:40,985 --> 02:09:43,612
All my life I wanted out.

1174
02:09:43,779 --> 02:09:46,615
I wanted the family out.

1175
02:09:47,950 --> 02:09:49,660
I don't want out.

1176
02:09:50,286 --> 02:09:53,455
I want the power to preserve the family.

1177
02:09:57,710 --> 02:10:00,171
I'm asking for the order.

1178
02:10:20,774 --> 02:10:22,985
It's done.

1179
02:10:24,028 --> 02:10:26,864
Because I can't do it anymore.

1180
02:10:30,034 --> 02:10:34,038
Well, it doesn't matter.
Vincent knows what to do.

1181
02:10:34,205 --> 02:10:39,251
Come on outside.
Take a rest and don't think about it.

1182
02:10:39,460 --> 02:10:43,589
- All I do is think about it.
- I'm your son.

1183
02:10:43,756 --> 02:10:46,592
Command me in all things.

1184
02:10:48,010 --> 02:10:50,721
Give up my daughter.

1185
02:10:53,098 --> 02:10:56,268
That's the price you pay...

1186
02:10:56,435 --> 02:10:59,146
...for the life you choose.

1187
02:11:24,630 --> 02:11:26,549
Nephew...

1188
02:11:28,676 --> 02:11:31,053
...from this moment on...

1189
02:11:32,471 --> 02:11:35,432
...call yourself Vincent Corleone.

1190
02:11:39,562 --> 02:11:41,230
Sit.

1191
02:11:55,995 --> 02:11:58,080
Don Vincenzo...

1192
02:12:03,794 --> 02:12:05,629
Don Corleone...

1193
02:12:08,716 --> 02:12:11,427
Don Vincenzo Corleone...

1194
02:13:44,770 --> 02:13:46,146
<i>E tu, Vincenzo...</i>

1195
02:13:47,189 --> 02:13:52,069
I know how you feel about Michael,
but you can't save him.

1196
02:13:52,778 --> 02:13:54,572
He's lost.

1197
02:13:55,739 --> 02:13:57,324
Think of yourself.

1198
02:13:58,742 --> 02:14:01,579
What's your answer, Vincent?

1199
02:14:02,997 --> 02:14:05,708
Enjoy the opera.

1200
02:14:07,042 --> 02:14:09,670
It's all taken care of.

1201
02:14:14,383 --> 02:14:17,303
Check the bar. I'll check the top floor.

1202
02:14:21,056 --> 02:14:25,352
"Here's hoping Tony sings better at the
Teatro Massimo than in the shower. "

1203
02:14:25,519 --> 02:14:27,563
"Love, Douglas. "

1204
02:14:27,730 --> 02:14:31,317
- My darling Constanza!
- Don Altobello.

1205
02:14:32,234 --> 02:14:35,821
- This is a great occasion.
- Come, sit down.

1206
02:14:39,700 --> 02:14:44,330
Happy birthday.
You're 80, but don't look more than 60.

1207
02:14:44,497 --> 02:14:46,207
You're the only one who remembered.

1208
02:14:46,624 --> 02:14:52,004
We've just got the word. The Pope has
ratified the Immobiliare deal. We've won.

1209
02:14:52,171 --> 02:14:54,215
Congratulations.

1210
02:14:56,592 --> 02:14:58,886
Strange how things work.

1211
02:14:59,053 --> 02:15:04,016
The Pope is doing what you said
he'd do. He's cleaning house.

1212
02:15:04,225 --> 02:15:08,604
He should be careful.
It's dangerous to be an honest man.

1213
02:15:14,276 --> 02:15:18,572
I want to put more muscle backstage
with Tony.

1214
02:15:29,291 --> 02:15:32,711
On your birthday you used to
shower me with treats.

1215
02:15:32,878 --> 02:15:35,339
Tootsie Rolls!

1216
02:15:35,506 --> 02:15:41,011
The nuns who made this cannoli took a
vow of silence. They're the very finest.

1217
02:15:44,682 --> 02:15:47,935
- Hey.
- Hey, cous.

1218
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:52,690
Hi. Where's your leather?

1219
02:15:56,318 --> 02:15:57,862
Stop it.

1220
02:16:03,784 --> 02:16:07,204
You're so thin. You eat it.

1221
02:16:23,804 --> 02:16:25,181
<i> buono.</i>

1222
02:16:25,806 --> 02:16:28,184
<i>Grazie!</i>

1223
02:16:30,978 --> 02:16:35,232
It's over. There are things I have to do
that you can't be part of.

1224
02:16:35,399 --> 02:16:38,444
It's not your father's decision, it's mine.

1225
02:16:40,070 --> 02:16:42,698
Don't hate your father.

1226
02:16:44,325 --> 02:16:48,162
There are things I'll be part of
that you can't be around.

1227
02:16:50,206 --> 02:16:53,709
After tonight,
you won't see me anymore.

1228
02:16:57,213 --> 02:17:01,383
You've got to understand, Mary.
You've got to understand.

1229
02:17:01,926 --> 02:17:04,595
I'll always love you.

1230
02:17:16,857 --> 02:17:18,275
Love somebody else.

1231
02:20:59,705 --> 02:21:03,792
- They won't try anything.
- Everything's fine. It's all clear.

1232
02:21:03,959 --> 02:21:07,004
I've already sent Al Neri to the Vatican.

1233
02:21:18,849 --> 02:21:21,644
Mr. Lucchesi's house?

1234
02:21:23,312 --> 02:21:27,608
I bring a message from
Michael Corleone.

1235
02:21:29,026 --> 02:21:31,028
Let him in.

1236
02:22:59,450 --> 02:23:01,202
<i>Buona sera.</i>

1237
02:26:22,444 --> 02:26:25,072
Good. You got him.

1238
02:27:16,582 --> 02:27:20,169
<i>Tonight the Corleone family
settles its accounts.</i>

1239
02:27:20,336 --> 02:27:25,090
<i>Keinszig...
That little Swiss banker fuck.</i>

1240
02:27:26,258 --> 02:27:30,763
<i>He's been swindling everyone
from the beginning. Fuck him.</i>

1241
02:27:31,680 --> 02:27:34,350
<i>Don Lucchesi, my friend.</i>

1242
02:27:34,517 --> 02:27:37,603
<i>Calo will pay him a visit at his home.</i>

1243
02:27:39,647 --> 02:27:43,067
<i>Neri, take a train to Rome.</i>

1244
02:27:44,693 --> 02:27:46,612
<i>Light a candle for the Archbishop.</i>

1245
02:28:22,982 --> 02:28:26,360
Tea, Your Holiness? It will help
you sleep.

1246
02:28:48,924 --> 02:28:51,844
This is from Vincent Corleone.

1247
02:29:50,069 --> 02:29:54,949
It's serious. Our man inside the Vatican
says there's a plot against the Pope.

1248
02:29:55,115 --> 02:29:57,243
He'll have a heart attack?

1249
02:30:04,416 --> 02:30:09,630
This Pope has powerful enemies.
We may not be in time to save him.

1250
02:30:12,466 --> 02:30:14,093
Let's go back.

1251
02:30:56,177 --> 02:30:58,637
<i>Eminenza...</i>

1252
02:31:06,604 --> 02:31:08,814
The Holy Father is dead!

1253
02:32:38,654 --> 02:32:40,030
Sleep.

1254
02:32:41,365 --> 02:32:43,742
Sleep, Godfather.

1255
02:33:53,479 --> 02:33:55,564
Speak... Tell me.

1256
02:33:57,233 --> 02:34:02,988
You have lost the
faith of the people.

1257
02:34:05,074 --> 02:34:08,911
He who builds on the people
builds on mud.

1258
02:34:09,370 --> 02:34:13,457
And Michael Corleone's message?

1259
02:34:30,599 --> 02:34:36,689
It's very important.
I must whisper it in your ear.

1260
02:34:40,609 --> 02:34:42,528
He's clean.

1261
02:35:00,504 --> 02:35:03,549
Power wears out those
who don't have it.

1262
02:36:32,096 --> 02:36:35,391
- I like this outfit.
- I figured you would.

1263
02:36:35,558 --> 02:36:37,268
Say hello.

1264
02:36:59,373 --> 02:37:03,210
- Can I talk to you now?
- No, it's not a good time.

1265
02:37:03,419 --> 02:37:07,423
- You're just like my father.
- Stay with the family. Go on.

1266
02:37:08,716 --> 02:37:10,509
- Talk to me.
- The twins are dead.

1267
02:37:10,676 --> 02:37:15,639
In about one minute, there will be
carabinieri all over this place.

1268
02:37:15,806 --> 02:37:18,350
Get everybody to the cars, quietly.

1269
02:37:18,559 --> 02:37:21,020
- Got it.
- Quiet.

1270
02:37:35,034 --> 02:37:38,120
The name Corleone
will be associated with a voice.

1271
02:37:48,130 --> 02:37:49,757
Dad...

1272
02:38:09,109 --> 02:38:12,613
Dad... Why are you doing this to me?

1273
02:38:21,914 --> 02:38:24,750
Move back, move back.

1274
02:38:25,209 --> 02:38:30,589
- You don't have to do this to me.
- Do what? What do you mean?

1275
02:38:56,615 --> 02:38:58,701
Dad...

1276
02:39:14,758 --> 02:39:17,469
No! Mary!

1277
02:39:20,347 --> 02:39:21,724
God, no!
