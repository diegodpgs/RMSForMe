Eh-

29
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,566
Aye, you've gotta go
straight along that way and-

30
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,449
This is gonna be pure hard to explain.

31
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,091
- Do you know where the Asda is?
- No.

32
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,283
Yeah, I don't even know
what way you're pointin'. What?

33
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,840
- See, if you just drive straight along up there-
- Yes?

34
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,571
And see the traffic lights up there?

35
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,165
Take a right.

36
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,969
Then you'll go past lbrox Stadium, right?

37
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,849
And go straight through a roundabout.

38
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,323
Then take a left.
So it's right, then just-

39
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,164
And it's there. The motorway is there.

40
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,765
It's back of Asda. You'll see it.

41
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,888
- Back of Asda, see?
- Okay.

42
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,281
- Am I keeping you from something?
- No.

43
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,163
- Where are you going?
- Along here.

44
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,449
- For what? For work?
- No, I need to go meet somebody.

45
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,204
- Oh, you're going to meet someone.
- Aye.

46
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,770
- All right. Thank you.
- Sure.

47
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,881
<i>I'm looking for a post office.</i>

48
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,883
<i>- Post office?
- Yes.</i>

49
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,485
Where are you from?

50
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,721
- Where I am from?
- Yeah.

51
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,201
- Albania.
- Oh, are you?

52
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,810
- You have family here?
- Yes.

53
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,291
Oh, you do.

54
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,489
That's the reason I'm saying
you have to go another way...

55
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,403
for another-

56
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,801
it's after the shopping ce-

57
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,608
- Hi.
- Lost?

58
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,603
- Yeah, lost.
- What are you looking for?

59
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,411
- I'm looking for the M8.
- Up to the roundabout-

60
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,130
- Are you walking?
- Yep.

61
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,202
- Where are you walking to?
- Home.

62
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,244
- Oh, you're going home. To your family?
- No, no, just myself.

63
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,368
- Just yourself?
- Aye. it's great.

64
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,762
- Yeah? How?
- I can do whatever I like.

65
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,605
- So where are you coming from?
- Govan. Right there.

66
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,125
- Sorry?
- Govan.

67
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,283
- Govan? Do you work there?
- No, no.

68
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,761
Don't work there. I work for myself.

69
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,362
- Do you want a lift?
- Eh- Aye, why not?

70
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,806
You'll have to tell me how to get there.

71
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,406
- Just follow this road straight up.
- Okay.

72
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,050
Sure.

73
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,282
- So what do you do?
- Electrician.

74
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,890
Oh, you're an electrician.

75
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,326
- It's cold, right?
- Ah, it's a wee bit nippy, aye.

76
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,368
Yeah.

77
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,729
So what is it youse all doing?

78
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,802
I'm- I'm just, uh, driving-

79
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,442
just, uh... some furniture
for my family and-

80
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,841
- Oh, right?
- Yeah.

81
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,524
So you live alone?

82
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,125
- Yes.
- And you love it?

83
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,329
- Aye. it's great.
- What do you love about living alone?

84
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,051
- Nobody to nag you.
- Do I go straight through?

85
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,408
Yeah, just straight through.
Straight through the whole way.

86
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,007
It should be just cart around that street
and stay in the right hand lane.

87
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,447
- What's that?
- That's a tattoo of my name.

88
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,931
- Of your name?
- Yeah.

89
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,161

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,403
The spot back here, you get-
you put your hand out. Anybody can stop.

95
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,006
There's lonely old guys. Know what I mean?

96
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,602
It was- Hey, might as well check her out,
driving away in a big van.

97
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,843
Sure you can drive this, huh? Huh?

98
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,648
- No girlfriend? Really?
- Nah, I don't have a girlfriend at all.

99
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,922
You're very charming.

100
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,685
That's better.

101
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,242
Yeah? Sorted?

102
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,242

- Aye?

103
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,891
- Yeah.
- Thanks a lot. Cheers.

104
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,531
- Do you think I'm pretty?
- I think you're gorgeous.

105
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,682
- Do you?
- Aye, definitely.

106
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,850
Good.

107
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,722
And a friendly smile as well.

108
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,609
- Do I?
- Aye, right deep.

109
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,967
- What about your smile?
- Aye.

110
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,451
You've a nice smile yourself.

111
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,887
- Cheers.
- Good.

112
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,530
Good.

113
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,408
No, no, no, lads! No!

114
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,244
- Mommy!
- Whoo!

115
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,129
I thought...

116
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,929
you had your eye on my towel.

117
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,929
No. I wanted to speak to you.

118
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,486
Do you know if there's any good spots
to surf around here?

119
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,130
I'm not a surfer.

120
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,248
Just living in a little tent over there.

121
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,971
- Just hanging around.
- Yeah?

122
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,203
- Reading, swimming.
- You're not from here? Where are you from?

123
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,049
- I'm from Czech Republic.
- Why are you in Scotland?

124
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,840
I just... wanted to get away from it all.

125
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,082
Yeah? Why here?

126
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,889
Because it's-

127
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,485
it's nowhere.

128
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,930
Whoa! Whoa, whoa. Excuse me.

129
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,281
Can I talk to you
before you run away, darling?

130
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,601
I wanted to speak to you earlier,
right, but you disappeared.

131
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,524
I thought you went to the ladies'
or somethin'.

132
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,002
Anyway, right, fuck all that shite. Right?

133
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,004
I really want to buy you a drink, man.
You look absolutely stunning.

134
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,650
And I-

135
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,008
You know what?
I'm all alone. You're all alone.

136
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,208
What do you say? What's one drink?

137
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,805
What's one drink?

138
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,565
- I saw you on the road.
- What, you saw me on the road?

139
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,405
- Earlier, yeah.
- Are you having a laugh with me?

140
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,881
You saw me?
You wanna come get a drink and a dance?

141
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,725
- Are you alone here?
- Yeah, I'm all alone. Right?

142
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,645
The man from the car,
he buy the rose for you.

143

<i>are believed to have been with him.</i>

155
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,523
<i>A police and coast guard search operation
involving a helicopter...</i>

156
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,682
<i>has been halted due to fog.</i>

157
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,524
<i>The next bulletin is on the hour.</i>

158
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,283
<i>Well, plenty to talk about,
as ever, with Kay.</i>

159
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,931
<i>You can call now- 10-500-92-95-00.</i>

160
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,923
<i>You can text as well- 80295.</i>

161
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,082
<i>- It's 8:17.
- Good morning, Gary.</i>

162
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,970
<i>Well, as we've heard,
for a whole host of reasons...</i>

163
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,281
<i>2014 is a very important year
for Scotland.</i>

164
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,806
<i>Of course, the referendum.
We're expecting that date today.</i>

165
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,884
<i>But the Commonwealth Games
and Ryder Cup-</i>

166
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,042
<i>- You seem very excited about that.
- lam.</i>

167
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,363
<i>He's jumping out of his seat at
the prospect of the year he's gonna have-</i>

168
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,567
Fuckin' hell, you're gorgeous.

169
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,881
- You think so?
- It's your eyes.

170
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,328
Somethin' about your eyes.

171
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,051
Your eyes, your lips.

172
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,122
- That black hair.
- Yeah?

173
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,089
You just look...

174
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,805
amazing.

175
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,284
Hey, you okay?

176
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,603
Want a hand up? Want a hand?

177
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,847
Get out, eh? Get out!

178
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,965
Excuse me.

179
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,691
Excuse me.

180
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,684
Uh, I'm a bit lost, really.

181
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,802
Am I headed towards Taynuilt?

182
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,007
Yeah.

183
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,924
I am? Is it far?

184
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,082
It's about 10 minutes away.

185
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,447
Ten minutes?
Are you- Are you headed there?

186
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,004
I'm going to the supermarket.

187
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,923
Is it on the way?

188
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,005
Yeah.

189
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,321
I could drop you off if you'd like.

190
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,082
Yeah?

191
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,525
Here. Let me turn this up for you.

192
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,884
That's better.

193
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,884
You're very quiet.

194
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,331
So why do you shop at night then?

195
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,284
People wind me up.

196
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:02,681
How?

197
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,763
They're ignorant.

198
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,727
What about your friends?

199
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,162
So you don't have any friends?

200
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,520
No.

201
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,244
How about a girlfriend?

202
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,210
How old are you?

203
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,365
I'm 26.

204
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,089
When was the last time
you had a girlfriend?

205
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,529
Never had one.

206
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,489
So don't you get lonely then?

207
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,610
You've very nice hands.

208
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,604
You've beautiful hands.

209
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,722
Do you want to look at me?

210
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,451
- This isn't Tesco's, is it?
- No.

211
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,166
I noticed you looking at me before.

212
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,001
And?

213
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,683
I liked it.

214
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,447
You're uncomfortable.

215
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,126
No. Just want to go to Tesco's.

216
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,011
So you never think about it then?

217
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,410
Think about what?

218
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,842
Being with a girl.

219
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,882
When was the last time
you touched someone?

220
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,688
Let me see your hands.

221
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,245
Cold.

222
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,243
I have to get back soon.

223
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,322
How was that?

224
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,531
Cold.

225
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,161
Do you want to do it again?

226
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,208
Yeah.

227
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,527
Do you want to touch my neck?

228
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,090
Here.

229
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,808
How was that?

230
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,164
Yeah.

231
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,882
Your hands are very soft.

232
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,410
I have a place about 30 minutes away.

233
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,960
Will you come with me there?

234
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,525
Cold.

235
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,921
I won't let that stop us.

236
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,210
Come to me.

237
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,608
Dreaming?

238
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,966
Yes.

239
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,730
Dreaming?

240
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,484
Yes, we are.

241
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:49,684
The bus will be along in a minute.

242
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,681
Do you not think you should
be wearing a jacket, little lass?

243
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,047
The weather's terrible up here.

244
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:54,330
You'll catch your death of cold if you've
not got a jacket or a hat or something on.

245
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:00,040
You've not got the right clothes on at all.

246
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,563
You all right there?

247
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,484
Eh?

248
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,284
You okay?

249
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,930
Can I do something for you?

250
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,401
Chase yourself, dafty.

251
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:28,848
Leave the lassie alone.
She doesn't want anything to do with you.

252
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,562
Do you need any help?

253
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,965
Yes.

254
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,045
Right.

255
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,402
Let me just take your coat.

256
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,002
<i>Spoon, Jar. Jar, spoon.</i>

257
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:28,766
<i>Spoon, Jar. Jar-
Wonder whether that's working, don't you?</i>

258
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:32,003
<i>Spoon, Jar. Jar, spoon.</i>

259
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,162
<i>Spoon, Jar.
Spoon, Jar. Jar, spoon.</i>

260
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,090
<i>Stop!</i>

261
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,682
<i>Stop!</i>

262
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,331
<i>Pull it. Pull it.</i>

263
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:18,969
Night.

264
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,010
You all right?

265
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:45,005
If you're frightened, let's go.

266
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,691
Come on.

267
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,162
It's all right.

268
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,124
That's it.

269
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,768
It's okay. it's okay.

270
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,089
It's okay.

271
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,164
It's okay.

272
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,283
All right.

273
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:08,449
Okay-

274
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:12,127
You did it.

275
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,445
You all right?

276
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:36,203
You just off for a ramble
in the woods then? Eh?

277
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:38,760
- Huh?
- You just off for a ramble in the woods?

278
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:42,640
Yeah, yeah? Oh, it's, uh-
Watch how you step here. it's a bit, uh-

279
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:45,690
it's a bit slippery round here,
but- this time of year.

280
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:50,288
It's all right in summer. Well, it's still wet
in summer, but not as bad as it is now.

281
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:52,806
But there's plenty of trails around here.

282
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,484
Have you been here before?

283
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,244
No? First time? Yeah?

284
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,641
Oh, you won't get lost.
They're all clearly marked.

285
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:01,883
But, uh, there's about 2,000 acres
of forest here...

286
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:06,010
so you shouldn't- you should have,
uh, plenty of places to go in there.

287
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,764
- You on your own?
- Yeah.

288
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:12,323
Yeah, on your own? Oh, well, it's a nice
place if you want some solitude...

289
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:16,371
you know, to “gather your thoughts”
and all that, yeah?

290
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:19,284
- So, uh, enjoy yourself anyway, okay?
- Thank you.
