what happened last night?

01:01:45,282 --> 01:01:47,382
Nothing.

795
01:01:47,384 --> 01:01:49,984
Tell me the truth.

796
01:01:49,986 --> 01:01:53,188
When will I see a real
sunrise, Vincent?

Before Mary was born,

799
01:02:02,265 --> 01:02:06,467
my wife and I used to go to
the coast for our holidays.

800
01:02:06,469 --> 01:02:10,205
And every morning we'd
sit on these cliffs...

801
01:02:10,207 --> 01:02:13,141
and watch the sun
rise over the sea.

802
01:02:15,477 --> 01:02:17,512
Sounds like happiness.

803
01:02:27,489 --> 01:02:29,390
What happened last night?

804
01:02:36,632 --> 01:02:38,433
I killed a man.

805
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:43,037
Why?

806
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:50,011
Why did you kill him?

(GUN BLAST)

808
01:02:55,284 --> 01:02:57,452
Because I didn't want to die.

VINCENT: We've created
something incredible.

810
01:03:07,964 --> 01:03:11,332
This machine has the potential to be
so much more than just a soldier.

811
01:03:11,334 --> 01:03:13,701
It's a few steps up from
my talking toaster.

812
01:03:13,703 --> 01:03:15,770
You think it's alive?
Give me some proof.

813
01:03:15,772 --> 01:03:17,672
In the meantime, I'll run
a few tests of my own.

814
01:03:17,674 --> 01:03:19,941
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait. What kind of tests?

815
01:03:19,943 --> 01:03:22,677
Look, if she is alive,
I have no idea how.

816
01:03:22,679 --> 01:03:26,214
If you mess her up in any way, I
don't know if I can get her back.

817
01:03:26,216 --> 01:03:28,483
Give me some proof
and I'll hold off.

820
01:03:49,139 --> 01:03:50,772
I see you.

821
01:03:50,774 --> 01:03:54,042
Your face, your
body, your clothes.

822
01:04:00,115 --> 01:04:03,284
Is Mary's illness the
reason you made me?

823
01:04:05,387 --> 01:04:06,955
Yes.

824

If you're alive, she
has a second chance.

But if you're
just a machine...

You know that. Don't you?

828
01:04:19,635 --> 01:04:21,703
I want to believe.

829
01:04:23,339 --> 01:04:24,939
But I need proof.

If you asked me to
trust you, I would.

When does she go into surgery?

We're going in now.
Because I love you.

angel of death, eh?

Even if you gave my

begin to scratch the surface of it.

If you want to change the programming,
you're gonna have to get Vincent to do it.

If you helped him make the
changes to the machine,

could you perform the same
operation on another machine?

Mary didn't make it
through the surgery.

Her lungs were severely
weakened by the infection.

dangerous that would be?

We barely understand
this prototype.

What happens when it designs
the next generation...

designs another?

They'd be so far advanced,
we'd be helpless against them.

They think you're too
human, too clever.

I lose my daughter forever.
