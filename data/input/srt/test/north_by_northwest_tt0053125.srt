00:02:16,691 --> 00:02:20,569
"Even if you accept the belief that a high
Trendex means a rising sales curve...."

4
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:22,113
-Mr. Thornhill?
-Good night, Eddie.

5
00:02:22,154 --> 00:02:24,616
-Say hello to the missus.
-We're not talking.

6
00:02:24,657 --> 00:02:26,617
"My recommendation is still the same.

7
00:02:26,702 --> 00:02:29,745
"Spread the good word in as many
small time segments as we can.

8
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,624
"Let the opposition have their high ratings
while we cry all the way to the bank.

00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:36,502
"Let's colonize at the Colony
one day next week for lunch.

10
00:02:36,585 --> 00:02:39,171
"Let me hear from you, Sam.
Happy thoughts, etc...."

11
00:02:39,255 --> 00:02:40,841
You better walk me to the Plaza.

12
00:02:40,923 --> 00:02:44,135
-I didn't put a coat on.
-Use your blood sugar, child. Come on.

13
00:02:44,218 --> 00:02:45,720
-Next?
-Gretchen Sabinson.

14
00:02:45,803 --> 00:02:46,513
Oh, yes.

15
00:02:46,595 --> 00:02:49,515
Send her a box of candy from Blum's.
$10. You know the kind.

16
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,144
Each piece wrapped in gold paper.
She'll think she's eating money.

17
00:02:53,227 --> 00:02:55,980
Just tell her:
"Darling, I count the days, the hours--"

18
00:02:56,022 --> 00:02:58,107
-You sent that one last time.
-I did?

19
00:02:58,149 --> 00:03:02,278
Put: "Something for your sweet tooth,
baby, and all your other sweet parts! "

20
00:03:02,486 --> 00:03:03,321
I know.

21
00:03:03,404 --> 00:03:04,655
Could we take a cab?

22
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,908
-For two blocks?
-You're late and I'm tired.

23
00:03:06,991 --> 00:03:09,660
That's your trouble, Maggie,
you don't eat properly.

24
00:03:09,745 --> 00:03:10,787
Here. Taxi.

25
00:03:11,871 --> 00:03:14,582
I have a very sick woman here.
You don't mind, do you?

26
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:15,875
Thank you very much.

27
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,460
Perfectly all right.

28
00:03:17,877 --> 00:03:20,172
First stop, the Plaza. Don't throw the flag.

29
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:21,214
Poor man.

30
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:25,593
I made him a happy man.
I made him feel like a good Samaritan.

31
00:03:25,677 --> 00:03:27,345
He knew you were lying.

32
00:03:28,596 --> 00:03:31,474
In the world of advertising,
there's no such thing as a lie.

33
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:34,977
There's only "the expedient exaggeration."
You ought to know that.

34
00:03:35,394 --> 00:03:37,355
Do I look heavyish to you?

35
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:38,356
What?

36
00:03:38,397 --> 00:03:39,774
I feel heavyish.

37
00:03:39,899 --> 00:03:42,568
Put a note on my desk in the morning:
"Think thin."

38
00:03:42,652 --> 00:03:43,944
"Think thin."

39
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,864
Better make it the 59th Street entrance.

40
00:03:46,906 --> 00:03:47,698
Okay.

41
00:03:48,741 --> 00:03:50,702
Soon as you get back, call my mother.

42
00:03:50,743 --> 00:03:53,162
Remind her we have theatre tickets
for tonight.

43
00:03:53,204 --> 00:03:55,039
Dinner at 21, 7:00.

44
00:03:55,164 --> 00:03:59,293
I'll have had two martini's at the Oak Bar
so she needn't bother to sniff my breath.

45
00:03:59,377 --> 00:04:02,172
-She doesn't do that.
-Sure she does. Like a bloodhound.

46
00:04:02,213 --> 00:04:06,008
Bigelow at 10:30 is your first for tomorrow.
The Skin Glow rehearsal's at noon.

47
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:08,010
Then lunch with Falcon and his wife.

48
00:04:08,094 --> 00:04:10,680
-Where was that?
-Larry and Arnold's, 1 :00.

49
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:13,599
-Will you check in later?
-Absolutely not.

50
00:04:15,017 --> 00:04:17,728
Here, Driver. Take this lady
back where she belongs.

51
00:04:17,813 --> 00:04:19,814
-Right.
-That ought to cover it.

52
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:23,109
-Don't forget, call my mother right away.
-I won't.

53
00:04:23,192 --> 00:04:25,903
-Good night, Mr. Thornhill.
-Good night.

54
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:31,784
Wait, Maggie! You can't call her.
She's at Mrs.--

55
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:55,516
Good evening, Mr. Thornhill.

56
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:58,020
I'm looking for Mr. Weltner
and two other gentlemen.

57
00:04:58,102 --> 00:04:59,812
Yes, sir. Right this way.

58
00:05:00,896 --> 00:05:01,647
Herman.

59
00:05:01,732 --> 00:05:03,441
-Hello, Roger.
-I'm a little late.

60
00:05:03,524 --> 00:05:05,276
Roger Thornhill. Fanning Nelson.

61
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:10,614
-We've gotten a head start here.
-That won't last long.

62
00:05:10,698 --> 00:05:15,119
I was saying that you may be slow
in starting, but there's nobody faster.

63
00:05:15,202 --> 00:05:17,372
What's the matter? You've got the fidgets.

64
00:05:17,455 --> 00:05:22,293
I told my secretary to call Mother and
I realized she won't be able to reach her.

65
00:05:22,543 --> 00:05:23,295
Why not?

66
00:05:23,377 --> 00:05:25,629
She's playing bridge at one of her cronies'.

67
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:27,381
-Your secretary?
-No. My mother.

68
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:28,383
Mr. Kaplan?

69
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:31,594
It's one of those new apartments,
wet paint and no telephone yet.

70
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:33,804
Perhaps if I send her a telegram.

71
00:05:33,846 --> 00:05:35,223
Mr. George Kaplan?

72
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:36,141
Boy!

73
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:42,688
Kaplan.

74
00:05:42,772 --> 00:05:44,273
I have to send a wire.

75
00:05:44,358 --> 00:05:46,818
Could you send it for me
if I write it out for you?

76
00:05:46,902 --> 00:05:49,987
I'm not permitted to do that, sir,
but if you'll follow me....

77
00:05:50,155 --> 00:05:52,323
-Will you excuse me?
-Go right ahead.

78
00:05:55,953 --> 00:05:57,787
-Right through there, sir.
-Thanks.

79
00:05:57,828 --> 00:05:59,163
Thank you, sir.

80
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,209
What's that supposed to be?

81
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:06,796
The car is waiting outside.
You'll walk between us saying nothing.

82
00:06:06,838 --> 00:06:09,174
-What are you talking about?
-Let's go.

83
00:06:09,465 --> 00:06:10,841
Go where? Who....

84
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:12,426
Who are you?

85
00:06:12,511 --> 00:06:14,721
Mere errand boys,
carrying concealed weapons.

86
00:06:14,804 --> 00:06:18,724
His is pointed at your heart, so, please,
no errors of judgment, I beg of you.

87
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:20,644
What is this? A joke or something?

88
00:06:20,685 --> 00:06:23,145
Yes, a joke. We'll laugh in the car.

89
00:06:23,354 --> 00:06:24,188
Come.

90
00:06:24,271 --> 00:06:25,732
This is ridiculous.

91
00:06:46,794 --> 00:06:49,840
Don't tell me where we're going.
Surprise me.

92
00:06:51,757 --> 00:06:54,510
I left some friends
back there in the Oak Bar.

93
00:06:54,552 --> 00:06:56,555
They'll think I'm awfully rude.

94
00:06:56,637 --> 00:06:59,558
Could we stop off
at a drugstore for a moment...

95
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,852
...so that I could explain
I'm being kidnapped?

96
00:07:04,062 --> 00:07:06,564
Well, that is what's happening, isn't it?

97
00:07:15,907 --> 00:07:16,950
Locked.

98
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:23,122
TOWNSEND

99
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,380
Who's Townsend?

100
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:34,800
Really?

101
00:07:35,594 --> 00:07:36,762
Interesting.

102
00:08:21,305 --> 00:08:23,308
-Where is he?
-Upstairs, dressing.

103
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:25,935
-Tell him I'm here.
-The dinner guests are expected.

104
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:28,063
Never mind that. Say to him: "Kaplan."

105
00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:30,481
By the way,
what are we having for dessert?

106
00:08:30,524 --> 00:08:32,234
-Is anyone in the library?
-No.

107
00:08:32,316 --> 00:08:33,317
This way.

108
00:08:44,997 --> 00:08:46,164
You will wait here.

109
00:08:46,248 --> 00:08:49,208
Don't hurry. I'll catch up on my reading.

110
00:09:08,645 --> 00:09:11,022
MR. LESTER TOWNSEND
169 BAYWOOD, GLEN COVE, N.Y.

111
00:09:32,044 --> 00:09:33,420
Good evening.

112
00:09:56,526 --> 00:09:58,946
Not what I expected. A little taller...

113
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:02,532
...a little more polished than the others.

114
00:10:03,492 --> 00:10:06,370
I'm so glad you're pleased, Mr. Townsend.

115
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,830
But, I'm afraid, just as obvious.

116
00:10:10,332 --> 00:10:13,210
What the devil is all this about?
Why was I brought here?

117
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:17,381
Games? Must we?

118
00:10:19,174 --> 00:10:23,679
Not that I mind a slight case of abduction,
but I have tickets for the theatre tonight.

119
00:10:23,762 --> 00:10:25,597
To a show I was looking forward to.

120
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:28,141
I get unreasonable about things like that.

121
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,353
With such expert play-acting,
you make this very room a theatre.

122
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:36,900
Leonard, have you met
our distinguished guest?

123
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:40,654
He's a well-tailored one, isn't he?

124
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:44,366
My secretary is a great admirer
of your methods, Mr. Kaplan.

125
00:10:44,783 --> 00:10:46,618
Elusiveness, however misguided--

126
00:10:46,702 --> 00:10:48,119
Wait a minute.

127
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,289
Did you call me "Kaplan"?

128
00:10:50,372 --> 00:10:54,751
I know you're a man of many names,
but I'll accept your current choice.

129
00:10:54,876 --> 00:10:56,128
Current choice?

130
00:10:56,295 --> 00:10:59,840
My name is Roger Thornhill.
It's never been anything else.

131
00:10:59,923 --> 00:11:01,133
Of course.

132
00:11:01,925 --> 00:11:05,845
Your friends picked up the wrong package
when they bundled me out here in the car.

133
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:07,723
Sit down, Mr. Kaplan.

134
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,018
I told you, I'm not Kaplan, whoever he is.

135
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:12,978
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

136
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,438
The guests are here, dear.

137
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:17,274
Look after them.
I'll be with you in a few minutes.

138
00:11:19,568 --> 00:11:21,695
Now, shall we get down to business?

139
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:22,863
I'm all for that.

140
00:11:22,946 --> 00:11:26,408
Simply, I'd like you to tell me
how much you know of our arrangements...

141
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:28,619
...and how you've come by
this information.

142
00:11:28,702 --> 00:11:31,330
-I don't expect to get this for nothing.
-Of course not.

143
00:11:31,413 --> 00:11:32,539
Don't misunderstand.

144
00:11:32,623 --> 00:11:35,208
I don't expect you to fall in
with the suggestion...

145
00:11:35,292 --> 00:11:39,671
...but the least I can do is afford you
the opportunity of surviving the evening.

146
00:11:43,008 --> 00:11:44,968
What is that supposed to mean?

147
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,763
Why don't you surprise me,
Mr. Kaplan, and say yes?

148
00:11:47,846 --> 00:11:48,972
I've told you--

149
00:11:49,014 --> 00:11:50,724
We know where you're headed for.

150
00:11:50,807 --> 00:11:54,186
I know where I'm headed.
The Winter Garden Theatre in New York.

151
00:11:54,227 --> 00:11:56,438
And I think I'd better get going.

152
00:12:04,988 --> 00:12:07,115
Townsend,
you're making a serious mistake.

153
00:12:07,616 --> 00:12:11,161
This is not going to lead
to a very happy conclusion, Mr. Kaplan.

154
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,871
I'm not Kaplan!

155
00:12:12,913 --> 00:12:14,581
I do wish you would reconsider.

156
00:12:14,664 --> 00:12:18,669
We also know your contact in Pittsburgh
since Jason committed suicide.

157
00:12:19,378 --> 00:12:22,422
What contact?
I've never been in Pittsburgh.

158
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,802
On June 16, you checked
into the Sherwyn Hotel in Pittsburgh...

159
00:12:26,885 --> 00:12:29,346
...as Mr. George Kaplan
of Berkeley, California.

160
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:32,390
A week later, you registered
at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel...

161
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:34,935
...in Philadelphia
as Mr. George Kaplan of Pittsburgh.

162
00:12:35,018 --> 00:12:37,229
On August 11,
you stayed at the Statler in Boston.

163
00:12:37,312 --> 00:12:41,358
On August 29, George Kaplan of Boston
registered at the Whittier in Detroit.

164
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,734
At present, you are registered
in Room 796...

165
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:47,406
...at the Plaza Hotel in New York
as Mr. George Kaplan of Detroit.

166
00:12:47,572 --> 00:12:51,285
In two days, you are due
at the Ambassador East in Chicago.

167
00:12:51,702 --> 00:12:55,289
And then at the Sheraton-Johnson Hotel
in Rapid City, South Dakota.

168
00:12:55,372 --> 00:12:56,123
Not me!

169
00:12:56,206 --> 00:12:59,293
There's no sense in maintaining
that you are deceiving us...

170
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,460
...any more than we are deceiving you.

171
00:13:01,545 --> 00:13:04,673
I suppose it wouldn't do any good
to show you ID cards...

172
00:13:04,756 --> 00:13:06,633
...a driver's license, things like that?

173
00:13:06,717 --> 00:13:08,635
They provide you with such good ones.

174
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,847
It's getting late. I have guests.

175
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:15,934
Do you intend to cooperate with us?
I'd like a simple yes or no.

176
00:13:16,058 --> 00:13:17,269
A simple no.

177
00:13:17,436 --> 00:13:21,440
For the simple reason that I simply
don't know what you're talking about.

178
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,446
Give Mr. Kaplan a drink, Leonard.

179
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:29,364
A pleasant journey, sir.

180
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,251
Scotch? Rye?

181
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:44,129
Bourbon? Vodka?

182
00:13:44,713 --> 00:13:47,049
Nothing. I'll take a quick ride
back to town.

183
00:13:47,132 --> 00:13:48,800
That has been arranged.

184
00:13:48,884 --> 00:13:51,303
But first, a libation.

185
00:13:52,596 --> 00:13:53,596
Bourbon!

186
00:13:54,264 --> 00:13:57,184
You drink it.
I've had enough stimulation for one day.

187
00:13:57,267 --> 00:14:01,688
It'll be easier if you take this yourself.
Otherwise, we'll have to insist.

188
00:14:15,994 --> 00:14:17,037
Cheers!

189
00:15:05,794 --> 00:15:07,921
Don't worry about me. I'll take the bus.

190
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:01,302
Thanks for the lift.

191
00:18:01,386 --> 00:18:04,222
I want this man examined for driving
while intoxicated.

192
00:18:04,264 --> 00:18:05,349
Really?

193
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,684
You see, they tried to kill me.

194
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:09,561
He won't listen to me.

195
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:11,937
In a big house. They tried to kill me.

196
00:18:12,022 --> 00:18:15,150
-All right. Let's just go inside.
-I don't want to go inside.

197
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:16,651
Somebody call the police.

198
00:18:16,735 --> 00:18:18,320
Come on. Come on now.

199
00:18:19,112 --> 00:18:20,197
Okay.

200
00:18:28,913 --> 00:18:30,082
Sit down.

201
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,583
I don't want to sit.

202
00:18:33,084 --> 00:18:34,836
Perfectly all right. See?

203
00:18:35,212 --> 00:18:39,216
We'll get 'em. We'll throw the book
at them. Assault and kidnapping.

204
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:41,967
Assault with a gun and a bourbon
and a sports car.

205
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:43,053
We'll get 'em.

206
00:18:43,095 --> 00:18:46,807
You'll be fine after a good night's sleep.
We got a nice cell all made up.

207
00:18:46,932 --> 00:18:49,059
I don't want a cell. I want a policeman.

208
00:18:49,142 --> 00:18:51,270
The car was just reported stolen.

209
00:18:52,521 --> 00:18:54,648
A Mrs. Babson up on Twining Road.

210
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:57,566
I got to call someone. Where's the phone?

211
00:18:57,608 --> 00:18:59,278
You're allowed one call.

212
00:18:59,778 --> 00:19:00,904
Over here.

213
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:02,072
Thanks.

214
00:19:02,572 --> 00:19:04,950
You better make it your lawyer.

215
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:07,661
Butterfield 8-1-0-9-8.

216
00:19:07,869 --> 00:19:09,913
What am l, a telephone operator?

217
00:19:09,997 --> 00:19:11,748
Butterfield 8-1-0-9-8.

218
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:26,680
Just a minute, please.

219
00:19:26,762 --> 00:19:28,347
-Here.
-Thank you.

220
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:32,060
Hello, Mother?

221
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,814
Mother, this is your son, Roger Thornhill.

222
00:19:38,358 --> 00:19:40,277
Wait a minute, I'll find out.

223
00:19:41,028 --> 00:19:42,279
Where am l?

224
00:19:42,321 --> 00:19:44,364
Glen Cove Police Station.

225
00:19:44,989 --> 00:19:47,159
Glen Cove Police Station.

226
00:19:49,077 --> 00:19:51,537
No, Mother, I have not been drinking.

227
00:19:51,787 --> 00:19:56,293
No, these two men, they poured
a whole bottle of bourbon into me.

228
00:19:57,793 --> 00:19:59,879
No, they didn't give me a chaser.

229
00:20:01,506 --> 00:20:03,175
Come on, let's go.

230
00:20:04,676 --> 00:20:07,678
-Wait, I'm not finished yet.
-Yes, you are. Come on.

231
00:20:08,138 --> 00:20:10,891
Mother, I got to go now.

232
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:14,019
Get my lawyer right away
and come and bail me out.

233
00:20:14,102 --> 00:20:16,020
Tomorrow morning, tell her.

234
00:20:16,312 --> 00:20:18,023
Tomorrow morning, he says.

235
00:20:19,358 --> 00:20:20,651
I don't know. I'll ask him.

236
00:20:20,692 --> 00:20:22,486
She wants to know who says.

237
00:20:22,526 --> 00:20:24,403
Sergeant Emil Klinger.

238
00:20:24,738 --> 00:20:26,238
Sergeant Emil....

239
00:20:26,823 --> 00:20:27,824
Emil?

240
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:31,286
Sergeant Emil Klinger.

241
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:34,998
No. I didn't believe it either.

242
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,378
I'm all right, Mother. Good night.

243
00:20:44,383 --> 00:20:45,758
That was Mother.

244
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:47,593
Let's go.

245
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,019
Here's your man, Doctor.

246
00:20:59,313 --> 00:21:00,356
What's your name?

247
00:21:00,606 --> 00:21:02,149
Roger Thornhill.

248
00:21:02,401 --> 00:21:04,486
Stick out your tongue and say: "ah."

249
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:06,112
You better move back.

250
00:21:08,073 --> 00:21:09,616
Have you been drinking?

251
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,743
Doctor, I am gassed.

252
00:21:12,368 --> 00:21:13,704
What were you drinking?

253
00:21:13,745 --> 00:21:15,956
Well, bourbon. See, these two fellas--

254
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:18,709
-How much would you say you drank?
-What?

255
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,003
-How much would you say you drank?
-About this much.

256
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:26,341
Mr. Thornhill, my opinion
is that you are definitely intoxicated.

257
00:21:26,424 --> 00:21:27,634
No question about it.

258
00:21:27,717 --> 00:21:29,886
I won't ask your permission to draw blood.

259
00:21:29,928 --> 00:21:30,971
How disgusting!

260
00:21:31,054 --> 00:21:33,557
"You may refuse to permit a blood test
to be made...

261
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,143
"...but if you do,
your license will be revoked."

262
00:21:38,478 --> 00:21:41,772
It was at this point
that Mr. Thornhill succeeded in escaping...

263
00:21:41,814 --> 00:21:44,900
...from his would-be assassins,
and when they gave chase...

264
00:21:44,985 --> 00:21:49,071
...he, naturally, had to drive
as best he could under the circumstances.

265
00:21:50,324 --> 00:21:51,949
How long have you known your client?

266
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,577
Seven years, Your Honor.

267
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:55,787
Do you know him to be a reasonable man?

268
00:21:56,038 --> 00:21:57,331
Absolutely.

269
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,291
Mother!

270
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:03,461
Do you believe there is some credence
to this story?

271
00:22:03,961 --> 00:22:04,838
Credence!

272
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:08,008
Yes, Your Honor. If my client says
this is what happened...

273
00:22:08,132 --> 00:22:09,967
...I'm certain it must've happened.

274
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:10,927
Damn right.

275
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:15,390
I want this turned over
to the County Detectives for investigation.

276
00:22:15,474 --> 00:22:17,726
Call them and have them
come here immediately.

277
00:22:17,808 --> 00:22:18,894
Right, Your Honor.

278
00:22:18,977 --> 00:22:23,732
Counselor, I'm going to set this over
for final disposition tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.

279
00:22:24,483 --> 00:22:28,111
I expect you and the defendant to be here,
ready to go to trial.

280
00:22:28,153 --> 00:22:32,324
In the meantime, the County Detectives'll
determine if his story has any basis in fact.

281
00:22:33,241 --> 00:22:36,995
"Basis in fact"? lf I were brought in dead,
you still wouldn't believe--

282
00:22:37,036 --> 00:22:38,038
Wait a minute.

283
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,998
After all, Your Honor,
would I make up such a story?

284
00:22:41,248 --> 00:22:44,877
That is precisely what were intending
to find out, Mr. Thornhill.

285
00:23:04,231 --> 00:23:05,399
Remember me?

286
00:23:05,524 --> 00:23:06,900
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

287
00:23:06,984 --> 00:23:10,487
-Is Mr. Townsend at home?
-No, I'm sorry he's left for the day.

288
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:11,780
Mrs. Townsend?

289
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:15,492
-Who shall I say is calling?
-County Detectives.

290
00:23:15,534 --> 00:23:17,035
Come in, please.

291
00:23:27,045 --> 00:23:28,588
This way, please.

292
00:23:39,016 --> 00:23:40,391
This is the room.

293
00:23:40,475 --> 00:23:41,684
I'll call Madam.

294
00:23:41,726 --> 00:23:42,727
You do that.

295
00:23:42,768 --> 00:23:44,854
Here's the sofa where they held me down.

296
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:48,191
They spilled bourbon all over it.
I'll show you the stains.

297
00:23:50,902 --> 00:23:53,030
Somebody must've cleaned them off.

298
00:23:53,405 --> 00:23:55,823
This is the cabinet
where they keep the liquor.

299
00:23:55,907 --> 00:23:57,534
Scotch, gin, vodka....

300
00:23:59,494 --> 00:24:00,787
And bourbon.

301
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,792
I remember when it used to come
in bottles.

302
00:24:10,047 --> 00:24:13,425
Dear, we were so worried about you!

303
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:15,927
Did you get home all right?

304
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:17,095
Of course you did.

305
00:24:17,178 --> 00:24:20,682
Let me look at you.
A little pink-eyed, but aren't we all?

306
00:24:20,766 --> 00:24:23,434
It was a dull party.
You didn't miss a thing.

307
00:24:23,852 --> 00:24:27,731
I want you all to know,
I never saw this woman before last night.

308
00:24:27,855 --> 00:24:30,943
Mrs. Townsend, I'm Capt. Junket
of the Nassau County Detectives.

309
00:24:31,026 --> 00:24:32,235
This is Lt. Harding.

310
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:36,197
You haven't gotten into trouble, Roger?

311
00:24:36,281 --> 00:24:38,783
-Stop calling me Roger.
-Has he gotten into trouble?

312
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:43,288
Mr. Thornhill was picked up last night
driving under the influence of alcohol...

313
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,207
...incidentally, in a stolen car...

314
00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:46,249
Stolen car!

315
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:48,794
...belonging to Mrs. Babson
of Twining Road.

316
00:24:48,877 --> 00:24:51,295
Roger, you said you were going
to call a cab.

317
00:24:51,337 --> 00:24:53,757
You didn't borrow Laura's Mercedes?

318
00:24:53,966 --> 00:24:56,300
No, I didn't borrow Laura's Mercedes!

319
00:24:56,468 --> 00:25:00,847
Mr. Thornhill has told us that he was
brought here against his will last night...

320
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:05,769
...and forcibly intoxicated by some friends
of your husband and set out on the road.

321
00:25:05,811 --> 00:25:07,854
Do you know anything about this?

322
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,817
Roger was a bit tipsy
when he arrived here by cab for dinner.

323
00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:12,818
She's lying.

324
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:16,280
And I'm afraid he became even worse
as the evening wore on.

325
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,574
Finally, he told us he had to go home
to sleep it off.

326
00:25:19,699 --> 00:25:22,160
I knew I should've served dinner earlier.

327
00:25:22,244 --> 00:25:23,704
What a performance!

328
00:25:23,996 --> 00:25:27,499
Mrs. Townsend, does the name
George Kaplan mean anything to you?

329
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:28,874
George Kaplan?

330
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:31,503
-No.
-I didn't think so.

331
00:25:32,421 --> 00:25:35,299
Where's her husband?
He's the one you should be questioning.

332
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:37,134
Is there any place he can be reached?

333
00:25:37,174 --> 00:25:39,010
Yes. The United Nations.

334
00:25:41,137 --> 00:25:44,016
He's addressing the General Assembly
this afternoon.

335
00:25:46,101 --> 00:25:48,644
All right. So he's addressing
the General Assembly.

336
00:25:48,686 --> 00:25:51,522
-Sorry we had to bother you.
-No bother at all.

337
00:25:54,692 --> 00:25:56,403
Now, wait a minute.

338
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:05,037
Do you want to get in touch
with my husband, Captain?

339
00:26:05,077 --> 00:26:07,413
No, Mrs. Townsend,
that won't be necessary.

340
00:26:07,497 --> 00:26:10,541
Do you mean you're not going
to do any more about this?

341
00:26:11,543 --> 00:26:13,378
Pay the two dollars.

342
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:30,144
Goodbye.

343
00:26:57,339 --> 00:27:01,093
-I don't see why you want me along.
-You lend a certain air of respectability.

344
00:27:01,176 --> 00:27:02,927
Don't be sarcastic, Roger.

345
00:27:14,314 --> 00:27:16,817
There you are, dear. Park yourself there.

346
00:27:17,234 --> 00:27:18,609
Well, here it goes.

347
00:27:19,695 --> 00:27:20,779
Hello, Operator.

348
00:27:20,862 --> 00:27:23,448
Have you got a George Kaplan
staying here?

349
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,201
That's right.

350
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:27,911
You have?

351
00:27:28,036 --> 00:27:29,329
Room 796.

352
00:27:30,414 --> 00:27:32,123
Ring it, will you please?

353
00:27:32,457 --> 00:27:34,250
-You see?
-I see.

354
00:27:34,334 --> 00:27:38,129
I hope he clears up this silly business.
You're ruining my whole day.

355
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:42,509
Did he leave word when he'd be back?

356
00:27:43,677 --> 00:27:44,803
Really?

357
00:27:45,137 --> 00:27:46,262
Thank you.

358
00:27:47,347 --> 00:27:50,433
That's odd. He hasn't answered
his telephone in two days.

359
00:27:50,517 --> 00:27:52,476
Maybe he got locked in the bathroom.

360
00:27:52,518 --> 00:27:54,521
Mother, do me a favor, will you?

361
00:27:54,646 --> 00:27:59,109
Put on that innocent look you do so well
and go to the desk and get the key to 796.

362
00:27:59,192 --> 00:28:00,986
I wouldn't do such a thing!

363
00:28:01,068 --> 00:28:03,363
-$10?
-Not for all the money in the world.

364
00:28:03,488 --> 00:28:05,907
-$50?
-Roger, you are disgraceful.

365
00:28:10,662 --> 00:28:14,791
Car theft, drunk driving,
assaulting an officer, lying to a judge...

366
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:16,751
...and now, house-breaking.

367
00:28:16,835 --> 00:28:20,129
-No, hotel-breaking. There's a difference.
-Of five to ten years.

368
00:28:20,172 --> 00:28:21,548
Just a minute, please.

369
00:28:24,176 --> 00:28:26,803
Will you be wanting me
to change your bedding, sir?

370
00:28:26,845 --> 00:28:28,847
Yes. Well, but not right now.

371
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:32,225
I mention it, because the bed
doesn't seem like it's been slept in...

372
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:35,354
...and I was wondering
if I ought to change the linens.

373
00:28:35,478 --> 00:28:37,313
Thank you for your interest.

374
00:28:38,856 --> 00:28:39,858
Come on.

375
00:28:43,528 --> 00:28:45,655
She seemed to think I'm Kaplan.

376
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:48,492
I wonder if I look like Kaplan.

377
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:01,380
-Look who's here.
-Who? Where?

378
00:29:01,713 --> 00:29:05,258
Our friend who's assembling
the General Assembly this afternoon.

379
00:29:05,716 --> 00:29:07,551
Roger, I think we should go.

380
00:29:07,886 --> 00:29:08,929
Don't be nervous.

381
00:29:09,012 --> 00:29:13,057
-I'm not. I'll be late for the bridge club.
-Good. You'll lose less than usual.

382
00:29:28,115 --> 00:29:30,826
Bulletin, Kaplan has dandruff.

383
00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:32,868
In that case, I think we should leave.

384
00:29:32,911 --> 00:29:34,079
Too late.

385
00:29:39,584 --> 00:29:42,587
-You rang for me, sir?
-Yes. Come in for a moment.

386
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,881
-What's your name?
-Elsie, sir.

387
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:51,138
-Do you know who I am?
-You're Mr. Kaplan.

388
00:29:51,972 --> 00:29:54,473
When did you first see me?

389
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,934
Outside the door.

390
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,729
Out in the hall a couple of minutes ago.
Don't you remember?

391
00:29:59,771 --> 00:30:01,982
Is that the first time you laid eyes on me?

392
00:30:02,064 --> 00:30:04,484
Can I help it if you're never around,
Mr. Kaplan?

393
00:30:04,568 --> 00:30:06,570
Then how do you know I'm Mr. Kaplan?

394
00:30:06,653 --> 00:30:08,821
-What?
-How do you know I'm Mr. Kaplan?

395
00:30:08,905 --> 00:30:10,324
Of course you are.

396
00:30:10,406 --> 00:30:12,159
This is Room 796, isn't it?

397
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:15,287
So, you're the gentleman in Room 796,
aren't you?

398
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,789
All right, Elsie, thanks.

399
00:30:17,873 --> 00:30:20,667
-Will that be all, sir?
-For the time being, yes.

400
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,590
Valet.

401
00:30:27,716 --> 00:30:28,924
Yes, come in.

402
00:30:30,135 --> 00:30:33,263
-Should I hang it in the closet, Mr. Kaplan?
-Yes, please.

403
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,687
Tell me....

404
00:30:40,979 --> 00:30:43,357
What time did I give you that suit?

405
00:30:44,483 --> 00:30:46,485
Last night. Around 6:00.

406
00:30:47,527 --> 00:30:50,155
-Did I give it to you personally?
-Personally?

407
00:30:50,237 --> 00:30:53,784
No. You called down on the phone
and described the suit to me.

408
00:30:53,867 --> 00:30:57,162
Said it would be hanging in your closet.
Like you always do.

409
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,957
-Anything wrong?
-No, I'm just curious.

410
00:31:00,414 --> 00:31:02,167
-Here. Thanks.
-Thank you.

411
00:31:02,584 --> 00:31:04,503
Nice to meet you, Mr. Kaplan.

412
00:31:08,924 --> 00:31:10,759
Isn't that the damnedest thing?

413
00:31:10,841 --> 00:31:14,346
I'm beginning to think that no one
in the hotel has actually seen Kaplan.

414
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:17,432
Maybe he has his suits mended
by invisible weavers.

415
00:31:23,604 --> 00:31:25,148
Let me see something.

416
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:34,031
I don't think that one does
anything for you.

417
00:31:39,329 --> 00:31:40,747
Now, that's much better.

418
00:31:41,581 --> 00:31:44,876
Obviously they've mistaken me
for a much shorter man.

419
00:31:49,213 --> 00:31:51,133
-Should l?
-Certainly not.

420
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,344
Hold that.

421
00:31:59,098 --> 00:32:01,602
It's good to find you in, Mr. Kaplan.

422
00:32:01,976 --> 00:32:03,186
Who is this?

423
00:32:03,227 --> 00:32:06,440
We met only last night and still
you do not recognize my voice.

424
00:32:06,523 --> 00:32:08,441
I should feel offended.

425
00:32:08,692 --> 00:32:11,903
Yes, I know who you are
and I'm not Mr. Kaplan.

426
00:32:12,237 --> 00:32:15,866
Of course not. You answer his telephone,
you live in his hotel room...

427
00:32:15,949 --> 00:32:18,117
...and yet you are not Mr. Kaplan.

428
00:32:18,201 --> 00:32:20,912
Nevertheless,
we are pleased to find you in.

429
00:32:21,913 --> 00:32:23,123
Now wait....

430
00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:25,916
Operator?

431
00:32:26,668 --> 00:32:29,921
Operator, this is Mr. Thorn....
Kaplan in 796.

432
00:32:30,255 --> 00:32:33,884
Where did that call come from?
From the outside or from the lobby?

433
00:32:33,925 --> 00:32:36,428
-Just a minute. I'll see.
-Hurry, please.

434
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,471
Who was it?

435
00:32:37,596 --> 00:32:39,931
One of the men
who tried to kill me last night.

436
00:32:39,973 --> 00:32:41,642
We're back to that one, are we?

437
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:47,189
-That call was made from the lobby, sir.
-It was?

438
00:32:47,898 --> 00:32:50,067
They're probably on their way up here.

439
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:53,695
-Let's get out of here.
-I think I'd like to meet these killers.

440
00:33:37,739 --> 00:33:40,992
You gentlemen aren't really trying
to kill my son, are you?

441
00:34:04,223 --> 00:34:06,267
Lobby, please. Watch your step.

442
00:34:07,185 --> 00:34:10,564
Gentlemen, please. Ladies first.
Come along, ladies.

443
00:34:10,647 --> 00:34:12,608
That's right. Come along. Good.

444
00:34:14,108 --> 00:34:16,069
Roger, will you be home for dinner?

445
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:22,618
-Where to?
-I don't know. Just keep going.

446
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:41,178
-Take me to the United Nations.
-Right.

447
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,971
General Assembly Building.

448
00:34:43,054 --> 00:34:44,056
Right.

449
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:47,059
-I'm being followed. Can you do anything?
-Yes, I can.

450
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:47,643
Do it.

451
00:35:20,926 --> 00:35:22,552
-May I help you?
-Yes, please.

452
00:35:22,636 --> 00:35:24,762
Where will I find Mr. Lester Townsend?

453
00:35:24,846 --> 00:35:27,098
Mr. Lester Townsend of UNIPO?

454
00:35:27,474 --> 00:35:29,768
Did you have an appointment, sir?

455
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:32,229
Well, yes. He expects me.

456
00:35:32,271 --> 00:35:33,854
Your name, please?

457
00:35:33,939 --> 00:35:35,565
-My name?
-Yes, please.

458
00:35:36,273 --> 00:35:37,858
Kaplan. George Kaplan.

459
00:35:40,236 --> 00:35:41,905
One moment, please.

460
00:35:47,868 --> 00:35:49,954
Wait for me at the corner of 47th.

461
00:35:57,294 --> 00:36:01,424
If you'd give this to one of the attendants
in the public lounge, she'll page him.

462
00:36:01,507 --> 00:36:04,344
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome, Mr. Kaplan.

463
00:36:26,824 --> 00:36:28,951
Page Mr. Lester Townsend, please?

464
00:36:29,035 --> 00:36:30,912
Certainly, Mr. Kaplan.

465
00:36:31,162 --> 00:36:32,788
Mr. Townsend of UNIPO.

466
00:36:32,872 --> 00:36:34,749
Mr. Townsend of UNIPO.

467
00:36:34,874 --> 00:36:38,544
Please call at the communications desk
of the Public Lounge.

468
00:36:47,511 --> 00:36:48,721
You paged me?

469
00:36:48,971 --> 00:36:50,348
-Mr. Kaplan?
-Yes.

470
00:36:50,389 --> 00:36:53,601
You wanted to see Mr. Townsend.
This is Mr. Townsend.

471
00:36:53,684 --> 00:36:55,519
How do you do, Mr. Kaplan?

472
00:36:55,978 --> 00:36:57,772
This isn't Mr. Townsend.

473
00:36:57,897 --> 00:36:59,190
Yes, it is.

474
00:37:00,191 --> 00:37:02,736
There must be some mistake.
Mr. Lester Townsend?

475
00:37:02,818 --> 00:37:05,322
That's me. What can I do for you?

476
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,369
Are you the Townsend
who lives in Glen Cove?

477
00:37:11,452 --> 00:37:13,704
That's right. Are we neighbors?

478
00:37:14,664 --> 00:37:17,667
A large, red-brick house
with a curved, tree-lined driveway?

479
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:19,210
That's the one.

480
00:37:20,211 --> 00:37:22,088
Were you at home last night?

481
00:37:22,171 --> 00:37:23,964
-You mean in Glen Cove?
-Yes.

482
00:37:24,048 --> 00:37:26,884
I've been staying in my apartment
in town for the last month.

483
00:37:26,926 --> 00:37:29,304
I always do when we're in session here.

484
00:37:29,387 --> 00:37:30,805
What about Mrs. Townsend?

485
00:37:31,305 --> 00:37:33,766
My wife has been dead for many years.

486
00:37:33,891 --> 00:37:36,018
Mr. Kaplan, what's this all about?

487
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:38,729
Who are those people living in your house?

488
00:37:38,813 --> 00:37:41,275
What people?
The house is completely closed up.

489
00:37:41,732 --> 00:37:44,694
There's just a gardener and his wife
living on the grounds.

490
00:37:44,735 --> 00:37:47,405
Now, Mr. Kaplan, tell me who you are
and what you want.

491
00:37:52,576 --> 00:37:54,203
Do you know this man?

492
00:38:02,461 --> 00:38:03,462
Look!

493
00:38:08,217 --> 00:38:09,719
He's got a knife! Look out!

494
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,304
Listen to me.
I had nothing to do with this.

495
00:38:12,638 --> 00:38:15,057
-Call the police.
-Don't come any nearer!

496
00:38:15,224 --> 00:38:16,183
Get back!

497
00:38:32,158 --> 00:38:35,244
UNITED STATES INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

498
00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:38,998
"The photograph has been identified
as that of Roger Thornhill...

499
00:38:39,081 --> 00:38:43,837
"...a Manhattan advertising executive,
indicating that the name George Kaplan...

500
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:47,214
"...which he gave to an attendant
in the General Assembly Building...

501
00:38:47,298 --> 00:38:48,550
"...was false.

502
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,928
"A possible motive for the slaying
was suggested by the discovery...

503
00:38:53,263 --> 00:38:57,099
"...that earlier today, Thornhill appeared
in a Glen Cove police court...

504
00:38:57,141 --> 00:39:00,269
"...charged with drunk driving
with a stolen car...

505
00:39:01,312 --> 00:39:04,815
"...and in his defense he charged
that the murder victim, Mr. Townsend...

506
00:39:04,899 --> 00:39:07,485
"...had tried to kill him the night before."

507
00:39:07,652 --> 00:39:08,611
Brother!

508
00:39:08,904 --> 00:39:10,321
What about that?

509
00:39:11,155 --> 00:39:13,491
Does anyone know this Thornhill?

510
00:39:14,033 --> 00:39:15,118
No, not me.

511
00:39:15,201 --> 00:39:16,452
Never heard of him.

512
00:39:16,994 --> 00:39:18,037
Professor?

513
00:39:18,204 --> 00:39:21,791
Apparently, the poor sucker got mistaken
for George Kaplan.

514
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:25,587
How could he be mistaken for
George Kaplan when he doesn't even exist?

515
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:28,964
Don't ask me how it happened,
but obviously it happened.

516
00:39:29,006 --> 00:39:32,844
Vandamm's men must have grabbed him
and tried to put him away...

517
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,930
...using Lester Townsend's house.

518
00:39:35,012 --> 00:39:38,349
And the unsuspecting Townsend winds up
with a stray knife in his back.

519
00:39:39,517 --> 00:39:41,060
C'est la guerre.

520
00:39:41,352 --> 00:39:43,980
It's so horribly sad.
Why is it I feel like laughing?

521
00:39:44,063 --> 00:39:45,773
What are we going to do?

522
00:39:45,856 --> 00:39:46,732
Do?

523
00:39:47,024 --> 00:39:48,818
About Mr. Thornhill?

524
00:39:49,485 --> 00:39:51,988
We...do nothing!

525
00:39:53,114 --> 00:39:53,823
Nothing?

526
00:39:54,198 --> 00:39:55,784
That's right. Nothing.

527
00:39:56,409 --> 00:40:00,497
We could congratulate ourselves
on a marvelous stroke of good fortune.

528
00:40:01,706 --> 00:40:05,835
Our non-existent decoy, George Kaplan,
created to divert suspicion...

529
00:40:05,876 --> 00:40:09,839
...from our actual agent,
has fortuitously become a live decoy.

530
00:40:09,922 --> 00:40:11,382
Yes, Professor.

531
00:40:11,466 --> 00:40:13,843
How long do you think he'll stay alive?

532
00:40:14,802 --> 00:40:16,429
That's his problem.

533
00:40:16,554 --> 00:40:18,223
What Mrs. Finley means--

534
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:19,724
I know what she means.

535
00:40:19,808 --> 00:40:23,019
We can't sit back calmly and wait to see
who kills him first!

536
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,062
Vandamm and company or the police?

537
00:40:26,397 --> 00:40:29,859
What can we do to save him
without endangering our own agent?

538
00:40:30,193 --> 00:40:32,695
Aren't we being just a wee bit callous?

539
00:40:32,945 --> 00:40:35,531
No, my dear woman,
we're not being callous.

540
00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:40,120
We didn't invent our non-existent man
and give him the name of George Kaplan...

541
00:40:40,202 --> 00:40:43,205
...establish elaborate behavior patterns
for him...

542
00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:47,877
...move his prop belongings in and out
of hotel rooms, for our private amusement.

543
00:40:48,753 --> 00:40:50,547
We created George Kaplan...

544
00:40:50,671 --> 00:40:53,175
...and labored successfully
to convince Vandamm...

545
00:40:53,257 --> 00:40:57,219
...that this was our agent hot on his trail
for a desperately important reason.

546
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,555
Nobody's denying that!

547
00:40:59,764 --> 00:41:00,931
Very well, then.

548
00:41:01,015 --> 00:41:05,519
If we make the slightest move to suggest
there's no such agent as George Kaplan...

549
00:41:05,603 --> 00:41:10,066
...give any hint to Vandamm he's pursuing
a decoy instead of our own agent...

550
00:41:10,107 --> 00:41:13,487
...then our agent, working right under
Vandamm's very nose...

551
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,739
...will immediately face suspicion,
exposure...

552
00:41:17,406 --> 00:41:19,033
...and assassination.

553
00:41:20,326 --> 00:41:22,203
Like the two others who went before.

554
00:41:22,495 --> 00:41:25,623
Goodbye, Mr. Thornhill, wherever you are.

555
00:41:34,215 --> 00:41:36,509
Train number 25...

556
00:41:37,093 --> 00:41:40,221
...the 20th Century Limited...

557
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:45,434
...due to leave in 6:00 p.m. for Chicago....

558
00:41:50,482 --> 00:41:51,983
Yes, dear. I know.

559
00:41:52,441 --> 00:41:55,569
Now, listen to me, Mother,
I called the Plaza.

560
00:41:55,987 --> 00:41:59,240
Kaplan checked out and went
to the Ambassador East in Chicago.

561
00:41:59,323 --> 00:42:00,741
That's why I'm--

562
00:42:01,492 --> 00:42:04,120
I can't go to the police. At least not yet.

563
00:42:04,245 --> 00:42:07,039
You saw the newspapers.
My fingerprints are on the knife.

564
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:10,209
I'm a car thief, a drunk driver,
and a murderer.

565
00:42:10,376 --> 00:42:11,878
I wouldn't have a chance.

566
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:16,632
I won't have, until I find George Kaplan
who obviously knows what this is about.

567
00:42:16,799 --> 00:42:18,801
No, the train. It's safer.

568
00:42:19,468 --> 00:42:23,431
Because there's no place to hide on a plane
if anyone should recognize me.

569
00:42:24,265 --> 00:42:26,684
You want me to jump off a moving plane?

570
00:42:27,977 --> 00:42:30,647
Well, thank you so much, Mother.
Goodbye.

571
00:42:44,535 --> 00:42:46,329
MANHUNT ON FOR U. N. KILLER

572
00:43:09,728 --> 00:43:12,271
Give me a bedroom
on the 20th Century, please.

573
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:13,899
It's leaving in five minutes.

574
00:43:13,981 --> 00:43:15,733
I know. Will you make it snappy?

575
00:43:15,816 --> 00:43:17,735
I think they're all sold out.

576
00:43:17,902 --> 00:43:18,819
Sold out?

577
00:43:18,903 --> 00:43:20,571
You can always go coach.

578
00:43:20,738 --> 00:43:23,407
No, I can't do that.
What time is the next train?

579
00:43:23,491 --> 00:43:26,453
Nothing till 10:00. You're in a hurry, huh?

580
00:43:27,161 --> 00:43:29,705
Could you call them
and see what they have?

581
00:43:29,747 --> 00:43:31,415
Something wrong with your eyes?

582
00:43:31,499 --> 00:43:34,627
Yes, they're sensitive to questions.
Will you call them?

583
00:43:34,795 --> 00:43:36,128
Sure. Sure.

584
00:43:39,298 --> 00:43:40,299
Don't go away!

585
00:43:49,809 --> 00:43:52,521
He's at Window 15, upper level. Hurry.

586
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,232
You're in luck, mister.

587
00:44:03,572 --> 00:44:06,076
-Ticket?
-I'm just seeing some friends off.

588
00:44:07,868 --> 00:44:09,412
I have to know their names.

589
00:44:10,496 --> 00:44:11,664
Come here!

590
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,114
I'm sorry.

591
00:44:45,157 --> 00:44:46,949
-I'm sorry.
-My fault.

592
00:44:47,992 --> 00:44:48,993
Sorry.

593
00:44:58,586 --> 00:45:00,671
He went that way. I think he got off.

594
00:45:01,422 --> 00:45:02,923
All aboard!

595
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:09,013
-Thank you.
-Quite all right.

596
00:45:09,055 --> 00:45:10,931
Seven parking tickets.

597
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,930
-Good evening, sir. One?
-Please.

598
00:46:47,069 --> 00:46:48,487
A cocktail before dinner?

599
00:46:48,571 --> 00:46:50,782
-Yes, please. A Gibson.
-Right away.

600
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:01,917
Here we are again.

601
00:47:02,752 --> 00:47:03,669
Yes.

602
00:47:05,671 --> 00:47:07,006
You recommend anything?

603
00:47:07,089 --> 00:47:10,760
The brook trout.
A little "trouty" but quite good.

604
00:47:11,637 --> 00:47:12,595
Sold.

605
00:47:14,806 --> 00:47:16,098
"Brook...

606
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:17,392
"...trout."

607
00:47:17,975 --> 00:47:19,685
-There you are.
-Yes, sir.

608
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:33,866
I know. I look vaguely familiar.

609
00:47:33,949 --> 00:47:34,867
Yes.

610
00:47:35,326 --> 00:47:37,704
You feel you've seen me
somewhere before.

611
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:42,417
I have that effect on people.
It's something about my face.

612
00:47:43,751 --> 00:47:45,336
It's a nice face.

613
00:47:46,295 --> 00:47:49,256
-You think so?
-I wouldn't say it if I didn't.

614
00:47:50,132 --> 00:47:51,926
Oh, you're that type.

615
00:47:52,009 --> 00:47:53,094
What type?

616
00:47:53,469 --> 00:47:54,512
Honest.

617
00:47:55,179 --> 00:47:56,180
Not really.

618
00:47:56,931 --> 00:47:59,308
Good. Because honest women
frighten me.

619
00:47:59,392 --> 00:48:00,351
Why?

620
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:03,688
Somehow they seem to put me
at a disadvantage.

621
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:07,066
-Because you're not honest with them?
-Exactly.

622
00:48:07,316 --> 00:48:10,486
Like that business about
the seven parking tickets?

623
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:13,823
What I mean is,
the moment I meet an attractive woman...

624
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:18,744
...l have to start pretending I've no desire
to make love to her.

625
00:48:19,078 --> 00:48:21,247
What makes you think
you have to conceal it?

626
00:48:21,914 --> 00:48:23,874
She might find the idea objectionable.

627
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:26,460
Then again, she might not.

628
00:48:29,797 --> 00:48:32,216
Think how lucky I am
to have been seated here.

629
00:48:32,299 --> 00:48:34,385
Luck had nothing to do with it.

630
00:48:34,969 --> 00:48:35,636
Fate?

631
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:41,517
I tipped the steward $5 to seat you here
if you should come in.

632
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:47,315
Is that a proposition?

633
00:48:49,025 --> 00:48:51,277
I never discuss love on an empty stomach.

634
00:48:52,236 --> 00:48:53,487
You've already eaten.

635
00:48:54,238 --> 00:48:55,323
But you haven't.

636
00:49:02,997 --> 00:49:05,207
Don't you think it's time
we were introduced?

637
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:08,878
I'm Eve Kendall. I'm 26 and unmarried.

638
00:49:10,087 --> 00:49:11,797
Now you know everything.

639
00:49:12,548 --> 00:49:16,218
What do you do besides lure men
to their doom on the 20th Century Limited?

640
00:49:16,469 --> 00:49:18,262
I'm an industrial designer.

641
00:49:20,181 --> 00:49:21,307
Jack Phillips.

642
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:24,268
Western sales manager
for Kingby Electronics.

643
00:49:24,435 --> 00:49:26,812
No, you're not. You're Roger Thornhill...

644
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,606
...of Madison Avenue...

645
00:49:28,648 --> 00:49:31,734
...and you're wanted for murder
on every front page in America.

646
00:49:32,151 --> 00:49:33,861
Don't be so modest.

647
00:49:36,947 --> 00:49:37,865
Don't worry.

648
00:49:38,407 --> 00:49:40,493
-I won't say a word.
-How come?

649
00:49:41,828 --> 00:49:43,204
I told you.

650
00:49:43,788 --> 00:49:44,830
It's a nice face.

651
00:49:45,373 --> 00:49:46,791
Is that the only reason?

652
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:48,918
It's going to be a long night.

653
00:49:50,544 --> 00:49:51,462
True.

654
00:49:51,754 --> 00:49:54,215
I don't particularly like the book
I've started.

655
00:49:56,133 --> 00:49:57,343
You know what I mean?

656
00:49:58,844 --> 00:50:00,262
Let me think.

657
00:50:04,308 --> 00:50:05,935
I know exactly what you mean.

658
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,281
R.O.T.

659
00:50:18,781 --> 00:50:20,449
That's my trademark. R.O.T.

660
00:50:21,325 --> 00:50:23,703
Roger O. Thornhill.
What does the "O" stand for?

661
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:25,955
Nothing.

662
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:52,148
I'd invite you to my bedroom
if I had a bedroom.

663
00:50:52,733 --> 00:50:53,607
A roomette?

664
00:50:53,691 --> 00:50:55,192
Nothing, not even a ticket.

665
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:59,071
I've been playing hide-and-seek
ever since the train left New York.

666
00:51:00,114 --> 00:51:01,365
How awkward for you.

667
00:51:01,532 --> 00:51:02,533
Yes, isn't it?

668
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,826
No place to sleep.

669
00:51:05,369 --> 00:51:07,538
I have a large drawing-room all to myself.

670
00:51:08,373 --> 00:51:09,999
That doesn't seem quite fair.

671
00:51:11,208 --> 00:51:12,544
Drawing-room E.

672
00:51:13,377 --> 00:51:15,130
Car 3901 .

673
00:51:16,088 --> 00:51:17,465
Such a nice number.

674
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:20,886
It's easy to remember.

675
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:22,470
3901 .

676
00:51:23,804 --> 00:51:24,638
See?

677
00:51:26,223 --> 00:51:27,183
No luggage.

678
00:51:30,853 --> 00:51:31,687
So?

679
00:51:31,896 --> 00:51:35,024
You wouldn't happen to have
an extra pair of pajamas, would you?

680
00:51:35,274 --> 00:51:36,400
Wouldn't l?

681
00:51:38,486 --> 00:51:40,738
I wouldn't order any dessert if I were you.

682
00:51:41,781 --> 00:51:42,948
I get the message.

683
00:51:43,866 --> 00:51:45,534
That isn't exactly what I meant.

684
00:51:46,243 --> 00:51:48,746
The train seems to be making
an unscheduled stop.

685
00:51:48,829 --> 00:51:52,375
I saw two men get out of a police car
as we pulled into the station.

686
00:51:53,084 --> 00:51:54,335
They weren't smiling.

687
00:52:16,691 --> 00:52:19,443
You better go out
and tell those police to hurry.

688
00:52:19,527 --> 00:52:21,112
Patience is a virtue.

689
00:52:21,237 --> 00:52:22,738
So is breathing.

690
00:52:22,863 --> 00:52:24,365
Just lie still.

691
00:52:26,034 --> 00:52:27,827
Have you got any olive oil?

692
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:29,120
Olive oil?

693
00:52:29,328 --> 00:52:32,331
I want to be packed in olive oil
if I'm going to be a sardine.

694
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:34,876
Come in.

695
00:52:36,711 --> 00:52:38,921
-Who are you?
-State Police.

696
00:52:40,132 --> 00:52:41,632
Your name please?

697
00:52:41,675 --> 00:52:44,093
Eve Kendall. Is anything wrong?

698
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:46,846
There was a man at your table tonight
in the dining car.

699
00:52:47,638 --> 00:52:48,597
Yes.

700
00:52:48,764 --> 00:52:50,266
Friend of yours?

701
00:52:50,808 --> 00:52:52,184
I never saw him before.

702
00:52:53,561 --> 00:52:54,937
Is this the man?

703
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:59,401
Yes, I think so.
It's not a very clear picture.

704
00:52:59,817 --> 00:53:02,862
It's a wire-photo.
We just got it from the New York police.

705
00:53:02,945 --> 00:53:03,821
Police?

706
00:53:03,904 --> 00:53:05,239
He's wanted for murder.

707
00:53:06,532 --> 00:53:08,159
Good heavens, no!

708
00:53:08,659 --> 00:53:11,120
The steward said
you left the dining car together.

709
00:53:11,746 --> 00:53:15,333
We might have happened to leave
at the same time but not together.

710
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:17,669
What did you two talk about?

711
00:53:18,712 --> 00:53:19,670
Talk about?

712
00:53:19,713 --> 00:53:22,798
The waiter said you were getting along fine
with this Thornhill.

713
00:53:22,923 --> 00:53:24,550
Is that his name? Thornhill?

714
00:53:25,926 --> 00:53:27,261
He didn't tell you?

715
00:53:28,346 --> 00:53:30,473
He didn't tell me anything.

716
00:53:30,682 --> 00:53:33,976
All we did was chat about
different kinds of food...

717
00:53:34,018 --> 00:53:37,146
...train travel versus plane travel,
that sort of thing.

718
00:53:37,688 --> 00:53:41,652
Rather innocuous, I must say,
considering he was a fugitive from justice.

719
00:53:42,193 --> 00:53:43,277
Who did he kill?

720
00:53:43,402 --> 00:53:45,196
He didn't say where he was going?

721
00:53:46,197 --> 00:53:47,198
No.

722
00:53:47,323 --> 00:53:48,951
I assumed Chicago.

723
00:53:49,367 --> 00:53:51,410
Perhaps he got off when you got on?

724
00:53:52,703 --> 00:53:54,872
If you happen to see him again, Miss...

725
00:53:55,289 --> 00:53:56,290
Kendall.

726
00:53:56,457 --> 00:53:58,167
...will you let us know?

727
00:53:58,793 --> 00:54:03,339
I'm going to bed and I'll lock my door.
I doubt if I'll see anybody else tonight.

728
00:54:03,548 --> 00:54:07,051
In case you do, we'll be in
the observation car at the rear of the train.

729
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:09,553
It's comforting to know that.

730
00:54:11,097 --> 00:54:12,181
Good night.

731
00:54:14,225 --> 00:54:15,643
Still breathing?

732
00:54:15,726 --> 00:54:18,020
Either hurry up or get me a snorkel.

733
00:54:19,063 --> 00:54:22,525
I'm looking for the can opener
I stole from the porter.

734
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:29,198
Hello, there.

735
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:30,533
Hello.

736
00:54:43,045 --> 00:54:45,257
Tell me, why are you so good to me?

737
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:48,592
Shall I climb up and tell you why?

738
00:55:02,773 --> 00:55:04,233
I've been thinking...

739
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:08,904
...it's not safe for you to roam Chicago
looking for this George Kaplan...

740
00:55:08,988 --> 00:55:11,032
...you've been telling me about.

741
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:15,077
You'll be picked up by the police
the moment you show your face.

742
00:55:15,536 --> 00:55:17,204
It's such a nice face, too.

743
00:55:19,999 --> 00:55:24,880
Don't you think it'd be a better idea
if you stayed in my hotel room...

744
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:28,966
...while I located him for you
and brought him to you?

745
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,470
I can't let you get involved.
It's too dangerous.

746
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:34,972
I'm a big girl.

747
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:38,851
Yeah, and in all the right places, too.

748
00:55:43,981 --> 00:55:46,859
You know, this is ridiculous.
You know that, don't you?

749
00:55:46,942 --> 00:55:47,860
Yes.

750
00:55:48,194 --> 00:55:50,237
I mean, we've hardly met.

751
00:55:50,446 --> 00:55:51,656
That's right.

752
00:55:52,406 --> 00:55:54,617
How do I know you aren't a murderer?

753
00:55:55,159 --> 00:55:56,410
You don't.

754
00:55:56,994 --> 00:56:00,498
Maybe you're planning to murder me,
right here, tonight.

755
00:56:01,415 --> 00:56:02,541
Shall l?

756
00:56:03,834 --> 00:56:05,086
Please do.

757
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,650
Beats flying, doesn't it?

758
00:56:30,111 --> 00:56:31,613
We should stop.

759
00:56:31,946 --> 00:56:33,280
Immediately.

760
00:56:33,864 --> 00:56:35,866
I ought to know more about you.

761
00:56:36,617 --> 00:56:38,202
What more could you know?

762
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,332
You're an advertising man,
that's all I know.

763
00:56:43,916 --> 00:56:45,168
That's right.

764
00:56:47,754 --> 00:56:50,006
The train's a little unsteady.

765
00:56:50,047 --> 00:56:51,298
Who isn't?

766
00:56:52,216 --> 00:56:54,051
What else do you know?

767
00:56:55,428 --> 00:56:58,682
You've got taste in clothes, taste in food....

768
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:04,438
And taste in women. I like your flavor.

769
00:57:12,945 --> 00:57:15,072
You're very clever with words.

770
00:57:15,407 --> 00:57:18,075
You can probably make them
do anything for you.

771
00:57:19,243 --> 00:57:21,495
Sell people things they don't need...

772
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:24,707
...make women who don't know you
fall in love with you.

773
00:57:27,209 --> 00:57:29,879
I'm beginning to think I'm underpaid.

774
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,769
Look out.

775
00:57:56,405 --> 00:57:59,201
-Don't bother with the washroom.
-Yes, ma'am.

776
00:57:59,283 --> 00:58:02,203
By the way, I found this on the floor.
Does it belong to you?

777
00:58:02,287 --> 00:58:04,414
Yes, ma'am. I've been looking for it.

778
00:58:04,455 --> 00:58:06,624
-I'll wait outside.
-Thank you.

779
00:58:23,684 --> 00:58:24,767
Thank you, Porter.

780
00:58:25,142 --> 00:58:26,978
Thank you, ma'am. Good night now.

781
00:58:27,061 --> 00:58:28,312
Good night.

782
00:58:32,692 --> 00:58:34,986
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

783
00:58:40,032 --> 00:58:41,158
The porter.

784
00:58:43,411 --> 00:58:44,662
So I see.

785
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:54,547
Where were we?

786
00:58:54,672 --> 00:58:55,798
Here.

787
00:59:01,262 --> 00:59:03,264
Nice of him to have opened the bed.

788
00:59:05,392 --> 00:59:06,684
Only one bed.

789
00:59:09,062 --> 00:59:11,397
That's a good omen, don't you think?

790
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,691
Wonderful.

791
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:15,985
Do you know what that means?

792
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:18,112
What? Tell me.

793
00:59:19,196 --> 00:59:21,949
It means you'll sleep on the floor.

794
00:59:43,721 --> 00:59:45,723
A message from the lady in 3901 .

795
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:55,024
What do I do with him
in the morning? Eve.

796
01:00:29,809 --> 01:00:32,311
-You keep walking. I'll catch up.
-Yes, ma'am.

797
01:00:33,938 --> 01:00:35,272
Anything to report?

798
01:00:36,273 --> 01:00:38,150
Yes. I had a fine night's sleep.

799
01:00:38,943 --> 01:00:41,362
I mean, have you seen the man
we're looking for?

800
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:43,239
Mr. Thornycroft?

801
01:00:44,198 --> 01:00:45,116
Thornhill.

802
01:00:46,826 --> 01:00:48,786
No, no. I'm awfully sorry.

803
01:00:49,328 --> 01:00:51,122
But good luck to you both.

804
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:58,963
-How are we doing?
-I may collapse at any moment.

805
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:02,258
Not yet. First we have to run the gauntlet.
Look.

806
01:01:08,139 --> 01:01:12,060
I'm accustomed to having a load on,
but what have you got in these bags?

807
01:01:12,143 --> 01:01:14,688
-Bowling balls, naturally.
-Oh, naturally.

808
01:01:15,021 --> 01:01:17,064
Which one of these has my suit in it?

809
01:01:17,148 --> 01:01:19,525
The small one underneath your right arm.

810
01:01:19,608 --> 01:01:22,028
Thanks. That ought to do the suit
a lot of good.

811
01:01:22,153 --> 01:01:24,488
I'm sure Mr. Kaplan won't mind
a few wrinkles.

812
01:01:24,697 --> 01:01:27,283
Yeah, if he's still there. What time is it?

813
01:01:27,701 --> 01:01:28,785
9:10.

814
01:01:28,868 --> 01:01:31,872
9:10! He may have left
his hotel room by now.

815
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:34,790
I'll call him for you as soon
as we get inside the station.

816
01:01:34,832 --> 01:01:36,292
Thank you. I can do it.

817
01:01:36,334 --> 01:01:39,337
A redcap in a phone booth?
Slightly suspicious.

818
01:01:40,756 --> 01:01:43,507
All right. Do you know
what you'll tell him?

819
01:01:43,841 --> 01:01:47,470
You want to see him right away.
Terribly urgent. Matter of life and death.

820
01:01:47,554 --> 01:01:49,305
-No explanations.
-Right.

821
01:01:49,847 --> 01:01:52,308
While I'm calling,
you can change your clothes.

822
01:01:52,391 --> 01:01:55,854
Where do you propose I do that?
In Marshall Field's window?

823
01:01:55,936 --> 01:01:58,230
I sort of had the men's room in mind.

824
01:01:58,522 --> 01:01:59,815
Did you, now?

825
01:02:00,816 --> 01:02:04,320
You're the smartest girl
I ever spent the night with on a train.

826
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:17,458
I think we made it.

827
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:22,505
Where did he go?

828
01:02:22,588 --> 01:02:24,799
-Which way did he go?
-Where did he go?

829
01:02:24,882 --> 01:02:27,927
I don't know. He took my clothes.
He went up that way.

830
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:44,939
What took you so long?

831
01:04:45,022 --> 01:04:48,359
I have a big face. Small razor.
Tell me, did you get Kaplan?

832
01:04:48,443 --> 01:04:49,360
Yes.

833
01:04:49,568 --> 01:04:50,987
Fine. What did he say?

834
01:04:51,029 --> 01:04:54,115
He'll see you but not at the hotel
under any circumstances.

835
01:04:54,199 --> 01:04:56,534
-He'll see you on the outside.
-Where? When?

836
01:04:56,617 --> 01:04:59,120
-I've got it all written down for you.
-Thanks.

837
01:04:59,203 --> 01:05:01,664
Take the Greyhound Bus
that leaves Chicago...

838
01:05:01,706 --> 01:05:06,712
...for Indianapolis at 2:00 and ask the driver
to let you off at Prairie Stop, Highway 41 .

839
01:05:07,795 --> 01:05:09,798
Prairie Stop, Highway 41 . Good.

840
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,341
It's about an hour-and-a-half's drive
from Chicago.

841
01:05:12,383 --> 01:05:13,718
Fine. I'll rent a car.

842
01:05:13,801 --> 01:05:17,888
No car. Mr. Kaplan said bus.
He wants to be sure you're alone.

843
01:05:18,389 --> 01:05:21,017
All right. What'll I do when I get there?

844
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:23,561
Just wait beside the road.
He'll be there at 3:30.

845
01:05:23,644 --> 01:05:25,688
-How will I know him?
-He'll know you.

846
01:05:25,771 --> 01:05:27,857
You made the Chicago papers, too.

847
01:05:29,734 --> 01:05:31,861
Have you set your watch for Central time?

848
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:33,863
Yes, I did that. Thanks.

849
01:05:34,739 --> 01:05:36,240
What's the matter?

850
01:05:36,282 --> 01:05:37,074
Matter?

851
01:05:37,575 --> 01:05:39,994
Yes, you seem.... I don't know.
You seem tense.

852
01:05:40,078 --> 01:05:42,580
You better go before the police
run out of red caps.

853
01:05:43,122 --> 01:05:45,082
We'll see each other again, won't we?

854
01:05:45,916 --> 01:05:47,626
Sometime, I'm sure.

855
01:05:48,753 --> 01:05:51,255
I never had a moment
to thank you properly.

856
01:05:51,297 --> 01:05:53,634
-Please go.
-But where will I find you?

857
01:05:54,635 --> 01:05:56,344
I've got to pick up my bags now.

858
01:05:56,927 --> 01:05:59,848
Yes. These are the checks
for the large cases.

859
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:01,182
Wait a minute.

860
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:02,933
Please.

861
01:06:04,769 --> 01:06:05,770
They're coming.

862
01:10:33,454 --> 01:10:35,331
-Hot day.
-I've seen worse.

863
01:10:38,584 --> 01:10:40,879
Are you supposed
to be meeting someone here?

864
01:10:40,961 --> 01:10:43,673
I'm waiting for the bus.
It's due any minute.

865
01:10:45,216 --> 01:10:48,594
Some of them crop-duster pilots get rich
if they live long enough.

866
01:10:53,057 --> 01:10:55,017
Then your name isn't Kaplan?

867
01:10:55,726 --> 01:10:57,770
Can't say it is, 'cause it ain't.

868
01:10:58,729 --> 01:11:00,815
Here she comes. Right on time.

869
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:06,195
-That's funny.
-What?

870
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:09,491
That plane's dusting crops
where there ain't no crops.

871
01:15:03,182 --> 01:15:05,685
Get out of here! The other tank may blow!

872
01:15:16,988 --> 01:15:18,322
What happened?

873
01:15:44,725 --> 01:15:45,809
Come back!

874
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,477
Come back! Come back!

875
01:16:40,571 --> 01:16:43,866
Could you let me have
Mr. George Kaplan's room number, please?

876
01:16:43,949 --> 01:16:45,118
Kaplan?

877
01:16:45,409 --> 01:16:47,204
I think he checked out.

878
01:16:48,413 --> 01:16:49,456
Checked out?

879
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:52,376
That's right.
He checked out at 7:10 this morning.

880
01:16:52,459 --> 01:16:53,959
7:10? Are you sure?

881
01:16:54,168 --> 01:16:56,212
Yes. He left a forwarding address.

882
01:16:56,253 --> 01:16:59,298
Hotel Sheraton-Johnson,
Rapid City, South Dakota.

883
01:16:59,507 --> 01:17:00,591
7:10?

884
01:17:01,509 --> 01:17:04,096
Then how come I got a message
from him at 9:00....

885
01:17:04,178 --> 01:17:05,304
What's that?

886
01:17:08,849 --> 01:17:10,060
Nothing.

887
01:17:38,129 --> 01:17:40,172
Sorry to bother you again.

888
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:43,427
Miss Eve Kendall is expecting me.
She's in room four-something.

889
01:17:43,468 --> 01:17:45,970
I've forgotten the number.
Would you mind?

890
01:17:55,438 --> 01:17:57,940
-She's in 463.
-Yes, that's right. Thanks.

891
01:18:24,508 --> 01:18:25,551
Hello.

892
01:18:32,058 --> 01:18:33,059
Surprised?

893
01:18:34,185 --> 01:18:35,144
Yes.

894
01:18:36,354 --> 01:18:38,189
No getting rid of me, is there?

895
01:18:50,117 --> 01:18:51,869
I could use a drink.

896
01:18:53,663 --> 01:18:55,039
I have some scotch.

897
01:18:55,081 --> 01:18:56,832
With water. No ice.

898
01:19:01,713 --> 01:19:05,341
Two Die As Crop-Duster Plane Crashes
Craft Hits Oil Tanker, Drivers Escape

899
01:19:05,716 --> 01:19:07,510
How did it go today?

900
01:19:10,805 --> 01:19:12,765
The meeting with Kaplan?

901
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:16,520
He didn't show up.

902
01:19:19,063 --> 01:19:20,607
It's funny, isn't it?

903
01:19:21,566 --> 01:19:22,400
Why funny?

904
01:19:23,067 --> 01:19:27,363
After all those explicit directions
he gave you on the phone.

905
01:19:28,949 --> 01:19:30,700
Maybe I copied them down wrong.

906
01:19:31,283 --> 01:19:35,247
I don't think you got them wrong.
I think you sent me to the right place.

907
01:19:38,292 --> 01:19:41,336
Why don't you call him back again
and see what happened?

908
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:44,464
I did. He checked out.
Went to South Dakota.

909
01:19:45,632 --> 01:19:46,882
South Dakota?

910
01:19:47,466 --> 01:19:48,760
Rapid City.

911
01:19:50,762 --> 01:19:52,430
What are you going to do next?

912
01:19:53,431 --> 01:19:55,017
I haven't made my mind up yet.

913
01:19:55,433 --> 01:19:57,226
It may depend on you.

914
01:19:58,853 --> 01:19:59,895
On me?

915
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:01,315
Sure.

916
01:20:02,481 --> 01:20:04,692
You're my little helper, aren't you?

917
01:20:04,984 --> 01:20:06,068
Thank you.

918
01:20:06,152 --> 01:20:09,573
To us. To a long and lasting friendship.

919
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:14,661
Meaning, from now on, I'm not going
to let you out of my sight, sweetheart.

920
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:17,914
-I'm afraid you'll have to.
-Oh, no.

921
01:20:18,205 --> 01:20:22,251
I do have plans of my own, you know.
And you do have problems.

922
01:20:23,003 --> 01:20:27,673
Wouldn't it be nice if my problems
and your plans were somehow connected?

923
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:30,552
Then we could always stay close
to each other...

924
01:20:30,634 --> 01:20:35,014
...and not have to go in separate directions.
Togetherness. You know what I mean?

925
01:20:39,143 --> 01:20:41,020
Go ahead, it can't be for me.

926
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:54,534
No, not yet. I'm not ready.

927
01:20:55,535 --> 01:20:56,661
What time?

928
01:20:57,328 --> 01:20:59,623
I'll meet you. What's the address?

929
01:21:03,084 --> 01:21:04,502
Yes. Goodbye.

930
01:21:07,839 --> 01:21:09,007
Business?

931
01:21:09,507 --> 01:21:10,216
Yes.

932
01:21:10,299 --> 01:21:12,593
Industrial designing business?

933
01:21:16,181 --> 01:21:17,974
All work and no play.

934
01:21:18,599 --> 01:21:23,354
You should be enjoying yourself tonight
instead of taking phone calls from clients.

935
01:21:25,356 --> 01:21:27,651
What about having dinner with me?

936
01:21:27,818 --> 01:21:30,069
You can't afford to be seen anyplace.

937
01:21:30,152 --> 01:21:32,613
Let's have it up here. Nice and cozy.

938
01:21:32,697 --> 01:21:33,823
No, l....

939
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:36,159
I can't.

940
01:21:37,827 --> 01:21:38,995
I insist.

941
01:21:41,038 --> 01:21:43,458
I want you to do a favor for me.

942
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,085
-A big, big favor.
-Name it.

943
01:21:47,378 --> 01:21:49,171
I want you to leave right now.

944
01:21:49,964 --> 01:21:52,508
Stay far away from me
and don't come near me again.

945
01:21:56,054 --> 01:21:57,722
We're not going to get involved.

946
01:21:58,389 --> 01:22:00,976
Last night was last night
and that's all there was.

947
01:22:01,684 --> 01:22:04,895
That's all there is. There won't be
anything more between us.

948
01:22:05,563 --> 01:22:06,814
So, please....

949
01:22:07,524 --> 01:22:08,483
Goodbye.

950
01:22:09,025 --> 01:22:11,612
Good luck. No conversation. Just leave.

951
01:22:12,194 --> 01:22:13,154
Right away?

952
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:14,615
Yes.

953
01:22:15,323 --> 01:22:16,700
No questions asked?

954
01:22:17,283 --> 01:22:18,117
Yes.

955
01:22:19,870 --> 01:22:21,038
I can't do that.

956
01:22:21,245 --> 01:22:22,246
Please.

957
01:22:22,788 --> 01:22:23,748
After dinner.

958
01:22:23,915 --> 01:22:24,874
Now.

959
01:22:25,167 --> 01:22:26,667
After dinner. Fair is fair.

960
01:22:29,379 --> 01:22:30,504
All right.

961
01:22:31,256 --> 01:22:32,631
On one condition.

962
01:22:33,841 --> 01:22:37,596
That you let the hotel valet
do something with this suit first.

963
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:40,097
You belong in the stockyards
looking like that.

964
01:22:40,181 --> 01:22:41,140
Okay.

965
01:22:42,935 --> 01:22:44,393
There's the phone.

966
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:51,651
Valet service, please.

967
01:22:59,409 --> 01:23:01,495
-Where are we?
-463.

968
01:23:02,119 --> 01:23:03,454
Room 463.

969
01:23:04,121 --> 01:23:06,708
How quickly can you get a suit
sponged and pressed?

970
01:23:06,792 --> 01:23:07,876
Yes, fast.

971
01:23:08,626 --> 01:23:10,586
20 minutes? Fine.

972
01:23:10,963 --> 01:23:12,338
Okay. 463.

973
01:23:15,758 --> 01:23:17,219
He'll be right up.

974
01:23:17,344 --> 01:23:19,553
Better take your things off.

975
01:23:22,516 --> 01:23:25,893
Now, what could a man do
with his clothes off for 20 minutes?

976
01:23:25,977 --> 01:23:27,604
Couldn't he have taken an hour?

977
01:23:27,688 --> 01:23:29,898
You could always take a cold shower.

978
01:23:29,981 --> 01:23:31,190
That's right.

979
01:23:32,441 --> 01:23:35,988
When I was a little boy,
I wouldn't even let my mother undress me.

980
01:23:36,071 --> 01:23:37,405
You're a big boy now.

981
01:23:42,034 --> 01:23:45,871
Tell me, how does a girl like you
get to be a girl like you?

982
01:23:47,332 --> 01:23:48,500
Lucky, I guess.

983
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,961
Not lucky. Naughty. Wicked.
Up to no good.

984
01:23:52,378 --> 01:23:53,462
Ever kill anyone?

985
01:23:55,089 --> 01:23:58,509
Because I bet you could tease a man
to death without half trying.

986
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:00,053
So, stop trying.

987
01:24:10,813 --> 01:24:12,482
Be with you in a minute.

988
01:24:17,821 --> 01:24:19,030
Trousers, please.

989
01:24:26,746 --> 01:24:27,998
Thank you.

990
01:24:29,373 --> 01:24:31,876
Think I'll take that cold shower after all.

991
01:24:32,001 --> 01:24:33,127
Good.

992
01:25:24,596 --> 01:25:25,389
1212 N. MICHIGAN

993
01:25:44,157 --> 01:25:46,826
This magnificent pair
of Louis Seize Fauteuils.

994
01:25:46,909 --> 01:25:50,497
Original gilt finish.
Upholstered in pure silk damask.

995
01:25:50,622 --> 01:25:53,750
How much may I say to start?
What am I bid?

996
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:56,419
-$100.
-$100 is bid. Thank you.

997
01:25:56,837 --> 01:25:58,964
$150 is bid here. Say to $200?

998
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:00,799
Thank you. $200 is bid.

999
01:26:00,841 --> 01:26:03,217
Say to $300? I have $300.

1000
01:26:03,927 --> 01:26:05,845
$400 by the little lady.

1001
01:26:06,054 --> 01:26:07,139
Thank you, sir.

1002
01:26:07,222 --> 01:26:09,765
$450 is bid for the pair. Can I hear $500?

1003
01:26:09,849 --> 01:26:11,268
Will you say $500?

1004
01:26:11,476 --> 01:26:13,144
Can I say the $500?

1005
01:26:13,686 --> 01:26:15,522
Fair warning and last call.

1006
01:26:15,689 --> 01:26:19,150
Sold to Mr. Stone, second row. $450.

1007
01:26:24,405 --> 01:26:25,949
Lot number 103.

1008
01:26:27,450 --> 01:26:29,285
This lovely Aubusson settee.

1009
01:26:29,827 --> 01:26:32,997
In excellent condition.
Please start the bidding.

1010
01:26:33,831 --> 01:26:34,832
How much?

1011
01:26:35,666 --> 01:26:39,253
$800 is offered, thank you.
$800 is bid. Say the nine? Go $900.

1012
01:26:39,588 --> 01:26:40,505
$900 is bid.

1013
01:26:40,589 --> 01:26:42,298
Now who'll say $1,000?

1014
01:26:42,758 --> 01:26:43,842
$1,000, thank you.

1015
01:26:43,924 --> 01:26:45,927
$1,000 at $1,000. Say $1,100.

1016
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:48,679
Can I hear $1,100? Selling at $1,000.

1017
01:26:48,847 --> 01:26:50,639
The three of you together.

1018
01:26:50,933 --> 01:26:53,851
Now, that's a picture
only Charles Addams could draw.

1019
01:26:53,934 --> 01:26:55,478
Good evening, Mr. Kaplan.

1020
01:26:55,561 --> 01:26:58,898
Before we start calling each other names,
you'd better tell me yours.

1021
01:26:58,981 --> 01:27:01,651
-I haven't had the pleasure.
-You disappoint me, sir.

1022
01:27:02,569 --> 01:27:04,529
I was just going to say that to her.

1023
01:27:04,571 --> 01:27:07,574
I've always understood you were
a shrewd fellow at your job.

1024
01:27:07,658 --> 01:27:10,534
What possessed you to come
blundering in here like this?

1025
01:27:10,576 --> 01:27:12,746
Could it be an overpowering
interest in art?

1026
01:27:13,245 --> 01:27:14,998
Yes. The art of survival.

1027
01:27:17,125 --> 01:27:18,168
Have you poured any good drunks lately?

1028
01:27:20,544 --> 01:27:22,381
He followed me here from the hotel.

1029
01:27:23,423 --> 01:27:24,924
He was in your room?

1030
01:27:25,342 --> 01:27:26,676
Sure, isn't everybody?

1031
01:27:27,386 --> 01:27:29,721
$150. Thank you. Now, say the two.

1032
01:27:29,887 --> 01:27:30,971
Do I hear two?

1033
01:27:31,055 --> 01:27:32,264
$200, thank you.

1034
01:27:32,348 --> 01:27:35,184
Now the three. Do I hear three?
$300, anyone?

1035
01:27:35,226 --> 01:27:36,352
$300. Thank you.

1036
01:27:36,394 --> 01:27:38,814
Now, the four. Do I hear four?
$400, anyone?

1037
01:27:39,563 --> 01:27:40,564
$400 is bid.

1038
01:27:40,648 --> 01:27:42,733
Say the five. I have $400.

1039
01:27:43,609 --> 01:27:47,447
I didn't realize you were an art collector.
I thought you just collected corpses.

1040
01:27:48,781 --> 01:27:49,740
$500.

1041
01:27:50,241 --> 01:27:51,535
$500. Thank you.

1042
01:27:51,576 --> 01:27:54,870
I'll bet you paid plenty
for this little piece of sculpture.

1043
01:27:56,414 --> 01:27:57,373
$700.

1044
01:27:57,498 --> 01:27:59,918
She's worth every dollar of it,
take it from me.

1045
01:28:01,043 --> 01:28:03,212
She puts her heart into her work.

1046
01:28:03,295 --> 01:28:05,090
In fact her whole body.

1047
01:28:05,881 --> 01:28:07,842
Sold to Mr. Vandamm at $700.

1048
01:28:10,469 --> 01:28:12,513
Oh, Mr. Vandamm.

1049
01:28:13,806 --> 01:28:18,811
Has anyone told you that you overplay
your various roles rather severely?

1050
01:28:19,228 --> 01:28:21,732
First, you're the outraged
Madison Avenue man...

1051
01:28:21,773 --> 01:28:24,275
...who claims he's been mistaken
for someone else.

1052
01:28:24,317 --> 01:28:25,944
Then, you play the fugitive...

1053
01:28:26,028 --> 01:28:28,738
...trying to clear his name of a crime
he didn't commit.

1054
01:28:29,655 --> 01:28:32,075
Now you play the peevish lover...

1055
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:34,077
...stung by jealousy and betrayal.

1056
01:28:35,203 --> 01:28:38,205
It seems you fellows could stand
less training from the FBI...

1057
01:28:38,290 --> 01:28:40,207
...and more from the Actors' Studio.

1058
01:28:41,376 --> 01:28:45,087
Apparently, the only performance
that will satisfy you is when I play dead.

1059
01:28:45,547 --> 01:28:48,967
Your very next role.
You'll be quite convincing, I assure you.

1060
01:28:50,217 --> 01:28:52,178
Thank you. $375 is bid.

1061
01:28:52,261 --> 01:28:54,097
I have $375, go to $400.

1062
01:28:54,139 --> 01:28:55,431
$375, go four?

1063
01:28:56,058 --> 01:28:56,974
$400 is bid.

1064
01:28:57,059 --> 01:29:01,020
I wonder what subtle form of manslaughter
is next on the program.

1065
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:04,065
Am I to be dropped
into a vat of molten steel...

1066
01:29:04,148 --> 01:29:06,485
...and become part of a new skyscraper?

1067
01:29:06,984 --> 01:29:11,238
Or are you going to ask this female
to kiss me again and poison me to death?

1068
01:29:14,367 --> 01:29:17,745
Who are you kidding?
You have no feelings to hurt.

1069
01:29:26,170 --> 01:29:28,130
We've had just about enough of you.

1070
01:29:28,214 --> 01:29:30,299
Then, why don't you send for the police?

1071
01:29:32,343 --> 01:29:35,847
That's the last thing you'd want, isn't it?
Me in the hands of the police.

1072
01:29:35,930 --> 01:29:37,808
There's something I might tell them.

1073
01:29:37,849 --> 01:29:40,643
That's why you had her hustle me
on the train last night.

1074
01:29:40,978 --> 01:29:44,772
Something tells me I've got a better
chance of survival if I go to the police.

1075
01:29:46,357 --> 01:29:49,194
Good night, sweetheart.
Don't think it wasn't nice.

1076
01:29:49,986 --> 01:29:53,448
$1,200 there. $1,200 is bid. Say $1,300?

1077
01:29:53,698 --> 01:29:55,492
May I hear $1,300?

1078
01:29:55,950 --> 01:29:58,494
They're selling at $1,200.
Do I hear $1,300, please?

1079
01:29:59,705 --> 01:30:00,789
Last call.

1080
01:30:01,497 --> 01:30:04,375
Sold. $1,200. Thank you.

1081
01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:13,176
Catalogue number 109.

1082
01:30:14,386 --> 01:30:17,763
This superb example
of this early 17th century master.

1083
01:30:18,348 --> 01:30:20,684
It will enhance any collection of fine art.

1084
01:30:21,434 --> 01:30:23,812
What is your pleasure?
How much to start?

1085
01:30:24,771 --> 01:30:26,230
$1,000.

1086
01:30:26,564 --> 01:30:27,899
$1,000 is bid.

1087
01:30:28,566 --> 01:30:30,568
$1,250 I have. Now $1,500.

1088
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,031
$1,500 is bid. Thank you.

1089
01:30:34,114 --> 01:30:35,198
$1,750?

1090
01:30:37,074 --> 01:30:38,452
I have $1,750.

1091
01:30:38,576 --> 01:30:39,535
$2,000.

1092
01:30:39,618 --> 01:30:43,039
$2,000 is bid. I have $2,000.
Do I hear $2,500?

1093
01:30:44,290 --> 01:30:45,626
$2,500, anyone?

1094
01:30:46,585 --> 01:30:47,669
$2,250 once.

1095
01:30:49,295 --> 01:30:50,588
$2,250 twice.

1096
01:30:51,255 --> 01:30:52,381
Last call.

1097
01:30:52,590 --> 01:30:53,591
$1,500.

1098
01:30:55,176 --> 01:30:57,553
But the bid is already up to $2,250, sir.

1099
01:30:57,595 --> 01:30:59,097
I still say $1,500.

1100
01:31:01,724 --> 01:31:03,393
I have $2,250.

1101
01:31:03,934 --> 01:31:05,395
Do I hear $2,500?

1102
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:08,230
$2,250 once, $2,250 twice.

1103
01:31:08,565 --> 01:31:09,566
$1,200.

1104
01:31:09,774 --> 01:31:11,818
Sold for $2,250. And now--

1105
01:31:11,984 --> 01:31:13,944
$2,250, for that chromo?

1106
01:31:18,909 --> 01:31:21,078
Number 1 10 in the catalogue.

1107
01:31:21,702 --> 01:31:24,413
A Louis Quinze carved
and gilded lit de repos.

1108
01:31:24,955 --> 01:31:27,750
Would somebody start the bidding
at $750, please?

1109
01:31:28,084 --> 01:31:31,045
How do we know it's not a fake?
It looks like a fake.

1110
01:31:34,215 --> 01:31:38,260
One thing we know. You're no fake.
You're a genuine idiot.

1111
01:31:38,762 --> 01:31:39,637
Thank you.

1112
01:31:40,471 --> 01:31:41,932
I wonder if I could...

1113
01:31:42,015 --> 01:31:45,267
...ask the gentleman to get into the spirit
of the proceedings.

1114
01:31:45,309 --> 01:31:47,104
All right. I'll start it at $800.

1115
01:31:48,063 --> 01:31:49,438
$800. Thank you.

1116
01:31:50,190 --> 01:31:50,856
$900?

1117
01:31:51,565 --> 01:31:53,527
$1,000 is bid. Go $1,200.

1118
01:31:53,985 --> 01:31:54,777
$1,100.

1119
01:31:55,152 --> 01:31:57,489
$1,100 is bid. Thank you. Go $1,200.

1120
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:59,407
I have $1,100.

1121
01:31:59,491 --> 01:32:01,283
Go $1,200. Who'll say $1,200?

1122
01:32:01,951 --> 01:32:03,954
$1,100 once. Who'll say $1,200?

1123
01:32:04,328 --> 01:32:05,329
$1,100 twice.

1124
01:32:05,413 --> 01:32:06,832
$1,200. Thank you.

1125
01:32:06,915 --> 01:32:09,084
$1,200 is bid. I have $1,200. Go $1,300.

1126
01:32:09,167 --> 01:32:10,459
Who'll say $1,300?

1127
01:32:10,501 --> 01:32:11,502
$13.

1128
01:32:14,339 --> 01:32:15,589
You mean $1,300, sir.

1129
01:32:17,174 --> 01:32:19,553
No, I mean $13.
That's more than it's worth.

1130
01:32:23,724 --> 01:32:25,016
I have $1,200.

1131
01:32:25,224 --> 01:32:27,184
Go $1,300. Who'll say $1,300?

1132
01:32:28,269 --> 01:32:29,855
Who'll say $1,250?

1133
01:32:32,523 --> 01:32:33,774
$1,200 once.

1134
01:32:33,858 --> 01:32:34,900
$1,200 twice.

1135
01:32:35,526 --> 01:32:37,112
Last call. $1,200.

1136
01:32:37,195 --> 01:32:38,196
$2,000.

1137
01:32:41,450 --> 01:32:42,409
$2,000?

1138
01:32:44,702 --> 01:32:45,495
$2,100.

1139
01:32:46,871 --> 01:32:48,456
I'm sorry, but we can't--

1140
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:49,957
Make it $2,500.

1141
01:32:55,629 --> 01:32:57,966
Would the gentleman please cooperate?

1142
01:32:58,050 --> 01:32:59,508
The last bid was $1,200.

1143
01:33:00,093 --> 01:33:02,220
$2,500. My money is as good
as anybody's.

1144
01:33:04,638 --> 01:33:05,681
I have--

1145
01:33:06,350 --> 01:33:08,059
-What was it?
-$1,200.

1146
01:33:08,976 --> 01:33:11,854
I have $1,200 once, $1,200 twice--

1147
01:33:12,229 --> 01:33:13,230
$3,000.

1148
01:33:13,272 --> 01:33:14,357
Sold for $1,200.

1149
01:33:17,986 --> 01:33:21,238
-I won't let you get away with that.
-You'd better leave, sir.

1150
01:33:21,322 --> 01:33:23,449
Take your hands off me or I'll sue you.

1151
01:33:38,339 --> 01:33:40,801
-What took you so long?
-Let's take a little walk.

1152
01:33:40,884 --> 01:33:41,760
Get moving.

1153
01:33:41,843 --> 01:33:44,762
I haven't finished bidding yet.
$3,000. I bid $3,000.

1154
01:33:45,721 --> 01:33:48,225
I'm sorry, old man. Too bad. Keep trying.

1155
01:33:49,809 --> 01:33:51,186
Not so rough!

1156
01:33:59,735 --> 01:34:01,904
-Handle with care, fellas.
-In there.

1157
01:34:01,946 --> 01:34:03,740
-I'm valuable property.
-In.

1158
01:34:08,119 --> 01:34:12,082
I want to thank you for saving my life.
Thank you, my friend. Thank you.

1159
01:34:12,207 --> 01:34:14,126
Save it for the stationhouse.

1160
01:34:18,838 --> 01:34:21,425
Let's have some smiles and good cheer.

1161
01:34:21,632 --> 01:34:24,385
You're about to become heroes.
Don't you know who I am?

1162
01:34:25,762 --> 01:34:29,515
We'll find out as soon as we book you
for being drunk and disorderly.

1163
01:34:29,891 --> 01:34:33,061
That's chicken feed. You've hit the jackpot.

1164
01:34:33,311 --> 01:34:36,689
"Chicago police capture
United Nations killer."

1165
01:34:38,066 --> 01:34:39,859
My name is Roger Thornhill.

1166
01:34:40,401 --> 01:34:41,361
Here.

1167
01:34:45,114 --> 01:34:47,825
-It's him.
-That's right. Congratulations.

1168
01:34:50,161 --> 01:34:52,371
This is 1055. Sergeant Flamm.

1169
01:34:53,122 --> 01:34:56,667
We've got a man here who answers
to the description of Thornhill, Roger.

1170
01:34:57,209 --> 01:34:58,627
Code 76.

1171
01:34:59,004 --> 01:35:01,922
Wanted by NYPD. Positive ID.

1172
01:35:03,549 --> 01:35:05,135
Absolutely. No question.

1173
01:35:06,927 --> 01:35:10,014
Michigan Avenue. Proceeding north
to 42nd precinct.

1174
01:35:13,435 --> 01:35:14,435
What?

1175
01:35:16,479 --> 01:35:17,355
Come again!

1176
01:35:19,942 --> 01:35:21,150
Are you sure?

1177
01:35:22,526 --> 01:35:24,029
Okay. Right.

1178
01:35:24,528 --> 01:35:25,821
Yeah, I got it.

1179
01:35:26,114 --> 01:35:27,782
1055, off and clear.

1180
01:35:30,451 --> 01:35:32,536
-Where are we going?
-The airport.

1181
01:35:33,372 --> 01:35:34,997
-For what?
-Orders.

1182
01:35:35,831 --> 01:35:40,127
Airport? I'm not going to any airport.
I want to be taken to police headquarters.

1183
01:35:40,378 --> 01:35:41,504
You do, huh?

1184
01:35:42,171 --> 01:35:43,966
Why do you think I sent for you?

1185
01:35:44,048 --> 01:35:46,634
How about this guy? He sent for us!

1186
01:35:46,969 --> 01:35:47,886
Sit back!

1187
01:35:47,928 --> 01:35:50,805
Didn't you hear? I want to be taken
to police headquarters.

1188
01:35:50,888 --> 01:35:53,891
I'm a dangerous assassin.
I'm a mad killer on the loose!

1189
01:35:53,975 --> 01:35:56,186
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1190
01:36:07,656 --> 01:36:12,326
NORTHWEST

1191
01:36:22,628 --> 01:36:23,921
They said right here.

1192
01:36:24,005 --> 01:36:27,216
Does anyone mind if I sit down?
I've been running all day.

1193
01:36:38,477 --> 01:36:41,605
Thought I'd never make it.
Getting too old for this kind of work.

1194
01:36:42,190 --> 01:36:43,691
All right, men. Thank you.

1195
01:36:44,276 --> 01:36:47,194
This way, Mr. Thornhill.
We haven't got much time.

1196
01:36:47,611 --> 01:36:49,406
This way is more private.

1197
01:36:53,326 --> 01:36:55,077
I don't think I caught your name.

1198
01:36:55,286 --> 01:36:57,079
I don't think I pitched it.

1199
01:36:57,831 --> 01:37:00,207
You're police, aren't you? Or is it FBI?

1200
01:37:00,624 --> 01:37:04,337
FBI, CIA, ONI.
We're all in the same alphabet soup.

1201
01:37:05,088 --> 01:37:09,259
You can stick this in your alphabet soup.
I had nothing to do with that killing.

1202
01:37:09,301 --> 01:37:11,261
-We know that.
-You know it?

1203
01:37:11,386 --> 01:37:14,221
Then why did you let the police
chase me all over the map?

1204
01:37:14,305 --> 01:37:18,059
We never interfere with the police
unless absolutely necessary.

1205
01:37:18,644 --> 01:37:20,311
It has become necessary.

1206
01:37:21,145 --> 01:37:23,272
Then, I take it I'm to be cleared.

1207
01:37:23,439 --> 01:37:26,442
I wish you'd walk faster, Mr. Thornhill.
We'll miss the plane.

1208
01:37:26,484 --> 01:37:28,778
Where are we going?
New York or Washington?

1209
01:37:28,819 --> 01:37:30,863
Rapid City, South Dakota.

1210
01:37:31,239 --> 01:37:33,115
Rapid City? What for?

1211
01:37:33,325 --> 01:37:34,825
It's near Mt. Rushmore.

1212
01:37:34,909 --> 01:37:36,952
No, thank you. I've seen Mt. Rushmore.

1213
01:37:36,994 --> 01:37:38,996
So has your friend Mr. Vandamm.

1214
01:37:39,997 --> 01:37:41,123
Vandamm?

1215
01:37:41,832 --> 01:37:43,627
A rather formidable gentleman.

1216
01:37:44,711 --> 01:37:47,171
What about that treacherous
little tramp with him?

1217
01:37:47,254 --> 01:37:48,464
Miss Kendall?

1218
01:37:48,673 --> 01:37:50,926
His mistress. We know all about her.

1219
01:37:52,426 --> 01:37:54,553
Tell me, what's Vandamm up to?

1220
01:37:54,637 --> 01:37:57,473
You could say he's a sort
of importer-exporter.

1221
01:37:57,723 --> 01:37:58,766
Of what?

1222
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,061
Government secrets, perhaps.

1223
01:38:02,646 --> 01:38:04,313
Then why don't you grab him?

1224
01:38:04,439 --> 01:38:07,358
There's still too much we don't know
about his organization.

1225
01:38:07,441 --> 01:38:11,112
I see. What's all this got to do
with Mt. Rushmore?

1226
01:38:11,738 --> 01:38:13,739
Vandamm has a place near there.

1227
01:38:13,865 --> 01:38:17,284
We think it's his jumping-off point
to leave the country tomorrow night.

1228
01:38:17,368 --> 01:38:19,787
-Are you going to stop him?
-No.

1229
01:38:19,870 --> 01:38:21,331
Then why are we going there?

1230
01:38:21,872 --> 01:38:24,000
To set his mind at ease
about George Kaplan.

1231
01:38:25,668 --> 01:38:26,836
Oh, you, huh?

1232
01:38:26,877 --> 01:38:28,754
You're George Kaplan, aren't you?

1233
01:38:28,838 --> 01:38:31,591
There is no such person as George Kaplan.

1234
01:38:31,675 --> 01:38:34,010
What do you mean? I've been in his room.

1235
01:38:34,051 --> 01:38:37,055
I've tried on his clothes.
He's got short sleeves and dandruff!

1236
01:38:37,096 --> 01:38:39,141
Believe me, he doesn't exist.

1237
01:38:40,058 --> 01:38:44,687
Which is why I'm going to have to ask you
to go on being him for the next 24 hours.

1238
01:38:46,148 --> 01:38:48,566
Come on! We'll discuss it on the plane.

1239
01:39:10,629 --> 01:39:14,216
You started the decoy business
without me, you finish it without me!

1240
01:39:14,301 --> 01:39:16,553
We might have
if you hadn't stumbled into it.

1241
01:39:16,595 --> 01:39:20,431
You should give me a medal and a vacation
instead of asking me to be a target...

1242
01:39:20,514 --> 01:39:23,309
...just so your special agent
doesn't get shot at!

1243
01:39:23,601 --> 01:39:25,938
Not shot at, Mr. Thornhill. Found out.

1244
01:39:26,228 --> 01:39:28,564
Once found out they're as good as dead.

1245
01:39:28,814 --> 01:39:32,110
Thanks to you,
clouds of suspicion are already forming.

1246
01:39:32,777 --> 01:39:34,070
Thanks to me?

1247
01:39:35,405 --> 01:39:36,906
You listen to me.

1248
01:39:37,114 --> 01:39:39,451
I'm an advertising man, not a red herring!

1249
01:39:39,534 --> 01:39:41,703
I've got a job, a secretary, a mother...

1250
01:39:41,786 --> 01:39:44,706
...two ex-wives and several bartenders
dependent upon me...

1251
01:39:44,790 --> 01:39:47,918
...and I don't intend to disappoint them
by getting myself killed!

1252
01:39:48,459 --> 01:39:49,836
The answer is no.

1253
01:39:50,753 --> 01:39:52,254
-Is that final?
-Yes.

1254
01:39:53,173 --> 01:39:54,840
-Goodbye, then.
-Goodbye.

1255
01:39:55,341 --> 01:39:58,886
If there was a chance of changing
your mind I'd talk about Miss Kendall...

1256
01:39:59,804 --> 01:40:01,806
...of whom you so obviously disapprove.

1257
01:40:01,889 --> 01:40:05,477
Yes, for using sex
like some people use a fly-swatter.

1258
01:40:05,977 --> 01:40:07,895
I suppose it doesn't matter to you...

1259
01:40:07,979 --> 01:40:12,024
...that she was probably forced to do
whatever she did to protect herself.

1260
01:40:12,316 --> 01:40:14,527
To protect herself from what?

1261
01:40:14,610 --> 01:40:16,779
Exposure, assassination.

1262
01:40:18,447 --> 01:40:20,658
You see, Mr. Thornhill, she's....

1263
01:40:21,326 --> 01:40:23,245
She's one of our agents.

1264
01:40:24,288 --> 01:40:25,247
Oh, no!

1265
01:40:25,330 --> 01:40:26,956
I know you didn't mean it...

1266
01:40:27,039 --> 01:40:31,002
...but I'm afraid you have put her
in an extremely dangerous situation.

1267
01:40:32,837 --> 01:40:35,256
And much more than her life is at stake.

1268
01:40:49,854 --> 01:40:51,273
Suppose they don't come?

1269
01:40:51,731 --> 01:40:53,149
They'll come.

1270
01:40:54,775 --> 01:40:57,987
I don't like the way Teddy Roosevelt
is looking at me.

1271
01:40:58,279 --> 01:41:02,199
Perhaps he's trying to give you
one last word of caution, Mr. Kaplan.

1272
01:41:02,241 --> 01:41:04,285
"Speak softly, and carry a big stick."

1273
01:41:04,744 --> 01:41:08,372
He's trying to tell me not to go through
with this harebrained scheme.

1274
01:41:08,456 --> 01:41:11,959
He doesn't know to what extent
you are the cause of our present trouble.

1275
01:41:12,043 --> 01:41:14,628
I don't know that I care
to accept that charge.

1276
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:19,759
If you hadn't made yourself so attractive
to Miss Kendall that she fell for you...

1277
01:41:19,842 --> 01:41:21,010
And vice versa.

1278
01:41:21,052 --> 01:41:24,347
...our friend Vandamm wouldn't be
losing faith in her loyalty now.

1279
01:41:24,806 --> 01:41:28,768
It was quite obvious to him last night
that she had become emotionally involved.

1280
01:41:28,852 --> 01:41:32,521
Worst of all, with a man he thinks
is a government agent.

1281
01:41:33,481 --> 01:41:35,858
Are you trying to tell me
that I'm irresistible?

1282
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:38,527
I'm trying to remind you
that it's your responsibility...

1283
01:41:38,611 --> 01:41:41,280
...to help us restore her
to Vandamm's good graces...

1284
01:41:41,365 --> 01:41:43,450
...until he leaves the country tonight.

1285
01:41:44,283 --> 01:41:45,577
All right, all right.

1286
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:47,746
But, after tonight....

1287
01:41:48,747 --> 01:41:50,749
My blessings on you both!

1288
01:42:05,389 --> 01:42:06,348
Here they are!

1289
01:43:00,443 --> 01:43:01,903
Good afternoon, Mr. Kaplan.

1290
01:43:01,986 --> 01:43:02,987
Not her!

1291
01:43:12,580 --> 01:43:15,375
Did I misunderstand you
about bringing her here?

1292
01:43:15,459 --> 01:43:17,668
We'll get to that later.

1293
01:43:18,462 --> 01:43:20,672
I suppose you were surprised
to get my call.

1294
01:43:20,755 --> 01:43:24,508
Not at all. I knew the police
would release you, Mr. Kaplan.

1295
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:27,804
By the way, I want to compliment you
on your colorful exit...

1296
01:43:27,888 --> 01:43:29,848
...from the auction gallery.

1297
01:43:30,222 --> 01:43:31,390
Thank you.

1298
01:43:31,474 --> 01:43:34,518
And now what little drama
are we here for today?

1299
01:43:34,602 --> 01:43:38,481
I don't for a moment believe that
you invited me to these gay surroundings...

1300
01:43:38,522 --> 01:43:40,816
...to come to a business arrangement.

1301
01:43:42,361 --> 01:43:46,698
Suppose I tell you that I not only know
when you're leaving the country tonight...

1302
01:43:46,781 --> 01:43:49,325
...but the latitude and longitude
of your rendezvous...

1303
01:43:49,408 --> 01:43:51,494
...and your ultimate destination.

1304
01:43:51,954 --> 01:43:54,580
You wouldn't care to carry my bags,
would you?

1305
01:43:54,831 --> 01:43:57,960
Perhaps you'd be interested in the price,
just the same.

1306
01:43:58,168 --> 01:43:59,252
The price?

1307
01:43:59,335 --> 01:44:01,338
For doing nothing to stop you.

1308
01:44:02,963 --> 01:44:05,258
How much did you have in mind?

1309
01:44:05,883 --> 01:44:07,009
I want the girl.

1310
01:44:09,970 --> 01:44:12,014
I want her to get what's coming to her.

1311
01:44:13,057 --> 01:44:16,644
Turn her over to me. I'll see there's
enough pinned on her to keep her...

1312
01:44:16,728 --> 01:44:18,855
...uncomfortable for the rest of her life.

1313
01:44:20,107 --> 01:44:22,985
You do that,
and I'll look the other way tonight.

1314
01:44:23,526 --> 01:44:25,486
She really did get under your skin.

1315
01:44:25,861 --> 01:44:28,739
We're not talking about my skin.
We're talking about yours.

1316
01:44:28,781 --> 01:44:32,118
-I'm offering you a chance to save it.
-To exchange it!

1317
01:44:33,412 --> 01:44:34,787
Put it any way you like.

1318
01:44:35,287 --> 01:44:37,331
I'm curious, Mr. Kaplan.

1319
01:44:37,873 --> 01:44:42,169
What made you think that my feelings
for her may have deteriorated...

1320
01:44:42,253 --> 01:44:45,589
...to the point where I would trade her in
for a little peace of mind?

1321
01:44:46,925 --> 01:44:48,384
I don't deduce.

1322
01:44:48,592 --> 01:44:49,719
I observe.

1323
01:44:52,431 --> 01:44:55,725
Phillip, if you don't mind,
I'm going back to the house now.

1324
01:45:08,195 --> 01:45:09,405
Just a second, you.

1325
01:45:09,447 --> 01:45:12,366
Stay away from me! Let go!
Let go of me!

1326
01:45:13,451 --> 01:45:15,453
Stay away from me! Let go!

1327
01:45:15,619 --> 01:45:16,871
Let go of me!

1328
01:45:17,456 --> 01:45:18,914
Save the phony tears.

1329
01:45:18,956 --> 01:45:20,459
You just get back.

1330
01:45:22,710 --> 01:45:23,794
You little fool!

1331
01:45:23,878 --> 01:45:25,672
You just stay away from me.

1332
01:45:31,302 --> 01:45:33,512
No good. You can't get involved in this.

1333
01:45:38,060 --> 01:45:40,187
-Don't touch anything.
-Stand back.

1334
01:45:40,519 --> 01:45:41,438
Stand back.

1335
01:46:42,708 --> 01:46:44,001
Don't be long.

1336
01:46:47,921 --> 01:46:48,964
Hello.

1337
01:46:50,297 --> 01:46:51,340
Hello.

1338
01:46:52,175 --> 01:46:53,551
Are you all right?

1339
01:46:54,802 --> 01:46:56,346
Yes, I think so.

1340
01:46:56,929 --> 01:46:59,641
I asked the Professor
if I could see you again.

1341
01:47:02,101 --> 01:47:03,978
There's not much time.

1342
01:47:05,438 --> 01:47:06,773
Isn't there?

1343
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:09,567
I wanted to tell you....

1344
01:47:09,943 --> 01:47:11,402
I mean, apologize.

1345
01:47:12,904 --> 01:47:13,989
No need.

1346
01:47:15,406 --> 01:47:16,741
I understand.

1347
01:47:19,202 --> 01:47:20,870
All in the line of duty.

1348
01:47:22,456 --> 01:47:24,541
I did treat you miserably.

1349
01:47:26,752 --> 01:47:28,461
I hated you for it.

1350
01:47:29,211 --> 01:47:31,255
I didn't want you to go on thinking....

1351
01:47:34,091 --> 01:47:36,552
I used some pretty harsh words, I'm sorry.

1352
01:47:36,970 --> 01:47:39,680
-They hurt deeply.
-Naturally, if I'd known....

1353
01:47:40,098 --> 01:47:41,724
I couldn't tell you.

1354
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:43,976
-Of course not.
-Could l?

1355
01:47:45,853 --> 01:47:47,229
No, I guess not.

1356
01:47:49,273 --> 01:47:51,568
You didn't get hurt. I'm so relieved.

1357
01:47:51,652 --> 01:47:53,612
Of course I was. How would you have felt?

1358
01:47:53,654 --> 01:47:57,114
I mean in the cafeteria, when you fell.
When I shot you with the blanks.

1359
01:47:57,198 --> 01:47:58,699
Oh, that. No.

1360
01:47:59,617 --> 01:48:01,577
You did it rather well, I thought.

1361
01:48:01,619 --> 01:48:03,913
Yes, I thought I was quite graceful.

1362
01:48:04,497 --> 01:48:07,083
Considering it's not really
your kind of work.

1363
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:11,837
No, I got into it by accident.
What's your excuse?

1364
01:48:14,090 --> 01:48:17,927
I met Phillip Vandamm at a party one night
and saw only his charm.

1365
01:48:21,389 --> 01:48:24,308
I guess I had nothing to do that weekend...

1366
01:48:24,350 --> 01:48:26,644
...so I decided to fall in love.

1367
01:48:27,269 --> 01:48:28,604
That's nice.

1368
01:48:30,398 --> 01:48:34,403
Eventually, the Professor and his
Washington colleagues approached me...

1369
01:48:35,903 --> 01:48:39,616
...with a few sordid details about Phillip
and he told me that...

1370
01:48:40,617 --> 01:48:44,578
...my relationship with him
made me "uniquely valuable" to them.

1371
01:48:46,288 --> 01:48:48,290
So you became a Girl Scout?

1372
01:48:49,542 --> 01:48:52,837
It was the first time anyone ever asked me
to do anything worthwhile.

1373
01:48:55,215 --> 01:48:56,632
Has life been like that?

1374
01:48:59,885 --> 01:49:00,720
How come?

1375
01:49:03,515 --> 01:49:04,725
Men like you.

1376
01:49:06,392 --> 01:49:08,687
What's wrong with men like me?

1377
01:49:08,978 --> 01:49:11,272
They don't believe in marriage.

1378
01:49:11,355 --> 01:49:13,149
I've been married twice.

1379
01:49:13,190 --> 01:49:14,525
See what I mean?

1380
01:49:16,777 --> 01:49:19,488
I may go back to hating you.
It was more fun.

1381
01:49:26,329 --> 01:49:27,913
Goodbye, darling.

1382
01:49:29,290 --> 01:49:30,458
Wait. Not so soon.

1383
01:49:30,834 --> 01:49:32,669
I must get back and convince them...

1384
01:49:32,753 --> 01:49:35,756
...that I took the long way
so nobody would follow me.

1385
01:49:37,798 --> 01:49:40,177
Couldn't we stand like this
for just a few hours?

1386
01:49:40,218 --> 01:49:42,803
Just this time you're supposed
to be critically wounded!

1387
01:49:42,887 --> 01:49:44,555
I never felt more alive.

1388
01:49:44,930 --> 01:49:46,224
Whose side are you on?

1389
01:49:47,476 --> 01:49:48,809
Yours, always, darling.

1390
01:49:49,935 --> 01:49:53,482
Please don't undermine my resolve,
just when I need it most.

1391
01:50:02,074 --> 01:50:05,910
I guess it's off to the hospital for me
and back to danger for you.

1392
01:50:06,078 --> 01:50:07,828
I don't like it a bit.

1393
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:11,582
It's much safer now, thanks to you,
my darling decoy.

1394
01:50:12,166 --> 01:50:14,378
Don't thank me. I couldn't stand it.

1395
01:50:14,419 --> 01:50:16,128
All right. I won't.

1396
01:50:16,212 --> 01:50:19,423
After your malevolent friend Vandamm
takes off tonight...

1397
01:50:19,591 --> 01:50:23,720
...we'll get together and do a lot of
apologizing to each other, in private.

1398
01:50:23,845 --> 01:50:25,388
You know that can't be.

1399
01:50:25,429 --> 01:50:27,223
Of course it can be!

1400
01:50:30,476 --> 01:50:32,561
He has told you, hasn't he?

1401
01:50:33,105 --> 01:50:34,314
Told me what?

1402
01:50:34,939 --> 01:50:36,400
You've got to get moving.

1403
01:50:37,359 --> 01:50:39,569
-What didn't you tell me?
-Why didn't you?

1404
01:50:40,612 --> 01:50:43,447
She's going off with Vandamm tonight
on the plane.

1405
01:50:45,491 --> 01:50:47,076
She's going off with Vandamm?

1406
01:50:47,118 --> 01:50:50,538
That's why we went to such lengths
to make her a fugitive from justice.

1407
01:50:50,621 --> 01:50:53,457
So that Vandamm couldn't decline
to take her along.

1408
01:50:53,624 --> 01:50:56,544
I needn't tell you how valuable
she can be to us over there.

1409
01:50:57,296 --> 01:50:59,547
You lied to me!
You said that after tonight--

1410
01:50:59,755 --> 01:51:00,965
I needed your help.

1411
01:51:01,048 --> 01:51:02,342
You got it, all right.

1412
01:51:02,426 --> 01:51:03,635
Don't be angry.

1413
01:51:03,718 --> 01:51:06,638
-You think I'll let you go through with this?
-She has to.

1414
01:51:06,971 --> 01:51:08,807
Nobody has to do anything!

1415
01:51:08,973 --> 01:51:10,975
I don't like the games you play!

1416
01:51:11,977 --> 01:51:14,855
War is hell, Mr. Thornhill,
even when it's a cold one.

1417
01:51:15,856 --> 01:51:18,191
If you can't lick the Vandamms
of this world...

1418
01:51:18,649 --> 01:51:21,569
...without asking girls to bed down
and fly away with them...

1419
01:51:21,777 --> 01:51:23,447
...and probably never come back...

1420
01:51:23,529 --> 01:51:26,283
...perhaps you should learn
how to lose a few cold wars.

1421
01:51:26,907 --> 01:51:28,368
We're already doing that.

1422
01:51:36,042 --> 01:51:39,754
-I won't let you do this. Get out.
-Please don't spoil everything.

1423
01:51:45,260 --> 01:51:49,514
...shot Mr. Kaplan twice in full view
of horrified men, women and children...

1424
01:51:49,597 --> 01:51:52,975
...who had come to the park
to see the famed Mt. Rushmore monument.

1425
01:51:53,017 --> 01:51:58,649
Witnesses described the assailant as
an attractive blonde in her late twenties.

1426
01:51:58,857 --> 01:52:02,693
Kaplan, who was taken to the hospital
in critical condition...

1427
01:52:02,778 --> 01:52:06,864
...has been tentatively identified
as an employee of the federal government.

1428
01:52:06,949 --> 01:52:09,533
The tragedy developed
with startling suddenness.

1429
01:52:09,617 --> 01:52:12,787
Chris Swenson,
a busboy in the Mt. Rushmore cafeteria...

1430
01:52:12,870 --> 01:52:15,831
...stated that he heard voices raised in--

1431
01:52:21,921 --> 01:52:23,089
Here we are.

1432
01:52:24,173 --> 01:52:26,509
Slacks, a shirt and these.

1433
01:52:27,052 --> 01:52:28,260
Thanks.

1434
01:52:28,344 --> 01:52:31,597
That'll do for you around here
for the next couple of days.

1435
01:52:32,598 --> 01:52:34,558
The next couple of days?

1436
01:52:35,768 --> 01:52:37,229
Hey, what's this?

1437
01:52:37,937 --> 01:52:41,190
That's where I hit the chair
doing that phony fall in the cafeteria.

1438
01:52:41,232 --> 01:52:43,652
You and your dopey schemes. Shooting.

1439
01:52:43,735 --> 01:52:46,697
-Otherwise, feeling all right?
-Oh, yes. Fine.

1440
01:52:47,571 --> 01:52:50,784
Considering your driver has
a sledgehammer for a hand.

1441
01:52:50,951 --> 01:52:52,785
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

1442
01:52:52,953 --> 01:52:55,496
That's all right. I guess I deserved it.

1443
01:52:56,248 --> 01:52:58,582
I guess I deserve that locked door, too.

1444
01:52:58,666 --> 01:53:02,504
If you were seen wandering about healthy,
it could prove fatal to Miss Kendall.

1445
01:53:03,505 --> 01:53:06,215
-I've begun to forget her already.
-Good.

1446
01:53:06,757 --> 01:53:08,926
-Better that way.
-Yeah, much.

1447
01:53:09,385 --> 01:53:11,554
Inside of an hour, she'll be gone.

1448
01:53:14,598 --> 01:53:16,475
How's everything out in Rapid City?

1449
01:53:16,559 --> 01:53:18,227
Everything's fine.

1450
01:53:18,602 --> 01:53:22,440
Mr. Kaplan's untimely shooting has
acquired the authority of the printed word.

1451
01:53:22,940 --> 01:53:25,360
Everyone's been cooperating beautifully.

1452
01:53:25,444 --> 01:53:26,819
Now you can include me.

1453
01:53:27,529 --> 01:53:29,697
-I'm a cooperator.
-I'm most grateful.

1454
01:53:30,490 --> 01:53:33,493
-Care to do me a favor in return?
-Anything.

1455
01:53:33,577 --> 01:53:36,287
I'd like a drink.
Will you get me some bourbon?

1456
01:53:36,663 --> 01:53:38,080
A pint will do.

1457
01:53:38,915 --> 01:53:40,082
Can I join you?

1458
01:53:40,124 --> 01:53:43,419
If you're gonna join me,
you better make it a quart.

1459
01:53:43,461 --> 01:53:45,213
See you in a few minutes.

1460
01:54:50,569 --> 01:54:52,238
-Stop!
-Excuse me.

1461
01:54:53,531 --> 01:54:54,532
Stop.

1462
01:55:18,723 --> 01:55:22,810
-Don't you want me to take you up there?
-No, thanks. Never mind. This is fine.

1463
01:58:08,018 --> 01:58:11,063
-There's nothing to worry about.
-I just lost my head.

1464
01:58:11,646 --> 01:58:14,440
I'm not just saying this
to make you feel better.

1465
01:58:14,607 --> 01:58:15,816
I mean it.

1466
01:58:16,276 --> 01:58:18,362
I just didn't know what I was doing.

1467
01:58:18,445 --> 01:58:21,072
He wants to destroy you.
You had to protect yourself.

1468
01:58:21,155 --> 01:58:22,657
But not endanger you!

1469
01:58:22,740 --> 01:58:23,699
Rubbish.

1470
01:58:24,283 --> 01:58:28,287
Soon we'll be off together and I shall
dedicate myself to your happiness.

1471
01:58:29,915 --> 01:58:31,833
What's the situation, Leonard?

1472
01:58:32,083 --> 01:58:34,335
-About the plane, you mean?
-Of course.

1473
01:58:34,418 --> 01:58:36,004
What was the last report?

1474
01:58:36,171 --> 01:58:39,216
Over Whitestone on the hour.
6,000. Descending.

1475
01:58:39,465 --> 01:58:41,550
-About ten minutes?
-At the most.

1476
01:58:42,635 --> 01:58:43,719
And now....

1477
01:58:44,471 --> 01:58:47,474
I wonder if I might have a few words
of parting with you, sir?

1478
01:58:47,557 --> 01:58:48,766
Certainly.

1479
01:58:49,601 --> 01:58:50,893
In private?

1480
01:58:52,395 --> 01:58:53,605
I'll get my things.

1481
01:58:56,273 --> 01:58:58,026
How does one say goodbye...

1482
01:58:58,359 --> 01:58:59,903
...to one's right arm?

1483
01:59:06,617 --> 01:59:09,161
In your case,
you'll wish you had cut it off sooner.

1484
01:59:13,916 --> 01:59:16,168
I know you're terribly fond
of Miss Kendall....

1485
02:00:01,590 --> 02:00:03,592
It couldn't have been anything.

1486
02:00:06,969 --> 02:00:09,638
You must've had some doubts
about her yourself.

1487
02:00:11,182 --> 02:00:12,183
And still do.

1488
02:00:12,516 --> 02:00:13,643
Rubbish.

1489
02:00:14,268 --> 02:00:16,812
Why else would you've decided
not to tell her that...

1490
02:00:17,105 --> 02:00:19,815
...our little treasure here
has a bellyful of microfilm?

1491
02:00:19,899 --> 02:00:22,527
You seem to be trying to fill mine
with rotten apples.

1492
02:00:22,610 --> 02:00:25,321
Sometimes the truth does taste
like worms.

1493
02:00:25,364 --> 02:00:27,281
I've heard nothing but innuendoes.

1494
02:00:27,365 --> 02:00:31,077
Call it my "woman's intuition" if you will,
but I've never trusted neatness.

1495
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:33,705
Neatness is always the result
of deliberate planning.

1496
02:00:33,789 --> 02:00:36,248
She shot him in a moment
of fear and anger.

1497
02:00:36,415 --> 02:00:38,292
You were there, you saw it yourself.

1498
02:00:38,542 --> 02:00:39,460
Yes.

1499
02:00:41,796 --> 02:00:45,883
And thereby wrapped everything up
into one very neat and tidy bundle.

1500
02:00:48,135 --> 02:00:50,971
A: She removed any doubts
you may have had about her.

1501
02:00:51,055 --> 02:00:53,684
What did you call it? Her "devotion"?

1502
02:00:53,933 --> 02:00:58,062
B: She gave herself an urgent reason
to be taken to the other side with you...

1503
02:00:58,145 --> 02:01:00,314
...in case you decided to change your mind.

1504
02:01:02,858 --> 02:01:04,485
I think you're jealous.

1505
02:01:04,735 --> 02:01:06,862
No, I mean it. I'm very touched.

1506
02:01:10,700 --> 02:01:11,826
Leonard!

1507
02:01:19,291 --> 02:01:20,877
The gun she shot Kaplan with.

1508
02:01:21,585 --> 02:01:23,005
I found it in her luggage.

1509
02:01:24,380 --> 02:01:28,342
It's an old trick. Shoot one of your own
to show that you're not one of them.

1510
02:01:28,884 --> 02:01:31,679
They've just freshened it up a bit
with blank cartridges.

1511
02:01:45,902 --> 02:01:47,069
What was that noise?

1512
02:01:49,948 --> 02:01:52,951
Yes, we wondered what it was, too.
Didn't we, Leonard?

1513
02:01:54,286 --> 02:01:56,412
Hurry down, darling. It's time to leave.

1514
02:01:56,871 --> 02:01:57,872
In a moment.

1515
02:02:07,173 --> 02:02:09,635
You're not taking her on that plane
with you?

1516
02:02:09,676 --> 02:02:10,844
Of course I am.

1517
02:02:12,012 --> 02:02:15,057
Like our friends,
l, too, believe in neatness, Leonard.

1518
02:02:15,848 --> 02:02:19,102
This matter is best disposed of
from a great height...

1519
02:02:20,062 --> 02:02:21,271
...over water.

1520
02:03:08,318 --> 02:03:10,486
How about a little champagne
before we go?

1521
02:03:10,569 --> 02:03:11,904
I'd love it.

1522
02:03:12,029 --> 02:03:13,614
It may not be cold enough.

1523
02:03:13,698 --> 02:03:15,450
On the rocks it'll be all right.

1524
02:03:15,534 --> 02:03:16,660
Are you sure?

1525
02:03:27,712 --> 02:03:28,838
R.O.T.

1526
02:03:44,854 --> 02:03:46,939
They're on to you.

1527
02:03:52,070 --> 02:03:54,697
I'm in your room.

1528
02:04:33,654 --> 02:04:34,738
To you, my dear...

1529
02:04:34,821 --> 02:04:37,239
...and all the lovely moments
we've had together.

1530
02:04:38,366 --> 02:04:39,200
Thank you.

1531
02:04:40,284 --> 02:04:41,160
There he is.

1532
02:04:49,085 --> 02:04:51,463
Jump in, Leonard. The champagne's fine.

1533
02:04:51,837 --> 02:04:53,382
There isn't time.

1534
02:04:53,465 --> 02:04:55,966
You always were a spoilsport, weren't you?

1535
02:04:56,384 --> 02:04:58,302
One of my most valuable attributes...

1536
02:04:58,469 --> 02:04:59,805
...as it now turns out.

1537
02:05:02,306 --> 02:05:06,268
It would please me if you'd think of me
as being along on this journey...

1538
02:05:06,979 --> 02:05:08,521
...if only in spirit.

1539
02:05:08,688 --> 02:05:09,689
I shall.

1540
02:05:17,697 --> 02:05:20,742
He's heading pretty far out
on the north flag and awfully high.

1541
02:05:21,826 --> 02:05:25,121
I guess he's going to play it safe
with a long, slow descent.

1542
02:05:26,163 --> 02:05:28,499
You couldn't ask
for a better night than this.

1543
02:05:28,582 --> 02:05:30,835
Ceiling and possibilities unlimited.

1544
02:05:32,963 --> 02:05:35,173
There he goes, starting his turn.

1545
02:05:36,507 --> 02:05:38,134
We'd better get moving.

1546
02:05:40,052 --> 02:05:43,432
He should have his wheels on the ground
inside of three minutes.

1547
02:05:47,435 --> 02:05:49,270
-Come along, Eve.
-All right.

1548
02:05:51,732 --> 02:05:55,110
I think I left my earrings upstairs.
I'll be right down.

1549
02:06:08,247 --> 02:06:10,916
We can go through the window.
There's a car downstairs!

1550
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,252
What are you doing?
You'll ruin everything!

1551
02:06:13,336 --> 02:06:15,881
They know about the fake shooting!
They'll kill you!

1552
02:06:15,964 --> 02:06:17,049
What?

1553
02:06:17,173 --> 02:06:19,342
Leonard found the gun in your luggage!

1554
02:06:19,467 --> 02:06:22,678
The figure they got at the auction
is filled with microfilm!

1555
02:06:22,762 --> 02:06:25,182
That's how he's been getting it.

1556
02:06:26,015 --> 02:06:28,142
Whatever you do, don't get on that plane!

1557
02:06:35,692 --> 02:06:38,737
Don't worry, Anna.
Arrangements have been made.

1558
02:06:38,986 --> 02:06:41,697
You and your husband will be
in Canada by morning.

1559
02:06:41,739 --> 02:06:43,699
-Thank you very much, sir.
-Be careful.

1560
02:06:43,741 --> 02:06:44,533
We will.

1561
02:06:44,952 --> 02:06:45,953
God bless you!

1562
02:07:51,475 --> 02:07:52,643
Stay where you are!

1563
02:08:04,281 --> 02:08:05,240
Sit down.

1564
02:08:10,119 --> 02:08:13,456
As soon as the plane leaves,
my husband and Mr. Leonard will be back.

1565
02:08:41,567 --> 02:08:42,861
What is it?

1566
02:08:44,195 --> 02:08:45,989
I was wondering about my earrings.

1567
02:08:46,073 --> 02:08:47,448
They'll turn up.

1568
02:08:51,952 --> 02:08:54,955
When you return to New York,
say goodbye to my sister.

1569
02:08:55,290 --> 02:08:57,626
Thank her for her performance
as Mrs. Townsend.

1570
02:08:58,669 --> 02:09:02,088
Tell your knife-throwing chum
that I've reassured his wife.

1571
02:09:02,673 --> 02:09:03,923
That's all, Leonard.

1572
02:09:19,814 --> 02:09:21,023
Get that figure back!

1573
02:09:28,280 --> 02:09:30,701
The housekeeper had me pinned down
for five minutes...

1574
02:09:30,784 --> 02:09:33,160
...before I realized
it was that silly gun of yours.

1575
02:09:33,244 --> 02:09:35,038
-I see you've got the pumpkin.
-Yes.

1576
02:10:14,536 --> 02:10:17,246
This is no good.
We're on top of the monument.

1577
02:10:35,432 --> 02:10:37,183
-What'll we do?
-Climb down.

1578
02:10:37,266 --> 02:10:38,225
We can't.

1579
02:10:38,351 --> 02:10:40,519
Here they come. We have no choice.

1580
02:11:30,319 --> 02:11:32,238
If we ever get out of this alive...

1581
02:11:32,321 --> 02:11:34,783
...let's go back to New York
on the train together.

1582
02:11:34,866 --> 02:11:35,993
All right?

1583
02:11:36,492 --> 02:11:38,078
Is that a proposition?

1584
02:11:39,370 --> 02:11:41,164
It's a proposal, sweetie.

1585
02:11:42,374 --> 02:11:44,834
What happened to the first two marriages?

1586
02:11:45,751 --> 02:11:47,546
My wives divorced me.

1587
02:11:48,087 --> 02:11:48,921
Why?

1588
02:11:49,005 --> 02:11:51,550
I think they said I led too dull a life.

1589
02:11:52,676 --> 02:11:53,509
Come on.

1590
02:12:03,894 --> 02:12:04,979
Are you all right?

1591
02:12:15,574 --> 02:12:16,533
Come on.

1592
02:15:07,411 --> 02:15:08,162
Help!

1593
02:15:08,664 --> 02:15:09,790
Help me!

1594
02:15:41,612 --> 02:15:42,780
Thank you, Sergeant.

1595
02:15:42,863 --> 02:15:45,616
That wasn't very sporting,
using real bullets?

1596
02:15:45,908 --> 02:15:47,369
Here, reach. Now.

1597
02:15:48,619 --> 02:15:49,745
I'm trying.

1598
02:15:49,954 --> 02:15:51,247
Come on, I've got you.

1599
02:15:51,373 --> 02:15:53,417
-Up!
-I can't make it!

1600
02:15:53,791 --> 02:15:54,750
Yes, you can.

1601
02:15:54,792 --> 02:15:55,585
Come on.

1602
02:15:55,627 --> 02:15:56,545
Pull harder!

1603
02:15:56,961 --> 02:15:58,588
Come along, Mrs. Thornhill.

1604
02:16:02,968 --> 02:16:04,593
Roger, this is silly.

1605
02:16:04,987 --> 02:16:06,987
I know, but I'm sentimental.
