<i>A philosopher once asked,</i>

3
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:46,543
<i>"Are we human
because we gaze at the stars,</i>

4
00:00:46,653 --> 00:00:50,384
<i>"or do we gaze at them
because we are human?"</i>

5
00:00:51,258 --> 00:00:52,885
<i>Pointless, really.</i>

6
00:00:53,727 --> 00:00:55,854
<i>Do the stars gaze back?</i>

7
00:00:56,897 --> 00:00:58,728
<i>Now, that's a question.</i>

8
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,534
<i>But I'm getting ahead of myself.</i>

9
00:01:02,636 --> 00:01:05,799
<i>Our story really begins here,</i>

10
00:01:05,906 --> 00:01:09,535
<i>150 years ago
at the Royal Academy of Science</i>

11
00:01:09,643 --> 00:01:11,941
<i>in London, England,</i>

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,783
<i>where a letter arrived,
containing a very strange inquiry.</i>

13
00:01:19,153 --> 00:01:21,883
<i>It had come from a country boy</i>

14
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:27,154
<i>and the scientist who read it thought it
might be a practical joke of some kind.</i>

15
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:29,889
<i>But he duly wrote a reply</i>

16
00:01:29,997 --> 00:01:33,160
<i>politely explaining
that the query was nonsense.</i>

17
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:39,233
<i>And posted it to the boy
who lived in a village called Wall,</i>

18
00:01:39,339 --> 00:01:43,435
<i>so named, the boy had said,
for the wall that ran alongside it.</i>

19
00:01:43,544 --> 00:01:49,505
<i>A wall that, according to local folklore,
hid an extraordinary secret.</i>

20
00:01:49,616 --> 00:01:54,074
I'm charged with guarding the portal
to another world.

21
00:01:54,186 --> 00:01:58,623
And you're asking me
to just let you through?

22
00:01:58,723 --> 00:02:02,625
Yes.
Because, let's be honest, it's a field.

23
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:06,094
Look, do you see
another world out there?

24
00:02:06,198 --> 00:02:10,794
No. You see a field.
Do you see anything nonhuman?

25
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:14,394
No. And you know why?
Because it's a field!

26
00:02:14,506 --> 00:02:17,737
Hundreds of years,
this wall's been here.

27
00:02:17,843 --> 00:02:22,610
Hundreds of years,
this gap's been under 24-hour guard.

28
00:02:22,714 --> 00:02:25,547
- Well...
- One more word,

29
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,609
and I'll have you up
in front of the village council!

30
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:34,421
- Well, that sounds rather final.
- Yeah.

31
00:02:35,861 --> 00:02:40,855
- Better just go home, then, I suppose.
- Right, then. Night, Dunstan.

32
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,827
Give my best to your father.

33
00:02:46,004 --> 00:02:47,130
Stop!

34
00:02:49,574 --> 00:02:50,666
Stop!

35
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,814
I don't deal with time-wasters.

36
00:03:37,923 --> 00:03:39,720
Get over here and tend this stall.

37
00:03:39,824 --> 00:03:42,759
I'm off to The Slaughtered Prince
for a pint.

38
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,931
See anything you like?

39
00:03:53,538 --> 00:03:55,403
Definitely.

40
00:03:55,507 --> 00:04:00,171
I mean, what I meant was these ones,
the blue ones.

41
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:02,740
How much are they?

42
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:05,714
They might be the color of your hair.

43
00:04:05,817 --> 00:04:09,947
Or they might be all of your memories
before you were three.

44
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:12,319
I can check if you like.

45
00:04:12,424 --> 00:04:16,859
Anyway, you shouldn't buy the bluebells.
Buy this one instead.

46
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,125
Snowdrop.

47
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,995
It'll bring you luck.

48
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:26,301
But what does that cost?

49
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,937
This one costs a kiss.

50
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:51,560
Is she gone?

51
00:04:53,563 --> 00:04:54,860
Follow me.

52
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:10,973
I'm a princess,
tricked into being a witch's slave.

53
00:05:11,414 --> 00:05:12,938
Will you liberate me?

54
00:05:22,158 --> 00:05:25,685
It's an enchanted chain.
I'll only be free when she dies.

55
00:05:28,097 --> 00:05:29,121
Sorry.

56
00:05:29,232 --> 00:05:32,929
Well, if I can't liberate you,
what do you want of me?

57
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:53,278
<i>So, the scientist was wrong.</i>

58
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:57,251
<i>The wall had successfully done its job</i>

59
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,626
<i>of hiding
the magical kingdom of Stormhold.</i>

60
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:05,599
<i>The young man returned that night
to his home in England,</i>

61
00:06:05,702 --> 00:06:08,933
<i>hoping that his adventure
would soon be forgotten.</i>

62
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:13,998
<i>But nine months later,
he received an unexpected souvenir.</i>

63
00:06:22,585 --> 00:06:27,648
This was left at the wall for you.
It says here his name is Tristan.

64
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,646
Tristan? Don't forget the flowers.

65
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:57,343
Yes. I've got them. Thank you, Father.

66
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:03,156
<i>Eighteen years passed,
and the baby Tristan grew up</i>

67
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:06,590
<i>knowing nothing
of his unconventional heritage.</i>

68
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:12,327
<i>But never mind
how the infant became a boy.</i>

69
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:16,733
<i>This is the story of
how Tristan Thorn becomes a man,</i>

70
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:20,096
<i>a much greater challenge altogether.</i>

71
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,406
<i>For to achieve it,</i>

72
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:27,572
<i>he must win the heart
of his one true love.</i>

73
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,581
- It's him!
- It's him!

74
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,757
Humphrey?

75
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:37,018
Humphrey?

76
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,616
No, it's Tristan.

77
00:07:42,096 --> 00:07:44,155
Did I leave something at the shop?

78
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:46,699
No. I just thought I could bring...

79
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:50,162
Tristan Thorn,

80
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,172
shop boy by day, peeping Tom by night.

81
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:55,538
Is there no end to your charms?

82
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:58,671
Humphrey,
there's no need to be like that.

83
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,713
Be nice to the poor boy.

84
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:03,950
Were those for Victoria?

85
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,327
You were always useless at fencing
in school, Tristan.

86
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:24,768
In fact, I'm having trouble remembering
if there was anything you were good at.

87
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:27,272
Humphrey, that's enough.

88
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:34,005
Are you all right?

89
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,342
Yeah. Yeah, fine.

90
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,337
- Want some breakfast?
- No, I'm really late for work.

91
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:04,170
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Fine. Why?

92
00:09:04,276 --> 00:09:08,770
Oh, I don't know.
Last night, how'd it go?

93
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,282
Oh, really good. Really, really good.

94
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:28,830
Hello, Tristan.

95
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:31,425
- Victoria.
- Pound of sugar, please.

96
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,566
- Yes.
- Let's see, a bag of flour, a dozen eggs.

97
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:40,736
Oh, look, I'm sorry about last night.
Humphrey was really rude.

98
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:44,441
I also need a sack of potatoes
and some chocolate, please.

99
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,688
May I perhaps see you tonight?

100
00:09:52,157 --> 00:09:54,216
No, but you may walk me home.

101
00:09:55,527 --> 00:09:56,619
Now?

102
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,290
Yes. Yes, I can.

103
00:10:06,638 --> 00:10:08,469
Father, I lost my job.

104
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,840
Father, I don't... I lost my job. I'm sorry.

105
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,140
- Father...
- You lost your job.

106
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,506
Yes, so I heard.

107
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,650
Father, I'm sorry. I...

108
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,588
Maybe Mr. Monday was right.
Maybe I am deluding myself.

109
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,922
- I'm not good enough for Victoria.
- He said that? That's poppycock.

110
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:30,790
You really want to know
how it went last night?

111
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:31,988
Yeah.

112
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,160
Not good.

113
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:37,658
Come on. I'm wasting my time.

114
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,201
I'm not like Humphrey.

115
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:45,676
Tristan, I can tell you that every man
I ever envied when I was a boy

116
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:48,572
has led an unremarkable life.

117
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:54,311
So you don't fit with the popular crowd.
Now, I take that as a very good omen.

118
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:10,096
- Tristan, I clearly said...
- I know. You told me not to come.

119
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,796
I have something for you. A surprise.

120
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:14,997
No...

121
00:11:29,285 --> 00:11:32,379
It's not my birthday for another week,
you know.

122
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:39,292
- I've never had champagne before.
- Yeah, me, neither.

123
00:11:40,697 --> 00:11:43,063
My God! This is delicious!

124
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:47,735
How did... Well,
how does a shop boy afford all of this?

125
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:49,532
I'm not a shop boy.

126
00:11:50,473 --> 00:11:52,668
God! I heard. I'm sorry.
What are you going to do now?

127
00:11:52,776 --> 00:11:56,542
No. I mean, I'm not a shop boy.
I was just working in a shop.

128
00:11:56,646 --> 00:11:59,877
And now I'm not.
Now I'm free to live my life as I wish.

129
00:11:59,983 --> 00:12:02,451
This must have been all your savings.

130
00:12:02,552 --> 00:12:05,578
So? I can make more.
That's the beauty of it.

131
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:07,281
I never intended to stay in Wall,
Victoria.

132
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,723
There's a big world out there,
I'm gonna make my fortune.

133
00:12:10,827 --> 00:12:13,455
Now you sound just like Humphrey.
He's quite a traveler.

134
00:12:13,563 --> 00:12:17,795
Do you know he's going all the way
to lpswich just to buy me a ring?

135
00:12:17,901 --> 00:12:19,334
Lpswich?

136
00:12:19,436 --> 00:12:23,395
Victoria, I'm talking about London
or Paris or...

137
00:12:23,506 --> 00:12:27,306
A ring? Why is he...
What kind of a ring?

138
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,277
The word is he's planning to propose
to me on my birthday.

139
00:12:30,413 --> 00:12:31,971
He's going to...

140
00:12:33,316 --> 00:12:34,715
And you're gonna say yes.

141
00:12:34,818 --> 00:12:38,345
I can't exactly say no
after he's gone all the way to lpswich.

142
00:12:38,455 --> 00:12:40,548
"All the way to lpswich"?

143
00:12:40,657 --> 00:12:45,560
Victoria, for your hand in marriage,
I'd cross oceans or continents.

144
00:12:46,396 --> 00:12:47,886
- Really?
- Yes.

145
00:12:47,997 --> 00:12:49,396
Victoria, for your hand in marriage,

146
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:52,866
I would go to
the gold fields of San Francisco

147
00:12:52,969 --> 00:12:55,437
and bring you back your weight in gold.

148
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:57,567
I would.

149
00:12:58,508 --> 00:13:02,535
I'd go to Africa and bring you back
a diamond as big as your fist.

150
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,146
Or I'd go to the Arctic
and I'd slaughter a polar bear

151
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:08,376
and bring you back its head.

152
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:11,448
A polar bear's head?

153
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,990
You're funny, Tristan.

154
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:23,031
People like you and people like me,
we're just not...

155
00:13:26,903 --> 00:13:28,370
I should be going. It's really late.

156
00:13:28,471 --> 00:13:31,998
Well, hold on, then.
Let's at least finish the champagne.

157
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:34,301
Okay.

158
00:13:38,748 --> 00:13:42,741
<i>Had Tristan known then
how the stars watched Earth,</i>

159
00:13:42,852 --> 00:13:44,649
<i>he'd have shuddered at the very thought</i>

160
00:13:44,754 --> 00:13:47,154
<i>of an audience to his humiliation.</i>

161
00:13:49,626 --> 00:13:51,319
<i>But, fortunately for him,</i>

162
00:13:51,425 --> 00:13:54,394
<i>nearly every star in the sky
was at that moment</i>

163
00:13:54,495 --> 00:13:58,625
<i>looking in earnest at the land
on the other side of the wall,</i>

164
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:02,294
<i>where the King of all Stormhold
lay on his deathbed,</i>

165
00:14:02,403 --> 00:14:06,305
<i>which was a coincidence
because it was the King's final act</i>

166
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:11,777
<i>that would change the course
of Tristan's destiny forever.</i>

167
00:14:14,048 --> 00:14:15,948
Where is Secundus?

168
00:14:16,884 --> 00:14:18,943
He's on his way, Father.

169
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:20,748
Then we shall wait.

170
00:14:30,231 --> 00:14:34,395
Sorry I'm late, Father.
I came as swiftly as I was able.

171
00:14:39,307 --> 00:14:40,535
Septimus.

172
00:14:40,975 --> 00:14:42,169
Primus.

173
00:14:43,311 --> 00:14:44,505
Tertius.

174
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,648
So, to the matter of succession.

175
00:14:51,652 --> 00:14:56,555
Of my seven sons,
there are four of you today still standing.

176
00:14:56,657 --> 00:15:00,957
This is quite a break with tradition.
I had 12 brothers.

177
00:15:01,062 --> 00:15:02,859
And you killed them all for your throne

178
00:15:02,964 --> 00:15:05,990
before your father, the King,
even felt poorly.

179
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:09,567
We know, Father.
You're strong and courageous.

180
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,538
And cunning. Most importantly, cunning.

181
00:15:14,842 --> 00:15:18,005
- Secundus.
- Yes, Father?

182
00:15:18,112 --> 00:15:22,412
Look through the window.
Tell me what you see.

183
00:15:29,257 --> 00:15:31,282
I see the kingdom, Father.

184
00:15:33,027 --> 00:15:34,722
The whole of Stormhold.

185
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:38,526
- And?
- My kingdom?

186
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:41,033
Maybe. Look up.

187
00:16:07,061 --> 00:16:12,658
- Secundus.
- Sextus. Quartus. Quintus.

188
00:16:13,868 --> 00:16:17,962
You're alive. You're...

189
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,971
Stuck like this
till the new king is crowned.

190
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,935
I was that close.

191
00:16:24,043 --> 00:16:26,307
Well, at least
you haven't lost your looks.

192
00:16:26,412 --> 00:16:29,313
Oh, please. You're not annoyed
about that whole murder thing, are you?

193
00:16:29,415 --> 00:16:32,407
- I mean, that was 10 years ago.
- Yeah.

194
00:16:32,518 --> 00:16:34,418
Great deal of good it did you, didn't it,
killing me, Secundus?

195
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,785
Because now, of course,
now you are King of all Stormhold.

196
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,757
Oh, sorry. Wait. No, you're not.
You're dead.

197
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:44,022
Una? Una?

198
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:48,190
No, Father, it's me, your son.

199
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:50,329
Tertius.

200
00:16:52,738 --> 00:16:55,468
Where is your sister, Una?

201
00:16:55,574 --> 00:16:58,873
Sorry, Father.
Nobody has seen Una for years now.

202
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:01,173
- Septimus?
- What?

203
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,775
Tradition dictates the throne must pass
to a male heir.

204
00:17:06,885 --> 00:17:09,012
Exactly, Father.

205
00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:11,851
So why would I kill my sister
when these cretins are still alive?

206
00:17:11,957 --> 00:17:13,117
Indeed.

207
00:17:14,593 --> 00:17:20,463
Therefore, we shall resolve the situation
in a non-traditional manner.

208
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:49,526
Only he of royal blood
can restore the ruby.

209
00:17:49,628 --> 00:17:56,261
And the one of you that does so
shall be the new King of Stormhold.

210
00:18:46,883 --> 00:18:49,545
Oh, Tristan! A shooting star!

211
00:18:50,854 --> 00:18:52,151
Beautiful.

212
00:18:55,358 --> 00:18:58,327
More beautiful than a fancy ring
from lpswich?

213
00:19:01,131 --> 00:19:05,932
Victoria, for your hand in marriage,

214
00:19:06,036 --> 00:19:09,699
I'd cross the wall
and I'd bring you back that fallen star.

215
00:19:09,973 --> 00:19:11,964
You can't cross the wall.

216
00:19:12,342 --> 00:19:14,936
Nobody crosses the wall.
Now you're just being silly.

217
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:17,878
I'm not being silly. I'd do it.

218
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:21,640
For you, I'd do anything.

219
00:19:22,586 --> 00:19:24,520
My very own star.

220
00:19:28,225 --> 00:19:30,887
It seems we have ourselves
an agreement.

221
00:19:31,862 --> 00:19:35,229
You have exactly one week
or I'm marrying Humphrey.

222
00:20:47,404 --> 00:20:51,397
Mormo! Empusa! Wake up. Now!

223
00:20:52,442 --> 00:20:55,900
- What is it?
- A star has fallen.

224
00:21:03,785 --> 00:21:05,548
Where are the Babylon candles?

225
00:21:05,653 --> 00:21:10,352
You used the last one, Lamia,
200 years ago. Do you not recall?

226
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,093
Perhaps we can obtain another.

227
00:21:12,093 --> 00:21:12,718
Perhaps we can obtain another.

228
00:21:12,827 --> 00:21:16,263
Has your mind become
as decrepit as your face, Empusa?

229
00:21:16,364 --> 00:21:19,128
You speak as if such things
are freely available.

230
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:20,599
I know, sister, I merely thought...

231
00:21:20,702 --> 00:21:22,226
You'd have us hunting
for a Babylon candle

232
00:21:22,337 --> 00:21:25,101
while some other witch finds our star.

233
00:21:25,206 --> 00:21:27,800
Fool. There's no time to waste.

234
00:21:28,543 --> 00:21:31,341
If we must retrieve it on foot,
then we shall.

235
00:21:31,446 --> 00:21:33,539
Mormo, we need information.

236
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:47,659
If these divinations are correct,
the fallen star lies 100 miles away.

237
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:56,168
Four centuries we've waited for this.
What hardship a few more days?

238
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:59,707
Which of us shall go, then, to seek it
and bring it back?

239
00:22:07,849 --> 00:22:09,680
- I've his kidney.
- I've his liver.

240
00:22:09,784 --> 00:22:11,479
And I've his heart.

241
00:22:14,088 --> 00:22:17,114
You'll be needing
what's left of the last star.

242
00:22:24,098 --> 00:22:27,932
- There's not much left.
- Soon, there'll be plenty for us all.

243
00:23:24,325 --> 00:23:28,953
- Dunstan Thorn. Not again.
- It's Tristan, actually.

244
00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:33,788
Oh. You do look a bit like your father.

245
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:37,357
And I suppose you intend
to cross the wall as well, do you?

246
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,301
Well, you can forget it. Go home.

247
00:23:39,405 --> 00:23:41,566
Cross the wall as well as who?

248
00:23:42,408 --> 00:23:44,706
No one. Nobody.

249
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,278
Nobody crosses the wall.
You know that!

250
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,644
Everybody knows that!

251
00:23:49,749 --> 00:23:53,276
Yeah... No, no, I know.
I understand. Nobody.

252
00:23:55,087 --> 00:23:57,487
Well, I better just head
for the old homestead, then.

253
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,716
Yeah.

254
00:23:58,824 --> 00:24:02,988
- Right, then. Night, Tristan.
- Good night.

255
00:24:03,095 --> 00:24:05,188
Give my best to your father.

256
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,685
Off you go.

257
00:24:35,694 --> 00:24:39,027
I thought I heard you come in.
Hey, what happened? Are you hurt?

258
00:24:39,131 --> 00:24:40,359
No, I'm fine.

259
00:24:40,466 --> 00:24:41,956
- That Humphrey again?
- No.

260
00:24:42,067 --> 00:24:45,400
Actually, it was the guard.
The guard at the wall.

261
00:24:46,305 --> 00:24:47,704
Tristan, he's 97 years old.

262
00:24:47,807 --> 00:24:51,937
Well, that's given him plenty of time
to practice, then, hasn't it?

263
00:24:52,445 --> 00:24:55,608
Why, may I ask,
were you trying to cross the wall?

264
00:24:57,883 --> 00:25:00,181
I might ask you the same thing.

265
00:25:49,935 --> 00:25:51,525
I have a mother.

266
00:25:53,003 --> 00:25:55,938
I mean, I have a mother.
She could still be alive.

267
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:58,974
Oh, I hope so. I certainly like to think so.

268
00:26:02,913 --> 00:26:04,540
The chain you cut.

269
00:26:05,716 --> 00:26:07,047
Just like you said.

270
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,276
And...

271
00:26:11,421 --> 00:26:13,889
And the glass flower.
The flower she sold to you.

272
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:15,982
She told me it would bring me luck.

273
00:26:16,093 --> 00:26:17,390
Thank you.

274
00:26:19,196 --> 00:26:22,359
This was also in the basket.
I've never opened it.

275
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,931
It's addressed to you.

276
00:26:41,251 --> 00:26:42,377
Yep.

277
00:26:42,486 --> 00:26:46,980
"My dearest Tristan, please know that
I only ever wanted the best for you."

278
00:26:48,425 --> 00:26:52,452
<i>Had my mistress allowed it,
I would have kept you in a heartbeat.</i>

279
00:26:53,797 --> 00:26:56,664
<i>My dearest wish is that
we will meet someday.</i>

280
00:26:58,335 --> 00:27:01,202
<i>The fastest way to travel
is by candlelight.</i>

281
00:27:02,606 --> 00:27:05,507
<i>To use it, think of me and only me.</i>

282
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:10,377
<i>I will think of you every day, for always.</i>

283
00:27:13,016 --> 00:27:14,483
"Your mother."

284
00:27:21,658 --> 00:27:23,285
Well, do you... Do you have a light?

285
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:09,636
Mother?

286
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,971
Oh! Oh, Mother, I'm so... I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

287
00:28:13,076 --> 00:28:16,339
No, I'm not.
And I'm not your mother, so get off me!

288
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,539
You're... You're not my mother?

289
00:28:19,648 --> 00:28:21,946
Do I look like I'm your mother?

290
00:28:23,318 --> 00:28:24,342
No.

291
00:28:24,653 --> 00:28:25,813
Sorry.

292
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:29,818
Well, are you all right?
Do you want some help?

293
00:28:29,924 --> 00:28:32,290
You can help by leaving me alone!

294
00:28:33,561 --> 00:28:34,892
All right.

295
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:45,538
Oh, my God.
"Light the candle and think of me."

296
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,665
I was. I was thinking of my...

297
00:28:47,776 --> 00:28:50,506
But then Victoria and the star
just popped into...

298
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:56,474
Oh, excuse me, madam. Sorry.

299
00:28:56,584 --> 00:29:00,486
This may seem strange, but
have you seen a fallen star anywhere?

300
00:29:01,222 --> 00:29:03,087
- You're funny.
- No, really, we're in a crater.

301
00:29:03,191 --> 00:29:05,284
This must be where it fell.

302
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:07,354
Yeah, this is where it fell.

303
00:29:07,462 --> 00:29:10,431
It is. Or if you want to be really specific,

304
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:12,864
up there is where
this weird, bloody necklace

305
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:15,094
came out of nowhere
and knocked it out of the heavens

306
00:29:15,203 --> 00:29:17,034
when it was minding its own business.

307
00:29:17,138 --> 00:29:19,038
And over there is where it landed.

308
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:24,908
And right here, this is where it got hit
by a magical flying moron!

309
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:31,314
You're the star! You're the star? Really?

310
00:29:31,986 --> 00:29:36,582
Oh, wow. I'm sorry.
I had no idea you'd be a...

311
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,424
May I just say in advance
that I am sorry?

312
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:43,856
- Sorry for what?
- For this.

313
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:46,866
Now, if I am not mistaken,
this means you have to come with me.

314
00:29:46,968 --> 00:29:50,631
See, you're going to be a birthday gift
for Victoria, my true love.

315
00:29:50,739 --> 00:29:52,104
But of course!

316
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:56,200
Nothing says romance like the gift
of a kidnapped, injured woman!

317
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,842
I'm not going anywhere with you.

318
00:30:04,085 --> 00:30:06,986
Hurry. You should be
on your way now, Primus.

319
00:30:08,757 --> 00:30:12,249
You must find the royal necklace
with the ruby before your brothers.

320
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,763
I should like to see you take the throne.
The first benevolent king.

321
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:21,459
I don't doubt Stormhold would be
a better place under your rule.

322
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,797
Really?

323
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,395
Well, that is fascinating.

324
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:27,634
- Don't you think, Tertius?
- Yes, indeed.

325
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:32,543
Prince Septimus! Tertius. Well... Well.
Well, well, I...

326
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:37,145
Since you're all here,
won't you join me in a toast?

327
00:30:38,885 --> 00:30:40,512
What a very good idea.

328
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,020
To the new King of Stormhold,

329
00:30:43,122 --> 00:30:46,353
whichever of you fine fellows
it might be.

330
00:30:47,093 --> 00:30:49,288
To the new King of Stormhold.

331
00:31:30,636 --> 00:31:31,728
You!

332
00:31:56,195 --> 00:31:58,823
You really thought that you were king?

333
00:31:59,131 --> 00:32:01,531
- You killed the Bishop?
- No, Primus.

334
00:32:01,634 --> 00:32:06,469
I think you'll find that you killed the
Bishop by drinking out of the wrong cup.

335
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,474
Oh, look, when you finish wrestling
with your conscience,

336
00:32:09,575 --> 00:32:12,305
may I suggest you return
to your chamber?

337
00:32:12,411 --> 00:32:14,811
Leave the quest for the stone to me.

338
00:32:22,088 --> 00:32:24,886
How have we lived this way
all these years?

339
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:41,829
In my absence, I expect you to make it
fit for the queens we are.

340
00:32:42,508 --> 00:32:47,810
When I return with our prize,
all of us shall be young again.

341
00:32:49,548 --> 00:32:51,641
Never fear, my sisters.

342
00:32:53,152 --> 00:32:54,744
I will not fail.

343
00:33:05,195 --> 00:33:06,628
Don't you ever sleep?

344
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:07,697
Not at night.

345
00:33:08,165 --> 00:33:09,530
May have escaped your notice, genius,

346
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:11,658
but that's when stars
have rather better things to do.

347
00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:14,067
They're coming out, shining,
that sort of thing.

348
00:33:14,171 --> 00:33:17,402
Yeah, well, it may have escaped yours,
but you're not in the sky anymore.

349
00:33:17,508 --> 00:33:19,476
Coming out is off the agenda.

350
00:33:19,576 --> 00:33:23,273
Shining has been suspended
until further notice.

351
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,816
Oh, and sleeping during the day
is O-U-T.

352
00:33:27,551 --> 00:33:31,009
Unless you have some magical ability
to sleep while you're walking.

353
00:33:31,121 --> 00:33:33,487
Have you not got it
into your thick head yet?

354
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,581
I'm not walking anywhere!

355
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,486
Fine.

356
00:33:38,062 --> 00:33:41,088
Sit in a crater.
I've had enough of you anyway.

357
00:33:41,465 --> 00:33:44,059
I was gonna put you back in the sky
once I'd brought you to my Victoria,

358
00:33:44,168 --> 00:33:47,365
but clearly, you'd rather sit on your own
in the middle of nowhere forever.

359
00:33:47,471 --> 00:33:50,838
And just how were you planning
to get me back to the sky?

360
00:33:50,941 --> 00:33:54,206
I find the fastest way to travel
is by candlelight.

361
00:33:54,645 --> 00:33:58,513
- You've got a Babylon candle.
- Yeah, I have a bubbling candle.

362
00:33:58,615 --> 00:34:00,173
- A Babylon candle.
- That's what I said.

363
00:34:00,284 --> 00:34:01,273
You said "Bubbling."

364
00:34:01,385 --> 00:34:03,785
Anyway, I was going to give
what's left of it to you.

365
00:34:03,887 --> 00:34:06,219
Well, that barely has one use left.

366
00:34:06,323 --> 00:34:10,817
So be grateful I'm not using it right now
to get us both back to the wall.

367
00:34:10,928 --> 00:34:14,295
Unless you have a better way of
getting yourself home.

368
00:34:16,934 --> 00:34:18,060
Fine!

369
00:34:18,502 --> 00:34:20,163
Help me up.

370
00:34:20,838 --> 00:34:23,238
All right. All right. I'm helping.

371
00:34:24,608 --> 00:34:26,200
And you are gonna have to walk
quicker than that.

372
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,074
Otherwise, I'll never get you back
to Victoria in a week.

373
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:30,646
Don't push your luck.

374
00:34:32,516 --> 00:34:36,384
Don't take less than a florin for him,
Bernard! You understand?

375
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:38,614
- Yes, Mother.
- No dilly-dallying!

376
00:34:38,722 --> 00:34:42,624
And don't even think of stopping at the
tavern, Bernard, or you'll be sorry!

377
00:34:42,726 --> 00:34:44,853
A florin for your goat, boy.

378
00:34:50,234 --> 00:34:52,702
He's a bit small to pull your cart.

379
00:34:54,571 --> 00:34:56,266
You're quite right.

380
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:08,312
That's much better.

381
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,218
Bernard!

382
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,288
Bernard!

383
00:35:39,514 --> 00:35:40,708
Get on!

384
00:36:16,918 --> 00:36:18,215
Who goes there?

385
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,311
What do you want with me,
a poor old flower...

386
00:36:20,422 --> 00:36:23,357
Oh, do shut up. I know what you are

387
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:28,088
and I swear by the ordinances of the
sisterhood to which we both belong

388
00:36:28,196 --> 00:36:30,664
that I mean you no harm this day.

389
00:36:30,765 --> 00:36:32,756
I wish to share your meal.

390
00:36:33,201 --> 00:36:39,071
Well, one can never be too careful.
Sit down. I'll get you a seat.

391
00:36:48,016 --> 00:36:49,813
- Anything else?
- Nope.

392
00:36:53,421 --> 00:36:54,979
What's it to be?

393
00:36:55,624 --> 00:36:57,148
Heads or tails?

394
00:36:57,826 --> 00:36:58,986
Heads.

395
00:37:00,795 --> 00:37:02,524
So, stranger,

396
00:37:02,998 --> 00:37:05,990
where are you headed off to
on this fine day?

397
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:08,035
I seek a fallen star.

398
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:10,901
She fell not far from here.

399
00:37:11,006 --> 00:37:13,236
And when I find her,
I shall take my great knife

400
00:37:13,341 --> 00:37:15,809
and cut out her heart
while she still lives.

401
00:37:15,911 --> 00:37:20,371
And the glory of our youth
shall be restored.

402
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:22,348
Fallen star?

403
00:37:23,518 --> 00:37:26,043
That's the best news I've had in ages.

404
00:37:26,154 --> 00:37:28,918
I could do with losing
a few years meself.

405
00:37:29,024 --> 00:37:31,083
So whereabouts did you...

406
00:37:31,193 --> 00:37:32,717
Limbus grass!

407
00:37:32,827 --> 00:37:38,163
You dare to steal truth from my lips
by feeding me limbus grass?

408
00:37:38,266 --> 00:37:42,532
Do you have any idea what a big
mistake you've made, Ditchwater Sal?

409
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:45,731
How do you know my...

410
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,831
- Who are you?
- Look again.

411
00:37:50,378 --> 00:37:54,278
I shall not seek the star,
Your Dark Majesty. I swear.

412
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,041
Seek all you wish.

413
00:37:58,218 --> 00:38:01,676
You shall not see the star, touch it,
smell or hear it.

414
00:38:02,722 --> 00:38:06,249
You will not perceive her
even if she stands before you.

415
00:38:13,233 --> 00:38:16,202
Pray you never meet me again,
Ditchwater Sal.

416
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,895
Oh, right. So let me get this straight.

417
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,565
You think you know
we're going the right way because...

418
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,438
And I quote, "I just do."

419
00:38:24,544 --> 00:38:26,239
I do, though. I don't know why.

420
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:29,008
Maybe it's my love for Victoria
guiding me home.

421
00:38:29,115 --> 00:38:30,673
- Please.
- Yvonne, whether you like it or not...

422
00:38:30,783 --> 00:38:33,411
Yvaine! My name is Yvaine, so...

423
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,817
How many times do I have to...

424
00:38:35,922 --> 00:38:38,686
Would you...
Would you please slow down?

425
00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:40,053
Yes, yes.

426
00:38:41,995 --> 00:38:43,155
Look, we're...
We're going north, all right?

427
00:38:43,263 --> 00:38:44,525
The wall's north.

428
00:38:44,631 --> 00:38:47,794
And if you look up in the sky,
even during the day, you can see the...

429
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,595
The evening star. That's so weird.

430
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,567
That's funny. Hilarious.
My sides are splitting.

431
00:38:51,671 --> 00:38:53,263
No, I'm being...

432
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,637
Wait that... That was you! Really?

433
00:38:58,911 --> 00:39:00,674
What... What are...

434
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,112
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

435
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,377
- Sitting down. I'm tired.
- Please don't do this again.

436
00:39:05,485 --> 00:39:07,953
We agreed we'd stop off
at the next village to eat and rest.

437
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:11,023
Come on, Tristan. It's midday.

438
00:39:11,624 --> 00:39:15,958
I never stay up this late!
Just, please, let me sleep!

439
00:39:16,796 --> 00:39:21,290
Okay, you... Well, then I'll... You sleep.
I'll go and get something to eat.

440
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,268
What are you doing?

441
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:33,607
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm making sure you don't run away.

442
00:39:49,729 --> 00:39:54,132
Your Highness, the soothsayer,
as you requested.

443
00:39:55,568 --> 00:39:57,160
South, you said.

444
00:39:58,137 --> 00:39:59,627
South we went.

445
00:40:01,074 --> 00:40:02,598
Still no stone.

446
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,637
Do you now propose
we start swimming?

447
00:40:06,746 --> 00:40:11,809
Sire, I've merely relayed to you
what the runes have told me.

448
00:40:11,918 --> 00:40:13,510
I can do no more.

449
00:40:14,785 --> 00:40:16,753
Well, consult them again.

450
00:40:17,188 --> 00:40:18,280
Wait.

451
00:40:21,292 --> 00:40:25,285
Before we seek the stone,
I have another question.

452
00:40:27,231 --> 00:40:29,028
Am I the seventh son?

453
00:40:33,571 --> 00:40:34,663
Yes.

454
00:40:34,772 --> 00:40:36,399
Another question.

455
00:40:37,141 --> 00:40:39,769
Is my favorite color blue?

456
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:44,470
Yes.

457
00:40:44,582 --> 00:40:48,313
Has excessive begging or pleading
ever persuaded me

458
00:40:48,419 --> 00:40:50,683
to spare the life of a traitor?

459
00:40:53,991 --> 00:40:55,515
What does that mean?

460
00:40:55,626 --> 00:40:58,186
- That means no.
- Good.

461
00:40:59,163 --> 00:41:02,098
Throw them again.
This time, throw them high.

462
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:08,229
Do you work for my brother?

463
00:41:24,655 --> 00:41:27,681
So, do we continue west?

464
00:41:58,155 --> 00:41:59,349
Tristan?

465
00:42:08,365 --> 00:42:09,764
Who's there?

466
00:42:17,241 --> 00:42:19,004
Tristan, is that you?

467
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,600
It's not funny.

468
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,178
Tristan?

469
00:42:37,361 --> 00:42:38,587
Come on.

470
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:24,564
Be careful how much magic
you use, sister.

471
00:43:24,673 --> 00:43:26,470
It's beginning to show.

472
00:43:26,575 --> 00:43:29,908
One goat and a small enchantment.
Hardly extravagant.

473
00:43:30,012 --> 00:43:32,947
Well, even using the ring
will take its toll.

474
00:43:33,048 --> 00:43:35,380
Better you call on us only in dire need.

475
00:43:35,484 --> 00:43:38,783
And use your runes
to locate the star yourself.

476
00:43:38,887 --> 00:43:40,878
I used them and she should be here.

477
00:43:40,989 --> 00:43:43,787
But now
they're just telling me gibberish.

478
00:44:01,243 --> 00:44:04,041
It is because you must stay
where you are, my sister.

479
00:44:04,146 --> 00:44:05,374
She is coming to you.

480
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,108
Oh, be warned, Lamia.
Delicacy is needed.

481
00:44:08,216 --> 00:44:12,243
Misery has drained her.
She's barely shining.

482
00:44:12,354 --> 00:44:17,087
Set a trap that ensures her heart
is glowing before you cut it out.

483
00:44:17,926 --> 00:44:21,089
Yvaine! Yvaine!

484
00:44:21,964 --> 00:44:23,454
Oh, you idiot.

485
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,848
You shall become human.

486
00:46:04,898 --> 00:46:09,096
You are Billy, the innkeeper.
I am your wife, and you're our daughter.

487
00:46:09,202 --> 00:46:13,662
Now, make everything ready.
Our special guest will be here soon.

488
00:46:24,584 --> 00:46:28,680
I mean, who's to say he'd have even
kept his promise about the candle?

489
00:46:28,788 --> 00:46:32,451
I just refuse to believe
he's the only person in Stormhold

490
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:34,254
who could've helped me.

491
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:38,626
Going on and on and on.
Just "Victoria this" and "Victoria that."

492
00:46:41,034 --> 00:46:42,262
<i>Tristan?</i>

493
00:46:43,703 --> 00:46:46,297
<i>Please protect our sister, Tristan.</i>

494
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:50,173
<i>Yvaine is in grave danger.</i>

495
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:53,308
<i>The unicorn came to help her.</i>

496
00:46:54,047 --> 00:46:56,538
<i>But now they're heading into a trap.</i>

497
00:47:00,553 --> 00:47:03,351
<i>No star is safe in Stormhold.</i>

498
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:08,590
<i>The last to fall, 400 years ago,</i>

499
00:47:08,695 --> 00:47:14,031
<i>was captured by the same witches
who seek Yvaine now.</i>

500
00:47:15,235 --> 00:47:16,862
<i>They tricked her,</i>

501
00:47:18,404 --> 00:47:19,894
<i>cared for her,</i>

502
00:47:21,207 --> 00:47:24,836
<i>and when her heart
was once more aglow,</i>

503
00:47:25,445 --> 00:47:28,810
<i>they cut it from her chest</i>

504
00:47:29,881 --> 00:47:31,508
<i>and ate it.</i>

505
00:47:34,085 --> 00:47:36,053
<i>There's no time to waste.</i>

506
00:47:36,154 --> 00:47:37,883
<i>A coach is coming.</i>

507
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:41,618
<i>By any means possible,
you must get on it.</i>

508
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,318
<i>Run.</i>

509
00:48:23,835 --> 00:48:26,827
If Septimus insists on sending a boy
to do a man's job...

510
00:48:26,938 --> 00:48:27,927
No, no, no, wait, please!

511
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:29,904
I don't know a Septimus.
I just need a lift.

512
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:32,805
Look at me, look at me.
I'm unarmed. Please.

513
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:35,303
Please, let me ride with you.

514
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:38,780
I'm afraid that's impossible.
I'm on a quest of enormous importance.

515
00:48:38,883 --> 00:48:40,783
Well, then all the more reason
to take me with you.

516
00:48:40,885 --> 00:48:44,377
There may come a time when you need
a second pair of hands. Sir?

517
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:48,117
Please. Maybe providence sent me
to you just as it sent you to me.

518
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,256
- Get on.
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

519
00:49:17,355 --> 00:49:20,882
Goodness me, my dear.
Come in out of this wretched rain!

520
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:25,557
We have food and drink, a warm bed
and plenty of hot water for a bath.

521
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:48,813
How do you like your bath?
Warm, hot or boil-a-lobster?

522
00:49:49,754 --> 00:49:50,946
I honestly don't know.

523
00:49:51,053 --> 00:49:52,452
Then let me choose for you,

524
00:49:52,554 --> 00:49:55,751
and I'll have my husband
take your horse to the stable.

525
00:49:56,725 --> 00:49:57,851
Billy?

526
00:50:08,737 --> 00:50:12,002
Now, let's get you out
of your wet things, shall we?

527
00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:24,786
Feeling better?

528
00:50:24,887 --> 00:50:26,616
Much. Thank you.

529
00:50:27,022 --> 00:50:29,513
The warm water's actually done me
a world of good.

530
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:32,594
You see?
The powers of a nice, hot bath.

531
00:50:32,695 --> 00:50:35,129
And your leg? Any improvement?

532
00:50:37,032 --> 00:50:38,863
That is extraordinary.

533
00:50:39,368 --> 00:50:43,099
It's the very least I could do.
I'm just glad you're feeling better.

534
00:50:43,205 --> 00:50:45,070
You seem happier in yourself, too.

535
00:50:45,174 --> 00:50:48,473
I do feel happier. Less troubled.

536
00:50:49,712 --> 00:50:50,872
Wonderful.

537
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,875
Nothing like a nice soak
to warm the cockles of your heart.

538
00:51:02,858 --> 00:51:06,191
Now, I'm only a simple innkeeper's wife,

539
00:51:06,295 --> 00:51:09,787
but I've been told
I have a healer's hands.

540
00:51:10,933 --> 00:51:13,367
I'd be glad to give you a massage.

541
00:51:13,902 --> 00:51:15,392
What's a massage?

542
00:51:15,504 --> 00:51:18,735
Never had... Well, bless my soul.

543
00:51:19,475 --> 00:51:23,605
Nothing like a massage to send you off
for the finest and deepest night's sleep.

544
00:51:23,712 --> 00:51:25,179
I do have trouble sleeping at night.

545
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,145
Lie on your back, dear.

546
00:51:30,185 --> 00:51:32,153
Why not close your eyes?

547
00:51:33,222 --> 00:51:35,588
You'll drift off better that way.

548
00:51:49,972 --> 00:51:50,996
Hello!

549
00:51:53,108 --> 00:51:54,097
Service!

550
00:51:54,209 --> 00:51:56,734
Maybe we should carry on
and try the next inn,

551
00:51:56,845 --> 00:51:59,575
especially if this stone is as close
as your runes say.

552
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:01,410
I'll give it one more try.

553
00:52:05,954 --> 00:52:07,182
Relax here, my love.

554
00:52:07,289 --> 00:52:10,656
I'll be back just as soon as
I've taken care of this customer.

555
00:52:15,762 --> 00:52:18,196
At last. We require accommodation.

556
00:52:18,298 --> 00:52:21,631
Please help my friend
take the horses to the stables.

557
00:52:35,615 --> 00:52:36,741
Hello!

558
00:52:57,370 --> 00:52:58,860
I'm accustomed to better service,

559
00:52:58,972 --> 00:53:01,839
but you're awake now
and that's what counts.

560
00:53:02,709 --> 00:53:04,040
Prepare your best room.

561
00:53:04,144 --> 00:53:05,202
- She got the stone.
- Stone, stone.

562
00:53:05,312 --> 00:53:09,476
I'll thank you not to bother my guest, sir.
I am the lady of this inn.

563
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:11,107
Glass of wine?

564
00:53:11,218 --> 00:53:12,412
No, no, no, no, no.

565
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,309
No.

566
00:53:15,288 --> 00:53:19,315
Until my brother is dead,
I have vowed to drink only my own wine.

567
00:53:21,461 --> 00:53:24,953
Though my friend in the stables
might be glad of a drop.

568
00:53:27,267 --> 00:53:29,201
Your best room, perhaps?

569
00:53:30,804 --> 00:53:32,135
Of course.

570
00:53:39,346 --> 00:53:41,473
I'm sorry. I presumed that...

571
00:53:42,048 --> 00:53:44,016
Traveling alone, are you?

572
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:48,886
I've just stabled my four black stallions
and my carriage.

573
00:53:48,989 --> 00:53:52,117
Well, I say mine.
It belonged to my late father.

574
00:54:06,106 --> 00:54:07,334
Thank you.

575
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,740
That's so kind, thank you very much.
My name's Tristan. What's yours?

576
00:54:11,845 --> 00:54:13,073
Bernard.

577
00:54:20,887 --> 00:54:24,015
There was not a horse or beast
he could not master.

578
00:54:24,124 --> 00:54:26,854
So much so that in his youth,
he took to riding a camel,

579
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,325
which was comical.

580
00:54:28,428 --> 00:54:30,521
When he passed,
the carriage came to me.

581
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:31,654
She's got the stone!

582
00:54:31,765 --> 00:54:32,754
- She's got it!
- She's got it!

583
00:54:32,866 --> 00:54:36,131
And it's the largest in all of Stormhold,
so they say.

584
00:54:36,236 --> 00:54:38,998
How nice for you. If you'll excuse me.

585
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,195
Wait.

586
00:54:40,905 --> 00:54:42,896
That stone you're wearing. It can't be.

587
00:54:43,007 --> 00:54:44,599
- Oh, finally.
- Yeah, good, well done, yes, sir.

588
00:54:44,709 --> 00:54:45,676
- Well done.
- Sweet.

589
00:54:45,777 --> 00:54:46,766
Come here. Let me see it.

590
00:54:59,824 --> 00:55:01,815
You have no idea
what you're meddling with.

591
00:55:01,926 --> 00:55:07,728
I am Primus, the first born of Stormhold
and I demand that you bring it to me!

592
00:55:07,832 --> 00:55:09,322
Bring me the stone! Now!

593
00:55:09,434 --> 00:55:12,562
Prince Primus! Don't touch anything
they give you! They tried to...

594
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,850
- Are you all right?
- Billy!

595
00:55:33,024 --> 00:55:34,150
Get him!

596
00:56:12,764 --> 00:56:15,164
The burning golden heart
of a star at peace

597
00:56:15,266 --> 00:56:18,292
is so much better
than your frightened little heart.

598
00:56:18,403 --> 00:56:22,339
Even so, better than no heart at all.

599
00:56:24,342 --> 00:56:27,038
Yvaine?
Hold me tight and think of home.

600
00:56:35,219 --> 00:56:37,881
No!

601
00:56:56,341 --> 00:57:00,744
- What the hell did you do?
- What did I do? What did you do?

602
00:57:00,845 --> 00:57:03,744
"Think of home!" That was a great plan!

603
00:57:03,846 --> 00:57:05,905
You thought of your home
and I thought of mine

604
00:57:06,015 --> 00:57:07,880
and now we're halfway between the two!

605
00:57:07,983 --> 00:57:11,043
Oh, you stupid cow!
What did you think of your home for?

606
00:57:11,153 --> 00:57:12,586
You just said "home"!

607
00:57:12,688 --> 00:57:16,021
If you wanted me to think of your home,
you should have said!

608
00:57:16,125 --> 00:57:18,559
Some crazy lady
was going to cut your heart out

609
00:57:18,661 --> 00:57:20,390
and you wanted
more specific instructions?

610
00:57:20,496 --> 00:57:23,897
Perhaps you'd like it in writing!
Or a diagram, maybe!

611
00:57:32,274 --> 00:57:36,074
Look, Captain Shakespeare!
Caught ourselves a little bonus!

612
00:57:36,679 --> 00:57:38,977
A couple of Lightning Marshals!

613
00:57:42,852 --> 00:57:45,912
They don't look
like Lightning Marshals to me.

614
00:57:46,021 --> 00:57:49,115
Why else would anyone be up here
in the middle of a storm?

615
00:57:49,225 --> 00:57:52,422
"Why else would anyone be up here
in the middle of a storm?"

616
00:57:52,561 --> 00:57:54,290
Well, let's think.

617
00:57:54,397 --> 00:57:57,662
Maybe for the same godforsaken reason
we are!

618
00:57:58,401 --> 00:57:59,959
Now, who are you?

619
00:58:01,837 --> 00:58:05,068
Let's see if a night on our lovely brig
will loosen their lips!

620
00:58:05,174 --> 00:58:08,109
- Get them in the brig!
- You heard the man! Let's go!

621
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:12,977
Get them into the brig and the rest of
you dirty dogs, back to work!

622
00:58:13,082 --> 00:58:15,676
We've got lightning to catch! Come on!

623
00:58:39,675 --> 00:58:43,441
- They're going to kill us, aren't they?
- I don't know.

624
00:58:46,115 --> 00:58:48,982
You know, it's funny. I used to watch...

625
00:58:50,386 --> 00:58:53,116
I used to watch people
having adventures.

626
00:58:55,224 --> 00:58:56,714
I envied them.

627
00:58:58,227 --> 00:59:01,196
You ever heard the expression,
"Be careful what you wish for"?

628
00:59:01,297 --> 00:59:03,993
What? So ending up with my heart
cut out, that'll serve me right, will it?

629
00:59:04,099 --> 00:59:07,125
No. No, I didn't...
I didn't mean it like that.

630
00:59:09,138 --> 00:59:11,265
Look, I admire you dreaming.

631
00:59:12,675 --> 00:59:14,643
Shop boy like me,

632
00:59:14,743 --> 00:59:16,643
I could never have imagined
an adventure this big

633
00:59:16,745 --> 00:59:19,009
in order to have wished for it.

634
00:59:19,381 --> 00:59:22,316
I just thought
I'd find some lump of celestial rock

635
00:59:22,418 --> 00:59:25,012
and take it home, and that would be it.

636
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,449
And you got me.

637
00:59:34,761 --> 00:59:38,788
If there's one thing I've learned
in all my years watching Earth,

638
00:59:38,899 --> 00:59:41,697
it's that people aren't
what they may seem.

639
00:59:42,436 --> 00:59:43,460
There are shop boys

640
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:47,836
and there are boys who just happen
to work in shops for the time being.

641
00:59:47,941 --> 00:59:51,934
And trust me, Tristan,
you're no shop boy.

642
00:59:54,181 --> 00:59:56,843
You saved my life. Thank you.

643
01:00:01,822 --> 01:00:03,414
Well, well, well.

644
01:00:04,057 --> 01:00:05,888
The last brother dead.

645
01:00:07,628 --> 01:00:09,653
Which means that I'm king.

646
01:00:13,734 --> 01:00:14,962
I'm king!

647
01:00:17,938 --> 01:00:19,530
Not yet, brother.

648
01:00:20,807 --> 01:00:23,002
Damn. I still need the stone.

649
01:00:24,244 --> 01:00:28,010
- Your brother doesn't have it?
- Well, why don't you find out?

650
01:00:38,258 --> 01:00:39,885
Where is my stone?

651
01:00:39,993 --> 01:00:41,722
I don't...

652
01:00:41,828 --> 01:00:44,729
The man, see, your brother...
I heard him speak of a stone.

653
01:00:44,831 --> 01:00:47,732
Yeah. The girl had it. The girl had it.

654
01:00:47,834 --> 01:00:49,734
- What girl?
- I don't know.

655
01:00:49,836 --> 01:00:52,532
A girl. She got away.
Because this was a trap set up for her,

656
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:55,699
but your brother,
he come just straight into it.

657
01:00:55,809 --> 01:00:58,073
A trap? Set by who?

658
01:00:58,378 --> 01:01:00,278
A woman you should pray
you'll never meet.

659
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:01,574
She's...

660
01:01:02,549 --> 01:01:05,416
She's gone.
She took your brother's carriage.

661
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:07,612
This woman wanted my stone?

662
01:01:07,721 --> 01:01:10,121
No. She wanted the girl's heart.

663
01:01:10,223 --> 01:01:14,523
She said the girl was a star and
she wanted to cut out her heart and...

664
01:01:17,164 --> 01:01:18,358
Eat it?

665
01:01:20,133 --> 01:01:21,498
Oh, my God.

666
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:25,630
Do you have any idea what this means?

667
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:28,567
Everlasting life.

668
01:01:29,943 --> 01:01:31,934
King forever.

669
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:37,641
It's not here, sire.

670
01:01:37,751 --> 01:01:39,844
This idiot's coming with us.

671
01:02:04,275 --> 01:02:06,334
- Ask again.
- We have asked again

672
01:02:06,444 --> 01:02:08,742
and the answer is still the same.
She is airborne!

673
01:02:08,847 --> 01:02:10,144
Well, she can't remain so forever.

674
01:02:10,248 --> 01:02:12,216
Inform me
as soon as she touches ground!

675
01:02:12,317 --> 01:02:14,217
Lmmediately! Do you understand?

676
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:17,880
Watch your tongue, sister!
It is you and not we who've lost her.

677
01:02:17,989 --> 01:02:19,854
Lost her and broken the knife!

678
01:02:19,958 --> 01:02:22,927
Even if you apprehend her,
how will you complete the deed?

679
01:02:23,028 --> 01:02:26,395
Perhaps you should return now
and one of us set out in your place.

680
01:02:26,498 --> 01:02:27,692
Don't be absurd.

681
01:02:27,799 --> 01:02:30,666
I'll bring her home
and deal with her there.

682
01:02:30,769 --> 01:02:33,636
Be sure everything is ready
for our arrival.

683
01:02:40,478 --> 01:02:42,605
Tell me about Victoria then.

684
01:02:46,251 --> 01:02:47,878
Well, she...

685
01:02:51,456 --> 01:02:54,050
There's nothing more to tell you.

686
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:59,688
Because the little I know about love
is that it's unconditional.

687
01:03:00,432 --> 01:03:02,832
It's not something you can buy.

688
01:03:02,934 --> 01:03:05,801
Hang on.
This wasn't about me buying her love.

689
01:03:07,902 --> 01:03:10,666
This was a way for me
to prove how I felt.

690
01:03:13,441 --> 01:03:16,410
And what's she doing to prove
how she feels about you?

691
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:17,670
Well...

692
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:25,883
Look, Yvaine, you'll understand
when you meet her. All right?

693
01:03:26,387 --> 01:03:29,447
Provided we don't get murdered
by pirates first.

694
01:03:30,491 --> 01:03:35,588
Murdered by pirates.
Heart torn out and eaten. Meet Victoria.

695
01:03:35,696 --> 01:03:38,494
I can't quite decide
which sounds more fun.

696
01:03:41,035 --> 01:03:43,265
We've located the sky vessel.

697
01:03:43,371 --> 01:03:45,965
It's headed north
for the port town on Mount Drummond

698
01:03:46,073 --> 01:03:49,406
and you are no longer
the only one seeking the star.

699
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:51,478
There's someone following your tracks!

700
01:03:51,579 --> 01:03:53,672
A witch? A warlock?

701
01:03:53,781 --> 01:03:56,909
A prince and he's catching you up!
Get a move on!

702
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:30,713
So, this is the part where you tell me
who you are and why you're up here.

703
01:04:31,517 --> 01:04:36,750
Or I'll snap her pretty little fingers
one by one like dry twigs!

704
01:04:39,058 --> 01:04:41,083
My name is Tristan Thorn.

705
01:04:41,393 --> 01:04:43,918
- This is my wife, Yvaine.
- Your wife?

706
01:04:44,596 --> 01:04:48,293
Far too young and radiant
to belong to just one man!

707
01:04:48,667 --> 01:04:52,535
It's share and share alike
aboard my vessel, sonny boy!

708
01:04:54,073 --> 01:04:55,062
If you dare even touch her...

709
01:04:55,174 --> 01:04:57,870
You may think you're showing
a little spirit in front of your lady friend,

710
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:00,810
but if you talk back to me again,
I'll feed your tongue to the dogs,

711
01:05:00,913 --> 01:05:02,972
you impertinent little pup!

712
01:05:03,882 --> 01:05:06,749
- Sir?
- Better! But still interrupting.

713
01:05:06,852 --> 01:05:10,686
Let's see.
A hanging's always good for morale!

714
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:13,280
Maybe we'll watch you dance
a gallows jig!

715
01:05:15,361 --> 01:05:19,320
Or perhaps I'll just tip you over the side
and have done with it!

716
01:05:20,065 --> 01:05:21,965
It's a very long way down.

717
01:05:22,067 --> 01:05:25,468
Plenty of time to reminisce
about your pitifully short lives.

718
01:05:25,571 --> 01:05:28,506
Please, look, we're just trying
to make our way home,

719
01:05:28,607 --> 01:05:29,938
back to a place called Wall,
where I come from.

720
01:05:30,042 --> 01:05:31,566
What did you say?

721
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:33,770
I said we were trying to get home
to Wall.

722
01:05:33,879 --> 01:05:35,779
That's one lie too many, my son.

723
01:05:35,881 --> 01:05:36,848
- Wall?
- Shut up.

724
01:05:36,949 --> 01:05:37,916
What's he saying?

725
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:40,918
Thought you could just wander
onto my patch, did you?

726
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,453
- He is. Yeah, he's gonna...
- And live to tell the tale?

727
01:05:42,554 --> 01:05:45,045
All right, go, on the deck, on the deck,
on the deck! Now, go, go, go!

728
01:05:45,157 --> 01:05:49,594
Big mistake, Mr. Thorn!
And the last one you'll ever make!

729
01:05:56,869 --> 01:05:59,736
- No! No! You brute!
- Come... Come on!

730
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:02,966
- You murderer! You pig!
- Come on! Get up! Get up!

731
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:06,674
I'm taking the girl to my cabin,
and mark my words,

732
01:06:06,779 --> 01:06:08,508
anyone who disturbs me
for the next few hours

733
01:06:08,614 --> 01:06:10,479
- will get the same treatment!
- What? You'll...

734
01:06:10,582 --> 01:06:13,210
No, you idiot!
I'll sling you over the side as well!

735
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:14,580
Oh, yeah.

736
01:06:18,924 --> 01:06:21,290
Captain's busy. So should you be.

737
01:06:22,928 --> 01:06:24,691
Get in there, wench!

738
01:06:30,769 --> 01:06:33,397
So, that went well, I thought.

739
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:38,503
Now, tell me news
of my beloved England.

740
01:06:38,608 --> 01:06:41,202
I want to hear absolutely everything.

741
01:06:42,512 --> 01:06:45,504
Hang on.
I can't believe your crew fell for that.

742
01:06:45,615 --> 01:06:48,049
And where in God's name
did you get that mannequin from?

743
01:06:48,151 --> 01:06:49,846
Oh, it works every time.

744
01:06:49,953 --> 01:06:52,183
An ounce of bargaining,
a pinch of trickery,

745
01:06:52,289 --> 01:06:54,814
<i>a soupon of intimidation, et voil!</i>

746
01:06:54,925 --> 01:06:57,018
The perfect recipe
for a towering reputation

747
01:06:57,127 --> 01:06:59,595
without ever having to spill
one drop of blood.

748
01:06:59,696 --> 01:07:03,097
Ever try to get blood stains out
of a silk shirt? Nightmare.

749
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:06,658
Right. I still don't understand
how they won't recognize me.

750
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:07,759
Tristan, dear boy, when I'm done,

751
01:07:07,871 --> 01:07:08,838
your own mother won't recognize you.

752
01:07:08,939 --> 01:07:09,928
Now, we've no time to waste.

753
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,905
We have only two hours
before we make port.

754
01:07:12,008 --> 01:07:13,703
First and foremost...

755
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:20,975
It'll be so good to see you
out of those dreary clothes.

756
01:07:21,084 --> 01:07:24,349
So very small-town errand-boy.
Howlingly parochial.

757
01:07:26,089 --> 01:07:28,284
<i>Here. Trs you.</i>

758
01:07:28,925 --> 01:07:31,587
I wore it as a younger man.
I hate to throw anything away.

759
01:07:31,695 --> 01:07:33,287
You know the day you do,
it'll come back in fashion,

760
01:07:33,396 --> 01:07:35,296
<i>be oh, so de la mode.</i>

761
01:07:35,398 --> 01:07:36,797
Now, you, darling.

762
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,595
I have some lovely dresses.
Take your pick.

763
01:07:38,702 --> 01:07:40,169
Oh, no, really, I'm fine.

764
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:42,636
Honey, you're wearing a bathrobe.

765
01:07:44,608 --> 01:07:48,271
Now, England, England.
I want to hear everything.

766
01:07:49,012 --> 01:07:51,207
- You're not from England.
- Oh, no, sadly, no.

767
01:07:51,314 --> 01:07:53,612
But from my earliest youth,
I lapped up the stories.

768
01:07:53,717 --> 01:07:55,446
People always told me they were
nothing more than folklore,

769
01:07:55,552 --> 01:07:58,043
but my heart told me they were true.

770
01:07:58,155 --> 01:08:00,350
As a boy, I'd scurry away
from my father at the market

771
01:08:00,457 --> 01:08:03,324
while he did his deals
just to peek over the wall,

772
01:08:03,426 --> 01:08:06,418
dream of, perhaps, crossing it one day,
seeing England for myself.

773
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:08,930
Really? So you...
You were here looking over there.

774
01:08:09,032 --> 01:08:10,260
Oh, yes.

775
01:08:11,801 --> 01:08:14,167
- Hair.
- Hair?

776
01:08:15,372 --> 01:08:17,670
Mind you, I did my best to fit in.

777
01:08:17,774 --> 01:08:20,038
Tried to make my father,
Captain Ghostmaker, proud.

778
01:08:20,143 --> 01:08:22,543
Forged a decent reputation
as a ruthless marauder

779
01:08:22,646 --> 01:08:24,614
and cold-blooded killer.

780
01:08:25,015 --> 01:08:26,744
But my father died.

781
01:08:27,551 --> 01:08:29,746
I always promised him
I'd take over the family business,

782
01:08:29,853 --> 01:08:31,821
keep the old girl flying.

783
01:08:32,856 --> 01:08:34,756
You have no idea the lightness
it brings to my heart

784
01:08:34,858 --> 01:08:37,884
being able to confide in you
charming young people.

785
01:08:37,994 --> 01:08:40,326
The pressure of maintaining the
whole Captain Shakespeare persona

786
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:42,421
for the sake of the crew, I don't know.

787
01:08:42,532 --> 01:08:44,056
Sometimes...

788
01:08:44,167 --> 01:08:47,136
You see, I'm very much
a man of my own creation.

789
01:08:47,237 --> 01:08:50,104
Even chose the name specially.
Took me ages.

790
01:08:50,207 --> 01:08:52,300
See, I'm thinking
legendary British wordsmith.

791
01:08:52,409 --> 01:08:55,435
My enemies and crew are thinking,
"Shake! Spear!"

792
01:08:56,079 --> 01:08:58,240
It's little things like that make me happy.

793
01:08:58,582 --> 01:09:00,641
I don't understand that.

794
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:03,546
Surely it would make you happier
just to be yourself.

795
01:09:03,651 --> 01:09:06,950
Why fight to be accepted by people
you don't actually want to be like?

796
01:09:07,055 --> 01:09:10,081
Yeah.
Why would anyone do that to himself?

797
01:09:11,392 --> 01:09:12,620
Exactly.

798
01:09:15,730 --> 01:09:19,564
Port ahoy! Ready the lightning barrels!

799
01:09:33,348 --> 01:09:34,610
Hurry up.

800
01:09:43,658 --> 01:09:46,559
Yeah. Doesn't seem very fresh.
I'll be honest.

801
01:09:46,661 --> 01:09:48,686
Shall I give you a little taste,
young Ferdinand?

802
01:09:48,796 --> 01:09:50,559
No, no. Oh, there you go.

803
01:09:53,167 --> 01:09:54,896
Brilliant. Like they're cheap.

804
01:09:55,003 --> 01:09:58,939
<i>I think it's still crackling,
very much alive, still trs fresh.</i>

805
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:01,834
- So, name your best price.
- For 10,000 bolts?

806
01:10:01,943 --> 01:10:04,377
Ten thousand bolts
of finest quality grade A.

807
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:07,346
Yeah, but it's difficult to shift,
isn't it? Difficult to store.

808
01:10:07,448 --> 01:10:10,679
If I get the Revenue Men in here
sniffing round, what's the...

809
01:10:10,785 --> 01:10:12,548
Best price, 150 guineas.

810
01:10:12,654 --> 01:10:13,121
Gentlemen, put the merchandise
back onboard and prepare to sail.

811
01:10:13,121 --> 01:10:14,986
Gentlemen, put the merchandise
back onboard and prepare to sail.

812
01:10:15,089 --> 01:10:16,386
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Ferdinand, always a pleasure.

813
01:10:16,524 --> 01:10:18,253
Hold on. Hold on. One minute.
Hold on, cuddles.

814
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:20,224
- Oh, he's...
- One-sixty. One-sixty.

815
01:10:20,328 --> 01:10:22,262
Seeing as I'm feeling
particularly generous today,

816
01:10:22,363 --> 01:10:23,625
I'll settle for 200.

817
01:10:23,731 --> 01:10:26,757
Two hundred? Okay.
You're having a laugh.

818
01:10:26,868 --> 01:10:28,130
Have you had your head in that?

819
01:10:28,236 --> 01:10:31,296
Has he been sailing up
where the air's too thin?

820
01:10:32,807 --> 01:10:35,401
- You're being very rude.
- Not anymore.

821
01:10:36,577 --> 01:10:38,340
- Two hundred.
- One-eighty.

822
01:10:38,446 --> 01:10:39,879
- Two hundred.
- That's not negotiation.

823
01:10:39,981 --> 01:10:42,279
I'm changing my number.
One-eight-five.

824
01:10:42,383 --> 01:10:44,817
- Did I hear 200?
- From you, you did. Yeah.

825
01:10:44,919 --> 01:10:47,717
- You said 200.
- If I did, you're a ventriloquist.

826
01:10:47,822 --> 01:10:49,881
Okay, one-nine-five. Final offer.

827
01:10:50,258 --> 01:10:54,319
One-nine-five it is.
So, with sales tax, that's, let's see, 200.

828
01:10:54,429 --> 01:10:56,624
Brilliant. Put it in the back.

829
01:10:57,031 --> 01:10:59,192
Unbelievable. Here.

830
01:11:04,672 --> 01:11:06,401
Yes? Can I help you?

831
01:11:08,443 --> 01:11:09,535
Nosy.

832
01:11:10,011 --> 01:11:13,242
Have you heard any of these rumors
going round about a fallen star?

833
01:11:13,348 --> 01:11:14,747
Everyone's talking about it.

834
01:11:14,849 --> 01:11:18,148
You get your hands on one of them,
we can shut up shop. Retire.

835
01:11:18,252 --> 01:11:19,947
- Fallen star?
- Yeah.

836
01:11:25,991 --> 01:11:27,686
- Nothing on your travels?
- No.

837
01:11:27,793 --> 01:11:29,021
Not even a little sniff of a whisper?

838
01:11:29,128 --> 01:11:30,823
Everyone's going on about it
down at the market.

839
01:11:30,930 --> 01:11:32,192
Which market?
The market near the wall?

840
01:11:32,298 --> 01:11:33,265
Yeah.

841
01:11:33,366 --> 01:11:35,129
Well, Ferdy, you're wasting your time
listening to gossip

842
01:11:35,234 --> 01:11:37,168
from the kind of pond scum
trading down there.

843
01:11:37,269 --> 01:11:39,601
- Well, if it...
- Oh, my word! Speak of the devil.

844
01:11:39,705 --> 01:11:41,434
Oh, yeah? What were you saying, then?

845
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:43,838
Oh, what a wonderful woman
you are, Sal.

846
01:11:43,943 --> 01:11:45,638
How the world wouldn't be
the same place without you.

847
01:11:45,745 --> 01:11:47,406
You look great.
You've had your feet done, haven't you?

848
01:11:47,513 --> 01:11:51,609
But, you two, you have business
to attend to. Sal. Ferdy. Good day.

849
01:11:51,717 --> 01:11:54,413
Come on.
I've got something new for you.

850
01:12:01,093 --> 01:12:02,822
Captain Shakespeare.

851
01:12:03,229 --> 01:12:04,526
Stand down!

852
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:06,325
Meet my nephew,
the fearsome buccaneer,

853
01:12:06,432 --> 01:12:07,922
Tristan Thorn.

854
01:12:08,267 --> 01:12:10,792
He'll be joining us for our journey home.

855
01:12:10,903 --> 01:12:14,304
I have the perfect gift
to keep you amused on the way.

856
01:12:28,521 --> 01:12:29,988
Right, you lazy dogs!

857
01:12:30,089 --> 01:12:32,751
Let's get young Tristan
on his way home!

858
01:14:24,968 --> 01:14:26,162
Touch.

859
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:28,327
I'm impressed.

860
01:14:44,288 --> 01:14:46,381
Yvaine, I know what you are.

861
01:14:48,725 --> 01:14:51,717
No, no. Have no fear.

862
01:14:52,229 --> 01:14:56,393
No one on this vessel will harm you,
but there are plenty who would.

863
01:14:59,803 --> 01:15:03,534
Your emotions give you away, Yvaine.
You must learn to control them.

864
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,938
You've been glowing
more brightly every day,

865
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:07,476
and I think you know why.

866
01:15:07,578 --> 01:15:10,342
Of course I know why I'm glowing.
I'm a star.

867
01:15:10,514 --> 01:15:14,473
- And what do stars do best?
- Well, it's certainly not the waltz.

868
01:15:25,662 --> 01:15:26,924
- Now try.
- Okay.

869
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,129
- See?
- Very good.

870
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:48,816
Due west, you say?

871
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:50,250
And you're certain
he had a girl with him?

872
01:15:50,354 --> 01:15:51,343
Yeah.

873
01:15:51,455 --> 01:15:54,754
You're sure? Absolutely sure?
Sure you're not lying?

874
01:15:55,258 --> 01:15:57,556
I'd cross my heart if I had one.

875
01:15:58,895 --> 01:16:00,522
- Brilliant.
- You'd better be telling the truth,

876
01:16:00,631 --> 01:16:01,893
you two-faced dog.

877
01:16:01,999 --> 01:16:04,968
I can get you one of them, actually.
Very good guard dogs.

878
01:16:05,068 --> 01:16:07,229
They can watch the back
and the front door at the same time.

879
01:16:07,337 --> 01:16:08,304
I can get you anything you want.

880
01:16:08,405 --> 01:16:11,067
What are the chances of getting
a Babylon candle?

881
01:16:11,174 --> 01:16:12,607
That one's slim.

882
01:16:12,709 --> 01:16:17,167
Although, I did know a girl once,
if you know what I mean...

883
01:16:17,278 --> 01:16:18,370
I'm a ladies' man.

884
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,879
...who had a sister...

885
01:16:19,981 --> 01:16:21,039
I think it was a woman.

886
01:16:21,149 --> 01:16:24,880
Oh, she was terrible.
Face like a bag of frogs. Ugly frogs.

887
01:16:24,986 --> 01:16:26,180
Enough.

888
01:16:43,471 --> 01:16:46,201
Hold on tight!
The Captain's at the helm!

889
01:17:38,727 --> 01:17:41,457
So there's the road you'll need for Wall.

890
01:17:41,563 --> 01:17:45,055
Good luck on your journey home,
Yvaine, wherever that may be.

891
01:17:45,166 --> 01:17:48,135
And good luck to you, Tristan,
with your Victoria.

892
01:17:48,903 --> 01:17:50,734
Oh, how can we ever thank you enough
for your kindness?

893
01:17:50,839 --> 01:17:54,434
Don't mention it.
No, seriously, don't mention it.

894
01:17:54,542 --> 01:17:58,569
Reputations, you know.
A lifetime to build, seconds to destroy.

895
01:18:00,982 --> 01:18:03,917
Oh, and Tristan, just remember...

896
01:18:07,088 --> 01:18:08,851
Just think about it.

897
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:17,029
Well, give my regards to England.
It's been a pleasure to meet you both.

898
01:18:20,502 --> 01:18:23,767
Mind you don't wear that wench out,
Captain Tristan!

899
01:18:28,476 --> 01:18:30,376
What did he say to you?

900
01:18:31,312 --> 01:18:32,540
What did he say when?

901
01:18:32,647 --> 01:18:35,138
Just then. When he whispered to you.

902
01:18:36,651 --> 01:18:39,049
No... No, he... He was just saying
we should use the lightning

903
01:18:39,152 --> 01:18:41,382
to get you a Babylon candle.

904
01:18:41,487 --> 01:18:43,421
Barter for it, you know.

905
01:18:44,624 --> 01:18:48,185
For the last time, where is the girl?

906
01:18:49,562 --> 01:18:52,326
The girl with the stone!
Where did she go?

907
01:18:53,432 --> 01:18:55,559
- Are you mocking me?
- No...

908
01:18:55,668 --> 01:18:59,160
'Cause if you are, believe me,
you have seconds to live!

909
01:19:04,143 --> 01:19:05,576
What a freak.

910
01:19:05,912 --> 01:19:08,437
Clean this thoroughly.

911
01:19:16,656 --> 01:19:17,953
Bollocks.

912
01:19:20,226 --> 01:19:22,922
If you have quite finished
squandering your magic

913
01:19:23,029 --> 01:19:25,520
on your rather
counterproductive beauty routine,

914
01:19:25,631 --> 01:19:27,895
you might like to know that
the star has returned.

915
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,365
She's back on land.

916
01:19:29,468 --> 01:19:32,835
I know, damn it.
I couldn't reach the lake in time.

917
01:19:32,939 --> 01:19:37,308
No matter. We have found her.
She is on the road to the village of Wall.

918
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:39,935
If you take the shortcut
across the marshes,

919
01:19:40,046 --> 01:19:41,911
you should arrive in time
to intercept her.

920
01:19:50,890 --> 01:19:52,118
Yvaine.

921
01:19:55,962 --> 01:19:58,055
- Are you trying to break my leg again?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

922
01:19:58,164 --> 01:20:01,099
I just... I can't risk people seeing you.
I don't trust anyone.

923
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,861
But at this rate, if we keep stopping...

924
01:20:02,969 --> 01:20:07,929
Yvaine. We're making good time.
Just leave it a minute.

925
01:20:14,914 --> 01:20:16,643
Aren't you tempted?

926
01:20:19,752 --> 01:20:21,481
Tempted? By what?

927
01:20:23,289 --> 01:20:24,688
Lmmortality.

928
01:20:25,725 --> 01:20:27,590
Let's say it wasn't my heart.

929
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:31,459
Not me. Just a star you didn't know.

930
01:20:33,165 --> 01:20:35,861
You seriously think I could kill anyone?

931
01:20:39,972 --> 01:20:44,341
I mean, even if I could...
Everlasting life?

932
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:49,039
I imagine it would be kind of lonely.

933
01:20:51,284 --> 01:20:52,376
Well,

934
01:20:54,186 --> 01:20:56,950
maybe if you had someone
to share it with.

935
01:20:58,124 --> 01:20:59,716
Someone you love.

936
01:21:00,126 --> 01:21:02,524
Maybe then it might be different.

937
01:21:05,729 --> 01:21:07,856
Come on, I think we're safe.

938
01:21:29,987 --> 01:21:33,684
Now remember, Captain Shakespeare
has a fearsome reputation.

939
01:23:01,945 --> 01:23:04,539
- What the hell is this?
- What are you doing here?

940
01:23:04,648 --> 01:23:06,741
My name is Prince Septimus.

941
01:23:07,985 --> 01:23:10,749
And you're going to tell me
where I can find the girl.

942
01:23:18,062 --> 01:23:23,466
All right, twinkletoes.
I'm gonna count to three. One, two...

943
01:23:39,815 --> 01:23:44,479
You know, you sort of glitter sometimes.
I just noticed it. Is it normal?

944
01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:47,680
Let's see if you can work it out
for yourself.

945
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:49,586
What do stars do?

946
01:23:51,159 --> 01:23:52,786
Attract trouble?

947
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:57,194
That's... All right, I'm sorry.
Wait, I'm sorry.

948
01:23:57,299 --> 01:23:58,857
All right, let me... Let me...
Do I get another guess?

949
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:04,062
Is it... Do they know exactly how
to annoy a boy called Tristan Thorn?

950
01:24:08,343 --> 01:24:11,608
- How long will that take?
- Maybe two days.

951
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:15,444
But we don't have two days.
Victoria's birthday is tomorrow.

952
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:19,312
Yes, it is. Well remembered.

953
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:28,489
- Nice cup of Earl Grey.
- Get out, everybody. Get out.

954
01:24:28,597 --> 01:24:30,565
Did he hurt you, Captain?

955
01:24:32,267 --> 01:24:35,600
Did you tell him
where your nephew and the girl went?

956
01:24:36,671 --> 01:24:38,502
So what's the problem?

957
01:24:39,774 --> 01:24:41,469
It's my reputation.

958
01:24:42,978 --> 01:24:45,242
No. No, no. Don't be silly. Nonsense.

959
01:24:45,347 --> 01:24:47,178
It's all right, Captain.

960
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:50,384
We always knew you were a whoopsie.

961
01:24:53,688 --> 01:24:57,385
- You'll always be our captain, Captain.
- Aye, aye, Captain.

962
01:25:02,864 --> 01:25:03,831
Captain.

963
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:05,923
Yeah. Let's go, let's go.

964
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:14,973
Prince Septimus,
your men, they're dead.

965
01:25:15,076 --> 01:25:16,441
Oh, really?

966
01:25:18,346 --> 01:25:19,506
Go on!

967
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:35,494
I met that woman.
She's friends with the Captain.

968
01:25:35,597 --> 01:25:37,292
He said she trades at the market
near Wall.

969
01:25:37,399 --> 01:25:39,390
- We could hitch a lift.
- Really? She's a friend of the Captain's?

970
01:25:39,501 --> 01:25:40,729
- You sure?
- Yes, yes.

971
01:25:41,603 --> 01:25:45,369
Wait! Sorry!
My name is Tristan Thorn. This...

972
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:47,100
That's my flower.

973
01:25:47,842 --> 01:25:50,900
Eighteen years
I've been looking for that.

974
01:25:51,010 --> 01:25:52,637
Give it to me now!

975
01:25:53,379 --> 01:25:56,439
How dare you?
That was a gift from his mother!

976
01:25:58,084 --> 01:25:59,949
Perhaps I was mistaken.

977
01:26:01,254 --> 01:26:02,778
It's all right.

978
01:26:03,323 --> 01:26:05,416
It's obviously very valuable to you,
so you can have it

979
01:26:05,525 --> 01:26:07,049
in exchange for what I need.

980
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:09,219
- A Babylon candle?
- And safe passage to the wall.

981
01:26:09,329 --> 01:26:11,160
A Babylon candle?

982
01:26:11,264 --> 01:26:15,200
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't deal in black magic.

983
01:26:15,301 --> 01:26:16,495
Really?

984
01:26:17,136 --> 01:26:19,604
Well, can you give us a lift then?
To the wall?

985
01:26:19,706 --> 01:26:22,732
Well, why didn't you say so
in the first place?

986
01:26:24,777 --> 01:26:27,541
For that flower, I can offer you passage.

987
01:26:27,814 --> 01:26:29,975
- Food and lodging on the way?
- Safe passage.

988
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:32,415
I swear that you will arrive at the wall

989
01:26:32,518 --> 01:26:35,578
in the exact same condition
that you're in now.

990
01:26:41,194 --> 01:26:43,788
Do you have any idea what
manner of thing it was that you had?

991
01:26:43,896 --> 01:26:45,887
Some kind of lucky charm?

992
01:26:46,366 --> 01:26:49,597
A very lucky charm indeed. Protection.

993
01:26:50,436 --> 01:26:55,203
In fact, the exact same thing that
would've prevented me from doing this.

994
01:26:59,612 --> 01:27:02,308
- Oh, my God! What did you do?
- Much better.

995
01:27:02,415 --> 01:27:06,215
<i>You shall not see the star, touch it,
smell or hear it.</i>

996
01:27:06,586 --> 01:27:10,113
Though I'll keep me word.
You shall not be harmed.

997
01:27:19,065 --> 01:27:22,660
There.
Food and lodging just as I promised.

998
01:27:22,769 --> 01:27:26,899
Would I be correct in thinking that
you can neither see nor hear me?

999
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:30,036
Then I'd like to tell you
that you smell of pee.

1000
01:27:30,143 --> 01:27:31,906
You look like the wrong end of a dog.

1001
01:27:32,011 --> 01:27:34,479
And I swear,
if I don't get my Tristan back as he was,

1002
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:36,741
I'll be your personal poltergeist!

1003
01:27:55,968 --> 01:27:57,162
Tristan?

1004
01:27:58,738 --> 01:28:01,536
If you can understand me,
look at me now.

1005
01:28:30,067 --> 01:28:33,059
You know when I said
I knew little about love?

1006
01:28:34,805 --> 01:28:36,705
Well, that wasn't true.

1007
01:28:39,243 --> 01:28:41,177
I know a lot about love.

1008
01:28:41,946 --> 01:28:45,382
I've seen it.
I've seen centuries and centuries of it.

1009
01:28:47,184 --> 01:28:51,143
And it was the only thing that made
watching your world bearable.

1010
01:28:52,356 --> 01:28:57,817
All those wars. Pain and lies. Hate.

1011
01:28:59,964 --> 01:29:03,263
Made me want to turn away
and never look down again.

1012
01:29:05,403 --> 01:29:09,203
But to see the way that mankind loves.

1013
01:29:10,408 --> 01:29:13,138
I mean, you could search
the furthest reaches of the universe

1014
01:29:13,244 --> 01:29:16,077
and never find anything more beautiful.

1015
01:29:18,983 --> 01:29:24,387
So, yes, I know that
love is unconditional.

1016
01:29:26,023 --> 01:29:29,823
But I also know it can be unpredictable,

1017
01:29:30,795 --> 01:29:36,427
unexpected, uncontrollable, unbearable

1018
01:29:38,402 --> 01:29:42,498
and, well,
strangely easy to mistake for loathing.

1019
01:29:43,274 --> 01:29:44,241
And

1020
01:29:46,610 --> 01:29:51,013
what I'm trying to say, Tristan, is

1021
01:29:52,683 --> 01:29:54,412
I think I love you.

1022
01:29:55,519 --> 01:30:01,219
My heart, it feels like
my chest can barely contain it.

1023
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:08,498
Like it doesn't belong to me anymore.
It belongs to you.

1024
01:30:10,034 --> 01:30:14,266
And if you wanted it,
I'd wish for nothing in exchange.

1025
01:30:15,573 --> 01:30:20,533
No gifts, no goods,
no demonstrations of devotion.

1026
01:30:23,581 --> 01:30:26,175
Nothing but knowing you love me, too.

1027
01:30:28,118 --> 01:30:29,642
Just your heart

1028
01:30:31,722 --> 01:30:33,417
in exchange for mine.

1029
01:30:42,898 --> 01:30:45,093
The wall is one mile that way.

1030
01:30:45,901 --> 01:30:49,598
There. Though the walk might take
you a little longer than normal.

1031
01:30:49,705 --> 01:30:53,801
Transformation tends to leave the brain
a bit scrambled for a while.

1032
01:30:57,279 --> 01:30:58,610
You...

1033
01:31:01,083 --> 01:31:03,449
I warned you. Save your strength.

1034
01:31:04,419 --> 01:31:06,683
I've been so worried about you.

1035
01:31:07,356 --> 01:31:08,584
Victoria.

1036
01:31:09,625 --> 01:31:11,684
I think I preferred "Mother."

1037
01:31:13,595 --> 01:31:18,157
Come on. There's an inn over there.
Victoria's birthday's not till tomorrow.

1038
01:31:19,201 --> 01:31:20,668
I think you need a bath
and a good night's sleep

1039
01:31:20,769 --> 01:31:23,033
before you present me to her.

1040
01:31:23,138 --> 01:31:24,765
Come on. Come.

1041
01:31:27,142 --> 01:31:30,043
- Come on, Tristan. It's not that far.
- Okay.

1042
01:31:51,567 --> 01:31:53,262
Excuse me?

1043
01:31:53,368 --> 01:31:56,599
- I think you're in my bath.
- Well, close your eyes!

1044
01:31:58,140 --> 01:32:02,270
I'm not... Honestly, I'm not looking.
Here, I'll turn away.

1045
01:32:07,249 --> 01:32:09,615
All right, you can open them now.

1046
01:32:17,359 --> 01:32:20,487
Did you really mean
what you said in the caravan?

1047
01:32:22,531 --> 01:32:23,793
What I...

1048
01:32:23,899 --> 01:32:26,925
But... But you were a mouse!

1049
01:32:27,369 --> 01:32:30,532
You were a mouse! You wanted cheese!
You didn't...

1050
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:32,470
I asked you to give me a sign.

1051
01:32:32,574 --> 01:32:36,738
And risk you being too embarrassed
to keep saying such lovely things?

1052
01:32:42,084 --> 01:32:45,645
You want to know what the Captain
really whispered to me that day?

1053
01:32:47,990 --> 01:32:52,586
He told me that my true love
was right in front of my eyes.

1054
01:32:54,796 --> 01:32:56,423
And he was right.

1055
01:33:11,211 --> 01:33:14,112
Hey, guys! Guys, come on! Come on,
you got to come up and see this!

1056
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:15,647
No, thank you.

1057
01:33:16,383 --> 01:33:18,442
- Pervert!
- Suit yourself.

1058
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:23,821
- Ironic, isn't it?
- Yeah. What is?

1059
01:33:24,457 --> 01:33:26,516
Septimus will be here by the morning,

1060
01:33:26,626 --> 01:33:30,392
find the girl, get the stone
and be king forever.

1061
01:33:30,497 --> 01:33:31,828
So unjust.

1062
01:33:32,432 --> 01:33:34,730
Still, at least we will be free.

1063
01:33:37,504 --> 01:33:40,837
You're very close.
She's in the market town.

1064
01:33:40,940 --> 01:33:43,238
One mile from the gap in the wall.

1065
01:33:43,343 --> 01:33:45,402
You speak as if this is good news.

1066
01:33:45,512 --> 01:33:49,448
Do I need to remind you that Wall
is not part of our universe?

1067
01:33:49,549 --> 01:33:52,109
If she crosses the threshold
into the human realm,

1068
01:33:52,218 --> 01:33:56,245
our star becomes nothing more
than a pitted lump of metallic rock.

1069
01:33:56,756 --> 01:33:59,156
Then I suggest you hurry up!

1070
01:34:30,323 --> 01:34:31,483
What?

1071
01:34:32,492 --> 01:34:33,652
Oh, what do you want?

1072
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:36,888
Sorry.
Can I have a piece of paper and a pen?

1073
01:34:36,996 --> 01:34:39,863
Ask me again
at a more reasonable hour.

1074
01:34:39,966 --> 01:34:41,058
No, I can't. I have to go.

1075
01:34:41,167 --> 01:34:43,397
Look,
if my friend wakes up before I get back,

1076
01:34:43,503 --> 01:34:45,971
- please, can you give her a message?
- Go on.

1077
01:35:22,575 --> 01:35:26,202
You know, that's the first time
I've ever slept at night.

1078
01:35:27,545 --> 01:35:29,240
I can't believe it.

1079
01:35:33,618 --> 01:35:34,607
Tristan?

1080
01:35:43,895 --> 01:35:45,658
Have you seen my friend?

1081
01:35:45,763 --> 01:35:47,663
He left absurdly early.

1082
01:35:48,866 --> 01:35:50,094
He left?

1083
01:35:50,201 --> 01:35:53,432
He told me to tell you
he's gone to see Victoria

1084
01:35:53,538 --> 01:35:56,439
because he's sorry,
but he's found his true love

1085
01:35:56,541 --> 01:35:59,669
and he wants to spend
the rest of his life with her.

1086
01:36:00,745 --> 01:36:01,837
What?

1087
01:36:02,847 --> 01:36:05,315
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

1088
01:36:34,745 --> 01:36:37,612
Hey! Hey, wait! Wait!

1089
01:37:21,225 --> 01:37:22,715
Happy birthday.

1090
01:37:23,694 --> 01:37:24,991
Tristan.

1091
01:37:26,964 --> 01:37:28,727
What happened to you?

1092
01:37:30,134 --> 01:37:31,761
I found the star.

1093
01:37:33,905 --> 01:37:35,805
I can't believe you did it.

1094
01:37:35,907 --> 01:37:38,375
Where's my star? Can I see it?

1095
01:37:39,510 --> 01:37:41,535
- Is it beautiful?
- Yes.

1096
01:37:43,781 --> 01:37:45,749
Well, it's awfully small.

1097
01:37:46,717 --> 01:37:49,741
Well, that's just a little piece.
A token for your birthday.

1098
01:37:49,852 --> 01:37:52,650
Well... Well, then forget about the star.

1099
01:37:53,956 --> 01:37:56,151
It's not the star that I want.

1100
01:37:58,594 --> 01:38:00,357
You know what I want.

1101
01:38:02,564 --> 01:38:04,395
Yeah. I do.

1102
01:38:09,672 --> 01:38:13,608
You want to grow up
and get over yourself.

1103
01:38:18,414 --> 01:38:20,041
- Humphrey.
- Thorn.

1104
01:38:20,582 --> 01:38:22,675
You must have a death wish.

1105
01:38:30,693 --> 01:38:33,491
Humphrey. Humphrey, it's all right.

1106
01:38:34,129 --> 01:38:35,790
She's all yours.

1107
01:38:35,898 --> 01:38:38,458
You really are a perfect couple.
The best of luck to you both.

1108
01:38:38,567 --> 01:38:43,197
Well, why would I want this?
It's just a measly handful of stardust!

1109
01:38:48,744 --> 01:38:49,870
Yvaine?

1110
01:38:52,014 --> 01:38:53,948
She can't cross the wall.

1111
01:39:02,691 --> 01:39:03,715
Go on!

1112
01:40:11,226 --> 01:40:14,159
Stop! Stop!
If you go through there, you'll die!

1113
01:40:14,261 --> 01:40:15,319
What?

1114
01:40:17,497 --> 01:40:20,694
If you set foot on human soil,
you'll turn to rock.

1115
01:40:21,268 --> 01:40:24,760
Wretched slattern!
Where have you taken me?

1116
01:40:34,114 --> 01:40:36,605
Planning to enter Wall, were you?

1117
01:40:36,716 --> 01:40:41,119
If death is what you wish, my dear,
I'd be more than happy to assist you.

1118
01:40:41,455 --> 01:40:43,355
Are you talking to me?

1119
01:40:44,091 --> 01:40:45,718
You. Small world.

1120
01:40:46,726 --> 01:40:50,059
Anyhow, no, I wasn't.
I was talking to the star.

1121
01:40:50,564 --> 01:40:51,861
What star?

1122
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:57,097
My slave girl's no star.
Any fool can see that.

1123
01:40:57,637 --> 01:41:00,265
If she was,
I'd have had the heart out of her chest

1124
01:41:00,373 --> 01:41:02,898
a long time ago, trust me.

1125
01:41:03,310 --> 01:41:06,711
Trust you? Not a mistake
I'd be likely to make again.

1126
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:10,781
What's it to be, Ditchwater Sal?
Heads or tails?

1127
01:41:40,814 --> 01:41:44,875
- Oh, God. Time to go.
- She's not going anywhere.

1128
01:41:45,018 --> 01:41:46,883
I think you'll find she is.

1129
01:41:46,987 --> 01:41:49,353
It's all right. You can come, too.

1130
01:41:52,259 --> 01:41:56,320
You can ride in the carriage or
be dragged behind it. Your choice.

1131
01:42:16,216 --> 01:42:17,513
What happened?

1132
01:42:17,617 --> 01:42:19,949
Be my guest. I quit.

1133
01:42:20,053 --> 01:42:23,045
Eighty years
I've stopped you people going out.

1134
01:42:23,156 --> 01:42:25,021
What I should have been worrying about

1135
01:42:25,125 --> 01:42:26,615
was those people
from the other side coming in.

1136
01:42:26,726 --> 01:42:28,387
All right,
just tell me what happened!

1137
01:42:28,495 --> 01:42:30,360
What happened? Oh, where to start?

1138
01:42:31,731 --> 01:42:32,698
No!

1139
01:42:46,711 --> 01:42:47,905
Come on!

1140
01:43:17,809 --> 01:43:18,935
Go on!

1141
01:43:49,574 --> 01:43:50,802
The star!

1142
01:43:51,409 --> 01:43:52,376
And who else?

1143
01:43:52,477 --> 01:43:55,605
A slave for us. It will be nice to
have someone to help mop up

1144
01:43:55,713 --> 01:43:57,908
when we've finished with our little guest.

1145
01:43:58,016 --> 01:43:59,415
Oh, good work, sister.

1146
01:43:59,517 --> 01:44:02,418
And just in time, I see! You look awful!

1147
01:45:01,444 --> 01:45:02,843
Who are you?

1148
01:45:04,146 --> 01:45:06,444
What business do you have here?

1149
01:45:07,883 --> 01:45:09,145
Septimus?

1150
01:45:09,685 --> 01:45:11,778
I knew your brother, Primus.

1151
01:45:13,122 --> 01:45:15,647
Unless you wish to meet him
in the afterlife,

1152
01:45:15,758 --> 01:45:18,420
I suggest you answer my question.
What are you doing here?

1153
01:45:18,527 --> 01:45:20,825
I might ask you the same thing.

1154
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:39,445
There are four of them.

1155
01:45:42,418 --> 01:45:45,148
Do as I say and we may stand a chance.

1156
01:45:45,254 --> 01:45:47,745
Wait.
How do I know you can be trusted?

1157
01:45:47,857 --> 01:45:50,451
You don't. Why? Do you have a choice?

1158
01:45:50,559 --> 01:45:52,550
- No.
- Well, then, let's go.

1159
01:45:59,969 --> 01:46:03,564
Get off me! Get off!

1160
01:46:07,810 --> 01:46:10,005
- Una?
- Septimus.

1161
01:46:10,112 --> 01:46:11,579
- Una!
- Sister!

1162
01:46:30,332 --> 01:46:32,197
Tristan! No! Tristan!

1163
01:46:33,436 --> 01:46:36,132
I'm your... I'm your... I'm your mother.

1164
01:46:37,373 --> 01:46:38,931
I'm your mother.

1165
01:47:15,644 --> 01:47:18,238
- Rather well.
- Good riddance to you. Yes.

1166
01:47:57,851 --> 01:48:00,046
Let's put out those flames.

1167
01:48:00,487 --> 01:48:01,784
Shall we?

1168
01:48:52,506 --> 01:48:54,371
So, what happens now?

1169
01:48:55,175 --> 01:48:57,575
We have to learn to live with each other.

1170
01:48:57,678 --> 01:48:58,872
Forever?

1171
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:06,147
Let's get on with it.

1172
01:49:10,090 --> 01:49:12,081
Be the man that I know you are.

1173
01:49:29,876 --> 01:49:31,173
- Get outside.
- Okay.

1174
01:49:31,278 --> 01:49:32,267
Go.

1175
01:49:42,456 --> 01:49:44,321
- Tristan!
- Get him.

1176
01:50:19,991 --> 01:50:21,253
Get off!

1177
01:50:25,397 --> 01:50:27,126
Get out!

1178
01:51:04,302 --> 01:51:08,762
So, what's it to be, Prince Charming?
Frog or tadpole?

1179
01:52:06,831 --> 01:52:08,059
Septimus?

1180
01:53:30,179 --> 01:53:31,339
Tristan!

1181
01:54:15,157 --> 01:54:16,454
Youth.

1182
01:54:17,393 --> 01:54:18,690
Beauty.

1183
01:54:20,496 --> 01:54:22,930
It all seems meaningless now.

1184
01:54:23,633 --> 01:54:25,601
My sisters are dead!

1185
01:54:27,236 --> 01:54:30,899
Everything I cared about gone.

1186
01:54:37,077 --> 01:54:38,169
Go.

1187
01:54:43,651 --> 01:54:44,948
Go!

1188
01:55:05,973 --> 01:55:06,940
No!

1189
01:56:04,064 --> 01:56:05,998
I owe you thanks, boy.

1190
01:56:06,433 --> 01:56:09,527
What use was her heart to me
when it was broken?

1191
01:56:09,970 --> 01:56:14,873
And you got rid of my sisters
and now I can have it all for myself.

1192
01:56:20,748 --> 01:56:23,774
- Hold me tight and close your eyes.
- What? Why?

1193
01:56:24,551 --> 01:56:26,178
What do stars do?

1194
01:56:32,993 --> 01:56:34,153
Shine.

1195
01:57:10,395 --> 01:57:12,056
- Bravo!
- Yeah!

1196
01:57:12,464 --> 01:57:13,761
Very good.

1197
01:57:15,534 --> 01:57:17,058
Why didn't you do that earlier?

1198
01:57:17,169 --> 01:57:21,799
I couldn't have done that without you.
No star can shine with a broken heart.

1199
01:57:23,208 --> 01:57:25,073
I thought I'd lost you.

1200
01:57:26,344 --> 01:57:28,141
But you came back.

1201
01:57:28,547 --> 01:57:30,845
Of course I did. I love you.

1202
01:57:36,421 --> 01:57:37,649
Come on.

1203
01:57:57,742 --> 01:57:59,039
Tristan.

1204
01:58:01,780 --> 01:58:05,272
The last surviving male heir
of the Stormhold bloodline.

1205
01:58:08,053 --> 01:58:09,680
It's you, Tristan.

1206
01:58:13,558 --> 01:58:16,550
But if he's the new King of Stormhold,
then...

1207
01:59:03,642 --> 01:59:08,136
I crown thee King Tristan of Stormhold.

1208
01:59:25,528 --> 01:59:26,927
Yeah!

1209
01:59:42,845 --> 01:59:44,472
My gift to you.

1210
01:59:46,282 --> 01:59:47,681
To you both.

1211
01:59:47,984 --> 01:59:49,315
Thank you.

1212
02:00:04,267 --> 02:00:06,827
<i>They ruled for 80 years.</i>

1213
02:00:08,071 --> 02:00:11,006
<i>But no man can live forever,</i>

1214
02:00:11,908 --> 02:00:15,309
<i>except he who possesses
the heart of a star.</i>

1215
02:00:16,212 --> 02:00:20,615
<i>And Yvaine had given hers
to Tristan completely.</i>

1216
02:00:22,185 --> 02:00:25,484
<i>When their children and grandchildren
were grown,</i>

1217
02:00:26,522 --> 02:00:29,753
<i>it was time to light the Babylon candle.</i>

1218
02:00:35,832 --> 02:00:40,269
<i>And they still live happily ever after.</i>
