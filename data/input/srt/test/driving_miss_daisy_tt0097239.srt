1
00:01:12,862 --> 00:01:14,625
I'm gone to the market, Idella.

2
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:22,133
<i>Pepsodent's new improved formula
cleans teeth whiter than ever.</i>

3
00:02:31,307 --> 00:02:33,468
Are you all right, Miss Daisy?

4
00:02:54,564 --> 00:02:55,895
That's good!

5
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:24,356
You two get back to work.

6
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:06,558
- Mama!
- No!

7
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:11,563
It's a miracle you're not laying at
Emory Hospital or the funeral parlor.

8
00:04:13,743 --> 00:04:15,802
Cucumbers are pretty this summer.

9
00:04:16,078 --> 00:04:18,410
You didn't even break your glasses.

10
00:04:18,648 --> 00:04:20,479
It was the car's fault!

11
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,913
- You had the car in the wrong gear.
- I did not!

12
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,151
Idella, want a pickle with lunch?

13
00:04:26,422 --> 00:04:27,582
Not me.

14
00:04:27,924 --> 00:04:30,916
I'm putting up a jar for
you to take home to William.

15
00:04:32,762 --> 00:04:35,322
You backed the car into
the Pollack's yard.

16
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:39,762
You should have let me keep my Lasalle.
It wouldn't have behaved this way.

17
00:04:40,102 --> 00:04:43,435
Mama, cars don't behave.
They are behaved upon.

18
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:46,105
You demolished that
Chrysler by yourself.

19
00:04:46,342 --> 00:04:48,333
Think what you want.
I know the truth.

20
00:04:48,778 --> 00:04:52,111
The truth is you just cost
the insurance company $2,700.

21
00:04:52,448 --> 00:04:54,109
You are a terrible risk.

22
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,341
Nobody will issue you a policy now.

23
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,851
You're just saying that to be hateful.

24
00:04:59,455 --> 00:05:02,947
Okay. Yes, I am!
I am making it all up.

25
00:05:03,526 --> 00:05:05,118
Look out on the driveway!

26
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:08,457
Every insurance company in
America is out there...

27
00:05:08,698 --> 00:05:11,189
...waving their pens
to get you to sign up.

28
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:16,131
If you're going to stand in my pantry
and lie like a rug, go somewhere else.

29
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,966
I better get back to the office.

30
00:05:21,877 --> 00:05:25,210
Florine will have a fit if I don't
get home on time tonight.

31
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:27,312
You all must have plans tonight.

32
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,211
The Ansleys' dinner party.

33
00:05:29,485 --> 00:05:31,817
This is her idea of heaven on earth.

34
00:05:32,154 --> 00:05:33,154
What?

35
00:05:33,322 --> 00:05:35,813
Socializing with Episcopalians.

36
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:41,890
You are a doodle, Mama!

37
00:05:42,398 --> 00:05:44,059
I'll stop by tomorrow evening.

38
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,733
How do you know I'll be here?

39
00:05:47,003 --> 00:05:48,834
I'm not dependent on you for company.

40
00:05:49,171 --> 00:05:51,162
Fine, I'll call first.

41
00:05:51,574 --> 00:05:54,907
But you know, we have got some
real serious talking to do.

42
00:05:55,177 --> 00:05:56,177
No!

43
00:06:34,383 --> 00:06:38,217
I need you now. I have to be at
the beauty shop in half an hour.

44
00:06:40,122 --> 00:06:44,957
No, I most certainly did not know you
had to call a minimum of 2 hours ahead.

45
00:06:45,294 --> 00:06:49,788
Why call yourself a taxicab company
if you can't provide taxicabs?

46
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,960
Why don't you call your son?
He'd send someone to carry you.

47
00:06:54,236 --> 00:06:55,897
That won't be necessary.

48
00:06:56,238 --> 00:06:59,230
I'll cancel the appointment
and fix my own hair.

49
00:06:59,575 --> 00:07:03,909
Sometimes I think you ain't
got the sense God gave a lemon.

50
00:07:06,315 --> 00:07:08,647
Two dots. I want that!

51
00:07:10,486 --> 00:07:11,976
And a five bamboo.

52
00:07:12,254 --> 00:07:15,246
Well, this is not my day for mah-jongg.

53
00:07:15,491 --> 00:07:16,491
Nine bam!

54
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:21,323
Thank you all for coming here again.
I am a real pariah without my car.

55
00:07:21,597 --> 00:07:23,087
Oh, nonsense!

56
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,156
When do you get the new one?

57
00:07:25,334 --> 00:07:28,497
I don't know! Boolie's
being real pokey about it.

58
00:07:28,771 --> 00:07:31,171
I'll come after you for temple tomorrow.

59
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,431
That's sweet of you, honey.

60
00:07:37,179 --> 00:07:38,510
Mama, you there?

61
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:40,612
It's just us!

62
00:07:40,783 --> 00:07:42,273
Why didn't you call?

63
00:07:42,518 --> 00:07:43,610
We can't stay.

64
00:07:43,853 --> 00:07:45,184
So I gather.

65
00:07:45,454 --> 00:07:47,285
The Millers are giving a hay ride.

66
00:07:47,456 --> 00:07:50,789
I had these made.
Doesn't your baby look cute?

67
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:53,859
Well, it's not exactly
the word I'd pick.

68
00:07:55,464 --> 00:07:58,297
New Graham Greene?
I been wanting to read that.

69
00:07:58,634 --> 00:08:01,797
Sorry, but it's due back
at the library tomorrow.

70
00:08:02,037 --> 00:08:04,198
- Want me to return it for you?
- No, thank you.

71
00:08:04,473 --> 00:08:07,135
I'll go to the library on the streetcar.

72
00:08:07,877 --> 00:08:12,371
Damn it, Mama! Quit being so stubborn.
You know perfectly well...

73
00:08:12,815 --> 00:08:15,716
Go on! Don't keep the horses waiting.

74
00:08:16,485 --> 00:08:17,645
Bye!

75
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:33,158
Is that door making contact?

76
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:40,241
Oscar?

77
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:41,409
I'm here.

78
00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:44,239
- Are you all right?
- No, sir, I'm stuck.

79
00:08:44,513 --> 00:08:46,674
I know. Fiddle with the lever.

80
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:49,409
It fiddled out. I done all I know how.

81
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,183
Call Bell Elevator.

82
00:08:53,422 --> 00:08:56,755
I already did. They're
backed up until around 1:00.

83
00:08:57,092 --> 00:08:58,753
Did you tell them it's an emergency!

84
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:01,428
You don't have to holler, Mr. Werthan.

85
00:09:01,697 --> 00:09:03,927
I did not break the elevator.

86
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,691
Got that stuff for Davis & Paxon?

87
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:08,597
Wrapped and ready to go!

88
00:09:08,771 --> 00:09:11,433
I promised it for today.
Call Bell again.

89
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,111
I hear you.

90
00:09:19,882 --> 00:09:24,376
Look up where the gate is supposed
to close. See a do-hickey?

91
00:09:24,553 --> 00:09:25,884
Wait a minute.

92
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:28,289
Right here!

93
00:09:28,457 --> 00:09:31,722
Reach up and mash it
up until it catches.

94
00:09:33,796 --> 00:09:35,627
I done it. Now what?

95
00:09:36,065 --> 00:09:37,555
Operate the lever.

96
00:09:49,812 --> 00:09:51,143
Do you work here?

97
00:09:51,313 --> 00:09:52,974
No, sir. This here Hoke.

98
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:54,580
Hoke Colburn, sir.

99
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:56,248
How'd you know about the elevator?

100
00:09:56,418 --> 00:09:58,750
I used to drive for a dairy, sir.

101
00:09:59,154 --> 00:10:01,816
Their elevator was
worse than this one.

102
00:10:02,024 --> 00:10:04,151
Hoke the one I told you about.

103
00:10:04,426 --> 00:10:05,484
Of course.

104
00:10:17,606 --> 00:10:18,937
Excuse me, sir.

105
00:10:19,275 --> 00:10:21,266
Y'all people's Jewish, ain't you?

106
00:10:21,443 --> 00:10:22,842
Yeah, we are. Why?

107
00:10:23,112 --> 00:10:25,273
I'd rather work for Jews.

108
00:10:25,614 --> 00:10:28,344
I know folks say they stingy and cheap.

109
00:10:28,617 --> 00:10:30,847
But don't say none of that around me!

110
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,781
Good to know you feel that way.

111
00:10:55,144 --> 00:10:56,577
What was your last job?

112
00:10:56,745 --> 00:11:00,977
I worked for Judge Harold
Stone, a Jewish gentleman.

113
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,649
You worked for Judge Stone?

114
00:11:02,918 --> 00:11:06,911
Seven years. I'd still be
there if he didn't up and die.

115
00:11:07,256 --> 00:11:10,089
Mrs. Stone asked me to move
to Savannah with her.

116
00:11:10,326 --> 00:11:12,760
Of course, my wife was dead by then.

117
00:11:12,995 --> 00:11:15,156
But I said, "No, thank you, ma'am."

118
00:11:15,431 --> 00:11:18,093
I didn't want to be too
far from my grandbabies.

119
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:19,928
Judge Stone was my father's friend.

120
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:21,500
You don't say?

121
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,770
Sit.

122
00:11:23,505 --> 00:11:25,496
Later, Miss McClatchey.

123
00:11:28,677 --> 00:11:31,840
Oscar said you needed somebody
to drive for your family.

124
00:11:32,114 --> 00:11:34,674
Will I be taking your
children to school...

125
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,941
...and your wife to the beauty parlor?

126
00:11:37,286 --> 00:11:39,948
I don't have any children.
What I need...

127
00:11:40,622 --> 00:11:43,614
You're still a young man.
Don't worry too much.

128
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,121
Thank you. I won't.

129
00:11:46,628 --> 00:11:49,620
Hoke, I need somebody
to drive my mother around.

130
00:11:50,966 --> 00:11:54,800
Yes. Well, if you don't
mind my asking, sir...

131
00:11:55,137 --> 00:11:57,628
...why ain't she hiring for herself?

132
00:12:00,142 --> 00:12:02,133
It's a difficult situation.

133
00:12:02,978 --> 00:12:05,469
She done gone around the bend a little.

134
00:12:05,714 --> 00:12:07,875
That will happen as they get on.

135
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,640
No, she's all there!

136
00:12:10,152 --> 00:12:11,983
Too much there is the problem!

137
00:12:15,057 --> 00:12:17,218
I want you to understand something.

138
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:20,560
My mother is a little high strung.

139
00:12:22,164 --> 00:12:25,156
The fact is, you would
be working for me.

140
00:12:25,401 --> 00:12:27,733
She can say anything she likes...

141
00:12:28,003 --> 00:12:30,995
...but she can't fire you. Understand?

142
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:33,338
Yes, sir.

143
00:12:34,843 --> 00:12:36,504
Yes, sir, I sure do.

144
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:38,508
Don't worry, Mr. Werthan.

145
00:12:38,914 --> 00:12:41,576
I'll hold on no matter
which way she run me.

146
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:46,014
I was a little boy back on the farm
above Macon where I come from.

147
00:12:46,355 --> 00:12:49,188
I wrestled hogs to the
ground during killing time.

148
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:53,017
Well, sir, there ain't a
hog got away from me yet!

149
00:13:41,143 --> 00:13:42,804
How are you, Idella?

150
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:44,238
Living.

151
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,743
- Where's the new vacuum cleaner?
- In the closet.

152
00:13:47,983 --> 00:13:49,143
She won't touch it.

153
00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:52,080
It gives me a shock
every time I'm near it.

154
00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:53,585
It works for me.

155
00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:57,748
Good! Then you clean and I'll
go down and run your office.

156
00:13:58,494 --> 00:13:59,825
Where's Mama?

157
00:14:00,095 --> 00:14:01,426
Up yonder.

158
00:14:01,763 --> 00:14:03,594
I guess you know who this is.

159
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:07,426
I'll be right back.

160
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,831
I wouldn't be in your shoes...

161
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:18,005
...if the sweet Lord Jesus came
down and asked me Himself.

162
00:14:27,623 --> 00:14:28,783
Good morning, Mama.

163
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:41,197
Just come down and say hello.

164
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,960
You listen here.

165
00:14:43,205 --> 00:14:47,039
Unless they rewrote the Constitution
and didn't tell me, I still have rights!

166
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:48,309
Of course.

167
00:14:48,544 --> 00:14:53,140
What I do not want, and absolutely
will not have, is...

168
00:14:53,482 --> 00:14:57,714
...some chauffeur sitting in my kitchen,
gobbling my food, using my phone.

169
00:14:57,986 --> 00:14:59,647
I hate that in my house.

170
00:14:59,888 --> 00:15:00,980
You have Idella.

171
00:15:01,156 --> 00:15:04,216
Idella's different!
She's been coming to me for years.

172
00:15:04,493 --> 00:15:06,723
We stay out of each other's way.

173
00:15:06,995 --> 00:15:10,328
Even so, there are chips
in my wedding china.

174
00:15:10,566 --> 00:15:13,899
You think Idella has a vendetta
against your wedding china?

175
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:15,500
Don't be sassy.

176
00:15:15,904 --> 00:15:18,896
When we couldn't afford them,
we did for ourselves.

177
00:15:19,074 --> 00:15:20,735
That's still the best way.

178
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:25,173
"Them?" "Afford them?"
You sound like Governor Talmadge.

179
00:15:25,414 --> 00:15:28,406
What a thing to say!
I'm not prejudiced!

180
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,411
Aren't you ashamed?!

181
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,750
You might as well make the best of it.

182
00:16:35,484 --> 00:16:38,976
I knew a Miss Idella once.
Back down in Macon.

183
00:16:39,254 --> 00:16:40,744
You don't say?

184
00:16:41,423 --> 00:16:42,423
She sang!

185
00:16:42,758 --> 00:16:44,919
What are you talking about?

186
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,492
I'm talking about this
woman had some lungs!

187
00:16:47,763 --> 00:16:50,755
She'd be a whole church
choir by herself!

188
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:52,159
I declare!

189
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:53,763
Fat, too!

190
00:16:53,935 --> 00:16:55,766
She was as big as that stove!

191
00:16:58,707 --> 00:17:01,870
Don't talk to Idella!
She has work to do.

192
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,451
What are you doing?

193
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:19,124
Dusting the bulbs, Miss Daisy.

194
00:17:19,294 --> 00:17:21,785
That's the silliest thing I ever saw.

195
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,191
Who cares if lamp bulbs are dusty?

196
00:17:24,366 --> 00:17:25,856
Get down from there!

197
00:17:26,868 --> 00:17:29,530
Put that ladder away
before somebody trips.

198
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:35,976
I'm gone, Miss Daisy.

199
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:38,543
All right, Idella. See you tomorrow.

200
00:17:39,314 --> 00:17:42,477
- I'm going too, Miss Daisy.
- Good.

201
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,663
Good morning, Miss Daisy.
Thought I'd see after your zinnias.

202
00:18:02,904 --> 00:18:05,168
Leave me flower bed alone.

203
00:18:06,508 --> 00:18:11,172
You got a nice piece of ground behind
the garage that ain't doing nothing.

204
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:12,937
I could put in tomatoes...

205
00:18:13,749 --> 00:18:17,412
If I want a vegetable garden,
I'll plant it myself.

206
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,279
What are you doing?

207
00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:57,381
I just love a house with
pictures, Miss Daisy.

208
00:18:57,626 --> 00:18:59,116
It do make a home.

209
00:18:59,394 --> 00:19:02,557
I don't want you nosing
through my things.

210
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:15,736
Good morning, Miss Daisy.

211
00:19:17,145 --> 00:19:19,477
It was right cold in the night.

212
00:19:19,748 --> 00:19:22,080
I wouldn't know. I was asleep.

213
00:19:26,154 --> 00:19:28,714
Idella says we're
running short on coffee...

214
00:19:28,824 --> 00:19:30,257
...and Dutch cleanser.

215
00:19:30,926 --> 00:19:31,926
We are?

216
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,160
Yes, ma'am.

217
00:19:33,328 --> 00:19:35,660
We're low on silver polish, too.

218
00:19:36,832 --> 00:19:38,322
I know.

219
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:42,593
I'm fixing to go to the
Piggly Wiggly on the trolley.

220
00:19:42,938 --> 00:19:46,601
On the trolley!
Why don't you let me carry you?

221
00:19:46,842 --> 00:19:48,002
No, thank you.

222
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,371
Ain't that why Mr. Werthan hired me?

223
00:19:50,545 --> 00:19:52,206
That's his problem.

224
00:19:52,781 --> 00:19:56,615
All right. But I'm going to
find something to do here.

225
00:19:56,785 --> 00:19:58,616
You leave my things alone!

226
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:02,120
I'm gone to the market, Idella.

227
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:05,453
Miss Daisy, it's a shame.

228
00:20:05,794 --> 00:20:09,457
You have this fine Hudson
automobile out there in the garage.

229
00:20:09,698 --> 00:20:13,691
It hasn't moved an inch from
when Mr. Werthan drove it here.

230
00:20:14,135 --> 00:20:17,696
That insurance company gave you
a brand new car for nothing.

231
00:20:17,973 --> 00:20:19,235
That's your opinion.

232
00:20:20,642 --> 00:20:24,976
My other opinion is that a fine rich,
Jewish lady like yourself...

233
00:20:25,213 --> 00:20:30,048
...has no business dragging herself
onto a trolley carrying grocery bags.

234
00:20:30,552 --> 00:20:32,213
I'll carry them for you.

235
00:20:32,487 --> 00:20:33,818
I don't need you!

236
00:20:34,155 --> 00:20:37,249
I don't want you!
And don't say I'm rich!

237
00:20:37,525 --> 00:20:40,358
- I won't say it no more.
- Is that what you and Idella talk about?

238
00:20:41,496 --> 00:20:44,556
I hate being discussed behind
my back in my own house!

239
00:20:45,901 --> 00:20:48,062
I was born on Forsyth Street.

240
00:20:48,336 --> 00:20:50,497
Believe me. I know
the value of a penny!

241
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:53,171
My brother brought
home a white cat once.

242
00:20:53,408 --> 00:20:56,502
We couldn't keep it because
we couldn't afford to feed it!

243
00:20:56,912 --> 00:20:58,504
My sister saved up money...

244
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,913
...so I could become a teacher!
We had nothing!

245
00:21:03,018 --> 00:21:05,350
But you're doing all right now!

246
00:21:28,576 --> 00:21:30,066
What are you doing?!

247
00:21:30,345 --> 00:21:32,836
I'm trying to drive you to the store!

248
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:42,251
Where are you off to this
morning, Miss Werthan?

249
00:21:42,524 --> 00:21:44,185
Just a little shopping.

250
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,693
Go away! I've ridden the trolley
with the groceries plenty of times!

251
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:53,765
But I can't keep taking
Mr. Werthan's money for doing nothing.

252
00:21:54,102 --> 00:21:55,763
How much he pay you?

253
00:21:56,204 --> 00:21:58,866
Miss Daisy, that's between him and me.

254
00:21:59,107 --> 00:22:03,441
Anything over $7 a week
is highway robbery!

255
00:22:03,712 --> 00:22:05,771
You sure are right about that!

256
00:22:06,047 --> 00:22:07,981
Especially since I don't do nothing...

257
00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:10,176
...but sit on a stool all day.

258
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:13,447
All right!

259
00:22:14,723 --> 00:22:16,054
Piggly Wiggly.

260
00:22:16,624 --> 00:22:19,286
Then home. Nowhere else.

261
00:22:34,743 --> 00:22:37,906
Oh, I just love the smell of a new car.

262
00:22:38,146 --> 00:22:39,977
Don't you, Miss Daisy?

263
00:22:43,651 --> 00:22:45,642
I am nobody's fool, Hoke.

264
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,251
I know!

265
00:22:47,489 --> 00:22:49,923
My husband taught me to run a car.

266
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:53,091
I remember everything he said.

267
00:22:53,328 --> 00:22:55,990
So don't think even for a second you...

268
00:22:56,264 --> 00:22:58,164
Wait. You're speeding.

269
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,664
I can see it!

270
00:23:00,001 --> 00:23:02,492
We only going 19 miles an hour.

271
00:23:02,771 --> 00:23:05,103
I like to go under the speed limit.

272
00:23:05,607 --> 00:23:07,598
But the speed limit is 35 here.

273
00:23:07,842 --> 00:23:10,504
The slower you go the more gas you save.

274
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:12,940
My husband taught me that!

275
00:23:14,949 --> 00:23:17,679
Ain't hardly moving.
Might as well walk...

276
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:19,509
...to Piggly Wiggly.

277
00:23:20,121 --> 00:23:21,748
Is this your car?

278
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:24,284
No.

279
00:23:24,526 --> 00:23:26,118
Do you pay for the gas?

280
00:23:28,196 --> 00:23:30,130
- No.
- All right, then!

281
00:23:30,465 --> 00:23:32,797
My son thinks I'm losing my abilities...

282
00:23:33,034 --> 00:23:36,367
...but I am still in control
of what goes on in my car!

283
00:23:39,974 --> 00:23:41,464
Where are you going?

284
00:23:42,477 --> 00:23:44,468
To the store, like you said.

285
00:23:44,712 --> 00:23:46,703
Why didn't you turn on Highland?

286
00:23:46,981 --> 00:23:48,972
Piggly Wiggly ain't on Highland.

287
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,483
I know where it is!
Now take Highland Avenue.

288
00:23:52,654 --> 00:23:55,555
- That's 3 blocks out of the way.
- Go back this minute!

289
00:23:55,824 --> 00:23:58,622
- I can't turn now.
- I've been driving to Piggly Wiggly...

290
00:23:58,827 --> 00:24:02,490
...since it opened for business.
This isn't the way!

291
00:24:02,897 --> 00:24:04,387
Go back this minute!

292
00:24:04,566 --> 00:24:08,058
Miss Daisy, look. Yonder
is the Piggly Wiggly. See?

293
00:24:10,738 --> 00:24:12,399
Get ready to turn.

294
00:24:19,914 --> 00:24:21,745
Look out. There's a little girl
behind that car.

295
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,643
Yes, I see her.

296
00:24:23,918 --> 00:24:25,408
Pull in right here.

297
00:24:34,262 --> 00:24:35,422
Wait.

298
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,363
Give me the keys.

299
00:24:43,438 --> 00:24:45,599
Stay right here by the car.

300
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,602
And don't tell everyone my business.

301
00:25:13,234 --> 00:25:14,565
Mr. Werthan?

302
00:25:16,404 --> 00:25:19,567
Yes, sir, it's me! Guess where I'm at.

303
00:25:20,408 --> 00:25:22,899
I just drove your mama to the store!

304
00:25:23,578 --> 00:25:28,413
You know, she flapped around some,
but she's all right. She's in the store.

305
00:25:30,151 --> 00:25:33,746
Oh, Lord, she just looked
out the window and seen me.

306
00:25:33,988 --> 00:25:37,480
She'll probably throw a fit right
there at the check-out counter.

307
00:25:38,493 --> 00:25:42,827
Yes, sir. You are right about that.
It only took me 6 days.

308
00:25:43,097 --> 00:25:46,089
Same time it took the
Lord to make the world.

309
00:25:46,601 --> 00:25:48,933
Yes, sir. All right. 'Bye.

310
00:26:00,114 --> 00:26:03,447
Hey Oscar, Junior. How you
old boys doing today?

311
00:26:03,751 --> 00:26:05,616
How the lady been treating you?

312
00:26:05,954 --> 00:26:09,617
I'll tell you one thing;
She knows how to throw a fit.

313
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:12,119
What's so funny?

314
00:26:14,362 --> 00:26:17,297
Nothing, Miss Daisy.
We just carrying on.

315
00:26:17,532 --> 00:26:21,696
Oscar and Junior been doing cleaning
here for 15 years. Never carried on before!

316
00:26:22,704 --> 00:26:24,035
Leave them alone.

317
00:26:24,973 --> 00:26:26,463
Put your coat on.
We're late.

318
00:26:28,309 --> 00:26:30,641
Idella, I'm gone now.

319
00:26:31,646 --> 00:26:33,637
I'm right behind her.

320
00:26:41,155 --> 00:26:45,819
Hear, oh Israel, the Lord
our God, the Lord is one.

321
00:27:30,705 --> 00:27:34,698
Such a nice man. And such a good,
short sermon, wasn't it?

322
00:27:43,117 --> 00:27:44,778
I can get it myself!

323
00:27:45,053 --> 00:27:46,543
Hurry out of here!

324
00:28:03,471 --> 00:28:05,735
Is something wrong, Miss Daisy?

325
00:28:07,241 --> 00:28:08,731
Something I done?

326
00:28:11,813 --> 00:28:12,973
Yes.

327
00:28:13,748 --> 00:28:15,238
I haven't done anything.

328
00:28:15,483 --> 00:28:20,318
You parked the car right in front of the
temple, like I was the Queen of Romania.

329
00:28:20,588 --> 00:28:22,249
Everybody saw you!

330
00:28:22,657 --> 00:28:24,488
I said to wait for me in back.

331
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:27,751
Yes, Ma'am, but I was just trying to...

332
00:28:28,096 --> 00:28:30,587
There were two chauffeurs
right behind me.

333
00:28:30,932 --> 00:28:33,992
You made me look like a fool.
A g.d. fool!

334
00:28:34,268 --> 00:28:38,432
Oh, Miss Daisy, Lord
knows you ain't no fool!

335
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,171
Slow down!

336
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:46,444
Miriam and Beulah, I could see what
they were thinking when we came out.

337
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:48,012
What's that?

338
00:28:48,783 --> 00:28:50,944
That I was pretending to be rich!

339
00:28:51,185 --> 00:28:53,517
- You is rich.
- No, I'm not!

340
00:28:53,788 --> 00:28:55,949
Nobody can say I put on airs.

341
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,785
On Forsyth Street we made many
meals of grits and gravy.

342
00:29:00,027 --> 00:29:02,188
I have done without plenty of times.

343
00:29:02,463 --> 00:29:06,456
Miss Daisy, if I was to ever
get my hands on what you got...

344
00:29:06,968 --> 00:29:10,961
...shoot, I'd shake it around
for everyone in the world to see.

345
00:29:11,205 --> 00:29:13,867
That's vulgar! Don't talk to me!

346
00:29:16,043 --> 00:29:18,705
Never understand some white folks.

347
00:29:19,046 --> 00:29:20,877
What was that?! I heard that!

348
00:29:21,215 --> 00:29:24,707
Now, Miss Daisy...
you needs a chauffeur...

349
00:29:25,386 --> 00:29:27,217
...and Lord knows I need a job.

350
00:29:27,488 --> 00:29:30,480
So why don't we just leave it at that?

351
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,771
Good morning, Mama.
What's the matter?

352
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:33,884
No, I don't always think
something's wrong when you call.

353
00:30:34,121 --> 00:30:36,453
Just when you call so early.

354
00:30:37,892 --> 00:30:39,018
What?!

355
00:30:40,728 --> 00:30:44,721
All right. I'll be there
as soon as I can.

356
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,231
I better get on over there.

357
00:30:51,572 --> 00:30:52,732
'Bye.

358
00:30:53,574 --> 00:30:54,574
Come on.

359
00:30:54,642 --> 00:30:57,736
It's not healthy to rush like this.

360
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:00,240
I eat too much, anyway.

361
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:03,750
Besides, it sounds like she needs me.

362
00:31:03,985 --> 00:31:07,250
When doesn't it?
Give Mother Werthan my love.

363
00:31:13,494 --> 00:31:15,155
Coffee, Katie Bell!

364
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:29,402
I didn't expect to
find you in one piece.

365
00:31:29,644 --> 00:31:32,272
I wanted you to be here
when he comes.

366
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,904
I wanted you to hear it
for yourself.

367
00:31:34,081 --> 00:31:35,742
What is going on?

368
00:31:35,983 --> 00:31:38,144
He's stealing from me.

369
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:40,650
Hoke? Are you sure?

370
00:31:40,922 --> 00:31:43,914
I don't make empty accusations.
I have proof!

371
00:31:44,825 --> 00:31:49,319
This! I found it hidden in the
garbage under some coffee grounds.

372
00:31:49,931 --> 00:31:53,332
- He stole a can of salmon?
- Here it is!

373
00:31:53,601 --> 00:31:56,092
I knew there was something funny.

374
00:31:56,337 --> 00:31:59,932
They all take things, you know.
So I counted.

375
00:32:00,841 --> 00:32:02,502
The silverware first.

376
00:32:02,777 --> 00:32:06,178
Then the linen napkins.
And then I went into the pantry.

377
00:32:07,448 --> 00:32:11,612
And the first thing that
caught my eye was a hole...

378
00:32:11,852 --> 00:32:13,513
...behind the lima beans.

379
00:32:13,854 --> 00:32:15,947
And I knew right away.

380
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:20,693
There are only 8 cans of salmon.
I had 9!

381
00:32:20,861 --> 00:32:22,351
3 for $1 on sale.

382
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,291
Very clever, Mama.

383
00:32:24,632 --> 00:32:27,294
I missed my breakfast and
I'm late to a meeting...

384
00:32:27,535 --> 00:32:29,799
...for a 33c can of salmon?

385
00:32:30,137 --> 00:32:32,128
You want 33c? Here's $1!

386
00:32:32,306 --> 00:32:35,298
Here's $10! Buy yourself
a pantry full of salmon!

387
00:32:35,476 --> 00:32:37,137
Why, Boolie, the idea!

388
00:32:37,311 --> 00:32:39,472
Waving money at me like that!

389
00:32:39,714 --> 00:32:42,148
I don't want money.
I want my things!

390
00:32:42,483 --> 00:32:45,816
- One can of salmon?
- Well, it was mine!

391
00:32:46,654 --> 00:32:49,316
I leave him plenty of food every day.

392
00:32:49,657 --> 00:32:52,148
I tell him exactly what it is.

393
00:32:52,393 --> 00:32:55,988
Like children. If they want
something, they just take it!

394
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,888
He'll never admit this.

395
00:32:58,065 --> 00:33:01,228
"No," he'll say, "I don't
know nothing about that!"

396
00:33:01,502 --> 00:33:05,336
I don't like it! I don't
like living with no privacy.

397
00:33:07,575 --> 00:33:11,011
Go ahead, defend him.
You always do!

398
00:33:11,412 --> 00:33:15,746
I give up! You want to drive again,
arrange your own insurance.

399
00:33:16,017 --> 00:33:17,177
Take the trolley.

400
00:33:17,518 --> 00:33:20,351
Buy yourself a taxicab!
Anything you want!

401
00:33:20,688 --> 00:33:22,849
Just leave me out of it!

402
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,751
Why, Boolie!

403
00:33:29,864 --> 00:33:33,356
What's he doing here
this time of morning?

404
00:33:33,701 --> 00:33:36,363
Can't be good, I promise you that!

405
00:33:50,117 --> 00:33:53,052
I think it's fixing to
clear up out there!

406
00:33:53,888 --> 00:33:56,550
Excuse me, Mr. Werthan.
Y'all busy?

407
00:33:57,224 --> 00:33:59,784
We have to have a little talk, Hoke.

408
00:34:01,896 --> 00:34:05,059
All right, just let me
get out of my coat.

409
00:34:12,807 --> 00:34:16,299
Yesterday, while you were out,
I ate a can of your salmon.

410
00:34:16,577 --> 00:34:20,911
Now I know you said to eat
the leftover pork chops.

411
00:34:21,649 --> 00:34:23,480
Well, they were kind of stiff.

412
00:34:23,818 --> 00:34:27,310
So, I stopped by the Piggly
Wiggly and got you another can.

413
00:34:27,588 --> 00:34:29,647
Do you want me to put it on the shelf?

414
00:34:31,425 --> 00:34:33,586
Yes, thank you, Hoke.

415
00:34:34,095 --> 00:34:35,756
Be right with you, Mr. Werthan.

416
00:34:38,265 --> 00:34:41,428
Well, I got to get dressed now.

417
00:34:42,269 --> 00:34:43,930
Good-bye, son.

418
00:36:23,771 --> 00:36:27,434
You know, Miss Daisy,
I was just thinking.

419
00:36:28,275 --> 00:36:31,608
We been out to this cemetery
3 times this month already.

420
00:36:31,779 --> 00:36:33,371
It ain't even the 20th yet.

421
00:36:33,614 --> 00:36:35,275
It's good to come in nice weather.

422
00:36:35,549 --> 00:36:39,041
Yes, ma'am. You sure
right about that. Sure is.

423
00:36:41,288 --> 00:36:44,621
Mr. Sig's grave is mighty well tended.

424
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:48,551
I think you're the best widow
in the State of Georgia.

425
00:36:48,896 --> 00:36:52,889
Boolie's always pestering me to have
the staff here tend to this plot.

426
00:36:53,234 --> 00:36:55,566
"Perpetual care," they call it.

427
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,961
Well, don't you do it!

428
00:36:58,305 --> 00:37:01,968
It's right to have member of
the family looking after you.

429
00:37:02,243 --> 00:37:06,907
I'll never have that! Boolie will have
me in perpetual care before I'm cold.

430
00:37:08,415 --> 00:37:11,907
Miss Daisy, you ought to
go on away from here!

431
00:37:14,255 --> 00:37:17,088
Put that azalea on Leo Bauer's grave.

432
00:37:17,758 --> 00:37:21,751
Leo Bauer. Is that Miss
Rose Bauer's husband?

433
00:37:22,263 --> 00:37:24,754
She asked me to bring it out here.

434
00:37:26,934 --> 00:37:29,095
Where is his grave at, Miss Daisy?

435
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:34,334
I'm not exactly sure. I know
it's two rows over that way.

436
00:37:35,175 --> 00:37:37,507
You'll see the headstone, "Bauer."

437
00:37:41,348 --> 00:37:42,610
What's wrong?

438
00:37:42,783 --> 00:37:45,946
Nothing wrong.
Nothing the matter at all.

439
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,791
Now, you say...

440
00:37:54,962 --> 00:37:59,296
I told you it's two rows over that way.
It says "Bauer" on the headstone.

441
00:38:01,502 --> 00:38:03,163
What that look like?

442
00:38:03,637 --> 00:38:05,036
What are you talking about?

443
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,371
I'm talking about I can't read, ma'am.

444
00:38:10,644 --> 00:38:11,644
What?!

445
00:38:11,745 --> 00:38:13,610
I can't read, Miss Daisy.

446
00:38:13,981 --> 00:38:16,211
You look at the paper all the time.

447
00:38:16,483 --> 00:38:20,146
Well, that's just it. I just be looking!

448
00:38:20,487 --> 00:38:22,819
I try to dope out what's going on...

449
00:38:23,057 --> 00:38:24,388
...from the pictures.

450
00:38:24,658 --> 00:38:26,148
You know your letters?

451
00:38:26,393 --> 00:38:29,988
Yes, ma'am. I know my ABC's.
I just can't read.

452
00:38:30,431 --> 00:38:32,524
Stop saying that!
You're making me mad!

453
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,991
If you know letters, then you can read.

454
00:38:36,403 --> 00:38:38,234
You just don't know you can read.

455
00:38:39,173 --> 00:38:42,836
I taught some of the stupidest
children God ever put on this earth.

456
00:38:43,077 --> 00:38:46,240
And they all could read enough
to find a name on a tombstone.

457
00:38:47,081 --> 00:38:49,174
The name is "Bauer."

458
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:56,583
"Bauer!" What does that "buh"
letter sound like?

459
00:38:58,525 --> 00:39:00,686
- B?
- Of course!

460
00:39:03,864 --> 00:39:06,355
"Er." That is the last part. "Bauer!"

461
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,261
What letter sounds like "er"?

462
00:39:10,704 --> 00:39:11,704
R!

463
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:14,067
- So the first letter is...
- B!

464
00:39:14,241 --> 00:39:15,572
And the last letter?

465
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:16,809
R!

466
00:39:17,211 --> 00:39:19,042
B-R. Brr.

467
00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:21,941
It even sounds like Bauer, doesn't it?

468
00:39:22,383 --> 00:39:26,444
It sure do, Miss Daisy! It sure do!

469
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:32,281
- That it?
- That's it.

470
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,052
- What about the middle?
- Not right now.

471
00:39:37,297 --> 00:39:40,232
This will be enough for you to find it.

472
00:40:03,424 --> 00:40:05,255
B at the beginning.

473
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,921
R at the end.

474
00:40:15,102 --> 00:40:17,263
B... R.

475
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:19,770
That's it.

476
00:40:20,941 --> 00:40:22,602
That's all right!

477
00:40:39,526 --> 00:40:41,517
I sure do appreciate this!

478
00:40:41,695 --> 00:40:43,959
Don't be ridiculous!

479
00:40:44,798 --> 00:40:49,132
Let's get all this back in the car.
I'm burning up.

480
00:41:13,193 --> 00:41:15,024
Of course I told you!

481
00:41:15,729 --> 00:41:17,720
Of course I told you!

482
00:41:18,732 --> 00:41:22,725
How can I be expected to buy it
if you don't write it down?!

483
00:41:23,003 --> 00:41:24,834
I'm sorry, Miss Florine.

484
00:41:30,344 --> 00:41:31,834
I need you.

485
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,842
I'll be right there.

486
00:41:34,081 --> 00:41:37,915
Do you have any idea what it takes
to give a Christmas reception?

487
00:41:38,252 --> 00:41:40,243
It takes an eye for detail.

488
00:41:41,355 --> 00:41:44,847
I told you a million times,
Katie Bell, write it down!

489
00:41:45,192 --> 00:41:47,183
More I cannot do!

490
00:41:47,861 --> 00:41:49,522
We are out of coconut.

491
00:41:49,763 --> 00:41:51,594
I'm sure we can manage.

492
00:41:51,765 --> 00:41:54,859
- I told her.
- You didn't write it down!

493
00:41:55,269 --> 00:41:59,103
I don't need to stand and
listen to excuses on Christmas.

494
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:04,204
You figure out how to serve ambrosia to
50 people without coconut. I give up!

495
00:42:09,616 --> 00:42:13,052
Don't worry, Katie Bell.
It's not quite the end of the world.

496
00:42:24,565 --> 00:42:28,399
Everybody's giving the Georgia
Power Company a merry Christmas.

497
00:42:29,069 --> 00:42:33,472
Bet Miss Florine beat them all,
especially with the new house.

498
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,740
Absurd!

499
00:42:34,975 --> 00:42:39,810
If I had a nose like Florine, I wouldn't
say, "Merry Christmas" to anybody.

500
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:47,584
I enjoy Christmas at their house.

501
00:42:48,889 --> 00:42:50,754
No wonder. You're the
only Christian in the place.

502
00:42:50,991 --> 00:42:52,822
They got that new cook.

503
00:42:53,093 --> 00:42:57,757
Florine never could keep help.
Of course, it's none of my affair.

504
00:42:58,265 --> 00:43:01,996
Too much running around.
The Garden Club this...

505
00:43:02,169 --> 00:43:05,502
...the Junior League that.
As if they'd give her the time of day.

506
00:43:05,772 --> 00:43:10,436
She'd die before she'd fix a glass of
iced tea for the Temple Sisterhood.

507
00:43:12,012 --> 00:43:16,346
I hope she doesn't take it into
her head to sing this year.

508
00:43:21,188 --> 00:43:24,680
Lord have mercy!
Look what Miss Florine done.

509
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:28,621
If her grandfather, old man
Frietag, could see this.

510
00:43:28,962 --> 00:43:30,452
What is it you say?

511
00:43:30,697 --> 00:43:35,031
I bet he'd jump out of his
grave and snatch her baldheaded.

512
00:43:44,311 --> 00:43:46,973
Jump up and snatch her baldheaded.

513
00:43:48,548 --> 00:43:51,881
Oh, Miss Daisy, you
go on away from here.

514
00:44:00,894 --> 00:44:02,225
Wait a minute.

515
00:44:02,729 --> 00:44:04,720
This isn't a Christmas present.

516
00:44:05,832 --> 00:44:08,323
You know I don't give
Christmas presents.

517
00:44:09,569 --> 00:44:11,230
I happened to run
across it this morning.

518
00:44:12,172 --> 00:44:14,003
Well, go on, open it.

519
00:44:21,848 --> 00:44:23,179
Look at that.

520
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:26,580
Ain't nobody never gave
me no book before.

521
00:44:28,522 --> 00:44:31,013
"Zaner Method Writing."

522
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:34,418
I always taught out of these.
I saved a few.

523
00:44:35,595 --> 00:44:37,927
It's faded, but it works.

524
00:44:38,265 --> 00:44:40,597
If you practice, you'll write nicely.

525
00:44:40,867 --> 00:44:42,425
But you have to practice.

526
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:47,203
I taught Mayor Hartsfield
out of the same book.

527
00:44:47,441 --> 00:44:48,999
I sure do thank you.

528
00:44:49,209 --> 00:44:50,870
It's not a Christmas present.

529
00:44:51,111 --> 00:44:54,103
Jews have no business
giving Christmas presents.

530
00:44:54,448 --> 00:44:57,884
You don't have to go yapping
about this to Boolie or Florine.

531
00:44:58,118 --> 00:44:59,949
This is between you and me.

532
00:45:01,555 --> 00:45:03,386
Merry Christmas, Mother Werthan.

533
00:45:03,724 --> 00:45:05,885
I hope I don't spit up.

534
00:45:06,226 --> 00:45:08,217
Merry Christmas, Mama. Hoke.

535
00:45:52,272 --> 00:45:54,604
She fought me on this one.

536
00:45:55,108 --> 00:45:57,440
But it is time for a trade.

537
00:45:58,845 --> 00:46:01,006
I'll bet you'll miss the old one.

538
00:46:01,281 --> 00:46:04,273
No, sir, I don't expect
I'll miss it that much.

539
00:46:04,618 --> 00:46:08,281
Come on, you're the only one
who's driven it all this time.

540
00:46:09,089 --> 00:46:10,571
Won't you be a little
sorry to see it go?

541
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:13,682
It ain't going nowhere.
I done bought it.

542
00:46:14,027 --> 00:46:15,027
You didn't.

543
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:18,628
I sure did. Already made the
deal with Mr. Red Mitchell.

544
00:46:18,965 --> 00:46:20,296
How much?

545
00:46:20,634 --> 00:46:23,296
That is for him and me to know.

546
00:46:23,637 --> 00:46:24,797
Hey, Boolie!

547
00:46:25,005 --> 00:46:26,700
Got a gem here.

548
00:46:27,674 --> 00:46:28,674
Got that paper, Hoke?

549
00:46:29,376 --> 00:46:30,536
I got it right here.

550
00:46:30,744 --> 00:46:31,938
Be right there.

551
00:46:32,646 --> 00:46:35,809
Why didn't you buy it from Mama?
Would have saved money.

552
00:46:36,049 --> 00:46:39,485
No, sir. Your mama is in my
business enough as it is.

553
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:42,711
I ain't studying about making
monthly payments to her.

554
00:46:44,324 --> 00:46:45,382
She is mine the regular way.

555
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:47,960
The Hudson's a good car.

556
00:46:47,994 --> 00:46:49,825
Nobody knows that better than you.

557
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:52,391
Best that ever come off the line.

558
00:46:52,666 --> 00:46:57,000
And this here new one, if Miss
Daisy don't take to it...

559
00:46:57,404 --> 00:46:59,838
...l'll let her ride in this one.

560
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,571
Mighty nice of you.

561
00:47:02,676 --> 00:47:04,507
We do what we can.

562
00:48:08,975 --> 00:48:10,806
It is three after seven.

563
00:48:11,144 --> 00:48:14,807
Yes, Ma'am. You said we were
leaving at fifteen to eight.

564
00:48:15,081 --> 00:48:17,072
At the latest, I said.

565
00:48:18,752 --> 00:48:23,246
What business you got dragging this
mess out of the house by yourself?

566
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,151
Who was here to help me?

567
00:48:25,659 --> 00:48:27,251
Lord have mercy!

568
00:48:27,494 --> 00:48:30,657
It don't take more than 5
minutes to load this car.

569
00:48:30,931 --> 00:48:35,425
You're fixing to break your arms and
your legs before we even leave the manor.

570
00:48:35,669 --> 00:48:37,261
You're taking on too much.

571
00:48:37,437 --> 00:48:39,098
I hate doing things at the last minute.

572
00:48:39,439 --> 00:48:43,000
What you talking about?
Been ready to go for a week and a half.

573
00:48:43,276 --> 00:48:45,938
- Give me that package.
- No, don't touch that.

574
00:48:46,112 --> 00:48:49,275
It sure is pretty.
Is that Mr. Walter's present?

575
00:48:49,516 --> 00:48:52,451
Yes. It's fragile.
I'll put it on the seat.

576
00:48:54,287 --> 00:48:55,948
You nearly missed us.

577
00:48:56,189 --> 00:48:57,679
You were leaving at quarter of.

578
00:48:57,958 --> 00:49:00,358
- She's taking on.
- Be still!

579
00:49:01,361 --> 00:49:03,522
Florine bought this for Uncle Walter.

580
00:49:03,964 --> 00:49:05,795
Mama, it's not a snake!

581
00:49:06,032 --> 00:49:07,624
I think it's notepaper.

582
00:49:07,867 --> 00:49:11,030
How appropriate.
Uncle Walter can't see.

583
00:49:11,304 --> 00:49:12,532
Maybe it's soap.

584
00:49:12,706 --> 00:49:16,699
How nice that you take an interest
in your uncle's 90th birthday.

585
00:49:17,844 --> 00:49:19,141
Don't start up with me, mama...

586
00:49:19,279 --> 00:49:21,110
...I can't go
to Mobile with you.

587
00:49:21,247 --> 00:49:22,766
I have to go to New York
for a convention.

588
00:49:22,882 --> 00:49:24,713
The convention starts Monday.

589
00:49:24,985 --> 00:49:26,976
And I know what else I know.

590
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:30,986
Leave Florine out of this.
She ordered those tickets 8 months ago.

591
00:49:31,157 --> 00:49:34,490
I'm sure "My Fair Lady" is more
important than your relatives.

592
00:49:34,995 --> 00:49:37,657
Those Christians will be impressed.

593
00:49:37,998 --> 00:49:40,228
I can't talk to you
when you're like this.

594
00:49:42,402 --> 00:49:45,633
- We're expected in Mobile for supper.
- You'll be there.

595
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:51,171
- How will you stand her all day?
- They'll fix crab. All that trouble.

596
00:49:52,379 --> 00:49:53,869
She's just worked up.

597
00:49:54,047 --> 00:49:56,538
Here's $50 in case you have trouble.

598
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:58,611
Don't show it to Mama!

599
00:49:59,285 --> 00:50:02,550
- Have you got a map?
- She's got it in the back seat.

600
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:05,621
It's 7:16!

601
00:50:06,459 --> 00:50:09,394
You should have a job on the
radio announcing the time.

602
00:50:09,629 --> 00:50:11,722
- I want to miss rush hour.
- You will.

603
00:50:11,898 --> 00:50:15,459
Congratulate Uncle Walter for me
and kiss everybody in Mobile.

604
00:50:16,803 --> 00:50:18,134
The air conditioning...

605
00:50:18,405 --> 00:50:20,566
...did you check it, like I said?

606
00:50:21,141 --> 00:50:23,132
I got the air conditioning checked.

607
00:50:23,476 --> 00:50:26,639
I don't know why.
You never let me turn it on!

608
00:50:26,813 --> 00:50:27,973
Hush up!

609
00:50:33,486 --> 00:50:34,976
Good luck!

610
00:50:35,922 --> 00:50:37,412
Good God!

611
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:58,341
Turn left.

612
00:50:59,512 --> 00:51:01,844
No, right! Turn right!

613
00:51:44,491 --> 00:51:47,824
Did I ever tell you about the
first time I left Georgia?

614
00:51:48,061 --> 00:51:49,392
When was that?

615
00:51:50,163 --> 00:51:51,562
A few minutes back!

616
00:51:51,831 --> 00:51:53,162
Go on!

617
00:51:54,234 --> 00:51:55,394
My daughter...

618
00:51:55,668 --> 00:51:58,159
...is married to a Pullman porter.

619
00:51:58,671 --> 00:52:00,832
She is always on the go.

620
00:52:01,241 --> 00:52:05,075
New York, Detroit, St. Lois.

621
00:52:06,679 --> 00:52:09,580
I say, "That's all well
and good, Tommie Lee...

622
00:52:09,916 --> 00:52:12,407
...but I don't feel the need for it."

623
00:52:13,253 --> 00:52:14,914
So here it is.

624
00:52:15,421 --> 00:52:16,911
The first time.

625
00:52:17,924 --> 00:52:19,915
And I might tell you, Miss Daisy...

626
00:52:20,927 --> 00:52:23,691
...Alabama is not
looking like much so far!

627
00:52:56,629 --> 00:52:59,291
Idella sure does stuff eggs good!

628
00:52:59,566 --> 00:53:01,727
You stuff yourself good.

629
00:53:12,078 --> 00:53:15,411
I was thinking about the
first time I went to Mobile.

630
00:53:16,082 --> 00:53:19,643
It was Walter's wedding: 1888.

631
00:53:19,986 --> 00:53:24,252
1888! You were nothing
but a little bitty thing.

632
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:26,151
I was 12.

633
00:53:26,759 --> 00:53:28,750
We went on the train.

634
00:53:29,095 --> 00:53:31,256
Oh, I was so excited.

635
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:34,829
I'd never been in a wedding party.

636
00:53:35,168 --> 00:53:37,329
I had never seen the ocean.

637
00:53:39,339 --> 00:53:44,174
Papa said it was the Gulf of Mexico, not
the ocean, but it was all the same to me.

638
00:53:47,013 --> 00:53:51,848
I asked Papa if it was all right
for me to dip my hand in the water.

639
00:53:53,186 --> 00:53:56,349
And he laughed because I was so timid.

640
00:53:59,525 --> 00:54:03,188
And then I tasted the
salt water on my fingers.

641
00:54:07,867 --> 00:54:10,700
Isn't that a silly thing to remember?

642
00:54:11,537 --> 00:54:13,732
No sillier than most of
what folks remember.

643
00:54:15,308 --> 00:54:16,468
Boy!

644
00:54:19,212 --> 00:54:21,373
What are you doing with this car?

645
00:54:21,981 --> 00:54:23,642
This is my car, officer.

646
00:54:24,217 --> 00:54:28,813
Can I see your registration,
please, and your license, boy.

647
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:42,665
What's this name? Wertheran?

648
00:54:43,002 --> 00:54:44,162
Werthan.

649
00:54:44,904 --> 00:54:47,236
Never heard that one.
What is it?

650
00:54:47,507 --> 00:54:49,498
It is of German derivation.

651
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:52,071
German derivation.

652
00:55:08,294 --> 00:55:09,522
Thank you, ma'am.

653
00:55:45,631 --> 00:55:49,965
An old nigger and an old Jew woman
riding down the road together.

654
00:55:50,403 --> 00:55:52,564
Now that is one sorry sight.

655
00:56:03,483 --> 00:56:04,643
Oh, my God!

656
00:56:04,984 --> 00:56:07,475
The sign says Phenix City 30 miles.

657
00:56:07,754 --> 00:56:11,246
We're not supposed to go to
Phenix City! Oh, my God!

658
00:56:11,491 --> 00:56:12,822
Maybe you read it wrong.

659
00:56:13,159 --> 00:56:16,993
I didn't. Stop the car. Stop the car!

660
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:19,161
Lord have mercy.

661
00:56:29,175 --> 00:56:33,111
Here. You took the
wrong turn at Opelika.

662
00:56:33,346 --> 00:56:37,009
You took it with me, Miss Daisy.
And you got the map.

663
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:40,342
I was getting the lunch!
Go on back. My God!

664
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:43,783
It aint' more than 30
minutes since we turned.

665
00:57:25,398 --> 00:57:27,559
They fixed crab for me.

666
00:57:28,067 --> 00:57:31,400
Minnie always fixes crab.
They go to so much trouble.

667
00:57:31,671 --> 00:57:33,502
It's all ruined by now.

668
00:57:36,242 --> 00:57:38,233
We going to have to pull over.

669
00:57:38,444 --> 00:57:40,036
What's wrong with the car?

670
00:57:40,413 --> 00:57:42,404
There ain't nothing wrong with the car.

671
00:57:42,682 --> 00:57:44,673
I got to be excused.

672
00:57:46,686 --> 00:57:48,586
I got to go make water.

673
00:57:49,522 --> 00:57:52,252
You should have thought of
that at the service station.

674
00:57:52,525 --> 00:57:57,189
You know colored can't use the toilet
at any service station, Miss Daisy.

675
00:57:57,430 --> 00:58:01,264
There's no time to stop.
We'll be in Mobile soon. You can wait.

676
00:58:07,373 --> 00:58:08,373
No, ma'am.

677
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:14,373
- I told you to wait!
- I heard what you said.

678
00:58:17,049 --> 00:58:21,042
How do you think I feel having to
ask you can I go make water...

679
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:22,881
...like I am some child.

680
00:58:23,556 --> 00:58:24,887
I'd be ashamed.

681
00:58:25,124 --> 00:58:27,285
I ain't no child, Miss Daisy.

682
00:58:27,793 --> 00:58:32,560
And I ain't just a back of the neck you
look at while you go where you got to go.

683
00:58:32,965 --> 00:58:37,402
I am a man. I'm near 70 years old.
And I know when my bladder's full.

684
00:58:39,071 --> 00:58:41,130
Now I'm going to get out of this car...

685
00:58:41,307 --> 00:58:44,140
...and go over there
and do what I got to do.

686
00:58:44,911 --> 00:58:48,904
And I'm taking the key with me, too.
Now that's all there is to it!

687
00:59:15,942 --> 00:59:17,102
Hoke!

688
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:27,519
Hoke!

689
00:59:33,292 --> 00:59:34,292
Hoke?

690
00:59:48,641 --> 00:59:50,370
You all right, Miss Daisy?

691
00:59:51,377 --> 00:59:52,867
Of course I am.

692
00:59:57,283 --> 01:00:01,276
Is that you, Slick? It's Boolie.
How you doing?

693
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,114
Congratulations on your dad's big day.

694
01:00:04,523 --> 01:00:07,492
Thank you, Boolie. Thank you.
Aunt Daisy!

695
01:00:12,531 --> 01:00:14,123
It's Boolie on the phone.

696
01:00:17,803 --> 01:00:19,293
Hey, son!

697
01:00:19,805 --> 01:00:22,365
Uncle Walter appreciates your call.

698
01:00:22,642 --> 01:00:25,042
I don't think he can come to the phone.

699
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:26,972
Fine. How's Hoke?

700
01:00:27,146 --> 01:00:29,137
What do you mean?
How should he be?

701
01:00:30,216 --> 01:00:32,047
Happy birthday, Uncle Walter.

702
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:34,149
I got to hang up now, Boolie.

703
01:00:34,654 --> 01:00:36,144
Yeah, I'll tell him.

704
01:00:38,391 --> 01:00:41,224
For he's a jolly good fellow.

705
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:44,552
Which nobody can deny!

706
01:01:21,934 --> 01:01:23,265
Morning, Miss McClatchey.

707
01:01:24,937 --> 01:01:26,928
Well, good morning to you.

708
01:01:28,874 --> 01:01:29,932
Can I see him?

709
01:01:30,776 --> 01:01:32,767
It's Mr. Sinclair Harris, sir.

710
01:01:33,112 --> 01:01:34,704
My cousin Sinclair?

711
01:01:34,947 --> 01:01:38,610
His wife... The one that talk funny.

712
01:01:38,951 --> 01:01:40,942
She's from Canton, Ohio.

713
01:01:42,288 --> 01:01:43,778
She's trying to hire me.

714
01:01:45,558 --> 01:01:48,049
- What?!
- Yes, sir. She said:

715
01:01:48,294 --> 01:01:50,455
"How they treating you
down there, Hoke?"

716
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:53,563
You know how she sound,
like her nose stuffed up.

717
01:01:53,799 --> 01:01:57,132
So I said, "Fine, Mrs. Harris,
just fine, thank you."

718
01:01:57,403 --> 01:02:01,396
She said, "Well, you looking for
a change, you know who to call."

719
01:02:01,807 --> 01:02:03,468
I'll be damned!

720
01:02:03,809 --> 01:02:06,141
I thought you ought to know about it.

721
01:02:06,746 --> 01:02:08,407
I'll be goddamned.

722
01:02:08,647 --> 01:02:10,308
Ain't she a mess?

723
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:13,582
Said, "Name your own salary."

724
01:02:16,322 --> 01:02:19,655
I see. And did you?

725
01:02:21,494 --> 01:02:22,494
Did I what?

726
01:02:22,762 --> 01:02:26,596
- Name your own salary?
- Go away. What you think I am?

727
01:02:26,832 --> 01:02:30,996
I ain't studying working for
no trashy something like her.

728
01:02:32,338 --> 01:02:35,000
But she got you thinking, didn't she?

729
01:02:35,274 --> 01:02:37,936
Well, sir, you might say that.

730
01:02:40,446 --> 01:02:42,107
Name your salary.

731
01:02:42,782 --> 01:02:44,613
That's exactly what she said.

732
01:02:46,619 --> 01:02:50,111
Well, how does $65 a week sound?

733
01:02:51,624 --> 01:02:53,455
Sounds pretty good, sir.

734
01:02:54,193 --> 01:02:57,685
Course, $75 sounds better.

735
01:02:59,198 --> 01:03:00,790
It sure does!

736
01:03:04,036 --> 01:03:05,526
Beginning this week.

737
01:03:08,541 --> 01:03:10,532
That's mighty nice of you.

738
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:12,971
I sure appreciate this. Thank you.

739
01:03:17,383 --> 01:03:19,374
You ever have folks fighting over you?

740
01:03:20,653 --> 01:03:21,813
No.

741
01:03:23,322 --> 01:03:25,051
It sure feels good.

742
01:03:33,232 --> 01:03:34,563
One dot.

743
01:03:39,905 --> 01:03:41,236
Nine dot.

744
01:03:44,243 --> 01:03:45,243
Two dot.

745
01:03:45,845 --> 01:03:46,903
Mah jongg.

746
01:03:47,246 --> 01:03:49,737
You are the luckiest thing, Beulah!

747
01:03:52,184 --> 01:03:53,184
Excuse me.

748
01:04:06,699 --> 01:04:09,190
I don't know how you can look at that.

749
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:14,032
See it a few times, you get in it.

750
01:04:14,874 --> 01:04:17,707
Both your brains are
fixing to evaporate.

751
01:04:18,944 --> 01:04:20,935
You can bring the cake now, Hoke.

752
01:04:21,714 --> 01:04:23,875
Don't make a mess with those peas.

753
01:04:24,116 --> 01:04:25,777
Do I ever?

754
01:04:26,785 --> 01:04:30,277
Lord have mercy, look at that.
Ain't she got a lot of hair?

755
01:04:30,623 --> 01:04:32,386
How she get it so shiny?

756
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:34,388
Washes it in mayonnaise.

757
01:04:35,227 --> 01:04:38,060
- Go on away from here, Idella!
- Yes, she did.

758
01:04:38,297 --> 01:04:40,288
I read it in Life magazine.

759
01:04:41,967 --> 01:04:43,798
Don't seem human, does it?

760
01:04:44,403 --> 01:04:47,133
He will tear you to shreds!

761
01:04:47,473 --> 01:04:51,136
I am not going into that court.
And I'm not giving in!

762
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:53,901
You are at the end of your rope.

763
01:04:54,146 --> 01:04:56,637
You murdered Carlson.
You have to pay!

764
01:04:56,916 --> 01:05:01,751
Either choose the easy way out,
or you go into the courtroom...

765
01:05:01,987 --> 01:05:04,820
...and let them carve you
into pathetic little bits.

766
01:05:05,157 --> 01:05:07,990
You have a minute to make up your mind.

767
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:14,822
What happened? She up to
something, ain't she?

768
01:06:55,934 --> 01:06:58,767
- You fixing to ruin it.
- What are you talking about?

769
01:06:59,038 --> 01:07:02,872
You got the chicken too close
together and the fire is too high.

770
01:07:03,042 --> 01:07:04,600
Mind your business.

771
01:07:05,444 --> 01:07:07,776
It's your chicken.

772
01:07:29,735 --> 01:07:31,066
Thank you, Hoke.

773
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:33,461
Now you enjoy it.

774
01:07:52,758 --> 01:07:54,089
Amen.

775
01:09:29,922 --> 01:09:31,082
Who is it?

776
01:09:31,356 --> 01:09:33,187
Morning, Miss Daisy.

777
01:09:35,527 --> 01:09:37,688
What in the world...?

778
01:09:39,932 --> 01:09:44,426
I learned how to drive on ice when
I delivered milk for the dairy.

779
01:09:45,037 --> 01:09:46,698
Ain't nothing to it.

780
01:09:47,372 --> 01:09:51,536
Other folks are banging into each
other like they're in the funny papers.

781
01:09:53,378 --> 01:09:57,712
I figured your stove was out, so
I stopped by the Krispy Kreme.

782
01:09:57,916 --> 01:10:00,749
I know you got to have
coffee in the morning.

783
01:10:01,353 --> 01:10:03,344
How sweet of you, Hoke.

784
01:10:05,924 --> 01:10:10,020
We ain't had any good coffee
around here since Idella passed.

785
01:10:10,762 --> 01:10:12,753
I can fix her biscuits.

786
01:10:13,098 --> 01:10:15,589
We both can make her fried chicken.

787
01:10:16,034 --> 01:10:17,763
But nobody can make Idella's coffee.

788
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:20,101
Ain't that the truth?

789
01:10:25,944 --> 01:10:27,775
Idella was lucky.

790
01:10:33,785 --> 01:10:35,616
I expect she was.

791
01:10:50,636 --> 01:10:52,126
Where are you going?

792
01:10:53,071 --> 01:10:55,471
I'm just going to take these things off.

793
01:10:55,974 --> 01:10:59,466
I don't know what you can do here
today, except keep me company.

794
01:11:01,813 --> 01:11:04,145
Then I'll see if I can make us a fire.

795
01:11:06,251 --> 01:11:08,742
Eat anything you want
out of the ice box.

796
01:11:09,254 --> 01:11:11,415
It will all spoil, anyway.

797
01:11:12,658 --> 01:11:16,492
And wipe up what you
tracked onto my floor.

798
01:11:16,762 --> 01:11:19,424
What do you think I am, a mess?

799
01:11:23,001 --> 01:11:24,491
Mama, I'll be right out...

800
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:27,104
...when I can get down my own driveway.

801
01:11:27,339 --> 01:11:30,001
Stay home, Boolie.
Hoke is here with me.

802
01:11:30,275 --> 01:11:31,765
How'd he manage that?

803
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:36,174
He's very handy. I'm fine.
I don't need a thing in the world.

804
01:11:36,448 --> 01:11:40,509
Hello? I have the wrong number.
Mama's saying loving things about Hoke.

805
01:11:41,453 --> 01:11:44,616
I didn't say I love him.
I said he was handy.

806
01:11:45,290 --> 01:11:50,125
Honestly! Are you trying to irritate
me in the middle of an ice storm?

807
01:11:55,701 --> 01:11:57,191
Thank you, Wellborn.

808
01:11:57,869 --> 01:11:59,200
Thank you all.

809
01:12:00,138 --> 01:12:04,131
I am deeply grateful to be
chosen 1966 Man of the Year...

810
01:12:04,376 --> 01:12:06,537
...by the Atlanta Business Council.

811
01:12:06,878 --> 01:12:09,711
An honor I've seen bestowed
on mighty fine fellows.

812
01:12:09,982 --> 01:12:12,644
And one I never expected
would come to me.

813
01:12:13,552 --> 01:12:16,544
I'm afraid that my loss up here...

814
01:12:16,888 --> 01:12:19,049
...and my gain down here...

815
01:12:19,224 --> 01:12:22,557
...have given me an air of
competence that I don't possess.

816
01:12:23,495 --> 01:12:27,659
I will tell you that I wish my father
and grandfather could see this.

817
01:12:27,899 --> 01:12:32,233
About 72 years ago, they leased
an old mill up on Decatur Road...

818
01:12:32,571 --> 01:12:35,233
...with I believe 25 looms in operation.

819
01:12:35,574 --> 01:12:37,735
They managed to grow with Atlanta.

820
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:42,674
And Werthan Industries believes that
what we want is what Atlanta wants.

821
01:12:43,081 --> 01:12:47,074
And this award proves
that we were right.

822
01:12:47,352 --> 01:12:48,683
I thank you.

823
01:13:19,284 --> 01:13:20,444
Well?

824
01:13:21,787 --> 01:13:24,449
What is it? What took you so long?

825
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:29,124
I couldn't help it.
There's a big mess up yonder.

826
01:13:29,394 --> 01:13:33,728
What's the matter? I might as
well not go to temple at all!

827
01:13:33,965 --> 01:13:38,459
No, ma'am, you ain't going to get to
the temple this morning, Miss Daisy.

828
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:41,432
Why not? What's the matter with you?

829
01:13:43,475 --> 01:13:45,739
Somebody has bombed the temple.

830
01:13:46,311 --> 01:13:49,303
What? Bombed the temple?

831
01:13:50,482 --> 01:13:52,814
That's how come
we stuck here so long.

832
01:13:53,085 --> 01:13:54,746
I don't believe it!

833
01:13:55,087 --> 01:13:57,317
That's what the policeman just said.

834
01:14:00,826 --> 01:14:04,819
Oh, my God. Was anybody there?
Were people hurt?

835
01:14:05,097 --> 01:14:07,497
I don't know. He didn't say.

836
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:09,994
Who would do such a thing?

837
01:14:11,002 --> 01:14:15,837
You know good as me, Miss Daisy.
It always be the same ones.

838
01:14:37,696 --> 01:14:40,688
I remember one time back
down there in Macon.

839
01:14:41,032 --> 01:14:45,366
Lord, I couldn't've been more than
10 or 11 years old, I reckon.

840
01:14:45,871 --> 01:14:48,203
I had this friend named Porter.

841
01:14:48,807 --> 01:14:52,470
One day there his daddy
was hanging from a tree.

842
01:14:52,711 --> 01:14:57,148
Now just the day before, we'd
all been pitching horseshoes.

843
01:14:57,482 --> 01:15:01,976
Laughing and carrying on and
talking about how me and Porter...

844
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:05,553
...was going to have strong
right arms, just like him.

845
01:15:06,725 --> 01:15:10,661
Lord, there he was.
Hanging up yonder in the tree.

846
01:15:10,896 --> 01:15:15,390
Had his hand tied behind him.
Flies was all over him.

847
01:15:15,901 --> 01:15:19,064
I tell you, I threw up
where I was standing.

848
01:15:21,239 --> 01:15:22,831
You go on and cry.

849
01:15:24,676 --> 01:15:26,234
I'm not crying.

850
01:15:28,513 --> 01:15:30,504
Why did you tell me that story?

851
01:15:31,416 --> 01:15:33,748
Lord, I don't know, Miss Daisy.

852
01:15:34,085 --> 01:15:37,418
That mess back there
put me in mind of it.

853
01:15:37,689 --> 01:15:40,749
Ridiculous! The temple
has nothing to do with it!

854
01:15:41,026 --> 01:15:42,516
Yes, ma'am, if you say so.

855
01:15:42,761 --> 01:15:46,720
We don't know. Maybe that
policeman wasn't telling the truth.

856
01:15:46,932 --> 01:15:50,265
Why would he go and lie
about a thing like that?

857
01:15:50,702 --> 01:15:52,533
You never get things right!

858
01:15:52,704 --> 01:15:56,367
Miss Daisy, somebody done bombed
that temple and you know it!

859
01:15:56,575 --> 01:15:58,975
I don't want to hear anymore about it!

860
01:16:01,279 --> 01:16:04,271
- You the boss.
- Don't talk to me!

861
01:16:25,804 --> 01:16:28,466
- Where are you?
- Up here!

862
01:16:37,649 --> 01:16:40,311
Hello, Mama. How are you feeling?

863
01:16:40,652 --> 01:16:44,144
Not a good question to
ask somebody nearly 90!

864
01:16:44,656 --> 01:16:46,317
Well, you look fine.

865
01:16:46,591 --> 01:16:48,821
It's my ageless appeal!

866
01:16:50,495 --> 01:16:52,588
Miss McClatchey gave me your message.

867
01:16:52,831 --> 01:16:54,822
Florine is invited, too.

868
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:56,166
Thank you.

869
01:16:56,434 --> 01:16:59,767
I guess Hoke should drive us.
There'll be a crowd.

870
01:17:00,438 --> 01:17:02,668
Mama, we have to talk about this.

871
01:17:02,941 --> 01:17:04,431
About what?

872
01:17:04,676 --> 01:17:06,837
About the feasibility of all this.

873
01:17:07,112 --> 01:17:11,105
I believe Martin Luther King has
done some mighty fine things.

874
01:17:11,449 --> 01:17:14,941
If you don't want to go,
why don't you just say so?

875
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:18,283
I want to go! You know
how I feel about him.

876
01:17:18,456 --> 01:17:20,117
Of course, but Florine...

877
01:17:20,358 --> 01:17:24,351
Florine has nothing to do with it.
I still have to do business here.

878
01:17:24,629 --> 01:17:29,464
I see. Werthan Bag will go out of
business if you attend the King dinner.

879
01:17:29,701 --> 01:17:34,638
Not exactly. But a lot of men I do
business with would not like it!

880
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,371
They might...

881
01:17:37,375 --> 01:17:39,036
...snicker a little.

882
01:17:40,145 --> 01:17:43,308
Call me Martin Luther
Werthan behind my back.

883
01:17:46,651 --> 01:17:49,984
Maybe I wouldn't hear
about meetings at the Club.

884
01:17:50,555 --> 01:17:55,219
Old Jack Raphael at Ideal Mills, he's a
New York Jew instead of a Georgia Jew.

885
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:58,823
All the really smart ones come
from New York, don't they?

886
01:17:59,397 --> 01:18:04,164
Some might throw their business to Jack
instead of old Martin Luther Werthan.

887
01:18:05,503 --> 01:18:08,904
I don't know.
Maybe it wouldn't happen.

888
01:18:09,507 --> 01:18:12,169
And sometimes that's
the way things work.

889
01:18:13,511 --> 01:18:17,174
Anyway, if we don't use those
seats, somebody else will.

890
01:18:17,582 --> 01:18:21,348
If we do not use those seats?
I'm not supposed to go, either?

891
01:18:21,686 --> 01:18:23,347
You can do whatever you want.

892
01:18:23,588 --> 01:18:25,579
Thanks for your permission.

893
01:18:26,424 --> 01:18:28,016
Can I ask you something?

894
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:33,195
When did you get so fired up about
Martin Luther King?

895
01:18:33,531 --> 01:18:34,691
Why, Boolie!

896
01:18:34,933 --> 01:18:38,425
I've never been prejudiced
in my life and you know it.

897
01:18:39,938 --> 01:18:42,099
Then ask Hoke to go with you.

898
01:18:42,941 --> 01:18:45,102
Don't be ridiculous. He wouldn't go.

899
01:18:46,778 --> 01:18:48,370
Ask him and see.

900
01:19:04,129 --> 01:19:05,460
All right!

901
01:19:47,572 --> 01:19:50,564
Boolie said the silliest
thing the other day.

902
01:19:53,645 --> 01:19:55,010
What did he say?

903
01:19:55,513 --> 01:19:58,141
He was talking about Martin Luther Ling.

904
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:00,809
I guess you know him, don't you?

905
01:20:01,019 --> 01:20:03,317
King? No, ma'am.
I don't know him.

906
01:20:03,655 --> 01:20:05,520
I was sure you did.

907
01:20:05,824 --> 01:20:07,519
But you've heard him preach?

908
01:20:07,759 --> 01:20:12,253
Yes, Ma'am, same way you have.
On the TV.

909
01:20:12,831 --> 01:20:14,822
I think he's wonderful.

910
01:20:20,171 --> 01:20:23,038
- What you getting at?
- It's so silly.

911
01:20:23,274 --> 01:20:27,836
Boolie says you wanted to go with me
to this dinner. Did you tell him that?

912
01:20:28,613 --> 01:20:29,613
No, I didn't.

913
01:20:29,781 --> 01:20:34,548
I didn't think so. What'd be the point?
You can hear him whenever you want.

914
01:20:36,054 --> 01:20:39,353
I think it's wonderful the
way things are changing.

915
01:20:59,477 --> 01:21:02,640
Now what you think
I am, Miss Daisy?

916
01:21:02,814 --> 01:21:03,940
What do you mean?

917
01:21:04,148 --> 01:21:05,979
The invitation to this dinner...

918
01:21:06,084 --> 01:21:07,813
...came in the mail a month ago.

919
01:21:08,152 --> 01:21:11,986
Now, if did be you wanted
me to go with you...

920
01:21:12,323 --> 01:21:16,316
...how come you wait 'till we in the
car on the way before you asked me?

921
01:21:16,494 --> 01:21:20,487
What? All I said was Boolie
said you wanted to go.

922
01:21:21,232 --> 01:21:25,225
Next time you want me to go
somewhere ask me regular.

923
01:21:25,503 --> 01:21:27,494
You don't have to carry on so much.

924
01:21:27,739 --> 01:21:30,003
Let's just leave it alone.

925
01:21:30,341 --> 01:21:31,501
Honestly!

926
01:21:35,747 --> 01:21:39,740
Talk about things changing.
They ain't changed all that much.

927
01:21:47,125 --> 01:21:48,422
I'll help you.

928
01:21:48,693 --> 01:21:51,685
Thank you, Hoke, I can help myself.

929
01:22:00,939 --> 01:22:04,272
...can see that the South
has marvelous possibilities.

930
01:22:05,443 --> 01:22:07,877
Yet in spite of these assets...

931
01:22:08,212 --> 01:22:10,703
...segregation has placed the South...

932
01:22:10,949 --> 01:22:15,784
...socially, educationally, and
economically behind the rest of the nation.

933
01:22:16,454 --> 01:22:21,153
Yet there are in the white South
millions of people of good will...

934
01:22:21,659 --> 01:22:24,457
...whose voices are yet unheard...

935
01:22:25,163 --> 01:22:27,791
...whose course is yet unclear...

936
01:22:28,466 --> 01:22:31,458
...and whose courageous
acts are yet unseen.

937
01:22:32,170 --> 01:22:34,968
These millions are called upon...

938
01:22:35,573 --> 01:22:38,736
...to gird their courage,
to speak out...

939
01:22:39,410 --> 01:22:42,243
...to offer leadership that is needed.

940
01:22:42,313 --> 01:22:44,474
History will have to record...

941
01:22:44,749 --> 01:22:48,241
...that the greatest tragedy of
this period of social transition...

942
01:22:48,586 --> 01:22:53,421
...was not the vitriolic words and the
violent actions of the bad people...

943
01:22:53,992 --> 01:22:58,486
...but the appalling silence and
indifference of the good people.

944
01:22:58,830 --> 01:23:01,196
And our generation
will have to repent...

945
01:23:01,432 --> 01:23:04,924
...not only for the words and acts
of the children of darkness...

946
01:23:05,269 --> 01:23:10,104
...but also for the fears and
apathy of the children of light.

947
01:23:38,236 --> 01:23:40,033
Morning, Miss Daisy.

948
01:24:10,535 --> 01:24:11,535
Miss Daisy?

949
01:24:16,674 --> 01:24:18,835
Hoke, is that Hoke?

950
01:24:19,277 --> 01:24:21,404
It's me. You all right?

951
01:24:22,413 --> 01:24:25,507
Hoke, what did I do with my papers?

952
01:24:26,084 --> 01:24:29,576
My papers! I had them all
corrected last night...

953
01:24:30,021 --> 01:24:33,354
...and I put them where I wouldn't
forget them on my way to school.

954
01:24:33,591 --> 01:24:34,785
What did you do with them?

955
01:24:34,926 --> 01:24:36,587
What are you talking about?

956
01:24:36,861 --> 01:24:40,695
The children will be disappointed if
I don't give them their homework.

957
01:24:40,932 --> 01:24:43,924
I always give it back the next day.

958
01:24:44,302 --> 01:24:45,929
That's why they like me.

959
01:24:46,104 --> 01:24:47,594
You talking out your head.

960
01:24:47,805 --> 01:24:49,602
Why aren't you helping me?

961
01:24:50,108 --> 01:24:51,700
What'll I do?

962
01:24:51,943 --> 01:24:54,309
Find those papers. I told you.

963
01:24:55,713 --> 01:24:58,876
It's all right if you moved them.
I won't be mad.

964
01:24:59,117 --> 01:25:02,314
But I've got to get to school.
I'll be late.

965
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:07,319
Who will take care of my class?
They'll be all alone. Oh, God!

966
01:25:07,558 --> 01:25:09,219
I do everything wrong!

967
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:13,123
Now set down in here. You're
going to fall and hurt yourself.

968
01:25:14,232 --> 01:25:18,726
I'm so sorry. It's all my fault.
I didn't do right.

969
01:25:20,138 --> 01:25:21,628
It's so awful!

970
01:25:21,906 --> 01:25:25,069
Ain't nothing awful except
the way you carrying on.

971
01:25:25,243 --> 01:25:26,904
It's all my fault.

972
01:25:27,145 --> 01:25:29,841
I can't find the papers.
The children are waiting.

973
01:25:30,081 --> 01:25:33,414
There ain't nobody waiting on you.
You ain't a teacher.

974
01:25:33,651 --> 01:25:35,642
It doesn't make any difference.

975
01:25:35,987 --> 01:25:38,922
Now listen, there ain't
nothing wrong with you!

976
01:25:39,157 --> 01:25:40,351
You don't know.

977
01:25:57,141 --> 01:25:58,472
This Hoke here.

978
01:25:59,477 --> 01:26:00,307
What can I do for you?

979
01:26:00,378 --> 01:26:01,675
It's your mama.

980
01:26:01,879 --> 01:26:02,937
What's wrong?

981
01:26:03,181 --> 01:26:05,012
She's taking on something awful.

982
01:26:05,616 --> 01:26:07,880
Why's today different
from any other day?

983
01:26:08,519 --> 01:26:10,384
No, sir. It's not the same.

984
01:26:12,089 --> 01:26:13,579
I'll be right there.

985
01:26:17,528 --> 01:26:21,521
Miss Daisy, now there ain't
nothing wrong with you!

986
01:26:21,899 --> 01:26:24,390
Your mind done took a turn this morning.

987
01:26:24,635 --> 01:26:27,035
You'll snap back if you let yourself.

988
01:26:27,305 --> 01:26:29,466
I can't! I can't!

989
01:26:30,308 --> 01:26:32,208
You're a lucky old woman.

990
01:26:32,410 --> 01:26:36,904
No! It's all a mess now, and
I can't do anything about it.

991
01:26:37,215 --> 01:26:41,208
Now look at you. You rich,
you well for your time.

992
01:26:41,652 --> 01:26:44,485
You got folks who care
what happens to you.

993
01:26:44,722 --> 01:26:48,214
I am being trouble. I don't
want to be trouble to anybody.

994
01:26:48,492 --> 01:26:51,825
You want something to cry about,
I'll run you to the state home...

995
01:26:52,063 --> 01:26:54,429
...let you see what's laying out there.

996
01:26:54,732 --> 01:26:58,498
I bet there ain't one of them
carrying on the way you doing.

997
01:26:58,736 --> 01:27:01,933
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Those poor children.

998
01:27:02,506 --> 01:27:07,068
You keep this up and Mr. Werthan's
going to call that doctor on you.

999
01:27:07,178 --> 01:27:12,081
Just as sure as you born, that doctor is
going to have you out in that asylum.

1000
01:27:12,583 --> 01:27:15,575
Now is that the way you want it to be?

1001
01:27:23,027 --> 01:27:25,359
Do you still have that Hudson?

1002
01:27:27,365 --> 01:27:30,266
You talking about from
when I first come here?

1003
01:27:31,769 --> 01:27:33,100
No, Miss Daisy.

1004
01:27:33,371 --> 01:27:38,035
That thing been in the junkyard now...
more than 15 years.

1005
01:27:38,709 --> 01:27:42,543
I'm driving your next to last car now.

1006
01:27:43,047 --> 01:27:45,379
1965 Cadillac.

1007
01:27:45,716 --> 01:27:48,207
It's running fine as wine, too.

1008
01:27:50,388 --> 01:27:54,381
You ought not to be driving
anything the way you see.

1009
01:27:54,692 --> 01:27:59,527
Now, how you know how I can see
'less'n you can look out my eyes.

1010
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:10,300
You're my best friend.

1011
01:28:10,508 --> 01:28:12,999
- Go on now, Miss Daisy.
- No, really.

1012
01:28:13,744 --> 01:28:15,075
You are.

1013
01:28:20,251 --> 01:28:21,582
You are.

1014
01:30:12,129 --> 01:30:14,290
Well, Hoke, good to see you!

1015
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:19,634
- You didn't drive yourself here?
- No, sir. I don't drive now.

1016
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:21,804
My granddaughter drove me.

1017
01:30:22,039 --> 01:30:24,530
My Lord, is she old enough to drive?

1018
01:30:24,875 --> 01:30:27,810
Michelle is nigh on 37 years old now.

1019
01:30:28,312 --> 01:30:32,476
She's teaching biology at
yonder Spelman College.

1020
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:34,047
I never knew that.

1021
01:30:39,824 --> 01:30:44,158
Seems mighty funny to sell the
house while Mama's still alive.

1022
01:30:44,662 --> 01:30:47,153
Yes, sir, I imagine it do.

1023
01:30:47,998 --> 01:30:51,490
But she hasn't been inside
the door for two years.

1024
01:30:51,902 --> 01:30:53,267
I know.

1025
01:30:54,171 --> 01:30:56,662
I suppose you don't see her very much.

1026
01:30:56,907 --> 01:30:58,898
No, sir, I don't.

1027
01:30:59,577 --> 01:31:02,910
It's hard, not driving, Mr. Werthan.

1028
01:31:03,347 --> 01:31:06,077
There's no bus that goes out yonder.

1029
01:31:06,417 --> 01:31:10,786
Course, I take a taxicab
as often as I can.

1030
01:31:11,355 --> 01:31:13,016
I' m sure she appreciates it.

1031
01:31:15,526 --> 01:31:18,859
Some days she's better than others.

1032
01:31:20,698 --> 01:31:22,859
But then, who ain't?

1033
01:32:08,412 --> 01:32:10,073
Happy Thanksgiving, Mama!

1034
01:32:11,415 --> 01:32:13,076
Look who I brought!

1035
01:32:14,151 --> 01:32:15,982
Morning, Miss Daisy.

1036
01:32:17,922 --> 01:32:20,413
You been keeping yourself busy?

1037
01:32:22,092 --> 01:32:25,425
She certainly has.
She goes to jewelry making...

1038
01:32:25,663 --> 01:32:27,358
How many times a week?

1039
01:32:28,165 --> 01:32:30,861
She makes all kinds of things.
Pins, bracelets...

1040
01:32:31,769 --> 01:32:33,259
She's a regular Tiffany's.

1041
01:32:33,504 --> 01:32:35,369
Isn't that something!

1042
01:32:40,611 --> 01:32:42,272
Are you all right, Mama?

1043
01:32:47,284 --> 01:32:50,117
Hoke, I thought of you the other day.

1044
01:32:51,288 --> 01:32:54,018
- I saw an Avondale milk truck.
- Is that right?

1045
01:32:54,291 --> 01:32:57,692
A big monster of a thing.
Must've had about 16 wheels.

1046
01:32:57,962 --> 01:32:59,452
Go on away from here.

1047
01:32:59,697 --> 01:33:02,894
I wondered how you'd have
liked driving that around.

1048
01:33:04,134 --> 01:33:06,967
Hoke came to see me, not you.

1049
01:33:09,506 --> 01:33:11,667
This is one of her good days.

1050
01:33:13,043 --> 01:33:17,980
Mama, Florine said to wish you a happy
Thanksgiving. She's in Washington.

1051
01:33:19,316 --> 01:33:22,308
She's a Republican National
Committeewoman now.

1052
01:33:22,653 --> 01:33:24,052
Good God!

1053
01:33:30,995 --> 01:33:33,327
Go charm the nurses!

1054
01:33:36,667 --> 01:33:38,828
She wants you all to herself.

1055
01:33:40,337 --> 01:33:41,929
You are a doodle, Mama.

1056
01:34:02,026 --> 01:34:04,017
Boolie paying you still?

1057
01:34:05,362 --> 01:34:06,693
Every week.

1058
01:34:06,864 --> 01:34:08,195
How much?

1059
01:34:08,465 --> 01:34:11,263
Now that's between him and me.

1060
01:34:11,869 --> 01:34:13,860
Highway robbery!

1061
01:34:16,707 --> 01:34:18,368
It sure is.

1062
01:34:21,612 --> 01:34:23,273
It sure is.

1063
01:34:27,384 --> 01:34:28,874
How are you?

1064
01:34:31,889 --> 01:34:34,050
I'm doing the best I can.

1065
01:34:36,493 --> 01:34:37,790
Me, too.

1066
01:34:40,497 --> 01:34:44,297
Well, that's about all
there is to it then.

1067
01:34:53,744 --> 01:34:55,075
Look it here.

1068
01:34:55,913 --> 01:34:58,905
You didn't eat your Thanksgiving pie.

1069
01:35:02,319 --> 01:35:03,650
Go on now.

1070
01:35:06,924 --> 01:35:09,085
Here, let me help you.

1071
01:35:25,275 --> 01:35:26,435
Is it good?

1072
01:35:32,116 --> 01:35:33,777
Here comes some more.
