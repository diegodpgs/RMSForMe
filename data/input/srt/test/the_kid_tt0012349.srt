2
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:12,573
A picture with a smile -
and perhaps, a tear.

3
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,289
"Charity Hospital"

4
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:31,175
The Woman -
whose sin was motherhood.

5
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,550
Alone.

6
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,890
The man.

7
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,489
His morning promenade.

8
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,053
"Awkward ass."

9
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,286
"Pardon me, you dropped something."

10
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:05,295
"Is that yours?"

11
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,824
"What its name?"

12
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,944
"John"

13
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:47,765
Five years later...

14
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:42,865
"Put the quater in the gas meter."

15
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:53,977
"You know what streets we worked today?"

16
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,815
All's well...Job number 13.

17
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,185
Off duty.

18
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:02,796
The woman -
now a star of great prominence.

19
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:20,772
Professor Guido, impressario.

20
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:36,204
"Read what the critics say... wonderful!"

21
00:21:53,948 --> 00:21:59,329
Charity -
to some a duty, to others a joy.

22
00:27:18,465 --> 00:27:21,008
Enter - his brother.

23
00:27:41,654 --> 00:27:43,448
" You wicked boy."

24
00:27:51,998 --> 00:27:53,666
"Go lick'im."

25
00:28:02,175 --> 00:28:07,889
"If your kid beats my brother,
then i'm going to beat you."

26
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:30,054
"And you wouldn't strike this man,
would you?"

27
00:29:58,349 --> 00:30:01,394
"Remember - if he smites you
on one cheek,...

28
00:30:01,502 --> 00:30:03,880
...offer him the other."

29
00:30:30,965 --> 00:30:33,467
A successful retreat.

30
00:30:57,549 --> 00:31:01,011
"Oh, well, I guess he's not in.".

31
00:31:17,611 --> 00:31:21,657
"This child is ill. Get a doctor at once!"

32
00:31:27,746 --> 00:31:31,500
"I must go now, but I'll return."

33
00:31:39,928 --> 00:31:43,555
The country doctor.

34
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,422
"Say 'ah'."

35
00:32:39,068 --> 00:32:40,360
"Louder!"

36
00:33:05,511 --> 00:33:09,264
"Are you the father of this child?"

37
00:33:11,308 --> 00:33:13,018
"Well - pràctically."

38
00:33:15,729 --> 00:33:17,815
"Explain yourself."

39
00:33:56,186 --> 00:33:59,940
"This child needs proper care and attention."

40
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,284
"I'll attend to the matter."

41

Country Orfan Asylum

44
00:35:31,573 --> 00:35:34,952
"Ask him where the kid is."

45
00:35:39,498 --> 00:35:44,545
"Ask him if he's got any belongings."

46
00:35:46,797 --> 00:35:50,259
" Tell him it's none of his business."

47
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:20,195
Night.

48
00:42:31,577 --> 00:42:35,956
"You don't charge for a baby in arms?"

49
00:43:02,274 --> 00:43:05,486
<i>$1000 Reward
Lost child wanted...</i>

50
00:45:30,982 --> 00:45:33,176
Dawn.

51
00:47:06,977 --> 00:47:08,979
Dreamland.

52
00:48:11,792 --> 00:48:14,044
Shopping.

53
00:48:34,189 --> 00:48:36,275
Off for a spin.

54
00:48:45,868 --> 00:48:47,661
Sin creeps in.

55
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:51,957
<i>Welcome to our city.</i>

56
00:49:02,593 --> 00:49:04,762
The trouble begins.

57
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:11,977
"Vamp him."

58
00:49:21,653 --> 00:49:23,238
Innocence.

59
00:49:44,635 --> 00:49:46,512
Getting flighty.

60
00:49:52,643 --> 00:49:55,062
Her sweetheart arrives.

61
00:50:18,585 --> 00:50:20,587
Jealousy.
