00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,454
<i>RENTON: Choose life.
Choose a job.

2
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:36,998
<i>Choose a career.
Choose a family.

3
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:38,667
<i>Choose a fucking
big television.

4
00:00:38,792 --> 00:00:41,253
<i>Choose washing machines, cars,
compact-disc players,

5
00:00:41,336 --> 00:00:43,130
<i>and electrical tin openers.

6
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:55,809
<i>Choose good health,
low cholesterol,

7
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:57,227
<i>and dental insurance.

8
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,604
<i>Choose fixed-interest
mortgage repayments.

9
00:00:59,688 --> 00:01:02,607
<i>Choose a starter home.
Choose your friends.

10
00:01:04,443 --> 00:01:06,236
<i>Choose leisurewear
and matching luggage.

11
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:08,113
<i>Choose a three-piece suite
on hire purchase

12
00:01:08,238 --> 00:01:10,031
<i>in a range of fucking fabrics.

13
00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:13,285
<i>Choose D.I.Y. and wondering who
you are on a Sunday morning.

14
00:01:13,368 --> 00:01:15,328
<i>Choose sitting,
watching mind-numbing,

15
00:01:15,412 --> 00:01:16,997
<i>spirit-crushing game shows,

16
00:01:17,122 --> 00:01:19,916
<i>stuffing fucking junk food
into your mouth.

17
00:01:27,507 --> 00:01:28,633
Tommy, go!

18
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:30,552
<i>Choose rotting away
at the end of it,

19
00:01:30,677 --> 00:01:32,304
<i>pissing your last
in a miserable home.

20
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:34,306
<i>An embarrassment
to the selfish,

21
00:01:34,389 --> 00:01:37,142
<i>fucked-up brats that you've
spawned to replace yourself.

22
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:39,978
<i>Choose your future.
Choose life.

23
00:01:40,062 --> 00:01:44,316
<i># Here comes Johnny Yen again #

24
00:01:44,441 --> 00:01:46,151
<i># With the liquor and drugs #

25
00:01:46,276 --> 00:01:48,820
<i>But why would I want to do
a thing like that?

26
00:01:49,488 --> 00:01:53,450
<i># He's gonna do
another striptease #

27
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:55,535
<i>I chose not to choose life.

28
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,496
<i>I chose something else.

29
00:01:57,579 --> 00:01:59,122
<i>And the reasons?

30
00:02:00,082 --> 00:02:02,042
<i>There are no reasons.

31
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:05,003
<i>Who needs reasons
when you've got heroin?

32
00:02:05,712 --> 00:02:08,006
<i># Yeah, something called love #

33
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:12,344
<i># Well, that's like
hypnotizing chickens #

34
00:02:15,847 --> 00:02:18,392
"Goldfinger's"
better than "Dr. No."

35
00:02:19,976 --> 00:02:23,230
Both of them are a lot better
than "Diamonds Are Forever."

36
00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:26,066
A judgment reflected
in its relatively poor showing

37
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:27,818
at the box office.

38
00:02:29,027 --> 00:02:30,570
In which field, of course,

39
00:02:30,695 --> 00:02:35,283
"Thunderball"
was a notable success.

40
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:37,911
<i>People think it's all
about misery and desperation

41
00:02:38,036 --> 00:02:40,872
<i>and death and all that shite,
which is not to be ignored.

42
00:02:40,956 --> 00:02:44,000
Fuck off!
Doss cunt!

43
00:02:44,835 --> 00:02:48,755
<i>But what they forget
is the pleasure of it.

44
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,466
Wild hands like me!

45
00:02:52,717 --> 00:02:54,469
You prick!

46
00:02:55,887 --> 00:02:58,557
<i>Otherwise we wouldn't do it.

47
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,101
- Do you want me to do it?
- Yeah.

48
00:03:01,226 --> 00:03:04,187
Beaut as the driven snow,
that shit, Danny.

49
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:10,610
<i>After all,
we're not fucking stupid.

50
00:03:10,736 --> 00:03:13,321
<i>Well, at least, we're not
that fucking stupid.

51
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:27,919
<i>Take the best orgasm
you ever had,

52
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:32,340
<i>multiply it by 1, 000, and
you're still nowhere near it.

53
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:35,719
That beats any meat injection.

54
00:03:38,096 --> 00:03:42,184
That beats any fucking cock
in the world.

55
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:45,604
<i>When you're on junk, you have
only one worry. Scoring.

56
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:49,649
<i>When you're off it, you worry
about all sorts of other shite.

57
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:51,234
<i>Got no money.
Can't get drunk.

58
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:52,778
<i>Got money.
Drinking too much.

59
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:54,529
<i>Can't get a girl.
No chance of a ride.

60
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:56,782
<i>Got a girl.
Too much hassle.

61
00:03:56,907 --> 00:03:59,117
<i>You have to worry about bills,
about food,

62
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:01,244
<i>about some football team
that never wins,

63
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:02,913
<i>about human relationships

64
00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:04,998
<i>and all of the things
that don't matter

65
00:04:05,082 --> 00:04:08,919
<i>when you've got a sincere
and truthful junk habit.

66
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:13,757
I'd say, in those days,
he was a muscular actor.

67
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:18,345
With all the presence of someone
like Cooper or Lancaster,

68
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,181
but combined with a sly wit...

69
00:04:22,474 --> 00:04:25,477
...to make him a formidable
romantic lead.

70
00:04:26,186 --> 00:04:29,314
Closer in that respect
to Cary Grant.

71
00:04:29,856 --> 00:04:31,316
Aah.

72
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:37,280
<i># Hey, man,
where'd ya get that lotion? #

73
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:41,952
<i># Your skin starts itching
once you buy the gimmick #

74
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:44,413
<i># About something called love #

75
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:45,997
<i># Love, love, love #

76
00:04:46,123 --> 00:04:49,709
<i># Well, that's like
hypnotizing chickens #

77
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:53,338
<i>The only drawback, or at least
the principal drawback,

78
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:56,049
<i>is that you have to endure
cunts telling you...

79
00:04:56,174 --> 00:04:59,594
"No way would I poison my body
with that shite."

80
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:03,014
All the fucking chemicals.

81
00:05:04,516 --> 00:05:06,476
No fucking way.

82
00:05:08,603 --> 00:05:10,188
It's a waste of your life, Mark,

83
00:05:10,272 --> 00:05:12,691
poisoning your body
with that shite.

84
00:05:12,774 --> 00:05:16,445
Every chance you've had, son,
you've blown it.

85
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,072
Stuffing your veins
with that filth.

86
00:05:19,197 --> 00:05:22,534
<i>From time to time, even I
have uttered the magic words.

87
00:05:27,497 --> 00:05:29,875
Never again, Swanney.
I'm off the scag.

88
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:30,876
Are you serious?

89
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,045
Yeah. No more.
I'm finished with that shite.

90
00:05:34,171 --> 00:05:35,088
It's up to you.

91
00:05:35,172 --> 00:05:37,758
I'm going to get it sorted out,
get off it for good.

92
00:05:37,883 --> 00:05:39,885
I sure have heard
that one before.

93
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,720
The Sick Boy method.

94
00:05:41,845 --> 00:05:43,847
Well, it really worked
for him, eh?

95
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,849
He's always been lacking
in moral fiber.

96
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:47,225
He knows a lot
about Sean Connery.

97
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,561
That's hardly a substitute.

98
00:05:49,644 --> 00:05:51,480
You need one more hit.

99
00:05:51,605 --> 00:05:52,647
No, I don't think so.

100
00:05:52,773 --> 00:05:54,983
For the long night
that lies ahead.

101
00:05:56,777 --> 00:05:58,195
<i>We called him Mother Superior

102
00:05:58,278 --> 00:06:00,405
<i>on account of the length
of his habit.

103
00:06:00,489 --> 00:06:02,491
<i>Of course
I'd have another shot.

104
00:06:02,616 --> 00:06:04,117
<i>After all, I had work to do.

105
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,054
<i>Relinquishing junk, stage one.
Preparation.

106
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:31,269
<i>For this you will need one
room, which you will not leave.

107
00:06:31,395 --> 00:06:35,315
<i>Soothing music.
Tomato soup, 10 tins of.

108
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,195
<i>Mushroom soup, 8 tins of
for consumption cold.

109
00:06:40,904 --> 00:06:43,573
<i>Ice cream, vanilla,
one large tub of.

110
00:06:43,657 --> 00:06:45,700
<i>Magnesia, milk of, one bottle.

111
00:06:45,826 --> 00:06:48,161
<i>Paracetamol,
mouthwash, vitamins,

112
00:06:48,286 --> 00:06:52,624
<i>mineral water,
Lucozade, pornography.

113
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,001
<i>One mattress.

114
00:06:55,085 --> 00:06:59,047
<i>One bucket for urine, one
for feces, and one for vomitus.

115
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:01,508
<i>One television.

116
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:04,261
<i>One bottle of Valium, which
I procured from my mother,

117
00:07:04,344 --> 00:07:07,597
<i>who is, in her own domestic
and socially acceptable way,

118
00:07:07,681 --> 00:07:09,641
<i>also a drug addict.

119
00:07:13,145 --> 00:07:14,855
<i>And now I'm ready.

120
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,481
<i>All I need is one final hit

121
00:07:16,606 --> 00:07:20,360
<i>to soothe the pain while
the Valium takes effect.

122
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:25,574
Mikey. Hi.
Yeah, it's Mark Renton.

123
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:28,201
Look, could you help me out?

124
00:07:28,326 --> 00:07:31,121
<i>This was typical
of Mikey Forrester.

125
00:07:31,663 --> 00:07:33,999
What the fuck are these?

126
00:07:34,082 --> 00:07:35,125
<i>Under the normal run of things

127
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,376
<i>I would have had nothing to do
with the cunt,

128
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:38,545
<i>but this was not
the normal run of things.

129
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,214
Opium suppositories.

130
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:43,216
Ideal for your purposes.

131
00:07:43,341 --> 00:07:47,179
Slow release.
Bring you down gradually.

132
00:07:48,221 --> 00:07:50,265
Custom-fucking-designed
for your needs.

133
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,850
I want a fucking hit!

134
00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:53,351
That's all I've got, man.

135
00:07:53,435 --> 00:07:55,228
Take it or leave it.

136
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:08,158
Are you feeling better now?

137
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:09,785
For all the good
they've done me,

138
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,579
I might as well have
stuck them up my arse.

139
00:08:14,706 --> 00:08:16,792
<i>Heroin makes you constipated.

140
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:19,002
<i>The heroin from my last hit
is fading away.

141

<i>The suppositories
have yet to melt.

142
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:23,173
Ohh!

143
00:08:23,965 --> 00:08:26,093
<i>I'm no longer constipated.

144
00:08:34,101 --> 00:08:37,521
<i>I fantasize about massive
pristine convenience.

145
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:41,191
<i>Brilliant gold taps,
virginal-white marble,

146
00:08:41,274 --> 00:08:44,611
<i>a seat carved from ebony,
a cistern full of Chanel No. 5,

147
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:48,907
<i>and a flunky handing me
pieces of raw silk toilet roll.

148
00:08:49,032 --> 00:08:52,411
<i>But under the circumstances,
I'll settle for anywhere.

149
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:05,882
Ohh.

150
00:09:12,973 --> 00:09:14,516
Fuck.

151
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:16,601
Ohh! Oh!

152
00:09:20,564 --> 00:09:21,523
Ahh.

153
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:50,153
Yes, a fucking Godsend!

154
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:29,651
<i>And now.

155
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:31,445
<i>Now I'm ready.

156
00:11:32,946 --> 00:11:34,239
<i>The downside of coming off junk

157
00:11:34,322 --> 00:11:36,283
<i>was I knew I would mix
with my friends

158
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:38,326
<i>in a state of full
consciousness.

159
00:11:38,452 --> 00:11:39,745
<i>It was awful.

160
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,288
<i>They reminded me of myself.

161
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:43,123
<i>I could hardly bear
to look at them.

162
00:11:43,248 --> 00:11:44,833
<i>Take Sick Boy, for instance.

163
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,626
<i>He came off junk
at the same time.

164
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:48,545
<i>Not because he wanted to.

165
00:11:48,628 --> 00:11:49,629
<i>Just to annoy me.

166
00:11:49,713 --> 00:11:51,757
<i>Just to show me
how easily he could do it,

167
00:11:51,882 --> 00:11:54,301
<i>thereby downgrading
my own struggle.

168
00:11:54,384 --> 00:11:56,428
<i>Sneaky fucker, don't you think?

169
00:11:56,511 --> 00:11:59,598
<i>When I wanted to lie there
and feel sorry for myself,

170
00:11:59,723 --> 00:12:01,475
<i>he insisted on telling me
once again

171
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,560
<i>about his unifying theory
of life.

172
00:12:03,643 --> 00:12:06,980
It's certainly a phenomenon
in all walks of life.

173
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:08,398
What do you mean?

174
00:12:09,524 --> 00:12:11,651
Well, at one point,
you've got it.

175
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:14,321
Then you lose it,
and it's gone forever.

176
00:12:14,446 --> 00:12:16,114
All walks of life.

177
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,118
Georgie Best, for example,
had it, lost it.

178
00:12:20,202 --> 00:12:22,788
Or David Bowie, or Lou Reed.

179
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:24,873
Lou Reed? Some of his
solo stuff's not bad.

180
00:12:24,998 --> 00:12:27,751
No, it's not bad, but it's not
great either, is it?

181
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:29,336
In your heart, you kind of know

182
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:33,882
that although it sounds all
right, it's actually just shite.

183
00:12:35,634 --> 00:12:37,552
So who else?

184
00:12:38,595 --> 00:12:42,182
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven,
Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley.

185
00:12:42,307 --> 00:12:45,811
Okay, okay, so what is the point
you're trying to make?

186
00:12:47,437 --> 00:12:50,524
All I am trying to do, Mark,
is to help you understand

187
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:53,527
that "The Name of the Rose"
is merely a blip

188
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,655
on an otherwise uninterrupted
downward trajectory.

189
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,032
And what about
"The Untouchables"?

190
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,785
I don't rate that at all.

191
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:03,995
Despite the Academy Award?

192
00:13:04,704 --> 00:13:06,540
That means fuck all.

193
00:13:06,665 --> 00:13:08,625
It's a sympathy vote.

194
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:14,005
So we all get old, we can't hack
it anymore, and that's it?

195
00:13:14,714 --> 00:13:16,049
Yeah.

196
00:13:16,174 --> 00:13:18,093
That's your theory?

197
00:13:19,261 --> 00:13:20,512
Yeah.

198
00:13:21,638 --> 00:13:23,974
Beautifully fucking illustrated.

199
00:13:25,475 --> 00:13:27,269
Give me the gun.

200
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:29,521
Give me the gun.

201
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:38,280
Do you see the beast?

202
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:40,699
Have you got it in your sights?

203
00:13:40,782 --> 00:13:43,243
Clear enough, Miss Moneypenny.

204
00:13:43,368 --> 00:13:48,081
This should present
no significant problems.

205
00:13:53,545 --> 00:13:56,423
Aah! No!
Fuck! Aah!

206
00:13:56,548 --> 00:14:01,303
For a vegetarian, Rents,
you're a fucking evil shot.

207
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,472
No! Get off!

208
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,058
<i>Without heroin,
I attempted to lead a useful

209
00:14:06,141 --> 00:14:08,226
<i>and fulfilling life
as a good citizen.

210
00:14:14,316 --> 00:14:15,901
- Good luck, Spud.
- Cheers, Cowboy.

211
00:14:15,984 --> 00:14:19,071
Remember, if they think you're
not trying, you're in trouble.

212
00:14:19,196 --> 00:14:21,073
First hint of that,
they'll be on to the DHSS.

213
00:14:21,156 --> 00:14:22,908
"This cunt is not trying."

214
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:25,118
And your giro is
fucking finished, right?

215
00:14:25,243 --> 00:14:26,703
But then again, try too hard...

216
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:28,622
You might get the fucking job.

217
00:14:28,747 --> 00:14:29,539
Exactly.

218
00:14:29,623 --> 00:14:30,415
Nightmare.

219
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,085
It's a tightrope, Spud.
It's a fucking tightrope.

220
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,837
See, I just get pure shy
with the interviewer cats.

221
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:38,215
I get all nervous.
I can't answer the questions.

222
00:14:38,298 --> 00:14:41,760
I'm a footballer, and I get
nerves on the big occasion, man.

223
00:14:41,843 --> 00:14:43,053
Try some of this, Spud.

224
00:14:43,136 --> 00:14:46,306
Yeah, a little dab of speed
is just the ticket, man.

225
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:49,935
No, I went to Craigy.
Craig Newton.

226
00:14:50,018 --> 00:14:52,896
I just put down Royal Edinburgh
College to help get the job.

227
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,981
There's too much discrimination
in this town.

228
00:14:55,107 --> 00:14:56,274
They're both schools.

229
00:14:56,358 --> 00:14:57,943
We're all in this together.

230
00:14:58,026 --> 00:15:00,779
I want to put across the general
idea rather than the details.

231
00:15:00,862 --> 00:15:02,406
People get hung up on details.

232
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:04,825
Which school did I go to?
How many grades did I get?

233
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,660
It could be six.
Could be none.

234
00:15:06,785 --> 00:15:07,994
It's not important.

235
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,206
What is important
is that I am, yes?

236
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:15,210
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you
lied on your application?

237
00:15:15,335 --> 00:15:16,461
No!

238
00:15:16,586 --> 00:15:19,631
Yes, only to get my foot
in the door.

239
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:21,049
Showing initiative and that.

240
00:15:21,174 --> 00:15:23,260
You were referred by
the Department of Employment.

241
00:15:23,343 --> 00:15:26,221
There was no need for you to get
your "foot in the door,"

242
00:15:26,346 --> 00:15:27,848
as you put it.

243
00:15:27,973 --> 00:15:30,642
Cool. Whatever you say, man.
Sorry.

244
00:15:30,767 --> 00:15:32,644
You're the man,
the dude in the chair.

245
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:36,106
I am merely here.
But obviously I'm here.

246
00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:38,442
Mr. Murphy,
what exactly attracts you

247
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:40,485
to the leisure industry?

248
00:15:41,862 --> 00:15:44,156
In a word, pleasure.

249
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:46,533
Like, my pleasure
in other people's leisure.

250
00:15:46,658 --> 00:15:50,036
Do you see yourself
as having any weaknesses?

251
00:15:52,205 --> 00:15:55,041
Oh, yes, 'cause I'm a bit
of a perfectionist, actually.

252
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,042
Yes, I am.

253
00:15:56,168 --> 00:15:59,254
See, for me, it's got to be the
best, or it's nothing at all.

254
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:02,048
Like, if things get a bit dodgy,
I cannot be bothered.

255
00:16:02,174 --> 00:16:05,510
But I've got good vibes about
this interview thing today.

256
00:16:05,635 --> 00:16:08,346
Seems to me like
it's going pretty well.

257
00:16:09,806 --> 00:16:11,641
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

258
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:14,561
We'll let you know.

259
00:16:14,644 --> 00:16:15,687
The pleasure was mine.

260
00:16:15,812 --> 00:16:18,356
<i>Spud had done well.
I was proud of him.

261
00:16:18,482 --> 00:16:22,402
<i>He fucked up good and proper.
You had to hand it to Spud.

262
00:16:24,654 --> 00:16:26,031
Picture the scene.

263
00:16:26,114 --> 00:16:28,658
The other fucking week,
doing the fucking volley.

264
00:16:28,742 --> 00:16:30,077
Me and Tommy playing pool.

265
00:16:30,202 --> 00:16:32,454
I'm playing like
Paul fucking Newman by the way.

266
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:35,457
Giving the boy here
the tanning of a lifetime.

267
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,751
So it comes to the last shot.

268
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:40,003
The deciding ball
of the whole tournament.

269
00:16:40,087 --> 00:16:41,671
I'm on the black,
and he's in the corner,

270
00:16:41,755 --> 00:16:43,757
looking all fucking
biscuit-arsed,

271
00:16:43,882 --> 00:16:46,009
when this hard cunt comes in.

272
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:48,845
Obviously fucking
fancied himself, like.

273
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:50,680
Starts staring at me.

274
00:16:50,764 --> 00:16:52,391
Looking at me,
right fucking at me,

275
00:16:52,474 --> 00:16:55,143
as if to say,
"Come ahead, square, go."

276
00:16:55,268 --> 00:16:56,228
You know me.

277
00:16:56,353 --> 00:16:58,563
I'm not a type of cunt
that goes looking for bother.

278
00:16:58,688 --> 00:17:01,274
At the end of the day,
I'm the cunt with the pool cue,

279
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,861
and he can get the fire end
in his puss anytime he wanted.

280
00:17:04,945 --> 00:17:07,989
So I squares up, casual like.

281
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:12,035
What does the hard cunt do?
Or the so-called hard cunt?

282
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,370
Shites it.

283
00:17:13,453 --> 00:17:17,332
Puts down his drink, turns,
and gets the fuck out of there.

284
00:17:17,457 --> 00:17:21,628
And after that,
well, the game was mine.

285
00:17:25,841 --> 00:17:27,217
<i>And that was it.

286
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,094
<i>That was Begbie's story.

287
00:17:29,219 --> 00:17:31,596
<i>At least that was Begbie's
version of the story.

288
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,641
<i>But a couple of days later
I got the truth from Tommy.

289
00:17:34,766 --> 00:17:36,560
<i>You always got the truth
from Tommy.

290
00:17:36,643 --> 00:17:38,437
<i>It was one of
his major weaknesses.

291
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,605
<i>He never told lies,
he never took drugs,

292
00:17:40,731 --> 00:17:42,649
<i>and he never cheated
on anyone.

293
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,776
It was Wednesday morning.

294
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:46,820
We were in the volley
playing pool.

295
00:17:46,903 --> 00:17:48,321
That much is true.

296
00:17:48,405 --> 00:17:52,534
But Begbie is playing
absolutely fucking gash.

297
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:55,328
He's got a hangover so bad
he can hardly hold the cue,

298
00:17:55,454 --> 00:17:56,913
never mind pot a ball.

299
00:17:56,997 --> 00:17:58,999
I'm doing my best to lose,
you know.

300
00:17:59,124 --> 00:18:01,877
Trying to humor him, like,
but it's not doing any good.

301
00:18:02,002 --> 00:18:04,588
Every time I touch a ball,
I seem to pot something.

302
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,424
Every time Begbie goes near
the table, he fucks it up.

303
00:18:07,507 --> 00:18:10,010
Oh, fuck's sake.

304
00:18:11,136 --> 00:18:14,097
So he's got the hump, right?

305
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:17,559
But finally I manage to set it
up so all he has to do

306
00:18:17,684 --> 00:18:19,686
is to pot the black
to win one game

307
00:18:19,811 --> 00:18:21,480
to salvage a little bit of pride

308
00:18:21,563 --> 00:18:24,149
and maybe not kick
my head in, right?

309
00:18:24,274 --> 00:18:28,320
So he's on the black,
pressure shot.

310
00:18:30,739 --> 00:18:33,325
And it all goes wrong, big-time.

311
00:18:35,202 --> 00:18:36,203
Fuck!

312
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,996
Aah!

313
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,874
He picks on this specky
wee gadgee at the bar

314
00:18:40,999 --> 00:18:43,335
and accuses him of putting him
off by looking at him.

315
00:18:43,418 --> 00:18:44,377
Can you believe it?

316
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:46,338
The cunt hasn't glanced
in our direction.

317
00:18:46,463 --> 00:18:47,547
Fuck off!

318
00:18:47,672 --> 00:18:49,925
He was going to chib him,
I tell you.

319
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,427
Then I thought
he was going to do me.

320
00:18:55,222 --> 00:18:57,974
The beggar's
fucking psycho, man.

321
00:18:58,975 --> 00:19:02,687
But he's a mate, you know,
so what can you do?

322
00:19:02,771 --> 00:19:04,481
Can I borrow this?

323
00:19:04,564 --> 00:19:06,691
<i>What indeed could one do?

324
00:19:06,775 --> 00:19:09,486
<i>Just stand back and watch
and try not to get involved.

325
00:19:11,363 --> 00:19:14,282
<i>Begbie didn't do drugs, either.
He just did people.

326
00:19:14,408 --> 00:19:18,203
<i>That's what he got off on.
His own sensory addiction.

327
00:19:20,414 --> 00:19:22,416
Nobody move!

328
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,001
That lassie got glassed,

329
00:19:25,085 --> 00:19:28,255
and no cunt leaves here till
we find out what cunt did it.

330
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,881
Who the fuck are you?

331
00:19:30,006 --> 00:19:32,217
Yes!

332
00:19:32,342 --> 00:19:34,052
Ohh!

333
00:19:50,902 --> 00:19:53,947
Oh, Tom!
Oh, my God!

334
00:19:57,284 --> 00:19:58,744
Oh, Lizzy!

335
00:19:58,827 --> 00:19:59,870
Oh, Lizzy!

336
00:19:59,953 --> 00:20:02,247
Oh, Tom, come in me!

337
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:03,540
<i>And as I sat watching

I read it in "Cosmopolitan."

347
00:21:01,306 --> 00:21:02,849
It's an interesting theory.

348
00:21:02,974 --> 00:21:04,518
Actually, it's a nightmare.

349
00:21:04,643 --> 00:21:06,103
I've been desperate for a shag,

350
00:21:06,186 --> 00:21:09,439
but watching him suffer
was just too much fun.

351
00:21:09,523 --> 00:21:11,149
You should try it with Tommy.

352
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:14,611
What, and deny myself the only
pleasure I get from him?

353
00:21:14,694 --> 00:21:16,238
Did I tell you about
my birthday?

354
00:21:16,363 --> 00:21:17,072
What happened?

355
00:21:17,197 --> 00:21:19,658
He forgot.
Useless motherfucker.

356
00:21:46,768 --> 00:21:49,271
What are you two talking about?

357
00:21:49,646 --> 00:21:51,189
Football!

358
00:21:51,314 --> 00:21:52,691
What are you talking about?

359
00:21:52,774 --> 00:21:54,192
Shopping.

360
00:21:55,277 --> 00:21:57,738
<i>The situation
was becoming serious.

361
00:21:57,863 --> 00:22:01,032
<i>Young Renton noticed the haste

362

<i>in the sexual sphere,
as in all others,

363
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,121

<i># Keep us from temptation #

367
00:22:15,589 --> 00:22:18,133
<i>Heroin had robbed Renton
of his sex drive,

368
00:22:18,258 --> 00:22:20,761
<i>but now it returned
with a vengeance.

369
00:22:20,886 --> 00:22:24,055
<i>And as the impotence of
those days faded into memory,

370
00:22:24,181 --> 00:22:27,851

<i>His post-junk libido, fueled
by alcohol and amphetamine,

372

his own unsatisfied desire.

00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:38,111
<i>Dot, dot, dot.

374

<i>And with that,
Mark Renton had fallen in love.

385
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,642
Excuse me,
I don't mean to harass you,

386
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:53,270
but I was very impressed
with the capable manner

387
00:23:53,353 --> 00:23:54,855
in which you dealt with that.

388
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,399
I was thinking to myself,
"This girl's special."

389
00:23:57,524 --> 00:23:58,483
Thanks.

390
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:00,485
- What's your name?
- Diane.

391
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:02,654
- Where are you going, Diane?
- I'm going home.

392
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:04,489
- Where's that?
- It's where you live.

393
00:24:04,614 --> 00:24:05,532
Great.

394
00:24:05,657 --> 00:24:06,742
What?

395
00:24:06,867 --> 00:24:10,287
I'll come back with you,
but I'm not promising anything.

396
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,789
Do you find that this approach
usually works?

397
00:24:12,873 --> 00:24:15,375
Or, let me guess,
you've never tried it before.

398
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:18,503
In fact, you don't normally
approach girls, am I right?

399
00:24:18,628 --> 00:24:21,548
The truth is that you're
a quiet, sensitive type,

400
00:24:21,631 --> 00:24:23,467
but if I'm prepared to
take a chance,

401
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,719
I might just get to know
the inner you.

402
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:30,223
Witty, adventurous, passionate,
loving, loyal.

403
00:24:30,348 --> 00:24:32,225
Taxi!

404
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,728
A little bit crazy,
a little bit bad.

405
00:24:34,853 --> 00:24:38,815
But, hey, don't us girls
just love that?

406
00:24:41,193 --> 00:24:43,070
Well, what's wrong, boy?

407
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:44,654
Cat got your tongue?

408
00:24:44,738 --> 00:24:46,823
I left something.

409
00:24:47,783 --> 00:24:49,826
Are you getting in or not, pal?

410
00:25:10,972 --> 00:25:13,016
Do you understand?

411
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,395
I expect you to be a considerate
and thoughtful lover.

412
00:25:16,478 --> 00:25:18,522
Generous but firm.

413
00:25:18,605 --> 00:25:19,356
What?

414
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:22,776
Failure on your part to live up
to these reasonable expectations

415
00:25:22,901 --> 00:25:27,489
will result in swift resumption
of a non-sex situation.

416
00:25:27,614 --> 00:25:28,907
Right?

417
00:25:41,503 --> 00:25:42,754
Diane.

418
00:25:42,879 --> 00:25:43,922
Shh!

419
00:25:44,047 --> 00:25:44,673
What?

420
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:46,925
Shut up!

421
00:26:27,257 --> 00:26:29,134
Wake up, Spud.

422
00:26:29,676 --> 00:26:31,261
Wake up.

423
00:26:31,344 --> 00:26:33,138
Sex.

424
00:26:34,431 --> 00:26:36,308
Casual sex.

425
00:26:43,607 --> 00:26:46,318
Tommy, let's put the tape on.

426
00:26:46,401 --> 00:26:47,360
Now?

427
00:26:47,486 --> 00:26:50,155
I want to watch ourselves
while we're screwing.

428
00:26:50,238 --> 00:26:52,991
So let's see what I'm missing.

429
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:09,466
Not much.

430
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,803
Pushed forward again.

431
00:27:12,886 --> 00:27:14,846
And there's the captain,
Archie Gemmill,

432
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,890
picking it up from the outside.

433
00:27:16,973 --> 00:27:18,392
I think he wants to go himself.

434
00:27:18,517 --> 00:27:20,685
He's gonna go.
He's going all the way.

435
00:27:20,811 --> 00:27:22,187
And he scores!

436
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,981
Oh, what a magnificent goal!

437
00:27:25,065 --> 00:27:27,192
Gemmill at his very best!

438
00:27:27,275 --> 00:27:30,362
What a penetrating goal
that was!

439
00:27:30,487 --> 00:27:32,155
I haven't felt that good

440
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:35,659
since Archie Gemmill scored
against Holland in 1978.

441
00:27:39,454 --> 00:27:40,914
You can't sleep here.

442
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,250
- What?
- Out.

443
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:44,543
Come on!

444
00:27:44,668 --> 00:27:47,379
No argument. You can sleep on
the sofa in the hall or go home.

445
00:27:47,462 --> 00:27:48,880
It's up to you.

446
00:27:50,257 --> 00:27:52,676
And don't make any noise.

447
00:27:53,593 --> 00:27:55,262
Jesus!

448
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,687
What do you mean, "It's gone"?

449
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:07,482
- Where has it gone, Tommy?
- It'll be here somewhere!

450
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:11,278
I might have returned it
by mistake.

451
00:28:11,403 --> 00:28:12,404
Returned it?

452
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:16,366
Where?
The video shop, Tommy?

453
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,077
The fucking video shop?

454
00:28:19,161 --> 00:28:23,540
So every punter in Edinburgh
is jerking off to our video?

455
00:28:24,124 --> 00:28:27,294
Oh, God, Tommy, I feel sick.

456
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:53,070
<i># Oh, you've got green eyes #

457

Eh?

466
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:49,960
Come in and sit down.

467
00:29:50,043 --> 00:29:51,795
Like some coffee?

468
00:29:51,878 --> 00:29:52,671
Aye.

469
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,007
You must be Mark.

470
00:29:56,133 --> 00:29:57,717
Aye, that's me.

471
00:30:03,265 --> 00:30:04,891
You're a friend of Diane's?

472
00:30:05,016 --> 00:30:06,685
More of a friend
of a friend, no?

473
00:30:06,768 --> 00:30:07,894
Right.

474
00:30:10,397 --> 00:30:12,482
Are you her flatmates, like?

475
00:30:14,151 --> 00:30:16,027
Flatmates?

476
00:30:16,153 --> 00:30:17,988
I must remember that one.

477
00:30:19,364 --> 00:30:20,949
Morning.

478
00:30:35,881 --> 00:30:37,466
Good morning, Spud.

479
00:30:37,591 --> 00:30:40,719
Gail.
Mr. Houston, Mrs. Houston.

480
00:30:40,802 --> 00:30:43,889
Good morning, Spud. Sit down
and have some breakfast.

481
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,393
I'm sorry about last night,
by the way.

482
00:30:48,518 --> 00:30:51,605
That's all right.
I slept fine on the sofa.

483
00:30:52,689 --> 00:30:56,568
I had a bit much to drink.
I had a bit of an accident.

484
00:30:56,651 --> 00:30:58,695
Don't worry, son.
These things happen.

485
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:02,074
It does a man good to cut loose
once in a while.

486
00:31:02,157 --> 00:31:05,077
This one could do with being
tied up once in a while.

487
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,912
I'll put the sheets
in the machine.

488
00:31:06,995 --> 00:31:09,081
No, no, no, I'll wash them.

489
00:31:09,164 --> 00:31:10,916
- There's no need.
- It's no problem.

490
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,042
It's no problem for me.

491
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:13,752
I'd rather take care
of it myself.

492
00:31:13,877 --> 00:31:15,087
Honestly, it's no problem.

493
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:16,088
Really, no!

494
00:31:16,213 --> 00:31:18,423
Spud, they're my sheets!

495
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:32,104
I don't see why not.

496
00:31:32,187 --> 00:31:33,897
Because it's illegal.
That's why not.

497
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,065
What? Holding hands?

498
00:31:35,148 --> 00:31:36,274
Not holding hands.

499
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,943
In that case, you can do it.

500
00:31:38,068 --> 00:31:39,236
You were quite happy to do
a lot more last night.

501
00:31:39,236 --> 00:31:40,362
You were quite happy to do
a lot more last night.

502
00:31:40,487 --> 00:31:41,988
Yeah, and that's what's illegal.

503
00:31:42,114 --> 00:31:43,657
Do you know what they'd do
to me inside?

504
00:31:43,782 --> 00:31:46,159
They cut your balls off and
flush them down the toilet.

505
00:31:46,284 --> 00:31:48,245
Calm down.
You're not going to jail.

506
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,622
Well, that's very easy
for you to say, Diane.

507
00:31:50,705 --> 00:31:53,625
- Can I see you again?
- Certainly not!

508
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:57,087
If you don't see me again,
I'll tell the police.

509
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,883
I'll see you around then.

510
00:32:14,896 --> 00:32:16,481
Now what?

511
00:32:17,107 --> 00:32:18,150
We're going for a walk.

512
00:32:18,275 --> 00:32:19,276
What?

513
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:21,027
A walk!

514
00:32:21,987 --> 00:32:22,946
Where?

515
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:24,614
There!

516
00:32:25,991 --> 00:32:28,160
Are you serious?

517
00:33:01,735 --> 00:33:03,945
Well, what are you waiting for?

518
00:33:04,446 --> 00:33:05,697
Tommy.

519
00:33:07,616 --> 00:33:09,534
This is not natural, man.

520
00:33:10,202 --> 00:33:12,746
It's the great outdoors!

521
00:33:12,871 --> 00:33:14,414
It's fresh air.

522
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:17,542
Look, Tommy, we know you're
getting a hard time off Lizzy,

523
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:20,545
but there's really no need
to take it out on us.

524
00:33:20,629 --> 00:33:22,589
Doesn't it make you proud
to be Scottish?

525
00:33:22,714 --> 00:33:25,550
It's shite being Scottish!

526
00:33:25,634 --> 00:33:27,761
We're the lowest of the low.

527
00:33:27,886 --> 00:33:30,222
The scum of the fucking Earth.

528

miserable, servile,

529

pathetic trash that was ever
shat into civilization.

530
00:33:36,561 --> 00:33:38,438
Some people hate the English.
I don't.

531
00:33:38,563 --> 00:33:40,232
They're just wankers.

532
00:33:40,315 --> 00:33:43,902
We, on the other hand,
are colonized by wankers.

533
00:33:44,027 --> 00:33:48,031
We can't even find a decent
culture to be colonized by.

534
00:33:48,156 --> 00:33:50,909
We're ruled by effete arseholes.

535
00:33:51,034 --> 00:33:53,203
It's a shite state of affairs
to be in, Tommy,

536
00:33:53,286 --> 00:33:54,704
and all the fresh air
in the world

537
00:33:54,788 --> 00:33:57,499
won't make any fucking
difference!

538
00:34:06,633 --> 00:34:08,343
Sorry, man.
I'm sorry.

539
00:34:08,468 --> 00:34:11,221
No, I appreciate it, Tommy.

That's what everyone says.

550
00:35:02,314 --> 00:35:06,485
The embodiment, right,
of his superiority to us.

551
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:09,988
Beautiful, exotic,
highly sexual,

I mean, let's face it, mate.

555
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,082
She'd shag one punter
from Edinburgh,

556
00:35:20,207 --> 00:35:22,292
she'd shag
the whole fucking lot of us.

557

Well done.

558

Lizzy's gone, Mark.

560
00:35:49,403 --> 00:35:52,364
She's gone
and fucking dumped me.

561
00:35:52,447 --> 00:35:55,534
It was that videotape

562
00:35:55,659 --> 00:35:57,244
and that Iggy Pop business

563
00:35:57,369 --> 00:35:59,204
and other sorts of shit.

564
00:35:59,287 --> 00:36:03,250
She told me where to go
and no fucking mistake.

565
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:05,335
I said to her,

566
00:36:05,419 --> 00:36:07,212
"Is there any chance
of getting back together?"

567
00:36:07,337 --> 00:36:10,424
But no way, no fucking way.

568

Honor Blackman, A.K.A.
Pussy Galore, right?

569
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:19,558
What a total fucking misnomer.

570
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,395
I mean, I wouldn't touch her
with yours.

571
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,772
I want to try it, Mark.

572
00:36:26,773 --> 00:36:29,609
You're always going on about how
it's the ultimate hit.

573
00:36:29,735 --> 00:36:31,611
Better than sex.

574

I'm a fucking adult.

575

I've got the money.

Personality. I mean,
that's what counts, right?

578
00:36:52,883 --> 00:36:53,759
Personality.

579
00:36:53,884 --> 00:36:57,471
That's what keeps a relationship
going through the years.

580
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:00,891

00:40:27,722 --> 00:40:30,976
Fucking say something!

638
00:40:36,648 --> 00:40:38,817
I'm cooking up.

639
00:40:55,709 --> 00:40:58,003
Cook us up a shot, Rents.

640
00:40:58,128 --> 00:41:00,630
I need a hit.

641
00:41:01,506 --> 00:41:04,384
<i>And so she did.
I could understand that.

642
00:41:04,509 --> 00:41:06,762
<i>To take the pain away.

643
00:41:07,929 --> 00:41:10,807
<i>So I cooked up,
and she got a hit.

644
00:41:10,891 --> 00:41:12,893
<i>But only after me.

645
00:41:12,976 --> 00:41:15,270
<i>That went without saying.

646
00:41:17,064 --> 00:41:19,983
<i>Well, at least we knew
who the father was now.

647
00:41:20,067 --> 00:41:22,444
<i>It wasn't just the baby
that died that day.

648
00:41:22,569 --> 00:41:24,488
<i>Something inside Sick Boy
was lost and never returned.

649
00:41:24,529 --> 00:41:26,448
<i>Something inside Sick Boy
was lost and never returned.

650
00:41:26,573 --> 00:41:27,866
<i>It seemed he had no theory

651
00:41:27,991 --> 00:41:30,077
<i>with which to explain a moment
like this.

652
00:41:30,202 --> 00:41:32,037
<i>Nor did I.

653
00:41:32,162 --> 00:41:35,207
<i>Our only response was to keep
on going and fuck everything.

654
00:41:35,332 --> 00:41:37,375
<i>Pile misery upon misery,

655
00:41:37,501 --> 00:41:39,961
<i>heap it up on a spoon
and dissolve it with bile,

656
00:41:40,087 --> 00:41:42,339
<i>then squirt it into a stinking,
purulent vein,

657
00:41:42,422 --> 00:41:44,216
<i>and do it all over again.

658
00:41:44,299 --> 00:41:46,426
<i>Keep on going, getting up,
going out, robbing,

659
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:48,053
<i>stealing, fucking people over,

660
00:41:48,178 --> 00:41:49,721
<i>propelling ourselves
with longing

661
00:41:49,846 --> 00:41:52,349
<i>towards the day
that it would all go wrong.

662
00:41:52,432 --> 00:41:55,644
<i>Because no matter how much you
stash or how much you steal,

663
00:41:55,769 --> 00:41:57,104
<i>you never have enough.

664
00:41:57,229 --> 00:41:59,898
<i>No matter how often you go out
and rob and fuck people over,

665
00:42:00,023 --> 00:42:03,193
<i>you always need to get up
and do it all over again.

666
00:42:06,488 --> 00:42:10,951
<i>Sooner or later, this kind
of thing was bound to happen.

667
00:42:16,498 --> 00:42:19,042
Because shoplifting is theft,
 which is a crime,

668
00:42:19,126 --> 00:42:20,710
and despite
what you may believe,

669
00:42:20,836 --> 00:42:23,630
there is no such entity
as victimless crime.

670
00:42:23,755 --> 00:42:25,298
Heroin addiction
may explain your actions,

671
00:42:25,424 --> 00:42:27,259
but it does not excuse them.

672
00:42:27,342 --> 00:42:29,553
Mr. Murphy,
you are a habitual thief,

673
00:42:29,636 --> 00:42:31,638
devoid of regret and remorse.

674
00:42:31,721 --> 00:42:33,765
In sentencing you
to six months imprisonment,

675
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:37,352
my only worry is it will not
be long before we meet again.

676
00:42:37,477 --> 00:42:40,063
Mr. Renton, I understand
that you have entered

677
00:42:40,147 --> 00:42:41,940
into a program of rehabilitation

678
00:42:42,065 --> 00:42:45,152
in an attempt to wean yourself
away from heroin.

679
00:42:45,277 --> 00:42:47,821
The suspension of your sentence

680
00:42:47,946 --> 00:42:51,199
is conditional on your continued
cooperation with this program.

681
00:42:51,324 --> 00:42:53,285
Should you stand guilty
before me again,

682
00:42:53,368 --> 00:42:56,663
I shall not hesitate to impose
a custodial sentence.

683
00:42:56,788 --> 00:42:58,999
Thank you, Your Honor.

684
00:42:59,124 --> 00:43:03,044
With God's help, I'll conquer
this terrible affliction.

685
00:43:17,768 --> 00:43:19,269
<i>What can you say?

686
00:43:19,352 --> 00:43:21,772
<i>Well,
Begbie had a phrase for it.

687
00:43:21,855 --> 00:43:24,483
It was obvious that cunt
was going to fuck some cunt.

688
00:43:24,608 --> 00:43:26,985
Well, I hope you learnt
your lesson, son.

689
00:43:27,069 --> 00:43:30,822
Oh, my son, I thought
I was gonna lose you there.

690
00:43:30,947 --> 00:43:35,494
You're nothing but trouble
to me, but I still love you!

691
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:38,997
You better clean up your act.
Cut that shite out forever.

692
00:43:39,122 --> 00:43:41,333
You listen to Francis.
He's talking sense.

693
00:43:41,416 --> 00:43:42,501
Fucking right I am.

694
00:43:42,626 --> 00:43:45,629
See, inside, you wouldn't last
two fucking days.

695
00:43:45,712 --> 00:43:48,215
There's better things
than the needle, Rents.

696
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,216
Choose life.

697
00:43:49,341 --> 00:43:51,343
I remember
when you were a wee baby.

698
00:43:51,468 --> 00:43:53,428
Oh, mama's little baby loves.

699
00:43:53,553 --> 00:43:55,013
<i># Shortening, shortening #

700
00:43:55,138 --> 00:43:58,016
<i># Mama's little baby loves
shortening bread #

701
00:44:10,695 --> 00:44:13,490
I'm sorry, Mrs. Murphy.

702
00:44:13,573 --> 00:44:16,701
That wasn't any fair.
Spud going down and not me.

703
00:44:19,037 --> 00:44:20,997
Well, it's not our fault!

704
00:44:22,374 --> 00:44:24,709
Your boy went down
because he was a smack-head,

705
00:44:24,835 --> 00:44:28,130
and if that's not your fault,
then I don't know what is.

706
00:44:30,132 --> 00:44:33,218
That was that fucking cunt.

707
00:44:36,263 --> 00:44:37,389
I'll get the drinks.

708
00:44:37,514 --> 00:44:39,433
Aye.

709
00:44:41,435 --> 00:44:43,770
<i>I wished I'd gone down
instead of Spud.

710
00:44:43,895 --> 00:44:47,858
<i>Here I was surrounded by my
family and my so-called mates,

711
00:44:47,983 --> 00:44:51,611
<i>and I've never felt so alone,
never in all my puff.

712
00:44:54,698 --> 00:44:57,200
<i>Since I was on remand,
they've had me on this program.

713
00:44:57,325 --> 00:44:59,453
<i>The state-sponsored addiction.

714
00:44:59,578 --> 00:45:01,204
<i>Three sickly sweet doses

715
00:45:01,288 --> 00:45:03,582
<i>of methadone a day
instead of smack.

716
00:45:03,707 --> 00:45:06,084
<i>But it's never enough.

717
00:45:06,209 --> 00:45:09,129
<i>And at the moment,
it's nowhere near enough.

718
00:45:09,963 --> 00:45:11,256
<i>I took all three this morning,

719
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:13,925
<i>and now I've got 18 hours
to go till my next shot

720
00:45:14,009 --> 00:45:17,637
<i>and a sweat on my back
like a layer of frost.

721
00:45:17,763 --> 00:45:21,641
<i>I need to visit the Mother
Superior for one hit.

722
00:45:21,767 --> 00:45:27,689
<i>One fucking hit to get us
over this long, hard day.

723
00:45:30,942 --> 00:45:32,527
What's on the menu
this evening, sir?

724
00:45:32,652 --> 00:45:35,447
- Your favorite dish.
- Excellent.

725
00:45:35,572 --> 00:45:38,116
- Usual table, sir?
- Oh, why, thank you.

726
00:45:38,241 --> 00:45:41,453
Would sir care to pay
for his bill in advance?

727
00:45:41,536 --> 00:45:43,121
No, stick it on my tab.

728
00:45:43,246 --> 00:45:44,456
Regret to inform, sir,

729
00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:47,626
credit limit was reached and
breached quite some time ago.

730
00:45:47,751 --> 00:45:50,087
Oh, well, in that case.

731
00:45:50,545 --> 00:45:52,756
Hard currency!
That'll do nicely.

732
00:45:52,839 --> 00:45:56,259
Can't be too careful when we're
dealing with your type, can we?

733
00:45:57,344 --> 00:46:00,305
Would sir care for a starter?
Some garlic bread perhaps?

734
00:46:00,388 --> 00:46:02,724
No, thank you.
I'll proceed directly

735
00:46:02,849 --> 00:46:05,769
to the intravenous injection
of hard drugs, please.

736
00:46:06,353 --> 00:46:08,105
As you wish, sir.

737
00:46:08,188 --> 00:46:10,607

your own mother and father.

- No!

You're worse coming off that
than heroin.

- Nothing at all.
- It's a clean break this time.

I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

798
00:52:37,536 --> 00:52:39,996
But I just need one more score.

799
00:52:40,122 --> 00:52:43,208
Just bring me one more hit.

Well, this is a good
fucking laugh, ain't it?

You sweat that shite
out of your system,

Question number one.

812
00:53:51,485 --> 00:53:54,571
The human immunodeficiency virus
is a...

813

Retrovirus?

814
00:53:56,323 --> 00:53:58,825
Retrovirus is the right answer!

815
00:54:08,418 --> 00:54:11,671
It's a mug's game, Mrs. Renton.

816
00:54:11,797 --> 00:54:14,633
I mean, I'm not saying
I was blameless myself.

817

But there comes a time

818

when you have to turn your back
on that nonsense

819

and just say no.

820

Just say no.

Question number two.

824
00:55:01,096 --> 00:55:05,517
H.I.V. binds to which receptor
on the host lymphocyte?

825
00:55:05,642 --> 00:55:07,811
Which receptor is that?

CD4 is the right answer!

00:55:24,995 --> 00:55:27,456
Better than sex.

832
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:29,791
The ultimate hit.

833

I'm a fucking adult.
I can find out for myself.

834

I mean, how can it be armed
robbery with a fucking replica?

955
01:04:01,803 --> 01:04:04,222
Fucking scandal.

956
01:04:04,514 --> 01:04:07,476
And the gear.
Look.

957
01:04:09,352 --> 01:04:12,898
Supposed to be solid silver.
It's fucking garbage.

958
01:04:13,023 --> 01:04:15,901
There's couples investing
all their hopes in that stuff.

959
01:04:15,984 --> 01:04:18,403
- It's a scandal, Franco.
- Too fucking right it is.

960
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:20,697
And I don't want any
pot noodles, by the way.

961
01:04:20,822 --> 01:04:22,866
I'm fucking Lee Marvin.

962
01:04:31,249 --> 01:04:32,584
Hey, Rents.

963
01:04:32,709 --> 01:04:36,129
<i>Begbie settled in

Pop into bookie's

Can you not go yourself?

990
01:05:52,664 --> 01:05:54,624
Well, seeing as how I'm
a fugitive from the law,

991

Fucking listen to me,

A joke's a fucking joke.

1024
01:08:24,983 --> 01:08:28,111
You mention that again,
and I'll cut you up.

1025
01:08:28,195 --> 01:08:30,405
You understand?

1026
01:08:35,869 --> 01:08:36,953
<i>Since I last saw him,

1027
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:40,123
<i>Sick Boy had reinvented himself
as a pimp and a pusher

1028

to mix business and pleasure,

1029
01:08:42,834 --> 01:08:46,129
<i>setting up "contacts,"
as he constantly informed me,

1030
01:08:46,213 --> 01:08:50,092

was going to make him rich.

Good chips.

1032
01:08:58,517 --> 01:09:01,228
I can't believe you did that.

1033
01:09:03,647 --> 01:09:05,816
I got a good price for it.

1034
01:09:05,899 --> 01:09:07,484
Rents, I need the money.

1035
01:09:07,567 --> 01:09:10,153
It was my fucking telly!

1036
01:09:10,278 --> 01:09:12,948
Well, if I'd known you were
going to get so humpty,

1037
01:09:13,031 --> 01:09:15,117
I wouldn't have bothered.

1038
01:09:17,536 --> 01:09:19,913
Fucking rented, anyway.

1039
01:09:20,747 --> 01:09:22,624
You going to eat that?

1040
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:30,173
Have you got a passport?

1041
01:09:30,298 --> 01:09:31,842
Why?

1042
01:09:31,925 --> 01:09:33,677
I met this bloke.

1043
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:35,846
Runs a hotel, a brothel.

1044
01:09:35,929 --> 01:09:37,889
Loads of contacts.

1045
01:09:38,014 --> 01:09:39,141
Does a nice sideline

1046
01:09:39,224 --> 01:09:41,852
in punting British passports
to foreigners.

1047
01:09:41,935 --> 01:09:43,687
Get you a good price.

1048
01:09:43,770 --> 01:09:46,732
And why would I want
to sell my passport?

1049
01:09:50,861 --> 01:09:52,654
It was just an idea.

1050
01:09:53,905 --> 01:09:55,907
<i>I had to get rid of them.

1051
01:09:56,032 --> 01:09:59,327
<i>Sick Boy didn't do his drug
deal, and he didn't get rich.

1052
01:09:59,411 --> 01:10:01,705
<i>Instead, he and Begbie
hung around my bed-sit

1053

<i>looking for things to steal.

1054
01:10:03,415 --> 01:10:07,043
<i>I decided to put them in
the worst place in the world.

1055
01:10:10,505 --> 01:10:14,718
<i># Sandman goes, two in tow #

01:10:21,516 --> 01:10:24,936
<i># Coming down again #

1058
01:10:33,612 --> 01:10:35,489
<i>They weren't paying
any rent,

1059
01:10:35,614 --> 01:10:38,241
<i>so when my boss
found two suckers who would,

1060
01:10:38,366 --> 01:10:41,328
<i>Sick Boy and Begbie were bound
to feel threatened.

1061
01:10:41,453 --> 01:10:44,998
Yep, lots of storage.
All mod cons.

1062
01:10:45,123 --> 01:10:47,250
320 quid a week.

1063
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,504
- Aah!
- Aah!

1064
01:10:50,629 --> 01:10:51,963
<i>And that was that.

1065
01:10:52,798 --> 01:10:55,467
<i>But by then we had another
reason to go back.

1066
01:10:55,592 --> 01:10:56,843
<i>Tommy.

1067
01:10:56,968 --> 01:10:58,970
Tommy knew he'd got
the virus, like,

1068
01:10:59,096 --> 01:11:01,848
but he never knew
he'd gone full-blown.

1069
01:11:01,973 --> 01:11:04,017
What was it,
pneumonia or cancer?

1070
01:11:04,142 --> 01:11:06,603
No, toxoplasmosis.

1071
01:11:06,728 --> 01:11:08,647
Sort of like a stroke.

1072
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:10,232
How's that?

1073
01:11:10,982 --> 01:11:13,568
He wanted to see Lizzy again.

1074
01:11:14,152 --> 01:11:16,238
She wouldn't let him
near the house.

1075
01:11:16,321 --> 01:11:19,950
So he bought her a present,
brought her this kitten.

1076
01:11:20,075 --> 01:11:21,993
I bet Lizzy told him
where to stick it.

1077
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:25,122
Exactly. "I'm not wanting
that cat," she says.

1078
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:26,540
Get the fuck, right.

1079
01:11:26,665 --> 01:11:29,960
So there's Tommy stuck
with this kitten.

1080
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:31,211
You can imagine what happened.

1081
01:11:31,336 --> 01:11:33,797
To those of us
gathered here today,

1082
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:38,093
Thomas McKenzie filled a number
of different roles in our lives.

1083
01:11:38,176 --> 01:11:39,761
- What?
- Thomas was a son.

1084
01:11:39,845 --> 01:11:41,430
The thing was neglected.

1085
01:11:41,513 --> 01:11:43,807
Pissing and shitting
all over the place.

1086
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:44,975
Tommy's lying about,

1087
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:48,478
fucked out of his eyeballs
on smack or downers.

1088
01:11:48,603 --> 01:11:52,023
He never knew you could get
toxoplasmosis from cat shit.

1089
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:56,903
A loving man with a great lust
for life.

1090
01:11:57,738 --> 01:11:59,322
Neither did I.
What is it?

1091
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:01,616
Fucking horrible.

1092
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:03,577
It's like an abscess
in your brain.

1093
01:12:03,702 --> 01:12:05,495
Fucking hell.

1094
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:06,747
Then what happened?

1095
01:12:06,872 --> 01:12:09,458
He starts getting
these headaches,

1096
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:12,794
so he just uses more smack,
you know, for the pain, like.

1097
01:12:12,878 --> 01:12:14,963
And then he has a stroke.

1098
01:12:15,046 --> 01:12:18,884
A fucking stroke.
Just like that.

1099
01:12:19,009 --> 01:12:21,970
Gets home from the hospital
and dies three weeks later.

1100
01:12:23,221 --> 01:12:24,556
He'd been dead for ages

1101
01:12:24,681 --> 01:12:26,808
before the neighbors
complained about the smell

1102
01:12:26,892 --> 01:12:29,811
and got the police
to break down the door.

1103
01:12:29,895 --> 01:12:32,230
Tommy was lying facedown
in a pool of vomit.

1104
01:12:32,355 --> 01:12:33,982
He has gone from us,

1105
01:12:34,066 --> 01:12:37,486
but we have many things
to remember him by.

1106
01:12:37,569 --> 01:12:38,570
The kitten was fine.

1107
01:12:38,695 --> 01:12:41,907
Would you all please rise now
for the committal?

1108
01:12:45,243 --> 01:12:50,332
<i># Did you think
I would leave you crying #

on my horse for two? #

1110
01:12:56,046 --> 01:13:00,675
<i># Climb up here, Tommy,
don't be dying #

1111
01:13:00,759 --> 01:13:05,180
<i># I can go just as fast
with two #

1112
01:13:05,263 --> 01:13:10,102
<i># When we grow up,
we'll both be soldiers #

1113
01:13:10,227 --> 01:13:14,940
<i># And our horses
will not be toys #

1114
01:13:15,065 --> 01:13:20,028
<i># And I wonder
if we'll remember #

1115
01:13:20,153 --> 01:13:24,658
<i># When we were
two little boys #

1116
01:13:27,452 --> 01:13:29,579
- Tommy.
- Tommy.

1117
01:13:34,084 --> 01:13:36,044
Did you tell him yet?

1118
01:13:37,087 --> 01:13:38,130
On you go.

1119
01:13:38,255 --> 01:13:39,714
What?

1120
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,466
There's this mate of Swanney's.

1121
01:13:41,591 --> 01:13:43,301
You know the guy.
Mikey Forrester.

1122
01:13:43,427 --> 01:13:44,636
Aye.

1123
01:13:45,137 --> 01:13:50,475
Well, he's come into some gear.

1124
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:51,560
A lot of gear.

1125
01:13:51,685 --> 01:13:53,145
How much gear?

1126
01:13:54,938 --> 01:14:00,110
About two kilos, so he tells me.

1127
01:14:00,193 --> 01:14:03,321
He got drunk in a pub down
by the docks last week,

1128
01:14:03,447 --> 01:14:05,907
where he met
two Russian sailors.

1129
01:14:06,032 --> 01:14:08,618
They're fucking carrying
this stuff for sale,

1130
01:14:08,702 --> 01:14:10,120
there and then, like.

1131
01:14:10,203 --> 01:14:13,623
So he wakes up the next morning,

1132
01:14:13,707 --> 01:14:17,461
realizes what he's done,
gets very fucking nervous.

1133
01:14:17,544 --> 01:14:19,129
He wants rid of this, right?

1134
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:20,213
So?

1135
01:14:20,338 --> 01:14:24,134
So he met me, and I offered
to take it off his hands

1136
01:14:24,217 --> 01:14:26,887
at a very reasonable price,
with the intention

1137
01:14:27,012 --> 01:14:29,556
of punting it on myself
to a guy I know in London.

1138
01:14:29,681 --> 01:14:30,474
Ho ho-ho-ho!

1139
01:14:30,557 --> 01:14:32,559
We've just come back
from Tommy's funeral,

1140
01:14:32,684 --> 01:14:35,145
and you're talking
about a scag deal?

1141
01:14:36,730 --> 01:14:38,148
Aye.

1142
01:14:41,902 --> 01:14:43,737
What was your price?

1143
01:14:43,862 --> 01:14:45,822
- Four grand.
- You haven't got four grand?

1144
01:14:45,947 --> 01:14:47,574
We're 2,000 short.

1145
01:14:47,699 --> 01:14:49,910
Well, that's tough.

1146
01:14:50,035 --> 01:14:53,914
Look, every cunt knows you've
been saving up down in London.

1147
01:14:54,039 --> 01:14:56,166
I'm sorry.
I do not have two grand.

1148
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:59,211
Aye, you fucking do.

1149
01:15:00,712 --> 01:15:02,422
I've seen your bank statement.

1150
01:15:02,547 --> 01:15:04,841
For fuck's sake.

1151
01:15:04,925 --> 01:15:09,346
2, 133.

1152
01:15:09,429 --> 01:15:12,682
Two kilos.
What is that, 10 years?

1153
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:14,518
Mikey Forrester?
Russian sailors?

1154
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:16,728
What the fuck
are you boys on, eh?

1155
01:15:16,853 --> 01:15:18,522
Spud, you've already been
to jail.

1156
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:21,108
What's the deal? You like it
so much you want to go back?

1157
01:15:21,233 --> 01:15:23,610
I just want the money, Mark.

1158
01:15:23,735 --> 01:15:25,612
If everybody keeps
their mouth shut,

1159
01:15:25,737 --> 01:15:28,281
there'll be no cunt
going to jail.

1160
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:34,538
<i>There were a lot
of possibilities running

1161
01:15:34,663 --> 01:15:37,290
<i>through my mind about
what might happen in London.

1162
01:15:37,416 --> 01:15:40,627
<i>Things I didn't want to talk
to anyone about,

1163
01:15:40,752 --> 01:15:43,797
<i>ideas best kept to myself.

1164
01:15:43,922 --> 01:15:45,966
<i>No one told me
when we bought the scag,

1165
01:15:46,091 --> 01:15:48,844
<i>some lucky punter
would have to try it out.

1166
01:15:53,014 --> 01:15:54,641
<i>Begbie didn't trust Spud.

1167
01:15:54,766 --> 01:15:57,144
<i>Sick Boy was too careful
these days.

1168
01:15:57,269 --> 01:16:00,397
<i>So I rolled up my sleeve,
I spiked my vein,

1169
01:16:00,522 --> 01:16:02,232
<i>and I did what had to be done.

1170
01:16:06,027 --> 01:16:07,904
It's good.

1171
01:16:08,029 --> 01:16:11,116
Oh, it's really fucking good.

1172
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:15,162
Mmm. Ohh.

1173
01:16:15,287 --> 01:16:17,748
<i>Yeah, that hit was good.

1174
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:20,751
<i>I promised myself another one
before I got to London.

1175
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:24,254
<i>Just the one like.
For old time's sake.

1176
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:27,090
<i>Just to piss Begbie off.

1177
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:28,925
<i>This was his nightmare.

1178
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:31,762
<i>The dodgiest scam
in a lifetime of dodgy scams

1179
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:33,764
<i>being perpetrated with three
of the most useless

1180
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:37,434
<i>and unreliable fuck-ups
in town.

1181
01:16:37,559 --> 01:16:39,102
<i>I knew what was going on
in his mind.

1182
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:41,730
<i>Any trouble in London, and
he would dump us immediately.

1183
01:16:41,813 --> 01:16:42,814
<i>One way or another.

1184
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:44,274
<i>He had to.

1185
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:46,610
<i>If he got caught
with a bagful of scag,

1186
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:48,236
<i>on top of
that armed-robbery shit,

1187
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:50,947
<i>he was going down for 15 to 20.

1188
01:16:51,323 --> 01:16:53,200
<i>Begbie was hard,
but not so hard

1189
01:16:53,325 --> 01:16:56,286
<i>that he didn't shite it
off 20 years in Sultan.

1190
01:17:03,585 --> 01:17:06,129
<i>This was to be my final hit.

1191
01:17:06,254 --> 01:17:08,090
<i>But let's be clear about this.

1192
01:17:08,173 --> 01:17:11,259
<i>There's final hits
and final hits.

1193
01:17:11,343 --> 01:17:13,345
<i>What kind was this to be?

1194
01:17:18,392 --> 01:17:20,185
Did you bring the cards?

1195
01:17:20,477 --> 01:17:21,812
- What?
- The cards.

1196
01:17:21,895 --> 01:17:24,481
The last thing I told you
was to mind the cards.

1197
01:17:24,564 --> 01:17:26,691
Well, I've not brought them.

1198
01:17:28,693 --> 01:17:31,029
Fucking boring after a while
without the cards.

1199
01:17:31,154 --> 01:17:33,281
I'm sorry.

1200
01:17:33,365 --> 01:17:35,575
- Bit fucking late.
- Why didn't you bring them?

1201
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:39,413
'Cause I fucking told you
to bring them, you doss cunt!

1202
01:17:40,205 --> 01:17:41,415
Christ.

1203
01:18:28,837 --> 01:18:30,422
These are your friends, right?

1204
01:18:30,547 --> 01:18:33,592
These are the guys
I told you about.

1205
01:18:33,717 --> 01:18:36,094
- Well, is he here?
- Yeah, he's here.

1206
01:18:36,219 --> 01:18:38,096
You didn't get followed,
did you?

1207
01:18:38,221 --> 01:18:40,265
We didn't get followed.

1208
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:41,725
Okay.

1209
01:18:58,784 --> 01:18:59,951
All right.

1210
01:19:00,077 --> 01:19:01,244
Aye.

1211
01:19:03,914 --> 01:19:06,458
<i>Straightaway he clocked us
for what we were.

1212
01:19:06,583 --> 01:19:09,544
<i>Small-time wasters
with an accidental big deal.

1213
01:19:20,514 --> 01:19:22,224
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1214
01:20:15,569 --> 01:20:20,198
So how much would you like
for this?

1215
01:20:22,701 --> 01:20:24,286
20,000.

1216
01:20:25,954 --> 01:20:29,082
Well, I don't think it's worth
much more than  15,000.

1217
01:20:29,207 --> 01:20:31,001
<i>This was a real drag to him.

1218
01:20:31,084 --> 01:20:33,003
<i>He didn't need to negotiate.

1219
01:20:33,086 --> 01:20:35,338
<i>What the fuck were we going
to do if he didn't buy it?

1220
01:20:35,422 --> 01:20:38,091
<i>Sell it on the streets?
Fuck that!

1221
01:20:38,216 --> 01:20:40,010
Well,  19,000.

1222
01:20:40,093 --> 01:20:42,888
I'm terribly sorry.
I can't go to  19,000.

1223
01:20:45,557 --> 01:20:47,893
Well, fucking  16,000, then.

1224
01:20:49,936 --> 01:20:50,854
Okay.

1225
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:53,565
Well, fucking  16,000
it is, then.

1226
01:20:57,944 --> 01:21:01,239
These, gentlemen,
are 2,000 bundles.

1227
01:21:01,364 --> 01:21:04,117
Here's two.

1228
01:21:04,242 --> 01:21:05,952
That's four.

1229
01:21:06,078 --> 01:21:08,455
<i>We settled on 16, 000.

1230
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:12,334
<i>He had more in the suitcase,
but it was better than nothing.

1231
01:21:19,424 --> 01:21:21,968
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

1232
01:21:22,094 --> 01:21:24,679
I'd like to say it's been
a pleasure haggling with you.

1233
01:21:24,763 --> 01:21:27,015
Fucking brand-new,
by the way.

1234
01:21:29,476 --> 01:21:30,435
Okay.

1235
01:21:32,938 --> 01:21:34,981
- Yes!
- Yes!

1236
01:21:35,107 --> 01:21:36,483
Fucking...

1237
01:21:37,401 --> 01:21:40,153
<i>And just for a moment,
it felt really great.

1238
01:21:40,278 --> 01:21:42,155
<i>Like we were in it together,
like friends.

1239
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:43,740
<i>Like it meant something.

1240
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:46,326
<i>A moment like that
can touch you deep inside.

1241
01:21:46,451 --> 01:21:47,953
<i>But it doesn't last long,
not like 16, 000.

1242
01:21:47,953 --> 01:21:49,413
<i>But it doesn't last long,
not like 16, 000.

1243
01:21:49,538 --> 01:21:52,666
So what about you, Spud, any
investments on the horizon?

1244
01:21:52,791 --> 01:21:55,001
Gonna buy yourself
a wee island in the sun?

1245
01:21:55,127 --> 01:21:56,128
For four fucking grand?

1246
01:21:56,253 --> 01:22:00,298
One palm tree, a couple
of rocks, and a sewage outflow.

1247
01:22:01,216 --> 01:22:03,510
[Snorts]
I don't know, man.

1248
01:22:03,635 --> 01:22:06,096
I'm gonna get something
for my ma.

1249
01:22:06,179 --> 01:22:10,392
Get some good speed, no bicarb.

1250
01:22:10,475 --> 01:22:12,519
And get a girl, take her out,
treat her right.

1251
01:22:12,644 --> 01:22:13,603
Shag her senseless.

1252
01:22:13,729 --> 01:22:15,772
No, man!
True love.

1253
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:17,274
True love.

1254
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:18,775
Hey, but I could handle

1255
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:21,778
some hot sex
with a Jewish Princess.

1256
01:22:21,903 --> 01:22:23,947
- You daft cunt!
- Or a Catholic!

1257
01:22:24,072 --> 01:22:25,031
If you're gonna waste it
on a bird,

1258
01:22:25,157 --> 01:22:27,617
you may as well fucking
leave all of it to me.

1259
01:22:27,743 --> 01:22:29,119
Now get the drinks.

1260
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:32,372
- I got the last one.
- It's your round, Franco.

1261
01:22:33,915 --> 01:22:35,876
Okay.
Same again?

1262
01:22:36,001 --> 01:22:38,420
Right.
I'm off for a pish.

1263
01:22:38,503 --> 01:22:41,089
See when I get back
the money's still here, okay?

1264
01:22:41,173 --> 01:22:43,008
The moment your back's turned,
we're out the door.

1265
01:22:43,133 --> 01:22:44,718
I'll be right fucking after you.

1266
01:22:44,843 --> 01:22:47,471
You'll never catch us,
you flabby bastard.

1267
01:22:47,596 --> 01:22:49,848
By the way,
see when I get back.

1268
01:22:49,973 --> 01:22:52,476
Be halfway down the street
with the money.

1269
01:22:52,601 --> 01:22:53,977
Fucking kill you.

1270
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:56,313
I thought you might, Franco.

1271
01:22:56,438 --> 01:22:57,939
I thought you might.

1272
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:04,654
Are you game for it?

1273
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:06,281
What?

1274
01:23:07,991 --> 01:23:09,451
Well?

1275
01:23:10,535 --> 01:23:12,120
Are you serious?

1276
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:21,129
Don't know.

1277
01:23:21,213 --> 01:23:22,714
What do you think?

1278
01:23:24,049 --> 01:23:25,217
Still here, I see.

1279
01:23:25,342 --> 01:23:27,719
Oh, well, we wouldn't
run out on a mate, eh?

1280
01:23:27,844 --> 01:23:30,180
Why not?
I know I would.

1281
01:23:31,056 --> 01:23:32,724
Where's Franco?

1282
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:37,813
For fuck's sake!

1283
01:23:37,896 --> 01:23:39,106
Sorry, mate.

1284
01:23:39,231 --> 01:23:42,526
You ruined my fucking suit,
you fucking idiot.

1285
01:23:42,609 --> 01:23:44,069
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

1286
01:23:44,194 --> 01:23:46,238
Sorry's not gonna
dry me off, you cunt.

1287
01:23:46,363 --> 01:23:49,324
Cool down, Franco.
The man says he's sorry.

1288
01:23:49,408 --> 01:23:52,661
Not sorry enough
for being a fat cunt.

1289
01:23:52,744 --> 01:23:54,871
If you can't hold a pint,
you shouldn't be in the pub.

1290
01:23:54,996 --> 01:23:55,997
Fuck off.

1291
01:24:00,419 --> 01:24:02,129
Aah.

1292
01:24:02,254 --> 01:24:04,631
Oh! Oh, no!
Oh, no!

1293
01:24:11,972 --> 01:24:14,015
Come on, Franco, move away.
Aah!

1294
01:24:14,141 --> 01:24:16,518
Aah!
Fuck's sake!

1295
01:24:16,601 --> 01:24:19,104
Oh, fucking nice one, Franco!

1296
01:24:19,229 --> 01:24:20,897
- Shut it!
- You cut me, man!

1297
01:24:20,981 --> 01:24:23,066
You were in my fucking way.

1298
01:24:23,191 --> 01:24:24,484
Help!

1299
01:24:25,652 --> 01:24:26,987
Oh, no.

1300
01:24:27,112 --> 01:24:30,323
Anybody else want to get
in my fucking way?

1301
01:24:30,449 --> 01:24:31,658
You?

1302
01:24:34,077 --> 01:24:35,203
You?

1303
01:24:40,167 --> 01:24:45,589
Hey, Rent Boy, you bring me down
a fucking smoke.

1304
01:24:45,672 --> 01:24:48,633
- I think we'd better go, Franco!
- Go to the hospital!

1305
01:24:48,759 --> 01:24:52,512
You're not going to any fucking
hospital, and you're staying.

1306
01:24:55,515 --> 01:24:58,643
You bring me down
a fucking cigarette.

1307
01:25:04,441 --> 01:25:06,026
And the bag.
