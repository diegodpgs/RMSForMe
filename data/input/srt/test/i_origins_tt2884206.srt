1
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,823
<i>Every living person
on this planet</i>

2
00:00:57,825 --> 00:01:02,061
<i>has their own unique
pair of eyes,</i>

3
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:03,829
<i>each their own universe.</i>

4
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,711
<i>My name is Dr. Ian Gray.</i>

5
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:22,614
<i>I'm a father,</i>

6
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,750
<i>a husband</i>

7
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,152
<i>and I'm a scientist.</i>

8
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:37,196
<i>When I was a child,
I realized that the camera</i>

9
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:40,866
<i>was designed exactly like
the human eye,</i>

10
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:42,234
<i>taking in light
through a lens,</i>

11
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:45,471
<i>forming it into images.</i>

12
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:47,739
<i>I began taking
as many pictures of eyes</i>

13
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,541
<i>as I possibly could.</i>

14
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,864
<i>I'd like to tell you the story</i>

15
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:14,500
<i>of the eyes
that changed my world.</i>

16
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:16,602
<i>Remember these eyes.</i>

17
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:19,638
<i>Remember all the details
in these eyes.</i>

18
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,409
<i>Okay.</i>

19
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,854
<i>It started when I was
a 26-year-old PhD student</i>

20
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,422
<i>living in New York.</i>

21
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:40,626
<i>It was Halloween,
eight years ago.</i>

22
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,698
You okay?

23
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,304
I'm watching the moon.

24
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,915
Can I take a picture
of your eyes?

25
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,951
Why?

26
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,555
It's just something I do.

27
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,761
Okay.
Yeah?

28
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,730
I've perfected this.

29
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,658
Hi.

30
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,940
Hi.

31
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:25,530
Do you know the story
of the Phasianidae?

32
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,266
The... No.

33
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:28,567
What's that?

34
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,402
It's a bird...

35
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:33,905
that experiences all of time
in one instant.

36
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:37,442
And she sings the song
of love and anger

37
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,611
and fear and joy
and sadness

38
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,947
all at once...

39
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,717
all combined
into one magnificent sound.

40
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,452
Where are you from?

41
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,555
Another planet.

42
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:54,593
What does the bird
sound like?

43
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:56,528
It sounds like this.

44
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,563
Lean closer.

45
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,502
Geez...

46
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,037
It's more like noise.

47
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,005
Yeah.

48
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,545
And this bird...

49
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:16,915
when she meets the
love of her life,

50
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:20,585
is both happy and sad.

51
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:24,990
Happy because she sees that,
for him, it is the beginning,

52
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:29,361
and sad because she knows
it is already over.

53
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:44,076
Hey, hey, do you want
to get a drink?

54
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:45,744
I don't drink.

55
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:50,982
Like, anything?

56
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,698
You're not gonna regret this
in the morning, right?

57
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,961
Your identity confirmed.

58
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:53,705
I finished that
transcription factor program.

59
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,810
Last night?

60
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,645
No.

61
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,147
This morning.

62
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,650
'Cause, bitch, I don't play.

63
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,052
Got the input genes,
and then you put

64
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:08,220
your transcription factor...
Wait a minute.

65
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:10,889
You... stink of vodka.

66
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,624
I mean, like, bad.
Like, it smells...

67
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,793
Yeah, I know, I know
I reek off vodka.

68
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:16,228
Stop talking so loud.

69
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,096
Okay, I consolidated
all your data

70
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,798
into one database.

71
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,199
You are welcome.

72
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,068
You're amazing.
I hate you.

73
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,237
Well, I love you...
that's why I do it.

74
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:26,505
Oh, hey.

75
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:29,174
You got a new rotating student.

76
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,642
It's a first-year.

77
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,644
Oh, sh...
Yeah.

78
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:33,879
Yeah. Yeah.

79
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,947
Have fun
babysitting, buddy.

80
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,516
You need gum.

81
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:41,119
You need...
to have fun babysitting.

82
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:44,122
Karen.
Hi. Ian.

83
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,824
Can I...?

84
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,234
Follow me.

85
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,105
<i>You're attempting to make</i>

86
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:02,674
- color-blind mice see color?
- That's the idea.

87
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,676
But after failed experiment

88
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:06,945
352...

89
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,146
we'll see.

90
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,314
Why?

91
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:10,949
Why what?

92
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,285
Do so many experiments fail?

93
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:17,055
Why are you interested in making
color-blind mice see color?

94
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,757
Oh...

95
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,325
Why not?

96
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:23,295
How are you testing
that they see color?

97
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,798
As the new rotating
lab assistant,

98
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,968
your job will be
to do very boring,

99
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,037
very repetitive
experiments,

100
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,706
be a glorified note taker,

101
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,841
and not ask me "why"
every five minutes.

102
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:37,976
Okay?

103
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,177
Cool.

104
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,046
Commencing experiment...

105
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:43,715
3-5-3,

106
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:46,651
response to photo pigment
protein in<i> Mus musculus.</i>

107
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,220
The control subjects
B Beta,

108
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,256
G Gamma,

109
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,725
E Euphoria,

110
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,026
P...

111
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,861
Psychopannychia.

112
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,630
I don't know what that means.

113
00:09:58,632 --> 00:09:59,632
Look it up.

114
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:00,799
"G" as in
goodness gracious,

115
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:03,301
"H" as in help me, please,

116
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,003
"Z" as in Zoolander,

117
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,938
are the mice muted

118
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,675
with the photo
pigment protein.

119
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,177
When we animate
the lines...

120
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:14,112
color-blind mice

121
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,315
stare straight.

122
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,317
Whereas...

123
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:22,253
fingers crossed...

124
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,823
the muted mice... shh...

125
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:30,028
...track the lines
with their eyes.

126
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,963
Holy shit.
Holy fucking shit.

127
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,832
Is this on the background

128
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:36,134
of PAX6 overexpression?

129
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,738
You're a first-year?

130
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,707
I know... it's surprising
I can put together a sentence.

131
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:45,877
Sorry, I... I asked
my last three lab assistants

132
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,313
not to come in
and I'd sign their credits.

133
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,683
Anyway,
this is just one step

134
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:55,320
in a very, very long... process.

135
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:58,156
This is a rough estimation,

136
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,191
but let's just say
that the human eye

137
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,260
has 12 working parts, right?

138
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,095
Simplest eye having one.

139
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,231
So if we can
fill in the gaps...

140
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,332
the evolutionary gaps...

141
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,835
using single mutations,

142
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:14,039
we can map out
the most logical progression

143
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,274
of the most basic eye...

144
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:20,278
to the most complex,
fully formed human eye.

145
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,914
I don't understand...
why take the time?

146
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,916
We know that it evolved.

147
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,686
It's an assumption;
it's not a fact.

148
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:31,322
When you're no longer
a first-year, you'll see

149
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,091
how important facts are.

150
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,793
Right.

151
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:40,331
Each of these animals has an eye

152
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,001
that's best selected
for its environment.

153
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,071
It would be...

154
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,006
cleaner... less variables...

155
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:50,408
if you... had an origin.

156
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,178
Go on.

157
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,246
You start with one...

158
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,748
to get to 12.

159
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,017
But what if you had zero...

160
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,252
a non-seeing organism...

161
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:04,322
and built, genetically,
an eye from scratch,

162
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,157
a zero to 12?

163
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,127
It'd be a perfect proof,
unassailable.

164
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:12,997
Non-seeing organisms
don't have the PAX6 gene.

165
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:16,167
How do you know? Has anyone
ever checked all of them?

166
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:19,738
I don't think anyone
has ever checked...

167
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,272
all of them.

168
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,843
You've thought of this before?

169
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,378
Why did you look surprised?

170
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,781
Because so have you.

171
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,453
Okay.

172
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,294
Who were those girls?

173
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:47,365
Which girls?
The ones at the
Halloween party

174
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,400
in the S&M outfits.

175
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,236
S&M outfits...?

176
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,538
I-I met one of them;
I don't know her name.

177
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,508
I don't know her face, but
she had these most amazing eyes.

178
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,910
So specific.

179
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,178
Central heterochromia.

180
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,514
Oh, reminds me.

181
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:04,382
Guess what I did.

182
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:05,850
What?

183
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,919
I... figured out an improved

184
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,220
implementation technique

185
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:12,357
for Daugman's
biometrics algo.

186
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:14,459
You ever feel like
when you met someone,

187
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,060
they fill this hole
inside of you,

188
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,362
and then when they're gone...

189
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:21,299
you feel that space
painfully vacant?

190
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,269
Are you okay, man?

191
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,173
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

192
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:29,407
Are you okay?

193
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,576
What did you just say?
Did you just...

194
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:33,578
The way you talked was,
like, poetic.

195
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,880
It was weird.
Shut the fuck up.

196
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:38,016
So weird, dude,
I can't believe...

197
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,851
Oh, shit.

198
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,389
This guy is painfully vacant.

199
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,391
Ian, look at him...
he's so painfully va...

200
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:49,994
He's so painfully vacant.

201
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,197
Fuck off.

202
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,072
Can I get a-a pack of Verdict

203
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,241
and a Powerball?

204
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:08,112
How much is that?

205
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:11,983
$11.11.

206
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,184
Eleven...

207
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,360
Lucky elevens.

208
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,299
Thanks.

209
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:12,196
Karen.
Mm-hmm?

210
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,198
What are you doing?

211
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,667
Five percent of all animals
don't have vision,

212
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,037
and there are
8.7 million species.

213
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,773
So I blasted PAX6
at the database,

214
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:23,508
but nothing came up.

215
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,143
So I started sequencing
by myself.

216
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,245
How many did you sequence?

217
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,816
12.
You've done 12.

218
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:35,219
So how many do
you have left?

219
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:39,323
Like, approximately
426,000.

220
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:43,628
Are you going to write
426,000 names

221
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,396
on the window?

222
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,835
I'm going to find it before
I get to the end of the window.

223
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,203
Okay.

224
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,172
What are you doing?

225
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,542
I'm... I'm not doing anything.

226
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:50,695
You know we could be looking
forever and find nothing.

227
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:55,399
Turning over rocks
and finding nothing is progress.

228
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,059
<i>So, are you gonna tell me
where you're from?</i>

229
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,996
So many places, I don't know.

230
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:42,500
Which places?

231
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:44,802
Mm...

232
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:48,673
To make it short,
I was born in Argentina,

233
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:52,510
and when I was 11, I moved
to France with my grandmother.

234
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,383
And your-your parents?

235
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,420
Next.

236
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:09,026
So, what do you do?

237
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:10,461
Next.

238
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,337
Why did you sleep
with me that night?

239
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,873
Poor judgment.

240
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,713
I was lonely
for a long time, and...

241
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,684
...when I saw you that night,

242
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:37,555
I... I had the feeling
that I had known you.

243
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:40,958
Actually, I felt like
you knew me.

244
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,428
What do you mean?

245
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,599
Like we are connected
from past lives.

246
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,069
I don't believe in that.

247
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:56,774
What do you believe in?

248
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:59,443
I'm a scientist;
I believe in data.

249
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:00,878
A scientist?
Mm-hmm.

250
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,480
What kind of scientist?

251
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:03,781
Molecular biology.

252
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:06,517
I'm most fascinated
with the eye.

253
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,985
The eye... the-the eyes?

254
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,120
The eyes.
Why the eye?

255
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:10,788
The eye is

256
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,790
the one sticking point
that religious people use

257
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:15,059
to discredit evolution.

258
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:18,129
They use it as proof of a...
intelligent designer.

259
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:19,964
Intelligent designer...?

260
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,732
God.

261
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:25,436
I'm looking to end the debate
once and for all with...

262
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,474
...clear, clean facts.

263
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:32,610
Data points of every stage
of eye evolution.

264
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:36,614
Why are you working so hard
to disprove God?

265
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:39,784
Disprove? Who proved that God
was there in the first place?

266
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:45,489
Anyway,
let's get some real

267
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:47,124
data points on you, okay?

268
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,559
Be my guest.

269
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:51,195
I prefer talking
about myself anyways.

270
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:53,097
Okay.

271
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,966
<i>Um, what's your favorite,
um...</i>

272
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:58,436
<i>Candy?</i>

273
00:23:58,438 --> 00:23:59,637
<i>Strawberry Mentos.</i>

274
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:01,739
<i>Food?</i>

275
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:03,707
<i>Veggie burritos.</i>

276
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:05,075
<i>I'm vegetarian,
you should know that.</i>

277
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:09,046
<i>What's your favorite flower?</i>

278
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:11,115
<i>Dandelions.</i>

279
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:13,050
<i>Okay. Why?</i>

280
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:16,220
<i>'Cause, they're free, wild,</i>

281
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:18,656
<i>and you can't buy them.</i>

282
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:21,192
<i>What's your favorite
field of study?</i>

283
00:24:21,194 --> 00:24:22,760
<i>The stars.</i>

284
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:24,628
<i>What's your favorite animal?</i>

285
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,996
<i>The white peacock.</i>

286
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,965
<i>You ever see one?</i>

287
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,467
<i>No.</i>

288
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:30,801
<i>There's one in New York.</i>

289
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:33,237
<i>I'll take you to see it.</i>

290
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:36,540
<i>So, you're gonna see me again?</i>

291
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,008
<i>Maybe.</i>

292
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:51,789
<i>You know,
in Indian mythology,</i>

293
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,724
<i>the white peacock symbolizes</i>

294
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:56,760
<i>souls being dispersed
throughout the world.</i>

295
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:59,196
<i>Did you ever think
it just symbolizes</i>

296
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:02,132
<i>a lack of melanin or pigment
in the cells?</i>

297
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,704
<i>The control subjects "T..."</i>

298
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:09,106
<i>"T" as in tsunami.</i>

299
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,574
<i>"G" as in...</i>

300
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:11,576
<i>Gnome.</i>

301
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:13,077
<i>"P" as in...</i>

302
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,912
<i>Pneumonia.</i>

303
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:16,080
<i>"M" as in...</i>

304
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:17,281
<i>Mnemonic.</i>

305
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,209
I start to see these elevens,
like, everywhere.

306
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,911
Too many elevens.

307
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:50,281
The amount was
so staggering, so unlikely,

308
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:53,150
that I followed them.

309
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,619
And when I followed them,
I found your eyes,

310
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:58,055
which then led me to you.

311
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,291
Because I found you
through your eyes.

312
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:03,060
Also unlikely...

313
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,162
like life itself.

314
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:08,799
I know.

315
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:10,801
I sent them to you.

316
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,770
Bullshit.

317
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,842
You know you have it.

318
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:21,084
Have what?
But you're scared of it.

319
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,249
I have what?

320
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,358
Okay.

321
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,031
You live in this room, right?

322
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,199
Mm-hmm.

323
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,134
Reality.

324
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:47,805
You have a bed, you have books,

325
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:51,675
um, a desk, a chair, lamps.

326
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:54,144
Logic.

327
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,980
But in this room,

328
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:58,716
you have a door...

329
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:00,050
to the other side.

330
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,988
See?

331
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,358
Light comes through.

332
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,259
It's open

333
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:14,231
just a tiny bit,
but it is open.

334
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:18,202
You keep trying to close
that door because you're scared.

335
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:23,140
But you won't always
be scared.

336
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,345
What's behind the door?

337
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:30,214
Besides my dirty laundry.

338
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:32,776
You have to go
in to find out.

339
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,953
You know
what I'm talking about.

340
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,292
I have no idea.

341
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:44,795
You will.

342
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:46,764
You will.

343
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,867
Oh...

344
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:52,136
You want to move to my place?

345
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:53,671
You have a place?

346
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:56,006
Mm-hmm. Of course.

347
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,676
Can I move in tomorrow?

348
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,145
Is this your family?

349
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:37,114
Yes, it's my grandmother.

350
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,151
Such an eccentric beauty.

351
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:44,221
And...

352
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,893
...my parents and me
when I was a baby.

353
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,997
Um, the white peacock.

354
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:56,867
But you have
met him before.

355
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:58,969
Mm!

356
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:02,306
This is a proof
of the spirit world.

357
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:04,341
"El Ángel de la Resurreccion."

358
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:06,009
What?

359
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:08,345
It's the name of the statue,
of the statue

360
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:10,080
in St. Anne's Cemetery.

361
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,315
It's in
St. Anne's Cemetery?

362
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:12,850
Mm-hmm.

363
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:15,152
But look at the eyes.

364
00:29:15,154 --> 00:29:17,821
They're alive.

365
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:19,423
Yeah.

366
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,825
It's amazing what you can do
on Photoshop these days.

367
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:24,061
There's no Photoshop!

368
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:29,066
The eyes appeared
just when she took the picture.

369
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:30,334
Just...

370
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:32,770
You're so beautiful.

371
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:34,204
Let's get more boxes.

372
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:44,114
19 days gestation period.

373
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,850
She is ready.

374
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:50,120
Fame, science grants,

375
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:53,791
fortune await you.

376
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:56,493
If you find that PAX6 gene,

377
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:58,896
we'll be well on our way
to all of that.

378
00:29:58,898 --> 00:30:02,533
Recognition makes me
extremely nauseous.

379
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,971
Well, it is important
that people know about the work.

380
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:12,810
To me, the best thing about
living like a lab rat...

381
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:15,946
is that sometimes...

382
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:18,182
really rare times,

383
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:21,585
you actually
discover something.

384
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:27,224
On the night of a discovery,
when you're lying in bed,

385
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:31,028
you are the only person in
the world that knows it's true.

386
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:46,910
Can you promise
me something?

387
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,545
Promise you something?
Mm-hmm.

388
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:50,180
What?

389
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,882
Promise.

390
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:53,550
I can't promise
if you don't tell me what...

391
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,052
Promise first.

392
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:57,955
Before you tell me
what it is?
Mm-hmm.

393
00:30:57,957 --> 00:31:00,390
I keep my promises.

394
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:02,860
Whatever, I won't tell.

395
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,628
Promise.

396
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,233
Okay, I promise.

397
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:11,101
I want you to burn me.

398
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:12,436
Burn you?

399
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:14,504
I don't want to rot
in a box when I die.

400
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:16,874
Oh, you mean like
cremate you.

401
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:17,975
Mm, yeah.

402
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,276
Oh, no, no.

403
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:20,878
I don't want to be cremated.

404
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:27,184
This is a big disagreement
I didn't know we had.

405
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:29,953
Cremation
is like obliteration.

406
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:32,422
I mean, what if in the future,
the scientists...

407
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:36,660
what if they can reconstitute
ourselves through our DNA?

408
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:39,429
I want to be clear with you.

409
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:41,198
Hmm?
I don't want that.

410
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,033
You don't want what?

411
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:44,968
I don't want to be cloning.

412
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,103
"Cl-Cloneed." Cl...

413
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:47,437
"I don't want to be cloning."

414
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:50,374
"Cloneed."

415
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:53,343
No, but I'd reconstitute
myself first,

416
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:55,545
and then I'd reconstitute you,
and then I'd ask you,

417
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:57,648
"Do you want to be alive?"

418
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,550
And then if you didn't,
I'd kill you.

419
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,226
No, but then we could be
together forever, like, like,

420
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:11,495
for real, scientifically.
You can't do...

421
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:13,597
Reanimated, reconstituted.

422
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,068
You have a hard time
letting go.

423
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,704
Don't worry.

424
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:23,307
We'll find each other again.

425
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:36,219
I love your smell.

426
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:37,955
What is it?

427
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:39,323
I won't tell.

428
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:40,457
Come on, tell me.

429
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:43,627
Mm-mm. Mm.

430
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,098
Will you marry me?

431
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,544
Next?

432
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:02,045
Can I help you?

433
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:03,347
We'd like to get married.

434
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:04,548
Do you have
your I.D.'s?

435
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,550
Yeah.
Yes.

436
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:13,123
Okay, first you have
to get your marriage license,

437
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,291
so you have to
fill these out.

438
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:15,459
Okay.
Okay.

439
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:17,995
You're gonna have
to wait 24 hours

440
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:19,529
before you can
actually get married.

441
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:20,697
24 hours?!

442
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,065
Yeah.
Why?

443
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:23,533
Well, this way,
you have 24 hours

444
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:25,502
to decide whether you want
to marry this young man.

445
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,270
But I want
to marry him!

446
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:29,706
In 24 hours.

447
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:32,275
So...
Okay. All right. Yeah.

448
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:35,479
So we can't get married today.

449
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:38,782
Okay...

450
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,153
This system really...

451
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:46,390
kills the spontaneity
factor, huh?

452
00:33:46,392 --> 00:33:48,692
We're already married
in the spirit world.

453
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,195
Shit.

454
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,430
Hello?

455
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:54,564
Hi.

456
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:55,566
Hi.

457
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:57,267
Hi.

458
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:59,536
Hi. What's up?
You called, like, five times.

459
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,771
I did.

460
00:34:00,773 --> 00:34:02,806
Why-why would I do that?

461
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:04,808
Why might I call five times?

462
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,443
I don't know.

463
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:08,311
I was running the
electrophoretic drill...

464
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:10,313
you know,
just another Tuesday...

465
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:12,349
and I started
sequencing the genes

466
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:16,153
of this strange worm
called<i> Eisenia fetida.</i>

467
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:17,554
Go on.

468
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,456
And, uh...

469
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:22,292
I-I found the PAX6
master switch.

470
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,228
No.

471
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,397
Yeah.
Are you serious right now?

472
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,633
You fucking with me?
Do you know what this means?

473
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:31,301
We found an origin species,

474
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:33,470
and we can build
an eye from scratch.

475
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:36,306
Holy sh...!

476
00:34:38,177 --> 00:34:40,477
Um, uh, does it...
does it have

477
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:42,345
the same amino acid sequence
as humans?

478
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:43,513
I-I can't even...

479
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:44,815
I can't even talk right now.

480
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:46,616
I feel like
I'm gonna piss myself.

481
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:48,085
Can you just come in here?

482
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:49,219
Okay, I'm coming in right now.

483
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:50,221
You're amazing.

484
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:51,855
Bye. Bye-bye. Bye.

485
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,392
Who was that?

486
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:56,860
That was Karen, uh...

487
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:58,261
my rotating...

488
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,464
well... my lab partner.

489
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:04,501
I have to go into
the lab, right now.

490
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:07,504
Do you want to come with me?
On our wedding day?

491
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,407
It's... well, it's not...

492
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:12,609
technically,
it's not our wedding day today.

493
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,845
And we've been
married... forever

494
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:17,114
in the spiritual world, right?

495
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:19,249
Sofi, please,
come in with me.

496
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:20,450
It's really important.

497
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,685
Sure.

498
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:23,553
Yeah?

499
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:25,622
Mm. It's fine.
Let's go.

500
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,291
Well, d... don't
be upset about it.

501
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,160
Let's put our rings on.

502
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:31,728
I don't want to;
it's bad luck.

503
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,730
I don't believe in luck.

504
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,200
I do believe we've
known each other

505
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:40,170
since forever, though.

506
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:41,438
Really?

507
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,807
Yeah.
You know how?

508
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,410
When the big bang
happened,

509
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:49,913
all the atoms in the universe,
they were all smashed together

510
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:52,883
into one little dot
that exploded outward.

511
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:56,219
So my atoms and your atoms
were certainly together then,

512
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:57,721
and, who knows, probably...

513
00:35:57,723 --> 00:36:01,424
smashed together several
times in the last 13.7

514
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:03,727
billion years.

515
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:07,297
So my atoms have
known your atoms...

516
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:10,400
and they've always
known your atoms.

517
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:13,637
My atoms have...
always loved your atoms.

518
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,446
Let's go.

519
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,322
Karen.

520
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:38,428
Hey.
Hi.

521
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,864
Hi. This is...
Sofi, this is Karen.

522
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:42,532
Karen, this is Sofi.
Hi.

523
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,568
She's my wife.

524
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:47,804
Welcome. Um...

525
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:50,640
What do you want to see?

526
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:51,808
I want to see
everything.

527
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,876
Uh...

528
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:55,245
So, I have this gel.

529
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:58,348
And it aligns?

530
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,551
The alignment crossed
PAX6 proteins...

531
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:04,221
98% identity.

532
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:06,456
Are these the worms?

533
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,461
They-they can't see anything.

534
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:14,264
Not for long.

535
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:35,252
You know, um...

536
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:37,787
I should... I'm gonna
go take a shower.

537
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,923
You've seen it.

538
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:42,425
I should... take a shower,
Shower?

539
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,728
brush my teeth...
Wait a minute,
you're gonna go

540
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,630
right now?
Um... yeah.

541
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:50,600
Yeah, I'm sure you want to show
your wife around the lab and...

542
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,669
Okay. Are you sure?

543
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,539
Okay. Well, uh...

544
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:58,541
this is amazing.

545
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:00,043
The beginning
of something...

546
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:01,745
amazing.

547
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,417
It was nice
to meet you.

548
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:10,020
Amazing stuff, Karen.

549
00:38:10,022 --> 00:38:11,588
Bye.
Bye.

550
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,956
Bye.

551
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,476
What's wrong?

552
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,048
I know something's
wrong, so...

553
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,651
You leave me every day
to torture little worms?

554
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:49,359
We're not torturing
worms... Sofi.

555
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:51,061
If you're interested,

556
00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:53,430
we're modifying organisms.

557
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:56,333
In this case,
they happen to be worms,

558
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:57,867
that are blind,

559
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,602
and we're modifying them
to have vision.

560
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:03,373
You can make blind worms see?

561
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,974
Kind of.

562
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:07,043
I mean, we can now, maybe.

563
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:10,547
You think that's a good idea?

564
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:13,550
Do you think it's a bad idea?

565
00:39:13,552 --> 00:39:15,485
I think...

566
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:18,054
it's dangerous to play God.

567
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:21,124
Sofi, I believe
in proof.

568
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:24,027
There is no proof

569
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:27,530
that there is
some magical spirit...

570
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,367
uh, that's invisible,
living above us,

571
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:31,768
right on top of us...

572
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,537
How many senses do worms have?

573
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,439
They have two:

574
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:37,941
smell...

575
00:39:37,943 --> 00:39:39,476
and touch.

576
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:40,643
Why?

577
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:42,579
So...

578
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:45,048
they live without
any ability to see

579
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,385
or even know about light, right?

580
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:51,388
The notion of light
to them is...

581
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,756
unimaginable.

582
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:55,792
Yeah.

583
00:39:55,794 --> 00:39:56,993
But...

584
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:59,062
we humans...

585
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:01,598
we know...

586
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,634
that light exists...

587
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:06,770
all around them,

588
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:09,806
right on top of them.

589
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:11,975
They cannot
sense it, but...

590
00:40:11,977 --> 00:40:14,677
with a little mutation, they do.

591
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,045
Right?

592
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:17,881
Correct.

593
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,018
So...

594
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,788
Dr. Eye...

595
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,790
perhaps some humans...

596
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:28,491
rare humans...

597
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:31,995
have mutated to have
another sense...

598
00:40:31,997 --> 00:40:34,964
a spirit sense...

599
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:37,033
and can perceive a world

600
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:39,502
that is right
on top of us...

601
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:41,971
everywhere...

602
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:45,942
just... like the light
on these worms.

603
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:54,150
So you're a mutant.

604
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:56,119
Mm-hmm.

605
00:40:57,188 --> 00:41:00,156
And I'm not the only one.

606
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:17,740
Aah! Oh, sh...

607
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:19,609
Jesus!
Are you okay?
Here, let me see.

608
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:22,011
I got formaldehyde in my eye.
Get the splash kit.

609
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:23,746
What is it?
Aah! Fuck!

610
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:26,249
What is it? Tell me!
It's-it's... yellow!

611
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:27,884
It's right over there.

612
00:41:27,886 --> 00:41:30,687
It's yellow. Call Karen.
Fucking call Karen now.

613
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:32,889
Where's the number!
The number's
by the door.

614
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,824
By the door.

615
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:37,727
Got it.

616
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:49,038
We should do this
every Friday.

617
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,210
How many fingers
am I holding up?

618
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:58,081
12.
He's not blind.

619
00:41:58,083 --> 00:41:59,616
So that's good.

620
00:41:59,618 --> 00:42:01,050
I think you're gonna be fine.

621
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:02,285
Are you okay?

622
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:04,834
Yeah.

623
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,091
Okay.

624
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:10,527
Thank you.
Yeah.

625
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:12,529
You're gonna feel fine in...

626
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:14,197
12 hours or something.

627
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,199
I'll call tomorrow
and check in on him.

628
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,635
Thank you.
Yeah, of course.

629
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:38,087
This is funny.

630
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:41,758
Yeah. It's, um...

631
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,327
...strange.

632
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,897
Find me.

633
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:51,234
Whoa.

634
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:54,604
Whoa what?

635
00:42:58,643 --> 00:43:00,910
We are in the middle
of two floors.

636
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,645
We stopped.

637
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:05,315
Hmm.

638
00:43:05,317 --> 00:43:06,950
Hmm.

639
00:43:06,952 --> 00:43:08,918
We should call the super.

640
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,086
The super what?

641
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,155
The super.
The superintendent. Um,

642
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:13,890
the guy that fixes
the building.

643
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:15,592
Can you call him?

644
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:18,795
I don't know this guy.
I don't have his number.

645
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:20,797
Of course you don't.

646
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:21,931
Here.

647
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,736
It's under "super."

648
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:28,838
What?

649
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,873
Your phone is dead.

650
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:33,343
It's dead?
Yeah.

651
00:43:33,345 --> 00:43:35,878
Now, come on, relax.

652
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,314
You're so irresponsible.

653
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:40,917
Okay...

654
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:50,259
Want me to call Karen?

655
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,666
Don't be a child.

656
00:43:57,868 --> 00:44:00,937
You live in this
fairy, magical...

657
00:44:00,939 --> 00:44:03,973
fantasy land.

658
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,209
It's a fucking lie,
and you know it's a lie.

659
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:07,944
That's...

660
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:10,947
it's a lie that you want
to believe, like a child.

661
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:12,229
Like a child.

662
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:33,870
Okay. Okay.

663
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:35,438
Come on.

664
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,907
What's gonna happen?
I got... I'll boost you up.

665
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:39,842
No, no, no, you go first,
Come on.

666
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,277
and you pull me up.
Sofi, come on...

667
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:43,112
I'm not going first.
You go first.

668
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:45,674
Look at you.
You're so scared. Come on.

669
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:50,086
Be careful.

670
00:44:50,088 --> 00:44:51,821
Look how easy that was.

671
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:53,089
Come on.

672
00:44:53,091 --> 00:44:55,091
Come on, let's go.

673
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:58,094
Sofia, come on!

674
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:03,733
Give me your hand.

675
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:07,770
Give me your hand.

676
00:45:07,772 --> 00:45:09,105
Oh...

677
00:45:09,107 --> 00:45:10,387
Okay, come on.

678
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:45,742
Sofi?

679
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:54,150
Sofi? Sofi?

680
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:58,054
Sofi? Sofi?

681
00:45:58,056 --> 00:45:59,489
Sofi?

682
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:05,161
Sofi!

683
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,408
Hello?

684
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,610
Can I come over?

685
00:48:34,612 --> 00:48:36,312
No.

686
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,082
Maybe.

687
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:41,918
What if I bring you something

688
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,020
that I know will
take your breath away.

689
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:50,593
It has an eye.

690
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:53,195
I mean, just
light-sensitive cells, but...

691
00:48:53,197 --> 00:48:54,397
we did it.

692
00:48:54,399 --> 00:48:56,632
Mutations are holding.

693
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:59,936
You did it.

694
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:06,509
That's the first step in
a really long process.

695
00:49:06,511 --> 00:49:08,511
It's gonna end
as a worm in a box

696
00:49:08,513 --> 00:49:10,947
if you don't get your ass
back in the lab.

697
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:18,354
Why don't you
eat something.

698
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:08,731
<i>He claims to have
put to rest the notion</i>

699
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:12,501
<i>that the eye was made
by an intelligent designer.</i>

700
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:14,737
Dr. Gray, you made some mutants
in a laboratory,

701
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:16,839
and now you expect
all religious people

702
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:19,408
to what, just
throw away their beliefs?

703
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,410
Well, I... I expect
them to fight me

704
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,112
every step of the way.

705
00:51:23,114 --> 00:51:24,613
But I do implore them to look

706
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:27,383
at the evidence and data
that we've collected here.

707
00:51:27,385 --> 00:51:29,785
These specimens are
practical examples

708
00:51:29,787 --> 00:51:32,488
of every stage of
eye development.

709
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:33,856
Dr. Ian Gray, uh,
thanks for being here.

710
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:35,257
Thanks for having me.

711
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:37,860
Uh, the book is
<i>The Complete Eye.</i>

712
00:51:37,862 --> 00:51:39,562
All right.

713
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:45,401
How'd I do?

714
00:51:45,403 --> 00:51:47,136
Why do you do
that thing with your face?

715
00:51:47,138 --> 00:51:48,437
What-what do you...?

716
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,206
That thing where you're,
like...

717
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:53,275
You did nothing with your face.
It was good,
it was good.

718
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:54,643
Man, you should have joined

719
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:56,812
the private sector, Professor.

720
00:51:56,814 --> 00:51:59,548
It's-it's crazy.
Iris biometrics is...

721
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:02,151
exploding
all over the world.

722
00:52:02,153 --> 00:52:04,520
I'll take love over
money any day.

723
00:52:04,522 --> 00:52:06,755
Wow, that's...
that's mature of you.

724
00:52:06,757 --> 00:52:09,525
You think I could
really get a job there?

725
00:52:11,129 --> 00:52:12,862
Thank you.

726
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:18,868
You all right?

727
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:20,703
Any more drinks?

728
00:52:20,705 --> 00:52:22,805
Uh, yeah, I just...

729
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:24,840
there's a smell,
I can't place it.

730
00:52:24,842 --> 00:52:27,543
Maybe it's your perfume.

731
00:52:27,545 --> 00:52:29,478
Any more drinks?

732
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,314
Uh, no, actually,
we'd like to know

733
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:34,316
what your perfume is?
You don't
have to answer that.

734
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,252
I'm, I'm ju...
It's Trésor.

735
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:37,586
Trésor?

736
00:52:37,588 --> 00:52:40,456
- It's lovely.
- Thank you.

737
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:42,892
I'm okay with... drink.

738
00:52:42,894 --> 00:52:44,493
It's Trésor.

739
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:45,594
It's French.

740
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:46,929
Are you hitting
on the...

741
00:52:46,931 --> 00:52:50,332
waitress in front
of your pregnant wife?

742
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:51,901
I don't know if you know this
about me, Kenny,

743
00:52:51,903 --> 00:52:54,370
but the gene for jealousy...
recessive.

744
00:52:54,372 --> 00:52:56,205
That's... that's
good, for him.

745
00:52:56,207 --> 00:52:59,742
I'm going to the dance floor
with my pregnant, lovely wife.

746
00:52:59,744 --> 00:53:01,777
I'm gonna get
her number for you.

747
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:03,946
Please. Thank you.

748
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,784
I'm so looking forward

749
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:11,654
to brainwashing
this child with you.

750
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,658
You know what
I was thinking?

751
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:16,892
What?

752
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:24,233
What if we turn
the garage into a lab?

753
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:28,604
And the baby could be
our first test subject.

754
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,310
That's a great idea.

755
00:53:34,312 --> 00:53:36,812
Is there something
ethically wrong with that?

756
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,284
No.

757
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:52,394
You know what
I want to do?

758
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:55,864
I think we should leave.

759
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,855
I'm, uh, picking up
a prescription

760
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:22,391
for my wife, Karen Gray.

761
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:41,777
How about if I sing to you?

762
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:47,516
¶ Beautiful dreamer ¶

763
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:52,321
¶ Wake unto me... ¶

764
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:07,336
¶ Sounds of the rude world ¶

765
00:55:07,338 --> 00:55:09,438
¶ Heard in the day ¶

766
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,875
¶ Lull'd by the moonlight ¶

767
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:14,977
¶ Have all pass'd away... ¶

768
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:18,514
<i>Shh...</i>

769
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:25,421
¶ Beautiful dreamer ¶

770
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:27,589
¶ Wake unto me ¶

771
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:32,728
¶ Starlight and dewdrops ¶

772
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,963
¶ Are waiting for thee... ¶

773
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:49,345
¶ Say hello to the camera. ¶

774
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,682
Sofi, come on.

775
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:56,051
Be nice.

776
00:55:56,053 --> 00:55:58,420
Be nice.
Come on, act like a lady.

777
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:02,624
Hello.
Hello.

778
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:05,594
Hello.
I want you.

779
00:56:05,596 --> 00:56:07,830
I want you more.

780
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,014
Don't stop.

781
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:31,854
I want to know
what's turning you on.

782
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:53,367
I-I...
I never do this.

783
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:15,431
I sometimes think about
the cause and effect of it,

784
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:19,034
and I think about how... and
I don't feel guilty for this...

785
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:21,937
...but I think about how

786
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:25,841
if I hadn't called you
into the lab that day...

787
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,778
...she would...
maybe still be here,

788
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,681
and you would be with her.

789
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:38,987
Can I tell you something that
makes me feel like a monster?

790
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:44,493
That day in
the elevator,

791
00:57:44,495 --> 00:57:47,496
Am I going to be stuck

792
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:50,899
with this child
the rest of my life?

793
00:57:50,901 --> 00:57:54,236
And then the next moment,
she was dead.

794
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:59,875
We were never gonna be...
together, Karen.

795
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,911
I just never got...

796
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:04,646
closure.

797
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:07,082
I never got to say...

798
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:09,051
good-bye.

799
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,725
Kiss me.

800
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:49,224
Iris scanning is a new
identification measure taken up

801
00:58:49,226 --> 00:58:51,226
by the more sophisticated
hospitals.

802
00:58:51,228 --> 00:58:53,061
We-we know
what iris scanning is.

803
00:58:53,063 --> 00:58:55,731
We've had it in our lab
for a... for a decade.

804
00:58:55,733 --> 00:58:58,567
Well, it's still new
to the general public.

805
00:58:58,569 --> 00:59:01,270
Now, we are not yet
legally required

806
00:59:01,272 --> 00:59:04,907
to scan eyes, but we
adopted the technology

807
00:59:04,909 --> 00:59:08,277
and use it with the
parents' consent.

808
00:59:08,279 --> 00:59:10,712
I-I'm fine with it.
Do you, uh...?

809
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:13,949
- Scan, yeah. Do the scan.
- I dim the lights.

810
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:18,220
The system is non-obtrusive,

811
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:20,055
and in all actuality

812
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:23,992
is just taking
photo of the eyes.

813
00:59:23,994 --> 00:59:25,961
There you go.
Come here, Tobias.

814
00:59:25,963 --> 00:59:27,729
Oh, thank you.
You got it?

815
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:30,766
Y... Yes, I got it.
Thank you.

816
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:34,937
What happens then is,
the computer finds

817
00:59:34,939 --> 00:59:37,606
a bunch of points in the
crevices of the eye...

818
00:59:37,608 --> 00:59:39,568
Yeah, we-we understand
how it works.

819
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:50,752
Oh, forgive me.

820
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:54,122
These systems are sort of new.
Can you tell?

821
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:57,025
Paul Edgar Dairy?

822
00:59:57,027 --> 00:59:59,661
Sounds like a pirate.

823
00:59:59,663 --> 01:00:02,764
If this happens,
I'm supposed to punch in a key

824
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:04,866
and reboot.

825
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:10,872
Wait.

826
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:20,916
There we go.

827
01:00:20,918 --> 01:00:22,918
So I'll just
put in his info.

828
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:26,054
What is his name?

829
01:00:26,056 --> 01:00:28,790
I like Paul Edgar Dairy.
It's fine.

830
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:31,093
Tobias... George Gray.

831
01:00:31,095 --> 01:00:33,161
After his grandfather.

832
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:42,671
- Hello?
- Hi. Is this Ian Gray?

833
01:00:42,673 --> 01:00:45,073
It is.
My name is Dr. Simmons.

834
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:48,076
I work in conjunction with Yale
and the Greenwich hospital

835
01:00:48,078 --> 01:00:51,013
where you and your wife
gave birth in July.

836
01:00:51,015 --> 01:00:53,849
Y-Yeah, yeah.
Is every... everything okay?

837
01:00:53,851 --> 01:00:56,752
Yes, everything's okay.
Please don't be alarmed.

838
01:00:56,754 --> 01:00:58,754
We would, however,
like to run

839
01:00:58,756 --> 01:01:01,390
a few simple tests
on Tobias.

840
01:01:01,392 --> 01:01:05,293
His test results may suggest,
although highly unlikely,

841
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:08,230
the... the possibility
of early autism.

842
01:01:08,232 --> 01:01:11,233
You know I'm a doctor.
What test results?

843
01:01:11,235 --> 01:01:13,735
The... We've pinpointed...
Uh...

844
01:01:13,737 --> 01:01:16,304
Can you hold on
a moment, please?

845
01:01:16,306 --> 01:01:19,274
Karen, listen to this.

846
01:01:19,276 --> 01:01:21,109
Yeah.

847
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:23,311
We've pinpointed
an array of molecular compounds

848
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:25,013
that appear in the urine

849
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:27,149
of children with autism...

850
01:01:27,151 --> 01:01:29,184
and Tobias showcased

851
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,753
a few of them.
I promise it's unlikely,

852
01:01:31,755 --> 01:01:35,757
but worth checking out,
and we have very simple,

853
01:01:35,759 --> 01:01:38,794
non-obtrusive tests,
and we'll be done in an hour.

854
01:01:38,796 --> 01:01:40,996
What was your name
and affiliation?

855
01:01:40,998 --> 01:01:42,464
Dr. Janet Simmons.

856
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:45,000
I run a research lab
on child autism

857
01:01:45,002 --> 01:01:47,803
in conjunction with Yale
and the Greenwich hospital.

858
01:01:47,805 --> 01:01:50,272
Simmons, you said?
Janet Simmons.

859
01:01:50,274 --> 01:01:53,375
Our clinic is in Stamford,
not too far from there.

860
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:56,445
It's important
to check this soon.

861
01:01:56,447 --> 01:01:57,979
There's...

862
01:01:57,981 --> 01:02:01,283
no alarming rush, but...
we could see him today.

863
01:02:01,285 --> 01:02:03,285
Okay. Thank you.
You'll hear from us.

864
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:16,898
Tobias.

865
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:19,401
Look here. Look here.

866
01:02:36,019 --> 01:02:38,019
I'm not sure I understand

867
01:02:38,021 --> 01:02:39,788
how this is testing for autism.

868
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:42,891
The blood and urine tests will
check for molecular compounds.

869
01:02:42,893 --> 01:02:45,026
This test is
purely perceptual,

870
01:02:45,028 --> 01:02:47,195
tracking the child's
eye movements

871
01:02:47,197 --> 01:02:50,031
and attractions.

872
01:04:20,457 --> 01:04:23,425
Okay, that's enough. I'm...
Yeah. The test is over.

873
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:35,604
If you are calling regarding

874
01:04:35,606 --> 01:04:37,172
an existing child,

875
01:04:37,174 --> 01:04:39,608
please enter your seven-digit
session number.

876
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:44,379
This Dr. Simmons
is up to something.

877
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:46,581
Child autism, my ass.

878
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:48,350
I keep running through
her studies.

879
01:04:48,352 --> 01:04:51,386
What was she doing?
Two images side by side.

880
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:53,622
Two images,
similar but different.

881
01:04:53,624 --> 01:04:55,323
Tobias would look
at one or the other.

882
01:04:55,325 --> 01:04:57,592
Do you remember anything
specific about the images?

883
01:04:57,594 --> 01:05:00,028
Something connected
to something?

884
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:02,297
Something we could look up?

885
01:05:02,299 --> 01:05:05,133
There was a...
farmhouse.

886
01:05:08,372 --> 01:05:09,938
There was, um...

887
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:12,140
Dan's Diner in Boise, Idaho.

888
01:05:12,142 --> 01:05:13,642
Whatever that means.

889
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:17,579
Well, that's a real place.

890
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:43,305
Hello.

891
01:05:43,307 --> 01:05:44,940
What can I get you?

892
01:05:44,942 --> 01:05:47,409
Um, just a cup of coffee.

893
01:05:47,411 --> 01:05:49,377
Sure thing.

894
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:57,385
I'm not from around here.

895
01:05:57,387 --> 01:05:59,554
I was wondering, uh,
is there anything interesting

896
01:05:59,556 --> 01:06:01,256
in town to see?

897
01:06:01,258 --> 01:06:02,557
Not much around
these parts.

898
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:04,492
Unless you, uh,
fancy visiting some cows

899
01:06:04,494 --> 01:06:06,094
down at the dairy farm.

900
01:06:06,096 --> 01:06:08,296
There's a dairy farm?

901
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:09,698
Mm-hmm.
That'll be a dollar.

902
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,066
Oh.

903
01:06:11,068 --> 01:06:13,335
Of course.

904
01:06:13,337 --> 01:06:15,170
Where is the dairy
farm located?

905
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:17,238
Uh, take a left,
about two miles down the road.

906
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,707
Can't miss it.

907
01:06:32,022 --> 01:06:33,254
We'll have 'em through
in a moment.

908
01:06:33,256 --> 01:06:34,689
O-Okay.

909
01:06:34,691 --> 01:06:35,691
Come on!

910
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:42,063
Is this the dairy farm?

911
01:06:42,065 --> 01:06:43,999
Indeed it is.

912
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:47,302
These are milking cows?

913
01:06:47,304 --> 01:06:48,770
These are meat cows,
not milking cows.

914
01:06:48,772 --> 01:06:50,338
I'm Julie Dairy.

915
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,539
This is my family's farm.

916
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:54,242
Julie Dairy?

917
01:06:54,244 --> 01:06:56,244
Uh, Paul Edgar Dairy.

918
01:06:56,246 --> 01:06:57,545
Are you related to him?

919
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:00,682
Yes, he's my father.

920
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,553
Is he here?

921
01:07:05,555 --> 01:07:08,423
You're clearly not
with the biography association.

922
01:07:08,425 --> 01:07:09,524
The, um, I'm sorry.

923
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,192
I don't follow.

924
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:13,762
Some documentary crew came
through here a few months ago,

925
01:07:13,764 --> 01:07:16,231
wanting to do a story
on the great Paul Edgar Dairy,

926
01:07:16,233 --> 01:07:18,533
the only black farmer in Boise.

927
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,502
They took some pictures.

928
01:07:20,504 --> 01:07:23,338
I liked the story, and
they said they'd follow up.

929
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:27,042
You okay?

930
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:32,347
How you doing there?

931
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,184
I'm okay.

932
01:07:36,186 --> 01:07:38,086
I'm just, uh, having a moment

933
01:07:38,088 --> 01:07:39,621
of déjà vu.

934
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:41,456
Can we fetch you some water?

935
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:43,391
Or a cup of tea?

936
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:46,828
I'd really love to meet Paul,
if that was possible.

937
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:52,634
What if we just start at
the beginning and break it down?

938
01:07:52,636 --> 01:07:55,437
In the hospital,
Tobias's eyes come up as a match

939
01:07:55,439 --> 01:07:57,372
with Paul Edgar Dairy,
which is not correct,

940
01:07:57,374 --> 01:07:59,307
because Tobias has blue eyes

941
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:00,775
and Paul Edgar Dairy
has brown eyes.

942
01:08:00,777 --> 01:08:04,145
Uh, no, iris biometrics
is not based on color.

943
01:08:04,147 --> 01:08:05,780
It's based on
the unique crypts,

944
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:07,749
furrows and shapes
in the texture.

945
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:11,252
So maybe Tobias and Paul
have the same iris pattern.

946
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:12,720
Statistically impossible.

947
01:08:12,722 --> 01:08:15,090
Second data point.

948
01:08:15,092 --> 01:08:17,425
Tobias and Paul have
some kind of connection.

949
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:19,627
It's not our test,
so we don't know.

950
01:08:19,629 --> 01:08:21,729
And the third data point
is that

951
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:25,600
Paul Edgar Dairy dies
before Tobias is born.

952
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:27,569
Was conceived.

953
01:08:27,571 --> 01:08:31,206
Was conceived,
because Tobias is born

954
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:33,374
in July,
and Paul Edgar Dairy dies

955
01:08:33,376 --> 01:08:35,477
in September 2012; that's...

956
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:36,544
...that's ten months.
Okay, what-what are you guys

957
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:37,879
talking about right now?

958
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:39,481
This... you guys sound
like crazy people.

959
01:08:39,483 --> 01:08:41,649
Okay? What is this
connection referencing?

960
01:08:41,651 --> 01:08:44,252
Doctor...
Ja... Dr. Simmons.

961
01:08:44,254 --> 01:08:45,420
From Yale.

962
01:08:45,422 --> 01:08:47,155
She did this test on Tobias.

963
01:08:47,157 --> 01:08:48,490
Dr. Simmons?

964
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:49,891
From Yale?

965
01:08:49,893 --> 01:08:52,460
She's one-one of five people
who have access

966
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:54,362
to the eye database.
What?

967
01:08:54,364 --> 01:08:57,599
My company owns a patent
on iris biometrics

968
01:08:57,601 --> 01:09:00,435
and consolidate all their
data into one database.

969
01:09:00,437 --> 01:09:03,171
And Simmons is one of five
people that have access.

970
01:09:03,173 --> 01:09:05,173
But you have access
to it, too.

971
01:09:05,175 --> 01:09:06,641
Sort of.

972
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:08,610
I can find the
iris code, okay?

973
01:09:08,612 --> 01:09:10,678
Run it and see
if it's in the system,

974
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,580
and then check the IP address

975
01:09:12,582 --> 01:09:14,349
and check-check when
and where it was registered.

976
01:09:14,351 --> 01:09:15,517
I can do that.

977
01:09:15,519 --> 01:09:17,152
How do you do that?

978
01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:18,419
Look into that.

979
01:09:18,421 --> 01:09:19,888
Okay, other eye.

980
01:09:21,258 --> 01:09:23,158
All right.
Okay.

981
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:27,762
So I can't get your name
or biographicals,

982
01:09:27,764 --> 01:09:29,864
but I can see that
you are in the system.

983
01:09:29,866 --> 01:09:32,300
Amazing.
Right?

984
01:09:32,302 --> 01:09:34,903
And that...

985
01:09:34,905 --> 01:09:36,304
you were registered

986
01:09:36,306 --> 01:09:37,705
at the lab in 2005,

987
01:09:37,707 --> 01:09:40,267
and the same should be
for Karen and myself.

988
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:44,512
What are you thinking, Karen?

989
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:45,847
Well, check this out.

990
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:48,483
So Paul and Tobias

991
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:50,618
have the same iris patterns,
let's just say,

992
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:52,253
and there's some sort
of connection.

993
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:54,822
So the next logical step
in our scientific inquiry

994
01:09:54,824 --> 01:09:58,293
is to find someone

995
01:09:58,295 --> 01:10:01,229
that we do know
who's a duplicate in the system.

996
01:10:01,231 --> 01:10:02,897
Like a family member
who has died.

997
01:10:02,899 --> 01:10:04,632
That's it.
We need another match.

998
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:07,268
Guys, this is
statistically impossible.

999
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:08,336
You're not gonna find anything.

1000
01:10:08,338 --> 01:10:09,504
Can you get a scan

1001
01:10:09,506 --> 01:10:10,772
from a photo?

1002
01:10:10,774 --> 01:10:12,640
It has to be high-res
and in focus.

1003
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:13,942
Technically,
I can do it, but...

1004
01:10:13,944 --> 01:10:17,345
I have hundreds
of high-res photos

1005
01:10:17,347 --> 01:10:18,746
of people's eyes.
All right.

1006
01:10:18,748 --> 01:10:19,914
You can scan these.

1007
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:22,483
Give me the hard drive.

1008
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:24,919
This is ridiculous.

1009
01:10:24,921 --> 01:10:26,487
Who do you want me to run?

1010
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:28,489
Hmm, run my father.

1011
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:29,924
Tobias George Gray.

1012
01:10:29,926 --> 01:10:31,893
All right.
He died two years ago.

1013
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:37,465
He's in the system, and...

1014
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:39,467
and he's registered

1015
01:10:39,469 --> 01:10:41,469
- at Heathrow 2006.
- Okay.

1016
01:10:41,471 --> 01:10:42,770
That makes sense.

1017
01:10:42,772 --> 01:10:45,306
He-he was traveling there
frequently.

1018
01:10:45,308 --> 01:10:47,609
Try, um, my Uncle Basil.

1019
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:51,437
He died seven years
ago of cancer.

1020
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:54,015
All right.

1021
01:10:54,017 --> 01:10:55,450
Not found.

1022
01:10:55,452 --> 01:10:56,851
Try your grandparents.
My grandparents.

1023
01:10:56,853 --> 01:10:58,353
Yeah.
Bev and Barry.

1024
01:10:58,355 --> 01:11:00,321
Bev...

1025
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:03,658
She's in the system.

1026
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,860
Registered...

1027
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:08,696
at Schiphol Airport,
Amsterdam, in 1998.

1028
01:11:08,698 --> 01:11:10,598
How many people are
in the database?

1029
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,500
There's, like,
hundreds of millions.

1030
01:11:12,502 --> 01:11:14,269
There's a billion soon.

1031
01:11:14,271 --> 01:11:15,470
Try my grandparents.

1032
01:11:15,472 --> 01:11:17,338
Okay.
Right there.

1033
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:18,840
Judy is in the system.

1034
01:11:18,842 --> 01:11:22,043
She was registered
in a nursing home in New Haven

1035
01:11:22,045 --> 01:11:23,845
in 2009.
And Malcolm?

1036
01:11:23,847 --> 01:11:25,713
Malcolm...

1037
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:26,814
Not found.
Not registered.

1038
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,285
All right, so anybody else?

1039
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:34,555
Sofi.

1040
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:40,361
Okay, try-try Sofi.

1041
01:11:40,363 --> 01:11:41,596
Okay.

1042
01:11:41,598 --> 01:11:43,865
Sofi.

1043
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:55,777
She's in the system.

1044
01:11:55,779 --> 01:11:57,011
Yeah, that makes sense.

1045
01:11:57,013 --> 01:11:58,913
She was probably scanned

1046
01:11:58,915 --> 01:12:00,515
when she came through Customs.

1047
01:12:00,517 --> 01:12:03,084
No. It says that...

1048
01:12:03,086 --> 01:12:05,920
the IP address coordinates
say that she was scanned

1049
01:12:05,922 --> 01:12:08,056
in a community center
in Delhi, India.

1050
01:12:08,058 --> 01:12:10,792
She must have traveled there.

1051
01:12:10,794 --> 01:12:12,593
Three months ago?

1052
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:16,964
That doesn't make any sense.

1053
01:12:16,966 --> 01:12:18,066
That's not right.

1054
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:24,339
It's an error.

1055
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:28,042
It's only the seventh one
we tried.

1056
01:12:28,044 --> 01:12:30,611
I need to get some air.

1057
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:33,748
What the fuck
is happening?

1058
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:22,697
Did you put him to bed?

1059
01:13:22,699 --> 01:13:24,665
Yeah.

1060
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,108
You should go to India.

1061
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:41,182
I can't go to India.

1062
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,954
Can't or won't?

1063
01:13:46,956 --> 01:13:50,091
India is not
Boise, Idaho, Karen.

1064
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:52,827
There is someone there
with Sofi's exact iris pattern.

1065
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:57,565
The eyes and the brain
are connected.

1066
01:13:57,567 --> 01:14:00,001
If-if the cellular structure
in the eye

1067
01:14:00,003 --> 01:14:01,936
is reoccurring
from person to person,

1068
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:04,005
then maybe something
in the brain

1069
01:14:04,007 --> 01:14:05,540
carries over as well,

1070
01:14:05,542 --> 01:14:08,142
like a neurological link...

1071
01:14:08,144 --> 01:14:11,746
Maybe the eye really is
some kind of...

1072
01:14:11,748 --> 01:14:14,515
window to the soul.

1073
01:14:14,517 --> 01:14:16,184
Soul, Karen? Soul?

1074
01:14:16,186 --> 01:14:19,620
Is my wife really using
the word "soul"?

1075
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:22,023
Like you hold
any validity in that?

1076
01:14:22,025 --> 01:14:23,758
Call it whatever you want
to call it.

1077
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,626
Dr. Simmons was testing
a memory connection

1078
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:29,163
between our son
and Paul Edgar Dairy.

1079
01:14:29,165 --> 01:14:32,133
And it wasn't our test,
but you can go to India,

1080
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:34,502
and you can find this person
with Sofi's eyes,

1081
01:14:34,504 --> 01:14:35,703
and you can do the same.

1082
01:14:35,705 --> 01:14:37,038
I can't go there.

1083
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,739
It's just India.
Why can't you make...

1084
01:14:38,741 --> 01:14:40,141
Not India. I can't go there!

1085
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:41,609
I can't go back there!

1086
01:14:41,611 --> 01:14:43,478
I can't go back
to that part of my life!

1087
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:44,712
I can't do it!

1088
01:14:57,826 --> 01:15:00,761
I gotta just let it go.

1089
01:15:16,778 --> 01:15:19,080
The man I married...

1090
01:15:19,082 --> 01:15:21,749
I don't think he would let
his own grief,

1091
01:15:21,751 --> 01:15:24,085
even if it was overwhelming,

1092
01:15:24,087 --> 01:15:26,187
get in the way
of what could potentially be

1093
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:28,222
the greatest
scientific discovery

1094
01:15:28,224 --> 01:15:30,057
the world has ever seen.

1095
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:34,962
This is bigger than you.

1096
01:15:34,964 --> 01:15:36,931
It's bigger than me.

1097
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:39,934
It's bigger than Sofi.

1098
01:15:39,936 --> 01:15:42,169
Then-then maybe you should go.

1099
01:15:42,171 --> 01:15:44,272
I would...

1100
01:15:44,274 --> 01:15:48,175
but I-I didn't know Sofi.

1101
01:15:48,177 --> 01:15:49,977
It's a false positive,
you understand?

1102
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:51,846
It's an error;
it has to be an error.

1103
01:15:51,848 --> 01:15:54,749
It's st... it's a statistically
impossible data point.

1104
01:15:57,619 --> 01:16:00,254
If I drop this phone
a thousand times,

1105
01:16:00,256 --> 01:16:02,123
a million times,

1106
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:04,559
and one time it doesn't fall,

1107
01:16:04,561 --> 01:16:06,861
just once,

1108
01:16:06,863 --> 01:16:08,963
it hovers...

1109
01:16:08,965 --> 01:16:10,798
in the air...

1110
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:15,303
...that is an error
that's worth looking at.

1111
01:16:15,305 --> 01:16:18,272
You're so fucking stubborn.

1112
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:42,229
Technology has barely touched

1113
01:16:42,231 --> 01:16:44,031
Mira Devi's daily life.

1114
01:16:44,033 --> 01:16:45,299
In her hut, muscle,

1115
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:47,868
not machines,
gets the chores done.

1116
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:49,870
That is about to change for Mira

1117
01:16:49,872 --> 01:16:52,139
and perhaps millions like her.

1118
01:16:52,141 --> 01:16:53,207
At this center,

1119
01:16:53,209 --> 01:16:55,242
<i>her irises are scanned</i>

1120
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:56,377
<i>with biometric devices.</i>

1121
01:16:56,379 --> 01:16:58,713
<i>They're uploaded and then sent</i>

1122
01:16:58,715 --> 01:17:00,381
<i>to a massive server.</i>

1123
01:17:00,383 --> 01:17:02,817
<i>Once this information
is processed,</i>

1124
01:17:02,819 --> 01:17:06,687
<i>out comes a 12-digit number
for her and her only.</i>

1125
01:17:06,689 --> 01:17:08,723
<i>India's unique
identification program</i>

1126
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:10,725
<i>started just a year ago.</i>

1127
01:17:10,727 --> 01:17:12,326
<i>If it succeeds,</i>

1128
01:17:12,328 --> 01:17:15,830
<i>India will become the
first country in the world</i>

1129
01:17:15,832 --> 01:17:17,798
<i>using biometric data
for identity purposes</i>

1130
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,767
<i>on a national scale.</i>

1131
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:41,422
Whoa.

1132
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:50,831
First time to India?

1133
01:17:52,435 --> 01:17:54,035
It is, actually.

1134
01:17:54,037 --> 01:17:55,703
Yeah.

1135
01:17:55,705 --> 01:17:57,171
Darryl Mackenzie.

1136
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:59,073
Uh, Dr. Ian Gray.

1137
01:17:59,075 --> 01:18:00,808
Oh, "Doctor."

1138
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:03,110
Well.

1139
01:18:03,112 --> 01:18:06,047
Two men, both doing good work.

1140
01:18:06,049 --> 01:18:08,115
What do you do?

1141
01:18:08,117 --> 01:18:10,818
Well, I'm in sales,
but, uh...

1142
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:14,722
...also do The Man's work.

1143
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:19,260
The Lord's work.

1144
01:18:19,262 --> 01:18:20,695
Oh.

1145
01:18:20,697 --> 01:18:22,730
Uh, of course.

1146
01:18:25,435 --> 01:18:27,702
Good night, Dr. Gray.

1147
01:18:27,704 --> 01:18:28,984
Uh, have a good night.

1148
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:32,106
Hope our paths
cross again.

1149
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:15,950
Hello.

1150
01:19:15,952 --> 01:19:18,219
Uh, can I help you?

1151
01:19:18,221 --> 01:19:20,087
You seem like the boss
of this place.

1152
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:22,156
Boss? No, circus manager,
more like it.

1153
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:23,457
I'm Priya Varma.

1154
01:19:23,459 --> 01:19:24,859
How can I help you?

1155
01:19:24,861 --> 01:19:26,026
I'm Dr. Ian Gray.

1156
01:19:26,028 --> 01:19:27,795
I'm visiting from America.

1157
01:19:27,797 --> 01:19:31,232
I have a very strange request.

1158
01:19:31,234 --> 01:19:32,967
Yes?

1159
01:19:32,969 --> 01:19:35,069
I'm looking for someone

1160
01:19:35,071 --> 01:19:37,037
who was scanned here
a while back.

1161
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:39,473
The thing is,
I-I don't have their name.

1162
01:19:39,475 --> 01:19:42,243
All I have is a picture
of their eyes.

1163
01:19:46,414 --> 01:19:48,516
This is what their
eyes look like.

1164
01:19:48,518 --> 01:19:50,851
They may not be
this exact color.

1165
01:19:50,853 --> 01:19:52,453
Uh...

1166
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:55,489
Why are you looking for her?

1167
01:19:55,491 --> 01:19:57,057
Is she in some kind of trouble?

1168
01:19:57,059 --> 01:19:58,859
Her?

1169
01:19:58,861 --> 01:20:00,494
Uh, no, of course not.

1170
01:20:00,496 --> 01:20:01,929
She's not in trouble.

1171
01:20:01,931 --> 01:20:03,998
She's-she's incredibly special.

1172
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,267
So you do recognize them?

1173
01:20:06,269 --> 01:20:08,569
I do, if it is
who I think it is,

1174
01:20:08,571 --> 01:20:10,504
but why are you looking for her?

1175
01:20:10,506 --> 01:20:12,473
Here's another photo.

1176
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:16,443
Okay, um,
this doesn't make sense.

1177
01:20:16,445 --> 01:20:17,845
These are her eyes,

1178
01:20:17,847 --> 01:20:20,147
but this isn't her face
around them.

1179
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:23,890
That's exactly why
I'm looking for her.

1180
01:20:27,055 --> 01:20:28,255
Salomina.

1181
01:20:28,257 --> 01:20:29,423
Salomina?
Yeah.

1182
01:20:29,425 --> 01:20:32,860
Sweet girl, uh,
very smart girl.

1183
01:20:32,862 --> 01:20:35,996
But, uh,
I haven't seen her recently.

1184
01:20:35,998 --> 01:20:38,532
When was the last time
you saw her?

1185
01:20:38,534 --> 01:20:41,101
Uh, a few months ago.

1186
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:45,206
Could you help me find her?

1187
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:46,907
Um...

1188
01:20:46,909 --> 01:20:49,543
I could make a donation
to the community center.

1189
01:20:49,545 --> 01:20:52,112
I mean, I'm-I'm going
to make a donation

1190
01:20:52,114 --> 01:20:53,948
to the community center.

1191
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:56,517
I don't want to sound crass,
like I'm bribing you,

1192
01:20:56,519 --> 01:20:58,385
but I am kind of bribing you.

1193
01:20:58,387 --> 01:21:00,087
No, no, no, of course.

1194
01:21:00,089 --> 01:21:02,890
I mean, of course, any donation
would help the center.

1195
01:21:02,892 --> 01:21:05,092
Uh...

1196
01:21:05,094 --> 01:21:06,927
It's very important.

1197
01:21:06,929 --> 01:21:08,896
Please.

1198
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:11,532
Okay.

1199
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:14,635
You meet me tomorrow at 12:00

1200
01:21:14,637 --> 01:21:17,938
at the Okhla market, okay?

1201
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:46,567
All right, I-I'll take a...

1202
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:48,535
You want me to take
a photo of you?

1203
01:21:50,473 --> 01:21:52,306
You want to see?

1204
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:56,944
You see? Okay.

1205
01:21:56,946 --> 01:21:58,045
Hello.

1206
01:22:03,618 --> 01:22:05,519
I almost didn't come.

1207
01:22:05,521 --> 01:22:07,354
Yeah, I was worried.

1208
01:22:07,356 --> 01:22:09,423
What changed your mind?

1209
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:10,958
I, um...

1210
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,593
I did some research on you.

1211
01:22:12,595 --> 01:22:14,662
Uh-oh.

1212
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:17,331
Come.

1213
01:22:22,939 --> 01:22:25,439
Hello.

1214
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:27,107
Do all these children...

1215
01:22:27,109 --> 01:22:29,643
do they eventually end up
at the community center or...

1216
01:22:29,645 --> 01:22:31,979
Some do,

1217
01:22:31,981 --> 01:22:34,081
but there are over
one million people

1218
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:37,084
living in this
30-block radius alone.

1219
01:22:37,086 --> 01:22:38,986
According to the registrar,

1220
01:22:38,988 --> 01:22:41,288
Salomina and her parents
live here.

1221
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:43,958
Somebody's here... I'm gonna
ask this lady here.

1222
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,726
Okay.

1223
01:22:50,366 --> 01:22:51,846
...Salomina.
Ah, Salomina...

1224
01:23:10,518 --> 01:23:12,152
What's wrong?

1225
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:13,554
What'd she say?

1226
01:23:19,094 --> 01:23:22,396
<i>She could be living
like a stray dog.</i>

1227
01:23:22,398 --> 01:23:24,064
She's totally alone.

1228
01:23:24,066 --> 01:23:26,433
Her mother's dead;
her father's dead.

1229
01:23:26,435 --> 01:23:29,570
She knows the address
of the community center,

1230
01:23:29,572 --> 01:23:32,740
but Priya said she hasn't
been there in weeks.

1231
01:23:32,742 --> 01:23:35,642
There's a million people living
in a ten-block radius.

1232
01:23:35,644 --> 01:23:38,312
It's gonna be impossible
to find her.

1233
01:23:41,316 --> 01:23:43,550
Well, you shouldn't give up.

1234
01:23:43,552 --> 01:23:45,185
You flew halfway
around the world.

1235
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:46,453
You should keep looking.

1236
01:23:46,455 --> 01:23:49,723
At least give it a few days.

1237
01:23:49,725 --> 01:23:51,759
I'm gonna go to bed.

1238
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:54,728
Good night.

1239
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:56,497
Bye.

1240
01:24:03,739 --> 01:24:05,706
What am I doing here?

1241
01:24:33,768 --> 01:24:36,470
You're mad.

1242
01:24:36,472 --> 01:24:38,705
It's a smoke signal.

1243
01:24:38,707 --> 01:24:41,708
Someone she knows will see it.

1244
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:45,079
I'm glad you didn't
put my number up there.

1245
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:53,520
Hello?

1246
01:24:53,522 --> 01:24:54,655
Hello?

1247
01:24:54,657 --> 01:24:56,723
Hi, yes?

1248
01:24:56,725 --> 01:24:59,159
Yeah, my niece has eyes like
the picture board, cash reward.

1249
01:24:59,161 --> 01:25:01,128
Are they just like the ones
in the picture?

1250
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:03,130
Yes, I think so.

1251
01:25:03,132 --> 01:25:04,298
Like, exactly?

1252
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:05,399
Uh, very much so.

1253
01:25:05,401 --> 01:25:06,633
How old is your niece?

1254
01:25:06,635 --> 01:25:07,801
Eighteen.

1255
01:25:07,803 --> 01:25:09,770
My other niece is 15.

1256
01:25:09,772 --> 01:25:12,873
Oh, no, um, sorry.

1257
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:14,274
Thank you, no.

1258
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:15,642
Sorry, wrong person.

1259
01:25:15,644 --> 01:25:17,111
Bye.

1260
01:25:24,153 --> 01:25:25,619
<i>Hello?</i>

1261
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:30,491
Do you speak English?

1262
01:25:30,493 --> 01:25:31,792
Yes, I do.

1263
01:25:31,794 --> 01:25:34,495
I'm sorry,
what-what were you saying?

1264
01:25:34,497 --> 01:25:37,431
I have the eyes you took up
the advertisement for.

1265
01:25:37,433 --> 01:25:38,732
How old are you?

1266
01:25:38,734 --> 01:25:40,234
Twenty-four.

1267
01:25:40,236 --> 01:25:41,835
No, sorry.

1268
01:25:41,837 --> 01:25:43,871
The person I'm looking for
is much younger.

1269
01:25:43,873 --> 01:25:45,372
No, thank you for calling.

1270
01:25:45,374 --> 01:25:46,507
Sorry.

1271
01:26:00,222 --> 01:26:01,722
Very good!

1272
01:26:01,724 --> 01:26:03,590
I'm the best!
I'm the very best?

1273
01:26:03,592 --> 01:26:05,225
I'm the very best.

1274
01:26:05,227 --> 01:26:06,727
Very good.

1275
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:20,440
Dr. Gray, are you...
are you religious?

1276
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:24,878
Am I religious?

1277
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,947
I thought you researched me.

1278
01:26:26,949 --> 01:26:28,649
I'm not religious.

1279
01:26:28,651 --> 01:26:30,584
Why not?

1280
01:26:32,587 --> 01:26:35,756
Religion is based
on scripture written by men

1281
01:26:35,758 --> 01:26:37,457
thousands of years ago.

1282
01:26:37,459 --> 01:26:40,727
Those beliefs can't be
changed or challenged.

1283
01:26:40,729 --> 01:26:41,929
They're fixed.

1284
01:26:41,931 --> 01:26:43,363
In science,

1285
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:45,732
great thinkers
have written things

1286
01:26:45,734 --> 01:26:47,401
very long ago,

1287
01:26:47,403 --> 01:26:50,771
but every generation
improves upon them.

1288
01:26:50,773 --> 01:26:52,806
The words are not holy.

1289
01:26:52,808 --> 01:26:55,742
Einstein is a brilliant man,
but he's not our god.

1290
01:26:57,478 --> 01:27:01,281
He's one step in the evolution
of knowledge,

1291
01:27:01,283 --> 01:27:03,584
but we always continue
to step forward.

1292
01:27:03,586 --> 01:27:04,818
You know...

1293
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:07,487
a scientist once asked
the Dalai Lama,

1294
01:27:07,489 --> 01:27:10,524
"What would you do
if something scientific

1295
01:27:10,526 --> 01:27:13,427
disproved your
religious beliefs?"

1296
01:27:13,429 --> 01:27:15,629
And he said,
after much thought,

1297
01:27:15,631 --> 01:27:17,698
"I would look
at all the papers.

1298
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:19,533
"I'd take a look
at all the research

1299
01:27:19,535 --> 01:27:22,803
"and really try to
understand things.

1300
01:27:22,805 --> 01:27:24,638
"And in the end, if it was clear

1301
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:28,675
"that the scientific evidence
disproved my spiritual beliefs,

1302
01:27:28,677 --> 01:27:32,446
I would change my beliefs."

1303
01:27:32,448 --> 01:27:34,414
That's a good answer.

1304
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:39,786
Ian...

1305
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:44,625
...what would you do
if something spiritual

1306
01:27:44,627 --> 01:27:47,928
disproved
your scientific beliefs?

1307
01:28:16,357 --> 01:28:18,025
Hello, love.

1308
01:28:18,027 --> 01:28:20,327
The bank called today.

1309
01:28:20,329 --> 01:28:22,296
They said that $2,000 a day

1310
01:28:22,298 --> 01:28:23,997
is going to some sketchy
Planet India company.

1311
01:28:23,999 --> 01:28:25,465
It's, like, 20k already.

1312
01:28:25,467 --> 01:28:27,534
What's going on?

1313
01:28:27,536 --> 01:28:28,969
I put up a billboard.

1314
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:30,704
I-I know it sounds
a bit extreme,

1315
01:28:30,706 --> 01:28:32,039
but it's all I could think of.

1316
01:28:32,041 --> 01:28:34,941
Ian, it's been weeks.

1317
01:28:34,943 --> 01:28:37,477
I think you should come back.

1318
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,682
Karen, what-what happened

1319
01:28:41,684 --> 01:28:44,484
to turning over rocks
and finding nothing is progress?

1320
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:46,620
I'm down with
the big picture of all this.

1321
01:28:46,622 --> 01:28:48,955
I'm the one
who wanted you to go.

1322
01:28:48,957 --> 01:28:51,892
But failed experiments
are not unknown to us, right?

1323
01:28:51,894 --> 01:28:53,360
We regroup.

1324
01:28:53,362 --> 01:28:54,828
We look for more matches.

1325
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:57,364
We try again.

1326
01:28:57,366 --> 01:28:59,499
Please come home.

1327
01:30:34,729 --> 01:30:36,596
Do you speak English?

1328
01:30:36,598 --> 01:30:38,465
A little.

1329
01:30:38,467 --> 01:30:39,666
A little?

1330
01:30:39,668 --> 01:30:42,469
Yes.

1331
01:30:42,471 --> 01:30:44,471
What's your name?

1332
01:30:44,473 --> 01:30:45,705
Salomina.

1333
01:30:45,707 --> 01:30:47,040
Salomina?

1334
01:30:47,042 --> 01:30:49,509
Yes.

1335
01:30:49,511 --> 01:30:51,044
Salomina,

1336
01:30:51,046 --> 01:30:52,946
I-I'm Ian.

1337
01:30:52,948 --> 01:30:55,449
My name is Ian.

1338
01:30:56,651 --> 01:30:58,118
Are you hungry?

1339
01:30:58,120 --> 01:30:59,519
Yes.

1340
01:30:59,521 --> 01:31:01,488
- You are?
- Yes.

1341
01:31:02,757 --> 01:31:05,091
Come on.

1342
01:31:05,093 --> 01:31:06,993
Let's get you some food.

1343
01:31:06,995 --> 01:31:08,962
Come on.

1344
01:31:10,965 --> 01:31:12,599
Priya, I found her.

1345
01:31:12,601 --> 01:31:14,501
Where are you?
I'm going to the hotel.

1346
01:31:14,503 --> 01:31:16,036
Um, hey!

1347
01:31:16,038 --> 01:31:17,537
Can you meet me there?

1348
01:31:17,539 --> 01:31:19,506
Listen, I'll be
right there, okay?

1349
01:31:38,693 --> 01:31:40,660
What's your favorite food?

1350
01:31:40,662 --> 01:31:43,096
Strawberry.

1351
01:31:43,098 --> 01:31:45,665
Strawberry?
Just strawberry?

1352
01:31:52,974 --> 01:31:54,875
What's your favorite color?

1353
01:31:54,877 --> 01:31:59,513
Pink, purple, blue and green.

1354
01:31:59,515 --> 01:32:01,715
Pink, purple... blue and green?
Blue and green.

1355
01:32:01,717 --> 01:32:02,916
That's so many.

1356
01:32:02,918 --> 01:32:05,185
See my finger?
Can you follow it?

1357
01:32:06,554 --> 01:32:08,188
Very good.

1358
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:11,024
Very good. Very good.

1359
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:12,158
Very good.

1360
01:32:47,895 --> 01:32:49,663
You okay?
You comfortable?

1361
01:32:49,665 --> 01:32:51,665
You okay?
Yes.

1362
01:32:58,574 --> 01:33:00,740
Are you there?
Yeah.

1363
01:33:06,714 --> 01:33:10,016
I want to show you something
that will take your breath away.

1364
01:33:22,063 --> 01:33:24,130
Karen, this is Salomina.

1365
01:33:24,132 --> 01:33:26,700
Salomina, this is Karen.

1366
01:33:31,105 --> 01:33:32,906
I need my lab partner.

1367
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:36,743
Okay. Yeah.

1368
01:33:36,745 --> 01:33:39,179
I'm ready.

1369
01:33:39,181 --> 01:33:44,618
Okay, so, Salomina,
it's a very easy game.

1370
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:46,987
I'm going to show you
three things, and you pick

1371
01:33:46,989 --> 01:33:48,288
the one that's
your favorite.

1372
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:49,823
Okay.
You understand?

1373
01:33:49,825 --> 01:33:51,091
Yes.
Okay.

1374
01:33:51,093 --> 01:33:53,627
Commencing experiment one.

1375
01:33:53,629 --> 01:33:55,895
Memory connection
between subjects

1376
01:33:55,897 --> 01:33:57,263
with identical iris patterns.

1377
01:33:57,265 --> 01:33:58,398
Got it.

1378
01:33:59,667 --> 01:34:02,035
Salomina.

1379
01:34:02,037 --> 01:34:04,371
"S" as in...
Shut the front door.

1380
01:34:05,707 --> 01:34:07,807
"A" as in...
Amazing.

1381
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:10,010
"L" as in...
Love you.

1382
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:14,280
"O"...
Open-minded.

1383
01:34:14,282 --> 01:34:15,649
"M" as in...

1384
01:34:15,651 --> 01:34:16,816
Maestro.

1385
01:34:16,818 --> 01:34:17,917
"I" as in...

1386
01:34:17,919 --> 01:34:19,719
Ian Gray.

1387
01:34:19,721 --> 01:34:21,321
"N" as in...

1388
01:34:21,323 --> 01:34:23,790
No way this is true.

1389
01:34:23,792 --> 01:34:25,959
"A" as in...

1390
01:34:27,261 --> 01:34:29,229
Afterlife.

1391
01:34:30,698 --> 01:34:33,166
Okay. Let's start.

1392
01:34:33,168 --> 01:34:34,701
You ready?
Yes.

1393
01:34:34,703 --> 01:34:35,983
Yes? Okay.

1394
01:34:38,839 --> 01:34:40,907
Here we go.

1395
01:34:47,982 --> 01:34:50,817

1396
01:35:04,165 --> 01:35:06,399

1397
01:35:17,011 --> 01:35:18,378

Delta,

1400
01:35:32,127 --> 01:35:34,961
incorrect, but it...
it's not a good one.

1401
01:35:40,367 --> 01:35:43,403
Echo, incorrect.

1402
01:35:43,405 --> 01:35:44,838
Sort of.

1403
01:35:45,873 --> 01:35:47,440
Okay.

1404
01:35:54,882 --> 01:35:57,250

India...

1408
01:36:15,337 --> 01:36:17,137
correct.

1409
01:36:17,139 --> 01:36:19,205
Joker, incorrect.

01:36:19,207 --> 01:36:20,807

01:36:20,809 --> 01:36:22,375
Love...

1412
01:36:22,377 --> 01:36:24,144
correct.

1413
01:36:26,347 --> 01:36:27,480
Incorrect.

...correct.

1421
01:37:33,914 --> 01:37:36,216
Okay.

1422
01:37:47,161 --> 01:37:49,295
What's the tally?

1423
01:37:50,364 --> 01:37:52,932
44 percent.

1424
01:37:52,934 --> 01:37:56,236
Which is, um,
a touch above random

1425
01:37:56,238 --> 01:38:00,640
by an unfortunately
standard margin.

1426
01:38:07,281 --> 01:38:09,949
How do you feel?

1427
01:38:14,054 --> 01:38:15,989
I think numbers don't lie.

1428
01:38:15,991 --> 01:38:19,425
I didn't ask what you think;
I asked what you feel.

1429
01:38:21,028 --> 01:38:24,297
I feel...

1430
01:38:24,299 --> 01:38:26,399
kind of foolish.

1431
01:38:32,373 --> 01:38:34,574
I'll see you soon.

1432
01:38:34,576 --> 01:38:36,276
Okay.

1433
01:38:43,083 --> 01:38:46,019
I make bad test?

1434
01:38:47,154 --> 01:38:48,588
What?

1435
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:51,257
I make bad test?

1436
01:38:51,259 --> 01:38:52,525
No.

1437
01:38:52,527 --> 01:38:54,160
No, you did fine.

1438
01:38:54,162 --> 01:38:55,662
You did perfect.

1439
01:38:55,664 --> 01:38:59,699
It's just a stupid test.

Give me an update
on the archivist images.

1442
01:46:42,063 --> 01:46:44,029
We've collected
hundreds of images

at high enough resolution.

Just, uh, waiting
on your approval to scan.
