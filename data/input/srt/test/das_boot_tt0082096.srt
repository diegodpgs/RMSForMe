1
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:14,610
Our bosun's mate.
Been on quite a bender tonight.

2
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,579
Who are those pigs?

3
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:43,222
Their fireboat drill.
They're all from my boat.

4
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,040
Captain.

5
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:21,051
Marten's crew.
They move out at dawn.

6
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:33,355
It's time to find ourselves
a little French quail.

7
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:39,111
Do you know how to flush it out?

8
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,616
They're scared. They comfort
themselves in women and schnapps.

9
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:49,788
- What's going on here?
- Ready ... Fire!

10
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:02,134
- Sir.
- My second officer.

11
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:09,350
This is Lieutenant Werner.
War correspondent.

12
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:16,815
He'll ship out with us, and report
the truth about life on a submarine.

13
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:22,863
- Welcome on board, Lieutenant.
- Good evening.

14
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:32,039
Come and have a drink with us.

15
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:38,754
- Good evening, Captain.
- Two beers, please.

16
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:59,108
Where's our friend Thomsen?
He should be celebrating his medal.

17
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,073
Have you talked to your wife?

18
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:13,789
No calls to Germany
before 10 o'clock.

19
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,171
- Two beers.
- Thanks.

20
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,509
Captain.

21
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:33,392
My report from U96, sir.
All provisions and arms aboard.

22
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,688
- Thank you.
- One more thing, Captain.

23
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:46,530
On the way here
some of the crew molested me.

24
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:52,327
It was ... quite outrageous.

25
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,790
- They stopped me and ...
- You were initiated?

26
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,629
- Exactly.
- Me, too.

27
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:12,973
May I have your attention?
Silence would be appreciated!

28
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:19,188
I'd like to call on Lt. Thomsen,
our latest hero!

29
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:37,664
Thomsen is from the old guard.
He's always drunk now.

30
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,981
Quiet in this whorehouse!

31
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:19,164
To our wonderful ... abstaining ...
womanless Fuhrer, -

32
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:25,838
- who rose gloriously
from an apprentice painter -

33
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:30,968
- to become the world's
greatest battle strategist.

34
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:34,805
Isn't it true?

35
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:43,856
He's a great naval expert.
Who, in his infinite wisdom ...

36
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:56,326
How does it go again?

37
00:08:56,494 --> 00:09:02,666
Our great Fuhrer has been showing
their English bed-wetter ...

38
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:07,463
... the cigar-chomping
asshole Churchill ...

39
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:14,636
... where exactly to go
and stick his stinking cigars.

40
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,096
Excuse me.

41
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:01,809
I'll see you in the morning.
I must phone home.

42
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:21,161
Phillip, the old bunch has gone.

43
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:29,044
Look at these new heroes.
All wind and smoke. Big mouths.

44
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:32,464
Yeah, yeah ...

45
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:37,469
Cheeks together.
Balls in hand.

46
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:42,766
And the belief in our Fuhrer
in their eyes.

47
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:46,145
They will know in time.

48
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:40,949
Combat! Conquer! Order!

49
00:11:55,298 --> 00:12:01,887
Come on, Phillip.
Give me a hand. Help me get him up.

50
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:14,608
I wanted to really ...
screw my brains out tonight, -

51
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:19,363
- but I'm not
in any condition to fuck.

52
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:38,757
That's Thomsen's boat.
Find anything wrong with our boat?

53
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:44,179
- The propeller plate was banged.
- I see.

54
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:51,353
- That explains the whining noise.
- We've got a brand new one.

55
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:27,639
That's our boat.

56
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:36,023
Stand by for inspection! Attention!
Eyes left!

57
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:48,118
All hands present and accounted for.
The boat is clear for sea, Captain.

58
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:51,663
Thank you, Number One.

59
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,672
At ease.

60
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:20,275
Well, men ...

61
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:25,072
- All set?
- All set, sir!

62
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:33,747
We have a guest on board.
Lt. Werner.

63
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:40,963
A war correspondent.
He has even brought his camera.

64
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:54,435
He is writing about war heroes.
See you remember your manners.

65
00:14:54,602 --> 00:15:00,899
- Aye-aye, sir!
- Harbour stations, men.

66
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:52,910
Sink them all!

67
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,649
Get those crates out of here!
This isn't a vegetable garden.

68
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:27,820
Fish store, where we maintain
and store the torpedoes.

69
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:32,324
- You're going to be in the papers!
- Thank you, men.

70
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:37,705
Follow me. Here we have the can.
Just one for 50 men.

71
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:43,836
The other one's full of provisions.
You can't eat shit. Logical, no?

72
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:51,885
Here's the Chief Petty Officer's
quarters. My home away from home.

73
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:57,141
- I've brought plenty of books.
- You have it really cosy here.

74
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:02,479
- Where are you, Lieutenant?
- I hope you don't get sea sick.

75
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:08,944
Here's the radio and the hydrophone.
The eyes and ears of the boat.

76
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:15,034
Here's the control room.
The boat's command post.

77
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:21,707
Through here, Lieutenant.

78
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:26,003
Wake up, you've got company.

79
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:29,631
Good morning, Lieutenant.

80
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:34,053
The petty officers' bunk
sleeps 12 men.

81
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,973
Two to a bunk.
One sleeps while one is on duty.

82
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:43,395
One man comes off watch and
climbs into the other man's stink.

83
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:49,068
You've got a bunk to yourself
since you're a guest on board.

84
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:53,697
- Here.
- This is your escape gear.

85
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:59,745
- You can use it in the shower.
- The mask helps out with the stink.

86
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:03,791
Of Frenssen's feet!

87
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,503
Come on.

88
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:15,177
This is our galley.
And here's Johann, our phantom.

89
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:22,559
Johann, everything in order?

90
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:28,982
- Permission to come up?
- Yes, Lieutenant.

91
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:53,507
It's better to take photos
on our return from the mission.

92
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:57,302
What do you mean?

93
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,432
They'll have grown beards by then.

94
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:16,155
The British will be ashamed
to see these shaven faces.

95
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:22,703
Pale-faced kids.
Innocents dragged from mama's skirt.

96
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:31,086
Sailing with them
makes you feel so old.

97
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:38,969
It's like a children's crusade.

98
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:50,939
- Permission to pass, sir.
- Carry on.

99
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:55,069
- Bon appetit.
- Thank you.

100
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:23,889
- From Mexico, aren't you?
- Yes. South of Mexico City.

101
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:30,896
- Good there?
- Very nice. Good climate.

102
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:49,957
- Quite a way.
- As a German, I had to come.

103
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:58,048
- Did you work there?
- On my step-parents' plantation.

104
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:04,430
- You're the boss's son?
- You could say so.

105
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:11,186
- Stand by, first watch.
- Excuse me.

106
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:16,984
Can I get by?

107
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,996
Permission to go on watch, Captain.

108
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:38,005
A new breed, our Mexican recruit.

109
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:46,096
A young machine.
He follows orders without question.

110
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:51,977
He's so uptight he could
crack nuts with his butt cheeks.

111
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:08,369
- Permission to come up?
- Yes, Lieutenant.

112
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,330
Stand by main vents.

113
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:22,341
- Shut out main engines!
- All hands forward!

114
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:29,431
All hands forward!
Come on, move it.

115
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:34,978
Come on, move! Move! Faster!

116
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:38,315
Get a move on, you guys!

117
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:45,447
It's an alarm, not a blasted cruise!
Get into diving positions!

118
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:06,218
Blow negative tank.

119
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:12,307
Stern planes ease to 10 degrees.

120
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:28,949
Not bad. Practice makes perfect.
It keeps you from getting rusty.

121
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:31,827
A practice drill.

122
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:39,251
- Level off, Chief.
- Bow up 1 5. Stern up 10.

123
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,755
Planes on zero.

124
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:49,178
- Levelled off, sir.
- Shut all main vents.

125
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:57,102
- Main vents shut.
- Dive. Let's see how she does.

126
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:01,774
Bow planes down 1 5. Stern up 10.

127
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:18,290
The boat is rated to 90 metres,
but of course we could go deeper.

128
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:34,181
There's a limit somewhere.
We can only take so much pressure -

129
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:39,770
- before the boat will be crushed.

130
00:24:53,410 --> 00:25:03,544
Check all valves.

131
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:07,506
- The pressure.
- Yeah, sure.

132
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,183
Deeper.

133
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:22,980
140 metres.

134
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:33,490
- She must take this depth.
- 1 50.

135
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,415
160 metres.

136
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:53,469
- That'll do for now. Surface.
- Bow up 10. Stern up 5.

137
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:56,930
Our journalist is sweating.

138
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:41,058
Your girl?

139
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:47,856
French girl?

140
00:26:54,197 --> 00:27:00,953
Do you know the flower shop
beside Cafe A L'Ami Pierrot?

141
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:05,165
- A L'Ami Pierrot.
- Sure, I know it.

142
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:09,545
The two pretty salesgirls.
Jeannette and ...

143
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:12,881
Francoise.

144
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:19,013
Nobody knows ... but we're engaged.

145
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:22,266
Unofficially.

146
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:31,442
Can I see?

147
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:38,115
Very pretty. Really.

148
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:46,832
What's wrong?

149
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:52,671
She's pregnant.

150
00:27:55,133 --> 00:28:00,220
Don't you know what that means?

151
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:04,641
If the resistance finds out?
A German baby.

152
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:11,815
I told her,
but she wants to have it.

153
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:19,907
- She wants a baby.
- You've got problems, friend.

154
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:14,837
Our masters spend all their time
finding Churchill new nicknames.

155
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:17,840
What's the latest?

156
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:24,388
Drunken pig.

157
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:27,599
Fat boy.

158
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:30,894
Paralytic.

159
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:36,275
For a drunken paralytic
he's putting up a damn good fight.

160
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:42,281
We'll cut the swine to shreds.
That is my firm belief.

161
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:53,208
Listen, smart guy. Mr. Churchill
is a long way from shreds.

162
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:59,673
I'd like to know how many
of his ships are getting through -

163
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:04,261
- while we sit on our behinds
waiting for orders.

164
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:08,515
Our patrol planes.
Where are they, Herr Goring?

165
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:15,856
The British have plenty of them.
Talking big is all he's good for.

166
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:25,032
Big heroes.
Nothing but hot air ... all of them.

167
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:40,422
Put that one down. It'll make
exciting reading in your epic.

168
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:48,097
The Propaganda Ministry
will love it.

169
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:51,809
Music we need.

170
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:57,606
Do you think our Hitler Youth leader
might put a record on for us?

171
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:04,613
The "Tipperary" song
if you have no objections.

172
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:19,837
- That stuff makes me puke.
- Now we're in the Royal Navy.

173
00:31:30,765 --> 00:31:34,351
A record won't make you
into the king of England.

174
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:53,746
- Shut the door, you lazy pig!
- Stupid jerk!

175
00:31:55,165 --> 00:32:01,378
They should use him as a doorstop,
his rear end's big enough.

176
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:08,844
One day he'll stick it in the can
and he'll never get it out again.

177
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:17,728
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Lieutenant.

178
00:32:18,396 --> 00:32:23,400
- It stinks in here.
- Sweaty feet and hair grease.

179
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:28,155
Pilgrim's specialty.

180
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:40,250
Smells just like old socks ...
these rotten eggs.

181
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:48,967
- Baby poo-poo.
- Pilgrim needs a chicken house.

182
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:53,138
Right. Ducks in the bilge.
Sweet little ducklings.

183
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:58,602
We could fatten them up
with jam from your filthy feet.

184
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:06,568
They'd have good fun
feeding on Frenssen's toe jam.

185
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:42,438
Aid to cleanliness, four letters?

186
00:33:44,232 --> 00:33:47,901
Bath.

187
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:52,531
Thank you.

188
00:33:57,996 --> 00:34:02,541
A desert animal with two humps?

189
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:08,756
- Camel.
- Perfect.

190
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:24,355
Intellectual starvation I would say.

191
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:35,991
It's completed, sir. Signal decoded.

192
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:47,419
One moment.

193
00:35:14,906 --> 00:35:22,746
It could just about do it.
Five, six, seven ...

194
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:28,544
- Eight.
- New course, sir?

195
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:36,051
One minute.

196
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:43,684
What's the signal position, sir?

197
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:52,693
"Convoy square at AK 22,46."

198
00:35:52,861 --> 00:35:58,741
"Mean course: 60 degrees.
Speed: 8 knots. U-boat 37."

199
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:03,787
U-boat 37. That's Marten's boat
moving in to attack.

200
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:14,548
- Too far away. We'd never make it.
- Bad luck.

201
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,971
Damn it!
When do we get some orders?

202
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:35,069
Come on, pull it out!
Slap more grease on it!

203
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:40,366
- For your journal?
- Yes, wonderful stuff.

204
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:43,660
You there, this way a moment.

205
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:49,833
It's nicely greased with vaseline.
We're ready to ram it in!

206
00:36:50,001 --> 00:36:55,506
Can you just look this way?
Yes, good.

207
00:36:57,926 --> 00:37:03,931
Not quite so fast. This way. Great!

208
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:10,145
Stay here in the foreground.
Let's have some with a different ...

209
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:30,416
Who did that?

210
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:23,302
Tell me now ...
Have you got any hairs up your nose?

211
00:38:24,804 --> 00:38:29,433
- Why?
- I've got some up mine.

212
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:33,729
Maybe we could knit them together.

213
00:38:41,112 --> 00:38:47,284
"2nd November, 1941 .
Dear Francoise ..."

214
00:38:59,589 --> 00:39:06,220
"20th day at sea."

215
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:10,974
- Alarm!
- Alarm!

216
00:39:12,477 --> 00:39:17,606
- Hatch secured!
- All main vents open!

217
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:22,903
- Shadow off the starboard beam.
- Take her down 30 metres.

218
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:28,617
Bring her up easy.
Planes on zero.

219
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:34,873
- Anything on the starboard beam?
- Propeller sounds.

220
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:46,719
1 10 degrees.

221
00:39:51,057 --> 00:39:54,852
Way aft of us.

222
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:07,114
Contact growing fainter.

223
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:18,375
Fading fast, sir.

224
00:40:23,757 --> 00:40:32,139
Right ... we'd better stay down now.
Steer 120.

225
00:40:36,561 --> 00:40:42,816
A lone ship traveling fast.
We have no chance in this light.

226
00:41:05,715 --> 00:41:11,220
"It's more than superficial to take
care in personal appearance."

227
00:41:11,388 --> 00:41:16,975
"It denotes that the inner man
is wholesome and upstanding."

228
00:41:17,143 --> 00:41:24,358
"An officer should be unpretentious
in his dress and deportment."

229
00:41:24,526 --> 00:41:29,571
"In the old days young officers
were treated indulgently in this."

230
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:35,327
"Knowing they risked their lives,
their superiors ..."

231
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:38,497
It's comfortable here.

232
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:42,668
No mail. No telephone.

233
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:49,299
A well-ventilated boat.
Solid wood panelling.

234
00:41:52,137 --> 00:41:57,599
Free food, too.
We're in clover here.

235
00:41:57,767 --> 00:42:01,979
Like fresh horse droppings.

236
00:42:02,147 --> 00:42:08,485
They're rolling in clover, too.
No need to work.

237
00:42:08,653 --> 00:42:12,865
They're even allowed to smoke.

238
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:38,849
U-boat special cocktail.
Want some?

239
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:52,738
Stop that!

240
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:16,804
Our recent triumphs.

241
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:21,016
"Dived to evade enemy aircraft."

242
00:43:21,184 --> 00:43:27,523
"Dived to avoid destroyer.
Depth charged."

243
00:43:33,446 --> 00:43:37,449
The British
have stopped making mistakes.

244
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:49,378
Cut off extra supply of fuel
to the engines!

245
00:43:52,757 --> 00:43:58,971
Torpedo rooms ...
check the gyro-angles.

246
00:44:05,729 --> 00:44:12,818
- Watch out!
- Check periscope alignment.

247
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:18,824
- What's going on?
- Here we go, girls.

248
00:44:18,992 --> 00:44:24,496
U-32 has spotted a British convoy.
We should be there in 10 hours.

249
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:37,551
U-32 is operating against a convoy.
We are joining in the hunt.

250
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:42,348
Contact expected
any time after 18:00 hours.

251
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:46,685
These beauties
are ready for blast off.

252
00:44:48,396 --> 00:44:52,316
Over 30 freighters.

253
00:44:52,484 --> 00:44:57,905
Berthold is waiting for us to
arrive. He's following the convoy.

254
00:45:00,909 --> 00:45:05,996
For me it's the best thrill
with U-boats and sailing ships.

255
00:45:06,164 --> 00:45:09,416
Skimming across the sea.

256
00:45:09,584 --> 00:45:17,091
I've sailed on a schooner.
Roomy. Holds as big as churches.

257
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:29,645
- That's a fine way to waste fuel.
- Lunatic!

258
00:45:36,277 --> 00:45:39,321
Damn this weather!

259
00:45:45,453 --> 00:45:50,082
We could pass the British completely
without seeing them.

260
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:57,631
We should be within range.
Why doesn't Berthold signal us?

261
00:45:59,092 --> 00:46:04,138
Why haven't we heard from H.Q.?

262
00:46:06,016 --> 00:46:10,978
Visibility is nil, sir.
It's useless!

263
00:46:16,901 --> 00:46:20,362
Prepare to dive!

264
00:46:23,324 --> 00:46:26,869
Clear the bridge now!

265
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:37,171
Diving positions.
Stand by main vents.

266
00:47:06,284 --> 00:47:12,748
- Take her down 30 metres.
- Bow planes up 10. Stern down 5.

267
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:19,213
Bow planes zero. Stern zero.

268
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:23,884
What's up? Why are we diving?

269
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:26,887
A hydrophone check.

270
00:47:27,055 --> 00:47:32,059
In bad weather you can hear more
than you can see on the surface.

271
00:47:32,227 --> 00:47:37,981
Stern planes up 5.
Easy. Both planes zero.

272
00:48:10,765 --> 00:48:14,643
Can't you make a contact?

273
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:29,158
Nothing?

274
00:49:16,956 --> 00:49:20,751
Captain, come here.

275
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:27,633
Contact bearing 060. Quite faint.

276
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,026
Depth charges.

277
00:49:47,612 --> 00:49:51,699
They are blasting someone.

278
00:49:57,205 --> 00:50:01,500
What's the bearing from us now.

279
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:09,925
Moving right. 045 degrees.

280
00:50:10,093 --> 00:50:13,929
Moving away from us.

281
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:25,399
- Surface. Steer 330.
- All ahead two-thirds.

282
00:50:25,567 --> 00:50:31,613
Note this in our log book. Despite
bad weather, commencing operation.

283
00:51:03,438 --> 00:51:09,318
Damn this stinking weather!
How does it look?

284
00:51:12,155 --> 00:51:20,454
- The enemy should be here.
- Freighter on the starboard bow.

285
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:32,007
- Over there! 040 and closing.
- Damn it!

286
00:51:37,722 --> 00:51:44,812
That's no freighter.
Oh no! A destroyer!

287
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,609
It's coming straight at us.
Clear the bridge.

288
00:51:56,324 --> 00:51:59,785
Take her down!

289
00:52:03,957 --> 00:52:06,375
Diving stations.

290
00:52:08,753 --> 00:52:15,300
- Come to periscope depth.
- All planes up 10.

291
00:52:27,981 --> 00:52:31,900
Steady at 2 metres.

292
00:52:35,905 --> 00:52:38,866
Both planes zero.

293
00:52:44,247 --> 00:52:48,709
Stern down 5.

294
00:52:49,044 --> 00:52:52,963
Come up.

295
00:53:13,651 --> 00:53:17,905
- Stand by battle stations.
- Stand by battle stations.

296
00:53:18,073 --> 00:53:22,201
- Stand by battle stations.
- Out of the way, damn it!

297
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:25,662
Gangway!

298
00:53:27,332 --> 00:53:31,043
Faster! Faster!

299
00:53:38,593 --> 00:53:42,012
Keep her level, Chief.

300
00:53:50,021 --> 00:53:56,860
- Flood tubes one to four.
- Flood tubes one to four.

301
00:53:57,737 --> 00:54:03,992
He wants to attack the destroyer.
Crazy in this weather.

302
00:54:05,995 --> 00:54:11,834
- Watch your depth, Chief.
- Bow planes up 2. Stern down 2.

303
00:54:15,213 --> 00:54:18,799
Come on.

304
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:25,180
Both planes come to zero.
1 3.5 metres.

305
00:54:26,975 --> 00:54:30,936
Open bow caps now.

306
00:54:43,491 --> 00:54:51,123
Enemy's speed: 10.
Range: 6,000.

307
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:54,501
Depth: 2 metres.

308
00:54:54,669 --> 00:55:01,216
Torpedo speed: 40.
Spread torpedoes one and three.

309
00:55:01,384 --> 00:55:04,762
Spread shots one and three.

310
00:55:05,555 --> 00:55:09,850
Tubes one through four are ready.

311
00:55:32,665 --> 00:55:37,920
Damn it! What happened to them?

312
00:55:53,645 --> 00:55:56,313
Close bow caps! Dive!

313
00:56:04,447 --> 00:56:09,410
Depth charges dropped.

314
00:56:21,006 --> 00:56:26,969
- Get some fuses, quick!
- Check all valves and closures.

315
00:56:53,329 --> 00:56:56,957
No serious damage.

316
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:04,381
They must've spotted our periscope.

317
00:57:04,549 --> 00:57:10,262
- Control room all secure.
- lncredible in this sea.

318
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:44,338
- Is it getting louder?
- It seems constant. Ahead of us.

319
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:51,387
280.

320
00:58:00,021 --> 00:58:06,318
280 minus 35 ...

321
00:58:12,784 --> 00:58:19,665
- It's pulling further ahead. 295.
- Left full rudder.

322
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:28,340
- Rudder is left full.
- Steer due north.

323
00:58:28,508 --> 00:58:32,678
- Deeper, Chief.
- Bow planes down 1 5. Stern up 10.

324
00:58:32,846 --> 00:58:39,768
- Pump 200 litres forward.
- Steering due north, sir.

325
00:58:41,855 --> 00:58:48,819
- 200 litres forward.
- Main motors ahead one-third.

326
00:58:53,992 --> 00:58:57,578
Now it gets psychological, friends.

327
00:59:56,930 --> 01:00:01,684
Easy, men.
There's more to come yet.

328
01:00:15,031 --> 01:00:19,201
Kill unnecessary lights.

329
01:00:24,457 --> 01:00:30,170
- Silent speed.
- Both main engines at 50 rpm.

330
01:00:30,338 --> 01:00:33,966
Both engines indicate 50 rpm.

331
01:00:47,647 --> 01:00:54,445
Contact coming closer.
Starboard bow. Closing fast.

332
01:00:54,612 --> 01:00:59,199
Main engines full ahead.
Right full rudder.

333
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:05,706
Both main engines ahead full.

334
01:01:23,641 --> 01:01:28,020
They're coming straight for us.

335
01:01:36,821 --> 01:01:43,327
- He knows what he's doing. Deeper.
- Bow down 20. Stern up 5.

336
01:02:16,778 --> 01:02:22,700
- Destroyer almost above us.
- Deeper, Chief. Quick.

337
01:02:29,708 --> 01:02:34,003
DEPTH GAUGE

338
01:02:41,219 --> 01:02:45,597
Don't be afraid.
It's only the pressure.

339
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:58,736
- Deeper.
- Stern up 1 5.

340
01:03:21,551 --> 01:03:24,720
1 50 metres.

341
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:30,225
Hurry!

342
01:03:31,853 --> 01:03:38,776
- Tighten that flange.
- Bring her up to 1 50 metres.

343
01:03:38,943 --> 01:03:43,364
Forward up 20. Stern down.10.

344
01:03:43,531 --> 01:03:51,246
Come on, Frenssen, quickly!
Get the damn thing tightened!

345
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:17,856
Hull valves secured.
Both planes read zero.

346
01:04:20,527 --> 01:04:24,738
Level at 1 50 metres.

347
01:04:35,792 --> 01:04:41,547
Becoming louder.
She's turned around. 055.

348
01:04:51,016 --> 01:04:54,977
Go on, get it over.

349
01:04:59,649 --> 01:05:03,402
Contact closing fast.

350
01:05:10,952 --> 01:05:17,291
They are above us ...
just above us.

351
01:05:44,861 --> 01:05:48,906
Contact fading to starboard.

352
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:01,960
22.

353
01:06:08,593 --> 01:06:12,805
- 23.
- They are far away.

354
01:06:21,189 --> 01:06:24,900
Contact receding aft.

355
01:06:31,908 --> 01:06:35,994
I can barely hear it.

356
01:06:53,805 --> 01:06:58,684
- Now?
- It has passed us by.

357
01:07:10,196 --> 01:07:13,490
I think that will be all, this time.

358
01:07:17,996 --> 01:07:23,792
- Silent speed.
- Both main engines 50 rpm.

359
01:07:26,296 --> 01:07:35,596
- Both main engines 50 rpm.
- All compartments report damage.

360
01:07:56,743 --> 01:07:59,995
From my private collection.

361
01:08:13,468 --> 01:08:17,596
- How is the engine room?
- Smashed up badly.

362
01:08:17,764 --> 01:08:22,976
- Will you be able to patch her up?
- I've already started.

363
01:08:23,144 --> 01:08:29,316
Make it good. I've got a feeling
we're going to see some action.

364
01:08:40,787 --> 01:08:43,997
Nothing?

365
01:08:59,764 --> 01:09:06,061
- We've waited over an hour now.
- I guess we have shaken them off.

366
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:13,193
Don't be too sure. He could
have stopped and be waiting -

367
01:09:13,361 --> 01:09:21,326
- to surprise us when we surface.
Not dumb, the British.

368
01:09:21,494 --> 01:09:25,873
Stay on silent speed.
When it's dark, we'll surface.

369
01:09:26,041 --> 01:09:29,293
I see better in the dark.

370
01:09:29,461 --> 01:09:32,129
Captain.

371
01:09:35,717 --> 01:09:38,260
Thanks.

372
01:09:46,311 --> 01:09:52,483
- What's it like up top?
- It's dark.

373
01:09:54,527 --> 01:10:01,325
- Go up to 30 metres.
- Bow planes up 1 5. Stern up 5.

374
01:10:01,493 --> 01:10:05,704
90, 80 ...

375
01:10:05,872 --> 01:10:10,584
70, 60 metres.

376
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:15,214
50. Coming up fast.

377
01:10:15,799 --> 01:10:23,138
- Sound check at 30.
- She's level at 30 metres.

378
01:10:34,317 --> 01:10:37,444
Well?

379
01:10:40,907 --> 01:10:44,410
Periscope depth.

380
01:10:48,581 --> 01:10:54,795
Bow up 3.
Stern down five.

381
01:10:58,675 --> 01:11:01,635
Zero.

382
01:11:15,483 --> 01:11:19,403
- Surface.
- All set to blow.

383
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:17,336
Cut it out! All this damn noise!

384
01:12:23,468 --> 01:12:29,306
- I've got bad news, men.
- What's up now?

385
01:12:31,017 --> 01:12:34,395
Our team is losing.

386
01:12:36,439 --> 01:12:40,150
5-0.

387
01:12:42,445 --> 01:12:46,198
Not a chance
of making the finals now.

388
01:12:46,366 --> 01:12:49,952
It can't be! I don't believe it!

389
01:12:58,670 --> 01:13:02,131
Drop 'em!

390
01:13:23,737 --> 01:13:27,489
You dirty little boy. Crabs!

391
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:34,163
A whole army of them. They'll eat
your winkie down to the bone.

392
01:13:38,084 --> 01:13:41,837
Give him a go with gun powder!

393
01:13:46,843 --> 01:13:50,554
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

394
01:14:14,037 --> 01:14:18,290
This meat needs a shave.

395
01:14:22,212 --> 01:14:27,424
What are those things
crawling about on your eyebrows?

396
01:14:27,592 --> 01:14:32,221
- Pardon?
- You'd better see the medic.

397
01:14:32,389 --> 01:14:36,308
Crabs by the look of them.

398
01:14:41,898 --> 01:14:48,237
When the creatures begin to surface,
it's the fifth stage.

399
01:14:58,289 --> 01:15:04,545
- Get it all in the torpedo room.
- You two, give me a hand.

400
01:15:08,258 --> 01:15:12,720
Bosun,
do you know where the medic is?

401
01:15:12,887 --> 01:15:16,598
Yeah, in the bow compartment.

402
01:15:19,477 --> 01:15:24,106
- The more the merrier.
- Have the crabs got you, too?

403
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:49,590
- Lieutenant!
- What?

404
01:15:49,758 --> 01:15:56,305
Take it easy! Calm down!
Have you gone crazy?

405
01:16:01,353 --> 01:16:06,190
Have you heard the latest?
Our Dufte is tying the knot.

406
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:13,155
- The stupid pig.
- Half the fleet have tried her.

407
01:16:13,323 --> 01:16:17,493
They should stick you in a zoo
with a chimpanzee.

408
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:24,333
- Here's the pictures of her!
- You dirty, rotten swine!

409
01:16:27,962 --> 01:16:32,966
Don't tell me this hag
lets you sleep with her.

410
01:17:11,423 --> 01:17:18,595
These boats are built to take it.
You should try a sailing ship.

411
01:17:19,639 --> 01:17:22,558
You hardly feel a thing down here.

412
01:17:33,278 --> 01:17:36,447
- Captain.
- Compass.

413
01:17:48,335 --> 01:17:52,546
She's heaving to starboard.
I can't keep on course.

414
01:17:53,214 --> 01:17:57,217
No cause for concern.

415
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:06,643
It's pointless, sir.
We're burning up fuel for nothing.

416
01:18:13,109 --> 01:18:16,153
Prepare to dive.

417
01:18:16,321 --> 01:18:21,158
Diving stations.
Stand by all main vents.

418
01:19:22,012 --> 01:19:26,140
Nothing exciting out there?

419
01:19:28,643 --> 01:19:35,941
Position reports and very faint
SOS calls from enemy freighters.

420
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:43,574
When the rudder breaks
on one of those old tenders ...

421
01:19:47,162 --> 01:19:50,956
... there's nothing to do but pray.

422
01:19:54,961 --> 01:20:02,176
The sea can't sink us, Hinrich.
No ships are as safe as our U-boats.

423
01:20:14,022 --> 01:20:16,940
Hinrich.

424
01:20:17,108 --> 01:20:23,697
Put the record on again.
You know the one.

425
01:21:35,228 --> 01:21:37,563
Watch out!

426
01:21:48,283 --> 01:21:50,576
Look out!

427
01:21:56,291 --> 01:21:58,959
Man overboard!

428
01:22:01,588 --> 01:22:04,548
Pilgrim!

429
01:22:08,178 --> 01:22:10,888
Hold on!

430
01:22:36,456 --> 01:22:41,752
- Get his legs.
- I've got him. Make way!

431
01:22:43,129 --> 01:22:48,008
- His legs!
- Hurry, will you? Move!

432
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:53,722
- Lay him out flat.
- Get his hood off quickly.

433
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:57,142
Pilgrim.

434
01:22:57,310 --> 01:23:02,773
Bring the first-aid kit, damn it!

435
01:23:02,941 --> 01:23:05,526
Prepare to dive.

436
01:23:14,786 --> 01:23:20,332
"Self-discipline is the only road
to military leadership ..."

437
01:23:22,794 --> 01:23:27,464
Three ribs cracked
and a gash on the head.

438
01:23:27,632 --> 01:23:30,801
He was lucky.

439
01:23:31,886 --> 01:23:38,559
What a rotten month.
Absolutely rotten.

440
01:23:39,936 --> 01:23:43,147
Mildew is good for you.

441
01:23:45,942 --> 01:23:52,072
It's the next best thing to ...
fresh-grown lettuce.

442
01:23:54,951 --> 01:24:01,665
Anything that grows on this boat
we've got to be grateful for.

443
01:24:07,797 --> 01:24:11,675
It must be snowing already
back home.

444
01:24:18,266 --> 01:24:21,226
Very funny.

445
01:24:22,896 --> 01:24:26,065
It's been years since I saw snow.

446
01:24:29,402 --> 01:24:32,946
- Can I look?
- Sure.

447
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:48,837
Your wife?

448
01:25:53,486 --> 01:25:57,740
Look! There, in front!

449
01:26:02,454 --> 01:26:06,373
Captain, U-boat on port bow.

450
01:26:07,667 --> 01:26:11,420
It's one of ours.

451
01:26:14,507 --> 01:26:20,220
A German U-boat! Over there!

452
01:26:25,894 --> 01:26:29,563
You're right.

453
01:26:29,731 --> 01:26:34,651
- Both engines stop.
- Bring up the lights.

454
01:27:05,642 --> 01:27:09,436
Look, it's Thomsen!

455
01:27:10,397 --> 01:27:15,275
- All back.
- It's Thomsen!

456
01:27:29,666 --> 01:27:34,628
Good hunting, you old rascal!

457
01:27:42,846 --> 01:27:49,226
My God, Phillip!
So they pushed you out to sea again.

458
01:27:55,775 --> 01:27:59,611
Damn it! How can this happen?

459
01:28:02,157 --> 01:28:09,038
12 boats we've got on the Atlantic,
from Greenland to the Azores.

460
01:28:09,205 --> 01:28:14,918
But still we almost collide
with one of our own.

461
01:28:15,086 --> 01:28:19,965
60 metres. Boat is trimmed, sir.

462
01:28:22,344 --> 01:28:26,138
Something is wrong here.

463
01:28:28,099 --> 01:28:32,436
- Have you checked on our position?
- More or less.

464
01:28:32,604 --> 01:28:36,357
More or less is not good enough!

465
01:28:36,524 --> 01:28:43,238
We've not had a sun shot in 14 days.
We've been drifting in this storm.

466
01:28:43,406 --> 01:28:47,242
It's hard to compute.

467
01:28:53,625 --> 01:29:01,298
If we make an error in our position,
and the others do the same, -

468
01:29:01,466 --> 01:29:05,969
- we end up playing collision games.
The route is wide open.

469
01:29:06,137 --> 01:29:11,975
The British could shove
the whole armada through.

470
01:29:12,143 --> 01:29:15,396
Yeah, yeah ...

471
01:29:18,108 --> 01:29:23,153
Another story in the middle
of the ocean, Lieutenant.

472
01:29:23,321 --> 01:29:29,284
I hope you're making notes. Maybe
headquarters will listen to you.

473
01:29:29,452 --> 01:29:36,959
- You've more influence than I have.
- So ... you believe that?

474
01:29:50,765 --> 01:29:57,980
Have you got your flashlight ready?
It's bound to be a false alarm.

475
01:30:05,447 --> 01:30:10,451
- What's up?
- A convoy.

476
01:30:24,299 --> 01:30:29,428
- Permission to come up?
- Permitted.

477
01:31:16,101 --> 01:31:22,940
Outward bound convoy. Five columns.
Very juicy.

478
01:31:26,444 --> 01:31:30,489
Any escorts in sight? Destroyers?

479
01:31:30,657 --> 01:31:36,328
No, no screen.
They have no protection. Nothing.

480
01:31:41,501 --> 01:31:44,044
That's funny.

481
01:31:45,964 --> 01:31:51,301
They could be off
chasing one of ours.

482
01:31:57,976 --> 01:32:01,770
That damn moon!

483
01:32:04,065 --> 01:32:08,902
- How many of our boats are here?
- Five.

484
01:32:11,531 --> 01:32:14,658
Do we risk it?

485
01:32:16,703 --> 01:32:20,914
It's worth a try, Captain.

486
01:32:22,125 --> 01:32:24,877
Come left to 180.

487
01:32:25,045 --> 01:32:29,340
Left 5 degrees rudder.
New course: 180.

488
01:32:29,507 --> 01:32:33,218
Steady on course 180.

489
01:32:34,095 --> 01:32:38,223
Kriechbaum, what's your feeling?

490
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:44,229
It'll work. We've got them.

491
01:32:55,992 --> 01:33:01,246
Prepare tubes one to four
for surface firing.

492
01:33:01,414 --> 01:33:06,752
- I'm going in.
- Master-sight to bridge.

493
01:33:09,547 --> 01:33:12,675
Tubes one to four flooded.

494
01:33:26,022 --> 01:33:30,818
All ahead full. Left full rudder.
Stand by to attack!

495
01:33:35,281 --> 01:33:39,451
Watch the pressure
of the lubricating oil.

496
01:33:40,912 --> 01:33:45,916
- Bearing: 050.
- Locked on.

497
01:33:46,084 --> 01:33:49,044
Range: 2,200 metres.

498
01:33:49,212 --> 01:33:55,843
Those two over that way.
Then we'll drop on the big one.

499
01:33:56,011 --> 01:34:02,766
- Targets identified.
- Open the bow caps.

500
01:34:02,934 --> 01:34:09,732
Lock on tubes one and two.
New bow angle: 063.

501
01:34:09,899 --> 01:34:14,028
Follow for bearing.

502
01:34:14,195 --> 01:34:20,743
Tubes one and two,
fire when matched.

503
01:34:20,910 --> 01:34:23,412
Tube one, fire!

504
01:34:25,749 --> 01:34:30,711
Tube two, fire!

505
01:34:30,879 --> 01:34:35,591
- Tube three, fire when matched.
- Tube three ready.

506
01:34:35,759 --> 01:34:39,470
Tube three, fire!

507
01:34:40,096 --> 01:34:47,102
Tube four ready.
Tube four, fire!

508
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:50,272
Destroyer ahead!

509
01:34:53,693 --> 01:34:56,695
Alarm!

510
01:34:56,863 --> 01:35:01,575
All men forward! Diving positions!

511
01:35:03,787 --> 01:35:07,331
Quick, keep it moving!

512
01:35:07,499 --> 01:35:12,378
- Clear the way.
- Move, move, move!

513
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:28,602
- Battle stations!
- Out of the way.

514
01:35:29,312 --> 01:35:35,859
Bow planes up 10. Stern up 5.

515
01:35:36,653 --> 01:35:39,988
Keep quite!

516
01:35:40,615 --> 01:35:44,576
Down 80 metres. Easy.

517
01:35:44,744 --> 01:35:50,290
Bow down 1 5. Stern up 10.

518
01:35:52,836 --> 01:35:58,465
- What about the torpedoes?
- Any minute now.

519
01:36:03,096 --> 01:36:06,640
Not long to go now.

520
01:36:06,808 --> 01:36:09,810
1 10 ...

521
01:36:16,818 --> 01:36:22,698
- 120.
- Those torpedoes don't run true.

522
01:36:22,866 --> 01:36:30,664
It was crazy to attack like that.
That destroy won't let us go.

523
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:36,128
He'll try and hunt us down.

524
01:36:43,345 --> 01:36:49,016
- We hit the first.
- Out of the way. We hit her!

525
01:36:50,101 --> 01:36:53,145
Quiet!

526
01:37:15,502 --> 01:37:19,588
Time's up for the third torpedo.

527
01:37:24,344 --> 01:37:27,221
Number three.

528
01:37:42,362 --> 01:37:45,989
Now they are going to the bottom.

529
01:37:58,336 --> 01:38:02,423
It's the bulkheads.
They've collapsed.

530
01:38:19,649 --> 01:38:22,776
This is it.

531
01:38:26,531 --> 01:38:29,700
Now we have the payoff.

532
01:38:39,127 --> 01:38:45,841
Destroyer bearing 044.
Moving left. Fading, sir.

533
01:39:00,690 --> 01:39:05,819
Right full rudder.
Both engines ahead two-thirds.

534
01:39:05,987 --> 01:39:11,700
Rudder's right full.
Both engines ahead two-thirds.

535
01:39:11,868 --> 01:39:15,788
They're astern of us ...

536
01:39:17,207 --> 01:39:21,168
... way astern of us.

537
01:39:23,630 --> 01:39:27,591
They're spitting
in the wrong direction.

538
01:39:35,392 --> 01:39:41,980
We haven't thrown them off yet.
I reckon they won't be too happy.

539
01:39:42,148 --> 01:39:49,029
Propeller noises bearing 270.
Closing.

540
01:39:49,989 --> 01:39:55,119
Both engines ahead one-third.

541
01:40:01,876 --> 01:40:07,881
- Both engines ahead one-third.
- Now we'll see.

542
01:40:34,534 --> 01:40:40,706
All ahead full.
Pump out 1 50 litres.

543
01:40:44,711 --> 01:40:48,505
Pump out 1 50 litres. Ahead full!

544
01:41:43,019 --> 01:41:49,108
Asdic detection system.
Ultrasonic.

545
01:41:54,239 --> 01:41:59,410
The filthy rotten swine!

546
01:42:11,381 --> 01:42:17,011
- What's the damage?
- Air shaft fractured.

547
01:42:21,307 --> 01:42:25,686
Quiet, boys.

548
01:42:27,022 --> 01:42:30,733
Nice and quiet now.

549
01:43:17,238 --> 01:43:22,201
- Hold that speed.
- 50 rpm.

550
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:26,914
Left 1 5 degrees.

551
01:43:28,792 --> 01:43:32,670
Steering left 1 5, sir.

552
01:43:45,558 --> 01:43:49,228
All ahead full!

553
01:43:50,980 --> 01:43:54,149
Let's get the hell out of here!

554
01:43:59,739 --> 01:44:05,953
- One of the valves is fractured!
- Isolate it!

555
01:44:09,833 --> 01:44:13,502
God! We're on fire!

556
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:19,049
Cut the number two auxiliary!

557
01:44:22,929 --> 01:44:26,765
Calm down for God's sake!

558
01:44:51,583 --> 01:44:59,340
- Chief, emergency ventilation.
- Switch on fans.

559
01:45:27,869 --> 01:45:33,499
She doesn't want to let go of us.

560
01:45:41,841 --> 01:45:47,012
What's going on? Running away?

561
01:46:01,277 --> 01:46:09,368
We really smashed them.
Did you hear those bulkheads burst?

562
01:46:22,215 --> 01:46:28,929
- What's her bearing?
- 065. Bearing constant.

563
01:46:32,308 --> 01:46:36,937
Deeper, Chief. Silent speed.

564
01:47:01,171 --> 01:47:04,256
Bearing?

565
01:47:05,342 --> 01:47:10,346
050. Growing louder.

566
01:47:22,025 --> 01:47:25,736
Yeah, yeah ...

567
01:47:31,576 --> 01:47:34,578
Yeah, sure.

568
01:47:43,922 --> 01:47:48,592
Deeper still. Right 30 degrees.

569
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:55,599
We'll try doubling back.
Keep them guessing.

570
01:48:02,732 --> 01:48:07,528
Bow planes steady. Stern up 10.

571
01:48:55,035 --> 01:48:59,413
Contact bearing 270.

572
01:49:01,082 --> 01:49:05,002
It's fading.

573
01:49:18,975 --> 01:49:25,898
- Right full rudder.
- Rudder is full right, sir.

574
01:49:26,566 --> 01:49:30,944
Steer 090.

575
01:49:48,338 --> 01:49:50,464
No!

576
01:49:52,175 --> 01:49:56,887
Second contact closing fast.
Bearing: 076.

577
01:49:59,933 --> 01:50:03,435
Damn them!

578
01:50:04,729 --> 01:50:08,607
Another one.

579
01:50:38,388 --> 01:50:43,392
- Deeper.
- Sir ..?

580
01:50:44,811 --> 01:50:48,480
Yes, deeper.

581
01:50:51,401 --> 01:50:54,903
Bow planes down 10. Stern up 7.

582
01:51:13,131 --> 01:51:17,343
190 metres.

583
01:51:26,394 --> 01:51:28,520
200 metres.

584
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:43,160
210 metres.

585
01:51:51,294 --> 01:51:54,380
220 metres.

586
01:52:00,887 --> 01:52:04,014
230 metres.

587
01:52:14,776 --> 01:52:19,571
- The bolts are bursting!
- 10 metres rise.

588
01:52:19,739 --> 01:52:23,492
All ahead.

589
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:32,209
Quiet, men!

590
01:53:00,488 --> 01:53:03,240
Quiet.

591
01:53:12,542 --> 01:53:18,047
Bring her up to 1 50 metres!
Full ahead!

592
01:53:20,342 --> 01:53:23,969
Full ahead both, sir.

593
01:53:24,137 --> 01:53:29,641
Left 20 degrees.
Steer 050.

594
01:53:29,809 --> 01:53:33,228
He is near his mark.

595
01:53:37,275 --> 01:53:40,861
The foundation bolts are loose!

596
01:54:12,310 --> 01:54:19,566
- I want accurate damage reports.
- Water's pouring in!

597
01:54:24,197 --> 01:54:30,411
- The engine room is leaking water!
- I'll go and take a look.

598
01:54:30,578 --> 01:54:33,831
Number One, take over.

599
01:54:35,959 --> 01:54:38,711
It's the exhaust flap.

600
01:54:38,878 --> 01:54:44,967
- The plunge bolts have sheared.
- The gaskets!

601
01:54:46,845 --> 01:54:50,764
Bring me new gaskets. Move it!

602
01:54:51,433 --> 01:54:57,062
- Torpedo hatch taking water.
- Give us some light.

603
01:55:00,483 --> 01:55:04,528
Crow bar!

604
01:55:09,367 --> 01:55:13,287
They'll soon be out of ammunition.

605
01:55:28,094 --> 01:55:31,847
The exhaust flap is secured, sir.

606
01:55:32,015 --> 01:55:38,812
- 50 metres. All ahead full.
- Torpedo hatch is secured.

607
01:55:53,411 --> 01:55:56,705
What's wrong, Johann?

608
01:56:02,379 --> 01:56:08,592
Get back to your battle station,
right now.

609
01:56:18,478 --> 01:56:24,817
Don't disobey my orders.
Do as you're told!

610
01:56:28,154 --> 01:56:32,032
I order you, Johann.

611
01:56:33,618 --> 01:56:37,413
Aft, Johann!

612
01:56:42,836 --> 01:56:49,383
Take him aft, boys.
Hold him down.

613
01:56:55,265 --> 01:56:58,767
He's under control.

614
01:57:38,808 --> 01:57:44,563
Who'd have thought it of Johann?

615
01:57:45,190 --> 01:57:50,903
Degrading. Shameful.

616
01:58:09,923 --> 01:58:14,927
Forget it, Hinrich.
We can hear them.

617
01:58:38,493 --> 01:58:40,285
That's it. Come on.

618
01:59:00,765 --> 01:59:03,767
170 metres.

619
01:59:06,354 --> 01:59:10,149
190 metres.

620
01:59:12,277 --> 01:59:15,070
200.

621
01:59:38,178 --> 01:59:43,891
- Man your stations.
- 220 metres!

622
01:59:44,059 --> 01:59:51,231
We're sinking!

623
02:00:56,589 --> 02:01:02,720
- Make a note for the war diary.
- Aye-aye, Captain.

624
02:01:04,014 --> 02:01:10,978
Stayed submerged for six hours
at silent speed.

625
02:01:11,146 --> 02:01:15,274
Satisfied
the destroyers have lost us.

626
02:01:16,526 --> 02:01:23,991
Intense glow in sky
observed at 210 degrees.

627
02:01:24,159 --> 02:01:29,288
Probably flames
from the tanker we hit.

628
02:01:36,379 --> 02:01:43,510
- We'll surface in ten minutes.
- Switch to red light.

629
02:01:49,684 --> 02:01:53,354
First watch, stand by for duty.

630
02:02:18,338 --> 02:02:21,548
You see, Lieutenant ...

631
02:02:23,551 --> 02:02:27,388
... they didn't kill us.

632
02:03:32,954 --> 02:03:36,540
Her back's already broken.

633
02:03:38,668 --> 02:03:43,047
She is a tough one.
She won't go down.

634
02:03:44,966 --> 02:03:52,639
Let's finish her off.
A final shot. Prepare to fire.

635
02:03:53,725 --> 02:03:59,313
Number one tube is flooded.
Ready for surface firing.

636
02:03:59,481 --> 02:04:05,611
Target's speed: Zero.
Range: 650 metres.

637
02:04:05,779 --> 02:04:09,948
Depth: Four metres.
Torpedo speed: 30.

638
02:04:10,116 --> 02:04:14,703
Aiming point: Forward of aft mast.

639
02:04:14,871 --> 02:04:18,582
Tube one ready.

640
02:04:18,750 --> 02:04:22,294
Tube one ... Fire!

641
02:05:05,380 --> 02:05:09,466
- There are still men on board.
- There!

642
02:05:20,395 --> 02:05:25,232
Why didn't their own ships
rescue them?

643
02:05:25,400 --> 02:05:28,235
They've had six hours.

644
02:05:54,429 --> 02:06:01,143
- They're swimming towards us.
- Both engines back two-thirds.

645
02:06:01,311 --> 02:06:04,938
We can't take prisoners.
You know that.

646
02:07:17,345 --> 02:07:21,223
May I clear the table, sir?

647
02:07:46,416 --> 02:07:49,835
Here, take it.

648
02:07:53,256 --> 02:07:57,760
- Some more signals, sir.
- Go ahead.

649
02:07:57,927 --> 02:08:02,681
"Three freighters sunk.
Convoy dispersed into groups."

650
02:08:02,849 --> 02:08:08,604
Contact broken.
Closing course: 030. U-1 12.

651
02:08:10,023 --> 02:08:13,692
Wenzel ... not bad.

652
02:08:13,860 --> 02:08:20,991
Kupsch is on the same convoy.
Stackmann torpedoed a 6,000 tonner.

653
02:08:23,620 --> 02:08:28,874
They're having a field day.
Any hope of joining them?

654
02:08:31,961 --> 02:08:37,549
Difficult. A minimum
of five hours away at full speed.

655
02:08:37,717 --> 02:08:42,262
- We can't make it.
- Yes, yes!

656
02:09:04,869 --> 02:09:08,539
Sir, when do we go back?

657
02:09:14,629 --> 02:09:20,384
When it's time for us to go back ...
and not before, Kriechbaum.

658
02:09:52,625 --> 02:09:57,671
"Fired at 950 metres.
Targeted aft mast."

659
02:09:57,839 --> 02:10:02,009
"Crew was still on board.
Swam toward U-96."

660
02:10:37,587 --> 02:10:40,964
Captain ...

661
02:10:43,009 --> 02:10:49,640
- I wish to apologize.
- There's nothing to be said.

662
02:10:50,642 --> 02:10:57,606
You deserted your post at a critical
moment and disobeyed a direct order.

663
02:11:09,953 --> 02:11:16,375
You mean to say that
there has to be a court martial?

664
02:11:20,672 --> 02:11:25,467
- How many patrols have you done?
- Nine, sir.

665
02:11:31,474 --> 02:11:34,393
Why you, Johann?

666
02:11:37,355 --> 02:11:43,193
It was a mistake.
I didn't ... It was ...

667
02:11:43,361 --> 02:11:46,321
It ...

668
02:11:49,325 --> 02:11:56,206
All of a sudden ... As if ...

669
02:11:59,252 --> 02:12:04,882
It won't ever happen again, sir.
You can depend on it.

670
02:12:06,384 --> 02:12:13,307
- I swear.
- All right, Johann.

671
02:12:14,809 --> 02:12:20,189
Then there's no court martial?

672
02:12:23,651 --> 02:12:27,529
Get some sleep.

673
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:45,923
Decision, return to La Rochelle.

674
02:13:03,566 --> 02:13:06,610
Cipher officer.

675
02:13:11,908 --> 02:13:16,286
- Have you found the problem?
- It's the bulkhead conduit.

676
02:13:16,454 --> 02:13:20,040
Good, get it fixed.

677
02:13:21,584 --> 02:13:24,670
Good morning.

678
02:13:24,838 --> 02:13:29,258
Get moving.
There's a signal to be decoded.

679
02:13:36,433 --> 02:13:42,771
Suppose it's top secret.
Another wild goose chase.

680
02:13:42,939 --> 02:13:47,276
They're not much use to us.
This relic needs a refit.

681
02:13:47,444 --> 02:13:52,364
On the fuel we've got
we won't even make La Rochelle.

682
02:13:52,532 --> 02:13:57,536
We'll hoist a sail.
Don't worry, Chief.

683
02:13:59,330 --> 02:14:03,208
Decoded it yet?

684
02:14:04,753 --> 02:14:11,133
- What is it?
- Top secret. For the captain only.

685
02:14:35,241 --> 02:14:39,995
Very strange.
It's triple enciphered.

686
02:14:47,170 --> 02:14:52,132
Christmas in La Rochelle.
Real girls in Christmas stockings.

687
02:14:52,300 --> 02:14:58,055
Sexy little nurses
to comfort and kiss.

688
02:14:58,223 --> 02:15:03,811
- We'll have a ball!
- A Valkyrie, big and fat.

689
02:15:04,729 --> 02:15:10,651
Now here this.
La Rochelle is out. I'm sorry.

690
02:15:10,819 --> 02:15:18,367
We have a new destination.
La Spezia Naval Base in ltaly.

691
02:15:18,535 --> 02:15:25,666
We'll pick up fuel and supplies
at Vigo in Spain. That's all.

692
02:15:28,461 --> 02:15:33,632
Swine. He must be crazy.

693
02:15:34,426 --> 02:15:39,263
- What a rotten trick.
- There goes our Christmas stocking.

694
02:15:39,431 --> 02:15:46,937
- No sexy little nurses.
- I'd like to kill those morons!

695
02:15:47,105 --> 02:15:52,526
- We'll have Christmas in ltaly.
- We've got to get there first!

696
02:15:52,694 --> 02:15:56,905
- And so?
- Gibraltar!

697
02:15:57,073 --> 02:16:01,535
Use your brain, you idiot!
That strait ...

698
02:16:04,873 --> 02:16:12,171
It's like the eye of a needle.
We'll never slip through there.

699
02:16:28,146 --> 02:16:35,486
The Mediterranean. It's madness.
It's swarming with combat ships.

700
02:16:35,653 --> 02:16:43,118
Stand by ...
Zero. 25 degrees, 43.3 minutes.

701
02:16:45,205 --> 02:16:50,709
Gibraltar. It's the best chance
to get ourselves killed.

702
02:17:05,183 --> 02:17:10,479
When we reach Vigo,
you go ashore with the chief.

703
02:17:10,647 --> 02:17:16,026
- But, sir ...
- I've already made the decision.

704
02:17:18,780 --> 02:17:24,284
I've got to find
a replacement for the chief.

705
02:17:25,370 --> 02:17:30,249
Our agents will smuggle you
out of Spain somehow.

706
02:17:30,417 --> 02:17:34,211
Dressed up as gypsies, for instance.

707
02:17:34,379 --> 02:17:40,259
- I thought I would be going ...
- No arguments.

708
02:17:40,427 --> 02:17:46,598
It's all settled.
It's easier to get two of you out.

709
02:17:49,686 --> 02:17:54,106
I really believe
the chief needs a break.

710
02:18:05,785 --> 02:18:09,121
His wife is very ill.

711
02:18:11,624 --> 02:18:15,044
He must get home.

712
02:18:19,090 --> 02:18:22,718
I understand, sir.

713
02:18:36,608 --> 02:18:40,110
Tough break.

714
02:18:50,789 --> 02:18:57,294
When we reach Vigo, it's goodbye.
The captain's ordered me ashore.

715
02:18:58,963 --> 02:19:03,175
The chief leaves, too.

716
02:19:05,595 --> 02:19:10,891
I ... could deliver
your mail for you.

717
02:19:18,900 --> 02:19:22,027
Yeah.

718
02:19:28,326 --> 02:19:32,037
There's quite a bunch of them here.

719
02:19:34,916 --> 02:19:38,836
Well, it's quite a romance,
isn't it?

720
02:20:19,002 --> 02:20:22,129
Equalize.

721
02:20:31,765 --> 02:20:36,643
- Help me out with the gear.
- Quiet, men!

722
02:20:36,811 --> 02:20:43,734
All ahead one-third.
Left 10 degrees rudder.

723
02:20:43,902 --> 02:20:49,156
Now we just have to find
this little barge.

724
02:20:49,324 --> 02:20:52,993
"SS Weser."

725
02:20:53,161 --> 02:20:57,456
A German merchant ship.
She's got herself interned here.

726
02:20:57,624 --> 02:21:04,880
- With torpedoes, fuel and supplies.
- All for us, Kriechbaum.

727
02:21:05,048 --> 02:21:08,467
First-class service.

728
02:21:20,814 --> 02:21:24,483
Starboard engines stop.

729
02:21:25,402 --> 02:21:30,406
- We arrived.
- Port engines stop.

730
02:21:38,081 --> 02:21:41,834
Officers to bridge.

731
02:21:55,598 --> 02:21:58,726
Gentlemen ...

732
02:22:03,440 --> 02:22:06,483
Three cheers
for our galant U-boat men.

733
02:22:19,372 --> 02:22:25,127
- You are most welcome, Captain.
- No, no ...

734
02:22:26,421 --> 02:22:32,968
- This is our commander.
- My apologies, sir.

735
02:22:34,721 --> 02:22:39,683
A pleasure to have you aboard
the "Weser", Captain.

736
02:22:39,851 --> 02:22:45,105
A hero.
I'm delighted to be so honoured.

737
02:22:45,273 --> 02:22:51,570
Gentlemen, here they stand,
our heroes of the deep.

738
02:22:52,280 --> 02:23:00,579
The grey wolves.
Our humble ship is honoured.

739
02:23:00,747 --> 02:23:03,999
Captain, lead the way.

740
02:23:04,167 --> 02:23:08,671
- Welcome on board.
- What a nice clean tugboat.

741
02:23:09,673 --> 02:23:17,262
We've done what we can for you.
I hope it's to your taste.

742
02:23:17,430 --> 02:23:21,392
Quite a table. Just like home.

743
02:23:21,559 --> 02:23:28,941
Fresh bread. Cakes. Fruit.
Sausage, our chef's specialty.

744
02:23:29,109 --> 02:23:33,904
We're waiting to hear your news.

745
02:23:34,072 --> 02:23:38,033
You can't imagine
what it means to us.

746
02:23:38,201 --> 02:23:41,704
It isn't easy here.
It's very frustrating.

747
02:23:41,871 --> 02:23:45,416
Sure, there's plenty to eat.
Fuel is no problem.

748
02:23:45,583 --> 02:23:53,048
Torpedoes are very tricky though ...
but you're all set up.

749
02:23:53,216 --> 02:24:00,431
The Spaniards tolerate us, but
that's about all. Christmas cake.

750
02:24:02,559 --> 02:24:09,314
How many ship have you sunk?
I guess about ...

751
02:24:09,482 --> 02:24:14,236
Oh, champagne. Take a glass.

752
02:24:14,779 --> 02:24:21,410
Gentlemen, raise your glasses.
Drink to our heroes.

753
02:24:21,578 --> 02:24:29,209
To the German U-boat service
and out beloved Fuhrer ...

754
02:24:30,754 --> 02:24:35,466
We're not exactly at home ...
if you understand what I mean.

755
02:24:35,633 --> 02:24:37,968
All the best.

756
02:24:42,682 --> 02:24:49,897
- There's plenty for everyone.
- Let's get down to business.

757
02:24:53,735 --> 02:25:00,407
Tell us all about it, Captain.
I'm bursting with curiosity.

758
02:25:00,575 --> 02:25:03,994
Those are fresh figs.

759
02:25:05,955 --> 02:25:09,041
Fresh figs!

760
02:25:10,794 --> 02:25:15,005
I've never had one.

761
02:25:18,343 --> 02:25:22,513
Yeah ...

762
02:25:25,934 --> 02:25:31,146
This time we very nearly had it.

763
02:25:33,817 --> 02:25:40,364
Phenomenal. You see, gentlemen,
that's the stuff heroes are made of.

764
02:25:40,532 --> 02:25:45,661
Phenomenal, that's what it is.
I want to hear more, Captain.

765
02:25:45,829 --> 02:25:53,585
Give me your plate. Herring salad.
The chef's mother's own recipe.

766
02:25:55,088 --> 02:25:59,883
Just taste that. There's lots more.

767
02:26:00,051 --> 02:26:07,599
So ...
what's it like to be under water -

768
02:26:07,767 --> 02:26:11,145
- while overhead
the enemy lies in wait?

769
02:26:11,312 --> 02:26:15,774
- It's dark.
- Dark?

770
02:26:15,942 --> 02:26:22,114
- Yes, and very quiet.
- Just as long as no one belches.

771
02:26:22,282 --> 02:26:27,911
- Why is that?
- I can explain what he means.

772
02:26:28,079 --> 02:26:31,457
We're often running at silent speed.

773
02:26:31,624 --> 02:26:37,254
- And that's why you can't belch!
- The men from Madrid are here.

774
02:26:37,422 --> 02:26:40,883
Seewald, we've been expecting you.
Captain, over here.

775
02:26:44,220 --> 02:26:49,099
The representative
of our naval attache here.

776
02:26:49,267 --> 02:26:52,770
I have some
communications from Berlin.

777
02:26:53,855 --> 02:26:57,733
First the documents
for the breakthrough.

778
02:26:58,735 --> 02:27:03,030
Then ... this cable came.

779
02:27:14,084 --> 02:27:17,211
Chief, Lt. Werner.

780
02:27:20,799 --> 02:27:24,343
We are going for a little fresh air.

781
02:27:32,143 --> 02:27:36,563
- What's happening, Seewald?
- Bad news.

782
02:27:42,195 --> 02:27:47,658
Headquarters say no.
Our request has been denied, Chief.

783
02:27:50,829 --> 02:27:57,209
There's no replacement.
You'll stay too, Werner.

784
02:28:02,298 --> 02:28:05,426
I'm sorry.

785
02:28:07,762 --> 02:28:11,265
I guess it's just as well.

786
02:28:13,184 --> 02:28:18,397
Who knows what kind of idiot
they'd have sent you.

787
02:28:19,858 --> 02:28:24,028
One of those new found warriors
who's all wind and smoke.

788
02:28:29,743 --> 02:28:32,911
You could be right.

789
02:28:33,079 --> 02:28:36,749
They could have sent us
some senoritas.

790
02:28:36,916 --> 02:28:43,672
It's a good thing they didn't.
Spanish crabs. That's all we'd need.

791
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:49,428
Get that chart table cleared.
I can't navigate on bananas.

792
02:28:49,596 --> 02:28:55,267
What do you think you're doing?
Get that fruit out of here.

793
02:28:57,312 --> 02:29:03,525
- Is that a Christmas tree?
- No, camouflage for the bridge.

794
02:29:05,653 --> 02:29:09,406
We're staying.
They won't replace us.

795
02:29:21,044 --> 02:29:24,254
I'm sorry, Ullman.

796
02:29:40,397 --> 02:29:46,276
7 miles from coast to coast.
A bit narrow.

797
02:29:48,363 --> 02:29:55,202
These are the only British dockyards
in the western Mediterranen.

798
02:29:57,205 --> 02:30:00,708
They are very heavily defended.

799
02:30:03,670 --> 02:30:08,173
The place will be crawling
with patrol boats.

800
02:30:08,341 --> 02:30:13,262
Anything that floats
will be on the water.

801
02:30:15,890 --> 02:30:21,520
This is where we have to go.
That's the situation.

802
02:30:34,200 --> 02:30:40,247
We move in under darkness.
On the surface.

803
02:30:44,085 --> 02:30:47,713
We'll see if we can slip through.

804
02:30:51,676 --> 02:30:55,512
As near to Gibraltar as we can get.

805
02:31:04,898 --> 02:31:10,819
Then dive down
and let ourselves drift through.

806
02:31:15,909 --> 02:31:19,370
And so ...

807
02:31:21,289 --> 02:31:28,712
... dive and let the surface current
pull us through the Strait.

808
02:31:30,006 --> 02:31:34,009
It's an easy trick.

809
02:31:34,636 --> 02:31:40,891
Quiet as a shadow
and we burn less fuel.

810
02:31:49,818 --> 02:31:53,570
Well, Kriechbaum?

811
02:31:58,118 --> 02:32:01,912
Clever trick, Captain.

812
02:32:25,812 --> 02:32:29,273
Right, let's get going.

813
02:32:33,445 --> 02:32:37,197
All ahead two-thirds.

814
02:32:39,909 --> 02:32:44,538
The navigator and I stay up here.
Now clear the bridge.

815
02:33:01,056 --> 02:33:07,478
- Come right to 079.
- Course: 079.

816
02:33:16,154 --> 02:33:19,448
Half the British fleet is out there.

817
02:33:20,658 --> 02:33:27,206
Come left 20 degrees.
Change to main motors.

818
02:33:28,041 --> 02:33:34,046
It's very kind of the enemy
to show their navigation lights.

819
02:33:37,050 --> 02:33:42,096
Come left another 10.
Steer 050.

820
02:33:42,263 --> 02:33:45,015
Course: 050.

821
02:34:00,073 --> 02:34:05,035
Destroyer on port bow.
Range: 800.

822
02:34:05,203 --> 02:34:08,455
Going which way?
Is she closing?

823
02:34:15,505 --> 02:34:19,299
- No, she's heading away.
- That's good.

824
02:34:22,470 --> 02:34:26,306
Left full rudder. All ahead full.

825
02:34:26,474 --> 02:34:30,644
Rudder is left full.
All engines indicate ahead full.

826
02:34:32,897 --> 02:34:35,649
Steady as you go.

827
02:34:52,334 --> 02:34:59,256
- Come right. Course: 079.
- Course: 079.

828
02:34:59,424 --> 02:35:05,888
- All ahead two-thirds.
- Engines indicate ahead two-thirds.

829
02:35:27,911 --> 02:35:31,205
Right full rudder. Quick!

830
02:35:31,373 --> 02:35:34,541
- Right full rudder.
- Damn!

831
02:35:47,389 --> 02:35:50,849
Kriechbaum ...

832
02:35:52,686 --> 02:35:55,688
Gibraltar.

833
02:36:17,252 --> 02:36:19,628
We'll dive in 10 minutes.

834
02:36:35,020 --> 02:36:38,063
Alarm!

835
02:36:42,819 --> 02:36:47,990
- Alarm!
- Don't dive! The captain's up top!

836
02:36:49,784 --> 02:36:55,748
Navigator wounded.
Start flooding!

837
02:36:55,915 --> 02:36:59,877
Stand by escape gear.
Ready to abandon ship!

838
02:37:00,503 --> 02:37:07,384
- Where's the escape gear?
- Calm down!

839
02:37:07,552 --> 02:37:10,262
Bring the medic!

840
02:37:10,430 --> 02:37:16,935
Both engines maximum power.
Hard starboard.

841
02:37:17,103 --> 02:37:23,609
Easy. Here, take this.
Okay, we'll fix you up.

842
02:37:28,198 --> 02:37:33,369
Faster! Faster!

843
02:37:41,836 --> 02:37:44,254
Compresses!

844
02:37:50,053 --> 02:37:55,849
- Out of the way!
- Silence on board!

845
02:37:56,017 --> 02:38:01,188
- The port engine belt is loose.
- Maintain full power, Chief!

846
02:38:01,356 --> 02:38:04,942
All the power you've got!

847
02:38:05,110 --> 02:38:11,115
- Where the hell's he going?
- Due south. The African coastline.

848
02:38:19,582 --> 02:38:22,292
Damn it!

849
02:38:24,546 --> 02:38:30,551
- Alarm!
- Ready to dive! All hands forward!

850
02:38:36,307 --> 02:38:42,354
- Move! Clear the way!
- 90 metres. Quick!

851
02:38:42,522 --> 02:38:46,942
Bow planes zero.
Stern planes up 5. Shut vents.

852
02:38:47,110 --> 02:38:52,239
- Bow planes out of action!
- Switch to manual.

853
02:38:52,407 --> 02:38:56,118
The bow plane has jammed on dive.

854
02:39:01,416 --> 02:39:05,753
Damn it! All engines stop.

855
02:39:05,920 --> 02:39:12,259
- All men go aft!
- Hurry!

856
02:39:14,846 --> 02:39:20,934
- Move! Pump everything aft.
- Auxiliary pump out of action.

857
02:39:21,102 --> 02:39:25,981
- Blow forward tanks!
- Forward tanks blown.

858
02:39:26,149 --> 02:39:33,947
- She's still going down.
- We've got to shed some weight.

859
02:39:35,784 --> 02:39:39,953
Keep him quiet!

860
02:39:40,121 --> 02:39:46,293
- Main pump out of action!
- Permission to blow?

861
02:39:46,461 --> 02:39:49,755
Hard astern full.

862
02:39:52,717 --> 02:39:58,055
- No effect.
- All right, blow.

863
02:39:58,223 --> 02:40:00,849
Blow forward ballast.

864
02:40:03,144 --> 02:40:05,521
Pull out!

865
02:40:07,941 --> 02:40:11,860
Damn you! Pull out!

866
02:40:12,028 --> 02:40:17,199
- All you've got, Chief!
- Blow all we've got.

867
02:40:21,788 --> 02:40:23,956
Pull up.

868
02:40:28,086 --> 02:40:31,296
Christ, please ...

869
02:40:45,520 --> 02:40:49,023
We can't hold her.

870
02:40:53,778 --> 02:40:56,780
200.

871
02:40:59,743 --> 02:41:02,453
210.

872
02:41:05,290 --> 02:41:08,167
220 metres.

873
02:41:09,044 --> 02:41:13,547
230. 240.

874
02:41:24,267 --> 02:41:30,189
- My God!
- Lord, turn not away from me.

875
02:41:30,357 --> 02:41:32,816
Take away all our sins.

876
02:42:23,493 --> 02:42:26,787
A shovel full of sand.

877
02:42:28,415 --> 02:42:33,544
The gods left a shovel full of sand
to keep us up.

878
02:42:43,805 --> 02:42:50,269
280 metres
and she's still in one piece!

879
02:43:38,026 --> 02:43:42,529
Torpedo hatch taking water!

880
02:43:43,239 --> 02:43:49,578
- Torpedo hatch taking water!
- Motor room taking water.

881
02:43:54,417 --> 02:43:58,462
We're taking water!

882
02:44:00,131 --> 02:44:04,677
- What do you need?
- Some timber for sawing.

883
02:44:06,638 --> 02:44:12,601
- Exhaust valve okay?
- I need the saw.

884
02:44:12,769 --> 02:44:16,397
Give me that flashlight.

885
02:44:17,357 --> 02:44:23,487
- I need a wrench.
- Water coming in!

886
02:44:23,655 --> 02:44:27,574
Where are the tools?

887
02:44:27,742 --> 02:44:34,873
- Bring me the tools.
- Where are you going?

888
02:44:35,041 --> 02:44:40,379
- Switchboard out of action.
- Give me proper damage reports!

889
02:44:40,547 --> 02:44:46,635
- We can't stop the flooding.
- With so much damage, we've had it.

890
02:44:46,803 --> 02:44:52,099
- Where's the most damage?
- Below, sir.

891
02:44:52,267 --> 02:44:56,854
Check the damage
to the batteries. Quickly!

892
02:44:58,940 --> 02:45:03,444
- Tighten that bolt.
- I can't see.

893
02:45:03,611 --> 02:45:07,823
Push as hard as you can.
It's stuck tight.

894
02:45:07,991 --> 02:45:11,035
I can't wedge it.

895
02:45:11,202 --> 02:45:15,873
- Give me the hammer.
- Take the wrench!

896
02:45:20,170 --> 02:45:25,758
- Do you need more men aft?
- I'll ask the lieutenant.

897
02:45:25,925 --> 02:45:29,887
This damn thing! Hold my light!

898
02:45:32,599 --> 02:45:39,313
You stupid son of a pig!
We've got work to do!

899
02:45:39,481 --> 02:45:46,445
- Tools from the engine room.
- Where's that damn wrench?

900
02:45:49,783 --> 02:45:54,953
- Bring another wrench.
- Hold the light.

901
02:45:55,789 --> 02:46:03,253
The bearings have seized.
It just keeps rising!

902
02:46:03,421 --> 02:46:06,924
Tighten the seals.
Don't shear the bolts.

903
02:46:07,801 --> 02:46:14,848
- The cooling system is leaking.
- Tighten the seals down there.

904
02:46:18,186 --> 02:46:25,693
Give me that shoring.
Take it, quickly!

905
02:46:25,860 --> 02:46:31,490
It's flooded down here.
Get me the biggest one.

906
02:46:31,658 --> 02:46:35,160
That's the biggest we can find.

907
02:46:35,829 --> 02:46:38,497
Higher!

908
02:46:40,792 --> 02:46:44,294
- Where do we put him?
- Easy, men.

909
02:46:44,462 --> 02:46:49,133
Captain,
the chief's looking for you.

910
02:46:54,931 --> 02:47:00,269
We're taking water fast.
The cooling sytem is blocked.

911
02:47:00,437 --> 02:47:06,400
The compressors are dislodged.

912
02:47:06,568 --> 02:47:10,654
Damn! What about fuel leaks?

913
02:47:10,822 --> 02:47:17,244
I can't tell as yet. Many of
the battery cells are cracked.

914
02:47:17,412 --> 02:47:20,330
Chlorine gas.

915
02:47:22,792 --> 02:47:26,253
It's red. Acid in the bilge.

916
02:47:26,421 --> 02:47:31,258
See how many cells have cracked.
Get some battery straps.

917
02:47:31,426 --> 02:47:35,679
- Battery straps!
- Get that out of the way.

918
02:47:35,847 --> 02:47:42,144
The chief needs battery straps,
make it quick!

919
02:47:48,777 --> 02:47:53,906
- It's still coming in.
- Get me the hammer.

920
02:47:58,203 --> 02:48:01,955
- Here!
- Thanks, Lieutenant.

921
02:48:04,834 --> 02:48:09,630
Get it in!

922
02:48:11,257 --> 02:48:16,261
- Watch out. Coming through.
- Quiet.

923
02:48:16,429 --> 02:48:19,306
Easy.

924
02:48:24,062 --> 02:48:29,983
Tell the chief the water is up to
the torpedo hatch and rising.

925
02:48:36,950 --> 02:48:39,326
I need light.

926
02:48:39,494 --> 02:48:45,374
Who's working on those shaft seals.
Tell them to hurry up.

927
02:48:47,252 --> 02:48:54,008
- 24 battery cells cracked.
- What a hell of a mess.

928
02:48:54,175 --> 02:48:59,888
- Battery straps.
- Come here with those.

929
02:49:01,933 --> 02:49:05,853
Let's hope these are enough.

930
02:49:07,981 --> 02:49:13,944
Our only chance
is to bridge all the live cells.

931
02:49:16,614 --> 02:49:21,785
- It's no good. I can't see.
- More light.

932
02:49:22,370 --> 02:49:28,167
We've got to close the leaks
or it's all over for us.

933
02:49:34,257 --> 02:49:37,551
More to the right.

934
02:49:44,684 --> 02:49:50,939
- I need wire to bridge them.
- Wire for the battery cells.

935
02:49:59,699 --> 02:50:04,953
The chief needs wire.
Get moving. Did you hear me?

936
02:50:05,121 --> 02:50:11,293
We've got plenty of fancy torpedoes.
Each one is 25,000 marks.

937
02:50:11,461 --> 02:50:17,716
All they forget
is 50 pfennigs' worth of old wire!

938
02:50:17,884 --> 02:50:23,931
- Now what?
- The draining pump is jammed.

939
02:50:24,099 --> 02:50:27,851
- That's great.
- Captain.

940
02:50:28,019 --> 02:50:33,148
- Here.
- Better than nothing.

941
02:50:33,316 --> 02:50:36,151
Pliers!

942
02:50:38,655 --> 02:50:41,782
Captain ...

943
02:50:46,996 --> 02:50:51,041
All the leaks have been stopped.

944
02:50:54,379 --> 02:50:57,047
Good, Johann.

945
02:50:59,884 --> 02:51:03,429
That's good.

946
02:51:06,808 --> 02:51:10,185
Now change your wet things, man.

947
02:51:20,113 --> 02:51:25,993
We must get rid of the water.
There just has to be a way.

948
02:51:26,161 --> 02:51:30,539
Into the control-room bilge
and then outside.

949
02:51:34,419 --> 02:51:40,549
- Give it to me.
- Careful, you jerk!

950
02:51:40,717 --> 02:51:45,596
- Hoist the bucket.
- Get a move on, boys.

951
02:51:49,184 --> 02:51:52,519
Keep the rhythm going.

952
02:51:53,104 --> 02:51:57,816
Put your backs into it.

953
02:51:57,984 --> 02:52:01,904
Step on it. Quick!

954
02:52:06,493 --> 02:52:12,581
- How's it going, Chief?
- Three more. Starboard side.

955
02:52:22,801 --> 02:52:28,263
- How does it look?
- Only three to go, sir.

956
02:52:40,443 --> 02:52:43,987
Make some room for the chief.

957
02:52:59,713 --> 02:53:05,968
- More hands needed aft.
- Take the men off watch.

958
02:53:06,594 --> 02:53:12,683
Captain ... all of our compasses
are out of action.

959
02:53:14,602 --> 02:53:19,565
We've lost the sounding gear.
All radio contact is dead.

960
02:53:22,193 --> 02:53:28,449
- First-rate condition.
- Can we get up again?

961
02:53:34,039 --> 02:53:37,916
Do you think we have a chance, sir?

962
02:53:42,756 --> 02:53:46,258
Good question.

963
02:53:50,513 --> 02:53:56,810
A bit of air must still be in
the ballast tanks from the blowing.

964
02:53:58,980 --> 02:54:06,737
That should help us. We'll use all
the high-pressure air we have left.

965
02:54:09,115 --> 02:54:12,785
We'll try.

966
02:54:14,954 --> 02:54:23,212
The boat has to be lighter.
We've got to get the water out.

967
02:54:28,176 --> 02:54:31,929
It must work!

968
02:54:32,639 --> 02:54:36,266
Come with me aft.

969
02:54:42,482 --> 02:54:50,072
The ballast pump and the compressed
air could just force the water out.

970
02:54:50,240 --> 02:54:55,953
- The ballast pump?
- We're fixing it.

971
02:54:58,206 --> 02:55:05,004
We gamble on one count.
One blast and we ...

972
02:55:05,171 --> 02:55:10,718
- There won't be a second chance.
- When?

973
02:55:10,885 --> 02:55:16,390
When the repairs are completed.
ln about eight hours, sir.

974
02:55:16,558 --> 02:55:20,936
- CO2 content?
- 1 .8%.

975
02:55:21,104 --> 02:55:25,649
- Will the oxygen last?
- No.

976
02:55:27,819 --> 02:55:34,908
Emergency issue.
All men not working turn in.

977
02:56:44,771 --> 02:56:50,317
- Will he pull through?
- It's difficult to say.

978
02:57:07,043 --> 02:57:10,838
He doesn't look too good.

979
02:57:48,752 --> 02:57:53,005
Well, Pilgrim ...
is everything okay?

980
02:57:53,173 --> 02:57:57,426
We're getting it under control.
I think we're winning.

981
02:58:01,014 --> 02:58:07,061
- How is it looking aft?
- We've done what we can, sir.

982
02:58:08,313 --> 02:58:12,024
I guess it's time
I looked things over.

983
02:58:44,391 --> 02:58:47,559
You should be careful.

984
02:59:09,124 --> 02:59:13,794
- Can you make it?
- We'll make it.

985
02:59:15,338 --> 02:59:22,136
- How does it look?
- We'll soon be running.

986
02:59:30,061 --> 02:59:37,151
- How's it going?
- Two bearings to be changed.

987
03:00:32,248 --> 03:00:36,210
Chief ...

988
03:00:42,509 --> 03:00:46,637
Do you want some glucose?

989
03:00:48,598 --> 03:00:51,809
How about some apple juice?

990
03:01:25,385 --> 03:01:31,306
They were crazy,
ordering us through the strait.

991
03:01:31,474 --> 03:01:34,977
It was going to go wrong ...

992
03:01:39,357 --> 03:01:42,901
He knew it.

993
03:01:43,069 --> 03:01:46,613
The old man, he knew it.

994
03:01:50,702 --> 03:01:57,916
From the moment that radio signal
came through, he realized the risk.

995
03:02:00,754 --> 03:02:07,092
That's the reason
he ordered us ashore.

996
03:02:11,431 --> 03:02:15,184
He knew there was very little hope.

997
03:02:30,450 --> 03:02:37,373
He tried to fool us.
"An easy trick," he said.

998
03:02:41,044 --> 03:02:45,422
"Dive and drift with the current."

999
03:02:49,636 --> 03:02:54,014
What a clever trick.

1000
03:02:54,641 --> 03:02:58,936
But it has to work.

1001
03:03:04,317 --> 03:03:07,986
Will we ever get out of this?

1002
03:03:16,788 --> 03:03:20,416
I really don't know.

1003
03:04:08,381 --> 03:04:14,803
- I'm sorry.
- You think it's hopeless now?

1004
03:04:17,891 --> 03:04:21,852
It's been 1 5 hours.

1005
03:04:28,693 --> 03:04:32,363
We'll never do it.

1006
03:04:53,176 --> 03:04:55,511
I'm sorry.

1007
03:05:03,687 --> 03:05:08,023
They made us all dream
for this day.

1008
03:05:12,153 --> 03:05:16,490
To be fearless and proud and alone.

1009
03:05:17,409 --> 03:05:23,247
They told us it would be
the test of our manhood.

1010
03:05:23,415 --> 03:05:31,714
To need no one and sacrific all
for the fatherland and courage.

1011
03:05:35,385 --> 03:05:39,138
Is that not the way
they said it all?

1012
03:05:42,100 --> 03:05:48,188
I just want someone to be with.

1013
03:05:53,445 --> 03:05:57,823
The only thing I feel is afraid.

1014
03:06:47,248 --> 03:06:50,709
Situation report, sir.

1015
03:06:54,547 --> 03:06:59,343
The boat is in order.
The pump is clear.

1016
03:07:00,720 --> 03:07:07,893
Water in the trimming tanks can
be blown out with compressed air.

1017
03:07:08,895 --> 03:07:14,525
The compass is in order.
Echo sounder clear.

1018
03:07:15,276 --> 03:07:19,405
Maybe we'll be okay.

1019
03:07:29,874 --> 03:07:33,711
Good, Chief.

1020
03:07:36,381 --> 03:07:39,341
Good.

1021
03:07:47,600 --> 03:07:50,811
Go and take a rest now.

1022
03:07:57,485 --> 03:08:01,155
Just a few small problems left, sir.

1023
03:08:46,701 --> 03:08:55,000
You have to have good men.
Good men, all of them.

1024
03:08:59,047 --> 03:09:01,965
Now listen ...

1025
03:09:02,133 --> 03:09:09,431
We're going to blow out the water
and try to get out of the sand.

1026
03:09:11,726 --> 03:09:18,816
If we make it to the surface,
it could still get pretty rough.

1027
03:09:19,943 --> 03:09:23,487
The traffic's heavy up there.

1028
03:09:27,117 --> 03:09:33,163
Pray the engines start
so we can get out of this mess.

1029
03:09:34,082 --> 03:09:41,547
With the condition the boat is in
we'll head straight for La Rochelle.

1030
03:09:43,717 --> 03:09:48,721
If we make it,
it's half a bottle of beer for each.

1031
03:09:53,101 --> 03:09:57,229
There's one thing on our side ...

1032
03:09:58,398 --> 03:10:02,109
They won't be expecting us.

1033
03:10:08,158 --> 03:10:11,285
Well, men ...

1034
03:10:12,245 --> 03:10:16,582
- All set?
- Aye-aye, sir.

1035
03:10:19,002 --> 03:10:23,005
- Surface contacts?
- Nothing near, Captain.

1036
03:10:23,173 --> 03:10:28,802
Get ready to surface.
Stand by escape gear. Red light on.

1037
03:10:29,721 --> 03:10:32,890
Battle stations.

1038
03:10:56,581 --> 03:11:00,668
- Let her blow.
- Blow all tanks.

1039
03:12:13,700 --> 03:12:16,618
She's rising.

1040
03:12:17,537 --> 03:12:21,790
- Easy.
- Starboard planes down 1 5.

1041
03:12:30,425 --> 03:12:36,764
- 270 metres!
- First watch, stand by.

1042
03:12:36,931 --> 03:12:39,767
260 metres.

1043
03:12:45,398 --> 03:12:48,484
250 metres.

1044
03:12:56,117 --> 03:12:59,119
240 metres.

1045
03:13:03,958 --> 03:13:07,002
230 metres.

1046
03:13:11,591 --> 03:13:14,385
220.

1047
03:14:09,274 --> 03:14:11,775
Start up engines?

1048
03:14:16,239 --> 03:14:21,702
- Go ahead. Both main engines.
- This is it, boys.

1049
03:14:30,420 --> 03:14:33,839
Yeah.

1050
03:14:47,937 --> 03:14:50,814
They're going!

1051
03:14:50,982 --> 03:14:55,861
I've never heard such sweet music
in all my life.

1052
03:14:58,573 --> 03:15:01,700
They're running!

1053
03:15:16,091 --> 03:15:19,885
They won't catch us this time.
Not this time!

1054
03:15:23,390 --> 03:15:28,727
Keep going and get us back.
That's an order!

1055
03:15:28,895 --> 03:15:32,690
Right full rudder.
Come to 320.

1056
03:15:32,857 --> 03:15:35,734
Jesus that's good!

1057
03:15:40,073 --> 03:15:46,203
They haven't spotted us.
They're snoring in their bunks.

1058
03:15:49,749 --> 03:15:55,546
They're drinking in the bar.
Celebrating our sinking!

1059
03:15:58,341 --> 03:16:02,177
Not yet, my friends!

1060
03:16:41,551 --> 03:16:46,930
- Boys, here's to home!
- And an end to the war.

1061
03:17:21,800 --> 03:17:25,344
Let's pray the engines hold out.

1062
03:17:27,722 --> 03:17:32,685
With a bit of luck ...

1063
03:17:35,230 --> 03:17:38,982
... we'll make it back home.

1064
03:17:42,862 --> 03:17:49,451
Third U-boat flotilla
welcome back home. Three cheers.

1065
03:18:20,400 --> 03:18:23,861
Both engines stop.
Stern line out.

1066
03:18:49,804 --> 03:18:56,435
- Thank you, Hinrich.
- It's okay. The sun is shining.

1067
03:18:57,437 --> 03:19:01,106
Another two metres.

1068
03:19:02,442 --> 03:19:05,527
Okay, we have it.

1069
03:19:12,118 --> 03:19:16,121
- Nearly there.
- Wounded man coming ashore.

1070
03:20:44,753 --> 03:20:47,838
Get under cover!

1071
03:21:21,664 --> 03:21:27,002
- Bring a medic!
- Over here.

1072
03:21:27,170 --> 03:21:30,964
Medic!
