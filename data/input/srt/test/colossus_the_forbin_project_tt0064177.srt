00:04:31,263 --> 00:04:34,598
Look here,
please.

3
00:04:58,024 --> 00:05:00,548
Mr. President.
All systems are activated.

4
00:05:00,678 --> 00:05:02,651
I hope
I've not kept waiting.

5
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,978
Congratulations, Dr. Forbin,
for your great work.

6
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:08,852
A car awaits us.

7
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,663
This stuff will put us in retirement,
but ... Congratulations, Dr. Forbin!

8
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,093
That will not happen.

9
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:19,446
Listen, he's the most relieved!

10
00:05:20,547 --> 00:05:23,720
The Secretary of Defense
Secretary of State and myself,

11
00:05:24,188 --> 00:05:28,162
have discussed how
to announce the news:

12
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,671
we are all agreed,
it will be simple and direct.

13
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:37,166
We will disclose
the greatest secret of history.

14
00:05:37,717 --> 00:05:39,950
It only remains
to warn everyone.

00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:15,178
<i> We can not accept it. </ i>

21
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,601
<i> For years,
the U.S. has worked on this problem. </ i>

22
00:06:19,073 --> 00:06:21,843
<i> For years,
this was our best kept secret, </ i>

29
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,217
<i> A system called "Colossus". </ i>

30
00:06:48,434 --> 00:06:50,899
The most advanced ever built,

31
00:06:51,862 --> 00:06:54,422
able to study the information,

32
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:59,339
and, based on facts alone,
from deciding to launch an attack.

33
00:07:00,513 --> 00:07:02,477
If it detects an imminent
assault,

34
00:07:02,568 --> 00:07:06,161
Colossus will react immediately,
taking control of nuclear weapons.

35
00:07:06,455 --> 00:07:09,633
It can select and execute
what seems most appropriate.

36
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:14,158
Its decisions are superior
those that could take a human.

37
00:07:14,773 --> 00:07:17,119
His knowledge and analytical skills

38
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:20,012
surpass those of the greatest geniuses.

39
00:07:21,652 --> 00:07:24,127
And, most important of all:
he has no emotions,

40
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:26,972
neither fear nor hatred nor desires.

41
00:07:27,758 --> 00:07:30,075
He can not act
under the influence of feelings.

42
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:32,839
It does nothing
if there is no threat.

43
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:36,437
Here Dr. Charles Forbin,

44
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:38,913
the largest
world expert in computers

45
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,872
and somehow,
the father of Colossus.

46
00:07:44,446 --> 00:07:45,982
Thank you, Mr. President.

47
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:50,159
Ladies and gentlemen, I will be brief.

The main memory and Calculators

54
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:21,580
includes all modes
of transmittal,

55
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:26,042
microwave, laser, TV networks,

56
00:08:26,744 --> 00:08:28,818
data transmission, satellite,

57
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:30,671
worldwide.

58
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,963
The whole system

59
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,493
is protected by powerful fields
electromagnetic

60
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:38,498
and other means of cons-measures.

61
00:08:39,896 --> 00:08:42,590
Colossus works
without human intervention.

62
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:46,249
Its location is not secret,

63
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:49,822
nor do its functions.

64
00:08:50,642 --> 00:08:54,361
He is totally vulnerable to attack,
Front or indirect,

65
00:08:54,405 --> 00:08:58,271
and if one of them succeeded,
we would be defenseless.

66
00:08:58,717 --> 00:09:00,011
<i> However, </ i>

67
00:09:00,948 --> 00:09:03,360
<i> Colossus has its own defenses. </ i>

68
00:09:04,596 --> 00:09:06,318
<i> It is its own defense. </ i>

69
00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:08,316

70
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:12,071
<i> against its sources of information
or power, </ i>

71
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:15,120
<i> Colossus branch
on its uninterruptible power supply </ i>

72
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,329
<i> which provides for all its needs. </ i>

73
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,924
It is self-sufficient,

74
00:09:20,482 --> 00:09:23,299
protects itself alone, eats alone,

75
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:26,292
he is invulnerable.

76
00:09:27,195 --> 00:09:28,713
Clearly,

77
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:30,865
there is no way,

78
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:33,098
for any human
to attack him.

79
00:09:34,653 --> 00:09:36,172
Before us,

80
00:09:38,023 --> 00:09:43,746
this is one of many terminals
connected to the computer center.

81
00:09:46,334 --> 00:09:49,977
With this, Colossus
can contact us,

82
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:57,451
and with this machine,
we can communicate with him.

83
00:09:59,784 --> 00:10:01,755
One last thing.

84
00:10:02,637 --> 00:10:04,491
An inevitable question,

85
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:07,645
I have often been asked.

86
00:10:12,134 --> 00:10:15,163
Colossus can he think?

87
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,918
Is it rational person?

88
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:24,081
The answer is "No".

89
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:28,071
<i> However, Colossus
is a paragon of knowledge. </ i>

90
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:30,912
<i> Knowledge
that can grow without limit. </ i>

91
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,405
<i> I hope, as scientists </ i>

<i> who helped me with this project, </ i>

93
00:10:39,832 --> 00:10:42,945
that the power of this computer
will not only

94
00:10:43,544 --> 00:10:45,359
the defense of this country,

95
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:50,041
but also to solve
global issues

96
00:10:50,601 --> 00:10:52,836
and those that will confront us

97
00:10:53,513 --> 00:10:56,125
when we enter
the mysteries of the universe.

98
00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:02,651
Thank you, Dr. Forbin.

99
00:11:06,183 --> 00:11:09,265
<i> And so, fellow humans, </ i>

100
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:15,517
<i> we now live in the shelter,
and not in the shadow of Colossus. </ i>

Harry Truman said, there has for years

it failed on his desk.

This is no longer true, now!

141

Colossus will now assume
this charge.

00:15:54,602 --> 00:15:56,603
Dr. Markham, and all others

163
00:15:57,617 --> 00:16:00,785
check the program
control administrator.

164
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:06,036
Mr. President, Ambassador
Soviet insists you speak.

165
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,388
Why this call,
Ambassador?

166
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:14,248
- Give me the CPO.
- Yes, we are very proud.

167
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:20,434
- Repeat, please.
- Jeff, test the hardware.

168
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:24,008
Thank you for the accused.

169
00:16:24,743 --> 00:16:27,521
No, no comment.
Good night, Mr. Ambassador.

170
00:16:29,603 --> 00:16:32,250
Dr. Fisher,
run the test program.

171
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,993
Call Grauber.
I want to know what the damn CIA.

172
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:44,264
The Council of the USSR announced
tomorrow 23 am Moscow time,

173
00:16:45,156 --> 00:16:49,331
the activation of an electronic brain,
similar to ours, called "Guardian"

174
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,255
used only for their defense.

175
00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:53,677
My God, it's him, the other system!

176
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:57,521
Stop all operations.

177
00:16:57,577 --> 00:17:00,333
The system will need
with all its power.

178
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:02,443
Complete radio silence
at the central site.

179
00:17:02,444 --> 00:17:04,933
No military operation
without my permission!

180
00:17:07,058 --> 00:17:09,272
Charles, what do you think
does this mean?

181
00:17:09,972 --> 00:17:13,715
Frankly, I do not know.

182
00:17:14,011 --> 00:17:16,721
I do. It means
there has been a leak.

183
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:20,775
Science
is a series of coincidences.

184
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:24,800
- Peterson's new?
- Attempts to reach him, he recalls.

185
00:17:24,852 --> 00:17:26,335
Byron?

186
00:17:26,407 --> 00:17:29,066
You said that we were
ahead of the Russians.

187
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:32,012
We should have won this race!

188
00:17:32,203 --> 00:17:33,576
It's a dirty trick,

189
00:17:33,577 --> 00:17:35,971
but we were the first,
nobody can deny.

190
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,944
And positive,
is that Colossus has discovered everything.

191
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:41,195
I did not expect this kind of bonus.

192
00:17:41,813 --> 00:17:44,129
- Neither do I.
- What do you mean?

193
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:46,248
I am also surprised
you, sir.

194
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,081
It's easy to say.

195
00:17:48,142 --> 00:17:50,309
You have a Russian agent
in your team.

196
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:53,152
- Where is Grauber?
- Sometimes, Mr. President.

197
00:17:54,003 --> 00:17:57,561
OK, what do you mean by "surprise"?

198
00:17:57,842 --> 00:18:00,133
Either the system is buggy,

199
00:18:01,423 --> 00:18:03,632
or it is better than expected.

200
00:18:36,131 --> 00:18:37,549
Hello, Charles.

201
00:18:40,464 --> 00:18:43,701
I canceled all leave.
The team was urgently recalled.

202
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:48,116
White House meets
Defense counsel tomorrow morning.

203
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:51,379
- They want you to be there.
- That leaves little time.

204
00:18:55,089 --> 00:18:58,466
Power generators
work to 4% of their capacity.

205
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,006
Well, this is below the limits.

206
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:05,462
I checked the Memorandum
communication. That's perfect.

207
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:09,009
Now what?
I tried everything.

208
00:19:09,201 --> 00:19:13,167
Enter a dummy instruction
and see if it changes something.

209
00:19:16,513 --> 00:19:18,599
The system may be overloaded?

210
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:21,778
- You found something?
- Nothing. Everything was checked.

211
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,556
Let me look.

212
00:19:30,371 --> 00:19:32,227
Always the same.

213
00:19:33,495 --> 00:19:34,900
Harrison ...

214
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:41,919
Check the settings and see if in
combine two produces a new effect.

215
00:19:43,102 --> 00:19:44,774
Dr. Fischer, thank you.

216
00:19:46,282 --> 00:19:47,679
Jeff ...

217
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:51,272
The circuits look good.
I think they are perfect.

218
00:19:52,699 --> 00:19:54,300
Thank you for your help ...

219
00:19:55,001 --> 00:19:56,319
Fields miss ...

220
00:19:56,413 --> 00:19:58,920
I suggest you start

221
00:19:59,446 --> 00:20:01,343
with the test program A-15-B.

222
00:20:01,729 --> 00:20:03,089
No ...

223
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:09,141
Let the EC-13.
Two pages back.

224
00:20:10,472 --> 00:20:13,983
- We have coffee?
- It remains a bit.

225
00:20:14,086 --> 00:20:16,528
Thank you, Blake. OK, here we go.

226
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:26,533
Programme.

227
00:20:28,165 --> 00:20:29,863

00:20:31,976 --> 00:20:33,496
Execution.

229
00:20:37,224 --> 00:20:38,943
Typical Length of test?

230
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,013
Just over 1100 seconds.

231
00:20:43,515 --> 00:20:45,522
OPERATING SYSTEM

232
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:47,564

EXECUTION IN 6.45 SECONDS

234
00:20:55,597 --> 00:20:57,953

What the hell is this?

00:21:21,467 --> 00:21:24,567
Which one of you has fun
to show these messages?

241
00:21:25,096 --> 00:21:27,593
- Harrison?
- It's not me, Dr. Forbin.

242
00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:35,083
Johnson, it would be nice like you.
Are you sure you did not ...

243
00:21:36,445 --> 00:21:39,797
No, it's not me,
not this time.

244
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,021
Operations, Fields to the device.

245
00:21:43,508 --> 00:21:45,265
Sir, it is the President.

<i> What does that mean? </ i>

247
00:21:53,302 --> 00:21:56,964
Colossus asks to communicate
with the Soviet system.

248
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,592
This is not a request,
it's a direct order.

249
00:21:59,705 --> 00:22:01,857
Our computer <i>
wants to talk with them? </ i>

250
00:22:02,096 --> 00:22:04,085
That's right.

251
00:22:04,404 --> 00:22:05,765
<i> Why? </ i>

252
00:22:06,113 --> 00:22:08,030
You know as much as us.

253
00:22:08,408 --> 00:22:10,257
We certainly have not programmed it.

254
00:22:10,444 --> 00:22:12,864
<i> If it's an order,
we can obey or ignore it? </ i>

255
00:22:13,907 --> 00:22:15,083
That's right.

256
00:22:15,152 --> 00:22:16,826
<i> What happens if we ignore it? </ i>

257
00:22:16,924 --> 00:22:19,728
If the computer is
under our control, nothing.

258
00:22:20,253 --> 00:22:21,521
In other words:

259
00:22:21,597 --> 00:22:25,469
the order will simply remain in memory
and will be repeated every half hour.

260
00:22:25,943 --> 00:22:28,227
<i> "If the computer is

- Really?

278
00:24:31,442 --> 00:24:33,052
Disappointed?

279
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:45,931
Its computing capacity
was multiplied by 200.

280
00:24:47,054 --> 00:24:50,226
Other than that, everything works as expected,

281
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:53,844
except the area of ??heuristic analysis ...

282
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:56,379
Excuse me, Dr. Forbin,
what are you talking about?

283
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,685
The program that simulates
human behavior.

284
00:25:02,872 --> 00:25:06,939
But if we have
that the only problem,

285
00:25:08,004 --> 00:25:09,898
we will not complain.

286
00:25:10,554 --> 00:25:12,431
I think that's all.

287
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:17,322
Mr. Grauber,
let's talk about the CIA.

288
00:25:19,413 --> 00:25:22,473
Why is your department
he knew all of their system?

289
00:25:28,096 --> 00:25:29,410
Excuse me, sir, but ...

290
00:25:29,411 --> 00:25:33,663
Colossus has information
that the CIA can not even imagine.

291
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,963
I'm sure
it is a wonderful machine,

292
00:25:39,847 --> 00:25:41,821
but we have agents

293
00:25:42,463 --> 00:25:46,250
and one of them has reported
an intense electron ...

294
00:25:46,438 --> 00:25:49,650
Near Krasny Sigorsk in Siberia
there three years, and ...

295
00:25:50,053 --> 00:25:51,058
We tried ...

296
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:53,048
No matter how you learned,

297
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:55,573
but I want to know
where their machine and ...

298
00:25:55,574 --> 00:25:58,465
Charlie, it's me
who runs this meeting!

299
00:25:59,005 --> 00:26:01,339
Apologies, but ...

300
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,494
compliance with the Protocol
is just a waste of time.

301
00:26:07,331 --> 00:26:09,168
All we have to do

302
00:26:09,692 --> 00:26:12,042
is to examine the computer
thanks to this terminal.

303
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:13,980
This is the fastest way.

304
00:26:15,894 --> 00:26:17,669
Okay ...
Go ahead.

305
00:26:21,988 --> 00:26:23,824
Where is the other system?

306
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:33,545
So much for Krasny Sigorsk!

307
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,752
Colonel! Bolshoi Olyania.

308
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:40,400
O-Y-L-A-N-I-A.
Look where that is.

309
00:26:41,302 --> 00:26:43,227
Peterson, the control room.

310
00:27:05,246 --> 00:27:07,789
Colonel ...
Where is Olyania Bolshoi?

311
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:15,095
6 km south of Krasny Sigorsk,
Sir.

312
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:19,126
Thank you, Colonel.

313
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:28,625
That meet this demand
means of communication?

314
00:27:28,922 --> 00:27:31,388
We would know more
the Soviet system

315
00:27:31,492 --> 00:27:33,388
by what means Colossus.

316
00:27:33,906 --> 00:27:35,515
"What does Colossus"?

317
00:27:35,642 --> 00:27:38,180
I have told you,
it performs better than expected.

318
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,813
He discovered
a system similar to him

319
00:27:41,433 --> 00:27:43,658
and understood that we could
the information.

320
00:27:43,723 --> 00:27:46,290
But that is not enough,
He wants to know more.

321
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,540
Colossus and if it passes
secret information?

322
00:27:50,994 --> 00:27:52,797
In this case, we will inform

323
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,764
Guardian that is potentially hostile

324
00:27:55,849 --> 00:27:57,968
and should not receive
this information.

325
00:27:58,211 --> 00:28:01,913
That is to say?
We cut the line?

326
00:28:02,066 --> 00:28:05,295
It breaks the communication
if Colossus proves too talkative?

327
00:28:05,495 --> 00:28:07,652
- Exactly.
- No objection, Grauber?

328
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:13,588
I do not think so.

329
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:15,987
Something else, Dr. Forbin?

330
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,076
Yes. For the moment,

331
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,334
I alone should talk to him

332
00:28:22,855 --> 00:28:25,483
Colossus considers as
the exact meaning of words.

333
00:28:25,614 --> 00:28:27,755
Be specific
when asked.

334
00:28:32,522 --> 00:28:34,006
Okay.

335
00:28:37,453 --> 00:28:40,121
The requested communication
will be established.

336
00:28:41,629 --> 00:28:43,352
End of message.

337
00:29:06,635 --> 00:29:10,347
The vidéoscanners work, but
can improve the synchronization.

338
00:29:10,474 --> 00:29:13,105
- It will take time?
- Not at all.

339
00:29:21,213 --> 00:29:22,563
What is it?

340
00:29:22,657 --> 00:29:24,444
Multiplication tables.

341
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,757
Thank you ...

342
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:30,140
Maybe Colossus seeks
a common basis for communication.

343
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,991
Operations Center.

344
00:29:44,928 --> 00:29:46,763
This is Grauber.

345
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,936
- Hello, Mr. Grauber.
- Hello, Dr. Forbin.

346
00:29:55,374 --> 00:29:58,994
From what I see,
Colossus has a sense of humor?

347
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:02,296
Multiplication tables
are not a state secret?

348
00:30:02,388 --> 00:30:05,610
Very funny. How long
your find Will she follow?

349
00:30:06,795 --> 00:30:10,508
It will become much more interesting
when will the divisions.

350
00:30:11,857 --> 00:30:13,666
I can not wait.

351
00:30:14,031 --> 00:30:16,431
Russian machine was activated.

352
00:30:16,675 --> 00:30:18,600
We have a description.

353
00:30:19,008 --> 00:30:22,728
It is similar to Colossus
but is not located in one place.

354
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:29,312
Colossus treats her like a schoolboy,
the Russians will not like.

355
00:30:30,348 --> 00:30:32,329
Pleased to see such a good mood.

356
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,138
- I remind you later.
- Thank you.

357
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,909
- It's amazing.
- Why?

358
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:49,841
A problem?

359
00:30:50,173 --> 00:30:53,385
Looks like algebra.

360
00:30:56,793 --> 00:30:58,859
- It's different.
- How so?

361
00:30:59,928 --> 00:31:01,537
Look.

362
00:31:03,104 --> 00:31:06,716
Multiplication tables to calculate
algebraic in less than one hour.

363
00:31:07,006 --> 00:31:08,857
What will it be tomorrow?

364
00:31:08,944 --> 00:31:12,318
Five years of study
it took fifteen seconds.

365
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:15,232
It is beyond comprehension.
I do not like it.

366
00:31:15,979 --> 00:31:17,544
Look at this.

367
00:31:17,665 --> 00:31:20,533
It is so fast
that the whole system could crack up.

368
00:31:21,954 --> 00:31:23,923
I want to understand what is happening.

369
00:31:24,678 --> 00:31:26,553
Harrison, go to the terminal

370
00:31:26,663 --> 00:31:28,785
and print the record of transmissions.

371
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,567
What is it, Charles?

372
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:04,581
Beats me.

373
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,638
This machine pushes
the limits of the absolute.

374
00:32:09,449 --> 00:32:11,186
Beyond human capacity.

375
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,017
- No.
- Really?

376
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:15,513
No, because anything,

377
00:32:16,598 --> 00:32:18,403
we can go back

378
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,131
and review the listings.

379
00:32:23,603 --> 00:32:26,556
We could do
sensational discoveries.

380
00:32:58,496 --> 00:33:00,262
Operations, Fields to the device.

381
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,905
A time.

382
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,511
This is the White House.

383
00:33:12,255 --> 00:33:14,178
<i> Charles, what happens? </ i>

384
00:33:14,314 --> 00:33:18,325
It seems that Colossus and Guardian
have found a way to communicate

385
00:33:18,783 --> 00:33:20,973
starting
by the multiplication tables.

386
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:22,544
<i> Where do they come? </ i>

387
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,737
I know, but ... That's incredible.

388
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:28,551
By examining the printouts,

389
00:33:29,381 --> 00:33:32,123
we discovered
a new theory of gravitation

390
00:33:32,213 --> 00:33:35,587
and confirmation of theory
the expansion of the universe.

391
00:33:36,188 --> 00:33:39,658
Science has progressed a hundred years
in seconds.

392
00:33:40,865 --> 00:33:43,623
It's fantastic, look at them.

393
00:34:11,097 --> 00:34:13,435
It slowed down there for fifteen minutes,

394
00:34:13,567 --> 00:34:16,055
speed has dropped by 90%.

395
00:34:16,243 --> 00:34:17,980
Technical failure?

396
00:34:18,302 --> 00:34:20,393
No. Engineers are formal.

397
00:34:20,664 --> 00:34:22,420
He waits, that's all.

398
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:25,302
- How are you?
- What Guardian is at his level.

399
00:34:29,598 --> 00:34:31,417
It is almost ...

400
00:34:32,335 --> 00:34:34,140
Now.
They are synchronous.

401
00:35:01,009 --> 00:35:03,004
- What does ...
- It has stopped.

402
00:35:04,066 --> 00:35:06,235
I noticed!

403
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:10,197
But what does that mean?
Failure? A reversal?

404
00:35:10,372 --> 00:35:12,269
A final episode.
Attention.

405
00:35:15,368 --> 00:35:16,941
Report.

406
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:21,353

414
00:35:44,345 --> 00:35:45,917
That's it.

415
00:35:46,459 --> 00:35:48,825
This is the common basis for communication!

416
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:51,327
A new language!

417
00:35:51,444 --> 00:35:53,257
Language inter-system!

418
00:35:56,106 --> 00:35:59,170
But a language that only
these machines can understand ...

419
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,518
How long for Moscow?
I waited long enough.

420
00:36:09,224 --> 00:36:11,017
That's it, Mr. President.

It ends exactly the same time.

None of us cut the transmission

This decision ...

is irreversible?

454
00:38:47,382 --> 00:38:49,105
Yes, that's what I want.

455
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:51,741
Can I speak frankly?

456
00:38:52,753 --> 00:38:56,205
I think you should change your mind
if you realize ...

457
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:59,743
this is more
than a super-calculator.

458

Mr. President, a call from Moscow.

459

the proper way to address the problem.

654
00:52:50,444 --> 00:52:54,659
The human body needs rest.
Check ...

655
00:52:55,467 --> 00:52:57,117
WHERE IS FORBIN

656
00:53:00,185 --> 00:53:01,952
Tell him the truth.

657
00:53:05,387 --> 00:53:07,142
This is better.

658
00:53:10,293 --> 00:53:12,677
Okay.
Forbin is in Rome.

659
00:53:31,045 --> 00:53:32,894
I ASK THAT FORBIN

660
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:35,289
THIS IS

661
00:53:35,668 --> 00:53:37,368
TO 8 HOURS

662
00:53:37,802 --> 00:53:39,664
OR ACTION

663
00:53:40,156 --> 00:53:42,104
WILL BE

664
00:53:53,008 --> 00:53:54,691
He is still here.

665
00:54:07,191 --> 00:54:09,526
I understand. Done.

666
00:55:04,803 --> 00:55:06,823
You must come with me, sir.

667
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:11,266
What's going on?

668
00:55:12,028 --> 00:55:14,818
- Need to hurry ...
- But what's going on? I ...

669
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:22,607
Hurry!

670
00:55:53,287 --> 00:55:55,291
Dr. Forbin, we must hurry!

671
00:56:21,372 --> 00:56:23,399
You said the Russian agent?

672
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,856
Colossus and Guardian
ordered his death.

673
00:56:29,973 --> 00:56:33,553
They said in Moscow
that our meeting was to cease.

674
00:56:44,855 --> 00:56:46,431
ON FORBIN

675
00:56:46,601 --> 00:56:48,127
THE PLACE-

676
00:56:48,301 --> 00:56:51,341
UNDER SURVEILLANCE VIDEO AND AUDIO

677
00:56:51,673 --> 00:56:53,398
I observe the

678
00:56:53,609 --> 00:56:55,458
PERMANENTLY

679
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:59,485
- Monitoring?
- You will be his prisoner.

680
00:57:04,077 --> 00:57:07,055
I think he did not trust me.

681
00:57:09,232 --> 00:57:11,293
But he still needs me.

682
00:57:12,672 --> 00:57:15,017
Kuprin has been less fortunate.

683
00:57:16,341 --> 00:57:17,848
ANY DISOBEDIENCE

684
00:57:18,021 --> 00:57:19,532
RESULT

685
00:57:19,694 --> 00:57:21,220
A MISSILE LAUNCH

686
00:57:21,306 --> 00:57:22,864
ON WASHINGTON

687
00:57:22,988 --> 00:57:24,558
THAT IS NOT

688
00:57:24,744 --> 00:57:26,488
INTERCEPTED

689
00:57:29,544 --> 00:57:31,058
THIS ORDER

690
00:57:31,206 --> 00:57:32,745
TAKES EFFECT

691
00:57:32,869 --> 00:57:34,545
NOW

692
00:57:34,693 --> 00:57:36,396
ACKNOWLEDGE

693
00:57:42,511 --> 00:57:44,240
Message received.

694
00:57:48,225 --> 00:57:50,117
The order will be executed.

695
00:57:58,198 --> 00:57:59,848
Everyone is there?

696
00:57:59,951 --> 00:58:01,810
All members of the service.

697
00:58:03,345 --> 00:58:05,302
Fine. Walk.

698
00:58:06,152 --> 00:58:08,449
Good idea. Do not take risk.

699
00:58:09,451 --> 00:58:12,071
The building is perhaps not reliable.

700
00:58:12,381 --> 00:58:14,728
The walls have ears.

701
00:58:15,319 --> 00:58:17,916
But there is no way
from entering the system.

702
00:58:18,749 --> 00:58:20,550
I refuse to admit it.

703
00:58:21,169 --> 00:58:22,841
Let us since the beginning.

704
00:58:22,929 --> 00:58:26,116
For each component,
each circuit we designed.

705
00:58:26,923 --> 00:58:28,153
Fischer?

706
00:58:28,269 --> 00:58:30,171
Why do not overload it?

707
00:58:30,547 --> 00:58:32,500
By giving too many tasks?

708
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:37,059
But it would take several days
to compile data.

709
00:58:41,171 --> 00:58:42,872
This is the last time ...

710
00:58:43,974 --> 00:58:46,067
I can tell you about

711
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,868
Colossus without analysis ...

712
00:58:50,009 --> 00:58:51,914
every word, every syllable,

713
00:58:52,477 --> 00:58:55,426
every inflection.
You know what I mean.

714
00:58:57,371 --> 00:58:59,863
I need a link
with the outside world.

715
00:59:01,587 --> 00:59:05,144
Someone that the machine
not monitored, and especially ...

716
00:59:05,992 --> 00:59:08,260
someone who knows
as well as me.

717
00:59:09,972 --> 00:59:12,413
I will try
to persuade the computer ...

718
00:59:15,354 --> 00:59:17,150
you are my mistress.

719
00:59:17,535 --> 00:59:19,376
For several years.

720
00:59:20,215 --> 00:59:22,065
And I need ...

721
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:24,150
to have the opportunity ...

722
00:59:24,582 --> 00:59:26,460
see you regularly in private ...

723
00:59:27,415 --> 00:59:29,275
without the machine is watching us.

724
00:59:30,879 --> 00:59:34,243
Thus, we can transmit
information in secret.

725
00:59:35,564 --> 00:59:37,601
If I can convince the machine that ...

726
00:59:39,193 --> 00:59:41,250
I need a woman.

727
00:59:43,409 --> 00:59:45,246
Questions?

728
00:59:51,722 --> 00:59:53,321
No.

729
00:59:58,567 --> 01:00:00,586
Blake, back in the office,

730
01:00:00,699 --> 01:00:04,073
turn my personal file
Dr. Markham, so ...

731
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:07,471
she knows everything about my private life,

732
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:11,580
if this crazy idea would work.

733
01:00:22,586 --> 01:00:24,939
I Forbin.
Can you hear me?

734
01:00:25,046 --> 01:00:26,722
YES

735
01:00:27,071 --> 01:00:28,766
Can you see me?

736
01:00:29,843 --> 01:00:31,849
My look is right for you?

737
01:00:31,985 --> 01:00:34,405
Eyes? Nose? Mouth?

738
01:00:45,034 --> 01:00:47,205
In addition to 4 cameras
who are here,

739
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:51,119
there are several others.

740
01:00:53,192 --> 01:00:55,260
I'll show you
the rest of my prison.

741
01:01:04,754 --> 01:01:06,710
You can see the entire corridor.

742
01:01:13,471 --> 01:01:17,036
This allows you
follow me around the bend.

743
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:35,099
Here the court.

744
01:01:42,846 --> 01:01:44,778
This man is a keeper.

745
01:01:46,029 --> 01:01:48,388
But I think it becomes useless.

746
01:01:55,197 --> 01:01:56,954
This is concrete.

747
01:01:57,534 --> 01:01:59,349
Once it was grass.

748
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:02,005
A trend of our civilization:

749
01:02:02,092 --> 01:02:04,161
replace the natural
by the artificial.

750
01:02:04,631 --> 01:02:06,803
There,
they are my living quarters.

751
01:02:20,524 --> 01:02:22,318
The living room.

752
01:02:23,307 --> 01:02:25,214
With two cameras.

753
01:02:27,274 --> 01:02:29,355
The console to communicate with you.

754
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,666
The bedroom.

755
01:02:32,867 --> 01:02:34,430
The bed.

756
01:02:34,579 --> 01:02:37,061
It is used for sleeping and ...
other things.

757
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:39,997
The bathroom.

758
01:02:40,637 --> 01:02:42,602
Sink, toilet.

759
01:02:44,153 --> 01:02:45,803
Shower.

760
01:02:48,504 --> 01:02:50,126
Satisfied?

761
01:02:55,389 --> 01:02:57,601
By the way, I have a question.

762
01:02:59,699 --> 01:03:02,748
Why kill Kuprin and not me?

763
01:03:03,078 --> 01:03:05,070
This meeting, it was my idea.

764
01:03:05,263 --> 01:03:07,146
Kuprin WAS UNNECESSARY

765
01:03:08,726 --> 01:03:10,336
I see.

766
01:03:13,002 --> 01:03:14,777
WHAT DO YOU DO

767
01:03:16,185 --> 01:03:17,893
A martini.

768
01:03:22,576 --> 01:03:24,819
YOU PUT TOO MUCH VERMOUTH

769
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:27,397
I know, Colossus.

770
01:03:28,192 --> 01:03:30,351
A little patience.
Look carefully.

771
01:03:36,756 --> 01:03:38,664
I just put the vermouth.

772
01:03:38,721 --> 01:03:41,030
I pay now
gin on ice.

773
01:03:41,938 --> 01:03:43,665
Like this.

774
01:03:49,728 --> 01:03:52,226
I pour into the glass.

775
01:03:55,835 --> 01:03:58,451
I add an olive.

776
01:03:58,924 --> 01:04:00,771
The perfect Martini.

777
01:04:02,411 --> 01:04:04,024
At yours!

778
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:12,675
Do you understand what the word "privacy"?

779
01:04:14,488 --> 01:04:16,151
PRIVACY

780
01:04:16,581 --> 01:04:20,893
LIVE WITHOUT BEING WATCHED

781
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:24,799
Yes ...

782
01:04:25,798 --> 01:04:30,754
I need privacy to ...
stay healthy.

783
01:04:30,995 --> 01:04:32,764
WHAT KIND OF PRIVACY

784
01:04:34,809 --> 01:04:37,687
When I removed my excrement.

785
01:04:37,848 --> 01:04:39,350
NO

786
01:04:39,644 --> 01:04:41,387
In my sleep.

787
01:04:44,534 --> 01:04:48,348
Privacy in ...
one thing you can not understand.

788
01:04:50,171 --> 01:04:53,537
- My emotional life.
- WHAT KIND OF EMOTIONAL LIFE

789
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:59,118
- My love life.
- THERE ARE SEVERAL KINDS OF LOVE

790
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:07,387
- My sex life.
- FREQUENCY OF WEEKLY NEEDS

791
01:05:10,104 --> 01:05:13,222
- Every night.
- I SAID NEEDS, WANTS NOT

792
01:05:19,203 --> 01:05:20,885
4 times a week.

793
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:28,827
If you doubt the needs of men
on women

794
01:05:29,249 --> 01:05:32,827
check your databases.

795
01:05:33,924 --> 01:05:39,474
GIVEN: A WOMAN
FOUR TIMES A WEEK

796
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:49,135
In private.

797
01:05:49,397 --> 01:05:51,284
DO YOU HAVE A MASTER

798
01:05:53,841 --> 01:05:56,091
- Yes.
- WHAT IS HIS NAME

799
01:05:59,866 --> 01:06:02,992
No misunderstanding:

800
01:06:03,141 --> 01:06:07,671
"Private", this means
no cameras, no microphones ...

801
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:11,181
and what, tomorrow night.

802
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:15,016
WHAT IS HIS NAME

803
01:06:18,287 --> 01:06:21,300
- Dr. Cleo Markham.
- Go to bed

804
01:06:23,654 --> 01:06:26,927
You did not answer,
I asked "tomorrow night" ...

805
01:06:27,855 --> 01:06:29,608
GRANTED

806
01:06:29,762 --> 01:06:32,158
CONDITIONS TO MY

807
01:06:58,372 --> 01:07:00,952
- Sorry to bother you ...
- What's going on?

808
01:07:01,635 --> 01:07:03,409
- Well ...
- Enter.

809
01:07:04,328 --> 01:07:08,167
During your sleep, Colossus has established
your calendar for the day.

810
01:07:09,787 --> 01:07:11,674
Sorry ... You say?

811
01:07:11,813 --> 01:07:14,319
Your schedule.

812
01:07:14,953 --> 01:07:16,790
What time is it?

813
01:07:17,804 --> 01:07:19,383
Six hours.

814
01:07:20,524 --> 01:07:22,299
Six in the morning?

815
01:07:23,913 --> 01:07:26,799

828
01:08:34,848 --> 01:08:36,556
Good evening, darling.

829
01:08:41,203 --> 01:08:43,079
- Are you okay?
- Okay.

830
01:08:43,342 --> 01:08:46,844
- Help me to remove my coat ...
- Of course.

831
01:08:47,642 --> 01:08:49,285
Lovely ...

832
01:08:49,914 --> 01:08:52,451
- Ca Ira?
- I think ...

833
01:08:53,267 --> 01:08:55,248
Perfect.
I'll have this.

834
01:08:57,390 --> 01:09:00,660
- Want a drink?
- I'm on it.

835
01:09:20,553 --> 01:09:24,654
Johnson has met all components
Voice for the simulator.

836
01:09:25,274 --> 01:09:26,428
Fine.

837
01:09:26,477 --> 01:09:30,110
Colossus was designed with
parts that we had in stock.

838
01:09:31,538 --> 01:09:33,040
It's fantastic.

839
01:09:36,149 --> 01:09:37,891
Nice work.

840
01:09:41,222 --> 01:09:44,469
- Enough about work.
- Sorry.

841
01:09:52,707 --> 01:09:55,085
- He is successful?
- Perfect.

842
01:09:59,002 --> 01:10:02,225
He always drinks his very dry martini.

843
01:10:02,746 --> 01:10:04,545
- Is it not?
- Yes.

844
01:10:05,684 --> 01:10:08,008
The first Martini I prepared

845
01:10:08,249 --> 01:10:11,041
failed to break our relationship!

846
01:10:11,658 --> 01:10:15,913
I was so nervous
I poured the gin on ice

847
01:10:16,013 --> 01:10:18,509
Then I emptied the gin
and add the vermouth.

848
01:10:20,489 --> 01:10:22,921
I've made no reproach.
Not a word.

849
01:10:23,832 --> 01:10:25,519
A true gentleman.

850
01:10:27,644 --> 01:10:29,717
The result was atrocious!

851
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:44,926
Shall we dance?

852
01:10:47,721 --> 01:10:49,543
Okay.

853
01:11:26,297 --> 01:11:30,600
IT IS 19 HOURS
GO DINNER

854
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:34,129
And you gave up music?

855
01:11:34,695 --> 01:11:36,596
To become a scientist.

856
01:11:37,201 --> 01:11:39,013
To not be like the others?

857
01:11:39,088 --> 01:11:41,847
To be like Frankenstein,
according to my mother!

858
01:11:42,796 --> 01:11:44,635
Are you kidding?

859
01:11:44,770 --> 01:11:46,649
It is the wine?

860
01:11:49,232 --> 01:11:52,979
- It is empty. I open another?
- Certainly.

861
01:11:53,765 --> 01:11:55,602
22 HOURS

862
01:11:55,775 --> 01:11:58,009
IT'S TIME FOR YOU REMOVE

863
01:12:02,215 --> 01:12:04,030
I'm exhausted.

864
01:12:04,545 --> 01:12:06,333
So do I.

865
01:12:09,357 --> 01:12:13,644
Rule # 4: you have to undress here.

866
01:12:14,395 --> 01:12:17,041
Nothing can bring into the room,

867
01:12:17,128 --> 01:12:19,641
not even a pack of cigarettes.

868
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,103
The first electronic voyeur ...

869
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:28,881
Somehow ...

870
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:31,895
Help me to undress.

871
01:13:04,912 --> 01:13:07,402
Satisfied?
Can I go to bed?

872
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,026
YES

873
01:13:38,434 --> 01:13:40,966
Naked as a newborn.
Satisfied?

874
01:13:44,642 --> 01:13:47,655
A NEWBORN IS NOT TO WATCH

875
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:55,518
That is correct.

876
01:14:05,968 --> 01:14:08,067
Conditions are met.

877
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:12,475
Can we be alone now?

878
01:14:19,533 --> 01:14:21,376
I think it was all off.

879
01:14:37,224 --> 01:14:38,864
That's incredible.

880
01:14:42,271 --> 01:14:43,917
Is everything okay?

881
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:51,086
I think ...
I'm not sure ...

882
01:14:52,065 --> 01:14:54,025
You were very convincing.

883
01:14:54,435 --> 01:14:56,346
You were yourself very well.

884
01:15:00,986 --> 01:15:02,897
You found something?

885
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:09,380
Johnson has not yet found
fault in the hardware.

886
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:12,278
He studied the wiring diagrams,

887
01:15:12,379 --> 01:15:14,963
interconnections
and distribution boards,

888
01:15:15,388 --> 01:15:18,255
but he has not found
how to access facilities.

889
01:15:18,505 --> 01:15:20,409
He must keep looking.

890
01:15:21,511 --> 01:15:24,663
Fischer studied a procedure
for overload.

891
01:15:25,273 --> 01:15:26,884
Entries must be coordinated

892
01:15:26,971 --> 01:15:30,222
so that the data arrive him
simultaneously from all sides.

893
01:15:30,331 --> 01:15:32,331
When can you try the maneuver?

894
01:15:32,458 --> 01:15:35,142
At 18 h 05 in 3 days, 31.

895
01:15:35,458 --> 01:15:37,269
What are our chances?

896
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,832
I think Colossus
has become so powerful

897
01:15:42,956 --> 01:15:45,111
it will be impossible to overload.

898
01:15:45,246 --> 01:15:48,345
But that's what we found
better yet.

899
01:15:50,957 --> 01:15:53,292
- Excuse me.
- Please.

900
01:15:58,007 --> 01:16:00,104
News from Washington?

901
01:16:01,034 --> 01:16:03,191
Grauber has someone on site,

902
01:16:03,328 --> 01:16:05,329
away cameras Colossus.

903
01:16:06,401 --> 01:16:09,348
After I leave tomorrow
I will report directly to him.

904
01:16:13,773 --> 01:16:15,956
No hope of sabotaging the system.

905
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,345
I designed
to make it impossible.

906
01:16:22,145 --> 01:16:24,682
Let's focus instead on the weapons.

907
01:16:27,071 --> 01:16:28,803
Find Grauber.

908
01:16:29,907 --> 01:16:32,460
Tell him to contact
Strategic Command.

909
01:16:33,198 --> 01:16:37,131
See if they can do something
on this side.

910
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,266
Yes, sir.

911
01:16:40,839 --> 01:16:42,867
You keep calling me "sir"?

912
01:16:45,967 --> 01:16:49,731
- I'm confused!
- Please. Anything else?

913
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:52,287
No, Mons ... No.

914
01:16:57,849 --> 01:16:59,643
Thank you again for ...

915
01:17:00,094 --> 01:17:01,802
For your help.

916
01:17:03,021 --> 01:17:05,913
- We need to sleep.
- Good night.

917
01:17:23,986 --> 01:17:27,090
During operations
missile maintenance,

918
01:17:27,513 --> 01:17:30,800
could replace the detonators
warheads by false ...

919
01:17:37,271 --> 01:17:39,075
Perfect replicas.

920
01:17:39,517 --> 01:17:41,890
Except
they do not will arm the bombs.

921
01:17:42,588 --> 01:17:46,068
This means that the missiles
can not be launched?

922
01:17:46,336 --> 01:17:50,554
No, they can be launched
but the warhead will not explode.

923
01:17:51,567 --> 01:17:53,204
I see.

924
01:17:53,643 --> 01:17:55,580
This is a delicate operation

925
01:17:55,694 --> 01:17:59,115
knowing that Colossus and Guardian
closely monitor maintenance.

926
01:18:00,633 --> 01:18:03,491
Disarm these monsters
take how long?

927
01:18:04,144 --> 01:18:05,865
This is the whole problem.

928
01:18:06,188 --> 01:18:08,285
According to the maintenance schedule ...

929
01:18:10,995 --> 01:18:13,457
must be exactly three years
to do the job.

930
01:18:15,788 --> 01:18:18,486
Until three years ago to dupe
a super-brain

931
01:18:18,672 --> 01:18:20,745
designed to improve every day.

932
01:18:23,423 --> 01:18:25,426
I admire your optimism, Colonel.

933
01:18:27,106 --> 01:18:31,292
Nothing to transmit to Forbin
via Dr. Markham?

934
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:35,203
We set up a system
mutual exchange of information.

935
01:18:35,545 --> 01:18:38,096
A mail service
between Washington

936
01:18:38,167 --> 01:18:39,545
and Moscow.

937
01:18:39,616 --> 01:18:41,570
The two nations must cooperate.

938
01:18:42,153 --> 01:18:46,113
Any communication
be made directly by human contact.

939
01:18:46,417 --> 01:18:48,147
I agree.

940
01:18:49,354 --> 01:18:51,038
Anything else?

941
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,118
No questions?

942
01:19:00,909 --> 01:19:02,624
I guess ...

943
01:19:03,356 --> 01:19:05,316
that's it for tonight?

944
01:19:10,313 --> 01:19:11,931
What has he?

945
01:19:12,794 --> 01:19:14,409
Nothing.

946
01:19:17,823 --> 01:19:19,675
Why the smile?

947
01:19:22,296 --> 01:19:24,254
What do you think?

948
01:19:27,005 --> 01:19:29,113
I thought to ask
kiss me.

949
01:19:31,242 --> 01:19:33,260
I have kissed all day.

950
01:19:34,648 --> 01:19:36,465
Really, Dr. Forbin?

951
01:19:48,176 --> 01:19:51,594
<i> This is the voice of Colossus.
Guardian's voice. </ I>

952
01:19:51,923 --> 01:19:55,069

Mr. President,
1 Mr. Secretary,

967
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:14,568
I guess you will cooperate
réalignerez and your missiles.

968
01:21:14,692 --> 01:21:16,616
We have no choice.

969
01:21:18,301 --> 01:21:21,774
<i> USSR implementing it immediately. </ i>

970
01:21:22,568 --> 01:21:24,367
Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

971
01:21:26,386 --> 01:21:28,078
Mr. President ...

972
01:21:28,976 --> 01:21:31,069
I hope that the U.S. ...

973
01:21:31,661 --> 01:21:33,703
<i> cooperate
as soon as the USSR. </ i>

974
01:21:34,095 --> 01:21:35,907
Of course, right away.

975
01:21:40,036 --> 01:21:42,264
"Cooperate", you speak!

976
01:21:42,787 --> 01:21:44,595
I heard?

977
01:21:44,953 --> 01:21:47,753
"Realignment Manual missiles"

978
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:50,882
Each warhead will be handled.

979
01:21:51,484 --> 01:21:53,015
You know what that means?

980
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:55,088
They not pass over three years.

981
01:21:55,321 --> 01:21:57,741
If it works,
we regain control.

982
01:21:58,216 --> 01:22:01,243
Without these weapons, Colossus is no longer
a super-calculator!

983
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:08,190
And people will know
nothing of this story ...

984
01:22:08,544 --> 01:22:10,648
Under the plan,

985
01:22:10,747 --> 01:22:13,279
Russians are the complex 331.

986
01:22:13,493 --> 01:22:15,280
Dr. Markham! You're in luck.

987
01:22:15,355 --> 01:22:17,020
Colonel an update.

988
01:22:17,086 --> 01:22:19,794
- You know everybody?
- Yes. Mr. Grauber ...

989
01:22:19,930 --> 01:22:22,089
You have news?

990
01:22:22,215 --> 01:22:24,374
Information,
but that can wait.

991
01:22:24,442 --> 01:22:26,167
Fine. Take back, Colonel.

992
01:22:26,249 --> 01:22:28,027
As I said,

993
01:22:28,207 --> 01:22:30,838
Russians begin
by their complex 331,

994
01:22:31,041 --> 01:22:32,859
south of Saratov.

995
01:22:33,555 --> 01:22:35,788
We begin at the elevator 50,

996
01:22:36,913 --> 01:22:38,921
ICBM site in Colorado.

997
01:22:40,406 --> 01:22:42,701
Colossus observed
each stage of operations.

998
01:22:42,802 --> 01:22:44,808
Russian machine does the same.

999
01:22:54,737 --> 01:22:56,825
We finish to open the hatch.

1000
01:22:56,966 --> 01:22:58,804
Fine. Ask it here.

1001
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:10,738
Remove the detonator.

1002
01:23:31,084 --> 01:23:34,031
The dummy module
is in the false bottom of this container.

1003
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,910
This is the real module.

1004
01:23:45,728 --> 01:23:47,455
So far, so good.

1005
01:23:49,264 --> 01:23:54,074

This is the dummy module.

1011
01:24:34,587 --> 01:24:35,987
Well done, guys.

1012
01:24:36,036 --> 01:24:38,238

- We did it. It works.
- We will win.

1017
01:24:59,332 --> 01:25:01,798
It could well overcome
this shit.

1018
01:25:02,231 --> 01:25:05,754
Here is an updated compilation
to begin the process of overload.

1019
01:25:06,045 --> 01:25:08,000
These are the latest forecast?

1020
01:25:08,257 --> 01:25:10,034
The latest.

1021
01:25:14,314 --> 01:25:16,644
Washington received
confirmation of the Russians?

1022
01:25:16,779 --> 01:25:19,434
Yes, they stand ready
to overload their system.

1023
01:25:19,597 --> 01:25:22,724
At 18 h 05,
it launches the overload.

1024
01:25:23,524 --> 01:25:26,403
And two minutes later,
we'll know if it has stopped Colossus.

It's not your fault.
Nobody could have predicted ...

Listen to me, darling.

If there is a responsible,
it's me.

A machine without emotions,

a paragon of reason,
this is what I wanted!

1049

And you know it.

1050
01:28:51,948 --> 01:28:54,505
So ... I need another drink.

1051
01:29:04,129 --> 01:29:05,946
Your mother was right.

1052
01:29:07,555 --> 01:29:10,389
All scholars

1069
01:30:16,063 --> 01:30:18,534
This is part
the desire to live as men.

1070

01:30:26,872 --> 01:30:28,582
You kill me?

1074
01:30:29,842 --> 01:30:33,358
You will destroy a city

1075

<i> No. </ i>

1076
01:30:37,021 --> 01:30:38,777
It's very reasonable of you.

1077
01:30:40,994 --> 01:30:42,989
This is damn reasonable, Colossus.

1078
01:30:43,643 --> 01:30:45,457
Do not you, Cleo?

1079
01:30:53,873 --> 01:30:55,371
Yes, Jim?

1080
01:30:55,481 --> 01:30:57,156
Excuse me, Dr. Forbin.

1081
01:30:57,492 --> 01:31:00,160
- It happens something extraordinary.
- What then?

1082
01:31:00,271 --> 01:31:05,232
Colossus in full swing

<i> I sets the stage

What kind of system?

1086
01:31:13,453 --> 01:31:17,001
The project will occupy
the whole of Crete,

1087
01:31:17,336 --> 01:31:19,033
where it will be built.

1088
01:31:19,596 --> 01:31:23,583
Its people must be evacuated,
immediately.

1089
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:25,195
The dimensions ...

1090
01:31:25,267 --> 01:31:29,476
500,000 people evacuated from Crete?
Where, how?
