00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:56,198
There's another famous midget I'm missing,
but I can't remember.

158
00:13:57,364 --> 00:14:00,156
It's not the R2-D2 man. No, he's still going.

159
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:06,157
I hope your midget doesn't kill himself.
Your dream sequence will be fucked.

<i>He doesn't like being called a midget.
He prefers "dwarf."</i>

161
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,823
Well, this is exactly my point!

162
00:14:11,907 --> 00:14:15,031
People go around calling you a midget
when you want to be called a dwarf.

163
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:17,907
Of course you're gonna blow your head off!

164
00:14:19,698 --> 00:14:22,364
- My name's Ray. What's yours?
- Chloe.

165
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,531
How did you get past the security man?

166
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,948
Getting past security men,
it's sort of my job.

167
00:14:30,032 --> 00:14:33,114
- You're a shoplifter?
- (CHUCKLES) No, not a shoplifter.

168
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,157
It's a good joke, though.

169
00:14:36,156 --> 00:14:37,281
No.

170
00:14:38,031 --> 00:14:40,282
I'll tell you what I am
at dinner tomorrow night.

171

172
00:14:57,031 --> 00:14:58,198
Fuck.

173

How fucking cool.

174
00:15:24,072 --> 00:15:25,864

175
00:15:25,947 --> 00:15:29,656
Yes. No, Mr Cranham.
No. Yes. Mr Blakely. Yes.

176

00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:39,320

188

(SOFTLY) You'll never guess what.

189
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:04,155
Will you shut your fucking mouth, please,
and go to sleep?

190
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:05,905
Oh, sorry.

191
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:13,403
Except I've gotta take me contact lenses out.

192

Altogether,

193
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:23,489
I had

194
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,738
five pints of beer and six bottles.

195
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:33,529
No. Six pints of beer and seven bottles.

196
00:17:33,613 --> 00:17:36,237
And you know what? I'm not even pissed!

197
00:17:42,155 --> 00:17:44,320
You'll never guess what, Ken.

198
00:17:45,988 --> 00:17:48,154
- Ken, you'll never guess what.
- What?

199
00:17:48,237 --> 00:17:50,488
- Got a date for tomorrow night.
- I'm very happy for you.

200
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:53,071
- With a girl.
- Can you turn the light off, please?

201
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,987
Only been in Bruges one day,
got a date with a girl in the film business,

202
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:58,153
the Belgian film business.

203
00:17:59,403 --> 00:18:01,946
They're doing a film about a midget.

204
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,403
Miss?

205
00:18:22,237 --> 00:18:23,403
Marie?

206
00:18:26,654 --> 00:18:31,071
Sorry about the message last night.
The man who left it is a bit of a...

207
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,528
Well, he's a bit of a...

208
00:18:35,154 --> 00:18:36,237
Cock?

209
00:18:37,402 --> 00:18:39,447
Yes. He's a bit of a cock.

210
00:18:42,694 --> 00:18:43,946
Morning.

211
00:18:53,195 --> 00:18:55,194
Harry called last night.

212
00:18:55,819 --> 00:18:57,362
We missed him.

213
00:19:00,153 --> 00:19:02,654
Jeez, he swears a lot, doesn't he?

214
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,903
We're staying in tonight. Whatever happens.

215
00:19:07,487 --> 00:19:08,527
Hmm.

216
00:19:10,028 --> 00:19:11,362
Except...

217
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,318
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

218
00:19:15,402 --> 00:19:16,985
Except "hmm" what?

219
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:21,819
Except only one of us
needs to stay in, really.

220
00:19:24,693 --> 00:19:27,362
And which one of us
would that be, now, Ray?

221
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:30,735
- I thought you didn't like Bruges.
- I don't like Bruges, it's a shithole.

222
00:19:30,819 --> 00:19:34,611
But I did already say
I had a date with a Belgian lady

223
00:19:34,694 --> 00:19:38,737
in the Belgian film business,
which I did already say about before.

224
00:19:43,194 --> 00:19:45,945
Just don't get into any fucking trouble.

225
00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:48,111
We're keeping a low profile.

226
00:19:48,735 --> 00:19:54,902
And this morning, and this afternoon,
we are doing what I want to do.

227
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,736
- Got it?
- Of course.

228
00:19:57,612 --> 00:19:59,487
Which, I presume, will involve culture.

229
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,277
Oh, we shall strike a balance
between culture and fun.

230
00:20:03,361 --> 00:20:07,944
Somehow I believe, Ken, that the balance
shall tip in the favour of culture.

231
00:20:08,944 --> 00:20:12,777
Like a big, fat,
fucking retarded, fucking black girl

232
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,569
on a seesaw, opposite

233
00:20:19,277 --> 00:20:20,570
a dwarf.

234
00:20:50,485 --> 00:20:52,902
(DRAGGING FEET)

235
00:20:56,611 --> 00:21:00,777
(SOFTLY) Ray, did we or did we not agree
that if I let you go on your date tonight,

236
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,778
we'd do the things I wanted to do today?

237
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,735
We are doing the things
that you wanted to do today.

238
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:07,360
And that we'd do them
without you throwing a fucking moody,

239
00:21:07,443 --> 00:21:09,778
like some 5-year-old
who's dropped all his sweets?

240
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,818
I didn't agree to that.

241
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:14,778
I'll cheer up. I'll cheer up.

242
00:21:15,193 --> 00:21:18,152
Up there, the top altar, is a phial

243
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,444
brought back by a Flemish knight
from the Crusades in the Holy Land.

244
00:21:22,527 --> 00:21:25,110
And that phial,
do you know what it's said to contain?

245
00:21:25,192 --> 00:21:26,734
No, what's it said to contain?

246
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:30,777
It's said to contain
some drops of Jesus Christ's blood.

247
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,570
Yeah, that's how this church got its name.
Basilica of the Holy Blood.

248
00:21:34,653 --> 00:21:35,985
Yeah. Yeah.

249
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:38,944
And this blood, right,
though it's dried blood,

250
00:21:39,027 --> 00:21:43,111
at different times over many years,
they say it turned back into liquid.

251
00:21:43,193 --> 00:21:45,819
Turned back into liquid from dried blood.

252
00:21:45,902 --> 00:21:48,026
At various times of great

253
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:50,859
stress.

254
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,236
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

255
00:21:52,318 --> 00:21:57,402
So, yeah, I'm gonna go up in the queue
and touch it, which is what you do.

256
00:21:57,485 --> 00:21:59,610
- Yeah?
- Yeah. You coming?

Do I have to?

258

Do you have to?
Of course you don't have to.

259

It's Jesus' fucking blood, isn't it?
Of course you don't fucking have to!

- Well, it's, you know, the final day on Earth.

KEN: I don't know, Ray.
I don't know what I believe.

295

The things you're taught as a child,
they never really leave you, do they?

296
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,188
So, like, I believe
in trying to lead a good life.

297
00:27:42,272 --> 00:27:45,940
Like, if there's an old lady,
carrying her shopping home,

298
00:27:46,024 --> 00:27:49,732
I don't try and help her carry her shopping,
I don't go that far,

299
00:27:49,815 --> 00:27:53,982
but I'll certainly hold the door open for her
and that, and let her go out before me.

300
00:27:54,064 --> 00:27:56,188
Yeah. And anyway, if you tried
to help her carry her shopping,

301
00:27:56,272 --> 00:27:58,188
she'd probably think
you were just trying to nick her shopping.

302
00:27:58,273 --> 00:28:01,106
- Exactly.
- This is the world we live in today.

303
00:28:01,188 --> 00:28:04,481
At the same time
as trying to lead a good life,

304
00:28:05,857 --> 00:28:10,188
I have to reconcile myself with the fact
that, yes, I have killed people.

305
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:14,689
Not many people.
Most of them were not very nice people.

306
00:28:15,231 --> 00:28:17,397
Apart from one person.

307
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,356
- Who's that?
- This fellow, Danny Aliband's brother.

308
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,897
He was just trying to protect his brother.
Like you or I would.

309
00:28:24,981 --> 00:28:27,273
He was just a lollipop man.

310
00:28:27,358 --> 00:28:30,773
He came at me with a bottle.

It's a case of it's you or him.

317

If he'd come at you with his bare hands,
that'd be different.

your bare hands can kill somebody, too.

00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,265
As I say, I think he was just glad
to get out and about.

464
00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:17,349
<i>So, is he having a nice time,
seeing all the canals and that?</i>

465
00:39:17,432 --> 00:39:19,599
<i>I had a lovelytime when I was there.</i>

466
00:39:19,683 --> 00:39:22,183
<i>All the canals
and the old buildings and that.</i>

467
00:39:22,265 --> 00:39:23,349
When were you here?

468
00:39:23,432 --> 00:39:27,266
<i>When I was seven.
Last happyholidayl fucking had.</i>

469
00:39:27,767 --> 00:39:30,392
<i>- Have you been on a canal trip, yet?
- Yeah.</i>

470
00:39:30,474 --> 00:39:32,642
<i>Have you been down, like,
all the old cobbled streets and that?</i>

471
00:39:32,726 --> 00:39:33,767
Yeah.

472
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:36,058
<i>- It's like a fairytale, isn't it, that place?
- Yeah.</i>

473
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,058
<i>- With the churches and that. They're Gothic.
- Yeah.</i>

474
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,683
<i>- Is it Gothic?
- Yeah.</i>

475
00:39:39,766 --> 00:39:42,307
<i>So he's having a reallynice time?</i>

476
00:39:42,391 --> 00:39:45,225
Well, I'm having a really nice time.

477
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:48,058
I'm not sure if it's really his cup of tea.

478
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:51,932
<i>What?</i>

479
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,431
You know, I'm not sure
if it's really his thing.

480
00:39:54,516 --> 00:39:56,099
<i>What do you mean,
"It's not reallyhis thing"?</i>

481
00:39:56,182 --> 00:39:58,308
<i>What's that supposed to mean,
"It's not reallyhis thing"?</i>

482
00:39:58,392 --> 00:40:00,807
<i>- What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing, Harry.</i>

483
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:02,974
<i>It's a fairytale fucking town, isn't it?</i>

484
00:40:03,057 --> 00:40:05,808
<i>How can a fairytale town
not be somebody's fucking thing?</i>

485
00:40:05,891 --> 00:40:09,016
<i>How can all those canals and bridges
and cobbled streets and those churches,</i>

486
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:11,349
<i>all that beautiful fucking fairytale stuff,</i>

487
00:40:11,432 --> 00:40:13,307
<i>how can that not be
somebody's fucking thing, eh?</i>

488
00:40:13,391 --> 00:40:14,724
What I think I meant to say was...

489
00:40:14,807 --> 00:40:16,598
<i>- Is the swan still there?
- Yeah, the swan's...</i>

490
00:40:16,682 --> 00:40:19,765
<i>How can fucking swans not fucking be
somebody's fucking thing, eh?</i>

491
00:40:19,848 --> 00:40:22,182
<i>- How can that be?
- What I think I meant to say was,</i>

492
00:40:22,265 --> 00:40:25,431
when he first arrived,
he wasn't quite sure about it.

493
00:40:25,516 --> 00:40:29,474
You know, there's that big, dual carriageway
when you get off the train?

494
00:40:29,557 --> 00:40:31,808
It mightn't have been here
when you were here last, Harry.

495
00:40:31,891 --> 00:40:34,849
Well, as soon as he got into,
like, the old town proper,

496
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:38,765
and he saw the canals and the bridges
and, you know, the swans and that,

497
00:40:38,848 --> 00:40:40,765
well, he just fucking loved it then.

498
00:40:40,848 --> 00:40:44,391
Couldn't get enough of it,
the medieval part of town.

499
00:40:44,474 --> 00:40:49,099
It was just that initial, dual carriageway
thing sort of put him off for a second.

500
00:40:49,182 --> 00:40:50,848
<i>Don't know
if I remember a dual carriageway.</i>

501
00:40:50,932 --> 00:40:52,267
<i>Must be recent.</i>

502
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:57,015
<i>- Hasn't spoilt it, has it?
- No, no, no, it's just that initial thing.</i>

503
00:40:59,473 --> 00:41:01,181
And you know what?

504
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:04,558
As we were walking through the streets,

505
00:41:04,641 --> 00:41:09,765
there was this sort of freezing fog
hanging over everything,

506
00:41:10,224 --> 00:41:14,014
and it made it look almost like a fairytale
or something.

507
00:41:14,098 --> 00:41:15,599
And he turned to me,
do you know what he said?

508
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:17,266
<i>What'd he say?</i>

509
00:41:17,348 --> 00:41:22,348
<i>He said, "Ken, I know I'm awake,
but I feel like I'm in a dream."</i>

510
00:41:22,431 --> 00:41:25,890
<i>- Yeah? He said that?
- Yeah.</i>

511
00:41:25,974 --> 00:41:31,431
<i>- Meaning, like, in a good dream?
- Yeah. Of course, like in a good dream.</i>

512
00:41:31,516 --> 00:41:34,932
<i>Oh, good. I'm glad he likes it there.</i>

513
00:41:35,015 --> 00:41:36,932
<i>I'm glad we were able
to give him something.</i>

514
00:41:37,015 --> 00:41:40,848
<i>Something good and happy.
Because he wasn't a bad kid, was he?</i>

515
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,015
<i>He wasn't a bad kid, was he?</i>

516
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,138
<i>Listen, take down this address.
Raamstraat 17.</i>

517
00:41:50,222 --> 00:41:53,266
<i>That's "Raam," like "Ram,"
but with an extra "a."</i>

518
00:41:54,265 --> 00:41:57,014
<i>- Raamstraat 17.
- You got that?</i>

519
00:41:57,391 --> 00:41:58,806
Yes, Raamstraat 17.

520
00:41:58,889 --> 00:42:03,098
<i>Good. There'll be a man there
tomorrow morning at 9:00, his name's Yuri.</i>

521
00:42:03,181 --> 00:42:04,890
<i>- Yuri.
- He'll give you the gun.</i>

522
00:42:04,973 --> 00:42:06,848
<i>Ring me on the public phone
at JimmyDriscoll's</i>

523
00:42:06,931 --> 00:42:09,764
<i>about 3:00 or 4:00 tomorrow, after it's done.</i>

524
00:42:10,722 --> 00:42:12,389
After what's done?

525
00:42:13,098 --> 00:42:14,848
<i>Are you being thick?</i>

526
00:42:16,556 --> 00:42:18,264
<i>- No.
- Listen, I like Ray.</i>

527
00:42:18,346 --> 00:42:20,722
<i>He was a good bloke,
but when it all comes down to it, you know,</i>

528
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:23,889
<i>he blew the head off a little fucking kid.
And you brought him in, Ken.</i>

529
00:42:23,973 --> 00:42:27,431
<i>So if the buck don't stop with him,
where does it stop?</i>

530
00:42:32,931 --> 00:42:33,973
<i>Ken?</i>

531
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,514
<i>If the buck don't stop with him,
where does it stop?</i>

532
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:39,598
It stops with me, Harry. That's an easy one.

533
00:42:39,681 --> 00:42:41,765
<i>Look, don't get shirty, Ken.</i>

534
00:42:42,681 --> 00:42:47,598
<i>Listen, I'm just glad that I was able
to do something for the boybefore he went.</i>

535
00:42:47,681 --> 00:42:51,806
<i>- Do what for the boy?
- You know, have him get to see Bruges.</i>

536
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:55,806
<i>I'd like to go to see Bruges again
before I die.</i>

537
00:42:56,598 --> 00:43:00,098
<i>What was it he said again about...
Yeah, "It's like a dream."</i>

538
00:43:01,889 --> 00:43:05,140
<i>"I know I'm awake,
but I feel like I'm in a dream."</i>

539
00:43:07,598 --> 00:43:08,722
<i>Yeah.</i>

540
00:43:10,598 --> 00:43:12,888
<i>Give me a call when he's dead.</i>

541
00:43:34,306 --> 00:43:35,347
(GASPS)

542
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:41,639
- That's my fucking girlfriend, you asshole.
- Eirik, what are you doing?

543
00:43:41,723 --> 00:43:45,013
- Where are you from, fucker?
- Ireland, originally.

544
00:43:45,806 --> 00:43:48,097
And you think it's okay
to come over to Belgium

545
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,930
and fuck another man's girl?

546
00:43:50,013 --> 00:43:51,805
Look, I didn't know
she had a boyfriend, all right?

547
00:43:51,888 --> 00:43:54,847
And I haven't fucked her, anyway. Ask her.
I'd only put me hand on it.

548
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:56,888
Eirik, put the gun down!

549
00:43:58,097 --> 00:44:00,514
Get down on your knees
and open your mouth.

550
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:02,138
Don't start being silly.

551
00:44:02,221 --> 00:44:03,972
Get down on your...

552
00:44:04,888 --> 00:44:08,471
Exactly at what point was it
that all skinheads suddenly became poofs?

553
00:44:08,555 --> 00:44:09,722
Used to be, you were a skinhead,

554
00:44:09,805 --> 00:44:12,054
you just went around
beating up Pakistani 12-year-olds.

555
00:44:12,137 --> 00:44:15,430
Now it seems a prerequisite
to be a fucking bum-boy!

556
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:20,972
- That's not gonna help you, man.
- Ray, there's only blanks in that gun.

557
00:44:27,556 --> 00:44:29,347
Eirik, don't!

558
00:44:29,431 --> 00:44:33,014
- Now who's the fucking bum-boy?
- You, you fucking bum-boy!

559
00:44:33,097 --> 00:44:35,097
(GROANING)

560
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,013
Chloe, what exactly is going on here?

561
00:44:37,097 --> 00:44:39,264
I can't see! I can't see!

562
00:44:39,347 --> 00:44:43,722
Of course you can't fucking see!
I just shot a blank in your fucking eyes!

563
00:44:43,805 --> 00:44:48,722
- Is this fella your boyfriend?
- No. I mean, he used to be.

564
00:44:48,805 --> 00:44:53,430
- Well, what's he doing here?
- We... We rob tourists, sometimes.

565
00:44:53,513 --> 00:44:56,428
I fucking knew it was too good to be true!

566
00:44:56,805 --> 00:44:58,597
I knew you'd have never shagged me,
normally.

567
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,888
No! That's not true, I...

568
00:45:00,972 --> 00:45:04,306
I called it off tonight.
I told him not to come tonight.

569
00:45:04,389 --> 00:45:07,263
- Why did you come tonight?
- EIRIK: Chloe, I can't see, I swear it!

570
00:45:07,345 --> 00:45:11,470
Stop whingeing like a big gay baby.
I haven't had a shag in months!

571
00:45:11,554 --> 00:45:16,555
I can't see out of this eye, Chloe!
I have to go to the hospital!

572
00:45:16,638 --> 00:45:18,345
I'll drive you.

573
00:45:18,429 --> 00:45:21,512
- Great! Now the whole night's ruined!
- No!

574
00:45:21,596 --> 00:45:25,553
You can stay if you want.
I just don't know how long I'll be.

575
00:45:25,637 --> 00:45:28,471
I just knew someone like you
would never like someone like me.

576
00:45:28,555 --> 00:45:31,305
- I just knew.
- What do you mean, someone like me?

577
00:45:31,388 --> 00:45:33,346
You know, someone nice.

578
00:45:40,722 --> 00:45:43,220
Call me. Please.

579
00:45:48,469 --> 00:45:49,762
EIRIK: Chloe!

580
00:46:55,929 --> 00:46:57,262
(MUMBLES)

581
00:47:00,428 --> 00:47:03,928
- Have you got some sort of problem?
- No, no problem.

582
00:47:04,011 --> 00:47:06,761
Four beers in 20 minutes. No problem.

583
00:47:08,678 --> 00:47:09,927
Fuck off.

584
00:47:18,053 --> 00:47:20,178
JIMMY: Beer and a red wine.

585
00:47:20,261 --> 00:47:21,720
I'll be back.

586
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:26,094
How's the movie going?

587
00:47:26,178 --> 00:47:30,303
It's a jumped-up Eurotrash piece
of rip-off fucking bullshit.

588
00:47:30,386 --> 00:47:32,303
Like, in a bad way?

589
00:47:35,804 --> 00:47:37,511
Your girlfriend's very pretty.

590
00:47:37,597 --> 00:47:41,387
She ain't my girlfriend.
She's a prostitute I just picked up.

591
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:45,928
Didn't know there were any prostitutes
in Bruges.

592
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:48,427
You just have to look in the right places.

593
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:50,136
Brothels are good.

594
00:47:51,677 --> 00:47:54,677
Well, you've picked up
a very pretty prostitute.

595
00:47:54,761 --> 00:47:56,095
Thank you.

596
00:48:00,595 --> 00:48:02,343
You from the States?

597
00:48:03,178 --> 00:48:04,303
Yeah.

598
00:48:04,677 --> 00:48:07,595
- But don't hold it against me.
- I'll try not to.

599
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:12,136
Just try not to say anything too loud
or crass.

600
00:48:29,844 --> 00:48:32,219
Hey-ho. Drowning your sorrows, huh?

601
00:48:32,303 --> 00:48:36,011
- What sorrows?
- You know, being a sad, old, ugly little man.

602
00:48:36,094 --> 00:48:38,471
- One gay beer, please.
- How'd your date go?

603
00:48:38,553 --> 00:48:40,761
My date involved two instances
of extreme violence.

604
00:48:40,844 --> 00:48:42,886
One instance of her hand on my cock
and my finger up her thing,

605
00:48:42,969 --> 00:48:45,844
which lasted all too briefly.
Isn't that always the way?

606
00:48:45,927 --> 00:48:49,301
One instance of me stealing five grams
of her very-high-quality cocaine,

607
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:51,553
and one instance of me blinding
a poofy little skinhead.

608
00:48:51,636 --> 00:48:54,802
So, all in all,
my evening pretty much balanced out fine.

609
00:48:54,886 --> 00:48:56,969
You got five grams of coke?

610
00:48:57,761 --> 00:48:59,427
I've got four grams on me
and one gram in me,

611
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:00,802
which is why me heart
is going like the clappers,

612
00:49:00,886 --> 00:49:02,093
as if I'm about to have a heart attack.

613
00:49:02,177 --> 00:49:04,386
So if I collapse any minute now,
please remember to tell the doctors

614
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:06,093
that it might have something
to do with the coke.

615
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:07,594
Give us a gram, then.

616
00:49:07,676 --> 00:49:09,594
I thought you were laying off,
because it makes you depressed?

617
00:49:09,676 --> 00:49:13,094
You know what?
Right now, I don't really give a fuck.

618
00:49:41,261 --> 00:49:44,385
Why didn't you wave hello to me today
when I waved hello to you today?

619
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:47,010
I was on a very strong
horse tranquiliser today.

620
00:49:47,094 --> 00:49:51,969
I wasn't waving hello to anybody,
except maybe to a horse.

621
00:49:52,427 --> 00:49:54,885
Huh? What are you talking about?

622
00:49:54,968 --> 00:49:57,009
Just horseshit.

623
00:49:58,009 --> 00:49:59,760
You from America?

624
00:49:59,843 --> 00:50:02,384
Yeah. But don't hold it against me.

625
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:05,385
Well, that's for me to decide, isn't it?

626
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:08,470
- Are you from America, too?
- No, I'm from Amsterdam.

627

(SCOFFS) Amsterdam.

628
00:50:10,009 --> 00:50:12,843
Amsterdam is just a load
of bloody prostitutes, isn't it?

629
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,926
Yes. That's why I came to Bruges.

630
00:50:15,009 --> 00:50:18,259
I thought I'd get a better price
for my pussy here.

You two are weird.

632
00:50:26,383 --> 00:50:28,510
Would you like some cocaine?

633
00:50:31,052 --> 00:50:33,843
I've also got some acid and some ecstasy.

Would you ever think about it?

Would you ever think about killing yourself
because you're a midget?

642
00:51:07,635 --> 00:51:12,300
- Fuck, man! What kind of question is that?
- We're just chatting, aren't we?

See, Ken, this is the kind of hotel
Harry should have put us in.

doesn't even give a shit about us at all.

I'm fighting with the blacks.

- The blacks.
- What about...

Think of a hard one.

- What about the Vietnamese?
- The blacks!

she was murdered by a white man.

in all this blood and carnage?

There are a lot of alcoves
in the Koningin Astrid Park.

693
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,590
You use this word, "alcoves"?

694
00:56:28,382 --> 00:56:30,630
"Alcoves"? Yes. Sometimes.

695

I would murder him here.

Are you sure
this is the right word, "alcoves"?

698
00:56:44,507 --> 00:56:48,131
<i>"Alcoves," yes.
It's kind of like "nooks and crannies."</i>

699
00:56:48,215 --> 00:56:52,297
"Nooks and crannies," yes.
Perhaps this would be more accurate.

this morning.

Oddly? How?

706
00:57:30,922 --> 00:57:35,048
Well, he asked me about the baby,
and if I wanted a boy or a girl.

707
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,297
I said I didn't mind
as long as it's healthy, of course.

708
00:57:39,381 --> 00:57:43,673
But then he gave me 200 euros
to give to the baby.

709
00:57:45,172 --> 00:57:50,088
I refused, obviously,
but he was quite insistent.

710
00:57:51,922 --> 00:57:55,004
Would you give it back to him
when you see him?

711
00:57:55,714 --> 00:57:59,755
I don't want to appear ungrateful,
but it seemed like all the money he had.

712
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:03,839
- Do you know where he is now?
- He said he was going to the park.

713
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:04,712
Sorry, Ray.

714
00:59:06,628 --> 00:59:08,004
I'm sorry.

716
00:59:39,921 --> 00:59:42,503

Where the fuck did you come from?

717
00:59:42,586 --> 00:59:45,587
I was behind the thing.
What the fuck are you doing, Ray?

718
00:59:45,671 --> 00:59:48,294

- You were gonna kill me.
- No, I wasn't.

You were gonna kill yourself!

723

- I'm allowed to.
- No, you're not!

Can we go somewhere
and talk about this, please?

you were gonna go fucking through with it.

You're a suicide case.

and put you on a train somewhere.

get out of this business
and try to do something good.

You're not gonna help anybody dead.

753

You're not gonna bring that boy back.

754
01:02:23,793 --> 01:02:26,127
But you might save the next one.

755

What am I gonna be, a doctor?

756

You need exams.

757
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,546
Do anything, Ray. Do anything.

Not only have you refused to kill the boy,

from killing himself,

accidentally or otherwise,

I wouldn't have thought twice.

892
01:14:32,454 --> 01:14:34,997
I'd have killed myself on the fucking spot.
On the fucking spot.

893
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,704
I'd have stuck the gun in me mouth
on the fucking spot!

That's you, Harry.

until she's left the hotel.

1071
01:34:01,818 --> 01:34:05,235
I swear not to start shooting
till she's left the hotel. I totally swear.

1072
01:34:05,317 --> 01:34:07,733
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

1073
01:34:07,817 --> 01:34:09,983
This is my hotel.

1074
01:34:10,067 --> 01:34:11,817
So you can fuck off!

1075
01:34:24,441 --> 01:34:27,317
- I suppose you've got a gun up there?
- Yeah.

1076
01:34:28,526 --> 01:34:31,234
Then what are we gonna do?
We can't stand here all night.

1077
01:34:31,316 --> 01:34:34,401
Why don't you both put your guns down
and go home?

1078
01:34:34,483 --> 01:34:37,526
Don't be stupid. This is the shootout.

1079
01:34:39,192 --> 01:34:42,275
- Harry, I've got an idea.
- What?

1080
01:34:42,358 --> 01:34:44,567
My room faces onto the canal, right?

1081
01:34:44,650 --> 01:34:47,359
I'm gonna go back to me room,
jump into the canal,

1082
01:34:47,442 --> 01:34:49,525
see if I can swim to the other side
and escape.

1083
01:34:49,608 --> 01:34:51,817
- Right.
- If you go outside and round the corner,

1084
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:54,233
you can shoot at me from there
and try and get me.

1085
01:34:54,315 --> 01:34:56,775
That way, we leave this lady and her baby
out of the whole, entire thing.

1086
01:34:56,857 --> 01:34:59,192
Do you completely promise
to jump into the canal?

1087
01:34:59,276 --> 01:35:01,066
I don't want to run out there,
come back in 10 minutes

1088
01:35:01,150 --> 01:35:02,692
and find you fucking hiding in a cupboard.

1089
01:35:02,775 --> 01:35:04,067
I completely promise, Harry.

1090
01:35:04,150 --> 01:35:06,441
I'm not gonna risk
having another little kid die, am I?

1091
01:35:06,524 --> 01:35:10,691
So, hang on, I go outside,
then I go which way, right or left?

1092
01:35:10,774 --> 01:35:12,233
You go right, don't you?

1093
01:35:12,315 --> 01:35:15,274
You can see it from the doorway!
It's a big fucking canal!

1094
01:35:15,357 --> 01:35:18,315
All right. Jesus!
I've only just got here, haven't I?

1095
01:35:18,399 --> 01:35:21,234
Okay.
On a count of "one, two, three, go," okay?

1096
01:35:21,316 --> 01:35:22,442
Okay.

1097
01:35:28,358 --> 01:35:31,108
- What? Who says it?
- Oh, you say it.

1098
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:33,108
You guys are crazy.

1099
01:35:33,191 --> 01:35:34,567
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

1100
01:35:34,651 --> 01:35:36,191
- Set?
- Set.

1101
01:35:36,275 --> 01:35:38,066
One, two, three, go!

1102
01:35:52,109 --> 01:35:53,566
Keep driving!

1103
01:36:00,608 --> 01:36:02,983
No way. You're way too far away.

1104
01:36:08,441 --> 01:36:10,065
(GROANING)

1105
01:38:05,565 --> 01:38:08,523
- The little boy.
- That's right, Ray.

1106
01:38:09,647 --> 01:38:11,233
The little boy.

1107
01:39:20,187 --> 01:39:21,355
I see.

1108
01:39:28,024 --> 01:39:29,648
No, Harry.

1109
01:39:30,648 --> 01:39:32,188
He's not...

1110
01:39:34,814 --> 01:39:37,441
You've got to stick to your principles.

1111
01:40:03,813 --> 01:40:05,563
<i>RAY: There's a Christmas tree
somewhere in London</i>

1112
01:40:05,646 --> 01:40:09,522
<i>with a bunch of presents underneath it
that'll never be opened.</i>

1113
01:40:10,188 --> 01:40:14,187
<i>And I thought, "If I survive all this,
I'll go to that house,</i>

1114
01:40:14,272 --> 01:40:16,023
<i>"apologise to the mother there,</i>

1115
01:40:16,106 --> 01:40:19,521
<i>"and accept whatever punishment
she chose for me."</i>

1116
01:40:19,605 --> 01:40:22,939
<i>Prison, death, it didn't matter.</i>

1117
01:40:24,270 --> 01:40:27,565
<i>Because at least in prison
and at least in death, you know,</i>

1118
01:40:27,647 --> 01:40:30,023
<i>I wouldn't be in fucking Bruges.</i>

1119
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:36,521
<i>But then, like a flash, it came to me,
and I realised,</i>

1120
01:40:38,854 --> 01:40:41,480
<i>"Fuck, man, maybe that's what Hell is.</i>

1121
01:40:43,062 --> 01:40:46,354
<i>"The entire rest of eternity
spent in fucking Bruges!"</i>

1122
01:40:51,231 --> 01:40:54,062
<i>And I really, really hoped I wouldn't die.</i>

1123
01:40:56,688 --> 01:40:59,271
<i>I really, really hoped I wouldn't die.</i>
