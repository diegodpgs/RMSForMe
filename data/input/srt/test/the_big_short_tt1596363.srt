Hiya, Frank. How are the wife and kids?

3
00:01:23,248 --> 00:01:24,547
You know, for you, I'm considering

4
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:28,318
treasury bonds and utility stocks. Smoke?

5
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,487
<i>In the late '70s,
banking wasn't a job</i>

6
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:32,991
<i>you went into to make
large sums of money.</i>

7
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:35,692
<i>It was a fucking snooze.</i>

8
00:01:35,694 --> 00:01:37,594
How about those Mets?

9
00:01:37,596 --> 00:01:40,330
<i>Filled with losers. Like
selling insurance or</i>

10
00:01:40,332 --> 00:01:41,764
accounting.

11
00:01:41,766 --> 00:01:43,234
And if banking was boring,

12
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,671
then the bond department at the
bank was straight-up comatose.

13
00:01:46,504 --> 00:01:47,970
<i>We all know about bonds.</i>

14
00:01:47,972 --> 00:01:50,139
<i>You give them to your
snot-nosed kid when he turns 15.</i>

15
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:52,208
Maybe when he's 30 he
makes a hundred bucks.

16
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,610
Boring.

17
00:01:53,612 --> 00:01:55,478
That is, until Lewis
Ranieri came on the scene

18
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,515
at Salomon Brothers.

19
00:02:02,487 --> 00:02:04,788
You might not know who he
is, but he changed your life

20
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,591
<i>more than Michael Jordan, the
iPod and YouTube put together.</i>

21
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:12,228
All right, gentlemen! Let's
get some money in here!

22
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,833
Let's make some money! What do you say?

23
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:17,733
<i>You see, Lewis didn't know it yet,</i>

24
00:02:17,735 --> 00:02:19,735
<i>but he had already
changed banking forever</i>

25
00:02:19,737 --> 00:02:21,738
<i>with one simple idea.</i>

26
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:27,244
The mortgage-backed security.
Or private-label MBS.

27
00:02:27,246 --> 00:02:29,179
You've got your average person's mortgage.

28
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:30,680
Fixed rate, 30 years.

29
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:34,019
Boring, safe, small payoff, right? But,

30
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,088
when you have thousands of
them all bundled together,

31
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,725
suddenly the yield goes up but
the risk is still small because,

32
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:42,792
well, they're mortgages!

33
00:02:42,794 --> 00:02:44,294
And who the hell doesn't
pay their mortgage?

34
00:02:44,296 --> 00:02:46,729
What exactly is the
credit rating on this bond?

35
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:50,132
This bond, gentlemen, is AAA-rated.

36
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:51,535
This is exactly what the Michigan state

37
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:53,335
pension fund has been looking for.

38
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:54,905
I'll buy $20 million.

39
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:56,207
Oh, come on, live a little.

40
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,907
$25 million.

41
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:00,943
<i>The money came raining down,</i>

42
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:02,546
<i>and for the first time,</i>

43
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:05,318
<i>the banker went from the
country club to the strip club.</i>

44
00:03:07,953 --> 00:03:11,322
<i>Pretty soon, stocks and savings
were almost inconsequential.</i>

45
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,590
- <i>They were doing $50, $100, $200 billion</i>
- Whoo!

46
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:15,024
<i>in mortgage bonds
and dozens of other</i>

47
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:17,563
<i>securities a year.</i>

48
00:03:25,837 --> 00:03:28,239
<i>And America barely noticed
as its number one industry</i>

49
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,310
<i>became boring old banking.</i>

50
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:37,483
<i>And then one day, almost
30 years later, in 2008,</i>

51
00:03:38,683 --> 00:03:40,453
<i>it all came crashing down.</i>

52
00:03:43,588 --> 00:03:46,423
<i>March. Bear Stearns
was in a death spiral</i>

53
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:48,124
<i>and the Fed brokered its sale.</i>

54
00:03:48,126 --> 00:03:51,294
<i>It's been called the worst
financial crisis in modern times.</i>

55
00:03:51,296 --> 00:03:55,631
<i>Certainly the largest financial
disaster in decades in this country,</i>

56
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:58,768
<i>and perhaps the end of an
era in American business.</i>

57
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,103
<i>In the end, Lewis Ranieri's
mortgage-backed security</i>

58
00:04:01,105 --> 00:04:02,905
<i>mutated into a monstrosity that</i>

59
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:05,241
<i>collapsed the whole world economy.</i>

60
00:04:05,243 --> 00:04:07,278
<i>And none of the experts or
leaders or talking heads</i>

61
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,548
<i>had a clue it was coming.</i>

62
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:13,517
<i>I'm guessing most of you still
don't really know what happened.</i>

63
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,984
<i>Yeah, you got a soundbite you repeat</i>

64
00:04:14,986 --> 00:04:16,385
<i>so you don't sound
dumb, but come on.</i>

65
00:04:16,387 --> 00:04:18,824
Our financial institutions are strong.

66
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:22,591
<i>But there were some
who saw it coming.</i>

67
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:24,728
<i>While the whole world was
having a big old party,</i>

68
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,065
<i>a few outsiders and weirdos
saw what no one else could.</i>

69
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:31,735
<i>Not me. I'm not a weirdo.
I'm pretty fucking cool.</i>

70
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:34,238
<i>But we'll meet again later.</i>

71
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,074
<i>These outsiders saw the giant
lie at the heart of the economy.</i>

72
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:38,575
<i>And they saw it by doing something</i>

73
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:41,380
<i>the rest of the suckers
never thought to do.</i>

74
00:04:42,314 --> 00:04:43,650
<i>They looked.</i>

75
00:04:56,461 --> 00:04:58,798
<i>During the 1930s,</i>

76
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:05,071
the housing market collapsed nationwide

77
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:08,673
by roughly 80%.

78
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:13,877
I mean, half of all
mortgage debt was in default.

79
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:16,549
And, I mean, there were very

80
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:21,187
specific identifiers,
extremely recognizable.

81
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:25,255
I mean, for instance,

82
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:28,824
one of the hallmarks of mania

83
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:30,260
is the rapid rise

84
00:05:30,262 --> 00:05:32,396
in complexity and the rates of fraud.

85
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:36,365
And did you know that they're going up?

86
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,673
Whoo!

87
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,320
<i>I've always been</i>

88
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:59,456
<i>more comfortable alone.</i>

89
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:11,269
<i>I believe maybe it's
because of my glass eye.</i>

90
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,475
<i>I lost the eye in a
childhood illness.</i>

91
00:06:20,812 --> 00:06:23,149
<i>It separates me from people.</i>

92
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:29,652
<i>And did you know that they are going</i>

93
00:06:29,654 --> 00:06:30,853
up?

94
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:34,457
The highest fraud rates since the 1930s.

95
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:36,860
Hey, hey, it's okay. It's okay.

96
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:39,932
No, I didn't know that.

97
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:47,370
In 1933, the fourth year
of the Great Depression.

98
00:06:47,372 --> 00:06:49,139
Let's wash it off and put it back in.

99
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:51,207
You were playing so great, son.

100
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:53,245
I even heard the coach say it.

101
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:56,747
Can we just go home?

102
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,983
<i>Most social interactions are
awkward for me and for the person.</i>

103
00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:04,586
<i>Even when I try to
compliment someone,</i>

104
00:07:04,588 --> 00:07:06,856
<i>it comes out wrong.</i>

105
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:10,860
You have a very nice haircut.
Did you do it yourself?

106
00:07:10,862 --> 00:07:12,628
What?

107
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,133
No. No, I...

108
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,610
I'm sorry. I'm just...

109
00:07:31,315 --> 00:07:32,582
I'm going on and on.

110
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:34,317
My wife told me I need to share more.

111
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,321
Mmm.

112
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:38,187
- That seems healthy.
- Yeah.

113
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:39,192
Mmm-hmm.

114
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:49,701
Uh...

115
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,401
So do I get the job?

116
00:07:52,403 --> 00:07:54,740
I really think I could help your fund.

117
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:57,574
Yeah.

118
00:07:57,576 --> 00:07:59,212
Yeah, sure. Go on.

119
00:08:01,913 --> 00:08:03,613
You're...

120
00:08:03,615 --> 00:08:05,248
David. Great.

121
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,183
I guess I'll go find a desk.

122
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:09,754
Is there anything you want
me to work on for start...

123
00:08:10,254 --> 00:08:11,257
Uh...

124
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:14,257
Yeah.

125
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:16,259
You could let me know
later. I could come back.

126
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:23,332
Did you think it was strange when, um,

127
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:25,901
the tech bubble burst in 2001

128
00:08:25,903 --> 00:08:28,771
and the housing market in San Jose,

129
00:08:28,773 --> 00:08:30,977
the tech capital of the world,

130
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:34,344
went up?

131
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:35,445
Wasn't that strange?

132
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:36,513
No.

133
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:39,181
No, it's housing. Housing is always stable.

134
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:40,282
Low risk. It's solid.

135
00:08:40,284 --> 00:08:42,352
That's the idea, yeah.

136
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:44,186
I want you to get me

137
00:08:44,188 --> 00:08:47,456
the top 20 selling mortgage bonds.

138
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,393
So you want to know what the top
20 selling mortgage bonds are?

139
00:08:50,395 --> 00:08:56,132
No, no, no, I want to know
what mortgages are in each one.

140
00:08:56,134 --> 00:08:59,169
Okay, aren't those mortgages made up of...

141
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,737
Wait, aren't those bonds made up

142
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:02,873
of thousands and thousands of mortgages?

143
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,309
Yeah.

144
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:09,881
Right away, Dr. Burry.

145
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:33,337
I am a nice guy all day long.

146
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,008
Ask anyone, I'm a pleasure to work with.

147
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:42,945
But the second my son screws up, I am...

148
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:45,451
...yelling at him just
like my dad did to me.

149
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:51,588
I hear the words that are
coming out of my mouth and...

150
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,360
Sorry I'm late! No cabs.

151
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:56,061
Oh...

152
00:09:56,528 --> 00:09:58,862
So, get this.

153
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,632
I met with this retail banker yesterday.

154
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,133
I'm supposed to be getting
him to invest in a fund,

155
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:05,536
but instead

156
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,504
I start grilling him
about overdraft penalties

157
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:11,574
and how his bank will let a
customer write 10-12 checks

158
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:13,243
before they tell them they're overdrawn.

159
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:16,945
And this creep is making billions
off screwing over people this way.

160
00:10:16,947 --> 00:10:18,815
And I'm getting madder and madder.

161
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:22,285
And I ask him, I look
him in the face and I say,

162
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:24,587
"How can you sleep at night

163
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:28,156
"knowing that you are
ripping off working people?"

164
00:10:28,158 --> 00:10:29,925
And you know what he did? He left.

165
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:32,728
He just walks out of the
lunch, doesn't say a word.

166
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,829
What the fuck is that?

167
00:10:33,831 --> 00:10:36,233
Who's fucked up in that scenario? Am I?

168
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,767
Or is this douchebag,
who leaves me hanging?

169
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:40,137
Is he the fucked up one?

170
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,006
We have talked about this numerous times.

171
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:46,209
You can't come in late and
hijack the entire session.

172
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:47,743
What do you mean? I
didn't hijack the meeting.

173
00:10:47,745 --> 00:10:48,978
Did I hijack the session?

174
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,081
Yeah.

175
00:10:50,548 --> 00:10:51,848
What do you do?

176
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,081
I'm in commodities.

177
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,483
Good luck with that.

178
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:58,155
Mark, I know you suffered a terrible loss.

179
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,656
Maybe you want to talk about that.

180
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:00,757
I don't talk about that.

181
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,258
Hold on.

182
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,694
Hold on...

183
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:07,430
Shit, I have to take this. Sorry. Sorry.

184
00:11:07,432 --> 00:11:09,632
No... I don't care, Porter.

185
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:11,334
This guy's whole business is
built on ripping people off.

186
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:12,904
How long can that last?

187
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:15,541
Bye, everybody!

188
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,541
95...

189
00:11:18,543 --> 00:11:20,645
That's 30 days late... Sixty days late...

190
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,681
They pay on time...

191
00:11:28,486 --> 00:11:30,121
These FICO scores...

192
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,927
<i>Late. And they caught
up on their payments...</i>

193
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:40,530
<i>Another 30 days late...</i>

194
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:43,866
<i>LTV, 95... LTV, 90... They
caught up on their payments...</i>

195
00:11:43,868 --> 00:11:45,469
<i>Sixty days late? Jesus!</i>

196
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,671
<i>LTV, 110? I've never heard of that!</i>

197
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,008
<i>Thirty days late, rate adjusts...</i>

198
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,340
<i>In '07 rate adjusts...</i>

199
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:52,642
<i>In '06 rate adjusts...</i>

200
00:11:52,644 --> 00:11:55,012
<i>95... 90... Jesus!</i>

201
00:11:56,581 --> 00:11:58,314
He hasn't moved all day.

202
00:11:58,316 --> 00:12:00,717
He does this every few days.

203
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,484
He hasn't spoken to me since he hired me.

204
00:12:02,486 --> 00:12:03,987
<i>Maybe the LTV's at... High-risk,</i>

205
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,289
<i>interest-only... I never heard
of that mortgage history,</i>

206
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,124
<i>I never heard of that... How?</i>

207
00:12:09,126 --> 00:12:10,526
Michael, how are you, guy?

208
00:12:10,528 --> 00:12:13,629
<i>Lawrence, I found something
really interesting.</i>

209
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:15,632
Great, Michael. Whenever you
find something interesting,

210
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:16,932
<i>we all tend to make money.</i>

211
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:18,434
<i>What stock are you valuing?</i>

212
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:19,868
No, no, no, no. No stocks.

213
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,238
I want to short the housing market.

214
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:26,475
Really? But the housing
market is rock solid.

215
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:27,978
<i>Greenspan just said</i>

216
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,647
<i>bubbles are regional,
defaults are rare.</i>

217
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,882
Tell them I'll be there in a minute.

218
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:34,751
- Say again?
- <i>Look, look...</i>

219
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,685
Greenspan's wrong.

220
00:12:36,687 --> 00:12:40,156
<i>I don't think you mean to do
this, but sometimes you sound very</i>

221
00:12:40,158 --> 00:12:42,559
dismissive and superior.

222
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:43,792
It's a fact. Greenspan's wrong.

223
00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:46,229
I don't know how else you want me to say...

224
00:12:46,231 --> 00:12:47,698
Look, Michael.

225
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,398
Metro Capital backed you four years ago

226
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,267
<i>when you were a doctor with a</i>

227
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:53,670
dinky webpage and some inheritance money.

228
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:54,771
<i>We've all done very well.</i>

229
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,039
Why don't you just stick with stocks?

230
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,241
<i>Look. You know me. I, I, I...</i>

231
00:12:58,243 --> 00:13:02,078
I look for value wherever it can be found.

232
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,280
And the fact is

233
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,583
that these mortgage-backed
securities are filled

234
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:10,085
<i>with extremely risky subprime
adjustable-rate loans.</i>

235
00:13:10,087 --> 00:13:12,689
<i>And when the majority
of the adjustable rates</i>

236
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,090
<i>kick in, in '07,</i>

237
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:16,359
they will begin to fail.

238
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:19,762
And if they fail above 15%,
the whole bond is worthless.

239
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:22,031
<i>Michael, just take a beat.</i>

240
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:23,333
<i>We'll talk about this later, okay?</i>

241
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,435
Lawrence, please, don't
patronize me. Listen...

242
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:28,004
<i>Mortgage-backed securities.</i>

243
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:29,406
It, it, it...

244
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,273
<i>Subprime loans. Tranches.</i>

245
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:33,041
<i>It's pretty confusing, right?</i>

246
00:13:33,043 --> 00:13:35,744
<i>Does it make you feel
bored? Or stupid?</i>

247
00:13:35,746 --> 00:13:38,114
<i>Well, it's supposed to.</i>

248
00:13:38,116 --> 00:13:39,782
<i>Wall Street loves to
use confusing terms</i>

249
00:13:39,784 --> 00:13:42,819
<i>to make you think only
they can do what they do.</i>

250
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,087
<i>Or, even better,</i>

251
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,556
<i>for you to just leave
them the fuck alone.</i>

252
00:13:46,558 --> 00:13:49,759
<i>So here's Margot Robbie in
a bubble bath to explain.</i>

253
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:52,863
Basically, Lewis Ranieri's mortgage bonds

254
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,230
were amazingly profitable
for the big banks.

255
00:13:55,232 --> 00:13:59,268
They made billions and
billions on their 2% fee

256
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,570
they got for selling each of these bonds.

257
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:03,440
But then they started
running out of mortgages

258
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,074
to put in them.

259
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:07,810
After all, there are only so many homes

260
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:09,646
and so many people with good enough jobs

261
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,680
to buy them, right?

262
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:13,849
So the banks started filling these bonds

263
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:16,084
with riskier and riskier mortgages.

264
00:14:16,086 --> 00:14:17,587
Thank you, Benter.

265
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:21,959
That way they can keep that
profit machine churning, right?

266
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:26,430
By the way, these risky
mortgages are called subprime.

267
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,897
So whenever you hear "subprime", think

268
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:30,434
"shit".

269
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:34,070
Our friend Michael Burry found
out that these mortgage bonds

270
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:37,373
that were supposedly 65% AAA

271
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,709
were actually just mostly full of shit.

272
00:14:40,711 --> 00:14:43,546
So now he's going to "short" the bonds.

273
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:45,550
Which means to "bet against".

274
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:47,418
Got it?

275
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,388
Good.

276
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:53,823
Now fuck off.

277
00:14:53,825 --> 00:14:55,090
It's only a matter of time before

278
00:14:55,092 --> 00:14:56,258
someone else sees this investment.

279
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,026
We have to act now!

280
00:14:58,028 --> 00:15:00,363
How do you know the bonds are worthless?

281
00:15:00,365 --> 00:15:02,665
Aren't they filled with fucking thousands

282
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:03,866
<i>of pages of mortgages?</i>

283
00:15:03,868 --> 00:15:06,234
I read them.

284
00:15:06,236 --> 00:15:08,204
- <i>You read them?</i>
- I read... Yes.

285
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:09,906
No one reads them. Only the lawyers

286
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:11,507
who put them together read them.

287
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:16,345
Look, I don't think that they
even know what they've made.

288
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:19,882
The housing market is propped up on these

289
00:15:19,884 --> 00:15:22,651
bad loans, and I'm...

290
00:15:22,653 --> 00:15:24,787
It's a time bomb, and I want to short it.

291
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:27,156
Through what instrument, Michael?

292
00:15:27,158 --> 00:15:30,227
There are no insurance contracts
or options for mortgage bonds.

293
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,627
The bonds are too stable.

294
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:32,898
Lawrence...

295
00:15:36,234 --> 00:15:40,403
This is what I'm gonna
do. I am gonna get a bank

296
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:42,473
to make me one.

297
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,743
And then

298
00:15:45,576 --> 00:15:47,544
I'm gonna buy it.

299
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:50,546
I don't want that kind of business.

300
00:15:50,548 --> 00:15:53,217
Money is not money. That's bad money.

301
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:56,120
Hey! Excuse me!

302
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,488
Let me ask you this. What
company treats its customers

303
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,959
that shittily and succeeds?

304
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:05,862
Fine. Okay, Goldman. You're right.

305
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,296
<i>Mark Baum had built his career</i>

306
00:16:07,298 --> 00:16:09,398
<i>on never assuming
anyone or any company</i>

307
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,166
<i>was legit without proving it.</i>

308
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:12,734
<i>When he was a kid he
excelled at studying</i>

309
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:14,871
<i>the Talmud in Yeshiva. Whatever.</i>

310
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,839
<i>But one day his rabbi
told his mom why.</i>

311
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:21,076
Paul is a fine boy, and
Mark is an excellent student

312
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:23,746
of the Torah and the Talmud.

313
00:16:23,748 --> 00:16:25,781
Then what's the problem, rabbi?

314
00:16:25,783 --> 00:16:29,786
It's the reason Mark is studying so hard.

315
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,991
He's looking for inconsistencies
in the word of God!

316
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:38,962
So has he found any?

317
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:42,331
<i>Later, Baum started his
own fund on Wall Street.</i>

318
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,800
<i>He had an amazing nose for bullshit.</i>

319
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:45,901
<i>And he wasn't afraid to let
anyone know when and where</i>

320
00:16:45,903 --> 00:16:48,604
<i>the bull had gone number two.</i>

321
00:16:48,606 --> 00:16:50,339
<i>But then a tragedy happened to Mark,</i>

322
00:16:50,341 --> 00:16:51,874
<i>and it turned his world view dark</i>

323
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:54,276
<i>and ready to believe the
whole system was a lie.</i>

324
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:55,911
Hold on.

325
00:16:55,913 --> 00:16:58,750
It's Cynthia. I'll be in
the office in 20 minutes.

326
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:00,949
Hi, honey.

327
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:06,422
The therapist called. You did it again.

328
00:17:06,424 --> 00:17:09,257
There were no cabs. What
was I supposed to do?

329
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:10,994
I worry about you, Mark.

330
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,331
<i>At least I went.</i>

331
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,664
You're running around
like you have to right

332
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,633
- every wrong in the world.
- Okay.

333
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:18,901
<i>You're so angry.</i>

334
00:17:18,903 --> 00:17:20,402
Fine. You know what?

335
00:17:20,404 --> 00:17:23,405
<i>I'm a mean guy and I'm pissed off.</i>

336
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:25,408
But it is a shit storm out here, sweetie.

337
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:28,778
You have no idea the kind
of crap people are pulling.

338
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,546
And everyone's walking around like
they're in a goddamn Enya video.

339
00:17:33,151 --> 00:17:34,718
They're all getting screwed, you know.

340
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,353
You know what they care about?
They care about the ballgame.

341
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:40,323
Or they care about what
actress just went into rehab.

342
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,458
I think you should try medication.

343
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,728
No, no. We agreed. If
it interfered with work.

344
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,064
You hate Wall Street.
Maybe it's time to quit.

345
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:50,099
- I love my job.
- You hate your job.

346
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:51,167
I love my job.

347
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:52,235
You're miserable.

348
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,239
I love my job. I love my job, honey.

349
00:17:55,173 --> 00:17:56,474
Mark...

350
00:17:57,674 --> 00:18:00,843
I am sad every day about what happened.

351
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:04,182
<i>I know you must feel the
same, but you never show it.</i>

352
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:12,957
I know how close you were to your brother.

353
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:17,395
<i>Paul.</i>

354
00:18:18,462 --> 00:18:20,065
<i>Where'd you go, Paul?</i>

355
00:18:25,336 --> 00:18:26,605
<i>Paul!</i>

356
00:18:32,243 --> 00:18:35,311
Every day I think you're gonna
talk about it, but you never do.

357
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:42,718
Will you at least think about
the idea of making a change?

358
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,653
<i>Fine. Fine. Honey, you know
what? I will consider it.</i>

359
00:18:45,655 --> 00:18:49,124
But, honestly, Cynthia.
I'm okay. I really am.

360
00:18:49,126 --> 00:18:51,160
Hey, hey, hey! No, no.

361
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:54,631
My cab. That's my cab.
That's my cab. That is my cab.

362
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,265
- <i>Schmuck. Fuck you.</i>
- <i>Fuck you.</i>

363
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:57,866
- <i>Fuck you.</i>
- <i>Fuck you.</i>

364
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,471
I'll call you later.

365
00:19:07,845 --> 00:19:12,015
I want to buy swaps on mortgage bonds.

366
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,353
A credit default swap that will pay off

367
00:19:15,385 --> 00:19:18,720
if the underlying bond fails.

368
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:20,323
You want to bet against the housing market?

369
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,357
- Yes.
- Why?

370
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,593
Those bonds only fail

371
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:26,161
if millions of Americans
don't pay their mortgages.

372
00:19:26,163 --> 00:19:28,631
That's never happened in history.

373
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:30,165
If you'll excuse me, Dr. Burry,

374
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:31,633
it seems like a foolish investment.

375
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:34,504
Well, based on prevailing sentiment

376
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,605
of the market and banks in popular culture,

377
00:19:36,607 --> 00:19:38,975
yes, it's a foolish investment.

378
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,611
But, uh... Everyone's wrong.

379
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,582
That's a good one.

380
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:48,651
This is Wall Street, Dr. Burry.

381
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:50,719
If you offer us free money,
we are going to take it.

382
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:55,326
My one concern is that when the bonds fail,

383
00:19:56,461 --> 00:20:00,095
uh, I want to be certain, um, of payment

384
00:20:00,097 --> 00:20:02,834
um, in case of solvency
issues with your bank.

385
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:06,302
I'm sorry, are you for real?

386
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:08,036
You wanna bet against the housing market

387
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:09,439
and you're worried we won't pay you?

388
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,009
Yes, that's correct.

389
00:20:22,353 --> 00:20:24,353
...unless the market crashes.

390
00:20:24,355 --> 00:20:26,655
The market on housing's never gonna crash

391
00:20:26,657 --> 00:20:29,558
because it's so solid right now.

392
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,297
I mean, who doesn't pay their mortgages?

393
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:37,235
Mmm-hmm.

394
00:20:39,503 --> 00:20:40,636
Dr. Burry,

395
00:20:40,638 --> 00:20:43,038
we could work out a
pay-as-we-go structure

396
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,141
that would pay out if the bonds fail.

397
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,709
But it would also apply to your payments

398
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:48,777
if the value of the mortgage bond goes up.

399
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:51,581
You'd have to pay us monthly premiums.

400
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,286
Is that acceptable, Dr. Burry?

401
00:20:56,721 --> 00:20:58,955
Yes. Yes.

402
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:02,290
Um, I have prospectuses
on six mortgage-backed

403
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:04,462
securities I want to short.

404
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:11,333
Majority of the mortgages...

405
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,581
I don't see us losing
any money on these at all.

406
00:21:37,994 --> 00:21:40,729
Dr. Burry, these should be fine.

407
00:21:40,731 --> 00:21:42,731
Yeah. We're prepared to sell you $5 million

408
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:44,602
in credit default swaps
on these mortgage bonds.

409
00:21:45,836 --> 00:21:47,239
Can we make it $100 million?

410
00:21:50,107 --> 00:21:52,510
Uh, absolutely, we can
make it $100 million.

411
00:21:54,077 --> 00:21:57,281
We'll be in touch, send
some paperwork over.

412
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,151
Um...

413
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,717
I like these cups.

414
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:03,451
Can I take one for my son?

415
00:22:03,453 --> 00:22:05,321
Have... Yes. Yes.

416
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:06,890
Thank you.

417
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,259
Have two.

418
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:31,249
Is there any way to do $200 million?

419
00:22:32,717 --> 00:22:35,320
I mean, we can. But are you sure?

420
00:22:36,253 --> 00:22:39,423
Absolutely. Absolutely, we can do that.

421
00:22:53,136 --> 00:22:56,605
We do different projects. We do gardening.

422
00:22:56,607 --> 00:22:58,309
The bonds I'd like to bet against.

423
00:23:00,077 --> 00:23:01,643
It's not bad seeing
yourself on the big screen.

424
00:23:01,645 --> 00:23:03,680
It's very cool.

425
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:07,449
<i>I ordered the 24-ounce
T-bone, which was choice.</i>

426
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:08,984
- <i>I went for volume...</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

427
00:23:08,986 --> 00:23:10,687
<i>...rather than prime.</i>

428
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:13,358
I went for subprime, and the gist was...

429
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,833
Can I have like, lettuce,
tomato, no onions?

430
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:27,236
So, no onions. Lettuce,
tomato, Thousand Island okay?

431
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:28,240
Yeah.

432
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:37,078
Hey, Randall! What's with the Dom?

433
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,015
Bonuses aren't for three months.

434
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:43,085
We just sold $200 million in
credit swaps for mortgage bonds.

435
00:23:43,087 --> 00:23:45,354
Some fund manager from California.

436
00:23:45,356 --> 00:23:46,788
It's fucking crazy, right?

437
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,989
A whole new way to make money, Doug.

438
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:50,293
Wait, wait. I didn't know
there were swaps on mortgages.

439
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,960
There are now. We made it for him.

440
00:23:52,962 --> 00:23:54,697
He must have gone off
his Zoloft or something.

441
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:56,132
I don't know.

442
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:57,967
- Want to join? No?
- Just a second.

443
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,134
Oh...

444
00:23:59,136 --> 00:24:00,635
Hey, Jared.

445
00:24:00,637 --> 00:24:02,171
Did you hear about the
deal that Randall just did

446
00:24:02,173 --> 00:24:03,472
with some fund manager?

447
00:24:03,474 --> 00:24:05,708
Randall? Bullshit.

448
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,642
He's a foot soldier. I'm
sure it's a shit deal.

449
00:24:07,644 --> 00:24:08,879
No, it's for real.

450
00:24:10,114 --> 00:24:11,580
I told you we'd meet later.

451
00:24:11,582 --> 00:24:14,115
Unfortunately, it's in a place
like this which I would never be.

452
00:24:14,117 --> 00:24:16,852
I never hung out with these
idiots after work, ever.

453
00:24:16,854 --> 00:24:19,055
I had fashion friends.

454
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:22,490
Apparently, this guy wanted
$200 mil in credit default swaps.

455
00:24:22,492 --> 00:24:24,326
Randall made the sale. Can you believe it?

456
00:24:24,328 --> 00:24:26,629
Somebody shorted $200
mil on mortgage bonds?

457
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:30,035
That was just with Deutsche.
Word is he hit half the town.

458
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:32,101
How much in total?

459
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:33,902
$1.3 billion.

460
00:24:33,904 --> 00:24:37,840
<i>What? That's pretty much
all of Scion's liquidity.</i>

461
00:24:37,842 --> 00:24:40,008
Michael, this is highly distressing.

462
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,509
<i>Lawrence, that is not</i>

463
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:44,145
all of our liquidity.

464
00:24:44,147 --> 00:24:45,413
And I'm not certain

465
00:24:45,415 --> 00:24:47,749
<i>that you really
understand this trade.</i>

466
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:48,883
This is a certainty.

467
00:24:48,885 --> 00:24:52,054
<i>Mike, I consider
myself a mentor to you.</i>

468
00:24:52,056 --> 00:24:54,023
<i>But our company is not comfortable</i>

469
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:55,958
<i>with this investment.
Am I being clear?</i>

470
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,294
Lawrence, I have full autonomy

471
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:01,296
when it comes to investment strategy.

472
00:25:01,298 --> 00:25:02,530
You can read our agreement.

473
00:25:02,532 --> 00:25:05,933
<i>Do not throw our inception
agreement in my face, Michael.</i>

474
00:25:05,935 --> 00:25:07,536
<i>We had an underlying</i>

475
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:09,771
<i>understanding you wouldn't
act like a goddamn crazy man.</i>

476
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:11,440
This is not crazy.

477
00:25:11,442 --> 00:25:13,007
It's all very logical.

478
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:15,777
<i>So, now we pay up
premiums on these swaps</i>

479
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:18,613
against the housing market
until the mortgages fail?

480
00:25:18,615 --> 00:25:20,415
In other words, we lose millions

481
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:23,087
<i>until something that's never
happened before happens?</i>

482
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:27,959
That's correct.

483
00:26:01,491 --> 00:26:02,824
Hello, Mark Baum.

484
00:26:02,826 --> 00:26:04,994
Oh, hey, Kathy, you busted me.

485
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:06,061
I had a personal thing this afternoon.

486
00:26:06,063 --> 00:26:07,263
I'm not your babysitter.

487
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:09,832
If FrontPoint makes money
for Morgan Stanley, I'm happy.

488
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:12,235
Okay. Hey, did I hear you're expecting?

489
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,669
We're expecting to be expecting.

490
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:15,438
IVF's are cleaning us out
but we're staying positive...

491
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,942
That's exciting!

492
00:26:21,077 --> 00:26:24,179
...lump on my ball. And I go in for a scan.

493
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:25,448
Mmm-hmm.

494
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:29,051
Turns out that I have a very
large thing called an epididymis.

495
00:26:29,053 --> 00:26:31,687
Which is a thing that goes around the ball

496
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:33,488
and is like a sac underneath.

497
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,623
I have an extremely

498
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:36,525
- pronounced epididymis.
- I'm riveted...

499
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:38,661
I'm riveted by this. Do
you have any pictures?

500
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:42,296
It's almost as large as
another testicle unto itself.

501
00:26:42,298 --> 00:26:44,466
So get this. Cynthia...

502
00:26:44,468 --> 00:26:48,804
Guys. Cynthia wants me to
quit and open a B&B in Vermont.

503
00:26:48,806 --> 00:26:50,573
That sounds great. I'd love to see

504
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:52,275
Mark Baum run a bed and breakfast.

505
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,308
Like, "Here's your
steel-cut oatmeal, asshole."

506
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,978
<i>Mark refused to kiss the ring of
the people with the checkbooks,</i>

507
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,114
<i>so he had to set up his fund
under Morgan Stanley's umbrella.</i>

508
00:27:00,116 --> 00:27:03,884
<i>His small team reflected
his distrust of the system.</i>

509
00:27:03,886 --> 00:27:05,421
You guys are sick. You're sick.

510
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,657
She says this job is making me unhappy.

511
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:08,789
But you're happy when you're unhappy.

512
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:10,359
I am happy when I'm unhappy.

513
00:27:10,361 --> 00:27:11,426
<i>Vinnie Daniel.</i>

514
00:27:11,428 --> 00:27:12,661
You know how to make a muffin?

515
00:27:12,663 --> 00:27:14,462
- <i>Mark's numbers guy.</i>
- Do you even know how

516
00:27:14,464 --> 00:27:16,097
- to do laundry? Make a bed?
- Okay...

517
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:18,700
<i>Vinnie lost his father to a
violent crime when he was young.</i>

518
00:27:18,702 --> 00:27:20,603
<i>Just like Mark, he
didn't talk about it.</i>

519
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:21,970
I don't talk about that.

520
00:27:21,972 --> 00:27:24,373
Cynthia's no joke. She could
actually make him move to Vermont.

521
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:26,107
I mean, she made me
start wearing a seatbelt.

522
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:27,942
- Hey, you want me to...
- <i>Porter Collins.</i>

523
00:27:27,944 --> 00:27:30,211
<i>Former Olympic rower
who went to Brown.</i>

524
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:31,980
<i>He worked with Baum
at a previous firm</i>

525
00:27:31,982 --> 00:27:33,982
<i>and couldn't figure out why
no one listened to Baum.</i>

526
00:27:33,984 --> 00:27:36,117
<i>The guy with all the good ideas.</i>

527
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:38,053
Sorry. I think you have
the wrong FrontPoint.

528
00:27:38,055 --> 00:27:39,521
'Cause there is another FrontPoint

529
00:27:39,523 --> 00:27:40,890
in this same building that is bonds.

530
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:43,662
<i>And Danny Moses. The
optimist of the bunch.</i>

531
00:27:44,561 --> 00:27:46,161
<i>And a hell of a trader.</i>

532
00:27:46,163 --> 00:27:49,065
<i>Which is the only reason they put
up with his bullshit optimism.</i>

533
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,399
That was a weird call.

534
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:53,768
You take longer with a wrong
number than anybody else.

535
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:56,505
It was this guy from Deutsche

536
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:59,076
who was talking about
shorting housing bonds.

537
00:28:00,444 --> 00:28:01,744
And then in the middle of the call

538
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:02,978
I realized he had the wrong FrontPoint.

539
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,014
And then... 'Cause he wanted
the one on the 8th floor.

540
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,982
He wanted to short housing bonds?

541
00:28:07,984 --> 00:28:09,117
Uh-huh. That happens like five times a day

542
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,652
that somebody gets the wrong FrontPoint.

543
00:28:10,654 --> 00:28:11,821
We should change our name.

544
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:12,921
Wait. Wait.

545
00:28:12,923 --> 00:28:15,190
He wanted to short housing bonds?

546
00:28:15,192 --> 00:28:16,961
Who bets against housing?

547
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,260
What's the ABX at?

548
00:28:19,262 --> 00:28:20,528
What's ABX?

549
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,766
It tracks subprime mortgage
bond value. Go back to sleep.

550
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:26,168
The ABX is at, uh...

551
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:29,537
Wow, it's down! It's down
three points since last year.

552
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:31,840
That's weird. I haven't
heard a peep about that.

553
00:28:31,842 --> 00:28:32,975
What was this guy's name?

554
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:35,210
Jared Vennett. Vennett.

555
00:28:35,212 --> 00:28:37,513
<i>That's right. These
lucky sons of bitches</i>

556
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:40,349
<i>caught wind of one of the best
trades in Wall Street history</i>

557
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:42,017
<i>from a wrong number.</i>

558
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:44,386
<i>They should have paid 10%
to my fuckstick assistant.</i>

559
00:28:44,388 --> 00:28:46,788
His name was Jared Vennett. Vennett.

560
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,824
Jared Vennett from Deutsche.
Sounded very sketchy.

561
00:28:48,826 --> 00:28:50,559
Sounds like a douchebag.

562
00:28:50,561 --> 00:28:52,428
Do you smell that?

563
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,863
Do you smell that?

564
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,133
I smell money.

565
00:28:55,932 --> 00:28:57,335
This is your basic mortgage...

566
00:29:01,137 --> 00:29:03,307
Okay, hi. How are you?

567
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,172
Have a seat.

568
00:29:05,174 --> 00:29:07,912
Okay, Mr. Vennett from
Deutsche Bank. What do we have?

569
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,018
There you go.

570
00:29:17,488 --> 00:29:20,122
So, how many people have you
talked to about this trade?

571
00:29:20,124 --> 00:29:22,959
A few. There's definitely some interest.

572
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:24,459
- No!
- My boss would have my ass...

573
00:29:24,461 --> 00:29:25,960
- N.O.!
- You crazy, Jared?

574
00:29:25,962 --> 00:29:28,229
- Get lost.
- Fuck you.

575
00:29:28,231 --> 00:29:31,132
Which is why you're here
talking to us, a wrong number.

576
00:29:31,134 --> 00:29:32,633
Sounds like there's a lot of interest.

577
00:29:32,635 --> 00:29:35,036
All right. A few people have invited us in

578
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:37,506
just to laugh at me on
this deal. Is that you?

579
00:29:37,508 --> 00:29:38,606
Is that what this is?

580
00:29:38,608 --> 00:29:39,708
That's not what this is.

581
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,610
That's just how Mark is.

582
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:42,978
- Let's see what you got.
- I'm sorry.

583
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,746
You smell that? What is that?

584
00:29:44,748 --> 00:29:46,582
- What?
- What's that smell?

585
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:47,682
Your cologne?

586
00:29:47,684 --> 00:29:48,720
No.

587
00:29:50,988 --> 00:29:52,388
Opportunity.

588
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,756
No. Money.

589
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:55,157
- Oh...
- Okay.

590
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:57,192
- I smell money.
- Okay.

591
00:29:57,194 --> 00:29:58,594
Chris, God damn it.

592
00:29:58,596 --> 00:29:59,864
Sorry.

593
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,566
This is your basic mortgage bond.

594
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,902
All right? The originals were simple.

595
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:11,673
They were just thousands of
AAA mortgages bundled together,

596
00:30:11,675 --> 00:30:13,507
guaranteed by the U.S. government.

597
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:15,410
The modern ones are different.

598
00:30:15,412 --> 00:30:18,348
They're private. And they're
made up of layers of tranches.

599
00:30:23,586 --> 00:30:26,087
The highest level, AAA,
is getting paid first.

600
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:27,789
The lowest rated, B, is getting paid last,

601
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:29,357
taking on defaults first.

602
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:32,094
Now, obviously, if you're buying
B's, you could make more money.

603
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,362
But they're a little risky.

604
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:35,533
Sometimes they fail.

605
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:38,102
Chris?

606
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:44,273
Somewhere along the
line, these B's and BB's

607
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,807
went from a little risky

608
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:48,309
to dog shit. Where's the trash?

609
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:49,711
It's right behind you.

610
00:30:49,713 --> 00:30:52,648
I'm talking rock-bottom FICO scores.

611
00:30:53,784 --> 00:30:55,383
No income verification.

612
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:59,324
Adjustable rates. Dog shit!

613
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,726
The default rates are already
up from 1% to 4%, fellas.

614
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:06,728
And if they rise to 8%, and they will,

615
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,064
a lot of these BBB's
are going to zero, too.

616
00:31:09,066 --> 00:31:10,468
And that... You're too close.

617
00:31:12,236 --> 00:31:13,301
...is an opportunity.

618
00:31:13,303 --> 00:31:14,803
Okay.

619
00:31:14,805 --> 00:31:18,073
You're saying that at 8% the bonds
fail and we are already at 4%?

620
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:19,141
That's right.

621
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:21,043
If they go to 8%, it's Armageddon?

622
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,143
Yeah. That's right.

623
00:31:22,145 --> 00:31:23,978
How come nobody's talking about this?

624
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,213
You're completely sure of the math?

625
00:31:26,215 --> 00:31:28,851
Look at him. That's my quant.

626
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:29,985
Your what?

627
00:31:29,987 --> 00:31:31,853
My quantitative!

628
00:31:31,855 --> 00:31:34,655
My math specialist. Look at him.

629
00:31:34,657 --> 00:31:37,092
You notice anything different
about him? Look at his face.

630
00:31:37,094 --> 00:31:38,227
That's pretty racist.

631
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,796
Look at his eyes! I'll give you a hint.

632
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:42,333
His name's Yang!

633
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,901
He won a national math
competition in China!

634
00:31:46,903 --> 00:31:49,471
He doesn't even speak English!

635
00:31:49,473 --> 00:31:51,141
Yeah, I'm sure of the math.

636
00:31:52,843 --> 00:31:56,745
Actually, my name's Jiang
and I do speak English.

637
00:31:56,747 --> 00:31:58,279
Jared likes to say I
don't because he thinks

638
00:31:58,281 --> 00:32:00,181
it makes me seem more authentic.

639
00:32:00,183 --> 00:32:03,317
And I got second in that
national math competition.

640
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:08,289
So you're offering us a chance
to short this pile of blocks? How?

641
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:10,825
With something called
a credit default swap.

642
00:32:12,028 --> 00:32:14,629
It's like insurance on the
bond, and if it goes bust

643
00:32:14,631 --> 00:32:17,865
you can make 10-to-1,
even 20-to-1 return.

644
00:32:17,867 --> 00:32:20,268
And it's already slowly going bust!

645
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,438
10-to-1?
20-to-1? No way.

646
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,873
And no one's paying attention.

647
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:27,375
No one is paying attention!

648
00:32:27,377 --> 00:32:30,946
Because the banks are too
busy getting paid obscene fees

649
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:32,314
to sell these bonds.

650
00:32:32,316 --> 00:32:35,151
But wait. You are the
bank. You work for the bank.

651
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,253
I bet your margins are pretty nice and fat.

652
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,654
Let's not talk about
my margins, by the way.

653
00:32:39,656 --> 00:32:41,757
Being nice and fat, that's a nice
shirt. Do they make it for men?

654
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:44,125
Aren't you the bank?

655
00:32:44,127 --> 00:32:47,129
I work for the bank. I
don't think like a bank.

656
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:51,066
Big bank, small bank, I like
to make money. All right?

657
00:32:51,068 --> 00:32:53,901
Let me put it this way. I'm standing
in front of a burning house...

658
00:32:53,903 --> 00:32:56,738
And I'm offering you fire insurance on it.

659
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,374
How can these underlying
bonds be as bad as you say?

660
00:32:59,376 --> 00:33:00,674
It wouldn't be legal.

661
00:33:00,676 --> 00:33:02,711
Nobody knows what's in them.

662
00:33:02,713 --> 00:33:04,312
Nobody knows what's in the bonds.

663
00:33:04,314 --> 00:33:07,449
I've seen some that are 65% AAA-rated

664
00:33:07,451 --> 00:33:10,518
that I know for a fact are filled with 95%

665
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,755
subprime shit with FICOs below 550!

666
00:33:13,757 --> 00:33:14,989
Get the fuck out of here.

667
00:33:14,991 --> 00:33:16,423
You want me to really blow your mind?

668
00:33:16,425 --> 00:33:18,058
When the market deems
a bond too risky to buy,

669
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,363
what do you think we do with it?

670
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:21,729
Take a guess.

671
00:33:21,731 --> 00:33:23,064
I don't know. You tell me.

672
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:27,068
All right. You think we just
warehouse it on the books? No.

673
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,071
We just repackage it
with a bunch of other shit

674
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:31,175
that didn't sell and put it into a CDO.

675
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,809
- A CDO?
- Yes. A CDO.

676
00:33:34,811 --> 00:33:36,644
- What is that?
- This is where we take a bunch of B's,

677
00:33:36,646 --> 00:33:38,913
BB's and BBB's that haven't sold,

678
00:33:38,915 --> 00:33:40,585
and we put them in a pile.

679
00:33:42,118 --> 00:33:44,219
And when the pile gets large enough,

680
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:46,855
the whole thing is suddenly
considered diversified

681
00:33:46,857 --> 00:33:51,626
and the whores at the rating
agency give it a 92%-93% AAA rating,

682
00:33:51,628 --> 00:33:53,630
no questions asked.

683
00:33:55,298 --> 00:33:58,100
Hold it. What? Say that again.

684
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:00,436
A collateralized debt obligation.

685
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,036
It's important to understand
because it's what allowed

686
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:06,240
a housing crisis to become a
nationwide economic disaster.

687
00:34:06,242 --> 00:34:09,577
Here's world-famous chef
Anthony Bourdain to explain.

688
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,851
Okay, I'm a chef on a Sunday afternoon

689
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,686
setting the menu at a big restaurant.

690
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,188
I ordered my fish on Friday,

691
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,124
which is the mortgage bond
that Michael Burry shorted.

692
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,191
But some of the fresh fish doesn't sell.

693
00:34:24,193 --> 00:34:25,961
I don't know why. Maybe it just came out

694
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:27,662
halibut has the intelligence of a dolphin.

695
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:29,465
So, what am I going to do?

696
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:33,068
Throw all this unsold fish, which
is the BBB level of the bond,

697
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,506
in the garbage and take the loss?

698
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:37,572
No way.

699
00:34:37,574 --> 00:34:40,041
Being the crafty and morally
onerous chef that I am,

700
00:34:40,043 --> 00:34:42,844
whatever crappy levels
of the bond I don't sell,

701
00:34:42,846 --> 00:34:44,880
I throw into a seafood stew.

702
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:48,416
See, it's not old fish.
It's a whole new thing!

703
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:52,188
And the best part is they're
eating 3-day-old halibut.

704
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,988
That is a CDO.

705
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:56,925
I just need to know, how could
these possibly be collated?

706
00:34:56,927 --> 00:34:59,394
Somehow you're like Dora the Explorer

707
00:34:59,396 --> 00:35:00,762
and you're the first person

708
00:35:00,764 --> 00:35:02,164
- who found this thing.
- Hold on. Hold on.

709
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,132
So mortgage bonds are dog shit,

710
00:35:04,134 --> 00:35:06,400
CDOs are dog shit wrapped in cat shit.

711
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:09,771
Yeah, that's right.

712
00:35:09,773 --> 00:35:13,342
Institutions treat these CDOs like
they're as solid as treasury bonds,

713
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,809
and they're going to zero.

714
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:18,112
No. That can't be right.
There were $500 billion

715
00:35:18,114 --> 00:35:20,715
in housing bonds sold last year alone.

716
00:35:20,717 --> 00:35:23,452
The rating agencies, the
banks, the fucking government,

717
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,519
you're saying they're
all asleep at the wheel?

718
00:35:25,521 --> 00:35:29,858
Yeah. My whole department's
long on this stuff.

719
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:33,764
They call me Chicken Little.
They call me Bubble Boy.

720
00:35:36,432 --> 00:35:40,135
A's, zero. B's, zero.

721
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:43,374
BB's, zero. BBB's, zero.

722
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:47,275
And then that happens.

723
00:35:47,277 --> 00:35:48,945
What is that?

724
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,517
That's America's housing market.

725
00:35:55,485 --> 00:35:56,617
Thank you.

726
00:35:56,619 --> 00:35:57,686
Fuckin' A, Jared.

727
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,787
Shut your fucking mouth.

728
00:35:59,789 --> 00:36:00,923
...hang out with you.

729
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,090
Good. Okay.

730
00:36:02,092 --> 00:36:04,258
Sack up, do the deal. Let's be friends.

731
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,561
We will see. Thank you.

732
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:06,695
- Don't bullshit me.
- All right.

733
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:07,896
You're gonna say no, aren't you?

734
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:10,465
No. No, I'm just evaluating right now.

735
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:12,170
Thank you. Thank you for coming in.

736
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,572
Bye, Jared.

737
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,045
I don't like it.

738
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,780
He's playing us.

739
00:36:25,782 --> 00:36:27,715
He's playing us. He's got
too much skin in the game

740
00:36:27,717 --> 00:36:29,387
and he's dumping his position.

741
00:36:30,353 --> 00:36:31,920
What if he's right?

742
00:36:31,922 --> 00:36:33,521
You want him to be right.

743
00:36:33,523 --> 00:36:35,222
Yes, I do.

744
00:36:35,224 --> 00:36:38,392
The banks have given us 25%
interest rates on credit cards.

745
00:36:38,394 --> 00:36:40,262
They have screwed us on student loans

746
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:42,030
that we can never get out from under.

747
00:36:42,032 --> 00:36:45,300
Then this guy walks into my office and says

748
00:36:45,302 --> 00:36:48,369
those same banks got greedy,
they lost track of the market,

749
00:36:48,371 --> 00:36:50,472
and I can profit off of their stupidity?

750
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:52,807
Fuck, yeah, I want him to be right!

751
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:54,142
How come you don't hate this guy?

752
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,911
He's everything you taught us not to trust.

753
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,713
I can't hate him. He is so transparent

754
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,148
in his self-interest that
I kind of respect him.

755
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,251
Would I buy a car from him? No.

756
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:04,853
Is he right about the mortgage market?

757
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:06,021
No.

758
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:07,057
Let's find out. Let's find out.

759
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:10,559
Look. It's two very simple questions.

760
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,126
Is there a housing bubble?

761
00:37:12,128 --> 00:37:14,796
And if there is, how exposed are the banks?

762
00:37:14,798 --> 00:37:15,929
Yeah. Okay.

763
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:17,432
Let's get on this quickly too.

764
00:37:17,434 --> 00:37:18,900
Because if he's right,

765
00:37:18,902 --> 00:37:20,702
every loser with a couple million bucks

766
00:37:20,704 --> 00:37:22,340
and a fund is gonna be jumping on this.

767
00:37:22,905 --> 00:37:23,907
Let's go.

768
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,644
Just that morning...

769
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:35,119
JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase.

770
00:37:36,987 --> 00:37:39,354
Okay. Stop saying "JPMorgan Chase".

771
00:37:39,356 --> 00:37:40,856
I got a good feeling about this.

772
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:41,926
It's just a meeting though, you know?

773
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:44,659
It's just a meeting. It's something like...

774
00:37:44,661 --> 00:37:46,860
People have meetings
all the time. You know?

775
00:37:46,862 --> 00:37:48,563
People drink their coffee,
they have a meeting.

776
00:37:48,565 --> 00:37:49,963
- Brownfield Fund?
- Yes!

777
00:37:49,965 --> 00:37:51,932
- Hey. Hello.
- Ted.

778
00:37:51,934 --> 00:37:53,401
Chris. I'm on Ted's desk.

779
00:37:53,403 --> 00:37:54,802
Chris. Okay.

780
00:37:54,804 --> 00:37:56,070
- I'm Charlie, Charlie Geller.
- Charlie.

781
00:37:56,072 --> 00:37:57,771
- Jamie Shipley. Hi.
- Jamie.

782
00:37:57,773 --> 00:38:00,809
We're so excited to get set
up on your trading platform.

783
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,043
Cool.

784
00:38:02,045 --> 00:38:03,813
Here, have a seat a second.

785
00:38:04,581 --> 00:38:05,583
All right.

786
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:09,684
So, I... Ted had asked me
to do some meeting prep.

787
00:38:09,686 --> 00:38:13,121
But I couldn't find any
marketing material on you guys.

788
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:15,055
We just moved here from Boulder.

789
00:38:15,057 --> 00:38:16,624
- Yeah.
- Got it.

790
00:38:16,626 --> 00:38:19,094
Could we see some of
your offering documents?

791
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:22,197
Well, Brownfield is its own money.

792
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,965
- It's our money.
- Yeah.

793
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:25,833
Can you tell us how much you manage?

794
00:38:25,835 --> 00:38:29,403
Of course. We're doing
$30 million right now.

795
00:38:29,405 --> 00:38:30,706
Um, but we started

796
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,141
four years ago with $110,000.

797
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,508
Wow.

798
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:38,246
So, as you can see, that's
pretty phenomenal returns.

799
00:38:38,248 --> 00:38:41,583
We want to get an ISDA
agreement with JPMorgan so we can

800
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:44,151
deal in long-term options.

801
00:38:44,153 --> 00:38:45,489
- That's really cool.
- Yeah.

802
00:38:58,367 --> 00:39:00,267
That is so cool.

803
00:39:00,269 --> 00:39:01,603
Thank you.

804
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:05,740
But you guys are under the
capital requirements for an ISDA.

805
00:39:05,742 --> 00:39:06,744
By how much?

806
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,610
Uh...

807
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:11,981
One billion four hundred
seventy million, so...

808
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:14,518
...a lot.

809
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,318
This makes us look bad, doesn't it,

810
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,588
that we didn't know what the
capital requirements were?

811
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,592
Uh...

812
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,561
It's not great.

813
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,459
But, uh,

814
00:39:25,461 --> 00:39:27,996
keep up those returns and give us a call

815
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:29,865
way down the line. You know.

816
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:30,965
Okay?

817
00:39:30,967 --> 00:39:32,367
- Okay.
- Thanks, Chris.

818
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:33,434
Have a good one, guys.

819
00:39:33,436 --> 00:39:34,471
Thank you, Chris.

820
00:39:38,742 --> 00:39:39,744
Shit!

821
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,276
Who the fuck schedules a meeting

822
00:39:42,278 --> 00:39:43,412
at 4:50 in the afternoon?

823
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:44,479
Oh, my, God.

824
00:39:44,481 --> 00:39:46,313
That was so painful.

825
00:39:46,315 --> 00:39:50,017
Dude, B of A and Bear
didn't even return our calls.

826
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:52,287
And even fucking Wachovia

827
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:54,121
- blew us off, man!
- I know.

828
00:39:54,123 --> 00:39:56,458
Here's the prospectuses
of all the other losers

829
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,226
who didn't make it past the lobby.

830
00:39:58,228 --> 00:40:00,193
I don't think I can do
this anymore. You know.

831
00:40:00,195 --> 00:40:03,130
I'm young, yet. I can still
do something with my life.

832
00:40:03,132 --> 00:40:05,201
I miss Colorado anyway. The weed's better.

833
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,269
Gentlemen, I need you to leave.

834
00:40:08,271 --> 00:40:09,771
Yep, yep, we're going. Let's go.

835
00:40:09,773 --> 00:40:11,005
Look at this. Look at this.

836
00:40:11,007 --> 00:40:12,407
This guy

837
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:15,346
says that the housing
market's a giant bubble.

838
00:40:17,813 --> 00:40:19,947
Okay, so this part isn't
totally accurate, you know.

839
00:40:19,949 --> 00:40:22,150
We didn't find Jared
Vennett's housing bubble pitch

840
00:40:22,152 --> 00:40:24,151
in the lobby of a bank that rejected us.

841
00:40:24,153 --> 00:40:25,686
The truth is, um,

842
00:40:25,688 --> 00:40:28,623
a friend had told Charlie
about it, and I read about it

843
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,124
in <i>Grant's Interest Rate Observer.</i>

844
00:40:30,126 --> 00:40:31,559
This is crazy.

845
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:34,162
This is crazy stuff.

846
00:40:34,164 --> 00:40:36,898
Shit, he's saying that
there's 10-to-1 returns

847
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:40,635
on credit default swaps for
mortgage-backed securities?

848
00:40:40,637 --> 00:40:44,005
And the whole housing
market is about to collapse?

849
00:40:44,007 --> 00:40:45,807
<i>For Jamie and Charlie,
the housing market</i>

850
00:40:45,809 --> 00:40:48,342
<i>doomsday prediction was
music to their ears.</i>

851
00:40:55,885 --> 00:40:57,918
<i>They had started working
out of Jamie's garage</i>

852
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,920
<i>with $110,000 Jamie had saved</i>

853
00:40:59,922 --> 00:41:01,991
<i>taking sailboats up and
down the East Coast.</i>

854
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:05,793
Our investment strategy was simple.

855
00:41:05,795 --> 00:41:07,929
People hate to think
about bad things happening,

856
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:10,365
so they always underestimate
their likelihood.

857
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,870
<i>Their strategy was
simple and brilliant.</i>

858
00:41:13,402 --> 00:41:14,769
What he said.

859
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:17,338
<i>Jamie and Charlie found markets
will sell options very cheaply</i>

860
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,641
<i>on things they think
will never happen.</i>

861
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,309
<i>So when they were wrong,
they were wrong small,</i>

862
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:23,344
<i>but when they were right,
they were right big.</i>

863
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:33,954
<i>Within a few years they had
turned $110,000 into $30 million.</i>

864
00:41:33,956 --> 00:41:35,724
<i>But then it was time
to go to New York City.</i>

865
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:38,427
<i>And so far, it wasn't
going very well.</i>

866
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,262
So what if it does seem interesting. No...

867
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:43,767
No bank will give us our
ISDA. We're dead in the water.

868
00:41:45,268 --> 00:41:47,769
These kind of trades are
totally out of the question.

869
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,406
We got to call Ben.

870
00:41:51,608 --> 00:41:53,974
Let's call Ben!

871
00:41:53,976 --> 00:41:56,144
<i>Ben Rickert was a former
trader in Singapore</i>

872
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,979
<i>for Chase who quit the
whole game in disgust.</i>

873
00:41:58,981 --> 00:42:01,383
<i>He happened to be Jamie's neighbor
when they were in Colorado</i>

874
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,650
<i>and they met walking dogs.</i>

875
00:42:03,652 --> 00:42:05,220
<i>But Ben was dark.</i>

876
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:07,356
<i>He didn't just think the
whole system would fail.</i>

877
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,560
<i>He thought the whole
world was going down.</i>

878
00:42:11,628 --> 00:42:13,697
Every one of these vegetables
is fresh from my garden.

879
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:17,666
You guys should start your own garden.

880
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:21,135
- What you got to do is get your soil off the petrochemicals.
- Hmm.

881
00:42:21,137 --> 00:42:23,403
I used wood ash and urine
to help restore the soil.

882
00:42:23,405 --> 00:42:25,072
It creates ammonium nitrate.

883
00:42:25,074 --> 00:42:26,974
Seeds are gonna be the new currency.

884
00:42:26,976 --> 00:42:29,043
And not those Franken-seeds from Monsanto.

885
00:42:29,045 --> 00:42:31,713
I'm talking about good,
healthy, organic seeds.

886
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,981
Make yourself a garden.

887
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,483
- Learn to live off the land.
- You're a fucking lunatic.

888
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:36,751
<i>Ben had real experience
in a big bank.</i>

889
00:42:36,753 --> 00:42:40,554
<i>Jamie and Charlie had never even
been in a Manhattan bank bathroom.</i>

890
00:42:40,556 --> 00:42:42,322
<i>But Ben was done with
the banking world.</i>

891
00:42:42,324 --> 00:42:43,724
<i>He was very clear.</i>

892
00:42:43,726 --> 00:42:45,394
<i>All right, let's crunch some numbers</i>

893
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,862
<i>and then maybe we'll
talk about calling Ben.</i>

894
00:42:47,864 --> 00:42:48,996
We're always crunching numbers.

895
00:42:48,998 --> 00:42:50,130
When haven't we crunched the numbers?

896
00:42:50,132 --> 00:42:51,264
We're gonna crunch the
numbers like harder...

897
00:42:51,266 --> 00:42:52,333
I need you out of here.

898
00:42:52,335 --> 00:42:53,434
Of course. One second.

899
00:42:53,436 --> 00:42:54,438
Yes, ma'am. We're going.

900
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,840
Oh, God. I hate this. This
is a total waste of time.

901
00:42:59,842 --> 00:43:02,909
Oh, come on. Would you relax?

902
00:43:02,911 --> 00:43:06,146
There's a housing development
45 minutes outside town.

903
00:43:06,148 --> 00:43:08,081
Mark wants us to check that out first.

904
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:10,184
Well, I hope there are some Cuban
restaurants on the way there.

905
00:43:10,186 --> 00:43:12,887
Because I heard the Cuban
food is amazing in Miami.

906
00:43:12,889 --> 00:43:15,690
Please don't be chipper in
the face of me being miserable.

907
00:43:15,692 --> 00:43:17,425
It really makes me hate you.

908
00:43:17,427 --> 00:43:19,963
How is wanting to eat
good food being chipper?

909
00:43:21,697 --> 00:43:22,865
Hello?

910
00:43:24,266 --> 00:43:25,535
Hello?

911
00:43:26,302 --> 00:43:27,670
What do these go for?

912
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:31,041
$425,000 each?

913
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:54,563
What's up, man? What do you want?

914
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,296
Hello. I'm surveying mortgage owners

915
00:43:56,298 --> 00:43:57,965
who are over 90 days delinquent.

916
00:43:57,967 --> 00:44:00,601
I'm looking for a Harvey Humpsey.

917
00:44:00,603 --> 00:44:01,771
You want my landlord's dog?

918
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,472
Your landlord filled out
his mortgage application

919
00:44:05,474 --> 00:44:08,043
using his dog's name?

920
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:09,577
I guess so.

921
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:12,146
Wait, has that asshole not
been paying his mortgage?

922
00:44:12,148 --> 00:44:13,581
'Cause I've been paying my rent.

923
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:15,883
Well, yeah, he is over 90 days delinquent.

924
00:44:15,885 --> 00:44:17,519
Seriously, man,

925
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,420
am I gonna have to leave?

926
00:44:21,858 --> 00:44:24,325
'Cause my kid just got
settled in school, man.

927
00:44:24,327 --> 00:44:26,496
Hey. How are ya?

928
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,463
My name's Ken.

929
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:29,764
You're Ken?

930
00:44:29,766 --> 00:44:31,632
Um, you should talk to
your landlord about that.

931
00:44:31,634 --> 00:44:33,233
I'm sorry, I don't have
any more information.

932
00:44:33,235 --> 00:44:35,269
But you, um...

933
00:44:35,271 --> 00:44:36,936
You have a great day. See ya, Ken.

934
00:44:36,938 --> 00:44:38,440
There's books everywhere!

935
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:40,775
Books everywhere?

936
00:44:40,777 --> 00:44:44,110
Seriously, man, is
everything gonna be okay?

937
00:44:44,112 --> 00:44:47,282
You should... You should call him.

938
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:48,383
You should give him a call.

939
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,151
It's not my fault,
dude. I've been paying...

940
00:44:53,956 --> 00:44:55,025
Hello!

941
00:44:58,961 --> 00:45:01,162
Looks like the <i>Mary Celeste.</i>

942
00:45:01,164 --> 00:45:03,934
Look. All they took was the TV.

943
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,735
It's weird.

944
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:09,072
They didn't even clean out the cat litter.

945
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:18,682
Oh, God.

946
00:45:30,326 --> 00:45:32,325
It's like Chernobyl.

947
00:45:32,327 --> 00:45:35,733
There's like a hundred houses. There
can't be four people living here.

948
00:45:37,766 --> 00:45:38,932
Oh, fuck that!

949
00:45:38,934 --> 00:45:39,936
Shit!

950
00:45:54,851 --> 00:45:56,083
He's been in there for seven hours.

951
00:45:56,085 --> 00:45:58,286
Where does he go to the bathroom?

952
00:45:58,288 --> 00:45:59,454
I heard he had a breakdown.

953
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,521
He's letting the fund tank.

954
00:46:01,523 --> 00:46:03,090
My buddy in Manhattan said...

955
00:46:03,092 --> 00:46:04,958
Dr. Burry's office.

956
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,695
No, he actually prefers that you email him.

957
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,295
Excuse me.

958
00:46:08,297 --> 00:46:09,298
Mr. Fields, Mr...

959
00:46:13,436 --> 00:46:15,204
- Hi, Lawrence.
- Holy shit!

960
00:46:16,806 --> 00:46:20,441
We have no confidence in
your ability to identify

961
00:46:20,443 --> 00:46:24,378
macroeconomic trends.

962
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,981
You flew here to tell me that? Why?

963
00:46:26,983 --> 00:46:30,485
Anyone can see that there
is a real estate bubble.

964
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:32,420
Actually, no one can see a bubble.

965
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:33,720
That's what makes it a bubble.

966
00:46:33,722 --> 00:46:36,090
That's dumb, Lawrence.

967
00:46:36,092 --> 00:46:37,661
There's always markers.

968
00:46:38,427 --> 00:46:40,961
Mortgage fraud has

969
00:46:40,963 --> 00:46:42,831
quintupled since 2000

970
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,766
and the average take-home pay is flat,

971
00:46:45,768 --> 00:46:47,300
but home prices are soaring.

972
00:46:47,302 --> 00:46:49,470
That means the homes are debt, not assets.

973
00:46:49,472 --> 00:46:52,673
So Mike Burry of San Jose, a guy who

974
00:46:52,675 --> 00:46:56,177
gets his hair cut at Supercuts
and doesn't wear shoes,

975
00:46:56,179 --> 00:46:59,213
knows more than Alan
Greenspan and Hank Paulson.

976
00:46:59,215 --> 00:47:00,916
Well...

977
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:03,519
Dr. Mike Burry, yes, he does.

978
00:47:04,753 --> 00:47:06,621
That's cute. That's cute.

979
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,958
Are you being sarcastic with us, Mike?

980
00:47:12,094 --> 00:47:13,594
Lawrence,

981
00:47:13,596 --> 00:47:16,764
I don't know how to be sarcastic.

982
00:47:16,766 --> 00:47:19,535
I don't know how to be
funny. I don't know how to

983
00:47:20,202 --> 00:47:21,769
work people.

984
00:47:21,771 --> 00:47:23,003
I...

985
00:47:23,005 --> 00:47:25,438
I just know how to read numbers.

986
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,944
How big is your short position right now?

987
00:47:28,311 --> 00:47:29,443
Um...

988
00:47:29,445 --> 00:47:31,014
Just $1.3 billion.

989
00:47:31,614 --> 00:47:33,113
And the premiums?

990
00:47:33,115 --> 00:47:34,883
Well, we pay, uh,

991
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:38,351
roughly $80 to 90 million

992
00:47:38,353 --> 00:47:39,920
each year, which is high,

993
00:47:39,922 --> 00:47:42,057
but I was the first to do this trade.

994
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:45,626
Watch. It will pay. I may have
been early, but I'm not wrong.

995
00:47:45,628 --> 00:47:48,795
It's the same thing.
It's the same thing, Mike!

996
00:47:48,797 --> 00:47:53,467
You're managing a fund
of, what, $555 million?

997
00:47:53,469 --> 00:47:56,973
In six years, it'll all be gone.

998
00:47:57,773 --> 00:47:59,307
On one bet.

999
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:02,543
No, the second quarter of '07 is
when the adjustable rates kick in.

1000
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:04,144
The defaults will skyrocket.

1001
00:48:04,146 --> 00:48:05,914
Yeah. Says you.

1002
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,481
How much is eligible for
withdrawal before they do?

1003
00:48:08,483 --> 00:48:10,386
Say, in the next two quarters.

1004
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:13,123
If your investors panic.

1005
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:17,758
$302 million?

1006
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,762
I...

1007
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:21,264
My God, Mike.

1008
00:48:26,101 --> 00:48:28,135
No one will pull out.
That would be suicide.

1009
00:48:28,137 --> 00:48:30,670
I mean, I'm down 17% for the year.

1010
00:48:30,672 --> 00:48:33,039
But if they trust me, and
they trust me, because...

1011
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:35,742
No one trusts you! No one!

1012
00:48:35,744 --> 00:48:38,278
I sent several emails to my investors

1013
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,349
letting them know that the...

1014
00:48:41,951 --> 00:48:44,519
...the second quarter of '07 is when our

1015
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:46,957
housing positions show returns and...

1016
00:48:48,356 --> 00:48:50,391
I've been very clear.

1017
00:48:50,393 --> 00:48:53,795
People will withdraw their money.

1018
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:57,365
Lawrence, that would be
so stupid. I mean, the...

1019
00:48:57,367 --> 00:49:01,302
If the fund's capitals drop too much,

1020
00:49:01,304 --> 00:49:04,472
then the swaps contracts are voided.

1021
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:07,842
And then the banks get to
keep all of the collateral.

1022
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:09,010
Wait a minute. Wait.

1023
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:10,144
All of it.

1024
00:49:10,146 --> 00:49:12,380
The contracts are voided?

1025
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:14,150
The contracts are voided?

1026
00:49:14,884 --> 00:49:16,983
Holy shit!

1027
00:49:16,985 --> 00:49:18,020
Oh, motherfucker!

1028
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:20,554
Michael?

1029
00:49:20,556 --> 00:49:22,224
Give me my money back.

1030
00:49:25,628 --> 00:49:29,032
Michael, do you hear
me? I want my money back.

1031
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:33,836
Give me my fucking money back...

1032
00:49:34,903 --> 00:49:37,237
...you motherfucker.

1033
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:40,474
The market's in an itsy-bitsy
little gully right now.

1034
00:49:40,476 --> 00:49:42,809
It's like everybody said,
"Okay, that was crazy.

1035
00:49:42,811 --> 00:49:44,681
"Let's just all calm down."

1036
00:49:46,548 --> 00:49:50,416
I sold that house for
$350,000 the year it was built.

1037
00:49:50,418 --> 00:49:52,686
Two years later, $480,000.

1038
00:49:52,688 --> 00:49:55,990
Then $585,000 maybe 18 months ago.

1039
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:59,025
This couple bought it
for $650,000 last year.

1040
00:49:59,027 --> 00:50:00,961
He'd let it go for that.

1041
00:50:00,963 --> 00:50:02,729
Hi, John.

1042
00:50:02,731 --> 00:50:04,365
No, no, no.

1043
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:05,865
It will break his heart,
but he'll let it go.

1044
00:50:05,867 --> 00:50:07,702
Why is he selling?

1045
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:10,537
Neither one's working right now.

1046
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:13,273
Marlene, you'd say
they're motivated, right?

1047
00:50:13,275 --> 00:50:16,342
As motivated as one can
be in this neighborhood.

1048
00:50:16,344 --> 00:50:18,979
This house on the left, I would
say they're probably motivated.

1049
00:50:18,981 --> 00:50:21,014
Wow, a lot of people seem very motivated.

1050
00:50:21,016 --> 00:50:22,383
Oh, it's just the gully.

1051
00:50:22,385 --> 00:50:24,217
That's all. Just...

1052
00:50:24,219 --> 00:50:25,719
Just nerves.

1053
00:50:25,721 --> 00:50:27,456
So where do we stand?

1054
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:31,191
I need to talk to my wife. Um...

1055
00:50:31,193 --> 00:50:32,592
This market won't last.

1056
00:50:32,594 --> 00:50:34,461
Actually, could I talk
to a mortgage broker?

1057
00:50:34,463 --> 00:50:36,363
Anybody you recommend? Anybody you like.

1058
00:50:36,365 --> 00:50:38,465
Yes, yes, I have someone. Absolutely.

1059
00:50:38,467 --> 00:50:39,800
Yeah, bitch better like me.

1060
00:50:39,802 --> 00:50:41,235
Sent her ass to Cabo.

1061
00:50:42,672 --> 00:50:45,539
So is Morgan Stanley
recruiting us? Is that it?

1062
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:48,610
Oh, no. No. The bank owns our hedge fund,

1063
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:49,744
but we're not really part of it.

1064
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:52,313
We invest in financial service companies

1065
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:55,349
and we're trying to understand
the residential mortgage business.

1066
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:58,385
How many loans do you write each month?

1067
00:50:58,387 --> 00:51:00,021
- About 60.
- Yeah.

1068
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:01,490
What was it four years ago?

1069
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:03,858
Ten...

1070
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,193
Maybe 15.

1071
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:07,561
Yeah, I was a bartender. Now I own a boat.

1072
00:51:07,563 --> 00:51:08,662
You own a...

1073
00:51:08,664 --> 00:51:11,932
So how many of these are
adjustable-rate mortgages?

1074
00:51:11,934 --> 00:51:13,700
- Well, most.
- Oh, yeah.

1075
00:51:13,702 --> 00:51:15,735
Yeah, I'd say about 90%.

1076
00:51:15,737 --> 00:51:18,940
The bonuses on those
skyrocketed a few years ago.

1077
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:20,340
Adjustable's our bread and honey.

1078
00:51:20,342 --> 00:51:22,976
So do applicants ever get rejected?

1079
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:29,316
Seriously?

1080
00:51:29,318 --> 00:51:31,452
Look, if they get
rejected, I suck at my job.

1081
00:51:31,454 --> 00:51:33,052
Even if they have no money?

1082
00:51:33,054 --> 00:51:36,023
Well, my firm offers NINJA loans.

1083
00:51:36,025 --> 00:51:37,324
Okay.

1084
00:51:37,326 --> 00:51:38,825
"No Income, No Job."

1085
00:51:38,827 --> 00:51:41,095
I just leave the income
section blank if I want.

1086
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:42,429
Corporate doesn't care.

1087
00:51:42,431 --> 00:51:45,833
These people just want homes.
And they go with the flow.

1088
00:51:45,835 --> 00:51:46,900
Good for you.

1089
00:51:46,902 --> 00:51:47,937
Your companies don't verify?

1090
00:51:51,673 --> 00:51:54,541
If I write a loan on Friday afternoon,

1091
00:51:54,543 --> 00:51:56,545
a big bank will buy it by Monday lunch.

1092
00:51:57,079 --> 00:51:58,414
Yeah. Same here.

1093
00:52:00,215 --> 00:52:01,715
Could you hold on a second?

1094
00:52:01,717 --> 00:52:03,085
Yeah.

1095
00:52:08,757 --> 00:52:11,492
I don't get it. Why are they confessing?

1096
00:52:11,494 --> 00:52:13,594
They're not confessing.

1097
00:52:13,596 --> 00:52:15,264
They're bragging.

1098
00:52:24,005 --> 00:52:28,976
Do people have any idea
what they are buying?

1099
00:52:28,978 --> 00:52:31,311
I focus on the immigrants, you know.

1100
00:52:31,313 --> 00:52:32,813
Once they find out they're getting a home,

1101
00:52:32,815 --> 00:52:34,481
they sign where you tell them to sign.

1102
00:52:34,483 --> 00:52:36,717
Don't ask questions.
Don't understand the rates.

1103
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:38,251
- Fucking idiots.
- Yeah.

1104
00:52:38,253 --> 00:52:39,753
And you target immigrants, too?

1105
00:52:39,755 --> 00:52:42,688
Well, their credit actually
isn't bad enough for him.

1106
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,163
Look, I'm a yield guy.

1107
00:52:46,661 --> 00:52:48,795
Okay...

1108
00:52:48,797 --> 00:52:52,298
I make $2,000 on a
fixed-rate prime loan, right?

1109
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:56,003
But I can make $10,000
on a subprime adjustable.

1110
00:52:56,005 --> 00:52:59,072
Trust me, I'm not driving a
7 Series without strippers.

1111
00:52:59,074 --> 00:53:02,443
No one on the pole has good
credit and they're all cash rich.

1112
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:05,278
I think I read Warren Buffett
say something like that.

1113
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,048
What? Who's Warren Buffett?

1114
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:10,851
Okay, so strippers. Like exotic dancers?

1115
00:53:10,853 --> 00:53:12,153
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1116
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:14,188
Nude, you know, topless.

1117
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,025
- Strippers.
- Yeah.

1118
00:53:19,628 --> 00:53:20,894
Can you introduce us?

1119
00:53:20,896 --> 00:53:23,430
Yes! Yes.

1120
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,401
I always get option-pay adjustables.
I'm a private contractor.

1121
00:53:28,403 --> 00:53:30,170
What? I can't hear you. I'm sorry.

1122
00:53:30,172 --> 00:53:32,072
I always get option-pay adjustables.

1123
00:53:32,074 --> 00:53:34,407
I'm a private contractor.
I need flexibility.

1124
00:53:34,409 --> 00:53:37,077
And you tell the mortgage
company what you do?

1125
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:39,179
I write "therapist".

1126
00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:40,650
- You can touch me.
- Always?

1127
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:42,383
Only in V.I.P.

1128
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:45,084
No, no, no, you say you
always do adjustables.

1129
00:53:45,086 --> 00:53:46,987
And you have more than
one loan on a property?

1130
00:53:46,989 --> 00:53:49,255
Everybody does. At least down here.

1131
00:53:49,257 --> 00:53:50,356
I'm sorry, what?

1132
00:53:50,358 --> 00:53:53,026
Everybody does. At least down here.

1133
00:53:53,028 --> 00:53:55,262
That way you only put down, like, 5%.

1134
00:53:55,264 --> 00:53:57,164
Prices have leveled off, though, right?

1135
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:59,066
Yeah. There's a gully.

1136
00:53:59,068 --> 00:54:02,772
Would you mind not moving
anymore? I'll still pay you.

1137
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:09,376
Sorry. We're not alone.

1138
00:54:09,378 --> 00:54:12,079
Okay, look. If home prices don't go up,

1139
00:54:12,081 --> 00:54:14,447
you are not going to be able to refinance.

1140
00:54:14,449 --> 00:54:17,684
And you'll be stuck paying
whatever your monthly payment is

1141
00:54:17,686 --> 00:54:20,787
once it jumps up after
your teaser rate expires.

1142
00:54:20,789 --> 00:54:23,257
Your monthlies could go up 200%-300%.

1143
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:25,391
James says I can always refinance.

1144
00:54:25,393 --> 00:54:27,260
Well, he's a liar.

1145
00:54:27,262 --> 00:54:30,463
Actually, in this particular
case, James probably is wrong.

1146
00:54:30,465 --> 00:54:33,867
200 percent? On all my loans?

1147
00:54:33,869 --> 00:54:35,302
What do you mean "all" your loans?

1148
00:54:35,304 --> 00:54:37,740
We're talking about two
loans on one house, right?

1149
00:54:38,574 --> 00:54:40,641
I have five houses.

1150
00:54:40,643 --> 00:54:42,612
And a condo.

1151
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,079
Hey, there's a bubble.

1152
00:54:46,081 --> 00:54:47,313
<i>How do you know?</i>

1153
00:54:47,315 --> 00:54:50,650
Trust me. Call Vennett, buy
$50 million in swaps on the MBS.

1154
00:54:50,652 --> 00:54:53,686
What do we got? Garibaldi IV, BBB.

1155
00:54:53,688 --> 00:54:55,255
Mark, are you sure?

1156
00:54:55,257 --> 00:54:57,191
Yeah. Yeah, it's time to call bullshit.

1157
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:58,592
Bullshit on what?

1158
00:54:58,594 --> 00:54:59,862
Every fucking thing.

1159
00:55:24,019 --> 00:55:25,688
FrontPoint! FrontPoint!

1160
00:55:27,523 --> 00:55:29,423
Is this America's angriest hedge fund?

1161
00:55:29,425 --> 00:55:31,561
<i>All right, listen. I got
one last question for you.</i>

1162
00:55:32,728 --> 00:55:34,563
How are you fucking us?

1163
00:55:36,398 --> 00:55:37,998
There's a nicer way to say that, Vinnie.

1164
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,633
I'm serious.

1165
00:55:39,635 --> 00:55:42,802
We'll buy your swaps, but only
if you say how you're fucking us.

1166
00:55:42,804 --> 00:55:45,405
<i>I'm not fucking you,
Vinnie. I'm kissing you.</i>

1167
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:48,242
I'm looking deep into your eyes
as I make love to you, Vinnie.

1168
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:51,644
I'm handing you the deal of the
century on a fucking platter.

1169
00:55:51,646 --> 00:55:54,113
<i>What do I get out of it? Easy.</i>

1170
00:55:54,115 --> 00:55:56,617
I got a $20-million-a-month
negative carry.

1171
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:58,052
I got bosses trying to pull the plug

1172
00:55:58,054 --> 00:56:00,586
because they think I'm
out of my fucking mind.

1173
00:56:00,588 --> 00:56:01,655
All right?

1174
00:56:01,657 --> 00:56:02,822
We make this trade,

1175
00:56:02,824 --> 00:56:05,258
those problems aren't so big anymore.

1176
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:09,095
And sure, swaps are a dark
market, so I set the price.

1177
00:56:09,097 --> 00:56:10,664
Whatever price I want.

1178
00:56:10,666 --> 00:56:12,199
And when you come for the payday,

1179
00:56:12,201 --> 00:56:15,536
I'm gonna rip your eyes out,
I'm gonna make a fortune.

1180
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,137
<i>But the good news is,
Vinnie, you're not gonna care</i>

1181
00:56:17,139 --> 00:56:19,407
<i>because you're gonna make
so much fucking money.</i>

1182
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:20,807
<i>That's what I get out of it.</i>

1183
00:56:20,809 --> 00:56:22,275
<i>Want to know what you get out of it?</i>

1184
00:56:22,277 --> 00:56:25,746
You get the ice cream, the hot
fudge, the banana, and the nuts.

1185
00:56:25,748 --> 00:56:27,615
Right now, I get the sprinkles, and, yeah,

1186
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:30,316
if this goes through, I get the cherry.

1187
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:32,619
But you get the sundae, Vinnie.

1188
00:56:32,621 --> 00:56:34,289
<i>You get the sundae.</i>

1189
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,592
All right, I buy that. Thank you.

1190
00:56:39,594 --> 00:56:41,862
<i>So what do you say?</i>

1191
00:56:41,864 --> 00:56:43,831
- <i>You want me to make you a market?</i>
- Yeah.

1192
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:47,336
We'll take $50 million, Garibaldi IV, BBB.

1193
00:56:48,771 --> 00:56:50,840
Sharpen your pencils. I'll
get the paperwork ready.

1194
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,077
Fuck you, too.

1195
00:56:57,045 --> 00:56:58,547
Yes!

1196
00:57:00,682 --> 00:57:01,751
That's right.

1197
00:57:03,619 --> 00:57:05,619
Oh, man.

1198
00:57:05,621 --> 00:57:09,956
He has so many numbers, and I always forget

1199
00:57:09,958 --> 00:57:11,657
which one he prefers,
because he's very specific.

1200
00:57:11,659 --> 00:57:12,959
Start with the first one.

1201
00:57:12,961 --> 00:57:14,295
I don't know if it's the first one.

1202
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:15,662
Just try it.

1203
00:57:15,664 --> 00:57:17,233
Okay. I... Okay.

1204
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:36,316
Ben Rickert.

1205
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:37,620
<i>Hey, Ben. It's Jamie.</i>

1206
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:41,454
Jamie, you know you're not
supposed to use this line.

1207
00:57:43,492 --> 00:57:44,760
Told you.

1208
00:57:46,128 --> 00:57:48,798
Okay, let's try number two out of 14.

1209
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:01,474
Ben Rickert.

1210
00:58:01,476 --> 00:58:03,577
Ben, why do you do that, man? I mean...

1211
00:58:03,579 --> 00:58:06,079
You're a retired trader, okay?
No one is listening to your calls.

1212
00:58:06,081 --> 00:58:07,847
<i>The NSA has a $52 billion
budget and the ability</i>

1213
00:58:07,849 --> 00:58:09,316
to monitor tens of
millions of calls a second.

1214
00:58:09,318 --> 00:58:11,751
You think they're not using it?

1215
00:58:11,753 --> 00:58:14,655
Hey, I promise I will refrain from saying

1216
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,826
"Ben Rickert" and "dirty
bomb" in the same sent...

1217
00:58:18,693 --> 00:58:20,459
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- I'm sorry, dude.

1218
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,296
Ben Rickert.

1219
00:58:23,298 --> 00:58:25,666
Did you get a chance to look
at what we sent you, Ben?

1220
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,601
It's Charlie. I'm here, too.

1221
00:58:28,603 --> 00:58:30,939
<i>Hi, Charlie. Yeah, I did. Hold on.</i>

1222
00:58:36,911 --> 00:58:38,144
Ben, you still there?

1223
00:58:38,146 --> 00:58:39,248
<i>Yeah.</i>

1224
00:58:40,014 --> 00:58:42,148
I'll be honest, gentlemen.

1225
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:44,184
It scared the shit out of me.

1226
00:58:44,186 --> 00:58:45,653
But that's a good thing, right?

1227
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:48,458
That means this Vennett guy's not wrong.

1228
00:58:49,157 --> 00:58:50,226
No, he's not.

1229
00:58:52,961 --> 00:58:54,026
Cool.

1230
00:58:54,028 --> 00:58:55,695
Tell me more about these CDOs.

1231
00:58:55,697 --> 00:58:59,566
<i>Yeah, yeah. Okay, so, you know,
Vennett mentions the CDOs,</i>

1232
00:58:59,568 --> 00:59:01,202
but actually, we took a look

1233
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,936
and they're way worse
than even he realizes.

1234
00:59:02,938 --> 00:59:04,438
These things don't make any sense!

1235
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,773
<i>We can't even model them.</i>

1236
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:08,575
These are 100 times bigger than the MBS.

1237
00:59:08,577 --> 00:59:10,242
And 90% AAA-rated.

1238
00:59:10,244 --> 00:59:12,112
- Yes! Exactly!
- Over 90%.

1239
00:59:12,114 --> 00:59:13,313
<i>It's incredible.</i>

1240
00:59:13,315 --> 00:59:17,217
I took a good hard look at
the CDOs you want to short.

1241
00:59:17,219 --> 00:59:20,320
They're brilliant. Worthless. Total crap.

1242
00:59:20,322 --> 00:59:22,555
Jamie. Very good.

1243
00:59:22,557 --> 00:59:26,126
What can I say? I'm good at finding shit.

1244
00:59:26,128 --> 00:59:28,996
<i>So, Ben, we shorted
the BB's and the BBB's,</i>

1245
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:31,130
<i>and the risk is relatively low.</i>

1246
00:59:31,132 --> 00:59:32,532
<i>Payoff is,
like, 25-to-1.</i>

1247
00:59:32,534 --> 00:59:33,802
<i>Yeah.</i>

1248
00:59:36,137 --> 00:59:38,338
Okay, so, why are you calling
me? I don't do this anymore.

1249
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:39,509
Look, Ben?

1250
00:59:40,809 --> 00:59:44,644
We need you to help us get the ISDA.

1251
00:59:44,646 --> 00:59:47,813
If we get a hunting license,
we can short this crap.

1252
00:59:47,815 --> 00:59:49,115
<i>And we know you hate Wall Street.</i>

1253
00:59:49,117 --> 00:59:50,383
<i>We're not asking you
to do the trading.</i>

1254
00:59:50,385 --> 00:59:54,420
<i>We're simply asking you
to help us get a seat</i>

1255
00:59:54,422 --> 00:59:57,657
<i>at the fucking table.</i>

1256
00:59:57,659 --> 00:59:59,659
It's a pretty ugly table, guys.

1257
00:59:59,661 --> 01:00:04,764
Look, Ben, the system fucked
up in a big, big way here, okay?

1258
01:00:04,766 --> 01:00:07,166
And somehow, uh,

1259
01:00:07,168 --> 01:00:10,170
we know before anyone else.

1260
01:00:10,172 --> 01:00:13,108
You know? This is a
once-in-a-lifetime deal.

1261
01:00:15,677 --> 01:00:16,679
I'm thinking.

1262
01:00:21,782 --> 01:00:23,784
Okay. I'll call Deutsche Bank.

1263
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:26,119
Thank you, Ben. Thank you.

1264
01:00:26,121 --> 01:00:30,023
And Bear. What about Bear? They
have some reprehensible product.

1265
01:00:30,025 --> 01:00:32,362
<i>Okay. Bear will trade with anybody.</i>

1266
01:01:20,509 --> 01:01:23,342
All right. I'll see if
I can push it through.

1267
01:01:23,344 --> 01:01:25,180
Thank you, Noah. And thank Jared for us.

1268
01:01:27,148 --> 01:01:28,481
Couldn't we go inside?

1269
01:01:28,483 --> 01:01:29,686
Yeah, me, too.

1270
01:02:13,829 --> 01:02:16,229
Hi. It's Mark. I need to
talk to Vinnie right now.

1271
01:02:16,231 --> 01:02:19,833
We're just asking you to explain to us

1272
01:02:19,835 --> 01:02:22,369
just how it is that you are fucking us,

1273
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:23,606
because what we are seeing...

1274
01:02:26,507 --> 01:02:28,775
Morgan Stanley building, fast.

1275
01:02:28,777 --> 01:02:31,311
Are we hooked up to the
same computer screen?

1276
01:02:31,313 --> 01:02:33,213
It doesn't make any sense.

1277
01:02:35,851 --> 01:02:37,286
<i>Vinnie, you there?</i>

1278
01:02:37,719 --> 01:02:38,784
Mark, you there?

1279
01:02:38,786 --> 01:02:39,853
Yeah, did you hear?

1280
01:02:39,855 --> 01:02:41,688
Mortgage defaults have
gone through the roof.

1281
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:43,222
Is anybody jumping off of buildings yet?

1282
01:02:43,224 --> 01:02:45,492
Why would they? Subprime
mortgage bond prices are up.

1283
01:02:45,494 --> 01:02:46,726
What?

1284
01:02:46,728 --> 01:02:50,030
Vennett wants $1.9 million
more in collateral by close.

1285
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:51,398
Vennett's asking us to post collateral.

1286
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,898
What the hell is going on?

1287
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,934
We don't know, but Deutsche's
on the phone demanding payment.

1288
01:02:54,936 --> 01:02:56,836
<i>Call Vennett. Call that little shit.</i>

1289
01:02:56,838 --> 01:02:58,905
Call Vennett. Tell him
to get his ass down here.

1290
01:02:58,907 --> 01:03:00,773
So subprime loans go bad,

1291
01:03:00,775 --> 01:03:02,441
but subprime bonds, which are made up

1292
01:03:02,443 --> 01:03:04,077
of subprime loans, are more valuable?

1293
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:06,646
I know. They want another
$1.9 million by market close.

1294
01:03:06,648 --> 01:03:08,882
What about the ratings
agencies? Moody's, S&P...

1295
01:03:08,884 --> 01:03:11,383
Are they downgrading the
CDOs and mortgage bonds?

1296
01:03:11,385 --> 01:03:12,552
Where are the ratings agencies at?

1297
01:03:12,554 --> 01:03:14,153
They're the fucking same.

1298
01:03:14,155 --> 01:03:15,688
No, they're all still AAA.

1299
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:18,291
What the hell? Are you fucking kidding me?

1300
01:03:18,293 --> 01:03:20,459
Those fuckers! Those motherfuckers!

1301
01:03:20,461 --> 01:03:21,994
They go public, and all they care about

1302
01:03:21,996 --> 01:03:23,496
is their bottom line and their shit.

1303
01:03:23,498 --> 01:03:25,331
Hey, Mark, that's not all.

1304
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:26,733
The Morgan Stanley risk guys are here.

1305
01:03:26,735 --> 01:03:28,168
They called in Kathy Tao.

1306
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:30,403
They're trying to convince
her to make us sell our swaps.

1307
01:03:30,405 --> 01:03:32,706
Apparently, tying up six
years of insurance payments

1308
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:34,541
in hopes of a housing Armageddon

1309
01:03:34,543 --> 01:03:35,941
<i>is not prudent investing.</i>

1310
01:03:35,943 --> 01:03:37,311
What did Kathy say?

1311
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:40,045
Nothing yet. She keeps asking
if this is one of your crusades.

1312
01:03:40,047 --> 01:03:42,081
Okay, I want you to walk back in there

1313
01:03:42,083 --> 01:03:44,351
and very calmly, very politely,

1314
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:46,619
tell the risk assessors to fuck off.

1315
01:03:46,621 --> 01:03:48,354
And then meet me over at Standard & Poor's.

1316
01:03:48,356 --> 01:03:49,956
We're gonna talk to Georgia.

1317
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:51,090
<i>All right. Okay.</i>

1318
01:03:51,092 --> 01:03:53,059
Get that fuck Jared Vennett in this office.

1319
01:03:53,061 --> 01:03:54,864
<i>I'm gonna bash his fucking head in.</i>

1320
01:03:59,867 --> 01:04:01,534
Uh, gentlemen?

1321
01:04:01,536 --> 01:04:04,606
I spoke with Mark Baum.
He says to fuck off.

1322
01:04:18,385 --> 01:04:20,722
I can't see a damn thing.

1323
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:24,691
My eye doctor's always busy.

1324
01:04:24,693 --> 01:04:26,559
I end up taking any
appointment they'll give me,

1325
01:04:26,561 --> 01:04:28,897
and then the whole
morning gets shot to hell!

1326
01:04:30,065 --> 01:04:31,567
So...

1327
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:33,967
All righty,

1328
01:04:33,969 --> 01:04:37,003
FrontPoint Partners,

1329
01:04:37,005 --> 01:04:39,438
how can Standard & Poor's help you?

1330
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,773
Well, we don't understand why

1331
01:04:40,775 --> 01:04:43,510
the ratings agencies haven't
downgraded subprime bonds

1332
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:46,646
since the underlying loans
are clearly deteriorating.

1333
01:04:46,648 --> 01:04:49,148
Well, the delinquency rates
do have people worried,

1334
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:51,016
but they're actually within our models.

1335
01:04:51,018 --> 01:04:52,954
- So...
- Says you.

1336
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:56,623
...you're convinced
the underlying mortgages

1337
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:59,193
in these bonds are solid loans.

1338
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:01,161
That is our opinion, yes.

1339
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:03,329
Have you looked at the loan-level data?

1340
01:05:03,331 --> 01:05:05,130
I mean, they're giving these loans

1341
01:05:05,132 --> 01:05:06,465
to anybody with a credit score and a pulse.

1342
01:05:06,467 --> 01:05:09,168
Excuse me, sir. What do you
think we do here all day?

1343
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:10,269
We're not sure. That's why we're here.

1344
01:05:10,271 --> 01:05:11,470
Here's what I don't understand...

1345
01:05:11,472 --> 01:05:13,305
We check, recheck, recheck again.

1346
01:05:13,307 --> 01:05:14,708
If these mortgage bonds are so stable...

1347
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:16,476
Perhaps you could check your friend.

1348
01:05:16,478 --> 01:05:18,579
...have you ever refused to rate...

1349
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,012
Ma'am, that's delusional.

1350
01:05:20,014 --> 01:05:21,215
We stand behind them.

1351
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:22,882
Georgia, have you ever refused to rate

1352
01:05:22,884 --> 01:05:26,253
any of these bonds upper tranches AAA?

1353
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:27,920
Can we see the paperwork on those deals?

1354
01:05:27,922 --> 01:05:30,023
I am under no obligation
to share that information

1355
01:05:30,025 --> 01:05:31,191
with you, whoever you might be.

1356
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:32,992
Just answer the question, Georgia.

1357
01:05:32,994 --> 01:05:35,061
Can you name one time in the past year

1358
01:05:35,063 --> 01:05:36,463
where you checked the tape

1359
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:40,670
and you didn't give the banks
the AAA percentage they wanted?

1360
01:05:42,938 --> 01:05:44,170
If we don't give them the ratings,

1361
01:05:44,172 --> 01:05:47,005
they'll go to Moody's,
right down the block.

1362
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:51,010
If we don't work with them,
they will go to our competitors.

1363
01:05:51,012 --> 01:05:54,182
Not our fault. Simply
the way the world works.

1364
01:05:58,519 --> 01:05:59,820
Holy shit.

1365
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:01,023
Yes, now you see.

1366
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:04,224
And I never said that.

1367
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:06,693
They're selling ratings for fees.

1368
01:06:06,695 --> 01:06:07,760
A ratings shop.

1369
01:06:07,762 --> 01:06:10,664
You can afford to make less. Make less.

1370
01:06:10,666 --> 01:06:12,632
Nobody said that.

1371
01:06:12,634 --> 01:06:14,900
And it is not my decision. I have a boss.

1372
01:06:14,902 --> 01:06:16,369
Are you kidding me?

1373
01:06:16,371 --> 01:06:17,769
No, I am not "kidding you".

1374
01:06:17,771 --> 01:06:20,139
How'd your boss do on the IPO?

1375
01:06:20,141 --> 01:06:21,441
Is that the angle you're taking?

1376
01:06:21,443 --> 01:06:25,077
So, now, anyone who has a
boss can't be held responsible

1377
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:26,579
for doing shitty and illegal things.

1378
01:06:26,581 --> 01:06:28,215
What are you, four?

1379
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:32,619
No, I am not four, Mr. Baum. I am not, no.

1380
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:36,123
And I wonder what your incentives might be.

1381
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:37,757
Is it maybe in your best interest

1382
01:06:37,759 --> 01:06:40,730
to have the ratings change? Is it, perhaps?

1383
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:45,067
How many credit default
swaps do you own? Hmm?

1384
01:06:47,135 --> 01:06:49,101
It doesn't make me wrong.

1385
01:06:49,103 --> 01:06:50,302
No.

1386
01:06:50,304 --> 01:06:52,407
It just makes you a hypocrite.

1387
01:07:33,047 --> 01:07:35,148
Fuck!

1388
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:36,349
<i>Mortgage delinquencies went up</i>

1389
01:07:36,351 --> 01:07:38,452
<i>and the CDOs got more
valuable. Unbelievable.</i>

1390
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:39,651
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

1391
01:07:39,653 --> 01:07:40,820
We know. It's completely backwards.

1392
01:07:40,822 --> 01:07:42,454
<i>I just called an old friend at Bear.</i>

1393
01:07:42,456 --> 01:07:44,224
<i>He didn't even know what a CDO is.</i>

1394
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:48,661
Yeah, I just had to wire
Bear and Deutsche $70,000.

1395
01:07:48,663 --> 01:07:51,000
It's like two plus two equals

1396
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,731
fish.

1397
01:07:52,733 --> 01:07:55,501
It's rigged. We bought into a rigged game.

1398
01:07:55,503 --> 01:07:57,369
We're gonna lose everything.

1399
01:07:57,371 --> 01:07:59,808
I'm gonna have to move back in with my mom.

1400
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:01,840
Can't do that.

1401
01:08:01,842 --> 01:08:04,077
<i>All right. Well, I got
a colonic appointment.</i>

1402
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:05,811
Wait a minute. Hold on, Ben.

1403
01:08:05,813 --> 01:08:07,246
Ben, look.

1404
01:08:07,248 --> 01:08:09,715
Either the banks are clueless

1405
01:08:09,717 --> 01:08:12,084
and they don't know
how to value these CDOs,

1406
01:08:12,086 --> 01:08:17,257
or they're such crooks
that the CDOs are worth shit

1407
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,860
and they're hiding it.

1408
01:08:21,162 --> 01:08:22,630
I think we should buy more swaps.

1409
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:24,296
What?

1410
01:08:24,298 --> 01:08:26,400
Suck it up and pay up,
fellas. We made a deal.

1411
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:28,500
No way! No!

1412
01:08:28,502 --> 01:08:30,003
Are you fucking kidding me?

1413
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:32,437
Are you serious? You think this is a game?

1414
01:08:32,439 --> 01:08:33,840
No. No. No. No. No.

1415
01:08:33,842 --> 01:08:35,110
Yeah. Yeah.

1416
01:08:41,649 --> 01:08:43,450
No! No! No!

1417
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:45,218
<i>No, seriously, a
colonic once a year.</i>

1418
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:46,619
Ass!

1419
01:08:46,621 --> 01:08:48,687
And you got a matching little
butler boy, you buttfuck!

1420
01:08:52,961 --> 01:08:54,861
- Are you done?
- I think so, yeah.

1421
01:08:54,863 --> 01:08:57,633
God! I pulled a muscle
in my back from yelling.

1422
01:08:58,533 --> 01:09:00,232
Ow!

1423
01:09:00,234 --> 01:09:03,903
Mortgage defaults have
done nothing but go up.

1424
01:09:03,905 --> 01:09:07,941
Yet you quote us a
higher price on the bonds.

1425
01:09:07,943 --> 01:09:10,143
Please explain that to me.
There's no way that makes sense.

1426
01:09:10,145 --> 01:09:13,812
There's no way you're marking
these swaps appropriately.

1427
01:09:13,814 --> 01:09:15,717
Why shouldn't we back out
of this trade right now?

1428
01:09:18,252 --> 01:09:20,018
Didn't I say when we made this deal

1429
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:21,754
that the ratings agencies, the SEC

1430
01:09:21,756 --> 01:09:24,324
and the big banks were
clueless? Didn't I say that?

1431
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:25,692
- Yes.
- Didn't I say it?

1432
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:27,660
Yes, you did. You did.

1433
01:09:27,662 --> 01:09:29,196
Shut up.

1434
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:30,629
Now their foot's on fire, they think

1435
01:09:30,631 --> 01:09:32,264
their steak is done, and you're surprised?

1436
01:09:32,266 --> 01:09:35,134
That's not stupidity. That's fraud.

1437
01:09:35,136 --> 01:09:36,937
Tell me the difference
between stupid and illegal,

1438
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:39,005
and I'll have my wife's brother arrested.

1439
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:42,442
That was funny.

1440
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:45,678
I guess you just don't realize
how clueless the system really is.

1441
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:48,080
Yes, there's some shady shit going down,

1442
01:09:48,082 --> 01:09:51,420
but trust me, it's fueled by stupidity!

1443
01:09:52,654 --> 01:09:54,787
Look at yourselves.

1444
01:09:54,789 --> 01:09:58,324
You know, you pass yourself
off as cynical people

1445
01:09:58,326 --> 01:10:00,794
but you still have some faith
in the system, don't you?

1446
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:02,161
I don't.

1447
01:10:02,163 --> 01:10:05,097
Well, except for Vinnie.
And who gives a shit?

1448
01:10:05,099 --> 01:10:06,933
- No way!
- Look...

1449
01:10:06,935 --> 01:10:10,204
Either we're right or we're
wrong in a giant, giant way.

1450
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,171
And if we're wrong, then
we got to find someone

1451
01:10:12,173 --> 01:10:13,874
to help us get out of this trade.

1452
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:16,710
I'm not feeling remotely
confident that we're right.

1453
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:20,213
And if we're wrong, who's gonna tell us?

1454
01:10:20,215 --> 01:10:23,652
Who understands this
stuff? It makes no sense!

1455
01:10:26,087 --> 01:10:27,955
<i>I think we need to go to Vegas.</i>

1456
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:29,121
What's in Vegas?

1457
01:10:29,123 --> 01:10:30,223
Vegas?

1458
01:10:30,225 --> 01:10:32,094
What the hell's in Las Vegas?

1459
01:10:33,194 --> 01:10:36,495
The American Securitization
Forum is there next week.

1460
01:10:36,497 --> 01:10:38,999
Every bond and CDO
salesman, subprime lender

1461
01:10:39,001 --> 01:10:41,166
and swap trader is gonna be there.

1462
01:10:41,168 --> 01:10:44,003
I'm telling you, your
bet is against dumb money.

1463
01:10:44,005 --> 01:10:46,906
It's about time you find out just
how dumb that money really is.

1464
01:10:46,908 --> 01:10:48,174
God, I hate Vegas.

1465
01:10:48,176 --> 01:10:49,675
I hear the food has gotten
really good in Vegas.

1466
01:10:49,677 --> 01:10:51,244
They have a Nobu now.

1467
01:10:51,246 --> 01:10:52,815
Would you fucking stop it?

1468
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:40,360
Any sense?

1469
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:42,195
And if a bond is "rich" it is...

1470
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:43,830
I don't know, loaded with assets?

1471
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:45,365
"Rich" just means overpriced.

1472
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:47,433
I can't sleep on planes,
so I did my homework.

1473
01:11:47,435 --> 01:11:49,936
Okay, let's focus. What's our goal?

1474
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:52,339
To figure out if this
is a deal of a lifetime

1475
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:54,206
or if everyone here
knows something we don't

1476
01:11:54,208 --> 01:11:56,142
and we're gonna get royally screwed.

1477
01:11:56,144 --> 01:11:59,044
Right. Remember that when you
meet with the guys from Bear.

1478
01:11:59,046 --> 01:12:00,880
I set you up with
a face-to-face.

1479
01:12:00,882 --> 01:12:02,481
- Awesome.
- Where is that?

1480
01:12:02,483 --> 01:12:06,686
Holy shit. Five years ago,
Securitization was a loser convention.

1481
01:12:06,688 --> 01:12:08,888
100, maybe 200 people would show.

1482
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:11,156
$500 billion a year later, you get this.

1483
01:12:11,158 --> 01:12:12,858
There's a lot of smug-looking
people in here, huh?

1484
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:16,396
It's like someone hit a pinata filled
with white people who suck at golf.

1485
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:17,996
I mean, who are all these clowns?

1486
01:12:17,998 --> 01:12:19,532
Oh, come on. I think it looks fun.

1487
01:12:19,534 --> 01:12:23,001
Certainly. Vennett says these are
the people we're betting against.

1488
01:12:23,003 --> 01:12:24,970
- Yeah, here we go. Here we go.
- There he is.

1489
01:12:24,972 --> 01:12:26,708
Chris, on my left. Chris, on my left.

1490
01:12:27,175 --> 01:12:28,374
Gentlemen.

1491
01:12:28,376 --> 01:12:30,242
When do we get a chance to face time

1492
01:12:30,244 --> 01:12:32,044
with some of these lovely folks?

1493
01:12:32,046 --> 01:12:33,580
Chris, give him the keycards.

1494
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:34,880
Do you even know which
keycards you're giving out?

1495
01:12:34,882 --> 01:12:36,382
- You're just giving them out?
- Thank you.

1496
01:12:36,384 --> 01:12:38,750
First of all, how was your
travel? How are you? Uneventful?

1497
01:12:38,752 --> 01:12:40,053
- Uneventful.
- Okay.

1498
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:41,854
I've been here for six hours.
I've already been to the gym,

1499
01:12:41,856 --> 01:12:43,255
I had two poached eggs

1500
01:12:43,257 --> 01:12:44,991
and I played blackjack
with Harry Dean Stanton.

1501
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:46,893
Thank you for your diary.

1502
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:48,593
Face time. I'd like some face time.

1503
01:12:48,595 --> 01:12:50,162
Just remember. We're here
to gather information.

1504
01:12:50,164 --> 01:12:51,664
We're gathering information, okay?

1505
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:54,133
We're not advertising our
short position. All right?

1506
01:12:54,135 --> 01:12:55,835
We don't want to spook
everybody. Can you do that?

1507
01:12:55,837 --> 01:12:57,470
I know you got a big
mouth, you like to run it.

1508
01:12:57,472 --> 01:12:59,371
Can you just keep it shut for a few days?

1509
01:12:59,373 --> 01:13:00,507
Okay. Okay.

1510
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:02,442
Yeah, don't worry. We'll play nice.

1511
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:03,843
Ladies and gentlemen.

1512
01:13:03,845 --> 01:13:06,144
Business is good.

1513
01:13:06,146 --> 01:13:07,613
Profits are strong

1514
01:13:07,615 --> 01:13:10,650
and the mortgage
continues to be the bedrock

1515
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:13,251
on which this economy is built.

1516
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:19,291
And, yes, we had to take some losses

1517
01:13:19,293 --> 01:13:22,695
in our subprime department
last year, but those losses

1518
01:13:22,697 --> 01:13:25,464
will be contained at only 5%.

1519
01:13:25,466 --> 01:13:27,700
Now, in our residential sector...

1520
01:13:27,702 --> 01:13:28,968
Mark, it's not a Q and A.

1521
01:13:28,970 --> 01:13:30,736
...our rollout of those
variable rate packages

1522
01:13:30,738 --> 01:13:32,472
were gobbled up by the consumers!

1523
01:13:32,474 --> 01:13:34,543
I have a question, please.

1524
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:37,477
Uh...

1525
01:13:37,479 --> 01:13:39,678
Sir, the Q and A is after my statements.

1526
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:42,182
But you know what? You seem
anxious. How can I help you?

1527
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:44,183
- Thank you. How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

1528
01:13:44,185 --> 01:13:47,387
Would you say that it is a possibility

1529
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:52,223
or a probability that
subprime losses stop at 5%?

1530
01:13:52,225 --> 01:13:53,425
Thank you.

1531
01:13:53,427 --> 01:13:58,665
I would say it is a very
strong probability, indeed.

1532
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:01,334
So back to the residential sector.

1533
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:03,536
When we rolled out the new
variable rates package...

1534
01:14:03,538 --> 01:14:06,041
- Excuse me.
- Um...

1535
01:14:07,542 --> 01:14:08,674
Yes, sir.

1536
01:14:08,676 --> 01:14:12,178
Zero! Zero!

1537
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:15,048
There is a 0% chance

1538
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:18,918
that your subprime losses will stop at 5%.

1539
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,085
Zero.

1540
01:14:20,087 --> 01:14:21,687
Excuse me.

1541
01:14:21,689 --> 01:14:22,821
I have to take this.

1542
01:14:22,823 --> 01:14:24,891
He must be from Bank of America.

1543
01:14:26,494 --> 01:14:27,927
Our subprime department is fine.

1544
01:14:27,929 --> 01:14:29,262
No, I'm not doing anything right now.

1545
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:30,897
As I was saying, our
residential department...

1546
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:32,164
How are the kids?

1547
01:14:32,166 --> 01:14:34,634
...consumers reacted to our packages...

1548
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:36,369
Mark Baum really did that.

1549
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:37,736
When we were in Vegas, he did that.

1550
01:14:37,738 --> 01:14:40,339
He said that, he took the call.

1551
01:14:40,341 --> 01:14:42,407
Now you see what I had to deal with?

1552
01:14:55,722 --> 01:14:57,956
Yeah, the Beretta... Meh.

1553
01:14:57,958 --> 01:15:00,259
But this Uzi is fucking awesome!

1554
01:15:00,261 --> 01:15:02,928
I need this CDO machine to
run for another two years.

1555
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:06,266
And then I'm rich as fuck
and I got my house in Aspen.

1556
01:15:06,268 --> 01:15:09,535
But do you have any concerns
about the performance

1557
01:15:09,537 --> 01:15:11,204
of the underlying securitizations?

1558
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:13,071
It's easy to see that delinquencies

1559
01:15:13,073 --> 01:15:16,041
and default rates are
on the rise right now.

1560
01:15:16,043 --> 01:15:18,611
Could you please stop
being such a buzzkill, dude?

1561
01:15:18,613 --> 01:15:21,214
We didn't bring you out
here to talk about work, bro.

1562
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:22,781
Why did you bring us out here?

1563
01:15:22,783 --> 01:15:26,050
Because we need to be able to
expense the ammo to a client.

1564
01:15:26,052 --> 01:15:29,287
I'm gonna go shoot some terrorists.
Watch how it's done, boys!

1565
01:15:29,289 --> 01:15:30,656
These guys are morons.

1566
01:15:30,658 --> 01:15:32,592
- Fucking tool.
- Whoo!

1567
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:33,662
These guys are morons.

1568
01:15:34,796 --> 01:15:36,094
Fuck, yes! Boom!

1569
01:15:36,096 --> 01:15:37,495
Yeah, man!

1570
01:15:37,497 --> 01:15:39,799
We need to be buying up every
swap we can get our hands on here.

1571
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:42,168
Just hold on, okay? Hold on.

1572
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:44,571
My brother's ex-girlfriend
works for the SEC.

1573
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:46,505
She just told me she's in town, okay?

1574
01:15:46,507 --> 01:15:48,741
So, if we're missing something,
maybe she can tell me.

1575
01:15:48,743 --> 01:15:50,442
You know, give me some insight.

1576
01:15:50,444 --> 01:15:52,311
In the meantime, you go to the main floor

1577
01:15:52,313 --> 01:15:54,479
<i>and price some swaps.</i>

1578
01:15:54,481 --> 01:15:55,982
Well, actually, we're

1579
01:15:55,984 --> 01:15:58,550
about to invest in housing bonds, and...

1580
01:15:58,552 --> 01:16:01,321
I was wondering if the SEC
is worried about them at all.

1581
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:04,123
I know you're not allowed to tell
me specifics, but just generally.

1582
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:06,424
Oh, we don't investigate mortgage bonds.

1583
01:16:06,426 --> 01:16:09,764
Truth is, since we got our budget
cut, we don't investigate much.

1584
01:16:11,832 --> 01:16:13,366
Then why are you here? I thought...

1585
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:14,866
I'm not here for the SEC.

1586
01:16:14,868 --> 01:16:16,537
I'm here on my own dime.

1587
01:16:17,471 --> 01:16:20,772
I'm floating my resume to some big banks.

1588
01:16:20,774 --> 01:16:22,441
How's your brother, by the way?

1589
01:16:22,443 --> 01:16:24,410
How are you floating
your resume to big banks?

1590
01:16:24,412 --> 01:16:25,910
I mean, you're supposed to be the ones,

1591
01:16:25,912 --> 01:16:27,313
you know, policing the big banks.

1592
01:16:27,315 --> 01:16:28,880
Grow up, Jamie.

1593
01:16:28,882 --> 01:16:32,686
There must be some kind of law against
working for a financial institution

1594
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:34,352
right after you've been working

1595
01:16:34,354 --> 01:16:35,955
in financial regulation, right?

1596
01:16:35,957 --> 01:16:38,060
No. No.

1597
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:42,527
Hey! Dougie!

1598
01:16:42,529 --> 01:16:45,565
Hey! Come over here. What
are you doing at Caesars?

1599
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:47,069
He's at Goldman.

1600
01:16:47,702 --> 01:16:48,933
See you.

1601
01:16:48,935 --> 01:16:53,940
We can do BBB-level swaps
at 500 basis points. Maybe.

1602
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:57,809
You're pricing the swaps like
the bond is gonna collapse

1603
01:16:57,811 --> 01:17:00,745
even though the bond
value's going up? Really?

1604
01:17:00,747 --> 01:17:02,147
Sign of the times.

1605
01:17:02,149 --> 01:17:03,217
What the hell is going on?

1606
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:05,678
Lewis, can you come in
early tomorrow, please?

1607
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:08,046
I need to unload the AIG and Countrywide

1608
01:18:08,048 --> 01:18:09,616
and Freddie Mac positions

1609
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:12,250
so that we can afford
the premiums on the...

1610
01:18:13,354 --> 01:18:16,722
...core mortgage shorts on the swaps.

1611
01:18:16,724 --> 01:18:18,226
No problem, Dr. Burry.

1612
01:18:20,261 --> 01:18:21,430
- Dr. Burry?
- Hmm?

1613
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:26,165
If the investors withdraw,

1614
01:18:26,167 --> 01:18:29,034
what's going to happen here? Are we done?

1615
01:18:29,036 --> 01:18:30,939
Honestly, I don't know.

1616
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:40,882
The bonds aren't going down.

1617
01:18:42,115 --> 01:18:45,217
They won't move. It's possible

1618
01:18:45,219 --> 01:18:49,791
that we are in a completely
fraudulent system.

1619
01:18:51,225 --> 01:18:53,895
Or... You're wrong.

1620
01:18:58,632 --> 01:19:00,499
Sure.

1621
01:19:00,501 --> 01:19:04,506
It's possible I'm wrong.
I just don't know how.

1622
01:19:09,210 --> 01:19:13,745
I guess when someone's wrong, they never...

1623
01:19:13,747 --> 01:19:15,983
They never know how.

1624
01:19:20,287 --> 01:19:21,454
See you in the morning.

1625
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:22,490
Yeah.

1626
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:26,892
Even Bear upped their prices.

1627
01:19:26,894 --> 01:19:29,461
And they keep calling us Brownhole.

1628
01:19:29,463 --> 01:19:31,162
You just don't have the
money or the reputation.

1629
01:19:31,164 --> 01:19:32,632
Don't take it personally.

1630
01:19:32,634 --> 01:19:34,200
I don't think I have the
strip club in me tonight.

1631
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:37,769
I'm just gonna get some ginger
ale and watch some pay-per-view.

1632
01:19:37,771 --> 01:19:40,141
I'll book us some flights
out for the morning.

1633
01:19:41,574 --> 01:19:44,276
A deal. We need a deal, right? A deal.

1634
01:19:44,278 --> 01:19:46,178
We need a deal we can afford.

1635
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:48,580
We need a deal that
they're not gonna refuse.

1636
01:19:48,582 --> 01:19:51,920
So... What can we do? We can...

1637
01:19:53,186 --> 01:19:56,187
The AA tranches. What if we
bet against the AA tranches?

1638
01:19:56,189 --> 01:19:58,257
Who's not gonna take that bet?

1639
01:19:58,259 --> 01:20:01,259
We know they say they're 95% AAA-rated,

1640
01:20:01,261 --> 01:20:03,329
but in reality they're more like 25%.

1641
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:05,831
Some of them are 0%!

1642
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:08,567
We also know that if the
bottom tranches fail at over 8%,

1643
01:20:08,569 --> 01:20:09,802
the upper tranches are affected.

1644
01:20:09,804 --> 01:20:11,269
They go to zero.

1645
01:20:11,271 --> 01:20:14,673
I'll bet you right now that
those AA's are actually like B's.

1646
01:20:14,675 --> 01:20:17,779
I rarely ever say these words,
but I think Charlie's right.

1647
01:20:18,112 --> 01:20:19,780
Look, Ben.

1648
01:20:21,448 --> 01:20:22,850
The payoff

1649
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:24,851
is 200 to 1.

1650
01:20:24,853 --> 01:20:27,018
But they're all taking
the ratings at face value.

1651
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:30,425
So they're charging pennies on
the dollar a bet against the AA's.

1652
01:20:32,025 --> 01:20:34,960
Just when I start thinking
you guys are clowns...

1653
01:20:34,962 --> 01:20:37,530
No one on the planet's
betting against AA's.

1654
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:40,532
The banks will think we're
either high or having a stroke.

1655
01:20:40,534 --> 01:20:42,871
They'll take every dime we have to offer.

1656
01:20:45,472 --> 01:20:46,807
Kinda brilliant.

1657
01:20:48,609 --> 01:20:50,742
This is what we did that
no one else thought of.

1658
01:20:50,744 --> 01:20:53,778
Not even Baum or Burry
thought to short the AA's.

1659
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:55,214
But we did.

1660
01:20:55,216 --> 01:20:57,083
Little Brownhole Capital.

1661
01:20:57,085 --> 01:21:02,088
We're interested in shorting
some of the AA tranche of CDOs.

1662
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:03,990
Come on, guys, what's the angle?

1663
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:06,392
Oh, got no angle. We're new
to this. We're just excited.

1664
01:21:06,394 --> 01:21:10,562
We want to do $15 million
in swaps on the AA tranche.

1665
01:21:10,564 --> 01:21:11,731
I don't understand.

1666
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:14,369
You can buy as much AA tranche as you want.

1667
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:18,771
$40 million against the AA.

1668
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:21,272
Brother, I will sell
you as much as you want.

1669
01:21:21,274 --> 01:21:23,510
You understand perfectly,
Bob. You want the deal?

1670
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,682
That's cool. That's all right with me.

1671
01:21:29,884 --> 01:21:31,086
Pleasure.

1672
01:21:35,922 --> 01:21:37,791
Oh!

1673
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:41,229
Don't do that. Stop. Stop.

1674
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:43,131
- Stop that.
- Charlie.

1675
01:21:43,864 --> 01:21:45,300
Stop it! Stop.

1676
01:21:47,734 --> 01:21:48,836
What?

1677
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:52,037
Do you have any idea what you just did?

1678
01:21:52,039 --> 01:21:53,772
Come on. We just made
the deal of our lifetimes!

1679
01:21:53,774 --> 01:21:55,040
We should celebrate.

1680
01:21:55,042 --> 01:21:57,041
You just bet against the American economy.

1681
01:21:57,043 --> 01:21:58,611
Fuck, yeah, we did!

1682
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:00,646
- Fuck, yeah!
- Which means...

1683
01:22:00,648 --> 01:22:04,383
Which means if we're right...

1684
01:22:04,385 --> 01:22:07,820
If we're right, people lose
homes. People lose jobs.

1685
01:22:07,822 --> 01:22:11,123
People lose retirement
savings. People lose pensions.

1686
01:22:11,125 --> 01:22:12,391
You know what I hate about fucking banking?

1687
01:22:12,393 --> 01:22:14,026
It reduces people to
numbers. Here's a number.

1688
01:22:14,028 --> 01:22:16,928
Every 1% unemployment goes up,
40,000 people die. Did you know that?

1689
01:22:16,930 --> 01:22:18,531
- No.
- Did you know that?

1690
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:20,101
No, I didn't know that.

1691
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:23,238
We were just excited.

1692
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:28,307
Just don't fucking dance.

1693
01:22:28,309 --> 01:22:30,145
- All right.
- Where are you going?

1694
01:22:34,515 --> 01:22:36,685
Whoa, I just got really scared.

1695
01:22:38,252 --> 01:22:40,251
First of all, great show today.

1696
01:22:40,253 --> 01:22:41,786
- You were terrific.
- Thank you.

1697
01:22:41,788 --> 01:22:43,488
Your big mouth was a revelation.

1698
01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:45,325
I appreciate that.

1699
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:47,159
You worried you and your
swaps are getting played?

1700
01:22:47,161 --> 01:22:48,827
Well, this is an opportunity for you

1701
01:22:48,829 --> 01:22:50,396
to meet who you're betting against.

1702
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:52,263
Try not to get too righteous
and listen a little.

1703
01:22:52,265 --> 01:22:53,766
Okay, fine. Who is this guy?

1704
01:22:53,768 --> 01:22:55,601
<i>A real solid-gold asshole.</i>

1705
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:56,803
I'm a CDO manager.

1706
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:57,936
A "CDO manager"?

1707
01:22:57,938 --> 01:22:59,938
Yeah, at Harding Advisors.

1708
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:03,043
I didn't realize that there was
anything to manage with CDOs.

1709
01:23:04,011 --> 01:23:05,777
Oh.

1710
01:23:05,779 --> 01:23:08,379
We select the securities
that go into the CDO portfolio

1711
01:23:08,381 --> 01:23:09,848
and monitor the assets.

1712
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:11,750
I do most of Merrill Lynch's CDOs.

1713
01:23:11,752 --> 01:23:14,786
Do you represent the
investors or Merrill Lynch?

1714
01:23:14,788 --> 01:23:15,888
The investors.

1715
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:17,022
You do.

1716
01:23:17,024 --> 01:23:18,557
- Yeah.
- But...

1717
01:23:18,559 --> 01:23:20,526
Merrill Lynch isn't gonna
send you any customers

1718
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:25,196
unless you put Merrill
Lynch's bonds in your CDO.

1719
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:28,534
Good question. Let's just
say Merrill and I have, um...

1720
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:30,768
We have a good relationship.

1721
01:23:30,770 --> 01:23:33,037
You have a good relationship
with Merrill Lynch.

1722
01:23:33,039 --> 01:23:34,807
We've been doing business
together for a long time.

1723
01:23:34,809 --> 01:23:37,376
And so the CDOs that you create

1724
01:23:37,378 --> 01:23:41,379
are of the highest quality
and the highest value.

1725
01:23:41,381 --> 01:23:43,382
- Absolutely. Yep.
- Absolutely.

1726
01:23:43,384 --> 01:23:46,921
Are you at all concerned
about the rising default rates?

1727
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:52,060
I assume no risk for these
products myself, Mark.

1728
01:23:54,729 --> 01:23:55,896
Okay.

1729
01:23:57,497 --> 01:24:01,233
So let me get this straight.
The bank calls you up.

1730
01:24:01,235 --> 01:24:02,867
They give you the bonds they want to sell.

1731
01:24:02,869 --> 01:24:04,268
They give you clients,

1732
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:06,738
they give you money to run your business.

1733
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:08,540
Give you fat fees for doing so.

1734
01:24:08,542 --> 01:24:10,809
But you represent the investors?

1735
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:13,245
Is that right?

1736
01:24:13,247 --> 01:24:14,379
Yeah.

1737
01:24:14,381 --> 01:24:15,915
But we're not in the
Merrill Lynch building.

1738
01:24:15,917 --> 01:24:17,583
- Okay. Where are you?
- We're in New Jersey.

1739
01:24:17,585 --> 01:24:19,750
You're 20 minutes away.

1740
01:24:19,752 --> 01:24:21,688
Well, five if you use a helicopter.

1741
01:24:23,556 --> 01:24:24,824
That's funny, huh?

1742
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:26,090
That's hilarious.

1743
01:24:29,195 --> 01:24:30,594
Oh, boy.

1744
01:24:30,596 --> 01:24:32,897
Your boss is about to explode.

1745
01:24:32,899 --> 01:24:34,599
No, he's too curious to explode.

1746
01:24:34,601 --> 01:24:36,168
Hold on. Say that again.

1747
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:38,370
CDO "A" has parts of CDO "B".

1748
01:24:38,372 --> 01:24:40,373
And CDO "B" has parts of CDO "A".

1749
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:42,708
But then they both get put inside CDO "C".

1750
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:44,543
Yeah, that one's called CDO squared.

1751
01:24:44,545 --> 01:24:46,614
A CDO of a CDO.

1752
01:24:47,047 --> 01:24:48,214
All right?

1753
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:50,249
And then there's CDOs made
up of the opposite side

1754
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:52,050
of the bet you made with your swaps.

1755
01:24:52,052 --> 01:24:54,452
We call them synthetic CDOs.

1756
01:24:54,454 --> 01:24:56,722
What did you say? Synthetic CDOs.

1757
01:24:56,724 --> 01:24:58,557
That is fucking crazy.

1758
01:24:58,559 --> 01:25:01,626
It's not. It's awesome.

1759
01:25:01,628 --> 01:25:05,132
His face is starting to boil. He looks
like the bad guy from <i>Dune.</i>

1760
01:25:09,235 --> 01:25:11,637
All right, let's say

1761
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:15,307
you have a pool of $50
million in subprime loans.

1762
01:25:15,309 --> 01:25:17,977
How much money could be
out there betting on it,

1763
01:25:17,979 --> 01:25:20,879
in your synthetic CDOs and swaps

1764
01:25:20,881 --> 01:25:22,548
right now, tonight?

1765
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:25,153
Let's see, $50 million... Hmm...

1766
01:25:26,153 --> 01:25:27,218
A billion dollars.

1767
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:29,321
What?

1768
01:25:29,323 --> 01:25:31,322
<i>If the mortgage bonds that
Michael Burry discovered</i>

1769
01:25:31,324 --> 01:25:32,659
<i>were the match...</i>

1770
01:25:34,095 --> 01:25:36,594
How much bigger is the market
for insuring mortgage bonds

1771
01:25:36,596 --> 01:25:38,032
than actual mortgages?

1772
01:25:39,233 --> 01:25:40,532
About 20 times.

1773
01:25:40,534 --> 01:25:42,701
<i>If the mortgage bonds were the match</i>

1774
01:25:42,703 --> 01:25:45,504
<i>and the CDOs were the
kerosene-soaked rags,</i>

1775
01:25:45,506 --> 01:25:47,638
<i>then the synthetic CDO
was the atomic bomb</i>

1776
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,441
<i>with the drunk President
holding his finger</i>

1777
01:25:49,443 --> 01:25:50,675
<i>over the button.</i>

1778
01:25:50,677 --> 01:25:53,012
<i>It was at that moment
in that dumb restaurant</i>

1779
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:56,281
<i>with that stupid look on his
face that Mark Baum realized</i>

1780
01:25:56,283 --> 01:25:58,686
<i>that the whole world
economy might collapse.</i>

1781
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:04,322
<i>And I know what you're thinking.</i>

1782
01:26:04,324 --> 01:26:06,758
<i>"What the fuck is a synthetic CDO?"</i>

1783
01:26:09,029 --> 01:26:12,763
<i>Well, here's Dr. Richard Thaler,
father of behavioral economics</i>

1784
01:26:12,765 --> 01:26:15,700
<i>and Selena Gomez to explain.</i>

1785
01:26:15,702 --> 01:26:18,970
Okay. So here's how a synthetic CDO works.

1786
01:26:18,972 --> 01:26:21,940
Let's say I bet $10
million on a blackjack hand.

1787
01:26:21,942 --> 01:26:24,809
$10 million because this
hand is meant to represent

1788
01:26:24,811 --> 01:26:27,047
a single mortgage bond.

1789
01:26:30,016 --> 01:26:33,552
Okay, Selena has a pretty
good hand here, showing 18.

1790
01:26:33,554 --> 01:26:34,652
Dealer showing seven.

1791
01:26:34,654 --> 01:26:36,787
That's a really good hand for Selena.

1792
01:26:36,789 --> 01:26:38,255
Good odds. In fact, her chances of winning

1793
01:26:38,257 --> 01:26:40,726
<i>this hand are 87%.</i>

1794
01:26:40,728 --> 01:26:44,196
So, my odds are good.
I'm on a winning streak.

1795
01:26:44,198 --> 01:26:46,932
Everybody in this place
wants to get in on the action.

1796
01:26:46,934 --> 01:26:48,400
How could I lose, right?

1797
01:26:48,402 --> 01:26:50,001
Now, this is a classic error.

1798
01:26:50,003 --> 01:26:53,037
In basketball it's called
the Hot Hand Fallacy.

1799
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:55,674
A player makes a bunch of shots in a row.

1800
01:26:55,676 --> 01:26:58,043
People are sure they're
gonna make the next one.

1801
01:26:58,045 --> 01:27:00,079
<i>People think that
whatever's happening now</i>

1802
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:02,915
<i>is gonna continue to
happen into the future.</i>

1803
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:06,352
<i>During the real estate boom,
markets were going up and up</i>

1804
01:27:06,354 --> 01:27:08,086
and people thought they
would never go down.

1805
01:27:08,088 --> 01:27:10,722
So people who are watching
and think that I won't lose

1806
01:27:10,724 --> 01:27:12,258
will make a side bet.

1807
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,593
Now, this is the first synthetic CDO.

1808
01:27:14,595 --> 01:27:16,260
I love Selena Gomez.

1809
01:27:16,262 --> 01:27:17,862
I bet you $50 million she wins.

1810
01:27:17,864 --> 01:27:20,031
And I'll give
you 3-to-1 odds.

1811
01:27:20,033 --> 01:27:23,936
3-to-1 odds? Okay,
I'll take that bet.

1812
01:27:23,938 --> 01:27:27,371
Now, somebody else is
gonna want to make a bet

1813
01:27:27,373 --> 01:27:28,639
on the outcome of their bet.

1814
01:27:28,641 --> 01:27:29,875
Bet you 50 million she wins.

1815
01:27:29,877 --> 01:27:32,910
That will lead to synthetic CDO number two.

1816
01:27:32,912 --> 01:27:36,248
Hey, I bet you $200 million
that lady in the glasses

1817
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:37,916
wins that bet.

1818
01:27:37,918 --> 01:27:41,152
She probably will win.
So I want a great payoff.

1819
01:27:41,154 --> 01:27:42,388
How about
20-to-1?

1820
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:43,923
Deal.

1821
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:48,226
And this will go on and on with
more and more synthetic CDOs.

1822
01:27:48,228 --> 01:27:52,429
And we can transform an
original $10 million investment

1823
01:27:52,431 --> 01:27:54,335
into billions of dollars.

1824
01:27:55,269 --> 01:27:56,604
You okay?

1825
01:27:58,005 --> 01:27:59,007
No.

1826
01:28:00,408 --> 01:28:02,243
I actually feel pretty sick.

1827
01:28:07,448 --> 01:28:09,350
So I'm going to leave.

1828
01:28:10,951 --> 01:28:13,919
You think I'm a parasite,
don't you, Mr. Baum?

1829
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:17,825
But, apparently, society
values me very much.

1830
01:28:18,859 --> 01:28:20,628
In fact, let's do this.

1831
01:28:22,662 --> 01:28:26,231
I'll tell you how much I'm worth.

1832
01:28:26,233 --> 01:28:27,702
You tell me how much you're worth.

1833
01:28:28,935 --> 01:28:34,007
God, you are an incredibly
big piece of shit.

1834
01:28:39,779 --> 01:28:41,713
Short everything that guy has touched.

1835
01:28:41,715 --> 01:28:43,883
I want half a billion more in swaps.

1836
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:46,184
You sure about that? The
collateral calls could bankrupt you.

1837
01:28:46,186 --> 01:28:47,253
Yeah. Yeah.

1838
01:28:47,255 --> 01:28:48,320
Where are you going?

1839
01:28:48,322 --> 01:28:51,423
I am going to try to find moral redemption

1840
01:28:51,425 --> 01:28:53,226
at the roulette table.

1841
01:29:57,423 --> 01:29:58,826
Hey, hey, hey!

1842
01:30:02,896 --> 01:30:04,364
Things are worse than I thought.

1843
01:30:06,466 --> 01:30:08,799
I honestly think the
economy might collapse.

1844
01:30:08,801 --> 01:30:10,035
But you've been saying

1845
01:30:10,037 --> 01:30:13,571
that the system's broken
for years, Mark. So...

1846
01:30:13,573 --> 01:30:15,475
Why are you so shocked?

1847
01:30:17,978 --> 01:30:21,513
It's more twisted than
I could have imagined.

1848
01:30:21,515 --> 01:30:23,816
You love to be the virtuous one.

1849
01:30:23,818 --> 01:30:25,483
I'm a banker. I'm a part of it.

1850
01:30:25,485 --> 01:30:27,885
You always have, Mark.
Like you're untainted.

1851
01:30:27,887 --> 01:30:31,924
It changed me. It changed me into a person

1852
01:30:31,926 --> 01:30:33,857
who is not able to reach out to someone...

1853
01:30:33,859 --> 01:30:36,327
He was in pain. My
brother was in real pain.

1854
01:30:36,329 --> 01:30:38,698
There's no perfect way to help.

1855
01:30:41,702 --> 01:30:44,269
It's sad. It's scary.

1856
01:30:44,271 --> 01:30:47,540
So stop trying to fix the world.

1857
01:30:47,542 --> 01:30:48,674
He told me...

1858
01:30:48,676 --> 01:30:50,108
You're not a saint.

1859
01:30:50,110 --> 01:30:52,076
Saints don't live on Park Avenue.

1860
01:30:52,078 --> 01:30:53,778
...that he was having bad thoughts.

1861
01:30:53,780 --> 01:30:56,915
Just feel the feelings like the rest of us.

1862
01:30:56,917 --> 01:31:01,419
<i>My first response was
to offer him some money.</i>

1863
01:31:01,421 --> 01:31:04,322
<i>I offered him fucking money!</i>

1864
01:31:09,595 --> 01:31:12,199
His face was so smashed.

1865
01:31:31,284 --> 01:31:32,619
That's right.

1866
01:32:39,319 --> 01:32:40,718
Michael?

1867
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,153
- Michael?
- Yes. Yes.

1868
01:32:42,155 --> 01:32:43,254
Is everything okay?

1869
01:32:43,256 --> 01:32:44,322
Yes, honey.

1870
01:32:44,324 --> 01:32:45,389
You sure?

1871
01:32:45,391 --> 01:32:46,426
Yeah, baby.

1872
01:32:48,228 --> 01:32:49,529
I'm fine.

1873
01:32:58,506 --> 01:33:00,237
<i>To all investors.</i>

1874
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:02,340
<i>As you may know,</i>

1875
01:33:02,342 --> 01:33:06,378
<i>our agreement allows me to
take extraordinary measures</i>

1876
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:09,380
<i>when markets aren't
functioning properly.</i>

1877
01:33:09,382 --> 01:33:13,086
<i>I currently have reason to
believe the mortgage bond market</i>

1878
01:33:13,753 --> 01:33:15,523
<i>is fraudulent.</i>

1879
01:33:17,690 --> 01:33:22,527
<i>So, in order to protect investors
from this fraudulent market,</i>

1880
01:33:22,529 --> 01:33:25,830
<i>I've decided to restrict
investors' withdrawals</i>

1881
01:33:25,832 --> 01:33:27,866
<i>until further notice.</i>

1882
01:33:27,868 --> 01:33:31,539
<i>Sincerely, Dr. Michael J. Burry.</i>

1883
01:34:39,072 --> 01:34:40,705
<i>I never would have guessed my life</i>

1884
01:34:40,707 --> 01:34:43,342
<i>could change as much as it
has since I moved to L.A.</i>

1885
01:34:43,344 --> 01:34:45,809
<i>It's not just, like, that
easy to, like, not see you.</i>

1886
01:34:45,811 --> 01:34:49,113
<i>He lashed out at rumors he used
performance enhancing drugs.</i>

1887
01:34:49,115 --> 01:34:50,615
This record is not tainted.

1888
01:34:50,617 --> 01:34:51,848
Oh, my God, dude.

1889
01:34:51,850 --> 01:34:53,652
Will you please stop changing the channels?

1890
01:34:53,654 --> 01:34:55,352
- You're driving me crazy.
- All right.

1891
01:34:55,354 --> 01:34:58,255
- Fine.
- Just put the business news on.

1892
01:34:58,257 --> 01:34:59,523
<i>...and the S&P picked
up three points.</i>

1893
01:34:59,525 --> 01:35:00,592
Jesus!

1894
01:35:00,594 --> 01:35:02,460
<i>Mortgage meltdown continued today.</i>

1895
01:35:02,462 --> 01:35:05,263
<i>Subprime mortgage lender
New Century Financial,</i>

1896
01:35:05,265 --> 01:35:08,000
<i>once the industry leader, by
the way, filed for bankruptcy.</i>

1897
01:35:08,002 --> 01:35:09,166
- <i>The company immediately...</i>
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1898
01:35:10,537 --> 01:35:11,768
<i>Good time for my voice to go...</i>

1899
01:35:11,770 --> 01:35:14,138
<i>Fired 3,200 workers.</i>

1900
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:16,541
<i>The manufacturing index also
fell in the month of March...</i>

1901
01:35:16,543 --> 01:35:17,775
It's starting.

1902
01:35:17,777 --> 01:35:19,378
<i>...a warning that economic
growth could slow.</i>

1903
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:20,978
<i>The Institute of Supply Management</i>

1904
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:22,479
<i>also reported a rise in prices...</i>

1905
01:35:22,481 --> 01:35:24,085
I'm gonna call my mom.

1906
01:35:26,353 --> 01:35:29,286
<i>The principal source of the
slowdown in economic growth...</i>

1907
01:35:29,288 --> 01:35:31,456
Time and time and time again,

1908
01:35:31,458 --> 01:35:33,692
I have gone to bat for you, Mark!

1909
01:35:33,694 --> 01:35:35,058
We've known each other for seven years...

1910
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:37,398
She's got some lungs on her. I'm impressed.

1911
01:35:38,564 --> 01:35:41,299
I can't help but enjoy it.

1912
01:35:41,301 --> 01:35:43,034
There's no fucking way.
There's no fucking way

1913
01:35:43,036 --> 01:35:44,505
that the big banks are that stupid.

1914
01:35:45,505 --> 01:35:47,341
Bye, Kathy!

1915
01:35:52,011 --> 01:35:54,211
Well?

1916
01:35:54,213 --> 01:35:57,915
Kathy thinks that it would be a
good idea if we sold our shorts.

1917
01:35:57,917 --> 01:35:59,049
What else is new?

1918
01:35:59,051 --> 01:36:00,951
And she said that Morgan
Stanley will buy them.

1919
01:36:00,953 --> 01:36:01,956
Holy shit!

1920
01:36:02,689 --> 01:36:04,022
What did you say?

1921
01:36:04,024 --> 01:36:05,659
I told her we're not selling shit.

1922
01:36:11,864 --> 01:36:15,834
Uh, if you need the files for 2005...

1923
01:36:15,836 --> 01:36:19,603
Mr. Fields' suit is very specific
to files from the past year.

1924
01:36:19,605 --> 01:36:22,440
Good. Then get out. Say
hi to Lawrence for me.

1925
01:36:22,442 --> 01:36:23,808
Will do.

1926
01:36:26,645 --> 01:36:28,412
You can't call me back for a week?

1927
01:36:28,414 --> 01:36:30,615
<i>I am so sorry, Mike.</i>

1928
01:36:30,617 --> 01:36:33,884
<i>Goldman had a systems failure.
I lost a ton of messages.</i>

1929
01:36:33,886 --> 01:36:36,021
Yeah, B of A said they had a power outage,

1930
01:36:36,023 --> 01:36:39,324
and Morgan Stanley said
their server crashed.

1931
01:36:39,326 --> 01:36:40,558
<i>Huh. That's weird.</i>

1932
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:43,160
Well, I would call it improbable.

1933
01:36:43,162 --> 01:36:46,733
So where do you have our position marked?

1934
01:36:47,568 --> 01:36:49,400
<i>I think it's the same, Mike.</i>

1935
01:36:49,402 --> 01:36:51,335
What? Can you explain that to me, please,

1936
01:36:51,337 --> 01:36:54,740
because how can the value
of an insurance contract

1937
01:36:54,742 --> 01:36:59,009
not be affected by the demise
of the very thing it insures?

1938
01:36:59,011 --> 01:37:01,912
<i>They're independent markets.
They're not always correlated.</i>

1939
01:37:01,914 --> 01:37:02,981
<i>I know it sounds odd,</i>

1940
01:37:02,983 --> 01:37:05,452
<i>but these are very
complicated products.</i>

1941
01:37:06,286 --> 01:37:08,253
They are correlated.

1942
01:37:08,255 --> 01:37:10,321
They're gonna lose their houses,
they're gonna lose their jobs,

1943
01:37:10,323 --> 01:37:11,325
they're gonna lose their...

1944
01:37:14,194 --> 01:37:16,259
Will you listen to me?

1945
01:37:16,261 --> 01:37:18,995
This is like the end of capitalism.

1946
01:37:18,997 --> 01:37:22,335
This is like the Dark Ages all over again.

1947
01:37:23,369 --> 01:37:24,602
I don't want to talk to Dad.

1948
01:37:24,604 --> 01:37:27,839
Okay, I love you, too. Save your money.

1949
01:37:27,841 --> 01:37:32,009
She says I need to be on Xanax
and double my dose of Zoloft.

1950
01:37:32,011 --> 01:37:34,044
I asked Bear Stearns to price our shorts.

1951
01:37:34,046 --> 01:37:35,714
They tell me the CDOs still haven't moved.

1952
01:37:35,716 --> 01:37:37,581
This is fucking insane!

1953
01:37:37,583 --> 01:37:39,183
You realize that? These people are crooks

1954
01:37:39,185 --> 01:37:41,385
and they should be in prison.

1955
01:37:41,387 --> 01:37:42,620
Look at the TABX.

1956
01:37:42,622 --> 01:37:44,522
You can see that the CDOs are worth zero!

1957
01:37:44,524 --> 01:37:45,656
So you know what they're doing, huh?

1958
01:37:45,658 --> 01:37:46,824
You know what they're doing, right?

1959
01:37:46,826 --> 01:37:48,558
Yeah. They're unloading them.

1960
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:51,963
They're selling their dog shit
CDOs, then they go to another bank

1961
01:37:51,965 --> 01:37:54,165
and short the shit they just fucking sold!

1962
01:37:54,167 --> 01:37:55,834
Let's go to the press, man!

1963
01:37:55,836 --> 01:37:59,106
This is a massive story.
Who wouldn't publish it?

1964
01:38:00,073 --> 01:38:01,839
Robert Redford!

1965
01:38:01,841 --> 01:38:03,375
No, you don't understand!

1966
01:38:03,377 --> 01:38:04,912
I got it, guys. I got it.

1967
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:08,345
What am I supposed to do?

1968
01:38:08,347 --> 01:38:10,113
Do you want me to write a
piece called "We're All Fucked"?

1969
01:38:10,115 --> 01:38:12,083
Yes! That's a perfect title!

1970
01:38:12,085 --> 01:38:16,420
Casey, right now every bank in
town is unloading these shit bonds

1971
01:38:16,422 --> 01:38:18,223
onto unsuspecting customers.

1972
01:38:18,225 --> 01:38:21,326
And they won't devalue them until
they get them off their books.

1973
01:38:21,328 --> 01:38:23,861
This level of criminality is unprecedented,

1974
01:38:23,863 --> 01:38:27,232
even on fucking Wall Street.

1975
01:38:27,234 --> 01:38:30,367
Jamie... And this is me
being honest here, okay?

1976
01:38:30,369 --> 01:38:33,004
It took me years to build my
relationships on Wall Street.

1977
01:38:33,006 --> 01:38:37,241
No bank or ratings agency is
going to confirm a story like this

1978
01:38:37,243 --> 01:38:39,876
just because it comes from two guys in a...

1979
01:38:39,878 --> 01:38:43,281
Sorry, garage band hedge fund
that thinks it's the apocalypse.

1980
01:38:44,784 --> 01:38:45,950
Wow.

1981
01:38:45,952 --> 01:38:47,352
I thought you were for real, Casey.

1982
01:38:47,354 --> 01:38:48,887
You know, I'll have to say I really did.

1983
01:38:48,889 --> 01:38:50,254
Really?

1984
01:38:50,256 --> 01:38:52,290
Yeah, Jamie, you try being
for real with a three-year-old

1985
01:38:52,292 --> 01:38:54,392
and a wife getting her master's degree.

1986
01:38:54,394 --> 01:38:57,731
I'm not gonna burn my
reputation on your wild hunch.

1987
01:38:58,564 --> 01:38:59,897
Wow.

1988
01:38:59,899 --> 01:39:01,232
Wow.

1989
01:39:01,234 --> 01:39:02,366
Thanks for coming, guys.

1990
01:39:02,368 --> 01:39:03,601
Totally fucking awesome to see you.

1991
01:39:03,603 --> 01:39:05,736
Yeah, Casey. I've always hated you,

1992
01:39:05,738 --> 01:39:07,805
because you were a prick in college

1993
01:39:07,807 --> 01:39:10,607
and you are a prick today!

1994
01:39:10,609 --> 01:39:13,644
Thanks, Charlie. Still
living with your mom?

1995
01:39:13,646 --> 01:39:15,213
Charlie, come on!

1996
01:39:15,215 --> 01:39:17,714
Mark Baum again. Call me.

1997
01:39:17,716 --> 01:39:19,416
Subprime bonds fell off a cliff.

1998
01:39:19,418 --> 01:39:21,451
Rumor has it the default numbers are huge.

1999
01:39:21,453 --> 01:39:24,321
Who got the remittance data
early? I bet it's Goldman.

2000
01:39:24,323 --> 01:39:25,757
Yeah, fuck you very much.

2001
01:39:25,759 --> 01:39:28,994
Jared, it's chaos down here. Where are we?

2002
01:39:28,996 --> 01:39:32,231
"And Caesar wept, for there
were no more worlds to conquer."

2003
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,069
Shane?

2004
01:39:35,435 --> 01:39:36,670
Shane?

2005
01:39:38,270 --> 01:39:41,039
Well, nobody's buying CDO
or mortgage bonds anymore

2006
01:39:41,041 --> 01:39:42,673
and everybody wants swaps.

2007
01:39:42,675 --> 01:39:45,110
<i>Swaps are now the most
popular product on the street.</i>

2008
01:39:45,112 --> 01:39:47,012
- That's good for us.
- <i>Yes and no.</i>

2009
01:39:47,014 --> 01:39:48,513
I heard from somebody
who heard from somebody...

2010
01:39:48,515 --> 01:39:51,251
No, Alex, no. Sorry.

2011
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:56,320
Bennie Cleager over at Morgan is taking on

2012
01:39:56,322 --> 01:39:57,925
<i>some heavy losses in
the bond department.</i>

2013
01:39:59,426 --> 01:40:01,459
<i>Your ship might be taking on water.</i>

2014
01:40:01,461 --> 01:40:03,797
<i>It might be time to get
our lifejacket and get out.</i>

2015
01:40:04,530 --> 01:40:06,598
<i>I'm jacked.</i>

2016
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:09,069
I'm jacked! I'm jacked to the tits!

2017
01:40:09,703 --> 01:40:10,835
Good.

2018
01:40:10,837 --> 01:40:12,906
- <i>Do you feel it?</i>
- No.

2019
01:40:19,112 --> 01:40:20,547
What'd you hear, Tommy?

2020
01:40:22,716 --> 01:40:23,815
It's happening.

2021
01:40:23,817 --> 01:40:25,851
Everybody wants our swaps.

2022
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:28,186
Kathy's office is looking for you.

2023
01:40:28,188 --> 01:40:30,623
They're singing a different
tune now, aren't they?

2024
01:40:31,957 --> 01:40:33,460
That's not good.

2025
01:40:38,297 --> 01:40:39,731
Maybe later. Not now.

2026
01:40:39,733 --> 01:40:42,267
This is a joke. Never.

2027
01:40:45,639 --> 01:40:47,138
Listening.

2028
01:40:47,140 --> 01:40:48,807
- <i>Dr. Burry?</i>
- Yeah.

2029
01:40:48,809 --> 01:40:50,308
<i>Deeb Winston, Goldman Sachs.</i>

2030
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:51,875
<i>Listen, I've been
reviewing your position.</i>

2031
01:40:51,877 --> 01:40:54,211
<i>I wanted to discuss your marks
and make sure they're fair.</i>

2032
01:40:54,213 --> 01:40:57,115
Yeah, I think you mean that you've

2033
01:40:57,117 --> 01:41:00,052
secured a net short position yourselves.

2034
01:41:00,054 --> 01:41:02,986
So you're free to mark my
swaps accurately for once

2035
01:41:02,988 --> 01:41:05,658
because it's now in your interest to do so.

2036
01:41:07,827 --> 01:41:10,061
<i>I'm not sure what
you want me to say.</i>

2037
01:41:10,063 --> 01:41:11,565
I think that...

2038
01:41:13,065 --> 01:41:15,168
I think that you've already said it.

2039
01:41:23,010 --> 01:41:25,209
You tell Jeff at Goldman that
I'm not transferring funds.

2040
01:41:25,211 --> 01:41:26,847
This is bullshit!

2041
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:35,756
Okay, we'll talk later.

2042
01:41:36,256 --> 01:41:37,691
Thank you.

2043
01:41:40,193 --> 01:41:42,126
Thanks for coming so quickly, Mark.

2044
01:41:42,128 --> 01:41:43,760
- Yeah.
- Um...

2045
01:41:43,762 --> 01:41:45,095
I know you've been hearing rumblings

2046
01:41:45,097 --> 01:41:46,696
about some losses Morgan has suffered.

2047
01:41:46,698 --> 01:41:48,634
- Congratulations.
- On what?

2048
01:41:49,268 --> 01:41:50,304
Oh.

2049
01:41:51,037 --> 01:41:52,602
Thanks. Um...

2050
01:41:52,604 --> 01:41:53,940
Having fun?

2051
01:41:54,975 --> 01:41:56,310
Yes.

2052
01:41:57,543 --> 01:41:59,376
Tons. Um...

2053
01:41:59,378 --> 01:42:02,280
I just wanted you to know that, um...

2054
01:42:02,282 --> 01:42:04,048
That, yes, Morgan has suffered some losses,

2055
01:42:04,050 --> 01:42:08,052
but our liquidity is strong and
there's no cause for concern.

2056
01:42:08,054 --> 01:42:11,222
Would Bennie Cleager be concerned?

2057
01:42:11,224 --> 01:42:12,623
Because word on the street

2058
01:42:12,625 --> 01:42:15,462
is that he took some pretty heavy losses.

2059
01:42:16,796 --> 01:42:18,662
Kathy, come on. We know each other.

2060
01:42:18,664 --> 01:42:21,299
What's going on?

2061
01:42:21,301 --> 01:42:22,967
How bad is this?

2062
01:42:22,969 --> 01:42:24,936
Okay.

2063
01:42:24,938 --> 01:42:28,072
Two years ago, Bennie Cleager
in Morgan's bond department

2064
01:42:28,074 --> 01:42:31,675
also started shorting subprime
housing, $2 billion in BBBs.

2065
01:42:31,677 --> 01:42:33,009
Bennie is smarter than I thought.

2066
01:42:33,011 --> 01:42:34,513
No, he's not smart at all.

2067
01:42:34,515 --> 01:42:36,981
The premiums on the swap
ate into his desk's profit.

2068
01:42:36,983 --> 01:42:39,016
To cover his BBB shorts,

2069
01:42:39,018 --> 01:42:41,619
he sold a lot of A and
AA swaps as protection.

2070
01:42:41,621 --> 01:42:43,321
A lot.

2071
01:42:43,323 --> 01:42:47,090
He believed that there was no
way that they could be affected.

2072
01:42:47,092 --> 01:42:50,430
Tell me Morgan Stanley doesn't
hold the contracts on these swaps.

2073
01:42:53,766 --> 01:42:55,933
Holy shit.

2074
01:42:55,935 --> 01:42:59,602
All this time I've been trying to
figure out who I'm betting against,

2075
01:42:59,604 --> 01:43:01,440
and it's Morgan Stanley.

2076
01:43:02,375 --> 01:43:03,710
Which is me.

2077
01:43:05,444 --> 01:43:08,678
What's your exposure? $3 billion?

2078
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:10,682
Please, don't tell me it's more than four.

2079
01:43:10,684 --> 01:43:12,384
I can't answer that. I can't answer that.

2080
01:43:12,386 --> 01:43:15,652
Yes, you can answer that,
because I walk in here

2081
01:43:15,654 --> 01:43:18,724
and people are crying in your hallway.

2082
01:43:19,125 --> 01:43:20,791
Kathy,

2083
01:43:20,793 --> 01:43:22,893
you bring me in to tell
me everything's fine,

2084
01:43:22,895 --> 01:43:24,131
and everything's not fine.

2085
01:43:24,764 --> 01:43:26,667
What, what is happening?

2086
01:43:28,868 --> 01:43:31,038
The long exposure is...

2087
01:43:32,971 --> 01:43:34,474
...$15 billion.

2088
01:43:40,412 --> 01:43:41,646
Jesus!

2089
01:43:41,648 --> 01:43:44,080
He kept saying defaults
over 8% were impossible.

2090
01:43:44,082 --> 01:43:45,182
Oh, my God.

2091
01:43:45,184 --> 01:43:46,386
That there would be a million homeless!

2092
01:43:47,854 --> 01:43:50,090
Yeah, but we have nothing
to do with Morgan Stanley.

2093
01:43:53,024 --> 01:43:54,491
Yeah...

2094
01:43:54,493 --> 01:43:56,561
Tell the bankruptcy court.

2095
01:43:56,563 --> 01:43:59,699
Morgan fails, all our accounts
go on their balance sheet.

2096
01:44:00,332 --> 01:44:02,133
It's just crazy.

2097
01:44:02,135 --> 01:44:03,567
Morgan makes the sucker's bet

2098
01:44:03,569 --> 01:44:06,403
and we pay their fucking gambling debt?

2099
01:44:06,405 --> 01:44:08,908
Short the bank stocks. Then we wait.

2100
01:44:12,845 --> 01:44:14,847
Or we sell our swaps when the market opens.

2101
01:44:16,582 --> 01:44:19,718
We get our bonuses, our investors
get their profits, we get...

2102
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:22,519
What, 30 cents on the dollar? It's not bad.

2103
01:44:22,521 --> 01:44:24,089
We're three times that.

2104
01:44:24,091 --> 01:44:25,889
Not if there's no market
left to sell them in.

2105
01:44:25,891 --> 01:44:27,892
Forget it. We're not
giving out any lifeboats.

2106
01:44:27,894 --> 01:44:30,327
If Morgan goes under,
we end up with nothing.

2107
01:44:30,329 --> 01:44:31,331
Vinnie.

2108
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:36,270
Jesus, come on. I say when we sell.

2109
01:44:40,405 --> 01:44:42,874
Look, I get that this is personal for you,

2110
01:44:42,876 --> 01:44:45,242
but we have a fiduciary responsibility.

2111
01:44:45,244 --> 01:44:47,010
No. No, we don't.

2112
01:44:47,012 --> 01:44:49,380
Nobody's acting responsible.

2113
01:44:49,382 --> 01:44:52,616
Fuck responsibility. Are you kidding me?

2114
01:44:52,618 --> 01:44:54,785
The assholes at the big banks will take...

2115
01:44:54,787 --> 01:44:55,919
You boys want any appetizers?

2116
01:44:55,921 --> 01:44:57,657
We're talking, please!

2117
01:44:58,423 --> 01:44:59,926
- Excuse us.
- Sorry.

2118
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:04,963
We are going to wait,
and we are going to wait,

2119
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:06,629
and we are going to wait

2120
01:45:06,631 --> 01:45:10,735
until they feel the pain,
until they start to bleed.

2121
01:45:10,737 --> 01:45:12,937
- That is what I want.
- But what about our clients

2122
01:45:12,939 --> 01:45:14,304
who've entrusted us with their savings...

2123
01:45:14,306 --> 01:45:15,572
I say when we sell.

2124
01:45:15,574 --> 01:45:16,674
This isn't about you.

2125
01:45:16,676 --> 01:45:18,009
This isn't about you
and your Upper East Side

2126
01:45:18,011 --> 01:45:19,242
- mahogany soapbox.
- Hey! Hey!

2127
01:45:19,244 --> 01:45:20,579
I say when we sell!

2128
01:45:22,148 --> 01:45:23,917
Whatever you say, Mark.

2129
01:45:30,622 --> 01:45:32,391
Dude, did you hear the news?

2130
01:45:34,261 --> 01:45:36,660
Okay. So, not only do
two mortgage hedge funds

2131
01:45:36,662 --> 01:45:38,528
<i>backed by Bear Stearns go belly up,</i>

2132
01:45:38,530 --> 01:45:41,732
but now there's a class-action
lawsuit against Bear.

2133
01:45:41,734 --> 01:45:43,000
Holy shit!

2134
01:45:43,002 --> 01:45:45,602
Let's go! Push! Push!

2135
01:45:45,604 --> 01:45:47,103
So, what? Bear could really collapse here.

2136
01:45:47,105 --> 01:45:48,973
- This is a risk we really shouldn't take.
- <i>Then what?</i>

2137
01:45:48,975 --> 01:45:51,040
<i>We bought 80% of our swaps at Bear.</i>

2138
01:45:51,042 --> 01:45:52,710
- <i>We'd lose everything.</i>
- So what?

2139
01:45:52,712 --> 01:45:54,245
- Hey, sir?
- One second!

2140
01:45:54,247 --> 01:45:55,312
That's my opinion.

2141
01:45:55,314 --> 01:45:56,613
We bought these fucking things.

2142
01:45:56,615 --> 01:45:57,848
We have no clue how to sell them.

2143
01:45:57,850 --> 01:45:59,349
I know. We have to get Ben to do it.

2144
01:45:59,351 --> 01:46:01,419
I've been trying to call him
and he won't get back to me.

2145
01:46:01,421 --> 01:46:03,787
No. He's on vacation
with his wife's family.

2146
01:46:03,789 --> 01:46:04,957
They're in England.

2147
01:46:05,890 --> 01:46:07,025
What?

2148
01:46:14,634 --> 01:46:16,299
- <i>Hello, Ben. Hey.</i>
- Guys?

2149
01:46:16,301 --> 01:46:17,968
<i>Yeah, we're here. Can you hear us?</i>

2150
01:46:17,970 --> 01:46:19,637
- Guys?
- <i>Yeah, we got you.</i>

2151
01:46:19,639 --> 01:46:23,574
<i>Yeah. I hardly got cell
phone or Wi-Fi service.</i>

2152
01:46:23,576 --> 01:46:26,509
I'm trying to sell $200
million worth of securities.

2153
01:46:26,511 --> 01:46:29,147
In a pub. It smells like sheep.

2154
01:46:29,149 --> 01:46:30,248
You can do this.

2155
01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:31,616
<i>I don't want to pressure you, Ben</i>

2156
01:46:31,618 --> 01:46:34,318
<i>but if you don't pull this
off, we lose everything.</i>

2157
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:37,591
All right. Let's see what
Credit Suisse's appetite is.

2158
01:46:42,761 --> 01:46:44,027
This is Brownfield Fund.

2159
01:46:44,029 --> 01:46:46,263
I want to unload my credit default swaps.

2160
01:46:46,265 --> 01:46:47,999
<i>All right. What you got?</i>

2161
01:46:48,001 --> 01:46:50,267
Twenty AA tranches of A.B.S. CDOs.

2162
01:46:50,269 --> 01:46:52,836
<i>A.B.S.? Are these...
These are pretty bad?</i>

2163
01:46:52,838 --> 01:46:55,106
Absolutely. They're complete shit.

2164
01:46:55,108 --> 01:46:56,706
<i>What's your notional value?</i>

2165
01:46:56,708 --> 01:46:59,677
Face value is 205 million. Dollars.

2166
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:02,312
<i>All right, we could,
we could go to forty.</i>

2167
01:47:02,314 --> 01:47:03,714
No. We want at least 100 million.

2168
01:47:03,716 --> 01:47:07,518
100 million? Who are you,
a drug dealer or a banker?

2169
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:10,086
'Cause if you're a banker,
you can fuck right off!

2170
01:47:10,088 --> 01:47:11,356
<i>I don't know if we
can make a market.</i>

2171
01:47:11,358 --> 01:47:12,555
Just give me your best price?

2172
01:47:12,557 --> 01:47:15,192
Yeah. Chuck 100 million in for me, mate.

2173
01:47:15,194 --> 01:47:16,927
<i>I think we're far apart.</i>

2174
01:47:16,929 --> 01:47:19,365
Look, if you don't want the
deal, you can just hang up.

2175
01:47:21,801 --> 01:47:23,370
That's what I thought.

2176
01:47:24,136 --> 01:47:26,139
- 90 million.
- <i>70.</i>

2177
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:29,205
85.

2178
01:47:29,207 --> 01:47:31,143
- <i>78.</i>
- 84.

2179
01:47:32,377 --> 01:47:34,380
- <i>78.</i>
- 84.

2180
01:47:36,181 --> 01:47:38,081
It's Dr. Burry.

2181
01:47:38,083 --> 01:47:40,921
Looks like the collapse of the
financial sector is imminent.

2182
01:47:41,921 --> 01:47:44,254
Let's start to sell my position.

2183
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:46,091
It's $1.3 billion.

2184
01:47:47,594 --> 01:47:49,429
Sure, I'll hold.

2185
01:48:13,252 --> 01:48:15,586
So, I was right.

2186
01:48:15,588 --> 01:48:18,488
I took a rash of shit for two years, but

2187
01:48:18,490 --> 01:48:20,758
I was right.

2188
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:23,427
And everyone was wrong.

2189
01:48:23,429 --> 01:48:26,600
And, yeah, I got a bonus
check for it. Sue me.

2190
01:48:27,266 --> 01:48:28,766
You know?

2191
01:48:28,768 --> 01:48:32,468
It's a lot of money. I get
it. I can feel you judging me.

2192
01:48:32,470 --> 01:48:34,472
That's palpable.

2193
01:48:34,474 --> 01:48:39,076
But, hey, I never said I
was the hero of this story.

2194
01:48:39,078 --> 01:48:41,648
Hey, Ben. How are we looking?

2195
01:48:42,847 --> 01:48:44,184
<i>Eight... on...</i>

2196
01:48:44,917 --> 01:48:46,650
Sorry?

2197
01:48:46,652 --> 01:48:48,986
No. Eighty million.

2198
01:48:48,988 --> 01:48:50,687
$80 million, $80 million,
that's good, right?

2199
01:48:50,689 --> 01:48:51,854
- Eighty is great.
- Is that good?

2200
01:48:51,856 --> 01:48:53,124
- Eighty is great, Ben.
- Okay.

2201
01:48:53,126 --> 01:48:55,793
Thank you. Thank you so much.

2202
01:48:55,795 --> 01:48:57,762
<i>Most of it went to UBS.</i>

2203
01:48:57,764 --> 01:48:59,630
<i>You're very lucky. The largest bank</i>

2204
01:48:59,632 --> 01:49:02,732
in France froze customer's
money market accounts today.

2205
01:49:02,734 --> 01:49:04,369
This thing's hitting Europe.

2206
01:49:04,371 --> 01:49:06,269
Greece and Iceland are finished.

2207
01:49:06,271 --> 01:49:07,705
Spain is teetering.

2208
01:49:07,707 --> 01:49:09,706
Are you serious? Fuck.

2209
01:49:09,708 --> 01:49:11,607
<i>Ben, call us when you get home.</i>

2210
01:49:11,609 --> 01:49:13,009
<i>But, hey, before you go,</i>

2211
01:49:13,011 --> 01:49:15,047
uh, I'm just wondering...

2212
01:49:15,713 --> 01:49:16,983
Um...

2213
01:49:18,117 --> 01:49:20,186
Why did you do this with us?

2214
01:49:21,154 --> 01:49:23,486
<i>You didn't have to. Uh...</i>

2215
01:49:23,488 --> 01:49:28,058
<i>Thank you. But, uh, why?</i>

2216
01:49:28,060 --> 01:49:31,528
You guys said you wanted to
get rich. Now you're rich.

2217
01:49:31,530 --> 01:49:32,696
<i>Goal!</i>

2218
01:49:32,698 --> 01:49:34,534
<i>Pamplona puts themselves
on the scoreboard.</i>

2219
01:49:38,503 --> 01:49:41,104
<i>As the housing markets and
banks continued to hemorrhage,</i>

2220
01:49:41,106 --> 01:49:43,607
<i>only one of the big
shorts refused to sell.</i>

2221
01:49:43,609 --> 01:49:44,811
<i>Mark Baum.</i>

2222
01:49:48,213 --> 01:49:50,313
<i>So it was beyond perfect
when he was asked to speak</i>

2223
01:49:50,315 --> 01:49:52,250
<i>at a conference
opposite Bruce Miller,</i>

2224
01:49:52,252 --> 01:49:55,085
<i>the famous bullish investor.</i>

2225
01:49:55,087 --> 01:49:57,388
<i>After he and Mark had their
debate, Alan Greenspan,</i>

2226
01:49:57,390 --> 01:50:01,090
<i>one of the architects of the whole
crisis was scheduled to speak.</i>

2227
01:50:01,092 --> 01:50:04,094
<i>Everyone in Mark's office showed
up, he even invited friends.</i>

2228
01:50:05,364 --> 01:50:08,833
<i>This was the Ali vs. Foreman
of the financial world.</i>

2229
01:50:08,835 --> 01:50:11,302
<i>The realist versus the fools.</i>

2230
01:50:11,304 --> 01:50:12,902
<i>And if it seems almost too perfect,</i>

2231
01:50:12,904 --> 01:50:15,671
<i>trust me, this happened.</i>

2232
01:50:17,009 --> 01:50:23,546
Welcome, everyone. Please
give a generous welcome to

2233
01:50:23,548 --> 01:50:27,485
Mr. Bruce Miller and Mark Baum.

2234
01:50:44,304 --> 01:50:45,805
Strap yourself in.

2235
01:50:47,073 --> 01:50:49,305
So as some of you may know, Bear Stearns

2236
01:50:49,307 --> 01:50:51,976
has just received a loan from JP Morgan.

2237
01:50:51,978 --> 01:50:54,911
Of course, we're gonna have to
wait and see how the markets react,

2238
01:50:54,913 --> 01:50:58,683
but that should lay to rest any
concerns about the bank's health.

2239
01:50:58,685 --> 01:51:01,117
Now, I take it you have no plans to sell

2240
01:51:01,119 --> 01:51:03,754
your $200 million in Bear stock?

2241
01:51:03,756 --> 01:51:05,455
No. As a matter of fact,
when we're done here,

2242
01:51:05,457 --> 01:51:07,357
I'll probably go out and buy some more.

2243
01:51:08,761 --> 01:51:12,265
For the opposing view, Mr. Baum.

2244
01:51:14,667 --> 01:51:16,770
I got to stand for this.

2245
01:51:19,506 --> 01:51:21,505
Okay, hi.

2246
01:51:21,507 --> 01:51:24,273
My firm's thesis is pretty simple.

2247
01:51:24,275 --> 01:51:26,175
Wall Street took a good idea,

2248
01:51:26,177 --> 01:51:27,945
Lewis Ranieri's mortgage bond,

2249
01:51:27,947 --> 01:51:30,281
and turned it into an atomic bomb

2250
01:51:30,283 --> 01:51:32,784
of fraud and stupidity

2251
01:51:32,786 --> 01:51:35,519
that's on its way to
decimating the world economy.

2252
01:51:35,521 --> 01:51:38,187
How do you really feel?

2253
01:51:38,189 --> 01:51:40,190
I'm glad you still have a sense of humor.

2254
01:51:40,192 --> 01:51:42,626
I wouldn't if I were you.

2255
01:51:42,628 --> 01:51:46,729
Now, anyone who knows me knows that

2256
01:51:46,731 --> 01:51:49,299
I have no problem telling
someone they're wrong.

2257
01:51:49,301 --> 01:51:53,470
Bear Stearns is denying
rumors of liquidity problems.

2258
01:51:53,472 --> 01:51:55,742
Holy fuck, it's 39 now!

2259
01:51:57,909 --> 01:52:00,544
We live in an era of fraud in America.

2260
01:52:00,546 --> 01:52:03,380
Not just in banking, but in government,

2261
01:52:03,382 --> 01:52:06,416
education, religion, food,

2262
01:52:06,418 --> 01:52:08,585
even baseball.

2263
01:52:08,587 --> 01:52:11,821
What bothers me isn't that

2264
01:52:11,823 --> 01:52:15,925
fraud is not nice or that fraud is mean.

2265
01:52:15,927 --> 01:52:17,831
It's that for 15,000 years

2266
01:52:18,631 --> 01:52:20,263
fraud and short-sighted thinking

2267
01:52:20,265 --> 01:52:22,766
have never, ever worked.

2268
01:52:22,768 --> 01:52:25,768
- Jesus, Bear at 37...
- Not once.

2269
01:52:25,770 --> 01:52:29,106
Eventually, people get
caught, things go south.

2270
01:52:29,108 --> 01:52:30,674
It's fucking plummeting, man.

2271
01:52:30,676 --> 01:52:32,946
When the hell did we forget all that?

2272
01:52:37,115 --> 01:52:39,951
I thought we were better
than this. I really did.

2273
01:52:39,953 --> 01:52:42,119
And the fact that we're not

2274
01:52:42,121 --> 01:52:44,921
doesn't make me feel
all right and superior.

2275
01:52:44,923 --> 01:52:47,857
It makes me feel... Sad.

2276
01:52:47,859 --> 01:52:50,195
Every time I fucking hit
"refresh" it's dropping, man.

2277
01:52:51,863 --> 01:52:53,796
And as fun as it is to watch

2278
01:52:53,798 --> 01:52:56,199
pompous, dumb Wall
Streeters be wildly wrong,

2279
01:52:56,201 --> 01:52:59,303
and you are wrong, sir,

2280
01:52:59,305 --> 01:53:02,973
I just know, that at the end of the day

2281
01:53:02,975 --> 01:53:05,808
average people are going to be the ones

2282
01:53:05,810 --> 01:53:08,646
that are gonna have to pay for all this.

2283
01:53:08,648 --> 01:53:10,880
Because they always, always do.

2284
01:53:10,882 --> 01:53:11,982
It's 32.

2285
01:53:11,984 --> 01:53:13,483
It's fucking tanked, man.

2286
01:53:13,485 --> 01:53:15,488
That's my two cents. Thank you.

2287
01:53:16,823 --> 01:53:18,321
Let me drop a deuce at Deutsche.

2288
01:53:18,323 --> 01:53:21,325
Does our bull have a response?

2289
01:53:21,327 --> 01:53:24,960
Only that, in the entire
history of Wall Street,

2290
01:53:24,962 --> 01:53:27,330
no investment bank has ever failed

2291
01:53:27,332 --> 01:53:29,833
unless caught in criminal activities.

2292
01:53:29,835 --> 01:53:33,669
So, yes, I stand by my
Bear Stearns optimism.

2293
01:53:33,671 --> 01:53:36,174
Mr. Miller, I'm sorry. Quick question.

2294
01:53:36,176 --> 01:53:38,008
From the time you guys started talking,

2295
01:53:38,010 --> 01:53:40,977
Bear Stearns stock has
fallen more than 38%.

2296
01:53:40,979 --> 01:53:42,580
Would you still buy more?

2297
01:53:42,582 --> 01:53:46,686
Yeah, sure, of course
I'd buy more. Why not?

2298
01:53:47,153 --> 01:53:48,251
Boom.

2299
01:53:51,390 --> 01:53:52,724
Jesus Christ!

2300
01:53:54,193 --> 01:53:58,361
That concludes the first
part of our presentation.

2301
01:53:58,363 --> 01:54:03,099
Up next, we have the legendary
former chairman of the Fed,

2302
01:54:03,101 --> 01:54:04,968
Alan Greenspan.

2303
01:54:04,970 --> 01:54:06,306
Folks?

2304
01:54:24,422 --> 01:54:25,889
<i>...employees of
Lehman Brothers today,</i>

2305
01:54:25,891 --> 01:54:29,559
<i>as the Wall Street giant's
stock went to zero.</i>

2306
01:54:29,561 --> 01:54:31,562
<i>The collapse of the
venerable New York bank</i>

2307
01:54:31,564 --> 01:54:35,298
<i>follows a tumultuous few
months of market volatility</i>

2308
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:38,235
<i>and fear in the world economy.</i>

2309
01:54:38,237 --> 01:54:39,972
I got to see inside.

2310
01:54:40,738 --> 01:54:42,074
How?

2311
01:54:42,807 --> 01:54:44,607
Come on.

2312
01:54:44,609 --> 01:54:47,811
I left my phone in the office.
I threw my pass out already.

2313
01:54:47,813 --> 01:54:49,280
<i>Do you mind if I take your pass?</i>

2314
01:54:49,282 --> 01:54:51,885
I don't give a shit anymore.
You can do what you want.

2315
01:54:59,757 --> 01:55:01,558
Go directly to your transportation.

2316
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:03,427
Do not talk to the press.

2317
01:55:03,429 --> 01:55:06,996
After 18 years, I just leave?
That's just fucking great!

2318
01:55:06,998 --> 01:55:09,933
I'll talk to whoever the hell I want!

2319
01:55:09,935 --> 01:55:12,602
Do not talk to the press.

2320
01:55:12,604 --> 01:55:14,638
Go directly to your transportation.

2321
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:15,842
Do not talk to...

2322
01:55:18,344 --> 01:55:19,610
Hey, look, you wanna get a bite tonight?

2323
01:55:19,612 --> 01:55:22,112
There's this, uh, new Cuban place

2324
01:55:22,114 --> 01:55:24,447
just opened on the Lower East
Side. It's supposed to be good.

2325
01:55:24,449 --> 01:55:26,118
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

2326
01:55:26,618 --> 01:55:28,184
You and I?

2327
01:55:28,186 --> 01:55:29,853
Yeah, or other people.

2328
01:55:29,855 --> 01:55:31,687
- That sounds nice. I would like that.
- Yeah.

2329
01:55:31,689 --> 01:55:32,958
Finally.

2330
01:55:33,358 --> 01:55:34,959
Mark, hey.

2331
01:55:34,961 --> 01:55:36,360
<i>It's a bloodbath up here.</i>

2332
01:55:36,362 --> 01:55:37,928
<i>Morgan stock has
lost half its value.</i>

2333
01:55:37,930 --> 01:55:40,296
<i>It's down to 23.10.
It's in freefall.</i>

2334
01:55:40,298 --> 01:55:43,500
<i>Clients want to talk to you
about pulling their money.</i>

2335
01:55:43,502 --> 01:55:47,006
<i>It's now or never,
Mark. We got to sell.</i>

2336
01:55:50,309 --> 01:55:51,476
<i>Mark.</i>

2337
01:55:52,877 --> 01:55:54,378
<i>Mark, you hear me?</i>

2338
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:55,978
<i>Mailbox one.</i>

2339
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:59,049
<i>You have 15 messages.</i>

2340
01:56:00,319 --> 01:56:01,852
<i>Mike, I can't seem
to get ahold of you.</i>

2341
01:56:01,854 --> 01:56:04,324
<i>Will you please call me at
your earliest convenience.</i>

2342
01:56:05,657 --> 01:56:08,726
<i>It's Jack. You're buying stocks?</i>

2343
01:56:08,728 --> 01:56:11,928
<i>The market's at an all-time
low. This is crazy!</i>

2344
01:56:11,930 --> 01:56:14,665
<i>I met my wife on Match.com.</i>

2345
01:56:14,667 --> 01:56:16,199
<i>My profile said,</i>

2346
01:56:16,201 --> 01:56:18,635
<i>"I am a medical student
with only one eye,</i>

2347
01:56:18,637 --> 01:56:20,638
<i>"an awkward social manner,</i>

2348
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:24,210
<i>"and $145,000 in student loans."</i>

2349
01:56:24,877 --> 01:56:26,643
<i>She wrote back,</i>

2350
01:56:26,645 --> 01:56:28,214
<i>"You're just what I've
been looking for."</i>

2351
01:56:29,180 --> 01:56:31,046
<i>She meant honest.</i>

2352
01:56:31,048 --> 01:56:32,915
<i>So let me be honest.</i>

2353
01:56:32,917 --> 01:56:37,254
The housing crisis represents the
greatest financial opportunity of...

2354
01:56:37,256 --> 01:56:40,357
<i>Making money is not like
I thought it would be.</i>

2355
01:56:40,359 --> 01:56:45,028
<i>This business kills the part
of life that is essential.</i>

2356
01:56:45,030 --> 01:56:48,199
<i>The part that has nothing
to do with business.</i>

2357
01:56:50,368 --> 01:56:52,501
<i>For the past two
years, my insides...</i>

2358
01:56:53,706 --> 01:56:56,106
<i>...have felt like they're
eating themselves.</i>

2359
01:56:56,108 --> 01:56:58,875
<i>All the people I respected</i>

2360
01:56:58,877 --> 01:57:01,644
<i>won't talk to me anymore</i>

2361
01:57:01,646 --> 01:57:03,483
<i>except through lawyers.</i>

2362
01:57:07,219 --> 01:57:09,385
<i>People</i>

2363
01:57:09,387 --> 01:57:13,456
<i>want an authority to tell
them how to value things...</i>

2364
01:57:13,458 --> 01:57:18,995
<i>...but they choose this authority
not based on facts or results.</i>

2365
01:57:18,997 --> 01:57:23,733
<i>They choose it because it seems
authoritative and familiar.</i>

2366
01:57:23,735 --> 01:57:26,268
<i>And I am not</i>

2367
01:57:26,270 --> 01:57:29,341
<i>and never have been "familiar".</i>

2368
01:57:31,275 --> 01:57:33,175
<i>So...</i>

2369
01:57:33,177 --> 01:57:36,379
<i>So, I've come to the
sullen realization</i>

2370
01:57:36,381 --> 01:57:39,249
<i>that I must close down the fund.</i>

2371
01:57:39,251 --> 01:57:42,355
<i>Sincerely, Michael J. Burry, M.D.</i>

2372
01:58:42,079 --> 01:58:44,149
This isn't how I pictured it.

2373
01:58:46,152 --> 01:58:47,418
What did you think we'd find?

2374
01:58:47,420 --> 01:58:48,453
I don't know.

2375
01:58:50,322 --> 01:58:51,824
Grownups.

2376
01:58:55,761 --> 01:58:57,263
Mark, you there?

2377
01:58:59,931 --> 01:59:01,430
<i>Mark?</i>

2378
01:59:01,432 --> 01:59:04,337
Paulson and Bernanke
just left the White House.

2379
01:59:09,675 --> 01:59:11,844
There's going to be a bailout.

2380
01:59:13,444 --> 01:59:17,179
<i>Well, they had to. Right?</i>

2381
01:59:17,181 --> 01:59:18,447
<i>Paper markets would've collapsed.</i>

2382
01:59:18,449 --> 01:59:19,849
They knew.

2383
01:59:19,851 --> 01:59:21,451
<i>Cash would've stopped
coming out of ATMs.</i>

2384
01:59:21,453 --> 01:59:23,286
<i>They had to backstop this.</i>

2385
01:59:23,288 --> 01:59:25,688
They knew the taxpayers
would bail them out.

2386
01:59:25,690 --> 01:59:28,291
They weren't being stupid.
They just didn't care.

2387
01:59:28,293 --> 01:59:30,462
<i>Yeah. 'Cause they're fucking crooks.</i>

2388
01:59:32,364 --> 01:59:36,132
But at least we're going to
see some of them go to jail.

2389
01:59:36,134 --> 01:59:39,372
Right? I mean, they're gonna
have to break up the banks.

2390
01:59:40,471 --> 01:59:41,870
<i>I mean, the party's over.</i>

2391
01:59:41,872 --> 01:59:44,543
I don't know. I don't know, Vinnie.

2392
01:59:47,313 --> 01:59:48,879
I have a feeling

2393
01:59:48,881 --> 01:59:50,847
that in a few years
people are gonna be doing

2394
01:59:50,849 --> 01:59:54,317
what they always do when the economy tanks.

2395
01:59:54,319 --> 01:59:57,821
They will be blaming
immigrants and poor people.

2396
01:59:57,823 --> 02:00:00,290
<i>But Mark was wrong.</i>

2397
02:00:00,292 --> 02:00:02,326
<i>In the years that followed,
hundreds of bankers</i>

2398
02:00:02,328 --> 02:00:05,129
<i>and rating agencies
executives went to jail.</i>

2399
02:00:05,131 --> 02:00:07,330
<i>The SEC was completely overhauled.</i>

2400
02:00:07,332 --> 02:00:10,433
<i>And Congress had no choice
but to break up the big banks</i>

2401
02:00:10,435 --> 02:00:12,904
<i>and regulate the mortgage
and derivatives industries.</i>

2402
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:19,308
<i>Just kidding.</i>

2403
02:00:19,310 --> 02:00:21,577
<i>The banks took the money the
American people gave them</i>

2404
02:00:21,579 --> 02:00:23,946
<i>and used it to pay
themselves huge bonuses</i>

2405
02:00:23,948 --> 02:00:26,383
<i>and lobby Congress
to kill big reform.</i>

2406
02:00:26,385 --> 02:00:28,718
<i>And then they blamed
immigrants and poor people.</i>

2407
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:30,889
<i>And this time, even teachers.</i>

2408
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:33,557
<i>And when all was said and done,</i>

2409
02:00:33,559 --> 02:00:35,293
<i>only one single banker went to jail.</i>

2410
02:00:36,228 --> 02:00:37,427
<i>This poor schmuck.</i>

2411
02:00:37,429 --> 02:00:40,229
<i>Kareem Serageldin
from Credit Suisse.</i>

2412
02:00:40,231 --> 02:00:42,632
<i>He hid a few billion in
mortgage bond losses,</i>

2413
02:00:42,634 --> 02:00:45,904
<i>something most of the big banks did
on a good day during the crisis.</i>

2414
02:00:47,538 --> 02:00:49,541
Mark, can we sell now?

2415
02:00:51,344 --> 02:00:53,910
<i>The fund will make
almost $1 billion.</i>

2416
02:00:53,912 --> 02:00:55,547
<i>You'll clear $200 mil, Mark.</i>

2417
02:00:56,715 --> 02:00:59,715
You know, once we sell,

2418
02:00:59,717 --> 02:01:01,684
we'll be just like the rest of them.

2419
02:01:01,686 --> 02:01:03,120
You know that.

2420
02:01:03,122 --> 02:01:04,787
<i>No, we're not. We're
not the bad guys here.</i>

2421
02:01:04,789 --> 02:01:08,391
<i>We didn't defraud the American
people and prey on their dreams</i>

2422
02:01:08,393 --> 02:01:10,059
<i>of owning a home. All right?</i>

2423
02:01:10,061 --> 02:01:12,329
<i>They did.</i>

2424
02:01:12,331 --> 02:01:14,634
And now we get to kick them in the teeth.

2425
02:01:19,738 --> 02:01:21,740
A billion dollars.

2426
02:01:23,408 --> 02:01:24,741
<i>That's right.</i>

2427
02:01:24,743 --> 02:01:28,077
<i>But we got to close out our
position or it could be zero.</i>

2428
02:01:28,079 --> 02:01:30,916
<i>I mean, it's now or never, Mark.</i>

2429
02:01:40,091 --> 02:01:41,493
Okay.

2430
02:01:45,264 --> 02:01:46,666
Sell it all.

2431
02:03:47,522 --> 02:03:52,522
