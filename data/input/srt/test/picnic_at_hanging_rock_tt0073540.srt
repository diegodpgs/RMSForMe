1
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,991
<i>What we see...</i>

2
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,297
<i>and what we seem...</i>

3
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,935
<i>are but a dream...</i>

4
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,109
<i>a dream within a dream.</i>

5
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,890
"Meet me, love, when day is ending."

6
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,428
"I love thee for thy highborn grace,

7
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,402
thy deep and lustrous eyes,

8
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,372
for the sweet meaning of thy brow

9
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,638
and for thy bearing so high."

10
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,941
Six...

11
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,947
and seven...

12
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,917
and eight...

13
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,250
and nine...

14
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,483
and ten...

15
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,491
and 11.

16
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:51,563
"I love thee not because thou art fair,

17
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:56,125
softer than down, smoother than air,

18
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:59,069
nor for the cupids that do lie

19
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:02,471
in either corner of thine eye.

20
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,773
Wouldst thou then know what it might be?

21
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:09,747
'Tis I love thee 'cause thou lovest me."

22
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:12,711
<i>See the little horse</i>

23
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,408
<i>My little horse</i>

24
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,007
<i>Trotting down the paddock</i>

25
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,645
<i>On his fine white feet</i>

26
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:25,418
<i>Black horse, white horse</i>

27
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,654
<i>Brown horse, grey</i>

28
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,128
<i>Trotting down the paddock</i>

29
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,655
<i>On a bright, sunny day</i>

30
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:40,739
Someday, Sara, 
you shall have to come home with me to the station,

31
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,741
to Queensland,

32
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:47,508
and meet my sweet, funny family for yourself.

33
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,514
Would you like that?

34
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,250
You must learn to love someone else

35
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:03,659
apart from me, Sara.

36
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,262
I won't be here much longer.

37
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,808
What do you think, Miranda?

38
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,812
Somebody had the nerve to send Miss McCraw a card

39
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,043
on squared paper covered with tiny sums.

40
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,619
Girls! Girls!

41
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,749
Unless you all deport yourselves

42
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,589
with rather more grace
and considerably less noise,

43
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:39,119
Mrs. Appleyard will see to it 
that none of you go to Hanging Rock today.

44
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:40,597
Bonjour, Miss Lumley.

45
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,691
Good morning,
Mademoiselle de Poitiers.

46
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,474
I believe Mrs. Appleyard has decided
you're not to go on the picnic, Sara.

47
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,303
That makes two of us.

48
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,616
Off you go!

49
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,619
To St. Valentine!

50
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,704
<i>Frere Jacques
Frere Jacques</i>

51
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,713
<i>Dormez vous...</i>

52
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,117
Tais-toi, Irma.
Miss McCraw vient d'arriver.

53
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,852
She wants algebra today.

54
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,363
Today?

55
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,694
Good morning, girls.

56
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,855
Good morning, Mrs. Appleyard.

57
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,195
Well, young ladies, 
we are indeed fortunate in the weather

58
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,201
for our picnic to Hanging Rock.

59
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,329
I have instructed Mademoiselle 
that as the day is likely to be warm,

60
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:31,069
you may remove your gloves 
once the drag has passed through Woodend.

61
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:35,045
You will partake of luncheon
at the picnic grounds near the rock.

62
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:40,142
Once again let me remind you 
that the rock itself is extremely dangerous,

63
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:43,245
and you are therefore forbidden
any tomboy foolishness

64
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:46,780
in the matter of exploration,
even on the lower slopes.

65
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:51,193
I also wish to remind you, 
the vicinity is renowned for its venomous snakes

66
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,494
and poisonous ants of various species.

67
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,967
It is, however, a geological marvel

68
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:01,234
on which you will be required 
to write a brief essay on Monday morning.

69
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,242
That is all.
Have a pleasant day,

70
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,973
and try to behave yourselves 
in a manner to bring credit to the college.

71
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,880
Mr. Hussey! Mr. Hussey!

72
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:16,145
I shall expect you back,
Miss McCraw and Mademoiselle,

73
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,247
at about 8:00 for a light supper.

74
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,258
Come, girls.

75
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,895
Whoa!

76
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,585
This we do for pleasure,

77
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,457
so that we may shortly be at the mercy

78
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,929
of venomous snakes and poisonous ants.

79
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:03,200
How foolish can human creatures be?

80
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,116
There she is, ladies.
Hangin' Rock.

81
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,559
The mountain comes to Mohammed.

82
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:10,067
A hanging rock comes to Mr. Hussey.

83
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,362
More than 500 feet high she is.

84
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,103
Volcanic, of course.
Thousands of years old.

85
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:22,011
A million years old, Mr. Hussey, 
or thereabouts.

86
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:25,380
Yes, well, that'd be right.

87
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,976
Thousands, millions.

88
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:32,047
Devil of a long time, anyway,
in a manner of speakin'.

89
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:36,857
Only a million years ago.
Quite a recent eruption, really.

90
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,331
The rocks all around Mount Macedon itself

91
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:45,495
must be all of 350 million years old.

92
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,740
Siliceous lava forced up from deep down below.

93
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,611
Soda trachytes

94
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:02,313
extruded in a highly viscous state,

95
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:06,290
building the steep-sided mountains
we see in Hanging Rock.

96
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:12,687
And quite young, geologically speaking.
Barely a million years.

97
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:18,293
Waiting a million years just for us.

98
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:51,298
More cake, Michael?

99
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,464
No, thank you, Aunt. 
I'm...

100
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,804
I think I'll just, um, stretch my legs a bit.

101
00:12:56,876 --> 00:13:00,403
Oh, don't go too far and be careful.

102
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,970
There could be snakes.

103
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,284
How's it goin'?

104
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,616
All right.

105
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,986
They finished eating, have they?

106
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,960
Eh?

107
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:52,520
The colonel and the missus...
they finished eating, have they?

108
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,896
Oh, yes, they have.

109
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,401
Expect me up there in a minute, I suppose.

110
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,404
Clear away.

111
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:08,340
Can't be more'n midday.

112
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,847
No.

113
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:16,217
I thought it was a little early for lunch myself.

114
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,222
Yes.

115
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,959
Drink?

116
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,961
Thank you.

117
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:32,965
You know, they always allow an hour longer 
than it takes to get 'ere,

118
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,269
and then they got 'ere straight away.

119
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,674
Thanks.

120
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:48,178
Ah.

121
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,916
Not that they got anything else to do.

122
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,982
I mean, they never go for a walk or nothin'.

123
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,236
Get on!

124
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,743
Come on!

125
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,652
Take your hats.
Let's go walk about now.

126
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,653
To St. Valentine!

127
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,349
To St. Valentine!

128
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:22,009
I hope you have learned your poetry, Sara.

129
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,845
Sit up straight, child.
Hold your shoulders back.

130
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,010
You're getting a dreadful stoop.

131
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:30,613
Well, have you got your lines by heart?

132
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:33,249
Well, have you?

133
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,260
I can't.
It doesn't make sense.

134
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,263
Sense!
You little ignoramus!

135
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,266
Evidently you don't know that Mrs. Felicia Heymans

136
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,394
is considered one of the finest
of our English poets.

137
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:50,041
I know another piece of poetry by heart.

138
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:53,670
It has ever so many verses, 
much more than "The Wreck of the Hesperus."

139
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,043
Would that do?

140
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,048
What is the name of this poem?

141
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,050
"An Ode to St. Valentine."

142
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,882
I'm not acquainted with it.
Where did you find it?

143
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,388
I didn't find it.
I wrote it.

144
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,390
You wrote it?

145
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,521
"Love abounds, love surrounds..."

146
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,154
Oh, no thank you, Sara.

147
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:16,361
Strange as it may seem,
I still prefer Mrs. Heymans.

148
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:20,599
Give me your book and proceed to recite to me 
as far as you have gone.

149
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,765
Your book, please, Sara.

150
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:26,938
Thank you.

151
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,572
Go on.

152
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,014
I can't.

153
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,018
Not one line?

154
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,986
I shall leave you now, Sara.

155
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:43,256
I expect you to be word perfect 
when I send Miss Lumley in in half an hour.

156
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:46,161
Otherwise, I'm afraid
I shall have to send you to bed,

157
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,860
instead of letting you stay up
until the others return from the picnic.

158
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:07,116
Bertie! Bertie!

159
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,416
Jesus, where are you?

160
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,959
Oh, Miranda!

161
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,795
I like this one.

162
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:30,865
"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

163
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:35,642
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

164
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:39,650
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May.

165
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:43,950
And summer's lease hath all too short a date."

166
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,163
That's funny!

167
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,756
Blowed if me watch hasn't stopped.

168
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,933
Dead on 12:00.

169
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,476
Real funny.

170
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,738
C'est tres jolie, n'est-ce pas?

171
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:15,043
Uh, you wouldn't have the time, I suppose, miss?

172
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:22,154
Ah, Miranda, your pretty little diamond watch.

173
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,252
Don't wear it anymore.

174
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,490
Can't stand the ticking above my heart.

175
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:27,554
Ah.

176
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:33,199
If it were mine, I'd wear it always.

177
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,206
Even in the bath.

178
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:38,072
Would you, Mr. Hussey?

179
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:46,016
Stopped at 12:00.

180
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:50,544
Never stopped before.
Must be something magnetic.

181
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:53,853
Well after 2:00, I'd say.

182
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:57,726
We'd better be careful.
I promised Mrs. Appleyard

183
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:01,391
I'd have you lot back at the college by 8:00.

184
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,564
Except for those people down there,

185
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:11,302
we might be the only living creatures 
in the whole world.

186
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,526
Excuse me, Mademoiselle.

187
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,459
Yes, Marion?

188
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:33,521
I should like to make a few measurements 
of the base of the rock if we have time.

189
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,124
With Miranda and Irma.

190
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:43,437
Please, Mademoiselle.
We'll be back long before tea.

191
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,107
Et bien. Allez!

192
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,108
May I come too, please?

193
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,277
So long as you don't complain.

194
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,116
I won't.
I promise.

195
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,520
And don't worry about us, Mademoiselle.

196
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,457
We shall only be gone a little while.

197
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,077
Ah.

198
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,748
Now I know.

199
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,251
What do you know?

200
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,721
I know that Miranda is a Botticelli angel.

201
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,818
Wait!

202
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,694
Can you manage it, Edith?

203
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,528
I don't know.

204
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,370
I don't want to get my feet wet.

205
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,203
Oh!

206
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:37,380
Thought the little fat one was gonna take a bath.

207
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:44,122
Some of them are real lookers.

208
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,529
Have a look at the shape of the dark one 
with the curls.

209
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,568
Built like an hourglass.

210
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:56,802
And 'ave a go at the last one!
The blonde!

211
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,902
Oh, she'd have a decent pair of legs.

212
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,140
All the way up to her bum.

213
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:07,151
I'd rather you didn't say crude things like that.

214
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:11,713
Oh, I say the crude things.
You just think 'em.

215
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,088
Miranda!

216
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,093
Take my word for it.

217
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:19,255
The sheilas are all alike
when it comes to fellas.

218
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:22,425
Doesn't matter 
if it's a bloody college you come from,

219
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:26,437
or the Ballarat Orphanage 
where me and me kid sister was dragged up.

220
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:29,440
I didn't know you were an orphan.

221
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:34,104
Geez. I haven't thought of that bloody dump 
in donkeys' years.

222
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,354
Miranda!

223
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:04,338
I think I'll just, uh,
stretch my legs a bit before we go.

224
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:18,848
Look!

225
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:24,780
Not down at the ground, Edith.
Way up there in the sky.

226
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,815
Why can't we just sit on this log

227
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:01,818
and look at the ugly old rock from here?

228
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,023
It's nasty here!

229
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,559
I never thought it would be so nasty,

230
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,652
or I wouldn't have come!

231
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:12,688
We can't go much further.

232
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:14,816
We promised Mademoiselle...

233
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,061
we wouldn't be long away.

234
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:40,144
If only we could stay out all night

235
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,311
and watch the moon rise.

236
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:47,384
Blanche said Sara writes poetry in the dunny!

237
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:52,226
She found one there on the floor all about Miranda.

238
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,663
She's an orphan.

239
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:05,572
Sara reminds me of a little deer
Papa brought home once.

240
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:11,004
I looked after it, but it died.

241
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,943
Mama always said it was doomed.

242
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:21,451
Doomed?
What's that mean, Irma?

243
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:24,120
Doomed to die, of course.

244
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:26,595
"The boy stood on the burning deck,

245
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:29,189
whence all but he had fled, tra la..."

246
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,758
I forget the rest.

247
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:37,399
I think I must be doomed.
I don't feel at all well.

248
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:41,468
I do wish you'd stop talking for once.

249
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:46,006
Poor Edith.
We'll go back soon.

250
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:07,856
Irma! Look at them!

251
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:14,071
Where in the world are they going?

252
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,629
Without their shoes!

253
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:21,205
Irma, wait!
Wait for me!

254
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,544
Please wait!
Wait, Irma, wait!

255
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:35,351
Whatever can those people be doing down there?

256
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:39,089
Like a lot of ants.

257
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:44,100
Surprising the number of human beings 
are without purpose.

258
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:46,432
Although it is probable

259
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:51,100
they're performing some function
unknown to themselves.

260
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:08,058
Everything begins and ends

261
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:11,254
at exactly the right time

262
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,297
and place.

263
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:15,297
Look!

264
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,842
Miranda, I feel awful,

265
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,718
really awful.

266
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,918
Oh.

267
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:25,019
Miranda, I feel perfectly awful.

268
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,690
When are we going home?

269
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,667
When are we going home?

270
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:39,601
Miranda?

271
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,281
Miranda!

272
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,113
Miranda!

273
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:54,955
Miranda, don't go up there!
Come back!

274
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:32,091
I've gotta go.
That's Mrs. Appleyard.

275
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:33,755
Let someone else go.

276
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:36,299
They won't.
No. I'm on.

277
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,301
What time is it?

278
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:47,836
What've you got to do?

279
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:53,345
Mrs. Appleyard'll skin me.

280
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,647
We got plenty of time.

281
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,198
You'd better go.

282
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:39,729
Why are they so late?

283
00:37:09,659 --> 00:37:11,287
God be praised!

284
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,508
Mademoiselle, why are you so late?

285
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:29,945
Madame, something terrible has happened.

286
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:33,415
What? What do you mean?

287
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:35,281
I can't...

288
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:38,789
And where in heaven's name is Miss McCraw?

289
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,620
We left her behind at the rock.

290
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:43,626
You left her behind?

291
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:48,130
Has everyone taken leave of their senses?

292
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:51,532
Miss Lumley, get these girls to bed immediately.

293
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:55,038
And Cook, Cook!
Hot soup, please, for all of them.

294
00:37:57,208 --> 00:38:00,541
Mrs. Appleyard, I-I must speak to you alone.

295
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,078
Very well.

296
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:13,553
Straight up the stairs, girls.
Come along, quickly as you can.

297
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,990
Cook, I asked you for hot soup!

298
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:33,338
Well, ma'am, ma'am,
the strength of it is this.

299
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,579
Three of your young ladies

300
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,619
and Miss McCraw

301
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:47,887
are m-missing on the rock.

302
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:51,994
What happened?

303
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:57,333
Well, now, Mrs. Appleyard,

304
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:00,495
that's just the trouble.

305
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:03,369
Nobody knows what happened.

306
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:09,740
How soon after the girls did Miss McCraw leave?

307
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:13,341
Don't know.
No one knows.

308
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:17,382
No one saw her leave.
We were asleep.

309
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:22,718
And the little one?

310
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,886
Edith Horton.

311
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:29,693
Like I told you,

312
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:32,258
she come tearin' out of the bushes,

313
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:35,032
dress all torn,

314
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:38,405
screamin' fit to...

315
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:43,242
Well, after we'd shooshed her screamin',
all we could get out of her

316
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:47,250
was that she'd left the other three 
somewhere up on the rock.

317
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:54,586
That's about all I can tell ya.

318
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:03,360
Miranda! Miranda!

319
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:09,539
Marion!

320
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,475
Marion!

321
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,074
Go on, get out of here.

322
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,342
Ah, stop it!

323
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,017
Come on.

324
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:00,155
Miranda!

325
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,309
Try to remember, Edith.

326
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,411
What it was that frightened you on the rock.

327
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:33,385
Think carefully, darling.
Carefully!

328
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:37,693
Did you speak to anyone?

329
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:41,230
There must have been something.

330
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,391
Was there a man?

331
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:54,673
Her legs were quite severely scratched.

332
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:57,714
From running through the brambles,
I should imagine.

333
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,120
Nothing else?

334
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,858
Nothing I could detect.

335
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:21,226
She hadn't been... molested?

336
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:25,306
No, no, nothing like that.

337
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:29,972
I have examined her.
She is quite intact.

338
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:45,761
Since you won't tell me all the details,

339
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:48,923
how can I give you an opinion, Lionel?

340
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:51,126
There are no details.

341
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:53,795
People just don't disappear, my dear.

342
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:56,169
Not without good reason.

343
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:59,775
There's talk, is there?

344
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:03,779
Not just gossip.
People have... theories.

345
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:06,145
Go on.

346
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:09,117
Well, it couldn't be local.

347
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:11,279
Why couldn't it?

348
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:15,416
No one around here would do a thing like that.

349
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:19,121
I've just told you, Sergeant,
I simply noticed three young ladies crossing the creek.

350
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:21,562
What did they look like?

351
00:43:22,632 --> 00:43:23,862
Hmm?

352
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,300
The girls.
Describe them to me.

353
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:31,307
Hmm, um, the first one was tall and dark.

354
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,713
Um, then there was the little dumpy one,

355
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,682
then the girl with the glasses,

356
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:44,619
and the last one was slim and fair.

357
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,681
That's four.

358
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:52,528
Pardon?

359
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:55,656
A few minutes ago 
you said there was only three of them.

360
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:58,201
Oh-Oh, ye...

361
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:01,999
That's because the dumpy one
was back a little.

362
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:05,803
And then they moved off into the trees

363
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:08,970
and that's the last we saw of them.

364
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:15,377
Perhaps we could go a little higher.

365
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:19,055
I was tired.

366
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:22,688
I sat down on a log.

367
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,194
Which log, Edith?
This one?

368
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:28,925
Look around you, darling.
Maybe you can see it now.

369
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,433
Is that the one?
You went that way?

370
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,436
I don't know.

371
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:37,372
I was tired.
I'm tired now.

372
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,810
There is one thing I remember.

373
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:48,283
What do you remember, Edith? 
Tell us.

374
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,479
It was when I was coming down,

375
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:52,954
when I was running.

376
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,082
It was a cloud.

377
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:57,457
What sort of a cloud?

378
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,429
It was red.

379
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:04,399
I remember it clearly.
It was just after I passed Miss McCraw.

380
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,638
Who did you say you saw?

381
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,571
Miss McCraw.

382
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:13,974
She was going up the hill as I was going down.

383
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:17,309
Did she stop?
Did you speak?

384
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:20,043
No. She was too far away.

385
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:24,315
She was about as far away
as those dead trees are over there.

386
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,887
She was funny.

387
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:33,452
Funny?

388
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:35,657
How?

389
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,826
I'd rather not say.

390
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:42,167
You must, Edith.
It could be very important.

391
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,173
It's rude.

392
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,350
Les pantalons.

393
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:02,483
She had no skirt.
Just les pantalons.

394
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:07,997
Drawers? 
You mean she was just wearing drawers?

395
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:49,972
One last go...

396
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:53,476
for the bloodhound.

397
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:01,650
Miranda.

398
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:08,208
Why didn't you tell us
you followed the four girls?

399
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,754
Because...

400
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:16,350
I didn't exactly follow them.

401
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:19,259
I just jumped across the creek

402
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,991
and walked towards the rock for a little way.

403
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,001
I was curious.

404
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:34,606
In England, young ladies like that
wouldn't be allowed to go walking in the forest.

405
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:37,613
Not alone, anyway.

406
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:42,050
But they'd gone by the time I came out of the trees, 
so I turned back.

407
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:52,018
As the girls were jumping the creek...

408
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:56,332
what were you thinking of?

409
00:49:05,073 --> 00:49:06,866
Hmm?

410
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:30,432
Ah, Michael.

411
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:12,875
Oh, Michael!

412
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:39,958
The old man hired me to look after the horses.

413
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,767
I'm buggered if I'm gonna be a lackey 
at a bloody garden party.

414
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:48,043
That's what I bloody well told 'im.

415
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,045
More or less.

416
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:05,294
Had the bloodhound out the other day.

417
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,662
I wake up every night in a cold sweat.

418
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:19,632
Just wondering if they're still alive.

419
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:22,644
Yeah, well, the way I look at it is this:

420
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:25,909
If the bloody cop and the bloody abo tracker

421
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:29,918
and the bloody dog can't find 'em,
well, no one bloody can.

422
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:33,452
People have been bushed before today,

423
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:36,083
and as far as I'm concerned,
that's the stone end of it.

424
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:38,719
Well, it's not the end of it
as far as I'm concerned.

425
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:44,023
They may be out there dying of thirst on...

426
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:48,904
on that infernal rock and...

427
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:51,907
you and I are sitting here 
drinking cold bloody beer.

428
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:59,237
That's where you and me's different.

429
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:08,046
If you want my advice, 
the sooner you forget the whole thing, the better.

430
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,424
Well, I can't forget it, and I never will.

431
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,070
I'm not great shakes on music,

432
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,166
but I reckon the governor must be leavin', eh?

433
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:30,512
Your aunt'll give you hell
if you're not on show.

434
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,946
Albert.

435
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:35,450
I want to go back to the rock.

436
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:41,223
To look for them.

437
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:45,519
Will you come with me?

438
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:02,542
Beautiful birds, them swans.

439
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:08,146
A week in the bush...

440
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:11,215
they'd be dead by now.

441
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:16,425
Then I'll go alone.

442
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:40,099
Coo-ee!

443
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:29,524
Albert!

444
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:32,527
Hello?

445
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:44,536
Coo-ee!

446
00:55:49,443 --> 00:55:52,378
Mike!

447
00:55:53,614 --> 00:55:56,583
Michael!

448
00:56:09,797 --> 00:56:12,664
Michael!

449
00:56:25,813 --> 00:56:28,407
We'll have to be goin' soon.

450
00:56:28,482 --> 00:56:31,246
Dark before we get back.

451
00:56:31,318 --> 00:56:33,513
I'm staying here.

452
00:56:33,587 --> 00:56:35,521
You're what?

453
00:56:37,024 --> 00:56:38,958
I'm staying here.

454
00:56:39,026 --> 00:56:40,960
Here? On the rock?

455
00:56:41,028 --> 00:56:42,655
Yes.

456
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:47,099
What the hell for?
You're mad.

457
00:56:47,168 --> 00:56:50,228
Yes, perhaps I am. 
But I'm still staying, because somebody has to.

458
00:56:50,304 --> 00:56:52,238
Just because you lot are Australians...

459
00:56:52,306 --> 00:56:53,534
You're a funny bugger.

460
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:59,777
Well, what the hell am I gonna tell 'em
when I get back there without ya?

461
00:56:59,847 --> 00:57:02,042
You can tell 'em what you like.

462
00:57:04,819 --> 00:57:08,220
Hmm? What? Woodend?

463
00:57:08,289 --> 00:57:10,223
The Victoria, sir.

464
00:57:10,291 --> 00:57:13,624
The little pub near the corner.

465
00:57:13,694 --> 00:57:18,063
Mr. Michael's pretty knocked up, sir.
He's sleepin' there.

466
00:57:20,167 --> 00:57:22,362
The pub.

467
00:57:22,436 --> 00:57:25,337
Yeah. Yeah.

468
00:57:25,406 --> 00:57:28,068
I'm dashed if I know how his aunt will take it.

469
00:57:31,045 --> 00:57:32,478
Yeah.

470
00:57:40,955 --> 00:57:42,889
All right.
Carry on, Crundall.

471
00:57:42,957 --> 00:57:44,891
Thank you, sir.

472
01:00:05,799 --> 01:00:07,960
<i>Stopped at twelve.</i>

473
01:00:08,035 --> 01:00:09,969

478
01:00:26,186 --> 01:00:28,120

479
01:00:28,188 --> 01:00:30,452
<i>What do you know?</i>

480
01:00:30,524 --> 01:00:33,084

Coo-ee!

495
01:03:40,447 --> 01:03:42,438
Let me have him now, son.

496
01:03:42,516 --> 01:03:45,952
I've had 30 years experience puttin' them in,

497
01:03:46,019 --> 01:03:49,182
so they don't fall out back on the road.

498
01:03:56,163 --> 01:03:58,563
Eh, take her quietly, Sergeant.

499
01:05:43,737 --> 01:05:47,935
Oh, Jesus. Jesus.

500
01:06:00,187 --> 01:06:02,382
Help me!

501
01:06:14,067 --> 01:06:16,001
Help me!

502
01:06:20,273 --> 01:06:22,207
Mademoiselle, they found Irma.

503
01:06:22,275 --> 01:06:23,401
What did you say?

504
01:06:23,477 --> 01:06:25,741
They found Irma, and she's still alive.

505
01:06:27,514 --> 01:06:29,448
Oh...

506
01:06:32,953 --> 01:06:35,183
No one else?

507
01:06:35,255 --> 01:06:36,688
No.

508
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:56,600
Now go home.
There's nothing you can do.

509
01:07:00,213 --> 01:07:03,614
Go on, now. Go home!
This is a police matter.

510
01:07:09,122 --> 01:07:11,056
Well, go on.

511
01:07:26,807 --> 01:07:28,968
We've got a bloody right to know.

512
01:07:29,042 --> 01:07:31,272
We'd like to know what's going on.

513
01:07:31,344 --> 01:07:34,370
He's right.

514
01:07:34,448 --> 01:07:38,714
We simply want something done about it.

515
01:07:38,785 --> 01:07:40,719
Where's Bumpher?

516
01:07:43,523 --> 01:07:46,617
What we should do 
is go to the bloody rock ourselves.

517
01:07:48,528 --> 01:07:50,792
We've got our own self-respect to think about.

518
01:07:50,864 --> 01:07:54,630
He's right, there.
Get Bumpher out here. Come on.

519
01:07:54,701 --> 01:07:56,635
Come out, Bumpher!

520
01:07:59,706 --> 01:08:01,503
Go back.

521
01:08:01,575 --> 01:08:05,511
Go on. Go home.
The bloody lot of you.

522
01:08:05,579 --> 01:08:07,604
Nothing you can do.

523
01:08:18,592 --> 01:08:20,526
We can thank the Lord

524
01:08:20,594 --> 01:08:23,859
for this merciful deliverance
of our dear classmate Irma,

525
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:26,262
and pray that Marion and Miranda

526
01:08:26,333 --> 01:08:29,734
and our beloved Miss McCraw will be likewise spared.

527
01:08:29,803 --> 01:08:32,795
It has been seen fit that Irma should convalesce

528
01:08:32,873 --> 01:08:36,138
at the home of Colonel Fitzhubert
in Mount Macedon.

529
01:08:36,209 --> 01:08:39,337
Although you'll be delighted at these good tidings,

530
01:08:39,412 --> 01:08:41,812
I would ask you to remember, please,

531
01:08:41,882 --> 01:08:43,816
that of the three remaining lost members 
of the party,

532
01:08:43,884 --> 01:08:46,978
there is, as yet, no trace.

533
01:08:47,053 --> 01:08:49,851
Would you come with me to my study, 
please, Miss Lumley?

534
01:08:49,923 --> 01:08:52,357
You may carry on, Mademoiselle.

535
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:16,271
Wonderful news, Mrs. Appleyard.

536
01:09:17,684 --> 01:09:20,118
Don't be so foolish, woman!

537
01:09:20,186 --> 01:09:22,882
If all of them had been found but only one?

538
01:09:22,956 --> 01:09:26,153
This makes it worse.
Far worse.

539
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:29,794
This tragedy is little more than a week old

540
01:09:29,863 --> 01:09:32,195
and already three... three, mark you... 
sets of parents

541
01:09:32,265 --> 01:09:37,134
have written advising me 
that their daughters will not be here next term.

542
01:09:37,203 --> 01:09:40,969
Now the newspapers have something further 
to sensationalize about.

543
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:44,135
Newspapers all over the world have headlined 
our morbid affair, Miss Lumley.

544
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:46,644
I mean, you realize that, I suppose.

545
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:50,138
The three who have been withdrawn,

546
01:09:50,216 --> 01:09:52,150
plus the three still missing on the rock...

547
01:09:52,218 --> 01:09:55,449
Two, Mrs. Appleyard. Only two now.
I'm quite sure Irma will be coming back.

548
01:09:55,522 --> 01:09:59,151
That makes six, Miss Lumley...

549
01:09:59,225 --> 01:10:01,819
will not be with us next term.

550
01:10:03,797 --> 01:10:08,461
In addition, there are several sets of tuition fees 
impossibly overdue.

551
01:10:08,535 --> 01:10:10,969
Sara Waybourne, for instance.

552
01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:16,504
Most inconsiderate,
if I may say so, Mrs. Appleyard.

553
01:10:17,811 --> 01:10:19,745
Yes.

554
01:10:21,147 --> 01:10:23,138
Well, I...

555
01:10:23,216 --> 01:10:27,516
I expect we shall see our way through somehow.

556
01:10:27,587 --> 01:10:30,522
But don't let me detain you, Miss Lumley.
You have a class in a few minutes, I believe.

557
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:32,649
Senior needlework.

558
01:10:32,726 --> 01:10:36,526
Just ask the Waybourne girl
to come in to see me, please.

559
01:10:36,596 --> 01:10:39,531
After luncheon will be convenient.

560
01:10:39,599 --> 01:10:40,861
Yes, Mrs. Appleyard.

561
01:10:42,702 --> 01:10:45,500
Oh, and Miss Lumley...

562
01:10:45,572 --> 01:10:49,668
do your best to forbid any idle gossip
about this whole wretched business.

563
01:10:49,743 --> 01:10:52,177
Yes, Mrs. Appleyard.
I will.

564
01:11:44,531 --> 01:11:45,964
Shh!

565
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:51,703
Ah!

566
01:11:59,546 --> 01:12:04,245
Remarkable. Hmm.

567
01:12:04,317 --> 01:12:08,515
A week out in the bush and nothing more serious

568
01:12:08,588 --> 01:12:12,217
than shock and exposure.

569
01:12:12,292 --> 01:12:15,193
Extraordinary.

570
01:12:15,261 --> 01:12:17,991
No bones broken.

571
01:12:18,064 --> 01:12:22,763
Some cuts and bruises to the face and hands.

572
01:12:24,437 --> 01:12:26,871
To the hands especially.

573
01:12:31,511 --> 01:12:33,445
Quite scratched.

574
01:12:35,181 --> 01:12:39,515
The fingernails are all torn and broken.

575
01:12:39,586 --> 01:12:43,750
There are several other unusual features.

576
01:12:43,823 --> 01:12:46,553
Her head is quite badly bruised.

577
01:12:47,627 --> 01:12:51,358
Probable concussion.

578
01:12:51,431 --> 01:12:54,195
A blow, maybe?

579
01:12:54,267 --> 01:12:57,259
Or a fall?

580
01:12:57,337 --> 01:13:00,602
But then if she fell,

581
01:13:00,673 --> 01:13:04,131
why is the rest of the body unmarked?

582
01:13:05,211 --> 01:13:07,145
It's quite unblemished.

583
01:13:08,782 --> 01:13:14,118
And the feet, too, are quite unmarked,
which is very strange

584
01:13:14,187 --> 01:13:18,385
as she was not wearing shoes or stockings 
when she was found.

585
01:13:18,458 --> 01:13:20,756
We found no trace of 'em up on the rocks.

586
01:13:20,827 --> 01:13:22,761
Mmm.

587
01:13:24,798 --> 01:13:26,732
She's quite intact.

588
01:13:29,736 --> 01:13:34,002
I'd give my head to know
what really happened up there.

589
01:13:37,577 --> 01:13:39,511
She's quite intact.

590
01:13:44,350 --> 01:13:46,648
What is it, my girl?

591
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:49,244
Well, ma'am, it's Miss Irma.

592
01:13:49,322 --> 01:13:50,949
Yes?

593
01:13:51,024 --> 01:13:54,289
Well, it's about her clothing.

594
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,294
What is it, my dear?

595
01:13:56,362 --> 01:14:00,594
Well, I didn't know whether the sergeant 
should be told.

596
01:14:00,667 --> 01:14:04,228
There's, there's no corset.

597
01:14:04,304 --> 01:14:08,035
Miss Irma's corset.
It's missing.

598
01:14:08,107 --> 01:14:10,166
You did right, my dear.

599
01:14:10,243 --> 01:14:13,110
It can't possibly be of any interest.

600
01:14:15,181 --> 01:14:19,845
<i>The north wind brings me no rest</i>

601
01:14:21,588 --> 01:14:23,954
Any number of unsolved murders there are.

602
01:14:26,993 --> 01:14:29,655
Take, take Jack the Ripper, for instance.

603
01:14:39,205 --> 01:14:41,730
The police are up there again, naturally.

604
01:14:41,808 --> 01:14:43,742
Thick as flies.

605
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:49,048
Someone reported seein' a light flashing 
around a pigsty

606
01:14:49,115 --> 01:14:52,278
on a place about a mile from the rock.

607
01:14:52,352 --> 01:14:56,254
There's some questions got answers 
and some haven't.

608
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:05,559
No. There'll be a solution turn up directly, 
more'n likely.

609
01:15:09,202 --> 01:15:11,136
A kidnappin'.

610
01:15:12,505 --> 01:15:17,499
Or, you know, something like that.

611
01:15:19,145 --> 01:15:21,579
They might have fallen down a hole.

612
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:30,619
No, no. There's a solution somewhere, all right.

613
01:15:31,925 --> 01:15:34,086
There's gotta be.

614
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:36,492
Come over here.
Come on.

615
01:15:36,562 --> 01:15:38,496
Over here.

616
01:15:42,669 --> 01:15:46,435
Did you know, lad, 
there are some plants that can move?

617
01:15:48,541 --> 01:15:50,475
No.

618
01:16:14,901 --> 01:16:18,064
Miss Lumley said you wanted to see me, 
Mrs. Appleyard.

619
01:16:18,137 --> 01:16:21,300
That is correct.
Come in.

620
01:16:22,775 --> 01:16:24,709
Close the door, please.

621
01:16:37,523 --> 01:16:42,119
I have written several letters to your guardian, 
Mr. Cosgrove, Sara,

622
01:16:42,195 --> 01:16:45,426
but I have not been favored with a reply thus far.

623
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:52,297
In fact, it is all of six months
since I have received a letter

624
01:16:52,372 --> 01:16:55,466
or a check.

625
01:16:55,541 --> 01:17:00,478
I, therefore, have no alternative
but to cancel all your extras.

626
01:17:00,546 --> 01:17:02,639
This means that, as of today,

627
01:17:02,715 --> 01:17:07,379
you can no longer partake
in dancing or drawing lessons.

628
01:17:07,453 --> 01:17:11,685
And unless all your outstanding fees 
are paid by Easter,

629
01:17:11,758 --> 01:17:16,388
I'm afraid we shall have to make other arrangements.

630
01:17:17,563 --> 01:17:20,760
You know what that means, don't you, Sara?

631
01:17:23,503 --> 01:17:25,437
You will have to go away.

632
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:32,177
There are places for girls in your predicament. 
Institutions.

633
01:17:39,652 --> 01:17:41,586
Now off you go.

634
01:17:43,356 --> 01:17:45,290
Sara.

635
01:18:09,015 --> 01:18:12,143
Sara!
What's wrong with you?

636
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,254
Are you feeling ill?

637
01:18:19,058 --> 01:18:22,721
People don't sit on cold steps in the dark 
unless they're weak in the head.

638
01:18:26,966 --> 01:18:30,424
You heard the bell.
Go and wash for supper.

639
01:18:36,075 --> 01:18:38,009
Aren't you hungry?

640
01:18:41,314 --> 01:18:44,044
Well, you best go straight to bed.

641
01:18:51,491 --> 01:18:52,924
Quickly.

642
01:19:00,133 --> 01:19:03,500
Tell Mademoiselle I don't want it. 
Thank you.

643
01:19:03,569 --> 01:19:08,199
But you must eat.
You'll get sick if you don't.

644
01:19:08,274 --> 01:19:12,836
I'm sick already.
If I eat that, I'll be even sicker.

645
01:19:12,912 --> 01:19:14,903
Nonsense.
Now come on, Miss Sara.

646
01:19:14,981 --> 01:19:17,575
Do you know what, Minnie?

647
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:20,118
No. What?

648
01:19:20,186 --> 01:19:23,155
I was in an orphanage once.

649
01:19:23,222 --> 01:19:25,156
Were you, Sara?

650
01:19:29,962 --> 01:19:34,763
I had a brother then... called Bertie.

651
01:19:43,676 --> 01:19:48,340
I told the matron 
I wanted to be a lady circus rider

652
01:19:48,414 --> 01:19:51,850
on a white horse with a spangled dress.

653
01:19:54,854 --> 01:19:59,689
She was afraid I'd run away,
so she shaved my head.

654
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:05,162
I bit her arm. It bled.

655
01:20:06,999 --> 01:20:10,560
So she painted my head with gentian violet.

656
01:20:27,253 --> 01:20:32,520
<i>The north wind brings me no rest</i>

657
01:20:32,592 --> 01:20:37,529
<i>And death is in the sky</i>

658
01:20:39,865 --> 01:20:43,596
<i>I love you, Minnie</i>

659
01:20:46,138 --> 01:20:48,072
I love you, darlin'.

660
01:20:50,443 --> 01:20:53,606
I feel sorry for them kids.

661
01:20:57,049 --> 01:21:00,018
The ones on the rock, you mean?

662
01:21:00,086 --> 01:21:02,020
Yeah, them too.

663
01:21:03,956 --> 01:21:09,553
I was thinkin' of them other poor little devils, 
here at the college.

664
01:21:11,831 --> 01:21:16,200
Them. They're all right.

665
01:21:16,269 --> 01:21:19,238
Rollin' in cash, most of them.

666
01:21:19,305 --> 01:21:21,239
Or at least their mothers and fathers are.

667
01:21:21,307 --> 01:21:24,435
Some of them are orphans...

668
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:26,637
or wards, or...

669
01:21:28,314 --> 01:21:30,248
You know.

670
01:21:59,845 --> 01:22:02,780
<i>Now I know.</i>

671
01:22:02,848 --> 01:22:06,944
<i>What do you know?
What do you know?</i>

672
01:22:09,021 --> 01:22:13,481
<i>I know that Miranda is a Botticelli angel.</i>

673
01:22:45,191 --> 01:22:47,284
Hold it right there.
Thanks, gentlemen.

674
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,294
That's it. Smile, please.

675
01:22:49,362 --> 01:22:52,160
Come on. Big smile.

676
01:22:52,231 --> 01:22:54,529
Thank you, thank you.

677
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:03,074
Get those women over here, please.

678
01:23:08,013 --> 01:23:11,471
The rope.
Not that stuff. The other.

679
01:23:11,550 --> 01:23:13,609
Give me that rope over here.

680
01:23:13,686 --> 01:23:16,382
What about a cup of tea up here?

681
01:23:16,455 --> 01:23:18,616
Ah, tea. Ah.

682
01:23:21,293 --> 01:23:23,227
Hello!

683
01:23:32,838 --> 01:23:35,602
Good, good.

684
01:23:35,674 --> 01:23:37,608
As if looking up.
Right up.

685
01:23:37,676 --> 01:23:40,076
That's it. 
Looking for a cave or something like that.

686
01:23:40,146 --> 01:23:42,580
Little more expression in the face, sir.

687
01:23:51,357 --> 01:23:53,291
Hello, Irma.

688
01:23:56,996 --> 01:23:59,430
Madame Fitzhubert showed me in.

689
01:24:04,069 --> 01:24:06,003
How do you feel?

690
01:24:11,010 --> 01:24:13,171
Oh, Irma!

691
01:24:13,245 --> 01:24:15,179
Oh, Irma.

692
01:24:16,549 --> 01:24:18,983
We thought you had gone forever.

693
01:24:25,758 --> 01:24:28,192
Let me look at you, cherie.

694
01:24:30,563 --> 01:24:33,726
You are so pale...

695
01:24:33,799 --> 01:24:36,233
but prettier than ever.

696
01:24:40,573 --> 01:24:43,701
Has the nephew paid you a visit yet,

697
01:24:43,776 --> 01:24:46,404
the one who found you?

698
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:48,413
Yes.

699
01:24:50,516 --> 01:24:52,450
And the policeman.

700
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:56,754
And you couldn't...

701
01:24:59,692 --> 01:25:03,628
I, I remember... nothing.

702
01:25:03,696 --> 01:25:06,893
Nothing!
I remember nothing!

703
01:27:48,293 --> 01:27:50,227
Morning.

704
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:53,364
Send that reporter packing!

705
01:27:53,432 --> 01:27:55,400
Girls. Girls, get inside at once!

706
01:27:57,970 --> 01:28:00,803
There you are, Miranda, dear.

707
01:28:00,873 --> 01:28:03,933
You liked these best.

708
01:28:04,009 --> 01:28:07,740
Mr. Whitehead gave them to me to give to you,

709
01:28:07,813 --> 01:28:11,806
my dear, my sweet Miranda.

710
01:28:22,094 --> 01:28:24,585
She likes daisies best of all.

711
01:28:25,831 --> 01:28:29,062
Oh, Sara! Oh, Sara!

712
01:28:31,136 --> 01:28:34,697
You do know that Miranda might not come back.

713
01:28:42,247 --> 01:28:45,739
Miranda knows lots of things
other people don't know.

714
01:28:48,921 --> 01:28:50,855
Secrets.

715
01:28:57,362 --> 01:28:59,796
She knew she wouldn't come back.

716
01:29:09,775 --> 01:29:14,337
Fanny, you are ridiculously out of step.
Pay attention to the music, please!

717
01:29:36,902 --> 01:29:40,201
Excuse me, Miss Lumley.
Voila, mes enfants!

718
01:29:40,272 --> 01:29:42,763
See who we have with us today?

719
01:29:42,841 --> 01:29:47,437
Our dear Irma is with us but for a few hours.

720
01:29:47,513 --> 01:29:51,381
She is leaving soon
to join her parents in Europe.

721
01:29:53,685 --> 01:29:56,085
Alors, mes enfants.

722
01:29:56,155 --> 01:29:58,953
For ten minutes, you may talk as you choose.

723
01:29:59,024 --> 01:30:01,720
If you approve, Miss Lumley.

724
01:30:28,987 --> 01:30:32,957
Tell us, Irma! Tell us!

725
01:30:33,025 --> 01:30:34,959
What happened to Miranda, Irma?

726
01:30:35,027 --> 01:30:36,961
You know what happened.
Tell us!

727
01:30:40,465 --> 01:30:42,433
Tell us, Irma!

728
01:30:42,501 --> 01:30:45,436
Why don't you tell us, Irma?
You know where they are!

729
01:30:45,504 --> 01:30:49,338
Just tell us, Irma!
Tell us!

730
01:30:49,408 --> 01:30:51,968
They're dead!
All dead and gone, Irma!

731
01:30:54,947 --> 01:30:58,246
She's going to you know where!

732
01:30:58,317 --> 01:31:00,285
You are a liar and a fool!

733
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:31,649
Mademoiselle?

734
01:31:31,717 --> 01:31:35,744
It's for her own good!
To cure her terrible stooping!

735
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:56,774
Come in.

736
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:07,744
Well? Come in.

737
01:32:20,232 --> 01:32:22,666
My notice, ma'am.

738
01:33:11,049 --> 01:33:13,847
Have we an invalid in the house?

739
01:33:13,919 --> 01:33:16,285
Miss Sara's supper, ma'am.

740
01:33:16,355 --> 01:33:19,688
Mademoiselle asked me, 
seeing as the child's feeling poorly.

741
01:33:19,758 --> 01:33:21,919
Oh. Minnie!

742
01:33:21,994 --> 01:33:23,985
Hmm?

743
01:33:24,062 --> 01:33:28,624
Kindly tell Miss Sara not to put her light out
until I've had a word with her.

744
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:30,634
Yes, ma'am.

745
01:33:40,145 --> 01:33:43,080
This is not a charitable institution.

746
01:33:57,662 --> 01:34:00,859
You recall our recent discussion, Sara.

747
01:34:03,869 --> 01:34:07,066
Answer me when I address you, child.

748
01:34:07,139 --> 01:34:09,266
Yes.

749
01:34:09,341 --> 01:34:12,833
I have considered your situation most carefully,

750
01:34:14,346 --> 01:34:18,715
and I have searched my mind
and my conscience for a solution.

751
01:34:18,784 --> 01:34:23,278
But this is not a charitable institution.

752
01:34:23,355 --> 01:34:25,983
And as your fees have not been forthcoming,

753
01:34:26,058 --> 01:34:30,620
I have been forced to make certain arrangements 
on your behalf.

754
01:34:33,932 --> 01:34:35,991
You will be returned to the orphanage.

755
01:36:13,231 --> 01:36:15,165
You still thinking about that bloody rock?

756
01:36:15,233 --> 01:36:17,758
I can't help it.

757
01:36:17,836 --> 01:36:20,737
It comes back at night in dreams.

758
01:36:21,706 --> 01:36:24,675
I had a funny dream last night.

759
01:36:24,743 --> 01:36:27,940
There was this smell.
Real strong.

760
01:36:29,381 --> 01:36:33,283
It was like, like I was wide awake.
Dead quiet.

761
01:36:34,886 --> 01:36:37,150
Pansies.
That's what it smelt like.

762
01:36:37,222 --> 01:36:40,316
And the whole place was all lit up, 
bright as day.

763
01:36:43,261 --> 01:36:45,195
Pitch black outside.

764
01:36:46,765 --> 01:36:48,699
And there she is.

765
01:36:50,168 --> 01:36:52,102
Who was it?

766
01:36:52,170 --> 01:36:54,104
It was only a bloody dream!

767
01:36:57,175 --> 01:37:01,305
My kid sister. 
Haven't seen her since the orphanage.

768
01:37:01,379 --> 01:37:03,813
She always liked pansies.

769
01:37:05,951 --> 01:37:10,820
And she went all sort of... misty-like.

770
01:37:13,325 --> 01:37:18,160
I calls out, "Sara, don't go yet."

771
01:37:20,498 --> 01:37:23,194
"Good-bye, Bertie," she says.

772
01:37:23,268 --> 01:37:27,261
"I've come a long way to see ya,
and now I must go."

773
01:37:28,273 --> 01:37:30,207
And she went.

774
01:37:31,376 --> 01:37:33,310
Clear through that wall over there.

775
01:37:43,188 --> 01:37:44,951
Sit down, please, Mademoiselle.

776
01:37:45,023 --> 01:37:46,957
Merci.

777
01:37:47,025 --> 01:37:50,927
We were speaking last night
about the Waybourne girl.

778
01:37:50,996 --> 01:37:54,762
You expressed concern over the state of her health.

779
01:37:54,833 --> 01:37:56,198
Yes, madame.

780
01:37:56,268 --> 01:37:59,760
We have been relieved of any further responsibility.

781
01:37:59,838 --> 01:38:05,174
Her guardian, Mr. Cosgrove, 
arrived this morning and took her away with him.

782
01:38:09,514 --> 01:38:13,211
That's... 
But was she fit enough to travel?

783
01:38:14,286 --> 01:38:16,618
Apparently.

784
01:38:16,688 --> 01:38:19,680
I should have been here to supervise her packing.

785
01:38:19,758 --> 01:38:22,591
I, myself, helped Sara put a few things 
she especially wanted

786
01:38:22,661 --> 01:38:24,595
into her little covered basket.

787
01:38:24,663 --> 01:38:26,995
Mr. Cosgrove was in a hurry to get away.

788
01:38:27,065 --> 01:38:29,693
I shall not be coming into luncheon, Mademoiselle.

789
01:38:29,768 --> 01:38:31,895
Kindly tell them not to lay a place for me.

790
01:38:31,970 --> 01:38:33,904
Nor for Sara?

791
01:38:33,972 --> 01:38:35,599
Nor for Sara.

792
01:38:40,945 --> 01:38:44,278
Is that rouge I see on your cheek, Mademoiselle?

793
01:38:45,483 --> 01:38:49,749
Powder, madame.
I find it becoming.

794
01:38:54,426 --> 01:38:56,360
Oh, God.

795
01:39:10,075 --> 01:39:13,009
Bye!

796
01:39:13,078 --> 01:39:15,569
Thank you very much for the lovely breakfast!

797
01:39:15,647 --> 01:39:17,774
Bye-bye!

798
01:39:19,584 --> 01:39:21,484
Hope you have a nice holiday!

799
01:39:21,553 --> 01:39:25,716
Bye-bye!

800
01:39:25,790 --> 01:39:27,655
Au revoir!

801
01:39:27,726 --> 01:39:29,990
<i>Frere Jacques
Frere Jacques</i>

802
01:39:30,061 --> 01:39:31,995
Au revoir, mes enfants.

803
01:39:32,063 --> 01:39:35,897
<i>Dormez vous
Dormez vous</i>

804
01:39:35,967 --> 01:39:37,992
Au revoir!

805
01:40:16,007 --> 01:40:19,807
Arthur, my late husband, and I

806
01:40:19,878 --> 01:40:24,372
always took our annual holidays in Bournemouth.

807
01:40:24,449 --> 01:40:27,612
Mmm. It's a delightful place.

808
01:40:27,685 --> 01:40:31,553
Absolutely delightful.
Nothing changed.

809
01:40:31,623 --> 01:40:35,457
Ever.
For 40 years.

810
01:40:35,527 --> 01:40:39,930
The pier, the sands and the people.

811
01:40:39,998 --> 01:40:42,865
And that guest house.

812
01:40:42,934 --> 01:40:45,528
So dependable.

813
01:40:45,603 --> 01:40:49,596
Completely and utterly dependable.

814
01:40:54,045 --> 01:40:55,945
A little more, Mademoiselle?

815
01:40:56,014 --> 01:40:57,948
No, madame.

816
01:40:58,950 --> 01:41:00,918
As you wish.

817
01:41:10,495 --> 01:41:15,159
I came to depend so much on Greta McCraw.

818
01:41:15,233 --> 01:41:18,498
So much masculine intellect.

819
01:41:18,570 --> 01:41:21,437
I came to rely on that woman.

820
01:41:21,506 --> 01:41:23,565
Trust her.

821
01:41:23,641 --> 01:41:27,441
How could she allow herself to be spirited away?

822
01:41:27,512 --> 01:41:30,003
Lost.

823
01:41:30,081 --> 01:41:32,413
Raped.

824
01:41:32,484 --> 01:41:35,544
Murdered in cold blood like a silly schoolgirl

825
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:39,112
on that wretched Hanging Rock.

826
01:41:47,432 --> 01:41:50,993
Will Sara Waybourne be coming back this term, madame?

827
01:41:51,069 --> 01:41:52,969
Oh!

828
01:41:54,172 --> 01:41:56,902
Now where was I?

829
01:41:56,975 --> 01:42:01,435
Oh, yes!
Bournemouth.

830
01:42:01,513 --> 01:42:04,949
What a delightful place!

831
01:42:05,016 --> 01:42:09,043
Nothing changed. Ever.

832
01:42:11,823 --> 01:42:13,757
Dirty kids.

833
01:42:49,594 --> 01:42:51,528
Oh!

834
01:42:51,596 --> 01:42:55,225
Oh! Oh!

835
01:43:08,479 --> 01:43:12,381
Sara! Sara!

836
01:43:28,466 --> 01:43:30,798
<i>The body of Mrs. Arthur Appleyard,</i>

837
01:43:30,868 --> 01:43:32,995
<i>principal of Appleyard College,</i>

838
01:43:33,071 --> 01:43:38,202
<i>was found at the base of Hanging Rock
on Friday the 27th of March, 1900.</i>

839
01:43:38,276 --> 01:43:42,042
<i>Although the exact circumstances of her death 
are not known,</i>

840
01:43:42,113 --> 01:43:46,413
<i>it is believed she fell 
while attempting to climb the rock.</i>

841
01:43:46,484 --> 01:43:49,317
<i>A search for the missing schoolgirls
and their governess</i>

842
01:43:49,387 --> 01:43:54,757
<i>continued spasmodically for the next few years 
without success.</i>

843
01:43:54,826 --> 01:43:59,263
<i>To this day, 
their disappearance remains a mystery.</i>
