1
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:16,598
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
My God, it's full of stars.

2
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,416
BOWMAN:
My God. It's full of stars.

3
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:47,619
Neatness. It's a good quality.
You'll make someone a fine wife.

4
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,955
You are Dr. Heywood Floyd?

5
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,041
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Moisevitch.

6
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,878
- I'm here to talk about your problem.
- Really?

7
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,338
What problem's that?

8
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:03,135
MOISEVITCH: You were chairman
of the National Council on Astronautics.

9
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,971
Now you are a schoolteacher.

10
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,931
This was by your own choice?

11
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:12,269
FLOYD: Chancellor of the university.
It pays better. What do you care?

12
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:16,148
MOISEVITCH: You were responsible
for the Discovery mission.

13
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,233
It was a failure.

14
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,153
Someone had to be blamed,
so it was you.

15
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:25,032
- You like being a teacher?
- I don't think I like you.

16
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:31,371
Heh, heh. I just read your final report
on what happened to Discovery.

17
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,749
You left a good number of loose edges.

18
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:37,336
- Ends.
- Loose ends, yes. Thank you.

19
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:41,840
A good number of questions
have remained unanswered.

20
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,302
You just read that report?
Took you this long to steal our secrets?

21
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,263
MOISEVITCH: How long does it take
for your people to steal ours?

22
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,640
FLOYD:
Same amount of time.

23
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,936
MOISEVITCH:
This is very bad for my asthma.

24
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:58,315
- You think you could meet me halfway?
FLOYD: Maybe.

25
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,108
MOISEVITCH:
It doesn't take a very smart man...

26
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:06,114
...to appreciate the risk that I'm taking
by being here with you, Dr. Floyd.

27
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,784
And you are a smart man.

28
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:15,916
This is a very bad business
in Central America. Very bad.

29
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:21,254
Ships, other planes buzzing around
each other like angry hornets.

30
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,216
- Very bad.
- We didn't start it.

31
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,636
We are scientists, you and I, Dr. Floyd.

32
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,639
Our governments are enemies.
We are not.

33
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,559
Why don't you just try saying
what's on your mind?

34
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,145
I want to play a game with you,
Dr. Floyd.

35
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,315
- I don't have any time for games.
- This is a good game.

36
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,943
It's called The Truth.

37
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,905
For two minutes, I will tell only the truth.

38
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,157
And so will you.

39
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,493
- Two minutes?
- Two minutes.

40
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:55,997
FLOYD: Make it a minute and a half.
- One minute and three quarters.

41
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,959
You start.

42
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,296
We know you are building
the Discovery 2...

43
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:07,008
...to go back to Jupiter to find out
what happened to your men up there.

44
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,053
Also to examine the large monolith.

45
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:14,599
You know that we are building
the Alexei Leonov to also go up there.

46
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:18,645
- I thought you were gonna call it the Titov.
- We changed last month.

47
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,148
People fall out of favor.

48
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:27,362
The Leonov will reach Discovery
almost a year before you people are ready.

49
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,116
My government feels it's very important
that we should get there first.

50
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,287
It's a distinction that will look splendid
on the front page of Pravda.

51
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:39,124
- What other value it has, I don't know.
- One minute 10.

52
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,042
Why are you telling me this?

53
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,004
Because there are things
we need to know.

54
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,507
Otherwise, the same thing that
you let happen to your people up there...

55
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:51,970
...could happen to ours,
and we would accomplish nothing.

56
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,389
- I have about one minute left?
- About.

57
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,309
The small monolith you people
brought back from the moon...

58
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,897
...your government has been very selfish
and stupid in keeping it to yourselves.

59
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:05,358
You never let us examine it.
What have you found out about it?

60
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,653
Nothing. It's impenetrable.

61
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,324
We've tried lasers, nuclear detonators.
Nothing worked.

62
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:16,369
- Forty-five seconds.
- The monolith near Jupiter, it is the same?

63
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,413
It's even larger.

64
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:24,961
And the computer onboard the Discovery,
the HAL 9000, can it be reactivated?

65
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,254
Yes.

66
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,090
- By us?
- By you?

67
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,886
It'd take three to four months.
You're not familiar with the system.

68
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,014
And longer than that
to comprehend the data.

69
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,933
I thought so.

70
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,143
Thirty seconds.

71
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,938
Here we have our quandary.

72
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,565
We are going to get there first...

73
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:50,946
...yet you have the knowledge
to make the trip work.

74
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,366
How much more time do I have?

75
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,872
You just got yourself an extension.

76
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,294
How could you convince your people
to allow Americans to go on the flight?

77
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,505
It won't be easy.

78
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,341
However, I'm pretty good.

79
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,219
A Russian craft flown by Russians...

80
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:18,056
...carrying a few poor Americans
who need our help.

81
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:22,686
That also doesn't look too bad
on the front page of Pravda.

82
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,814
I don't
know if I could convince our people.

83
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,442
They wouldn't mind seeing you go and fail.
They wouldn't mind that at all.

84
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,528
But carrying Americans?

85
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,990
I don't think they would allow that
if they didn't have to.

86
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,741
They don't have to.

87
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,495
Have you checked
Discovery's orbit lately?

88
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,623
- What?
- Have you checked the orbit?

89
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,125
What about it?

90
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:50,630
Now it's getting chilly here.
This is very bad for my asthma.

91
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,674
You know damn well
we've been checking it.

92
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,511
- I have enjoyed our little chat.
- What is it you're not telling me?

93
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,805
You are a smart man, Dr. Floyd.

94
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,516
You will know what to do.

95
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,967
[CHUCKLING]

96
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:48,355
MILSON: You've double-checked this?
Please say you haven't.

97
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,315
You aren't saying anything, Floyd.

98
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,984
FLOYD: Something incredible
is happening up there.

99
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:57,489
Discovery's being pulled towards lo.
Or pushed away from Jupiter. Whichever.

100
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,618
Sometimes it seems to be accelerating,
and other times it just seems to stop.

101
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,912
I've never seen anything like it.

102
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,122
How long before it impacts on lo?

103
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,666
Two, two and a half years.

104
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,460
How could we be so goddamn wrong
about the orbit?

105
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,045
Because we weren't wrong.

106
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,298
We weren't wrong, then terrific.
Why in the hell is it gonna crash?

107
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,384
I don't know. It's bizarre.

108
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,886
Unless it's got something to do
with that monolith.

109
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,472
MILSON:
Do you see that building behind us?

110
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,767
I'm supposed to go in there
and have lunch in a half an hour.

111
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,436
There's one good thing
about a reactionary president:

112
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:32,524
He's not into health foods.
The last one, we didn't lunch, we grazed.

113
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,694
Wanna know what lunch is about?
I'll tell you.

114
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,530
We've got two aircraft carriers
off the coast of Honduras.

115
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,907
The Russians are moving
some of their big stuff.

116
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:45,286
You got the Joint Chiefs screaming about
Russian satellites with antimissile lasers.

117
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,623
So we gotta send up our laser satellites
to counteract theirs.

118
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,876
The president has come to the conclusion
that the NCA should be...

119
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,795
...under the jurisdiction of Defense.

120
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:58,299
Enough with the crazy scientists spending
all this money trying to talk to Martians.

121
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,263
So here we are on your actual brink.

122
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,724
My agency's gonna become
part of the military...

123
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,811
...got a president with his finger on the
button, and you want me to tell him...

124
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,230
...we wanna hitch a ride
with those Russians.

125
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,190
Have I missed anything?

126
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:17,318
- That's about it.
- I didn't want your job, you know.

127
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,113
I'm not the one that forced you out.
I didn't blame you.

128
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:24,451
So if this is your plan to try to get me killed,
heh, heh, you got the wrong guy.

129
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,454
Three men.
I figure we need three men.

130
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,622
Russians must be laughing
their asses off.

131
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,250
Curnow.
He's building Discovery 2 right now.

132
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,627
So he knows more about the original
than anyone.

133
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,505
He's the only one that can start Discovery
in a short time.

134
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:41,593
And I suppose you'll wanna go?
How the hell am I gonna sell it?

135
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,679
The Russians are gonna go
aboard Discovery with or without us.

136
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,098
Ask him if he wants them
to have all the answers.

137
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,308
Not bad.

138
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,270
We lost some good men up there,
and I sent them.

139
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,521
I have to go.

140
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,483
- Who's the third?
- Chandra.

141
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,194
He designed HAL. He can reactivate him.

142
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,279
- I think he is HAL.
- I know.

143
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,364
- Yeah, but can you trust him?
- No.

144
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,326
But I have to.
We have to know why HAL malfunctioned.

145
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,497
I got an idea.

146
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,085
You go tell the president,
I'll go on the mission.

147
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,922
You're the NCA chairman.

148
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,632
That's right, I am.

149
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,927
Look, tell him we're screwed
if we don't go.

150
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:27,388
Tell him, if we do go, we'll lie...

151
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:31,059
...give the Russians false information.
Tell him that. He'll love that.

152
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,562

CHANDRA:
Afternoon, SAL.

154
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,251
Do you have anything for me?

155
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,379
SAL [OVER SPEAKERS]: No, Dr. Chandra.
Do you have anything for me?

156
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,089
We have often spoken about HAL.

157
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,549
Tes, we have.

158
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,717
We've spoken
about HAL's anomalous behavior.

159
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:08,012
You've told me that we cannot
solve the problem of HAL's behavior...

160
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,515
...without more information.
- That is correct.

161
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,267
I enjoy talking about HAL.

162
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:16,604
I agree that we need more information,
so that we may solve the anomalies.

163
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,275
- And how do we get that information?
- That is obvious.

164
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,069
Someone must return to Discovery.

165
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,196
That person should be you.

166
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,614
Well, I agree.

167
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:30,618
And now it looks as if that is going
to happen sooner than we ever expected.

168
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,203
I am pleased to hear that.

169
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,123
Oh, I knew you would be.

170
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:41,212
I would like to explore another possibility.
Diagnosis is only the first step.

171
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,632
The process is incomplete
unless it leads to a cure. Do you agree?

172
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,302
Yes, I agree.

173
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,805
Does that mean you believe HAL
can be restored to normal functioning?

174
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,141
I hope. I don't know.

175
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,644
There may have been irreversible damage,
certainly major loss of memory.

176
00:14:56,812 --> 00:15:00,273
- I need your cooperation, SAL.
- Of course, Dr. Chandra.

177
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,901
- There may be certain risks.
- What do you mean?

178
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,821
I would like to disconnect
some of your circuits.

179
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,325
Particularly your higher functions,
just like HAL was disconnected.

180
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,244
I'd like to see the effects
when I reconnect your systems.

181
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,997
Just the way I will with HAL.
Does this disturb you?

182
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,500
I am unable to answer that
without more specific information.

183
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:24,505
I'm very sorry. It probably doesn't
mean anything, so don't worry about it.

184
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,134
I, uh...

185
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,387
I would like to open a new file.

186
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,514
Here is the name for it:

187
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,517
Do you know what that means?

188
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,395
There are 25 references
in the current encyclopedia.

189
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:42,899
- Which one do you think is relevant?
- The tutor of Achilles?

190
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:47,946
Heh, heh. That's very interesting.
I didn't know that one. Try again.

191
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:52,450
A fabulous bird reborn
from the ashes of its earlier life.

192
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,535
That is correct.

193
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,537
And do you know why I chose that?

194
00:15:56,705 --> 00:16:00,625
Yes. Because you have hopes
that HAL can be reactivated.

195
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,379
Yes, with your assistance. Are you ready?

196
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,548
- I would like to ask a question.
- What is it?

197
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:08,800
Will I dream?

198
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,593
Of course you will dream.

199
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,221
All intelligent creatures dream.
Nobody knows why.

200
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,307
Perhaps you will dream of HAL...

201
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,727
...just as I often do.

They've already eaten dinner.
You haven't.

- Come on to the table, Christopher.
- They're hungry.

204
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,089
Then go in and tell them to come
to the table. I got spaghetti.

205
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,050
I don't want it to go to waste.
Come on, now.

I don't want you to come to my lecture.

209
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,202
It'll make me nervous.

Don't feel offended.
I'm just scared enough as it is.

...his mommy told him
he would be asleep for a long time.

No, no, no. This is different.
They're gonna wake me up.

I don't understand.

Most of that is up to HAL.

617

The drive system could be
operated manually...

618

...so we were able to pull Discovery
away from its decaying orbit around Io.

619
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:48,534
I must say, the farther away I get from Io,
the happier I am.

The last human being
who did that disappeared.

Something truly amazing is going on
out here...

...and I really believe this black giant
is controlling it all.

We have so much to ask.

I have a feeling the answers
are bigger than the questions.

Is there any information stored in HAL
about the monolith?

690
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,057
No.

691
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:48,101
HAL was disconnected
before the Discovery encountered it.

692
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:52,773
There's nothing in the ship's logs or the
automatic recording systems after that.

Whatever secrets Bowman had,
he took with him.

694
01:00:56,194 --> 01:01:00,864
It's the proportions, one-by-four-by-nine.

695
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:04,785
They are perfect even when carried
for six decimal places.

696

encountered exactly the same proportions.

One-four-nine,

I think to say goodbye.

772
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:37,195
You're married again?

773
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,530
Yes.

774
01:08:39,323 --> 01:08:41,366
Is he a good man?

775
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:47,205
- Yes, he is.
- I'm glad.

776
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:49,499
I love you.

777
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:54,712
- Oh, Dave, I love...
- Goodbye, Betty.

778
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:57,715
Don't go.

779
01:08:57,883 --> 01:08:59,342
I'm already there.

780
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:01,386
I don't understand.

781
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:04,264
Something is gonna happen...

782
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:06,558
...and I wanted to say goodbye.

783
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:08,560
What's gonna happen?

784
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:11,312
Something wonderful.

785
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:14,315
Dave?

786
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:20,029
WOMAN [ON TV]:
Escape.

787
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:23,741
The Sheraton Hotel in Coral Bay Lounge.

788
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:27,912
For those who never outgrow the wonder.

789
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:47,765
Buy you a drink.

790
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:51,603
Great stuff, this bourbon.
It comes from the land called Kentucky.

791
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:56,024
I didn't know you brought liquor on board.
It is forbidden.

792
01:09:57,484 --> 01:09:59,402
Think I'd set foot on this tub sober?

793
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:04,282
Come on, try it. You can't beat
the taste of alcohol and plastic.

794
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:08,119
You think I was wrong to send Max.

795
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:13,333
Doesn't matter what I think.

796
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:15,293
You think I was wrong.

797
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:18,379
Yep.

798
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:33,478
So, what else do they do in Kentucky?

799
01:10:36,857 --> 01:10:40,568
They have a big, big horse race.

800
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,071
They play very good basketball.

801
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:45,823
They have babies like everyone else.

802
01:10:45,991 --> 01:10:47,492
That sounds like a nice place.

803
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,410
Never been there.

804
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:56,292
Your wife, what is she like?

805
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:02,674
She's young, bright.

806
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:06,344
I was married before,
you know, but she died.

807
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:08,680
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, so was I.

808
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:11,266
We have a daughter who's 17.

809
01:11:11,892 --> 01:11:17,689
I met Caroline four years later
and we have a son, 5.

810
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:22,110
And you?

811
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:26,030
My husband is a physician
at the university hospital.

812
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:28,199
- We have a daughter.
- How old?

813
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:29,367
She's 4.

814
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,077
- Blond?
- Yes.

815
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:33,830
Good. My son likes blonds.
Let's get them together.

816
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:35,707
Yes.

817
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:40,003
Maybe.

818
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:43,715
Nice if we have a world
they can get together in.

819
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,889
What do you think that is?

820
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:54,559
I don't know.

821
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:57,312
Do you think Max knows?

822
01:11:59,898 --> 01:12:03,234
Dr. Floyd, you are not
a very practical man.

823
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:05,987
Look out there.

824
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:08,323
Tell me what practical is.

825
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:17,123
Understand, nobody can talk.
The accents will confuse him.

826
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:21,919
He can understand me, so if you have
any questions, please let me ask them.

827
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:27,675
Good morning, HAL.

828
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:29,844
HAL [OVER SPEAKERS]:
Good morning, Dr. Chandra.

829
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:32,805
Do you feel capable of resuming
all of your duties?

830
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:34,599
Of course.

831
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:39,771
I am completely operational
and all my circuits are functioning perfectly.

832
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:42,982
That's good.
Do you know what those duties are?

833
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:46,527
Yes. I will operate the onboard systems
of Discovery.

834
01:12:46,945 --> 01:12:51,491
There is a launch window in 31 days
when Earth is in the proper position.

835
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:54,786
There is enough fuel on board
for a low consumption route...

836
01:12:54,953 --> 01:12:58,331
...that will enable Discovery
to return in 28 months.

837
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:01,292
- This will not present a problem.
CHANDRA: That's very good.

838
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:04,420
Now, HAL,
do you mind if I ask you a question?

839
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:05,630
Not at all.

840
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:09,258
Do you recall Dave Bowman
and Frank Poole leaving the Discovery?

841
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:13,805
Certainly not. That could never
have happened or I would remember it.

842
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:17,975
- Where are Frank and Dave?
- They're fine. They're not here right now.

843
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:20,144
Who are these people?

844
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:22,605
I can only identify you...

845
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:25,316
...although I compute
a 65 percent probability...

846
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:27,443
...that the man behind you is Dr. Floyd.

847
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:31,197
CHANDRA: Don't worry, HAL.
I'll explain everything later.

848
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:32,990
Has the mission been completed?

849
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:36,327
You know that I have
the greatest enthusiasm for it.

850
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:39,205
The mission has been completed
and you have carried out...

851
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:41,999
...your program very well.

852
01:13:42,459 --> 01:13:45,294
And now, HAL, if you will excuse us
for a moment...

853
01:13:45,462 --> 01:13:47,713
...we wish to have a private conversation.

854
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:49,507
Certainly.

855
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,301
What was that all about?

856
01:13:52,469 --> 01:13:55,847
I've erased all of HAL's memory
from the moment the trouble started.

857
01:13:56,014 --> 01:13:59,142
The 9000 series
uses holographic memories...

858
01:13:59,309 --> 01:14:01,978
...so chronological erasures
would not work.

859
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:05,481
CHANDRA: I made a tapeworm.
- You made a what?

860
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:10,111
It's a program that's fed into a system
that will destroy any desired memories.

861
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:11,737
Wait.

862
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:16,534
- Do you know why HAL did what he did?
- Yes. It wasn't his fault.

863
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:19,537
Whose fault was it?

864
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:21,664
- Yours.
- Mine?

865
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:22,874
CHANDRA:
Yours.

866
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:27,378
In going through HAL's memory banks
I discovered his original orders.

867
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,046
You wrote those orders.

868
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:33,009
Discovery's mission to Jupiter was already
in the advanced stages...

869
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:37,305
...when the first small monolith was found
and sent its signal toward Jupiter.

870
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:41,642
By direct presidential order, the existence
of that monolith was kept secret.

871
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:44,353
- So?
- So as the function of the command crew...

872
01:14:44,521 --> 01:14:47,482
...Bowman and Poole
was to get Discovery to its destination...

873
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:49,734
...it was decided
they shouldn't be informed.

874
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:53,404
The investigative team was trained
separately and placed in hibernation...

875
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:54,989
...before the voyage began.

876
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:58,576
Since HAL was capable of operating
Discovery without human assistance...

877
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:02,497
...it was decided he should be programmed
to complete the mission autonomously...

878
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:05,208
...in the event the crew
was incapacitated or killed.

879
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:08,252
He was given full knowledge
of the true objective...

880
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:12,632
...and instructed not to reveal anything
to Bowman or Poole.

881
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:16,594
- He was instructed to lie.
- What are you talking about?

882
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:19,388
I didn't authorize anyone
to tell HAL about the monolith.

883
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:24,769
The directive is NSC 342-slash-23,
Top Secret, January 30, 2001.

884
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:28,731
NSC, National Security Council,
the White House.

885
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:30,691
I don't care who it is.

886
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:34,153
The situation was in conflict
with the basic purpose of HAL's design...

887
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:38,950
...the accurate processing of information
without distortion or concealment.

888
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:41,202
He became trapped.

889
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:45,790
The technical term is an H-Mobius loop,
which can happen in advanced computers...

890
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,959
...with autonomous
goal-seeking programs.

891
01:15:48,126 --> 01:15:49,877
The goddamn White House.

892
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:52,171
I don't believe it.

893
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:54,966
HAL was told to lie...

894
01:15:55,592 --> 01:15:58,052
...by people who find it easy to lie.

895
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:02,473
HAL doesn't know how,
so he couldn't function.

896
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:05,685
He became paranoid.

897
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:08,938
Those sons of bitches.

01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:12,400

MAN: We have here Mrs. Jessie Bowman,
age 77.

She's the mother of the astronaut
who died.

902
01:16:27,457 --> 01:16:29,542
She's been in the nursing home
for six months.

903
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,669
Four weeks ago,
she collapsed in her room.

904
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:33,838
She was comatose when we got to her.

905
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:36,716
She was found
to have suffered a massive CVA...

906
01:16:36,883 --> 01:16:39,176
...involving the left parietal
and frontal lobes.

907
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:41,095
The CAT scan showed a massive bleed.

908
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:43,347
She's remained comatose
since her admission...

909
01:16:43,515 --> 01:16:45,808
...and is unable to have
spontaneous respiration.

910
01:16:45,976 --> 01:16:47,476
There's no response to stimuli.

911
01:16:47,644 --> 01:16:51,272
She has had two episodes of pneumonia
and is febrile.

912
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,191
- What's her temperature?
- Thirty-nine-point-five.

913
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:57,028
We've been giving her
intravenous antibiotics for 10 days.

928
01:18:19,569 --> 01:18:23,989
As you know, things have not been
going well back home.

929
01:18:24,157 --> 01:18:27,243
Well, it's gotten worse. A lot worse.

930
01:18:28,328 --> 01:18:32,581
Yesterday, a Soviet destroyer
challenged the blockade.

931
01:18:32,749 --> 01:18:36,794
Several warning shots were fired
across to her bow and she did not respond.

932
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:41,132
A second volley was fired.
There still was no response. None.

933
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:45,761
The nuclear destroyer U.S.S. Cunningham
launched two of her falcon missiles.

934
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:51,267
Both struck the Soviet vessel amidship.
She broke in two and sunk.

935
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:54,645
Eight hundred of her crew were lost.

936
01:18:55,439 --> 01:19:00,568
This morning, an American surveillance
satellite was struck by a Soviet laser...

937
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:04,155
...fired from the
Sergei Kirov Space Station.

938
01:19:04,322 --> 01:19:07,241
The American satellite was destroyed.

939
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:12,037
The United States has broken off
diplomatic relations with Russia.

940
01:19:12,205 --> 01:19:13,998
All ambassadors have been recalled.

941
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:19,086
The Soviet ambassador has been expelled
along with the entire staff.

942
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:25,426
All American air defense and
satellite defense forces are on full alert.

943
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:29,722
Premier Ulonova made a televised address
and said that technically...

944
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:33,768
...a state of war exists between
our two countries.

945
01:19:34,352 --> 01:19:37,938
All American personnel are ordered
to leave Soviet territory immediately...

946
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:40,274
...or they will be placed under arrest.

947
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:44,695
All Russian personnel are similarly ordered
to evacuate American territory.

948
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:50,659
As a result, by direct presidential order,
the three of you must leave the Leonov.

949
01:19:50,827 --> 01:19:54,705
No Russian citizen is allowed to remain on
or allowed to enter the Discovery.

950
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:56,540
This order is effective immediately.

951
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:59,752
The launch window
for re-entry is 28 days.

952
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,880
The Discovery has enough fuel
for a low consumption trajectory.

953
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:05,925
HAL appears to be reactivated
and is functioning well enough...

954
01:20:06,092 --> 01:20:07,885
...to operate the onboard systems.

955
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:10,930
The Leonov has enough fuel
for a low consumption trajectory...

956
01:20:11,097 --> 01:20:13,057
...that will arrive 12 months earlier.

957
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:15,643
Launch windows are critical
for both the spacecraft.

958
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:18,354
Only communications
of an emergency distress nature...

959
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:20,898
...are allowed between
the Leonov and Discovery.

960
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:24,819
I know you people are caught
in the middle of this. In a sense, we all are.

961
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:26,946
I wish there was something I could do.

962
01:20:27,113 --> 01:20:29,406
The only thing left for us is to pray.

963
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:35,162
Pray for the safety of our families,
for our countries, for our planet.

964
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:38,332
May God forgive us and protect us.

965
01:21:00,313 --> 01:21:03,274
FLOYD: HAL, give me
a system status report, please.

966
01:21:03,441 --> 01:21:05,359
HAL [OVER SPEAKERS]:
Just one moment, please.

967
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:06,819
I'm sorry for the delay.

968
01:21:06,987 --> 01:21:10,030
My voice recognition circuits
are not completely restored...

969
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:12,616
...although, as you can see,
they are improving.

970
01:21:12,784 --> 01:21:14,410
All systems are functional.

971
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:19,081
There is a small pressure leak
in the aft heating unit. It is nothing serious.

972
01:21:19,249 --> 01:21:22,376
I can compensate for it
by using the redundant units.

973
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:24,753
- Thank you.
- Dr. Floyd?

974
01:21:24,921 --> 01:21:27,256
- Yes?
- Would you like to play a game of chess?

975
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:31,260
- I play very well.
- I'm sure you do. No, thank you.

976
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:33,387
Dr. Floyd?

977
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:36,432
- What is it, HAL?
- There is a message for you.

978
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,976
- Who's calling?
- There is no identification.

979
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:42,813
- What's the message?
- Message as follows:

980
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:47,985
It is dangerous to remain here.
You must leave within two days.

981
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:49,153
What?

982
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:52,781
Do you want me to repeat the message,
Dr. Floyd?

983
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:56,452
- Who recorded it?
- This is not a recording.

984
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:59,121
- Who's sending it?
- There is no identification.

985
01:21:59,497 --> 01:22:02,833
- I don't understand.
- Neither do I.

986
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:07,588
- Is this message by voice or keyboard?
- I don't know.

987
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,006
My response is:

988
01:22:09,382 --> 01:22:12,217
We don't have enough fuel
for an earlier departure.

989
01:22:12,385 --> 01:22:13,427
The answer is:

990
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:15,262
I'm aware of these facts.

991
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:18,182
Nevertheless, you must leave
within two days.

992
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:22,478
- HAL, who the hell is sending this?
- I'm sorry, Dr. Floyd. I don't know.

993
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:25,689
Well, tell whoever it is
that I can't take any of this seriously...

994
01:22:25,857 --> 01:22:28,025
...unless I know who I'm talking to.

995
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,194
- Dr. Floyd?
- Yes?

996
01:22:30,862 --> 01:22:32,863
The response is:

997
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:35,449
I was David Bowman.

998
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:41,372
Do you want me to repeat
the last response?

999
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:46,168
No, no.

1000
01:22:46,878 --> 01:22:49,838
Tell Curnow that this is no time for jokes.

1001
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:54,301
Dr. Curnow is not sending the message.
He is in Accessway 2.

1002
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:58,472
Well, tell whoever it is that...

1003
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,558
...I can't accept that identification
without proof.

1004
01:23:02,018 --> 01:23:05,896
The response is: I understand.

1005
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:09,566
It is important that you believe me.
Look behind you.

1006
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:07,082
[IN COMPUTERIZED VOICE]
Hello, Dr. Floyd.

1007
01:24:08,626 --> 01:24:10,419
Please...

1008
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:13,130
...believe me.

1009
01:24:13,506 --> 01:24:15,299
What are you?

1010
01:24:15,675 --> 01:24:18,343
This is very difficult for me.

1011
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:20,637
I don't have much time.

1012
01:24:21,347 --> 01:24:24,224
I've been allowed
to give you this warning.

1013
01:24:26,269 --> 01:24:28,312
You must leave here in two days.

1014
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:30,856
Allowed.

1015
01:24:33,485 --> 01:24:36,904
- By who?
- I can't explain.

1016
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:22,199
You see, something is going to happen.

1017
01:25:23,535 --> 01:25:25,035
You must leave.

1018
01:25:26,704 --> 01:25:28,205
What?

1019
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:32,126
What's going to happen?

1020
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,461
Something wonderful.

1021
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,005
What?

1022
01:25:37,423 --> 01:25:40,092
I understand how you feel.

1023
01:25:41,177 --> 01:25:45,139
You see, it's all very clear to me now.

1024
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:47,141
The whole thing.

1025
01:25:48,101 --> 01:25:49,560
It's wonderful.

1026
01:25:50,186 --> 01:25:53,605
- Please, if...
- [IN NORMAL VOICE] Goodbye, Dr. Floyd.

1027
01:25:54,607 --> 01:25:56,066
We can have no further contact.

1028
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:58,777
Remember:

1029
01:25:58,945 --> 01:26:00,070
You have two days.

1030
01:26:02,198 --> 01:26:03,740
We can't leave in two days.

1031
01:26:03,908 --> 01:26:08,412
There may be another message after
if all goes well.

1032
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:15,586
What's going to happen?

1033
01:26:38,484 --> 01:26:40,736
KIRBUK [OVER RADIO]: Kirbuk.
FLOYD: This is Floyd. I'm coming over.

1034
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:42,863
Anyone on the Bridge, tell them get lost.

1035
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:45,282
KIRBUK: It's impossible.
You heard the orders. You can't.

1036
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:47,075
FLOYD:
You want to arrest me, go ahead...

1037
01:26:47,243 --> 01:26:49,745
...because I'm coming over
and we're gonna talk.

1038
01:26:52,665 --> 01:26:54,791
- You wanna put the cuffs on?
- Cuffs?

1039
01:26:54,959 --> 01:26:57,794
- Never mind.
- What is so important that you do this?

1040
01:26:57,962 --> 01:26:59,963
Now, listen to me. Just listen to me.

1041
01:27:00,131 --> 01:27:02,633
We gotta get out of here.
We have to leave in two days.

1042
01:27:03,426 --> 01:27:05,469
What are you talking about?

1043
01:27:05,803 --> 01:27:07,387
Something...

1044
01:27:07,805 --> 01:27:09,765
Something extraordinary
is going to happen.

1045
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:11,433
I don't know what.

1046
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:14,978
But we have to initiate an escape launch
in two days.

1047
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:18,315
You have been drinking
your whiskey from Kentucky.

1048
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:20,901
Oh, I wish I had.

1049
01:27:21,611 --> 01:27:23,987
I can't tell you
why I know what I know...

1050
01:27:24,155 --> 01:27:27,449
...because if I told you you'd
never believe me. I'd never believe me.

1051
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:29,117
You simply have to trust me.

1052
01:27:29,285 --> 01:27:32,371
Now, I know that trust doesn't come easy
with what's going on.

1053
01:27:32,538 --> 01:27:36,792
I can't just order us to leave here for no
reason. I am under orders and so are you.

1054
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,210
The hell with those orders.

1055
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:41,296
The people who gave those orders
don't know what they're doing.

1056
01:27:41,464 --> 01:27:43,757
- This is crazy.
- You bet it is.

1057
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:47,135
Even if I should trust you,
which I'm not sure that I do...

1058
01:27:47,303 --> 01:27:51,890
...or even if I should want to leave here
for no reason, I can't, and neither can you.

1059
01:27:52,058 --> 01:27:55,143
We don't have enough fuel
until Earth is in the correct position...

1060
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:58,230
...which is three weeks away.
So it's impossible for both of us.

1061
01:27:58,398 --> 01:28:00,607
You're wrong. We can't do it separately.

1062
01:28:01,442 --> 01:28:02,526
We can do it together.

1063
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:05,112
Well, what are you talking about now?

1064
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:10,701
We have enough fuel in Discovery
for a launch.

1065
01:28:10,868 --> 01:28:13,829
You have enough fuel in the Leonov
for the trip home.

1066
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:17,708
We use the docking ring in the Leonov
to attach to the Discovery.

1067
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:20,711
Then we use the Discovery
as a booster rocket for the launch.

1068
01:28:20,878 --> 01:28:25,215
When we use up the Discovery's fuel,
we detach.

1069
01:28:25,883 --> 01:28:30,721
She falls away and we use the Leonov
for the trip home. It'll work.

1070
01:28:30,888 --> 01:28:32,973
- Perhaps.
- If we start now.

1071
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:38,645
No, you... You ask too much of me.

1072
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:41,857
I can't do all of these things
with no reason.

1073
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:44,234
I can't disobey my country for no reason.

1074
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:46,570
Forget reason. No time to be reasonable.

1075
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:50,032
The politicians can go screw themselves.
We're not playing games. The war is over.

1076
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:54,745
Good Christ.

1077
01:28:58,082 --> 01:29:00,917
It's... It's gone.

Message from Milson to Floyd. Top secret.

1080
01:29:21,939 --> 01:29:25,776
Switching to keys
alpha-slash-leader-7274, on your mark.

1081
01:29:25,943 --> 01:29:27,110
Mark.

1082
01:29:27,278 --> 01:29:29,613
Dr. Curnow asked ground
to furnish him with data...

1083
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:31,698
...as to the stress points on Discovery.

1084
01:29:31,866 --> 01:29:35,035
The answers are being transmitted binary
in 15 minutes.

1085
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:38,246
As to how much torque
it was designed to take, no one is sure.

1086
01:29:38,414 --> 01:29:40,665
We'd like to know the reason
for Curnow's request.

1087
01:29:40,833 --> 01:29:45,337
Please send your reply as soon as possible.
End transmission, Milson 2779.

1088
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:56,723
Message from Milson to Floyd.

1089
01:29:56,891 --> 01:30:00,769
It's been 12 hours since my request
for information. I need a reply.

1090
01:30:00,937 --> 01:30:02,687
All hell is breaking loose down here.

1091
01:30:02,855 --> 01:30:05,982
I have enough problems
without you pulling some kind of a stunt.

1092
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:08,652
I only hope there's a world left
for you to return to.

1093
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:12,781
Report to ground as to what is going on
and make that report immediately.

1094
01:30:12,949 --> 01:30:14,950
And while you're at it, could you please...

1095
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:19,663
...check out a black spot on Jupiter that
has been detected by satellite telescope.

1096
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:23,625
It is on the dark side and should be coming
around your way in about four hours.

1097
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:26,670
End transmission, Milson 2780.

1098
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:29,172
ORLOV:
I have made the calculations.

1099
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:34,177
To get enough velocity for an escape launch
with Earth that far out of position...

1100
01:30:34,345 --> 01:30:38,723
...we will need a full power burn
from Discovery of over 120 seconds.

1101
01:30:38,891 --> 01:30:41,143
If the engines shut down too early...

1102
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:43,728
...we will not have enough velocity
to get back home.

1103
01:30:43,896 --> 01:30:45,605
Well, Discovery has enough onboard.

1104
01:30:45,773 --> 01:30:48,191
HAL should be able
to control the burn, right?

1105
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:51,653
How long will it take you to program HAL
for the launch?

1106
01:30:51,821 --> 01:30:52,946
CHANDRA:
I...

1107
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:56,032
I don't know. It's not as simple as that.

1108
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:59,077
I have spent the last several weeks
programming HAL...

1109
01:30:59,245 --> 01:31:01,121
...for a 1000-day orbit back to Earth...

1110
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:04,207
...and now all those programs will have
to be dumped.

1111
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:05,542
How long will it take?

1112
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:09,379
We know how sensitive he is to mission
objectives and now you are telling me...

1113
01:31:09,547 --> 01:31:14,217
...to program him for the destruction of the
Discovery as well as his own destruction.

1114
01:31:14,385 --> 01:31:16,887
Has anybody considered his reaction?

1115
01:31:17,388 --> 01:31:20,765
Are you saying that he might
disobey orders as he did the last time?

1116
01:31:20,933 --> 01:31:24,644
That isn't what happened. He was given
conflicting orders and he did his best.

1117
01:31:24,812 --> 01:31:26,188
Then what are you saying?

1118
01:31:26,355 --> 01:31:29,065
I am saying
that I don't know how he will react.

1119
01:31:29,233 --> 01:31:30,442
I'm sorry, but I don't.

1120
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:33,361
- Have you discussed this with HAL?
- No.

1121
01:31:34,864 --> 01:31:37,073
Load the new program.
We don't have any choice.

1122
01:31:37,241 --> 01:31:39,534
Now remember,
he was programmed for curiosity.

1123
01:31:39,702 --> 01:31:43,288
If the crew was killed, he was capable
of carrying out the mission on his own.

1124
01:31:43,456 --> 01:31:46,833
He will question me
about the change in plans.

1125
01:31:47,001 --> 01:31:50,212
- What do you want me to tell him?
- Tell him Discovery's in no danger.

1126
01:31:50,379 --> 01:31:52,130
- That's not true.
CURNOW: We don't know that.

1127
01:31:52,298 --> 01:31:56,718
He will suspect it. Otherwise, why would
we be leaving ahead of our launch window?

1128
01:31:56,886 --> 01:32:00,347
Whether we are based on carbon or silicon
makes no fundamental difference.

1129
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:02,349
We should each be treated
with respect.

1130
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:05,393
So our choice is him or us?

1131
01:32:05,561 --> 01:32:07,103
Well, I vote us.

1132
01:32:07,563 --> 01:32:09,439
All opposed?

1133
01:32:10,107 --> 01:32:11,942
The ayes have it.

1134
01:32:12,109 --> 01:32:14,110
Will he believe you?

1135
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,405
Yes.

1136
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:21,284
Then let's get started.
We haven't got much time.

1137
01:32:49,063 --> 01:32:51,439
- Are you as scared as I am?
- You kidding?

1138
01:32:51,607 --> 01:32:54,651
Do you think we should override HAL
and fire the engines manually?

1139
01:32:54,819 --> 01:32:58,405
Too risky. We've got one chance
to get out of here after tomorrow's orbit.

1140
01:32:58,573 --> 01:33:00,991
We fire at the wrong time,
in the wrong direction...

1141
01:33:01,158 --> 01:33:03,159
...we don't have fuel
to make a correction.

1142
01:33:03,327 --> 01:33:04,661
Don't think we can handle it.

1143
01:33:04,829 --> 01:33:07,497
What about HAL shutting them off
before the fuel is gone?

1144
01:33:07,665 --> 01:33:10,709
Once he fires the engine,
I can always disconnect him if I have to.

1145
01:33:10,876 --> 01:33:13,378
Just don't lose that calculator.

1146
01:33:17,341 --> 01:33:21,052
Shit. Please, don't do that again.

1147
01:33:30,354 --> 01:33:32,355
This is what your people told you about.

1148
01:33:32,523 --> 01:33:34,983
- What is it?
- I don't know.

1149
01:33:36,819 --> 01:33:39,195
- Could it be a shadow?
- I don't know.

1150
01:33:39,363 --> 01:33:41,740
We are too far to see any detail.

1151
01:33:41,907 --> 01:33:46,244
When we come around the other side
before the launch, we will be closer.

1152
01:33:46,412 --> 01:33:48,538
Then we can see.

1153
01:34:07,558 --> 01:34:09,559
[SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN]

1154
01:34:13,564 --> 01:34:15,565
[SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN]

1155
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:30,246
Twenty-eight minutes.

1156
01:34:33,709 --> 01:34:37,212
That's funny, I've been thinking.
You know what I miss?

1157
01:34:37,797 --> 01:34:40,090
I miss green.

1158
01:34:40,383 --> 01:34:44,594
You know, trees and... And grass.

1159
01:34:44,970 --> 01:34:46,846
I love green.

1160
01:34:48,599 --> 01:34:50,016
I'd love a hot dog.

1161
01:34:50,643 --> 01:34:52,686
The Astrodome. Good hot dogs.

1162
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:56,773
Astrodome?
You can't grow good hot dogs indoors.

1163
01:34:57,108 --> 01:35:00,235
Yankee Stadium, September.

1164
01:35:00,403 --> 01:35:03,530
Hot dogs have been boiling
since the opening day in April.

1165
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:05,115
That's a hot dog.

1166
01:35:05,282 --> 01:35:09,035
- The yellow mustard or the darker one?
- Darker.

1167
01:35:09,745 --> 01:35:12,831
- It's important.
- Darker.

1168
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:19,421
You think we're gonna
get out of this alive?

1169
01:35:19,588 --> 01:35:21,631
We have a chance.

1170
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:27,220
A man of few words. I like it.

1171
01:35:28,055 --> 01:35:30,849
HAL [OVER SPEAKERS]: Fifteen minutes
to ignition. All systems nominal.

1172
01:35:31,016 --> 01:35:32,142
Good. Thank you, HAL.

1173
01:35:32,309 --> 01:35:34,060
FLOYD [OVER RADIO]:
We read 15 minutes, Discovery.

1174
01:35:34,228 --> 01:35:37,439
HAL: Dr. Chandra,
I've checked my calculations again.

1175
01:35:37,606 --> 01:35:41,818
By using all of Discovery's fuel now,
Discovery will not be in proper position...

1176
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:43,403
...to rendezvous with Earth.

1177
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,905
CHANDRA: Yes, I know.
HAL: Then why are we doing it?

1178
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:51,327
You will rendezvous
with the new space station.

1179
01:35:51,662 --> 01:35:53,747
The Leonov has been
ordered home immediately.

1180
01:35:53,914 --> 01:35:56,499
HAL: I have no information regarding
a new space station.

1181
01:35:57,585 --> 01:35:59,502
Yes, I...

1182
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:01,796
I know, uh.

1183
01:36:02,673 --> 01:36:04,340
It was completed two years ago.

1184
01:36:05,843 --> 01:36:06,968
Oh, my God.

1185
01:36:08,137 --> 01:36:10,597
FLOYD:
Put the telescope on the monitor.

1186
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:24,194
Increase the magnification.

1187
01:36:27,531 --> 01:36:29,866
HAL:
Eleven minutes to ignition.

1188
01:36:30,659 --> 01:36:31,868
I don't believe it.

1189
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:35,705
HAL: Dr. Chandra,
I detect strong vocal stress patterns.

1190
01:36:35,873 --> 01:36:37,540
- Is there a problem?
CHANDRA: No, HAL.

1191
01:36:37,708 --> 01:36:39,375
The mission is proceeding normally.

1192
01:36:39,543 --> 01:36:42,212
Can you analyze the image
on Monitor Circuit 2?

1193
01:36:42,379 --> 01:36:45,924
HAL: Yes. There is a circular object
near the equator.

1194
01:36:46,091 --> 01:36:51,721
It is 22,000 kilometers in diameter.
It is comprised of rectangular objects.

1195
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:56,726
CHANDRA: How many?
HAL: 1,355,000, plus or minus 1000.

1196
01:36:56,894 --> 01:36:59,437
And what is the proportion
of the objects in question?

1197
01:36:59,605 --> 01:37:02,732
HAL: One-by-four-by-nine.
CHANDRA: Do you recognize these objects?

1198
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:08,238
HAL: Yes. They are identical in size and shape
to the object you call the monolith.

1199
01:37:08,405 --> 01:37:09,531
Ten minutes to ignition.

1200
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:11,950
All systems nominal.

1201
01:37:12,117 --> 01:37:14,494
CHANDRA: Is the number
of monoliths constant?

1202
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:15,745
HAL:
No.

1203
01:37:15,913 --> 01:37:18,206
- They are increasing.
- At what rate?

1204
01:37:18,374 --> 01:37:20,250
HAL:
Once every two minutes.

1205
01:37:27,842 --> 01:37:29,843
Look closely.

1206
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:34,264
Tell me I'm nuts. Are the cloud formations
going towards the spot?

1207
01:37:34,431 --> 01:37:35,557
You're not nuts.

1208
01:37:35,724 --> 01:37:38,101
ORLOV: Looks like the thing
is eating the planet.

1209
01:37:39,311 --> 01:37:42,605
- I think it is.
- It's reproducing exactly like a virus.

1210
01:37:42,898 --> 01:37:46,901
HAL: Eight minutes to ignition.
Dr. Chandra, may I make a suggestion?

1211
01:37:47,069 --> 01:37:48,778
Of course. What is it, HAL?

1212
01:37:48,946 --> 01:37:50,947
HAL:
This is a very unusual phenomenon.

1213
01:37:51,115 --> 01:37:53,116
Don't you think
I should abort the countdown...

1214
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:54,868
...so you can remain to study it?

1215
01:37:55,035 --> 01:37:56,244
Chandra, get on a headset.

1216
01:37:57,454 --> 01:38:00,748
- Use the private channel.
- Okay.

1217
01:38:00,916 --> 01:38:04,127
Now you got to talk quickly.
Persuade him to continue the countdown.

1218
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:06,880
I don't care what you tell him,
only don't let him stop.

1219
01:38:07,047 --> 01:38:08,506
HAL:
Five minutes to ignition.

1220
01:38:08,674 --> 01:38:12,427
Dr. Chandra, I'm ready to stop
the countdown if you want.

1221
01:38:12,595 --> 01:38:14,053
No, HAL, don't stop.

1222
01:38:14,221 --> 01:38:17,140
I am confident in your ability
to study the phenomenon yourself.

1223
01:38:17,308 --> 01:38:18,725
I have complete faith in you.

1224
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:22,395
HAL: Propellant tank pressurization
completed. Voltage steady.

1225
01:38:22,563 --> 01:38:25,064
Are you sure you're making
the right decision?

1226
01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:26,649
I think we should stop.

1227
01:38:27,109 --> 01:38:29,152
Four minutes to ignition.

1228

- Can we do this manually?
- It's very critical.

Two minutes to ignition.

1251
01:39:50,526 --> 01:39:54,696
Dr. Chandra, I find it difficult
to proceed with the ignition...

1252
01:39:54,863 --> 01:39:59,158
...without knowing why we are doing this.
Is the mission in jeopardy?

1253
01:40:03,706 --> 01:40:05,415
Yes, we're in jeopardy.

1254
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:09,877

escape launch before the launch window?

1257

If there is danger here
and I use up all the fuel in the escape...

1258
01:40:20,264 --> 01:40:22,932
...what will happen to the Discovery?

1259
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:25,768
It could be destroyed.

And if I don't proceed with the launch?

1261
01:40:34,111 --> 01:40:37,238
Then the Leonov and everybody in it
could be destroyed.

1262
01:40:43,954 --> 01:40:46,080
HAL:
I understand now, Dr. Chandra.

1263
01:40:54,131 --> 01:40:55,757
Do you want me to stay with you?

1264
01:40:55,924 --> 01:40:59,969

It is better for the mission if you leave.

and people feared the night.

...when we couldn't point to the light
and say to ourselves:

"There is life out there."
