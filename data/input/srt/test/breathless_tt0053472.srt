1
00:00:36,134 --> 00:00:39,549
After all... I'm stupid.

2
00:00:39,634 --> 00:00:43,799
After all, yes, I must. I must!

3
00:01:50,762 --> 00:01:54,469
- Michel! Take me with you!
- What time is it?

4
00:01:54,553 --> 00:01:57,011
- 10:50.
- No.

5
00:01:57,095 --> 00:01:59,844
I'm on my way, hey-hey!

6
00:02:13,987 --> 00:02:15,862
<i>Buenas noches,</i>

7
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,364
<i>mi amor...</i>

8
00:02:19,388 --> 00:02:24,678
If he thinks he's gonna pass me
in that crappy thing!

9
00:02:25,697 --> 00:02:27,072
Pa... Pa... Patricia!

10
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:28,739
Patricia!

11
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:36,012
I pick up the cash,

12
00:02:36,096 --> 00:02:40,346
I ask Patricia, yes or no, and then...

13
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:43,614
<i>Buenas noches, mi amor!</i>

14
00:02:44,072 --> 00:02:46,531
Milano, Genova, Roma!

15
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,804
The countryside's nice.

16
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:07,014
I really like France.

17
00:03:11,473 --> 00:03:15,014
If you don't like the sea,

18
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:18,389
if you don't like the mountains,

19
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:24,639
if you don't like the city,
then get stuffed!

20
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:34,848
Little girls trying to hitch a ride!

21
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:37,556
I'll charge a kiss per kilometer.

22
00:03:39,224 --> 00:03:42,973
The short one's not bad.
Nice thighs.

23
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:46,015
But the other one...

24
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:49,306
Shit, they're too ugly.

25
00:04:12,725 --> 00:04:15,432
The sun is beautiful.

26
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:26,267
Women are such cowards
behind the wheel. Overtake him!

27
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:28,725
Oh, there's roadwork’s.

28
00:04:39,018 --> 00:04:41,225
Never use the brakes.

29
00:04:41,309 --> 00:04:45,767
As old Bugatti said:
"Cars are made to run, not to stop."

30
00:04:47,476 --> 00:04:48,933
Shit! Cops!

31
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:05,809
The wire's come off!

32
00:05:06,685 --> 00:05:10,226
This could get me nabbed!

33
00:05:25,145 --> 00:05:28,602
Don't move, or I'll waste you.

34
00:06:20,397 --> 00:06:25,521
- Miss Franchini's room?
- She isn't here. She's out.

35
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,730
Girls never have any cash!

36
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,605
Espresso.

37
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:45,813
- How much is ham and eggs?
- 1.80.

38
00:06:48,023 --> 00:06:51,772
- Right. I'll have some.
- OK.

39
00:06:52,606 --> 00:06:55,438
Just going for a paper.

40
00:07:17,107 --> 00:07:20,356
- Oh, wow, Michel!
- Can I come in?

41
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,856
- How are you, sweetheart?
- No jacket?

42
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,648
I left it in my Alfa Romeo.

43
00:07:26,732 --> 00:07:33,565
- Want breakfast at the Royal?
- I must be at the TV station by 9:10.

44
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:42,024
It's torn. Listen to this.

45
00:07:50,108 --> 00:07:55,149
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing, I've been travelling.

46
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:57,983
What's new around here?

47
00:07:58,067 --> 00:08:03,150
- You don't go out?
- To the discotheque sometimes.

48
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:07,441
- Still making films?
- No. You need to sleep around.

49
00:08:07,526 --> 00:08:09,316
Do you recollect Enrico?

50
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:14,150
"Remember" or "recall",
not "recollect".

51
00:08:14,234 --> 00:08:18,316
I work with him at the station.
I'm a script-girl.

52
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:23,775
When I was broke in December,
I was assistant on a film at Cinecittà!

53
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:25,526
You?

54
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,484
Ever been a gigolo?
I was just asking.

55
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:34,651
I wouldn't mind.

56
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,984
Call me back in a few minutes.

57
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:44,942
Is Gaby back from Spain?

58
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:48,109
He's bought the Pergola.

59
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:52,027
Great. It was stupid
to paint it all black.

60
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:57,027
- What's it say there?
- "Why?"

61
00:08:57,194 --> 00:09:01,527
Never finished it.
I smoke Luckies now.

62
00:09:01,611 --> 00:09:06,818
- Can you lend me 5000 francs till noon?
- I might have known.

63
00:09:07,986 --> 00:09:11,943
- You're a creep, Michel.
- I'll pay you back.

64
00:09:12,028 --> 00:09:15,527
I don't have that much.

65
00:09:15,611 --> 00:09:19,778
- Here's 500 if you want.
- No, keep it.

66
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:48,070
- So, no breakfast at the Royal?
- I'm really late.

67
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:50,737
Okay, then.

68
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,404
- Is Mr Tolmachov here?
- He's here, but he's not here.

69
00:09:59,946 --> 00:10:03,737
- Seen Patricia?
- Yes, over there.

70
00:10:11,572 --> 00:10:14,155
Come with me to Rome?

71
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:21,488
It's crazy, I wanted to see
if I'd be glad to see you again.

72
00:10:21,572 --> 00:10:23,780
Have you been in Monte Carlo?

73
00:10:23,864 --> 00:10:28,280
No, Marseilles. I was in Monte Carlo
before that to see a guy.

74
00:10:28,364 --> 00:10:32,988
- I called on Monday, from Marseilles.
- I was out of town.

75
00:10:35,614 --> 00:10:39,364
- I'll take one.
- That's kind.

76
00:10:43,657 --> 00:10:49,989
- You said you hated Paris.
- No, I said I've got enemies here.

77
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:54,281
- So you're in danger?
- Yes, I am. Will you come to Rome?

78
00:10:54,365 --> 00:10:57,406
To do what?

79
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:02,781
- No, I've things to do here.
- You going up or down the Champs?

80
00:11:02,865 --> 00:11:07,032
- What's the "Champs"?
- The Champs Elysées.

81
00:11:07,908 --> 00:11:13,573
I'm going to Avenue George V.
Go on, walk with me.

82
00:11:13,658 --> 00:11:16,490
Just to the corner.

83
00:11:26,074 --> 00:11:31,824
Here, no horoscope! It's the future.
I want to know the future.

84
00:11:31,909 --> 00:11:35,824
- Don't you?
- Sure.

85
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:44,783
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, just looking at you.

86
00:11:47,075 --> 00:11:53,074
- You angry I left without a goodbye?
- No, I was furious because I was sad.

87
00:11:54,492 --> 00:11:58,117
It's nice to wake up next to a girl.

88
00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:01,950
Are you staying in town?

89
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:04,825
I have to see a man who owes me money.

90
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:10,700
- Then I have to see you.
- You don't have to.

91
00:12:10,993 --> 00:12:14,700
- There are prettier girls than me.
- No.

92
00:12:14,785 --> 00:12:19,450
I slept with two girls since you.
It was a washout.

93
00:12:20,868 --> 00:12:27,243
- What's "washout"?
- They were pretty, but it was no fun.

94
00:12:27,327 --> 00:12:32,076
So will you come to Rome?
I'm fed up with France.

95
00:12:32,161 --> 00:12:37,410
I have to enroll at the Sorbonne
so my parents will send money.

96
00:12:37,494 --> 00:12:41,410
- We only had 3 nights together!
- No, 5.

97
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:46,743
- Why don't you wear a bra?
- Don't be rude!

98
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:52,869
- What time is it? See you later?
- Not later. Tonight. Okay?

99
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:56,702
- Yes. Where?
- Round here.

100
00:13:15,037 --> 00:13:17,952
LIVE DANGEROUSLY UNTIL THE END!

101
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:30,870
- Sir? You've nothing against youth?
- I have. I like old people.

102
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,163
POLICEMAN'S KILLER IDENTIFIED

103
00:14:00,914 --> 00:14:05,413
- Is Mr Tolmachov here?
- At the airline desk.

104
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,705
Hi, amigo.

105
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:30,539
- You came by at ten?
- Yeah, for my money.

106
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:47,998
I got bored down south.
I came up to see a girl.

107
00:14:48,082 --> 00:14:53,206
- I'm rusting away here.
- Better rusted than busted.

108
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,373
Over here.

109
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:06,374
Do you have the envelope I gave you?

110
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:17,791
- Idiot! Why did he cross it?
- Just sign it over to someone else.

111
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,582
Not to me.
I blew my last penny on the races.

112
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:27,249
- And your pal, Bob Montagné?
- He's in prison.

113
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:32,167
- There's Berruti, but I don't trust him.
- I thought he was your pal.

114
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:36,917
- Is he back?
- Yes, I saw him last night.

115
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:47,958
- What was his number again?
- Elysée 99-84.

116
00:15:48,043 --> 00:15:51,792
- Can I call from here?
- Go ahead.

117
00:15:54,751 --> 00:15:59,501
- Who's the girl you came for?
- A New Yorker.

118
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:03,001
She's amusing. I like her.

119
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:06,959
Elysée 99-84?

120
00:16:07,752 --> 00:16:10,626
I'd like to speak to Antonio.

121
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:14,876
I see. No, I'll call back.

122
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,376
He's out. I'll ask around.

123
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:23,209
- Bye, sonny.
- Ciao, amigo.

124
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:34,044
- Inter-Americana Agency?
- Yes, that's us.

125
00:16:34,128 --> 00:16:38,210
- Do customers have mail sent here?
- Yes.

126
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:42,502
- Know a certain Michel Poiccard?
- No.

127
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:45,627
Also goes by the name Laszlo Kovacs?

128
00:16:45,711 --> 00:16:49,877
Ask that gentleman.
He'll help you.

129
00:17:03,796 --> 00:17:06,253
If it isn't Tolmachov!

130
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:09,461
Hello, Inspector.

131
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:14,211
- In the travel business now?
- As you can see.

132
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:21,587
Remember how you grassed
on your friend Bob?

133
00:17:21,672 --> 00:17:26,837
- What of it?
- Well, you're going to do it again.

134
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:32,879
Michel Poiccard, 1 metre 79,
brown hair, former Air France steward.

135
00:17:32,963 --> 00:17:37,712
- He has his mail sent here.
- Yes, I know him.

136
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:41,504
- He been around lately?
- No.

137
00:17:41,588 --> 00:17:43,754
Miss!

138
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:53,213
Nobody been to see
Mr Tolmachov recently?

139
00:17:53,298 --> 00:17:58,630
- Just 5 minutes ago, quite a tall man.
- Bloody hell!

140
00:18:00,089 --> 00:18:03,047
Accessory to murder. Think about it!

141
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,089
THE HARDER THEY FALL

142
00:18:37,174 --> 00:18:39,089
Bogey...

143
00:19:17,092 --> 00:19:21,841
I saw a man die.
An accident.

144
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:26,550
- Take me out to dinner?
- Evidently.

145
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:31,425
Let me make another call first.
Wait for me?

146
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:38,009
- Call from the restaurant.
- No. I'll just be a second.

147
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:42,884
The French always say one second
when they mean 5 minutes.

148
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:40,886
- Where we going?
- Anywhere. To Saint Michel.

149
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,011
Sleep with me tonight?

150
00:20:44,095 --> 00:20:47,511
- Don't you like it with me?
- Sure, I do.

151
00:20:47,595 --> 00:20:52,886
I just read something in the paper.
About a bus conductor.

152
00:20:52,971 --> 00:20:57,554
He stole 5 million to seduce a girl.
Impersonated a rich impresario.

153
00:20:57,638 --> 00:21:01,720
He took her down to the Riviera.
They blew the lot in 3 days.

154
00:21:01,805 --> 00:21:05,679
The guy didn't chicken out.
He told her:

155
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:10,054
"It's stolen money, I'm a bad guy,
but I like you."

156
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:16,304
It's great she stuck by him.
She said: "I like you, too."

157
00:21:16,388 --> 00:21:21,471
They came back to Paris,
and were caught burgling villas.

158
00:21:21,556 --> 00:21:25,138
She was the look-out.

159
00:21:27,097 --> 00:21:32,721
- Excuse me, got a light?
- Go buy yourself some matches!

160
00:21:32,806 --> 00:21:37,263
- I forgot! I have an appointment.
- Who with?

161
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:41,930
A journalist on the Champs Elysees.
It's a press conference.

162
00:21:42,014 --> 00:21:48,931
- Where? Now?
- You can really get on my nerves.

163
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:53,347
- So you're leaving me?
- But I'll see you tomorrow.

164
00:21:53,432 --> 00:21:55,806
Not tomorrow, tonight, Patricia.

165
00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:00,681
- I told you I can't.
- Why are you so cruel?

166
00:22:00,765 --> 00:22:07,972
- Any taxis around?
- My car's near the Opera. Want a lift?

167
00:22:08,057 --> 00:22:13,640
- What happened to the Ford?
- It's in the garage.

168
00:22:13,724 --> 00:22:18,390
- Let me stay with you.
- I've got a headache anyway.

169
00:22:18,474 --> 00:22:23,765
- We won't make love.
- That's not it, Michel!

170
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:33,057
- Why are you so sad?
- Because I am.

171
00:22:33,141 --> 00:22:35,265
That's silly.

172
00:22:36,766 --> 00:22:39,473
Why are you sad?

173
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:44,433
- Should I use "vous" or "tu"?
- Either. But I can't do without you.

174
00:22:44,517 --> 00:22:48,516
- Yes, you can.
- Maybe. But I don't want to.

175
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:54,849
Look at that great Talbot. A 2.5 litre.

176
00:22:55,684 --> 00:22:59,933
- You're a kid...
- What?

177
00:23:00,017 --> 00:23:05,933
- Oh, I don't know.
- I forbid you to meet this guy.

178
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:14,267
Alas, alas, alas!

179
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:18,434
I love a girl who has a nice neck,
nice breasts,

180
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:24,809
a nice voice, nice wrists,
a nice forehead, nice knees.

181
00:23:29,518 --> 00:23:32,642
But she's such a coward!

182
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:39,935
- It's there. Stop.
- I'll park.

183
00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:45,060
Get lost then!

184
00:23:45,144 --> 00:23:49,310
I never want to see you again.
Get lost!

185
00:23:51,686 --> 00:23:54,476
Get lost, you creep!

186
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:46,603
- I'd be sad if that happened to you.
- We'll see.

187
00:24:46,688 --> 00:24:49,853
What's wrong?

188
00:24:49,938 --> 00:24:53,896
If I could dig a hole
and hide in it, I would.

189
00:24:53,980 --> 00:25:00,354
You should be like an elephant.
When they're sad, they vanish.

190
00:25:11,522 --> 00:25:15,646
Let me tell you a story.
It'll take your mind off things.

191
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:19,854
I've known a girl 2 years.
And now, I suddenly think:

192
00:25:19,939 --> 00:25:23,855
I'll ask her to sleep with me.
It had never occurred to me.

193
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:29,897
We met for lunch. I wanted to say:
"We're friends, let's sleep together."

194
00:25:29,981 --> 00:25:34,897
I don't know why,
but it completely slipped my mind!

195
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,022
Later I sent her a telegram,

196
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:43,730
saying I'd forgotten to say
we should sleep together.

197
00:25:43,815 --> 00:25:47,940
3 hours later I get
a message back, saying:

198
00:25:48,024 --> 00:25:50,690
"What an amazing coincidence!

199
00:25:50,774 --> 00:25:55,023
I was going to suggest the same thing!"

200
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,943
- Is this the late edition?
- Yes, sir.

201
00:28:29,655 --> 00:28:34,446
- My key isn't here?
- You must've left it in the door.

202
00:28:39,488 --> 00:28:41,779
Oh, no!

203
00:28:44,197 --> 00:28:48,946
- What are you doing here?
- The Claridge was fully booked.

204
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:53,071
So I came here.
I took the key downstairs.

205
00:28:53,155 --> 00:28:59,238
- There are other hotels.
- I always stay at the Claridge.

206
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:02,072
You're crazy!

207
00:29:02,156 --> 00:29:05,405
- Don't sulk!
- I can never be alone...

208
00:29:05,489 --> 00:29:08,155
It doesn't suit you.

209
00:29:09,698 --> 00:29:12,947
- What's "sulk"?
- This.

210
00:29:19,823 --> 00:29:22,948
It suits me fine.

211
00:29:23,032 --> 00:29:25,281
You're even crazier than me.

212
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:32,073
What a pain. I always fall for girls
who aren't for me.

213
00:29:32,157 --> 00:29:36,823
Did you notice
I followed you last night?

214
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:44,364
- What's wrong?
- Leave me alone. I'm thinking.

215
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,614
What about?

216
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:51,449
The thing is, I don't even know.

217
00:29:51,533 --> 00:29:55,407
- Well, I do.
- No, nobody does.

218
00:29:55,491 --> 00:29:59,074
You're thinking about last night.

219
00:29:59,158 --> 00:30:04,324
Last night I was furious,
but now I couldn't care less.

220
00:30:04,408 --> 00:30:08,074
I'm not thinking about anything.

221
00:30:11,658 --> 00:30:16,033
I'd like to think about something,
but I can't seem to.

222
00:30:16,117 --> 00:30:20,241
Well, I'm tired, very tired,

223
00:30:20,326 --> 00:30:23,575
and I'm going back to sleep.

224
00:30:29,034 --> 00:30:33,491
- Why are you looking at me?
- Because I am.

225
00:30:33,576 --> 00:30:37,158
- You should've stayed last night.
- I couldn't.

226
00:30:37,242 --> 00:30:41,492
You should've told the chap
you couldn't see him.

227
00:30:41,577 --> 00:30:47,076
I had to. He's getting me articles
to write. It's really important for me.

228
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,534
What's important
is going to Rome with me.

229
00:30:50,618 --> 00:30:53,951
Maybe, I don't know.

230
00:30:54,035 --> 00:30:57,659
- Did you sleep with him?
- No.

231
00:30:57,743 --> 00:31:02,284
- I bet you did.
- No. He's really sweet.

232
00:31:02,368 --> 00:31:06,534
He said one day we'd sleep together,
but not now.

233
00:31:06,618 --> 00:31:11,827
- But he doesn't even know me.
- Not you. Him and me.

234
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:18,327
- We had a drink in Montparnasse.
- I was there, too. At what time?

235
00:31:18,411 --> 00:31:22,535
I don't know. We didn't stay long.

236
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:26,452
Why did you come here, Michel?

237
00:31:26,536 --> 00:31:33,243
- I want to sleep with you again.
- That's hardly a reason.

238
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:39,369
- Sure it is. It means I love you.
- But I don't know yet if I love you.

239
00:31:40,412 --> 00:31:44,578
- When will you know?
- Soon.

240
00:31:44,662 --> 00:31:51,369
- In a month, in a year?
- Soon means soon.

241
00:31:51,454 --> 00:31:54,286
A woman never wants to do
in eight seconds

242
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:58,078
what she'll want to do
eight days later.

243
00:31:58,162 --> 00:32:01,912
Eight seconds or eight days,
it's all the same.

244
00:32:01,996 --> 00:32:07,454
- Why not eight centuries?
- No, eight days is good.

245
00:32:08,496 --> 00:32:11,662
A woman's all half-measures.

246
00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:14,495
It gets me down.

247
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:18,995
Why won't you sleep with me again?

248
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:25,454
Because I'm trying to find out
what it is that I like about you.

249
00:32:25,538 --> 00:32:31,455
- I want us to be like Romeo and Juliet.
- Just like a girl!

250
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:37,246
You said last night you couldn't
live without me, but you can.

251
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:42,330
Romeo couldn't live without Juliet,
but you can.

252
00:32:42,414 --> 00:32:46,163
No, I can't live without you.

253
00:32:46,247 --> 00:32:50,163
Just like a man!

254
00:32:50,247 --> 00:32:53,205
Give me a smile.

255
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:56,872
Right. I'll count to 8.

256
00:32:56,957 --> 00:33:01,581
If by 8 you haven't smiled,
I'll strangle you.

257
00:33:02,957 --> 00:33:04,747
Two.

258
00:33:04,832 --> 00:33:06,497
Three.

259
00:33:06,582 --> 00:33:08,789
Four, five, six.

260
00:33:08,873 --> 00:33:10,664
Seven.

261
00:33:10,748 --> 00:33:12,956
Seven and a half.

262
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,872
Seven and three quarters.

263
00:33:15,957 --> 00:33:20,622
You're such a coward
I bet you're gonna smile.

264
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:27,623
Enough games for today.

265
00:33:30,416 --> 00:33:34,373
- Too bad you're a coward.
- Why do you say that?

266
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:38,165
- You get on my nerves.
- And you get on mine.

267
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:41,457
- I'm not a coward.
- How do you know I'm scared?

268
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:45,832
If a girl says she's not scared,
then can't even light her cigarette,

269
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:52,124
it means she's scared of something.
I don't know of what, but she's scared.

270
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,541
- Have one.
- None of those Chesterfields.

271
00:33:57,625 --> 00:34:00,416
Hand me my jacket.

272
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,249
- In this one?
- Give it here!

273
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:09,416
- This is your passport?
- My brother's. Mine's in the car.

274
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:15,292
- But it says Kovacs here.
- He's not my real brother.

275
00:34:15,376 --> 00:34:20,042
My mum was divorced
by the time he was born.

276
00:34:28,376 --> 00:34:30,959
See? I'm not scared.

277
00:34:31,043 --> 00:34:35,750
- I never said you were.
- You bet, pet.

278
00:34:36,793 --> 00:34:42,043
But you wish you had said it.
And now you're angry.

279
00:34:42,127 --> 00:34:45,751
I'm not talking to you anymore.

280
00:34:50,711 --> 00:34:56,501
Do you ever think about death?
I do, all the time.

281
00:34:58,794 --> 00:35:02,960
- What?
- Say something nice.

282
00:35:03,044 --> 00:35:06,376
- Like what?
- I don't know.

283
00:35:06,461 --> 00:35:09,586
Then neither do I.

284
00:35:11,128 --> 00:35:16,086
- I like your ashtray.
- It's Swiss.

285
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:20,127
My granddad had a Rolls-Royce.
Great car!

286
00:35:20,212 --> 00:35:24,294
Never had to raise the bonnet
in 15 years!

287
00:35:25,753 --> 00:35:29,252
Seen my new poster?

288
00:35:29,337 --> 00:35:34,919
Come here!
Come here, for Christ's sake!

289
00:35:35,003 --> 00:35:39,087
It won't do here. Where can I put it?

290
00:35:41,254 --> 00:35:44,212
Why did you slap me
when I looked at your legs?

291
00:35:44,296 --> 00:35:46,837
It wasn't my legs.

292
00:35:48,963 --> 00:35:50,962
It's exactly the same thing.

293
00:35:51,046 --> 00:35:55,920
The French always say things
are the same when they're not at all.

294
00:35:57,629 --> 00:36:01,753
- I've thought of something nice.
- What?

295
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:06,171
I want to sleep with you again
because you're beautiful.

296
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,671
I'm not.

297
00:36:08,755 --> 00:36:13,546
- Then because you're ugly.
- Is it the same?

298
00:36:18,589 --> 00:36:20,963
Yeah, baby, it's the same.

299
00:36:21,047 --> 00:36:25,004
- You're a liar, Michel.
- No, lying's stupid.

300
00:36:25,089 --> 00:36:28,546
It's like at poker...
It's better to tell the truth.

301
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:34,047
The others think you're bluffing,
and that's how you win.

302
00:36:34,131 --> 00:36:36,714
What is it?

303
00:36:39,506 --> 00:36:44,130
I'll stare at you
until you stop staring at me.

304
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:16,090
I'm going to put my poster
in the bathroom.

305
00:37:16,174 --> 00:37:19,798
- Can I phone?
- Yes.

306
00:37:22,925 --> 00:37:26,674
- It's not bad here.
- Just fine.

307
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:37,507
- Do you like this poster?
- It's not bad.

308
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:44,049
- Renoir's a really great painter.
- I said, not bad!

309
00:37:45,633 --> 00:37:49,508
Think she's prettier than me?

310
00:37:51,218 --> 00:37:55,967
When you're scared or surprised,
or both at once...

311
00:37:56,051 --> 00:37:59,383
...there's a funny glint in your eyes.

312
00:37:59,468 --> 00:38:04,133
I want to sleep with you again,
because of that glint.

313
00:38:08,176 --> 00:38:11,133
Mind if I piss in the sink?

314
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:16,301
- Guess what I'm going to say.
- No idea.

315
00:38:16,385 --> 00:38:19,468
I'm pregnant, Michel.

316
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,343
You heard me.

317
00:38:25,427 --> 00:38:29,509
- Whose is it? Mine?
- I think so.

318
00:38:29,594 --> 00:38:33,468
- Seen a doctor?
- Yesterday.

319
00:38:33,552 --> 00:38:37,509
I have to go back Thursday for tests.

320
00:38:37,594 --> 00:38:41,176
You should've been more careful!

321
00:38:54,636 --> 00:39:00,510
Get me Elysée 99-84.
99-84.

322
00:39:04,053 --> 00:39:08,094
Is Antonio there?

323
00:39:08,178 --> 00:39:14,303
You don't know if he's coming back?
I'll call back.

324
00:39:14,387 --> 00:39:17,011
Michel Poiccard.

325
00:39:24,387 --> 00:39:27,178
Elysée 25-32.

326
00:39:29,471 --> 00:39:33,636
I'm calling
the man who owes me money.

327
00:39:35,304 --> 00:39:38,096
Mr Tolmachov, please.

328
00:39:39,638 --> 00:39:42,221
Hey, sonny.

329
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:49,596
I can't find Berruti.

330
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,887
I wandered
around Montparnasse all night.

331
00:39:56,097 --> 00:39:58,179
The police?

332
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,805
Thanks. Ciao, sonny.

333
00:40:05,431 --> 00:40:06,888
Shit!

334
00:40:06,973 --> 00:40:10,055
- What?
- I slipped.

335
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:14,472
Heard the one
about the condemned man?

336
00:40:14,556 --> 00:40:19,680
As he's climbing the scaffold,
he slips and says, "that figures!"

337
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:31,598
- You look like a Martian up close.
- Because my head's in the clouds.

338
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:35,973
- Some idea, having a kid!
- But it's not sure.

339
00:40:36,057 --> 00:40:38,139
I wanted to see what you'd say.

340
00:40:38,224 --> 00:40:41,556
- Take your clothes off.
- What's the point?

341
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,014
You Americans are so stupid.

342
00:40:45,099 --> 00:40:49,014
You adore La Fayette
and Maurice Chevalier.

343
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:54,598
And they're the stupidest Frenchmen!
I'm making another call.

344
00:40:57,266 --> 00:40:59,349
Belle Epine 35-26.

345
00:40:59,433 --> 00:41:02,015
Patricia, come here!

346
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:07,432
Hello, Mr Mansard?

347
00:41:07,516 --> 00:41:13,640
Will he be in this afternoon?
Tell him I'll come by.

348
00:41:13,725 --> 00:41:16,974
I'm a friend of Tony's. From Marseilles.

349
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:20,557
Laszlo Kovacs. I've got an American.

350
00:41:22,933 --> 00:41:26,558
- An American?
- Laszlo Kovacs.

351
00:41:27,726 --> 00:41:32,933
Not you. An American car.

352
00:41:37,434 --> 00:41:42,350
I can't find the man
who owes me money. What a pain!

353
00:41:42,434 --> 00:41:47,558
- Do you prefer records or the radio?
- Quiet, I'm thinking!

354
00:42:04,977 --> 00:42:09,267
- I know them all so well.
- How old are you?

355
00:42:09,352 --> 00:42:15,517
- I'll put the radio on. I'm 20.
- You don't look it.

356
00:42:15,602 --> 00:42:20,143
- Why don't you like music?
- It depends. I do.

357
00:42:20,269 --> 00:42:23,393
Come on, Patricia, come to Italy.

358
00:42:27,186 --> 00:42:31,143
What's the point of studying
at the Sorbonne?

359
00:42:31,228 --> 00:42:34,393
You never took any exams.

360
00:42:34,478 --> 00:42:38,602
Sure, the baccalaureate.
But I packed it in.

361
00:42:38,686 --> 00:42:43,603
- What's "packed it in"?
- I did other things.

362
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:46,769
- I sold cars.
- Here?

363
00:42:46,854 --> 00:42:49,686
No.

364
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:55,686
In New York,
did you sleep with a lot of men?

365
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:59,644
Not so many.

366
00:42:59,729 --> 00:43:02,353
How many?

367
00:43:03,479 --> 00:43:06,603
- How about you?
- Me?

368
00:43:08,645 --> 00:43:11,937
Not so many either.

369
00:43:12,021 --> 00:43:18,312
You know where I'd like to live?
Mexico. I hear it's really lovely.

370
00:43:18,396 --> 00:43:22,895
When I was a kid my dad would say:
We'll go next Saturday.

371
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,687
But he'd always forget.

372
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:32,604
No, Mexico doesn't grab me.
I bet it's not all that great.

373
00:43:32,688 --> 00:43:38,355
People are such liars.
It's like Stockholm. Everyone says...

374
00:43:38,439 --> 00:43:43,480
"Swedish girls are terrific.
I had 3 a day. Go there."

375
00:43:43,564 --> 00:43:47,105
I went there. It's not true.

376
00:43:47,189 --> 00:43:50,480
Swedish girls don't act
the way they do here.

377
00:43:50,564 --> 00:43:53,813
Most of them are dogs
like Parisian girls.

378
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:57,605
No, Swedish girls are very pretty.

379
00:43:57,689 --> 00:44:00,646
It's a myth.

380
00:44:00,731 --> 00:44:06,397
One or two maybe, like in Paris
or London, but not all of them.

381
00:44:06,523 --> 00:44:10,439
The cities where the girls are pretty,

382
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:14,731
not gorgeous, but like you, charming,

383
00:44:14,857 --> 00:44:21,147
girls who rate 15 out of 20,
because they have something...

384
00:44:22,815 --> 00:44:28,981
Aren't Rome or Paris or Rio
but Lausanne and Geneva.

385
00:44:31,399 --> 00:44:37,232
- Now you tell me something nice.
- I don't know what, either.

386
00:44:40,983 --> 00:44:44,732
Would you let another man caress you?

387
00:44:47,858 --> 00:44:51,815
You know, you said I'm scared.

388
00:44:51,899 --> 00:44:57,274
It's true, I'm scared.
Because I want you to love me.

389
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:02,816
But at the same time,
I want you to stop loving me.

390
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,649
I'm very independent, you know.

391
00:45:08,609 --> 00:45:12,399
I love you.
But not the way you think.

392
00:45:12,484 --> 00:45:15,733
- How then?
- Not the way you think.

393
00:45:15,817 --> 00:45:19,983
But you don't know what I think.
You don't know.

394
00:45:20,067 --> 00:45:23,483
- Yes, I do.
- No, it's impossible.

395
00:45:23,567 --> 00:45:29,484
I want to know
what's behind your face.

396
00:45:29,568 --> 00:45:34,692
I've looked at it for 10 minutes,
and I still know nothing.

397
00:45:34,776 --> 00:45:38,817
I'm not sad. I'm scared.

398
00:45:38,901 --> 00:45:41,109
Sweet, gentle Patricia.

399
00:45:41,193 --> 00:45:46,109
OK, then, cruel, stupid,
heartless, pathetic...

400
00:45:46,193 --> 00:45:49,400
...cowardly, despicable.
- Yes.

401
00:45:49,485 --> 00:45:55,860
You don't even how to apply
your lipstick. Now you're hideous.

402
00:45:55,944 --> 00:46:00,985
Say what you like, I don't care.
I'll put all this in my book.

403
00:46:01,069 --> 00:46:04,110
- What book?
- I'm writing a novel.

404
00:46:04,236 --> 00:46:08,485
- You?
- Why not me? What are you doing?

405
00:46:08,569 --> 00:46:11,901
- Taking off your top.
- Not now.

406
00:46:11,986 --> 00:46:16,026
You're a bloody pain! What is all this?

407
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:19,069
You know William Faulkner?

408
00:46:19,153 --> 00:46:24,736
- Who's he? Someone you slept with?
- No way, Jose!

409
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:28,361
To hell with him, then!
Take off your top.

410
00:46:28,445 --> 00:46:32,152
He's one of my favourites.
Have you read Wild Palms?

411
00:46:32,237 --> 00:46:39,152
- Take off your top, I said.
- The last sentence is beautiful.

412
00:46:45,363 --> 00:46:49,528
"Between grief and nothing,
I will take grief."

413
00:46:49,613 --> 00:46:54,112
- Which would you choose?
- Let me see your toes.

414
00:46:54,238 --> 00:46:58,028
Toes are important in a woman.
Don't laugh.

415
00:46:58,113 --> 00:47:02,653
- Which would you choose?
- Grief's stupid.

416
00:47:02,738 --> 00:47:04,528
I'd choose nothing.

417
00:47:04,654 --> 00:47:09,445
It's not better,
but grief's a compromise.

418
00:47:09,529 --> 00:47:14,238
I want all or nothing.
And now I know.

419
00:47:14,322 --> 00:47:18,071
Now I do.
Why are you shutting your eyes?

420
00:47:18,155 --> 00:47:22,154
I'm shutting my eyes tight
so everything goes black.

421
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:26,071
But I can't do it.
It's never entirely black.

422
00:47:26,155 --> 00:47:32,571
Your smile, seen in profile,
it's the nicest thing about you.

423
00:47:32,655 --> 00:47:36,279
- That's you.
- That's me!

424
00:47:46,073 --> 00:47:50,739
We look each other in the eyes,
and it means nothing.

425
00:47:52,656 --> 00:47:55,239
Patricia Franchini.

426
00:47:55,323 --> 00:47:59,989
I hate that name.
I'd like to be called Ingrid.

427
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:05,740
Kneel for me.

428
00:48:05,824 --> 00:48:09,781
What's wrong?

429
00:48:09,866 --> 00:48:15,198
- I'm looking at you.
- The French are stupid, too.

430
00:48:22,491 --> 00:48:26,698
- I want you to stay with me.
- OK.

431
00:48:26,782 --> 00:48:32,824
We interrupt our programming
in order to synchronize our networks.

432
00:48:39,242 --> 00:48:43,199
Funny, I can see
my reflection in your eyes.

433
00:48:43,283 --> 00:48:46,532
A real Franco-American reconciliation.

434
00:48:46,617 --> 00:48:49,241
We're hiding like happy elephants.

435
00:48:49,325 --> 00:48:53,991
- Women's hips move me somehow.
- It's hot under here.

436
00:49:06,493 --> 00:49:12,117
If it was another man caressing you,
would you mind?

437
00:49:12,201 --> 00:49:15,950
Our musical program is about to start.

438
00:49:37,202 --> 00:49:39,284
There!

439
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:55,327
You know Dylan Thomas'
Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog?

440
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,994
Sunday morning is most satisfying

441
00:50:02,078 --> 00:50:06,160
to have a really long lie-in.

442
00:50:06,245 --> 00:50:09,160
I'm getting dressed.

443
00:50:09,245 --> 00:50:12,452
- What time is it?
- Noon.

444
00:50:12,536 --> 00:50:14,744
Was it good?

445
00:50:16,911 --> 00:50:21,286
- Let's stay in bed.
- Nope, I've got to buy a dress.

446
00:50:21,371 --> 00:50:25,411
- Have you got your car?
- Yeah.

447
00:50:27,162 --> 00:50:30,286
Good morning, Michel.

448
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:41,203
Elysée 99-84.

449
00:50:46,205 --> 00:50:48,287
Hello.

450
00:50:49,538 --> 00:50:51,912
Good morning.

451
00:50:51,997 --> 00:50:55,454
Has Antonio been back?

452
00:50:55,538 --> 00:50:59,704
Oh, no. This is unbelievable!

453
00:51:01,497 --> 00:51:04,746
You don't know where he is?

454
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:09,829
No, never mind.
Michel Poiccard again.

455
00:51:09,913 --> 00:51:12,538
Want me to wear a bra?

456
00:51:20,581 --> 00:51:26,330
Which do you like best:
My eyes, my mouth or my shoulders?

457
00:51:26,414 --> 00:51:29,538
If you had to choose.

458
00:51:34,081 --> 00:51:40,206
- There was no press conference.
- No, it's at Orly in a little while.

459
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:45,081
I'm not much of a looker,
but I'm quite a boxer!

460
00:51:48,999 --> 00:51:51,914
Going to your press conference?

461
00:51:51,999 --> 00:51:56,081
- I have to drop by the office first.
- I'll come with you.

462
00:51:56,165 --> 00:51:58,539
Eisenhower, with General de Gaulle,

463
00:51:58,624 --> 00:52:02,956
will lay a wreath
on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

464
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,874
- Were you in the army?
- Yes.

465
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:11,124
- What did you do?
- I did in the sentries.

466
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:16,332
- "Did in"?
- I laid them out flat like this.

467
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:25,249
- I'm exhausted. I'm gonna die.
- You're crazy.

468
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:28,415
Yeah, totally barmy.

469
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:33,083
- What's "barmy"?
- I am.

470
00:52:51,292 --> 00:52:55,333
- Your car's not here?
- Yes... No... Yes.

471
00:52:55,417 --> 00:52:58,417
It's at the garage.

472
00:53:21,877 --> 00:53:24,459
Great, a Ford!

473
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:36,418
- What floor?
- Fifth.

474
00:53:56,754 --> 00:53:59,878
I got the wrong floor.

475
00:54:29,713 --> 00:54:33,879
- Scared of getting old? I am.
- You're stupid!

476
00:54:36,963 --> 00:54:41,129
I told you,
the worst flaw is cowardice.

477
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:47,046
- Will you buy me a Dior dress?
- No way!

478
00:54:47,172 --> 00:54:49,963
There are nicer dresses
at the supermarket.

479
00:54:50,047 --> 00:54:52,880
You make calls at Dior.

480
00:54:52,964 --> 00:54:58,088
It's the only place
where you can phone for free.

481
00:54:58,172 --> 00:55:02,088
France Soir! France Soir!

482
00:55:09,422 --> 00:55:14,839
- Give me one!
- Here you go.

483
00:55:14,923 --> 00:55:16,672
Thank you.

484
00:55:16,757 --> 00:55:19,964
- I'll take one, please.
- Yes, sir.

485
00:55:27,173 --> 00:56:14,640
POLICE KILLER STILL AT LARGE

486
00:56:14,675 --> 00:56:18,341
- How long will it last?
- Half an hour or so.

487
00:56:18,425 --> 00:56:21,549
I'll go and see my guy, then.

488
00:56:40,718 --> 00:56:44,884
Why did you call your novel "Candida"?

489
00:56:46,343 --> 00:56:49,884
I'm sure that the French
will give my book

490
00:56:49,968 --> 00:56:53,675
a cool reception
because of their prudishness.

491
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,342
Mr Parvulesco!

492
00:56:58,843 --> 00:57:03,801
Can one still believe
in love in our time?

493
00:57:03,886 --> 00:57:07,760
Of course, especially in our time.

494
00:57:09,552 --> 00:57:11,843
What about Rilke's saying:

495
00:57:11,969 --> 00:57:16,135
"Modern life increasingly separates
men and women?"

496
00:57:16,219 --> 00:57:21,468
Rilke was a great poet,
he was probably right.

497
00:57:21,552 --> 00:57:23,135
Move back a bit!

498
00:57:23,219 --> 00:57:27,094
Typical Pathé-Journal!

499
00:57:29,053 --> 00:57:35,594
Do French and American women
differ in their romantic attitudes?

500
00:57:35,678 --> 00:57:39,344
French women
are totally unlike Americans.

501
00:57:39,428 --> 00:57:44,302
American women dominate men.
French women don't yet.

502
00:57:47,887 --> 00:57:51,052
What's your greatest ambition?

503
00:57:51,137 --> 00:57:55,512
Who are more moral:
Unfaithful women or deserting males?

504
00:57:55,596 --> 00:57:57,345
Unfaithful women.

505
00:57:57,429 --> 00:58:01,178
Are women more sentimental than men?

506
00:58:01,263 --> 00:58:06,012
Feelings are a luxury
few women can afford.

507
00:58:07,013 --> 00:58:12,887
Do you think there is a difference
between eroticism and love?

508
00:58:15,054 --> 00:58:17,720
No, not really.

509
00:58:17,804 --> 00:58:20,763
I don't think so, because...

510
00:58:20,847 --> 00:58:24,846
Eroticism is a form of love,
and vice versa.

511
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:28,804
Does the soul exist in modern society?

512
00:58:32,389 --> 00:58:37,513
Do women have a role to play
in modern society?

513
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:43,763
If she's charming and wears
a striped dress and dark glasses.

514
00:58:43,847 --> 00:58:48,930
Casanova said that there's no woman
who can't be seduced with gratitude.

515
00:58:49,015 --> 00:58:51,680
Cocteau will answer that.

516
00:58:51,765 --> 00:58:57,680
How many men can a woman love
in a lifetime? Physically, I mean.

517
00:59:02,806 --> 00:59:05,180
More than that!

518
00:59:05,265 --> 00:59:09,722
- Miss, you're in the shot.
- Two things matter in life.

519
00:59:09,806 --> 00:59:14,848
For men, it's women,
and for women, money.

520
00:59:14,932 --> 00:59:18,348
If you see a pretty girl
with a rich chap,

521
00:59:18,432 --> 00:59:22,015
you know she's nice
and he's a bastard.

522
00:59:25,849 --> 00:59:29,140
- Do you like Brahms?
- Like everyone, no.

523
00:59:29,224 --> 00:59:31,931
- And Chopin?
- A creep!

524
00:59:32,016 --> 00:59:34,848
What's your greatest ambition?

525
00:59:38,724 --> 00:59:43,057
To become immortal and then die.

526
01:00:25,393 --> 01:00:28,517
Are you Claudius Mansard?

527
01:00:28,601 --> 01:00:31,350
Yes, Mr Kovacs.

528
01:00:31,434 --> 01:00:36,184
I called this morning.
I was told you'd be here.

529
01:00:36,269 --> 01:00:40,101
- Tony sent me.
- Yes, Mr Kovacs.

530
01:00:40,185 --> 01:00:44,976
- Didn't we meet in Nice?
- No, Mr Kovacs.

531
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:50,101
- Did they call?
- They said it'd be an Oldsmobile.

532
01:00:50,185 --> 01:00:52,768
It fell through at the last minute.

533
01:00:52,852 --> 01:00:56,768
- And so?
- So, it's this.

534
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:12,144
- 800,000.
- OK.

535
01:01:13,395 --> 01:01:19,769
- I'll have the money next week.
- You bastard!

536
01:01:19,895 --> 01:01:24,060
And you, Mr Kovacs?
Who are you?

537
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:30,811
- So what?
- You don't get the money now.

538
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:34,353
Tough. Is it 3 o'clock yet?

539
01:01:34,437 --> 01:01:37,561
Can I use the phone?

540
01:01:53,272 --> 01:01:58,062
- Is Antonio there?
- He just left.

541
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:02,604
He said to meet him at the Escale at 4.

542
01:02:02,688 --> 01:02:04,896
OK, thanks.

543
01:02:08,105 --> 01:02:11,187
Don't bother. I carry my cash on me.

544
01:02:11,272 --> 01:02:16,021
- Lend me 10,000.
- No.

545
01:02:16,105 --> 01:02:18,562
5000?

546
01:02:18,647 --> 01:02:21,230
2500?

547
01:02:26,231 --> 01:02:29,355
She's not running?

548
01:02:30,856 --> 01:02:33,980
Hey, you!

549
01:02:34,064 --> 01:02:38,647
You remove the distributor cap?

550
01:02:39,814 --> 01:02:43,897
- You owe me a phone call!
- For a taxi!

551
01:02:44,898 --> 01:02:50,314
Step on it! Never mind
the pedestrians! Just hurry!

552
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:52,814
Step on it!

553
01:02:54,065 --> 01:03:00,606
The Thunderbird's left wing torn off!
Me, not a scratch!

554
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:07,314
That's where I was born.
Look at the eyesore they built opposite!

555
01:03:07,399 --> 01:03:11,814
Houses like that get me down.
They ruin the whole block.

556
01:03:11,899 --> 01:03:16,107
I have a feeling for beauty, Beauty.

557
01:03:17,608 --> 01:03:22,482
Go through Châtelet!
If we're late it's your fault.

558
01:03:22,566 --> 01:03:26,107
Overtake that Peugeot!

559
01:03:26,191 --> 01:03:31,732
Don't brake for a 4CV!
You're being overtaken by a scooter!

560
01:03:31,816 --> 01:03:34,732
Take the next left!

561
01:03:34,816 --> 01:03:38,399
- Wait. I'll be back.
- Yes, sir.

562
01:04:06,234 --> 01:04:08,442
He left 5 minutes ago.

563
01:04:08,527 --> 01:04:11,234
The friend who owes you money?

564
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:15,526
Antonio Berruti, yeah,
and it's your fault.

565
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:19,984
Now it's double or quits.
I'll tell you later.

566
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:22,151
Overtake that 2CV.

567
01:04:22,235 --> 01:04:26,817
- Where you going?
- To the New York Herald.

568
01:04:26,902 --> 01:04:31,776
- Why bother writing?
- To have money and not rely on men.

569
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:35,735
Paris girls look like tarts
in those short dresses.

570
01:04:35,819 --> 01:04:42,360
Makes me want to run up behind them
and do like this.

571
01:04:51,694 --> 01:04:56,277
- We'll be right back.
- Not paying the fare?

572
01:05:02,695 --> 01:05:07,069
- Where are we going?
- To the Champs Elysees, on foot.

573
01:05:07,154 --> 01:05:11,319
I hate taxi-drivers who are afraid
their car will get scratched.

574
01:05:11,404 --> 01:05:16,153
The Gestapo put up a wall here
so nobody could escape them.

575
01:05:16,237 --> 01:05:19,903
I've been thinking about that girl.

576
01:05:19,987 --> 01:05:26,028
The one with that chap on the Riviera.
You said you admired her.

577
01:05:26,112 --> 01:05:30,112
Yeah, an ordinary girl. That's rare.

578
01:05:32,655 --> 01:05:36,654
- Come with me to the paper?
- No, I've a call to make.

579
01:05:36,738 --> 01:05:41,820
I'm going to see my tailor.
I'll pick you up later.

580
01:06:00,864 --> 01:06:04,488
You're late. They're waiting.

581
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:35,406
- Miss Patricia Franchini?
- Over there.

582
01:06:53,866 --> 01:06:58,532
You speak French?
Do you know this man?

583
01:07:05,908 --> 01:07:07,990
No.

584
01:07:16,034 --> 01:07:20,408
Careful, little girl,
don't mess with the Paris police.

585
01:07:20,492 --> 01:07:23,533
- Yes, it's Michel.
- Poiccard?

586
01:07:23,617 --> 01:07:27,658
I didn't recognise him.
It's an old photo.

587
01:07:27,742 --> 01:07:33,241
You were seen with him this morning
just outside.

588
01:07:33,325 --> 01:07:39,824
He was driving
a Ford Thunderbird, 3382 GM 75.

589
01:07:39,909 --> 01:07:44,367
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

590
01:07:44,451 --> 01:07:48,325
Watch it,
watch what you say, little girl!

591
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:51,284
I've seen him five or six times.

592
01:07:51,368 --> 01:07:56,492
I found him nice. I don't know
where he lives or what he does.

593
01:07:56,576 --> 01:07:59,867
Known him long?

594
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:04,409
I met him 3 weeks ago in Nice.
I was on holiday.

595
01:08:04,493 --> 01:08:08,410
He came to Paris to see someone
who owes him money.

596
01:08:08,494 --> 01:08:12,535
- Who?
- I don't know. Some Italian.

597
01:08:14,786 --> 01:08:18,118
- Think you'll see him again?
- Maybe.

598
01:08:18,202 --> 01:08:23,160
Sometimes he calls me
and asks me out. Like this morning.

599
01:08:27,202 --> 01:08:30,076
- Got a work permit?
- Yes.

600
01:08:30,161 --> 01:08:33,868
You don't want any passport problems?

601
01:08:33,952 --> 01:08:38,119
So if you see him, here's my number.

602
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:43,494
Danton 01-00.

603
01:11:30,043 --> 01:11:34,583
President Eisenhower
is waving his arms.

604
01:11:39,418 --> 01:11:44,376
Was that what you meant
by double or quits?

605
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:48,209
- More or less.
- Let's go see a western.

606
01:11:48,294 --> 01:11:51,418
Yeah, better wait till dark.

607
01:12:03,627 --> 01:12:08,419
Beware, Jessica. On the kiss's
beveled edge time is a void

608
01:12:08,503 --> 01:12:12,710
Avoid, avoid memory's broken pledge.

609
01:12:15,128 --> 01:12:20,377
You're wrong. Your tale is noble
and tragic as the mask of a tyrant.

610
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:25,210
No drama so perilous or magnetic.
No detail can make our love pathetic.

611
01:12:34,795 --> 01:12:36,253
Hi, cutie!

612
01:12:51,337 --> 01:12:54,211
- What's it say?
- I'm reading it.

613
01:12:54,296 --> 01:12:59,628
The cops are stupid to be after me.
I'm one of the few who like them.

614
01:12:59,712 --> 01:13:03,462
Patricia, let me caress you.

615
01:13:05,088 --> 01:13:08,671
- Say something!
- Well!

616
01:13:08,755 --> 01:13:12,504
- So you're married.
- Show me.

617
01:13:15,047 --> 01:13:19,504
That was ages ago.
She was crazy. She dumped me.

618
01:13:19,588 --> 01:13:24,712
- Or I dumped her. I can't remember.
- I really like you, Michel.

619
01:13:24,797 --> 01:13:27,837
What's it like, to ride in a stolen car?

620
01:13:27,922 --> 01:13:30,588
- And killing a policeman?
- I was scared!

621
01:13:30,673 --> 01:13:37,588
- How did they know I knew you?
- Someone must've seen us together.

622
01:13:37,673 --> 01:13:41,797
That's very bad.
Grassing people up.

623
01:13:41,881 --> 01:13:47,213
No, it's normal. Grasses grass,
burglars burgle,

624
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:51,463
murderers murder, lovers love.

625
01:13:54,214 --> 01:13:57,214
Look, isn't the Concorde gorgeous!

626
01:13:58,882 --> 01:14:02,881
Yes, mysterious, with all the lights.

627
01:14:02,965 --> 01:14:06,923
I was a fool to keep this car.
Gotta switch.

628
01:14:07,007 --> 01:14:10,131
- What?
- Switch cars.

629
01:14:23,216 --> 01:14:27,632
- Let's steal the Cadillac.
- Sure.

630
01:14:27,716 --> 01:14:30,174
Cadillac Eldorado.

631
01:14:30,258 --> 01:14:34,924
You drive, I hide.
They leave the keys in the car here.

632
01:14:39,133 --> 01:14:43,049
- What do I tell the man?
- Say goodnight... in English.

633
01:14:43,133 --> 01:14:46,924
He won't say a thing.
The French are chickens.

634
01:14:47,008 --> 01:14:49,758
- "Chickens"?
- Scared stiff.

635
01:14:49,842 --> 01:14:54,008
- Are you scared?
- It's too late to be scared.

636
01:15:01,051 --> 01:15:02,633
Goodnight Madam.

637
01:15:02,717 --> 01:15:09,841
ARREST IMMINENT

638
01:15:19,843 --> 01:15:22,717
I really must find Antonio.

639
01:15:22,802 --> 01:15:27,551
Once you look for someone,
you never find him.

640
01:15:30,552 --> 01:15:33,092
Who was that?

641
01:15:33,177 --> 01:15:36,551
- Step on it, poppet.
- What's "poppet"?

642
01:15:56,219 --> 01:16:00,177
- Seen Antonio?
- I'll tell you if I can kiss her.

643
01:16:01,261 --> 01:16:04,093
It's not up to me,

644
01:16:04,178 --> 01:16:06,593
it's up to her.

645
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:12,761
He's with Zumbart in Montparnasse.

646
01:16:14,929 --> 01:16:17,011
Carl!

647
01:16:20,429 --> 01:16:24,053
- How's things?
- Antonio's not with you?

648
01:16:24,137 --> 01:16:26,719
There he is.

649
01:16:28,804 --> 01:16:31,636
- Who's that?
- Antonio?

650
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:36,262
Patricia Franchini, Carl Zumbart.

651
01:16:36,346 --> 01:16:41,054
Let's see those socks.
Silk socks with a tweed jacket!

652
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:45,595
- I like silk.
- Not with tweed!

653
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:50,012
- Hi, amigo.
- Hi, sonny.

654
01:16:50,138 --> 01:16:56,887
- You wanted to see me?
- I'm in shit, deep shit.

655
01:16:56,971 --> 01:17:00,637
Shit. Got a minute?
It's that man.

656
01:17:00,721 --> 01:17:05,721
- What do I say?
- Anything you want.

657
01:17:05,806 --> 01:17:10,638
- What will they do?
- Take photos of her kissing the man.

658
01:17:10,722 --> 01:17:13,846
Blackmail, probably.

659
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:35,639
- Right.
- I'll be right back.

660
01:17:35,723 --> 01:17:41,056
- Who's the chick?
- I'm in love with her.

661
01:18:01,141 --> 01:18:03,973
1.3 million, is OK.

662
01:18:04,058 --> 01:18:08,140
- What's your bank?
- The B.N.C.I.

663
01:18:10,974 --> 01:18:14,015
- What shall we do?
- I don't know.

664
01:18:14,099 --> 01:18:20,182
- Where can I reach you tomorrow?
- The hotels are crawling with tourists.

665
01:18:20,266 --> 01:18:26,391
- My friend in Montmartre has a big flat.
- Not Montmartre.

666
01:18:26,475 --> 01:18:31,141
- Why not?
- Too many enemies in Montmartre.

667
01:18:31,225 --> 01:18:36,349
- Try Zumbart's Swedish girl.
- Rue Campagne Première?

668
01:18:36,434 --> 01:18:40,599
- Call me there tomorrow.
- Bye, amigo.

669
01:18:55,935 --> 01:19:02,434
- Antonio said we could stay the night.
- Sit down. I'll be right with you.

670
01:19:07,351 --> 01:19:09,517
OK. Smile.

671
01:19:09,601 --> 01:19:12,350
Smile!

672
01:19:12,435 --> 01:19:17,851
- You could pose. It pays good.
- You have to sleep around.

673
01:19:17,936 --> 01:19:22,935
I was just thinking... I can't decide.

674
01:19:23,019 --> 01:19:24,893
Decide what?

675
01:19:24,977 --> 01:19:29,143
I don't know.
Otherwise I wouldn't hesitate.

676
01:19:35,061 --> 01:19:38,768
- You dumped your journalist?
- Yes.

677
01:19:38,894 --> 01:19:43,311
- Why did you say hello?
- To be sure I didn't love him anymore.

678
01:19:43,395 --> 01:19:46,227
You make life difficult.

679
01:19:46,312 --> 01:19:50,602
That's it.
Drop me on the Champs Elysees?

680
01:19:55,312 --> 01:19:57,394
Bye.

681
01:20:05,812 --> 01:20:10,728
- What record is it?
- Mozart's clarinet concerto.

682
01:20:10,813 --> 01:20:14,437
- Do you mind?
- No, I like that one.

683
01:20:14,521 --> 01:20:18,937
- I thought you didn't like music.
- This one's OK.

684
01:20:19,021 --> 01:20:25,728
My dad played clarinet.
He was brilliant on the clarinet.

685
01:20:25,813 --> 01:20:29,937
Want to turn in? Sleeping's so sad.

686
01:20:30,021 --> 01:20:35,645
- We're forced to apart.
- To be apart.

687
01:20:35,729 --> 01:20:39,896
They say "sleep together",
but it's not true.

688
01:20:51,689 --> 01:20:54,813
What is it?

689
01:20:57,605 --> 01:21:00,188
Nothing.

690
01:21:02,355 --> 01:21:05,230
Patricia, come here.

691
01:21:14,315 --> 01:21:18,480
Go buy the newspaper
and a bottle of milk.

692
01:21:24,981 --> 01:21:28,730
- What time is it?
- Five.

693
01:21:33,899 --> 01:21:36,065
Engaged all the time.

694
01:21:43,149 --> 01:21:47,773
- Michel... Nothing.
- The newspaper!

695
01:21:47,857 --> 01:21:50,648
I'm looking at you.

696
01:21:53,816 --> 01:21:57,691
It's your lucky day. Take a ticket.

697
01:21:57,775 --> 01:22:01,566
- A whisky.
- Don't have any.

698
01:22:05,650 --> 01:22:08,649
Danton 01-00?

699
01:22:10,108 --> 01:22:13,316
Inspector Vital, please.

700
01:22:18,692 --> 01:22:22,857
Hello? Patricia Franchini.

701
01:22:23,943 --> 01:22:28,692
I've just seen the man
you're looking for.

702
01:22:28,776 --> 01:22:33,692
He's at 11, rue Première Campagne.

703
01:22:33,776 --> 01:22:39,150
Yes. 11, rue Campagne Première.
Hello?

704
01:23:31,861 --> 01:23:34,610
- Thirsty?
- No.

705
01:23:34,695 --> 01:23:38,360
Antonio's on his way. He just called.

706
01:23:38,486 --> 01:23:42,110
We're on our way to Italy, baby!

707
01:23:43,486 --> 01:23:47,403
- I can't go.
- Sure you can, I'm taking you.

708
01:23:47,487 --> 01:23:53,028
Berruti's lending me his sports car.
An Amedeo Gordini model.

709
01:23:53,112 --> 01:23:56,445
Michel, I called the police.

710
01:23:56,529 --> 01:24:00,903
- I said you were here.
- Are you mad?

711
01:24:00,987 --> 01:24:04,111
No, I'm fine.

712
01:24:05,362 --> 01:24:10,571
No, I'm not.
I don't want to go with you.

713
01:24:10,655 --> 01:24:14,071
I knew it.

714
01:24:14,155 --> 01:24:19,321
I just talked about myself,
and you, yourself.

715
01:24:19,405 --> 01:24:23,321
You should've talked about me,
and me, about you.

716
01:24:23,405 --> 01:24:27,029
I don't want to be in love with you.

717
01:24:28,072 --> 01:24:31,946
That's why I called the police.

718
01:24:32,030 --> 01:24:37,488
I stayed with you
to see if I was in love with you.

719
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:41,197
Or if I wasn't in love with you.

720
01:24:42,698 --> 01:24:48,947
And since I'm being cruel to you,
it proves I'm not in love with you.

721
01:24:49,031 --> 01:24:51,197
Say that again!

722
01:24:51,281 --> 01:24:58,280
And since I'm being cruel to you,
it proves I'm not in love with you.

723
01:24:59,906 --> 01:25:02,947
They say there's no happy love.

724
01:25:03,031 --> 01:25:08,031
If I loved you... It's too complicated!

725
01:25:08,115 --> 01:25:12,864
On the contrary,
there's no unhappy love.

726
01:25:12,949 --> 01:25:18,198
- I want people to leave me alone.
- I'm independent.

727
01:25:18,282 --> 01:25:22,531
- Maybe you love me.
- You think you are. You're not.

728
01:25:22,615 --> 01:25:27,906
- That's why I gave you away.
- I'm better than you are.

729
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:32,615
Now you have no choice but to go.

730
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:35,907
You're out of your mind!

731
01:25:35,991 --> 01:25:39,782
That's a pathetic way to reason!

732
01:25:45,866 --> 01:25:49,949
You're like those women
who sleep with everyone,

733
01:25:50,033 --> 01:25:54,740
except the one man who loves them,

734
01:25:54,825 --> 01:25:58,991
saying it's because they sleep
with everyone.

735
01:26:00,576 --> 01:26:03,700
Why don't you go?

736
01:26:05,867 --> 01:26:10,325
I've slept with lots of boys.
Don't count on me.

737
01:26:11,576 --> 01:26:15,158
- Just go. Why wait?
- I'm staying.

738
01:26:15,242 --> 01:26:19,283
I'm in bad shape.
Anyway I want to go to jail.

739
01:26:19,367 --> 01:26:23,533
- You're mad!
- Yes.

740
01:26:25,410 --> 01:26:31,409
Nobody will talk to me.
I can look at the walls.

741
01:26:31,493 --> 01:26:34,492
Oh, shit! Berruti!

742
01:26:34,577 --> 01:26:37,701
Hey, amigo! I'll just park.

743
01:26:40,535 --> 01:26:45,117
Cops are coming.
The American girl grassed on me.

744
01:26:45,202 --> 01:26:50,785
- Get in! You fool! Get in!
- No, I'm staying.

745
01:26:53,494 --> 01:26:59,118
I've had enough. I'm tired.
I want to sleep.

746
01:26:59,203 --> 01:27:04,452
- You're crazy! Get in!
- Stuff the police. I'll save my neck.

747
01:27:04,536 --> 01:27:09,493
I shouldn't be thinking of her
but I can't help it.

748
01:27:09,578 --> 01:27:14,327
- Want my automatic?
- No.

749
01:27:14,411 --> 01:27:18,161
- Don't be stupid!
- Get out of here!

750
01:29:19,791 --> 01:29:22,915
I am a real creep.

751
01:29:34,917 --> 01:29:40,124
- What did he say?
- He said: "You're a real creep."

752
01:29:44,584 --> 01:29:47,541
What's a "creep"?
