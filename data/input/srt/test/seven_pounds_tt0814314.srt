<i> 911 emergency. </i>

I need an ambulance.

<i> I have you at 9212 West Third Street

Yes, room number two.

00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:26,062
<i>What's the emergency? </i>

6
00:01:28,651 --> 00:01:30,653
There's been a suicide.

7

<i> Who's the victim? </i>

8

16
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,418
Oh no, no thank you.

17
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:59,775
<i>What is your name again?
Ezra, is that right right? </i>

18
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,846
Yes, sir.

19
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,999
I'll just need your first and last name
So I can call up your account

20
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:06,423
You know what, here's what i'm thinking Ezra.

21
00:03:06,424 --> 00:03:09,282
I think i'm gonna mail
you the meat back personally

22
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:12,540
So you can see first hand the
type of dog food that you're peddling.

23
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:15,573
That won't be necessary, sir.

24
00:03:15,865 --> 00:03:20,256
- So how about we just start with your last name
- Thomas.

25
00:03:21,227 --> 00:03:23,171
And don't you get me started on
the pork
26
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,393
Have you tried the pork?

26
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:27,260
Well no, sir.I'm not much of
a meateater myself.

27
00:03:27,355 --> 00:03:30,492
But I hear really great things
about the pork.

28
00:03:30,557 --> 00:03:32,617
So you don't eat
pork at all?

29
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:33,722
No, sir.

30
00:03:33,723 --> 00:03:35,447
Are you jewish?

31
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,783
Is that why you don't
eat pork, Ezra?

32
00:03:39,745 --> 00:03:44,346
Well ...Can we start with
your first name, Mr Thomas?

33
00:03:46,027 --> 00:03:48,027
Ben.

34
00:03:49,552 --> 00:03:51,552
<i>No order for Ben Thomas. </i>

35
00:03:51,706 --> 00:03:53,750
Wow, hold on.
What was that voice?

36
00:03:54,236 --> 00:03:57,303
I don't have an order for
a Ben Thomas.

37
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:01,263
- Ezra. What was that voice?
- What voice?

38
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:03,853
- Are you blind?
- Excuse me?

39
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:05,746
You're kidding me.

40
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:10,004
A blind beef salesman
who doesn't eat meat.

41
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:15,705
<i> Now that, that is rich,
That is rich. </i>

42
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:17,779
Have you ever had sex, Ezra?

43
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:22,554
Did Lawrence in accounting put
you up to this?

44
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,855
<i> Because somehow I can't
imagine a blind- </i>

45
00:04:23,856 --> 00:04:27,861
<i> -vegan beef salesman
having sex. </i>

46
00:04:28,423 --> 00:04:31,734
- Listen, i'm trying to help you sir.
- You're trying to help me?

47
00:04:31,908 --> 00:04:34,622
The blind beef salesman
is trying to help me?

48
00:04:34,938 --> 00:04:37,445
I'm actually starting to feel
pretty bad for you, Ezra,

49
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:42,085
Because I look at my life and
it is surrounded by so much beauty,

50
00:04:42,196 --> 00:04:44,392
<i> and you can't see shit. </i>

51
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:49,509
Is that fair?
Does that seem fair to you, Ezra?

52
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,041
Do you even know what colour the ocean is?

53
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,602
<i> Do you!? </i>

54
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:56,269
It's blue, sir.

55
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,644
"It's blue, sir."
Say what you wanna say.

56

<i> React, say what you wanna say to me!

Hi, can I help you?

68
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:48,491
Yes. Hello.
I'm looking for Emily.

69
00:07:49,064 --> 00:07:51,970
- You're a friend of hers?
- Yes. Yes, ma'am.

70
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,768
- Cuz, she's not home.
- Godness ...

71
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:56,745
No she left this morning
she had to do some more tests.

72
00:07:57,306 --> 00:07:59,678
She asked me to watch Duke
until she got back.

73
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:02,616
Okay ...

74
00:08:02,636 --> 00:08:05,978
You've ever tried mixing banana
peel into the soil?

75
00:08:06,155 --> 00:08:08,227
- Really?
- It works, I swear.

76
00:08:09,628 --> 00:08:12,188
Would you by chance know where I can find her?

77
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:29,565
Cardiac wing?

78
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:31,944
Take the elevator to the fifth
floor, then turn left.

79
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,021
Thank you.

80
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,118
What's not I just saying.
It's absolutely impossible.

81
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,626
Hold the elevator!

82
00:08:47,384 --> 00:08:49,385
Thank you.

83
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:46,008
Can I help you?

84
00:09:46,797 --> 00:09:48,798
Yes, good evening.

85
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:52,373
I'm here to see Emily Posar.

86
00:09:52,823 --> 00:09:56,076
I'm sorry, visiting hours
are from 8am to 4pm.

87
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,291
You know it is really important
That I speak to her for just a moment.

88
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:04,189
You'll just have to come back
during visiting hours.

89
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,581
Thank you very much.

90
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,727
So if there's one thing that I have
learned and that you all should remember

91
00:11:07,787 --> 00:11:09,344
about winning these contracts.

92
00:11:09,345 --> 00:11:13,082
Three steps, first:
Tell them what you're gonna to Tell them.

93
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:15,220
Step two: You tell 'em.

94
00:11:15,392 --> 00:11:17,949
Step three:
Tell 'em what you told 'em.

95
00:11:19,906 --> 00:11:21,472
So we are gonna close by reminding them-

96
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:24,320
-that ol' girl here has
3% better specific impuls from-

97
00:11:24,382 --> 00:11:25,502
-C-level to vacuum-

98
00:11:25,503 --> 00:11:28,516
and if they pass on that, quite
frankly, they deserve another Sputnik.

99
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,780
<i></i>

100
00:11:34,932 --> 00:11:36,477
Now if you will excuse me-

101
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:39,932
-I have a very lovely very hungry
woman at home waiting for me

102
00:11:43,317 --> 00:11:45,317
Sarah!?

103
00:11:47,846 --> 00:11:49,847
Honey!?

104
00:11:52,027 --> 00:11:55,104
Everyone at work kept saying
it was daylight savings time.

105
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,508
- You were supposed to be here a while ago.
- I kept saying it wasn't.

106
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,833
This happens all the time
and it's always work.

107
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:02,925
- I'm sorry.
- Well I'm angry with you.

108
00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:06,107
I'm gonna be angry with you all night long.
In fact ... What are you doing?

109
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:08,885
I'm angry with you, okay?
How about i'm angry with you?

110
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,153
Hello.

111
00:12:23,154 --> 00:12:25,197
Hey it's me, it's your brother.

112
00:12:25,822 --> 00:12:27,824
<i> Where are you? </i>

113
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:31,198

00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,386
<i> Are you okay? </i>

115
00:12:35,277 --> 00:12:37,278
Of course.

116
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:39,807
<i> Listen, Why did you disconnect the landline? </i>

117
00:12:42,504 --> 00:12:44,505
The phone broke.

118
00:12:45,357 --> 00:12:47,359
<i> I don't need it anymore. </i>

119
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,022
Did I do something?

120
00:12:52,663 --> 00:12:56,656
No, nuh-oh. Unless you're smoking again.

121
00:12:57,283 --> 00:13:01,484
No, I put on 20 pounds.
I'm in the best shape of my life.

122
00:13:02,924 --> 00:13:07,001
<i> Are you eating? Are you taking care
of yourself? Cuz', well you sound terrible again. </i>

123
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:09,087
Yeah I'm fine.
Look, I gotta go.

124
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,789
Give Melanie and the kids,
a hug and a kiss.

125
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,630
I'll talk to you later.
You take care of yourself.

126
00:13:15,692 --> 00:13:18,247
Wo hold on, listen.
I know it's been a while ...

127
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:23,601
But when you we're staying here, You didn't
take something of mine by mistake, did you?

128
00:13:25,007 --> 00:13:27,008
I remember giving you something.

129
00:13:29,456 --> 00:13:32,832
Do you remember that ?
Because I remember that very clearly.

130
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:36,608
Yeah.

131
00:13:39,227 --> 00:13:41,227
Just remember I love you.

132
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:20,920
Hi, my name is Ben Thomas.

134
00:14:25,337 --> 00:14:27,700
Inez! I'm speaking to you.

135
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:33,690
I understand you refused to take your
meds again this afternoon, is that true?

136
00:14:34,178 --> 00:14:36,179
No, no.

137
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:41,357
Let's try using your words
this time, okay Inez?

138
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,729
I mean this silent treatment
isn't doing anybody any good.

139
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,821
Inez, how can we help you if you...

140
00:14:47,942 --> 00:14:52,562
Okay, how about I come back tomorrow
and see if you've changed your mind, okay?.

141
00:14:54,112 --> 00:14:56,112
That a girl.

142
00:14:58,212 --> 00:15:01,069
I thought I was coming to your office today.

143
00:15:01,305 --> 00:15:04,894
Yes, I was in the neighbourhood and
thought i'd stop by, save you the drive.

144
00:15:05,222 --> 00:15:07,318
Terrific.
Let's go talk in my office.

145
00:15:07,566 --> 00:15:08,940
Come on.

146
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,542
I take a non nonesense approach

147
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:14,905
I cut the operating cost of this
place over 17% last year, alone.
149
00:15:14,178 --> 00:15:16,178
I am sure that made them happy.

148
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,140
Hell yeah!

149
00:15:20,273 --> 00:15:23,710
Now if I can only get my own,
personal finances in that kinda shape ...

150
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:26,219
I wouldn't have you sitting here, no offense

151
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,095
That you're new beemer out front?
(BMW)
154
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,370
Ben, I mean ...

152
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:40,052
When I found out that my bone marrow transplant
wasn't succesfull ...

153
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:42,219
I'm well aware of your ongoing medical condition.

154
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:46,080
Things aren't looking very promising for me
158
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:50,317
Look.

155
00:15:51,913 --> 00:15:54,006
I have a bonus coming in january.

156
00:15:54,275 --> 00:15:57,538
I just really need this six months extension.

157
00:15:58,454 --> 00:16:02,205
Really I mean,I'm doing the
very best I can here, I promise you.

158
00:16:13,175 --> 00:16:16,581
I'm gonna show myself out.
I'll be in touch.

159
00:16:17,253 --> 00:16:21,167
Well, thank you I appreciate it.
I mean, this way everybody wins, right?

160
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:36,391
Hello.

161
00:16:43,121 --> 00:16:45,122
My name is Ben.

162
00:16:47,026 --> 00:16:50,273
I totally understand if you don't
wanna speak to me either-

163
00:16:50,988 --> 00:16:54,420
-but I would really like to just
have a moment of your time.

164
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:18,755
I'm trying to figure out
What kind of man Stewart Goodman is.

165
00:17:22,394 --> 00:17:27,569
It is whitin my power
to drasticly change his circumstances.

166
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:33,283
But I don't wanna give that man a gift
that he doesn't deserve.

167
00:17:36,712 --> 00:17:40,536
I need you to tell me,
wether or nothe is a good person.

168
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:14,992
"The drug he gives me, makes me dizzy."

169
00:18:19,215 --> 00:18:21,215
"I want a new one."

170
00:18:21,662 --> 00:18:26,175
That sounds very reasonable Inez.
What else?

171
00:18:29,968 --> 00:18:31,968
You can trust me.

172
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:37,430
What else, Inez?

173
00:18:53,568 --> 00:18:57,519
He's punishing you?
How is he punishing you?

174
00:19:02,994 --> 00:19:04,995
How is he punishing you, Inez?

175
00:19:29,223 --> 00:19:30,653
Ben?

176
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:32,712
Ben, where are you going?

177
00:19:32,823 --> 00:19:34,825
- Where's the washroom?
- To the right.

178
00:19:34,962 --> 00:19:36,470
Is there a problem?

179
00:19:36,471 --> 00:19:39,423
- Give her a bath. Right now!
- Absolutely

180
00:19:39,515 --> 00:19:41,690
Thank you. Thank you ...

181
00:19:44,628 --> 00:19:46,375
Ben, I think you have the wrong
impression here.

182
00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:48,231
I'm gonna stop by
from time to time

183
00:19:48,232 --> 00:19:50,623
to make sure you're
showing these people some goddam respect.

184
00:19:50,778 --> 00:19:54,540
- This is a misunderstanding, Okay?
- You don't treat people like that.

185
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:58,875
- Let me explain okay, Ben.
- And i'm not giving you an extension.

186
00:19:58,968 --> 00:19:59,837
Ben!

187
00:19:59,838 --> 00:20:01,518
I'm not giving you anything you anything!

188
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:06,437
I almost believed you, you son of a bitch.
I almost believed!

189
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:27,007
Hey!

190
00:20:27,464 --> 00:20:29,466
Hey, Michelle.

191
00:20:30,754 --> 00:20:33,137
- Good to see you.
- You too.

192
00:20:34,104 --> 00:20:35,899
- How are you?
- I'm good.

193
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,901
- Hey, man.
- What are you doing here?

194
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:42,004
I'm just coming to make sure that she
is still kicking your ass, at everything.

195
00:20:42,315 --> 00:20:44,316
And I am.

196
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,965
- Can we have a sec hon?
- Yeah.

197
00:20:49,576 --> 00:20:53,042
- Are you okay?
- Yeah I'm good.
You said you were gonna call me.

198
00:20:53,615 --> 00:20:56,783
On the 15th.
Today is the 19th.

199
00:20:56,894 --> 00:21:00,174
I know, the doctor didn't have the results.
So, I had no information to give you.

200
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,593
Still you should call me.

201
00:21:02,856 --> 00:21:04,359
- Right?
- Yes, I know.

202
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:06,359
- We are still friends, right?
- Yeah.

203
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,925
I'm just. I'm doing some
soul-searching you know?

204
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:15,389
Don't do that.

205
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:17,665
- We have a plan.
- I know.

206
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,666
- Do what you promised me.
- I will.

207
00:21:20,058 --> 00:21:22,443
Do you know they rent clubs
up at the clubhouse.

208
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:26,614
I'm well aware of that.
I think I'm gonna keep my ass un-kicked today.

209
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,652
Were you looking at him,
or where you looking at me?

210
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:51,926
Acctually I was just sitting here.

211
00:22:52,812 --> 00:22:54,813
Am I doing it wrong?

212
00:22:55,643 --> 00:22:59,869
- I think I saw you in the elevator the other day?
- Oh Yes ...

213
00:23:03,106 --> 00:23:06,143
Acctually, you are being auditted.

214
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:10,535
My name is Ben Thomas.
I'm with the IRS.

215
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:16,692
And you owe the gouvernment
$56.240 and 19 cent.

216
00:23:17,413 --> 00:23:20,784
- I know.
- And now, you get me.

217
00:23:22,827 --> 00:23:24,829
Would you have a seat, please.
Miss Posar?

218
00:23:26,275 --> 00:23:32,278
So, I've been looking over the
income statement from last three years.

219
00:23:33,858 --> 00:23:35,952
- 2005, 200 ...
- Were you ...

220
00:23:36,743 --> 00:23:39,198
Were you in my room the other night?

221
00:23:41,008 --> 00:23:44,915
No, ma'am.
I was not in your room the other night.

222
00:23:46,148 --> 00:23:50,000
That's not exactly IRS protocol.

223
00:23:50,836 --> 00:23:53,661
So I've been looking over
05, 06 and 07-

224
00:23:53,753 --> 00:23:57,783
-and there seems to be quite a disparity
between what you claimed and. ..

225
00:23:57,832 --> 00:23:59,834
Mr Thomas.

226
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,245
I just got discharged.

227
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:08,164
So, you know unless you're gonna
call me off to some IRS jail or something-

228
00:24:08,263 --> 00:24:11,478
-I'd really like to get home now.

229
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:14,825
Sure. No problem.

230
00:24:17,268 --> 00:24:19,269
I'll be in touch.

231
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,589
Welcome to the Travel Inn.
Can I help you?

232
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:05,679
- I need a room.
- How many hours?

233
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,408
About two weeks.

234
00:25:36,215 --> 00:25:40,727
<i></i>

235
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:50,810
Alright alright, thats it!

236
00:25:56,158 --> 00:25:58,160
Rico!

237
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:01,670
Rico, knock it off!

238
00:26:02,164 --> 00:26:04,164
Somebody wanna remind Rico where we are?

239
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,467
In the sanctuary, Coach!

240
00:26:06,468 --> 00:26:09,558
- I can't hear you.
- The sanctuary, coach!

241
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:11,905
That's right Rico, in the sanctuary.

242
00:26:12,006 --> 00:26:14,238
Now give me 20 stops and starts.

243
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:17,625
<i> Hi, this is Emily Posa. </i>

244
00:26:17,626 --> 00:26:23,493
<i> I'm not home right now, but please leave a
message and I'll call you back as soon as possible. </i>

245
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:24,700
<i> Thank you. </i>

246
00:26:24,701 --> 00:26:26,261
<i> Hi, my name is Susan Noah. </i>

247
00:26:26,261 --> 00:26:29,947
<i> I'm calling cuz' a friend of mine told me
to do letter presentations and I was wondering ...</i>

248
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,121
Hello. Hi this is Emily.

249
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:42,300
Yeah I do wedding invatations. I'm not able
to take any requests though, right now.

250
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,388
I know someone nearby who does it
.

251
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:49,371
she's not as good as I am, but ah.

252
00:26:51,924 --> 00:26:53,926
Hello?

253
00:27:00,554 --> 00:27:02,556
Duke!?

254
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,880
Duke!?

255
00:27:07,881 --> 00:27:09,881
We're out here!

256
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,193
- Hello, Miss Posa.
- What are you doing here?

257
00:27:20,823 --> 00:27:23,951
- I came to see you.
- Don't you people ever call ahead?

258
00:27:24,607 --> 00:27:28,246
You people, descend to try to hide things.

259
00:27:28,325 --> 00:27:31,837
Is that meat? No! No, no!

260
00:27:31,992 --> 00:27:34,305
No meat! No!

261
00:27:34,894 --> 00:27:38,535
- He was really enjoying it.
- He eats steamed broccoli and Tofu.

262
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,872
- Why?
- He's a vegetarian.

263
00:27:42,404 --> 00:27:44,654
- He is a vegetarian?
- Yes.

264
00:27:45,548 --> 00:27:47,549
Well that sucks.

265
00:27:48,296 --> 00:27:50,641
Can we talk? Do you have a moment?

266
00:27:52,072 --> 00:27:55,528
No. Acctually I have to take Duke for a walk.

267
00:27:56,725 --> 00:28:00,189
No problem.
I'll go with you, if you don't mind.

268
00:28:06,516 --> 00:28:12,275
So I've been looking over
2005, 2006 and 2007 ...

269
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,080
(Sigh)
I'm listening.

270
00:28:15,972 --> 00:28:18,962
- Can I get him for you?
- No. I got him.

271
00:28:20,683 --> 00:28:24,649
- Let me get him, are you alright?
- Yes.

272
00:28:24,757 --> 00:28:26,759
Sorry.

273
00:28:27,349 --> 00:28:29,222
Watch.

274
00:28:29,223 --> 00:28:31,425
Heel!

275
00:28:33,489 --> 00:28:35,489
Maybe we shouldn't feed him meat.

276
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:38,479
So I've been looking over ...

277
00:28:40,901 --> 00:28:43,039
- Maybe we can do this later.
- Yeah.

278
00:28:47,487 --> 00:28:49,686
So you cook it all ahead a time I see.

279
00:28:50,345 --> 00:28:52,868
No. Acctually I can't
remember the last time I cooked.

280
00:28:54,008 --> 00:28:57,403
This is my sisters way of
looking out for me from afar.

281
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:05,172
- Do you have any siblings?
- Yes, one brother. He's a good egg.

282
00:29:06,321 --> 00:29:08,321
Yeah, I just have the one sister too.

283
00:29:10,158 --> 00:29:15,049
Have you receiving income from any source
that the government is currently un-aware of?

284
00:29:15,688 --> 00:29:19,512
Lately, i've been taking to
diving in local wishing wells so ...

285
00:29:20,023 --> 00:29:25,017
I mean, it's just occasional
dimes here and there ...

286
00:29:25,068 --> 00:29:27,550
Or once in a while a quarter ...

287
00:29:27,637 --> 00:29:30,058
No acctually I am, I had
to re-finance this place

288
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,060
to pay my past two medical bills

289
00:29:33,302 --> 00:29:38,033
I've been informed that you
suffer from congenital heart failure.

290
00:29:38,564 --> 00:29:42,733
Yes. Did you gather that,
while stalking me at the hospital?

291
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,421
No ...

292
00:29:46,812 --> 00:29:49,574
You're currently status 2.

293
00:29:49,808 --> 00:29:51,576
Which means you are sick enough-

294
00:29:51,577 --> 00:29:53,430
-to be on a national UNO's waiting list-

295
00:29:53,431 --> 00:29:57,923
but not sick enough to be admitted
into the hospital and placed on a status one.

296
00:29:58,335 --> 00:30:02,996
So, basically, if your heart starts to
fail quickly and no donor can be located,

297
00:30:04,562 --> 00:30:06,564
you're screwed.

298
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,470
Is it true that you said,

299
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:17,915
that you do not believe that you even deserve
a heart because your life is unremarkable

300
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,212
in every way.

301
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:27,460
I'm sorry.

302
00:30:33,554 --> 00:30:37,385
I don't know why I said that.
I'm Sorry.

303
00:30:37,811 --> 00:30:42,694
Do you have to take any type of sensitivity
training to join the IRS, Mr Thomas?

304
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,522
- No. Not really.
- Yeah.

305
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,512
So you don't consider yourself a good person?

306
00:30:51,994 --> 00:30:55,054
How would you answer that question
If I asked you the same?

307
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,609
Unremarkable would be ...

308
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:06,419
... an upgrade for me,
I assure you.

309
00:31:11,134 --> 00:31:15,863
I'm Gonna freeze your accountas uncollectable
until further notice.

310
00:31:16,987 --> 00:31:20,404
I'm sure that'll buy you,
five or six months penalty free.

311
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:28,155
Here's my card.

312
00:31:28,156 --> 00:31:33,570
If anyone at the IRS tries to contact you
you call me immediately.

313
00:31:34,177 --> 00:31:36,178
Okay.

314
00:31:36,739 --> 00:31:38,740
Thank you.

315
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:41,191
Thank you.

316
00:31:43,223 --> 00:31:45,224
Okay.

317
00:31:48,653 --> 00:31:50,653
- Mr. Thomas!
- Yes?

318
00:32:02,273 --> 00:32:06,737
Why do I get the feeling you're
doing me a really big favor right now?

319
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:13,542
Because I get the feeling
that you really deserve it.

320
00:32:17,538 --> 00:32:19,539
Allright?

321
00:32:24,686 --> 00:32:27,687
Uhm, you off to uh ...

322
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:30,869
You off to pollute
somebody elses dog now?

323
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:35,169
No.

324
00:32:37,005 --> 00:32:40,157
- Just going home.
- Where's that?

325
00:32:50,874 --> 00:32:54,874
- Take care, Emily.
- You too.

326
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:32,519
- What is this thing for?
- Told you already.

327
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:37,273
- Why are you bringing a fish into your room?
- Because it's my room.

328
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:41,391
And I don't want anyone to go
into my room, understood?

329
00:34:41,995 --> 00:34:44,353
I don't think you can
keep a fish in you room.

330
00:34:44,804 --> 00:34:46,805
I think I can.

331
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:49,897
I have never had anybody
who kept a fish in their room.

332
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,540
Now you do.

333
00:34:53,603 --> 00:34:55,564
Good night.

334
00:35:12,115 --> 00:35:14,819
<i> The first time
I ever saw a box jellyfish, </i>

335
00:35:17,564 --> 00:35:19,566
<i> I was twelve. </i>

336
00:35:24,886 --> 00:35:28,654
<i> My father took us
to the Monterey Bay aquarium. </i>

337
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:38,466
<i> I never forgot when he said that
it was the most deadly creature on earth. </i>

338
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,851
<i> To me it was just ...</i>

339
00:35:46,867 --> 00:35:48,916
<i> ... the most beautiful
thing I had ever seen. </i>

340
00:35:58,443 --> 00:36:02,241
I spoke to the doctor again
He'd send over your files in the morning.

341
00:36:04,844 --> 00:36:07,321
- Is this everything?
- Yes.

342
00:36:09,307 --> 00:36:11,309
- Any questions?
- Same one.

343
00:36:12,282 --> 00:36:14,159
Same answer then.

344
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:16,045
You know, I was thinking last night

345
00:36:16,046 --> 00:36:19,370
About when we were fourteen
and we made our Big Pact.

346
00:36:20,448 --> 00:36:22,603
You remember on the beach,
in front your grandparents house,

347
00:36:22,694 --> 00:36:28,686
We agreed that we would never
never date eachothers girls.

348
00:36:30,594 --> 00:36:32,065
And I remembered that that night-

349
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:34,228
you told me how much
you liked Stacy Miller-

350
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,786
-and that you were gonna ask her out.

351
00:36:36,787 --> 00:36:42,768
And I said wow, hey man,
you can't her and I already did it.

352
00:36:42,907 --> 00:36:45,079
which we didn't but I wanted to ...

353
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:48,057
But she, liked you way more than she liked me

354
00:36:49,633 --> 00:36:51,756
So I lied to you because I was so jelous.

355
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:58,380
And I've been carrying around
this lie in my heart for the last 25 ...

356
00:36:59,382 --> 00:37:01,383
Stop it !

357
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:04,039
Stop it!

358
00:37:04,799 --> 00:37:06,800
Stay focused.

359
00:37:08,716 --> 00:37:11,796
- Do what you promised me.
- What, you think I'm ...

360
00:37:11,901 --> 00:37:13,901
Do what you promised me.

361
00:37:16,864 --> 00:37:19,141
You think i'm gonna let you down now,
aren't you?

362
00:37:20,267 --> 00:37:22,421
I've known you my whole damn life!

363
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,603
Okay?

364
00:37:24,604 --> 00:37:29,132
This,this! This is nott something
you do everyday, okay?

365
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,878
This is not easy for me!

366
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:36,220
I will make sure everything goes as planned.

367
00:37:43,756 --> 00:37:45,757
Don't worry.

368
00:37:48,595 --> 00:37:50,595
Thank you.

369
00:38:16,304 --> 00:38:18,471
My God.

370
00:38:19,911 --> 00:38:22,935
- Hello, Holly.
- Look at you!

371
00:38:27,244 --> 00:38:30,148
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see you.

372
00:38:30,554 --> 00:38:32,554
- Really?
- You have a minute?

373
00:38:32,694 --> 00:38:36,629
Sure. Come on in.
Come to my office.

374
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,483
Have a seat.

375
00:38:50,471 --> 00:38:52,628
- You look great.
- I do?

376
00:38:53,512 --> 00:38:55,513
I feel great.

377
00:38:55,789 --> 00:38:58,464
- How are you?
- I'm really good.

378
00:39:00,185 --> 00:39:04,868
- I need a favor.
- Whatever you need, just ask me.

379
00:39:06,382 --> 00:39:08,054
I need a name.

380
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:12,069
Someone in the system, someone
having a really hard time,

381
00:39:12,578 --> 00:39:16,031
and needs help,but maybe
too proud to ask for a handout.

382
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:25,128
- What are you doing?
- I'm Helping.

383
00:39:29,608 --> 00:39:35,397
- I need a name.
- Okay.

384
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,231
<i> Connie Tapos. </i>

385
00:39:40,662 --> 00:39:44,127
<i> her boyfriend almost killed her last year
when she tried to leave. </i>

386
00:39:45,937 --> 00:39:48,593
<i> he broke three of her ribs last month. </i>

387
00:39:50,163 --> 00:39:52,054
<i> She's scared to death to press charges- </i>

388
00:39:52,054 --> 00:39:54,055
<i> -and we can't do anything. </i>

389
00:40:06,706 --> 00:40:08,316
- Hello!
- Hi.

390
00:40:08,317 --> 00:40:10,814
- Connie Tapos?
- Yes.

391
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,621
My name is Ben Thomas.
I'm with the IRS.

392
00:40:14,449 --> 00:40:16,449
IRS?
But I always pay my taxes.

393
00:40:16,584 --> 00:40:20,040
Yes, this is more of a general inquiry.

394
00:40:20,597 --> 00:40:22,283
I don't understand ...

395
00:40:46,501 --> 00:40:48,501
- Beautiful
- Gracias

396
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:24,401
What are you talking about?

397
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,351
You know what I'm talking about.

398
00:41:30,133 --> 00:41:32,187
No, I have no idea what you are talking about

399
00:41:53,675 --> 00:41:56,662
You say you were from the IRS
but you are lying to me.

400
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,875
- No.
- You're not telling me the truth.
Who sent you here?

401
00:42:06,137 --> 00:42:10,218
You're coming to my house and talking to
me about "Mi caso y mi boyfriend?"

402
00:42:36,161 --> 00:42:37,100
- Your children are in danger here.

403
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:42,888
You don't have to live like this,
I can help you

404
00:42:42,976 --> 00:42:45,477
You don't know me. Get out of my
house now or I'm gonna call the police.

405
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:47,334
- Okay, okay ...
- Who are you?

406
00:42:47,335 --> 00:42:49,829
- I want you to take my card.
- I don't need your help.

407
00:42:49,923 --> 00:42:53,145
- You can call me anytime.
I'm gonna leave it right here.
- I don't need it.

408
00:42:55,368 --> 00:42:58,371
- You're not helpless.
- Can you just leave my house, this is my house.

409
00:42:58,495 --> 00:42:59,086
- Get out of my house now

410
00:43:23,497 --> 00:43:24,757
I can't talk right now.

411
00:43:24,758 --> 00:43:26,648
<i> No! I need to talk with you immediately.
Where are you? </i>

412
00:43:26,649 --> 00:43:29,246
- I'm nowhere.
- Listen' I'm gonna meet you at the house okay?

413
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,847
No, not at the house.
I'm traveling.

414
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:35,623
- I'll talk to you next week.
- No, we need to discuss  this right now!

415
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,852
- How are you doing you two?
- I'm good.

416
00:44:39,735 --> 00:44:43,114
- What a big day.
- Yes. No more dialysis, George.

417
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:45,241
- See you in the OR.
- Yes.

418
00:44:46,754 --> 00:44:48,091
I'll see you there aswell.

419
00:44:48,091 --> 00:44:50,092
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

420
00:44:51,908 --> 00:44:53,910
So I've heard you've raised enough-

421
00:44:53,931 --> 00:44:56,742
money to give a couple of the
kids partial scholarship to college.

422
00:44:56,849 --> 00:44:58,458
Eh, it's no big deal.

423
00:44:58,459 --> 00:45:02,777
I just convinced a couple of big wigged donors
that what the world really  needs to see is

424
00:45:03,047 --> 00:45:05,715
More latinos on ice

425
00:45:09,303 --> 00:45:12,083
You know, Ben,
I keep asking you this,

426
00:45:12,923 --> 00:45:15,141
but why me?

427
00:45:17,936 --> 00:45:24,857
- Because you, are a good man.
- No, really.

428
00:45:25,959 --> 00:45:29,421
Even when you don't know
that people are watching you.

429
00:45:42,123 --> 00:45:44,124
<i> Hello. </i>

430
00:45:44,744 --> 00:45:46,745
Hello.

431
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,762
Hello!?

432
00:45:51,693 --> 00:45:55,451
<i> Uhm, okay I can't hear you
so try back again. </i>

433
00:45:56,683 --> 00:46:00,102
I'm gonna hang up now. Bye!

434
00:46:13,393 --> 00:46:15,134
Mr Thomas?

435
00:46:15,134 --> 00:46:17,135
We're ready for you.

436
00:47:45,118 --> 00:47:46,938
These are beautiful!

437
00:47:46,939 --> 00:47:49,767
Oh, Banana peels. who knew?

438
00:48:18,004 --> 00:48:19,956
Emily?

439
00:49:55,785 --> 00:49:57,786
Can I get you a refill?

440
00:49:59,645 --> 00:50:02,302
- Susan?
- Yes.

441
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:07,181
- How is Ryan?
- He's good. He's with his dad this weekend.

442
00:50:07,896 --> 00:50:13,273
Will you tell him for me that
I'm ready whenever he is for free lesson.

443
00:50:14,156 --> 00:50:19,917
Yeah, alright. Things are kinda crasy
right now in school but, maybe when schools up.

444
00:50:20,321 --> 00:50:22,323
That's perfect.

445
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:50,640
How's the pie?

446
00:50:51,279 --> 00:50:53,383
It's good.

447
00:50:54,085 --> 00:50:57,994
You're gonna ask her out?
The waitress.

448
00:51:01,438 --> 00:51:03,528
No.

449
00:51:04,189 --> 00:51:06,043
You never know.

450
00:51:06,043 --> 00:51:10,418
I don't think she sees me.

451
00:51:14,232 --> 00:51:15,553
Good night, Ezra.

452
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:55,334
Hello?

453
00:51:56,509 --> 00:51:58,510
Ben?

454
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:01,158
Hi, sorry I call so late.

455
00:52:02,921 --> 00:52:07,323
Did anyone from the IRS contact you?

456
00:52:08,055 --> 00:52:10,831
No. I just ...

457
00:52:12,874 --> 00:52:15,700
I was having trouble breething
After I took Duke for a walk.

458
00:52:16,104 --> 00:52:17,718
And I fainted.

459
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:19,840
<i> An ambulance had to take me to the hospital. </i>

460
00:52:22,788 --> 00:52:25,504
I'm so sorry. I don't know
why I even called you, I'm sorry.

461
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:28,516
It's just that I have your card with me ...

462
00:52:33,746 --> 00:52:35,748
Ben.

463
00:52:38,364 --> 00:52:41,224
- You still there?
- Yes.

464
00:52:45,859 --> 00:52:47,859
Do you ever think about dying, Ben?

465
00:52:50,339 --> 00:52:52,341
Every now and again.

466
00:52:54,099 --> 00:52:59,346
My face is, blueish.
It's not exactly a good sign.

467
00:53:00,454 --> 00:53:05,088
You should try to rest.
Just see if you can get some sleep.

468
00:53:06,647 --> 00:53:08,648
I like talking to you.

469
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:11,171
<i> I like, talking to you too. </i>

470
00:53:14,648 --> 00:53:17,001
Would you tell me a story, please?

471
00:53:21,258 --> 00:53:23,260
Okay.

472
00:53:25,803 --> 00:53:28,489
Once upon a time,

473
00:53:29,052 --> 00:53:32,798
<i> There was a little boy named ...</i>

474
00:53:33,049 --> 00:53:35,932
How lucky me, just got
it on reserve like that, okay-

475
00:53:38,444 --> 00:53:40,450
Let me guess.
His name was Ben.

476
00:53:42,946 --> 00:53:48,441
- No, actually, this little boys name is Tim.
- I like the name Tim.

477
00:53:49,614 --> 00:53:51,616
Go on.

478
00:53:51,844 --> 00:53:54,403
<i> Tims little brother was always
pestering Tim </i>

479
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:58,648
To make him paper airplanes,
because he was really good at it.

480
00:53:59,989 --> 00:54:02,951
But, Tim had much bigger dreams than that.

481
00:54:03,637 --> 00:54:05,918
Okay. Then what happened?

482
00:54:07,104 --> 00:54:13,106
One day, Tim went out to the backyard and
he put leaves and taped branches to his arms

483
00:54:14,662 --> 00:54:16,663
and started climbing their big oak tree.

484
00:54:16,685 --> 00:54:19,307
<i>His little brother said,
"Tim, you can't fly!" </i>

485
00:54:20,903 --> 00:54:22,903
<i> And he said, "Ye you just watch." </i>

486
00:54:23,169 --> 00:54:25,171
He got all the way to the top ...

487
00:54:26,043 --> 00:54:28,045
... and jumped.

488
00:54:29,146 --> 00:54:31,208
How tall was this tree?

489
00:54:31,931 --> 00:54:35,218
<i> It was pretty tall.
He broke his arm. </i>

490
00:54:35,752 --> 00:54:38,218
Oh my god, this is a horrible story.

491
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,311
No, no!
It gets better.

492
00:54:40,312 --> 00:54:45,349
From that experience,
Tim realized that he wanted to fly.

493
00:54:46,542 --> 00:54:49,893
So he dedicated his life to making space ships.

494
00:54:50,359 --> 00:54:52,954
I thought you said this was a good story.

495
00:54:53,654 --> 00:54:57,742
Oh well, that is ...

496
00:55:00,286 --> 00:55:02,898
... until the dragons showed up .

497
00:55:03,455 --> 00:55:08,311
Okay, I see. Now it's getting better.
I like dragons.

498
00:55:08,403 --> 00:55:10,404
Especially dragons in space.

499
00:55:11,757 --> 00:55:17,452
Yes, and these were fire breething
space dragons with really bad attitudes

500
00:55:18,905 --> 00:55:20,906
I see ...

501
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,460
I have an idea.

502
00:55:24,461 --> 00:55:29,458
<i> Why don't you try to fall asleep,
and when you do. I'll just hang up. </i>

503
00:55:32,742 --> 00:55:38,745
- Okay. Ben ...
- Yes.

504
00:55:41,307 --> 00:55:45,504
Thank you for listening ...
and for talking.

505
00:55:48,362 --> 00:55:50,362
<i> Try to fall asleep. </i>

506
00:55:55,803 --> 00:55:57,805
Good night, Ben.

507
00:55:58,675 --> 00:56:00,676
Good night, Emily.

508
00:56:06,854 --> 00:56:08,855
Emily ...

509
00:56:15,563 --> 00:56:17,565
Emily?

510
00:57:10,207 --> 00:57:12,009
I lied to you.

511
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:16,187
I think about dying every day.

512
00:57:26,129 --> 00:57:30,515
<i> Dr. Khane to NICU Dr. Wesley Khane to NICU </i>

513
00:58:20,056 --> 00:58:21,758
Hey.

514
00:58:23,943 --> 00:58:25,943
When did you get here?

515
00:58:28,452 --> 00:58:30,452
Last night, after we talked.

516
00:58:32,364 --> 00:58:34,364
You slept here?

517
00:58:36,161 --> 00:58:38,516
Good morning.
How is our patient?

518
00:58:38,864 --> 00:58:40,984
- Morning. Better.
- Good.

519
00:58:41,128 --> 00:58:43,836
- Hello.
- Hi. Ben, Is that right? IRS?

520
00:58:43,948 --> 00:58:45,946
- Yes, how are you?
- Good thank you.

521
00:58:45,947 --> 00:58:48,800
- I'll leave you two ...
- No, stay, please don't go.

522
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:52,911
- He can stay.
- Whatever you want.

523
00:58:55,282 --> 00:58:57,548
You fainted because your heart was to weak-

524
00:58:57,633 --> 00:58:59,523
-to pump enough blood to your brain.

525
00:58:59,524 --> 00:59:01,571
It's the (  ) starting to shut down.

526
00:59:03,114 --> 00:59:05,115
How long?

527
00:59:05,191 --> 00:59:07,192
It's entirely up to your heart.

528
00:59:07,376 --> 00:59:09,373
Could be ...

529
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:11,374
... six weeks could be a month.

530
00:59:11,983 --> 00:59:13,984
But we've upped you to status 1B.

531
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,085
- At least I'm on the list.
- Not only that, but ...

532
00:59:20,674 --> 00:59:22,676
We're giving you this pager.

533
00:59:22,975 --> 00:59:26,093
And when it goes of, means you have a donor.

534
00:59:30,913 --> 00:59:32,800
The energic drug I started you on

535
00:59:32,801 --> 00:59:35,471
Is gonna stabilize your blood
preasure within 24 hours.

536
00:59:37,344 --> 00:59:40,183
- And then what?
- We wait.

537
00:59:41,689 --> 00:59:44,772
- Can I do that at home?
- Once you're stable, you can.

538
00:59:45,822 --> 00:59:47,824
Okay.

539
01:00:00,594 --> 01:00:03,225
I'm gonna run to the cafeteria
and I'm gonna get you something.

540
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:07,633
If you want something else,
I can get you something else.

541
01:00:11,802 --> 01:00:13,383
Would you stay?

542
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:19,158
Unless you got something else
to do ...

543
01:00:22,061 --> 01:00:24,189
I'd really like it if you'd stayed.

544
01:00:24,224 --> 01:00:26,224
I don't have anything.

545
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:51,385
- Hey, hey. What the hell is that thing?
- It's a dog. Just for one night.

546
01:00:51,646 --> 01:00:55,833
Hold on. I don't give two shits. Okay?
We have a dog policy here.

547
01:00:55,867 --> 01:00:59,931
Little dogs only. Poodles and shitzus.
It's in the contract.

548
01:00:59,965 --> 01:01:02,366
In English and Spanish
For evryone to see.

549
01:01:02,401 --> 01:01:06,389
Besides,that my friend, is not a dog.
It's a goddamn horse.

550
01:01:07,307 --> 01:01:11,078
Let me know when you have a
horse policy to the contract.

551
01:01:38,156 --> 01:01:39,958
Yes.

552
01:01:39,959 --> 01:01:43,528
- Mr. Thomas, this is Connie Tapos.
- Hey, Connie ...

553
01:01:43,562 --> 01:01:47,097
<i> I do not know why I'm calling you, </i>

554
01:01:47,132 --> 01:01:49,790
but I'm calling you.

555
01:01:51,034 --> 01:01:54,850
You said you can help us,
can you really help us?

556
01:01:56,804 --> 01:02:00,595
This just doesn't make any sense.
What if he finds us?

557
01:02:01,631 --> 01:02:03,186
He wont.

558
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,573
- What makes you feel for sure you don't know him ...
- Stop.

559
01:02:04,575 --> 01:02:08,503
- Stop. Don't be weak.

560
01:02:08,503 --> 01:02:11,075
- Don't be weak!
- I'm not weak.

561
01:02:18,242 --> 01:02:21,259
Take this.
Take it.

562
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:28,824
You are gonna start this car.
And you are gonna go.

563
01:02:29,578 --> 01:02:33,971
This is real. And this is gonna
be your new life be your new life.

564
01:02:35,107 --> 01:02:37,765
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

565
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:41,020
Look at those babies.

566
01:02:41,451 --> 01:02:44,500
- Look how beautiful those babies are are.
- Yes, I know.

567
01:02:46,703 --> 01:02:48,781
They deserve it.

568
01:02:51,212 --> 01:02:52,549
Okay?

569
01:02:54,817 --> 01:02:58,524
<i> You're headed north up the coast. </i>

<i> I have always believed
this place can heal the soul. </i>

572
01:03:36,952 --> 01:03:40,237
<i> I hope that proves true for you. </i>

573
01:03:59,856 --> 01:04:03,305
<i> When you've signed your name
on the dotted line of the contract, </i>

574
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:06,728
<i> you'll own my house outright. </i>

575
01:04:08,652 --> 01:04:11,520
<i> I only ask that you'll never
mention how you got the house </i>

576
01:04:11,555 --> 01:04:15,263
<i> or try to contact me, for any reason. </i>

577
01:04:19,312 --> 01:04:24,079
<i> And if you're wondering "why you"
please stop. </i>

578
01:04:30,747 --> 01:04:33,970
<i>All I ask is for you to honor my wishes. </i>

579
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:40,973
<i> And, of course,

580
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:56,164
Thanks.

581
01:04:56,164 --> 01:04:59,822
Hi, Duke.
Hi, baby.

582
01:05:01,358 --> 01:05:05,824
- What time does the nurse come?
- She should be there by the time I get home.

583
01:05:09,970 --> 01:05:12,200
- Ben?
- Yes.

584
01:05:13,483 --> 01:05:16,831
I know I am the girl with the broken wing ...

585
01:05:17,641 --> 01:05:19,887
But who are you?

586
01:05:19,921 --> 01:05:22,098
Who am I ...

587
01:05:22,133 --> 01:05:25,080
I'm you friendly
neighbourhood tax collector.

588
01:05:25,382 --> 01:05:27,383
Ben.

589
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:30,833
Where the hell did you come from?

590
01:05:33,416 --> 01:05:39,418
- I grew up in Oakland.
- Literally, okay.

591
01:05:42,052 --> 01:05:44,052
Where did you go to college?

592
01:05:44,428 --> 01:05:47,777
As far from Oakland as possible.

593
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:52,653
Massachussets Institute of Technology.
How about you?

594
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:56,101
UCLA.

595
01:05:57,573 --> 01:06:03,447
You went to MIT?
Like, The MIT?

596
01:06:05,326 --> 01:06:11,330
And now you're wondering how I
wound up as a lowly tax collector?

597
01:06:11,504 --> 01:06:13,504
Absolutely.

598
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:20,328
I sort of stumbled into this job.

599
01:06:20,363 --> 01:06:22,485
That's a big stumble.

600
01:06:23,832 --> 01:06:25,924
What from?

601
01:06:27,282 --> 01:06:30,259
I always wanted to be an engineer.

602
01:06:30,488 --> 01:06:35,988
An engineer. What kind?

603
01:06:37,081 --> 01:06:42,342
- The kind that sent people to the moon.
- Really?

604
01:06:43,276 --> 01:06:47,200
Yes ... I don't wanna talk about me, anymore.

605
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:52,953
That's too bad ...
Cuz' you're very interesting.

606
01:07:04,607 --> 01:07:07,316
Have you ever been in love?

607
01:07:07,937 --> 01:07:09,782
Emily, please ...

608
01:07:12,818 --> 01:07:17,316
Yes, you have,
Come on, you can tell me.

609
01:07:19,187 --> 01:07:22,785
Yes. But it ended.

610
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:27,632
- What happened?
- Stop it.

611
01:07:27,667 --> 01:07:29,669
- Seriously, you could tell me ...
- Stop it.

612
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:34,368
You need to get some rest.

613
01:07:35,343 --> 01:07:39,509
I'll call you tomorrow.
Or maybe I'll stop by.

614
01:07:42,596 --> 01:07:46,823
No. If I have questions
tomorrow, what then?

615
01:07:47,713 --> 01:07:51,138
That's not a part of the deal.

616
01:07:51,637 --> 01:07:54,580
What the hell does that mean?

617
01:08:14,517 --> 01:08:17,179
Emily, hold on.

618
01:08:18,022 --> 01:08:22,138
- Just leave ...
- Emily, wait. Wait!

619
01:08:33,088 --> 01:08:36,244
Thank You
for everything you did.

620
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:12,978
- Díd you like the eggs?
- They're okay, I guess.

621
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:21,341
- I don't like the eggs you got.
- Okay.

622
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:48,970
You're wearing suit pants.

623
01:09:49,631 --> 01:09:54,770
- To weed.
- I didn't have any other clothes with me.

624
01:09:56,198 --> 01:10:01,010
- You know, I was gonna get to this.
- I saw them the other day and I figured-

625
01:10:01,043 --> 01:10:04,490
-I would just take the day off,
and get this done for you.

626
01:10:06,742 --> 01:10:09,356
- Ben.
- Yes?

627
01:10:10,087 --> 01:10:13,556
This is a really ridiculous apology.

628
01:10:19,183 --> 01:10:22,516
Come on.
I wanna show you something.

629
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,797
No, I gotta  finish.

630
01:10:26,354 --> 01:10:28,717
You can finish tomorrow.

631
01:10:29,797 --> 01:10:31,798
Come on.

632
01:10:46,706 --> 01:10:49,008
This is where I used to work.

633
01:10:49,502 --> 01:10:52,683
And these are the artefacts
of said work.

634
01:10:53,383 --> 01:10:56,402
Those are great.
How old are they?

635
01:10:57,365 --> 01:11:02,461
This one, is just
shy of 120 years.

636
01:11:03,231 --> 01:11:06,102
That's how I put up my
line of wedding press cards,

637
01:11:06,137 --> 01:11:08,545
wedding invataions, invites.

638
01:11:08,884 --> 01:11:10,885
How about this one?

639
01:11:11,262 --> 01:11:15,472
That youngster ...
Hidelberg Windmill.

640
01:11:15,506 --> 01:11:20,530
1956. I call it "The Beast".

641
01:11:21,246 --> 01:11:23,672
That seems appropriate.

642
01:11:23,874 --> 01:11:29,392
Pooped out on me in about five years ago
and I can't find anybody to fix it.

643
01:11:29,426 --> 01:11:32,221
It's kind of a dying art.

644
01:11:32,255 --> 01:11:34,981
Defibrilator here works though.

645
01:11:35,016 --> 01:11:36,785
Luckily, kept my business afloat.

646
01:11:36,786 --> 01:11:37,605
You wanna see how?

647
01:11:37,605 --> 01:11:39,606
Please.

648
01:11:41,612 --> 01:11:46,620
Now, true pressman hate, a modern
girl, who want a decompression

649
01:11:47,085 --> 01:11:51,637
So for a hundred years they tried their damndess,

650
01:11:51,671 --> 01:11:57,674
just to kiss it
so it didn't leave an indictation

651
01:11:59,059 --> 01:12:04,465
That's the only way to prove it's not digital.

652
01:12:07,262 --> 01:12:09,263
I think it feels richer.

653
01:12:12,216 --> 01:12:15,408
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

654
01:12:20,368 --> 01:12:26,370
I don't really know anything about
you or where you came from, But.

655
01:12:27,835 --> 01:12:30,381
You keep showing up.

656
01:12:33,284 --> 01:12:36,003
And I'm glad.

657
01:12:36,961 --> 01:12:38,963
Okay.

658
01:12:40,192 --> 01:12:45,430
Okay, So,
Duke needs a walk.

659
01:12:45,699 --> 01:12:47,700
Are you interested?

660
01:12:48,033 --> 01:12:50,034
Yes.

661
01:13:12,690 --> 01:13:15,484
He's lika a different dog with you around.

662
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:18,487
I don't think we
ever properly bonded.

663
01:13:20,114 --> 01:13:23,887
Why would you get, such a big dog?

664
01:13:26,458 --> 01:13:32,400
Did you know that Great Danes, on average,
only live about seven years?

665
01:13:34,149 --> 01:13:36,837
They have heart issues.

666
01:13:38,651 --> 01:13:41,650
I think I got him because-

667
01:13:41,684 --> 01:13:45,054
-I thought he could help me
with my illness.

668
01:13:45,089 --> 01:13:50,209
There would be something I could take care of
as supposed to being always taken care of.

669
01:13:54,856 --> 01:13:58,280
And just so you know,
I used to be really hot.

670
01:13:59,771 --> 01:14:03,173
Like, unaditebly hot.

671
01:14:03,437 --> 01:14:06,892
- Is that so?
- Yeah .

672
01:14:14,246 --> 01:14:18,291
I've never felt like
this in a really long time.

673
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:29,649
There are so many things
that I want to do.

674
01:14:33,029 --> 01:14:36,311
I wanna go on a plane for 13 hours
and not have to stress that-

675
01:14:36,351 --> 01:14:38,932
-I can't reach my doctor.

676
01:14:41,159 --> 01:14:45,161
You know like just travel,
go backpacking, have experiences.

677
01:14:46,247 --> 01:14:48,937
To see the world.

678
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:52,461
I just wanna have the time to

679
01:14:55,118 --> 01:14:57,987
-you know? what I like.

680
01:14:59,743 --> 01:15:03,227
Do things, try things.
Get out of my head for once.

681
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:10,898
I would really like to go running.

682
01:15:12,749 --> 01:15:18,251
I think about that sometimes.
How it would just feel like, to go running.

683
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:55,150
So-

684
01:15:59,251 --> 01:16:00,351
Yes.

685
01:16:01,285 --> 01:16:06,776
But if you need anything, just call.
And I'll come right back.

686
01:16:07,877 --> 01:16:09,336
Okay.

687
01:16:16,187 --> 01:16:18,188
Bye.

688
01:16:29,658 --> 01:16:33,190
- I had a really great time today.
- Me too.

689
01:16:34,912 --> 01:16:36,913
Bye.

690
01:20:47,325 --> 01:20:50,541
No anesthetic.
Have you ever donated bone marrow before?

691
01:20:51,017 --> 01:20:52,611
You're a brave guy.

692
01:20:55,318 --> 01:20:57,583
How long have you known Nicolas?

693
01:21:07,425 --> 01:21:09,077
What the hell happened to you?

694
01:21:11,903 --> 01:21:14,183
How much longer are you going to stay
at my hotel?

695
01:21:14,217 --> 01:21:17,310
- Motel.
- How much longer?

696
01:21:18,555 --> 01:21:22,286
Acctually I was planning on dying here.

697
01:22:17,961 --> 01:22:18,696
Hello?

698
01:22:19,407 --> 01:22:22,893
Hey, it's Emily.
Are you sleeping?

699
01:22:24,463 --> 01:22:27,257
Yes. No.

700
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:33,334
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

701
01:22:34,831 --> 01:22:40,273
My sister came over, a couple of days last
week with the kids, it was really great.

702
01:22:41,857 --> 01:22:46,357
<i> I tried calling you, a
couple of times. How are you doing? </i>

703
01:22:46,617 --> 01:22:50,025
Yeah, I'm good.
Everything is fine.

704
01:22:52,153 --> 01:22:55,985
I've been traveling.
A lot. So.

705
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:01,219
Are you busy tonight?

706
01:23:03,261 --> 01:23:04,796
What do you mean?

707
01:23:05,716 --> 01:23:10,908
Maybe you wanna come by and
say hello, around seven?

708
01:23:12,468 --> 01:23:15,329
<i> You don't have to if you don't want to.
I just, you know </i>

709
01:23:19,992 --> 01:23:23,722
Look, I totally get it if you don't
wanna hang out with the dying girl so,

710
01:23:26,971 --> 01:23:30,958
- I can come at seven.
- Okay.

711
01:23:32,698 --> 01:23:34,698
Okay.

712
01:23:36,061 --> 01:23:37,562
Bye.

713
01:24:22,905 --> 01:24:25,754
Oh, well,
how are you doing tonight?

714
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:30,877
- Hi.
- Hi.

715
01:24:31,111 --> 01:24:35,163
Come in.
I am so glad she's gone.

716
01:24:35,439 --> 01:24:40,149
- Are you okay if we eat outside?
- Eating?

717
01:24:40,192 --> 01:24:43,257
- Yes, you didn't eat already did you?
- No.

718
01:24:45,299 --> 01:24:48,666
- No.
- Well, it was a surprise, but.

719
01:24:49,882 --> 01:24:52,071
You're on time.

720
01:24:55,045 --> 01:24:57,604
I haven't cooked anybody food,
for years so.

721
01:24:58,141 --> 01:24:59,211
You better like it,

722
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:01,526
Or lie to me.

723
01:25:04,799 --> 01:25:06,278
This is for you.

724
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:11,842
You don't have to say anything, I just got,
change, in there.

725
01:25:12,527 --> 01:25:16,267
Dinner is ready, and you're not.
So Hurry up.

726
01:25:17,501 --> 01:25:19,302
Chop chop!

727
01:26:19,530 --> 01:26:23,942
- You look great.
- Yes ... It's pink.

728
01:26:24,583 --> 01:26:26,640
It's salmon.

729
01:26:39,526 --> 01:26:41,723
You are so nice.

730
01:26:43,385 --> 01:26:45,010
So are you.

731
01:26:52,524 --> 01:26:54,525
Everything is vegetarian.

732
01:26:56,429 --> 01:26:58,916
I hope you like eggplant parmesan..

733
01:27:02,404 --> 01:27:07,707
I haven't treated myself, very well
in the past few years.

734
01:27:10,519 --> 01:27:12,900
Start now.

735
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:19,900
Bon appetit!

736
01:27:29,605 --> 01:27:31,206
What do you think?

737
01:27:35,955 --> 01:27:37,794
It's delicious!

738
01:27:40,618 --> 01:27:42,485
I'm glad you like it.

739
01:28:22,326 --> 01:28:24,478
Do you want to hear my favourite song??

740
01:28:25,405 --> 01:28:28,523
Yes. Are you gonna sing it?

741
01:28:32,096 --> 01:28:37,642
- No, I can't sing anymore.
- End of performance

742
01:28:38,113 --> 01:28:40,113
No.

743
01:29:23,390 --> 01:29:25,209
Shall we?

744
01:29:44,359 --> 01:29:48,683
- You need to relax.
- The guest is relaxed.

745
01:30:20,701 --> 01:30:23,005
I have a surprise for you.

746
01:30:25,136 --> 01:30:28,621
- Surprise?
- Yes.

747
01:30:30,117 --> 01:30:32,117
For me?

748
01:30:35,075 --> 01:30:37,962
- Getting close.
- Okay.

749
01:30:44,298 --> 01:30:46,498
And, open.

750
01:31:00,609 --> 01:31:03,325
You cleaned The Beast.

751
01:31:03,759 --> 01:31:06,881
Actually, I fixed it.

752
01:31:06,916 --> 01:31:11,615
- No you didn't.
- Okay, let's go then.

753
01:31:11,989 --> 01:31:15,244
- Are you serious?
- Try it.

754
01:32:09,738 --> 01:32:11,239
Thank you!

755
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:54,282
-Wait right here.
-Okay.

756
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:58,252
I'll be right back,
wait right here.

757
01:33:01,032 --> 01:33:02,533
One second, alright.

758
01:33:16,317 --> 01:33:18,281
Tell me what's going on.

759
01:33:20,971 --> 01:33:25,126
- Ben. Ben, you need to go home.
- Do you know they keep a full history-

760
01:33:25,293 --> 01:33:27,908
Do you know they keep a full history
of every inquiry a revenue officer makes ?

761
01:33:28,075 --> 01:33:29,651
- Do you understand that?
- Keep your voice down.

762
01:33:29,686 --> 01:33:31,759
- Just keep your voice down.
- No, Tim, what you are doing is a crime.

763
01:33:32,093 --> 01:33:35,441
You are impersonating a federal officer.
It's a felony!

764
01:33:37,039 --> 01:33:39,745
You can't play with peoples lives,
do you understand that?

765
01:33:41,650 --> 01:33:43,489
Alright,
There's a coffee shop-

766
01:33:44,023 --> 01:33:45,345
-there's a coffe shop, right
near where I'm staying

767
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:48,532
- Tomorrow we ...
- Where are you staying, Tim?

768
01:33:49,068 --> 01:33:51,516
Tell me, because I don't know
Where my own brother lives!

769
01:33:52,054 --> 01:33:56,373
It's a motel. Five blocks from here.
We'll sit down, tomorrow morning, I guarantee ...

770
01:33:57,206 --> 01:34:00,120
Where are my credentials?
Give me my credentials back!

771
01:34:07,995 --> 01:34:09,196
Here.

772
01:34:10,615 --> 01:34:13,010
Just go home.
You have a beautiful family.

773
01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:18,286
- Go home and enjoy 'em ...
- Tim. Why are you even here?

774
01:34:18,321 --> 01:34:20,392
Tell me, who is Emily Posa?

775
01:34:23,221 --> 01:34:25,464
I'll explain everything tomorrow.

776
01:34:31,115 --> 01:34:33,136
Give me your car keys.

777
01:34:40,259 --> 01:34:41,632
I'm not going anywhere.

778
01:34:42,958 --> 01:34:45,734
I'm gonna be right here

779
01:34:48,622 --> 01:34:51,154
Remember I love you,
and ...

780
01:34:52,788 --> 01:34:57,132
Tim, don't make me come knock on the door,
okay?

781
01:35:20,789 --> 01:35:23,397
I didn't realize how late it was.

782
01:35:27,757 --> 01:35:32,009
And I have a really long drive.
So, I need to go.

783
01:35:35,578 --> 01:35:38,808
I don't wanna keep lying to you.
I don't wanna ...

784
01:37:42,561 --> 01:37:44,376
Do you want to play a game?

785
01:37:45,846 --> 01:37:47,647
What game?

786
01:37:50,296 --> 01:37:52,421
The "What if" game.

787
01:37:53,861 --> 01:37:56,643
"The 'What if' game".

788
01:37:58,298 --> 01:38:00,082
What if-

789
01:38:01,673 --> 01:38:03,801
-my pager goes off.

790
01:38:08,152 --> 01:38:10,634
And It's a heart?

791
01:38:11,432 --> 01:38:14,790
And, it works.

792
01:38:16,116 --> 01:38:19,516
And my body doesn't reject it.

793
01:38:20,862 --> 01:38:22,864
And-

794
01:38:27,277 --> 01:38:29,512
what if I have time?

795
01:38:43,524 --> 01:38:45,673
What if ...

796
01:38:50,354 --> 01:38:52,881
What if we have children?

797
01:38:58,475 --> 01:39:01,311
What if we got married?
827
01:39:11,842 --> 01:39:13,315
- I love you.
- I love you too.

798
01:39:17,318 --> 01:39:19,319
I love you!

799
01:41:14,839 --> 01:41:16,439
Hi.

800
01:41:16,744 --> 01:41:21,717
- Is Dr Briar on duty tonight?
- She is doing her rounds.

801
01:41:22,251 --> 01:41:27,189
Can you tell her it's Ben Thomas?
It's very important.

802
01:41:27,612 --> 01:41:30,937
- I'll page her.
- Thank you.

803
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:34,938
<i> Dr Briar to the nursey station. </i>

804
01:42:00,970 --> 01:42:02,571
Hry.

805
01:42:03,033 --> 01:42:05,183
-  Is it Emily?
- No.

806
01:42:08,443 --> 01:42:09,444
I'm sorry.

807
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:15,379
Is there ...

808
01:42:17,727 --> 01:42:19,028
Sorry.

809
01:42:20,878 --> 01:42:24,880
Do you have any, more optimism-

810
01:42:25,068 --> 01:42:29,099
-about Emily, than you did the other day?

811
01:42:34,801 --> 01:42:37,685
When you're looking for a donor
with a rare blood type ...

812
01:42:39,837 --> 01:42:42,989
- The odds go way down.
- To what?

813
01:42:45,089 --> 01:42:47,473
They go down what,
Give me a percentage.

814
01:42:49,890 --> 01:42:50,863
Give me a number!

815
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:54,177
Three
five percent

816
01:42:57,010 --> 01:42:58,357
I'm sorry ...
I wish the numbers were higher ...

817
01:42:58,592 --> 01:42:59,392
Thank you.

818
01:43:47,258 --> 01:43:47,607
Hello?

819
01:43:49,609 --> 01:43:50,609
Dan.

820
01:43:52,024 --> 01:43:53,025
It's time.

821
01:43:53,818 --> 01:43:56,519
I love you.

822
01:44:51,051 --> 01:44:53,011
<i> 1:38 AM </i>

823
01:44:57,801 --> 01:45:00,855
- Hello?
- Ezra.

824
01:45:03,962 --> 01:45:05,835
My name is Ben Thomas.

825
01:45:08,094 --> 01:45:11,035
I called you a few weeks ago,
you probably don't remember.

826
01:45:12,898 --> 01:45:14,897
I do, remember.

827
01:45:16,073 --> 01:45:16,656
I want to apologize for being so cruel to you

828
01:45:19,312 --> 01:45:21,095
But I had to be certain.

829
01:45:22,055 --> 01:45:26,326
I had to be certain that you were a
descent man, kind, slow to anger.

830
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:31,064
- What do you want from me?
- I want to give you a gift.

831
01:45:32,451 --> 01:45:38,001
You're gonna be contacted
by a man named Dan Morris.

832
01:45:38,008 --> 01:45:42,638
- You can trust him.
- Was that you, at the diner?

833
01:45:44,696 --> 01:45:46,600
Goodbye.

834
01:46:08,705 --> 01:46:09,761
<i> 911 emergency. </i>

835
01:46:15,348 --> 01:46:16,277
I need an ambulance.

836
01:46:17,313 --> 01:46:20,247
<i> I have you at 9212 West Third Street
in Los Angeles. </i>

837
01:46:25,038 --> 01:46:25,966
Yes, room number two.

838
01:46:28,001 --> 01:46:28,794
<i>What's the emergency? </i>

839
01:46:32,085 --> 01:46:34,051
There's been a suicide.

840
01:46:34,287 --> 01:46:35,269
<i> Who's the victim? </i>

841
01:46:38,148 --> 01:46:39,007
I am.

842
01:46:40,671 --> 01:46:45,148
- You are really gonna need to
stop looking at that thing.
- Why? Is it gonna crack?

843
01:46:45,945 --> 01:46:48,005
No, no ... I've paid extra for
the non cracking kind.

844
01:46:48,905 --> 01:46:50,906
I bet you did ...

845
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:54,149
- Honey, why don't you just tutn that off?
- I'm sorry. No more work.

846
01:46:54,384 --> 01:46:57,086
Almost done.

847
01:49:54,021 --> 01:49:55,334
We have procedures ...

848
01:49:55,347 --> 01:49:58,588
I understand, but she needs that heart
or she's gonna to die!

849
01:50:20,068 --> 01:50:20,907
Ben?

850
01:50:20,908 --> 01:50:22,569
One, two, three ...

851
01:50:40,222 --> 01:50:45,220
How are you doing?

852
01:52:47,457 --> 01:52:50,340
About a year after the accident, I got sick,
I got,

853
01:52:52,481 --> 01:52:56,171
I got lung cancer.
I needed a double-lobe transplant.

854
01:52:58,242 --> 01:53:00,894
Tim could only give me one, of course.

855
01:53:05,905 --> 01:53:08,906
-about six months later he,

856
01:53:10,616 --> 01:53:13,718
He donated the right part of his liver
to this woman.

857
01:53:16,937 --> 01:53:19,191
Her name is,  Holly.

858
01:56:00,633 --> 01:56:04,543
I'm proud of you.
Very proud. Congratulations.

859
01:56:06,402 --> 01:56:10,264
- Ezra.
- Yeah. Hi.

860
01:56:12,464 --> 01:56:14,265
Are you a parent?

861
01:56:15,305 --> 01:56:16,807
No.

862
01:56:18,776 --> 01:56:20,830
Have we met?

863
01:56:25,954 --> 01:56:27,655
Are you okay?

864
01:56:41,242 --> 01:56:43,177
You must be Emily.

865
01:56:49,209 --> 01:56:50,710
Yes.

866
01:56:53,413 --> 01:56:56,225
It's so nice to meet you.
