1
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,169
<i>My friends on the mainland think just because
I live in Hawaii, I live in paradise.</i>

2
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,885
<i>Like a permanent vacation.</i>

3
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,642
<i>We're all just out here sipping mai tais,
shaking our hips, and catching waves.</i>

4
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,763
<i>Are they insane?
Do they think we 're immune to life?</i>

5
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,679
<i>How can they possibly think our
families are less screwed up...</i>

6
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,999
<i>...our cancers less fatal...</i>

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,205
<i>...our heartaches less painful?</i>

8
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,131
<i>Hell, I haven't been on a
surfboard in 15 years.</i>

9
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,919
<i>For the last 23 days...</i>

10
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,848
<i>...I've been living in a paradise of IVs
and urine bags and tracheal tubes.</i>

11
00:02:06,883 --> 00:02:08,569
<i>Paradise?</i>

12
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,926
<i>Paradise can go fuck itself.</i>

13
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,724
<i>This is Elizabeth
Thorson King, my wife.</i>

14
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,006
<i>Twenty-three days ago...</i>

15
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:28,639
<i>...she was launched from a powerboat
during a race and hit her head.</i>

16
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,919
<i>Almost drowned.</i>

17
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,609
<i>When I heard about the accident and
about the coma, I wasn't even in town.</i>

18
00:02:36,644 --> 00:02:41,925
<i>I was on Maui, on business, and
we hadn't spoken in three days.</i>

19
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,603
<i>In a way, we hadn't
really spoken in months.</i>

20
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,879
<i>If you're doing this to get my
attention, Liz, it's working.</i>

21
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,839
<i>I'm ready now.</i>

22
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,799
<i>I'm ready to talk.
I'm ready to change.</i>

23
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,043
<i>I'm ready to be a real
husband and a real father.</i>

24
00:03:02,078 --> 00:03:04,202
<i>Just wake up.</i>

25
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,281
<i>Please, Liz, just wake up.</i>

26
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,085
Hey Noe, what's up?

27
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,485
<i>Matt, Scottie's teacher's
on the phone.</i>

28
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,845
<i>She says it's urgent.</i>

29
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:18,842
Okay, put her on.

30
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,289
We don't think these
photographs...

31
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,399
...are appropriate for Scottie to
be sharing with her classmates.

32
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,279
Some of them went home quite disturbed,
and we got some angry calls from parents.

33
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,919
Yeah, she's kind of been going to town
on this whole picture-taking thing.

34
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,439
I had no idea.
Mr. King, we see this every day.

35
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,399
Children acting out in school
when something is wrong at home.

36
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,479
And your family is facing
a devastating crisis.

37
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,166
Have you been engaging Scottie in talking
about everything that's going on?

38
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:51,446
Yes, yes, absolutely.

39
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:53,959
Encouraging her to
express her feelings?

40
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,439
That's crucial. Mm-hm.
I understand.

41
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,240
What's the matter with you, showing those
pictures of Mom for your art project?

42
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:02,481
I'm a photographer, Dad,
a real photographer.

43
00:04:02,482 --> 00:04:04,801
No. You're overdoing it,
is what you're doing.

44
00:04:04,836 --> 00:04:06,006
I saw it in a book.

45
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:10,159
Some famous photographer lady took
pictures of her mom in the hospital...

46
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,845
...while she was dying, and
they're considered art.

47
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,126
That's what I'm doing.

48
00:04:14,127 --> 00:04:17,119
First of all, your mother is
very sick, but she isn't dying.

49
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,199
And second of all, we don't share
personal stuff with strangers.

50
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,439
What's going on with
your mom is private.

51
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,999
I'm hungry.
Can we get burgers? No.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,679
<i>The last time I took care of Scottie
by myself was when she was 3.</i>

53
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,479
<i>Now she's 10, and I have no
idea what to do with her.</i>

54
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,245
But I wanna eat now,
not in an hour.

55
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,363
<i>And with Elizabeth in the
hospital, she's testing me.</i>

56
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,519
<i>I'm the backup parent,
the understudy.</i>

57
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,127
This is Matt King. I'm returning your call.
How can I help you?

58
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:48,122
<i>It's your daughter Scottie.</i>

59
00:04:48,123 --> 00:04:52,079
<i>She's been texting some awful things to my
daughter, Lani, and I'd like her to stop.</i>

60
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,719
<i>Huh.</i>

61
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,479
<i>"We all know you grew
pubes over the summer. "</i>

62
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,405
<i>I mean, my daughter can't help it if she's
developing a little early for her age.</i>

63
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,404
<i>You think that's nice?
Well, that's not like her at all.</i>

64
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,999
She's usually very sweet.

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,879
As you may know, her mother isn't well.
Maybe this is how she's dealing with it.

66
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,879
<i>I'm very sorry about your
family situation, Mr. King...</i>

67
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,719
<i>...but my daughter comes
home from school in tears.</i>

68
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,965
Yeah, no, I get it I'm sorry.

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,048
<i>Scottie's the one who
should be sorry.</i>

70
00:05:21,049 --> 00:05:23,079
<i>I want her to come
over and apologize...</i>

71
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,119
<i>...and I don't ever want her
to text my daughter again.</i>

72
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,567
<i>If she doesn't apologize, I'll
take it up with the dean.</i>

73
00:05:29,602 --> 00:05:32,245
<i>You can't buy your
way out of this.</i>

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,889
Can you give me an address?

75
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,364
Thank you for coming by.

76
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,085
Hi.

77
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,079
I forgot to mention Scottie said she didn't
wanna be Lani's partner at the rock wall...

78
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,129
...because she didn't wanna fall
into my daughter's butt crack.

79
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:07,169
That doesn't even make sense.
Ah.

80
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,239
<i>Shirts off. Shirts off.</i>

81
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,639
<i>Good, good, good, good job.</i>

82
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,925
<i>I don't think she has any idea.</i>

83
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,725
<i>That was very good, Bobby Brown.
Yeah. Here.</i>

84
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,239
<i>Because she goes, "I'm living at this.
I'll meet you out in front. " So...</i>

85
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,961
Scottie, you have something
you wanna say to Lani?

86
00:06:26,996 --> 00:06:28,724
Sorry.

87
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,607
<i>He knows he's going
away for a while.</i>

88
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,159
<i>If he's got a chance, he's bolting. Great.
Well, it was nice meeting you both.</i>

89
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,159
You should come over for a swim
or a hike or something, okay?

90
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,125
I don't think she's
sorry at all.

91
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,164
- She's gonna keep on doing it, I can tell.
- No, she won't.

92
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,849
Look. Scottie, you're
gonna stop, right?

93
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,126
And you're really,
really sorry, right?

94
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,966
<i>Seems like every time I forget to pray,
we don't catch a guy for three days.</i>

95
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:58,530
<i>I know, I'm telling you, man.</i>

96
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,540
Oh, and, Mr. King? Yeah?

97
00:07:03,575 --> 00:07:05,080
Good luck with the sale.

98
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,439
They say your decision will have a major
impact on Hawaii's real-estate world.

99
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,761
Not to mention the whole
landscape of Kauai.

100
00:07:12,796 --> 00:07:15,001
Hundreds of millions
of dollars, yeah?

101
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,239
Yeah. It's a big decision.

102
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,519
My husband's family's from Kauai.
Hanapepe, born and bred.

103
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,047
They hope you don't sell.
You don't say.

104
00:07:26,082 --> 00:07:28,646
All that traffic
it's gonna make.

105
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,441
<i>As if Liz's coma weren't
enough already...</i>

106
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:38,079
<i>...the whole goddamn state
is following my decision...</i>

107
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,607
<i>...on who's gonna buy 25,000
pristine acres on Kauai...</i>

108
00:07:41,642 --> 00:07:44,490
<i>...that my family has
owned since the 1860s.</i>

109
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,443
<i>A lot of my cousins are broke, and the
sale will make us all very, very rich.</i>

110
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,479
<i>My family meets in six
days to approve a buyer.</i>

111
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,723
<i>But ever since my father died,
I'm the sole trustee...</i>

112
00:07:57,758 --> 00:08:01,088
<i>...which means I alone
hold all the cards.</i>

113
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,359
<i>My great-great-grandmother was
Princess Margaret Ke'alohilani...</i>

114
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,083
<i>...one of the last direct
descendants of King Kamehameha.</i>

115
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:14,806
<i>She was originally supposed
to marry her cousin...</i>

116
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:17,759
<i>...but she fell in love with
Edward King, her haole banker...</i>

117
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,039
<i>...whose parents had
been missionaries.</i>

118
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,079
<i>Between his land deals and
her huge inheritance...</i>

119
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,365
<i>...generations of their
descendants, all of us...</i>

120
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,691
<i>...have watched the past unfurl millions
into our laps through leases and sales.</i>

121
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,439
<i>Now something called the rule
against perpetuities...</i>

122
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,725
<i>...is forcing us to
dissolve the trust...</i>

123
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,368
<i>...and we're selling our last huge
parcel of virgin Hawaiian land.</i>

124
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,727
<i>Unlike a lot of my cousins, I haven't
blown my share of the trust money.</i>

125
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,449
<i>Just like my father before me...</i>

126
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,359
<i>...I live only on the income
from my law practice.</i>

127
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,839
<i>I don't want my daughters growing
up spoiled and entitled.</i>

128
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,439
<i>Liz always accuses me of stinginess,
but I agree with my father.</i>

129
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,479
<i>You give your children enough money to do
something, but not enough to do nothing.</i>

130
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,165
Matt.

131
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,009
Your cousins are here.

132
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,359
<i>Not only am I the sole trustee, but I
specialize in real-estate transaction law...</i>

133
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,410
<i>...so a few of the more involved cousins
have been meeting with me to analyze bids.</i>

134
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:23,606
Hey. How's it, Matt?

135
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:27,399
<i>Cousin Hal, Cousin
Milo, Cousin Stan...</i>

136
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,559
<i>...Cousin Six, Cousin
Wink, Cousin Connie...</i>

137
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,279
How you doing? Okay?

138
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,119
<i>...and Cousin Dave, both of
whom oppose the sale entirely.</i>

139
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,999
<i>- Good to see you.
- Don't be fooled by appearances.</i>

140
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,719
<i>In Hawaii, some of the most powerful
people look like bums and stuntmen.</i>

141
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,445
All right, so where are we?

142
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,289
<i>Proposals are
virtually the same.</i>

143
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,279
<i>Hotels, shopping centers,
condos and golf courses.</i>

144
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,839
I have some major concerns...

145
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,679
<i>A Chicago group is offering
half a billion dollars.</i>

146
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,319
<i>But we're leaning towards a lower
bid from a guy named Don Holitzer.</i>

147
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,039
<i>He's actually from Kauai.
Made a fortune in Silicon Valley.</i>

148
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,679
<i>Old Cousin Hugh is pushing us in
that direction, and I say, why not?</i>

149
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,519
<i>The money would come from
Hawaii and stay in Hawaii.</i>

150
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,245
There's nothing about saving the heiau.
You know, it's ridiculous.

151
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,285
And there's no beach access like they
say, and that's really, really...

152
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,768
<i>Elizabeth's gonna make it out okay.
I know it.</i>

153
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:25,808
<i>It's not her time yet.</i>

154
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,679
<i>She'll wake up.</i>

155
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,519
<i>Scottie and Alexandra will
have their mother back.</i>

156
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,883
<i>And we'll talk about
our marriage.</i>

157
00:10:35,918 --> 00:10:38,246
<i>I know I can make things right.</i>

158
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,319
<i>I'll sell the land, quit my practice,
and buy her whatever she wants.</i>

159
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,479
<i>A big boat. A house in France.</i>

160
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,563
<i>We'll take a trip around the
world, just the two of us.</i>

161
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:53,167
<i>We'll get close again,
like the early days.</i>

162
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,205
<i>I wish I had better
news, Matthew.</i>

163
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,768
<i>But Dr. Chun and Dr. Mueller and
I agree that her condition...</i>

164
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,599
...it's deteriorating.

165
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,759
She has no eye movement, she
has no pupillary responses...

166
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,519
...she has no brain-stem
reflexes whatsoever.

167
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:19,926
I mean, the machines can keep her alive, but
the quality of her life would be so poor.

168
00:11:19,961 --> 00:11:22,844
Basically the way it is now.

169
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,082
She'll never be the
way she was, Matt.

170
00:11:28,117 --> 00:11:29,605
Never.

171
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,968
We know that now.

172
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,850
Look, uh "

173
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,959
I can't tell you how sorry
I am to tell you this.

174
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,925
And you do have your daughters.

175
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,123
There's just nothing
more that we can do.

176
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,879
So if we do go ahead and
take her off the machines...

177
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,605
There's no "if. "

178
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,964
It's "when. " I have a legal obligation.
You know that.

179
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,919
How long will she last?

180
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,479
Well, it's hard to say.

181
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,639
It could be a few days, it
could be a couple of weeks.

182
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,931
For planning purposes, I think you should
work off the shortest possible scenario.

183
00:12:20,966 --> 00:12:25,289
I know I've gotta get the ball rolling
on the organ donations right away.

184
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,885
Matt.

185
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,170
Elizabeth has many friends.

186
00:12:33,205 --> 00:12:35,288
She has a big life.

187
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,805
If you're gonna let everybody
know to say goodbye...

188
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,528
...which is the typical protocol for
these situations, you start now.

189
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,406
Then when the last day comes...

190
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,600
...they'll feel more ready.

191
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,287
Or as ready as they can feel
for something like this.

192
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,680
I'm so sorry, Matt.

193
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,965
Hey. Hey. There he is.

194
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,764
How's it going? What's going on?

195
00:13:48,765 --> 00:13:51,519
She was looking a little pale
lately, all cooped up here.

196
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,411
I know she'd be mortified if nobody helped
her out with some lipstick and blush.

197
00:13:55,446 --> 00:13:56,686
I know she'll grill me.

198
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:59,604
Of course, Kai's getting her
caught up on the latest gossip.

199
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,604
Well, I don't wanna start
from scratch later.

200
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,769
Oh, and, Matt, uh,
on the way here...

201
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:08,128
...we stopped by and put some meals
in your fridge, all ready to nuke.

202
00:14:08,163 --> 00:14:09,360
Mm-hm.

203
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,761
So, what's the latest, anyway, Matt?
Any updates?

204
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,160
Just more of the same.

205
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:18,004
Just keeping the kidneys and
other vital organs working...

206
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:20,606
...and hoping for the best.

207
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,725
The food at the club is so good.

208
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,524
Yeah, they do a good job here.
Come here.

209
00:15:14,525 --> 00:15:15,806
Mm.

210
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,325
Why is it called a jellyfish?
It's not a fish, it's not jelly.

211
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,651
I have no idea.

212
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,448
You ask good questions, Scottie.
You're getting too smart for me.

213
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,491
I'm gonna ask Mom
when she wakes up.

214
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,083
Do you think she's gonna
know everything she used to?

215
00:15:33,118 --> 00:15:34,730
I don't know.

216
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,889
I'll be right back.

217
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,765
- Hi, Matt. Hi, Scottie.
- Troy.

218
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,327
So, what's going on?
I mean, how's Elizabeth doing?

219
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,165
The same.

220
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,090
Well, you know, I went and
visited her last week...

221
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,564
...and, uh, she
looked pretty good.

222
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,559
Then why'd you ask?
I don't know.

223
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,399
I guess I just wanted to
know what the latest is.

224
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,359
You know, I've been praying for her every
day, you guys, really hard, seriously.

225
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,759
And, well, what I meant to say was
when I was there, I talked to her...

226
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,359
...and she moved her hand.

227
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,399
And then I was, like...
I was encouraged.

228
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,562
I thought that that was
an encouraging sign.

229
00:16:25,597 --> 00:16:27,085
That's enough.

230
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,768
I really think she heard me.
Look, Troy, go to your friends.

231
00:16:31,803 --> 00:16:34,843
There's no hard feelings.
Let's just leave it alone.

232
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,719
I told you, Matt.

233
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,039
The water that day was so choppy.
I've told you a hundred times.

234
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,239
What happened to her
could've happened to me.

235
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,679
The ocean was brutal that day.
Ask anybody.

236
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,919
You weren't supposed to be driving.
She was supposed to be driving.

237
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,479
She wanted me to drive.

238
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,759
She's the one that told me to pass
the other boat before the turn.

239
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,279
You know, it's just your
whole attitude towards me.

240
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,604
I didn't...
You know, I feel terrible about it.

241
00:17:04,639 --> 00:17:07,929
Plus, I almost drowned
myself when the boat caps...

242
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,964
Hey.

243
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,959
Scottie! Hey, Scottie! Scottie!

244
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,805
Hey. Listen.

245
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,683
Don't pay any attention
to that guy.

246
00:17:21,684 --> 00:17:23,762
That guy's a dope. I hate him.

247
00:17:23,797 --> 00:17:25,922
Yeah, I know.

248
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,039
Hey, let's do something crazy.

249
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,119
Let's drive to the airport, we'll
hop over to the Big Island...

250
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,639
...and we'll surprise your sister.
What do you say?

251
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,799
Right now? Yeah, it'll be fun.
She's not expecting us.

252
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,959
And we can bring her home.

253
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,931
I think she should be with us, don't you?
Don't you miss her? I miss her.

254
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:46,890
Yeah. I mean, I'm out of school.
She should be too.

255
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,821
There you go. Okay.

256
00:17:49,856 --> 00:17:52,123
Let's go. Come on.

257
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,842
Hey, Troy.

258
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,079
<i>Somehow it feels natural to find a
daughter of mine on a different island.</i>

259
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,919
<i>A family seems exactly-</i>

260
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,561
<i>All part of the same whole but
still separate and alone...</i>

261
00:18:19,596 --> 00:18:22,530
<i>...and always drifting
slowly apart.</i>

262
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,608
That's the wrong door.

263
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,364
Go back to sleep, Braelynn.
It's okay.

264
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,559
Wake up your roommate, please.

265
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,205
Um, Alex isn't here.
Where is she?

266
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,723
I think she's somewhere outside.
Where outside?

267
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,206
Hit it that way.

268
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:34,827
No, between there. Fuckhead.

269
00:19:34,862 --> 00:19:37,447
Why are you hitting it that way?

270
00:19:37,448 --> 00:19:39,681
You're supposed to be
going through... Dude.

271
00:19:39,682 --> 00:19:42,331
Hey, girls!
What do you think you're doing?

272
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:44,209
- Oh, shit, here.
- Run.

273
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,279
Fuck. Hi, Alex.
It's me, Scottie.

274
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,409
I pay $35,000 a year for this
kind of crap not to happen.

275
00:19:51,444 --> 00:19:54,449
Dad?

276
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,279
My fucking dad is here.

277
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,959
You need to watch your language.
This is unacceptable behavior.

278
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,965
What's up, Dad?

279
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,770
What's happening?

280
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,127
You need to come home
and see your mom.

281
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,128
Fuck Mom.

282
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,640
Really? What did I just
say about the language?

283
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,120
You could get expelled
for all of this.

284
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,291
<i>What is it that makes the women in
my life wanna destroy themselves?</i>

285
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:31,763
<i>Elizabeth with her motorcycles
and speedboats and drinking.</i>

286
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,799
<i>Alexandra with her
drugs and older guys.</i>

287
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,399
<i>And Scottie.</i>

288
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,159
<i>With Elizabeth gone...</i>

289
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,004
<i>...what kind of a chance
will she have with just me?</i>

290
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,490
Go to bed.

291
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,520
All right.

292
00:21:19,555 --> 00:21:21,001
There we go.

293
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,964
I don't like eggs.

294
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,647
Why didn't you tell me before I made them?
I thought they were for you.

295
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,564
Good morning.

296
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,250
How you feeling? Hung over?

297
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,959
Why am I not surprised?

298
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,879
I thought you were supposed to
be getting your act together.

299
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,559
I have gotten my act together.
I was just drinking.

300
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:02,088
I've been doing really well, actually.
Nobody ever seems to notice that.

301
00:22:02,123 --> 00:22:03,286
Grades are better.

302
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:06,045
I was in that stupid play you
guys didn't bother to see.

303
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,168
Do you even remember
the name of it?

304
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,571
That's what I thought.

305
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,359
So what? What if I got drunk on the
one night you happened to stop by?

306
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,919
So fucking what?

307
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,207
Hey, hey, watch your
language around Scottie.

308
00:22:19,242 --> 00:22:20,440
I don't care.

309
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,759
anyway...

310
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,359
Listen, it's nice to see you.

311
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,644
Welcome home. Here.

312
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,929
You want some eggs?

313
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,119
I can't believe that.

314
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,959
What?

315
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,925
Heh. Oh, my God. Uh-huh.

316
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,440
Hey, Alex? Well, what'd she say?

317
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,688
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Uh...

318
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,044
The pool's really dirty.

319
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,126
Uh-huh.

320
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,159
Wait, what?

321
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,811
Hey, I really need to talk to you.
She didn't say...

322
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,802
She didn't say anything to me.

323
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,803
Uh-huh. Ha, ha.

324
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,085
Oh, my God, I can't
believe she...

325
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,569
Hey, uh... Yeah, yeah, I gotta go.
Okay, I'll see you later.

326
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,206
Um...

327
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,846
What day does the pool guy come?
He comes...

328
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,999
You know, I don't know when he comes.
Awesome.

329
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,999
Sid's coming over. Who's Sid?

330
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,279
A really good friend from Punahou.
We were in school together for years.

331
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,365
Oh. Okay.

332
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,563
He wants to be here for me
with all this shit happening.

333
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,330
Do I know his parents? Nope.

334
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,839
He might stay over too. Is that cool?
Hey, Alex, over here.

335
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,359
What the fuck?
Get out of my underwear, you freak.

336
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,199
No. Okay, no, no, no.

337
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,851
Don't I look divine? Back inside.
Put on a swimsuit.

338
00:24:02,886 --> 00:24:05,207
Why? Now.

339
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,124
Real good job you're doing.

340
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,919
That's part of why I
brought you here.

341
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,519
You have to help me.
I don't know what to do with her.

342
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,559
Maybe if you spent more time with her, she
wouldn't act like such a complete spaz.

343
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,479
Get her out of town.
Go camp on Kauai.

344
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,039
That's what Mom used to do with
me whenever I was losing it.

345
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,919
Hey, listen. No, listen.
Listen to me.

346
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,969
Your mother's not well.
Yeah, obviously.

347
00:24:35,004 --> 00:24:36,564
No.

348
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,842
They just told me she's not gonna wake up.
We know for sure now.

349
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,884
The doctors are gonna
stop caring for her.

350
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,207
Your mother wanted it this way.
She has this...

351
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,444
She has this will, see, that says
that we have to do it this way.

352
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:00,363
We both do.

353
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,648
You understand what I'm saying?

354
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,767
That's why I got you.

355
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,566
Honey, we're letting her go.

356
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,399
Why did you have to tell
me in the goddamn pool?

357
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,959
Alex. Alex.

358
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,565
What?

359
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,329
What do you want?

360
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,651
Uh...

361
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,767
I just found out yesterday.

362
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:23,089
We have to go through this thing
together, you and Scottie and me.

363
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,930
And I have to go around and
tell people what's happening.

364
00:26:27,965 --> 00:26:30,446
Family and a few close friends.

365
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,241
Sometimes I'm gonna need
you to come with me.

366
00:26:33,276 --> 00:26:35,846
Sometimes I need you
to watch Scottie.

367
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:43,369
You want me to go around with you and
tell people that Mom's gonna die?

368
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,679
What's the point of that?

369
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:50,119
Breaking the news, watching them
cry, dealing with their emotions?

370
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,679
How depressing is that gonna be?
Just call them.

371
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,039
Alex, nobody wants
to do any of this.

372
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,165
But we have to tell your grandpa
and Tutu and a few friends.

373
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,329
They have the right to know, and
they have the right to say goodbye.

374
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,359
I don't wanna talk
about Mom with anyone.

375
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,559
Look, whatever you two fought about
over Christmas, you have to drop it.

376
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,719
Grow up.

377
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,927
You love your mother,
your mother loves you.

378
00:27:12,962 --> 00:27:15,890
I can't drop it. You have to.

379
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,523
You really don't
have a clue, do you?

380
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,291
Dad...

381
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,243
Dad, Mom was cheating on you.

382
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,281
That is what we fought about.

383
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,561
When I was home at Christmas,
I caught her with a guy.

384
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,763
It made me sick to
see her near you.

385
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,925
I went back to school thinking that that
was it, that I was just done with her.

386
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,890
I was gonna call and tell
you everything and...

387
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,730
And then the accident
happened and...

388
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,649
I was waiting until
she woke up, I guess.

389
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,287
You didn't even suspect, right?

390
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,011
Right?

391
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,287
It disgusted me too.
You're always so busy.

392
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,003
"Caught her with a guy
," what does that mean?

393
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,685
I was on my way to swim in the
Black Point pool with Brandy...

394
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,044
...and suddenly I see Mom and some
douche bag walking into a house.

395
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,442
His house, I guess.

396
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,969
Just some guy, it
could be anybody.

397
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,645
No, he had his hand on her ass.

398
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,244
It was gross.

399
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,925
Then what? Then nothing.

400
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,486
Then they went into the house.

401
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,728
A few days later, I told her
I knew what she was doing.

402
00:28:52,763 --> 00:28:54,324
And?

403
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,244
And first, she acted like she had
no idea what I was talking about.

404
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,447
Like I'm fucking blind.

405
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,484
And then she got, like, super
mad and yelled and denied it.

406
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,166
That was when I decided that I didn't
want anything more to do with her.

407
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,805
Who is he?

408
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,411
I don't know, some guy.

409
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,166
What's he look like?

410
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,849
Dark hair.

411
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,131
Oh.

412
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,204
Watch your sister.

413
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,879
Hello?

414
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,522
Kai?

415
00:30:29,557 --> 00:30:31,164
Mark?

416
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,199
It's me, Matt.

417
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,599
No, it's not.

418
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,719
- I'm just saying you always wanna have...
- I'm not a mind reader.

419
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,085
Wait. Hello?

420
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,202
It's me, it's Matt.

421
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,762
- Oh, hey, Matt.
- Is this a bad time?

422
00:30:46,797 --> 00:30:48,250
Uh, no, no, we're just fighting.

423
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:50,999
Uh, come on in. You want coffee?
You want something to drink?

424
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,599
No, thanks.

425
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,171
- Fighting about something stupid.
- It's not stupid.

426
00:30:55,206 --> 00:30:56,364
It is stupid.

427
00:30:56,365 --> 00:30:58,010
He wants us to throw parties...

428
00:30:58,011 --> 00:31:01,399
...and have people over, which we do,
but who winds up doing the work?

429
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,345
You don't have to do anything.

430
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,290
- That's the whole point.
- I do.

431
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:08,759
It doesn't have to be work.
You don't have to clean and buy an outfit.

432
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,159
I'm supposed to be disgusting? Ugh.
And think up a goddamn theme cocktail.

433
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,839
We could just invite people over to
hang out and drink whatever we have.

434
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,119
Let's talk about it later.
Oh, shit, Matt, is everything okay?

435
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,525
Is there any news?

436
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,246
In fact, there is. I'll tell you
about it in a minute. Who is he?

437
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,923
Does she love him?

438
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,359
Who is he?

439
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,799
Matt...

440
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,169
I'm sorry to put you in that position, but I'm
not really the one who put you there, am I?

441
00:31:40,204 --> 00:31:43,642
I'd like to know who the guy
is that my wife was seeing.

442
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,439
You're angry. You have very
keen powers of observation.

443
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,159
You know what?
I think we should talk about this later.

444
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,205
You need to cool it.

445
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,528
Is it Troy?
That fucking Neanderthal.

446
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,246
You don't know him.

447
00:31:59,247 --> 00:32:02,879
Mark, don't you even. Shame on you.
You're supposed to be her friend.

448
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,959
Well, guess what.
I'm Matt's friend too, okay?

449
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,822
And this is a unique and dramatic
situation, and I would wanna know.

450
00:32:09,857 --> 00:32:13,685
Yeah, well, don't betray her when she's
not even here to defend herself.

451
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,768
Matt, look, you might not be
able to hear this right now...

452
00:32:20,803 --> 00:32:22,762
...but it's not her fault.

453
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,959
Your marriage was not...

454
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,759
Just... She was lonely.

455
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,679
So you're gonna talk to me
in clichés about women?

456
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,845
Nothing is ever a woman's fault.

457
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,724
Was it still going on when
she had the accident?

458
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,926
But I stayed out of it.

459
00:32:38,927 --> 00:32:41,685
Any time Kai would bring
it up, I would walk away.

460
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,566
You what?

461
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,360
Probably egged her on.

462
00:32:47,361 --> 00:32:50,359
Add a little drama in your
life without any actual risk.

463
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,921
Who do you think you're protecting, Kai?
She doesn't need your protection.

464
00:32:53,956 --> 00:32:56,048
It's over. She's gonna die.

465
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,926
Don't say that.

466
00:32:57,927 --> 00:32:59,968
It's true.
I was gonna tell you yesterday.

467
00:33:00,003 --> 00:33:01,325
She's never gonna wake up.

468
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:03,599
You hear me?
Do you understand what I'm saying?

469
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,845
She's gone.

470
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,090
We're pulling the plug.
You were putting lipstick on a corpse.

471
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,045
Come on, Matt.

472
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,242
That's a little intense.

473
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,809
Does she love him?

474
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,399
How can you ask about him
when she's gonna die?

475
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,644
Who cares? Yes, she loves him.
Loved him, whatever.

476
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:53,325
She was crazy about him.
She was gonna...

477
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,561
She was gonna ask
you for a divorce.

478
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,201
You still haven't
told me who he is.

479
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,803
I guess it doesn't matter.

480
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,811
Matt. Matt.

481
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,805
Brian Speer.

482
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,640
His name's Brian
Speer, with two E's.

483
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,199
They're just, like, cheap.

484
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,886
They're just like, "Get it
over with, cut corners. "

485
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:26,370
Hi, Daddy.

486
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:31,006
Dad, this is, uh, Sid.
Hello, Sid.

487
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,202
What's up, bro?

488
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,119
Don't ever do that to me again.

489
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,919
We're gonna see
your grandparents.

490
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,519
And, Scottie, Auntie Esther's
gonna come watch you.

491
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,799
Dad, Sid's coming with us, okay?

492
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,679
Yeah, listen, Sid, uh...

493
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,359
...what's going on this week is a
family matter, you understand?

494
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,170
Sid's not gonna be interested
in meeting your grandparents.

495
00:35:54,205 --> 00:35:55,525
He's gonna be bored stiff.

496
00:35:55,526 --> 00:35:58,083
Dad, I told you that he
was gonna be with me.

497
00:35:58,118 --> 00:36:00,641
I'll be a lot more
civil with him around.

498
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,608
What can I say?

499
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,485
It's like reading Korean.

500
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,285
Scott, if you want to, I
can walk you through it.

501
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,682
Jibber-jabber.

502
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,645
It's an advance directive.

503
00:36:25,646 --> 00:36:29,239
It's basically her instructions
on what procedures she wants.

504
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,639
In this case...
I know goddamn well what it says.

505
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,725
Says she doesn't want us sitting
around watching her spoil like milk.

506
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,971
Says if there's nothing the doctors can
do, she'd rather just get on with it.

507
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,159
Elizabeth had the good sense
to write this thing here.

508
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,839
She was always a thoughtful
girl, a strong girl.

509
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:54,279
Hell of a lot stronger than her brother.
Barry whines his way through life.

510
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,565
Might even be a homosexual,
for all I know.

511
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,968
Yeah, Scott, I don't think so.
And she's stronger than you, Matt.

512
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,119
She lived more in a year than
you lived in a decade...

513
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,799
...sitting in that office,
hoarding all your cash.

514
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,119
All that money you refuse to use.
What the hell good is it?

515
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:14,639
Now you and your family are getting ready
to cash in your chips. What the hell for?

516
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,679
Maybe if you let my baby
have her own boat...

517
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,319
...bought her safe equipment...

518
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,839
...maybe let her go on those
shopping sprees women like...

519
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,401
...maybe she wouldn't have gone
in for those thrill sports.

520
00:37:26,436 --> 00:37:29,609
Maybe if you'd provided
more thrills at home.

521
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,284
And you, Alexandra.

522
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,009
Putting your mother
through hell...

523
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:38,319
...when all she was trying to do was
instill sense and drive in you.

524
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,725
Shame on you. Shame on you.

525
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,001
You should try to
be more like her.

526
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,767
She was a good girl.

527
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,488
She was a good girl.

528
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,959
Hi, Alice. It's me, it's Matt.
It's good to see you.

529
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,639
Good to see you too. Hey, Tutu.

530
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,559
That's Alexandra.
That's your granddaughter.

531
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,999
That's your son-in-law, Matt.
This is your family.

532
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,999
Well, except for
that kid over there.

533
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,359
I don't know who the hell he is.
Who are you?

534
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,091
What are you doing here?
He's my friend.

535
00:39:02,126 --> 00:39:03,889
Good afternoon.

536
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:14,759
Alice, we're going to Queen's Hospital
this afternoon and see Elizabeth.

537
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,759
We are? Yes.

538
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,759
She needs us, just like
when she was a little girl.

539
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,119
We need to see her
in the hospital.

540
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,879
So think about what she might
wanna have in her room...

541
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,283
...and we'll take it to her
and put it next to her bed.

542
00:39:29,318 --> 00:39:31,806
Queen Elizabeth?

543
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,119
That's wonderful.

544
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,521
I have to put on a nice dress.

545
00:39:37,556 --> 00:39:40,729
Ha, ha. Is she serious?

546
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,039
Shut up, kid.

547
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,169
Ha, ha.
I've never met a queen before.

548
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,383
I'm sorry, man.
I was just laughing. It's funny.

549
00:39:53,418 --> 00:39:56,326
I mean, I think she knows
she's being funny.

550
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,043
I'm gonna hit you.

551
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,479
That was unreal.

552
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,802
I mean, how often do old
people just haul off...

553
00:40:07,837 --> 00:40:10,167
...and fucking coldcock
you like that?

554
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,321
He's hit me a couple of
times over the years.

555
00:40:13,356 --> 00:40:14,845
And watch your language.

556
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,420
Can I see it?

557
00:40:17,455 --> 00:40:19,521
Holy shit.

558
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,959
Hey, could you two just cool
it when you're around me?

559
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,479
Just stop touching each other?

560
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,725
Whoa, man.

561
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,162
Maybe that's why your wife cheated on
you, if you're so against touching.

562
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,368
You little fuck.
Do you get hit a lot?

563
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,691
I don't know. I've had my share.

564
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,447
Your friend is completely
retarded, you know that?

565
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,365
Hey, man, my little
brother's retarded.

566
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,165
Don't use that word in
a derogatory fashion.

567
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,851
Oh.

568
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,801
Psych. I don't have a retarded brother.
Sid, you suck.

569
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,759
Speaking of retarded, do you
ever wish that, like...

570
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,079
...retarded people or old
people would just hurry up?

571
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,959
Like sometimes I'm waiting for
them to cross the street...

572
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,725
...and I'm like,
"Come on, already. "

573
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,688
But then I feel bad.

574
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,225
Dad?

575
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,771
What?

576
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,525
Don't forget that I
know where he lives.

577
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,444
Get in the front seat.

578
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,441
So you don't know anything
else about him...

579
00:41:46,442 --> 00:41:49,399
...like what he does or if
he's married or anything?

580
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,085
Just his name. Brian Speer.

581
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,610
Why didn't you ask Kai and Mark?

582
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,009
- I just didn't.
- Why not?

583
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:01,519
I didn't wanna get into it, that's all.
We'll Google him later.

584
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,119
All right. Um...

585
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,839
We're almost...
That's it, that's it, that's the one.

586
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,524
Stop. The one with the turtle.

587
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,329
That one? Yeah, yeah.

588
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,925
There? He lives there?

589
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,281
I can't say for sure
that he lives there...

590
00:42:20,282 --> 00:42:22,248
...but that's where I saw them.

591
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,239
Should I ring the bell?

592
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:30,239
No. This is stupid.
This is stalking or something. I...

593
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,359
Okay, it's... We came, we saw.
That's enough. Let's go.

594
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,806
Well, it's not like we're
stalking him exactly.

595
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,802
What would you do if
you saw him, anyway?

596
00:42:51,837 --> 00:42:53,484
Talk to him? Punch him? What?

597
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,128
I guess I just wanna see him.

598
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,531
- Dad, Dad, stop, stop, stop.
- What, what?

599
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:24,363
Go back, go back.

600
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,241
- What?
- Just go back.

601
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,605
What?

602
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,041
Look, there he is.

603
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,840
At least now we know
what he looks like.

604
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,839
<i>Hi, this is Brian Speer
of Gold Coast Realty.</i>

605
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,439
<i>Sorry I missed your call.</i>

606
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,683
<i>Leave a message with your name,
number, and time that you called...</i>

607
00:44:12,718 --> 00:44:16,685
<i>...and I'll get back to you
just as soon as I can. Mahalo.</i>

608
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,799
Hi, Brian.

609
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,519
My name's Herb Fitzmorris...

610
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,763
...and I'm interested in your
house on Koloa Street...

611
00:44:24,798 --> 00:44:27,923
...the one with the
cool fence and gate.

612
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,207
I'm at 645-2796.

613
00:44:32,242 --> 00:44:33,690
Thank you.

614
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,565
Girls, let me go in for just
a quick moment alone first

615
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,244
I'll be right out.

616
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,449
You were gonna ask
for a divorce...

617
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:42,081
...so you could be with some
fucking fuckhead, Brian Speer?

618
00:45:42,116 --> 00:45:43,650
Are you kidding me?

619
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,849
Who are you?

620
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,609
The only thing I know for sure
is you're a goddamn liar.

621
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,247
So, what do you have
to say for yourself?

622
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,439
Why don't you go ahead and
make a little joke...

623
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,439
...and tell me that
I got it all wrong?

624
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,286
Tell me again that I'm too out
of touch with my feelings...

625
00:46:05,321 --> 00:46:07,851
...and I need to go to therapy.

626
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,289
Isn't the idea of marriage to make your
partner's way in life a little easier?

627
00:46:13,324 --> 00:46:18,810
For me, it was always harder with you,
and you're still making it harder.

628
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,882
Lying there on a ventilator
and fucking up my life.

629
00:46:22,917 --> 00:46:25,565
You are relentless.

630
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,690
You know what? I was gonna ask
you for a divorce someday.

631
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,728
Daddy's little girl.

632
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,649
I'm gonna bring your
daughters in now.

633
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,251
Alex is home from school.
Try to be nice, okay?

634
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,449
All right, here we go.

635
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,922
Okay? Hi, Mom. Look who's here.

636
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,559
Say something, Alex.

637
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,885
Tell her how you were
drunk the other night.

638
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,481
- Tell her how maybe you're an alcoholic.
- Girls, be serious.

639
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,690
Hi, Mom.

640
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,287
Sorry for being bad.

641
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,879
Sorry for wasting your money
on expensive private schools.

642
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,719
Money you could have been using
on facials and massages...

643
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,885
...and sports equipment.

644
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,604
Sorry for everything. All right.

645
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,239
I'm sorry we weren't good
enough for you, especially Dad.

646
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,239
Stop it. That's out of line.
Or what? You gonna ground me?

647
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,119
Ship me off to another boarding school?
Give me a time-out?

648
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,645
I'll tell you what, goddamn it.

649
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,442
You got served Scottie,
go in the hall.

650
00:48:10,477 --> 00:48:11,965
She's the one out of line.

651
00:48:11,966 --> 00:48:14,005
Go find Sid. He's smoking.

652
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:18,329
I shouldn't be around second-hand smoke.
Go, let's go. Now, now, now, go.

653
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,799
Did you spank me?
You have no right to talk to her that way.

654
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,359
She's gonna die.
What if those were your last words?

655
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,399
I have every right to speak to her that way.
I'm angry at her.

656
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,919
How can you be so forgiving?
I'll be angry later.

657
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:35,005
Let's just think about the good parts.
Don't say that stuff in front of your sister.

658
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,446
Don't spoil her for Scottie.

659
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,368
Say something different.

660
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:54,366
Look, Mom, I know
that we fought a lot.

661
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,685
I just...
I always wanted to be like you.

662
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:02,410
I am like you.
I'm exactly like you.

663
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,081
You are like her.
Mostly in good ways.

664
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:12,762
Maybe some bad ways.
Remains to be seen.

665
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,243
Yeah.

666
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,039
Dad, this is Reina.
Reina, this is my sister and Sid.

667
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,169
And that's my mom on the bed.
Hi, everybody.

668
00:49:32,204 --> 00:49:34,640
Hello. Hi.

669
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,170
So this is your mother?

670
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,079
I guess it's true.

671
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,679
Should I shake her hand?

672
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,085
If you want. No, thanks.

673
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,170
So, uh, Reina, I understand that
your grandmother's not feeling well?

674
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,079
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

675
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,919
She got her stomach
operated on...

676
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,810
...and then got some sort of
stupid infection or something.

677
00:50:00,845 --> 00:50:02,086
It's pretty gross.

678
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,639
Hmm. Well, Reina, thank
you for stopping by.

679
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:09,199
Scottie, let me give you some money,
and you two can get some ice cream.

680
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,759
Too many carbs.

681
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,805
Too many carbs?

682
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,084
Well, you could go down to the
cafeteria and get some lettuce.

683
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:22,439
That's okay. I'm done.
You weren't a liar after all.

684
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,764
Don't you wanna hang out?
No, I should go. See you at the club.

685
00:50:26,799 --> 00:50:30,481
Hope your mom gets better.
Bye, everybody.

686
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,119
Scottie, what did she mean by
"You aren't a liar after all"?

687
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:40,319
What did she think you were lying about?
She didn't believe Mom was sleeping.

688
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,062
So you had to prove to that
twat that Mom's in a coma?

689
00:50:43,097 --> 00:50:45,804
What the fuck is in your skull?
A bunch of stupid pills?

690
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,279
Shut up, you motherless whore.

691
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,445
Whoa, whoa.

692
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,131
Easy there, half-pipe.
Where'd you learn to talk like that?

693
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,326
Hello?

694
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:17,639
No, this is the right number.
No, no, I'm his assistant, Sharon.

695
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,166
- How may I help you?
- Who is it?

696
00:51:20,201 --> 00:51:22,162
Uh-huh.

697
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,686
Oh.

698
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,084
All right. All right, so one or the other?
Okay, I'll tell him. Mahalo.

699
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,919
That was Bonnie
Tanaka, a realtor.

700
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,199
She says that Mr. Speer is going to
be on Kauai for the next week...

701
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,742
...but she'd be happy to
show you the house...

702
00:51:39,777 --> 00:51:42,285
...or you can stop by the
open house on Sunday.

703
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,639
Hi, Mr. King.

704
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:18,663
Hello, Buzz.
Sorry about Mrs. King.

705
00:52:18,698 --> 00:52:21,687
Hope she gets better real soon.
Thanks.

706
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,685
It really blows.

707
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,970
I know.

708
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,928
<i>You've all asked questions about Elizabeth,
and I've given vague answers.</i>

709
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,364
But I asked you all here
today to tell you...

710
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,210
...that her coma is permanent.

711
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,843
She's not gonna make it.

712
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:49,170
So this week,
tomorrow, in fact...

713
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,240
...as per her wishes...

714
00:52:51,241 --> 00:52:54,084
...we are going to unhook
her from life support.

715
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:02,844
You all know Elizabeth.
She has to do everything on her own.

716
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,286
I wanted to tell you
all in person...

717
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,719
...because you are all
our dear friends.

718
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,959
You're our best friends.

719
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,328
The girls and I so much appreciate
everything you have done for us...

720
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:21,448
...in the last few weeks.

721
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,009
Bringing food and calling.

722
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,879
Can we go see her? Yes.
Yes, for God's sakes, yes.

723
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,125
That's the whole point.
Go see her as soon as possible.

724
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:38,963
That's what I wanna tell you. All of you.
It should be now, not after.

725
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,805
<i>Everyone who loves Elizabeth
deserves a chance to say goodbye.</i>

726
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,968
<i>You've lost your mind.</i>

727
00:54:16,969 --> 00:54:19,850
You mean him?
Tell him to come say goodbye?

728
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,931
I'll be gone a day or so.

729
00:54:21,932 --> 00:54:24,639
I'll leave in the morning,
I'll be back tomorrow night.

730
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,159
If it takes another day, fine.

731
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,209
I'll give it two days.
If I don't find him, at least I tried.

732
00:54:29,244 --> 00:54:30,361
Just drop it, Dad.

733
00:54:30,362 --> 00:54:35,207
You've got way bigger fish to fry
than confronting fucking Brian Speer.

734
00:54:35,242 --> 00:54:36,361
You're recording this?

735
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:42,367
I'm summarizing a deposition.
How can you work at a time like this?

736
00:54:42,402 --> 00:54:45,603
How can you go to a movie?
To get Scottie out of the house.

737
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,725
And you actually wanna tell
him to come back and see Mom?

738
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,725
I think...

739
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,765
I just think she'd
want him to know.

740
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,361
Just call his office and
tell him it's an emergency.

741
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,045
No. On the phone, he can escape.

742
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,971
In person, he's got nowhere to go.
I wanna see his face.

743
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,970
I wanna go too.

744
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,888
No, you're gonna stay here with Scottie.
Fuck that. Let's all get out of town.

745
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,847
Yo, Matt King.

746
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,599
Hey, Ralph. Hey.

747
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:51,559
Yeah, how's it? Great to see you. Good.
You remember your cousin Ralph.

748
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,679
Yeah. Hey. Good to see you.
Oh, yeah, hi.

749
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,399
What you guys doing here?
Came over for a day or two.

750
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,365
I just got back from Kaho'olawe.
Yeah?

751
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,085
Business over there.
So you here to talk to the cousins?

752
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,288
Make sure everybody's
happy with your choice?

753
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,806
Pay your respects to Hugh?

754
00:56:04,807 --> 00:56:07,439
<i>No, just a little holoholo,
get the kids out of town.</i>

755
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,359
But it is Holitzer, right?
We all know it's Holitzer.

756
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,362
Cousin Hugh wants him.
They go way back.

757
00:56:12,397 --> 00:56:13,964
I got my misgivings,
though, Matt.

758
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,359
There's an argument to
be made to max it out.

759
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,781
We only do this once in a lifetime.
I wanna work with you guys, I do.

760
00:56:19,816 --> 00:56:23,203
Whatever the majority decides after
the poll, I'll go along with it.

761
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,287
Let's just get it
over with, you know?

762
00:56:25,288 --> 00:56:26,520
All right. Okay.

763
00:56:26,521 --> 00:56:28,559
How's Elizabeth doing?
She gonna be okay?

764
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,119
The same.
Well, she's a tough gal, Matt.

765
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:33,399
She'll be okay, yeah? Yeah.

766
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,799
Where are you guys going?
Hanalei? Princeville.

767
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,399
Come on, I'll give you a ride.

768
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,565
Yeah? Yeah.

769
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,409
- Come on, kids.
- Where are we going?

770
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:42,880
Cousin Ralph's gonna
give us a ride.

771
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,767
Hey, Ralph. Yeah?

772
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:06,409
Turn off over here. Let's go see the land.
Take a last look, huh?

773
00:57:06,444 --> 00:57:09,768
You got time?
I got nothing but time.

774
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:33,479
I think this is where the
golf course is gonna go.

775
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,881
They want the golf course
to rival Pebble Beach.

776
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:37,484
You know, bring in the big boys.

777
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,168
Scottie. Come on, sweetheart.

778
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,609
- Careful, Scottie.
- I got it.

779
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,450
Look.

780
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:35,402
Sometimes if you look out at
the coast, you can see whales.

781
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,440
Are you shitting me?

782
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,449
You guys own all this land?
Not personally. It belongs to a trust.

783
00:58:44,484 --> 00:58:46,568
But, yeah, it's ours
for a few more days.

784
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:51,125
Big resort there on that point.
Commercial area there.

785
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,963
Houses all through there.

786
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,051
Part of me agrees with the
cousins that don't wanna sell.

787
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,279
They're gonna make a
stink at the meeting.

788
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,079
Yeah, but we have to.
The trust dissolves in seven years.

789
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,839
If we don't sell, it's just
gonna be a train wreck.

790
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,159
But it's a shame, yeah? Yeah.

791
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,561
On the other hand, hey,
it's just sitting there.

792
00:59:08,596 --> 00:59:09,766
No one's using it.

793
00:59:09,767 --> 00:59:12,570
This way the whole world
will be able to enjoy it.

794
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,319
Take a good look, girls.

795
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:19,519
This is part of your great-great-
great-grandmother's inheritance...

796
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,543
...going all the way
back to Kamehameha I.

797
00:59:22,578 --> 00:59:25,567
Down there is where
Mom and I would camp.

798
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,642
We all did, all our lives.

799
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,242
Lots of memories.

800
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,567
Everything has its time.

801
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,851
What about me? I wanna camp.

802
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,845
I'm supposed to be meeting
a friend of mine.

803
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:40,684
I think he's staying here.
Uh, his name is Brian Speer. S-P-E-E-R.

804
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,850
I'm sorry, Mr. King.
I'm not shown anybody by that name.

805
01:00:46,885 --> 01:00:48,842
Okay, thanks.

806
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,079
Hey, Scottie.

807
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:03,479
What's in your suit?
They're my beach boobs.

808
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,079
Take them out of there right now.
Jesus, Alex.

809
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,205
Why would you let her do that?
You too, Sid.

810
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:13,406
I don't know. Take them out, stupid.
Yeah, Scottie. Big boobs look kind of fatty.

811
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,079
Any luck?

812
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:26,359
Well, the hotels were a dead end, but
I took another shot with his office.

813
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,204
He's definitely renting
a house in Hanalei.

814
01:01:29,239 --> 01:01:32,048
Probably one of the
cottages around the bay.

815
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,407
I think we should go for a walk.

816
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:39,768
Yeah, let's go. Scottie!

817
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,724
Can we swim with the sharks?

818
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:52,599
I read in the hotel magazine how they,
like, put you in a cage underwater...

819
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:56,764
...and then you throw shark feed around,
and then the sharks swim right up to you.

820
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:57,966
Can we do that?

821
01:01:57,967 --> 01:02:01,159
Scottie, we're not really
here to do stuff like that.

822
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,445
SCOTTIE Oh.

823
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,801
Well, what are we
here to do, then?

824
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,409
How did you and Mom meet?

825
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:24,479
I was with a law-school buddy
of mine from the mainland.

826
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,879
We were just coming in from paddling,
and your mom was on her way out.

827
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,839
And she looked at
me and she said:

828
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,479
"Do you think it's
gonna snow today?"

829
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,846
- Did you think she was pretty?
- Oh, she knocked me out.

830
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,650
I like her stories, like how
she streaked at the wedding.

831
01:02:43,685 --> 01:02:45,847
Oh, my God.
There's so many like that.

832
01:02:45,848 --> 01:02:48,923
And the time she beat a wild
pig with a shoe. Ha, ha.

833
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,639
Your mom got chased
by a shark once.

834
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,199
What? When was that?

835
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,522
We were with Mark and Kai, and
your mom was out surfing...

836
01:02:56,557 --> 01:02:59,808
...and she saw a shark right
beneath her on a wave.

837
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,969
Let's watch one of these.
No, we are not watching porn.

838
01:03:21,004 --> 01:03:23,042
Give me... No.

839
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,364
Reina's dad watches porn.

840
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,479
Reina calls them
masturbation movies.

841
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,239
She plays them when her parents aren't
home, and one time invited boys over...

842
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,479
...to see if they
grew down there.

843
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,159
One did. Reina sounds awesome.

844
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,719
Were you there?
Did you watch one of those movies?

845
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,725
No. Hey, Scottie.

846
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,684
Reina's a fucked-up ho-bag, and
you need to stay away from her.

847
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:51,006
And she's going to be a methhead and
she's gonna get used by stupid guys.

848
01:03:51,041 --> 01:03:53,048
She's a twat. Say it.

849
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,766
She's a twat.

850
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:59,246
- All right. Okay. All right, okay. Stop it.
- She's a twat, twat, twat.

851
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,239
I don't get it.
I don't know what to do.

852
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,679
These things she does,
what goes on in her head.

853
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,839
You weren't like that.

854
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,599
It'll go away. I'm not so sure.

855
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,807
Look at the way you kids
talk in front of me.

856
01:04:14,842 --> 01:04:16,928
It's like you don't
respect authority.

857
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,245
Hey.

858
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:59,445
Hi. Coming to check
on me or something?

859
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:04,281
I've been having trouble sleeping lately.
Understandable.

860
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,605
I'm worried about my daughters.

861
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,007
I think there's something
wrong with them.

862
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:29,639
I mean, I used to do a bunch of
messed-up shit when I was a kid.

863
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,765
Still do.

864
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,280
It's gonna get worse
after your wife dies.

865
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,999
What's Alex think about
all this stuff going on?

866
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,559
What's she say? She doesn't.

867
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:44,399
What do you mean?
I thought she talks to you all the time.

868
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,799
We don't really talk
about our issues.

869
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,406
We deal with our shit by
talking about other stuff...

870
01:05:49,441 --> 01:05:50,890
...and having a good time.

871
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:03,679
What would you do if you were me?
How would you handle my daughters?

872
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:06,968
How would you handle the situation
of this guy we're trying to find?

873
01:06:07,003 --> 01:06:08,166
I told you, man.

874
01:06:08,167 --> 01:06:11,960
I'd put his nuts on a dresser and
I'd beat them with a spiked bat.

875
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:17,559
As for your daughters, I don't know.
Exchange them for sons, I guess.

876
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:20,839
Well, I'd probably end up
with something like you.

877
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,079
I'm not so bad. I'm smart.

878
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,719
You are about a hundred
miles from Smartville.

879
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:29,959
No offense.
You are mistaken, counselor.

880
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:33,407
I'm smart and, you know,
I have good hygiene.

881
01:06:33,442 --> 01:06:35,050
I'm a decent guitar player.

882
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:39,079
I'm a good cook.
I mean, I cook food all the time.

883
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:42,607
I'm vice president of
the Punahou chess club.

884
01:06:42,642 --> 01:06:44,728
And I always have weed.

885
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,569
Your mother must be very proud.

886
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:53,239
It's possible.
I mean, she's been kind of busy lately.

887
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:57,999
Yeah, what's she do, your mom?
She's a receptionist at a pet clinic.

888
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,130
But lately she's been getting the
house together after my dad died.

889
01:07:02,165 --> 01:07:04,441
My dad died a few months ago.

890
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:12,399
November 24th. Drunk driver.

891
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,564
Actually, uh, both
drivers were drunk.

892
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:18,130
Yeah.

893
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,424
Good night, Sid.

894
01:07:34,459 --> 01:07:36,608
Night, boss.

895
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:43,486
I will see you in the morning.

896
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:41,162
Stay in the zone. That means you, Skylar.
You too, Colt.

897
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,491
Keep an eye on your sister.
I'll be right back.

898
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,806
Looks like you got your
hands full with those two.

899
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,679
Yeah.

900
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,359
Yeah. Must keep you pretty busy.

901
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:17,439
They're pretty nonstop, but
they're at a really fun age.

902
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,639
How old are they? Eight and 10.

903
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:24,165
I've got two girls, 10 and 17.

904
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,521
That whole nonstop thing,
that never changes.

905
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,567
Do you guys live here? On Oahu.

906
01:11:30,602 --> 01:11:32,324
Oh, so do we.

907
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,359
Hurry up.

908
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:38,199
I thought I'd get the girls out
of town for a couple days.

909
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:41,283
Their mother's in the hospital.
I thought I'd give them a break.

910
01:11:41,318 --> 01:11:42,884
Oh, no.

911
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,722
What's wrong, if you
don't mind my asking?

912
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:49,886
She was in a boating accident.
She hit her head a little too hard.

913
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,166
Sailboat or one with a motor?

914
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,003
One with a motor.

915
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:03,209
Good luck with that.
I wish her well.

916
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:05,848
Not so far, Skylar!

917
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,241
So are you guys staying in
one of the cottages here?

918
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,399
Yeah. My husband had
to come for work...

919
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:18,239
...so we thought we'd make
a little vacation of it.

920
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,464
We know the owner, so...
Hugh King.

921
01:12:20,499 --> 01:12:22,689
That's right.
Yeah, he's my cousin.

922
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,523
Oh. You probably know my
husband, then, Brian Speer?

923
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,328
No, I can't say I do.

924
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,127
Oh, I just assumed. He's been...

925
01:12:35,162 --> 01:12:38,249
Dad? Something bit me.

926
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,724
It was nice talking to you.

927
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,441
You too. Take care.

928
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:36,130
There's Cousin Hugh.
Grab that table and order me something.

929
01:13:36,165 --> 01:13:38,248
What do you want? Anything.

930
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,759
Ha, ha. Hey, Hugh.

931
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:49,639
Hey, Mattie boy.

932
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:52,879
What you doing here?
I didn't expect to see you until the meeting.

933
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,919
I know. I'm getting the girls out of
the hospital for a couple of days.

934
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,359
Oh. Is that, uh...?
It's Scottie and Alex.

935
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,679
Oh. Big girls now. Yeah.

936
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,759
We just needed a little
change of scenery.

937
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,439
What you've been going through,
that's a tough deal.

938
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,639
Yeah.

939
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,639
But Elizabeth, hey, tough
gal, I'll tell you that.

940
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:13,919
A fighter. She's gonna make it.
Get you a drink?

941
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,279
I'll have whatever you're having.
Julia.

942
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,559
Hey.
Old-fashioned for my coz here.

943
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:19,879
All right. Thanks.

944
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:23,359
Ha, ha. Nice to see you, man.
You too.

945
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,163
How you been otherwise?

946
01:14:25,198 --> 01:14:26,966
Not much otherwise.

947
01:14:26,967 --> 01:14:30,559
Between business and the hospital, I'm
trying to keep my head above water.

948
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:31,759
Yeah. Yeah.

949
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:35,479
Listen, I see that you have some
people staying at the cottage.

950
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:38,959
Mattie, if I'd known you were coming,
I could've moved those people out.

951
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:42,646
Not that at all. It's just, I was wondering
about the guy you're renting to.

952
01:14:42,681 --> 01:14:44,847
I think his name is Brian Speer?

953
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:48,529
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Real determined son of a bitch.

954
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:53,645
He's Lou's sister's... Uh, no, no, wait.
Uh, Lou has a sister.

955
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:58,891
The sister's husband, uh, Lou's
brother-in-law, is cousins with that guy.

956
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,799
Yeah, who's Lou?
No, no, wait, wait.

957
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:06,559
You mean the cottages on the bay
or the cottage back by the trail?

958
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:09,239
The bay. The guy with the
wife and the two sons.

959
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:13,159
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, determined son of a bitch.

960
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,879
The point is, the guy that
we're doing business with...

961
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:18,599
...is that guy's
brother-in-law, works for him.

962
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:23,839
What guy we're doing business with?
Who do you think? Don.

963
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:26,439
Ha, ha. Who else? Holitzer.

964
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:28,759
Holitzer?
That's what I'm saying.

965
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:32,439
That's Don's brother-in-law
in the cottage.

966
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,319
Brian Speer? You don't know him?

967
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,159
I thought you'd know him.
He's a realtor out by you.

968
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:40,239
So if we sell to Don...
Which we're gonna do, right?

969
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:44,039
I mean, that's what you want too.
Nice guy, Don. He'll do right by us.

970
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:49,279
So then when Don develops,
resells, leases and all that...

971
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:53,679
...he's letting this brother-in-law handle
the transactions, a lot of them anyway.

972
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:55,999
Big score for that guy.

973
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:08,879
And sitting in with us this afternoon,
we are fortunate to have our nephew.

974
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:13,919
This is Keola, and, uh...
Hey, Hugh, what's he like?

975
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,919
Who? Brian Speer.

976
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:20,285
What else you know about him?
Well, not much. He's lucky.

977
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:24,325
That son of a bitch is gonna make a
shitload of money on commissions.

978
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,841
Not if we don't
go with that bid.

979
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,358
We all want Don.

980
01:16:32,359 --> 01:16:33,723
<i>This is the way.</i>

981
01:16:33,724 --> 01:16:35,609
You do too, Mattie.
You said as much.

982
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,682
No, I understand.

983
01:16:42,717 --> 01:16:44,524
You're right.

984
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,325
<i>I went down to Texas</i>

985
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,646
Hugh, it's good to see you.

986
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,359
You too. All right. Okay.

987
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,170
I'll see you at the meeting.
I'll be there.

988
01:16:57,205 --> 01:16:58,969
<i>This is the way</i>

989
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:10,119
<i>I'm just a Hawaiian cowboy.</i>

990
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:14,279
<i>Riding on the range every night.</i>

991
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:18,445
<i>The women are thicker
than cactus.</i>

992
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,927
<i>And I swear I'll never
ride this range again</i>

993
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:29,200
This place rocks. Totally.

994
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,684
Oh, we ordered you mahi.

995
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,090
Great.

996
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,679
So guess what. That woman at the
beach today, that was his wife.

997
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,279
Whose wife? Brian Speer.

998
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,999
What? The hottie with the hat?
Yeah.

999
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,439
Are you sure? Yeah.

1000
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,805
So he's married?

1001
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,330
Why didn't you say anything?

1002
01:18:16,331 --> 01:18:19,719
It's him I wanna talk to, not her.
But I know where their cottage is.

1003
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:22,451
You do? Let's do it right now.
Let's knock on his door.

1004
01:18:22,486 --> 01:18:24,408
That's what I'm saying.

1005
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,399
Don't do that, don't be excited.
This isn't fun.

1006
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:31,199
It's what we came here to do.
Right.

1007
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,439
So you talk to his wife
while I talk to him.

1008
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:37,081
And you figure out a way to
distract Scottie and their kids.

1009
01:18:37,116 --> 01:18:38,923
Got it. Sid, come here.

1010
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:43,489
- Give him hell, boss.
- Come on, Sid.

1011
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:45,965
Okay.

1012
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:59,519
I'm sorry for sucking you into this.
I should be doing it alone.

1013
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,841
It's selfish.
I'm the one who sucked you in.

1014
01:19:01,876 --> 01:19:03,649
I'm the one who knew.

1015
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:09,526
Oh.

1016
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:12,688
Don't be a pussy.

1017
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,167
Hi there.

1018
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,519
It's the guy from
the beach today.

1019
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,679
Oh, hello. Hi, yeah.

1020
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:24,999
You know, I'm such an idiot.
I just figured out, I do know your husband.

1021
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,599
My daughter and I were on
our way back from dinner...

1022
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,251
...and we just thought we'd
stop by and say howdy.

1023
01:19:30,286 --> 01:19:32,208
<i>Howdy? Great, come on up.</i>

1024
01:19:32,209 --> 01:19:36,839
Yeah. I'm Matt King,
and this is Alexandra.

1025
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,359
Hi.

1026
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:41,919
Yeah, I thought that was you.
You've been in the paper so much lately.

1027
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,799
I figured you had to know Brian.
He's been pretty involved.

1028
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,399
Yeah, no, super involved.

1029
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,640
Yeah, maybe we met in passing.
I don't know.

1030
01:19:48,675 --> 01:19:50,881
I guess you guys are
deciding really soon?

1031
01:19:50,882 --> 01:19:53,358
In the next couple of days, right,
you and your family meet?

1032
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:54,598
Mm. Sorry.

1033
01:19:54,599 --> 01:19:56,329
That's probably a
conflict of interest.

1034
01:19:56,330 --> 01:20:01,247
No, that's okay. You're right.
It's all gonna be over in a couple of days.

1035
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:05,039
Do you guys want some lasagna?
No, thanks, we just ate.

1036
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,125
Sure.

1037
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:08,685
- Red wine, iced tea?
- Perfect.

1038
01:20:08,686 --> 01:20:10,279
Hi.

1039
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,319
Hey. Hey.

1040
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:16,399
Hi, I'm Brian. Brian.
We may have met before.

1041
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,999
Matt King.
My wife is Elizabeth King.

1042
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,399
I think you may
have met her too.

1043
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,399
This is our daughter Alexandra.

1044
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:26,399
I was just gonna get
them some drinks.

1045
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,125
Good, good, good.

1046
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,925
- Do you want some help?
- No, no, no, I got it.

1047
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,885
Hi.

1048
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:36,048
Elizabeth is dying.

1049
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:40,845
Oh, wait. Fuck you.
And she's dying.

1050
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:44,930
We unhooked her from the machines this morning.
She'll be dead in a few days.

1051
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,245
This is him? Mm-hm.

1052
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:53,922
Why would she go for him? Beats me.
Well, he's very articulate.

1053
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:58,120
I'm sorry. I never thought
it would come to this.

1054
01:20:58,121 --> 01:21:01,203
You're sorry that my mom's gonna die?
Sorry that you fucked her?

1055
01:21:01,238 --> 01:21:02,770
You sorry you
fucked over my dad?

1056
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,959
I'm sorry for all of it.
Look, I'm not here to wreck your life.

1057
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,559
I just wanna give you a
chance to go to the hospital.

1058
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:13,201
Don't know how long you're staying, but
you could find an excuse to leave.

1059
01:21:13,236 --> 01:21:14,611
You must be good at that.

1060
01:21:14,612 --> 01:21:17,251
You could be alone with her
to say goodbye or whatever.

1061
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:19,919
You hear what I'm saying?

1062
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,288
Okay, look, I can't have you here.
Do you understand that?

1063
01:21:23,323 --> 01:21:25,521
Here we go. Hey.

1064
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:30,279
Thank you.
Everyone's so serious.

1065
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,799
Please tell me you weren't
talking about business.

1066
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,279
- Ha, ha. Ah, we were talking about love.
- That's nice.

1067
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:38,399
Will you call the boys in?
Dinner's ready.

1068
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:41,159
Oh, they're fine.
Let them play a while longer.

1069
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:45,559
- Come on. Catch.
- Hurry up. Catch it.

1070
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:48,199
Awesome cottage you're renting.
Yeah, you don't say.

1071
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,959
This is prime Hanalei location.

1072
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:53,479
I used to come here when I was a kid,
before it was a vacation property.

1073
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:58,479
Alex, your great-uncle Warren and Aunt
Lillian built this back in the '20s.

1074
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,679
I haven't been inside in years.
Come on, we'll give you a tour.

1075
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,684
Maybe, Brian, you could give my
dad a walk down memory lane...

1076
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:06,603
...and Julie and I
can chat out here.

1077
01:22:06,604 --> 01:22:09,604
Oh, yeah, I'd like that, if you don't mind.
Just a quick look.

1078
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,159
Yeah.

1079
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:16,119
Yes. It's not like we live
here or anything, but okay.

1080
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:17,439
Ah.

1081
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,761
Will you hold that for me? Mm.

1082
01:22:19,796 --> 01:22:21,125
Let's go over here.

1083
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,930
- Have you guys traveled much?
- Not much.

1084
01:22:28,965 --> 01:22:30,160
We kind of just stay...

1085
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,679
...in the area of the islands...
Here it is.

1086
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,799
How'd you meet? I'm curious.

1087
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,999
I can't do this. Neither can I.
How'd you meet?

1088
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,810
I thought you said you
came here just to tell me.

1089
01:22:42,845 --> 01:22:44,006
I changed my mind.

1090
01:22:44,007 --> 01:22:47,083
And I can't very well ask
her the details, can I?

1091
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,609
How'd you meet?

1092
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:53,400
At What party? a party.

1093
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:55,561
A Super Bowl party.

1094
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,399
At the Mitchell's.

1095
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,839
Does that help? Does that make it better?
I'm doing you a favor here.

1096
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:05,571
I could go out there right
now and I could fuck you up.

1097
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:07,483
So get a better attitude.

1098
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:12,081
And then what?
How'd you get the nerve to ask her out?

1099
01:23:12,116 --> 01:23:13,241
Was it about the deal?

1100
01:23:13,242 --> 01:23:16,839
Is that when you decided she was for you?
No. It's not what you think.

1101
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,239
It just happened.

1102
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:21,399
Nothing just happens.
Everything just happens.

1103
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:24,599
Ha, ha. Was she gonna leave me?

1104
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,079
She would have.
But I didn't want that.

1105
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,919
That never would've happened.
I love Julie.

1106
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,924
<i>I know I'll cry, I know he'll
leave I know he'll lie.</i>

1107
01:23:32,959 --> 01:23:34,763
Please don't tell her.

1108
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:36,805
Please.

1109
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:40,561
I don't know what I have
done, but I am so sorry.

1110
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,288
Did she say that she loved you?

1111
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:49,679
<i>Flyin' into window panes.</i>

1112
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:54,208
<i>Changin' lanes And
it's all in vain.</i>

1113
01:23:54,243 --> 01:23:56,089
Do you love her?

1114
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,239
You don't love her.

1115
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,479
You don't love her.
You were just using her to get to me.

1116
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:11,359
I told you, I wasn't
trying to get to you.

1117
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:14,759
It was an affair, an attraction.
It was sex.

1118
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:17,879
She got carried away with the
whole thing, and I went with it.

1119
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:20,611
At least, I didn't say no to
things that I should have.

1120
01:24:20,646 --> 01:24:22,170
I love my family.

1121
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:24,239
I guess it's all working out.

1122
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:28,159
Her lips are sealed, and you don't have
to go through the trouble of dumping her.

1123
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:29,479
Hey, that is so unfair.

1124
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:35,279
I had... I have so much respect for her.
She's an amazing woman.

1125
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,885
<i>It just ain't fair</i>

1126
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:38,843
I have one more
question for you.

1127
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,325
Yeah?

1128
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,161
You ever been inside my bedroom?

1129
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:51,640
Once.

1130
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:56,483
Oh. Wow.

1131
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,645
You could've had the decency
to lie about that one.

1132
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,364
All right, twice.

1133
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:07,839
<i>Fools my eye Every time.</i>

1134
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:11,322
She's at Queen's Hospital
if you wanna say goodbye.

1135
01:25:11,357 --> 01:25:13,846
That is really all I
came here to say.

1136
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:22,519
That's great.
All remodeled and new appliances. Nice.

1137
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,679
Alex, I think we
should get going.

1138
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:28,199
Well, hey, thanks for stopping by.
It was really nice to meet you both.

1139
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,965
Maybe I'll see you at the beach tomorrow.
Yeah, maybe.

1140
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,122
Nice to meet you. You too.

1141
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,519
Hey.

1142
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:00,919
When do you think he'll show up?

1143
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,479
I have no idea.

1144
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:06,079
Was he sorry?
I hope he was sorry, man.

1145
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,679
I mean, you could've told
his wife, and you didn't.

1146
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:10,279
I would've told her everything.

1147
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:12,601
I mean, that guy doesn't
know how lucky he is.

1148
01:26:12,636 --> 01:26:14,090
She deserves to know too.

1149
01:26:14,091 --> 01:26:17,159
Otherwise she's just gonna be a
dumb bitch the rest of her life.

1150
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:20,079
Sid. I'm just saying.

1151
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,799
No need to get creepy about it.

1152
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,639
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
It's all behind us.

1153
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:30,239
Yeah, well, the one we have to worry
about telling things to now is Scottie.

1154
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:31,765
Yeah.

1155
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:36,089
I asked Dr. Johnston to help me
break the news to her tomorrow.

1156
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:14,983
Dr. Johnston asked me to
come here to meet you today.

1157
01:27:15,018 --> 01:27:18,566
And I've heard so many
wonderful things about you.

1158
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:27,370
Your mother is going
to die very soon.

1159
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:37,327
Here we are.

1160
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:40,885
Hey.

1161
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,888
Hi, Barry. Hey.

1162
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:46,885
Hey. Hey.

1163
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:48,684
- Hi, Alice.
- Hi, Uncle Barry.

1164
01:28:48,685 --> 01:28:50,559
Good to see you.

1165
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:51,759
Scott.

1166
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,839
Hey, Tutu.

1167
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,599
Okay, Alex, why don't we...

1168
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,205
Alex, how are you, honey?

1169
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:59,766
...get some chairs
for Tutu, huh?

1170
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,409
There you are again.

1171
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:18,079
So, what'd you decide?
Not much left to decide.

1172
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:21,343
We're just playing it by ear and
trying to keep her comfortable.

1173
01:29:21,378 --> 01:29:24,607
I mean, what'd you decide about the buyer?
Who's your buyer?

1174
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,363
How much you getting?

1175
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:31,159
Dad, I'm sure you'll be able to
read about that in the paper.

1176
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,879
I don't wanna read about it.
I wanna hear about it now.

1177
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:36,439
Let's not talk about this here.
This isn't the time.

1178
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:39,879
It's all the same to you.
A million here, a million there.

1179
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:41,965
It's just ironic, that's all...

1180
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,608
...Elizabeth coming into this misfortune
just as you're coming into a fortune.

1181
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:50,119
She gave you everything, Matt.

1182
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:52,999
Good, happy home. Beautiful daughters.
What's your point?

1183
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,759
She wanted her own boat, she
should've had her own boat.

1184
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:58,919
Something she would've been familiar with.
She wasn't driving.

1185
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:01,639
Her boat, somebody else's
boat, wouldn't have mattered.

1186
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:03,768
You're not gonna blame
me for this. Ah.

1187
01:30:03,803 --> 01:30:05,330
Quibble about the details.

1188
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:10,040
She was a faithful, devoted wife.
She deserved more.

1189
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:19,081
You're right, she deserved more.

1190
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:22,599
For chrissake, take
it easy on the man.

1191
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,444
You know, my father has been
doing a really amazing job...

1192
01:30:25,479 --> 01:30:27,647
...under these circumstances.

1193
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:40,384
Are we leaving?

1194
01:30:40,419 --> 01:30:42,408
No, Mama, not yet.

1195
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:51,604
Man, that guy is such a prick.

1196
01:30:51,639 --> 01:30:55,048
Is he always like that? Yeah.

1197
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,603
I love you.

1198
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:01,965
Yeah, we went.

1199
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,970
The villages we went to were
in between these corn fields.

1200
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:09,721
Suddenly, bam, hits the tree.

1201
01:34:09,756 --> 01:34:11,165
Work's going okay?

1202
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:20,642
So you've gotta buy
what's there already.

1203
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:22,644
At all price ranges.

1204
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,000
Well, no surprise.

1205
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:37,239
Other than the holdouts who don't
wanna sell at all, it's done.

1206
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:41,125
Holitzer. Chicago group a distant second.
Feels good.

1207
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:45,449
Doing the right thing, Mattie.
At least there ain't gonna be any Walmart.

1208
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:48,204
All right.

1209
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:53,921
Now it's your call. We're all behind you.
Most of us, anyway.

1210
01:34:53,956 --> 01:34:56,685
Go ahead, captain.
Make it official.

1211
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,968
It's strange, is all.

1212
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,802
What's strange?

1213
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:19,727
We didn't do anything to own this land.
It was entrusted to us.

1214
01:35:19,762 --> 01:35:21,563
And now we're just...

1215
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:34,165
I can't do it.
I'm not gonna do it.

1216
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:37,011
What do you mean?
I'm not gonna sign.

1217
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:42,599
What are you doing, man?

1218
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:46,650
We know you got a lot on your plate now,
but you're not gonna fuck this up for us.

1219
01:35:46,685 --> 01:35:47,846
It's over.

1220
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:52,359
I don't want it to
go to Holitzer.

1221
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:54,799
I don't want it to go to anyone.

1222
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,599
I wanna keep it.

1223
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:00,965
Your head's not right, Mattie.
Your head's not right.

1224
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,004
Want a couple of days to think about it?
Take a couple of days.

1225
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:05,925
I don't need a couple of days.

1226
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:08,531
I have the authority, and
this is what I want.

1227
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:12,359
We have other businesses that we're
converting into corporations.

1228
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:15,645
We can figure this out.
You're the trustee, Mattie.

1229
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:18,445
You know better than anyone we
only have seven years left.

1230
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:22,362
Then I have seven years to
figure out how to keep it.

1231
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:32,321
We'll come after you, man.
Just because you're a fucking lawyer...

1232
01:36:32,356 --> 01:36:35,523
...doesn't mean the rest of us
will be afraid to come after you.

1233
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:38,925
But nobody wants to do that.

1234
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,730
We're family.

1235
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:46,682
People will be relieved, Hugh.
The whole state.

1236
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,399
- Oh, shit.
- I sign this document...

1237
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:52,839
...and something that we were
supposed to protect is gone forever.

1238
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:54,919
Now, we're haole as shit.

1239
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:57,045
And we go to private
schools and clubs...

1240
01:36:57,080 --> 01:37:00,607
...and we can barely speak
pidgin, let alone Hawaiian.

1241
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:05,559
But we've got Hawaiian blood,
and we're tied to this land.

1242
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:08,599
And our children are
tied to this land.

1243
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:11,879
Now, it's a miracle that for some
bullshit reason 150 years ago...

1244
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:15,399
...we own this much of
paradise, but we do.

1245
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:19,399
And for whatever bullshit
reason, I'm the trustee now...

1246
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:22,039
...and I'm not signing.

1247
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:23,565
I'm not signing it.

1248
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:27,525
So if you wanna sue me,
it'll just make us closer.

1249
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:42,124
All right.

1250
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:46,405
Listen up, everybody.
Hey, hey, hey.

1251
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:52,044
Cousin Mattie has
an announcement.

1252
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:54,963
Get ready.

1253
01:38:58,320 --> 01:38:59,810
Come in.

1254
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:18,730
Julie?

1255
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:20,526
I know we just met...

1256
01:39:20,527 --> 01:39:23,922
...but I've been thinking about you
guys a lot these last few days...

1257
01:39:23,957 --> 01:39:25,888
...and, uh, I knew
your mom was here.

1258
01:39:25,889 --> 01:39:28,565
I don't know, I just
felt I should come by.

1259
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:32,039
Well, you know Alex. Hi.

1260
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:33,399
Hi. This is Scottie.

1261
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:36,599
And, Sid, this is Mrs. Speer.
Julie.

1262
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:38,845
Julie.
Were you friends with my mom?

1263
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:43,807
No, I never met your mom,
but I know a lot about her.

1264
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:49,489
Listen, Julie, we really
appreciate you coming by...

1265
01:39:49,524 --> 01:39:51,642
...and the flowers are lovely.

1266
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,485
Hey, Scottie, Alex. What?

1267
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:58,363
- Let's go to the cafeteria.
- Okay.

1268
01:39:58,364 --> 01:40:01,759
Yeah, good idea.
Scottie. I'm coming.

1269
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:04,159
Hurry up, Scottie. Hi.

1270
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:07,084
It only took me two seconds.

1271
01:40:07,119 --> 01:40:09,162
Scottie. Coming.

1272
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:26,289
I'm not sure how much you know
about my wife's condition...

1273
01:40:26,324 --> 01:40:28,123
...but, uh, she's
gonna die very soon.

1274
01:40:28,124 --> 01:40:31,602
And actually, that's
sort of why we're here.

1275
01:40:31,637 --> 01:40:33,204
I know.

1276
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:36,286
That's why I came,
because I know.

1277
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:43,123
I came because Brian wouldn't,
and that just didn't seem right.

1278
01:40:43,158 --> 01:40:46,044
I thought someone from
my family should come.

1279
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:49,239
So he told you.

1280
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:51,971
He was acting really weird
that night after you left...

1281
01:40:52,006 --> 01:40:54,964
...and then I just started
smelling it on him.

1282
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,129
I'd already smelled it.

1283
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:04,480
I finally got it out of him, and we
have been going crazy ever since.

1284
01:41:04,515 --> 01:41:07,165
Not easy with the kids around.

1285
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:11,239
It's all just something I
could never have imagined.

1286
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:14,165
And then your family's
decision with the land...

1287
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:17,727
...I think you're doing the
right thing, but Brian is...

1288
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:22,450
It's just so complicated
and confusing.

1289
01:41:22,485 --> 01:41:24,010
I know.

1290
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:29,005
I'm angry.

1291
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:31,805
But I'm just so sorry.

1292
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:35,490
I can't imagine what you
must be going through.

1293
01:41:35,525 --> 01:41:39,121
Do you mind if I say
something to her?

1294
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:43,766
Okay.

1295
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:59,463
Elizabeth, I'm Julie.

1296
01:41:59,498 --> 01:42:02,207
I'm Brian's wife.

1297
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:10,321
I just wanna tell you...

1298
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:13,884
I just wanna tell
you I forgive you.

1299
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:22,642
I forgive you for trying
to take Brian away.

1300
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:27,521
I forgive you for trying
to destroy my family.

1301
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:31,959
Because I just...
I have to forgive you.

1302
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:36,719
I just have to forgive you,
even though I should hate you.

1303
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:39,479
Okay, okay, that's enough.
I just have to forgive you.

1304
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:42,165
Really, honestly, I think
that's enough, okay?

1305
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:44,561
Here we go. Thank you, Julie.

1306
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:49,125
Hey.

1307
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:51,049
He didn't love her,
just so you know.

1308
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,602
He didn't really love her.

1309
01:42:54,120 --> 01:42:56,930
That's why I came.

1310
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:01,485
Okay. Okay.

1311
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:03,930
There you go.

1312
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:10,688
Goodbye, Elizabeth.

1313
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,487
Goodbye, my love.

1314
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,723
My friend.

1315
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:21,647
My pain.

1316
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:24,768
My Joy...

1317
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:30,808
Good bye.

1318
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:33,449
Good bye.

1319
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:35,929
Good bye.

1320
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:41,164
<i>Bye.</i>

1321
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:33,682
Well, I guess that's it.

1322
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:18,839
<i>There are few places harder
to get to in this world...</i>

1323
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:22,399
<i>...but there aren't any
where it's harder to live.</i>

1324
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:25,239
<i>The average temperature here
at the bottom of the Earth...</i>

1325
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:27,285
<i>...is a balmy 58
degrees below...</i>

1326
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:29,400
<i>- One strawberry.
- ... when the sun is out.</i>

1327
01:48:29,401 --> 01:48:30,604
One mocha chip.

1328
01:48:30,605 --> 01:48:32,967
<i>It wasn't always like this.
Great.</i>

1329
01:48:32,968 --> 01:48:35,679
<i>Antarctica used to be
a tropical place...</i>

1330
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:38,799
<i>...densely forested and
teeming with life.</i>

1331
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:42,079
<i>But then the continent
started to drift south...</i>

1332
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:44,242
<i>...and by the time it
was done drifting...</i>

1333
01:48:44,243 --> 01:48:49,770
<i>...the dense forests
had all been ice.</i>

1334
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:57,327
<i>As for the former inhabitants, they'd
all died or moved on long ago.</i>

1335
01:48:57,362 --> 01:49:00,961
<i>Well, almost all of them.</i>

1336
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:06,119
<i>The emperor penguin is
technically a bird...</i>

1337
01:49:06,120 --> 01:49:09,919
<i>...although one that makes
his home in the sea.</i>

1338
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:12,879
<i>So if you're wondering what he's
doing up here on the ice...</i>

1339
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:16,079
<i>...well, that's
part of our story.</i>

1340
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:18,405
<i>Each year at around
the same time...</i>

1341
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:20,841
<i>...he will leave the comfort
of his ocean home...</i>

1342
01:49:20,842 --> 01:49:23,319
<i>...and embark on a
remarkable journey.</i>

1343
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:25,919
<i>He will travel a great distance.</i>

1344
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:28,925
<i>And though he is a
bird, he won't fly.</i>

1345
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:32,521
<i>Though he lives in the
sea, he won't swim.</i>

1346
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:26,599
<i>Mom, I love you.</i>

1347
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:32,719
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

1348
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:37,239
<i>Wait for me, Mom.</i>

1349
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:40,084
Be home real soon.

1350
01:53:40,119 --> 01:53:42,686
<i>Real soon.</i>

1351
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:48,079
<i>I never knew.</i>

1352
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:54,439
<i>How much you meant to me.</i>

1353
01:53:54,440 --> 01:54:01,239
<i>Now that I'm so many miles away.</i>

1354
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:04,759
<i>From you.</i>

1355
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:09,479
<i>Only God knows.</i>

1356
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:15,439
<i>When and where we'll meet again.</i>

1357
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:20,159
<i>To hold you in my arms.</i>

1358
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:25,959
<i>Once more.</i>

1359
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:31,119
<i>To hear your voice.</i>

1360
01:54:31,120 --> 01:54:36,559
<i>To see your smile.</i>

1361
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:41,599
<i>Oh, God, do please.</i>

1362
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:47,565
<i>Keep my mom.</i>

1363
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:54,609
<i>Please keep my mom</i>
