1
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:41,172
War began between Germany
and France on August 3rd 1914.

2
00:01:42,173 --> 00:01:44,842
Five weeks later
the German army had smashed its way

3
00:01:44,926 --> 00:01:47,178
to within 18 miles of Paris.

4
00:01:47,345 --> 00:01:51,432
There, the battered French rallied
their forces at the Marne river

5
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,770
and, in a series of unexpected
counterattacks, drove the Germans back.

6
00:01:55,937 --> 00:01:58,606
The front was stabilised,
then shortly afterwards

7
00:01:58,773 --> 00:02:02,276
developed into a continuous
line of heavily fortified trenches,

8
00:02:02,443 --> 00:02:07,448
zigzagging their way 500 miles from
the English Channel to the Swiss frontier.

9
00:02:08,783 --> 00:02:12,453
By 1916, after two grisly years
of trench warfare,

10
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,623
the battle lines had changed very little.

11
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,127
Successful attacks were
measured in hundreds of yards,

12
00:02:19,293 --> 00:02:22,296
and paid for in lives
by hundreds of thousands.

13
00:02:25,967 --> 00:02:27,635
General Broulard, sir.

14
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:32,390
- Hello, George. How are you?
- Paul. Wonderful seeing you again.

15
00:02:32,557 --> 00:02:34,642
Well, this is splendid.

16
00:02:35,727 --> 00:02:38,062
Superb!

17
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:40,982
I try to create a pleasant atmosphere
in which to work.

18
00:02:41,149 --> 00:02:45,319
You've succeeded marvellously. I wish
I had your taste in carpets and pictures.

19
00:02:45,528 --> 00:02:48,740
You're much too kind, George.
Sit down, George.

20
00:02:48,906 --> 00:02:54,078
I haven't done very much. The place is
much the same as it was when I moved in.

21
00:02:54,996 --> 00:02:58,833
Paul, I've come to see you
about something big.

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,004
It's top-secret. It must go no further
than your Chief of Staff, and not to him,

23
00:03:03,171 --> 00:03:06,007
- unless you can trust his discretion.
- Of course.

24
00:03:06,257 --> 00:03:09,344
A group of armies is forming
on this front for an offensive.

25
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,097
Headquarters is determined to make
a breakthrough. You're smiling.

26
00:03:13,264 --> 00:03:17,769
I'm sorry. I thought for a moment I knew
what you were going to say. Please go on.

27
00:03:17,935 --> 00:03:21,856
I never knew you were a mind-reader.
What did you think I was about to say?

28
00:03:22,023 --> 00:03:24,859
- Something about the Ant Hill.
- You are a mind-reader.

29
00:03:25,026 --> 00:03:28,279
Well, it is a key position. It's in my sector.

30
00:03:28,446 --> 00:03:32,950
To be honest, I've heard some talk.
Nothing is secret around headquarters.

31
00:03:33,117 --> 00:03:36,871
- Well, what do you think?
- It's the key to the German position here.

32
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:41,459
They've held onto it for a year and it looks
as if they'll hold onto it for another year.

33
00:03:41,626 --> 00:03:45,713
I have orders to take the Ant Hill no later
than the 10th, the day after tomorrow.

34
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,965
That comes close to being ridiculous.

35
00:03:48,132 --> 00:03:50,885
I wouldn't be here if I really thought that.

36
00:03:52,553 --> 00:03:56,891
Paul, if there's one man in this army
who can do this for me, it's you.

37
00:03:57,058 --> 00:04:00,311
It's out of the question.
Absolutely out of the question.

38
00:04:00,478 --> 00:04:02,313
My division was cut to pieces.

39
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,150
What's left is in no position
to hold the Ant Hill, let alone take it.

40
00:04:06,317 --> 00:04:08,319
I'm sorry, but that's the truth.

41
00:04:09,404 --> 00:04:12,657
Well, Paul, there was something else
I wanted to tell you.

42
00:04:12,824 --> 00:04:15,576
But you may misunderstand
my motives in mentioning it.

43
00:04:15,743 --> 00:04:18,079
What was it?

44
00:04:18,246 --> 00:04:20,415
You'd be bound to misunderstand.

45
00:04:20,581 --> 00:04:24,002
However, as your friend,
maybe I should tell you.

46
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:26,754
- What are you trying to say, George?
- Paul...

47
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:30,425
the talk is that you are being
considered for the 12th Corps.

48
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,511
- The 12th Corps?
- Yes, and with that, another star.

49
00:04:33,678 --> 00:04:38,599
I've pushed it all I can. They need a
fighting general and you're overdue a star.

50
00:04:38,766 --> 00:04:41,936
Your record is good enough
for you to refuse this assignment

51
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,855
on the grounds you've stated.

52
00:04:44,063 --> 00:04:48,234
No one would question your opinion.
They'd get someone else to do the job.

53
00:04:48,443 --> 00:04:52,030
So you shouldn't let this
influence your opinion, Paul.

54
00:04:54,115 --> 00:04:58,119
- Oh, I'm sorry. Have a cognac?
- No, thanks. Not before dinner.

55
00:05:01,622 --> 00:05:04,959
George, I'm responsible
for the lives of 8,000 men.

56
00:05:06,294 --> 00:05:08,963
What is my ambition against that?

57
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,342
What is my reputation
in comparison to that?

58
00:05:12,508 --> 00:05:14,719
My men come first of all, George,

59
00:05:14,886 --> 00:05:17,472
- and those men know it, too.
- I know that they do.

60
00:05:17,638 --> 00:05:22,393
- They know I would never let them down.
- That goes without saying.

61
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,982
The life of one soldier means more to me
than all the stars and honours in France.

62
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:30,401
So...

63
00:05:30,568 --> 00:05:34,405
you think this attack is beyond
the ability of your men at this time?

64
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:36,783
I didn't say that, George.

65
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:41,579
Nothing is beyond those men
once their fighting spirit is aroused.

66
00:05:41,746 --> 00:05:44,165
I won't push you
if you think it's ill-advised.

67
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:47,835
Don't worry, George.
You couldn't do that if you tried.

68
00:05:49,128 --> 00:05:52,340
Of course, artillery would
make an enormous difference.

69
00:05:52,507 --> 00:05:55,593
- What artillery support can you give me?
- I'll see.

70
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,762
- What about replacements?
- We'll see,

71
00:05:57,929 --> 00:06:01,182
but I feel sure you can get along
with what you have.

72
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:05,687
- We might just do it.
- I knew that I was right to come to you.

73
00:06:05,853 --> 00:06:08,856
You are the man to take the Ant Hill.
Now, as for that star...

74
00:06:09,023 --> 00:06:11,025
That had nothing to do with my decision.

75
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:14,946
- If anything, it'd sway me the other way.
- I realise that perfectly.

76
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:19,283
- Now, when do you see this coming off?
- No later than the day after tomorrow.

77
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,952
We just might do it.

78
00:06:43,474 --> 00:06:46,978
Hello there, soldier.
Ready to kill more Germans?

79
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:50,314
- What's your name, soldier?
- Sir, Private Ferol, Company A.

80
00:06:50,565 --> 00:06:52,150
- Are you married?
- No, sir.

81
00:06:52,316 --> 00:06:54,652
Well, I'll bet your mother's proud of you.

82
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:57,739
Well, carry on, Private.
And good luck to you.

83
00:06:57,905 --> 00:06:59,907
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

84
00:07:06,414 --> 00:07:09,167
Hello there, soldier.
Ready to kill more Germans?

85
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:10,585
Yes, sir.

86
00:07:10,752 --> 00:07:15,006
Working over your rifle, I see.
That's the way. It's a soldier's best friend.

87
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:18,092
You be good to it,
and it'll always be good to you.

88
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:25,016
Well, good luck to you, soldier. Carry on.

89
00:07:52,377 --> 00:07:54,379
Hello there, soldier.

90
00:07:54,545 --> 00:07:56,547
Ready to kill more Germans?

91
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:00,885
Is everything all right, soldier?

92
00:08:01,052 --> 00:08:04,889
- All right? Yes, sir. I'm all right.
- Ah-ha. Good fella.

93
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,060
- Are you married, soldier?
- Married? Me married?

94
00:08:09,977 --> 00:08:11,813
Yes. Have you got a wife?

95
00:08:12,063 --> 00:08:15,900
- A wife? Have I got a wife?
- Sir, he's a bit shell-shocked.

96
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:20,822
I beg your pardon, Sergeant.
There is no such thing as shell shock.

97
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:22,824
Have you got a wife, soldier?

98
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,660
My wife? My wife.

99
00:08:25,827 --> 00:08:30,081
Yes, I have a wife. I'm never going to
see her again. I'm going to be killed.

100
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:31,916
You're acting like a coward!

101
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,502
- I am a coward.
- Snap out of it, soldier!

102
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:38,756
Sergeant, arrange for the immediate
transfer of this baby out of my regiment!

103
00:08:38,923 --> 00:08:41,426
I won't have other brave men
contaminated by him!

104
00:08:41,592 --> 00:08:43,678
- Yes, sir.
- Carry on, Sergeant.

105
00:08:47,098 --> 00:08:51,102
You were right, sir. This sort of thing
can spread if it isn't checked.

106
00:08:51,185 --> 00:08:53,271
General, I'm convinced that your tours

107
00:08:53,354 --> 00:08:56,107
have an incalculable effect
upon the men's morale.

108
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,943
The fighting spirit
of the 701st derives from it.

109
00:08:59,193 --> 00:09:01,946
No, Major, that spirit
was just born in them.

110
00:09:08,536 --> 00:09:10,747
The general is coming, sir.

111
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:29,682
- Always a pleasure to see you, Colonel.
- I'm honoured, General.

112
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:33,478
Well, quite a neat little spot you have here.

113
00:09:33,644 --> 00:09:37,315
I'll reserve comment on
the neatness, sir, but it is little.

114
00:09:37,482 --> 00:09:41,069
- Pretty shy on seating accommodation.
- More than enough for me.

115
00:09:41,277 --> 00:09:44,405
Never got the habit of sitting.
Like to be on my feet.

116
00:09:44,489 --> 00:09:47,241
- Keep on the move.
- I can vouch for that, Colonel.

117
00:09:47,408 --> 00:09:50,578
I can hardly get him behind a desk
long enough to sign an order.

118
00:09:50,828 --> 00:09:52,747
That's the way I am, Dax.

119
00:09:52,914 --> 00:09:55,833
I can't understand these armchair officers.

120
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,004
Fellas trying to fight a war from behind
a desk. Waving papers at the enemy!

121
00:10:00,171 --> 00:10:03,216
Worrying whether a mouse is
going to run up their pants leg.

122
00:10:03,424 --> 00:10:07,929
If I had the choice between mice and
Mausers, I'd take the mice every time.

123
00:10:08,096 --> 00:10:11,099
You'll never make me believe that.
Seriously, though,

124
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:15,353
if a man's a ninny, let him put on
a dress and hide under the bed.

125
00:10:15,436 --> 00:10:18,356
But if he wants to be a soldier,
then he's got to be one.

126
00:10:18,523 --> 00:10:22,527
He's got to fight, and he can't do that
unless he's where the fighting is.

127
00:10:22,777 --> 00:10:25,446
- That's my credo.
- I think I have to agree with you,

128
00:10:25,613 --> 00:10:28,866
presenting your case so convincingly, sir.

129
00:10:29,033 --> 00:10:32,453
- I imagine you'd like a look around.
- Yes, Colonel.

130
00:10:32,704 --> 00:10:35,289
Here's something to see - the Ant Hill.

131
00:10:35,373 --> 00:10:38,459
It's as good a view as you can get
without being there.

132
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:40,628
That won't be long now, will it?

133
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:48,886
Hm. Yeah.

134
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,725
Well, I've seen much more formidable
objectives. Much, much worse.

135
00:11:00,648 --> 00:11:05,737
Not something we can grab and run
away with, but certainly pregnable.

136
00:11:05,903 --> 00:11:08,573
- Sounds kind of odd, though.
- Why?

137
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,243
- Like something to do with giving birth.
- Oh, yes. Quite.

138
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:16,039
You're right on your toes this morning.
Even sharper than usual.

139
00:11:16,164 --> 00:11:20,918
We mustn't forget the colonel was the
foremost criminal lawyer in all France.

140
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:24,088
Gentlemen, you're both much too kind.

141
00:11:24,756 --> 00:11:27,425
Colonel, how did your relief
come off last night?

142
00:11:27,675 --> 00:11:30,470
We drew some artillery. 29 casualties, sir.

143
00:11:30,678 --> 00:11:34,599
Yes, noticed it on the road in.
utterly inexcusable. Stupid.

144
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:38,269
All swarmed together like flies,
waiting for someone to swat them.

145
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:43,358
They never learn. They get in a tight spot
under heavy fire, gang up every time.

146
00:11:43,524 --> 00:11:46,361
Herd instinct, I suppose.
A lower animal sort of thing.

147
00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:50,365
A human sort of thing, it seems to me.
Don't you make a distinction, Major?

148
00:11:50,531 --> 00:11:54,285
Yes, very regrettable, of course.
Very. Yes, indeed.

149
00:11:54,452 --> 00:11:57,705
Major, would you be kind enough
to excuse us for a few minutes?

150
00:11:57,872 --> 00:11:59,874
Yes, sir. Of course.

151
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,960
Colonel.

152
00:12:06,964 --> 00:12:09,634
Well, Colonel, what do you think of it?

153
00:12:09,801 --> 00:12:12,637
- What do I think of what, sir?
- The Ant Hill.

154
00:12:12,804 --> 00:12:16,557
Colonel, your regiment is going
to take the Ant Hill tomorrow.

155
00:12:17,642 --> 00:12:21,229
- You know the condition of my men, sir.
- Men will have to be killed.

156
00:12:21,396 --> 00:12:24,732
Possibly a lot of them.
They absorb bullets and shrapnel,

157
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:27,235
making it possible
for others to get through.

158
00:12:27,402 --> 00:12:30,822
- What support will we have?
- I have none to give you.

159
00:12:31,906 --> 00:12:34,659
What sort of casualties
do you anticipate, sir?

160
00:12:34,826 --> 00:12:39,163
Say 5%killed by our own barrage.
That's a very generous allowance.

161
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,666
10%more in getting
through no-man's-land,

162
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,918
and 20%more getting through the wire.

163
00:12:44,085 --> 00:12:47,922
That leaves 65%,
with the worst part of the job over.

164
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:52,010
Let's say another 25%
in actually taking the Ant Hill.

165
00:12:52,176 --> 00:12:55,179
We're still left with a force
more than adequate to hold it.

166
00:12:55,346 --> 00:12:58,182
You're saying that more than
half my men will be killed.

167
00:12:58,349 --> 00:13:03,021
Yes, it's a terrible price to pay, Colonel,
but we will have the Ant Hill.

168
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:07,275
- But will we, sir?
- I'm depending on you, Colonel.

169
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:09,444
All France is depending on you.

170
00:13:13,197 --> 00:13:15,116
Am I amusing you, Colonel?

171
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:19,787
I'm not a bull. I don't need a flag
waving to get me to charge.

172
00:13:19,954 --> 00:13:22,790
I don't like comparing
our flag to a bullfighter's cape.

173
00:13:22,957 --> 00:13:24,959
I meant no disrespect to our flag.

174
00:13:25,126 --> 00:13:28,463
Patriotism may be old-fashioned,
but a patriot is an honest man.

175
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:32,550
Samuel Johnson had something else
to say about patriotism.

176
00:13:32,717 --> 00:13:35,053
And what was that, may I ask?

177
00:13:35,803 --> 00:13:37,972
- Nothing, really.
- What do you mean?

178
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:41,559
- Sir, nothing important.
- When I ask a question, it's important.

179
00:13:41,726 --> 00:13:43,978
- Now who was this man?
- Samuel Johnson, sir.

180
00:13:44,145 --> 00:13:46,814
What did he have to say about patriotism?

181
00:13:46,981 --> 00:13:52,320
That it was the last refuge of a scoundrel,
sir. I'm sorry, I meant nothing personal.

182
00:13:52,403 --> 00:13:55,573
You're tired, Dax. You're very tired.

183
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,992
It's you who is exhausted, not your men.

184
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:01,746
And it's my fault. I've given you
one impossible task after another.

185
00:14:01,913 --> 00:14:03,748
- You need rest.
- I haven't said...

186
00:14:03,915 --> 00:14:07,335
You never would, so you aren't
going to have any say-so about it.

187
00:14:07,502 --> 00:14:10,254
As from now, I'm ordering you
on indefinite furlough.

188
00:14:10,421 --> 00:14:12,674
General, you can't do that to me.

189
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,926
Not to you, Dax. For you.

190
00:14:15,093 --> 00:14:18,513
- For your good and the good of your men.
- The good of my men, sir?

191
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,433
If a commanding officer lacks confidence,
what can we expect of his men?

192
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,688
I don't want to relieve you, but
I must have your enthusiastic support.

193
00:14:26,854 --> 00:14:30,441
Not once have you said
that your men can take the Ant Hill.

194
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,362
We'll take the Ant Hill.

195
00:14:36,114 --> 00:14:39,450
If any soldiers in the worid can take it,

196
00:14:39,617 --> 00:14:41,786
we'll take the Ant Hill.

197
00:14:41,953 --> 00:14:45,123
And when you do, your men will
be relieved and get a long rest.

198
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:04,225
Corporal Paris and Private Lejeune
reporting, sir.

199
00:15:04,475 --> 00:15:07,562
- You took your time.
- We prepared as quick as we could, sir.

200
00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:11,399
- We had to alert the sentries.
- All right. You men at ease.

201
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:14,318
This is a reconnaissance patrol.
German wire,

202
00:15:14,485 --> 00:15:17,155
machine-gun posts,
identification of bodies.

203
00:15:17,321 --> 00:15:20,658
There will only be the three of us.
We're to avoid a fight if we can.

204
00:15:22,744 --> 00:15:26,414
We go out to the left and we come
back through post six on the right.

205
00:15:26,581 --> 00:15:29,834
- Is it all clear at post six?
- All the sentries have been warned.

206
00:15:30,168 --> 00:15:33,338
Number six will send up flares
at 10-minute intervals.

207
00:15:33,504 --> 00:15:38,259
- I wanted them every five minutes.
- I know. The sergeant says it's too much.

208
00:15:38,426 --> 00:15:42,263
- He says it will draw artillery.
- He's some strategist. What's his name?

209
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,265
I don't know, sir.

210
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,936
All right. You men wait outside.
I'll join you in a minute.

211
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,189
Would you mind telling us the password?

212
00:15:51,356 --> 00:15:53,358
- Calais.
- Yes, sir.

213
00:16:02,283 --> 00:16:05,620
- He's fortifying himself.
- It smelled like heaven.

214
00:16:05,787 --> 00:16:08,706
I can always tell when he's had a few.
He gets sarcastic.

215
00:16:08,873 --> 00:16:11,876
At least he could have
passed it around, the pig.

216
00:16:12,043 --> 00:16:14,796
What's he got against you, anyway?

217
00:16:14,962 --> 00:16:17,465
We went to school together
before the war.

218
00:16:17,632 --> 00:16:21,469
He thinks I don't have enough
respect for him. He's right.

219
00:16:22,887 --> 00:16:25,306
If you gentlemen are ready.

220
00:16:29,977 --> 00:16:30,895
Colonel.

221
00:16:31,062 --> 00:16:33,815
- Everything clear and understood?
- Yes, sir.

222
00:16:33,981 --> 00:16:38,736
The lane through our wire's in front here.
Machine gun's pointing at the opening.

223
00:16:38,903 --> 00:16:40,822
- Good luck, men.
- Thank you, sir.

224
00:16:40,988 --> 00:16:42,990
All right, men. Let's go.

225
00:18:38,272 --> 00:18:41,109
- What's that?
- I don't know.

226
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:46,447
Lejeune, move out and look
that over. We'll cover you.

227
00:18:46,614 --> 00:18:48,908
Split up a night patrol?

228
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:51,285
Move out, Lejeune.

229
00:20:15,536 --> 00:20:20,416
- I don't like this. Let's get outta here.
- We haven't given him enough time.

230
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:29,967
- If we wait any longer, they'll get us too.
- We've gotta wait for him.

231
00:20:33,888 --> 00:20:36,140
He must be dead! Where is he?

232
00:21:34,949 --> 00:21:37,702
- Well!
- Surprised, Lieutenant?

233
00:21:37,785 --> 00:21:41,289
Yes, I am. Happily surprised.
I thought you'd been killed.

234
00:21:41,497 --> 00:21:45,710
- You didn't wait to find out, did you?
- Look here, what do you mean?

235
00:21:45,918 --> 00:21:49,047
I mean you ran like a rabbit
after you killed Lejeune.

236
00:21:49,213 --> 00:21:52,842
Killed Lejeune?
What are you talking about?

237
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:55,303
I don't think I like your tone.

238
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,306
You're speaking to an officer.
Remember that.

239
00:21:58,473 --> 00:22:01,142
Well, I must be mistaken, then, sir.

240
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:03,644
An officer wouldn't do that.

241
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:08,149
A man wouldn't do it. Only a thing would.

242
00:22:08,316 --> 00:22:11,986
A sneaky, booze-guzzling,
yellow-bellied rat

243
00:22:12,111 --> 00:22:14,655
with a bottle for a brain
and a streak of spit...

244
00:22:14,822 --> 00:22:18,368
- That's enough, Corporal.
- You've got yourself into a mess.

245
00:22:18,576 --> 00:22:21,496
I have, have I?
You've got yourself in a worse one.

246
00:22:21,621 --> 00:22:26,459
First, general insubordination.
Second, threatening your superior officer.

247
00:22:26,668 --> 00:22:30,755
Third, refusing to obey an order
and inciting others to do the same.

248
00:22:31,005 --> 00:22:33,508
How do you think those charges
will look on paper?

249
00:22:33,675 --> 00:22:35,760
Not half as bad as these:

250
00:22:35,927 --> 00:22:40,264
endangering the lives of your men
through recklessness, drunk on duty,

251
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,850
wanton murder of one of your own men,

252
00:22:43,017 --> 00:22:45,436
and cowardice in the face of the enemy.

253
00:22:47,772 --> 00:22:52,652
Phillip, have you ever tried to bring
charges against an officer?

254
00:22:52,694 --> 00:22:55,405
It's my word against yours, you know.

255
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,991
Whose word do you think
they're gonna believe?

256
00:22:58,199 --> 00:23:02,537
Let me put it another way. Whose word
do you think they're going to accept?

257
00:23:02,704 --> 00:23:05,123
Now, I'll tell you what I'm willing to do.

258
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:08,292
So far, all I have written in this report

259
00:23:08,459 --> 00:23:11,879
is that you and Lejeune
were killed while out on patrol.

260
00:23:11,963 --> 00:23:14,215
I'll make it read
that you made your way back

261
00:23:14,382 --> 00:23:16,551
after getting separated in the skirmish.

262
00:23:16,718 --> 00:23:19,303
- That'll end the matter...
- You killed Lejeune.

263
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,222
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

264
00:23:21,389 --> 00:23:24,809
I'd give anything in the worid
if it hadn't had happened.

265
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:29,480
Honestly, I know you don't like me, but
what kind of a man do you think I am?

266
00:23:31,065 --> 00:23:33,818
- Oh, good morning, Colonel.
- At ease, men.

267
00:23:33,985 --> 00:23:37,405
- I've been waiting for your report.
- We found out a thing or two.

268
00:23:37,655 --> 00:23:41,326
- Everything go well?
- No, sir. Private Lejeune was killed.

269
00:23:41,492 --> 00:23:43,494
- How did it happen?
- It's in the report.

270
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:46,581
- Let's have it.
- It isn't quite finished yet, sir.

271
00:23:46,748 --> 00:23:50,418
That's all, Corporal. You did
a good night's work. Should feel proud.

272
00:23:50,585 --> 00:23:53,421
- Go get some sleep.
- Yes, sir.

273
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:01,346
- How did you lose Lejeune?
- Machine-gun fire, sir.

274
00:24:01,512 --> 00:24:04,098
He coughed. Almost got us all killed.

275
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:07,935
Finish that report
and get it to me immediately.

276
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:10,021
Yes, sir.

277
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:17,195
The artillery starts at 0515.

278
00:24:18,196 --> 00:24:21,115
The 1st Battalion will move out at 0530.

279
00:24:22,116 --> 00:24:26,037
When the leading elements have cleared
the German wires, the second wave -

280
00:24:26,204 --> 00:24:30,708
the 2nd and 3rd Battalions minus
two companies in reserve - will move out,

281
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:33,378
in no case later than 0540.

282
00:24:35,046 --> 00:24:37,715
That's it, gentlemen.
Are there any questions?

283
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:42,053
Sir, is 15 minutes of artillery
preparation all that we can expect?

284
00:24:42,553 --> 00:24:46,891
The feeling is that any more than that will
give them too much time to get organised.

285
00:24:47,058 --> 00:24:50,061
What's weather supposed
to be like tomorrow, sir?

286
00:24:50,228 --> 00:24:53,815
- Too good.
- No chance of rain or fog?

287
00:24:55,233 --> 00:24:57,652
The forecast is for sun all day.

288
00:24:58,236 --> 00:25:02,073
lf... Perhaps I should say
when we take the Ant Hill,

289
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,827
how long do we have to hold it
before we can expect any support?

290
00:25:05,994 --> 00:25:09,497
General Mireau, who will be
personally observing the attack,

291
00:25:09,664 --> 00:25:12,500
has promised support from
the 72nd by sundown tomorrow,

292
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:16,170
which means, of course,
that we'll have to hold all day.

293
00:25:18,006 --> 00:25:20,675
Are there any more questions?

294
00:25:23,094 --> 00:25:27,181
Well, gentlemen, good luck. I'm sure
you'll come through as you always do.

295
00:25:27,348 --> 00:25:29,017
Let's get some sleep.

296
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:34,022
I'm not afraid of dying,
only of getting killed.

297
00:25:34,188 --> 00:25:37,275
- That's as clear as mud.
- Which would you rather be done in by?

298
00:25:37,442 --> 00:25:40,028
- A bayonet or a machine gun?
- A machine gun.

299
00:25:40,194 --> 00:25:43,698
That's just my point. They're both
pieces of steel ripping into you,

300
00:25:43,865 --> 00:25:46,951
only the machine gun is quicker,
cleaner and less painful.

301
00:25:47,118 --> 00:25:49,037
- So?
- Most of us are more afraid

302
00:25:49,203 --> 00:25:51,873
of getting hurt than of getting killed.

303
00:25:51,956 --> 00:25:56,210
Look at Bernard. He panics when it comes
to gas. Gas doesn't bother me a bit.

304
00:25:56,377 --> 00:25:59,881
He's seen photos of gas cases -
doesn't mean anything to me.

305
00:25:59,964 --> 00:26:03,217
But I'll tell you something.
I'd hate to be without my tin hat.

306
00:26:03,384 --> 00:26:06,054
But I don't mind
not having a tin hat for my tail.

307
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,975
Why? Because I know a wound in the
head would hurt more than one in the tail.

308
00:26:11,142 --> 00:26:14,062
The tail is just meat.
But the head is all bone.

309
00:26:14,228 --> 00:26:16,314
- Speak for yourself.
- Tell me this.

310
00:26:16,564 --> 00:26:18,983
Aside from the bayonet,
what do you fear most?

311
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,903
- High explosives.
- Exactly! It's the same with me,

312
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,823
because I know that it can chew
you up worse than anything else.

313
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:29,077
If you're afraid of dying,
you'd spend your life in a funk

314
00:26:29,243 --> 00:26:31,412
because you know
you've got to go someday.

315
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:36,250
And if it's death you're afraid of, why
should you care about what kills you?

316
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:40,672
You're too smart for me, professor.
All I know is, nobody wants to die.

317
00:26:50,348 --> 00:26:52,934
Through to Division, sir.
Through to Polygon.

318
00:26:53,017 --> 00:26:56,437
Everything quiet.
All units report themselves ready.

319
00:26:56,604 --> 00:26:58,606
Zero minus two.

320
00:26:59,357 --> 00:27:02,360
- May I offer you some cognac?
- Thank you, sir.

321
00:27:06,531 --> 00:27:08,533
After you, sir.

322
00:27:10,118 --> 00:27:12,704
To France.

323
00:28:53,304 --> 00:28:57,058
Minus 15... 14... 13...

324
00:28:59,477 --> 00:29:03,398
10, 9, 8, 7,

325
00:29:03,564 --> 00:29:07,402
6, 5, 4, 3,

326
00:29:07,735 --> 00:29:10,154
2, 1... zero!

327
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:11,419
- Sergeant, where's B Company?
- I don't know, sir.

328
00:32:16,257 --> 00:32:18,509
- Where on earth are they?
- On the left...

329
00:32:18,676 --> 00:32:23,097
Where are the rest?! Zero plus one,
and they're still in the trenches.

330
00:32:23,264 --> 00:32:25,600
Miserable cowards.
They're not advancing!

331
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:30,188
The barrage is getting away from them!
They're still in the trenches!

332
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,859
- Captain Nichols.
- Yes, sir?

333
00:32:36,027 --> 00:32:40,114
Order the 75s to commence
firing on our own positions.

334
00:32:40,281 --> 00:32:44,619
Captain, do you fail to comprehend
the meaning of my order?

335
00:32:44,786 --> 00:32:47,038
No, sir, but... I respectfully ask to...

336
00:32:47,205 --> 00:32:50,375
Captain, do you fail to comprehend
the meaning of my order?

337
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:51,459
No, sir.

338
00:32:51,626 --> 00:32:54,545
- Then carry it out, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

339
00:32:59,717 --> 00:33:02,553
Hello, Polygon? This is Division.

340
00:33:04,472 --> 00:33:07,392
Batteries 1 and 2 commence firing...

341
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:12,480
on coordinates 32-58-78.

342
00:33:12,647 --> 00:33:20,238
Batteries 1 and 2 to commence
firing on coordinates 32-58-78. Over.

343
00:33:28,496 --> 00:33:32,083
The battery commander reports
those are our own positions.

344
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:36,254
- He says it must be a mistake.
- Confirm the order, Captain.

345
00:33:36,587 --> 00:33:38,756
The order is confirmed.

346
00:33:38,923 --> 00:33:42,677
Battery commander respectfully reports
he cannot execute such an order

347
00:33:42,844 --> 00:33:46,431
unless it is in writing
and signed by the general. Over.

348
00:33:47,432 --> 00:33:51,853
Battery commander cannot execute
such an order unless it is in writing,

349
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:55,273
- and signed by the general.
- Give me that phone!

350
00:33:59,861 --> 00:34:02,947
- General Mireau speaking!
- Battery commander speaking.

351
00:34:03,281 --> 00:34:07,535
The troops are mutinying,
refusing to advance. Fire as ordered!

352
00:34:07,702 --> 00:34:11,372
With all respect, you have no right
to order me to shoot down my own men

353
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:14,959
unless you are willing
to take full responsibility for it.

354
00:34:15,126 --> 00:34:17,545
Captain Rousseau,
will you obey my order?

355
00:34:17,712 --> 00:34:21,382
I must have a written order before
I can execute such a command, sir.

356
00:34:21,549 --> 00:34:23,634
Supposing you're killed. Where will I be?

357
00:34:23,801 --> 00:34:27,221
In front of a firing squad
tomorrow morning, that's where!

358
00:34:27,388 --> 00:34:31,726
Hand over your command and report
yourself under arrest to my headquarters.

359
00:34:42,987 --> 00:34:47,742
Roget! Lieutenant Roget,
why are your men still in here?

360
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:52,163
- It's impossible, sir. Major Vignon is dead.
- Get these men out of the trenches!

361
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:55,249
Come on! Let's get ready for another try.

362
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:59,087
- Get these men outta here!
- I tried three times.

363
00:34:59,253 --> 00:35:01,839
All right! Let's give it another try!

364
00:35:02,006 --> 00:35:04,759
Come on! Let's give it another try!

365
00:35:15,603 --> 00:35:18,940
It's impossible, sir.
All the men are falling back.

366
00:35:20,108 --> 00:35:23,695
Sir, I respectfully submit to the colonel...

367
00:35:24,612 --> 00:35:29,117
Pardon me. Your remarks to me
were very unfair, sir.

368
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:32,954
It's just impossible.
It's just impossible.

369
00:35:33,121 --> 00:35:36,624
According to reports,
the attack has failed all along the line.

370
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:39,460
The men are falling back
to our own trenches.

371
00:35:39,544 --> 00:35:44,215
Major Saint-Auban, arrange for the
immediate relief of the 701st Regiment.

372
00:35:44,382 --> 00:35:48,302
Have them sent to the Château de I'Aigle.
Have Colonel Dax report to me.

373
00:35:48,386 --> 00:35:51,389
Major Couderc, assemble
a general court martial.

374
00:35:51,556 --> 00:35:54,058
Have it meet at 3 o'clock
tomorrow afternoon.

375
00:35:54,225 --> 00:35:58,021
If those sweethearts won't face
German bullets, they'll face French ones!

376
00:36:09,157 --> 00:36:12,869
I ordered an attack.
Your troops refused to attack.

377
00:36:12,994 --> 00:36:15,455
They attacked,
but they could make no headway.

378
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:20,084
Because they didn't try. I saw it myself.
Half of your men never left the trenches.

379
00:36:20,168 --> 00:36:23,004
A third of my men were
pinned down by the intense fire.

380
00:36:23,171 --> 00:36:25,882
Don't quibble over fractions, Colonel.

381
00:36:26,007 --> 00:36:29,552
A good part of your men
never left their own trenches.

382
00:36:29,677 --> 00:36:33,431
Colonel Dax, I'm going to have 10 men
from each company in your regiment

383
00:36:33,598 --> 00:36:36,434
tried under penalty of death
for cowardice.

384
00:36:36,601 --> 00:36:38,853
- Penalty of death...?
- For cowardice!

385
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:43,608
- They have skimmed milk for blood.
- It's the reddest milk I've ever seen.

386
00:36:43,858 --> 00:36:46,277
- That's enough...
- I'm not gonna mince words...

387
00:36:46,486 --> 00:36:49,947
Colonel Dax, if you continue in
this manner, you shall be arrested.

388
00:36:50,156 --> 00:36:53,701
I believe the colonel has a point,
even though he makes it bluntly.

389
00:36:53,868 --> 00:36:56,663
This is not a trial,
but it does bear aspects of one.

390
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:01,125
Colonel Dax technically is cast in the role
of the defence. With such grave charges,

391
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:04,545
a court of law would grant him
latitude in presenting his case.

392
00:37:04,712 --> 00:37:07,965
Latitude is one thing,
insubordination another.

393
00:37:08,299 --> 00:37:12,804
I am merely offering an opinion. Please
do not feel constrained to accept it.

394
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:16,140
I'm perfectly willing to accept it,
General Broulard.

395
00:37:16,391 --> 00:37:19,977
I'm sorry, sir. I certainly
didn't intend to be insubordinate.

396
00:37:20,103 --> 00:37:22,188
My only aim is
to remind you of the heroism

397
00:37:22,397 --> 00:37:25,149
these men have shown
on every occasion in the past.

398
00:37:25,316 --> 00:37:28,194
We're talking about the present.

399
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:31,489
Sir, they're not cowards.
If some didn't leave the trenches,

400
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:33,950
it must have been
because it was impossible.

401
00:37:34,158 --> 00:37:38,496
They were ordered to attack.
It was their duty to obey that order.

402
00:37:38,621 --> 00:37:42,291
We can't leave it up to the men to decide
when an order is possible or not.

403
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:48,172
If it was impossible, the only proof would
be their dead bodies lying in the trenches.

404
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:51,843
They're scum, Colonel.
The whole rotten regiment.

405
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:55,179
A pack of sneaking,
whining, tail-dragging curs.

406
00:37:55,346 --> 00:37:59,726
- Do you really believe that, sir?
- Yes, I do. That's exactly what I believe.

407
00:37:59,851 --> 00:38:02,937
And what's more,
it's an incontestable fact.

408
00:38:03,104 --> 00:38:05,356
Then why not shoot the entire regiment?

409
00:38:05,481 --> 00:38:08,860
- I'm serious.
- Now, Colonel, you're missing the point.

410
00:38:09,027 --> 00:38:12,697
We don't want to slaughter the French
army. We want to set an example.

411
00:38:12,864 --> 00:38:15,533
- If it's an example you want, take me.
- Take you?

412
00:38:15,658 --> 00:38:19,287
Yes, sir. If it's an example you want,
one man will do as well as 100.

413
00:38:19,454 --> 00:38:23,791
The logical choice is the officer
most responsible for the attack.

414
00:38:25,293 --> 00:38:29,714
Now, Colonel, I think you're overwrought.
This is not a question of officers.

415
00:38:29,881 --> 00:38:33,051
Paul, we don't want to overdo this thing.

416
00:38:33,301 --> 00:38:35,803
Suppose we just make it a dozen?

417
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:38,848
I was talking of 100 men.
Now we're down to 12.

418
00:38:39,057 --> 00:38:41,309
Let's not haggle over this thing any more.

419
00:38:41,434 --> 00:38:45,813
Let's get it settled once and for all
so that we can all live with it.

420
00:38:46,731 --> 00:38:51,486
Well, perhaps I was a bit too anxious
to see proper justice meted out.

421
00:38:51,653 --> 00:38:53,696
I've spent my entire life in the army.

422
00:38:53,821 --> 00:38:56,157
I've always tried
to be true to my principles.

423
00:38:56,324 --> 00:38:59,410
That's the only mistake
I can ever be accused of.

424
00:39:00,328 --> 00:39:04,666
I'll settle for this: have the company
commanders select one man

425
00:39:04,832 --> 00:39:07,835
from each company
in the first wave - three in all.

426
00:39:08,044 --> 00:39:10,129
That's very reasonable of you, Paul.

427
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,925
The court martial will meet
at the château at three o'clock.

428
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:17,178
- Will that be convenient for you?
- I won't be there, Paul.

429
00:39:17,345 --> 00:39:21,849
- You won't be there?
- I think it best that you handle this matter.

430
00:39:22,016 --> 00:39:23,017
Probably so.

431
00:39:23,142 --> 00:39:28,606
General Mireau, if possible, I'd like to
be appointed counsellor for the accused.

432
00:39:28,773 --> 00:39:32,527
- I'll take the matter under consideration.
- We can permit that, Paul.

433
00:39:32,694 --> 00:39:35,530
- Consider it settled, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir.

434
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:40,368
Noon straight up. I hope
you can stay for lunch, Colonel.

435
00:39:40,535 --> 00:39:43,246
George, I'm afraid
the colonel won't have time.

436
00:39:43,454 --> 00:39:46,290
Don't deny it, Paul.
You've been hiding this man.

437
00:39:46,457 --> 00:39:48,876
Keeping him for your own.
That was very selfish!

438
00:39:49,043 --> 00:39:52,880
Thank you for your courtesy,
but it isn't long until three o'clock.

439
00:39:53,131 --> 00:39:57,969
Of course, Colonel. I shall look forward
to the pleasure of seeing you again.

440
00:40:17,113 --> 00:40:18,072
Yes, Captain?

441
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:21,284
They ordered me to report
to you here. Captain Rousseau.

442
00:40:21,409 --> 00:40:22,910
Yes, of course.

443
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,831
I wanted to speak to you
about some of your shells falling short.

444
00:40:26,998 --> 00:40:29,083
I haven't time to go into it now.

445
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,420
Report back to your command
until further orders.

446
00:40:35,006 --> 00:40:38,217
- Bad stuff. Demoralises the men.
- I quite agree with you.

447
00:40:38,343 --> 00:40:42,847
- We should shelve him to another outfit.
- A court of inquiry should roast him first.

448
00:40:43,097 --> 00:40:47,685
In cases like this, shells falling short,
I always try to avoid an inquiry.

449
00:40:47,852 --> 00:40:51,272
It gets around among the men
and makes a bad impression.

450
00:40:51,439 --> 00:40:55,526
- Shelving would be the best discipline.
- Perhaps you're right.

451
00:40:55,693 --> 00:40:58,571
Would you excuse me?
I want to speak to the colonel.

452
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:02,784
- I'll join you in the dining room.
- Splendid. In a moment.

453
00:41:02,992 --> 00:41:06,204
That's Captain Sancy,
Captain Renoir and Lieutenant Roget

454
00:41:06,287 --> 00:41:09,123
to meet me at regimental
headquarters in half an hour.

455
00:41:09,248 --> 00:41:12,919
- Colonel Dax!
- Yes, General?

456
00:41:13,044 --> 00:41:15,755
- I'd like a word with you.
- Certainly, sir.

457
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:19,467
Best be sensible about this.

458
00:41:19,676 --> 00:41:22,011
Sensible, sir?

459
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:26,641
Listen to me, Dax. Give up
this fancy talk with me, you understand?

460
00:41:26,724 --> 00:41:30,561
Colonel Broulard seems
to think you're funny. I don't.

461
00:41:30,645 --> 00:41:34,732
- I want you to drop this affair.
- I beg your pardon, sir, is that an order?

462
00:41:34,982 --> 00:41:38,695
Colonel Dax, when this mess
is cleaned up, I'll break you.

463
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,073
I'll find an excuse and break you
to the ranks. I'll ruin you!

464
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,328
It'll be just what you deserve, showing so
little loyalty to your commanding officer.

465
00:41:47,495 --> 00:41:49,747
That's all, Colonel.

466
00:42:12,353 --> 00:42:15,106
General Mireau feels that
the attack on the Ant Hill

467
00:42:15,189 --> 00:42:19,110
failed because of an inadequate effort
on the part of the 1st Battalion.

468
00:42:19,277 --> 00:42:23,364
Each of you is to select one man from
your company, place him under arrest,

469
00:42:23,531 --> 00:42:27,994
and have him ready to appear before
a court martial at 1500 hours today.

470
00:42:28,202 --> 00:42:30,580
The charge is cowardice
before the enemy.

471
00:42:30,705 --> 00:42:33,624
You have your orders, gentlemen.
Let's carry them out.

472
00:42:54,145 --> 00:42:58,399
Roget killed Lejeune on that patrol,
then blackmailed me into keeping quiet!

473
00:42:58,650 --> 00:42:59,817
That's why he picked me.

474
00:43:00,026 --> 00:43:03,821
I understand your feelings, but that
has nothing to do with these charges.

475
00:43:03,946 --> 00:43:06,741
- Don't you believe me, sir?
- Yes, I do.

476
00:43:06,824 --> 00:43:10,453
But who else will?
You've got no witnesses.

477
00:43:10,578 --> 00:43:14,499
Besides, such charges against an officer
would only antagonise the court.

478
00:43:14,624 --> 00:43:18,044
When this is over, I'm going
into the story of that patrol again.

479
00:43:18,252 --> 00:43:22,006
Sir, in my case, Captain Renoir
had the sergeant draw lots.

480
00:43:22,173 --> 00:43:24,425
I was picked purely by chance.

481
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,678
You're lucky. Look at me.

482
00:43:26,886 --> 00:43:31,182
I was just picked because Captain Sancy
said I was a social undesirable.

483
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:33,685
Me, a social undesirable.

484
00:43:33,851 --> 00:43:36,270
- I didn't act like a coward!
- Neither did I!

485
00:43:36,437 --> 00:43:40,525
Gentlemen, you must understand that
the reason you were picked is immaterial.

486
00:43:40,692 --> 00:43:44,028
Whatever the reason,
you're on trial for your lives.

487
00:43:48,116 --> 00:43:53,121
Stick to the stories you've told me. Don't
let the prosecutor shake you out of it.

488
00:43:53,204 --> 00:43:56,624
You'll be soldiers in
the presence of superior officers,

489
00:43:56,791 --> 00:43:59,627
so act like what you are - soldiers.

490
00:44:00,461 --> 00:44:03,047
And brave ones at that.

491
00:44:03,131 --> 00:44:06,551
I've been in the room you'll be in.
The sun will be in your faces,

492
00:44:06,759 --> 00:44:12,140
so don't let it seem as if you're dropping
your eyes in a hangdog manner.

493
00:44:12,265 --> 00:44:14,475
When you speak,
look the judges in the eye.

494
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,645
Don't whine, plead or
make speeches - that's my job.

495
00:44:17,729 --> 00:44:21,816
Simple statements - short, but make them
so they can be heard all over the room.

496
00:44:21,899 --> 00:44:25,820
Try not to repeat yourselves.
I'll do that for you when I sum up.

497
00:44:25,987 --> 00:44:31,159
We haven't much time. The court martial
is in an hour and I've got notes to look at.

498
00:44:32,327 --> 00:44:34,329
Good luck.

499
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:36,914
Thank you, sir.

500
00:45:17,413 --> 00:45:21,125
The court martial is open.
The prisoners may be seated.

501
00:45:27,215 --> 00:45:32,387
This is a general court martial, so we shall
dispense with unnecessary formalities.

502
00:45:32,553 --> 00:45:36,057
These men are charged with
cowardice in the face of the enemy,

503
00:45:36,307 --> 00:45:39,143
and will be tried for that offence.

504
00:45:39,227 --> 00:45:43,231
- Mr Prosecutor?
- Call the accused. Private Ferol.

505
00:45:43,481 --> 00:45:47,235
Mr President, will the prosecutor
question the witnesses

506
00:45:47,318 --> 00:45:49,320
without even reading the indictment?

507
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:52,907
Please don't take up
the court's time with technicalities.

508
00:45:53,074 --> 00:45:56,828
The indictment is lengthy,
and there's no point in reading it.

509
00:45:56,995 --> 00:46:00,915
- The defence has a right to know...
- It states the accused showed cowardice

510
00:46:01,082 --> 00:46:04,419
in the face of the enemy
during the attack on the Ant Hill.

511
00:46:04,919 --> 00:46:07,505
Proceed, Mr Prosecutor.

512
00:46:08,006 --> 00:46:11,009
Call the accused, Private Ferol.

513
00:46:20,351 --> 00:46:22,353
- Private Ferol.
- Yes, sir.

514
00:46:23,271 --> 00:46:26,190
Were you in the first wave
during the attack on the Ant Hill?

515
00:46:26,357 --> 00:46:27,525
Yes, sir.

516
00:46:27,692 --> 00:46:30,611
- Did you refuse to advance?
- No, sir.

517
00:46:31,696 --> 00:46:33,948
- Did you advance?
- Yes, sir.

518
00:46:34,866 --> 00:46:39,287
- How far did you advance?
- To the middle of no-man's-land, sir.

519
00:46:40,121 --> 00:46:42,206
Then what did you do?

520
00:46:42,373 --> 00:46:46,794
- There were machine-gun bullets...
- Answer the question. What did you do?

521
00:46:47,545 --> 00:46:51,215
Well... I saw that me and Meyer...

522
00:46:51,382 --> 00:46:53,384
I didn't ask you what you saw.

523
00:46:53,551 --> 00:46:57,472
The court has no concern
with your visual experiences.

524
00:46:57,638 --> 00:46:58,639
My what, sir?

525
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:02,643
- The prisoner will reply to the question.
- Yes, sir. What question was it?

526
00:47:02,894 --> 00:47:06,648
You advanced to the middle of
no-man's-land. What did you do then?

527
00:47:06,731 --> 00:47:09,484
- Then, sir?
- Did you go back or forward?

528
00:47:09,651 --> 00:47:11,235
I went back, sir.

529
00:47:11,402 --> 00:47:13,655
In other words, Private Ferol,

530
00:47:14,989 --> 00:47:17,325
you retreated.

531
00:47:17,492 --> 00:47:19,410
Yes, sir.

532
00:47:19,577 --> 00:47:22,664
That's all.
The accused may return to his seat.

533
00:47:22,914 --> 00:47:24,832
Just a minute.

534
00:47:24,999 --> 00:47:28,670
Mr President, I'd like
to question the witness, if I may.

535
00:47:29,087 --> 00:47:31,506
- Proceed, Colonel.
- Thank you.

536
00:47:32,757 --> 00:47:37,261
Private, when you reached no-man's-land,
were you alone with Private Meyer?

537
00:47:37,512 --> 00:47:38,596
Yes, sir.

538
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:41,182
What happened to
the rest of your company?

539
00:47:41,349 --> 00:47:43,351
I don't know, sir.

540
00:47:43,518 --> 00:47:45,603
I guess they had been killed or wounded.

541
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:50,191
You found yourself in the middle of
no-man's-land alone with Private Meyer.

542
00:47:50,358 --> 00:47:53,611
Why didn't you attack
the Ant Hill single-handed?

543
00:47:57,699 --> 00:48:00,201
Why didn't you storm the Ant Hill alone?

544
00:48:00,368 --> 00:48:03,287
Just me and Meyer? You're kidding, sir.

545
00:48:03,454 --> 00:48:06,958
Yes, I'm kidding, Private Ferol.
Thank you.

546
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:10,211
- That's all.
- Why do you use this line of questioning?

547
00:48:10,628 --> 00:48:13,548
I'm attempting to indicate
the utter absurdity

548
00:48:13,715 --> 00:48:16,884
of the line of questioning
used by the prosecutor.

549
00:48:17,635 --> 00:48:18,803
Mr Prosecutor.

550
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:23,224
So you freely admit, Private Ferol,
that you retreated.

551
00:48:23,391 --> 00:48:26,060
Yes, sir. Me and Meyer both.

552
00:48:26,144 --> 00:48:28,396
I knew we should have took Ant Hill,

553
00:48:28,563 --> 00:48:30,815
but we came on back.

554
00:48:32,317 --> 00:48:34,652
That's all.

555
00:48:35,987 --> 00:48:38,239
The accused may return to his seat.

556
00:48:48,666 --> 00:48:51,002
Private Arnaud.

557
00:48:51,169 --> 00:48:53,338
- Did you advance?
- Yes, sir.

558
00:48:53,504 --> 00:48:57,258
until I was ordered back
to the trenches by Captain Renoir.

559
00:48:57,425 --> 00:49:01,346
- How far did you advance?
- Into the wire, sir.

560
00:49:01,512 --> 00:49:05,266
The... enemy wire, I suppose?

561
00:49:05,433 --> 00:49:07,435
No, sir. It was our wire.

562
00:49:08,936 --> 00:49:14,108
You mean to tell me that you didn't
advance any further than our wire?

563
00:49:14,776 --> 00:49:17,111
No, sir, I didn't.

564
00:49:17,362 --> 00:49:20,948
How far would you say that was?
How many metres?

565
00:49:21,783 --> 00:49:23,618
I advanced as far as I could.

566
00:49:24,285 --> 00:49:28,122
- How many metres?
- Not many.

567
00:49:30,291 --> 00:49:32,293
Not many.

568
00:49:34,796 --> 00:49:36,631
Now, Private Arnaud.

569
00:49:36,798 --> 00:49:44,138
Before you were ordered back, did you
urge your fellow soldiers forward?

570
00:49:44,305 --> 00:49:47,642
Most of them were dead or wounded
before they'd taken three steps.

571
00:49:47,809 --> 00:49:51,729
- Reply to the question.
- I didn't urge them on, no, sir.

572
00:49:55,483 --> 00:49:57,485
Thank you.

573
00:50:03,241 --> 00:50:05,660
Private Arnaud.

574
00:50:05,827 --> 00:50:07,829
At ease, please.

575
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:13,084
Aside from your sad failure
to give throat to spirited battle cries,

576
00:50:13,334 --> 00:50:16,671
did your behaviour differ from
that of other men in your company?

577
00:50:16,838 --> 00:50:19,257
Objection.
That's a matter of conjecture.

578
00:50:19,757 --> 00:50:21,592
Sustained.

579
00:50:24,679 --> 00:50:27,432
Did any men in your company
get beyond our wire?

580
00:50:27,932 --> 00:50:28,933
No, sir.

581
00:50:29,267 --> 00:50:31,269
Have you been designated a coward

582
00:50:31,352 --> 00:50:34,188
simply because you drew
a slip of paper marked "X"?

583
00:50:34,355 --> 00:50:37,191
- Yes, sir.
- I don't see that that's significant.

584
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:40,945
It's accepted practice in the French army
to pick examples by lot.

585
00:50:41,112 --> 00:50:43,614
This entire company
advanced only a few metres,

586
00:50:43,781 --> 00:50:46,617
so picking by lot
was eminently fair in this case.

587
00:50:46,784 --> 00:50:53,207
This soldier has distinguished himself in
some of the bloodiest battles of the war.

588
00:50:53,374 --> 00:50:56,210
With your permission,
I'll read citations for bravery

589
00:50:56,377 --> 00:50:59,630
that he's already earned
on two occasions.

590
00:50:59,797 --> 00:51:04,552
- First, citations in the orders in the army...
- That's immaterial, Colonel.

591
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:09,057
The accused is not being tried for former
bravery, but for his recent cowardice.

592
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,142
Medals are no defence.

593
00:51:13,811 --> 00:51:18,232
- May I call witnesses to his character?
- You may not.

594
00:51:18,483 --> 00:51:23,488
But you may call witnesses to the effect
that he reached the German wire.

595
00:51:23,655 --> 00:51:26,491
Mr President, no one
in the entire regiment

596
00:51:26,658 --> 00:51:29,827
got anywhere near the German wire,
including myself.

597
00:51:30,495 --> 00:51:32,747
Call the next accused...

598
00:51:32,914 --> 00:51:35,083
if you're through, Colonel.

599
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,585
Thank you.

600
00:51:37,752 --> 00:51:40,004
The prisoner may return to his seat.

601
00:51:48,346 --> 00:51:50,598
So you never even left the trenches?

602
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:55,436
- No, sir.
- That's all.

603
00:51:56,354 --> 00:52:00,692
Corporal Paris, why didn't
you leave the trenches?

604
00:52:02,026 --> 00:52:06,030
Major Vignon was shot and he fell back
on top of me, sir, and knocked me cold.

605
00:52:06,614 --> 00:52:10,618
Were you lying unconscious in
the trenches during the entire attack?

606
00:52:10,785 --> 00:52:11,703
Yes, sir.

607
00:52:13,287 --> 00:52:14,288
That's all.

608
00:52:14,706 --> 00:52:17,041
Have you any witnesses to that?

609
00:52:17,208 --> 00:52:20,211
No, sir. I guess everybody
was too busy to notice me,

610
00:52:20,378 --> 00:52:22,380
and so many others were lying dead.

611
00:52:22,463 --> 00:52:26,551
- But you have no witnesses?
- No, sir.

612
00:52:26,718 --> 00:52:29,387
I only have a rather large cut
on my head, sir.

613
00:52:29,721 --> 00:52:33,307
That could have been self-inflicted later.

614
00:52:33,474 --> 00:52:35,893
Thank you. You may stand down.

615
00:52:41,816 --> 00:52:44,319
Mr Prosecutor,
you can make your plea now.

616
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:51,659
Gentlemen of the court,

617
00:52:52,744 --> 00:52:55,663
this case speaks for itself.

618
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:59,917
All of us witnessed
the regrettable attack yesterday morning.

619
00:53:02,253 --> 00:53:05,089
And I submit that that attack

620
00:53:06,758 --> 00:53:09,093
was a stain on the flag of France,

621
00:53:10,261 --> 00:53:15,600
a blot on the honour of every man,
woman and child in the French nation.

622
00:53:18,519 --> 00:53:26,611
It is to us that the sad,
distressing, repellent duty falls.

623
00:53:26,778 --> 00:53:30,031
Gentlemen, I ask this court

624
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:33,868
to find the accused guilty,

625
00:53:37,538 --> 00:53:41,876
and impose the penalties prescribed
by the code of military justice.

626
00:53:45,713 --> 00:53:47,131
Thank you, Mr Prosecutor.

627
00:53:48,549 --> 00:53:50,968
Colonel, would you like
to make your plea?

628
00:54:01,062 --> 00:54:05,233
Gentlemen, there are times when I'm
ashamed to belong to the human race,

629
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,402
and this is one such occasion.

630
00:54:09,988 --> 00:54:13,408
It's impossible for me to summarise
the case for the defence,

631
00:54:13,658 --> 00:54:17,412
since the court never allowed me
an opportunity to present my case.

632
00:54:17,495 --> 00:54:21,082
Are you protesting
the authenticity of this court?

633
00:54:23,167 --> 00:54:28,089
Yes, sir. I protest against being
prevented from introducing evidence

634
00:54:28,256 --> 00:54:31,009
that I consider vital to the defence.

635
00:54:31,175 --> 00:54:34,095
The prosecution presented no witnesses.

636
00:54:34,262 --> 00:54:38,850
There has never been a written indictment
of charges made against the defendants.

637
00:54:38,933 --> 00:54:41,686
And lastly, I protest against the fact

638
00:54:41,853 --> 00:54:45,606
that no stenographic records
of this trial have been kept.

639
00:54:54,282 --> 00:54:58,870
The attack yesterday morning
is no stain on the honour of France,

640
00:55:00,955 --> 00:55:04,292
and certainly no disgrace
to the fighting men of this nation.

641
00:55:04,375 --> 00:55:09,380
But this court martial
is such a stain, and such a disgrace.

642
00:55:09,547 --> 00:55:13,634
The case made against these men
is a mockery of all human justice.

643
00:55:14,302 --> 00:55:18,139
Gentlemen of the court,
to find these men guilty

644
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:24,646
will be a crime to haunt each of you
till the day you die.

645
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:32,737
I can't believe that
the noblest impulse of man,

646
00:55:33,905 --> 00:55:37,659
his compassion for another,
can be completely dead here.

647
00:55:39,327 --> 00:55:41,663
Therefore, I humbly beg you,

648
00:55:43,831 --> 00:55:45,833
show mercy to these men.

649
00:55:52,924 --> 00:55:57,261
The accused will be escorted back to
the guardroom. The hearing is closed.

650
00:55:57,345 --> 00:55:59,847
The court will now retire to deliberate.

651
00:56:00,014 --> 00:56:05,269
There will be a guard of six men
under arms. Two men to each prisoner.

652
00:56:05,436 --> 00:56:08,106
Any sign of trouble,
the prisoners will be covered.

653
00:56:08,272 --> 00:56:11,859
If the trouble doesn't subside at once,
the prisoner will be shot.

654
00:56:12,026 --> 00:56:15,530
It must all go off without a hitch
and with the least possible delay.

655
00:56:15,613 --> 00:56:19,283
It shouldn't be hurried,
but there must be no fumbling around.

656
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:22,453
I've been put in charge
and made personally responsible

657
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:25,540
for any lack of order, or for any mistakes.

658
00:56:25,707 --> 00:56:30,795
But you can take it from me that I shall
pass on any blame, and with interest,

659
00:56:30,878 --> 00:56:33,381
to any one of you who fails in his duties.

660
00:56:34,632 --> 00:56:37,385
Execution will take place at seven o'clock,

661
00:56:37,552 --> 00:56:40,555
according to the verdict
of the court martial.

662
00:56:42,056 --> 00:56:44,892
Detail, attention! Dismissed!

663
00:56:58,823 --> 00:57:00,908
This is compliments of General Mireau.

664
00:57:01,075 --> 00:57:03,161
- Duck.
- Well, tell him thanks

665
00:57:03,328 --> 00:57:05,997
Don't blame me, soldier.

666
00:57:06,164 --> 00:57:08,416
Are we supposed to eat
this with our fingers?

667
00:57:08,499 --> 00:57:12,337
The guard says you can't
have any knives or forks.

668
00:57:12,503 --> 00:57:14,589
Is this supposed to be our last meal?

669
00:57:14,672 --> 00:57:18,176
It isn't supposedto be our last meal.
It is our last meal.

670
00:57:18,343 --> 00:57:20,762
This duck is terrific.

671
00:57:21,012 --> 00:57:23,348
Do you suppose they put
anything in the food?

672
00:57:23,514 --> 00:57:26,017
First they poison us, then they shoot us?

673
00:57:28,936 --> 00:57:32,607
- I think they put something in it.
- Like what?

674
00:57:32,774 --> 00:57:36,861
Like, uh... something
to make us groggy or something.

675
00:57:37,028 --> 00:57:39,030
What would be wrong
with that if they did?

676
00:57:39,197 --> 00:57:44,118
Maybe nothing for you, but I'm gonna get
out of this, and I don't wanna be drugged.

677
00:57:44,285 --> 00:57:48,790
How are you gonna get out?
Chew your way through that stone wall?

678
00:57:48,956 --> 00:57:51,125
Colonel Dax. He'll see us through.

679
00:57:53,628 --> 00:57:56,964
We gotta get outta here.
They're gonna kill us in a few hours.

680
00:57:57,131 --> 00:58:00,468
- Have you got an idea?
- No, but there's gotta be a way.

681
00:58:01,719 --> 00:58:04,055
How many guards
do you think they've got?

682
00:58:04,222 --> 00:58:07,308
They may have a couple of squads.
That's what it sounded like.

683
00:58:07,475 --> 00:58:10,728
- Maybe they're some of our friends.
- That's the 3rd Battalion.

684
00:58:10,979 --> 00:58:14,065
Anyway, right now we have no friends.

685
00:58:14,232 --> 00:58:17,151
Why kid yourself?
We're not gonna get out of this.

686
00:58:17,318 --> 00:58:21,322
Maybe you're not, but I am.
I'll guarantee you of that.

687
00:58:22,156 --> 00:58:24,575
See that cockroach?

688
00:58:24,742 --> 00:58:27,745
Tomorrow morning,
we'll be dead and it'll be alive.

689
00:58:27,912 --> 00:58:31,916
It'll have more contact
with my wife and child than I will.

690
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,836
I'll be nothing and it'll be alive.

691
00:58:35,003 --> 00:58:37,005
Now you've got the edge on him.

692
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:45,013
Good evening, my sons. I'm Father Dupré.

693
00:58:48,349 --> 00:58:50,268
Is there any news?

694
00:58:50,351 --> 00:58:54,605
I'm afraid I bring you very bad news. You
must prepare yourselves for the worst.

695
00:58:54,856 --> 00:58:57,442
- Colonel Dax asked me to tell you.
- Oh, mercy, no!

696
00:58:57,608 --> 00:59:00,528
He's been in telephone contact
with army headquarters,

697
00:59:00,695 --> 00:59:04,365
but unable to speak to General Broulard
or to anyone in authority.

698
00:59:04,782 --> 00:59:07,702
The same way at Division.
No one wants to be found.

699
00:59:07,952 --> 00:59:10,204
- How much time do we have?
- You have plenty.

700
00:59:10,371 --> 00:59:13,541
Certainly more than enough
to prepare yourselves.

701
00:59:13,958 --> 00:59:19,047
In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.

702
00:59:19,213 --> 00:59:21,132
Amen.

703
00:59:30,058 --> 00:59:33,394
- Father, will you take this letter for me?
- Of course, my son.

704
00:59:33,561 --> 00:59:37,315
It's to my wife. She won't understand
this, and I tried to explain it to her.

705
00:59:37,565 --> 00:59:42,320
I'll see that she gets it.
Do you want me to hear your confession?

706
00:59:42,737 --> 00:59:46,741
Well, Father, to tell you the truth,
I'm not very religious.

707
00:59:46,908 --> 00:59:49,410
I know you're trying to help
and I appreciate it,

708
00:59:49,577 --> 00:59:52,497
but if I started praying now
I'd feel like a hypocrite.

709
00:59:52,747 --> 00:59:57,168
That's an error, my son. God is
always ready to listen to your prayers.

710
01:00:00,338 --> 01:00:03,758
All right, Father.
Will you please hear my confession now?

711
01:00:03,925 --> 01:00:06,094
Yes.

712
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:11,015
Have faith in your Creator, my son.
Death comes to us all.

713
01:00:11,182 --> 01:00:13,518
The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

714
01:00:13,685 --> 01:00:18,606
That's really deep. "Death
comes to us all". That really is deep.

715
01:00:18,773 --> 01:00:22,026
Ferol, what's the matter?
Afraid your luck won't hold out?

716
01:00:22,193 --> 01:00:26,030
This is my religion.
O great bottle, forgive me my sins,

717
01:00:26,197 --> 01:00:29,784
for now I lay me down to sleep.
May I drink you first? Thank you. Amen.

718
01:00:29,951 --> 01:00:34,122
I understand your anguish, my son,
but you must not let it harden your heart.

719
01:00:34,288 --> 01:00:36,374
May I tell you something, Father?

720
01:00:36,624 --> 01:00:41,045
Back in my home town, there was a café
with an amusing sign over the bar.

721
01:00:41,212 --> 01:00:46,718
It read "Do not be afraid to ask for credit
for our way of refusing is very polite."

722
01:00:46,884 --> 01:00:50,638
- Come on, Arnaud. You're drunk.
- Oh, Paris, leave me alone.

723
01:00:50,888 --> 01:00:53,725
Get out of here with
your sanctimonious pat answers!

724
01:00:53,975 --> 01:00:57,145
- Are you here to torture us?!
- No, to help you with all my power.

725
01:00:57,312 --> 01:00:59,314
You have no power!

726
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:01,899
- God has power.
- Does he? What a laugh!

727
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:04,736
- You can be saved.
- Saved? I'll be saved?

728
01:01:07,822 --> 01:01:10,158
Cut it out, Arnaud!

729
01:01:10,325 --> 01:01:12,160
Arnaud!

730
01:01:13,244 --> 01:01:14,245
Arnaud.

731
01:01:20,668 --> 01:01:22,670
Father, get a doctor. Quick.

732
01:01:32,597 --> 01:01:34,599
That should keep him quiet long enough.

733
01:01:34,766 --> 01:01:37,602
That's a nasty skull fracture.
He may not last the night.

734
01:01:37,769 --> 01:01:41,189
- What are we supposed to do with him?
- You can tie him to a stretcher

735
01:01:41,356 --> 01:01:43,358
so you can tilt him vertically.

736
01:01:43,441 --> 01:01:46,361
Surely they won't execute
a man in that condition?

737
01:01:46,527 --> 01:01:50,948
I'm sorry, Father. The sentence will be
carried out. I checked with the general.

738
01:01:51,115 --> 01:01:55,119
If he's alive in the morning,
pinch his cheeks before you take him out.

739
01:01:55,286 --> 01:01:57,955
It may open his eyes.
The general wants him conscious.

740
01:01:59,207 --> 01:02:01,125
Yes?

741
01:02:04,212 --> 01:02:07,048
- Lieutenant Roget reporting, sir.
- Come in.

742
01:02:08,216 --> 01:02:10,885
Sergeant Boulanger
said you wanted to see me, sir.

743
01:02:10,968 --> 01:02:15,890
Yes, Lieutenant. Looks as if we have
a pretty unpleasant thing on our hands.

744
01:02:16,057 --> 01:02:19,060
- You mean the execution, sir.
- Yes, I mean the execution.

745
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:22,647
- Yes, sir. It's very unfortunate.
- "Very unfortunate."

746
01:02:22,814 --> 01:02:26,818
- That's just how I feel about it.
- None of us are happy about it, sir.

747
01:02:26,985 --> 01:02:29,904
How did you happen
to pick Corporal Paris?

748
01:02:30,071 --> 01:02:32,323
Well, I had to pick somebody, sir.

749
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:36,411
Yes, you did. You had no personal
motive in picking Paris, did you?

750
01:02:36,494 --> 01:02:38,329
Oh, no, sir.

751
01:02:38,413 --> 01:02:41,582
You picked him because
he was a coward, didn't you?

752
01:02:42,917 --> 01:02:45,336
Did you or didn't you?

753
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:47,505
Oh, yes, sir, I did.

754
01:02:49,173 --> 01:02:53,761
- Like you say, someone had to be picked.
- It was quite a problem, sir.

755
01:02:53,928 --> 01:02:56,514
I have a similar problem.
I have to pick someone

756
01:02:56,681 --> 01:02:58,599
to be in charge of the firing squad.

757
01:02:58,766 --> 01:03:01,853
Do you have any objections
to taking the job?

758
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:04,689
- Me, sir?
- Yes, you.

759
01:03:07,108 --> 01:03:09,193
What's the matter? Don't you feel well?

760
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,196
No... Yeah, I feel all right, sir.
It's just that I...

761
01:03:12,447 --> 01:03:16,117
- Would you like me to open a window?
- No, sir.

762
01:03:16,951 --> 01:03:21,372
Well, it's... just that I've never been
in charge of a firing squad before, sir.

763
01:03:21,622 --> 01:03:27,045
Oh, there's nothing to it. First, you help
the sergeant tie the men to the posts.

764
01:03:27,211 --> 01:03:32,133
Of course, you offer the men blindfolds
and... if they want them, you tie them on.

765
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:37,805
You take your position with the firing
squad, raise your sword - ready, aim, fire.

766
01:03:38,723 --> 01:03:41,726
Then you draw your revolver out,
you walk forward,

767
01:03:41,893 --> 01:03:44,228
and put a bullet through each man's head.

768
01:03:45,563 --> 01:03:48,900
Sir, I request that I be
excused from this duty.

769
01:03:49,484 --> 01:03:51,569
- Request denied.
- Colonel...

770
01:03:51,736 --> 01:03:55,239
You've got the job. It's all yours.
That's all, Lieutenant.

771
01:03:55,406 --> 01:03:57,408
- Colonel, if you could...
- That's all!

772
01:03:57,575 --> 01:03:59,994
Yes?

773
01:04:00,161 --> 01:04:03,331
- Ex cuse me, sir. Colonel Dax?
- Yes?

774
01:04:03,498 --> 01:04:06,000
My name is Rousseau, sir.
Captain of artillery.

775
01:04:06,167 --> 01:04:08,336
What is it, Captain?

776
01:04:13,675 --> 01:04:18,429
I have something to tell you, sir, that may
have a great bearing on the court martial.

777
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,014
Come in, Captain.

778
01:05:14,902 --> 01:05:17,405
- Colonel, good evening!
- Good evening, sir.

779
01:05:17,572 --> 01:05:20,658
- Good evening. Come and sit down.
- Thank you, sir.

780
01:05:20,825 --> 01:05:24,662
- I'm sorry to intrude on you in this way.
- I'm always delighted to see you.

781
01:05:24,829 --> 01:05:27,498
- Will you have a cigar?
- No, thank you.

782
01:05:27,582 --> 01:05:31,085
- Well, I...
- I think you'll find it delicious.

783
01:05:31,252 --> 01:05:33,755
I apologise for not
inviting you to the party,

784
01:05:33,921 --> 01:05:37,175
but I'm afraid that it's a dress affair.

785
01:05:37,342 --> 01:05:42,513
Thank you, sir, but I must confess
that this is not entirely a social visit.

786
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:46,517
Oh, come, Dax, let's not go
over all that ground again.

787
01:05:48,102 --> 01:05:53,858
But judging by the casualties, the efforts
of your regiment must have been notable.

788
01:05:53,941 --> 01:05:57,695
How can you understand that
and allow these men to be shot?

789
01:05:57,862 --> 01:06:00,365
You're taking a rather simple view of this.

790
01:06:00,531 --> 01:06:05,870
The attack was impossible. The
general staff must have known that.

791
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:10,124
Colonel Dax, we think we're doing
a good job running the war.

792
01:06:10,208 --> 01:06:12,877
You must be aware that
the general staff is subject

793
01:06:13,044 --> 01:06:16,464
to all kinds of unfair pressures
from newspapers and politicians.

794
01:06:16,631 --> 01:06:19,384
Maybe the attack against
the Ant Hill was impossible.

795
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:22,804
Perhaps we made an error of judgment.
On the other hand,

796
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:27,141
if your men had been a little more daring,
they might have taken it. Who knows?

797
01:06:27,308 --> 01:06:32,230
Why should we have to bear any more
criticism for the failure than we have to?

798
01:06:32,563 --> 01:06:35,984
Aside from the fact that many
of your men never left the trenches,

799
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:38,486
there's the question of the troops' morale.

800
01:06:38,653 --> 01:06:40,405
- The troops' morale?
- Certainly.

801
01:06:40,571 --> 01:06:43,408
These executions will be
a tonic for the division.

802
01:06:43,574 --> 01:06:47,996
Few things are more encouraging and
stimulating than seeing someone else die.

803
01:06:48,162 --> 01:06:51,082
- I never thought of that, sir.
- Troops are like children.

804
01:06:51,499 --> 01:06:55,753
Just as a child wants his father to be firm,
troops crave discipline.

805
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,590
One way to maintain discipline
is to shoot a man now and then.

806
01:06:59,757 --> 01:07:05,346
May I ask... do you sincerely believe
all the things you've just said?

807
01:07:10,351 --> 01:07:15,773
It's been a pleasure discussing this with
you, but I'd better get back to my guests.

808
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:18,943
Forgive me for having
kept you from your party.

809
01:07:20,945 --> 01:07:24,365
By the way, sir,
have you heard that General Mireau

810
01:07:24,532 --> 01:07:27,785
ordered his own battery
commander, Captain Rousseau,

811
01:07:27,952 --> 01:07:31,205
to open fire on his own positions
during the attack?

812
01:07:34,709 --> 01:07:37,879
Of course, the captain refused
without a written order.

813
01:07:38,046 --> 01:07:42,216
But General Mireau demanded that
he commence firing on our own trenches.

814
01:07:42,383 --> 01:07:44,719
Rousseau refused
without an order in writing,

815
01:07:44,886 --> 01:07:50,975
but again he was ordered, and again
he refused... all in front of witnesses.

816
01:07:51,142 --> 01:07:53,811
Do you actually believe
this fantastic story?

817
01:07:53,978 --> 01:07:57,899
Here are copies of the sworn statements
from all the principals involved.

818
01:07:58,066 --> 01:08:01,736
Battery Commander Rousseau,
Captain Nichols, the artillery spotter,

819
01:08:01,903 --> 01:08:05,657
the telephone clerk, and, uh...
my own deposition.

820
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:09,911
What has all this got to do with
the charge against the prisoners?

821
01:08:10,078 --> 01:08:13,498
A general in a tantrum
over the failure of an impossible attack

822
01:08:13,665 --> 01:08:16,417
orders his artillery to fire on his own men.

823
01:08:17,502 --> 01:08:20,088
Now, the same officer on the same day

824
01:08:20,254 --> 01:08:25,343
orders a court martial in which
three of his men are sentenced to be shot.

825
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:30,181
General, what would your newspapers
and your politicians do with that?

826
01:08:31,683 --> 01:08:33,935
Colonel Dax,
are you trying to blackmail me?

827
01:08:34,268 --> 01:08:38,106
Sir, that's an ugly word,
but you are in a difficult position.

828
01:08:38,356 --> 01:08:42,944
Too much has happened. Someone's
got to be hurt. The only question is who.

829
01:08:44,529 --> 01:08:47,532
General Mireau's assault
on the Ant Hill failed.

830
01:08:47,699 --> 01:08:50,618
His order to fire on
his own troops was refused,

831
01:08:51,536 --> 01:08:55,873
but his attempt to murder three innocent
men to protect his own reputation

832
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,459
will be prevented by the general staff.

833
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:09,887
Will you pardon me, Colonel Dax?
I've been rude to my guests too long.

834
01:09:38,548 --> 01:09:40,550
Detail, halt!

835
01:09:42,051 --> 01:09:44,053
Order arms!

836
01:09:44,637 --> 01:09:46,639
Fall out.

837
01:10:12,081 --> 01:10:14,250
Courage, my sons. The worst is over.

838
01:10:26,346 --> 01:10:29,015
Morning, Paris.

839
01:10:29,098 --> 01:10:31,351
Morning, Sergeant.

840
01:10:31,434 --> 01:10:33,937
- How are you today?
- Not too bad.

841
01:10:34,938 --> 01:10:37,106
How are you?

842
01:10:38,775 --> 01:10:41,194
You missed some good chow
in here last night.

843
01:10:41,361 --> 01:10:43,530
What'd you have?

844
01:10:46,032 --> 01:10:48,701
Have you got a drink for us?

845
01:10:48,952 --> 01:10:51,287
Take a swig of this.

846
01:10:54,624 --> 01:10:57,043
It just occurred to me... a funny thing.

847
01:10:58,294 --> 01:11:03,216
I haven't had one sexual thought since the
court martial. It's extraordinary, isn't it?

848
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:07,971
Pull yourself together. Act like a man.

849
01:11:08,054 --> 01:11:13,142
Paris, are you listening to me? There'll be
dignitaries and newspaper men out there.

850
01:11:13,393 --> 01:11:16,229
You've got family.
How do you wanna be remembered?

851
01:11:16,312 --> 01:11:17,730
I don't wanna die.

852
01:11:17,897 --> 01:11:20,316
Many of us'll join you
before this war's over.

853
01:11:20,483 --> 01:11:22,986
I don't care. I don't wanna die.

854
01:11:24,237 --> 01:11:28,241
- Please save me, Sergeant.
- I can't save you. No one can now.

855
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:32,912
This is the last decision
you can make on earth.

856
01:11:33,079 --> 01:11:36,165
You can act like a man,
or we'll have to drag you out of here.

857
01:11:36,332 --> 01:11:39,335
In the end, it'll all be the same.
It's up to you.

858
01:11:56,019 --> 01:12:00,857
Let's get busy. You and Ferol, take your
coats off. It's no use hanging around here.

859
01:12:18,958 --> 01:12:21,544
With the help of thy grace, to do penance,

860
01:12:21,711 --> 01:12:23,671
and to amend my life.

861
01:12:31,554 --> 01:12:34,015
Why do I have to die, Father?

862
01:12:36,976 --> 01:12:40,146
Why do I have to die, Father?
I didn't do anything.

863
01:12:40,271 --> 01:12:43,233
We do not question
the will of God, my son.

864
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:47,612
But I fought, I fought!
I fought on the battlefield.

865
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:51,282
Why don't they die?
Why don't you put them to death?

866
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:55,662
You showed courage in the face of the
enemy. Show it before your own troops.

867
01:12:55,828 --> 01:12:58,164
But I'm scared, I'm scared.

868
01:12:59,999 --> 01:13:02,502
Oh, Father, I'm scared.

869
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:06,089
Courage. Brace yourself, man.

870
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:17,767
He said "This day thou shalt
be with me in paradise."

871
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:20,103
- Really, Father?
- Yes.

872
01:13:20,353 --> 01:13:22,605
Really, Father?

873
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:25,942
I'll never see my wife again.

874
01:13:29,028 --> 01:13:31,698
I'll never see nobody again, Father.

875
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:34,367
Courage, man. Brace yourself.

876
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:37,161
- I can't help it!
- Brace yourself.

877
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:39,956
I can't help it, Father.

878
01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:43,918
Oh, Christ, Christ.

879
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:47,881
Strengthen me, God.
Please strengthen me.

880
01:14:14,824 --> 01:14:16,993
Secure prisoners!

881
01:14:19,913 --> 01:14:21,664
Detail, attention!

882
01:14:21,831 --> 01:14:23,833
Forward... march!

883
01:14:32,926 --> 01:14:35,011
Detail...

884
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:38,014
halt!

885
01:14:38,181 --> 01:14:40,183
Left... face!

886
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:16,553
In the name of the French people,

887
01:15:17,554 --> 01:15:23,393
Corporal Phillip Paris, Private Maurice
Ferol, and Private Pierre Arnaud

888
01:15:23,518 --> 01:15:25,979
of the 701st Regiment,

889
01:15:26,145 --> 01:15:29,983
having been found guilty of cowardice
in the face of the enemy,

890
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:34,487
are to be executed
by rifle fire immediately,

891
01:15:34,654 --> 01:15:38,616
in accordance with the judgment
of the military court martial.

892
01:15:44,247 --> 01:15:46,332
Right face!

893
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,836
Forward march!

894
01:16:08,521 --> 01:16:10,982
Do you want a blindfold?

895
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:14,110
Yes, Lieutenant, please.

896
01:16:19,282 --> 01:16:21,284
I don't wanna die.

897
01:16:34,714 --> 01:16:36,883
Do... do you want a blindfold?

898
01:16:37,717 --> 01:16:39,552
No.

899
01:16:40,678 --> 01:16:42,639
I'm sorry.

900
01:17:20,593 --> 01:17:22,679
Ready!

901
01:17:24,931 --> 01:17:26,266
Aim!

902
01:17:28,518 --> 01:17:30,520
Fire!

903
01:17:33,773 --> 01:17:35,984
I'm awfully glad you could be there,
George.

904
01:17:36,109 --> 01:17:41,114
This sort of thing is always rather grim,
but this one had a kind of splendour to it.

905
01:17:41,197 --> 01:17:44,367
I have never seen an affair
of this sort handled any better.

906
01:17:44,617 --> 01:17:46,536
The men died wonderfully.

907
01:17:46,619 --> 01:17:49,998
One of them could have done something
that would leave a bad taste.

908
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:53,877
This time you couldn't ask for better.

909
01:17:54,377 --> 01:17:55,879
Yes?

910
01:17:57,213 --> 01:17:59,632
- Yes, Colonel?
- You wanted to see me, sir.

911
01:17:59,799 --> 01:18:03,011
Oh, yes, yes!
Come in, Colonel, and sit down.

912
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:07,390
Colonel Dax. Your men died very well.

913
01:18:11,227 --> 01:18:13,980
- Would you like some coffee, Colonel?
- No, thank you.

914
01:18:14,230 --> 01:18:17,400
By the way, I've been told
that you ordered your artillery

915
01:18:17,483 --> 01:18:21,404
to fire on your own men
during the attack on the Ant Hill.

916
01:18:22,488 --> 01:18:25,491
I did what? Who told you that?

917
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:28,745
Colonel Dax came to me
last night with the story.

918
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:35,168
Colonel Dax, I've always known
that you were a disloyal officer,

919
01:18:35,335 --> 01:18:38,671
but I never dreamed that you
would stoop to anything this low.

920
01:18:38,838 --> 01:18:43,176
General, I have sworn statements from
Captain Nichols, your artillery spotter,

921
01:18:43,259 --> 01:18:45,803
Captain Rousseau,
the battery commander.

922
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:48,348
I think it's infamous. Absolutely infamous.

923
01:18:48,431 --> 01:18:50,600
Then there's no truth in the charge?

924
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:53,102
I don't see how you can even ask me that.

925
01:18:53,186 --> 01:18:55,522
You cannot imagine
how glad I am to hear that.

926
01:18:55,605 --> 01:18:58,274
I'm certain that
you'll come through it all right.

927
01:18:58,441 --> 01:19:00,777
- Through what?
- There'll have to be an inquiry.

928
01:19:01,027 --> 01:19:03,613
- An inquiry?
- These things never amount to much.

929
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:05,365
- The public forgets.
- Public?

930
01:19:05,615 --> 01:19:07,450
You have the right to clear your name.

931
01:19:07,617 --> 01:19:12,205
You cannot allow such insinuations
against your character to go undenied.

932
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:15,208
So that's it.

933
01:19:16,209 --> 01:19:18,127
You're making me the goat -

934
01:19:18,294 --> 01:19:21,965
the only completely innocent man
in this whole affair.

935
01:19:25,635 --> 01:19:29,055
I have only one last thing
to say to you, George.

936
01:19:29,222 --> 01:19:32,559
The man you stabbed in the back
is a soldier.

937
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:46,155
Well... It had to be done.

938
01:19:46,322 --> 01:19:49,659
France cannot afford to have
fools guiding her military destiny.

939
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:52,996
I'm grateful to you for bringing
the matter to my attention.

940
01:19:53,162 --> 01:19:56,499
Colonel Dax, how would you like
General Mireau's job?

941
01:19:58,334 --> 01:20:00,670
- His what, sir?
- His job.

942
01:20:01,921 --> 01:20:04,257
Let me get this straight, sir.

943
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:07,260
You're offering me
General Mireau's command?

944
01:20:07,427 --> 01:20:10,013
Come, Colonel Dax,
don't overdo the surprise.

945
01:20:10,179 --> 01:20:14,517
You've been after the job from the start.
We all know that, my boy.

946
01:20:14,684 --> 01:20:17,562
I may be many things, sir,
but I'm not your boy.

947
01:20:17,687 --> 01:20:20,523
I didn't mean to imply
any biological relationship.

948
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:24,277
- I'm not your boy in any sense.
- Are you trying to provoke me, Colonel?

949
01:20:24,444 --> 01:20:26,696
It would be a pity to lose your promotion -

950
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:30,074
a promotion you have
so very carefully planned for.

951
01:20:32,368 --> 01:20:36,039
Sir, would you like me to suggest
what you can do with that promotion?

952
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:37,373
Colonel Dax!

953
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:41,794
You will apologise at once, or else
you'll be placed under arrest!

954
01:20:41,878 --> 01:20:45,673
I apologise for not being
entirely honest with you.

955
01:20:45,882 --> 01:20:49,552
I apologise for not
revealing my true feelings.

956
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:54,724
I apologise for not telling you sooner that
you are a degenerate, sadistic old man.

957
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:58,895
And you can go to hell before
I apologise to you now or ever again!

958
01:21:01,147 --> 01:21:03,233
Colonel Dax,

959
01:21:03,399 --> 01:21:05,652
you're a disappointment to me.

960
01:21:05,818 --> 01:21:09,697
You have spoiled the keenness of
your mind by wallowing in sentimentality.

961
01:21:09,906 --> 01:21:11,908
You really did want to save those men,

962
01:21:12,075 --> 01:21:14,827
and you were not angling
for Mireau's command.

963
01:21:14,911 --> 01:21:18,665
You're an idealist, and I pity you,
as I would the village idiot.

964
01:21:18,831 --> 01:21:21,125
We're fighting a war,
a war we've got to win.

965
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:23,336
Those men didn't fight, so they were shot.

966
01:21:23,586 --> 01:21:27,882
You bring charges against General
Mireau, so I insist that he answer them.

967
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:30,343
Wherein have I done wrong?

968
01:21:33,137 --> 01:21:36,307
Because you don't know
the answer to that question...

969
01:21:38,101 --> 01:21:40,103
I pity you.

970
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:08,464
Thank you.

971
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:12,051
Gentlemen, we have a little
special entertainment for you.

972
01:22:15,555 --> 01:22:18,641
Sort of a little
diversion, as it were.

973
01:22:18,808 --> 01:22:23,313
As my wife always says, what
is life without a little diversion?

974
01:22:25,648 --> 01:22:29,944
Now, gentlemen, I give you
our latest acquisition from the enemy.

975
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:35,825
From Germany, the land of the Hun.

976
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:05,939
Gentlemen, a little pearl, washed
ashore by the tide of the war.

977
01:23:10,693 --> 01:23:13,112
Sag den Herrschaften guten Tag.

978
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:15,532
Guten Tag.

979
01:23:16,032 --> 01:23:18,701
Hey, talk in a civilised language!

980
01:23:20,286 --> 01:23:22,664
It's true, the lady has her limitations.

981
01:23:22,872 --> 01:23:25,875
As a matter of fact,
she has no talent at all.

982
01:23:26,042 --> 01:23:29,963
Ex cept, that is...
Well, maybe a little natural talent.

983
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:37,762
The little lady can't dance,
she can't tell any jokes,

984
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:40,890
and she can't balance
rubber balls on her little nose.

985
01:23:41,057 --> 01:23:42,475
Ah!

986
01:23:42,642 --> 01:23:46,312
But she can sing like a bird.
She has a throat of gold.

987
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:49,566
Come on, honey!
Sing us a song! Come on!

988
01:24:07,333 --> 01:24:10,253
Louder! Louder!

989

- Yes, Sergeant?

1004
01:26:25,805 --> 01:26:29,225
We have orders to move back
to the front immediately.

1005
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:33,062
- Well, give the men a few minutes more.
- Yes, sir.
