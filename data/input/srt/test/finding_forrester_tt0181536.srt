00:03:12,935 --> 00:03:14,587
Hey, Jamal!

4
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,239
Jamal, you awake?

5
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,543
Jamal! l know you can hear me, boy.

6
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:22,587
Jamal, l'm writing all this down.

7
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:26,196
l've got that thing with your teacher
and l'm working late.

8
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:30,152
So you're gonna have to take care
of yourself for dinner, okay?

9
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,457
Okay?

10
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,848
Okay.

11
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:40,761
Hey, l thought you wanted
to get up by 7:30.

12
00:03:45,196 --> 00:03:45,326
-Play the ball.
-Ball!

13
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:46,935
-Play the ball.
-Ball!

14
00:03:53,804 --> 00:03:55,848
-You want to change things?
-Check that.

15
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:57,935
Play ball, baby. Stop crying.

16
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,848
Hold on. What up, J?
Where you been, man?

17
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:02,196
-What's up?
-Sleep, yo.

18
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,804
-Hey, what's up, man?
-Up wondering how to save your ass.

19
00:04:06,022 --> 00:04:07,848
-What are you saving?
-Hey, Damon.

20
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:09,413
Let's go.

21
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:11,978
J, break him up, man.

22
00:04:12,196 --> 00:04:14,152
Take the ball, man, okay?

23
00:04:15,283 --> 00:04:17,848
-Oh, he broke your ankles, man!
-Yeah!

24
00:04:18,543 --> 00:04:20,022
You can't give him that.

25
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,022
-You can't give him that.
-l'm awake.

26
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,717
Come on, yo.

27
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:29,239
-You got something for me?
-What you got?

28
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:31,587
Souffle, baby!

29
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:35,500
Where's the D?

30
00:04:36,891 --> 00:04:38,370
Got nothing for me, man.

31
00:04:39,065 --> 00:04:40,674
A lot of good that's doing.

32
00:04:44,587 --> 00:04:47,413
-lt's something for The Window.
-You ever seen him?

33
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,413
-The Window?
-Yeah.

34
00:04:49,587 --> 00:04:52,109
No. But he see us, man.

35
00:04:57,065 --> 00:05:00,543
Come on, what's wrong with y'all?
Y'all want to play ball?

36
00:05:02,152 --> 00:05:03,457
-All right, baby.
-Wake up.

37
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:06,413
-You got to help me out, man.
-Shake it!

38
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,978
Hip-hop, man.

39
00:05:10,283 --> 00:05:15,543
ln 1845, Poe wrote his
most famous piece, ''The Raven''...

40
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:19,935
...a poem he wrote while strung out
on coke and obsessed with death.

41
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:22,283
''The Raven'' is like the football team.

42
00:05:22,457 --> 00:05:26,370
There's a team obsessed with death.
Always get their ass kicked.

43
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:31,326
Baltimore Ravens, only pro football
team named after a classic poem.

44
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,022
Anyone read it?

45
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:37,630
''Once upon a midnight dreary

46
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:41,109
While l pondered, weak and weary....''

47
00:05:42,804 --> 00:05:44,630
Jamal, how about it?

48
00:05:47,283 --> 00:05:49,587
No, l never read it.

49
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:54,370
Okay, l need those essays
by next Tuesday.

50
00:06:00,717 --> 00:06:00,761
Yo, man, my dad saw The Window, man.

51
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,674
Yo, man, my dad saw The Window, man.

52
00:06:02,891 --> 00:06:04,239
About 20 years ago.

53
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,717
Just like a ghost, like the ones
that be in our science books.

54
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:09,978
-Just like that.
-So, what, he was white?

55
00:06:10,196 --> 00:06:11,283
Ain't milk white?

56
00:06:11,457 --> 00:06:14,283
-Ever see a ghost that wasn't white?
-Just playing.

57
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,413
l heard he killed somebody.
That's why he stays inside.

58
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:19,630
You gotta kill an army to hide here.

59
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:21,196
-True.
-Y'all play too much.

60
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:22,717
Remember Shurrita?

61
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:25,109
She used to live below The Window?

62
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:29,848
She calls me up this one night,
bugging, dog. Bugging.

63
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:34,239
Saying she heard this tapping
from upstairs by The Window's place.

64
00:06:34,543 --> 00:06:35,630
Tap...

65
00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:37,022
...tap...

66
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:38,370
...tap.

67
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:42,630
While she was on the phone,
she started screaming, dog.

68
00:06:42,848 --> 00:06:46,717
Because now the tapping made
its way down the stairs somehow.

69
00:06:46,935 --> 00:06:47,935
Tap...

70
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:51,674
-...tap, tap.
-Listen to him, fool.

71
00:06:51,848 --> 00:06:54,891
And now it was on
the other side of her door, dog.

72
00:06:55,109 --> 00:06:58,674
She could tell there was some
type of knife he was tapping with.

73
00:06:58,891 --> 00:07:01,804
Before she can even hang up,
the phone disconnected.

74
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:06,065
-That's the last time we seen her.
-Shurrita from across the street?

75
00:07:06,283 --> 00:07:09,065
Come on, man, yo.
You know that girl is a crack ho.

76
00:07:09,283 --> 00:07:10,761
No, no, she was nice.

77
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:14,065
Listen, man, all l know is
that The Window's bad news.

78
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:18,065
Rules was, you go outside,
you stay away from The Window's place.

79
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:21,891
-No, stay away from your lying ass.
-Yo, J, you believe me, right?

80
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,065
You full of shit, dog.

81
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:25,543
Damn.

82
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:28,761
So let me guess.
So you'd go up in there, right?

83
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:32,326
lt's an old man
looking out a window, man.

84
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,804
-You'll go?
-He won't go.

85
00:07:34,022 --> 00:07:36,239
-So you'll go up there?
-Let them know, J.

86
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:38,587
-He's not gonna go.
-This nigga's scared.

87
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:41,978
Yo, l got the next call.

88
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:43,891
-So?
-So....

89
00:07:44,109 --> 00:07:46,413
l dare you to go up there, right?

90
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,065
Right? Right?

91
00:07:48,283 --> 00:07:51,152
-Whatever, man. l'll go up there.
-Yeah.

92
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,370
-He's going.
-Big shot. Superman.

93
00:07:53,587 --> 00:07:55,935
-Bring it, son.
-That's my dog.

94
00:07:56,152 --> 00:07:57,543
You feel me.

95
00:07:57,761 --> 00:07:59,022
D, l believe you, dog.

96
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:01,326
Man, shut up.
Go to class or something.

97
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,674
Here, man, sit over here, son.

98
00:08:04,891 --> 00:08:07,500
Are you kidding me?
Stop playing with me.

99
00:08:07,717 --> 00:08:10,326
-lt's a vibrant thing. Go over there.
-Fine.

100
00:08:10,543 --> 00:08:12,152
Here, take your apple too.

101
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:24,065
-Ms. Joyce?
-Yeah. Hi.

102
00:09:24,283 --> 00:09:26,152
Good to see you.
Have a seat here.

103
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,500
Thank you.

104
00:09:28,717 --> 00:09:29,848
Okay.

105
00:09:30,543 --> 00:09:33,065
We got Jamal's test scores
back this week.

106
00:09:33,283 --> 00:09:35,500
-Test scores?
-Assessment tests.

107
00:09:35,674 --> 00:09:39,196
The state education department
requires all kids to take them.

108
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:41,022
He didn't tell you?

109
00:09:43,674 --> 00:09:46,804
Mrs. Wallace,
Jamal maintains a C average.

110
00:09:47,022 --> 00:09:51,500
Which means he does just enough
to get by without standing out.

111
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:56,674
Now, what makes Jamal's case
unusual are his test results.

112
00:10:02,543 --> 00:10:05,022
Oh, my God.

113
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:07,804
l see him reading all
these books all the time.

114
00:10:08,022 --> 00:10:11,022
Books l never read.
Some l never even heard of.

115
00:10:11,196 --> 00:10:14,674
And he's always writing
in his notebooks.

116
00:10:14,891 --> 00:10:17,196
Ever since his father left.

117
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,457
But that's what l see.

118
00:10:19,848 --> 00:10:23,326
All he ever talks about is basketball.

119
00:10:23,717 --> 00:10:26,239
Basketball is where
he gets his acceptance.

120
00:10:26,457 --> 00:10:29,196
Kids don't care about
what he puts down on paper.

121
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:32,370
Let's go! Between the yellow lines!
Let's go!

122
00:10:32,587 --> 00:10:33,717
Yo, T.

123
00:10:33,935 --> 00:10:34,891
What up, Fly?

124
00:10:35,109 --> 00:10:36,326
-How you?
-Maintaining.

125
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:40,283
Look, look. You looking
for tickets, little bro?

126
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Dead tonight.

127
00:10:41,717 --> 00:10:42,848
Sorry about that.

128
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:45,022
Come on, man.
We know you got tickets.

129
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:50,587
l got four words for you:
Bos-ton Red Sox. All right?

130
00:10:50,804 --> 00:10:54,717
The Yanks and Sox tickets, they damn
near been sold out almost a month.

131
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:56,283
All right, Mr. Fly?

132
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,717
And by the way, why don't you go
tell Camry boy over there...

133
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:02,804
...that he need to back up
his little cheap-ass bumper...

134
00:11:03,022 --> 00:11:04,457
...on that Mercedes there.

135
00:11:04,674 --> 00:11:08,196
Go handle that.
Let's go, Fly! Let's go!

136
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:11,717
What the hell, Jamal? Moms called.

137
00:11:12,326 --> 00:11:14,761
Tell me about the test.
What's up with that?

138
00:11:14,978 --> 00:11:17,370
-Nothing, man.
-What do you mean, nothing?

139
00:11:17,804 --> 00:11:19,543
This in the way of your plans?

140
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:22,022
Remember, it was your plan first, T.

141
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,239
Yeah, l know.
A little college ball and all.

142
00:11:25,457 --> 00:11:29,370
Then start signing checks,
solving everybody else's problems.

143
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:30,630
Look at me, though.

144
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,196
Whoa, hold a minute.

145
00:11:37,326 --> 00:11:38,761
Hold on to these.

146
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
l guess this makes it our plan now.

147
00:11:43,848 --> 00:11:46,500
-One thing.
-What up?

148
00:11:46,674 --> 00:11:49,152
Don't say nothing
about them test scores.

149
00:11:49,326 --> 00:11:51,370
Don't worry, l'm your brother, dog.

150
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:54,717
Whatever me and you discuss,
it stays between me and you.

151
00:11:55,326 --> 00:11:57,413
-Right.
-Love you, dog. All right?

152
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,761
Make sure you keep one thing in mind:

153
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:03,891
Moms knows when the game ends,
so take your ass straight home.

154
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:05,804
-Okay.
-Don't get into no trouble.

155
00:12:05,978 --> 00:12:08,196
Be careful. Stay safe, all right?

156
00:12:08,413 --> 00:12:10,500
-Love, dog.
-All right, T. Good looking.

157
00:12:10,717 --> 00:12:12,630
All right, Jamal. Be careful.

158
00:12:13,196 --> 00:12:15,326
Stink in here.

159
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:17,239
J, you see that window?

160
00:12:17,457 --> 00:12:19,457
He keeps that one cracked sometime.

161
00:12:19,674 --> 00:12:21,935
Yo, light's been out
for two hours, dog.

162
00:12:22,152 --> 00:12:23,370
You sure he asleep?

163
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:28,196
That Methuselah's like a thousand
years old. That's all they ever do.

164
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:31,761
Yo, J, man. For the reals, son,
l don't know about this.

165
00:12:31,978 --> 00:12:34,935
-l know.
-l think l'm-- Oh, shit!

166
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,413
l think l'm gonna pull the call, yo.

167
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,761
-No, yo, l got this one.
-Rats.

168
00:12:41,283 --> 00:12:42,891
All right. Yo, Fly.

169
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:45,717
Keep it.
You gotta bring something out.

170
00:12:46,283 --> 00:12:49,022
Yo, man, you hear us,
drop down, all right?

171
00:12:49,674 --> 00:12:50,978
All right.

172
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,196
Don't stay in there too long.

173
00:12:54,109 --> 00:12:55,413
Got you.

174
00:12:57,196 --> 00:12:59,152
Damn, this thing's rickety.

175
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,565
Lucy Chapman around?

176
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:27,957
Last stool on the other end.

177
00:14:33,174 --> 00:14:34,783
Lucy Chapman?

178
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:39,522
-Yeah.
-l'm Bannion, Homicide.

179
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:43,565
With this band playing, you need
megaphones to talk at the bar.

180
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,739
-We can sit in a booth.
-All right.

181
00:16:01,565 --> 00:16:03,130
-Yo, look, look!
-Oh, shit!

182
00:16:03,304 --> 00:16:05,826
-Yo, yo, got something?
-Oh, shit!

183
00:16:06,043 --> 00:16:08,783
-Yo, what happened?
-You son of a bitch!

184
00:16:09,174 --> 00:16:10,957
Dickheads, he wasn't asleep.

185
00:16:11,174 --> 00:16:14,043
-Yo, did you see him?
-No, not for long, yo.

186
00:16:18,696 --> 00:16:22,000
Jamal, would you stop bouncing
that damn ball in the house?

187
00:16:22,217 --> 00:16:25,609
l got Michael Jordan's name
written in dirt all over my floor.

188
00:16:25,783 --> 00:16:27,304
Don't worry, l'll clean it.

189
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:30,348
l got a better chance
of Michael Jordan cleaning it.

190
00:16:30,565 --> 00:16:34,304
lf you're thinking of a shower,
the hot water's taking a few minutes.

191
00:16:34,522 --> 00:16:37,870
-l wasn't thinking about it.
-Hey! Hey, where's your pack?

192
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,696
-l don't know.
-Don't know?

193
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,217
What do you mean, you don't know?

194
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:48,565
We wanted you to bring something,
not leave something.

195
00:16:48,783 --> 00:16:50,435
Leave this one alone, man.

196
00:16:50,783 --> 00:16:52,826
What was in your bag anyway?

197
00:16:53,652 --> 00:16:56,217
l'm not talking about the damn bag.

198
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:58,435
Bet you ain't, man.

199
00:16:58,696 --> 00:17:01,652
Let me teach you something.
Now watch the eyes.

200
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,000
He's probably watching you right now.

201
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,609
Stop. Stop. See?

202
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,565
You don't know about that, man.

203
00:17:10,174 --> 00:17:11,435
Here's how you do it.

204
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:12,043
l'm not gonna do anything
to your car, man.

205
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,391
l'm sorry?

206
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:15,870
You look worried,
like l'll do something.

207
00:18:16,087 --> 00:18:19,000
No, l worry about this car
everywhere, not just here.

208
00:18:19,217 --> 00:18:21,565
-Don't take it personally.
-lt's just a car.

209
00:18:21,783 --> 00:18:25,522
No, it's not just a car. lt's a BMW.

210
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:28,043
Those who know anything
about that company...

211
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:31,217
...know that it's more
than just a car.

212
00:18:31,435 --> 00:18:35,043
Oh, those who know. So l wouldn't
know anything like that, right?

213
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:36,870
No, that's not what l meant.

214
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:40,652
Last thing l knew about BMW...

215
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,783
...is, they made plane engines
when they first started.

216
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:47,043
A guy by the name of Franz Popp
started it all.

217
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,913
Franz Popp. l like that name.

218
00:18:51,435 --> 00:18:54,217
Made this one engine before 1 920.

219
00:18:54,435 --> 00:18:56,478
lt flew six miles up.

220
00:18:56,739 --> 00:18:59,783
Well, Popp and his boys were
just getting started, man.

221
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,609
Made this one engine,
the 801 , World War ll...

222
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:07,957
...14 cylinders,
2300 horsepower, seven miles up.

223
00:19:09,696 --> 00:19:12,957
With more time, they would have
bombed the shit out of England...

224
00:19:13,174 --> 00:19:15,000
...and maybe even won the war.

225
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,652
That's where this comes from.

226
00:19:18,652 --> 00:19:21,261
White propeller zipping
around a blue sky.

227
00:19:22,435 --> 00:19:25,652
After the war, they couldn't
make plane engines anymore.

228
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,609
And that's when BMW gave some
serious thought to making cars.

229
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,478
Kind of like this one.

230
00:19:33,391 --> 00:19:36,043
But you probably knew all that,
since you lease one.

231
00:19:36,565 --> 00:19:38,478
Thanks for the history lesson.

232
00:19:39,348 --> 00:19:40,826
No problem, man.

233
00:20:59,435 --> 00:21:01,696
Messing with my stuff, man.

234
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Hey....

235
00:21:58,957 --> 00:22:00,652
The other night was--

236
00:22:00,826 --> 00:22:03,913
lt was just this dare thing
me and my boys do.

237
00:22:21,043 --> 00:22:25,217
Well, l was wondering maybe l could
bring you some more of my stuff...

238
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:27,522
...or maybe l could
write something else.

239
00:22:27,739 --> 00:22:33,087
How about 5000 words on why you'll
stay the fuck out of my home?!

240
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,652
Come on, man, l know you in there.

241
00:23:21,696 --> 00:23:24,739
Take your goddamn hand off my door!

242
00:23:25,565 --> 00:23:30,478
l just came to drop off
that thing you asked me for.

243
00:23:30,696 --> 00:23:31,957
What thing?

244
00:23:32,696 --> 00:23:36,391
The 5000 words on why you wanted me
to stay out of your place.

245
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:38,435
That's kind of the way you said it.

246
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:42,957
Well, try remembering it
exactly as l said it.

247
00:24:11,304 --> 00:24:12,913
Come on in, Jamal.

248
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,478
Hi, honey.

249
00:24:15,174 --> 00:24:16,609
lt's okay.

250
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,217
Sit down.

251
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:24,348
Mrs. Wallace, Jamal. When we got
your recent test scores...

252
00:24:24,565 --> 00:24:27,826
...we figured there may be some
interest from private schools.

253
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:31,348
Well, it turns out we were right.

254
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,043
Mr. Bradley.

255
00:24:33,261 --> 00:24:36,348
Jamal, Mrs. Wallace,
my name's David Bradley.

256
00:24:36,522 --> 00:24:38,565
l'm with the Mailor School
in Manhattan.

257
00:24:38,783 --> 00:24:42,261
-Mailor? Mailor-Callow?
-That's right. You familiar with us?

258
00:24:42,957 --> 00:24:44,174
Yeah.

259
00:24:44,478 --> 00:24:48,043
Jamal, Mailor-Callow is not only
the best prep school in the city...

260
00:24:48,261 --> 00:24:51,174
...it's one of the finest
private schools in the East.

261
00:24:51,391 --> 00:24:52,739
Only the best go there.

262
00:24:53,043 --> 00:24:55,696
You may know we're a few weeks
into our fall term...

263
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:57,913
...but every year
we hold some openings...

264
00:24:58,087 --> 00:25:00,478
...while we wait
for test scores to come in.

265
00:25:01,261 --> 00:25:03,217
Jamal, your test scores...

266
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:06,261
...to put it mildly,
caught our attention.

267
00:25:07,304 --> 00:25:10,913
l'm here to see if you'd be
interested in attending our school.

268
00:25:12,957 --> 00:25:16,391
Jamal, we know leaving
for another school...

269
00:25:16,913 --> 00:25:19,870
...especially a private school,
is not gonna be easy.

270
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,565
But this isn't the right place
for you anymore.

271
00:25:23,826 --> 00:25:26,130
Jamal, it's not a difficult choice.

272
00:25:26,348 --> 00:25:27,870
Mr. Bradley...

273
00:25:29,522 --> 00:25:32,000
...there's no way
that we could pay for this.

274
00:25:32,217 --> 00:25:34,261
We're not asking you to.

275
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,870
When Dr. Simon said,
''Only the best go to Mailor''...

276
00:25:38,043 --> 00:25:39,826
...he neglected to mention...

277
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,826
...that our excellence extends beyond
the classroom.

278
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:44,043
l figured that.

279
00:25:44,261 --> 00:25:45,739
We thought you might.

280
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:50,522
Mrs. Wallace, about 40 of our students
have gone on to play college ball.

281
00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:53,261
Three have made it
to the professional level.

282
00:25:53,565 --> 00:25:55,957
We evaluated your play last year.

283
00:25:56,174 --> 00:25:58,391
While this is strictly
an academic offer...

284
00:25:58,609 --> 00:26:01,478
...we won't be disappointed
if you choose to play.

285
00:26:01,652 --> 00:26:05,652
All we ask is you come out for a
few days, take a look, think it over.

286
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,957
-Okay.
-Mrs. Wallace.

287
00:26:08,174 --> 00:26:09,826
-Thank you.
-Jamal.

288
00:26:10,913 --> 00:26:12,000
Goodbye.

289
00:26:12,217 --> 00:26:13,609
We'll be in touch.

290
00:27:02,304 --> 00:27:05,435
-l didn't knock this time, man.
-To whom were you speaking?

291
00:27:05,652 --> 00:27:08,783
l'll tell you that
when l get my 5000 words back.

292
00:27:49,391 --> 00:27:51,043
Bolt the door...

293
00:27:51,217 --> 00:27:52,435
...if you're coming in.

294
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:01,174
The man in the car?

295
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:08,783
He was from this private school.

296
00:28:09,826 --> 00:28:11,609
They want me to go there.

297
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:17,348
We don't have to pay anything, though.

298
00:28:19,304 --> 00:28:22,043
We live a couple blocks from here,
me and my mom.

299
00:28:23,391 --> 00:28:27,000
Well, my brother was there
a couple of years ago...

300
00:28:27,217 --> 00:28:29,478
...but he left after my dad left.

301
00:28:45,565 --> 00:28:49,435
My mom got tired of waiting
for my dad to get himself clean.

302
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,609
And my dad got tired of trying.

303
00:28:54,217 --> 00:28:56,217
But that's when l started writing.

304
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:57,783
What's your name?

305
00:28:58,304 --> 00:28:59,870
Jamal Wallace.

306
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:02,826
Sounds like some kind of marmalade.

307
00:29:03,522 --> 00:29:04,913
How old are you?

308
00:29:05,957 --> 00:29:07,435
l'm 1 6.

309
00:29:07,652 --> 00:29:09,391
Sixteen!

310
00:29:10,261 --> 00:29:11,217
And you're black!

311
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,217
-lt's remarkable.
-Remarkable? What?

312
00:29:18,348 --> 00:29:20,696
lt's remarkable that l'm black?

313
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,739
What does me being black
got to do with anything, man?

314
00:29:28,522 --> 00:29:31,000
You don't know what to do
right now, do you?

315
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,565
lf you say what you
really want to say...

316
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:36,174
...l might not read any more of this.

317
00:29:36,696 --> 00:29:40,652
But if you let me run you down
with this racist bullshit...

318
00:29:42,391 --> 00:29:44,913
...what does that make you?

319
00:29:48,783 --> 00:29:50,478
l'm not playing this game, man.

320
00:29:50,696 --> 00:29:54,217
Oh, l say you are playing it.

321
00:29:54,435 --> 00:29:57,739
An expression is worth
a thousand words.

322
00:29:58,565 --> 00:30:02,565
But perhaps in your case just two.

323
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,522
Here.

324
00:30:26,565 --> 00:30:28,043
What an asshole.

325
00:30:34,739 --> 00:30:38,696
One hand to give, one hand to receive.
As we eat together in unity...

326
00:30:38,913 --> 00:30:42,652
...may our minds, bodies
and spirits grow strong...

327
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,217
...and congratulations to Jamal.

328
00:30:45,348 --> 00:30:46,870
Amen.

329
00:30:47,043 --> 00:30:48,522
-Amen.
-Amen.

330
00:30:48,739 --> 00:30:50,000
Did you see this?

331
00:30:50,217 --> 00:30:52,435
-Let me see.
-Don't mess it up.

332
00:30:52,957 --> 00:30:53,957
Wait a minute.

333
00:30:54,174 --> 00:30:57,174
From the cover this look like
the funny-man school to me.

334
00:30:57,391 --> 00:30:59,130
Terrell, eat your food.

335
00:30:59,304 --> 00:31:03,000
You'll be fine, big bro, because
Mommy don't make nothing but soldiers.

336
00:31:03,217 --> 00:31:05,217
You could have done the same thing.

337
00:31:05,478 --> 00:31:08,913
l work at a parking lot. And l ain't
no regular parking attendant.

338
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,043
l am the supervisor
of all the parking attendants.

339
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:15,174
You don't know how much
you'll make from week to week.

340
00:31:15,391 --> 00:31:17,565
One week it's $50,
one week it's $1 00.

341
00:31:17,783 --> 00:31:19,826
-That's not a real job.
-Leave him alone.

342
00:31:20,043 --> 00:31:23,478
Ma, look, l rap, l get busy.
You know l got my rap thing going.

343
00:31:23,696 --> 00:31:25,870
Don't bring up the rap.
Eat your food.

344
00:31:26,087 --> 00:31:28,261
-You don't want to hear my songs?
-Eat.

345
00:31:28,435 --> 00:31:29,957
l'll sing it for you now.

346
00:31:30,174 --> 00:31:32,304
When l come due
And l blow the spot

347
00:31:32,478 --> 00:31:35,478
Yourson is supervisor
Of the parking lot

348
00:31:37,348 --> 00:31:39,652
Tell her, Jamal.
My choice is hot, right?

349
00:32:26,913 --> 00:32:28,609
Jamal Wallace?

350
00:32:29,304 --> 00:32:31,783
Hi, l'm Claire Spence.

351
00:32:33,913 --> 00:32:36,478
Bradley asked me to show you around.

352
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,217
All right.

353
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:43,087
Come on.

354
00:32:48,652 --> 00:32:51,522
Don't worry about answering
any questions or anything.

355
00:32:51,696 --> 00:32:53,826
Not till you decide
what you're gonna do.

356
00:32:54,087 --> 00:32:56,739
Besides, the teachers here...

357
00:32:56,957 --> 00:32:59,739
...aren't all that into
student participation.

358
00:32:59,957 --> 00:33:02,087
They're busy listening
to themselves talk.

359
00:33:02,304 --> 00:33:04,522
-What do you mean?
-You'll see.

360
00:33:04,957 --> 00:33:08,870
This morning we begin our third
required reading of the semester...

361
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,391
...the study of a novel
that offers everything...

362
00:33:11,609 --> 00:33:14,261
...and an author who could
have offered much more.

363
00:33:18,739 --> 00:33:20,609
That's Robert Crawford.

364
00:33:20,826 --> 00:33:23,000
Been here as long
as most of the buildings.

365
00:33:23,174 --> 00:33:26,652
When William Forrester was 23,
in 1 953...

366
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,348
...he set out to write his first book.

367
00:33:29,913 --> 00:33:34,348
Many aspiring authors talk about
writing the great 20th-century novel...

368
00:33:34,522 --> 00:33:37,130
...well, William Forrester did it.

369
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,435
On his first try.

370
00:33:39,609 --> 00:33:41,000
Have you read this?

371
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,435
Yeah, you?

372
00:33:43,696 --> 00:33:45,957
Only about a dozen times.

373
00:33:46,174 --> 00:33:48,783
This was the only one
he chose to publish.

374
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,913
For all we know it was the only one
he chose to write.

375
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,913
Your job over the next week--

376
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:58,000
Your job over the next week
is to read it and tell me why.

377
00:33:58,217 --> 00:33:59,348
So...

378
00:34:00,261 --> 00:34:02,174
...you gonna be back tomorrow?

379
00:34:02,391 --> 00:34:05,043
Yeah, they want me to spend
some time on the court.

380
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:06,652
Yeah, l heard.

381
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:10,652
Graduation was a little rough
on last year's team, that's all.

382
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:13,391
But it's just like college, right?

383
00:34:13,826 --> 00:34:17,217
You get an education,
and they get what they want.

384
00:34:17,478 --> 00:34:19,261
Maybe you both get what you want.

385
00:34:19,435 --> 00:34:20,783
Yeah, maybe.

386
00:34:22,826 --> 00:34:24,957
lt was very nice meeting you, Jamal.

387
00:34:25,783 --> 00:34:28,609
You too, Claire. You gonna
be around tomorrow?

388
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:30,522
Not where you'll be...

389
00:34:31,522 --> 00:34:33,913
...but you might be able
to find me for lunch.

390
00:34:41,652 --> 00:34:43,348
l didn't say those two words.

391
00:34:43,565 --> 00:34:45,130
Why didn't you?

392
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:48,478
Because l want you to read
more of my stuff.

393
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:55,087
You know, they talk a lot
about you out there.

394
00:34:56,043 --> 00:34:57,957
All this ''legend'' bullshit.

395
00:34:58,174 --> 00:35:00,043
They got some stories, though.

396
00:35:00,261 --> 00:35:02,304
People wonder if you killed somebody.

397
00:35:02,478 --> 00:35:04,870
That, and wondering
why you been in here so long.

398
00:35:05,087 --> 00:35:07,609
l wouldn't move, though.
l'd stay for the quiet.

399
00:35:07,826 --> 00:35:09,696
You don't hear nothing in here.

400
00:35:10,217 --> 00:35:12,391
Our place got these noisy neighbors.

401
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:15,609
Their kid's always yelling
because he's only a year old.

402
00:35:15,783 --> 00:35:18,522
Or pops is yelling
because the kid's making noise.

403
00:35:18,739 --> 00:35:20,348
Then mom's yelling--

404
00:35:20,565 --> 00:35:22,000
But that's a different yelling...

405
00:35:22,217 --> 00:35:25,870
...because that's when the old man's
playing the tunes for her...

406
00:35:26,043 --> 00:35:28,696
...and she got her head
banging up against the wall.

407
00:35:28,913 --> 00:35:30,174
She be screaming like....

408
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:33,348
-Then she--
-You better stir that soup.

409
00:35:33,913 --> 00:35:34,913
What?

410
00:35:36,174 --> 00:35:38,087
Stir the soup before it foams up.

411
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:47,739
How come ours never
gets anything on it?

412
00:35:47,957 --> 00:35:50,391
Come on. Come on. Closer.

413
00:35:52,043 --> 00:35:52,913
Now.

414
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:57,435
-You got somebody doing that yelling?
-What l have here is an adult male...

415
00:35:57,652 --> 00:35:59,609
...quite pretty...

416
00:36:00,565 --> 00:36:03,217
...probably strayed from the park.

417
00:36:07,913 --> 00:36:09,870
A Connecticut Warbler.

418
00:36:10,565 --> 00:36:13,174
You ever go outside to do any of this?

419
00:36:14,043 --> 00:36:16,652
You should have stayed
with the soup question.

420
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:20,739
The object of a question is to obtain
information that matters to us...

421
00:36:20,957 --> 00:36:23,043
...and to no one else.

422
00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:27,478
You were wondering why
your soup doesn't foam up?

423
00:36:27,696 --> 00:36:30,609
Probably because your mother
was brought up in a house...

424
00:36:30,783 --> 00:36:33,652
...that never thought
about wasting milk in soup.

425
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:36,130
Now that question was a good one.

426
00:36:36,739 --> 00:36:40,565
ln contrast to,
''Do l ever go outside?''

427
00:36:40,783 --> 00:36:42,739
Which fails to meet
the basic criteria...

428
00:36:42,913 --> 00:36:45,522
...of obtaining information
that matters to you.

429
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:47,130
All right, man.

430
00:36:47,348 --> 00:36:49,739
Guess l don't have
any more soup questions.

431
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,130
No?

432
00:36:52,348 --> 00:36:55,000
Why did you say that stuff
about me being black?

433
00:36:55,174 --> 00:36:57,739
lt had nothing to do
with you being black.

434
00:36:57,957 --> 00:37:02,391
lt had to do with me finding out just
how much bullshit you'd put up with.

435
00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:03,826
You knew l'd come back.

436
00:37:04,043 --> 00:37:06,783
Yes, just like l know
you'll go to this new school.

437
00:37:07,174 --> 00:37:08,261
How you know that?

438
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:11,000
Because there's a question
in your writing...

439
00:37:11,217 --> 00:37:13,783
...suggesting what is it
you wish to do with your life.

440
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,043
And that is a question your present
school cannot answer for you.

441
00:37:22,348 --> 00:37:25,043
Let's match up.
Wallace, you take Hartwell.

442
00:37:28,565 --> 00:37:29,870
What's up, man? l'm Jamal.

443
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,478
Just check it, all right?

444
00:37:36,043 --> 00:37:37,870
-Check the ball.
-Let's go, guys.

445
00:37:38,087 --> 00:37:39,217
Come on now.

446
00:37:42,391 --> 00:37:43,826
Ball's in.

447
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:46,783
Come on!

448
00:37:47,217 --> 00:37:49,174
-Cover Danson! Get on him!
-Let's go.

449
00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:52,435
Play him tough, play him tough.

450
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:54,130
Here, Johnny, inside!

451
00:37:55,783 --> 00:37:57,565
Way to go. Way to go, gang.

452
00:38:00,913 --> 00:38:02,435
Let's go, D up.

453
00:38:02,652 --> 00:38:04,174
-Let's go, garbage.
-Come on.

454
00:38:04,391 --> 00:38:06,304
-Come on.
-Step up. Step up.

455
00:38:06,522 --> 00:38:07,522
Head's up.

456
00:38:12,304 --> 00:38:14,739
Leave the trash-talking
back home, all right?

457
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:16,652
What?

458
00:38:17,174 --> 00:38:19,174
Get that goofy look off your face.

459
00:38:19,348 --> 00:38:21,304
-l'm gonna make you my son.
-Right.

460
00:38:21,522 --> 00:38:23,261
-You gonna be my son.
-Come on.

461
00:38:31,913 --> 00:38:33,043
Let's go.

462
00:38:36,043 --> 00:38:37,913
-Come on, man.
-What?

463
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:40,043
-You're too small.
-What?

464
00:38:41,826 --> 00:38:43,391
Nice handle.

465
00:38:45,826 --> 00:38:48,478
Hartwell, a little defense
would be real nice.

466
00:38:48,696 --> 00:38:51,174
Coach is right. A little defense.
Let's go.

467
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,565
-Try and get it past the line.
-What?

468
00:38:53,783 --> 00:38:55,522
l said, get it past the line.

469
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:58,522
ls this too much? Pressure.

470
00:39:02,043 --> 00:39:03,957
Too much.

471
00:39:08,217 --> 00:39:09,478
l need some help!

472
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,391
Ten seconds. Let's go,
the other way.

473
00:39:27,652 --> 00:39:28,783
l'm taking your spot?

474
00:39:28,957 --> 00:39:30,043
-Taking what?
-Your spot.

475
00:39:30,261 --> 00:39:32,217
Taking nothing. Come on.

476
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,957
My court, man. My court.

477
00:39:53,696 --> 00:39:55,304
That's how we play down here.

478
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:56,565
That's right.

479
00:39:59,783 --> 00:40:01,130
Hartwell's just a rich kid...

480
00:40:01,348 --> 00:40:04,870
...who wants as much of the spotlight
as he can get his senior year.

481
00:40:05,087 --> 00:40:06,130
That's all it is.

482
00:40:06,348 --> 00:40:08,870
They take things real serious
around here.

483
00:40:09,087 --> 00:40:11,522
Well, it's a serious place.

484
00:40:11,739 --> 00:40:14,696
Serious enough l usually end up
here, getting lunch on my books.

485
00:40:16,174 --> 00:40:17,522
What are you working on?

486
00:40:19,609 --> 00:40:21,130
Forrester's book.

487
00:40:21,348 --> 00:40:23,043
l thought you read it.

488
00:40:23,217 --> 00:40:25,217
l know, but look at this.

489
00:40:25,391 --> 00:40:27,348
My dad got it for me.

490
00:40:27,565 --> 00:40:29,087
lt's an early printing.

491
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,000
Listen, l gotta go.

492
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:38,478
But you just got here.

493
00:40:38,652 --> 00:40:39,913
l know, but...

494
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,478
...l forgot something.

495
00:40:41,652 --> 00:40:43,739
l gotta check up on something.

496
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,696
l'll see you later.

497
00:41:06,174 --> 00:41:08,043
''Born 1 930.

498
00:41:08,522 --> 00:41:10,261
ln Scotland.''

499
00:41:18,348 --> 00:41:22,391
''Moved to New York with his family
in his late teens.

500
00:41:23,087 --> 00:41:25,913
Mr. Forrester was unavailable
for comment.''

501
00:41:27,217 --> 00:41:28,826
Yeah, l bet he was.

502
00:41:29,043 --> 00:41:29,087
Are we now planning
to make these visits a habit?

503
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:31,826
Are we now planning
to make these visits a habit?

504
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:38,391
-You said you knew l'd be coming back.
-Yes, but l thought you meant once.

505
00:41:38,739 --> 00:41:41,174
l need some help with
this thing at school.

506
00:41:41,391 --> 00:41:44,478
Ah, yes, this thing at school.

507
00:41:44,696 --> 00:41:47,826
And what ''thing'' are we
talking about now?

508
00:41:53,304 --> 00:41:55,348
You ever read that?

509
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:01,261
l'm trying, man.

510
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:04,652
l just can't seem to get past
the first 1 0 pages.

511
00:42:06,043 --> 00:42:09,217
As l recall...

512
00:42:10,435 --> 00:42:13,000
...l took a while
to get past those pages myself.

513
00:42:16,565 --> 00:42:19,130
Oh, Christ, you've
dog-eared one of them.

514
00:42:19,348 --> 00:42:21,870
Show a little respect
for the author, huh?

515
00:42:27,522 --> 00:42:29,304
That's you, isn't it?

516
00:42:30,522 --> 00:42:32,130
You're the author.

517
00:42:34,826 --> 00:42:37,609
l read the whole thing.
lt's not bad. Especially--

518
00:42:37,826 --> 00:42:39,043
Hey...

519
00:42:39,826 --> 00:42:41,261
...l know what it is.

520
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:45,478
l don't need another person
telling me what they think it is.

521
00:42:45,652 --> 00:42:46,957
l wasn't gonna say that.

522
00:42:47,174 --> 00:42:48,652
What were you gonna say?

523
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,826
l should tell you everything about me?

524
00:42:51,087 --> 00:42:52,435
l told you about me.

525
00:42:52,652 --> 00:42:55,174
You could learn
a little something about...

526
00:42:55,391 --> 00:42:57,174
...holding back.

527
00:43:29,957 --> 00:43:33,739
lf l ask you not to say
anything to anybody...

528
00:43:34,217 --> 00:43:37,000
...about here, us...

529
00:43:38,043 --> 00:43:40,087
...is that something
l can trust you on?

530
00:43:45,565 --> 00:43:46,783
Yeah.

531
00:43:47,609 --> 00:43:48,609
l promise.

532
00:43:49,652 --> 00:43:51,043
Fine.

533
00:43:52,522 --> 00:43:55,217
And if l ask you to keep helping
me with my writing?

534
00:44:10,913 --> 00:44:12,391
There'll be no questions...

535
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:15,304
...about me, my family...

536
00:44:15,522 --> 00:44:17,652
...or why there was only one book.

537
00:44:17,826 --> 00:44:19,522
Then l won't ask.

538
00:44:20,565 --> 00:44:22,000
Good.

539
00:44:22,435 --> 00:44:23,957
And good night.

540
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:35,739
What's it feel like?

541
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,957
What?

542
00:44:38,174 --> 00:44:40,478
Writing something the way you did.

543
00:44:42,435 --> 00:44:44,435
Perhaps you'll find out.

544
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:03,522
Listen, you 5-foot-nothing.

545
00:45:06,826 --> 00:45:09,000
He's probably still
sleeping in the crib.

546
00:45:11,348 --> 00:45:12,913
Kenzo, how old are you again?

547
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,348
Why?

548
00:45:14,565 --> 00:45:17,609
Look at your face!
Did your mom do that to you?

549
00:45:17,826 --> 00:45:19,043
She started you young.

550
00:45:19,261 --> 00:45:22,391
You know where that starts from?
Eating too much cookie.

551
00:45:25,043 --> 00:45:27,261
Teresa told me. She told me.

552
00:45:27,478 --> 00:45:29,609
l like them big. You got a problem?

553
00:45:29,826 --> 00:45:31,261
l like them big.

554
00:45:32,261 --> 00:45:33,391
That big?

555
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:37,696
lt's like when l'm with
all three of your mothers.

556
00:45:37,913 --> 00:45:41,174
-You're not talking about my mother.
-Hold on, Oscar Mayer wiener.

557
00:45:41,783 --> 00:45:44,826
Stop playing. You got beat
like Tina in school one day.

558
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,913
l seen Duke smack you up.

559
00:45:47,087 --> 00:45:48,783
Listen, throw it at your mama.

560
00:45:48,957 --> 00:45:50,652
Everything tilts towards your mama.

561
00:45:51,913 --> 00:45:54,304
Your mama. Stop throwing your mama.

562
00:45:57,261 --> 00:45:58,696
Why you laughing?

563
00:45:58,913 --> 00:46:01,478
Yo, man, your glasses
are like Coke bottles.

564
00:46:03,348 --> 00:46:04,391
Classics.

565
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:09,522
-You ever met somebody famous?
-How famous?

566
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:11,478
Like, l don't know...

567
00:46:13,304 --> 00:46:15,304
...somebody people would know.

568
00:46:15,783 --> 00:46:18,348
Nobody like that
comes around here, man.

569
00:46:22,609 --> 00:46:24,478
So, you here for good now?

570
00:46:25,435 --> 00:46:27,826
Yeah, l'm just trying to get started.

571
00:46:31,913 --> 00:46:33,870
Well, at least they look good.

572
00:46:34,043 --> 00:46:35,304
Right?

573
00:46:46,609 --> 00:46:49,913
This year's writing competition
has now been scheduled.

574
00:46:50,609 --> 00:46:53,870
For those who choose to take part,
entries must be turned in...

575
00:46:54,087 --> 00:46:55,435
...before spring break.

576
00:46:55,609 --> 00:46:58,609
Meaning, you still have
a few months of procrastination.

577
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:04,478
Feel free to experiment with
a more proactive approach. The--

578
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:08,652
Mr. Wallace!

579
00:47:09,435 --> 00:47:10,522
Please.

580
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:14,348
l had a chance this morning...

581
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:17,783
...to review the files sent over
by your former school.

582
00:47:19,217 --> 00:47:21,304
Test scores, impressive.

583
00:47:21,522 --> 00:47:23,261
Actual classroom work...

584
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,391
...not so impressive.

585
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,478
ls this...

586
00:47:27,696 --> 00:47:30,652
...the level of work
l should anticipate, Mr. Wallace?

587
00:47:34,826 --> 00:47:37,348
Because if it is...

588
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:41,609
...it will help me determine whether
l should treat you as a student...

589
00:47:41,783 --> 00:47:44,000
...or as someone here
simply to pursue--

590
00:47:44,217 --> 00:47:45,391
How should l put it?

591
00:47:46,304 --> 00:47:48,000
Other endeavors?

592
00:47:49,391 --> 00:47:52,783
Of course your work will give you
ample opportunity to respond.

593
00:47:55,261 --> 00:47:56,609
Good day, Mr. Wallace.

594
00:48:03,435 --> 00:48:06,913
Just so you know,
you handled that the right way.

595
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,435
How's that?

596
00:48:08,826 --> 00:48:10,348
You didn't say anything.

597
00:48:10,565 --> 00:48:13,043
lt's the ones that do
that run into trouble.

598
00:48:13,304 --> 00:48:15,565
-John Coleridge.
-Jamal Wallace.

599
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:21,391
So how many people do say something?

600
00:48:21,739 --> 00:48:24,217
And actually stay in Crawford's class?

601
00:48:24,391 --> 00:48:25,870
Not many.

602
00:48:27,043 --> 00:48:28,739
l missed what you said.

603
00:48:30,174 --> 00:48:31,870
l didn't say anything.

604
00:48:36,609 --> 00:48:38,087
You read all these?

605
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:42,130
No, l just keep them
to impress all my visitors.

606
00:48:43,522 --> 00:48:45,478
All your visitors.

607
00:48:46,043 --> 00:48:48,261
We talk about your book at school.

608
00:48:48,435 --> 00:48:50,870
People have been talking
about it for years.

609
00:48:51,087 --> 00:48:53,435
They just haven't been
saying anything.

610
00:48:53,957 --> 00:48:55,826
Yeah, l think l got it down, though.

611
00:48:56,043 --> 00:48:59,174
l figure you were writing
about how life never works out.

612
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:03,522
Oh, really? You had to
read a book to figure that out?

613
00:49:04,261 --> 00:49:07,522
Yeah, but Crawford's
messed up on it anyhow.

614
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:10,826
Says the guy having trouble
after the war is really you.

615
00:49:11,043 --> 00:49:15,522
Some symbolism shit for the problems
you were having with everybody.

616
00:49:15,739 --> 00:49:17,478
Robert Crawford?

617
00:49:18,087 --> 00:49:20,174
Yeah, l think it's bullshit, though.

618
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:22,957
l think there really was
somebody else.

619
00:49:29,609 --> 00:49:31,391
Mr. Johannsen?

620
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,043
Here.

621
00:49:33,478 --> 00:49:37,652
Mr. Massie! Another trip
to your favorite destination.

622
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:40,478
l've got four bags today.
l can leave them.

623
00:49:40,652 --> 00:49:41,696
Oh, no, no.

624
00:49:44,478 --> 00:49:45,783
Come right in.

625
00:49:46,522 --> 00:49:48,348
How you doing, Mr. Johannsen?

626
00:49:48,696 --> 00:49:51,652
At least a half-hour
before the sun goes down.

627
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:55,565
Then you can begin your
panic-driven quest back to Manhattan.

628
00:49:55,783 --> 00:49:57,957
This should last you till next week.

629
00:49:58,348 --> 00:49:59,957
Your mail is in...

630
00:50:00,174 --> 00:50:01,130
...this one.

631
00:50:01,348 --> 00:50:03,217
-Mr. Johannsen?
-Essentials are in--

632
00:50:03,435 --> 00:50:05,087
Essentials?

633
00:50:05,478 --> 00:50:09,783
l took care of your bills, and
l put all the copies in this one.

634
00:50:09,957 --> 00:50:12,652
The phone company wonders
if you still want service...

635
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:15,783
...as you haven't had a call in six--
Okay.

636
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,783
l got your socks
for the next couple weeks...

637
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,522
...which are in this one.

638
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:23,913
And l have your latest check
from accounting.

639
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:26,696
They wanted to know if you
cashed the last one.

640
00:50:26,913 --> 00:50:28,826
lt's still showing up outstanding.

641
00:50:29,043 --> 00:50:31,913
Not as outstanding as it once was.

642
00:50:36,696 --> 00:50:39,478
l'm sorry, l didn't realize
you had company.

643
00:50:39,696 --> 00:50:42,652
Oh, yes. We were just
having a discussion...

644
00:50:42,826 --> 00:50:45,913
...on German automobile history.

645
00:50:46,087 --> 00:50:49,174
-Care to join us?
-No, l'm in a tow-away.

646
00:50:49,348 --> 00:50:50,391
Of course you are.

647
00:50:50,609 --> 00:50:51,870
See you next week?

648
00:50:52,087 --> 00:50:53,870
Not if l'm lucky.

649
00:50:59,217 --> 00:51:02,304
Why not give that guy a break
and do your own shopping?

650
00:51:02,739 --> 00:51:06,739
-And why are your socks inside out?
-Because socks are badly designed.

651
00:51:06,957 --> 00:51:10,304
The seams are on the inside.
Hurt the toes.

652
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:15,348
ln some cultures, it's considered good
luck to wear something inside out.

653
00:51:15,565 --> 00:51:16,826
And you believe that?

654
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,957
No, but it's like praying.

655
00:51:19,174 --> 00:51:20,478
What do you risk?

656
00:51:20,696 --> 00:51:22,652
And l do go outside.

657
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:25,348
How do you think those windows
get cleaned?

658
00:51:27,696 --> 00:51:29,652
Now, about this...

659
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:31,391
...professor of yours.

660
00:51:31,609 --> 00:51:35,783
How did it feel having him
tell you what you can't do?

661
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,913
-Like he knew he was better than me.
-Then let's show him what you can do.

662
00:51:42,261 --> 00:51:44,522
Why are the words we write
for ourselves...

663
00:51:44,739 --> 00:51:48,565
...always so much better than those
we write for others? Move.

664
00:51:52,087 --> 00:51:53,304
Sit.

665
00:52:02,957 --> 00:52:03,957
Go ahead.

666
00:52:05,261 --> 00:52:06,565
Go ahead and what?

667
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:08,000
Write.

668
00:52:10,609 --> 00:52:11,826
What are you doing?

669
00:52:12,043 --> 00:52:14,696
l'm writing. Like you'll be...

670
00:52:14,913 --> 00:52:16,870
...when you start punching those keys.

671
00:52:22,261 --> 00:52:23,478
ls there a problem?

672
00:52:23,696 --> 00:52:25,000
No, l'm just thinking.

673
00:52:25,217 --> 00:52:26,652
No. No thinking.

674
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:28,391
That comes later.

675
00:52:32,565 --> 00:52:34,304
You write your first draft...

676
00:52:35,522 --> 00:52:36,391
...with your heart...

677
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:40,522
...and you rewrite with your head.

678
00:52:44,435 --> 00:52:46,609
The first key to writing...

679
00:52:46,826 --> 00:52:49,043
...is to write.

680
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:51,652
Not to think.

681
00:53:01,783 --> 00:53:03,478
Jesus!

682
00:53:40,522 --> 00:53:42,739
ls there a chance you might sit down?

683
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,826
''A Season of Faith's Perfection.''

684
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
-What's this?
-Start typing that.

685
00:54:06,217 --> 00:54:08,783
Sometimes the simple rhythm
of typing...

686
00:54:08,957 --> 00:54:11,783
...gets us from page one to page two.

687
00:54:12,174 --> 00:54:14,870
And when you begin to feel
your own words...

688
00:54:15,304 --> 00:54:17,304
...start typing them.

689
00:54:38,739 --> 00:54:41,000
Punch the keys, for God's sake!

690
00:54:51,348 --> 00:54:52,826
Yes!

691
00:54:54,435 --> 00:54:55,957
Yes!

692
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:59,435
You're the man now, dog!

693
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,478
Jamal...

694
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:07,957
...whatever we write
in this apartment...

695
00:56:08,304 --> 00:56:10,696
...stays in this apartment.

696
00:56:11,304 --> 00:56:12,435
No exceptions.

697
00:56:45,174 --> 00:56:47,304
Okay, let's push it, guys. Come on.

698
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,652
-Heads up.
-Yo, D!

699
00:56:53,652 --> 00:56:54,783
That's a foul, man.

700
00:56:54,957 --> 00:56:57,957
-l had the spot.
-You'll know when you got the spot.

701
00:56:58,130 --> 00:56:59,478
Hey, hey, gentlemen!

702
00:56:59,696 --> 00:57:02,261
-Hey, hey!
-Our season begins in one week.

703
00:57:02,478 --> 00:57:06,435
lf l see this one more time, you'll
shoot fouls to see who runs today.

704
00:57:06,652 --> 00:57:09,565
ls that understood?
ls that understood?

705
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,217
One.

706
00:57:17,348 --> 00:57:18,435
Two.

707
00:57:22,565 --> 00:57:23,739
Three.

708
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:28,957
Eleven.

709
00:57:32,957 --> 00:57:34,391
Twelve.

710
00:57:37,261 --> 00:57:38,652
Thirteen.

711
00:57:41,087 --> 00:57:42,739
Twenty-nine.

712
00:57:51,087 --> 00:57:52,478
Forty-eight.

713
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:57,391
Forty-nine.

714
00:58:02,609 --> 00:58:03,783
Hold it.

715
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:07,043
One more.

716
00:58:20,652 --> 00:58:24,565
That's one of the most impressive
things l've ever seen on a court.

717
00:58:24,783 --> 00:58:27,739
Why do l know it wasn't good
enough for either of you?

718
00:58:27,957 --> 00:58:29,870
Shower up and get out of here.

719
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,913
You may think we're the same.
We're not.

720
00:58:43,522 --> 00:58:44,826
Oh, Mr. Wallace.

721
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,304
Mr. Wallace!

722
00:58:48,913 --> 00:58:52,391
-Professor Crawford.
-The latest paper you turned in....

723
00:58:54,435 --> 00:58:57,609
lt showed quite a bit of improvement
from your earlier work.

724
00:58:58,217 --> 00:58:59,652
-Thank you.
-Yes.

725
00:58:59,826 --> 00:59:03,217
-How long did it take you to write it?
-l wrote it last night.

726
00:59:03,435 --> 00:59:04,826
Last night!

727
00:59:06,087 --> 00:59:09,130
Well, l have some things
to finish up here.

728
00:59:09,304 --> 00:59:10,696
Good day, Mr. Wallace.

729
00:59:19,261 --> 00:59:21,000
That's right. Select again.

730
00:59:21,217 --> 00:59:23,783
-''Birds ofa Feather'' for 600.
-Answer:

731
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,565
Vibrant in color, its name borrows
from this Vivien Leigh character.

732
00:59:27,739 --> 00:59:31,478
-The scarlet tanager.
-lt's, ''What is the scarlet tanager?''

733
00:59:31,696 --> 00:59:33,609
What is the scarlet tanager?.

734
00:59:33,783 --> 00:59:35,652
Gotta know the rules to play.

735
00:59:35,826 --> 00:59:38,913
lt was written by a writer
you have never heard of.

736
00:59:39,913 --> 00:59:43,217
''Thy duty, winged flame of spring

737
00:59:43,435 --> 00:59:47,043
ls but to love and fly and sing.''

738
00:59:47,217 --> 00:59:50,304
He was writing about the song
of the tanager.

739
00:59:50,522 --> 00:59:55,000
A song about new seasons, new life.

740
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:57,304
That's James Lowell, man.

741
00:59:57,478 --> 00:59:59,391
l know who he is.

742
01:00:00,174 --> 01:00:03,826
''l'll stay with 'Poor Assumptions'
for 800, Alex.''

743
01:00:04,826 --> 01:00:07,304
You ever see any
scarlet tanagers around here?

744
01:00:07,565 --> 01:00:10,348
They don't stray that far
from the park.

745
01:00:15,783 --> 01:00:20,174
So your professor wasn't exactly
full of praise this afternoon.

746
01:00:20,913 --> 01:00:22,826
No, not exactly.

747
01:00:23,304 --> 01:00:27,783
Well, there's something you should
know about Robert Crawford.

748
01:00:28,609 --> 01:00:31,609
He wrote a book
a few years after mine.

749
01:00:32,043 --> 01:00:36,391
And all the publishers rejected it,
which was the right decision.

750
01:00:36,565 --> 01:00:39,826
And instead of writing another one...

751
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:44,739
...he took a job
teaching others how to write.

752
01:00:45,609 --> 01:00:47,043
How you know all that?

753
01:00:47,217 --> 01:00:50,783
Just keep in mind that
bitterly disappointed teachers...

754
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,304
...can be either very effective
or very dangerous.

755
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:46,909
All right, this is
the first step tonight, guys.

756
01:01:47,126 --> 01:01:48,909
''Mailor'' on three.

757
01:01:49,126 --> 01:01:51,909
One, two, three, Mailor!

758
01:02:18,396 --> 01:02:19,743
Gold.

759
01:02:19,961 --> 01:02:21,048
Black.

760
01:02:22,396 --> 01:02:24,613
Up here, up straight and high.
Not yet.

761
01:02:37,048 --> 01:02:39,787
-What up, J?
-What up? You was in there tonight?

762
01:02:39,917 --> 01:02:41,004
Twenty-six points.

763
01:02:41,222 --> 01:02:43,743
Eight of 1 0 from the floor.
Ten of 1 0 from the line.

764
01:02:43,961 --> 01:02:46,570
-l'm supposed to miss that?
-All right, it was hot.

765
01:02:46,743 --> 01:02:50,004
You were putting some serious ink
on that stat page, man.

766
01:02:50,178 --> 01:02:51,178
What's going on?

767
01:02:51,396 --> 01:02:54,091
Yo, brothers was going
by Red Rose, man.

768
01:02:54,265 --> 01:02:56,917
l told them we catch up.
Friday night, kid.

769
01:02:57,135 --> 01:02:58,135
Come on. Come on.

770
01:02:58,352 --> 01:03:01,439
Hey, Jamal, you plan
on doing that every night?

771
01:03:01,613 --> 01:03:04,483
-Worked out, l guess.
-l'd say it worked out.

772
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:07,961
This is Fly.

773
01:03:08,178 --> 01:03:09,874
-Hi, Fly, l'm Claire.
-How you doing?

774
01:03:10,091 --> 01:03:11,874
-You a friend of Jamal's?
-Claire!

775
01:03:12,396 --> 01:03:13,396
Come on!

776
01:03:13,613 --> 01:03:14,874
l'm coming.

777
01:03:15,265 --> 01:03:18,352
Don't hold that bus up too long.
Nice meeting you, Fly.

778
01:03:19,396 --> 01:03:22,265
All right! What the hell
you working there, man?

779
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:25,657
Shut up, man.

780
01:03:26,961 --> 01:03:31,135
Yo, about Red Rose.
l ain't gonna make it.

781
01:03:31,309 --> 01:03:34,222
l gotta go to this dude house.
They do it every year.

782
01:03:34,743 --> 01:03:36,309
Don't be going off on this.

783
01:03:36,526 --> 01:03:40,396
You big time. You best be going.
l don't want to hold your bus up.

784
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:42,091
You around this weekend?

785
01:03:42,309 --> 01:03:45,961
Where you think l'm gonna be? ln
the Hamptons?

786
01:04:36,874 --> 01:04:40,439
lt was very nice talking with you.
Remember, anything you need...

787
01:04:40,657 --> 01:04:43,657
...please give me a call.
Okay? Anything.

788
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:45,570
Okay?

789
01:04:51,309 --> 01:04:54,048
Building up a collection
of those things?

790
01:04:55,004 --> 01:04:56,439
Yeah, a few.

791
01:04:56,743 --> 01:04:58,874
Do you want to get outside
for a while?

792
01:04:59,526 --> 01:05:01,874
Yeah. You know this place?

793
01:05:03,048 --> 01:05:06,222
l live in this place. Come on.

794
01:05:13,613 --> 01:05:17,874
They'll be in there till midnight,
congratulating themselves on your game.

795
01:05:18,091 --> 01:05:21,874
Which means l get to cram tomorrow
for this test on Monday.

796
01:05:22,091 --> 01:05:23,439
Test on what?

797
01:05:23,657 --> 01:05:25,570
lt's on the Sherlock Holmes books.

798
01:05:25,787 --> 01:05:28,917
They have us tracking down
all this worthless stuff, like:

799
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:31,178
''Who introduced Watson to Holmes?''

800
01:05:31,396 --> 01:05:34,439
They give it to you
to force you to read everything.

801
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:37,700
Looks like it might be a while.

802
01:05:38,178 --> 01:05:39,830
Maybe so.

803
01:05:40,048 --> 01:05:44,004
So this friend Fly.
How long have you known each other?

804
01:05:44,526 --> 01:05:47,830
For a while. He was born there,
and l was born there too.

805
01:05:48,048 --> 01:05:49,743
-ln the Bronx?
-Yeah.

806
01:05:49,961 --> 01:05:51,439
Must be hard.

807
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:52,787
What?

808
01:05:53,004 --> 01:05:55,483
l don't know. New people, new school.

809
01:05:56,743 --> 01:05:58,004
lt's not?

810
01:05:58,961 --> 01:06:01,396
No, what's hard is growing up
in a place...

811
01:06:01,613 --> 01:06:04,483
...where the cops don't
even want to be after dark.

812
01:06:05,787 --> 01:06:08,265
What's hard is knowing
that you're safe there...

813
01:06:08,613 --> 01:06:11,091
...because the people
you need to worry about...

814
01:06:11,309 --> 01:06:13,222
...know you got nothing
to give them.

815
01:06:14,004 --> 01:06:16,048
So it's a good thing you're here.

816
01:06:17,874 --> 01:06:21,743
Yeah, but these people don't think
l got anything to give them either.

817
01:06:22,352 --> 01:06:25,570
Don't let me get by you.
Once l get by you, l'll score.

818
01:06:25,787 --> 01:06:27,439
-Okay.
-You ready?

819
01:06:27,657 --> 01:06:30,352
-Ready.
-Stay in front of me now.

820
01:06:30,526 --> 01:06:32,439
-All right?
-Okay.

821
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:36,961
l got by you, man.

822
01:06:37,135 --> 01:06:39,439
You're bigger than l am.

823
01:06:40,309 --> 01:06:42,091
You still got to play defense.

824
01:06:42,309 --> 01:06:43,874
How do l do that?

825
01:06:44,483 --> 01:06:47,265
How do you play--?
l'll show you one right here.

826
01:06:48,787 --> 01:06:50,048
Turn around.

827
01:06:50,917 --> 01:06:52,483
Turn around.

828
01:06:54,743 --> 01:06:56,048
Feel that?

829
01:06:56,483 --> 01:06:57,570
l feel it.

830
01:06:57,917 --> 01:07:01,613
l know where you'll go because
l can feel where you're gonna move.

831
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:03,743
All right, now try and move left.

832
01:07:05,961 --> 01:07:09,917
l'm still here. You can't get around
me because l feel you moving left.

833
01:07:10,135 --> 01:07:11,483
Try and go right.

834
01:07:14,091 --> 01:07:15,743
See, l'm still here.

835
01:07:16,004 --> 01:07:19,526
l feel when you try and go right.
So you can't go there neither.

836
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:21,265
Now try and get by me.

837
01:07:23,352 --> 01:07:24,787
Hold on.

838
01:07:25,874 --> 01:07:27,613
You gotta dribble first.

839
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:28,917
Dribble.

840
01:07:29,135 --> 01:07:32,048
Dribble. Okay. Like this?

841
01:07:32,265 --> 01:07:33,526
Yeah.

842
01:07:36,048 --> 01:07:38,048
-Sorry.
-Claire.

843
01:07:39,439 --> 01:07:40,657
Daddy.

844
01:07:41,048 --> 01:07:42,700
Some of our guests are leaving.

845
01:07:44,396 --> 01:07:47,004
l'll see you on Monday, okay?

846
01:07:59,396 --> 01:08:00,700
Oh, Claire.

847
01:08:01,657 --> 01:08:02,743
Yeah?

848
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,800
lt was Stamford.

849
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,480
Excuse me?

850
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,360
At the bar in London.

851
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:12,040
He's the one who
introduced Watson to Holmes.

852
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,440
Might save you some time
after everybody's done in there.

853
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,960
You know how long l worked on that?

854
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,840
''One season of faith's perfection''?

855
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,880
Feels like l worked on it
for two or three seasons.

856
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:38,120
Oh, you're in that place where
you can't even hear me.

857
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,200
Like l could ask why you
never moved from here...

858
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,720
-...and you wouldn't even get pissed--
-Paragraph three starts...

859
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:47,720
...with a conjunction, ''and.''

860
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,600
Never start a sentence
with a conjunction.

861
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,360
-Sure you can.
-Oh, no.

862
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:54,840
lt's a firm rule.

863
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,640
No, no, no, see...

864
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,360
...it was a firm rule.

865
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,240
lf you use a conjunction
at the start of a sentence...

866
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,120
...it can make it stand out a bit.

867
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:05,320
And that may be what the writer wants.

868
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,480
And what is the risk?

869
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,760
Well, the risk is doing it too much.

870
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:13,160
lt's a distraction. lt could
give the piece a run-on feeling.

871
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:16,380
But for the most part,
the rule on ''and'' or ''but''...

872
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:18,580
...at the start is still pretty shaky.

873
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:21,780
Even though it's taught
in many schools by many teachers.

874
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:24,860
Some of the best writers
have ignored that rule for years...

875
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,600
...including you.

876
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,600
Well, you've taken...

877
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,320
...something which was mine...

878
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,320
...and made it yours.

879
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,320
That's quite an accomplishment.

880
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,640
Thank you.

881
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:44,640
The title is still mine, isn't it?

882
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:47,960
l guess.

883
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:51,840
Now, it was the neighborhood
that changed. Not me.

884
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,520
l ain't seen nothing change.

885
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:55,040
You ''ain't seen nothing''?

886
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:58,920
What in the hell kind
of sentence is that? Huh?

887
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:02,380
When you're in here,
don't talk like you do out there.

888
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:05,780
l was messing with you, man.
lt was a joke.

889
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,480
l want to hear
about the neighborhood...

890
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,760
...back when people
still read your book.

891
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,280
What did you say?

892
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,320
Nothing.

893
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:25,920
You said, ''back when people
still read my book.''

894
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,040
Didn't you?

895
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,480
We have 24 copies.

896
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:40,760
But l'm sorry. They're checked out.

897
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,800
Oh. Well, thank you, anyway.

898
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,280
You're welcome.

899
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:52,920
Any luck?

900
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,680
Did you get on the waiting list?

901
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,920
Yeah, man, your book was checked out.

902
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,480
And yes...

903
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,560
...l did pay for dinner.

904
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:06,840
lt cost me $1 3,
so l guess you made your point.

905
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:11,720
l called to see what kind of
food you wanted, but it kept ringing.

906
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:14,360
l took the bell out 20 years ago.

907
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,480
Let me ask you something.

908
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:23,400
How come a guy like you...

909
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:28,720
...wastes his time reading
The National Enquirer?.

910
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,120
What's wrong with it?

911
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,480
l mean, it's trash, man.

912
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:35,520
You should be reading
the Times or something.

913
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,320
l read the Times for dinner.

914
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:38,960
But this....

915
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,840
This is my dessert.

916
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:44,660
They got a contest at school.
This writing thing.

917
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:47,340
-You ever enter one of those?
-Writing contest?

918
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:49,420
-Yeah.
-Once.

919
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:50,940
A long time ago.

920
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,140
Did you win?

921
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:54,700
Well, of course l won.

922
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:57,060
Like money or something?

923
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:00,160
The Pulitzer.

924
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,600
Oh.

925
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,360
The students have to read
in front of everybody.

926
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,960
What the hell's that got
to do with writing?

927
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,240
Writers write
so that readers can read.

928
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,920
Let someone else read it.

929
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:15,300
You ever read your own book?

930
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:18,140
ln public? Hell, no.

931
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:20,220
Barely read it in private.

932
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:25,620
You know those things you do,
that coffee-shop reading shit?

933
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,000
You know why they do it?

934
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,120
Sell books, l guess.

935
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,040
Because they want to get laid.

936
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,960
Really? Women will sleep with you
if you write a book?

937
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,920
Women will sleep with you
if you write a bad book.

938
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:42,240
-Did it ever happen to you?
-Sure.

939
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:47,780
Did you ever get married?

940
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:52,180
Not exactly a soup question, is it?

941
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:56,140
No. No, l never did.

942
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:00,500
l learned a few things
along the way...

943
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:05,340
...which might be of help with this
young lady you always talk about.

944
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:07,780
Like what?

945
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:12,660
The key to a woman's heart...

946
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:17,840
...is an unexpected gift
at an unexpected time.

947
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:19,960
You're giving me advice on women?

948
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:23,880
Unexpected gift, unexpected time.

949
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:24,680
This is so unexpected!

950
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:27,400
This is so unexpected!

951
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,680
Oh, Jamal.

952
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:34,760
lt's not a first printing
or anything, but....

953
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,480
Oh, my God.

954
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:39,440
-What happened?
-This is a signed copy.

955
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,960
l can't accept it.
lt must've cost a fortune.

956
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,240
lt didn't cost that much. Really.

957
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:47,920
Maybe the bookstore missed it.

958
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:52,140
Bookstores don't
usually miss this stuff.

959
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:55,460
How did you end up going to Mailor?

960
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:59,700
Mailor was originally
an all-boys school.

961
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:04,180
So my father did what anyone
in his position would do.

962
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:07,420
He got on the board
and changed the rules.

963
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:09,340
And every kid there knows it.

964
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:11,620
They would've done it anyway.

965
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:13,460
That doesn't change anything.

966
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:15,940
l'm still ''Dr. Spence's daughter.''

967
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:19,580
Jamal.

968
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:21,320
Yeah?

969
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,960
That night at my home,
after the game...

970
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:28,360
...when you were showing me
how to play basketball.

971
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,400
Was that all you were showing me?

972
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,840
Listen, l don't think
that's gonna work.

973
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,000
What?

974
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,080
That.

975
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,480
Why not?

976
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:45,620
Ask your father.

977
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:50,460
Jamal, l'm not asking for some
kind of prenuptial agreement here.

978
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:52,780
lt's just a question.

979
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:57,500
Why does everything have to be
so black and white with you?

980
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,180
l forgot what the question was.

981
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:05,220
You don't forget anything,
Mr. Stamford.

982
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:19,980
You don't think he wrote it?

983
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:22,260
That's a serious accusation, Robert.

984
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:24,820
You come to the board
with something like this....

985
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:27,060
l'm aware of how serious it is.

986
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:28,860
lt's remarkable work.

987
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:31,020
You recognize any of it?

988
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,560
lt smacks of something.

989
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:38,080
But l don't know.

990
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,280
The boy does well in my class.

991
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:43,120
He had good scores coming in.

992
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,720
Maybe all he needed was direction.

993
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,880
Carl, he's a basketball player...

994
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,000
...from the Bronx.

995
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:53,240
Who just happens
to have won 1 7 straight...

996
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,840
...for a school that likes winning.

997
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:01,000
Robert, have you considered
that he might just be that good?

998
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:07,920
Not this good.

999
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:01,040
Do you know what
the absolute best moment is?

1000
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,860
lt's when you've finished
your first draft...

1001
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:08,340
...and you read it by yourself.

1002
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:12,820
Before these assholes
take something...

1003
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:15,340
...that they couldn't do
in a lifetime...

1004
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:17,940
...and tear it down in a single day.

1005
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,280
People love that book, man.

1006
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,880
l didn't write it for them.

1007
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:29,480
And when the critics
started all this bullshit...

1008
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:34,200
...about what it was
l was really trying to say....

1009
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:37,240
Well, l decided then...

1010
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,600
...one book was enough.

1011
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:44,280
William, that was 50 years ago, man.

1012
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:06,760
William.

1013
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:00,080
William, l actually spent money
on these tickets. Come on.

1014
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,840
ls it still light outside?

1015
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,280
lt's nighttime, man.

1016
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:12,720
Well?

1017
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,880
You look good, man.
lt's not the latest stuff out--

1018
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:20,320
l wasn't asking how l look.
l was asking, are we ready to go?

1019
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,640
Oh, yeah. Come on, man.

1020
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,280
Let's go.

1021
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,000
Come on.

1022
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,400
We're playing here in two weeks.

1023
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,320
l said we're playing in two weeks.
State tournament.

1024
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,760
Come on.

1025
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:12,640
Hold on. They got programs.
Let me get a program.

1026
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,200
William.

1027
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:45,720
Yo, William!

1028
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:48,600
Damn.

1029
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:00,960
William!

1030
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,400
Hey, William!

1031
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:57,840
William.

1032
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,280
Come on, let's get you out of here.

1033
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
l got you.

1034
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:40,060
You used to get out, right?

1035
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:42,540
Yeah, a long time ago.

1036
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:45,020
-What happened?
-How the hell should l know?

1037
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:47,100
l didn't keep track of the time.

1038
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:49,380
Sorry for losing you back there.

1039
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:50,740
No apology needed.

1040
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:54,740
Good, because l got one more place.
lt's quiet and it's on the way home.

1041
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:02,780
You only got 1 0 minutes.

1042
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:04,340
-All right.
-Keep it going.

1043
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:06,820
-Take that. lt's all good.
-Thanks a lot.

1044
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:22,840
Ground level.

1045
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,440
House that Ruth built.

1046
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:35,000
Why did you bring me here?

1047
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:38,360
Because it's your birthday, man.

1048
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:42,200
l looked it up in the almanac.

1049
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,920
They don't even have you
in the dead people section yet.

1050
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:53,400
l figure with all
the games you watched...

1051
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:59,600
...with whoever you watched them with,
you never got down this close.

1052
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:04,000
-What the hell are they doing?
-What you worried about, man?

1053
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:07,640
You acting like they gonna play
a World Series championship game.

1054
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:08,760
Relax.

1055
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:13,940
My brother and l,
we were here for every game.

1056
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:17,540
Till he left for the war.

1057
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:22,860
l thought it'd be the same
when he came back...

1058
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:27,360
...but he talked a little less...

1059
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:29,320
...and drank a little more.

1060
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,080
l promised my mother l would
help him get through it all.

1061
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:42,200
So l caught up with him
this one night...

1062
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,280
...and l was already
half a dozen drinks behind.

1063
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,320
So we had a few more.

1064
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:52,560
And after a while
he tells me he wants...

1065
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:54,920
...to drive me back to the apartment.

1066
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:58,020
l said, ''No, thanks.''

1067
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:02,340
We were all still living there then.

1068
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:06,300
l just stood there...

1069
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:10,120
...and watched him drive off.

1070
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:16,520
Makes it through
the whole goddamn war...

1071
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,320
...and l let him drive.

1072
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,360
Later that night...

1073
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:29,880
...the nurse was typing
whatever it is they type...

1074
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:32,640
...and you know what she tells me?

1075
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:38,600
She tells me how much
my book meant to her.

1076
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:42,800
My brother's getting cold
in the next room...

1077
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,520
...and all she can talk
about is a book.

1078
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,520
Well...

1079
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:53,440
...everything changed from then on.

1080
01:27:55,880 --> 01:28:00,920
Within five months,
l buried him, my ma, my father.

1081
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,680
All of them here...

1082
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:05,400
...in the Bronx.

1083
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:13,280
We'd spent our summers here.

1084
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:17,480
And if we were lucky, the fall.

1085
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:20,280
A lot of falls with those teams.

1086
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,760
Yeah, well...

1087
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:25,400
...not enough.

1088
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:28,680
''The rest of those
who have gone before us...

1089
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:32,000
...cannot steady
the unrest of those...

1090
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:33,960
...to follow.''

1091
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,600
You wrote that in your book.

1092
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:09,120
Jamal, l realize that
if l give you enough time...

1093
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:13,200
...you'll find a way to amaze even me.

1094
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,320
Does he know?

1095
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,760
No, he doesn't know.

1096
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:24,760
This was one of the best evenings
l've had in quite some time.

1097
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:27,420
All of it?

1098
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:31,020
Yes, all of it.

1099
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:32,300
Well, l....

1100
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:43,740
This guy, man.

1101
01:29:45,020 --> 01:29:47,140
How do you say you know
this guy again?

1102
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:49,940
-He's my teacher.
-Oh, yeah?

1103
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:53,940
Seems like a different kind of dude.

1104
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:03,340
Anyone in particular?

1105
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:07,660
l sometimes come here in the morning.

1106
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:11,380
Just me, the aspiring...

1107
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:12,980
...and all of them.

1108
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:20,320
l got a note saying
l should come and see you.

1109
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:23,840
Mr. Wallace...

1110
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:27,240
...l think it's time you and l
had a very honest...

1111
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:30,560
...and very open discussion
about your writing.

1112
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:33,420
l thought you liked it.

1113
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,500
Your recent work?

1114
01:30:36,580 --> 01:30:38,380
l liked it very much.

1115
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:43,540
No, Mr. Wallace, the question
concerning your most recent work...

1116
01:30:43,740 --> 01:30:45,580
...isn't whether it's good.

1117
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:49,540
lt's whether it's too good.

1118
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:53,380
The speed in your progress...

1119
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:56,940
...from your old school
to this one is unusual.

1120
01:30:57,220 --> 01:31:00,820
To the point that l must draw
one of two conclusions.

1121
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:07,380
Either you've been blessed with a rare
gift that has suddenly kicked in...

1122
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:09,260
...or...

1123
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:14,660
...you're getting your inspiration
from elsewhere.

1124
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:19,460
Given your previous education
and your background...

1125
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:23,260
...l'm sure you'll forgive me
for reaching my own conclusions.

1126
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:25,060
l wrote those papers, man.

1127
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:27,260
Then you won't mind showing me.

1128
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:30,900
The next assignment
is due in two weeks.

1129
01:31:31,180 --> 01:31:34,260
l'll schedule some time
for you to come to my office.

1130
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:37,940
l'd like you to write it there.

1131
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:45,040
ln the meantime, if there's anything
you wish to talk about....

1132
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:48,400
l'm not writing anything, man.

1133
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:50,840
Which proves what?

1134
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:55,120
lf a two-comma kid wrote the papers,
would he use this ''background'' shit?

1135
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:57,080
-Two-comma kid?
-A million dollars.

1136
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,640
-One comma, two commas.
-No.

1137
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,400
No, l don't.

1138
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:05,560
Do you know what people
are most afraid of?

1139
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:08,960
-What?
-What they don't understand.

1140
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:13,160
When we don't understand,
we turn to our assumptions.

1141
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,760
Crawford cannot understand...

1142
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:19,320
...how a black kid from the Bronx
can write the way you do.

1143
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:21,720
So he assumes you can't.

1144
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:26,060
Just like l assume he's an asshole.

1145
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:28,700
You knew him, didn't you?

1146
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:30,140
Crawford?

1147
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:31,620
No.

1148
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:34,300
But he thought he knew me.

1149
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:36,780
So what's all this stuff
about his book?

1150
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:40,500
A lot of writers know
the rules about writing...

1151
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:44,140
-...but don't know how to write.
-So?

1152
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:48,380
So Crawford wrote a book
about four authors who did know.

1153
01:32:48,580 --> 01:32:50,660
And l was the only one still alive.

1154
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:54,580
-And?
-He convinced a publisher to buy it.

1155
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:59,020
So l made a polite telephone call...

1156
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:02,100
...to this publisher,
telling him and others...

1157
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:05,580
...that l was in the process
of writing a second book.

1158
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:08,500
And if they wished to bid on it--

1159
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:11,740
Oh, so that's why
Crawford's book went away.

1160
01:33:12,660 --> 01:33:15,180
But you knew there wouldn't
be a second book.

1161
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:16,820
Yeah, but they didn't.

1162
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:28,260
lnteresting what happens when
the resources aren't close at hand.

1163
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:11,980
The rich tradition of handing
in competition entries...

1164
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:14,500
...on the final day continues...

1165
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:17,420
...for yet another year.

1166
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:26,080
Ladies and gentlemen...

1167
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:28,600
...may l have your attention...

1168
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,480
...please, if you don't mind.

1169
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:35,000
''Ere sin could blight or sorrow fade

1170
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,120
Death came with friendly care

1171
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:40,700
The opening bud to heaven convey'd--''

1172
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:42,700
How nice of you to join us.

1173
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:45,260
That's not part of the poem.

1174
01:34:46,740 --> 01:34:49,740
''And bade it blossom there.''
Anyone?

1175
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:55,420
A little more early morning
reticence than usual.

1176
01:34:56,180 --> 01:34:57,580
Mr. Coleridge.

1177
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:02,220
Please.

1178
01:35:02,820 --> 01:35:04,140
Mr. Coleridge...

1179
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:07,860
...how many students would you say
we have here today?

1180
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:11,780
l'm not sure.

1181
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:16,380
Perhaps you could
humor us with a guess.

1182
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:19,260
-Thirty?
-Thirty.

1183
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:23,740
And of that 30, there isn't one person
who knows the author of that passage.

1184
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:28,420
l find that remarkable.
Don't you, Mr. Coleridge?

1185
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:31,460
Perhaps we should back into this.

1186
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:36,660
ln looking at this, what, if any,
conclusions might we be able to draw?

1187
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:40,260
You mean about the author?

1188
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:42,020
About anything.

1189
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:47,900
Do any of the words
strike you as unusual?

1190
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:55,940
Feel free to view this as
the appropriate time for a response.

1191
01:35:58,140 --> 01:35:59,100
''Ere.''

1192
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:01,340
''Ere.'' And why is that unusual?

1193
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:05,020
Because...

1194
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:07,260
...it sounds old.

1195
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:09,260
lt does sound old, doesn't it?

1196
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:12,900
And you know why
it sounds old, Mr. Coleridge?

1197
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:17,740
Because it is old.
More than 200 years old.

1198
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:21,980
Written before your father was born,
before your father's father was born.

1199
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:24,580
But that still does not
excuse the fact...

1200
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:29,460
...that you don't know who wrote it,
now does it, Mr. Coleridge?

1201
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,520
l'm sorry, sir, l don't--

1202
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,920
You, of all people in this room,
should know who wrote that passage.

1203
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:40,400
And do you know why, Mr. Coleridge?

1204
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:43,400
l repeat, do you know why?

1205
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:45,440
Just say your name, man.

1206
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:51,640
Did you have something
to contribute, Mr. Wallace?

1207
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:56,160
l just said that
he should say his name.

1208
01:36:56,360 --> 01:37:00,080
And why would it be helpful
for Mr. Coleridge to say his name?

1209
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,280
Because that's who wrote it.

1210
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:04,560
Very good, Mr. Wallace.

1211
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:08,400
Perhaps your skills...

1212
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:12,000
...do extend a bit farther
than basketball.

1213
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:16,960
lf we can turn to page--
You may be seated, Mr. Coleridge.

1214
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:20,840
Turn to page 1 20
in the little blue book that--

1215
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:21,960
Further.

1216
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:25,520
l'm sorry?

1217
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:27,560
Don't.

1218
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:33,800
You said my skills extend ''farther''
than the basketball court.

1219
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:38,800
''Farther'' relates to distance.
''Further'' is a definition of degree.

1220
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:43,760
-You should have said ''further.''
-Are you challenging me, Mr. Wallace?

1221
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:46,640
No more than you challenged Coleridge.

1222
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:50,200
Perhaps the challenge
should have been directed elsewhere.

1223
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,580
''lt is a melancholy truth that even--''

1224
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:56,780
''--great men have poor relations.''

1225
01:37:57,380 --> 01:37:58,660
Dickens.

1226
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:02,340
''You will hear the beat of--''

1227
01:38:02,540 --> 01:38:03,620
Kipling.

1228
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:07,300
-''All great truths begin--''
-Shaw.

1229
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:10,340
-''Man is the only animal--''
-''--that blushes...

1230
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:12,940
''...or needs to.''

1231
01:38:15,740 --> 01:38:18,260
lt's Mark Twain.
Come on, Professor Crawford--

1232
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:20,700
Get out!

1233
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:24,660
Get out.

1234
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:34,220
Yeah. l'll get out.

1235
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,660
-Leave it alone.
-Hold on, please.

1236
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:52,300
So they kick you out
if you know something here?

1237
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:54,540
You don't know what Crawford will do.

1238
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:56,920
You're right about that.

1239
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:59,600
Jamal!

1240
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:04,120
-Do you think you should apologize?
-No.

1241
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,080
-Do you?
-No.

1242
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:10,760
You did nothing wrong.
Just beat him at his own game.

1243
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:12,520
But...

1244
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:16,000
...it would be a good time
to be careful.

1245
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,160
Careful? Careful about what?

1246
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:24,760
You have a gift that will allow you to
do remarkable things with your life.

1247
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,760
That is, if you don't screw it up...

1248
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:31,280
...by being a 1 6-year-old
right now.

1249
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:42,040
-Jamal.
-Yeah.

1250
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:45,040
-You got a call from the office.
-All right.

1251
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:53,040
Mr. Wallace. Please.

1252
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:59,960
As you know, Professor Matthews
is on the faculty board.

1253
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:03,440
And Dr. Spence is chair
of the trustees board.

1254
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:07,040
We've been reviewing the writing
competition submissions.

1255
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:11,600
We were hoping you might clarify some
points concerning your submission.

1256
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:15,280
''A Season of Faith's Perfection.''

1257
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:18,080
Your piece, correct?

1258
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:20,560
Yeah, that's it.

1259
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:24,840
Mr. Wallace, it is standard policy
with us to ask students...

1260
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:27,640
...if they wish to credit
any source material...

1261
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:31,720
...or acknowledge any other writers
when turning in an assignment.

1262
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:34,840
Do you wish to do that?

1263
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,000
1 960.

1264
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:46,960
An essay titled
''Baseball's Best Year''...

1265
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:53,000
...with a subtitle that reads
''A Season of Faith's Perfection.''

1266
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:57,560
Published in The New Yorker
and written by...

1267
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:00,280
...one William Forrester.

1268
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:06,520
Your version is actually
quite original...

1269
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:10,120
...but there is the title
and first paragraph to consider.

1270
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:12,800
lsn't there?

1271
01:41:14,540 --> 01:41:17,180
Jamal, either you happen to have...

1272
01:41:17,380 --> 01:41:21,540
...the permission
of William Forrester, or....

1273
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:24,540
Have you some other explanation?

1274
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:25,700
No.

1275
01:41:27,580 --> 01:41:28,620
That's my paper.

1276
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:31,920
Well, then,
your entry is now withdrawn...

1277
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:34,840
...and it becomes a matter
for the board to consider.

1278
01:41:37,220 --> 01:41:41,820
The board does have the authority
to place you on academic probation...

1279
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:46,500
...which would, among other things,
prevent you from playing basketball.

1280
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:53,900
Since the board doesn't meet
till next week...

1281
01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:56,660
...you can play in this
weekend's state championship.

1282
01:41:56,860 --> 01:42:00,900
But l have to warn you, the board has
a history of taking these matters...

1283
01:42:01,740 --> 01:42:03,340
...quite seriously.

1284
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:06,640
So we would like to suggest
what we feel...

1285
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:09,720
...is a solution that
may satisfy these concerns.

1286
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:12,280
Robert.

1287
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:16,880
What matters most is to ensure
this type of violation isn't repeated.

1288
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:19,040
So...

1289
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,360
...you will write an apology to the
students you took advantage of...

1290
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:26,400
...by submitting this piece.

1291
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:31,200
-You'll read it in front of my class.
-l'm not reading anything.

1292
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:35,640
Then l'm sure the board will consider
that when reviewing your scholarship.

1293
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:39,160
You haven't left us
with too many options, Jamal.

1294
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:40,920
Excuse me.

1295
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:59,080
Don't ever embarrass me
in front of my class.

1296
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:06,240
Please return the pen
when you're finished.

1297
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:16,920
No conventional greetings today?

1298
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:20,420
Why have me rewrite
something you published?

1299
01:43:20,620 --> 01:43:24,180
-Be careful where you take this.
-Why not tell me some magazine ran it?

1300
01:43:24,380 --> 01:43:25,900
Why the hell does it matter?

1301
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:27,860
Man, you should have told me.

1302
01:43:30,820 --> 01:43:32,060
What did you do with it?

1303
01:43:32,260 --> 01:43:33,780
l turned it in.

1304
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:37,940
l turned it in.
l had to show them something.

1305
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:42,100
You promised me anything we wrote
in here would stay in here.

1306
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:43,740
l know!

1307
01:43:47,940 --> 01:43:49,860
-l just thought--
-Shut up.

1308
01:43:55,740 --> 01:43:57,140
What are they telling you?

1309
01:43:59,860 --> 01:44:03,180
l go on probation unless l write
a letter saying l was wrong.

1310
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:04,740
Then write the letter.

1311
01:44:05,420 --> 01:44:07,220
l said l'm not writing anything.

1312
01:44:07,420 --> 01:44:10,940
You got him, he gets you.
Write the letter.

1313
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:13,060
And you'd let him do that?

1314
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:18,160
ls this supposed to be
another damn lesson?

1315
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:21,720
l'm tired of all these lessons
every time l come here.

1316
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:26,000
So your title's
at the top of my paper.

1317
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:29,520
-What's the lesson in that?
-l'm not the one who turned it in.

1318
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:32,240
Yeah, but you were the one
who just had to say:

1319
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:36,000
''Keep this one here because
it got printed in The New Yorker.''

1320
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:38,360
That's all you had to say, man.

1321
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:44,560
-l could use some help on this one.
-Oh, no. That's not an option.

1322
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:48,440
-You don't even have to go--
-l said that's not an option.

1323
01:44:49,140 --> 01:44:50,620
That's all right, man.

1324
01:44:52,180 --> 01:44:54,820
Got a nice history
of people not helping me.

1325
01:44:55,020 --> 01:44:58,180
Oh, Christ. Not that self-pity,
father bullshit.

1326
01:44:58,660 --> 01:45:00,100
What did you say?

1327
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:08,220
Man, fuck you, William!

1328
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:12,620
The real bullshit
is me taking it on this one...

1329
01:45:12,820 --> 01:45:14,660
...because you won't
walk out the door...

1330
01:45:14,820 --> 01:45:18,580
...and do something for somebody else.
You're too damn scared, man!

1331
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:21,220
That's the only damn reason.

1332
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:25,300
You don't know
a goddamn thing about reasons.

1333
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:27,060
There are no reasons!

1334
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:30,260
Reasons why some of us live
and why some of us don't.

1335
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:33,140
Fortunately, you have decades
to figure that out.

1336
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:38,100
What's the reason for having a cabinet
full of writing nobody ever reads?

1337
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:41,180
What is that, man?

1338
01:45:44,980 --> 01:45:46,700
l'm done with this shit.

1339
01:45:54,180 --> 01:45:55,940
Give him the ball again.

1340
01:45:56,140 --> 01:45:59,580
Oh, look. Jamal Wallace,
here to pay us a visit.

1341
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:04,340
What's up?

1342
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:07,220
-What's up, man?
-What's up, y'all?

1343
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:10,060
Come on.

1344
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:21,980
l know, l know. l've seen it.

1345
01:46:37,860 --> 01:46:40,020
How's your first game
in the Garden feel?

1346
01:46:42,220 --> 01:46:44,140
A little closer than l thought.

1347
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:49,320
That's why l thought it might be
a good time for us to talk.

1348
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:54,040
l know it's difficult handling classes
with the time you spend on the court.

1349
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:56,880
l couldn't handle that load.
Not at this school.

1350
01:46:57,200 --> 01:47:00,360
And maybe it was unfair of us
to ask you to do it.

1351
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:04,200
l talked to the board members
and to Crawford...

1352
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:06,200
...and...

1353
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:10,280
...we don't want to pursue this
any more than you do. Any of it.

1354
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:15,520
l'm here to present you with an offer.
We forget about the whole thing.

1355
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:18,680
Next year, your academic schedule
will be less demanding.

1356
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:20,560
You mean Crawford wanted that?

1357
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:25,120
Crawford wants what's best for you
and for the school.

1358
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:26,880
So, what am l supposed to do?

1359
01:47:27,880 --> 01:47:31,320
You hold up a championship trophy
at the end of this tournament.

1360
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:34,720
You make that happen,
l'll make the rest of it happen.

1361
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:36,360
All right?

1362
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,240
Now go finish up
what you came here to do.

1363
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:50,640
Let's go, Pilgrims!
Let's go, Pilgrims!

1364
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:53,360
Okay, let's go! Throw it to Jamal!

1365
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:23,320
Damn, man. Come on, man!

1366
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:26,320
Defense! Defense!

1367
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:40,640
Jamal, get the ball!

1368
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:02,320
Good pass, man. Good pass.
Get up there.

1369
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:10,560
Pick it up!

1370
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:23,840
Offensive foul! That way!

1371
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:26,760
Ten, gold. Offensive! That way.

1372
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:29,520
Okay, you got them now. Let's go.

1373
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:43,280
Time-out! Time-out!

1374
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:47,280
This is still our game.

1375
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:50,360
We make a stop here,
they'll have to put us on the line.

1376
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:54,760
When that happens, it's all over.
Don't lose your composure out there.

1377
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:57,320
lf they score,
we don't call a time-out.

1378
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:59,880
The ball goes to Hartwell or Wallace.

1379
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:02,680
Okay? Hartwell or Wallace.
Let's go, guys.

1380
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:05,000
Go!

1381
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:21,560
What's the score?

1382
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:25,260
lt ain't looking good, Ma.
lt ain't looking good.

1383
01:50:36,860 --> 01:50:39,740
Foul, 22 blue! Two shots.

1384
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:47,300
Foul's blue team, 22.
Hit, two. Go line up, guys.

1385
01:50:55,100 --> 01:50:56,500
Two shots.

1386
01:50:59,060 --> 01:51:01,300
Come on. We're gonna make these.

1387
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:02,780
l can't look.

1388
01:51:02,980 --> 01:51:04,820
lt's gonna be all right, Ma.

1389
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:15,940
Do it.

1390
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:24,940
Damn.

1391
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:33,780
One shot.

1392
01:52:02,260 --> 01:52:03,660
That's game.

1393
01:54:53,980 --> 01:54:55,340
Thank God!

1394
01:54:55,540 --> 01:54:57,820
He must have come in after we left.

1395
01:54:58,100 --> 01:54:59,180
Let him sleep.

1396
01:54:59,380 --> 01:55:03,460
-l'm gonna turn his bedroom light off.
-Turn it off and come on.

1397
01:55:09,020 --> 01:55:11,660
You started cleaning up
your room, Jamal.

1398
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:29,900
He looks very happy with himself,
that coyote. Look, ears down....

1399
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:50,560
Jamal, he wrote that for you.

1400
01:55:52,360 --> 01:55:53,440
When?

1401
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:55,320
After the game.

1402
01:55:55,720 --> 01:55:58,200
He's going back to the school
this morning.

1403
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:00,680
lt's funny, though.

1404
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:03,600
They always let you get but so far...

1405
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:06,200
...before they take
everything away from you.

1406
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:11,960
God, he's such a good kid, man. Then
he gets to come back to this shit.

1407
01:56:54,820 --> 01:56:56,260
That seat open?

1408
01:56:58,740 --> 01:56:59,900
l think so.

1409
01:57:01,260 --> 01:57:03,860
This isn't exactly
where l thought l'd find you.

1410
01:57:06,180 --> 01:57:07,940
This is still my school.

1411
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:12,540
They want me out,
they'll have to do it themselves.

1412
01:57:13,180 --> 01:57:14,300
They will.

1413
01:57:15,620 --> 01:57:16,860
Whatever.

1414
01:57:30,780 --> 01:57:33,940
''The winter's darkness and cold
is but a momentary prelude...

1415
01:57:34,140 --> 01:57:37,420
...to the new day of spring.
And while its grip seems endless...

1416
01:57:37,620 --> 01:57:41,100
...our perseverance proves equal.
We renew ourselves once again...

1417
01:57:41,700 --> 01:57:45,100
...seeking out the bright moments
that will serve--

1418
01:57:45,900 --> 01:57:48,660
That will serve therefore....

1419
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:53,860
Therefore serve as the foundation
of our future.''

1420
01:57:54,980 --> 01:57:56,220
Thank you.

1421
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:08,580
Professor Crawford...

1422
01:58:11,860 --> 01:58:14,500
...may l read a few words?

1423
01:58:19,220 --> 01:58:20,700
What's he doing here?

1424
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:24,060
Yes, of course...

1425
01:58:24,260 --> 01:58:26,020
...by all means.

1426
01:58:27,820 --> 01:58:29,580
Thank you, professor.

1427
01:58:44,140 --> 01:58:46,100
My name is...

1428
01:58:46,300 --> 01:58:47,940
...William Forrester.

1429
01:58:52,540 --> 01:58:53,860
Excuse me.

1430
01:58:59,260 --> 01:59:00,660
l'm that one.

1431
01:59:05,380 --> 01:59:07,420
''Losing Family.''

1432
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:09,580
''Losing family...

1433
01:59:09,780 --> 01:59:13,260
...obliges us to find our family.

1434
01:59:14,140 --> 01:59:16,900
Not always the family
that is our blood...

1435
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:19,960
...but the family
that can become our blood.

1436
01:59:21,400 --> 01:59:26,080
And should we have the wisdom
to open our door to this new family...

1437
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:29,600
...we will find that the wishes
we once had for the father...

1438
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:31,800
...who once guided us...

1439
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:35,560
...for the brother,
who once inspired us....

1440
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:15,120
--the only thing left to say will be:

1441
02:00:15,320 --> 02:00:19,240
'l wish l had seen this, or l wish
l had done that, or l wish--'''

1442
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:24,800
Most of you are too young...

1443
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:28,880
...to know what your wishes will be.

1444
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:32,720
But when l read these words...

1445
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:36,440
...words of hope and dreams...

1446
02:00:37,040 --> 02:00:39,640
...l realize that the one wish...

1447
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:44,080
...that was granted to me
so late in life...

1448
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:45,600
...was the gift of frien--

1449
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:47,280
Of friendship.

1450
02:00:50,360 --> 02:00:53,720
Mr. Forrester, l'm sure l speak
on behalf of everyone here...

1451
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:57,040
...in thanking you for this
unexpected visit.

1452
02:00:57,240 --> 02:01:00,600
The quality of your words...

1453
02:01:01,860 --> 02:01:04,940
...is something we should all
aspire to reach.

1454
02:01:06,660 --> 02:01:08,220
Mr. Forrester?

1455
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:12,020
Mr. Forrester, may l ask...

1456
02:01:12,220 --> 02:01:14,420
...to what do we owe this honor?

1457
02:01:15,820 --> 02:01:17,460
Professor Crawford...

1458
02:01:18,700 --> 02:01:20,500
...l spoke here today...

1459
02:01:20,700 --> 02:01:23,460
...because a friend of mine
wasn't allowed to.

1460
02:01:23,940 --> 02:01:27,940
A friend who had the integrity
to protect me...

1461
02:01:28,260 --> 02:01:31,700
...when l was unwilling
to protect him.

1462
02:01:33,380 --> 02:01:36,740
His name is Jamal Wallace.

1463
02:01:40,820 --> 02:01:42,980
Jamal Wallace is a friend of yours?

1464
02:01:43,180 --> 02:01:46,020
Yes. Yes, he is.

1465
02:01:47,140 --> 02:01:49,620
l helped him to find his own words...

1466
02:01:49,820 --> 02:01:52,020
...by starting with some of mine.

1467
02:01:52,220 --> 02:01:54,500
And in return, he promised...

1468
02:01:55,140 --> 02:01:58,540
...never to say anything to anybody
about me.

1469
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:02,120
A promise which he kept.

1470
02:02:03,120 --> 02:02:04,960
Mr. Forrester...

1471
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:07,440
...while your visit
appears to be heartfelt...

1472
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:09,760
...l'm sure you will appreciate...

1473
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:13,320
...that it will not change
or interfere...

1474
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:17,800
...with this institution reaching a
fair and proper decision in his case.

1475
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:21,160
There's one more issue here.

1476
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:25,320
Those words that l read today...

1477
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:28,480
...l didn't write them.

1478
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:30,640
Jamal Wallace did.

1479
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:42,560
Quiet.

1480
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:47,000
Quiet! Quiet, please!

1481
02:02:47,720 --> 02:02:48,680
Be still.

1482
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:53,840
Quiet, please.

1483
02:02:55,200 --> 02:02:57,440
That has no bearing...

1484
02:02:57,640 --> 02:02:59,240
...on the decision concerning--

1485
02:02:59,680 --> 02:03:03,080
As director of this competition,
l have final say in this matter.

1486
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:05,000
Robert, sit down.

1487
02:03:05,320 --> 02:03:08,320
l have been a teacher
for more than 30 years.

1488
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:12,360
That's long enough to know that
integrity counts for something.

1489
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:15,000
l'd say that Mr. Forrester...

1490
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:18,840
...has cleared up this matter
very nicely for us all.

1491
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:20,920
And as chairman
of the faculty board...

1492
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:23,560
...l have the last word
in that matter.

1493
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:27,880
Mr. Wallace, you are excused
from next week's board meeting.

1494
02:03:28,080 --> 02:03:29,640
Mr. Forrester...

1495
02:03:30,760 --> 02:03:34,280
...should you ever have an interest
in a teaching position....

1496
02:03:35,620 --> 02:03:36,660
No.

1497
02:03:38,660 --> 02:03:41,500
Jamal, these are your words?

1498
02:03:44,220 --> 02:03:45,940
Sixteen.

1499
02:03:46,900 --> 02:03:48,020
Remarkable.

1500
02:04:02,180 --> 02:04:03,140
Well done.

1501
02:04:16,220 --> 02:04:19,940
l'm thinking you'll make
your own decisions from here on.

1502
02:04:21,100 --> 02:04:24,780
l'm thinking you're about to say
something more like, ''l always could.''

1503
02:04:25,780 --> 02:04:28,140
No. No more lessons.

1504
02:04:28,340 --> 02:04:29,940
But l have a question, though.

1505
02:04:30,140 --> 02:04:33,460
Those two foul shots
at the end of the game...

1506
02:04:45,100 --> 02:04:46,380
...did you miss them?

1507
02:04:46,860 --> 02:04:48,300
Or did you miss them?

1508
02:04:38,380 --> 02:04:40,700
Not exactly a soup question, is it?

1509
02:04:43,420 --> 02:04:44,540
Let's go.

1510
02:04:47,020 --> 02:04:51,340
Do you think our vaudeville act today
will merit the National Enquirer?.

1511
02:04:51,660 --> 02:04:53,100
Yeah, definitely.

1512
02:04:54,620 --> 02:04:56,020
Whatever happens...

1513
02:04:56,220 --> 02:04:57,740
...l'm off.

1514
02:04:59,900 --> 02:05:03,340
What's the word that you and
your friends would use for that?

1515
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:04,780
Leaving?

1516
02:05:05,540 --> 02:05:06,500
Oh, God.

1517
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:08,780
Where are you off to?

1518
02:05:08,980 --> 02:05:12,260
l have a homeland l haven't seen
for too long.

1519
02:05:12,460 --> 02:05:13,620
You mean lreland.

1520
02:05:13,820 --> 02:05:15,460
Scotland, for God's sake.

1521
02:05:16,220 --> 02:05:18,100
l'm messing with you, man.

1522
02:05:20,620 --> 02:05:22,060
Be sure to write.

1523
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:55,020
-Hey, Jamal.
-What's up?

1524
02:05:58,460 --> 02:05:59,740
What's up, John?

1525
02:06:00,260 --> 02:06:01,860
You heard from William?

1526
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:04,480
Yeah, but l don't know
what he's doing.

1527
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:07,920
He keeps sending letters checking up
on these college recruiters.

1528
02:06:08,200 --> 02:06:11,200
l was just downstairs.
Looks like you got another one.

1529
02:06:11,400 --> 02:06:12,640
Word?

1530
02:06:12,920 --> 02:06:14,280
l'll see you around.

1531
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:19,320
Jamal?

1532
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:22,720
Steve Sanderson.

1533
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:24,160
-How you doing?
-Good.

1534
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:26,440
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

1535
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:29,760
No problem.
So, what school are you from?

1536
02:06:29,960 --> 02:06:32,480
Oh, no. l'm a lawyer here in town.

1537
02:06:32,680 --> 02:06:35,320
-l work with Roberts and Carter.
-Oh, a lawyer.

1538
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:38,080
Yeah, but congratulations with that.
That's great.

1539
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:40,760
That's really, really...great.

1540
02:06:41,860 --> 02:06:44,780
We got a bunch of the guys
in the office following you.

1541
02:06:46,180 --> 02:06:50,100
But we're the legal representation
for William Forrester.

1542
02:06:50,740 --> 02:06:51,980
How is he?

1543
02:06:52,220 --> 02:06:53,420
Here...

1544
02:06:53,620 --> 02:06:54,540
...sit down.

1545
02:07:01,180 --> 02:07:03,500
We've received word that William...

1546
02:07:03,700 --> 02:07:05,020
...passed away.

1547
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:16,720
l'm sorry.

1548
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:25,960
He wanted you to have...

1549
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:28,440
...these things right away.

1550
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:45,600
What happened?

1551
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:49,620
William had cancer.

1552
02:07:51,380 --> 02:07:53,740
They found it a couple years ago.

1553
02:08:06,140 --> 02:08:07,900
Jamal, this is crazy.

1554
02:08:08,100 --> 02:08:09,580
Oh, my God.

1555
02:08:09,780 --> 02:08:11,100
Wow!

1556
02:08:14,020 --> 02:08:17,180
-Look at all these books.
-Don't touch anything.

1557
02:09:37,860 --> 02:09:39,020
DearJamal:

1558
02:09:40,620 --> 02:09:43,740
Someone l once knew wrote that
we walk away from our dreams...

1559
02:09:43,940 --> 02:09:48,660
...afraid that we may fail,
or worse yet, afraid we may succeed.

1560
02:09:48,860 --> 02:09:53,260
While l knew so early
thatyou would realize your dreams...

1561
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:57,140
...l neverimagined
l would once again realize my own.

1562
02:09:58,060 --> 02:09:59,660
Seasons change, young man.

1563
02:09:59,860 --> 02:10:02,620
And while l waited
until the winter ofmy life...

1564
02:10:02,820 --> 02:10:05,180
...to see the things l've seen
this pastyear...

1565
02:10:05,380 --> 02:10:07,940
...there is no doubt
l would have waited too long...

1566
02:10:08,140 --> 02:10:09,860
...had it not been foryou.

1567
02:10:19,640 --> 02:10:21,560
You gonna be here a while, man?

1568
02:10:25,160 --> 02:10:27,360
Just can't watch the eyes this time.

1569
02:10:27,560 --> 02:10:29,760
You'll be okay, man. Come on.

1570
02:10:32,680 --> 02:10:34,000
Come on, man.

1571
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:37,040
Get up.

1572
02:11:30,020 --> 02:11:31,940
You're missing lay-ups now?

1573
02:11:33,020 --> 02:11:34,660
What happened to you, boy?

1574
02:11:38,660 --> 02:11:40,660
Where did the first step go, man?
