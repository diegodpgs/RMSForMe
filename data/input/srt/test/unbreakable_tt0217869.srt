1
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,237
This is Mr Mathison.
He's a doctor.

2
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,951
- Are you okay?
- An ambulance is on the way.

3
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,036
Thank you.

4
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,253
Is there a name yet?

5
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,506
Elijah.

6
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,055
Is he supposed
to be crying like this?

7
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:39,141
May I?

8
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,575
Can I have him back?

9
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,457
What happened during the delivery?

10
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,210
Nothing.
It was very quick.

11
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,462
The baby just wanted
to come right out.

12
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,547
And there were no problems.

13
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,010
Did you drop him?

14
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,095
What?

15
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,306
Did you drop this baby?

16
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,391
Jesus Christ, no.

17
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,566
Inform the ambulance
that we have a situation.

18
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,611
All right.
Molly.

19
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,531
I've never seen this.

20
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:42,371
It appears that your baby
has sustained some fractures...

21
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,456
while inside your uterus.

22
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,003
His arms and his legs are broken.

23
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,306
<i>This is Eastrail 177.</i>

24
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,516
<i>Next stop, Philadelphia.</i>

25
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,469
Are you alone?

26
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,223
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,479
Someone left this magazine.

28
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,565
Want to take a look at it?

29
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,650
Could I take a look at that one?

30
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,908
Thanks.

31
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,911
- You like sports?
- It's my field.

32
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,997
I represent athletes.
I'm an agent.

33
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:35,294
Are you looking for any
male synchronized swimmers?

34
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,172
- I'm thinking about getting into that.
- Is that right?

35
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,594
I'm afraid of water.

36
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,679
Think that's a problem?

37
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:56,106
You represent someone
in Philadelphia?

38
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,442
I'm meeting this player
from Temple University.

39
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,527
He's a cornerback.

40
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:04,364
This kid is 6'1 ", 210 pounds.

41
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:08,619
He runs a 40 in 4.3 seconds.
He's gonna be a god.

42
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,705
Do you like football?

43
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,790
Not really.

44
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,764
- I'm David Dunn.
- Kelly.

45
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,600
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

46
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,685
Nice-Nice to meet you.

47
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,862
How long are you gonna be
in Philadelphia?

48
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:55,123
- I'm married.
- Great.

49
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:58,043
- I'm sorry.
- What are you talking about?

50
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:03,090
I-

51
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:07,469
I think you misunderstood
what I was, uh...

52
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:09,721
- s-saying-
- I know.

53
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,643
I think I'm gonna find another seat.

54
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,187
I- I didn't mean, uh-

55
00:08:56,828 --> 00:09:00,123
<i>That's what he failed to realize.
I look classy, not trashy.</i>

56
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:05,045
<i>I look classy too. What about me?
Don't I look classy?</i>

57
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,548
<i>But I'm afraid you forgot this!</i>

58
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:11,802
<i>- And this! And-
- Where has you been, Banana?</i>

59
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,137
<i>Now I've got you, weasel.</i>

60
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:18,934
<i>Some cars are still on fire,
and the debris is everywhere.</i>

61
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,936
<i>We are not sure at this time, uh...</i>

62
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,522
<i>how rescue personnel will be able
to get on scene at all.</i>

63
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:26,191
<i>If you'rejust tuning in,
Eastrail train number 177...</i>

64
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:28,694
<i>has derailed
just outside Philadelphia.</i>

65
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,113
<i>And we're bringing you
live coverage from Skycam 4.</i>

66
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,532
<i>Yes, that is- It appears
to be a rescue ambulance...</i>

67
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,535
<i>and there are more behind it
I can see on the access road.</i>

68
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,121
<i>I don't know how close they're
gonna be able to get, David.</i>

69
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,999
<i>These are woods and, uh, trees.</i>

70
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,501
<i>It's gonna be a very
difficult rescue effort.</i>

71
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,603
Try to hack some of that off.

72
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,203
Hi. I'm Dr Dubin.

73
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:22,998
You're in the emergency room in
the Philadelphia City Hospital.

74
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,083
You were in a serious accident.

75
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,504
Look at me.

76
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,589
How are you feeling?

77
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,676
- Okay.
- Good.

78
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,221
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

79
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:41,099
Have you ever had any heart
or asthma problems in the past?

80
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:45,354
- No.
- Kidney or renal problems?

81
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,940
- No.
- Any allergies?

82
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,319
No.

83
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,117
Where were you sitting
on the train?

84
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,958
- Against the window.
- In the passenger car?

85
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,212
Yeah.

86
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:16,176
- Where are the other passengers?
- Was your family travelling with you?

87
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,764
No.

88
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,559
Did you get up from your seat?

89
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,234
Are you certain
you were in the passenger car?

90
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,491
Yes.

91
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,877
Why are you looking at me like that?

92
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,004
Your train derailed.

93
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,840
Some kind of malfunction.

94
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,885
They only found
two people alive so far-

95
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,970
you and this man.

96
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,684
His skull was cracked open and
most of his left side was crushed.

97
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,980
And to answer your question,
there are two reasons...

98
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,108
why I'm looking at you like this.

99
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:15,986
One, because it seems
in a few minutes...

100
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:20,365
that you will officially be
the only survivor of this train wreck.

101
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:23,368
And two...

102
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,454
because you didn't break one bone.

103
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:28,874
You don't have a scratch on you.

104
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,899
David?

105
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:23,488
What happened in New York?

106
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:27,701
I don't think I got the job.

107
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,706
I'm still going to, uh-

108
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,542
I'm still moving there.

109
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,628
Just-

110
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:40,756
Uh, just-just not now.

111
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:47,930
Good night.

112
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:53,060
Good night.

113
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,074
Sara Elaston...

114
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:10,327
social worker at
Broad and Locust Community Centre.

115
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,747
We pray for your soul.

116
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:19,044
Kevin Elliot, businessman...

117
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:22,005
father of six.

118
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,091
We pray for your soul.

119
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:27,845
Glen Stevens...

120
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:31,223
researcher in the area
of leukemia...

121
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,308
at Drexel University.

122
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,104
We pray for your soul.

123
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,066
Jennifer Pennyman...

124
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:45,320
third-grade teacher
at Jefferson Elementary.

125
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:49,533
We pray for your soul.

126
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,770
- Yes?
- Is Noel in, ma'am?

127
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,855
No, sir, he is not.

128
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:06,109
I read about you in the paper.

129
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:09,446
- What?
- I was in an accident once too.

130
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,533
A horse almost trampled me to death.

131
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,618
- Wow.
- Had him put down.

132
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,289
That's a sad story.

133
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:27,089
Could- Could you ask Noel
something for me, please?

134
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:29,341
Proceed.

135
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,468
Would you ask him to check
how many sick days I've taken...

136
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,679
since I've worked here?

137
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:36,640
- That the entire message?
- Yes, ma'am.

138
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:42,563
Thank you.

139
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,603
Hey, Noel.

140
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:24,938
What, you hit your head on that train?

141
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:27,024
Get your brain
to start working again?

142
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:31,278
- What?
- Forty dollars.

143
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:35,616
- Forty dollars what?
- You're gettin' a $40-a-week raise.

144
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,701
That's it.

145
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:42,039
I checked. You were right.
You've never taken a sick day.

146
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:45,834
Five years, no sick day.
I get it. You want a raise.

147
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:47,878
Smart way to make your point.

148
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:17,199
- Is Joseph okay?
- Yeah.

149
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,827
- He's asleep.
- Oh.

150
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:26,959
I wanted to ask you a question.

151
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,253
It's gonna sound a little strange,
but, uh...

152
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:32,297
just think about it
for a second, okay?

153
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:35,092
Okay.

154
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,344
When's the last time I was sick?

155
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,429
Do you remember?

156
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,977
Um, I-I don't know.

157
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,857
It's been a while.

158
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,735
I haven't been sick this year,
I know that.

159
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,946
Okay.

160
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,031
Do you remember me gettin' sick?

161
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,495
Um...

162
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:05,873
not a specific day.

163
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:08,167
And what's-what's this about?

164
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,006
Audrey, do you remember me
ever getting sick?

165
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,967
In the three years
we lived in this house?

166
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,136
In the old apartment?

167
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:22,181
Before Joseph was born?
Before we ever got married?

168
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,520
I- I can't remember.

169
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:32,733
Don't you think
that's kind of weird...

170
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:36,987
not remembering one cold
or a-a fever or a sore throat?

171
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:41,283
What do you think it means?

172
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:48,957
Um...

173
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:52,920
I think it means
I'm probably too tired to remember.

174
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:38,715
No more sittin' in this room.
I let it go on long enough.

175
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,969
I'm not goin' out there any more.
I'm not getting hurt again.

176
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:46,390
- This was the last time, I told you.
- You can't do anything about that.

177
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,809
You might fall between
this chair and that television.

178
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:51,895
If that's what God has planned for you,
that's what's gonna happen.

179
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:54,398
You can't hide from it
sittin' in a room.

180
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:02,281
They call me Mr Glass at school
because I break like glass.

181
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:09,413
You make this decision now...

182
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:12,833
to be afraid...

183
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:16,628
and you will never turn back.

184
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:23,177
Your whole life,
you will always be afraid.

185
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:40,527
- I got a present for you.
- Why?

186
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:44,239
Forget why.

187
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,827
You want it or not?

188
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:53,999
Well, go get it, then.

189
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:57,044
Where is it?

190
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:59,755
On a bench...

191
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,840
across the street.

192
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,898
Someone's gonna take it.

193
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,653
Then you better get out there soon.

194
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:39,104
I bought a whole bunch.

195
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:45,694
There'll be one of these
waitin' for you...

196
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,946
every time you want
to come out here.

197
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:57,789
They say this one
has a surprise ending.

198
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:09,718
This is from Fritz Campion's
own library.

199
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:14,723
This is before the first issue of
the comic book hit the stands in 1968.

200
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:18,852
It's a classic depiction
of good versus evil.

201
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:22,940
Notice the square jaw of Slayer,
common in most comic heroes.

202
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:26,777
And the slightly disproportionate size
of Jaguaro's head to his body.

203
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,948
This again is common,
but only in villains.

204
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:33,450
The thing to notice about this piece...

205
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:37,538
the thing that makes it
very, very special...

206
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:40,707
is its realistic depiction
of its figures.

207
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:42,835
When the characters
reached the magazine...

208
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:45,003
they were exaggerated...

209
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:47,339
as always happens.

210
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:51,176
This is vintage.

211
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:56,056
Well...

212
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:03,647
wrap it up.

213
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,149
You've made a considerably
wise decision.

214
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:13,574
Well, my kid's gonna go berserk.

215
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:19,163
Once again, please?

216
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:22,040
My son Jeb-
it's a gift for him.

217
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:25,002
- How old is Jeb?
- He's four.

218
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:30,090
No.

219
00:26:30,174 --> 00:26:33,927
No, no, no, no, no.

220
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:37,806
You need to go. Now.

221
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,727
What'd-What'd I say?

222
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:45,147
Do you see any Teletubbies in here?

223
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,274
Do you see a slender plastic tag
clipped to my shirt...

224
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:49,526
with my name printed on it?

225
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,529
Did you see a little Asian child with
a blank expression sitting outside...

226
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:56,366
in a mechanical helicopter that shakes
when you put quarters in it?

227
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,078
No? Well, that's what
you see at a toy store...

228
00:27:00,162 --> 00:27:02,164
and you must think
you're in a toy store because...

229
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:05,792
you're here shopping
for an infant named Jeb.

230
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:08,879
Now, one of us
has made a gross error...

231
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:12,174
and wasted the other person's
valuable time.

232
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,384
This is an art gallery,
my friend...

233
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:18,222
and this is a piece of art.

234
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,572
We're by appointment only.

235
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:39,952
- I got a card from this store.
- Congratulations.

236
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:43,664
You have a mailbox.
The exhibition isn't for two weeks.

237
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:46,583
This one was under
the windshield wiper of my car.

238
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:52,548
How certain are you that
you've never taken ill?

239
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:55,175
Seventy-five percent.

240
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:58,720
Well, that's not
certain at all, is it?

241
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:03,058
That's hole number one.

242
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:06,353
I'm going to be extremely skeptical
about all this.

243
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:08,438
About all what?

244
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,151
I'm assuming you've never been injured.
Would I be wrong in that assumption?

245
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:15,237
Dad's been injured.

246
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:19,533
Is the child correct?

247
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:23,745
Yes, sir. In college,
I was in a car accident.

248
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:28,709
- Was it serious?
- He couldn't play football any more.

249
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:30,794
That's hole number two.

250
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:34,590
That's a big one.

251
00:28:38,177 --> 00:28:42,139
Mr Price, can we talk about
the note that you left on my car?

252
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:45,475
I've studied the form
of comics intimately.

253
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:47,603
I've spent a third of my life
in a hospital bed...

254
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:50,856
with nothing else to do but read.

255
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:52,941
I believe comics
are our last link...

256
00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:56,737
to an ancient way
of passing on history.

257
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,989
The Egyptians drew on walls.

258
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:03,327
Countries all over the world still pass
on knowledge through pictorial forms.

259
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,579
I believe comics
are a form of history...

260
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:09,249
that someone somewhere
felt or experienced.

261
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,668
Then, of course,
those experiences and that history...

262
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:14,796
got chewed up in the commercial
machine, got jazzed up...

263
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,758
made titillating,
cartooned for the sale rack.

264
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:22,554
This city has seen its share
of disasters.

265
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:25,140
I watched the aftermath
of that plane crash.

266
00:29:25,224 --> 00:29:27,768
I watched the carnage
of the hotel fire.

267
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:32,773
I watched the news waiting to hear
a very specific combination of words...

268
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:35,359
but they never came.

269
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:39,196
Then one day I saw a news story
about a train accident...

270
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,323
and I heard them.

271
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:43,492
"There is a sole survivor...

272
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:46,703
and he is miraculously unharmed. "

273
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:53,168
I have something called
osteogenesis imperfecta.

274
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:55,254
It's a genetic disorder.

275
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:57,339
I don't make a particular
protein very well...

276
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:59,967
and it makes my bones
very low in density.

277
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,344
Very easy to break.

278
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:04,972
I've had 54 breaks in my life...

279
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:09,852
and I have the tamest version
of this disorder, type one.

280
00:30:09,935 --> 00:30:13,647
There are type two,
type three, type four.

281
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,732
Type fours don't last very long.

282
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,362
So that's how it popped into my head.

283
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:23,282
If there is someone
like me in the world...

284
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:25,617
and I'm at one end
of the spectrum...

285
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:27,744
couldn't there be someone else...

286
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:30,080
the opposite of me
at the other end?

287
00:30:30,164 --> 00:30:34,543
Someone who doesn't get sick, who
doesn't get hurt like the rest of us?

288
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:38,422
And he probably
doesn't even know it.

289
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:43,719
The kind of person
these stories are about.

290
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:48,932
A person put here
to protect the rest of us.

291
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:51,101
To guard us.

292
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,108
- You think my dad's a real-
- I don't think anything right now.

293
00:30:58,192 --> 00:31:00,652
It's a possibility-

294
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:02,738
one with many holes.

295
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:08,952
Joseph, don't take
another sip of that water.

296
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:14,208
- Go throw it in the trash.
- But Dad-

297
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:16,293
Do it now, please.

298
00:31:25,928 --> 00:31:29,556
I see guys like you
all the time in my work.

299
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,143
You find someone you want
to take advantage of...

300
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:36,688
you tell them a fantastic story...

301
00:31:36,772 --> 00:31:39,650
and somewhere in there you say it:

302
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:42,694
"I just need
your credit card number...

303
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:44,780
a small down payment. "

304
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:49,451
This morning was the first morning
that I could remember...

305
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:51,537
that I didn't open my eyes
and feel...

306
00:31:54,373 --> 00:31:56,500
sadness.

307
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:03,257
I thought the person that wrote
that note had an answer for me.

308
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,225
I'm gonna leave now.

309
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:15,310
Good luck with your exhibition.

310
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:17,896
So, what kind of job
do you have, David?

311
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,023
You said you've met guys like me
in your work.

312
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:24,695
- What exactly is it that you do?
- I work at the University Stadium.

313
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:27,364
I'm a security guard.

314
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:45,252
Hi.

315
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:48,172
I've come to a decision.

316
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:50,632
Okay.

317
00:34:50,716 --> 00:34:53,260
I just wanna ask you something, okay?

318
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:56,889
And you can be totally honest.

319
00:34:56,972 --> 00:35:00,601
I'm prepared for any answer,
and-and it won't affect me.

320
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:05,981
Have you been with anyone?

321
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:08,317
I mean, since we've
been having problems.

322
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,402
The answer won't affect me.

323
00:35:13,614 --> 00:35:16,283
I just need to know, you know?

324
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:18,368
I mean, it won't affect me
either way.

325
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:22,789
No.

326
00:35:30,672 --> 00:35:32,925
Sorry, David.
I'm sorry.

327
00:35:38,222 --> 00:35:40,390
Anyway...

328
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:42,476
my decision is...

329
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:47,731
that I want to start again.

330
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,112
And I want it to be
like it was in the beginning.

331
00:35:57,491 --> 00:36:00,828
And it's a big deal that
you walked away from that train.

332
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:05,833
I feel like it's a second chance.

333
00:36:12,047 --> 00:36:15,300
And if you feel like
asking me out sometime...

334
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:17,386
that'd be okay.

335
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:21,849
Okay.

336
00:36:34,528 --> 00:36:37,072
<i>- Dunn.
- Go for Dunn.</i>

337
00:36:37,156 --> 00:36:41,451
<i>Yeah, it's Jenkins. Look, we got a guy
over at gate 17-C with a bogus ticket.</i>

338
00:36:41,535 --> 00:36:45,581
<i>Says he knows you.
He won't tell me his name.</i>

339
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:48,375
What's he look like?

340
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:50,669
Why is it, do you think, that
of all the professions in the world...

341
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:52,754
you chose protection?

342
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,634
- You are a very strange man.
- You could have been a tax accountant.

343
00:36:57,718 --> 00:37:00,596
You could have owned your own gym. You
could've opened a chain of restaurants.

344
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:03,098
You could've done
one of 10,000 things.

345
00:37:03,182 --> 00:37:07,311
But in the end,
you chose to protect people.

346
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:09,897
You made that decision,
and I find that...

347
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,982
very, very interesting.

348
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:16,195
Now all I need is
your credit card number.

349
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:19,323
That last part was a joke.

350
00:37:23,494 --> 00:37:27,998
- You're a big sports fan, are you?
- It's starting to intrigue me.

351
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:31,710
It gets heaviest
ten minutes before kickoff.

352
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:46,391
Programme here.
Programme.

353
00:37:46,475 --> 00:37:48,477
Programme.

354
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:54,066
Programme. Programme here.

355
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:56,151
- Rich, why don't we pat down?
- Right.

356
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:58,237
- Just give me a minute.
- Is there a problem?

357
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,322
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to search you.

358
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:03,784
- It's nothing personal.
- The tall guy in the camouflage jacket.

359
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:08,413
Sometimes people carry weapons in here,
and they drink too much.

360
00:38:08,497 --> 00:38:13,168
If the team's not doing good,
bad things can happen.

361
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:16,505
We do pat-downs of the crowd
to discourage people from carrying.

362
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:20,551
If he's carrying,
he'll step out of line.

363
00:38:33,689 --> 00:38:35,691
Yeah, step right up here.

364
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:49,621
Okay. I got you a seat up
in the yellow section.

365
00:38:49,705 --> 00:38:54,543
It's in the nosebleeds,
but at least you won't get spit on.

366
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:56,879
- All right.
- How'd you know that guy you bumped...

367
00:38:56,962 --> 00:38:58,964
was carrying a weapon?

368
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:03,343
I don't know.

369
00:39:03,427 --> 00:39:07,848
Maybe it was that camouflage
army jacket he was wearing.

370
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:10,684
Those guys like to carry
hunting knives and stuff for show.

371
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:14,146
You thought he was carrying a knife?

372
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:17,316
- I thought he was carrying something, yeah.
- But not a knife.

373
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:25,908
I got a picture of a silver gun
with a black grip...

374
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:28,243
tucked in his pants.

375
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:30,704
You know, like on TV.

376
00:39:32,164 --> 00:39:35,000
You have good instincts
for things like that?

377
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:38,504
- Like what?
- Knowing when people have done something wrong?

378
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:45,135
- Yeah.
- Have you ever tried to develop it?

379
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:51,183
- I don't know what you're asking me.
- Your skill.

380
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:53,435
Look, I gotta be down on
the sidelines during the game.

381
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:55,771
- You can get to your seat right down-
- Characters in comics...

382
00:39:55,854 --> 00:39:58,357
are often attributed special powers-

383
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,903
invisibility, X-ray vision,
things of that sort.

384
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:05,572
Okay.

385
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:10,285
- I don't wanna play this game any more.
- It's an exaggeration of the truth.

386
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:15,582
Maybe it's based on something
as simple as instinct.

387
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:18,293
- But he might not have been carrying anything.
- But he might have been carrying...

388
00:40:18,377 --> 00:40:21,255
a silver gun with a black grip
tucked in his pants.

389
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:24,174
<i>- Dunn.
- I gotta go.</i>

390
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:28,846
Yeah, I know.
I'll be right down.

391
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:32,140
- One last question.
- What?

392
00:40:32,224 --> 00:40:34,601
That car accident you were in.

393
00:40:34,685 --> 00:40:36,687
Was there anyone else involved?

394
00:40:38,897 --> 00:40:42,234
Yeah.
My wife, Audrey.

395
00:40:42,317 --> 00:40:44,403
She was in the car with me.

396
00:40:46,488 --> 00:40:49,408
Have a good life, Elijah.

397
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:52,870
Next time, try to buy your tickets
at an authorized sales location.

398
00:40:52,953 --> 00:40:56,999
<i>- Dunn.
- I'm on my way.</i>

399
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:03,297
<i>...into the investigation
of train 177...</i>

400
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:06,550
<i>being conducted at the Eastrail
holding warehouses.</i>

401
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:09,178
<i>The city council has
stepped up plans to pass a bill...</i>

402
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:12,598
<i>requiring higher standards
for inspection and maintenance...</i>

403
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:15,350
<i>of all rail transportation
for Philadelphia...</i>

404
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:17,436
<i>and its outlying districts.</i>

405
00:41:25,194 --> 00:41:26,862
Hold up a second!

406
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:24,503
I just want to ask you something.

407
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:36,909
Dad! Hey, Dad!

408
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:45,834
Dad!

409
00:43:56,887 --> 00:44:00,641
Joseph, do you know how mad your mother would
be if she knew you were playing football?

410
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:03,560
Are you gonna tell?

411
00:44:03,644 --> 00:44:07,105
You wanna play last of the downs?
We got a big guy like you.

412
00:44:07,189 --> 00:44:11,318
You could play on opposite sides.
He's Potter's cousin.

413
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:13,946
He's starting cornerback
at Temple University.

414
00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:16,114
He's going pro in the draft.

415
00:44:16,198 --> 00:44:19,660
They say he can run the 40
in 4.3 seconds.

416
00:44:19,743 --> 00:44:21,662
Yeah, I've heard.

417
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:23,747
You can beat him, Dad.

418
00:44:23,831 --> 00:44:26,291
- Let's beat him.
- I'm gonna go in.

419
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:29,002
Just play one set of downs.
I told them you were great.

420
00:44:29,086 --> 00:44:31,088
- Why'd you do that?
- Just one.

421
00:44:31,171 --> 00:44:33,298
I'm gonna go in.
I've got some things to do.

422
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:36,176
- What things?
- I'm gonna work out.

423
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,886
- I'll help you.
- No, I-I don't need-

424
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:41,765
I can't play, guys!
I'm working out with my dad!

425
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:44,852
Go, go.
Here we go! Ready?

426
00:44:44,935 --> 00:44:48,146
Hut! You're doing good.
Right there! Catch!

427
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,524
<i>I've gOt tO run</i>

428
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:53,193
<i>To keep from hiding</i>

429
00:44:53,277 --> 00:44:55,612
<i>And I'm bound</i>

430
00:44:55,696 --> 00:44:58,198
<i>To keep on riding</i>

431
00:44:58,282 --> 00:45:02,911
<i>And I've got one more silver dollar</i>

432
00:45:02,995 --> 00:45:05,122
How much did you put on there?

433
00:45:14,006 --> 00:45:17,801
You put too much.
That's 250 pounds.

434
00:45:17,885 --> 00:45:21,680
How much can you lift?

435
00:45:21,763 --> 00:45:23,807
That's the most I ever lifted.

436
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:29,104
That could've been dangerous,Joseph.

437
00:45:29,188 --> 00:45:31,565
Why don't you go upstairs now
and let me finish up, okay?

438
00:45:31,648 --> 00:45:34,443
I'll take it off.
I'll help you right.

439
00:45:38,906 --> 00:45:42,576
You think you could have
beaten up Bruce Lee?

440
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:44,495
No.

441
00:45:44,578 --> 00:45:47,080
I mean, if you knew karate.

442
00:45:47,164 --> 00:45:49,166
No.

443
00:45:53,212 --> 00:45:56,340
Well, what if he wasn't allowed to kick,
and you were really mad at him?

444
00:45:56,423 --> 00:45:58,425
No,Joseph.

445
00:46:39,758 --> 00:46:42,469
How much did you take off?

446
00:46:44,346 --> 00:46:46,890
I lied.

447
00:46:49,434 --> 00:46:51,436
You added?

448
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:01,321
How much is it?

449
00:47:02,781 --> 00:47:04,783
270 pounds.

450
00:47:08,328 --> 00:47:10,330
Let's put more.

451
00:47:13,584 --> 00:47:15,043
Okay.

452
00:47:19,214 --> 00:47:21,967
Why don't you move back a little
just to be safe, okay?

453
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:56,752
More?

454
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:11,850
You should never do anything like this.
You know that, right?

455
00:48:13,644 --> 00:48:16,146
What do you do
if something bad happens?

456
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:18,732
Get Mom.

457
00:48:18,816 --> 00:48:20,692
Right.

458
00:48:55,894 --> 00:48:58,689
How much did you put on that time?

459
00:49:02,609 --> 00:49:04,486
All of it.

460
00:49:06,238 --> 00:49:08,240
What else can we use?

461
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:36,852
How much is it?

462
00:49:45,777 --> 00:49:47,779
How much is it, Dad?

463
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:53,285
About 350 pounds.

464
00:50:00,501 --> 00:50:02,461
Fracture of the fifth metacarpal
of the right hand...

465
00:50:02,544 --> 00:50:05,923
as well as multiple fractures of
the sixth, seventh and eighth ribs.

466
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:08,550
The worst of the injury, however,
was sustained to the right leg...

467
00:50:08,634 --> 00:50:10,636
in the form of a spiral fracture.

468
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:12,721
There were 14 breaks.

469
00:50:12,804 --> 00:50:15,682
It simply shattered.

470
00:50:15,766 --> 00:50:18,352
They call me Mr Glass.

471
00:50:18,435 --> 00:50:22,147
- Who does?
- Kids.

472
00:50:22,231 --> 00:50:24,316
Are you all right, Mr Price?

473
00:50:24,399 --> 00:50:26,401
Shall I continue?

474
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:30,113
Pins were placed throughout
the length of the leg.

475
00:50:30,197 --> 00:50:32,950
The use of a wheelchair will be needed
for a two-month period.

476
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:36,453
The use of crutches will follow
for 12 to 14 months.

477
00:50:36,537 --> 00:50:38,705
Hospital stay will range
from five to eight days...

478
00:50:38,789 --> 00:50:41,625
followed by nine to twelve months
of physical therapy.

479
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:44,419
Prescribed medication for pain
management will take the usual forms...

480
00:50:44,503 --> 00:50:47,297
of morphine drip, percocet, darvocet.

481
00:50:58,809 --> 00:51:00,894
Your, uh, 10:00 is here.

482
00:51:00,978 --> 00:51:03,105
The hospital discharged him
this morning.

483
00:51:05,315 --> 00:51:07,317
Thanks.

484
00:51:15,742 --> 00:51:17,202
Elijah, right?

485
00:51:17,286 --> 00:51:21,123
We're gonna prevent any substantial
atrophy of your good leg with this...

486
00:51:21,206 --> 00:51:23,458
and it works your quadriceps.

487
00:51:24,585 --> 00:51:26,795
How long have you been married?

488
00:51:29,506 --> 00:51:32,467
- Twelve years.
- How'd you get together?

489
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,722
I'm a little nervous being here.

490
00:51:36,805 --> 00:51:40,267
I ask too many questions
when I'm nervous.

491
00:51:42,352 --> 00:51:44,354
A car accident.

492
00:51:44,438 --> 00:51:48,192
Oh. And now you're gonna
have to tell me more.

493
00:51:52,571 --> 00:51:55,073
My husband was a star athlete
in college...

494
00:51:55,157 --> 00:51:57,201
and we were in
an accident together.

495
00:51:58,827 --> 00:52:02,873
Our car flipped on an icy road and we were both
injured, and he couldn't play football any more.

496
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:05,751
And if that hadn't happened,
we probably wouldn't have been together.

497
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:09,546
- How so?
- I think we should talk about your rehab.

498
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,965
You don't have to answer
if you don't want to.

499
00:52:13,091 --> 00:52:16,595
So, tell me more
about the quad machine.

500
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:20,849
It prevents atrophy by-

501
00:52:22,601 --> 00:52:24,812
I couldn't spend my life
with someone who played football.

502
00:52:24,895 --> 00:52:26,897
It's pretty much that simple.

503
00:52:28,065 --> 00:52:31,276
I mean, I don't hate the game. I admire
the amount of skill it involves.

504
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,154
And-And like everyone else,
I was in awe of the way he played it.

505
00:52:34,238 --> 00:52:38,492
But football, in many ways,
is the opposite of what I do.

506
00:52:39,743 --> 00:52:42,246
You're rewarded the more
you punish your opponent.

507
00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:45,791
You know, it's too much about violence,
and I don't want violence in my life.

508
00:52:47,084 --> 00:52:50,754
It's not a thing many people
can understand, but-

509
00:52:50,838 --> 00:52:53,924
Anyway, fate stepped in
with that car accident...

510
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:56,260
and took football out of the equation.

511
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:59,263
And everyone lived happily ever after.

512
00:53:01,306 --> 00:53:02,933
Sort of.

513
00:53:03,016 --> 00:53:05,686
What part of David's body was injured?

514
00:53:07,563 --> 00:53:10,399
Who said my husband's name was David?

515
00:53:18,157 --> 00:53:20,159
<i>Ladies and gentlemen-</i>

516
00:53:31,879 --> 00:53:33,881
<i>In the first half-</i>

517
00:54:03,035 --> 00:54:05,579
A 737 crashes on takeoff-

518
00:54:05,662 --> 00:54:08,624
172 die, no survivors.

519
00:54:08,707 --> 00:54:13,086
A hotel fire downtown-
211 die, no survivors.

520
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:17,132
An Eastrail train derails
71/2 miles outside the city-

521
00:54:17,216 --> 00:54:19,218
131 die...

522
00:54:19,301 --> 00:54:21,386
one survivor.

523
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:23,764
He is unharmed.

524
00:54:23,847 --> 00:54:26,767
I've spoken with your husband
about his survival.

525
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:29,686
I suggested a rather
unbelievable possibility.

526
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:32,940
Since then, I've come to believe
that possibility...

527
00:54:33,023 --> 00:54:35,025
however unbelievable...

528
00:54:35,108 --> 00:54:37,569
is now more a probability.

529
00:54:37,653 --> 00:54:40,531
And what was it you suggested?

530
00:54:40,614 --> 00:54:43,325
These are mediocre times, Mrs Dunn.

531
00:54:43,408 --> 00:54:46,995
People are starting to lose hope.
It's hard for many to believe...

532
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:51,124
there are extraordinary things
inside themselves as well as others.

533
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:54,336
I hope you can keep an open mind.

534
00:55:36,336 --> 00:55:38,922
Excuse me, sir?

535
00:55:39,006 --> 00:55:41,425
Can you step out of line, please?

536
00:55:45,554 --> 00:55:49,516
We've been having some problems with
people selling drugs here in the stadium.

537
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,060
Would you mind if I check your pockets?

538
00:55:53,187 --> 00:55:55,898
Raise your arms, please.

539
00:55:55,981 --> 00:55:57,983
Come on, raise them up.

540
00:55:58,066 --> 00:56:00,277
I just got here, man.

541
00:56:10,871 --> 00:56:12,915
Can I put my hands down now?

542
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:20,672
Can I go?

543
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:23,800
Yeah.

544
00:56:25,344 --> 00:56:27,346
Hope you find them.

545
00:56:36,605 --> 00:56:40,901
<i>- YO, Dunn.
- Yeah.</i>

546
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:44,029
<i>I just came into the office.
Your kid was hurt.</i>

547
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,492
<i>- Where is he?
- Some play rehearsal at school.</i>

548
00:56:48,575 --> 00:56:50,828
<i>He wants you to come down there.</i>

549
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,803
Is that your dad?

550
00:57:11,014 --> 00:57:14,184
I bet my dad could beat up your dad.

551
00:57:17,646 --> 00:57:20,816
No, he, uh, he insisted
we call only you...

552
00:57:20,899 --> 00:57:22,985
though we had some trouble
tracking you down.

553
00:57:23,068 --> 00:57:25,112
I mean, you're not on our list.

554
00:57:26,405 --> 00:57:27,990
Audrey handles this type of stuff.

555
00:57:28,073 --> 00:57:30,784
Oh. What type of stuff?

556
00:57:32,244 --> 00:57:34,246
Joseph stuff.

557
00:57:37,332 --> 00:57:39,751
Do I need to put any smelly ointment
on him or anything?

558
00:57:39,835 --> 00:57:41,837
No, no, it's more emotional damage.

559
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,465
Not, uh- Not to serious, physically.

560
00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:49,052
Nothing like when I sent you
to the hospital.

561
00:57:53,015 --> 00:57:55,225
When was that?

562
00:57:55,309 --> 00:57:59,938
My office was on the other side
of the building back then.

563
00:58:02,399 --> 00:58:05,068
You don't remember me, do you?

564
00:58:07,112 --> 00:58:11,158
- No, ma'am.
- I had red hair.

565
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:18,165
Well, you were a little younger
than Joseph when it happened.

566
00:58:18,248 --> 00:58:21,835
Did you know that we
changed the rules of conduct...

567
00:58:21,919 --> 00:58:24,713
around the pool because of you?

568
00:58:27,132 --> 00:58:29,134
The kids still tell about it...

569
00:58:29,218 --> 00:58:32,679
like it was some sort of ghost story.

570
00:58:32,763 --> 00:58:37,059
"Did you know there was a kid
nearly drowned in that pool?

571
00:58:38,352 --> 00:58:41,730
He lay on the bottom of the pool
for five minutes.

572
00:58:41,814 --> 00:58:46,026
And when they pulled him out,
he was dead. "

573
00:58:50,656 --> 00:58:54,701
We let them tell it.
It helps keep them safe.

574
00:58:58,288 --> 00:59:00,833
You still phobic of water?

575
00:59:03,836 --> 00:59:05,879
It was Potter and another guy.

576
00:59:07,214 --> 00:59:11,176
They were messing with
this Chinese girl in the dressing room.

577
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:14,596
Y- You can't let bad things
happen to good people, right?

578
00:59:15,722 --> 00:59:19,226
That's your code, right?
That's the hero's code.

579
00:59:20,727 --> 00:59:22,729
I tried to make them stop...

580
00:59:22,813 --> 00:59:26,900
but they kept pushing me down,
and they wouldn't let me get back up.

581
00:59:29,695 --> 00:59:32,531
I thought maybe 'cause you're my dad...

582
00:59:33,657 --> 00:59:35,993
I thought I might be like you.

583
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,582
I'm not like you.

584
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:46,670
You are like me.

585
00:59:46,753 --> 00:59:48,964
We can both get hurt.

586
00:59:50,299 --> 00:59:54,511
- I'm just an ordinary man.
- No, you're not.

587
00:59:54,595 --> 00:59:57,431
Why do you keep saying that?

588
01:00:05,147 --> 01:00:08,442
Elijah Price came to visit me
at the centre today.

589
01:00:09,568 --> 01:00:12,446
Jesus.

590
01:00:12,529 --> 01:00:15,282
He didn't do anything. He just...

591
01:00:15,365 --> 01:00:17,367
told me his theory.

592
01:00:18,494 --> 01:00:21,163
That's sad when patients get like that.

593
01:00:21,246 --> 01:00:23,248
They lose reality.

594
01:00:28,212 --> 01:00:30,756
Joseph, what the hell are you doing?

595
01:00:30,839 --> 01:00:32,841
Oh, my God.

596
01:00:32,925 --> 01:00:36,720
You don't believe. I'll show you.
You can't get hurt.

597
01:00:36,803 --> 01:00:39,723
That gun's not loaded. He doesn't
know where I keep the bullets.

598
01:00:39,806 --> 01:00:42,851
In your Rookie of the Year trophy.

599
01:00:42,935 --> 01:00:45,729
Joseph, did you load the gun?

600
01:00:45,813 --> 01:00:49,483
- You won't get hurt.
- Elijah was wrong.

601
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:52,069
- When did he meet Elijah?
- He was with me when I met him.

602
01:00:52,152 --> 01:00:54,154
No one believes him.

603
01:00:54,238 --> 01:00:57,199
Joseph, listen to me.

604
01:00:57,282 --> 01:01:02,412
Sometimes when people get sick or hurt
for a long time, like Elijah...

605
01:01:02,496 --> 01:01:06,375
their mind gets hurt too, and they
start to think things that aren't true.

606
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:10,254
He told me what he thought
about your father. It isn't true.

607
01:01:10,337 --> 01:01:12,339
I'll show you.

608
01:01:14,967 --> 01:01:19,012
Do you remember the story about the
- about the boy that almost drowned in the pool?

609
01:01:19,096 --> 01:01:21,765
That was me they were talking about.
I almost died. That was me.

610
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:24,643
- You're lying.
- I'm not lying, okay? I just didn't remember it, that's all.

611
01:01:24,726 --> 01:01:26,895
Joseph, you know your father
was injured in college.

612
01:01:26,979 --> 01:01:29,815
You know that.
You know all about that.

613
01:01:30,941 --> 01:01:33,485
Don't do it.
He'll die,Joseph.

614
01:01:33,569 --> 01:01:38,073
- I'll just shoot him once.
- Joseph, listen to what your moth-

615
01:01:38,157 --> 01:01:40,159
Don't be scared.

616
01:01:41,368 --> 01:01:43,370
Joseph...

617
01:01:43,453 --> 01:01:45,998
if you pull that trigger,
I'm going to leave.

618
01:01:46,081 --> 01:01:49,459
Do you understand?
I'm going to go to New York.

619
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:53,046
Y- Y-You're right.
If you pull that trigger...

620
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:56,383
that bullet is just gonna bounce off me,
and I'm not going to be hurt.

621
01:01:56,466 --> 01:01:58,802
But then I'm going to go upstairs
and I'm gonna pack...

622
01:01:58,886 --> 01:02:02,097
and I'm going to leave for New York.

623
01:02:02,181 --> 01:02:07,102
- Why?
- Because I thought we were just starting to be friends for real.

624
01:02:07,186 --> 01:02:09,188
And friends'll listen to each other.
They don't-

625
01:02:09,271 --> 01:02:13,108
And-And they don't shoot each other,
uh, uh, do they, Audrey?

626
01:02:13,192 --> 01:02:16,236
N- No shooting friends,Joseph.

627
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,780
Joseph!

628
01:02:18,864 --> 01:02:21,992
You are about to be in big trouble!

629
01:02:23,118 --> 01:02:25,120
Now, I am your father,
and I am telling you...

630
01:02:25,204 --> 01:02:28,415
to put that goddamn gun down
right now!

631
01:02:28,499 --> 01:02:31,335
One, two-

632
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:52,689
I followed the guy
in the camouflage jacket.

633
01:02:54,608 --> 01:03:00,030
He had a silver gun with a black grip
tucked in the back of his pants.

634
01:03:01,824 --> 01:03:05,077
Were you really injured
in that car accident in college?

635
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:08,664
'Cause I believe you faked it.
I believe you took the opportunity...

636
01:03:08,747 --> 01:03:11,500
to end your football career,
no questions asked.

637
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:15,337
And I think you did it,
of all things, for a woman.

638
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:17,422
I guess that makes sense.

639
01:03:17,506 --> 01:03:20,759
Football's what, just ten years?

640
01:03:20,843 --> 01:03:25,430
But love?
Hmm. Now, that's forever.

641
01:03:27,766 --> 01:03:30,978
And that little bit of sadness
in the mornings you spoke of?

642
01:03:31,061 --> 01:03:33,313
I think I know what that is.

643
01:03:33,397 --> 01:03:36,900
Perhaps you're not doing
what you're supposed to be doing.

644
01:03:36,984 --> 01:03:38,986
Most guns have a black
or silver handle.

645
01:03:39,069 --> 01:03:41,071
I had a 50-50 shot
of getting the colour right.

646
01:03:41,155 --> 01:03:44,283
- That's not what I witnessed.
- Stop.

647
01:03:44,366 --> 01:03:47,661
Stop messing with my life, Elijah.

648
01:03:47,744 --> 01:03:51,331
My son almost shot me last night because
he wanted to prove you were right.

649
01:03:51,415 --> 01:03:53,417
I never said you couldn't be killed.

650
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,502
- I never said that.
- My wife was right.

651
01:03:55,586 --> 01:04:00,424
There have been three major disasters,
and you were the only one unharmed.

652
01:04:00,507 --> 01:04:02,509
I have been sick.

653
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:09,433
When I was a kid, I spent a week in the
hospital getting better from pneumonia.

654
01:04:09,516 --> 01:04:13,270
I almost drowned.
Two skinny little kids...

655
01:04:13,353 --> 01:04:16,857
were fooling around in a pool dunking me
and I swallowed some water.

656
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:20,068
They didn't know it,
and it almost killed me.

657
01:04:20,152 --> 01:04:22,738
Heroes don't get killed like that.

658
01:04:22,821 --> 01:04:25,073
Normal people do, right?

659
01:04:26,658 --> 01:04:29,578
I don't need to see you any more, okay?

660
01:04:31,163 --> 01:04:33,665
Please stay away from my family.

661
01:04:42,341 --> 01:04:45,469
<i>She said I could tell stories
that could make you cry</i>

662
01:04:45,552 --> 01:04:47,596
<i>What about you</i>

663
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:49,890
Hey, man, it's 20 after.
It's time to choose.

664
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:51,975
I gotta head.

665
01:04:52,059 --> 01:04:56,271
<i>And she sighed, ahh
I said, I want to be a singer</i>

666
01:04:56,355 --> 01:04:59,775
You better not be jacking off to the
Japanese comics, I swear to God.

667
01:05:01,652 --> 01:05:04,780
<i>Let's go, let's sit
Let's talk politics</i>

668
01:05:04,863 --> 01:05:07,783
<i>Goes so good with beer
And while we're at it, baby</i>

669
01:05:07,866 --> 01:05:10,369
<i>Why don't you tell me
one of your biggest fears</i>

670
01:05:10,452 --> 01:05:13,580
<i>I said, losing my penis
to a whore with disease</i>

671
01:05:13,664 --> 01:05:15,791
Uh, look, man, I didn't
know you were in a-

672
01:05:15,874 --> 01:05:18,085
<i>Losin'my life to
a whore with disease</i>

673
01:05:18,168 --> 01:05:21,129
<i>- Just choose something, all right?
- Excuse me, please</i>

674
01:05:26,051 --> 01:05:28,053
The baby-sitter's here.

675
01:05:30,973 --> 01:05:34,143
- Should we cancel?
- I'm fine.

676
01:05:37,146 --> 01:05:39,940
We can do this another time.

677
01:05:40,023 --> 01:05:42,025
Don't lie.

678
01:05:44,069 --> 01:05:46,738
I'm fine. I just got mixed up.

679
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:56,748
How about we just go
for a couple drinks?

680
01:06:02,421 --> 01:06:05,174
Okay, look, man,
I'm-I'm just gonna wheel you out.

681
01:06:05,257 --> 01:06:07,259
All right? You can think about things
outside on the sidewalk.

682
01:06:07,342 --> 01:06:09,344
I gotta get some chicken in me,
you know what I'm sayin'?

683
01:06:09,428 --> 01:06:12,598
<i>I've been tired, I've been tired</i>

684
01:06:12,681 --> 01:06:17,603
<i>I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired</i>

685
01:06:26,445 --> 01:06:29,740
<i>- I told the tale of a girl
- Shit!</i>

686
01:06:29,823 --> 01:06:32,075
<i>She's a little bit older than me</i>

687
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:34,912
<i>Strong legs, strong face
voice like milk</i>

688
01:06:34,995 --> 01:06:36,997
<i>Breasts like a cluster of grapes</i>

689
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,374
<i>I can't escape her ways</i>

690
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:41,460
<i>She raise me</i>

691
01:06:45,756 --> 01:06:49,760
<i>- Dude.
- Even if you have no one</i>

692
01:06:49,843 --> 01:06:51,887
Man, I don't care if you are in
a wheelchair. If you do that again...

693
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:54,515
I'm calling 5-0.

694
01:06:54,598 --> 01:06:56,683
<i>And while you're at it, baby</i>

695
01:06:56,767 --> 01:06:58,769
Man.

696
01:07:04,316 --> 01:07:08,946
<i>You don't want to sleep
after setting my loins on fire</i>

697
01:07:09,029 --> 01:07:12,407
That's it, crackerjack. You're gonna
be sitting your ass in jail now.

698
01:07:12,491 --> 01:07:17,204
<i>I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired</i>

699
01:07:17,287 --> 01:07:20,833
<i>I've been tired, I've been tired</i>

700
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:33,720
<i>I've been tired, I've been tired</i>

701
01:07:33,804 --> 01:07:36,974
<i>- I've been tired, I've been tired
- How much for this one?</i>

702
01:07:37,057 --> 01:07:38,559
<i>I've been tired</i>

703
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:43,397
- Rust?
- Yeah.

704
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:45,816
As a colour, not as rust.

705
01:07:45,899 --> 01:07:49,820
You know, like rust-coloured
paint or wood.

706
01:07:51,613 --> 01:07:54,908
- I didn't know that.
- Mm-hmm.

707
01:07:54,992 --> 01:07:57,578
Mine's still brown.

708
01:07:57,661 --> 01:07:59,663
Okay, my turn.

709
01:07:59,746 --> 01:08:01,957
Favourite song?

710
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:06,211
"Soft and Wet" by the Artist
Formerly Known as Prince.

711
01:08:06,295 --> 01:08:08,630
What?

712
01:08:08,714 --> 01:08:11,466
We're supposed to be honest.

713
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:13,969
"Soft And Wet. "

714
01:08:14,052 --> 01:08:16,388
That's very interesting.

715
01:08:16,472 --> 01:08:18,474
Okay, my turn.

716
01:08:20,184 --> 01:08:22,394
When was the first time...

717
01:08:23,729 --> 01:08:26,773
the thought popped into your head
we might not make it?

718
01:08:28,275 --> 01:08:30,277
That's not the game.

719
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:33,405
It's the first date.
There aren't any rules.

720
01:08:37,576 --> 01:08:41,121
- Don't know for sure.
- Think carefully.

721
01:08:42,414 --> 01:08:44,416
What about the game?

722
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,502
It's over. I won.

723
01:08:48,504 --> 01:08:50,506
Look, maybe it wasn't
a specific moment.

724
01:08:50,589 --> 01:08:55,344
- Maybe it was a time-
- I had a nightmare one night...

725
01:08:55,427 --> 01:09:01,266
and I didn't wake you up so you
could tell me that it was okay.

726
01:09:02,768 --> 01:09:05,145
I think that was the first time.

727
01:09:07,189 --> 01:09:09,191
Does that count?

728
01:09:10,734 --> 01:09:12,736
That counts.

729
01:09:16,448 --> 01:09:20,327
Do you knowingly keep me
and Joseph at a distance?

730
01:09:28,043 --> 01:09:30,462
Yes.

731
01:09:30,546 --> 01:09:32,548
Why?

732
01:09:34,716 --> 01:09:36,718
I don't know.

733
01:09:41,223 --> 01:09:43,809
I just don't feel right, Audrey.

734
01:09:45,227 --> 01:09:47,604
Something's...

735
01:09:47,688 --> 01:09:49,898
just not right.

736
01:09:52,025 --> 01:09:55,195
Do you resent us, David?

737
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:57,781
Resent the life you have?

738
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:03,328
I mean, there were a lot of other things
you could've done after college.

739
01:10:03,412 --> 01:10:05,789
These were your choices.

740
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,754
You know, even if it meant
we couldn't have been together...

741
01:10:12,838 --> 01:10:16,300
I never would've wished
that injury on you.

742
01:10:16,383 --> 01:10:18,844
What you could do physically...

743
01:10:18,927 --> 01:10:21,180
was a gift.

744
01:10:21,263 --> 01:10:24,057
I never would've wished it to go away.

745
01:10:26,268 --> 01:10:28,270
You know that, right?

746
01:10:32,483 --> 01:10:35,319
You had two calls after Joseph
went to bed. One came through...

747
01:10:35,402 --> 01:10:37,696
while I was on the other line,
but I wasn't talking too long.

748
01:10:37,779 --> 01:10:41,617
There was an emergency with my sister. She tried to do
her own perm, and now she looks like she stuck her head-

749
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:43,827
Who called through?

750
01:10:43,911 --> 01:10:46,330
Um, someone from New York...

751
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:48,457
uh, about a security job.

752
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:51,752
They want to hire you. I didn't know
you guys were moving to New York.

753
01:10:51,835 --> 01:10:54,254
Thanks for telling me.

754
01:10:54,338 --> 01:10:56,924
We weren't all gonna move.

755
01:10:58,091 --> 01:11:00,093
Oh.

756
01:11:02,012 --> 01:11:05,349
I let the answering machine
pick up the other call.

757
01:11:09,478 --> 01:11:11,480
Great.

758
01:11:22,991 --> 01:11:26,787
Look, let's just be honest here.
We're just at the beginning...

759
01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:29,873
and I don't expect
you or I to change...

760
01:11:29,957 --> 01:11:32,417
the course of where
our lives were headed...

761
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:34,795
because of one date.

762
01:11:34,878 --> 01:11:39,341
And if you do go to New York,
we can develop this.

763
01:11:39,424 --> 01:11:42,594
We'll just be forced to take it slow.

764
01:11:42,678 --> 01:11:46,431
And in the end, I think
that's definitely better.

765
01:11:48,976 --> 01:11:51,270
I mean, this is our second time around,
David. I didn't expect us...

766
01:11:51,353 --> 01:11:53,647
to get carried away.

767
01:11:55,899 --> 01:11:59,778
But I guess "congratulations"
is the right thing to say.

768
01:12:24,553 --> 01:12:26,805
<i>David, it's Elijah.</i>

769
01:12:26,889 --> 01:12:28,891
<i>It was so obvious.</i>

770
01:12:28,974 --> 01:12:31,310
<i>It was this one issue
that brought it back for me-</i>

771
01:12:31,393 --> 01:12:33,395
<i>Century Comics 117.</i>

772
01:12:33,479 --> 01:12:35,606
<i>That's where this group,
the Coalition of Evil...</i>

773
01:12:35,689 --> 01:12:38,192
<i>tried to ascertain the weakness
of every superhero...</i>

774
01:12:38,275 --> 01:12:41,695
<i>because they all have one,
just like you.</i>

775
01:12:41,778 --> 01:12:45,824
<i>Your bones don't break.
Mine do. That's clear.</i>

776
01:12:45,908 --> 01:12:49,369
<i>Your cells react to bacteria
and viruses differently than mine.</i>

777
01:12:49,453 --> 01:12:53,415
<i>You don't get sick.
I do. That's also clear.</i>

778
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:58,795
<i>But for some reason, you and I
react the exact same way to water.</i>

779
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:01,298
<i>We swallow it too fast, we choke.</i>

780
01:13:01,381 --> 01:13:03,634
<i>We get some in our lungs, we drown.</i>

781
01:13:03,717 --> 01:13:08,806
<i>However unreal it may seem,
we are connected, you and I.</i>

782
01:13:08,889 --> 01:13:13,560
<i>We're on the same curve,
just on opposite ends.</i>

783
01:13:13,644 --> 01:13:17,689
<i>The point of all this is we
now know something we didn't.</i>

784
01:13:17,773 --> 01:13:21,318
<i>You have a weakness- water.</i>

785
01:13:21,401 --> 01:13:24,363
<i>It's like your kryptonite.</i>

786
01:13:24,446 --> 01:13:26,740
<i>You hearing me, David?</i>

787
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:43,710
Audrey?

788
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:19,538
Gotcha. Come on.

789
01:16:37,139 --> 01:16:39,975
Audrey. Audrey.

790
01:16:45,856 --> 01:16:47,858
Hey!

791
01:16:51,945 --> 01:16:54,823
You'll be okay.

792
01:16:54,907 --> 01:16:58,702
What- What happened?

793
01:16:58,785 --> 01:17:02,706
I thought I was-
I thought I was dead.

794
01:17:02,789 --> 01:17:04,791
Me too.

795
01:17:09,254 --> 01:17:11,256
Is she all right?

796
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:13,675
I think her leg's broken.

797
01:17:13,759 --> 01:17:16,303
Are you hurt?

798
01:17:16,386 --> 01:17:18,597
Hey, man, are you hurt?

799
01:17:49,044 --> 01:17:51,046
Hello.

800
01:17:51,129 --> 01:17:53,882
<i>I wasn't injured in that car accident.</i>

801
01:17:53,966 --> 01:17:56,593
David.

802
01:17:56,677 --> 01:17:59,221
<i>I've never been injured, Elijah.</i>

803
01:18:01,557 --> 01:18:03,851
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

804
01:18:09,815 --> 01:18:12,693
Go to where people are.

805
01:18:12,776 --> 01:18:15,779
You won't have to look very long.

806
01:18:17,406 --> 01:18:20,367
It's all right to be afraid, David...

807
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:24,496
because this part won't be
like a comic book.

808
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:29,459
Real life doesn't fit into little boxes
that were drawn for it.

809
01:19:07,789 --> 01:19:11,752
There's one in the first row.
It's- It's the second one.

810
01:19:11,835 --> 01:19:14,713
Yes. It's the second one over.

811
01:19:47,871 --> 01:19:50,040
Go back to Africa!

812
01:20:06,348 --> 01:20:08,600
Hey, what's your name?

813
01:20:14,231 --> 01:20:16,441
I think you drank too much.

814
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:04,114
Can I come in?

815
01:21:04,198 --> 01:21:06,742
Who are you?

816
01:21:06,825 --> 01:21:09,620
I like your house.

817
01:21:09,703 --> 01:21:11,705
Can I come in?

818
01:21:11,788 --> 01:21:13,999
What is this?

819
01:21:15,667 --> 01:21:18,962
No, you can't come in.

820
01:21:19,046 --> 01:21:21,507
Are you sure?

821
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:23,884
What are- What are you-

822
01:25:54,071 --> 01:25:56,073
It's okay.

823
01:26:06,416 --> 01:26:08,418
It's okay. It's okay.

824
01:32:52,114 --> 01:32:54,700
I had a bad dream.

825
01:33:00,581 --> 01:33:02,749
It's over now.

826
01:33:30,736 --> 01:33:33,572
I don't know.

827
01:33:33,655 --> 01:33:35,741
I can't believe you'd think that.

828
01:33:35,824 --> 01:33:37,826
I'm just asking you.

829
01:33:41,079 --> 01:33:43,290
I'm making French toast.

830
01:33:58,722 --> 01:34:01,308
I've been thinking about Elijah Price.

831
01:34:02,601 --> 01:34:06,396
If he shows up again, I think
we should call the police, okay?

832
01:34:10,484 --> 01:34:12,486
Okay?

833
01:34:14,988 --> 01:34:16,990
Okay.

834
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:27,186
You were right.

835
01:36:16,777 --> 01:36:20,864
This is one of Johann Davis'
earliest drawings.

836
01:36:20,948 --> 01:36:23,325
See the villain's eyes?

837
01:36:23,408 --> 01:36:25,661
They're larger than
the other characters'.

838
01:36:25,744 --> 01:36:31,250
They insinuate a slightly skewed
perspective on how they see the world-

839
01:36:32,376 --> 01:36:34,670
just off normal.

840
01:36:34,753 --> 01:36:37,089
He doesn't look scary.

841
01:36:37,172 --> 01:36:39,675
Mm-hmm. That's what I said to my son.

842
01:36:39,758 --> 01:36:42,427
But he says there's always two kinds.

843
01:36:42,511 --> 01:36:46,932
There's the soldier villain
who fights the hero with his hands...

844
01:36:47,015 --> 01:36:51,311
and then there's the real threat-
the brilliant and evil archenemy...

845
01:36:51,395 --> 01:36:53,897
who fights the hero with his mind.

846
01:36:53,981 --> 01:36:55,983
Are you Elijah's mother?

847
01:36:56,066 --> 01:36:59,820
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.

848
01:36:59,903 --> 01:37:02,698
Nice to meet you. I'm David Dunn.

849
01:37:02,781 --> 01:37:04,783
He's spoken of you.

850
01:37:04,867 --> 01:37:06,869
Says you're becoming friends.

851
01:37:06,952 --> 01:37:09,371
We are.

852
01:37:09,454 --> 01:37:11,665
Looks like he's doing good today.

853
01:37:12,791 --> 01:37:15,711
I'm very proud of him.

854
01:37:15,794 --> 01:37:18,881
He's come through a lot in his life-

855
01:37:18,964 --> 01:37:22,509
a couple of bad spills
I thought had broken him.

856
01:37:22,593 --> 01:37:25,721
Mm-hmm. They were bad...

857
01:37:26,847 --> 01:37:29,391
but he made it.

858
01:37:29,475 --> 01:37:31,477
Yes, he did.

859
01:37:32,603 --> 01:37:34,813
He's kind of a miracle.

860
01:37:36,982 --> 01:37:38,984
Yes, he is.

861
01:37:42,529 --> 01:37:45,199
- I'll tell him you're here.
- Thank you.

862
01:37:46,533 --> 01:37:50,287
We'll work something out.
Always able to work something out.

863
01:38:15,354 --> 01:38:17,356
It has begun.

864
01:38:20,484 --> 01:38:22,611
Tell me something, David.

865
01:38:23,737 --> 01:38:28,283
When you woke up this morning,
was it still there?

866
01:38:28,367 --> 01:38:31,245
The sadness?

867
01:38:31,328 --> 01:38:33,330
No.

868
01:38:36,917 --> 01:38:39,962
I think this is where we shake hands.

869
01:38:58,981 --> 01:39:02,025
- Look!
- Did you see it?

870
01:39:11,410 --> 01:39:13,912
I worked in that building 25 years.

871
01:39:13,996 --> 01:39:16,123
I know all its secrets.

872
01:39:17,583 --> 01:39:19,585
Secrets?

873
01:39:21,003 --> 01:39:25,924
Like if there ever was a fire
on floors one, two or three...

874
01:39:26,008 --> 01:39:29,511
everyone in that hotel
would be burned alive.

875
01:39:35,476 --> 01:39:38,228
Passengers aren't allowed in there.

876
01:40:21,522 --> 01:40:23,982
Do you know what
the scariest thing is?

877
01:40:27,694 --> 01:40:30,989
To not know your place
in this world...

878
01:40:31,073 --> 01:40:33,617
to not know why you're here.

879
01:40:34,910 --> 01:40:36,912
That's-

880
01:40:38,747 --> 01:40:41,166
That's just an awful feeling.

881
01:40:42,543 --> 01:40:44,878
What have you done?

882
01:40:46,046 --> 01:40:49,091
I almost gave up hope.

883
01:40:49,174 --> 01:40:52,386
There were so many times
I questioned myself.

884
01:40:52,469 --> 01:40:55,013
You killed all those people.

885
01:40:56,306 --> 01:40:59,143
But I found you.

886
01:40:59,226 --> 01:41:02,521
So many sacrifices...

887
01:41:03,647 --> 01:41:05,649
just to find you.

888
01:41:05,732 --> 01:41:07,734
Jesus Christ!

889
01:41:17,619 --> 01:41:20,414
Now that we know who you are...

890
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:24,251
I know who I am.

891
01:41:27,838 --> 01:41:30,048
I'm not a mistake.

892
01:41:31,550 --> 01:41:33,719
It all makes sense.

893
01:41:33,802 --> 01:41:38,390
In a comic, you know how you can tell
who the arch-villain's going to be?

894
01:41:38,474 --> 01:41:41,852
He's the exact opposite of the hero.

895
01:41:41,935 --> 01:41:45,689
And most times, they're friends,
like you and me.

896
01:41:45,772 --> 01:41:49,610
I should've known way back when.
You know why, David?

897
01:41:49,693 --> 01:41:51,695
Because of the kids.

898
01:42:01,622 --> 01:42:04,291
They called me Mr Glass.
