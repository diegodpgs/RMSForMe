00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:36,795
"Golden dreams
and great heartache,"

3
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:54,945
"churn in the depth of the soul
of this river... called life."

4
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:07,007
"When great mountains lay
in its path,"

5
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:13,915
"it cuts deep gorges through
the rock... to keep flowing!.."

6
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:26,386
"This unstoppable, inexhaustible
river called life..."

7
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:45,662
"It is called
the river of life."

8
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,541
Lord Shiva!

9
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,012
For all the sins
I have committed,

10
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,594
if death is the only redemption,
then take my life!...

11
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,520
But this boy should live...

12
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:54,684
He should live for his mother
who is waiting for him...

13
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,903
he should live to ascend
the throne Mahishmati...

14
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:01,653
Mahendra Baahubali should live!

15
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,731
Dear me!

16
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,240
Hey! What are you
waiting for? Hurry!

17
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,653
Hey! Be careful!

18
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,226
- What happened?
- I am not sure, master.

19
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,681
With all the jewelry on her,

20
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,149
she must have been
a queen or something.

21
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,439
She died with her
hand pointing up!

22
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,114
Master!

23
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,368
What happened?

24
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,158
They must have come
here to kill her.

25
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,748
Looks like she got
the better of them.

26
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,668
Master!

27
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,382
Oh my God! A cave!

28
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,752
We never knew this existed!

29
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,348
Looks like it goes all the way
to the top of the mountain!

30
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,636
If the lady was holding the
baby up, pointing to the top,

31
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,554
Maybe she wanted us
to take it back there!

32
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,021
You are out of your mind?

33
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,645
They sent soldiers
to kill an infant!

34
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,025
What dangers do
you think await him...

35
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,019
- if you send him back there!
- But, Sanga..

36
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,984
This is my baby.

37
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,986
I have no children...

38
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,867
and the river Goddess
has given this boy to me.

39
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:14,998
If anyone of you object,
I will trample upon your necks.

40
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,376
What are you waiting for?
Close the cave.

41
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,512
Shiva!

42
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,347
Shiva!

43
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,521
What are you doing here,
my dear?

44
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,311
What is up there, mother?

45
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,818
There are ghosts
and demons up there!

46
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,911
They prey on
and eat little kids!

47
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,779
But I want to go up there,
mother!

48
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,202
Don't ever say you want
to go up there! Let us go.

49
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,228
How many times have I told you
not to climb up there?

50
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,018
Why do you keep doing it?

51
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,733
You are my darling, right?
You won't do it again, right?

52
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,783
Looks like he will
make it this time.

53
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,157
No way!
Look at the water mountain!

54
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,658
It goes way up into the clouds...

55
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,875
And how many times has he fallen
from that hundred feet?

56
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:23,743
He always slips and falls
after the first hundred feet.

57
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,537
Yeah, he slipped and fell
at least a hundred times.

58
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,255
Watch!
He is going to come sliding down again.

59
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,539
Shiva!

60
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,209
Your mother is upto something there!

61
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:16,342
'Shiva, Shiva, Shiva, Shiva,
Shiva, Shiva, Shiva, Shiva!'

62
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,640
That is fifteen!

63
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:22,769
Pour another 101 times and
your prayers will be answered!

64
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:27,016
Sage, if I do this,
will my son listen to me?

65
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,230
Will he stop trying to climb
up that mountain?

66
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,111
Of course!
This is a powerful ritual!

67
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,111
Pour this water over Shiva,
with all your heart,

68
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,651
and He will guide your son
onto the right path.

69
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,870
- Alright! 0! Sage.
- Hail Shiva!

70
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,658
Mother, you are not
getting younger, are you?

71
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,539
It won't help you if you
run around so much!

72
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,004
- Out of my way!
- Mother, please listen to me!

73
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,541
Why should I?
Do you ever listen to me?

74
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,377
Father, can you please
tell her to stop?

75
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,386
- Sanga?
- What?

76
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,048
- Where are the flowers?
- Father! Father!

77
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,015
Let go of me!

78
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,635
Alright! Let me do it on your behalf.
Okay?

79
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,520
No way!
Lord Shiva won't accept it.

80
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,107
The one who took the oath
will have to pour the water!

81
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,653
- Sire, carry on with what you are doing.
- Hail Lord Shiva!

82
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,363
- Mother.
- What is it now?

83
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,783
How about I carry you...

84
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,902
and you can pour the water
over Lord Shiva? Fine?

85
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,246
No way!
Lord Shiva won't accept it.

86
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,740
The one who took the oath
will have to pour the water

87
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,875
and she has to walk up
to pour the water!

88
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:33,632
Sage, are you and your Shiva
planning to kill my mother?

89
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:37,002
How should I know what
the Lord has in store?

90
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:45,635
Lord Shiva!

91
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,683
Sanga!

92
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,898
See what your lad is up to now!

93
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,767
What is it this time?

94
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,909
Shiva, stop!

95
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:06,740
You will go to hell for this
blasphemy! Shiva, stop!

96
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,378
Shiva.

97
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,014
Shiva, wait".

98
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:38,905
"The celestial river agitatedly
moving through His matted hair"

99
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:44,118
"which makes His head shine
with those soft waves."

100
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:53,753
"And His forehead shining
like a brilliant fire"

101
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,997
"and the crescent of moon which
is an ornament to His head"

102
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:59,338
"makes my mind love Him
each and every moment."

103
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,601
"Who is he and
where he comes from?"

104
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:13,766
"He brought with him eternal
light spreading everywhere."

105
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:18,232
"His strong arms can turn
the tide of history."

106
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,031
"River Bhagirathi, Lord Shiva
head towards you."

107
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:26,995
"Look at this great irony."

108
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:59,895
"The consort of the sportive
daughter of the mountain"

109
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:06,322
"whose mind rejoices
at Her side long glances."

110
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:12,032
"With the stream of merciful
look which removes hardships"

111
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,375
"“Makes my mind
take pleasure in Him"

112
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:18,079
"who wears the directions
as apparel."

113
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,921
"With the lustrous gem"

114
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,294
"on the serpent's hood
in His matted locks."

115
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,637
"He, who is with His bride
whose face is decorated"

116
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:30,016
"by the melting of
red saffron vermillion."

117
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,556
"And who wears on His shoulder
the hide of the elephant"

118
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,059
"which was blind
with ferociousness."

119
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,402
"Makes my mind happy
and contented in Him"

120
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,864
"who is the leader of demons."

121
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,877
Mother!

122
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,387
Not just a thousand
showers for your Lord,

123
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,891
He will bathe all the time now.
Are you happy now?

124
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,268
Yes..

125
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,782
Sage, it played out
just like you predicted!

126
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:21,536
My son hasn't looked up
at that waterfall since.

127
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,540
Do you ever underestimate
Lord Shiva's power?

128
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,384
But now he sits staring
at the wooden mask

129
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:32,514
that fell on the Shivalingam
from above.

130
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,969
Now what is with that?

131
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:38,887
Lord Shiva works
in mysterious ways.

132
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,521
Only He would know.

133
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:41,681
A small doubt.

134
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,775
Since my son was
the one who made sure

135
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,313
the idol is bathed all the time.

136
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,021
Will his wish of climbing
up the mountain come true

137
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,522
or will Sanga's
wish of him always

138
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,815
staying down here come true?

139
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:54,536
To hell with your doubts.
My son did what he did for me!

140
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,781
My wish will be fulfilled.
Isn't that right?

141
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:03,037
Lord Shiva does whatever
He thinks. Hail Lord Shiva!

142
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,878
Hail Lord Shiva!

143
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:06,755
What did he say?

144
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,013
Shiva!

145
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,303
How long are you going
to sit holding that wooden mask?

146
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,643
There is somebody up there.

147
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,229
Maybe there is, but your mother
is calling out to you.

148
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,766
- Let us go home.
- Go ahead. I will come later.

149
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,232
Let us go, boys.

150
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,070
Who are you?
Why did you come to me?

151
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:48,228
"My heart is lost."

152
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:55,365
"Like a drop in the waves."

153
00:21:55,815 --> 00:22:01,242
"l am the one whose
eyes shine amidst the stars"

154
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,991
"l am the one who
sings amidst the waterfalls."

155
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:09,879
"My voice echoes through
streams, listen to me!"

156
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:16,344
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

157
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:22,509
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

158
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:28,773
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

159
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:35,780
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

160
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,770
"l breathe for you..."

161
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:11,891
"and only you."

162
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:18,774
"Come and let us live together."

163
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:24,328
"Let me tell you something,
my love."

164
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:31,753
"l chose you as my soul mate."

165
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:38,635
"Whether I stumble and fall,
with haste I will come."

166
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:43,006
"l am but a sudden gust of wind.
I stop for no one."

167
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:51,148
"l will break free of every
mountain in no time."

168
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:55,860
"He is strong and without an
equal adversary who can fight."

169
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:02,075
"His anger will cause
new fears in his foes."

170
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:08,243
"He is strong and without an
equal adversary who can fight."

171
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:14,879
"His anger will cause
new fears in his foes."

172
00:24:56,662 --> 00:25:01,662
"You come out of blue
with a gift of love."

173
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:14,647
"Drop a word and I swear"

174
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:20,857
"l will give up my life for you."

175
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:28,661
"Scaling peak impossible, his
blood flows like a rivulet."

176
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:34,831
"His sturdy body, a weapon.
Hail this hero of the world."

177
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:41,257
"Destructive in the air and sky
can win with his roar of war."

178
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:47,422
"A ferocious warrior will become
soft-hearted afterwards."

179
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,759
"Killer of fear.
Ocean of wealth."

180
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,894
"Arduous struggle over,
healing calm sets over him."

181
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:57,227
"Killer of fear.
Ocean of wealth."

182
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,021
"Arduous struggle over,
healing calm sets over him."

183
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:03,237
"Killer of fear.
Ocean of wealth."

184
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,944
"Arduous struggle over,
healing calm sets over him."

185
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:10,786
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

186
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:17,331
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

187
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:23,758
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

188
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:29,968
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

189
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,266
"The persevering one.."

190
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:37,229
"Hey, warrior. Come closer!"

191
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:45,530
"Hey, handsome. You are mine."

192
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,838
Hey!

193
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,388
Hey! Stop!

194
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,640
Stop!

195
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,992
Over there!

196
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,766
Kasi!

197
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,246
It is a trap. Kill them!

198
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,508
Dear God!

199
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,159
How come you got this?

200
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:44,408
One of your men,
sneaked into our kingdom.

201
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:48,129
He tried to rescue Devasena.
We killed him.

202
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,586
It was tied to his wrist.
I took it from him.

203
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,508
I don't know anything else.

204
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,885
Let me go! Let me..

205
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,602
Bury the dead
and leave no traces.

206
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:50,353
Dilip too has attained
martyrdom, chief!

207
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,873
Don't let the drop of tear
breach your eyelids.

208
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:12,003
That monster from the palace
has imprisoned our princess

209
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,713
and has her shackled
right in the town square.

210
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:26,727
Our Queen Devasena being
treated like cattle in a fair.

211
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:37,813
Our pride and honor is injured
and we suffer in silence.

212
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:41,067
It is not time to shed tears.

213
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,243
It is time to breathe fire.

214
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,373
Have you forgotten
your solemn oath?

215
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,285
We will remember it
till our last breath.

216
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,376
To meet our goal

217
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,750
we will clash with thunder"
- We won't lose courage.

218
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,132
Come hell or high water"
- We will be brave!

219
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,292
- Or death that splits us in pieces..
- We won't budge!

220
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,885
We shall rescue Devasena!

221
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,267
If we are to achieve our goal..

222
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,533
"Attachments become
our weakness..."

223
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,532
"and there is no place for
joy or celebrations."

224
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,868
"Our body is for our lost
Motherland, Kuntala Kingdom..."

225
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:31,124
"and soul exists
only to free Devasena."

226
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:40,588
My leader...

227
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,295
I heard many good things
about a warrior...

228
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,218
called Kattappa of Mahishmati.

229
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:49,301
I heard he is a good man.
Couldn't we ask him to help?

230
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,644
Karikala Kattappa Nadaar.

231
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,022
He is indeed a good man.

232
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,438
He can help us if he wants to.

233
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,988
But he won't...

234
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:06,653
Kattappa is a slave
the throne of Mahishmati.

235
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,877
Kattappa.

236
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:21,383
A sword trader, Sheik Aslam Khan
from Kabul is here to see you.

237
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:37,141
The ore is extracted from
the depths of Baghdad mines.

238
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,230
Purified in the furnaces
of the Golan mountains.

239
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,780
Crafted by the best
blacksmiths in Persia.

240
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,660
With this in hand...

241
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,662
even a child can slice
through ten banyan trees.

242
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,543
I call this the Sikander.

243
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,372
The Pride of Swords.

244
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:08,972
A wonderful sword.

245
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:13,136
But forgive me, Aslam,
this cannot match our speed.

246
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,228
How insulting!

247
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:24,772
Spoken words and spilled blood
can never be taken back.

248
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:30,365
Duel with my sword and
prove the worth of your words.

249
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,349
Does that prove
my point, Kattappa?

250
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,632
I have traveled across the world

251
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,468
China, Persia, Mongolia, Greece.

252
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,138
But never seen
a warrior like you.

253
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,975
It will be an honor
to break bread with you.

254
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,973
- Please come, Kattappa.
- Please forgive me, Aslam.

255
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:42,812
Slaves here do not
dine with royal guests.

256
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,899
Slave?

257
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:49,902
You are the head of the armory,
how can you be a slave?

258
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,651
Yes, Aslam. A slave
like you have never seen before.

259
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,740
He forges the weapons for war.

260
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:57,998
During war, he must protect
the king with his own life.

261
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,535
After the war,
he should still lay by his feet.

262
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:08,376
Tell me, what will it cost
to buy your freedom?

263
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,629
I will pay 10, even 100 times that
to buy your freedom.

264
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,349
You cannot put a price
on this slave, Aslam.

265
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:20,646
My ancestors pledged that
everyone born in our clan...

266
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:24,308
will serve the throne
of Mahishmati for life.

267
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:27,527
For a pledge that
a long forgotten ancestor made

268
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,521
you still..

269
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,656
People who made the pledge
might be dead

270
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:34,993
but their word
still lives on, Aslam.

271
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:39,748
For this life, these bonds
will stay tied to this land.

272
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,622
If loyalty has a face,
it is you, Kattappa.

273
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,881
If you ever need anything...

274
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,884
please don't ever forget that
you have a life-long friend.

275
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,243
- Vaishali.
- Hmm.

276
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,078
- Where are you going?
- I will be right back.

277
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:10,891
We have a golden opportunity

278
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,775
to fulfill the oath
we have taken.

279
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:16,233
They are celebrating
Bhallaladeva's birthday

280
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:18,197
on the next new moon.

281
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,239
The entire kingdom will be busy
with the celebrations.

282
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:25,781
The opportunity to
free Queen Devasena...

283
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,660
- Give me the opportunity, sir!
- Chief, let me go!

284
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,128
I offer it to Avanthika,
this time.

285
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,713
Avanthika!

286
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,147
What is this, Avanthika?

287
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:55,894
Where did this come from?

288
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,445
You focused on your beauty
more than your oath!

289
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:06,613
You cannot put your life at stake
since you love yourself so much.

290
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,749
You are not worthy
of this honor. Leave us.

291
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:24,139
These tears are not
a reflection of my cowardice

292
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:27,976
nor do they come from pain.

293
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:34,524
They are a testament
to my boiling blood.

294
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,362
If you can feel their intensity

295
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,066
then let me go.

296
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,835
You have to leave in two days.
So get ready.

297
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,630
Be careful and get
the job done, Avanthika.

298
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,008
If you get caught because
of your own neglect...

299
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:03,420
Bhallaladeva will torture you
mercilessly before he kills you.

300
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:40,876
"Our Mahishmati Kingdom
shall remain unconquerable."

301
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:50,973
"As long as the sun, moon
and stars are shining there."

302
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:09,866
"Felicity and glory
reigns supreme here."

303
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:16,786
"A flourished kingdom,
happy subjects"

304
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:21,381
"and the home of peace."

305
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:40,519
"May the glory of Mahishmathi
soar sky high."

306
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:44,396
"Our flag with the emblem
of the rising sun"

307
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:48,775
"our golden throne
flanked by to stallions."

308
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,058
Your Majesty,
it is just been two days since

309
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:19,897
we caught that bull
in the forests.

310
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:23,359
We haven't broken it yet.
It is quite dangerous...

311
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,978
Minister!

312
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:31,193
It would take 10 such bulls
to intimidate Bhallaladeva.

313
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,528
Please come.

314
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:36,883
Stamp it out, Bhalla!

315
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,429
Yes!

316
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:48,735
Kill him, father.

317
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,242
Did you see, grandfather?

318
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,456
His Majesty overpowered
the bull.

319
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,628
Glory to the king!

320
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,623
That was a great feat.

321
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:12,635
Bravo, Your Majesty!

322
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,748
Bhallaladeva!

323
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,540
Father!

324
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,213
He did it!

325
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,511
- Have you ever seen a mightier warrior!
- No, Prince!

326
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:07,767
Your loyalty amuses me,
Kattappa.

327
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,152
I know deep in your heart...

328
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,442
you nurture this
desire to kill me.

329
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:19,945
Yet you put your life
on the line to save mine.

330
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:21,746
How do you do it?

331
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,373
How do you manage to do this?

332
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,123
Alright! You deserve it!
Ask for a reward.

333
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:31,881
Ask for anything!

334
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:35,714
Your Majesty!

335
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:41,634
You have been holding Devasena
captive for 25 years.

336
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,643
Please release her.

337
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:53,611
So be it.
Since I have given my word.

338
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:57,983
Go and kill Devasena
and release her!

339
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:06,123
There is no greater liberation
than death! Go and release her!

340
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:09,661
No?

341
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,213
Then let her suffer.

342
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:17,377
Not just another 25 years,
but till she dies.

343
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:56,587
Hey old hag! Get up!

344
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,595
Hey! Get up.

345
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:49,261
Hey Devasena! I hope there is
nothing lacking in your torture!

346
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:55,767
You chose him over me.

347
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,441
So where is he now?

348
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,983
Tell me the truth, Devasena.

349
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,573
In all these years...

350
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:11,245
have you ever heard
anyone even utter his name?

351
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:17,589
On those long and dark night,
amid the desperate silence...

352
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:21,008
and in the clunk
of your shackles...

353
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,503
did you ever hear his name?

354
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:29,596
<i>No.</i>

355
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:34,142
Mahishmati has forgotten him,
Devasena.

356
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:37,104
They neither talk
about him anymore...

357
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,652
and nor do they remember him.

358
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:44,365
There are only two people in
this kingdom that remember him.

359
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,984
You and I.

360
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:51,243
You remember him as you want
to see him before you die.

361
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:55,121
And I remember him
as I want to kill him again...

362
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,744
with my bare hands.

363
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,878
But both our wishes
will remain unfulfilled.

364
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:21,621
Lady Devasena!

365
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,712
At least, accept it now.

366
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,627
You just have to say yes...

367
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,129
and I will break these shackles
and set you free.

368
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:34,767
Do you want to be a prisoner
for all your life?

369
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:38,638
No, Kattappa.

370
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:44,436
My son will come
and he will set me free.

371
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:48,940
How can your dead child
come back for you?

372
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,241
My son is alive.

373
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:55,238
He will come looking for me!

374
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:57,532
You are suffering
in the name of a son...

375
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:00,205
who is no longer alive, My Lady!

376
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,754
Please get a grip on yourself.

377
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:07,125
I won't get a chance
like this once again.

378
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,129
The guards on the night shift
will be here any moment.

379
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,380
Please agree!

380
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,265
Please accept it.

381
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:20,896
I am begging you and you
keep doing these silly things!

382
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:37,747
Do you think I am picking twigs
like a mad woman, Kattappa?

383
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,874
This is a funeral pyre!

384
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:50,259
This is for a funeral pyre
to burn to ashes...

385
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:55,014
the body and the
blood of Bhallaladeva.

386
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,893
My son will come...

387
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:03,226
he will drag that animal...
and place him on this pyre.

388
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:06,233
My son will make me
light the pyre...

389
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:08,645
while Bhalla is still alive.

390
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:12,114
The death cries of
Bhallaladeva will reverberate...

391
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:16,194
beyond the walls of Mahishmati.

392
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:19,371
My son will come!

393
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:34,386
What happened, Avanthika?

394
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:38,007
Someone right here tattooed
my hand last night.

395
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:43,145
He will come back
once he sees me.

396
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:31,708
Avanthika?
What is on your shoulder?

397
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,799
- Avanthi..
- Go ahead, I will see you later!

398
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:45,096
Avanthi, listen!

399
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:13,371
You saw the painting on your shoulder?
Did you like it?

400
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:17,883
Why that sour face?
Can you smile a little?

401
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,146
Oh My God!

402
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,357
Hey! What is with the arrows?

403
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,067
You want to kill
this hunk of a man!

404
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:41,107
- Who are you?
- That is better.

405
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,154
My name is Shiva.
I come from village Ambuli.

406
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,777
I climbed this huge
mountain just for you..

407
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:51,329
What a girl!

408
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:20,771
See, you should listen.
Now you are in a hole.

409
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,233
Avanthika?

410
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:37,876
- Now tell me who are you?
- I am telling the truth.

411
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,339
- I climbed up the mountain..
- Shut up.

412
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,384
It is possible only for the
likes of the great Lord Shiva!

413
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:44,128
That is what I am saying.
I am Shiva!

414
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:51,727
I will tell you.
I will tell you everything.

415
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:57,562
- But before that I have to ask you one thing.
- What?

416
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:02,233
Who are you? Who are you?

417
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:10,536
You got a sword in your hand.

418
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:14,075
Not to mention body armour, anger
sparks flying from your eyes.

419
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:17,332
I am not asking about
this mask of yours!

420
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:21,382
I want to know the one
that is hidden beyond it.

421
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:27,220
Shall I tell you?

422
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:33,222
You are a woman and I am a man.

423
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,647
I have come here to love you.

424
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,976
Now that hurts.

425
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,649
This is mine.

426
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:33,945
I dropped it near the waterfall.

427
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:41,745
Did you really scale
the mountains to reach me?

428
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:45,084
Just for me?

429
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:50,132
I came all the way just to see
the smile behind the mask.

430
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:53,885
I still don't see it.

431
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:23,662
"Birds chirp and ask you
to take me along."

432
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:29,380
"Let there be thirst for love
and let our love grow",

433
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:36,254
"Listen to what
my heart echoes."

434
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:41,510
"Let the time stand still
and while love makes us alive."

435
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:46,514
"The life I lived all
these years has no value."

436
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:51,110
"But now I want to live for you."

437
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:56,531
"l made a pact with my heart."

438
01:02:56,690 --> 01:03:01,867
"l will be born a hundred times
for you."

439
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:06,742
"Birds chirp and ask you
to take me along."

440
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:12,756
"Let there be thirst for love
and let our love grow",

441
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:38,361
"l will write our love saga
on the skies."

442
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:43,366
"Let us be together for
the rest of our lives."

443
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:53,631
"Write it with your eyes and
make my heart your canvas."

444
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:57,751
"Being in love is so lovely."

445
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:03,139
"The life I lived all
these years has no value."

446
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:08,183
"But now I want to live for you."

447
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:17,906
"l made a pact with my heart. I will be
born a hundred times for you."

448
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:23,410
"Birds chirp and ask you
to take me along."

449
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:28,532
"l am growing thirsty for love,
let there be love."

450
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:33,875
"Listen to what
my heart echoes."

451
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:39,627
"Let the time stand still
and while love makes us alive."

452
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:05,661
This is something
the world has never seen.

453
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:08,618
A hundred foot
tall golden statue.

454
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:11,624
Even the Gods don't
get this honor.

455
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,834
Once this is erected,

456
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:16,998
your son,
our King Bhallaladeva's prestige...

457
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:19,336
will live on forever
in the entire world.

458
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:24,922
- Are all the arrangements done?
- Yes, Your Majesty!

459
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,015
There will be celebrations galore.

460
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:30,894
The applause and the din
will be unprecedented, My Lord!

461
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:56,627
Avanthika..

462
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:35,826
Frisk her!

463
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:12,786
Attack!

464
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:14,849
Baahubali..

465
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:21,640
My Lord! Forgive me, My Lord!
Please don't kill me!

466
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:25,770
My Lord! Forgive me, my Lord.

467
01:08:33,568 --> 01:08:34,945
Forgive me.

468
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:14,009
Shiva!

469
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:06,308
Please forgive me, Shiva.

470
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:09,015
I didn't know what else to do.

471
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:13,441
I cannot let go of you
nor can I abandon my duty..

472
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:15,897
You are mine, Avanthika.

473
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:18,992
Everything that is yours
is mine.

474
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:23,121
I also share your obligation.

475
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:35,750
I don't know who Devasena is.

476
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,469
If your goal is to free her

477
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:42,344
then I will bring her back!

478
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,760
This is my word.

479
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:55,779
"The pyre is lit and
I feel choked."

480
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:59,650
"Nevertheless there is a
yearning in my heart."

481
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:09,878
"Will there be sunrise again,
ask these shackles of mine?."

482
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:14,464
"0 Kingdom! See who
comes your way."

483
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:17,895
Mahishmati, you can breathe now.

484
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:20,859
My son is back.

485
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:23,524
Baahubali is back!

486
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:45,698
When the king's statue
is erected...

487
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:46,987
everyone must applaud!

488
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:49,151
When the king's statue
is erected

489
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,619
everyone must applaud!

490
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:37,454
No worries!

491
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:39,877
It is a hundred foot statue.

492
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:42,543
Won't it take a sacrifice
of a hundred heads?

493
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:46,109
Thank you.

494
01:16:56,987 --> 01:16:58,455
Baahubali..

495
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:03,036
- Baahubali?
- Baahubali.

496
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:05,629
- Baahubali!
- Baahubali!

497
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:09,922
Baahubali! Baahubali!

498
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:15,552
- Move it!
- Baahubali! Baahubali!

499
01:17:15,548 --> 01:17:18,267
Baahubali! Baahubali!

500
01:17:20,177 --> 01:17:25,024
Baahubali! Baahubali!

501
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:28,607
Baahubali! Baahubali!

502
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:37,620
Baahubali! Baahubali!

503
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:41,247
Hey!

504
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:43,124
Who was that?

505
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:52,761
Baahubali! Baahubali!

506
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:25,663
Baahubali! Baahubali!

507
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:32,170
Baahubali! Baahubali!

508
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:37,630
Baahubali! Baahubali!

509
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:01,369
Baahubali!

510
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:13,133
Baahubali! Baahubali!

511
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:53,714
- It is been fifteen days since my son left!
- Hold this.

512
01:19:53,914 --> 01:19:55,632
He hasn't returned yet.

513
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,634
I wonder if he is alright.

514
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,511
Our son carried Lord Shiva's idol
all by himself,

515
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:00,512
What can happen to him?

516
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:03,007
If he is alright,
why isn't he back?

517
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:05,642
Maybe he found his family.

518
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,895
He must have realized
we are his foster parents.

519
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:10,852
- Will he never come? Will he not call me mother again?
- Sanga.

520
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:12,899
People, hurry up, will you?

521
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:27,997
Come on.

522
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:38,133
Earlier you saw the fire
in my eyes and

523
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:40,215
trusted me to
carry out the mission.

524
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:43,506
Once again I request you
to have that belief in me.

525
01:20:44,298 --> 01:20:48,428
I know Shiva will rescue
Queen Devasena. Come with me.

526
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:51,767
Alright!

527
01:20:56,685 --> 01:21:00,781
"Mahasena!"

528
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:07,246
Who says that Baahubali,

529
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:09,998
the one who showed us the
righteous path is no more?

530
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:19,125
I am nothing, but a living dead.

531
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:24,422
You are dead and yet you are
alive in people's heart.

532
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:33,765
Baahubali! Baahubali!

533
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:38,607
The echo still lingers
in these walls.

534
01:21:39,353 --> 01:21:44,780
It felt like it was his statue
that was being erected!

535
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:48,245
Did the people express their
bottled-up feelings?

536
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:54,752
Or did they see someone?

537
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:57,584
No! Impossible!

538
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:01,587
Let us question the soldiers on duty...

539
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:02,967
as to who uttered the name
and why they did so!

540
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:04,215
Then the truth will come out,
grandfather.

541
01:22:44,543 --> 01:22:46,216
What are you doing here?

542
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:48,221
I.. - The king has ordered us
to come. Let us go.

543
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:04,654
Who first uttered the
name of Baahubali in the crowd?

544
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:12,200
Am I talking to these walls?

545
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:15,658
Speak! Or I will have
your tongues cut!

546
01:23:16,283 --> 01:23:20,254
- I didn't see who, My Lord!
- Stop it!

547
01:23:22,372 --> 01:23:24,841
Bunch of idiots as you are!
Didn't anyone of you see him?

548
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:26,464
I saw him, My Lord!

549
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:17,602
I have seen those eyes before!

550
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:22,900
- Bhadra! I want him alive.
- Let us go!

551
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:38,866
Hey, who are you?

552
01:24:55,549 --> 01:24:57,142
He is here! Catch him.

553
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:09,358
Catch him..

554
01:25:33,879 --> 01:25:34,971
That way..

555
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:33,442
Sound the alarm!

556
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,127
I have come to rescue you.

557
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:56,761
Kattappa, a marauder
has entered the palace

558
01:26:57,003 --> 01:26:58,596
and he set fire
to the King's chambers!

559
01:26:58,755 --> 01:27:00,257
You head north.

560
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:21,779
Kattappa, Chop off his legs and hands
but I want him alive.

561
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:24,661
- As you say, My Prince!
- I want him alive!

562
01:27:27,534 --> 01:27:28,706
Come on!

563
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:38,011
The alarm!

564
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,532
Attack!

565
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:52,729
Get up!

566
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:57,024
You lousy old hag!

567
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:01,192
All these years of punishment...

568
01:30:01,354 --> 01:30:03,106
for your infidelity
and still no shame!

569
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:09,655
The moment you see a man,
you take off with him!

570
01:31:17,013 --> 01:31:19,436
Kattappa! He is going to kill me!
He is going lo kill me!

571
01:31:19,641 --> 01:31:21,018
My Prince!

572
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:23,440
It is my duty to protect you!

573
01:31:25,939 --> 01:31:28,442
To get to you,

574
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:32,324
he has to go through me first!

575
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:40,896
Kattappa!

576
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:43,440
Kattappa!

577
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:55,532
Devasena!

578
01:32:58,698 --> 01:32:59,824
Attack!

579
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:02,540
They are going for Devasena.
Stop them.

580
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,333
Hail Mahishmati!

581
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:37,658
Shiva!

582
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:44,377
Siddha!

583
01:33:56,798 --> 01:34:00,018
"Mahasena!"

584
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:06,642
"Mahasena!"

585
01:34:11,563 --> 01:34:14,362
"Mahasena!"

586
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:14,713
Anila!

587
01:35:58,503 --> 01:36:02,508
Baahubali!

588
01:37:27,342 --> 01:37:30,016
You resurrected our lost hope.

589
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:31,721
You made a great
warrior out of him

590
01:37:31,888 --> 01:37:33,014
and brought him back to us.

591
01:37:33,181 --> 01:37:38,358
Kingdom of Mahishmati will be
eternally grateful to you.

592
01:37:56,037 --> 01:37:57,880
My mother looks at me

593
01:37:58,748 --> 01:38:00,876
with this sadness and
not the usual affection.

594
01:38:04,504 --> 01:38:06,131
I don't know who they are...

595
01:38:06,297 --> 01:38:08,015
and yet they look at me like
I am their God!

596
01:38:10,635 --> 01:38:12,763
And when I see the wounds
that tester on that lady...

597
01:38:13,262 --> 01:38:15,139
I have never met before,

598
01:38:16,808 --> 01:38:21,109
my blood boils and
my soul hurts! Why?

599
01:38:22,522 --> 01:38:23,774
Who am I?

600
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:29,871
You are the son of our savior (GOD)
Amarendra Baahubali.

601
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:34,079
You are the balm
for your mother Devasena

602
01:38:34,283 --> 01:38:36,001
who awaited your return
for 25 years.

603
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:39,543
You are the fruit of our.

604
01:38:39,664 --> 01:38:43,385
Queen Mother Sivagami's
ultimate sacrifice.

605
01:38:43,793 --> 01:38:47,388
<i>The story you need to know
began 50 years ago, my son.</i>

606
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:49,883
<i>This kingdom of Mahishmati
was established</i>

607
01:38:50,049 --> 01:38:53,019
<i>by your grandfather
Maharaja Vikramadeva.</i>

608
01:38:53,177 --> 01:38:56,101
<i>Though eider,
Bijjaiadeva was not crowned</i>

609
01:38:56,222 --> 01:38:58,224
<i>because of his conniving nature.</i>

610
01:38:58,391 --> 01:39:03,648
<i>But Bijjaiadeva blamed it only
on his physical disabilities</i>

611
01:39:04,105 --> 01:39:07,200
<i>and it caused
great turmoil in him.</i>

612
01:39:08,651 --> 01:39:12,201
<i>The King died.</i>

613
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:15,875
<i>He was survived by his subjects</i>

614
01:39:16,033 --> 01:39:19,207
<i>and the queen
who was six months pregnant.</i>

615
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:23,125
<i>Three months passed by and
Mahishmati continued to mourn.</i>

616
01:39:23,374 --> 01:39:26,844
<i>The King's sister-in-law
and Bijialadeva's wife, Sivagami</i>

617
01:39:27,003 --> 01:39:30,633
<i>took up the reins of the kingdom.</i>

618
01:39:31,757 --> 01:39:33,225
<i>Being an astute woman</i>

619
01:39:33,342 --> 01:39:35,219
<i>she focused on
the welfare of the people</i>

620
01:39:35,386 --> 01:39:37,514
<i>and defense of the kingdom.</i>

621
01:39:38,681 --> 01:39:41,525
<i>She could hear
the howls of the jackals</i>

622
01:39:41,684 --> 01:39:44,107
<i>making their move
towards the throne.</i>

623
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:50,781
<i>It was a dark new moon night.
The queen was in labor.</i>

624
01:39:57,867 --> 01:39:59,995
We could not save the queen,
My Lady!

625
01:40:05,041 --> 01:40:06,258
It is a boy!

626
01:40:31,692 --> 01:40:32,864
Baahubali!

627
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:43,125
The empty throne reminds
me of a widow's forehead.

628
01:40:43,287 --> 01:40:46,541
So, I will take the throne and
restore it to its former glory!

629
01:40:46,666 --> 01:40:48,509
Hail him!

630
01:40:48,751 --> 01:40:52,756
You all swore a solemn oath
to be loyal to this throne.

631
01:40:52,922 --> 01:40:55,345
A revolt at a time
when the kingdom mourns

632
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:58,303
goes against every tenet
of being a Kshatriya, Marthanda!

633
01:40:58,511 --> 01:41:00,229
Being a leader
is the first tenet

634
01:41:00,388 --> 01:41:02,140
of being a Kshatriya, Minister.

635
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:13,868
Lady Sivagami?

636
01:41:34,046 --> 01:41:38,096
All those who support this
royal family step to one side.

637
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:41,145
Who will support a woman,
Sivagami?

638
01:41:52,273 --> 01:41:53,650
Kattappa!

639
01:41:57,778 --> 01:42:00,827
They have soiled Mahishmati
with their revolt.

640
01:42:01,574 --> 01:42:03,451
Wash it off with their blood!

641
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:13,886
How can you stand and watch...

642
01:42:14,045 --> 01:42:15,592
while our people
are being hacked to death?

643
01:42:18,382 --> 01:42:22,432
Move! Kill that
slave and Sivagami!

644
01:42:23,804 --> 01:42:25,727
Kill Kattappa!

645
01:42:44,116 --> 01:42:48,337
You bribed and bought my people!
How conniving!

646
01:42:51,624 --> 01:42:55,720
Not conniving, Marthanda.
It is called the statecraft!

647
01:43:11,352 --> 01:43:14,196
Lady, you are a born
statesman and a warrior

648
01:43:14,355 --> 01:43:15,902
and we had the privilege to witness it.

649
01:43:16,023 --> 01:43:19,653
Please ascend the throne
and rule Mahishmati!

650
01:43:19,819 --> 01:43:22,993
No, Minister.
That is not my place.

651
01:43:23,155 --> 01:43:26,659
- Then <i>whose</i> is it? O! Lady!
- What kind of a question is that, minister?

652
01:43:26,784 --> 01:43:31,381
It belongs to my son,
Bhallaladeva.

653
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:33,002
Tell him, Sivagami!

654
01:43:53,269 --> 01:43:57,365
Both my sons have
a right to the throne.

655
01:43:57,982 --> 01:44:03,785
The one with more valour,
compassion and wisdom

656
01:44:03,904 --> 01:44:05,872
will be crowned
the king of Mahishmati.

657
01:44:07,783 --> 01:44:11,003
This is my word
and my word is the law!

658
01:44:15,791 --> 01:44:20,791
"You found in her
an ocean of affection."

659
01:44:27,636 --> 01:44:32,636
"May you live long,
my dear Baahubali."

660
01:44:48,407 --> 01:44:53,755
"Ambrosia and venom."

661
01:44:55,539 --> 01:45:02,889
"Mind is where
they both get churned."

662
01:45:15,142 --> 01:45:19,113
"The scion of Mahishmathi"

663
01:45:19,271 --> 01:45:23,868
"the heir to the throne
the only one.. Baahubali."

664
01:45:27,029 --> 01:45:31,000
"He roars like a lion in the
battlefield." - Rest for now.

665
01:45:31,242 --> 01:45:34,712
"He is nothing,
but a thunderstorm."

666
01:45:42,044 --> 01:45:44,217
Kattappa! I am very hungry.

667
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:45,848
Can I have some?

668
01:45:46,006 --> 01:45:47,258
My Prince!

669
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:50,144
Why are you standing?
Please sit down.

670
01:45:52,763 --> 01:45:54,106
Now give me some.

671
01:45:55,140 --> 01:45:57,859
My Prince!, your mere
presence here is wrong.

672
01:45:58,018 --> 01:45:59,986
And then to sit with us
to break bread?

673
01:46:00,938 --> 01:46:03,441
I am hungry.
Your lectures won't help me.

674
01:46:04,275 --> 01:46:05,652
There is a spread
of delicacies ready

675
01:46:05,818 --> 01:46:07,070
for you in your royal chambers.

676
01:46:07,278 --> 01:46:09,872
I know. What is wrong
with this food?

677
01:46:10,030 --> 01:46:12,078
Just the aroma is
making my mouth water.

678
01:46:12,241 --> 01:46:14,539
You know what is wrong,
My Prince.

679
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:17,709
You are royalty
and we are slaves.

680
01:46:17,872 --> 01:46:21,376
Alright! As the Prince
of Mahishmathi, I command you.

681
01:46:24,044 --> 01:46:25,261
Feed me, uncle.

682
01:47:00,873 --> 01:47:03,126
"Now has risen the sword
that will condemn."

683
01:47:03,292 --> 01:47:05,511
"Now flies the arrow
that will pierce."

684
01:47:05,669 --> 01:47:07,842
"His enemies remain astonished."

685
01:47:08,005 --> 01:47:14,889
"They don't know where
to run or hide."

686
01:47:46,377 --> 01:47:47,629
Bhallaladeva!

687
01:47:59,139 --> 01:48:00,607
Great Bhalla!

688
01:48:01,684 --> 01:48:04,654
When I become the King,
you will be my commander!

689
01:48:28,419 --> 01:48:30,513
Both the princes have excelled

690
01:48:30,671 --> 01:48:32,139
in their training as
warriors and scholars.

691
01:48:32,297 --> 01:48:34,095
They stand as equals.

692
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:39,723
How are you going to decide who
will be crowned, Queen Mother?

693
01:48:41,807 --> 01:48:44,856
God has blessed both my
children with equal strengths.

694
01:48:45,019 --> 01:48:47,021
Now he is testing me

695
01:48:47,146 --> 01:48:50,901
with the difficult decision
I have to make!

696
01:48:51,025 --> 01:48:54,780
Make their next challenges
much more difficult.

697
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:09,714
<i>Before she could decide
on who will ascend the throne</i>

698
01:49:09,918 --> 01:49:12,888
<i>the Queen Mother was
faced with a new crisis.</i>

699
01:49:13,047 --> 01:49:16,267
<i>It's the form of one
of their trusted Saketa.</i>

700
01:49:19,053 --> 01:49:23,024
Saketa killed the guards
and stole our military secrets.

701
01:49:25,392 --> 01:49:27,770
- Call for the Princes!
- As you wish.

702
01:49:28,395 --> 01:49:30,989
<i>The young Princes searched</i>

703
01:49:31,148 --> 01:49:33,992
<i>for the traitor
in neighboring kingdoms.</i>

704
01:49:34,151 --> 01:49:36,654
<i>Finally they found out
that he was hiding</i>

705
01:49:36,862 --> 01:49:38,785
<i>in</i> a <i>den of thieves
called Singapuram.</i>

706
01:49:38,906 --> 01:49:40,328
<i>It is a lawless place
where bandits</i>

707
01:49:40,532 --> 01:49:41,749
<i>thieves and murderers
gathered and mingled.</i>

708
01:49:41,909 --> 01:49:44,253
<i>Strangers who drew
attention to themselves</i>

709
01:49:44,411 --> 01:49:47,540
<i>were in mortal danger.</i>

710
01:49:57,174 --> 01:49:59,973
- I have never seen you before.
- I just got here.

711
01:50:00,135 --> 01:50:02,354
A hidden dagger! What is it for?

712
01:50:02,554 --> 01:50:03,897
Are you a spy?

713
01:50:10,395 --> 01:50:12,648
If our guards were this good..

714
01:50:12,815 --> 01:50:13,987
We wouldn't have
had the opportunity

715
01:50:14,149 --> 01:50:15,651
to see so many
different Kingdoms.

716
01:50:18,278 --> 01:50:19,951
Swords or smarts?

717
01:50:20,114 --> 01:50:21,616
Whichever is sharper.

718
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:30,966
Do you have a drink?

719
01:50:38,382 --> 01:50:39,508
Big one?

720
01:50:49,059 --> 01:50:50,356
Much bigger?

721
01:50:57,985 --> 01:50:59,237
Do you have money?

722
01:51:08,287 --> 01:51:11,382
I need something large enough
for all my brothers!

723
01:51:31,059 --> 01:51:33,027
Look what is happening there..

724
01:51:33,145 --> 01:51:34,317
Come on!

725
01:51:39,151 --> 01:51:42,200
Not just booze.
There is a lot more here.

726
01:52:06,261 --> 01:52:11,313
"Intoxication tonight,
your magic gets me high."

727
01:52:12,267 --> 01:52:17,319
"Your love surrounds me,
my love."

728
01:52:18,273 --> 01:52:24,076
"Let your lips find mine."

729
01:52:24,279 --> 01:52:30,002
"Come and steal myself from me."

730
01:52:30,244 --> 01:52:34,715
"You are the charming one."

731
01:52:36,166 --> 01:52:41,013
"You are the charming one."

732
01:52:42,297 --> 01:52:45,141
"Your words are as
intoxicating as a bunch"

733
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:48,144
"of ripe grapes
soaked in honey."

734
01:52:48,262 --> 01:52:53,735
"You know way to my heart,
you are the key to my soul."

735
01:52:54,268 --> 01:52:56,896
"Let me drink this love potion."

736
01:52:57,020 --> 01:53:00,115
"You are mine, just mine."

737
01:53:00,274 --> 01:53:05,246
"Intoxication tonight,
your magic gets me high."

738
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:12,003
"Your love surrounds me,
my love."

739
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:53,958
"Take me in your strong arms,
I want to live."

740
01:54:00,250 --> 01:54:05,882
"You got the magic, no one has."

741
01:54:12,262 --> 01:54:18,110
"You are something
I want to lose myself in."

742
01:54:18,268 --> 01:54:24,241
"l want to be your
and make you mine, too."

743
01:54:24,691 --> 01:54:28,366
"Come and enjoy me."

744
01:54:30,155 --> 01:54:34,535
"You are the charming one."

745
01:54:34,659 --> 01:54:35,956
"Yes, I am."

746
01:54:36,119 --> 01:54:41,125
"You are the charming one."

747
01:54:42,292 --> 01:54:45,136
"Don't shoot me
with love daggers."

748
01:54:45,295 --> 01:54:47,639
"Please listen to me, my love."

749
01:54:48,340 --> 01:54:51,139
"Let me drink this love potion."

750
01:54:51,134 --> 01:54:54,263
"You are mine, just mine."

751
01:54:54,262 --> 01:54:59,769
"Intoxication tonight,
your magic gets me high."

752
01:55:00,268 --> 01:55:05,775
"Your love surrounds me,
my love."

753
01:56:13,675 --> 01:56:16,770
Instead of being
tortured by you, I should..

754
01:56:16,928 --> 01:56:18,020
Bhalla!

755
01:56:51,254 --> 01:56:53,097
<i>Kattappa“.</i>

756
01:57:23,245 --> 01:57:26,875
Who did you sell our secrets to?
Tell me!

757
01:57:27,374 --> 01:57:28,876
Kalakeya!

758
01:57:32,754 --> 01:57:35,098
The Kalakeya's don't believe
in tactical attack.

759
01:57:35,674 --> 01:57:38,223
There is no limit
to their morbidity.

760
01:57:39,386 --> 01:57:41,639
If they barge into the kingdom

761
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:45,017
they will kill every
innocent child

762
01:57:46,268 --> 01:57:49,363
and violate every woman.

763
01:57:50,564 --> 01:57:53,238
They will destroy
and burn everything.

764
01:57:54,359 --> 01:57:57,203
This talk might scare
some small kingdoms.

765
01:57:57,571 --> 01:57:59,369
We have a standing
army of 25,000 soldiers.

766
01:57:59,573 --> 01:58:00,870
Why should we be scared?

767
01:58:01,533 --> 01:58:05,629
- How big is the Kalakeya army?
- One hundred thousand.

768
01:58:42,282 --> 01:58:44,455
When wild bulls barge into the crops

769
01:58:44,659 --> 01:58:49,460
and lands that the Kalakeya's
plunder, are both left barren.

770
01:58:58,381 --> 01:59:00,884
We have to defend our kingdom

771
01:59:01,635 --> 01:59:03,763
and we have to attack our
enemies at the same time.

772
01:59:04,262 --> 01:59:06,515
What military strategy
should we use to attack?

773
01:59:07,390 --> 01:59:08,767
"The trident strategy".

774
01:59:12,395 --> 01:59:17,071
It is one for the textbooks.
No one has ever used it.

775
01:59:17,275 --> 01:59:19,653
You want to go to war
with something untested?

776
01:59:19,819 --> 01:59:21,446
If no one has used it

777
01:59:21,655 --> 01:59:23,828
the Kalakeya's wouldn't
expect it either.

778
01:59:23,990 --> 01:59:26,209
That is why
we should implement it.

779
01:59:26,368 --> 01:59:29,622
- I second the plan.
- I approve it.

780
01:59:30,747 --> 01:59:34,502
It is the only way
into our kingdom.

781
01:59:34,668 --> 01:59:40,016
Kattappa, how big a force
do you need to stop them?

782
01:59:40,548 --> 01:59:42,221
Five thousand, Your Highness!

783
01:59:42,926 --> 01:59:47,102
I will use armour and spears
to erect a wall of iron.

784
01:59:47,222 --> 01:59:49,850
I will turn it into an
impregnable fortress.

785
01:59:51,810 --> 01:59:54,609
I will command the forces
to the north.

786
01:59:57,273 --> 01:59:59,867
I will take responsibility
for the south.

787
02:00:02,153 --> 02:00:03,621
According to our sources,

788
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:06,124
the Kalakeya chief
will stand back

789
02:00:06,282 --> 02:00:08,626
and send half his army forward.

790
02:00:09,411 --> 02:00:12,335
Our military formation
and our weapons...

791
02:00:12,747 --> 02:00:15,967
will repel that kind
of attack for three hours.

792
02:00:16,418 --> 02:00:20,969
But we have to kill
the chief during that time.

793
02:00:21,131 --> 02:00:24,431
Their army,
without a chief, will scatter!

794
02:00:24,634 --> 02:00:27,137
In the middle of that battle

795
02:00:27,262 --> 02:00:29,515
both princes with their cavalry

796
02:00:29,681 --> 02:00:32,525
will attack the Chief
from two sides.

797
02:00:32,684 --> 02:00:35,733
It will take them
at least three hours

798
02:00:36,229 --> 02:00:38,448
by the time they launch
a counter attack on us.

799
02:00:38,648 --> 02:00:41,117
That will be enough, mother.
Victory will be ours.

800
02:00:41,276 --> 02:00:44,997
Half that time will be enough
to behead him.

801
02:00:45,155 --> 02:00:48,250
Great! This will also
solve the conundrum

802
02:00:48,408 --> 02:00:50,536
of who should be the king.

803
02:00:52,787 --> 02:00:55,631
Yes! The one who kills
the Kalakeya chief

804
02:00:55,790 --> 02:00:58,009
will ascend the
throne of Mahishmathi!

805
02:00:59,794 --> 02:01:02,513
- My Lord has the perfect solution.
- Yes.

806
02:01:05,759 --> 02:01:09,309
Divide the rest of the army
equally between the Princes!

807
02:01:11,389 --> 02:01:13,232
Bhalla, Baahu.

808
02:01:13,808 --> 02:01:16,857
This is the opportunity to
pay tribute to your motherland!

809
02:01:17,353 --> 02:01:18,650
Accept it.

810
02:01:20,023 --> 02:01:22,902
- Hail Mahishmati!
- Hail Mahishmati!

811
02:01:27,030 --> 02:01:30,000
Your uncle has
treated you unfairly.

812
02:01:30,158 --> 02:01:34,334
He has only given you
tools to breach a fort.

813
02:01:34,788 --> 02:01:37,758
Of what use will those
be in an open battlefield?

814
02:01:38,792 --> 02:01:40,886
The arrow-machines
and the swords' chariot,

815
02:01:41,044 --> 02:01:43,012
all went to Bhallaladeva!

816
02:01:45,131 --> 02:01:47,259
You should have objected, Baahu!

817
02:01:50,804 --> 02:01:53,432
Your son shall ascend
the throne of Mahishmathi.

818
02:01:53,932 --> 02:01:57,061
- You brilliantly hoodwinked Baahubali!
- What hoodwink?

819
02:01:57,560 --> 02:02:01,781
If he can't even demand the
right army, the right weapons

820
02:02:02,649 --> 02:02:04,993
what is he going to do
on the battlefield tomorrow?

821
02:02:06,569 --> 02:02:08,867
I made the strong one
even stronger.

822
02:02:09,656 --> 02:02:12,876
It is not cheating,
it is statecraft!

823
02:02:13,660 --> 02:02:16,254
- Hey! Who is it?
- Forgive me, My Lord!

824
02:02:16,412 --> 02:02:17,834
The younger Prince
asked us to pull out

825
02:02:18,039 --> 02:02:19,586
the tents and bring them to him.

02:03:28,026 --> 02:03:31,246

- Invincible!
- Invincible!

833
02:04:05,939 --> 02:04:08,112
Welcome, Baahubali!

834
02:04:13,154 --> 02:04:22,962
Baahubali! Baahubali!

835
02:04:23,164 --> 02:04:25,258
Baahubali! Baahubali!

836
02:04:39,931 --> 02:04:42,980
Bahu, it is
a time-honored ritual.

837
02:04:43,101 --> 02:04:43,977
If you don't
sacrifice the animal

838
02:04:44,143 --> 02:04:46,237
- the soldiers will read it as a bad omen.
- Yes, My Prince!

839
02:04:46,396 --> 02:04:48,524
If you don't offer the sacrifice

840
02:04:48,690 --> 02:04:49,987
the Goddess will be angry.

841
02:04:50,149 --> 02:04:51,867
Why quench the
Goddess's thirst with

842
02:04:52,026 --> 02:04:53,744
the blood of
this innocent animal

843
02:04:54,112 --> 02:04:56,535
when my own blood
can be offered?

844
02:04:59,283 --> 02:05:01,832
- Hail Mahishmati!
- Hail Mahishmati!

845
02:05:01,995 --> 02:05:05,545
Hail Mahishmathi!
Hail Mahishmathi!

846
02:05:05,665 --> 02:05:07,963
Hail Mahishmathi!

847
02:05:08,167 --> 02:05:10,261
Hail Mahishmathi!

848
02:05:12,755 --> 02:05:13,881
Hail Mahishmathi!

849
02:05:21,806 --> 02:05:23,979
Mahishmathi will be
forgiving and benevolent!

850
02:05:26,644 --> 02:05:28,112
This is your last chance.

851
02:05:28,271 --> 02:05:31,616
Drop your weapons and run
and we will spare your lives.

852
02:05:46,664 --> 02:05:48,632
I heard that you promised
both your sons that

853
02:05:48,791 --> 02:05:51,340
the one who kills me
would be made king.

854
02:05:56,799 --> 02:05:59,518
And if both of them
die at my hands?

855
02:06:16,861 --> 02:06:19,535
I will conquer you
and your kingdom

856
02:06:19,697 --> 02:06:20,949
and then I will have
a son with you.

857
02:06:21,115 --> 02:06:22,708
You can make him the king!

858
02:06:31,626 --> 02:06:33,253
I want him alive.

859
02:06:34,295 --> 02:06:37,595
I want him to be alive
even after his arms and legs

860
02:06:37,757 --> 02:06:40,351
are cut off and he
lies in a pool of blood!

861
02:06:47,266 --> 02:06:52,113
When the vultures pluck out
his eyes and feast on his guts.

862
02:06:52,814 --> 02:06:54,782
He should be alive.

863
02:06:56,234 --> 02:06:58,077
Kattappa! <i>'</i> My Lady!

864
02:06:58,236 --> 02:07:00,330
Blow the conch
to begin the battle.

865
02:07:31,519 --> 02:07:32,771
It is ready.

866
02:07:32,937 --> 02:07:33,859
Arm the weapon.

867
02:07:39,652 --> 02:07:40,869
Fire!

868
02:07:46,784 --> 02:07:48,331
Baahubali's command!

869
02:08:15,938 --> 02:08:16,985
Get ready!

870
02:08:18,357 --> 02:08:20,200
Arm the weapons.

871
02:09:27,176 --> 02:09:28,302
Attack!

872
02:10:27,236 --> 02:10:29,364
Attack!

873
02:12:10,047 --> 02:12:12,846
- Well done, Baahubali!
- Well done.

874
02:12:42,288 --> 02:12:44,256
Soldiers. Attack.

875
02:12:44,415 --> 02:12:45,962
Attack!

876
02:13:05,144 --> 02:13:07,772
Hold! Hold strong!

877
02:13:23,913 --> 02:13:25,756
Swords group, step forward!

878
02:15:29,913 --> 02:15:32,132
Trident strategy begins!

879
02:18:01,273 --> 02:18:02,616
Stop-

880
02:18:08,781 --> 02:18:09,998
Bhallaladeva!

881
02:18:15,746 --> 02:18:16,998
My Prince?

882
02:18:28,383 --> 02:18:30,306
- My Prince!
- Army!

883
02:20:02,227 --> 02:20:05,231
Hold your lines!

884
02:20:13,030 --> 02:20:15,874
Hold your lines! Hold them!

885
02:20:59,910 --> 02:21:01,878
Our defenses are in tatters.

886
02:21:02,287 --> 02:21:04,460
We are seeing an enemy
flag on Mahishmati soil...

887
02:21:04,623 --> 02:21:05,624
for the first time!

888
02:21:05,791 --> 02:21:08,214
This is the death of us. Death!

889
02:21:08,794 --> 02:21:11,422
Death! Death!

890
02:22:01,888 --> 02:22:03,140
Death!

891
02:22:06,393 --> 02:22:07,861
Death!

892
02:22:11,273 --> 02:22:12,650
Soldiers!

893
02:22:20,532 --> 02:22:22,079
What is death?

894
02:22:23,744 --> 02:22:26,088
To think that the
enemy is stronger

895
02:22:26,246 --> 02:22:27,873
than our resolve, is death!

896
02:22:29,750 --> 02:22:34,130
Cowardice on the battlefield
is death!

897
02:22:36,048 --> 02:22:40,519
The cruel man insulted our
mother and he is still alive.

898
02:22:42,387 --> 02:22:45,516
Instead of presenting his
decapitated head at her feet

899
02:22:45,682 --> 02:22:48,026
we are turning our backs
to him and that is death!

900
02:22:53,023 --> 02:22:56,118
I will ride on to annihilate
that death!

901
02:22:57,235 --> 02:23:01,331
No rogue can ever harm
my mother or my motherland.

902
02:23:01,573 --> 02:23:05,749
I am about to rip them apart
and proclaim my war cry!

903
02:23:11,166 --> 02:23:13,260
Who is with me?

904
02:23:15,295 --> 02:23:16,638
Me!

905
02:23:16,797 --> 02:23:19,641
- Who will die with me?
- Me!

906
02:23:19,883 --> 02:23:24,639
- Who will vanquish that death and live on?
- Me!

907
02:23:26,348 --> 02:23:27,645
Me!

908
02:23:27,808 --> 02:23:32,359
Hail Mahishmathi!

909
02:23:32,646 --> 02:23:36,776
Hail Mahishmathi!

910
02:23:47,369 --> 02:23:48,996
Hail Mahishmathi!

911
02:23:50,580 --> 02:23:54,084
Hail Mahishmathi!

912
02:24:20,569 --> 02:24:21,786
Semupathy!

913
02:29:13,820 --> 02:29:16,073
<i>I want him alive when
the vultures pluck out his eyes</i>

914
02:29:16,239 --> 02:29:18,742
<i>and feast on his guts.</i>

915
02:29:19,576 --> 02:29:24,252
<i>His limbs are to be cut off
and his blood should flow!</i>

916
02:29:48,688 --> 02:29:49,985
My Son!

917
02:29:51,649 --> 02:29:54,653
Bhallaladeva! Bhallaladeva!

918
02:30:17,759 --> 02:30:19,136
My Son!

919
02:30:19,886 --> 02:30:26,235
My brave son killed
Kalakeya and won the battle!

920
02:30:31,523 --> 02:30:35,528
To the future king,
Bhallaladeva!

921
02:30:35,693 --> 02:30:38,993
Hail Bhallaladeva!
Hail Bhallaladeva!

922
02:30:40,532 --> 02:30:42,876
Bhallaladeva's valour
will be told in Mahishmati

923
02:30:43,034 --> 02:30:45,128
for generations to come!

924
02:30:45,745 --> 02:30:51,377
Tales of his victory will be
etched on shrines and temples.

925
02:30:51,918 --> 02:30:54,262
Today, I proclaim
my son Bhallaladeva

926
02:30:54,420 --> 02:30:57,765
as the commander of the
armed forces of Mahishmathi!

927
02:31:01,177 --> 02:31:05,148
I proclaim Baahubali
as the King of Mahishmathi!

928
02:31:13,815 --> 02:31:17,115
Sivagami,
What sort of a decision is this?

929
02:31:17,277 --> 02:31:22,249
My son, our son,
killed the Kalakeya chief!

930
02:31:22,407 --> 02:31:24,705
You saw it with your own eyes!

931
02:31:25,577 --> 02:31:29,081
He has to be the King! Only he!

932
02:31:29,581 --> 02:31:31,879
The merits of a King
are evaluated not

933
02:31:32,041 --> 02:31:33,839
by the number
of enemies he has killed

934
02:31:34,002 --> 02:31:36,505
but by the number of
his own people he has saved.

935
02:31:37,046 --> 02:31:38,013
During the battle.

936
02:31:38,172 --> 02:31:41,142
Bhallaladeva's focus was
only in vanquishing the enemy.

937
02:31:41,342 --> 02:31:44,346
Baahubali,
while killing the enemy

938
02:31:44,554 --> 02:31:47,023
also managed
to save his subjects.

939
02:31:48,016 --> 02:31:50,895
That is the difference
between a soldier and a king.

940
02:31:53,146 --> 02:31:56,650
If you kill a hundred men you will
be called a great warrior.

941
02:31:57,275 --> 02:32:01,655
But if you save one life,
you will be called God!

942
02:32:05,366 --> 02:32:06,993
So, saving a couple
of common men

943
02:32:07,160 --> 02:32:08,628
is now the
qualification to rule?

944
02:32:08,745 --> 02:32:11,123
Baahubali will be
crowned the King of.

945
02:32:11,289 --> 02:32:13,383
Mahishmati on an auspicious day.

946
02:32:14,417 --> 02:32:17,887
That is my word
and my word is law!

947
02:32:22,175 --> 02:32:24,598
Baahubali! Baahubali!

948
02:32:25,178 --> 02:32:30,025
Baahubali! Baahubali!

949
02:32:30,224 --> 02:32:32,192
Baahubali! Baahubali!

950
02:32:32,352 --> 02:32:36,653
- Baahubali!
- Baahubali!

951
02:32:36,814 --> 02:32:42,196
Baahubali! Baahubali!

952
02:32:52,747 --> 02:32:55,000
Amarendra Baahubali!

953
02:32:56,167 --> 02:32:59,762
Glory to him!

954
02:33:03,383 --> 02:33:06,637
Amarendra Baahubali!

955
02:33:07,220 --> 02:33:11,020
Glory to him!

956
02:33:11,224 --> 02:33:14,353
Glory to him!

957
02:33:16,646 --> 02:33:19,650
My Shiva is the son
of such a great king!

958
02:33:20,775 --> 02:33:23,449
We are so glad
to hear about him.

959
02:33:24,404 --> 02:33:27,658
I wish we can
see the great man once!

960
02:33:30,159 --> 02:33:31,627
He is no more.

961
02:33:33,287 --> 02:33:35,130
The savior is no more!
(THAT GOD IS NO MORE!)

962
02:33:42,380 --> 02:33:44,633
You said no enemy
could come near him.

963
02:33:45,133 --> 02:33:47,352
You said the weapons
were afraid to touch him?

964
02:33:48,928 --> 02:33:51,022
How did such
a great warrior die?

965
02:33:52,932 --> 02:33:56,436
More grievous than
the wound of a sword or a spear

966
02:33:57,353 --> 02:33:59,105
is a stab in the back, Mahendra.

967
02:33:59,564 --> 02:34:02,238
Who? Who was it?

968
02:34:05,528 --> 02:34:06,871
That traitor...

969
02:34:09,115 --> 02:34:10,332
was me!

970
02:34:27,550 --> 02:34:32,550
"Golden dreams
and great heartache."

971
02:34:41,355 --> 02:34:46,355
"churn in the depth of the soul
of this river called life."

972
02:34:52,909 --> 02:35:02,842
"When great mountains
lay in its path."

973
02:35:04,629 --> 02:35:09,629
"It cuts deep gorges through
the rock to keep flowing!"

974
02:35:17,141 --> 02:35:22,141
"This unstoppable, inexhaustible
river called life."

975
02:35:35,117 --> 02:35:41,625
"It is called
the river of life."

976
02:35:41,649 --> 02:35:57,649
