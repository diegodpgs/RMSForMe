1
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,936
Finish work!

2
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,395
Go to hut.

3
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:33,147
Yeah, that figures.

4
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,151
If the new prisoners see us
digging graves, they may run.

5
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,446
No time for jokes. Finish work!

6
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,657
Dig, dig.

7
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,451
How about putting us
on sick list?

8
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:48,788
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.

9
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,333
You no sick. You never sick.

10
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,044
Why you always play sick
to me, Shears?

11
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,172
Don't want one of these
over my head, I guess.

12
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,716
Captain Kanematsu...

13
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,636
...how about a butt?

14
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,555
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.

15
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,059
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favour.

16
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,062
When a man gives a gift
from the goodness of his heart...

17
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:17,149
...like you gave me that butt,
I remember it from the heart.

18
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,277
That's why...

19
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,406
...I want you to keep this lighter.

20
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,245
Think I stole it?

21
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,164
It belonged to that English kid
we just buried.

22
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,126
He willed it to me
for a favour I'd done him.

23
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,337
Before I pass on,
I want to do the same for you.

24
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,132
You funny man, Shears.

25
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,971
Okay, you go on sick list. Him too.

26
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,976
One of these days Colonel Saito
will catch you bribing him...

27
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,853
...then where'll we be?

28
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,858
Before that happens
we'll be far away from here, chum.

29
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,152
Far away.

30
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,863
Okay, let's knock off.

31
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,616
Here lies...

32
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,245
Weaver, I forgot who we just buried.

33
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,747
Thomson.

34
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,290
Yes.

35
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,584
Here lies
Corporal Herbert Thomson...

36
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:20,546
...serial number 01234567.

37
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:25,760
Valiant member of the King's Own
or the Queen's Own or something...

38
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,556
...who died of beriberi
in the year of our Lord, 1943...

39
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,267
...for the greater glory of...

40
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,645
- What did he die for?
- Come off it.

41
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,148
No need to mock the grave.

42
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,443
I don't mock the grave or the man.

43
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,571
May he rest in peace.

44
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,160
He found little enough of it
while he was alive.

45
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,362
"A" Company, mark time!

46
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:07,213
Mark time!

47
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,621
Halt.

48
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,877
Into line, left turn.

49
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,090
Stand easy.

50
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,309
We're gonna be a busy pair
of gravediggers, Weaver.

51
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,811
Well done, well done.

52
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,948
That colonel doesn't know
what he's in for.

53
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,452
- You gonna tell him the truth?
- Of course not.

54
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,746
You're neither an officer
nor a gentleman.

55
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,947
My name is Nicholson.

56
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,117
I am Colonel Saito.

57
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:58,801
In the name of
His Imperial Majesty...

58
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,886
...I welcome you.

59
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:05,057
I am the commanding officer
of this camp...

60
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,310
...which is Camp 16...

61
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,854
...along the great railroad...

62
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:16,485
...which will soon connect
Bangkok with Rangoon.

63
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:21,782
You British prisoners
have been chosen...

64
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:25,202
...to build a bridge
across the River Kwai.

65
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:30,416
It will be pleasant work,
requiring skill.

66
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:35,629
And officers will work
as well as men.

67
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:41,093
The Japanese army cannot
have idle mouths to feed.

68
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:46,306
If you work hard,
you will be treated well.

69
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:50,102
But if you do not work hard...

70
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,896
...you will be punished.

71
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,818
A word to you about escape.

72
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,155
There is no barbed wire.

73
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,449
No stockade.

74
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,451
No watchtower.

75
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,121
They are not necessary.

76
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,040
We are an island in the jungle.

77
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,210
Escape is impossible.

78
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,255
You would die.

79
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,886
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.

80
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:30,142
Let me remind you of
General Yamashita's motto:

81
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,269
"Be happy in your work."

82
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,938
Be happy in your work.

83
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:38,942
Dismissed.

84
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,159
Battalion, stand at ease.

85
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,827
Fall out, Major Hughes.

86
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,205
Battalion, stand easy.

87
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,500
Get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.

88
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,127
I'm gonna have a word
with this fellow. Colonel!

89
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,385
I heard your remarks just now, sir.

90
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:09,348
My men will carry on in the way
one expects of a British soldier.

91
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,935
My officers and I
will be responsible for their conduct.

92
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:17,272
You may have overlooked the fact
that the use of officers for labour...

93
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,858
...is expressly forbidden
by the Geneva Convention.

94
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,401
Is that so?

95
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,320
I have a copy of the Convention...

96
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,532
...and would be glad to
let you glance through it.

97
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,159
That will not be necessary.

98
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,455
Sit down, please.

99
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,507
Yes, sir.

100
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:11,219
- I'm gonna have a word with Clipton.
- Very good, sir.

101
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,514
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.

102
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,558
- How's the arm?
- Nearly healed.

103
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,728
Sir, this is Commander Shears
of the United States Navy.

104
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,688
- Good.
- How do you do, sir?

105
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,357
We found him and an Australian.

106
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,026
All that's left of the prisoners
who built the camp.

107
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,861
U.S. Navy? Out here?

108
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,113
For a sailor, I am sort of landlocked.

109
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,532
- You lost your ship?
- The Houston.

110
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:36,244
I made it ashore, but I got separated
from the other survivors.

111
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:37,871
And your group here?

112
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,332
Mostly Aussies. Some lime...

113
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,834
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.

114
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,753
And what happened to them?

115
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,380
They died...

116
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:51,802
...of malaria, dysentery,
beriberi, gangrene.

117
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,387
Other causes of death:

118
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:57,641
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds,
snakebites...

119
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,601
...Saito.

120
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:03,146
Then there were some
who just got tired of living.

121
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:04,648
Has Clipton seen you?

122
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:08,819
Just about to, sir. Come over here,
commander, you can shave later.

123
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,445
All right.

124
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,908
You'll stay with the officers.

125
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,868
We'll scrape up
some decent clothing.

126
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,537
Don't bother about me.

127
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,997
I'm not anxious to
get off the sick list.

128
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,084
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion out here.

129
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,461
The officers in your party
did manual labour?

130
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,380
I think you could call it that.

131
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,842
I raised that very point
with Colonel what's-his-name.

132
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,301
Saito.

133
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:36,680
- I think he understands now.
- Is that so?

134
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:39,975
Yes. I must say he seems
quite a reasonable type.

135
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,102
Well, I must be pushing on.

136
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,146
There's an officer's meeting at 7.

137
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,315
- Give me a list of your requirements.
- Yes, sir.

138
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,317
Anything we can do.

139
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,194
Oh, thank you, sir.

140
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,866
- What is it?
- Never mind.

141
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,909
Go on, say it.

142
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,871
I can think of a lot of things
to call Saito...

143
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:04,583
...but reasonable, that's a new one.

144
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,919
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson
defines the word differently.

145
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,096
Any other points?

146
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,931
- By your leave, sir?
- Yes, Jennings?

147
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,226
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Commander Shears...

148
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,312
There won't be any
escape committee.

149
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,148
I don't understand, sir.
Lieutenant Jennings has a plan.

150
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,151
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings
has a plan, but escape?

151
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,781
Where? Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.

152
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:40,035
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.

153
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,414
I'm sure a man of Commander Shears'
experience will back me up on that.

154
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:48,293
I'd say the odds against a
successful escape are 100 to one.

155
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,545
- Right.
- But may I add another word?

156
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:51,963
Please.

157
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:55,383
The odds against survival in this camp
are even worse.

158
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:58,512
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.

159
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,138
To give up hope of escape...

160
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:03,725
...to stop thinking about it,
is like accepting a death sentence.

161
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,561
Why haven't you tried to escape,
commander?

162
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:10,690
I'm biding my time. Waiting for
the right moment, the right company.

163
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,984
I understand how you feel.

164
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:18,114
Of course, it's the duty of a
captured soldier to attempt escape.

165
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,243
But my men and I are involved
in a curious legal point...

166
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,662
...of which you are unaware.

167
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:27,582
In Singapore we were ordered to
surrender by command headquarters.

168
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,501
Ordered, mind you.

169
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,463
Therefore, in our case, escape might
well be an infraction of military law.

170
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,799
- Interesting?
- Yes, sir, interesting point.

171
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:38,552
I'm sorry, sir,
I didn't quite follow you.

172
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:42,430
You intend to uphold the letter
of the law, no matter what it costs?

173
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,308
Without law, commander,
there is no civilisation.

174
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,937
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilisation.

175
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,982
Then we have the opportunity
to introduce it.

176
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,318
I suggest we drop
the subject of escape.

177
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,072
Is there anything else?

178
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,869
I think we're all clear
on the programme.

179
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,747
I want everything to go off without
a hitch starting tomorrow morning.

180
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,541
And remember this:

181
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,878
Our men must always feel
they are still commanded by us...

182
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,046
...and not by the Japanese.

183
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:19,551
So long as they have that idea,
they'll be soldiers and not slaves.

184
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,887
Are you with me there, commander?

185
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,016
Well, I...

186
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:29,519
I hope they can
remain soldiers, colonel.

187
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,897
As for me, I'm just a slave.

188
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,481
A living slave.

189
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,748
Queer bird. Even for an Ameri...

190
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,001
He's been in isolation too long,
poor chap.

191
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:57,339
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.

192
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,773
English prisoners!

193
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:20,612
Notice I do not say English soldiers.

194
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:26,701
From the moment you surrendered,
you ceased to be soldiers.

195
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:33,166
You will finish the bridge
by the 12th day of May.

196
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:38,213
You will work under the direction
of a Japanese engineer.

197
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:45,679
Time is short. All men will work.

198
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,974
Your officers will work beside you.

199
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,976
This is only just...

200
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,230
...for it is they
who betrayed you by surrender.

201
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,066
Your shame is their dishonour.

202
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,777
It is they who told you...

203
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,615
...better to live like a coolie
then die like a hero.

204
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,119
It is they who brought you here,
not I.

205
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:14,833
Therefore, they will join you
in useful labour.

206
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,127
That is all.

207
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:21,423
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.

208
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,217
Bradley, back in your place.

209
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,184
I must call your attention,
Colonel Saito...

210
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:36,104
...to Article 27
of the Geneva Convention.

211
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,482
"Belligerents may employ
prisoners of war...

212
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:41,776
...who are fit,
other than officers..."

213
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,278
Give me the book.

214
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,114
By all means.
You read English, I take it?

215
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,450
- Do you read Japanese?
- I'm sorry, no.

216
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,953
If it's a matter of translation,
I'm sure it can be arranged.

217
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:54,164
You see, the Code states that...

218
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,418
Stand fast in the ranks.

219
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,504
You speak to me of code?

220
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,257
What code?

221
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,676
The coward's code!

222
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,430
What do you know
of the soldier's code?

223
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:13,850
Of Bushido? Nothing!

224
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,561
You are unworthy of command!

225
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:32,535
Since you refuse to abide by the laws
of the civilised world...

226
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:36,414
...we must consider ourselves
absolved from our duty to obey you.

227
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,918
My officers will not
do manual labour.

228
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,878
We shall see.

229
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:48,885
All enlisted prisoners to work.

230
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,690
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.

231
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:06,611
Battalion, take up tools.

232
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:13,701
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!

233
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:18,706
"A" Company, by the right,
quick march.

234
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,377
Eyes right.

235
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,380
Eyes right.

236
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,973
Eyes front.

237
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,313
Eyes right.

238
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:47,068
Quick march, eyes right.

239
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,040
"C" Company, by the right.

240
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,084
What's he up to?

241
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,548
Looks like he doesn't
want any witnesses.

242
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:27,442
Now, you will be reasonable.

243
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,945
You will order your officers to work.

244
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,655
No.

245
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,688
I will count three.

246
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,899
If by the third count...

247
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:12,570
...you and your officers
are not on the way to work...

248
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,490
...I will give the order to fire.

249
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,168
He's going to do it.

250
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,213
Believe me,
he's really going to do it.

251
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:41,891
One.

252
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,601
I warn you, Colonel Saito.

253
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,353
Two.

254
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,732
Stop!

255
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,615
Colonel Saito,
I've seen and heard everything.

256
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,742
So has every man in the hospital.

257
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,452
There are too many witnesses.

258
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,623
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.

259
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:11,963
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?

260
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:28,122
You see, Jennings, there are certain
advantages to being on the sick list.

261
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,292
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.

262
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,795
"Into the valley of death
rode the 600."

263
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,463
How's that, sir?

264
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,632
That kind of guts.

265
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,634
Also the kind they had in 1914...

266
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,553
...when officers fought
with only a swagger stick.

267
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:46,057
- I see what you mean.
- You don't see what I mean at all.

268
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,185
The kind of guts
that can get us all killed.

269
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:33,604
Excuse me, sir,
I'd like to go along too.

270
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:37,775
Arm's almost healed, sir,
really it is.

271
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,069
What about him?

272
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:43,739
He didn't order us not to escape,
he suggested.

273
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:48,828
Listen, when a man like your colonel
suggests something, it's an order.

274
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,539
Here we go again.

275
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:05,094
Colonel Saito says all officers
to punishment hut.

276
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:07,180
Tell them to go.

277
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:16,898
Not you.

278
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,079
Come.

279
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:54,894
Leave him alone!

280
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,397
Leave him alone!

281
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,327
They're gonna put him in the oven.

282
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:20,229
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

283
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:24,150
For he's a jolly good fellow

284
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:26,694
And so say all of us

285
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:31,699
And so say all of us
And so say all of us

286
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:37,038
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

287
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,791
For he's a jolly good fellow

288
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,336
And so say all of us

289
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,841
Timber!

290
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:01,974
One, two, three, four.

291
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:07,229
One, two, three, four.

292
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,859
No, no, no!

293
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,861
Let go!

294
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,697
Let go!

295
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,413
You wish to see me?

296
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,916
I've been trying to see you
for three days.

297
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:12,211
It's about Colonel Nicholson.
He's been shut up in that hut...

298
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,424
I could have you shot.

299
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:22,263
Those prisoners who tried to escape,
they were in your charge.

300
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,348
I knew nothing about the escape.

301
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,184
It does not matter.

302
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,312
One must even respect
those who tried.

303
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:34,316
For a brief moment,
between escape and death...

304
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:36,277
...they were soldiers again.

305
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,448
But it is insane to try and escape.

306
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:45,953
Two soldiers shot,
the third drowned.

307
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,663
To what end?

308
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:50,749
It was an escape from reality.

309
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,759
There is your reality.

310
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:05,764
This shows the position work
should have reached by noon today.

311
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:09,852
And this shows the position
of actual progress.

312
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:14,440
Because of your
colonel's stubbornness...

313
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:16,775
...we are far behind schedule.

314
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,068
That is not all.

315
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,572
Enlisted prisoners
sabotaged the work.

316
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:25,743
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.

317
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,621
Then who would build your bridge?

318
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:30,831
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?

319
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:34,126
Perhaps the men don't work well
without their own officers.

320
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:39,173
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.

321
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:43,302
That's for Colonel Nicholson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.

322
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,638
Do not speak to me of rules.

323
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,681
This is war!

324
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,017
This is not a game of cricket.

325
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,649
He's mad, your colonel...

326
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,027
...quite mad.

327
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:04,531
Sit down, please.

328
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:13,415
I have decided to allow you
one visit to your colonel.

329
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,125
Thank you.

330
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:19,838
Tell him that if his officers
will not work...

331
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:23,050
...I'll be forced
to close the hospital...

332
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,679
...and your patients will
work in their place.

333
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:31,266
And many will die,
and he will be responsible.

334
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:35,980
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.

335
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,636
Hey, the doc's going
to see the old man.

336
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:12,766
Sir...

337
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:18,605
It's Clipton, sir.

338
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,609
I brought you a few things.

339
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:30,451
- How are the men?
- Fine, sir, fine.

340
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:34,872
We scraped together a little meat
and a coconut.

341
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,543
And the officers?

342
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,504
Oh, they're not so good.
They're still in detention.

343
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:46,967
And Lieutenant Jennings...
Jennings is dead.

344
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,720
- What?
- Killed, attempting to escape.

345
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:53,432
Also two others,
Corporal Weaver and the American.

346
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:58,145
Jennings. Poor, brave lad.

347
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,564
I warned him, didn't I, Clipton?

348
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,650
Look, sir, we haven't much time.

349
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,449
I'm going to clean you up a little
while I talk.

350
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,826
I've got something to tell you.

351
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:15,537
I've just had a word with Saito.

352
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:19,458
That man is the worst commanding
officer I've ever come across.

353
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:23,545
Actually, I think he's mad. Carry on.

354
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,230
Blackmail.

355
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:46,110
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.

356
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,988
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
And he can't give in.

357
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,574
It's still blackmail.

358
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:59,331
Sir, you can't stand
much more of this.

359
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:04,753
Wouldn't the officers be better off
working than suffocating in that hole?

360
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:10,008
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.

361
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:13,303
But Saito's cut their food rations...

362
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:15,639
...and if he makes
the sick men work...

363
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,726
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.

364
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,729
Yes, Clipton, I understand. Truly.

365
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,524
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.

366
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:29,570
If we give in now,
there'll be no end to it. No.

367
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:37,077
Sir, we're lost in the jungle,
a thousand miles from anywhere.

368
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:40,789
We're under the heel of a man
who'll stop at nothing to get his way.

369
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:41,999
Principle!

370
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,378
No one will ever know or care
what happens to us.

371
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,131
Give in, sir. Please!

372
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,841
I'm adamant.

373
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:54,803
I will not have an officer
from my battalion working as a coolie.

374
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,097
- Time.
- All right.

375
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:02,519
Please thank those concerned.

376
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:05,647
Everybody in the hospital
contributed one piece.

377
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:07,524
Reynolds stole the coconut.

378
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,987
We'll be able to get you
something from time to time.

379
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:14,615
We've bribed one of your guards.

380
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,833
Goodbye, sir. And good luck.

381
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,627
Many thanks.

382
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:33,717
- Clipton!
- Yes, sir?

383
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,637
Did you say that American chap
was killed?

384
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,014
Yes, sir. Shot and drowned.

385
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:43,602
It's insane to plan escapes.

386
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:47,689
Three men killed, and to what end?

387
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:49,942
- Time!
- Here.

388
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,486
- Here is where we must win through.
- Time, time!

389
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:16,760
The doc just looked at us and shook
his head. Whatever that means.

390
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:20,555
Means only one thing,
colonel won't give in.

391
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:34,653
Well?

392
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:36,571
It's like this.

393
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,491
Colonel Nicholson
won't give in to force.

394
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,868
It's a question of principle.

395
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:45,580
As medical officer, I protest
to the way he's being treated.

396
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,791
It's a wonder he's still alive.

397
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:52,004
Should a tragedy occur,
it would be tantamount to murder.

398
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,383
He is responsible.

399
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,052
Not I.

400
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:10,939
You sick?

401
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:16,778
Are they both mad?

402
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:20,324
Or am I going mad?

403
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:23,702
Or is it the sun?

404
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:27,802
Attention!

405
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,765
Battalion, attention.

406
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,770
English prisoners.

407
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:39,481
Let us ask the question...

408
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:42,901
...why does the bridge not progress?

409
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:48,615
You know why,
because your officers are lazy!

410
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:53,245
They think themselves too good
to share your burden.

411
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:55,789
This is not just.

412
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,209
Therefore, you are not happy
in your work.

413
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:03,421
Therefore, the bridge
does not progress.

414
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,216
But there is another cause.

415
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:09,511
I do not hide the truth.

416
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,639
With deep shame and regret...

417
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,183
...I admit to you the failure...

418
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,270
...of a member of the Japanese staff.

419
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:20,730
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.

420
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:23,400
He is a bad engineer.

421
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:25,902
He is unworthy of command.

422
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:30,865
Therefore, I have removed him
from his post.

423
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:36,663
Tomorrow we begin again.

424
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:40,375
I shall be in personal command.

425
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,961
Today we rest.

426
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:49,551
All work and no play
make Jack a dull boy.

427
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:53,513
As token of regard
for your efforts in the future...

428
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,308
...I give presents to you all.

429
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:11,031
Let us be happy in our work.

430
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,701
Company, dismissed.

431
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:19,581
Battalion, dismissed.

432
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,222
Hey, take a look at this.

433
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,516
Red Cross! He's given us our...

434
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:42,520
Hey, he's given us
our own Red Cross parcels.

435
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:46,066
"Tomorrow we begin again."

436
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:53,133
Hey, Harry, look.

437
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:55,593
They're letting the old man out.

438
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:21,161
Most likely gonna give him
another pasting.

439
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:06,956
Good evening, colonel.

440
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:16,007
Do you mind sitting over here?

441
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:19,761
I am having rather a late supper.

442
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:45,203
English corned beef.

443
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,705
No, thank you.

444
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:55,547
Produce of Scotland.

445
00:52:57,258 --> 00:52:59,509
I prefer it to sake.

446
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,679
I spent three years in London,
you know.

447
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:06,599
I studied at the London Polytechnic.

448
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,561
Cheers.

449
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,437
Sorry.

450
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:13,481
Later, perhaps?

451
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,358
Perhaps.

452
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:23,283
I was not a good artist.

453
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:25,827
My father disapproved.

454
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:28,496
He felt I belonged in the army.

455
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:33,293
So I changed from art
to engineering.

456
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:38,089
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.

457
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:42,093
I intend to make a full report
of your activities in this camp.

458
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:51,227
I do not think you quite
realise my position.

459
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:54,856
- I must carry out my orders.
- Oh, quite, quite.

460
00:53:55,024 --> 00:53:59,152
My orders are to complete the bridge
by the 12th day of May.

461
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,155
- I have only 12 weeks more.
- No doubt.

462
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:07,118
Therefore, I am compelled
to use all available personnel.

463
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:10,204
But no officers, except in
an administrative capacity.

464
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:14,584
But officers are working
along the entire railway.

465
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,502
You know it. I know it.

466
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,589
I'm not responsible
for the actions of other officers.

467
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,299
Personally, I'm appalled.

468
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,927
Let's not get excited.

469
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,059
Will you have a cigar?

470
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,269
No. Thank you.

471
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:38,775
When I said all officers must work...

472
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:42,445
...naturally, I never meant you,
the commanding officer.

473
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:46,783
My orders were only intended
for officers below...

474
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:49,285
None of my officers
will do manual labour.

475
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:52,747
Please! I was about to say:

476
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:56,334
I've been thinking the matter over
and have decided...

477
00:54:56,543 --> 00:55:01,047
...to put majors and above
on administrative duties...

478
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:04,050
...leaving only junior officers
to lend a hand.

479
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:07,804
I'm afraid not. The Convention's
quite clear on that point.

480
00:55:21,402 --> 00:55:26,155
Do you know what will happen to me
if the bridge is not ready in time?

481
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:28,074
I haven't the foggiest.

482
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,910
I'd have to kill myself.

483
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:34,080
What would you do if you were me?

484
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:37,166
I suppose if I were you...

485
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,086
...I'd have to kill myself.

486
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:43,506
Cheers.

487
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:47,301
I warn you, colonel...

488
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:52,015
...if I am to die,
others will die before me.

489
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,558
Do you understand that?

490
00:55:53,726 --> 00:55:56,394
- Major Clipton did mention that.
- Well?

491
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:59,105
That won't solve your problem.

492
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,774
But I'm sure we can arrive
at a proper solution.

493
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:03,651
Please sit down.

494
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:10,324
Now, tell me, colonel...

495
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:14,328
...do you agree that the first job
of an officer is command?

496
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,456
- Of course.
- Good.

497
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:20,209
Now...

498
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,714
Take this bridge of yours.

499
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:27,592
It's quite an enormous undertaking.

500
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,888
Frankly, I have grave doubts whether
your lieutenant... What's his name?

501
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:34,515
- Miura.
- Miura.

502
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:38,895
...is capable of tackling
a job of such importance.

503
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:44,525
On the other hand, I have officers,
Reeves and Hughes for instance...

504
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:48,488
...who have built bridges
all over India.

505
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,199
The men respect them.

506
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:54,994
It's essential for an officer to have
that respect, I'm sure you agree.

507
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:56,954
If he loses it,
he ceases to command.

508
00:56:57,164 --> 00:57:00,166
And what happens then?
Demoralization and chaos.

509
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:03,795
A pretty poor commander I would be
if I allowed that to happen.

510
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,880
Perhaps you are not aware...

511
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:09,300
...that the bridge is now
under my personal command.

512
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:13,262
Really? And may I ask,
are you satisfied with the work?

513
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,765
- I am not!
- You've proved my point.

514
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,309
I hate the British!

515
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:21,687
You are defeated
but you have no shame.

516
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:24,357
You are stubborn
but have no pride.

517
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:27,276
You endure
but you have no courage.

518
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,612
I hate the British!

519
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:32,532
Pointless, going on like this.

520
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,117
Stay there!

521
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:13,336
Stand down. Stand down!

522
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:25,348
Battalion, attention!

523
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:08,099
Battalion, stand at ease.

524
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,144
Please...

525
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:16,315
Do you know what is
the date today, colonel?

526
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:18,359
I'm afraid I've lost count.

527
01:02:18,527 --> 01:02:21,320
It's the anniversary of
our great victory...

528
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:24,323
- ...over Russia in 1905.
- Oh, yes.

529
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:28,577
Throughout East Asia
we are celebrating this date.

530
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,746
In honour of this occasion...

531
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:33,749
...I have given your troops
a day of rest.

532
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,167
Many thanks.

533
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:38,504
I am declaring a general amnesty.

534
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:42,216
You and your officers may
return to your quarters.

535
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,718
As part of this amnesty...

536
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:50,391
...it will not be necessary
for officers to do manual labour.

537
01:03:20,464 --> 01:03:21,630
He's done it!

538
01:05:44,733 --> 01:05:46,984
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.

539
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:00,247
How many men in your party?

540
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:02,625
Well, I don't really know, sir.

541
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:05,127
- You don't know?
- Sir, 12, usually.

542
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:09,673
But, well, one of the men took sick
very suddenly this morning, sir.

543
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:12,301
It took three or four
to help him to the hospital.

544
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:17,640
And... He took terrible sick, sir.

545
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:21,602
A corporal should always know
how many men he has under him.

546
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:24,104
Oh, yes, sir.

547
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:28,942
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces at once.

548
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:34,490
It may be funny to you,
but it's not military behaviour.

549
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:35,991
No, sir.

550
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:41,664
We must put a stop
to these demonstrations.

551
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,457
Yes, sir.

552
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:54,760
- I say, Reeves?
- Yes, sir?

553
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:58,514
You ever constructed a bridge
across a stream like the Kwai?

554
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:02,351
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them,
in Madras, Bengal...

555
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:04,561
If this were your bridge...

556
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:07,481
...how would you get it under way?

557
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,235
Get it under way, sir?

558
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:14,113
Well, first of all,
I wouldn't build it here.

559
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,448
Oh, why not?

560
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:18,367
As I was trying to tell you...

561
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:22,788
...the Japanese couldn't have picked
a worse location. There's no bottom.

562
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:25,207
You see those piles?

563
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,084
They're sinking.

564
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:33,340
Our chaps could drive those logs
till doomsday and they wouldn't hold.

565
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:35,634
Where would you build it?

566
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:39,847
Why, further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.

567
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:42,933
Then we'd have solid bedrock
on both banks.

568
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:47,938
Hughes, if this were your bridge,
how would you use the men?

569
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:52,443
Well, sir, not the way they're doing it.
It's utter chaos, as you can see.

570
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:56,530
It's a lot of uncoordinated activity.

571
01:07:56,698 --> 01:07:58,365
No teamwork.

572
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:03,162
Some of those parties are actually
working against each other.

573
01:08:05,457 --> 01:08:06,707
Yes.

574
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:13,380
I tell you, gentlemen, we have
a problem on our hands.

575
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:16,383
Thanks to the Japanese,
we now command a rabble.

576
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:19,011
There's no order, no discipline.

577
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:23,432
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
- Yes, sir.

578
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,434
Which isn't going to be easy.

579
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:29,271
But fortunately, we have
the means at hand. The bridge.

580
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,940
- The bridge, sir?
- The bridge.

581
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:39,031
We'll teach them a lesson in Western
efficiency that will put them to shame.

582
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:41,950
We'll show them what
the British soldier is capable of.

583
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,870
Yes. I see your point, sir.

584
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:47,873
I realise how difficult
it's going to be here...

585
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:50,542
...where you can't find
what you need.

586
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:53,879
- But there's the challenge.
- I beg your pardon, sir.

587
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:56,590
You mean, you really want them
to build the bridge?

588
01:08:56,758 --> 01:08:59,468
You're not usually
so slow on the uptake, Evans.

589
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:02,596
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.

590
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:05,974
Fact is, if there weren't any work,
we'd invent some, eh, Reeves?

591
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:09,061
- That we would, sir.
- So we're lucky.

592
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:11,814
But it's going to be a proper bridge.

593
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:14,191
Here again I know the men.

594
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:17,444
It's essential that they
take pride in their job.

595
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:19,279
- Right, gentlemen?
- Yes, sir.

596
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:22,407
Reeves, you're the key man
in this situation, as engineer.

597
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:26,578
Tell me what you want and we'll
organise it. Can we make a go of it?

598
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:29,081
- We'll do our best, sir.
- Fine.

599
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:32,626
We must draw up our plans...

600
01:09:33,253 --> 01:09:35,963
...then arrange a conference
with Saito...

601
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,674
...and set him straight.

602
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:48,141
Well, I think that takes care of all
the procedural matters. Now...

603
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:49,935
Oh, yes.

604
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:54,356
The next point is somewhat unpleasant
for all concerned, I'm afraid.

605
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:58,235
Sorry to tell you, we feel the position
of the bridge was fixed hastily...

606
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:00,779
...and, I have to add, incorrectly.

607
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:04,700
Incorrectly?

608
01:10:04,868 --> 01:10:06,451
Unfortunately, yes.

609
01:10:06,661 --> 01:10:09,371
Our engineer has made
a study of the site...

610
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:12,958
...and has concluded that
the river bottom there is too soft.

611
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:15,043
Too soft?

612
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:17,754
Mud. All the work up to now
has been useless.

613
01:10:18,006 --> 01:10:21,008
- Reeves, will you carry on?
- Yes, sir.

614
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:22,593
Colonel, I've made tests.

615
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:26,555
Those piles of yours could be hammered
below water level before they'd hold.

616
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:29,516
That bridge would collapse
under the first train.

617
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:33,854
The pressure and soil resistance
figures in tons per square inch.

618
01:10:34,022 --> 01:10:36,565
Just a moment, Reeves,
before you get too involved.

619
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:39,318
Colonel, do you suppose
we could have a cup of tea?

620
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:56,376
Then I take it we all agree
that if we're to avoid disaster...

621
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:59,254
...we build a new bridge,
at the site picked by Reeves...

622
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:01,882
...400 yards downstream.

623
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,721
So let's proceed to the next point.

624
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:11,266
I've decided to alter
the daily work quota of our men.

625
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:13,226
- Alter?
- Yes, I've increased it.

626
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:15,979
From a yard and a half
of earth moved to two.

627
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:19,024
I was sure it would meet
with your approval.

628
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:22,527
Major Hughes has all the facts.
Hughes, would you take over?

629
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:25,781
I've done a time study, Colonel Saito,
of the entire project.

630
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:29,785
As you can see, the available forces
have been badly distributed.

631
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:33,830
I would strongly urge we revise the
organisation of the working parties.

632
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:39,252
Just a moment. Colonel, it would save
time if we could work during dinner.

633
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,964
Would it be possible
to have a meal served here?

634
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,382
Of course.

635
01:11:43,675 --> 01:11:45,258
If we...

636
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:48,387
- Carry on, Hughes.
- Yes, sir.

637
01:11:48,596 --> 01:11:52,057
If we increase the number of squads
and specialise their functions...

638
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:57,020
...I'm certain the total daily output
can be increased by 30 percent.

639
01:11:57,188 --> 01:12:00,482
Now, Colonel Saito,
I have one more point...

640
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:06,279
Now, there's another important
decision that can't be postponed.

641
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:08,865
As most of the British
will work on the bridge...

642
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:11,994
...only a small number will be available
for railway work.

643
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:17,165
I must ask you to lend us some of your
men to reinforce the railway gang...

644
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:21,962
...so the final stretch of track can
be completed as quickly as possible.

645
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:25,507
I have already given the order.

646
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:28,844
We must fix the daily work quota
for your men.

647
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:33,056
I thought of setting it at a yard
and a half so as not to overtire them...

648
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:35,976
...but isn't it best
to be the same as ours?

649
01:12:36,227 --> 01:12:39,479
That would also create a healthy
competitive spirit.

650
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:44,651
I have already given the order.

651
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:47,446
- We'll try to surpass that, won't we?
- Yes, sir.

652
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:50,657
I think that completes
the agenda for this evening.

653
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:54,327
Thank you, Colonel Saito,
for your kind attention.

654
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:57,456
And are there any other questions?

655
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:00,542
One question.

656
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:03,712
Can you finish the bridge in time?

657
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:07,466
Frankly, the consensus of opinion
is that it's impossible.

658
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:10,135
But we'll certainly give it a go.

659
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:15,682
We mustn't forget we wasted a month
through an unfortunate disagreement...

660
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:17,768
...for which I was not to blame.

661
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:21,188
Is there anything else?

662
01:13:21,773 --> 01:13:23,065
No.

663
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:27,652
Thank you. The meeting is closed.

664
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:31,406
- Good night.
- Good night.

665
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:59,976
I hope these Japanese appreciate
what we're doing for them.

666
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:03,939
For the moment, I'm not concerned
with their appreciation.

667
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:07,484
- Good night, Clipton.
- Good night, sir.

668
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:11,696
By the way, I meant to tell you...

669
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:14,783
...there are trees in this forest
very similar to elm.

670
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:18,203
And the elm piles of London Bridge
lasted 600 years.

671
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:22,290
- Six hundred years, Reeves?
- Yes, sir.

672
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:25,627
Six hundred years.

673
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:28,338
That would be quite something.

674
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:21,141
Good morning. I'm looking for an
American named Commander Shears.

675
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:24,644
- Oh, yes, down on the beach.
- Oh, thank you very much.

676
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:33,612
Kiss!

677
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,323
Too many eyes.

678
01:15:36,616 --> 01:15:40,827
You give me powders, pills, baths,
injections, enemas...

679
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:42,495
...when all I need is love.

680
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:45,498
It's true.
All you really need is love.

681
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:53,465
What makes you so sure
you'll get a medical discharge?

682
01:15:53,633 --> 01:15:55,967
Because I'm a civilian
at heart, lover.

683
01:15:56,219 --> 01:15:58,345
And I always follow my heart.

684
01:15:58,596 --> 01:15:59,888
Kiss.

685
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:10,523
How's that, commander?

686
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,235
Don't call me commander.

687
01:16:13,444 --> 01:16:14,819
It's unromantic.

688
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,821
You're an officer yourself.

689
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:19,950
How would you like it
if I called you Lieutenant Lover?

690
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:22,661
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."

691
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:23,995
Yes, sir.

692
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:27,332
Brass ahoy.

693
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:29,918
He wants to see you. He's all yours.

694
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:32,629
- I'm going for a swim.
- Don't leave me.

695
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:35,840
- Commander Shears?
- Yes.

696
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:37,842
My name's Warden.

697
01:16:38,219 --> 01:16:39,886
- How do you do?
- Sorry to intrude...

698
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:42,514
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it by now.

699
01:16:42,682 --> 01:16:43,807
Like a martini?

700
01:16:43,975 --> 01:16:45,809
That's very kind, but I think not.

701
01:16:45,977 --> 01:16:47,310
- Mind if I have one?
- No.

702
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:48,853
How did you get that?

703
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:52,023
Where there's a hospital,
there's alcohol.

704
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:55,151
Oh, yes, of course. Jolly good.

705
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:58,071
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.

706
01:16:58,364 --> 01:17:01,866
I belong to a rather rum group
called Force 316.

707
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:04,577
Our headquarters is up
in the Botanical Gardens.

708
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:08,081
- Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
- Not quite.

709
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:11,167
- Sure you won't have a martini?
- No, thanks.

710
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:15,380
We have a particular interest
in that railway you worked on.

711
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:18,925
You could give us no end
of valuable information.

712
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:22,679
Well, I'm leaving
for the States in a few days...

713
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:26,057
...and I've already told your people
everything I know.

714
01:17:26,225 --> 01:17:29,602
But you could help us
in a rather special sense.

715
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,521
I know it's a terrible imposition...

716
01:17:31,689 --> 01:17:34,983
...but I wonder if you could possibly
come out and see us.

717
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:39,362
Well, if you want to go over
the whole thing again.

718
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:42,240
Oh, that's very kind.
Lord Louis will be grateful.

719
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:43,867
- Lord who?
- Mountbatten.

720
01:17:44,035 --> 01:17:46,661
- We're one of his special pigeons.
- Oh, I see.

721
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:50,373
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8. I'll send a car for you.

722
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:52,917
This evening? Out of the question.

723
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:55,462
Well, tomorrow morning then?
About 10?

724
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:58,173
- Okay, 10:00.
- Thanks very much.

725
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:00,633
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.

726
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,093
Good luck.

727
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:04,179
Thanks.

728
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:16,107
I know, you're terribly sorry, but you're
going to stand me up tonight.

729
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:18,360
You couldn't be more wrong.

730
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:25,408
General salute!

731
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:28,078
Present arms!

732
01:18:41,175 --> 01:18:44,010
- May I see your pass, sir, please?
- Oh, yes.

733
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,262
Thank you, sir.

734
01:18:46,764 --> 01:18:48,556
Carry on, driver.

735
01:18:56,774 --> 01:18:59,150
Major Warden's bungalow
is at the end of the path.

736
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:01,111
All right, thanks.

737
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:15,083
Good show, Jenkins. Good show!

738
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:18,837
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man. Use your knife.

739
01:19:20,381 --> 01:19:24,259
Good! On your feet, chaps.
Away to the debriefing room quickly.

740
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:27,011
Come on, move yourselves!
Move! Move quickly!

741
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:33,643
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.

742
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:37,856
Always use your knife
immediately, Joyce.

743
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:40,608
You see, he's gained the initiative.

744
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:44,737
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

745
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:47,198
- You're sorry?
- So am I, sir.

746
01:19:47,408 --> 01:19:50,743
- I thought you were the enemy.
- I'm American, if that's what you mean.

747
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:54,914
- That'll be all, Joyce.
- Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

748
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:59,294
- What can I do for you, sir?
- I was on my way to see Major Warden.

749
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:03,882
I'll show you the way. He'll finish
his lecture any moment now.

750
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:13,266
- That's the end of his lecture.
- Thunderous ovation.

751
01:20:13,476 --> 01:20:17,645
He believes in keeping our training
as close to real life as possible.

752
01:20:19,899 --> 01:20:22,233
- Major Warden, sir?
- Yes?

753
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:23,902
Very good of you to come.

754
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:26,946
- I hope they took care of you.
- They certainly have.

755
01:20:27,114 --> 01:20:30,200
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.

756
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:33,286
Colonel Green is looking forward
to meeting you.

757
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:37,790
- Fascinating place, isn't it?
- Utterly charming.

758
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:40,001
Didn't realise it was
a commando school.

759
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:44,964
We're trying to discourage the use of
that word. Such a melodramatic air.

760
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:46,633
What do you do here?

761
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:49,260
Sabotage, demolition,
that line of country.

762
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:52,514
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful stuff.

763
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:55,391
That pop was made
with a lump half this size.

764
01:20:55,643 --> 01:20:59,103
It's twice as powerful as gelignite
and only half the weight. Here.

765
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:03,316
It's quite harmless
until it's detonated.

766
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:05,193
Thanks for telling me.

767
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:08,446
It's completely waterproof
and actually plastic.

768
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:11,449
See? You can do
what you like with it.

769
01:21:12,326 --> 01:21:13,952
This is my place.

770
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:20,833
Go ahead.

771
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:25,421
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.

772
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:30,134
- Would you care for one?
- No, thanks.

773
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:32,512
- A drink?
- No, thank you.

774
01:21:32,763 --> 01:21:35,848
- Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
- Very good, sir.

775
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:41,145
Do you read this?

776
01:21:41,355 --> 01:21:45,233
Oh, I taught Oriental languages
at Cambridge before the war.

777
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:52,740
I never congratulated you
on your escape. It was a good show.

778
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:56,869
I was lucky. If your sea-rescue plane
hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.

779
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:58,788
No, I suppose not.

780
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:04,669
Would you like to see
where you were?

781
01:22:05,713 --> 01:22:07,297
All right.

782
01:22:08,215 --> 01:22:11,759
Our information's rather scanty.
It's mostly based on your report.

783
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:13,803
But we think the camp is about here.

784
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:18,516
Say, do your people have any idea
what happened to Colonel Nicholson?

785
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:22,270
He had guts. They were about to
shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.

786
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:25,607
If you're about to be shot
there's not much you can do.

787
01:22:25,858 --> 01:22:30,361
Here is the River Kwai, and here is
the village where you were helped.

788
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:32,196
And here is the railway.

789
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:35,074
But then you must be fairly familiar
with all this area.

790
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:37,869
Not really, I was out of my head
half the time.

791
01:22:38,037 --> 01:22:41,706
The railway starts down here
in Singapore. Malaya...

792
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:46,794
...Bangkok, Rangoon. Their idea
is to drive on through, into India.

793
01:22:47,046 --> 01:22:50,506
- Where was I picked up?
- Oh, about here.

794
01:22:50,758 --> 01:22:55,720
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok-
Rangoon section by the middle of May.

795
01:22:55,929 --> 01:22:58,056
Naturally, we'll try to prevent them.

796
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:01,142
It's too far for bombers
to carry an adequate load.

797
01:23:01,352 --> 01:23:03,728
We'll have to go smash it
on the ground.

798
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:06,564
- How will you get there?
- Parachute drop, then march.

799
01:23:06,774 --> 01:23:09,734
With demolition equipment
through that jungle?

800
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:14,322
Our chief problem
is lack of firsthand knowledge.

801
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:17,116
You see, none of us have
ever been there.

802
01:23:17,368 --> 01:23:20,578
- I don't want to discourage...
- It should be interesting.

803
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:22,705
Colonel Green's given me
the Kwai bridge.

804
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:25,750
I'm gonna take a team in
and blow it up.

805
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:28,044
Lucky you.

806
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:32,256
Sure you won't have tea?

807
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:37,053
No, thanks. I don't want to be rude,
but I've got a luncheon date at 2.

808
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:40,973
- So if there are any questions...
- Of course, I'm sorry.

809
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:46,813
Well, there is only
one question, actually.

810
01:23:47,272 --> 01:23:49,524
How would you feel
about going back?

811
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:52,819
Come again?

812
01:23:53,987 --> 01:23:56,698
I know, under the circumstances,
it's a bit much...

813
01:23:56,907 --> 01:24:00,076
...but you have a unique
knowledge for our purpose.

814
01:24:00,327 --> 01:24:02,120
And we'd love to have you with us.

815
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:06,457
That's why you brought me here?

816
01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:08,209
To ask me this?

817
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:10,169
Well, frankly, yes.

818
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:13,631
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.

819
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:16,426
Now you want me to go back?
Don't be ridiculous!

820
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:17,927
This is embarrassing...

821
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:21,848
I can't go back! I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.

822
01:24:22,099 --> 01:24:26,018
Actually, Colonel Green has taken
the matter up with your people.

823
01:24:26,228 --> 01:24:30,064
- With my people?
- Your Navy's turned you over to us.

824
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:34,068
A signal arrived yesterday morning
from your CINC Pacific...

825
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:38,364
...authorising your temporary transfer
of duty to Force 316.

826
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:41,409
- They can't do this to me.
- I'm afraid they have.

827
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:44,495
It was difficult to know how
to break it to you.

828
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:49,167
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it. My Navy's made a mistake.

829
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:57,091
Look. I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.

830
01:24:57,384 --> 01:25:02,513
The whole thing's a fake. I'm just
an ordinary swab jockey, second class.

831
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:09,103
When the Houston sunk, I made
it ashore with a real commander.

832
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:12,523
Later on, we ran into
a Japanese patrol. He was killed.

833
01:25:12,733 --> 01:25:16,152
I figured it was just a matter of time
before I was captured...

834
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:19,197
So you changed uniforms
with a dead man.

835
01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:22,116
I thought officers would get
better treatment.

836
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:23,451
That's very sensible.

837
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:27,205
But at Saito's camp, the officers
worked along with the rest.

838
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:29,999
Yes, there's always the unexpected,
isn't there?

839
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:35,505
I kind of got used
to being a commander...

840
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:39,050
...so when I arrived here
at the hospital...

841
01:25:39,218 --> 01:25:43,387
...I took a look at the enlisted men's
ward and then the officer's ward...

842
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:48,226
...and I said to myself,
"Let's let it ride along for a while."

843
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:50,186
There were certain advantages.

844
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:52,271
I saw one of them on the beach.

845
01:25:53,190 --> 01:25:54,732
Anyway, that's the whole story.

846
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:58,903
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer...

847
01:25:59,112 --> 01:26:01,989
...an American commander
named Shears who doesn't exist.

848
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:04,408
When the Navy learns the truth,
they'll say:

849
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:07,745
"Ship him home in irons
for impersonating an officer."

850
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:11,541
- Once that happens, I've got it made.
- Got it what?

851
01:26:11,792 --> 01:26:15,002
- Made. I'd like that drink now.
- Of course.

852
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:17,755
I'll apply for a medical discharge.

853
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:20,132
I'll tell them
I impersonated an officer...

854
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,927
...because I went off my rocker
in the jungle.

855
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:28,224
I'm getting worse, you know.
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.

856
01:26:28,976 --> 01:26:30,685
It's quite a clever plan.

857
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:34,021
It's not only clever, it's foolproof.

858
01:26:34,273 --> 01:26:36,607
If my Navy finds out who I am...

859
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:40,862
...those temporary orders won't be
worth the paper they're written on.

860
01:26:54,585 --> 01:26:56,460
This is your photograph, isn't it?

861
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:02,174
- Where did you get this?
- It took a bit of doing...

862
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:04,844
...because your people
couldn't identify you.

863
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:09,891
Finally your CINC Pacific
sent us a copy of your service record.

864
01:27:10,142 --> 01:27:14,145
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?

865
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:15,980
No.

866
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:20,484
You see, we've known about
your actual rank for nearly a week.

867
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:25,990
Your Navy's in an awkward position.

868
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:28,409
In one sense you're a blasted hero...

869
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:31,329
...for making an escape
from the jungle.

870
01:27:31,538 --> 01:27:34,498
But at the same time,
they can't bring you home...

871
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:38,210
...and give you the Navy Cross
for impersonating an officer.

872
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:41,797
I suppose that's why they were
so happy to hand you over to us.

873
01:27:42,049 --> 01:27:43,633
You see?

874
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:45,009
Hot potato.

875
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:48,220
As far as your present rank
is concerned...

876
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:51,599
...we're fairly informal
about those things in Force 316.

877
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:54,226
You'd have the simulated
rank of major.

878
01:27:55,604 --> 01:27:59,273
Simulated major. That figures.

879
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:02,193
Well...

880
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:08,824
As long as I'm hooked,
I might as well volunteer.

881
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:11,035
Good show!

882
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:14,205
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.

883
01:28:14,456 --> 01:28:19,752
This is Major Shears. He volunteered
to go and help me blow up the bridge.

884
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,379
Really?

885
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:24,131
Good show!

886
01:28:24,383 --> 01:28:27,218
Jolly good show, major!

887
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:19,437
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
This foot's infected.

888
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:21,814
The colonel might think
I'm malingering.

889
01:29:21,982 --> 01:29:24,775
I'm the medical officer, Baker.
Get cracking.

890
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:34,452
Will someone tell me why the old man
wants us to build a proper bridge?

891
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:38,122
Don't you worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.

892
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:52,720
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.

893
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:55,556
Fine job our chaps are doing.
First-rate.

894
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:58,142
Yes. How's he behaving?

895
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:01,145
He's been most reasonable
since we took over.

896
01:30:01,354 --> 01:30:04,231
- I wonder what he's thinking.
- I haven't the foggiest.

897
01:30:04,483 --> 01:30:06,484
- Thanks, Reeves.
- Right, sir.

898
01:30:07,194 --> 01:30:08,569
What do you think?

899
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:12,156
Quite a challenge, isn't it?

900
01:30:14,284 --> 01:30:18,662
Sir, are you convinced that
building this bridge is a good idea?

901
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:20,539
- Are you serious?
- Yes, sir.

902
01:30:20,707 --> 01:30:24,418
A good idea? Take another look.

903
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:29,256
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?

904
01:30:29,508 --> 01:30:31,550
Their condition has been improved?

905
01:30:31,718 --> 01:30:34,428
- Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
- Yes, sir, but...

906
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:37,264
They feed better
and they are no longer abused.

907
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:39,016
- That's all true.
- Well, then.

908
01:30:39,184 --> 01:30:42,520
Honestly, Clipton, there are times
when I don't understand you at all.

909
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,647
I'll try to make myself clear, sir.

910
01:30:44,815 --> 01:30:48,692
The fact is, what we're doing
could be construed as...

911
01:30:48,902 --> 01:30:51,946
...forgive me, sir,
collaboration with the enemy.

912
01:30:52,114 --> 01:30:53,864
Perhaps even as
treasonable activity.

913
01:30:54,032 --> 01:30:58,119
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.

914
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:01,580
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?

915
01:31:01,748 --> 01:31:05,334
Must we build them a better bridge
than they could have themselves?

916
01:31:05,919 --> 01:31:10,297
If you had to operate on Saito,
would you do your best or let him die?

917
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:14,176
Would you prefer
we disintegrate in idleness?

918
01:31:14,344 --> 01:31:17,221
Would you have it said that
our chaps can't do a proper job?

919
01:31:17,389 --> 01:31:22,393
It's important to show these people
they can't break us in body or in spirit.

920
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:24,895
Take a good look, Clipton.

921
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:27,815
One day the war will be over.

922
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:31,402
I hope that the people who use
this bridge in years to come...

923
01:31:31,570 --> 01:31:34,738
...will remember how it was built,
and who built it.

924
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:40,327
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.

925
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:42,872
- Yes, sir.
- You're a fine doctor...

926
01:31:43,123 --> 01:31:45,958
...but you've a lot to learn
about the army.

927
01:32:09,691 --> 01:32:11,275
Hold him! Hold him!

928
01:32:11,484 --> 01:32:15,571
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?

929
01:32:22,787 --> 01:32:24,330
Good morning.

930
01:32:38,053 --> 01:32:40,429
What on earth
are you people staring at?

931
01:32:40,597 --> 01:32:42,723
Get on with your jobs!

932
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:45,809
Now get him with your boot!

933
01:32:58,406 --> 01:32:59,949
I'm awfully sorry I'm late, sir.

934
01:33:00,116 --> 01:33:03,994
Four minutes late, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?

935
01:33:04,162 --> 01:33:06,872
- Sir?
- I was referring to the nurse.

936
01:33:07,707 --> 01:33:10,542
Oh, yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.

937
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:12,086
Sit down.

938
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:17,132
I asked you here to help us pick
the fourth member of your team.

939
01:33:17,384 --> 01:33:20,052
- Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
- Yes, sir.

940
01:33:20,637 --> 01:33:23,472
Chapman here wants Joyce,
but I have my doubts about him.

941
01:33:23,723 --> 01:33:27,518
I think he has too much imagination
as distinct from cold calculation.

942
01:33:27,686 --> 01:33:28,936
As I've told you before...

943
01:33:29,104 --> 01:33:33,482
...in this job, even when it's finished
there's always one more thing to do.

944
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:36,110
He's the best swimmer
in the school, sir.

945
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:40,656
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.

946
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:46,078
All right, at ease.

947
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:54,503
These gentlemen are thinking of
taking you for a hike into the jungle.

948
01:33:54,754 --> 01:33:56,088
Yes, sir.

949
01:33:56,756 --> 01:33:59,008
You were an accountant in Montreal?

950
01:33:59,259 --> 01:34:01,427
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.

951
01:34:01,678 --> 01:34:03,804
That is, I didn't have my charter.

952
01:34:04,014 --> 01:34:05,431
Exactly what did you do?

953
01:34:05,682 --> 01:34:09,643
Well, sir, I just checked columns
and columns of figures...

954
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:12,396
...which people had checked
before me...

955
01:34:12,564 --> 01:34:16,025
...and then other people checked them
after I had checked them.

956
01:34:16,276 --> 01:34:19,528
- Sounds a frightful bore.
- Sir, it was a frightful bore.

957
01:34:19,696 --> 01:34:21,363
How did you happen
to wind up here?

958
01:34:21,531 --> 01:34:24,074
In '39 I came over to London
to enlist.

959
01:34:24,242 --> 01:34:26,785
About two years later
I volunteered for this work.

960
01:34:26,953 --> 01:34:30,664
- You volunteered!
- Yes, sir. See, the regular army...

961
01:34:30,915 --> 01:34:32,541
Go ahead, you can be frank.

962
01:34:32,959 --> 01:34:38,047
Well, the regular army reminded me
of my job in civilian life.

963
01:34:38,298 --> 01:34:40,507
They don't expect you to think.

964
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:44,470
Think about this.

965
01:34:44,763 --> 01:34:47,723
Are you quite sure you'd be able
to use it in cold blood?

966
01:34:48,183 --> 01:34:49,475
I know how to use it, sir.

967
01:34:49,726 --> 01:34:53,729
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?

968
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:56,357
Could you kill without hesitation?

969
01:34:57,442 --> 01:35:02,529
That's a question I've often asked
myself, sir. It's worried me quite a bit.

970
01:35:02,989 --> 01:35:04,698
And what was the answer?

971
01:35:05,116 --> 01:35:07,201
I don't honestly know, sir.

972
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:10,537
I've tried to imagine myself...

973
01:35:12,374 --> 01:35:16,377
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself
that killing isn't a crime.

974
01:35:17,087 --> 01:35:19,046
It's an old army problem.

975
01:35:19,672 --> 01:35:22,841
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.

976
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:26,887
Am I to go with the team, sir?

977
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:29,681
We'll let you know.

978
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:38,482
You see what I mean.

979
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:40,609
Well, at least he was honest.

980
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:45,364
None of us ever know the answer to
that question until the moment arises.

981
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:47,157
What's your opinion, Shears?

982
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:50,077
Well, sir, he's Canadian.

983
01:35:50,286 --> 01:35:54,498
And that's in keeping with the
international composition of this outfit.

984
01:35:54,833 --> 01:35:57,167
If he wants to go,
he can even take my place.

985
01:35:58,002 --> 01:36:01,505
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce,
he's yours.

986
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:05,259
I had a report from air reconnaissance
on that village.

987
01:36:05,427 --> 01:36:08,429
There's sufficient clearing
to make your jump at last light.

988
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:11,890
- You've had parachute training?
- No, sir.

989
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:14,810
Blast. This is awkward.

990
01:36:15,061 --> 01:36:17,271
Silly, it never occurred to me.

991
01:36:17,814 --> 01:36:18,897
Well, maybe...

992
01:36:19,149 --> 01:36:22,067
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.

993
01:36:22,318 --> 01:36:24,194
I'll pop over
and check right away.

994
01:36:24,446 --> 01:36:27,531
- All right, Chapman, you can run along.
- Yes, sir.

995
01:36:29,826 --> 01:36:32,119
Well, feel like a sniff of air?

996
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:33,745
Yes, sir.

997
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:36,665
You don't realise what a plum
you are for us.

998
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:40,419
Your knowledge of the area,
making friends in that village.

999
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:44,798
It's almost as if your whole escape
had been planned with us in mind.

1000
01:36:47,594 --> 01:36:52,097
By the way, here's something
that'll interest you. The new L pill.

1001
01:36:53,141 --> 01:36:56,685
- L pill?
- L for lethal. Instantaneous, painless.

1002
01:36:56,895 --> 01:37:00,230
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.

1003
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:02,983
You're telling me
not to be taken alive.

1004
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:05,068
I wouldn't recommend it.

1005
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:09,740
If any of you get hurt or wounded the
others will have to leave him behind.

1006
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:12,326
The objective comes first
in our work.

1007
01:37:12,994 --> 01:37:15,370
You want my honest evaluation
of this team?

1008
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:17,664
I didn't want to speak out
in front of them.

1009
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:19,625
I understand, go ahead.

1010
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:24,338
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.

1011
01:37:24,589 --> 01:37:27,341
Joyce is... He'll be okay.

1012
01:37:27,592 --> 01:37:30,260
- It's Warden I don't get.
- Oh, why not?

1013
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:32,221
Cambridge don and all of that.

1014
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:36,016
It's one thing to play with explosives
like a kid with firecrackers...

1015
01:37:36,267 --> 01:37:38,602
He's not without experience,
you know.

1016
01:37:39,479 --> 01:37:43,440
When we lost Singapore, he stayed
behind to blow up a couple of bridges.

1017
01:37:43,608 --> 01:37:46,401
And many other installations
before the Japs caught him.

1018
01:37:46,611 --> 01:37:47,611
- Caught him?
- Yes.

1019
01:37:47,779 --> 01:37:50,697
- Fascinating story. He...
- Sir, it's most annoying.

1020
01:37:50,949 --> 01:37:55,494
In view of time, they don't think
practice jumps would be worthwhile.

1021
01:37:55,662 --> 01:37:57,371
- No?
- If you make one jump...

1022
01:37:57,539 --> 01:37:59,790
...you've only got 50 percent
chance of injury.

1023
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:03,544
Two jumps, 80 percent. Three jumps,
you're bound to get your packet.

1024
01:38:03,795 --> 01:38:07,714
The consensus is, the most sensible
thing for Major Shears to do...

1025
01:38:07,924 --> 01:38:10,926
...is to go ahead and jump
and hope for the best.

1026
01:38:11,177 --> 01:38:13,220
With or without parachute?

1027
01:38:18,309 --> 01:38:20,519
Oh, very good!

1028
01:38:24,148 --> 01:38:25,732
With or without!

1029
01:39:22,915 --> 01:39:23,957
He's in the trees!

1030
01:40:02,955 --> 01:40:05,624
Yai says we can't reach
the Kwai by the route you took.

1031
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:10,253
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.

1032
01:40:10,421 --> 01:40:12,631
- Who's gonna lead the way?
- Yai himself.

1033
01:40:12,799 --> 01:40:15,342
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.

1034
01:40:15,593 --> 01:40:18,345
Which means we shall have to
use women bearers.

1035
01:40:18,513 --> 01:40:21,056
- Women bearers.
- They're very capable, I'm told.

1036
01:40:32,568 --> 01:40:35,654
He says it's dangerous
to spend the night in the village.

1037
01:40:35,905 --> 01:40:40,075
There's an enemy post three miles away
so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.

1038
01:40:40,326 --> 01:40:45,038
- What about Chapman?
- Yai will bury him and his chute.

1039
01:40:45,289 --> 01:40:46,915
Is there something wrong?

1040
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:52,796
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language. I don't.

1041
01:40:53,047 --> 01:40:57,050
He's gonna lead you back to the river
by a route I never took.

1042
01:40:57,301 --> 01:41:00,929
Will someone tell me why
I'm so indispensable to this outfit?

1043
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:05,475
I know how you feel, but there's
always the unexpected, isn't there?

1044
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:07,811
Tell that to Chapman.

1045
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:09,646
Let's get cracking.

1046
01:44:13,581 --> 01:44:15,248
You're lovely.

1047
01:44:17,793 --> 01:44:19,044
Lovely.

1048
01:44:19,295 --> 01:44:21,504
Be happy in your work.

1049
01:44:21,797 --> 01:44:23,006
Yes, sir.

1050
01:44:50,368 --> 01:44:51,743
Leeches.

1051
01:44:52,328 --> 01:44:53,828
Leeches.

1052
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:13,223
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.

1053
01:45:13,391 --> 01:45:16,017
What's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?

1054
01:45:16,185 --> 01:45:18,687
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.

1055
01:45:18,938 --> 01:45:22,440
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.

1056
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:24,192
What's wrong with that thing?

1057
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:28,029
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.

1058
01:45:28,197 --> 01:45:29,531
I'll tell you what's wrong.

1059
01:45:29,699 --> 01:45:33,660
It's wet, mildewed, corroded, rotten.
Like everything else in this jungle.

1060
01:45:33,828 --> 01:45:35,578
You might as well dump it!

1061
01:45:40,626 --> 01:45:42,836
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.

1062
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:47,590
This is your friendliest enemy
reminding you to take it easy...

1063
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:50,343
...and never volunteer for anything.

1064
01:46:03,524 --> 01:46:05,608
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.

1065
01:46:05,776 --> 01:46:08,111
- I've got it all decoded, sir.
- Read it.

1066
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:12,157
Yes, sir. "One, original
bridge works reported abandoned.

1067
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:14,993
New construction downstream
from first site.

1068
01:46:15,244 --> 01:46:19,330
Two, enemy intends to open railway
with passage of special train...

1069
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:22,500
...Bangkok for Rangoon
with troops and V.I.P.

1070
01:46:22,752 --> 01:46:25,378
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.

1071
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:28,757
Three, synchronize demolition
with passage this train.

1072
01:46:28,924 --> 01:46:32,135
Four, good hunting. Have fun."
That's all, sir.

1073
01:46:32,386 --> 01:46:34,095
A train and a bridge!

1074
01:46:34,263 --> 01:46:36,681
Yes, sir.
Can we get there in time, sir?

1075
01:46:36,849 --> 01:46:39,434
Yai says we're two to three days'
march from the Kwai.

1076
01:46:39,643 --> 01:46:43,646
If we set a faster pace, we could
make it before sundown on the 12th.

1077
01:46:43,898 --> 01:46:45,815
It's worth it for the train.

1078
01:46:46,067 --> 01:46:49,360
Oh, by all means. Good hunting.
Good show.

1079
01:46:49,570 --> 01:46:51,571
Jolly good fun. Jolly, jolly good.

1080
01:46:52,698 --> 01:46:56,159
If you hadn't fixed the radio,
we wouldn't know about the train.

1081
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:59,162
Well, there's always the unexpected,
isn't there?

1082
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:04,042
Heave!

1083
01:47:04,210 --> 01:47:07,921
Heave! Heave!

1084
01:47:24,313 --> 01:47:26,815
- Half a pint, sir.
- Quinine.

1085
01:47:28,526 --> 01:47:31,194
Well, we'll complete this later.

1086
01:47:32,071 --> 01:47:35,573
- Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
- Yes, sir?

1087
01:47:36,575 --> 01:47:40,703
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We won't finish the bridge on time.

1088
01:47:40,871 --> 01:47:42,497
We just haven't the manpower.

1089
01:47:42,706 --> 01:47:46,000
I've asked the officers to lend a hand,
but even that won't do it.

1090
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:47,836
The officers are going to work?

1091
01:47:48,087 --> 01:47:51,840
I explained the situation and they
volunteered, but it's not enough.

1092
01:47:52,007 --> 01:47:53,842
Why not ask Saito
for some of his men?

1093
01:47:54,009 --> 01:47:57,178
This is our show. We must
make the most of our resources.

1094
01:47:57,346 --> 01:48:00,223
That's what I came to talk
to you about. The sick list.

1095
01:48:00,474 --> 01:48:04,185
There's not a man in this hospital
who doesn't belong there.

1096
01:48:04,353 --> 01:48:06,813
Don't jump to conclusions.
No reflection on you...

1097
01:48:06,981 --> 01:48:09,232
...but there are always
a few malingerers.

1098
01:48:09,441 --> 01:48:11,860
Be honest. Keep an open mind
is all I ask.

1099
01:48:12,111 --> 01:48:13,945
Come along, let's see.

1100
01:48:15,406 --> 01:48:17,282
Don't move, don't move.

1101
01:48:21,078 --> 01:48:22,745
What's the matter with Haskins?

1102
01:48:22,913 --> 01:48:26,624
He's got amoebic dysentery and
blackwater fever. Temperature of 104.

1103
01:48:26,792 --> 01:48:28,334
Right. I see.

1104
01:48:31,422 --> 01:48:32,630
And this man?

1105
01:48:32,882 --> 01:48:36,843
Leg ulcers. I may be able to save
the leg if I do more cutting tonight.

1106
01:48:37,011 --> 01:48:39,053
Really want to send him
out to work, sir?

1107
01:48:39,263 --> 01:48:41,055
Don't talk rot, Clipton.

1108
01:48:45,436 --> 01:48:48,062
- And that man there?
- His arm's infected.

1109
01:48:48,272 --> 01:48:50,565
Most of their wounds
won't heal properly.

1110
01:48:50,774 --> 01:48:53,484
I wonder, in his case,
if fresh air and light duties...

1111
01:48:53,652 --> 01:48:55,778
...might do more good
than being cooped up.

1112
01:48:55,946 --> 01:48:58,948
- Light duties?
- It's not our policy to keep a man...

1113
01:48:59,116 --> 01:49:01,743
- ...just because he scratched his arm.
- Not our policy?

1114
01:49:01,911 --> 01:49:03,161
Well, is it?

1115
01:49:03,329 --> 01:49:07,373
A man may not be on top of his form,
but he can still make himself useful.

1116
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:11,211
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.

1117
01:49:11,462 --> 01:49:15,048
Tell me, you feel up to doing
a little light work on the bridge?

1118
01:49:16,675 --> 01:49:19,219
- Anything you say, sir.
- Good show.

1119
01:49:20,304 --> 01:49:22,013
What about you? Nothing difficult.

1120
01:49:22,181 --> 01:49:24,641
- I'll try, sir.
- Good man.

1121
01:49:26,393 --> 01:49:31,189
Now, look here, men. It goes
without saying I'm proud of all of you.

1122
01:49:31,357 --> 01:49:35,944
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it...

1123
01:49:36,195 --> 01:49:40,323
...how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?

1124
01:49:40,532 --> 01:49:41,950
What do you say?

1125
01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:45,828
- Yes, sir.
- Good show. Come on, follow me.

1126
01:51:28,349 --> 01:51:29,432
Ten minutes.

1127
01:53:27,426 --> 01:53:29,302
Make sure they're all dead.

1128
01:53:32,764 --> 01:53:34,140
Come on, Joyce.

1129
01:53:36,351 --> 01:53:38,978
Use your knife, man,
or we'll be shooting each other.

1130
01:53:51,283 --> 01:53:52,950
Go that way, Joyce.

1131
01:56:01,371 --> 01:56:04,206
I could have done it. I was ready.

1132
01:56:08,712 --> 01:56:10,087
Are you hit, sir?

1133
01:56:10,464 --> 01:56:11,756
Let's go.

1134
01:56:33,111 --> 01:56:36,864
It's superficial. Maybe a chipped bone,
but there's nothing broken.

1135
01:56:37,032 --> 01:56:39,200
- It's my fault, sir.
- Oh, shut up, Joyce.

1136
01:56:39,368 --> 01:56:41,786
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.

1137
01:56:41,953 --> 01:56:43,913
Yeah, but how far and how fast?

1138
01:56:44,122 --> 01:56:46,791
We won't know that
till I've tried it, will we?

1139
01:59:59,276 --> 02:00:00,943
What are you doing?

1140
02:00:01,444 --> 02:00:03,487
I didn't give orders for a halt.

1141
02:00:03,697 --> 02:00:05,155
We all need it.

1142
02:00:09,244 --> 02:00:12,788
We're still five hours' fast march
from the objective.

1143
02:00:12,998 --> 02:00:14,331
Maybe six.

1144
02:00:15,375 --> 02:00:16,542
Come on.

1145
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:19,295
You keep walking on that foot,
you'll bleed to death.

1146
02:00:20,672 --> 02:00:22,214
Yeah.

1147
02:00:26,887 --> 02:00:29,972
- You're gonna leave me here.
- If you stop, we stop.

1148
02:00:30,849 --> 02:00:33,475
You can't study the layout
of the bridge after dark.

1149
02:00:33,685 --> 02:00:35,811
You've got to get there
before sundown.

1150
02:00:36,021 --> 02:00:40,691
But, sir, when the job's done, who
knows if we can return by this route...

1151
02:00:40,984 --> 02:00:43,068
...or whether we could find you
if we did?

1152
02:00:43,320 --> 02:00:46,864
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate
to leave you and you know that.

1153
02:00:47,115 --> 02:00:48,616
He doesn't know it, but I do.

1154
02:00:48,783 --> 02:00:52,244
You'd leave your own mother here
if the rules called for it.

1155
02:00:52,996 --> 02:00:56,415
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.

1156
02:00:56,625 --> 02:00:58,918
You're in command now, Shears.

1157
02:01:01,671 --> 02:01:03,505
I won't obey that order.

1158
02:01:03,882 --> 02:01:05,633
You make me sick with your heroics.

1159
02:01:05,842 --> 02:01:08,636
You carry the stench of death
like the plague.

1160
02:01:08,887 --> 02:01:11,096
Explosives and L pills
go well together.

1161
02:01:11,348 --> 02:01:15,017
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.

1162
02:01:15,268 --> 02:01:17,019
This is just a game, this war.

1163
02:01:17,228 --> 02:01:21,148
You and that Colonel Nicholson,
you're crazy with courage. For what?

1164
02:01:21,399 --> 02:01:24,360
How to die like a gentleman,
how to die by the rules...

1165
02:01:24,569 --> 02:01:28,322
...when the only important thing
is how to live like a human being!

1166
02:01:32,327 --> 02:01:35,204
I'm not gonna leave you
here to die, Warden...

1167
02:01:36,539 --> 02:01:40,417
...because I don't care about
your bridge or about your rules.

1168
02:01:40,877 --> 02:01:43,545
If we go on, we go on together.

1169
02:01:46,466 --> 02:01:48,133
Good old Yai.

1170
02:02:00,105 --> 02:02:01,271
I'm all right.

1171
02:02:11,950 --> 02:02:13,242
Come on.

1172
02:03:02,751 --> 02:03:04,209
Let's get closer.

1173
02:03:23,730 --> 02:03:25,939
Still sorry we brought you along?

1174
02:03:27,650 --> 02:03:29,526
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.

1175
02:03:29,736 --> 02:03:31,987
You're in command again now,
you know.

1176
02:03:32,197 --> 02:03:33,864
Thank you, major.

1177
02:03:34,741 --> 02:03:39,745
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.

1178
02:03:42,332 --> 02:03:45,334
Not like the bridges
the enemy usually throws together.

1179
02:03:45,668 --> 02:03:46,919
Look.

1180
02:03:48,755 --> 02:03:50,798
Those poor devils down there.

1181
02:03:51,049 --> 02:03:54,885
Imagine being forced to build that
in the condition they must be in.

1182
02:03:56,012 --> 02:03:59,014
They've got a British officer
working on his knees.

1183
02:03:59,265 --> 02:04:01,350
The Japanese seem
to be enjoying it too.

1184
02:04:02,519 --> 02:04:05,687
If he knew we were here,
it might boost his morale a little.

1185
02:04:24,833 --> 02:04:28,210
If not for the train, we could
set a time fuse and be miles away.

1186
02:04:28,419 --> 02:04:31,255
Since we don't know
what time it'll cross tomorrow...

1187
02:04:31,506 --> 02:04:33,757
...we'll have to do the job manually.

1188
02:04:34,384 --> 02:04:37,136
We'll set the charges
against the piles...

1189
02:04:37,387 --> 02:04:40,889
...about three feet under the water,
I should think...

1190
02:04:41,141 --> 02:04:44,476
...and run the main wire
downstream to the plunger.

1191
02:04:45,728 --> 02:04:48,564
The problem is where to hide it.

1192
02:04:53,653 --> 02:04:56,780
Our side of the river is quite
obviously used by the Japanese.

1193
02:04:57,115 --> 02:04:58,991
They'd spot it at once.

1194
02:05:02,829 --> 02:05:05,998
Look. Do you see
those fallen tree trunks?

1195
02:05:06,166 --> 02:05:09,543
And the grey rock just below them
on that little beach?

1196
02:05:10,128 --> 02:05:13,630
- Yes, sir, I see them.
- That's our key position.

1197
02:05:14,465 --> 02:05:16,341
It's on the wrong side of the river...

1198
02:05:16,509 --> 02:05:20,095
...but it's the only hiding place
within feasible distance.

1199
02:05:21,556 --> 02:05:23,640
As soon as the bridge goes up...

1200
02:05:24,100 --> 02:05:26,977
...whoever's there
will have to swim back.

1201
02:05:27,187 --> 02:05:29,229
It's not likely to be a pleasant swim.

1202
02:05:29,397 --> 02:05:31,982
Sir, I was the best swimmer
in my course.

1203
02:05:32,150 --> 02:05:33,692
Yeah.

1204
02:05:34,861 --> 02:05:37,112
It looks like
your line of country, then.

1205
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:38,322
Thank you, sir.

1206
02:05:38,489 --> 02:05:42,326
Shears, pick a spot on our side
of the bank where you can cover Joyce.

1207
02:05:42,577 --> 02:05:45,495
Yai will be with you
so you can occupy the Nips...

1208
02:05:45,705 --> 02:05:47,956
- ...if they make any trouble for Joyce.
- Right.

1209
02:05:48,124 --> 02:05:50,667
On the theory that
there's always one more thing...

1210
02:05:50,835 --> 02:05:55,297
...I'll set up the mortar here
to create an additional diversion.

1211
02:05:55,506 --> 02:05:58,884
Perhaps I might even take
a few potshots at the train.

1212
02:05:59,135 --> 02:06:00,385
All clear?

1213
02:06:00,637 --> 02:06:03,931
Any questions?
Right, we'll start as soon as it's dark.

1214
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:06,975
They're sure to have
sentries on the bridge...

1215
02:06:07,185 --> 02:06:11,021
...so you'll have to float
the stuff down from upriver...

1216
02:06:11,314 --> 02:06:13,023
...which means building a raft.

1217
02:06:13,191 --> 02:06:14,358
Yai.

1218
02:06:19,197 --> 02:06:21,740
Yai will take three women
to help you build the raft.

1219
02:06:21,908 --> 02:06:25,160
One will stay here with me.
All right, now get cracking.

1220
02:06:27,914 --> 02:06:29,498
Shears.

1221
02:06:30,208 --> 02:06:33,669
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle,
I'd take Joyce's assignment.

1222
02:06:33,836 --> 02:06:35,170
I know.

1223
02:06:35,338 --> 02:06:37,256
You think he'll be all right?

1224
02:06:37,548 --> 02:06:39,967
I think so. Want me to handle it?

1225
02:06:40,551 --> 02:06:43,512
I'd let you stay up here
with the mortar if I could.

1226
02:06:43,930 --> 02:06:45,389
I'm sorry.

1227
02:06:46,099 --> 02:06:48,767
When it's over, I hope you get
that medical discharge...

1228
02:06:48,935 --> 02:06:50,727
...and not the hard way.

1229
02:06:50,895 --> 02:06:52,271
Thanks.

1230
02:07:30,268 --> 02:07:31,476
Load.

1231
02:08:37,293 --> 02:08:38,585
Beautiful.

1232
02:08:39,337 --> 02:08:41,004
Yes, beautiful.

1233
02:08:41,297 --> 02:08:43,090
A first-rate job.

1234
02:08:43,549 --> 02:08:46,009
I had no idea it would
turn out so well.

1235
02:08:49,472 --> 02:08:51,139
Yes.

1236
02:08:51,391 --> 02:08:53,725
A beautiful creation.

1237
02:08:54,977 --> 02:08:56,478
I've been thinking.

1238
02:08:57,480 --> 02:09:02,067
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to
the day that I've been in the service.

1239
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:04,986
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.

1240
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:09,991
I haven't been at home more
than 10 months in all that time.

1241
02:09:10,576 --> 02:09:12,911
Still, it's been a good life.

1242
02:09:14,247 --> 02:09:16,373
I love India.

1243
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,210
I wouldn't have had it any other way.

1244
02:09:21,879 --> 02:09:23,588
But there are times...

1245
02:09:25,258 --> 02:09:29,594
...when suddenly you realise you are
nearer the end than the beginning.

1246
02:09:30,596 --> 02:09:32,139
And you wonder...

1247
02:09:33,808 --> 02:09:35,851
You ask yourself...

1248
02:09:37,186 --> 02:09:40,439
...what the sum total
of your life represents...

1249
02:09:41,232 --> 02:09:44,818
...what difference your being there
at any time made to anything...

1250
02:09:45,319 --> 02:09:47,946
...or if it made any difference
at all, really.

1251
02:09:49,574 --> 02:09:52,951
Particularly in comparison
with other men's careers.

1252
02:09:53,536 --> 02:09:56,121
I don't know whether that
kind of thinking's healthy...

1253
02:09:56,706 --> 02:10:00,292
...but I must admit I've had
some thoughts on those lines...

1254
02:10:00,460 --> 02:10:02,752
...from time to time.

1255
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:07,549
But tonight...

1256
02:10:09,051 --> 02:10:10,051
Tonight...

1257
02:10:13,806 --> 02:10:15,265
Blast.

1258
02:10:22,190 --> 02:10:23,648
I must be off.

1259
02:10:26,486 --> 02:10:29,863
The men are preparing
some sort of entertainment.

1260
02:11:16,744 --> 02:11:18,036
Lovely.

1261
02:18:30,219 --> 02:18:32,053
I'm sure I speak for all of us...

1262
02:18:32,262 --> 02:18:35,348
...when I say this has been
a most enjoyable evening.

1263
02:18:37,101 --> 02:18:39,352
As you know,
most of you move on tomorrow...

1264
02:18:39,561 --> 02:18:42,230
...to a new camp
and new construction.

1265
02:18:42,690 --> 02:18:47,026
It's a pity you won't be here to see
the first practical use of this bridge.

1266
02:18:47,194 --> 02:18:50,029
However, you'll be glad to know
that the completion...

1267
02:18:50,197 --> 02:18:52,407
...of this link in the railway...

1268
02:18:52,616 --> 02:18:55,994
...will enable us to transport
the sick and disabled...

1269
02:18:56,245 --> 02:18:59,330
...to the new camp by train.

1270
02:19:00,958 --> 02:19:03,918
Colonel Saito has kindly
permitted me to stay behind...

1271
02:19:04,128 --> 02:19:06,462
...with Major Clipton
and the sick men...

1272
02:19:06,714 --> 02:19:10,216
...and we'll rejoin you
in a few days' time.

1273
02:19:12,261 --> 02:19:15,430
Now that your work here
is finished...

1274
02:19:15,639 --> 02:19:19,684
...I suppose many of you
feel somewhat let down.

1275
02:19:20,477 --> 02:19:22,478
That's quite understandable.

1276
02:19:22,771 --> 02:19:25,398
It's a very natural reaction.

1277
02:19:27,776 --> 02:19:31,029
But one day, in a week,
a month, a year...

1278
02:19:31,238 --> 02:19:35,116
...on that day when, God willing,
we all return to our homes again...

1279
02:19:35,784 --> 02:19:40,997
...you're going to feel very proud
of what you have achieved here...

1280
02:19:41,165 --> 02:19:43,958
...in the face of great adversity.

1281
02:19:45,169 --> 02:19:47,295
What you have done should be...

1282
02:19:48,172 --> 02:19:50,006
...and I think will be...

1283
02:19:50,382 --> 02:19:55,011
...an example to all our countrymen,
soldier and civilian alike.

1284
02:19:56,221 --> 02:19:58,765
You have survived with honour.

1285
02:19:59,683 --> 02:20:01,476
That, and more.

1286
02:20:03,145 --> 02:20:05,229
Here in the wilderness...

1287
02:20:05,522 --> 02:20:08,983
...you have turned defeat
into victory.

1288
02:20:11,737 --> 02:20:13,780
I congratulate you.

1289
02:20:14,323 --> 02:20:15,364
Well done.

1290
02:20:20,746 --> 02:20:22,038
To the king.

1291
02:23:04,409 --> 02:23:05,868
And you're in business.

1292
02:23:06,078 --> 02:23:09,914
Now, you got everything? Sten,
ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.

1293
02:23:10,082 --> 02:23:11,582
Yes.

1294
02:23:11,875 --> 02:23:14,168
I'll be directly across the river.

1295
02:23:15,629 --> 02:23:18,547
The professor says there's
always one more thing to do.

1296
02:23:19,258 --> 02:23:21,467
I can't think of what it could be.

1297
02:23:22,886 --> 02:23:25,429
Except to wish you
a long and happy life.

1298
02:23:25,847 --> 02:23:27,390
Thank you.

1299
02:25:42,651 --> 02:25:44,110
What's happened?

1300
02:25:49,282 --> 02:25:51,033
The river's gone down.

1301
02:26:13,265 --> 02:26:15,182
You can see the wire.

1302
02:26:16,017 --> 02:26:17,309
The charges!

1303
02:28:25,647 --> 02:28:28,023
Don't wait for the train.

1304
02:28:28,316 --> 02:28:29,400
Do it now!

1305
02:28:56,970 --> 02:29:00,806
If Saito is correct, the train
should be along in five or 10 minutes.

1306
02:29:01,057 --> 02:29:03,809
If you don't mind,
I'll watch from up on the hill.

1307
02:29:03,977 --> 02:29:06,145
Why? You'll get a better view
from the bridge.

1308
02:29:06,313 --> 02:29:09,732
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.

1309
02:29:09,983 --> 02:29:14,403
As you please. Honestly, sometimes
I don't understand you at all.

1310
02:29:14,571 --> 02:29:18,907
Well, as you once said, sir,
I've got a lot to learn about the army.

1311
02:29:25,874 --> 02:29:27,249
Good morning.

1312
02:29:27,500 --> 02:29:29,752
River's gone down in the night.

1313
02:31:14,482 --> 02:31:15,649
What's he doing?

1314
02:32:02,447 --> 02:32:05,574
Colonel, there's something
rather odd going on.

1315
02:32:05,867 --> 02:32:09,495
I think we better have a look around
before that train comes across.

1316
02:33:08,346 --> 02:33:09,763
He's gone mad.

1317
02:33:09,973 --> 02:33:12,057
He's leading him right to it.

1318
02:33:12,308 --> 02:33:13,725
Our own man!

1319
02:33:57,979 --> 02:34:00,856
I was right.
There is something going on.

1320
02:34:56,037 --> 02:34:59,331
You've got to do it, boy.
You've got to do it now.

1321
02:35:02,168 --> 02:35:06,171
Colonel, have you a knife? I've just
realised the bridge has been mined.

1322
02:35:06,339 --> 02:35:07,798
Mined?

1323
02:35:14,681 --> 02:35:15,764
Good boy!

1324
02:35:20,728 --> 02:35:23,647
Officer, sir. British officer.
Here to blow up the bridge.

1325
02:35:23,815 --> 02:35:27,859
- Blow up the bridge?
- Yes, sir. British commando orders.

1326
02:35:28,069 --> 02:35:30,779
- Blow up the bridge?
- Yes, sir. There's no time!

1327
02:35:30,947 --> 02:35:33,407
No, no! Help!

1328
02:35:38,079 --> 02:35:39,955
Help!

1329
02:35:40,665 --> 02:35:42,958
Kill him! Kill him!

1330
02:35:43,334 --> 02:35:45,794
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand, sir!

1331
02:35:46,838 --> 02:35:49,715
Kill him! Kill him!

1332
02:35:54,637 --> 02:35:56,388
Help!

1333
02:36:00,018 --> 02:36:02,144
Kill him, Joyce! Kill him!

1334
02:36:55,281 --> 02:36:56,323
You!

1335
02:36:57,325 --> 02:36:58,992
You!

1336
02:37:12,882 --> 02:37:14,674
What have I done?

1337
02:38:23,327 --> 02:38:24,870
Madness.

1338
02:38:37,425 --> 02:38:39,259
I had to do it.

1339
02:38:40,178 --> 02:38:43,430
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.

1340
02:38:43,931 --> 02:38:45,932
It was the only thing to do!

1341
02:39:22,220 --> 02:39:23,678
Madness.

1342
02:39:26,474 --> 02:39:27,682
Madness.
