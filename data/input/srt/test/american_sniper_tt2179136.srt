1
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:13,515
Hot weather.

2
00:02:14,524 --> 00:02:18,426
Land here it feels like
dog's stool.

3
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:20,326
You know, huh?

4
00:02:20,463 --> 00:02:22,260
Fuck!

5
00:02:28,504 --> 00:02:30,369
Smashed.

6
00:03:08,511 --> 00:03:13,448
There are men of military force, are
call, pay attention to the convoy. Replace.

7
00:03:13,482 --> 00:03:18,419
If she reported troop movements
please shoot. Your turn. Replace.

8
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:21,288
Maybe he called his wife.

9
00:03:28,497 --> 00:03:30,488
He dropped.

10
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:44,345
One Moment. There were women and children, within 200
yard, moving towards the convoy.

11
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:51,418
His arm is not moving.
He was carrying something.

12
00:04:01,397 --> 00:04:05,390
He pulls out a grenade. RKG grenade Russia.
I think he gave it to the boy.

13
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:10,304
- Women and children?
- Did you see it?
Can insure?

14
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:12,500
Negative. You know ROE.
Your turn.

15
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:16,341
- They will menggorengmu if you're wrong.
They will put you in jail.
- Fuck.

16
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:34,429
You managed to hit it.

17
00:04:52,281 --> 00:04:52,542
Back here.

18
00:04:55,518 --> 00:04:57,509
Never leave
rifle on the ground.

19
00:04:58,521 --> 00:04:59,510
Yes, Sir.

20
00:05:04,327 --> 00:05:07,524
Good shot.
You're talented.

21
00:05:09,398 --> 00:05:11,457
One day you will be a great hunter.

22
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:18,406
Listen to this book, several times.
That judgment ..

23
00:05:19,342 --> 00:05:20,502
for the trust.

24
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:25,441
Time where we have to do it.
We can not see with his eyes.

25
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:29,282
So we do not know the glory of his plans.

26
00:05:29,552 --> 00:05:34,285
Our eyes see
like the reflection in the glass.

27
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:37,289
- The day we arrived ...
- Why are you doing this?

28
00:05:39,261 --> 00:05:43,391
We will see it clearly.
And understand the mystery of how.

29
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,459
Let's pray.

30
00:05:46,435 --> 00:05:48,528
There are 3 types of people in this world.

31
00:05:49,538 --> 00:05:52,507
Sheep, wolf and sheepdog.

32
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:55,534
Some people believe

33
00:05:56,445 --> 00:05:58,504
the devil does not exist in the world--

34
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:02,478
And if hatred appeared at their door
do not know how to protect themselves.

35
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,445
It was a sheep.

36
00:06:05,554 --> 00:06:09,354
Then there are the predators. They use violence

37
00:06:09,358 --> 00:06:10,382
to prey on the weak.

38
00:06:10,426 --> 00:06:12,291
They are wolves.

39
00:06:13,396 --> 00:06:15,261
Then there are those

40
00:06:15,431 --> 00:06:17,456
blessed with talent aggression

41
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:20,428
and protect the flock.

42
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:25,499
They are a rare breed of living
to face serigala--

43
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,410
They sheepdog.

44
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:34,516
We do not raise sheep in this family

45
00:06:36,452 --> 00:06:39,387
and I will menghajarjika you
into a wolf.
- Wayne--

46
00:06:44,326 --> 00:06:46,260
But we protect our herd.

47
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,398
And if someone tried to fight

48
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,335
or protect your sister you get
my permission to finish.

49
00:06:54,336 --> 00:06:56,395
He attacked Jeff.

50
00:06:57,473 --> 00:07:01,432
Is that true?
- Yes, Sir. True.

51
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,371
And you finish it?

52
00:07:08,384 --> 00:07:10,284
You know who you are.

53
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,516
You know your goals.

54
00:08:09,345 --> 00:08:11,370
There is not anyone there.

55
00:08:11,547 --> 00:08:13,515
You come out with a waist belt.

56
00:08:14,283 --> 00:08:17,275
-What Should you do?
- Sleeping with it.

57
00:08:17,286 --> 00:08:20,551
-I Will wear it and see make
Sarah mood changed.
Strong -Angin make her mood changed.

58
00:08:20,556 --> 00:08:22,319
Is that what they say?

59
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:26,417
- You know what they call it when SMA--
Sarah menghisap--
- Do not say.

60
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:27,486
Jeez, Chris.

61
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,395
That recompense.

62
00:08:37,273 --> 00:08:42,506
-There Are two women ...
- He was watching.

63
00:08:43,312 --> 00:08:46,509
- Wait till you see this.
- Yes I Do.

64
00:08:47,349 --> 00:08:49,442
Hey, babe who wants
rodeo star?

65
00:08:49,451 --> 00:08:50,440
What the hell?

66
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:52,454
You said he did not come home until tomorrow.

67
00:08:52,454 --> 00:08:55,423
- I said what?
- Do not bother him.

68
00:08:55,457 --> 00:08:57,425
He did not do anything.

69
00:08:57,426 --> 00:08:59,360
Chris, do not disturb him!

70
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:01,454
Leave him alone!

71
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,294
Fuck, what's wrong with you ?!

72
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,461
- He does not know, okay?
-What Does he know?

73
00:09:06,502 --> 00:09:08,265
- You do not know?
-I Take my hat.

74
00:09:08,404 --> 00:09:11,464
He does not know.

75
00:09:11,473 --> 00:09:16,410
- You do not know?
-What Is wrong with you ?!

76
00:09:16,445 --> 00:09:19,414
Why did you do it
to everyone?

77
00:09:19,415 --> 00:09:21,383
Go away from here!

78
00:09:22,551 --> 00:09:25,315
What is wrong with you!

79
00:09:27,556 --> 00:09:30,389
- Run Out.
-I Do not know what you expect of me.

80
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:34,293
You brought me here and out
together with your sister every weekend!

81
00:09:35,264 --> 00:09:37,255
Why do you think I do this?

82
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:40,301
I'm doing this to get attention!

83
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:45,432
Take your things and get out.

84
00:09:46,508 --> 00:09:49,272
Okay. Screw you!

85
00:09:50,412 --> 00:09:52,471
Do you think you could be a rodeo cowboy for?

86
00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:56,307
You're not a cowboy. you just
farm administrators.

87
00:09:56,418 --> 00:09:58,409
And you lower!

88
00:10:04,526 --> 00:10:06,323
Do not say.

89
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:08,320
Oh My.

90
00:10:12,334 --> 00:10:17,465
I do not understand what you said.
We had to travel to another state.

91
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:20,468
Different city every weekend.

92
00:10:21,543 --> 00:10:25,502
- Can not stay here.
- Maybe he's right.

93
00:10:25,547 --> 00:10:29,381
- But he's right.
- True matter what, Chris?

94
00:10:29,518 --> 00:10:33,454
He's not true. We cowboy.
Living in a dream.

95
00:10:48,537 --> 00:10:53,440
Friend, friend see this.

96
00:11:12,494 --> 00:11:15,258
- You're from Texas?
- Yes, Sir.

97
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:16,492
- You're a patriot.
- Yes I Do.

98
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,391
- And you're angry.
-I Want to serve.

99
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:22,369
- Fight?
- Yes, Sir.

100
00:11:24,306 --> 00:11:27,275
Meet the elite fighters.

101
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,503
- Seals?
- Sea, air and land.

102
00:11:31,413 --> 00:11:35,406
-I Less able to swim, sir.
- This is not for a broken heart.

103
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:39,353
- Most people will stop.
-I Do not most people, sir.
I did not stop.

104
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,449
Lift your legs!

105
00:11:43,492 --> 00:11:47,553
Thank this!

106
00:11:47,563 --> 00:11:51,329
It was the first time.

107
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:55,435
If you are swept away, you're going to die!

108
00:11:55,471 --> 00:11:58,531
Do not turn your face from me.
View and accept this.

109
00:11:59,308 --> 00:12:01,469
Old old are you, huh?

110
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:05,439
Did you join the Navy
because they want to have fun in the Noah Ark?

111
00:12:05,447 --> 00:12:09,508
- How old are you?
30! You've dusty and disappeared.
- 30 years.

112
00:12:10,385 --> 00:12:12,319
We will do it again.

113
00:12:12,421 --> 00:12:17,358
We're going to be a fighter.

114
00:12:17,392 --> 00:12:20,259
I never see him.

115
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:24,322
I came to confront terrorists.

116
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,368
Who did it?

117
00:12:27,402 --> 00:12:29,529
I do not know.

118
00:12:29,538 --> 00:12:32,530
-Do I ask you?
- Do Not.

119
00:12:33,342 --> 00:12:36,277
See yourself.

120
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:42,477
You bastard! That's what I said.

121
00:12:43,318 --> 00:12:46,253
Biggles, the name now.

122
00:12:46,355 --> 00:12:48,323
And the tickets very difficult.

123
00:12:48,323 --> 00:12:52,487
What are you doing here if
you hate water?

124
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:54,462
Never mind, sir.
I'm not black.

125
00:12:54,496 --> 00:13:00,298
- Do Not?
-I New black. We ran slow,
low jump and swim.

126
00:13:00,335 --> 00:13:04,294
And I made a proud white skin!

127
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:11,369
That people who quit!

128
00:13:11,547 --> 00:13:13,481
You say goodbye.

129
00:13:14,349 --> 00:13:17,284
If he stops here,
He stopped on the battlefield.

130
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:21,321
When everything is in trouble,
he will not pull you out.

131
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,358
I'm looking for a knight.

132
00:13:26,428 --> 00:13:32,367
I can not hear?
You want to call your parents?
Maybe they can replace you.

133
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:37,427
This is a game.

134
00:13:37,472 --> 00:13:43,274
That's what I'm talking about.
- Where are you?

135
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:46,304
We will survive, sir!

136
00:13:46,381 --> 00:13:47,507
They are warm!

137
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,409
Give her speech.

138
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:53,445
How about you, old man?

139
00:13:55,357 --> 00:13:56,346
How are you?

140
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,289
Dangerous.

141
00:13:58,427 --> 00:14:03,296
I felt dangerous.
- He feels dangerous.

142
00:14:09,504 --> 00:14:11,529
Log In!

143
00:14:41,336 --> 00:14:43,327
Oh yes it penyiksaanmu!

144
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:46,466
Once more.

145
00:14:48,543 --> 00:14:52,377
If you want the target, use this.

146
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:57,247
- Hello.
- Hi There.

147
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:01,355
-How Are you?
- Okay, thank you.

148
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:09,419
- Can I buy you a drink?
-What Made you drink
higher 6 inches and charming?

149
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:11,465
Does not make you married?

150
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:15,333
I'm watching you.

151
00:15:15,437 --> 00:15:16,495
Do not be a loser.

152
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:18,335
Go home.

153
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,474
That might leather pants.

154
00:15:27,316 --> 00:15:28,374
Oh yes?

155
00:15:29,518 --> 00:15:32,316
What to wear pants women
so as not to be disturbed?

156
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:34,480
Maybe Corduroy.

157
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:40,225
What's wrong with kalian--
suddenly single after 3 beers?

158
00:15:40,395 --> 00:15:43,364
Which occurred after the third beer
is the fourth beer.

159
00:15:43,398 --> 00:15:45,491
Very good.

160
00:15:46,268 --> 00:15:49,396
- Red-neck real.
-I Am not a red-neck,
I Texans.

161
00:15:49,538 --> 00:15:54,475
-What's The difference?
- We rode horses,
they rode his cousin.

162
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,437
What do you do before?

163
00:15:57,479 --> 00:16:03,475
-I Polish dolphins. they should
polished or broken skin.
-Do I look stupid to you?

164
00:16:04,386 --> 00:16:06,320
No, you look sad.

165
00:16:10,425 --> 00:16:12,416
Am I high enough to
buy you a drink?

166
00:16:12,527 --> 00:16:16,395
Not until you tell me your job.
- Okay, how about this ..

167
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:22,367
One glass for one question.

168
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:25,272
- How Do?
- Ok.

169
00:16:25,374 --> 00:16:28,400
Okay asked.

170
00:16:28,543 --> 00:16:30,534
You're military. Which branch?

171
00:16:30,545 --> 00:16:34,276
I just completed the BUD / S.

172
00:16:34,316 --> 00:16:36,511
- Are you kidding? You Seal?
- Yes, ma'am.

173
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:40,284
That's two questions.

174
00:16:40,522 --> 00:16:41,420
Shit.

175
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:49,320
I do not mean to do it.

176
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:52,266
Okay, honestly.

177
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:55,259
I know about all of you.
My sister is engaged to Seal.

178
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,429
- Is It True?
- Yes I Do.

179
00:16:57,439 --> 00:17:00,340
What do you mean you know
all about us?

180
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:07,278
You're a bunch of arrogant, selfish
he who thinks can lie
and do as you please.

181
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:09,317
I never dated SEAL.

182
00:17:09,551 --> 00:17:13,282
What do you mean selfish?
I am devoted to my country.

183
00:17:13,422 --> 00:17:17,415
- Why?
- Because this is the best country on earth
and I deserve to be protected.

184
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:20,494
I'm sorry this happened to your sister
but it was not me.

185
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,296
Nice to meet you.

186
00:17:24,499 --> 00:17:28,526
- Where are you going?
-I Will go home, you say no
be dating SEAL.

187
00:17:30,405 --> 00:17:32,464
I said I'd never marry.

188
00:17:33,341 --> 00:17:37,277
Hello, nice to meet you?

189
00:17:37,312 --> 00:17:38,472
- What is your name?
- Taya.

190
00:17:39,314 --> 00:17:39,541
Taya.

191
00:17:40,348 --> 00:17:43,374
I'm Chris Kyle.
Nice to meet you.

192
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,279
You're very selfish thought could
protect us all, right Chris?

193
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:53,451
Our commander says

194
00:17:55,397 --> 00:17:59,299
there are three things that should we worry about:
ego, alcohol and women.

195
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:02,326
Sounds like you are being attacked.

196
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:06,465
You are beautiful.

197
00:18:07,476 --> 00:18:09,341
So you ...

198
00:18:19,287 --> 00:18:20,345
I got you.

199
00:18:28,497 --> 00:18:31,398
I'm not going home with you
so do not think about it.

200
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:44,342
Feel the air filling every cell
in the body.

201
00:18:46,448 --> 00:18:47,472
This is our ritual.

202
00:18:48,283 --> 00:18:51,446
We mastered the breath, we master
mind kita--

203
00:18:52,487 --> 00:18:55,354
pull the trigger will
become unconscious effort.

204
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,425
You will notice
but not directing it.

205
00:18:58,426 --> 00:19:02,328
When you exhale,
regarded as pause,

206
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,330
and the space between heartbeats.

207
00:19:21,383 --> 00:19:24,511
Hey this Taya, I can not
pick up the phone. Leave It
message and call you back.

208
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:28,250
Hey it's me. men who
shoes you muntahi.

209
00:19:28,423 --> 00:19:33,292
I think you do not receive
my last message. Or previous message.

210
00:19:33,361 --> 00:19:36,330
- So I was thinking ...
- You think what?

211
00:19:36,364 --> 00:19:39,356
Hey, how are you?
How are you?

212
00:19:40,302 --> 00:19:43,396
- Okay.
- Well ... okay ...

213
00:19:43,538 --> 00:19:44,527
What are you doing?

214
00:19:45,473 --> 00:19:47,464
Being lazy.
Do you?

215
00:19:48,276 --> 00:19:50,471
I just wanted to talk to you.

216
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:03,514
Small binoculars, a little escape. If you
mengeker buttons, may
missed 2 inches.

217
00:20:04,326 --> 00:20:07,295
If mengeker shirt, maybe
missed 2 feet.

218
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:16,303
You better shut it, Kyle.

219
00:20:16,371 --> 00:20:17,395
Yes, Sir.

220
00:20:21,443 --> 00:20:22,501
I'll play it.

221
00:20:22,577 --> 00:20:26,411
- You like that one?
- That one.

222
00:20:26,414 --> 00:20:28,507
- This is your prize.
- Thank you sir.

223
00:20:28,516 --> 00:20:30,507
- Thank you. Hello.
- Good afternoon.

224
00:20:30,552 --> 00:20:33,248
Looks good with you.

225
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:38,518
Have you always wanted to be a soldier?
- No, I want to be a cowboy

226
00:20:38,526 --> 00:20:44,226
I did it and felt need anything else.
- So you start to save women
of the bar?

227
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:47,291
I saved the bar it from you.

228
00:20:48,336 --> 00:20:49,530
Do you like country music?

229
00:20:50,438 --> 00:20:52,303
Only when I'm depressed.

230
00:20:54,442 --> 00:20:58,378
-I Love children. You like?
- One day.

231
00:20:59,281 --> 00:21:01,442
My mother said I had a nose for
choose the wrong man.

232
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:04,442
That's a bad thing to say
to a woman.

233
00:21:05,353 --> 00:21:06,513
He was right.

234
00:21:07,322 --> 00:21:09,290
That brought you here.

235
00:21:10,358 --> 00:21:13,486
Make yourself a present.
I like it.

236
00:21:15,497 --> 00:21:19,365
Do you ever think that happened?

237
00:21:20,368 --> 00:21:23,235
I do not know.
I wish I could do the job.

238
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:37,450
Do we see the same target?

239
00:21:38,286 --> 00:21:39,344
You spit in the dust.

240
00:21:39,487 --> 00:21:43,423
Do not worry, we can use
substitute for people who
can not shoot.

241
00:21:45,293 --> 00:21:46,260
Oh shit!

242
00:22:11,353 --> 00:22:13,514
- You're shaking.
-I Know.

243
00:22:15,423 --> 00:22:17,288
- We do not need to do this.
- No, I would.

244
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:20,460
- Yes I Do.
-I Want to feel it.

245
00:22:31,506 --> 00:22:33,371
You close your eyes?

246
00:22:34,342 --> 00:22:36,469
If I close my eyes,
can not see the target.

247
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:40,378
There was nothing there
except the target.
- Negative. There's something there.

248
00:22:40,515 --> 00:22:42,278
Come Here.

249
00:22:43,351 --> 00:22:46,411
Give me 50 push-ups, Kyle.

250
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:55,353
I'm a better shot.

251
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:03,298
- Oh Lord, Chris. Do Not.
-What Is wrong?

252
00:23:48,316 --> 00:23:52,309
- You just know me.
- Yes I Do.

253
00:23:57,425 --> 00:23:59,325
What are you scared of?

254
00:23:59,461 --> 00:24:00,450
Nothing.

255
00:24:02,497 --> 00:24:06,331
Everything. I do not know.
What if it did not work?

256
00:24:07,502 --> 00:24:10,471
We'll get married and
start a family.

257
00:24:11,406 --> 00:24:14,307
You've planned it, right.

258
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:18,404
I finished. I love you.

259
00:24:21,349 --> 00:24:24,512
You need a ring if you want to speak strong
like that.
- Ok.

260
00:24:34,295 --> 00:24:39,255
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and Mrs. Chris Kyle.

261
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,534
What happened to your neck?

262
00:24:50,512 --> 00:24:52,503
No makeup neck.

263
00:24:53,414 --> 00:24:57,475
Percayajika you say that?

264
00:24:58,286 --> 00:24:59,412
What?

265
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:04,314
Because they.
- Oh, God.

266
00:25:06,494 --> 00:25:08,325
Cheers.

267
00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:10,263
What he said, Chief?

268
00:25:10,565 --> 00:25:13,500
We just received a call.
Task!

269
00:25:16,304 --> 00:25:19,501
Yes I Do!

270
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,280
Yeah, wow!

271
00:25:30,351 --> 00:25:33,377
- Let them.
-I Am very scared.

272
00:25:33,388 --> 00:25:36,448
Nothing to be afraid of.
It's part of the plan.

273
00:25:37,358 --> 00:25:40,486
Your heart beats.

274
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:44,296
Because I'm going to go to war.

275
00:26:00,481 --> 00:26:02,278
Welcome to Fallujah.

276
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,384
The new wild west in the middle east old.

277
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:10,389
AQL put up the price of your head and
extremists from around the world come
to the border to collect.

278
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:19,427
You sniper paired with
someone who take care of you and keep
Marines were checking the position.

279
00:26:19,467 --> 00:26:22,493
Your duty to protect
Marines whatever it takes.

280
00:26:22,503 --> 00:26:27,406
The city has been evacuated. Militias are still
was here

281
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:29,476
wants to kill you.

282
00:26:30,378 --> 00:26:33,370
Bring them home safely.
We can go home.

283
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:53,424
Run Out. Run Out.

284
00:26:55,303 --> 00:26:57,294
Lower your head, Tex.

285
00:26:57,505 --> 00:27:00,372
Muj also got a sniper.

286
00:27:00,441 --> 00:27:02,432
Sniper will not be aiming for your head.

287
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,404
They have a sniper

288
00:27:07,315 --> 00:27:10,284
who could shoot the head
from a distance of 500 yards.

289
00:27:13,554 --> 00:27:15,522
They called Mustafa.

290
00:27:16,491 --> 00:27:18,425
He followed the Olympics.

291
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,485
There is a sniper shooting in the Olympics?

292
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:41,441
There were women and children within 200 yards
towards the convoy.

293
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,356
His arms were silent, he brings something.

294
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,426
He brought a grenade Russia
and given to the child.

295
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:07,340
Do you see it? Can insure?
- Negative.

296
00:28:07,341 --> 00:28:13,302
You know ROE. Your turn.
- If one of them will menggorengmu.

297
00:28:55,456 --> 00:28:58,448
Wanitajalang jerk!

298
00:29:01,329 --> 00:29:03,388
Good shot, Tex.
Nice One.

299
00:29:03,498 --> 00:29:05,398
Received. Nice AL.

300
00:29:05,433 --> 00:29:07,492
- Damn.
- Do not touch me.

301
00:29:34,495 --> 00:29:36,258
Where is everyone?

302
00:29:36,297 --> 00:29:41,360
- Train the soldiers Hajj.
- Why do not you there?

303
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:46,331
I have a problem.
- Do you still read comics?

304
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,465
This graphic novel, bro.

305
00:29:49,377 --> 00:29:51,277
There is a difference.

306
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,416
I heard you shot someone.
You made it?

307
00:29:57,285 --> 00:29:58,309
Is It True?

308
00:29:58,486 --> 00:30:02,320
There is a child who has not had feathers
The cock

309
00:30:02,323 --> 00:30:04,257
His mother gave grenade

310
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,528
send out for
Marines killed.

311
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,459
I've never seen it before.

312
00:30:15,436 --> 00:30:20,464
Yeah, but you know the kid
can kill 10 Marines, huh?

313
00:30:21,275 --> 00:30:24,369
You're doing your job.
End of story.

314
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,306
This is not like the way I do it.

315
00:30:45,366 --> 00:30:47,391
Fuck! What the hell!

316
00:30:48,402 --> 00:30:50,393
Are you watching, Einstein?

317
00:30:50,504 --> 00:30:52,369
You can thank him later.

318
00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:56,469
Moving On!

319
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,441
Fast.

320
00:31:12,526 --> 00:31:19,261
There is a car bomb!

321
00:31:25,406 --> 00:31:27,567
Hold your fire!

322
00:33:20,388 --> 00:33:23,482
Keep an eye on the roof!

323
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:45,273
There were shot.

324
00:33:45,513 --> 00:33:52,442
Visible enemy snipers.
Location R155704.

325
00:33:59,527 --> 00:34:01,495
Stinks here.

326
00:34:01,495 --> 00:34:05,454
You protect us.
That's a good shot.

327
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,264
- Clean, right?
- True.

328
00:34:09,503 --> 00:34:12,267
Enemy sniper sneaked in.

329
00:34:12,306 --> 00:34:14,467
Yes, it will not happen again.

330
00:34:14,508 --> 00:34:18,467
Should not happen again.
There is a hot entrusted quarter mile away.

331
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:20,413
I will make a report.

332
00:34:20,414 --> 00:34:23,315
- How much do you get?
-I Can be six.

333
00:34:23,317 --> 00:34:26,480
No, I can be eight,
but they dragged two people.

334
00:34:27,421 --> 00:34:30,322
- You can be six?
- Yes, why?

335
00:34:30,357 --> 00:34:34,316
- You can be more than the others.
- Yes, but they can be one of us.

336
00:34:34,328 --> 00:34:36,387
You can not shoot what
can not you see.

337
00:34:37,565 --> 00:34:42,468
- His wife told him to bring the Qur'an.
-I Do not know the form of the Qur'an.

338
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,461
But I can describe what he was carrying.

339
00:34:44,472 --> 00:34:49,273
Metal objects, firing bullets 7.62,
and looks like the AK-47.

340
00:34:49,276 --> 00:34:51,244
So what does he bring?

341
00:35:02,423 --> 00:35:03,481
He came.

342
00:35:03,524 --> 00:35:09,292
Ladies and gentlemen, listen up.
There is a legend among us.

343
00:35:09,463 --> 00:35:12,489
Give him a big applause.

344
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:18,370
The legend is already making a record.
He killed 100 people with one shot.

345
00:35:18,405 --> 00:35:23,502
One shot of a man.

346
00:35:23,511 --> 00:35:25,536
He '' blow '' 100 men.

347
00:35:25,546 --> 00:35:30,245
And he's still single.

348
00:35:30,284 --> 00:35:33,481
Oh My.

349
00:35:33,487 --> 00:35:35,478
Competition throw food? Come on.

350
00:35:36,524 --> 00:35:39,357
The only way to make silent.

351
00:35:41,428 --> 00:35:43,396
Did you kill people?

352
00:35:43,531 --> 00:35:48,264
Not the way to start a conversation, dear.

353
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:50,530
Do not behave like that to me.

354
00:35:51,405 --> 00:35:53,430
I want you to tell me everything.

355
00:35:54,308 --> 00:35:57,368
There are some things that are not
can be said on the phone.

356
00:35:57,478 --> 00:36:02,415
You make me pregnant and I sat
alone install cots ...

357
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:03,508
... and you can not talk to me?

358
00:36:04,485 --> 00:36:06,453
That's your big plan?

359
00:36:08,422 --> 00:36:10,481
All is fine there?

360
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:15,294
I can not stop thinking about
the pink dress.

361
00:36:16,397 --> 00:36:19,298
His name evening dress.

362
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:21,324
Yes I Do.

363
00:36:21,468 --> 00:36:26,496
Three days is not counted as a honeymoon.

364
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,304
It was three days of fun.

365
00:36:33,547 --> 00:36:38,314
-I Miss you.
-I Missed you.

366
00:36:38,385 --> 00:36:43,516
- You want me to talk naughty to you?
- Yes, wait a minute.

367
00:36:49,296 --> 00:36:52,288
I was holding a rifle.

368
00:36:52,299 --> 00:36:55,427
You must decide which
more importantly, dear.

369
00:36:56,437 --> 00:36:59,270
You really are lust.

370
00:36:59,306 --> 00:37:02,275
I'm fat and horny.
That's disgusting.

371
00:37:02,476 --> 00:37:05,445
Although the weight is 150 pounds,
I still want to make love to you.

372
00:37:06,313 --> 00:37:09,510
- Really romantic.
- What about my son?

373
00:37:10,451 --> 00:37:15,445
- No one said he was a man.
- You two would be amazing.

374
00:37:16,323 --> 00:37:17,517
How do you know?

375
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,387
I know. I can see it.

376
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:26,558
- I hope you're right.
-I Am right.

377
00:37:29,536 --> 00:37:33,472
-Ayahmu Contacted you?
-I Do not check my email.

378
00:37:33,507 --> 00:37:35,407
Oh My.

379
00:37:35,409 --> 00:37:37,502
You should call him, okay?

380
00:37:37,544 --> 00:37:40,513
-What Is wrong?
-I Do not think straight.

381
00:37:40,547 --> 00:37:43,448
What is wrong?

382
00:37:45,486 --> 00:37:49,388
- Your brother is sent.
-What Do you mean? To a school?

383
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:52,484
No, he did not go to school.
Just call your father.

384
00:37:52,526 --> 00:37:55,427
What do you mean? Where is she?

385
00:37:56,297 --> 00:37:57,457
Right there.

386
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,528
He headed Iraqis.

387
00:38:01,402 --> 00:38:03,495
Sorry dear.

388
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:12,478
The man who held the knife is a member
Jordan radicals funded Bin Laden.

389
00:38:12,513 --> 00:38:16,313
Trained by Bin Laden,
loyal to bin Laden.

390
00:38:16,317 --> 00:38:19,411
His name was Zarqawi.

391
00:38:19,553 --> 00:38:24,513
The jerk is the prince
Al-Qaeda in the Iraqis.

392
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:29,393
Troops, AQL, amounted to 5 thousand people.

393
00:38:29,396 --> 00:38:31,455
They are not ordinary mercenary force.

394
00:38:31,498 --> 00:38:34,296
They are well trained, well paid ...

395
00:38:34,301 --> 00:38:38,499
... and this time, they run the operation
biggest offensive since Vietnam.

396
00:38:39,406 --> 00:38:43,536
Zarqawi and his Lieutenant, they
is our top priority.

397
00:38:43,544 --> 00:38:46,513
There is only one way to
find them.

398
00:38:46,513 --> 00:38:51,246
Ie check from door to door,
until we find them ...

399
00:38:51,285 --> 00:38:54,345
... or someone who can
provide their location.

400
00:38:54,521 --> 00:38:59,254
So we need to examine 10
building per hour.

401
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:01,557
I know it very much,
very aggressive.

402
00:39:01,562 --> 00:39:05,293
Do not rely too much on
air support.

403
00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:09,292
This is a priority target
The highest until today.

404
00:39:09,336 --> 00:39:13,466
I want them dead or captured, understand?

405
00:39:14,408 --> 00:39:16,273
Any question?

406
00:39:20,381 --> 00:39:24,340
If the Marines in haste,
they could be shot.

407
00:39:24,385 --> 00:39:26,444
They can not be training like us.

408
00:39:26,453 --> 00:39:28,421
Most of them
civilians 6 months ago.

409
00:39:28,422 --> 00:39:32,324
Let us train them.
I'll show you how to them.

410
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:34,350
No, we need you to keep an eye on the situation.

411
00:39:34,361 --> 00:39:38,388
- The enemy already knows we're up there.
- Under very dangerous.

412
00:39:39,299 --> 00:39:41,267
You want to be the savior?

413
00:39:41,268 --> 00:39:44,260
I just wanted to catch them.
Can not see, can not shoot.

414
00:39:44,304 --> 00:39:47,432
They all know your name.
They feel safe when you're up there.

415
00:39:47,474 --> 00:39:50,272
- Do Not.
- That's what they think.

416
00:39:50,444 --> 00:39:54,346
So stay up there, watch them.

417
00:40:04,558 --> 00:40:08,255
You said snipers AQL
never follow the Olympics?

418
00:40:08,295 --> 00:40:11,264
While the Iraqis have not qualified
for three Olympics.

419
00:40:11,265 --> 00:40:14,291
Mustafa instead of Iraqis.

420
00:40:15,536 --> 00:40:17,504
He is from Syria.

421
00:40:28,549 --> 00:40:31,382
Once you get in, I do not
could see nothing.

422
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:33,478
So only slowly.

423
00:40:33,554 --> 00:40:36,250
Okay.

424
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:39,282
Log In!

425
00:40:56,376 --> 00:40:58,276
To hell with this.

426
00:40:58,512 --> 00:41:01,413
I will go down to the bottom
with the marines.

427
00:41:01,515 --> 00:41:03,244
You coming?

428
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:05,442
Do Not.

429
00:41:05,452 --> 00:41:09,388
I want to go home alive.

430
00:41:09,423 --> 00:41:14,486
Not my job knocking on the door.
I do not want to do that.

431
00:41:14,495 --> 00:41:16,520
If I do not see you down there ...

432
00:41:17,531 --> 00:41:20,432
... make sure I will not see you again.

433
00:41:26,273 --> 00:41:28,332
Hey, do you mind if I come with you?

434
00:41:28,542 --> 00:41:31,340
Of course.

435
00:41:32,412 --> 00:41:35,540
You're the legend that, right?
You've killed 24 people?

436
00:41:36,283 --> 00:41:38,342
-I Do not count.
- That was really cool.

437
00:41:38,385 --> 00:41:40,546
There was a nigger in Bravo
the chase.

438
00:41:40,554 --> 00:41:43,489
I know a few things.

439
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:47,256
There are several things that can
I show you, how?

440
00:41:47,394 --> 00:41:49,453
All Right.

441
00:41:54,268 --> 00:41:56,361
-What Does it mean?
- Break.

442
00:42:02,509 --> 00:42:06,377
Get down on the floor right now!

443
00:42:07,481 --> 00:42:09,540
- Do not!
- Get down!

444
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:15,318
Why are you here?
You should have an evacuation.

445
00:42:15,355 --> 00:42:17,323
Who are you?

446
00:42:17,324 --> 00:42:19,554
I do not care about this house.

447
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:23,360
This is a war zone, sir.
Get down.

448
00:42:23,463 --> 00:42:25,328
Fast.

449
00:42:26,266 --> 00:42:27,426
They hide behind.

450
00:42:29,336 --> 00:42:31,304
Still no one else in this house?

451
00:42:32,306 --> 00:42:35,366
He's going to blow us.

452
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:37,275
Searched his clothes.

453
00:42:37,311 --> 00:42:40,542
- He knows we're talking.
- Who are you talking about?

454
00:42:40,547 --> 00:42:43,414
Who knew we talk?

455
00:42:43,417 --> 00:42:48,354
He cut ...

456
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:53,357
- Please ...
- Target is secured?

457
00:42:53,393 --> 00:42:56,419
Okay, take him.
Put your hands behind your head.

458
00:42:57,364 --> 00:42:58,490
The Current! Fast!

459
00:43:04,504 --> 00:43:06,369
Take him into another room.

460
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,510
When he spoke, a
he will come to his house.

461
00:43:15,549 --> 00:43:17,483
Who is he? ''

462
00:43:22,289 --> 00:43:26,419
Someone named Butcher.
A son of the Devil.

463
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,360
He was a bouncer?

464
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,355
Zarqawi's number one soldier.

465
00:43:32,366 --> 00:43:34,231
- Zarqawi?
- Zarqawi.

466
00:43:34,267 --> 00:43:36,326
Yes, we want to know the location of Zarqawi.
You know where he is?

467
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:39,464
Tell us where he is.
How can we meet?

468
00:43:39,506 --> 00:43:44,307
You no information about Zarqawi?

469
00:43:44,311 --> 00:43:46,336
Find Butchers,
you will find Zarqawi.

470
00:43:46,346 --> 00:43:47,370
Okay, how do we find him?

471
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:52,510
Look at me when you're talking.
Where can we find it?

472
00:43:55,455 --> 00:43:58,424
He asked for money.

473
00:44:01,528 --> 00:44:04,463
- 100 thousand dollars.
- You need 100 thousand dollars?

474
00:44:04,498 --> 00:44:06,489
You do not have any evidence of this guy there.

475
00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:17,401
Hello.

476
00:44:23,316 --> 00:44:24,442
This is the proof.

477
00:44:24,518 --> 00:44:30,320
I want to help, but I need something.
Phone number, address, name.

478
00:44:31,491 --> 00:44:35,291
- Sir, the third team need help.
- Moving On!

479
00:44:35,362 --> 00:44:38,490
Look at me when you're talking.
Hey, look at me.

480
00:44:38,498 --> 00:44:41,433
I need something.
I can help.

481
00:44:41,435 --> 00:44:43,460
Give me a name,
we will take care of it.

482
00:44:43,503 --> 00:44:46,267
I bisajanji you.
Will I guarantee you safety.

483
00:44:46,306 --> 00:44:48,274
Tell us.

484
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:53,541
-Amir Khalaf Fanus?
- That was the original name of the Butchers.

485
00:44:54,448 --> 00:44:57,474
He was the number two Zarqawi.

486
00:44:57,517 --> 00:44:59,348
He's the one.

487
00:44:59,352 --> 00:45:02,378
Yes, but you do not know his real name,
otherwise you would have written.

488
00:45:03,457 --> 00:45:05,516
There are several pseudonyms.

489
00:45:06,393 --> 00:45:11,421
If your information is correct,
we met the Sheik.

490
00:45:11,431 --> 00:45:14,264
He asked for 100 thousand dollars.

491
00:45:14,301 --> 00:45:16,462
If he can submit Butchers,
he will get it.

492
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:22,306
This Agent Snead, DIA.
Check the name Amir Khalaf Fanus.

493
00:45:22,476 --> 00:45:23,534
Yes, I'll wait.

494
00:45:24,377 --> 00:45:27,244
If we're going back there,
3 teams could just ...

495
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,511
Can not. Centres need contractors
if we would send money.

496
00:45:31,284 --> 00:45:32,444
Yes, what you got?

497
00:45:37,457 --> 00:45:38,481
Ok.

498
00:45:41,294 --> 00:45:42,454
Let's meet the Sheik.

499
00:45:59,346 --> 00:46:00,438
Who is our target?

500
00:46:00,547 --> 00:46:03,448
Bouncer Zarqawi.

501
00:46:03,483 --> 00:46:06,452
They say she likes to wear
a drill as a weapon.

502
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,480
Prior to joining the Marines
I joined the seminary school.

503
00:46:11,458 --> 00:46:15,394
-I Hampirjadi pastor.
- Why do so?

504
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:19,298
I like to bet.

505
00:46:19,432 --> 00:46:21,491
I love the game of dice.

506
00:46:39,352 --> 00:46:40,478
Personal cell phone?

507
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,318
You have not heard? I legend.

508
00:46:44,357 --> 00:46:48,384
- Hey, baby.
- You're right, the doctor told the boy.

509
00:46:49,296 --> 00:46:50,320
What?

510
00:46:51,498 --> 00:46:55,332
-little Boy.
- A boy!

511
00:46:56,369 --> 00:46:58,496
Nice One. Congratulations.

512
00:47:13,553 --> 00:47:15,316
Chris?

513
00:47:15,355 --> 00:47:18,518
Take the money. Refuge.

514
00:47:25,532 --> 00:47:28,501
Take the bag!

515
00:47:31,538 --> 00:47:32,527
Chris?

516
00:47:37,577 --> 00:47:41,274
Let's go from here.

517
00:47:44,351 --> 00:47:45,409
Dear?

518
00:47:45,452 --> 00:47:49,388
- I heard one shot.
- From a high angle.

519
00:47:49,522 --> 00:47:53,288
- 280 meters.
-Oh My.

520
00:47:56,396 --> 00:47:59,456
- Did you see it?
- Do Not.

521
00:48:00,533 --> 00:48:06,267
Damn, he took the child from the Sheik.

522
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:18,308
Ask for help.
We are stuck.

523
00:48:18,351 --> 00:48:22,310
Location, 4,536,237.

524
00:48:22,322 --> 00:48:25,519
I will throw smoke grenades.

525
00:48:29,362 --> 00:48:30,454
Wait.

526
00:48:36,436 --> 00:48:39,405
Wait.

527
00:48:40,507 --> 00:48:41,531
Forward!

528
00:50:14,501 --> 00:50:17,493
Who will die open mouth.

529
00:50:38,358 --> 00:50:40,519
Come on!

530
00:50:41,394 --> 00:50:42,520
Screw you!

531
00:50:53,373 --> 00:50:55,500
Gosh, messy once.

532
00:50:56,276 --> 00:50:58,301
You're a fool.

533
00:50:58,344 --> 00:51:02,303
What do you think?
You failed to secure the location.

534
00:51:02,549 --> 00:51:05,484
This will stop them all.
Back to headquarters.

535
00:51:05,485 --> 00:51:09,444
- We have to go after them.
- No, the mission was canceled.

536
00:51:10,256 --> 00:51:13,419
-What Do you mean?
- They will be making plans.

537
00:51:13,426 --> 00:51:16,327
We can not let
they run like that.

538
00:51:16,429 --> 00:51:18,488
I'll be home in 3 weeks.

539
00:51:19,499 --> 00:51:22,400
It will be three weeks long.

540
00:52:18,391 --> 00:52:20,450
- You are okay?
- Yes I Do.

541
00:52:22,428 --> 00:52:24,293
It is okay.

542
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:26,321
I'm here.

543
00:52:35,542 --> 00:52:37,533
- You are okay?
- Yes I Do.

544
00:52:57,330 --> 00:53:00,322
You're the most beautiful woman
I've seen.

545
00:53:00,466 --> 00:53:03,333
There was an alien in my body.

546
00:53:04,537 --> 00:53:09,440
- And there was a strange man in my room.
- Our room.

547
00:53:13,479 --> 00:53:15,504
Your hand feels different.

548
00:53:19,419 --> 00:53:21,546
This is my hand.

549
00:53:22,488 --> 00:53:25,389
- Why am I so nervous ...
-I Also nervous.

550
00:53:25,425 --> 00:53:27,552
- Do Not.
-I Oath.

551
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:31,394
What if the alien was holding me?

552
00:53:31,497 --> 00:53:33,362
How Do?

553
00:53:33,433 --> 00:53:34,491
Spooky.

554
00:53:36,502 --> 00:53:38,470
You're laughing.

555
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:43,433
Everything will be alright.

556
00:53:43,476 --> 00:53:45,410
- Promise?
- Yes, of course.

557
00:53:48,414 --> 00:53:51,247
You're very good to me.

558
00:53:58,424 --> 00:54:00,449
Maybe we could get out.

559
00:54:02,262 --> 00:54:03,388
Are you listening?

560
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:07,297
- Chris?
-What?

561
00:54:08,268 --> 00:54:09,496
What you want to do today?

562
00:54:13,473 --> 00:54:16,340
We can relax here.

563
00:54:19,312 --> 00:54:20,404
Okay, okay.

564
00:54:22,515 --> 00:54:25,313
Let us relax.

565
00:54:25,451 --> 00:54:28,511
-What Are you doing?
- Tease.

566
00:54:28,521 --> 00:54:32,287
You're good at teasing.

567
00:54:33,526 --> 00:54:36,290
I will be there.

568
00:54:44,537 --> 00:54:48,473
All looks good.

569
00:54:49,442 --> 00:54:52,377
-What Do you feel?
-I Am fine.

570
00:54:52,378 --> 00:54:55,370
- Soon will come out.
- I hope so.

571
00:54:55,415 --> 00:54:59,351
-What Are you, Mr. Kyle?
-I Just fine, thank you.

572
00:54:59,352 --> 00:55:02,378
Surely you're still adapting.

573
00:55:03,356 --> 00:55:04,482
Do Not.

574
00:55:04,524 --> 00:55:10,292
It was the first time we left the house.
-I Am glad to be home.

575
00:55:12,365 --> 00:55:14,526
Please use this.

576
00:55:16,269 --> 00:55:19,295
I do not want to be checked.

577
00:55:19,305 --> 00:55:21,273
- Are you a smoker?
- Do Not.

578
00:55:21,307 --> 00:55:23,468
- Do you drink?
- Only when I'm thirsty.

579
00:55:31,317 --> 00:55:33,478
- 170-110.
-Oh My.

580
00:55:34,287 --> 00:55:36,380
- Chris ...
- That's a high figure?

581
00:55:36,422 --> 00:55:40,324
As if you just drank 40 cups of coffee.

582
00:55:40,326 --> 00:55:43,454
I appreciate the thought.

583
00:55:44,297 --> 00:55:46,424
- Thank you.
- You're going to check it?

584
00:55:46,432 --> 00:55:47,524
Yes I Do.

585
00:55:50,336 --> 00:55:53,396
- You're pranking earlier.
-What Should I do? You did not say anything.

586
00:55:53,406 --> 00:55:56,239
- As if all is fine.
- Everything is fine.

587
00:55:56,275 --> 00:56:00,439
No, Chris, your blood pressure 170-110.

588
00:56:00,446 --> 00:56:04,439
I'm driving a car
on the highway in bright daylight.

589
00:56:04,484 --> 00:56:07,317
I am fine. being there
war, people die.

590
00:56:07,353 --> 00:56:09,378
And there's nothing to talk about,
as if nothing ever happened.

591
00:56:09,422 --> 00:56:13,518
We're on the way home.
Life is simple.

592
00:56:13,526 --> 00:56:16,393
There is not even in the news,
nobody cares.

593
00:56:16,396 --> 00:56:18,455
Currently no war and
I go to a mall.

594
00:56:18,498 --> 00:56:20,523
I should be there.

595
00:56:20,533 --> 00:56:23,297
-What Is wrong? You are okay?
- It would come out.

596
00:56:23,336 --> 00:56:25,429
Gosh, okay.

597
00:56:29,342 --> 00:56:32,334
- You're crazy.
- It is okay.

598
00:56:33,413 --> 00:56:36,246
Gosh, dear.

599
00:56:36,282 --> 00:56:37,476
You look beautiful.

600
00:56:37,517 --> 00:56:39,485
Soon born.

601
00:56:51,297 --> 00:56:52,423
Hi There.

602
00:56:53,266 --> 00:56:54,460
Hi There.

603
00:56:57,303 --> 00:56:58,531
Hi, little man.

604
00:57:17,557 --> 00:57:20,390
Our baby cry,
I thought you would calm him down.

605
00:57:20,426 --> 00:57:23,293
I've watched it.

606
00:57:23,463 --> 00:57:26,398
I have to make sure you
did not have a mistress.

607
00:57:26,432 --> 00:57:30,334
Recording enemy sniper victim.
He sold his recording on the streets.

608
00:57:30,336 --> 00:57:31,462
The victim of the American army.

609
00:57:33,306 --> 00:57:35,433
When we are on the phone, what was he?

610
00:57:36,442 --> 00:57:37,409
Right?

611
00:57:39,412 --> 00:57:42,506
Speak Up. You do not protect
with silent.

612
00:57:42,548 --> 00:57:46,245
-I Do not want to talk.
- Lmajinasiku very bad.

613
00:57:46,285 --> 00:57:48,480
- They are barbarians.
- Chris.

614
00:57:48,521 --> 00:57:51,388
- They are barbarians.
- This is not about them.

615
00:57:52,458 --> 00:57:54,323
It's about us.

616
00:57:55,528 --> 00:57:57,325
What?

617
00:58:02,335 --> 00:58:04,462
You've got to get back to us.

618
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:10,236
Ok?

619
00:58:13,446 --> 00:58:17,382
Welcome back.
Colonel wait.

620
00:58:17,383 --> 00:58:19,317
Back from vacation.

621
00:58:19,485 --> 00:58:21,316
True.

622
00:58:23,489 --> 00:58:27,448
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Okay, hurry up.

623
00:58:29,295 --> 00:58:30,455
Hey.

624
00:58:32,398 --> 00:58:33,524
Brother ...

625
00:58:37,336 --> 00:58:40,362
- You are okay?
- I heard you in action here.

626
00:58:40,406 --> 00:58:42,374
All the talk about you.

627
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:44,309
That's what they say?

628
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:46,505
How are you?
You are okay?

629
00:58:46,546 --> 00:58:50,414
You are my hero.

630
00:58:50,416 --> 00:58:54,443
-Come On, Kyle! Colonel wait.
- The legend.

631
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:58,416
You are okay?

632
00:58:58,457 --> 00:59:01,392
Yes, I would skip tumpanganku.

633
00:59:02,361 --> 00:59:04,261
I'm just tired.

634
00:59:04,397 --> 00:59:07,366
I want to go home.

635
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,400
I am proud of you.

636
00:59:11,304 --> 00:59:13,465
The father was also proud of you.

637
00:59:15,341 --> 00:59:17,275
To hell with this place.

638
00:59:18,444 --> 00:59:22,244
- You said what?
To hell with this place.

639
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:29,488
Come on.

640
00:59:50,476 --> 00:59:54,276
- Congratulations.
- Thank you sir.

641
00:59:54,447 --> 00:59:59,441
Gronsky and officers
top was gone.

642
01:00:00,353 --> 01:00:06,314
I've studied them.
I know everything.

643
01:00:06,359 --> 01:00:10,386
This war is influenced by the thoughts of our enemies.

644
01:00:10,463 --> 01:00:12,260
Yes, Sir.

645
01:00:12,531 --> 01:00:17,468
- That was you?
- Yes, that's right, sir.

646
01:00:19,438 --> 01:00:21,531
You're a man most wanted Iraqis.

647
01:00:21,574 --> 01:00:24,372
There are 180 thousand dollar reward
above your head. Congratulations.

648
01:00:24,377 --> 01:00:27,471
Do not tell my wife.
He might fill my head.

649
01:00:28,481 --> 01:00:32,508
Do you want to form a team
to hunt Butchers?

650
01:00:32,518 --> 01:00:34,315
Yes, Sir.

651
01:00:35,354 --> 01:00:38,380
There is intelligence that indicates
area of operation.

652
01:00:38,491 --> 01:00:42,427
I want you to kill him.

653
01:00:43,362 --> 01:00:44,488
Find him.

654
01:00:45,364 --> 01:00:46,388
Yes, Sir.

655
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:50,435
Okay, let's get him.

656
01:00:51,504 --> 01:00:54,302
Clean up all before going.

657
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:56,365
- In action together with the legend.
-What?

658
01:00:56,375 --> 01:00:59,469
- The legend.
-will Tell you another time.

659
01:00:59,478 --> 01:01:02,379
- You're great, man.
- Thank you.

660
01:01:02,415 --> 01:01:04,349
What would you say?

661
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:07,319
Gospels is bulletproof?

662
01:01:07,353 --> 01:01:11,449
- It?
- Yes, I have never seen you open it.

663
01:01:13,492 --> 01:01:16,359
We must honor God, right?

664
01:01:17,396 --> 01:01:18,454
You have a God?

665
01:01:20,433 --> 01:01:22,458
Why not?

666
01:01:25,371 --> 01:01:28,340
When I was a kid there was a fence
electricity near our house.

667
01:01:28,374 --> 01:01:31,241
Children trying to touch
and the most enduring.

668
01:01:32,344 --> 01:01:34,369
War like that.

669
01:01:35,281 --> 01:01:38,444
You must hold on tightly.

670
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:42,480
You want to get out of the team?

671
01:01:44,323 --> 01:01:45,517
I just wanted to believe what we are doing.

672
01:01:45,558 --> 01:01:48,254
We're chasing bad guys.

673
01:01:49,361 --> 01:01:51,352
Yes, there are bad people everywhere.

674
01:01:51,363 --> 01:01:54,457
You want them to come to
San Diego or New York?

675
01:01:55,434 --> 01:01:58,301
We are not only protecting the sandy soil.

676
01:01:59,538 --> 01:02:04,271
Ok. Let us kill him.

677
01:02:14,487 --> 01:02:20,323
I was in the building next to the East
facing restaurant.

678
01:02:22,495 --> 01:02:25,293
Log In. Come on.

679
01:02:27,299 --> 01:02:28,391
Safe.

680
01:02:49,388 --> 01:02:52,380
- Get down.
- Okay, okay.

681
01:02:52,424 --> 01:02:55,325
Put your hands behind your head.

682
01:03:01,534 --> 01:03:05,334
Target looks.
I watched the window, Chris.

683
01:03:05,404 --> 01:03:07,395
- Create a safe limit.
- Well, let's get ready.

684
01:03:07,439 --> 01:03:09,373
On the corner.

685
01:03:09,375 --> 01:03:11,434
Let's move to another room.

686
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,313
Your wife know? Do you know this man?

687
01:03:20,419 --> 01:03:22,387
She said she did not know.

688
01:03:22,555 --> 01:03:25,353
How are you, son?
Do you know this face?

689
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:28,392
Are you sure?

690
01:03:29,528 --> 01:03:33,362
Should you tell them
do not go until we go.

691
01:03:37,303 --> 01:03:41,296
Hey, keep an eye window, make sure you
taking pictures of all the incoming and outgoing.

692
01:03:59,458 --> 01:04:01,426
What we can?

693
01:04:02,494 --> 01:04:05,395
16 military agents entered.

694
01:04:05,431 --> 01:04:09,458
- 16?
- Yes, they serve many customers.

695
01:04:10,502 --> 01:04:13,266
Look at this.

696
01:04:17,476 --> 01:04:20,536
- He's still there?
- He had just entered.

697
01:04:21,313 --> 01:04:24,476
- He's in there,
but it is not easy to reach.
-I Do not know about it.

698
01:04:25,317 --> 01:04:30,277
They see the legend entry, he like
celebrities, ask for his autograph?

699
01:04:30,422 --> 01:04:32,413
They're partying?

700
01:04:32,524 --> 01:04:35,357
Hey, I do not promote myself.

701
01:04:35,394 --> 01:04:38,261
True, I did it for you.

702
01:04:38,264 --> 01:04:42,394
- You're not going to be the head
if it were not for us.
- True.

703
01:04:48,474 --> 01:04:52,308
He invites you to
dinner ldul Adha.

704
01:04:52,444 --> 01:04:55,504
He said on this day everything
should sit down and eat with him.

705
01:04:56,548 --> 01:04:59,312
He was really sweet.

706
01:05:14,533 --> 01:05:19,266
Cucumber was put here?

707
01:05:19,271 --> 01:05:22,263
Yes I Do. This chili.

708
01:05:22,274 --> 01:05:24,367
Soaked overnight.

709
01:05:24,410 --> 01:05:26,378
Then just add vodka.

710
01:05:26,412 --> 01:05:30,371
- That's the point.
- Just do it.

711
01:05:30,416 --> 01:05:33,283
Good, the food is delicious.

712
01:05:36,355 --> 01:05:38,414
That's a good question.

713
01:05:38,457 --> 01:05:40,425
All these people.

714
01:05:49,335 --> 01:05:52,270
Oh My.

715
01:06:01,513 --> 01:06:04,380
You will eat with your left hand?

716
01:06:04,516 --> 01:06:06,450
Come On.

717
01:06:06,485 --> 01:06:09,283
I want to wash your hands.

718
01:06:13,292 --> 01:06:15,351
Hey.

719
01:07:24,563 --> 01:07:27,396
He is clean.

720
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,265
Hey!

721
01:07:30,502 --> 01:07:33,335
- Check it.
- Do not go anywhere.

722
01:07:33,405 --> 01:07:35,339
- Hey, what is this?
- Beagles,

723
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:37,240
Chill Out.

724
01:07:39,278 --> 01:07:41,269
Look at that?

725
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:44,278
- Did you see?
-What Is wrong?

726
01:07:44,283 --> 01:07:46,274
- Bring the tarp.
-Oh My.

727
01:07:48,487 --> 01:07:52,423
Well, you tell him that
he will go to jail,

728
01:07:52,491 --> 01:07:55,358
in lraq, they know what
that will be done to him,

729
01:07:55,427 --> 01:07:57,520
or he can help us
search for the man in the restaurant.

730
01:07:58,297 --> 01:08:00,288
Tell him, it's his choice.

731
01:08:32,364 --> 01:08:34,389
That's him.

732
01:08:35,334 --> 01:08:37,393
Safe.

733
01:08:37,469 --> 01:08:39,437
Good, let's move it.

734
01:08:43,275 --> 01:08:45,266
Southern team ready.

735
01:08:48,413 --> 01:08:50,472
Right-ready security.

736
01:08:50,482 --> 01:08:52,507
He moves.

737
01:09:06,465 --> 01:09:08,456
15 meters.

738
01:09:11,503 --> 01:09:13,437
10 meters.

739
01:09:16,475 --> 01:09:18,375
5 meters.

740
01:09:26,518 --> 01:09:28,486
He knocked.

741
01:09:33,292 --> 01:09:35,283
Wait.

742
01:09:35,394 --> 01:09:37,453
They open it.

743
01:09:39,331 --> 01:09:41,458
I shoot.

744
01:09:41,466 --> 01:09:43,400
Forward.

745
01:09:50,409 --> 01:09:52,400
Forward!

746
01:10:00,519 --> 01:10:02,487
Beagles, nothing out of the back?

747
01:10:02,521 --> 01:10:04,512
No, he did not move.

748
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,298
- D, put him down.
- Okay.

749
01:10:20,405 --> 01:10:22,430
Put him down.

750
01:10:26,545 --> 01:10:29,480
We find something,
carefully, remain vigilant.

751
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:34,317
Enemies come!

752
01:10:37,556 --> 01:10:40,286
Back Off!

753
01:10:43,295 --> 01:10:45,456
The outer side of security!

754
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:07,318
Get down!

755
01:11:27,372 --> 01:11:29,431
That's them!

756
01:11:38,383 --> 01:11:40,442
Butchers stir.

757
01:11:40,485 --> 01:11:42,544
3 Butchers move, I'm chasing.

758
01:11:53,398 --> 01:11:56,299
Butchers shot, to your position.

759
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:21,291
We've told him, that is her choice.

760
01:12:21,326 --> 01:12:24,352
He chose the wrong side, it's his choice.

761
01:12:26,565 --> 01:12:30,524
Hey, Chris, Clean up all, we
go, things got messed up.

762
01:12:31,269 --> 01:12:33,499
Sir, there are here, we have to make a trail.

763
01:12:33,538 --> 01:12:35,506
Good work, Richie.

764
01:13:19,451 --> 01:13:22,420
- You want more?
- See what this is.

765
01:13:22,454 --> 01:13:25,252
You can be the object was given,
The way it works.

766
01:13:25,257 --> 01:13:27,248
You can not get that one.

767
01:13:27,292 --> 01:13:28,486
This.

768
01:13:37,335 --> 01:13:40,395
- That's great.
-Come On, we're ready.

769
01:13:40,405 --> 01:13:43,272
- You can raise it.
- Troops ready.

770
01:13:43,275 --> 01:13:45,505
That's not possible.

771
01:13:45,544 --> 01:13:48,274
Okay, interesting.

772
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:50,441
- That's for you.
- Okay.

773
01:13:51,283 --> 01:13:53,478
What? Take from the floor.

774
01:13:53,518 --> 01:13:56,248
Come take.

775
01:13:56,254 --> 01:13:58,347
- Put that it's here.
- Excuse me, Sir.

776
01:13:58,390 --> 01:14:00,255
- See?
- This is it.

777
01:14:00,292 --> 01:14:01,418
Purple.

778
01:14:01,426 --> 01:14:04,259
- You're Chief Chris Kyle?
- Yes, Sir?

779
01:14:04,563 --> 01:14:09,296
My name ments, you saved my life.

780
01:14:11,303 --> 01:14:13,396
- Is It True?
- Yes I Do.

781
01:14:14,339 --> 01:14:18,469
We were stuck in the house, until you come
with force, you are bringing us out.

782
01:14:19,444 --> 01:14:21,503
Marines often save us.

783
01:14:21,513 --> 01:14:23,481
-How Are you? You are okay?
- Okay.

784
01:14:24,449 --> 01:14:27,418
I'm just thankful I'm alive.

785
01:14:27,452 --> 01:14:30,250
- That's not ...
- Oh.

786
01:14:30,288 --> 01:14:33,280
Not easy, well you know.

787
01:14:35,427 --> 01:14:38,260
I was lucky to only lose one leg.

788
01:14:39,297 --> 01:14:41,356
- Your friends are also lost?
- Yes, they also.

789
01:14:41,366 --> 01:14:45,302
But I'm talking about people who
still alive, they managed to come back.

790
01:14:45,337 --> 01:14:48,306
- They can not seem to live a normal life.
- Yes I Do.

791
01:14:50,509 --> 01:14:53,535
Why did not you come to our place?
They will be happy.

792
01:14:54,412 --> 01:14:57,279
They want to know about you.

793
01:14:57,549 --> 01:15:00,347
- Yes, it seems like a good idea.
- Hey, friend.

794
01:15:02,354 --> 01:15:04,447
Can I tell?

795
01:15:04,523 --> 01:15:07,492
Your father ... A hero.

796
01:15:09,361 --> 01:15:12,558
True. He saved my life, and he ...

797
01:15:13,465 --> 01:15:15,524
He could go back to his son.

798
01:15:15,534 --> 01:15:18,367
So, thank you
lend it to us.

799
01:15:18,403 --> 01:15:21,395
- Ok.
-I Will not be here
if not for him.

800
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:30,473
My family is grateful for your services.

801
01:15:32,417 --> 01:15:34,544
Okay, thanks. Okay.

802
01:15:35,287 --> 01:15:37,278
- Take care of you.
- Nice to see you again.

803
01:15:37,289 --> 01:15:38,483
- Okay.
- Sometime stop by the VA.

804
01:15:38,523 --> 01:15:42,289
Ok. Okay. Take kadalmu.

805
01:15:45,297 --> 01:15:47,390
- Thank you. Have a nice day.
- You are welcome.

806
01:15:47,432 --> 01:15:49,366
- Have a nice day.
- Ok.

807
01:15:49,401 --> 01:15:51,494
- See you.
-Come We find your sister.

808
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:24,495
Hey, sorry, it's time.

809
01:16:28,306 --> 01:16:31,298
That's my daughter, I think you're
should pay attention to him.

810
01:16:31,343 --> 01:16:33,311
Excuse Me.

811
01:16:34,446 --> 01:16:37,313
Hey! Hey, where are you going?

812
01:16:37,482 --> 01:16:39,382
Hey!

813
01:16:39,417 --> 01:16:41,408
Hey! Please note my son.

814
01:16:43,388 --> 01:16:45,288
Hey!

815
01:16:48,293 --> 01:16:51,262
Hey! Please note my son now!

816
01:16:54,299 --> 01:16:56,563
I make my own memory.

817
01:16:58,536 --> 01:17:01,300
I can not share it with anyone.

818
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:04,501
Well, it is.

819
01:17:07,545 --> 01:17:10,275
When did it begin?

820
01:17:10,515 --> 01:17:13,450
Even when you're here,
you're not here.

821
01:17:14,386 --> 01:17:17,355
I see you, I feel you.

822
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:20,515
But you're not here.

823
01:17:37,475 --> 01:17:39,534
I hate that team.

824
01:17:41,513 --> 01:17:43,481
True.

825
01:17:43,481 --> 01:17:45,472
You're my husband.

826
01:17:45,483 --> 01:17:49,249
You're the father of my children, but
instead they are the reason you get back.

827
01:17:55,427 --> 01:17:58,453
They can not wait,
wealso can not.

828
01:18:03,535 --> 01:18:07,232
If you think this war is not
change you, you're wrong.

829
01:18:10,341 --> 01:18:12,502
You can just walk in circles.

830
01:18:24,389 --> 01:18:26,414
That's true.

831
01:18:43,308 --> 01:18:45,538
This Cadillac 31 we are
follow courier Butcher,

832
01:18:45,543 --> 01:18:48,410
we're on the road Marylin, replace.

833
01:18:49,347 --> 01:18:51,440
Hey, you can ring.

834
01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:55,513
- Where from? From here?
- Yes, it's cheaper here.

835
01:18:56,421 --> 01:18:59,447
You buy it from the collector? how Do
you know there is no blood in the ring?

836
01:18:59,491 --> 01:19:04,258
What do you care? You do a lot of killing
here, you legend.

837
01:19:04,295 --> 01:19:07,389
- Not to ring.
-what Is the problem?

838
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:11,333
- It's hypocritical.
- Slowly.

839
01:19:11,336 --> 01:19:13,304
- Do not get too close.
- Okay, you tell him.

840
01:19:13,304 --> 01:19:17,240
- You tell him where did you get it?
- Of course not, I would say
I bought elsewhere.

841
01:19:19,544 --> 01:19:21,535
Are you still with us?

842
01:19:21,546 --> 01:19:25,312
Half a block in the back.
We are ready.

843
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:27,518
You know, D ...

844
01:19:27,519 --> 01:19:30,386
My guess is 20 years away at the reunion.

845
01:19:31,322 --> 01:19:33,415
You will marry a man.

846
01:19:33,491 --> 01:19:36,289
As long as she can cook and clean.

847
01:19:44,536 --> 01:19:47,334
- That's them.
-Oh My.

848
01:19:48,473 --> 01:19:50,373
They got people all over the city.

849
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:53,367
They are the Al-Qaeda-like everything.

850
01:20:10,261 --> 01:20:13,230
Hey, next time if you can
shoot, not to fail, right?

851
01:20:13,298 --> 01:20:16,392
I'm into the alley to save.

852
01:20:44,429 --> 01:20:48,263
- So, you're going to be my companion?
- Who else?

853
01:20:48,299 --> 01:20:50,460
There is only one companion.

854
01:20:57,275 --> 01:20:59,300
Beacon 1're fired!

855
01:20:59,377 --> 01:21:01,402
-Come On, give me a shot of protection.
- Okay.

856
01:21:21,532 --> 01:21:23,523
Let's move.

857
01:21:28,539 --> 01:21:30,439
Safe.

858
01:21:30,541 --> 01:21:33,339
Come with me.

859
01:21:44,555 --> 01:21:48,389
We saw them. Bacon safe.

860
01:21:48,459 --> 01:21:50,484
Prepare security, Chris.

861
01:21:51,362 --> 01:21:53,296
Well ...

862
01:21:53,331 --> 01:21:55,299
Secure roof.

863
01:21:55,533 --> 01:21:59,492
You're not afraid he would
release after she know?

864
01:22:00,538 --> 01:22:03,371
Do Not.
Prepare security.

865
01:22:03,408 --> 01:22:06,241
- Now I'm a little concerned.
- It should.

866
01:22:06,277 --> 01:22:08,404
You mean she could keep track of diamonds?

867
01:22:08,413 --> 01:22:10,438
I think so.

868
01:22:12,517 --> 01:22:15,384
You are okay?

869
01:22:21,459 --> 01:22:23,359
There were shot, Beagles shot.

870
01:22:23,394 --> 01:22:25,362
Northwest corner, on top of the roof.

871
01:22:29,567 --> 01:22:31,535
Hang in there.

872
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:38,338
I need a medical today.

873
01:22:48,519 --> 01:22:51,454
Okay, we'll pick you up
and bring you down.

874
01:22:54,525 --> 01:22:56,459
Come on.

875
01:23:10,308 --> 01:23:12,503
Come on, put him into the Humvee.

876
01:23:13,411 --> 01:23:15,402
-Angkat Him.
- Ok.

877
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,505
Fast.

878
01:23:20,451 --> 01:23:22,476
Come on, get in. Hang in there, Beagles.

879
01:23:23,287 --> 01:23:25,312
Hang in there, Beagles.

880
01:23:25,356 --> 01:23:27,381
Hang in there, Beagles.

881
01:23:30,294 --> 01:23:32,455
- Chill Out.
- I am sorry.

882
01:23:32,463 --> 01:23:34,488
What for? Why are you apologizing?

883
01:23:34,499 --> 01:23:37,400
- That was my fault, we go up to the roof.
-I Will die?

884
01:23:37,535 --> 01:23:40,299
No, Beagles. You Frogman.

885
01:23:40,304 --> 01:23:43,432
Frogman not die.
He will put the sand in the wound,

886
01:23:43,508 --> 01:23:47,274
and entered the water, you're fine, Beagles.
Hang in there.

887
01:23:47,278 --> 01:23:50,247
Hey, Chris. Make sure he can ring it, okay?

888
01:23:50,314 --> 01:23:52,282
Sure.

889
01:23:56,287 --> 01:23:58,448
Raise suction.

890
01:23:59,323 --> 01:24:01,518
Blood again.
How much longer?

891
01:24:01,526 --> 01:24:05,292
We need 3 units of blood.

892
01:24:05,396 --> 01:24:06,454
The Current.

893
01:24:06,497 --> 01:24:09,261
- Vacuum.
- Put it here.

894
01:24:09,333 --> 01:24:11,460
Press firmly!

895
01:24:12,270 --> 01:24:14,261
Her blood less quickly.

896
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:24,405
Did you see the shooter?

897
01:24:24,515 --> 01:24:27,313
No, the distance is 1000 meters more.

898
01:24:27,452 --> 01:24:30,353
No one can shoot that far.

899
01:24:31,556 --> 01:24:35,356
- She will survive?
- He is being treated.

900
01:24:36,327 --> 01:24:39,421
- That's not good.
- He was shot in the vitals.

901
01:24:40,398 --> 01:24:42,332
Fuck!

902
01:24:43,334 --> 01:24:47,270
We have to find that person.

903
01:24:47,338 --> 01:24:50,307
The unit is still looking for that person.

904
01:24:50,374 --> 01:24:52,535
I understand if you do not
would continue and gather.

905
01:24:52,543 --> 01:24:55,307
Up to you.

906
01:24:55,379 --> 01:24:57,438
You're the leader.

907
01:24:57,515 --> 01:25:00,348
Eye to eye.

908
01:25:04,455 --> 01:25:06,514
We will be back.

909
01:25:06,557 --> 01:25:09,355
- Nice One.
- Of course.

910
01:25:09,427 --> 01:25:11,361
Come on.

911
01:25:12,396 --> 01:25:14,364
I am coming along.

912
01:25:43,394 --> 01:25:45,362
Hey!

913
01:25:47,532 --> 01:25:49,523
2 kilometers to the south.

914
01:26:19,363 --> 01:26:21,490
On the left.

915
01:26:25,269 --> 01:26:27,430
Hallway.

916
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,533
Safe hallway.
On the left.

917
01:26:33,444 --> 01:26:35,469
Safe.

918
01:26:35,513 --> 01:26:38,277
Everything is safe.

919
01:26:41,452 --> 01:26:43,443
Everything is safe.

920
01:26:44,322 --> 01:26:47,348
Mark, there seems to be a rush to go.

921
01:26:54,465 --> 01:26:57,457
- Get down!
- Stay away from windows!

922
01:26:58,302 --> 01:27:00,361
Stay away from windows!

923
01:27:11,282 --> 01:27:12,442
Come on, Mark.

924
01:27:14,552 --> 01:27:17,350
Come on, friends. I got you.

925
01:27:17,355 --> 01:27:19,380
Look at me.

926
01:27:20,458 --> 01:27:22,392
I'm here.

927
01:27:31,435 --> 01:27:33,460
Mark died, bro.

928
01:27:35,373 --> 01:27:37,534
There were shot, I need help immediately.

929
01:27:38,409 --> 01:27:40,468
We have to move it.

930
01:27:48,552 --> 01:27:54,491
Victory, some people after him,
and some people stumble.

931
01:27:55,359 --> 01:27:57,418
Did not expect to find them.

932
01:27:57,528 --> 01:28:00,497
But everyone ...

933
01:28:00,531 --> 01:28:04,262
good people stumble.
My question is ...

934
01:28:04,368 --> 01:28:08,429
When did it disappear victory
and into safety?

935
01:28:09,273 --> 01:28:11,400
Or then it becomes ...

936
01:28:11,442 --> 01:28:15,435
Who spent one I ...

937
01:28:16,514 --> 01:28:19,312
Love in the war.

938
01:28:19,450 --> 01:28:21,441
And I saw ...

939
01:28:23,454 --> 01:28:26,389
Preparing!

940
01:28:27,458 --> 01:28:29,483
Lift arms!

941
01:28:30,528 --> 01:28:33,429
Ready! Aim!

942
01:28:34,365 --> 01:28:36,333
Shoot!

943
01:28:36,334 --> 01:28:38,268
Ready!

944
01:28:38,269 --> 01:28:40,533
Aim! Shoot!

945
01:28:41,305 --> 01:28:43,535
Ready! Aim!

946
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:48,368
Shoot! Lower arms.

947
01:29:42,433 --> 01:29:44,492
Mark wrote the letter two weeks ago.

948
01:29:47,471 --> 01:29:50,338
He told you?

949
01:29:58,382 --> 01:30:01,317
Chris, I want to know what
you think about the letter.

950
01:30:02,486 --> 01:30:06,320
Eating cold night, and ...

951
01:30:06,490 --> 01:30:11,393
Beagles just been shot,
and we were ambushed.

952
01:30:12,329 --> 01:30:14,456
But, is not that strange.

953
01:30:15,533 --> 01:30:18,331
The letter was killed Mark.

954
01:30:18,402 --> 01:30:22,338
He just ... he died,
and he paid the price.

955
01:30:33,484 --> 01:30:35,452
Signature here.

956
01:30:46,363 --> 01:30:48,331
Hey, friend.

957
01:30:48,332 --> 01:30:50,357
- Chris?
- Yes I Do.

958
01:30:50,367 --> 01:30:52,426
-How Are you?
-I'm Here.

959
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:55,371
- Damn, you're blind as a bat.
- Yes, the bullet jerk.

960
01:30:56,373 --> 01:30:58,341
They said they would
fix my face.

961
01:30:58,375 --> 01:31:01,435
Fortunately, we let
them to fix it.

962
01:31:01,445 --> 01:31:03,310
Seriously.

963
01:31:03,447 --> 01:31:05,540
- Too fast?
- Too fast.

964
01:31:05,549 --> 01:31:08,518
- Hey, I heard you apply.
- Yes I Do.

965
01:31:08,552 --> 01:31:10,520
Congratulations.

966
01:31:10,521 --> 01:31:12,489
You did not tell him
you buy a diamond that

967
01:31:12,523 --> 01:31:15,287
- In that place, is not it?
- Do Not.

968
01:31:15,292 --> 01:31:17,419
- Do Not?
- Do Not. I bought a new one.

969
01:31:18,462 --> 01:31:21,397
- The smaller, and she likes.
- Nice One.

970
01:31:21,432 --> 01:31:23,423
- Yes I Do.
- Nice One.

971
01:31:24,268 --> 01:31:26,361
He will not leave me, bro.

972
01:31:28,305 --> 01:31:30,398
I told him to go, he did not want to.

973
01:31:31,408 --> 01:31:34,241
He wants to be with me.

974
01:31:34,545 --> 01:31:36,536
Why do you say that?

975
01:31:36,547 --> 01:31:39,311
Do not say that, he loves you.

976
01:31:41,352 --> 01:31:44,321
- He was in love with you.
- Are you kidding.

977
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:49,282
Yes, I'm glad I have it.

978
01:31:49,393 --> 01:31:52,385
-I Know you can handle it.
- Maybe you're right.

979
01:31:53,497 --> 01:31:57,297
They said you were the most lethal sniper
in American military history.

980
01:31:57,334 --> 01:31:59,461
- Is It True?
- That's what I heard.

981
01:32:01,539 --> 01:32:04,406
- You heard them say that?
- Yes I Do.

982
01:32:04,441 --> 01:32:07,376
- You're not going back.
- Yes, we will hunt him down.

983
01:32:07,411 --> 01:32:10,437
-Ayolah, You do not need to do that.
- We have to do it.

984
01:32:11,282 --> 01:32:14,445
You're my brother, and they have to pay
for what they've done to you.

985
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:19,250
How are you going to do?

986
01:32:19,423 --> 01:32:21,448
There are crazy.

987
01:32:27,331 --> 01:32:29,356
He survived.

988
01:32:29,466 --> 01:32:32,264
He'll be fine.

989
01:32:32,303 --> 01:32:34,396
He did apply.

990
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:39,407
Do you want to die?

991
01:32:39,443 --> 01:32:41,411
If that's what you want.

992
01:32:41,445 --> 01:32:43,413
What?

993
01:32:43,514 --> 01:32:46,278
Tell me.

994
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:50,281
Why did you do it? I want to understand.

995
01:32:50,321 --> 01:32:52,414
I did it for you, I
do it to protect you.

996
01:32:52,423 --> 01:32:54,482
- Do Not.
- Yes I Do.

997
01:32:54,525 --> 01:32:59,394
I'm here. Your family here,
your children, no father.

998
01:32:59,396 --> 01:33:02,490
-I Had to serve my country.
- That's nonsense!

999
01:33:02,499 --> 01:33:05,400
- Do Not.
- You do not know when to stop.

1000
01:33:07,304 --> 01:33:10,535
You've done your job, you're pretty
sacrifice, let someone else have a go.

1001
01:33:10,541 --> 01:33:12,509
- Let someone else go?
- Yes I Do.

1002
01:33:12,543 --> 01:33:15,410
-I Can not live.
- You have to find a way.

1003
01:33:16,313 --> 01:33:18,440
You should do it.

1004
01:33:22,453 --> 01:33:26,412
Ok? I want you to be human again.

1005
01:33:28,492 --> 01:33:31,359
I need you here.

1006
01:33:32,363 --> 01:33:35,298
They need you here.

1007
01:33:37,434 --> 01:33:39,459
If you go again ...

1008
01:33:40,537 --> 01:33:43,404
I guess we will not be there
here when you return.

1009
01:34:10,267 --> 01:34:11,495
Chris.

1010
01:34:12,536 --> 01:34:15,505
We have 3 missions
respectively.

1011
01:34:15,506 --> 01:34:18,475
That would be worse.

1012
01:34:18,509 --> 01:34:21,478
- It will be chaotic.
- Are you coming?

1013
01:34:21,512 --> 01:34:23,480
I think so.

1014
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:26,381
His wife scolded him.

1015
01:34:26,383 --> 01:34:31,252
Once again my wife
will kill me.

1016
01:34:31,255 --> 01:34:33,485
- True.
- They do not understand.

1017
01:34:33,524 --> 01:34:37,551
I went to the hospital
previously, it was bad.

1018
01:34:38,395 --> 01:34:40,386
He was already dead, Chris.

1019
01:34:41,398 --> 01:34:45,528
He was operated on yesterday,
died on the operating table.

1020
01:34:53,343 --> 01:34:57,279
It Taya, leave a message.

1021
01:34:57,314 --> 01:35:00,283
It's me, just want
hear your voice.

1022
01:35:02,319 --> 01:35:05,345
I think it
are you saying ...

1023
01:35:05,422 --> 01:35:08,289
I told you kids
love them.

1024
01:35:08,325 --> 01:35:10,384
I love you too.

1025
01:36:35,412 --> 01:36:37,471
Put.

1026
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:53,257
Come On.

1027
01:37:20,524 --> 01:37:27,293
Listen, they believe this will
can help us win the war.

1028
01:37:27,331 --> 01:37:32,428
The problem engineers designed so as not to
can be defeated by a sniper.

1029
01:37:32,436 --> 01:37:33,528
In Which?

1030
01:37:34,371 --> 01:37:37,431
- Approximately 100 miles.
-There Is something else?

1031
01:37:37,474 --> 01:37:40,409
-I Do not know.
- Snipers will kill us.

1032
01:37:40,444 --> 01:37:43,538
He was either anyone.
We just have to kill him.

1033
01:37:43,547 --> 01:37:49,349
We've blocked 6 blocks from the North region
enemy, you will be in front of the shooter jitunya.

1034
01:37:49,386 --> 01:37:52,480
- In the middle of the desert storm?
- Bring your sunglasses.

1035
01:37:52,522 --> 01:37:56,424
We must kill the sniper.
Understand?

1036
01:37:56,426 --> 01:38:00,419
- Be prepared.
- Yes, Sir.

1037
01:40:05,455 --> 01:40:10,290
-Safe.
- Going down. Come on.

1038
01:40:10,394 --> 01:40:11,554
Come on.

1039
01:40:16,433 --> 01:40:19,493
Safe. The Way.

1040
01:40:22,539 --> 01:40:26,339
Everything is safe.
The building is safe.

1041
01:41:05,348 --> 01:41:08,511
No one came.
Hold fire.

1042
01:41:17,527 --> 01:41:20,496
In the middle of a desert storm.

1043
01:41:59,503 --> 01:42:02,404
-Watch Out!
- Take cover!

1044
01:42:05,275 --> 01:42:09,302
Shit. The shot of the East.

1045
01:42:14,451 --> 01:42:17,420
We are in the wrong position.

1046
01:42:18,488 --> 01:42:23,425
Not important. Hold fire.
There are people below us.

1047
01:42:55,425 --> 01:42:58,326
There is a target at 19 yards.

1048
01:42:58,328 --> 01:43:02,389
I can not see that far.
Hold fire. We could get caught.

1049
01:43:02,432 --> 01:43:05,265
He's right, there's no point.

1050
01:43:05,268 --> 01:43:08,294
Correction, 21 yards.

1051
01:43:09,372 --> 01:43:12,307
More than 1 mile.
Impossible to shoot, Chris.

1052
01:43:24,354 --> 01:43:26,322
That's him.

1053
01:43:27,457 --> 01:43:31,518
I've got
target, change.

1054
01:43:31,528 --> 01:43:35,362
Understandably, the troops will
soon arrived within 20 minutes.

1055
01:43:50,413 --> 01:43:53,473
- He oversees our friends.
- Can you confirm?

1056
01:43:56,453 --> 01:43:58,478
That's him.

1057
01:43:59,289 --> 01:44:02,349
- That's him.
- Your decision, Chris.

1058
01:44:02,392 --> 01:44:06,328
The team will arrive within 20 minutes.
Hold fire.

1059
01:44:18,541 --> 01:44:21,305
You have to kill him.

1060
01:44:23,313 --> 01:44:26,282
This is very important.

1061
01:44:26,483 --> 01:44:28,542
I will do.

1062
01:45:02,452 --> 01:45:04,511
He screwed us.

1063
01:45:06,556 --> 01:45:10,458
- Tango fall.
- We need help.

1064
01:45:14,497 --> 01:45:19,264
- Mission accomplished.
- He oversees our people.

1065
01:45:19,302 --> 01:45:23,398
- Kill him.
- Yes, now we are stuck.

1066
01:45:26,276 --> 01:45:28,369
He would be proud.

1067
01:45:29,512 --> 01:45:32,310
You did it, Chris.

1068
01:45:33,516 --> 01:45:37,452
Echo 7, there are near you.

1069
01:45:37,454 --> 01:45:40,389
White Side, damn.

1070
01:45:40,423 --> 01:45:42,516
Yes, let's go.

1071
01:45:48,498 --> 01:45:54,528
We will come down from the roof.
Saving your ammunition.

1072
01:45:58,508 --> 01:46:02,342
Fast attack!

1073
01:46:11,287 --> 01:46:15,417
Fast ride!

1074
01:46:46,289 --> 01:46:48,416
Shelter!

1075
01:46:53,363 --> 01:46:56,457
Echo 7, no weapons
The Green Side.

1076
01:47:38,274 --> 01:47:43,405
We fired, White Side!

1077
01:47:51,454 --> 01:47:54,321
We have to move!

1078
01:47:54,357 --> 01:47:56,518
Do not stop shooting!

1079
01:47:57,494 --> 01:47:59,553
They will come.

1080
01:48:10,573 --> 01:48:13,542
- Where Is?
-Arah 3 hours.

1081
01:48:13,543 --> 01:48:16,376
Only the remaining 1 clip.

1082
01:48:16,379 --> 01:48:19,371
Hang in there!
Anyone have any ammunition?

1083
01:48:19,415 --> 01:48:21,542
We can not hold any longer.
We have to move!

1084
01:48:21,551 --> 01:48:25,282
- They stuck.
- We're heading down the road.

1085
01:48:25,288 --> 01:48:27,381
Right, let's go.

1086
01:48:28,291 --> 01:48:31,454
- Call them.
- We need help.

1087
01:48:31,461 --> 01:48:35,329
Coordinates 70,837,575.

1088
01:48:35,331 --> 01:48:39,392
- That's your position.
-I Know, drop it!

1089
01:48:39,435 --> 01:48:42,302
Viper 34, ready to attack.

1090
01:48:42,372 --> 01:48:45,500
Viper 34, replace.
30 sec.

1091
01:48:56,519 --> 01:48:58,419
Hello?

1092
01:48:59,522 --> 01:49:01,387
Dear?

1093
01:49:01,391 --> 01:49:06,328
Chris? Love me
can not hear.

1094
01:49:06,496 --> 01:49:08,521
I am ready.

1095
01:49:09,432 --> 01:49:11,491
I'm ready to go home.

1096
01:49:11,501 --> 01:49:13,298
What?

1097
01:49:19,509 --> 01:49:21,374
What happened?

1098
01:49:23,413 --> 01:49:26,314
I'm ready to go home, dear.

1099
01:49:26,482 --> 01:49:28,347
Chris?

1100
01:49:30,553 --> 01:49:34,250
Here is the danger.
I can not last long.

1101
01:49:34,290 --> 01:49:38,351
- Command pilot shoot.
- Viper 34, gunshot.

1102
01:49:43,266 --> 01:49:44,460
Misses.

1103
01:49:47,337 --> 01:49:48,531
Shit.

1104
01:49:50,273 --> 01:49:54,300
We have to move,
come on, quickly!

1105
01:49:58,348 --> 01:50:00,509
We have to move!

1106
01:50:08,424 --> 01:50:11,416
Echo 7, where are you?

1107
01:50:15,264 --> 01:50:19,291
We attack attack!

1108
01:50:20,403 --> 01:50:22,303
Down!

1109
01:50:22,538 --> 01:50:26,406
Come on! Fast!

1110
01:50:42,425 --> 01:50:44,450
The last person!

1111
01:50:58,274 --> 01:51:02,335
Let's get together!

1112
01:51:03,346 --> 01:51:05,405
Fast!

1113
01:51:16,459 --> 01:51:23,331
- Hurry up!
- Up to the truck!

1114
01:51:35,445 --> 01:51:41,281
-Come On, we have to go!
- Let me help you, come on!

1115
01:51:42,452 --> 01:51:44,420
The Way!

1116
01:51:44,454 --> 01:51:48,413
Where is Chris?
He had been behind us.

1117
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:53,293
Open the door.

1118
01:51:56,432 --> 01:51:59,265
Stop the truck!

1119
01:52:01,370 --> 01:52:05,238
Chris! Come on!

1120
01:52:05,274 --> 01:52:08,300
Come on, quickly!

1121
01:52:08,344 --> 01:52:12,280
We will not leave.
Received my hand, come on!

1122
01:52:12,281 --> 01:52:16,513
Chris! Come on, quickly!

1123
01:52:16,552 --> 01:52:21,387
Come ride!

1124
01:53:31,294 --> 01:53:36,493
- Yes I Do?
-I Can message you on the plane?

1125
01:53:36,532 --> 01:53:39,501
Yes I Do. I came home early.

1126
01:53:39,535 --> 01:53:41,503
Really?

1127
01:53:42,305 --> 01:53:44,432
You're in Germany?

1128
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:47,341
Do Not. I'm here.

1129
01:53:48,511 --> 01:53:51,378
Near here.

1130
01:53:51,380 --> 01:53:53,280
You're home?

1131
01:53:53,516 --> 01:53:56,451
What are you doing?

1132
01:54:00,423 --> 01:54:03,290
I think it only took
a minute.

1133
01:54:05,428 --> 01:54:10,456
Chris, children want to meet.
It's been 9 months.

1134
01:54:18,374 --> 01:54:20,535
I'm going home.

1135
01:54:20,543 --> 01:54:22,477
You are okay?

1136
01:54:23,379 --> 01:54:25,313
Yes I Do.

1137
01:54:28,451 --> 01:54:31,284
Unfortunately, go home.

1138
01:54:31,420 --> 01:54:34,389
We miss you.

1139
01:54:36,559 --> 01:54:38,527
Ok.

1140
01:55:19,402 --> 01:55:23,361
Chris? Dear?

1141
01:55:29,512 --> 01:55:33,346
I'm going out.

1142
01:55:40,356 --> 01:55:42,517
Come on, higher.

1143
01:55:42,558 --> 01:55:45,527
See your face, dear.

1144
01:55:45,561 --> 01:55:49,395
Nice One.
Look different.

1145
01:55:50,333 --> 01:55:52,460
The game Tuesday.

1146
01:55:52,501 --> 01:55:56,460
He will be in the team.
That would be great.

1147
01:55:56,472 --> 01:55:59,339
Crazy, right?

1148
01:55:59,442 --> 01:56:05,472
I was so mad when
see other children.

1149
01:56:06,449 --> 01:56:09,384
You was either a coach.

1150
01:56:12,288 --> 01:56:16,349
He would lose the tooth,
I was a little worried.

1151
01:56:16,392 --> 01:56:18,519
He says only you
which may be pulled.

1152
01:56:18,527 --> 01:56:20,518
You want to do it?

1153
01:56:38,381 --> 01:56:40,440
Chris?

1154
01:56:54,463 --> 01:56:58,331
I can phone
draw from your wife.

1155
01:56:58,334 --> 01:57:00,461
She stories about barbecue.

1156
01:57:01,470 --> 01:57:03,438
That's a pity.

1157
01:57:03,472 --> 01:57:07,272
It seems out of control.
You're worried?

1158
01:57:07,276 --> 01:57:08,470
No, sir.

1159
01:57:08,511 --> 01:57:12,379
So you do not worry about that happening?

1160
01:57:12,381 --> 01:57:14,508
No, sir. I do not
anxious about it.

1161
01:57:15,518 --> 01:57:18,351
I want to ask you, Chris.

1162
01:57:18,354 --> 01:57:20,413
How long have you
serve your country?

1163
01:57:21,290 --> 01:57:25,386
- 4 mission, so ...
- Approximately a thousand days?

1164
01:57:25,428 --> 01:57:27,419
Yes, Sir.

1165
01:57:28,264 --> 01:57:35,295
You will be surprised if I tell AL
note you kill more than 160?

1166
01:57:35,538 --> 01:57:42,535
Ever think of doing things
do not want you doing there?

1167
01:57:42,545 --> 01:57:45,309
That's not me.

1168
01:57:45,514 --> 01:57:47,277
Like what you?

1169
01:57:47,283 --> 01:57:51,276
I'm just protecting my friends.
They are trying to kill our soldiers.

1170
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:54,551
I'm willing to die for
protect them.

1171
01:57:57,526 --> 01:58:03,396
The problem I feel sad for
people who could not I save.

1172
01:58:05,334 --> 01:58:10,362
I want to be there,
but I'm here, stop.

1173
01:58:11,474 --> 01:58:14,272
So you want to save
more people?

1174
01:58:15,277 --> 01:58:16,403
Yes, Sir.

1175
01:58:18,280 --> 01:58:21,374
You can go from here.

1176
01:58:21,450 --> 01:58:24,385
There are many soldiers who
must be saved.

1177
01:58:29,425 --> 01:58:33,452
- Want to go strolling?
- Of course.

1178
01:58:33,462 --> 01:58:37,296
All Right. I want to show you something.

1179
01:58:39,502 --> 01:58:45,338
I still smoke, do not get angry,
because it saved my right hand.

1180
01:58:45,341 --> 01:58:46,501
How can?

1181
01:58:46,542 --> 01:58:51,343
When exploded, second
there hands on the steering wheel,

1182
01:58:51,347 --> 01:58:54,441
before exploding, my right hand

1183
01:58:54,483 --> 01:58:59,284
reached for a cigarette and put into my mouth.
When I turned it on ...

1184
01:58:59,288 --> 01:59:04,385
explosion occurred. destroy
all over my left hand.

1185
01:59:04,393 --> 01:59:07,419
I'm lucky to have this.

1186
01:59:07,463 --> 01:59:11,297
My right hand injury,
but still there.

1187
01:59:11,300 --> 01:59:15,327
- And you still smoke?
- Yes I Do.

1188
01:59:21,310 --> 01:59:25,542
Misses. 3 inches to the right.
Come on, you can do better than that.

1189
01:59:26,515 --> 01:59:28,483
3 inches to the right?

1190
01:59:29,418 --> 01:59:31,409
That is quite complicated.

1191
01:59:31,420 --> 01:59:35,413
Vibration shock you.
Unlike shooting paper.

1192
01:59:35,457 --> 01:59:39,518
- You bisajangan confuse me?
- Kenai only target.

1193
01:59:41,363 --> 01:59:43,456

1194
01:59:44,366 --> 01:59:47,426
Shit, as has

1195
01:59:48,504 --> 01:59:51,371
Why did you do it?

1196
01:59:51,407 --> 01:59:55,503
-I Know you've got a family.
-I Heard you collect shoes.

1197
01:59:55,511 --> 01:59:58,503
I see we are the same size.

1198
01:59:58,547 --> 02:00:02,347
Really, why did you do it?

1199
02:00:02,351 --> 02:00:04,478
We look after each other, right?

1200
02:00:04,553 --> 02:00:07,317
Try shooting again.

1201
02:00:08,490 --> 02:00:10,458
Come on, you can.

1202

1203
02:00:19,435 --> 02:00:20,493
Shit.

1204
02:00:21,570 --> 02:00:24,266
Who's the legend now?

1205
02:00:25,274 --> 02:00:28,539
You do not want that title.
Believe.

1206
02:00:33,382 --> 02:00:36,283

Life here is not bad, right?

1211
02:01:14,456 --> 02:01:16,481
He smiled.

1212
02:01:16,558 --> 02:01:19,356
Looks happy.

1213
02:01:19,428 --> 02:01:21,453
Just do a habit.

1214
02:01:24,333 --> 02:01:26,301
Do not think of the other.

1215
02:01:35,544 --> 02:01:38,308
Who is it?

1216
02:01:38,314 --> 02:01:42,410

02:01:46,488 --> 02:01:51,255
- Honey, I'm sorry. What happened?
- No problem.

1219
02:01:53,262 --> 02:01:56,493
You know about it, right?

1220
02:01:57,299 --> 02:01:58,357
Yes I Do.

1221
02:01:58,367 --> 02:02:01,393
That's what we'll do
for the first time.

1222
02:02:01,403 --> 02:02:03,371
All Right.

1223

02:02:06,342 --> 02:02:08,310
Self confidence.

1225
02:02:08,310 --> 02:02:10,471
And do not hesitate.

1226
02:02:11,480 --> 02:02:14,278

1240
02:03:11,340 --> 02:03:13,399
Of course.

1241
