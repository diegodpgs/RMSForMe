PAPA RUDY:
The cavalettis cannot be vertical.

568
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,605
They must be horizontal,
parallel to the walk cable.

569
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,444
- Parallel?
- It won't be pretty

570
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,727
but it will keep the cable from swaying.

571
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,090
And you must use three bolts
on the cavaletti clamps.

572
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,931
Not two. A span this wide

573
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,646
will put tremendous pressure
on the brace plates.

574
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,405
And as you walk,
your weight could crack a bolt.

575
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,681
And wood!

576
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,131

between the wire and the building's struts.

579

That way, when the building breathe,

580
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,484
the wood will break but the wire won't

we have no excuse to be there.

we bring everything up to the roof

PHILIPPE: Annie.

1723
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:20,725
Thank you.

1724
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:22,165
For everything.

1725
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:27,642
I'm glad the towers called you.

1726
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:51,281
That was incredible.

1727
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:53,010
- Just don't do that again.
- No, never.

1728
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:54,286
(LAUGHING)

1729
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:57,161
PHILIPPE: <i>And you remember Guy Tozzoli
from the press conference,</i>

1730
01:53:57,240 --> 01:53:59,527
<i>one of the men
behind the creation of the towers.</i>

1731
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:00,681
<i>He loved the walk,</i>

1732
01:54:00,760 --> 01:54:03,081
<i>and he gave me a pass
to the observation deck</i>

1733
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:04,810
<i>so I could go anytime I wanted.</i>

1734
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:07,966
<i>And I went there many times alone.</i>

1735
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:26,883
<i>I would find myself there,
looking at the void</i>

1736
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:29,247
<i>to see how the thought comes back,</i>

1737
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:30,924
<i>how the feeling returns.</i>

1738
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:51,850
Because it was...

1739
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:55,130
it was a beautiful day.

1740
01:54:56,240 --> 01:54:58,368
And you know this pass I was given.

1741
01:54:58,440 --> 01:55:00,841
Well, these passes,
they have a date on them,

1742
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:01,967
a date when they expire.

1743
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:05,801
But on my pass,
Mr. Tozzoli, he crossed out the date,

1744
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:08,530
and he wrote on it,

1745
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:10,891
"Forever."
