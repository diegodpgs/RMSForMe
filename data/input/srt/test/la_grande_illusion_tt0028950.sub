{3958}{4013}Hey, Halphen... Going to Epernay?
{4018}{4056}- When?|- In half an hour.
{4061}{4107}In your truck?... Give me a ride.
{4109}{4169}- Sure...Josephine?|- Of course!
{4174}{4241}- You're not the only one.|- Big deal!
{4332}{4418}Say, Maréchal...|You have to take up a staff officer.
{4423}{4466}He's picked the wrong time.
{4473}{4536}-Josephine again?|- Yeah, Josephine.
{4541}{4584}Where will all that get you?
{4589}{4636}She'll just have to wait.
{4991}{5054}Liquor kills!|Liquor drives you crazy!
{5061}{5109}The squadron leader drinks it!
{5253}{5325}Captain de Boeldieu.|Staff officer, division...
{5365}{5432}Do you know this photo, Mr. Maréchal?
{5483}{5528}Sure. Ricord took it with me.
{5531}{5593}And where can I find Mr. Ricord?
{5598}{5643}- On leave.|- Of course.
{5658}{5732}This gray smudge worries me...
{5737}{5785}Here, just below the road.
{5787}{5883}- That's not a road, it's a canal.|- No, a railway.
{5888}{5960}Such unanimity|honors our aerial cameras.
{5962}{6001}It was a foggy day.
{6003}{6061}I'd like to resolve this enigma.
{6063}{6128}I'll request a plane.
{6154}{6202}I'll go get ready, sir.
{6228}{6269}Flying suit or fur jacket?
{6274}{6377}No preference.|Flying suits smell, fur jackets shed.
{6382}{6437}Get me the fighter squadron.
{6864}{6933}Take a car to the sugar refinery.
{6957}{7015}I just shot down a Caudron fiighter.
{7020}{7056}If they're Officers,
{7077}{7144}invite them for lunch.
{7403}{7432}Freisler...
{7461}{7540}make us one of your famous|fruit punches
{7552}{7633}to celebrate the downing|of my twelfth plane.
{7693}{7756}Three bottles of Moselle...|two Rhine...
{7777}{7811}half a bottle of Martel...
{7818}{7852}three bubbly...
{7868}{7902}two seltzer...
{7919}{7957}pineapples...
{8053}{8154}Two officers. One is wounded.|I took him to the infirmary.
{8233}{8312}Captain von Rauffenstein,|CO, 21 st Squadron.
{8314}{8358}Captain de Boeldieu, staff officer.
{8420}{8461}Lt. Maréchal, pilot.
{8480}{8513}My apologies.
{8521}{8549}My officers.
{8621}{8691}I am honored to have French guests.
{8703}{8763}Now, gentlemen, let us eat.
{8787}{8832}Orderly, coats!
{9326}{9372}Freisler, your punch...
{9377}{9424}May I serve you?
{9427}{9501}I knew a Boeldieu in Berlin...
{9518}{9552}a Count de Boeldieu.
{9585}{9635}My cousin, Edmond de Boeldieu.
{9640}{9679}He was military attaché.
{9808}{9858}He's a fighter pilot now.
{9873}{9909}Aren't you eating?
{9950}{9993}I can't cut the meat.
{10000}{10050}- May I?|- Please do.
{10062}{10096}You speak good French.
{10115}{10163}I was a mechanic in Lyons.
{10168}{10232}No kidding!|Me too, I'm a mecha...
{10537}{10606}To Captain de Crussol,|French Flying Corps,
{10611}{10652}shotdown in flames...
{10657}{10731}From the Officers|ofthe German 21st Squadron.
{10736}{10798}I'm sorry about this coincidence.
{10918}{11014}May the earth lie lightly|on our valiant enemy.
{11381}{11465}I have orders to take custody|of the captured officers.
{11731}{11824}PRISONER-OF-WAR CAMP N1 7|OFFICERS' CAMP
{12299}{12357}Read these gentlemen|the camp regulations.
{12390}{12513}"Officers will be treated|with the consideration due their rank."
{12517}{12620}"However, you are reminded|that you are subject to German law."
{12623}{12745}"You therefore must obey|the rules of German discipline."
{12757}{12855}"Any German soldier here|has the right to give you orders
{12860}{12923}which must be obeyed without protest."
{12925}{13038}"You must salute Officers|according to German army regulations."
{13042}{13160}"If you attempt to escape,|sentries have orders to fire on officers
{13165}{13208}found outside camp limits."
{13213}{13273}"Incorrect dress is not permitted."
{13309}{13414}" Large crowds are forbidden.|You may not insult the German people,
{13419}{13510}"or write or speak to civilians|from outside the camp."
{13560}{13623}"It is forbidden|to speak to the sentries."
{13769}{13860}Gentlemen, we will now proceed|with some minor formalities.
{14253}{14335}Russian nouns are declined|just like in Latin.
{14529}{14584}- Newcomers.|- Let's warn them.
{14606}{14723}Angel of purity, angel of light!
{14730}{14807}Hide your valuables...
{15047}{15116}- What are they singing?|- To hide our valuables.
{15392}{15445}Don't touch!|Those belong to me.
{15735}{15781}I've got nothing, old man.
{15785}{15840}Had I known,|I'd have brought some cash.
{15989}{16037}This conduct is unbecoming.
{16042}{16121}Sorry, it's our duty to search you.|This is war.
{16126}{16188}I perfectly agree,|but conduct it courteously.
{16193}{16260}If not, I'll see|your commanding officer.
{16536}{16612}How are you - kulele?|Lucky you - calyptus!
{16617}{16699}Here, Müller, have some chocolate.
{16704}{16759}You've no right to open my ham!
{16764}{16835}It's in the regulations.|I read them carefully.
{16852}{16912}It's rotten! You can have it!
{16963}{16996}He's hard to please.
{16998}{17073}I'm delighted when my folks|send a parcel.
{17078}{17133}Here we are,|in the heart of Germany,
{17138}{17197}cut off from our families by the front,
{17202}{17277}and here's a can of peas,|direct from Paris.
{17281}{17313}Is it all right?
{17361}{17466}I'm amazed at how honest|our jailers are with our parcels.
{17473}{17567}It's true!|Take our feldwebel, Arthur...
{17572}{17694}He eats cabbage every day.|It sticks in his craw. He told me so.
{17744}{17818}He'd much rather lay into your peas.
{17835}{17871}Don't kid yourselves.
{17881}{17953}If they did that,|our parcels would stop coming.
{17955}{18029}They're short of food for themselves.
{18032}{18085}Hurry, our guests will be hungry.
{18106}{18204}This tastes like an old sock!
{18209}{18260}What do they feed the French?
{18264}{18339}Cabbage, but they have their parcels.
{18346}{18420}- And the Russians?|- Cabbage roots, but no parcels.
{18425}{18459}And the English?
{18526}{18590}I was on the stage before the war...
{18593}{18626}in vaudeville.
{18665}{18746}- Ever see me?|- Theater's too deep for me.
{18749}{18787}I prefer bicycling.
{18792}{18833}You follow the Tour de France?
{18852}{18962}You must've heard of Fabert,|Garrigoud, Petit Breton...
{19080}{19125}Can we purchase what we like?
{19130}{19178}Yes, through the canteen.
{19180}{19269}Fine, I'll buy myself|a comfortable armchair...
{19279}{19343}playing cards, a few books,|English cigarettes.
{19348}{19384}You won't fiind those.
{19492}{19552}There you go, sir.|I'll come again tomorrow.
{19554}{19614}Gentlemen, time to eat.
{19720}{19753}Sir...
{19876}{19938}So, gentlemen,|what shall we begin with?
{19943}{19986}Chicken, foie gras,
{19991}{20041}or Captain Cook mackerel?
{20048}{20084}You're well provisioned.
{20089}{20139}Don't they feed us here?
{20151}{20245}In theory, they do,|but what they give us is inedible.
{20269}{20360}Fortunately, we have our parcels,|especially our friend Rosenthal's.
{20362}{20393}Oh, please!
{20398}{20465}A cognac to start with, sir?
{20497}{20545}I've never eaten so well in my life.
{20549}{20583}Some fish?
{20592}{20669}I'm getting used to|Rosenthal's kindness.
{20674}{20741}Man is such an adaptable creature.
{20746}{20813}You can see he's a professor...
{20818}{20868}Profess her... Confess her...
{20873}{20952}Address her... undress her...
{20959}{20990}Oops, a slip!
{20995}{21041}You're quite a joker!
{21046}{21106}Is that supposed to be witty?
{21125}{21158}He's hard to please!
{21180}{21233}Let's drink to peace!
{21237}{21261}Not bad, this cognac.
{21266}{21333}Comes from Fouquet's|in mouthwash bottles.
{21338}{21372}Fouquet's?
{21377}{21448}It's a bar on the Champs-Elysées.
{21451}{21568}When I went to Paris, I ate|at my brother-in-law's. It's cheaper.
{21576}{21643}- Been to Paris lately?|- Last week.
{21647}{21703}Lucky man! Places crowded?
{21705}{21765}Maxim's was packed.
{21772}{21827}I never go to places like that...
{21844}{21926}I prefer a nice little bar...|with good wine.
{21945}{22033}- Maxim's... don't know it either.|- It's no great loss.
{22036}{22105}We know you eat|at your brother-in-law's...
{22225}{22273}He never lets up!
{22345}{22400}Is he there, "Mr. Monocle"?
{22405}{22427}No, he's not.
{22429}{22532}I've just been to the canteen.|It's about his armchair request...
{22549}{22585}Let him tighten his belt!
{22590}{22618}I'll tell him.
{22710}{22791}He's nice, the guy with the parcels.|Well off?
{22801}{22873}And how!|You know the Rosenthal bank?
{22901}{22940}His parents.
{23000}{23036}Am I tickling you?
{23048}{23112}- And what's he do?|- Runs a big fashion house.
{23115}{23201}Funny.|With his money, I wouldn't...
{23211}{23256}What do you do in civilian life?
{23280}{23326}I'm a engineer for the cadaster.
{23333}{23362}Sure, the cadaster...
{23393}{23501}just between us...|can we trust your pal, the Captain?
{23508}{23566}He may seem strange,|but he's okay.
{23570}{23616}You can trust him all right.
{23637}{23685}- It's all right, then.|- Why?
{23695}{23767}You see, after dark...|we're digging a tunnel.
{23772}{23796}What for?
{23800}{23834}To escape.
{23839}{23880}What do you dig with?
{23884}{23944}A coal shovel, old food cans...
{23956}{24031}I calculate|we should come up in a garden
{24033}{24110}behind those buildings there.|It's open country.
{24122}{24153}That's slow work.
{24158}{24251}We've been at it for two months.|just a few more weeks...
{24256}{24304}The war'll be over fiirst.
{24306}{24354}You're deluding yourself.
{24374}{24405}Think so?
{24414}{24462}Best to be prepared.
{24467}{24496}Where's the tunnel?
{24501}{24561}You'll see tonight, after roll call.
{24565}{24616}So you're digging a hole...
{24642}{24716}Like Monte Cristo. What a laugh!
{24728}{24817}- Thanks for the wash.|- You can't do it with your arm.
{24824}{24877}Mind if I ask you something?
{24882}{24908}Go ahead.
{24911}{24963}What's a "cadaster"?
{25030}{25069}- Maréchal.|- Present.
{25071}{25146}- Boeldieu.|- Captain de Boeldieu.
{25186}{25263}- Cartier.|- Here...we go again!
{25285}{25318}Good night, Arthur!
{26320}{26368}- Whose turn is it?|- Cartier's.
{26438}{26464}What's that for?
{26469}{26563}For breathing.|These are to extend the line.
{26567}{26598}And the bags?
{26601}{26644}For removing earth.
{26668}{26730}This is the alarm.
{26793}{26889}If I start to suffocate,|I yank on the string...
{26901}{26949}The can falls...
{26951}{27040}And the boys pull me out by the feet...
{27049}{27080}The feet...
{27193}{27229}What are you waiting for?
{27253}{27313}Watch me play the mole...
{27337}{27368}mol-asses!
{27522}{27565}Is the tunnel safe?
{27570}{27651}It's shored up with wood|from the theater.
{27656}{27692}And the earth?
{27697}{27742}Stuffed under the floorboards.
{27747}{27814}But there's not an inch of space left.
{27819}{27898}Now we fiill bags and empty them|during exercise.
{28265}{28301}Hear that?
{28320}{28368}I'm sure I heard something.
{28452}{28485}It's nothing.
{28509}{28538}Listen...
{28620}{28687}We'll send someone out|to check.
{28713}{28797}You've got an innocent face.|Go take a peek outside.
{28804}{28857}I'll pretend to go to the latrine.
{29735}{29794}Say, Arthur, what happened?
{29799}{29857}The fellow tried to escape.
{29862}{29946}We caught him in the garden|behind those buildings...
{29953}{29986}We opened fire.
{29993}{30034}Behind the buildings?
{30037}{30094}- Is he dead?|- I think so.
{30104}{30161}And you, what are you doing out?
{30240}{30274}Going to the latrine.
{31331}{31415}- What was it?|- Someone tried to escape.
{31420}{31499}He got as far as the garden|behind the buildings.
{31511}{31562}A sentry shot him.
{31576}{31609}He's dead.
{31621}{31665}The alarm!
{31856}{31914}- No answer.|- Pull him out.
{33309}{33338}Hurt bad?
{33501}{33542}Drink some cognac.
{33631}{33664}From Fouquet's.
{33822}{33914}Here's mud in your eye.|Don't drop the bottle.
{34000}{34041}Who goes down tomorrow?
{34048}{34113}You do, sir... if you don't mind.
{34129}{34240}My pleasure. I understand|crawling is fine exercise.
{34314}{34386}I remind you it is strictly forbidden
{34391}{34479}to receive non-military clothing.
{35019}{35045}Good news?
{35069}{35179}It's from my aunt in Bordeaux.|People are swarming into town.
{35194}{35223}What do you think?
{35227}{35266}They'd better watch out,
{35271}{35333}the Germans are claiming|a major breakthrough.
{35335}{35424}There's been no bell-ringing|so it can't mean much.
{35429}{35462}Up for some gardening?
{35601}{35673}I hate the way|German bulletins exaggerate.
{35678}{35714}And our papers don't?
{35719}{35788}Remember the "Russian steamroller"?
{35805}{35901}Isn't it time we got down|to serious business?
{35908}{35952}Sure, but not all at once.
{36968}{37014}And that famous General "Winter,"
{37018}{37083}so lethal to the nasty Krauts
{37088}{37143}but so tonic to the Allies...
{37146}{37232}And do you remember "Turpinite"?
{37237}{37364}A flask the size of... a radish|that could blow up a whole battalion.
{37368}{37469}They even tried it on a flock of sheep.
{37472}{37527}Too bad they didn't stop at that.
{37764}{37834}- What're you guys planting?|- Dandelions.
{37836}{37894}I'm dreaming of dandelion salad.
{37896}{37975}The war'll be over|before your dandelions grow.
{38006}{38107}This singular exercise|will give us workman's hands.
{38112}{38148}The trunks are here!
{38150}{38184}- The costumes?|- At the theater.
{38188}{38270}There should be a trunk|with women's clothes.
{38289}{38313}Coming, sir?
{38318}{38409}My theatrical skills are questionable.|Besides, I'm engaged.
{38411}{38486}- Playing patience?|- Exactly. I'm a realist.
{39577}{39627}Find anything, Arthur?
{39637}{39677}Nothing.
{39685}{39757}Well, gentlemen, enjoy yourselves.
{39953}{39989}Where will we put all this?
{39994}{40044}I asked for hangers.
{40102}{40150}Be careful...
{40159}{40229}These things|should be handled with care...
{40234}{40270}with your eyes closed.
{40301}{40356}Looks like a little girl's dress.
{40361}{40413}Dresses are short now.
{40459}{40497}just below the knee.
{40507}{40560}So I hear. I'd love to see that!
{40564}{40596}Then put it on.
{40600}{40658}Not him, he never shaves.
{40660}{40754}- You have an angel face, Maisonneuve.|- Anything to amuse.
{40790}{40855}We have to take inventory.
{40922}{40965}The corset, too!
{40970}{40998}Take it easy.
{41003}{41078}It's not only the dresses.|They wear their hair short, too.
{41082}{41114}Short hair!
{41126}{41176}It's like sleeping with a boy!
{41181}{41250}When we're not around,|women act foolish.
{41255}{41317}I'm sure my wife hasn't cut her hair.
{41322}{41380}That's for high-class floozies.
{41387}{41432}How would you know,|with that mug?
{41437}{41500}- Shoes!|- How small they are!
{41504}{41533}Stockings.
{41571}{41622}Stockings of sheerest silk!
{41627}{41682}Hey, fellas, I'm ready!
{41689}{41744}Let us dream a bit first.
{41749}{41809}You'll only stifle our imagination.
{41818}{41859}Look at that!
{41864}{41895}Black stockings!
{42029}{42065}Looks like a real girl!
{42070}{42104}Funny, huh?
{42125}{42157}Doesn't it look funny?
{42545}{42588}Yeah, sure looks funny.
{42945}{42986}Poor boys.
{43679}{43727}Enjoy yourselves.
{43991}{44048}Out there, children play soldier...
{44087}{44151}In here, soldiers play like children.
{44168}{44235}I wish I knew what's going on|back home.
{44283}{44322}- No news?|- Nothing.
{44326}{44381}I don't care what my missus is up to.
{44386}{44523}I want out|'cause I'm bored stiff... bored!
{44595}{44662}So you want to escape for the fun ofit.
{44664}{44684}Right!
{44688}{44748}For me, it's the spirit|of contradiction.
{44751}{44827}They won't let me fiight,|so I'm dying to.
{44832}{44926}I hate being here|when others are biting the dust.
{44931}{44964}For me it's simple.
{44969}{45058}A golf course is for golf.|A tennis court for tennis.
{45062}{45125}A prison camp is for escaping.
{45130}{45177}And you, Rosenthal, the sportsman...
{45182}{45245}Him? He was born in Jerusalem.
{45247}{45374}No, in Vienna. To a Danish mother|and a Polish father, naturalized French.
{45381}{45429}Old Celtic aristocracy!
{45444}{45561}Yet for all your French roots, none|of you owns an acre ofyour country.
{45566}{45640}In 35 years,|the Rosenthals have acquired
{45645}{45710}three chateaux with hunting preserves,
{45715}{45779}farms, orchards, warrens, stud farms,
{45784}{45846}and 3 galleries of bona fiide ancestors.
{45851}{45926}If that's not worth escaping|to fight for!
{45928}{46043}I'd never considered patriotism|from such an unusual angle.
{46048}{46098}With all those game preserves,
{46103}{46172}your lackeys must|really stuff themselves.
{46177}{46237}I got into the war in a funny way.
{46244}{46333}I became a soldier|because I'm a vegetarian.
{46376}{46463}That's right.|My brother and I had stomach ailments.
{46467}{46547}The doctor warned us|against eating meat.
{46556}{46618}I turned vegetarian and got well.
{46626}{46686}My brother went on eating meat,
{46690}{46772}got sick and was invalided out.
{46777}{46873}Your citations show vegetarianism|didn't interfere with duty.
{46880}{46942}Or stop my wife from cheating on me.
{47045}{47096}You have to admit it's stirring.
{47443}{47484}I loathe fifes.
{47506}{47551}Still, it gets to you.
{47575}{47637}It's not the music that gets to you...
{47678}{47719}It's the marching feet.
{47951}{48057}Thanks to your dumb talk|I ruined my pants...
{48455}{48589}FORT DOUAUMONT TAKEN!
{49309}{49404}What about our show?|Do we still put it on?
{49409}{49472}You bet we do!|All the more reason.
{49479}{49553}In fact we should invite|the German Officers.
{49558}{49673}Although I won't join|in your artistic endeavors, Maréchal,
{49687}{49762}let me congratulateyou...|That's the spirit!
{50397}{50495}Have you met Marguerite|She's neither tall nor petite
{50500}{50594}With eyes that glow, skin like snow|And lips in a cupid's bow
{50601}{50699}Well, when this divine creation|Heard my ardent declaration
{50704}{50793}She gave me a rose, tweaked my nose|Saying, "I'll give you joy"
{50800}{50896}I said, "Thanks all the same|But that's not why I came"
{50901}{50989}If you want to give me joy
{50994}{51073}Marguerite, Marguerite
{51088}{51162}If you want to give me joy
{51176}{51263}Make me your loverboy
{51277}{51332}'Neath her window I waited
{51337}{51380}And then I serenaded::
{51385}{51490}"My soul's apyre|since your eyes set my heart on fire!"
{51495}{51589}So this sweet and caring dame|To put out my raging flame
{51598}{51704}Did a bucket spill from her sill|Asking, "Is it burning still?"
{51709}{51819}I said, "Thanks all the same|But that's not why I came"
{52030}{52092}If you want to give me joy
{52097}{52181}Marguerite, let me be your loverboy
{52188}{52224}All together now!
{53102}{53183}And now... direct from Paris!
{55204}{55250}Get it, Arthur?
{55523}{55581}Stop the show! Stop the show!
{55626}{55655}Stop, fellas!
{55667}{55748}We've retaken Douaumont!|It's in the German papers.
{57916}{57969}A little hole, to escape.
{58985}{59100}GERMAN TROOPS|RECAPTURE DOUAUMONT
{59179}{59232}Isn't that awful?
{59237}{59280}Can't be much left of it!
{60170}{60273}Get off my back!|I can't take it any more! I'm fed up!
{60278}{60342}I want to see some light!
{60345}{60433}It stinks of shit in here!|Hear me? It stinks of shit!
{60438}{60489}And I want to hear a voice.
{60635}{60716}I want to hear a French voice.
{62507}{62553}What was he yelling about?
{62620}{62668}The war's too long.
{62927}{62968}If my calculations are right,
{62972}{63064}we should be under the garden wall|in four days.
{63112}{63167}That's a lot of dirt!
{63176}{63224}Now that we may get away
{63227}{63320}and reach home again,|I'm afraid of what's waiting for me.
{63323}{63385}There's more than one woman on earth!
{63390}{63418}Not for me.
{63421}{63471}That's why she cheats on you.
{63481}{63572}One thing upsets me:|leaving Maréchal behind.
{63577}{63632}It weighs on me as well.
{63634}{63699}In fact... it disturbs me.
{63756}{63824}But that's war. No room for sentiment.
{64107}{64147}Glad to seeyou, old man.
{64152}{64210}We are, too.|Wait until you hear why.
{64212}{64248}You old dog!
{64272}{64337}Got anything to eat? I'm hungry.
{64392}{64493}Have a seat.|Rosenthal's getting some grub ready.
{64677}{64708}What time is it?
{64730}{64761}11 o'clock.
{64792}{64840}Time's dragging today.
{64845}{64924}Sure, but tonight it's aufwiedersehen!
{64938}{64984}So, we meet in Amsterdam?
{64989}{65068}I'm keen to see Holland,|for the tulips.
{65073}{65185}What about the cheese?|Don'tyou like Dutch cheese?
{65188}{65296}Sure, but they say the tulip fiields|stretch for miles.
{65301}{65363}You have the instincts of a shop girl.
{65497}{65545}Assembly at three o'clock.
{65550}{65600}All Officers are to change camps.
{65605}{65646}Get your things ready.
{66133}{66219}Gentlemen,|I wish you a pleasant journey.
{66228}{66317}I hope you will see|your wives again soon.
{66859}{66905}We ought to alert them.
{66948}{67000}About the tunnel.
{67406}{67466}Sir, there's a tunnel in Barrack 7.
{71134}{71191}Open the window.|It stinks in here!
{71436}{71541}Sir, may I point out there are|only two pairs of white gloves left.
{71577}{71635}We can't get any gloves here.
{71649}{71702}Try to make them last.
{71707}{71781}Yes, sir... More coffee, sir?
{71832}{71918}If you call this muck coffee,|I have to accept it.
{71949}{72016}At least it warms my insides.
{72088}{72141}The list of new prisoners, sir.
{73193}{73258}Three new officer POWs reporting, sir!
{73457}{73510}Delighted to see you again, Boeldieu.
{73620}{73683}But I'm sorry to see you here.
{73697}{73726}We feel the same.
{73798}{73829}Sit down, gentlemen.
{73831}{73872}No, thank you, sir.
{73889}{73915}As you wish.
{74169}{74217}Captain de Boeldieu,
{74246}{74301}four escape attempts:
{74323}{74411}Through a heating duct,|in a garbage bin,
{74423}{74505}via the sewers,|in a laundry basket.
{74512}{74562}One must lower oneself,|at times.
{74582}{74620}I understand.
{74632}{74728}Lieutenant Maréchal,|five attempts at escape:
{74742}{74793}Disguised as a chimney sweep...
{74797}{74860}Correction, sir:|heating engineer.
{74865}{74917}Disguised as a German soldier,
{74922}{74970}disguised as a woman.
{74987}{75037}Amusing, very amusing.
{75044}{75176}But less so when an NCO|tried to pick me up. That I didn't like!
{75191}{75217}Indeed?
{75224}{75263}I assure you.
{75303}{75375}Lieutenant Demolder,|three attempts...
{75500}{75581}Gentlemen, I respect|your patriotism and courage.
{75625}{75742}But the situation|is completely different here.
{75776}{75843}No one escapes from this fortress.
{75869}{75915}You understand me, don't you?
{75963}{76078}So as not to be accused|of German barbarism,
{76099}{76181}I have decided to apply|French regulations.
{76337}{76370}Look them over.
{76380}{76464}They make good bedtime reading.
{76579}{76684}And now, gentlemen,|if you will follow me...
{76718}{76766}Oswald! My coat.
{77200}{77248}My soldiers aren't young,
{77253}{77336}but they enjoy playing soldier.
{77818}{77883}We have 25 more guns like this one.
{77941}{78025}I suppose you know the Maxim gun?
{78029}{78063}Very well, sir.
{78109}{78149}But I prefer the restaurant.
{78154}{78188}Touché!
{78624}{78653}12th century.
{78988}{79036}Excuse me, sir...
{79044}{79147}Was this villa built specially|for Captain de Boeldieu and myself?
{79192}{79240}Are we your only boarders?
{79322}{79408}Your comrades are back there.
{79525}{79554}1 3th century.
{79983}{80043}A 1 20-foot drop.
{80075}{80199}So kind of you|to show us around the grounds.
{80202}{80250}It's such a nice castle, sir.
{80295}{80329}It's so old...
{80401}{80434}And so cheerful.
{80686}{80782}Sorry I can't give you|a room to yourself.
{80784}{80859}I'm touched,|but I'd never have accepted.
{80950}{81024}I hope our walk|didn't weary you too much.
{81026}{81079}Not at all, sir, we're fiine.
{81379}{81441}- 14th century.|- Pure Gothic.
{81496}{81554}Ifyou don't mind, gentlemen...
{81573}{81700}Your friend Lt. Rosenthal,|from the Hallbach camp, is here.
{81724}{81810}- Not old Rosenthal!|- He wasn't any luckier.
{81846}{81925}The commandant has put you all|in the same room.
{81928}{81997}That way you'll eat better.
{82009}{82057}That's very nice of him.
{82117}{82156}A mere formality.
{82487}{82546}- I caught it with a brunette.|- Who can you trust?
{82549}{82650}A friend of my mother's.|Quite respectable. She did charity work.
{82657}{82726}In good society it's usually the pox.
{82731}{82755}Right, Boeldieu?
{82760}{82861}The pox used to be our privilege.|But we've lost it.
{82865}{82901}Like so many others.
{82913}{82949}Everything is popularized.
{82954}{83052}Cancer and gout|aren't working-class diseases,
{83057}{83110}but they will be, believe me.
{83117}{83158}How about intellectuals?
{83160}{83208}With us it's tuberculosis.
{83213}{83254}Here's Mr. Pindar.
{83259}{83295}And the middle class?
{83297}{83371}Liver and intestinal ailments...|They eat too much.
{83374}{83441}We'd each die|ofour own class diseases,
{83446}{83517}if war didn't make all germs equal.
{83529}{83580}Your dictionaries are in myway.
{83585}{83616}Excuse me,
{83621}{83702}but Pindar has always been|so badly translated.
{83707}{83769}A lamentable oversight.|I'm so sorry.
{83786}{83880}Not that I care,|but who's this guy Pindar?
{83882}{83968}Go on,joke! But Pindar|means more to me than anything...
{83973}{84026}More than you, the war, my life!
{84062}{84119}Pindar is the greatest Greek poet.
{84143}{84182}The greatest Greek poet?
{84196}{84237}You don't say...
{84290}{84352}There! My map'sjust about finished.
{84388}{84448}See... this is where we are...
{84505}{84565}16 miles above this bend|in the Main River.
{84570}{84649}To reach Switzerland|above Lake Constance
{84654}{84735}and avoid the Rhine,|we'd have to travel...
{84750}{84807}- 200 miles.|- No kidding!
{84812}{84937}That means walking 15 nights on 6 lumps|of sugar and 2 biscuits a day.
{84968}{85083}You and your map, you're as crazy|as him and his Pindar. To escape...
{85086}{85145}There! My picture's finished.
{85177}{85227}"Justice Pursuing Crime."
{85234}{85277}It came out all right.
{85332}{85404}Look, to reach this Constance place...
{85553}{85591}Will it hold?
{85603}{85678}It can hold 10 of you and 5 like me.
{85726}{85771}They're searching the rooms!
{85860}{85929}- Under the mattress, quick!|- No, under mine!
{85934}{85975}That won't do.
{85989}{86023}It's childish.
{86040}{86071}May I?
{86315}{86354}Now there's an idea!
{86359}{86411}A convenient little gutter.
{86469}{86498}Here they are!
{86598}{86658}Gentlemen... inspection.
{86917}{86963}"Louise wrote to Victor:
{86965}{87073}I am as weary as a girl|after 22 nights oflove."
{87104}{87162}22 nights oflove, imagine that!
{87948}{87975}Continue!
{88142}{88181}Not that corner!
{88353}{88471}Give me your word that you've nothing|in here against regulations.
{88505}{88545}You have my word.
{88562}{88632}But why my word and not theirs?
{88677}{88725}The word of a...
{88756}{88795}Rosenthal...
{88814}{88869}and a Maréchal?
{88879}{88926}It's as good as ours.
{88977}{89001}Perhaps.
{89178}{89255}No, not that!
{89260}{89305}It's very rare.
{89605}{89660}Poor old Pindar!
{89699}{89749}They really are stupid.
{90135}{90190}Everything go all right in here?
{90219}{90274}- Not bad.|- For us, too.
{90729}{90797}And how is your cousin,|Edmond de Boeldieu,
{90801}{90876}the military attaché I met in Berlin?
{90881}{90926}He's doing well. He's very happy.
{90931}{90996}He lost an arm|and married a rich woman.
{91005}{91065}A truly fine career.
{91281}{91310}Recognize her?
{91523}{91552}Sit down.
{91569}{91612}Let me tell you something...
{91641}{91679}Believe me,
{91696}{91751}my present functions
{91765}{91813}revolt me as much as they do you.
{91842}{91868}That's being harsh.
{91876}{91926}I used to be a combatant.
{91933}{92041}Now I'm a bureaucrat, a policeman.
{92077}{92125}But it's the only way
{92134}{92202}I can still appear to be
{92209}{92283}serving my fatherland.
{92321}{92401}I have burns all over...|That explains my gloves.
{92437}{92513}My spine is fractured in two places.
{92537}{92578}A silver plate.
{92597}{92657}In my kneecap, too.
{92715}{92827}I owe these riches|to the misfortunes ofwar.
{92839}{92899}- May I ask you a question?|- Of course.
{92945}{92986}Why did you make
{93007}{93043}an exception ofme
{93055}{93094}by inviting me here?
{93108}{93216}Because your name is Boeldieu,|career offiicer in the French Army.
{93230}{93338}And I am Rauffenstein, career offiicer|in the German Imperial Army.
{93357}{93408}But my comrades are Officers, as well.
{93415}{93508}A Maréchal and a Rosenthal, Officers?
{93515}{93554}They're fine soldiers.
{93559}{93626}Charming legacy|of the French Revolution.
{93659}{93755}Neither you nor I|can stop the march of time.
{93760}{93791}Boeldieu...
{93803}{93887}I don't know who will win this war,
{93899}{93954}but whatever the outcome,
{93959}{94055}it will mean the end of|the Rauffensteins and the Boeldieus.
{94060}{94101}We're no longer needed.
{94108}{94163}Isn't that a pity?
{94168}{94201}Perhaps.
{94300}{94371}I admire the way|you tend your geranium.
{94376}{94453}Don't think I've become a botanist,
{94475}{94551}but it's the only flower|in the fortress.
{94597}{94695}Nothing grows here but ivy and nettles.
{94719}{94774}I'm glad I'm leaving with you.
{94779}{94803}With us.
{94815}{94880}Sure, I like Boeldieu, but...
{94923}{94956}With him...
{95000}{95060}I never really feel at ease.
{95074}{95165}Different backgrounds...|There's a wall between us.
{95167}{95199}He's a terrifiic guy.
{95203}{95266}Sure, and he's on the level, but...
{95285}{95366}Suppose you and I were on the skids.
{95371}{95405}We'd just be two bums.
{95410}{95448}If it happened to him,
{95453}{95534}he'd still be " Monsieur de Boeldieu."
{95539}{95585}Anyway, you've been terrifiic, too,
{95589}{95654}feeding us with your parcels.
{95659}{95700}That's all vanity.
{95704}{95781}I'm really proud to come|from a rich family.
{95786}{95880}Inviting you to my table|is myway ofshowing it.
{95887}{95939}Most people think we're stingy.
{95944}{95999}Wrong. We're often generous.
{96004}{96069}Unfortunately, along with that quality,
{96071}{96138}Jehovah gave us an overdose of pride.
{96143}{96203}To hell with Jehovah!
{96208}{96268}All I know is you've been a real pal.
{96426}{96474}We've received a large crate,
{96479}{96534}a gift from our Czarina.
{96558}{96625}Please come and share it with us.
{96630}{96702}From the Czarina? Must be caviar.
{96707}{96791}- Coming, Boeldieu? They've got vodka.|- Vodka? Lead on.
{96915}{96999}Now we can pay you back|for all your kindness.
{97004}{97095}The Czarina is always good-hearted.
{97100}{97153}Quite a lady, your Czarina.
{97589}{97642}Think of what's in store!
{98037}{98131}"Principles ofAlgebra"...|"Elementary Ethics"... "Grammar"...
{98136}{98172}A cook book!
{98176}{98232}Something to sink your teeth into!
{98248}{98289}What a farce!
{98292}{98344}Let's go before something happens.
{98356}{98407}Goodbye, thanks anyway.
{98917}{99004}- The Cossacks aren't happy!|- Let's get out of here!
{99109}{99164}You have no right to burn books!
{99169}{99219}It's crazy sending us books!
{99589}{99653}The sentries are busy with the Russians.
{99656}{99723}It's a long drop here,|but it's unguarded.
{99728}{99802}If only we'd been ready!|What a chance!
{99807}{99876}- Especially at night!|- We'll try again.
{99900}{99977}It was kind ofthem|to hold a rehearsal for us.
{99991}{100092}Now we know if one man|can divert them for 5 minutes,
{100099}{100135}his comrades can escape.
{100140}{100202}- Too risky!|- You're exaggerating.
{100267}{100303}It would amuse me.
{100327}{100365}When do you want to go?
{100382}{100440}Why us? You're in it, too.
{100516}{100564}Why not? Don't you trust us?
{100596}{100663}- That wouldn't stop me.|- Well then?
{100672}{100742}A plan like yours|can only work with two men.
{100756}{100804}And I know your preference.
{100809}{100867}- It's not fair.|- What's fair in war?
{100871}{100919}We can't accept that.
{100922}{100967}I'm not asking you...
{100979}{101013}I'm telling you.
{101068}{101128}The arts aren't forbidden here.
{101130}{101161}You like music?
{101166}{101219}So-so... I like a good waltz.
{101224}{101260}I love the flute.
{101262}{101344}Here's the program:|We buy flutes for everyone.
{101358}{101437}On the given day:|concert in all the rooms at 5 p.m.
{101440}{101483}That's when night falls.
{101488}{101562}Five minutes later,|they confiiscate our flutes.
{101576}{101612}At 5:1 5,
{101627}{101694}another concert|with anything at hand:
{101708}{101754}saucepans, animal noises,
{101766}{101821}grinding teeth, whatever...
{101847}{101919}Result: assembly in the courtyard.
{101924}{101953}Then what?
{102010}{102085}That's my concern.|You'll have fiive minutes...
{102118}{102180}to clear the walls and reach the woods.
{102200}{102238}Look, Boeldieu,
{102252}{102336}I don't know how to put it,|but I feel awful about this.
{102341}{102396}- Come now!|- Yes, awful.
{102487}{102528}I'd like to say something...
{102535}{102607}Pour some warm water|over my gloves, will you?
{102679}{102756}Whatever happens,|I want you to know that...
{102761}{102833}I'm not doing this for you personally.
{102861}{102914}So we needn't get mawkish.
{102948}{102976}Go on.
{103012}{103058}But there are times in life...
{103060}{103113}Let's avoid them, shall we?
{103163}{103190}Excuse me...
{103422}{103475}So you'll be wearing those?
{103480}{103513}Any objections?
{103516}{103621}No, but white gloves|for this sort of thing, what an idea!
{103624}{103667}To each his own style.
{103756}{103825}You can't do anything|like other people.
{103849}{103909}We've been together|eighteen months,
{103919}{103964}and you still stand on ceremony.
{103967}{104053}I'm the same with my mother|and my wife.
{104110}{104142}In that case...
{104216}{104297}No thanks, English tobacco|gives me a sore throat.
{104324}{104391}No doubt about it: gloves, tobacco...
{104415}{104458}We've got nothing in common.
{104542}{104576}Say what you like,
{104600}{104676}but where there are Germans,|there is order.
{104715}{104777}Sure, the old man is a bit mad
{104782}{104842}with his flower pot and all...
{104847}{104947}A good thing I'm here|to keep those scoundrels in check.
{104962}{105012}I was a teacher back home.
{105482}{105583}Lieutenant, confiscate|those damned flutes at once!
{107297}{107345}I advise you not to start again!
{107371}{107424}We'll do just that in 15 minutes.
{107762}{107817}Order executed, sir.
{108043}{108119}You see? It worked.
{108129}{108232}Put them on bread and water|for three days. And no parcels.
{108258}{108309}Ready, boys... Two seconds...
{110104}{110136}Assembly!
{110234}{110291}I understand my students now.|What a lark!
{110296}{110337}While it lasts.
{110411}{110447}Well...
{110476}{110505}What?
{110560}{110584}Goodbye.
{111955}{111984}Boeldieu!
{112039}{112075}De Boeldieu!
{118604}{118626}Listen!
{118657}{118695}I beg you! Come down!
{120186}{120263}Lieutenants Maréchal and Rosenthal|have escaped.
{120491}{120527}So that's why.
{120637}{120678}Search lights!
{120697}{120752}Send out patrols with dogs!
{120767}{120848}Alert all military|and civil authorities!
{120867}{120927}Report back to me every quarter hour!
{122078}{122162}Your orders have been carried out, sir.
{122167}{122215}No sign of the fugitives yet.
{123224}{123275}Forgive me.
{123337}{123380}I would have done the same.
{123394}{123493}French or German, duty is duty.
{123557}{123596}Are you in pain?
{123651}{123732}I didn't think|a bullet in the stomach hurt so much.
{123747}{123797}I aimed at your legs.
{123850}{123922}It was 500 feet, with poor visibility...
{123970}{124027}Besides, I was running.
{124066}{124118}Please, no excuses.
{124135}{124176}I was clumsy.
{124243}{124325}I'm not the one to be pitied.
{124339}{124389}For me it will all be over...
{124409}{124442}soon.
{124495}{124548}But you'll have to carry on.
{124596}{124706}Carry on a futile existence.
{124778}{124864}For a commoner,|dying in a war is a tragedy.
{124900}{124977}But for you and me,
{125013}{125056}it's a good way out.
{125082}{125121}I missed my chance.
{125202}{125262}You shouldn't be talking so much.
{125838}{125866}Sir...
{128398}{128468}We should've avoided the road.
{128492}{128535}We couldn't sleep in the reeds.
{128580}{128612}He's gone.
{128652}{128705}Didn't you see it was a woman?
{128707}{128760}- Let's get going.|- Wait till dark.
{128763}{128818}I'm freezing, I have to move.
{129127}{129161}Want your sugar?
{129223}{129264}There's not much left.
{129269}{129307}And we've a long way to go.
{129312}{129415}- What about you?|- I ate mine, I was hungry.
{129436}{129496}You keep it, so I won't be tempted.
{129501}{129571}You poor thing...|You ate your buttons, too?
{129575}{129609}Does it show?
{129655}{129717}So we're not waiting till dark?
{129722}{129777}No, we'll skirt the village fiirst.
{129851}{129882}Your foot hurt?
{129887}{129925}It's nothing... a nerve.
{130470}{130496}Let's go.
{130666}{130700}You coming?
{131321}{131362}You coming or what?
{131510}{131546}I'm doing the best I can.
{131927}{131961}You and your foot!
{131963}{132011}It's not my fault! I slipped.
{132019}{132069}You slipped! That's all I hear.
{132074}{132153}If you get us caught,|you'll explain you slipped?
{132160}{132237}We're out offood.|Might as well give up now.
{132242}{132321}- Gladly. I've had enough too.|- Had enough ofme?
{132323}{132412}Damn right! If you only knew|how you make me sick!
{132417}{132488}Well, the feeling's mutual.
{132493}{132572}You're a dead weight,|a ball and chain.
{132577}{132625}I never could stomach Jews!
{132628}{132721}A bit late to realize that!|Clear out, you're dying too.
{132723}{132762}You said it!
{132767}{132824}Get lost! I'm sick ofyour ugly mug!
{132827}{132901}I'm going! You're on your own now!|So long!
{132906}{132946}So long! Go ahead!
{132949}{133009}I'm so happy I could sing...
{133014}{133107}There once was a little steamboat
{133112}{133160}Which had ne-ne-nevergone to sea
{133244}{133306}After five or six weeks at sea
{133378}{133450}The supplies|we real-al-almost gone for good...
{133889}{133927}Why'd you come back?
{134001}{134030}Come on.
{134217}{134256}Let's go, fella.
{134613}{134663}- Had enough?|- It's okay.
{134668}{134745}- Want to rest in that shed there?|- Too risky.
{134749}{134817}- I can't see any smoke.|- Even so...
{134821}{134893}When the ship's on fiire,|you go overboard.
{134896}{134946}Right. Overboard we go!
{134956}{134987}Let's go, old man.
{135212}{135284}- Someone's there.|- The window! Run for it.
{135289}{135337}I'll draw them off.
{135342}{135380}Don't move! Keep quiet.
{135442}{135483}Stay where you are!
{135955}{135984}French...
{136042}{136073}We're not thieves.
{136207}{136236}Prisoners of war?
{136296}{136332}You speak German?
{136404}{136488}I sprained my foot. We're exhausted.|We're not thieves.
{136519}{136545}I'm not afraid.
{136552}{136636}Go on, call the police.|I won't walk another step!
{136665}{136699}You sprained your foot?
{136888}{136938}She says to come into the house.
{136943}{136998}No, I don't trust her.
{137133}{137185}She says she's alone here.
{138288}{138377}She says her child's asleep,|so don't make any noise.
{138389}{138437}Come and sit down here.
{138559}{138595}I'll be right back.
{139384}{139430}Hungry? Yes.
{139437}{139511}- She asked if you're hungry.|- Yeah, I understood.
{139892}{139921}What about you?
{139938}{139983}I just want to sleep.
{141041}{141108}Excuse me, but how far is Wölfiisheim?
{141113}{141141}Eight miles.
{141187}{141257}I'd sooner stay here|than slog up there!
{141261}{141357}But duty's duty.|Thanks and good night.
{142096}{142158}Hush! My child's asleep!
{142242}{142271}My husband.
{142285}{142350}Killed at Verdun.
{142407}{142451}My brothers...
{142465}{142544}Killed at Liège...|Charleroi... Tannenberg.
{142614}{142659}Our biggest victories.
{142777}{142822}The table's too big now.
{143038}{143079}Relax, it's only me!
{143160}{143235}You don't mind|ifa Frenchman feeds you.
{143309}{143405}You smell like my grandfather's cows.|A good smell.
{143453}{143520}You're a cow from Würtemberg
{143525}{143609}and I'm a working man from Paris,|but we can still be pals!
{143656}{143719}You're a poor cow,|I'm a poor soldier.
{143731}{143776}We each do our best.
{145133}{145196}You're a bright little girl.
{145198}{145251}Mommy and I know everything.
{145256}{145292}Really?
{145296}{145390}Then how much milk|does the cow give each month?
{145395}{145469}Mommy knows that.|I know I have ten fiingers.
{145987}{146021}She asked for water.
{146028}{146064}I know.
{146085}{146193}For 18 months, I never understood|the guards. But her I understand.
{146574}{146649}- Nice, but it looks cheap.|- I did my best.
{146651}{146723}I was talking to Santa Claus.
{146819}{146872}Joseph's got a nice beard!
{146891}{146936}Here's the Virgin Mary.
{146953}{147001}Isn't my little donkey cute?
{147018}{147056}And my ox?
{147073}{147107}And the infant Jesus...
{147131}{147167}An ancestor of mine.
{147176}{147239}"Touché!"|as poor Boeldieu would say.
{147243}{147322}- Think he's dead?|- Let's not talk about it.
{147334}{147418}We're ready. Go get the kid.
{147493}{147574}Hold on...|The gramophone and the candles.
{147646}{147680}Lights out!
{147850}{147924}Lotte! Baby Jesus has come.
{147929}{147989}I knew he would!
{148269}{148317}Is it for me?
{148346}{148399}I want little Jesus.
{148404}{148447}To take to bed?
{148452}{148512}No, to eat.
{148538}{148588}He's not for eating.
{148593}{148648}She wants to eat Baby Jesus!
{148720}{148785}Strictly forbidden, my sweet!
{148819}{148866}Then I'll eat Joseph.
{148881}{148936}All right, but in bed.
{148986}{149056}She wants Joseph? There you go.
{149157}{149229}You're a good little girl.
{149336}{149392}Your gramophone's on the blink.
{149459}{149514}How do you say:|" Lotte has blue eyes"?
{150034}{150072}Go to sleep, pumpkin.
{150612}{150667}I don't know how to thank you.
{150672}{150713}Thank us?
{150720}{150770}We owe you so much.
{150821}{150866}Well... good night.
{153453}{153496}I'll make some coffee.
{153499}{153532}The coffee's ready.
{153554}{153580}Say it in French.
{153849}{153897}Have you told her we're leaving?
{153957}{153983}Not yet.
{153988}{154019}It's high time.
{154086}{154120}You tell her.
{154307}{154376}- We must be going.|- I knew it.
{154379}{154491}Maréchal couldn't bear to tell you.
{154510}{154542}Why?
{154558}{154614}I always knew he'd have to go.
{154827}{154858}Come on in.
{154884}{154923}There's hot coffee.
{155426}{155493}You should eat something|before you go.
{155692}{155736}Do we wait until dark?
{155740}{155772}Sure.
{156059}{156138}Let's say good-bye to the cow.
{156213}{156270}I've been alone too long.
{156311}{156357}I've waited so long.
{156419}{156481}If you knew how happy I've been
{156529}{156620}to hear your footsteps|around the house.
{156807}{156853}Elsa... Listen.
{156939}{156990}When war over...
{157016}{157071}if me not dead...
{157076}{157117}Understand?
{157141}{157232}I... come back here... no?
{157296}{157342}And you... after... come...
{157354}{157424}with me... to France.
{157431}{157467}With Lotte... no?
{157565}{157623}For the journey.
{157826}{157879}Go quickly. It's better that way.
{158867}{158960}- Not looking back?|- If I do, I might never leave.
{159809}{159876}- Let's move.|- We're not waiting till dark?
{159879}{159922}We'd lose ourway.
{159929}{160037}The woods will hide us. But in|the valley, we'll have to stay low.
{160042}{160094}You're sure that's Switzerland?
{160097}{160159}- Positive.|- It all looks the same.
{160162}{160250}You can't see borders.|They're man-made.
{160262}{160305}Nature couldn't care less.
{160320}{160375}I want to see an end to all this.
{160387}{160423}Then I'd go back for Elsa.
{160428}{160471}- You love her?|- I think so.
{160476}{160526}Even if we do make it,
{160531}{160639}you'll go back to flying|and me to gunning, we'll keep fighting.
{160643}{160725}Like the fellas.|We've got to end this damn war...
{160730}{160771}and make it the last.
{160775}{160811}Don't delude yourself.
{160816}{160902}Let's come down to earth.|What if we run into a patrol?
{160905}{160974}We split up, and try our luck.
{160977}{161065}just in case, let's say goodbye|and see you soon.
{161085}{161166}- So long, you dirty Jew.|- So long, you old dog.
{162130}{162188}Don't shoot!|They're in Switzerland.
{162190}{162231}Good for them!
