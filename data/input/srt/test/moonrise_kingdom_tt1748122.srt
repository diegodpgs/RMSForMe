1
00:01:30,376 --> 00:01:31,625
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">In order to show you how</font>

2
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:34,209
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">a big symphony
orchestra is put together,</font>

3
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:37,378
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Benjamin Britten
has written a big piece of music,</font>

4
00:01:37,461 --> 00:01:39,210
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">which is made up
of smaller pieces</font>

5
00:01:39,293 --> 00:01:42,292
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">that show you all
the separate parts of the orchestra.</font>

6
00:01:42,376 --> 00:01:45,167
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">These smaller pieces
are called variations,</font>

7
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:48,752
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">which means different ways
of playing the same tune.</font>

8
00:01:48,877 --> 00:01:52,085
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">First of all,
he lets us hear the tune or the theme,</font>

9
00:01:52,168 --> 00:01:53,292
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">which is a beautiful melody</font>

10
00:01:53,376 --> 00:01:56,753
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">by the much older
British composer Henry Purcell.</font>

11
00:01:56,836 --> 00:02:01,294
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Here is Purcell's theme
played by the whole orchestra together.</font>

12
00:02:30,545 --> 00:02:34,505
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Now, Mr. Britten lets you hear
the four different families of the orchestra</font>

13
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:37,545
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">playing the same Purcell theme
in different ways.</font>

14
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:39,420
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">First, we hear
the woodwind family.</font>

15
00:02:39,504 --> 00:02:43,170
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">The flutes, the oboes,
the clarinets and the bassoons.</font>

16
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:07,381
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Here comes the brass family.</font>

17
00:03:07,464 --> 00:03:10,755
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">The trumpets, the horns,
the trombones and the tubas.</font>

18
00:03:16,882 --> 00:03:18,257
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">One to four.</font>

19
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:33,674
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Now, Mr. Britten arranges the Purcell theme
for the string family.</font>

20
00:03:33,758 --> 00:03:34,798
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I'm sick of this rain.</font>

21
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:39,299
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">The violins,
the violas, the cellos and the double basses.</font>

22
00:03:39,383 --> 00:03:41,759
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">And of course, the harp.</font>

23
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:05,134
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">And finally
the percussion family,</font>

24
00:04:05,217 --> 00:04:08,509
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">all those drums and gongs
and things you hit.</font>

25
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,677
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">After this, you will
hear the theme by Purcell</font>

26
00:04:14,761 --> 00:04:18,676
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">played once more in its original
form by all four families together.</font>

27
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,051
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">That is, the whole orchestra.</font>

28
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:47,053
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">This is
the island of New Penzance.</font>

29
00:04:48,428 --> 00:04:50,304
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">16 miles long.</font>

30
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,471
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Forested with
old-growth pine and maple.</font>

31
00:04:55,637 --> 00:04:58,219
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Criss-crossed by
shallow tidal creeks.</font>

32
00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:01,720
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Chickchaw territory.</font>

33
00:05:02,262 --> 00:05:03,303
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">There are no
paved roads, but...</font>

34
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,595
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Here comes Jed
with the mail.</font>

35
00:05:06,678 --> 00:05:10,721
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">But instead many miles of intersecting
footpaths and dirt trails,</font>

36
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:13,846
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">and a ferry that
runs twice daily from Stone Cove.</font>

37
00:05:14,803 --> 00:05:18,180
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">The year is 1965.</font>

38
00:05:19,222 --> 00:05:22,222
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">We are on the far edge
of Black Beacon Sound,</font>

39
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:24,971
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">famous for the ferocious
and well-documented storm,</font>

40
00:05:25,054 --> 00:05:28,304
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">which will
strike from the east on the 5th of September.</font>

41
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:31,556

00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:48,973
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Morning, Gadge.</font>

43
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:50,348
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Morning, sir.</font>

latrine inspection.</font>

45
00:06:10,056 --> 00:06:11,391
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Good.</font>

46
00:06:13,517 --> 00:06:15,726
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Roosevelt,
how's that lanyard coming?</font>

47
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:17,891
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Horrible.</font>

48
00:06:21,974 --> 00:06:23,724
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Skotak,
what's all this lumber for?</font>

49
00:06:23,807 --> 00:06:25,142
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">We're building a tree house.</font>

50
00:06:25,225 --> 00:06:26,557
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">- Where?
- Right here.</font>

51
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:32,518
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">That's not a safe altitude.
Why is it up so high?</font>

52
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,683
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">If someone falls from there,
that's a guaranteed death.</font>

53
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:35,893
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Well, where would
you have built it?</font>

54
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:38,144
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Lower.</font>

<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Nickleby?
What are you doing?</font>

56
00:06:45,893 --> 00:06:47,518
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Pest control.
Burning some ants.</font>

57

a uniform violation.</font>

you up to, Panagle?</font>

62

<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Sixteen and a half, sir.</font>

63
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,810

for the Hullabaloo?</font>

Captain Sharp, over.</font>

<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Captain Sharp, this is Randall
Ward over at Camp Ivanhoe. Over.</font>

84
00:09:03,316 --> 00:09:05,358
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Morning, Randy.
What can I do for you? Over.</font>

85
00:09:05,441 --> 00:09:10,026
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I'm not sure exactly.
I've got an escaped Khaki Scout. Over.</font>

86
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:13,151
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">What does that mean? Over.</font>

87
00:09:13,234 --> 00:09:14,860
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">One of my boys
seems to have stolen</font>

88
00:09:14,943 --> 00:09:16,859
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">a miniature canoe and
some fishing tackle,</font>

two bedrolls, plus an air rifle.</font>

90
00:09:19,984 --> 00:09:22,027
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">And disappeared. Over.</font>

91
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,486
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Any idea why? Over.</font>

92
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:26,735
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">No. He left me
a letter of resignation. Over.</font>

93
00:09:26,818 --> 00:09:28,027
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Dear Scout Master Ward,</font>

94
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,818
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I am very sad to inform you
I can no longer be involved</font>

<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">The rest of the troop
will probably be glad to hear this.</font>

<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">It is not your fault.</font>

00:09:39,611 --> 00:09:42,986

notify his folks. Over.</font>

100
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:45,320
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Okay. Over and out.</font>

104
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:08,529
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Hello?</font>

105
00:10:08,612 --> 00:10:10,362
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Hello, sir.
This is Captain Sharp.</font>

106
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:13,779
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Yes, sir. I received your
message. Thank you very much.</font>

107
00:10:13,862 --> 00:10:17,321
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">In fact, we've come to
a decision, as a family,</font>

108
00:10:17,405 --> 00:10:21,571
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">because this is only the most recent
incident involving Sam's troubles,</font>

109
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:24,780
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">and it's just not
fair to the others, so, unfortunately,</font>

110
00:10:24,863 --> 00:10:28,238
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">we can't invite him
back at this time.</font>

111
00:10:30,655 --> 00:10:34,405
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">There's no cause
for alarm, sir. We'll find him.</font>

112
00:10:34,487 --> 00:10:37,196
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">We're simply notifying you
as a matter of protocol and so on.</font>

113
00:10:37,532 --> 00:10:40,573
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I understand that.
I'm notifying you of the situation on my end.</font>

114
00:10:41,614 --> 00:10:44,614
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I'm confused by
that statement. You can't invite him back?</font>

115
00:10:45,197 --> 00:10:48,574
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I'm afraid not.
He's a good boy. He's got a good heart.</font>

116
00:10:48,658 --> 00:10:51,366
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">But it's just not fair
to the others, you see?</font>

117
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,323
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">He's emotionally disturbed.</font>

118
00:10:57,989 --> 00:10:59,699
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Am I speaking
with Sam's father?</font>

119
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:03,448
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">No, sir.</font>

120
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:05,740
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Sam's parents passed away
a number of years ago.</font>

us since last June.</font>

This is Scout Master Ward speaking.</font>

124
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,824
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Are you implying
that Sam is an orphan?</font>

125
00:11:17,408 --> 00:11:19,492
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Well, it's a known fact.
Of course he is.</font>

126
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:21,701
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Well, why the hell
doesn't it say so in the register?</font>

127
00:11:21,785 --> 00:11:22,867
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Excuse my language.</font>

128
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,199
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I don't know.
What register?</font>

129
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:29,909
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">We sent him a letter.
It should reach you presently.</font>

130
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:34,075
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Mr. Billingsley,
I've got an escaped Khaki Scout.</font>

131
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,450
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">We are notifying you
as a matter of protocol.</font>

132
00:11:36,534 --> 00:11:39,742
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">You say you can't
invite him back? You say that he's an orphan?</font>

133
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,075
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I don't understand
how that works.</font>

134
00:11:42,825 --> 00:11:44,701
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">What am I supposed
to do with him?</font>

135
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,409
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">That's up to social services.
They'll be in touch with you.</font>

136
00:11:48,492 --> 00:11:51,284
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">They'll look after Sam.
Good luck to you.</font>

137
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,826
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">You have your orders.</font>

138
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,867
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Use the orienteering
and path-finding skills</font>

139
00:12:02,952 --> 00:12:04,536
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">that you've been
practicing all summer.</font>

140
00:12:04,619 --> 00:12:07,494
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Let's find our man,
bring him safely back to camp.</font>

141
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:09,786
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Remember, this isn't
just a search party,</font>

142
00:12:09,869 --> 00:12:11,994
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">it's a chance to do
some first class Scouting.</font>

143
00:12:12,077 --> 00:12:14,245
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Any questions?</font>

144
00:12:14,328 --> 00:12:15,453
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Lazy-Eye?</font>

145
00:12:15,537 --> 00:12:17,120
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">What's your real job, sir?</font>

146
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,994
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">- I'm a math teacher. Why?
- What grade?</font>

147
00:12:19,077 --> 00:12:20,786
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">- Eighth.
- You need a PhD for that?</font>

148
00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:22,203
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Lazy-Eye, no,
but you know what,</font>

149
00:12:22,287 --> 00:12:24,826
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">we're actually in the middle of something
here, in case you didn't notice.</font>

150
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,036
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">One of our Scouts is missing
and that's a crisis.</font>

151
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:28,162
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Anybody else?
Redford?</font>

152
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,328
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">What if he resists?</font>

153
00:12:29,412 --> 00:12:30,496
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">- Who?
- Shakusky.</font>

154
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:31,620
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Are we allowed to
use force on him?</font>

155
00:12:31,703 --> 00:12:35,869
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">No, you're not.
This is a non-violent, rescue operation.</font>

156
00:12:35,952 --> 00:12:39,329
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Your mission is to find him,
not to hurt him under any circumstances.</font>

157
00:12:39,413 --> 00:12:41,287
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Am I making
myself understood?</font>

158
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,163
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">- Yes.
- Good.</font>

159
00:12:44,704 --> 00:12:47,329
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I'm going to change my answer,
in fact, this is my real job.</font>

160
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:50,996
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Scout Master Troop 55.
I'm a math teacher on the side.</font>

161
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,829
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Be leery out there. Okay?</font>

162
00:12:53,913 --> 00:12:55,330
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Now let's get started.
Who's got Snoopy?</font>

163
00:12:55,414 --> 00:12:56,746
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Right here.</font>

164
00:12:57,246 --> 00:12:59,163
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Give him the scent.</font>

165
00:13:02,955 --> 00:13:04,997
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I heard he ran away
because his family died.</font>

166
00:13:05,372 --> 00:13:07,372
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I heard he
never had any family in the first place.</font>

167
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,788
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">That's probably
why he's crazy.</font>

168
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:09,997
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I'll tell you one thing,</font>

169
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,831
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">if we find him, I'm not going to be the
one who forgot to bring a weapon.</font>

170
00:13:12,915 --> 00:13:14,873
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Me, neither.</font>

171
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,001
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Camp Ivanhoe, that's all the way
across the other side of the island.</font>

172
00:14:06,084 --> 00:14:07,334
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">You really think
a 12-year-old boy</font>

173
00:14:07,418 --> 00:14:09,375
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">could row this far
in a miniature canoe?</font>

174
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:10,500
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Most likely not.</font>

175
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,041
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">It is possible, Counselor.</font>

176
00:14:12,124 --> 00:14:14,333
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I disagree, Counselor.
It would take him three days, at least.</font>

177
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:15,876
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I don't think so.
Two days, maximum.</font>

178
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,210
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">- Well, I'm not going to argue about it.
- Be that as it may,</font>

179
00:14:18,293 --> 00:14:19,272
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">- will you let me know if
you see anything unusual?</font>

180
00:14:19,273 --> 00:14:20,251
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">- Yup.</font>

181
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:32,170
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Scout Master's log,
September 2nd.</font>

182
00:15:32,253 --> 00:15:34,671
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">First day of search
party for Sam Shakusky</font>

183
00:15:35,046 --> 00:15:37,463
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Morale is extremely low,
in part, I suppose,</font>

184
00:15:37,547 --> 00:15:39,837
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">because Sam is
the least popular Scout in the troop.</font>

185
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,297
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">By a significant margin.</font>

186
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:46,673
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I'm confused
and I'm worried.</font>

187
00:15:48,256 --> 00:15:50,673
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Please let us
find him tomorrow.</font>

188
00:15:50,756 --> 00:15:54,089
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Please don't let
him fall off a cliff,</font>

189
00:15:54,172 --> 00:15:56,381
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">or drown in the goddamn
lake or something.</font>

190
00:15:56,464 --> 00:15:58,049
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">A terrible day
at Camp Ivanhoe.</font>

191
00:16:01,256 --> 00:16:02,924
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Let's hope
tomorrow's better.</font>

192
00:17:29,928 --> 00:17:32,178
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">One Year earlier</font>

193
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:02,517
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">What kind of bird are you?</font>

194
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,767
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I'm a sparrow,
she's a dove...</font>

195
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:10,016
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">No. I said,
what kind of bird are you?</font>

196
00:19:13,225 --> 00:19:14,475
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I'm a raven.</font>

197
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:17,017
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Boys aren't
allowed in here.</font>

198
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:19,767
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I'll be leaving soon.</font>

199
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,101
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">What happened to your hand?</font>

200
00:19:26,184 --> 00:19:27,893
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I got hit in the mirror.</font>

201
00:19:27,976 --> 00:19:29,727
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Really, how did that happen?</font>

202
00:19:31,018 --> 00:19:32,935
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I lost my temper at myself.</font>

203
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:37,518
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">What's your name?</font>

204
00:19:37,601 --> 00:19:38,852
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Sam. What's yours?</font>

205
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,686
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I'm Suzy.</font>

206
00:19:43,352 --> 00:19:44,768
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">It's not polite to stare.</font>

207
00:19:45,725 --> 00:19:47,477
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Birds, ready?
Who are you?</font>

208
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,102
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Where did you come from?
Go back to your seat.</font>

209
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:56,978
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">He likes you.</font>

210
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:31,605
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Were you followed?</font>

211
00:20:34,105 --> 00:20:35,605
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">- I doubt it.
- Good.</font>

212
00:20:38,145 --> 00:20:39,396
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Is that a cat in there?</font>

213
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:49,897
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">- Can you read a map?
- Uh-huh.</font>

214
00:20:50,272 --> 00:20:52,481
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I do cartography.</font>

215
00:20:52,565 --> 00:20:54,689
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I feel we should
go halfway today, and halfway tomorrow</font>

216
00:20:54,772 --> 00:20:56,190
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">since you're a less
experienced hiker,</font>

217
00:20:56,273 --> 00:20:58,316
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">and you're wearing
Sunday school shoes.</font>

218
00:20:58,398 --> 00:20:59,440
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">They're not really
Sunday school shoes.</font>

219
00:20:59,522 --> 00:21:00,566
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Here.</font>

220
00:21:00,648 --> 00:21:01,690
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Oh, thank you.</font>

221
00:21:04,272 --> 00:21:05,730
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Here's where
we are right now.</font>

222
00:21:05,814 --> 00:21:07,940
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I'd like to pitch
camp here by 1600,</font>

223
00:21:08,023 --> 00:21:09,856
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">which means 4:00.
How does that sound?</font>

224
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,856
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">- Fine.
- You want some beef jerky?</font>

225
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,356
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">- Okay.
- Let's go.</font>

226
00:21:26,191 --> 00:21:27,566
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Are you thirsty?</font>

227
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:29,025
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">No, thank you.</font>

228
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:31,192
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Well, if your throat
gets parched,</font>

229
00:21:31,275 --> 00:21:33,065
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">stick a pebble in your
mouth and suck on it.</font>

230
00:21:33,148 --> 00:21:35,024
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">You can quench your thirst
with the spit, supposedly.</font>

231
00:21:35,566 --> 00:21:36,608
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Mmm-hmm.</font>

232
00:21:37,274 --> 00:21:40,483
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Sometimes I stick leaves on my
hair. It helps cool your head down.</font>

233
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:41,607
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Hmm. That's a good idea.</font>

234
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:44,024
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">It might also help if
you didn't wear a fur hat.</font>

235
00:21:44,107 --> 00:21:46,067
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Yeah. True.</font>

236
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:50,651
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">You can go ahead.
Be careful.</font>

237
00:22:01,776 --> 00:22:03,525
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Here's a trick,
throw pine needles in the air</font>

238
00:22:03,608 --> 00:22:05,526
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">and you can see
which direction the wind is blowing.</font>

239
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:11,151
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Which Way?</font>

240
00:22:13,944 --> 00:22:15,070
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I guess it
doesn't really matter,</font>

241
00:22:15,153 --> 00:22:16,444
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">just as long as we
cover our tracks.</font>

242
00:22:27,943 --> 00:22:29,944
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">You smell like perfume.</font>

243
00:22:30,027 --> 00:22:31,445
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Oh, it's my mother's.</font>

244
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,860
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Hmm. Hmm.</font>

245
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:46,237
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I brought water, too.</font>

246
00:22:49,571 --> 00:22:51,237
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">- You wait here.
- Okay.</font>

247
00:22:52,486 --> 00:22:53,862
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Be right back.</font>

248
00:22:57,029 --> 00:22:58,237
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Watch your head!</font>

249
00:23:08,322 --> 00:23:09,696
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Where the hell is it?</font>

250
00:23:16,781 --> 00:23:18,072
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Found it!</font>

251
00:23:28,863 --> 00:23:29,989
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">It's ready.</font>

252
00:23:30,948 --> 00:23:33,448
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">He knows someone's
watching him.</font>

253
00:23:33,531 --> 00:23:37,114
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I agree. Wait.
Why do you say that?</font>

254
00:23:38,489 --> 00:23:41,324
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Mmm... I don't know,
I just think he can feel us.</font>

255
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,280
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Follow me.</font>

256
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,366
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">How strong of
a swimmer are you?</font>

257
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,200
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Pretty good.
I broke our school record for the backstroke.</font>

258
00:24:20,283 --> 00:24:23,866
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Okay. Well, I'm not that strong of a
swimmer, so I wear a life preserver.</font>

259
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:30,909
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Watch out for turtles.</font>

260
00:24:30,992 --> 00:24:33,492
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">They'll bite you
if you put your fingers down their mouths.</font>

261
00:24:33,576 --> 00:24:35,159
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

262
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:36,952
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Let me see if I
can catch this one.</font>

263
00:24:39,785 --> 00:24:41,285
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Feel something.</font>

264
00:24:46,076 --> 00:24:48,577
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Hmm... Somebody
wrote on him.</font>

265
00:24:49,703 --> 00:24:51,617
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">The stick's moving.</font>

266
00:24:51,701 --> 00:24:52,868
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">You got one!</font>

267
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,868
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Fish on hook!
Reel him in, slowly.</font>

268
00:25:06,661 --> 00:25:07,744
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Mmm.</font>

269
00:25:10,578 --> 00:25:13,577
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Very good.
You know a lot about camping, don't you?</font>

270
00:25:14,411 --> 00:25:18,537
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I'm a Khaki Scout. It's what I'm trained
for. Well, anyway, I used to be.</font>

271
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,037
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Maybe we can feed your cat
the guts and eyeballs.</font>

272
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,786
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Oh, that's okay.
He only eats kitten food.</font>

273
00:25:26,162 --> 00:25:27,204
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Oh.</font>

274
00:25:27,913 --> 00:25:30,622
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">What else did you bring?
Maybe we can make an inventory.</font>

275
00:25:31,455 --> 00:25:32,580
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

276
00:25:43,121 --> 00:25:44,162
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Go ahead.</font>

277
00:25:44,456 --> 00:25:47,206
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">This is my record player.
It works with batteries.</font>

278
00:25:47,288 --> 00:25:49,662
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Well, actually,
it belongs to my little brother, Lionel.</font>

279
00:25:49,747 --> 00:25:51,206
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">- I left him a note.
- Okay.</font>

280
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:53,164
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">- Do you like music?
- Yeah.</font>

281
00:25:54,247 --> 00:25:56,247
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">This is my
favorite record album.</font>

282
00:25:56,331 --> 00:25:58,331
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">My godmother gave it
to me for my birthday.</font>

283
00:25:58,414 --> 00:26:00,164
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">She lives in France.</font>

284
00:26:02,207 --> 00:26:05,581
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">These are my books.
I like stories with magic powers in them.</font>

285
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:08,122
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Either in kingdoms on Earth
or on foreign planets.</font>

286
00:26:08,205 --> 00:26:11,331
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Usually, I prefer
a girl hero, but not always.</font>

287
00:26:11,414 --> 00:26:13,540
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I couldn't bring them all
because it got too heavy.</font>

288
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:14,749
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">You can borrow any you want.</font>

289
00:26:14,832 --> 00:26:15,873
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Thank you.</font>

290
00:26:15,957 --> 00:26:20,832
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I also brought
my lefty scissors because I'm left-handed,</font>

291
00:26:20,915 --> 00:26:25,457
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">some rubber bands,
extra batteries, my toothbrush,</font>

292
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,624
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">and my binoculars,
as you know.</font>

293
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:27,749
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

294
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:30,041
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I forgot my comb.
But I'll use my fingers.</font>

295
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:36,457
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Huh.</font>

296
00:26:38,874 --> 00:26:42,749
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Wait, these are all
library books.</font>

297
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:46,750
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">In my school, you're only
allowed to check out one at a time.</font>

298
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:50,042
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Some of these are
going to be overdue.</font>

299
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:53,168
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Do you steal?</font>

300
00:26:55,749 --> 00:26:57,460
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Why? You're not poor.</font>

301
00:26:58,627 --> 00:27:02,334
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I might turn some of
them back in one day. I haven't decided yet.</font>

302
00:27:02,417 --> 00:27:06,000
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I know it's bad. I think I just took
them to have a secret to keep.</font>

303
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:07,750
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Anyway,
for some reason,</font>

304
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,500
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">it makes me feel in
a better mood sometimes.</font>

305
00:27:11,001 --> 00:27:12,711
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Are you depressed?</font>

306
00:27:14,459 --> 00:27:15,710
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">How come?</font>

307
00:27:15,793 --> 00:27:18,086
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Well, I can show you
an example, if you'd like,</font>

308
00:27:19,586 --> 00:27:21,836
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">but it doesn't make
me feel very good.</font>

309
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,253
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Anyway, I found this
on top of our refrigerator.</font>

310
00:27:27,626 --> 00:27:28,667
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Does that mean you?</font>

311
00:27:29,835 --> 00:27:31,210
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I think so.</font>

312
00:27:35,752 --> 00:27:36,793
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Are you laughing?</font>

313
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,211
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">It's not funny.</font>

314
00:27:44,962 --> 00:27:47,502
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">You really know
how to make friends.</font>

315
00:28:06,671 --> 00:28:07,714
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I'm sorry.</font>

316
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,879
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Oh. It's okay.</font>

317
00:28:11,213 --> 00:28:12,878
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I'm on your side.</font>

318
00:28:14,338 --> 00:28:15,671
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I know.</font>

319
00:28:20,754 --> 00:28:22,130
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Thank you.</font>

320
00:28:26,254 --> 00:28:28,672
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Which one's the best?</font>

321
00:28:28,755 --> 00:28:32,922
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">"His eyes downcast, his kingdom in
ruins, Mynar pressed his heavy paw</font>

322
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:34,963
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">"through the rippling surface
of the cool shallows</font>

323
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,673
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">"and down to its stone floor.</font>

324
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:39,840
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">"My people once were led
by a great and noble beast</font>

325
00:28:39,923 --> 00:28:43,130
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">"and I no longer
see his face in this reflection.'</font>

326
00:28:57,841 --> 00:29:01,091
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">"Meanwhile,
on the Plains of Tabitha, Francine rested.</font>

327
00:29:01,174 --> 00:29:03,133
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">"There would be
another time for war."</font>

328
00:29:05,924 --> 00:29:08,633
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Suzy! Dinner! I'm not
going to say it again.</font>

329
00:29:10,968 --> 00:29:12,425
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Where's your sister?</font>

330
00:29:12,508 --> 00:29:16,842
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I don't know, but she borrowed
my record player for 10 days without asking.</font>

331
00:29:16,925 --> 00:29:19,592
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">What does that mean?</font>

332
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:22,093
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Dear Lionel, I need
to use your record player.</font>

333
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:25,717
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I will give it back
in 10 days or less. Do not tell Mom. Or Dad.</font>

334
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,008
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I will replace the batteries when I
return. Signed, Suzy Bishop.</font>

335
00:29:31,968 --> 00:29:33,551
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Walt! Where the hell are you?</font>

336
00:29:33,634 --> 00:29:34,759
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Right here!</font>

337
00:29:34,843 --> 00:29:36,759
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Why are you cursing at me?</font>

338
00:29:36,843 --> 00:29:39,509
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Does it concern you that
your daughter's just run away from home?</font>

339
00:29:42,677 --> 00:29:43,970
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">That's a loaded question.</font>

340
00:29:44,469 --> 00:29:45,801
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Come down and read this.</font>

341
00:29:46,467 --> 00:29:49,092
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Scout Master Ward
confirms they've had no luck.</font>

342
00:29:49,175 --> 00:29:50,218
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">They're going home for...</font>

343
00:29:53,343 --> 00:29:54,384
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Who's there?</font>

344
00:29:59,427 --> 00:30:02,177
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Good evening.
Sorry to startle you.</font>

345
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,803
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">What are you doing here?
Nobody called the police.</font>

346
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,178
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I know. Uh...
I know.</font>

347
00:30:07,261 --> 00:30:09,678
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">The search party's
not over yet. In other words...</font>

348
00:30:09,761 --> 00:30:11,928
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Suzy's missing, too!
Go find her.</font>

349
00:30:14,928 --> 00:30:17,179
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">The tropical cyclone,
which originated last week</font>

350
00:30:17,262 --> 00:30:20,096
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">off the coast of
British Honduras, has intensified rapidly</font>

351
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:22,762
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">and is now designated
Hurricane Mabeline.</font>

352
00:30:22,845 --> 00:30:24,553
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Stay tuned for
further information</font>

353
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:34,471
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">How can we help her?
She's got so many problems.</font>

354
00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:36,972
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">It's getting worse.</font>

355
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:40,263
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Whose fault is it?</font>

356
00:30:40,347 --> 00:30:41,471
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I don't know.</font>

357
00:30:42,222 --> 00:30:44,971
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">But just for the record
95 % of all runaways</font>

358
00:30:45,054 --> 00:30:46,929
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">return home within
the first six hours.</font>

359
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:50,513
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">That doesn't do you
any good right now. It's just a statistic.</font>

360
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,389
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">But in all likelihood,
Suzy's probably hiding in the closet</font>

361
00:30:53,473 --> 00:30:55,764
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">at her best friend's house
playing Chinese checkers</font>

362
00:30:55,848 --> 00:30:58,179
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">at this very moment,
as we speak.</font>

363
00:30:58,262 --> 00:31:00,472
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">She doesn't have any friends.</font>

364
00:31:01,973 --> 00:31:03,348
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">How's Laura?</font>

365
00:31:06,555 --> 00:31:07,931
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">"How's Laura?"</font>

366
00:31:08,014 --> 00:31:09,556
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Mrs. Bishop, I mean.</font>

367
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:12,224
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I don't understand.</font>

368
00:31:12,307 --> 00:31:13,681
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Is she upset?</font>

369
00:31:28,098 --> 00:31:29,474
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">There's a porcupine.</font>

370
00:31:38,973 --> 00:31:43,557
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">She has a pen pal! It's very intimate.
They planned this together.</font>

371
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:47,849
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Sam Shakusky.
That's my escaped Khaki Scout.</font>

00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,100
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Holy Christ,
what am I looking at?</font>

00:31:51,183 --> 00:31:54,516
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">He does watercolors.
Mostly landscapes, but a few nudes.</font>

375
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,641
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">She sit for this?</font>

376
00:31:55,725 --> 00:31:56,767
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">What's he say?</font>

377
00:31:59,352 --> 00:32:01,558
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Dear Suzy,
you have a superb voice.</font>

378
00:32:01,641 --> 00:32:03,933
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">You were my favorite animal
in the program, by far.</font>

379
00:32:04,016 --> 00:32:05,351
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Please find enclosed...</font>

380
00:32:05,433 --> 00:32:07,100
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Dear Sam,
thank you very much.</font>

381
00:32:07,183 --> 00:32:09,933
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I got replaced as the raven
because I yelled at Mrs. Lynn.</font>

382
00:32:10,016 --> 00:32:11,767
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">After that,
I was only a blue jay, but...</font>

383
00:32:11,851 --> 00:32:14,684
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Dear Suzy, I'm sorry
that your brothers are so selfish.</font>

384
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,143
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Maybe they will
grow out of it.</font>

385
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:18,727
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Sometimes people do things
without knowing the reasons for...</font>

386
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,560
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Dear Sam, you are
an excellent painter,</font>

387
00:32:20,643 --> 00:32:22,352
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">especially trees
and telephone poles.</font>

388
00:32:22,435 --> 00:32:25,518
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Is the girl in the water supposed to be
me? My favorite color is...</font>

389
00:32:25,602 --> 00:32:29,310
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Dear Suzy, I accidentally built a
fire while I was sleepwalking.</font>

390
00:32:29,395 --> 00:32:32,519
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I have no memory of this,
but my foster parents think I am lying.</font>

391
00:32:32,603 --> 00:32:33,643
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Unfortunately, it is...</font>

392
00:32:33,727 --> 00:32:35,727
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Dear Sam,
I am in trouble again</font>

393
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,310
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">because I threw a rock
through the window.</font>

394
00:32:37,392 --> 00:32:39,810
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">My mother still has
glass in her hair. Also...</font>

395
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:42,394
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Dear Suzy, I have been
trying very hard to make friends,</font>

396
00:32:42,478 --> 00:32:44,936
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">but I feel people do
not like my personality.</font>

397
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:46,853
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">In fact, I can understand
why they might not...</font>

398
00:32:46,936 --> 00:32:48,854
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Dear Sam,
now I am getting suspended</font>

399
00:32:48,937 --> 00:32:50,437
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">because I got in
a fight with Molly.</font>

400
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,520
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">She says I go berserk.
Our principal is against me. Why do some...</font>

401
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:55,937
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Dear Suzy, I know your parents
hurt' your feelings,</font>

402
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,019
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">but they still love you.
That is more important. If they...</font>

403
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:00,769
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Dear Sam,
I do think you should</font>

404
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,019
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">think of their
faces every day,</font>

405
00:33:02,103 --> 00:33:03,562
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">even if it makes you sad.</font>

406
00:33:03,645 --> 00:33:05,103
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">It is too bad they
did not leave you</font>

407
00:33:05,188 --> 00:33:07,103
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">more pictures of themselves.
Can you...</font>

408
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:09,104
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Dear Suzy, here is my plan.</font>

409
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,188
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Dear Sam, my answer is yes.</font>

410
00:33:11,271 --> 00:33:12,687
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Dear Suzy, when?</font>

411
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:14,355
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Dear Sam, where?</font>

412
00:33:14,438 --> 00:33:17,938
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Dear Suzy,
walk 400 yards due north from your house</font>

413
00:33:18,021 --> 00:33:20,563
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">to the dirt path
which has not got any name on it.</font>

414
00:33:20,646 --> 00:33:24,523
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Turn right and follow to the
end. I will meet you in the meadow.</font>

415
00:33:32,313 --> 00:33:34,606
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Gee whiz, what do you
suppose happened to him?</font>

416
00:33:34,688 --> 00:33:38,105
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I'm not sure.
I think he went searching in the dark.</font>

417
00:33:38,188 --> 00:33:41,148
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">She stole the batteries
out of my flashlight.</font>

418
00:33:41,232 --> 00:33:43,773
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Stole the batteries
out of the flashlight...</font>

419
00:33:45,939 --> 00:33:47,190
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I think he's onto us.</font>

420
00:33:47,273 --> 00:33:48,482
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Of course he is.</font>

421
00:33:48,565 --> 00:33:49,064
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Of course he is?</font>

422
00:33:49,816 --> 00:33:50,898
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Of course he is.</font>

423
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,940
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Then why aren't we
worried about that?</font>

424
00:33:55,023 --> 00:33:56,648
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I am.</font>

425
00:33:56,731 --> 00:33:58,357
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Well, I didn't know.</font>

426
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,815
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Or, anyway,
I thought maybe I was wrong.</font>

427
00:34:01,898 --> 00:34:02,939
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Did you hit him?</font>

428
00:34:03,022 --> 00:34:04,148
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">No. He fell in a ditch.</font>

429
00:34:04,232 --> 00:34:08,858
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Hey! Cat food!
I think it's a clue.</font>

430
00:34:13,315 --> 00:34:14,691
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">That's her.</font>

431
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:18,024
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Where's he going?</font>

432
00:34:18,816 --> 00:34:20,275
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I don't know.</font>

433
00:34:21,816 --> 00:34:23,483
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">All right,
we know they're together.</font>

434
00:34:23,566 --> 00:34:25,774
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">We know they're within
a certain radius of this spot.</font>

435
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:28,109
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I'm declaring a case
with the county right now.</font>

436
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:31,692
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Until help arrives, I'm deputizing
the little guy, the skinny one,</font>

437
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:33,191
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">and the boy with
the patch on his eye</font>

438
00:34:33,274 --> 00:34:34,609
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">to come with me in
the station wagon.</font>

439
00:34:34,692 --> 00:34:37,775
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Randy, you drop in and head up
river with the rest of your troops,</font>

440
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:39,110
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">split up on foot.</font>

441
00:34:39,193 --> 00:34:41,275
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Becky, call Jed,
tell him to circle over</font>

442
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,818
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">this end of the island
and fly low.</font>

443
00:34:56,276 --> 00:34:57,359
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Is it them?</font>

444
00:34:57,442 --> 00:34:58,485
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Yeah, yeah.</font>

445
00:34:59,651 --> 00:35:00,944
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">They found the campfire.</font>

446
00:35:01,027 --> 00:35:05,861
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Rats! I should have put
more pine needles on it. Let's go.</font>

447
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:13,445
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Be careful.</font>

448
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,195
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">What do you creeps want?</font>

449
00:35:46,987 --> 00:35:48,404
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">We're looking for you.</font>

450
00:35:49,363 --> 00:35:50,487
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Why?</font>

451
00:35:51,072 --> 00:35:52,446
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Well, because
you're a fugitive.</font>

452
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:54,779
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">No, I'm not.
I quit the Khaki Scouts.</font>

453
00:35:54,863 --> 00:35:57,279
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Well, it doesn't matter
anyway. You don't have that authority.</font>

454
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,654
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">We've been deputized.</font>

455
00:35:58,738 --> 00:36:01,990
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Now, you're going to come
along peacefully or not?</font>

456
00:36:05,155 --> 00:36:06,447
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Listen to some reason.</font>

457
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,615
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I don't like you.
You don't like me.</font>

458
00:36:08,698 --> 00:36:11,405
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">So, why don't you
just let us disappear?</font>

459
00:36:12,363 --> 00:36:15,279
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Well, it's tempting,
but we can't allow it.</font>

460
00:36:16,405 --> 00:36:17,697
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">You know,
you shouldn't be friends with him.</font>

461
00:36:18,531 --> 00:36:19,573
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Why not?</font>

462
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,448
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Because he's crazy.</font>

463
00:36:22,698 --> 00:36:24,366
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Maybe you just
don't know him.</font>

464
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:27,615
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Actually, we know him
a lot better than you.</font>

465
00:36:27,698 --> 00:36:29,616
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">He's emotionally disturbed
because his family died.</font>

466
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:31,406
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Nickleby, tie him up.</font>

467
00:36:34,908 --> 00:36:40,324
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Do not cross this stick.</font>

468
00:36:48,156 --> 00:36:49,657
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">You're doomed, Shakusky.</font>

469
00:37:26,451 --> 00:37:28,785
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Molly's right,
I do go berserk.</font>

470
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,745
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">It was him or us.</font>

471
00:37:37,284 --> 00:37:38,452
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Oh, no.</font>

472
00:37:43,284 --> 00:37:45,452
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">She stabbed
Redford in the back with lefty scissors.</font>

473
00:37:45,535 --> 00:37:47,202
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Repeat that, please? Over.</font>

474
00:37:47,285 --> 00:37:50,453
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Puncture wound, lower lumbar.
Make room for a stretcher in the cockpit.</font>

475
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,079
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">You're going to be okay.</font>

476
00:37:52,162 --> 00:37:55,120
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Thank goodness she
missed the artery. Here, bite on this.</font>

477
00:37:55,203 --> 00:37:57,035
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I tried to chop him,
but he dodged my tomahawk.</font>

478
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,620
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">He's got
excellent marksmanship.</font>

479
00:37:58,704 --> 00:37:59,911
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Shot Deluca in both arms.</font>

480
00:37:59,995 --> 00:38:02,286
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I guess we're going to miss
the Hullabaloo after all.</font>

481
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,703
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Where's Snoopy?</font>

482
00:38:04,994 --> 00:38:06,995
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Those sons of bitches.</font>

483
00:38:07,078 --> 00:38:09,661
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">They got him right
through the neck.</font>

484
00:38:11,662 --> 00:38:13,329
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Was he a good dog?</font>

485
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:19,037
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Who's to say.
But he didn't deserve to die.</font>

486
00:38:35,163 --> 00:38:36,289
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">What happened?
Who is that?</font>

487
00:38:36,373 --> 00:38:37,455
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Clear the dock, Edgar!</font>

488
00:38:37,538 --> 00:38:39,122
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">- Why is he bleeding?
- Is Suzy with you?</font>

489
00:38:39,205 --> 00:38:40,913
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">No, she's in
the woods with Shakusky.</font>

490
00:38:40,997 --> 00:38:42,039
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Where am I going?</font>

491
00:38:42,123 --> 00:38:45,039
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">The infirmary at Fort Lebanon.
We'll be right behind you. You got it?</font>

492
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:46,248
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Yup.</font>

493
00:38:46,331 --> 00:38:47,624
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Warm up the motor,
I'll be right back.</font>

494
00:38:47,707 --> 00:38:48,997
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Hold it right there!</font>

495
00:38:49,998 --> 00:38:51,164
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">You're not
leaving this island.</font>

496

<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Are your ears pierced?</font>

542
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:34,051
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">It's pretty.</font>

<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Why do you
always use binoculars?</font>

545
00:42:50,886 --> 00:42:54,219
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">It helps me see things
closer, even if they're not very far away.</font>

548
00:42:58,595 --> 00:43:00,513
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">That sounds like poetry.</font>

<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I don't know.
I want to go on adventures, I think.</font>

553
00:43:16,137 --> 00:43:18,970
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Not get stuck in one place.
How about you?</font>

554
00:43:21,263 --> 00:43:24,720
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Go on adventures, too.
Not get stuck, too.</font>

562
00:43:46,596 --> 00:43:48,305
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">What's that one for?</font>

563
00:43:48,389 --> 00:43:49,764

- Yeah.</font>

00:49:42,657 --> 00:49:45,826
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I would have given
you a commendable.</font>

622
00:49:45,909 --> 00:49:48,034
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">That was one of the
best pitched campsites I've ever seen.</font>

623
00:49:48,116 --> 00:49:49,242
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Honestly.</font>

624
00:49:49,325 --> 00:49:50,658
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Thank you.</font>

625
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,284
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">You don't want to be
a Khaki Scout anymore?</font>

626
00:50:09,118 --> 00:50:10,159
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Hello, Becky?</font>

627
00:50:10,242 --> 00:50:13,493
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Judy, I have your
person-to-person from New Penzance.</font>

628
00:50:13,576 --> 00:50:14,618
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Go ahead, New Penzance.</font>

629
00:50:15,243 --> 00:50:16,744
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Hello, this is
Captain Sharp.</font>

630
00:50:16,826 --> 00:50:19,202
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Hello, Captain Sharp.
This is Social Services.</font>

631
00:50:19,286 --> 00:50:21,870
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I'm calling in
reference to Sam Shakusky, ward of the state.</font>

632
00:50:21,953 --> 00:50:23,119
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I understand he's
in your custody.</font>

633
00:50:23,202 --> 00:50:24,328
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">That's correct.</font>

634
00:50:24,412 --> 00:50:26,243
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">What's his condition?
Has he suffered</font>

635
00:50:26,326 --> 00:50:28,577
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">any injury or
trauma of any kind?</font>

636
00:50:28,661 --> 00:50:30,411
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">- He's fine.
- Very good.</font>

637
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:31,827
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">How do I get to you?</font>

638
00:50:31,911 --> 00:50:33,452
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">The fastest way
would be sea plane.</font>

639
00:50:33,577 --> 00:50:35,118
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Jed can bring you
in with the mail.</font>

640
00:50:35,201 --> 00:50:37,119
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I'll come tomorrow morning,
if that's acceptable to you.</font>

641
00:50:37,202 --> 00:50:38,994
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Is someone able to
provide reasonable care</font>

642
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,702
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">and nourishment for
the boy until that time?</font>

643
00:50:41,328 --> 00:50:42,412
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Uh-huh.</font>

644
00:50:42,912 --> 00:50:43,954
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Is that a yes?</font>

645
00:50:44,328 --> 00:50:45,411
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Uh-huh.</font>

646
00:50:47,162 --> 00:50:49,995
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Very good, I'll contact you
again before the end of the day.</font>

647
00:50:50,078 --> 00:50:51,162
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Wait a second.</font>

648
00:50:51,245 --> 00:50:52,454
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Yes?</font>

649
00:50:52,538 --> 00:50:53,703
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Social Services?</font>

650
00:50:53,787 --> 00:50:54,996
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Captain Sharp?</font>

651
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,953
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">What's going to
happen to him?</font>

652
00:51:00,413 --> 00:51:03,746
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Well, normally,
we try to place him in another foster home,</font>

653
00:51:03,829 --> 00:51:05,955
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">but that option's no
longer available to us,</font>

654
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:08,245
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">in my opinion,
due to his case history.</font>

655
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:10,579
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Which means he'll go
to Juvenile Refuge.</font>

656
00:51:10,995 --> 00:51:13,496
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Wait. What does that mean?
Is that an orphanage?</font>

657
00:51:14,164 --> 00:51:15,205
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Who's speaking?</font>

658
00:51:15,622 --> 00:51:17,373
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">This is Scout Master
Randy Ward.</font>

659
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:21,413
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Right, an orphanage.</font>

660
00:51:25,455 --> 00:51:28,331
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">But the first step is
the admissions panel</font>

661
00:51:28,414 --> 00:51:30,079
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">requires
a psychological evaluation</font>

662
00:51:30,163 --> 00:51:32,580
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">to determine
whether or not the boy</font>

663
00:51:32,664 --> 00:51:34,623
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">is a candidate for
institutional treatment</font>

664
00:51:34,706 --> 00:51:37,248
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">or electroshock therapy.</font>

665
00:51:37,331 --> 00:51:39,332
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Excuse me.
Shock therapy?</font>

666
00:51:39,416 --> 00:51:41,582
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Why would that
be called for? He's not violent.</font>

667
00:51:42,081 --> 00:51:44,582
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">The report describes
an assault with scissors.</font>

668
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:45,832
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">That was the girl.</font>

669
00:51:45,916 --> 00:51:47,083
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">That was the girl
that did that.</font>

670
00:51:47,624 --> 00:51:52,665
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Well, maybe she needs help,
too, but that's not our job. Okay?</font>

671
00:51:56,456 --> 00:51:57,498
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

672
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,543
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I'll be out back.</font>

673
00:52:36,918 --> 00:52:39,585
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I'm going to find
a tree to chop down.</font>

674
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,627
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I do know what
you're feeling, Suzy-bean.</font>

675
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:51,669
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I've had moments
myself where I say, "What am I doing here?</font>

676
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,211
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">"Who made this decision?</font>

677
00:52:54,044 --> 00:52:57,210
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">"How could I allow myself
to do something so stupid?</font>

678
00:52:57,294 --> 00:52:59,627
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">"And why is it
still happening?"</font>

679
00:53:01,461 --> 00:53:04,795
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">We women are more emotional...
I hate you.</font>

680
00:53:05,836 --> 00:53:07,129
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Don't say "hate."</font>

681
00:53:07,212 --> 00:53:08,670
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Why not? I mean it.</font>

682
00:53:09,544 --> 00:53:12,711
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">You think you mean it,
in this moment. You're trying to hurt me.</font>

683
00:53:12,795 --> 00:53:14,003
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Exactly.</font>

684
00:53:15,461 --> 00:53:18,711
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I know what you do
with that sad, dumb policeman.</font>

685
00:53:25,545 --> 00:53:27,087
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">He's not dumb.</font>

686
00:53:28,087 --> 00:53:30,337
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">But I guess
he is kind of sad.</font>

687
00:53:32,212 --> 00:53:33,712
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Anyway,
we shouldn't discuss that.</font>

688
00:53:33,796 --> 00:53:35,712
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">It's not appropriate
for me to even acknowledge</font>

689
00:53:35,797 --> 00:53:38,297
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">what I already just said.</font>

690
00:53:48,129 --> 00:53:49,463
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Poor Suzy.</font>

691
00:53:51,548 --> 00:53:54,005
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Why is everything
so hard for you?</font>

692
00:53:55,672 --> 00:54:00,673
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">We're in love. We just want to be
together. What's wrong with that?</font>

693
00:54:05,756 --> 00:54:10,714
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Oh, my God! How are we going to
get these fish hooks out?</font>

694
00:54:14,006 --> 00:54:17,214
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I admit we knew
we'd get in trouble. That part's true.</font>

695
00:54:17,673 --> 00:54:21,258
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">We knew people would be
worried, and we still ran away, anyway.</font>

696
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:24,633
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">But something also happened,
which we didn't do on purpose.</font>

697
00:54:24,716 --> 00:54:28,882
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">When we first met each other,
something happened to us.</font>

698
00:54:30,465 --> 00:54:31,840
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">That's very eloquent.</font>

699
00:54:32,467 --> 00:54:34,756
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I can't argue against
anything you're saying.</font>

700
00:54:35,425 --> 00:54:38,590
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">But then again,
I don't have to, 'cause you're 12 years old.</font>

701
00:54:40,883 --> 00:54:43,800
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Look, let's face it.</font>

702
00:54:45,425 --> 00:54:49,009
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">You're probably a much more
intelligent person than I am.</font>

703
00:54:49,883 --> 00:54:52,051
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">In fact,
I guarantee it.</font>

704
00:54:52,134 --> 00:54:53,966
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">But even smart kids
stick their finger</font>

705
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:55,634
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">in electrical
sockets sometimes.</font>

706
00:54:57,593 --> 00:55:00,010
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">It takes time to
figure things out.</font>

707
00:55:00,717 --> 00:55:04,259
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">It's been proven by history.
All mankind makes mistakes.</font>

708
00:55:06,259 --> 00:55:07,592
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">It's our job to
try to protect you</font>

709
00:55:07,676 --> 00:55:10,885
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">from making the
dangerous ones, if we can.</font>

710
00:55:10,968 --> 00:55:12,634
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">You want a slug?</font>

711
00:55:22,968 --> 00:55:24,719
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">What's your rush?</font>

712
00:55:24,803 --> 00:55:28,386
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">You've got your whole life
in front of yourself.</font>

713
00:55:28,469 --> 00:55:29,842
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Ahead of you, I mean.</font>

714
00:55:30,178 --> 00:55:32,717
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Maybe so.
Anyway, you're a bachelor.</font>

715
00:55:34,177 --> 00:55:35,218
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">So are you.</font>

716
00:55:35,302 --> 00:55:36,344
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">That's true.</font>

717
00:55:39,136 --> 00:55:41,093
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Did you love someone ever?</font>

718
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:44,469
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Yes, I did.</font>

719
00:55:44,553 --> 00:55:45,719
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">What happened?</font>

720
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:49,303
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">She didn't love me back.</font>

721
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:50,845
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Ah.</font>

722
00:55:53,845 --> 00:55:56,844
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I'm sorry for your loss.</font>

723
00:55:56,928 --> 00:55:58,719
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Anyway, that's what
you're supposed to say.</font>

724
00:56:23,806 --> 00:56:25,556
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Scout Master's log.
September 4th.</font>

725
00:56:44,807 --> 00:56:46,390
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I heard he's going
to reform school.</font>

726
00:56:46,473 --> 00:56:48,348
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I heard that they're
going to take out a piece of his brain,</font>

727
00:56:48,432 --> 00:56:49,931
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">send him to
an insane asylum.</font>

728
00:56:50,014 --> 00:56:51,140
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I like his girl.</font>

729
00:56:51,223 --> 00:56:52,306
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">She's too scruffy for me.</font>

730
00:56:52,389 --> 00:56:53,598
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Supposedly,
they got to third base.</font>

731
00:56:53,681 --> 00:56:55,181
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">That's not true.
He just felt her up.</font>

732
00:56:55,264 --> 00:56:56,307
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Over shirt or under shirt?</font>

733
00:56:58,222 --> 00:56:59,473
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Damn us.</font>

734
00:57:03,307 --> 00:57:05,308
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">It's none of our business.</font>

735
00:57:10,516 --> 00:57:14,516
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">This troop has been
very shabby to Field Mate Sam Shakusky.</font>

736
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:17,474
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">In fact, we've been
a bunch of mean jerks.</font>

737
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:22,848
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Why's he so unpopular?</font>

738
00:57:23,683 --> 00:57:26,225
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">I admit, supposedly,
he's emotionally disturbed,</font>

739
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:30,809
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">but he's also
a disadvantaged orphan. How would you feel?</font>

740
00:57:30,892 --> 00:57:31,976
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Nickleby?</font>

741
00:57:32,809 --> 00:57:33,849
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Deluca?</font>

742
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:35,600
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Lazy-Eye?</font>

743
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,143
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Gadge?</font>

744
00:57:37,809 --> 00:57:40,893
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">He's a fellow Khaki Scout,
and he needs our help.</font>

What do you need?</font>

749
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:58,725
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">For starters?
Three yards of chicken wire,</font>

750
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:01,060
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">some ripped up newspapers,
and a bucket of wheat paste.</font>

<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">In other words, it's over.</font>

752
00:58:31,145 --> 00:58:34,939

755
00:58:38,604 --> 00:58:39,645

I think you will.</font>

We're going to get you off this island.</font>

This is an emergency rescue.</font>

778
01:00:52,277 --> 01:00:54,111
<font face="Arial" color="#ffff00">Normally, I'd say no.</font>

another note for Lionel?</font>
