1
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,860
My name is Richard.

2
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,220
So what else
do you need to know...

3
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,100
stuff about my family
or where i'm from?

4
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,660
None of that matters...

5
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,780
not once you cross the ocean
and cut your self loose

6
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,060
looking for something
more beautiful,

7
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,020
something more exciting...

8
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,580
and, yes, i admit...

9
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,100
something more dangerous.

10
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,420
So after 1 8 hours
in the back of an airplane,

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,980
3 dumb movies,
2 plastic meals, 6 beers,

12
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,820
and absolutely no sleep...

13
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,260
i finally touched down...

14
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,260
Hey, you!
How aboutyou?

15
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,220
in Bangkok.

16
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,340
Want to go to
the waterfall?

17
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,580
Come on!
Floating market!

18
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,060
1 ,500!
Cheap foryou!

19
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,100
Come on! Hey!

20
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,260
Hey, you need
somewhere to stay?

21
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,380
No. i'll be fine.

22
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,500
i'll find my own place.
Thanks.

23
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,580
What do you want,
man?

24
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,540
And this is it--

25
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,180
Bangkok:

26
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,780
good-time city,

27
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,860
gateway to southeast Asia,

28
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,620
where dollars
and deutschmarks

29
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,500
get turned into
counterfeit watches

30
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,980
and genuine scars.

31
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:32,940
Good time!

32
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,380
Boy, girl, fucking.
No problem.

33
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,300
This is where the hungry
come to feed.

34
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,180
You want to drink
snake blood?

35
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,180
Wait a minute.

36
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,260
Did you say snake blood?

37
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,340
Oh, yeah.

38
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,100
No, thanks.

39
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,660
What is wrong
with snake blood?

40
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,780
i just don't like the idea.

41
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,620
Oh, maybe
you're scared.

42
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,780
Afraid of somethin' new?

43
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,820
No. i just don't like
the idea, that's all.

44
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,300
Ha! Like every tourist--

45
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,580
you want it all be safe,
just like America.

46
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,540
Richard: So never
refuse an invitation.

47
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,740
Never resist the unfamiliar.

48
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,740
Uhh!

49
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,820
Never fail
to be polite...

50
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,100
Gentlemen...

51
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,860
that was excellent.

52
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,740
And never
out stay your welcome.

53
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,900
Just keep your mind open
and suck in the experience,

54
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,900
and if it hurts...

55
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,460
it's probably worth it.

56
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,620
Hey.

57
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,660
Good evening.

58
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,700
Hi.

59
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,900
Can i get a room, please?

60
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,860
Yes.

61
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,020
Man: Roger. They need
some napalm down there

62
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,300
at tree line.

63
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,020
Can you try
and put it down there?

64
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,100
Richard: The only downer

65
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,260
is everyone's
got the same idea.

66
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,180
We all travel thousands
of miles just to watch TV

67
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,220
and check into somewhere
with all the comforts ofhome.

68
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,540
And you gotta
ask yourself...

69
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,620
Don't worry, man!

70
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,780
We'll have this place
cleaned up and ready

71
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,380
for us in a jiffy,
so don't you worry!

72
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,380
what is the point of that?

73
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,060
Ahem!

74
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,820
Et voila.

75
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,780
Thank you.

76
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,220
Bonsoir.

77
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,860
Bonsoir.

78
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,460
Good night.

79
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,580
And as for traveling alone,

80
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,740
fuck it.

81
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,140
if that's the way
it has to be,

82
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,900
then that's the way it is.

83
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,740
Everybody happy!

84
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,020
Man: Everybody havin'
a good time, eh?

85
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,140
Fuckyou!

86
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,260
Fuckyou!

87
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,060
Woman: Please
shut up, okay?

88
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,980
Bastard parasites!

89
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,940
Parasites!

90
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,980
Yeah. That's fucking great!

91
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,140
Cancers! Bastard cancers!

92
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,140
Whoo...

93
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,180
Waah!

94
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,140
Woman: Ah!

95
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,580
Man: Waah!

96
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,100
The big, chunky charlie

97
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,780
is eatin' up
the whole fuckin' world!

98
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,820
Man: Hey!

99
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,300
Hey, you!

100
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,460
You got anything
to smoke?

101
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,500
No, i don't have
anything to smoke.

102
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,300
That's no problem,
pal, 'cause, uh...

103
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,540
i've got loads
ofthe fucking stuff.

104
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,460
Oh!

105
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,980
You understand
what i'm sayin'?

106
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,060
Yeah.

107
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,340
No, you don't.

108
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,940
No, you're right.
i don't.

109
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,500
Ah!

110
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,300
That's better!

111
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,420
Thanks.

112
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,500
it was the beach...

113
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,100
you understand?

114
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,700
The beach?

115
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,660
it was too...

116
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,500
beautiful, too much input,
too much...sensation.

117
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,740
i tried to keep it
under control,

118
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,940
but it just
keeps spilling out

119
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,420
and spilling out
and spilling out.

120
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,020
Right.

121
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,420
You see, um...

122
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,620
she's on an island...

123
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,780
and that island is--

124
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,980
is perfect. i mean--

125
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,780
i mean real perfection,
you know?

126
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,500
i'm not just talkin' about...

127
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,100
"Oh, that's nice."

128
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,620
it's the real
fucking deal, okay?

129
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,980
Perfect.

130
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,900
it's just like a--
a lagoon, you know,

131
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,540
A tidal lagoon

132
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,500
that's sealed in
by cliffs,

133
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,420
totally fuckin' secret,
totally fuckin'...

134
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,340
forbidden.

135
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,180
And nobody can ever,
ever, ever, ever go there.

136
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,100
Ever.

137
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,540
But a few people went...

138
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,780
once upon a time...

139
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,540
men and women with ideals,

140
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,820
you understand?

141
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,300
i'm not just talkin'
about the usual travelin',

142
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,060
fucking wanks.

143
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,140
Do you believe
in that place?

144
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,500
No.

145
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,020
But i guess
you're gonna tell me

146
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,540
that i should, right?

147
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,340
it doesn't even fucking matter
what i think anymore.

148
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,300
it's up toyou.

149
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,860
ideals, eh?

150
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,180
We were just
fucking parasites!

151
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,540
The big, chunky charlie!

152
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:02,100
See, i was the one that
was tryin' to find the cure.

153
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,100
Procurer of the cure.

154
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,580
And i said to them,
"You've got to leave.

155
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,300
You've got to leave
this place."

156
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,860
But they wouldn't listen.

157
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,300
No offense and all,

158
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,340
but...

159
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,180
you're fucked
in the head, right?

160
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,900
There, Richard.

161
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,300
it's been nice
knowin' ya, man.

162
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,860
Yeah. You, too.

163
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,900
Be careful!

164
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,860
Electric--
Electricity!

165
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,060
Ma'am!

166
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,020
Ma'am!

167
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Bzzzz!

168
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,220
Chill, man. No worry.

169
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,500
Hey, man,

170
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,580
there is a letter
foryou.

171
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,460
A what?

172
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,260
Letter on your door.

173
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,260
No fuckin' way.

174
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,780
Doyou...

175
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,060
Hello?

176
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,940
Richard: You hope...

177
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,180
and you dream.

178
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,380
But you never believe

179
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,980
that something's
gonna happen for you,

180
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,820
not like it does
in the movies.

181
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,780
And when it actually does...

182
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,580
you want it
to feel different...

183
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,380
more visceral...

184
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,780
more real.

185
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,500
i was waiting for it
to hit me...

186
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,860
but it just wouldn't happen.

187
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,660
A name
of Mr. Daffy Duck.

188
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,620
Birthplace--
Never-Never Land?

189
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,900
Gonna fuck up
all the paperwork.

190
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,420
The police were pissed

191
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,460
because he was traveling
under a false passport.

192
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,980
Go ahead.
Sign the statement.

193
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,460
it's okay.

194
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,540
it just say
he cut his wrists,

195
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,580
already dead
when you found him.

196
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,100
But they didn't ask me
about the map, so...

197
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,460
No problem.

198
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,340
i didn't tell 'em.

199
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,020
You have a nice day.

200
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,980
Good luck.

201
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,020
Excuse me.

202
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,380
Look, i mean...

203
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,900
this island may not
actually even exist,

204
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,020
and even if it does,

205
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,620
i don't even know
if we can get there or not.

206
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,820
i just wondered if you
wanted to come with me.

207
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,900
That's all.

208
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,980
Hey, you wanna take a hike?

209
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,820
Uh, a trip, a journey...

210
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,540
with your girlfriend

211
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,540
and me?

212
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,860
i mean, the two of you
and me, together?

213
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,220
i'm talking about
the secret island.

214
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

215
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,220
i just feel like everyone

216
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,460
tries to do
somethin' different,

217
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,300
but you always wind up
doin' the same damn thing.

218
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,620
i realized that i
had absolutely no idea

219
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,020
of how i was
gonna get there.

220
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,660
But Etienne--

221
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,580
and i have to hand it
to the guy--

222
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,100
was great.

223
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,900
i mean, he organized
the whole thing:

224
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,540
tickets, timetables,
the whole damn trip--

225
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,460
Bangkok to Surat Thani,

226
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,140
Surat Thani to Na Thon,

227
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,220
Na Thon to Chawang--

228
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,540
500 miles in 24 hours

229
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,740
at less than 400 baht.

230
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,620
Trust me, it's a very good deal.

231
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,620
We were headed
for the great unknown,

232
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,020
but to get there,

233
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,660
we had to follow
the regular tourist trail.

234
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,860
*A little less pushin' *

235
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,740
* Or shovin', take it easy*

236
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,180
*You could even get sleazy*

237
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,100
* Come around *

238
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,940
*Watch a movie *

239
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,420
*With the sound down *

240
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,300
*And get woozy*

241
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,740
We are fine.
it's arranged.

242
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,100
Tomorrow morning.

243
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,140
1 ,800 baht.

244
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,020
Oh, great, man.
Nice work.

245
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,020
There's one problem.

246
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,980
He will not take us
to the island.

247
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,340
it's in
the National Park,

248
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,540
and it's forbidden
to go there.

249
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,420
But we are allowed
to travel to this one

250
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,500
to stay for one night.

251
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,700
Yeah, yeah. No.
See, that's the wrong one.

252
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,060
Yeah, i know that.

253
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,100
Right, but how do we
get from there to there?

254
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,220
We swim.

255
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,860
We swim?

256
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,820
Yeah.

257
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,380
We leave our rucksacks
on this island,

258
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,540
and then we swim.

259
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,420
You can swim,
can'tyou, Richard?

260
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,460
Of course i can swim.

261
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,300
So, no problem.

262
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,860
Okay, so how far
is it, though?

263
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,020
i don't know.
One or 2 kilometers?

264
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,460
Cool. Cool.

265
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,660
Not far at all.

266
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,060
Stop it, Richard.
it will be worth it.

267
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,620
An adventure,

268
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,660
and just the 3 of us!

269
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,060
Uh-oh.

270
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,700
"Can you swim?"

271
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,420
Of course i can swim.

272
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,580
"Oh, yeah, i am french,

273
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,620
and i have zee beautiful
girlfriend, too, eh?"

274
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,180
Great!

275
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,420
God damn it!

276
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,860
Locked out, huh?

277
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,700
Yeah.

278
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,900
Lost your key?

279
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,020
Uh-huh.

280
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,580
Bummer.

281
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,820
Yeah, bummer.

282
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,060
Soyou wanna
grab a beer or somethin'?

283
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,420
You're probably better off
without her, anyway, bro.

284
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,900
Sammy, how the fuck
would you know

285
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,340
if he's better off
without her or not?

286
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,420
You've never even met her!

287
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,220
i'm just tryin'
to help the guy

288
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,500
through the dark times.

289
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,340
it's not a problem.

290
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,580
You see, Zeph?

291
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,780
it's not a problem.

292
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,780
Change the fuckin' subject.

293
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,060
All right. Let's talk about
how you spend an hour

294
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,660
in front of the mirror
every day.

295
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,260
Oh, that's nice.
You know this guy?

296
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,420
He likes to wipe his ass
with tree leaves.

297
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,780
He thinks he's some sort
of jungle commando.

298
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,540
- i swear to God.
- whatever.

299
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,180
Damn. Ha ha ha.

300
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,380
i presume
you know the story

301
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,780
of the Kentucky-fried
mouse.

302
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,900
Yeah.

303
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,940
A woman bites
into a chicken leg,

304
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,900
and it turns out
to be a...

305
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,860
a mouse...

306
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,820
right?

307
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,940
- Right.
- A mouse.

308
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,100
it's an urban myth.

309
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,580
Exactly. it always happened
to a friend of a friend

310
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,340
of someone else.

311
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,340
So?

312
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,780
So, i guess
there's this urban myth

313
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,220
goin' around here
at the moment.

314
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,140
it's about a beach.

315
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,900
Yeah?

316
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,020
Uh-huh.

317
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,140
Huh.

318
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,180
And this beach
is perfect, man.

319
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,260
it's on an island, right?

320
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,220
Hidden from the sea.

321
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,540
Now, imagine, you got...

322
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,780
pure white sand...

323
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,780
crystal-clearwater...

324
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,820
palm trees.

325
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,380
Yeah. With coconuts
and shit.

326
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,820
Yo, tell him
the best part, dawg.

327
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,820
Plus...

328
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,020
enough dope, Richard,

329
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,620
to smoke all day
every day

330
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,820
for the rest of
your goddamn life!

331
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,500
Yeah! Mad weed!

332
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,820
There's only a few people

333
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,420
who know
exactly where it is,

334
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,660
and they keep it
absolutely secret.

335
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,740
Of course, no one's actually
ever met any ofthese people,

336
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,300
only met somebody who has.
You know what i mean?

337
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,700
Exactly. it's
a Kentucky-fried mouse.

338
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,700
hmm.

339
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,940
Although, i must say,

340
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,540
ifi had a key
to a place like that,

341
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,020
i'd keep it to myself,

342
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,020
'cause you don't want
every fucking asshole

343
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,340
in Thailand turnin' up.

344
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,420
Boop-boo!

345
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,540
Yeah, yeah.

346
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,460
So what do you think
about that story, Richard?

347
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,780
it's good.

348
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,380
it's a good story.

349
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,580
- Hey, you!
- Sammy:Jesus.

350
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,140
i got your key!

351
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,380
Richard: Now, i know it wasn't
a part of the plan,

352
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,580
but i made a decision
to leave a copy of the map.

353
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:40,060
i'm not gonna say it was
the best decision i ever made.

354
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,860
i told myself
that spreading news

355
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,740
was a part
of a traveler's nature,

356
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,140
but if i was being
completely honest,

357
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,740
i was just like
everybody else...

358
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,620
shit-scared
of the great unknown...

359
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,980
desperate to take
a little piece of home with me.

360
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,820
Etienne: Richard!

361
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,260
Are you ready?

362
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,380
Yeah, yeah. i'm comin'.

363
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,460
Let's go.

364
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,900
Francoise?

365
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,860
Shht!

366
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,540
Etienne will be angry
if i wake him.

367
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,780
He thinks i waste time

368
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,740
taking photographs
of the sky.

369
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,740
Oh, God.

370
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,060
i think so, too.

371
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,140
Yeah?

372
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,380
Have a look.

373
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,860
One night, i will get
the perfect photograph.

374
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,700
Hi.

375
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,140
Whoa! Ha ha ha!

376
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,980
You realize that...

377
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,180
in the eternity of space...

378
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,060
there's probably a planet
out there, right...

379
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,900
just like this one...

380
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,900
where another you

381
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,020
is photographing
back down towards us.

382
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,580
i mean, essentially,
you are photographing yourself

383
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,900
in a parallel universe.

384
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,540
incredible.

385
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,180
Yeah.

386
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,700
i mean, there are
infinite worlds out there,

387
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,660
you know?

388
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,860
Where anything
you want to happen...

389
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,140
does happen.

390
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,820
Richard,
you know something?

391
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,940
Hmm?

392
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,260
This is just the kind
of pretentious bullshit

393
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,460
that Americans always
say to French girls

394
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,540
so they can sleep
with them.

395
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,260
Oh, God...

396
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,380
sorry.

397
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,300
i thought
i was doin' pretty good.

398
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,980
it's just the sky,
Richard.

399
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,980
Let's try.

400
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,260
Yeah.

401
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,700
idiot.

402
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,140
Un, deux, trois...

403
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,340
quatre.

404
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,500
Richard: When you develop
an infatuation for someone,

405
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,740
you always find
a reason to believe

406
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,500
that this is exactly
the person for you.

407
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,860
it doesn't need
to be a good reason.

408
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,380
Taking photographs of
the night sky, for example.

409
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,140
Now, in the long run,

410
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,580
that's just the kind
of dumb, irritating habit

411
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,460
that would cause you
to split up.

412
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,700
But in the haze of infatuation,

413
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,180
it's just what you've been
searching for all theseyears.

414
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,900
One kilometer.

415
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,340
2.

416
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,540
Richard?

417
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,380
i don't know. i'm American.

418
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,340
So?

419
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,660
i think in miles,
not kilometers.

420
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,860
Okay, so
how many miles

421
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,980
do you think
it is?

422
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:03,540
i don't know, but it
looks like a long way away.

423
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,140
if it's too far,
we're gonna drown.

424
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,980
But if we don't try, then
we'll never know, right?

425
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,700
Right.

426
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,780
So let's go.

427
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,700
Whoo!

428
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,980
You guys all right?

429
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,940
Yeah. We're okay.

430
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,860
Yeah.

431
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,020
i think we're about halfway.

432
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,300
Oh, fuck!

433
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,340
Richard!

434
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,580
Fuck!

435
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,060
What?

436
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,820
i saw a fin.

437
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,700
What? Are you joking?

438
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,740
No, no, no!

439
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,340
A fin.

440
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,820
Okay, a shark fin?

441
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,380
i don't know.
Just a fin

442
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,620
over there,
about 100 meters.

443
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,300
Well, was it big?

444
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,860
Yes.

445
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,700
Well, what the fuck
do you expect me

446
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,020
to do about it?

447
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,580
Nothing. i just thought
you should know!

448
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,780
Well, to be honest, Etienne,

449
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,820
i'd rather
you hadn't told me!

450
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,820
Okay, i'm sorry.

451
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,740
it's a bit fucking
late now, isn't it?

452
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,420
Francoise!

453
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Francoise!

454
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,700
She's gone!

455
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,340
Oh, my God!

456
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,460
Oh, my God!
Okay, what happened?

457
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,580
i don't know.

458
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,140
Shejust
went underwater!

459
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,620
She was pulled under!

460
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,020
Francoise!

461
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,820
Where did you go?
Francoise!

462
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,980
i don't see her!

463
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,700
Oh, fuck! it's her bag!

464
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,020
Okay, was there a shark?

465
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,300
Did you see a shark,
Etienne?

466
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,700
i don't know!

467
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,060
i don't know!

468
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,180
Oh, fuck.

469
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,540
Oh, fuck, man.

470
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,660
Aah!

471
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,580
Aah!

472
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,420
Aah! Oh!

473
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,100
Ha ha ha!

474
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,660
Oh, fuck you! Oh!

475
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,660
Ha ha ha.

476
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,700
Ah ha ha ha ha.

477
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,780
Ah ha ha ha ha.

478
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,940
Oh ho-ho, yeah!

479
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,340
Oh, you Europeans
are so funny, huh?

480
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,380
You have such
a playful sense of humor.

481
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,340
No wonderyour comedies
conquered the world.

482
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,100
Ha ha!
What about Molière?

483
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,300
Who?

484
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,220
Oh, fuck off.

485
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,860
Come on.

486
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,100
Etienne: Wow.

487
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,780
Oh. Now, this is what
i call a lot of dope.

488
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,220
Huh.

489
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,940
Hey.

490
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,420
We're gonna go this way.

491
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,740
Okay? Shut up. Shut up.

492
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,380
Come on.

493
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,500
Aah.

494
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,140
Ay.

495
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,740
Richard: Sure,
we should've turned back,

496
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,100
but i wasn't going to,

497
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,980
not now.

498
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,340
i just kept telling them
we'd get there.

499
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,340
Trust me.

500
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,740
it's paradise.

501
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,340
ifwe take this down,

502
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,260
it should lead us
all the way.

503
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,940
Come on.

504
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,540
Etienne: Fuck.

505
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,820
Richard: Oh, God.

506
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,580
Merde.

507
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,340
Etienne: Well?

508
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,300
Richard: Well, what?

509
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,580
How do we get down?

510
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,980
How do we get down?

511
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,220
How am i supposed to know?
Do i have to decide everything now?

512
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,260
We'll jump.

513
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,060
Fuck. You wanted to be
in command, Richard.

514
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,340
i only took command

515
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,580
because you lost
your nerve, French boy!

516
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,940
Yeah, and look where
you've taken us!

517
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,220
We'll jump.

518
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,820
ifyou're not happy
with the way things are going,

519
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,420
you can just take over.
All right, sir?

520
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,420
All right. i will.

521
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,020
There. We'll
climb down there.

522
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,780
We can jump.

523
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,460
Francoise, look.

524
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,820
We're not gonna jump,
all right?

525
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,340
So just can it.

526
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,940
And as for
climbing down there,

527
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,940
that is just
an asshole suggestion!

528
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,060
You calling me
an asshole?

529
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,220
Yeah, and that's
just the start of it.

530
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,980
All right, fuck-face,
let's do it.

531
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,580
All right, motherfucker.

532
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,820
Etienne: Francoise!

533
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,340
Shit.

534
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,300
Francoise!

535
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,140
Francoise: Come on, guys.
it's okay.

536
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,980
it's not dangerous.

537
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,980
Come on.

538
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,420
Drop the bags down.
Come on!

539
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,140
All right.
So we'll jump.

540
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,820
Oh, fuck.

541
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,220
Both: Aah!

542
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,460
Etienne: Oh, fuck!

543
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,180
Waah!

544
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,180
Wahoo!

545
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,460
Did you see that shit?

546
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,820
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

547
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,700
Richard: Oh, my God!

548
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,340
Congratulations!

549
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,260
Took me the best part
of an hour

550
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,860
to work up the balls
to do that.

551
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,620
Mind you,
i was on me own.

552
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,100
So you have to
make allowances.

553
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,620
You know what i mean?

554
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,580
i think maybe
you better meet up with Sal.

555
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,500
Jesus Christ!
We're fucking here!

556
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,660
Do you realize that?

557
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,980
Don't you go anywhere!

558
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,980
All right.
Doing well.

559
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,140
Ciao, Sonja.

560
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,380
Hi.

561
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,940
Noisy kitchen.

562
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,420
Howyou doing?

563
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,420
What's for dinner?

564
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,780
Man: One guess. Fish.

565
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,460
Richard: i don't know
what we expected,

566
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,860
people living in a cave?

567
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,340
Maybe even
a few guys in tents...

568
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,580
Gregorio.

569
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,940
but nothing like this.

570
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,060
How are you, Keaty?

571
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,340
Roll 'em.
Don't smoke 'em.

572
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,300
it was like we arrived
into a lost world,

573
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,620
a full-scale community
oftravelers,

574
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,620
not just passing through,

575
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,780
but actually living here.

576
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,780
i suddenly became aware

577
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,940
that we weren't
even invited.

578
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,060
Richard:
The guy who drew it--

579
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,180
Daffy.

580
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,220
Yeah. Yeah. He's dead.

581
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,420
Man: What?

582
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,700
Second man: No way.

583
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,620
Yeah. He cut his wrists
open in a hotel room

584
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,180
on the Khao San Road.

585
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,380
You have seen this?

586
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,460
Well, i came afterwards.

587
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,460
Well, that's sad news.

588
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,060
He was one of the founders
of our community.

589
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,940
Oh.

590
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,900
But he became depressed.

591
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,260
Woman:
This is crazy.

592
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,420
The police didn't know
what to do with the body,

593
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,180
so i guess they're gonna,
like, incinerate him

594
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,460
or something.

595
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:42,340
Doyou think he gave
a map to anybody else?

596
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,220
i--i, no.
i don't think so.

597
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,580
And you, have you shown
this map to anybody?

598
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,100
No.

599
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,980
No.

600
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,820
No.

601
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,860
Good.

602
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:02,060
We value our secrecy.

603
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,980
Man: Yeah, burn!

604
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,660
Let's gag one.

605
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,300
* Ooh, me *

606
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,900
You hear that?
You hear that?

607
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:45,660
* i think that i am
going out ofmy mind *

608
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,820
* Going out ofmy*

609
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,980
* Mind *

610
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,900
* Hey, woman *

611
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,540
* it's all right *

612
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,260
* Hey*

613
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,380
* Hey*

614
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,300
C'est magnifiique.

615
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,860
* Hey*

616
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,140
* Hey*

617
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,180
* Hey*

618
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,020
*Woman *

619
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,860
Oh. it's so fucking
beautiful, man.

620
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,340
Neighbors.

621
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,260
Hey. i've got
your oils, man.

622
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,500
Here. i want to
give you something.

623
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,100
Listen up, everybody.

624
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:16,860
Okay. Tomorrow i will travel
for many miles on a bicycle.

625
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,140
Um, Vicki.

626
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:23,660
Uh, uh,
sutra cuputovati

627
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,580
mnogomillja biciklom.

628
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,060
Great. Very good. Helene.

629
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,620
Very good.

630
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:34,940
Sutra cuputovati
mnogomillja biciklom.

631
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,300
Sonja: Very good. Keaty?

632
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,260
All right.
it's far too easy, though.

633
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,700
Yes. Okay. Sutra cuputovati
mnogomillja biciklom.

634
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,980
There's more, you know.

635
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,300
He knows everything.

636
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,100
Richard!

637
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,020
Ahem.

638
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:04,660
Sutra cuputovati
mnogomillja biciklom.

639
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,340
Yes, Richard!

640
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,300
You're represented, man.

641
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,660
Sutra cuputovati
mnogomillja biciklom.

642
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,180
This became ourworld,

643
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:18,140
and these people,
our family.

644
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,580
back home was
just one more place

645
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,620
we didn't think about.

646
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,380
i settled in.

647
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,380
i found my vocation:

648
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:30,020
the pursuit of pleasure.

649
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,340
Sal was the leader,

650
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,940
but it wasn't a big deal.

651
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,540
i mean, there wasn't
any ideology or shit like that.

652
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,500
it was just a beach resort

653
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,180
for people who don't like
beach resorts.

654
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,420
...and some of us build.

655
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,340
Even paradise
takes a little shaping.

656
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,540
Richard: For years,
they kept this place a secret.

657
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,660
They didn't need
to tell anyone.

658
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,780
They were practically
self-sufficient.

659
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,820
The only thing
they had to do

660
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,740
was sail back
once in a while

661
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,780
to trade a little marijuana
and buy some rice.

662
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,020
Whoa!

663
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,900
We grow our own,
which means no stealing

664
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,740
from the farmers
on the other side.

665
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,620
And do they know that
you're living here?

666
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,340
Oh, yeah, but they
keep to their side,

667
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,380
and we don't trespass
on their turf.

668
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,300
A couple of years ago,
they came to us,

669
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,580
and they said
that we could stay.

670
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,380
That was all right, but
nobody else should come.

671
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,500
which kind of
suits us as well.

672
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,860
So, you was lucky,
you know? Very lucky.

673
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,100
Richard: There was Keaty,

674
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,620
who only cared
about 2 things...

675
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,580
Thank you, Lord,

676
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,020
for the twin pillars
of civilization:

677
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:49,620
Christianity and cricket.

678
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,220
There were the Swedes--

679
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,500
Christo, Sten, and Karl.

680
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,460
We like fishing.

681
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,220
Fishing. Yeah.

682
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,020
And in the winter,
we like skiing.

683
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,220
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

684
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,860
Of course, in Thailand,
there is no skiing.

685
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,380
We wait, okay?

686
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,500
We wait until
the fish come.

687
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,380
Get it?

688
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,140
Shit. No way!

689
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,180
Whoo!

690
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:23,620
And i said unto thee,
"i shall provide!"

691
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,980
Yeah!

692
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,940
- Stop it.
- What?

693
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,540
Richard: our resident chef
was known as Unhygenix...

694
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,820
Let's cook.

695
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,260
on account of
his obsession with soap.

696
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,300
Fish, fish, fish.

697
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,980
Still i smell fish.

698
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,060
Richard: There was
a range of sporting

699
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,700
and leisure activities
to suit all tastes.

700
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,500
Etienne is
good at soccer.

701
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,860
i could do that
if i wanted to.

702
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,060
i just
don't want to.

703
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,500
What are you talking about?

704
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,260
Making conversation.

705
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,820
Do you have a girlfriend?

706
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,420
Here?

707
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,180
Anywhere.

708
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,180
No. Why?

709
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:16,060
Just making conversation.

710
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:25,340
Right arm overwicket,
3 balls remaining.

711
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,300
is there anyone who
still does not understand?

712
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,340
The only person
i didn't like

713
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:40,700
was Sal's boyfriend Bugs,
our on-island carpenter.

714
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,620
Hey, Richard.
Can you do this?

715
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,660
Can you make anything?

716
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,820
A man should have
a talent in his hands.

717
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,060
Here we go, people!

718
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,100
Whoo!

719
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,660
So every community
has its rituals.

720
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,140
Well, ours was simple.

721
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,900
The last one to arrive
tattoos the next.

722
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,260
it fucking hurts,
okay?

723
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,540
What did he say?

724
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,740
Aah!

725
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,180
Aah!

726
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,780
Andy,
bring yours closer.

727
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,460
Come on, Richard.

728
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,940
Oh, God!

729
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:28,780
Oh, God!

730
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,460
Oh,Jesus!

731
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,900
That fucking hurt!

732
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,740
All in all,
this really was paradise.

733
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,540
Except for one thing:

734
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:47,980
desire is desire
wherever you go.

735
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,740
The sun will not bleach it,

736
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:52,620
nor the tide wash it away.

737
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,500
Francoise.

738
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,100
One--she's
just teasing you.

739
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,220
What are you
talking about?

740
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,620
2--you don't
speak french.

741
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,180
3--he speaks French.

742
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,180
in fact, even
better than that--

743
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,020
4--he is French.

744
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,980
5--he's much better
at football--

745
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,980
sorry, sorry--

746
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,980
soccer than you.

747
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,140
and 6--you're
a bit strange, rich.

748
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,740
Some girls
like that in a man,

749
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,180
but not usually
the sort of girls

750
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,180
you want to be with.

751
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:55,260
is that right?

752
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,020
Come on. Your last
girlfriend chucked you.

753
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:57,980
There must've
been a reason.

754
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,180
Well,
it was not my fault.

755
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,020
And 7--look at, look
at your thumbs, man.

756
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,300
They're well defined.

757
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,820
What is that
supposed to mean?

758
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,820
You play
a lot of video games.

759
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,580
That is a powerful index
of incompatibility.

760
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,340
Well, why do i
get the feeling

761
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,100
like you're trying to tell
me something here, Keaty?

762
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,260
You haven't a hope,
mate,

763
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,660
not a bleeding chicken's
chance in Thailand.

764
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,060
Know what i mean?

765
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,980
Thank you.

766
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:23,020
So, enjoy the beach
and cut the bullshit.

767
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,340
Thank you very much.

768
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,420
it's my pleasure.

769
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,780
No. no.
You, no.

770
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:30,220
You cannot--no. No! No.

771
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,660
Please leave me.
Leave me!

772
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:32,980
Hey,
that's my bed.

773
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:33,940
No!

774
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:34,900
i can
deal with it.

775
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,260
i don't wantyou
to deal with it!

776
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,740
it won't take
a minute, Gregorio.

777
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,220
No! Really, no.

778
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,140
No. i must
go to mainland!

779
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:44,780
i'm sick.
i've got to. Sal!

780
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,380
What's this?

781
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,380
You want to go to the mainland
to see a dentist?

782
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:49,940
Yes.

783
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,100
it's out of the question.

784
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,060
Come on.
it'll be fun.

785
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,260
i'll be the nurse.

786
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,780
it won't hurt. Be brave.

787
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,220
How's it going,
Richard?

788
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,580
Fine. Fine.

789
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,900
You okay with this?

790
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:05,980
- Yeah.

791
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,980
i mean, we have
a secret here, right?

792
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,540
Sometimes people need
to take a little pain

793
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,020
to keep it that way.

794
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,700
Excellent.
Excellent attitude.

795
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:20,220
No problem.

796
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,380
You'll be okay.

797
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,220
Oh, shit!

798
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:27,500
Good work!

799
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:30,980
Kill the pain, boy.

800
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:32,900
Okay.

801
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,940
Take the drink.

802
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,060
Take a drink.

803
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:42,020
Bugs.

804
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,980
Thankyou, Bugs.

805
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,300
Thankyou.

806
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,580
Richard?

807
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,260
Yeah.

808
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,580
Would you like to come
to the beach with me?

809
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:58,900
Come on, Etienne.

810
00:46:58,980 --> 00:46:59,860
Just throw one, man.

811
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,100
Okay.

812
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,220
Seven ofdiamonds.
All right, man.

813
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,820
Sure. Yeah.

814
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,020
Francoise:
Areyou happy, Richard?

815
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,220
Richard: Happy?

816
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,700
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. i guess.

817
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,900
i mean, the beach,
you know,

818
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,060
is just perfect.

819
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,660
Do you think
that i ignoreyou?

820
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,580
No.

821
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:34,100
But i do.

822
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,660
it's because
i'm with Etienne.

823
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:39,860
it's difficult for me
to spend time with you.

824
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:49,020
i don't suppose that
there's any, you know,

825
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,940
special reason
thatyou should...

826
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,780
spend time with me,
that is.

827
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,500
Of course there is.

828
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,500
i like you a lot.

829
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:01,300
Have you told
this to Etienne or...

830
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,380
No.

831
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,620
it's our secret.

832
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,740
Okay.

833
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,380
Look! There.

834
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,820
The plankton. Shrimps.

835
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,940
When they're disturbed,
they glow.

836
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,260
Come on.

837
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:23,620
That night,
we promised ourselves,

838
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,260
and we honestly believed,

839
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,420
that no one would ever know.

840
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,700
i want to talk.

841
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,100
About what?

842
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,780
Aboutyou and Francoise.

843
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:37,940
What do you mean,
me and Francoise?

844
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:43,180
i mean, Richard...

845
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:46,180
that i want her
to be happy.

846
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:47,860
Yeah.
i mean, of course.

847
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,380
We all do, right?

848
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,540
Shut up!

849
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,620
Please
shut the fuck up.

850
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,860
And if happy
is with you,

851
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,420
then i will not
stand in her way.

852
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,060
Etienne, man, i re...

853
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:09,820
i really don't know
what you're talking about.

854
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,100
Fuck you, Richard!

855
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,300
i know! Okay? i know.

856
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,420
Everybody knows!

857
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:30,220
The problem
is seeing the fish.

858
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,900
With the heavy rain
and the bad light,

859
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:35,580
it's very difficult
to catch them.

860
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,020
it could last for days.

861
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,460
Sometimes...

862
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,740
we get really hungry.

863
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,340
Give me that.

864
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,500
Richard!

865
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:22,580
Richard! Richard!

866
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,900
Richard!

867
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:27,980
i can't hearyou!

868
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,460
You can't hear me.

869
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,380
- Shark!
- Shark!

870
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,140
Shark!

871
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,460
- Shark!
- Shark!

872
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,060
Nnhh!

873
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,220
All right. All right.

874
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,060
All right.

875
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,900
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

876
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,180
Now, before i start,
there's--

877
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,020
there'sjust a couple of things
you have to remember.

878
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,820
Number one,
you have to remain calm.

879
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,420
Right?

880
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:37,300
And number 2,
you have to show no fear.

881
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,340
Teach it. Teach it.

882
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:41,220
Because the sharks--
you see, the sharks,

883
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,700
they can sense that fear...

884
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,620
just as easily as they
can sense blood.

885
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,980
And so it went for me...

886
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:51,420
just as i knew it would,

887
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,380
just as nature
had ordained.

888
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,100
it's...jaw...
wide open.

889
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,780
Row upon row
ofthese razor-sharp teeth,

890
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:03,300
glinting underwater
like jagged diamonds.

891
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,300
its tail fin sweeping
back and forth as it

892
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,580
surged in for the kill.

893
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,100
i swear to God...

894
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:13,100
my whole life

895
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,820
Really. i had nothing
left to offer

896
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,740
except for pure reflex,

897
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:23,860
pure reflex and mankind's
basic drive for survival

898
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,540
that somehow shouts, " No!

899
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:28,300
i will not die today!"

900
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:33,940
And at that instant, man,

901
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,660
i knew it was
either the shark or me.

902
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,900
The shark knew it.

903
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,500
i knew it.

904
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,700
But,jeez, God...

905
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:45,100
it it's nothing personal,
right?

906
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,540
You know, it'sjust
the way the world works.

907
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,500
Right? it's nature.

908
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,380
But if i remember
correctly...

909
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:58,060
in that last glimmer
of its eyes,

910
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:01,820
there was a moment between us...

911
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:07,300
where he said,
" Hey, Richard, man..."

912
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,700
"enjoy your dinner."

913
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:22,940
Uhh!

914
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:23,900
Aah!

915
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:26,140
Strange thing,
killing a shark.

916
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,300
isn't it, Richard?

917
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:31,620
Just a big fish, Bugs.

918
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:33,900
Just a big fish?

919
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,140
Yeah, maybe.

920
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,100
Maybe when it's
just a baby

921
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,900
and it hasn't really learned
to kill yet,

922
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,860
then maybe
it's just a big fish.

923
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:43,740
But when it's
a great white angry mother

924
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:45,820
with a taste ofhuman blood
on its tongue,

925
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,500
now, that's a different story.

926
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,660
Oh, God,jeez...

927
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:00,100
i'm--i'm sorry, bugs.
is it just me,

928
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,900
or does this wet weather
make everyone so damn tired?

929
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:05,020
Jeez, maybe we can hear
your very different,

930
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,620
and i'm sure
very interesting,

931
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,260
story some other time, huh?

932
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,740
Very interesting.
Keaty.

933
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:17,020
Vero interessanto.

934
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:17,980
Tim.

935
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:22,300
Hygie.

936
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,900
Molto interessante.

937
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,940
Good night,
young lovers.

938
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:27,900
Shut up.

939
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:28,860
Good night.

940
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:29,980
For a while,

941
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:33,020
we were untouchable
in our happiness.

942
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,140
All right, everybody.

943
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:40,900
Quiet.

944
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,340
We have a situation.
it's not a disaster,

945
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,820
but as some of you
may have heard,

946
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,180
a couple of sacks
of rice have become

947
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,980
contaminated
by a fungus.

948
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:52,260
That's 'cause we
keep it in that shack.

949
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,780
How many more times does
this have to happen?

950
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:54,940
Rice run.

951
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,780
Which means that someone
will have to come

952
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,940
to Koh Pha Ngan with me
to buy some more rice.

953
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,900
So don't all
volunteer at once.

954
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:14,860
Richard?

955
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,180
Yeah?

956
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,900
Are you gonna come
to Koh Pha Ngan with me?

957
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,340
i don't know.
i mean--

958
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,940
i'll go with you.

959
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:23,940
Don't worry, Bugs.

960
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:25,340
Richard's gonna come,
aren'tyou?

961
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,100
Am i?

962
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,420
Who thinks Richard
should come?

963
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:35,100
All right. Then i'll go
to Koh Pha Ngan with you.

964
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:36,500
Good.

965
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:43,180
i want a toothpaste and--
and a toothbrush, yeah?

966
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:44,260
All right.

967
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,940
Ahem. A new pair
of swim trunks

968
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:47,380
and a new hat.

969
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:50,300
Richard...

970
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:53,060
100 aspirin,
100 paracetamol,

971
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,580
6 packs of tampons...

972
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,940
and 4 double a batteries
and 20 condoms.

973
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,300
Make it 40 condoms.

974
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:00,780
And a bottle
of vodka.

975
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,180
6 bars
of chocolate...

976
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,260
Oh, fuck this.

977
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,700
4 boxes of tampons,
assorted sizes.

978
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:08,420
Smell it.
it's a part of me.

979
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,740
i am becoming a fish,
Richard.

980
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:14,020
Ordinary soap for ordinary
people is a waste of time.

981
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:17,300
i need something toxic,
something industrial. okay?

982
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:18,300
Okay.

983
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:20,460
A tin of beef curry.
Yummy.

984
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,580
Yummy.

985
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:24,300
As many triple-a batteries
as you can find, right?

986
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,820
And a copy of...

987
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,260
the Daily Telegraph.

988
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,860
Just for the cricket,
you know?

989
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,940
Oh.

990
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:34,380
Please fill this bag
with a soft bog roll.

991
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,980
Soft bog roll?

992
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:39,940
Jasmine tea, tiger balm,
lip balm, tea tree oil...

993
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:41,580
a big box of bleach.

994
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:44,220
Hair conditioner,
skin conditioner...

995
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,460
anything based on sugar.

996
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:46,620
12 packs of rizla...

997
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,380
cumin, saffron, cinnamon...

998
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,900
antiperspirant,
and makeup remover.

999
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:59,380
Ahem.
What do you want?

1000
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:03,020
Aah! Oww!

1001
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,980
When you get to Koh Pha Ngan,

1002
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,420
keep your hands to yourself
and your dick in your pants.

1003
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:12,660
Haah, haa haa,
haah...

1004
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,020
Ohh...shit.

1005
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,500
Oh, shit.

1006
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,700
i'd really
been looking forward

1007
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:25,420
to air conditioning
and some cold beer,

1008
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,660
but when we got
to Koh Pha Ngan...

1009
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,900
i just wanted
to leave again.

1010
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:34,220
And in one moment, i understood
more clearly than ever

1011
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,660
why we were so special...

1012
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:38,100
why we kept our secret...

1013
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,860
because if we didn't,

1014
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:43,420
sooner or later,
they'd turn it into this.

1015
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:52,180
Cancers...

1016
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:54,660
parasites...

1017
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:02,420
eating up the whole
fucking world.

1018
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,780
A couple months.

1019
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:14,340
Maybe a year, even.

1020
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,780
Yeah, really.

1021
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,940
No. i like it out here,
you know?

1022
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:23,180
Things are different.

1023
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,780
are different!

1024
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:27,660
Yeah.

1025
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:30,180
No. i'll call again.
i'll call again.

1026
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:31,860
i promise.

1027
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:32,860
Okay.

1028
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,140
All right, i miss you, too.

1029
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,220
All right.

1030
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:37,460
Okay.

1031
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,580
All right, bye.

1032
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:47,700
Bye.

1033
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:51,420
So, how does it feel to be
back in the real world?

1034
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,700
it's not
like i remembered it.

1035
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:54,980
it gets worse
every time.

1036
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:59,740
it is Richard!
Damn!

1037
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:01,820
God! How ya
doing, man?

1038
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:02,780
Good to see ya.

1039
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:05,540
Oh, Sammy,

1040
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,300
Yo, Ricardo.
What's up, bro?

1041
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:08,820
Girls, i want you
to meet the man!

1042
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:10,380
He's the man.

1043
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:11,940
Hil und Eva,
deisem is Richard.

1044
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,980
The man
with the map.

1045
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:15,660
Dermensch mit
den wanderkarte?

1046
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:16,860
Yo, yo, rich.

1047
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,460
They're gonna
come with us, bro.

1048
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:19,420
They're coming
with us.

1049
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,860
Sorry it's been
so long,

1050
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:22,380
but, you know, we're
just chillin' out.

1051
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:23,500
You know how it is,
right?

1052
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:25,540
Listen, guys.
i--i made a mistake.

1053
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:26,500
Mistake?
What mistake?

1054
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:27,460
What are you
talking about?

1055
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,380
No. Listen to me.

1056
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:29,300
There is no beach.

1057
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:31,020
i can't believe
to see you, dude.

1058
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:32,300
There's no beach?

1059
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,260
Yeah. No. Seriously,
the map thing?

1060
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:35,380
it was--it was fake.

1061
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:36,660
it was just like
you said, dude.

1062
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:37,940
- it was a story.
- Right.

1063
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:39,620
No! it's--it's a myth.
Really.

1064
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:40,780
i-it doesn't exist.

1065
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:42,100
- Come on.
- The map,

1066
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,340
- it was a fake.
- Yeah, yeah.

1067
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:44,340
Do you understand
what i'm saying?

1068
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:45,620
You wouldn't be
holding out on us,

1069
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:46,620
would ya?
Let me guess.

1070
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,420
it's a fucking
paradise!

1071
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,380
it doesn't exist.

1072
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:50,460
Oh, man...

1073
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:51,540
what are you
talking about?

1074
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:52,620
i think,
you know, Zeph,

1075
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:53,780
he'sjust tryin'
to fuckwith--

1076
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,100
i'm trying to tell you
to forget it!

1077
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:56,140
All right, asshole!

1078
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:01,780
Well, that's the last time
i buy you a fuckin' beer.

1079
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:07,020
So you told them
where you were going?

1080
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:09,140
Yeah.

1081
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,660
And they saw the map?

1082
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:16,340
Mm-hmm.

1083
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:17,620
Do they have a copy?

1084
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:19,300
No.

1085
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,380
Okay.

1086
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:33,660
Well, we can relax for a bit.

1087
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:37,060
i doubt they have it in them
to get there, anyway.

1088
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:40,580
But, Richard, i don't think we
should tell anybody about this.

1089
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:41,700
Okay?

1090
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:44,100
i think we should keep it
between you and me.

1091
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,340
Thanks.

1092
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:48,460
Don't mention it.

1093
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,260
Whew.

1094
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,180
Well, i'm going
to go and play

1095
01:01:57,260 --> 01:02:00,260
a couple of games of pool
with Sumet.

1096
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:02,980
Sumet? Snook?

1097
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:06,460
So, why don'tyou go
and warm the bed?

1098
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:34,300
Come on.

1099
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:48,860
Sal?

1100
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:52,660
Sal?

1101
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:53,620
Mm-hmm?

1102
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,740
i just have a question.

1103
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:01,460
it was very nice.

1104
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:04,340
No. That's not it.

1105
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,020
it's about Bugs.

1106
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:14,700
Okay.

1107
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:17,140
it's like this.

1108
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:20,940
Bugs is my boyfriend...

1109
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:22,340
my partner.

1110
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:23,340
Okay?

1111
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:27,820
And you are someone
i just had sex with.

1112
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,300
All right?

1113
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:32,140
Oh, th-that's fine.

1114
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:33,900
That's absolutely fine.

1115
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:35,180
Good.

1116
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:36,460
Now get some sleep.

1117
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:39,300
i maywish to have sex again
before we eat breakfast.

1118
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:04,300
it was a deal.

1119
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:07,300
She wouldn't tell anyone
about the map.

1120
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:11,780
i had paid for her silence
and bought my ticket back.

1121
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:15,140
But i didn't even want to
think about the real price.

1122
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,220
All right, Rich,
we're ready to heave!

1123
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:30,620
Okay!

1124
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:36,380
Got it, Keaty?

1125
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:37,500
Yeah!
No probs.

1126
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,060
Problem solved.

1127
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:57,460
All right,
here's your bleach.

1128
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,180
Who got
the makeup remover?

1129
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:01,980
i have 2 of'em.

1130
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:03,220
Extra! Extra!

1131
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:06,780
Oh, Richard, man!
i love you!

1132
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:08,540
One pretty little
pink bag for you.

1133
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:10,060
Oh, great!
Lovely.

1134
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,060
Did you get
batteries?

1135
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,020
Right here.

1136
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,020
Yes!

1137
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,100
* i can see my pretty girl *

1138
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:17,700
Richard:
That's all for you.

1139
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:20,580
Hey, Ricardo!
Grazie.

1140
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:22,140
One tin of beef curry!

1141
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:34,900
One...

1142
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:37,620
disposable camera.

1143
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,300
i know it's not as good
as the one you left behind,

1144
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:40,820
and you'll probably have to
wait a while for the prints,

1145
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,500
but what the hell, right?

1146
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:44,220
No, it doesn't matter.
i like it.

1147
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:48,420
What's wrong?

1148
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:49,900
How was it?

1149
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,260
The rice run? Fine.

1150
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:52,500
No problem.

1151
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:55,580
i mean being with Sal.

1152
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,740
Fine. i mean,
we got along okay.

1153
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:05,460
Some people say
she's attracted toyou.

1154
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,180
Shit. i...

1155
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:09,020
i really wouldn't
have noticed that.

1156
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:10,540
Nothing happened?

1157
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:13,300
No, of course not.

1158
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:15,500
You promise?

1159
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:18,020
Richard:
i was so happy to be back

1160
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,900
that i couldn't bear
to spoil the moment.

1161
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:24,900
Yes. Yes, i promise.

1162
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,980
i missed you.

1163
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:44,460
Okay, come on, everybody!

1164
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:46,700
Come on, please!

1165
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,700
Come on, please.

1166
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:52,020
All together.
Close together.

1167
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:53,500
Please.

1168
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:56,740
Okay, close together.

1169
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:58,940
Okay, stand back there,
please.

1170
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:01,660
Okay.

1171
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:04,900
So 1 ...2...3!

1172
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:10,020
Richard: so i started
just where i'd left off.

1173
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,340
it was almost like
my trip to Koh Pha Ngan

1174
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:14,260
never happened.

1175
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:15,460
Almost.

1176
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:44,660
Shark!

1177
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:15,540
Shut up, you fucker!

1178
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:51,700
My leg.

1179
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:52,660
My leg.

1180
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:05,500
We can take you to
the hospital, all right?

1181
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:06,580
We can do that.

1182
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:08,060
But when you're there,

1183
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:10,020
you mustn't tell anybody
where this happened.

1184
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:12,020
All right? We have
to keep our secret.

1185
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:15,180
What's he saying?

1186
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:17,980
He says that we
are to bring help

1187
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:18,940
here for him.

1188
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:20,820
He won't go
near the water.

1189
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:22,100
Yeah, well,
i understand that,

1190
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:23,700
but we can't
bring anybody here.

1191
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:24,660
We can't do that.

1192
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:26,300
Bring help!
You gotta bring help!

1193
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:27,700
We can't, Christo!

1194
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:29,140
You have to go,

1195
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:31,500
oryou stay here
and take your chances.

1196
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:36,100
Anyone disagree?

1197
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:40,820
What is he
saying?

1198
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:44,860
He wants to know
what happened to his friend.

1199
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:51,100
Keaty: We're gathered
here today

1200
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:55,220
to say our last respect
to Sten.

1201
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:57,660
May God take your soul,

1202
01:09:57,740 --> 01:10:01,340
and you will rest
forever in peace, mate.

1203
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:06,420
We'll miss ya.

1204
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:12,260
Yorgesca de from
Christo and me.

1205
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:17,460
Repost i im pace,

1206
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:19,380
from Lorenzo.

1207
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:42,140
* Old pirates,

1208
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:46,340

1209
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:49,900
* Minutes after

1210
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:52,860

1211
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:57,180
*And my hand

1212
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:00,380

1213

01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:28,780
* Redemption songs *

1220
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:43,500
Richard: After the funeral,

1221
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:45,820
we all tried to get
back to normal...

1222
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:50,460
But it just
didn't seem right.

1223
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:51,940
Pretty soon, it became clear

1224
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:54,460
that the problem
was Christo.

1225
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:55,580
Man: Shut up!

1226
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:59,580
You see,
in a shark attack,

1227
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,620
or any other major tragedy,
i guess,

1228
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:05,340
the important thing
is to get eaten and die--

1229
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:07,100
in which case,
there's a funeral,

1230
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:08,420
and somebody makes a speech,

1231
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,940
and everybody says
what a good guy you were--

1232
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:14,220
or get better,
in which case,

1233
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:15,660
everyone can
forget about it.

1234
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:16,820
i can't take this.

1235
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:18,940
please.

1236
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:29,820
Get better or die.

1237
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:31,460
it's the hanging around
in between

1238
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:33,500
that really
pisses people off.

1239
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:34,460
Listen to me.

1240
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:38,620
You can't do this.
This is disgusting.

1241
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:42,380
Take him back.

1242
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:43,740
Fucking animals.

1243
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:47,780
What are you
doing this for?

1244
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:49,780
Huh? Tell me.

1245
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:52,900
How can you do this?

1246
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,740
Richard?

1247
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:04,100
Fucking bastards!

1248
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:07,620
Bastards.

1249
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,020
it would be
a lot easier

1250
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,420
to condemn our behavior

1251
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,820
if it hadn't been
so effective,

1252
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,820
but out of sight

1253
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:17,300
really was out of mind.

1254
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:21,620
Once he was gone,
we felt a whole lot better.

1255
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:25,460
On the beach, it's easy
to turn your back,

1256
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:28,300
but not always
so easy to forget.

1257
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:09,900
Pay them in dollars,
fuck their daughters,

1258
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:12,260
and turn it into wonderland,
Richard.

1259
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:16,860
Richard, come with me.

1260
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:30,820
Sal: is that
or is that not

1261
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:35,620
a map she's holding?

1262
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:40,380
And did you
or did you not

1263
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:43,060
make that copy?

1264
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:47,460
You know, the lying
doesn't bother me,

1265
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:50,660
but that map
is trouble.

1266
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:52,220
The farmers, right?

1267
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,300
You remember,
those men with guns.

1268
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:56,740
They said to us--
They told us--

1269
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:58,260
no more people.

1270
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:00,660
And now it looks like
we're handing out

1271
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:03,900
fucking tour guides.

1272
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:06,940
Sal, i mean...

1273
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:08,340
we could explain,
right?

1274
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:10,420
i mean, we could tell 'em
it was Daffy.

1275
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,900
"We could explain."

1276
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:19,540
i want you up here
every day

1277
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:20,980
until those people come.

1278
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:22,340
- Here?!
- Yes, here.

1279
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:23,620
And when they come,

1280
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:24,740
i want you
to get the map back.

1281
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:27,420
Okay? Whatever happens,
you get the map back.

1282
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,740
W-w-wait, Sal.

1283
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:30,020
Wait. Sal,
take a look at this.

1284
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:31,620
i mean, they could
be there forweeks.

1285
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,060
That's right, and you'll
be here waiting for them.

1286
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:35,940
W-what am i supposed to do
when they actually get here?

1287
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:37,500
Get the map!

1288
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:39,460
You drew it.
You handed it out.

1289
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:43,980
Now you get it back
and turn them away!

1290
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:46,020
Sal! Sal!

1291
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:51,740
Are you gonna tell
everyone else what i did?

1292
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:02,180
Now, this was truly
a pain in the ass.

1293
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:03,980
i mean, i didn't want
these people to come here

1294
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:05,500
any more than Sal did,

1295
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:08,620
but what exactly
did she expect me to do?

1296
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:10,100
Chase them away?

1297
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:12,180
Threaten them?
i mean, with what?

1298
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:13,620
By the time
these kids got here,

1299
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:15,060
i'd probably
have starved to death.

1300
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:18,580
Sal?

1301
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:19,540
Sal, is that you?

1302
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:20,540
Get that light
out of my--

1303
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:21,780
You're a pig!

1304
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:22,780
Damn it!

1305
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:23,900
What the fuck
was that for?

1306
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:24,980
Look, there's
nothing i could do.

1307
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:26,460
i have to
stay up here!

1308
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,660
Not that, okay?

1309
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:29,660
What is it, then?

1310
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:31,420
You and Sal
in Koh Pha Ngan.

1311
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:35,420
Oh, that.

1312
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:36,900
Yes, that!

1313
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:38,340
She has told everyone,

1314
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:40,460
and me, i'm the last one
to find out!

1315
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:42,860
At least she believes
in honesty, not like you.

1316
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:49,100
i mean, Francoise, i...

1317
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:50,740
Wh-what can i say?

1318
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:53,980
Nothing.
There is nothing you can say.

1319
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:01,420
Thank you.

1320
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:05,780
Thank you for making my life
just perfect!

1321
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:07,300
Super!

1322
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:12,100
God damn it!

1323
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:13,060
Shit!

1324
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:17,700
You are
such an idiot!

1325
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:23,660
even though i knew
it would happen,

1326
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:24,740
i was crushed.

1327
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:27,900
And i guess i deserved it.

1328
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:29,340
i mean, i could have
given her

1329
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:31,180
all the excuses she wanted,

1330
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:34,140
but it still wouldn't have
made any difference.

1331
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:36,580
Great! Great!

1332
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:41,580
At first, i thought
i was gonna die up here,

1333
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:45,300
that my entire world
was gonna end.

1334
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:51,060
But it didn't.

1335
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:03,620
in fact,
pretty soon, i found

1336
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:05,180
that there were
plenty of other things

1337
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:06,460
to keep me occupied,

1338
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,740
and before i knew it,

1339
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:12,700
i found that love--
like grief--

1340
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:14,540
tends to fade away

1341
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:17,620
and be replaced
by something more exciting.

1342
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:24,100
And life up on the hill

1343
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:26,260
turned out to be
a big improvement.

1344
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:28,700
i mean, up here, i could do
whatever i wanted.

1345
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:31,020
There was no fishing duty,
no gardening shit,

1346
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:34,180
no hassle from Bugs
or Etienne or Francoise.

1347
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:37,060
i was playing
my own game now,

1348
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:39,780
and i had absolutely
no reason to go back.

1349
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:28,180
Okay, so i was just
foolin' around...

1350
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:33,340
but the longer i stayed away
from the community,

1351
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:34,700
the less i missed them.

1352
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:47,860
And i found new players,

1353
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:51,060
even if they
didn't know it yet.

1354
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:44,140
this forest
was my territory...

1355
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:50,900
retrieving the map,
my mission...

1356
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:57,620
and these, my defenders.

1357
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:03,580
i was the only one
with the overview

1358
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:08,420
ofhow it all
fitted together:

1359
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:13,060
the island...

1360
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:16,860
me...

1361
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:20,580
them...

1362
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:22,460
the invaders.

1363
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:31,260
All connected,

1364
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:34,860
all playing the same game.

1365
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:40,780
And at the center of it all,

1366
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:41,740
one man.

1367
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:47,180
Daffy.

1368
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:07,500
inside!

1369
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:13,740
Take a look, Richard!

1370
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:15,900
Viruses, Richard!

1371
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:17,300
Cancers!

1372
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:20,460
The big, chunky charlie's
eating up the whole world!

1373
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:22,580
Right there!

1374
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:24,020
Down on the beach!

1375
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,500
Down on the street!

1376
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:29,060
Pay them in dollars
and fuck their daughters!

1377
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:31,780
it starts with 4,
Richard!

1378
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:33,460
4, but they multiply!

1379
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:36,060
They multiply!
it's time to stop them!

1380
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:42,180
Year zero, kiddo!

1381
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:44,940
Year zero!

1382
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:47,140
Areyou with me
or against me?

1383
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:49,340
i'm with you
all the way, Daffy!

1384
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:55,700
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah! Yeah!

1385
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:12,380
Richard?

1386
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:13,980
Yeah.

1387
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:15,260
Where you been, man?

1388
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:20,740
What are you doing
sitting in the dark?

1389
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:22,860
improving
my night vision.

1390
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:25,980
What for, man?

1391
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:29,500
You know who
i think about a lot?

1392
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:31,900
i have no idea.

1393
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:37,140
Daffy.

1394
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:39,900
Daffy?

1395
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:41,260
Uh-huh.

1396
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:47,180
i admire him.

1397
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:50,580
You hardly knew him.

1398
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:52,540
True...

1399
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:57,860
but he had
a certain style.

1400
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:03,340
Come here.

1401
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:04,940
- Now.

1402
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:06,900
Fucking come here!

1403
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,860
Get in there.

1404
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:10,420
They're talking
about you.

1405
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:26,300
He does
no work in the garden.

1406
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:27,380
But he
steals our food.

1407
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:28,420
i'm sure ofit.

1408
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,780
You hear that? You hear
what they're saying?

1409
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:35,020
idle, sponging,
useless prick!

1410
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:37,060
Now get your fucking act
together, Richard, man.

1411
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:38,020
You can't do this.

1412
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:39,140
You can't run around
in the dark

1413
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:40,180
not talkin' to nobody.

1414
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:42,380
What you think
you're playin' at, man?

1415
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:43,700
What's happened toyou?

1416
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:44,940
You was all right.

1417
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,420
Just a couple of weeks ago,
you was fine,

1418
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:49,060
and now
what the fuck is going--

1419
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:50,740
Look at you.

1420
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,700
And you're
talking about Daffy?

1421
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:54,380
Daffy was a nutter,
right?

1422
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:55,540
He went up there,
and he lost it.

1423
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:56,780
He's gone.

1424
01:24:56,860 --> 01:25:01,700
Richard. Richard.

1425
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:03,420
Do you hear
what i'm saying toyou?

1426
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:05,900
Don't lose it like him.

1427
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:07,340
Do you understand
what i'm saying?

1428
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:08,900
Don't go there.
Stay with us.

1429
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:10,580
Co-come back, Rich.

1430
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:11,940
These are good people.

1431
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:13,180
They don't talk about people
all the time.

1432
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:14,780
They're talking about you
because you're fucked up.

1433
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,580
All right?
Don't do this, man.

1434
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:32,060
i got it under control.

1435
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:44,300
And now it looks like we're
handing out fucking tour guides!

1436
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:04,940
Mushroom, Richard?

1437
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:07,620
No, thank you,
Daffy.

1438
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:09,060
i don't need
any help

1439
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:10,820
to see the writing
on the wall.

1440
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:12,620
i'm very glad
to hear that, Richard.

1441
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:13,620
Got to keep
my head clear.

1442
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:14,580
You know what i mean?

1443
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:16,100
Getting closer.
Any day now.

1444
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:17,060
Year zero?

1445
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:19,500
That's the spirit,
kiddo.

1446
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:21,980
You know something?

1447
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:24,900
You led the way,
Daffy.

1448
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:27,180
You showed me
the truth.

1449
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:33,140
But it doesn't matter
what i think anymore.

1450
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:35,100
it's up to you now.

1451
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:37,820
i won't
let you down.

1452
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:39,540
Hey, Richard.

1453
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:41,540
No offense, but, uh--

1454
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:43,500
You're fucked in the head,
right?

1455
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:54,060
it's been real nice
knowing you, Daffy.

1456
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:06,820
We're on patrol
in the delta.

1457
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:08,820
Search and destroy.

1458
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:12,300
We're not making
any contact.

1459
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:21,820
So the lieutenant,
he says to me:

1460
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:24,060
You get out there
and draw their fire!

1461
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:27,140
it's never
gonna happen, sir.

1462
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:29,620
Are you refusing
an order, son?

1463
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:31,500
it certainly
looks that way, sir.

1464
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:36,820
Yeah, it looks
that way, sir!

1465
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:40,660
My M-1 6just went off, man.

1466
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:41,980
it just went off.

1467
01:29:47,740 --> 01:29:50,220
What are we
waiting for? Let's go!

1468
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:54,380
Whoo-hoo!

1469
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:12,260
There's no other
explanation, man!

1470
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:13,700
We're in dope heaven!

1471
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:19,500
* i smoke 2 joints
in the morning *

1472
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:21,660
* i smoke 2 joints
at night *

1473
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:23,540
* i smoke 2 joints
in the afternoon *

1474
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:25,620
*And then
i feel all right *

1475
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:27,900
* i smoke 2 joints
in times of peace *

1476
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:29,340
*And 2 in times ofwar*

1477
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:32,140
* i smoke 2 joints
before i smoke 2 joints *

1478
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:33,340
* and then
i smoke 2 more *

1479
01:30:46,860 --> 01:30:47,740
Hi.

1480
01:30:47,820 --> 01:30:48,820
Oh, shit.

1481
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:51,980
We're Americans.

1482
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:54,780
Tourists.

1483
01:30:54,860 --> 01:30:55,780
American.

1484
01:30:55,820 --> 01:30:57,980
We, uh,
we--we had a map,

1485
01:30:58,060 --> 01:31:00,700
and we--
we came here,

1486
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:01,700
but we made
a mistake.

1487
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:02,660
We made a mistake,

1488
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:04,060
and--and
we're sorry.

1489
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:05,820
We'll go now.

1490
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:13,580
Come on.

1491
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:22,820
Um, we just want--
we just want to go.

1492
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:24,060
Give 'em
something, dude.

1493
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:25,980
Give them some money.

1494
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:27,540
Look!
American dollars!

1495
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:28,620
i've got
American dollars.

1496
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:31,020
You want American money?

1497
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:35,100
Here. You can have them.

1498
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:36,380
Hey, hey, hey.

1499
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:38,300
Um...

1500
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:40,300
i've got--
i've got my watch.

1501
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:41,260
it plays a tune.

1502
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:15,380
This is
our sixth year.

1503
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:17,580
Yeah!

1504
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:22,620
i want
to look ahead...

1505
01:34:24,620 --> 01:34:27,540
because i see that
beyond any problems

1506
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:30,620
that we might have had,
right--

1507
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:35,380
beyond any problems
that we might have--

1508
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:39,060
that we have so much
here to inspire us.

1509
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:44,540
and i'm notjust talking
about the island.

1510
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:48,020
i'm talking about you.

1511
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:51,660
You are what
makes this place work.

1512
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:54,300
And it does.

1513
01:34:57,020 --> 01:35:00,860
i tried to remember
the person i used to be,

1514
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:02,180
but i just couldn't do it...

1515
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:05,020
To the island!

1516
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:06,140
To you!

1517
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:07,980
and so long
as i stayed here...

1518
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:10,900
to the future!

1519
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:12,980
i'd never find him again.

1520
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:30,780
Come with me.

1521
01:35:30,820 --> 01:35:31,860
i've got to
talk to you.

1522
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:33,340
Listen, i've got
to talk to you!

1523
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:34,300
Stop!

1524
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:36,620
Listen to me!
i've got--

1525
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:38,140
i've got to talk
to you! Stop!

1526
01:35:38,220 --> 01:35:40,340
Francoise, listen!
i've got to talk--

1527
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:43,180
Stop!
God damn it! Stop!

1528
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:44,180
Stop it!

1529
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:46,460
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop!

1530
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:48,780
i'm not gonna hurt you!
All right?

1531
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:52,340
it's just me.
it's just me--Richard.

1532
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:53,940
Remember?

1533
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:57,180
The guy who can't
play soccer.

1534
01:35:57,220 --> 01:35:58,980
The guy without
a girlfriend.

1535
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:03,180
Remember?

1536
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:05,620
i've just been away
for a while.

1537
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:11,820
That's all.
That's all.

1538
01:36:20,620 --> 01:36:23,140
Listen. Etienne,
i really fucked up.

1539
01:36:23,220 --> 01:36:25,580
4 people are dead.
i don't know what else they're gonna do,

1540
01:36:25,660 --> 01:36:27,020
but we have
to leave now.

1541
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:28,940
That's it.
Just the 3 of us.

1542
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:30,780
Just like before.

1543
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:31,740
Richard...

1544
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:36,140
i can't leave him.

1545
01:36:36,220 --> 01:36:38,500
Then, we'll
take him with us.

1546
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:39,980
But look at him.

1547
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:41,340
Look at him, Richard.

1548
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:44,580
We can't move him.
it's gangrene.

1549
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:47,500
it's spreading.

1550
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:49,020
He's gonna die.

1551
01:36:59,220 --> 01:37:01,140
Wait for me
at the boat.

1552
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:46,460
Christo had suffered

1553
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:48,700
because we wouldn't
let anything spoil our fun.

1554
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:53,540
in the perfect
beach resort,

1555
01:37:53,620 --> 01:37:55,860
nothing is allowed
to interrupt

1556
01:37:55,940 --> 01:37:57,500
the pursuit ofpleasure.

1557
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:00,740
Not even dying.

1558
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:13,940
Do you think
i want to hurt you?

1559
01:39:14,020 --> 01:39:18,620
i'm a farmer.
That's all. Understand?

1560
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:20,860
i work.

1561
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:24,300
i send the money
to my family.

1562
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:30,980
if too many people
come to this island,

1563
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:32,740
it's trouble for me.

1564
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:36,100
i can't work,

1565
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:37,900
i can't send the money,

1566
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:40,660
and my family don't eat.

1567
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:46,340
i said no more people,

1568
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:48,500
but more people come.

1569
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:52,660
And you.

1570
01:39:54,380 --> 01:39:56,780
You give them the map!

1571
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:04,700
Now, you all go home.

1572
01:40:04,780 --> 01:40:08,540
Forget this island.
Forget about Thailand.

1573
01:40:08,620 --> 01:40:10,660
Understand? Huh?

1574
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:11,620
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1575
01:40:11,660 --> 01:40:13,860
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1576
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:15,820
No.

1577
01:40:15,860 --> 01:40:17,180
What?

1578
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:19,140
No.

1579
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:22,500
We're not leaving.

1580
01:40:22,580 --> 01:40:25,860
This is
our home, too.

1581
01:40:25,900 --> 01:40:27,740
This is our house.

1582
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:29,900
We built it
with our own hands,

1583
01:40:29,980 --> 01:40:31,620
and we are not
leaving.

1584
01:40:33,380 --> 01:40:35,500
Oh, Sal. Sal.

1585
01:40:35,580 --> 01:40:36,740
i think--
i thinkyou're making

1586
01:40:36,820 --> 01:40:39,820
a big mistake here.
Really.

1587
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:42,940
if he says
that we should leave--

1588
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:44,580
Richard, shut up!

1589
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:49,060
This is all
your fault, anyway.

1590
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:53,540
You copied the map,
Richard.

1591
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:10,980
You are a clever boy.
The one who sneak around.

1592
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:12,140
You steal from us,

1593
01:41:12,220 --> 01:41:13,420
Let him go! Ugh!

1594
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:14,500
play with guns,

1595
01:41:14,580 --> 01:41:18,940
and you bring
people here.

1596
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:43,780
if you want to stay.

1597
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:52,820
if you want to stay.

1598
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:10,660
Sal. Sal.

1599
01:42:14,180 --> 01:42:15,180
Fuck. Sal, no!

1600
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:16,940
Sal. Listen.

1601
01:42:16,980 --> 01:42:18,500
Don't be crazy, okay?

1602
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:19,500
You can't!

1603
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:21,580
Don't be crazy, Sal.
Put the gun down.

1604
01:42:21,660 --> 01:42:23,220
You let us down,
Richard.

1605
01:42:23,300 --> 01:42:24,380
You brought us
trouble.

1606
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:27,300
You can't, Sal.

1607
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:29,340
Make her stop!
Make her stop!

1608
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:33,180
You need to help!

1609
01:42:33,260 --> 01:42:34,900
You need to help me!

1610
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:42,660
You fucking bastards!

1611
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:47,460
Come on, Sal.
Please, Sal.

1612
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:52,420
You can't do it.
You can't do it, Sal.

1613
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:53,540
Fuck!

1614
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:55,180
'Cause if you
pull that trigger, Sal--

1615
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:56,260
if you pull
that trigger,

1616
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:58,220
it's all fucking over,
and you know it.

1617
01:42:58,300 --> 01:42:59,340
Come on.

1618
01:42:59,420 --> 01:43:01,300
'Cause this time...

1619
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:02,500
This time,
it's not like Christo

1620
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:04,580
rotting out in the woods
where no one could see.

1621
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:05,900
it's not like
the 4 people

1622
01:43:05,980 --> 01:43:07,900
that i saw killed today.

1623
01:43:07,980 --> 01:43:12,700
This time, everyone
has to watch, Sal.

1624
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:15,340
Everyone has to see
what it takes

1625
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:18,060
to keep our little
paradise a secret.

1626
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:20,500
Come on, everyone,
watch!

1627
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:21,460
Shut up.

1628
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:22,700
Everyone watch Sal
do this.

1629
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:24,140
Yeah, go on, Sal, do it.

1630
01:43:24,180 --> 01:43:25,260
- Come on.
- Do it.

1631
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:26,300
Come on, do it, yeah.

1632
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:29,060
Let 'em see the blood
this time, huh? Huh?

1633
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:30,300
Let's see
if they can take it.

1634
01:43:30,380 --> 01:43:31,460
God!

1635
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:37,540
They can take it.

1636
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:14,500
No! No! No! No!

1637
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:17,220
No! No! No!

1638
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:22,660
Come on.
Hold on to me.

1639
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:39,180
Game over,

1640
01:44:39,260 --> 01:44:43,180
but she was never
gonna leave.

1641
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:46,340
She believed in it all
way too much to ever change,

1642
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:49,340
so that's exactly
where we left her.

1643
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:57,100
*We sailed
over 7 seas *

1644
01:44:57,140 --> 01:45:01,020
* Searchin' for
that missin' key*

1645
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:04,820
* Unlockin' you *

1646
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:07,140
*The world's harmony*

1647
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:16,180
* i climbed the highest
mountain range *

1648
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:18,940
*And then we took
the longest... *

1649
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:21,140
And as for the rest ofus...

1650
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:23,540
we carried away our sins
and made ourway back

1651
01:45:23,620 --> 01:45:26,660
to wherever it was
that we called home...

1652
01:45:26,740 --> 01:45:29,580
to pick up the pieces
of what ever was waiting.

1653
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:41,180
Of course, you can never
forget what you've done.

1654
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:43,580
But we adapt.

1655
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:45,220
We carry on.

1656
01:45:49,580 --> 01:45:54,060
* i hear the rhythm
in the river's run *

1657
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:59,260
*And blinding, fainting
desert sun *

1658
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:02,060
* Hear them today*

1659
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:04,540
*They all are strong *

1660
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:13,180
*And distant forces
in the far-off sky *

1661
01:46:13,260 --> 01:46:18,340
* Led us to that
elusive place *

1662
01:46:18,380 --> 01:46:21,180
*To the new sound *

1663
01:46:21,260 --> 01:46:23,420
* i will testify*

1664
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:26,180
Can i getyou
anything?

1665
01:46:26,220 --> 01:46:27,140
No, thanks.

1666
01:46:27,180 --> 01:46:28,260
* Na na-na na... *

1667
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:29,660
And me?

1668
01:46:29,740 --> 01:46:32,940
i still believe
in paradise.

1669
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:35,860
But now at least i know it's
not some place you can look for.

1670
01:46:38,300 --> 01:46:40,460
Because it's not
whereyou go.

1671
01:46:40,540 --> 01:46:42,580
it's how you feel
for a moment in your life

1672
01:46:42,660 --> 01:46:44,300
when you're a part
of something.

1673
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:50,700
And if you find
that moment...

1674
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:57,300
it lasts forever.

1675
01:47:58,380 --> 01:48:00,900
* God knows, you lonely souls *

1676
01:48:03,340 --> 01:48:06,020

1677
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:22,020
