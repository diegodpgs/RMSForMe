1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,400
Calm

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,120
Your feel more and more calm...

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,280
Now imagine a screen...

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,920
A movie screen that opens before you

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,240
Create on it any place you like

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,040
Concentrate on your breathing

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,520
Helping your body to relax
...feel at peace

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,600
You don't have to change it.
Just let it come and go

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,120
Come and go...

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,640
Now...

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,120
You are there

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,840
Pay attention to the details

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,520
The colours

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,400
The textures

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,480
The light

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,240
The temperature. Feel the temperature

17
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,720
Allow this calm view to develop before you

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,200
The feeling of peace is infinite...

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,600
It's raining cats and dogs

20
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,320
Are you sure this is closed

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,800
Are you more calm now?

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,640
Well, is not easy.
With that view I have in front

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,840
What view?

24
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,360
I can see through your skirt

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,080
You are such a pig!
You know what, I won't read you anymore.

26
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,200
Besides, is almost time.
I'm going to pick her up

27
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,280
Ok, I’ll stand up and prepare some coffee

28
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,960
Would you like some music?

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,520
Ok, whatever is on

30
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,160
Ok, I’ll leave you with your Wagner

31
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,400
See you in a while

32
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,640
THE SEA INSIDE

33
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,080
Julia, get in the car.
You're going to freeze

34
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,720
You are Gené, right. I am Mark, hello

35
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,320
And Julia?

36
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,880
It looks like Galicia doesn't like us

37
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,160
Yeah, well, it's February.

38
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,640
How was your flight?

39
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,440
Fine. We finally meet

40
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,920
Would you mind coming with me in the car?

41
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,040
We had agreed that only one
person would come

42
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,080
Yes, of course

43
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,760
- And..?
- Oh, Mark? He's only here to take notes

44
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,920
- Ok. Do you trust him?
- Yes. Well...he works at the firm

45
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,880
Look, I’m not sure if you are aware
of the step that Ramon has to take

46
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,200
Of course I know the step Ramon has to take.
We've talked about it

47
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,000
Today it's you, then it’s the press, then it's the television.

48
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,280
Ramon is afraid that this could be taken
in the wrong direction

49
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,920
All I can tell you is that I’ve
come to do things as best as possible

50
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,240
I hope so...

51
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,560
And I remind you that for me this is really important

52
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,040
Not only professionally...

53
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,480
Believe me
I understand Ramon very well

54
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,120
- Hello
- Hello

55
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,080
My name is Julia

56
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,600
You are the lawyer

57
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,240
This is Manuela. Ramon's sister in law

58
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,760
- Do you want help?
- No, no. It's fine

59
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,960
They're here

60
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,560
- Hello
- Hello

61
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,160
Excuse me for not giving you my hand

62
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,200
How come?

63
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,200
They tell me you are a little nervous

64
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,400
- Well, let's see. The first thing is breakfast
- What time?

65
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,520
9:30. Don't think that I like to wake up early

66
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,440
- After that, I listen to the radio for bit
- What do you like to listen to?

67
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,760
- A little of everything. Mostly debates.
- You like debates?

68
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,960
Yes, yes. I like the party

69
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,440
See. This is my personal computer

70
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,720
- Did you design it?
- Yes, I like inventions.

71
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,160
My father or my nephew builds them

72
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,760
You are so serious all of a sudden

73
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,840
Why dying?

74
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:14,880
Well, let's see. I want to die because
for me, life in this way...is not worthy

75
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:24,880
I can understand if other tetraplegic could
feel offended when I say life like this is not worthy

76
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,160
But I don't judge anyone.

77
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,920
Who am I to judge those that want to live?

78
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,120
That's why I ask not to be judged nor the
person that helps me to die

79
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,880
And do you think someone is going to help you?

80
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,200
Well, that would depend on the ones taking the decision.
If they manage to conquer their fears

81
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,880
It's not such a big deal. Death
has always been there and always will be

82
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,520
In the end we all get there. All of us.
It is a part of us

83
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,640
Why are they so surprised
because I say I want to die?

84
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,200
As if it is contagious

85
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,320
If we finally go to trial, they will ask you
why you don't seek alternatives to your disability

86
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,360
Why do you reject the wheel chair?

87
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:27,200
To accept the wheelchair would be like
accepting breadcrumbs of what used to be my freedom

88
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,680
Look, you are sitting there, less than 2 meters away

89
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
What are 2 meters?

90
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,880
An insignificant trip for any human being

91
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:51,120
Well, for me, those 2 meters, necessary to get to you
and being able to touch you, is an impossible journey...

92
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,640
...a chimera, a dream

93
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,120
That's why I want to die

94
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,320
The three hours have passed, Ramon

95
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,360
She has to change my posture

96
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,560
Would you mind waiting downstairs?

97
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:14,400
He called us a year ago.
He wanted us to, literally, help him die

98
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:23,880
I told him that we could provide psychological help,
legal support. But we wouldn't put the cyanide in his mouth

99
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,160
He got very mad. He called us liars.
I had to hang the phone

100
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,240
A few days later he called again, more calm.
I was surprised at how decided he was

101
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,320
- He has ever hesitated?
- Never

102
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,400
That is very important

103
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,360
- And how long has he been like this?
- 26 years

104
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,200
His mother used to take care of him but
when she died, his sister in law took over

105
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,320
How do you feel?

106
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,000
Fine, this arm...a little higher

107
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,440
I'm going to change the catheter

108
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,080
- Not now Manuela
- It's just a moment. Let them wait

109
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,960
She is married to Jose, Ramon's brother

110
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,000
They live of the farm and a little orchard they have

111
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,240
And what do they think about this?

112
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,760
Ideas are free.

113
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,600
But I think that is not right

114
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,760
But why not?

115
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,240
I want what's best for him.
Everyone in this house wants that

116
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,680
Then why would he want to die?

117
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,840
I cannot get that into my head

118
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,360
It's not rational, as he says

119
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,360
I cannot give it to him and I don't give my
authorization to do it in this house

120
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,280
Hello

121
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,040
- Don't leave that there Javi!
- Oh come on mom!

122
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,720
Take it to your room

123
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,040
Your uncle wants you to check the machine

124
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,960
- The bag...
- Yes!

125
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,320
- What's wrong?
- The roller is a little stuck

126
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,960
- Didn't you have exam today?
- No. And the lawyer

127
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,160
She is with Gené and grandpa.
He took them to the beach

128
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,240
They might end up in Corunna.
With that head of him

129
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,160
Don't talk like that about your grandfather

130
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,880
His mind is completely gone

131
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,680
Of course, he is old, what do you want?

132
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,880
Well, that he stays out of the way

133
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,600
He is all day at home...

134
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,840
As if we needed him.

135
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,400
What

136
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,440
Look, one day...I don't know when,
maybe in a long time...

137
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:19,080
One day you are going to regret so much, so much what you just said.
That you will want the ground to swallow you

138
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,480
- But why?
- One day, you'll see. One day...

139
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:34,680
Here the ocean is very treacherous.
Those who dare bathe in it, have to be very careful

140
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,920
My son jumped from here.

141
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,200
I don't know what he was thinking.

142
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:52,480
He jumped exactly when the water was receding
and he hit his neck against the sand

143
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:00,400
This is very very sad.

144
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,080
God wants him to keep on living.

145
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,200
But you know that he doesn't want to live anymore

146
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,640
But, he never told me anything,
he never told me...he never told me anything

147
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,280
Look, we will win Heaven, because
we have spent our whole lives in Hell

148
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:29,720
I tape this image so the judges or politicians
or whoever has to decide

149
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,360
understand better...

150
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:41,040
Apparently they can't identify with the psychological pain of the person,
then maybe this way they'll understand that this is not life

151
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,600
Why do you smile so much Ramon?

152
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,040
When you can't escape and depend
constantly on others

153
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,520
You learn to cry by laughing

154
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,360
Good morning

155
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,400
- Does Ramon Sampedro lives here?
- Yes, what do you want?

156
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,520
I was taking a ride and thought
about visiting him

157
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,080
I heard lots of people come to see him

158
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,080
Ok

159
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,000
Just a little while

160
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,680
My name is Rosa

161
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,480
Come closer

162
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,680
Where are you from?

163
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,440
Boiro. I came on my bike

164
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,720
Oh God, I feel like such a fool

165
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,160
- Why?
- Well, because I don't know what to say. Since I don't know you

166
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:40,360
Don't worry about that. I can't do anything else.
Please, have a seat.

167
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,640
Why did you come?

168
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,080
You're not making it easy.
What do you do?

169
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,120
I work in a conserve factory

170
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,600
and I’m also a radio host at Radio Boiro,
Wednesdays and Fridays

171
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,480
- So, maybe I’ve heard you sometime
- Yes?

172
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,600
- But is only an amateur thing... - No,
you are pretty good - Yes, apparently, eh?

173
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,640
The thing is to get started, after
that no one can stop me

174
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,160
- I have 2 little sons
- Your husband?

175
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,560
- No, well, I had one but we broke up.
- Don't you mind being alone?

176
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,000
Let's see. I had a boyfriend, the
father of my youngest son...

177
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,080
but he left me...we broke up too.
So now I’m alone but happy.

178
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,800
I was asking in case I had any chance...

179
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,520
Why do you laugh?

180
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,600
Sorry...

181
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,960
It's ok, I was joking

182
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,640
Besides, I don't think I’d be willing to take on
two children; I have enough with my nephew

183
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,040
I saw you on TV the other day

184
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,880
Hmmm...see, now we are getting closer

185
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,960
Closer to what?

186
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,960
To the reason why you came

187
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,960
I heard what you said and then I saw your
eyes, that are really pretty

188
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:18,680
Thanks

189
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:24,080
And I thought, those eyes full of life!
Why would someone with those eyes want to die

190
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,400
Look, we all have problems sometimes and
we don't have to run away of them, you know?

191
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:35,800
- No, I don't run away of my problems...
- Yes, of course you do. That's why I wanted to come

192
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,520
What for?

193
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,760
To give you reasons to live

194
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,880
- To tell you that life...
- Life what?

195
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,040
It's worth it

196
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:02,120
Let's see, did you came here to
see me or to convince me?

197
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,440
No, I came because I want to
be your friend Ramon

198
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,800
If you want to be my friend, Rosa,
you should start by respecting my will

199
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,240
How can you be so closed?

200
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,160
Don't judge me. Don't judge me Rosa.
Not in my own house

201
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,640
Or do you want me to judge you?

202
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,400
Do you want me to judge you?
Why don't we talk about the real reason you came

203
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,320
Why don't we talk about the fact that you are
clearly a frustrated woman...

204
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,200
that woke up this Saturday looking for
ways of giving reason to your own life

205
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,400
Yes, run. You that can.

206
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,800
Thanks a lot.
So you don't want me to put you anything?

207
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,240
- No, dear. Just stay as cheerful. Good night
- Good night

208
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,320
Well, it's 8:45 and here we are at Radio Boiro.

209
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,240
I remind you that you can call
and request your favourite song

210
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:11,320
Before I continue...I would like to dedicate the
next song to someone that maybe is listening tonight

211
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,320
I know he listens to the radio a lot

212
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,040
I would love it for him to call me someday
and ask for a song

213
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,720
Although I know he won't because...the last time
we saw each other we didn't end up in good terms

214
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,280
But for what it's worth,
I’d like to tell him I'm sorry

215
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,320
I'm sorry I judged you Ramon, I am
such a fool and I can't help it

216
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,920
Enough...for you my friend, Ramon,
"Negra Sombra" (Black Shadow)

217
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
- Yes?
- Hello

218
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,160
Gené! How are you?

219
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,560
Well, still at the office.
You are giving us too much work, Ramon

220
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,280
I'm just kidding

221
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,040
Hey, the report was spectacular.
We have received a lot of support calls

222
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,480
- This will be really great for the trial
- If you say so...

223
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,840
Oh, come on! You have to improve that mood,
otherwise we won't be able to do anything

224
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,640
- You knew we had to do this.
- Yes, I know, I know

225
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,000
Julia, the lawyer, wants to see you again
and this time for longer

226
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,520
Has she fallen in love with me?

227
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,600
You wish handsome!
besides, she is married

228
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,800
No, she says she needs to know you
better to prepare the case

229
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,120
That's what they all say

230
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,840
Wait...
2 minutes and I’m there

231
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,720
Hey, did you know that the guy that came
with her wants to go out with me

232
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,120
- Are you leaving me for a lawyer?
- No

233
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,240
You are missing on it

234
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,720
I see it quite well

235
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,200
Your leg

236
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,080
Well, yes.. it moves

237
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:38,400
Let's see...this is going to be easy.
You only need to answer with your heart

238
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,080
With the head, you mean..

239
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,480
With the head.
You don't mind if I record it, right?

240
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,080
Let's begin with your youth, before your accident.

241
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,760
What did you do then?

242
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,480
Is that necessary?
I had forgot all about it.

243
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,480
Is your memory that bad?

244
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,560
No. I just thought we would talk about
my suicide demand

245
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,480
We will Ramon. It's just that is very important
that the judge identifies with you

246
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,480
and that he understands you.

247
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,000
For that I need to know who is
Ramon Sampedro and who he was

248
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,960
That way, you will use it against me later.

249
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,880
You are such a Galician!

250
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,120
- I'm your lawyer; I’m on your side
- Ok

251
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:39,160
When I was 19, I packed my things and
I went around the world

252
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,080
I was doing that for a couple of years,
until the accident

253
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,280
Wait, wait. You went around the world with
only 20 years?

254
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,120
You just don't know how.
Ship mechanic.

255
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,880
I always tell my nephew.
To travel without money, become a sailor.

256
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,080
What?

257
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,680
Looking for proof?

258
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,280
No, is that I can't see a single picture
of you around here

259
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,800
How were you in your younger years?

260
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,440
Why? Am I so ugly now, or what?

261
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,960
Ok, I won't ask you anything else. That's it

262
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,800
You don't like looking into the past, right?

263
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,200
Of course not, I look into the future.

264
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,640
- And what is the future for you?
- Death, just like for you

265
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,120
Don't you think about death?
I'm not the only one who thinks about it.

266
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
Yes, yes. Of course I think about it

267
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,920
I just try that it doesn't become
my only thought

268
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,440
Tomorrow is going to rain

269
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,560
Tomorrow is going to rain

270
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,840
I think he whistled

271
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,520
- I didn't hear a thing
- Yes, he did

272
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,760
- What do you want?
- The game already started

273
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,800
But you know I don't like soccer

274
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,760
Why don't you watch it downstairs?

275
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,120
Hey, if you want to convince me
you need to give me a rational justification

276
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,560
The "Depor" is playing

277
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,960
That is not a rational justification

278
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,960
- But it is important
- Why?

279
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,080
Because it is decisive for the league.
If they loose this one, they can only make it to second place

280
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,840
OK, turn it on

281
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,640
- Can you see?
- Yes

282
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,600
Did you hear him whistle too?

283
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,480
Ramon told me you asked about the pictures

284
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,240
Yes

285
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,040
There's gotta be one somewhere

286
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,680
I'll look for them tomorrow

287
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,160
Thanks

288
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,880
If you need more blankets, look in the closet

289
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,680
In June, it is still cold at night

290
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,080
Manuela...

291
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,000
- No, no, no
- Yes, yes, yes

292
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,080
I cannot accept this, I can't

293
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,600
Manuela, I’m going to stay a couple of days.
The least I can do is contribute with something

294
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,760
But added to the fact that you are
doing it for free

295
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,160
I'm doing this because I want to.
Manuela, please...

296
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,800
Ok. Anything that you need, please let me know

297
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,040
Thanks

298
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,680
What are you plotting over there?

299
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,160
Nothing

300
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
It's a shame you can't see the sea from here

301
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,200
It's better like that

302
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,400
That way I can see it when I want to

303
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,320
How come?

304
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:54,560
When I want to, I concentrate and
take a step to the sea

305
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,000
Flying

306
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,560
I imagine that the sea means a lot to you

307
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,400
Well, the sea gave me life and
then took it away

308
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,000
I don't know if that means anything

309
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,720
Give me some details about that day.
The day that your life changed, ok?

310
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,640
Whatever you say.

311
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,160
Ok, first...

312
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,480
...when did it happen?

313
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,280
August 23rd of '68

314
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:31,000
- You still lived with your parents?
- Yes. I was still a kid

315
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,920
- Were you alone at the beach that day?
- No, I was with some friends, town's folk

316
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:47,520
But how is it that someone so familiar with the sea
didn't calculate the receding

317
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,960
I was distracted

318
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,120
Distracted?

319
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,720
Yes, I was thinking about things

320
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
And?

321
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,120
Ok. Leave it alone. It doesn't matter

322
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,960
I can see you don't want to
talk about it either

323
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,920
No. I'm just remembering

324
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:56,520
When I realized I was in the air,
jumping on an almost empty pool

325
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,760
- Were you left unconscious?
- No. I was just there...face down

326
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,680
Floating

327
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,280
You know is true what they say about those
that are about to die

328
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,400
that all of a sudden you get to see the
most important moments of your life

329
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,280
That happened to me

330
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,440
And what did you see?

331
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,960
They say that those that drown, after all the
air has been expelled, die instantly

332
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,400
A sweet death.
I should have died then

333
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,160
- Do you still see all this people?
- Some I do, some I don't

334
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,520
- Who is this girl?
- Some girl

335
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,200
Well, she appears in many pictures

336
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,160
She lived in the town.
Can I have a puff?

337
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,000
- Do you smoke?
- From time to time in case it kills me

338
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,760
but nothing...

339
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,360
- She was my girlfriend
- Your girlfriend? And what happened to her?

340
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:48,440
There was a time when she used to go to the hospital.
One day she said something foolish about getting married

341
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:56,840
And I told her to get out of there, try to resume her
life the best way she could and that she should forget about me

342
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,040
But, did you love her?

343
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,080
That was not the issue

344
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,600
How come?

345
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,200
The issue was if I wanted to love her in this condition

346
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,040
Are you telling me you refuse to love because...

347
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,280
Because I can't love

348
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,240
Just like that

349
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:32,160
So, what I have to tell the judge is that, in your opinion,
tetraplegics have no right to fall in love

350
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:38,880
But who's talking about tetraplegics?
I'm talking about me, Ramon Sampedro

351
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,640
There are other ways of making love

352
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,080
Yes of course

353
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,120
Has any girl kissed you in the past 27 years?

354
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,440
Now you are going to show me how, no?

355
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,240
- The girl from Boiro is here
- The girl from Boiro?

356
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,080
- Christian, I told you to come here
- Rosa!

357
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,120
- Hi Ramon
- I told you to come here!

358
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,040
Leave him, it's ok.
Are you good or bad?

359
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,360
- Bad.
- Then we will get along fine

360
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,880
- I'm Julia
- I'm Rosa, nice to meet you

361
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,800
I'm sorry to have interrupted you

362
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,000
I'll go for a while and leave you alone

363
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,320
- How are you?
- Fine

364
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,400
I hope you are not here to give me some of
those reasons to live you always bring

365
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,840
No. No way.
Well, I don't know...

366
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,280
I wanted to see you.
And wanted you to meet my sons

367
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,440
That's better

368
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,800
Christian, behave yourself.
We are not at home.

369
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,880
This is Samuel.
Sami, say hello

370
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,440
Hi, Sami.

371
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,920
- Why are you in bed?
- Because he can't move, I already explained it to you

372
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,400
Is it true you can't feel a thing?

373
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,520
What happens to you now?
Are you hot?

374
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,560
It's just that with this weather you never know.

375
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:41,440
We are on strike because there's been a month
since they paid us. So it's like Sunday for us

376
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,240
I made the breakfast, we took the bus
and we came to see you

377
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,640
- What happened?
- Nothing

378
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,040
Samuel, why are you crying now?

379
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,320
Manuela...

380
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,280
What do you think about all this?
Tell me the truth

381
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,800
What do I think about what?

382
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,200
That your brother in law wants to die

383
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,120
That’s what he wants

384
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,840
Ok, but...

385
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,040
...but you. What would you want?
What would you prefer?

386
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,800
What I prefer has no importance

387
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,560
Ramon wants to die.
Everything is quite clear for me

388
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,720
- Would you like to see a thing?
- A thing?

389
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,040
Yes, come

390
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,840
- Christian, leave that alone
- Leave me alone!

391
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,600
I'm going to leave your ass like
a ripe tomato

392
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,480
Almost all of them are poems

393
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,040
I never threw anything away

394
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,320
I couldn't do it.
It takes a lot of effort for him to write them

395
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,320
And his handwriting...
Look...

396
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,120
I never saw such a beautiful handwriting

397
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,120
- Ok. I'll be downstairs
- Manuela

398
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,360
It's going to take me a while to read all of this

399
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,720
- Would you mind telling Ramon that...
- That you went to the beach

400
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,800
- ...to take a walk
- Thanks

401
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,840
Of course it is the first and the
last time I bring you here

402
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,760
- But mom, that guy is faking it
- The last time!

403
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,480
- Did she tell you when would she be back?
- Just to take a walk

404
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,840
That way you can take a nap

405
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,680
- You can't complain
- Why?

406
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,720
Not a minute passes by that a woman
comes into this house. Are you building a harem?

407
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,560
Manuela, you know I’m only married to one

408
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,400
Yes, with Death

409
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,240
- Do you want anything else?
- No

410
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:26,160
They told me you were here.
And I came flying

411
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,400
Manuela...

412
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,360
Hi

413
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,800
How was the walk?

414
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,800
I've been reading Ramon

415
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,480
I've been reading all that you have done.

416
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,240
You know what?

417
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,240
What you have written...

418
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,720
...is wonderful

419
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,240
So...you are not only a lawyer,
but also a writer

420
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,600
Ok. Make fun of me.

421
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,480
But I tell you that this can be published

422
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,080
Of course it can be published.
Nowadays you can publish almost anything

423
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,120
I don't see a better way to support your demand

424
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,000
It's your voice

425
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,840
Look Julia, this was more clear
at the beginning

426
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:42,240
You came here with a purpose, to help me

427
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:48,920
Instead of that, you start questioning everything.
Looking for reasons...

428
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,480
You get inside my feelings...

429
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,480
Do you want me to leave?

430
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,600
What I want right now is a cigarette, please

431
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,320
Sure.

432
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,360
I'll go get them

433
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,160
Julia, what happened?

434
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,120
Are you alright?

435
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Manuela!

436
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,960
It's not about what happened,
but about what could happen.

437
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,360
Because...one day...is the legs

438
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:57,320
But on another day...

439
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,080
...you can go blind

440
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,880
And you can get better or not

441
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,160
I had been lucky so far

442
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,160
but then comes the next stroke

443
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,760
and the next, and the next

444
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,000
and no one can tell you when
or how they are going to be

445
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,400
No one can tell what is going
to be left of you if anything at all

446
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,640
Your husband is very optimistic

447
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,960
And what is it good for?
If there's not even medication for this

448
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:44,400
What's the point of standing up, working, getting your
hopes up if at the end comes the next stroke and you fall again

449
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,320
and you feel again like shit

450
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,040
It's ridiculous

451
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,560
I called you because I want
to become a member of DMD

452
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,560
I had thought about it 2 years
ago when I was diagnosed

453
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,280
but I backed out at the last moment

454
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,360
But not after this...

455
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,040
...not after this.

456
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,880
I can't take it anymore.
This isn't life

457
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,480
Does your husband know?

458
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,280
- I don't know if I want to tell him
- You should

459
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,280
Fear is a very powerful weapon.

460
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,040
Fear doesn't give you freedom to decide

461
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,480
What you are telling me right now
is a product of that fear

462
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,000
Maybe, later, you will back out,
precisely out of fear

463
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,600
Do not act based on fear.

464
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,720
You are supposed to support people
that want to commit suicide, right?

465
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,840
No.

466
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:06,520
Do you think that I go around telling people with problems
that the best is to get out of the way

467
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:14,360
No. What we support is freedom.
The freedom of those that want to live and those that want to die

468
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,720
It's very different

469
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,840
And CADASIL is a very fucked up disease, I agree

470
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,520
But I only ask that you think it a little bit more

471
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,880
Ramon, gave me this for you

472
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,320
If you want, we can talk some other day about this

473
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,240
How do you see her?

474
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,040
Fine

475
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,520
Really?
I also think she is fine

476
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:11,200
- Ok. Nice to meet you
- Thanks for coming

477
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,400
You are welcome

478
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,120
- I'll stay a while longer
- OK

479
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,280
Dear Julia...When Gené told me that a lawyer wanted my case

480
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,360
there was something that
influenced my decision

481
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,360
and it was the fact that the lawyer
suffered a degenerative disease

482
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,000
I thought that only someone in that
condition could really understand mine

483
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,600
And shared my hell

484
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:54,920
Now I know that living in that hell is sometimes
worth it, if one gets to meet people like you

485
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,120
It's worth it to have shared
a cigarette with them

486
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:05,520
or, like right now, caressing them even if its just
by writing some foolishness like this

487
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,400
And talking about foolishness,
I'm correcting my writings

488
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,280
With the hope that you will come soon
and give me a hand

489
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,160
For now, my nephew Javi is helping me
by copying them on his computer

490
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,560
For the rest, life continues just the same, you know

491
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,880
Manuela kept the whole month covering me
so next year doesn't catch me off guard

492
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:29,160
Javi keeps fighting with his grandpa and sometimes
I make up little chores so they spend more time together

493
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,680
This month some friends came to visit.
Some of them have been doing it for 25 years

494
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,040
and that keeps surprising me

495
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,400
They enjoy telling me their stories

496
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,760
Do you remember Rosa?
The girl from the conserve factory.

497
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,000
I think she found here some kind of refuge

498
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,240
The other day she wanted to help Manuela to
change my clothes, and they ended up arguing

499
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:54,280
I proved again that when you depend on someone
for everything, you lose your privacy

500
00:51:54,600 --> 00:52:01,000
Well...I hope to keep my little kingdom in order
until you can cheer me up with your presence

501
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,280
A big hug.

502
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,400
What's going on?

503
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,960
Let's see. What does it say here?

504
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,920
"No es asi la vida que va" (The life that goes is not like that)

505
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:22,920
No sir. It has to say
"No es así la vida. Qué va" (Life is not like that. No way)

506
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,960
- No
- Yes. And that "Qué" has accent

507
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,200
That "Qué" has accent. Do you see it?
Right there.

508
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,400
"Death is my friend,"
where's the colon?

509
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,760
What are they teaching you in school?

510
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,400
You have to pay attention to what I give you

511
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,120
Even your grandpa would do it better

512
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,640
Look Javi, if this is the way you are going to help
I rather you didn't do it, ok?

513
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,600
Because you make me work twice

514
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,160
Give me the stick.
Give me the stick

515
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,760
Put a little more attention, ok?

516
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,280
- Javi, what happened?
- Nothing

517
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,040
Dear Ramon...please forgive me for taking so
long in answering your letter

518
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:38,280
But the doctors have limited me the use of the computer
and in general, any activity that doesn't make me use my legs

519
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:43,000
They assure me that I’ll be able to walk again
but they say that I shouldn't continue with your case

520
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,440
In the physical therapy room there's a huge window

521
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,760
Sometimes I imagine that I go through it and fly,
like you, over Barcelona

522
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,320
I reach the sea and keep flying until I can only
see that endless line of water

523
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:04,640
And think, foolish me, that if you do the same
from Corunna, maybe you'll go around the world again

524
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,160
And we end up finding each other in
some part of the planet

525
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,640
I identify with you when you mention
the lack of freedom and privacy

526
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:18,560
I try to bear with it, mainly for my husband
that takes care of me with much dedication

527
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,240
But at the same time, I refuse to fall
into this inertia

528
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:27,040
where I just can be grateful for what is given because
I have no other choice but to accept it

529
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,120
I wish I’ll be able to see you in a couple of months

530
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,400
And I keep my promise of helping you
with the book

531
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:36,320
Until then receive the thanks and
a hug from a very good friend

532
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:44,840
I knew this could happen, I knew it.
We are going to have to try again

533
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:48,000
No Mark, how can you say
that we have to try again?

534
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,400
As if justice is so swift in
this country

535
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,840
No. And now it is me the one
that has to tell him

536
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:32,360
The demand of the tetraplegic Ramon Sampedro requesting the euthanasia
was rejected yesterday by the tribunals due to defects in its form

537
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,240
The sentence says that the judicial process
should have been started in Corunna

538
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,800
where he resides, and not in Barcelona

539
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:46,480
Many voices have been raised due to this case
among them is priest's Francisco de Galdar

540
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,000
tetraplegic like Ramon

541
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,960
Ramon says he doesn't want to
live anymore, but I wonder

542
00:55:52,720 --> 00:56:00,360
isn't it possible that Ramon is asking of society,
of all of us, some kind of attention

543
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,040
What is he talking about?

544
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:08,160
Maybe is that the people that surround him doesn't
provide the love or support that he needs

545
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:09,840
That moron

546
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,960
Couldn’t it be possible that what Ramon is
asking is for more love?

547
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:21,920
I would really like to talk to him and convince him
that there are many reasons to keep on living

548
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,440
Aren't you going to school?

549
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,600
I hope you are happy now!

550
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,440
Our whole family humiliated
on television

551
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,640
But keep it up, keep it up.
Until our faces fall out of embarrassment

552
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,760
And you dad? Aren't you going to tell him anything?

553
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,560
Don't involve dad in this.
Whatever you have to tell me, do it and be done with it

554
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,480
I'm going to tell you something Ramon.
I am the older brother

555
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,560
Listen to me, listen to me for a moment

556
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,760
What if you have an accident tomorrow
and you die?

557
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,320
Have you thought about it?

558
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:16,920
What would happen to me?
I would have to take care of the family, right?

559
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:22,000
Of your wife, your son, dad...
With that miserable pension of mine

560
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:26,800
If I stay alive, I’ll make
things a lot more difficult

561
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:32,280
I'm going to tell you something Ramon.
I am the older brother

562
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:37,200
I am the older here. And while I’m alive,
no one is getting killed here

563
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,760
No one in this house is getting killed.
Put that in your head, Ramon

564
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,120
No one!

565
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:13,160
- Ok, son. I'll leave
- See you tomorrow dad

566
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,800
I'll go

567
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,640
Hi Manuela, I came to see Ramon

568
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,680
But, do you know what time it is?

569
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,880
I know. I couldn't come sooner.
I'll explain it to Ramon

570
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,080
I don't think he's in the mood of visits.
He had a bad day

571
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,600
Why don't you come tomorrow?
Or the day after?

572
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:51,840
It's important

573
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,800
The conserve factory is closing

574
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,400
That things are not going well.
That there's no money to pay us

575
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,400
And that we are fired

576
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,640
There's no right, damn it!

577
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,720
There's no right.

578
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,080
- Forgive me Ramon
- I have nothing to forgive

579
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:16,200
Cry all you want.
I wish I could stand up and give you a hug

580
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,160
Now that I had started to save some money

581
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,200
I wanted to buy you a telescope
for the day of the Wise Men

582
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,240
You don't have to buy me anything, Rosa

583
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,640
I will get really mad if you spend one cent on me

584
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,200
But I really wanted to

585
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,680
- I wanted to give you something
- But why do you have to give me anything?

586
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,120
Because you gave me a lot Ramon,
you have no idea.

587
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,080
No man has ever been so kind to me
as you have been

588
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,360
Was it that bad?

589
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,160
Now, I don't complicate things

590
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:09,200
Now I know that the problem must be me, right

591
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,040
That men doesn't like me or something

592
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,200
What do you say, Rosa?
How is that even possible?

593
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:21,520
Wasn't that what you told me when I came
here the first time?

594
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,920
Frustrated woman, you said

595
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:31,240
Yes, yes. If I called you that then,
now I call you strong and brave

596
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:36,640
and kind and beautiful. And I call an imbecile
to those who can't see it

597
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,840
Rosa, please stop it.

598
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,760
You make me feel like a priest and
I hate them enough already

599
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,160
Sit over here, come on sit.

600
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,360
And leave my hand alone, you know I can't feel it

601
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,920
My son says you are faking it.

602
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,280
But you do feel your face, right?

603
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:33,320
I wish I could help you.
I would do anything to help you.

604
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,600
You would help me?

605
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,080
Yes

606
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,800
Don't worry. I have it all planned
so that no one ends up in jail

607
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,320
I have some friends that are willing to help

608
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:52,000
I only need one more.
Someone brave, like you

609
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:55,760
No.

610
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,840
Help you heal...

611
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,760
not die

612
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:20,000
Come un guys, let's go.

613
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,360
Are you holding him?

614
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,640
He won't fit through here

615
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,960
Ramon says that he understands the situation
but that he won't come down

616
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,800
Ok. It doesn't matter.
Brother Andres

617
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,280
Go upstairs and tell Ramon

618
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:19,280
...and since we are inside eternity.
Life doesn't belong to us...

619
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:25,200
and we take to ridiculous extremes the
bourgeois definition of private property

620
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:28,480
You are killing me

621
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:32,760
But if Church was the first one in
secularize the private property

622
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,400
- I can't tell him that
- How come?

623
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:37,800
Should I tell him that?

624
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:48,960
Freedom to choose my beliefs...no, his beliefs
and decide over his life

625
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,080
Ok, now you tell him

626
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:58,280
Why does the Church keep with such passion
that posture of terror of death?

627
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,600
Because it knows that it would lose
a great amount of its customers

628
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,040
if people lose their fear to the
Great Beyond

629
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:11,120
He reminds you that according to the polls,
67% of the Spanish are in favour of euthanasia

630
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:15,400
Very well, very well. Now you tell him
that moral issues are not resolved through polls

631
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:20,320
Because most of the German people was
also in favour of Hitler

632
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,920
Now he is going to compare me to Hitler.
That is very rude

633
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,400
No, not that

634
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,160
Ask him what does Hitler has to do with anything

635
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:35,600
No wait...
Padre Francisco, do you hear me?

636
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,120
Yes. Ramon I can hear you

637
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,680
Why do you mix pears with apples?

638
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:45,160
I hope you didn't come here to do demagoguery.

639
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,560
Because you Jesuits know a lot about that.

640
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,600
No, no. Of course not.

641
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,520
But since you bring up demagoguery, my dear Ramon.

642
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:59,800
Don't you think that what's really demagogic is
to say "Death with dignity"

643
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:04,320
Why don't you leave the euphemisms aside and
call things by its name, with all its rawness

644
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,000
"I take my life" and that's it...

645
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:12,920
It keeps surprising me your interest in my life,
when the Institution that you represent

646
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:20,280
accepts the death penalty and condemned for centuries
to the bonfire those who didn't think in the right way

647
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,760
Now it is you the one doing demagoguery

648
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:27,600
Yes of course, but leaving the euphemisms aside, as you say
that's what you would have done with me, right?

649
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,440
Burn me alive

650
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,120
Burn me for defending my freedom

651
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,240
Ramon, my friend...

652
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:35,440
Friend?

653
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,880
Ramon, my friend. A freedom that
eliminates life is not freedom

654
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,720
And a life that eliminates freedom is not life either

655
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,920
Don't call me friend!
And leave me alone

656
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,040
Come on. Let's go

657
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:03,120
You...you that look like kind people,
give this man reasons to live

658
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:10,200
Prove to him that life is not only
moving your arms and running around

659
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:15,160
or kicking a ball.
Damn it! Life is something else, really

660
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:19,600
Life is so much more.
Hear it from me.

661
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,360
And what do you want us to do?

662
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,680
That we gag him so he doesn't talk?

663
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,080
Or that we put him to sleep with a
rattle like a little kid

664
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:38,560
Look. you appeared on TV and
something that I can't take out of my head

665
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,200
Manuela, leave it alone

666
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,880
You said that Ramon's family didn't
give him enough love...

667
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:48,440
you should know that in this house no one
stopped loving Ramon for one single day

668
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:49,720
Not one day

669
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:56,840
I've been looking after him for many years
and I love him like a son

670
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,120
I don't know which one of you is right

671
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:08,520
And I don't know if it's true what you say
about life belonging to God and not to us

672
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,480
but I do know one thing

673
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,880
you have a very big mouth

674
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:39,480
Rosa, I told you that is not
necessary. I already shaved Ramon

675
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:41,680
Yes, yes. But I know a better way

676
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:46,920
Where do you have the soap?

677
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:50,800
They're here

678
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,760
I don't feel anything.
Are you sure there's a child in there?

679
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,480
7 months old, darling

680
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,920
- Well, he's not moving
- You're the one that doesn't move

681
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:14,800
- Now, now, now
- See

682
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:19,000
- He's happy to see you
- How are you going to call him?

683
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,120
We still don't know

684
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:26,560
Well, call him Ramon and that way one day
when he asks why, you can tell him my story

685
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:28,880
It's better for you to tell him

686
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,520
There's someone else who will
be really happy to see you

687
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:46,520
- No, no. Not like that
- Grandpa, shut up

688
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:00,240
- How come you didn't say anything?
- We wanted to surprise you

689
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:03,280
This a great Wise Men's day present

690
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,680
I'm going to open the windows,
it's really hot in here

691
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,200
We better get out and
leave you alone for a while

692
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,880
How are you sailor?

693
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,240
- Do you drink coffee Mark?
- Yes, please

694
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:30,280
- How are you Rosa?
- Fine

695
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,800
Ramon told me that you had found a new job

696
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,480
Yes, caring for some elderly people

697
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,640
Does that woman is going to stay long?

698
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,840
A couple of weeks, depending on how
long the book takes

699
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:49,320
Well, I guess I won't be able to shave him.
See you some other time

700
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,680
Bye Rosa

701
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:55,040
Ok, the judges have their hands
tied because of the legislation

702
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,600
We are going to try to
obtain a statement

703
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:02,680
where we recommend to the government
changes to the penal code

704
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,880
- The government?
- The government is there to serve us, Javi

705
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:07,360
Your uncle is more important

706
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:11,160
The jury will not dare agree with us,
we already know that

707
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,480
But we cannot fail on the
regional audience

708
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,280
Javier, help me with the cows

709
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:33,040
We have to convince the judges that
Ramon is complete sane and lucid

710
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:36,600
It would help us a lot
if he would make a declaration

711
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:40,640
Manuela, we have to take Ramon
out of the house

712
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,520
Can you tell me what were
you doing in there?

713
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:48,880
Do you know what are they talking about?
What they want?

714
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,200
And what do I do?
Lock myself up in the room?

715
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,000
Do you understand what they really want?

716
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,480
What happens if he wins the trial?

717
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:04,480
Your uncle gets injected and dies, like a dog.
And you never see him again

718
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,200
You will never see him again, Javier

719
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,920
Or do you think death is so great?

720
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:12,000
Please use your head

721
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,360
Death is a very serious thing, you hear me?

722
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,920
- Your uncle dies and you won't see him again.
- Leave me alone

723
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,360
It's not that he doesn't feel like it, he
just doesn't want to use the chair

724
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,520
Taking him out of the house once or twice
a year is an accomplishment

725
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,840
Well, this one has to be one of those times.
It is very important that Ramon takes this trip.

726
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,200
And when would that be?

727
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,320
I estimate that the trial will take place in the spring

728
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:47,800
So we still have time to propose it to him.

729
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:52,560
There's only one thing worse than the death of a son

730
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:55,720
and that is he wanting to die

731
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,160
Well, let's get to work

732
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:21,360
"...get inside of you, eternally,
my seducer lover, beloved sea"

733
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,320
Can you really smell the sea from here?

734
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,120
Yes, and sometimes in the morning if there's wind

735
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:34,360
and the window is open,
I can smell it as if I was there

736
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,000
You have a very good nose

737
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:41,720
Smells are probably what cause me
more intense sensations

738
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,000
More fantasies

739
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,440
...your smell, for example.

740
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,480
My smell

741
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:01,920
Yes, is the first thing I imagine when
I day dream about you

742
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,520
Really?

743
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:10,400
- And what are those dreams about?
- Just things

744
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,200
They all have one thing in common...

745
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,760
In all of them I can move...

746
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:28,080
and I stand up and travel wherever
I imagine you are at that moment

747
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:32,880
And if I imagine that you are here, for example

748
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,720
I just get close to you

749
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:42,800
And do what I have been
wishing to do so many times

750
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:48,400
Then your smell becomes
stronger and I get dizzy

751
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:55,880
I can feel your heart beat
then I feel your hands

752
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:02,640
And then I lose my mind...
I lose my mind

753
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:36,320
Is the water ok?

754
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:59,520
Julia...

755
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,480
Julia, are you awake?

756
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:06,920
Yes

757
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,320
I can't sleep

758
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,400
Why is that

759
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:19,280
I have an itching in one leg,
can you come and scratch it?

760
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:21,280
...the leg

761
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,440
I brought him some "filloas"

762
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:47,120
- I know he likes them - Rosa,
please listen -I made them

763
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:52,280
I've told you that you don't have to cook him
anything, or bathe him or shave him. Nothing

764
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,000
I take care of Ramon.
Get it?

765
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:59,920
- Ok, then I want to hear it from him
- No, he already told me

766
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:03,320
Besides, he is very busy now.

767
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,640
Is he with her?

768
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:17,280
I wish I was a lawyer too.
But of course...

769
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:29,920
- Don't cry Rosa, don't cry
- If you don't want to see me, please tell me

770
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,440
- Of course I want to see you
- It doesn't look that way

771
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:35,120
Really, what are you...

772
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,600
Rosa...
Rosa...

773
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,320
She hung up

774
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:49,040
Do you mind dialling the number again
and giving me a minute alone

775
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:04,080
What's going on between you two, Ramon?

776
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:09,640
But Julia...

777
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:13,880
Why would I need to explain anything to you?

778
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:19,160
I don't understand why you answer me like that,
because then I don't know what I’m doing here.

779
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:25,200
Unless of course, you think that there's
nothing happening here

780
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,640
The kiss you gave me yesterday meant nothing?

781
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,440
Look at you

782
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:36,240
Look at you sitting there

783
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,600
Look at you

784
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:42,800
And now look at me

785
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,120
Where are we going Julia?

786
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,520
Look at us

787
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,520
I haven't finished

788
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,200
What do you think?

789
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:00,240
That I don't think about what happened to me?

790
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:04,240
Of course, I think about it. Frequently.

791
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,960
Every single day. It's like a nightmare.

792
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:15,800
And I know that it will only get worse and worse
until I end up like a vegetable

793
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:20,040
So I have reached a conclusion and I rather...

794
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,640
I'm going to do it Ramon.

795
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,080
I'm going to take my own life

796
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:51,720
But before I do it, if you want to, my love...

797
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,960
I would like to help you.

798
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,600
Leave together...

799
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,760
You don't say anything?
You didn't expect this.

800
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:18,920
When?

801
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:25,960
I don't know. We are almost done
with the book and...

802
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:36,200
I'll go to Barcelona and look for an editor
so you can publish it.

803
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:44,960
And then I’ll come back with the first copy.
That same day, Ramon. That same day.

804
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:50,560
Listen to me, in the worst case scenario
we would win the public support.

805
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,240
If the verdict is negative the
discussion will be more heated

806
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:57,680
- Don't be stupid...I can't
understand... - Are you ok? - Yes, Yes

807
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,560
News, what news?

808
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:07,160
Mark, please be careful. It's ok, it's ok.
What happened Ramon?

809
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:08,600
We are here.

810
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:16,120
I understand Ramon, I understand.
But that doesn't matter

811
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:23,800
Listen to me, if no one takes this step. If everyone hides their
heads and doesn't even try to confront the state, the judges...

812
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:41,840
And what do we do now Manuela?
I mean, with the trip to Corunna.

813
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:44,160
Do I go there and waste my time?

814
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,480
Knowing that they won't listen to me.

815
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:58,520
Well, I think that today it is a waste of time but
maybe tomorrow it could be useful for someone else

816
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,440
Ok. Let's go and see those judges in the face

817
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,760
- Javi, where is the chair
- The chair?

818
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:22,480
I don't know, it's probably in the back.

819
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:28,480
Well, I want you to take it out and clean it up. Then bring
grandpa and I’ll explain. We are going to make some changes

820
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:32,160
Are going to put a motor?

821
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:36,200
- You have to cut here and here
- Let the back move, right?

822
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:44,720
You have to cut these pipes down here and then join them
with bolts so they move as hinges. Are you getting this?

823
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:47,640
- Yes, yes
- And you dad?

824
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:52,240
Your going to be lying down son.
You might fall sleep at the trial

825
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:55,200
It's not as if they're saying
anything interesting, dad.

826
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,560
Die to Live

827
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,080
LETTERS FROM HELL

828
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,760
You should put a pillow here
to support my head

829
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:24,680
In case I fall backwards and break my neck

830
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:30,440
Hey, Javi. Do you get it? Break
my neck... Break my neck...

831
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,120
Grandpa

832
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:50,160
Look, if you're going to help me like that,
is better if you do nothing

833
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,400
- Am I tying you too tight?
- You're asking me?

834
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:23,280
Wait a moment please.
Ramon

835
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,120
Manuela, please.
As if I don't look ridiculous enough

836
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,160
Better this than catching a cold

837
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,960
And don't you dare, taking it off

838
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:41,200
You are Ramon Sampedro, right?

839
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,360
I really wished it was me the
one to take you.

840
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:51,680
Living is a right,
not an obligation!

841
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:56,800
- Look at all the people here
- Who did we kill, eh?

842
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:02,200
Ramon, do you feel alone because you
are the only Spanish to have requested euthanasia?

843
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:09,240
Yes, well, the first one in requesting it in a public manner.
But this has been happening for many years.

844
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,560
What do you expect from the judges?
What are you going to tell them?

845
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:18,200
I just want to tell them that
I’m completely sane and lucid

846
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:21,400
Silence

847
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:28,120
Can we talk later?

848
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,000
Silence, please

849
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:36,080
In a state declared as lay and that recognizes
the right to the private property

850
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:41,200
and which constitution expresses also the right
not to suffer tortures or degrading treatments

851
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:45,960
is correct to say, that whomever sees his position as
degrading, as in Ramon Sampedro's case,

852
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,080
should be able to decide over his own life

853
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:54,480
in fact, no one that attempts suicide
and survives is judged afterwards

854
01:26:55,640 --> 01:27:00,360
but...
when you need the help of someone else

855
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:04,920
to die with dignity, then the state interferes with
the freedom of the people and tells them

856
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:08,040
that the life they are living is not theirs,
that they can't make decisions about it

857
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:12,320
This, Your Honour, can only be done based on
metaphysical beliefs, or religious

858
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:16,280
In a state, I repeat...

859
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,400
that is declared lay

860
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:25,320
Your Honour, I ask for a legal answer,
but above all, rational

861
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:27,640
and human

862
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:36,040
And now, with your permission,
Ramon Sampedro would like to read something

863
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,040
Overruled

864
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:43,480
My client wants to address you directly so you
hear from his own voice...

865
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:46,360
You know perfectly well the process

866
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:49,480
Of course I know it, I know it perfectly

867
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:54,680
But I didn't know that it was so irrelevant
for you to give three minutes of your time

868
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:55,560
Three...

869
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,040
To listen to a man that has been waiting
for 28 years

870
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,360
If you want to change the process...

871
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,000
change the laws

872
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,960
Yes, of course.
I know that already.

873
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:09,080
This case is ready for a sentence.

874
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:25,960
Well...I knew you were not going
to take it seriously.

875
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:31,400
That's what all men do. Laugh at me.
You were not going to be different

876
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:36,080
Rosa, forgive me. It's just that lately
a little of everything happened to me

877
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,400
- And...I’m a little overwhelmed.
- Why?

878
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:42,560
Am I not allowed to fall in love
with a tetraplegic or what?

879
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:43,920
Is it that weird?

880
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:51,760
Well, maybe we should clear up some things.
Especially if we are talking about something as complex as love.

881
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,760
- Complex?
- Yes Rosa, complex.

882
01:28:54,280 --> 01:29:00,960
No matter how much you tell me that you love me,
I will never be sure of how real is your love

883
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:06,760
or if it's just an idealization of a man you wanted
to find but couldn't or didn't last.

884
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:10,640
But what are you talking about Ramon?
Don't try to confuse me

885
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:15,240
Either you love or you don't.
You can't rationalize love

886
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:22,680
Well, if that's the case, what do you want me to do?
You want me to move in with you?

887
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,800
For me is enough to know that
I can visit you from time to time

888
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:28,640
Of course you can.
Of course you can

889
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,200
Yes, but for how long?

890
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:37,080
Rosa. You wouldn't ask me
to stay alive for you, right?

891
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,200
What if I told you that...

892
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:46,640
that you give me strength to live Ramon

893
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,880
Wait wait. Stop this thing for a moment

894
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,200
Sit over there.

895
01:29:56,240 --> 01:30:01,120
- Let's see. Do you love your children?
- Of course I do.

896
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:04,160
Well, there you have the strength to live

897
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,360
Don't give me that responsibility Rosa

898
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:12,000
Is that what you call love?
Keep me here against my will?

899
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,040
Look...

900
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:19,800
The person that really loves me is
the one that will help me die.

901
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,480
That is love, Rosa

902
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:33,200
Dear Julia...yesterday I received the sentence
of the provincial audience

903
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:40,000
the judges understand that I want to die, but
remind me that to help me, would be punishable by law

904
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,440
In other times, this would have affected me a lot

905
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:48,360
Pushing me into that alley without exit where
days and nights never end

906
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:54,120
But now I feel that everything is rushing by
and that the publication of the book will happen any day now

907
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:58,760
And with it you will return Julia.
My Juliet...

908
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:02,560
It will be the sweetest death that I could ever imagine

909
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:05,000
It will be love, pure and shared

910
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:09,920
And it will be the return to balance.
Finally to balance

911
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,200
A kiss, my dear friend

912
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:10,760
Ok, see you later

913
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:22,120
Should I open it?

914
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:27,800
It's the book!

915
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:32,720
Look, is the book.
You are on the cover

916
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,120
It smells great

917
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:48,960
It's for you

918
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,280
I'm going to show it to mom

919
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:32,880
Why...why...
why can't I be happy with this life?

920
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:35,000
I'm going to give you a tranquilizer

921
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:38,680
Why do I want to die?
Why do I want to die?

922
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:51,000
Give me two more Manuela.

923
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:54,040
Manuela, for crying out loud, two more
pills are not going to kill me

924
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:55,320
Give me two more

925
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,280
You'll feel better soon

926
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:49,360
- How do you feel?
- Fine

927
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:51,960
What time is it?

928
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:54,960
11:00 am. I didn't want to wake you up today

929
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,680
The girl from Boiro has called three times already

930
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:02,200
What did she want?

931
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:05,720
She says she has to talk to you about
something important

932
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:11,240
- For her it is always important
- Dial the number for me please

933
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:15,080
Are you going to call her?
Why don't you wait for her to call back?

934
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:19,360
But she can barely pay her phone bill.
Dial the number please

935
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:25,200
Of course Ramon.
You always so kind

936
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:34,200
- Ramon?
- What's going on, Rosa?

937
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,440
I need to see you. I have to talk to you

938
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:41,840
- You said I should call you before visiting you
- Yes. Did something happen?

939
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:44,480
Can I come now?

940
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:51,520
Look Ramon, you said you had a plan or something

941
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:57,720
That you had figured out a way of doing what you want to do,
if the judges decided against you

942
01:35:57,880 --> 01:35:59,880
Yes, Rosa, but I already asked you to
forgive me, right?

943
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:01,400
I told you to forget about it

944
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:03,080
Yes.
But I can't

945
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:04,560
I can't, you know

946
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:11,800
Because last month the audience said no.
And you are still thinking about doing it

947
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,200
Is that what worries you?
That I get my way?

948
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:19,320
- So, are you going to do it?
- It's not that easy, Rosa. But don't worry

949
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:21,960
You will be the last person to find out.

950
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:31,120
Ramon...

951
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:39,280
It's that I realized...
I understood what you said in Corunna.

952
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:43,720
"The person that really loves me will
be the one to help me"

953
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:46,800
I'm completely sure about what I feel Ramon

954
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:49,720
I love you

955
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:55,600
Do you want me to help you?

956
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:00,000
Rosa...

957
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:06,560
I'm not joking Ramon.
Do you want me to help you?

958
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:14,520
But what are you going to tell him?
Jose wait...

959
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,720
Did you hear me!
I will not allow this

960
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:23,960
And what are you going to do?
Strap me to the bed?

961
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:28,600
Or are you going to fill me with sleeping pills
like they used to do at the hospital?

962
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,600
- No one is going to prevent me of getting out of here
- I will

963
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:32,080
- Not even you
- I will

964
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:33,840
Will see about that!

965
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:35,960
Or is it that I mean nothing in this house?

966
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:38,600
I am the older brother
I am the head of the family

967
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:41,360
Do you think that means anything to me?

968
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:43,960
At my age?

969
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:48,320
For me what counts is what people have in their
heads, and you have nothing in yours

970
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:53,840
I will not be a slave of your ignorance
anymore or of your prude conscience

971
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,680
An what about me?
I am also a slave

972
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:00,160
How do you think I felt when I left the sea?

973
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:03,840
All my life here, living out of this
fucking orchard

974
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:08,120
To be with you.
To be only with you

975
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:12,240
Me, my wife and my son.
All slaves!

976
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:33,880
- Hello
- Hello

977
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,840
- Your uncle is going to Boiro
- Boiro?

978
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,120
What for?

979
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:45,720
To spend some time there, he says

980
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:48,920
He's leaving with that woman, Rosa

981
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:55,720
- Are they getting married?
- No they're not

982
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:04,720
What is that about you leaving?

983
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:07,520
For how long?

984
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:11,920
I want to give you my book.
It's over there.

985
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:19,800
- But aren't there any more, or what?
- Yes of course, but that one is the first copy

986
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:23,200
Open it at the bookmark

987
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:29,520
- "To my son"?
- Yes. Read it please.

988
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:32,400
To my son

989
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,680
Forgive me son for not being born

990
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:38,600
It wasn't my fault to leave you behind

991
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:41,640
It were the roses the ones afraid

992
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:44,720
Forgive me for not had been able to play with you

993
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:48,240
I don't know if you were born after I passed

994
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:50,280
Remember always that I still love you

995
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:53,640
Give a kiss to your mother from me

996
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:55,200
And don't keep any resentment towards me

997
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,480
It's not good to hate.

998
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:58,200
So...did you get it?

999
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,600
- Yes
- Let's see

1000
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:09,120
Well, it's about a son you never had and
this is like you are speaking to him

1001
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:11,920
And you ask for forgiveness for not having him

1002
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:14,400
Ok. But what did I added down there?

1003
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:22,000
- "To Javier"
- So? - So what?

1004
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:25,440
Don't you see what I’m trying to say?

1005
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:28,760
But I’m not your son

1006
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:30,440
Of course not...

1007
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:33,600
But if I’m dedicating you that poem,
is for a reason, no?

1008
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:38,680
But I’m not your son

1009
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:43,320
I don't know what is that they teach you at school.
Get out of here. Get out.

1010
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:45,760
You are all so weird

1011
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:55,760
Ramon? How are you?
Wait a moment, I can't hear you

1012
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:02,680
- Tell me dear
- I'm leaving tomorrow

1013
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,720
Yes, Rosa told me this afternoon.
I'm sure you are impatient

1014
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:06,560
A little

1015
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:11,560
Hey Ramon, I’ve been researching
about that thing you know...

1016
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:14,960
- What? - Well that
thing... - The powder?

1017
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:23,080
Yes, the powder. You have to calculate an exact dose of 200mg.
But it is probable that it is a little painful...just so you know.

1018
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:33,280
Gené. I think is best if you forget about all this.
It worries me that someday you could be implicated in this.

1019
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:41,960
In fact, that's why I’m calling, I want to
say good bye and we shouldn't talk again

1020
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:46,320
It's for your safety.
You shouldn't even talk to Mark about this.

1021
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:58,400
- Yes, yes. I understand. So this is farewell.
- It's better this way

1022
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:05,400
Ok, ok...ok.
Let me tell you something...

1023
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:09,440
Ramon, think it through all the times that is necessary.

1024
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:18,360
Don't feel pressured. I mean, don't do it to set an example
or to not disappoint the public, or us or the association

1025
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:22,640
No one is pushing you to do it,
do you understand me?

1026
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:30,200
- Do you understand me Ramon?
- Not you too, Gené, please

1027
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:43,200
- I'm sorry Ramon
- Goodbye Gené

1028
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:48,240
Have a nice journey, partner.

1029
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:31,680
Good bye Manuela...

1030
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:37,960
and you Javi, please be good

1031
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:40,920
I understood what you meant with the poem

1032
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:45,320
Come here a moment

1033
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:51,520
Give me a hug

1034
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:15,320
Do me a favour.
Take care of your grandpa

1035
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:23,520
Well Ramon, here we go.

1036
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:43,760
Can you close the door, kid?

1037
01:44:57,240 --> 01:44:58,560
Come on, close it.

1038
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:42,200
What are you going to do in Boiro chief?

1039
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:47,000
I'm going to the beach.
For a change of view.

1040
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:50,560
A change of view? That's great

1041
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:13,440
This is the best I could find with the money you gave me.

1042
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:16,880
And I told them about the view.
Do you like it?

1043
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:22,560
- Where do I sign? -
What for? - To marry you.

1044
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,480
He fell asleep

1045
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:32,520
Of course.
Since I don't move at all.

1046
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:50,720
Ramon. If there's really life after death...

1047
01:46:53,120 --> 01:46:56,080
I know this is going to sound foolish, but...

1048
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:01,280
- Please send me a sign?
- A sign?

1049
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:09,080
Anything. I never was scared of spirits.
I will be very alert. Waiting. Will you do it?

1050
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:11,080
Of course.

1051
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:25,480
But, between you and me, I think that after we die
there's nothing. Just like before we are born. Nothing

1052
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:30,040
How can you be so sure Ramon?

1053
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:31,640
No one knows that

1054
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:33,360
No I’m not sure.

1055
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:42,800
It's just a feeling. It's like when my father
looks at the sky and says "Tomorrow is going to rain" and it does

1056
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:46,160
It's a feeling.

1057
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:53,840
But there's something you shouldn't forget.
I'm going to be in your dreams

1058
01:47:55,080 --> 01:48:00,640
I'm going to come at night to your bed
and we will make love

1059
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:04,680
And in case I don't tell you in your dreams
I tell you now

1060
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:12,440
Thanks Rosa, from the bottom of my heart.
Thanks

1061
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:35,920
Judges, political and religious authorities.
What does dignity mean to you?

1062
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:42,920
Whatever the answer of your conscience
know that for me, this is not a worthy life.

1063
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:48,680
I would have liked to at least die with dignity

1064
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:57,360
Today, tired of the institutional laziness,
I see myself forced to do it in hiding, like a criminal

1065
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:00,440
You should know that the processes conducting to my death

1066
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:06,720
has been carefully divided in small actions that do
not constitute a crime by themselves

1067
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:10,360
and have been executed by several friendly hands

1068
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:13,840
if even then, the state insists in punishing my helpers

1069
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:19,320
I would suggest that you cut their hands, because
that is all that they contributed

1070
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:23,880
The head, I mean the conscience was provided by me

1071
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:28,560
As you can see, to my side I have a
glass of water

1072
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:33,080
that contains a dose of potassium cyanide

1073
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:36,800
when I drink it I will cease to exist

1074
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:41,640
relinquishing my most precious property. My body

1075
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:48,680
I believe that living is a right
not an obligation, as has been in my case

1076
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:58,120
forced to accept this sad situation during 28 years,
4 months and some days

1077
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:05,640
After all this time I make a balance of the
road travelled and I can't account for the happiness

1078
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:12,840
Only the time that passed against my will,
during most of my life

1079
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:16,720
will be my ally from now on

1080
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:29,360
Only time and the evolution of consciences will decide
one day if my request was reasonable or not.

1081
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:06,000
Well...

1082
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:17,400
It's hot...

1083
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:38,080
- And Mark, is he coming?
- He is with our son on the beach. He loves the sea

1084
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:41,280
- They can't be thinking about getting in
- No! It's too cold

1085
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:43,360
- How are you?
- Fine

1086
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,200
- Is she going to understand me?
- Yes...

1087
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:55,720
- I mean, does she still follow conversations and such
- Yes, yes. Sometimes is a little difficult, but..

1088
01:52:57,880 --> 01:53:02,160
- Well...I'll go see her, see you later
- See you later

1089
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:19,360
Hello Julia

1090
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:23,480
Hello. How are you?

1091
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:29,400
- Fine, and you?
- Well...here

1092
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:38,400
You have a very nice house. Very beautiful

1093
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:46,400
Well, you know that Ramon left me many letters.

1094
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:51,440
I think that he had fun leaving
writings around after he died

1095
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:54,320
The thing is that the other day

1096
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:56,760
I found this letter for you.

1097
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:05,120
Ramon who?

1098
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:14,200
Ramon Sampedro...
Your friend

1099
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:19,520
I introduced you two.
Do you remember?

1100
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:24,200
You?

1101
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:26,960
Yes

1102
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:49,040
It's very nice in here.

1103
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:00,280
The sea inside, the sea inside...

1104
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:02,440
And in the weightlessness of the bottom

1105
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:03,840
where dreams come true

1106
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:07,080
two wills come together to make a wish come true

1107
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:08,960
Your look and my look

1108
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:10,920
like an echo repeating, without words

1109
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:13,200
Deeper,
Deeper

1110
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:16,200
beyond everything through the blood and the bones

1111
01:55:17,680 --> 01:55:18,800
But I always wake up

1112
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:20,760
and I always wish I’d be dead

1113
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:22,920
to stay with my mouth

1114
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:24,920
entangled in your hair
