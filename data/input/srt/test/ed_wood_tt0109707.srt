1
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:48,121
Greetings, my friend.

2
00:00:48,195 --> 00:00:51,221
You are interested
in the unknown...

3
00:00:51,298 --> 00:00:55,166
the mysterious,
the unexplainable.

4
00:00:55,235 --> 00:00:58,068
That is why you are here.

5
00:00:58,138 --> 00:01:00,163
And now,
for the first time...

6
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,903
we are bringing you
the full story of what happened.

7
00:01:03,977 --> 00:01:07,140
We are giving you all
the evidence, based only...

8
00:01:07,214 --> 00:01:10,012
on the secret testimony
of the miserable souls...

9
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:13,814
who survived
this terrifying ordeal.

10
00:01:13,887 --> 00:01:17,084
The incidents, places--

11
00:01:17,157 --> 00:01:20,593
My friend, we cannot keep this
a secret any longer.

12
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,561
Can your heart stand
the shocking facts...

13
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:29,091
of the true story
of Edward D. Wood,Jr.?

14
00:05:14,057 --> 00:05:17,151
It`s 8:1 5. We can`t hold
the curtain any longer.

15
00:05:17,227 --> 00:05:21,994
Cripes, what am I gonna tell the cast?
It`s press night and there`s no press.

16
00:05:22,065 --> 00:05:25,364
- Do you believe in ghosts?
- Nah, Tommy.

17
00:05:25,435 --> 00:05:28,029
That`s just kiddie
spook stories.

18
00:05:28,105 --> 00:05:31,506
Once you`re dead,
you stay dead.

19
00:05:31,575 --> 00:05:34,510
I don`t know, Bill.
Out on that battlefield today...

20
00:05:34,578 --> 00:05:39,914
I saw this woman in-- dressed in
white, floating above the dunes.

21
00:05:39,983 --> 00:05:42,247
Or maybe it was
just fatigue or...

22
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,787
maybe it`s
the indignities of war.

23
00:05:44,855 --> 00:05:46,789
Or maybe
it`s somethin` else.

24
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,927
Hey, I think
I see somethin`.

25
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:03,105
I offer you mortals
the Bird of Peace...

26
00:06:03,173 --> 00:06:05,767
so that you may
change your ways...

27
00:06:05,842 --> 00:06:08,538
and end this destruction.

28
00:06:15,185 --> 00:06:17,380
What a show!
Everyone was terrific.

29
00:06:17,454 --> 00:06:20,446
Paul, your second act monologue
actually gave me the chills.

30
00:06:20,524 --> 00:06:23,322
- Ah, thanks, Eddie.
- I got the early edition
hot off the presses!

31
00:06:23,393 --> 00:06:26,089
This is the big moment.

32
00:06:36,573 --> 00:06:40,509
Oh, what does that old queen
know? she didn`t even show.

33
00:06:43,347 --> 00:06:45,747
sent her copy boy
to do the dirty work.

34
00:06:45,816 --> 00:06:49,252
screw you, Miss Crowley.

35
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,186
Do I really have a face
like a horse?

36
00:06:52,255 --> 00:06:54,450
What does ``ostentatious`` mean?

37
00:06:54,524 --> 00:06:56,719
Hey, it`s not that bad.
You can`t concentrate on the negative.

38
00:06:56,793 --> 00:06:58,852
Look, he`s got some
nice things to say here.

39
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:02,194
``The soldiers` costumes are very
realistic.`` That`s positive!

40
00:07:02,265 --> 00:07:04,961
- Rave of the century.
- Well, I`ve seen a lot worse reviews.

41
00:07:05,035 --> 00:07:08,402
I`ve seen reviews where they
didn`t even mention the costumes.

42
00:07:08,472 --> 00:07:12,033
Like that last Francis the Mule picture.
It got terrible notices. Huge hit!

43
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:14,441
- Lines around the block.
- That`s right.

44
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:16,945
Don`t take it too seriously.
We`re all doing great work.

45
00:07:17,014 --> 00:07:19,539
- Do you really think so?
- Absolutely.

46
00:07:21,551 --> 00:07:25,749
Honey, what if I`m wrong?
What if I just don`t got it?

47
00:07:25,822 --> 00:07:28,689
Ed, it was only one review.

48
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:31,592
Orson Welles was only 26
when he made Citizen Kane.

49
00:07:31,662 --> 00:07:35,063
I`m already 30.

50
00:07:35,132 --> 00:07:37,293
Ed, you`re still young.

51
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:40,768
And this is the time in your life
when you`re supposed to be struggling.

52
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:45,467
I know. But I`m just scared that it`s
not gonna get any better than this.

53
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:50,772
Oh, I hate having
to wake up this early.

54
00:07:57,954 --> 00:08:00,388
Gosh, where`s my pink sweater?

55
00:08:01,658 --> 00:08:04,525
I can never seem to find
my clothes anymore.

56
00:08:10,087 --> 00:08:14,456
Hey, big shot! Get off your ass and get
this over to the executive building.

57
00:08:14,524 --> 00:08:17,459
-sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
-Hey, Charlie, there, come here.

58
00:08:17,527 --> 00:08:20,519
Come here. What`d I tell you
about watering these plants, huh?

59
00:08:20,597 --> 00:08:24,863
I want some water on `em! Don`t
sprinkle the damn things! soak `em!

60
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:36,512
Hi.

61
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,515
All right, people, settle!
And... action!

62
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:52,157
Wow! Look at these camels.

63
00:08:52,229 --> 00:08:55,289
These are real camels.

64
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:57,560
Gosh, where`d
they get real camels?

65
00:08:57,634 --> 00:09:00,933
Hey, you.
Move it outta here, huh?

66
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:07,810
Hey, Eddie!
Come in here.

67
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:11,006
I got some great
new stuff to show you.

68
00:09:21,358 --> 00:09:24,225
This is fantastic.
What are you gonna do with it?

69
00:09:24,294 --> 00:09:26,785
Probably file it away
and never see it again.

70
00:09:26,863 --> 00:09:29,093
Oh, it`s such a waste.

71
00:09:31,802 --> 00:09:36,865
Why, if I had half the chance,
I could make an entire movie
using this stock footage.

72
00:09:38,241 --> 00:09:41,904
The story opens on these
mysterious explosions.

73
00:09:41,978 --> 00:09:45,277
Nobody knows what`s causing them,
but it`s upsetting all the buffalo.

74
00:09:45,349 --> 00:09:48,284
so the military are called in
to solve the mystery.

75
00:09:48,352 --> 00:09:50,343
- You forgot the octopus.
- No, no.

76
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,083
I`m saving that for
my big underwater climax.

77
00:09:54,157 --> 00:09:58,321
- Hello. May I help you?
- Hello.

78
00:09:58,395 --> 00:10:01,262
They say he was a girl
trapped in a man`s body.

79
00:10:01,331 --> 00:10:03,390
I bet it hurt when
they cut his thing off.

80
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:06,402
- Ugh!
- What are you ladies gabbin` about?

81
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:11,601
You know that ChristineJorgensen freak?
He-- she-- It`s in Variety.

82
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:15,202
some producer`s makin`
a bio pic.

83
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:17,769
Really? I didn`t read
that story.

84
00:10:20,016 --> 00:10:24,715
Yes. I`ve got Mr. Edward Wood on
the line. Could you please hold?

85
00:10:27,257 --> 00:10:30,693
Mr. Weiss?
Ed Wood here.

86
00:10:30,761 --> 00:10:34,959
Listen, I-I heard about your
new project, and I was curious
if you`d signed a director yet?

87
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:37,090
Oh, you haven`t!

88
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:39,499
Well, if we could get together,
I could explain to you...

89
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:43,403
why I`m more qualified to direct
this than anyone else in town.

90
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:48,475
Well, I`d rather not
go into that over the phone.

91
00:10:48,545 --> 00:10:50,740
All right. Great!

92
00:10:50,814 --> 00:10:54,614
I`ll see ya then. Bye.

93
00:10:54,684 --> 00:10:57,414
Eddie, I don`t understand. Why are
you the most qualified director...

94
00:10:57,487 --> 00:11:00,615
- for the ChristineJorgensen story?
- Oh, it`s just hogwash, hon.

95
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,488
I had to get
in the door somehow.

96
00:11:23,113 --> 00:11:25,775
No, I love you like a brother.
Listen to me. No, no, no, no.

97
00:11:25,849 --> 00:11:30,309
No, no, no. I didn`t stop that.
That`s a falsehood. No. Listen.

98
00:11:30,387 --> 00:11:32,150
Come in!

99
00:11:32,222 --> 00:11:35,282
Look, look, look. When I said that you
could have the western territories...

100
00:11:35,358 --> 00:11:37,918
I didn`t mean all 1 1 states!

101
00:11:37,994 --> 00:11:40,861
I meant California,
Oregon, and, uh--

102
00:11:40,931 --> 00:11:43,661
What`s that one on top? Ah,
W-W-- Washington! Yeah, yeah!

103
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:45,997
Wh-- Oh, really?

104
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:48,003
Well, screw you!

105
00:11:49,473 --> 00:11:51,737
- Hi. Can I help ya?
- Yes, I`m Ed Wood.

106
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:55,073
I`m here about directing
the ChristineJorgensen picture.

107
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:56,874
Well, a couple of things
have changed.

108
00:11:56,947 --> 00:11:59,245
It ain`t gonna be the Christine
Jorgensen story no more.

109
00:11:59,316 --> 00:12:01,716
Goddamn Variety had to print
the story before I got the rights!

110
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:03,650
Now that bitch is asking
for the sky.

111
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,551
Ah, you`re not gonna
make the movie.

112
00:12:05,622 --> 00:12:07,715
No, of course I`m gonna
make the picture.

113
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,760
I already presold Alabama
and Oklahoma.

114
00:12:10,827 --> 00:12:14,456
Those repressed Okies, they go
for that twisted, perverted stuff.

115
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:17,091
We`ll just do it without the she-male.
We`ll fictionalize it.

116
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:20,603
- Is there a script?
- Fuck no! But there`s a poster.

117
00:12:23,874 --> 00:12:26,775
It opens in nine weeks
in Tulsa.

118
00:12:26,843 --> 00:12:29,368
Well, Mr. Weiss, look no further.
I`m your man.

119
00:12:29,446 --> 00:12:33,177
I work fast and I`m a deal.
I write and direct. And I`m good.

120
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,118
I just did a play in Hollywood
and Victor Crowley himself
praised its realism.

121
00:12:37,187 --> 00:12:40,020
There`s about 500 guys in this town
that can say the same thing.

122
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:43,582
On the phone you said you had
some special qualifications?

123
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:51,857
Mr. Weiss...

124
00:12:51,935 --> 00:12:54,301
I have never told anyone...

125
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:56,601
what I`m about to tell you...

126
00:12:56,673 --> 00:12:59,369
but I really want this job.

127
00:13:02,312 --> 00:13:05,611
I like to dress
in women`s clothing.

128
00:13:07,317 --> 00:13:09,911
- You`re a fruit?
- No, not at all. I love women.

129
00:13:09,986 --> 00:13:12,682
Wearing their clothes
makes me feel closer to them.

130
00:13:12,756 --> 00:13:16,283
- You`re not a fruit.
- No, I`m all man.
I even fought in W.W. II.

131
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:19,328
Of course, I was wearing
women`s undergarments under my uniform.

132
00:13:19,396 --> 00:13:22,263
- Ya gotta be kidding me.
- Confidentially...

133
00:13:22,332 --> 00:13:25,267
I even paratrooped wearing
a brassiere and panties.

134
00:13:25,335 --> 00:13:28,133
I tell ya, I wasn`t scared
of being killed, but I was
terrified of getting wounded...

135
00:13:28,204 --> 00:13:31,071
and having the medics
discover my secret.

136
00:13:31,141 --> 00:13:33,701
so you think this qualifies
you to make my movie?

137
00:13:33,777 --> 00:13:37,873
Yes. I know what it`s like
to live with a secret...

138
00:13:37,948 --> 00:13:41,543
and worry about what people
are gonna think of ya.

139
00:13:41,618 --> 00:13:46,385
My girlfriend still doesn`t know why
her sweaters are always stretched out.

140
00:13:46,456 --> 00:13:49,983
Ed, you seem like a nice kid.
Look around you.

141
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,655
I don`t hire directors with
burning desires to tell their stories.

142
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,721
I make movies
like Chained Girls.

143
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:59,360
I need someone with experience
who can shoot a film in four days
and make me a profit.

144
00:13:59,436 --> 00:14:02,667
I`m sorry.
That`s all that matters.

145
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:09,374
Can I get you
anything else, kid?

146
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,823
Too constrictive.
I can`t even fold my arms.

147
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:03,192
Gee, Mr. Lugosi, I`ve-I`ve
never had any complaints.

148
00:15:03,263 --> 00:15:06,596
This is the most uncomfortable
coffin I`ve ever been in.

149
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:10,397
Your selection is quite shoddy.
You`re wasting my time!

150
00:15:12,372 --> 00:15:15,273
- Mr. Lugosi.
- I told you I don`t want any
of your goddamn coffins!

151
00:15:15,341 --> 00:15:18,970
No, no. I don`t work here.

152
00:15:19,045 --> 00:15:20,979
- Then who are you? What do you want?
- I don`t want anything.

153
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:26,110
I just-- I`m a really big, big fan.
I`ve seen all your movies.

154
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:33,120
- Mr. Lugosi,
why are you buying a coffin?
- I`m planning on dying soon.

155
00:15:33,193 --> 00:15:36,856
- No.
- Yes! I`m embarking on another
bus and truck tour of Dracula.

156
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,956
Twelve cities in ten days,
if that`s conceivable.

157
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:43,628
Do you know that I saw you perform
Dracula in Poughkeepsie in 1 938?

158
00:15:43,703 --> 00:15:46,570
That was a terrible production.
Renfield was a drunk!

159
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,130
I thought it was great.
You know, you`re-you`re
much scarier in real life...

160
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:51,643
than you are in the movie.

161
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:53,372
Thank you.

162
00:15:53,446 --> 00:15:55,937
I even waited outside to get
your autograph, but you never came out.

163
00:15:56,015 --> 00:15:59,473
Well, I apologize. When I play Dracula,
I put myself into a trance.

164
00:15:59,552 --> 00:16:03,283
It takes me much time
to reemerge.

165
00:16:03,356 --> 00:16:06,792
Oh, there`s my bus.
shit! Where is my transfer?

166
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:12,298
- say, don`t you have a car?
- I refuse to drive in this country.
Too many madmen.

167
00:16:12,365 --> 00:16:14,856
I`ve got a car.

168
00:16:20,507 --> 00:16:23,772
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead
such an exciting life.

169
00:16:23,843 --> 00:16:25,902
When is your next picture
coming out?

170
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:28,311
I have no next picture.

171
00:16:28,381 --> 00:16:30,474
Ya gotta be jokin`.
A great star like you.

172
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,711
You must have dozens
of`em lined up.

173
00:16:32,786 --> 00:16:34,845
Back in the old days, yes.

174
00:16:34,921 --> 00:16:38,015
But now, no one gives
two fucks for Bela.

175
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:41,424
- But you`re a big star.
- No more.

176
00:16:41,494 --> 00:16:45,021
I haven`t worked
in four years.

177
00:16:45,098 --> 00:16:49,467
This business, this town,
it chews you up, then spits you out.

178
00:16:49,536 --> 00:16:53,768
I`m just an ex-bogeyman.
Make a right.

179
00:17:07,453 --> 00:17:11,651
They don`t want
the classic horror films anymore.

180
00:17:11,724 --> 00:17:14,921
Today, it`s all giant bugs.

181
00:17:14,994 --> 00:17:17,224
Giant spiders,
giant grasshoppers.

182
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:19,788
Who would believe
such nonsense?

183
00:17:19,866 --> 00:17:23,962
The old ones were much spookier;
they had castles and full moons.

184
00:17:24,037 --> 00:17:25,971
They were mythic.

185
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:28,473
- They had a poetry to them.
- Yes.

186
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:31,635
And you know what else?
The women--

187
00:17:31,711 --> 00:17:35,670
The women preferred
the traditional monsters.

188
00:17:35,748 --> 00:17:37,682
The women. Huh.

189
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,016
The pure horror, it both
repels and attracts them.

190
00:17:42,088 --> 00:17:44,784
Because in their
collective unconsciousness...

191
00:17:44,858 --> 00:17:46,917
they have the agony
of childbirth.

192
00:17:46,993 --> 00:17:49,257
- Oh.
- The blood--

193
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:51,661
The blood is horror.

194
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:55,495
You know, I never
thought of that.

195
00:17:56,669 --> 00:17:58,603
Take my word for it.

196
00:17:58,671 --> 00:18:03,404
If you want to make out with a young
lady, you take her to see Dracula.

197
00:18:11,751 --> 00:18:13,912
Eh, what a mess.

198
00:18:13,987 --> 00:18:16,888
My wife of 20 years
left me last month.

199
00:18:16,956 --> 00:18:20,255
I`m not much of a housekeeper.
All right, I`m coming!

200
00:18:20,326 --> 00:18:23,489
- I`ll feed you, my darlings.
I`ll feed you.
- Well, I better get going.

201
00:18:23,563 --> 00:18:27,192
But, uh, perhaps we could get together
again sometime, Mr. Lugosi.

202
00:18:28,468 --> 00:18:30,868
Certainly.
But now...

203
00:18:30,937 --> 00:18:34,930
the children of the night
are calling me.

204
00:18:37,911 --> 00:18:40,436
- Good day.
- Good day.

205
00:18:43,783 --> 00:18:46,718
sweetie, you won`t believe it.
I`ve got incredible news.

206
00:18:46,786 --> 00:18:50,916
- Ya got the job!
- No, I didn`t get the job,
but something better happened.

207
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,323
- Better than not getting the job.
- Yes!

208
00:18:54,394 --> 00:18:57,454
I met a movie star.
somebody really big.

209
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,691
Who? Robert Taylor?

210
00:18:59,766 --> 00:19:02,758
No. A horror movie star.

211
00:19:02,835 --> 00:19:05,269
- Boris Karloff.
- Close.

212
00:19:05,338 --> 00:19:07,272
The other one.

213
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:10,869
You met... Basil Rathbone!

214
00:19:10,944 --> 00:19:14,436
Oh, to heck with you.
I met Bela Lugosi.

215
00:19:14,514 --> 00:19:18,848
- Well, I thought he was dead.
- No, he`s very much alive.

216
00:19:18,918 --> 00:19:22,376
Well... sort of.

217
00:19:22,455 --> 00:19:26,755
He`s old and frail, but he`s-- he`s
still Bela Lugosi, and he`s really nice.

218
00:19:26,826 --> 00:19:29,659
Well, I can`t even remember
the last time I saw him in a picture.

219
00:19:29,729 --> 00:19:32,994
It`s a shame. He`s such a great actor,
and no one uses him anymore.

220
00:19:33,066 --> 00:19:35,899
-so, did you get his autograph?
-No, it wasn`t like that at all.

221
00:19:35,969 --> 00:19:40,338
It was just the two of us
and we were talking and--
He treated me like a friend.

222
00:19:40,406 --> 00:19:42,431
- Yeah, well, he`s a bum!
- No, he`s not.

223
00:19:42,508 --> 00:19:45,306
Do you have any idea how much
money he made for this studio?

224
00:19:45,378 --> 00:19:47,676
- Dracula, The Black Cat, The Raven.
- Yeah?

225
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:51,843
- Well, now he`s a junkie.
He don`t deserve to work.
- That is not true.

226
00:19:51,918 --> 00:19:54,079
He`s so great,
you hire him.

227
00:19:55,188 --> 00:19:58,282
Yeah, well I would
if I could.

228
00:19:58,788 --> 00:20:02,315
- Trick or treat!
- The house looks like
they have lots of kids.

229
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:30,419
Ooh, those eyes.
He gives me the willies.

230
00:20:30,486 --> 00:20:33,216
Oh, I hate it when she
interrupts the picture.

231
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:36,349
- she doesn`t show `em
the proper respect.
- ...Charlie from--

232
00:20:36,425 --> 00:20:39,826
- I think she`s a honey.
- ...talk about the living dead.

233
00:20:39,896 --> 00:20:41,989
- And then I tried to meet him...
- Look at those jugs.

234
00:20:42,064 --> 00:20:44,555
but he stood me up
at the restaurant.

235
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:48,195
I guess I shouldn`t
have picked a steak house.

236
00:20:48,271 --> 00:20:51,763
And then I went out with the
Wolf Man. Ugh. What an evening.!

237
00:20:51,841 --> 00:20:56,175
- I didn`t know whether
to kiss him good night--
- Vampira...

238
00:20:56,245 --> 00:20:59,214
you will come under
my spell.

239
00:21:01,017 --> 00:21:05,215
You will be
my slave of love.

240
00:21:05,288 --> 00:21:08,348
My gosh, Bela.
How do you do that?

241
00:21:08,424 --> 00:21:10,984
You must be double-jointed.

242
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,722
And you must be Hungarian.

243
00:21:15,331 --> 00:21:18,494
Vampira, look at me.

244
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:21,298
Look into my eyes.

245
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,237
You`re watching our
Halloween movie, White Zombie...

246
00:21:24,307 --> 00:21:28,107
starring Bela Lugosi,
John Harron, Madge Bellamy...

247
00:21:28,177 --> 00:21:31,613
and a bunch of other people
I`ve never heard of.

248
00:21:35,151 --> 00:21:37,244
I`m very tired.

249
00:21:38,654 --> 00:21:41,122
I need to take my medicine.

250
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,556
- Do you want me to get it for you?
- No.

251
00:21:43,626 --> 00:21:46,026
Thank you, Eddie.
I`ll be all right.

252
00:22:16,058 --> 00:22:17,992
Oh, shit!

253
00:22:33,476 --> 00:22:36,138
I feel much better.

254
00:22:36,212 --> 00:22:38,942
Children! I love children!

255
00:22:45,221 --> 00:22:47,746
Trick or treat!

256
00:22:49,058 --> 00:22:51,993
Aren`t you scared,
little boy?

257
00:22:52,061 --> 00:22:55,690
I`m going to drink
your blood.

258
00:22:55,765 --> 00:22:58,233
You`re not a real vampire.

259
00:22:58,301 --> 00:23:01,464
Those teeth
don`t frighten me.

260
00:23:02,872 --> 00:23:04,806
How `bout these?

261
00:23:07,543 --> 00:23:10,011
Hey, how`d you do that?

262
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:12,980
Dentures. Lost my pearlies
in the war.

263
00:23:15,347 --> 00:23:18,475
so, what was the important news you
couldn`t tell me on the phone, again?

264
00:23:18,551 --> 00:23:20,382
Well, I started thinkin` about
what you were saying about...

265
00:23:20,452 --> 00:23:22,477
how your movies need
to make a profit.

266
00:23:22,555 --> 00:23:26,116
Now, what is the one thing if you put
it in a movie, it`ll be successful?

267
00:23:26,192 --> 00:23:29,719
- Tits.
- No, better than that. A star.

268
00:23:29,795 --> 00:23:32,525
Ed, you must have me confused
with David selznick.

269
00:23:32,598 --> 00:23:34,828
I don`t make major motion pictures.
I make crap.

270
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,563
Yes, but if you take that crap and put
a star in it, then you`ve got something.

271
00:23:38,637 --> 00:23:41,663
- Yeah. Crap with a star.
- No, something better!

272
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,765
something impressive.

273
00:23:43,843 --> 00:23:47,609
Maybe the biggest money-maker
you`ve ever had.

274
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,773
Fine, all right.
You may be right.

275
00:23:49,849 --> 00:23:53,683
But it doesn`t frickin` matter.
I can`t afford a star, so what
are we even talkin` about?

276
00:23:53,752 --> 00:23:57,210
All right. What if I told you
you could have a star for $1 ,000?

277
00:23:58,991 --> 00:24:00,925
Who?

278
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:08,095
- Lugosi?
- Yes! Lugosi!

279
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:11,068
- Isn`t he dead?
- No, he`s not dead.
He lives in Baldwin Hills.

280
00:24:11,136 --> 00:24:14,697
I met him recently and he really
wants to be in our movie.

281
00:24:14,773 --> 00:24:18,402
- Why would Lugosi wanna do
a sex-change flick?
- Because he`s my friend.

282
00:24:22,481 --> 00:24:25,382
All right, fine! You can direct it.
I want a script in three days.

283
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:27,783
We start shooting
a week from Monday.

284
00:24:27,853 --> 00:24:30,083
Oh. Oh, Mr. Weiss.

285
00:24:30,155 --> 00:24:33,181
Thank you so much. You won`t
regret it. I won`t let you down.

286
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:40,292
But, Bunny, you`re perfect for
this job. You know these people.

287
00:24:40,366 --> 00:24:43,563
I need all the transsexuals
and transvestites I can get.

288
00:24:43,636 --> 00:24:46,434
No, I don`t care if they`re
not actors. I want realism.

289
00:24:46,505 --> 00:24:50,305
I want this film
to tell the truth. Coming!

290
00:24:50,376 --> 00:24:54,676
I`ve waited all my life for this shot,
and I`m not gonna blow it.

291
00:24:54,747 --> 00:24:57,648
Eddie, you got a new movie
for me, eh?

292
00:24:57,716 --> 00:25:00,651
Yes. It`s gonna be a great picture
and you`ll love your character.

293
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:03,847
Have a seat.

294
00:25:03,923 --> 00:25:08,053
Listen, Bunny, Bela`s here.
I gotta go. Now, listen...

295
00:25:08,127 --> 00:25:11,563
hit the bars, work some parties,
and get me transvestites.

296
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:14,793
I need transvestites!
All right. Bye.

297
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:20,227
Eddie, what kind
of a movie is this?

298
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:24,167
Well, it`s about how people
have two personalities.

299
00:25:24,243 --> 00:25:27,804
The side they show to the world, and
then the secret person they hide inside.

300
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,408
LikeJekyll and Hyde. I`ve always
wanted to playJekyll and Hyde.

301
00:25:32,484 --> 00:25:34,918
I`m looking forward
to this production.

302
00:25:34,987 --> 00:25:37,387
Well, your part`s
a little different.

303
00:25:37,456 --> 00:25:42,416
You`re like the god that looks over all
the characters and oversees everything.

304
00:25:42,494 --> 00:25:46,430
- I don`t understand.
- You control everyone`s fate.
You`re like the puppetmaster.

305
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,591
Ah, so I pull the strings.

306
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:53,331
Yes, you pull the strings.

307
00:25:53,405 --> 00:25:56,704
``Pull the strings.``
I like that!

308
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:06,075
Honey. I got
a little surprise for ya.

309
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,514
Wipe off your hands.

310
00:26:10,252 --> 00:26:13,380
- I finished my script.
- Oh!

311
00:26:13,455 --> 00:26:15,889
Ed, I`m so proud of you!

312
00:26:18,227 --> 00:26:20,388
Oh, I`ll read it
as soon as I get home.

313
00:26:20,462 --> 00:26:23,397
Well, I`d-- Well, you know,
I`d really like to know what you think.

314
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:27,299
Why don`t you go in the bedroom
and take a look? I`ll wait.

315
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:29,769
Go ahead.

316
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,102
Take your time.

317
00:27:18,487 --> 00:27:21,149
so that`s where
my sweater`s been.

318
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:26,255
How long have you
been doing this?

319
00:27:26,328 --> 00:27:28,592
since I was a kid.

320
00:27:28,664 --> 00:27:33,328
My mom wanted a girl, so she
used to dress me in girlie clothing.

321
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,632
Just became a habit.

322
00:27:35,704 --> 00:27:38,537
Jesus Christ!
And you never told me?

323
00:27:38,607 --> 00:27:40,802
Well, this is my way
of telling you.

324
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:44,073
What? By putting it in a fucking
script for everyone to see?

325
00:27:44,146 --> 00:27:46,706
What kind of sick mind
operates like that?

326
00:27:46,782 --> 00:27:51,082
And what about this, this so-called
Barbara character that`s obviously me.

327
00:27:51,153 --> 00:27:53,485
I mean, this is our life.
It`s so embarrassing!

328
00:27:53,555 --> 00:27:55,648
Of course it is. That`s why
you should play the part.

329
00:27:55,724 --> 00:27:58,420
- Oh, you got nerve, buddy.
- It`s a darn good role.

330
00:27:58,494 --> 00:28:00,724
That`s not the issue!

331
00:28:00,796 --> 00:28:04,357
God, how can you act so casual
when you`re dressed like that?

332
00:28:06,735 --> 00:28:08,930
It makes me
feel comfortable.

333
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:11,802
Oh,just like
in the script.

334
00:28:11,874 --> 00:28:13,808
Exactly.

335
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:19,777
so what do you say?

336
00:28:19,848 --> 00:28:21,873
Do we break up?

337
00:28:24,686 --> 00:28:27,678
Or do you want to make
the movie with me?

338
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:33,550
They make you tall, and
you`re flashy. They want that.

339
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:36,655
Okay. But they want professionalism,
so nix on the nelly...

340
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:39,394
without losing
naivete, okay?

341
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:43,165
Now, the good news is you`re
probably gonna get hired
because you look like Peggy Lee.

342
00:28:43,238 --> 00:28:46,435
But I don`t want anybody else
to resent that, okay? Please?

343
00:28:46,508 --> 00:28:48,999
`Cause there`s enough
for everybody, exotics too.

344
00:28:49,077 --> 00:28:52,069
David, if you`re not gonna smile, please
don`t bother. You`ll embarrass me.

345
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:55,548
-This is George Weiss. He`s done
some very important things.
-You`re wrong. They work
with high artistic merit.

346
00:28:55,617 --> 00:28:58,142
- He`s a nice person to know. An
important person to know, huh?
- I thought you were gonna make
a sex change film!

347
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,552
- There is still a sex change film.
- Yeah! Five pages before it ends!

348
00:29:00,622 --> 00:29:03,147
The rest is about some schmuck
who likes angora sweaters!

349
00:29:03,225 --> 00:29:05,659
Well, I don`t think
he`s a schmuck.

350
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:09,254
What about this title?
My poster says I Changed My Sex.

351
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,663
so change the poster. Trust me.
You`ll be better off.

352
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:14,759
This story`s gonna grab people.
It`s about this guy.

353
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,202
He`s crazy about this girl,
but he likes to wear dresses.

354
00:29:17,272 --> 00:29:21,265
should he tell her? should he not tell
her? He`s torn, Georgie. This is drama.

355
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:25,905
Fine. shoot whatever baloney you want.
Just make sure it`s seven reels long.

356
00:29:28,408 --> 00:29:30,535
Testing.

357
00:29:30,611 --> 00:29:33,136
Excuse me. Can I get
everyone`s attention, please?

358
00:29:33,213 --> 00:29:35,943
Could you gather around?

359
00:29:38,352 --> 00:29:41,253
I`ve got something to say.
Everybody...

360
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:45,087
we`re about to embark on quite a
journey; four days of hard work.

361
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:49,288
But when it`s over, we`ll have a picture
that`ll entertain, enlighten...

362
00:29:49,363 --> 00:29:51,695
and maybe even move
millions of people.

363
00:29:51,765 --> 00:29:55,428
Excuse me, Eddie.
I don`t mean to interrupt,
but I`m worried about the light.

364
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,834
Good thinking. All right, we`ll talk
about days three and four later.

365
00:29:57,904 --> 00:30:02,273
Let`s get that first shot off.
scene 1 7: Glenda looking in the window.

366
00:30:03,777 --> 00:30:05,711
And... action!

367
00:30:21,995 --> 00:30:26,056
And... cut! Print that.
Let`s move on.

368
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:28,192
Don`t you want a second take
for protection?

369
00:30:28,268 --> 00:30:31,635
What`s to protect?
It was perfect! Come on.

370
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:34,435
Hey! Cops!

371
00:30:35,842 --> 00:30:37,969
We don`t have a permit.
Run!

372
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:41,879
- Oh!
-Just get it.
- Come on. Let`s go.

373
00:30:46,687 --> 00:30:49,713
What`s going on with these
revised pages? scene--

374
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:53,487
- Mr. Lugosi`s here.
- Oh, my God, Mr. Lugosi`s here!

375
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,494
Everyone! Everyone!

376
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,930
Everyone, come on,
come in here.

377
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:07,172
Listen. When he walks onto
the stage, treat him normal.

378
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,370
I know Bela Lugosi`s a world-famous
star, and you`re all very excited...

379
00:31:11,445 --> 00:31:13,845
but, look,
we are professionals.

380
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:17,714
so,just treat him with respect.
Everything will be all right.

381
00:31:24,825 --> 00:31:26,759
Bela!

382
00:31:31,031 --> 00:31:34,091
Great to see ya.
8:00 on the dot. Right on time.

383
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:36,567
- I`m always on time.
- Of course you are.

384
00:31:36,636 --> 00:31:38,604
Well, we got a big day
planned for you.

385
00:31:38,672 --> 00:31:41,573
But first we`re gonna
start out kinda easy with you
in that armchair over there.

386
00:31:41,641 --> 00:31:43,370
And then once you`re
up to speed and cookin`...

387
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,173
we`ll reset and bring in
the laboratory equipment.

388
00:31:46,246 --> 00:31:48,180
- Eddie?
- Huh?

389
00:31:51,752 --> 00:31:54,516
- What about my money?
- Huh? Oh.

390
00:32:10,237 --> 00:32:13,001
What are you people doing?
Get back to work!

391
00:32:30,624 --> 00:32:33,422
All right, people.
Let`s get ready.

392
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,870
Mr. Lugosi,
I-I know you`re very busy...

393
00:32:45,939 --> 00:32:48,533
but, um... can I have
your autograph?

394
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,844
Certainly.

395
00:32:55,715 --> 00:32:59,481
You know which movie of yours
I love, Mr. Lugosi? The Invisible Ray.

396
00:32:59,553 --> 00:33:02,954
You were great
as Karloff`` s sidekick.

397
00:33:04,891 --> 00:33:07,485
Karloff?

398
00:33:07,561 --> 00:33:11,224
sidekick?
Fuck you!

399
00:33:12,766 --> 00:33:15,530
Karloff does not deserve
to smell my shit!

400
00:33:15,602 --> 00:33:19,868
That limey cocksucker can rot
in hell for all I care!

401
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,909
-What happened?
-How dare that asshole bring up Karloff.

402
00:33:22,976 --> 00:33:25,274
You think it takes talent
to play Frankenstein?

403
00:33:25,345 --> 00:33:28,906
It`s all, all makeup
and, and, grunting.

404
00:33:28,982 --> 00:33:31,678
I agree.
Bela, I agree 1 00%.

405
00:33:31,751 --> 00:33:34,777
Now, Dracula, that`s a role
that requires talent.

406
00:33:34,855 --> 00:33:37,881
Of course!
Dracula requires presence.

407
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:41,655
It-- It`s all in the eyes
and the voice and the hand.

408
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,697
That`s right. That`s right.
You seem a little agitated.

409
00:33:44,764 --> 00:33:47,232
- You wanna go outside and get some air?
- Bullshit!

410
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,291
I`m ready now!
Roll the camera!

411
00:33:50,937 --> 00:33:53,303
- Move it, huh?
- We`re rolling.

412
00:33:53,373 --> 00:33:56,206
- sound. speed.
- scene 97, take one. Mark.

413
00:33:58,178 --> 00:34:00,112
Action.

414
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,884
Beware.

415
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,021
Beware.

416
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:14,416
Beware of the big,
green dragon...

417
00:34:14,494 --> 00:34:17,520
that sits on your doorstep.

418
00:34:18,632 --> 00:34:21,362
He eats little boys...

419
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,561
puppy dog tails...

420
00:34:23,637 --> 00:34:27,471
and big, fat snails.

421
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:31,435
Beware.

422
00:34:31,511 --> 00:34:33,672
Take care.

423
00:34:35,582 --> 00:34:37,516
Beware.

424
00:34:38,985 --> 00:34:41,146
Wait!

425
00:34:43,823 --> 00:34:47,919
Pull the string!
Pull the string!

426
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,564
Cut.

427
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:55,964
Perfect.

428
00:34:56,036 --> 00:34:59,199
Look, Georgie, I`m proud.
I wrote, directed and starred in it...

429
00:34:59,272 --> 00:35:01,433
-just like Orson Welles did
in Citizen Kane.
- Yeah, well...

430
00:35:01,508 --> 00:35:04,705
Orson Welles didn`t wear
angora sweaters, did he?

431
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:16,715
How can you just walk around
like that in front of all these people?

432
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:20,453
Well, hon, nobody`s bothered
but you. Look around.

433
00:35:20,527 --> 00:35:24,258
Ed, this isn`t the real world.
You`ve surrounded yourself
with a bunch of weirdos!

434
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:28,233
Oh, say it a little louder.
I don`t think Bela heard you.

435
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:37,476
Dolores.

436
00:35:38,745 --> 00:35:40,679
I need your help.

437
00:35:42,582 --> 00:35:46,074
My mind`s in a muddle,
like in a thick fog.

438
00:35:48,822 --> 00:35:51,484
I thought I could stop
wearing these things.

439
00:35:51,558 --> 00:35:54,391
I tried.
Honestly, I tried.

440
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:14,276
Glen. I don`t
fully understand.

441
00:36:15,448 --> 00:36:19,111
But maybe together
we can work this out.

442
00:36:43,676 --> 00:36:46,975
Music swells.
Cut and print!

443
00:36:47,047 --> 00:36:48,981
It`s a wrap.

444
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:56,454
How do you do?
I`m here to see Mr. Feldman.

445
00:36:56,522 --> 00:36:58,820
- What`s your name?
- Edward D. Wood,Jr.

446
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:13,537
He`s in the executive building.
You can park in the reserved section.

447
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:16,598
- Thanks very much.
- Please, sit down.

448
00:37:16,676 --> 00:37:19,941
Thanks.

449
00:37:20,012 --> 00:37:23,914
so, what are you bringing me?
Looks like you got some film cans.

450
00:37:23,983 --> 00:37:27,544
Well, some people bring their resumes.
I`ve brought my own movie.

451
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,680
Really? Well, good for you.

452
00:37:30,756 --> 00:37:34,715
I just shot this baby for screen
Classics. It opens next week.

453
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,661
screen Classics?
No, I don`t know them.

454
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:42,258
There`s something you should know.
Nobody in town has seen this picture...

455
00:37:42,334 --> 00:37:45,428
so I`m giving you first crack
at my talents.

456
00:37:45,504 --> 00:37:49,804
Thank you.
And I`m anxious to see it.

457
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:52,275
-so, uh, what`s up next for you?
-Well, you know...

458
00:37:52,344 --> 00:37:56,576
I don`t believe in thinking small,
so I`ve got a whole slate
of pictures for you.

459
00:37:56,649 --> 00:38:00,085
You ready? Okay.

460
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:03,849
``The Vampire`s Tomb.``

461
00:38:03,923 --> 00:38:06,721
``The Ghoul Goes West.``

462
00:38:08,961 --> 00:38:10,895
And...

463
00:38:12,565 --> 00:38:14,533
``Doctor Acula.``

464
00:38:16,736 --> 00:38:20,399
Doctor Acula?
I don`t get it.

465
00:38:22,908 --> 00:38:26,639
``Doctor... Racula.``

466
00:38:26,712 --> 00:38:30,739
Oh, I get it.
I don`t like it.

467
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:36,152
- But it`ll star Bela Lugosi.
- Bela Lugosi?

468
00:38:36,222 --> 00:38:38,816
Lugosi`s all washed-up.
What else you got?

469
00:38:42,595 --> 00:38:46,395
Well, I-I-I do have...
another project.

470
00:38:46,465 --> 00:38:48,695
I wasn`t gonna tell you
about it.

471
00:38:48,768 --> 00:38:51,293
Lugosi`s in it,
but it`s a small part.

472
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:56,672
The lead is an ingenue. A sterling,
young actress: Dolores Fuller.

473
00:38:58,144 --> 00:39:00,510
The title of the film:

474
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:03,514
``Bride of the Atom``!

475
00:39:03,582 --> 00:39:05,573
Ah.

476
00:39:05,651 --> 00:39:08,119
Atomic age stuff, huh?

477
00:39:10,956 --> 00:39:13,117
I like it. I like it.

478
00:39:13,192 --> 00:39:16,093
I`ll tell you what, Mr. Ward. Uh, why
don`t you leave your film cans with me.

479
00:39:16,162 --> 00:39:18,596
And my associates and I will
take a look at your little opus...

480
00:39:18,664 --> 00:39:21,189
and maybe we can do
some business together.

481
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:25,964
Take care. Beware.

482
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:31,342
Pull the string.!
Pull the string.!

483
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,810
- The title of this
can only be labeled...
- What the hell is this?

484
00:39:33,879 --> 00:39:36,712
- Is this an actual movie?
- "Behind Locked Doors. `"
- It can`t be!

485
00:39:36,782 --> 00:39:40,513
Give this man satin undies,
a dress, a sweater and a skirt...

486
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,645
or even the lounging outfit
that he has on...

487
00:39:42,721 --> 00:39:45,485
- and he`s the happiest
human being in the world.
- Wait a minute.

488
00:39:45,558 --> 00:39:49,187
- Wait a minute. That guy in the dress.
- He works better. He thinks better.
He can play better.

489
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,593
- And he`s a more of a credit
to his community...
- That`s the guy I met today.

490
00:39:51,664 --> 00:39:54,064
-and his government and he`s happy.
- Oh, this has gotta be a put-on.

491
00:39:54,133 --> 00:39:56,761
These things are his comfort.

492
00:39:56,836 --> 00:40:00,499
-But while in ladies makeup,
he dares to enter the street...
-This is probably another one of
Billy Wellman`s practical jokes.

493
00:40:00,573 --> 00:40:03,371
dressed in the clothes
he so much desires to wear...

494
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:06,468
but only ifhe
really appears female

495
00:40:06,545 --> 00:40:09,343
- the long hair, the makeup,
the clothing...
- Oh, God!

496
00:40:09,415 --> 00:40:11,975
the actual contours
of a girl.

497
00:40:12,051 --> 00:40:15,987
- Most transvestites do not want
to change their life, their bodies.
- This is funny. This is funny.

498
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,530
Thank you.

499
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,040
Georgie, what happened? I thought
Glen Or Glenda? was opening this week.

500
00:40:41,113 --> 00:40:43,104
- Where`s the ads?
- Where`s the ads?

501
00:40:43,182 --> 00:40:47,516
The ads are in Alabama,
Indiana, Missouri, you schmuck!
It ain`t gonna play in L.A.

502
00:40:47,586 --> 00:40:50,578
-Why not?
-Nobody wants to see this piece of shit!

503
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:55,320
- Hey, you can`t talk that way
about my movie!
- Your movie? I wish it was your movie!

504
00:40:55,394 --> 00:40:59,160
I wish I hadn`t blown every dime
I ever made into making this stink bomb!

505
00:40:59,231 --> 00:41:02,029
And if I ever see you again,
I`ll kill ya!

506
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:08,333
Hello?
Georgie?

507
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,735
Guess where
I`m going next week?

508
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:24,178
- I don`t know. Where?
- Mexico.

509
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:27,877
- Guess what I`m doing when I get there?
- I don`t know. Lie on a beach.

510
00:41:27,951 --> 00:41:32,251
Wrong. I`m getting my first
series of hormone injections.

511
00:41:32,322 --> 00:41:34,313
And when those girls
kick in...

512
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:38,521
they`re gonna take out my organs
and make me a woman.

513
00:41:38,595 --> 00:41:43,328
- Are you serious?
- It`s something I`ve wanted
to do for a long time.

514
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,461
But it wasn`t until I saw
your movie that I realized
that I have to take action!

515
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:50,200
- Good-bye, penis.
- Would you please keep it down.

516
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:54,210
The ``super swedish Angel,``
TorJohnson!

517
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:08,619
My gosh, look at that guy.
He`s a mountain!

518
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:31,305
And after I`m a woman,
Jean-Claude and I are gonna be married.

519
00:42:31,381 --> 00:42:33,849
I`m gonna be a June bride.

520
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:37,512
He`s a monster. Can you imagine what
that guy would look like in a movie?

521
00:42:45,295 --> 00:42:47,991
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah!

522
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,693
Mmm. More neck.

523
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:56,204
Mr.Johnson, congratulations
on your victory.

524
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:58,639
Thank you.
You bring my water?

525
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:01,769
No, I`m not the water boy.
I`m a movie director.

526
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,746
- Movies? Like the Mickey Mouse?
- sure.

527
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:08,911
- I`ll get you next week!
- Yeah, right. In your dreams!

528
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:13,447
Tor--
Uh, Mr.Johnson?

529
00:43:13,523 --> 00:43:17,459
- Did you ever fancy the notion
of becoming an actor?
- Not good-lookin` enough.

530
00:43:17,527 --> 00:43:21,054
Well... I think
you`re quite handsome.

531
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:24,191
Do my toes!

532
00:43:24,267 --> 00:43:28,761
so, anyway, I`ve got this
new script, Bride of the Atom.

533
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:31,103
And there`s a part
that I believe you`re ideal for.

534
00:43:31,174 --> 00:43:35,474
Lobo. He`s, he`s tough. He`s a brute.
But he`s got a good heart.

535
00:43:35,545 --> 00:43:38,036
And at the end of the picture,
he saves the girl.

536
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:41,141
- I like. When the movie shoot?
- Hopefully, very soon.

537
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:44,676
I`m just waiting for the final okay from
my good pal at Warners, Mr. Feldman.

538
00:43:49,323 --> 00:43:52,986
- Wood Productions.
- Eddie, help me.

539
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:57,360
- Bela?
- Eddie, please come over.

540
00:43:57,431 --> 00:43:59,365
Bela?

541
00:44:20,087 --> 00:44:22,021
Bela?

542
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:26,292
Bela.

543
00:44:36,903 --> 00:44:39,963
Bela! Bela, what happened?

544
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,974
Eddie...

545
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:45,269
I didn`t feel well.

546
00:44:47,647 --> 00:44:51,413
- Come on. Let me get you
to the hospital.
- No hospital.

547
00:44:51,485 --> 00:44:53,680
Just take me to the couch.

548
00:44:55,622 --> 00:44:57,214
should I call a doctor?

549
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:00,782
No. This happens
all the time.

550
00:45:04,164 --> 00:45:07,497
Is there anything I can get
for you? Water or a blanket?

551
00:45:09,102 --> 00:45:10,592
Goulash.

552
00:45:12,506 --> 00:45:15,441
I don`t know how
to make goulash.

553
00:45:19,613 --> 00:45:22,946
Bela, what`s in the needle?

554
00:45:23,016 --> 00:45:27,112
Morphine, with a Demerol chaser.

555
00:45:29,756 --> 00:45:31,587
Oh, Eddie.

556
00:45:31,658 --> 00:45:35,492
Eddie, I`m so broke.

557
00:45:35,562 --> 00:45:38,497
I don`t know what
I`m going to do.

558
00:45:43,069 --> 00:45:45,833
Don`t worry, Bela.

559
00:45:45,906 --> 00:45:47,965
I won`t let you down.

560
00:45:51,344 --> 00:45:54,006
Mr. Feldman? Ed Wood.

561
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,844
Yeah, listen, I haven`t been able
to get through, so I just showed up.

562
00:45:56,917 --> 00:46:01,013
Yeah, right out front. so, are
we gonna be working together?

563
00:46:02,956 --> 00:46:06,687
Really? Worst film
you ever saw.

564
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,991
Well, my next one
will be better.

565
00:46:10,063 --> 00:46:12,793
Hello. Hello.

566
00:46:15,368 --> 00:46:19,532
- I`m no good.
- Oh, Ed, it was just one man`s opinion.

567
00:46:19,606 --> 00:46:23,269
Bela needs a job.
I can`t even get a film going.

568
00:46:23,343 --> 00:46:26,039
Of course I can`t. I made
the worst movie of all time.

569
00:46:26,112 --> 00:46:29,138
Oh, that`s ridiculous.

570
00:46:29,216 --> 00:46:32,014
All I wanna do
is tell stories.

571
00:46:32,085 --> 00:46:35,020
The things that
I find interesting.

572
00:46:35,088 --> 00:46:38,421
Well, maybe you`re not
studio kinda material.

573
00:46:38,492 --> 00:46:41,120
Maybe you just need
to raise the money yourself.

574
00:46:44,264 --> 00:46:46,755
The movie is called
Bride of the Atom.

575
00:46:46,833 --> 00:46:49,666
It would star Bela Lugosi.

576
00:46:49,736 --> 00:46:52,603
There are quarter shares
available at $1 5,000 each.

577
00:46:52,672 --> 00:46:56,836
Yes, that`s right.
The Bela Lugosi.

578
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:59,208
He`s still alive.

579
00:46:59,279 --> 00:47:01,213
Huh?

580
00:47:01,281 --> 00:47:05,479
Is he available Friday night?
Well, gee, I suppose so. Why?

581
00:47:07,153 --> 00:47:09,553
``Greetings,
I am the Count.``

582
00:47:09,623 --> 00:47:12,854
``Greetings, I am slick slomopavitz,
seeker of adventure.

583
00:47:12,926 --> 00:47:16,862
Audience laughs, applause.
say, that`s a kooky place to sleep.``

584
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:19,831
- ``It is my home.``
- ``Oh, tract housing, huh?

585
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,768
Laugh. You need
a new real estate agent.``

586
00:47:23,837 --> 00:47:27,068
``Beg to differ.
This casket,`` uh...

587
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,700
``incap-- incarpertate--``

588
00:47:29,776 --> 00:47:34,736
No, Bela, that`s ``incorporates.``
Look, why don`t you just say
that ``This casket has--``

589
00:47:34,814 --> 00:47:37,783
How do they expect a Hungarian
to pronounce this dialogue?

590
00:47:37,851 --> 00:47:40,843
This-- This live television
is madness!

591
00:47:40,921 --> 00:47:43,082
Furthermore,
I predict by...

592
00:47:43,156 --> 00:47:46,683
April 1 9th, 1 97 0...

593
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:51,026
I predict men will have
colonized Mars.

594
00:47:51,097 --> 00:47:53,497
Millions of people
will live there.

595
00:47:53,567 --> 00:47:57,059
Wow. Ain`t that somethin`?

596
00:48:00,073 --> 00:48:04,032
And now we take you
to a castle in Transylvania.

597
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:08,342
Watch out. The landlord`s
a real pain in the neck.

598
00:48:26,132 --> 00:48:29,499
Greetings. I am the Count.

599
00:48:29,569 --> 00:48:34,370
Greetings, pal. I`m slick slomopavitz,
seeker of adventure.

600
00:48:34,441 --> 00:48:38,104
Hey, what a kooky place to sleep.
Kinda reminds me of my house.

601
00:48:38,178 --> 00:48:42,205
Huh, what a dump. some places
got a Murphy bed, this place
got a Murphy shower!

602
00:48:42,282 --> 00:48:45,479
I still don`t know
where to hang the towels.

603
00:48:45,552 --> 00:48:47,383
I beg to differ.

604
00:48:47,454 --> 00:48:52,289
Beg to differ? Hey, uh, bloodsucker,
I`m, uh, talkin` about my towels.

605
00:48:56,396 --> 00:49:00,924
Greetings. I am the Count.

606
00:49:05,372 --> 00:49:07,306
Damn!

607
00:49:12,545 --> 00:49:15,844
A natural bum is what he is.
I told you we shoulda got Karloff.

608
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,953
- Ah, don`t worry about it, Bela.
You`re better than all this.
- I never said I could ad lib.

609
00:49:24,024 --> 00:49:27,790
Forget it. We`ll make our own movie
and you`ll be a big star again.

610
00:49:27,861 --> 00:49:32,628
Mr. Lugosi, it is an
unparalleled privilege to meet you, sir.

611
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:36,362
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Criswell.

612
00:49:36,436 --> 00:49:39,496
- It`s a pleasure.
- Ahh, cheer up.

613
00:49:39,572 --> 00:49:42,200
Don`t lose heart over
what happened tonight.

614
00:49:42,275 --> 00:49:46,609
I predict your next project
will be an outstanding success.

615
00:49:48,381 --> 00:49:51,680
- Wow.
- And who may you be?

616
00:49:51,751 --> 00:49:53,275
Edward D. Wood,Jr.

617
00:49:53,353 --> 00:49:57,881
- Ahh, the director of Glen or Glenda?
- H-How did you know?

618
00:49:57,957 --> 00:50:01,358
I am Criswell. I know all.

619
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,799
And bingo! Thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you.

620
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:18,567
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Uh,
bring me two more Beefeater martinis.

621
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:21,838
Ed, another whiskey.
Dagmar, rum and Coke.

622
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:25,141
Uh, Moustapha and King,
a chablis.

623
00:50:25,214 --> 00:50:28,081
Bela, would you like
a wine?

624
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:31,483
No. I never drink wine.

625
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:40,652
say, Cris, how`d you know
we`d be living on Mars by 1 97 0?

626
00:50:40,729 --> 00:50:43,892
- I guessed.
- Really?

627
00:50:43,966 --> 00:50:47,094
I made it up.
It`s horseshit.

628
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:52,633
Eddie, there`s no such thing as
a psychic. People believe my folderol...

629
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:55,939
because I wear
a black tuxedo.

630
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:58,946
- It`s that easy?
- Eddie, we`re in showbiz.

631
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:02,575
It`s all about razzle-dazzle,
appearances.

632
00:51:02,651 --> 00:51:06,246
If you look good and you talk well,
people will swallow anything.

633
00:51:14,826 --> 00:51:19,092
We are going to have the most
terrifying monster ever seen on film.

634
00:51:19,164 --> 00:51:23,624
A ghastly creature,
created from an atomic mutation!

635
00:51:23,702 --> 00:51:27,604
I don`t like scary movies.
I like the ones with love stories.

636
00:51:27,673 --> 00:51:30,437
That`s just what this movie is:
a heartbreaking romance.

637
00:51:30,509 --> 00:51:34,036
You`re quite a specimen.
And you`re going to be in the picture?

638
00:51:34,112 --> 00:51:37,081
- Yeah, I play Lobo.
- I predict Bride of the Atom...

639
00:51:37,149 --> 00:51:40,050
will be the biggest moneymaker
of all time.

640
00:51:40,118 --> 00:51:43,952
And this is lovely starlet Dolores
Fuller, who will playJanet Lawton.

641
00:51:44,022 --> 00:51:47,389
My pleasure, ma`am. Now,
how much will this picture cost?

642
00:51:47,459 --> 00:51:50,724
Well, in a normal studio,
it`d be about a million bucks...

643
00:51:50,796 --> 00:51:53,629
with all their wasteful overhead
and fancy offices.

644
00:51:53,699 --> 00:51:57,533
But we`re more efficient, so we
could bring it in at about 7 0 grand.

645
00:51:57,602 --> 00:52:00,469
Oh. Well, I shall
certainly consider it.

646
00:52:00,539 --> 00:52:02,837
- Well, good-bye.
- Bye. stay in touch.
- Good night, Ed.

647
00:52:02,908 --> 00:52:04,876
- Good party, Ed.
- Good-bye.

648
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,043
- Well, Eddie, how`d we do?
- We didn`t make a nickel.

649
00:52:13,552 --> 00:52:16,612
I cannot believe
I`m in Hollywood.

650
00:52:16,688 --> 00:52:19,521
You know, Daddy didn`t want me
to move out here.

651
00:52:19,591 --> 00:52:24,119
Uh-huh. Ma`am,
your bill comes to $2.20.

652
00:52:24,196 --> 00:52:29,031
Oh. Uh, okay. I hope you don`t mind,
but all I have is a 50.

653
00:52:29,101 --> 00:52:31,194
- I just came from my banker`s.
- That`s all right.

654
00:52:31,269 --> 00:52:33,203
Thank you.

655
00:52:39,845 --> 00:52:41,745
Excuse me.
You just moved here?

656
00:52:41,813 --> 00:52:45,374
Yes. Hollywood is,
oh, so exciting.

657
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:47,077
Isn`t it?

658
00:52:47,152 --> 00:52:50,485
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
I`m Loretta King.

659
00:52:50,555 --> 00:52:54,321
- Edward D. Wood,Jr.
- Hi, would you like some water?

660
00:52:54,392 --> 00:52:57,987
No. No water. No liquids.

661
00:52:58,063 --> 00:53:00,497
I`m terribly allergic
to them.

662
00:53:02,934 --> 00:53:05,027
You know, I work in Hollywood.
I`m a producer.

663
00:53:05,103 --> 00:53:09,767
Really? Wow. I would love
to be involved in that.

664
00:53:09,841 --> 00:53:12,810
Is that right?
Well, maybe I can help you out.

665
00:53:12,878 --> 00:53:16,336
Have you ever thought about
investing in a motion picture?

666
00:53:16,414 --> 00:53:20,851
Perhaps a small amount of money.
How much do your motion pictures cost?

667
00:53:20,919 --> 00:53:24,252
Well, my new one, I think,
would be about $60,000.

668
00:53:24,322 --> 00:53:28,315
That`s all? That seems
very reasonable for an entire picture.

669
00:53:31,429 --> 00:53:34,159
Would you--
Would you like to, uh...

670
00:53:34,232 --> 00:53:36,166
have a look at the--
at the photoplay?

671
00:53:36,234 --> 00:53:38,168
Oh, sure.

672
00:53:40,338 --> 00:53:43,466
Oh, my.
This is very interesting.

673
00:53:45,443 --> 00:53:50,244
say, do you think it would be possible
for me to maybe play one of these parts?

674
00:53:50,315 --> 00:53:52,783
Oh, you want to be an actress too.
Well, of course.

675
00:53:52,851 --> 00:53:56,617
You know, there`s, there`s a couple
of parts I can think of right now
that you might be perfect for.

676
00:53:56,688 --> 00:54:01,716
There`s, uh, the secretary in the
newspaper office, the file clerk, umm--

677
00:54:01,793 --> 00:54:05,729
Hmm. Those sound
kind of small.

678
00:54:05,797 --> 00:54:08,265
Here`s one that looks good.
Janet Lawton.

679
00:54:09,901 --> 00:54:13,803
- I`d sure like to play her.
-Janet Lawton.

680
00:54:13,872 --> 00:54:17,865
Yes.Janet Lawton is clearly
the part to play.

681
00:54:20,979 --> 00:54:23,038
Can`t you just see me
in the part?

682
00:54:29,521 --> 00:54:32,820
Yes. You`d be perfect.

683
00:54:35,126 --> 00:54:37,026
You bastard!

684
00:54:37,095 --> 00:54:41,293
You two-timing,
dress-wearing son of a bitch!

685
00:54:41,366 --> 00:54:43,596
Honey, it was the only way
I could get the movie made.

686
00:54:43,668 --> 00:54:45,135
Who do you think`s been
paying the rent, huh?

687
00:54:45,203 --> 00:54:47,433
Who`s been helping you
type your scripts...

688
00:54:47,505 --> 00:54:49,973
and do all your grunt work?

689
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:52,134
I am sorry.
What did you want me to say?

690
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:54,405
You were supposed
to say, ``No.

691
00:54:54,479 --> 00:54:58,540
I wrote that part for
my girlfriend Dolores!``

692
00:54:59,918 --> 00:55:04,184
snowball, there are plenty
of other parts.

693
00:55:04,256 --> 00:55:07,453
Like what?

694
00:55:07,525 --> 00:55:10,619
The secretary,
the file clerk--

695
00:55:10,695 --> 00:55:13,220
You asshole!

696
00:55:16,898 --> 00:55:19,992
This is gonna be Bela`s laboratory,
so it should be real impressive.

697
00:55:20,068 --> 00:55:21,558
Just like one of those
mad scientist movies.

698
00:55:21,636 --> 00:55:23,194
I want test tubes,
beakers...

699
00:55:23,271 --> 00:55:25,637
and one of those
electrical things that buzzes.

700
00:55:25,707 --> 00:55:28,175
- Oh, you mean a tesla coil?
- Fine, whatever.

701
00:55:28,243 --> 00:55:30,677
- Hop to it.
- Right, right.

702
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,180
- Eddie?
- Yes?

703
00:55:34,249 --> 00:55:36,217
Which dress
do you like better?

704
00:55:36,284 --> 00:55:38,252
Hmm, I don`t know.

705
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:42,984
say, Bill, which dress works better
for you: the red one or the green one?

706
00:55:43,058 --> 00:55:46,186
- Which one is the red one?
- What do you mean?

707
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:49,958
I mean, I can`t see
the difference. I`m color-blind.

708
00:55:50,031 --> 00:55:53,762
But I kinda like
the dark gray one.

709
00:55:53,835 --> 00:55:58,101
At Universal, we used to shoot
one or two scenes a day.

710
00:55:58,173 --> 00:56:03,042
But Eddie can knock off 20, 30.
He`s incredible!

711
00:56:03,111 --> 00:56:05,272
And action.

712
00:56:08,516 --> 00:56:13,351
Okay, you`re Dr. Eric Vornoff,
and you`re upset.

713
00:56:13,421 --> 00:56:18,051
You`ve worked very hard
on this experiment and you
don`t want to see it fail.

714
00:56:18,126 --> 00:56:21,584
N-No, you`re not that upset.
You want to keep moving.

715
00:56:21,663 --> 00:56:24,097
You want to go
through that door.

716
00:56:28,169 --> 00:56:33,505
And cut. Beautiful. Print it.
Let`s move immediately to
scene 52. Tor, are you in place?

717
00:56:33,575 --> 00:56:35,406
- Yeah.
- Great. Roll camera.

718
00:56:35,477 --> 00:56:37,911
- Rolling.
- slate.
- Cue rainstorm.

719
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:41,815
And action, Tor.

720
00:56:44,853 --> 00:56:47,947
Okay, you`re Lobo.

721
00:56:48,022 --> 00:56:49,990
You`re upset.

722
00:56:50,058 --> 00:56:53,789
You`ve worked very hard helping
Dr. Vornoff with this experiment.

723
00:56:53,862 --> 00:56:56,126
You don`t want
to see it fail.

724
00:56:56,197 --> 00:56:58,757
No, no, you`re not
that upset.

725
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:02,735
You want to keep moving. You`ve
got to get through that door.

726
00:57:08,777 --> 00:57:11,245
And cut. Perfect. Print it.
Let`s move on.

727
00:57:11,312 --> 00:57:13,405
Don`t you want to do another take, Ed?
Looks like big baldy...

728
00:57:13,481 --> 00:57:15,915
had a little trouble
gettin` through the door.

729
00:57:15,984 --> 00:57:17,975
No, it`s fine.
It`s real.

730
00:57:18,052 --> 00:57:22,546
You know, in actuality, Lobo would have
to struggle with that problem every day.

731
00:57:22,624 --> 00:57:26,526
All right, people, let`s get ready.
Actors, I must have my actors.

732
00:57:26,594 --> 00:57:29,620
There you are. Loretta, Tor,
I want to explain this scene to you.

733
00:57:29,697 --> 00:57:34,134
It`s a little complicated, but, uh--
Bela, you`ll be sitting there, okay?

734
00:57:34,202 --> 00:57:36,033
I`m not getting near
that goddamned thing.

735
00:57:36,104 --> 00:57:39,301
One of them burned me
in The Return of Chandu.

736
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:42,241
All right.
Then you`ll be sitting there.

737
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:44,175
- Good.
- Great.

738
00:57:44,245 --> 00:57:47,078
All right, gang, here`s the scene.
Loretta, you`re in a trance.

739
00:57:47,148 --> 00:57:50,914
You glide in and get on
the operating table. Now, Tor,
you`re supposed to tie her down...

740
00:57:50,985 --> 00:57:55,445
but you have an Angora fetish,
and when you rub that swatch
of Angora it makes you refuse.

741
00:57:55,523 --> 00:57:58,583
so then Bela has to
discipline you. All right?

742
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:01,390
- Great. Let`s do it!
- Okay.

743
00:58:02,464 --> 00:58:04,432
Action.

744
00:58:09,437 --> 00:58:11,962
strap her to the table.

745
00:58:14,142 --> 00:58:16,508
Do as I command you!

746
00:58:18,446 --> 00:58:21,904
I`ll teach you
to disobey me!

747
00:58:21,983 --> 00:58:24,315
You will obey!

748
00:58:24,385 --> 00:58:26,285
strap her in!

749
00:58:26,354 --> 00:58:29,380
strap her in!
I command you!

750
00:58:29,457 --> 00:58:32,187
- Wood! Your check bounced.
- Eh-Eh, fine. I`ll get you
the money later.

751
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:35,024
- I`ll teach you to disobey me!
- No, I need it now.

752
00:58:35,096 --> 00:58:38,122
Cut!

753
00:58:38,199 --> 00:58:40,997
I am terribly sorry to bother
you while you`re shooting...

754
00:58:41,069 --> 00:58:43,799
but the guy that owns the stage
needs his money.

755
00:58:43,872 --> 00:58:47,273
Well, then you should pay him,
shouldn`t you?

756
00:58:47,342 --> 00:58:49,833
Yes. Exactly.

757
00:58:55,617 --> 00:58:57,676
I kind of need it now.

758
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:04,118
What are you looking at me
like that for?

759
00:59:04,192 --> 00:59:07,525
I already gave you my 300.

760
00:59:07,595 --> 00:59:12,032
Right. And now I need
the other 60,000.

761
00:59:13,268 --> 00:59:16,795
What other 60,000?

762
00:59:16,871 --> 00:59:21,069
The other 60,000
you said you`d give to me.

763
00:59:21,142 --> 00:59:25,602
You misunderstood, Eddie. I gave you
everything I have in the world.

764
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,671
Three hundred dollars.

765
00:59:44,395 --> 00:59:46,556
Well, here we go again.

766
00:59:46,631 --> 00:59:48,599
Let me tell you,
ya can`t lose.

767
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:52,158
It`s scary. And if you don`t
like that, it`s romantic.

768
00:59:52,237 --> 00:59:55,206
Bela Lugosi will portray
Dr. Eric Vornoff.

769
01:00:01,146 --> 01:00:05,105
And lovely, lovely, lovely
ingenue Loretta King...

770
01:00:05,183 --> 01:00:08,050
is reporterJanet Lawton.

771
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:10,679
- I don`t know. Lugosi looks pretty old.
- Huh?

772
01:00:12,757 --> 01:00:15,123
Which role does
Vampira play?

773
01:00:15,193 --> 01:00:19,459
- Vampira? Why do you ask?
- she`s standing right over there.

774
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,634
Well, she plays--

775
01:00:27,172 --> 01:00:29,106
Excuse me one minute.

776
01:00:31,776 --> 01:00:33,971
- Pardon me, Miss Vampira?
- Yes?

777
01:00:34,045 --> 01:00:36,536
Uh, you don`t know me, but I`m
Ed Wood. I`m a film producer...

778
01:00:36,614 --> 01:00:38,809
and I`m currently in production
on a science-fiction piece...

779
01:00:38,883 --> 01:00:41,545
with Bela Lugosi and
swedish wrestler TorJohnson.

780
01:00:41,619 --> 01:00:43,814
I don`t understand.
Do you want my autograph?

781
01:00:45,256 --> 01:00:49,920
No. No, I, I think my film
is perfect for you.

782
01:00:49,994 --> 01:00:53,657
You want me to show it on my TV program?
Well, I have nothing to do with that.

783
01:00:53,731 --> 01:00:55,722
You should call the
station manager at Channel 7.

784
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,791
No, no. No, no. No, no.

785
01:00:57,869 --> 01:01:00,099
I don`t want you to show the
movie. I want you to be in it.

786
01:01:00,171 --> 01:01:03,698
Let me explain. We started shooting,
but after three days we got shut down.

787
01:01:03,775 --> 01:01:06,300
Now we`re having a backers
party to raise some more money.

788
01:01:06,377 --> 01:01:10,074
so I thought perhaps you`d like
to come over and just say howdy
to some of the backers.

789
01:01:10,148 --> 01:01:13,140
Look, I`m with some friends
and we`re about to eat.

790
01:01:13,218 --> 01:01:15,277
Please! It would
just take one second.

791
01:01:15,353 --> 01:01:19,153
Come on over and meet the backers! There
is a really nice dentist from Oxnard.

792
01:01:19,224 --> 01:01:21,818
Look, buddy, I`ve got real
offers from real studios.

793
01:01:21,893 --> 01:01:25,021
I don`t need to blow some
dentist for a part. Forget it.

794
01:01:27,065 --> 01:01:30,523
Miss Vampira! Please.

795
01:01:30,602 --> 01:01:32,866
Let`s go.

796
01:01:32,937 --> 01:01:36,805
I`m getting a bad feeling about
this. Let`s get outta here.

797
01:01:36,874 --> 01:01:38,739
Yeah, I think you`re right.

798
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:41,210
Thank you folks for coming
tonight, but we`d better go.

799
01:01:43,248 --> 01:01:46,740
And then, Dr. Vornoff
falls into the pit...

800
01:01:46,818 --> 01:01:50,254
and his own octopus
attacks and eats him.

801
01:01:50,321 --> 01:01:52,050
The End.

802
01:01:53,658 --> 01:01:55,785
- That`s quite a story.
- Yes.

803
01:01:56,961 --> 01:02:00,761
so, uh--
You made the movie...

804
01:02:00,832 --> 01:02:03,027
and now you wanna
make it again?

805
01:02:03,101 --> 01:02:08,164
No. We shot ten minutes of
the movie, and now we`re
looking for completion funds.

806
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:10,298
Oh, son,
you`re too vague.

807
01:02:12,644 --> 01:02:15,010
Billy Bob!

808
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:17,604
You`re cuttin` `em
too lean.

809
01:02:17,682 --> 01:02:19,673
Mr. McCoy?

810
01:02:21,486 --> 01:02:24,853
How can I make you happy?

811
01:02:24,922 --> 01:02:26,856
Okay.

812
01:02:26,924 --> 01:02:30,451
Two things. Number one...

813
01:02:30,528 --> 01:02:34,191
I want the movie to end
with a big explosion.

814
01:02:36,401 --> 01:02:40,030
sky full of smoke.

815
01:02:40,104 --> 01:02:44,837
Yes. But it ends with Dr.
Vornoff falling into the pit.

816
01:02:46,344 --> 01:02:50,007
Not anymore. Number two...

817
01:02:50,081 --> 01:02:52,049
I got a son...

818
01:02:52,116 --> 01:02:56,746
an` he`s a little slow,
but a good boy.

819
01:02:56,821 --> 01:03:00,621
And somethin` tells me he`d
make a hell of a leadin` man.

820
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:07,219
sounds perfect.

821
01:03:07,394 --> 01:03:09,021
This is unbelievable.

822
01:03:09,096 --> 01:03:11,792
I mean, I woulda bet a million bucks
that Ed wouldn`t finish this picture.

823
01:03:11,865 --> 01:03:14,891
Yeah, well, it ain`t finished yet, kid.
Anything can happen.

824
01:03:17,037 --> 01:03:20,939
-stay outta scratching distance.
-Oh, good, you made it. I wasn`t
sure you got my message.

825
01:03:21,008 --> 01:03:23,533
Well, of course I made it.
Today`s the file clerk`s big scene.

826
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:25,805
- Indeed. Uh-Uh, that`s right.
- staying away--

827
01:03:25,879 --> 01:03:30,145
- I see the usual gang of misfits
and dope addicts are here.
-Janet, I want you straight--

828
01:03:30,217 --> 01:03:34,347
- say, who`s the lug?
- str-- I want you staying away...

829
01:03:34,421 --> 01:03:36,286
from the old Willows place.

830
01:03:36,356 --> 01:03:39,723
Why, that`s Tony McCoy. He will
be portraying Lt. Dick Craig.

831
01:03:39,793 --> 01:03:41,954
Really? How much money
did he put up?

832
01:03:42,029 --> 01:03:44,361
None. But his dad
gave me 50 grand.

833
01:03:44,431 --> 01:03:47,366
- I want you staying--
- Hmm. Wood Productions,
the mark of quality.

834
01:03:47,434 --> 01:03:51,200
- I want you staying away--
- Listen, the movie`s getting made.
That`s all that matters.

835
01:03:52,272 --> 01:03:54,433
- Hello, Harry.
- Oh, hi, Dolores.

836
01:03:54,508 --> 01:03:59,343
Oh! You`re Dolores.
I`ve heard so much about you.

837
01:03:59,413 --> 01:04:02,177
I`m Loretta King.
Oh, here, take the chair.

838
01:04:02,249 --> 01:04:05,309
No, don`t be silly. Let Harry finish.
You still need some more work.

839
01:04:06,687 --> 01:04:10,384
No, I`m finished. All I
needed was a touch-up.

840
01:04:10,457 --> 01:04:12,254
Mm, that mole still shows.

841
01:04:12,326 --> 01:04:16,228
Ladies, you both look fine!

842
01:04:16,296 --> 01:04:18,628
Why don`t we talk about
the scene?

843
01:04:18,699 --> 01:04:23,136
Okay,Janet Lawton has just
discovered that Dr. Vornoff
bought the old Willows estate.

844
01:04:23,203 --> 01:04:25,603
so now she wants to prove
that all the monster stories are true.

845
01:04:25,672 --> 01:04:29,335
Well, Eddie,
what`s my motivation?

846
01:04:29,409 --> 01:04:33,470
You`re the file clerk.
You`re running into the next
room and you bump intoJanet.

847
01:04:33,547 --> 01:04:37,347
Well, what is our relationship?
Are we good friends, or is she
just a casual acquaintance?

848
01:04:37,417 --> 01:04:41,854
Dolores, I have five days
to complete this picture.

849
01:04:41,922 --> 01:04:43,947
Don`t get goofy on me.

850
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,494
Action.

851
01:04:50,597 --> 01:04:53,157
- Hi,Janet.
- Oh, hi, Marge.

852
01:04:53,233 --> 01:04:56,669
-Janet, still on the monster hunt?
- What do you think?

853
01:04:56,737 --> 01:04:59,171
I think the boss has been
looking for you all day.

854
01:04:59,239 --> 01:05:02,538
something about the police
wanting those monster stories 86`d.

855
01:05:02,609 --> 01:05:05,874
- You`ve got the whole town in a panic.
- I can`t hear you.

856
01:05:05,946 --> 01:05:10,747
- I said, you`ve got the whole--
- I know what you said,
but I can`t hear you.

857
01:05:10,817 --> 01:05:12,876
I get it. see ya later.

858
01:05:14,922 --> 01:05:19,552
And cut! That was perfect.

859
01:05:19,626 --> 01:05:22,618
- Of course it was.
- Bravo!

860
01:05:22,696 --> 01:05:26,689
- Bravo! Magnifico.!
- Cris, you made it. Thanks a lot.

861
01:05:26,767 --> 01:05:30,225
Naturally! Always happy to help
with a little larceny.

862
01:05:30,304 --> 01:05:33,705
All right, everybody, that`s
it for today. The prop crew
has a little errand to run.

863
01:05:33,774 --> 01:05:35,708
Paul, Connie.

864
01:05:49,122 --> 01:05:51,920
Darn, I thought
they kept this open.

865
01:05:51,992 --> 01:05:53,926
Lobo will fix!

866
01:05:59,933 --> 01:06:02,561
Good boy.

867
01:06:03,737 --> 01:06:06,501
-Wow!
-This place gives me the creeps.
Let`s get the hell outta here.

868
01:06:06,573 --> 01:06:09,565
Not so fast.
Not till we get it down.

869
01:06:09,643 --> 01:06:11,975
There it is.
Paul, go unhook it.

870
01:06:12,045 --> 01:06:13,979
Right.

871
01:06:16,783 --> 01:06:19,684
Fantastic. It`s beautiful.

872
01:06:21,154 --> 01:06:23,088
- You sure this is gonna work?
- Yes.

873
01:06:25,425 --> 01:06:28,019
- You sure?
- Yes, hurry, do it.

874
01:06:39,539 --> 01:06:41,700
My God!

875
01:06:43,944 --> 01:06:45,878
We killed him!

876
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,917
Tor?

877
01:06:54,021 --> 01:06:56,080
Better than wrestling.

878
01:06:56,156 --> 01:07:00,923
- Lights!
- Now,Janet, I want you stayin` away...

879
01:07:00,994 --> 01:07:02,461
from that old
Willows place.

880
01:07:02,529 --> 01:07:06,192
I want-- Now,Janet, I--

881
01:07:06,266 --> 01:07:08,359
- I want you--
- Great.

882
01:07:08,435 --> 01:07:12,303
- Connie. Connie, the octopus
has to live in a lake.
- I want you stayin` away--

883
01:07:12,372 --> 01:07:15,705
- This is kind of a stream.
- No, it has to be underwater!

884
01:07:20,047 --> 01:07:22,607
Go set up by the lake.

885
01:07:22,683 --> 01:07:25,413
Eddie, I`m so tired.

886
01:07:25,485 --> 01:07:28,045
I-I don`t know if I can
handle a night shoot.

887
01:07:28,121 --> 01:07:30,180
Nonsense. You look great.

888
01:07:32,926 --> 01:07:35,656
All right, look, uh--
Why don`t you have a nice nap...

889
01:07:35,729 --> 01:07:38,163
and we`ll shoot around you
for a little while.

890
01:07:38,231 --> 01:07:41,098
- Thanks, buddy.
- You`re welcome.

891
01:07:41,168 --> 01:07:43,102
All right, you kids.

892
01:07:58,919 --> 01:08:01,285
Hey, this is
looking fantastic.

893
01:08:02,355 --> 01:08:04,789
Paul, where`s
the octopus motor?

894
01:08:06,193 --> 01:08:09,219
- What octopus motor?
- To make his legs move.

895
01:08:12,232 --> 01:08:15,793
Well, don`t blame me!
You didn`t say anything about
a motor when I was on the ceiling!

896
01:08:19,206 --> 01:08:21,140
What`s he talking--

897
01:08:25,345 --> 01:08:27,643
Paul lost the octopus motor.

898
01:08:29,182 --> 01:08:31,514
All right,
let`s shoot this fucker!

899
01:08:31,585 --> 01:08:32,916
Great!

900
01:08:35,088 --> 01:08:38,182
- Where do I go?
- You`ll be fighting with the octopus.

901
01:08:38,258 --> 01:08:41,022
- Out there?
- Yes.

902
01:08:41,094 --> 01:08:43,392
What happened
to the stream?

903
01:08:43,463 --> 01:08:45,693
Well, this is gonna look a lot
better. We have to match it...

904
01:08:45,766 --> 01:08:49,167
to the stock footage
of the octopus underwater.

905
01:08:50,237 --> 01:08:52,171
Ah, for Christ`s sake.

906
01:08:56,576 --> 01:08:59,943
- Goddamn, it`s cold!
- It`ll warm up once you`re in it.

907
01:09:00,013 --> 01:09:02,538
Fuck you!
You come out here!

908
01:09:02,616 --> 01:09:05,050
Hey! Throw me that whiskey.

909
01:09:15,462 --> 01:09:18,659
How do you turn this on?

910
01:09:18,732 --> 01:09:22,930
Well, somebody misplaced
the octopus motor.

911
01:09:23,003 --> 01:09:25,801
so when you get in there and fight
with him, shake his legs around.

912
01:09:25,872 --> 01:09:28,363
Looks like he`s killin` ya.
Okay.

913
01:09:30,644 --> 01:09:33,613
You know, I turned down
Frankenstein.

914
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,238
What?

915
01:09:35,315 --> 01:09:39,376
After I did Dracula, the studio
offered me Frankenstein...

916
01:09:39,452 --> 01:09:41,886
but I turned it down.

917
01:09:41,955 --> 01:09:44,890
Part wasn`t sexy enough.

918
01:09:44,958 --> 01:09:48,416
Too degrading for
a big star like me.

919
01:09:49,830 --> 01:09:54,927
Bela, I have 25 scenes
to shoot tonight.

920
01:09:55,001 --> 01:09:57,697
Oh. sorry.
Don`t let me slow you down.

921
01:09:58,605 --> 01:10:01,768
Okay. All right?

922
01:10:01,842 --> 01:10:03,776
Good.

923
01:10:05,879 --> 01:10:09,371
All right, let`s put it
on film. Camera!

924
01:10:09,449 --> 01:10:11,474
- Rolling.
- sound!

925
01:10:11,551 --> 01:10:14,816
- Ed, we don`t have sound.
- Oh.

926
01:10:14,888 --> 01:10:17,186
And action!

927
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:42,114
And cut!

928
01:10:45,118 --> 01:10:46,517
That was perfect.

929
01:10:46,653 --> 01:10:48,211
Come on!

930
01:10:48,288 --> 01:10:50,279
Come on, troops,
have a nice cup o`joe.

931
01:10:50,356 --> 01:10:54,156
You`ll feel much better.
All right, all right, Harry.

932
01:10:54,227 --> 01:10:56,957
- Mr. Wood?
- Huh?
- I only got one hour
of sleep last night.

933
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:59,521
Yeah, well, I got no sleep,
and I feel great.

934
01:10:59,599 --> 01:11:01,794
Go get `em, kid.
Go get `em.

935
01:11:01,868 --> 01:11:04,098
- I`m gettin` too old for this.
- Great work, Bill.

936
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:06,161
Go ahead. Go get `em.

937
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,833
Be careful. Don`t hurt him.

938
01:11:08,908 --> 01:11:11,069
Don`t scratch
the tentacles.

939
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:18,674
Bela, I wanna thank you again
for last night.

940
01:11:18,751 --> 01:11:21,481
That`s fine, Eddie.
All in the line of duty.

941
01:11:21,554 --> 01:11:26,651
No, no, I want you to know how much
I appreciate all you`ve done for me.

942
01:11:26,726 --> 01:11:30,753
Great man like yourself
shouldn`t have be wandering
though the muck at 4:00 a.m.

943
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:34,027
Well, there are not a lot
of fellas I`d do it for.

944
01:11:36,135 --> 01:11:39,263
say, I wrote somethin`
special for ya.

945
01:11:39,339 --> 01:11:43,537
I got to thinkin` about all the
sacrifices you`ve made, and I--

946
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:47,102
Well, I wrote you a--

947
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:48,977
a new final speech.

948
01:11:51,651 --> 01:11:55,280
Well, this is quite
a scene, Eddie.

949
01:11:55,355 --> 01:11:58,051
I know it`s a lot to give you
at the last minute, Bela, but--

950
01:11:58,124 --> 01:12:02,527
These lines, I`ll have
no problem remembering.

951
01:12:04,697 --> 01:12:06,631
Great.

952
01:12:07,967 --> 01:12:11,403
All right, kids.
Let`s knock `em dead.

953
01:12:11,471 --> 01:12:15,339
My dear Professor strowski...

954
01:12:15,408 --> 01:12:20,277
20 years ago I was banned
from my homeland.

955
01:12:20,346 --> 01:12:24,407
I was classed as a madman,
a charlatan.

956
01:12:24,484 --> 01:12:31,048
Outlawed in the world of science which
previously honored me as a genius.

957
01:12:32,558 --> 01:12:34,890
Now here, in this...

958
01:12:34,961 --> 01:12:39,227
forsaken jungle hell...

959
01:12:39,298 --> 01:12:41,562
I have proven
that I am all right!

960
01:12:41,634 --> 01:12:44,398
Yes! The authorities
have learned...

961
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:47,405
how correct
your findings were.

962
01:12:47,473 --> 01:12:51,671
so I am here
to bring you home.

963
01:12:57,684 --> 01:12:59,618
Home?

964
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:03,079
I have no home.

965
01:13:04,524 --> 01:13:09,052
Hunted. Despised.

966
01:13:09,128 --> 01:13:11,460
Living like an animal.

967
01:13:11,531 --> 01:13:15,194
The jungle is my home.

968
01:13:15,268 --> 01:13:18,066
But I shall show the world...

969
01:13:18,137 --> 01:13:21,402
that I can be its master!

970
01:13:21,474 --> 01:13:25,774
I shall perfect
my own race of people...

971
01:13:25,845 --> 01:13:28,177
a race of atomic supermen...

972
01:13:28,247 --> 01:13:31,273
that will conquer
the world!

973
01:13:39,425 --> 01:13:44,294
Cut. That`s a wrap.

974
01:13:53,236 --> 01:13:55,136
Glen or Glenda?
Now, that was a hell of a picture.

975
01:13:55,204 --> 01:13:58,173
Yeah, but this new one is gonna
be a million times better.

976
01:13:58,241 --> 01:14:00,675
Is that possible?

977
01:14:05,548 --> 01:14:09,348
Mr. Bunny, what`s wrong?
I heard you were becoming a lady.

978
01:14:11,387 --> 01:14:13,321
Oh, that.

979
01:14:14,757 --> 01:14:17,885
Mexico was...

980
01:14:19,128 --> 01:14:21,062
a nightmare.

981
01:14:22,331 --> 01:14:24,891
We got in a car accident.

982
01:14:24,967 --> 01:14:27,197
He was killed.

983
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:30,433
Our luggage was stolen.

984
01:14:31,674 --> 01:14:36,338
The surgeon turned out
to be a quack.

985
01:14:36,412 --> 01:14:38,846
If it hadn`t been
for these men...

986
01:14:42,185 --> 01:14:43,914
I don`t know...

987
01:14:43,986 --> 01:14:48,184
how I would`ve survived.

988
01:16:15,678 --> 01:16:17,509
You people are insane!

989
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,571
You`re wasting your lives
making shit!

990
01:16:19,649 --> 01:16:22,743
Nobody cares!
These movies are terrible!

991
01:16:30,593 --> 01:16:32,527
Dolores!

992
01:16:36,532 --> 01:16:39,501
Ed, it`s over.
I need a normal life.

993
01:16:41,637 --> 01:16:45,403
- Did you really mean
those things you sa--
- I`m tired of living like this.

994
01:16:45,474 --> 01:16:48,534
- But, Poodle--
- I just stuck it out so you
could finish your movie.

995
01:16:48,611 --> 01:16:51,478
And now that it`s done,
so am I.

996
01:17:03,189 --> 01:17:06,386
Ooh, that was so scary
it gave me goose bumps.

997
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:10,986
No, dummy, I didn`t say "goose, `"
I said "goose bumps. `"

998
01:17:12,632 --> 01:17:16,329
Well, be sure to join me next
week for The Mummy`s Curse.

999
01:17:16,402 --> 01:17:19,599
Until then,
pleasant nightmares.

1000
01:17:32,184 --> 01:17:33,708
Okay, folks,
we`re off the air.

1001
01:17:33,786 --> 01:17:35,879
- That was a good show.
- I wish I would`ve--

1002
01:17:35,955 --> 01:17:39,686
- God, this show needs better jokes.
- You got a phone call.

1003
01:17:39,759 --> 01:17:41,693
- Who is it?
- I don`t know.

1004
01:17:43,596 --> 01:17:47,362
- Hello?
- Vampira? Ed Wood here.

1005
01:17:47,433 --> 01:17:51,028
- Who?
- Ed Wood. Remember,
I met you at the Brown Derby?

1006
01:17:51,103 --> 01:17:53,435
- Oh, yeah, you.
- Uh-Uh, listen, I was wondering...

1007
01:17:53,506 --> 01:17:55,736
if you`d like to go out sometime,
grab some dinner, maybe.

1008
01:17:55,808 --> 01:17:57,901
You mean a date?
I thought you were a fag.

1009
01:17:57,977 --> 01:18:02,107
No, no, I`m just a transvestite.
so, how`s about Friday night?

1010
01:18:02,181 --> 01:18:05,241
Look, you seem like a nice guy,
Ed, but you`re just not my type.

1011
01:18:05,318 --> 01:18:08,412
But keep in touch. Let me know
when your movie opens.

1012
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:21,027
- Hello?
- Eddie, help me.

1013
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:23,034
Bela?

1014
01:18:39,585 --> 01:18:41,519
Bela?

1015
01:18:43,589 --> 01:18:45,523
Bela!

1016
01:18:49,128 --> 01:18:51,062
What do you want?

1017
01:18:52,798 --> 01:18:55,164
You called me, remember?

1018
01:18:58,237 --> 01:19:00,000
What are you doing, Bela?

1019
01:19:00,072 --> 01:19:02,597
I`m going to kill myself.

1020
01:19:02,675 --> 01:19:04,973
My gosh, what happened?

1021
01:19:06,579 --> 01:19:08,877
Why-- Eddie.

1022
01:19:12,385 --> 01:19:16,219
I got a letter
from the government.

1023
01:19:16,288 --> 01:19:19,883
They`re cancelling my unemployment.

1024
01:19:21,227 --> 01:19:23,718
It`s all I`ve got.

1025
01:19:23,796 --> 01:19:26,890
Without it,
I can`t pay the rent.

1026
01:19:27,967 --> 01:19:30,162
Don`t you have any savings?

1027
01:19:30,236 --> 01:19:33,103
Eddie, I`m obsolete.

1028
01:19:34,407 --> 01:19:37,740
I have nothing to live for.

1029
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:40,608
Tonight, I shall die.

1030
01:19:46,352 --> 01:19:47,751
Eddie!

1031
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:50,653
You should come with me.

1032
01:19:50,723 --> 01:19:52,782
I don`t think that`s
such a good idea.

1033
01:19:52,858 --> 01:19:56,658
It`s a wonderful idea!
It`ll be wonderful!

1034
01:19:56,729 --> 01:20:00,961
We`ll be at peace.
In the afterlife, you don`t have
to worry about finding work.

1035
01:20:01,033 --> 01:20:03,433
Bela...

1036
01:20:03,502 --> 01:20:06,903
I`m on your side.

1037
01:20:06,972 --> 01:20:08,906
Gimme the gun.

1038
01:20:10,743 --> 01:20:14,474
If you give me the gun,
I`ll make you a drink.

1039
01:20:16,115 --> 01:20:18,606
What are you drinking, Bela?

1040
01:20:18,684 --> 01:20:21,175
Formaldehyde.

1041
01:20:21,253 --> 01:20:23,721
straight up
or on the rocks?

1042
01:20:37,937 --> 01:20:40,599
Eddie, I`m sorry.

1043
01:20:43,676 --> 01:20:47,737
- I`m so sorry.
- Don`t worry, Bela.

1044
01:20:47,813 --> 01:20:50,839
- I`m sorry, Eddie.
- Everything will be okay.

1045
01:21:01,026 --> 01:21:05,122
Oh, my goodness, you gave me the
willies. You look like that Dracula guy.

1046
01:21:06,432 --> 01:21:09,595
My name is Bela Lugosi...

1047
01:21:09,668 --> 01:21:11,795
and I wish to
commit myself.

1048
01:21:13,506 --> 01:21:16,134
For what reason?

1049
01:21:16,208 --> 01:21:20,440
I have been a drug addict
for 20 years.

1050
01:21:20,513 --> 01:21:22,538
I need help.

1051
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:11,020
Is that Angora?

1052
01:22:11,096 --> 01:22:13,030
Um, yes.

1053
01:22:15,334 --> 01:22:18,735
Don`t you think Angora
has a tactile sensuality...

1054
01:22:18,804 --> 01:22:21,102
lacking in all
other clothing?

1055
01:22:21,173 --> 01:22:23,107
Uh, I suppose.

1056
01:22:23,175 --> 01:22:25,473
It is awfully expensive.

1057
01:22:25,544 --> 01:22:30,948
Well, it`s made from specially-bred
rabbits that live in the Himalayas.

1058
01:22:31,016 --> 01:22:34,452
say, what are you,
an Angora wholesaler?

1059
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,044
No.

1060
01:22:37,122 --> 01:22:39,056
No.

1061
01:22:42,161 --> 01:22:45,562
I`m in pictures.

1062
01:22:45,631 --> 01:22:50,227
I`m a director, writer,
actor and producer.

1063
01:22:50,302 --> 01:22:52,361
Aw, come on.
Nobody does all that.

1064
01:22:52,438 --> 01:22:56,670
Oh, yes they do. Two people:
Orson Welles and me.

1065
01:22:56,742 --> 01:22:58,767
Wow.

1066
01:22:58,844 --> 01:23:02,245
- Whatcha makin`?
- Booties for my father.

1067
01:23:02,314 --> 01:23:06,580
- Gets cold in the hospital.
- Mm. Has he been here long?

1068
01:23:06,652 --> 01:23:08,711
This is my 1 3th pair.

1069
01:23:11,123 --> 01:23:12,988
Excuse me.

1070
01:23:14,894 --> 01:23:18,660
Excuse me, Doctor,
I`m with Mr. Lugosi. How is he?

1071
01:23:18,731 --> 01:23:21,894
Well, there`s a lot of junk in
his system for such an old man.

1072
01:23:21,967 --> 01:23:24,800
Apparently,
he was addicted to morphine,
and then he tried to kick that...

1073
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:27,498
and he got readdicted
to methadone.

1074
01:23:27,573 --> 01:23:30,474
- Is he gonna be okay?
- We`ll do our best.

1075
01:23:35,281 --> 01:23:38,614
- Yes.
- Hi, Lillian.
- Oh, hi, Ed. He`s got
a lot of visitors today.

1076
01:23:38,684 --> 01:23:42,450
- He does?
- Mm-hmm.
- smile. That`s it. Thank you.

1077
01:23:42,521 --> 01:23:45,820
- Hey! Hey!
- One more picture, sir? Thank you.

1078
01:23:45,891 --> 01:23:49,122
- Do the doctors say you`re
gonna get outta here?
- Freaks! Get outta here!

1079
01:23:49,194 --> 01:23:52,425
- Get outta here!
What is wrong with you people?
- Hey! Come on.

1080
01:23:52,498 --> 01:23:55,524
Trash barrel!

1081
01:23:55,601 --> 01:23:59,867
- Bela, what happened?
- Eddie, why did you chase them?

1082
01:23:59,939 --> 01:24:05,070
After all these years, the press is
finally interested again in Bela Lugosi.

1083
01:24:05,144 --> 01:24:10,104
Bela, those people are parasites.
They just want to exploit you.

1084
01:24:10,182 --> 01:24:13,674
Fine. Let them.

1085
01:24:13,752 --> 01:24:16,949
There is no such thing
as bad press, Eddie.

1086
01:24:17,022 --> 01:24:20,856
Man from New York even said he`s
putting me on the front page!

1087
01:24:22,361 --> 01:24:25,023
First celebrity ever
to check into rehab.

1088
01:24:28,067 --> 01:24:31,161
When I get out of here...

1089
01:24:31,236 --> 01:24:35,297
I will be healthy, strong...

1090
01:24:35,374 --> 01:24:38,309
primed for my comeback.

1091
01:24:50,475 --> 01:24:53,035
- Hello again.
- Hi.

1092
01:24:53,111 --> 01:24:57,343
- You look beat.
- No, I-I`m fine. How`s your father?

1093
01:24:57,416 --> 01:25:00,681
Better. Thank you for asking.
And your friend?

1094
01:25:03,555 --> 01:25:06,786
Not good.

1095
01:25:06,858 --> 01:25:10,419
Well, I made him some booties
to cheer him up.

1096
01:25:12,464 --> 01:25:15,433
They`re black,
to match his cape.

1097
01:25:20,038 --> 01:25:23,235
- say, have you always
lived in Los Angeles?
- No. I`m from back east.

1098
01:25:23,308 --> 01:25:27,142
Poughkeepsie. You know,
all-American small town.

1099
01:25:27,212 --> 01:25:31,376
Everybody knows everybody. My dad worked
for the post office. I was a Boy scout.

1100
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:34,351
- Did you find it boring?
- No. Not at all.

1101
01:25:34,419 --> 01:25:36,910
I had my comic books
and pulp magazines.

1102
01:25:36,989 --> 01:25:38,923
Used to listen to the
radio dramas constantly.

1103
01:25:38,991 --> 01:25:42,290
- I love those shows.
The Shadow, Inner Sanctum.
- Yes.

1104
01:25:42,361 --> 01:25:45,228
- And the Mercury Theatre
with Orson Welles.
- Mmm.

1105
01:25:45,297 --> 01:25:48,323
Boy, you know, every saturday
afternoon me and my dad...

1106
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:51,267
marched down the street in our uniform
to the little movie theater.

1107
01:25:51,336 --> 01:25:53,531
Ah! Oh, the spook house!

1108
01:26:29,741 --> 01:26:31,936
You`re not going to believe
the first picture I ever saw.

1109
01:26:32,010 --> 01:26:34,376
It was your friend`s.
Dracula.

1110
01:26:34,446 --> 01:26:36,676
Oh, that`s incredible. That`s
the first picture I ever saw.

1111
01:26:36,748 --> 01:26:40,479
That is incredible. You know, I had
to sleep with the lights on for a week.

1112
01:26:40,552 --> 01:26:42,281
I had to sleep with
the lights on for a month...

1113
01:26:42,354 --> 01:26:44,948
but I never missed a Lugosi
picture after that one.

1114
01:26:46,658 --> 01:26:49,525
A few years ago, I actually
saw him do Dracula live.

1115
01:26:49,594 --> 01:26:52,358
It was much scarier
in person.

1116
01:26:54,266 --> 01:26:56,700
Oh. We`re stuck.

1117
01:27:04,643 --> 01:27:07,806
Kathy...

1118
01:27:07,879 --> 01:27:11,474
I`m about to tell you something that
I never told any girl on a first date.

1119
01:27:13,418 --> 01:27:15,886
But I think it`s important
that you know...

1120
01:27:22,928 --> 01:27:24,919
I like to wear women`s clothes.

1121
01:27:27,933 --> 01:27:30,902
-Huh?
-I like to wear women`s clothes.

1122
01:27:32,137 --> 01:27:35,971
Panties, brassieres,
sweaters, pumps.

1123
01:27:36,041 --> 01:27:39,477
It`s just something I do.

1124
01:27:39,544 --> 01:27:41,808
And I can`t believe I`m telling
you this, but I really like you...

1125
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:44,212
and I don`t want it getting
in the way down the road.

1126
01:27:46,451 --> 01:27:51,388
Does this mean you don`t
like sex with girls?

1127
01:27:51,456 --> 01:27:54,425
No, I love sex with girls.

1128
01:27:59,831 --> 01:28:01,765
Okay.

1129
01:28:03,468 --> 01:28:05,402
Okay?

1130
01:28:07,005 --> 01:28:08,939
Okay.

1131
01:28:19,841 --> 01:28:24,278
You see, we thought that Mr. Lugosi
was insured through his union.

1132
01:28:24,346 --> 01:28:28,840
- Isn`t he?
- No. They say that his
eligibility ran out years ago.

1133
01:28:31,987 --> 01:28:34,888
Look, Doctor.

1134
01:28:34,956 --> 01:28:38,619
He doesn`t have any money,
but I`ll give you everything I`ve got.

1135
01:28:38,693 --> 01:28:42,026
- I have a few hundred dollars.
- That won`t even begin to cover it.

1136
01:28:42,097 --> 01:28:44,725
He`s gonna have to leave.

1137
01:28:48,970 --> 01:28:51,666
Bela? Bela.

1138
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:53,867
Wake up.

1139
01:28:53,942 --> 01:28:56,069
I`ve got some great news.

1140
01:28:56,144 --> 01:28:58,738
The doctor says you`re all better
and you can go home now.

1141
01:29:00,448 --> 01:29:02,882
Really?

1142
01:29:02,951 --> 01:29:04,885
I don`t feel so great.

1143
01:29:04,953 --> 01:29:08,650
No? Well, you look
just peachy.

1144
01:29:08,723 --> 01:29:11,556
And the-- the tests
came back fine.

1145
01:29:11,626 --> 01:29:15,756
Come on. Let`s get up.

1146
01:29:15,830 --> 01:29:17,764
Here we go.

1147
01:29:17,832 --> 01:29:21,063
Attaboy. Good.

1148
01:29:28,610 --> 01:29:30,544
Eddie...

1149
01:29:30,612 --> 01:29:33,581
I want to make another picture.

1150
01:29:33,648 --> 01:29:36,549
When are we going to make
another picture?

1151
01:29:36,618 --> 01:29:39,143
Oh, soon, Bela.

1152
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:41,154
Very soon.

1153
01:29:48,163 --> 01:29:51,098
This is so exciting.

1154
01:29:51,166 --> 01:29:53,100
Another production.

1155
01:29:53,168 --> 01:29:55,329
Isn`t it?

1156
01:29:55,403 --> 01:29:59,169
so, Eddie, shouldn`t we
have a sound crew?

1157
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:02,073
Uh, no, no. Because this
is just second unit stuff.

1158
01:30:02,143 --> 01:30:04,771
We`re going to do the main
footage later. All right?

1159
01:30:05,947 --> 01:30:07,778
so what`s the scene about?

1160
01:30:08,850 --> 01:30:10,977
Um.

1161
01:30:11,052 --> 01:30:13,418
You`re a very important
and respected man.

1162
01:30:13,488 --> 01:30:15,615
And you`re leaving your house.
You`re-- You`re in a hurry.

1163
01:30:15,690 --> 01:30:19,524
You`re on your way to a big
social brouhaha. Okay?

1164
01:30:19,594 --> 01:30:23,621
Eddie, what if I`m not
in so big a hurry?

1165
01:30:23,698 --> 01:30:26,792
What if I take a moment
to slow down...

1166
01:30:26,868 --> 01:30:28,802
to savor the beauty of life...

1167
01:30:28,870 --> 01:30:32,806
to-- to smell a budding flower?

1168
01:30:32,874 --> 01:30:36,071
That`s great. That is great.

1169
01:30:36,144 --> 01:30:38,374
Let`s do a take. Okay?

1170
01:30:41,074 --> 01:30:44,271
Ed, I`m really busy.
What do you want now?

1171
01:30:44,344 --> 01:30:46,642
Listen, I was calling to see if you`d
like to attend the world premiere...

1172
01:30:46,713 --> 01:30:49,011
of my new movie,
Bride of the Monster.

1173
01:30:49,082 --> 01:30:51,448
Didn`t you just make one
called Bride of the Atom?

1174
01:30:51,518 --> 01:30:54,385
Yes, it`s the same film, but the
distributor wanted a punchier title.

1175
01:30:54,454 --> 01:30:59,050
Come on, it`s gonna be
a big event. Bela, Tor and Cris
are coming. You`ll have fun.

1176
01:31:01,728 --> 01:31:05,824
I can`t see. These contact
lenses are hurting.

1177
01:31:05,899 --> 01:31:09,630
- My eyes are killing me.
- Don`t worry. We`re almost there.

1178
01:31:16,910 --> 01:31:20,107
Hi. Right in there.

1179
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:22,580
Thank God you`re here.
They`re tearing up the place.

1180
01:31:24,083 --> 01:31:26,347
Come on. Come on!

1181
01:31:26,419 --> 01:31:28,353
Come on. This way.

1182
01:31:31,024 --> 01:31:34,221
Come on! Come on!

1183
01:31:34,294 --> 01:31:37,161
I`ve never been
to a movie premiere before.

1184
01:31:48,641 --> 01:31:50,734
Well, go knock `em dead.

1185
01:32:05,625 --> 01:32:08,594
At the stroke of midnight...

1186
01:32:08,661 --> 01:32:10,652
the witching hour...

1187
01:32:10,730 --> 01:32:13,494
the ghouls arise...

1188
01:32:13,566 --> 01:32:15,500
from the dead.

1189
01:32:22,842 --> 01:32:26,278
- Hey, Vampira, how `bout a little love?
- Fuck off.

1190
01:32:26,346 --> 01:32:28,712
One of them stole my wallet!

1191
01:32:34,354 --> 01:32:37,482
- I can`t see!
- Get `em off me!
- Come on. Let`s go!

1192
01:32:37,557 --> 01:32:39,752
I gotta save `em.

1193
01:32:41,194 --> 01:32:43,287
Get your heads down.
Come on. Let`s go!

1194
01:32:43,363 --> 01:32:45,558
- We`re gettin` the heck outta here!
- Okay, let`s go.

1195
01:32:45,632 --> 01:32:48,157
I can`t see!

1196
01:32:48,234 --> 01:32:50,202
I can`t see!

1197
01:32:55,208 --> 01:32:58,143
Hey, come on. Let`s split!

1198
01:33:06,286 --> 01:33:08,982
Taxi!

1199
01:33:09,055 --> 01:33:13,253
- stop!
- Get in! Get in! Aw, go on! Get in!

1200
01:33:22,101 --> 01:33:24,160
Now, that was a premiere.

1201
01:33:33,246 --> 01:33:35,180
Eddie...

1202
01:33:35,248 --> 01:33:37,910
last night was quite a romp.

1203
01:33:37,984 --> 01:33:40,418
Did you see that kid grab
Vampira`s boobies?

1204
01:33:40,486 --> 01:33:44,388
I envied him.
Hell, I envied you too.

1205
01:33:44,457 --> 01:33:49,053
A girlfriend who would jump
in front of a car like that.

1206
01:33:49,128 --> 01:33:51,858
Yes, she is quite something.

1207
01:33:51,931 --> 01:33:54,195
None of my wives would have.

1208
01:33:57,770 --> 01:33:59,863
Eddie...

1209
01:33:59,939 --> 01:34:02,373
I want to thank you.

1210
01:34:02,442 --> 01:34:05,377
These last few days
have been...

1211
01:34:05,445 --> 01:34:08,676
a good time.

1212
01:34:08,748 --> 01:34:12,445
You know, I just-- I just wish
you coulda seen the movie.

1213
01:34:12,518 --> 01:34:15,954
Ahh. No problem.

1214
01:34:16,022 --> 01:34:18,217
I know it by heart.

1215
01:34:25,131 --> 01:34:27,929
Home.

1216
01:34:28,001 --> 01:34:29,935
I have no home.

1217
01:34:31,637 --> 01:34:33,730
Hunted...

1218
01:34:33,806 --> 01:34:36,206
despised...

1219
01:34:36,275 --> 01:34:38,835
living like an animal.

1220
01:34:38,911 --> 01:34:42,039
The jungle is my home.

1221
01:34:42,115 --> 01:34:47,382
But I shall show the world
that I can be its master!

1222
01:34:47,453 --> 01:34:51,184
I shall perfect
my own race of people...

1223
01:34:51,257 --> 01:34:53,851
a race of atomic supermen...

1224
01:34:53,926 --> 01:34:57,327
that will conquer the world!

1225
01:35:00,133 --> 01:35:03,330
Uh, M-M-Mr. Lugosi, could I
have your autograph, please?

1226
01:35:03,403 --> 01:35:06,270
- Certainly.
- Why, that was-- that was incredible.

1227
01:35:06,339 --> 01:35:10,207
- I mean, you`re just
as great as you ever were.
- Better.

1228
01:35:10,276 --> 01:35:13,439
I`m 7 4, but I don`t know it.

1229
01:35:13,513 --> 01:35:19,042
When the brain is young,
the spirit is still vigorous...

1230
01:35:19,118 --> 01:35:22,281
like-- like a young man.

1231
01:35:24,218 --> 01:35:26,379
``And left the planet Mars...

1232
01:35:26,454 --> 01:35:29,480
never to return again.``

1233
01:35:29,557 --> 01:35:31,650
- The end.
- Mmm.

1234
01:35:35,863 --> 01:35:37,797
Wood Productions.

1235
01:36:34,989 --> 01:36:37,480
Hey, whose crazy idea was it
to bury him in the cape?

1236
01:36:37,558 --> 01:36:39,549
I heard it was in the will.

1237
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:43,529
It was how he wanted
to be remembered.

1238
01:37:17,498 --> 01:37:19,432
Could you run it again?

1239
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:34,808
- Mr. Wood?
- Huh?

1240
01:37:34,882 --> 01:37:37,817
Uh, Mr. Wood, this is
Mr. Reynolds, your landlord.

1241
01:37:37,885 --> 01:37:40,581
Could you please open up?

1242
01:37:40,655 --> 01:37:42,589
One minute.

1243
01:37:44,158 --> 01:37:46,649
- Yes?
- Uh, Mr. Wood, you have bounced...

1244
01:37:46,727 --> 01:37:50,720
your third and final rent check.

1245
01:37:50,798 --> 01:37:54,325
I`m terribly sorry. My-my-my-my
stockbroker must have
transferred the wrong account.

1246
01:37:54,402 --> 01:37:56,495
Come on in.
I`ll write you another check.

1247
01:38:01,242 --> 01:38:04,040
Ohh, I see you`re in
the picture business.

1248
01:38:04,111 --> 01:38:08,309
-Yes.
-I`m interested in the picture business.

1249
01:38:08,382 --> 01:38:10,680
My associates and I,
we wish to produce...

1250
01:38:10,751 --> 01:38:13,151
a series of uplifting
religious films...

1251
01:38:13,221 --> 01:38:15,155
about the apostles.

1252
01:38:15,223 --> 01:38:18,215
But unfortunately
we don`t have enough money.

1253
01:38:18,292 --> 01:38:20,760
Oh. Raising money`s tough.

1254
01:38:20,828 --> 01:38:23,160
No, our church has enough money
for one film.

1255
01:38:23,231 --> 01:38:25,699
We just don`t have enough
for all twelve.

1256
01:38:28,236 --> 01:38:30,636
Well, you know what you do?

1257
01:38:30,705 --> 01:38:33,503
You produce a film in
a commercially-proven genre...

1258
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:37,704
and then after it`s a hit, you
take the profits from that and
you make the 1 2 apostles movie.

1259
01:38:37,778 --> 01:38:39,973
- Would that work?
- Absolutely.

1260
01:38:40,047 --> 01:38:42,038
Let me show you something.

1261
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:48,017
You see this script?
Grave Robbers from Outer Space.

1262
01:38:48,089 --> 01:38:50,284
Money in the bank.

1263
01:38:50,358 --> 01:38:52,417
Grave robbers from what?

1264
01:38:52,493 --> 01:38:56,554
From outer space. It`s science
fiction. Very big with the kids.

1265
01:38:56,631 --> 01:39:00,658
If you make this picture, you`ll
have enough money to finance
a hundred religious films...

1266
01:39:00,735 --> 01:39:03,761
and pay my back rent
with the profits.

1267
01:39:03,838 --> 01:39:07,330
I don`t know. This is, um,
all a lot to absorb.

1268
01:39:07,408 --> 01:39:10,809
- It`s a guaranteed blockbuster.
- Mmm.

1269
01:39:10,878 --> 01:39:14,507
Well, I understand this science fiction
is very popular, but, um...

1270
01:39:14,582 --> 01:39:17,847
uh, don`t the big hits
always have big stars?

1271
01:39:17,919 --> 01:39:20,353
Well, we have a big star.
Bela Lugosi.

1272
01:39:20,421 --> 01:39:24,016
Bela Lugosi--
Oh, I thought he passed on.

1273
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:28,256
Yes. Yes, he did.

1274
01:39:28,329 --> 01:39:30,092
But...

1275
01:39:32,867 --> 01:39:35,199
I`ve got the last footage
he ever shot.

1276
01:39:35,269 --> 01:39:38,705
Well, it doesn`t look
like very much.

1277
01:39:40,441 --> 01:39:42,671
Mr. Reynolds...

1278
01:39:42,743 --> 01:39:45,473
this is the acorn
that will grow a great oak.

1279
01:39:45,546 --> 01:39:49,949
I`ll just get a double to finish
his scenes, and we`ll release it
as Bela Lugosi`s final film.

1280
01:39:50,614 --> 01:39:53,105
Bunny, we`re making
another movie.

1281
01:39:53,184 --> 01:39:56,779
Yes, I got the Baptist Church
of Beverly Hills to put up the cash.

1282
01:39:56,854 --> 01:39:59,288
- Hold on.
- Ed, I got the Lugosi doubles outside.

1283
01:39:59,357 --> 01:40:01,291
Bunny, I gotta go.

1284
01:40:07,531 --> 01:40:09,795
He`s too short.

1285
01:40:09,867 --> 01:40:12,836
He`s too tall.

1286
01:40:12,903 --> 01:40:15,770
- He`s just not going to work.
- Well, Ed, I was thinkin`...

1287
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:18,832
like when Bela played Fu Manchu.

1288
01:40:18,909 --> 01:40:21,605
- Paul, that was Karloff.
- Oh.

1289
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:23,909
- You`re gonna have to try harder.
- Okay.
- Try to be a cut above.

1290
01:40:23,981 --> 01:40:26,211
- Okay.
- Go get `em.
- Right.
- Oh. Keep sunday open.

1291
01:40:26,283 --> 01:40:29,411
- The producers want us to get baptized.
- Okay.

1292
01:40:35,192 --> 01:40:38,184
You know, hon, when you rewrite a
script, it just gets better and better.

1293
01:40:41,098 --> 01:40:44,192
This is the ultimate Ed Wood movie.
No compromises.

1294
01:40:46,570 --> 01:40:49,767
- Oh, my. Eddie.
- Hmm?
- Look at this.

1295
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:52,104
What?

1296
01:40:52,176 --> 01:40:54,110
Poor girl`s out of a job.

1297
01:40:58,315 --> 01:41:02,615
I brought the script. You`ll
be portraying the ghoul`s wife.

1298
01:41:02,686 --> 01:41:06,622
- The ghoul`s wife?
- Yes.

1299
01:41:06,690 --> 01:41:10,990
You should feel lucky. Eddie`s
the only fella in town who
doesn`t pass judgment on people.

1300
01:41:11,062 --> 01:41:14,896
That`s right. If I did,
I wouldn`t have any friends.

1301
01:41:14,965 --> 01:41:18,264
Look, would it be possible to make the
ghoul`s wife a little less prominent...

1302
01:41:18,335 --> 01:41:20,428
so people wouldn`t really
notice me in the movie?

1303
01:41:20,504 --> 01:41:23,530
- You don`t want to be noticed?
- Yeah. How about this?

1304
01:41:23,607 --> 01:41:26,269
What if I don`t have any lines?
I`ll play the part mute.

1305
01:41:26,343 --> 01:41:28,937
- Mute?
- Hey, it`s Dr. Tom.

1306
01:41:29,013 --> 01:41:31,607
- Dr. Tom! Hiya!
- Who`s Dr. Tom?

1307
01:41:31,682 --> 01:41:34,845
- He`s my chiropractor.
- Hey, Kathy. How are you?

1308
01:41:34,919 --> 01:41:39,822
- Fine, thanks.
- Well, look at you. You`re
looking in alignment today.

1309
01:41:39,890 --> 01:41:43,053
Well, actually, my neck
is a little funny.

1310
01:41:43,127 --> 01:41:45,755
Oh, here.
Let me fix that.

1311
01:41:52,503 --> 01:41:55,370
- Ooh!
- Mm-hmm.

1312
01:41:58,075 --> 01:42:00,976
My gosh!

1313
01:42:01,045 --> 01:42:02,979
Don`t move.

1314
01:42:07,351 --> 01:42:08,784
It`s uncanny.

1315
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:13,183
Look at his head!
It`s uncanny!

1316
01:42:17,189 --> 01:42:21,819
Lift up your voice
and let us sing

1317
01:42:21,894 --> 01:42:26,729
Alleluia, alleluia

1318
01:42:26,798 --> 01:42:30,234
- Oh, burning sun and golden sea
- He looks nothin` like Bela.

1319
01:42:30,302 --> 01:42:34,500
- He`s kinda got his ears.
- Oh, look. Cover your face with this.

1320
01:42:36,408 --> 01:42:41,778
- Oh. Now I can see it.
- I want to suck your blood.

1321
01:42:41,847 --> 01:42:45,476
I want to suck your blood!

1322
01:42:45,551 --> 01:42:48,111
-Alleluia
- Let`s hear you call
Boris Karloff a cocksucker.

1323
01:42:48,186 --> 01:42:50,518
- Alleluia
- shh!

1324
01:42:50,589 --> 01:42:55,390
- Alleluia
- We want these Baptists
to like us. Please?

1325
01:42:56,895 --> 01:42:59,261
Brothers and sisters...

1326
01:42:59,331 --> 01:43:03,131
we reach now in the service
a joyous point...

1327
01:43:03,201 --> 01:43:07,433
because we are going to bear witness
to the baptism of our new members.

1328
01:43:07,506 --> 01:43:09,804
Why couldn`t we do this
in the church?

1329
01:43:09,875 --> 01:43:13,777
Because Brother Tor couldn`t
fit in the sacred tub.

1330
01:43:13,845 --> 01:43:16,075
Welcome to the fold, brother.

1331
01:43:18,317 --> 01:43:21,878
- Do you acceptJesus Christ
as your personal savior?
- Yes!

1332
01:43:21,954 --> 01:43:25,412
In the name of the Father,
the son and the Holy Ghost.

1333
01:43:25,490 --> 01:43:27,583
Amen.

1334
01:43:30,996 --> 01:43:33,021
Welcome to the fold, brother.

1335
01:43:33,098 --> 01:43:35,032
Welcome.

1336
01:43:36,335 --> 01:43:39,202
Praise the Lord, brother.

1337
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:46,710
- Do you reject satan and all his evils?
- sure.

1338
01:43:46,778 --> 01:43:50,270
In the name of the Father,
the son and the Holy Ghost.

1339
01:43:57,289 --> 01:44:00,452
Praise the Lord, friends!

1340
01:44:00,525 --> 01:44:02,516
- Do you repent for all of your sins?
- How do you do it?

1341
01:44:02,594 --> 01:44:04,721
- I do.
- How do you get all your
friends to get baptized...

1342
01:44:04,796 --> 01:44:07,526
- The Father, the son,
and the Holy Ghost.
-just so you can make a monster movie?

1343
01:44:07,599 --> 01:44:10,227
It`s not a monster movie.
It`s a supernatural thriller.

1344
01:44:10,302 --> 01:44:12,236
Come toJesus, brother!

1345
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:29,954
I can`t believe this.

1346
01:44:44,936 --> 01:44:47,598
- Ed, what am I gonna do here?
- What do you mean?

1347
01:44:47,673 --> 01:44:50,972
- He has no hair.
- Ah, gee, I never noticed that.

1348
01:44:51,043 --> 01:44:53,238
Put a wig on him.

1349
01:44:53,311 --> 01:44:56,212
Before we start shooting, Mr. Wood,
uh, we have a few questions.

1350
01:44:56,281 --> 01:45:00,684
Yes. The script contains
numerous references to grave robbing.

1351
01:45:00,752 --> 01:45:05,121
Now, we find the concept
of digging up consecrated ground
to be highly offensive.

1352
01:45:05,190 --> 01:45:07,715
- It is blasphemy.
- What are you talking about?

1353
01:45:07,793 --> 01:45:11,422
It`s the premise of the movie. It`s the
title of the movie, for Christ`s sakes!

1354
01:45:11,496 --> 01:45:14,829
- Mr. Wood!
- Yes. About that title.

1355
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:16,925
It strikes us
as very inflammatory.

1356
01:45:17,002 --> 01:45:21,029
Eh, why don`t we change it
to Plan 9 From Outer Space?

1357
01:45:21,106 --> 01:45:23,768
Huh! That`s ridiculous.

1358
01:45:26,344 --> 01:45:28,869
All right. And, action!

1359
01:45:32,551 --> 01:45:34,644
Medical examiner
been around yet?

1360
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:38,087
Just left. Uh, the morgue wagon
oughta be along most any time.

1361
01:45:38,156 --> 01:45:41,683
- You get their statement?
- Yeah, but they`re pretty scared.

1362
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:44,126
Fine mess like this
will frighten anyone.

1363
01:45:44,196 --> 01:45:49,566
You have one of the boys, uh,
take the guy and the girl
back to town. You take charge.

1364
01:45:49,634 --> 01:45:52,034
What`d you give him all the
lines for? He`s unintelligible.

1365
01:45:52,104 --> 01:45:54,095
Look, Lugosi`s dead
and Vampira won`t talk.

1366
01:45:54,172 --> 01:45:57,801
- I had to give somebody the dialogue.
- That is no answer!

1367
01:45:59,077 --> 01:46:01,068
What about glitter?

1368
01:46:01,146 --> 01:46:05,139
When I was a headliner in Paris,
audiences always liked it
when I sparkled.

1369
01:46:05,217 --> 01:46:07,276
No.

1370
01:46:07,352 --> 01:46:09,411
- Cat`s eyes.
- No!

1371
01:46:09,488 --> 01:46:12,048
- Well, I`m going to need some antennae.
- No!

1372
01:46:12,124 --> 01:46:14,558
You`re the ruler of the galaxy.
show a little taste!

1373
01:46:19,394 --> 01:46:21,658
see? No talking.
Isn`t he good?

1374
01:46:21,730 --> 01:46:24,597
- Cue Dr. Tom!
- N-Now?

1375
01:46:24,666 --> 01:46:26,725
Yes, now. Lurk him.

1376
01:46:33,074 --> 01:46:35,440
Be sure and keep
your face covered.

1377
01:46:43,485 --> 01:46:46,852
Isn`t it wonderful?
Bela lives.

1378
01:46:46,922 --> 01:46:49,322
Doesn`t it strike you
as a bit morbid?

1379
01:46:49,391 --> 01:46:51,359
No. He would`ve loved it.

1380
01:46:51,426 --> 01:46:55,419
Bela`s returned from the grave,
just like Dracula.

1381
01:46:55,497 --> 01:46:57,431
Cue Vampira!

1382
01:47:11,212 --> 01:47:14,978
- And, cut!
- Let`s go down and find out
whose grave it is.

1383
01:47:15,050 --> 01:47:18,042
Oh, why do I always get hooked up
with these spook details?

1384
01:47:18,119 --> 01:47:20,280
Monsters, graves, bodies!

1385
01:47:20,355 --> 01:47:22,289
Cue flying saucer!

1386
01:47:27,195 --> 01:47:29,220
And cut! Print.
We`re moving on.

1387
01:47:30,832 --> 01:47:33,096
- That was perfect.
- Perfect? Mr. Wood...

1388
01:47:33,168 --> 01:47:38,470
- do you know anything about
the art of film production?
- Well, I like to think so.

1389
01:47:38,540 --> 01:47:40,804
That cardboard headstone
tipped over.

1390
01:47:40,875 --> 01:47:43,309
Th-This graveyard
is obviously phony.

1391
01:47:44,713 --> 01:47:46,647
Nobody will ever notice that.

1392
01:47:46,715 --> 01:47:48,649
Filmmaking is not
about the tiny details.

1393
01:47:48,717 --> 01:47:51,413
- It`s about the big picture.
- The big picture?
- Yes.

1394
01:47:51,486 --> 01:47:55,252
Then how about when the
policemen arrived in daylight,
but now it`s suddenly night?

1395
01:47:55,323 --> 01:47:58,156
What do you know? Haven`t you
heard of suspension of disbelief?

1396
01:47:58,226 --> 01:48:02,162
- Reverend, I`m here.
- Ohh!

1397
01:48:02,230 --> 01:48:05,597
- Who is he?
- This is our choir director.

1398
01:48:05,667 --> 01:48:08,135
He`s going to play
the young hero.

1399
01:48:10,972 --> 01:48:14,203
Are you people insane?
I`m the director!

1400
01:48:14,275 --> 01:48:17,335
I make the casting decisions
around here!

1401
01:48:17,412 --> 01:48:19,710
Well, I thought this
was a group effort.

1402
01:48:19,781 --> 01:48:21,715
No!

1403
01:48:24,252 --> 01:48:27,187
- No?
- They`re driving me crazy!

1404
01:48:28,556 --> 01:48:33,391
These Baptists are stupid,
stupid, stupid!

1405
01:48:35,063 --> 01:48:38,555
Okay. I gotta calm down.

1406
01:48:38,633 --> 01:48:40,567
Gotta calm down.

1407
01:48:42,804 --> 01:48:45,034
Gotta calm down.

1408
01:48:45,106 --> 01:48:47,336
Take a deep breath.

1409
01:48:47,409 --> 01:48:49,343
Relax.

1410
01:48:54,712 --> 01:48:57,112
All right, everybody.
Let`s get set up for scene 1 1 2.

1411
01:48:57,182 --> 01:49:01,551
Move the crypt stage left,
and let`s get Tor`s makeup effect ready.

1412
01:49:01,619 --> 01:49:06,454
- Mr. Wood, what do you
think you`re doing?
- I`m directing.

1413
01:49:06,524 --> 01:49:08,515
Not like that, you`re not!

1414
01:49:08,593 --> 01:49:10,993
Remove that getup immediately.

1415
01:49:11,062 --> 01:49:12,996
You shame our Lord.

1416
01:49:17,235 --> 01:49:20,261
That`s it! I can`t take it!

1417
01:49:27,812 --> 01:49:30,110
Take me to the nearest bar
and make it snappy.

1418
01:49:40,859 --> 01:49:42,918
Imperial Whiskey.

1419
01:50:02,247 --> 01:50:05,080
Oh, my gosh.

1420
01:50:05,150 --> 01:50:07,084
Orson Welles.

1421
01:50:19,063 --> 01:50:21,725
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yes?

1422
01:50:23,535 --> 01:50:25,833
Well, I`m a young filmmaker
and a real big fan.

1423
01:50:25,904 --> 01:50:28,202
I-- I just wanted
to meet you.

1424
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:31,533
My pleasure.
I`m Orson Welles.

1425
01:50:31,609 --> 01:50:34,703
I`m, uh, Edward D. Wood,Jr.

1426
01:50:37,348 --> 01:50:39,680
What you working on?

1427
01:50:39,751 --> 01:50:43,812
Well, the financing just fell through
for the third time on Don Quixote.

1428
01:50:43,888 --> 01:50:47,346
Do you know? I can`t believe it. That
sounds just exactly like my problems.

1429
01:50:47,425 --> 01:50:51,828
It`s the damn money men. They never know
who`s a windbag and who`s got the goods.

1430
01:50:51,896 --> 01:50:54,660
- Then they all think they`re directors.
- Ain`t that the truth.

1431
01:50:54,732 --> 01:50:57,895
Do you know that I`ve even had
producers re-cut my movies?

1432
01:50:57,969 --> 01:51:01,132
- I hate when that happens.
- And they`re always trying
to cast their buddies.

1433
01:51:01,206 --> 01:51:04,300
- It doesn`t even matter
if they`re right for the part.
- Tell me about it.

1434
01:51:04,375 --> 01:51:06,809
I`m supposed to do
a thriller at Universal...

1435
01:51:06,878 --> 01:51:09,472
but they want Charlton Heston
to play a Mexican.

1436
01:51:11,816 --> 01:51:15,718
Ah, Mr. Welles,
is it all worth it?

1437
01:51:15,787 --> 01:51:18,051
It is when it works.

1438
01:51:18,122 --> 01:51:21,683
You know, the one film of mine
where I had total control, Kane?

1439
01:51:21,759 --> 01:51:24,353
The studio hated it...

1440
01:51:24,429 --> 01:51:27,660
but they didn`t get
to touch a frame.

1441
01:51:27,732 --> 01:51:30,462
- Ed.
- Yes?

1442
01:51:30,535 --> 01:51:33,197
Visions are worth fighting for.

1443
01:51:33,271 --> 01:51:36,434
Why spend your life making
someone else`s dreams?

1444
01:51:42,347 --> 01:51:44,281
Thank you...

1445
01:51:45,316 --> 01:51:47,079
Orson.

1446
01:51:49,854 --> 01:51:51,515
- Mr. Reynolds?
- Yes.

1447
01:51:51,589 --> 01:51:53,716
We are gonna finish this picture
just the way I want it...

1448
01:51:53,791 --> 01:51:55,782
because you cannot compromise
an artist`s vision.

1449
01:51:55,860 --> 01:51:58,192
-But it`s our money.
-And you`re gonna make a bundle...

1450
01:51:58,263 --> 01:52:01,130
but only if you shut up
and let me do things my way.

1451
01:52:01,199 --> 01:52:06,227
All right, gang. Actors in positions.
Let`s finish this picture.

1452
01:52:16,213 --> 01:52:18,408
Action!

1453
01:52:27,758 --> 01:52:30,852
Wanna give him a hand?
Keep rolling.

1454
01:52:48,913 --> 01:52:53,043
Now, that`s an alien.
Action!

1455
01:52:59,957 --> 01:53:02,790
- What plan will you follow now?
- Plan 9.

1456
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:05,727
Plan 9. Ah, yes.

1457
01:53:05,796 --> 01:53:09,425
Plan 9 deals with
the resurrection of the dead.

1458
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:11,593
Long-distance electrodes shot...

1459
01:53:11,669 --> 01:53:15,867
into the pineal and pituitary
glands of the recent dead.

1460
01:53:15,940 --> 01:53:18,966
You know, maybe you guys were right.
Plan 9 is a good title.

1461
01:53:19,043 --> 01:53:21,170
I want that lightning,
I want those two explosions...

1462
01:53:21,245 --> 01:53:23,907
- and I`ve got to have
more shots of the military!
- Right.

1463
01:53:47,471 --> 01:53:49,530
And, cut!
All right, friends.

1464
01:53:49,607 --> 01:53:51,541
Prepare for scene 3 2.

1465
01:53:51,609 --> 01:53:53,543
- M-Mr. Wood?
- Yeah?

1466
01:53:53,611 --> 01:53:56,739
- Where`s the cockpit set?
- You`re standing in it.

1467
01:53:56,814 --> 01:53:58,748
Places!

1468
01:54:15,466 --> 01:54:17,832
But what if we develop
this solenite bomb?

1469
01:54:17,902 --> 01:54:20,097
Then we`d be
a stronger nation too.

1470
01:54:20,171 --> 01:54:22,366
stronger? You see?

1471
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:25,375
You see? Your stupid minds.

1472
01:54:25,443 --> 01:54:27,377
stupid! stupid!

1473
01:54:27,445 --> 01:54:29,777
- That`s all I`m gonna take out of you!
- Oh!

1474
01:54:33,350 --> 01:54:35,784
Cut. Action.

1475
01:54:43,060 --> 01:54:45,358
Greetings, my friend.

1476
01:54:45,429 --> 01:54:47,363
We are all interested
in the future...

1477
01:54:47,431 --> 01:54:52,095
for that is where you and I are going
to spend the rest of our lives.

1478
01:54:52,169 --> 01:54:54,399
And remember, my friend...

1479
01:54:54,472 --> 01:54:58,704
future events such as these
will effect you in the future.

1480
01:55:16,093 --> 01:55:18,561
And, cut!

1481
01:55:20,331 --> 01:55:21,696
That`s a wrap.

1482
01:55:38,307 --> 01:55:40,241
Ohh!

1483
01:55:46,382 --> 01:55:48,213
I can`t get it up.
It`s stuck.

1484
01:55:48,284 --> 01:55:51,310
Eddie, you`re gonna be late
for your own premiere.

1485
01:55:51,387 --> 01:55:53,321
All right. Forget it.

1486
01:55:58,127 --> 01:56:02,757
Ladies and gentlemen, you`re about
to see an extraordinary motion picture.

1487
01:56:02,832 --> 01:56:07,030
But before it begins, I think
we should all give a hand to the man...

1488
01:56:07,103 --> 01:56:10,903
without whom we wouldn`t
be here tonight.

1489
01:56:10,973 --> 01:56:12,600
Eddie, take a bow!

1490
01:56:50,846 --> 01:56:53,508
Thanks a million.

1491
01:56:53,582 --> 01:56:56,073
I just want to say...

1492
01:56:56,152 --> 01:56:58,211
that this film...

1493
01:56:58,287 --> 01:57:00,881
is for Bela.

1494
01:57:49,438 --> 01:57:52,168
The grief ofhis wife`s death...

1495
01:57:52,241 --> 01:57:54,675
became greater
and greater agony.

1496
01:57:56,846 --> 01:58:00,145
The home they had
so long shared together...

1497
01:58:00,216 --> 01:58:02,480
became a tomb...

1498
01:58:02,551 --> 01:58:06,009
a sweet memory
ofherjoyous living.

1499
01:58:07,490 --> 01:58:10,357
The sky to which
he had once looked...

1500
01:58:10,426 --> 01:58:14,021
was now only a covering
for her dead body.

1501
01:58:21,670 --> 01:58:25,766
The ever-beautiful flowers
she had planted...

1502
01:58:25,841 --> 01:58:27,775
with her own hands...

1503
01:58:27,843 --> 01:58:32,212
became nothing more than
the lost roses ofher cheeks.

1504
01:58:35,251 --> 01:58:37,685
Confused by his great loss...

1505
01:58:37,753 --> 01:58:40,517
the old man left that home...

1506
01:58:40,589 --> 01:58:43,217
never to return again.

1507
01:58:58,107 --> 01:59:00,234
This is the one.

1508
01:59:00,309 --> 01:59:03,278
This is the one
I`ll be remembered for.

1509
01:59:07,850 --> 01:59:10,978
Ah, gee, honey,
I`m so happy for ya.

1510
01:59:11,053 --> 01:59:14,454
- say, let`s get married.
- Huh?

1511
01:59:14,523 --> 01:59:19,153
- Right now. Let`s go to Vegas.
- But, Eddie, it`s pouring
and the car top is stuck.
- Phooey!

1512
01:59:19,228 --> 01:59:22,288
It`s only a five-hour drive,
and it`ll probably stop by
the time we get to the desert.

1513
01:59:22,364 --> 01:59:24,958
Heck, it`ll probably stop
by the time we get around the corner.

1514
01:59:25,034 --> 01:59:27,400
Let`s go.

1515
01:59:28,504 --> 01:59:30,438
Ohh!
