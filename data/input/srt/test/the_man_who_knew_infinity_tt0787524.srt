1
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,435
<i>I have
to form myself,</i>

2
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,353
<i>as I have never really formed before,</i>

3
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,593
<i>and try to help you
to form some sort of reasoned estimate</i>

4
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,272
<i>of the most romantic figure</i>

5
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,749
<i>in the recent history of mathematics.</i>

6
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,869
<i>Ramanujan was an Indian,</i>

7
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,918
<i>and I suppose
that it is always a little difficult</i>

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,592
<i>for an Englishman and an Indian</i>

9
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,955
<i>to understand one another properly.</i>

10
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,917
<i>I owe more to him
than to anyone else in the world,</i>

11
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,474
<i>and my association with him
is the one romantic incident of my life.</i>

12
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,879
<i>He was, in a way, my discovery.</i>

13
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,079
<i>I did not invent him.</i>

14
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,517
<i>Like other great men,
he invented himself.</i>

15
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,633
<i>The difficulty for me, then,</i>

16
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,917
<i>is not that I do not know
enough about him,</i>

17
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,915
<i>but that I know and feel too much.</i>

18
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,438
You can also see I've been conducting

19
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,078
my own mathematical researches.

20
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,910
You've no degree.
You're unemployable.

21
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,716
I'll write you
a recommendation. Maybe someone...

22
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,314
With all due respect, sir,
I have recommendations.

23
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,439
What I need is a job.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,877
Please. I have a wife.

25
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,439
You people are all the same.

26
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,351
Now get out. Now!

27
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,272
I'm doomed, like Galileo.

28
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,788
He died in poverty, you know.

29
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,758
At least
you hold yourself in good esteem.

30
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,351
Whatever is
written in your fate will happen.

31
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,555
You can't change that.

32
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,995
My fate is to have a wife
who lives with my mother

33
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,456
while I sleep here with you all because

34
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,040
the British think I'm a raving lunatic.

35
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,153
As do we Indians.

36
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,760
<i>Where did you get your degree?</i>

37
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,273
<i>I don't have one.</i>

38
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,996
- How many do you have?
- None.

39
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,515
- Who else have you shown this to?
- Everyone.

40
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,319
The British. The Indians.
They all send me to someone else.

41
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,118
I can offer you a job,

42
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,036
but your evenings will have to be spent
in helping me understand this.

43
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,355
A job?

44
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,032
- Do we have an agreement?
- Yes.

45
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,198
- Most certainly, sir.
- Good.

46
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,110
Send for your wife
so you can be together.

47
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,434
And put this on.

48
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,915
Follow me.

49
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,514
Sir Francis, here are today's ledgers.

50
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,874
And our new clerk.

51
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,115
Narayana, how long
have you worked for me?

52
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,153
Since I helped to design
the bridge on the Godavari,

53
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,800
which now requires me to call you "Sir".

54
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,713
Sir Francis.

55
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,389
This man looks as if
he lives on the streets.

56
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,391
- Get him out of here.
- Sir, please.

57
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,239
Forgive my appearance,

58
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,595
but I really am
quite exceptional with numbers.

59
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,996
What you might see now
is ordinary glass,

60
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,117
I promise you will
soon remain to see a diamond.

61
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,348
Well...

62
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,949
Your accounts had
better be half as polished as your ego.

63
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,678
<i>Amma,</i> this is it.

64
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,752
It's the best I could do for now.

65
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,313
It's a home.

66
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,314
Please.

67
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,193
Where is the kitchen?

68
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,713
It's inside.

69
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,639
Ah!

70
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,674
From the wedding.

71
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,590
Don't worry. I will sleep on the floor.

72
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,033
I'm used to it.

73
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,115
I have to go back to work now.

74
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,671
Why aren't you using the abacus?

75
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,113
It was faster in my head.

76
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,234
Impressive.

77
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,877
If Sir Francis comes here,
at least pretend to use this.

78
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,949
Hmm.

79
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,789
I see you've been working
on your own formulas.

80
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,071
Paper is a precious commodity here.

81
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,749
You'll find
plenty of packing down at the docks.

82
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,239
Thank you, sir.

83
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,634
See you tonight.

84
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,553
<i>Ramanujan,</i>

85
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,918
we need to seek an audience

86
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,634
with someone who really
understands all this.

87
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,672
I've been to everyone in Madras.

88
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,948
Madras.

89
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,679
Did you know that the name
derives from Mandarajya?

90
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,476
"The realm of the stupid."

91
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,795
There's a whole world out there.

92
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,472
And there's England.

93
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,314
You don't come home.

94
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,077
It is I who
owe the apology for keeping him.

95
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,315
I think it's
enough for tonight, Ramanujan.

96
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,719
I'm sorry.

97
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,990
I was told
you love numbers more than people.

98
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,435
Some.

99
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,674
Not you.

100
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,876
Perhaps we can start over.

101
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,997
I am Ramanujan.

102
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,192
And I am your wife.

103
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,070
Go ahead. You can look.

104
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,314
Please.

105
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,674
What does it all do?

106
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,075
It's like a painting, I think.

107
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,074
Only imagine it
is with colors you cannot see.

108
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,559
What good is that?

109
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,114
Not much for you, I'm afraid.
But for me it is everything.

110
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,553
Maybe there is someone else who can

111
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,757
see and understand it as well.

112
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,277
And for them it will be important.

113
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,919
Have you met them?

114
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,873
No. Not yet.

115
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,799
I want to understand
more than just colors I can't see.

116
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,668
What do you see?

117
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,398
- Sand.
- Yes.

118
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,028
Imagine, if we could
look so closely, we could see each grain,

119
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,592
each particle.

120
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,554
You see, there are...
There are patterns in everything.

121
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,793
The color in light.

122
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,439
The reflections on water.

123
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,349
In maths, these patterns
reveal themselves

124
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,112
in the most incredible form.

125
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,951
It's quite beautiful.

126
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,119
You should sleep in the bed.

127
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,829
<i>- Amma.</i>
- Hmm?

128
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,752
I have made a friend in my boss.

129
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,637
He's going to find somebody
to understand my work outside Madras.

130
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,389
Outside India.

131
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,840
That is an honor.

132
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,432
What nonsense are you talking?

133
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,670
<i>Amma,</i> he sees something in me.

134
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,356
He surely sees enough of you.
You're never here at home.

135
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,671
<i>Kanna,</i> we are Brahmins.

136
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,192
It is forbidden to cross the seas.

137
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,599
Ramanujan?

138
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,350
Ramanujan, listen to me.

139
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,269
This work is
too important to die with you.

140
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,032
It must be published.

141
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,550
If you, an Indian,
are at the pinnacle with these formulas,

142
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,029
then the British,
even while they subjugate us,

143
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,670
must recognize that our
brightest matches theirs.

144
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,188
<i>Anna,</i> please.

145
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,034
I can't.

146
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,712
You have been
alone in your mind your whole life.

147
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,395
Now other people
have the chance to understand you.

148
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,799
Not just your Namagiri.

149
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,074
Imagine.

150
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,828
All I do is imagine.

151
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,511
<i>These first two letters...</i>

152
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,869
Baker.

153
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,308
Hobson.

154
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,108
And who's this?

155
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,909
Oh, that's, er...
That's Hardy. He's a real pot stirrer.

156
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,748
You know, he single-handedly reformed

157
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,150
the entire Tripos examination system.

158
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,193
Turned over hundreds of years of history.

159
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,919
He's your man.

160
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,959
Trinity, eh?

161
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,716
Kings, prime ministers.

162
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,956
Isaac Newton. Byron.

163
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,592
Now perhaps even you.

164
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,075
Hmm.

165
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,953
Trouble on the Continent?

166
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,439
There will be.

167
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,152
We beat the Frogs
by a goal at Twickenham.

168
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,759
I meant in the Balkans.

169
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,876
Ah, the Balkans.

170
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,473
You've got one
there seems particularly well traveled.

171
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,639
Do you think it's another hoax?

172
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,995
Hmm.

173
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,748
"I beg to introduce myself
as a clerk in the Accounts Department."

174
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,391
- What this time?
- Quite impressive, really.

175
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,993
Someone's gone to a lot of trouble.

176
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,918
A Hindu clerk!

177
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,550
And who claims he can give meaning

178
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,200
to the negative values
of the gamma function.

179
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,359
- Littlewood?
- Without doubt.

180
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,515
You know, Littlewood,

181
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,839
this year alone,
I've received correspondence

182
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,239
from those who profess

183
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,876
to prove the
prophetic wisdom of the Pyramids,

184
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,437
the revelations of the Elders of Zion,

185
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,151
and the cryptograms,
which Bacon supposedly buried

186
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,989
within the plays
of the so-called Shakespeare.

187
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,555
But a letter from
an ill-educated Indian clerk in Madras,

188
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,712
challenging assertions
I made in the tracts series,

189
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,233
really takes the biscuit.

190
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,278
Well, I have to say,
I've made similar assertions myself.

191
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,073
So you admit it?

192
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,709
But this was three years ago.

193
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,275
No, no, no. I'm talking about the letter.

194
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,016
Bloody brilliant, I thought.
I don't know where you got the postmark.

195
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,758
Almost had me fooled.

196
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,358
I simply don't know
what you're talking about.

197
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,071
Oh, come on. I'm not a complete idiot.

198
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,599
I don't know how to get this
into your thick skull,

199
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,876
but whatever it is you're talking about,

200
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,632
I'm simply not involved.

201
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,755
Play.

202
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,595
Sir.

203
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,549
You've missed Hall.

204
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,029
Not hungry.

205
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,113
I tell you,
there is a war coming, no doubt about it.

206
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,634
Because we are being
led like mindless, spineless sheep

207
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,475
and no one bothers to question any of it.

208
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,120
It's coming, all right. You can smell it.

209
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,271
You're as paranoid as Hardy.

210
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,199
With all due respect, Bertie,
you couldn't hold a candle.

211
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,317
Littlewood, could I have a word?

212
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,434
Yes, of course.

213
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,195
Integrals.

214
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,793
Infinite series.

215
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,359
God knows what else.

216
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,239
Oh, excuse me.

217
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,796
I always forget
you don't believe in a supreme being.

218
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Right.

219
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,918
If this chap turns out to be genuine, you
might have to reconsider.

220
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,394
He must be genuine.

221
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,835
Who would have
the imagination to invent all that?

222
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,310
Well, I'm rather
flattered you thought I did.

223
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,668
These two infinite series
are the more intriguing.

224
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,273
Yeah. They defeated me completely.

225
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,992
I've never seen anything like them.

226
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,153
Well, it's deceptive.

227
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,554
I'll wager the hypergeometric series.

228
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,513
Ha! Our great Littlewood, stumped.

229
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,557
He's Hobbs class, I'd say.

230
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,157
"Being inexperienced,

231
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,312
"I would very
highly value any advice you give me.

232
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,198
"Yours truly, S. Ramanujan."

233
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,399
What does the "S" stand for?

234
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,439
You can ask him yourself.

235
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,199
You intend to invite him here?

236
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,719
Well, no, no, no, no, no.

237
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,914
Much better, let him
rot away in his office in Madras, hmm?

238
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,277
- Hmm?
- Ah, Mr. Ramanujan.

239
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,240
There seems to be a letter for you.

240
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,834
Postmarked England.
Cambridge, England.

241
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,910
From a Mr. G. H. Hardy.

242
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,080
I used to come here
and watch the boats leaving.

243
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,913
I always wondered what it would be
like to be on one of them.

244
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,039
I'm finally here
and you talk of crossing the sea?

245
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,313
It is forbidden for us.

246
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,992
I don't understand.

247
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,791
If you go, it will never be the same.

248
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,190
This is not Calcutta or Bombay.

249
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,478
No one will marry our
children. No one will even talk to us!

250
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,312
Then we will move to
Calcutta or Bombay.

251
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,915
Besides,
I don't want to talk to anyone but you.

252
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,909
Do you promise to bring me
as soon as you are able?

253
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,109
Yes.

254
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,432
Then that is what we will do.

255
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,471
Are you sure
you want me to do it?

256
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,308
Cut it.

257
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,189
You cut your hair.

258
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,828
What have you done?

259
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,757
<i>Amma,</i> I've decided to go to England.

260
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,075
Did you?

261
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,037
Or did she convince you?

262
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,749
So that both of you could
run away together? Huh?

263
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,278
This is all her doing.

264
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,031
She wants you all to herself.

265
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,230
Please look after
each other while I'm gone.

266
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,237
Never forget your prayers.

267
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,152
You cannot
pollute yourself with their food,

268
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,356
if you ever want to come back.

269
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,674
Don't forget me.

270
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,959
I could never.

271
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,029
I promise.

272
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,999
Well, off we go.

273
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,155
6,000 miles. Can you imagine?

274
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,152
I've known larger numbers.

275
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,875
Don't let it ruin
your big day with <i>Gunga Din.</i>

276
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,313
I'm sure it won't mean war.

277
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,512
All this Din, Din, Din.

278
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,872
Are you Ramanujan, by chance?

279
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,037
- Very much by chance.
- Ah.

280
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,233
- Hello. Sorry.
- Oh.

281
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,870
John Littlewood. Such a pleasure.

282
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,030
I was just on my way to meet you.

283
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,510
Well, shall we go together?

284
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,475
Yes.

285
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,799
The intended effect.

286
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,119
Don't be intimidated.

287
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,073
Great knowledge often comes
from the humblest of origins.

288
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,119
Come along.

289
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,548
You see that sapling?

290
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,875
That's the very tree
under which Newton sat,

291
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,159
when the apple dropped on his
head and he invented gravity.

292
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,912
This way. We've been
anticipating your arrival for some time.

293
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,473
<i>Well, I think it's criminal.</i>

294
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,896
I mean, we bring these Indians over

295
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,638
at great expense and look what happens.

296
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,275
Yeah, well, it's not just
that this chap is Ramjin,

297
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,555
whatever his name is, is Indian.

298
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,349
After all, we do have
Indian students here.

299
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,870
Just not ones
with no education to speak of.

300
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,359
It's a disgrace.

301
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,990
Ramanujan is a special case.

302
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,951
Uh, why is that, exactly?

303
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,593
We've all read his letter.

304
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,438
There are no proofs.

305
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,990
Are we just supposed
to take him at his word?

306
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,795
No.

307
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,799
You're to take him at mine.

308
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,679
Change, gentlemen.

309
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,359
It's a wonderful thing. Embrace it.

310
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,435
Take it as
a sign of respect to quieten this lot.

311
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,832
Is Mr. Hardy here?

312
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,111
I'm most excited to meet him.

313
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,788
He must be a very kind man
to bring me all this way.

314
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,275
Mmm.

315
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,312
Ah. Speak of the devil.

316
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,149
Hello.

317
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,708
I'm Hardy.

318
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,680
Welcome to Trinity, Mr. Ramanujan.

319
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,839
Am I pronouncing that properly?

320
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,989
Yes, sir.

321
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,399
Perfectly.

322
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,152
It's an honor, sir.

323
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,879
Thank you.

324
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,399
I very much look forward
to beginning our work.

325
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,800
So, tomorrow, 10:00, my rooms.
I look forward to it.

326
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,394
Did I say something wrong?

327
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,354
Don't worry.

328
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,474
I'll look out for you.

329
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,915
That's if you believe he actually exists.

330
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,336
You see, there's
speculation that Mr. Littlewood here

331
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,432
is merely a figment
of Hardy's imagination.

332
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,957
If he ever makes a mistake, he'll
have someone else to blame.

333
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,878
Ramanujan, Bertrand Russell.

334
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,599
Welcome to our little asylum.

335
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,749
Hello.

336
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,672
Come along, come along.

337
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,272
Get off the grass!

338
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,398
It's for Fellows only!

339
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,797
Excuse me, sir.
Could you direct me to New Court?

340
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,552
- To Mr. Hardy?
- Through there.

341
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,272
You have something on your forehead.

342
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,039
Oh. Thank you.

343
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,115
The shoes, they hurt my feet.

344
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,798
Sorry I'm late.

345
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,231
You see, you do exist.

346
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,549
Yes.

347
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,629
Right.

348
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,912
Ramanujan, we've decided that
for the good of everybody

349
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,309
you should attend some lectures.

350
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,677
But I'm here to publish.

351
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,230
Yes. All in good time, I hope.

352
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,195
But first we need proofs of your work.

353
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,835
It's really nothing to worry about.

354
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:37,118
It's simply a question of acquainting you
with the more formal methods

355
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,475
that will benefit our future work together.

356
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,632
I mean, we need a common language.

357
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,193
You wouldn't expect us to converse with
you in Tamil.

358
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,079
No. But you expect me to speak English.

359
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,554
Quite.

360
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,075
So, there will be
plenty of time for publishing.

361
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,032
I'm sorry, but with all
humility, how does anyone know that?

362
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,752
I don't want this to die with me.

363
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,918
I assure you it won't.

364
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,673
Thank you, sir.
But I have much more to share with you.

365
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,435
As I told you,

366
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,199
the letter only contained
a small sampling of my discoveries.

367
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,790
You'll see I have even found a function

368
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,190
which exactly represents the number
of prime numbers less than X

369
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,077
in the form of an infinite series.

370
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,994
- Exactly?
- Yes.

371
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,376
I thought if we were going to publish,

372
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,436
it should be
something, uh, ground-breaking.

373
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,079
This is

374
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,114
most unexpected.

375
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,429
Hardy.
This will take a lifetime.

376
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,279
Maybe two.

377
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,200
It's quite alarming to see you so
thoroughly pleased with yourself.

378
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,800
Can't have anything to do
with these notebooks, can it?

379
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,197
You could spend the rest of your
life trying to prove half of it

380
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,309
and never have
another original idea of your own.

381
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,949
Bertie.

382
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,112
If I could prove, by logic,
that you are gonna die in five minutes,

383
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,158
I'd be sorry,

384
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,357
but my sorrow would be
very much mitigated

385
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,119
by the pleasure in the proof.

386
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,995
Might get your wish granted with half
the Continent up in flames

387
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,030
and old men like that running the show.

388
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,235
No.

389
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,550
No, you're just a bit sore because

390
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,995
you're worried he'll be
up there before you are.

391
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,436
Hmm, I doubt
a dark face will ever grace these walls,

392
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,112
let alone become a Fellow.

393
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,315
Hmm.

394
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,671
Ramanujan! Over here!

395
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,079
Come over, sit with us.

396
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,629
Welcome to Hall.

397
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,080
- I'm Chandra Mahalanobis.
- Hello.

398
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,235
And this is Andrew Hartley.

399
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,469
I am Ramanujan.

400
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,318
Well, everyone knows
who you are, mate.

401
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,390
Word's out you've
taken on the prime number theorem.

402
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,160
It is quite extraordinary,
them bringing you here like this.

403
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,949
Such an honor.

404
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,999
There are other Indians?

405
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,350
A few. You're from the South?

406
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,592
Calcutta myself.

407
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,718
This must be quite a shock for you.

408
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,350
Truth is, you've more in
common than you think.

409
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,037
His father was a
schoolteacher. Not exactly Trinity stock.

410
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,800
Hardy's earned it on his own merits.

411
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,440
It's probably why he's taken to you.

412
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,273
Does he have a wife?

413
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,640
No.

414
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,438
He's married to his work, as they say.

415
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,593
I suppose that means you now.

416
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,714
Stop. He's a vegetarian.

417
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,953
Very sorry.

418
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,119
Potatoes, sir.

419
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,994
How's that any better?
The potatoes are cooked in lard.

420
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,113
- I'm so sorry.
- Not at all.

421
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,118
But... But I think I will go.

422
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,959
I hope to see you soon.

423
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,634
Ramanujan.

424
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,353
Did you have a good dinner?

425
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,034
They make a fine mutton.

426
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,194
Yes, sir.

427
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,753
Delicious.

428
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,550
And your... Your rooms?

429
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,159
Satisfactory?

430
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,477
I want everything to be to your advantage

431
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,032
so that we can
be as productive as possible.

432
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,675
Thank you, sir.

433
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,273
Very nice paper.

434
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,148
Well...

435
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,073
Use it wisely.

436
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,799
Well, I'll say good night, then.

437
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,717
All right. Now...

438
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,311
You. Are you following this?

439
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,910
Yes, sir. Most excitedly.

440
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,496
But you don't
appear to be taking any notes.

441
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,240
Is there something
you'd like to contribute?

442
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,433
Well, come on, then.

443
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,388
Come on!

444
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,199
You'll need the chalk.

445
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,636
But I... I hadn't completed that proof.

446
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,989
How do you know?

447
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,715
I don't know. I just do.

448
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,110
Well, gentlemen,
it appears that our time is up.

449
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,918
Thank you for your attention.

450
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,428
Not you.

451
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,958
Little wog, let me tell you something.

452
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,229
You don't pull
a stunt like that in my class.

453
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,474
You don't belong
here and you can tell your Master Hardy

454
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,953
I said as much! Now, get out!

455
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,033
My sacred thread.

456
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,991
It's to help ward off evil spirits.

457
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,032
How did it work with Mr. Howard?

458
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,394
I'm sorry, sir.

459
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,879
I got too excited.

460
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,674
Not a word
often associated with his lectures.

461
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,832
How did you know that theorem?

462
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,513
It came to me.

463
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,676
Mr. Hardy, I don't understand
why we waste our time

464
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,994
doing all these proofs.

465
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,319
I have the formulas.

466
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,875
It's not that I can't see
what you've claimed.

467
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,359
It's that I'm not
sure that you know how you got there

468
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,792
or, indeed, that your claims are correct.

469
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,119
There are subtleties which...

470
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,633
But they are right, sir.

471
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,718
I have more important new ideas.

472
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,712
Yes, but intuition is not enough. It has
to be held accountable.

473
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,034
And a little humility would go a long way.

474
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,749
Why do you think they want us to fail?

475
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,233
Because I am Indian.

476
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,319
Well, yeah, there is that.

477
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:52,273
But also because of what we represent.

478
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,158
Now, Euler and Jacobi. Who are they?

479
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,595
Mathematicians.

480
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,875
Just names to you.

481
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,993
Euler was the most productive
mathematician of the 18th century.

482
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,676
Most of his work done after he was blind.

483
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,830
Jacobi, like you,
was snatched from obscurity,

484
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,070
and was almost as impressive as Euler.

485
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,429
Now, I think you are in their class.

486
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,317
What they had in common,
what I see in you, is a love of form.

487
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,998
It's all through your notebooks.

488
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,589
Let me ask you something.

489
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,552
Why do you do it, any of this?

490
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,554
Because I have to. I see it.

491
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,079
Like Euler. Form for its own sake.

492
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,752
An art unto itself.

493
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,714
And, like all art, it reflects truth.

494
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,790
It's the only truth I know. It's my church.

495
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,878
And you,

496
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,269
just as Mozart could
hear an entire symphony in his head,

497
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,112
you dance with numbers to infinity.

498
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,918
But this dance, this art,

499
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,753
does little to endear us
to certain factions

500
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,319
who see us as mere conjurors.

501
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,040
So if we are going
to challenge areas of mathematics

502
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,348
that are so well trod,

503
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,715
we cannot afford to be wrong.

504
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,997
I need you to attend your lectures,
don't offend your professors,

505
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,673
and keep doing your proofs,

506
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,228
otherwise this experiment of
ours will be doomed to failure.

507
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,348
Come with me.

508
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,991
I wanna show you something.

509
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,431
There are many ways
to be honored in life.

510
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,151
For us, being
elected a Fellow is certainly one,

511
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,672
but in my humble opinion

512
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,671
to leave a legacy,

513
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,273
here at the Wren

514
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,839
after we're gone

515
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,113
is the greatest.

516
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,509
This library houses
the Epistles of Saint Paul,

517
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,673
the poems of Milton,

518
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,353
Morgan's Bible.

519
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,236
But in my estimation,
as a man of numbers,

520
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:03,713
the pièce de résistance
is Newton's <i>Principia Mathematica.</i>

521
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,112
Now, just as Newton represents the
physical aspect of our work,

522
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,873
your notebooks represent the abstract.

523
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,155
T ook a long time for
Newton to be proved.

524
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,517
Which is why we
have an obligation to prove these.

525
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,115
And if we do, I believe that one day...

526
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,549
One day these notebooks
will find their place here.

527
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,473
Now, do you understand
what's at stake here?

528
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,714
Good.

529
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,149
<i>I hope
you are taking care of yourself</i>

530
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,716
<i>and that Mr. Hardy is good to you.</i>

531
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,193
<i>Everyone here is so proud of you.</i>

532
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,551
<i>But most proud of all is me.</i>

533
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,356
<i>I spend every day missing you,</i>

534
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,317
<i>and waiting for your letter to tell me</i>

535
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,595
<i>I'm coming to be with you
across the ocean.</i>

536
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,153
<i>You are my everything.</i>

537
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,399
I've discovered a new series.

538
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,976
Look, I'm not interested in a new series.

539
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,878
I thought I'd explained this.
I need your proofs.

540
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,714
We had an agreement.

541
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,996
Just, please, look at it, sir. It is true.

542
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,474
How do you know that?

543
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,908
Because it is written.

544
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,553
Written where, Ramanujan?

545
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,155
Hmm?

546
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,913
Now, take my coat, go home

547
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,797
and get properly dressed
before you freeze.

548
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,037
Sir, I've come a very long way to be here.

549
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,117
And you promised to help me publish.

550
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,434
Don't look at me like that.
It's for his own good.

551
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,198
You wouldn't think he's so bloody
smart by the way he dresses.

552
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,349
Huh.

553
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,272
What the devil is that, anyway?

554
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,713
Partitions.

555
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,399
No, no, no, wait.

556
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,312
This even you could understand.

557
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,479
P of 4

558
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,199
equals 5.

559
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,992
Now, all that means is there are five
ways to add up the number 4.

560
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,116
1 + 1 + 1 + 1,

561
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,588
3 + 1,

562
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,678
2 + 1 + 1,

563
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,914
2 + 2,

564
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,348
and 4.

565
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,159
Seems simple enough.

566
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,510
Yeah. So it does.

567
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,558
But when you raise
the number of P to 100,

568
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,510
there are 204,226

569
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,749
different combinations.

570
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,913
Major MacMahon
did it by hand. Took him weeks.

571
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:03,279
And now he thinks
he can figure out a formula.

572
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,998
Plug in the number, any number,

573
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,356
and out comes
the number of partitions. Like magic.

574
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,038
I take it you have tried
to crack this one before?

575
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,628
It's considered impossible. Unsolvable.

576
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,790
A bloody rabbit hole
mystery of the universe.

577
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,873
Until now?

578
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,269
"Din! Din! Din! Gunga Din."

579
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,233
So, um...

580
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,715
Using the divergence theorem,

581
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,758
what is the flux

582
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,719
of F through S here?

583
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,588
What on earth's he doing?

584
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,719
- Proofs. Yeah.
- Proofs?

585
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,237
You should let him run, Hardy.

586
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,513
You shouldn't stifle him.

587
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,479
He's gone to the cricket.

588
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,355
Just, uh, follow the umbrella.

589
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,189
Sir!

590
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,039
Mr. Hardy!

591
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,953
Mr. Hardy.

592
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,908
Oh, I've been over those proofs of yours,

593
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,069
if you can call them that, very carefully.

594
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,438
And I've marked where
you're missing steps

595
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,879
and where you've made mistakes.

596
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,280
There's much more I could say, but
that's where you should begin.

597
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,193
Listen, I'm hard on you
for your own benefit.

598
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,720
So that you can be published.

599
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,176
But, sir, you can publish the notebooks

600
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,376
and my prime number theorem.
You've had them since I arrived.

601
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,416
There is nothing I'd like more.
But, if I was to publish them

602
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,908
in their present state,
I'd be sent to the lunatic asylum.

603
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,470
You don't understand. These...

604
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,296
I don't think about this
the same way you do.

605
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,038
These steps you want, what you want,

606
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,348
I do not know how to do.

607
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,512
Well, you can just begin
by trying your best

608
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,238
and see if you don't surprise yourself.

609
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,600
Sir, do you know something I don't?

610
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,834
Apparently not.

611
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,832
Oh, no, God and I
don't see exactly eye to eye.

612
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,996
So if I prepare for rain, then it won't.

613
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,035
So far, so good.

614
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:06,112
I'm Hardy and I'm spending the
afternoon in the Wren Library.

615
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,756
Now we're sure
to have sunshine.

616
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,916
You see, I'm what you call an atheist.

617
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,154
No, sir. You believe in God.

618
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,639
You just don't think He likes you.

619
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,748
Oh, really?

620
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,519
Listen...

621
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,629
I wasn't gonna...

622
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,150
Give you this just yet,
but I took the liberty of doing some of

623
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,437
your proofs myself.

624
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,958
Just to show you
what together we can achieve.

625
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,829
See?

626
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,634
You've been published.

627
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,873
Mr. Hardy, thank you!

628
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,399
Thank you, sir!

629
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,550
It is with great pride
that today all of us have shared

630
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,560
the publication of my son's article

631
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,320
in the London Mathematical Society.

632
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,671
Such a big thing.
A very prestigious society.

633
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,433
So how really is the little genius?

634
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,839
Don't pay attention to her.

635
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,789
She's not proud enough
of his achievements. Huh?

636
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,959
Ramanujan?

637
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,354
Wake up. It just
came over the wire. We're at war.

638
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,036
- Here?
- No, silly, Belgium.

639
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,838
Now, come on! The King's arriving!

640
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,952
God save the King!

641
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,998
Bloody jingoes.

642
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,114
Bertie's asked me to help him

643
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,556
with his Union of
Democratic Control or something.

644
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,755
Hmm, agitating already?

645
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,909
Well...

646
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,831
Well, I received a letter from the
War Office this morning.

647
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,229
Seems they need
some assistance with ballistics.

648
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,553
- Ballistics? You?
- I know.

649
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,473
I did try to explain,
but they're rather a dense lot.

650
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,591
- Yeah.
- Anyway, you probably won't miss me.

651
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,874
There's an ongoing theory

652
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,696
that I'm merely a figment
of your imagination.

653
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,800
That's not true.

654
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,632
Ah, Ramanujan's out there.

655
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,948
There's a reason
he doesn't like proofs, you know.

656
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,594
They may be
disagreeable to his formulas.

657
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,115
God save the King!

658
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,280
How do you mean?

659
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,679
Well, I've been having some
reservations about some of his work.

660
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,760
Oh.

661
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,909
Well, what did you expect?

662
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,231
He may belong to
a world beyond us, but he's not God.

663
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,719
Well, that's a relief.

664
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,273
He's not.

665
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,033
How will Janaki ever come now?

666
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,309
Don't worry.
They say it'll be over by Christmas.

667
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:21,231
Please finish by telling him
that, of course, I will come

668
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:26,035
and not to worry
about the war. It is far away from here.

669
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,479
And that I will wait for him to make
the necessary arrangements.

670
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,678
Also that I love him very much.

671
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,835
That is all.

672
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,835
Make your mark here.

673
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,151
I knew your husband.

674
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,478
But he spent all the time at the temple.

675
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,074
He's still there in the alcove.

676
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,274
<i>Amma?</i>

677
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,478
<i>Amma,</i> please, would you
post this for him?

678
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,154
Hmm?

679
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,354
He needs to know
I will still come with the war.

680
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,638
<i>Amma,</i> please let me help you.

681
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,154
Where are all the vegetables?

682
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,719
Rationing for the war.

683
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,878
- And some... Thank you.
- Hmm.

684
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,598
<i>There is no letter for you.</i>

685
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,677
Please, can you check again?

686
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,393
I already looked again.

687
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,993
Now, you're holding up the queue.

688
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,511
His mum forgot to write him.

689
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,069
Look who it is, the genius wog!

690
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,558
Can you believe they send us
off while he kips here in luxury?

691
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,868
Oi! Where do you think you're going?

692
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,717
You freeloading little blackie.

693
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,159
Hey. Hey.

694
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,559
I'm talking to you.

695
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,869
Hey.

696
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,872
This is our home.

697
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,433
Don't you forget it.

698
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,033
Victory at any price?

699
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,833
Victory for whom?

700
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,152
I understand it's inevitable

701
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,834
that anybody primarily
interested in peace

702
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:52,708
should be unpopular in a time of war.

703
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:59,073
But perhaps that is
all the more reason that we should exist.

704
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,191
Hear, hear.

705
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,518
Mr. Littlewood has
very kindly offered us his rooms

706
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,916
while he is away
solving the intricacies of ballistics

707
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,112
for which he is so ill-suited.

708
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,275
So please keep your hands off my books.

709
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,351
By that he means his whiskey collection.

710
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,912
Thank you all very much for coming.

711
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,878
Bless you.

712
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,230
Thank you so much.
Thank you for coming.

713
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,759
Bloody cheek!

714
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,597
...were so fast and ours
were in completely the wrong position.

715
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,913
What is the meaning of this?

716
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,035
I'd have thought
you'd choose your battles more wisely.

717
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,616
After all, it's
only the goodwill of the college

718
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,039
that allows Ramujin here.

719
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,789
What the bloody hell does the UDC have
to do with Ramanujan?

720
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,313
You should know that your friend,

721
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,776
Russell, is going to lose his lectureship

722
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,576
as a result of the leaflets
he's been distributing.

723
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,114
We have heard that others
are doing the same.

724
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,628
Are you threatening me?

725
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:07,150
Mr. Howard is simply
trying to enlighten you

726
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,710
as to the
precariousness of your situation.

727
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,031
You are perfectly at liberty to take

728
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,997
the matter to the College Council.

729
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,436
Well, rest assured, I shall, on principle.

730
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,016
Well, that's a rather dangerous word,

731
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,395
with all your liberal colleagues in France.

732
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,800
Change, Hardy. That's what you wanted.

733
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,273
Now you get used to it.

734
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,030
From Mr. Littlewood, sir.

735
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,991
If I may,
he's so misplaced on a battlefield,

736
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,469
I shouldn't think
a bullet would recognize him as a target.

737
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:51,715
Hmm.

738
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,679
Damn you, Littlewood.

739
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,148
<i>My dear Harold,</i>

740
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,679
<i>please forgive
this personal transgression.</i>

741
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,477
<i>I'm gone now to this god-awful war</i>

742
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,433
<i>and haven 't the faintest idea
if I will ever return.</i>

743
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:22,474
<i>Fortunately, unlike you,
I do have God to take comfort in.</i>

744
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,833
<i>I have two points to make.</i>

745
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,915
<i>The first is
that Ramanujan's work on primes,</i>

746
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:33,676
<i>while brilliant in itself,
is actually wrong.</i>

747
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,115
<i>The other point is less straightforward.</i>

748
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,835
<i>You have in Ramanujan
nothing short of a miracle.</i>

749
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,033
<i>The man exceeds any notion of brilliance</i>

750
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,678
<i>that I have ever understood.</i>

751
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,110
<i>Forget Jacobi,
we can compare him with Newton.</i>

752
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,149
<i>I have come to believe</i>

753
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,835
<i>that for Ramanujan,
every single positive integer</i>

754
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,791
<i>is one of his personal friends.</i>

755
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:01,875
<i>And, to that end,
you, too, have a responsibility.</i>

756
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,879
<i>You have to look after him</i>

757
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,754
<i>and make sure that his work
amounts to something.</i>

758
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,271
<i>Don't let Howard and his lot win.</i>

759
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:13,316
<i>So, you see, Hardy,
you, too, have a war to fight.</i>

760
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,715
<i>Just don't let it be with Ramanujan.</i>

761
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,356
So, there you have it.

762
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,711
He left this for you to see for yourself.

763
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,191
Your theorem on primes is wrong.

764
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,629
It's not. It can't be.

765
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,199
It's rather interesting, really.

766
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,794
If you compare
the prime number approximation

767
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,200
with the actual number of primes,

768
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,520
the calculation tells us what?

769
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,595
It always moves higher.

770
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,714
Even at a thousand? A million?

771
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,154
A billion trillion?

772
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,189
Yes?

773
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,512
Where is the proof?

774
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,477
I gave it to you. It proves it.

775
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,757
No, because
however intuitively obvious it may seem,

776
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,030
when subject to calculation, it fails.

777
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,391
Mr. Littlewood has calculated a number

778
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:04,678
and it shows that your theorem
will sometimes predict less,

779
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,115
not more,
than the actual number of primes.

780
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,077
Your theorem is wrong.

781
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,593
And this is why
we cannot publish anymore

782
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:16,593
until you finally
trust me on this business of proofs.

783
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,036
Intuition can only carry you so far.

784
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,473
Stop!

785
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,550
I... I can't hear this anymore.

786
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,189
Intuition?

787
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,151
You say this word as if it is nothing.

788
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,954
Is that all it is to you? All that I am?

789
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,476
Look, I'm sorry.
Am I... I'm missing something.

790
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,636
You've... You've never even seen me,

791
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,794
let alone know me.

792
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,428
You... You are a man of no faith!

793
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,272
I don't see pictures of anyone here!

794
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,237
Not even family!
Who are you, Mr. Hardy?

795
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,469
How dare you...

796
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,959
How dare you judge me?

797
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,951
But it is you
who does of me! Don't you see?

798
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:55,589
No.

799
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,799
Quite frankly, I don't!

800
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,750
Don't you know
what I've given up to be here?

801
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,433
I have nothing.

802
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,155
Do you even see the bruises on my face?

803
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,316
I have a wife, Mr. Hardy.

804
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:53,714
Ah.

805
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,434
At last.

806
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:06,235
Ramanujan? Is that you?

807
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,029
Mr. Hardy.

808
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:11,909
You're not well?

809
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:13,829
Nothing serious.

810
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,355
Sure?

811
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,595
Oh.

812
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,759
I'm just off to the Wren.

813
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,308
Believe it or not,

814
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,776
if you can find your way round the beds,

815
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,279
there are still some books there.

816
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,633
Those proofs you left...

817
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,915
Wonderful.

818
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,434
Really wonderful.

819
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,835
So, we start work again?

820
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:40,755
Tomorrow morning?

821
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,831
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

822
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,713
My regards to your fine wife.

823
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,119
Thank you so much.

824
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,388
Good day, gentlemen.

825
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,073
I'm very sorry, sir.

826
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,359
He was a fine young man.

827
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:05,953
Best... Best of his year.

828
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,439
They were all fine young men.

829
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,790
All the knowledge they gained here.

830
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,273
Sacrificed for a few yards of land.

831
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:16,396
They say it's the price of victory. Hmm?

832
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:23,669
Come, Bertie.

833
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,275
I'm worried about Ramanujan.

834
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,075
Why?

835
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,515
Well, he doesn't seem quite himself.

836
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,838
What would you know about that?

837
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,473
Very little, I admit.

838
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,679
But I don't think he's well.
He seems to have changed.

839
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:53,557
We had a terrible row the other night

840
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:57,792
about intuition,
of all things, and he stormed out.

841
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:01,156
And then a day later he
produces these wonderful proofs.

842
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,712
Well, Harold, you've got your way.

843
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,434
How do you mean?

844
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:10,030
You and your damned
rigor has finally broken his spirits.

845
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,832
I warned you to let him run.

846
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,616
Yeah, well, he's not a bloody racehorse.

847
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,868
No, he's not.

848
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,757
But as you've hardly treated him as
a human being, I suppose...

849
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,519
Well, I suppose a horse
isn't a bad place to start.

850
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,073
Major, can I have a word?

851
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,919
I don't have time for you!

852
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,228
Partitions!

853
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,433
It's Ramanujan.

854
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,674
The gall.

855
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:28,514
The unbridled arrogance.

856
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,477
He won't be able to do it without you.

857
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:35,074
He won't be able to do it at all.

858
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,917
I've been going over
your work on partitions.

859
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,479
Seems to me you're
on the verge of a major breakthrough.

860
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,917
So now you've
begun to embrace some proper rigor...

861
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,195
I think you should
meet Major MacMahon.

862
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,919
He's the leader
in combinatorics at the University and...

863
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:17,636
Also happens to be
one of your most vocal opponents.

864
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:21,070
He says partitions can't be done.

865
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,191
Especially by the likes of you.

866
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,836
Then he better start counting very high.

867
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,633
Enter at your own risk!

868
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,355
Ah.

869
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,236
I've been waiting for you.

870
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,910
Square root of 58,639? Now!

871
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,109
242.

872
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,519
242 what?

873
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:52,317
Point 1549090.

874
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,472
Yes, child's play. Try me.

875
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,796
Go on.

876
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,148
Same number squared.

877
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:08,792
3,438,532,321.

878
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,871
Ha! Thrashed ya!

879
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,638
Combinatorics, that's what I do.

880
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,233
Glorified dice throwing.

881
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,549
Bloody nerve of you both.

882
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:21,634
You fail on primes,

883
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,752
then you think you can just turn
round and crack partitions?

884
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,911
Can't be done, I'm telling you.

885
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,838
Especially not by you.

886
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:30,915
It can.

887
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,675
And I will.

888
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:37,275
No, I will.

889
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:38,795
By hand.

890
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,075
By slow and painful addition,

891
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,071
and then you can be absolutely certain

892
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:47,392
that whatever formula you two can dream
up will be quite wrong.

893
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:51,669
Then you can crawl back under whatever
rock you came from in India

894
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,479
and we can put
to bed this charade of yours, Hardy.

895
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,352
Now, how high do I have to go?

896
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,632
P of 200 should do.

897
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,469
I really can do it.

898
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,790
Well, here we are, P of 200.
The moment of truth.

899
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,108
You know, I was stationed
in Madras once.

900
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,349
Yeah.

901
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:58,788
Well, you first.

902
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,272
What has your formula given you?

903
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:09,038
3,972,998,000,000.

904
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,475
My God.

905
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:14,954
You're close.

906
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,589
Within 2%.

907
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:25,078
Well, I'll be damned.

908
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:29,316
Major MacMahon, may I introduce you

909
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,997
to Mr. Ramanujan.

910
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,433
How long?

911
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,314
Three weeks.

912
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,277
Mmm-hmm. And the fever?

913
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,113
- Longer.
- Breathe in.

914
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:21,508
Breathe in.

915
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,196
Well, it's not good.

916
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,874
You've all the early signs of tubercula.

917
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:31,349
I'm sorry.

918
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:34,390
You're a breeding ground for infection.

919
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,633
I'm so sorry, Ramanujan.

920
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:43,793
Hardy can never know.

921
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:49,832
Run! Run!

922
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,234
It's a zeppelin!

923
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,480
Come on, Ram!

924
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,758
Over here!

925
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:12,994
I'm being punished.

926
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,149
It's just the fever.

927
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,589
Has he wrote yet?

928
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:50,749
No.

929
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,034
Where are you going?

930
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,148
You forgot me.

931
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,197
You see, you were right.

932
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,713
Cauchy's theorem will work.

933
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:28,071
It's just leading to the circle concept.

934
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,235
At 2,000, it should bring it down to...

935
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,997
Less than 1% or so.

936
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,958
And as N goes to infinity...

937
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,193
The error goes to zero.

938
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:48,352
You see? You're beginning to
see the nuances and complexities,

939
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:50,874
which you were
only catching at a glance before.

940
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,309
What an unlikely team we make.

941
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:59,998
If we really crack partitions, this will be
a monumental breakthrough.

942
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,231
Did I tell you I've...
I've put you up for a Fellowship?

943
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,269
Mr. Hardy,

944
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:20,629
thank you.

945
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,239
Are you getting enough to eat?

946
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:35,559
I mean, I know there are shortages,

947
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,631
but there's still plenty
of good grub in Hall.

948
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,115
I'm all right.

949
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:43,469
It's nothing.

950
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,029
Let me ask you something.

951
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,752
How does all this come to you?

952
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,235
I don't know.

953
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,309
Why am I bothering
with a Council meeting

954
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:06,549
when I'm getting the boot?

955
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,416
If you think I'm gonna have
that charlatan for a Fellow,

956
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,759
you're very much mistaken.

957
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,955
Oh, please tell me
you didn't propose him.

958
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,116
- He's gonna crack partitions.
- Oh.

959
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,349
He's worthy.

960
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,668
You're the one who told me

961
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:23,320
to let him run
like a damn horse. Well, I did.

962
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,838
And now I... I need to raise his spirits.

963
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,468
You mean you need
to relieve your own guilt.

964
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:36,877
Really, for someone so clever,
you can be so terribly dim.

965
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:42,234
So, in the matter
of Fellowship for Srinivasa Ramanujan,

966
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:43,992
we call the matter to vote.

967
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,078
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

968
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,080
I felt I should be the one to tell you.

969
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:07,433
I'm very embarrassed,
for myself and for the College.

970
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:11,397
But your Fellowship was denied.

971
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,228
Thank you for telling me.

972
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,114
I know you did all you could.

973
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,513
Yeah, more dressings!

974
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:39,358
Can we have
someone over here, please?

975
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:45,108
Nurse!

976
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,719
Nurse!

977
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:53,359
That's it, just breathe.

978
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:04,949
Ramanujan?

979
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:08,549
Nurse! Nurse!

980
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:13,554
Shall I wake him?

981
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,229
No.

982
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,598
He'll come when he's ready.

983
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,953
Excuse me, Doctor.

984
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,190
This gentleman's
looking for the Indian student.

985
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,159
Ah, yes.

986
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,396
He came in last night.

987
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:46,914
Not right in the head.

988
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,559
Terrible fever.

989
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:52,959
He was here.

990
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,518
<i>Your condition has worsened.</i>

991
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,512
<i>You may not have long.</i>

992
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,710
<i>You should set your affairs in order.</i>

993
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,673
<i>Do you have any family here?</i>

994
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:29,829
<i>Anyone?</i>

995
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:06,709
No!

996
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,752
Sir, something's happened in London.

997
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,479
Call me a taxi, will you?

998
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,632
He was very
lucky with the train.

999
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:23,070
The conductor saw him
before he jumped.

1000
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,632
The danger is his lungs.

1001
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:28,031
Yes, he's had
a bad cough for some time.

1002
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:29,869
It is no cough.

1003
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,712
He has advanced tuberculosis.

1004
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:42,630
Well, is... Is there nothing we could do?

1005
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,235
Pray.

1006
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:45,713
It will take a miracle.

1007
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:27,108
Mr. Hardy.

1008
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,191
I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused you.

1009
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,268
Gave me quite a scare.

1010
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:42,593
Self-prophesying.

1011
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:45,752
My wife has forgotten me.

1012
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:50,639
I have no one.

1013
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,199
I understand that

1014
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,277
you might feel like that, but...

1015
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,594
You should have told me.

1016
01:22:58,800 --> 01:22:59,994
I could have helped.

1017
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,030
You know,
it just as easily could have been me.

1018
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:40,953
Well, I'm glad it wasn't.

1019
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,795
You have cause enough
with Ramanujan.

1020
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:47,473
I'll be thinking of you both.

1021
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:50,669
Where will you go?

1022
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:52,918
Oh, I'll go down the road to Oxford.

1023
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:59,198
And I'll wait for
them to beg to have me back here.

1024
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:01,035
Hmm.

1025
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,314
Good-bye, Harold.

1026
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:04,829
Bye, Bertie.

1027
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:11,551
Too bad he couldn't take Hardy with him.

1028
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,840
I still don't see what
he bloody contributes.

1029
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,311
Yeah, I had words with Major MacMahon.

1030
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,798
It seems that Ramanujan's on the
verge of a major breakthrough.

1031
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:22,711
That's right. Partitions.

1032
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,711
Oh, that's impossible.

1033
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:27,598
Hmm. Remains to be seen.

1034
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:35,558
God, it's freezing in here.
Are you warm enough?

1035
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:39,953
Try sleeping. I have to go to that
pipe just so I don't freeze.

1036
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,194
It would have been
better for all had the train done its job.

1037
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:48,115
Oh, yeah, you could
have been reincarnated as a pigeon turd.

1038
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,916
Sorry I've not
been able to be a better friend

1039
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,911
to you in the traditional sense.

1040
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:04,999
I know you've needed one,
but I'm not very good at all of that.

1041
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,270
I never have been.

1042
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,074
Life for me is...

1043
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,872
It's always been mathematics.

1044
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:20,276
You wanted to know how I get my ideas.

1045
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:22,909
Mmm.

1046
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:27,395
My God.

1047
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:30,275
Namagiri.

1048
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:32,628
She speaks to me.

1049
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:36,396
Puts formulas on
my tongue when I sleep,

1050
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:38,759
sometimes when I pray.

1051
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:43,429
Do you believe me?

1052
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:48,237
Because if you are my friend,

1053
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:50,280
then you will know
that I'm telling you the truth.

1054
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,478
If you are truly my friend.

1055
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:57,397
But I don't believe in God.
I don't believe in anything I can't prove.

1056
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:58,708
Then you can't believe in me.

1057
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,029
Don't you see?

1058
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,677
An equation has no meaning to me

1059
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:07,630
unless it expresses a thought of God.

1060
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,594
Maybe it is better
that we just remain what we were.

1061
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:23,993
When I was at school,
I remember one of my chaplains saying,

1062
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:28,438
"You know God exists
because He's like a kite,

1063
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:31,671
"and you can feel the tug on the
string and know that He's up there."

1064
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,993
I said, "What if there's no
wind and the kite can't fly?"

1065
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:42,117
No, I... I can't believe in God.

1066
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:47,316
I don't believe
in the immemorial wisdom of the East,

1067
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,470
but I do believe in you.

1068
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,109
Thank you.

1069
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:00,355
I very much want to
finish what we started.

1070
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,035
Good.

1071
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:08,829
I brought some calculations
in case you were feeling a bit better.

1072
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:11,239
And then I want to go home.

1073
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:14,869
Home?

1074
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,149
As soon as I am able.

1075
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:20,269
Or if I should die, you have to
promise that you will get me home.

1076
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:21,873
You're not going to die.

1077
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:23,873
Oh, this came for you.

1078
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,553
I'll leave you in peace.

1079
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:40,432
Try and do what the doctors ask.

1080
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:41,953
I know it's not in your nature.

1081
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,233
<i>I will never know
why you have chosen to forsake me.</i>

1082
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,233
<i>Just a letter in response</i>

1083
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:01,675
<i>to the multitude I have sent
you would have been enough.</i>

1084
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:04,358
<i>I have gone to be with my brother</i>

1085
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:06,078
<i>and his family where I will remain.</i>

1086
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:09,236
<i>This last letter is to say good-bye.</i>

1087
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,998
What happened?

1088
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:46,798
I don't know. He's a terrible patient.

1089
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,871
Doesn't believe
in medicine. Won't eat anything.

1090
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,279
Just prays to his Namagiri.

1091
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:52,216
Well, I'd be praying too
if you were my doctor.

1092
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:53,878
And I'm a bloody atheist.

1093
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:02,431
This is my fault.

1094
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,477
Yes, maybe.

1095
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:22,755
We are within.004.

1096
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:25,676
This can't die with me, Mr. Hardy.

1097
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:29,039
You're not going to die.

1098
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:32,588
If this is correct,

1099
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,077
you'll make a difference.

1100
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:43,599
I have the proofs.

1101
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:48,348
My God.

1102
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:52,439
He did it. He really did it.

1103
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,759
Now he must be a Fellow.

1104
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,952
Oh, be practical, Hardy.

1105
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:58,359
He'll only fail again.

1106
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:01,878
Not with your help, he won't.

1107
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:05,593
Besides, there is another way.

1108
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:07,634
If he was a...

1109
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:10,632
If he had a Royal Fellowship...

1110
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:12,632
- An FRS?
- Mmm.

1111
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:13,994
He's Indian!

1112
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,993
MacMahon, listen to me.

1113
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:23,798
He really needs this.

1114
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:30,235
See that this gets
to Lieutenant Littlewood.

1115
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:33,239
Littlewood? Where?

1116
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,476
Mr. Hobson, Mr. Baker, I have someone

1117
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:39,471
who wishes to talk to you
about Mr. Ramanujan.

1118
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:43,235
Gentlemen.

1119
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:50,158
Trinity denied him.

1120
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:53,399
I just want
the opportunity to make the case.

1121
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:57,154
Try him on his merits.

1122
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:01,030
Suit yourself. But I think you'll
find the result will be the same.

1123
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:11,356
- Hardy.
- Morning.

1124
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:15,956
Now what have you got
yourself involved with?

1125
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:20,948
John.

1126
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:24,354
Good of you to come.

1127
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,038
Wouldn't have missed it for the world.

1128
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:32,715
So, now we see the work on partitions

1129
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:36,913
and the enormous
breakthrough that has been achieved.

1130
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,353
All this, mind you,

1131
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:42,633
by a man whose limitations
of knowledge when I met him

1132
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:45,871
were as startling as was its profundity.

1133
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:51,317
Opinions may differ as to the
importance of Ramanujan's work

1134
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:53,237
and the influence it may or may not

1135
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:55,078
have on the mathematics of the future,

1136
01:31:55,160 --> 01:32:01,554
but one gift it does show
is its profound and invincible originality.

1137
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,630
Mr. Littlewood once told me

1138
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:11,272
that "every positive integer is one
of Ramanujan's personal friends."

1139
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:13,908
I believe this to be true.

1140
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,993
He told me that
an equation for him had no meaning

1141
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:21,436
unless it expressed a thought of God.

1142
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:27,908
Well, despite everything in my
being set to the contrary,

1143
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:30,034
perhaps he is right.

1144
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:36,120
For is this not exactly our
justification for pure mathematics?

1145
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:39,994
We are merely explorers of infinity

1146
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:42,799
in the pursuit of absolute perfection.

1147
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,310
We do not invent
these formulae, they already exist

1148
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:50,156
and lie in wait for only the very

1149
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:52,151
brightest of minds, like Ramanujan,

1150
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:54,800
ever to divine and prove.

1151
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,195
So, in the end,

1152
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:00,717
I have been forced to consider,

1153
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:05,794
who are we to question Ramanujan,

1154
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:10,913
let alone God?

1155
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:16,349
Thank you.

1156
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:42,598
It's bad enough that
this charlatan has wasted our time once.

1157
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:45,393
And now Hardy has dragged
the only person in the world

1158
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:47,277
who will support him out of the trenches.

1159
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:50,591
No, enough is
enough with this... This Ramujin.

1160
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:53,680
Littlewood is not the only one.

1161
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:56,638
I think he has the
finest mind I've seen in my lifetime.

1162
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:59,071
And his name is Ramanujan.

1163
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:10,515
Hardy?

1164
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:51,397
I'm a Fellow of the Royal Society.

1165
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,228
He wrote to me.

1166
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:40,469
Janaki.

1167
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:43,678
If you had gone to him,

1168
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,356
he would never return.

1169
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:04,392
Are you really gonna go home?

1170
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:07,510
War is over. It is time.

1171
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:11,318
Well, as a Fellow of the Royal Society,

1172
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:13,197
they're gonna be really proud of you.

1173
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,278
- I owe you so much.
- No, no, no.

1174
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:17,996
It's I who owe you.

1175
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:34,278
Come on. Come on
the grass. You're late.

1176
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:36,669
But, sir, I can't.
I'm not a Fellow over here.

1177
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,348
Are you sure about that?

1178
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:45,428
Well, as an FRS, what could they say?

1179
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:02,908
Repeat after me.

1180
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:06,516
"I, Srinivas Ramanujan,

1181
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:10,074
"elected Fellow of Trinity College..."

1182
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:15,154
I, Srinivas Ramanujan,

1183
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:19,753
elected Fellow of Trinity College.

1184
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:30,640
Sorry I'm late. Bloody cab driver got lost.

1185
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,393
Should have known from his number.

1186
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:33,595
And what was that?

1187
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:34,829
Rather a dull one.

1188
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,239
1729.

1189
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:37,674
No, Hardy.

1190
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:40,115
It is a very interesting number.

1191
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:42,271
It is the smallest number expressible

1192
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:44,510
as the sum of two cubes
in two different ways.

1193
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,718
Have you notified your family?

1194
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:52,992
Just not her.

1195
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:54,752
I don't even know if she got my letter.

1196
01:37:57,640 --> 01:38:01,110
I... I... I'm rather
out of my depth in such affairs, but...

1197
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:02,873
But I will say this.

1198
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:07,637
There are no proofs nor underlying laws

1199
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:10,757
that can determine
the outcome of matters of the heart.

1200
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:13,391
Of this I'm sure.

1201
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:18,438
Perhaps when we meet again you will
have such matters of your own.

1202
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:20,799
Well, perhaps.

1203
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:25,952
I will miss you, my friend.

1204
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:30,674
I will miss you.

1205
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:44,913
So, I want a letter with you with all
your new work, every week.

1206
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:48,035
And come back to us in a year's time.

1207
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:49,509
I promise.

1208
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,479
Afternoon post, sir.

1209
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:39,988
Thank you.

1210
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:41,428
India.

1211
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:46,434
At last.

1212
01:39:57,880 --> 01:39:59,154
Is he coming back, sir?

1213
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:14,674
It is difficult to put into words...

1214
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:17,119
What I owe

1215
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:19,469
Ramanujan.

1216
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:25,273
His originality has been
a constant source of suggestion to me

1217
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:26,759
ever since I first met him.

1218
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:30,829
And his death

1219
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:38,438
is one of the worst blows I have ever felt.

1220
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:45,000
But now I say to myself
when I'm depressed,

1221
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:47,756
and I find myself forced to listen

1222
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:51,150
to tiresome and pompous people,

1223
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:55,959
"Well, I've done something
you could never have done.

1224
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:03,955
"I have collaborated
with both Littlewood and Ramanujan

1225
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:07,870
"on something like equal terms."

1226
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:00,039
Let's take this one.

1227
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:02,829
What?

1228
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:05,639
1729.

1229
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:08,235
I don't see
what's so special about this one.

1230
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:11,078
Neither did I at first.
