1
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,710
Dan...

2
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,910
Maybe it's the wind.

3
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:56,810
No!

4
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,910
Stop!

5
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,710
Please! Stop!

6
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,010
Tucker!

7
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:13,810
You have a week, Evans.
Then we burn the house.

8
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,410
William?

9
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,510
Hey! William!

10
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,110
Out. Out!

11
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,010
William!

12
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,510
God damn it, William!
William!

13
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,710
God damn it!
Put that down!

14
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,310
- Come here!
- Let go!

15
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,510
Let go!

16
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,210
lt's the last feed we got!

17
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,210
l'll take care of this.

18
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,310
No, you won't.

19
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,910
Herd's over the ridge by now.

20
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,610
You go get cleaned up.

21
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,110
You lied to me, Dan.

22
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,710
You told me we made payments to Hollander.

23
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,610
We did...some.

24
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,210
How do you think
we bought feed, Alice?

25
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,610
Three months water?

26
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,810
Medicine for Mark?

27
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,910
l had a choice between
our family and paying it down.

28
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,210
We're supposed to make
decisions together.

29
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,610
Would you have made it any different?

30
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:40,210
Alice, we can't make it rain together.

31
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,910
Or turn the dust into grass.

32
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,510
Can't stop Hollander from selling
our land to the railroad, either.

33
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,110
lt's too bad the doctors at Essex
saved so much of my leg.

34
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,310
l read that the pension act
pays by the pound now.

35
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,910
Stop looking at me like that.

36
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,410
You gonna tell the marshal
what those men did?

37
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,210
Marshal ain't doing shit.

38
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,210
- William.
- First thing, Mark,

39
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,210
l'm gonna take you boys, and
we're gonna round up the herd,

40
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,410
and then l'm goin' into town.

41
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,510
What are you gonna do in town?

42
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,010
l'm gonna tell Hollander to make this right.

43
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,110
l'm gonna tell him...

44
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,610
to pay for a new barn.

45
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,710
Maybe we should
just shoot him like Will says.

46
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,410
Coach is headed for Bisbee, Boss.

47
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,010
Girded with iron, Pinks on top,

48
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,210
double shotguns,

49
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,210
and a Gatling.

50
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,510
You shoulda let me save the feed.

51
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,610
You gonna hock that?

52
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,410
Someday, William...

53
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,710
you walk in my shoes,
you might understand.

54
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,010
l ain't ever walking in your shoes.

55
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,510
Tracks over here.

56
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,210
Here we go.

57
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,610
- Kenny, here we go.
- Here they come.

58
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,810
Pull that way!

59
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,210
Now that one!

60
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,010
Use the gun.
Don't let 'em get it.

61
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,410
Mark, stay near.

62
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,610
Mark!

63
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,710
God damn!
Giddyap!

64
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,210
Get down. Now!

65
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,710
l got more!
Here l come!

66
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,010
Knock on 'em, Nonnie.
Knock on 'em.

67
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,110
Keep 'em goin'.

68
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,810
Pull up. Pull up.

69
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,710
Pull up!

70
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,310
Morning, Pinkerton.

71
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,910
Name's Charlie Prince.

72
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,710
l expect you heard of me.

73
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,810
Well, l heard of a...

74
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,910
balled-up whore named...

75
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,710
Charlie Princess.

76
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,910
That you, missy?

77
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,010
l hate Pinkertons.

78
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,710
Byron McElroy.

79
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,310
When did your hair
turn all gray, Byron?

80
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,210
Go to hell, Ben Wade.

81
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,910
Well, would you look at all this?

82
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,810
Y'all spared no expense this time, Byron.

83
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,210
l gotta say, though,
it's probably cheaper

84
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,510
just to let me rob the damn thing.

85
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,310
lf you're gonna kill me,

86
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,810
just as soon get to it.

87
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,710
l ain't gonna kill you.

88
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,810
Not like this.

89
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,310
Won't change a thing, lettin' me live.

90
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,110
l'll come for you.

91
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,710
l'd be disappointed if you didn't.

92
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,910
- She's lit!
- She's lit!

93
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,910
All right, boys.

94
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,010
There you go.
lt's full.

95
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,710
All right. There you go.

96
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,110
Come on, give me one.
One more.

97
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,510
l'll ask you
to put down the money.

98
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,310
You step back!
You men step back!

99
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,210
All of you step back right now,
or this man dies!

100
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,310
Not a smart move, friend.

101
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,910
Shit.

102
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,710
He's fast.

103
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,410
Well, Tommy...

104
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,910
it seems that
there was a Pinkerton...

105
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,410
inside that coach
that wasn't quite dead yet.

106
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,910
Now, l know Charlie told you,

107
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,410
because...

108
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,910
we done got but a few rules in this outfit.

109
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,610
And this is what happens
when you put us all at risk.

110
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,610
Mark, look at me.
Look at me.

111
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,310
Keep lookin' at me.
Back up quietly.

112
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,710
Back-- William!

113
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,210
William, look at me.
Back up.

114
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,910
William, look at me.

115
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,610
Morning.

116
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,310
Those are my cattle.

117
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:15,410
l want 'em back.

118
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,710
Careful, rancher,
that's Ben Wade you're talking to.

119
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,010
Well, l need 'em back.

120
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,610
They're all l got.

121
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,310
l don't need your cattle.

122
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,810
But l will be needin' them horses.

123
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:42,610
So you don't go doing nothing... foolish.

124
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,810
Campos.

125
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,810
You'll find them on the road to Bisbee.

126
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,210
Boys.

127
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,310
They're probably
just running late, Mr. Butterfield.

128
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,810
Pinkertons don't run late.

129
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,110
That's why they're paid $18 a day.

130
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,510
Get me on my feet.

131
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,610
l think you're in pretty bad shape, mister.

132
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,810
- You should--
- Just get me on my damn feet.

133
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,810
Mark, William, get me some of them boards.

134
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:28,810
Can l help you?

135
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,510
l think maybe...

136
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,210
a coach headed for here got itself held up

137
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,010
in the canyon about 10 miles back...

138
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,510
God damn it.

139
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,510
...by Mr. Ben Wade himself.

140
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,510
How did you know it was Wade?

141
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,010
lt's been him the last 21 times, Marshal.

142
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,210
l saw a Mexican sharpshooter
and an Apache.

143
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,310
- God damn it. Jesus Christ.
- And l've been told--

144
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,110
Did you see The Hand of God?

145
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,910
- What's that?
- His pistol.

146
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,510
Why the hell didn't
you do something?

147
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,710
They had a lot of weapons, mister...

148
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,710
and they were shootin' bullets.

149
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,710
Let's go. We're wasting time.

150
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,810
Where you from, anyway?

151
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,110
Tom Conrad bought
a thousand head in Mexico.

152
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,910
Hired us to drive 'em in.

153
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,210
Let's go.
Come on, boys.

154
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,910
Something's going on
with the railroad man.

155
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:42,310
Ma'am? Some whiskey for my friends.

156
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,610
Let's go.

157
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,210
- The bar's closed.
- Already?

158
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,310
Here's to the four we lost in battle.

159
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,510
And here's to the boss,

160
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,610
who...

161
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,610
had to say good-bye
to Tommy Darden today.

162
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,810
And that's too bad.

163
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,810
Proverbs 13:3.

164
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,410
''He that keepeth his mouth,

165
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,510
''keepeth his life.

166
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,010
''He that opens his lips too wide

167
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,410
shall bring on his own destruction.''

168
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,910
Amen.

169
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,810
Tommy was weak.

170
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,710
Tommy was stupid.

171
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,410
Tommy is dead.

172
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,910
l'd drink to that.

173
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,410
Sutherland.

174
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,610
Jorgensen.

175
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,310
Campos.

176
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,210
Jackson.

177
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,710
Kinter.

178
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,210
Marshal's only half stupid.

179
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,010
He's gonna be back soon.

180
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,510
They're going across the border.

181
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,210
l won't be far.

182
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,110
l'll wait for you.

183
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,510
All right, Charlie.

184
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,010
l've seen you someplace before.

185
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,110
Have you?

186
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,110
You ever work for
a blind lrishman in Leadville?

187
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,310
l was a singer.

188
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:24,310
The best time l ever had
in my whole life.

189
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,310
What made you quit?

190
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,010
Got to coughing.

191
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,910
Doctor said l should find a drier climate.

192
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:42,510
You know, l spent more money
in that joint than l could tell you.

193
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,310
Do you remember a girl?

194
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,410
Her name was Velvet.

195
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,310
Nobody forgets Velvet.

196
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,010
You look kinda skinny.

197
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,210
l feel skinny.

198
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,310
That's all right.

199
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,310
l don't mind skinny girls.

200
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,810
Long as they got green eyes
to make up for it.

201
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,110
Have you got green eyes?

202
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,610
That's all right.

203
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,210
They don't have to be green.

204
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,910
Do you think they lied?

205
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:58,410
Do you think they stole our horses?

206
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,910
They don't need our shit horses.

207
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,610
Watch your mouth.

208
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,410
l'll take him into town on my own.

209
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,510
You boys go round up the herd.

210
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,410
Don't push them too hard.
l can't afford any more dropping.

211
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:26,910
Mister, we're gonna have to lift you up
to get you on top of that horse.

212
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,710
Here comes the Cavalry.

213
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,010
Do as l said.

214
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,910
ls he from the coach?

215
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,410
Only one who made it.

216
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,510
Mr. McElroy, can you hear me?

217
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,910
lt was Ben Wade.

218
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,010
Mr. McElroy, can you hear me?

219
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,210
Mr. Mc--

220
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,710
This man needs attention.

221
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,510
You see which way he rode, Evans?

222
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,910
Looked like they were headed to Bisbee.

223
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:52,110
You know...

224
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,910
there's a little town
just south of the border...

225
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,510
<i>pretty little pueblucho
down by the river.</i>

226
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:04,410
Folks would pay good money
to hear a white woman sing.

227
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,410
Yeah.

228
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,410
lmagine me shinning
on down to Mexico

229
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,410
with Ben Wade on my arm.

230
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,510
l'm not wanted in Mexico.

231
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,810
Jump out that back window with me now.

232
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,610
You're crazy.

233
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:33,910
You the doctor?

234
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,110
Yes.

235
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,410
Coach got held up.

236
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,210
Get him on the table.

237
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:49,210
- What's his name?
- Byron McElroy.

238
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,710
He's a bounty hunter
under contract with the Pinkertons.

239
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,210
You've lost a lot of blood, Mr. McElroy.

240
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,010
That bullet's still in there.

241
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,010
Well, get it out.

242
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,010
All right.

243
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,710
Now, what l'm about to do
is gonna hurt like a son of a bitch.

244
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,510
Ain't the first time l been shot.

245
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,710
Hold him, please.

246
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,510
Don't touch me.

247
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,310
All right.

248
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:19,310
What the fuck kind
of doctor are you, anyway?

249
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:22,010
lt's nice to have a conversation
with a patient for a change.

250
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,410
You see anything down there?

251
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,710
Marshal.
Wade's horse.

252
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,710
Take the back.
We'll take the front.

253
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,610
What the hell are they looking for?

254
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,610
Ben Wade.

255
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,310
He held up the payroll coach.

256
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,010
l want to talk, Mr. Hollander.

257
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,710
Ben Wade in Bisbee.

258
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:04,910
Shit.

259
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,810
We're movin' up.

260
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,210
Mr. Hollander?

261
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,010
Tucker, go on to the saloon.

262
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,010
You got no right
to do what you done.

263
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,110
You hear me?

264
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:14,910
That's my land.

265
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,710
Come next week it's not, Evans.

266
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:19,310
You borrowed a good deal of money
and l got rights to recompense.

267
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,110
But you dammed up my creek.
You shut off my water.

268
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,210
How'd you expect me
to pay off my debts if you can't--

269
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,210
Before the water touches your land,

270
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,410
it resides and flows on mine.

271
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:32,310
And as such, l can do with it
as l fuckin' please.

272
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,010
Go home and pack up.

273
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,810
Can you--

274
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,710
Can you just
let me get to spring?

275
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,510
l can turn the corner.

276
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:50,810
Sometimes a man has to be
big enough to see how small he is.

277
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,510
Railroad's coming, Dan.

278
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,310
Your land's worth more with you off it.

279
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,210
Hollander!

280
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,310
You look a little bent, rancher.

281
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,210
You come to wake some snakes?

282
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,510
Dan, would you like a drink?

283
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,010
No, thanks.

284
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,710
You got your horses back, didn't you?
And your cattle?

285
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,710
Yeah, l got my horses back.

286
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,210
But you killed two of my herd.

287
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,510
Well, they died for a good cause.

288
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,510
You know...

289
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:19,210
them beeves of yours,

290
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,210
they wouldn't even have fed a hungry dog.

291
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,510
l tell you what.

292
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,310
That should cover it.

293
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,810
How much you get for a day's work?

294
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,710
$2 when l hire out.

295
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,510
Well, there are $2 for a half a day.

296
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,210
You took up my boys' time, too.

297
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,910
You're right, l did.

298
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:05,010
Anything else you wanna get paid for, Dan?

299
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:10,410
You can give me $5 extra.

300
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:14,210
And what's that for?

301
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,310
For making me nervous.

302
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:20,610
Hands up, Ben Wade.

303
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,510
Boss! Boss!

304
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,110
Hey, Boss!

305
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:29,210
Gimme your hands, Mr. Wade.

306
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,610
- Tucker, take his gun.
- Gimme that.

307
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,110
Ben Wade...

308
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,110
captured in Bisbee.

309
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:45,010
Be careful with that thing.
That gun's got a curse on it.

310
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:51,510
- Laugh while you can.
- Crawley, go get the wagon.

311
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,510
Make sure every weapon we got
is shoot-ready.

312
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:56,410
l'll meet you out front of the office.

313
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,010
We gotta get him outta here.

314
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,610
Sure thing.

315
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,910
l think we should shoot him right now.

316
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,610
Put a bullet right in his noggin.

317
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,810
Do that...

318
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,610
everybody in this
shit-piss little town

319
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,710
will be dead by morning.

320
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,410
22 robberies.

321
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,610
Over $400,000 in losses.

322
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,210
More in delays.

323
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:32,010
The Southern Pacific will have Ben Wade
convicted in a federal court.

324
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:35,810
Hanged in public.

325
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,110
An example made.

326
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,710
And we will pay to make it happen.

327
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:43,510
Y'all notice he didn't mention
any of the lives l've taken.

328
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,310
l need three more men.

329
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:46,710
You can have Tucker.

330
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:47,710
Good.

331
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,010
l'm coming.
You only need one.

332
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,510
You're wounded, Mr. McElroy.

333
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,910
l rode in here.
Sure as hell can ride out.

334
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,310
He goes, Potter's coming.

335
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,910
What?

336
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,310
Doc can't shoot shit.

337
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,810
l was best shot in my regiment.

338
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,410
l'll come...

339
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,210
for $200.

340
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,110
You fight for the North or the South?

341
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,510
North.

342
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,410
We're Southern in name,

343
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,910
but Chicago owned.

344
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,110
Fine. $200.

345
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,510
Let's go.

346
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:40,510
- Thank you.
- Thank me when it's done.

347
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,310
What's goin' on?

348
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,910
This town's gonna burn!

349
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,910
- Let's get him, Mark!
- Cover me!

350
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,710
Shoot!

351
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,310
Get him!

352
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,110
Get in the coach.

353
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,610
God damn it.

354
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:55,910
Evans, Crawley, Tucker,
you need to mount up now.

355
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,610
Head for Evans Ranch.

356
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,310
l'll meet you there with the coach.

357
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,010
How long does he have to be here?

358
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,810
An hour...

359
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,410
to make sure his outfit takes the bait.

360
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:53,110
Hello, there!

361
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:56,110
Evans! Can you give me a hand with this?

362
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,910
Whatever your wife's cooking in there,

363
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,510
it smells good, Evans.

364
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,310
Let's go.

365
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,910
Good driving, Marshal.

366
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,410
Remind me not to play poker
in this town.

367
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,710
All right, Marshal.

368
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,510
Give us a count.

369
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:57,310
One, two, three.

370
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,010
Good luck.

371
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,310
You're gonna check on my family
when you come back, right?

372
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,410
First thing.

373
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,510
Let's go.

374
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,110
Ma'am.

375
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:51,810
Byron...

376
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,610
what an unpleasant surprise.

377
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:58,910
What happens if they
catch the wagon?

378
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:00,010
Well...

379
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,710
you saw where his man was.

380
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,310
He's still gotta go fetch the outfit.

381
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:04,710
Marshal's got a fast rig.

382
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,910
They should reach
the fort before dawn.

383
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:10,110
His gang can't do anything
in front of the whole 6th Cavalry.

384
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,110
Did you have something
to do with that?

385
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:32,410
l hope you're proud of yourself.

386
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,910
Just doin' my job, Doc.

387
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,710
Thanks, son.

388
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,910
We always wait to say grace.

389
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:07,010
We don't presume to teach
other people manners.

390
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,210
Aren't we supposed to say
grace for murderers, too?

391
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:11,610
Grace is for everyone, dear.

392
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,610
- Then why don't we say it?
- Mark.

393
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,610
l'd like to hear it.

394
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:25,410
God our Father, Lord, and Savior,
thank You for Your love and favor.

395
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:28,210
Please bless this drink
and food, we pray.

396
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:31,310
Bless all who shares with us today.

397
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,410
Amen.

398
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,910
Amen.

399
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:35,910
Amen.

400
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:39,110
lf my pa wants to, he could shoot you dead.

401
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:41,810
He can shoot a jackrabbit at 50 yards.

402
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,610
Shooting an animal's a lot different

403
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:46,810
than, uh, shooting a man, son.

404
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,710
No, it isn't.

405
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:52,710
Not in my opinion.

406
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,510
We could ask Byron here.

407
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:59,110
Now, Byron, he's killed dozens of people:

408
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:02,110
men and women and children,

409
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,310
miners, Apache.

410
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:06,610
Not a soul taken
didn't deserve what it got.

411
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:13,510
Every way of man is right
in his own eyes, Byron.

412
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:15,110
The Lord ponders the heart.

413
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:19,410
Proverbs 21 .

414
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:36,110
Dan.

415
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:45,410
You eat more when you're
nervous, Mr. Butterfield?

416
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:48,210
Oh, why, thank you, Dan.

417
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:50,110
That would be pleasant
and kind of you.

418
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,210
Much appreciated.

419
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:54,510
You can cut that up for me.

420
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:56,110
Oh, can you cut the fat off there?

421
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,710
l don't particularly like the fat at all.

422
00:43:57,810 --> 00:43:59,610
l just...

423
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,310
And the--

424
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:05,510
And the gristle.

425
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,610
l don't like the gristle.

426
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:15,810
You mind if l ask you how you got
that hitch in your step, Dan?

427
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:18,210
Don't tell him nothing, Mr. Evans.

428
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:24,110
Where were you stationed?

429
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:29,910
Second Company Sharpshooters
out of Lynnfield, Massachusetts.

430
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:38,710
My father was defending the U.S. capitol
in the District of Columbia.

431
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:39,910
ls that so?

432
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,810
Well, Dan,

433
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:44,210
tell me the story
of how you lost your leg.

434
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:47,010
Did it get shot off, cut off?

435
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:49,510
The lndians steal it?

436
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:02,910
There's something moving
out there in the grass.

437
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,610
There ain't nothing.

438
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:20,710
l think l saw something over the ridge.

439
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:23,510
What if they caught
the coach already?

440
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:25,910
What if they already know
it's Crawley inside?

441
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:32,810
You ever been to San Francisco?

442
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:36,710
lf it's all right by you, Mr. Wade,

443
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:39,210
l'd rather we not talk.

444
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:42,910
So you've never been to San Francisco.

445
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:44,510
No.

446
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:50,010
l knew a girl there.

447
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:52,710
She was the daughter
of a sea captain.

448
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:56,810
She had the most
beautiful green eyes,

449
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:59,910
about the greenest eyes l ever saw.

450
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:08,210
Like yours.

451
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:13,110
And l'd stare deep into them.

452
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,310
They'd just change color in front of me.

453
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,610
All the colors of the sea.

454
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:28,810
What did you say your name was again?

455
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:30,810
Alice?

456
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:37,010
Alice.

457
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:46,110
For God's sake.

458
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:48,010
He's killed more men
than the drought.

459
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:50,110
He's not what l expected.
He's--

460
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:51,510
He's dangerous.

461
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:53,710
Dangerous is what he is, Alice.

462
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:56,310
l don't want you or the boys talking to him.

463
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:01,210
You can change your mind, Dan.

464
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:03,810
No one will think less of you.

465
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:07,710
No one can think less of me.

466
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:11,610
Six months from now,

467
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:14,010
everything's going to be green.

468
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:16,410
The cows are going to be fat.

469
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:21,510
We might even see the steam
from the train coming over the ridge.

470
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:24,510
We'll be all right.

471
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:28,210
But we won't make it
through the next six days

472
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:30,610
if l don't do this.

473
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,210
Sorry, Dan.

474
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:37,910
McElroy says five minutes.

475
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:52,310
You think he's too much for me?

476
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:56,910
He's a killer, Daniel.

477
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:00,210
Then someone ought
to have the decency

478
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,810
to bring him to justice.

479
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:09,110
What are you thinking?

480
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:12,710
l'm not out there alone, you know.

481
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:14,110
Have a little faith in me.

482
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:17,210
Ben Wade has a gang,

483
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,810
and they're out there tonight somewhere.

484
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:23,310
lf l don't go, we got
to pack up and leave,

485
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:24,710
and God knows where,

486
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:26,110
without a prayer, dirt-poor.

487
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:27,710
Now l'm tired, Alice.

488
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:30,710
l am tired of watching
my boys go hungry.

489
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:32,910
l'm tired of the way
that they look at me.

490
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:36,110
l'm tired of the way that you don't.

491
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:39,810
l've been standing on one leg

492
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:41,810
for three damn years,

493
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:43,810
waiting for God to do me a favor.

494
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:48,710
And He ain't listening.

495
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:52,010
Mr. Evans.

496
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:05,210
Oh, no, no, no, no.

497
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,910
This is my horse now.

498
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:12,910
Come on over here.

499
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,710
Come on.

500
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:22,910
Don't you be any trouble, Mark.

501
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:24,710
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

502
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:29,510
William.

503
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:31,110
l want to come with you.

504
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:32,410
Well, you can't.

505
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:33,610
l could help.

506
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:35,010
You're 1 4 years old.

507
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:37,210
Look, l can ride faster and shoot better

508
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:38,910
than any one of them.

509
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,410
The Pinkerton's hurt,
Potter's no good,

510
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:43,210
that railroad man's dead weight,

511
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:44,510
and that other bastard--

512
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:45,610
William.

513
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:47,110
l don't have time to argue.

514
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:49,910
l need you here.
That's that.

515
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:51,510
That's that.

516
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:59,710
So, boys, where are we headed?

517
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:01,910
Ain't none of your business
where we're headed, Wade.

518
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:03,610
You're a prisoner.

519
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:06,710
You don't speak,
you don't piss,

520
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:09,910
you don't goddamn breathe
unless we say so.

521
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,710
You understand that?

522
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:17,410
We're taking you to Contention.

523
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:20,810
Putting you on the 3:10 to Yuma
day after tomorrow.

524
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:22,810
You shouldn't have told him that.

525
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:25,910
Relax, friend.

526
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:28,810
Now if we get separated,
l know where to meet up.

527
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:35,110
l'd like to thank you
for your hospitality, ma'am.

528
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:37,910
Hope l can send
your husband back all right.

529
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:15,110
What did Ben Wade mean
about sending Pa back all right?

530
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:17,110
Was he saying he was gonna kill him?

531
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:19,410
Ben Wade don't have to lift a finger.

532
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,810
His gang will do it for him.

533
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:27,010
Your father can take care of himself.

534
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:14,210
So...

535
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:17,510
were you conscripted
into Lincoln's army, Mr. Evans,

536
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:18,910
or did you volunteer?

537
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,510
Neither.

538
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:24,010
Maybe both.

539
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:26,610
What does that mean?

540
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,710
Means l was a volunteer

541
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:30,810
in the Massachusetts State Guard.

542
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:33,010
Then, in '62,

543
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:35,210
the federal government
was running low on men,

544
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:37,410
so they called in the state militias

545
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:39,710
to protect Washington.

546
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:41,910
And that's when you got hurt.

547
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:48,710
What are you doing out here, Dan?

548
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:52,010
You got a family to protect.

549
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:53,410
You're not a lawman.

550
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:54,910
You don't work for the railroad

551
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:57,110
like Mr. Shiny Shoes over there.

552
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:58,810
You're not a Pinkerton.

553
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:03,710
Maybe l don't like the idea
of men like you on the loose.

554
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:07,510
lt's man's nature
to take what he wants, Dan.

555
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:09,710
That's how we're born.

556
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:13,910
Well, l make an honest living.

557
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:17,710
lt might be honest,
but l don't think it's much of a living.

558
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:20,310
You must be hurting bad
for money to take this job.

559
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:24,410
Go to sleep.

560
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:31,410
l imagine debt puts
a lot of pressure on a marriage.

561
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,410
You imagine?

562
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,410
What would you know about marriage?

563
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:39,910
We can't all be cutthroats and thieves.

564
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:43,010
l know if l was lucky enough
to have a wife like Alice,

565
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:45,610
l'd treat her a whole lot
better than you do, Dan.

566
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:49,010
l'd feed her better,
buy her pretty dresses,

567
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:51,810
wouldn't make her work so hard.

568
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:56,910
Yeah, l'll bet Alice was a real pretty girl
before she married you.

569
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:59,110
Shut up about my wife.

570
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:00,810
You shut up about her.

571
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:02,110
You say one more word,

572
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:05,110
and l'll cut you down right here.

573
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:06,410
Right here.

574
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:10,110
l like this side of you, Dan.

575
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:12,110
Mr. Evans.

576
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:17,110
Okay.

577
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:21,410
lt's my watch now.

578
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:57,210
They're gonna hang me
in the mornin'

579
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:00,710
Before the night is done

580
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:04,910
They're gonna hang me
in the mornin'

581
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:08,110
l'll never see the sun

582
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:11,710
l suppose it's too much
to ask for a little quiet.

583
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,010
The way l figured it

584
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:17,410
is l'd be asleep
in my own bed right now

585
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:19,510
if it weren't for you.

586
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:21,210
So if l got to be up,

587
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:24,710
well, then, you're damn well
gonna be up with me, too,

588
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:27,610
Ben Wade.

589
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:35,110
They're gonna hang me
in the mornin'

590
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:37,910
Before the night is done

591
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:42,010
Hang me in the mornin'

592
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:46,210
l'll never see the sun

593
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:02,310
Son of a bitch!

594
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:19,210
Enough.

595
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:24,410
Enough!

596
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:26,210
That's enough, McElroy.

597
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:40,610
We have to bury him.

598
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:45,410
Take the time to dig one grave,

599
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:48,210
might as well dig one for yourself.

600
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:52,510
Let's go.

601
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:54,010
Mount up.

602
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:58,810
Gonna hang me in the mornin'

603
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:07,010
l'll never see the sun

604
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:23,610
Don't you worry there, Boss.

605
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:25,610
We're gonna get you
outta there in a second.

606
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:31,810
Charlie!

607
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:41,410
Wait! Wait!

608
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:46,410
Sutherland.

609
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:51,410
Jackson.

610
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:56,610
No.

611
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:01,110
No.

612
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:02,510
Don't do this.

613
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:07,910
Don't do this.

614
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:10,910
- Where is he?
- Open the door.

615
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:12,810
Open the door.
Let me outta here, God damn it.

616
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:15,610
- Where did they take him?
- l don't know.

617
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:21,610
Mister...

618
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:22,910
you better tell me...

619
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:25,410
where they took him...

620
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:26,910
or you will burn.

621
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:34,410
Contention.
All right?

622
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:37,110
They're going to Contention.

623
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:40,510
They're gonna put him
on the 3:10 to Yuma Prison tomorrow.

624
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:46,510
Let me outta here!

625
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:52,310
Contention is...

626
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:55,410
80 miles back the other way.

627
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:57,810
We'd have to about kill our horses.

628
00:59:58,110 --> 00:59:59,372
So we'll buy new ones.

629
00:59:59,511 --> 01:00:00,739
Charlie...

630
01:00:00,879 --> 01:00:03,040
it's his own fault he got caught.

631
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:04,649
He made a mistake.

632
01:00:06,718 --> 01:00:09,243
You think you could do
a better job leading this crew?

633
01:00:09,388 --> 01:00:10,355
Maybe.

634
01:00:17,129 --> 01:00:19,723
You forgotten what he done for us.

635
01:00:26,405 --> 01:00:28,498
We're going to Contention.

636
01:00:40,953 --> 01:00:42,511
Can't say I didn't warn you.

637
01:00:45,257 --> 01:00:47,122
There's a shortcut we could take.

638
01:00:48,293 --> 01:00:49,453
Shortcut?

639
01:00:49,595 --> 01:00:51,028
Through the pass.

640
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:52,461
Takes you right through to Contention.

641
01:00:52,598 --> 01:00:54,463
Why didn't you say something before?

642
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,761
That's Apache country.

643
01:00:56,902 --> 01:00:58,767
I thought the government gave them land.

644
01:00:58,904 --> 01:01:00,064
These are the ones refused to go.

645
01:01:00,172 --> 01:01:01,696
I wouldn't take that pass.

646
01:01:01,807 --> 01:01:03,434
Oh, you'd like us to take the long way?

647
01:01:03,575 --> 01:01:05,873
- That's right.
- And let your boys catch us?

648
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:11,579
Mr. Butterfield, the Apache
that live in that pass

649
01:01:11,683 --> 01:01:13,116
are the ones that stayed to fight.

650
01:01:14,153 --> 01:01:15,211
They enjoy killing.

651
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,788
You ain't gonna make it.

652
01:01:21,593 --> 01:01:23,254
We'll take our chances.

653
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:53,755
Something on your mind, Dan?

654
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:57,519
Why'd you kill Tucker?

655
01:01:57,663 --> 01:01:59,358
Why not me?

656
01:01:59,498 --> 01:02:01,125
Or Butterfield?

657
01:02:01,233 --> 01:02:03,133
Well, Tucker took my horse.

658
01:02:05,737 --> 01:02:07,364
Did you like him, Dan?

659
01:02:07,506 --> 01:02:09,497
No.

660
01:02:09,641 --> 01:02:11,438
He told me he burnt down your barn.

661
01:02:13,178 --> 01:02:14,372
He was an asshole...

662
01:02:16,248 --> 01:02:17,840
but wishing him dead and killing him

663
01:02:17,983 --> 01:02:20,008
are two different things.

664
01:02:20,152 --> 01:02:22,017
Your conscience is sensitive, Dan.

665
01:02:22,154 --> 01:02:24,054
I don't think it's my favorite part of you.

666
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:27,458
Button it up, Mr. Wade.

667
01:02:27,559 --> 01:02:31,359
You wanna talk to somebody,
talk to me.

668
01:02:31,496 --> 01:02:32,793
I don't like talking to you, Byron.

669
01:02:32,898 --> 01:02:34,490
Not when I have the gun.

670
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:35,862
No, that ain't it.

671
01:02:36,001 --> 01:02:38,196
I just don't find you that interesting.

672
01:02:39,404 --> 01:02:40,735
Laugh it up, Doc,

673
01:02:40,872 --> 01:02:42,737
till he guts you like a fish.

674
01:02:42,874 --> 01:02:45,001
Byron's like a song with one note.

675
01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:46,873
You ever read another book
in your life, Byron,

676
01:02:47,012 --> 01:02:48,172
besides the Bible?

677
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,872
No need.

678
01:02:51,016 --> 01:02:53,075
Byron acts pious.

679
01:02:53,218 --> 01:02:56,676
Few years ago, when he was
under contract to Central,

680
01:02:56,788 --> 01:02:59,518
I seen him and a bunch of other Pinks

681
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:02,253
mow down 32 Apache
women and children.

682
01:03:02,394 --> 01:03:04,157
Renegades...

683
01:03:04,263 --> 01:03:06,561
gunning down railroad men
and their families.

684
01:03:06,698 --> 01:03:08,928
Picking 'em off the road one by one.

685
01:03:09,067 --> 01:03:10,193
Scalping 'em.

686
01:03:10,302 --> 01:03:12,566
There was young ones running
around crying and screaming.

687
01:03:12,704 --> 01:03:15,264
No more than three years old.

688
01:03:15,407 --> 01:03:18,274
And his boys shot 'em all
then pushed 'em into a ditch.

689
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:20,002
Some of them was still crying.

690
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:25,509
But I guess Byron figured
that Jesus wouldn't mind.

691
01:03:28,153 --> 01:03:29,780
Apparently Jesus don't like the Apache.

692
01:03:31,723 --> 01:03:34,191
Keep on talking...

693
01:03:34,293 --> 01:03:35,760
all the way to Yuma,

694
01:03:35,894 --> 01:03:37,589
right up them steps,

695
01:03:37,729 --> 01:03:39,060
to the rope,

696
01:03:39,164 --> 01:03:40,461
straight to Hell.

697
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,025
Day I die, Byron,

698
01:03:44,136 --> 01:03:45,865
I'm getting sprung from Hell.

699
01:03:45,971 --> 01:03:47,199
I might feel the same,

700
01:03:47,306 --> 01:03:48,637
if I come from the seed

701
01:03:48,774 --> 01:03:50,867
of a drunk gravedigger

702
01:03:50,976 --> 01:03:53,308
and the rancid womb of a whore.

703
01:04:06,124 --> 01:04:07,489
Drop it, Dan Evans.

704
01:04:07,626 --> 01:04:08,888
Drop it.

705
01:04:08,994 --> 01:04:11,326
Toss that to the ground, Doc.

706
01:04:11,463 --> 01:04:13,260
Mr. Butterfield.

707
01:04:16,635 --> 01:04:18,466
Now I believe, Dan,

708
01:04:18,603 --> 01:04:20,298
you're carrying a pistol as well.

709
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:21,906
I'd appreciate it if you take that out

710
01:04:22,007 --> 01:04:24,237
and drop it on the ground.
Thank you.

711
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:32,144
Now, I always liked you, Byron.

712
01:04:33,785 --> 01:04:35,412
But you never knew
when to shut up.

713
01:04:39,024 --> 01:04:41,686
Even bad men love their mamas.

714
01:04:47,399 --> 01:04:50,527
Now I think it's time
for everybody to go home.

715
01:04:50,669 --> 01:04:52,694
Don't you move, Mr. Wade.

716
01:04:52,838 --> 01:04:55,432
Let go of that shotgun.

717
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:57,007
William...

718
01:04:57,142 --> 01:04:58,871
what the hell
are you doing here?

719
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:01,035
Now, I don't think
you gonna shoot a man

720
01:05:01,179 --> 01:05:02,806
you admire in the back
of the head, boy.

721
01:05:04,816 --> 01:05:08,047
Dan, tell your boy it's over.

722
01:05:08,186 --> 01:05:11,451
You think you can keep
your gun on him, William?

723
01:05:11,556 --> 01:05:14,184
I'm doing a damn sight
better than you did.

724
01:06:01,273 --> 01:06:03,070
You ever been to Dodge City?

725
01:06:07,078 --> 01:06:08,238
No.

726
01:06:09,748 --> 01:06:11,909
Stop talking to him.

727
01:06:15,754 --> 01:06:17,085
The way you're shuffling those cards,

728
01:06:17,222 --> 01:06:19,053
I took you for a pro.

729
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:21,524
I practice a lot.

730
01:06:21,626 --> 01:06:23,685
I can tell.

731
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:32,298
You ever been to Dodge?

732
01:06:32,437 --> 01:06:33,426
Yes, indeed.

733
01:06:34,506 --> 01:06:37,031
Meanest, most beautiful
dirty city there ever was.

734
01:06:37,142 --> 01:06:39,269
Saloon was just overflowing

735
01:06:39,411 --> 01:06:40,969
with cattle drivers, and road agents,

736
01:06:41,112 --> 01:06:42,579
prospectors, gunslingers,

737
01:06:42,681 --> 01:06:44,376
gamblers, and women.

738
01:06:47,252 --> 01:06:50,312
Women who'll do things to you
you'll never forget.

739
01:06:51,156 --> 01:06:53,454
They'll give you a disease you'll never forget.

740
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:55,116
Money in your pocket in Dodge City,

741
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:57,626
you can have everything
a man ever wished for.

742
01:06:59,931 --> 01:07:01,660
Everything a man comes to need.

743
01:07:05,036 --> 01:07:09,063
I got there on my own as a boy
not much bigger than you.

744
01:07:09,174 --> 01:07:12,109
And how many men
you killed since then, Wade?

745
01:07:14,779 --> 01:07:16,838
How many families you destroyed?

746
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:22,916
Quite a few.

747
01:07:25,557 --> 01:07:27,024
Is it true that you dynamited

748
01:07:27,158 --> 01:07:31,424
a wagon full of prospectors
in the Western Territories last spring?

749
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:32,997
No, that's a lie.

750
01:07:33,131 --> 01:07:35,292
It was a train full.

751
01:07:44,476 --> 01:07:46,706
Well, Dan...

752
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,547
I gotta take a piss.

753
01:07:52,684 --> 01:07:54,709
You know, I thought
he was gonna shoot me

754
01:07:54,853 --> 01:07:56,047
back at the ravine.

755
01:07:57,522 --> 01:07:59,046
I really thought
he was gonna do it.

756
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:01,055
You know, there's
a wildness in his eyes.

757
01:08:01,192 --> 01:08:03,490
- It reminds me of...
- He's gonna be nothing like you, Wade.

758
01:08:09,534 --> 01:08:12,332
William's got a head start
on the path of decency.

759
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:16,140
Yeah, that's why I don't mess around

760
01:08:16,241 --> 01:08:18,072
with doing anything good, Dan.

761
01:08:22,347 --> 01:08:25,407
You do one good deed
for somebody...

762
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:27,484
I imagine it's habit-forming.

763
01:08:28,954 --> 01:08:31,218
Something decent.

764
01:08:31,356 --> 01:08:33,221
See that grateful look in their eyes,

765
01:08:33,358 --> 01:08:35,258
imagine it makes you feel
like Christ Hisself.

766
01:08:35,393 --> 01:08:37,520
All right, I had enough
of this, Wade.

767
01:08:37,629 --> 01:08:39,256
Come on, let's go.

768
01:09:08,126 --> 01:09:09,093
William!

769
01:09:33,818 --> 01:09:35,080
- There's three of 'em.
- Yours?

770
01:09:35,186 --> 01:09:37,279
If they were mine, you'd be dead.

771
01:09:40,592 --> 01:09:42,253
Give me that gun, Wade.

772
01:09:44,095 --> 01:09:45,323
Wade?

773
01:09:45,463 --> 01:09:46,452
Wade!

774
01:10:32,911 --> 01:10:35,004
I told you not to come this way.

775
01:10:35,146 --> 01:10:36,545
It was McElroy's decision.

776
01:10:36,681 --> 01:10:39,206
I told you there'd be trouble.

777
01:10:44,155 --> 01:10:46,214
Give me the keys to the handcuffs.

778
01:11:10,281 --> 01:11:11,748
Easy...

779
01:11:13,184 --> 01:11:14,378
Easy now.

780
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,487
Where is he?

781
01:11:16,588 --> 01:11:18,920
He's gone.

782
01:11:21,726 --> 01:11:24,695
He took the horses with him.
I found this in the grass.

783
01:11:30,201 --> 01:11:32,032
What's the quickest way
out of the pass?

784
01:11:32,137 --> 01:11:35,937
He'll be looking for help getting his cuffs off.

785
01:11:37,308 --> 01:11:39,742
We're going after him?

786
01:11:39,878 --> 01:11:41,209
Well, there ain't no reward

787
01:11:41,312 --> 01:11:43,371
for getting him halfway
to that train, is there?

788
01:12:57,121 --> 01:12:58,645
I got to be honest with y'all.

789
01:12:58,790 --> 01:13:00,621
I like some of their food.

790
01:13:00,725 --> 01:13:03,023
As for wanting $40 a month, now,

791
01:13:03,161 --> 01:13:04,958
like them Irish up north...

792
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:08,626
Goddamn Coolies.

793
01:13:08,733 --> 01:13:11,327
They'll work just fine
with my left boot up their ass.

794
01:13:11,469 --> 01:13:13,869
Well, if could teach
a monkey to lay track...

795
01:13:14,005 --> 01:13:16,496
Well, what we need
is some Negroes

796
01:13:16,641 --> 01:13:18,108
brung in here, Mr. Boles.

797
01:13:18,209 --> 01:13:20,973
Show these Chinamen
what real work is.

798
01:13:28,353 --> 01:13:30,685
Holy Christ.

799
01:13:32,323 --> 01:13:35,520
- Who's that?
- That's him.

800
01:13:38,863 --> 01:13:40,797
You, help me with the handcuffs.

801
01:13:43,034 --> 01:13:44,399
Break the chain.

802
01:13:44,535 --> 01:13:47,197
Use the hammer.
Break the chain.

803
01:13:49,607 --> 01:13:52,974
I got five guns on you
out here, Ben Wade!

804
01:13:53,077 --> 01:13:54,567
Best come on out!

805
01:14:13,765 --> 01:14:14,891
Our horses.

806
01:14:37,956 --> 01:14:40,117
What in the hell's going on here?

807
01:14:41,993 --> 01:14:45,190
Mr. Butterfield, all finished in Bisbee?

808
01:14:45,296 --> 01:14:47,355
Mr. Boles.

809
01:14:55,239 --> 01:14:58,640
Better hurry. We're making the last blasts
through the mountains this week.

810
01:14:58,776 --> 01:14:59,970
That's my prisoner.

811
01:15:00,111 --> 01:15:03,046
I'm taking him to Contention,
putting him on the prison train to Yuma.

812
01:15:04,515 --> 01:15:06,312
What prisoner?

813
01:15:06,451 --> 01:15:08,248
Come now, Mr. Boles,

814
01:15:08,353 --> 01:15:09,786
that's Ben Wade you have there.

815
01:15:09,921 --> 01:15:13,220
Ben Wade gunned down my kid brother

816
01:15:13,324 --> 01:15:14,655
in front of me

817
01:15:14,792 --> 01:15:17,158
six years ago in Abilene.

818
01:15:17,295 --> 01:15:19,820
Your brother was a lyin', bilkin' card sharp.

819
01:15:23,501 --> 01:15:26,129
That is, if he's the asshole I remember.

820
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:28,966
Could, of course, been some other
asshole I killed that I forgot about.

821
01:15:44,188 --> 01:15:45,678
You can't do that.
That's immoral.

822
01:15:49,127 --> 01:15:51,027
Moral ain't got a damn thing to do with it.

823
01:15:56,501 --> 01:15:59,868
I was expecting to collect
a $200 reward for that man.

824
01:16:01,806 --> 01:16:03,933
I'm delivering him to Contention.

825
01:16:04,042 --> 01:16:05,771
I need that money.

826
01:16:05,877 --> 01:16:07,936
Need it bad enough to die?

827
01:16:18,189 --> 01:16:21,625
Well, at least let us take our horses.

828
01:16:21,726 --> 01:16:23,887
I got no problem with that...

829
01:16:24,028 --> 01:16:26,519
as long as you ride away, mister.

830
01:16:26,664 --> 01:16:28,655
Nice knowing you, Dan.

831
01:17:10,374 --> 01:17:12,740
Did you see me get that one
with the shovel?

832
01:17:14,212 --> 01:17:15,179
Doc.

833
01:17:15,279 --> 01:17:16,337
Doc!

834
01:17:29,427 --> 01:17:30,860
Dan!

835
01:17:50,114 --> 01:17:51,411
God damn it!

836
01:18:06,597 --> 01:18:08,963
Did we make it?

837
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:11,125
Did we get away?

838
01:18:11,269 --> 01:18:12,258
Yeah, Doc.

839
01:18:13,337 --> 01:18:14,634
We did.

840
01:18:15,806 --> 01:18:16,795
Thanks to you.

841
01:18:41,999 --> 01:18:43,990
We need a place to lay low.

842
01:18:44,135 --> 01:18:46,365
Keep him outta sight
till the train comes.

843
01:18:47,972 --> 01:18:49,997
There's a hotel up here.

844
01:18:50,141 --> 01:18:51,836
I'll check us in.
You ride around back.

845
01:18:51,976 --> 01:18:53,773
All right.
Follow me.

846
01:18:59,083 --> 01:19:00,482
Hello, gentlemen.

847
01:19:02,086 --> 01:19:04,384
Hey, William, you go keep
a watch at the railhead.

848
01:19:04,522 --> 01:19:05,887
If you see them coming...

849
01:19:06,023 --> 01:19:07,490
I'll let you know.

850
01:19:08,826 --> 01:19:09,793
And William?

851
01:19:27,211 --> 01:19:29,907
There's a Can-Can on the hour
if you're interested.

852
01:19:49,133 --> 01:19:51,101
It's the bridal suite.

853
01:19:51,235 --> 01:19:53,203
Hope you don't mind.
It's all they had.

854
01:20:07,885 --> 01:20:09,284
Well, well.

855
01:20:10,154 --> 01:20:12,918
That looks like rain clouds over Bisbee.

856
01:20:14,058 --> 01:20:16,083
You still need that $200, Dan?

857
01:20:16,227 --> 01:20:17,694
Shut up.

858
01:20:19,597 --> 01:20:23,863
Mr. Evans, you continue
to give me great confidence.

859
01:20:23,968 --> 01:20:26,061
Well, it ain't 3:10 yet.

860
01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:28,195
I'm gonna go see about the marshal.

861
01:20:31,942 --> 01:20:33,933
Come on, move.
Let's go.

862
01:20:46,757 --> 01:20:49,783
We're looking for a group escorting an outlaw

863
01:20:49,927 --> 01:20:51,724
by the name of Ben Wade.

864
01:20:51,829 --> 01:20:54,229
Yeah, we been chasing him
through these tunnels.

865
01:20:59,804 --> 01:21:01,465
Who are you?

866
01:21:01,605 --> 01:21:02,799
What's it to you?

867
01:21:04,175 --> 01:21:06,575
Ben Wade killed my brother.

868
01:21:06,677 --> 01:21:08,975
Then your brother must be famous.

869
01:21:10,448 --> 01:21:14,942
You boys some kind of posse?

870
01:21:27,832 --> 01:21:29,766
I hate posses.

871
01:21:37,908 --> 01:21:40,809
So this is the bridal suite.

872
01:21:40,911 --> 01:21:43,436
Now, I wonder how many brides

873
01:21:43,547 --> 01:21:44,673
have taken in this view.

874
01:21:48,919 --> 01:21:51,183
What are you gonna do
with your $200 now, Dan?

875
01:21:51,322 --> 01:21:52,550
Now that the rains are coming?

876
01:21:53,758 --> 01:21:55,953
I owe people money, Wade.

877
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:57,994
That drought left me in the hole.

878
01:22:00,998 --> 01:22:02,898
Well, what do you think
about double that amount?

879
01:22:04,535 --> 01:22:06,560
You could pay your debts,

880
01:22:06,704 --> 01:22:09,172
buy a hundred more cows,

881
01:22:09,273 --> 01:22:10,740
build a new barn.

882
01:22:10,875 --> 01:22:12,740
How you reckon
I'm gonna do that?

883
01:22:15,413 --> 01:22:17,313
Just lay down your gun
and let me walk out the door.

884
01:22:17,415 --> 01:22:19,076
It's worth $400 to me.

885
01:22:21,085 --> 01:22:22,746
Is that what you reckon my price is?

886
01:22:23,954 --> 01:22:25,581
No.

887
01:22:27,625 --> 01:22:29,820
No, I reckon it's a thousand.

888
01:22:29,927 --> 01:22:32,054
$1,000.

889
01:22:32,196 --> 01:22:34,562
Now, there's 10 times that amount
in Butterfield's coach.

890
01:22:34,698 --> 01:22:35,687
Oh, yeah?

891
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,427
You want my cut, Dan?

892
01:22:37,568 --> 01:22:39,195
It's all yours.

893
01:22:39,937 --> 01:22:42,667
Isn't that kind of reckless of you, Wade?

894
01:22:42,773 --> 01:22:44,365
Seeing as, uh...

895
01:22:44,475 --> 01:22:45,942
you're so sure that, uh,

896
01:22:46,076 --> 01:22:48,237
your crew's coming to get you?

897
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,747
Oh, they're coming, Dan.

898
01:22:52,283 --> 01:22:54,911
Sure as God's vengeance,
they're coming.

899
01:22:57,788 --> 01:22:59,449
But I just like to do things easy.

900
01:23:02,126 --> 01:23:05,118
Imagine what you could do
with a thousand dollars, Dan.

901
01:23:05,262 --> 01:23:06,627
You could hire
a couple of ranch hands.

902
01:23:06,764 --> 01:23:08,732
Your boys could go to school,
grow up smart.

903
01:23:10,167 --> 01:23:12,362
What about Alice?

904
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:16,031
She would be the proud wife
of a bona fide Arizona rancher.

905
01:23:18,943 --> 01:23:21,741
All you got to do is say yes.

906
01:23:27,284 --> 01:23:28,376
Well...

907
01:23:29,587 --> 01:23:31,384
would you give me a bank note, Wade?

908
01:23:31,489 --> 01:23:35,050
Or maybe you'd be kind enough
to make a deposit for me.

909
01:23:35,159 --> 01:23:36,490
Cash.

910
01:23:41,665 --> 01:23:42,927
Well, you... you tell me, Wade.

911
01:23:43,033 --> 01:23:45,934
How would I account for...

912
01:23:46,036 --> 01:23:48,630
for that amount of money?

913
01:23:48,772 --> 01:23:51,969
And what would I tell people
when I spend it?

914
01:23:52,109 --> 01:23:53,906
That, uh...

915
01:23:54,011 --> 01:23:55,308
That you got the jump on me,

916
01:23:55,446 --> 01:23:59,348
you escaped, and somehow I got a fortune?

917
01:24:01,952 --> 01:24:04,182
No. How dumb do you think people are?

918
01:24:04,321 --> 01:24:07,290
Nobody needs to know.

919
01:24:11,128 --> 01:24:12,095
You know what?

920
01:24:12,196 --> 01:24:14,027
Would you do me a favor?

921
01:24:14,832 --> 01:24:17,096
Don't talk to me for a while.

922
01:24:17,201 --> 01:24:19,465
You mean we're still not friends?

923
01:24:19,570 --> 01:24:21,094
No.

924
01:24:23,574 --> 01:24:25,269
No, we're not.

925
01:24:25,376 --> 01:24:27,207
Come five minutes to three,

926
01:24:27,344 --> 01:24:29,869
we're gonna be a hell
of a lot closer than you think.

927
01:24:38,822 --> 01:24:41,347
They're gonna hang me

928
01:24:41,492 --> 01:24:43,392
In the mornin'

929
01:24:45,162 --> 01:24:47,062
Before the night is done

930
01:24:48,766 --> 01:24:51,530
They're gonna hang me

931
01:24:51,669 --> 01:24:53,569
In the mornin'

932
01:24:55,306 --> 01:24:57,365
I'll never see the sun

933
01:25:13,591 --> 01:25:14,580
Who is it?

934
01:25:14,725 --> 01:25:16,386
It's me, Dan.

935
01:25:16,527 --> 01:25:18,392
I brought help.

936
01:25:18,529 --> 01:25:21,760
You been gone a long time,
Mr. Butterfield.

937
01:25:21,899 --> 01:25:25,995
How do I know somebody
ain't got a gun on you out there?

938
01:25:40,451 --> 01:25:43,716
Dan, this is Marshal Will Doane.

939
01:25:43,821 --> 01:25:45,948
- Marshal.
- Mr. Evans.

940
01:25:48,926 --> 01:25:51,952
Two of my finest men:
Harvey Pell...

941
01:25:54,398 --> 01:25:56,093
Sam Fuller.

942
01:25:56,233 --> 01:25:58,098
I'm sorry about all that, Marshal.

943
01:25:58,235 --> 01:26:00,226
- I really am grateful for the help.
- Don't mention it.

944
01:26:00,337 --> 01:26:03,067
So you fellas really gonna
help put me on this train?

945
01:26:05,175 --> 01:26:08,076
It may not seem like it, Mr. Wade,

946
01:26:08,178 --> 01:26:10,544
but we got law and order in this town,
just like any other.

947
01:26:10,648 --> 01:26:13,082
Well, that's very reassuring, Marshal.

948
01:26:14,585 --> 01:26:15,950
How much is Butterfield paying you?

949
01:26:16,086 --> 01:26:18,054
That's none of your business.

950
01:26:19,256 --> 01:26:20,450
You gonna come with us?

951
01:26:20,591 --> 01:26:23,059
Oh, I'll be walking with you...

952
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,287
every step of the way.

953
01:26:26,797 --> 01:26:28,424
You have my word on that, Dan.

954
01:26:28,532 --> 01:26:31,092
So there's five of us.
Five is good.

955
01:26:33,804 --> 01:26:35,567
It ain't enough.

956
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:38,771
It ain't nearly enough.

957
01:27:02,366 --> 01:27:04,129
- Pa!
- That's my boy.

958
01:27:07,304 --> 01:27:08,271
They're coming.

959
01:27:09,873 --> 01:27:11,932
They're coming this way.
I seen 'em.

960
01:27:12,076 --> 01:27:14,670
- Where?
- About a mile out. Same way we come.

961
01:27:14,778 --> 01:27:17,338
- How many are there?
- Seven. Eight.

962
01:27:17,448 --> 01:27:19,006
Which is it, boy?
Seven or eight?

963
01:27:22,119 --> 01:27:23,086
Seven.

964
01:27:34,732 --> 01:27:36,029
Folks, sorry to bother you,

965
01:27:36,133 --> 01:27:37,964
but I'm gonna need you all
to move outside

966
01:27:38,102 --> 01:27:39,262
as quickly as possible.

967
01:27:39,403 --> 01:27:40,768
That's it, folks.

968
01:27:40,904 --> 01:27:42,371
Thank you very much.

969
01:27:42,473 --> 01:27:44,031
That's it.
Move along, folks.

970
01:27:44,141 --> 01:27:45,130
Move along.

971
01:27:47,478 --> 01:27:48,604
Come on, now!

972
01:27:48,746 --> 01:27:50,043
Hey! Get out of my way!

973
01:27:52,282 --> 01:27:53,579
Right there.

974
01:28:12,302 --> 01:28:13,894
There sure are a lot of 'em.

975
01:28:14,772 --> 01:28:17,138
I didn't figure on it
being the whole gang.

976
01:28:42,366 --> 01:28:43,333
Boss.

977
01:28:44,501 --> 01:28:45,490
Boss?

978
01:28:47,805 --> 01:28:48,999
Boss, you in there?

979
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:52,968
What do you want me to tell him?

980
01:28:53,076 --> 01:28:55,943
You tell him you'll write him
a letter every day from Yuma.

981
01:29:04,021 --> 01:29:06,285
You be careful, Wade.

982
01:29:11,495 --> 01:29:13,156
Charlie. Boys.

983
01:29:13,263 --> 01:29:15,163
- Hey, Boss.
- Yeah?

984
01:29:15,265 --> 01:29:16,664
Charlie, why don't you take the boys

985
01:29:16,767 --> 01:29:18,564
down to the saloon
and buy 'em a drink.

986
01:29:21,405 --> 01:29:22,702
You okay?

987
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:26,367
Oh, I'm fine. I'm just sittin' up here
with my four new friends.

988
01:29:26,510 --> 01:29:27,477
Hey...

989
01:29:29,012 --> 01:29:30,536
That's enough.

990
01:29:35,519 --> 01:29:37,885
Thank you, Charlie. Boys.

991
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:58,905
Listen up!

992
01:29:59,042 --> 01:30:00,703
Listen up!

993
01:30:02,746 --> 01:30:05,681
That's Ben Wade
they have up there.

994
01:30:05,782 --> 01:30:07,682
Ben... Wade!

995
01:30:13,423 --> 01:30:14,390
Now...

996
01:30:14,491 --> 01:30:17,927
the Railroad intends...

997
01:30:19,796 --> 01:30:23,596
to put him on the 3:10 to Yuma...

998
01:30:23,734 --> 01:30:25,429
and hang him.

999
01:30:25,569 --> 01:30:26,934
What's he doing?

1000
01:30:33,410 --> 01:30:38,143
We will give you 200 cash dollars

1001
01:30:38,282 --> 01:30:41,945
to any man who shoots
any one of his captors.

1002
01:30:42,085 --> 01:30:43,052
How much?

1003
01:30:44,454 --> 01:30:49,323
200 cash dollars guaranteed!

1004
01:30:53,797 --> 01:30:56,789
$200 guaranteed!

1005
01:30:59,937 --> 01:31:01,427
- Right here. You got me.
- Hand it over.

1006
01:31:01,538 --> 01:31:02,664
I'll tell you now, mister.

1007
01:31:02,806 --> 01:31:04,467
I'll take 200.
Give me the money.

1008
01:31:04,608 --> 01:31:05,905
Well, you gotta shoot 'em first.

1009
01:31:12,616 --> 01:31:15,176
There's gotta be 30, 40
more guns out there now.

1010
01:31:17,287 --> 01:31:18,948
Oh, to hell with this.

1011
01:31:20,457 --> 01:31:23,324
- Now just a minute, Marshal.
- Look, look.

1012
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:24,688
If it's a fair fight, well, sure.

1013
01:31:24,828 --> 01:31:26,591
I'd stay for that.

1014
01:31:26,697 --> 01:31:27,664
A fair fight, that...

1015
01:31:30,667 --> 01:31:32,498
That's a man's duty, but...

1016
01:31:32,636 --> 01:31:34,536
there's only five of us.

1017
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:37,632
I'm sorry, mister,

1018
01:31:37,741 --> 01:31:39,971
but I'm not gonna die here today.

1019
01:31:43,547 --> 01:31:44,673
And neither are my men.

1020
01:31:44,815 --> 01:31:45,975
Marshal...

1021
01:31:49,186 --> 01:31:50,210
forgot this.

1022
01:31:55,892 --> 01:31:57,450
Marshal...

1023
01:31:58,161 --> 01:32:00,527
Marshal!
Marshal, what's the...

1024
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:06,061
Now, you see, Dan...

1025
01:32:06,203 --> 01:32:11,038
generally, pretty much
everyone wants to live.

1026
01:32:11,174 --> 01:32:13,904
- I'll double your money.
- Let's go, boys.

1027
01:32:14,044 --> 01:32:16,979
Please. Do you wanna see us
shot down in the street?

1028
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:18,547
This thing happened in Bisbee.

1029
01:32:18,682 --> 01:32:20,411
That means Butterfield, too.

1030
01:32:20,550 --> 01:32:22,074
Why bring your troubles to Contention?

1031
01:32:22,219 --> 01:32:25,017
We've got families.
Every one of us is a family man.

1032
01:32:25,122 --> 01:32:26,680
I'm a family man, too.

1033
01:32:26,790 --> 01:32:29,588
He's gonna walk out on you.

1034
01:32:29,726 --> 01:32:33,321
Then you best get out
like the rest of us.

1035
01:32:37,601 --> 01:32:40,502
He's gonna come back up here,

1036
01:32:40,604 --> 01:32:42,538
and he's gonna walk out on you.

1037
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:45,938
Now what you gotta figure
is why you and your boy

1038
01:32:46,076 --> 01:32:48,340
are gonna die.

1039
01:32:51,314 --> 01:32:53,908
Because Butterfield's railroad
lost some money?

1040
01:33:24,081 --> 01:33:25,912
Is that all of 'em?

1041
01:33:26,016 --> 01:33:27,643
- Get inside!
- Get a doctor!

1042
01:33:30,654 --> 01:33:31,621
Almost.

1043
01:33:34,524 --> 01:33:35,650
Your move, General.

1044
01:33:40,363 --> 01:33:42,160
What do you expect him to say?

1045
01:33:42,299 --> 01:33:44,267
I expect him to say something
that makes sense.

1046
01:33:45,268 --> 01:33:47,133
Something that might
save the two of you.

1047
01:33:47,270 --> 01:33:48,396
Take a look, Dan.

1048
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:51,771
What's the matter?
You don't wanna see?

1049
01:33:51,875 --> 01:33:54,275
I'll see 'em soon enough.

1050
01:33:54,377 --> 01:33:55,810
What about you, kid?
You wanna look?

1051
01:33:55,946 --> 01:33:57,573
You stay away from
the window, William.

1052
01:33:57,681 --> 01:34:00,309
Go on, take a look.

1053
01:34:00,450 --> 01:34:02,748
Animals, all of 'em.

1054
01:34:02,853 --> 01:34:05,754
Campos, stand guard.
Jackson, back door.

1055
01:34:08,625 --> 01:34:10,115
They're gonna kill you
and your father, William.

1056
01:34:13,463 --> 01:34:16,125
They're gonna laugh while they do it.

1057
01:34:16,233 --> 01:34:17,427
I think you know that.

1058
01:34:17,534 --> 01:34:19,331
Call 'em off.

1059
01:34:21,304 --> 01:34:22,828
Why should I?

1060
01:34:22,973 --> 01:34:24,770
Because you're not all bad.

1061
01:34:29,546 --> 01:34:31,173
Yes, I am.

1062
01:34:31,314 --> 01:34:32,611
You saved us from those Indians.

1063
01:34:32,716 --> 01:34:34,343
I saved myself.

1064
01:34:34,484 --> 01:34:35,508
You got us through the tunnels.

1065
01:34:35,652 --> 01:34:37,119
You helped us get away.

1066
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:40,155
If I'd had a gun in them tunnels,

1067
01:34:40,257 --> 01:34:42,191
I would have used it on you.

1068
01:34:46,163 --> 01:34:47,323
I don't believe you.

1069
01:34:47,430 --> 01:34:51,196
Kid, I wouldn't last five minutes
leading an outfit like that

1070
01:34:51,334 --> 01:34:52,858
if I wasn't as rotten as hell.

1071
01:35:13,557 --> 01:35:14,888
Dan?

1072
01:35:23,767 --> 01:35:25,735
I can't do it, Dan.

1073
01:35:25,869 --> 01:35:28,531
And if I can't do it,
you shouldn't do it, either.

1074
01:35:29,973 --> 01:35:32,771
They say discretion
is the better part of valor.

1075
01:35:32,909 --> 01:35:34,672
If you think you have
an obligation to me

1076
01:35:34,778 --> 01:35:36,370
or to the Railroad,

1077
01:35:36,479 --> 01:35:39,573
I assure you, you do not.
I'm releasing you.

1078
01:35:39,716 --> 01:35:41,684
It's just you left, Dan.

1079
01:35:41,785 --> 01:35:43,582
Just you and your boy.

1080
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:46,553
Maybe he's right, Pa.
Maybe we should go home.

1081
01:35:55,065 --> 01:35:58,557
Well, what did Doc Potter
give his life for, William?

1082
01:35:58,668 --> 01:35:59,965
And McElroy?

1083
01:36:00,103 --> 01:36:02,071
Little red ants on a hill.

1084
01:36:02,172 --> 01:36:04,640
I'll pay you the 200, Dan, right now,

1085
01:36:04,774 --> 01:36:05,866
and you can walk away.

1086
01:36:11,281 --> 01:36:13,715
You know, this whole ride,

1087
01:36:13,817 --> 01:36:15,580
that's been nagging on me.

1088
01:36:18,021 --> 01:36:20,285
That's what the government
gave me for my leg.

1089
01:36:21,925 --> 01:36:23,825
$198.36.

1090
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:26,428
And the funny thing is that...

1091
01:36:26,529 --> 01:36:29,930
when you think about it,
which I have been lately,

1092
01:36:30,033 --> 01:36:33,127
was they weren't paying me
to walk away.

1093
01:36:34,271 --> 01:36:36,967
They were paying me
so they could walk away.

1094
01:36:39,009 --> 01:36:41,136
Don't muddy the past
and the present, Dan.

1095
01:36:41,278 --> 01:36:42,336
No, no, no, Wade.

1096
01:36:42,479 --> 01:36:45,312
I'm seeing the world the way it is.

1097
01:36:45,448 --> 01:36:48,349
If you take him to the train, Pa,
I'm going with you.

1098
01:36:48,485 --> 01:36:51,921
No, Mr. Butterfield's
gonna take you home.

1099
01:36:52,022 --> 01:36:53,990
- No, I'm not going anywhere with him.
- Yes, you are.

1100
01:36:54,124 --> 01:36:55,989
I'm staying here with you.

1101
01:36:56,126 --> 01:36:58,617
You're gonna hold up
in a room across the hall.

1102
01:36:58,728 --> 01:37:00,355
You're gonna wait until we leave.

1103
01:37:00,497 --> 01:37:02,761
I'll get him to Bisbee, Dan.
I promise you.

1104
01:37:02,866 --> 01:37:05,596
Oh, you're gonna promise me
a lot more than that, Butterfield.

1105
01:37:05,702 --> 01:37:09,138
I want guarantees that Hollander

1106
01:37:09,239 --> 01:37:10,866
and his boys

1107
01:37:11,007 --> 01:37:14,135
will never set foot
on my land again,

1108
01:37:14,244 --> 01:37:15,609
and that my water's gonna flow.

1109
01:37:15,712 --> 01:37:20,274
And I expect you to hand my wife
1,000 cash dollars when you see her.

1110
01:37:20,383 --> 01:37:21,975
You got money to spare.

1111
01:37:22,085 --> 01:37:24,315
I can deliver that.

1112
01:37:24,421 --> 01:37:25,888
Just get him on the train.

1113
01:37:28,091 --> 01:37:29,058
You heard him?

1114
01:37:29,192 --> 01:37:31,183
I heard him.

1115
01:37:33,229 --> 01:37:37,529
William, I want you
to give this back to your mother.

1116
01:37:39,569 --> 01:37:44,871
I want you to tell her that it helped me
find what was right.

1117
01:37:48,578 --> 01:37:49,738
Pa...

1118
01:37:51,514 --> 01:37:53,505
I can't.

1119
01:37:53,616 --> 01:37:54,981
I can't just leave you.

1120
01:37:55,085 --> 01:37:57,747
I'm gonna be a day
behind you, William.

1121
01:37:58,888 --> 01:38:00,515
Unless something happens,
and if it does,

1122
01:38:00,623 --> 01:38:03,558
I need a man at the ranch
to run things,

1123
01:38:03,693 --> 01:38:05,718
protect our family, and I know
that you can do that

1124
01:38:05,862 --> 01:38:08,558
because you've become
a fine man, William.

1125
01:38:08,698 --> 01:38:11,098
You've become a fine man.
You got all the best parts of me.

1126
01:38:12,535 --> 01:38:13,695
What few there are.

1127
01:38:18,875 --> 01:38:22,538
And you just remember
that your old man

1128
01:38:22,645 --> 01:38:24,374
walked Ben Wade to that station

1129
01:38:24,481 --> 01:38:26,847
when nobody else would.

1130
01:39:22,505 --> 01:39:25,633
You know, squeezing that watch
won't stop time.

1131
01:39:32,816 --> 01:39:35,808
Don't get so scared.
You might back a bad move.

1132
01:39:44,194 --> 01:39:45,525
You ever read the Bible, Dan?

1133
01:39:48,398 --> 01:39:50,263
I read it one time.

1134
01:39:50,366 --> 01:39:51,958
I was eight years old.

1135
01:39:53,336 --> 01:39:55,770
My daddy just got hisself
killed over a shot of whiskey,

1136
01:39:55,872 --> 01:39:58,306
and my mama said,
"We're going back East to start over."

1137
01:40:00,243 --> 01:40:02,768
So she gave me a Bible,

1138
01:40:02,879 --> 01:40:05,040
sat me down in the train station,
told me to read it.

1139
01:40:08,418 --> 01:40:10,545
She was gonna get our tickets.

1140
01:40:12,222 --> 01:40:15,783
Well, I did what she said.

1141
01:40:15,892 --> 01:40:18,122
I read that Bible
from cover to cover.

1142
01:40:18,228 --> 01:40:19,820
It took me three days.

1143
01:40:22,999 --> 01:40:24,364
She never came back.

1144
01:40:51,027 --> 01:40:52,358
It's time.

1145
01:41:09,312 --> 01:41:11,940
It's a half mile
to the station from here, Dan.

1146
01:41:15,618 --> 01:41:16,915
I guess we're walking.

1147
01:41:38,508 --> 01:41:39,702
There he is!

1148
01:41:45,648 --> 01:41:47,707
Go and flush him out!

1149
01:41:50,753 --> 01:41:52,550
Let's get to it.

1150
01:41:55,525 --> 01:41:56,719
Lucky.

1151
01:42:00,330 --> 01:42:01,319
Dan.

1152
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:05,767
Thanks.

1153
01:42:05,868 --> 01:42:06,926
Move.

1154
01:42:31,361 --> 01:42:32,760
Come on!

1155
01:42:34,998 --> 01:42:37,262
Might not get a chance
to use those Scofields, Charlie.

1156
01:42:39,302 --> 01:42:42,328
Perhaps you can explain to me
the next portion of your plan, Dan.

1157
01:43:00,390 --> 01:43:01,789
I think I got him!

1158
01:43:07,030 --> 01:43:09,294
Hey. Hey!

1159
01:43:09,399 --> 01:43:11,230
Not the black hat!

1160
01:43:11,367 --> 01:43:12,800
The rancher,
you dumb-shits!

1161
01:43:12,902 --> 01:43:15,632
The rancher!
The ranch...

1162
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:28,512
Charlie!

1163
01:43:31,387 --> 01:43:33,582
Get back! Get back!

1164
01:43:39,929 --> 01:43:41,226
Boss.

1165
01:43:41,964 --> 01:43:42,988
Boss!

1166
01:43:45,635 --> 01:43:47,159
Let's go.

1167
01:43:47,270 --> 01:43:48,669
The white door.
Move it!

1168
01:44:09,892 --> 01:44:11,018
All right.

1169
01:44:12,628 --> 01:44:13,959
I ain't doing this
no more, Dan.

1170
01:44:18,835 --> 01:44:20,359
I'm getting you
on that train, Wade.

1171
01:44:20,470 --> 01:44:22,563
Your son went back!

1172
01:44:22,672 --> 01:44:24,139
The boy's gone, hero.

1173
01:44:24,273 --> 01:44:26,639
Ain't nobody watching no more.

1174
01:44:26,776 --> 01:44:27,936
You still got that one good leg.

1175
01:44:28,077 --> 01:44:30,545
Why don't you use it
to get on home?

1176
01:44:30,646 --> 01:44:32,944
Charlie!

1177
01:44:33,082 --> 01:44:34,777
Charlie Prince!

1178
01:44:34,917 --> 01:44:35,884
Yeah, Boss!

1179
01:44:35,985 --> 01:44:37,384
Hold your fire.

1180
01:44:37,487 --> 01:44:39,648
- I'm walking out.
- Hold your fire!

1181
01:45:04,547 --> 01:45:07,311
I ain't never been no hero, Wade.

1182
01:45:09,519 --> 01:45:13,182
The only battle I seen,
we was in retreat.

1183
01:45:13,322 --> 01:45:15,756
My foot got shot off
by one of my own men.

1184
01:45:17,794 --> 01:45:21,286
You try telling that story to your boy.

1185
01:45:21,397 --> 01:45:23,592
See how he looks at you then.

1186
01:45:37,647 --> 01:45:40,673
Boss! Boss!

1187
01:45:44,420 --> 01:45:45,546
Okay, Dan.

1188
01:45:56,499 --> 01:45:57,625
Son.

1189
01:46:00,369 --> 01:46:01,700
They're on the roofs!

1190
01:46:02,672 --> 01:46:03,832
They're on the roofs!

1191
01:46:04,907 --> 01:46:06,033
Boss!

1192
01:46:35,071 --> 01:46:37,005
Boss! Drop!

1193
01:46:42,044 --> 01:46:43,375
- Can you make this?
- Yeah.

1194
01:46:55,825 --> 01:46:56,917
Come on.

1195
01:46:57,059 --> 01:46:58,924
Come on!

1196
01:47:17,914 --> 01:47:20,041
Go! Run!

1197
01:47:48,644 --> 01:47:49,736
Spread out!

1198
01:48:02,525 --> 01:48:03,753
What time is it?

1199
01:48:05,227 --> 01:48:06,785
About 10 past 3.

1200
01:48:06,896 --> 01:48:08,830
Where's the 3:10 to Yuma?

1201
01:48:08,965 --> 01:48:10,193
Running late, I suppose.

1202
01:48:10,333 --> 01:48:11,300
How late?

1203
01:48:12,335 --> 01:48:13,666
Beats me.

1204
01:48:13,803 --> 01:48:15,134
Gets here when it gets here.

1205
01:48:15,237 --> 01:48:17,967
Goddamn trains.
Never can rely on 'em, huh?

1206
01:48:26,716 --> 01:48:27,876
By the window!

1207
01:48:57,246 --> 01:48:58,406
You know...

1208
01:49:00,716 --> 01:49:02,547
I ain't stubborn.

1209
01:49:04,086 --> 01:49:05,519
Excuse me?

1210
01:49:06,789 --> 01:49:08,757
You said I was stubborn

1211
01:49:08,891 --> 01:49:11,018
for keeping my family
on a dying ranch.

1212
01:49:13,195 --> 01:49:15,220
It's my son Mark.

1213
01:49:15,364 --> 01:49:17,332
The young one?

1214
01:49:17,433 --> 01:49:21,233
He got tuberculosis when he was 2.

1215
01:49:21,370 --> 01:49:23,361
The doctor said he'd die

1216
01:49:23,472 --> 01:49:25,531
if he didn't have a dry climate, so...

1217
01:49:25,641 --> 01:49:27,165
Why are you telling me this?

1218
01:49:29,245 --> 01:49:31,179
I don't know.

1219
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:33,407
I guess I just...

1220
01:49:33,549 --> 01:49:38,543
wanted you to know
that I ain't stubborn is all.

1221
01:50:13,823 --> 01:50:16,621
Well, as long as we're
making confessions...

1222
01:50:16,759 --> 01:50:18,249
Yeah?

1223
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:20,294
I've been to Yuma Prison before.

1224
01:50:22,832 --> 01:50:23,992
Twice.

1225
01:50:24,133 --> 01:50:25,794
Escaped twice, too.

1226
01:51:31,767 --> 01:51:34,133
First car, sliding door.

1227
01:51:46,615 --> 01:51:47,877
They'll be coming!

1228
01:52:10,773 --> 01:52:11,740
Yeah!

1229
01:52:27,556 --> 01:52:29,421
I got a prisoner to go to Yuma!

1230
01:52:36,065 --> 01:52:37,930
Well, you did it, Dan.

1231
01:52:39,235 --> 01:52:40,395
No!

1232
01:52:51,647 --> 01:52:53,547
Pa.

1233
01:53:20,809 --> 01:53:23,903
For a one-leg rancher...

1234
01:53:26,649 --> 01:53:30,141
he's one tough son of a bitch.

1235
01:53:31,387 --> 01:53:32,684
Yeah.

1236
01:54:36,352 --> 01:54:37,842
You done it, Pa.

1237
01:54:40,689 --> 01:54:42,156
You done it.

1238
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:46,655
You got him on the train.

1239
01:55:43,018 --> 01:55:44,610
Pa.
