1
00:01:11,596 --> 00:01:13,962
Another village destroyed.

2
00:01:21,906 --> 00:01:25,273
Let's go, soon, this will also
be consumed in the Sea of Decay.

3
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,746
1,000 years after the collapse
of industrial civilization,

4
00:01:38,823 --> 00:01:41,155
the Sea of Decay, a swamp
exuding toxic vapors,

5
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,456
covered an earth strewn
with rusting ruins,

6
00:01:43,528 --> 00:01:44,995
threatening human survival.

7
00:01:47,765 --> 00:01:54,170

15
00:04:42,706 --> 00:04:44,537
An ohmu's tracks.

16
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:54,039
They're still fresh.

17
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:12,894
An ohmu's shell.

18
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:26,142
Amazing.

19
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:29,515
I've never seen a perfect shell.

20
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:40,286
Lovely sound.

21
00:05:47,204 --> 00:05:49,172
It chipped my ceramic sword.

22
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:51,605
The villagers will be pleased.

23
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:55,907
They'll have plenty
to make into tools now.

24
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,480
What an eye.

25
00:06:02,552 --> 00:06:05,214
I wonder if I can carry it?

26
00:06:34,618 --> 00:06:36,142
It came free.

27
00:06:37,554 --> 00:06:39,385
It's incredibly light.

28
00:06:52,335 --> 00:06:55,702
Mushigo Palm spores.

29
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,458
So beautiful...

30
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:18,016
Though in this forest of death,
your lungs would rot

31
00:07:18,094 --> 00:07:20,085
in five minutes without a mask.

32
00:07:41,651 --> 00:07:43,312
Who is that?

33
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:53,023
What can it be?

34
00:07:54,998 --> 00:07:56,829
My heart's pounding.

35
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:01,259
Those are gunshots.

36
00:08:01,338 --> 00:08:03,670
An insect
is attacking someone.

37
00:08:09,512 --> 00:08:11,275
Oh, I'm sorry!

38
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:28,628
Over there!

39
00:08:28,698 --> 00:08:31,599
What a thick spore cloud.

40
00:08:33,236 --> 00:08:35,727
An ohmu!
That must have been its shell.

41
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:41,677
Don't run that way!

42
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,750
Look this way!

43
00:08:53,623 --> 00:08:55,352
They answered!
They're coming.

44
00:09:28,992 --> 00:09:30,425
Who's that?

45
00:09:48,478 --> 00:09:50,639
What a magnificent ohmu.

46
00:09:56,353 --> 00:09:59,015
- Go upwind!
- Thank you!

47
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:03,492
Return to the forest, ohmu.

48
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,256
This is not your world.

49
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:08,229
Be a good boy.

50
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:12,057
It's blinded by rage.

51
00:10:12,135 --> 00:10:13,568
I've got to calm him.

52
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:46,529
The flares stunned it.

53
00:10:47,737 --> 00:10:49,671
An insect charm.

54
00:10:57,447 --> 00:10:59,472
Awaken, ohmu.

55
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:01,380
Return to the forest.

56
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:13,093
It's awake.

57
00:11:31,548 --> 00:11:34,711
The ohmu's returning to the forest.

58
00:11:34,784 --> 00:11:38,686
She tamed that ohmu
with flares and an insect charm.

59
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:21,959
Lord Yupa!

60
00:12:25,235 --> 00:12:27,226
Nausicaa,
I hardly recognized you.

61
00:12:27,337 --> 00:12:29,931
It's been a year and half.
Father will be glad.

62
00:12:30,006 --> 00:12:31,997
I must thank you.

63
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:33,975
You've become a great wind-rider.

64
00:12:34,043 --> 00:12:37,979
Oh, no, not according to father.

65
00:12:38,915 --> 00:12:42,476
Oh, of course
I'd completely forgotten about him.

66
00:12:45,788 --> 00:12:48,723
A fox-squirrel.
I've never seen one.

67
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:52,318
When a winged insect snatched him,
I took him for a human child.

68
00:12:52,395 --> 00:12:54,522
I had to fire my gun.

69
00:12:54,597 --> 00:12:56,531
That's what enraged the ohmu.

70
00:12:57,534 --> 00:13:00,264
He'd fainted
so was spared the poison.

71
00:13:00,336 --> 00:13:01,860
Better not touch him.

72
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:04,065
Even young, they're savage.

73
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,129
Come.

74
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,005
Here.

75
00:13:07,076 --> 00:13:08,839
Hey...

76
00:13:10,647 --> 00:13:12,080
You're not scared.

77
00:13:13,516 --> 00:13:15,040
You're not scared.

78
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:20,082
See... you're not scared.

79
00:13:22,825 --> 00:13:24,019
See...

80
00:13:32,035 --> 00:13:34,833
You were just frightened.

81
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:42,267
Lord Yupa, may I have him?

82
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:44,313
Why certainly...

83
00:13:45,315 --> 00:13:46,714
Thank you.

84
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:49,183
Kai and Kui.
Remember me?

85
00:13:50,587 --> 00:13:52,521
A mysterious power.

86
00:13:53,556 --> 00:13:56,855
You must be tired.
You ran so far.

87
00:13:59,862 --> 00:14:02,422
Is everyone well?

88
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:06,228
What's wrong?

89
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,000
My father...

90
00:14:10,073 --> 00:14:12,200
He can no longer fly.

91
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:14,368
Jihl...

92
00:14:14,444 --> 00:14:17,208
The forest poisons?

93
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,650
Yes. He says it's fate
for those living by the Sea of Decay.

94
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:26,246
I should have come sooner.

95
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:28,222
Oh, no.

96
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:31,489
Thank you for coming.

97
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:35,657
Lord Yupa, there's something
I want to show you.

98
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:37,893
My secret room.

99
00:14:38,401 --> 00:14:40,733
It's a secret.
I don't want to scare them.

100
00:14:40,803 --> 00:14:43,101
I'll tell them you're coming.

101
00:14:43,172 --> 00:14:45,436
Come soon!

102
00:14:46,376 --> 00:14:47,866
Lord Yupa.

103
00:14:48,945 --> 00:14:51,436
Would you carry this?

104
00:14:51,514 --> 00:14:53,914
It's hard to fly with.

105
00:15:04,494 --> 00:15:07,224
She certainly reads the wind well.

106
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:08,889
Not far now.

107
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:46,459
Oh...
Lord Yupa.

108
00:15:46,536 --> 00:15:48,834
- Welcome.
- Are you in good health?

109
00:15:50,373 --> 00:15:53,831
The waters and winds
are clear and calm.

110
00:15:54,444 --> 00:15:57,845
- Lord Yupa.
- Hello all, you're well.

111
00:16:13,162 --> 00:16:14,823
Lord Yupa.

112
00:16:16,132 --> 00:16:18,862
We've missed you.

113
00:16:21,671 --> 00:16:23,662
Princess, he has come.

114
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,765
Wait.

115
00:16:25,842 --> 00:16:27,867
Lord Yupa.

116
00:16:27,944 --> 00:16:29,969
Old Mito, you're hard at work.

117
00:16:30,346 --> 00:16:35,079
Tonight I'll hear
tales of your travels.

118
00:16:35,585 --> 00:16:40,989
OK, start it.

119
00:16:48,197 --> 00:16:50,722
- Seems to work.
- Yes.

120
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,063
This is excellent.

121
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:59,597
Tomorrow, we'll send
people to get the rest.

122
00:16:59,976 --> 00:17:02,103
Come, Toeto.

123
00:17:02,745 --> 00:17:05,714
Lord Yupa.
This is Toeto's baby, born this year.

124
00:17:05,782 --> 00:17:07,807
Oh, let's have a look.

125
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:10,547
A fine baby.

126
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,350
Reminds me of Nausicaa
as a baby.

127
00:17:13,423 --> 00:17:16,517
Please be her godfather.

128
00:17:16,592 --> 00:17:19,425
Name her that a fair wind
may favor her.

129
00:17:20,496 --> 00:17:23,693
I will indeed.
I'll find her a fine name.

130
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:25,564
Thank you.

131
00:17:25,635 --> 00:17:28,934
May she grow up
as strong as our Princess.

132
00:17:30,206 --> 00:17:33,107
She's as strong as they come.

133
00:17:33,176 --> 00:17:35,804
But we won't want her
playing in the Sea of Decay.

134
00:17:36,112 --> 00:17:38,672
But that's where
I found the ohmu shell.

135
00:17:38,748 --> 00:17:42,149
Put yourself in my shoes.
I'm responsible for this castle.

136
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:44,948
She's made me sick with worry.

137
00:17:45,988 --> 00:17:50,391
Let her play in the Sea of Decay
if she finds us ohmu shells.

138
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,896
Indeed, her presence
there saved me.

139
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:30,261
Saved by the girl?

140
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,736
This is a fine valley.
Being here calms my spirits.

141
00:18:34,804 --> 00:18:37,739
How was your journey?

142
00:18:38,674 --> 00:18:40,039
It was terrible.

143
00:18:40,142 --> 00:18:43,771
The Sea of Decay consumed
two more countries to the south.

144
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:46,982
It's spreading all the time.

145
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:50,450
And yet war and hunger
are everywhere.

146
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,750
Nothing but bad omens.

147
00:18:52,822 --> 00:18:56,258
Why can't they live
as you do in this valley?

148
00:18:56,325 --> 00:19:01,490
The ocean winds protect our valley.

149
00:19:01,564 --> 00:19:05,022
The Sea of Decay
can't reach us here.

150
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:06,432
What do you say, Yupa?

151
00:19:06,502 --> 00:19:10,302
Isn't it time you
settled in this valley?

152
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,474
Look at my condition.
It would please everyone.

153
00:19:15,344 --> 00:19:17,175
Don't bother.

154
00:19:17,246 --> 00:19:23,515
Yupa's a man who is fated
to search forever.

155
00:19:23,586 --> 00:19:25,520
Fate, huh...

156
00:19:25,588 --> 00:19:28,716
Obaba, what's he searching for?

157
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:32,227
Oh, my,
don't you know, Nausicaa?

158
00:19:32,295 --> 00:19:36,629
Look, see the tapestry on the wall...

159
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:38,462
I no longer see it.

160
00:19:38,534 --> 00:19:43,301
The figure in the left corner:

161
00:19:43,372 --> 00:19:47,172
"...clothed in blue robes,

162
00:19:47,243 --> 00:19:51,111
"descending onto a golden field,

163
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:55,913
"to join bonds
with the great earth

164
00:19:55,985 --> 00:20:00,922
"and guide the people
to the pure land, at last."

165
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:05,427
Lord Yupa, I always thought
that was only a legend.

166
00:20:05,494 --> 00:20:07,894
You mustn't tease me, Obaba.

167
00:20:07,964 --> 00:20:10,933
It's the same thing.

168
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,937
I only wish to solve
the Sea of Decay's mysteries.

169
00:20:16,005 --> 00:20:20,999
Are we humans but a tribe
destined to be swallowed and ruined

170
00:20:21,077 --> 00:20:22,601
by the Sea of Decay?

171
00:20:22,678 --> 00:20:24,908
That is what I wish to know.

172
00:20:38,494 --> 00:20:42,624
If only I could help Lord Yupa...

173
00:21:00,182 --> 00:21:02,650
Princess, Princess.

174
00:21:02,718 --> 00:21:04,652
What is it, Mito?

175
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,154
A strange scent on the wind.

176
00:21:07,223 --> 00:21:10,192
It's nearly dawn.
I'll be right there.

177
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:19,167
How is it?

178
00:21:19,235 --> 00:21:22,466
It's one fine storm,
but something's amiss.

179
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,153
Over there! Look!

180
00:21:49,231 --> 00:21:50,664
It's a ship.

181
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:53,201
Why would a ship be here?

182
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,035
What is it?

183
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:57,663
Lord Yupa. It's a ship.

184
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,731
- A ship!
- It's coming closer.

185
00:22:05,748 --> 00:22:06,908
It's huge!

186
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:18,393
It's a Tolmekian ship.

187
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:20,053
It's not flying right.

188
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:23,394
It's an emergency landing.
Help me up, Gol.

189
00:22:23,466 --> 00:22:25,696
Princess, you mustn't!

190
00:22:25,768 --> 00:22:28,464
I'll guide them to the shore.

191
00:22:30,773 --> 00:22:32,206
It's coming about.

192
00:22:32,274 --> 00:22:34,037
Off you go!

193
00:22:35,211 --> 00:22:36,769
Teto!

194
00:23:04,507 --> 00:23:05,701
How dare they!

195
00:23:05,775 --> 00:23:08,403
They must have landed before
and killed some insects.

196
00:23:10,146 --> 00:23:13,809
Turn away!
You'll crash!

197
00:23:13,883 --> 00:23:15,646
Turn away!

198
00:23:18,687 --> 00:23:20,917
Turn!

199
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,804
- It crashed.
- The Princess.

200
00:23:36,872 --> 00:23:39,864
- The cliffs.
- Let's go!

201
00:23:39,942 --> 00:23:41,569
Everyone to the rescue.

202
00:23:41,644 --> 00:23:43,475
Even the boys!

203
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:10,971
It's that girl, she's alive.

204
00:24:30,626 --> 00:24:31,752
Where am I...

205
00:24:31,827 --> 00:24:34,295
The Valley of the Wind.
Save your strength.

206
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:51,411
My name is...

207
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,074
Lastel of Pejite.

208
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:56,413
My cargo...
Burn the cargo...

209
00:24:56,485 --> 00:24:59,943
- The cargo...
- Please, burn it.

210
00:25:00,022 --> 00:25:01,990
Your cargo, I understand.

211
00:25:02,057 --> 00:25:03,991
Don't worry.
It's all in flames.

212
00:25:06,028 --> 00:25:07,928
Thank goodness.

213
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,691
Princess!

214
00:25:19,408 --> 00:25:22,673
That's...
The Princess of Pejite.

215
00:25:33,422 --> 00:25:36,823
An insect!
An Ushiabu's alive.

216
00:25:39,795 --> 00:25:41,990
Oh, no, it's calling its friends.

217
00:25:42,064 --> 00:25:44,692
- It can't fly.
- Bring guns!

218
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:47,235
No, if you shoot it,
it'll call others.

219
00:25:47,303 --> 00:25:48,565
I'll kill it now.

220
00:25:48,637 --> 00:25:50,366
Guns won't kill an Ushiabu.

221
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:52,134
Then what!

222
00:25:52,207 --> 00:25:55,267
Wait! Mito! Bring my glider.

223
00:25:57,313 --> 00:25:58,507
Princess!

224
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,431
Return to the forest.
You're strong, you can fly.

225
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:27,943
That's a good boy.

226
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:32,445
- Princess.
- Thanks.

227
00:26:54,603 --> 00:26:57,800
Thank God.
No telling how we'd suffer

228
00:26:57,873 --> 00:27:00,603
for even a single insect's death.

229
00:27:57,933 --> 00:27:59,594
An ohmu...

230
00:28:57,993 --> 00:28:59,927
Found one!
Come!

231
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:02,863
Here!

232
00:29:02,931 --> 00:29:05,866
So those were spores
stuck to that ship.

233
00:29:05,934 --> 00:29:07,902
They haven't released
any toxins yet.

234
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:14,008
We're almost done.

235
00:29:14,076 --> 00:29:16,374
I know.
We can't miss a single one.

236
00:29:23,952 --> 00:29:26,045
What on earth is this?

237
00:29:26,121 --> 00:29:28,885
The fire didn't destroy it...

238
00:29:28,957 --> 00:29:32,085
Leave this mystery
for later, folks.

239
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:35,153
Go and help burn the spores.

240
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,199
Be careful, now.

241
00:29:39,334 --> 00:29:41,495
Why'd she bring
this bundle of trouble here.

242
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,800
Mito, look here.

243
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:52,944
It's pulsing.
Almost like it's alive.

244
00:29:54,383 --> 00:29:56,146
Lord Yupa, what is this...

245
00:29:56,218 --> 00:29:59,813
On my journey
I heard ominous rumors...

246
00:29:59,888 --> 00:30:03,483
That a monster from the old world
that had slept beneath Pejite

247
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:04,924
had been unearthed.

248
00:30:04,993 --> 00:30:07,427
A monster from the old world?

249
00:30:07,496 --> 00:30:09,191
Giant Warriors...

250
00:30:09,264 --> 00:30:10,458
The Giant Warriors!

251
00:30:10,532 --> 00:30:13,865
They say they were destroyed
in the Seven Days of Fire.

252
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,467
This...

253
00:30:22,511 --> 00:30:24,206
The Giant Warriors were all said

254
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:26,304
to have turned to stone.

255
00:30:29,518 --> 00:30:34,455
But a single one slept
in the earth for 1,000 years.

256
00:30:34,523 --> 00:30:39,460
In... In a way,
the thing looks almost human.

257
00:30:39,528 --> 00:30:44,158
Tolmekia's a savage military state,
far to our west.

258
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:47,498
And remember the Pejite
captive who perished...

259
00:30:51,406 --> 00:30:52,998
Keep up the good work.

260
00:31:03,652 --> 00:31:04,949
What's that?

261
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:29,136
Tolmekian ships!

262
00:31:29,211 --> 00:31:30,803
Everyone to the castle!

263
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,750
To the castle!

264
00:31:40,822 --> 00:31:43,017
Gather in the castle!

265
00:31:43,091 --> 00:31:44,615
The castle!

266
00:31:46,128 --> 00:31:47,459
Father!

267
00:31:58,206 --> 00:32:00,697
Obaba, hide yourself.

268
00:32:00,776 --> 00:32:02,676
I'll stay right where I am.

269
00:32:21,063 --> 00:32:22,553
Princess!

270
00:32:36,511 --> 00:32:37,671
How dare you!

271
00:33:01,737 --> 00:33:03,068
Nausicaa...

272
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,169
Stay where you are!

273
00:33:10,245 --> 00:33:12,679
Move and this sword,
carved of insect shell

274
00:33:12,748 --> 00:33:15,308
will pierce your ceramic armor.

275
00:33:15,384 --> 00:33:17,284
That's Yupa...

276
00:33:17,383 --> 00:33:21,012
I ask you Tolmekian warriors.

277
00:33:21,086 --> 00:33:26,285
Last night, these villagers toiled
desperately to save one of your ships.

278
00:33:26,358 --> 00:33:29,054
We have just now gently
laid one of your dead to rest.

279
00:33:29,128 --> 00:33:34,122
Is this how you Tolmekians
treat such a nation, however weak!

280
00:33:34,199 --> 00:33:37,896
If you would make war,
you must have reasons.

281
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:41,428
You should first send a messenger
to declare them.

282
00:33:44,576 --> 00:33:47,409
Nausicaa...
Be calm, Nausicaa.

283
00:33:47,479 --> 00:33:51,415
If you fight now,
they will slaughter the villagers.

284
00:33:51,483 --> 00:33:54,919
We must survive.
Wait for our chance.

285
00:33:54,987 --> 00:33:58,718
You... Little wench.

286
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:00,486
Put it down, Kurotowa.

287
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,390
But...

288
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:07,988
Look at this mess.
Killed them all.

289
00:34:08,967 --> 00:34:10,958
Your rebuke stings.

290
00:34:11,036 --> 00:34:14,699
Are you Yupamiralda,
the greatest swordsman of this region?

291
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:18,336
We have not come for slaughter.

292
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:20,708
We wish to talk.
Lay down your sword.

293
00:35:00,686 --> 00:35:02,210
The Princess!

294
00:35:02,287 --> 00:35:04,152
Princess!

295
00:35:07,526 --> 00:35:08,891
Listen well!

296
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:11,725
Her Highness Kushana,
Division Commander

297
00:35:11,797 --> 00:35:14,288
of the Tolmekian
Frontier Forces will speak.

298
00:35:14,366 --> 00:35:18,826
We have come to unify
the frontier nations

299
00:35:18,904 --> 00:35:22,305
and build peace in this region.

300
00:35:22,374 --> 00:35:26,538
You live on the brink of extinction
beside the Sea of Decay.

301
00:35:26,612 --> 00:35:31,140
Accept our rule
and join our enterprise.

302
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:35,050
We shall burn away the Sea of Decay
and resurrect the earth!

303
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,815
Burn away the Sea of Decay?

304
00:35:36,889 --> 00:35:38,083
Is that possible?

305
00:35:38,156 --> 00:35:41,319
We have revived
the miraculous skills and power

306
00:35:41,393 --> 00:35:45,329
that once allowed humans
to rule this earth.

307
00:35:45,397 --> 00:35:47,126
For those who submit to us,

308
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:51,659
I promise a life free from fear
of the toxins and insects of that swamp.

309
00:35:55,841 --> 00:35:57,832
Wait!

310
00:36:01,346 --> 00:36:03,837
You must not harm the Sea of Decay.

311
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:05,713
What's that, you old hag?

312
00:36:05,784 --> 00:36:07,581
Take her away.

313
00:36:07,653 --> 00:36:09,348
Let her speak.

314
00:36:09,421 --> 00:36:12,879
In the 1,000 years
of the Sea of Decay,

315
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:17,486
countless times have humans
sought to burn it away.

316
00:36:17,563 --> 00:36:22,193
Yet... each time herds
of ohmus, blind with rage,

317
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:27,364
have swarmed the earth,
like a tidal wave.

318
00:36:35,414 --> 00:36:39,145
Destroying nations,
swallowing cities,

319
00:36:39,217 --> 00:36:43,051
the ohmus' rage would not quiet

320
00:36:43,121 --> 00:36:46,215
until they starved to death.

321
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:53,356
In time, the spores
took root in the ohmus' rotting flesh,

322
00:36:53,432 --> 00:36:57,630
and engulfed our vast earth
in this Sea of Decay.

323
00:36:57,703 --> 00:37:00,604
You must not touch
the Sea of Decay.

324
00:37:00,672 --> 00:37:03,505
Enough!
No more of your ravings.

325
00:37:03,575 --> 00:37:07,602
Ah! What will you do?
Kill me, too?

326
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:09,112
You!

327
00:37:09,181 --> 00:37:12,708
Kill me if you will!

328
00:37:12,784 --> 00:37:14,843
Easy work to murder
an old blind woman.

329
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,854
Just as you murdered Jihl.

330
00:37:16,922 --> 00:37:18,355
Not Jihl!

331
00:37:18,423 --> 00:37:24,851
- How cruel!
- He was helpless!

332
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:27,865
Shut them up!
Show no mercy to impudence!

333
00:37:27,933 --> 00:37:29,423
Wait, everyone!

334
00:37:29,501 --> 00:37:31,628
Please listen to me.

335
00:37:35,774 --> 00:37:38,868
I don't want anymore sacrifices.

336
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,536
Please.

337
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,074
Princess...

338
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:46,850
You, too, Obaba.

339
00:37:46,918 --> 00:37:50,410
We must submit to these people.

340
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:06,631
Step on it.

341
00:38:16,948 --> 00:38:18,882
Hurry up!

342
00:38:24,489 --> 00:38:27,151
It really is a lovely valley.

343
00:38:27,225 --> 00:38:29,159
I'm against it.

344
00:38:29,227 --> 00:38:32,663
We have orders to send
the Giant Warrior back at once.

345
00:38:32,731 --> 00:38:35,199
An order we can't possibly fulfill.

346
00:38:35,267 --> 00:38:39,169
Even our biggest ship
collapsed from its weight.

347
00:38:39,237 --> 00:38:42,673
But you can't be serious
about building a nation here...

348
00:38:42,741 --> 00:38:44,834
And what if I am?

349
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:49,108
You expect me to hand over
that monster as a toy for those fools?

350
00:38:49,181 --> 00:38:51,615
You have a point...

351
00:38:51,683 --> 00:38:54,015
I am but a simple soldier.

352
00:38:54,086 --> 00:38:56,350
Such a decision is beyond my position.

353
00:38:56,421 --> 00:38:58,514
You're a sly fox.

354
00:39:02,794 --> 00:39:06,628
While I'm in Pejite, your priority
is to revive that Giant Warrior.

355
00:39:06,698 --> 00:39:08,188
Yes.

356
00:39:08,266 --> 00:39:09,563
Can this gun ship fly?

357
00:39:09,634 --> 00:39:12,364
Yes, we found it here.

358
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:17,374
Get this straight.
I'm not asking you.

359
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:20,605
But take the Princess to Pejite...

360
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:23,011
Five hostages, the gun ship and food...

361
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:25,140
You pick the hostages.

362
00:39:25,217 --> 00:39:27,549
Prepare everything
for the morning.

363
00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:41,555
Thanks for going as a hostage.

364
00:39:41,633 --> 00:39:43,294
We're fine, but look.

365
00:39:43,368 --> 00:39:45,893
They're taking everything in sight.

366
00:39:45,971 --> 00:39:50,738
I will slip away, return in secret
and await my chance.

367
00:39:50,809 --> 00:39:53,369
We must prevent
that monster's resurrection.

368
00:39:53,445 --> 00:39:54,434
Yes.

369
00:39:58,717 --> 00:40:00,048
Nausicaa.

370
00:40:14,299 --> 00:40:17,291
Teto, where is she?

371
00:41:12,457 --> 00:41:15,722
Nausicaa! What on earth is this?

372
00:41:15,794 --> 00:41:18,285
These plants
are from the Sea of Decay.

373
00:41:18,363 --> 00:41:21,594
I've grown them
from spores I collected.

374
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:24,294
Don't worry, they're not toxic.

375
00:41:24,369 --> 00:41:26,860
Not toxic...

376
00:41:26,938 --> 00:41:30,101
The air here is pure indeed, but...

377
00:41:31,776 --> 00:41:35,177
Why... with this deadly poisonous
plant blooming?

378
00:41:35,247 --> 00:41:41,186
The castle windmill draws water
from deep within the earth.

379
00:41:41,253 --> 00:41:44,950
The sand, too,
comes from the very bottom of the well.

380
00:41:45,023 --> 00:41:47,321
With pure water and soil,

381
00:41:47,392 --> 00:41:50,919
the plants from the Sea of Decay
are not poisonous.

382
00:41:50,996 --> 00:41:53,123
The pollution lies in the earth itself.

383
00:41:53,198 --> 00:41:55,962
Even the earth of our valley.

384
00:41:56,034 --> 00:41:57,467
Why...

385
00:41:57,535 --> 00:42:02,336
Who made such
a terrible mess of the world?

386
00:42:02,407 --> 00:42:05,001
Did you do this all yourself?

387
00:42:06,077 --> 00:42:07,135
Yes.

388
00:42:07,212 --> 00:42:09,874
To cure my father's illness
and that of others.

389
00:42:13,752 --> 00:42:16,016
But... I'm closing it down.

390
00:42:16,087 --> 00:42:20,751
I just shut off the water
and they'll soon wither and die.

391
00:42:33,939 --> 00:42:35,600
Nausicaa.

392
00:42:35,674 --> 00:42:37,972
I frighten myself.

393
00:42:40,111 --> 00:42:43,945
I don't know what my rage
will make me do.

394
00:42:44,015 --> 00:42:47,246
I don't want to kill anyone.

395
00:43:17,949 --> 00:43:20,816
Princess.

396
00:43:20,885 --> 00:43:22,876
We gathered these for you.

397
00:43:22,954 --> 00:43:25,616
- Chiko nuts.
- They're for you.

398
00:43:27,092 --> 00:43:28,855
All of you...

399
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:31,485
So many.

400
00:43:31,563 --> 00:43:33,588
You've worked so hard.

401
00:43:34,899 --> 00:43:36,924
Thank you.

402
00:43:37,002 --> 00:43:39,835
- They're very precious.
- It's not fair, Princess.

403
00:43:39,904 --> 00:43:41,838
All aboard!
We're taking off.

404
00:43:41,906 --> 00:43:44,136
There, now.

405
00:43:44,209 --> 00:43:46,336
You mustn't cry.

406
00:43:46,411 --> 00:43:49,346
Don't worry.
I'll be home in no time.

407
00:43:49,414 --> 00:43:51,348
Really?

408
00:43:51,416 --> 00:43:54,715
Why, have I ever lied to you?

409
00:43:54,786 --> 00:43:56,310
No.

410
00:43:56,388 --> 00:43:58,618
- Right?
- Yeah.

411
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:01,682
- Promise?
- Yes.

412
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,352
Go along, it's dangerous.

413
00:44:03,428 --> 00:44:04,622
OK.

414
00:44:09,601 --> 00:44:11,933
You promised!

415
00:44:21,913 --> 00:44:24,882
Take care of the Princess!

416
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,060
Aren't we in Pejite yet?

417
00:45:18,136 --> 00:45:20,434
My back is killing me.

418
00:45:20,505 --> 00:45:25,602
Boy oh boy, did the Princess
ever pick a bunch of losers.

419
00:45:27,045 --> 00:45:28,945
Hey, isn't this strange?

420
00:45:30,115 --> 00:45:32,948
Why do they fly so close together?

421
00:45:33,017 --> 00:45:35,986
Like they're afraid of an attack.

422
00:45:51,402 --> 00:45:54,030
Toxins swirl below the clouds.

423
00:46:03,948 --> 00:46:05,176
Don't move.

424
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,709
A gun ship!

425
00:46:19,297 --> 00:46:22,425
Enemy fire!
They've hit ship number two!

426
00:46:29,307 --> 00:46:31,275
I told you so.

427
00:46:31,342 --> 00:46:32,900
Wow, terrifying!

428
00:46:37,815 --> 00:46:39,009
Defense formation!

429
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:41,176
- That's a Pejite gun ship
- Pejite!

430
00:46:53,398 --> 00:46:55,992
Damn! They got number three.

431
00:46:56,067 --> 00:46:57,830
What's the Korvet doing?

432
00:46:57,902 --> 00:47:00,370
Their ships just crumble.

433
00:47:09,447 --> 00:47:11,381
Oh no, he's hit our tail.

434
00:47:16,087 --> 00:47:17,679
The Barge tether snapped.

435
00:47:23,228 --> 00:47:25,219
Hurry, Teto.

436
00:47:43,414 --> 00:47:47,111
Oh, no, we're going down.
Princess!

437
00:47:53,024 --> 00:47:56,187
Stop! No more killing!

438
00:48:05,169 --> 00:48:06,898
No more!

439
00:48:26,124 --> 00:48:27,455
Princess.

440
00:48:36,034 --> 00:48:37,160
Hurry, Mito!

441
00:48:37,235 --> 00:48:40,102
Princess, we're doomed.

442
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:48,073
- Maybe I can fly it.
- Are you crazy!

443
00:48:49,647 --> 00:48:53,242
- Hurry, Mito!
- What? Right!

444
00:48:54,252 --> 00:48:57,346
Start the engine!
Blast open the door!

445
00:49:05,496 --> 00:49:08,226
Come! Hurry!

446
00:49:10,835 --> 00:49:12,393
Get inside.
Mito, ready?

447
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:14,404
Ready or not!

448
00:49:16,474 --> 00:49:18,738
Full throttle when we take off!

449
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:21,404
- Roger!
- Ready! Go!

450
00:49:33,024 --> 00:49:34,582
Put on the toxin mask.

451
00:49:34,659 --> 00:49:37,127
Drop below the clouds
to find the Barge.

452
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:50,230
You're still warm.
Don't give up, Teto.

453
00:50:03,054 --> 00:50:05,386
What is this place!

454
00:50:05,456 --> 00:50:07,981
I've never seen
such dense toxins.

455
00:50:08,059 --> 00:50:10,687
Keep an eye on the right tail.

456
00:50:10,762 --> 00:50:14,357
It's nearby.
It's still aloft.

457
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:17,460
Hey! You're right!

458
00:50:17,535 --> 00:50:18,729
There it is!

459
00:50:32,483 --> 00:50:34,815
- It's the Princess!
- Princess!

460
00:50:34,886 --> 00:50:37,514
Don't give up, everyone.
I'll throw you a rope.

461
00:50:37,588 --> 00:50:39,886
Our hook's broken.

462
00:50:39,957 --> 00:50:42,016
You can't hook us in mid-air.

463
00:50:42,093 --> 00:50:45,494
I don't want to crash
and become insect food!

464
00:50:45,563 --> 00:50:47,531
We'll leap to our deaths!

465
00:50:47,598 --> 00:50:51,034
Don't panic!
Ditch your cargo.

466
00:50:51,102 --> 00:50:53,263
- Goodbye!
- Farewell!

467
00:50:53,337 --> 00:50:56,033
Listen to me!
Toss your cargo!

468
00:50:56,107 --> 00:50:58,769
- Kill the rear engine.
- What?

469
00:50:58,843 --> 00:51:00,572
The engine noise is too loud.
Hurry!

470
00:51:00,645 --> 00:51:01,669
Yes!

471
00:51:01,746 --> 00:51:03,714
What?

472
00:51:07,452 --> 00:51:10,421
Princess...
What are you...

473
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:14,385
Your mask, Princess!

474
00:51:14,459 --> 00:51:15,653
You'll die!

475
00:51:15,726 --> 00:51:17,159
Put your mask on!

476
00:51:17,228 --> 00:51:21,028
I promise you'll be safe.
Trust me and dump that cargo.

477
00:51:21,098 --> 00:51:22,656
We'll do whatever you say.

478
00:51:22,733 --> 00:51:25,531
Please! Put your mask back on!

479
00:51:30,741 --> 00:51:33,005
The Princess is smiling.

480
00:51:33,077 --> 00:51:34,510
We're going to be OK.

481
00:51:34,579 --> 00:51:36,376
Hurry! Lose the cargo.

482
00:51:36,447 --> 00:51:40,213
- Princess, we're in a nose-dive!
- Re-start engines!

483
00:51:40,284 --> 00:51:42,275
I inhaled.

484
00:51:45,556 --> 00:51:49,151
Hurry, hurry.

485
00:53:00,631 --> 00:53:02,599
Princess!

486
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:04,532
Everyone safe?

487
00:53:04,602 --> 00:53:05,591
Don't move!

488
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:10,373
You!

489
00:53:11,542 --> 00:53:12,839
Thanks for saving me.

490
00:53:13,578 --> 00:53:15,842
Why'd you save her, Princess?

491
00:53:15,913 --> 00:53:17,574
You're a fool.

492
00:53:17,648 --> 00:53:20,378
You thought
I'd grovel in gratitude?

493
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:23,880
You know nothing of the Sea of Decay.

494
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:28,183
It isn't like the human world.

495
00:53:28,259 --> 00:53:32,855
There's no knowing
what a single gunshot will bring.

496
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:35,956
That battle
hurled ships into this forest.

497
00:53:36,033 --> 00:53:37,432
The insects are furious.

498
00:53:37,501 --> 00:53:39,401
Look up.

499
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,805
The Yamma are sentries.

500
00:53:51,882 --> 00:53:54,373
They'll quickly bring other insects.

501
00:53:54,452 --> 00:53:57,717
We must escape now.
Throw me your extra rope.

502
00:53:57,788 --> 00:53:59,415
Mito, fix the hook.

503
00:54:01,926 --> 00:54:04,588
Don't move.
I give the orders.

504
00:54:04,662 --> 00:54:06,892
What are you so afraid of?

505
00:54:06,964 --> 00:54:08,955
You're just like
a lost fox-squirrel

506
00:54:09,033 --> 00:54:10,830
How dare you!

507
00:54:10,901 --> 00:54:13,597
Don't be afraid.

508
00:54:13,671 --> 00:54:16,105
We just want you to go back
to your own country.

509
00:54:16,173 --> 00:54:17,902
You...

510
00:54:28,552 --> 00:54:29,780
They're here!

511
00:54:43,601 --> 00:54:47,037
Quiet! Don't anger them

512
00:54:47,104 --> 00:54:49,868
This is an ohmu's nest!

513
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,805
We're surrounded.

514
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:15,555
They're examining us.

515
00:55:16,634 --> 00:55:19,125
Forgive us, ohmu,

516
00:55:19,203 --> 00:55:21,535
for disturbing your nest.

517
00:55:22,339 --> 00:55:25,570
Please understand,
we're not your enemies.

518
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:48,699
Princess!

519
00:56:57,301 --> 00:56:58,996
He's still alive.

520
00:56:59,069 --> 00:57:01,264
Wait, ohmu!

521
00:57:14,685 --> 00:57:16,482
What's happening?

522
00:57:16,554 --> 00:57:18,545
Their eyes have turned blood-red.

523
00:57:27,331 --> 00:57:30,266
What will you do with the glider?

524
00:57:30,334 --> 00:57:33,770
When the waters quiet,
take off and wait for me above.

525
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:36,773
If I'm not back in one hour,
return to the valley.

526
00:57:36,841 --> 00:57:38,399
But...

527
00:57:38,475 --> 00:57:40,500
Princess!

528
00:57:55,926 --> 00:57:58,053
She's gone.

529
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:00,829
Hand it over.

530
00:58:04,768 --> 00:58:06,395
All right, everyone.

531
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:09,633
We'll do as the Princess said.

532
00:58:12,276 --> 00:58:13,607
Princess...

533
00:58:38,202 --> 00:58:39,897
Damn!

534
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:18,039
- Who are you?
- You think only of killing.

535
00:59:18,542 --> 00:59:20,442
My flares and charms
won't help now

536
01:00:21,572 --> 01:00:23,665
It's quicksand!

537
01:00:28,846 --> 01:00:30,473
Damn!

538
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:57,503
It's been two hours already.

539
01:00:57,574 --> 01:00:59,439
More and more insects.

540
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:01,375
Princess!

541
01:01:03,013 --> 01:01:05,538
Princess!

542
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:18,656
Nausicaa.

543
01:01:18,726 --> 01:01:21,024
Nausicaa.

544
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:24,891
Come here.

545
01:01:28,135 --> 01:01:29,625
Come here.

546
01:01:31,338 --> 01:01:32,930
Father.

547
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:45,015
Mother's here, too.

548
01:01:53,594 --> 01:01:57,325
No, I don't want to go.

549
01:01:58,899 --> 01:02:01,060
Stay away!

550
01:02:03,904 --> 01:02:06,134
There's nothing here.

551
01:02:06,206 --> 01:02:08,197
I said, there's nothing!

552
01:02:12,913 --> 01:02:15,347
Stay inside.

553
01:02:15,416 --> 01:02:17,907
It's a baby ohmu.

554
01:02:17,985 --> 01:02:20,852
She's being used by the insects.

555
01:02:20,921 --> 01:02:23,856
Give it to me, Nausicaa.

556
01:02:23,924 --> 01:02:26,518
No! It's not doing anything bad.

557
01:02:26,594 --> 01:02:30,860
Insects and humans
can't live in the same world.

558
01:02:41,308 --> 01:02:44,436
Please, don't kill it!

559
01:02:46,046 --> 01:02:47,536
Please!

560
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:07,424
Teto...

561
01:04:08,195 --> 01:04:10,493
What a strange place.

562
01:04:15,102 --> 01:04:16,729
Hey!

563
01:04:16,804 --> 01:04:18,829
I finally found it.

564
01:04:18,906 --> 01:04:21,204
How are you feeling?

565
01:04:21,275 --> 01:04:23,072
Where are we?

566
01:04:23,143 --> 01:04:25,771
First, let me thank you.

567
01:04:25,846 --> 01:04:27,438
I'm Asbel of Pejite.

568
01:04:27,514 --> 01:04:29,744
Thank you for saving me.

569
01:04:30,851 --> 01:04:33,752
I'm Nausicaa
of the Valley of the Wind.

570
01:04:34,922 --> 01:04:36,253
Where are we?

571
01:04:38,192 --> 01:04:39,853
No wonder you're surprised.

572
01:04:39,927 --> 01:04:42,020
We're beneath the Sea of Decay.

573
01:04:42,096 --> 01:04:43,825
Beneath the Sea of Decay?

574
01:04:43,897 --> 01:04:46,058
Look, we fell from up there,

575
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:48,033
along with the sand.

576
01:04:50,671 --> 01:04:52,571
We're not wearing masks.

577
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:56,166
That's right.
The air here is pure.

578
01:04:56,243 --> 01:04:58,177
Couldn't believe it myself,

579
01:04:58,245 --> 01:05:01,078
finding this place
under the Sea of Decay.

580
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:09,482
What is it?

581
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,392
Nausicaa, don't wander too far.

582
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:46,826
What a wonderful tree.

583
01:06:02,309 --> 01:06:05,005
Even though it's dead,
water still flows through it.

584
01:06:39,179 --> 01:06:42,307
Just like the sand
at the bottom of our well.

585
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:53,983
Grains of petrified wood
sifting down from above.

586
01:07:12,646 --> 01:07:13,772
Nausicaa.

587
01:07:18,852 --> 01:07:20,285
Are you crying?

588
01:07:23,624 --> 01:07:25,888
Yes. I'm so happy.

589
01:07:45,145 --> 01:07:48,273
Lastel was my twin sister.

590
01:07:48,348 --> 01:07:50,782
I should have been with her.

591
01:07:50,851 --> 01:07:53,786
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

592
01:07:53,854 --> 01:07:55,549
Oh, no...

593
01:07:55,622 --> 01:07:57,351
I'm sorry.

594
01:07:57,424 --> 01:08:01,326
I nearly killed the person
who eased my sister's pain.

595
01:08:02,763 --> 01:08:06,597
I see...
So it's in the Valley of the Wind.

596
01:08:14,141 --> 01:08:16,075
This nut tastes really weird.

597
01:08:16,143 --> 01:08:19,169
It's a chiko nut.
It's really good for you.

598
01:08:31,658 --> 01:08:35,594
It doesn't taste great,
but I could eat a whole boot-full!

599
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:49,135
Why the Sea of Decay was born...

600
01:08:49,209 --> 01:08:52,007
You think the strangest thoughts.

601
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:56,277
The trees of the Sea of Decay

602
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:59,285
grew to cleanse
a world polluted by humans.

603
01:09:00,387 --> 01:09:02,685
They absorb toxins from the earth,

604
01:09:02,756 --> 01:09:06,522
generate pure crystals,
die and turn to sand.

605
01:09:07,427 --> 01:09:10,555
That's what created
these underground caverns.

606
01:09:11,832 --> 01:09:14,892
The insects protect this forest.

607
01:09:14,968 --> 01:09:18,335
In that case, we're doomed.

608
01:09:18,405 --> 01:09:20,635
We can't possibly survive,

609
01:09:20,707 --> 01:09:23,938
living in terror of toxins and insects
for thousands of years.

610
01:09:25,312 --> 01:09:29,442
At least we can find a way
to keep it from spreading.

611
01:09:30,183 --> 01:09:32,879
You sound just like Kushana.

612
01:09:32,953 --> 01:09:36,753
No! We don't plan to use
the Giant Warriors!

613
01:09:36,823 --> 01:09:39,690
You'll see when you
meet my friends tomorrow.

614
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:44,459
Let's go to sleep.
We have far to go tomorrow.

615
01:10:08,088 --> 01:10:09,749
All's well.

616
01:10:12,726 --> 01:10:14,023
On schedule?

617
01:10:14,094 --> 01:10:16,255
The torso is solidifying well.

618
01:10:40,287 --> 01:10:44,553
You're one cute monster.

619
01:10:44,624 --> 01:10:47,149
Makes a poor soldier think

620
01:10:47,227 --> 01:10:50,094
of dusting off old ambitions.

621
01:10:53,533 --> 01:10:55,831
It's grinning.

622
01:10:55,902 --> 01:10:59,963
You should've slept
beneath the earth till the end of time.

623
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,439
Counselor!

624
01:11:02,542 --> 01:11:05,340
Her Highness' planes
were attacked by Pejite survivors.

625
01:11:05,412 --> 01:11:07,403
All crashed, except the Korvet.

626
01:11:07,481 --> 01:11:09,415
What about Her Highness?

627
01:11:09,483 --> 01:11:12,418
Her ship exploded in flight.

628
01:11:14,921 --> 01:11:16,218
Counselor.

629
01:11:17,491 --> 01:11:20,858
- The villagers don't know yet?
- No.

630
01:11:20,927 --> 01:11:22,155
OK, we'll head out.

631
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:24,459
You stay here and keep working.

632
01:11:31,171 --> 01:11:36,199
Either fortune's finally smiling
on this lowly soldier...

633
01:11:36,276 --> 01:11:38,870
Or it's a trap set to destroy me...

634
01:11:47,087 --> 01:11:49,453
Mito and the others have returned,

635
01:11:49,523 --> 01:11:51,684
waiting at Acid Lake, Lord Yupa.

636
01:12:13,013 --> 01:12:15,811
In shame we return without her.

637
01:12:15,882 --> 01:12:18,112
No, no, I'm pleased you're safe.

638
01:12:22,589 --> 01:12:23,920
Releasing me?

639
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:26,982
Drown the Giant Warrior
deep in Acid Lake,

640
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:29,893
and return to your country...

641
01:12:29,963 --> 01:12:32,193
Few of your soldiers remain here.

642
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:36,531
We could easily start a fight,
but why sacrifice more people?

643
01:12:36,603 --> 01:12:38,730
Fire and water are powerless against it,

644
01:12:38,805 --> 01:12:42,138
and it's only a matter of time
before it starts to walk.

645
01:12:42,209 --> 01:12:46,009
Don't you see?
It's far too late to turn back.

646
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:49,515
My orders to invade Pejite
were motivated by fear

647
01:12:49,583 --> 01:12:52,017
that another country
had harnessed its strength.

648
01:12:52,986 --> 01:12:54,977
Once its presence here is known,

649
01:12:55,055 --> 01:12:58,456
the great powers
will send their armies.

650
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:03,029
You have but one choice left.

651
01:13:03,096 --> 01:13:07,396
Revive the Giant Warrior,
defy both great powers

652
01:13:07,467 --> 01:13:09,458
and learn to live with that thing.

653
01:13:09,536 --> 01:13:10,833
Look.

654
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:17,037
An insect did that?

655
01:13:17,777 --> 01:13:21,770
Whoever becomes my husband
will see worse than that.

656
01:13:21,848 --> 01:13:24,146
Burn the Sea of Decay,
kill the insects,

657
01:13:24,217 --> 01:13:26,811
and restore the human world.
Why do you hesitate!

658
01:13:28,121 --> 01:13:31,989
Steal it from us,
just as we stole it from Pejite.

659
01:13:35,362 --> 01:13:38,331
We shall not give
the Giant Warrior life.

660
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:41,358
Emergency!

661
01:13:41,434 --> 01:13:44,198
- What's the password?
- I'm in a hurry!

662
01:13:44,271 --> 01:13:45,932
- Wind.
- Valley!

663
01:13:46,006 --> 01:13:46,995
OK.

664
01:13:47,073 --> 01:13:48,233
Some spores survived!

665
01:13:48,308 --> 01:13:49,741
What!

666
01:13:49,809 --> 01:13:53,267
They're spreading toxins
and the valley's going crazy!

667
01:14:01,321 --> 01:14:03,516
Hand 'em over.

668
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:05,251
Hurry up!

669
01:14:05,325 --> 01:14:07,987
Hurry, or the valley's doomed.

670
01:14:08,061 --> 01:14:10,757
We need our tools back.

671
01:14:10,830 --> 01:14:14,266
The tools that burn spores
can also be used as weapons.

672
01:14:14,334 --> 01:14:18,236
We have no choice.
Release everything but their guns.

673
01:14:18,305 --> 01:14:20,000
The Korvet's taking off.

674
01:14:20,073 --> 01:14:21,631
Get through this time.

675
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:25,769
Summon all our troops
from Pejite to this valley.

676
01:14:25,845 --> 01:14:29,781
Good grief,
now this is a real mess.

677
01:14:29,849 --> 01:14:31,646
Hurry.

678
01:14:31,718 --> 01:14:33,310
Hurry.

679
01:14:35,355 --> 01:14:37,289
Find the Princess.

680
01:14:37,357 --> 01:14:38,756
Look after the valley.

681
01:14:38,825 --> 01:14:41,259
Be careful until we return.

682
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:48,324
We're going to the valley.

683
01:15:02,782 --> 01:15:05,842
It's no use,
the spores are already here.

684
01:15:05,919 --> 01:15:07,887
And on this side, too.

685
01:15:09,622 --> 01:15:12,056
- Move!
- What are you doing!

686
01:15:13,193 --> 01:15:15,388
Oh, no, here, too.

687
01:15:16,663 --> 01:15:18,790
Obaba.

688
01:15:18,865 --> 01:15:21,197
We've no choice but to burn it.

689
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:23,360
This forest is doomed.

690
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:28,373
If we hesitate, the Sea of Decay
will consume our valley.

691
01:15:29,542 --> 01:15:31,703
Isn't there anything to be done?

692
01:15:31,778 --> 01:15:35,214
This forest guarded
the reservoir for three centuries.

693
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:38,341
Damn! If only they'd never come.

694
01:15:45,658 --> 01:15:48,491
This is getting out of hand.

695
01:15:48,561 --> 01:15:49,994
Let's go help them.

696
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:05,573
You think so?

697
01:16:05,645 --> 01:16:08,273
I think it looks the same as ever.

698
01:16:09,883 --> 01:16:11,783
The insects have gone.

699
01:16:14,821 --> 01:16:18,450
I wonder why my heart's
pounding so hard.

700
01:16:18,525 --> 01:16:20,015
We're almost there.

701
01:16:20,093 --> 01:16:22,823
My friends are just
over that mountain.

702
01:16:42,615 --> 01:16:44,583
Pejite looks strange.

703
01:16:44,651 --> 01:16:46,175
What is that haze?

704
01:16:51,024 --> 01:16:52,321
Asbel, your mask.

705
01:16:55,462 --> 01:16:57,794
Insects! All dead.

706
01:16:57,864 --> 01:16:59,593
Head for Pejite.

707
01:16:59,666 --> 01:17:02,829
Be careful, the Tolmekian
army must be there.

708
01:17:54,821 --> 01:17:56,413
Even an ohmu...

709
01:17:56,489 --> 01:17:59,253
It attacked the Great Dome.

710
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:11,794
Pejite's finished.

711
01:18:11,871 --> 01:18:14,863
They wiped out the Tolmekians,
but this is...

712
01:18:14,941 --> 01:18:19,275
They wiped out?
What do you mean, Asbel?

713
01:18:21,314 --> 01:18:22,645
It's a Brig.

714
01:18:22,715 --> 01:18:26,276
My friends' ship!
They're landing, let's go!

715
01:18:37,363 --> 01:18:39,888
Asbel! You're alive!

716
01:18:39,966 --> 01:18:43,402
What have you done?
We can't rebuild it.

717
01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:45,437
You've seen the city.

718
01:18:45,505 --> 01:18:48,997
Don't worry, if the Sea of Decay
swallows it, we'll burn it away.

719
01:18:49,075 --> 01:18:51,134
But the Giant Warrior isn't here.

720
01:18:51,210 --> 01:18:53,144
I know, it's in the Valley of the Wind.

721
01:18:53,212 --> 01:18:54,440
How did...

722
01:18:55,982 --> 01:18:57,973
We haven't exactly been idle.

723
01:18:58,051 --> 01:19:00,178
We've launched our second phase.

724
01:19:00,253 --> 01:19:03,222
We'll wipe out the Tolmekians
in the valley tonight.

725
01:19:03,289 --> 01:19:04,688
What!

726
01:19:04,757 --> 01:19:07,385
What are you going to do?

727
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:09,223
Who's this, Asbel?

728
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:13,123
Nausicaa
from the Valley of the Wind.

729
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:14,427
I owe her my life.

730
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,434
Valley of the Wind...

731
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:18,470
Tell me, what will happen?

732
01:19:22,108 --> 01:19:25,407
You must know, Asbel!
Tell me.

733
01:19:26,946 --> 01:19:29,574
They'll provoke an insect attack.

734
01:19:29,649 --> 01:19:33,415
So you made them
attack Pejite, too!

735
01:19:37,056 --> 01:19:39,354
You're... horrible...

736
01:19:40,994 --> 01:19:45,590
We simply have to recover
the Giant Warrior before they revive it.

737
01:19:45,665 --> 01:19:48,634
We're doing it to save the world.

738
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:51,602
And so you'll murder
everyone in the Valley!

739
01:19:51,671 --> 01:19:54,834
Stop it! Call it off! Please!

740
01:19:54,907 --> 01:19:56,397
It's too late.

741
01:19:56,476 --> 01:19:59,138
Once they've started,
no one can stop them.

742
01:20:01,681 --> 01:20:05,811
We've lost most of our people
to the Tolmekians.

743
01:20:05,885 --> 01:20:08,319
This is the only way.

744
01:20:15,528 --> 01:20:18,326
Let go! Let me fly!

745
01:20:22,602 --> 01:20:26,470
It's horrible now, but the Giant Warrior
will purge the Sea of Decay

746
01:20:26,539 --> 01:20:28,302
and rebuild the human world.

747
01:20:28,374 --> 01:20:31,241
Liar! You're just like the Tolmekians.

748
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:33,744
No, they want to use it for destruction.

749
01:20:34,681 --> 01:20:37,172
You drink water from the wells, too.

750
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:40,413
Do you know what purifies that water?

751
01:20:40,486 --> 01:20:43,887
The trees in the Sea of Decay
cleanse all the lakes

752
01:20:43,956 --> 01:20:46,516
and rivers that humans polluted!

753
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:49,117
And you want to destroy that!

754
01:20:49,195 --> 01:20:51,527
Why did you dig up
that Giant Warrior!

755
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:53,724
What choice do we have?

756
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,791
Subject ourselves to Tolmekian rule?

757
01:20:55,868 --> 01:20:58,496
Never, never!
Tell them, Asbel,

758
01:20:58,571 --> 01:21:00,732
how the Sea of Decay came to be.

759
01:21:00,807 --> 01:21:02,798
How the insects protect this world!

760
01:21:04,143 --> 01:21:06,805
Please, Asbel!

761
01:21:06,879 --> 01:21:08,471
What are you doing!

762
01:21:08,548 --> 01:21:11,540
Don't move! Release her.

763
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:13,414
Calm down, Asbel.

764
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:17,389
I'm serious.
Release her.

765
01:21:17,457 --> 01:21:19,357
Nausicaa, go and warn them!

766
01:21:24,964 --> 01:21:26,955
Asbel! Let me go!

767
01:21:59,432 --> 01:22:01,866
Fools.

768
01:22:05,104 --> 01:22:07,504
No stopping fighting once it starts.

769
01:22:07,573 --> 01:22:09,541
But he warned us to be careful...

770
01:22:09,609 --> 01:22:13,170
Quit dawdling and use the tanks
to rescue our men.

771
01:22:13,246 --> 01:22:15,544
Counselor! They got the last man!

772
01:22:15,615 --> 01:22:17,139
Coming our way?

773
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:18,342
I don't know.

774
01:22:18,417 --> 01:22:20,442
The whole village is gathering.

775
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:24,513
Why do they go berserk
over a little forest or two?

776
01:22:24,590 --> 01:22:26,057
Just as it was with Pejite.

777
01:22:36,669 --> 01:22:38,159
They got our tank!

778
01:22:39,806 --> 01:22:41,273
Hurry, get it moving.

779
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:42,602
Don't panic.

780
01:22:42,675 --> 01:22:45,610
Incoming fire!

781
01:22:45,678 --> 01:22:46,906
Forward!

782
01:22:49,182 --> 01:22:50,581
Hurry up!

783
01:22:50,650 --> 01:22:52,208
Maybe this is it?

784
01:22:54,086 --> 01:22:55,610
It's moving!

785
01:22:55,688 --> 01:22:57,679
Which way?

786
01:23:03,863 --> 01:23:05,558
Forward, move forward.

787
01:23:05,631 --> 01:23:07,155
I know that.

788
01:23:16,576 --> 01:23:20,535
Damn! Mobilize all the tanks.

789
01:23:22,582 --> 01:23:25,449
She survived...

790
01:23:25,518 --> 01:23:28,316
So much for my dreams...

791
01:23:28,387 --> 01:23:29,547
Your Highness!

792
01:23:34,093 --> 01:23:35,822
We'll hold 'em off here.

793
01:23:35,895 --> 01:23:38,955
Lead everyone
to safety by Acid Lake.

794
01:23:39,031 --> 01:23:40,521
All right.

795
01:23:41,601 --> 01:23:45,503
It's just until the Princess
returns with the gun ship.

796
01:23:49,041 --> 01:23:52,033
Hurry, everyone!

797
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:54,204
Stop gawking and help me.

798
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:55,577
My aching back.

799
01:23:57,550 --> 01:24:00,713
The tanks are coming!

800
01:24:02,622 --> 01:24:05,819
- Hurry!
- I know that.

801
01:24:21,741 --> 01:24:22,833
Are you sure?

802
01:24:22,909 --> 01:24:23,898
It's a Pejite Brig.

803
01:24:23,976 --> 01:24:26,774
- I saw it peeking through the clouds.
- OK!

804
01:24:40,593 --> 01:24:43,528
Watch out, she's a wild one.

805
01:24:51,103 --> 01:24:52,593
Quickly.

806
01:24:54,206 --> 01:24:57,004
Nausicaa, you may go free.

807
01:24:57,076 --> 01:24:58,373
Go warn your Valley.

808
01:24:58,444 --> 01:25:01,345
Your glider
may get you there in time.

809
01:25:02,114 --> 01:25:03,911
It's waiting.

810
01:25:04,583 --> 01:25:07,074
Asbel told me everything.

811
01:25:07,153 --> 01:25:10,179
I'll take your place.
Put this on.

812
01:25:10,256 --> 01:25:11,917
You're...

813
01:25:11,991 --> 01:25:13,390
Lastel's mother.

814
01:25:15,594 --> 01:25:17,152
Thank you.

815
01:25:18,397 --> 01:25:20,558
I'm so very sorry.

816
01:25:20,633 --> 01:25:23,101
Everything we've done is wrong.

817
01:25:23,169 --> 01:25:24,158
Hurry!

818
01:25:32,211 --> 01:25:35,669
- What about her?
- She'll be all right, don't worry.

819
01:25:40,319 --> 01:25:41,946
Be careful.

820
01:25:42,021 --> 01:25:44,455
We've treated you so badly.

821
01:25:44,523 --> 01:25:46,684
Over here, Nausicaa.

822
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:48,691
Hurry.

823
01:25:49,762 --> 01:25:51,696
Thank you, everyone!

824
01:25:54,233 --> 01:25:56,258
Sorry it took so long.

825
01:25:58,304 --> 01:26:01,501
- Can you launch from here?
- I'll try.

826
01:26:08,614 --> 01:26:09,808
A Korvet!

827
01:26:12,752 --> 01:26:16,210
Take cover in the clouds!

828
01:26:20,259 --> 01:26:22,591
Stop firing!

829
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:30,259
Idiots! Nothing but wind
and lightning in there.

830
01:26:35,674 --> 01:26:38,700
It's useless! I've lost control!

831
01:26:46,419 --> 01:26:48,216
The ship is breaking apart.

832
01:26:48,287 --> 01:26:51,745
We have to leave
the clouds and fight.

833
01:26:57,163 --> 01:26:59,393
They were expecting us.

834
01:27:08,207 --> 01:27:09,538
What are they up to?

835
01:27:09,608 --> 01:27:12,839
Forcing us into the clouds
so they can board us.

836
01:27:28,761 --> 01:27:31,286
Here they come.
This is your last chance.

837
01:27:31,363 --> 01:27:32,921
No, I'll stay with you.

838
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:34,727
I can't abandon all those people

839
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,791
and the girl who took my place.

840
01:27:37,770 --> 01:27:39,237
Only you can save your people.

841
01:27:39,305 --> 01:27:42,900
Please, go, for our sakes!

842
01:27:53,686 --> 01:27:55,313
The ship is ours.

843
01:27:55,387 --> 01:27:57,821
Take no prisoners.
Destroy them.

844
01:28:02,828 --> 01:28:04,386
Go, Nausicaa!

845
01:28:05,431 --> 01:28:06,989
Asbel!

846
01:29:04,390 --> 01:29:06,824
Princess!

847
01:29:06,892 --> 01:29:08,359
Mito!

848
01:29:23,642 --> 01:29:25,269
Mito! Lord Yupa!

849
01:29:25,344 --> 01:29:26,675
Princess!

850
01:29:26,745 --> 01:29:29,680
Hurry, everyone's in!

851
01:29:29,748 --> 01:29:32,308
I'll engage the hook now.

852
01:29:32,384 --> 01:29:34,716
Lord Yupa, that red lever!

853
01:29:40,259 --> 01:29:43,717
This is their last stronghold.

854
01:29:48,567 --> 01:29:50,694
The door won't hold.

855
01:29:50,769 --> 01:29:54,967
Any time.
Show them some Pejite pride.

856
01:29:57,009 --> 01:30:00,001
What is that?
A bird?

857
01:30:00,079 --> 01:30:03,515
- A ship, a gun ship from the Valley.
- What!

858
01:30:11,724 --> 01:30:14,249
You...

859
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:24,196
It's Lord Yupa,
here's a chance for glory!

860
01:30:32,645 --> 01:30:35,614
Surrender,
your Korvet won't be back.

861
01:30:35,681 --> 01:30:36,943
This guy's tough.

862
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:45,008
Princess, you're crazy.
The engine'll blow.

863
01:30:45,454 --> 01:30:47,945
Just make it to the Valley.
Speed up!

864
01:30:50,726 --> 01:30:52,819
Dear God, God of the Wind.

865
01:30:52,895 --> 01:30:55,022
Please protect my people.

866
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:17,178
They won't budge.

867
01:31:17,253 --> 01:31:18,811
They're waiting for her return.

868
01:31:18,888 --> 01:31:20,014
Return?

869
01:31:20,089 --> 01:31:23,388
They believe that girl
will return with their gun ship.

870
01:31:23,459 --> 01:31:27,520
That gun ship's a pain.
It's our chance to attack.

871
01:31:27,596 --> 01:31:30,656
Do you know what that ship is?

872
01:31:30,733 --> 01:31:33,497
It's from before
the Seven Days of Fire.

873
01:31:33,569 --> 01:31:37,027
The one they say
went as far as the stars...

874
01:31:37,106 --> 01:31:39,939
It's too strong for our guns,

875
01:31:40,009 --> 01:31:41,738
but bury it in a hole...

876
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:44,040
I, too, wish to wait.

877
01:31:44,113 --> 01:31:49,210
If she really does return
from deep in the Sea of Decay...

878
01:31:49,285 --> 01:31:52,413
I'd like a chance
to really talk to her.

879
01:31:56,492 --> 01:31:58,983
Made up your minds?

880
01:31:59,061 --> 01:32:02,724
If you'll aid our attack,
I'll let you go.

881
01:32:02,798 --> 01:32:04,857
You want to end up like Pejite?

882
01:32:06,101 --> 01:32:08,763
You're a Princess, too.

883
01:32:08,837 --> 01:32:11,601
You're nothing like our Princess.

884
01:32:11,674 --> 01:32:13,574
Look at my hand.

885
01:32:13,642 --> 01:32:16,577
That's what King Jihl had.

886
01:32:16,645 --> 01:32:20,581
In six more months
it will be stone.

887
01:32:20,649 --> 01:32:23,117
But our Princess said,

888
01:32:23,185 --> 01:32:26,518
she liked these hands.

889
01:32:26,589 --> 01:32:30,582
They were the beautiful hands
of a hard worker.

890
01:32:30,659 --> 01:32:32,957
You want to live
with the Sea of Decay

891
01:32:33,028 --> 01:32:35,588
even as its toxins ravage you?

892
01:32:35,664 --> 01:32:41,102
You use fire.
We use it a bit, too.

893
01:32:41,170 --> 01:32:44,503
Too much fire
and nothing will grow.

894
01:32:44,573 --> 01:32:47,838
Fire can turn the forest
into ashes in a single day.

895
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:51,471
Water and wind
sustain a forest for 100 years.

896
01:32:51,547 --> 01:32:54,482
We like the water and the wind.

897
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:59,078
The sight of our forest
will grieve the Princess.

898
01:33:00,322 --> 01:33:02,847
Counselor, we await your orders.

899
01:33:02,925 --> 01:33:05,086
- Shut up.
- Yes sir.

900
01:33:09,231 --> 01:33:12,564
Who knows what happened,
but she sure looks cute.

901
01:33:12,635 --> 01:33:15,570
Let them go, Kurotowa!

902
01:33:15,638 --> 01:33:18,072
Huh? You want to wait?

903
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:20,074
Feed the soldiers.

904
01:33:20,142 --> 01:33:22,702
We attack in one hour.

905
01:33:24,647 --> 01:33:28,583
Food, huh?
Finally, a real meal.

906
01:33:28,651 --> 01:33:30,619
Someone's coming!

907
01:33:32,321 --> 01:33:33,618
It's Gol and the others.

908
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:39,685
What is it?

909
01:33:39,762 --> 01:33:40,956
There's no wind.

910
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:42,691
No wind?

911
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:46,928
You're right, the wind's stopped.

912
01:33:48,304 --> 01:33:49,635
Obaba, what is it?

913
01:33:49,705 --> 01:33:50,967
Obaba.

914
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:56,034
Someone...
Someone take me outside...

915
01:34:02,751 --> 01:34:04,514
The wind's never stopped before.

916
01:34:19,201 --> 01:34:21,999
Obaba, my ears hurt.

917
01:34:22,071 --> 01:34:26,508
The air...
The very air is thick with rage.

918
01:34:41,623 --> 01:34:42,954
We're close!

919
01:34:43,025 --> 01:34:46,153
We're clear of the Sea of Decay!
3 minutes to Acid Lake!

920
01:34:46,228 --> 01:34:49,197
Idle the engines.
Drop beneath the clouds.

921
01:34:57,740 --> 01:35:00,208
What's this glow!

922
01:35:02,010 --> 01:35:03,204
Ohmus!

923
01:35:20,763 --> 01:35:24,699
The Sea of Decay is spreading.
They're headed for the Valley.

924
01:35:24,767 --> 01:35:28,726
How did they stampede the ohmus...

925
01:35:33,609 --> 01:35:35,702
Someone's baiting them.

926
01:35:35,778 --> 01:35:38,838
Mito! Turn towards Sirius.

927
01:35:38,914 --> 01:35:40,381
Yes!

928
01:36:07,409 --> 01:36:10,071
It's there. Mito, a flare!

929
01:36:11,079 --> 01:36:12,569
Ready.

930
01:36:13,649 --> 01:36:14,980
Fire!

931
01:36:19,788 --> 01:36:21,119
What is that?

932
01:36:32,801 --> 01:36:34,860
How cruel...

933
01:36:34,937 --> 01:36:37,735
They're baiting them
with a baby.

934
01:36:37,806 --> 01:36:39,501
I'll shoot 'em down!

935
01:36:39,575 --> 01:36:41,099
No, Mito!

936
01:36:42,811 --> 01:36:45,279
Don't shoot!

937
01:36:50,018 --> 01:36:51,849
Why not! Why shouldn't I?

938
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:54,582
Kill the baby,
and the stampede will never end!

939
01:36:54,656 --> 01:36:58,183
What can we do!
They'll destroy the Valley.

940
01:36:58,260 --> 01:36:59,659
Calm down, Mito.

941
01:36:59,728 --> 01:37:02,526
Return the baby to them.
Let's try.

942
01:37:10,539 --> 01:37:14,270
- What are you doing, Princess!
- You go ahead and warn them.

943
01:37:15,177 --> 01:37:16,508
Princess!

944
01:37:16,578 --> 01:37:18,842
You're not even armed.

945
01:37:30,325 --> 01:37:32,054
That's not one of our flares.

946
01:37:32,127 --> 01:37:33,958
- How far?
- 20 leagues.

947
01:37:34,029 --> 01:37:35,553
The other side of the lake.

948
01:37:35,631 --> 01:37:37,360
Is it a gun ship?

949
01:37:37,432 --> 01:37:38,763
Probably.

950
01:37:46,775 --> 01:37:48,299
That's a distress signal.

951
01:37:48,377 --> 01:37:50,743
It's definitely the gun ship.

952
01:37:50,812 --> 01:37:52,643
It's been an hour, let's go.

953
01:37:52,714 --> 01:37:53,840
Why not wait?

954
01:37:53,916 --> 01:37:56,214
The bloodshed is inevitable.

955
01:38:02,758 --> 01:38:04,851
Infantry, advance.

956
01:38:09,765 --> 01:38:11,130
Your Highness, get inside.

957
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:12,632
I'm fine here.

958
01:38:19,641 --> 01:38:21,632
The gun ship!

959
01:38:23,946 --> 01:38:25,743
Fire!

960
01:38:35,290 --> 01:38:38,350
Hold your fire! Stop it! Stop!

961
01:38:41,296 --> 01:38:43,264
Princess!

962
01:38:43,332 --> 01:38:46,563
Stand-by. Don't fire.

963
01:38:46,635 --> 01:38:48,296
Your Highness.

964
01:38:51,907 --> 01:38:53,101
Where's the girl!

965
01:38:53,175 --> 01:38:55,939
- The Princess!
- She's not here.

966
01:38:56,011 --> 01:38:58,377
The ohmu, a stampede.
It's coming this way.

967
01:38:58,447 --> 01:39:00,347
- What!
- The ohmu!

968
01:39:00,415 --> 01:39:03,976
The Princess stayed behind
to stop them.

969
01:39:04,052 --> 01:39:06,486
This is no time for battle.

970
01:39:06,555 --> 01:39:09,888
Everyone run,
find the highest place you can! Now!

971
01:39:12,961 --> 01:39:16,397
Obaba, I see a red glow.

972
01:39:19,134 --> 01:39:20,829
It's spreading.

973
01:39:20,902 --> 01:39:22,426
It's coming this way.

974
01:39:22,504 --> 01:39:25,996
You hold on tight.

975
01:39:26,074 --> 01:39:29,942
There's no stopping them now.

976
01:39:30,012 --> 01:39:32,242
Don't panic.

977
01:39:32,314 --> 01:39:35,340
There's still time.

978
01:39:36,118 --> 01:39:39,952
If I have to die,
I want to die in the Valley.

979
01:39:40,022 --> 01:39:43,856
No, you mustn't give up,
not while the Princess has faith.

980
01:39:43,925 --> 01:39:46,723
Listen, hold them off
as long as you can.

981
01:39:46,795 --> 01:39:48,353
I'll return soon.

982
01:39:48,430 --> 01:39:51,593
Your Highness, not that...
It's not ready yet!

983
01:39:51,667 --> 01:39:54,500
If not now, when!

984
01:39:54,569 --> 01:39:55,729
Go!

985
01:40:00,876 --> 01:40:03,367
Don't shoot! Listen to me!

986
01:40:17,092 --> 01:40:19,287
Damn! She flies like a bird.

987
01:40:19,361 --> 01:40:22,330
She's not an enemy.
She wants to say something.

988
01:40:22,397 --> 01:40:25,025
Anyone who interferes is an enemy.

989
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:29,059
We'd better drop the bait
in the Valley soon, or die ourselves.

990
01:40:32,107 --> 01:40:35,076
Here she comes!
Let her come in close, then fire.

991
01:40:47,956 --> 01:40:49,514
Now! Fire!

992
01:40:49,591 --> 01:40:52,958
- No! That's Lastel!
- Move!

993
01:41:40,642 --> 01:41:41,973
Ohmu...

994
01:42:08,904 --> 01:42:11,737
Don't be angry.
Don't be frightened.

995
01:42:11,807 --> 01:42:13,365
I'm not your foe.

996
01:42:15,610 --> 01:42:17,544
I'm sorry.

997
01:42:17,612 --> 01:42:21,776
I'm sorry.
I can't ask your forgiveness.

998
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:23,408
It's too cruel.

999
01:42:33,595 --> 01:42:36,496
Don't move!
You'll bleed to death.

1000
01:42:36,565 --> 01:42:39,295
Be good, little one, keep still.

1001
01:42:49,110 --> 01:42:50,839
They've found us.

1002
01:42:50,912 --> 01:42:52,140
They're coming.

1003
01:42:53,615 --> 01:42:56,448
Stop! Not with those wounds!

1004
01:42:56,518 --> 01:42:58,713
The lake is poison...

1005
01:43:33,521 --> 01:43:34,749
You...

1006
01:44:02,851 --> 01:44:04,478
Good baby.

1007
01:44:04,552 --> 01:44:08,886
I'm fine.
They're coming for you.

1008
01:44:14,996 --> 01:44:17,396
They're turning away.

1009
01:44:18,833 --> 01:44:22,360
Ohmu! Don't!
The Valley's that way.

1010
01:44:26,041 --> 01:44:28,202
They've forgotten us in their rage.

1011
01:44:28,276 --> 01:44:30,244
If I don't calm them, the Valley...

1012
01:44:43,959 --> 01:44:46,928
Fools! Drawing them
with their own fire.

1013
01:44:46,995 --> 01:44:48,326
We're safe.

1014
01:44:48,396 --> 01:44:50,523
We'd better get away.
Check the engine.

1015
01:44:51,533 --> 01:44:53,558
No, no!

1016
01:44:53,635 --> 01:44:56,433
We can discuss this.

1017
01:44:56,504 --> 01:44:58,665
Take us to them.

1018
01:44:58,740 --> 01:45:00,571
I must give them the baby.

1019
01:45:00,642 --> 01:45:03,008
What's the point, it's too late.

1020
01:45:03,078 --> 01:45:04,943
They'll never stop.

1021
01:45:07,549 --> 01:45:10,382
Drop us in front of them, then.

1022
01:45:10,452 --> 01:45:11,544
Take us.

1023
01:45:12,487 --> 01:45:14,079
But you'll die, too.

1024
01:45:22,664 --> 01:45:25,895
Obaba, will we all die?

1025
01:45:25,967 --> 01:45:29,596
If that's our fate,
we must accept it.

1026
01:45:29,671 --> 01:45:31,400
They don't even waver.

1027
01:45:31,473 --> 01:45:32,565
Let's retreat.

1028
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:35,609
Idiot! There's nowhere to go.

1029
01:45:39,447 --> 01:45:42,143
Don't retreat!

1030
01:45:43,218 --> 01:45:45,243
Hold your ground
for Her Highness.

1031
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:46,480
Highness...

1032
01:45:46,554 --> 01:45:47,543
Your Highness!

1033
01:46:17,252 --> 01:46:20,187
Get them!

1034
01:46:20,255 --> 01:46:22,223
The Giant Warrior...
Giant Warrior.

1035
01:46:34,469 --> 01:46:36,994
It's rotting. It's too soon.

1036
01:46:44,879 --> 01:46:46,710
Burn them!

1037
01:46:46,781 --> 01:46:48,305
What's wrong?

1038
01:46:48,383 --> 01:46:51,841
Are you not descended
from Earth's most evil tribe!

1039
01:47:08,069 --> 01:47:11,732
Incredible...
No wonder the world caught fire.

1040
01:47:11,806 --> 01:47:14,331
Your Highness Kushana, hurray!

1041
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:27,717
Destroy them!

1042
01:47:27,789 --> 01:47:30,690
What's wrong with you?
Hurry up and fire!

1043
01:48:03,658 --> 01:48:05,558
We're done for.

1044
01:48:09,063 --> 01:48:11,054
The Giant Warrior is dead.

1045
01:48:11,132 --> 01:48:13,327
It's for the best.

1046
01:48:13,401 --> 01:48:17,462
The ohmu's rage
is the fury of the Earth itself.

1047
01:48:17,539 --> 01:48:21,566
There's no reason to live
if our lives depend on a monster.

1048
01:48:24,779 --> 01:48:27,748
- Princess!
- The Princess!

1049
01:48:37,659 --> 01:48:39,183
Not there.

1050
01:48:39,260 --> 01:48:40,955
- It's madness.
- Princess!

1051
01:49:52,333 --> 01:49:55,200
The ohmus are changing color.

1052
01:50:17,191 --> 01:50:19,489
Their rage has vanished.

1053
01:50:20,862 --> 01:50:23,490
They stopped. The ohmus stopped.

1054
01:50:41,182 --> 01:50:42,513
Princess!

1055
01:50:50,124 --> 01:50:53,753
The Princess is dead.

1056
01:50:53,828 --> 01:50:58,322
She calmed them
with her own life.

1057
01:50:58,399 --> 01:51:01,562
She saved our Valley.

1058
01:52:01,396 --> 01:52:02,693
Look...

1059
01:52:08,569 --> 01:52:11,333
What is that light?

1060
01:52:37,198 --> 01:52:38,358
Teto...

1061
01:52:54,348 --> 01:52:55,838
Wonderful.

1062
01:52:56,651 --> 01:52:58,983
Thank you, ohmu.

1063
01:52:59,053 --> 01:53:00,577
Thank you.

1064
01:53:19,807 --> 01:53:21,798
It's a miracle. A miracle.

1065
01:53:23,311 --> 01:53:26,838
Such friendship and sympathy.

1066
01:53:26,914 --> 01:53:30,441
The ohmus have opened their hearts.

1067
01:53:30,518 --> 01:53:36,320
Children, watch well and tell me
what I cannot see.

1068
01:53:36,390 --> 01:53:39,757
The Princess is wearing
strange blue clothes.

1069
01:53:41,362 --> 01:53:44,331
It's like she's walking
through golden fields.

1070
01:53:53,174 --> 01:53:55,734
"...clothed in blue robes,

1071
01:53:55,810 --> 01:54:00,247
"descending onto a golden field..."

1072
01:54:02,183 --> 01:54:03,741
Obaba...

1073
01:54:03,818 --> 01:54:08,255
The ancient legend was true.

1074
01:54:08,322 --> 01:54:10,415
Look!

1075
01:54:11,259 --> 01:54:12,590
The glider.

1076
01:54:12,660 --> 01:54:15,458
The wind!
The wind has returned.
