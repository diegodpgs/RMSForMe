1
00:00:40,104 --> 00:00:43,807
For more than a year, ominous rumors
had been privately circulating...

2
00:00:43,907 --> 00:00:46,310
among high-level Western leaders...

3
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,247
that the Soviet Union had been at work
on what was darkly hinted to be...

4
00:00:50,347 --> 00:00:54,018
the ultimate weapon:
a doomsday device.

5
00:00:54,118 --> 00:00:57,988
Intelligence sources traced the site
of the top-secret Russian project...

6
00:00:58,088 --> 00:01:00,758
to the perpetually
fog-shrouded wasteland...

7
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:04,228
below the Arctic peaks
of the Zhokhov Islands.

8
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:09,633
What they were building or why it was
located in a remote, desolate place...

9
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:11,997
no one could say.

10
00:03:42,286 --> 00:03:43,720
General Ripper, sir.

11
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,722
Group Captain Mandrake speaking.

12
00:03:45,822 --> 00:03:47,791
This is General Ripper speaking.

13
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:50,060
- Yes, sir.
- Do you recognize my voice?

14
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,529
I do, sir. Why do you ask?

15
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:54,364
Why do you think?

16
00:03:54,464 --> 00:03:58,035
I don't know, sir. We spoke
just a few moments ago, didn't we?

17
00:03:58,135 --> 00:04:03,340
You don't think I'd ask unless it was
pretty damned important, do you?

18
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,842
No, I don't.

19
00:04:04,942 --> 00:04:07,137
Let's see if we can stay on the ball.

20
00:04:08,078 --> 00:04:10,647
Has the Wing confirmed holding
at their fail-safe points?

21
00:04:10,747 --> 00:04:13,550
Yes, sir. The confirmations
have just come in.

22
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,254
Very well.
Now, listen to me carefully.

23
00:04:17,354 --> 00:04:20,123
The base is being put on condition red.

24
00:04:20,223 --> 00:04:22,426
I want this flashed
to all sections immediately.

25
00:04:22,526 --> 00:04:25,829
Condition red. Jolly good.
Keeps the men on their toes.

26
00:04:25,929 --> 00:04:28,193
This is not an exercise.

27
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:31,131
Not an exercise?

28
00:04:32,836 --> 00:04:37,441
I shouldn't tell you this, but you're
a good officer and have a right to know.

29
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,475
It looks like we're in a shooting war.

30
00:04:40,477 --> 00:04:45,415
- Oh, hell. Are the Russians involved?
- That's all I've been told.

31
00:04:45,515 --> 00:04:50,282
It came in on the red phone. I'm gonna
follow orders and seal this base tight.

32
00:04:51,388 --> 00:04:54,892
Now, I want you to transmit Plan R...

33
00:04:54,992 --> 00:04:56,894
R for Robert, to the Wing.

34
00:04:56,994 --> 00:05:00,364
- Plan R for Robert.
- Is it that bad, sir?

35
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:02,933
- Looks like it's pretty hairy.
- Yes, sir.

36
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:05,035
Plan R for Robert.

37
00:05:05,135 --> 00:05:08,438
Last and possibly most important...

38
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:12,743
I want all privately owned radios
to be immediately impounded.

39
00:05:12,843 --> 00:05:16,747
They might be used to issue
instructions to saboteurs.

40
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:19,683
As I previously arranged, Air Police
will have lists of all owners.

41
00:05:19,783 --> 00:05:23,754
I want every one collected
without exception.

42
00:05:23,854 --> 00:05:26,152
After you've done that,
report back to me.

43
00:05:53,283 --> 00:05:55,919
In order to guard against
surprise nuclear attack...

44
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:59,423
America's Strategic Air Command
maintains...

45
00:05:59,523 --> 00:06:03,627
a large force of B-52 bombers
airborne 24 hours a day.

46
00:06:03,727 --> 00:06:08,598
Each B-52 can deliver
a nuclear bomb load of 50 megatons...

47
00:06:08,698 --> 00:06:13,704
equal to 16 times the total
explosive force of all the bombs...

48
00:06:13,804 --> 00:06:18,342
and shells used by all the armies
in World War II.

49
00:06:18,442 --> 00:06:21,545
Based in America,
the Airborne Alert Force...

50
00:06:21,645 --> 00:06:24,414
is deployed from the Persian Gulf
to the Arctic Ocean.

51
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:27,284
But they have one geographical factor
in common.

52
00:06:27,384 --> 00:06:31,343
They are all two hours
from their targets inside Russia.

53
00:07:51,368 --> 00:07:54,337
Major Kong, I know you'll think
this is crazy...

54
00:07:54,437 --> 00:07:58,100
but I just got a message from base
over the C.R.M. 114.

55
00:07:59,176 --> 00:08:03,135
It decodes as Wing attack Plan R.
R for Romeo.

56
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:10,487
Goldie, did you say
Wing attack Plan R?

57
00:08:10,587 --> 00:08:12,111
Yes, sir, I have.

58
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:20,597
Goldie, how many times have
I told you guys that I don't want...

59
00:08:20,697 --> 00:08:22,599
horsin' around on the airplane?

60
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:24,935
I'm not horsing around.
That's how it decodes.

61
00:08:25,035 --> 00:08:27,671
I've been to one world fair,
a picnic...

62
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:31,608
and a rodeo, and that's the stupidest
thing I heard over earphones.

63
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,608
You sure you got today's code?

64
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:36,113
Yes, sir.

65
00:08:36,213 --> 00:08:38,748
There's gotta be something wrong.

66
00:08:38,848 --> 00:08:41,214
Wait a second, I'm coming back.

67
00:09:15,685 --> 00:09:19,322
Maybe you'd better get
a confirmation from base.

68
00:09:19,422 --> 00:09:20,855
Yes, sir.

69
00:09:41,978 --> 00:09:44,548
Major Kong, is it possible
this is some kind of loyalty test?

70
00:09:44,648 --> 00:09:48,285
You know, give the go code and then
recall to see who would actually go?

71
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:52,489
Ain't nobody ever got
the go code yet.

72
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:54,958
Old Ripper wouldn't be giving us
Plan R...

73
00:09:55,058 --> 00:09:57,661
unless them Ruskies had already
clobbered Washington...

74
00:09:57,761 --> 00:10:00,030
and a lot of other towns
with a sneak attack.

75
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,364
Yes, sir.

76
00:10:01,464 --> 00:10:03,955
Major Kong,
message from base confirmed.

77
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:11,171
Well, boys, I reckon this is it.

78
00:10:12,242 --> 00:10:15,507
Nuclear combat toe-to-toe
with the Ruskies.

79
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,429
Boys, I ain't much of a hand
at making speeches.

80
00:10:36,866 --> 00:10:40,136
But I got a fair idea
that something doggone important...

81
00:10:40,236 --> 00:10:42,205
is going on back there.

82
00:10:42,305 --> 00:10:46,142
I've got a fair idea of the kind
of personal emotions...

83
00:10:46,242 --> 00:10:49,679
that some of you fellows
may be thinking.

84
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:52,482
Heck, I reckon you wouldn't be
human beings...

85
00:10:52,582 --> 00:10:57,153
if you didn't have pretty strong
personal feelings about nuclear combat.

86
00:10:57,253 --> 00:11:00,156
I want you to remember one thing.

87
00:11:00,256 --> 00:11:02,993
The folks back home
are counting on you.

88
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:05,425
And by golly,
we ain't about to let them down.

89
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:09,532
Tell you something else.

90
00:11:09,632 --> 00:11:14,604
If this thing turns out to be half
as important as I figure it might be...

91
00:11:14,704 --> 00:11:18,708
I'd say you're all in line
for some important promotions...

92
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:22,579
and personal citations
when this thing's over with.

93
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:25,415
That goes for every last one of you...

94
00:11:25,515 --> 00:11:29,319
regardless of your race,
color or your creed.

95
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:32,980
Now let's get this thing on the hump.
We got some flying to do.

96
00:11:46,603 --> 00:11:48,805
Buck, should I get it?

97
00:11:48,905 --> 00:11:50,839
Yeah, you'll have to.

98
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,515
Hello?

99
00:11:58,615 --> 00:12:03,186
Yes, General Turgidson is here,
but he can't come to the phone now.

100
00:12:03,286 --> 00:12:05,550
This is his secretary, Miss Scott.

101
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:08,858
Freddie, how are you?

102
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,194
Fine. And you?

103
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:15,932
Oh, we were just catching up
on some of the general's paperwork.

104
00:12:16,032 --> 00:12:20,662
He's tied up.
I'm afraid he can't come to the phone.

105
00:12:21,738 --> 00:12:23,139
Just a minute.

106
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:26,476
General Turgidson,
a Colonel Puntrich calling.

107
00:12:26,576 --> 00:12:28,478
Tell him to call back.

108
00:12:28,578 --> 00:12:33,249
Freddie, the general says
could you call back in a minute?

109
00:12:33,349 --> 00:12:35,251
He says it can't wait.

110
00:12:35,351 --> 00:12:38,655
For Pete's--
Find out what he wants.

111
00:12:38,755 --> 00:12:42,625
The general is in the powder room
right now.

112
00:12:42,725 --> 00:12:44,989
Could you tell me what it's about?

113
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:50,500
Just a second. Apparently they monitored
a transmission eight minutes ago...

114
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,091
from Burpelson Air Force Base.

115
00:12:54,938 --> 00:13:00,001
Right. It was directed to
the 843rd Bomb Wing on airborne alert.

116
00:13:01,778 --> 00:13:05,215
It decoded as Wing attack Plan R.

117
00:13:05,315 --> 00:13:10,954
Well, tell him to call what's-his-name,
Base Commander Ripper.

118
00:13:11,054 --> 00:13:12,689
Do I have to think of everything?

119
00:13:12,789 --> 00:13:17,360
The general suggests you call General
Ripper, the 843rd base commander.

120
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,830
Oh. All communications are dead!

121
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,300
Bull! Tell him to do it himself.

122
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,305
The general asks if you could
possibly try again yourself.

123
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:34,043
I see. He says he's tried personally
several times, but everything is dead.

124
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:36,907
Even the normal phone lines
are shut down.

125
00:13:44,187 --> 00:13:47,020
Fred? Buck.
What's it look like?

126
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,058
Yeah?

127
00:13:51,494 --> 00:13:54,486
Well, are you sure
it's Plan R?

128
00:13:55,732 --> 00:13:58,401
Huh. What's cooking
on the threat board?

129
00:13:58,501 --> 00:14:01,299
Nothing? Nothing at all?

130
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:05,532
I don't like the look of this.

131
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,612
Tell you what you better do,
old buddy.

132
00:14:09,712 --> 00:14:12,849
You better give Elmo and Charlie a blast
and bump everything up to condition red.

133
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:15,485
Stand by the blower.
I'll get back to you.

134
00:14:15,585 --> 00:14:17,780
- What's up?
- Nothing.

135
00:14:19,355 --> 00:14:22,625
- Where's my shorts?
- On the floor. Where are you going?

136
00:14:22,725 --> 00:14:24,461
No place.

137
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:29,265
I thought I might mosey over to the
War Room to see what's doing over there.

138
00:14:29,365 --> 00:14:31,134
It's 3:00 in the morning.

139
00:14:31,234 --> 00:14:33,136
The air force never sleeps.

140
00:14:33,236 --> 00:14:37,172
Buck, honey, I'm not sleepy either.

141
00:14:39,842 --> 00:14:42,612
I know how it is, baby.

142
00:14:42,712 --> 00:14:44,737
Tell you what you do.

143
00:14:45,782 --> 00:14:49,719
You start your countdown
and old Bucky will be back...

144
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:53,380
before you can say "Blastoff!"

145
00:14:54,657 --> 00:14:58,753
Your Commie has no regard
for human life, not even his own.

146
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:03,733
For this reason, men, I want
to impress upon you the need...

147
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,902
for extreme watchfullness.

148
00:15:06,002 --> 00:15:10,006
The enemy may come individually
or he may come in strength.

149
00:15:10,106 --> 00:15:12,700
He may even come in the uniform
of our own troops.

150
00:15:13,676 --> 00:15:16,246
But however he comes,
we must stop him.

151
00:15:16,346 --> 00:15:19,110
We must not allow him
to gain entrance to this base.

152
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:24,554
Now, I am going to give you
three simple rules.

153
00:15:24,654 --> 00:15:29,125
First: Trust no one,
whatever his uniform or rank...

154
00:15:29,225 --> 00:15:31,694
unless he is known to you personally.

155
00:15:31,794 --> 00:15:34,631
Secondly: Anyone or anything...

156
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:39,602
that approaches within 200 yards
of the perimeter is to be fired upon.

157
00:15:39,702 --> 00:15:45,308
Third: If in doubt, shoot first
and ask questions afterwards.

158
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:48,745
I would sooner accept a few casualties
through accident...

159
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:52,949
than lose the entire base
and its personnel through carelessness.

160
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:57,179
Any variation on these rules
must come from me personally.

161
00:15:58,254 --> 00:16:01,057
Now, men, in conclusion...

162
00:16:01,157 --> 00:16:05,194
I would like to say
that in the two years...

163
00:16:05,294 --> 00:16:09,065
that it has been my privilege
to be your commanding officer...

164
00:16:09,165 --> 00:16:12,068
I have always expected
the best from you...

165
00:16:12,168 --> 00:16:16,039
and you have never given me
anything less than that.

166
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:19,506
Today the nation is counting on us.

167
00:16:20,576 --> 00:16:23,379
We are not going to let them down.

168
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:25,413
Good luck to you all.

169
00:16:55,611 --> 00:16:58,136
Here's the attack profile, sir.

170
00:17:25,908 --> 00:17:28,544
This is your attack profile.

171
00:17:28,644 --> 00:17:31,714
"To ensure that the enemy cannot monitor
voice transmission...

172
00:17:31,814 --> 00:17:33,950
or plant false transmission...

173
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:39,155
the C.R.M. 114 is to be switched
into all receiver circuits.

174
00:17:39,255 --> 00:17:42,692
The emergency base code prefix
is to be set...

175
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:45,161
on the dials of the C.R.M.

176
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:49,823
This will block any transmission other
than those preceded by a code prefix."

177
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,536
Stand by to set code prefix.

178
00:17:53,636 --> 00:17:56,072
Roger. Ready to set code prefix.

179
00:17:56,172 --> 00:17:58,037
"Set code prefix."

180
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,985
Code prefix set.

181
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:10,746
"Lock code prefix."

182
00:18:13,422 --> 00:18:14,824
Code prefix locked.

183
00:18:14,924 --> 00:18:18,416
"Switch all receiver circuits
to C.R.M. discriminators."

184
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:22,832
Switched to C.R.M. discriminators.

185
00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:24,797
"Check auto destruct circuits."

186
00:18:28,104 --> 00:18:30,038
Auto destruct circuits checked.

187
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:39,816
"Primary target:
the I.C.B.M. complex at Laputa.

188
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:44,120
Target reference:
Yankee, golf, tango...

189
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,255
3-6-0.

190
00:18:46,355 --> 00:18:48,257
Thirty megaton nuclear device...

191
00:18:48,357 --> 00:18:52,428
fused for air burst at 10,000 feet.

192
00:18:52,528 --> 00:18:56,999
Twenty megaton nuclear device
will be used if first malfunctions.

193
00:18:57,099 --> 00:18:59,736
Otherwise, proceed to secondary target:

194
00:18:59,836 --> 00:19:03,840
missile complex seven miles east
of Borchov.

195
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,877
Target reference:
November, Bravo, X-ray...

196
00:19:07,977 --> 00:19:10,413
1-0-8.

197
00:19:10,513 --> 00:19:15,815
Fused air burst at 10--"
Check-- "12,000 feet."

198
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:31,000
Excuse me, sir. Something rather
interesting has just cropped up.

199
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,933
Listen to that. Music.
Civilian broadcasting.

200
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:39,776
I think the Pentagon has given us
an exercise to check our readiness.

201
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:41,844
I think it's taking things too far.

202
00:19:41,944 --> 00:19:44,947
Our fellows will be inside Russian
radar cover in about 20 minutes.

203
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:48,278
Listen. Chock full of stations
all churning it out.

204
00:19:50,052 --> 00:19:51,788
- Mandrake?
- Yes, sir?

205
00:19:51,888 --> 00:19:55,291
I issued instructions for all radios
to be impounded.

206
00:19:55,391 --> 00:19:59,662
You did, and I was in the process of
impounding this when I switched it on.

207
00:19:59,762 --> 00:20:03,232
I thought our fellows hitting Russian
radar, dropping all their stuff...

208
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:07,770
I'd better tell you because if they do,
it'll cause a stink.

209
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,908
Group Captain,
the officer exchange program...

210
00:20:12,008 --> 00:20:15,611
does not give you any special
prerogatives to question my orders.

211
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:19,916
I realize that, sir, but I thought
you'd be pleased to hear the news.

212
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:22,752
After all, let's face it.

213
00:20:22,852 --> 00:20:26,845
We don't want to start a nuclear war
unless we have to, do we?

214
00:20:27,823 --> 00:20:31,460
Please sit down.
And turn that thing off.

215
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,662
Yes, sir.

216
00:20:32,762 --> 00:20:37,633
What about the planes? Surely we must
issue the recall code immediately.

217
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:40,570
The planes are not going
to be recalled.

218
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,537
My attack orders have been issued,
and the orders stand.

219
00:20:45,574 --> 00:20:49,712
If you'll excuse me for saying so,
that would be to my way of thinking...

220
00:20:49,812 --> 00:20:51,948
rather an odd way of looking at it

221
00:20:52,048 --> 00:20:54,417
If a Russian attack was in progress...

222
00:20:54,517 --> 00:20:58,421
we would certainly not be hearing
civilian broadcasting.

223
00:20:58,521 --> 00:21:01,357
- Are you certain?
- I'm absolutely positive.

224
00:21:01,457 --> 00:21:04,160
What if it is true?

225
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,286
I'm afraid I'm still not with you, sir,
because I mean...

226
00:21:08,864 --> 00:21:11,200
if a Russian attack
was not in progress...

227
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:15,669
then your use of Plan R-- In fact,
your orders to the entire Wing--

228
00:21:23,145 --> 00:21:28,412
I would say, sir, that there was
something dreadfully wrong somewhere

229
00:21:29,485 --> 00:21:31,821
Why don't you take it easy,
Group Captain?

230
00:21:31,921 --> 00:21:34,557
Please make me a drink
of grain alcohol and rainwater...

231
00:21:34,657 --> 00:21:37,091
and help yourself
to whatever you'd like.

232
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:50,206
General Ripper, sir, as an officer
in Her Majesty's Air Force...

233
00:21:50,306 --> 00:21:53,542
it is my clear duty
under the present circumstances...

234
00:21:53,642 --> 00:21:58,314
to issue the recall code upon my
own authority and bring back the Wing.

235
00:21:58,414 --> 00:22:00,405
If you'll excuse me, sir.

236
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:13,896
Sir, I must ask you for the key and the
recall code. Have you got them handy?

237
00:22:13,996 --> 00:22:16,465
I told you to take it easy,
Group Captain.

238
00:22:16,565 --> 00:22:19,101
There's nothing anybody can do now.

239
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:21,604
I'm the only person who knows
the three-letter code group.

240
00:22:21,704 --> 00:22:24,264
I must insist
that you give them to me!

241
00:22:33,349 --> 00:22:37,342
Do I take it, sir, you are threatening
a brother officer with a gun?

242
00:22:38,621 --> 00:22:43,726
Mandrake, I suppose
it never occurred to you...

243
00:22:43,826 --> 00:22:47,396
that while we're chatting here
so enjoyably...

244
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:51,334
a decision is being made
by the president...

245
00:22:51,434 --> 00:22:54,597
and the joint chiefs in the War Room
at the Pentagon.

246
00:22:55,671 --> 00:23:01,243
When they realize there is
no possibility of recalling the Wing...

247
00:23:01,343 --> 00:23:05,614
there will be only one course
of action open.

248
00:23:05,714 --> 00:23:07,614
Total commitment.

249
00:23:09,885 --> 00:23:14,322
Mandrake, do you recall what
Clemenceau once said about war?

250
00:23:15,624 --> 00:23:18,320
No, I don't think I do, sir. No.

251
00:23:19,995 --> 00:23:23,021
He said war was too important
to be left to the generals.

252
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,671
When he said that 50 years ago...

253
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:30,706
he might have been right.

254
00:23:30,806 --> 00:23:33,142
But today...

255
00:23:33,242 --> 00:23:36,679
war is too important
to be left to politicians.

256
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:41,217
They have neither the time,
the training...

257
00:23:41,317 --> 00:23:44,377
nor the inclination
for strategic thought.

258
00:23:48,023 --> 00:23:51,494
I can no longer sit back
and allow...

259
00:23:51,594 --> 00:23:56,732
Communist infiltration,
Communist indoctrination...

260
00:23:56,832 --> 00:23:58,459
Communist subversion...

261
00:23:59,935 --> 00:24:03,773
and the international
Communist conspiracy...

262
00:24:03,873 --> 00:24:06,709
to sap and impurify...

263
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:10,142
all of our precious
bodily fluids.

264
00:24:16,318 --> 00:24:17,787
Staines, is everybody here?

265
00:24:17,887 --> 00:24:20,356
Mr.President, the secretary of state
is in Vietnam.

266
00:24:20,456 --> 00:24:24,393
The secretary of defense is in Laos, and
the vice president is in Mexico City.

267
00:24:24,493 --> 00:24:29,432
We can establish contact with them at
anytime. The undersecretaries are here.

268
00:24:29,532 --> 00:24:32,626
Right. General Turgidson,
what's going on?

269
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,705
Mr.President...

270
00:24:36,805 --> 00:24:40,443
about 35 minutes ago...

271
00:24:40,543 --> 00:24:44,513
General Jack Ripper,
the commanding general...

272
00:24:44,613 --> 00:24:47,016
of Burpelson Air Force Base...

273
00:24:47,116 --> 00:24:50,352
issued an order to the 34 B-52s
of his Wing...

274
00:24:50,452 --> 00:24:52,555
which were airborne at the time...

275
00:24:52,655 --> 00:24:56,759
as part of a special exercise we were
holding called Operation Dropkick.

276
00:24:56,859 --> 00:25:01,530
It appears that the order
called for the planes...

277
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:04,967
to attack their targets
inside Russia.

278
00:25:05,067 --> 00:25:09,271
The planes are fully armed
with nuclear weapons...

279
00:25:09,371 --> 00:25:12,875
with an average load
of 40 megatons each.

280
00:25:12,975 --> 00:25:17,435
The central display of Russia will
indicate the position of the planes.

281
00:25:18,914 --> 00:25:22,118
The triangles
are their primary targets.

282
00:25:22,218 --> 00:25:25,153
The squares
are their secondary targets.

283
00:25:26,222 --> 00:25:31,524
The aircraft will begin penetrating
Russian radar cover within 25 minutes.

284
00:25:33,729 --> 00:25:36,999
General Turgidson, I find this
very difficult to understand.

285
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:42,366
I understood I was the only one
to order the use of nuclear weapons.

286
00:25:43,505 --> 00:25:47,576
That's right, sir. You are
the only person authorized to do so.

287
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:51,947
And although I hate to judge
before all the facts are in...

288
00:25:52,047 --> 00:25:55,651
it's beginning to look like
General Ripper exceeded his authority.

289
00:25:55,751 --> 00:26:00,589
It certainly does, far beyond the point
I would have imagined possible.

290
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:04,293
Perhaps you're forgetting
the provisions of Plan R, sir.

291
00:26:04,393 --> 00:26:06,224
Plan R?

292
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:11,167
Plan R is an emergency war plan...

293
00:26:11,267 --> 00:26:13,769
in which a lower echelon commander
may order...

294
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:16,972
nuclear retaliation
after a sneak attack...

295
00:26:17,072 --> 00:26:20,543
if the normal chain of command
has been disrupted.

296
00:26:20,643 --> 00:26:23,544
You approved it, sir.
You must remember.

297
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,884
Surely you must recall, sir,
when Senator Beaufort made...

298
00:26:28,984 --> 00:26:31,921
that big hassle about our deterrent
lacking credibility.

299
00:26:32,021 --> 00:26:36,725
The idea was for Plan R to be
a sort of retaliatory safeguard.

300
00:26:36,825 --> 00:26:38,794
A safeguard?

301
00:26:38,894 --> 00:26:42,131
I admit the human element seems
to have failed us here.

302
00:26:42,231 --> 00:26:45,601
But the idea was to discourage
the Ruskies from any hope...

303
00:26:45,701 --> 00:26:50,272
they could knock out Washington, and
yourself, as part of a sneak attack...

304
00:26:50,372 --> 00:26:54,543
and escape retaliation because of lack
of proper command and control.

305
00:26:54,643 --> 00:26:57,313
I assume the planes will return
automatically...

306
00:26:57,413 --> 00:26:59,438
once they reach their fail-safe points.

307
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:05,054
I'm afraid not. The planes were holding
at their fail-safe points...

308
00:27:05,154 --> 00:27:07,156
when the go code was issued.

309
00:27:07,256 --> 00:27:11,727
Once they fly beyond fail-safe, they do
not require a second order to proceed.

310
00:27:11,827 --> 00:27:13,729
They will continue
until they reach their target.

311
00:27:13,829 --> 00:27:16,889
Then why haven't you radioed the planes,
countermanding the go code?

312
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:21,570
We're unable to communicate
with any of the aircraft.

313
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,839
Why?

314
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:26,308
As you may recall, sir...

315
00:27:26,408 --> 00:27:30,012
one of the provisions
of Plan R provides...

316
00:27:30,112 --> 00:27:34,683
that once the go code
is received...

317
00:27:34,783 --> 00:27:38,087
the normal S.S.B. radios
in the aircraft...

318
00:27:38,187 --> 00:27:40,623
are switched into
a special coded device...

319
00:27:40,723 --> 00:27:43,759
which I believe is designated
as C.R.M. 114.

320
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:48,264
In order to prevent the enemy
from issuing fake or confusing orders...

321
00:27:48,364 --> 00:27:52,268
C.R.M. 114 is designed
not to receive at all...

322
00:27:52,368 --> 00:27:57,873
unless the message is proceeded by the
correct three-letter code group prefix.

323
00:27:57,973 --> 00:28:03,312
You mean to tell me you will be unable
to recall the aircraft?

324
00:28:03,412 --> 00:28:06,315
That's the size of it.
However, we are plowing through...

325
00:28:06,415 --> 00:28:09,285
every possible three-letter combination
of the code.

326
00:28:09,385 --> 00:28:14,556
But since there are
17,000 permutations...

327
00:28:14,656 --> 00:28:18,227
it's going to take us about two
and a half days to transmit them all.

328
00:28:18,327 --> 00:28:21,063
How soon will the planes penetrate
Russian radar cover?

329
00:28:21,163 --> 00:28:24,633
- About 18 minutes from now.
- Are you in contact with General Ripper?

330
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:29,605
No, sir. General Ripper sealed off
the base and cut off communications.

331
00:28:29,705 --> 00:28:31,307
Where did you get this information?

332
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:34,977
General Ripper called
Strategic Air Command Headquarters...

333
00:28:35,077 --> 00:28:37,579
shortly after he issued the go code.

334
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,283
I have a portion of the conversation
transcript if you'd like me to read it.

335
00:28:41,383 --> 00:28:43,146
Read it.

336
00:28:44,953 --> 00:28:47,690
The duty officer asked
General Ripper...

337
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:51,055
to confirm the fact that he had
issued the go code and he said:

338
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:56,332
"Yes, gentlemen, they are on their way
in and no one can bring them back.

339
00:28:56,432 --> 00:28:59,201
For the sake of our country
and our way of life...

340
00:28:59,301 --> 00:29:01,970
I suggest you get the rest of SAC
in after them.

341
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:06,942
Otherwise, we will be totally destroyed
by Red retaliation.

342
00:29:07,042 --> 00:29:12,314
My boys will give you the best kind
of start: 1,400 megatons worth.

343
00:29:12,414 --> 00:29:15,951
And you sure as hell
won't stop them now.

344
00:29:16,051 --> 00:29:18,887
So let's get going.
There's no other choice.

345
00:29:18,987 --> 00:29:23,826
God willing, we will prevail
in peace and freedom from fear...

346
00:29:23,926 --> 00:29:27,296
and in true health
through the purity...

347
00:29:27,396 --> 00:29:31,233
and essence of our natural...

348
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:32,766
fluids.

349
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:35,760
God bless you all."

350
00:29:37,706 --> 00:29:40,309
Then he hung up.

351
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:43,979
We're still trying to figure out
the meaning of that last phrase, sir.

352
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:48,384
There's nothing to figure out.
This man is obviously a psychotic.

353
00:29:48,484 --> 00:29:53,555
I'd like to hold off judgment
until all the facts are in.

354
00:29:53,655 --> 00:29:58,227
General Turgidson, when you instituted
the human reliability tests...

355
00:29:58,327 --> 00:30:02,263
you assured me there was no possibility
of such a thing ever occurring.

356
00:30:04,233 --> 00:30:08,270
Well, I don't think it's fair
to condemn a whole program...

357
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:11,006
because of a single slipup, sir.

358
00:30:11,106 --> 00:30:13,609
I want to speak to General Ripper
on the telephone.

359
00:30:13,709 --> 00:30:15,210
That's impossible.

360
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:19,181
General Turgidson, I am becoming
less and less interested...

361
00:30:19,281 --> 00:30:22,842
in your estimates
of what is possible and impossible.

362
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:25,421
General Faceman.

363
00:30:25,521 --> 00:30:26,655
Yes, sir?

364
00:30:26,755 --> 00:30:29,091
Are there any army units
stationed near Burpelson?

365
00:30:29,191 --> 00:30:31,250
I'll just check, sir.

366
00:30:36,098 --> 00:30:37,531
Hello?

367
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:42,332
I told you never to call me here.
Don't you know where I am?

368
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,376
Look, baby, I can't talk to you now.

369
00:30:47,476 --> 00:30:50,012
My president needs me.

370
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:53,741
Of course Bucky would rather
be there with you.

371
00:30:54,816 --> 00:30:57,953
Of course it isn't only physical.

372
00:30:58,053 --> 00:31:00,489
I deeply respect you
as a human being.

373
00:31:00,589 --> 00:31:03,683
Someday I'm going to make you
Mrs. Buck Turgidson.

374
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,763
Oh, listen, you go back to sleep.

375
00:31:07,863 --> 00:31:10,799
Bucky will be there as soon as he can.

376
00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:15,495
All right. Listen, don't forget
to say your prayers.

377
00:31:22,511 --> 00:31:26,415
Apparently,
the 23rd Airborne Division...

378
00:31:26,515 --> 00:31:29,318
is stationed seven miles away
at Alvarado.

379
00:31:29,418 --> 00:31:33,655
General Faceman, I want them to enter
the base, locate General Ripper...

380
00:31:33,755 --> 00:31:36,091
and put him in immediate
telephone contact with me.

381
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:37,793
Yes, sir.

382
00:31:37,893 --> 00:31:39,528
Mr.President?

383
00:31:39,628 --> 00:31:41,196
If I may advise.

384
00:31:41,296 --> 00:31:45,534
Under a condition red, it is standard
procedure that the base be sealed off...

385
00:31:45,634 --> 00:31:48,370
and the base defended
by base security troops.

386
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:52,875
Any force trying to enter would
certainly encounter heavy casualties.

387
00:31:52,975 --> 00:31:57,012
General Turgidson, with all due respect
for your defense team...

388
00:31:57,112 --> 00:31:59,842
my boys can brush them aside
without too much trouble.

389
00:32:00,782 --> 00:32:05,549
Mr.President, there are one or two
points I'd like to make, if I may?

390
00:32:06,588 --> 00:32:08,021
Go ahead, General.

391
00:32:09,524 --> 00:32:14,162
One: Our hopes for recalling
the 843rd Bomb Wing...

392
00:32:14,262 --> 00:32:18,534
are quickly being reduced
to a very low order of probability.

393
00:32:18,634 --> 00:32:21,637
Two: In less than 15 minutes
from now...

394
00:32:21,737 --> 00:32:24,706
the Ruskies will be making
radar contact with the planes.

395
00:32:24,806 --> 00:32:26,775
Three: When they do...

396
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:30,479
they will go absolutely ape and
strike back with everything they've got.

397
00:32:30,579 --> 00:32:34,449
Four: If prior to this time...

398
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:37,986
we have done nothing to suppress
their retaliatory capabilities...

399
00:32:38,086 --> 00:32:41,749
we will suffer virtual annihilation.

400
00:32:44,826 --> 00:32:49,490
Five: If, on the other hand...

401
00:32:51,366 --> 00:32:56,672
we immediately launched an attack
on their airfields and missile bases...

402
00:32:56,772 --> 00:32:59,942
we'd stand a damn good chance
of catching them with their pants down.

403
00:33:00,042 --> 00:33:02,377
Hell, we've got
a five-to-one missile superiority.

404
00:33:02,477 --> 00:33:05,213
We could easily assign three missiles
to every target...

405
00:33:05,313 --> 00:33:08,684
and still have a very effective reserve
force for any other contingency.

406
00:33:08,784 --> 00:33:14,122
Six: An unofficial study which
we undertook of this eventuality...

407
00:33:14,222 --> 00:33:19,127
indicated that we would destroy
90% of their nuclear capabilities.

408
00:33:19,227 --> 00:33:21,330
We would therefore prevail...

409
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:24,600
and suffer only modest and acceptable
civilian casualties...

410
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,104
from their remaining force which would
be badly damaged and uncoordinated.

411
00:33:29,204 --> 00:33:32,641
General, it is the avowed policy
of our country...

412
00:33:32,741 --> 00:33:34,876
never to strike first
with nuclear weapons.

413
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:39,648
Well, Mr.President, General Ripper
has already invalidated that policy.

414
00:33:39,748 --> 00:33:44,185
That was not an act of national policy.
There are still alternatives open to us.

415
00:33:45,187 --> 00:33:49,992
Mr.President, we are rapidly
approaching a moment of truth...

416
00:33:50,092 --> 00:33:53,228
both for ourselves as human beings
and for the life of our nation.

417
00:33:53,328 --> 00:33:55,931
Truth is not always a pleasant thing.

418
00:33:56,031 --> 00:33:58,567
But it is necessary now
to make a choice:

419
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:01,403
to choose between two admittedly
regrettable...

420
00:34:01,503 --> 00:34:04,940
but nevertheless distinguishable
postwar environments.

421
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,811
One, where 20 million people are killed;
the other, 150 people killed.

422
00:34:09,911 --> 00:34:12,848
You're talking about mass murder,
General, not war.

423
00:34:12,948 --> 00:34:16,518
Mr.President, I'm not saying
we wouldn't get our hair mussed.

424
00:34:16,618 --> 00:34:21,223
But I do say no more than
10 to 20 million killed. Tops!

425
00:34:21,323 --> 00:34:23,291
Depending on the breaks.

426
00:34:23,391 --> 00:34:27,362
I will not go down in history as
the greatest mass murderer since Hitler!

427
00:34:27,462 --> 00:34:30,032
It might be better
if you were more concerned...

428
00:34:30,132 --> 00:34:33,435
with the American people than
with your image in the history books.

429
00:34:33,535 --> 00:34:36,538
General Turgidson,
I've heard quite sufficient from you.

430
00:34:36,638 --> 00:34:39,007
Thank you very much.

431
00:34:39,107 --> 00:34:41,643
Mr.President, they have
the ambassador waiting upstairs.

432
00:34:41,743 --> 00:34:45,347
- Good. Any difficulty?
- He's having a fit about the M.P.s.

433
00:34:45,447 --> 00:34:47,883
That can't be helped.
Have him brought here straightaway.

434
00:34:47,983 --> 00:34:49,518
Yes, sir.

435
00:34:49,618 --> 00:34:52,120
Is that the Russian ambassador?

436
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,313
Yes, it is, General.

437
00:34:56,424 --> 00:34:59,361
Am I to understand
the Russian ambassador...

438
00:34:59,461 --> 00:35:01,797
is to be admitted entrance
to the War Room?

439
00:35:01,897 --> 00:35:04,764
That is correct.
He is here on my orders.

440
00:35:07,669 --> 00:35:09,838
I don't know exactly how
to put this, sir...

441
00:35:09,938 --> 00:35:13,341
but are you aware of what a breach
of security that would be?

442
00:35:13,441 --> 00:35:17,605
He'll see everything.
He'll see the big board.

443
00:35:18,547 --> 00:35:20,849
That is precisely the idea, General.

444
00:35:20,949 --> 00:35:23,179
That is precisely the idea.

445
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:28,621
Staines, get Premier Kissoff
on the hot line.

446
00:35:35,764 --> 00:35:39,634
"Survival kit contents check.

447
00:35:39,734 --> 00:35:44,639
In them you will find
one .45 caliber automatic...

448
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:47,209
two boxes of ammunition...

449
00:35:47,309 --> 00:35:50,545
four days concentrated
emergency rations...

450
00:35:50,645 --> 00:35:53,949
one drug issue
containing antibiotics...

451
00:35:54,049 --> 00:35:58,353
morphine, vitamin pills,
pep pills...

452
00:35:58,453 --> 00:36:02,224
sleeping pills,
tranquilizer pills...

453
00:36:02,324 --> 00:36:07,129
one miniature combination
Russian phrase book and Bible...

454
00:36:07,229 --> 00:36:10,232
$100 in rubles...

455
00:36:10,332 --> 00:36:12,434
$100 in gold...

456
00:36:12,534 --> 00:36:15,270
nine packs of chewing gum...

457
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,272
one issue of prophylactics...

458
00:36:17,372 --> 00:36:21,376
three lipsticks,
three pair of nylon stockings."

459
00:36:21,476 --> 00:36:26,209
Shoot, a fellow could have a pretty
good weekend in Vegas with that stuff.

460
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,556
- You don't have any fresh fish?
- I'm afraid not, sir.

461
00:36:34,656 --> 00:36:36,825
- Your eggs are fresh?
- Yes, sir.

462
00:36:36,925 --> 00:36:40,862
I will have poached eggs. And bring me
some cigars, please. Havana cigars.

463
00:36:40,962 --> 00:36:44,332
That will be all, sir?
I'll see to it right away.

464
00:36:44,432 --> 00:36:47,602
Try one of these Jamaican cigars,
Ambassador. They're good.

465
00:36:47,702 --> 00:36:51,139
Thank you, no. I do not support the work
of imperialist stooges.

466
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:53,809
Oh, only Commie stooges, huh?

467
00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:55,467
Mr.President.

468
00:36:57,345 --> 00:37:00,615
You're gonna let that lousy Commie punk
vomit all over us like this?

469
00:37:00,715 --> 00:37:01,783
Mr.President?

470
00:37:01,883 --> 00:37:05,620
They haven't reached Premier Kissoff.
They don't know where he is...

471
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,120
and he won't be back for two hours.

472
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,660
Try B-8-6-5-4-3 Moscow.

473
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,829
You would never have found him
through his office.

474
00:37:13,929 --> 00:37:17,933
Our premier is a man of the people,
but he is also a man, if you follow.

475
00:37:18,033 --> 00:37:20,702
- Degenerate atheistic Commie.
- What did you say?

476
00:37:20,802 --> 00:37:24,339
I said Premier Kissoff is
a degenerate atheistic Commie!

477
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:27,342
- Have this ignorant fool--
- I'm sorry!

478
00:37:27,442 --> 00:37:31,378
Mr.President,
I think they're trying the number.

479
00:37:42,023 --> 00:37:45,126
Gentlemen, you can't fight in here.
This is the War Room!

480
00:37:45,226 --> 00:37:48,029
What is going on here?
I demand an explanation.

481
00:37:48,129 --> 00:37:52,367
This clumsy fool tried to plant
that ridiculous camera on me.

482
00:37:52,467 --> 00:37:55,036
You bet your sweets, Mr.Commie!
Look at this, Mr.President.

483
00:37:55,136 --> 00:37:58,731
This lousy Commie rat was taking
pictures with this of the big board!

484
00:37:59,808 --> 00:38:01,643
Mr.Ambassador!

485
00:38:01,743 --> 00:38:05,981
This clumsy fool attempted to plant
that ridiculous camera on me.

486
00:38:06,081 --> 00:38:08,917
That's a damn lie!
I saw him with my own eyes.

487
00:38:09,017 --> 00:38:13,188
This is outrageous. I have never heard
of such behavior in the War Room before.

488
00:38:13,288 --> 00:38:15,779
Mr.President, I think
they're getting him on the line.

489
00:38:43,785 --> 00:38:45,687
You got to hand it to those Commies.

490
00:38:45,787 --> 00:38:50,292
Yeah. Those trucks sure look like
the real thing, don't they?

491
00:38:50,392 --> 00:38:52,294
I wonder where they got them from.

492
00:38:52,394 --> 00:38:54,658
Probably bought them
from the army as war surplus.

493
00:38:58,366 --> 00:39:02,427
Okay, open up at 200 yards.

494
00:39:59,661 --> 00:40:03,298
Tell him where you are and that
you'll speak if I say anything untrue...

495
00:40:03,398 --> 00:40:05,696
but nothing more than that.

496
00:40:07,302 --> 00:40:10,703
Alexi? Alexi, please.
I beg you.

497
00:40:11,773 --> 00:40:14,342
But I don't have a phone.

498
00:40:14,442 --> 00:40:17,002
Give him the phone.

499
00:40:43,805 --> 00:40:48,174
I've done as you asked.
Be careful. I think he is drunk.

500
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:55,617
Hello? Hello, Dimitri?

501
00:40:55,717 --> 00:40:58,086
Listen, I can't hear too well.

502
00:40:58,186 --> 00:41:01,423
Could you turn the music down
a little?

503
00:41:01,523 --> 00:41:03,425
That's much better.

504
00:41:03,525 --> 00:41:06,153
Yeah. Yeah.

505
00:41:07,428 --> 00:41:10,198
Fine. I can hear you now, Dimitri.

506
00:41:10,298 --> 00:41:13,768
Clear and plain
and coming through fine.

507
00:41:13,868 --> 00:41:18,239
I'm coming through fine, too, eh?
Good.

508
00:41:18,339 --> 00:41:22,277
Well, then, as you say,
we're both coming through fine. Good.

509
00:41:22,377 --> 00:41:24,279
It's good that you're fine...

510
00:41:24,379 --> 00:41:26,614
and I'm fine.

511
00:41:26,714 --> 00:41:29,945
I agree with you.
It's great to be fine.

512
00:41:30,852 --> 00:41:33,021
Now, Dimitri...

513
00:41:33,121 --> 00:41:38,793
you know how we've always talked
about the possibility...

514
00:41:38,893 --> 00:41:41,589
of something going wrong
with the bomb.

515
00:41:42,964 --> 00:41:44,932
The bomb, Dimitri.

516
00:41:46,134 --> 00:41:48,736
The hydrogen bomb.

517
00:41:48,836 --> 00:41:51,773
Well, now, what happened is...

518
00:41:51,873 --> 00:41:56,077
one of our base commanders,
he had a sort of--

519
00:41:56,177 --> 00:41:59,380
Well, he went a little funny
in the head.

520
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,550
You know, just a little funny.

521
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:06,279
And he went and did a silly thing.

522
00:42:07,355 --> 00:42:09,257
I'll tell you what he did.

523
00:42:09,357 --> 00:42:11,689
He ordered his planes...

524
00:42:13,361 --> 00:42:15,797
to attack your country.

525
00:42:15,897 --> 00:42:18,297
Let me finish, Dimitri.

526
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,236
Let me finish, Dimitri.

527
00:42:21,336 --> 00:42:24,506
Listen, how do you think
I feel about it?

528
00:42:24,606 --> 00:42:27,473
Can you imagine how I feel
about it, Dimitri?

529
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:31,146
Why do you think I'm calling you?

530
00:42:31,246 --> 00:42:33,271
Just to say hello?

531
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:36,718
Of course I like to speak to you!

532
00:42:36,818 --> 00:42:39,320
Of course I like to say hello!

533
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,589
Not now, but anytime, Dimitri.

534
00:42:41,689 --> 00:42:45,693
I'm just calling up to tell you
something terrible has happened.

535
00:42:45,793 --> 00:42:48,763
Of course, it's a friendly call.

536
00:42:48,863 --> 00:42:53,129
Listen, if it wasn't friendly,
you probably wouldn't have even got it.

537
00:42:55,436 --> 00:43:00,175
They will not reach their targets
for at least another hour.

538
00:43:00,275 --> 00:43:03,344
I am positive, Dimitri.

539
00:43:03,444 --> 00:43:05,847
I've been all over this
with your ambassador.

540
00:43:05,947 --> 00:43:08,416
It is not a trick.

541
00:43:08,516 --> 00:43:09,951
I'll tell you.

542
00:43:10,051 --> 00:43:13,855
We'd like to give your Air Staff
a complete rundown on the targets...

543
00:43:13,955 --> 00:43:17,192
the flight plans
and defensive systems of the planes.

544
00:43:17,292 --> 00:43:22,197
Yes, if we're unable
to recall the planes...

545
00:43:22,297 --> 00:43:24,959
I'd say, well...

546
00:43:26,367 --> 00:43:30,705
we're just gonna have to help you
destroy them, Dimitri.

547
00:43:30,805 --> 00:43:33,708
I know they're our boys.

548
00:43:33,808 --> 00:43:36,333
Listen. Now, who should we call?

549
00:43:38,179 --> 00:43:42,673
Who should we call?
Sorry, you faded away.

550
00:43:43,885 --> 00:43:47,722
The Peoples Central
Air Defense Headquarters.

551
00:43:47,822 --> 00:43:50,091
Where is that, Dimitri?

552
00:43:50,191 --> 00:43:52,318
In Omsk. Right.

553
00:43:53,394 --> 00:43:54,629
Yes.

554
00:43:54,729 --> 00:43:57,630
You'll call them first, will you?

555
00:43:59,133 --> 00:44:02,068
Do you happen to have the phone number
on you, Dimitri?

556
00:44:03,938 --> 00:44:06,930
What? I see.
Just ask for Omsk information.

557
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:13,114
I'm sorry too, Dimitri.
I'm very sorry.

558
00:44:13,214 --> 00:44:17,048
All right, you're sorrier than I am.
But I am sorry as well.

559
00:44:19,354 --> 00:44:21,589
I am as sorry as you are, Dimitri.

560
00:44:21,689 --> 00:44:23,625
Don't say that you're more sorry
than I am...

561
00:44:23,725 --> 00:44:26,628
because I'm capable of being
just as sorry as you are.

562
00:44:26,728 --> 00:44:28,630
So we're both sorry, all right?

563
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:30,163
All right.

564
00:44:31,399 --> 00:44:35,665
Yes, he's right here. Yes, he wants
to talk to you. Just a second.

565
00:44:48,216 --> 00:44:49,911
What?

566
00:45:08,603 --> 00:45:11,439
What? What is it? What?

567
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:14,565
The fools. The mad fools.

568
00:45:15,977 --> 00:45:18,112
What's happened?

569
00:45:18,212 --> 00:45:20,515
The doomsday machine.

570
00:45:20,615 --> 00:45:23,151
The doomsday machine?
What is that?

571
00:45:23,251 --> 00:45:28,623
A device which will destroy
all human and animal life on Earth.

572
00:45:28,723 --> 00:45:30,987
All human and animal life?

573
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,138
- Mandrake?
- Yes, Jack?

574
00:45:49,444 --> 00:45:53,014
Have you ever seen a Commie
drink a glass of water?

575
00:45:53,114 --> 00:45:57,676
Well, I can't say I have, Jack.

576
00:45:58,886 --> 00:46:03,725
Vodka. That's what they drink,
isn't it? Never water.

577
00:46:03,825 --> 00:46:08,196
I believe that's what they drink, yes.

578
00:46:08,296 --> 00:46:11,733
On no account will a Commie
ever drink water...

579
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:14,165
and not without good reason.

580
00:46:15,236 --> 00:46:17,872
Oh, yes.

581
00:46:17,972 --> 00:46:23,035
I can't quite see
what you're getting at.

582
00:46:24,178 --> 00:46:27,375
Water. That's what I'm getting at.
Water.

583
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:32,374
Mandrake, water is the source
of all life.

584
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:37,492
Seven-tenths of this Earth's surface
is water.

585
00:46:37,592 --> 00:46:40,895
Why, do you realize that...

586
00:46:40,995 --> 00:46:44,031
70% of you is water?

587
00:46:44,131 --> 00:46:45,533
Good Lord.

588
00:46:45,633 --> 00:46:50,738
And as human beings,
you and I need fresh, pure water...

589
00:46:50,838 --> 00:46:54,409
to replenish
our precious bodily fluids.

590
00:46:54,509 --> 00:46:57,239
- You beginning to understand?
- Yes.

591
00:47:04,585 --> 00:47:09,824
Have you never wondered why I drink
only distilled water...

592
00:47:09,924 --> 00:47:14,295
or rainwater,
and only pure grain alcohol?

593
00:47:14,395 --> 00:47:17,694
It did occur to me, Jack, yes.

594
00:47:18,799 --> 00:47:22,758
Have you ever heard of fluoridation
of water?

595
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:27,642
Yes, I have heard of that, Jack, yes.

596
00:47:27,742 --> 00:47:29,644
Do you know what it is?

597
00:47:29,744 --> 00:47:32,847
No, no, I don't know what it is.

598
00:47:32,947 --> 00:47:36,851
Do you realize that fluoridation...

599
00:47:36,951 --> 00:47:39,754
is the most monstrously conceived...

600
00:47:39,854 --> 00:47:42,652
and dangerous Communist plot
we have ever had to face?

601
00:47:49,063 --> 00:47:51,031
Two can play at that game, soldier.

602
00:47:56,137 --> 00:47:58,867
That's nice shooting, soldier!

603
00:48:23,331 --> 00:48:25,366
Mandrake, come here.

604
00:48:25,466 --> 00:48:27,468
You calling me, Jack?

605
00:48:27,568 --> 00:48:30,002
Come over here
and help me with this belt.

606
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,010
I haven't had very much experience...

607
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:38,880
with those sort of machines.

608
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:42,750
I've only ever pressed a button
in my old Spitfire.

609
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:46,454
In the name of Her Majesty and the
Continental Congress, feed me this belt.

610
00:48:46,554 --> 00:48:51,292
Jack, I'd love to come,
but what's happened, you see...

611
00:48:51,392 --> 00:48:54,190
the string in my leg is gone.

612
00:48:55,262 --> 00:48:59,033
- The what?
- The string. I never told you.

613
00:48:59,133 --> 00:49:03,035
I've got a gammy leg.
Oh, dear. Gone. Shot off.

614
00:49:05,172 --> 00:49:08,835
Mandrake, come over here.
The redcoats are coming.

615
00:49:09,944 --> 00:49:14,081
When it is detonated, it will produce
enough radioactive fallout...

616
00:49:14,181 --> 00:49:16,083
so that in ten months...

617
00:49:16,183 --> 00:49:19,253
the surface of the Earth
will be as dead as the moon!

618
00:49:19,353 --> 00:49:22,290
Come on, De Sadesky!
That's ridiculous!

619
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:26,494
Our studies show even the worst fallout
is down to a safe level after two weeks.

620
00:49:26,594 --> 00:49:31,599
- You never heard of cobalt theoium G.
- What about it?

621
00:49:31,699 --> 00:49:35,770
Cobalt thorium G has
a radioactive half-life of 93 years.

622
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:38,940
If you take 50 H bombs
in the 100 megaton range...

623
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,409
and jacket them
with cobalt thorium G...

624
00:49:41,509 --> 00:49:46,113
when they are exploded,
they will produce a doomsday shroud...

625
00:49:46,213 --> 00:49:48,482
a lethal cloud of radioactivity...

626
00:49:48,582 --> 00:49:52,987
which will encircle the Earth
for 93 years!

627
00:49:53,087 --> 00:49:56,648
What a load of Commie bull.
I mean, after all.

628
00:49:57,725 --> 00:50:00,361
I'm afraid I don't understand
something, Alexi.

629
00:50:00,461 --> 00:50:04,065
Is the premier threatening to explode it
if our planes carry out their attack?

630
00:50:04,165 --> 00:50:06,701
No, sir. It is not a thing
a sane man would do.

631
00:50:06,801 --> 00:50:09,704
The doomsday machine is designed
to trigger itself automatically.

632
00:50:09,804 --> 00:50:12,039
Surely you can disarm it somehow.

633
00:50:12,139 --> 00:50:16,043
It is designed to explode if
any attempt is made to un-trigger it.

634
00:50:16,143 --> 00:50:17,378
Automatically?

635
00:50:17,478 --> 00:50:20,047
It's a Commie trick!
We're wasting valuable time!

636
00:50:20,147 --> 00:50:23,217
Look at the big board!
They're getting ready to clobber us!

637
00:50:23,317 --> 00:50:27,955
This is absolute madness.
Why should you build such a thing?

638
00:50:28,055 --> 00:50:29,991
There are those of us
who fought against it.

639
00:50:30,091 --> 00:50:32,126
But in the end, we could not keep up
with the expense involved...

640
00:50:32,226 --> 00:50:36,731
in the arms race, the space race
and the peace race.

641
00:50:36,831 --> 00:50:42,036
At the same time, our people grumbled
for more nylons and washing machines.

642
00:50:42,136 --> 00:50:44,672
Our doomsday scheme cost us
just a small fraction...

643
00:50:44,772 --> 00:50:47,975
of what we have been spending on defense
in a single year.

644
00:50:48,075 --> 00:50:52,480
The deciding factor was when we learned
your country was working similarly...

645
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,482
and we were afraid of a doomsday gap!

646
00:50:54,582 --> 00:50:57,918
This is preposterous! I've never
approved of anything like that.

647
00:50:58,018 --> 00:51:00,821
Our source was The New York Times.

648
00:51:00,921 --> 00:51:04,792
Dr.Strangelove, do we have anything
like that in the works?

649
00:51:04,892 --> 00:51:07,360
A moment, please, Mr.President.

650
00:51:10,097 --> 00:51:13,501
Under the authority granted me...

651
00:51:13,601 --> 00:51:17,738
as director of weapons research
and development...

652
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:22,009
I commissioned last year
a study of this project...

653
00:51:22,109 --> 00:51:24,311
by the Bland Corporation.

654
00:51:24,411 --> 00:51:27,548
Based on the findings of the report...

655
00:51:27,648 --> 00:51:33,120
my conclusion was that this idea
was not a practical deterrent...

656
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:37,024
for reasons which at this moment
must be all too obvious.

657
00:51:37,124 --> 00:51:40,525
You mean it is possible for them
to have built such a thing?

658
00:51:44,698 --> 00:51:49,537
Mr.President, the technology required
is easily within the means...

659
00:51:49,637 --> 00:51:54,008
of even the smallest nuclear power.

660
00:51:54,108 --> 00:51:58,067
It requires only the will to do so.

661
00:51:59,079 --> 00:52:02,917
But how is it possible for this thing
to be triggered automatically...

662
00:52:03,017 --> 00:52:05,319
and at the same time
impossible to un-trigger?

663
00:52:05,419 --> 00:52:09,423
Mr.President,
it is not only possible...

664
00:52:09,523 --> 00:52:11,425
it is essential.

665
00:52:11,525 --> 00:52:15,930
That is the whole idea
of this machine, you know.

666
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:21,202
Deterrence is the art of producing
in the mind of the enemy...

667
00:52:21,302 --> 00:52:23,871
the fear of attack.

668
00:52:23,971 --> 00:52:28,876
And so because of the automated and
irrevocable decision-making process...

669
00:52:28,976 --> 00:52:32,847
which rules out human meddling...

670
00:52:32,947 --> 00:52:36,884
the doomsday machine is terrifying...

671
00:52:36,984 --> 00:52:39,053
and simple to understand...

672
00:52:39,153 --> 00:52:42,823
and completely credible
and convincing.

673
00:52:42,923 --> 00:52:46,227
I wish we had one of them
doomsday machines.

674
00:52:46,327 --> 00:52:49,897
But this is fantastic, Strangelove.
How can it be triggered automatically?

675
00:52:49,997 --> 00:52:53,768
It's remarkably simple to do that.

676
00:52:53,868 --> 00:52:57,371
When you merely wish to bury bombs...

677
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,774
there's no limit to the size.

678
00:52:59,874 --> 00:53:02,076
After that, they are connected...

679
00:53:02,176 --> 00:53:06,180
to a gigantic complex of computers.

680
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:11,986
Now then, a specific and clearly
defined set of circumstances...

681
00:53:12,086 --> 00:53:15,523
under which the bombs
are to be exploded...

682
00:53:15,623 --> 00:53:19,627
is programmed into a tape memory bank.

683
00:53:19,727 --> 00:53:22,821
Hmm. Strangelove?

684
00:53:23,898 --> 00:53:26,934
What kind of a name is that?
That ain't no Kraut name, is it?

685
00:53:27,034 --> 00:53:29,303
He changed it when he became a citizen.

686
00:53:29,403 --> 00:53:32,373
It used to be Merkwurdichliebe.

687
00:53:32,473 --> 00:53:36,842
Well, a Kraut by any other name,
uh, Stainsey?

688
00:53:38,746 --> 00:53:43,083
The whole point of
the doomsday machine...

689
00:53:43,183 --> 00:53:46,720
is lost if you keep it a secret!

690
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:48,956
Why didn't you tell the world?

691
00:53:49,056 --> 00:53:53,427
It was to be announced
at the Party Congress on Monday.

692
00:53:53,527 --> 00:53:56,860
As you know,
the premier loves surprises.

693
00:54:45,346 --> 00:54:47,576
Stay with me, Mandrake.

694
00:54:52,753 --> 00:54:55,449
All right, now feed me.
Feed me, boy.

695
00:55:25,319 --> 00:55:30,357
Don't you think we'd be better off
away from this flying glass?

696
00:55:30,457 --> 00:55:32,516
We're okay here.

697
00:55:34,161 --> 00:55:38,165
Mandrake, do you realize that
in addition to fluoridating the water...

698
00:55:38,265 --> 00:55:41,802
there are studies underway
to fluoridate salt, flour...

699
00:55:41,902 --> 00:55:46,907
fruit juices, soup, sugar,
milk, ice cream?

700
00:55:47,007 --> 00:55:48,242
Ice cream.

701
00:55:48,342 --> 00:55:50,744
- Children's ice cream.
- Good Lord.

702
00:55:50,844 --> 00:55:53,278
You know when fluoridation
first began?

703
00:55:54,314 --> 00:55:56,216
No, I don't, Jack.

704
00:55:56,316 --> 00:55:58,752
1946.

705
00:55:58,852 --> 00:56:01,588
1946, Mandrake.

706
00:56:01,688 --> 00:56:05,960
How does that coincide with
your postwar Commie conspiracy, huh?

707
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:09,330
It's incredibly obvious, isn't it?

708
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:14,935
A foreign substance is introduced
into our precious bodily fluids...

709
00:56:15,035 --> 00:56:18,272
without the knowledge
of the individual.

710
00:56:18,372 --> 00:56:20,306
Certainly without any choice.

711
00:56:22,109 --> 00:56:25,408
That's the way a hard-core Commie works.

712
00:56:26,847 --> 00:56:30,050
Jack. Tell me, Jack.

713
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:32,786
When did you first become--

714
00:56:32,886 --> 00:56:35,650
Well, develop this theory?

715
00:56:36,757 --> 00:56:38,959
Well, I--

716
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:42,596
I first became aware of it, Mandrake...

717
00:56:42,696 --> 00:56:44,687
during the physical act of love.

718
00:56:46,467 --> 00:56:50,704
Yes, a profound sense of fatigue...

719
00:56:50,804 --> 00:56:53,340
feeling of emptiness followed.

720
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,206
Luckily I was able to interpret
these feelings correctly.

721
00:56:58,612 --> 00:57:00,239
Loss of essence.

722
00:57:01,882 --> 00:57:05,586
I can assure you it has not recurred,
Mandrake.

723
00:57:05,686 --> 00:57:08,621
Women sense my power...

724
00:57:09,857 --> 00:57:11,984
and they seek the life essence.

725
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:16,563
I do not avoid women, Mandrake.

726
00:57:16,663 --> 00:57:19,533
But I do deny them my essence.

727
00:57:19,633 --> 00:57:22,500
Yes, yes, Jack.

728
00:57:35,149 --> 00:57:37,276
Cease fire!

729
00:57:58,572 --> 00:58:00,240
My boys must have surrendered.

730
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:02,643
There it is.

731
00:58:02,743 --> 00:58:04,545
Jack, listen.

732
00:58:04,645 --> 00:58:07,978
While there's still time, I beg you,
let's recall the Wing and--

733
00:58:10,117 --> 00:58:12,950
Those boys were like my children.

734
00:58:14,521 --> 00:58:16,557
Now they let me down.

735
00:58:16,657 --> 00:58:18,325
No, not a bit.

736
00:58:18,425 --> 00:58:21,195
I'm sure they all gave it
their very best.

737
00:58:21,295 --> 00:58:23,764
I'm equally sure they all died
thinking of you...

738
00:58:23,864 --> 00:58:26,567
every man jack of them, Jack.

739
00:58:26,667 --> 00:58:29,303
Supposing a bit of water
has gone off, eh?

740
00:58:29,403 --> 00:58:31,672
Certainly one can never be too sure
about those things.

741
00:58:31,772 --> 00:58:34,708
But look at me.
Do I look all rancid and clotted?

742
00:58:34,808 --> 00:58:37,578
Look at me, Jack. Look.

743
00:58:37,678 --> 00:58:41,748
And I drink a lot of water.
I'm what you might call a water man.

744
00:58:41,848 --> 00:58:45,185
And I can swear to you, my boy,
swear to you...

745
00:58:45,285 --> 00:58:47,521
that there's nothing wrong
with my bodily fluids.

746
00:58:47,621 --> 00:58:50,090
Not a thing, Jackie.

747
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:52,459
Mandrake, were you ever
a prisoner of war?

748
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:56,196
Well, Jack, the time's running very--

749
00:58:56,296 --> 00:58:59,333
- What?
- Were you ever a prisoner of war?

750
00:58:59,433 --> 00:59:01,502
Yes, I was, as a matter of fact.

751
00:59:01,602 --> 00:59:04,671
Did they torture you?

752
00:59:04,771 --> 00:59:07,774
Yes, they did.
I was tortured by the Japanese.

753
00:59:07,874 --> 00:59:09,510
Not a pretty story.

754
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:11,178
What happened?

755
00:59:11,278 --> 00:59:15,549
I don't know, Jack. It's difficult
to think under these conditions.

756
00:59:15,649 --> 00:59:17,851
Well, what happened was...

757
00:59:17,951 --> 00:59:21,321
they got me on the old
Rangoon-Inchinawa Railway.

758
00:59:21,421 --> 00:59:25,759
I was laying train lines
for the bloody Japanese puff-puffs.

759
00:59:25,859 --> 00:59:29,090
No, I mean, when they tortured you,
did you talk?

760
00:59:30,831 --> 00:59:32,799
No, I--

761
00:59:32,899 --> 00:59:37,137
Well, I don't think they wanted me
to talk, really, or say anything.

762
00:59:37,237 --> 00:59:40,307
It was their way of having
a bit of fun, the swine.

763
00:59:40,407 --> 00:59:43,740
The strange thing is,
they make such bloody good cameras.

764
00:59:45,479 --> 00:59:51,111
Those clowns outside will give me
a good going-over soon for the code.

765
00:59:54,121 --> 00:59:57,488
Yes, you may have quite a point
there, Jack.

766
00:59:58,592 --> 01:00:01,562
I don't know how well
I could stand up under torture.

767
01:00:01,662 --> 01:00:04,898
The answer to that is,
no one ever does.

768
01:00:04,998 --> 01:00:09,102
And my advise to you
is to give me the code now.

769
01:00:09,202 --> 01:00:12,072
If those devils come back
and try any rough stuff...

770
01:00:12,172 --> 01:00:15,409
we'll fight them together
like we did just now on the floor.

771
01:00:15,509 --> 01:00:19,012
You with your gun and me
with a belt of ammo, feeding you.

772
01:00:19,112 --> 01:00:21,882
"Feed me," you said,
and I was feeding you, Jack.

773
01:00:21,982 --> 01:00:24,618
You know, Mandrake...

774
01:00:24,718 --> 01:00:27,949
I happen to believe in
a life after this one...

775
01:00:29,456 --> 01:00:32,892
and I know I'll have to answer
for what I've done.

776
01:00:34,728 --> 01:00:36,163
And I think I can.

777
01:00:36,263 --> 01:00:39,466
Yes, of course you can.
Of course you can. You can.

778
01:00:39,566 --> 01:00:41,969
I'm a religious man myself,
you know.

779
01:00:42,069 --> 01:00:45,906
I believe in all that sort of thing
and I'm hoping, you know, Jack--

780
01:00:46,006 --> 01:00:48,842
You've dropped your gun, Jack.

781
01:00:48,942 --> 01:00:52,512
No, Jack, let me take that for you.

782
01:00:52,612 --> 01:00:56,104
You know what I'm hoping? I'm hoping
you're going to give me the code, boy.

783
01:00:57,884 --> 01:01:00,487
You're going to wash and brush up?
What a good idea.

784
01:01:00,587 --> 01:01:03,156
Always did wonders for a man,
a wash and brush up.

785
01:01:03,256 --> 01:01:05,993
Water on the back of the neck
makes you feel marvelous.

786
01:01:06,093 --> 01:01:08,829
That's what we need: water on
the back of the neck and the code.

787
01:01:08,929 --> 01:01:12,499
Supposing I play a little guessing game
with you, Jack boy?

788
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:15,591
I'll try and guess
what the code is--

789
01:01:32,085 --> 01:01:36,556
Copilot to navigator.
I'm ready with the fuel figures now.

790
01:01:36,656 --> 01:01:39,593
We have 109,000 total...

791
01:01:39,693 --> 01:01:42,496
79,000 in the mains...

792
01:01:42,596 --> 01:01:45,365
and 30,000 in the auxiliaries.

793
01:01:45,465 --> 01:01:47,367
And that works out
to roughly...

794
01:01:47,467 --> 01:01:50,925
seven hours, 15 minutes
endurance from this time.

795
01:01:52,072 --> 01:01:53,473
D.S.O. to Captain.

796
01:01:53,573 --> 01:01:56,667
I have an unidentified
radar blip.

797
01:01:58,078 --> 01:02:00,672
Distance: 60 miles.

798
01:02:01,848 --> 01:02:04,985
Approximate speed:
Mach three.

799
01:02:05,085 --> 01:02:07,019
Looks like
a missile tracking us.

800
01:02:09,956 --> 01:02:11,992
Confirmed:
definite missile track.

801
01:02:12,092 --> 01:02:14,151
Commence evasive action right.

802
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,037
Missile still closing range.

803
01:02:24,137 --> 01:02:28,108
Distance: 50 miles.
Continue evasive action.

804
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:30,911
Lock E.C.M. to target intercept mode.

805
01:02:31,011 --> 01:02:34,614
E.C.M. locked to
target intercept mode.

806
01:02:34,714 --> 01:02:37,117
Missile still tracking
and closing distance.

807
01:02:37,217 --> 01:02:41,210
Range: 40 miles.
Continue evasive action.

808
01:02:44,124 --> 01:02:48,362
Electronic Guidance Scrambler
to blue grid.

809
01:02:48,462 --> 01:02:51,932
Missile still tracking steady
and closing distance.

810
01:02:52,032 --> 01:02:53,966
Range: 30 miles.

811
01:02:56,236 --> 01:03:00,468
Missile still closing true and steady.
Continue evasive action.

812
01:03:08,014 --> 01:03:09,983
Range: 20 miles.

813
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:13,920
Missile still closing distance
and tracking steady.

814
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:16,423
Attack range gate
on maximum scan.

815
01:03:16,523 --> 01:03:18,925
Range gate on maximum scan.

816
01:03:19,025 --> 01:03:21,862
Range: 10 miles.

817
01:03:21,962 --> 01:03:25,899
Missile track deflecting.
Continue evasive action.

818
01:03:25,999 --> 01:03:29,236
Deflection increasing.
Range: eight miles.

819
01:03:29,336 --> 01:03:33,240
Deflection still increasing.
Range: six miles.

820
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:36,036
Missile still deflecting.
Range: four miles.

821
01:03:41,848 --> 01:03:45,018
Range: two miles.
Missile still deflecting.

822
01:03:45,118 --> 01:03:47,382
Range: one mile.
Missile detonated!

823
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:56,153
- Start lever to cut off!
- Cut off!

824
01:03:59,566 --> 01:04:00,999
We're losin' power!

825
01:04:09,442 --> 01:04:11,745
Re-select essential power!

826
01:04:11,845 --> 01:04:13,870
Essential power re-selected.

827
01:04:20,487 --> 01:04:22,421
The hatch is stuck!

828
01:04:25,992 --> 01:04:27,425
Hit emergency power!

829
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:32,763
- Extinguishers!
- Roger!

830
01:04:39,506 --> 01:04:42,742
- Transfer switches!
- Transferred!

831
01:04:42,842 --> 01:04:45,106
- Boost pumps off!
- Cut off!

832
01:04:56,856 --> 01:04:58,847
Fuel valves three, four and six!

833
01:05:11,371 --> 01:05:12,804
Give me full power!

834
01:05:25,685 --> 01:05:28,279
Peace on Earth.

835
01:05:32,926 --> 01:05:35,595
P.O.E.

836
01:05:35,695 --> 01:05:38,532
Purity of Essence.

837
01:05:38,632 --> 01:05:42,159
O.P.O.E.

838
01:05:53,313 --> 01:05:55,615
Put your hands over your head.

839
01:05:55,715 --> 01:05:58,318
What do you think you're doing?
Who are you?

840
01:05:58,418 --> 01:06:00,253
Put your hands over your head.

841
01:06:00,353 --> 01:06:03,924
What kind of suit
do you call that, fella?

842
01:06:04,024 --> 01:06:05,992
What do you mean, suit?

843
01:06:06,092 --> 01:06:08,495
This happens to be
an R.A.F. uniform...

844
01:06:08,595 --> 01:06:12,899
and I am Group Captain Lionel Mandrake,
General Ripper's executive officer.

845
01:06:12,999 --> 01:06:14,501
Where's General Ripper?

846
01:06:14,601 --> 01:06:17,404
He's dead, in the bathroom.

847
01:06:17,504 --> 01:06:19,639
Where's the bathroom?

848
01:06:19,739 --> 01:06:21,172
Next to you.

849
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:33,353
I don't know what stupid game
this is you're playing...

850
01:06:33,453 --> 01:06:35,555
but I've got a good idea
what the recall code is...

851
01:06:35,655 --> 01:06:38,158
and I have to get in touch
with SAC headquarters immediately!

852
01:06:38,258 --> 01:06:41,928
Put your hands over your head
and keep 'em there! Go on.

853
01:06:42,028 --> 01:06:43,697
Got any witnesses?

854
01:06:43,797 --> 01:06:45,699
What are you talking about?
He shot himself!

855
01:06:45,799 --> 01:06:47,801
While he was shavin'?

856
01:06:47,901 --> 01:06:51,037
Now look, Colonel Bat Guano...

857
01:06:51,137 --> 01:06:53,573
if that really is your name...

858
01:06:53,673 --> 01:06:57,510
may I tell you that I have
a very good idea--

859
01:06:57,610 --> 01:07:00,614
I think, hope, pray--
what the recall code is.

860
01:07:00,714 --> 01:07:03,416
It's some theme he kept repeating.
A variation on...

861
01:07:03,516 --> 01:07:06,720
"Peace on Earth" or "Purity of Essence,"
one of those.

862
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:10,624
Put your hands on top of your head.
Start walkin'.

863
01:07:10,724 --> 01:07:13,927
Don't you know that General Ripper
went mad...

864
01:07:14,027 --> 01:07:17,397
and sent the whole Wing
to attack the Soviets?

865
01:07:17,497 --> 01:07:21,001
- What are you talkin' about?
- I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

866
01:07:21,101 --> 01:07:25,171
I'm going to pick up this red telephone,
which is connected to SAC...

867
01:07:25,271 --> 01:07:26,704
and I hope--

868
01:07:28,241 --> 01:07:30,377
Blast. Blast.

869
01:07:30,477 --> 01:07:34,470
Shot away, I expect, by one of your men
during this ridiculous fighting!

870
01:07:35,915 --> 01:07:37,917
Right.

871
01:07:38,017 --> 01:07:41,388
All right, Charlie, I've been
wastin' too much time on you.

872
01:07:41,488 --> 01:07:45,288
I got a lot of wounded men outside.
Start walkin'.

873
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:11,384
All the radio gear is out,
including the C.R.M. 114.

874
01:08:11,484 --> 01:08:14,647
I think the auto-destruct mechanism
got hit and blew itself up.

875
01:08:19,159 --> 01:08:22,362
The fire is out.
The emergency power is on.

876
01:08:22,462 --> 01:08:25,932
Everything checks out all right.
Will advise.

877
01:08:26,032 --> 01:08:27,734
Roger. Navigator?

878
01:08:27,834 --> 01:08:33,273
I've worked out our rate of fuel loss
at approximately 1-6-2 per minute.

879
01:08:33,373 --> 01:08:36,142
This gives us a radius of action
sufficient to take out...

880
01:08:36,242 --> 01:08:39,579
primary and secondary targets,
but we will not...

881
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:43,843
repeat, not be able to make it back
to any base or neutral country.

882
01:08:44,784 --> 01:08:47,320
However, we would have
enough fuel to ditch...

883
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:50,123
at weather ship Tango Delta...

884
01:08:50,223 --> 01:08:53,488
grid coordinates 0-0-3-6-9-1.

885
01:08:58,264 --> 01:09:00,667
Well, boys,
we got three engines out.

886
01:09:00,767 --> 01:09:04,537
We got more holes in us
than a horse trader's mule.

887
01:09:04,637 --> 01:09:06,639
The radio is gone,
and we're leakin' fuel.

888
01:09:06,739 --> 01:09:10,143
And if we was flyin' any lower,
we'd need sleigh bells on this thing.

889
01:09:10,243 --> 01:09:13,213
But we got one little budge
on them Ruskies.

890
01:09:13,313 --> 01:09:15,215
At this height
they might harpoon us...

891
01:09:15,315 --> 01:09:18,409
but they sure ain't gonna spot us
on no radar screen.

892
01:09:29,596 --> 01:09:31,498
The other way.

893
01:09:31,598 --> 01:09:33,998
- Where are you taking me?
- To the main gate.

894
01:09:36,069 --> 01:09:39,506
Colonel, I must know what you think
has been going on here.

895
01:09:39,606 --> 01:09:41,508
- You wanna know what I think?
- Yes.

896
01:09:41,608 --> 01:09:44,277
I think you're some kind
of deviated "prevert."

897
01:09:44,377 --> 01:09:47,080
I think General Ripper found out
about your "preversion"...

898
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:49,449
and that you were organizing
some kind of mutiny of "preverts."

899
01:09:49,549 --> 01:09:51,918
Now, move!

900
01:09:52,018 --> 01:09:55,321
On top of that, I don't know anything
about any planes attacking Russia.

901
01:09:55,421 --> 01:09:59,192
I was told to get Ripper on the phone
with the President of the United States.

902
01:09:59,292 --> 01:10:04,030
Now just one second.
You just said "the president."

903
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:06,332
What about the president?

904
01:10:06,432 --> 01:10:09,569
The president wants to speak
to General Ripper, doesn't he?

905
01:10:09,669 --> 01:10:12,238
Now, General Ripper is dead,
is he not?

906
01:10:12,338 --> 01:10:14,541
I am General Ripper's
executive officer...

907
01:10:14,641 --> 01:10:17,577
so the president will want
to speak to me, won't he?

908
01:10:17,677 --> 01:10:21,381
There's a telephone box over there
and the line may be open.

909
01:10:21,481 --> 01:10:24,250
You wanna talk to
the President of the United States?

910
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:27,187
I don't want to talk to him, Colonel,
I've got to talk to him.

911
01:10:27,287 --> 01:10:30,924
And if you don't put that gun away
and stop this stupid nonsense...

912
01:10:31,024 --> 01:10:35,028
the Court of Inquiry on this
will give you such a pranging...

913
01:10:35,128 --> 01:10:39,224
you'll be lucky to end up wearing the
uniform of a bloody toilet attendant!

914
01:10:44,037 --> 01:10:47,666
Go ahead, try and get the President
of the United States on the phone.

915
01:10:50,343 --> 01:10:52,402
Try any "preversions,"
I'll blow your head off.

916
01:11:07,026 --> 01:11:09,829
Operator? This is
Group Captain Lionel Mandrake.

917
01:11:09,929 --> 01:11:11,965
I'm speaking from
Burpelson Air Force Base.

918
01:11:12,065 --> 01:11:15,935
Something urgent has come up and I want
you to place a person-to-person call...

919
01:11:16,035 --> 01:11:19,129
with President Merkin Muffley
in the Pentagon, Washington, D.C.

920
01:11:20,506 --> 01:11:23,703
Burpelson 3-9-1-8-0.

921
01:11:24,911 --> 01:11:29,949
No, I'm perfectly serious.
The President of the United States.

922
01:11:30,049 --> 01:11:32,919
I'm sorry,
I haven't got enough change.

923
01:11:33,019 --> 01:11:36,455
Could you make this
a collect call, Operator?

924
01:11:48,401 --> 01:11:52,005
Just one second, Operator.
They won't accept the call.

925
01:11:52,105 --> 01:11:53,973
Have you got 55 cents?

926
01:11:54,073 --> 01:11:57,099
Do you think I'd go into combat
with loose change in my pocket?

927
01:11:59,479 --> 01:12:02,348
Operator, look.

928
01:12:02,448 --> 01:12:05,919
Is it possible to make this
an ordinary trunk call?

929
01:12:06,019 --> 01:12:08,755
Well, what do you call it?
You know--

930
01:12:08,855 --> 01:12:11,847
Oh, station-to-station.

931
01:12:15,962 --> 01:12:19,454
Oh, blast!
I'm still 20 cents short.

932
01:12:21,334 --> 01:12:24,737
Operator, hold on.
I shan't keep you a second.

933
01:12:24,837 --> 01:12:28,975
Colonel, that Coca-Cola machine.
I want you to shoot the lock off it.

934
01:12:29,075 --> 01:12:31,134
There may be change in there.

935
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,115
That's private property.

936
01:12:36,215 --> 01:12:39,118
Can you possibly imagine
what is going to happen to you...

937
01:12:39,218 --> 01:12:41,888
your frame outlook,
way of life and everything...

938
01:12:41,988 --> 01:12:46,492
when they learn you have obstructed
a phone call to the president?

939
01:12:46,592 --> 01:12:50,563
Can you imagine?
Shoot it off!

940
01:12:50,663 --> 01:12:54,267
Shoot with the gun! That's what
the bullets are for, you twit!

941
01:12:54,367 --> 01:12:57,804
Okay, I'm gonna get
your money for you.

942
01:12:57,904 --> 01:13:02,008
But if you don't get the president on
the phone, you know what's gonna happen?

943
01:13:02,108 --> 01:13:05,703
You're gonna have to answer
to the Coca-Cola Company.

944
01:13:15,021 --> 01:13:17,924
This is SAC
Communications Control.

945
01:13:18,024 --> 01:13:21,394
The recall code O.P.E...

946
01:13:21,494 --> 01:13:23,396
is being acknowledged "roger"...

947
01:13:23,496 --> 01:13:28,368
by elements of
the 8-4-3 Bomb Wing.

948
01:13:28,468 --> 01:13:30,436
These are the details.

949
01:13:30,536 --> 01:13:35,074
Missions 12, 22, 30 and 38...

950
01:13:35,174 --> 01:13:38,711
are reported destroyed
by enemy action.

951
01:13:38,811 --> 01:13:43,383
All other missions have
acknowledged recall code.

952
01:13:43,483 --> 01:13:45,385
This is SAC Communications Control.

953
01:13:45,485 --> 01:13:47,120
Over and out.

954
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:49,088
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

955
01:13:49,188 --> 01:13:51,557
Gentlemen.

956
01:13:51,657 --> 01:13:53,559
Mr.President.

957
01:13:53,659 --> 01:13:55,728
I'm not a sentimentalist by nature...

958
01:13:55,828 --> 01:13:59,065
but I think I know what's
in every heart in this room.

959
01:13:59,165 --> 01:14:02,969
I think we all ought
to bow our heads...

960
01:14:03,069 --> 01:14:05,104
and give a prayer of thanks
for our deliverance.

961
01:14:05,204 --> 01:14:06,637
Lord...

962
01:14:07,874 --> 01:14:12,445
we have heard the wings
of the Angel of Death...

963
01:14:12,545 --> 01:14:15,381
fluttering over our heads
from the Valley of Fear.

964
01:14:15,481 --> 01:14:18,117
You have seen fit to deliver us
from the forces of evil--

965
01:14:18,217 --> 01:14:19,786
Excuse me, sir.

966
01:14:19,886 --> 01:14:23,014
Premier Kissoff's calling again
and he's hopping mad.

967
01:14:29,762 --> 01:14:33,666
Fuel flow on active engines
and leakage has increased.

968
01:14:33,766 --> 01:14:37,793
Now works out at 2-0-5.

969
01:14:38,871 --> 01:14:40,840
Estimate remaining fuel...

970
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:44,842
at 8-7-9-0.

971
01:14:48,181 --> 01:14:52,018
Roger.
Confirm 2-0-5 per minute...

972
01:14:52,118 --> 01:14:56,179
and remaining fuel 8-7-9-0.

973
01:15:02,695 --> 01:15:06,766
No, no, Dimitri,
there must be some mistake.

974
01:15:06,866 --> 01:15:08,901
No, I'm certain of that.

975
01:15:09,001 --> 01:15:13,172
I'm perfectly certain
of that, Dimitri.

976
01:15:13,272 --> 01:15:16,142
Just a second.
You know what he says?

977
01:15:16,242 --> 01:15:18,478
He says one of the planes
hasn't turned back.

978
01:15:18,578 --> 01:15:21,147
He says according to information
forwarded by our Air Staffs...

979
01:15:21,247 --> 01:15:24,182
it's headed for
the missile complex at Laputa.

980
01:15:27,186 --> 01:15:30,089
That's impossible, Mr.President.

981
01:15:30,189 --> 01:15:32,225
I mean,
look at the big board.

982
01:15:32,325 --> 01:15:35,428
Thirty-four planes, 30 recalls
acknowledged and four splashes...

983
01:15:35,528 --> 01:15:38,395
and one of them
was targeted for Laputa.

984
01:15:41,334 --> 01:15:44,504
Dimitri, look, we've got
an acknowledgement from every plane...

985
01:15:44,604 --> 01:15:47,869
except the four you've shot down.

986
01:15:55,214 --> 01:15:57,583
Hang on a second, Dimitri.

987
01:15:57,683 --> 01:16:00,987
He says their air defense now only
claims three aircraft confirmed.

988
01:16:01,087 --> 01:16:03,555
The fourth may only be damaged.

989
01:16:05,725 --> 01:16:07,627
Mr.President...

990
01:16:07,727 --> 01:16:10,062
I'm beginnin' to smell
a big, fat Commie rat.

991
01:16:10,162 --> 01:16:14,000
I mean, supposin' Kissoff is lyin'
about that fourth plane...

992
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,235
just lookin' for
an excuse to clobber us?

993
01:16:16,335 --> 01:16:18,769
If the spaghetti hits the fan,
we're in trouble.

994
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:25,444
Dimitri, look,
if this report is true...

995
01:16:25,544 --> 01:16:29,148
and the plane manages
to bomb the target...

996
01:16:29,248 --> 01:16:33,480
is this gonna set off
the doomsday machine?

997
01:16:36,722 --> 01:16:38,690
Are you sure?

998
01:16:39,892 --> 01:16:44,430
Well, I guess you're just gonna have
to get that plane, Dimitri.

999
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:47,567
I'm sorry they're jamming
your radar and flying so low...

1000
01:16:47,667 --> 01:16:49,835
but they're trained to do it.

1001
01:16:49,935 --> 01:16:51,596
It's initiative.

1002
01:16:53,306 --> 01:16:56,142
Look, Dimitri, you know
exactly where they're going...

1003
01:16:56,242 --> 01:16:59,405
and I'm sure your entire air defense
can stop a single plane.

1004
01:17:02,581 --> 01:17:07,177
It's not gonna help either one of us
if the doomsday machine goes off, is it?

1005
01:17:08,721 --> 01:17:13,960
There's no point in you getting
hysterical at a moment like this!

1006
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:18,264
Keep your feet on the ground
when you're talking, Dimitri.

1007
01:17:18,364 --> 01:17:20,600
I am not--
I am not getting--

1008
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:23,102
No, Dimitri, I'm just worried.

1009
01:17:23,202 --> 01:17:25,071
That's all.

1010
01:17:25,171 --> 01:17:28,207
Now look, if our Air Staffs say
its primary target is Laputa...

1011
01:17:28,307 --> 01:17:32,245
and its secondary target is Borchov,
it's true.

1012
01:17:32,345 --> 01:17:33,746
You gotta believe it!

1013
01:17:33,846 --> 01:17:37,550
Dimitri, can I give you
just one word--

1014
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:40,953
Can I give you just one word
of advice, Dimitri?

1015
01:17:41,053 --> 01:17:42,688
Listen, Dimitri.

1016
01:17:42,788 --> 01:17:46,349
Put everything you've got into
those two sectors, and you can't miss!

1017
01:17:52,732 --> 01:17:56,369
Sir, if we continue to lose fuel
at the present rate...

1018
01:17:56,469 --> 01:18:00,573
I estimate we only have
38 minutes flying time...

1019
01:18:00,673 --> 01:18:03,109
which will not even take us
as far as the primary.

1020
01:18:03,209 --> 01:18:07,113
Doggone it, Sweets, you told me that
you could get me to the primary!

1021
01:18:07,213 --> 01:18:11,017
I'm sorry, sir. That estimate was based
on the original loss rate factor...

1022
01:18:11,117 --> 01:18:12,885
not at 2-0-5.

1023
01:18:12,985 --> 01:18:15,221
I don't give a hoot in hell
how you do it...

1024
01:18:15,321 --> 01:18:17,456
you just get me to
the primary, you hear?

1025
01:18:17,556 --> 01:18:20,960
I'm sorry, sir,
but those are the figures.

1026
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:24,297
We'll be lucky to reach
weather ship at Tango Delta.

1027
01:18:24,397 --> 01:18:26,565
Well, shoot!

1028
01:18:26,665 --> 01:18:30,970
We ain't come this far just
to dump this thing in the drink.

1029
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:33,061
What's the nearest
target of opportunity?

1030
01:18:41,847 --> 01:18:44,550
Sir, if the rate of loss
does not increase...

1031
01:18:44,650 --> 01:18:48,387
we have a chance
to reach target 3-8-4...

1032
01:18:48,487 --> 01:18:53,292
grid coordinate 0-0-3-6-9-1...

1033
01:18:53,392 --> 01:18:57,229
and possibly make it from there
to the Tango Delta weather ship.

1034
01:18:57,329 --> 01:18:59,432
What kind of a target
is that, anyhow?

1035
01:18:59,532 --> 01:19:03,436
Sir, that's the I.C.B.M.
complex at Kotloss.

1036
01:19:03,536 --> 01:19:09,241
All right.
Designating new target: 3-8-4.

1037
01:19:09,341 --> 01:19:12,333
Give me a headin' on that just as soon
as you get it worked out.

1038
01:19:24,523 --> 01:19:29,362
We'll keep our fingers crossed.
Remember, we're all in this together.

1039
01:19:29,462 --> 01:19:33,265
We're right behind you,
we're with you all the way.

1040
01:19:33,365 --> 01:19:37,069
Yes. We'll keep the line open.

1041
01:19:37,169 --> 01:19:38,602
All right, Dimitri.

1042
01:19:40,973 --> 01:19:42,375
General Turgidson...

1043
01:19:42,475 --> 01:19:45,706
is there really a chance
for that plane to get through?

1044
01:19:47,413 --> 01:19:49,815
Mr.President,
if I may speak freely.

1045
01:19:49,915 --> 01:19:53,519
The Ruskie talks big, but frankly
we think he's short of know-how.

1046
01:19:53,619 --> 01:19:58,090
You can't expect ignorant peons
to understand a machine like our boys.

1047
01:19:58,190 --> 01:20:00,593
That's not meant as an insult,
Mr.Ambassador.

1048
01:20:00,693 --> 01:20:03,262
We all know how much guts
the average Ruskie's got.

1049
01:20:03,362 --> 01:20:06,465
Look at all of them Nazis killed
off, and they still wouldn't quit!

1050
01:20:06,565 --> 01:20:08,434
Can't you stick to the point?

1051
01:20:08,534 --> 01:20:12,238
Well, sir,
if the pilot's good, see--

1052
01:20:12,338 --> 01:20:16,475
I mean, if he's really sharp,
he can barrel that baby in so low.

1053
01:20:16,575 --> 01:20:21,046
You oughta see it! It's a sight!
A big plane like a 52! Vroom!

1054
01:20:21,146 --> 01:20:24,183
Its jet exhaust fryin' chickens
in the barnyard!

1055
01:20:24,283 --> 01:20:27,386
- But has he got a chance?
- Has he got a chance?

1056
01:20:27,486 --> 01:20:28,919
Hell, ye--

1057
01:20:54,413 --> 01:20:55,815
Navigator to Captain.

1058
01:20:55,915 --> 01:21:00,419
Approaching target
at distance 1-0 miles.

1059
01:21:00,519 --> 01:21:03,823
Switch from green grid
to target orange.

1060
01:21:03,923 --> 01:21:06,992
Roger.
Ready for final bomb run check.

1061
01:21:07,092 --> 01:21:08,525
- Take over, Ace.
- Roger.

1062
01:21:13,799 --> 01:21:16,268
- D.S.O. ready.
- Bombardier ready, sir.

1063
01:21:16,368 --> 01:21:18,537
Bomb fusing, master safety on.

1064
01:21:18,637 --> 01:21:21,707
Electronic, barometric,
time and impact.

1065
01:21:21,807 --> 01:21:24,109
Bomb fusing,
master safeties on.

1066
01:21:24,209 --> 01:21:27,246
Electronic, barometric,
time and impact.

1067
01:21:27,346 --> 01:21:30,916
Fuse for ground burst.

01:22:09,355 --> 01:22:11,289

1083
01:22:22,234 --> 01:22:23,667
Second safety.

1084
01:22:31,210 --> 01:22:33,872

1085
01:22:44,456 --> 01:22:47,893

1090
01:22:59,238 --> 01:23:01,540

1098
01:23:53,926 --> 01:23:57,862
Stay on the bomb run, Ace. I'm goin'
down below and see what I can do.

1099
01:24:10,809 --> 01:24:12,244
Stay on the bomb run.

1100
01:24:12,344 --> 01:24:16,542
I'm gonna get them doors open
if it harelips everybody on Bear Creek!

1101
01:25:10,102 --> 01:25:12,971
Target orange grid reference checks.

1102
01:25:13,071 --> 01:25:15,340

1117
01:26:17,502 --> 01:26:19,171
Roger. Four miles.

1118
01:26:19,271 --> 01:26:22,141
Auto C.D.C. into

1119
01:26:22,241 --> 01:26:24,835

1120
01:26:35,087 --> 01:26:37,589
Target distance: three miles.

1121
01:26:37,689 --> 01:26:40,159
Roger. Three miles.

1122
01:26:40,259 --> 01:26:43,922
Target in sight!
Where in hell is Major Kong?

1123
01:27:07,686 --> 01:27:08,948
What about Major Kong?

1124
01:27:37,149 --> 01:27:40,819
Mr.President, I would not
rule out the chance...

1125
01:27:40,919 --> 01:27:43,956
to preserve a nucleus
of human specimens.

1126
01:27:44,056 --> 01:27:46,957
It would be quite easy...

1127
01:27:49,361 --> 01:27:54,433
at the bottom of some
of our deeper mine shafts.

1128
01:27:54,533 --> 01:27:59,338
The radioactivity would never penetrate
a mine some thousands of feet deep.

1129
01:27:59,438 --> 01:28:03,675
And in a matter of weeks, sufficient
improvements in dwelling space...

1130
01:28:03,775 --> 01:28:05,677
could easily be provided.

1131
01:28:05,777 --> 01:28:08,513
How long would you have
to stay down there?

1132
01:28:08,613 --> 01:28:12,451
Well, that's, you know--

1133
01:28:12,551 --> 01:28:15,213
Cobalt thorium G.

1134
01:28:25,464 --> 01:28:29,298
Radioactive half-life of--

1135
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:36,103
I would think that possibly
one hundred years.

1136
01:28:38,443 --> 01:28:42,414
You mean, people could actually
stay down there for 100 years?

1137
01:28:42,514 --> 01:28:44,716
It would not be difficult,
Mein Fuhrer.

1138
01:28:44,816 --> 01:28:47,019
Nuclear reactors could--

1139
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:49,454
I'm sorry, Mr.President.

1140
01:28:49,554 --> 01:28:53,325
Nuclear reactors could provide
power almost indefinitely.

1141
01:28:53,425 --> 01:28:56,228
Greenhouses could maintain
plant life.

1142
01:28:56,328 --> 01:28:59,898
Animals could be bred
and slaughtered.

1143
01:28:59,998 --> 01:29:04,403
A quick survey would have to be made of
the available mine sites in the country.

1144
01:29:04,503 --> 01:29:08,273
But I would guess
that a dwelling space...

1145
01:29:08,373 --> 01:29:12,010
for several hundred thousand of
our people could easily be provided.

1146
01:29:12,110 --> 01:29:15,213
Well, I would hate
to have to decide...

1147
01:29:15,313 --> 01:29:18,183
who stays up and who goes down.

1148
01:29:18,283 --> 01:29:22,154
Well, that would not be
necessary, Mr.President.

1149
01:29:22,254 --> 01:29:25,090
It could easily be accomplished
with a computer.

1150
01:29:25,190 --> 01:29:27,459
And the computer could
be set and programmed...

1151
01:29:27,559 --> 01:29:30,595
to accept factors
from youth, health...

1152
01:29:30,695 --> 01:29:33,832
sexual fertility, intelligence...

1153
01:29:33,932 --> 01:29:36,401
and a cross-section
of necessary skills.

1154
01:29:36,501 --> 01:29:38,737
Of course, it would be
absolutely vital...

1155
01:29:38,837 --> 01:29:42,774
that our top government
and military men be included...

1156
01:29:42,874 --> 01:29:47,709
to foster and impart the required
principles of leadership and tradition.

1157
01:29:53,752 --> 01:29:56,655
Naturally, they would breed
prodigiously.

1158
01:29:56,755 --> 01:29:59,553
There would be much time
and little to do.

1159
01:30:01,159 --> 01:30:06,064
But with the proper breeding techniques
and a ratio of, say...

1160
01:30:06,164 --> 01:30:08,900
ten females to each male...

1161
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:13,605
they could then work their way back
to the present gross national product...

1162
01:30:13,705 --> 01:30:15,468
within 20 years.

1163
01:30:16,675 --> 01:30:19,378
But look, Doctor.
Wouldn't this nucleus of survivors...

1164
01:30:19,478 --> 01:30:24,549
be so grief-stricken
and anguished that they...

1165
01:30:24,649 --> 01:30:28,120
well, envy the dead
and not want to go on living?

1166
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:31,053
No, sir. Excuse me.

1167
01:30:40,332 --> 01:30:44,236
When they go down into the mine,
everyone would still be alive.

1168
01:30:44,336 --> 01:30:46,405
There would be
no shocking memories...

1169
01:30:46,505 --> 01:30:51,143
and the prevailing emotion will be one
of nostalgia for those left behind...

1170
01:30:51,243 --> 01:30:54,079
combined with a spirt of...

1171
01:30:54,179 --> 01:30:56,613
bold curiosity for
the adventure ahead!

1172
01:31:14,132 --> 01:31:16,066
Doctor...

1173
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:23,675
you mentioned the ratio
of ten women to each man.

1174
01:31:23,775 --> 01:31:26,878
Now, wouldn't that
necessitate the abandonment...

1175
01:31:26,978 --> 01:31:30,749
of the so-called
monogamous sexual relationship?

1176
01:31:30,849 --> 01:31:34,453
I mean, as far as men were concerned?

1177
01:31:34,553 --> 01:31:35,887
Regrettably, yes.

1178
01:31:35,987 --> 01:31:41,326
But it is a sacrifice required
for the future of the human race.

1179
01:31:41,426 --> 01:31:46,420
I hasten to add that since each man
will be required to do prodigious...

1180
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:50,102
service along these lines...

1181
01:31:50,202 --> 01:31:53,972
the women will have to be selected
for their sexual characteristics...

1182
01:31:54,072 --> 01:31:57,809
which will have to be of
a highly stimulating nature.

1183
01:31:57,909 --> 01:32:01,743
I must confess, you have an
astonishingly good idea there, Doctor.

1184
01:32:02,914 --> 01:32:04,316
Thank you, sir.

1185
01:32:04,416 --> 01:32:07,352
We ought to look at this
from the military point of view.

1186
01:32:07,452 --> 01:32:11,356
I mean,
supposing the Ruskies...

1187
01:32:11,456 --> 01:32:14,359
stashed away some big bombs,
see, and we didn't?

1188
01:32:14,459 --> 01:32:17,329
When they come out in 100 years,
they could take over!

1189
01:32:17,429 --> 01:32:19,164
I agree, Mr.President.

1190
01:32:19,264 --> 01:32:22,834
They might try a sneak attack so they
could take over our mine shaft space.

1191
01:32:22,934 --> 01:32:27,539
It'd be extremely naive of us to
imagine that these new developments...

1192
01:32:27,639 --> 01:32:30,542
are gonna cause any change
in Soviet expansionist policy!

1193
01:32:30,642 --> 01:32:33,445
I mean, we must be
increasingly on the alert...

1194
01:32:33,545 --> 01:32:36,047
to prevent them from taking over
other mine shaft space...

1195
01:32:36,147 --> 01:32:38,049
in order to breed more
prodigiously than we do...

1196
01:32:38,149 --> 01:32:41,253
thus knocking us out through
superior numbers when we emerge!

1197
01:32:41,353 --> 01:32:45,423
Mr.President, we must not allow
a mine-shaft gap!

1198
01:32:45,523 --> 01:32:47,592
Sir!

1199
01:32:47,692 --> 01:32:49,956
I have a plan--

1200
01:32:51,496 --> 01:32:53,798
Mein Fuhrer...

1201
01:32:53,898 --> 01:32:56,492
I can walk!
