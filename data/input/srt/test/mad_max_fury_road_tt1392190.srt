1
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,814
<i>My name is Max.</i>

2
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,279
<i>My world is fire and blood.</i>

3
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,711
<i>Why are you hurting
these people?</i>

4
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,288
<i>It's the oil, stupid.</i>

5
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,999
<i>- Oil wars.
- We are killing for guzzoline.</i>

6
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,921
<i>The world is running
out of water.</i>

7
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,911
<i>Now there's the water wars.</i>

8
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,999
<i>Once, I was a cop.</i>

9
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:42,798
<i>A road warrior searching
for a righteous cause.</i>

10
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,643
<i>To the terminal freak-out point.</i>

11
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,973
<i>Mankind has gone rogue,
terrorizing itself.</i>

12
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,558
<i>Thermonuclear skirmish.</i>

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,972
<i>The earth is sour.</i>

14
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,470
<i>Our bones are poisoned.</i>

15
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,687
<i>We have become half-life.</i>

16
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,565
<i>As the world fell...</i>

17
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,732
<i>each of us, in our
own way, was broken.</i>

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,444
<i>It was hard to know
who was more crazy:</i>

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,617
<i>Me...</i>

20
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,737
<i>or everyone else.</i>

21
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,578
<i>Hello?</i>

22
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,627
<i>Where are you?</i>

23
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,169
<i>Where are you, Max?</i>

24
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,388
<i>- Here they come again.
- Max Rockatansky.</i>

25
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,804
<i>Worming their way into the
black matter of my brain.</i>

26
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,052
<i>- Help us, Max.
- You promised to help us.</i>

27
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,225
<i>I tell myself...</i>

28
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,569
<i>they cannot touch me.</i>

29
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,236
<i>They are long dead.</i>

30
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,169
<i>I am the one...</i>

31
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,510
<i>who runs from both the
living and the dead.</i>

32
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,926
<i>Hunted by scavengers.</i>

33
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:55,475
<i>Haunted by those I
could not protect.</i>

34
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,354
<i>So I exist in this wasteland.</i>

35
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:16,406
<i>A man reduced to a
single instinct:</i>

36
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,577
<i>Survive.</i>

37
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,070
Max?

38
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,113
Is that you?

39
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,157
Where were you?

40
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,083
Help us. Where were you?

41
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,329
Where were you, Max?

42
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,097
Where were you, Max?

43
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:07,723
Stop running.

44
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,522
You let us die!

45
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,438
You let us die!

46
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,904
You let us die!

47
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:15,695
You promised to help us!

48
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:16,941
Why?

49
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,171
Witness!

50
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,594
I got him.

51
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,813
We are War Boys!

52
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,058
War Boys!

53
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,069
Kamakrazee War Boys!

54
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,312
War Boys!

55
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,482
Fucacima kamakrazee...

56
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,029
War Boys!

57
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,243
Hooked on!

58
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,028
Today we're heading...

59
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,497
to Gas Town!

60
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,082
Gas Town!

61
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,326
Today we're hauling Aqua Cola.

62
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,370
Aqua Cola!

63
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,414
- Today we're hauling produce!
- Produce!

64
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,111
And today we're hauling...

65
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,550
Mother's Milk!

66
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,294
Mother's Milk!

67
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:27,497
<i>Joe! Joe! Joe! Immortan Joe!</i>

68
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,395
Rev it up for the Immortan Joe!

69
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:03,651
Once again, we send off my
War Rig to bring back...

70
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,244
guzzoline from Gas Town...

71
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,239
and bullets from
the Bullet Farm!

72
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:13,456
Once again, I salute
my Imperator...

73
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,329
Furiosa!

74
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,578
And I salute...

75
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,374
my half-life War Boys...

76
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,968
who will ride with me eternal...

77
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,596
on the highways of Valhalla.

78
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,216
<i>V8! V8! V8! V8!</i>

79
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,093
I am your redeemer.

80
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,687
It is by my hand...

81
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,978
you will rise from the ashes...

82
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,224
of this world!

83
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,820
It's coming. Get ready.

84
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:52,040
Yes. Yes. Yes. It's coming.

85
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,719
Do not, my friends...

86
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,093
become addicted to water.

87
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,936
It will take hold of you...

88
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,140
and you will resent its absence.

89
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,507
Clear off!

90
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,090
Get them all off!

91
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,629
Clear off!

92
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,677
Get them all off.

93
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,763
Get off!

94
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,192
Signal Gas Town.
Convoy's on its way.

95
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,377
I got a War Boy...

96
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,379
running on empty.

97
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,681
Hook up that full-life.

98
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,934
Hey! Careful. That's
a universal donor.

99
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,539
Boss, we're not
going to Gas Town?

100
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,459
Bullet Farm?

101
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,501
We're heading east.

102
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,251
I'll pass it down the line.

103
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,382
New orders!

104
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,301
Thunder up! Thunder up!

105
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,010
This is not a supply run!

106
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,007
Go. Go.

107
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,766
- Ace, what's going on?
- Go. We're heading east.

108
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,389
- Why?
- I don't know. That's the order.

109
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,033
Moo.

110
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,330
- Hey, Pa.
- Hmm?

111
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,122
You know about this?

112
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,547
Your produce ain't
going to Gas Town.

113
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,016
She's gone off-road...

114
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,303
into hostile territory.

115
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,631
Why would she do that?

116
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,476
Let me see.

117
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:30,443
Rictus.

118
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,153
- I wanna see.
- Rictus.

119
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,648
Go see what's agitating Dad.

120
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,226
Splendid!

121
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,104
Angharad!

122
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:17,606
Where are they?

123
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,658
They are not your property.

124
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:20,901
Miss Giddy?

125
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,703
You cannot own a human being.

126
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,161
Sooner or later
someone pushes back!

127
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,501
Where is she taking them?

128
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,962
She didn't take them.
They begged her to go!

129
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,507
Where is she taking them?

130
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,547
A long way from you.

131
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:04,029
Hey. Hey, what's happening?

132
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,327
Slit!

133
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,492
What's going on? Slit!

134
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,461
Treason. Betrayal. An
Imperator gone rogue.

135
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,374
An Imperator.

136
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,213
Who?

137
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,299
Furiosa! She took a lot of
stuff from Immortan Joe.

138
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,542
What stuff?

139
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,758
Breeders! His prize breeders!

140
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,506
He wants them back! Not
a hand laid on them.

141
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,398
By my deeds I honor him.

142
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,732
V8.

143
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,313
<i>V8! V8! V8!</i>

144
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,487
That's my wheel.

145
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,737
I'm driving.

146
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,780
You're my lancer.

147
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,367
I just promoted myself.

148
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,160
Not today. Today is my day.

149
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,410
Look at you.

150
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,296
If you can't stand up,
you can't do war.

151
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,790
He's right, son.

152
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,212
I'm not staying here dying soft.

153
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,968
You're already a corpse.

154
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,383
- I just need a top-up. More juice.
- No time!

155
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,177
We take my Blood Bag.

156
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,663
We take my Blood Bag and strap
him to the lancer's perch.

157
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,431
It's got a muzzle on it.
It's feral.

158
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,269
That's right.

159
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,730
High-octane crazy
blood filling me up.

160
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,810
If I'm gonna die...

161
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,106
I'm gonna die historic
on the Fury Road.

162
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,536
Yeah. Yeah.

163
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:34,035
- Organic, hitch up his Blood Bag.
- Eh?

164
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,499
Right-o.

165
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,178
How much more can
they take from me?

166
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,642
They've got my blood.
Now it's my car!

167
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,714
Immortan!

168
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,593
Immortan Joe!

169
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:35,934
He looked at me!

170
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,435
- He looked right at me!
- He looked at your Blood Bag!

171
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,982
He turned his head. He
looked me in the eye.

172
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,401
He was scanning the horizon.

173
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:45,906
No.

174
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,324
I am awaited.

175
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,952
I am awaited in Valhalla!

176
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,540
<i>Confucamus!</i>

177
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:57,998
Immortan!

178
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,872
Yeah!

179
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,022
Hey! Heads up!

180
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,268
Heads up!

181
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,108
Boss!

182
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,387
We got vehicles
from the Citadel.

183
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,612
They're firing flares.

184
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,363
They want reinforcements
from Gas Town...

185
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,207
and the Bullet Farm.

186
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,200
What is this?

187
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,793
Backup? Decoy?

188
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,708
It's a detour.

189
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:14,862
Eyes right!

190
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,291
Buzzards!

191
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,457
- Buzzards right! Eyes on! Eyes on!
- Buzzards right!

192
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,795
- Eyes on!
- Eyes on!

193
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,635
Should we turn it around and
run them into our backup?

194
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,842
No! We're good!

195
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,050
We fang it!

196
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,517
Thunder up! Here we go!

197
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,439
Prepare the gunners!

198
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
Morsov!

199
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,051
Come on, attack!

200
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:33,898
War!

201
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,705
Ready!

202
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,375
She's ours, Slit!

203
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,248
She's ours.

204
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,921
First, we get the
Buzzards off her back!

205
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,006
Form up!

206
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,186
That's my head!

207
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,554
Get up! You can do it!

208
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:28,813
Morsov!

209
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,360
- Morsov!
- No!

210
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,319
- Witness me!
- Witness!

211
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:35,562
Witness!

212
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:36,855
Aah!

213
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,077
Fly!

214
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:47,374
Witness!

215
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,616
Witness!

216
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,996
Mediocre, Morsov!

217
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,465
- Mediocre!
- Hoorah!

218
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:17,979
Aah!

219
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,154
Get ready!

220
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:28,866
Back me in!

221
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,254
They're coming!

222
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,974
We can't breathe down there!

223
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,224
Stay out of sight!

224
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:56,811
Now!

225
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,444
Aah!

226
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,491
Go back!

227
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:12,417
Where's he going?

228
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,252
Hydraulics!

229
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:14,494
Hydraulics!

230
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:19,332
Aah!

231
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:37,810
Yeah.

232
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,159
Now we bring home the booty.

233
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,683
She thinks she can lose us, Dad.

234
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,772
She thinks we're stupid.

235
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,393
She thinks she can
lose us in there!

236
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:38,161
Fang it!

237
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,043
Fang it!

238
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,129
Why can't you stop?

239
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,136
Crew! Out of the way!

240
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,099
Out of the way!

241
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,558
What have you done?

242
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,927
What have you done?

243
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:58,806
Yeah.

244
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,235
We need counterweight. Get
the Blood Bag down the back.

245
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:31,515
Hunt them down! Hunt them down!

246
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,449
Hey, head!

247
00:26:58,575 --> 00:26:59,747
Say bye-bye to the neck!

248
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,203
We're going in!

249
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,360
Come on! We've almost got her!

250
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,492
Come on! Hold it steady!

251
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:46,312
Oh, what a day!

252
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,310
What a lovely day!

253
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:08,955
I am the man...

254
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,132
who grabs the sun...

255
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,679
riding to Valhalla!

256
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,140
Witness me...

257
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:20,383
Blood Bag!

258
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,851
Witness!

259
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,003
I live, I die, I live again!

260
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,589
Aah!

261
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,477
We're not going back.

262
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:06,335
Water.

263
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,014
Ah.

264
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,183
You.

265
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,710
Angharad, is that
just the wind...

266
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,121
or is that a furious vexation?

267
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:26,685
Ugh!

268
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,053
I got it!

269
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,690
Aah!

270
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:38,432
Glory me, Blood Bag!
We snagged her alive.

271
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,017
He's gonna shred her. Shred her.

272
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,602
Bolt cutters.

273
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,270
Chain.

274
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,098
Hey, hey!

275
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,403
Oh, look at them.

276
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,232
So shiny. So chrome.

277
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,942
He's gonna be so grateful.

278
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,406
We could ask for anything.

279
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,239
I wanna drive the War Rig.

280
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,458
- What are you gonna ask for?
- That's my jacket.

281
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,418
Heh, heh. Sure.

282
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:11,251
- You can ask for more than a jacket.
- We're going to the Green Place.

283
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:13,216
Wait, it's you and me. Ugh!

284
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,315
We're going to the Green
Place of Many Mothers.

285
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,460
How does it feel?

286
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,875
- It hurts.
- Out here, everything hurts.

287
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,505
You wanna get through this?

288
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:01,214
Do as I say.

289
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,471
Now pick up what
you can and run.

290
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,271
Tsa!

291
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,477
Kill switches.

292
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,651
I set the sequence myself.

293
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,817
This Rig goes
nowhere without me.

294
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,946
You can get in.

295
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,741
Not without them.

296
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,334
So we wait.

297
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,682
You're relying on the
gratitude of a very bad man.

298
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,895
You've damaged one of his wives. How
grateful do you think he's gonna be?

299
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:40,192
You're sitting on 2000 horsepower
of nitro-boosted war machine.

300
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,525
I'd say you got about a
five-minute head start.

301
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,334
You want that thing
off your face?

302
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,219
Let's go.

303
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,156
Ah, uh-uh.

304
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:55,268
Of all the legs you had to shoot, that
one was attached to his favorite.

305
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,951
Smeg!

306
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,977
You don't have to do it
just because he tells you.

307
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,521
- What choice does she have?
- He's not gonna hurt us. He needs us.

308
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:42,768
- Why?
- To bargain.

309
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:43,975
Oh, he'll hurt us.

310
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:45,947
Think he's coming
to the Green Place?

311
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,236
Never! He's a crazy smeg...

312
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,109
who eats Schlesinger!

313
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:16,935
Nah, stay out of there.

314
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:18,270
Behind you.

315
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,022
Huh?

316
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,569
The Gas Town Boys.

317
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,197
Don't damage the goods.

318
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,117
What do you see?

319
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,871
Big Rigs...

320
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,954
Polecats...

321
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:44,755
Flamers...

322
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,176
and there's the
People Eater himself.

323
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,296
Coming to count the cost.

324
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:53,547
Hmm.

325
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,477
Aah!

326
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:10,569
We're dragging
something out back.

327
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,158
I think it's the fuel pod.

328
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,025
No, no.

329
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:16,403
I'll go.

330
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,881
- Filth! You traitored him!
- Ah!

331
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:47,941
No unnecessary killing!

332
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,960
- This War Boy wants me dead!
- We agreed!

333
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:52,500
He's kamakrazee!

334
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,961
He's just a kid at the
end of his half-life!

335
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:57,259
No! I live. I die. I live again!

336
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,565
- Hold him!
- Tie him up!

337
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:00,799
Throw him out!

338
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,259
Chuck him out!

339
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:05,059
You got more friends.

340
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:08,812
Bullet Farmer.

341
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:11,231
- They're coming from the Bullet Farm.
- Yeah?

342
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:14,151
It's over. You can't defy him.

343
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:15,522
Just watch us, mate!

344
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:16,648
He is the one...

345
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:18,819
- who grabbed the sun.
- Look how slick he's fooled you.

346
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:20,828
- He's a lying old man.
- By his hand...

347
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,704
- we'll be lifted up!
- That's why we have...

348
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,494
his logo seared on our backs!

349
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,367
"Breeding Stock!"
"Battle Fodder!"

350
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,617
No, I am awaited!

351
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,083
- You're an old man's "Battle Fodder"!
- Killing everyone...

352
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,169
- and everything.
- We're not to blame!

353
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,799
Then who killed the world?

354
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,912
I made a deal up ahead.
Safe passage.

355
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,491
I don't know if it's
still any good.

356
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:08,372
Get back in the hold!

357
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,164
Keep the hatch open.

358
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,423
I need you here.

359
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,298
You may have to drive the Rig.

360
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,093
Mm.

361
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:28,803
You.

362
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:30,936
You stay.

363
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:33,233
You stay there.

364
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,190
Whatever you do,
you can't be seen.

365
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,238
I'm supposed to be alone.

366
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:42,986
That was the deal.

367
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:50,789
Down here.

368
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,680
Hey.

369
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:14,813
What's your name?

370
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:17,686
What do I call you?

371
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,272
Does it matter?

372
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:23,738
Fine.

373
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,368
When I yell "fool"...

374
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,909
you drive out of here
as fast as you can.

375
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,037
This is the sequence:

376
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,494
One. One, two.

377
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:34,791
One.

378
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,877
Red. Black. Go.

379
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:39,799
You have it?

380
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,758
It's all here!

381
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,975
Three thousand gallons of
guzzoline, just like you asked!

382
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,730
I'm gonna unhitch the pod.

383
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,226
You drop the rocks.

384
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,156
You said:

385
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,870
"A few vehicles in pursuit.

386
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:33,580
Maybe."

387
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:35,032
We count three War Parties!

388
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,790
Yeah, well, I got unlucky.

389
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,747
Let's do this!

390
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:08,407
Fool!

391
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,783
That's our fuel!

392
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,507
Make way for the Ripsaw!

393
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:12,967
Come on! Move them!

394
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:23,807
Once I'm over...

395
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:26,277
clear the rocks and
bring everyone through.

396
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:27,518
Immortan!

397
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,772
Immortan Joe!

398
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:33,276
I got a War Boy! Says
he was on the War Rig.

399
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,571
You! Climb aboard!

400
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:41,075
Hey. Hey!

401
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:43,293
I got his boot!

402
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,537
I got the Blood Bag's boot!

403
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:47,460
Take me!

404
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,299
I got his boot!

405
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,921
All this for a family squabble.

406
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,595
Healthy babies.

407
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,289
Aah!

408
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:05,885
Reload the clip.

409
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:07,512
I can't.

410
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:15,436
Gun!

411
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:17,610
Gimme the gun!

412
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:18,448
Not loaded yet!

413
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:19,316
Now!

414
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:20,566
We had a deal!

415
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:23,324
Ugh!

416
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:10,625
Rictus!

417
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,123
The wives!

418
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,712
No more flames.

419
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,720
Splendid!

420
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,338
Splendid!

421
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:24,589
That's my child!

422
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,174
My property!

423
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:30,177
Immorta...

424
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:43,610
Immortan. If I get on the
Rig, there's a way inside.

425
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:45,827
- What is your name?
- It's Nux.

426
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,492
I'll pike her in the spine.
Keep her breathing.

427
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:49,739
No.

428
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,575
Put a bullet in her skull.

429
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,544
Stop the Rig, return
my treasures to me...

430
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:57,210
and I, myself, will carry you...

431
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:58,923
to the Gates...

432
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:00,418
of Valhalla.

433
00:57:01,043 --> 00:57:02,169
Am I awaited?

434
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:04,467
You will ride eternal...

435
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:07,016
shiny and chrome.

436
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,722
Rictus!

437
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:12,062
Help him aboard!

438
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:15,222
Ready?

439
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:16,691
Here we go!

440
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,485
Aah!

441
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,570
Mediocre!

442
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:01,103
Schlanger!

443
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,542
Look out!

444
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:26,836
Angharad!

445
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:28,546
Get out!

446
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:51,027
No!

447
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,361
Angharad!

448
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:09,088
Stop! Turn the Rig around!

449
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:11,515
Go back for her!

450
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:13,841
No.

451
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:15,511
Tell him to turn the Rig around!

452
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:16,808
Did you see it?

453
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,268
She went under the wheels.

454
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,891
Did you see it?

455
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,277
She went under the wheels.

456
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:26,651
We keep moving.

457
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:28,097
- No!
- We keep moving!

458
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,818
He doesn't know what
he's talking about!

459
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:33,070
Whatever happens, we're
going to the Green Place.

460
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,698
The stupid Green Place. We don't
even know where to find it!

461
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:50,804
- You all right?
- On! On!

462
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:30,051
Cheedo!

463
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:31,966
Cheedo, don't be stupid.

464
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:32,963
Stop!

465
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:34,760
He'll forgive us.
I know he will.

466
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,178
There is no going back!

467
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:38,264
- We were his treasures!
- Cheedo!

468
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:41,229
We were protected! He
gave us the high life!

469
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,224
- What's wrong with that?
- We are not things.

470
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:45,225
No!

471
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:47,683
We are not things!

472
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:49,185
We are not things.

473
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:52,320
- I don't want to hear that again!
- They were her words!

474
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:53,738
And now she's dead!

475
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:56,278
Wring your hands and
tear your hair...

476
01:00:56,528 --> 01:00:57,996
but you're not going back.

477
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:00,244
You're not going back to him.

478
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,490
Angharad!

479
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,535
Come on! Come on!

480
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:23,268
So, um, ahem...

481
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:25,144
where is this...

482
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,227
Green Place?

483
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:31,484
It's a long night's
run, heading east.

484
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:35,116
We need inventory.

485
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,735
Match every gun
with its bullets.

486
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:43,412
I'm gonna go and
do some repairs.

487
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,080
We need someone down the back.

488
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:46,078
I'll go.

489
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:47,045
No.

490
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:49,039
I want you to stay together.

491
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:50,875
I can do it.

492
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,207
What are you doing here?

493
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:27,877
He saw it.

494
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:29,875
He saw it all.

495
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:33,792
My own Blood Bag driving
the Rig that killed her.

496
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:42,766
Stop doing that.

497
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:46,096
Shh. Shh, shh, shh.

498
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:47,438
Stop.

499
01:02:57,565 --> 01:03:00,364
Three times the gates
were open to me.

500
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:01,653
What gates?

501
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:04,160
I was awaited in Valhalla.

502
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:05,991
They were calling my name.

503
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:10,538
I should be walking with the Immorta.
McFeasting with the heroes of all time.

504
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,964
I'd say it was your
manifest destiny not to.

505
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,469
I thought I was being
spared for something great.

506
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:25,185
I got to drive a
pursuit vehicle.

507
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:29,140
For a while even Larry and Barry
stopped chewing on my windpipe.

508
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:31,187
Who are Larry and Barry?

509
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,310
My mates.

510
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:35,149
Larry and Barry.

511
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:39,782
If they don't get me, then
the Night Fevers will.

512
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:08,099
Well, we've only got four for Big
Boy here, so he's all but useless.

513
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:10,646
But...

514
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:14,894
we can squirt off this little
pinky a raunchy 29 times.

515
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:19,440
Angharad used to
call them Antiseed.

516
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,613
Plant one and watch
something die.

517
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:40,437
Hold on, mate.

518
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:01,000
We are down 30,000
units of guzzoline...

519
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:04,128
19 canisters of nitro,
12 assault bikes...

520
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:06,251
seven pursuit vehicles.

521
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,006
The deficit mounts.

522
01:06:08,256 --> 01:06:09,348
And now, sir...

523
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,556
you have us stuck in a quagmire.

524
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:14,266
Hey, Joe!

525
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,272
Boss!

526
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:20,527
Your girly's breathing her last!

527
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:23,067
What about the child?

528
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,782
Are you coming, brother?

529
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:35,124
Wait!

530
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,960
It's gone awful quiet in there.

531
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:39,375
Get it out.

532
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:40,873
Get it out!

533
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,836
Come on! I've been
called to the torture!

534
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:47,587
Patience!

535
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:51,883
Oh, you stay here with
your grief, Daddy.

536
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:55,307
- I'll fetch them for you.
- Be careful! Protect the assets!

537
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:00,184
Just one angry shot...

538
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:02,481
for Furiosa.

539
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:03,727
Hut!

540
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:04,937
Yeah!

541
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:13,663
Crying shame. Heh.

542
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:15,031
Come.

543
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:17,157
Another month...

544
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:19,835
could have been
your viable human!

545
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:21,421
Was it a male?

546
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:23,256
Your A-1 Alpha prime.

547
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:27,756
Hey, Rictus!

548
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:30,805
You lost a baby brother!

549
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:35,010
Perfect in every way.

550
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,351
I had a baby brother!

551
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:41,732
I had a little baby brother!

552
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:43,773
And he was perfect!

553
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:45,895
Perfect in every way!

554
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:17,760
Come on.

555
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,855
Wouldn't wanna shoot
the wives, sir.

556
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,197
Just probing.

557
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,127
He wants to help!

558
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:44,369
Who?

559
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:45,755
The War Boy!

560
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:47,419
Where did he come from?

561
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:49,065
I thought we threw
him off the Rig!

562
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:54,505
There's high ground...

563
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:56,676
- just beyond that thing.
- He means the tree.

564
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,559
Yeah. Tree!

565
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:00,804
Leave him to me.

566
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:04,558
Say, anyone notice that bright light?
Encroaching gunfire?

567
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:05,934
Get out.

568
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:07,310
I can do this. I
know this machine.

569
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,153
He does. He's a Revhead.

570
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:15,735
You've got two left!

571
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:23,242
On him.

572
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:42,478
Don't breathe.

573
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,726
Ugh!

574
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:47,024
Hey!

575
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:48,609
Hey! Hey!

576
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:49,852
War Boy!

577
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:52,697
I'm gonna use the winch
around the tree thing!

578
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:54,774
Take this.

579
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,742
Let's get the engine plates.

580
01:09:57,985 --> 01:09:58,985
You drive the Rig!

581
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,038
- Hold up a flare!
- I am holding a flare!

582
01:10:01,823 --> 01:10:04,201
- Closer!
- It's right in front of your eyes!

583
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:06,243
Aah!

584
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:18,264
Hut! Hut!

585
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:25,854
Blood Bag!

586
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,689
I am the scales of justice!

587
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:37,525
Conductor of the choir of death!

588
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:40,407
Sing, Brother Heckler.

589
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,664
Sing, Brother Koch!

590
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:50,167
Sing, brothers, sing! Sing!

591
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:52,849
Don't they know they're
shooting at us?

592
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:08,560
Gun fever!

593
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:21,133
I never thought I'd do
something as shine as that.

594
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:23,139
How are the engines?

595
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:25,220
Very hot and real thirsty.

596
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:34,101
Hey. You need to take the War Rig
half a klick down the track.

597
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:38,192
What if you're not back by the
time the engines have cooled?

598
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:41,949
Well, you keep moving.

599
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,415
What do you suppose
he's gonna do?

600
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:56,042
Retaliate first.

601
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:00,634
Let's go!

602
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:23,008
- Are you hurt?
- Huh?

603
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:24,467
You're bleeding.

604
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:26,671
That's not his blood.

605
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,841
What is this?

606
01:14:30,758 --> 01:14:31,930
It's Mother's Milk.

607
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:15,469
It's okay.

608
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:16,767
Sleep.

609
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:19,474
Get some rest.

610
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:32,536
How do you know this
place even exists?

611
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:36,699
I was born there.

612
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:40,085
So why'd you leave?

613
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:41,666
I didn't.

614
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:45,170
I was taken as a child.

615
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:48,043
Stolen.

616
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:55,809
You done this before?

617
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:57,846
Many times.

618
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:01,144
Now that I drive a War Rig...

619
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:04,898
this is the best
shot I'll ever have.

620
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:07,150
And them?

621
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:10,692
They're looking for hope.

622
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:13,111
What about you?

623
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:19,871
Redemption.

624
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:05,750
Hey, what's that?

625
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:20,470
I remember something like that.

626
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:34,278
Help me!

627
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:38,954
Help me!

628
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:43,746
- Help me, please!
- Uh, uh.

629
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,245
Please!

630
01:17:45,953 --> 01:17:47,079
That's bait.

631
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:49,916
Stay in the Rig.

632
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:58,050
Hurry! Please, hurry!
They'll be back!

633
01:17:59,466 --> 01:18:00,466
I am one of...

634
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:01,803
the Vuvalini!

635
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:04,559
Of the Many Mothers!

636
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:09,360
My Initiate Mother was K.T.
Concannon!

637
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:13,193
I am the daughter
of Mary Jabassa.

638
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:17,242
My clan was Swaddle Dog!

639
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:05,745
It's me.

640
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:15,543
There's something in the eyes.

641
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:18,179
Perhaps it is Jabassa's child.

642
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:24,259
This is our Furiosa.

643
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:29,098
How long has it been?

644
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:32,101
Seven thousand days.

645
01:19:32,726 --> 01:19:34,820
Plus the ones I don't remember.

646
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,277
Furiosa.

647
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:40,364
What happened to your mother?

648
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:43,162
She died.

649
01:19:43,988 --> 01:19:45,661
On the third day.

650
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:53,922
From where did you come?

651
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:58,011
The West. Citadel.
Beyond the mountains.

652
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:02,924
The men.

653
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:04,345
Who are they?

654
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:05,934
They're reliable.

655
01:20:06,343 --> 01:20:08,016
They helped us get here.

656
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:22,117
Where did you find
such creatures?

657
01:20:24,695 --> 01:20:25,992
So soft.

658
01:20:26,697 --> 01:20:28,119
This one has all her teeth!

659
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:34,788
Oh.

660
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:39,335
I can't wait for them to see it.

661
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,086
See?

662
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:43,506
See what?

663
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:45,008
Home.

664
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:50,513
The Green Place.

665
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:52,891
But if you came from the West...

666
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:55,479
you passed it.

667
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:58,278
The crows.

668
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:01,065
The creepy place
with all the crows.

669
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:03,492
- The soil.
- We had to get out.

670
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:05,532
- We had no water.
- The water was filth.

671
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:07,405
It was poisoned. It was sour.

672
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:09,031
And then the crows came.

673
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:11,033
We couldn't grow anything.

674
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:12,626
Where are the others?

675
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:13,868
What others?

676
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:15,250
The Many Mothers.

677
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:16,998
We're the only ones left.

678
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:19,059
Look.

679
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,023
That's what you
call a satellite.

680
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,026
Miss Giddy told us about those.

681
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:30,453
They used to bounce
messages across the Earth.

682
01:22:31,238 --> 01:22:32,785
Shows.

683
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:35,329
Everyone in the old
world had a show.

684
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:38,503
Do you think there's still...

685
01:22:38,745 --> 01:22:40,042
somebody out there?

686
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:42,795
Sending shows?

687
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:44,426
Who knows?

688
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:47,797
Those are the Plains of Silence.

689
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:52,472
Stay right where you
are, little Joe.

690
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:54,846
Kind of lost its
novelty out here.

691
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:56,688
You having a baby?

692
01:22:57,764 --> 01:22:59,232
Warlord Junior.

693
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:00,727
Gonna be so ugly.

694
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:02,773
It could be a girl.

695
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,239
You kill people
with that, do you?

696
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:08,571
Killed everyone I
ever met out here.

697
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:11,161
Headshots. All of them. Snap.
Right in the medulla.

698
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:13,371
Thought somehow you
girls were above that.

699
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:19,165
Come here.

700
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:27,878
Take a peek.

701
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:30,131
Seeds.

702
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:32,599
These are from home.

703
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:35,014
Heirlooms. The real thing.

704
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:37,520
I plant one every chance I get.

705
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:38,764
Where?

706
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:42,063
So far, nothing's took.
Earth's too sour.

707
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:44,144
Aah. So many different kinds.

708
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:46,484
Trees, flowers, fruit.

709
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:49,567
Back then, everyone
had their fill.

710
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:52,494
Back then, there was no
need to snap anybody.

711
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:09,126
Can I talk to you?

712
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:31,112
I've talked with the others.

713
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:41,160
We're never gonna have a better
chance to make it across the salt.

714
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:47,333
If we leave the Rig here, and load the
motorcycles up with as much as we can...

715
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:50,086
we can maybe ride for 160 days.

716
01:24:52,796 --> 01:24:54,764
One of those bikes is yours.

717
01:24:55,882 --> 01:24:57,134
Fully loaded.

718
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:02,435
You're more than welcome
to come with us.

719
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:08,403
I'll make my own way.

720
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:17,162
You know, hope is a mistake.

721
01:25:24,036 --> 01:25:27,336
If you can't fix what's
broken, you'll, uh...

722
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:30,884
You'll go insane.

723
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:48,686
<i>Where are you, Max?</i>

724
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:52,026
<i>Where are you?</i>

725
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:55,697
<i>Help us. You
promised to help us.</i>

726
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:08,372
<i>Come on, Pa! Let's go.</i>

727
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,412
All right.

728
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:44,912
This is your way home.

729
01:26:48,412 --> 01:26:49,459
We go back?

730
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:51,460
Mm.

731
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:53,505
- Back?
- Yeah.

732
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,468
I thought you weren't
insane anymore.

733
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:56,928
What are they saying?

734
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:59,389
He wants to go back
from where they came.

735
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:00,803
The Citadel.

736
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,223
What's there to find
at the Citadel?

737
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:05,186
Green.

738
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:06,772
And water.

739
01:27:08,014 --> 01:27:11,894
There's a ridiculous amount of clear water.
And a lot of crops.

740
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:14,584
Got everything you need. Long as
you're not afraid of heights.

741
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:16,053
Where does the water come from?

742
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:19,864
He pumps it up from deep in the earth.
Calls it Aqua Cola and claims it for himself.

743
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:22,363
And because he owns it,
he owns all of us.

744
01:27:22,612 --> 01:27:23,784
I don't like him already.

745
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:26,408
It'll take two weeks to skirt
the Wall of Mountains.

746
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:27,658
No.

747
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:30,545
I suggest we go back
the same way we came.

748
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,673
Through the canyon.

749
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:38,588
It's open. We know that. Right? He
brought all his war parties through.

750
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:42,466
So we take the War Rig and we charge
it right through the middle of them.

751
01:27:42,716 --> 01:27:43,876
We can decouple the tanker...

752
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:45,219
at the pass.

753
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:47,096
Shut it off behind us.

754
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:48,471
Kaboom.

755
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:53,857
And how exactly do
we take the Citadel?

756
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:56,192
Assuming we're still
alive by then.

757
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:59,032
If we can block the
pass, it'll be easy.

758
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:03,029
All that's left are his War Pups
and War Boys too sick to fight.

759
01:28:03,737 --> 01:28:05,489
And we'll be with Nux.

760
01:28:06,156 --> 01:28:07,373
He's a War Boy.

761
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:10,496
He'll be bringing us home. Bringing
back what's stolen, as he's meant to.

762
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:14,835
Yeah.

763
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:17,384
It feels like hope.

764
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:20,132
I like this plan.

765
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:21,713
We can start again.

766
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,053
Just like the old days!

767
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:26,851
Look.

768
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:29,270
It'll be a hard day.

769
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:32,816
But I guarantee you that a
160 days' ride that way...

770
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:37,191
there's nothing but salt.

771
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:42,527
At least that way, you know,
we might be able to...

772
01:28:44,027 --> 01:28:45,279
together...

773
01:28:46,863 --> 01:28:48,957
come across some
kind of redemption.

774
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:21,106
War Rig!

775
01:29:21,398 --> 01:29:23,321
That's the War Rig!

776
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:34,543
That's them.

777
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:36,038
Why are they going back?

778
01:29:36,496 --> 01:29:38,169
Do they wish to surrender?

779
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:40,376
They are heading for the canyon.

780
01:29:42,252 --> 01:29:45,222
They're going back
to the Citadel!

781
01:29:45,463 --> 01:29:47,136
They know it's undefended!

782
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:48,474
Bollocks!

783
01:29:49,843 --> 01:29:50,969
Roll up!

784
01:30:01,271 --> 01:30:02,523
Go!

785
01:30:24,878 --> 01:30:26,380
- What are you doing?
- Praying.

786
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:27,630
To who?

787
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:29,307
Anyone that's listening.

788
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:54,698
Here we go, girls!

789
01:30:57,327 --> 01:30:58,579
That's mine!

790
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:04,926
He'll try to get in front of us.
Spike our wheels.

791
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:13,264
Don't blow my engine.

792
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:14,803
Gonna nudge him.

793
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:16,145
Just a little.

794
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:32,079
You filth! You traitored him!

795
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:37,950
Yeah!

796
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:56,811
Go.

797
01:31:58,847 --> 01:32:00,394
Aah! Aah!

798
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:11,526
Ha!

799
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:13,527
Aah!

800
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:24,288
Gotta back off.

801
01:32:24,998 --> 01:32:27,421
Engine one is gone.
Two's about to blow.

802
01:32:27,667 --> 01:32:28,667
Right.

803
01:32:29,169 --> 01:32:30,169
Are you a Black Thumb?

804
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:31,383
Uh-huh.

805
01:32:31,629 --> 01:32:32,881
All right. Engine one. Now.

806
01:32:33,131 --> 01:32:34,474
You and me. Fifth wheel.

807
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:36,009
We'll unhook the tanker.

808
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:49,646
One man, one bullet.

809
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:09,167
- I cannot see.
- Maadi! Maadi!

810
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:10,589
I can't see.

811
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:31,605
Oh.

812
01:33:49,999 --> 01:33:50,999
Hey!

813
01:33:51,209 --> 01:33:52,711
Harpoons and plows!

814
01:33:53,128 --> 01:33:54,345
They're hauling us back!

815
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:07,817
Leave three bolts. Three.

816
01:35:26,346 --> 01:35:27,346
Hey, you! Aargh!

817
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:44,284
Are you okay?

818
01:35:46,991 --> 01:35:48,618
I think she's hurt.

819
01:36:12,475 --> 01:36:13,475
Hey!

820
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:40,219
No!

821
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:45,590
No!

822
01:36:50,388 --> 01:36:51,731
<i>Hey.</i>

823
01:36:52,265 --> 01:36:53,265
<i>Stay with me.</i>

824
01:36:53,516 --> 01:36:55,268
<i>- Stay with me.</i>
- Stay with me.

825
01:36:55,518 --> 01:36:56,895
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey! Are you there?

826
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:00,251
You finish that!
I'll finish her!

827
01:37:08,406 --> 01:37:09,406
Unh!

828
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:31,613
Valhalla!

829
01:38:45,837 --> 01:38:47,009
Aah!

830
01:38:52,969 --> 01:38:53,969
Ha!

831
01:39:12,321 --> 01:39:13,321
Engine one's good.

832
01:39:14,282 --> 01:39:15,454
For now.

833
01:40:03,664 --> 01:40:05,086
She's hurt! She's hurt...

834
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:06,380
real bad!

835
01:40:27,813 --> 01:40:28,813
Aah!

836
01:41:36,757 --> 01:41:37,757
You hear that?

837
01:41:38,426 --> 01:41:40,019
We're gonna see
two airborne V8s.

838
01:41:41,554 --> 01:41:43,272
I'm gonna need you to drive.

839
01:41:45,474 --> 01:41:47,147
I'll get him out of our way.

840
01:42:54,168 --> 01:42:55,465
Rictus!

841
01:42:56,545 --> 01:42:57,545
Take me!

842
01:43:10,976 --> 01:43:11,727
Cheedo!

843
01:43:11,977 --> 01:43:13,524
- What are you doing?
- Good girl.

844
01:43:17,858 --> 01:43:18,984
- Come here.
- Aah!

845
01:43:21,278 --> 01:43:22,575
Aah!

846
01:43:24,407 --> 01:43:25,407
Big Boy!

847
01:43:26,367 --> 01:43:28,040
Aah!

848
01:43:31,539 --> 01:43:33,382
Here! Here!

849
01:43:51,642 --> 01:43:52,642
Unh!

850
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:28,433
Remember me?

851
01:44:31,265 --> 01:44:32,265
Aah!

852
01:44:49,784 --> 01:44:50,831
He's dead!

853
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:52,832
He's dead.

854
01:45:11,847 --> 01:45:14,817
When you're across safe, I'll jam
the throttle and follow you.

855
01:45:15,601 --> 01:45:16,648
Come on!

856
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:20,277
Hurry! We're nearly at the pass.

857
01:46:07,903 --> 01:46:09,496
Witness me.

858
01:46:15,953 --> 01:46:16,954
Rictus!

859
01:47:12,551 --> 01:47:14,178
Why is she making that noise?

860
01:47:14,428 --> 01:47:16,146
She's pumping air into
her chest cavity.

861
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:18,561
She's collapsing her lungs...

862
01:47:18,807 --> 01:47:20,605
one breath at a time.

863
01:47:26,357 --> 01:47:27,529
I know.

864
01:47:30,486 --> 01:47:31,954
I am so sorry.

865
01:47:34,698 --> 01:47:35,950
I know. I know.

866
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:38,544
Hold it there.

867
01:47:39,411 --> 01:47:40,503
All right.

868
01:47:41,038 --> 01:47:43,882
Put that on there. Press it in.
Hey.

869
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:45,921
Hey.

870
01:47:46,168 --> 01:47:47,294
Home.

871
01:47:54,593 --> 01:47:55,936
Home.

872
01:48:02,351 --> 01:48:04,399
- No, no, no. No, no, no.
- She's exsanguinated.

873
01:48:04,645 --> 01:48:05,965
- Drained all her blood.
- Well...

874
01:48:07,523 --> 01:48:08,615
Hold these.

875
01:48:09,441 --> 01:48:10,441
We need that.

876
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:12,532
Needle.

877
01:48:13,529 --> 01:48:14,529
Come on.

878
01:48:15,823 --> 01:48:16,823
Take this.

879
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:20,660
Keep her awake.

880
01:48:21,370 --> 01:48:22,622
Furiosa.

881
01:48:26,291 --> 01:48:28,464
Okay, that's not retracting.

882
01:48:29,128 --> 01:48:30,345
There we go.

883
01:48:31,213 --> 01:48:33,136
All right, hold it up.
Hold it up.

884
01:48:34,717 --> 01:48:35,889
All right.

885
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:37,260
Sorry.

886
01:48:39,346 --> 01:48:41,815
There you go. Okay.
There you go.

887
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:55,536
Max.

888
01:48:56,864 --> 01:48:58,366
My name is Max.

889
01:48:59,867 --> 01:49:02,416
Yeah. Mm-hm.

890
01:49:02,745 --> 01:49:04,167
Mm.

891
01:49:07,124 --> 01:49:08,717
That's my name.

892
01:49:50,584 --> 01:49:51,584
Brake!

893
01:49:57,132 --> 01:49:58,258
Reveal yourself.

894
01:50:17,402 --> 01:50:18,699
He's got something.

895
01:50:25,994 --> 01:50:26,994
It's Immortan Joe.

896
01:50:27,663 --> 01:50:29,085
The Immortan Joe is dead!

897
01:50:56,275 --> 01:50:57,527
Furiosa!

898
01:50:57,818 --> 01:50:58,990
Furiosa!

899
01:50:59,236 --> 01:51:00,328
Furiosa!

900
01:51:00,571 --> 01:51:01,697
Furiosa!

901
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:03,873
Furiosa!

902
01:51:04,241 --> 01:51:05,663
She's back.

903
01:51:05,909 --> 01:51:08,503
<i>Let them up! Let them up!</i>

904
01:51:08,745 --> 01:51:10,213
<i>Let them up!</i>

905
01:51:10,455 --> 01:51:12,503
<i>Let them up! Let them up!</i>

906
01:51:15,878 --> 01:51:16,958
Come on, let's do it!

907
01:51:17,171 --> 01:51:18,673
Let them up. Come on.

908
01:51:51,205 --> 01:51:52,502
Come on.
