I got to toughen this kid up.

HENRY:
lt was a glorious time.

00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,584
And wiseguys were all over the place.

157
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,505
lt was before Apalachin
and before Crazy Joe. . .

It was when I met the worId.

160
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,180
And it was when I first met
Jimmy Conway.

161
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,810
He couIdn't have been more than 28 or 29
at the time. . .

162
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,895
but he was already a legend.

163
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:33,066
He'd walk in the door and everybody
who worked the room just went wild.

164
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,819
He'd give the doorman $1 00
just for opening the door.

165
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:39,906
He'd give hundreds to the dealers
and the guys who ran the games.

166
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:43,034
The bartender got $1 00
just for keeping the ice cubes cold.

167
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,287
The Irishman is here
to take all you guineas' money.

168
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,252
-Want a drink?
-Give me a 7 and 7.

-I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.
-How you doing?

-Thank you.
-Keep them coming.

HENRY: Jimmy was one of the most
feared guys in the city.

172
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,814
He was first locked up at 1 1 . . .

173
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:16,067
and he was doing hits
for mob bosses when he was 1 6.

174
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,028
See, hits never bothered Jimmy.
It was business.

But what Jimmy really loved to do. . .

176
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,742
what he really loved to do was steal.

177

He actually enjoyed it.

178
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:30,206
Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted
for the bad guys in the movies.

shrimp and lobsters.

Shrimp and lobsters were best.
They went really fast.

184
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:52,270
Almost all of them were gimmies.
They just gave it up, no problem.

185
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,105
They called him Jimmy the Gent.

186

02:13:08,772 --> 02:13:13,192
He took the booth near the window
so he could see everyone who drove up.

2085
02:13:13,527 --> 02:13:15,903
He wanted to make sure I wasn't taiIed.

2086
02:13:16,321 --> 02:13:19,198
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing.

2087
02:13:20,242 --> 02:13:23,244
On the surface,
everything was supposed to be fine.

2088
02:13:23,412 --> 02:13:25,746
We were supposed to be discussing
my case.

2089
02:13:25,914 --> 02:13:30,876
But l had a feeling Jimmy was trying
to sense if l'd rat on him to save my neck.

2090
02:13:32,546 --> 02:13:36,257
I been telling you your whole life,
don't talk on the phone.

2091
02:13:36,466 --> 02:13:38,259
Now you understand?

2092
02:13:40,929 --> 02:13:44,265
It's going to be okay.
You got a good chance to beat the case.

2093
02:13:47,436 --> 02:13:51,689
You know that kid from the city
we were talking about? You know?

2094
02:13:54,109 --> 02:13:58,320
The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon as
he got pinched, he ratted on everybody.

2095
02:14:01,116 --> 02:14:03,034
I know where he is. He's hiding now.

2096
02:14:04,953 --> 02:14:06,287
Know what I'm saying?

2097
02:14:11,293 --> 02:14:14,462
Would you have a problem going
with Anthony to take care of that?

2098
02:14:15,047 --> 02:14:16,630
Mm-mm.

2099
02:14:17,549 --> 02:14:18,799
No, not at all.

2100
02:14:20,427 --> 02:14:22,011
That way they got nothing.

2101
02:14:30,854 --> 02:14:33,606
HENRY: Jimmy had never asked me
to whack somebody before.

2102
02:14:34,066 --> 02:14:37,735
But now he's asking me to go to Florida
and do a hit with Anthony.

2103
02:14:45,285 --> 02:14:48,621
That's when I knew I wouId never
have come back from FIorida aIive.

2104
02:15:03,011 --> 02:15:06,305
Whenever you move me,
I asked once and I'll tell you again. . .

2105
02:15:06,473 --> 02:15:08,307
I don't want to go any place cold.

2106
02:15:09,309 --> 02:15:11,477
You don't have a choice in that matter.

2107
02:15:11,853 --> 02:15:14,396
Come on. Whoever fucking controls it. . .

2108
02:15:15,190 --> 02:15:17,858
just no place cold. Do that for me.
I'm trying to--

2109
02:15:18,026 --> 02:15:19,735
He's bronchial, that's why.

2110
02:15:19,903 --> 02:15:22,488
If he's legitimately bronchial,
we'll consider that.

2111
02:15:22,656 --> 02:15:24,865
I'd like to go someplace not cold.

2112
02:15:25,033 --> 02:15:28,744
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?

2113
02:15:29,871 --> 02:15:30,871
What about them?

2114
02:15:31,039 --> 02:15:33,499
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?

2115
02:15:34,751 --> 02:15:37,169
Don't I have some kind of contact
with them?

2116
02:15:37,838 --> 02:15:38,879
No.

2117
02:15:40,006 --> 02:15:43,342
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me that. . .

2118
02:15:43,718 --> 02:15:47,721
God forbid something happens to my
parents, they get sick, I can't see them?

2119
02:15:47,889 --> 02:15:50,891
Maybe something can be worked out
if they're sick. . .

2120
02:15:51,393 --> 02:15:53,561
if there's extraordinary circumstances--

2121
02:15:53,728 --> 02:15:56,564
I can't do this. I can't do this, Henry.

2122
02:15:57,691 --> 02:15:59,441
I can't leave my parents.

2123
02:16:00,694 --> 02:16:02,903
Excuse me, Karen, I told you before.

2124
02:16:04,156 --> 02:16:07,158
I'm not going to do this
unless you and the kids come with me.

2125
02:16:09,494 --> 02:16:11,162
I can't do it without you.

2126
02:16:11,580 --> 02:16:15,666
So, you do whatever, but. . .that's it.

2127
02:16:17,210 --> 02:16:19,753
-You need Henry, not me, right?
-That's right.

2128
02:16:20,088 --> 02:16:22,548
Frankly, I don't care
whether you go or not.

2129
02:16:22,883 --> 02:16:26,177
If it'll make him a better witness,
I'd like you to be with him.

2130
02:16:26,344 --> 02:16:28,012
They want Henry, not me.

2131
02:16:28,180 --> 02:16:31,265
Henry'll be in the protection program.
They can't get to him.

2132
02:16:32,184 --> 02:16:35,603
They can only get to him
by getting to you or your kids.

2133
02:16:35,770 --> 02:16:38,189
If he goes into the program,
you're in danger--

2134
02:16:38,356 --> 02:16:40,774
-I don't know anything.
-Don't give me. . .

2135
02:16:40,942 --> 02:16:42,318
the babe-in-the-woods routine.

2136
02:16:42,485 --> 02:16:47,072
I've listened to those wiretaps,
and I've heard you talk about cocaine.

2137
02:16:47,240 --> 02:16:50,451
Conversation after conversation
you talked to Henry on the phone.

2138
02:16:55,707 --> 02:16:57,750
It doesn't matter.
Whether he goes to jail. . .

2139
02:16:57,918 --> 02:17:01,212
or stays on the streets and beats the case,
he's a dead man.

2140
02:17:01,963 --> 02:17:03,672
He knows it and you know it.

2141
02:17:05,300 --> 02:17:07,009
What about the kids and school?

2142
02:17:07,177 --> 02:17:09,470
KAREN: Will they get left back?
l mean, what goes on?

2143
02:17:09,804 --> 02:17:12,223
TUDDY:
Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.

2144
02:17:12,390 --> 02:17:14,850
Whoever sold you those suits
had a sense of humor.

2145
02:17:15,060 --> 02:17:18,103
What it comes down to is
we're your only salvation.

2146
02:17:18,939 --> 02:17:22,358
We'll save your life and his life,
and we'll keep you out of jail.

2147
02:17:26,613 --> 02:17:29,240
This morning you told the jury
about your background.

2148
02:17:29,407 --> 02:17:31,242
HENRY:
lt was easy for us to disappear.

2149
02:17:31,785 --> 02:17:33,911
My house
was in my mother-in-law's name.

2150
02:17:34,079 --> 02:17:36,038
My cars were registered to my wife.

2151
02:17:36,206 --> 02:17:39,667
My Social Security cards
and driver's licenses were phonies.

2152
02:17:39,834 --> 02:17:42,169
l never voted or paid taxes.

2153
02:17:42,754 --> 02:17:47,216
My birth certificate and arrest sheet was
all you'd ever have to know l was alive.

2154
02:17:47,384 --> 02:17:49,343
ATTORNEY:
Do you see him here in this courtroom?

2155
02:17:49,511 --> 02:17:50,511
Yes.

2156
02:17:50,679 --> 02:17:52,763
ATTORNEY:
Will you please point him out for the jury?

2157
02:17:55,350 --> 02:17:59,979
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, James Conway.

2158
02:18:01,106 --> 02:18:04,191
Do you also know a man
named Paul Cicero?

2159
02:18:04,526 --> 02:18:06,527
-Do you see him in the courtroom?
-Yes.

2160
02:18:07,112 --> 02:18:09,029
ATTORNEY:
Can you point him out for the jury?

2161
02:18:10,991 --> 02:18:15,119
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, Paul Cicero.

2162
02:18:16,413 --> 02:18:18,122
Your Honor, I have a document. . . .

2163
02:18:18,290 --> 02:18:20,708
HENRY:
The hardest thing was leaving the life.

2164
02:18:21,459 --> 02:18:23,002
I stiII Iove the Iife.

2165
02:18:23,378 --> 02:18:25,296
We were treated Iike movie stars
with muscIe.

2166
02:18:25,463 --> 02:18:27,715
We had it all, just for the asking.

2167
02:18:27,882 --> 02:18:31,218
Our wives, mothers, kids,
everybody rode along.

2168
02:18:31,553 --> 02:18:34,722
l had paper bags filled with jewelry
stashed in the kitchen.

2169
02:18:34,889 --> 02:18:37,141
l had a sugar bowl full of coke
next to the bed.

2170
02:18:37,309 --> 02:18:41,103
People call them rats because rats do
anything to survive. Isn't that right?

2171
02:18:41,271 --> 02:18:43,314
ATTORNEY: Objection !
JUDGE: Objection sustained.

2172
02:18:43,481 --> 02:18:46,567
-I know nothing about being a rat.
-You know everything about it.

2173
02:18:47,569 --> 02:18:49,111
ATTORNEY: Objection, Your Honor.
In view of the violence. . . .

2174
02:18:49,279 --> 02:18:51,405
HENRY:
Anything l wanted was a phone call away.

2175
02:18:51,573 --> 02:18:54,992
Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideout flats
all over the city.

2176
02:18:55,160 --> 02:18:57,661
l'd bet $20,000, $30,000
over a weekend. . .

2177
02:18:57,829 --> 02:19:01,999
then blow the winnings in a week
or go to the sharks to pay the bookies.

2178
02:19:02,167 --> 02:19:03,375
It didn't matter.

2179
02:19:03,918 --> 02:19:08,797
It didn't mean anything. When I was broke
I would go out and rob some more.

2180
02:19:09,215 --> 02:19:10,591
We ran everything.

2181
02:19:11,134 --> 02:19:15,429
We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.

2182
02:19:15,680 --> 02:19:19,099
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.

2183
02:19:21,227 --> 02:19:22,728
And now it's all over.

2184
02:19:23,646 --> 02:19:25,105
That's the hardest part.

2185
02:19:26,107 --> 02:19:27,733
Today everything is different.

2186
02:19:27,901 --> 02:19:32,071
There's no action.
l have to wait around like everyone else.

2187
02:19:32,447 --> 02:19:34,239
Can't even get decent food.

2188
02:19:34,991 --> 02:19:38,118
After l got here l ordered spaghetti
with marinara sauce. . .

2189
02:19:38,286 --> 02:19:40,120
and l got egg noodles and ketchup.

2190
02:19:40,955 --> 02:19:42,456
l'm an average nobody.

2191
02:19:43,833 --> 02:19:46,627
l get to live the rest of my life
Iike a schnook.

2192
02:25:23,214 --> 02:25:25,215
