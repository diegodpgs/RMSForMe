1
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,804
Did you see what I saw? Come on,
open her up. We'll have a big day today.

2
00:04:11,145 --> 00:04:13,773
- You're in a hurry?
- Yeah, I sure am.

3
00:04:14,024 --> 00:04:17,861
You're a fool Come on.

4
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:23,908
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
Let us begin.

5
00:04:25,744 --> 00:04:29,123
Would the bride and groom
kindly step forward?

6
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:33,627
Will Kane and Amy Fowler,

7
00:04:33,877 --> 00:04:38,549
you appear before me in my capacity
as Justice of the Peace of this township

8
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:42,428
to be joined together
in the bounds of holy matrimony.

9
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:52,813
- Man, it sure is hot
- Hot? You call this hot?

10
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:00,863
Well, I'll be...
I thouht I saw Ben Miller.

11
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:04,117
- He's down Texas somewhere.
- I know.

12
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:08,330
Looked Like Pierce and Colby, too.
Oh, it couldn't be.

13
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:31,104
My goodness gracious

14
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:42,282
- Noon train on time?
- Yes, sir. That is, I think so, sir.

15
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:46,578
Don't know reason why
it shouldn't be...Mr Pierce.

16
00:05:46,828 --> 00:05:52,084
How're you,
Mr Miller...Mr Pierce...Mr Colby?

17
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:30,207
Do you, Will Kane, take Amy
to be your lawful wedded wife

18
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:34,670
to have and to hold from this day forward
until death do you part?

19
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,214
I do.

20
00:06:36,421 --> 00:06:39,550
Do you Amy take Will
to be your lawful wedded husband

21
00:06:39,717 --> 00:06:44,305
to have and to hold from this day forward
until death do you part?

22
00:06:44,514 --> 00:06:47,767
- I do.
- The ring, please.

23
00:06:54,523 --> 00:06:58,404
Then by the authority invested in me
by the laws of this territory,

24
00:06:58,528 --> 00:07:02,532
I pronounce you man and wife.

25
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:13,128
I can't speak for the rest of you,
but I claim an ancient privilege.

26
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:23,137
Moving mighty fast for a Sunday.

27
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:29,852
- Will'
- All those people...

28
00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:34,566
Amy, people ought to be alone
when they get married.

29
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:36,818
I know.

30
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:40,863
I'm gonna try, Amy. I'll do my best.

31
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:43,618
I will too.

32
00:07:49,832 --> 00:07:52,835
Honeymoon is officially over.
Come on, everybody.

33
00:07:53,043 --> 00:07:57,298
- Don't look so shocked.
- No privacy on his wedding day.

34
00:07:57,465 --> 00:08:02,763
Well, one more ceremony,
and Will's a free man, more or less.

35
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:05,139
Marshal, turn in your badge.

36
00:08:05,307 --> 00:08:08,851
I hate to do this
without your new marshal being here.

37
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:13,189
Fuller, Haland I are the entire board
of selectmen in this community.

38
00:08:13,482 --> 00:08:15,567
We're also your very good friends.

39
00:08:15,774 --> 00:08:20,321
With the fine job you've done I feel free
to say, and the judge will bail me out,

40
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:24,034
this town will be safe 'til tomorrow.

41
00:08:24,284 --> 00:08:28,663
You win. But don't marry a Quaker,
she'll have you running a store.

42
00:08:28,873 --> 00:08:31,917
- I can't picture you doing that, Will
- I can.

43
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:35,003
So can I, and a good thing, too.

44
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:37,089
Thank you.

45
00:08:37,256 --> 00:08:40,301
You didn't talk that way
when you wore a star.

46
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:45,180
All right, it's coming off.
But I gotta to be paid first.

47
00:08:47,307 --> 00:08:50,729
- Let me down!
- Not until you kiss me.

48
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:54,274
Will, let me down, you fool!

49
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,708
- You should have been a lawyer.
- I was meant to be a storekeeper.

50
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,669
Marshal, a telegram for you.

51
00:09:15,045 --> 00:09:17,799
It's terrible, it's shocking.

52
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:23,513
- They've pardoned Frank Miller.
- I don't believe it.

53
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:25,890
We could go too.

54
00:09:26,057 --> 00:09:28,602
- Nice of them to let you know.
- That ain't all.

55
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:31,854
Ben Miller is down the depot
with Pierce and Colby.

56
00:09:32,064 --> 00:09:35,317
- He asked about the noon train.
- The noon train?

57
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:43,951
Well.. You get out of this town.
Get out of this town this very minute.

58
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:49,122
- What is it?
- Never mind that now.

59
00:09:49,373 --> 00:09:54,420
- What is it, Mr Howe?
- Just get out, and everything will be fine.

60
00:09:54,586 --> 00:09:56,756
- We'll take care of everything.
- I ought to stay.

61
00:09:57,006 --> 00:10:00,218
Are you crazy?
Think of Amy.

62
00:10:03,345 --> 00:10:07,350
Goodbye, Amy.
Don't worry, everything will be allright

63
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:29,123
Hm... That's funny.

64
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:35,130
- What?
- Oh, you can't see now.

65
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,759
Kane and his new wife
just took off in a big hurry.

66
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:43,304
- What's so funny?
- I mean, a big hurry.

67
00:10:44,097 --> 00:10:48,726
Hey, you don't suppose
Kane's scared of those three gunnies?

68
00:10:50,937 --> 00:10:54,357
I never saw him whip a horse that way.

69
00:11:06,621 --> 00:11:09,039
- Sam?
- Come in, Helen.

70
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:14,378
Ben Miller is in town.
He has two of the old bunch with him.

71
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:21,093
I guess I'll take a look around.

72
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,351
- Why are you stopping?
- It's no good. I've got go back, Amy.

73
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,729
- Why?
- This is crazy. I haven't got any guns.

74
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,358
- Then let's go on. Hurry.
- No.

75
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,485
That's what I've been thinking.

76
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,406
They're making me run.
I've never run from anybody before.

77
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:24,952
- I don't understand any ofthis.
- I don't have time to tell you.

78
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,081
- Then don't go back, Will
- I've got to. That's the whole thing.

79
00:13:31,229 --> 00:13:32,939
Kane's back!

80
00:13:33,231 --> 00:13:35,568
- Don't believe it.
- Just seen him!

81
00:13:38,821 --> 00:13:40,906
- How many coffins have we got?
- Two.

82
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:43,242
We'll need at least two more,
no matter how you figure it.

83
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:45,494
You better get busy, Fred.

84
00:13:48,038 --> 00:13:53,169
Please, Will, if you'd just tell me
what this is all about.

85
00:13:53,377 --> 00:13:57,256
I sent a man up five years ago for murder.
He was supposed to hang.

86
00:13:57,507 --> 00:14:01,886
But up north, they commuted it to life
and now he's free.

87
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:04,514
I don't know how.
It looks like he's coming back.

88
00:14:04,764 --> 00:14:06,891
- I still don't understand.
- He's a...

89
00:14:07,101 --> 00:14:12,064
He was always wild and kind of crazy.
He'll probably make trouble.

90
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:15,484
But that's no concern of yours.
Not any more.

91
00:14:15,692 --> 00:14:17,778
I'm the one who sent him up.

92
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:22,659
But that was part of your job.
They've got a new marshal

93
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:27,831
He won't be here until tomorrow.
Seems to me I've got to stay.

94
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:32,252
- I'm the same man with or without this.
- That isn't so.

95
00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:36,047
He'll come looking for me.
Three of his old bunch are waiting for him.

96
00:14:36,214 --> 00:14:39,885
- That's why we ought to go.
- They'll just come after us.

97
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:44,180
Four of them...
And we'd be all alone in the prairie.

98
00:14:44,848 --> 00:14:46,683
- We've got an hour.
- What's an hour?

99
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,228
We'd never be able to keep that store, Amy.

100
00:14:50,437 --> 00:14:53,023
We'd have to run again
as long as we live.

101
00:14:53,231 --> 00:14:56,985
No, you wouldn't.
Not, if they didn't know where to find us.

102
00:14:58,571 --> 00:15:02,617
- I'm begging you, please, let's go.
- I can't.

103
00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:06,579
Don't try to be a hero.
You don't have to be a hero, not for me.

104
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:10,499
I'm not not trying to be a hero.
If you think I like this, you're crazy.

105
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:14,087
Look, Amy. This is my town.
I've got friends here.

106
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:18,758
I'll swear in deputies, and with a posse
behind me, maybe there won't be trouble.

107
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:23,305
- You know there'll be trouble.
- Then, it's better to have it here.

108
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:30,771
I'm sorry, honey.
I know how you feel about it.

109
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:35,401
- Do you?
- Of course I do. It's against your religion.

110
00:15:35,609 --> 00:15:40,406
- Sure I know how you feel
- But you're doing it just the same.

111
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:45,203
Oh, Will..
We were married just a few minutes ago.

112
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:49,708
We've got our whole lives ahead of us.
Doesn't that mean anything?

113
00:15:49,874 --> 00:15:53,420
You know I've only got an hour,
and I've got lots to do.

114
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,964
Stay at the hotel until it's over.

115
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,467
No, I won't be here when it's over.

116
00:15:58,674 --> 00:16:02,345
You're asking me to wait an hour to find out
if I'll be a wife or a widow.

117
00:16:02,512 --> 00:16:05,765
- It's too long to wait. I won't do it.
- Amy...

118
00:16:05,974 --> 00:16:10,354
If you won't go with me now,
I'll be on that train when it leaves here.

119
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,774
I've got to stay.

120
00:16:37,006 --> 00:16:40,302
- Glad you got hero, Percy.
- Are you?

121
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:56,694
Have you forgotten
that I passed sentence on Frank Miller?

122
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,488
You shouldn't have come back, Will

123
00:16:59,655 --> 00:17:03,368
I figured I had to. I figured I had to stay.

124
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:07,580
- You figured wrong.
- I can deputise a posse, 10-12 guns.

125
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:11,793
- My intuition tells me otherwise.
- Why?

126
00:17:13,545 --> 00:17:16,964
No time for a lesson in civics, my boy.

127
00:17:17,174 --> 00:17:19,426
In the 5th century BC
the citizens of Athens,

128
00:17:19,592 --> 00:17:23,221
having suffered under a tyrant,
managed to banish him.

129
00:17:23,431 --> 00:17:26,809
When he returned years later
with an army of mercenary,

130
00:17:26,976 --> 00:17:30,771
those same citizens
not only opened their gates for him,

131
00:17:30,938 --> 00:17:35,401
but stood by while he executed
members of the League of Government.

132
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:41,574
Similar thing happened eight years ago
in a town called Indian Falls.

133
00:17:41,824 --> 00:17:47,747
I escaped death only through the intercess on
of a lady of somewhat dubious reputation,

134
00:17:47,913 --> 00:17:52,127
and the cost of a handsome ring
which once belonged to my mother.

135
00:17:52,294 --> 00:17:54,379
Unfortunately, I have no more rings.

136
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:59,175
- You're a judge.
- Been a judge many times and many towns.

137
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:04,765
- I hope to live to be a judge again.
- I can't tell you what to do.

138
00:18:05,056 --> 00:18:11,021
Why must you be so stupid? Have you forgotten
what he's done? That he's crazy?

139
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,440
Don't you rememher
when he sat there and said:

140
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:19,113
''You'll never hang me. I'll come back
I swear it. I'll kill you, Kane!''

141
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:28,665
Here you are, ma'am.
This will take you to St. Louis.

142
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:31,458
Thank you.

143
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:41,094
Maybe you'd rather wait somewhere else.
Like at the hotel, maybe.

144
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:44,514
- All right thank you.
- I'm sorry about all this, Mrs Kane.

145
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:48,018
Don't you worry.
The marshal'll take care of himself.

146
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,687
Thank you very much.

147
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,815
Hey, that wasn't here five years ago.

148
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:58,487
- So what?
- Nothing...yet.

149
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:08,080
Harvey, don't you think
Kane will be looking for you right now?

150
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:12,168
- You're really sore at him.
- Wouldn't you be if you wore me?

151
00:19:12,877 --> 00:19:16,089
I suppose...if I wore you.

152
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:26,350
I'll be back in a while.

153
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:49,541
- Goodbye, Will
- Goodbye.

154
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:53,002
- You think I'm letting you down?
- No.

155
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:57,382
Look, this is just a dirty little village
in the middle of nowhere.

156
00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:00,803
Nothing that happens here
is really important. Get out.

157
00:20:01,011 --> 00:20:03,764
There isn't time.

158
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,016
What a waste. Good luck.

159
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:20,781
Johnny!

160
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:26,537
- Why ain't you in church?
- Why ain't you?

161
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:28,080
Will you do somethin' for me?

162
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:31,960
Go find Anderson, Howe and Fuller,
and tell them I want them here.

163
00:20:32,168 --> 00:20:35,797
- Then find Harv Pell!
- Don't have to do that. I'm right here.

164
00:20:35,964 --> 00:20:39,008
- Where have you been?
- Busy.

165
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:41,720
You know what's doing?
We've got lots to do.

166
00:20:41,928 --> 00:20:45,723
Hold up a second.
This ain't really your job, you know.

167
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:49,853
- That's what everybody keeps telling me.
- Just listen a second.

168
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:54,275
- All right, I'm listening.
- This is the way I see it.

169
00:20:54,524 --> 00:20:59,739
If you'd gone with the new marshal
not due till tomorrow, I'd be in charge, right?

170
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:04,285
If I'm good enough to hold down the job
when there's trouble,

171
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:06,788
how come the city fathers
didn't trust me with it permanently?

172
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:09,458
- I don't know.
- Don't you?

173
00:21:09,665 --> 00:21:13,753
- No.
- I figure you carry a lot of weight.

174
00:21:13,963 --> 00:21:17,632
Maybe they didn't ask me.
Maybe they figured you were too young.

175
00:21:17,883 --> 00:21:21,553
- You think I'm too young too?
- You sure act like it sometimes. Come on.

176
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:36,485
It's very simple, Will You just tell
the old boys that I'm the new marshal.

177
00:21:36,652 --> 00:21:40,322
Tomorrow they can tell the other fellow
that the job's filled.

178
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:44,035
- You really mean it, don't you?
- Sure.

179
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:48,789
- But I can't do it.
- Why not?

180
00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:52,544
- If you don't know, it's no use me tellin' you.
- You mean you won't do it?

181
00:21:52,752 --> 00:21:55,256
- Have it your way.
- All right

182
00:21:55,421 --> 00:21:59,760
The truth is, you probably
talked against me from the start.

183
00:21:59,926 --> 00:22:04,140
You've been sore about me
and Helen Ramirez right along, ain't you?

184
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:07,476
You and Helen Ramirez? I...

185
00:22:07,685 --> 00:22:12,397
I didn't know and it doesn't mean
anything to me, you ought to know that.

186
00:22:12,689 --> 00:22:14,692
Yeah, you've been washed up
for more than a year.

187
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,572
You get married, only, you can't stand
anybody taking your place there...

188
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,617
- ...especially me.
- You're...

189
00:22:28,622 --> 00:22:33,545
- I haven't got time, Harv.
- Okay, let's get down to business.

190
00:22:33,837 --> 00:22:36,090
You want me to stick,
you put a word in for me.

191
00:22:36,297 --> 00:22:40,635
Sure I want you to stick, but I'm not buying it.
It's gotta be up to you.

192
00:23:15,838 --> 00:23:18,550
I thought you'd grown up by now.

193
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,888
I thought your disposition might've
sweetened up a little down in Abeline.

194
00:23:23,054 --> 00:23:25,641
I guess we're both wrong.

195
00:23:32,606 --> 00:23:34,776
What's so funny?

196
00:23:35,026 --> 00:23:37,361
Did you really think
you could put that over on Kane?

197
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,782
- Why not?
- When are you going to grow up?

198
00:23:40,949 --> 00:23:43,409
- I'm getting tired of that kind of talk.
- Then grow up.

199
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,037
Cut it out!

200
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:53,044
- All right
- Why should he have gone for it?

201
00:23:53,294 --> 00:23:56,090
He needs me plenty
when Frank Miller gets here.

202
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,717
- That's possible.
- He should've had me made marshal.

203
00:23:58,926 --> 00:24:02,722
- He's just sore. Sore about you and me.
- Is he?

204
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:04,180
Sure.

205
00:24:04,348 --> 00:24:07,434
- You told him?
- Sure.

206
00:24:07,685 --> 00:24:09,978
You're a fool.

207
00:24:10,896 --> 00:24:13,899
Why? Didn't you want him to know?

208
00:24:15,484 --> 00:24:20,572
Hey... Who did the walking out anyway,
you or him?

209
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:26,829
Get out, Harvey.

210
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,666
- I might just do that.
- Then do it!

211
00:24:31,876 --> 00:24:34,420
- You don't mean that.
- Try me.

212
00:24:35,755 --> 00:24:38,258
You're gonna talk different
when Frank gets here.

213
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:41,345
You might want somebody around,
when you try to explain about Kane.

214
00:24:41,553 --> 00:24:44,265
- I can take care of myself.
- Sure.

215
00:24:44,432 --> 00:24:50,103
I've heard that you might not be so pretty
when he gets through with you.

216
00:24:52,315 --> 00:24:55,693
- I won't be back.
- Good.

217
00:25:06,663 --> 00:25:08,665
Come in.

218
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:15,798
- I just saw Harvey. Is everything allright?
- I think I have to talk with Mr Weaver.

219
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:19,843
- You're getting out?
- Yes.

220
00:25:20,093 --> 00:25:23,014
You want me to give Kane a hand?

221
00:25:28,478 --> 00:25:31,356
- No.
- All right

222
00:25:41,616 --> 00:25:45,245
May I wait here for the noon train?

223
00:25:46,997 --> 00:25:49,791
I said, may I wait in the lobby until noon?

224
00:25:51,168 --> 00:25:54,462
- Sure, lady.
- Thank you.

225
00:25:56,215 --> 00:25:59,509
- You're Mrs Kane, ain't you?
- Yes.

226
00:25:59,676 --> 00:26:03,597
You're leaving on the noon train,
but your husband ain't.

227
00:26:04,265 --> 00:26:07,643
- No, why?
- No reason, but it's mighty interesting.

228
00:26:08,644 --> 00:26:12,815
Now me, I wouldn't leave this town at noon
for all the tea in China.

229
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:16,318
No, sir.
It's going to be quite a sight to see.

230
00:27:16,506 --> 00:27:19,301
- Will, I just heard...
- Hello.

231
00:27:19,469 --> 00:27:22,179
You can count on me,
you know that, don't you?

232
00:27:22,387 --> 00:27:25,141
- I was figuring I could.
- You cleaned this town up.

233
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:27,351
You made it fit
for women and kids to live in.

234
00:27:27,601 --> 00:27:29,729
Miller or nobody else'll never
drag it down again.

235
00:27:29,979 --> 00:27:33,608
- I hoped people'd feel that way.
- What other way is there?

236
00:27:33,858 --> 00:27:38,154
- How many men you got Lined up?
- None yet.

237
00:27:40,573 --> 00:27:45,953
Well, you better get going, man.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

238
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:23,159
- Where is he?
- He's coming up the back way. A careful man.

239
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:32,085
Come in, Mr Weaver. Hello.
Sit down, please.

240
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:39,217
Is there anything wrong, Mrs Ramirez?
Why did you send for me?

241
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:41,803
I'm leaving town.
I want to sell the store.

242
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:45,432
- You want to buy me out?
- How much did you want?

243
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:48,353
Two thousand. I think that's fair.

244
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,980
It's fair allright, but
I couldn't raise that much now.

245
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:56,027
- How much can you raise?
- Oh... 1000 dollars.

246
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:01,658
All right you can pay Sam the rest
in six months.

247
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,870
- He'll get it to me. A deal?
- Yes, ma'am.

248
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:09,250
All right, Mr Weaver. Thank you.

249
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:15,756
Mrs Ramirez, I want to
thank you for everything, I mean...

250
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:20,178
When you first put the deal to me
about staking me in the store,

251
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:24,140
and being a silent partner,
you know, my wife thought..

252
00:29:26,142 --> 00:29:32,023
Err... What I really mean to say is that
you've been real decent to me right along,

253
00:29:32,273 --> 00:29:34,191
and I want you to know
that I've been honest with you.

254
00:29:34,358 --> 00:29:37,028
I know you have, MrWeaver.
Goodbye.

255
00:29:37,237 --> 00:29:41,407
Goodbye, Mrs Ramirez.
And good luck to you.

256
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,010
- Will..
- Amy. You've changed your mind.

257
00:30:01,344 --> 00:30:04,640
I thought you'd changed yours.

258
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:09,062
No, Will, I have my ticket.

259
00:30:12,482 --> 00:30:14,526
I see.

260
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,073
Clean number 19.
Mrs Miller is very particular.

261
00:30:19,322 --> 00:30:22,910
- Is Helen Ramirez in?
- I guess so.

262
00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:26,747
Think you can find it allright?

263
00:30:35,422 --> 00:30:37,716
Come in.

264
00:30:48,811 --> 00:30:52,190
What are you looking at?
You think I have changed?

265
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:59,698
What do you want?
You want me to help you?

266
00:30:59,865 --> 00:31:03,117
You want me to ask Frank to let you go?
Beg for you?

267
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:06,623
I would not do it.
I would not lift a finger for you.

268
00:31:08,081 --> 00:31:11,711
I came to tell you he was coming.
I should've figured you know about it.

269
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,462
I know about it.

270
00:31:13,629 --> 00:31:18,216
You ought to get out of town
or I might not be able to...well..

271
00:31:18,426 --> 00:31:21,387
- Anything can happen.
- I'm not afraid of him.

272
00:31:21,637 --> 00:31:26,393
I know you're not
but you...you know how he is.

273
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:29,729
I know how he is.

274
00:31:31,564 --> 00:31:34,484
Maybe he doesn't know.

275
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:38,530
- He's probably got letters.
- What about it?

276
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:46,163
Nothing in life is free.
I'm getting out. I'm packing now.

277
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,373
That's good.

278
00:32:03,764 --> 00:32:06,393
- Goodbye, Helen.
- Kane...

279
00:32:07,434 --> 00:32:10,688
If you're smart, you will get out, too.

280
00:32:12,315 --> 00:32:14,692
- I can't.
- I know.

281
00:32:45,224 --> 00:32:48,978
- May I ask you something?
- Sure.

282
00:32:49,145 --> 00:32:52,440
- Who is Miss Ramirez?
- Mrs Ramirez?

283
00:32:53,608 --> 00:32:56,528
She used to be a friend of your husband's
a while back.

284
00:32:56,735 --> 00:33:00,115
Before that she was a friend of Frank Miller's.

285
00:33:00,323 --> 00:33:03,493
I see. Thank you.

286
00:33:05,621 --> 00:33:08,666
- You don't Like my husband, do you?
- No.

287
00:33:08,832 --> 00:33:11,501
- Why?
- Lots of reasons.

288
00:33:11,711 --> 00:33:15,297
This place was always busy
when Frank Miller was around.

289
00:33:15,506 --> 00:33:16,882
I'm not the only one.

290
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:20,678
A plenty of people think
he's got a comeuppance coming.

291
00:33:20,845 --> 00:33:24,098
You asked me, ma'am, so I'm telling you.

292
00:33:46,204 --> 00:33:49,542
- I'll go and get some liquor.
- You have to have it?

293
00:33:49,749 --> 00:33:51,752
- Yeah.
- If you're going after that...

294
00:33:52,002 --> 00:33:55,757
- I said I was going for liquor.
- Keep away from Kane.

295
00:33:56,006 --> 00:33:57,674
Sure.

296
00:34:26,121 --> 00:34:29,583
Hello, Harv. Where's the tin star?

297
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:34,171
- I turned it in and quit.
- Smart move.

298
00:34:35,422 --> 00:34:37,842
I didn't ask for your opinion.

299
00:35:05,037 --> 00:35:07,665
Hey, Ben! How are you?

300
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:11,836
Hey, look who's here!

301
00:35:12,795 --> 00:35:15,339
- How are you, Ben?
- Give me a bottle.

302
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,305
- It's been a long time, Ben.
- Yeah.

303
00:35:23,514 --> 00:35:25,392
Yes, sir. How's Frank?

304
00:35:27,143 --> 00:35:32,149
- He's not complaining.
- It'll be a hot time in the old town tonight, eh?

305
00:35:35,068 --> 00:35:36,570
I wouldn't be surprised.

306
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:33,504
Kane's dead by minutes after
Frank gets off the train.

307
00:36:33,712 --> 00:36:37,258
- It's not much time.
- That's all Frank'll need, because...

308
00:36:51,523 --> 00:36:56,236
You carry a badge and a gun, marshal
You ain't no call to do that.

309
00:36:58,656 --> 00:37:00,825
You're right

310
00:37:02,743 --> 00:37:04,828
No.

311
00:37:14,171 --> 00:37:16,131
I guess you all know why I am here.

312
00:37:16,341 --> 00:37:20,470
I need deputies. I take all I can get.

313
00:37:23,848 --> 00:37:26,726
You must be crazy comin' in here
to raise a posse.

314
00:37:26,893 --> 00:37:30,230
Frank's got friends in this room.
You ought to know that.

315
00:37:32,107 --> 00:37:37,279
Some of you wore special deputies when we
broke this bunch. I need you again...now.

316
00:37:39,406 --> 00:37:43,994
Things wore different then.
You had six steady deputies to start off with.

317
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:48,165
Every one a top gun.
You ain't got but two now.

318
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:52,294
You ain't got two.
Harv Pell says he just quit. Why?

319
00:37:55,756 --> 00:37:57,383
That's between the two of us.

320
00:37:57,592 --> 00:38:01,262
You're asking an awful lot,
considering the kind of man Frank is.

321
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:05,015
All right
We all know what Miller's like.

322
00:38:05,225 --> 00:38:07,811
That's why I'm here. How about it?

323
00:39:17,592 --> 00:39:20,386
Mildred, he's coming.
Now you do like I told you.

324
00:39:20,553 --> 00:39:23,390
I'm not home.
No matter what he says, I'm not home.

325
00:39:23,598 --> 00:39:26,935
- Sam, he's your friend.
- Don't argue with me. He'll be here soon.

326
00:39:27,144 --> 00:39:29,271
He won't believe me. He'll know I'm lying.

327
00:39:29,562 --> 00:39:32,274
You do like I tell you.

328
00:39:47,874 --> 00:39:52,628
- Hello, Mrs Fuller. Is Sam in?
- No, he isn't.

329
00:39:54,755 --> 00:39:58,217
Do you know where he is?
It's important to me, to find him.

330
00:39:58,384 --> 00:40:02,847
I think... He's in church, Will.
He's gone to church.

331
00:40:04,974 --> 00:40:08,896
- Without you?
- I'm gonna go as soon as I dress.

332
00:40:14,735 --> 00:40:18,114
Thank you, Mrs Fuller. Goodbye.

333
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,100
What do you want?
Do you want me to get killed?

334
00:40:45,225 --> 00:40:49,772
- Do you want to be a widow?
- No, Sam. No.

335
00:40:50,564 --> 00:40:52,816
Kane!

336
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:58,363
- What's the matter, Jimmy?
- Nothin'. I've been lookin' for you.

337
00:40:58,614 --> 00:41:02,284
I wanna a gun. I wanna be with you
when that train comes in.

338
00:41:03,078 --> 00:41:07,832
- Can...can you handle a gun?
- Sure I can. I used to be good.

339
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:10,668
Honest. It ain't just gettin' even.

340
00:41:10,876 --> 00:41:14,839
It's a chance. This is what I need.
Please, let me get in on this.

341
00:41:15,799 --> 00:41:19,470
All right, Jimmy.
I'll call you if I need you.

342
00:41:19,635 --> 00:41:21,972
Get yourself a drink meanwhile.

343
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,860
Come in, Sam.

344
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,786
You're leavin' town?

345
00:41:44,953 --> 00:41:48,456
- Where are you going?
- I don't know yet.

346
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:51,377
That doesn't make much sense.

347
00:41:54,005 --> 00:41:58,217
- You're afraid, huh? Afraid of Miller.
- No.

348
00:41:58,426 --> 00:42:00,553
Sure you are.
You wouldn't be runnin'.

349
00:42:00,721 --> 00:42:03,849
You don't have to worry
as long as I'm around, you know that.

350
00:42:04,099 --> 00:42:08,144
- I'll take Milleron any time.
- I believe you.

351
00:42:08,312 --> 00:42:12,149
Then why are you goin'?
You're cuttin' out with Kane.

352
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:13,942
- Oh, Harvey...
- Why are you goin'?

353
00:42:14,152 --> 00:42:16,362
- What difference does it make?
- I know it's Kane!

354
00:42:16,611 --> 00:42:21,867
It isn't Kane. I'm going to tell you something
about you and your friend Kane.

355
00:42:22,034 --> 00:42:25,204
You're a good-looking boy,
you have big broad shoulders.

356
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:27,080
But he is a man.

357
00:42:27,331 --> 00:42:30,001
It takes more than broad shoulders
to make a man, Harvey,

358
00:42:30,209 --> 00:42:32,419
and you have a long way to go.

359
00:42:34,254 --> 00:42:37,383
You know something?
I don't think you'll ever make it.

360
00:42:39,594 --> 00:42:41,846
Let me tell you something.
You're not goin' anywhere.

361
00:42:42,097 --> 00:42:45,767
You're stayin' with me.
It's gonna be just like it was before.

362
00:42:50,397 --> 00:42:53,191
You want to know why I'm leaving?
Then listen.

363
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,697
Kane will be dead in half an hour.
And nobody's going to do anything about it.

364
00:42:57,947 --> 00:43:02,118
And when he dies, this town dies too.
I can feel it.

365
00:43:02,284 --> 00:43:05,787
I'm all alone in the world,
I have to make a living.

366
00:43:05,997 --> 00:43:09,000
So I'm going someplace else,
that's all.

367
00:43:12,419 --> 00:43:17,175
And as for you, I don't like anybody to put
his hands on me unless I want him to.

368
00:43:17,383 --> 00:43:20,220
And I don't like you to...anymore.

369
00:43:36,903 --> 00:43:40,658
Our text today
is from Malachi, chapter four.

370
00:43:40,866 --> 00:43:47,707
''For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn
as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all..''

371
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,547
Yes?

372
00:43:54,756 --> 00:43:58,052
I'm sorry, parson,
I don't want to disturb the services...

373
00:43:58,259 --> 00:44:02,848
You already have. You don't
come to this church very often, marshal,

374
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:06,309
and today
you didn't see fit to be married here.

375
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:10,188
What can be so important
to bring you here now?

376
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,733
I need help.

377
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:21,075
It's true, I haven't been a churchgoing man,
and maybe that's a bad thing.

378
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:25,287
I didn't get married here today
because my wife is a Quaker,

379
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:29,375
but I came here for help
because there are people here.

380
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:35,005
I'm sorry, marshal
Say what you have to say.

381
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:40,554
Maybe some of you already know it
but if you don't...

382
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,723
It looks like Frank Miller
is coming back on a noon train.

383
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:50,856
I need all the specialdeputies I can get.

384
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:58,280
Well, what are we waiting for?

385
00:44:59,949 --> 00:45:01,950
Let's go.

386
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:05,163
Hold it a minute, hold it!

387
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:08,165
Before we rush out into something
that isn't so pleasant,

388
00:45:08,374 --> 00:45:11,168
let's make sure we know
what this is all about.

389
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:17,008
ain't it true
that Kane ain't no longer a marshal?

390
00:45:18,427 --> 00:45:21,972
And that there's personal trouble
with Kane and Miller?

391
00:45:26,768 --> 00:45:30,397
All right, allright!
Quiet, everybody!

392
00:45:30,606 --> 00:45:33,526
If there's a difference of opinion,
let everybody have a say.

393
00:45:33,775 --> 00:45:37,988
But let's do it like grown-up people,
and get the kids out of the building.

394
00:46:10,147 --> 00:46:14,067
- Anything on the train?
- It's on time as far as I know, sir.

395
00:46:19,031 --> 00:46:23,535
It don't really matter if there's anything
personal between Miller and Kane.

396
00:46:23,745 --> 00:46:26,330
We all know who Miller is,
and what Miller is.

397
00:46:26,496 --> 00:46:31,336
- We're wasting time.
- All right Coy!

398
00:46:32,003 --> 00:46:35,673
We all know who Miller is
and we put him away once.

399
00:46:35,924 --> 00:46:39,219
And who saved him from hanging?
The politicians up north.

400
00:46:39,427 --> 00:46:43,014
I say, this is their mess.
Let them take care of it.

401
00:46:43,223 --> 00:46:45,518
- Fryer?
- Well, I say this:

402
00:46:45,725 --> 00:46:48,938
We've been paying good money
for a marshal and deputies.

403
00:46:49,187 --> 00:46:52,941
The first time there's any trouble,
we're supposed to take care of it ourselves.

404
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:55,111
What have we been paying for
all this time?

405
00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:58,656
We're not peace officers,
and this ain't our job!

406
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:02,786
I've been saying right along,
we ought to have more deputies.

407
00:47:02,993 --> 00:47:06,664
If we did, we wouldn't be facing this now.

408
00:47:06,831 --> 00:47:10,501
Just a minute, just a minute!
Everybody, quiet!

409
00:47:10,669 --> 00:47:13,421
Keep it orderly.
You had your hand up.

410
00:47:14,422 --> 00:47:16,841
I can't believe I've heard
some of the things said here.

411
00:47:17,051 --> 00:47:18,802
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

412
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:22,305
We paid this man,
and he was the best marshal we ever had.

413
00:47:22,514 --> 00:47:24,642
It ain't his trouble, it's ours.

414
00:47:24,849 --> 00:47:27,852
If we don't do what's right,
we're gonna have more trouble.

415
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,982
There ain't but one thing to do,
and you all know what that is.

416
00:47:32,191 --> 00:47:35,528
- Go ahead, Kibbee.
- This thing has been handled wrong.

417
00:47:35,736 --> 00:47:38,656
Those three killers
walking the streets bold as brass...

418
00:47:38,865 --> 00:47:42,368
Why didn't you put them in jail
where they ought to be?

419
00:47:42,576 --> 00:47:45,120
Then we'd only have Miller to worry about.

420
00:47:45,331 --> 00:47:49,333
I haven't anything to arrest them for.
They haven't done anything.

421
00:47:49,542 --> 00:47:52,211
There's no law against them
sitting on a bench at the depot.

422
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:57,133
I can't listen to any more of this.
What's the matter with you people?

423
00:47:57,342 --> 00:48:01,305
Remember when a decent woman
couldn't walk down the street in broad daylight?

424
00:48:01,513 --> 00:48:04,724
When this wasn't a fit place
to bring up a child?

425
00:48:04,976 --> 00:48:08,604
How can you sit and talk, and talk,
and talk like this?

426
00:48:08,812 --> 00:48:13,191
What are we getting so excited about?
How do we know Miller's on that train?

427
00:48:13,984 --> 00:48:18,781
We can be pretty sure he's on it.
Time's getting short.

428
00:48:20,116 --> 00:48:24,495
- Parson, you got anything to say?
- I don't know.

429
00:48:24,704 --> 00:48:27,415
The commandment says
''thou shalt not kill''

430
00:48:27,666 --> 00:48:30,293
but we hire men to do it for us.

431
00:48:30,501 --> 00:48:33,713
The right and the wrong
seem pretty clear here,

432
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,550
but if I should tell my people
to go out and kill,

433
00:48:36,758 --> 00:48:43,890
and maybe get themselves killed, I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.

434
00:48:44,683 --> 00:48:47,019
All right, I'll say this.

435
00:48:47,186 --> 00:48:52,232
What this town owes Will Kane, it can never
pay with money. Don't forget it.

436
00:48:52,441 --> 00:48:56,279
He's the best marshal we've ever had,
and maybe the best we'll ever have.

437
00:48:56,445 --> 00:49:01,034
So if Miller comes back here today,
it's our problem, not his.

438
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,162
It's our problem
because this is our town.

439
00:49:04,412 --> 00:49:06,664
We made it with our own hands,
out of nothing.

440
00:49:06,832 --> 00:49:11,169
If we want to keep it decent
we gotta think mighty clear today.

441
00:49:11,377 --> 00:49:15,840
We gotta have the courage to do what is right,
no matter how hard it is.

442
00:49:16,007 --> 00:49:20,721
All right! There's gonna be fighting
when Kane and Miller meet.

443
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:24,100
And somebody's going to get hurt,
that's for sure.

444
00:49:24,307 --> 00:49:28,938
Now... People up north
are thinking about this town.

445
00:49:29,146 --> 00:49:35,318
Thinking about sending money down here,
to put up stores and factories.

446
00:49:35,528 --> 00:49:38,823
It would mean a lot to this town, an awful lot,

447
00:49:39,031 --> 00:49:44,996
but if they'll read about shooting in the streets,
what are they going to think?

448
00:49:45,204 --> 00:49:49,959
I'll tell you. They'll think
this is just another wide-open town,

449
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:52,796
and everything we worked for
will be wiped out.

450
00:49:52,963 --> 00:49:57,925
In one day, this town
will be sat back five years,

451
00:49:58,093 --> 00:50:00,762
and I don't think we can let that happen.

452
00:50:00,929 --> 00:50:04,641
Mind you, you all know
how I feel about this man.

453
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:09,980
He's a mighty brave man, a good man.
He didn't have to come back today.

454
00:50:10,856 --> 00:50:15,903
And for his sake, and a sake of this town,
I wish he hadn't.

455
00:50:16,152 --> 00:50:18,364
Because if he's not here when Miller comes,

456
00:50:18,572 --> 00:50:21,743
my hunch is,
there won't be any trouble, not one bit.

457
00:50:21,909 --> 00:50:26,873
Tomorrow we'll have a new marshal
and if we offer him our services,

458
00:50:26,998 --> 00:50:29,209
I think we can handle anything
that comes along.

459
00:50:30,335 --> 00:50:35,006
To me that makes sense.
To me that's the only way out of this.

460
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,013
Will, I think you better go
while there's still time.

461
00:50:42,597 --> 00:50:45,768
It's better for you and...it's better for us.

462
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:57,446
Thanks.

463
00:51:27,811 --> 00:51:30,147
Why don't you put that thing away?

464
00:51:45,538 --> 00:51:48,834
- Bang, bang, bang!
- You're dead, Kane.

465
00:52:26,999 --> 00:52:30,168
I just sent the kid to find you.
Didn't he come?

466
00:52:30,334 --> 00:52:32,962
He was here.

467
00:52:35,298 --> 00:52:38,218
You've been my friend all my life.
You got me this job.

468
00:52:38,385 --> 00:52:41,054
You made them send for me.

469
00:52:41,305 --> 00:52:44,599
Ever since I was a kid
I wanted to be like you, Mart.

470
00:52:44,809 --> 00:52:50,648
- You've been a law man all your life.
- Yeah, all my life. It's a great life.

471
00:52:50,856 --> 00:52:53,817
You risk your skin catching killers,
and the juries turn them loose,

472
00:52:53,985 --> 00:52:56,654
so they can come back
and shoot at you again.

473
00:52:56,863 --> 00:52:59,574
If you're honest,
you're poor your whole life.

474
00:52:59,783 --> 00:53:03,953
In the end you wind up dying all alone
on some dirty street.

475
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:09,167
For what?
For nothing. For a tin star.

476
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:14,297
The judge's left town, Harvey's quit,
and I'm having trouble getting deputies.

477
00:53:14,507 --> 00:53:17,509
It figures. It's all happened too sudden.

478
00:53:17,801 --> 00:53:22,305
People got to talk themselves into law and order
before they do anything.

479
00:53:22,598 --> 00:53:27,436
Maybe because down deep they don't care.
They just don't care.

480
00:53:33,776 --> 00:53:36,237
What'll I do, Mart?

481
00:53:38,405 --> 00:53:40,949
I was hopin' you wouldn't come back

482
00:53:41,201 --> 00:53:45,664
- You know why I came back
- But not to commit suicide.

483
00:53:45,872 --> 00:53:49,418
Sometimes... Sometimes
prison changes a man.

484
00:53:49,584 --> 00:53:54,465
Not him. This is all planned,
that's why they're all here.

485
00:53:54,672 --> 00:53:57,383
Get out, Will! Get out.

486
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:10,439
Will you come down
to that depot with me?

487
00:54:10,607 --> 00:54:12,899
No.

488
00:54:13,901 --> 00:54:18,322
You know how I feel about you,
but I ain't goin' with you.

489
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:23,036
Seems like a man with busted knuckles
didn't need arthritis, don't it?

490
00:54:23,995 --> 00:54:25,913
No, I couldn't do nothin' for you.

491
00:54:26,206 --> 00:54:30,877
You'd get yourself killed
worryin' about me.

492
00:54:31,087 --> 00:54:33,255
It's too one-sided like it is.

493
00:54:39,553 --> 00:54:42,140
- So long, Martin.
- So long.

494
00:54:43,683 --> 00:54:47,853
It's all for nothin', Will.
It's all for nothin'.

495
00:54:59,074 --> 00:55:03,244
Excuse me, what is
Mrs Ramirez's room number?

496
00:55:04,537 --> 00:55:07,123
- Three.
- Thank you.

497
00:55:24,015 --> 00:55:26,393
Come in.

498
00:55:28,688 --> 00:55:32,984
- Yes?
- Mrs Ramirez? I'm Mrs Kane.

499
00:55:33,192 --> 00:55:35,278
I know.

500
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:39,824
- May I come in?
- If you like.

501
00:55:45,371 --> 00:55:48,333
- Sit down, Mrs Kane.
- No, thank you.

502
00:55:48,542 --> 00:55:50,460
- What do you want?
- Please...

503
00:55:50,669 --> 00:55:53,797
I'm afraid that if I sat down,
I wouldn't be able to get up again.

504
00:55:54,048 --> 00:55:57,051
- Why?
- It wasn't easy for me to come here.

505
00:55:57,259 --> 00:56:00,387
- Why?
- Look, Mrs Ramirez...

506
00:56:00,554 --> 00:56:04,975
Will and I were married an hour ago.
We were ready to leave...

507
00:56:05,142 --> 00:56:07,437
...then this thing happened
and he wouldn't go.

508
00:56:07,603 --> 00:56:12,692
I did everything. I pleaded, I threatened,
I just couldn't reach him.

509
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:17,405
- And now?
- That man downstairs, the clerk..

510
00:56:17,614 --> 00:56:20,325
He said things about you and Will

511
00:56:20,575 --> 00:56:23,077
I've tried to understand
why he wouldn't go with me,

512
00:56:23,328 --> 00:56:26,247
and it's got to be because of you.

513
00:56:26,874 --> 00:56:29,626
- What do you want from me?
- Let him go.

514
00:56:29,793 --> 00:56:31,962
He still has a chance. Let him go.

515
00:56:32,254 --> 00:56:35,674
- I can't help you.
- Please.

516
00:56:35,883 --> 00:56:38,177
He isn't staying for me.

517
00:56:38,385 --> 00:56:42,056
I haven't spoken to him for a year,
until today.

518
00:56:45,142 --> 00:56:49,730
- I'm leaving on the same train you are.
- Then why is he staying?

519
00:56:50,732 --> 00:56:54,402
If you don't know,
I can't explain it to you.

520
00:56:56,655 --> 00:56:59,907
Thank you anyway.
You've been very kind.

521
00:57:02,077 --> 00:57:06,456
What kind of woman are you?
How can you leave him like this?

522
00:57:06,664 --> 00:57:09,209
Does the sound of guns
frighten you that much?

523
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:12,630
No, Mrs Ramirez. I've heard guns.

524
00:57:12,837 --> 00:57:15,799
My father and my brother
were killed by guns.

525
00:57:16,008 --> 00:57:20,263
They were on the right side, but that
didn't help them when the shooting started..

526
00:57:20,429 --> 00:57:24,100
My brother was 19. I watched him die.

527
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:30,273
That's when I became a Quaker.
I don't care who's right or who's wrong.

528
00:57:30,482 --> 00:57:34,360
There's got to be some better way
for people to live.

529
00:57:36,529 --> 00:57:39,699
Will knows how I feel about it.

530
00:57:39,908 --> 00:57:44,120
Just a minute.
Are you going to wait for the train downstairs?

531
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:47,749
- Yes.
- Why don't you wait here?

532
00:58:03,474 --> 00:58:06,769
I've got no use for Kane,
but he's got guts.

533
00:58:07,019 --> 00:58:09,730
You're mighty broadminded, Joe.

534
00:58:13,651 --> 00:58:18,073
I always figured you had guts, but
I never gave you credit for brains until now.

535
00:58:18,281 --> 00:58:21,826
What does that mean?

536
00:58:22,036 --> 00:58:25,080
It takes a smart man
to know when to back away.

537
00:58:27,207 --> 00:58:30,836
If I can't pick my company when I drink,
I ain't coming in here anymore.

538
00:58:32,796 --> 00:58:38,719
Okay... All right
The boy with a tin star.

539
01:00:05,017 --> 01:00:08,812
Put a saddle on him, Kane.
Go on, saddle him up.

540
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:11,274
He'd go a long way before he tires.

541
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:13,818
- You were thinking that.
- Kind of.

542
01:00:13,986 --> 01:00:17,697
- You're scared?
- I guess so.

543
01:00:19,784 --> 01:00:22,160
Sure. Stands to reason.

544
01:00:25,247 --> 01:00:27,916
Come on. Let me help you.

545
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:38,845
Seems like everybody
wants to get me out of town.

546
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:42,181
Nobody wants to see you get killed.

547
01:00:43,432 --> 01:00:45,643
- Where're you going?
- Back to the office, I guess.

548
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:48,771
Oh, no. You're getting on that horse
and getting out.

549
01:00:49,689 --> 01:00:54,235
What's the matter with you?
You were ready to do it yourself.

550
01:00:54,361 --> 01:00:58,073
Look, Harv. I thought about it
because I was tired.

551
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:02,076
You think about a lot of things
when you're tired. I can't do it.

552
01:01:02,244 --> 01:01:05,372
- Why?
- I don't know.

553
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:07,958
Get on that horse, Will!

554
01:01:08,959 --> 01:01:11,671
Why is this so important?
You don't care if I live or die.

555
01:01:12,253 --> 01:01:17,342
- Come on.
- Don't shove me. I'm tired of being shoved.

556
01:03:01,993 --> 01:03:06,165
I hate this town.
I've always hated it.

557
01:03:06,332 --> 01:03:09,501
To be a Mexican woman
in a town Like this...

558
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:13,881
- I understand.
- You do?

559
01:03:14,089 --> 01:03:19,178
That's good. I don't understand you,
no matter what you say.

560
01:03:19,344 --> 01:03:23,015
If Kane was my man,
I'd never leave him. I'd get a gun.

561
01:03:23,183 --> 01:03:25,476
- I'd fight
- Why don't you?

562
01:03:27,311 --> 01:03:30,023
He's not my man. He's yours.

563
01:03:50,043 --> 01:03:55,550
- You have some clean water?
- Why, sure, marshal sit down.

564
01:04:03,516 --> 01:04:07,728
- Running some kind of trouble?
- No, not trouble.

565
01:04:11,858 --> 01:04:15,070
- What're you building?
- Just fixing things.

566
01:04:15,278 --> 01:04:18,573
Now, take it easy. Settle back, that's it.

567
01:04:21,534 --> 01:04:25,832
Fred, Fred! Hold it awhile.
Stop 'til I tell you to start again.

568
01:04:45,142 --> 01:04:47,604
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, marshal

569
01:04:47,812 --> 01:04:51,942
- Oh, no...
- Tell your man he can go back to work now.

570
01:05:16,967 --> 01:05:20,388
- Will!
- I guess I forgot about you, Herb.

571
01:05:20,555 --> 01:05:25,185
- I'm sure glad you're here.
- Time's getting pretty short.

572
01:05:25,352 --> 01:05:28,188
- Sure is.
- When are the other boys coming?

573
01:05:28,354 --> 01:05:30,732
- We gotta make plans.
- The other boys?

574
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:33,819
There aren't any others
It's just you and me.

575
01:05:34,027 --> 01:05:38,199
- You're joking.
- No, I couldn't get anybody.

576
01:05:38,406 --> 01:05:41,493
I don't believe it!
This town ain't that low.

577
01:05:41,744 --> 01:05:45,497
- I couldn't get anybody.
- Then it's just you and me.

578
01:05:45,706 --> 01:05:48,959
- I guess so.
- You and me against all of them?

579
01:05:50,503 --> 01:05:54,882
- That's right. Do you want out, Hern?
- Well..

580
01:05:55,884 --> 01:05:59,387
It isn't that I want out, no. You see...

581
01:05:59,554 --> 01:06:03,934
- I didn't figure on anything like this.
- Neither did I.

582
01:06:04,141 --> 01:06:07,354
I volunteered, you know I did.
I was ready.

583
01:06:07,562 --> 01:06:12,984
I...I'm ready now, but this ain't like
what you said it was gonna be.

584
01:06:13,152 --> 01:06:16,488
This is just committing suicide.
I'm no law man.

585
01:06:16,696 --> 01:06:20,033
I just live here.
I got nothing personal against nobody.

586
01:06:20,284 --> 01:06:23,871
- I got no stake in this.
- I guess not.

587
01:06:24,705 --> 01:06:29,085
There's a limit how much you can ask a man.
What about my kids?

588
01:06:30,544 --> 01:06:32,671
Go on home to your kids, Herb.

589
01:06:37,635 --> 01:06:40,638
You get some of the other fellows,
and I go through with it.

590
01:06:40,805 --> 01:06:43,809
Go on home, Herb.

591
01:07:09,210 --> 01:07:15,132
- What do you want?
- I found them, all but Mr Henderson.

592
01:07:15,342 --> 01:07:19,095
- I found him. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

593
01:07:19,804 --> 01:07:23,350
Marshal, let me fight with you.
I ain't afraid.

594
01:07:24,768 --> 01:07:28,480
- No.
- Please, let me, marshal!

595
01:07:28,688 --> 01:07:31,483
- You're a kid, you're a baby.
- I'm 16!

596
01:07:31,649 --> 01:07:36,238
- I can handle a gun, too.
- You're 14. What do you wanna lie for?

597
01:07:36,406 --> 01:07:39,658
I'm big for my ago. Please, marshal!

598
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:44,538
Well, you're big for your age,
but no, go on, get out of here.

599
01:10:54,194 --> 01:10:57,490
Hey, Charlie. You can go home now.

600
01:10:59,575 --> 01:11:02,036
Thanks, marshal!

601
01:11:03,912 --> 01:11:07,082
Sure appreciate it. Certainly do.

602
01:11:13,632 --> 01:11:16,468
You don't happen to know
if the saloon's open?

603
01:11:16,634 --> 01:11:19,470
- I said, go home, Charlie.
- Yes, sir.

604
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:27,813
- So long, Helen.
- Goodbye, Sam.

605
01:11:28,021 --> 01:11:29,940
Take care.

606
01:13:04,622 --> 01:13:06,874
- Hello, Frank.
- How are you, Frank?

607
01:13:07,834 --> 01:13:10,044
- Everything ready?
- Just the way you wanted.

608
01:13:10,211 --> 01:13:14,674
- We've got your gun over here.
- Let's get started then.

609
01:15:37,406 --> 01:15:40,784
- Can't you wait?
- Just wanna be ready.

610
01:16:32,881 --> 01:16:34,507
Miller!

611
01:23:04,455 --> 01:23:09,002
Kane, come on out...or your friend
will get it the way Pierce did.

612
01:23:12,298 --> 01:23:14,591
I'll come out, let her go.

613
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:18,012
As you soon as you walk through that door.
I'll hold my fire.
