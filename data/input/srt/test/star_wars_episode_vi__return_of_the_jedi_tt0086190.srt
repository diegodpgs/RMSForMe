1
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,110
Command station, this is ST-321.
Code clearance blue.

2
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,030
We're starting our approach.
Deactivate the security shield.

3
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,750
The security deflector shield
will be deactivated...

4
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,070
when we have confirmation
of your code transmission.

5
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,310
Stand by.

6
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,550
You are clear to proceed.

7
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,870
We're starting our approach.

8
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,750
Inform the commander
that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

9
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,910
Sir.

10
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,150
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected
pleasure. We're honoured.

11
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,470
You may dispense
with the pleasantries, Commander.

12
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,980
I'm here to put you back on schedule.

13
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,030
I assure you, Lord Vader,
my men are working as fast as they can.

14
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,430
Perhaps I can find
new ways to motivate them.

15
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,550
I tell you this station
will be operational as planned.

16
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,390
The emperor does not share your
optimistic appraisal of the situation.

17
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,590
But he asks the impossible.
I need more men.

18
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,710
Then perhaps you can tell him
when he arrives.

19
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,270
- The emperor's coming here?
- That is correct, Commander...

20
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,950
and he is most displeased with
your apparent lack of progress.

21
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,430
We shall double our efforts.

22
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,710
I hope so, Commander, for your sake.

23
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,540
The emperor is not
as forgiving as I am.

24
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,110
Of course I'm worried.
And you should be too.

25
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,860
Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca
never returned from this awful place.

26
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,110
Don't be so sure.

27
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,390
If I told you half the things
I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt...

28
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,310
you'd probably short-circuit.

29
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,270
R2, are you sure
this is the right place?

30
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,230
I'd better knock, I suppose.

31
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,750
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Let's go back and tell Master Luke.

32
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,030
Goodness gracious me!

33
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,630
I don't think
they're going to let us in, R2.

34
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,230
We'd better go.

35
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,470
R2, wait.

36
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,190
Oh, dear. R2.

37
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,470
R2, I really don't think
we should rush into all this.

38
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,430
Oh, R2!

39
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,070
R2, wait for me!

40
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,350
Just you deliver Master Luke's message
and get us out of here.

41
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,350
Oh, my!

42
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,220
Oh, no.

43
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,510
Oh, my.

44
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,030
We bring a message
to your master,Jabba the Hutt.

45
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,710
And a gift.

46
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,110
What gift?

47
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,950
He says that our instructions
are to give it only to Jabba himself.

48
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,980
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever
so stubborn about these sort of things.

49
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,590
R2, I have a bad feeling about this.

50
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,750
Good morning.

51
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,950
The message, R2.
The message.

52
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,190
<i>Greetings, Exalted One.</i>

53
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,510
<i>Allow me to introduce myself.</i>

54
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,340
<i>I am Luke Skywalker,</i>
<i>Jedi knight and friend to Captain Solo.</i>

55
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,680
<i>I know that you are powerful,</i>
<i>mighty Jabba...</i>

56
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,310
<i>and that your anger with Solo</i>
<i>must be equally powerful.</i>

57
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,060
<i>I seek an audience with Your Greatness</i>
<i>to bargain for Solo's life.</i>

58
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,230
<i>With your wisdom, I'm sure</i>
<i>we can work out an arrangement...</i>

59
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,990
<i>which will be mutually beneficial...</i>

60
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,680
<i>and enable us to avoid</i>
<i>any unpleasant confrontation.</i>

61
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,750
<i>As a token of my goodwill,</i>
<i>I present to you a gift--</i>

62
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,550
<i>these two droids.</i>

63
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,470
What did he say?

64
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,990
<i>Both are hard-working</i>
<i>and will serve you well.</i>

65
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,710
This can't be.
R2, you're playing the wrong message.

66
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,750
He's no Jedi.

67
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,190
We're doomed.

68
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,350
R2, look. Captain Solo.

69
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,910
And he's still frozen in carbonite.

70
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,870
What could possibly
have come over Master Luke?

71
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,660
Was it something I did? He never
expressed any unhappiness with my work.

72
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,230
How horrid!

73
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,190
Good. New acquisitions.

74
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,830
You are a protocol droid,
are you not?

75
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,790
I am C-3PO--

76
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,590
Yes or no will do.

77
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,150
Well, yes.

78
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,660
How many languages do you speak?

79
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,270
I am fluent in over six million forms
of communication and can readily--

80
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,910
Splendid. We have been
without an interpreter...

81
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,230
since our master got angry
with our last protocol droid...

82
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,070
and disintegrated him.

83
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,710
Disintegrated?

84
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,070
Guard, this protocol droid
might be useful.

85
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,270
Fit him with a restraining bolt...

86
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,590
and take him back up to
His Excellency's main audience chamber.

87
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,070
R2, don't leave me!

88
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,070
You're a feisty little one...

89
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,550
but you'll soon learn some respect.

90
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,830
I have need for you on
the master's sail barge...

91
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,550
and I think you'll fill in nicely.

92
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,230
Ah! Do that again!

93
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,270
Oh, no. Chewbacca.

94
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,470
Yes, I am here,
Your Worshipfulness.

95
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,820
Yes?

96
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,590
The illustrious Jabba
bids you welcome...

97
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,180
and will gladly pay you
the reward of 25,000.

98
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,830
"50,000. No less.''

99
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,870
What did I say?

100
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,510
The mighty Jabba asks why
he must pay 50,000.

101
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,550
Because he's holding
a thermal detonator.

102
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,110
Jabba offers the sum of 35...

103
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,310
and I do suggest you take it.

104
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,190
He agrees!

105
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,700
Just relax for a moment.

106
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,350
You're free of the carbonite.

107
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,670
You have hibernation sickness.

108
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,070
- I can't see.
- Your eyesight will return in time.

109
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,350
- Where am I?
-Jabba's palace.

110
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,070
Who are you?

111
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,230
- Someone who loves you.
- Leia.

112
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,510
I gotta get you out of here.

113
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,790
What's that?

114
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,230
I know that laugh.

115
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,180
Hey,Jabba.

116
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,030
Look,Jabba, I was just
on my way to pay you back.

117
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,910
I got a little sidetracked.
It's not my fault.

118
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,070
Look--

119
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,270
Take him away.

120
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,580
You're throwing away a fortune here.
Don't be a fool.

121
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,310
We have powerful friends.

122
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,590
You're gonna regret this.

123
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,830
I can't bear to watch.

124
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,230
Chewie?

125
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,830
Chewie, is that you?

126
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,180
Wait a minute.
I can't see, pal.

127
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,070
What's going on?

128
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,030
Luke? Luke's crazy.

129
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,550
He can't even take care of himself,
much less rescue anybody.

130
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,150
AJedi knight?

131
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,620
I'm out of it for a little while,
everybody gets delusions of grandeur.

132
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,750
I'm all right, pal.

133
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,030
I'm all right.

134
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,710
I must speak with Jabba.

135
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,590
No bargain.

136
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,070
You will take me to Jabba now.

137
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,070
You serve your master well.

138
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,790
And you will be rewarded.

139
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,430
At last! Master Luke's
come to rescue me.

140
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,910
Master.

141
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,870
Luke Skywalker,Jedi knight.

142
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,910
I must be allowed to speak.

143
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,870
You will bring Captain Solo
and the Wookiee to me.

144
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,750
Nevertheless...

145
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,710
I'm taking Captain Solo
and his friends.

146
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,510
You can either profit by this
or be destroyed.

147
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,470
It's your choice, but I warn you
not to underestimate my powers.

148
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,630
Master Luke, you're standing on--

149
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,980
Oh, no! The rancor!

150
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,390
Han.

151
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,870
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Together again, huh?

152
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,300
- Wouldn't miss it.
- How are we doin'?

153
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,000
- Same as always.
- That bad, huh?

154
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,500
- Where's Leia?
- I'm here.

155
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,390
Oh, dear.

156
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,190
His High Exaltedness,
the great Jabba the Hutt...

157
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,230
has decreed that you are
to be terminated immediately.

158
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,910
Good. I hate long waits.

159
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,700
You will therefore be taken
to the Dune Sea...

160
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,070
and cast into the Pit of Carkoon...

161
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,390
nesting place
of the all-powerful Sarlacc.

162
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,660
Doesn't sound so bad.

163
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,500
In his belly, you will find a new
definition of pain and suffering...

164
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,590
as you are slowly digested
over 1,000 years.

165
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,070
On second thought,
let's pass on that.

166
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,750
You should have bargained,Jabba.

167
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,790
That's the last mistake
you'll ever make.

168
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,870
I think my eyes are getting better.

169
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,990
Instead of a big dark blur,
I see a big light blur.

170
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,870
There's nothing to see.
I used to live here, you know.

171
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,710
You're gonna die here,
you know. Convenient.

172
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,030
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando.

173
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,390
I've taken care of everything.

174
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,460
Great.

175
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,580
I'm terribly sorry.

176
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,510
R2, what are you doing here?

177
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,550
I can see you're serving drinks,
but this place is dangerous.

178
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,510
They're going to execute Master Luke,
and if we're not careful, us too.

179
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,110
I wish I had your confidence.

180
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,590
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc...

181
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,710
His Excellency hopes
that you will die honourably.

182
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,980
But should any of you
wish to beg for mercy...

183
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,950
the great Jabba the Hutt
will now listen to your pleas.

184
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,120
3PO, you tell that slimy piece
of worm-ridden filth...

185
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,750
he'll get no such pleasure from us!

186
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,590
Right?

187
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,750
This is your last chance.

188
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,870
Free us or die.

189
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,030
Easy, Chewie.

190
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,990
Help!

191
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,590
Chewie, you're hit?
Where is it?

192
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,830
Han, Chewie!

193
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,940
Lando.

194
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,990
Boba Fett?

195
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,310
Boba Fett? Where?

196
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,070
- Lando, grab it!
- Lower it!

197
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,510
I'm trying!

198
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,060
Grab me, Chewie.
Grab it!

199
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,430
Grab it. Almost.
You almost got it.

200
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,710
Gently, now.

201
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,790
Easy. Hold me, Chewie.

202
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,550
Chewie, give me the gun.

203
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,550
- Don't move, Lando.
- Wait! I thought you were blind!

204
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,590
I can see a lot better.
Don't move.

205
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,190
A little higher!

206
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,150
Chewie, pull us up.

207
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,710
Up, Chewie. Up.

208
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,990
We gotta get out of here.

209
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,390
Not my eyes! R2, help!

210
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,350
Quickly, R2!

211
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,820
Beast!

212
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,750
Get the gun!

213
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,070
Point it at the deck.

214
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,870
Point it at the deck!

215
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,950
R2, where are we going?
I couldn't possibly--

216
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,350
Come on.

217
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,430
- Let's go. Don't forget the droids.
- We're on our way.

218
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,030
I'll meet you back at the fleet.

219
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,670
<i>Hurry. The Alliance</i>
<i>should be assembled by now.</i>

220
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,360
- I will.
- <i>Luke, thanks.</i>

221
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,590
<i>Thanks for coming after me.</i>
<i>Now I owe you one.</i>

222
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,380
That's right, R2.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

223
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,710
I have a promise to keep...

224
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,710
to an old friend.

225
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,190
Rise, my friend.

226
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,750
The Death Star will be
completed on schedule.

227
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,900
You've done well, Lord Vader.

228
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,630
Now I sense you wish to continue
your search for young Skywalker.

229
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,350
Yes, my master.

230
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,630
Patience, my friend.

231
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,950
In time, he will seek you out.

232
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,310
When he does,
you must bring him before me.

233
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,630
He has grown strong.

234
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:32,190
Only together can we turn him
to the dark side of the Force.

235
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,990
As you wish.

236
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,390
Everything is proceeding
as I have foreseen.

237
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,510
That face you make--

238
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,990
Look I so old to young eyes?

239
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,790
No, of course not.

240
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,710
I do.

241
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,590
Yes, I do.

242
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,060
Sick have I become.

243
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,070
Old and weak.

244
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,390
When 900 years old you reach...

245
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,270
Iook as good you will not.

246
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,910
Soon will I rest.

247
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,030
Yes. Forever sleep.

248
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,150
Earned it I have.

249
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,840
Master Yoda, you can't die.

250
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,920
Strong am I with the Force...

251
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,910
but not that strong.

252
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:09,430
Twilight is upon me,
and soon night must fall.

253
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,790
That is the way of things...

254
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,950
the way of the Force.

255
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,590
But I need your help.

256
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,750
I've come back
to complete the training.

257
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,910
No more training do you require.

258
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,030
Already know you
that which you need.

259
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,190
Then I am a Jedi.

260
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,430
Not yet.

261
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,470
One thing remains--

262
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,710
Vader. You must confront Vader.

263
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,430
Then-- only then--
a Jedi will you be.

264
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,150
And confront him you will.

265
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,030
Master Yoda...

266
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,940
is Darth Vader my father?

267
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,340
Rest I need.

268
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,830
Yes.

269
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,510
Rest.

270
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,230
Yoda, I must know.

271
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,470
Your father he is.

272
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,950
Told you, did he?

273
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,950
Yes.

274
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,910
Unexpected this is.

275
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,190
And unfortunate.

276
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,870
Unfortunate that I know the truth?

277
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,220
No.

278
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,070
Unfortunate that
you rushed to face him...

279
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,630
that incomplete
was your training...

280
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,030
that not ready
for the burden were you.

281
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,510
I'm sorry.

282
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,950
Remember, a Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

283
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,470
But beware.

284
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,990
Anger, fear, aggression...

285
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,630
the dark side are they.

286
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,900
Once you start down the dark path...

287
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,630
forever will it dominate your destiny.

288
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,270
Do not--

289
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:01,550
Do not underestimate
the powers of the emperor...

290
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,910
or suffer your father's fate you will.

291
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,150
When gone am I...

292
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,950
the last of the Jedi will you be.

293
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,190
The Force runs strong in your family.

294
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,030
Pass on what you have learned.

295
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,190
There is...

296
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,910
another...

297
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,070
Skywalker.

298
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,190
I can't do it, R2.

299
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,220
I can't go on alone.

300
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,430
<i>Yoda will always be with you.</i>

301
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,620
Obi-Wan.

302
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,910
Why didn't you tell me?

303
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,740
You told me Vader betrayed
and murdered my father.

304
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:29,150
Your father was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

305
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,030
He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker
and became Darth Vader.

306
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,590
When that happened...

307
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,750
the good man who was
your father was destroyed.

308
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,060
So what I told you was true...

309
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,950
from a certain point of view.

310
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,430
A certain point of view?

311
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,260
Luke, you're going to find
that many of the truths we cling to...

312
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,190
depend greatly
on our own point of view.

313
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,550
Anakin was a good friend.

314
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,990
When I first knew him...

315
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,190
your father was already a great pilot...

316
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,790
but I was amazed how strongly
the Force was with him.

317
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,700
I took it upon myself
to train him as a Jedi.

318
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,590
I thought that I could instruct him
just as well as Yoda.

319
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,940
I was wrong.

320
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,670
There is still good in him.

321
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,430
He's more machine now than man...

322
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,430
twisted and evil.

323
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,230
I can't do it, Ben.

324
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,190
You cannot escape your destiny.

325
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,430
You must face Darth Vader again.

326
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,230
I can't kill my own father.

327
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,310
Then the emperor has already won.

328
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,470
You were our only hope.

329
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,750
Yoda spoke of another.

330
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,180
The other he spoke of
is your twin sister.

331
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,950
But I have no sister.

332
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,870
To protect you both
from the emperor...

333
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,430
you were hidden from your father
when you were born.

334
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,910
The emperor knew, as I did...

335
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,580
if Anakin were to have any offspring...

336
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,150
they would be a threat to him.

337
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,350
That is the reason why your sister
remains safely anonymous.

338
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,580
- Leia is my sister.
- Your insight serves you well.

339
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,590
Bury your feelings deep down, Luke.

340
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,990
They do you credit...

341
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,070
but they could be made
to serve the emperor.

342
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,200
Look at you. A general, huh?

343
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,270
Someone must have told them about
my manoeuvre at the Battle of Tanaab.

344
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,150
Don't look at me, pal.
I just said you were a fair pilot.

345
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,110
I didn't know they were looking for
somebody to lead this crazy attack.

346
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,270
I'm surprised they didn't
ask you to do it.

347
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,990
Who says they didn't?
But I ain't crazy.

348
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,830
You're the respectable one, remember?

349
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,670
The emperor's made a critical error
and the time for our attack has come.

350
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,140
The data brought to us by the Bothan
spies pinpoint the exact location...

351
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,310
of the emperor's new battle station.

352
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,150
We also know
that the weapon systems...

353
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,430
of this Death Star
are not yet operational.

354
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,390
With the imperial fleet
spread throughout the galaxy...

355
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,950
in a vain effort to engage us...

356
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,870
it is relatively unprotected.

357
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,950
But most important of all...

358
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,670
we've learned that
the emperor himself...

359
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,830
is personally overseeing
the final stages...

360
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,310
of the construction
of this Death Star.

361
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:57,430
Many Bothans died
to bring us this information.

362
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,150
Admiral Ackbar, please.

363
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:06,190
You can see here the Death Star
orbiting the forest moon of Endor.

364
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:11,550
Although the weapon systems on this
Death Star are not yet operational...

365
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,030
the Death Star does have
a strong defence mechanism.

366
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,470
It is protected by an energy shield...

367
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,070
which is generated
from the nearby forest moon of Endor.

368
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,070
The shield must be deactivated
if any attack is to be attempted.

369
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,190
Once the shield is down,
our cruisers will create a perimeter...

370
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,110
while the fighters
fly into the superstructure...

371
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,070
and attempt to knock out
the main reactor.

372
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,710
General Calrissian has volunteered
to lead the fighter attack.

373
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,060
Good luck.

374
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,510
You're gonna need it.

375
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,270
General Madine.

376
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:01,070
We have stolen a small imperial shuttle.

377
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,230
Disguised as a cargo ship
and using a secret imperial code...

378
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:10,950
a strike team will land on the moon
and deactivate the shield generator.

379
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,270
Sounds dangerous.

380
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,590
Wonder who they found
to pull that off.

381
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,590
General Solo,
is your strike team assembled?

382
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,470
My team's ready. I don't have
a command crew for the shuttle.

383
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,590
It's gonna be rough.
I didn't wanna speak for you.

384
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,740
- That's one.
- General, count me in.

385
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,710
I'm with you too.

386
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,990
- What is it?
- Ask me again sometime.

387
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,590
Hi, Han, Chewie.

388
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,030
"Exciting'' is hardly the word
I would choose.

389
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,910
Look, I want you to take her.

390
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,510
I mean it. Take her.

391
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,910
You need all the help you can get.
She's the fastest ship in the fleet.

392
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,270
All right, old buddy.

393
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,310
I know what she means to you.

394
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,980
I'll take good care of her.
She won't get a scratch.

395
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,590
All right?

396
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,940
Right.

397
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,020
I got your promise.
Not a scratch.

398
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,230
Would you get going, you pirate?

399
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,030
Good luck.

400
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,590
You too.

401
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,230
- Got her warmed?
- Yeah, she's coming up.

402
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,270
I don't think the Empire had Wookiees
in mind when they designed her, Chewie.

403
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,030
Hey, you awake?

404
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,470
Yeah. I just got a funny feeling,
like I'm not gonna see her again.

405
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,790
Come on, General. Let's move.

406
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,110
Right. Chewie, let's see
what this piece of junk can do.

407
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,350
- Ready, everybody?
- All set.

408
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,510
Here we go again.

409
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,910
All right, hang on.

410
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,940
What is thy bidding, my master?

411
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,190
Send the fleet
to the far side of Endor.

412
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:12,470
There it will stay until called for.

413
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,670
What of the reports of the rebel fleet
massing near Sullust?

414
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,710
It is of no concern.

415
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,550
Soon the rebellion will be crushed
and young Skywalker will be one of us.

416
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,390
Your work here is finished, my friend.

417
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,080
Go out to the command ship
and await my orders.

418
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,030
Yes, my master.

419
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:51,030
If they don't go for this, we're gonna
have to get out pretty quick.

420
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,760
<i>We have you on our screen now.</i>
<i>Please identify.</i>

421
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,900
Shuttle <i>Tydirium</i> requesting
deactivation of the deflector shield.

422
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,230
Shuttle <i>Tydirium,</i> transmit
the clearance code for shield passage.

423
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,950
Transmission commencing.

424
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,950
Now we find out if that code
is worth the price we paid.

425
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,110
It'll work. It'll work.

426
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,510
Vader's on that ship.

427
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,390
Don't get jittery, Luke.

428
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,630
There are a lot of command ships.

429
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,110
Keep your distance, Chewie, but don't
look like you're keeping your distance.

430
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,670
I don't know. Fly casual.

431
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,510
Where is that shuttle going?

432
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,550
Shuttle <i>Tydirium,</i>
what is your cargo and destination?

433
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,430
<i>Parts and technical crew</i>
<i>for the forest moon.</i>

434
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,070
Do they have a code clearance?

435
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,990
It's an older code, sir,
but it checks out.

436
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,990
I was about to clear them.

437
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,790
I'm endangering the mission.
I shouldn't have come.

438
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,110
It's your imagination, kid.

439
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,870
Come on. Let's keep
a little optimism here.

440
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,070
Shall I hold them?

441
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,870
No. Leave them to me.

442
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,190
I will deal with them myself.

443
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,150
As you wish, my lord. Carry on.

444
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,750
They're not going for it, Chewie.

445
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,430
<i>Shuttle</i> Tydirium...

446
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,830
<i>deactivation of the shield</i>
<i>will commence immediately.</i>

447
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,150
<i>Follow your present course.</i>

448
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,660
Okay. I told you
it was gonna work.

449
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,910
No problem.

450
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,910
I told you it was dangerous here.

451
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:45,030
- Should we try and go around?
- It'll take time.

452
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:48,030
This whole party will be
for nothing if they see us.

453
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,950
Chewie and I will take care of this.
You stay here.

454
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,640
Quietly. There might be
more of them out there.

455
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,070
Hey...

456
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,420
it's me.

457
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,910
Go for help! Go!

458
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,470
Great. Come on!

459
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,270
Over there! Two more of them.

460
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,470
I see them. Wait. Leia!

461
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,590
Hey, wait!

462
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,990
Quick, jam their comlink.
Centre switch.

463
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,670
Move closer.

464
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,430
Get alongside that one.

465
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,190
Keep on that one.
I'll take these two.

466
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,310
General Solo, somebody's coming.

467
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,180
Where's Leia?

468
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,340
- She didn't come back?
- I thought she was with you.

469
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,860
We got separated.
We better go look for her.

470
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,910
Take the squad ahead. We'll meet
at the shield generator at 0300.

471
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,990
Come on, R2.
We'll need your scanners.

472
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,710
Don't worry, Master Luke.
We know what to do.

473
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,190
And you said it was pretty here.

474
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,830
Cut it out.

475
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,990
I'm not gonna hurt you.

476
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,280
Well, looks like I'm stuck here.

477
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,390
Trouble is, I don't know where here is.

478
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,270
Maybe you can help me.

479
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,110
Come on. Sit down.

480
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,030
I promise I won't hurt you.
Now come here.

481
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,100
All right.
You want something to eat?

482
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,990
That's right.

483
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,350
Come on.

484
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,070
Look. It's a hat.

485
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,070
It's not gonna hurt you. Look.

486
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,790
You're a jittery little thing,
aren't you?

487
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,350
What is it?

488
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,580
Freeze!

489
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,830
Come on. Get up.

490
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,750
- Get your ride. Take her back to base.
- Yes, sir.

491
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,470
What the--

492
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:17,300
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

493
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:00,350
I told you to remain
on the command ship.

494
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,550
A small rebel force has penetrated
the shield and landed on Endor.

495
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,710
Yes, I know.

496
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,310
My son is with them.

497
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:20,350
- Are you sure?
- I have felt him, my master.

498
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,140
Strange that I have not.

499
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:31,670
I wonder if your feelings
on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.

500
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,430
They are clear, my master.

501
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:38,630
Then you must go to
the sanctuary moon and wait for him.

502
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,630
He will come to me?

503
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,030
I have foreseen it.

504
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:51,030
His compassion for you
will be his undoing.

505
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:54,910
He will come to you,
and then you will bring him before me.

506
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,150
As you wish.

507
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,190
Master Luke.

508
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,390
There's two more
wrecked speeders back there.

509
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,350
And I found this.

510
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:33,990
I'm afraid that R2's sensors
can find no trace of Princess Leia.

511
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,870
I hope she's all right.

512
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:44,700
What, Chewie?

513
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,030
What, Chewie?

514
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:05,350
I don't get it.
It's just a dead animal.

515
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,950
Chewie, wait! Don't!

516
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,710
Nice work.

517
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,190
Great, Chewie.

518
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,310
Great. Always thinking
with your stomach.

519
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:23,470
Take it easy. Let's just figure
a way to get out of this thing.

520
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,230
Han, can you reach my lightsabre?

521
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:26,750
Yeah. Sure.

522
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,950
R2, I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

523
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:38,990
It's a very long drop!

524
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,950
Hey. Point that thing
someplace else.

525
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:31,380
Hey!

526
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,870
Han, don't. It'll be all right.

527
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,230
Chewie, give them your crossbow.

528
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:45,790
Oh, my head.

529
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,590
Oh, my goodness.

530
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,950
Do you understand
anything they're saying?

531
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,430
Oh, yes, Master Luke.

532
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:30,230
Remember that I am fluent
in over six million forms--

533
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:31,910
What are you telling them?

534
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,070
"Hello,'' I think.

535
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:38,110
I could be mistaken--
they're using a very primitive dialect--

536
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:41,630
but I do believe they think
I am some sort of god.

537
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:50,070
Why don't you use your divine
influence and get us out of this?

538
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,950
I beg your pardon, General Solo,
but that just wouldn't be proper.

539
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,230
Proper?

540
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,870
It's against my programming
to impersonate a deity.

541
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,190
Why, you--

542
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,510
My mistake.

543
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,030
He's an old friend of mine.

544
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,390
Hey.

545
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,230
I have a really bad feeling about this.

546
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,910
What did he say?

547
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,270
I'm rather embarrassed,
General Solo...

548
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:29,750
but it appears you are to be the main
course at a banquet in my honour.

549
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,830
Your Royal Highness.

550
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,630
These are my friends.

551
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,630
3PO, tell them
they must be set free.

552
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:19,750
Somehow I got the feeling
that didn't help us very much.

553
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,630
3PO, tell them
if they don't do as you wish...

554
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:26,630
you'll become angry
and use your magic.

555
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:29,030
But, Master Luke, what magic?
I couldn't possibly--

556
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,630
Just tell them.

557
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,910
You see, Master Luke?
They didn't believe me...

558
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,550
just as I said they wouldn't.

559
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:51,900
Wait.

560
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,990
What's happening?

561
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,830
Put me down!
Help!

562
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,430
Somebody!

563
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:13,830
Somebody help!

564
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,550
Master Luke! R2, quickly!

565
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,310
Thank goodness.

566
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,750
Thanks, 3PO.

567
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,830
I never knew I had it in me.

568
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:14,510
...Tatooine...

569
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:18,180
Princess Leia... R2.

570
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:21,670
...Darth Vader!

571
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,350
...Death Star.

572
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:32,390
...Jedi... Obi-Wan Kenobi.

573
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,550
Yes, R2, I was just coming to that.

574
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:43,830
Master Luke...

575
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:53,710
...<i>Millennium Falcon</i>... Cloud City.

576
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:58,310
...Vader!

577
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,510
Han Solo...

578
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,990
...carbon.

579
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:07,710
...Sarlacc.

580
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:32,190
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

581
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,960
Wonderful. We are now
a part of the tribe.

582
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,110
Just what I always wanted.

583
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,630
Short help's better than
no help at all, Chewie.

584
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:14,110
He says the scouts will show us the quickest
way to the shield generator.

585
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:16,110
Good. How far is it?

586
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:17,790
Ask him.

587
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,990
We need some fresh supplies too.

588
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:23,950
Try and get our weapons back.

589
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,510
Hurry up.
I haven't got all day.

590
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,710
Luke, what's wrong?

591
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,870
Leia, do you remember
your mother--

592
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,950
your real mother?

593
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:43,430
Just a little bit.
She died when I was very young.

594
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:45,390
What do you remember?

595
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,980
Just images really. Feelings.

596
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:49,630
Tell me.

597
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:54,190
She was... very beautiful.

598
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,830
Kind... but sad.

599
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:01,590
Why are you asking me this?

600
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:05,070
I have no memory of my mother.

601
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,990
I never knew her.

602
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:11,790
Luke, tell me.
What's troubling you?

603
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:20,140
Vader is here.
Now. On this moon.

604
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:23,350
How do you know?

605
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:25,310
I felt his presence.

606
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:29,430
He's come for me.
He can feel when I'm near.

607
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,350
That's why I have to go.

608
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:34,790
As long as I stay, I'm endangering
the group and our mission here.

609
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:38,630
- I have to face him.
- Why?

610
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,230
He's my father.

611
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,590
Your father?

612
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:57,670
There's more. It won't be easy
for you to hear it, but you must.

613
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,510
If I don't make it back,
you're the only hope for the Alliance.

614
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,070
Don't talk that way.

615
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:06,510
You have a power I don't understand
and could never have.

616
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,550
You're wrong, Leia.

617
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:10,430
You have that power too.

618
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,750
In time, you'll learn
to use it as I have.

619
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,350
The Force is strong in my family.

620
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:24,670
My father has it.

621
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:27,830
I have it.

622
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:29,230
And...

623
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,750
my sister has it.

624
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,790
Yes. It's you, Leia.

625
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,390
I know.

626
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,670
Somehow...

627
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:56,830
I've always known.

628
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,830
Then you know
why I have to face him.

629
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,180
Luke, run away.
Far away.

630
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:06,510
If he can feel your presence,
then leave this place.

631
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:09,750
- I wish I could go with you.
- No, you don't.

632
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,750
You've always been strong.

633
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,190
But why must you confront him?

634
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:19,860
Because there is good in him.
I've felt it.

635
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,910
He won't turn me over
to the emperor.

636
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:25,030
I can save him. I can turn him
back to the good side.

637
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,110
I have to try.

638
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,710
Hey, what's going on?

639
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:53,590
Nothing. I just wanna
be alone for a little while.

640
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,470
Nothing?

641
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,030
Tell me.
What's going on?

642
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,070
I can't tell you.

643
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:12,150
Could you tell Luke?
Is that who you could tell?

644
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:31,830
I'm sorry.

645
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,030
Hold me.

646
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,950
This is the rebel that surrendered.

647
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,870
Although he denies it,
I believe there may be more of them...

648
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,590
and I request permission
to conduct a further search of the area.

649
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:41,230
He was armed only with this.

650
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:45,790
Good work, Commander.

651
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:47,750
Leave us.

652
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:51,390
Conduct your search
and bring his companions to me.

653
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,470
Yes, my lord.

654
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:58,270
The emperor has been expecting you.

655
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:00,950
I know, Father.

656
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,630
So, you have accepted the truth.

657
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:10,110
I've accepted the truth that you were
once Anakin Skywalker, my father.

658
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:13,310
That name no longer
has any meaning for me.

659
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:16,710
It is the name of your true self.
You've only forgotten.

660
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,030
I know there is good in you.

661
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:21,670
The emperor hasn't
driven it from you fully.

662
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,590
That was why
you couldn't destroy me.

663
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,030
That's why you won't bring me
to your emperor now.

664
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,910
I see you have constructed
a new lightsabre.

665
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:49,230
Your skills are complete.

666
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:58,630
Indeed you are powerful,
as the emperor has foreseen.

667
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,070
Come with me.

668
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,830
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.

669
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:15,670
You don't know the power
of the dark side.

670
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:18,430
I must obey my master.

671
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:23,750
I will not turn,
and you'll be forced to kill me.

672
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:27,540
If that is your destiny.

673
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:32,300
Search your feelings, Father.
You can't do this.

674
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:34,950
I feel the conflict within you.
Let go of your hate.

675
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:39,430
It is too late for me, son.

676
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:46,670
The emperor will show you
the true nature of the Force.

677
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:50,270
He is your master now.

678
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,460
Then my father is truly dead.

679
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:41,550
The main entrance
to the control bunker...

680
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:43,590
is on the far side
of that landing platform.

681
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:47,910
- This isn't gonna be easy.
- Don't worry.

682
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:51,030
Chewie and me got into a lot of places
more heavily guarded than this.

683
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,590
What's he saying?

684
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:05,910
He says there's a secret entrance
on the other side of the ridge.

685
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:27,590
Admiral, we're in position.
All fighters accounted for.

686
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:30,310
Proceed with the countdown.

687
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:33,830
All groups assume attack coordinates.

688
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,950
Don't worry.
My friend's down there.

689
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,510
He'll have that shield down on time.

690
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,740
Or this'll be
the shortest offensive of all time.

691
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:53,180
All craft, prepare to jump
into hyperspace on my mark.

692
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:55,190
All right. Stand by.

693
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,030
Back door, huh? Good idea.

694
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:27,910
It's only a few guards.
This shouldn't be too much trouble.

695
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,590
It only takes one to sound the alarm.

696
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:38,100
Then we'll do it real quiet-like.

697
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:41,620
- Oh, my. Princess Leia.
- Quiet.

698
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:44,630
I'm afraid our furry companion...

699
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,790
has gone and done something
rather rash.

700
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,950
There goes our surprise attack.

701
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:04,110
Look, over there! Stop him!

702
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:19,430
Not bad for a little furball.
There's only one left.

703
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,910
You stay here.
We'll take care of this.

704
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:26,070
I have decided that we shall stay here.

705
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:57,670
Hey!

706
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,870
Welcome, young Skywalker.

707
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,230
I have been expecting you.

708
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,110
You'll no longer need those.

709
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:16,150
Guards, leave us.

710
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:27,590
I'm looking forward
to completing your training.

711
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:33,580
In time, you will call me master.

712
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:36,070
You're gravely mistaken.

713
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:38,230
You won't convert me
as you did my father.

714
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:42,670
Oh, no, my young Jedi.

715
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:48,630
You will find that
it is you who are mistaken...

716
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,950
about a great many things.

717
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,150
His lightsabre.

718
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:00,790
Ah, yes. AJedi's weapon.

719
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,860
Much like your father's.

720
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,590
By now you must know your father
can never be turned from the dark side.

721
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:11,430
So will it be with you.

722
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,510
You're wrong.

723
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:17,590
Soon I'll be dead--
and you with me.

724
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:25,030
Perhaps you refer to
the imminent attack of your rebel fleet.

725
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,190
Yes.

726
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:32,230
I assure you we are quite safe
from your friends here.

727
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:36,110
Your overconfidence
is your weakness.

728
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:40,230
Your faith in your friends is yours.

729
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:46,110
It is pointless to resist, my son.

730
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:55,230
Everything that has transpired
has done so according to my design.

731
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:58,430
Your friends up there
on the sanctuary moon...

732
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,710
are walking into a trap,
as is your rebel fleet.

733
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:07,940
It was I who allowed the Alliance...

734
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:11,350
to know the location
of the shield generator.

735
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:15,350
It is quite safe
from your pitiful little band.

736
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:19,550
An entire legion
of my best troops awaits them.

737
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:26,550
I'm afraid the deflector shield...

738
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:31,670
will be quite operational
when your friends arrive.

739
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:36,350
All right!

740
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,910
Up! Move!

741
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:39,430
Quickly. Quickly.

742
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,310
Han, hurry.

743
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:48,230
The fleet will be here any moment.

744
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:52,030
Charges. Come on. Come on!

745
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:55,830
Oh, my. They'll be captured.

746
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,230
Wait! Come back!

747
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:04,350
R2, stay with me.

748
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:06,910
Freeze!

749
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:12,030
You rebel scum.

750
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:36,150
- All wings report in.
- Red Leader standing by.

751
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:39,310
- Grey Leader standing by.
- Green Leader standing by.

752
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:42,190
Lock S-foils in attack positions.

753
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:47,750
May the Force be with us.

754
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:54,070
We've gotta be able to get
a reading on that shield-- up or down.

755
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:58,240
How could they be jamming us
if they don't know--

756
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:00,750
if we're coming.

757
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:04,230
Break off the attack.
The shield is still up.

758
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:07,350
I get no reading. You sure?

759
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:09,550
<i>Pull up! All craft pull up!</i>

760
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:17,660
Take evasive action. Green Group,
stick close to Holding Sector MV-7.

761
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:22,070
Admiral, we have
enemy ships in Sector 47.

762
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:24,630
It's a trap.

763
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:29,950
Fighters coming in.

764
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,550
There's too many.

765
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:40,990
Accelerate to attack speed.
Draw their fire away from the cruisers.

766
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:42,100
Copy, Gold Leader.

767
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:46,830
Come, boy.

768
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:49,550
See for yourself.

769
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:57,110
From here, you will witness
the final destruction of the Alliance...

770
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:01,910
and the end
of your insignificant rebellion.

771
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:09,190
You want this...

772
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:11,750
don't you?

773
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:17,190
The hate is swelling in you now.

774
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:20,030
Take your Jedi weapon.

775
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:22,830
Use it.

776
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:24,830
I am unarmed.

777
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:26,750
Strike me down with it.

778
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:29,310
Give in to your anger.

779
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:35,230
With each passing moment
you make yourself more my servant.

780
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:44,510
It is unavoidable.

781
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:47,590
It is your destiny.

782
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:51,590
You, like your father...

783
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:53,270
are now...

784
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:55,710
mine.

785
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:15,350
All right, move it.

786
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,590
Hello. I say, over there.

787
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:27,590
Were you looking for me?

788
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:31,830
Bring those two down here.

789
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:43,270
They're on their way.
R2, are you sure this was a good idea?

790
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:44,670
Freeze.

791
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:46,860
Don't move.

792
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,830
We surrender.

793
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:56,150
The code's changed.

794
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:58,550
- We need R2.
- Here's the terminal.

795
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:00,590
R2, where are you?

796
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:02,590
We need you at the bunker
right away.

797
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:06,030
Going? What do you mean?

798
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:10,230
Going where, R2?

799
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:14,390
Wait. R2, this is
no time for heroics.

800
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:16,110
Come back!

801
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:43,990
Watch yourself, Wedge.
Three from above.

802
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:46,910
- Red Three, Red Two, pull in.
- Got it.

803
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:51,710
Three of them coming in, 20 degrees.

804
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:53,470
Cut left.
I'll take the leader.

805
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:03,150
They're heading
for the medical frigate.

806
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:10,100
Pressure's steady.

807
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:22,070
Only the fighters are attacking.
What are the Stardestroyers waiting for?

808
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,150
We're in attack position, sir.

809
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:31,310
- Hold here.
- We're not going to attack?

810
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:35,590
I have my orders are from the emperor himself.
He has something special planned.

811
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:37,550
We only need to
keep them from escaping.

812
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:44,110
As you can see,
my young apprentice...

813
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:47,350
your friends have failed.

814
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:50,390
Now witness the firepower...

815
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:55,640
of this fully armed
and operational battle station.

816
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:59,190
Fire at will, Commander.

817
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:08,550
Fire.

818
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:17,350
That blast came from the Death Star.

819
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:20,510
That thing's operational.

820
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:22,390
Home 1, this is Gold Leader.

821
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:24,510
We saw it.
All craft prepare to retreat.

822
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:26,750
You won't get
another chance at this, Admiral.

823
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:29,510
We have no choice, General Calrissian.

824
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:32,790
Our cruisers can't repel
firepower of that magnitude.

825
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:36,460
Han will have that shield down.
We've gotta give him more time.

826
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:56,870
We're coming.

827
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:03,790
Come on.

828
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:08,750
R2, hurry!

829
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:16,470
My goodness!

830
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:25,230
Why did you have to be so brave?

831
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:30,710
Well, I suppose I could
hot-wire this thing.

832
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:32,230
I'll cover you.

833
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:15,470
Yes, I said closer.
Move as close as you can...

834
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:18,190
and engage those Stardestroyers
at point-blank range.

835
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:21,590
At that close range, we won't last long
against those Stardestroyers.

836
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:25,230
We'll last longer than we will
against that Death Star...

837
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:27,510
and we might
take a few of them with us.

838
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:31,590
She's gonna blow!

839
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:37,030
I'm hit!

840
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,070
Your fleet is lost...

841
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:49,070
and your friends on the Endor moon
will not survive.

842
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:53,580
There is no escape...

843
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:56,230
my young apprentice.

844
01:43:58,360 --> 01:44:00,710
The Alliance will die...

845
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:06,230
as will your friends.

846
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:10,940
Good.

847
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:15,030
I can feel your anger.

848
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:20,070
I am defenceless.
Take your weapon.

849
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:23,190
Strike me down
with all of your hatred...

850
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:27,630
and your journey towards
the dark side will be complete.

851
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:09,270
- Look!
- Get him off of there.

852
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:04,710
I think I got it.

853
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:06,030
I got it!

854
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:14,260
Are you all right?

855
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:16,190
- Let's see.
- It's not bad.

856
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:17,540
- Freeze!
- Oh, dear.

857
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:19,110
Don't move.

858
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:26,990
- I love you.
- I know.

859
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:28,390
Hands up.

860
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:30,620
Stand up.

861
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:41,470
Stay back.

862
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:52,670
Get down here.
She's wounded.

863
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:54,550
No, wait.

864
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:56,190
I got an idea.

865
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,470
Good.

866
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:13,220
Use your aggressive feelings, boy.

867
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:15,950
Let the hate flow through you.

868
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:24,830
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

869
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:30,430
I will not fight you, Father.

870
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:47,630
You are unwise
to lower your defences.

871
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:14,860
Your thoughts betray you, Father.

872
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,990
I feel the good in you, the conflict.

873
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:20,470
There is no conflict.

874
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:24,630
You couldn't bring yourself
to kill me before...

875
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:26,630
and I don't believe
you'll destroy me now.

876
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:32,110
You underestimate
the power of the dark side.

877
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:33,990
If you will not fight...

878
01:49:34,120 --> 01:49:36,580
then you will meet your destiny.

879
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:48,740
Good.

880
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:50,230
Good.

881
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:03,030
- Watch out. Squad at .06.
- I'm on it, Gold Leader.

882
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:06,230
Good shot, Red Two.

883
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:12,670
We're sure in the middle of it now.
Come on, Han, old buddy.

884
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:14,390
Don't let me down.

885
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:21,150
<i>It's over, Commander.</i>

886
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:23,510
<i>The rebels have been routed.</i>
<i>They're fleeing.</i>

887
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:26,070
<i>We need reinforcements</i>
<i>to continue the pursuit.</i>

888
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:28,990
Send three squads to help.

889
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,990
- Open the back door.
- Sir.

890
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:46,950
Throw me another charge.

891
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:06,470
You cannot hide forever, Luke.

892
01:51:07,680 --> 01:51:09,510
I will not fight you.

893
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:16,790
Give yourself to the dark side.

894
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:22,190
It is the only way
you can save your friends.

895
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:24,830
Yes.

896
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:26,830
Your thoughts betray you.

897
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:29,390
Your feelings for them are strong...

898
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:32,310
especially for...

899
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,990
sister.

900
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:41,350
So you have a twin sister.

901
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:45,020
Your feelings have now
betrayed her too.

902
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:49,070
Obi-Wan was wise
to hide her from me.

903
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:53,390
Now his failure is complete.

904
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:58,460
If you will not turn
to the dark side...

905
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:02,270
then perhaps she will.

906
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:03,270
Never!

907
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:50,670
Good!

908
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:57,430
Your hate has made you powerful.

909
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:03,350
Now, fulfil your destiny...

910
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:08,390
and take your father's place at my side.

911
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:24,110
Never.

912
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:29,110
I'll never turn to the dark side.

913
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:35,670
You've failed, Your Highness.

914
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:37,670
I am a Jedi...

915
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:39,750
like my father before me.

916
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:51,350
So be it,Jedi.

917
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:53,350
Move! Move!

918
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:09,180
The shield is down. Commence attack
on the Death Star's main reactor.

919
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:12,910
We're on our way. Red Group,
Gold Group, all fighters follow me.

920
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:14,870
I told you they'd do it.

921
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:26,230
If you will not be turned...

922
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:29,550
you will be destroyed.

923
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:37,950
Young fool.

924
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,590
Only now, at the end...

925
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:43,510
do you understand.

926
01:54:57,200 --> 01:55:02,710
Your feeble skills are no match
for the power of the dark side.

927
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:10,070
You have paid the price
for your lack of vision.

928
01:55:16,440 --> 01:55:18,190
Father, please!

929
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:34,950
Now, young Skywalker...

930
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,750
you will die.

931
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:02,510
I'm going in.

932
01:57:05,560 --> 01:57:06,700
Here goes nothing.

933
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:18,220
Lock onto the strongest power source.
It should be the power generator.

934
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:23,670
Form up. Stay alert.
We could run out of space real fast.

935
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:41,630
Split up and head back to the surface.

936
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:44,790
See if you can get a few
of those TIE fighters to follow you.

937
01:57:44,920 --> 01:57:45,830
Copy, Gold Leader.

938
01:57:55,720 --> 01:57:57,230
That was too close.

939
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:04,150
We've got to give
those fighters more time.

940
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:07,190
Concentrate all fire
on that Super Stardestroyer.

941
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:16,110
Sir, we've lost our
bridge deflector shields.

942
01:58:16,240 --> 01:58:19,110
Intensify the forward batteries.
I don't want anything to get through.

943
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:23,190
Intensify forward firepower!

944
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:27,100
Too late!

945
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:15,060
Help me take this mask off.

946
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:16,990
But you'll die.

947
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:21,190
Nothing can stop that now.

948
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:24,790
Just for once...

949
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:27,270
let me...

950
01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:30,710
Iook on you with my own eyes.

951
02:00:07,480 --> 02:00:11,670
Now go, my son.

952
02:00:13,320 --> 02:00:14,670
Leave me.

953
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:18,070
No. You're coming with me.

954
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:20,430
I'll not leave you here.
I've got to save you.

955
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:24,820
You already have, Luke.

956
02:00:25,960 --> 02:00:27,750
You were right.

957
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:30,750
You were right about me.

958
02:00:33,600 --> 02:00:35,310
Tell your sister...

959
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:38,430
you were right.

960
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:46,270
Father.

961
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:51,710
I won't leave you.

962
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:18,070
There it is.

963
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:23,190
Wedge, go for the power regulator
on the north tower.

964
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:26,470
Copy, Gold Leader.
I'm already on my way out.

965
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:48,910
Move the fleet
away from the Death Star.

966
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:37,790
They did it!

967
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:48,220
I'm sure Luke wasn't
on that thing when it blew.

968
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:51,670
He wasn't.

969
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:54,390
I can feel it.

970
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:00,390
You love him.

971
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:05,030
Don't you?

972
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:06,550
Yes.

973
02:03:07,680 --> 02:03:10,270
All right. I understand.

974
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:11,710
Fine.

975
02:03:12,720 --> 02:03:14,430
When he comes back...

976
02:03:15,480 --> 02:03:17,150
I won't get in the way.

977
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:22,630
It's not like that at all.

978
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:28,430
He's my brother.
