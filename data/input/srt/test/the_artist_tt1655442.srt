1
00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:12,938
I won't talk!
I won't say a word!!!

2
00:02:25,418 --> 00:02:26,869
Speak!

3
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,915
SPEAK!

4
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:13,225
Please, be silent
behind the screen

5
00:05:17,965 --> 00:05:20,418
Long live free Georgia !!!

6
00:06:57,315 --> 00:06:59,517
I will get you for this.

00:08:11,347 --> 00:08:15,718
"A Russian Affair"
George Valentin

8
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:56,193
WHO'S THAT GIRL?
That's the question on
everyone's lips. Who indeed?

KINOGRAPH STUDIOS

10
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:42,109
Listen up! Three girls
who can dance

11
00:13:28,497 --> 00:13:31,617
The name's Miller.
Peppy Miller !

12
00:14:34,605 --> 00:14:38,976
Clifton, go to the jewelry store. Get something
nice for my wife. To make it up to her.

13
00:15:40,743 --> 00:15:45,253
With all your nonsense, they don't
mention our movie until page 5 !

14
00:17:47,462 --> 00:17:50,362
Where are you going, Miss?
We have a picture to shot.

15
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:28,107
If you want to be an actress, you
need to have something the others don't.

16
00:28:42,245 --> 00:28:44,572
I have something to
show you.

17
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:55,166
May I have my chair?

18
00:28:56,676 --> 00:28:59,253
Hey, you're not Napoleon.
You're just an extra!

19
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:05,176
SOUND TEST
Constance Gray
in Romeo & Juliet.

20
00:30:16,964 --> 00:30:19,542
Don't laugh, George!
That's the future.

21
00:30:21,761 --> 00:30:24,713
If that's the future,
you can have it!

22

To Work Exclusively On Talkies

24
00:35:03,751 --> 00:35:07,829
You and I belong to another era,
George. The world is talking now.

25
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:17,006
People want new faces,
talking faces.

26
00:35:25,439 --> 00:35:29,393
I wish it wasn't like this, but the public wants
fresh meat and the public is never wrong.

27
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:45,076
I'm the one people come to see.
They never needed to hear me!

28
00:35:52,925 --> 00:35:55,436
Make your talking movies. I'll make a great
movie.

29
00:35:55,511 --> 00:35:57,797
And it's not like I need you for that!.

THE NEW FACES
of KINOGRAPH

31
00:36:14,864 --> 00:36:16,649
"Fresh meat..."

32
00:37:02,823 --> 00:37:06,532
What a coincidence, I was just thinking
about you. I signed with Kinograph!

33
00:37:13,923 --> 00:37:17,293
Maybe now we'll do
another picture together

34
00:38:30,249 --> 00:38:31,951
Toys!

35
00:41:58,499 --> 00:42:00,659
I'm not a puppet, I'm an artist!

36
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:02,953
Talkies are not serious"
for George Valentin"

37
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,371
We have to talk, George.

38
00:42:58,684 --> 00:43:01,095
Why do you refuse to talk?

39
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:32,585
I'm unhappy, George.

40
00:43:34,663 --> 00:43:37,631
So are millions of us.

41
00:44:50,338 --> 00:44:53,119
Your movie doesn't come out
until tomorrow and you're,

42
00:44:53,194 --> 00:44:55,794
already Hollywood's new sweetheart!
How do you explain that?

43
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:07,596
I don't know. Maybe because I talk
and the audience can understand me.

44
00:45:15,196 --> 00:45:18,249
People are tired of old actors mugging
at the camera...

45
00:45:18,324 --> 00:45:19,900
...to be understood.

46
00:45:35,846 --> 00:45:39,754
Out with the old, in with the new.
Make way for the young!

47
00:45:42,431 --> 00:45:44,216
That's life!

48
00:46:07,623 --> 00:46:09,617
I've made way for you.

49
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:50,157
STOCK MARKET CRASH

50
00:47:07,767 --> 00:47:10,594
It looks like we've gone bust.

51
00:47:19,946 --> 00:47:23,607
Unless the movie is a big hit...

52
00:52:02,436 --> 00:52:05,222
Hello. I wanted to
talk to you. I...

53
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:10,019
I just saw Tears of Love.

54
00:52:12,738 --> 00:52:15,357
And now want a refund?

55
00:52:22,761 --> 00:52:25,206
Not too much mugging?

56
00:52:33,764 --> 00:52:38,881
No. I'm sorry about last night.
I didn't mean what I said...

57
00:52:45,046 --> 00:52:48,307
But you were right.
Make way for the young...

58
00:53:02,205 --> 00:53:06,951
It's an honor to meet you.
My father is a big fan.

59
00:53:15,571 --> 00:53:18,477
Ok. We're going now.
I'll call you soon.

60
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,521
Take me home.
I want to be alone.

61
00:57:40,316 --> 00:57:43,936
How long has it been
since I last paid you, Clifton?

62
00:57:46,642 --> 00:57:48,719
One year, sir.

63
00:58:16,727 --> 00:58:19,952
You're fired.

64
00:58:33,786 --> 00:58:36,697
I'm not kidding, Clifton.
You're fired.

65
00:58:52,054 --> 00:58:55,383
Keep the car. And find
yourself another job.

66
00:59:00,271 --> 00:59:03,099
I don't want another job.

67
01:00:26,315 --> 01:00:30,186
TO-NIGHT AUCTION SALE
Famed Hollywood Actor: George Valentin

68
01:01:58,574 --> 01:02:01,402
Congratulations! It's all sold,
you've got nothing left!

69
01:07:04,714 --> 01:07:07,625
Excuse me, may
I trouble you one moment?

70
01:07:23,983 --> 01:07:26,727
If only he could talk!

71
01:08:21,342 --> 01:08:24,127
Look what you've become....

72
01:08:26,879 --> 01:08:30,708
You've been stupid!
You've been proud!

73
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:52,317
GET BACK HERE,
YOU LOSER!!!

74
01:13:01,529 --> 01:13:03,689
Oh my God! That's
George Valentin!

75
01:13:09,328 --> 01:13:11,072
I'll get my car!

76
01:13:17,879 --> 01:13:20,706
I'll say one thing, he
owes his life to that dog!

77
01:14:00,171 --> 01:14:03,082
We're ready. Go get
Miss Miller.

78
01:15:26,954 --> 01:15:30,741
He's out of danger.
He needs rest now.

79
01:15:43,316 --> 01:15:47,770
He was clutching this. It was
hard to get it away from him

80
01:16:25,316 --> 01:16:28,728
You think he could
rest at my house?

81
01:18:39,492 --> 01:18:43,612
I have to be on the set at nine o'clock.
We're shooting a very important scene.

82
01:19:24,412 --> 01:19:28,365
Just think of it! *Sparkle of Love*,
starring George Valentin and Peppy Miller!

83
01:19:47,066 --> 01:19:50,478
George is a silent movie
actor. He's a nobody now.

84
01:20:00,487 --> 01:20:02,772
What are you doing?

85
01:20:07,288 --> 01:20:09,740
I won't work anymore.
It's either him or me

86
01:20:20,551 --> 01:20:24,380
What I mean is, it's him AND
me! Or it's neither of us!

87
01:20:33,689 --> 01:20:36,767
Hey, I'm blackmailing
you! Get it?

88
01:21:05,556 --> 01:21:07,842
All right, send him
the damn screenplay.

89
01:21:47,025 --> 01:21:49,853
I work for Miss Miller now.

90
01:21:55,765 --> 01:21:57,842
Once again, she's
looking out for you.

91
01:22:31,349 --> 01:22:33,475
Beware of your pride, if I may say so sir.

92
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:35,761
Miss Miller is a good person, believe me.

93
01:32:58,935 --> 01:33:04,306
I feel so bad. I only wanted to
help you, take care of you...

94
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,970
If only you would let
me help you, George Valentin.

95
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:51,854
It's impossible, Peppy. I'm washed up.
No one wants to see me speak.

96
01:33:59,161 --> 01:34:02,406
There is one thing we
could try. Trust me.

97
01:36:15,395 --> 01:36:16,795
Cut!

98
01:36:17,576 --> 01:36:18,976
Perfect!

99
01:36:20,019 --> 01:36:21,219
Beautiful!

100
01:36:21,294 --> 01:36:23,494
Could you give me just one more.

101
01:36:24,410 --> 01:36:25,910
Always pleasure!

102
01:36:28,362 --> 01:36:30,362
- Back to one!
- OK. Back to one, guys.

103
01:36:30,437 --> 01:36:32,137
- Quiet please!
- Let's get ready.

104
01:36:40,873 --> 01:36:43,850
Again this advance, escorting Valentin.
Back in position guys, everybody.

105
01:36:43,925 --> 01:36:46,725
- Right, extras, come on in guys!
- That's good. That's good.

106
01:36:51,154 --> 01:36:54,054
First position, everybody.
Quiet please.

107
01:36:54,474 --> 01:36:56,174
Ready on your marks.

108
01:36:57,474 --> 01:36:59,474
Quiet. Hold your tongue.

109
01:37:07,503 --> 01:37:10,603
OK, let's do it guys.
Here we go, picture's up!

110
01:37:11,945 --> 01:37:15,065
- Here we go, and roll sound!
- Sound speed.

111
01:37:15,140 --> 01:37:16,768
- Roll camera!
- Camera speed.

112
01:37:16,843 --> 01:37:18,391
Silence please!

113
01:37:18,466 --> 01:37:19,366
And...

114
01:37:19,441 --> 01:37:20,441
action!
