1
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:26,592
BICYCLE THIEVES

2
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,854
Ricci?

3
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:39,864
Is Ricci here?

4
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:59,475
They called you.
Are you deaf? Come on!

5
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,526
So us bricklayers
should just starve?

6
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:18,636
There's nothing I can do.

7
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:21,864
Be patient.
We'll try to help everyone.

8
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:26,068
That's what I'm here for.
We'll see what we can do.

9
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,941
Ricci, there's a job for you.
- A job?

10
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,049
You'll be putting up posters.

11
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,185
Go to their office.

12
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,420
Take this letter
and your work permit.

13
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,456
- There's nothing for us?
- I'll be damned!

14
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,058
What about us?

15
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:44,287
I've just got jobs
for lathe operators.

16
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,727
So I should just rot?

17
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,231
What can I do?

18
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,926
Ricci, don't forget
to take your bicycle.

19
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:55,801
You need one.
It's says so on the slip, right?

20
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,636
My bicycle?

21
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,836
I have one...
but not at the moment.

22
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:05,747
I'll have it in a couple days.
- You need one now.

23
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:09,319
What's it matter?
I'll go on foot for a few days.

24
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:13,686
Listen, you got one or not?
If not, someone else gets the job.

25
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:18,728
- I have one!
- You're not the only one. I do too.

26
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,692
You're a bricklayer.
That's a different category.

27
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,301
- Then change it!
- I can't!

28
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,665
You have a bicycle or not?

29
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,501
Yes.
I'll report for work this morning.

30
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,008
No joking around.
If you don't have a bike, forget it.

31
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:37,149
And wait around here forever?
I'll get the bike.

32
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,977
- Cataldi!
- Here!

33
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:43,952
- Manual labor for two days.
- I'll take it.

34
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,789
Listen, I can't make up jobs!

35
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,805
Maria!

36
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:15,243
- What is it?
- Do I have rotten luck or what?

37
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,316
There's a job,
but I can't take it!

38
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:21,789
A job?
I don't understand.

39
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,394
What did you say?
Stop, Antonio.

40
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,088
What did you say?
A job?

41
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,699
And a good city job too!

42
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:38,938
It'll be all right.
Can't you work things out?

43
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:43,980
What's to work out?
I need my bicycle right now.

44
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,083
I have to start right away

45
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,913
or I lose the job.

46
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,954
- What can we do?
- Nothing.

47
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:58,859
- You should never have pawned it!
- What would you have eaten?

48
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,761
I curse the day I was born!
- Quiet.

49
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,266
I feel like jumping in the river!
- Quiet!

50
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,791
Get up.

51
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,736
- What are you doing?
- We can sleep without sheets.

52
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,315
There are six sheets there.

53
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,492
Linen and cotton.

54
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:37,459
Good stuff. From my dowry.
- They're used.

55
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:40,598
Not all of them.
Two are new.

56
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,267
How many pieces?

57
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,902
Six.
Three doubles, three singles.

58
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,731
That's three.

59
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,773
7,000 lira.

60
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,913
Couldn't you make it a bit more?

61
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,083
They're used.

62
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,417
All right.
Put these in here.

63
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,283
7,500.

64
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:08,786
Name?
- Maria Ricci.

65
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:13,295
Valmelaina.
Block H, Apartment 1.

66
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,355
It's a bicycle.

67
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,897
- 6, 100.
- Why?

68
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:52,667
- Interest. It's the 31st.
- Here.

69
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,508
It's the Fides.
Next to that red one.

70
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,239
I know, I know.

71
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,045
Wait a second.

72
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,132
Where's the man in charge?

73
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,830
Over there.

74
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,141
Put that down.
What are you afraid of?

75
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,776
Put that bike down.

76
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,611
Sorry.

77
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:17,880
My name is Antonio Ricci.

78
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:22,424
The employment office
in Valmelaina sent me.

79
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:34,934
You start in the morning. The storeroom
will give you what you need.

80
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:49,011
- Tomorrow at 6:45.
- I'll be there.

81
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,086
- How did it go?
- Good.

82
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,520
Sorry you had to wait,
but it's all set.

83
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,627
- What's this?
- There's a job for you too.

84
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,459
You have to tighten
the strap on my cap. It's loose.

85
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,266
Come look.

86
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,268
Everyone has his own locker.

87
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,605
See how big it is?

88
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,415
Just think: They used
to even provide shoes.

89
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,117
But the pay's still good.

90
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,557
6,000 bimonthly,
plus a family allowance.

91
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,199
And then there's overtime!

92
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:41,266
Can we stop
at Via della Paglia?

93
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,534
- What for?
- I have to see a woman.

94
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,939
- A woman?
- Yes, a woman.

95
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,715
Stop here a minute.

96
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,323
Who lives here?

97
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,257
I told you - a woman.
I'll just be a minute.

98
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,192
I'll be right back.

99
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,812
- Is it mine?
- No, it's mine.

100
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:35,056
That makes it five to three.

101
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,091
Concierge.

102
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,931
Excuse me.
Does the Holy One live here?

103
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:52,372
- The Holy One?
- The one who sees.

104
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,079
I don't know.

105
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,849
Let's try the second floor.

106
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:08,886
- Is the Holy One here?
- Yes, the last door.

107
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,811
Hey, kid, could you watch
the bike for a minute?

108
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,722
Last door.

109
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,793
February, March and April
have come and gone.

110
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,464
- How long has he been in bed?
- Over a year.

111
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:52,626
- You could have brought him.
- How? He can't move.

112
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,601
This one yes, that one no.

113
00:12:56,108 --> 00:13:00,408
Dear God, grant me your light.

114
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,606
Your son will rise from his bed
before the leaves fall.

115
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,081
Before the leaves fall?

116
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,617
Maria.

117
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:10,816
Come on.

118
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,990
Maria, let's go.

119
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,265
Come on.

120
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,963
What are you doing here?
- I owe her 50 lira.

121
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,003
Come on.
Don't be stupid.

122
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:31,768
She said you'd find a job.
I want to do my part.

123
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,708
- I'll come in and tell her what I think.
- All right, all right.

124
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:39,715
How can a woman with two children
and a head on her shoulders

125
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,446
listen to all this stupid nonsense?

126
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,385
I don't get it.

127
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,883
What are you doing now?

128
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,561
You must have money
to throw away.

129
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,492
I don't know what got into you.

130
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,396
Women!
Couldn't you spend it better?

131
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,571
I'm just grateful.

132
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,297
You think she got me the job?

133
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,135
Come on. Get on.

134
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,376
Let's go home, dummy.

135
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,352
Hurry, Bruno.
It's 6:30.

136
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,051
It's too dark in here
to clean it good.

137
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,738
- Daddy, look what they did.
- What?

138
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,175
- There's a dent.
- Maybe it was there.

139
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,781
No, they did it.

140
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:48,283
Who knows how they store them.
I'd have said something.

141
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,478
They don't pay for the repairs!

142
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,157
- Keep your voice down.
- All right.

143
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,327
But I'd have said something.

144
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,690
Is that cap ready?

145
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,699
- What did you make?
- Egg sandwiches.

146
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,908
Let me see. Wow!

147
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,947
- Handsome?
- You look like a cop!

148
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,217
Stop it!
You're hurting me!

149
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,452
Will you behave?
You'll wake the baby!

150
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,963
Here, Bruno.
An egg sandwich.

151
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,291
Let's go.

152
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,674
Bye, Mama.

153
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:03,952
See you tonight at 7:00.
Wait for me here.

154
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,062
Good morning.

155
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,868
First, you give it
a coat of glue.

156
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,507
Then you put up the poster.

157
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:10,517
Then another
light coat of glue,

158
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:14,557
flattening out the poster
and smoothing out the lumps.

159
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,057
Got that?

160
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,387
Beat it, kid!

161
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,463
If you leave any lumps,

162
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,659
the inspector will fine you.

163
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,838
You gotta be smart
to do this job.

164
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,442
You gotta have a good eye
and a quick hand.

165
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,376
There.

166
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,071
Let's go.

167
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,316
- See you, Ricci.
- Thanks.

168
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:47,949
Thief! Thief!

169
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,278
What happened?

170
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,164
Hop on!

171
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,337
After him, quick!

172
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,334
I saw him head for the tunnel!

173
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,541
Faster!

174
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,818
What's going on?

175
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,029
Well?

176
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,133
I was sure he came this way.

177
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,895
Yeah, sure he did.

178
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:06,482
Yes, there were people around,
but I had to go after him.

179
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,182
Falloni!

180
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,826
- What is it?
- Go to the meeting.

181
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,470
Capece's going.

182
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,506
Change in plans.
You and Quadrone are going.

183
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,682
Sign this.

184
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,911
Quadrone!
We're going to the meeting.

185
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,851
Hurry up there!

186
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:46,159
- Can you do something?
- Look yourself if you've got time.

187
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,162
Look all over Rome?

188
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,029
Well, I sure wouldn't recognize it.

189
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,396
I gave you the serial number
and a description.

190
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:58,474
Sure. It'd take the whole
mobile unit to look for it.

191
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,236
Then why even file a complaint?

192
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:05,207
Suppose you find it tomorrow
in a bike shop.

193
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,977
Call a policeman.
It's on file.

194
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,882
- Anything serious, Captain?
- Just a bicycle.

195
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,020
- Then it's up to me?
- I've already told you.

196
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,595
You filed your complaint.
Now good night.

197
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,817
Don't try cutting in line!

198
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:53,430
Excuse me,
but I was here first.

199
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:24,826
Bruno.

200
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,588
Daddy, it's 7:30.

201
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,323
I took the bus. Let's go.

202
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:35,065
Where's the bike?

203
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:03,099
- Did it break down?
- Yeah, it broke down.

204
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,489
You go inside.
I'll be back later.

205
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:30,594
Go on.

206
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,108
It's not about
the employment office.

207
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:53,216
Without work,
people can't be placed in jobs.

208
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:58,355
We've raised this issue
with the Department of Labor.

209
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,684
A welfare check solves nothing.

210
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:05,659
It just humiliates the worker
and doesn't help anything.

211
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,662
We need a massive program
of public works.

212
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,835
But what did they say
at today's meeting?

213
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:15,336
The same as always:
"You can't expect miracles".

214
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,304
- Is Baiocco here?
- Quiet back there.

215
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,267
It was him!

216
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:22,810
"You can be sure

217
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,539
we'll do our best
to find you jobs".

218
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,901
Ricci, I'm stealing your job.

219
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,401
I'll be right back.

220
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:30,036
- What are you doing here?
- I've got to talk to you.

221
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:33,012
- What is it?
- They stole my bicycle.

222
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,652
Son of a bitch!
Where?

223
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:39,119
At the Florida.
I was putting up posters.

224
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,985
How'd it happen?

225
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,023
You've got to help me.

226
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:47,865
I have to find that bike.

227
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,031
Easier said than done.

228
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:54,467
Excuse me. Baiocco, listen,
or we'll be here all night.

229
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,197
I'm listening.

230
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:01,342
If you really cared for me

231
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:02,877
Quiet, everyone!

232
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,515
You wouldn't let people tease me

233
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,184
I heard you.

234
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,051
You think I'm stupid?

235
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,684
Keep rehearsing.
I'll be right there.

236
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:25,898
Piazza Vittorio's your only hope,
and you gotta act quick.

237
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:30,541
They unload the stuff right away.
You just have to look there.

238
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,712
Antonio.

239
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,218
- Is it true?
- Don't start whining.

240
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:43,683
I purposely didn't go home
to avoid that.

241
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,448
Who's whining?

242
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:50,957
But this doesn't happen every day.
Did you do something?

243
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:53,062
Did you look for it?

244
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:57,132
Don't cry.
You look like a little girl.

245
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,136
We'll find it.

246
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:03,967
They'll swap some parts,
but it'll be on the market tomorrow.

247
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:07,906
And if it is,
we'll take it home, right?

248
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:12,573
You might not sleep so well tonight,
but we'll find it.

249
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,376
Don't worry.

250
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:19,046
Miss, would you care
to take a stroll with me?

251
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,020
No, I'm with my mother.

252
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:27,963
No! This is either
a rehearsal or a meeting.

253
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,566
You tell 'em, Meniconi.
- He's right.

254
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:39,436
Go home now.
We'll see what we can do.

255
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,407
- Until tomorrow then.
- Good night.

256
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,377
Remember what I said.
Good night.

257
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,547
Give her a little gas
or we'll never get out of here.

258
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,893
Get that cart out of the way.

259
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:07,689
Baiocco, we're here.

260
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:11,198
Meniconi and Bagonghi,
come here.

261
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:15,771
What make was it?
- A lightweight Fides, 1935 model.

262
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:18,169
He knows it better than me.

263
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:22,005
Good. That means we can split up.
They always take them apart.

264
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,773
Bagonghi, let's go this way.

265
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,178
No, this way is better.

266
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,718
You two look
at nothing but tires.

267
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,685
You look at frames.

268
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,985
Bruno, pumps and bells.
Let's go.

269
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,890
- It's a Fides frame.
- Got it.

270
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:47,064
We'll look for it piece by piece
and then put it back together.

271
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,873
Bagonghi, keep your eyes open.

272
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:56,474
There's only vegetables here.
We're not looking for that.

273
00:31:56,681 --> 00:32:00,913
We'll stroll
through the stands over there,

274
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:06,182
not letting on what we're doing.
Indifferent to everything.

275
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,051
They're setting up now.

276
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:21,836
- Just look at this!
- He'll find it, I'm sure!

277
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,531
This really gets my goat!

278
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:33,306
Remember, Bruno:
Pumps and bells.

279
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:36,851
If you see anything, whistle.

280
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,681
You know what to do.
You come with me.

281
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:45,122
Bruno, if we find it,
we'll celebrate.

282
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,658
Put that down.

283
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:01,703
Beat it, kid.

284
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,958
Keep your eyes peeled
for a Fides.

285
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:36,311
Looking to buy, dummy?

286
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:54,558
- Let me work, or I'll give you this!
- Just try it!

287
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:58,327
You cranky this morning or what?

288
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:02,131
I'm in no mood for this.
Beat it.

289
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,640
I was here first.
You wanna fight?

290
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,809
We can't all stick together.

291
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:13,381
Antonio, you look for the tires.

292
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:16,553
Bagonghi, the frame.
The kid'll look for the pump.

293
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:18,984
I'll look around on my own.

294
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,559
Take a look at this frame.

295
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:52,078
Yeah?

296
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,751
- What make is that?
- You buying?

297
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:57,318
Hands off.
The paint's still wet.

298
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,456
I have to see the serial number.

299
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:03,388
Why?
You buyin' serial numbers?

300
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:06,927
No, he's not.
Now just show him.

301
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:09,929
- And if I don't?
- Then I'll call a cop.

302
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:11,999
Go ahead!

303
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,669
You think it was stolen?

304
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:22,744
Who said anything?
But you have to show the number.

305
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:25,472
Do I ask to see
your shoe size? No!

306
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,651
And I don't show you
my frame numbers!

307
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:31,652
- You play the lottery with it?
- No, I don't.

308
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,915
Wouldn't you like a bell?

309
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,650
You've been here looking
for half an hour.

310
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:40,092
Shall I buy you this one?

311
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,691
How much is a bell?
- A hundred fifty lira.

312
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:48,599
Would you like it?
Just listen.

313
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:51,297
You filed your complaint.
You're covered.

314
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,807
Show him that frame.

315
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:58,379
Go ahead and look.
A man can't even work in peace.

316
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,549
Don't you trust me either?

317
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:09,024
12024.

318
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,922
Is it yours?

319
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,693
You got paint on you.

320
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,498
It's not a matter of trust.

321
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:20,398
A man who's been robbed
has a right to look.

322
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:22,232
Who's stopping you?

323
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,634
We all make mistakes.

324
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:40,520
Hey, buddy,

325
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:43,694
we're all honest here
in Piazza Vittorio!

326
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:49,165
Forget about him.

327
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:52,598
Just look for a Fides.
- What do you think I'm doing?

328
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:57,069
- Where's my son?
- He must be over by the carts.

329
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:01,268
- There's nothing more for us here.
- It's tough.

330
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:04,912
How about something else?

331
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,847
Stay with me.

332
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:09,485
Come on.

333
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:19,795
Antonio, take him to Porta Portese.
We'll keep looking here.

334
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:23,660
Our chances are better here.
It's too late for Porta Portese.

335
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,836
Go on now.

336
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,495
Go with him.

337
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,365
Careful.

338
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:07,275
You just can't win.

339
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,446
It rains every Sunday.

340
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:16,146
Sundays I'm off at 1:00,
and where can you go?

341
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:21,287
Movies bore me.
I just don't like 'em.

342
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:24,620
Look at this guy!
I ought to run him over!

343
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:27,389
Stupid jerk!

344
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:31,090
They jump out in front of you
and you end up in jail

345
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,930
before you even know
what's happened!

346
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:38,539
Look at this rain.

347
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:41,576
You just can't win.
It rains every Sunday.

348
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:29,178
What happened?

349
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:31,149
I fell down!

350
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:33,551
Wipe yourself off.

351
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,273
- You afraid of rain?
- Don't want to get my tux wet!

352
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,987
- A hundred lira?
- You're lucky to get that.

353
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:19,219
What can I do with this?

354
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:30,830
Stop him!

355
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,746
Stop him! Thief!

356
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:57,133
Bruno, let's find that old man!

357
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,975
There he is, Daddy!

358
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,402
Damn it!
Where did he go?

359
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:59,527
Bruno, where are you going?

360
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:25,649
Bruno!

361
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:27,824
What are you doing?
Come on!

362
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:44,330
Excuse me.
I want to ask you something.

363
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:47,999
That young man who was with you -
where can I find him?

364
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:49,201
What young man?

365
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,904
He talked to you
and then rode off on a bike.

366
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:55,574
- Why? What did he do to you?
- Nothing.

367
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:57,913
It's an urgent private matter.

368
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:01,353
What can I tell you?
I don't know him.

369
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:03,822
You were together
under the arches!

370
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:07,155
There are lots of young men
under the arches.

371
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:12,393
Wait a second.
I have to talk to him.

372
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,037
Let me go!
Leave me alone, kid.

373
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:18,902
I'm just an old man
who minds his own business,

374
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:22,101
and what do I get? Trouble.

375
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:45,660
It's late! You're supposed
to be here by 10:00.

376
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:49,805
- They said you were always open.
- Go on now.

377
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:09,156
- What about lunch?
- Later. You need a mess kit.

378
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:14,319
You first-timers, take your mess kits
out into the courtyard.

379
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:18,467
Go ahead now.
There's no time to lose.

380
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:27,240
Line them up neatly,
not like last time.

381
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:30,436
Each of you will come pick up

382
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:32,740
your own mess kit later.

383
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:37,520
Maybe I should get a shave.

384
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:42,053
You need a shave?
Then come inside.

385
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:45,428
Sit down.

386
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,834
Go inside.

387
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:56,028
Will you be much longer, Counselor?
- No, just these two.

388
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,434
No, not me.

389
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:59,836
Then we can begin.

390
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:10,684
Don't shave my chin.
I'm letting it grow there.

391
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,115
Hurry, the priest's waiting.

392
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:14,950
That's enough now, Counselor.

393
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:17,183
You need another barber.

394
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,362
Come with me, little boy.

395
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,417
Move over, would you?

396
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:41,801
I have to find that young man.
It's a personal matter.

397
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:44,037
I have to talk to him.

398
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:49,345
Will you tell me
where I can find him?

399
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:51,646
Just leave me alone.

400
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:54,016
I don't know
what you're talking about.

401
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,792
Page six.

402
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:06,261
"May I leave this holy place...

403
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:14,434
with my soul purified..."

404
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:22,814
There's money in it for him.
Where is he?

405
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:27,150
- I don't have to say.
- You do too, or I'll get the police.

406
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,951
What have I done to you?
Leave me alone.

407
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,092
Lay off.

408
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:39,201
"Though I may travel once more
the path of sorrow and hardship..."

409
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:42,000
Just tell me where he is.

410
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,934
What can you lose?

411
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:46,132
I've got nothing against you.

412
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:49,574
In fact, I'm prepared to pay.

413
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,812
- What's for lunch?
- Pasta and potatoes.

414
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,288
Will you tell me?

415
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:04,560
Jail is worse, you know.
You'll rot there.

416
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:08,894
Where is he?
- All right. Via della Campanella.

417
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,429
What number?

418
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:14,966
Ah, for chrissake!

419
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:17,670
I think it's No. 15.

420
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:23,308
- You're coming with me.
- Go by yourself.

421
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:26,573
No! You come with me
or I call the police!

422
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:29,750
I'm tired of begging you!
You got that?

423
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:32,888
Quiet, or I'll have you thrown out!

424
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,298
Are you coming?

425
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:48,596
I'm not going anywhere.

426
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:51,467
- What have you got to lose?
- Go away!

427
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:54,644
- I'm losing my patience.
- Lose whatever you like.

428
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:58,212
Goddamn it!
Come along or I'm going to the police.

429
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:01,213
Do whatever the hell you like.

430
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:04,747
You're coming with me, you hear?

431
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:10,489
Leave me alone
or you'll be sorry.

432
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:12,857
Come on, let's go!

433
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:15,964
I'm not going anywhere.

434
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:18,930
- I'll show you. Come on!
- Leave me alone!

435
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:29,775
- At least let me get my lunch first.
- I'm going with you.

436
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,948
Just when I can get
a decent meal!

437
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:35,377
Stop them.

438
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:38,315
- Where are you going?
- To get this man's lunch.

439
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:03,236
Did a man come this way?

440
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:07,883
No, and we're not ready yet.
Girls, more over here.

441
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:10,947
Not so much there.

442
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:16,454
Just what do you want?

443
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,027
- I want to get out!
- It's locked, and the lawyer has the key!

444
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:24,496
Stop making such a racket!
You're in church!

445
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:31,570
Will you please just leave?

446
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:37,339
This is no way to behave in church!
Come with me!

447
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:43,118
Stop!

448
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,754
I have to find him.
I know he's here.

449
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:59,161
Did you come to hear mass
or make trouble?

450
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:01,804
Just what do you want?

451
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:05,839
I told you:
I'm looking for an old man!

452
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,018
I've got to find him!

453
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:20,713
Where do you think you're going?

454
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,721
He came this way!

455
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:32,163
- Who knows where he's gone now.
- That's enough!

456
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:41,742
He didn't just fly away.

457
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:47,713
Why'd you let him
go for his lunch?

458
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:49,976
Would you shut up!

459
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:58,489
Where are you going?
Come back here.

460
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:00,560
Come on!

461
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:04,258
You coming or not?
- No!

462
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,463
Let's go!

463
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:09,639
Some kid I have!
Come on!

464
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,865
- Why did you hit me?
- You asked for it.

465
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:16,375
Let's go.
- No. You go alone.

466
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:18,513
Will you come on?

467
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:25,011
Little troublemaker.

468
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:31,420
You're a little nag.
- I'm gonna tell Mama.

469
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:34,096
We'll settle this at home.

470
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:41,330
Wait for me by the bridge,
you hear?

471
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,108
I'm gonna look for the old man.

472
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:17,272
Help! A boy's drowning!

473
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:35,106
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, he's fine.

474
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:01,874
Bruno, put on your jacket.
You'll catch a chill.

475
00:58:02,078 --> 00:58:03,739
Go ahead.

476
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:07,983
Come on.

477
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:12,915
Put it on.

478
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:27,126
You tired?

479
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:30,562
Sit down for a minute.

480
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:33,640
Not much we can do now
but go home.

481
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,470
Sit down.

482
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:45,452
Go, Modena!

483
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:51,523
Is Modena a good team?

484
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,263
You hungry?

485
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:11,740
How about a pizza?

486
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:21,884
Let's go.

487
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:26,159
Why kill myself worrying
when I'll end up just as dead anyway?

488
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:28,262
Come on.

489
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:47,742
Sit down.

490
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:54,118
Let's forget everything
and get drunk!

491
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:56,856
Waiter.

492
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:00,520
Arrigo, help this gentleman.

493
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:04,590
A half bottle?

494
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:07,429
- A full bottle and a pizza.
- We don't serve pizza.

495
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:10,367
- You don't?
- This isn't a pizzeria.

496
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,569
- We want to eat.
- Eat?

497
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:15,073
- Yeah, eat!
- What do you want?

498
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,777
You want a mozzarella sandwich?

499
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:24,244
Two mozzarella sandwiches
and a full bottle.

500
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:28,649
There'll be dessert later too.
How about that?

501
01:00:57,787 --> 01:01:00,620
What's the matter? Drink.

502
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:06,095
If your mother saw me
giving you wine!

503
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:11,733
But we can do as we like.

504
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:17,973
You can explain it this way

505
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:21,007
Or explain it that way

506
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:24,873
Call him Ciccio or Antonio
Beppe or Ciro

507
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:28,812
He's still a little black child
How could that have happened

508
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,168
Let's just eat and enjoy.

509
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:56,736
There's a cure for everything...

510
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,711
except death.

511
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:42,658
To eat like them,

512
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:46,056
you'd have to earn
a million lira a month.

513
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:53,563
Eat, eat. Don't worry.

514
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:56,796
You like it?

515
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:15,182
Things were going great.

516
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:19,221
With overtime, I figured -

517
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:22,656
I'll show you.

518
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,899
12,000 a month salary.

519
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:37,235
Here, you write it down.

520
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:42,710
12,000 salary...

521
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:48,252
plus 2,000 overtime...

522
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:50,982
plus the family allowance.

523
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:54,920
Altogether, 800 a day.

524
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:58,596
Thirty times 800 - just imagine.

525
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:02,336
What more could you ask?

526
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:06,372
And I should just kiss it good-bye?
Well, I won't.

527
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:10,876
See now why we have to find it?
Otherwise we don't eat.

528
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,707
What can we do?

529
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:16,146
We'll go to the Porta Portese
every day.

530
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:18,820
We'll find those guys there.

531
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,318
Yeah, sure.

532
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,992
Those guys are long gone.

533
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:28,024
We'd never find them
with all your mother's candles

534
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:30,859
or all the saints in the world.

535
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:42,374
Sports news.
Just like every Sunday,

536
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:47,641
soccer teams throughout Italy
will play their scheduled matches today.

537
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:52,521
Of course, fans are excited
about the championship series.

538
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,747
Teams scheduled to play today...

539
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,359
Last door.

540
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:12,202
I'm afraid of what she might say.

541
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:17,038
Don't be afraid. Tell her everything,
like you would your confessor.

542
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:22,309
I just hope you're right.
O holy Mother of God!

543
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:32,055
This one yes, that one no.

544
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:35,196
Sow in some other field.

545
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:38,799
You understand what I mean?

546
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:40,229
No, I don't.

547
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:42,927
How can you not understand,
dear boy?

548
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:45,198
It's simple.

549
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:49,811
What good is sowing seeds
if the soil is unreceptive?

550
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:53,709
You plant,
but you harvest nothing.

551
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:55,747
Understand?

552
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:00,054
No, I really don't.

553
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:03,515
She doesn't love you!
Forget about her!

554
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:09,929
My dear boy,
you're very ugly.

555
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:13,262
Very ugly.

556
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,870
There are so many other women.

557
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:20,941
Sow your seeds in a different field.
Will you do that?

558
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:28,216
Mama, it's getting cold.

559
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:36,421
Good day.

560
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,528
Daddy, come on!

561
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:49,261
There's room now!

562
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:53,901
You have to wait your turn.

563
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:58,809
Excuse me,
but we've been waiting for hours.

564
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,984
- Why don't you wait your turn?
- I'm in a hurry.

565
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:05,176
Well, so are we.

566
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:08,016
Please understand,
I beg of you.

567
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:11,090
Behave yourselves.

568
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:13,725
Behave yourselves!

569
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:18,090
These ladies are first,
and then me.

570
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,325
Stop arguing!

571
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:23,767
I shed my light on all.

572
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:26,032
This one yes, that one no.

573
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,144
Dear God, grant me your light.

574
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:33,304
Grant me your light.

575
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:37,145
What is it?

576
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:43,121
What?

577
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,329
They stole what?
- My bicycle.

578
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:50,396
Your bicycle?

579
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:52,760
What can I say, my son?

580
01:07:52,968 --> 01:07:55,596
I can only tell you what I see.

581
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:57,432
Listen carefully.

582
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:02,100
Either you find it right away
or you never will. Understand?

583
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:07,476
Either you find it right away,
or you'll never see it again.

584
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:09,674
Find it right away?
But where?

585
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:12,752
I don't know
what else to tell you.

586
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:15,219
Go now,
and try to understand.

587
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:18,791
Find it right away
or you never will.

588
01:08:39,014 --> 01:08:40,777
Adele, what is it today?

589
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:42,814
My husband's still drinking.

590
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:45,680
It's your cross to bear.
Stop giving him money.

591
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:49,051
What can I do?
He takes it.

592
01:09:46,982 --> 01:09:49,416
We're closed!
The ladies are having lunch!

593
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:52,644
Closed means closed
for everyone!

594
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:56,714
Look here!
And with a kid too!

595
01:09:56,926 --> 01:09:59,724
Don't you see
you can't come in?

596
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:02,796
Get out!
You can't go in!

597
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:04,727
Where's he gone to now?

598
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:08,165
Get out of here!

599
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,065
Where's he gone?

600
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:15,300
Closed means closed
for everybody!

601
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:19,845
- Where is he?
- How would I know? There he is!

602
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:23,018
You can't go in the rooms!

603
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,449
- Let me go!
- Scoundrel!

604
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:28,817
That's the dining room!
Get out of here!

605
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:35,494
Get out!
- I want to talk to him.

606
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:37,461
I don't even know you.

607
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:40,260
Well, you will.
Step outside.

608
01:10:40,469 --> 01:10:43,165
Someone call the police!

609
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:45,740
Stop shouting.
I've got a headache.

610
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:48,068
- I want to talk to you!
- Me?

611
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:50,370
- Don't talk to him.
- Shut up.

612
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:53,207
You want me?
Here I am.

613
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:58,251
- Give me my bike back!
- Get your hands off me!

614
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:09,324
You ruined everything for me!

615
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:13,262
Get your hands off me!
I'm not afraid of you!

616
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:22,734
This is the finest house in Rome.
If the police chief should find out -

617
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:26,042
Outside with you,

618
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:29,115
and don't ever come back!

619
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:34,051
Well, what do you want?

620
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:39,589
- Give me back what you stole!
- What did I steal?

621
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:44,164
Look at this guy!
What did I steal of yours?

622
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:46,098
My bicycle!

623
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:49,965
What bicycle?
I'm no thief.

624
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:56,969
- You're not going anywhere.
- Leave me alone or I'll flatten you!

625
01:11:58,213 --> 01:12:00,807
I'll kill you
if you don't give it back!

626
01:12:01,016 --> 01:12:03,951
I'm not leaving here
until you give it back!

627
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:07,589
Look at this crazy man!
Leave me alone.

628
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:09,257
Get your hands off me!

629
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:13,224
I didn't do anything.
You're trying to set me up.

630
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:16,091
I'm not leaving
until you give back what you stole.

631
01:12:16,298 --> 01:12:18,766
You stole my bike yesterday

632
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:20,491
at the Florida!

633
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:22,933
I wasn't even there yesterday!

634
01:12:23,138 --> 01:12:25,766
You were there with this cap!

635
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:30,274
- You can't just accuse people!
- Get some glasses!

636
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:34,608
- Leave me alone.
- No, I won't! You got that?

637
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:37,012
Alfredo!
What's that scoundrel want?

638
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:38,880
He won't let me go.

639
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:42,353
Hands off! I was
at the general market yesterday.

640
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,389
Are you crazy?

641
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:55,099
You say this man here
stole your bicycle?

642
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:56,703
Yes, he did.

643
01:12:56,905 --> 01:13:00,568
- You're sure it was him?
- Of course I am!

644
01:13:00,776 --> 01:13:03,711
- Where do you claim he stole it?
- Near the Florida.

645
01:13:03,912 --> 01:13:07,370
Why not go to the police?
He lives right here.

646
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:11,576
Get the police.
Go ahead.

647
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:14,620
What are you waiting for?

648
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:17,719
Get the police.
I've got nothing to hide.

649
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:20,827
You're not going anywhere,
you hear?

650
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:23,463
Don't touch me!

651
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:25,860
Get him off me!

652
01:13:32,007 --> 01:13:35,067
- You'd better go.
- Look what you've done.

653
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:39,646
- Be sure before you accuse someone.
- You won't get away with this.

654
01:13:39,848 --> 01:13:43,750
His head!
Don't let him hit his head!

655
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:52,024
You better go.
And next time, be sure first!

656
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:56,664
Besides getting a good beating,
you could be sued for libel.

657
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:04,499
Get him out of here
or I'll kill him!

658
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:08,233
My boy!
Mama's pride and joy!

659
01:14:08,644 --> 01:14:11,670
- Just go, will you?
- Get your hands off me!

660
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,871
Get your facts straight next time!

661
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:19,315
You already lost your bike, stupid!
Want to lose your wallet too?

662
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,884
Cowards,
ganging up on one man!

663
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:26,424
You're all thieves!

664
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:31,559
- Are you crazy!
- Just trying to cool that guy down!

665
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:44,712
Where's this bicycle fellow?

666
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:49,315
There he is,
putting on a show.

667
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:54,285
What show?
Can't you see he's half dead?

668
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:57,618
- Where do you live?
- Right there. I've got nothing to hide.

669
01:14:57,826 --> 01:15:01,421
You can't accuse my son!
He's got a clean record!

670
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:04,224
They'll all tell you!

671
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:06,333
Just because he wears
a German cap.

672
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:09,368
Isn't my cap German too?

673
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:12,404
- Get up.
- You can't move him!

674
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:15,406
Officer, he's very sick.

675
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:17,135
Then take me to your house.

676
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:19,246
For heaven's sake...

677
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:24,216
we're honest people.
Come and see.

678
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:26,948
Come.

679
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,625
I'd sue you for slander.

680
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:37,321
That boy's never hurt a flea.

681
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:48,007
See for yourself.
Four of us live in this one room.

682
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:55,342
Here's his bed.
See any bicycles under here?

683
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,952
My two other kids and I
all sleep there.

684
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:06,755
Instead of insulting my poor boy,
you should give him a job.

685
01:16:06,962 --> 01:16:10,090
He's always looking for one,
bless his soul.

686
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:18,168
Those belong
to my brother-in-law.

687
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:22,139
He used to have a car.

688
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:28,907
Sure, look under the bed.

689
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:31,984
You see any bicycles?

690
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:41,624
Listen.

691
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:47,391
Can anyone testify on your behalf?
- I'll testify.

692
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,070
You?

693
01:16:54,242 --> 01:16:56,437
Could you step outside?

694
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:02,116
Take all day for all I care.

695
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:07,718
You could be mistaken.
You sure you recognize him?

696
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:10,619
Of course I'm sure.

697
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:12,560
Come here.

698
01:17:13,762 --> 01:17:15,320
See all of them?

699
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:27,367
They'll all testify for him.
I see it every day.

700
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:31,512
Did you see his face?
- Yes, as he took off with it.

701
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:33,476
So you saw his back.

702
01:17:33,682 --> 01:17:36,674
No, I saw his face, because -

703
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:41,348
- Were there other people around?
- Yes.

704
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:44,457
Did you get the names
of any witnesses?

705
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:47,390
I couldn't stop to get names.

706
01:17:47,596 --> 01:17:49,496
Then you're out of luck.

707
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:21,053
You didn't get a good look at his face,
and you have no witnesses.

708
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:24,061
Maybe you're right,
but you have no proof.

709
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:26,933
And if he is innocent,
you're in trouble.

710
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:30,627
You have to catch
these characters red-handed.

711
01:18:30,839 --> 01:18:32,466
I'll smash his face in!

712
01:18:32,674 --> 01:18:34,904
Then I'd have to arrest you.

713
01:18:36,511 --> 01:18:39,639
If you only knew
what this means to me.

714
01:18:48,123 --> 01:18:49,613
Come here.

715
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:54,795
I feel better.
I can go with you now.

716
01:18:54,996 --> 01:18:57,521
What did you find? Nothing!

717
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:00,099
I've got a clean record.

718
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:03,100
- What's your name?
- Alfredo Catelli.

719
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:05,398
You want to press charges?

720
01:19:05,607 --> 01:19:08,804
My son's got a clean record.

721
01:19:10,645 --> 01:19:13,876
That's right.
You'd better just leave.

722
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:19,944
Send us a postcard!

723
01:19:24,025 --> 01:19:26,516
Coming around here
to accuse people!

724
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:37,298
Bruno, come on.

725
01:19:55,157 --> 01:19:57,455
Don't come around here again.

726
01:23:45,387 --> 01:23:49,016
Bruno, take the streetcar.
Wait at Monte Sacro.

727
01:23:53,828 --> 01:23:55,955
You heard me! Go on!

728
01:24:31,599 --> 01:24:32,998
Thief!

729
01:24:33,201 --> 01:24:35,169
Stop him! Thief!

730
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:38,733
Stop that guy!

731
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:17,605
Trying to ruin everything,
are you?

732
01:25:17,812 --> 01:25:21,680
This bike is all I have!

733
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:27,144
You're going to jail!

734
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:34,060
Beat it, kid!

735
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:09,928
- Where to?
- The police station.

736
01:26:10,131 --> 01:26:15,433
We can't all go.
Pasquale and I will take him.

737
01:26:20,708 --> 01:26:24,542
- Forget it. Let him go.
- Just like that?

738
01:26:24,746 --> 01:26:27,510
I don't want trouble.
Thanks for your help.

739
01:26:28,049 --> 01:26:31,815
You're a fine example for your son.
You should be ashamed.

740
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:36,013
You got off easy.
If it were me, you'd go to jail.

741
01:26:36,224 --> 01:26:39,284
Go home now.
Beat it!

742
01:26:39,494 --> 01:26:41,519
Get out of here!

743
01:26:42,263 --> 01:26:45,255
And you can thank God.
