00:00:57,356 --> 00:00:59,758
Boys, let's go.

3
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,426
Come on, tighten up.

4
00:01:03,428 --> 00:01:05,396
Single file, gentlemen.

5
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,431
Center of the hall.

6
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:09,032
- Come on, tighten it up.
- <i>Condition unit one!</i>

7
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:10,669
Condition unit one, copy that.

8
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:13,237
On the ground. Show me hands, let's go.

9
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,538
Hands!

10
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,076
<i>Code blue! Fight in progress!</i>

11
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:43,566
Come on, let's fight, man! Let him go!

12
00:01:43,568 --> 00:01:46,906
At least let me get my shoes.

13
00:01:58,984 --> 00:02:00,684
Mary Anne.

14
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:02,753
Hello.

15
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:04,790
Thank you.

16
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,559
Adonis got into a fight today,

17
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:10,160
and he's in holding.

18
00:02:10,162 --> 00:02:13,597
If you wanna see him, we're
gonna have to go up there.

19
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,266
He's a good kid, he just...

20
00:02:16,268 --> 00:02:18,836
Fights.

21
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:21,441
All the time.

22
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,183
- Johnson?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,620
- Right this way.
- Thanks.

24
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,870
Johnson, got a visitor.

25
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,376
Adonis.

26
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:04,315
Come on in.

27
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,184
I'd like you to meet Mrs...

28
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,719
Uh...

29
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:12,324
Could we have a moment, please?

30
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,058
Sure.

31
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,996
I'll be right outside.

32
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,076
Why were you fighting?

33
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,579
I'm not going to another group home.

34
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:37,714
I'm not from a group home.

35
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:39,516
You a social worker?

36
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:41,486
No.

37
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:44,824
I am not a social worker.

38
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:53,900
Nigga said something about
my ma so I beat his ass.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,736
I'm sorry about your mother.

40
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,909
I know what it's like to lose someone.

41
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:08,345
When your father died,
I was angry for so long.

42
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:11,516
I hurt myself, pushed family away.

43
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,885
I don't have no father.

44
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,253
What did you say?

45
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,555
I said I don't have no father.

46
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,426
That's not true.

47
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:26,499
He passed before you were
born, but you had a father.

48
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:30,702
You knew him?

49
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:37,142
He was my husband.

50
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,676
Adonis, I would like it very much

51
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:42,647
if you would come and stay with me.

52
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,788
Do you think you'd wanna do that?

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,002
What was his name?

54
00:07:54,606 --> 00:07:55,806
Hey, James.

55
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,743
Don, sit down.

56
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,216
What you got there?

57
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:12,156
You're joking, right?

58
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,392
You get a promotion and you're quitting?

59
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:18,161
Look, this career just ain't for me.

60
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:20,399
What are you gonna do?

61
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:25,437
Hey, man, thanks for everything.

62
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,053
<i>Just wanna talk to you about my job.</i>

63
00:08:44,055 --> 00:08:46,256
- You see your new office?
- Hmm.

64
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:48,592
Yeah. But, um...

65
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,428
Well, what's it like?

66
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,664
This is a big deal, this promotion.

67
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,868
Did they hire your assistant?

68
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,639
Thank you.

69
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:04,610
Very proud of you.

70
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:22,427
<i>Superfight Two with Rocky
Balboa, the challenger</i>

71
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:25,263
<i>and, of course, Apollo
Creed, the world champion.</i>

72
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:26,898
<i>And there's the bell.</i>

73
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,231
<i>Comes over in a hurry now.</i>

74
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:30,235
<i>He throws a couple of
rights and lefts out there.</i>

75
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,303
<i>He starts to take command early here</i>

76
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:35,505
<i>and now he kinda moves his feet
along the side of the ring.</i>

77
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:37,040
<i>A good right hand thrown at him.</i>

78
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:39,544
<i>Another right and another
right thrown by the champion.</i>

79
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:40,977
<i>Creed is going for the knockout.</i>

80
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:43,414
<i>Just holding that right hand
and he's just waiting for that</i>

81
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,715
<i>precise moment that he wants...</i>

82
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:48,052
<i>There it is! He unloaded
that. But here comes Balboa!</i>

83
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,187
<i>Got him in that corner, and
there's lefts and rights.</i>

84
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,755
<i>Here comes Balboa coming back out.</i>

85
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,156
<i>A left and a right to the head.</i>

86
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:54,991
<i>But now it is Creed coming back.</i>

87
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:57,928
<i>Creed with the left hand.</i>

88
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,699
<i>Balboa appears to be
getting hit often.</i>

89
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,143
Take it to him. Take it to the body.

90
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,211
There you go!

91
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,579
Make your time count, baby.

92
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:20,451
You know what's coming up. There you go.

93
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,919
Check it out.

94
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:24,722
What you doing here, man?

95
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,091
15 and 0, 15 knockouts.

96
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,461
In Tijuana? No, bro.

97
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,295
That's barroom brawling.

98
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:33,997
Well, I'm all in anyway.

99
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:35,265
So I figure we start out local,

100
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,399
just to get our momentum going,

101
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:37,701
then we can move wherever we wanna move.

102
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,404
- "We"?
- I was figuring...

103
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:42,939
Adonis, these boys come in
here, this how they survive.

104
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:44,408
They gotta fight for life.

105
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,144
Kill or be killed. People die in there.

106
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,879
Your daddy died in the ring.

107
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,280
This ain't no joke.

108
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,548
I don't know him.

109
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,550
Ain't got nothing to do with me.

110
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:56,287
- Okay, you real tough now.
- Yup.

111
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:59,289
Nah, I ain't training you.

112
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,292
You know I ain't training
you. Nobody training you.

113
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,495
I'm gonna make sure about that.

114
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,765
We making champs in the Delphi Gym!

115
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:08,966
We not dancing!

116
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,001
We not singing! We fighting!

117
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,670
You struggle every day,
you fight for something.

118
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,707
You damn right!

119
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:19,610
Hey, listen up!

120
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,946
Adonis.

121
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,813
These the keys to my 'Stang right here.

122
00:11:23,815 --> 00:11:25,082
Adonis, get out the ring!

123
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,850
All you gotta do is
land one clean head shot.

124
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,355
What I gotta put up for it?

125
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:35,826
Put up your hands. You a pro, right?

126
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,061
No, no, no.

127
00:11:38,063 --> 00:11:39,597
You gonna get the shit knocked out of you.

128
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,564
You ain't gotta prove nothing to me.

129
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:43,868
Better listen to your family, boy.

130
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,071
Oh, my God.

131
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,573
At least put on your head gear.

132
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:50,875
- No head gear?
- Mmm-hmm.

133
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,611
It's on you.

134
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,712
Killer, right?

135
00:11:56,714 --> 00:11:59,549
He a killer, right, Lil Duke?

136
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:01,751
Where were you at when I
was in group homes, huh?

137
00:12:01,753 --> 00:12:03,120
You miss a meal?

138
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,221
Nah!

139
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,755
Which one of your killers in here next?

140
00:12:05,757 --> 00:12:08,159
You pick him! You pick who's next!

141
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,496
I'm next.

142
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,207
Hey, I just need one round, bro.

143
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,009
All right, you wanna warm up?

144
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:27,880
I don't need no warm-up. Get my stuff.

145
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:33,516
I see you got your head gear on. Good job.

146
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,323
Nah.

147
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,866
Don't run.

148
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,894
Told you I'd win, man.

149
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,361
I told you.

150
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:19,730
I tried to tell you something, bro.

151
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,130
You don't wanna listen.

152
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:22,866
You don't wanna listen.

153
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,535
You wanna learn things the hard way, huh?

154
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:39,116
- Hey.
- Hey.

155
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,084
How you doing?

156
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,586
Doing good.

157
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,489
I just came home, I wanted to talk to you.

158
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,823
Yeah?

159
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:50,193
I quit my job.

160
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:52,196
Yeah. No...

161
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:59,470
Where did you get this? Mexico?

162
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:00,638
It's not that bad.

163
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,006
"It's not that bad."

164
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:05,943
I ought to knock you out myself.

165
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,578
You know how many times I had to
carry your father up these stairs

166
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,914
- because he couldn't walk?
- Yes.

167
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,149
How many times I had to wipe his ass

168
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,518
because he couldn't use his hands?

169
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,886
Is that what you want? No.

170
00:14:16,888 --> 00:14:19,523
You want brain damage. Yeah, you do.

171
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,759
You want to be so brain-damaged,
you can't form a sentence.

172
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:22,959
I can get hurt doing anything.

173
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:24,928
Apollo didn't get hurt, he got killed!

174
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,030
People get killed!

175
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,799
I didn't take you in
for you to go backwards.

176
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:31,769
You're better than this.

177
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:34,006
I'm leaving soon.

178
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,877
I'm gonna be fighting full-time now.

179
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,215
So I wanted to tell
you face-to-face.

180
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,619
You are your father's son

181
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,722
and you're part of him.

182
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,694
But it doesn't mean you have to be him.

183
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,363
I'm gonna call you.

184
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:05,404
Listen, you want to be
in somebody's ring...

185
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,675
You don't have to call me.

186
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:55,052
All right, smile!

187
00:16:36,728 --> 00:16:39,663
How you doing?

188
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,332
This was taken from the 10th
round of the first fight, right?

189
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:45,369
Good call.

190
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,804
How'd you know that?

191
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,841
I heard about a third fight
between you and Apollo,

192
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,009
behind closed doors.

193
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:54,845
That true?

194
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,114
How'd you hear about that?

195
00:16:57,116 --> 00:17:00,049
Who won?

196
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:03,320
It's kind of a secret.
What'd you say your name was?

197
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,721
Donnie.

198
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,123
The girl said you wanted
to talk about something.

199
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,824
Yeah, I want to talk to
you about training me.

200
00:17:08,826 --> 00:17:11,161
Training you.

201
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,663
I don't do that stuff no
more. Sorry about that.

202
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,299
Listen, it's getting kind of late, kid.

203
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,735
So I'm gonna close up.

204
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,937
How good was he?

205
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,939
Who? Apollo? Yeah, he was great.

206
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,342
He's a perfect fighter.
Ain't nobody ever better.

207
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,944
So how'd you beat him?

208
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,144
Time beat him.

209
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:31,715
Time, you know, takes
everybody out, it's undefeated.

210
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,083
Anyway, I gotta lock up.

211
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,552
When Mickey died, he came
and talked to you, right?

212
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,521
Talked you out of quitting?

213
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,690
Took you to L.A., trained you.

214
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,893
Brought you back.

215
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,534
How do you know all this?

216
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,104
How do you think?

217
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:58,941
What are you, like a cousin?

218
00:17:58,943 --> 00:18:01,644
He's my father.

219
00:18:01,646 --> 00:18:03,979
No, he isn't. I don't believe you.

220
00:18:03,981 --> 00:18:05,247
Call Mary Anne.

221
00:18:05,249 --> 00:18:06,615
Mary Anne. His wife.

222
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:09,586
The house number still works.

223
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,488
Oh, that's right.

224
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,256
You haven't talked to
her since the funeral.

225
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,527
She said you gave a nice speech, though.

226
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:30,107
Yeah.

227
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,842
Nice speech.

228
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:35,111
I want you to train me.

229
00:18:35,113 --> 00:18:38,215
All right? I need somebody solid
and who else better to go to?

230
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:41,685
You at least owe me that.

231
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:46,122
I can tell the way you
talk, you been to school.

232
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:48,992
So I figure you got some brains.

233
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,794
Why would you want to pick a fighter's life

234
00:18:51,796 --> 00:18:52,929
when you don't have to?

235
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,799
If Apollo was around, he
would tell you that, too.

236
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,167
Well, he ain't around.

237
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,603
I been fighting my whole
life. I ain't got a choice.

238
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:03,306
It's always about a choice.

239
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,674
I was in the ring.

240
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,043
I saw how it went down.

241
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:07,611
That fight should've been stopped.

242
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,246
I should have stopped it.

243
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:12,216
Maybe he wanted to go out like a fighter.

244
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:15,118
Maybe, you did exactly what he wanted.

245
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,491
I think he'd rather be
here, talking with you.

246
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,841
There is a resemblance.

247
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:43,680
I'm usually here all the time,

248
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,748
so if you're ever in the
neighborhood, come by,

249
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,051
if you need something.

250
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,018
I'll be at Mickey's Gym tomorrow.

251
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,556
I don't go there. I haven't
been there in a long time.

252
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:57,694
Since we're pretty much like family

253
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,165
who won the third fight?

254
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:05,002
He did.

255
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:33,863
<i>In boxing,</i>

256
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,765
<i>fighters' origins can endure</i>

257
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,636

258
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:43,239

259

<i>"Pretty" Ricky Conlan is a

260
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:51,982

261
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:55,584
<i>But for the undefeated best
pound-for-pound boxer in the world,</i>

262
00:20:55,586 --> 00:20:58,688

with uncertainty,</i>

263
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,391
<i>with a seven-year
prison sentence looming.</i>

264
00:21:02,393 --> 00:21:05,661
I didn't plan on spending me
prime years in a prison cell.

265
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,730
<i>I hate letting me family down.</i>

266

Conlan's going away for a long time.

276
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,729
Now it's my turn.

277
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,098
I've never lost.

278
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,501
I've never even been knocked
down, and that's not gonna change.

<i>A champion in a dark and

00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:35,419
No respect, man.

284
00:22:57,575 --> 00:22:59,543
I'm Donnie.

285
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,611
Yeah?

286
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,313
And I just moved in upstairs.

287
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,448
Okay. What do you want, Donnie? It's late.

288
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,783
I can hear your music.

289
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:09,384
Yeah? I didn't know it was that loud.

290
00:23:09,386 --> 00:23:10,454
Well, it is, all right?

291
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:12,055
I gotta wake up early and work out.

292
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,756
Oh. Oh, got you.

293
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:18,128
You gotta wake up early
and do your, uh, jawns.

294
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,496
Keep your body tight. Cool.

295
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:22,565
I'll turn my music down.
You won't hear a peep.

296
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,768
Thanks...

297
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:21,959
Snap it back!

00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,871
Good boy.

Hey.

301
00:24:44,315 --> 00:24:45,415
Can I help you?

302
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:46,984
Looking to sign up.

303
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,351

- L.A.

304
00:24:49,353 --> 00:24:50,653
Hollywood!

305
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,555
Which gym? I know all those guys.

306
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:56,192
Don't have one. I'm more self-taught.

307
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,195
Self-taught?

308
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:00,030
You know Balboa?

309
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:02,599
Yes, we grew up together.

310
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,566

311

For an extra $20 a month,

312
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:09,639
I can give you drills,
check in on you when I can.

313
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,175
Yeah, that works.

331
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:47,803
between "Pretty" Ricky
Conlan and Danny Wheeler.

332
00:26:47,805 --> 00:26:51,240
But we guess the fighters
couldn't wait another 24 hours.

333

335

00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,794
Hey, Unc!

339
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,763
Unc!

340
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,899
How you doing?

341
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,501
Did you call me "Unc"?

342
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:20,003
Yeah, it was either that or O.G.

343
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,772
What's an "O.G."?

344
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:24,174
Old-ass gangster.

345
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:25,641
"Unc" is good.

346
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,176
I can do that.

347
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,278
It's all good.

348
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,246
So why'd you come by? You hungry?

349
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:33,149
No, I just wrapped up at the gym.

350
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,516
Figured I'd stop by.

351
00:27:34,518 --> 00:27:37,254
Okay.

352
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:38,621
Maybe ask you a question.

353
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:42,859
Sure. I can do all this.

354
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,092
Uh...

355
00:27:44,094 --> 00:27:46,595
What are some drills I can
do to get my hand speed up?

356
00:27:46,597 --> 00:27:48,531
Some guys up there, I
bet they can help you.

357
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:49,966
There's a guy there named Pete.

358
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,668
He's a pretty good trainer.

359
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,603
Yeah, but he's with his
fighter most of the time.

360
00:27:54,605 --> 00:27:57,674
I mostly just train myself.

361
00:27:58,876 --> 00:28:01,244
They know you're a Creed?

362
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,312
I don't go by that.

363
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:04,546
I'm trying to make it on my own.

364
00:28:04,548 --> 00:28:05,747
Name's Johnson.

365
00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:08,150
- Who's Johnson?
- Mom's name.

366
00:28:08,152 --> 00:28:11,553
Plus, just makes life easier.

367
00:28:11,555 --> 00:28:13,557
Uh-huh.

368
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:18,394
Plus, you know, if you train me

369
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:19,695
ain't nobody around here knows me.

370
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:22,666
We could fly under the radar.

371
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:25,168
- They'd never know.
- Yeah.

372
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,602
I told you before,

373
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:29,806
I just don't wanna do it, kid.

374
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:33,576
That's cool, but maybe you could just

375
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:36,178
give me some drills.

376
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,882
- Drills?
- Yeah, things I could do on my own.

377
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:43,620
You don't stop, do you?
You're like a woodpecker.

378
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:45,957
My God.

379
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:54,930
All right. I got a few.

380
00:28:54,932 --> 00:28:56,932
But that's it. Okay?

381
00:28:56,934 --> 00:28:58,001
Of course.

382
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:02,072
Five rounds of jumping rope.

383
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:06,575
Three rounds on each of the bags...

384
00:29:06,577 --> 00:29:08,044
When you get to the heavy bag,

385
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,545
just don't keep throwing your hands

386
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,180
because you can hurt them.

387
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:14,016
It's also about using your legs, all right?

388
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:19,022
And then five rounds of...

389
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:20,689
Shadow...

390
00:29:20,691 --> 00:29:21,858
O-W.

391
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,959
- There's a "W." Boxing.
- Boxing, yeah.

392
00:29:23,961 --> 00:29:26,630
And that's it.

393
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:28,563
- All right?
- Yeah.

394
00:29:28,565 --> 00:29:30,233
Okay, here you go.

395
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,399
Oh, that is perfect.

396
00:29:31,401 --> 00:29:34,236
Good luck with that.

397
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:38,875
All right, got it. Hold that real quick.

398
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:48,651
All right, man.

399
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:50,586
Wait, don't you want this?

400
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:51,786
I got it right here.

401
00:29:51,788 --> 00:29:53,622
What if you lose that thing or it breaks?

402
00:29:53,624 --> 00:29:56,693
It's already up in the cloud.

403
00:29:59,663 --> 00:30:03,100
What cloud? What cloud?

404
00:30:04,568 --> 00:30:06,302
Hey, Ma, it's me.

405
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,237
I was just calling to let
you know I'm doing good

406
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:11,140
and I got an apartment.

407
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,110
<i>It ain't much but I'm trying
to make it into something.</i>

408
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,012
<i>I miss you.</i>

409
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,613
<i>I wanna hear from you,</i>

410
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:21,118
so call me back when you
get a chance. All right.

411
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,072
What, it's too loud?

412
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:45,842
No, I just heard you down here working.

413
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,544
Figured you'd wanna take a break.

414
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:49,912
Maybe get some food?

415
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:51,113
Where you from, Donnie?

416
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,715
I'm from L.A.

417
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:55,685
So is this how y'all
ask females out in L.A.?

418
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,387
Just wanted to know if you were hungry.

419
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:58,721
Not a date.

420
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,724
Right.

421
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:04,794
You know what? It's all good.

422
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,661
It's okay.

423
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:08,531
Hey, yo.

424
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,002
I am hungry.

425
00:31:16,173 --> 00:31:18,874
I only have an hour. Do
you know where you wanna go?

426
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:20,909
I was hoping you could tell me.

427
00:31:20,911 --> 00:31:23,146
You're from Philly, right?

428
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,018
Okay.

429
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,725
Good luck, man.

430
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:48,771
So where are we?

431
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:50,238
North Philly.

432
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,573
So this is Max's.

433
00:31:51,575 --> 00:31:54,209
Hey, superstar! What's going on?

434
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:55,777
I'm well, thanks. How you doing?

435
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:57,345
You looking wonderful as always.

436
00:31:57,347 --> 00:31:58,782
Thank you.

437
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:00,216
How you doing there, my friend?

438
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,517
This my neighbor and he's a West Coast boy.

439
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:03,785
Ain't never had a steak before.

440
00:32:03,787 --> 00:32:05,721
Listen, I'm gonna treat
him like he was my neighbor.

441
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,457
That's how good we gonna take care of you.

442
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:08,858
- You like pickles?
- Nah.

443
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,259
Okay, mayonnaise.

444
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,594
Put extra peppers on that jawn, both kinds.

445
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:14,730
Ketchup, extra cheese.

446
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,765
- How much I owe you?
- $9.95.

447
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:18,467
No, let me get these.

448
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:20,636
That's cool. I asked you out, right?

449
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:22,938
You said it wasn't a date, though.

450
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,374
It's not.

451
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:26,441
Where we eating at?

452
00:32:26,443 --> 00:32:27,909
Right there.

453
00:32:27,911 --> 00:32:30,211
<i>So I heard you back there,
"jawn" this, "jawn" that.</i>

454
00:32:30,213 --> 00:32:31,281
<i>What's a "jawn"?</i>

455
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,982
It's a noun.

456
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:36,119
See, these is jawns.

457
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,586
This is a jawn.

458
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,723
This restaurant we're sitting
in is a jawn. You're a jawn.

459
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:41,457
You got a jawn?

460
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,059
Like, a dude?

461
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,826
No.

462
00:32:44,828 --> 00:32:46,896
I got too much going on right now.

463
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,130
Shows and stuff?

464
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,399
Yeah.

465
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,834
I'm opening at Electric Factory next month.

466
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,002
What's that?

467
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,336
It's a big venue out here.

468
00:32:54,338 --> 00:32:56,005
A lot of people got their start.

469
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,742
Jill, Legend, the Roots.

470
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:01,112
That's wassup.

471
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,813
Can I ask you something personal?

472
00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:06,950
Mmm-hmm.

473
00:33:10,354 --> 00:33:13,823
I got progressive hearing loss.

474
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,659
Just started wearing these this past year.

475
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:18,494
But I only need them in places
with a lot of background noise.

476
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,595
For now.

477
00:33:20,597 --> 00:33:23,365
So it's progressive, so eventually...

478
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:26,201
Yeah.

479
00:33:26,203 --> 00:33:27,937
Yeah.

480
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,470
I'm just getting ready for it.

481
00:33:29,472 --> 00:33:30,706
Like I'm getting used to these,

482
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:33,809
I'm learning sign language and stuff.

483
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:38,214
But I really can only remember bad words.

484
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:41,419
Ones that aren't that useful like...

485
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,321
The fuck's that?

486
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:49,559
You can't tell? This is the
bull, the horns, this is...

487
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:51,894
Yeah, this is bullshit.

488
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:53,062
That's your favorite?

489
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:54,996
Uh-huh.

490
00:33:54,998 --> 00:33:57,533
You don't really seem like a boxer to me.

491
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,869
I mean, you're in shape and all but...

492
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,937
I don't know. Aren't most boxers like...

493
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,840
- Like what?
- Like street.

494
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:06,042
I'm not saying you're a square or anything,

495
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,743
but I'm just curious,
what made you wanna fight?

496
00:34:08,745 --> 00:34:10,045
My pop was a fighter.

497
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:12,248
Oh, right. That makes sense.

498
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,317
Did he fight pro?

499
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:16,484
Something like that.

500
00:34:16,486 --> 00:34:18,420
Does he train you?

501
00:34:18,422 --> 00:34:21,325
My pop died before I was born.

502
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,029
I'm sorry to hear that.

503
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:30,634
So what made you wanna sing?

504
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:38,241
Uh...

505
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:41,279
It makes me feel alive.

506
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:45,882
Where's your next show?

507
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:49,118
That place that you saw
me at, Johnny Brenda's.

508
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,790
I got a residency there
so we're back on Friday.

509
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,726
Can I roll with you?

510
00:34:58,728 --> 00:35:02,433
I wanna show up, you know. Show some love.

511
00:35:04,968 --> 00:35:07,270
Let me think on it.

512
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,092
Okay.

513
00:35:31,094 --> 00:35:34,763
Here we go, Paulie.

514
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:38,935
Happy birthday, my friend.

515
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:41,837
I didn't forget ya.

516
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,239
Your favorite.

517
00:35:44,241 --> 00:35:47,109
Miss ya, pal.

518
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:51,679
Yo, Adrian, my darling.

519
00:35:51,681 --> 00:35:54,618
The best of the best.

520
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:59,187
I'll tell you, Adrian, God.

521
00:35:59,189 --> 00:36:03,591
It's getting harder to walk up
this hill. What does that mean?

522
00:36:03,593 --> 00:36:05,761
Anyway, it's a good day today.

523
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:08,029
It's a good day, got no problems.

524
00:36:08,031 --> 00:36:09,765
Bills are paid.

525
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,933
Only thing is, it's tough to

526
00:36:11,935 --> 00:36:14,304
sleep at night sometimes. My back.

527
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:17,873
No matter what you do,
it catches up to you.

528
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:22,946
Anyway, shall we see what's
new in the world today?

529
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:03,953
Whoa.

530
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,120
Hey, Rocky!

531
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:06,355
Hey, how you doing?

532
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:08,190
- Good to see you.
- How you doing?

533
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:10,092
Hey, Rock! Long time no see, brother.

534
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:11,928
- Still here? Good to see you.
- Yeah.

535
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,429
Hey, the Italian Stallion's back.

536
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:14,730
How you doing?

537
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,232
- It's like a party here with everyone.
- Yeah, right.

538
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,433
Welcome back, man. It's been a while.

539
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,500
Yeah, thank you very much.

540
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:19,569
- How do you feel?
- Good.

541
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,437
- What, are you making a comeback?
- No.

542
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,272
- Hey, champ.
- Hey, Pete. What's up?

543
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:24,373
Didn't know you were coming by.

544
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,607
I didn't either.

545
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:27,676
I was just in the neighborhood.
You've done nice here.

546
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,944
Place is looking good,
new paint and everything.

547
00:37:29,946 --> 00:37:31,379
- Very good, very nice.
- I do what I can.

548
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:32,982
- Remember my son, Leo?
- Of course I do.

549
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,449
A lot bigger since you last seen him.

550
00:37:34,451 --> 00:37:36,317
- Yeah, very big.
- Rocky,

551
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:38,020
he's 17 and 0.

552
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,089
Things are really opening up for us.

553
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,658
Leo! Come.

554
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:47,029
Rocky, option's still open
if you wanna get involved.

555
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:49,165
Little training, little motivation.

556
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:50,600
Let me think about it.

557
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:51,667
Sure, sure.

558
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:52,768
How you doing, kid?

559
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,870
It's an honor to meet you, champ.

560
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:55,904
Nice to meet you, too. 17 and 0, very good.

561
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,007
Yeah, I was supposed to fight
on the Ricky Conlan's card...

562
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,911
- Hey, Unc!
- But it got canceled.

563
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,212
Unc.

564
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,246
- He talking to you?
- Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

565
00:38:05,248 --> 00:38:06,716
- You made it.
- Yeah.

566
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:09,752
Just walked by. Here I am.

567
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,120
How you know Hollywood?

568
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,089
Uh, we met at the restaurant.

569
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:16,426
That's it.

570
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:21,163
Okay, Rock. Okay.

571
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:23,799
You need anything, you let me know.

572
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,667
Okay. Good luck, kid. Seriously.

573
00:38:25,669 --> 00:38:26,935
Thanks.

574
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:31,272
17 and 0. Kid's got a future. Tough.

575
00:38:31,274 --> 00:38:33,943
Can I talk to you a minute?

576
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,183
I don't really know what I'm doing here

577
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,451
because I got other plans for my life

578
00:38:43,453 --> 00:38:45,120
and this wasn't part of it.

579
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:47,123
Your father was special.

580
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:49,458
Tell you the truth, I don't
know if you're special.

581
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,928
Only you gonna know that
when the time is right.

582
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,529
It ain't gonna come overnight.

583
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,230
You're gonna take a beating,
you're gonna take this,

584
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,299
you're gonna get knocked
down, you're gonna get up

585
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:59,402
and you're gonna see if
you got the right thing.

586
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:02,036
But, you gotta work hard.

587
00:39:02,038 --> 00:39:04,839
I swear to God, if you're not gonna do it,

588
00:39:04,841 --> 00:39:07,308
I'm out.

589
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:10,045
Rock, every punch I've ever
thrown has been on my own.

590
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:13,549
Nobody showed me how to do this.

591
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:16,186
I'm ready.

592
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,390
Come on. Let's do this.

593
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:22,859
Step into my office.

594
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:23,926
You serious?

595
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,761
I am serious. This is old school.

596
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:27,629
You should be able to
grab one of these birds.

597
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:28,996
30 seconds?

598
00:39:28,998 --> 00:39:32,567
Yeah, in your dreams.

599
00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:35,171
Come on! You call that fast?

600
00:39:42,178 --> 00:39:44,746
No! Again.

601
00:39:44,748 --> 00:39:46,516
I thought you were fast.

602
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:48,250
Come here!

603
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:50,118
Get them legs moving!

604
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,888
Little harder, little faster!

605
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,859
Keep up the pace! Keep going!

606
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:09,571
Control your tempo then build slowly.

607
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,739
More.

608
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,107
Build, build, build.

609
00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:15,111
Go!

610
00:40:27,123 --> 00:40:29,058
That bell don't mean school's out, Donnie.

611
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,060
Keep going.

612
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:33,629
That bell means hell.

613
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,065
Just go get the chicken.
It's not that big a deal.

614
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:37,232
Come here! God damn it!

615
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:41,236
Oh, my God!

616
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:45,741
That's pretty good.
Chickens are slowing down.

617
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:48,476
All right. Donnie, get into your stance.

618
00:40:48,478 --> 00:40:52,080
Make a small target, turn sideways. Okay.

619
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:54,248
You see this guy here staring back at you?

620
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,317
Yeah.

621
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:57,120
That's your toughest opponent.

622
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:58,987
Every time you get into the ring,

623
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,821
that's who you're going against.

624
00:41:00,823 --> 00:41:05,460
I believe that in boxing and I
do believe that in life, okay?

625
00:41:05,462 --> 00:41:07,462
Now throw a jab in the jaw.

626
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:09,297
All right, one to the gut.

627
00:41:09,299 --> 00:41:11,900
Now, every time you punch
this guy, what's he doing?

628
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:13,469
- He's throwing one back at me.
- That's right.

629
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:18,075
So either you block it, slip
it or get out of the way. Go.

630
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:25,647
I'll leave you two alone for a while.

631
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,984
Good luck.

632
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,725
- Hey.
- Yo.

633
00:41:37,727 --> 00:41:40,795
What's up? Is it cool?

634
00:41:40,797 --> 00:41:41,862
Yes.

635
00:41:41,864 --> 00:41:45,400
Smells good in here.

636
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:48,069
I don't even know what fighters drink.

637
00:41:48,071 --> 00:41:49,371
Do you drink tea?

638
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,373
Yeah, tea's good. Thank you.

639
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,509
Yeah.

640
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,444
So this is the house.

641
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,748
This is it.

642
00:41:58,848 --> 00:42:00,082
What you working on?

643
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,286
Uh...

644

<i>♪ The cake that you got ♪</i>

656
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:30,112
- Where the beat go?
- Sorry.

657
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:36,853
Hey, check you out.

658
00:42:40,256 --> 00:42:41,589
Whoo.

659
00:42:41,591 --> 00:42:44,060
Yeah!

660
00:43:15,792 --> 00:43:17,259
One, two, three.

661
00:43:18,594 --> 00:43:21,297
I like that. Very good.

662
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:26,435
Keep that balance going. Way to go.

663
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:30,705
Donnie, get up. You gotta keep moving.

664
00:43:30,707 --> 00:43:32,875
It's tough but you gotta do it.

665
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:34,275
You get a "B" in tough.

666
00:43:34,277 --> 00:43:37,179
Kid's looking good, champ!

667
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:40,214
Yeah, he's getting there.

668
00:43:40,216 --> 00:43:44,053
Hey, Hollywood, what
do you weigh right now?

669
00:43:44,055 --> 00:43:47,723
I don't know, probably like 180.

670
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:49,726
Why?

671
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:55,163
Get down to a buck 75,

672
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:56,931
we'll make something
happen, if you're interested.

673
00:43:56,933 --> 00:43:58,167
- Hell, yeah, I'm interested.
- No.

674
00:43:58,169 --> 00:44:01,402
I do the talking, okay?
You do the fighting.

675
00:44:01,404 --> 00:44:04,873
175? That's your boy's
weight. How you doing, Leo?

676
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,708
- What's up, Rock?
- Yeah.

677
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,342
He could use a fight to keep warm.

678
00:44:08,344 --> 00:44:09,911
- Warm?
- I'm not gonna lie to you.

679
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:12,214
People will come out to see
you in the corner again, champ.

680
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:15,417
We'll make it like the old
days. Get the whole city there.

681
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:16,717
Make a few bucks for everybody.

682
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:18,187
No, I understand that.

683
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:20,522
But I'm just getting used
to this kid right now,

684
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:22,690
and, you know, he's
getting better every day

685
00:44:22,692 --> 00:44:24,359
but he's gonna take a while.

686
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:25,527
He's hungry.

687
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:29,031
You gotta feed him every
now and again. You know that.

688
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,699
Thanks. I appreciate it,
chef. We'll be okay. Thanks.

689
00:44:31,701 --> 00:44:35,036
- Think about it.
- I'll think about it.

690
00:44:35,038 --> 00:44:37,004
Rock, what we training for?

691
00:44:37,006 --> 00:44:38,339
Yeah, what are we training for?

692
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:40,942
We're training to win, not get
killed. You're not ready yet.

693
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:42,944
I can lose five pounds. I can
lose five pounds like that.

694
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:44,679
It's nothing, it's easy.

695
00:44:44,681 --> 00:44:47,084
Hit the bag.

696
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,819
Come on.

697
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:53,121
This kid's like a tough
Philadelphia fighter.

698
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,024
I ain't never even seen you battle before.

699
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,357
Yeah, but I've been watching him,

700
00:44:56,359 --> 00:44:58,060
and I'm pretty sure he'd catch my fade.

701
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:00,194
- What's a fade?
- I could take him out.

702
00:45:00,196 --> 00:45:01,263
Oh, okay.

703
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:02,397
All right, listen.

704
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:04,866
Let me make you an offer you can't refuse.

705
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:05,967
Are you crazy?

706
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:08,004
No, I'm serious, man.
Look, we take the match.

707
00:45:08,006 --> 00:45:10,205
- Right.
- I got six weeks to get in shape.

708
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,841
Six weeks, I'll do whatever it
takes. At the end of the six weeks,

709
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:13,942
you don't think it's right, call it off.

710
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:15,009
Really?

711
00:45:15,011 --> 00:45:17,078
Look, this is what I'm here for, all right?

712
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,813
I'll go 24-7 with this shit.

713
00:45:18,815 --> 00:45:21,216
Matter of fact, we can
go get my stuff right now.

714
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,283
For what?

715
00:45:22,285 --> 00:45:23,484
So I can move into your spot.

716
00:45:23,486 --> 00:45:25,821
Start training camp. Old school, remember?

717
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:27,621
No, no one's been in
my house in a long time

718
00:45:27,623 --> 00:45:29,257
and I don't think you'd
be comfortable there.

719
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:31,527
What, you walk around naked?

720
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:32,661
No.

721
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,931
We're good then.

722
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:49,745
You better not walk around naked either.

723
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,112
That's for sure.

724
00:46:01,424 --> 00:46:03,158
- Last one?
- Yeah, that's all of it.

725
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,025
Hey!

726
00:46:05,027 --> 00:46:06,094
Hey!

727
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,596
You're moving?

728
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,130
Yeah, today's been crazy.

729
00:46:09,132 --> 00:46:11,033
I didn't get a chance to tell you,

730
00:46:11,035 --> 00:46:12,935
but I'm gonna be living
with my uncle for a while,

731
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,002
training for the next fight.

732
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:15,337
That's your uncle?

733
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:17,304
He's white.

734
00:46:17,306 --> 00:46:19,540
Yeah, a long time.

735
00:46:19,542 --> 00:46:22,545
He's gonna be staying with
me, and when we ain't training

736
00:46:22,547 --> 00:46:24,712
you're welcome to come on over.

737
00:46:24,714 --> 00:46:27,950
Cool, thank you. It's nice to meet you.

738
00:46:31,754 --> 00:46:33,087
Why you giving me that look?

739
00:46:33,089 --> 00:46:37,458
When were you gonna tell me
that your uncle's Rocky Balboa?

740
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,726
I'm gonna call you.

741
00:46:38,728 --> 00:46:42,031
All right, I'm not gonna hold my breath.

742
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:50,205
<i>That Bianca girl looks kind of nice.</i>

743
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:51,306
You like her?

744
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,940
Yeah, she cool. What, this one?

745
00:46:52,942 --> 00:46:54,243
Yeah.

746
00:46:54,245 --> 00:46:56,310
Women weaken legs. You know what I mean?

747
00:46:56,312 --> 00:46:58,880
My legs work just fine.
Whose room was this?

748
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,781
- This is Paulie's room.
- Paulie.

749
00:47:00,783 --> 00:47:03,685
Paulie was my best friend even
though he wasn't so friendly.

750
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:05,819
What happened to him?

751
00:47:05,821 --> 00:47:07,688
- Passed away.
- I'm sorry.

752
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:09,257
Kind of a mess. We'll
straighten it up later.

753
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:11,694
It'll be comfortable.

754
00:47:11,696 --> 00:47:15,364
Oh, man, this is a dope
pic! That's your boy?

755
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:18,335
Yeah, that's my kid, Robert.

756
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,837
Did you train him, too?

757
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:27,643
I tried, but he just didn't
like fighting, didn't take to it.

758
00:47:29,078 --> 00:47:30,745
He still around here?

759
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:34,216
No, he moved to a place called
Vancouver with his girlfriend.

760
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:37,051
And I think they're having
a great old time up there

761
00:47:37,053 --> 00:47:39,254
and, you know, I hear
from him now and then,

762
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:42,457
but it was tough for him
to live in Philadelphia.

763
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:46,361
Me and all that stuff...
You know, Rocky's son.

764
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,665
He's happy. I'm happy for him.

765
00:47:54,305 --> 00:47:56,270
Why don't you unpack, all right?

766
00:47:56,272 --> 00:47:57,940
Make yourself comfortable.

767
00:47:57,942 --> 00:48:01,509
And I'm gonna go to the
restaurant and I'll be back.

768
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:03,545
Then we start first thing
in the morning, all right?

769
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,782
You got it.

770
00:48:22,265 --> 00:48:24,800
All right, Paulie!

771
00:48:25,835 --> 00:48:28,038
Ooh.

772
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:55,931
Hey, it's time to train.
This is how you start.

773
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:59,102
Get your engine going.

774
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,310
I'm gonna take you to this place called

775
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:10,310
the Front Street Gym up in North Philly.

776
00:49:10,312 --> 00:49:11,614
- It's pretty good.
- Okay.

777
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:13,147
You're gonna train there,
because I don't want you

778
00:49:13,149 --> 00:49:14,549
to train in the same place

779
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:16,851
as the guy that you're
gonna be fighting, right?

780
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:18,053
Yeah, that makes sense.

781
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:20,489
Don, don't get in. I
want you to run alongside.

782
00:49:20,491 --> 00:49:22,324
- I'm kinda antique, right?
- Yeah.

783
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:24,625
So I'll drive and you try to keep up.

784
00:49:24,627 --> 00:49:25,926
How close is it?

785
00:49:25,928 --> 00:49:28,362
It's close enough.

786
00:49:28,364 --> 00:49:30,399
All right.

787
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,971
Hey, wait! Let me warm up real quick.

788
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:56,257
You made it. Hey.

789
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:57,859
I thought you said it was close.

790
00:49:57,861 --> 00:49:59,493
Not that close.

791
00:49:59,495 --> 00:50:03,699
This is Frankford. Tough place.

792
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:07,067
You wanna be a Philly fighter,
this is the place to go.

793
00:50:07,069 --> 00:50:09,004
Philly fighters, you know,

794
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,672
I think they're the
toughest guys in the world.

795
00:50:11,674 --> 00:50:13,241
In a lot of ways.

796
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:16,745
Maybe it's in the water, I don't
know, but great place though.

797
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:18,112
What's up with all these bikes?

798
00:50:18,114 --> 00:50:19,246
It's a Philly thing.

799
00:50:19,248 --> 00:50:21,248
These guys are popping
wheelies and making noise,

800
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,783
going up and down the street.

801
00:50:22,785 --> 00:50:24,252
Do you ride?

802
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:28,723
No. I had a Harley once but I fell
off, so I decided to use my feet.

803
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:31,259
Now, this kid, Sporino,
he got something special.

804
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:32,627
He's no pushover, so you're gonna

805
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:35,629
have to work, you know what I mean?

806
00:50:35,631 --> 00:50:37,933
What do you think?

807
00:50:37,935 --> 00:50:39,134
Not bad, huh?

808
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:40,469
Not bad at all.

809
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:45,373
Yeah. This'll get the
job done. Really will.

810
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,808
Uh...

811
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,310
Look at these guys!

812
00:50:48,312 --> 00:50:51,112
Hey! The gang's all here!

813
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:54,248
Donnie, look at this.

814
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:56,183
This is a crew if I ever saw one.

815
00:50:56,185 --> 00:50:57,652
Hey, Padman. Good to see you.

816
00:50:57,654 --> 00:50:59,054
Hey, champ. How you doing, bro?

817
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,522
This guy is so good with the mitts,

818
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:01,989
he's gonna teach you a lot of stuff.

819
00:51:01,991 --> 00:51:05,592
He's got a lot of knowledge. And
Stitch, best cut man in Philadelphia.

820
00:51:05,594 --> 00:51:06,661
Hope we don't need him.

821
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:08,096
- What's going on?
- Welcome to Philly, brother.

822
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:09,263
- Pleasure.
- Glad to work with you.

823
00:51:09,265 --> 00:51:10,565
And over here is Elvis Grant.

824
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,833
He makes the best gloves in the world.

825
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:13,167
Uh-huh.

826
00:51:13,169 --> 00:51:15,437
And as my present to you,
starting out on the right foot...

827
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:16,703
- Nice to meet you, man.
- Nice to meet you too.

828
00:51:16,705 --> 00:51:18,071
He's gonna make you a pair of gloves

829
00:51:18,073 --> 00:51:19,973
so that your hands don't get so bad as me.

830
00:51:19,975 --> 00:51:21,576
What? Is that coffee I smell in there?

831
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:22,643
Yeah, that's coffee.

832
00:51:22,645 --> 00:51:24,179
All right, you guys get to know each other.

833
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:25,413
- Amir.
- All right, Unc.

834
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,982
- Come here.
- Man, I could use some coffee.

835
00:51:26,984 --> 00:51:29,016
Let me introduce you to my
son. This is my son, Amir.

836
00:51:29,018 --> 00:51:30,386
That's the one you're
gonna be sparring with.

837
00:51:30,388 --> 00:51:32,620
- Amir.
- Donnie. Nice to meet you.

838
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:40,127
Mmm-hmm.

839
00:51:40,129 --> 00:51:41,462
Right hand fast.

840
00:51:41,464 --> 00:51:44,632
Let it go, let it go.

841
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:47,167
Push off that back foot.

842
00:51:47,169 --> 00:51:48,502
Come on, Donnie, a little quicker.

843
00:51:48,504 --> 00:51:49,804
Come on, Donnie. Back it up.

844
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:51,605
No, just like he's doing. Yeah.

845
00:51:51,607 --> 00:51:53,708
- I can't pivot fast enough.
- Yeah, just turn it.

846
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,810
That's your power.

847
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:57,145
Fast, pop it fast.

848
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:58,478
I'm popping as fast as I can.

849
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,980
I'm trying to push off my
back foot like you told me.

850
00:51:59,982 --> 00:52:03,252
Hey, Donnie. Come here.

851
00:52:03,254 --> 00:52:04,886
I came out here to work with you, though.

852
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:06,621
This is how I work, okay?

853
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,522
There's some things I can't do.

854
00:52:08,524 --> 00:52:09,790
I can't do this anymore.

855
00:52:09,792 --> 00:52:11,525
I can never hold the pads like that.

856
00:52:11,527 --> 00:52:13,661
But I'm looking at you.
I'm working with you.

857
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:15,263
I'm working with this.

858
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:16,897
Lighten it up.

859
00:52:16,899 --> 00:52:19,266
Am I still taking them real shots?

860
00:52:19,268 --> 00:52:21,169
Slow it down. Hey, hey!

861
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:23,571
That's it. Hey, hey, hey!

862
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:26,540
This easy work, Pop.

863
00:52:26,542 --> 00:52:28,743
Gotta keep moving. That's it.

864
00:52:29,879 --> 00:52:31,078
Time! Bell! Bell.

865
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,147
Huh!

866
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,348
Taking real shots though!

867
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:35,382
- What you mean?
- Cut it out!

868
00:52:35,384 --> 00:52:36,585
Take those gloves off right now!

869
00:52:36,587 --> 00:52:37,853
- This my gym!
- Take the glove off right now!

870
00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:39,187
Take your soft ass back to L.A.!

871
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:41,556
You ain't ready yet! This my gym!

872
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:43,625
Fuck this gym!

873
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:45,493
- Called a learning curve...
- Ain't no learning.

874
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,663
Hey, hey, hey! You know what?

875
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:49,397
You can't learn anything
when you're talking.

876
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:50,565
That's a fact of life.

877
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,533
As long as you're talking,
you're not listening.

878
00:52:52,535 --> 00:52:57,038
Go apologize. You guys are
on the same damn team, okay?

879
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,505
There you go. Good.

880
00:52:58,507 --> 00:52:59,940
You good. It's okay.

881
00:52:59,942 --> 00:53:02,277
All right. Now let's go to work!

882
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:04,145
Double jab. Yup.

883
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:06,013
Go ahead over the top.

884
00:53:06,015 --> 00:53:08,751
Right hook here. Over here.

885
00:53:09,785 --> 00:53:12,054
One step at a time, one punch at a time,

886
00:53:12,056 --> 00:53:13,355
one round at a time.

887
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:15,357
One step at a time, one punch at a time,

888
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,061
one round at a time. Turn right.

889
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:21,763
Come on, let's go.

890
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:22,964
Fast, pop it fast.

891
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:26,533
Right upper cut. Right up top.

892
00:53:26,535 --> 00:53:29,438
Boom. Boom.

893
00:53:30,806 --> 00:53:32,274
Good.

894
00:53:32,276 --> 00:53:34,842
I want you to let it all out.

895
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:36,044
Now go right here.

896
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,879
Everyone's ever disrespected you, see them.

897
00:53:38,881 --> 00:53:41,083
Anything you ever wanted

898
00:53:41,085 --> 00:53:43,853
go after it.

899
00:53:44,922 --> 00:53:48,091
Now's your time! Make a statement!

900
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,426
One step!

901
00:53:52,428 --> 00:53:54,995
One punch!

902
00:53:54,997 --> 00:53:57,166
One round at a time!

903
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:05,973
There it is.

904
00:54:05,975 --> 00:54:10,011
Ah! You cheated!

905
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:21,522
Rock.

906
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:24,259
Hey, how you doing, Pete?

907
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:30,198
Something wrong?

908
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,866
Rock, I knew.

909
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:34,169
I knew there was something with this kid.

910
00:54:34,171 --> 00:54:36,071
Rocky, I have been trying for years

911
00:54:36,073 --> 00:54:37,406
to get you to come work with us.

912
00:54:37,408 --> 00:54:38,873
Aw. It's okay.

913
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:41,308
All of a sudden, this kid from
Hollywood gets you out of the shadows.

914
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:42,877
No. No shadows.

915
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:45,480
I just didn't want to do
nothing in the gym, that's all.

916
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:48,516
Rocky, I made calls to L.A.

917
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:50,217
Kid's name is Adonis.

918
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:51,853
Kid has Creed's blood.

919
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:56,225
Now this fight just got big time.

920
00:54:56,227 --> 00:54:58,725
I apologize.

921
00:54:58,727 --> 00:55:01,328
Do me a favor. Can we keep
this between ourselves?

922
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:02,696
- Oh, come on.
- No.

923
00:55:02,698 --> 00:55:06,701
I'm asking you as a favor. I want
him to make a name on his own.

924
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:11,975
Come on, Pete.

925
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:17,412
Yeah. Secret's safe with me, Rock.

926
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:21,651
I appreciate it.

927
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:32,159
Keep going. You're looking good.

928
00:55:32,161 --> 00:55:34,430
Go on, get moving.

929
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,949
Hey. So how's everybody feeling tonight?

930
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:56,783
I'm about to go over the ABC rules

931
00:55:56,785 --> 00:55:58,554
and the rules governed by the state.

932
00:55:58,556 --> 00:56:01,288
No three knockdown rule.
No standing eight-count.

933
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:03,424
A fighter cannot be saved by the bell.

934
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:05,560
What we mean by "no three knockdown rule"

935
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:07,060
is basically whatever the referee

936
00:56:07,062 --> 00:56:09,496
sees fit for competition...

937
00:56:15,439 --> 00:56:16,804
Unc, cut my gloves off.

938
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:17,906
What's wrong?

939
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:19,172
My gloves, just cut 'em off!

940
00:56:19,174 --> 00:56:20,708
I can't cut 'em off,
you're ready to go fight.

941
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,810
Are they too tight?

942
00:56:21,812 --> 00:56:24,279
I'm freaking out right
now! I gotta take a shit!

943
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:26,781
Somebody gonna wipe my ass for me?

944
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:28,616
- Shit!
- Cut my gloves off, Unc!

945
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:30,317
All right, relax.

946
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,152
I'll cut you out of
these gloves. It happens.

947
00:56:32,154 --> 00:56:33,987
Hey, ref, I'm gonna need some help here.

948
00:56:33,989 --> 00:56:35,524
D, I'm gonna be right outside.

949
00:56:35,526 --> 00:56:37,058
That's right.

950
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,792
Can you just stall for
10 minutes or something?

951
00:56:38,794 --> 00:56:40,161
I gotta put the gloves back on.

952
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:41,495
All right, I'll step on outside, Rock.

953
00:56:41,497 --> 00:56:42,730
I appreciate it. Thank you very much.

954
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:43,832
It ain't no problem. You got 10 minutes.

955
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:44,899
First for me, man.

956
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,533
All right, come on. It'll be all right.

957
00:56:46,535 --> 00:56:47,734
Yeah.

958
00:56:47,736 --> 00:56:49,737
A little nervous?

959
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,542
- Nerves?
- Hurry up!

960
00:56:55,911 --> 00:56:59,112
Blue corner, red corner.

961
00:56:59,114 --> 00:57:00,181
All right, fellas,

962
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:02,150
y'all had your instructions
in the dressing room.

963
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:05,553
Obey my commands at all times,
protect yourself at all times.

964
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:07,187
Any questions from the blue corner?

965
00:57:07,189 --> 00:57:08,824
Questions from the red corner?

966
00:57:08,826 --> 00:57:10,958
Touch them up. Be ready on seconds out.

967
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,393
Right. It's about you.

968
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:13,594
Yep. Yep.

969
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:16,063
It's all about you. Now, you wanted this.

970
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:18,299
- Let's go, Coach.
- I want you to make it happen.

971
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:19,400
- Can you do it?
- Let's do it.

972
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:21,402
- All right. Come on.
- Let's make it happen.

973
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:23,805
Let's go, Unc.

974
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:27,875
It's all about today!

975
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:31,178
There is no tomorrow! Let's go!

976
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:33,515
Nice!

977
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:36,516
Move and target, move and target!

978
00:57:36,518 --> 00:57:39,520
Jab! It's the jab!

979
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:42,991
His face is right there!
Come on! Where's the jab?

980
00:57:46,562 --> 00:57:49,364
Hands up. Hands up, kid.

981
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:58,907
Breathe, kid, breathe!

982
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:06,080
Let's go, boy! Let's go, boy!

983
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:08,216
Way to get out of there.

984
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:10,317
Keep moving, Donnie!

985
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:12,286
Move your head! That's it.

986
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:14,790
Get on him! Get on him!

987
00:58:18,093 --> 00:58:20,862
Break! My break!

988
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:22,763
Let's go, boy!

989
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:25,433
There you go! There you go! Good.

990
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:26,634
Back off.

991
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:30,004
Leo! Leo! Leo!

992
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,507
One punch on top.

993
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:39,614
Keep moving. That's right.
Block left. Block left.

994
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:46,219
Relax.

995
00:58:46,221 --> 00:58:48,390
Let's go, boy! Come get
this shit! Come get it!

996
00:58:48,392 --> 00:58:49,857
You're doing good, kid!

997
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,158
Keep the pressure up!

998
00:58:56,698 --> 00:58:57,799
Break!

999
00:58:57,801 --> 00:58:59,266
Let's go, Leo!

1000
00:58:59,268 --> 00:59:00,335
Come on!

1001
00:59:00,337 --> 00:59:01,435
Let's go.

1002
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:03,705
Keep moving! Keep coming forward!

1003
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,808
Great shot!

1004
00:59:07,109 --> 00:59:09,578
Come on, Donnie!

1005
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,813
What are you doing?

1006
00:59:13,815 --> 00:59:15,516
Time!

1007
00:59:15,518 --> 00:59:18,353
Yeah.

1008
00:59:18,355 --> 00:59:21,688
Okay! All right.

1009
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:23,324
It's okay. Take a deep breath.

1010
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:25,525
Through your lungs.
Deep breath. Deep breath.

1011
00:59:25,527 --> 00:59:26,728
Look at me.

1012
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,462
I like what you're doing
out there, all right?

1013
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:29,630
You're a little tight.

1014
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:30,964
You're gonna loosen up, all right?

1015
00:59:30,966 --> 00:59:32,533
Here's what I want you to do.

1016
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:34,669
I want you to throw your
left under the radar.

1017
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:36,304
- That's it.
- Then come up with a shovel hook.

1018
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:37,404
You're gonna see an opening,

1019
00:59:37,406 --> 00:59:39,973
put it right on his
chin, that'll drop him...

1020
00:59:39,975 --> 00:59:41,908
Mouthpiece in, seconds out!

1021
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:44,411
Your old man did that to me. It worked.

1022
00:59:44,413 --> 00:59:47,547
Mouthpiece in, seconds out!

1023
00:59:47,549 --> 00:59:52,120
Leo! Leo! Leo!

1024
00:59:59,861 --> 01:00:01,997
Come on!

1025
01:00:11,575 --> 01:00:13,743
Come on!

1026
01:00:25,754 --> 01:00:27,621
Tie him up! That's it.
Good boy! Tie him up!

1027
01:00:27,623 --> 01:00:30,223
Break!

1028
01:00:30,225 --> 01:00:32,260
Come on!

1029
01:00:33,629 --> 01:00:37,433
Kid, seize it now! Now! Now!

1030
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:41,335
Get up! Get up!

1031
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:42,402
Come on, kid! Come on!

1032
01:00:42,404 --> 01:00:44,205
- One! Two!
- Get up and get some!

1033
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:45,505
Three! Four!

1034
01:00:45,507 --> 01:00:46,741
We got him, Rock!

1035
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:48,442
Five! Six!

1036
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:50,143
Seven! Eight!

1037
01:00:50,145 --> 01:00:52,078
- I'm good.
- Nine! Ten!

1038
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,246
That's it, baby!

1039
01:00:53,248 --> 01:00:56,116
We got one, Rock! Whoo!

1040
01:00:56,118 --> 01:00:57,817
We got one! Yeah, we got one!

1041
01:00:57,819 --> 01:00:58,920
Unbelievable!

1042
01:00:58,922 --> 01:01:00,520
- It's because of you!
- No, you did it.

1043
01:01:00,522 --> 01:01:03,991
Come on, man! You did it.

1044
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:05,058
You okay?

1045
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,426
Give him some room. Rock. Rock. Rock.

1046
01:01:06,428 --> 01:01:07,828
Lucky shot.

1047
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:11,766
Come on in! Bianca! Bianca! Come in!

1048
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:12,933
Sorry! Sorry!

1049
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:14,435
I'm all good.

1050
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:16,670
You didn't say you had hands like that!

1051
01:01:16,672 --> 01:01:19,207
Why didn't you say you had
hands like that, though?

1052
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:22,143
Well, but girl, I'm square
though. I'm square though.

1053
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:24,045
You good? What we doing after this?

1054
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:25,112
Let's go for it.

1055
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:27,583
- Let's go tear the city up!
- Okay.

1056
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:57,846
- Hey.
- Hmm.

1057
01:01:57,848 --> 01:02:00,683
I made something for you.

1058
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:15,230
- Keep 'em closed.
- Mmm-hmm.

1059
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:44,527
Come listen with me.

1060
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,192
- What about your uncle?
- Huh.

1061
01:03:17,194 --> 01:03:19,761
He's asleep.

1062
01:03:19,763 --> 01:03:22,297
He old, man.

1063
01:03:58,433 --> 01:03:59,699
There he is.

1064
01:03:59,701 --> 01:04:01,069
- What's up, Unc?
- Hey, how you feeling?

1065
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:05,573
I'm good. I'm a little
sore, but I'm all right.

1066
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:07,241
- You want some toast?
- Okay.

1067
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:10,578
So you cooking or you watching?

1068
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:11,745
No, I'm looking you up.

1069
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:13,281
- You're doing what?
- I'm looking you up.

1070
01:04:13,283 --> 01:04:14,547
No, don't do that. I'm right here.

1071
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:23,258
Mmm.

1072
01:04:25,594 --> 01:04:27,393
What's up?

1073
01:04:27,395 --> 01:04:29,931
You got something you wanna tell me?

1074
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:42,643
I didn't lie.

1075
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:43,745
You might as well have.

1076
01:04:43,747 --> 01:04:45,145
You told me that your dad was some fighter.

1077
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:47,214
You didn't say he was the most
famous fighter to ever live.

1078
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,150
People look at me
differently when they know.

1079
01:04:49,152 --> 01:04:50,484
They look at Apollo differently, too.

1080
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:52,419
Yeah, Donnie, but I'm not people.

1081
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:53,788
I don't care about that shit.

1082
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:56,623
I do care about you keeping
it 100 with me, though.

1083
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:59,326
Well, listen. You're right, okay?

1084
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:03,330
No, seriously, look. You...

1085
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:06,634
100% honesty from here on out.

1086
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:12,174
All right. So his... His
wife, that's not your mom?

1087
01:05:13,341 --> 01:05:15,743
Apollo had an affair with my mom.

1088
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,346
All right? She died when I was young.

1089
01:05:18,348 --> 01:05:21,783
I bounced around foster
care for a couple years.

1090
01:05:21,785 --> 01:05:24,284
In and out of juvie.

1091
01:05:24,286 --> 01:05:27,855
Then Mary Anne tracked
me down and took me in.

1092
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:30,191
Anything else?

1093
01:05:31,828 --> 01:05:33,794
Ask me.

1094
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:35,795
How many females have
you been with before me?

1095
01:05:35,797 --> 01:05:38,632
Anything else?

1096
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:40,634
Look, Bianca, come on now, you different.

1097
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:41,835
How?

1098
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:44,270
When I'm around you I feel
like I know you my whole life.

1099
01:05:44,272 --> 01:05:45,640
Mmm-hmm.

1100
01:05:45,642 --> 01:05:47,208
Tell me you don't feel
the same way about me.

1101
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:49,375
Whatever. That's passion.
That's infatuation. That fades.

1102
01:05:49,377 --> 01:05:50,810
I can't see that happening.

1103
01:05:50,812 --> 01:05:52,779
- Why not?
- You motivate me.

1104
01:05:52,781 --> 01:05:54,181
Okay, so I'm just motivation to you?

1105
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:55,583
Are you gonna find a problem
with everything I say?

1106
01:05:55,585 --> 01:05:58,454
No, I'm gonna find the
real in what you're saying.

1107
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:01,355
Don't worry, it's cool.

1108
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:03,723
Maybe you're just motivation to me, too.

1109
01:06:03,725 --> 01:06:06,027
- Oh, really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1110
01:06:06,029 --> 01:06:08,330
I don't mind that.

1111
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:12,301
What?

1112
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,069
You do look like him, though.

1113
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:16,770
Oh, my God. I hate that!

1114
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:19,908
Just to get on my nerves!

1115

01:07:08,723 --> 01:07:10,357
<i>But I'm not gonna say it's
gonna kill his legacy.</i>

1134
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,192
<i>I think it's an embarrassment</i>

1135
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:14,728
<i>and I think the family must
have felt this embarrassment</i>

1136
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:16,830
<i>because they kept it
under wraps for so long.</i>

1137
01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:18,799
- <i>But I really have one question.</i>
- <i>What?</i>

1138
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:21,268
<i>Can the kid fight as
well as the old man?</i>

1139
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:23,305
<i>That's a stretch.</i>

1140
01:07:25,075 --> 01:07:27,910
I found us our next payday.

1141
01:07:29,344 --> 01:07:31,645
Check it out.

1142
01:07:33,248 --> 01:07:34,614
- Creed's son?
- Yeah.

1143
01:07:34,616 --> 01:07:36,250
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

1144
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:37,618
He's got one fight under his belt.

1145
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,687
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know.

1146
01:07:39,689 --> 01:07:41,554
But he's got Balboa in his corner.

1147
01:07:41,556 --> 01:07:44,658
No one cares about Balboa anymore.

1148
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:47,527
Kid's here because of a name alone.

1149
01:07:47,529 --> 01:07:48,929
You're gonna do it.

1150
01:07:48,931 --> 01:07:50,665
This guy doesn't even deserve a shot.

1151
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:53,701
Listen to me. This is not
a negotiation, all right?

1152
01:07:53,703 --> 01:07:56,103
You're the idiot that ran
around Toxteth with a gun.

1153
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:58,172
Do you remember that?

1154
01:07:58,174 --> 01:08:01,475
And you are the clown who couldn't
control himself at a weigh-in

1155
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:03,544
and lost us millions in
the process. Millions, okay?

1156
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:06,813
So look at it again.

1157
01:08:08,283 --> 01:08:10,518
I don't wanna be remembered like this.

1158
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,652
I don't care how you're remembered.

1159
01:08:12,654 --> 01:08:14,154
I care about your kids having a roof

1160
01:08:14,156 --> 01:08:16,056
over their head when you're done.

1161
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:18,426
Do you understand?

1162
01:08:26,835 --> 01:08:27,901
Hello?

1163
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:31,807
It's Tommy Holiday. I
look after Ricky Conlan.

1164
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:35,808
- Yeah, how you doing?
- <i>Listen.</i>

1165
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:38,680
Is it true about the kid?

1166
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:42,584
About the kid?

1167
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:45,985
Uh...

1168
01:08:45,987 --> 01:08:49,557
Think you and the kid have got
30 minutes for a business meeting?

1169
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:52,826
All right, I'll tell you what.

1170
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:54,728
Yeah, if you can get over here, sure.

1171
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:57,364
We'll talk with you, but it's gotta be fast

1172
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:59,400
because we're training.

1173
01:08:59,402 --> 01:09:00,834
<i>I can be there. Couple of days.</i>

1174
01:09:00,836 --> 01:09:02,703
- Yeah.
- <i>I'll be in touch.</i>

1175
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:04,773
Okay.

1176
01:09:09,377 --> 01:09:11,611
Oh, man.

1177
01:09:11,613 --> 01:09:13,780
Thanks for taking the
time. I'll get right to it.

1178
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:18,218
My guy needs to fight
in the next six months

1179
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:21,355
and we've beaten everybody.

1180
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:23,457
You want me to fight Conlan?

1181
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:25,692
I think it would be a very wise move.

1182
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:27,695
You've been down in Mexico
doing pro fights, eh?

1183
01:09:27,697 --> 01:09:30,097
I've got you as 15-0 down there.

1184
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:32,598
And with the Sporino
fight, that makes you 16-0.

1185
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,968
Now, nobody needs to know these fights

1186
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:38,806
were in some hole in the wall, do they, eh?

1187
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:43,110
You think I'm ready?

1188
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:45,913
Donnie, this man came here because
he knows you're a sure thing.

1189
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:47,013
Right? It's a sure victory.

1190
01:09:47,015 --> 01:09:49,550
That is not true.

1191
01:09:50,752 --> 01:09:53,121
Yeah, it is.

1192
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:56,390
Okay, listen.

1193
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:58,924
All right.

1194
01:09:58,926 --> 01:10:02,128
This could be my guy's last fight.

1195
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:04,097
And I wanna make it count.

1196
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:05,231
Now, on that note,

1197
01:10:05,233 --> 01:10:07,801
we would need you to
change your name to Creed.

1198
01:10:07,803 --> 01:10:10,139
It's just a formality.

1199
01:10:15,176 --> 01:10:18,111
And what if I say no?

1200
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:20,748
Well, then there's no fight.

1201
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:22,115
Without the name, there's no fight.

1202
01:10:22,117 --> 01:10:25,418
It's a non-starter.

1203
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:26,721
Okay. Okay.

1204
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:30,423
Why don't you both take
a day, talk about it

1205
01:10:30,425 --> 01:10:34,094
and we'll, uh, see what you say, okay?

1206
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:36,364
It's a good deal.

1207
01:10:36,366 --> 01:10:37,932
Can't do it.

1208
01:10:37,934 --> 01:10:40,868
Nah, it's not my name.

1209
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:44,437
And plus, I wanna make
it on my own merit anyway.

1210
01:10:44,439 --> 01:10:45,839
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1211
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:48,609
You got a funny way of showing it.

1212
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:49,977
What's that supposed to mean?

1213
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:52,346
I mean, weren't Apollo and
Rocky like best friends?

1214
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:55,982
It feels like you're trying to tap
into whatever it is he left behind.

1215
01:10:55,984 --> 01:10:59,285
I don't think that's anything
to be ashamed of, you know?

1216
01:10:59,287 --> 01:11:00,387
What are you afraid of?

1217
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:03,324
Uh, what are you afraid of?

1218
01:11:03,326 --> 01:11:04,391
I don't know.

1219
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:06,793
I mean, this hearing shit don't scare you?

1220
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:08,795
Uh...

1221
01:11:08,797 --> 01:11:12,165
I always knew it would happen eventually

1222
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:15,235
so my plan has always just been

1223
01:11:15,237 --> 01:11:19,205
to do what I love for as long as I can.

1224
01:11:19,207 --> 01:11:23,375
I think that's all we ever do. You know?

1225
01:11:23,377 --> 01:11:26,948
So, what are you afraid of?

1226
01:11:28,216 --> 01:11:31,752
I'm afraid of taking
on the name and losing.

1227
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:34,487
They'll call me a fraud. Fake Creed.

1228
01:11:34,489 --> 01:11:37,490
Why don't you think about what's true?

1229
01:11:37,492 --> 01:11:40,495
You love to fight, right?

1230
01:11:41,529 --> 01:11:43,297
Yeah, it makes you happy, right?

1231
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,365
Yeah.

1232
01:11:44,367 --> 01:11:48,504
Yeah, and you are Apollo
Creed's son, right?

1233
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:50,837
Yes.

1234
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:54,107
So then use the name.

1235
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:56,678
It's yours.

1236
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:12,226
Hey, Unc, you down there?

1237
01:12:12,228 --> 01:12:14,229
Yeah.

1238
01:12:23,805 --> 01:12:27,040
I know you don't want me to do this, right?

1239
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:29,976
I can think of better things to do, Donnie.

1240
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:33,280
But if we did do it

1241
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:35,450
how we get it done?

1242
01:12:39,354 --> 01:12:41,356
Mmm.

1243
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:45,626
Well...

1244
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:53,232
He's taller than you.
He has a reach on you.

1245
01:12:53,234 --> 01:12:56,102
Definitely has a lot
more experience than you.

1246
01:12:56,104 --> 01:12:58,437
And he's faster than you are.

1247
01:12:58,439 --> 01:12:59,940
He's the champion.

1248
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:02,575
And since he's the champion,

1249
01:13:02,577 --> 01:13:05,678
you gotta bring the
fight to him, like I did.

1250
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:11,051
You gotta go to the body.
Dig. And in doing that

1251
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,819
you're in a very dangerous place

1252
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:15,588
because you can get laid out.

1253
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:19,326
It ain't easy for me to
be in your corner, kid.

1254
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:21,328
I don't know if you're ready for it.

1255
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:24,998
I don't know if I'm ready for it.

1256
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,267
But I'll do what you wanna do.

1257
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:30,003
If it was anybody else in my corner

1258
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:33,307
I wouldn't do it.

1259
01:13:33,309 --> 01:13:35,944
But I got you.

1260
01:13:38,679 --> 01:13:41,215
So make the call.

1261
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:44,852
All right.

1262
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:55,529
I'm fighting Ricky Conlan.

1263
01:13:59,167 --> 01:14:03,237
I'm fighting "Pretty" Ricky Conlan!

1264
01:14:08,977 --> 01:14:10,075
Don't work him too hard, Rock.

1265
01:14:10,077 --> 01:14:11,878
- Yeah.
- He's still a puppy.

1266
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:12,946
Come on, come on.

1267
01:14:14,015 --> 01:14:15,982
Close the distance. That's it.

1268
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:17,584
Yeah. One, two.

1269
01:14:18,819 --> 01:14:20,620
Good.

1270
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:22,489
Come on. Body, come here.

1271
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:24,993
Oh, yeah. Got a good hit.

1272
01:14:26,461 --> 01:14:28,160
Okay.

1273
01:14:28,162 --> 01:14:30,262
Come on.

1274
01:14:30,264 --> 01:14:33,833
Dig deep. Body, body, body. Good.

1275
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:38,972
You up to moving around?

1276
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:41,176
Take a break.

1277
01:14:46,081 --> 01:14:48,515
Oh. Hey, Unc, you all right?

1278
01:14:48,517 --> 01:14:49,682
- I'm all right.
- You okay?

1279
01:14:49,684 --> 01:14:50,851
I'm all right. It's out.

1280
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:52,018
I'm all right.

1281
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:53,085
All right.

1282
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:54,987
Just let me walk.

1283
01:14:54,989 --> 01:14:56,390
Just... I'm good.

1284
01:14:56,392 --> 01:14:57,758
- Sure?
- Yeah.

1285
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:01,128
Hey. What's wrong with you?

1286
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:02,896
I don't know. I don't know.

1287
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:04,097
Come here.

1288
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:05,665
Just let me walk.

1289
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:09,069
No, we got to call someone and
get you to the doctor, okay?

1290
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:10,302
- Okay.
- All right, come on.

1291
01:15:10,304 --> 01:15:11,504
- Off the rope.
- Easy.

1292
01:15:11,506 --> 01:15:13,874
Come on, I got you. Hey, Stitch!

1293
01:15:13,876 --> 01:15:15,408
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. What?

1294
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:18,244
- No, I'm really...
- Hey, somebody help!

1295
01:15:25,386 --> 01:15:26,654
Hi.

1296
01:15:26,656 --> 01:15:27,788
- Hi.
- Donnie.

1297
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:30,155
Dr. Kathari.

1298
01:15:30,157 --> 01:15:32,026
Mr. Balboa, how you feeling?

1299
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:34,194
I'm feeling good, real
good. I could go now.

1300
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:36,429
Heard you fell down. Was that
the first time you've fallen?

1301
01:15:36,431 --> 01:15:38,365
Well, without being punched.

1302
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,700
I'm gonna give you some more fluids.

1303
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:40,968
That should help you feel better.

1304
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:42,268
And we're gonna run
some tests in the morning

1305
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:43,837
- and get you out of here.
- Can you do this fast?

1306
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:45,371
Because we got a lot of stuff to do.

1307
01:15:45,373 --> 01:15:48,208
Just relax. All right? Go to sleep.

1308
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:50,377
- I'll check on you later.
- Thank you.

1309
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:53,446
Gotta do it fast. We have to...

1310
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:54,748
Donnie, we gotta train.

1311
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:57,651
Yeah, go to sleep.

1312
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:06,459
You guys need any more help?

1313
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:08,227
- No! We're good.
- No, we're good, thank you!

1314
01:16:08,229 --> 01:16:09,428
- You got it? What you need?
- Nothing.

1315
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:11,164
Thought you got lost for a minute.

1316
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:15,535
I have not seen food that look
like this in this house ever.

1317
01:16:15,537 --> 01:16:16,637
Yeah?

1318
01:16:16,639 --> 01:16:18,972
Yes. You know, usually everything

1319
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:21,374
I have has sauce or something on it.

1320
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:22,676
Get some of these collard greens.

1321
01:16:22,678 --> 01:16:24,210
All right. You just...

1322
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:25,811
- Just a little bit?
- Yeah, a little bit.

1323
01:16:25,813 --> 01:16:28,414
Bianca, you're beautiful

1324
01:16:28,416 --> 01:16:30,817
and I think you'll be a great singer.

1325
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:33,887
I think you're gonna be a
great champ, like your father.

1326
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:35,489
Maybe even better.

1327
01:16:35,491 --> 01:16:39,124
And for me, who's lucky enough
to be knowing both of you guys.

1328
01:16:39,126 --> 01:16:42,061
Here we go. <i>Cent'anni.</i> 100 years.

1329
01:16:42,063 --> 01:16:43,297
I'm honored.

1330
01:16:43,299 --> 01:16:45,399
Lucky me.

1331
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:48,768
Keep working on that shovel hook.

1332
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,070
Ah.

1333
01:16:50,072 --> 01:16:51,271
Right, that's it.

1334
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,841
Now, I wanna throw the
hook on the same side.

1335
01:16:53,843 --> 01:16:56,509
So you come up on the right,
you throw on the right.

1336
01:16:56,511 --> 01:16:59,646
Very good.

1337
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:02,015
A little more vicious than
that, little more power.

1338
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:05,186
Overdo it. Yeah! Very good.

1339
01:17:05,188 --> 01:17:07,219
Hey, Rock.

1340
01:17:07,221 --> 01:17:08,489
Yeah.

1341
01:17:08,491 --> 01:17:10,089
Good. You're looking good.

1342
01:17:10,091 --> 01:17:11,357
Are you getting jealous?

1343
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:14,328
Yeah, a little.

1344
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:18,966
- It's for you.
- Thanks.

1345
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:20,667
Hello? Yeah?

1346
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:22,671
Yeah.

1347
01:17:26,175 --> 01:17:28,307
Yeah, okay.

1348
01:17:28,309 --> 01:17:30,878
All right, thanks.

1349
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:39,287
Mr. Balboa.

1350
01:17:41,489 --> 01:17:45,558
Thanks for coming in on such short notice.

1351
01:17:47,028 --> 01:17:49,294
Well, we went through your test results

1352
01:17:49,296 --> 01:17:51,397
and your biopsy came back showing signs

1353
01:17:51,399 --> 01:17:55,968
of large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

1354
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:58,038
What's that do?

1355
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,276
Well, it's a form of cancer.

1356
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:11,051
I know that sounds scary,

1357
01:18:11,053 --> 01:18:13,619
but the good news is we caught it early.

1358
01:18:13,621 --> 01:18:16,589
However, we will have to remove
the tumor in your lymph nodes

1359
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:20,994
and start chemotherapy immediately.

1360
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:23,996
My wife tried that.

1361
01:18:23,998 --> 01:18:26,633
Mr. Balboa, as far as
options for treatment,

1362
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:28,067
this is the best plan of action.

1363
01:18:28,069 --> 01:18:30,404
No, I understand, but my wife tried that,

1364
01:18:30,406 --> 01:18:33,405
and I don't think I wanna do it.

1365
01:18:33,407 --> 01:18:35,708
Didn't turn out so good. But it's okay.

1366
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:37,143
With treatment, you'll still have

1367
01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:39,379
a very good chance of recovery.

1368
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:41,649
Without it...

1369
01:18:43,419 --> 01:18:45,918
I'm okay with it, really.

1370
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,753
Well, at least take these.

1371
01:18:47,755 --> 01:18:51,524
It has information on your
diagnosis and options for treatment.

1372
01:18:51,526 --> 01:18:54,427
- We can start...
- Thank you very much.

1373
01:18:54,429 --> 01:18:59,033
Listen, I'd appreciate if you
wouldn't say nothing to nobody, okay?

1374
01:19:04,806 --> 01:19:07,708
Oh, man! There's so much
traffic, you wouldn't believe it.

1375
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:09,610
That senior bus was running late, huh?

1376
01:19:09,612 --> 01:19:12,411
Hey, that's a cheap shot.

1377
01:19:12,413 --> 01:19:13,713
- It's the truth.
- Get in the ring.

1378
01:19:13,715 --> 01:19:15,615
- Hurry up and get ready.
- I've been ready.

1379
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:16,717
Good.

1380
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:18,185
I've been waiting on you.

1381
01:19:18,187 --> 01:19:22,791
Oh, come on, just put your gloves
on and stop talking so much.

1382
01:19:32,835 --> 01:19:33,999
We got a few things to do.

1383
01:19:35,069 --> 01:19:36,436
It's all about you.

1384
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:37,736
Mmm-hmm.

1385
01:19:37,738 --> 01:19:40,272
I already had my career. I did okay.

1386
01:19:40,274 --> 01:19:42,776
What's your excuse? You got no excuse.

1387
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:46,612
Now is the time for you to
rise to the occasion there.

1388
01:19:46,614 --> 01:19:48,080
- Just gonna put my...
- I can do it.

1389
01:19:48,082 --> 01:19:51,185
Okay, all right.

1390
01:19:51,187 --> 01:19:53,454
Now...

1391
01:19:53,456 --> 01:19:55,955
I want you to always, always, always

1392
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:57,423
pay attention to yourself first.

1393
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:58,624
Right.

1394
01:19:58,626 --> 01:20:01,160
If I'm not here to start
with, just start moving around.

1395
01:20:01,162 --> 01:20:02,462
All right. Mouthpiece.

1396
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,832
Know what I'm saying?

1397
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:07,601
Too many punches to the head, huh?

1398
01:20:07,603 --> 01:20:08,767
Yeah, whatever, Coach.

1399
01:20:08,769 --> 01:20:10,704
All right, get going there, champ.

1400
01:20:10,706 --> 01:20:11,937
Bell.

1401
01:20:11,939 --> 01:20:14,341
Come on, Creed!

1402
01:20:22,518 --> 01:20:25,053
Be first, Donnie. Come on!

1403
01:20:27,223 --> 01:20:28,321
All right, Amir.

1404
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:31,526
All right, champ. Don't work too hard.

1405
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:53,848
This shit for real?

1406
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:59,151
Doesn't matter.

1407
01:20:59,153 --> 01:21:01,853
What you should be thinking
about is that fight coming up.

1408
01:21:01,855 --> 01:21:04,124
That's the only thing that should
be on your mind, nothing else.

1409
01:21:04,126 --> 01:21:07,328
What you mean, don't think about
this? When you starting treatment?

1410
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:12,365
I'm not doing no chemotherapy. No.

1411
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:16,035
If you don't jump on this
quick, you're gonna end up dying.

1412
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:17,570
I know.

1413
01:21:17,572 --> 01:21:21,007
And you're all right with that?

1414
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:22,976
I am.

1415
01:21:22,978 --> 01:21:25,145
Man, you sound crazy,
man. Give me the keys.

1416
01:21:25,147 --> 01:21:26,445
I'll take you to the hospital right now.

1417
01:21:26,447 --> 01:21:27,614
I'm not crazy at all.

1418
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:30,017
If I could take everything that was good

1419
01:21:30,019 --> 01:21:32,652
and put it into a bowl or something

1420
01:21:32,654 --> 01:21:34,588
and say, "Hey! Here. I'd like to

1421
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:37,522
"buy one more day with my wife,"

1422
01:21:37,524 --> 01:21:38,758
I'd do it.

1423
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:42,594
I would die a happy man, right then.

1424
01:21:42,596 --> 01:21:45,332
Not gonna happen.

1425
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:53,774
So, everything I got has
moved on and I'm here.

1426
01:21:53,776 --> 01:21:56,976
But you know what? It's okay.

1427
01:21:56,978 --> 01:21:58,511
Because I said to myself,

1428
01:21:58,513 --> 01:22:01,380
"If I break, if I'm hurt, whatever.

1429
01:22:01,382 --> 01:22:03,549
"I ain't gonna fix it. Why bother?"

1430
01:22:03,551 --> 01:22:05,785
And I'm just some bum
just living in your crib,

1431
01:22:05,787 --> 01:22:07,152
just nothing.

1432
01:22:07,154 --> 01:22:09,321
You're a good kid, a good fighter.

1433
01:22:09,323 --> 01:22:11,790
But you got your whole future ahead of you.

1434
01:22:11,792 --> 01:22:13,795
Mine?

1435
01:22:15,163 --> 01:22:18,798
Back there, like all
them guys on that wall.

1436
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:22,200
In the back, in the past.

1437
01:22:22,202 --> 01:22:24,236
We're going nowhere.

1438
01:22:24,238 --> 01:22:26,806
I am to you just an old trainer.

1439
01:22:26,808 --> 01:22:30,442
That's what brought us together. You know?

1440
01:22:30,444 --> 01:22:32,913
We're not a real family.

1441
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:39,418
That was just in our heads, kid.

1442
01:22:48,662 --> 01:22:52,633
Oh, what'd you do? What'd you do?

1443
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:03,443
Why'd you say that?

1444
01:23:21,862 --> 01:23:24,698
Hey, what's up, Lil Creed?

1445
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,800
It's good.

1446
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:32,239
- Oh, hey!
- What's up, bro?

1447
01:23:32,241 --> 01:23:33,539
- Hey!
- What up?

1448
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:36,343
Hi!

1449
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:38,177
You okay?

1450
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:40,847
Yeah. How you doing? You good?

1451
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,649
Yeah, I'm good. I'm a little nervous.

1452
01:23:42,651 --> 01:23:45,151
There's just a lot of people here,
not really my crowd, you know?

1453
01:23:45,153 --> 01:23:46,253
Yeah, I can see.

1454
01:23:46,255 --> 01:23:48,355
Look, it's the boxing
boy, Lil Apollo Creed.

1455
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:49,888
I know his girl.

1456
01:23:49,890 --> 01:23:51,124
What's up, Bianca?

1457
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:52,191
Hey.

1458
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:53,560
You don't know nobody no more?

1459
01:23:53,562 --> 01:23:54,826
Nah, I said hello to
you when I walked past.

1460
01:23:54,828 --> 01:23:55,962
You didn't say nothing to me.

1461
01:23:55,964 --> 01:23:57,830
Yeah, I bet you did.
Stop acting light-skinned.

1462
01:23:57,832 --> 01:23:59,633
Hey, man, why don't you come
over here and grab this pic

1463
01:23:59,635 --> 01:24:01,034
with me real quick for the 'Gram?

1464
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:03,136
Yeah, that's cool.

1465
01:24:03,138 --> 01:24:05,070
Come on, man. You know he busy, man.

1466
01:24:05,072 --> 01:24:07,341
Welcome to my city, champ.

1467
01:24:08,676 --> 01:24:10,743
- There it is, Abbie.
- Believe dat.

1468
01:24:10,745 --> 01:24:12,244
Hey, good looking, Baby Creed.

1469
01:24:12,246 --> 01:24:13,646
Don't call me that.

1470
01:24:13,648 --> 01:24:15,414
Don't call you that? Don't call you what?

1471
01:24:15,416 --> 01:24:18,619
You just called me "Baby Creed."
I said, don't call me that.

1472
01:24:18,621 --> 01:24:20,587
Hey, fam, dig this. I
was showing you love, man.

1473
01:24:20,589 --> 01:24:21,855
You ain't got to come off like that.

1474
01:24:21,857 --> 01:24:23,356
Yeah, that's cool, that's
cool, that's all love.

1475
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:26,025
I know it's cool. You
definitely know it's cool.

1476
01:24:26,027 --> 01:24:28,227
When you talking to me, you
talking real tough, you feel me?

1477
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:29,995
Better talk to your little
pretty boy boyfriend, man.

1478
01:24:29,997 --> 01:24:32,566
Get a VIP pass next to your
pop, talking to me like that.

1479
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:33,665
No!

1480
01:24:33,667 --> 01:24:34,968
Hold up, nigga!

1481
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:37,704
Donnie! Donnie! Donnie!

1482
01:24:37,706 --> 01:24:41,574
Donnie! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1483
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:42,808
I'll kill your ass!

1484
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:44,843
Donnie! Donnie!

1485
01:24:44,845 --> 01:24:46,279
How's he doing?

1486
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:47,446
He's all right now.

1487
01:24:47,448 --> 01:24:49,214
- You know what happened?
- We had to separate him.

1488
01:24:49,216 --> 01:24:50,615
He was fighting with the other inmates.

1489
01:24:50,617 --> 01:24:51,985
Oh, no. Anybody get hurt?

1490
01:24:51,987 --> 01:24:53,453
Nah, nothing life-threatening.

1491
01:24:53,455 --> 01:24:55,489
- All right, thank you.
- No problem, champ.

1492
01:24:55,491 --> 01:24:57,457
Yeah.

1493
01:24:57,459 --> 01:24:59,760
Hey, Donnie.

1494
01:25:03,831 --> 01:25:06,966
How you doing, son?

1495
01:25:06,968 --> 01:25:09,302
I know a lot of cops and they said,

1496
01:25:09,304 --> 01:25:10,904
"Your friend's locked up."

1497
01:25:10,906 --> 01:25:14,642
Friends? You're just
a trainer to me, right?

1498
01:25:16,345 --> 01:25:19,012
I'm sorry about what I said
to you, back at the gym.

1499
01:25:19,014 --> 01:25:20,713
That was just me talking. I didn't mean it.

1500
01:25:20,715 --> 01:25:23,917
You just stay away from me.

1501
01:25:23,919 --> 01:25:24,984
Listen, Donnie...

1502
01:25:24,986 --> 01:25:26,953
- Man, don't touch me.
- Come on, what...

1503
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:29,222
Get your hands off me, old man!

1504
01:25:29,224 --> 01:25:33,359
Get your sick ass out of here!

1505
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:34,794
Leave!

1506
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:38,498
You here talking like you my family!
You got my real family killed!

1507
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:50,343
I ain't leaving

1508
01:25:50,345 --> 01:25:53,713
till I tell you what's on my mind.

1509
01:25:53,715 --> 01:25:55,949
You hate me, that's what it is.

1510
01:25:55,951 --> 01:25:57,784
Or maybe you're mad with somebody

1511
01:25:57,786 --> 01:26:02,621
who ain't here, Donnie,
who can't defend himself.

1512
01:26:02,623 --> 01:26:04,024
You know?

1513
01:26:04,026 --> 01:26:06,293
Now, I understand what you're
going through, young man.

1514
01:26:06,295 --> 01:26:07,494
I've been there.

1515
01:26:07,496 --> 01:26:09,928
And I know what it's
like to feel abandoned,

1516
01:26:09,930 --> 01:26:12,030
and be mad at everything.

1517
01:26:12,032 --> 01:26:15,735
And you're a better person than that.

1518
01:26:15,737 --> 01:26:19,172
Forgive him. Because there's
nothing you can do about it.

1519
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:22,575
It's taking a toll on you.

1520
01:26:24,711 --> 01:26:28,880
You're still caught in his shadow.

1521
01:26:28,882 --> 01:26:31,284
You got to move, Donnie.

1522
01:26:31,286 --> 01:26:33,688
Just leave, man.

1523
01:27:19,501 --> 01:27:22,303
Let's go, Johnson.

1524
01:27:47,028 --> 01:27:49,928
Bianca!

1525
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:52,063
Yo! Stop knocking on
my door like the police.

1526
01:27:52,065 --> 01:27:53,298
Can you at least let me apologize?

1527
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:54,633
No, it doesn't work like that.

1528
01:27:54,635 --> 01:27:56,602
You apologize when you spill
a drink on someone's shirt.

1529
01:27:56,604 --> 01:27:58,704
But you assaulted the headliner to my show,

1530
01:27:58,706 --> 01:28:01,140
a show I worked really hard to get.

1531
01:28:01,142 --> 01:28:03,276
What if I came to your
fight acting like an ass?

1532
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,645
Would that be cool with you?

1533
01:28:05,647 --> 01:28:07,747
Nah, I didn't think so.

1534
01:28:08,782 --> 01:28:12,451
How'd you do though? You kill it?

1535
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:14,253
Yeah, we did good.

1536
01:28:14,255 --> 01:28:16,588
I messed that up and I gotta
live with that, all right?

1537
01:28:16,590 --> 01:28:17,990
But I never meant to let you down.

1538
01:28:17,992 --> 01:28:20,058
Then what did you mean to do, D?

1539
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:22,964
Just have a little ego contest?

1540
01:28:28,370 --> 01:28:30,371
Rocky's sick.

1541
01:28:40,514 --> 01:28:41,746
He's got cancer.

1542
01:28:41,748 --> 01:28:44,316
I ain't trying to make excuses
for anything that I did,

1543
01:28:44,318 --> 01:28:46,485
but I found out right before your show.

1544
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:48,087
How bad is it?

1545
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:52,727
They want him to start chemo but,
you know, he's too macho to do that.

1546
01:28:53,862 --> 01:28:55,897
Jesus.

1547
01:28:59,033 --> 01:29:03,270
Well, maybe you can
talk some sense into him.

1548
01:29:03,272 --> 01:29:06,607
I don't think he'd wanna
hear anything I got to say.

1549
01:29:09,109 --> 01:29:11,844
Yeah, well, give him my love.

1550
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:15,550
Hey, Bianca, don't close me out right now.

1551
01:29:16,751 --> 01:29:18,651
Look, we both got a lot going on right now

1552
01:29:18,653 --> 01:29:20,219
so I think you should focus on yours

1553
01:29:20,221 --> 01:29:21,286
and I'm gonna focus on mine.

1554
01:29:21,288 --> 01:29:23,690
I'm sorry.

1555
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:25,958
What's that mean?

1556
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:29,695
I get it, I messed up.

1557
01:29:29,697 --> 01:29:33,499
I trusted you! Can you
please not shut me out?

1558
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:39,504
I'm sorry, okay?

1559
01:29:39,506 --> 01:29:42,143
I need you right now.

1560
01:30:16,545 --> 01:30:18,477
Nigga, what's up?

1561
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:20,413
What's up?

1562
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:23,517
Hey, I heard you Apollo Creed's son.

1563
01:30:26,019 --> 01:30:29,088
Yeah.

1564
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:31,358
That's what's up.

1565
01:31:14,501 --> 01:31:16,201
Look like you lost five pounds.

1566
01:31:16,203 --> 01:31:18,938
You ought to sit down and eat.

1567
01:31:31,952 --> 01:31:33,785
I mean, what I look like?

1568
01:31:33,787 --> 01:31:37,692
Letting you train me while
you sit around and die?

1569
01:31:41,795 --> 01:31:44,463
Just like any other fight.

1570
01:31:44,465 --> 01:31:49,602
This fight? I seen it before.

1571
01:31:49,604 --> 01:31:53,472
It gets as bad as it can get

1572
01:31:53,474 --> 01:31:56,040
and most of the time, you don't win it.

1573
01:31:56,042 --> 01:31:57,377
Yeah, but I don't care.

1574
01:31:57,379 --> 01:31:59,779
I ain't training if you
don't get the treatment.

1575
01:31:59,781 --> 01:32:02,817
So if I fight, you fight.

1576
01:32:34,882 --> 01:32:36,783
- Hey.
- What's up?

1577
01:32:36,785 --> 01:32:38,618
You been to the gym?

1578
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:40,018
Nah, I've been here.

1579
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:43,356
Okay. Here you go. Remember this?

1580
01:32:43,358 --> 01:32:45,524
Get up.

1581
01:32:45,526 --> 01:32:46,825
- Ready?
- What's...

1582
01:32:46,827 --> 01:32:48,393
I want you to shadow box.

1583
01:32:48,395 --> 01:32:50,730
This is a nice room,
let's see you move around.

1584
01:32:50,732 --> 01:32:51,864
You're serious?

1585
01:32:51,866 --> 01:32:52,932
Want me to do it for you?

1586
01:32:52,934 --> 01:32:53,999
No. It's all good.

1587
01:32:54,001 --> 01:32:55,767
- Yeah, ready?
- Come on.

1588
01:32:55,769 --> 01:32:58,237
Time!

1589
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:00,541
There you go.

1590
01:33:06,848 --> 01:33:08,414
We used to do that with one hand.

1591
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:12,450
I don't wanna say anything though.

1592
01:33:12,452 --> 01:33:14,786
Two...

1593
01:33:16,657 --> 01:33:17,856
Don't hit the lady.

1594
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:21,127
She'll probably drop you.

1595
01:33:31,238 --> 01:33:32,838
All right. Come on, almost there.

1596
01:33:34,274 --> 01:33:36,376
Come on, Unc.

1597
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:43,584
Oh, God.

1598
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:18,419
Come on, let's go.

1599
01:34:21,723 --> 01:34:22,887
Yeah, yes!

1600
01:34:22,889 --> 01:34:25,925
That's your thing, yes! More! Yes!

1601
01:34:28,162 --> 01:34:29,596
One. Two? The deal was two!

1602
01:34:29,598 --> 01:34:30,663
I can't, no.

1603
01:34:30,665 --> 01:34:32,933
I'm dizzy.

1604
01:34:42,876 --> 01:34:44,043
Double jab.

1605
01:34:44,045 --> 01:34:46,279
Step on right under there.

1606
01:34:52,854 --> 01:34:54,352
Good.

1607
01:34:54,354 --> 01:34:55,887
At least we got the speed.

1608
01:34:55,889 --> 01:35:00,827
We just need him to sit down so
when he hits something, he breaks it.

1609
01:35:02,996 --> 01:35:04,362
Good.

1610
01:35:04,364 --> 01:35:08,066
Step with it, you gotta
step with it. Come on!

1611
01:35:08,068 --> 01:35:09,368
Little bit more.

1612
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:11,404
Little bit more, dig down. Good.

1613
01:35:11,406 --> 01:35:13,239
Good. Keep it right.

1614
01:35:13,241 --> 01:35:15,807
Yes!

1615
01:35:15,809 --> 01:35:16,976
Look, he's doing the same thing.

1616
01:35:16,978 --> 01:35:18,576
Yeah, he does, it looks that way.

1617
01:35:18,578 --> 01:35:22,215
But I think he's got something
up his sleeve for you.

1618
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:37,029
Wow, beautiful.

1619
01:35:37,031 --> 01:35:38,731
Yo, you going to see Rock?

1620
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:40,865
Yeah, let's go! We got you! Let's go!

1621
01:35:40,867 --> 01:35:43,736
Make history, Creed! Let's go!

1622
01:35:46,573 --> 01:35:49,607
What up? Come on, y'all!
Let's ride! Come on!

1623
01:35:49,609 --> 01:35:50,875
That's what I like, man!

1624
01:35:50,877 --> 01:35:54,848
Let's go see Rock on
Front Street! Ride with me!

1625
01:37:42,956 --> 01:37:45,358
You wanna say hello?

1626
01:37:46,394 --> 01:37:48,026
Place looks like a church.

1627
01:37:48,028 --> 01:37:49,561
Yeah, feel like an art museum.

1628
01:37:49,563 --> 01:37:51,763
Yeah, beautiful.

1629
01:37:51,765 --> 01:37:54,167
The fight starts in about two minutes.

1630
01:37:54,169 --> 01:37:56,267
As soon as he shows up,
he's gonna start on you.

1631
01:37:56,269 --> 01:37:59,271
Okay.

1632
01:38:12,519 --> 01:38:14,119
Don't let him get to you.

1633
01:38:14,121 --> 01:38:16,088
Okay, great. Thank you all for coming.

1634
01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:18,790
Let's get straight into questions.

1635
01:38:18,792 --> 01:38:20,959
Uh, young lady to the left.

1636
01:38:20,961 --> 01:38:23,928
Conlan, can we expect any
more fireworks at the weigh-in?

1637
01:38:23,930 --> 01:38:25,731
I've been doing some
anger management classes

1638
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:27,833
and trying to control that temper of mine.

1639
01:38:27,835 --> 01:38:30,069
I just gotta make sure he
forgets it all by Saturday night.

1640
01:38:32,773 --> 01:38:34,306
Okay, next question.

1641
01:38:34,308 --> 01:38:35,774
Young man in the glasses.

1642
01:38:35,776 --> 01:38:38,043
What about the contrast between you two?

1643
01:38:38,045 --> 01:38:39,744
You, the overnight success versus

1644
01:38:39,746 --> 01:38:41,813
Conlan's rags to riches background.

1645
01:38:41,815 --> 01:38:42,981
Nothing happened overnight.

1646
01:38:42,983 --> 01:38:44,350
I've been fighting for some time now...

1647
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:46,118
That's exactly how it
happened for this guy.

1648
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:49,320
He's an overnight success, never
had a damn fight in his life.

1649
01:38:49,322 --> 01:38:51,890
He's got this shot because
he found that name last night.

1650
01:38:51,892 --> 01:38:54,625
One more. There's a lot of
talk about legacy in this fight.

1651
01:38:54,627 --> 01:38:56,195
Johnson, can you speak to that?

1652
01:38:56,197 --> 01:38:58,364
Yeah, I've been working on
trying to build my own legacy.

1653
01:38:58,366 --> 01:39:00,966
Legacy? Are we at some kind of comedy club?

1654
01:39:00,968 --> 01:39:02,133
The guy next to him,

1655
01:39:02,135 --> 01:39:04,203
now that's what we're talking about legacy.

1656
01:39:04,205 --> 01:39:05,670
- And I'm cut from that cloth.
- Don't fall for it.

1657
01:39:05,672 --> 01:39:07,740
My father worked on the docks.

1658
01:39:07,742 --> 01:39:09,842
His father was heavyweight
champion of the world.

1659
01:39:09,844 --> 01:39:11,575
People like Silver Spoon over there...

1660
01:39:11,577 --> 01:39:12,878
You don't know nothing about me.

1661
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,146
I know enough about you.

1662
01:39:14,148 --> 01:39:15,414
- I'm here now though.
- You found yourself here.

1663
01:39:15,416 --> 01:39:16,682
- I'm here now.
- You a false Creed.

1664
01:39:16,684 --> 01:39:18,383
All right, I'll show you
right now. My pops ain't here.

1665
01:39:18,385 --> 01:39:19,517
Sit down!

1666
01:39:19,519 --> 01:39:20,886
You wanna fight here? I'll do it right now!

1667
01:39:20,888 --> 01:39:23,155
I can do it right now,
bitch! We can do it right now!

1668
01:39:24,657 --> 01:39:25,825
"Creed" my asshole!

1669
01:39:25,827 --> 01:39:26,924
Keep it down!

1670
01:39:26,926 --> 01:39:28,326
Yo, you okay? Good?

1671
01:39:28,328 --> 01:39:29,661
Yeah, I'm all right.

1672
01:39:29,663 --> 01:39:31,730
Okay, we'll see what's up.

1673
01:39:31,732 --> 01:39:35,234
I'm gonna knock that smile off your face.

1674
01:39:40,273 --> 01:39:43,410
Yo, Donnie, it's Rock.

1675
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:48,280
Unc, you okay?

1676
01:39:48,282 --> 01:39:50,716
Yeah, I'm good. Just couldn't sleep.

1677
01:39:50,718 --> 01:39:51,850
Yeah, me either.

1678
01:39:51,852 --> 01:39:53,185
Is it okay I sit down?

1679
01:39:53,187 --> 01:39:55,454
Course.

1680
01:39:55,456 --> 01:39:57,556
Donnie...

1681
01:39:57,558 --> 01:40:00,758
I'd like you to do me a
favor when all this is over.

1682
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:02,494
- Yeah, anything.
- Okay, good.

1683
01:40:02,496 --> 01:40:04,396
It's not important but just...

1684
01:40:04,398 --> 01:40:06,065
I wanna lock it in, okay?

1685
01:40:06,067 --> 01:40:07,600
Yeah, you got it.

1686
01:40:07,602 --> 01:40:09,735
There you go.

1687
01:40:12,273 --> 01:40:13,739
You okay, huh?

1688
01:40:13,741 --> 01:40:16,475
Yeah, why?

1689
01:40:16,477 --> 01:40:18,444
No, you keep looking at the door.

1690
01:40:18,446 --> 01:40:20,945
No!

1691
01:40:20,947 --> 01:40:23,382
Mmm-mmm.

1692
01:40:25,419 --> 01:40:27,418
Do you hear something?

1693
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:28,920
No.

1694
01:40:31,158 --> 01:40:32,824
Who is that?

1695
01:40:32,826 --> 01:40:35,261
I don't know.

1696
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:43,268
How you doing, Bianca?
What are you doing here?

1697
01:40:43,270 --> 01:40:44,369
Y'all two are killing me.

1698
01:40:48,975 --> 01:40:50,843
Oh, and listen. Would you guys just keep...

1699
01:40:50,845 --> 01:40:52,143
We know.

1700
01:40:52,145 --> 01:40:53,411
- Leg thing.
- Yeah.

1701
01:40:53,413 --> 01:40:54,914
- The legs, yeah.
- It's important.

1702
01:40:54,916 --> 01:40:56,080
Got you.

1703
01:41:00,955 --> 01:41:03,188
You wanna come in?

1704
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:04,655
Yeah.

1705
01:41:04,657 --> 01:41:06,826
Please.

1706
01:41:21,174 --> 01:41:22,374
- I got it.
- Good.

1707
01:41:22,376 --> 01:41:25,511
All right.

1708
01:41:25,513 --> 01:41:27,680
All right.

1709
01:41:30,917 --> 01:41:32,985
A lot of room.

1710
01:41:32,987 --> 01:41:35,887
Didn't we have enough
surprises for one weekend?

1711
01:41:35,889 --> 01:41:38,325
That's not me.

1712
01:42:09,389 --> 01:42:12,458
Very nice colors.

1713
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:16,628
Why don't you take 'em into the
other room and see how well they fit.

1714
01:42:18,666 --> 01:42:20,667
Yeah.

1715
01:42:22,002 --> 01:42:23,334
Hey, champ.

1716
01:42:23,336 --> 01:42:26,204
All right, Donnie. I'm proud of you.

1717
01:42:26,206 --> 01:42:29,008
That's gonna bring him luck.

1718
01:42:50,964 --> 01:42:53,632
You never been in front of
this many people before, right?

1719
01:42:53,634 --> 01:42:54,966
That don't matter.

1720
01:42:54,968 --> 01:42:57,268
You've never been this far away from home.

1721
01:42:57,270 --> 01:42:58,704
That don't matter.

1722
01:42:58,706 --> 01:43:01,940
What matters is what you leave in that ring

1723
01:43:01,942 --> 01:43:04,109
and what you take back with you.

1724
01:43:04,111 --> 01:43:05,744
You know what that is?

1725
01:43:05,746 --> 01:43:08,679
Pride. And knowing that you did your best.

1726
01:43:08,681 --> 01:43:10,649
And you're doing it for yourself.

1727
01:43:10,651 --> 01:43:15,219
Not for me, not your
father's memory, but for you.

1728
01:43:15,221 --> 01:43:17,388
I can see in your eyes

1729
01:43:17,390 --> 01:43:20,825
you're gonna do it.

1730
01:43:20,827 --> 01:43:22,127
Let's go now.

1731
01:43:22,129 --> 01:43:24,730
Padman.

1732
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:29,835
Fight's right here.

1733
01:43:31,839 --> 01:43:34,006
Let's go.

1734
01:43:36,844 --> 01:43:38,410
Yeah.

1735
01:43:38,412 --> 01:43:40,714
Left hook combination.

1736
01:43:42,349 --> 01:43:43,816
- Yeah.
- Come on, man. There you go!

1737
01:43:43,818 --> 01:43:46,584
Go up top.

1738
01:43:46,586 --> 01:43:48,419
All right, guys, it's time.

1739
01:43:48,421 --> 01:43:50,321
Let's go win a championship!

1740
01:43:50,323 --> 01:43:53,359
- It's time, baby.
- Let's go, guys.

1741
01:43:56,363 --> 01:43:58,598
Come on, man.

1742
01:44:03,970 --> 01:44:06,205
Let's go.

1743
01:44:22,855 --> 01:44:25,190
I'd always get nervous
during times like this,

1744
01:44:25,192 --> 01:44:28,360
but that's normal, and
it's gonna give you energy.

1745
01:44:28,362 --> 01:44:31,498
Pretty normal. Very normal.

1746
01:45:33,292 --> 01:45:36,429
Go up there and show him who you are!

1747
01:45:40,233 --> 01:45:42,769
Conlan!

1748
01:46:00,787 --> 01:46:03,355
This is what you wanted, and what you got.

1749
01:46:03,357 --> 01:46:06,993
And I want you to enjoy it, okay? Do that.

1750
01:46:09,563 --> 01:46:14,868
Conlan! Conlan!

1751
01:47:24,037 --> 01:47:27,172
<i>Hello again. I'm Jim Lampley.
Here comes Ricky Conlan.</i>

1752
01:47:27,174 --> 01:47:30,741
<i>100,000 on their feet for
what may conceivably be</i>

1753
01:47:30,743 --> 01:47:33,543
<i>his last walk to the ring
for a professional fight.</i>

1754
01:47:33,545 --> 01:47:37,382
<i>Max Kellerman, what chance
does the young American have?</i>

1755
01:47:37,384 --> 01:47:39,918
<i>He's got the name. That's
why he's here tonight.</i>

1756
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:41,686
<i>Does he have the game?</i>

1757
01:47:41,688 --> 01:47:44,890
<i>He's Apollo Creed's son, he's
got Rocky Balboa in his corner.</i>

1758
01:47:44,892 --> 01:47:46,725
<i>But all the legends in the world</i>

1759
01:47:46,727 --> 01:47:49,695
<i>can't help him tonight
if he can't fight.</i>

1760
01:47:49,697 --> 01:47:54,333
<i>The question is, can he fight?</i>

1761
01:48:16,288 --> 01:48:19,290
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Goodison Park</i>

1762
01:48:19,292 --> 01:48:21,793
<i>here in Liverpool, England,</i>

1763
01:48:21,795 --> 01:48:24,896
<i>where tonight this
is the main event.</i>

1764
01:48:24,898 --> 01:48:27,030
<i>Twelve rounds of boxing</i>

1765
01:48:27,032 --> 01:48:30,468
<i>for the light heavyweight
championship of the world.</i>

1766
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:32,737
<i>For the thousands in attendance</i>

1767
01:48:32,739 --> 01:48:35,707
<i>and the millions watching
around the world,</i>

1768
01:48:35,709 --> 01:48:37,174
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1769
01:48:37,176 --> 01:48:40,647
<i>let's get ready to rumble!</i>

1770
01:48:44,218 --> 01:48:47,319
<i>In the red corner, wearing
the stars and stripes,</i>

1771
01:48:47,321 --> 01:48:51,655
<i>his professional record,
16 fights 16 victories.</i>

1772
01:48:51,657 --> 01:48:53,057
<i>The challenger,</i>

1773
01:48:53,059 --> 01:48:58,730
<i>Adonis "Hollywood" Creed!</i>

1774
01:48:58,732 --> 01:49:01,231
<i>And fighting out of the blue corner,</i>

1775
01:49:01,233 --> 01:49:02,968
<i>wearing black with blue,</i>

1776
01:49:02,970 --> 01:49:05,003
<i>with 36 fights,</i>

1777
01:49:05,005 --> 01:49:06,672
<i>28 KOs,</i>

1778
01:49:06,674 --> 01:49:09,973
<i>he's the light heavyweight
champion of the world,</i>

1779
01:49:09,975 --> 01:49:17,450
<i>"Pretty" Ricky Conlan!</i>

1780
01:49:22,855 --> 01:49:25,457
- Okay, let's go.
- Mmm-hmm.

1781
01:49:30,063 --> 01:49:32,230
<i>How you doing, lads? You know
what I expect of you both.</i>

1782
01:49:32,232 --> 01:49:33,765
<i>We talked about it
in the locker rooms.</i>

1783
01:49:33,767 --> 01:49:34,932
<i>I want you to protect yourselves</i>

1784
01:49:34,934 --> 01:49:36,701
<i>and obey my commands at all times.</i>

1785
01:49:36,703 --> 01:49:38,770
<i>No low blows, no silly business.</i>

1786
01:49:38,772 --> 01:49:41,039
<i>Keep it clean, will you? Understand?</i>

1787
01:49:41,041 --> 01:49:42,874
<i>Touch gloves.</i>

1788
01:49:42,876 --> 01:49:44,208
Nice shorts, boy.

1789
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:48,045
Too bad your daddy ain't
here to fight in them.

1790
01:49:48,047 --> 01:49:49,547
You know what?

1791
01:49:49,549 --> 01:49:53,252
You're gonna close his big mouth, okay?

1792
01:49:55,555 --> 01:49:57,121
- You know what to do.
- Mmm-hmm.

1793
01:49:57,123 --> 01:50:00,057
One step, one punch, one round at a time.

1794
01:50:00,059 --> 01:50:02,194
You got this.

1795
01:50:13,607 --> 01:50:15,405
<i>Round one begins.</i>

1796
01:50:15,407 --> 01:50:17,875
<i>"Pretty" Ricky Conlan
in the black trunks,</i>

1797
01:50:17,877 --> 01:50:21,279
<i>and Adonis Creed in the
red, white and blue.</i>

1798
01:50:21,281 --> 01:50:24,182
<i>Conlan is significantly taller</i>

1799
01:50:24,184 --> 01:50:26,718
<i>and thinks it will be
easy to use his jab</i>

1800
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:28,619
<i>to keep young Creed at bay.</i>

1801
01:50:28,621 --> 01:50:29,987
<i>You can see right away, Jim,</i>

1802
01:50:29,989 --> 01:50:32,257
<i>how much more relaxed Conlan
is. He's been there before.</i>

1803
01:50:32,259 --> 01:50:33,790
Move your head!

1804
01:50:33,792 --> 01:50:35,093
Keep your left up!

1805
01:50:35,095 --> 01:50:36,427
<i>That kind of nervous energy</i>

1806
01:50:36,429 --> 01:50:38,061
<i>can wear you out as
the fight goes on.</i>

1807
01:50:38,063 --> 01:50:39,931
<i>Hard left hook by
Conlan. Creed backs off.</i>

1808
01:50:39,933 --> 01:50:41,699
<i>It's not easy to
just jump right into</i>

1809
01:50:41,701 --> 01:50:43,267
<i>the major leagues like this,</i>

1810
01:50:43,269 --> 01:50:45,036
<i>having never fought an
opponent like Conlan.</i>

1811
01:50:45,038 --> 01:50:47,405
<i>Of course, there aren't
many fighters like Conlan.</i>

1812
01:50:47,407 --> 01:50:50,241
<i>Creed trying to get close to
Conlan, against the ropes.</i>

1813
01:50:50,243 --> 01:50:53,410
<i>Conlan easily puts distance
between them again.</i>

1814
01:50:53,412 --> 01:50:55,812
<i>Creed lands a jab,
Conlan grins at it.</i>

1815
01:50:55,814 --> 01:50:57,481
<i>Conlan fires a hard body punch,</i>

1816
01:50:57,483 --> 01:50:59,049
<i>hits him hard with a right cross</i>

1817
01:50:59,051 --> 01:51:00,852
<i>and backs Creed into the ropes.</i>

1818
01:51:00,854 --> 01:51:02,553
- Break!
- Ref, come on!

1819
01:51:02,555 --> 01:51:03,887
Keep it clean!

1820
01:51:03,889 --> 01:51:05,323
<i>And he gets a warning
from the referee.</i>

1821
01:51:05,325 --> 01:51:07,258
<i>Creed kinda woke him
up with that shot</i>

1822
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:09,660
<i>and Conlan really
made him pay for it.</i>

1823
01:51:09,662 --> 01:51:12,798
<i>Creed ready to let his hands go.</i>

1824
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:14,732
<i>Creed misses and gets hit in return.</i>

1825
01:51:14,734 --> 01:51:16,735
To your corner! One!

1826
01:51:16,737 --> 01:51:18,136
<i>Perfect uppercut on the inside.</i>

1827
01:51:18,138 --> 01:51:19,337
- <i>Down goes Creed.</i>
- Two!

1828
01:51:19,339 --> 01:51:20,838
- Three! Four!
- I'm good. I'm good!

1829
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:22,740
- Five! Six!
- I'm good!

1830
01:51:22,742 --> 01:51:24,208
Shake it off!

1831
01:51:24,210 --> 01:51:26,076
<i>But already a knockdown
for Ricky Conlan.</i>

1832
01:51:26,078 --> 01:51:27,145
- Are you okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1833
01:51:27,147 --> 01:51:28,245
- Are you sure?
- I'm good!

1834
01:51:28,247 --> 01:51:30,248
Fight!

1835
01:51:31,917 --> 01:51:34,084
<i>Conlan lands a shot after the bell,</i>

1836
01:51:34,086 --> 01:51:36,120
<i>and round one was all Ricky Conlan.</i>

1837
01:51:36,122 --> 01:51:39,958
Real for you now, boy? Real for you now?

1838
01:51:42,862 --> 01:51:44,462
- How's the eye?
- Little bloody.

1839
01:51:44,464 --> 01:51:46,129
All right, look. Don't get rattled.

1840
01:51:46,131 --> 01:51:47,498
I'm gonna knock his ass out.

1841
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:49,034
Do it in the next round. Don't wait.

1842
01:51:49,036 --> 01:51:50,468
You keep making mistakes like that,

1843
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:52,570
we're gonna pick you up
with a vacuum cleaner, okay?

1844
01:51:52,572 --> 01:51:55,942
<i>Adonis was lucky there wasn't
another 30 seconds in that round.</i>

1845
01:51:57,242 --> 01:51:59,143
Come on, baby. What you doing?

1846
01:51:59,145 --> 01:52:01,012
Here's what I want you to do.

1847
01:52:01,014 --> 01:52:03,146
He's gonna jab and throw the right.

1848
01:52:03,148 --> 01:52:06,084
When he leaves it out there, drop
that right hook and smash him, okay?

1849
01:52:06,086 --> 01:52:07,752
Stay focused.

1850
01:52:07,754 --> 01:52:10,588
<i>So round one was a forbidding
experience for young Adonis Creed.</i>

1851
01:52:10,590 --> 01:52:13,790
<i>And now, after a discussion with
Rocky Balboa between rounds,</i>

1852
01:52:13,792 --> 01:52:15,526
<i>he comes in for more.</i>

1853
01:52:15,528 --> 01:52:18,896
<i>Conlan showed his power with the
uppercut at the end of round one,</i>

1854
01:52:18,898 --> 01:52:21,466
<i>goes back to boxing
to begin the second.</i>

1855
01:52:21,468 --> 01:52:22,601
Be first!

1856
01:52:22,603 --> 01:52:23,768
Keep the pressure on, Rick!

1857
01:52:23,770 --> 01:52:25,869
<i>Logic says Creed needs to find</i>

1858
01:52:25,871 --> 01:52:28,005
<i>a way to get inside
of Conlan's long arms</i>

1859
01:52:28,007 --> 01:52:30,040
<i>and create pressure on the inside.</i>

1860
01:52:30,042 --> 01:52:31,308
Come on! Come on!

1861
01:52:31,310 --> 01:52:34,678
<i>So far, it's still
mostly Ricky Conlan.</i>

1862
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:36,380
<i>Hard left hook for Conlan, uppercut.</i>

1863
01:52:36,382 --> 01:52:37,615
Keep your hands up!

1864
01:52:37,617 --> 01:52:39,051
<i>Drives Creed into the corner again.</i>

1865
01:52:39,053 --> 01:52:41,352
Tie him up!

1866
01:52:41,354 --> 01:52:44,789
<i>Creed wraps him up and pulls
him in to stop the onslaught.</i>

1867
01:52:44,791 --> 01:52:46,725
You the champ, right, huh?

1868
01:52:46,727 --> 01:52:48,125
You the champ?

1869
01:52:48,127 --> 01:52:50,161
Show me. Come on!

1870
01:52:51,630 --> 01:52:53,998
<i>There's a perfect
right-hand shot by Creed!</i>

1871
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,435
- Yeah!
- Yes!

1872
01:52:58,505 --> 01:53:01,571
<i>Creed misses wildly, and
they are going toe-to-toe.</i>

1873
01:53:01,573 --> 01:53:03,575
<i>Rapidly becoming a
phone booth fight!</i>

1874
01:53:03,577 --> 01:53:04,875
Go! Go!

1875
01:53:04,877 --> 01:53:06,911
<i>Trading punches,
right hand, left hand!</i>

1876
01:53:06,913 --> 01:53:08,178
<i>Both guys landing!</i>

1877
01:53:08,180 --> 01:53:09,746
<i>This is unbelievable action!</i>

1878
01:53:09,748 --> 01:53:11,249
Double hook! Come on!

1879
01:53:11,251 --> 01:53:13,383
<i>Hard right hand by Creed.</i>

1880
01:53:13,385 --> 01:53:14,651
You bleed just like me!

1881
01:53:14,653 --> 01:53:15,887
Go to your corners! Come on!

1882
01:53:15,889 --> 01:53:17,054
You bleed just like me!

1883
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:19,290
Man! That ain't shit!

1884
01:53:19,292 --> 01:53:21,325
<i>He loves it! If Conlan thought</i>

1885
01:53:21,327 --> 01:53:23,261
<i>he had a pushover,
he knows better now!</i>

1886
01:53:23,263 --> 01:53:24,494
He bleed like me!

1887
01:53:24,496 --> 01:53:25,696
You belong in here!

1888
01:53:25,698 --> 01:53:27,499
They don't know what you've been through

1889
01:53:27,501 --> 01:53:29,334
and they sure don't know
what we've been through.

1890
01:53:29,336 --> 01:53:30,901
I don't want you trading blows with him.

1891
01:53:30,903 --> 01:53:32,837
I want you to protect yourself.

1892
01:53:32,839 --> 01:53:34,070
Keep your distance!

1893
01:53:34,072 --> 01:53:35,406
I'm gonna smash this kid to bits.

1894
01:53:35,408 --> 01:53:37,542
Now he knows you're for real.

1895
01:53:37,544 --> 01:53:38,877
You gotta believe you can do it.

1896
01:53:38,879 --> 01:53:41,012
<i>That was such a big round for Creed.</i>

1897
01:53:41,014 --> 01:53:43,914
<i>Not just on the scorecards but
psychologically going forward, Jim.</i>

1898
01:53:43,916 --> 01:53:45,415
You woke up a sleeping giant.

1899
01:53:45,417 --> 01:53:47,451
He's gonna come after you
with everything he's got.

1900
01:53:47,453 --> 01:53:50,221
<i>Adonis, looking more and more
comfortable against the champ</i>

1901
01:53:50,223 --> 01:53:53,591
<i>seems to have found his rhythm.</i>

1902
01:53:53,593 --> 01:53:55,961
Go finish him off.

1903
01:53:58,063 --> 01:53:59,597
<i>This has devolved into a slugfest!</i>

1904
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:00,699
One punch at a time!

1905
01:54:00,701 --> 01:54:02,033
Come on, D!

1906
01:54:02,035 --> 01:54:04,768
<i>Conlan trying to punish
Creed at short range.</i>

1907
01:54:04,770 --> 01:54:05,971
Finish him now!

1908
01:54:05,973 --> 01:54:08,772
<i>Big combination to end
the third by Conlan</i>

1909
01:54:08,774 --> 01:54:10,374
<i>and Creed does not know where he is,</i>

1910
01:54:10,376 --> 01:54:12,177
<i>walking to the wrong corner there.</i>

1911
01:54:12,179 --> 01:54:13,378
His arm is long.

1912
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:15,746
Because you're playing his game, Donnie.

1913
01:54:15,748 --> 01:54:16,813
Be patient.

1914
01:54:16,815 --> 01:54:18,783
One step, one punch.

1915
01:54:18,785 --> 01:54:20,418
- One round at a time.
- There you go.

1916
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:22,320
<i>One step, one punch,</i>

1917
01:54:22,322 --> 01:54:24,289
<i>one round at a time.</i>

1918
01:54:24,291 --> 01:54:27,057
<i>Round five of a scheduled 12 and
already it's a far different fight</i>

1919
01:54:27,059 --> 01:54:28,526
<i>than most experts expected.</i>

1920
01:54:28,528 --> 01:54:29,694
He's just a pretender.

1921
01:54:29,696 --> 01:54:31,561
He's lucky to be in the same
ring with you hitting him.

1922
01:54:31,563 --> 01:54:32,629
Remember that.

1923
01:54:32,631 --> 01:54:34,198
<i>Adonis Creed has succeeded in</i>

1924
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:38,203
<i>pressuring Ricky Conlan
and making him fight.</i>

1925
01:55:00,193 --> 01:55:02,192
<i>Creed has proven
plenty in this fight.</i>

1926
01:55:02,194 --> 01:55:04,195
<i>He's taken it, he's given it back.</i>

1927
01:55:04,197 --> 01:55:06,164
<i>But he does not look like a match</i>

1928
01:55:06,166 --> 01:55:07,999
<i>for the best pound-for-pound
fighter in the world.</i>

1929
01:55:08,001 --> 01:55:09,467
You're going through hell out there

1930
01:55:09,469 --> 01:55:10,634
but you're hurting him, too.

1931
01:55:10,636 --> 01:55:12,003
I can see it in his eyes.

1932
01:55:12,005 --> 01:55:13,670
You're not as far behind as you think.

1933
01:55:13,672 --> 01:55:15,707
Shorten that jab, shorten the distance,

1934
01:55:15,709 --> 01:55:17,874
get underneath him, and
you'll be able to rip him.

1935
01:55:17,876 --> 01:55:19,343
You gotta push him back.

1936
01:55:19,345 --> 01:55:22,379
<i>Most critics didn't think
Creed could make it this far.</i>

1937
01:55:22,381 --> 01:55:24,416
Donnie, step under!

1938
01:55:25,685 --> 01:55:27,384
- Yes!
- Come on, Ricky!

1939
01:55:27,386 --> 01:55:29,954
<i>There are moments when Creed
is assertively taking over.</i>

1940
01:55:29,956 --> 01:55:31,489
<i>But there's a hard counter right,</i>

1941
01:55:31,491 --> 01:55:33,124
<i>drives Creed back into the corner.</i>

1942
01:55:33,126 --> 01:55:35,125
<i>Just when it appears Creed
might be taking control</i>

1943
01:55:35,127 --> 01:55:37,361
<i>Conlan comes close
to knocking him down.</i>

1944
01:55:37,363 --> 01:55:38,495
Use that pressure.

1945
01:55:38,497 --> 01:55:39,931
You are the one that's in the driving seat.

1946
01:55:39,933 --> 01:55:41,399
He's not used to this level, all right?

1947
01:55:41,401 --> 01:55:42,967
Get 'em on the rope.

1948
01:55:42,969 --> 01:55:44,768
Get 'em on the rope! Deep breath.

1949
01:55:44,770 --> 01:55:45,904
Boy's fast.

1950
01:55:45,906 --> 01:55:48,339
Hey! It's you against you.

1951
01:55:48,341 --> 01:55:49,908
- Me against me.
- That's right.

1952
01:55:49,910 --> 01:55:51,308
- He's just in your way.
- Got it.

1953
01:55:51,310 --> 01:55:52,810
Get him out of the way! Let's go!

1954
01:55:52,812 --> 01:55:56,213
<i>Not only is young Adonis
Creed still in the ring,</i>

1955
01:55:56,215 --> 01:55:59,218
<i>he may be in the fight.</i>

1956
01:56:00,319 --> 01:56:02,652
<i>Hard left hand by Creed.</i>

1957
01:56:02,654 --> 01:56:05,123
<i>Conlan was an overwhelmingly
heavy favorite</i>

1958
01:56:05,125 --> 01:56:08,860
<i>pounding young Creed with right
hands as you saw right there.</i>

1959
01:56:11,864 --> 01:56:13,563
Bring back everything that's ever hurt you.

1960
01:56:13,565 --> 01:56:16,801
All the pain you had inside,
everything that held you back.

1961
01:56:16,803 --> 01:56:21,004
Put it in both fists, and I want
you to drive it through his body

1962
01:56:21,006 --> 01:56:23,441
and I promise you, his head will fall.

1963
01:56:23,443 --> 01:56:25,008
<i>We're into the part of the fight</i>

1964
01:56:25,010 --> 01:56:27,244
<i>where all your instincts
come into play.</i>

1965
01:56:27,246 --> 01:56:29,379
<i>Most experts expected that Conlan</i>

1966
01:56:29,381 --> 01:56:31,414
<i>would avoid trading shots with Creed</i>

1967
01:56:31,416 --> 01:56:32,551
<i>but he's trading willingly.</i>

1968
01:56:33,653 --> 01:56:35,186
<i>Creed fires a hard body punch.</i>

1969
01:56:35,188 --> 01:56:37,088
<i>Conlan in trouble!</i>

1970
01:56:37,090 --> 01:56:39,624
- <i>Hard left hand to the body.</i>
- Oh, yeah!

1971
01:56:39,626 --> 01:56:41,426
<i>The champ is in bad shape, Jim.</i>

1972
01:56:41,428 --> 01:56:43,593
<i>Creed realized he
has a better chance</i>

1973
01:56:43,595 --> 01:56:46,765
<i>of hurting Conlan to the
body than to the head!</i>

1974
01:56:46,767 --> 01:56:48,900
- <i>What an uppercut!</i>
- No!

1975
01:56:48,902 --> 01:56:50,901
<i>And Creed staggers back.</i>

1976
01:56:50,903 --> 01:56:52,669
Body! Body!

1977
01:56:52,671 --> 01:56:54,638
<i>To the body, trading shots!</i>

1978
01:56:54,640 --> 01:56:55,839
<i>Pawing with his jab,</i>

1979
01:56:55,841 --> 01:56:57,174
<i>Creed looks to land one big shot.</i>

1980
01:56:57,176 --> 01:56:58,976
Move your legs!

1981
01:57:25,337 --> 01:57:27,607
Donnie, get up!

1982
01:57:28,675 --> 01:57:31,508
Get up, D!

1983
01:57:31,510 --> 01:57:33,678
Come on, baby.

1984
01:57:40,185 --> 01:57:42,354
Stitch!

1985
01:57:49,095 --> 01:57:50,695
<i>Creed just got up</i>

1986
01:57:50,697 --> 01:57:52,128
- <i>like a man possessed.</i>
- You okay? Look at me!

1987
01:57:52,130 --> 01:57:53,765
- <i>He was out!</i>
- Donnie!

1988
01:57:53,767 --> 01:57:56,167
<i>Down but not out. Conlan thinks
he's celebrating a knockout.</i>

1989
01:57:56,169 --> 01:57:57,602
Get down! He's getting up!

1990
01:57:57,604 --> 01:57:59,904
<i>But the referee is
dusting Creed's gloves.</i>

1991
01:57:59,906 --> 01:58:01,304
You're good.

1992
01:58:01,306 --> 01:58:04,575
<i>Creed beats the count and
the action begins again.</i>

1993
01:58:04,577 --> 01:58:06,210
<i>That's the heart of a champion.</i>

1994
01:58:06,212 --> 01:58:07,978
<i>He has his daddy's heart,
I'll tell you that much.</i>

1995
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:09,379
Donnie, be ready!

1996
01:58:09,381 --> 01:58:12,350
<i>More work to do for Conlan.
Body shot. Body shot.</i>

1997
01:58:12,352 --> 01:58:14,319
<i>Trying to set Creed
up one more time.</i>

1998
01:58:14,321 --> 01:58:17,223
Tie him up, for Christ's sake!

1999
01:58:19,125 --> 01:58:21,758
<i>Stitch has done a great
job over that right eye</i>

2000
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:24,294
<i>but now the left eye looks
like it's almost shut.</i>

2001
01:58:24,296 --> 01:58:26,062
<i>Closing up.</i>

2002
01:58:26,064 --> 01:58:27,597
- Rock, is he okay?
- You have to go back to...

2003
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:29,098
Stay there, Bianca, it's okay.

2004
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:31,436
I'm cool, man, I'm cool!

2005
01:58:31,438 --> 01:58:32,503
I'm good.

2006
01:58:32,505 --> 01:58:33,637
- You're good?
- Yeah, man, all right?

2007
01:58:33,639 --> 01:58:35,440
- You sure about that?
- I am. I'm good.

2008
01:58:35,442 --> 01:58:37,607
<i>He's taken a lot of punishment
to both the body and the head.</i>

2009
01:58:37,609 --> 01:58:39,209
<i>Left eye completely closed.</i>

2010
01:58:39,211 --> 01:58:40,643
- I'm gonna stop this thing.
- No!

2011
01:58:40,645 --> 01:58:42,446
Let me see the eye.

2012
01:58:42,448 --> 01:58:43,780
Time! Doc, give him a look!

2013
01:58:45,018 --> 01:58:46,918
All right. Show me your eye.

2014
01:58:46,920 --> 01:58:48,820
Show me your eye, Adonis!

2015
01:58:48,822 --> 01:58:50,655
How many fingers?

2016
01:58:50,657 --> 01:58:52,156
How many fingers?

2017
01:58:52,158 --> 01:58:53,624
How many, Adonis?

2018
01:58:53,626 --> 01:58:56,427
- Four.
- And again.

2019
01:58:56,429 --> 01:58:58,629
Two.

2020
01:58:58,631 --> 01:58:59,763
Time in!

2021
01:58:59,765 --> 01:59:01,365
All right. Breathe through your mouth.

2022
01:59:01,367 --> 01:59:03,368
Deep breaths, kid, deep.

2023
01:59:03,370 --> 01:59:04,935
You are up on the cards,
you're winning this.

2024
01:59:04,937 --> 01:59:06,137
You are gonna win this!

2025
01:59:06,139 --> 01:59:07,704
But just keep smart and keep away from him.

2026
01:59:07,706 --> 01:59:10,008
He's going to sleep this time.
He's going out this round.

2027
01:59:10,010 --> 01:59:11,609
I should've stopped the
fight with your father.

2028
01:59:11,611 --> 01:59:12,910
I'm stopping this one now.

2029
01:59:12,912 --> 01:59:15,312
Don't, okay? Let me finish.

2030
01:59:15,314 --> 01:59:18,149
- I gotta prove it.
- Prove what?

2031
01:59:18,151 --> 01:59:20,318
I'm not a mistake.

2032
01:59:23,590 --> 01:59:26,289
Look at me. I never got
a chance to thank Apollo

2033
01:59:26,291 --> 01:59:28,558
for helping me out after Mickey died.

2034
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:30,762
But it's nothing compared
to what you've done.

2035
01:59:30,764 --> 01:59:32,463
You taught me how to fight again

2036
01:59:32,465 --> 01:59:34,397
and I'm gonna go home and
I'm gonna fight this thing.

2037
01:59:34,399 --> 01:59:36,601
But if I fight, I want you to fight, too.

2038
01:59:36,603 --> 01:59:38,602
I want you to go across this ring

2039
01:59:38,604 --> 01:59:40,170
and knock that son of a bitch down.

2040
01:59:40,172 --> 01:59:42,039
Can you do it?

2041
01:59:42,041 --> 01:59:43,240
Say it.

2042
01:59:43,242 --> 01:59:44,807
I'm gonna knock that son of a bitch down.

2043
01:59:44,809 --> 01:59:46,243
I know you are. You know why?

2044
01:59:46,245 --> 01:59:48,145
Because you're a Creed and I love you, kid.

2045
01:59:48,147 --> 01:59:49,379
- I love you too.
- Go on.

2046
01:59:49,381 --> 01:59:51,817
All right, baby, let's go.

2047
01:59:54,254 --> 01:59:56,689
Go get him, Donnie!

2048
01:59:59,392 --> 02:00:01,292
<i>Round 12 begins.</i>

2049
02:00:01,294 --> 02:00:05,096
<i>Virtually no one outside of Adonis
Creed's family and group of friends</i>

2050
02:00:05,098 --> 02:00:06,864
<i>would ever have expected to see him</i>

2051
02:00:06,866 --> 02:00:09,933
<i>in a 12th round against
"Pretty" Ricky Conlan</i>

2052
02:00:09,935 --> 02:00:13,838
<i>and trading shots as they come
to these last three minutes.</i>

2053
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:16,441
<i>And there's a hard
left hook upstairs.</i>

2054
02:00:16,443 --> 02:00:17,909
Yeah!

2055
02:00:17,911 --> 02:00:20,276
<i>Every time you wanna say
it's the beginning of the end</i>

2056
02:00:20,278 --> 02:00:24,280
<i>the other guy comes through
with a shot you can't believe.</i>

2057
02:00:24,282 --> 02:00:25,816
<i>Hard right hand by Conlan.</i>

2058
02:00:25,818 --> 02:00:27,851
Come on! Don't sit there!

2059
02:00:27,853 --> 02:00:29,786
<i>They're trading shots</i>

2060
02:00:29,788 --> 02:00:31,655
<i>in the kind of back and forth action</i>

2061
02:00:31,657 --> 02:00:35,094
<i>that most of us
didn't expect to see.</i>

2062
02:00:36,328 --> 02:00:37,527
<i>Creed getting hit</i>

2063
02:00:37,529 --> 02:00:40,164
<i>with some hard shots but
landing some of his own,</i>

2064
02:00:40,166 --> 02:00:42,333
<i>and Adonis is firing back!</i>

2065
02:00:42,335 --> 02:00:44,334
<i>Another pitched battle
between the two warriors.</i>

2066
02:00:44,336 --> 02:00:46,170
- Ricky, nail him!
- Come on, kid!

2067
02:00:48,308 --> 02:00:50,874
<i>Creed spins, puts the
champ in the corner!</i>

2068
02:00:50,876 --> 02:00:52,343
Body! Body!

2069
02:00:52,345 --> 02:00:55,012
<i>Throwing body shots
like he's Rocky Balboa!</i>

2070
02:00:55,014 --> 02:00:57,615
<i>Going upstairs like
he's Apollo Creed!</i>

2071
02:00:57,617 --> 02:00:58,783
Knock his ass out!

2072
02:00:58,785 --> 02:01:01,185
<i>Closing seconds of the fight!</i>

2073
02:01:01,187 --> 02:01:03,686
Ricky!

2074
02:01:03,688 --> 02:01:05,222
That's what I'm talking about!

2075
02:01:05,224 --> 02:01:06,790
<i>Conlan is down!</i>

2076
02:01:06,792 --> 02:01:10,395
<i>That is the first time in his
career he's been on the canvas.</i>

2077
02:01:10,397 --> 02:01:14,731
<i>You cannot be saved by the bell
in the 12th and final round.</i>

2078
02:01:14,733 --> 02:01:16,566
- Ricky, get up!
- Stay down!

2079
02:01:16,568 --> 02:01:18,402
- Stay down!
- Six!

2080
02:01:18,404 --> 02:01:20,070
- <i>Dramatic count in Liverpool.</i>
- Seven! Eight!

2081
02:01:20,072 --> 02:01:22,373
<i>He must get up to preserve
his chance to win the fight.</i>

2082
02:01:22,375 --> 02:01:23,441
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

2083
02:01:23,443 --> 02:01:24,807
- Look at me!
- I'm all right!

2084
02:01:24,809 --> 02:01:25,976
- He's up!
- What?

2085
02:01:25,978 --> 02:01:27,177
<i>The bell sounds,</i>

2086
02:01:27,179 --> 02:01:29,512
<i>so Conlan survives the 12th round!</i>

2087
02:01:29,514 --> 02:01:31,082
<i>What a finish!</i>

2088
02:01:31,084 --> 02:01:34,651
<i>If that round goes another 30
seconds, we may have a new champion.</i>

2089
02:01:34,653 --> 02:01:37,987
<i>An unforgettable fight on
an unforgettable night!</i>

2090
02:01:37,989 --> 02:01:40,790
<i>He's no longer just the
namesake of Apollo Creed,</i>

2091
02:01:40,792 --> 02:01:42,593
<i>he's the living embodiment.</i>

2092
02:01:42,595 --> 02:01:43,927
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

2093
02:01:43,929 --> 02:01:48,833
<i>a round of applause for these
two warriors in the ring!</i>

2094
02:01:48,835 --> 02:01:53,271
<i>To the winner by split decision</i>

2095
02:01:53,273 --> 02:01:56,274
<i>and still the undefeated
champion of the world...</i>

2096
02:01:56,276 --> 02:01:57,841
You did great, kid.

2097
02:01:57,843 --> 02:01:59,575
<i>"Pretty" Ricky Conlan!</i>

2098
02:01:59,577 --> 02:02:00,710
Donnie, you were robbed.

2099
02:02:00,712 --> 02:02:03,714
If this fight had been 10 seconds longer...

2100
02:02:03,716 --> 02:02:05,115
10 seconds longer...

2101
02:02:05,117 --> 02:02:07,118
Creed.

2102
02:02:10,022 --> 02:02:11,388
You go and get it, chum.

2103
02:02:11,390 --> 02:02:13,022
You the future of this division.

2104
02:02:13,024 --> 02:02:14,859
You wear that name with pride.

2105
02:02:14,861 --> 02:02:16,793
Respect.

2106
02:02:16,795 --> 02:02:19,862
Congratulations, Adonis,
on a sensational effort.

2107
02:02:19,864 --> 02:02:22,900
I just wanna thank my mom.
She's at home. I love you.

2108
02:02:22,902 --> 02:02:24,468
Even though I know she's
mad at me for doing this.

2109
02:02:24,470 --> 02:02:26,203
<i>Hopefully I made her proud.</i>

2110
02:02:26,205 --> 02:02:28,905
You almost gave me a heart
attack but I'm proud of you.

2111
02:02:28,907 --> 02:02:30,106
I got my family right here.

2112
02:02:30,108 --> 02:02:33,444
Without them, none of this
would've been possible.

2113
02:02:33,446 --> 02:02:37,481
Rocky, Apollo Creed's son
looks at you and says family.

2114
02:02:37,483 --> 02:02:38,650
What does that mean to you?

2115
02:02:38,652 --> 02:02:42,084
It means I'm a lucky guy.
What can I say, right, kid?

2116
02:02:42,086 --> 02:02:46,255
He's a real fighter, and he's
helping me fight a few things,

2117
02:02:46,257 --> 02:02:48,659
so I appreciate it. I really do.

2118
02:02:48,661 --> 02:02:51,661
Adonis, I know you never met your father.

2119
02:02:51,663 --> 02:02:55,200
But if he was here tonight,
what would you wanna say to him?

2120
02:02:58,504 --> 02:03:01,438
I'll just tell him that I love him

2121
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:04,575
and I know he didn't leave me on purpose.

2122
02:03:04,577 --> 02:03:08,380
And I'm proud to be a Creed.

2123
02:03:09,616 --> 02:03:11,182
Thanks, Adonis, and congratulations

2124
02:03:11,184 --> 02:03:14,017
on a sensational performance. Jim.

2125
02:03:14,019 --> 02:03:18,257
Creed! Creed! Creed!

2126
02:03:21,627 --> 02:03:22,692
Go on.

2127
02:03:22,694 --> 02:03:25,963
Talk to them. Go on!

2128
02:03:47,153 --> 02:03:49,485
<i>This crowd is up on its feet.</i>

2129
02:03:49,487 --> 02:03:51,554
<i>No one wants to leave the arena.</i>

2130
02:03:51,556 --> 02:03:55,092
<i>Everyone in here knows they've
seen something special.</i>

2131
02:03:55,094 --> 02:03:56,892
<i>A fight they'll never forget.</i>

2132
02:03:56,894 --> 02:03:59,195
<i>Ricky Conlan wins the fight.</i>

2133
02:03:59,197 --> 02:04:02,734
<i>Adonis Creed wins the night.</i>

2134
02:04:21,821 --> 02:04:24,053
This is it?

2135
02:04:24,055 --> 02:04:26,090
Yeah.

2136
02:04:29,194 --> 02:04:31,594
I just wanna see if I
can get up these steps.

2137
02:04:31,596 --> 02:04:33,297
When's the first time you came here?

2138
02:04:33,299 --> 02:04:36,234
I was 12.

2139
02:04:36,236 --> 02:04:39,671
I think it's my favorite place.

2140
02:04:44,542 --> 02:04:47,677
When you get to the top

2141
02:04:47,679 --> 02:04:50,348
you think you can fly.

2142
02:05:08,067 --> 02:05:10,400
Almost there.

2143
02:05:10,402 --> 02:05:12,871
You got this.

2144
02:05:19,511 --> 02:05:20,578
Come on, young man.

2145
02:05:20,580 --> 02:05:21,811
Just let me catch my breath.

2146
02:05:21,813 --> 02:05:23,981
Come on, no breaks. We rest at the top.

2147
02:05:23,983 --> 02:05:25,915
Just a minute.

2148
02:05:25,917 --> 02:05:27,985
Nah, this is what you asked for, right?

2149
02:05:27,987 --> 02:05:31,289
Let's go. One step at a time.

2150
02:05:31,291 --> 02:05:33,824
Yeah.

2151
02:05:33,826 --> 02:05:36,994
Come on.

2152
02:05:36,996 --> 02:05:40,897
One step at a time. Who told you that?

2153
02:05:40,899 --> 02:05:42,132
Some old guy.

2154
02:05:42,134 --> 02:05:44,602
You know I meant that for you, not for me.

2155
02:05:47,773 --> 02:05:51,008
I think they added a few more steps.

2156
02:05:51,010 --> 02:05:52,209
I don't know.

2157
02:05:52,211 --> 02:05:53,377
Almost there.

2158
02:05:53,379 --> 02:05:55,279
I'm gonna take these last two.

2159
02:05:55,281 --> 02:05:57,080
One more step.

2160
02:05:57,082 --> 02:05:58,249
How you feeling?

2161
02:05:58,251 --> 02:06:01,553
Oh, good. Really good.

2162
02:06:06,625 --> 02:06:07,924
You all right there, old man?

2163
02:06:07,926 --> 02:06:10,127
Yeah.

2164
02:06:10,129 --> 02:06:12,631
Nice view.

2165
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:19,936
If you look hard enough, you can
see your whole life from up here.

2166
02:06:19,938 --> 02:06:21,637
How does it look?

2167
02:06:21,639 --> 02:06:25,107
Not bad at all. And you?

2168
02:06:25,109 --> 02:06:27,779
Not bad at all.

2169
