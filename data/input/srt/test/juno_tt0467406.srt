1
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,347
It started with a chair.

2
00:01:14,749 --> 00:01:16,549
I've wanted this
for a really long time.

3
00:01:18,449 --> 00:01:19,149
I know.

4
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:22,549
Wizard.

5
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,350
Jeez Banana,
shut your freakin' gob OK?

6
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,950
This is the most magnificent discarded
living room set I've ever seen.

7
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,161
Well, well, if it isn't
MacGuff the Crime Dog.

8
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:14,561
Back for another test?

9
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:17,861
I think the first one was defective,

10
00:04:18,361 --> 00:04:21,261
The plus sign looks more like a
division symbol, so I remain unconvinced.

11
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:27,661
Third test today, Momma Bear, your
eggo's preggo, no doubt about it.

12
00:04:28,662 --> 00:04:30,562
It's really easy to tell,
is your nipples real brown?

13
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:34,962
Yeah, maybe your little boyfriend's
got mutant sperms, knocked you up twice.

14
00:04:35,462 --> 00:04:40,362
Silencio, old man. Look, I just drank my
weight in SunnyD and I gotta go pronto.

15
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:42,962
Well, you know where the lavatory is.

16
00:04:45,463 --> 00:04:46,763
Pay for that pee stick when you're done.

17
00:04:47,963 --> 00:04:50,463
Don't think it's yours just 'cause
you marked it with your urine.

18
00:05:20,565 --> 00:05:23,065
What's the prognosis,
Fertile Myrtle: Minus or plus?

19
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:25,165
I don't know, it's not seasoned yet.

20
00:05:26,965 --> 00:05:27,765
I'll take some of these.

21
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,466
There it is.

22
00:05:35,866 --> 00:05:38,266
The little pink plus sign is so unholy.

23
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:44,066
That ain't no Etch-a-Sketch, this is one
doodle that can't be undid, homeskillet.

24
00:07:07,272 --> 00:07:08,272
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.

25
00:07:09,072 --> 00:07:09,872
I'm a suicide risk.

26
00:07:10,672 --> 00:07:11,172
Juno?

27
00:07:11,572 --> 00:07:14,072
No, it's Morgan Freeman, do you
have any bones that need collecting?

28
00:07:14,772 --> 00:07:17,373
Only the one in my pants.

29
00:07:19,073 --> 00:07:19,973
I'm pregnant.

30
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,973
What? Honest to blog?

31
00:07:22,373 --> 00:07:23,973
Yeah, it's Bleeker's.

32
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:27,573
It's probably just a food
baby, did you have a big lunch?

33
00:07:28,173 --> 00:07:33,374
This is not a food baby, I've taken three
pregnancy tests and I am fo' shiz up the spout.

34
00:07:35,474 --> 00:07:39,274
How did you even generate enough pee for
three pregnancy tests? That's amazing.

35
00:07:40,674 --> 00:07:43,174
I don't know, I drank
like ten tons of SunnyD.

36
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:47,675
I'm telling you I'm pregnant and
you're acting shockingly cavalier.

37
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,175
Is this for real?
Like for real for real?

38
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:52,275
Unfortunately yes.

39
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:55,875
Oh, my God!

40
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:58,875
Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!

41
00:07:59,575 --> 00:08:02,976
That was kind of the emotion that I
was searching for on the first take.

42
00:08:03,276 --> 00:08:05,441
Are you going to
Havenbrook or Women Now?

43
00:08:05,476 --> 00:08:08,176
You need a note from your
parents for Havenbrook.

44
00:08:08,576 --> 00:08:13,076
Yeah, I know. No, I'm going to go to Women
Now, just 'cause they help out women now.

45
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,776
Do you want me to call for you?
Because I called for Becky last year.

46
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:17,042
No, I can call myself.

47
00:08:17,077 --> 00:08:19,977
Oh, but I do need your help with
something, it's like critically important.

48
00:08:22,277 --> 00:08:23,977
You know, heavy lifting can
really only help you at this point.

49
00:08:25,877 --> 00:08:26,677
Seriously.

50
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:30,277
So, you were bored? That's how
this blessed miracle came to be?

51
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:34,878
No, the act was premeditated. I mean, the
sex, not the whole "let's get pregnant" thing.

52
00:08:35,878 --> 00:08:40,278
So, when did you decide that
you were gonna do Bleeker?

53
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:42,378
I don't know.

54
00:08:45,678 --> 00:08:46,678
A year ago in Spanish class.

55
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:49,979
You love him.

56
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,979
It's actually really complicated, OK?

57
00:08:56,579 --> 00:09:00,279
And I don't feel like talking
about it in my fragile state.

58
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:02,580
So what was it like?

59
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,680
Humping Bleek's bony bod?

60
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,080
Magnificent.

61
00:09:45,482 --> 00:09:46,182
Hey, Bleek.

62
00:09:48,783 --> 00:09:49,583
Wicked tiger.

63
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,383
It looks proud.

64
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:54,183
I swiped it from Ms. Rancick's lawn.

65
00:09:56,283 --> 00:09:58,883
Wow, your shorts are like
especially gold today.

66
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,083
My mom uses color-safe bleach.

67
00:10:01,883 --> 00:10:02,783
Go Carole.

68
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:05,084
I'll tell her.

69
00:10:09,584 --> 00:10:12,884
When I see them all running like that, with
their things bouncing around in their shorts,

70
00:10:13,284 --> 00:10:17,384
I always picture them naked, even if I
don't want to, all I see is pork swords.

71
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,285
I'm supposed to be running.

72
00:10:21,985 --> 00:10:22,585
So guess what.

73
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:25,185
What? I don't know.

74
00:10:27,485 --> 00:10:28,185
I'm pregnant.

75
00:10:40,186 --> 00:10:40,986
What should we do?

76
00:10:44,086 --> 00:10:49,787
Oh, you know, I was thinking I'd just
nip it in the bud before it gets worse.

77
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:52,887
Because they were talking
about it in health class,

78
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,187
how pregnancy can
often lead to an infant.

79
00:10:56,987 --> 00:10:57,787
Typically, yeah, yeah.

80
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,487
That's what happens when our
moms and teachers get pregnant.

81
00:11:05,188 --> 00:11:06,588
So, you're cool with that then?

82
00:11:07,788 --> 00:11:10,188
Yeah, yeah, wizard. You know,

83
00:11:11,288 --> 00:11:13,188
do whatever you think
you should do, you know?

84
00:11:18,788 --> 00:11:19,889
Well, I'm sorry I had sex with you,

85
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,789
I know it wasn't your idea.

86
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:26,089
Whose idea was it?

87
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:27,989
I'll see you at school, alright?

88
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:33,189
Whose idea was it?

89
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:01,691
Hey, your book fell apart.

90
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:03,491
Right.

91
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,192
It must have looked at your face.

92
00:12:08,392 --> 00:12:11,092
The funny thing is that Steve
Rendazo secretly wants me.

93
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:13,692
Jocks like him always want freaky girls.

94
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:18,492
Girls with horn-rimmed glasses
and vegan footwear and Goth makeup.

95
00:12:19,592 --> 00:12:22,393
Girls who play the cello
and read McSweeney's and

96
00:12:22,428 --> 00:12:25,193
want to be children's
librarians when they grow up.

97
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:28,193
Oh yeah, jocks totally eat that shit up.

98
00:12:28,893 --> 00:12:30,158
They just won't admit
it, because they're

99
00:12:30,193 --> 00:12:31,693
supposed to be into perfect
cheerleaders you know,

100
00:12:32,493 --> 00:12:35,594
Like Leah, who incidentally
is into teachers.

101
00:12:36,394 --> 00:12:38,094
Me too, I love Woody Allen!

102
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:43,894
Alright people.

103
00:12:44,294 --> 00:12:46,494
We're doing chromatography
lab today, so find

104
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:48,694
your partners and break
into groups of four.

105
00:12:54,895 --> 00:12:56,295
Well, there's nothing
like experimenting.

106
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,495
I did the prep questions
for this lab last night,

107
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,295
so you can just copy
my answers if you want.

108
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:03,495
I couldn't copy your work.

109
00:13:04,295 --> 00:13:05,495
You copy my work every week.

110
00:13:05,996 --> 00:13:07,996
True, I'm kind of a deadbeat
lab partner, aren't I?

111
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:10,296
No, no, I don't mind. I think you
definitely bring something to the table.

112
00:13:10,796 --> 00:13:11,496
Charisma.

113
00:13:13,896 --> 00:13:15,996
Who's ready for some chromamagnificence?

114
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:19,496
I have a menstrual migraine, so I can't
really look at bright lights today.

115
00:13:20,196 --> 00:13:23,397
Amanda, I told you to go to the
infirmary and lie down. You never listen.

116
00:13:23,897 --> 00:13:27,497
No, Josh, because I don't take orders.
Not from you and not from any man.

117
00:13:27,997 --> 00:13:29,447
You know, you've been
acting like this ever since

118
00:13:29,482 --> 00:13:30,897
I got back from visiting
my brother in Mankato.

119
00:13:31,497 --> 00:13:32,997
I already told you, nothing happened.

120
00:13:33,297 --> 00:13:34,897
Well, I'm gonna set up the apparatus.

121
00:13:36,298 --> 00:13:37,698
Juno, do you want to
plug in the Bunsen burner?

122
00:13:38,298 --> 00:13:39,098
It's my pleasure.

123
00:13:39,498 --> 00:13:40,098
I'm going to the infirmary.

124
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:41,398
Good. Call me when you get off the rag.

125
00:13:41,698 --> 00:13:43,298
Fine, call me when you
learn how to love someone,

126
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,898
instead of cheating at
your brother's college,

127
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:47,048
Just because you've had
four Smirnoff Ices and

128
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,898
a bottle of Snow Peak
Peach flavored Boone's!

129
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:51,699
Good, Amanda, I'll be sure to
do that, I'll make a note of it.

130
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:59,099
I've actually heard that the Snow Peak
Peach flavor is the best flavor of Boone's.

131
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:02,499
Isn't that right, Bleek?

132
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,200
Oprimo numero dos.

133
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:28,501
Yeah, I'm just calling to
procure a hasty abortion.

134
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:30,301
What?

135
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:34,501
Can you just hold on for a
second, I'm on my hamburger phone.

136
00:14:39,502 --> 00:14:41,002
Okay, now I can,

137
00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:43,502
Yeah, it's really awkward to talk on.

138
00:14:45,602 --> 00:14:48,002
Yeah, I need an abortion.

139
00:14:49,502 --> 00:14:50,502
Sixteen.

140
00:14:51,802 --> 00:14:56,503
I'm gonna say it's been about two
months and four days since the sex,

141
00:14:57,303 --> 00:14:59,303
Mind you, that's just
like a guestimation.

142
00:15:02,603 --> 00:15:04,003
Sorry, how long have I been what?

143
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,503
Oh, I hate it when adults use
the term "sexually active".

144
00:15:08,204 --> 00:15:09,304
What does it even mean?

145
00:15:09,704 --> 00:15:12,804
Can I deactivate someday, or is
this a permanent state of being?

146
00:15:13,404 --> 00:15:15,104
I guess Bleeker went
live that night we did it,

147
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:16,804
I guess that's why he
got that look on his face.

148
00:15:18,504 --> 00:15:21,369
You should have seen this
octopus furnace at work.

149
00:15:21,404 --> 00:15:24,705
I had to get out my Hazmat
suit just to get into the thing.

150
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:27,405
My dad used to be in the Army, but now
he's just your average HVAC specialist.

151
00:15:29,105 --> 00:15:31,305
He and my mom got
divorced when I was five,

152
00:15:31,705 --> 00:15:33,455
She lives on a Havasu
reservation in Arizona

153
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,205
with her new husband and
three replacement kids.

154
00:15:35,805 --> 00:15:38,806
Oh, and she inexplicably mails
me a cactus every Valentine's Day.

155
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:41,171
And I'm like, Thanks
a heap, Coyote Ugly.

156
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:44,006
This cactus-gram stings even
worse than your abandonment.

157
00:15:45,406 --> 00:15:48,806
That's my stepmom, Bren, she's
completely obsessed with dogs.

158
00:15:49,606 --> 00:15:52,906
Owns a nail salon and always
smells like methylmethacrylate.

159
00:15:53,807 --> 00:15:56,007
So Juno, how was your
little maneuver last night?

160
00:15:57,007 --> 00:16:00,407
Which maneuver, sir? The one where I moved an
entire living room set from one lawn to the other,

161
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:04,607
or the one where I downed a sixty-four
ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?

162
00:16:05,307 --> 00:16:07,807
Juno, did you by any
chance barf in my urn?

163
00:16:11,508 --> 00:16:14,008
Mac, you know that nice urn by the front
door, the one I got up in Stillwater?

164
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:16,108
There was some blue shit,

165
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,808
I mean, gunk, stuff
in there this morning.

166
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,308
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda.

167
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:26,609
I mean, maybe L.B. did it.

168
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:32,809
Liberty Bell, if you put one more Baco on that
potato, I'm gonna kick your little monkey butt.

169
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:40,110
All babies want to get borned!
All babies want to get borned!

170
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,810
All babies want to get borned!

171
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,710
Hey Su-Chin.

172
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,610
Hi, Juno.

173
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,210
How are you?

174
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,810
You know, pretty solid.

175
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,811
So did you write that
paper for Worth's class yet?

176
00:16:57,711 --> 00:16:58,611
No, not yet.

177
00:16:59,611 --> 00:17:02,811
I tried to work on it a little last night,
but I'm having trouble concentrating.

178
00:17:03,411 --> 00:17:04,911
I'll sell you some of my Adderall.

179
00:17:06,011 --> 00:17:07,311
No thanks, I'm off pills.

180
00:17:07,711 --> 00:17:10,912
That's a wise choice 'cause I knew
this girl, she had this crazy freakout.

181
00:17:11,812 --> 00:17:15,912
She took too many behavioral meds at
once and she ripped off her clothes

182
00:17:16,312 --> 00:17:22,312
and dove into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall
like, Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!

183
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:26,213
I heard that was you.

184
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:29,913
It was good seeing you, Su-Chin.

185
00:17:33,413 --> 00:17:35,513
Your baby probably has a
beating heart, you know?

186
00:17:36,413 --> 00:17:37,613
It can feel pain,

187
00:17:39,013 --> 00:17:40,214
And it has fingernails.

188
00:17:42,814 --> 00:17:44,514
Fingernails? Really?

189
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:04,215
Welcome to Women Now, where
women are trusted friends.

190
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:07,215
Please put your hands where I can
see them and surrender any bombs.

191
00:18:08,715 --> 00:18:10,115
Hey, I'm here for the big show.

192
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,216
Your name, please?

193
00:18:13,616 --> 00:18:14,516
Juno MacGuff.

194
00:18:15,816 --> 00:18:18,916
She thinks I'm using a fake name.
Like Gene Simmons or Mother Teresa.

195
00:18:22,216 --> 00:18:24,581
I need you to fill
these out, both sides.

196
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:27,517
We need to know about
every score and every sore.

197
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:31,917
Would you like a free condom?

198
00:18:32,717 --> 00:18:33,617
They're boysenberry.

199
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:35,717
No, I'm off sex.

200
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:40,217
My boyfriend uses them every
time we have intercourse.

201
00:18:41,018 --> 00:18:42,718
They make his jocks smell like pie.

202
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,220
All babies want to get borned!
All babies want to get borned!

203
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,620
God appreciates your miracle!

204
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,921
Dude, what are you doing here?

205
00:19:28,221 --> 00:19:29,521
I'm supposed to come get you at four.

206
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:30,721
I couldn't do it, Leah!

207
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:34,121
It smelled like a
dentist office in there,

208
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:36,221
And there were these horrible
magazines with water stains.

209
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:38,886
And then the friggin'
receptionist is trying to

210
00:19:38,921 --> 00:19:41,321
give me these condoms that
looked like grape suckers,

211
00:19:41,922 --> 00:19:45,222
and just babbling away about her
friggin' boyfriend's pie balls.

212
00:19:45,622 --> 00:19:46,322
Yum!

213
00:19:46,622 --> 00:19:48,487
And Su-Chin was there, and she was

214
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,822
like, "Oh hi! Babies have fingernails."

215
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:52,122
Fingernails!

216
00:19:52,622 --> 00:19:53,322
That's gruesome.

217
00:19:53,922 --> 00:19:56,022
You think the baby can scratch
your vag on the way out?

218
00:19:57,623 --> 00:19:58,923
I'm staying pregnant, Leah.

219
00:19:59,523 --> 00:20:02,423
Dude! You gotta keep your
voice down, my mom is inside.

220
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,723
She doesn't know that
we're sexually active.

221
00:20:05,123 --> 00:20:06,123
What does that even mean?

222
00:20:07,223 --> 00:20:08,823
I've been thinking.

223
00:20:09,723 --> 00:20:12,724
I was thinking that I could have this baby
and give it to someone who totally needs it.

224
00:20:13,024 --> 00:20:15,524
You know, like a woman with a bum
ovary or a couple of nice lesbos.

225
00:20:16,024 --> 00:20:19,124
But then you're gonna get huge
and your chest is gonna milktate.

226
00:20:20,124 --> 00:20:25,324
- And you have to tell people that you're pregnant.
- But maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.

227
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:31,425
Maybe they'll totally shit and be really mad and
not let you graduate or go to Cabo for spring break.

228
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:33,425
I was going to go to
Gettysburg with Bleeker anyway.

229
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,225
You should look at adoption ads,

230
00:20:38,525 --> 00:20:40,025
I see them all the
time in the Penny Saver.

231
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,726
They have ads for parents?

232
00:20:43,426 --> 00:20:48,926
Yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." Right next to
terriers and iguanas and used fitness equipment.

233
00:20:51,326 --> 00:20:51,626
It's totally legit.

234
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:59,627
"Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple
have found true love with each other."

235
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:02,627
"All that's missing is your bastard."

236
00:21:03,527 --> 00:21:04,527
I want a parakeet.

237
00:21:05,127 --> 00:21:06,627
You're totally not even listening to me.

238
00:21:06,927 --> 00:21:11,827
No, I heard you. I don't want to give the baby to
a family that describes themselves as "wholesome."

239
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:14,328
- Why?
- I want something a little more edgier.

240
00:21:14,728 --> 00:21:19,228
- Okay, what did you have in mind exactly?
- I was thinking a graphic designer,

241
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:24,228
mid-thirties, with a cool Asian girlfriend who
dresses awesome and rocks out on the bass guitar.

242
00:21:24,828 --> 00:21:26,328
But I don't want to be too particular.

243
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,629
OK, how about this?

244
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:34,029
"Educated, successful couple seeking
infant to join our family of five."

245
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:38,529
"You will be compensated. Help
us complete the circle of love."

246
00:21:39,129 --> 00:21:40,229
That sounds great.

247
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:45,330
They sound like a friggin' cult. Besides, they
already have three kids, they're greedy little bitches.

248
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,430
Oh, Juno! How about this one?

249
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,030
They were Mark and Vanessa Loring,

250
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,330
And they were beautiful
even in black and white.

251
00:22:07,131 --> 00:22:08,631
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?

252
00:22:09,031 --> 00:22:10,131
No, I don't think so.

253
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:12,431
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.

254
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:15,032
I'm not hungry, oddly.

255
00:22:15,632 --> 00:22:17,332
But it's breakfast for supper.
It's your favorite, Paul.

256
00:22:18,532 --> 00:22:19,432
Yeah.

257
00:22:20,932 --> 00:22:22,732
Juno MacGuff called while
you were out running today.

258
00:22:24,432 --> 00:22:25,732
You know how I feel about her.

259
00:22:26,932 --> 00:22:28,832
You've mentioned it a couple times.

260
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:31,433
She is just...

261
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:33,333
...different.

262
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:35,633
Yeah.

263
00:23:02,335 --> 00:23:04,435
I'm not really sure how
I'm gonna spit this out.

264
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:06,135
Hon, did you get expelled?

265
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:10,435
No. The school would most likely
contact you in the event of my expulsion.

266
00:23:11,035 --> 00:23:13,035
Well, I was just asking.
It seemed plausible.

267
00:23:13,635 --> 00:23:15,936
Do you need a large amount
of money? Legal counsel?

268
00:23:16,536 --> 00:23:18,336
No, I'm not asking for anything.

269
00:23:19,436 --> 00:23:23,036
Except for maybe mercy. Like, it would
be friggin' sweet if no one hit me.

270
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:25,336
What have you done, Junebug?
Did you hit someone with the Previa?

271
00:23:25,836 --> 00:23:26,536
No.

272
00:23:27,136 --> 00:23:29,636
Dude, I think it's
best to just tell them.

273
00:23:37,337 --> 00:23:38,237
I'm pregnant.

274
00:23:38,837 --> 00:23:39,637
Oh, God.

275
00:23:40,437 --> 00:23:42,137
But I'm going to give
it up for adoption.

276
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:43,737
I already found the perfect couple.

277
00:23:44,337 --> 00:23:46,238
They're gonna pay for the
medical expenses and everything.

278
00:23:47,738 --> 00:23:51,538
In thirty-odd weeks we can just
pretend that this never happened.

279
00:23:53,938 --> 00:23:54,838
You're pregnant?

280
00:23:55,338 --> 00:23:56,238
I'm sorry.

281
00:23:56,738 --> 00:24:00,238
I'm sorry. And if it is any consolation,

282
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,239
I have heartburn that's
radiating down to my kneecaps

283
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:05,839
and I haven't take a
dump since Wednesday.

284
00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:07,939
Morning!

285
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:09,739
I didn't even know you
were sexually active!

286
00:24:11,239 --> 00:24:12,039
Who is the kid?

287
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:16,540
The baby? I don't really know much
about it. It has fingernails, allegedly.

288
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,440
Nails? Really?

289
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,540
Yeah.

290
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,740
I mean, who is the father, Juno?

291
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,140
It's Paulie Bleeker.

292
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,340
Paulie Bleeker?

293
00:24:31,241 --> 00:24:31,841
What?

294
00:24:32,941 --> 00:24:34,141
I didn't think he had it in him!

295
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:35,541
I know, right?

296
00:24:36,841 --> 00:24:38,341
Right, this is no laughing matter.

297
00:24:38,741 --> 00:24:39,641
No, it's not.

298
00:24:40,241 --> 00:24:42,341
And Paulie is actually great.

299
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:44,141
In chair.

300
00:24:46,242 --> 00:24:47,342
You were thinking about adoption?

301
00:24:48,042 --> 00:24:50,107
Yeah, there's this couple.

302
00:24:50,142 --> 00:24:54,342
They've been trying to
have a kid for five years.

303
00:24:54,642 --> 00:24:56,742
We found them in the Penny
Saver next to the exotic birds.

304
00:24:57,642 --> 00:25:01,743
They have a legitimate lawyer and I was
going to go meet with them next weekend.

305
00:25:02,243 --> 00:25:04,708
Junebug, that is a
tough, tough thing to do.

306
00:25:04,743 --> 00:25:07,543
Probably tougher than you
can understand right now.

307
00:25:08,443 --> 00:25:10,143
I know...

308
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:14,243
...It's just that I'm
not ready to be a mom.

309
00:25:14,843 --> 00:25:15,843
Damn skippy, you're not!

310
00:25:16,744 --> 00:25:18,744
You don't even remember to give
Liberty Bell her breathing meds.

311
00:25:19,244 --> 00:25:22,444
That was once! And she
did not die, if you recall!

312
00:25:23,944 --> 00:25:27,344
Honey, had you considered,
you know, the alternative?

313
00:25:28,244 --> 00:25:29,144
No.

314
00:25:29,744 --> 00:25:31,544
Well, you're a little Viking!

315
00:25:33,945 --> 00:25:34,645
First things first,

316
00:25:35,145 --> 00:25:36,445
we have to get you healthy.

317
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:37,645
You need prenatal vitamins,

318
00:25:38,445 --> 00:25:41,845
Incidentally, they do incredible
things for your nails, so that's a plus.

319
00:25:42,345 --> 00:25:44,245
Oh, and we need to schedule
a doctor's appointment.

320
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,745
Figure out where
you're going to deliver.

321
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:48,946
Juno, I'm coming with you
to meet this adoption people.

322
00:25:50,246 --> 00:25:53,446
You're just a kid. I don't want you to get
ripped off by a couple of babystarved wingnuts.

323
00:25:54,446 --> 00:25:55,346
Thanks, Dad.

324
00:25:56,446 --> 00:25:58,546
I thought you were the kind of
girl who knew when to say when.

325
00:26:05,547 --> 00:26:07,147
I don't really know
what kind of girl I am.

326
00:26:21,148 --> 00:26:23,348
Tell it to me straight, Bren.
Do you think this is my fault?

327
00:26:24,148 --> 00:26:26,148
I think kids get bored
and have intercourse.

328
00:26:26,948 --> 00:26:29,548
And I think Junebug was
a dummy about it, Mac.

329
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:31,048
I am not ready to be a Pop-Pop.

330
00:26:31,648 --> 00:26:32,648
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop.

331
00:26:33,449 --> 00:26:38,249
Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing
from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation.

332
00:26:39,749 --> 00:26:41,849
Did you see that coming
when she sat us down here?

333
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:44,749
Yeah. But I was hoping she was
expelled or into hard drugs.

334
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:48,750
That was my first instinct too.
Or D.W.I. Anything but this.

335
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:53,450
And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid
in the weiner the next time I see him.

336
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,750
Mac, no. You know it wasn't his idea.

337
00:28:04,555 --> 00:28:07,755
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must
be Juno and Mr. MacGuff.

338
00:28:08,755 --> 00:28:09,655
Vanessa.

339
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,055
It's Vanessa, right?

340
00:28:12,155 --> 00:28:14,955
Thanks for having me and my
irresponsible child over to your house.

341
00:28:15,655 --> 00:28:16,555
Oh no. Thank you.

342
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:19,155
Come on in.

343
00:28:19,556 --> 00:28:21,856
Can I take your coat or your hat?

344
00:28:22,156 --> 00:28:23,256
Oh, yeah, sure, thanks.

345
00:28:24,056 --> 00:28:26,756
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver,
by the way. Super classy.

346
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:29,456
Not like those people with
fake woods in the background,

347
00:28:29,756 --> 00:28:31,656
Honestly, who do they
think they're fooling?

348
00:28:32,556 --> 00:28:33,656
You found us in the Penny Saver?

349
00:28:33,956 --> 00:28:35,857
Hi. Mark Loring. I'm the husband.

350
00:28:36,557 --> 00:28:38,357
- How you doing? Mac McGuff.
- Nice to meet you.

351
00:28:39,557 --> 00:28:40,257
Hi.

352
00:28:40,457 --> 00:28:42,357
This is Gerta Rauss, our attorney.

353
00:28:42,757 --> 00:28:44,657
Gerta Rauss.

354
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:46,757
Hi, pleased to meet you.

355
00:28:48,557 --> 00:28:50,058
And this, of course, is Juno.

356
00:28:51,358 --> 00:28:52,558
Like the city in Alaska.

357
00:28:52,958 --> 00:28:53,558
No.

358
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:54,958
No?

359
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:56,258
Hon?

360
00:28:56,758 --> 00:28:58,158
Shall we sit down and
get to know one another?

361
00:28:58,458 --> 00:28:59,658
I thought I'd get some drinks.

362
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:04,058
What would anyone like? I have Pellegrino
or Vitamin Water or orange juice.

363
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:06,559
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.

364
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:09,459
She's kidding.

365
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,559
Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor,
just one of her many genetic gifts.

366
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:14,659
I see.

367
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:21,260
So, Juno. First off,
how far along are you?

368
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,460
I'm a junior.

369
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,560
No, I mean in your pregnancy.

370
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:32,360
Oh. Uh, actually my stepmom took me yesterday
to the doctor and they said I was twelve weeks.

371
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,760
Oh, that's marvelous.

372
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,861
So you're into your second trimester?

373
00:29:37,261 --> 00:29:39,761
Yeah, apparently.

374
00:29:40,461 --> 00:29:41,861
I'm due on May 4.

375
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:42,861
Great.

376
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:45,361
My girlfriends tell me the first
couple months are the hardest.

377
00:29:45,961 --> 00:29:47,161
I didn't notice it at all.

378
00:29:47,461 --> 00:29:53,762
I'm more concerned about when they have to
put that elastic band in the front of my jeans.

379
00:29:54,862 --> 00:29:56,262
I think pregnancy is beautiful.

380
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:58,562
Well, you're lucky it's not you.

381
00:30:02,162 --> 00:30:04,862
So, let's talk how we're
gonna do this... thing.

382
00:30:05,362 --> 00:30:07,363
Well, don't I just have the thing?

383
00:30:07,663 --> 00:30:09,563
Squeeze it on out and hand it over?

384
00:30:10,563 --> 00:30:13,663
Mark and Vanessa are willing
to negotiate an open adoption.

385
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:15,163
What does that mean?

386
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:18,128
It means they'd send
annual updates, photos,

387
00:30:18,163 --> 00:30:21,664
let Juno know how the baby is
doing as he or she grows up.

388
00:30:21,964 --> 00:30:26,064
Whoah. I don't want photos
or any kind of notification.

389
00:30:27,464 --> 00:30:29,429
Can't we just kick this old school?

390
00:30:29,464 --> 00:30:32,464
I stick the baby in a
basket and send it your way.

391
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:33,964
Like Moses in the reeds.

392
00:30:35,064 --> 00:30:36,865
Technically, that would be
kickin' it Old Testament.

393
00:30:38,365 --> 00:30:39,865
Exactly! Right?

394
00:30:40,165 --> 00:30:40,965
Do you know what I mean?

395
00:30:41,265 --> 00:30:43,365
Like in the good old days.
When it was quick and dirty.

396
00:30:45,165 --> 00:30:50,365
Well, then we all agree a traditional closed
adoption would be best for all involved?

397
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:53,666
Shit, yes, just close her on up.

398
00:30:54,466 --> 00:30:56,866
Obviously, we would compensate
you for all your medical expenses.

399
00:30:57,866 --> 00:31:00,066
Are you looking for any
other type of compensation?

400
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:03,066
Excuse me?

401
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:07,567
No.

402
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:10,267
No, I don't want to
sell the thing, I just...

403
00:31:11,367 --> 00:31:12,267
...I want...

404
00:31:14,467 --> 00:31:18,267
...I just want the baby to be
with people who are gonna love it,

405
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:20,967
And be good parents, you know?

406
00:31:22,868 --> 00:31:24,468
I'm in high school.

407
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:28,068
I'm ill-equipped.

408
00:31:29,968 --> 00:31:33,368
You're doing a beautiful
and a selfless thing for us.

409
00:31:33,868 --> 00:31:36,068
Vanessa has wanted a baby
ever since we got married.

410
00:31:36,368 --> 00:31:37,569
I want to be a mommy so badly!

411
00:31:39,069 --> 00:31:39,969
You don't say.

412
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:42,669
Have you ever felt like you
were just born to do something?

413
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:44,269
Yes.

414
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:45,669
Heating and air conditioning.

415
00:31:46,369 --> 00:31:47,269
There you go.

416
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:49,469
I was born to be a mother.

417
00:31:50,069 --> 00:31:50,969
Some of us are.

418
00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:55,570
How about you, Mark, are you
looking forward to being a dad?

419
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:57,570
Betcha, yeah.

420
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:02,470
Every guy wants to be a father.
Wants to coach the soccer team and

421
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:06,470
help out with the science
fair and the volcano goes off.

422
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:08,671
Yeah, all that.

423
00:32:10,071 --> 00:32:14,071
Maybe Gerta could take us through the
preliminary documents that you have drawn up.

424
00:32:14,571 --> 00:32:20,671
Could I use the facilities first? Being
pregnant makes me pee like Seabiscuit.

425
00:32:21,471 --> 00:32:26,872
The downstairs bathroom is being re-tiled,
but if you go upstairs, then to the right...

426
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:28,572
Oh yeah! Room with the toilet.

427
00:32:30,072 --> 00:32:30,872
Is she alright?

428
00:33:18,775 --> 00:33:19,475
Sorry.

429
00:33:19,975 --> 00:33:20,975
Sorry, I didn't expect
to see you up here.

430
00:33:21,475 --> 00:33:22,475
I just came up to get something.

431
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:25,076
Did your wife send you
up here to spy on me?

432
00:33:25,676 --> 00:33:26,476
No.

433
00:33:26,976 --> 00:33:29,076
Do we come off as paranoid
yuppies or something?

434
00:33:32,576 --> 00:33:34,176
I stole a squirt of your wife's perfume.

435
00:33:34,776 --> 00:33:35,376
Really?

436
00:33:36,076 --> 00:33:37,376
It's Clinique Happy.

437
00:33:37,776 --> 00:33:39,577
Get a whiff of those sparkling topnotes!

438
00:33:40,177 --> 00:33:42,577
Is that supposed to make me feel happy?

439
00:33:43,377 --> 00:33:44,477
You should feel happy, Holmes.

440
00:33:45,277 --> 00:33:49,277
I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life.
Sweet, screaming, pooping life!

441
00:33:49,577 --> 00:33:51,577
And you don't even have to be there
when it comes out all covered in...

442
00:33:52,077 --> 00:33:52,877
Viscera?

443
00:33:53,177 --> 00:33:54,177
Blood and guts.

444
00:33:58,678 --> 00:33:59,778
Is that a Les Paul?

445
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:02,178
Yes, it is.

446
00:34:02,678 --> 00:34:04,378
Vanessa gave me my own
room for all my stuff.

447
00:34:05,778 --> 00:34:09,679
She gave you your own room in
your whole house for your stuff?

448
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:12,679
She's got you on a
long leash there, Mark.

449
00:34:14,279 --> 00:34:15,179
Oh, it's beautiful.

450
00:34:15,979 --> 00:34:18,479
You know? I always loved
Gibson way more than Fender.

451
00:34:19,779 --> 00:34:20,779
What do you play?

452
00:34:21,279 --> 00:34:22,579
I rock a Harmony.

453
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,780
So is it mahagony?

454
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,280
What happens if you crack the neck?

455
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,080
Tell me about it. I used
to play in this really tight

456
00:34:33,115 --> 00:34:34,580
band when I lived in Chicago
and one night we opened up

457
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,930
for the Melvins and I
busted that thing right on

458
00:34:36,965 --> 00:34:38,780
stage and it cost me
$800 just to get it fixed.

459
00:34:40,681 --> 00:34:42,181
When was that?

460
00:34:42,481 --> 00:34:44,181
‘93. Best time for rock and roll.

461
00:34:45,781 --> 00:34:50,081
Nuh-uh, '77! Punk Volume #1.

462
00:34:50,581 --> 00:34:51,481
You're crazy.

463
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:52,881
You weren't there,

464
00:34:53,081 --> 00:34:54,481
You couldn't understand the magic.

465
00:34:54,781 --> 00:34:55,982
You weren't even alive!

466
00:34:58,382 --> 00:34:59,082
What's that?

467
00:35:02,682 --> 00:35:03,682
It's a Pilates machine.

468
00:35:06,182 --> 00:35:07,182
What do you make with it?

469
00:35:08,582 --> 00:35:10,883
You don't make anything.
It's for exercising.

470
00:35:13,183 --> 00:35:14,283
My wife ordered one of those

471
00:35:15,283 --> 00:35:17,083
Tony Little Gazelles off the TV.

472
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:18,983
You know, from the
guy with the ponytail?

473
00:35:20,283 --> 00:35:21,683
That guy just doesn't look right to me.

474
00:35:30,784 --> 00:35:31,984
I'll be right back.

475
00:35:34,684 --> 00:35:35,484
Excuse me.

476
00:35:44,785 --> 00:35:45,385
Hi.

477
00:35:46,285 --> 00:35:46,785
Hi.

478
00:35:47,185 --> 00:35:48,185
You're playing music?

479
00:35:48,785 --> 00:35:50,485
Juno wanted a little
closer look at Kimber.

480
00:35:51,585 --> 00:35:52,685
Your guitar is named Kimber?

481
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:53,685
Yeah.

482
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,050
That's cool. My axe is named Roosevelt.

483
00:35:56,085 --> 00:35:59,186
After Franklin, not Ted. He
was the hot one with polio.

484
00:36:01,686 --> 00:36:03,886
Gerta is downstairs, we still have

485
00:36:04,586 --> 00:36:05,786
a lot of stuff to go over.

486
00:36:07,386 --> 00:36:08,286
I got it.

487
00:36:09,386 --> 00:36:10,886
Not to interrupt the jam session.

488
00:36:14,987 --> 00:36:18,287
So, just look these over and if you
have any questions, call me at my office.

489
00:36:18,887 --> 00:36:23,687
We would really appreciate it if you would just
keep us updated on any doctor's appointments,

490
00:36:23,987 --> 00:36:25,687
Ultrasounds, anything of that nature.

491
00:36:25,987 --> 00:36:29,888
For sure. You want to know how
your kid is cooking, I get it.

492
00:36:31,588 --> 00:36:32,688
You think you're really
going to do this, then?

493
00:36:34,288 --> 00:36:36,888
Yeah. I like you guys.

494
00:36:39,188 --> 00:36:40,688
How sure would you say you are?

495
00:36:43,489 --> 00:36:45,989
Would you say you're 80% sure, 90% sure?

496
00:36:48,489 --> 00:36:50,289
I'm going to say I'm about 104% sure.

497
00:36:50,989 --> 00:36:51,889
Really?

498
00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:57,390
Seriously, if I could just have the thing
and give it to you now, I totally would,

499
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:00,890
But I'm guessing it looks probably
like a Sea Monkey right now,

500
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:04,590
And we should let it get
a little cuter, right?

501
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:05,990
- Yeah.
- Great.

502
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,390
Keep it in the oven.

503
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,590
I think that's a great idea.

504
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:09,790
Nice to meet you both.

505
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:12,791
Please, drive carefully.
Hopefully we'll hear from you soon.

506
00:37:14,991 --> 00:37:17,091
- Take care.
- Buh bye.

507
00:37:51,893 --> 00:37:52,493
Hey, man.

508
00:37:52,893 --> 00:37:54,293
Hey, Vijay.

509
00:37:54,493 --> 00:37:55,993
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?

510
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:57,493
Yeah.

511
00:37:58,094 --> 00:38:00,094
- Like our moms and teachers!
- Yeah.

512
00:38:00,594 --> 00:38:01,394
Did you hear it's yours?

513
00:38:03,494 --> 00:38:04,294
Yup.

514
00:38:04,894 --> 00:38:06,294
What a trip, man.

515
00:38:06,594 --> 00:38:08,394
I don't really know too much about it.

516
00:38:09,294 --> 00:38:10,494
You should grow a moustache.

517
00:38:11,494 --> 00:38:12,294
I can't.

518
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:13,495
Me neither.

519
00:38:13,695 --> 00:38:15,195
But I'm going to stop
wearing underpants.

520
00:38:15,595 --> 00:38:17,695
Raise my sperm count.

521
00:38:44,297 --> 00:38:45,097
Juno, hey.

522
00:38:45,297 --> 00:38:45,997
Hey, Bleek.

523
00:38:46,197 --> 00:38:48,897
Me and some guys are gonna go to the movies
after school and we're gonna donut that flick

524
00:38:49,397 --> 00:38:51,597
with the guy who has eighteen kids.

525
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,097
Do you want to come?

526
00:38:54,797 --> 00:38:56,397
Sounds awesome, but I got my ultrasound.

527
00:38:57,297 --> 00:38:58,297
Oh, really?

528
00:38:59,798 --> 00:39:00,598
Can I...

529
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,298
...Should I come?

530
00:39:06,098 --> 00:39:07,398
Oh, you can't waste those donut balls,

531
00:39:07,798 --> 00:39:11,498
But maybe I could drop by later.

532
00:39:12,198 --> 00:39:13,398
Okay, cool.

533
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:15,299
- Later, Bleek.
- See ya.

534
00:39:17,999 --> 00:39:18,799
I'll save you a seat.

535
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,700
There's your baby.

536
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,700
Oh, my God.

537
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,100
There's a hand.

538
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,800
And an arm.

539
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,601
And there's the feet.

540
00:39:49,201 --> 00:39:50,101
Would you look at that?

541
00:39:52,101 --> 00:39:55,301
Check out Baby Big-Head. Dude,
that thing is freaky looking!

542
00:39:56,201 --> 00:39:58,701
Excuse me, I am a sacred vessel.

543
00:39:59,001 --> 00:40:00,902
All you've got in your
stomach is Taco Bell!

544
00:40:02,502 --> 00:40:04,802
It's amazing that there's
actually saps that cry at this.

545
00:40:06,202 --> 00:40:07,902
What? I'm not made of stone.

546
00:40:09,502 --> 00:40:10,602
Well, there you have it.

547
00:40:11,802 --> 00:40:12,702
Would you like to know the sex?

548
00:40:13,102 --> 00:40:13,902
- Yes.
- No.

549
00:40:14,202 --> 00:40:15,903
- Please, Junebug?
- No sex.

550
00:40:17,003 --> 00:40:18,503
Planning to be surprised
when you deliver?

551
00:40:18,903 --> 00:40:23,203
I want Mark and Vanessa to be surprised, and
if you told me, I'll just ruin everything.

552
00:40:23,703 --> 00:40:25,503
Are Mark and Vanessa
your friends at school?

553
00:40:25,903 --> 00:40:27,003
No, they're the adoptive parents.

554
00:40:28,603 --> 00:40:29,703
Oh. Well, thank goodness for that.

555
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:32,204
What's that supposed to mean?

556
00:40:33,604 --> 00:40:35,804
I just see a lot of teenage
mothers come through here.

557
00:40:36,704 --> 00:40:39,104
It's obviously a poisonous
environment to raise a baby in.

558
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:41,104
How do you know that I'm so poisonous?

559
00:40:41,504 --> 00:40:44,704
What if these adoptive parents
turn out to be evil molesters?

560
00:40:44,904 --> 00:40:46,905
Or like stage parents.

561
00:40:47,105 --> 00:40:49,505
They could be utterly negligent.
Maybe they'll do a far shittier job

562
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,805
of raising a kid than my
dumbass stepdaughter ever would.

563
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,605
Have you considered that?

564
00:40:54,005 --> 00:40:55,005
No, I guess not.

565
00:40:56,505 --> 00:40:57,705
What is your job title, exactly?

566
00:40:58,805 --> 00:41:01,606
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.

567
00:41:02,206 --> 00:41:05,606
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think
we both ought to stick to what we know.

568
00:41:06,106 --> 00:41:06,906
Excuse me?

569
00:41:07,706 --> 00:41:12,106
You think you're so special because
you get to play Picture Pages up there?

570
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:14,406
My five year-old daughter could do that, and let me tell
you, she is not the brightest bulb in the tanning bed.

571
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,707
So why don't you go back to night
school in Manteno and learn a real trade!

572
00:41:23,707 --> 00:41:25,107
Bren, you's a dick!

573
00:41:26,707 --> 00:41:27,607
I love it.

574
00:42:31,211 --> 00:42:32,812
Juno? Wow, I didn't
expect to see you here.

575
00:42:33,412 --> 00:42:36,212
I have something really cool to
show you guys. Is Vanessa here?

576
00:42:37,612 --> 00:42:39,712
No, actually she's working late tonight.

577
00:42:40,612 --> 00:42:42,612
She's trying to accrue as much
time off as she can before...

578
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:44,712
Oh right. I hear these
are quite the time-suck.

579
00:42:46,212 --> 00:42:48,213
Wanna come in? I was just
having a Ginseng Cooler.

580
00:42:48,713 --> 00:42:49,813
Would you like one?

581
00:42:50,113 --> 00:42:53,113
What is it with you rich people
and your herb-infused juices?

582
00:42:54,813 --> 00:42:56,213
It's probably got something to do with
those forty four-packs they come in.

583
00:42:57,813 --> 00:42:59,013
They're not bad, though.

584
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:01,213
Why aren't you at work?

585
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:03,814
I work mostly from home. I'm a composer.

586
00:43:05,514 --> 00:43:06,414
No shit.

587
00:43:07,114 --> 00:43:08,414
Like Johannes Brahms?

588
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:10,514
No, more commercial stuff.

589
00:43:11,314 --> 00:43:12,114
Like what?

590
00:43:12,514 --> 00:43:13,614
Commercials.

591
00:43:15,014 --> 00:43:17,214
Have you seen the ads for the
Titanium Power men's deodorant?

592
00:43:28,715 --> 00:43:29,715
Paid for this kitchen.

593
00:43:32,515 --> 00:43:33,516
You're quite the sellout, Mark.

594
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:36,916
What would the Melvins say?

595
00:43:38,516 --> 00:43:39,816
Did you say you had
something to show me.

596
00:43:40,716 --> 00:43:43,316
Behold, good sir! Your future child.

597
00:43:45,316 --> 00:43:46,216
Hey, look at that.

598
00:43:50,117 --> 00:43:51,817
I think it looks like my friend Paulie.

599
00:43:53,817 --> 00:43:55,217
Is he also bald and amorphous?

600
00:43:55,617 --> 00:43:56,617
No, he's the dad.

601
00:44:00,117 --> 00:44:01,117
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?

602
00:44:02,617 --> 00:44:06,018
I can't, the doctor can. But I
kind of want it to be a surprise.

603
00:44:07,518 --> 00:44:09,618
Well, it can only go one of two ways.

604
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:11,283
That's what you think.

605
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:16,318
I drink tons of booze so you might end up with one
of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.

606
00:44:17,118 --> 00:44:17,918
Junk, huh?

607
00:44:19,019 --> 00:44:20,019
You know, it's parts.

608
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:21,319
I know what junk is.

609
00:44:21,819 --> 00:44:22,319
Yeah, right.

610
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:23,619
We definitely want it to
have some junk, please.

611
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:25,719
Well, you don't need
to worry about a thing.

612
00:44:26,419 --> 00:44:29,719
My stepmom, Bren, makes
me eat super healthy.

613
00:44:30,419 --> 00:44:32,619
I can't stand in front of
the microwave and no red M&Ms.

614
00:44:33,419 --> 00:44:35,420
I hope you're ready.

615
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,920
Ooh... do you hear that?

616
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:40,820
What?

617
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:45,220
This is my favorite song. It's Sonic
Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.

618
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,320
Oh, yeah, yeah, I know the Carpenters.

619
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,021
Chick drummer, freaky dude.
Not unlike the White Stripes.

620
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:53,721
You haven't heard the Carpenters
like this. Just listen.

621
00:45:02,821 --> 00:45:05,322
Yeah, I like this.

622
00:45:06,522 --> 00:45:07,722
What did you say your favorite band was?

623
00:45:08,022 --> 00:45:13,322
Didn't. It's a three-way tie between the
Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.

624
00:45:13,522 --> 00:45:16,122
I definitely need to make you some
CDs. At least while my kid's in there.

625
00:45:21,823 --> 00:45:22,823
The Wizard of Gore?

626
00:45:23,523 --> 00:45:26,123
That is Herschel Gordon Lewis.
He's the ultimate master of horror.

627
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:31,123
Please. Dario Argento is so
the ultimate master of horror.

628
00:45:32,423 --> 00:45:33,423
Argento?

629
00:45:33,923 --> 00:45:37,024
He's alright, but Lewis
is completely dimented.

630
00:45:37,624 --> 00:45:39,389
We're talking buckets of goo.

631
00:45:39,424 --> 00:45:44,024
Red corn syrup all over the place.
Fake brains coming out the yin-yang.

632
00:45:44,724 --> 00:45:47,124
Quite frankly, this
looks a little stupid.

633
00:45:49,324 --> 00:45:50,025
Give me the tape.

634
00:46:05,025 --> 00:46:07,126
This is even better than Suspiria.

635
00:46:07,726 --> 00:46:08,426
What'd I tell ya?

636
00:46:08,726 --> 00:46:12,326
You have decent taste in slasher movies.

637
00:46:13,226 --> 00:46:14,526
Here's to dovetailing interests.

638
00:46:18,426 --> 00:46:19,826
Have you guys thought of
any names for the baby yet?

639
00:46:21,827 --> 00:46:25,027
Sort of, yes. Vanessa
likes Madison for a girl.

640
00:46:28,727 --> 00:46:30,427
Madison?

641
00:46:32,327 --> 00:46:35,427
Isn't that a little, gay?

642
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:41,328
Well, pretentious much? Should everyone
just have a mysterious name like Juno?

643
00:46:44,428 --> 00:46:48,228
My dad went through this huge obsession
with Roman and Greek mythology.

644
00:46:48,628 --> 00:46:51,629
He decided to name me after Zeus's wife,

645
00:46:52,229 --> 00:46:56,729
Zeus had tons of lays, but I'm
pretty sure Juno was his only wife.

646
00:46:58,229 --> 00:47:01,929
She was supposed to be really beautiful
but really mean. Like Diana Ross.

647
00:47:03,729 --> 00:47:04,729
That suits you.

648
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:07,630
Thanks?

649
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:12,330
You're something else.

650
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,630
Vanessa. You'd better go.

651
00:47:21,831 --> 00:47:24,031
She hates when I sit around watching
movies and I don't contribute.

652
00:47:25,831 --> 00:47:29,131
I'll handle this. I'm really
good at diffusing mom-type rage.

653
00:47:29,431 --> 00:47:30,131
No, Juno, no.

654
00:47:33,031 --> 00:47:34,331
Juno, what's going on?

655
00:47:34,731 --> 00:47:36,031
- Nothing.
- What are you doing here? What's wrong?

656
00:47:36,231 --> 00:47:37,432
Nothing, I went to the doctor today.

657
00:47:37,732 --> 00:47:38,632
Is there something wrong with the baby?

658
00:47:38,932 --> 00:47:39,497
The baby is great.

659
00:47:39,532 --> 00:47:41,832
It's the right size and everything.
I even saw its phalanges today!

660
00:47:42,532 --> 00:47:43,732
Here.

661
00:47:45,432 --> 00:47:46,032
It's the baby.

662
00:47:47,132 --> 00:47:47,732
It's your baby.

663
00:47:52,033 --> 00:47:54,433
It kinda looks like it's waving.

664
00:47:55,733 --> 00:47:58,733
Like it's saying "Hey,
Vanessa. Will you be my mom?"

665
00:47:59,733 --> 00:48:01,033
Yeah, it kind of does.

666
00:48:02,033 --> 00:48:04,233
Juno was nice enough to
bring that over for us today.

667
00:48:04,433 --> 00:48:06,233
I came as soon as I got that
ultrasound goo off my pelvis.

668
00:48:07,734 --> 00:48:09,834
It was crazy actually,

669
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:14,634
My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound
tech so we got escorted off the premises.

670
00:48:20,134 --> 00:48:21,734
Wow, what kind of swag did you score?

671
00:48:22,835 --> 00:48:23,735
Mall madness, huh?

672
00:48:23,935 --> 00:48:25,535
It's just some stuff I
picked up for the baby.

673
00:48:26,535 --> 00:48:28,735
Don't you usually get all
that stuff at a baby shower?

674
00:48:29,335 --> 00:48:32,835
When my stepmom was pregnant with my
little sister she got a million gifts.

675
00:48:33,635 --> 00:48:35,735
But I wasn't jealous 'cause
they all were super lame.

676
00:48:36,435 --> 00:48:37,736
I doubt anyone's gonna
throw us a shower.

677
00:48:38,536 --> 00:48:39,936
Why wouldn't they
throw you a baby shower?

678
00:48:40,336 --> 00:48:45,836
I don't think people know how to feel about
this situation because it's not set in stone.

679
00:48:47,236 --> 00:48:48,036
What isn't set...

680
00:48:50,736 --> 00:48:52,937
You don't think I'm
going to flake out on you?

681
00:48:53,537 --> 00:48:54,437
No, I don't, Juno.

682
00:48:55,837 --> 00:48:57,437
We went through a situation before

683
00:48:58,237 --> 00:48:59,137
where it didn't work out.

684
00:48:59,337 --> 00:49:00,437
Cold feet.

685
00:49:06,037 --> 00:49:07,037
You should have gone to China.

686
00:49:08,838 --> 00:49:11,238
I hear they give away
babies like free iPods.

687
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:14,238
They put ‘em in those T-shirt guns

688
00:49:15,338 --> 00:49:16,438
and shoot them out at sporting events.

689
00:49:19,438 --> 00:49:21,838
Your parents are probably
wondering where you are.

690
00:49:22,138 --> 00:49:23,839
Naah. I'm already pregnant,

691
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:26,439
so what other kind of
shenanigans could I get into?

692
00:49:27,939 --> 00:49:29,339
I should probably bounce.

693
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:30,839
Hey, don't forget your bag.

694
00:49:31,439 --> 00:49:32,339
Ah, bag!

695
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:38,840
Okay, take care.

696
00:50:01,741 --> 00:50:02,641
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?

697
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:06,841
I just drove to St. Cloud to show
Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound.

698
00:50:06,876 --> 00:50:08,541
I ended up staying
for a couple of hours.

699
00:50:09,242 --> 00:50:11,642
A couple of hours? Why are you
going over there in the first place?

700
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:17,042
They wanted to know about this stuff.
I said I'd keep them updated, so I did!

701
00:50:17,442 --> 00:50:19,042
You could have mailed it to them.

702
00:50:19,342 --> 00:50:21,942
Why would you drive an hour
out to East Jesus, Nowhere?

703
00:50:24,042 --> 00:50:26,243
I don't know, I just did.

704
00:50:26,743 --> 00:50:28,543
And while Mark and I
were waiting for Vanessa,

705
00:50:28,578 --> 00:50:29,743
we watched The Wizard of Gore,

706
00:50:31,343 --> 00:50:34,043
And he burned me a couple
of CDs of this weird music.

707
00:50:35,043 --> 00:50:36,043
He's kind of cool.

708
00:50:38,543 --> 00:50:41,844
Juno, you can't just
drop in on them like that.

709
00:50:42,944 --> 00:50:46,644
No, it was not a big deal.
He was totally cool with it.

710
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:47,944
You don't understand.

711
00:50:48,244 --> 00:50:50,244
Mark is a married man,
there are boundaries.

712
00:50:51,344 --> 00:50:52,344
Oh, come on.

713
00:50:52,644 --> 00:50:53,544
Listen,

714
00:50:53,844 --> 00:50:54,845
Bren-duhhh.

715
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:58,995
You're acting like you're the
one who has to go through this

716
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:02,145
and get huge and shove a baby
out of your vag for someone else.

717
00:51:03,945 --> 00:51:05,445
What does it even
matter if he's married?

718
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,845
I can have friends that are married.

719
00:51:07,245 --> 00:51:08,510
It doesn't work that way, kiddo.

720
00:51:08,545 --> 00:51:10,846
You don't know squat about
the dynamics of marriage.

721
00:51:11,146 --> 00:51:12,246
You don't know anything about me!

722
00:51:12,646 --> 00:51:13,446
I know enough.

723
00:51:16,446 --> 00:51:17,346
We don't even have a dog!

724
00:51:17,846 --> 00:51:20,446
Yeah, because you're
allergic to their saliva.

725
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:25,247
I have sacrificed a lot for you, Juno.
But in a couple years when you move out

726
00:51:25,847 --> 00:51:27,347
I'm going to get Weimaraners.

727
00:51:28,047 --> 00:51:28,947
Wow, dream big!

728
00:51:29,247 --> 00:51:30,647
Oh, go fly a kite.

729
00:51:55,649 --> 00:51:56,249
Hi, Juno.

730
00:51:57,249 --> 00:51:58,049
What can I do for you?

731
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:00,949
Bleeker home?

732
00:52:01,549 --> 00:52:03,649
Bleeker's mom was
possibly attractive once.

733
00:52:04,149 --> 00:52:05,349
But now she looks a hobbit.

734
00:52:07,949 --> 00:52:09,349
You know, the fat one
that was in The Goonies.

735
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:18,250
Hey, man,

736
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:20,950
Don't concentrate so hard.
I think I can smell your hair all burning.

737
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:23,050
Hey, what's up?

738
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:26,316
Not much, I just wanted to come say hey.

739
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:30,051
I miss hanging out with
you on school nights.

740
00:52:32,251 --> 00:52:34,651
Orange Tic-Tacs are
Bleeker's one and only vice.

741
00:52:35,751 --> 00:52:39,051
The day I got pregnant, his mouth
tasted really tangy and delicious.

742
00:52:49,252 --> 00:52:50,452
You seem to be getting...

743
00:52:51,052 --> 00:52:52,252
...pregnant-er these days.

744
00:52:55,552 --> 00:52:57,953
Ya know, I set up this
whole private adoption...

745
00:52:58,553 --> 00:53:03,253
...and this married couple in Saint
Cloud are going to be the parents.

746
00:53:03,953 --> 00:53:04,453
Really?

747
00:53:05,653 --> 00:53:06,853
What are they like?

748
00:53:07,253 --> 00:53:09,853
The guy, he's awesome.

749
00:53:10,753 --> 00:53:11,854
His name is Mark and

750
00:53:12,654 --> 00:53:15,154
he likes old horror movies
and he plays the guitar.

751
00:53:15,954 --> 00:53:17,254
We actually hung out this afternoon.

752
00:53:18,154 --> 00:53:19,154
Is that normal?

753
00:53:20,054 --> 00:53:21,254
Probably not, but...

754
00:53:22,154 --> 00:53:26,154
I talked to dad and Bren and they said
they wouldn't narc you out to your folks,

755
00:53:27,255 --> 00:53:28,155
So,

756
00:53:28,855 --> 00:53:30,355
I think we should be cool.

757
00:53:31,255 --> 00:53:32,255
That's a relief.

758
00:53:38,555 --> 00:53:40,055
I'm gonna start looking

759
00:53:40,555 --> 00:53:41,755
like a pretty big dork soon.

760
00:53:43,456 --> 00:53:45,956
Will you still think
I'm cute when I'm huge?

761
00:53:47,256 --> 00:53:48,756
I always think you're cute.

762
00:53:49,756 --> 00:53:50,756
I think you're beautiful.

763
00:53:51,556 --> 00:53:52,356
Jeez, Bleek.

764
00:53:53,656 --> 00:53:54,656
I do.

765
00:53:58,157 --> 00:54:01,357
Hey Junebug, when this is all over
we should get the band back together.

766
00:54:02,157 --> 00:54:03,657
Yeah.

767
00:54:04,757 --> 00:54:05,757
That would be awesome.

768
00:54:06,157 --> 00:54:07,957
Once Tino gets a new drumhead

769
00:54:08,257 --> 00:54:10,157
we're just, like, ready to rock.

770
00:54:11,657 --> 00:54:13,858
We could always get back together too.

771
00:54:14,758 --> 00:54:15,758
That's an option.

772
00:54:20,358 --> 00:54:21,958
Were we together?

773
00:54:22,658 --> 00:54:23,758
Yeah, we were once.

774
00:54:25,958 --> 00:54:27,058
That time.

775
00:54:33,859 --> 00:54:34,859
What about Katrina De Voort?

776
00:54:35,659 --> 00:54:37,559
You could totally go out
with Katrina De Voort.

777
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,759
I don't like Katrina.

778
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:41,459
She smells like soup.

779
00:54:41,959 --> 00:54:43,160
Her whole house smells of soup.

780
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,560
Okay.

781
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:58,361
So we have Custard, Cheesecake.

782
00:54:59,461 --> 00:55:00,461
They're yellow.

783
00:55:02,461 --> 00:55:04,611
I wanted to pick something
that was gender-neutral until

784
00:55:04,646 --> 00:55:06,761
we get the baby and then we
can add a more decisive palette.

785
00:55:08,661 --> 00:55:11,861
Why does everyone think
yellow is gender-neutral?

786
00:55:12,161 --> 00:55:13,261
I don't know any guy
with a yellow bedroom.

787
00:55:16,262 --> 00:55:18,462
I'm thinking more
Custard with this light.

788
00:55:20,062 --> 00:55:22,662
I don't know. Maybe I should
paint a larger swatch...

789
00:55:26,962 --> 00:55:28,162
Or you could wait a few more months.

790
00:55:29,463 --> 00:55:32,663
It's not like the baby's going to storm
in here demanding dessert-colored walls.

791
00:55:38,063 --> 00:55:43,964
"What to Expect" says that readying the baby's
room is an important process for the woman.

792
00:55:44,464 --> 00:55:46,564
Especially if you're adopting.
It's called "nesting."

793
00:55:47,864 --> 00:55:48,864
Nesting?

794
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,864
Are you going to build the
crib out of sticks and spit?

795
00:55:56,064 --> 00:56:00,365
You should read the book. I flagged
the "daddy chapters" for you.

796
00:56:00,665 --> 00:56:02,065
I think it's too early to paint.

797
00:56:02,465 --> 00:56:03,565
That's my opinion.

798
00:56:04,965 --> 00:56:05,965
I disagree.

799
00:56:10,165 --> 00:56:11,565
This wall is going to need something.

800
00:56:15,366 --> 00:56:17,066
Our first family photo
right in the middle.

801
00:56:18,266 --> 00:56:19,266
Right up there.

802
00:56:22,866 --> 00:56:23,866
Can you see it?

803
00:56:28,066 --> 00:56:30,367
Yum! This pretzel tastes
like a friggin' donut!

804
00:56:30,867 --> 00:56:31,867
Share the love, sweetness!

805
00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:33,067
You can't have any.

806
00:56:35,067 --> 00:56:36,067
She's assaulting me!

807
00:56:37,067 --> 00:56:38,267
She's denying me fresh-baked goodness!

808
00:56:39,367 --> 00:56:40,267
Oh, my God.

809
00:56:42,167 --> 00:56:43,467
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.

810
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:46,268
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?

811
00:56:50,068 --> 00:56:51,768
Dude, she's, like, really pretty.

812
00:56:52,068 --> 00:56:53,868
You sound totally shocked or something.

813
00:56:55,768 --> 00:56:58,168
She's totally gonna steal
that kid for her collection.

814
00:56:58,668 --> 00:56:59,768
Right, seriously.

815
00:57:09,469 --> 00:57:10,569
Boring!

816
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:25,370
I could so go for a huge cookie right now with like,
a lamb kebab, simultaneously.

817
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:28,970
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?

818
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:32,471
It's like, never-ending for you.

819
00:57:33,771 --> 00:57:34,671
Juno!

820
00:57:34,971 --> 00:57:35,771
Hi, Vanessa!

821
00:57:36,171 --> 00:57:38,171
What brings you to the mall today?

822
00:57:38,671 --> 00:57:40,871
I was just shopping with my girlfriends.

823
00:57:41,571 --> 00:57:42,771
You're gay?

824
00:57:43,071 --> 00:57:43,771
No.

825
00:57:44,071 --> 00:57:45,371
Just ignore her.

826
00:57:45,772 --> 00:57:47,072
Well, how are you feeling?

827
00:57:47,272 --> 00:57:49,172
Great! Everything's stupendous.

828
00:57:49,472 --> 00:57:52,372
Oh, coming in on that snooze button.

829
00:57:54,872 --> 00:57:55,772
That's incredible.

830
00:57:56,972 --> 00:57:57,972
Oh, God.

831
00:57:59,272 --> 00:58:00,072
What?

832
00:58:00,272 --> 00:58:01,673
Kicking away.

833
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:06,773
Could I feel it?

834
00:58:07,873 --> 00:58:08,973
Are you kidding?

835
00:58:11,273 --> 00:58:14,573
At school everyone's just
grabbing my belly all the time.

836
00:58:15,073 --> 00:58:17,274
I'm a legend.
They call me the Cautionary Whale.

837
00:58:21,874 --> 00:58:22,974
I can't feel anything.

838
00:58:26,374 --> 00:58:27,374
It's not moving for me.

839
00:58:29,974 --> 00:58:31,239
You should try talking to it.

840
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:34,975
They can hear you, even though it's
all ten thousand leagues under the sea.

841
00:58:50,576 --> 00:58:51,576
Hi, baby.

842
00:58:56,876 --> 00:58:58,976
It's me. It's Vanessa.

843
00:59:03,977 --> 00:59:05,877
I can't wait to meet you.

844
00:59:13,277 --> 00:59:15,177
Can you hear me, baby?

845
00:59:16,677 --> 00:59:17,878
Sweet angel?

846
00:59:28,878 --> 00:59:30,378
I felt it!

847
00:59:32,779 --> 00:59:33,879
That was magical.

848
00:59:39,379 --> 00:59:40,379
Thank you.

849
00:59:40,879 --> 00:59:41,879
Thank you.

850
01:00:34,383 --> 01:00:35,083
Hello?

851
01:00:35,583 --> 01:00:36,383
Hey!

852
01:00:36,583 --> 01:00:40,383
So, I've been listening to that
really weird CD that you made me.

853
01:00:40,783 --> 01:00:41,783
Yeah? What's the verdict?

854
01:00:42,283 --> 01:00:43,483
Well, it's cute.

855
01:00:44,083 --> 01:00:45,183
It's cute?

856
01:00:45,483 --> 01:00:48,283
When you're used to listening to the
raw power of Iggy and the Stooges,

857
01:00:48,784 --> 01:00:51,684
everything else just sounds
kind of precious in comparison.

858
01:00:52,684 --> 01:00:55,384
I imagine you have a collection of
punk chestnuts to prove your point.

859
01:00:56,184 --> 01:00:56,984
Well...

860
01:00:57,584 --> 01:00:59,084
...consider it your musical education.

861
01:01:00,184 --> 01:01:01,484
I can't wait to see what
you've got to teach me.

862
01:01:02,384 --> 01:01:04,185
Stop surfing porn and get back to work.

863
01:01:05,585 --> 01:01:07,185
Just wanted to call and say hi.

864
01:01:08,185 --> 01:01:09,585
Go learn something.

865
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:15,685
- Oh, a little trip down Mexico way.
- And Greece and China apparently.

866
01:01:16,685 --> 01:01:17,885
How many months has it been now?

867
01:01:18,285 --> 01:01:19,286
You're getting huge.

868
01:01:19,886 --> 01:01:22,986
It's homing in on the eight. You
should see how weird I look naked.

869
01:01:23,986 --> 01:01:25,486
I wish my funbags would get bigger.

870
01:01:26,086 --> 01:01:28,786
Trust me, you don't. I have to
actually wear a friggin' bra now

871
01:01:29,286 --> 01:01:34,887
and rub all this nasty cocoa butter
stuff on myself so my skin won't explode.

872
01:01:35,387 --> 01:01:36,187
Hot!

873
01:01:39,287 --> 01:01:40,787
Why is everyone always staring at me?

874
01:01:41,487 --> 01:01:43,087
Well, you are kind of convex, you know?

875
01:01:44,987 --> 01:01:47,987
Whoah! Who's been doing their
geometry homework for once!

876
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:51,488
I have no choice. Keith has
been grading me so hard lately.

877
01:01:51,888 --> 01:01:54,088
Do not call Mr. Conyers "Keith".

878
01:01:54,388 --> 01:01:56,688
'Cause my barf reflex is
really enheightened these days.

879
01:01:57,388 --> 01:01:58,388
But Keith's hot.

880
01:02:01,488 --> 01:02:03,188
Eww, he's all beardy!

881
01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:07,389
Did you hear that Bleek is going
to the prom with Katrina De Voort?

882
01:02:09,789 --> 01:02:10,689
Katrina?

883
01:02:11,289 --> 01:02:13,289
No way, he doesn't like Katrina.

884
01:02:13,589 --> 01:02:14,989
Must be like a pity date or something.

885
01:02:15,289 --> 01:02:17,689
I heard he asked her and
that they're going to Benihana,

886
01:02:17,724 --> 01:02:19,689
and then prom, and then
Vijay's parents' cabin.

887
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:23,290
He told me that Katrina's
house smells like soup!

888
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:25,090
Oh my God, it totally does.

889
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:28,890
I was there four years ago for her birthday
party and it was like Lipton Landing.

890
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:32,290
But you know, boys have endured
way worse things for nookie.

891
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:34,890
Oh, please.

892
01:02:35,191 --> 01:02:37,191
There is no way that they're having sex,

893
01:02:37,491 --> 01:02:38,891
They wouldn't even be holding hands.

894
01:02:39,191 --> 01:02:40,791
I wouldn't be so sure,
he did it with you.

895
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:42,991
Yeah, 'cause Bleek trusts me.

896
01:02:43,691 --> 01:02:44,691
We're best friends.

897
01:02:45,091 --> 01:02:46,291
Are you jealous?

898
01:02:46,791 --> 01:02:49,791
I thought you said you
didn't care what he did.

899
01:02:50,091 --> 01:02:51,092
Not jealous, don't care.

900
01:02:51,292 --> 01:02:53,357
I know Bleek doesn't like
Katrina and he shouldn't

901
01:02:53,392 --> 01:02:55,592
toy with her emotions like
that. She seems pretty nice.

902
01:02:56,292 --> 01:02:58,292
Uh-huh, I'm really convinced.

903
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:00,292
Prom is for wenises, anyway.

904
01:03:00,492 --> 01:03:02,592
As soon as you're old enough
to go, it's so not cool anymore.

905
01:03:12,893 --> 01:03:15,293
Are you honestly and truly going
to the prom with Katrina De Voort?

906
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:17,893
Uh, hi?

907
01:03:18,193 --> 01:03:20,293
Leah just said that you
were gonna go with her.

908
01:03:20,694 --> 01:03:22,694
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go.

909
01:03:23,694 --> 01:03:26,094
A bunch of us from the
team are going to Benihana,

910
01:03:26,129 --> 01:03:28,494
then go the prom, then go
to Vijay's parents' cabin.

911
01:03:31,794 --> 01:03:33,694
We're getting a stretch limo.

912
01:03:34,494 --> 01:03:36,595
Your mom must be pretty stoked
that you're not taking me.

913
01:03:38,795 --> 01:03:39,695
You're mad. Why are you mad?

914
01:03:41,195 --> 01:03:42,895
I'm not mad. I'm in a great mood.

915
01:03:43,295 --> 01:03:45,695
Despite the fact that I'm in
a fat suit I can't take off,

916
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:47,995
despite the fact that pretty
much everyone is making

917
01:03:48,595 --> 01:03:51,196
fun of me behind my back,
despite the fact that your

918
01:03:51,231 --> 01:03:53,796
girlfriend gave me the
stinkeye in art class yesterday.

919
01:03:54,696 --> 01:03:57,696
Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I
doubt that she gave you the stinkeye.

920
01:03:58,996 --> 01:04:00,096
That's just the way her face looks.

921
01:04:03,796 --> 01:04:08,897
Just take Soupy Sales to prom, I can think
of so many cooler things to do that night.

922
01:04:09,297 --> 01:04:12,897
I might pumice my feet or go
to Bren's Unitarian church,

923
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:16,297
maybe get hit by a truck
full of hot garbage juice.

924
01:04:16,797 --> 01:04:20,297
All those things would be exponentially
cooler than going to the prom with you.

925
01:04:23,798 --> 01:04:24,998
You're being really immature.

926
01:04:27,098 --> 01:04:30,398
You have no reason to be mad
at me. You broke my heart.

927
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:32,698
I should be royally ticked off at you.

928
01:04:33,098 --> 01:04:36,598
I should be really cheesed off. I
shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.

929
01:04:38,299 --> 01:04:42,099
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with
you, and then I didn't wanna, like, marry you?

930
01:04:42,499 --> 01:04:45,599
Like I'd marry you! You'd
be the meanest wife ever.

931
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:47,099
And I know that you
weren't bored that day

932
01:04:47,299 --> 01:04:48,964
because there was a lot of stuff on TV.

933
01:04:48,999 --> 01:04:51,799
The Blair Witch Project was
coming on Starz, and you were like,

934
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:57,800
"I haven't seen this since it came out,
but we should make out instead. La la la."

935
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,100
You just take Katrina the
Douche Packer to the prom.

936
01:05:03,135 --> 01:05:05,100
I'm sure you two will
have a real bitchin' time!

937
01:05:08,001 --> 01:05:09,101
I still have your underwear.

938
01:05:09,501 --> 01:05:10,901
I still have your virginity!

939
01:05:11,701 --> 01:05:12,701
Would you shut up!

940
01:05:13,201 --> 01:05:14,701
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?

941
01:05:15,501 --> 01:05:16,601
- No.
- 'Cause at least

942
01:05:16,801 --> 01:05:18,901
you don't have to have the
evidence under your sweater.

943
01:05:21,401 --> 01:05:22,401
I'm a planet!

944
01:05:26,902 --> 01:05:28,102
Wait, let me get your bag.

945
01:05:29,302 --> 01:05:30,502
What's another ten pounds?

946
01:06:17,605 --> 01:06:18,505
Hi.

947
01:06:18,905 --> 01:06:20,205
Wow. That shirt's working hard.

948
01:06:20,605 --> 01:06:21,505
Is Vanessa here?

949
01:06:21,905 --> 01:06:23,606
No. We are safe.

950
01:06:25,806 --> 01:06:27,406
I'm glad you're here, I
actually have something for you.

951
01:06:32,306 --> 01:06:33,306
Almost there.

952
01:06:37,406 --> 01:06:39,807
Whoah, Mark! Is this the
baby's room? It's beautiful!

953
01:06:41,007 --> 01:06:41,807
Hilarious.

954
01:06:42,307 --> 01:06:44,207
This is where I keep all my old comics,

955
01:06:45,007 --> 01:06:45,907
And I want to show you one.

956
01:06:46,907 --> 01:06:48,207
You're one of those guys?

957
01:06:48,307 --> 01:06:49,507
Take a look.

958
01:06:53,107 --> 01:06:54,708
Most Fruitful Yuki?

959
01:06:56,208 --> 01:06:57,608
Is this a pregnant superhero?

960
01:06:58,208 --> 01:06:59,108
Isn't that great?

961
01:06:59,408 --> 01:07:00,708
I found it in Japan when
I was there with my band.

962
01:07:00,743 --> 01:07:01,308
It reminds me of you.

963
01:07:02,208 --> 01:07:03,308
Hells, yeah!

964
01:07:04,308 --> 01:07:07,408
This actually makes me
feel way less of a fat dork.

965
01:07:09,509 --> 01:07:10,474
Yuki is a real bad ass.

966
01:07:10,509 --> 01:07:12,809
You should be very proud
being in the same condition.

967
01:07:14,409 --> 01:07:15,109
Thank you.

968
01:07:16,409 --> 01:07:17,509
Oh, how about some tunage?

969
01:07:19,009 --> 01:07:20,609
Alright, don't look, no matter what.

970
01:07:23,609 --> 01:07:25,675
This one is actually kinda slow.

971
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:30,110
But it's Mott the Hoople so it's
still totally rad and hardcore.

972
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:36,610
I know this one.

973
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:39,811
- You do?
- Yeah, this song is older than I am.

974
01:07:40,211 --> 01:07:42,011
I danced to this at my senior prom.

975
01:07:43,511 --> 01:07:44,811
Who'd you dance with?

976
01:07:45,611 --> 01:07:47,176
Cynthia Vogel, great dance partner.

977
01:07:47,211 --> 01:07:49,411
She let me put my
hands all over her butt.

978
01:07:49,611 --> 01:07:50,811
- Hot.
- Very hot.

979
01:07:52,411 --> 01:07:54,611
I can just, totally,
picture you dancing,

980
01:07:55,212 --> 01:07:56,812
Like a total dork!

981
01:08:00,012 --> 01:08:03,412
Her hands there,

982
01:08:04,312 --> 01:08:05,412
And my hands down here.

983
01:08:06,212 --> 01:08:07,712
This is how we did it in '88.

984
01:08:08,112 --> 01:08:09,112
Like this?

985
01:08:09,512 --> 01:08:10,413
Just like this.

986
01:08:10,613 --> 01:08:12,013
You've never been to a dance before?

987
01:08:12,313 --> 01:08:13,613
Dances are for nerds and squares.

988
01:08:15,113 --> 01:08:15,913
What are you?

989
01:08:16,913 --> 01:08:17,913
I don't know.

990
01:08:20,313 --> 01:08:21,613
I feel like there's
something between us.

991
01:08:39,614 --> 01:08:40,615
I'm leaving Vanessa.

992
01:08:44,215 --> 01:08:44,915
What?

993
01:08:45,315 --> 01:08:46,980
I'm getting a place in the city.

994
01:08:47,015 --> 01:08:49,615
It's something I've wanted
to do for a long time.

995
01:08:49,915 --> 01:08:50,615
No!

996
01:08:51,415 --> 01:08:52,015
No?

997
01:08:52,415 --> 01:08:54,015
No! You definitely can't do that.

998
01:08:54,215 --> 01:08:55,415
That's one big, fat sack of no!

999
01:08:57,816 --> 01:08:58,816
What is the matter?

1000
01:09:00,116 --> 01:09:03,116
You guys are supposed
to take care of this.

1001
01:09:04,716 --> 01:09:07,316
I thought you'd be cool with this.

1002
01:09:07,616 --> 01:09:09,281
I want things to be perfect.

1003
01:09:09,316 --> 01:09:13,717
I don't want them to be shitty and
broken like everyone else's family.

1004
01:09:15,617 --> 01:09:19,217
Look, I'll have the baby, and
Vanessa is going to be so happy.

1005
01:09:20,117 --> 01:09:21,717
A baby is not going to fix everything.

1006
01:09:22,017 --> 01:09:24,517
Besides, I don't know if I'm
even ready to be a father.

1007
01:09:25,117 --> 01:09:26,118
But you're old!

1008
01:09:30,718 --> 01:09:31,718
How do you think of me?

1009
01:09:32,818 --> 01:09:34,118
Why are you over here?

1010
01:09:37,818 --> 01:09:38,918
I...

1011
01:09:39,818 --> 01:09:43,119
I just like being a piece of
furniture in your weird life.

1012
01:09:44,519 --> 01:09:48,119
This is what my life has
become. I got stuff in boxes.

1013
01:09:48,154 --> 01:09:51,019
I'm underground.
That's appealing to you?

1014
01:09:51,419 --> 01:09:52,619
- This is my fault.
- No.

1015
01:09:52,819 --> 01:09:54,619
Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?

1016
01:09:55,219 --> 01:09:57,420
That's got nothing to do with it.
Vanessa and I aren't in love anymore.

1017
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,720
You were in love when you married her!

1018
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,785
If you're in love once,
you can be in love again.

1019
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:05,720
My friend Leah has been with the
same guy four different times.

1020
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:07,920
You're just not trying hard enough.

1021
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:09,220
I'm such an idiot. I can't
believe what an idiot I am.

1022
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:10,320
No, you know what, Mark.

1023
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:13,021
Do not divorce your wife!

1024
01:10:14,321 --> 01:10:17,521
Will you please just do me a
solid and stay with Vanessa?

1025
01:10:20,021 --> 01:10:20,821
You're so young.

1026
01:10:21,521 --> 01:10:22,886
I'm not that young.
I'm sixteen.

1027
01:10:22,921 --> 01:10:25,921
I'm old enough to know when
someone's acting like a total a-hole!

1028
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:28,022
Oh, and you know what,

1029
01:10:29,122 --> 01:10:32,422
I bought another Sonic Youth album
and it sucks! It's just noise!

1030
01:10:38,422 --> 01:10:39,622
Juno? What's going on?

1031
01:10:41,222 --> 01:10:41,922
Nothing.

1032
01:10:43,023 --> 01:10:43,723
Why are you crying?

1033
01:10:44,823 --> 01:10:47,623
I'm not crying. I'm just
allergic to fine home furnishings.

1034
01:10:49,323 --> 01:10:50,123
What's the matter?

1035
01:10:50,823 --> 01:10:51,923
What's the matter?

1036
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:55,123
She's just a little
hormonal. Right, Juno?

1037
01:10:55,158 --> 01:10:56,723
It's part of the process.

1038
01:11:01,124 --> 01:11:02,124
What did you do?

1039
01:11:04,624 --> 01:11:05,524
I didn't do anything...

1040
01:11:07,624 --> 01:11:08,524
Just...

1041
01:11:13,225 --> 01:11:14,125
I've been thinking.

1042
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:17,825
- What?
- Just thinking if this is the right thing.

1043
01:11:19,825 --> 01:11:20,725
What are you talking about?

1044
01:11:22,925 --> 01:11:23,825
Just wondering if it's,

1045
01:11:24,925 --> 01:11:25,725
Just wondering if we're ready.

1046
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:28,426
Yeah, we're ready.

1047
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:31,826
We're ready. We've read the
books, we've taken all the classes.

1048
01:11:31,861 --> 01:11:33,726
We have a nursery that is completely...

1049
01:11:34,226 --> 01:11:39,526
Vanessa, I know we're prepared.
I'm just wondering if... I'm ready.

1050
01:11:44,927 --> 01:11:45,727
Wait a minute.

1051
01:11:46,227 --> 01:11:49,327
Juno, don't listen to him.
He's just got cold feet.

1052
01:11:49,827 --> 01:11:50,927
He's just being a guy.

1053
01:11:51,227 --> 01:11:52,492
The books all say the same thing.

1054
01:11:52,527 --> 01:11:54,527
A woman becomes a mother
when she gets pregnant.

1055
01:11:54,927 --> 01:11:57,127
A man becomes a father
when he sees his baby.

1056
01:11:58,628 --> 01:12:01,128
He's going to get there.

1057
01:12:01,628 --> 01:12:02,393
It just happened so fast.

1058
01:12:02,428 --> 01:12:05,528
We put the ad in the paper and I thought
it was gonna take months if at all and then,

1059
01:12:06,128 --> 01:12:08,328
Two weeks later, she's on that couch.

1060
01:12:08,828 --> 01:12:09,928
She answered our prayers.

1061
01:12:10,228 --> 01:12:13,028
Ever since then it's
been like a ticking clock.

1062
01:12:16,929 --> 01:12:18,429
What are you saying?

1063
01:12:21,529 --> 01:12:23,129
That it feels a little like bad timing.

1064
01:12:26,729 --> 01:12:28,729
What would be a good time for you, Mark?

1065
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:32,630
There's just some things
that I still want to do.

1066
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:35,030
Like what? Be a rock star?

1067
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:37,330
Don't mock me.

1068
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:40,230
I'm just saying that this is,

1069
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:42,930
This is something that's
never going to happen.

1070
01:12:47,831 --> 01:12:48,731
Your shirt is stupid.

1071
01:12:50,531 --> 01:12:51,331
Grow up.

1072
01:12:52,131 --> 01:12:54,231
If I have to wait for
you to become Kurt Cobain,

1073
01:12:54,266 --> 01:12:55,631
I'm never going to be a mother.

1074
01:13:00,232 --> 01:13:01,432
I never said I'd be a good father.

1075
01:15:57,843 --> 01:16:01,443
I called Gerta Rauss and she said
that she can represent both of us.

1076
01:16:01,478 --> 01:16:03,544
It's called a "collaborative divorce."

1077
01:16:05,144 --> 01:16:06,544
It's all the rage right now, supposedly.

1078
01:16:07,644 --> 01:16:09,244
And it would be pretty easy
because we don't have any children.

1079
01:16:10,244 --> 01:16:11,444
Thanks for making the call, I guess.

1080
01:16:19,645 --> 01:16:20,745
Have you found a place to stay yet?

1081
01:16:21,645 --> 01:16:24,245
- Yeah, downtown.
- A hotel?

1082
01:16:24,645 --> 01:16:26,745
No, it's not a hotel. It's a loft.

1083
01:16:27,845 --> 01:16:28,945
Aren't you the cool guy?

1084
01:16:35,146 --> 01:16:36,346
I wanted a baby so bad.

1085
01:16:37,846 --> 01:16:38,946
I know.

1086
01:16:59,147 --> 01:17:00,947
- It looks like a bill from
Jiffy-Lube. - It's for me.

1087
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:45,900
I never realize how much
I like being home unless

1088
01:17:45,935 --> 01:17:48,050
I've been somewhere really
different for a while.

1089
01:17:57,351 --> 01:17:58,251
Hey, Dad.

1090
01:17:58,551 --> 01:17:59,851
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug.

1091
01:18:01,451 --> 01:18:02,251
Where have you been?

1092
01:18:02,551 --> 01:18:05,752
Dealing with things way
beyond my maturity level.

1093
01:18:09,252 --> 01:18:10,252
Where is everybody?

1094
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:13,552
Bren took Liberty Bell to
her tot ice skating class.

1095
01:18:15,052 --> 01:18:17,452
When will you guys learn
that tots can't ice skate?

1096
01:18:19,553 --> 01:18:20,853
You're looking a little morose, honey.

1097
01:18:21,753 --> 01:18:22,653
What's eating you?

1098
01:18:31,353 --> 01:18:33,553
I'm just, like, losing
my faith with humanity.

1099
01:18:34,754 --> 01:18:36,154
Can you narrow that down for me?

1100
01:18:38,054 --> 01:18:38,854
I just...

1101
01:18:39,254 --> 01:18:40,154
...wonder if...

1102
01:18:41,854 --> 01:18:43,854
...two people can
stay together for good.

1103
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:46,354
You mean like couples?

1104
01:18:46,754 --> 01:18:47,554
Yeah, like,

1105
01:18:47,954 --> 01:18:49,054
People in love.

1106
01:18:50,655 --> 01:18:52,820
Are you having boy trouble
'cause I gotta be honest;

1107
01:18:52,855 --> 01:18:55,255
I don't really much approve of
you dating in your condition,

1108
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,655
That's kind of messed up.

1109
01:18:57,755 --> 01:18:58,555
No, dad!

1110
01:18:59,255 --> 01:19:00,155
I mean, that's pretty skanky.

1111
01:19:00,455 --> 01:19:02,355
Isn't that what you girls
call it? Skanky? Skeevy?

1112
01:19:02,455 --> 01:19:03,655
Please stop.

1113
01:19:04,055 --> 01:19:04,856
Tore up from the floor up?

1114
01:19:05,256 --> 01:19:07,256
That's not what it's about.

1115
01:19:11,456 --> 01:19:17,856
I just need to know that it's possible that
two people can stay happy together forever.

1116
01:19:19,456 --> 01:19:20,757
It's not easy, that's for sure.

1117
01:19:22,057 --> 01:19:25,257
I don't have the best track
record in the world, I know, but,

1118
01:19:26,557 --> 01:19:28,357
I've been with your
stepmother for ten years now,

1119
01:19:29,457 --> 01:19:30,757
and I'm proud to say
that we're very happy.

1120
01:19:33,157 --> 01:19:34,057
Look...

1121
01:19:35,358 --> 01:19:36,358
...In my opinion...

1122
01:19:37,158 --> 01:19:42,858
The best thing you can do is find a person
who loves you for exactly what you are.

1123
01:19:44,758 --> 01:19:47,558
Good mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty,

1124
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:49,958
Handsome, what have you,

1125
01:19:51,759 --> 01:19:54,059
the right person is still gonna
think the sun shines out of your ass.

1126
01:19:58,059 --> 01:19:59,459
That's the kind of person
that's worth sticking with.

1127
01:20:01,059 --> 01:20:01,659
Yeah.

1128
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:07,760
I think I've found that person.

1129
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:10,260
Yeah, sure you
have. Your old D-A-D!

1130
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:15,360
You know I'll always be there to love you, support
you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.

1131
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:18,260
Obviously.

1132
01:20:23,561 --> 01:20:24,461
Dad, I think I'm just gonna,

1133
01:20:25,561 --> 01:20:26,961
shove out for a sec, but,

1134
01:20:27,661 --> 01:20:28,961
I won't be home late.

1135
01:20:29,561 --> 01:20:30,361
Okay.

1136
01:20:31,761 --> 01:20:32,861
You were talking about me, right?

1137
01:20:34,161 --> 01:20:34,861
Oh, yeah.

1138
01:21:31,365 --> 01:21:32,465
Hi.

1139
01:21:34,865 --> 01:21:37,366
Did you put like a hundred
things of tic tacs in my mailbox?

1140
01:21:38,066 --> 01:21:39,366
Oh, yeah, that was me.

1141
01:21:40,666 --> 01:21:41,566
Why?

1142
01:21:41,866 --> 01:21:43,366
They're your fave.

1143
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:46,966
You can never have too many of your
favorite one-calorie breath mint.

1144
01:21:47,866 --> 01:21:49,766
Yeah, well thanks, I...

1145
01:21:50,066 --> 01:21:52,967
...I think I'm pretty much set
until college on the tic tac front.

1146
01:21:54,267 --> 01:21:55,467
You know, Bleek, I was thinking.

1147
01:21:56,067 --> 01:21:59,767
I'm sorry I was such a huge bitch
to you. You don't deserve it.

1148
01:22:01,067 --> 01:22:03,167
It's okay.

1149
01:22:04,867 --> 01:22:05,867
Also,

1150
01:22:08,268 --> 01:22:09,268
I think I'm in love with you.

1151
01:22:12,068 --> 01:22:13,268
What, you mean as friends?

1152
01:22:14,068 --> 01:22:14,868
No.

1153
01:22:15,868 --> 01:22:17,068
I mean, for real.

1154
01:22:17,968 --> 01:22:21,368
Because you're, like, the
coolest person I've ever met.

1155
01:22:21,968 --> 01:22:23,869
And you don't even have to try.

1156
01:22:26,469 --> 01:22:27,769
I try really hard, actually.

1157
01:22:28,169 --> 01:22:29,569
You're, like, naturally smart.

1158
01:22:30,769 --> 01:22:31,869
You're not like everyone else.

1159
01:22:32,569 --> 01:22:34,969
You don't stare at my stomach
all the time, you look at my face.

1160
01:22:35,669 --> 01:22:41,270
And every time I see you, the
baby starts kicking super hard.

1161
01:22:42,370 --> 01:22:43,470
It does?

1162
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:58,671
I think it's because my heart
starts pounding every time I see you.

1163
01:23:00,171 --> 01:23:01,071
Mine too.

1164
01:23:03,971 --> 01:23:05,671
That's all I could ask for.

1165
01:23:09,172 --> 01:23:10,272
You're golden, man.

1166
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,172
Can we make out now?

1167
01:23:16,572 --> 01:23:17,772
Yeah.

1168
01:23:30,173 --> 01:23:33,773
You know, you can go into early
labor sucking face like that!

1169
01:23:57,975 --> 01:23:58,975
Dad!

1170
01:24:00,075 --> 01:24:00,875
What?

1171
01:24:01,775 --> 01:24:03,675
Dad, either I just peed my pants or...

1172
01:24:05,475 --> 01:24:06,375
Or?

1173
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:09,175
Thundercats are go!

1174
01:24:09,476 --> 01:24:10,276
All out, all out!

1175
01:24:11,476 --> 01:24:12,476
Do you have the admittance form?

1176
01:24:12,776 --> 01:24:14,276
What about the parking stickers?

1177
01:24:14,476 --> 01:24:15,576
Have you got Liberty Bell?

1178
01:24:15,776 --> 01:24:17,776
Oh, sweetie, sweetie!

1179
01:24:21,676 --> 01:24:22,476
Here we go.

1180
01:24:25,877 --> 01:24:27,177
Hurry! Start the car, go!

1181
01:24:27,777 --> 01:24:29,077
Gas!

1182
01:24:33,477 --> 01:24:35,777
- Wait, wait!
- Out of the way!

1183
01:24:39,577 --> 01:24:40,878
- Don't do that.
- What?

1184
01:24:41,278 --> 01:24:42,778
- That.
- But it's fun!

1185
01:24:45,478 --> 01:24:47,278
Bren, when do I get that
friggin' Spinal Tap thing?

1186
01:24:48,078 --> 01:24:50,578
It's called a spinal block, and
you can't have it yet, honey.

1187
01:24:50,613 --> 01:24:52,478
The doctor said you're
not dilated enough.

1188
01:24:52,878 --> 01:24:55,579
Come on! I have to wait
for it to get worse?

1189
01:24:55,614 --> 01:24:58,279
Why can't I just have
the friggin' thing now?

1190
01:24:58,879 --> 01:25:02,479
Honey, doctors are sadists who like to
play God and watch lesser people scream.

1191
01:25:03,779 --> 01:25:04,579
Oh, shit.

1192
01:25:05,279 --> 01:25:08,679
Excuse me! Can we give my kid
the damn spinal tap already?

1193
01:25:38,381 --> 01:25:39,281
And then...

1194
01:25:40,181 --> 01:25:41,582
...out of nowhere...

1195
01:25:42,782 --> 01:25:43,582
...there it was...

1196
01:25:45,282 --> 01:25:46,482
There he was.

1197
01:25:53,582 --> 01:25:55,883
I decided not to call Bleeker to
tell him that I was having the baby.

1198
01:25:56,583 --> 01:26:00,683
He had a big meet against Manteno and I
didn't want him to get all worried about me.

1199
01:26:06,383 --> 01:26:07,483
But he figured it out anyway.

1200
01:26:25,484 --> 01:26:27,185
Someday you'll be back here, honey.

1201
01:26:29,885 --> 01:26:30,985
On your terms.

1202
01:26:43,486 --> 01:26:44,486
Hey.

1203
01:26:45,286 --> 01:26:47,286
Nice legs.

1204
01:27:29,089 --> 01:27:30,689
Bleeker decided he didn't
want to see the baby.

1205
01:27:32,689 --> 01:27:35,589
Neither did I, really.
He didn't feel like ours.

1206
01:27:43,190 --> 01:27:44,790
I think he was always hers.

1207
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:50,990
Would you like to meet your son?

1208
01:27:53,290 --> 01:27:55,290
I have a son?

1209
01:28:23,392 --> 01:28:24,192
How do I look?

1210
01:28:25,992 --> 01:28:26,892
Like a new mom.

1211
01:28:27,692 --> 01:28:28,893
Scared shitless.

1212
01:28:54,994 --> 01:28:56,494
It ended with a chair.

1213
01:29:52,998 --> 01:29:58,698
As boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is totally
boss. He is the cheese to my macaroni.

1214
01:30:01,099 --> 01:30:03,799
I know people are supposed to fall
in love before they reproduce, but,

1215
01:30:04,999 --> 01:30:06,599
I guess normalcy's not really our style.

1216
01:30:13,799 --> 01:30:14,499
Hey.

1217
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,200
Hey.

1218
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:21,900
Ready?

1219
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:23,500
Yeah.
