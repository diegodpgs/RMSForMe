1
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:30,944
Forget it. It's too risky.

2
00:00:30,986 --> 00:00:32,571
I'm through doing that shit.

3
00:00:32,613 --> 00:00:35,115
You always say that,
the same thing every time.

4
00:00:35,156 --> 00:00:37,826
"I'm through, never again,
too dangerous."

5
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:40,413
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right, too.

6
00:00:40,454 --> 00:00:42,373
But you forget about it
in a day or two.

7
00:00:42,415 --> 00:00:43,875
Well, the days of me
forgetting are over...

8
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,128
and the days of me remembering
have just begun.

9
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,546
You know when you go on
like this what you sound like?

10
00:00:48,588 --> 00:00:50,674
I sound like
a sensible fucking man.

11
00:00:50,716 --> 00:00:52,676
You sound like a duck.
Quack, quack, quack...

12
00:00:52,718 --> 00:00:54,679
Take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again...

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,473
since I'm never
gonna do it again...

14
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,724
you're never gonna
have to hear me quack...

15
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,184
about how I'm never
gonna do it again.

16
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,309
After tonight.

17
00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:02,520
Correct.
I got all tonight to quack.

18
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,149
Can I get anyone more coffee?

19
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:09,404
Oh, yes. Thank you.

20
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:10,947
You're welcome.

21
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:13,742
I mean, the way it is now...

22
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:16,746
you're taking the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

23
00:01:16,746 --> 00:01:18,790
You take more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

24
00:01:18,832 --> 00:01:20,292
Federal banks
ain't supposed to stop you...

25
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,793
in any way during a robbery.

26
00:01:21,835 --> 00:01:23,838
They're insured.
Why should they give a fuck?

27
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:26,506
You don't even need a gun
in a federal bank.

28
00:01:26,548 --> 00:01:28,008
I heard about
this one bloke...

29
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:29,927
He walks into a bank
with a portable phone.

30
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:31,554
He gives the phone
to the teller...

31
00:01:31,554 --> 00:01:33,056
bloke on the other end
of the phone says...

32
00:01:33,056 --> 00:01:34,516
"We got this guy's little girl.

33
00:01:34,558 --> 00:01:36,059
"If you don't give him
all your money...

34
00:01:36,059 --> 00:01:37,728
- "we're gonna kill her."
- Did it work?

35
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,272
Fucking way, it works.
That's what I'm talking about!

36
00:01:40,314 --> 00:01:42,316
Knucklehead walks into a bank
with a telephone...

37
00:01:42,316 --> 00:01:44,277
not a pistol, not a shotgun...

38
00:01:44,277 --> 00:01:46,279
a fucking phone.
Cleans the place out.

39
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:48,115
They don't even lift
a fucking finger.

40
00:01:48,156 --> 00:01:49,783
Did they hurt the little girl?

41
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:52,786
I don't know. Probably never was
a girl in the first place.

42
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:55,164
The point isn't the girl.
The point is...

43
00:01:55,205 --> 00:01:56,999
they robbed a bank
with a telephone.

44
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,710
You want to rob banks?

45
00:01:58,751 --> 00:01:59,919
I'm not saying
I want to rob banks.

46
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:02,589
If we did, it would be easier
than what we been doing.

47
00:02:02,631 --> 00:02:04,048
No more liquor stores?

48
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,802
What we been talking about?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.

49
00:02:06,843 --> 00:02:08,345
Besides, it ain't the giggle
it used to be.

50
00:02:08,387 --> 00:02:10,014
There's too many foreigners
own liquor stores.

51
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:11,933
Vietnamese, Koreans, they don't
even speak fucking English.

52
00:02:11,974 --> 00:02:13,351
You tell 'em,
"Empty out the register..."

53
00:02:13,393 --> 00:02:14,811
they don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

54
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:16,146
They make it too personal.

55
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:18,231
We keep on, one of these gook
fucker's gonna make us kill him.

56
00:02:18,273 --> 00:02:20,108
I'm not gonna kill anybody.

57
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,902
I don't want to kill anybody,
either.

58
00:02:21,944 --> 00:02:23,529
But they'll probably
put us in a situation...

59
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:25,281
where it's us or them.

60
00:02:25,281 --> 00:02:27,575
And if it's not the gooks,
it's these old fucking Jews...

61
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:29,744
who've owned the store
for fifteen fucking generations.

62
00:02:29,785 --> 00:02:32,580
You got Grandpa Irving
sitting behind the counter...

63
00:02:32,622 --> 00:02:34,082
with a fucking Magnum
in his hand.

64
00:02:34,124 --> 00:02:36,251
Try walking into one of those
places with nothing but a phone.

65
00:02:36,293 --> 00:02:38,588
See how far that gets you.
Fuck it. We're out of it.

66
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:41,049
Yeah, well, what then?
Day jobs?

67
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:43,260
- Not in this life.
- What, then?

68
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:47,306
Garçon! Coffee!

69
00:02:47,348 --> 00:02:48,766
This place.

70
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:53,105
Garçon means "boy."

71
00:02:57,734 --> 00:03:00,529
This place? A coffee shop?

72
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:02,115
What's wrong with that?

73
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,288
Nobody ever robs restaurants.
Why not?

74
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:11,834
Bars, liquor stores,
gas stations...

75
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,170
you get your head blown off
sticking up one of them.

76
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:17,799
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.

77
00:03:17,841 --> 00:03:19,801
They're not expecting
to get robbed.

78
00:03:19,843 --> 00:03:21,344
Not as expecting, anyway.

79
00:03:21,386 --> 00:03:24,181
I bet you could
cut down on the hero factor...

80
00:03:24,222 --> 00:03:25,516
in a place like this.

81
00:03:25,557 --> 00:03:26,600
Correct.

82
00:03:26,642 --> 00:03:29,729
Same as banks,
these places are insured.

83
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:32,190
Manager... he don't give a fuck.

84
00:03:32,232 --> 00:03:33,691
He's just trying
to get you out the door...

85
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:35,193
before you start
plugging the diners.

86
00:03:35,235 --> 00:03:36,778
Waitresses? Fucking forget it.

87
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,989
No way they're taking a bullet
for the register.

88
00:03:39,031 --> 00:03:42,368
Busboys, some wetback
getting paid $1.50 an hour...

89
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,913
really give a fuck
you're stealing from the owner?

90
00:03:44,955 --> 00:03:46,956
Customers sitting
with food in their mouths.

91
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:48,082
They don't know
what's going on.

92
00:03:48,124 --> 00:03:49,626
One minute they're
having a Denver omelet...

93
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:52,671
next minute, someone's
sticking a gun in their face.

94
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:55,174
See, I got the idea...

95
00:03:55,216 --> 00:03:57,552
last liquor store we stuck up.
Remember?

96
00:03:57,594 --> 00:03:59,178
All the customers
kept coming in?

97
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,721
Yeah.

98
00:04:00,763 --> 00:04:02,557
You got the idea
taking their wallets.

99
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,643
Mm-hmm.
- Now, that was a good idea.

100
00:04:04,684 --> 00:04:06,145
Thank you.

101
00:04:06,186 --> 00:04:07,855
Made more from the wallets
than we did from the register.

102
00:04:07,897 --> 00:04:10,483
Yes, we did.
- People come to restaurants.

103
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:12,152
A lot of wallets.

104
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:14,154
Pretty smart, huh?

105
00:04:14,238 --> 00:04:16,323
Pretty smart.

106
00:04:18,368 --> 00:04:20,829
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.

107
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,707
Come on.
- All right.

108
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:25,458
Same as last time, remember?

109
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,295
You're crowd control.
I handle employees.

110
00:04:33,802 --> 00:04:35,262
I love you, Pumpkin.

111
00:04:35,303 --> 00:04:37,013
I love you, Honey Bunny.

112
00:04:38,097 --> 00:04:40,225
Everybody, be cool!
This is a robbery!

113
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:43,479
Any of you
fucking pricks move...

114
00:04:43,521 --> 00:04:47,233
and I'll execute every
motherfucking last one of you!

115
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:53,698
Ha ha ha

116
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,405
Jungle boogie,
Jungle boogie

117
00:06:42,446 --> 00:06:45,658
- Get it on
- Jungle boogie

118
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,994
- Jungle boogie
- Get it on

119
00:06:48,035 --> 00:06:50,121
- Jungle boogie
- Get up with the boogie

120
00:06:50,163 --> 00:06:52,457
- Jungle boogie
- Get up with the get down

121
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:54,585
- Jungle boogie
- Get down with the boogie

122
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:57,170
- Jungle boogie
- Come and shake it around

123
00:07:05,388 --> 00:07:07,182
OK, so tell me again
about the hash bars.

124
00:07:07,224 --> 00:07:09,977
- OK. What you want to know?
- Hash is legal there, right?

125
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:11,563
Yeah, it's legal,
but it ain't 100% legal.

126
00:07:11,604 --> 00:07:14,066
You just can't walk
into a restaurant...

127
00:07:14,107 --> 00:07:16,110
roll a joint,
and start puffing away.

128
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:17,778
I mean, they want you to smoke
in your home...

129
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,740
- or certain designated places.
- And those are hash bars?

130
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,242
Yeah, it breaks down like this.

131
00:07:22,284 --> 00:07:24,744
It's legal to buy it,
it's legal to own it...

132
00:07:24,786 --> 00:07:26,871
and if you're the proprietor
of a hash bar...

133
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,373
it's legal to sell it.

134
00:07:28,373 --> 00:07:30,835
It's legal to carry it,
but... but that doesn't matter...

135
00:07:30,876 --> 00:07:32,587
'cause, get a load of this,
all right?

136
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:34,839
If you get stopped by a cop
in Amsterdam...

137
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,632
it's illegal
for them to search you.

138
00:07:36,674 --> 00:07:39,469
I mean, that's a right the cops
in Amsterdam don't have.

139
00:07:39,511 --> 00:07:42,014
Oh, man, I'm going.
That's all there is to it.

140
00:07:42,055 --> 00:07:43,557
I'm fucking going.

141
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,518
I know, baby.
You'd dig it the most.

142
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:48,896
But you know what the funniest
thing about Europe is?

143
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:50,940
- What?
- It's the little differences.

144
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:53,318
I mean, they got the same shit
over there that they got here...

145
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:55,696
but it's just
a little different.

146
00:07:55,737 --> 00:07:57,323
Example?

147
00:07:57,323 --> 00:08:00,243
You can go to a movie theater
in Amsterdam and buy a beer.

148
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:02,119
And I don't mean just, like,
in no paper cup.

149
00:08:02,161 --> 00:08:03,913
I'm talking about
a glass of beer.

150
00:08:03,954 --> 00:08:06,583
And in Paris, you can
buy a beer at McDonald's.

151
00:08:06,624 --> 00:08:08,084
And you know what they call...

152
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:11,714
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese
in Paris?

153
00:08:11,755 --> 00:08:13,382
They don't call it
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese?

154
00:08:13,424 --> 00:08:14,967
No, man, they got
the metric system there.

155
00:08:15,008 --> 00:08:16,844
They wouldn't know what the fuck
a Quarter-Pounder is.

156
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:18,304
What do they call it?

157
00:08:18,346 --> 00:08:20,765
They call it
a "Royale with Cheese."

158
00:08:20,807 --> 00:08:22,976
- "Royale with Cheese."
That's right.

159
00:08:23,018 --> 00:08:24,520
What do they call a Big Mac?

160
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:27,689
Big Mac's a Big Mac,
but they call it "Le Big Mac."

161
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:30,568
"Le Big Mac." Ha ha ha ha.

162
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:32,111
What do they call a Whopper?

163
00:08:32,153 --> 00:08:34,781
I don't know.
I didn't go into Burger King.

164
00:08:34,823 --> 00:08:36,742
You know what they put on
French fries in Holland...

165
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,744
- instead of ketchup?
- What?

166
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:40,746
- Mayonnaise.
- Goddamn!

167
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,749
Ha ha ha.
I've seen 'em do it, man.

168
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,418
They fucking drown 'em
in that shit.

169
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,128
Yuck.

170
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:51,509
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.

171
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:57,641
- How many up there?
- Three or four.

172
00:08:57,682 --> 00:08:59,643
That's counting our guy?

173
00:08:59,685 --> 00:09:01,353
I'm not sure.

174
00:09:01,395 --> 00:09:03,815
So that means it could be
up to five guys up there?

175
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:05,691
It's possible.

176
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:07,818
We should have fucking shotguns.

177
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,946
What's her name?
Mia.

178
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:12,991
Mia. How did Marsellus
and her meet?

179
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:16,245
I don't know.
However people meet people.

180
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,913
She used to be an actress.

181
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:20,374
Oh, really? She do anything
I'd have seen?

182
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,294
I think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot.

183
00:09:23,336 --> 00:09:24,838
Pilot? What's a pilot?

184
00:09:24,921 --> 00:09:27,091
Well, you know the shows on TV?

185
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:28,551
I don't watch TV.

186
00:09:28,592 --> 00:09:30,385
Yeah, but you are aware...

187
00:09:30,427 --> 00:09:32,096
that there's an invention
called television...

188
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:34,390
and on this invention
they show shows, right?

189
00:09:34,432 --> 00:09:35,516
Yeah.

190
00:09:35,558 --> 00:09:38,520
The way they pick TV shows,
they make one show.

191
00:09:38,562 --> 00:09:39,980
That show's called a pilot.

192
00:09:40,022 --> 00:09:42,400
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...

193
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,859
and on the strength
of that one show...

194
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,736
they decide if they want
to make more shows.

195
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:48,406
Some get chosen
and become television programs.

196
00:09:48,447 --> 00:09:51,076
Some don't, become nothing.

197
00:09:51,117 --> 00:09:53,996
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.

198
00:09:54,037 --> 00:09:58,291
You remember Antwan Rockamora?
Half-black, half-Samoan...

199
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,461
used to call him
"Tony Rocky Horror"?

200
00:10:00,502 --> 00:10:02,171
Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?

201
00:10:02,213 --> 00:10:04,048
I wouldn't go so far
as to call the brother fat.

202
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,550
I mean, he got a weight problem.

203
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,052
What's the nigger gonna do,
he's Samoan.

204
00:10:07,094 --> 00:10:09,180
Yeah, I think I know
who you mean. What about him?

205
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,432
Well,
Marsellus fucked him up good.

206
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:12,976
Word around the campfire is...

207
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:15,228
it was on account
of Marsellus Wallace's wife.

208
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:25,406
So, what'd he do, fuck her?

209
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:27,826
No, no, no, no, no.
Nothing that bad.

210
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:29,494
Well, then, what, then?

211
00:10:29,536 --> 00:10:31,413
Gave her a foot massage.

212
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:38,045
- A foot massage? That's it?
- Mm-hmm.

213
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:40,298
Then what did Marsellus do?

214
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,092
Sent a couple of cats
over to his place.

215
00:10:42,134 --> 00:10:45,304
They took him out on his patio,
threw his ass over the balcony.

216
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:47,347
Nigger fell four stories.

217
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:49,308
They had a little garden
down at the bottom...

218
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,561
enclosed in glass,
like a greenhouse.

219
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:53,855
Nigger fell through that.

220
00:10:53,897 --> 00:10:56,984
Since then, he kind of
developed a speech impediment.

221
00:10:58,444 --> 00:10:59,903
That's a damn shame.

222
00:11:05,868 --> 00:11:07,370
But still, I have to say...

223
00:11:07,412 --> 00:11:09,164
you play with matches,
you get burned.

224
00:11:09,206 --> 00:11:10,374
What do you mean?

225
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:12,542
You don't be giving
Marsellus Wallace's new bride...

226
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:13,919
a foot massage.

227
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,587
You don't think he overreacted?

228
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:18,007
Well, Antwan probably
didn't expect Marsellus...

229
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:21,511
to react the way he did,
but he had to expect a reaction.

230
00:11:21,553 --> 00:11:23,722
It was a foot massage.
A foot massage is nothing.

231
00:11:23,764 --> 00:11:25,306
I give my mother a foot massage.

232
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,392
No, it's laying hands
in a familiar way...

233
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:29,186
on Marsellus' new wife.

234
00:11:29,228 --> 00:11:31,814
I mean, is it as bad
as eating her pussy out?

235
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:34,150
No, but it's
the same fucking ballpark.

236
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:35,694
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
stop right there.

237
00:11:35,735 --> 00:11:37,821
Eating a bitch out and giving
a bitch a foot massage...

238
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,323
ain't even
the same fucking thing.

239
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,033
It's not.
It's the same ballpark.

240
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,077
Ain't no fucking ballpark,
neither.

241
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,248
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine...

242
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,042
but you know
touching his wife's feet...

243
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,835
and sticking your tongue
in her holiest of holies...

244
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:52,546
ain't the same fucking ballpark.
It ain't the same league.

245
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:54,090
It ain't even
the same fucking sport.

246
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:56,384
Look,
foot massages don't mean shit.

247
00:11:56,426 --> 00:11:58,428
Have you ever given
a foot massage?

248
00:11:58,428 --> 00:12:01,432
Don't be telling me
about foot massages.

249
00:12:01,432 --> 00:12:02,975
I'm the foot fucking master.

250
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:05,060
- You given a lot of 'em?
- Shit, yeah.

251
00:12:05,102 --> 00:12:06,562
Got my technique down
and everything.

252
00:12:06,604 --> 00:12:08,314
I don't be tickling or nothing.

253
00:12:08,356 --> 00:12:10,859
Would you give a guy
a foot massage?

254
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:14,196
Fuck you.

255
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:18,116
- You given 'em a lot?
- Fuck you.

256
00:12:18,158 --> 00:12:19,660
You know, I'm kind of tired.

257
00:12:19,702 --> 00:12:21,120
I could use
a foot massage myself.

258
00:12:21,162 --> 00:12:22,663
Yo, yo, yo, man.
You best back off.

259
00:12:22,705 --> 00:12:24,249
I'm getting
a little pissed here.

260
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:28,253
- This is the door.
- There it is.

261
00:12:31,548 --> 00:12:32,925
What time you got?

262
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:36,387
7:22 in the a.m.

263
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:40,016
No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.

264
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:50,653
Just 'cause I wouldn't give
no man a foot massage...

265
00:12:50,695 --> 00:12:51,905
don't make it right
for Marsellus...

266
00:12:51,946 --> 00:12:53,240
to throw Antwan
off a building...

267
00:12:53,281 --> 00:12:54,740
into a glass
motherfucking house...

268
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:57,285
fucking up the way the nigger
talks. That shit ain't right.

269
00:12:57,369 --> 00:12:59,788
Motherfucker do that shit to me,
he better paralyze my ass...

270
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:01,165
'cause I'd kill
the motherfucker...

271
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:03,167
- you know what I'm saying?
- I ain't saying it's right.

272
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:05,086
But you're saying a foot massage
don't mean nothing...

273
00:13:05,128 --> 00:13:06,671
and I'm saying it does.

274
00:13:06,713 --> 00:13:09,550
I've given a million ladies
a million foot massages...

275
00:13:09,591 --> 00:13:11,218
and they all meant something.

276
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,263
Now, we act like they don't,
but they do.

277
00:13:13,304 --> 00:13:15,140
That's what's so fucking cool
about 'em.

278
00:13:15,182 --> 00:13:17,726
There's a sensuous thing
going on where, you know...

279
00:13:17,768 --> 00:13:20,687
you don't talk about it, but you
know it, and she knows it.

280
00:13:20,687 --> 00:13:22,523
Fucking Marsellus knew it...

281
00:13:22,523 --> 00:13:25,610
and Antwan should've fucking
better known better.

282
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:27,403
I mean,
that's his fucking wife, man.

283
00:13:27,445 --> 00:13:30,157
This ain't a man with a sense
of humor about this shit.

284
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:31,700
You know what I'm saying?

285
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:35,203
It's an interesting point.

286
00:13:35,203 --> 00:13:37,331
Come on.
Let's get into character.

287
00:13:43,463 --> 00:13:44,965
What's her name again?

288
00:13:44,965 --> 00:13:46,800
- Mia.
- Mia.

289
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:49,052
Why you so interested
in big man's wife?

290
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:50,804
Well, he's going out of town,
Florida...

291
00:13:50,846 --> 00:13:54,475
and he asked me if I'd take care
of her while he's gone.

292
00:13:54,517 --> 00:13:57,688
- Take care of her?
- No, man. Just take her out.

293
00:13:57,688 --> 00:14:01,691
You know, show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get lonely.

294
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:04,528
You're gonna be taking
Mia Wallace out on a date?

295
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,697
It is not a date.

296
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:09,743
It's just like if you were going
to take your buddy's wife...

297
00:14:09,784 --> 00:14:11,327
to a movie or something.

298
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:13,371
It's just good company,
that's all.

299
00:14:19,086 --> 00:14:22,215
It's not a date.
It's definitely not a date.

300
00:14:30,265 --> 00:14:34,270
Hey, kids. How you boys doing?

301
00:14:34,312 --> 00:14:35,772
Hey, keep chilling.

302
00:14:43,489 --> 00:14:44,949
You know who we are?

303
00:14:46,535 --> 00:14:48,621
We're associates
of your business partner...

304
00:14:48,662 --> 00:14:50,413
Marsellus Wallace.

305
00:14:50,413 --> 00:14:53,125
You do remember your business
partner, don't you?

306
00:14:55,252 --> 00:14:57,338
Let me take a wild guess here.

307
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,845
- You're Brett, right?
- Yeah.

308
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:05,514
I thought so.

309
00:15:05,555 --> 00:15:08,100
You remember your business
partner Marsellus Wallace...

310
00:15:08,142 --> 00:15:10,353
don't you, Brett?

311
00:15:10,395 --> 00:15:11,896
Yeah, I remember him.

312
00:15:11,896 --> 00:15:13,315
Good.

313
00:15:13,356 --> 00:15:16,150
Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.

314
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:18,612
Sorry about that.
What you having?

315
00:15:19,988 --> 00:15:22,491
- Hamburgers.
- Hamburgers!

316
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:25,203
The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast.

317
00:15:25,203 --> 00:15:27,329
What kind of hamburgers?

318
00:15:28,831 --> 00:15:30,333
Ch-ch-cheeseburgers.

319
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,835
No, no, no, no.
Where'd you get 'em?

320
00:15:31,877 --> 00:15:34,338
McDonald's, Wendy's,
Jack-in-the-Box, where?

321
00:15:34,338 --> 00:15:36,674
Um, Big Kahuna Burger.

322
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:39,594
Big Kahuna Burger. That's
that Hawaiian burger joint.

323
00:15:39,636 --> 00:15:41,721
I hear they got
some tasty burgers.

324
00:15:41,762 --> 00:15:43,890
I ain't never had one myself.
How are they?

325
00:15:44,975 --> 00:15:46,435
They're good.

326
00:15:46,476 --> 00:15:49,355
You mind if I try one of yours?

327
00:15:49,355 --> 00:15:51,858
- This is yours here, right?
- Yeah.

328
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:04,455
Mmm! This is a tasty burger.

329
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:07,125
Vincent, you ever had
a Big Kahuna Burger?

330
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:10,838
Want a bite?
They're real tasty.

331
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,131
I ain't hungry.

332
00:16:12,173 --> 00:16:14,759
If you like burgers,
give 'em a try sometime.

333
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:17,095
Me, I can't usually get 'em...

334
00:16:17,137 --> 00:16:18,805
'cause my girlfriend's
a vegetarian...

335
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:21,933
which pretty much makes me
a vegetarian...

336
00:16:21,975 --> 00:16:25,980
But I do love the taste
of a good burger. Mmm.

337
00:16:26,022 --> 00:16:27,482
You know what they call...

338
00:16:27,523 --> 00:16:29,818
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese
in France?

339
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,903
- No.
- Tell him, Vincent.

340
00:16:31,944 --> 00:16:34,030
Royale with Cheese.

341
00:16:34,072 --> 00:16:37,284
Royale with Cheese.
You know why they call it that?

342
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:43,582
Because of the metric system?

343
00:16:43,624 --> 00:16:46,794
Check out the big brain
on Brett!

344
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:50,466
You're a smart motherfucker.
That's right. The metric system.

345
00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:54,137
What's in this?

346
00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:56,513
- Sprite.
- Sprite, good.

347
00:16:56,555 --> 00:16:58,975
You mind if I have
some of your tasty beverage...

348
00:16:59,016 --> 00:17:00,810
to wash this down with?

349
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:02,312
Go right ahead.

350
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,324
Ahh.

351
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,495
That hit the spot.

352
00:17:18,122 --> 00:17:21,833
You, Flock of Seagulls.
You know why we're here?

353
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,419
Why don't you tell
my man Vince here...

354
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,796
- where you got the shit hid at?
It's over there.

355
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,509
I don't remember asking you
a goddamn thing!

356
00:17:33,973 --> 00:17:37,143
- You were saying?
- It's in the cupboard.

357
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,274
N-no.
The one by your kn-knees.

358
00:18:03,506 --> 00:18:04,966
We happy?

359
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:09,638
Vincent? We happy?

360
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,559
Yeah, we happy.
Pbbbt.

361
00:18:13,601 --> 00:18:18,148
Look... I'm sorry, uh,
I... I didn't get your name.

362
00:18:18,189 --> 00:18:21,485
I got yours. Uh, Vincent, right?
But... but I... I never got yours.

363
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:22,820
My name's Pitt...

364
00:18:22,862 --> 00:18:25,198
and your ass ain't talking
your way out of this shit.

365
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:26,699
No, no, no.

366
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,119
I just want you to know how...

367
00:18:33,707 --> 00:18:35,542
I just want you to know
how sorry we are...

368
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:39,046
that things got so fucked up
with us and... and Mr. Wallace.

369
00:18:39,087 --> 00:18:42,675
W-we got into this thing with
the best intentions. I never...

370
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,639
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I break your concentration?

371
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:51,935
I didn't mean
to do that. Please, continue.

372
00:18:51,977 --> 00:18:56,607
You were saying something
about "best intentions."

373
00:18:56,649 --> 00:19:00,904
What's the matter?
Oh, y-you were finished?

374
00:19:00,946 --> 00:19:03,324
Oh, well, allow me to retort.

375
00:19:07,078 --> 00:19:10,207
What does Marsellus Wallace
look like?

376
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,460
What?

377
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:14,212
What country are you from?

378
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,797
Wh-what?

379
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,381
"What" ain't no country
I ever heard of!

380
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:20,134
- They speak English in "What"?
- Wh-what?

381
00:19:20,176 --> 00:19:21,678
English, motherfucker!
Do you speak it?

382
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,180
Yes!

383
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:24,682
- Then you know what I'm saying.
- Yes!

384
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:28,227
Describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!

385
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:30,020
What? I...

386
00:19:30,062 --> 00:19:32,690
Say "what" again!
Say "what" again!

387
00:19:32,732 --> 00:19:34,859
I dare you!
I double-dare you, motherfucker!

388
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:36,987
Say "what"
one more goddamn time!

389
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:38,822
H-h-he's black.

390
00:19:38,864 --> 00:19:41,325
- Go on!
- He's bald.

391
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:44,036
- Does he look like a bitch?
- What?

392
00:19:44,078 --> 00:19:45,788
Oww! Aah!

393
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:50,794
- Does he look like a bitch?
- No!

394
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:53,047
Then why you try to fuck him
like a bitch, Brett?

395
00:19:53,088 --> 00:19:54,507
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

396
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:56,842
Yes, you did, Brett!

397
00:19:56,884 --> 00:19:59,095
You tried to fuck him.
- No.

398
00:19:59,136 --> 00:20:00,888
Marsellus Wallace
don't like to be fucked...

399
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,059
by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

400
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:05,769
You read the Bible, Brett?

401
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:07,437
Y-yes.

402
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:10,107
Well, there's this
passage I got memorized...

403
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:15,613
sort of fits this occasion.
"Ezekiel" 25:17.

404
00:20:15,613 --> 00:20:20,035
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

405
00:20:20,077 --> 00:20:22,120
"by the inequities
of the selfish...

406
00:20:22,162 --> 00:20:25,040
"and the tyranny of evil men.

407
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:30,005
"Blessed is he who in the name
of charity and good will...

408
00:20:30,046 --> 00:20:33,175
"shepherds the weak through
the Valley of Darkness...

409
00:20:33,217 --> 00:20:35,803
"for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

410
00:20:35,845 --> 00:20:39,015
"and the finder
of lost children.

411
00:20:39,057 --> 00:20:41,852
"And I will strike down
upon thee...

412
00:20:41,894 --> 00:20:45,523
"with great vengeance
and furious anger...

413
00:20:45,565 --> 00:20:50,194
"those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

414
00:20:50,236 --> 00:20:53,949
"And you will know
My name is the Lord...

415
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:57,578
"when I lay My vengeance
upon thee!"

416
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,162
No!

417
00:21:09,884 --> 00:21:11,259
Let's stay together

418
00:21:15,848 --> 00:21:18,268
I think you're gonna find...

419
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:22,731
when all this shit
is over and done...

420
00:21:22,773 --> 00:21:24,316
I think
you're gonna find yourself...

421
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:26,360
one smilin' motherfucker.

422
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:36,163
Thing is, Butch,
right now you got ability.

423
00:21:36,205 --> 00:21:41,710
But painful as it may be,
ability don't last.

424
00:21:43,796 --> 00:21:48,051
And your days
are just about over.

425
00:21:48,093 --> 00:21:52,264
Now, that's a hard
motherfuckin' fact of life...

426
00:21:52,305 --> 00:21:53,765
but that's a fact of life...

427
00:21:53,807 --> 00:21:56,310
your ass is gonna have
to get realistic about.

428
00:21:59,355 --> 00:22:01,733
See, this business
is filled to the brim...

429
00:22:01,775 --> 00:22:05,029
with unrealistic
motherfuckers...

430
00:22:05,071 --> 00:22:08,992
motherfuckers who thought
their ass would age like wine.

431
00:22:10,827 --> 00:22:15,624
If you mean it turns
to vinegar, it does.

432
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:21,339
If you mean it gets better
with age, it don't.

433
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:25,302
Besides, Butch...

434
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:29,097
how many fights you think
you got in you, anyway?

435
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:34,270
Hmm? Two?

436
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:38,984
Boxers don't have
an Old-timer's Day.

437
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:42,988
You came close,
but you never made it.

438
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,615
And if you were
gonna make it...

439
00:22:44,657 --> 00:22:46,659
You would have made it
before now.

440
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:48,369
Good or bad

441
00:22:48,411 --> 00:22:51,331
Or happy or sad

442
00:22:56,378 --> 00:22:58,005
Ooh, ooh, ooh

443
00:22:58,047 --> 00:22:59,840
Ooh, ooooh, ooh

444
00:22:59,882 --> 00:23:01,008
Yeah

445
00:23:03,803 --> 00:23:05,430
You my nigger?

446
00:23:10,811 --> 00:23:12,396
It certainly appears so.

447
00:23:19,737 --> 00:23:23,367
Night of the fight,
you may feel a slight sting.

448
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:31,126
That's pride fucking with you.

449
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:35,506
Fuck pride!

450
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:42,014
Pride only hurts.
It never helps.

451
00:23:42,056 --> 00:23:45,517
You fight through that shit.

452
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:48,020
'Cause a year from now...

453
00:23:48,062 --> 00:23:50,565
when you're kickin' it
in the Caribbean...

454
00:23:50,606 --> 00:23:55,487
you're gonna say to yourself,
"Marsellus Wallace was right."

455
00:23:55,487 --> 00:23:57,155
Ha ha ha.

456
00:23:57,197 --> 00:23:59,491
I got no problem with that,
Mr. Wallace.

457
00:24:01,785 --> 00:24:05,206
In the fifth,
your ass goes down.

458
00:24:09,711 --> 00:24:10,920
Say it.

459
00:24:13,882 --> 00:24:16,218
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

460
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,808
Yo, Vincent Vega,
our man in Amsterdam.

461
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:24,060
Jules Winnfield,
our man in Inglewood.

462
00:24:24,102 --> 00:24:26,730
Get your asses on in here!

463
00:24:26,772 --> 00:24:28,857
Goddamn, nigger!
What's up with them clothes?

464
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:30,401
You don't even want to know.

465
00:24:32,403 --> 00:24:33,863
Where's the big man?

466
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:36,324
Big man's right over there
taking care of some business.

467
00:24:36,324 --> 00:24:38,618
Why don't you hang back
for a second or two, you know?

468
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,371
You see the white boy leave,
just go on over.

469
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:46,211
How you been?

470
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:48,003
I've been doing pretty good.
How 'bout yourself?

471
00:24:48,045 --> 00:24:51,049
All right.

472
00:24:52,467 --> 00:24:54,720
So, I hear you're taking Mia out
tomorrow?

473
00:24:57,682 --> 00:25:00,059
At Marsellus' request.

474
00:25:01,853 --> 00:25:03,313
Have you met Mia?

475
00:25:03,355 --> 00:25:05,316
Not yet.

476
00:25:05,357 --> 00:25:07,860
- What's so fucking funny?
- Not a goddamn thing.

477
00:25:07,902 --> 00:25:10,197
I got to piss.

478
00:25:10,238 --> 00:25:12,574
Look, I'm not a fucking idiot,
all right?

479
00:25:12,616 --> 00:25:15,535
It's the big man's wife.
I'm gonna sit across from her...

480
00:25:15,577 --> 00:25:17,079
chew my food
with my mouth closed...

481
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,873
laugh at her fucking jokes,
and that's it.

482
00:25:18,914 --> 00:25:22,168
Hey, my name's Paul,
and this shit's between y'all.

483
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,796
Then what did you fucking ask me
about it for?

484
00:25:24,838 --> 00:25:26,339
Asshole.

485
00:25:33,681 --> 00:25:35,141
Give me a pack of Red Apples.

486
00:25:35,183 --> 00:25:37,143
Filters?
- Nah.

487
00:25:40,897 --> 00:25:42,524
You looking at something,
friend?

488
00:25:42,566 --> 00:25:44,526
You ain't my friend, palooka.

489
00:25:46,487 --> 00:25:47,947
What was that?

490
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:50,575
I think you heard me just fine,
punchy.

491
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:53,077
Vincent Vega's in the house?

492
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,248
My nigger.
Get your ass over here.

493
00:26:00,002 --> 00:26:04,090
You'd never do that to me

494
00:26:04,132 --> 00:26:07,343
- What's up?
- I'm sorry.

495
00:26:07,385 --> 00:26:09,179
Don't worry about it.

496
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,057
Pack of Red Apples.
$1.40.

497
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,853
And some matches.

498
00:26:16,896 --> 00:26:18,856
Here's what I want to do

499
00:26:18,856 --> 00:26:22,152
Hey

500
00:26:22,193 --> 00:26:23,737
We ought to stay together

501
00:26:23,778 --> 00:26:25,364
It's as if it turns...

502
00:26:25,405 --> 00:26:28,326
every part of your body
into the tip of a penis.

503
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:29,786
Wow.

504
00:26:29,827 --> 00:26:31,454
I'll lend it to you.
It's a great book on piercing.

505
00:26:31,496 --> 00:26:33,415
Well, you see
how they use that gun...

506
00:26:33,457 --> 00:26:34,875
to pierce your ears?

507
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:36,836
They don't use that to pierce
your nipples, too, do they?

508
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:38,046
Forget that gun.

509
00:26:38,087 --> 00:26:40,674
That gun goes against
the entire idea behind piercing.

510
00:26:40,715 --> 00:26:43,593
All my piercing,
eighteen places on my body...

511
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,929
every one of 'em
done with a needle.

512
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:49,183
Five in each ear. One through
the nipple of my left breast.

513
00:26:49,225 --> 00:26:52,395
Two in my right nostril.
One in my left eyebrow.

514
00:26:52,437 --> 00:26:55,190
One in my belly. One in my lip.
One in my clit.

515
00:26:55,231 --> 00:26:57,567
And I wear a stud in my tongue.

516
00:26:57,609 --> 00:26:58,902
Excuse me.

517
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:02,406
I was just curious, but, um...

518
00:27:02,448 --> 00:27:04,867
why would you wear a stud
in your tongue?

519
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:08,412
It's a sex thing.
Helps fellatio.

520
00:27:08,454 --> 00:27:12,500
Vincenzo. Step into my office.

521
00:27:19,384 --> 00:27:20,968
This is Panda,
from Mexico.

522
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:23,471
Very good stuff.
Now, that's Bava.

523
00:27:23,513 --> 00:27:25,265
Different, but equally good.

524
00:27:25,265 --> 00:27:28,769
And that is Choco, from
the Hartz Mountains of Germany.

525
00:27:28,811 --> 00:27:30,563
Now, the first two
are the same...

526
00:27:30,604 --> 00:27:33,732
300 a gram.
Those are friend prices.

527
00:27:33,774 --> 00:27:36,319
But this one
is a little more expensive.

528
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,864
This is 500 a gram,
but when you shoot it...

529
00:27:39,906 --> 00:27:42,034
you will know
where that extra money went.

530
00:27:42,075 --> 00:27:43,577
Now, there's nothing wrong
with these two.

531
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:46,246
This is real, real,
real good shit.

532
00:27:46,288 --> 00:27:49,917
But this one
is a fucking madman.

533
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,420
Remember,
I just got back from Amsterdam.

534
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,130
Am I a nigger?

535
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,510
Are we in Inglewood?
No. You're in my home.

536
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,303
Now, white people
who know the difference...

537
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:02,349
between good shit and bad shit,
this is the house they come to.

538
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,476
Now, my shit,
I'll take the Pepsi Challenge...

539
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:07,521
with that Amsterdam shit
any old day of the fucking week.

540
00:28:07,605 --> 00:28:09,232
That's a bold statement.

541
00:28:09,232 --> 00:28:11,151
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.

542
00:28:11,193 --> 00:28:13,111
This is a seller's market.

543
00:28:13,111 --> 00:28:17,157
Coke is fucking dead as... dead.

544
00:28:17,199 --> 00:28:20,202
Heroin is coming back
in a big fucking way.

545
00:28:22,497 --> 00:28:25,332
All right,
give me three grams of madman.

546
00:28:25,374 --> 00:28:27,251
If it's as good
as you say it is...

547
00:28:27,293 --> 00:28:28,878
I'll come back
and buy another thousand.

548
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,924
Well, I just hope that I still
have some left for you.

549
00:28:31,965 --> 00:28:36,471
But... I'm giving you some
out of my own private stash.

550
00:28:36,512 --> 00:28:38,389
That is what a nice guy I am.

551
00:28:39,807 --> 00:28:42,477
Hey, I'm out of balloons.
Is a baggie all right?

552
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:44,020
Yeah, that's cool.

553
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,814
All right.
I'll just get one for you.

554
00:28:45,856 --> 00:28:48,818
Honey,
will you get me some baggies...

555
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,736
and, uh,
twistix from the kitchen?

556
00:28:50,778 --> 00:28:52,822
OK.

557
00:28:52,863 --> 00:28:54,824
Hey, uh,
what do you think about Trudi?

558
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,284
She ain't got a boyfriend.

559
00:28:56,326 --> 00:28:58,453
You want to, uh,
hang out, get high?

560
00:28:58,537 --> 00:28:59,997
Which one is Trudi?

561
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:01,999
The one with all the shit
in her face.

562
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:06,504
No, that's Jody. That's my wife.

563
00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:10,926
- I'm sorry, man.
- Thank you.

564
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:13,762
No, I can't.
Um, I gotta be someplace.

565
00:29:13,804 --> 00:29:15,264
All right. No problemo.

566
00:29:15,306 --> 00:29:17,057
I'll take a rain check.

567
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:21,604
Oh.
Thank you, Jody.

568
00:29:21,646 --> 00:29:24,775
Still got your Malibu?

569
00:29:24,816 --> 00:29:28,070
Ah, man. You know what some
fucker did the other day?

570
00:29:28,112 --> 00:29:30,114
What?
- Fucking keyed it.

571
00:29:30,156 --> 00:29:33,869
- Oh, man, that's fucked up.
Tell me about it.

572
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:38,166
I had it in storage for 3 years.
It was out 5 days...

573
00:29:38,207 --> 00:29:41,043
and some dickless piece of shit
fucked with it.

574
00:29:41,043 --> 00:29:42,294
They should be
fucking killed, man.

575
00:29:42,336 --> 00:29:44,881
No trial, no jury,
straight to execution.

576
00:29:44,923 --> 00:29:47,467
Boy, I wish
I could've caught him doing it.

577
00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:50,346
I'd have given anything
to catch that asshole doing it.

578
00:29:50,387 --> 00:29:52,265
It'a been worth him
doing it...

579
00:29:52,306 --> 00:29:53,849
just so I could've caught him
doing it.

580
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:56,060
- What a fucker!
- What's more chicken shit...

581
00:29:56,102 --> 00:29:57,645
than fucking
with a man's automobile?

582
00:29:57,645 --> 00:29:59,856
I mean, don't fuck
with another man's vehicle.

583
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,276
- You don't do it.
- It's just against the rules.

584
00:30:02,526 --> 00:30:05,279
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

585
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:07,072
Mind if I shoot up here?

586
00:30:07,114 --> 00:30:08,699
Mi casa, su casa.

587
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:10,368
Muchas gracias.

588
00:32:12,214 --> 00:32:14,048
Hello?

589
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:16,092
Billy Ray was a preacher's son

590
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:18,637
And when his daddy
would visit he'd come along

591
00:32:19,722 --> 00:32:22,308
Vincent.

592
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:27,856
Vincent.
I'm on the intercom.

593
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:30,151
Where is it?
Where is the intercom?

594
00:32:30,151 --> 00:32:33,572
It's on the wall
by the two African fellows.

595
00:32:33,613 --> 00:32:35,282
To your right.

596
00:32:35,324 --> 00:32:37,952
...was the son
of a preacher man

597
00:32:37,993 --> 00:32:39,203
The only boy...

598
00:32:39,245 --> 00:32:44,625
Warm. Warmer. Disco.

599
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:47,963
Hello.

600
00:32:48,004 --> 00:32:50,132
Push the button
if you want to talk.

601
00:32:52,051 --> 00:32:54,678
- Hello.
- Go make yourself a drink...

602
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,306
and I'll be down
in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

603
00:32:58,307 --> 00:32:59,893
The bar is by the fireplace.

604
00:32:59,976 --> 00:33:02,229
Being good isn't always easy

605
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,523
OK.

606
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:07,109
When he started
sweet-talkin' to me

607
00:33:07,192 --> 00:33:09,778
He'd come and tell me
everything is all right

608
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,448
He'd kiss and tell me
everything is all right

609
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,826
Can I get away again tonight?

610
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,454
The only one
who could ever reach me

611
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:20,123
Was the son of a preacher man

612
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,876
The only boy
who could ever teach me

613
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,921
Was the son of a preacher man

614
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:28,675
Yes, he was, he was

615
00:33:28,717 --> 00:33:31,427
- Lord knows he was,
- Ooh, yes, he was

616
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:36,392
How well I remember

617
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:39,020
The look
that was in his eyes

618
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:41,690
Stealin' kisses
from me on the sly

619
00:33:41,731 --> 00:33:44,108
Takin' time to make time

620
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:47,070
Tellin' me that he's all mine

621
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:49,323
Learnin' from
each other's knowin'

622
00:33:49,364 --> 00:33:51,575
Lookin' to see
how much we've grown

623
00:33:51,617 --> 00:33:54,829
And the only one
who could ever reach me

624
00:33:54,871 --> 00:33:57,165
Was the son of a preacher man

625
00:33:57,207 --> 00:33:59,919
The only boy
who could ever teach me

626
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,754
Was the son of a preacher man

627
00:34:01,796 --> 00:34:05,175
Yes, he was, he was

628
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:08,262
Oh, yes, he was

629
00:34:08,304 --> 00:34:10,180
Let's go.

630
00:34:15,478 --> 00:34:17,063
What the fuck is this place?

631
00:34:17,105 --> 00:34:23,069
This is Jack Rabbit Slim's.
An Elvis man should love it.

632
00:34:23,111 --> 00:34:25,072
Come on, Mia,
let's go get a steak.

633
00:34:25,072 --> 00:34:27,658
You can get a steak here,
daddy-o.

634
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,702
Don't be a...

635
00:34:30,912 --> 00:34:33,081
Oh, after you,
kitty cat.

636
00:34:53,604 --> 00:34:55,481
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

637
00:34:55,481 --> 00:34:57,233
Now, how may I help you?

638
00:34:57,275 --> 00:34:59,236
There's a reservation
under Wallace.

639
00:34:59,277 --> 00:35:03,073
- Wallace?
- We reserved a car.

640
00:35:03,114 --> 00:35:07,161
Oh, a car. Why don't you
seat them in the Chrysler?

641
00:35:07,202 --> 00:35:09,038
Throw a nickel in the jukebox

642
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,415
Then we start to rock

643
00:35:10,456 --> 00:35:12,333
School gal, baby,
gonna tell you some news

644
00:35:12,374 --> 00:35:14,460
You sure do look good
in them baby doll shoes

645
00:35:14,502 --> 00:35:17,130
Well, it's one, two,
pull off my shoes

646
00:35:17,172 --> 00:35:19,466
Three, four,
get out on the floor

647
00:35:19,508 --> 00:35:21,260
Five, six, gonna get your kicks

648
00:35:21,302 --> 00:35:24,514
Down at the corner
of Lincoln and 46th, yeah

649
00:35:27,851 --> 00:35:29,854
All right

650
00:35:32,899 --> 00:35:35,318
I've been waitin'
in school all day long

651
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,446
Waitin' on the bell
to ring so I can go home

652
00:35:37,446 --> 00:35:40,073
Throw my books on the table,
Pick up the telephone

653
00:35:40,115 --> 00:35:41,700
Come on, baby,
let's get somethin' goin'

654
00:35:41,742 --> 00:35:43,702
Decaf!
Just a minute.

655
00:35:43,702 --> 00:35:45,955
Throw a nickel in the jukebox

656
00:35:45,997 --> 00:35:47,248
Then we start to rock

657
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,959
School's out baby,
gonna tell you some news

658
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,210
You sure do look good
in them baby doll shoes

659
00:35:51,252 --> 00:35:53,964
Well, it's one, two,
pull off my shoes

660
00:35:54,005 --> 00:35:56,383
Three, four,
get out on the floor

661
00:35:56,383 --> 00:35:58,010
Five, six,
come get your kicks

662
00:35:58,052 --> 00:36:00,430
Down at the corner
of Lincoln and 46th

663
00:36:00,471 --> 00:36:02,808
You gotta move,
start rockin', baby

664
00:36:02,808 --> 00:36:05,226
Rockin', rockin', baby,
gonna rock all night

665
00:36:05,268 --> 00:36:08,564
Rock all night,
just wait and see

666
00:36:08,605 --> 00:36:10,357
Ricky! Ricky!

667
00:36:13,528 --> 00:36:16,405
Let's hear it for Ricky Nelson!

668
00:36:16,447 --> 00:36:18,491
Fantastic job, Rick.
Thank you very much.

669
00:36:18,533 --> 00:36:20,201
Vincent!

670
00:36:23,747 --> 00:36:25,541
Just so that you all know...

671
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:28,169
Ricky will be back
in the second half of our show.

672
00:36:28,211 --> 00:36:32,131
So we hope you enjoy your meals
here at Jack Rabbit Slim's.

673
00:36:32,131 --> 00:36:33,967
Thank you.

674
00:36:34,009 --> 00:36:36,553
Call for...

675
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:41,184
Phillip... Morris!

676
00:36:41,226 --> 00:36:42,685
What do you think?

677
00:36:42,726 --> 00:36:47,482
I think it's like a wax museum
with a pulse.

678
00:36:47,524 --> 00:36:49,484
Hi, I'm Buddy.
What can I get you?

679
00:36:53,906 --> 00:36:55,617
Let's see.
Steak, steak, steak.

680
00:36:55,658 --> 00:36:59,622
Yeah, the Douglas Sirk steak.
I'll have that.

681
00:36:59,663 --> 00:37:01,082
How do you want that cooked?

682
00:37:01,123 --> 00:37:02,583
Burnt to a crisp,
or bloody as hell?

683
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:06,046
Bloody as hell, and oh, yeah,
look at this. Vanilla Coke.

684
00:37:07,714 --> 00:37:09,299
What about you, Peggy Sue?

685
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:19,686
I'll have the Durwood Kirby
burger, bloody, and...

686
00:37:19,727 --> 00:37:21,145
the $5.00 shake.

687
00:37:21,187 --> 00:37:22,480
How do you want that shake?

688
00:37:22,522 --> 00:37:23,982
Martin and Lewis,
or Amos and Andy?

689
00:37:24,024 --> 00:37:25,317
Martin and Lewis.

690
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,154
Did you just order
a $5.00 shake?

691
00:37:28,195 --> 00:37:30,323
Mm-hmm.

692
00:37:30,365 --> 00:37:33,117
That's a shake.
That's milk and ice cream.

693
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:36,162
Last I heard.
- That's $5.00?

694
00:37:36,204 --> 00:37:37,998
You don't put bourbon in it
or nothin'?

695
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:40,501
- No.
- Just checkin'.

696
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:42,587
I'll be right back
with your drinks.

697
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:44,214
...lonesome town

698
00:37:44,255 --> 00:37:49,218
To cry my troubles away...

699
00:37:50,887 --> 00:37:52,681
Could you, um...

700
00:37:52,723 --> 00:37:54,892
roll me one of those, cowboy?

701
00:37:54,934 --> 00:37:57,896
You can have this one, cowgirl.

702
00:37:57,937 --> 00:37:59,939
Thanks.

703
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,358
...with regret

704
00:38:04,361 --> 00:38:06,655
Think nothin' of it.

705
00:38:06,697 --> 00:38:10,576
...lonesome town

706
00:38:10,618 --> 00:38:12,953
I can learn to forget

707
00:38:12,995 --> 00:38:17,333
So... Marsellus said you
just got back from Amsterdam.

708
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:20,045
- Sure did.
How long were you there?

709
00:38:20,087 --> 00:38:23,090
Just over three years.

710
00:38:25,051 --> 00:38:28,472
I go there about once a year
to chill out for a month.

711
00:38:28,513 --> 00:38:32,268
No kiddin'? I didn't know that.

712
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,230
Why would you?

713
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,945
I heard you did a pilot.

714
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:45,241
That was my fifteen minutes.

715
00:38:45,283 --> 00:38:46,909
What was it?

716
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:49,745
It was a show about a team
of female secret agents...

717
00:38:49,787 --> 00:38:51,664
called "Fox Force Five."

718
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:54,292
- What?
"Fox Force Five."

719
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:56,754
Fox, as in we're
a bunch of foxy chicks.

720
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:59,298
Force, as in we're a force
to be reckoned with.

721
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,134
And Five, as in there's one,
two, three, four, five of us.

722
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:04,679
There was a blond one...
Sommerset O'Neal.

723
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,180
She was the leader.

724
00:39:06,222 --> 00:39:09,017
The Japanese Fox
was a kung-fu master.

725
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:12,980
The black girl
was a demolition expert.

726
00:39:13,022 --> 00:39:16,191
French Fox's speciality was sex.

727
00:39:16,191 --> 00:39:17,777
What was your specialty?

728
00:39:17,818 --> 00:39:20,613
Knives.

729
00:39:20,655 --> 00:39:22,449
Character I played,
Raven McCoy...

730
00:39:22,491 --> 00:39:26,662
her background was she grew up
raised by circus performers.

731
00:39:26,704 --> 00:39:28,163
According to the show...

732
00:39:28,205 --> 00:39:30,958
she was the deadliest woman
in the world with a knife...

733
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,837
and she knew
a zillion old jokes.

734
00:39:33,878 --> 00:39:37,758
Her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her.

735
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,926
And if we would've
got picked up...

736
00:39:39,968 --> 00:39:42,429
they would've worked in
a gimmick where every show...

737
00:39:42,471 --> 00:39:45,391
I would've told another joke.

738
00:39:47,435 --> 00:39:49,354
You know any of them old jokes?

739
00:39:49,396 --> 00:39:50,814
Well, I only got the chance
to say one...

740
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:53,192
'cause we only did one show.

741
00:39:53,234 --> 00:39:56,654
- Tell me.
- It's corny.

742
00:39:56,654 --> 00:39:58,532
Don't be that way.
Tell me.

743
00:39:58,573 --> 00:40:01,035
No. You wouldn't like it,
and I'd be embarrassed.

744
00:40:01,076 --> 00:40:02,495
You'd be em...

745
00:40:02,537 --> 00:40:06,540
You told 50 million people,
and you can't tell me?

746
00:40:06,582 --> 00:40:08,543
I promise I won't laugh.

747
00:40:08,584 --> 00:40:10,545
That's what I'm afraid of,
Vince.

748
00:40:10,545 --> 00:40:12,881
That's not what I meant,
and you know it.

749
00:40:12,923 --> 00:40:14,800
Well, now I'm definitely
not gonna tell you...

750
00:40:14,842 --> 00:40:16,385
'cause it's been
built up too much.

751
00:40:16,427 --> 00:40:19,054
What a gyp.

752
00:40:21,224 --> 00:40:22,642
Martin and Lewis.

753
00:40:25,187 --> 00:40:28,065
Vanilla Coke.

754
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:35,740
Mmm. Yummy.

755
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,826
You think
I could have a sip of that?

756
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,498
Be my guest.

757
00:40:42,498 --> 00:40:46,543
I gotta know what a $5.00 shake
tastes like.

758
00:40:46,585 --> 00:40:48,713
You can use my straw.
I don't have cooties.

759
00:40:48,754 --> 00:40:53,135
- Yeah, but maybe I do.
- Cooties, I can handle.

760
00:40:53,176 --> 00:40:55,012
All right.

761
00:41:02,436 --> 00:41:04,981
Goddamn, that's a pretty
fuckin' good milk shake.

762
00:41:05,023 --> 00:41:06,525
Told you.

763
00:41:06,566 --> 00:41:08,068
I don't know
if it was worth $5.00...

764
00:41:08,068 --> 00:41:09,569
but it was pretty fucking good.

765
00:41:43,984 --> 00:41:45,861
Don't you hate that?

766
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,529
Hate what?

767
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:49,949
Uncomfortable silences.

768
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,994
Why do we feel
it's necessary...

769
00:41:53,036 --> 00:41:56,498
to yak about bullshit
in order to be comfortable?

770
00:41:57,541 --> 00:42:01,336
I don't know,
but it's a good question.

771
00:42:01,378 --> 00:42:05,299
That's when you know you've
found somebody really special...

772
00:42:05,341 --> 00:42:07,761
when you can just
shut the fuck up for a minute...

773
00:42:07,802 --> 00:42:10,097
and comfortably share a silence.

774
00:42:10,138 --> 00:42:11,640
Well, I don't think
we're quite there yet...

775
00:42:11,682 --> 00:42:14,267
but don't feel bad.
We just met each other.

776
00:42:15,644 --> 00:42:18,648
I'll tell you what.

777
00:42:18,731 --> 00:42:21,943
I'm going to go to the bathroom
and powder my nose.

778
00:42:21,985 --> 00:42:25,489
You sit here
and think of something to say.

779
00:42:25,531 --> 00:42:27,699
I'll do that.

780
00:42:31,495 --> 00:42:32,955
OK.

781
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:02,114
I said goddamn! Goddamn.

782
00:43:02,156 --> 00:43:04,616
Goddamn.

783
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,079
I need some hair spray.

784
00:43:14,753 --> 00:43:17,798
Mmm. Don't you just love it...

785
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,341
when you come back
from the bathroom...

786
00:43:19,383 --> 00:43:21,135
to find your food
waiting for you?

787
00:43:21,177 --> 00:43:23,638
We're lucky
we got anything at all.

788
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,141
I don't think Buddy Holly's
much of a waiter.

789
00:43:26,183 --> 00:43:28,644
Maybe we should've sat
in Marilyn Monroe's section.

790
00:43:28,727 --> 00:43:30,145
Would you like some coffee?

791
00:43:30,186 --> 00:43:31,688
Which one? There's two Monroes.

792
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:35,526
No, there's not.
That is Marilyn Monroe.

793
00:43:35,568 --> 00:43:39,489
That is Mamie Van Doren.

794
00:43:39,531 --> 00:43:41,200
And I don't see
Jayne Mansfield.

795
00:43:41,241 --> 00:43:43,368
She must have the night off
or somethin'.

796
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:46,830
- Pretty smart.
- Yeah, I got my moments.

797
00:43:46,872 --> 00:43:48,666
So, did you think
of somethin' to say?

798
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:50,793
Actually, I did.

799
00:43:52,712 --> 00:43:54,506
However...

800
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,885
You seem like
a really nice person...

801
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,929
and I don't want to offend you.

802
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:05,477
Ooh. This doesn't sound like
the usual mindless, boring...

803
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:07,687
gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.

804
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,148
That sounds like you actually
have somethin' to say.

805
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:12,901
Well, well, I do.
I do.

806
00:44:14,403 --> 00:44:16,572
But you have to promise
not to be offended.

807
00:44:16,614 --> 00:44:18,032
No! No, no, no.

808
00:44:18,074 --> 00:44:20,368
You can't promise
somethin' like that.

809
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:21,870
I have no idea
what you're gonna ask me...

810
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:24,039
so you can go ahead and ask me
what you're gonna ask me...

811
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:27,126
and my natural response
could be to get offended.

812
00:44:27,168 --> 00:44:28,670
Then,
through no fault of my own...

813
00:44:28,712 --> 00:44:31,256
- I would've broken my promise.
- Let's just forget it.

814
00:44:31,298 --> 00:44:32,842
That's an impossibility.

815
00:44:32,925 --> 00:44:34,843
Trying to forget anything
as intriguing as this...

816
00:44:34,885 --> 00:44:36,512
would be an exercise
in futility.

817
00:44:36,512 --> 00:44:37,972
Is that a fact?

818
00:44:38,013 --> 00:44:40,975
Besides,
isn't it more exciting...

819
00:44:40,975 --> 00:44:43,895
- when you don't have permission?
All right. All right.

820
00:44:43,937 --> 00:44:46,856
Well, here it goes.

821
00:44:46,898 --> 00:44:49,818
What did you, uh, think about
what happened to Antwan?

822
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,986
Who's Antwan?

823
00:44:51,028 --> 00:44:53,322
Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.

824
00:44:53,364 --> 00:44:54,949
He fell out of a window.

825
00:44:54,991 --> 00:44:58,412
Mmm. Mmm.
Well, that is one way to say it.

826
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,122
Another way to say it
would be that he was thrown out.

827
00:45:01,164 --> 00:45:04,668
Another way would be was he was
thrown out by Marsellus...

828
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:06,671
and yet even another way
is to say...

829
00:45:06,754 --> 00:45:09,841
he was thrown of a window
by Marsellus because of you.

830
00:45:09,883 --> 00:45:12,343
Is that a fact?

831
00:45:12,385 --> 00:45:14,346
No, no. It's not a fact.
It's just what I heard.

832
00:45:14,387 --> 00:45:17,266
- It's just what I heard.
- Who told you?

833
00:45:17,307 --> 00:45:19,185
They.

834
00:45:19,226 --> 00:45:21,020
They talk a lot, don't they?

835
00:45:23,231 --> 00:45:25,942
They certainly do.
They certainly do.

836
00:45:25,983 --> 00:45:27,944
Don't be shy, Vincent.
What else did they say?

837
00:45:27,986 --> 00:45:30,823
Well, I'm not... I'm not shy.
Um...

838
00:45:30,864 --> 00:45:33,034
Did it involve the "F" word?

839
00:45:33,075 --> 00:45:34,494
No. No, no, no.

840
00:45:34,535 --> 00:45:37,079
They just said that Antwan
had given you a foot massage.

841
00:45:38,706 --> 00:45:42,210
- And?
- And... and nothin'. That's it.

842
00:45:44,171 --> 00:45:47,675
You heard Marsellus
threw Tony Rocky Horror...

843
00:45:47,717 --> 00:45:49,886
out of a four-story window
for giving me a foot massage?

844
00:45:49,928 --> 00:45:52,681
Mm-hmm.
- And you believe that?

845
00:45:52,723 --> 00:45:55,017
Well, I mean...

846
00:45:55,059 --> 00:45:57,353
at the time I was told,
it sounded reasonable.

847
00:45:57,395 --> 00:46:00,190
Marsellus throwing Tony
out of a four-story window...

848
00:46:00,232 --> 00:46:02,901
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?

849
00:46:02,942 --> 00:46:04,402
No, it seemed excessive...

850
00:46:04,402 --> 00:46:07,364
but that doesn't mean it didn't
happen. I mean, I understand...

851
00:46:07,406 --> 00:46:09,867
that Marsellus is very,
very protective of you.

852
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:14,164
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

853
00:46:14,164 --> 00:46:15,999
A husband
almost killing another man...

854
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,376
for touching his wife's feet
is something else.

855
00:46:18,418 --> 00:46:20,295
But did it happen?

856
00:46:20,337 --> 00:46:22,089
Only thing Antwan
ever touched of mine...

857
00:46:22,131 --> 00:46:26,970
was my hand when he shook it...
at my wedding.

858
00:46:27,012 --> 00:46:28,471
Really?

859
00:46:28,513 --> 00:46:30,473
Truth is,
nobody knows why Marsellus...

860
00:46:30,515 --> 00:46:32,058
threw Tony out of
that four-story window...

861
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,311
except Marsellus and Tony.

862
00:46:34,353 --> 00:46:36,397
But when you little scamps
get together...

863
00:46:36,439 --> 00:46:38,024
you're worse
than a sewing circle.

864
00:46:38,066 --> 00:46:40,360
Ladies and gentlemen...

865
00:46:40,402 --> 00:46:42,904
now the moment
you've all been waiting for...

866
00:46:42,945 --> 00:46:48,077
the world-famous Jack Rabbit
Slim's Twist Contest.

867
00:46:51,623 --> 00:46:54,709
This is where
one lucky couple...

868
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:58,964
will win this handsome trophy
that Marilyn here is holding.

869
00:46:58,964 --> 00:47:02,927
Now, who'll be
our first contestants?

870
00:47:02,968 --> 00:47:04,428
Right here!

871
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:06,847
Hey, all right!
- I wanna dance.

872
00:47:06,889 --> 00:47:08,516
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

873
00:47:08,557 --> 00:47:10,476
No, no, no, no, no, no.

874
00:47:10,518 --> 00:47:13,271
I do believe Marsellus...
my husband, your boss...

875
00:47:13,313 --> 00:47:16,025
told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.

876
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:18,736
Now I want to dance.
I want to win.

877
00:47:18,778 --> 00:47:21,698
I want that trophy,
so dance good.

878
00:47:21,698 --> 00:47:23,200
All right. You asked for it.

879
00:47:23,283 --> 00:47:24,785
Let's hear it
for our first contestants.

880
00:47:30,792 --> 00:47:33,711
Let's meet our first
contestants here this evening.

881
00:47:33,753 --> 00:47:35,964
Young lady, what is your name?

882
00:47:36,006 --> 00:47:37,925
Mrs. Mia Wallace.

883
00:47:37,967 --> 00:47:40,970
And how about your fella here?

884
00:47:41,054 --> 00:47:42,472
Vincent Vega.

885
00:47:42,514 --> 00:47:45,308
All right. Let's see
what you can do. Take it away!

886
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:47,477
Yay!
Go for it!

887
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:49,104
All right!

888
00:48:07,375 --> 00:48:09,043
It was a teenage wedding

889
00:48:09,085 --> 00:48:11,379
And the old folks
wished 'em well

890
00:48:13,256 --> 00:48:14,966
You could see that Pierre

891
00:48:15,008 --> 00:48:17,511
Did truly love the mademoiselle

892
00:48:19,555 --> 00:48:21,724
And now the young
monsieur and Madame

893
00:48:21,766 --> 00:48:23,767
Have rung the chapel bell

894
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:27,522
"C'est la vie,"
say the old folks

895
00:48:27,564 --> 00:48:29,858
It goes to show
you never can tell

896
00:48:31,735 --> 00:48:33,404
They furnished off
an apartment

897
00:48:33,446 --> 00:48:36,114
With a two-room Roebuck sale

898
00:48:37,741 --> 00:48:39,452
The coolerator was crammed

899
00:48:39,493 --> 00:48:42,080
With TV dinners and ginger ale

900
00:48:43,832 --> 00:48:45,375
But when Pierre found work

901
00:48:45,459 --> 00:48:47,712
The little money comin'
worked out well

902
00:48:49,964 --> 00:48:51,842
"C'est la vie,"
say the old folks

903
00:48:51,883 --> 00:48:54,303
It goes to show
you never can tell

904
00:48:55,888 --> 00:48:57,974
They had a hi-fi phono

905
00:48:58,016 --> 00:49:00,185
Boy, did they let it blast

906
00:49:02,228 --> 00:49:04,105
700 little records

907
00:49:04,105 --> 00:49:06,525
All rock, rhythm, and jazz

908
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,862
But when the sun went down

909
00:49:09,904 --> 00:49:12,449
The rapid tempo
of the music fell

910
00:49:14,408 --> 00:49:16,369
"C'est la vie,"
say the old folks

911
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:18,622
It goes to show
you never can tell

912
00:49:44,984 --> 00:49:46,736
They had a teenage wedding

913
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:49,615
And the old folks
wished 'em well

914
00:49:51,117 --> 00:49:52,701
You could see that Pierre

915
00:49:52,743 --> 00:49:55,371
Did truly love
the mademoiselle

916
00:50:18,689 --> 00:50:20,316
Ha ha ha!

917
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,289
Is that what you call
an uncomfortable silence?

918
00:50:33,331 --> 00:50:36,585
I don't know what you call that.

919
00:50:38,295 --> 00:50:40,423
Drinks. Music.

920
00:50:40,464 --> 00:50:42,091
I'm gonna take a piss.

921
00:50:43,384 --> 00:50:45,344
That's a little bit
more information...

922
00:50:45,386 --> 00:50:47,972
than I needed, Vince,
but go right ahead.

923
00:51:00,611 --> 00:51:02,364
Girl

924
00:51:02,405 --> 00:51:04,533
Bow, bow, bow

925
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:08,703
You'll be a woman soon

926
00:51:12,041 --> 00:51:14,168
I love you so much,
can't count all the ways

927
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:17,172
I'd die for you, girl,
and all they can say is

928
00:51:17,214 --> 00:51:19,133
He's not your kind

929
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,678
They never get tired
of puttin' me down

930
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:25,389
And I never know
when I come around

931
00:51:25,431 --> 00:51:27,892
What I'm gonna find

932
00:51:27,976 --> 00:51:31,980
Don't let them
make up your mind

933
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:34,315
Don't you know, girl

934
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:36,401
Bow, bow, bow

935
00:51:36,401 --> 00:51:40,281
You'll be a woman soon

936
00:51:40,323 --> 00:51:43,076
One drink and that's it.

937
00:51:43,118 --> 00:51:45,746
Don't be rude.
Drink your drink.

938
00:51:45,787 --> 00:51:47,289
But do it quickly.

939
00:51:48,749 --> 00:51:51,461
Say good night and go home.

940
00:51:51,503 --> 00:51:53,505
Girl

941
00:51:53,547 --> 00:51:58,010
You'll be a woman soon

942
00:51:59,012 --> 00:52:02,056
Soon

943
00:52:02,098 --> 00:52:05,810
You'll need a woman

944
00:52:07,521 --> 00:52:09,356
I've been misunderstood
for all of my life

945
00:52:09,398 --> 00:52:12,651
But what they're sayin', girl,
just cuts like a knife

946
00:52:12,693 --> 00:52:15,529
The boy's no good

947
00:52:15,571 --> 00:52:17,740
Well, I finally have found
what I've been lookin' for

948
00:52:17,782 --> 00:52:20,285
But if they get a chance,
they'll end it for sure

949
00:52:20,327 --> 00:52:23,080
Sure they would

950
00:52:23,122 --> 00:52:26,583
Baby, I've done...

951
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:29,837
You see, this is a moral test
of oneself.

952
00:52:29,879 --> 00:52:32,757
Whether or not
you can maintain loyalty.

953
00:52:32,799 --> 00:52:36,553
Because being loyal
is very important.

954
00:52:36,595 --> 00:52:38,263
They never
get tired of puttin' me down

955
00:52:38,305 --> 00:52:41,225
And I never know
when I come around

956
00:52:41,266 --> 00:52:43,477
What I'm gonna find

957
00:52:43,519 --> 00:52:48,025
Don't let them
make up your mind

958
00:52:48,066 --> 00:52:50,318
Don't you know, girl

959
00:52:52,279 --> 00:52:56,867
You'll be a woman soon

960
00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:59,245
Please

961
00:53:00,747 --> 00:53:03,917
Come take my hand

962
00:53:06,336 --> 00:53:07,504
Girl

963
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:13,511
You'll be a woman soon

964
00:53:14,763 --> 00:53:16,098
Please

965
00:53:17,808 --> 00:53:20,853
Come take my hand

966
00:53:22,564 --> 00:53:24,024
Hello.

967
00:53:24,066 --> 00:53:26,151
Girl

968
00:53:26,193 --> 00:53:29,196
So, you're gonna go out there,
you're gonna say...

969
00:53:29,237 --> 00:53:31,490
"Good night.
I've had a very lovely evening."

970
00:53:32,825 --> 00:53:35,036
Walk out the door
and get in the car.

971
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:37,956
Go home, jerk off,
and that's all you're gonna do.

972
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:45,130
Now it's up to you, girl

973
00:53:47,175 --> 00:53:51,305
You'll be a woman soon

974
00:53:52,556 --> 00:53:53,890
Please

975
00:53:55,767 --> 00:53:58,938
Come take my hand

976
00:54:04,569 --> 00:54:08,365
You'll be a woman soon

977
00:54:09,574 --> 00:54:11,076
Soon

978
00:54:12,787 --> 00:54:16,624
You'll need a man

979
00:54:25,551 --> 00:54:29,973
All right, Mia.
So, listen, I gotta go.

980
00:54:30,014 --> 00:54:31,892
All right?

981
00:54:34,185 --> 00:54:37,648
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

982
00:54:37,689 --> 00:54:42,820
You f... Oh, Jesus Christ.
Oh, fuck me! Fuck me!

983
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:45,449
Oh, come on, girl.
We're gettin' out of here.

984
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,660
We gotta walk now.

985
00:54:57,463 --> 00:55:00,674
Don't fucking die on me, Mia.

986
00:55:00,716 --> 00:55:02,218
Silly fuck.

987
00:55:10,602 --> 00:55:11,686
Answer!

988
00:55:12,896 --> 00:55:14,481
Have you got the ring?

989
00:55:14,523 --> 00:55:15,649
Why, certainly.

990
00:55:15,691 --> 00:55:16,943
Join hands,
you two love birds.

991
00:55:16,984 --> 00:55:18,111
Uh-uh.

992
00:55:18,111 --> 00:55:20,071
Please. Please.
Hurry up.

993
00:55:20,071 --> 00:55:21,364
Yes, yes, yes, indeed.

994
00:55:21,406 --> 00:55:23,324
Hold hands, you love birds.

995
00:55:29,707 --> 00:55:31,751
Fuck you, Lance! Answer!

996
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,301
Now, what do you say?

997
00:55:39,301 --> 00:55:41,845
I give up,
I'll marry you!

998
00:55:43,931 --> 00:55:46,684
Lance!
The goddamn phone's ringing!

999
00:55:48,395 --> 00:55:49,812
I can hear it.

1000
00:55:49,854 --> 00:55:51,564
I thought you told
those fuckin' assholes...

1001
00:55:51,606 --> 00:55:53,316
never to call here this late.

1002
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:54,735
Yeah, I told 'em...

1003
00:55:54,776 --> 00:55:56,946
and that is exactly
what I'm going to tell...

1004
00:55:56,987 --> 00:55:58,614
this fucking asshole right now.

1005
00:55:58,656 --> 00:56:01,117
I'll teach you a thing or two.

1006
00:56:01,159 --> 00:56:02,326
Don't you dare strike me!

1007
00:56:02,368 --> 00:56:03,327
Hello?

1008
00:56:03,369 --> 00:56:04,954
Lance, Vincent.

1009
00:56:04,996 --> 00:56:06,998
I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man.

1010
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,667
I'm comin' to your house.

1011
00:56:08,709 --> 00:56:11,295
Whoa, whoa.
Hold your horses, man.

1012
00:56:11,337 --> 00:56:12,797
Wh-what's the problem?

1013
00:56:12,839 --> 00:56:15,050
I got this chick,
she's fuckin' Odin on me.

1014
00:56:15,091 --> 00:56:16,176
Don't bring her here.

1015
00:56:16,218 --> 00:56:18,220
I'm not even fucking
joking with you, man.

1016
00:56:18,262 --> 00:56:20,515
Don't not be bringing some
fucked-up pooh-butt to my house.

1017
00:56:20,556 --> 00:56:21,516
No choice.

1018
00:56:21,557 --> 00:56:22,684
She's O.D. In'?

1019
00:56:22,726 --> 00:56:24,728
She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!

1020
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:27,772
OK, well, then you bite
the fuckin' bullet...

1021
00:56:27,814 --> 00:56:30,150
and you take her to a hospital
and call a lawyer.

1022
00:56:30,192 --> 00:56:31,193
Negative.

1023
00:56:31,193 --> 00:56:32,820
This is not
my fuckin' problem, man!

1024
00:56:32,862 --> 00:56:36,658
You fucked her up,
you fuckin' deal with this!

1025
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,911
Are you talking to me
on a cellular phone?

1026
00:56:39,952 --> 00:56:41,329
I don't know you.
Who is this?

1027
00:56:41,371 --> 00:56:42,789
Don't come here.
I'm hanging up the phone.

1028
00:56:42,831 --> 00:56:44,124
Prank caller! Prank caller!

1029
00:56:54,636 --> 00:56:56,680
What the hell was that?!

1030
00:56:57,723 --> 00:56:59,683
Have you lost
your fucking mind?!

1031
00:56:59,725 --> 00:57:02,061
You were talking about drug shit
on a cellular ph...

1032
00:57:02,103 --> 00:57:03,104
Lance, help me.

1033
00:57:03,146 --> 00:57:04,564
You crashed your car
into my fuckin' house!

1034
00:57:04,606 --> 00:57:05,564
Grab her feet.

1035
00:57:05,606 --> 00:57:07,400
Hey, hey, hey!
Are you deaf?

1036
00:57:07,442 --> 00:57:10,237
You are not bringing this
fucked-up bitch into my house!

1037
00:57:10,278 --> 00:57:12,364
This fucked-up bitch
is Marsellus Wallace's wife.

1038
00:57:12,406 --> 00:57:14,492
Do you know
who Marsellus Wallace is?

1039
00:57:14,533 --> 00:57:15,576
Yeah.

1040
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,828
If she croaks on me,
I'm a fucking grease spot!

1041
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:21,875
I will be forced to tell him
that you did not help...

1042
00:57:21,916 --> 00:57:24,086
and that you let her die
on your fuckin' lawn.

1043
00:57:24,086 --> 00:57:27,339
Now, come on, help me.
Help me. Pick her up.

1044
00:57:27,381 --> 00:57:28,549
Shit!

1045
00:57:31,552 --> 00:57:34,138
Lance!

1046
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,515
Shit!

1047
00:57:35,557 --> 00:57:38,143
It's 1:30
in the goddamn morning.

1048
00:57:38,185 --> 00:57:40,396
What the fuck's
going on out here?

1049
00:57:40,437 --> 00:57:42,189
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

1050
00:57:42,231 --> 00:57:43,775
Who's she?

1051
00:57:43,816 --> 00:57:46,486
Go to the fridge
and get the adrenaline shot.

1052
00:57:46,528 --> 00:57:47,780
What's wrong with her?

1053
00:57:47,821 --> 00:57:50,074
- She's O.D.ing!
- Get her out of here!

1054
00:57:50,116 --> 00:57:51,325
Get the shot!

1055
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:53,370
Fuck you!
Fuck you, too!

1056
00:57:53,411 --> 00:57:54,871
What a fuckin' bitch.

1057
00:57:54,913 --> 00:57:56,247
Just keep talkin' to her.

1058
00:57:56,289 --> 00:57:57,290
She's gettin' the shot.

1059
00:57:57,332 --> 00:57:59,000
I'm gonna go get
my little black medical book.

1060
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:00,544
What the fuck you need
a medical book for?

1061
00:58:00,585 --> 00:58:02,671
I never had to give
an adrenaline shot before.

1062
00:58:02,713 --> 00:58:03,673
You've never given
an adrenaline shot?

1063
00:58:03,714 --> 00:58:04,924
I never had to.

1064
00:58:04,966 --> 00:58:06,175
I don't go joypopping
with a bunch of bubblegummers.

1065
00:58:06,217 --> 00:58:07,260
My friends
can handle their highs.

1066
00:58:07,302 --> 00:58:09,387
- Get the shot!
- I am if you'll let me.

1067
00:58:09,428 --> 00:58:10,722
I ain't fucking stopping you!

1068
00:58:10,763 --> 00:58:12,265
Well, stop talkin' to me.
Start talkin' to her!

1069
00:58:12,307 --> 00:58:13,767
- Get the shot!
- All right!

1070
00:58:17,813 --> 00:58:19,649
Hurry up, Lance!
We're losin' her!

1071
00:58:19,691 --> 00:58:21,318
I'm lookin' as fast as I can!

1072
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:23,069
What's he lookin' for?

1073
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:24,946
I don't know. Some book.

1074
00:58:24,988 --> 00:58:26,406
What are you lookin' for?

1075
00:58:26,448 --> 00:58:27,908
My little black medical book!

1076
00:58:27,908 --> 00:58:29,243
What are you lookin' for?

1077
00:58:29,284 --> 00:58:30,828
A little black
fuckin' medical book!

1078
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:33,706
It's like a textbook
they give to nurses.

1079
00:58:33,748 --> 00:58:35,374
I never saw no medical book.

1080
00:58:35,416 --> 00:58:36,709
Well, trust me, I have one.

1081
00:58:36,751 --> 00:58:39,087
If it's so important, why don't
you keep it with the shot?

1082
00:58:39,129 --> 00:58:40,755
I don't know!
Stop bothering me!

1083
00:58:40,797 --> 00:58:43,342
While you're lookin' for it,
she's gonna die on our carpet.

1084
00:58:43,384 --> 00:58:44,677
You're never gonna find anything
in this mess.

1085
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:47,554
Honey, I'm going to fucking
kill you if you don't shut up!

1086
00:58:47,596 --> 00:58:49,640
Get in here!

1087
00:58:49,682 --> 00:58:50,933
Christ.

1088
00:58:50,975 --> 00:58:52,727
Get the fuck out of my way.

1089
00:58:52,769 --> 00:58:53,853
Pig.

1090
00:58:53,895 --> 00:58:56,148
Quit fuckin' around
and give her the shot.

1091
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:57,316
While I'm doin' this...

1092
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:00,193
you take off her shirt
and find her heart.

1093
00:59:00,235 --> 00:59:02,446
It's got to be exact?
Yeah, exact.

1094
00:59:02,488 --> 00:59:04,448
A shot in the heart,
so I guess it's gotta be exact.

1095
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:07,077
I don't know exactly where
her heart is. I think it's here.

1096
00:59:07,118 --> 00:59:08,620
- That's it.
- This it?

1097
00:59:08,662 --> 00:59:11,582
What I need
is a big fat magic marker.

1098
00:59:11,624 --> 00:59:13,126
- You got it?
- What?

1099
00:59:13,209 --> 00:59:18,006
A magic marker! A felt pen!
A fuckin' black magic marker!

1100
00:59:18,048 --> 00:59:19,925
All right.
Hurry up.

1101
00:59:19,967 --> 00:59:23,805
Fuck. OK, OK, OK.
I think it's ready.

1102
00:59:26,432 --> 00:59:29,436
- Hurry up, man. Hurry up.
- I'll tell you what to do.

1103
00:59:29,477 --> 00:59:31,438
No, no, no.
You're gonna give her the shot.

1104
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,982
- You're gonna give her the shot.
- I ain't givin' her the shot.

1105
00:59:32,982 --> 00:59:34,442
- I ain't givin' her the shot.
- I never done this before.

1106
00:59:34,483 --> 00:59:36,444
I ain't never done it before,
either. I ain't startin' now.

1107
00:59:36,527 --> 00:59:38,612
You brought her here, that means
you're gonna give her the shot.

1108
00:59:38,654 --> 00:59:40,031
The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch
to your house...

1109
00:59:40,072 --> 00:59:41,824
then I give her the shot.
Give her the shot.

1110
00:59:41,866 --> 00:59:42,951
- Give it to me.
- Here.

1111
00:59:42,993 --> 00:59:43,994
Give me that.

1112
00:59:45,579 --> 00:59:47,164
Tell me what to do.

1113
00:59:47,206 --> 00:59:50,043
OK. You're giving her
an injection of adrenaline...

1114
00:59:50,084 --> 00:59:51,752
straight to her heart,
but she's got a breastplate.

1115
00:59:51,794 --> 00:59:53,045
You've got to
pierce through that.

1116
00:59:53,087 --> 00:59:56,299
You gotta bring the needle down
in a stabbing motion.

1117
00:59:56,341 --> 00:59:58,010
I gotta stab her three times?

1118
00:59:58,051 --> 00:59:59,887
No! You don't gotta stab her
three times. Just once.

1119
00:59:59,928 --> 01:00:02,431
But hard enough to get through
her breastplate into her heart.

1120
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:05,476
Once you do that,
you press down on the plunger.

1121
01:00:05,517 --> 01:00:07,645
OK, then what happens?

1122
01:00:07,728 --> 01:00:09,022
I'm kind of curious
about that myself.

1123
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:10,231
This ain't no fuckin' joke, man!

1124
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,692
- Am I gonna kill her?
- No, no!

1125
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,819
She's supposed to come
out of it like that.

1126
01:00:13,861 --> 01:00:16,113
All right. Count to three.
Ready?

1127
01:00:16,155 --> 01:00:17,406
One...

1128
01:00:22,662 --> 01:00:24,247
two...

1129
01:00:33,257 --> 01:00:34,216
Three!

1130
01:00:35,343 --> 01:00:37,804
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1131
01:00:48,817 --> 01:00:52,071
If you're all right,
then say something.

1132
01:00:52,071 --> 01:00:55,074
Something.

1133
01:00:55,115 --> 01:00:58,536
Ha ha. That was fuckin' trippy.
Ha ha ha ha.

1134
01:00:58,578 --> 01:01:00,872
Uhh.

1135
01:01:00,872 --> 01:01:03,000
Oh, man.

1136
01:01:27,694 --> 01:01:29,655
Mia. Mia.

1137
01:01:31,782 --> 01:01:32,949
What's...

1138
01:01:34,827 --> 01:01:37,204
what's your thoughts on... on...

1139
01:01:37,204 --> 01:01:39,791
on how to handle this?

1140
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:41,251
What's yours?

1141
01:01:44,338 --> 01:01:46,631
Well, I'm of the opinion...

1142
01:01:46,673 --> 01:01:48,842
that if Marsellus
lived his whole life...

1143
01:01:48,884 --> 01:01:52,221
he don't need to know nothin'
about this incident.

1144
01:01:52,263 --> 01:01:54,891
If Marsellus knew
about this incident...

1145
01:01:54,933 --> 01:01:57,352
I'd be in as much trouble
as you.

1146
01:01:57,394 --> 01:01:59,896
I seriously doubt that.

1147
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:02,649
I can keep a secret if you can.

1148
01:02:04,819 --> 01:02:06,279
Shake on it?

1149
01:02:12,077 --> 01:02:14,080
Mum's the word?

1150
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:16,416
Cool.

1151
01:02:16,458 --> 01:02:18,001
Now, if you'll excuse me...

1152
01:02:18,043 --> 01:02:19,878
I'm gonna go home
and have a heart attack.

1153
01:02:23,299 --> 01:02:24,508
Vincent!

1154
01:02:27,345 --> 01:02:30,390
Do you want to hear
my "Fox Force Five" joke?

1155
01:02:31,725 --> 01:02:32,976
Sure.

1156
01:02:33,018 --> 01:02:36,605
Except that I think I'm still
a little too petrified to laugh.

1157
01:02:36,646 --> 01:02:39,316
No, you won't laugh
'cause it's not funny.

1158
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:41,903
But if you still wanna hear it,
I'll tell it.

1159
01:02:41,944 --> 01:02:44,114
I can't wait.

1160
01:02:44,155 --> 01:02:45,198
OK.

1161
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,618
Three tomatoes are walking
down the street...

1162
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:50,120
Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato,
and Baby Tomato.

1163
01:02:50,162 --> 01:02:52,081
Baby Tomato
starts lagging behind...

1164
01:02:52,122 --> 01:02:55,126
and Papa Tomato
gets really angry...

1165
01:02:55,126 --> 01:02:59,047
goes back and squishes him,
and says, "Catch up."

1166
01:03:00,048 --> 01:03:02,801
Hmm. Hmm.

1167
01:03:02,842 --> 01:03:03,969
Ketchup.

1168
01:03:08,975 --> 01:03:10,560
See you around.

1169
01:03:32,376 --> 01:03:35,838
Oh, that Paddlefoot...
he funny, silly dog.

1170
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:39,551
He think totem pole alive.
Hee hee hee!

1171
01:03:39,593 --> 01:03:41,679
He arctic tenderfoot.

1172
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,347
Ho ho ho ho!

1173
01:03:43,389 --> 01:03:46,309
That totem pole
been here forever.

1174
01:03:46,351 --> 01:03:47,352
Butch?

1175
01:03:50,356 --> 01:03:52,149
Butch,
stop watching TV a second.

1176
01:03:52,191 --> 01:03:53,400
Yeah?

1177
01:03:53,442 --> 01:03:55,736
We got a special visitor.

1178
01:03:58,906 --> 01:04:01,576
Now... do you
remember when I told you...

1179
01:04:01,618 --> 01:04:04,747
your daddy died
in a P.O.W. Camp?

1180
01:04:04,788 --> 01:04:08,709
Well... this here
is Captain Koons.

1181
01:04:08,751 --> 01:04:11,420
He was in the P.O.W. Camp
with Daddy.

1182
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:18,845
Hello, little man.

1183
01:04:18,887 --> 01:04:22,933
Boy, I sure heard
a bunch about you.

1184
01:04:22,975 --> 01:04:26,312
See, I was a good friend
of your dad's.

1185
01:04:26,354 --> 01:04:29,691
We were in that Hanoi
pit of hell together...

1186
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:32,110
over five years.

1187
01:04:32,152 --> 01:04:34,070
Hopefully...

1188
01:04:34,112 --> 01:04:36,657
you'll never have to experience
this yourself...

1189
01:04:36,699 --> 01:04:39,160
but when two men
are in a situation...

1190
01:04:39,202 --> 01:04:43,540
like me and your dad were
for as long as we were...

1191
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:47,127
you take on certain
responsibilities of the other.

1192
01:04:47,168 --> 01:04:49,630
If it had been me who'd...

1193
01:04:51,257 --> 01:04:52,842
not made it...

1194
01:04:52,884 --> 01:04:57,263
Major Coolidge would be talkin'
right now to my son... Jim.

1195
01:04:57,305 --> 01:04:59,641
But the way
it turned out...

1196
01:04:59,682 --> 01:05:01,143
I'm talkin' to you...

1197
01:05:02,519 --> 01:05:03,938
Butch.

1198
01:05:05,898 --> 01:05:07,567
I got somethin' for ya.

1199
01:05:14,367 --> 01:05:16,619
This watch I got here...

1200
01:05:16,661 --> 01:05:18,872
was first purchased
by your great-grandfather...

1201
01:05:18,914 --> 01:05:21,208
during the First World War.

1202
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,585
It was bought
in a little general store...

1203
01:05:23,585 --> 01:05:25,921
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

1204
01:05:25,963 --> 01:05:29,634
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

1205
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:32,846
Up till then, people just
carried pocket watches.

1206
01:05:32,888 --> 01:05:36,182
It was bought by Private
Doughboy Erine Coolidge...

1207
01:05:36,224 --> 01:05:38,852
on the day he set sail
for Paris.

1208
01:05:38,894 --> 01:05:41,063
This was your great-
grandfather's war watch...

1209
01:05:41,105 --> 01:05:43,608
and he wore it every day
he was in that war.

1210
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:46,028
And when he'd done his duty...

1211
01:05:46,069 --> 01:05:48,279
he went home
to your great-grandmother...

1212
01:05:48,321 --> 01:05:49,614
took the watch off...

1213
01:05:49,656 --> 01:05:51,617
put it in an old coffee can...

1214
01:05:51,658 --> 01:05:52,910
and in that can it stayed...

1215
01:05:52,951 --> 01:05:55,746
Till your granddad,
Dane Coolidge...

1216
01:05:55,788 --> 01:05:57,332
was called upon
by his country...

1217
01:05:57,373 --> 01:06:01,252
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

1218
01:06:01,294 --> 01:06:04,923
This time they called it
World War II.

1219
01:06:04,965 --> 01:06:06,550
Your great-grandfather
gave this watch...

1220
01:06:06,592 --> 01:06:10,054
to your granddad for good luck.

1221
01:06:10,054 --> 01:06:13,099
Unfortunately, Dane's luck
wasn't as good as his old man's.

1222
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:15,727
Dane was a marine,
and he was killed...

1223
01:06:15,768 --> 01:06:19,648
along with all the other marines
at the Battle of Wake Island.

1224
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:23,069
Your granddad was facing death.

1225
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:25,029
He knew it.

1226
01:06:25,071 --> 01:06:26,739
None of those boys
had any illusions...

1227
01:06:26,781 --> 01:06:29,242
about ever leaving
that island alive...

1228
01:06:29,284 --> 01:06:32,371
so, three days before
the Japanese took the island...

1229
01:06:32,412 --> 01:06:35,499
your granddad asked a gunner
on an Air Force transport...

1230
01:06:35,541 --> 01:06:37,961
name of Winocki...

1231
01:06:38,002 --> 01:06:40,505
a man he had never met
before in his life...

1232
01:06:40,547 --> 01:06:43,801
to deliver to his infant son...

1233
01:06:43,843 --> 01:06:45,928
who he had never seen
in the flesh...

1234
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:48,515
his gold watch.

1235
01:06:48,557 --> 01:06:50,684
Three days later,
your granddad was dead...

1236
01:06:50,726 --> 01:06:52,727
but Winocki kept his word.

1237
01:06:52,769 --> 01:06:54,730
After the war was over...

1238
01:06:54,771 --> 01:06:57,191
he paid a visit
to your grandmother...

1239
01:06:57,233 --> 01:06:59,444
delivering
to your infant father...

1240
01:06:59,485 --> 01:07:01,363
his dad's gold watch.

1241
01:07:01,404 --> 01:07:03,156
This watch.

1242
01:07:09,288 --> 01:07:11,582
This watch
was on your daddy's wrist...

1243
01:07:11,624 --> 01:07:14,711
when he was shot down
over Hanoi.

1244
01:07:14,753 --> 01:07:18,256
He was captured,
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

1245
01:07:18,297 --> 01:07:22,386
He knew that if the gooks
ever saw the watch...

1246
01:07:22,427 --> 01:07:23,846
they'd confiscate it...

1247
01:07:23,887 --> 01:07:25,139
take it away.

1248
01:07:25,181 --> 01:07:29,727
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

1249
01:07:29,769 --> 01:07:32,480
He'd be damned if any slopes
put their greasy yellow hands...

1250
01:07:32,522 --> 01:07:34,733
on his boy's birthright,
so he hid it...

1251
01:07:34,774 --> 01:07:37,736
in one place he knew he could
hide somethin'... his ass.

1252
01:07:37,778 --> 01:07:41,324
Five long years he wore
this watch up his ass.

1253
01:07:41,366 --> 01:07:45,453
Then he died of dysentery,
he give me the watch.

1254
01:07:45,495 --> 01:07:49,207
I hid this uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass, two years.

1255
01:07:49,249 --> 01:07:52,670
Then... after seven years...

1256
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:55,672
I was sent home to my family.
And...

1257
01:07:55,714 --> 01:07:57,174
now...

1258
01:07:59,886 --> 01:08:02,889
little man,
I give the watch to you.

1259
01:08:25,833 --> 01:08:27,418
It's time, Butch.

1260
01:08:41,934 --> 01:08:45,063
...weighing 210 pounds...

1261
01:08:45,105 --> 01:08:48,065
Floyd Ray Wilson!

1262
01:08:50,902 --> 01:08:53,739
It's official.
It's official. Wilson is dead!

1263
01:08:53,781 --> 01:08:55,449
Dan,
that had to be the bloodiest...

1264
01:08:55,491 --> 01:08:57,952
and the most brutal fight
this city has ever seen.

1265
01:08:57,994 --> 01:09:00,538
Coolidge left faster than I've
ever seen a victorious boxer...

1266
01:09:00,579 --> 01:09:01,747
leave the ring.

1267
01:09:01,789 --> 01:09:03,249
Do you think he knew
Wilson was dead?

1268
01:09:03,291 --> 01:09:04,501
My guess would be yes, Richard.

1269
01:09:04,542 --> 01:09:07,254
I could see
the frenzy in his eyes...

1270
01:09:07,296 --> 01:09:08,798
give way to the realization
of what he was doing.

1271
01:09:08,839 --> 01:09:10,800
I think any man would have
left the ring that fast.

1272
01:09:10,842 --> 01:09:12,176
Do you feel this tragedy...

1273
01:09:12,217 --> 01:09:13,969
is gonna have an effect
on the world of boxing?

1274
01:09:14,011 --> 01:09:16,389
Such a tragedy can't help
but shake the boxing world...

1275
01:09:16,389 --> 01:09:17,807
to its very foundations...

1276
01:09:17,849 --> 01:09:20,394
but par amount importance is
during the sad weeks ahead...

1277
01:09:20,435 --> 01:09:22,438
the eyes of the WBA remain...

1278
01:09:57,603 --> 01:09:59,605
Mia.

1279
01:09:59,647 --> 01:10:01,941
Marsellus?

1280
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,901
I didn't do it, man.

1281
01:10:03,943 --> 01:10:05,987
How you doin'?

1282
01:10:06,029 --> 01:10:09,199
Great.
I never thanked you for dinner.

1283
01:10:10,701 --> 01:10:11,994
What you got?

1284
01:10:12,036 --> 01:10:12,995
He booked.

1285
01:10:13,037 --> 01:10:14,539
His trainer?

1286
01:10:14,581 --> 01:10:17,333
Says he don't know nothin'.
I believe him.

1287
01:10:17,375 --> 01:10:19,127
Think Butch surprised
his ass same as us.

1288
01:10:19,168 --> 01:10:21,713
No, we don't wanna think,
we wanna know.

1289
01:10:21,755 --> 01:10:23,841
Take him to the kennel,
sic the dogs on his ass.

1290
01:10:23,882 --> 01:10:26,677
We'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't.

1291
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:29,263
Butch's search...
how do you want it done?

1292
01:10:29,263 --> 01:10:32,016
I'm prepared to scour the earth
for that motherfucker.

1293
01:10:32,058 --> 01:10:33,726
If Butch goes to Indochina...

1294
01:10:33,768 --> 01:10:35,228
I want a nigger hidin'
in a bowl of rice...

1295
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:38,148
ready to pop a cap
in his ass.

1296
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:40,109
I will take care of it.

1297
01:10:49,995 --> 01:10:51,413
Mister?

1298
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:56,752
Hey, mister?

1299
01:10:56,835 --> 01:10:57,753
What?

1300
01:10:57,837 --> 01:10:59,630
You were in that fight.

1301
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:02,634
The fight on the radio.

1302
01:11:02,676 --> 01:11:04,177
You're the fighter?

1303
01:11:04,219 --> 01:11:06,180
Now, what gave you that idea?

1304
01:11:06,222 --> 01:11:09,726
No, ho, come on.

1305
01:11:09,767 --> 01:11:11,019
You're him.

1306
01:11:11,061 --> 01:11:13,564
I know you're him.

1307
01:11:15,191 --> 01:11:17,110
Tell me you're him.

1308
01:11:17,151 --> 01:11:19,945
I'm him.

1309
01:11:19,987 --> 01:11:22,573
You killed
the other boxing man.

1310
01:11:26,453 --> 01:11:28,497
He's dead?

1311
01:11:28,539 --> 01:11:30,833
The radio said he was dead.

1312
01:11:33,836 --> 01:11:35,922
Sorry about that, Floyd.

1313
01:11:37,382 --> 01:11:38,800
What does it feel like?

1314
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,011
What does what feel like?

1315
01:11:41,053 --> 01:11:43,014
Killing a man.

1316
01:11:45,432 --> 01:11:50,146
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.

1317
01:11:50,188 --> 01:11:51,856
Are you a weirdo?

1318
01:11:51,898 --> 01:11:53,442
No.

1319
01:11:53,483 --> 01:11:56,070
It is a subject
I have much interest in.

1320
01:11:57,904 --> 01:12:00,783
You are the first person
I've met...

1321
01:12:00,825 --> 01:12:02,577
who has killed somebody.

1322
01:12:05,205 --> 01:12:07,124
So...

1323
01:12:07,165 --> 01:12:10,126
what does it feel like
to kill a man?

1324
01:12:10,168 --> 01:12:12,129
I'll tell you what.

1325
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:15,049
You give me one of them
cigarettes you got up there...

1326
01:12:15,091 --> 01:12:16,926
and I'll tell you all about it.

1327
01:12:35,614 --> 01:12:37,324
So...

1328
01:12:37,366 --> 01:12:40,078
Esmarelda...

1329
01:12:40,119 --> 01:12:42,372
Villalobos.

1330
01:12:42,414 --> 01:12:43,582
Is that Mexican?

1331
01:12:43,624 --> 01:12:46,878
The name is Spanish,
but I am Colombian.

1332
01:12:46,919 --> 01:12:48,587
That's some handle
you got there, honey.

1333
01:12:48,629 --> 01:12:50,548
Thank you.

1334
01:12:50,589 --> 01:12:52,216
And what is your name?

1335
01:12:52,258 --> 01:12:56,513
Butch.

1336
01:12:56,513 --> 01:12:57,931
What does it mean?

1337
01:12:57,973 --> 01:13:01,852
I'm an American, honey.
Our names don't mean shit.

1338
01:13:01,894 --> 01:13:06,357
So, moving right along,
Esmarelda.

1339
01:13:06,399 --> 01:13:08,443
What is it you wanna know?

1340
01:13:08,485 --> 01:13:11,864
I want to know what it
feels like to kill a man.

1341
01:13:11,905 --> 01:13:13,366
I couldn't tell ya.

1342
01:13:19,413 --> 01:13:23,585
I didn't know he was dead
until you told me he was dead.

1343
01:13:23,627 --> 01:13:25,588
Now that I know he's dead...

1344
01:13:25,629 --> 01:13:28,632
you wanna know
how I feel about it?

1345
01:13:32,345 --> 01:13:35,348
I don't feel the least bit bad
about it.

1346
01:13:46,527 --> 01:13:48,571
What the fuck I tell ya, huh?

1347
01:13:48,613 --> 01:13:51,033
As soon as the word got out
the fix was in, man...

1348
01:13:51,074 --> 01:13:53,034
the odds went through the roof.

1349
01:13:53,076 --> 01:13:54,744
I know. I know.
Unbelievable.

1350
01:13:54,786 --> 01:13:56,246
Hey, fuck him, Scotty.

1351
01:13:56,246 --> 01:13:58,582
If he was a better boxer,
he'd still be alive.

1352
01:13:58,624 --> 01:13:59,834
He never laced up his gloves...

1353
01:13:59,875 --> 01:14:01,586
which he never shoulda done
in the first fuckin' place...

1354
01:14:01,628 --> 01:14:03,547
he'd still be alive.

1355
01:14:04,923 --> 01:14:06,884
Yeah, well...

1356
01:14:06,926 --> 01:14:08,970
who gives a fuck?
It's over now.

1357
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:11,640
Well, enough about the poor
unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

1358
01:14:11,681 --> 01:14:14,476
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr. Butch.

1359
01:14:15,728 --> 01:14:18,605
How many bookies
you lay it around on?

1360
01:14:18,605 --> 01:14:20,065
All eight?

1361
01:14:20,107 --> 01:14:22,151
How long to collect?

1362
01:14:22,193 --> 01:14:24,988
So you'll have it all
by tomorrow night?

1363
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:27,366
No, I understand,
a few stragglers aside.

1364
01:14:27,407 --> 01:14:29,201
Oh, fuck, Scotty,
that is good news...

1365
01:14:29,243 --> 01:14:31,411
that is great news, man.

1366
01:14:31,453 --> 01:14:32,996
Yeah, mm-hmm.

1367
01:14:33,038 --> 01:14:35,750
No, me and Fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.

1368
01:14:35,791 --> 01:14:38,962
It'll probably take us a couple
of days to get to Knoxville.

1369
01:14:39,004 --> 01:14:40,714
OK, my brother.

1370
01:14:42,174 --> 01:14:45,427
You're right.
You're goddamn right.

1371
01:14:45,469 --> 01:14:46,553
All right, Scotty.

1372
01:14:46,595 --> 01:14:49,015
Next time I see you,
we'll be on Tennessee time.

1373
01:14:49,015 --> 01:14:50,475
Be cool, brother.

1374
01:15:06,409 --> 01:15:08,536
45.60.

1375
01:15:12,916 --> 01:15:16,629
And, uh, here's a little...
somethin' for the effort.

1376
01:15:16,671 --> 01:15:17,839
Now...

1377
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,759
if anybody asks you
who your fare was tonight...

1378
01:15:20,801 --> 01:15:21,884
what are you gonna say?

1379
01:15:21,926 --> 01:15:23,219
The truth.

1380
01:15:23,261 --> 01:15:27,099
Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted Mexicans.

1381
01:15:29,310 --> 01:15:31,729
Bonsoir,
Esmarelda Villalobos.

1382
01:15:31,771 --> 01:15:34,232
Buenas noches, Butch.

1383
01:15:47,414 --> 01:15:50,668
Keep the light off.

1384
01:15:50,709 --> 01:15:52,712
Is that better,
sugar pop?

1385
01:15:52,753 --> 01:15:53,713
Oui.

1386
01:15:58,302 --> 01:16:00,095
Hard day at the office?

1387
01:16:00,136 --> 01:16:02,013
Pretty hard.

1388
01:16:02,055 --> 01:16:04,391
I got in a fight.

1389
01:16:04,433 --> 01:16:06,811
Poor baby.

1390
01:16:06,811 --> 01:16:08,605
Can we make spoons?

1391
01:16:08,646 --> 01:16:11,233
You know what? I was thinkin'
about takin' a shower.

1392
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:12,984
I'm stinkin' like a dog
over here.

1393
01:16:13,026 --> 01:16:16,488
Mmm. I like the way you stink.

1394
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:18,407
Let me take this jacket off.

1395
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:23,288
I was looking at myself
in the mirror.

1396
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:24,665
Uh-huh.

1397
01:16:24,665 --> 01:16:27,167
I wish I had a pot.

1398
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:29,544
You were lookin' at yourself
in the mirror...

1399
01:16:29,544 --> 01:16:31,338
and you wish you had some pot?

1400
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:33,299
A pot.

1401
01:16:33,341 --> 01:16:35,343
A pot belly.

1402
01:16:35,426 --> 01:16:37,554
Pot bellies are sexy.

1403
01:16:37,595 --> 01:16:40,515
Well, you should be happy...

1404
01:16:40,557 --> 01:16:42,058
'cause you have one.

1405
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:43,435
Shut up, fatso!

1406
01:16:43,477 --> 01:16:45,521
I don't have a pot.

1407
01:16:45,563 --> 01:16:47,315
I have a bit of a tummy...

1408
01:16:47,356 --> 01:16:49,234
like Madonna
when she did "Lucky Star."

1409
01:16:49,275 --> 01:16:50,818
It's not the same thing.

1410
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:52,612
I didn't know
there was such a difference...

1411
01:16:52,653 --> 01:16:54,614
between a pot belly and a tummy.

1412
01:16:54,656 --> 01:16:57,242
The difference is huge.

1413
01:16:58,619 --> 01:17:00,872
Would you like it
if I had a pot belly?

1414
01:17:00,913 --> 01:17:03,750
No. Pot bellies make a man...

1415
01:17:03,792 --> 01:17:06,587
look either oafish
or like a gorilla.

1416
01:17:06,628 --> 01:17:10,633
But on a woman,
a pot belly is very sexy.

1417
01:17:10,675 --> 01:17:12,010
The rest of you is normal.

1418
01:17:12,052 --> 01:17:16,431
Normal face, normal legs,
normal hips, normal ass...

1419
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:20,728
but with a big perfectly
round pot belly.

1420
01:17:20,769 --> 01:17:23,231
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt
two sizes too small...

1421
01:17:23,272 --> 01:17:24,858
to accentuate it.

1422
01:17:24,899 --> 01:17:27,903
You think men
would find that attractive?

1423
01:17:27,945 --> 01:17:30,905
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.

1424
01:17:30,947 --> 01:17:33,325
It's unfortunate what we
find pleasing to the touch...

1425
01:17:33,367 --> 01:17:37,705
and pleasing to the eye
is seldom the same.

1426
01:17:39,541 --> 01:17:41,500
If you had a pot belly...

1427
01:17:41,542 --> 01:17:43,503
I would punch you in it.

1428
01:17:43,545 --> 01:17:46,048
- You'd punch me in my belly?
- Right in the belly.

1429
01:17:46,089 --> 01:17:48,133
Ah! I'd smother you.

1430
01:17:48,175 --> 01:17:51,596
I'd drop it right on your face
till you couldn't breathe.

1431
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:53,640
You'd do that?

1432
01:17:53,682 --> 01:17:55,266
Yes. Yes.

1433
01:18:10,617 --> 01:18:11,993
Did you get everything?

1434
01:18:12,035 --> 01:18:13,578
Yes, I did.

1435
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:15,789
Good job, sugar pop.

1436
01:18:15,831 --> 01:18:16,999
Did everything go as planned?

1437
01:18:17,041 --> 01:18:19,168
You didn't listen to the... Ow!

1438
01:18:20,669 --> 01:18:21,837
You didn't listen to the radio?

1439
01:18:21,879 --> 01:18:23,840
I never listen to your fights.

1440
01:18:23,881 --> 01:18:25,216
Were you the winner?

1441
01:18:25,258 --> 01:18:27,636
I won, all right.

1442
01:18:27,678 --> 01:18:29,263
Are you still retiring?

1443
01:18:29,305 --> 01:18:30,639
Sure am.

1444
01:18:30,681 --> 01:18:33,059
So, it all worked out
in the finish?

1445
01:18:33,101 --> 01:18:36,522
We're not at the finish yet,
baby.

1446
01:18:38,023 --> 01:18:39,275
Mmm.

1447
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:48,535
We're in a lot of danger,
aren't we?

1448
01:18:49,661 --> 01:18:52,915
If they find us,
they'll kill us, won't they?

1449
01:18:55,335 --> 01:18:57,671
But they won't find us,
will they?

1450
01:19:01,257 --> 01:19:04,219
Do you still want me
to go with you?

1451
01:19:05,512 --> 01:19:10,101
I don't want to be a burden
or a nuisance, it's...

1452
01:19:15,899 --> 01:19:17,609
Say it.

1453
01:19:18,777 --> 01:19:20,738
Fabienne...

1454
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:23,323
I want you to be with me.

1455
01:19:24,408 --> 01:19:25,701
Forever?

1456
01:19:25,743 --> 01:19:27,370
Forever and ever.

1457
01:19:29,414 --> 01:19:31,250
Do you love me?

1458
01:19:31,291 --> 01:19:33,252
Very, very much.

1459
01:19:35,713 --> 01:19:37,005
Mmm.

1460
01:19:39,383 --> 01:19:40,885
Butch?

1461
01:19:40,927 --> 01:19:42,011
Yes.

1462
01:19:43,138 --> 01:19:45,891
Will you give me oral pleasure?

1463
01:19:47,268 --> 01:19:48,769
Will you kiss it?

1464
01:19:51,063 --> 01:19:52,732
But you first.

1465
01:19:53,775 --> 01:19:56,236
OK.

1466
01:19:56,278 --> 01:19:57,529
Mmm.

1467
01:20:03,077 --> 01:20:04,704
Mmm.

1468
01:20:06,456 --> 01:20:09,001
Butch.

1469
01:20:09,043 --> 01:20:12,005
Mon amour.
L'aventure commence.

1470
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,299
Mmm.

1471
01:20:28,105 --> 01:20:30,650
I think I cracked a rib.

1472
01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:32,027
Giving me oral pleasure?

1473
01:20:32,068 --> 01:20:33,737
No, retard. From the fight.

1474
01:20:33,779 --> 01:20:35,072
Don't call me retard.

1475
01:20:35,114 --> 01:20:37,199
My name is Fabby.

1476
01:20:37,241 --> 01:20:38,534
My name is Fabienne.

1477
01:20:38,576 --> 01:20:39,868
Stop it. Stop it.

1478
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:41,245
My name is Fabienne.

1479
01:20:41,287 --> 01:20:42,496
Shut up, fuckhead!

1480
01:20:42,538 --> 01:20:44,457
I hate that mongoloid voice.

1481
01:20:44,457 --> 01:20:47,628
OK, OK. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1482
01:20:48,712 --> 01:20:50,047
I take it back.

1483
01:20:52,966 --> 01:20:56,220
Would you hand me a dry towel,
Miss Beautiful Tulip?

1484
01:20:56,262 --> 01:20:57,889
Oh, I like that.

1485
01:20:57,931 --> 01:20:59,975
I like being called a tulip.

1486
01:21:00,058 --> 01:21:02,227
Tulip is much better
than mongoloid.

1487
01:21:02,269 --> 01:21:03,729
I didn't call you a mongoloid.

1488
01:21:03,771 --> 01:21:07,608
I called you a retard,
and I took it back.

1489
01:21:07,649 --> 01:21:08,609
Uhh.

1490
01:21:08,651 --> 01:21:09,944
Butch?

1491
01:21:09,986 --> 01:21:11,779
Yes, lemon pie.

1492
01:21:11,779 --> 01:21:13,114
Where are we going to go?

1493
01:21:13,156 --> 01:21:15,409
Well, I'm not sure yet.

1494
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:17,661
Wherever you want.

1495
01:21:17,661 --> 01:21:19,663
We're gonna get
a lot of money from this...

1496
01:21:19,663 --> 01:21:21,749
but it ain't gonna be
the kinda money...

1497
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:25,879
that we can live like hogs
in the fat house forever.

1498
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,881
I was thinkin' maybe
we could go down...

1499
01:21:27,964 --> 01:21:30,301
someplace
in the South Pacific.

1500
01:21:30,342 --> 01:21:31,510
The kinda money
we're gonna have...

1501
01:21:31,552 --> 01:21:33,638
is gonna carry us
a long way down there.

1502
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,265
If we wanted,
we could live in Bora Bora?

1503
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:36,725
You betcha.

1504
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:39,061
And if after a while
you didn't dig that...

1505
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:42,398
go someplace else,
maybe Tahiti. Mexico.

1506
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,400
But I do not speak Spanish.

1507
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:47,528
Well, you do not speak
Bora Boran, either.

1508
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:49,573
Besides, Mexican is easy.

1509
01:21:49,614 --> 01:21:51,241
¿Dónde está el zapateria?

1510
01:21:51,283 --> 01:21:52,576
What does that mean?

1511
01:21:52,618 --> 01:21:54,412
Where is the shoe store?

1512
01:21:54,453 --> 01:21:55,621
¿Dónde está...

1513
01:21:55,663 --> 01:21:56,914
Spit, please.

1514
01:21:58,123 --> 01:22:00,042
¿Dónde está el zapateria?

1515
01:22:00,084 --> 01:22:02,253
Excellent pronunciation.

1516
01:22:02,295 --> 01:22:03,714
Mmm.

1517
01:22:03,755 --> 01:22:06,467
You'll be my little mamacita
in no time.

1518
01:22:07,677 --> 01:22:10,053
¿Qué hora es?

1519
01:22:10,095 --> 01:22:12,348
What time is it?

1520
01:22:12,348 --> 01:22:13,683
Time for bed.

1521
01:22:15,059 --> 01:22:16,937
Sweet dreams, jellybean.

1522
01:22:24,695 --> 01:22:25,863
Butch?

1523
01:22:32,538 --> 01:22:33,998
Never mind.

1524
01:22:41,339 --> 01:22:42,966
Ohh!

1525
01:22:43,007 --> 01:22:45,010
Merde.

1526
01:22:45,052 --> 01:22:46,762
You startled me.

1527
01:22:46,804 --> 01:22:49,222
Did you have a bad dream?

1528
01:22:51,350 --> 01:22:52,685
Shit.

1529
01:22:58,567 --> 01:23:00,361
What is this you're watching?

1530
01:23:00,402 --> 01:23:03,197
A motorcycle movie.

1531
01:23:03,239 --> 01:23:04,908
I'm not sure the name.

1532
01:23:06,743 --> 01:23:07,995
Are you watchin' it?

1533
01:23:07,995 --> 01:23:11,624
In a way.

1534
01:23:11,666 --> 01:23:13,333
It's a little early
in the morning...

1535
01:23:13,375 --> 01:23:15,795
for explosions and war.

1536
01:23:17,755 --> 01:23:19,049
What was it about?

1537
01:23:19,090 --> 01:23:20,842
How should I know, Fabienne?

1538
01:23:20,884 --> 01:23:23,053
You were the one
who was watchin' it.

1539
01:23:23,095 --> 01:23:25,223
No, imbecile,
what was your dream about?

1540
01:23:25,264 --> 01:23:28,726
I don't know. I don't remember.

1541
01:23:28,768 --> 01:23:31,437
It's really rare
that I remember my dreams.

1542
01:23:31,479 --> 01:23:33,565
Well, let's look
at the grumpy man...

1543
01:23:33,607 --> 01:23:35,317
in the morning.

1544
01:23:35,359 --> 01:23:37,194
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1545
01:23:37,236 --> 01:23:39,696
Why don't you get up
and we'll get some breakfast?

1546
01:23:39,738 --> 01:23:42,032
One more kiss,
and I'll get up.

1547
01:23:42,074 --> 01:23:44,702
Mmm.

1548
01:23:44,744 --> 01:23:45,829
Satisfied?

1549
01:23:45,870 --> 01:23:48,332
Yep.

1550
01:23:48,415 --> 01:23:51,793
Then get up, lazy bones.

1551
01:23:51,835 --> 01:23:53,086
Ohh.

1552
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:56,257
God. Unh.

1553
01:23:56,298 --> 01:23:57,800
What time is it?

1554
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:00,011
Almost 9:00 in the morning.

1555
01:24:00,053 --> 01:24:02,139
What time does our train arrive?

1556
01:24:02,180 --> 01:24:03,599
11:00.

1557
01:24:03,641 --> 01:24:05,684
You know what I'm gonna
have for breakfast?

1558
01:24:05,725 --> 01:24:08,228
What, lemon pie?

1559
01:24:08,270 --> 01:24:10,815
I'm gonna order a big plate...

1560
01:24:10,856 --> 01:24:14,236
of blueberry pancakes
with maple syrup...

1561
01:24:14,277 --> 01:24:17,697
eggs over easy,
and five sausages.

1562
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:20,242
Anything to drink with that?

1563
01:24:20,283 --> 01:24:22,411
Ah, that looks nice.

1564
01:24:23,579 --> 01:24:24,956
To drink...

1565
01:24:24,997 --> 01:24:29,711
a tall glass of orange juice
and a black cup of coffee.

1566
01:24:29,753 --> 01:24:32,465
After that, I'm going to
have a slice of pie.

1567
01:24:32,506 --> 01:24:34,467
Pie for breakfast?

1568
01:24:34,509 --> 01:24:38,347
Any time of the day
is a good time for pie.

1569
01:24:38,388 --> 01:24:40,599
Blueberry pie
to go with the pancakes.

1570
01:24:40,641 --> 01:24:44,603
And on top, a thin slice
of melted cheese...

1571
01:24:44,645 --> 01:24:45,813
Where's my watch?

1572
01:24:51,194 --> 01:24:53,364
It's there.

1573
01:24:53,405 --> 01:24:55,490
No, it's not.

1574
01:24:55,532 --> 01:24:56,575
Have you looked?

1575
01:24:56,617 --> 01:24:57,659
Yes, I fucking looked.

1576
01:24:57,701 --> 01:25:00,538
What the fuck
do you think I'm doing?

1577
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:02,332
You sure you got it?

1578
01:25:02,373 --> 01:25:04,710
Yes. Bedside table drawer.

1579
01:25:04,751 --> 01:25:06,336
On the little kangaroo?

1580
01:25:06,378 --> 01:25:07,921
Yes.
It was on the little kangaroo.

1581
01:25:07,962 --> 01:25:11,175
Yeah, well, it's not here now.

1582
01:25:12,259 --> 01:25:14,095
Well, it should be.

1583
01:25:14,095 --> 01:25:16,931
It most definitely should be,
but it's not here now.

1584
01:25:16,973 --> 01:25:17,974
So where the fuck is it?

1585
01:25:23,647 --> 01:25:25,274
Fabienne...

1586
01:25:25,315 --> 01:25:28,319
that was my father's
fucking watch.

1587
01:25:29,487 --> 01:25:30,906
Do you have any idea
what he had to go through...

1588
01:25:30,947 --> 01:25:32,990
to get me that watch?

1589
01:25:33,032 --> 01:25:35,410
I don't have time to go into it,
but he went through a lot.

1590
01:25:35,452 --> 01:25:36,995
All this other shit
you could set on fire...

1591
01:25:37,079 --> 01:25:41,918
but I specifically reminded you
not to forget the fucking watch!

1592
01:25:41,959 --> 01:25:42,919
Now think.

1593
01:25:42,961 --> 01:25:45,380
Did you get it?

1594
01:25:45,422 --> 01:25:46,464
I believe so.

1595
01:25:46,505 --> 01:25:47,924
You believe so?
What the fuck does that mean?

1596
01:25:47,966 --> 01:25:49,885
You either did,
or you didn't get it!

1597
01:25:51,845 --> 01:25:53,180
Then I did.

1598
01:25:55,433 --> 01:25:56,517
Are you sure?

1599
01:25:58,562 --> 01:25:59,521
No.

1600
01:26:01,857 --> 01:26:03,609
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1601
01:26:03,609 --> 01:26:05,069
Motherfucker!

1602
01:26:05,153 --> 01:26:07,405
- Motherfucker!
- Aah!

1603
01:26:07,447 --> 01:26:10,659
Do you know how
fucking stupid you fucking are?

1604
01:26:10,701 --> 01:26:12,661
No!

1605
01:26:15,289 --> 01:26:17,291
It's not your fault.

1606
01:26:22,339 --> 01:26:25,884
If you left it
at the apartment...

1607
01:26:30,348 --> 01:26:33,601
If you left it at the apartment,
it's not your fault.

1608
01:26:35,771 --> 01:26:38,773
I had you bring
a bunch of stuff.

1609
01:26:41,235 --> 01:26:44,196
I reminded you about it,
but I didn't illustrate...

1610
01:26:44,238 --> 01:26:47,784
how personal the watch
was to me.

1611
01:26:47,826 --> 01:26:49,161
If all I gave a fuck about
was the watch...

1612
01:26:49,202 --> 01:26:52,414
I should've told you that.

1613
01:26:52,455 --> 01:26:55,834
You're not a mind reader,
are you?

1614
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:08,307
I... I'm sorry.

1615
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:10,351
Don't be.

1616
01:27:10,392 --> 01:27:12,061
It just means
I can't have breakfast with you.

1617
01:27:13,479 --> 01:27:14,814
Why does it mean that?

1618
01:27:17,859 --> 01:27:20,737
Because I got to go back to
my apartment and get my watch.

1619
01:27:22,364 --> 01:27:24,450
Won't the gangsters
be looking for you there?

1620
01:27:24,492 --> 01:27:26,244
Well...

1621
01:27:26,285 --> 01:27:28,747
that's what I'm going
to find out.

1622
01:27:28,788 --> 01:27:32,084
If they are and I don't think
I can handle it...

1623
01:27:32,126 --> 01:27:33,252
Then I'll split.

1624
01:27:33,294 --> 01:27:37,257
I saw your watch.
I thought I brought it.

1625
01:27:37,299 --> 01:27:38,508
I'm so sorry.

1626
01:27:43,722 --> 01:27:45,975
Here's some money.

1627
01:27:46,016 --> 01:27:48,227
Go out and get those pancakes.
Have a nice breakfast.

1628
01:27:48,269 --> 01:27:49,562
I'll take your Honda.

1629
01:27:49,604 --> 01:27:51,606
I'll be back before
you can say blueberry pie.

1630
01:27:51,648 --> 01:27:53,191
Blueberry pie.

1631
01:27:55,026 --> 01:27:57,279
Maybe not that fast...

1632
01:27:57,321 --> 01:27:59,239
but pretty fast, OK?

1633
01:27:59,281 --> 01:28:00,449
OK.

1634
01:28:00,491 --> 01:28:02,702
Bye.

1635
01:28:02,744 --> 01:28:05,622
Shit! Of all the fucking things
she could fucking forget...

1636
01:28:05,664 --> 01:28:07,373
she forgets my father's watch!

1637
01:28:07,415 --> 01:28:09,334
I specifically reminded her.

1638
01:28:09,376 --> 01:28:11,879
"Bedside table,
on the kangaroo."

1639
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:15,216
I said the words, "Don't forget
my father's watch."

1640
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,020
Lookin' good, Butch.

1641
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:47,538
Aah!

1642
01:33:52,596 --> 01:33:54,724
Flowers on the wall

1643
01:33:54,765 --> 01:33:58,395
That don't bother me at all

1644
01:33:58,437 --> 01:34:00,773
Playin' solitaire till dawn

1645
01:34:00,814 --> 01:34:03,567
With a deck of 51

1646
01:34:03,608 --> 01:34:06,320
That's how you're going
to beat 'em, Butch.

1647
01:34:06,362 --> 01:34:07,738
They keep underestimating you.

1648
01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:09,115
Kangaroo

1649
01:34:09,157 --> 01:34:11,076
Now, don't tell me

1650
01:34:12,577 --> 01:34:16,122
Countin' flowers on the wall

1651
01:34:16,164 --> 01:34:19,084
That don't bother me at all

1652
01:34:19,126 --> 01:34:20,753
Playin'...

1653
01:34:20,795 --> 01:34:22,463
Solitaire till dawn

1654
01:34:22,505 --> 01:34:25,217
With a deck of 51

1655
01:34:25,258 --> 01:34:27,553
Smoking cigarettes

1656
01:34:27,594 --> 01:34:30,514
And watching "Captain Kangaroo"

1657
01:34:30,555 --> 01:34:33,183
Now, don't tell me

1658
01:34:33,225 --> 01:34:35,478
I've nothin' to do

1659
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,897
It's good to see you,
I must go

1660
01:34:37,897 --> 01:34:39,983
I know I look a fright

1661
01:34:40,025 --> 01:34:42,527
Motherfucker.

1662
01:34:45,030 --> 01:34:46,240
Huhh!

1663
01:34:54,792 --> 01:34:55,751
He's dead.

1664
01:34:55,793 --> 01:34:56,752
Oh, my God.

1665
01:34:56,794 --> 01:34:57,920
He's dead.

1666
01:35:08,182 --> 01:35:10,559
If you need someone to go
to court, I'll be glad to help.

1667
01:35:10,601 --> 01:35:11,727
That guy was a drunken maniac.

1668
01:35:11,769 --> 01:35:14,606
He hit you, and then he
crashed into that car.

1669
01:35:14,648 --> 01:35:15,649
Who?

1670
01:35:15,732 --> 01:35:16,692
Him.

1671
01:35:21,029 --> 01:35:22,990
I'll be damned.

1672
01:35:26,369 --> 01:35:27,370
Uhh.

1673
01:35:35,504 --> 01:35:38,549
Aah! Aah! Uhh!

1674
01:35:38,591 --> 01:35:39,842
Aah!

1675
01:35:39,884 --> 01:35:41,928
I'm shot!

1676
01:35:41,928 --> 01:35:42,888
Uhh!

1677
01:35:46,766 --> 01:35:47,726
Uhh!

1678
01:35:55,193 --> 01:35:56,570
Uhh!

1679
01:36:03,786 --> 01:36:07,415
- Can I help you with something?
- Shut the fuck up.

1680
01:36:07,498 --> 01:36:09,918
Now, you just wait
a goddamn minute now.

1681
01:36:09,918 --> 01:36:12,045
What the fuck are you up to?

1682
01:36:12,086 --> 01:36:13,505
Come here, motherfucker!

1683
01:36:13,546 --> 01:36:14,673
- Uhh!
- Uhh!

1684
01:36:14,714 --> 01:36:16,091
Uhh!

1685
01:36:16,133 --> 01:36:17,927
You feel that sting,
big boy, huh?

1686
01:36:17,968 --> 01:36:19,637
That's pride
fucking with you, see?

1687
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:21,681
You got to fight
through that shit.

1688
01:36:21,723 --> 01:36:23,141
Uhh! Huh?

1689
01:36:23,183 --> 01:36:24,393
You better kill me.

1690
01:36:24,434 --> 01:36:26,395
Yeah,
somebody's going to get killed.

1691
01:36:26,437 --> 01:36:28,856
Somebody's going to get their
motherfucking head blown to...

1692
01:36:28,898 --> 01:36:31,401
Hold it right there,
God damn it.

1693
01:36:31,443 --> 01:36:33,362
This ain't none
of your business, mister.

1694
01:36:33,362 --> 01:36:35,281
I'm making it my business.

1695
01:36:35,322 --> 01:36:36,281
Toss the weapon.

1696
01:36:36,323 --> 01:36:38,075
You don't understand, man.

1697
01:36:38,116 --> 01:36:40,202
Toss the weapon.

1698
01:36:46,877 --> 01:36:48,503
Take your foot off the nigger.

1699
01:36:48,545 --> 01:36:50,255
Put your hands behind your head.

1700
01:36:50,255 --> 01:36:52,674
Approach the counter right now.

1701
01:36:52,716 --> 01:36:55,720
This motherfucker's
trying to kill me.

1702
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:57,096
Shut up.

1703
01:36:57,138 --> 01:36:59,683
Keep a-comin'. Come on.

1704
01:36:59,725 --> 01:37:00,726
Uhh!

1705
01:37:24,586 --> 01:37:26,629
Zed, it's Maynard.

1706
01:37:27,755 --> 01:37:30,300
Yeah. The spider
just caught a couple flies.

1707
01:38:18,521 --> 01:38:22,651
Nobody kills anybody in my place
of business except me or Zed.

1708
01:38:26,739 --> 01:38:28,199
That's Zed.

1709
01:38:41,297 --> 01:38:43,049
I thought you said
you waited for me.

1710
01:38:43,090 --> 01:38:44,592
I did.

1711
01:38:49,765 --> 01:38:52,351
So how come
they're all beat up?

1712
01:38:52,393 --> 01:38:54,646
They did that
to each other, man.

1713
01:38:54,687 --> 01:38:56,021
They came in fighting.

1714
01:38:56,063 --> 01:39:00,151
Now, this one right here,
he was going to shoot that one.

1715
01:39:00,193 --> 01:39:01,152
Is that right?

1716
01:39:01,194 --> 01:39:03,822
You going to shoot him, boy?

1717
01:39:05,032 --> 01:39:06,492
Huh?

1718
01:39:08,660 --> 01:39:11,956
Hey, is Grace all right
out front?

1719
01:39:11,998 --> 01:39:13,708
Yeah. It ain't Tuesday, is it?

1720
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:15,085
No. It's Thursday.

1721
01:39:15,126 --> 01:39:16,753
She ought to be fine.

1722
01:39:16,753 --> 01:39:17,755
Mm-hmm.

1723
01:39:19,173 --> 01:39:20,800
Ahh. Well...

1724
01:39:21,968 --> 01:39:24,596
Bring out The Gimp.

1725
01:39:24,638 --> 01:39:27,266
I think The Gimp's sleeping.

1726
01:39:27,308 --> 01:39:31,479
I guess you'll just have to go
wake him up, now, won't you?

1727
01:40:10,690 --> 01:40:11,691
Get up.

1728
01:40:25,372 --> 01:40:26,916
Get down.

1729
01:40:37,678 --> 01:40:39,096
Which one of 'em
you want to do first?

1730
01:40:41,724 --> 01:40:44,227
I ain't for sure yet.

1731
01:40:47,856 --> 01:40:51,486
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo.

1732
01:40:51,486 --> 01:40:55,741
Catch a nigger by the toe.

1733
01:40:55,741 --> 01:40:57,534
If he hollers...

1734
01:40:57,576 --> 01:40:59,579
let him go.

1735
01:40:59,579 --> 01:41:02,791
Eenie, meenie...

1736
01:41:02,832 --> 01:41:04,834
minie, mo.

1737
01:41:06,795 --> 01:41:10,048
My mother said...

1738
01:41:10,090 --> 01:41:13,469
To pick the perfect one...

1739
01:41:13,511 --> 01:41:16,680
and you are...

1740
01:41:18,933 --> 01:41:20,435
It.

1741
01:41:22,187 --> 01:41:23,647
I guess that means you,
big boy.

1742
01:41:26,192 --> 01:41:27,527
Shh.

1743
01:41:28,736 --> 01:41:30,696
You want to do it in here?

1744
01:41:30,738 --> 01:41:34,075
No. Let's do it back there
in Russell's old room.

1745
01:41:34,117 --> 01:41:36,870
Sounds good to me.

1746
01:41:44,420 --> 01:41:46,547
Uhh. Uhh.

1747
01:42:00,271 --> 01:42:04,276
You keep an eye on this one.

1748
01:42:24,591 --> 01:42:25,550
Yeah!

1749
01:42:25,592 --> 01:42:26,552
Uhh!

1750
01:42:32,350 --> 01:42:33,350
Yeah!

1751
01:42:36,938 --> 01:42:38,023
Yeah, go!

1752
01:42:38,064 --> 01:42:40,108
Come on, motherfucker!

1753
01:42:40,150 --> 01:42:41,861
Now, motherfucker!

1754
01:42:45,239 --> 01:42:47,199
Come on!

1755
01:42:47,199 --> 01:42:48,159
Yeah!

1756
01:42:50,245 --> 01:42:52,873
Uhh! Uhh! Aah!

1757
01:42:52,914 --> 01:42:54,249
Aah!

1758
01:42:56,460 --> 01:42:57,420
Yeah!

1759
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:06,221
Yeah!

1760
01:43:08,682 --> 01:43:10,142
Yeah!

1761
01:43:14,104 --> 01:43:15,314
Yee!

1762
01:43:15,398 --> 01:43:16,941
Yee-haw!

1763
01:43:18,193 --> 01:43:19,361
Go!

1764
01:43:20,862 --> 01:43:23,157
Come on, motherfucker!

1765
01:43:23,199 --> 01:43:24,825
Aah!

1766
01:43:24,866 --> 01:43:27,411
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

1767
01:43:27,453 --> 01:43:28,913
Come on!

1768
01:43:37,631 --> 01:43:39,132
Yeah!

1769
01:43:45,557 --> 01:43:46,516
Yeah!

1770
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:53,441
Uhh!

1771
01:44:00,533 --> 01:44:02,868
Now, motherfucker!

1772
01:44:02,868 --> 01:44:04,578
Aah!

1773
01:44:04,620 --> 01:44:06,998
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

1774
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:08,583
Come on!

1775
01:44:08,625 --> 01:44:09,876
Now!

1776
01:44:15,507 --> 01:44:16,508
Yeah!

1777
01:44:24,226 --> 01:44:25,227
Yeah!

1778
01:44:33,736 --> 01:44:34,904
Yeah!

1779
01:44:34,946 --> 01:44:36,448
Yeah, baby!

1780
01:44:52,049 --> 01:44:54,134
Shut the fuck up!

1781
01:44:57,513 --> 01:44:58,973
Fuck!

1782
01:45:01,809 --> 01:45:03,311
Come on!

1783
01:45:09,109 --> 01:45:10,193
Yeah.

1784
01:45:20,456 --> 01:45:21,958
Haah!

1785
01:45:27,548 --> 01:45:28,549
Aah!

1786
01:45:31,218 --> 01:45:32,177
Ohh!

1787
01:45:36,390 --> 01:45:37,851
Ohh! Uhh!

1788
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:43,441
You want that gun,
don't you, Zed?

1789
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:49,947
Go ahead and pick it up.

1790
01:45:52,492 --> 01:45:54,703
Go ahead, pick it up.

1791
01:45:57,163 --> 01:45:59,458
Come on. Atta boy.

1792
01:46:01,168 --> 01:46:03,880
I want you to pick it up...

1793
01:46:03,921 --> 01:46:04,964
Zed.

1794
01:46:09,344 --> 01:46:12,431
Step aside, Butch.

1795
01:46:16,978 --> 01:46:18,980
Uhh!

1796
01:46:24,611 --> 01:46:28,073
Fuck!

1797
01:46:30,660 --> 01:46:32,161
You OK?

1798
01:46:34,789 --> 01:46:36,124
No, man.

1799
01:46:37,667 --> 01:46:39,961
I'm pretty fucking far from OK.

1800
01:46:40,003 --> 01:46:41,463
Uhh!

1801
01:46:48,013 --> 01:46:49,556
Aah!

1802
01:46:51,892 --> 01:46:53,394
What now?

1803
01:46:55,063 --> 01:46:56,481
Uhh!

1804
01:46:56,523 --> 01:46:58,025
What now?

1805
01:46:59,527 --> 01:47:02,070
Let me tell you what now.

1806
01:47:03,322 --> 01:47:06,242
I'm going to call a couple
of hard pipe-hitting niggers...

1807
01:47:06,284 --> 01:47:08,620
to go to work
on the homes here...

1808
01:47:08,661 --> 01:47:14,000
with a pair of pliers
and a blow torch.

1809
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,628
You hear me talking,
hillbilly boy?

1810
01:47:18,130 --> 01:47:20,466
I ain't through
with you by a damn sight.

1811
01:47:20,508 --> 01:47:24,513
I'm going to get
medieval on your ass.

1812
01:47:27,265 --> 01:47:30,227
I meant, what now
between me and you?

1813
01:47:35,024 --> 01:47:37,027
Oh, that what now.

1814
01:47:38,736 --> 01:47:43,241
I tell you what now
between me and you.

1815
01:47:44,243 --> 01:47:47,246
There is no me and you...

1816
01:47:48,581 --> 01:47:50,083
not no more.

1817
01:47:53,711 --> 01:47:55,714
So are we cool?

1818
01:47:57,049 --> 01:47:59,009
Yeah, we cool.

1819
01:48:00,052 --> 01:48:01,512
Two things...

1820
01:48:03,181 --> 01:48:05,683
Don't tell nobody about this.

1821
01:48:07,518 --> 01:48:11,064
This shit is between me, you...

1822
01:48:11,106 --> 01:48:12,691
and Mr. Soon To Be Living...

1823
01:48:12,775 --> 01:48:15,778
The Rest Of His Short-Ass Life
In Agonizing Pain...

1824
01:48:15,820 --> 01:48:17,322
rapist here.

1825
01:48:18,865 --> 01:48:21,785
It ain't nobody else's business.

1826
01:48:21,827 --> 01:48:23,704
Two...

1827
01:48:23,746 --> 01:48:26,333
You leave town tonight...

1828
01:48:26,374 --> 01:48:28,627
right now.

1829
01:48:28,669 --> 01:48:30,587
And when you're gone...

1830
01:48:30,628 --> 01:48:33,423
you stay gone...
or you be gone.

1831
01:48:35,468 --> 01:48:39,055
You lost all your L.A.
Privileges. Deal?

1832
01:48:40,474 --> 01:48:41,475
Deal.

1833
01:48:43,810 --> 01:48:46,813
Get your ass out of here.

1834
01:48:56,824 --> 01:48:58,868
Ohh!

1835
01:49:02,873 --> 01:49:04,208
Uhh!

1836
01:49:47,507 --> 01:49:48,967
Fabienne!

1837
01:49:50,803 --> 01:49:51,887
Fabienne!

1838
01:49:54,891 --> 01:49:57,018
Fabienne.
Come on, baby, come on.

1839
01:49:57,060 --> 01:49:58,895
Get your shit.
We got to go right now.

1840
01:49:58,936 --> 01:50:00,980
I was so worried.
What about our bags?

1841
01:50:01,022 --> 01:50:02,566
Fuck the bags.
If we don't split right now...

1842
01:50:02,607 --> 01:50:04,401
we'll miss the train.
I'll be downstairs.

1843
01:50:04,443 --> 01:50:05,778
Is everything well?

1844
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:07,697
Just come on!
No talking now.

1845
01:50:07,738 --> 01:50:11,034
Are we in danger?

1846
01:50:13,620 --> 01:50:15,497
Come on, honey!

1847
01:50:18,333 --> 01:50:19,960
Where did you get
this motorcycle?

1848
01:50:20,002 --> 01:50:21,921
It's not a motorcycle, baby.
It's a chopper.

1849
01:50:21,963 --> 01:50:23,298
Come on, let's go.

1850
01:50:23,339 --> 01:50:24,590
What happened to my Honda?

1851
01:50:24,632 --> 01:50:27,051
I'm sorry, baby.
I had to crash that Honda.

1852
01:50:27,093 --> 01:50:28,428
Will you come on now, please?

1853
01:50:28,470 --> 01:50:31,890
Come on,
let's go, let's go.

1854
01:50:35,353 --> 01:50:36,771
You're hurt?

1855
01:50:36,812 --> 01:50:38,397
No, no.
I might've broken my nose.

1856
01:50:38,397 --> 01:50:40,400
It's no biggie.
Come on, hop on.

1857
01:50:40,441 --> 01:50:42,026
Baby, please.

1858
01:50:42,068 --> 01:50:45,072
Honey, we got to hit
the fucking road. Get on.

1859
01:50:47,908 --> 01:50:49,826
I'm sorry.
Come here, come here.

1860
01:50:49,868 --> 01:50:53,414
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1861
01:50:53,456 --> 01:50:56,668
You were gone so long I started
to think dreadful thoughts.

1862
01:50:56,710 --> 01:50:58,253
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.
I didn't mean to worry you.

1863
01:50:58,295 --> 01:51:00,798
- How was your breakfast?
- It was good.

1864
01:51:00,798 --> 01:51:02,632
Did you get
the blueberry pancakes?

1865
01:51:02,674 --> 01:51:04,134
They didn't have
blueberry pancakes.

1866
01:51:04,218 --> 01:51:06,178
I had to get buttermilk.
Are you sure you're OK?

1867
01:51:06,220 --> 01:51:09,098
Honey, since I left you,
this has been without a doubt...

1868
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:11,017
the single weirdest
fucking day of my life.

1869
01:51:11,059 --> 01:51:12,811
Come on, hop on.
I'll tell you all about it.

1870
01:51:12,853 --> 01:51:15,273
Come on, get on. Gotta go.

1871
01:51:15,273 --> 01:51:18,234
Whose motorcycle is this?

1872
01:51:18,276 --> 01:51:19,402
It's a chopper, baby.

1873
01:51:19,486 --> 01:51:21,530
- Whose chopper is this?
- Zed's.

1874
01:51:21,572 --> 01:51:24,617
- Who's Zed?
- Zed's dead, baby.

1875
01:51:24,659 --> 01:51:26,369
Zed's dead.

1876
01:51:41,635 --> 01:51:43,679
Yes, you did, Brett!

1877
01:51:43,721 --> 01:51:45,765
- You tried to fuck him.
- No.

1878
01:51:45,765 --> 01:51:47,434
And Marsellus Wallace
don't like to be fucked...

1879
01:51:47,476 --> 01:51:50,396
by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

1880
01:51:50,438 --> 01:51:51,814
Oh, God, please.
I don't want to die.

1881
01:51:51,856 --> 01:51:53,107
You read the Bible, Brett?

1882
01:51:53,149 --> 01:51:54,525
Yes!

1883
01:51:54,567 --> 01:51:56,903
Well, there's
this passage I got memorized.

1884
01:51:56,944 --> 01:51:58,905
It sort of fits the occasion.

1885
01:51:58,947 --> 01:52:02,409
"Ezekiel" 25: 17.

1886
01:52:02,451 --> 01:52:04,578
"The path of
the righteous man...

1887
01:52:04,620 --> 01:52:06,830
"is beset on all sides...

1888
01:52:06,872 --> 01:52:08,874
"by the inequities
of the selfish...

1889

"and the tyranny of evil men.

1890
01:52:12,086 --> 01:52:13,755

01:52:13,797 --> 01:52:17,009

1901
01:52:40,452 --> 01:52:43,831
"when I lay My vengeance
upon thee."

1902
01:52:43,872 --> 01:52:45,333
Uhh!

1903
01:52:46,417 --> 01:52:48,586
Aah!

1904
01:52:51,882 --> 01:52:54,594
I'm fucked. I'm fucked.

1905
01:52:54,635 --> 01:52:56,846
Is he a friend of yours?

1906
01:52:56,888 --> 01:52:59,724
Oh, Vincent, Marvin.
Marvin, Vincent.

1907
01:52:59,765 --> 01:53:00,975
Better tell him
to shut the fuck up.

1908
01:53:00,975 --> 01:53:02,477
He's getting on my nerves.

1909
01:53:02,519 --> 01:53:04,771
Marvin. Marvin!

1910
01:53:04,813 --> 01:53:06,649
I'd knock that shit off
if I was you.

1911
01:53:07,692 --> 01:53:10,778
Die, you motherfuckers! Die!

1912
01:53:39,143 --> 01:53:42,313
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
somebody was in the bathroom?

1913
01:53:42,355 --> 01:53:43,815
Slip your mind?

1914
01:53:43,857 --> 01:53:47,403
You forget someone was in there
with a goddamn hand-cannon?

1915
01:53:47,444 --> 01:53:49,446
You see the size
of that gun he fired at us?

1916
01:53:49,488 --> 01:53:51,949
It was bigger than him.

1917
01:53:56,371 --> 01:53:58,999
We should be fucking dead, man.

1918
01:53:59,041 --> 01:54:00,959
I know. We was lucky.

1919
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:04,087
No, no, no, no.
That shit wasn't luck.

1920
01:54:04,129 --> 01:54:05,464
Yeah, maybe.

1921
01:54:05,506 --> 01:54:08,384
This was divine intervention.

1922
01:54:08,426 --> 01:54:10,387
You know what
divine intervention is?

1923
01:54:16,894 --> 01:54:18,730
I think so.

1924
01:54:18,772 --> 01:54:20,148
That means that God
came down from Heaven...

1925
01:54:20,190 --> 01:54:21,608
and stopped the bullets.

1926
01:54:21,650 --> 01:54:24,153
That's right.
That's exactly what it means.

1927
01:54:24,195 --> 01:54:25,446
God came down from Heaven...

1928
01:54:25,488 --> 01:54:27,239
and stopped
these motherfucking bullets.

1929
01:54:28,449 --> 01:54:30,451
I think it's time for us
to leave, Jules.

1930
01:54:30,493 --> 01:54:32,871
Don't do that. Don't
fucking blow this shit off.

1931
01:54:32,912 --> 01:54:35,123
What just happened here
was a fucking miracle.

1932
01:54:35,165 --> 01:54:36,959
Chill, Jules.
This shit happens.

1933
01:54:37,001 --> 01:54:39,795
Wrong. Wrong.
This shit doesn't just happen.

1934
01:54:39,836 --> 01:54:42,006
Do you want to continue
this theological discussion...

1935
01:54:42,047 --> 01:54:45,635
in a car or in a jailhouse
with the cops?

1936
01:54:45,677 --> 01:54:47,512
We should be fucking dead,
my friend.

1937
01:54:47,554 --> 01:54:50,474
What happened here
was a miracle...

1938
01:54:50,516 --> 01:54:52,809
and I want you to fucking
acknowledge it.

1939
01:54:52,851 --> 01:54:56,063
All right, it was a miracle.

1940
01:54:56,105 --> 01:54:57,607
Can we go now?

1941
01:55:04,781 --> 01:55:06,408
Let's go, nigger. Come on.

1942
01:55:06,450 --> 01:55:07,951
Shit.

1943
01:55:10,871 --> 01:55:12,373
You ever seen
that show "Cops"?

1944
01:55:12,415 --> 01:55:14,543
I was watching it one time,
and there was this cop on...

1945
01:55:14,584 --> 01:55:16,295
and he was talking
about this gunfight...

1946
01:55:16,336 --> 01:55:18,338
he had in a hallway
with this guy, right?

1947
01:55:18,379 --> 01:55:20,340
And he just unloaded
on this guy...

1948
01:55:20,382 --> 01:55:22,217
and nothing happened.
He didn't hit nothing.

1949
01:55:22,259 --> 01:55:24,762
OK? It was just him
and this guy.

1950
01:55:24,804 --> 01:55:26,472
I mean, you know...

1951
01:55:26,514 --> 01:55:28,600
it's freaky, but it happens.

1952
01:55:28,642 --> 01:55:31,185
You want to play blind man,
go walk with the shepherd...

1953
01:55:31,227 --> 01:55:33,605
but me, my eyes
are wide fucking open.

1954
01:55:33,647 --> 01:55:35,399
What the fuck does that mean?

1955
01:55:35,441 --> 01:55:37,234
It means that's it for me.

1956
01:55:37,234 --> 01:55:39,404
From here on in,
you can consider my ass retired.

1957
01:55:39,445 --> 01:55:41,281
- Jesus Christ.
- Don't blaspheme.

1958
01:55:41,323 --> 01:55:43,116
- God damn it.
- I said don't do that.

1959
01:55:43,158 --> 01:55:44,785
Why are you fucking
freaking out on us?

1960
01:55:44,827 --> 01:55:46,746
Look, I'm telling
Marsellus today.

1961
01:55:46,787 --> 01:55:47,914
I'm through.

1962
01:55:47,955 --> 01:55:49,499
Why don't you tell him
at the same time why?

1963
01:55:49,541 --> 01:55:50,834
Don't worry. I will.

1964
01:55:50,876 --> 01:55:52,085
Yeah,
and I'll bet you $10,000...

1965
01:55:52,127 --> 01:55:53,253
he laughs his ass off.

1966
01:55:53,295 --> 01:55:54,964
I don't give a damn
if he does.

1967
01:55:55,006 --> 01:55:58,926
Marvin, what do you make
of all this?

1968
01:55:58,968 --> 01:56:00,678
Man, I don't even
have an opinion.

1969
01:56:00,678 --> 01:56:02,347
You got to have an opinion.

1970
01:56:02,388 --> 01:56:04,933
Do you think that God came down
from Heaven and stopped...

1971
01:56:06,185 --> 01:56:09,187
What the fuck's happening?
Oh, shit, man!

1972
01:56:09,229 --> 01:56:10,606
Oh, man,
I shot Marvin in the face.

1973
01:56:10,647 --> 01:56:11,982
Why the fuck did you do that?

1974
01:56:12,024 --> 01:56:13,442
Well, I didn't mean to do it.
It was an accident.

1975
01:56:13,442 --> 01:56:16,571
Oh, man, I've seen some
crazy-ass shit in my time...

1976
01:56:16,613 --> 01:56:18,031
Chill out, man.
I told you it was an accident.

1977
01:56:18,073 --> 01:56:19,783
You probably... You went over
a bump or something.

1978
01:56:19,783 --> 01:56:21,493
Hey, the car didn't hit
no motherfucking bump.

1979
01:56:21,493 --> 01:56:24,079
Hey, look, man, I didn't mean
to shoot the son of a bitch.

1980
01:56:24,079 --> 01:56:25,497
The gun went off.
I don't know why.

1981
01:56:25,539 --> 01:56:26,999
Well, look at
this fucking mess, man!

1982
01:56:27,041 --> 01:56:28,668
We're on a city street
in broad daylight.

1983
01:56:28,710 --> 01:56:29,669
I can't believe it, man.

1984
01:56:29,711 --> 01:56:30,921
Well, believe it now,
motherfucker.

1985
01:56:30,921 --> 01:56:32,130
We got to get this car
off the road.

1986
01:56:32,172 --> 01:56:33,549
You know,
cops tend to notice shit...

1987
01:56:33,590 --> 01:56:35,717
like you're driving a car
drenched in fucking blood.

1988
01:56:35,759 --> 01:56:37,260
Just take it
to a friendly place, that's all.

1989
01:56:37,302 --> 01:56:38,554
This is the Valley, Vincent.

1990
01:56:38,595 --> 01:56:39,847
Marsellus ain't got
no friendly places.

1991
01:56:39,889 --> 01:56:42,058
Jules, this ain't
my fucking town, man!

1992
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:44,686
- Shit!
- What you doing?

1993
01:56:44,728 --> 01:56:46,104
I'm calling my partner
in Toluca Lake.

1994
01:56:46,146 --> 01:56:47,605
Where's Toluca Lake?

1995
01:56:47,647 --> 01:56:49,566
It's just over the hill here,
over by Burbank Studios.

1996
01:56:49,608 --> 01:56:51,318
If Jimmie's ass ain't home...

1997
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:52,820
I don't know what the fuck
we going to do, man...

1998
01:56:52,861 --> 01:56:55,907
'cause I ain't got
no other partners in 818.

1999
01:56:55,948 --> 01:56:57,283
Jimmie, yo,
how you doing, man?

2000
01:56:57,283 --> 01:56:59,744
It's Jules.
Just listen up, man.

2001
01:56:59,785 --> 01:57:01,788
Me and my homeboy are in
some serious fucking shit, man.

2002
01:57:01,829 --> 01:57:03,707
We're in a car, and we got
to get off the road pronto.

2003
01:57:03,748 --> 01:57:05,918
I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.

2004
01:57:07,336 --> 01:57:08,921
We got to be
real fucking delicate...

2005
01:57:08,963 --> 01:57:10,423
with this Jimmie situation.

2006
01:57:10,465 --> 01:57:12,884
He's one remark away from
kicking our asses out the door.

2007
01:57:12,884 --> 01:57:14,011
If he does, what do we do?

2008
01:57:14,052 --> 01:57:16,722
We ain't leaving
till we made a couple calls...

2009
01:57:16,764 --> 01:57:18,307
but I don't want it
to reach that pitch.

2010
01:57:18,349 --> 01:57:19,350
Jimmie's a friend.

2011
01:57:19,434 --> 01:57:20,560
You don't come
into your friend's house...

2012
01:57:20,602 --> 01:57:22,020
and start telling him
what's what.

2013
01:57:22,062 --> 01:57:24,023
Just tell him not
to be abusive, that's all.

2014
01:57:24,064 --> 01:57:27,109
He kind of freaked out
back there when he saw Marvin.

2015
01:57:27,150 --> 01:57:28,277
Well, put yourself
in his position.

2016
01:57:28,318 --> 01:57:29,528
It's 8:00 in the morning.

2017
01:57:29,570 --> 01:57:31,990
He just woke up.
He wasn't expecting this shit.

2018
01:57:32,031 --> 01:57:34,910
Shit, we got to remember here
who's doing who a favor.

2019
01:57:34,910 --> 01:57:36,787
If that favor means
that I got to take shit...

2020
01:57:36,829 --> 01:57:39,456
then he can stick that favor
straight up his ass.

2021
01:57:39,497 --> 01:57:42,126
Nigger, what the fuck
did you just do to his towel?

2022
01:57:42,167 --> 01:57:43,252
I was drying my hands.

2023
01:57:43,294 --> 01:57:44,545
You're supposed
to wash them first.

2024
01:57:44,587 --> 01:57:45,755
You watched me wash them.

2025
01:57:45,797 --> 01:57:47,215
I watched you get them wet.

2026
01:57:47,257 --> 01:57:49,843
I was washing them.
This shit's hard to get off.

2027
01:57:49,885 --> 01:57:51,845
Maybe if he had Lava,
I could've done a better job.

2028
01:57:51,886 --> 01:57:53,346
I used the same
fucking soap you did...

2029
01:57:53,388 --> 01:57:56,350
and the towel didn't look like
no goddamn maxipad.

2030
01:57:56,392 --> 01:57:58,895
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this?

2031
01:57:58,936 --> 01:58:01,106
It's shit like this
that'll bring this situation...

2032
01:58:01,147 --> 01:58:03,149
to a head, man.

2033
01:58:04,317 --> 01:58:05,985
Look...

2034
01:58:06,027 --> 01:58:07,738
I ain't threatening you
with nothing, all right?

2035
01:58:07,779 --> 01:58:09,698
You know I respect you
and all...

2036
01:58:09,698 --> 01:58:12,285
but just don't put me
in this position, all right?

2037
01:58:12,326 --> 01:58:15,205
All right. Fine. Fine.

2038
01:58:15,247 --> 01:58:18,082
Ask me nice like that,
no problem.

2039
01:58:18,124 --> 01:58:20,919
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.

2040
01:58:22,838 --> 01:58:25,633
Mmm. Goddamn, Jimmie.

2041
01:58:25,675 --> 01:58:27,635
This is some
serious gourmet shit.

2042
01:58:27,677 --> 01:58:29,595
Me and Vincent
would've been satisfied...

2043
01:58:29,637 --> 01:58:32,599
with some freeze-dried
Taster's Choice, right?

2044
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:36,395
Heh! And he springs this
serious gourmet shit on us.

2045
01:58:36,437 --> 01:58:37,479
What flavor is this?

2046
01:58:37,521 --> 01:58:38,856
Knock it off, Julie.

2047
01:58:38,856 --> 01:58:40,191
What?

2048
01:58:40,233 --> 01:58:43,111
I don't need you to tell me
how fucking good my coffee is.

2049
01:58:43,153 --> 01:58:45,322
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

2050
01:58:45,364 --> 01:58:47,533
When Bonnie goes shopping,
she buys shit.

2051
01:58:47,575 --> 01:58:49,244
I buy the gourmet
expensive stuff...

2052
01:58:49,285 --> 01:58:51,371
because when I drink it,
I want to taste it.

2053
01:58:51,413 --> 01:58:53,040
But you know what's
on my mind right now?

2054
01:58:53,081 --> 01:58:55,333
It ain't the coffee
in my kitchen.

2055
01:58:55,375 --> 01:58:57,419
It's the dead nigger
in my garage.

2056
01:58:57,461 --> 01:58:59,254
Oh, Jimmie,
don't even worry about it.

2057
01:58:59,296 --> 01:59:01,632
I don't think about anything.
I want to ask you a question.

2058
01:59:01,674 --> 01:59:03,176
When you came pulling in here...

2059
01:59:03,218 --> 01:59:04,678
did you notice a sign
out in the front of my house...

2060
01:59:04,678 --> 01:59:06,179
that said
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

2061
01:59:06,263 --> 01:59:08,056
Jimmie, you know
I didn't see no shit...

2062
01:59:08,097 --> 01:59:09,891
Did you notice a sign
in the front of my house...

2063
01:59:09,891 --> 01:59:11,727
that said
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

2064
01:59:11,768 --> 01:59:14,981
No. I didn't.

2065
01:59:14,981 --> 01:59:16,316
You know why
you didn't see that sign?

2066
01:59:16,357 --> 01:59:17,525
Why?

2067
01:59:17,567 --> 01:59:18,985
'Cause it ain't there...

2068
01:59:19,027 --> 01:59:22,113
'cause storing dead niggers
ain't my fucking business!

2069
01:59:22,155 --> 01:59:23,573
Jimmie, we're not going
to store the motherfucker.

2070
01:59:23,615 --> 01:59:27,036
Don't you fucking realize, man,
that if Bonnie comes home...

2071
01:59:27,077 --> 01:59:29,747
and finds a body in her house,
I'm going to get divorced?

2072
01:59:29,789 --> 01:59:31,458
No marriage counselor,
no trial separation.

2073
01:59:31,499 --> 01:59:33,542
I'm going to get
fucking divorced, OK?

2074
01:59:33,584 --> 01:59:36,421
And I don't want
to get fucking divorced.

2075
01:59:36,463 --> 01:59:39,049
Now, man, you know, fuck,
I want to help you...

2076
01:59:39,091 --> 01:59:41,469
but I don't want to lose
my wife doing it, all right?

2077
01:59:41,469 --> 01:59:43,638
Jimmie, she ain't
going to leave you.

2078
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:45,681
Don't fucking "Jimmie" me,
Jules!

2079
01:59:45,723 --> 01:59:48,101
OK?
Don't fucking "Jimmie" me.

2080
01:59:48,142 --> 01:59:50,478
There's nothing you're gonna say
that's gonna make me forget...

2081
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:52,731
that I love my wife, is there?

2082
01:59:54,775 --> 01:59:56,068
Look, you know...

2083
01:59:56,110 --> 01:59:59,780
she comes home from work
in about an hour and a half.

2084
01:59:59,822 --> 02:00:02,200
Graveyard shift
at the hospital.

2085
02:00:02,241 --> 02:00:04,369
You got to make
some phone calls?

2086
02:00:04,411 --> 02:00:06,038
You got to call some people?

2087
02:00:06,079 --> 02:00:08,415
Well, then do it, and get
the fuck out of my house...

2088
02:00:08,457 --> 02:00:10,333
before she gets here.

2089
02:00:10,376 --> 02:00:11,419
That's Kool and the Gang.

2090
02:00:11,503 --> 02:00:12,837
We don't want
to fuck your shit up.

2091
02:00:12,879 --> 02:00:15,799
I want to call my people,
get them to bring us in.

2092
02:00:15,841 --> 02:00:18,845
You're fucking my shit up
right now!

2093
02:00:18,886 --> 02:00:21,723
You'll fuck my shit up big time
if Bonnie comes home.

2094
02:00:21,765 --> 02:00:23,307
So just do me that favor,
all right?

2095
02:00:23,349 --> 02:00:25,518
The phone is in my bedroom.
I suggest you get going.

2096
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:28,772
Well, say she comes home.

2097
02:00:28,814 --> 02:00:32,568
What do you think she'll do?

2098
02:00:32,610 --> 02:00:35,071
Oh, no fucking shit,
she'll freak.

2099
02:00:35,113 --> 02:00:37,198
That ain't no kind of answer.

2100
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:38,575
I mean, you know, I don't.

2101
02:00:38,616 --> 02:00:40,410
How much?
A lot or a little?

2102
02:00:40,452 --> 02:00:43,664
You got to appreciate
what an explosive element...

2103
02:00:43,664 --> 02:00:45,333
this Bonnie situation is.

2104
02:00:45,374 --> 02:00:47,669
I mean, if she comes
home from a hard day's work...

2105
02:00:47,710 --> 02:00:49,128
and finds a bunch
of gangsters in her kitchen...

2106
02:00:49,170 --> 02:00:51,214
doing a bunch
of gangster shit...

2107
02:00:51,255 --> 02:00:54,676
there ain't no telling
what she's liable to do.

2108
02:00:56,595 --> 02:00:59,265
Yeah, I've grasped that, Jules.

2109
02:00:59,307 --> 02:01:01,267
All I'm doing
is contemplating the "ifs."

2110
02:01:01,309 --> 02:01:03,602
I don't want to hear about
no motherfucking "ifs."

2111
02:01:03,644 --> 02:01:05,104
All I want to hear
from your ass is...

2112
02:01:05,146 --> 02:01:07,899
"You ain't got no problem.
I'm on the motherfucker.

2113
02:01:07,941 --> 02:01:09,359
"Go back in there,
chill them niggers out...

2114
02:01:09,401 --> 02:01:12,488
"and wait for the cavalry,
which will be coming directly."

2115
02:01:12,530 --> 02:01:15,908
You ain't
got no problem, Jules.

2116
02:01:15,950 --> 02:01:18,035
I'm on the motherfucker.

2117
02:01:18,077 --> 02:01:20,622
Go back in there
and chill them niggers out...

2118
02:01:20,705 --> 02:01:23,041
and wait for The Wolf,
who should be coming directly.

2119
02:01:24,418 --> 02:01:25,544
You're sending The Wolf?

2120
02:01:25,586 --> 02:01:27,796
Oh, you feel better,
motherfucker?

2121
02:01:27,838 --> 02:01:33,344
Shit, negro,
that's all you had to say.

2122
02:01:33,386 --> 02:01:36,723
Is she the hysterical type?

2123
02:01:36,765 --> 02:01:38,767
When is she due?

2124
02:01:40,144 --> 02:01:42,021
Mm-hmm.

2125
02:01:42,063 --> 02:01:45,067
Give me the principals'
names again.

2126
02:01:47,027 --> 02:01:49,405
Jules.

2127
02:01:49,447 --> 02:01:50,532
Mm-hmm.

2128
02:01:50,573 --> 02:01:53,367
Vincent.

2129
02:01:57,247 --> 02:01:58,999
Jimmie.

2130
02:02:00,709 --> 02:02:02,587
Bonnie.

2131
02:02:02,628 --> 02:02:03,630
Mm-hmm.

2132
02:02:07,925 --> 02:02:09,177
It's thirty minutes away.

2133
02:02:09,219 --> 02:02:10,971
I'll be there in ten.

2134
02:02:28,073 --> 02:02:30,909
You're Jimmie, right?
This is your house?

2135
02:02:30,951 --> 02:02:31,910
Sure is.

2136
02:02:31,952 --> 02:02:34,664
I'm Winston Wolf.
I solve problems.

2137
02:02:34,705 --> 02:02:35,873
Good. We got one.

2138
02:02:35,915 --> 02:02:37,375
So I heard. May I come in?

2139
02:02:37,417 --> 02:02:39,544
Yeah, please do.

2140
02:02:39,586 --> 02:02:41,630
You must be Jules...

2141
02:02:41,672 --> 02:02:43,465
which would make you Vincent.

2142
02:02:43,507 --> 02:02:45,467
Let's get down
to brass tacks, gentlemen.

2143
02:02:45,509 --> 02:02:46,844
If I was informed correctly...

2144
02:02:46,886 --> 02:02:47,845
the clock is ticking,
is that right, Jimmie?

2145
02:02:47,845 --> 02:02:49,806
100%

2146
02:02:49,806 --> 02:02:51,558
Your wife Bonnie...

2147
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:53,393
comes home at 9:30 in the a.m.,
is that correct?

2148
02:02:53,435 --> 02:02:54,728
Uh-huh.

2149
02:02:54,770 --> 02:02:57,606
I was led to believe if she
comes home and finds us here...

2150
02:02:57,647 --> 02:02:59,400
she wouldn't appreciate it
none too much?

2151
02:02:59,441 --> 02:03:00,860
She wouldn't at that.

2152
02:03:00,901 --> 02:03:03,738
That gives us forty minutes
to get the fuck out of Dodge...

2153
02:03:03,780 --> 02:03:06,992
which, if you do what I say
when I say it, should be plenty.

2154
02:03:07,034 --> 02:03:09,370
Now, you got a corpse
in a car...

2155
02:03:09,412 --> 02:03:11,706
minus a head in a garage.
Take me to it.

2156
02:03:19,423 --> 02:03:21,759
- Jimmie?
- Uh-huh.

2157
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:23,177
Do me a favor, will you?

2158
02:03:23,219 --> 02:03:24,470
I thought I smelled
some coffee back there.

2159
02:03:24,512 --> 02:03:26,806
Would you make me a cup?

2160
02:03:26,848 --> 02:03:28,475
Yeah, sure.

2161
02:03:30,352 --> 02:03:32,813
Oh, how do you take it?

2162
02:03:32,855 --> 02:03:35,816
Lots of cream,
lots of sugar.

2163
02:03:38,110 --> 02:03:39,571
About the car... is there
anything I need to know?

2164
02:03:39,612 --> 02:03:41,907
Does it stall, smoke,
make a lot of noise?

2165
02:03:41,948 --> 02:03:43,575
Is there gas in it?
Anything?

2166
02:03:43,617 --> 02:03:46,454
Aside from how it looks,
the car is cool.

2167
02:03:46,496 --> 02:03:48,413
Positive? Don't get me
out there on the road...

2168
02:03:48,455 --> 02:03:50,124
I find out
the brake lights don't work.

2169
02:03:50,207 --> 02:03:53,753
Man, far as I know,
the motherfucker's tiptop.

2170
02:03:53,795 --> 02:03:55,756
Good enough.

2171
02:03:55,797 --> 02:03:57,633
Let's go back to the kitchen.

2172
02:04:03,389 --> 02:04:04,515
Here you go, Mr. Wolf.

2173
02:04:04,557 --> 02:04:06,059
Thank you, Jimmie.

2174
02:04:11,315 --> 02:04:12,816
Mmm.

2175
02:04:14,025 --> 02:04:15,694
OK, first thing...

2176
02:04:15,736 --> 02:04:18,364
you two, take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

2177
02:04:18,406 --> 02:04:21,201
Now, Jimmie, this looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

2178
02:04:21,242 --> 02:04:22,619
That would lead me to believe
that in the gar age...

2179
02:04:22,661 --> 02:04:24,997
or under the sink, you got
a bunch of cleaners and shit?

2180
02:04:25,039 --> 02:04:26,122
Yeah, Mr. Wolf.
Under the sink.

2181
02:04:26,164 --> 02:04:28,125
Good. What I need
you two fellas to do...

2182
02:04:28,166 --> 02:04:30,920
is take those cleaning products
and clean the inside of the car.

2183
02:04:30,961 --> 02:04:32,964
I'm talking fast, fast, fast.

2184
02:04:33,005 --> 02:04:34,424
Go in the back seat...

2185
02:04:34,424 --> 02:04:37,719
scoop up all those little
pieces of brain and skull.

2186
02:04:37,761 --> 02:04:39,805
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

2187
02:04:39,847 --> 02:04:42,141
Now, it don't need
to be spick-and-span.

2188
02:04:42,141 --> 02:04:45,228
You don't need to eat off it.
Just give it a good once over.

2189
02:04:45,312 --> 02:04:48,065
What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts.

2190
02:04:48,107 --> 02:04:49,567
The pools of blood
that have collected...

2191
02:04:49,609 --> 02:04:51,235
you got to soak that shit up.

2192
02:04:51,276 --> 02:04:54,447
Now, Jimmie, we need to r aid
your linen closet.

2193
02:04:54,488 --> 02:04:55,907
I need blankets.
I need comforters.

2194
02:04:55,949 --> 02:04:57,909
I need quilts.
I need bedspreads.

2195
02:04:57,993 --> 02:04:59,536
The thicker the better,
the darker the better.

2196
02:04:59,620 --> 02:05:01,539
No whites. Can't use 'em.

2197
02:05:01,580 --> 02:05:03,790
We need to camouflage
the interior of the car.

2198
02:05:03,832 --> 02:05:05,584
We're going to line
the front seat and back seat...

2199
02:05:05,584 --> 02:05:08,504
and the floorboards
with quilts and blankets.

2200
02:05:08,546 --> 02:05:11,257
So if a cop stops us and sticks
his big snout in the car...

2201
02:05:11,299 --> 02:05:12,884
the subterfuge won't last...

2202
02:05:12,926 --> 02:05:15,805
but at a glance, the car
will appear to be normal.

2203
02:05:15,846 --> 02:05:17,889
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

2204
02:05:17,931 --> 02:05:21,102
"Please" would be nice.

2205
02:05:21,143 --> 02:05:22,103
Come again?

2206
02:05:22,145 --> 02:05:24,147
I said
a "please" would be nice.

2207
02:05:26,066 --> 02:05:28,319
Get it straight, buster.
I'm not here to say "please."

2208
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:30,612
I'm here to tell you what to do.

2209
02:05:30,654 --> 02:05:33,532
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess...

2210
02:05:33,574 --> 02:05:36,995
you better fucking do it
and do it quick.

2211
02:05:36,995 --> 02:05:38,330
I'm here to help.

2212
02:05:38,371 --> 02:05:41,083
If my help is not appreciated,
lots of luck, gentlemen.

2213
02:05:41,125 --> 02:05:42,667
No, Mr. Wolf,
it ain't like that.

2214
02:05:42,667 --> 02:05:43,752
Your help is definitely
appreciated.

2215
02:05:43,793 --> 02:05:45,504
Mr. Wolf, listen.

2216
02:05:45,545 --> 02:05:47,965
I don't mean disrespect, OK?
I respect you.

2217
02:05:48,007 --> 02:05:50,385
I don't like people barking
orders at me, that's all.

2218
02:05:50,426 --> 02:05:53,305
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

2219
02:05:53,346 --> 02:05:55,264
I think fast, I talk fast...

2220
02:05:55,306 --> 02:05:58,393
and I need you guys to act fast
if you want out of this...

2221
02:05:58,435 --> 02:06:00,354
so pretty please
with sugar on top...

2222
02:06:00,354 --> 02:06:02,356
clean the fucking car.

2223
02:06:06,319 --> 02:06:07,905
Don't be looking at me
like that, all right?

2224
02:06:07,946 --> 02:06:10,408
I can feel your look.

2225
02:06:12,577 --> 02:06:14,996
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

2226
02:06:17,291 --> 02:06:18,834
Green.

2227
02:06:20,919 --> 02:06:23,923
Nothing except
for the mess inside.

2228
02:06:26,217 --> 02:06:28,386
Mmm, about twenty minutes.

2229
02:06:30,097 --> 02:06:32,057
Nobody who'll be missed.

2230
02:06:34,101 --> 02:06:37,605
You're a good man, Joe.
Thanks a bunch.

2231
02:06:37,646 --> 02:06:39,148
How we coming, Jimmie?

2232
02:06:39,190 --> 02:06:41,276
Pretty good.
I got it all here...

2233
02:06:41,317 --> 02:06:43,570
but, uh...

2234
02:06:43,612 --> 02:06:44,738
Mr. Wolf, you got to
understand something.

2235
02:06:44,780 --> 02:06:46,865
Winston, Jimmie, please.
Winston.

2236
02:06:46,906 --> 02:06:50,536
You got to understand
something now, Winston.

2237
02:06:50,578 --> 02:06:52,413
Uh, no, thank you.

2238
02:06:52,455 --> 02:06:55,709
This is our best linen here...

2239
02:06:55,750 --> 02:06:58,378
and it was a wedding present...

2240
02:06:58,419 --> 02:07:00,046
from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny...

2241
02:07:00,088 --> 02:07:01,465
and they're not with us anymore.

2242
02:07:01,506 --> 02:07:02,925
I really want
to help you guys out...

2243
02:07:02,966 --> 02:07:05,594
Let me ask you
a question, Jimmie...

2244
02:07:05,636 --> 02:07:06,596
if you don't mind.

2245
02:07:06,637 --> 02:07:10,183
No, please, go ahead.

2246
02:07:10,225 --> 02:07:13,603
Your Uncle Conrad
and Aunt Ginny...

2247
02:07:13,645 --> 02:07:15,939
were they millionaires?

2248
02:07:15,981 --> 02:07:17,691
No.

2249
02:07:17,733 --> 02:07:20,570
Well,
your Uncle Marsellus is...

2250
02:07:20,611 --> 02:07:24,031
and I'm positive
if Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

2251
02:07:24,031 --> 02:07:26,701
- Ginny.
- Ginny were here...

2252
02:07:26,743 --> 02:07:31,081
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set...

2253
02:07:31,123 --> 02:07:35,128
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

2254
02:07:38,131 --> 02:07:39,466
I like oak myself.

2255
02:07:39,508 --> 02:07:43,137
That's what I have
in my bedroom.

2256
02:07:43,179 --> 02:07:46,350
How about you, Jimmie?

2257
02:07:46,391 --> 02:07:48,394
You an oak man?

2258
02:07:49,394 --> 02:07:50,896
Oak's nice.

2259
02:07:57,403 --> 02:07:58,738
Oh, man.

2260
02:07:58,780 --> 02:08:01,074
I will never forgive
your ass for this shit.

2261
02:08:01,116 --> 02:08:02,867
This is some fucked-up
repugnant shit.

2262
02:08:02,909 --> 02:08:04,703
Jules, did you ever hear
the philosophy...

2263
02:08:04,745 --> 02:08:06,622
that once a man admits
that he is wrong...

2264
02:08:06,663 --> 02:08:09,792
that he is immediately
forgiven for all wrongdoings?

2265
02:08:09,834 --> 02:08:12,045
Get the fuck out my face
with that shit.

2266
02:08:12,087 --> 02:08:14,089
The motherfucker said that shit
never had to pick up...

2267
02:08:14,131 --> 02:08:16,508
itty-bitty pieces of skull
on account of your dumb ass.

2268
02:08:16,549 --> 02:08:17,926
I got a threshold, Jules.

2269
02:08:17,926 --> 02:08:19,928
I got a threshold
for the abuse that I will take.

2270
02:08:19,970 --> 02:08:21,680
Right now, I'm a fucking
race car, all right?

2271
02:08:21,722 --> 02:08:22,974
And you got me in the red.

2272
02:08:23,015 --> 02:08:25,602
I'm just saying
that it's fucking dangerous...

2273
02:08:25,644 --> 02:08:27,645
to have a race car
in the fucking red, that's all.

2274
02:08:27,645 --> 02:08:29,564
- I could blow.
- Oh, you ready to blow?

2275
02:08:29,606 --> 02:08:31,149
Yeah, I'm ready to blow.

2276
02:08:31,191 --> 02:08:34,236
I'm a mushroom cloud-laying
motherfucker, motherfucker.

2277
02:08:34,278 --> 02:08:36,906
Every time my fingers touch
brain, I'm "Superfly TNT."

2278
02:08:36,948 --> 02:08:39,284
I'm "The Guns of the Navarone."

2279
02:08:39,326 --> 02:08:41,536
In fact, what the fuck
am I doing in the back?

2280
02:08:41,577 --> 02:08:44,039
You the motherfucker
who should be on brain detail.

2281
02:08:44,080 --> 02:08:46,041
We fucking switching.
I'm washing the windows...

2282
02:08:46,083 --> 02:08:47,793
and you picking up
this nigger's skull.

2283
02:08:57,929 --> 02:08:59,473
Fine job, gentlemen.

2284
02:09:00,974 --> 02:09:02,852
We may get out of this yet.

2285
02:09:02,852 --> 02:09:05,480
I can't believe
this is the same car.

2286
02:09:05,522 --> 02:09:09,193
Let's not start sucking
each other's dicks quite yet.

2287
02:09:09,234 --> 02:09:10,694
Phase one is complete...
clean the car...

2288
02:09:10,694 --> 02:09:12,530
which moves us right
along to phase two...

2289
02:09:12,572 --> 02:09:14,032
clean you two.

2290
02:09:16,326 --> 02:09:18,245
Strip.

2291
02:09:18,287 --> 02:09:19,788
All the way?

2292
02:09:19,829 --> 02:09:22,082
To your bare ass.

2293
02:09:22,124 --> 02:09:23,709
Quickly, gentlemen.

2294
02:09:23,792 --> 02:09:25,336
We got about fifteen minutes...

2295
02:09:25,336 --> 02:09:28,423
before Jimmie's better half
pulls into the driveway.

2296
02:09:28,465 --> 02:09:30,801
Damn. This morning air
is some chilly shit.

2297
02:09:30,842 --> 02:09:32,844
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?

2298
02:09:32,844 --> 02:09:34,304
You know what you two
look like?

2299
02:09:34,346 --> 02:09:35,889
What?

2300
02:09:35,931 --> 02:09:37,683
Like a couple of guys who just
blew off somebody's head.

2301
02:09:39,226 --> 02:09:42,272
Stripping off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

2302
02:09:46,526 --> 02:09:48,528
Toss them in Jim's garbage bag.

2303
02:09:48,570 --> 02:09:50,113
Don't do nothing stupid...

2304
02:09:50,155 --> 02:09:52,408
like leaving this shit out front
for Otto the Garbageman...

2305
02:09:52,450 --> 02:09:53,409
you know what I'm saying?

2306
02:09:53,451 --> 02:09:55,411
Don't worry.
We're taking it with us.

2307
02:09:55,453 --> 02:09:57,830
Jim, the soap.

2308
02:09:59,207 --> 02:10:01,209
- Vincent.
- OK, gentlemen...

2309
02:10:01,251 --> 02:10:03,754
you've both been
to County before I'm sure.

2310
02:10:03,796 --> 02:10:04,755
Here it comes.

2311
02:10:04,838 --> 02:10:07,383
Goddamn!
The water's fucking cold.

2312
02:10:07,425 --> 02:10:09,219
Better you
than me, gentlemen.

2313
02:10:09,260 --> 02:10:11,470
Ha ha ha!

2314
02:10:11,512 --> 02:10:13,097
Don't be afraid
of the soap.

2315
02:10:13,139 --> 02:10:14,098
Spread it around.

2316
02:10:14,098 --> 02:10:15,058
Get him up there
a little bit.

2317
02:10:15,100 --> 02:10:17,227
Vincent's hair.

2318
02:10:17,311 --> 02:10:19,063
Come on, do it,
God damn it! Do it!

2319
02:10:19,063 --> 02:10:21,149
Uh, uh...

2320
02:10:21,190 --> 02:10:22,691
Towel 'em.

2321
02:10:33,788 --> 02:10:36,875
They're dry enough.
Toss them their clothes.

2322
02:10:38,835 --> 02:10:40,045
Perfect.

2323
02:10:40,087 --> 02:10:43,675
Perfect. We couldn't
have planned this better.

2324
02:10:43,716 --> 02:10:46,052
You guys look like...

2325
02:10:46,094 --> 02:10:48,304
What do they look like, Jimmie?

2326
02:10:48,346 --> 02:10:49,347
Dorks.

2327
02:10:50,515 --> 02:10:51,641
They look like
a couple of dorks.

2328
02:10:52,768 --> 02:10:55,271
Ha ha ha. They're your clothes,
motherfucker.

2329
02:10:55,312 --> 02:10:56,480
Come on, gentlemen.

2330
02:10:56,522 --> 02:10:58,107
We're laughing our way
right into prison.

2331
02:10:58,149 --> 02:11:00,110
Don't make me beg.

2332
02:11:03,238 --> 02:11:06,617
OK, gentlemen, let's get
our rules of the road straight.

2333
02:11:06,658 --> 02:11:09,161
We're going to a place called
Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

2334
02:11:09,203 --> 02:11:11,789
Now, Monster Joe
and his daughter Raquel...

2335
02:11:11,789 --> 02:11:13,249
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

2336
02:11:13,290 --> 02:11:15,418
The place is North Hollywood...

2337
02:11:15,460 --> 02:11:19,256
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be going up Hollywood Way.

2338
02:11:19,297 --> 02:11:22,718
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

2339
02:11:24,220 --> 02:11:26,055
Vincent, you follow in my Acura.

2340
02:11:26,096 --> 02:11:30,226
Now, if we come across the path
of any John Q. Laws...

2341
02:11:30,310 --> 02:11:32,103
nobody does a fucking thing
till I do something.

2342
02:11:32,145 --> 02:11:33,230
- Right.
- What did I say?

2343
02:11:34,440 --> 02:11:36,108
Don't do shit unless...

2344
02:11:36,150 --> 02:11:38,528
- Unless what?
- Unless you do it first.

2345
02:11:38,569 --> 02:11:40,988
Spoken like a true prodigy.

2346
02:11:40,988 --> 02:11:42,114
How about you, Lash LaRue?

2347
02:11:42,156 --> 02:11:44,659
Can you keep your spurs
from jingling and jangling?

2348
02:11:44,701 --> 02:11:46,203
Mr. Wolf, look,
the gun went off.

2349
02:11:46,244 --> 02:11:47,496
I don't why.

2350
02:11:47,538 --> 02:11:48,706
I'm cool. I promise you.

2351
02:11:48,747 --> 02:11:52,209
Fair enough. Now, I drive
real fucking fast, so keep up.

2352
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:54,503
If I get my car back
any different than I gave it...

2353
02:11:54,545 --> 02:11:57,256
Monster Joe's going to be
disposing of two bodies.

2354
02:12:00,093 --> 02:12:02,805
Out of my way, Rex.

2355
02:12:04,432 --> 02:12:07,060
- We cool?
- Like it never happened.

2356
02:12:07,102 --> 02:12:08,103
All right.

2357
02:12:08,144 --> 02:12:10,773
Boys, this is Raquel.

2358
02:12:10,814 --> 02:12:13,734
Someday, all this will be hers.

2359
02:12:13,776 --> 02:12:16,279
Hi. So, what's with the outfits?

2360
02:12:16,321 --> 02:12:18,990
You guys going to
a volleyball game or something?

2361
02:12:21,159 --> 02:12:23,120
I'm taking my lady
out for breakfast.

2362
02:12:23,161 --> 02:12:25,122
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?

2363
02:12:25,164 --> 02:12:26,582
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.

2364
02:12:26,624 --> 02:12:29,043
It's... it's your future.

2365
02:12:29,085 --> 02:12:33,047
I... I see a... a cab ride.

2366
02:12:33,089 --> 02:12:35,050
Move out of the sticks, fellas.

2367
02:12:35,091 --> 02:12:36,259
Say good night, Raquel.

2368
02:12:36,301 --> 02:12:37,553
Good night, Raquel.

2369
02:12:37,594 --> 02:12:39,054
I'll see you guys around.

2370
02:12:39,138 --> 02:12:40,389
Stay out of trouble,
you crazy kids.

2371
02:12:40,431 --> 02:12:42,766
Mr. Wolf,
I just want to tell you...

2372
02:12:42,808 --> 02:12:44,769
it was a real pleasure
watching you work.

2373
02:12:44,810 --> 02:12:48,899
Yeah, really, and thank you
very much, Mr. Wolf.

2374
02:12:48,940 --> 02:12:50,400
Call me Winston.

2375
02:12:52,069 --> 02:12:54,071
You see that, young lady?
Respect.

2376
02:12:55,155 --> 02:12:57,449
Respect for one's elders
shows character.

2377
02:12:57,491 --> 02:12:59,577
I have character.

2378
02:12:59,619 --> 02:13:01,329
Because you are a character...

2379
02:13:01,371 --> 02:13:03,331
doesn't mean
that you have character.

2380
02:13:11,465 --> 02:13:13,426
Want to share a cab?

2381
02:13:13,468 --> 02:13:14,844
I could go for some breakfast.

2382
02:13:14,886 --> 02:13:17,347
Feel like having breakfast
with me?

2383
02:13:17,389 --> 02:13:18,891
Cool.

2384
02:13:24,063 --> 02:13:27,066
I don't know why,
I thought he'd be European...

2385
02:13:27,108 --> 02:13:29,194
Yo, man, he's about as European
as English Bob.

2386
02:13:29,235 --> 02:13:30,612
I know that now, but...

2387
02:13:30,654 --> 02:13:32,656
- Was he cool or what?
- Thank you.

2388
02:13:32,698 --> 02:13:35,827
Totally fucking cool,
in control.

2389
02:13:35,868 --> 02:13:38,788
Didn't even really get pissed
when you were fucking with him.

2390
02:13:38,830 --> 02:13:40,457
I was amazed.

2391
02:13:41,500 --> 02:13:42,793
Want some bacon?

2392
02:13:42,835 --> 02:13:44,545
No, man. I don't eat pork.

2393
02:13:44,587 --> 02:13:45,547
Are you Jewish?

2394
02:13:45,588 --> 02:13:46,714
Naw, I ain't Jewish.

2395
02:13:46,755 --> 02:13:48,174
I just don't dig on swine,
that's all.

2396
02:13:48,215 --> 02:13:49,842
Why not?

2397
02:13:49,884 --> 02:13:52,387
Pigs are filthy animals.
I don't eat filthy animals.

2398
02:13:52,429 --> 02:13:54,890
Yeah, but bacon tastes good.

2399
02:13:54,974 --> 02:13:56,267
Pork chops taste good.

2400
02:13:56,308 --> 02:13:58,478
Hey, a sewer rat
may taste like pumpkin pie...

2401
02:13:58,519 --> 02:13:59,770
but I'd never know...

2402
02:13:59,812 --> 02:14:02,523
'cause I wouldn't eat
the filthy motherfuckers.

2403
02:14:02,565 --> 02:14:04,442
Pigs sleep and root in shit.

2404
02:14:04,442 --> 02:14:05,735
That's a filthy animal.

2405
02:14:05,777 --> 02:14:07,279
I ain't eating nothing
that ain't got sense enough...

2406
02:14:07,279 --> 02:14:08,739
to disregard its own feces.

2407
02:14:08,781 --> 02:14:11,492
How about a dog?
A dog eats his own feces.

2408
02:14:11,533 --> 02:14:14,036
I don't eat dog, either.

2409
02:14:14,078 --> 02:14:17,457
But do you consider a dog
to be a filthy animal?

2410
02:14:17,498 --> 02:14:19,501
I wouldn't go so far
as to call a dog filthy...

2411
02:14:19,543 --> 02:14:21,712
but they're definitely dirty.

2412
02:14:21,754 --> 02:14:25,132
But a dog's got personality.
Personality goes a long way.

2413
02:14:25,132 --> 02:14:26,800
Ah, so by that rationale...

2414
02:14:26,842 --> 02:14:28,385
if a pig had
a better personality...

2415
02:14:28,427 --> 02:14:30,346
he would cease to be
a filthy animal.

2416
02:14:30,388 --> 02:14:31,514
Is that true?

2417
02:14:31,556 --> 02:14:33,934
We'd have to be talking about
one charming motherfucking pig.

2418
02:14:35,018 --> 02:14:36,270
He'd have to be ten times
more charming...

2419
02:14:36,312 --> 02:14:38,313
than Arnold on "Green Acres,"
you know what I'm saying?

2420
02:14:44,195 --> 02:14:46,114
Oh, man, that's good.

2421
02:14:46,156 --> 02:14:49,702
That's good, man.
You're starting to lighten up.

2422
02:14:49,743 --> 02:14:52,788
You been sitting there
all serious and shit.

2423
02:14:52,829 --> 02:14:54,289
Man, I've just been
sitting here thinking.

2424
02:14:54,331 --> 02:14:55,499
About what?

2425
02:14:55,541 --> 02:14:56,834
About the miracle we witnessed.

2426
02:14:56,876 --> 02:14:58,628
The miracle you witnessed.

2427
02:14:58,670 --> 02:15:00,213
I witnessed a freak occurrence.

2428
02:15:00,255 --> 02:15:01,632
What is a miracle, Vincent?

2429
02:15:03,801 --> 02:15:05,094
An act of God.

2430
02:15:05,136 --> 02:15:08,598
And what's an act of God?

2431
02:15:10,434 --> 02:15:12,228
When, um...

2432
02:15:12,269 --> 02:15:14,021
God makes the impossible
possible.

2433
02:15:15,064 --> 02:15:18,859
But this morning
I don't think qualifies.

2434
02:15:18,859 --> 02:15:19,819
Hey, Vincent...

2435
02:15:19,861 --> 02:15:22,072
Don't you see?
That shit don't matter.

2436
02:15:22,113 --> 02:15:23,615
You're judging this shit
the wrong way.

2437
02:15:23,657 --> 02:15:26,076
I mean, it could be
God stopped the bullets...

2438
02:15:26,118 --> 02:15:29,329
or he changed Coke to Pepsi,
he found my fucking car keys.

2439
02:15:29,371 --> 02:15:31,665
You don't judge shit like this
based on merit.

2440
02:15:31,707 --> 02:15:33,626
Now, whether or not
what we experienced...

2441
02:15:33,668 --> 02:15:36,171
was an "According to Hoyle"
miracle...

2442
02:15:36,213 --> 02:15:37,547
is insignificant...

2443
02:15:37,589 --> 02:15:41,843
but what is significant
is I felt the touch of God.

2444
02:15:41,885 --> 02:15:43,262
God got involved.

2445
02:15:43,262 --> 02:15:45,055
But why?

2446
02:15:45,097 --> 02:15:46,849
Well, that's what's
fucking with me.

2447
02:15:46,891 --> 02:15:49,436
I don't know why,
but I can't go back to sleep.

2448
02:15:49,477 --> 02:15:51,980
You're serious?

2449
02:15:52,022 --> 02:15:53,190
You're really thinking
about quitting?

2450
02:15:53,232 --> 02:15:54,941
- The life?
Yeah.

2451
02:15:54,983 --> 02:15:55,942
Most definitely.

2452
02:15:55,984 --> 02:15:57,319
Fuck.

2453
02:15:57,361 --> 02:15:59,363
What you going to do, then?

2454
02:16:00,782 --> 02:16:05,037
Well, that's what I've been
sitting here contemplating.

2455
02:16:05,078 --> 02:16:08,748
First, I'm going to deliver
this case to Marsellus.

2456
02:16:08,790 --> 02:16:11,752
Then, basically, I'm just
going to walk the earth.

2457
02:16:11,794 --> 02:16:13,254
What you mean, walk the earth?

2458
02:16:13,254 --> 02:16:15,506
You know,
like Caine in "Kung Fu."

2459
02:16:15,506 --> 02:16:18,302
Walk from place to place,
meet people, get in adventures.

2460
02:16:18,343 --> 02:16:20,637
And how long do you intend
to walk the earth?

2461
02:16:20,678 --> 02:16:22,806
Till God puts me
where he wants me to be.

2462
02:16:22,848 --> 02:16:24,016
And what if he don't do that?

2463
02:16:24,057 --> 02:16:26,477
If it takes forever,
then I'll walk forever.

2464
02:16:26,519 --> 02:16:29,022
So you decided to be a bum?

2465
02:16:29,063 --> 02:16:32,734
I'll just be Jules, Vincent...
no more, no less.

2466
02:16:32,734 --> 02:16:34,737
No, Jules.
You decided to be a bum...

2467
02:16:34,779 --> 02:16:36,864
Just like all those
pieces of shit out there...

2468
02:16:36,906 --> 02:16:38,324
who beg for change...

2469
02:16:38,366 --> 02:16:41,119
who sleep in garbage bins,
eat what I throw away.

2470
02:16:41,161 --> 02:16:42,788
They got a name
for that, Jules.

2471
02:16:42,788 --> 02:16:44,373
It's called a bum.

2472
02:16:44,415 --> 02:16:46,917
And without a job, a residence,
or legal tender...

2473
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:48,210
that's what you're
going to be, man.

2474
02:16:48,252 --> 02:16:49,879
You're going
to be a fucking bum.

2475
02:16:49,921 --> 02:16:52,883
Look, my friend, this is just
where you and I differ.

2476
02:16:52,924 --> 02:16:54,593
Garçon!

2477
02:16:54,635 --> 02:16:55,803
Coffee!

2478
02:16:55,844 --> 02:16:59,723
What happened this morning,
man, I agree it was peculiar.

2479
02:16:59,765 --> 02:17:00,724
Garçon means boy.

2480
02:17:00,766 --> 02:17:02,143
But water into wine. I...

2481
02:17:02,184 --> 02:17:03,561
All shapes and sizes, Vincent.

2482
02:17:03,603 --> 02:17:05,647
Don't fucking talk to me
that way, man.

2483
02:17:05,730 --> 02:17:06,982
If my answers
frighten you, Vincent...

2484
02:17:07,023 --> 02:17:09,401
then you should cease
asking scary questions.

2485
02:17:12,696 --> 02:17:15,616
I'm going to take a shit.

2486
02:17:18,411 --> 02:17:19,663
Let me ask you something.

2487
02:17:19,704 --> 02:17:21,873
When did you
make this decision?

2488
02:17:21,873 --> 02:17:23,124
When you were sitting there
eating that muffin?

2489
02:17:23,166 --> 02:17:24,542
Well, yeah.

2490
02:17:24,584 --> 02:17:25,836
I was sitting here
eating my muffin...

2491
02:17:25,877 --> 02:17:27,129
and drinking my coffee...

2492
02:17:27,170 --> 02:17:28,964
and replaying
the incident in my head...

2493
02:17:29,006 --> 02:17:33,011
when I had what alcoholics
refer to as a moment of clarity.

2494
02:17:33,053 --> 02:17:35,055
Fuck.

2495
02:17:35,097 --> 02:17:36,556
To be continued.

2496
02:17:48,194 --> 02:17:49,737
I love you, Pumpkin.

2497
02:17:49,779 --> 02:17:52,782
And I love you, Honey Bunny.

2498
02:17:52,824 --> 02:17:54,993
Everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!

2499
02:17:55,035 --> 02:17:57,580
Any of you
fucking pricks move...

2500
02:17:57,622 --> 02:18:01,042
and I'll execute every one
of you motherfuckers!

2501
02:18:01,042 --> 02:18:02,753
You got that?

2502
02:18:02,794 --> 02:18:04,254
You just be quiet!

2503
02:18:04,254 --> 02:18:07,383
Get the fuck down!
Get the fuck down!

2504
02:18:07,425 --> 02:18:09,386
You, you're in a blind spot.

2505
02:18:09,427 --> 02:18:12,181
Take your dames to that booth
on the count of ten.

2506
02:18:12,222 --> 02:18:13,723
Mexicans out
of the fucking kitchen!

2507
02:18:13,765 --> 02:18:16,810
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight!

2508
02:18:16,852 --> 02:18:18,145
Where the fuck are you going?

2509
02:18:18,187 --> 02:18:19,981
You fucking yuppie! Get down!

2510
02:18:20,022 --> 02:18:22,484
Hey, you, throw those bags!

2511
02:18:22,567 --> 02:18:25,320
Fucking wanker! Move! Move!

2512
02:18:25,362 --> 02:18:27,405
What the fuck are you doing?
Move!

2513
02:18:27,447 --> 02:18:28,949
The restaurant's ours!

2514
02:18:28,990 --> 02:18:30,534
Move!
Get down on the fucking floor!

2515
02:18:30,576 --> 02:18:32,495
Grandpa, down!

2516
02:18:32,536 --> 02:18:34,038
I'm the manager here...

2517
02:18:34,080 --> 02:18:35,999
and there's no problem...
no problem at all.

2518
02:18:36,040 --> 02:18:37,417
You're going to give me
a problem?

2519
02:18:37,459 --> 02:18:38,794
No, sir, I'm not.

2520
02:18:38,835 --> 02:18:40,962
I thought you said you're going
to give me a fucking problem!

2521
02:18:41,004 --> 02:18:43,799
You're going to give me
a fucking problem?

2522
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:45,801
I think we got a hero here,
Honey Bunny!

2523
02:18:45,843 --> 02:18:47,845
Well, just execute him!

2524
02:18:49,013 --> 02:18:51,516
I am not a hero.
I'm just a coffee shop...

2525
02:18:51,558 --> 02:18:52,934
Get the fuck down!

2526
02:18:52,975 --> 02:18:54,769
The restaurant's ours!

2527
02:18:54,811 --> 02:18:58,107
Just take whatever you want.

2528
02:18:58,148 --> 02:18:59,984
- You talk to the customers.
- Yeah.

2529
02:19:00,025 --> 02:19:01,903
You tell them
to be fucking cool...

2530
02:19:01,944 --> 02:19:03,363
- and everything will be over!
- Yeah.

2531
02:19:03,405 --> 02:19:04,947
- You understand me?
- Yes.

2532
02:19:07,450 --> 02:19:09,286
Listen, everybody.

2533
02:19:09,327 --> 02:19:10,662
Be calm...

2534
02:19:10,662 --> 02:19:11,997
cooperate...

2535
02:19:12,039 --> 02:19:14,625
and this will all be over
in a minute.

2536
02:19:14,667 --> 02:19:16,252
Get the fuck down!
Well done.

2537
02:19:28,599 --> 02:19:30,018
All right, now, people...

2538
02:19:30,059 --> 02:19:31,978
I'm going to come around
and collect your wallets.

2539
02:19:32,020 --> 02:19:33,397
You don't fucking talk.

2540
02:19:33,438 --> 02:19:35,733
You just throw them in the bag.
Are we clear?

2541
02:19:35,775 --> 02:19:38,027
I said, are we fucking clear?

2542
02:19:38,069 --> 02:19:40,030
Good. Now wallets out.

2543
02:19:41,907 --> 02:19:43,741
That's it.
Get the fuck down.

2544
02:19:43,783 --> 02:19:44,826
In the bag.

2545
02:19:44,868 --> 02:19:46,119
In the fucking bag!

2546
02:19:46,161 --> 02:19:49,290
I don't have
nothing on me, man.

2547
02:19:50,750 --> 02:19:52,502
What am I waiting for?
In the fucking bag.

2548
02:19:52,544 --> 02:19:55,088
Laura? Laura, tips.

2549
02:19:55,130 --> 02:19:56,589
- In the bag.
- Yeah.

2550
02:19:56,631 --> 02:19:58,383
- Is that a cellular phone?
- Yeah.

2551
02:19:58,425 --> 02:20:00,469
In the fucking bag.

2552
02:20:01,470 --> 02:20:02,972
Tidy up, tidy up.
That's it.

2553
02:20:03,013 --> 02:20:04,974
Now get the fuck
down on the floor.

2554
02:20:04,974 --> 02:20:08,186
In the bag.

2555
02:20:20,116 --> 02:20:21,534
In the bag.

2556
02:20:36,592 --> 02:20:37,927
What's in the case?

2557
02:20:37,969 --> 02:20:39,554
My boss's dirty laundry.

2558
02:20:39,596 --> 02:20:41,056
Your boss makes you
do his laundry?

2559
02:20:41,098 --> 02:20:42,057
When he wants it clean.

2560
02:20:42,099 --> 02:20:43,142
Sounds like a shit job.

2561
02:20:43,183 --> 02:20:44,936
Funny.
I was thinking the same thing.

2562
02:20:44,977 --> 02:20:45,978
Open it.

2563
02:20:46,020 --> 02:20:47,938
Afraid I can't do that.

2564
02:20:49,607 --> 02:20:50,900
I didn't hear you.

2565
02:20:50,900 --> 02:20:52,318
Yes, you did.

2566
02:20:53,486 --> 02:20:54,738
What's going on?

2567
02:20:54,780 --> 02:20:57,700
Looks like we got
a vigilante in our midst.

2568
02:20:57,700 --> 02:20:59,410
Shoot him in the face.

2569
02:20:59,452 --> 02:21:01,496
I hate to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time...

2570
02:21:01,579 --> 02:21:03,081
I've had a gun pointed at me.

2571
02:21:03,123 --> 02:21:05,543
You don't take your hand off
that case, it'll be your last.

2572
02:21:05,584 --> 02:21:07,753
Stop causing problems!
You'll get us all killed!

2573
02:21:07,795 --> 02:21:09,422
Give 'em what you got
and get 'em out of there!

2574
02:21:09,422 --> 02:21:10,757
Shut the fuck up, fat man!

2575
02:21:10,799 --> 02:21:12,050
This ain't none
of your goddamn business.

2576
02:21:14,093 --> 02:21:16,179
Be cool, Honey Bunny. Be cool.

2577
02:21:16,221 --> 02:21:18,223
It's no problem.
I got it under control.

2578
02:21:19,934 --> 02:21:21,811
Now I'm going to count to three.

2579
02:21:23,480 --> 02:21:25,189
If you don't open that case...

2580
02:21:25,231 --> 02:21:29,402
I'm going to unload
in your fucking face.

2581
02:21:31,697 --> 02:21:33,157
We clear?

2582
02:21:36,703 --> 02:21:37,703
One...

2583
02:21:41,499 --> 02:21:42,626
two...

2584
02:21:43,919 --> 02:21:45,170
- three.
- OK, Ringo.

2585
02:21:45,212 --> 02:21:47,548
You win.

2586
02:21:47,590 --> 02:21:49,092
It's yours.

2587
02:21:54,305 --> 02:21:56,141
Open it.

2588
02:21:59,895 --> 02:22:04,608
What is it?

2589
02:22:04,650 --> 02:22:07,278
Is that what I think it is?

2590
02:22:07,320 --> 02:22:09,030
Mm-hmm.

2591
02:22:11,909 --> 02:22:13,327
It's beautiful.

2592
02:22:13,369 --> 02:22:16,371
God damn it, what is it?

2593
02:22:18,082 --> 02:22:21,794
You let him go! You let him go!
Let go of him!

2594
02:22:21,836 --> 02:22:23,797
- Tell that bitch to be cool!
- I'm gonna kill you!

2595
02:22:23,838 --> 02:22:25,632
- Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
- Be cool, Honey Bunny!

2596
02:22:25,674 --> 02:22:27,176
- Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
- Be cool!

2597
02:22:27,259 --> 02:22:28,552
Tell that fuckin' bitch
to chill!

2598
02:22:28,594 --> 02:22:30,138
Be cool, Honey Bunny!

2599
02:22:30,179 --> 02:22:32,599
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

2600
02:22:32,641 --> 02:22:34,434
- Let go of him!
Chill!

2601
02:22:34,476 --> 02:22:35,644
Tell her it's
going to be all right.

2602
02:22:35,686 --> 02:22:36,687
It's going to be all right.

2603
02:22:36,729 --> 02:22:38,064
- Promise her!
- I promise!

2604
02:22:38,105 --> 02:22:39,858
- Tell her to chill!
- Just chill out, Honey Bunny!

2605
02:22:39,899 --> 02:22:41,318
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

2606
02:22:41,358 --> 02:22:43,110
All right, now, Yolanda!

2607
02:22:43,152 --> 02:22:45,113
We're not gonna
do anything stupid, are we?

2608
02:22:45,155 --> 02:22:46,573
Don't you hurt him!

2609
02:22:46,615 --> 02:22:47,866
Nobody's gonna hurt anybody.

2610
02:22:47,908 --> 02:22:50,369
We're all gonna be like
three little Fonzies here.

2611
02:22:50,369 --> 02:22:52,288
And what's Fonzie like?

2612
02:22:52,330 --> 02:22:54,623
Come on, Yolanda,
what's Fonzie like?!

2613
02:22:54,665 --> 02:22:55,791
He's cool?

2614
02:22:55,833 --> 02:22:57,210
What?
- Cool.

2615
02:22:57,251 --> 02:22:58,628
Correctamundo!

2616
02:22:58,670 --> 02:23:02,174
And that's what we're gonna be.
We're gonna be cool.

2617
02:23:02,216 --> 02:23:07,221
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

2618
02:23:07,262 --> 02:23:09,223
And when I count three...

2619
02:23:09,265 --> 02:23:11,559
I want you to let go
of your gun...

2620
02:23:11,601 --> 02:23:14,146
put your palms
flat on the table...

2621
02:23:14,187 --> 02:23:16,815
and sit your ass down.

2622
02:23:16,857 --> 02:23:21,195
But when you do it,
you do it cool.

2623
02:23:21,236 --> 02:23:22,363
You ready?

2624
02:23:23,781 --> 02:23:25,825
One...

2625
02:23:25,867 --> 02:23:27,994
two...

2626
02:23:28,036 --> 02:23:29,329
three.

2627
02:23:36,879 --> 02:23:39,382
OK, now you let him go!

2628
02:23:39,424 --> 02:23:41,635
Yolanda, I thought
you were gonna be cool.

2629
02:23:41,676 --> 02:23:43,721
Now, when you yell at me,
it makes me nervous.

2630
02:23:43,762 --> 02:23:45,889
And when I get nervous,
I get scared.

2631
02:23:45,931 --> 02:23:47,808
And when motherfuckers
get scared...

2632
02:23:47,850 --> 02:23:51,521
that's when motherfuckers
accidentally get shot.

2633
02:23:51,521 --> 02:23:55,108
Just know,
you hurt him, you die.

2634
02:23:55,150 --> 02:23:58,738
Well, that seems
to be the situation.

2635
02:23:58,779 --> 02:24:02,534
But I don't want that,
and you don't want that...

2636
02:24:02,575 --> 02:24:05,496
and Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

2637
02:24:05,537 --> 02:24:07,540
So let's see what we can do.

2638
02:24:07,581 --> 02:24:09,876
Now...

2639
02:24:09,918 --> 02:24:13,629
here's the situation.

2640
02:24:13,671 --> 02:24:15,006
Normally both your asses...

2641
02:24:15,048 --> 02:24:17,050
would be dead
as fuckin' fried chicken...

2642
02:24:17,092 --> 02:24:18,343
but you happened
to pull this shit...

2643
02:24:18,385 --> 02:24:19,720
while I'm in
a transitional period...

2644
02:24:19,762 --> 02:24:22,598
and I don't want to kill you.
I want to help you.

2645
02:24:22,640 --> 02:24:27,311
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

2646
02:24:27,353 --> 02:24:30,607
Besides, I been through
too much shit over this case...

2647
02:24:30,649 --> 02:24:33,944
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

2648
02:24:33,986 --> 02:24:35,571
Vincent!

2649
02:24:35,613 --> 02:24:37,197
Be cool!

2650
02:24:37,239 --> 02:24:40,242
Yolanda, it's cool, baby!
It's cool!

2651
02:24:40,284 --> 02:24:41,452
We still just talking!

2652
02:24:41,494 --> 02:24:43,163
Come on, point the gun at me!

2653
02:24:43,204 --> 02:24:45,082
Point the gun at me!
There you go.

2654
02:24:45,123 --> 02:24:49,795
Now, Vincent, you just hang back
and don't do a goddamn thing.

2655
02:24:49,836 --> 02:24:52,548
Tell her we're still cool.

2656
02:24:52,590 --> 02:24:54,050
We're still cool, Honey Bunny.

2657
02:24:54,133 --> 02:24:56,135
How we doing, baby?

2658
02:24:56,177 --> 02:24:59,431
I... I gotta go pee.
I want to go home.

2659
02:24:59,473 --> 02:25:01,016
Just hang in there, baby.

2660
02:25:01,058 --> 02:25:02,601
You're doin' great.
I'm proud of you.

2661
02:25:02,642 --> 02:25:03,894
And Ringo's proud of you.

2662
02:25:03,935 --> 02:25:05,771
It's almost over.

2663
02:25:05,771 --> 02:25:07,732
Tell her you're proud of her.

2664
02:25:07,773 --> 02:25:09,067
I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.

2665
02:25:09,108 --> 02:25:10,902
I love you.

2666
02:25:10,944 --> 02:25:12,613
I love you, too, Honey Bunny.

2667
02:25:12,654 --> 02:25:17,784
I want you to go in that bag
and find my wallet.

2668
02:25:20,371 --> 02:25:21,831
Which one is it?

2669
02:25:21,873 --> 02:25:24,209
It's the one that says
"Bad Motherfucker."

2670
02:25:38,893 --> 02:25:40,561
That's it.

2671
02:25:40,602 --> 02:25:42,021
That's my Bad Motherfucker.

2672
02:25:42,062 --> 02:25:44,649
Open it up. Take out the money.

2673
02:25:50,364 --> 02:25:51,866
Count it.

2674
02:25:58,289 --> 02:26:00,750
How much is there?

2675
02:26:03,045 --> 02:26:04,505
About $1,500.

2676
02:26:04,588 --> 02:26:07,799
OK, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

2677
02:26:07,841 --> 02:26:10,803
With the rest of those wallets
and the register...

2678
02:26:10,803 --> 02:26:12,764
that makes this a pretty
successful little score.

2679
02:26:12,805 --> 02:26:15,392
Jules, you give
that fuckin' nimrod $1,500...

2680
02:26:15,434 --> 02:26:17,227
and I'll shoot him
on general principle.

2681
02:26:17,227 --> 02:26:18,353
No, Yolanda, Yolanda!

2682
02:26:18,394 --> 02:26:20,522
He ain't gonna do a goddamn
motherfuckin' thing.

2683
02:26:20,564 --> 02:26:22,232
Vince, shut the fuck up!

2684
02:26:22,274 --> 02:26:23,859
Shut up!

2685
02:26:23,901 --> 02:26:25,862
Come on, Yolanda,
stay with me, baby.

2686
02:26:25,862 --> 02:26:29,992
Now, I ain't givin' it to him,
Vincent.

2687
02:26:30,033 --> 02:26:31,826
I'm buyin' somethin'
for my money.

2688
02:26:31,868 --> 02:26:35,414
Wanna know what I'm buyin',
Ringo?

2689
02:26:35,414 --> 02:26:36,540
What?

2690
02:26:36,540 --> 02:26:37,667
Your life.

2691
02:26:37,750 --> 02:26:39,377
I'm givin' you that money...

2692
02:26:39,419 --> 02:26:42,255
so I don't have
to kill your ass.

2693
02:26:42,297 --> 02:26:45,133
You read the Bible, Ringo?

2694
02:26:45,174 --> 02:26:46,801
Not regularly, no.

2695
02:26:46,843 --> 02:26:49,263
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

2696
02:26:49,304 --> 02:26:53,017
"Ezekiel" 25:17.

2697
02:26:53,059 --> 02:26:56,146
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

2698
02:26:56,188 --> 02:26:58,023
"by the inequities
of the selfish...

2699
02:26:58,023 --> 02:26:59,859
"and the tyranny of evil men.

2700
02:26:59,900 --> 02:27:03,446
"Blessed is he who in the name
of charity and good will...

2701
02:27:03,488 --> 02:27:05,824
"shepherds the weak through
the Valley of Darkness...

2702
02:27:05,866 --> 02:27:07,326
"for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

2703
02:27:07,368 --> 02:27:10,037
"and the finder
of lost children.

2704
02:27:10,078 --> 02:27:11,997
"And I will strike down
upon thee...

2705
02:27:12,039 --> 02:27:14,375
"with great vengeance
and furious anger...

2706
02:27:14,417 --> 02:27:17,462
"those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

2707
02:27:17,504 --> 02:27:20,507
"And you will know
I am the Lord...

2708
02:27:20,549 --> 02:27:24,177
"when I lay My vengeance
upon you."

2709
02:27:24,219 --> 02:27:27,515
Now, I been sayin'
that shit for years.

2710
02:27:27,556 --> 02:27:32,062
And if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

2711
02:27:32,104 --> 02:27:33,939
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2712
02:27:33,981 --> 02:27:35,607
I just thought
it was some cold-blooded shit...

2713
02:27:35,648 --> 02:27:39,236
to say to a motherfucker before
I popped a cap in his ass.

2714
02:27:39,320 --> 02:27:42,949
But I saw some shit this mornin'
made me think twice.

2715
02:27:42,991 --> 02:27:45,118
See, now I'm thinkin'...

2716
02:27:45,160 --> 02:27:48,872
maybe it means
you're the evil man...

2717
02:27:48,913 --> 02:27:50,874
and I'm the righteous man...

2718
02:27:50,916 --> 02:27:53,002
and Mr. Nine-millimeter here...

2719
02:27:53,043 --> 02:27:55,004
he's the shepherd
protecting my righteous ass...

2720
02:27:55,004 --> 02:27:57,590
in the Valley of Darkness.

2721
02:27:57,632 --> 02:27:59,593
Or it could mean...

2722
02:27:59,634 --> 02:28:02,846
you're the righteous man
and I'm the shepherd...

2723
02:28:02,887 --> 02:28:07,101
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2724
02:28:07,142 --> 02:28:09,437
Now, I'd like that.

2725
02:28:09,479 --> 02:28:12,357
But that shit ain't the truth.

2726
02:28:12,399 --> 02:28:14,192
The truth is...

2727
02:28:15,526 --> 02:28:18,572
you're the weak...

2728
02:28:18,614 --> 02:28:22,076
and I am the tyranny
of evil men.

2729
02:28:22,118 --> 02:28:26,331
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2730
02:28:26,373 --> 02:28:31,963
I'm tryin' real hard
to be the shepherd.

2731
02:28:47,355 --> 02:28:48,565
Go on.

2732
02:29:07,294 --> 02:29:10,005
I think we should
be leaving now.

2733
02:29:10,047 --> 02:29:12,049
Yeah,
that's probably a good idea.
