1
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:24,813
When I think of my wife...

2
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,703
I always think of her head.

3
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:34,065
I picture cracking her lovely skull...

4
00:00:34,116 --> 00:00:36,366
Unspooling her brains...

5
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,040
Trying to get answers.

6
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:43,748
The primal questions of any marriage.

7
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:46,133
"What are you thinking?"

8
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,420
"How are you feeling?"

9
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:51,094
"What have we done to each other?"

10
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:30,072
The Irish prince
graces us with his presence.

11
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,864
His majesty prefers not to be moistened.

12
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,362
I got you a present.

13
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,410
- I hated this game.
- You loved it.

14
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,741
You loved it.

15
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,076
Thank you.
I'll add it to the collection.

16
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:47,042
Can you pour me a bourbon?

17
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:55,377
What's up, jitters?

18
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,435
Well, if you're not going to talk,
I'm gonna have to fill the silence...

19
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:04,852
With another excruciating story
by margo dunne.

20
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:07,562
I could tell you about
my recent customer service experience...

21
00:03:07,603 --> 00:03:09,613
- Changing Internet service providers.
- I like that one.

22
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:12,517
Or how about the time I saw that woman
who looked exactly like my friend Monica?

23
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,487
But it wasn't Monica.
It was a total stranger.

24
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,447
Who was also named Monica.

25
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:18,624
- Made it kind of interesting.
- It's great.

26
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,570
I'm just having a bad day.

27
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:22,576
- Amy?
- It's our anniversary.

28
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:24,578
- Five years.
- Five?

29
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,790
That came fast.

30
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,160
And furious.

31
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,801
I'm so crazy, stupid happy.

32
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:39,093
I met a boy.

33
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:43,565
A great, sweet, gorgeous, cool-ass guy.

34
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,098
Excuse me, miss?

35
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,603
I just want you to be careful...

36
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:51,444
Where you put down that
monk-brewed Belgian wheat beer...

37
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,190
Because the party's down to three
beast lights and a bottle of pucker.

38
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,943
It might attract
some desperate characters.

39
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,825
It could.
I mean, the amish are on a rumspringa.

40
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,449
They already relieved me
of my artisanal meat platter.

41
00:04:05,494 --> 00:04:08,374
Finally, someone tells me
how to pronounce that word.

42
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,374
"Meat"?

43
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,665
Yes, "meat." One syllable.

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,670
Thank you. Whose beer am I
about to drink?

45
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,001
Don't tell me.

46
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:17,341
Let's see, who's your type?

47
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,837
I don't see you sitting quietly...

48
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:22,473
While he bloviates
on his postgrad thesis about proust.

49
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,812
Uh-oh. Is that him?

50
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,128
Ironic hipster, so self-aware,
he makes everything a joke.

51
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,350
I prefer men who are funny, not "funny."

52
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,518
What type are you?

53
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,024
Corn-fed,
salt-of-the-earth Missouri guy.

54
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,186
Missouri?

55
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,154
Cute.

56
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,533
- Native new yorker?
- The world ends at the Hudson.

57
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,650
What's your name?

58
00:04:40,696 --> 00:04:41,656
Amy.

59
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:44,027
Well, Amy, who are you?

60
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,538
A, I'm an award-winning scrimshander.

61
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:52,749
B, I'm a moderately influential warlord.

62
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,922
C, I write personality quizzes
for magazines.

63
00:04:56,295 --> 00:05:00,505
Okay. Your hands are far too delicate
for real scrimshaw work...

64
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,800
And I happen to be a charter subscriber
to middling warlord weekly...

65
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,055
So I'd recognize you.

66
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,718
I'm gonna go with "c."

67
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,184
And you?

68
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:10,556
Who are you?

69
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:14,941
I'm the guy to save you
from all this awesomeness.

70
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:21,856
So, you write for a men's magazine.

71
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:25,164
God, does that make you an expert
on being a man?

72
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,279
No.

73
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,397
It's what to wear, what to drink.

74
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,371
How to bullshit.

75
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,003
Never with you.

76
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:32,869
Ha, ha.

77
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,535
No, I mean it.

78
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,384
It's hard to believe you.

79
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,209
Why?

80
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,883
I think it's your chin.

81
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,051
My chin?

82
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,759
Yeah, it's quite villainous.

83
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,430
Okay, how's this?

84
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,598
A hundred percent true, no bullshit.

85
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:49,933
Okay.

86
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,564
We all move to New York...

87
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:55,731
And we end up living in these little
cubby holes, and that's not it.

88
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:59,231
Come outside. Then, you're in it.

89
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,402
You have to see this.

90
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,044
Hey.

91
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,040
Hey.

92
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,799
I have to kiss you now.

93
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,262
Is that right?

94
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,472
I can't let you go through
a sugar storm unkissed.

95
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,467
Wait a second.

96
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,646
There you go.

97
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,994
Nick dunne...

98
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,834
I really like you.

99
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,252
So, is Amy gonna do
one of those anniversary...

100
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,514
Treasure hunts?

101
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,549
You mean the forced march
designed to prove...

102
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,552
What an oblivious and uncaring asshole
her husband is?

103
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,675
Wow.

104
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,226
Life. I don't remember the point.

105
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,478
Deep hasbro thoughts.

106
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,850
Spin.

107
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,899
What was the clue last year
she got so mad about?

108
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,241
"When your poor Amy has a cold...

109
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,988
"This dessert just must be sold."

110
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,989
The answer?

111
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,820
I still don't know the answer, go.

112
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,026
- A few years ago, you'd have known.
- A few years ago, it was fun.

113
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,736
Year one,
the traditional gift was paper.

114
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:37,246
She got me a beautiful notebook.
Told me to go write my novel.

115
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,170
What did you get her?

116
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,577
A kite.

117
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,455
- She'd never flown a kite.
- Okay.

118
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,010
Anyway. Year four, flowers.

119
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:48,297
She led me outside
to the dying rosebush in the backyard.

120
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,684
That's symbolic.

121
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,679
Yeah.

122
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,180
What's the gift for five?

123
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,011
Wood.

124
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,515
- So, what did you get her?
- There's no good gift for wood.

125
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,888
I know! Go home, fuck her brains out,
slap her with your penis.

126
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,396
"There's some wood for you, bitch."

127
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,231
The bar.

128
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,405
Why, yes. Hang on one second.

129
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,606
Hey, it's watchful Wally.

130
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,908
Hey, Walt. What's going on?

131
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,367
Thanks very much. I'll be right there.
All right, bye-bye.

132
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,264
Hey, buddy. What are you doing out here?

133
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,973
Thanks, Walt!

134
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,027
Ame?

135
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,847
Amy!

136
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,186
Hello?

137
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,154
Come on in.

138
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:32,704
Hey.

139
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,158
- Mister dunne.
- Hi.

140
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,698
I'm detective Rhonda boney.
This is officer James gilpin.

141
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,702
We understand there are concerns
about your wife.

142
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:42,664
I don't know where my wife is.
And I came home to this.

143
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,498
Now, I don't panic easily...

144
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,916
But it's weird, right?

145
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,173
Mind if we look around?

146
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,344
Please.

147
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,663
How long have you two been here?

148
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,506
Two years in September.
We used to live in New York.

149
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,644
City?

150
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,810
Yeah, I was a writer.
We were both writers.

151
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,480
Why did you all move back here?

152
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,138
My mom got sick.

153
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,147
Oh, I'm sorry. How is she?

154
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,650
She's dead.

155
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,691
I'm so sorry.

156
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,696
What do you do now, for work?

157
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,406
My sister margo and I
own the bar downtown.

158
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,710
Oh, the bar.

159
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,997
Love the name. Very meta.

160
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,131
Thanks.

161
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,876
Pretty things.

162
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,975
Stay.

163
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,761
My office, here.

164
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,847
Beautiful dress.

165
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:48,645
Date night?

166
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,939
It's our anniversary.

167
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,610
It's a guest bedroom, there.

168
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,534
Cat's room on the end.

169
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,122
I checked up here.

170
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,585
This is the kitchen...

171
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,961
Obviously.

172
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,561
This is my wife's office.

173
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,218
Amy's office.

174
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,320
Wow. Impressive gal.

175
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,576
Yeah. Should I be concerned?

176
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,787
I remember these.

177
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,286
I loved these books.

178
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,878
Wait a minute.

179
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,918
Your wife is amazing Amy?

180
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,844
Yeah. She is.

181
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,512
Wow.

182
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:04,141
Amazing-fucking-Amy
is getting fucking married.

183
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,972
That's how the night started.

184
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:12,107
With me, regular, flawed, real Amy,
jealous, as always, of the golden child.

185
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:16,738
Perfect, brilliant, amazing Amy,
who's getting fucking married.

186
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,859
When I was 10, I quit cello.

187
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:22,495
In the next book,
amazing Amy became a prodigy.

188
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:25,912
Did you play volleyball?

189
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,875
I got cut, freshman year.

190
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,834
She made varsity.

191
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,250
When did you have a dog?

192
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,294
She got the dog.

193
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,421
Puddles made her more relatable.

194
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,805
Wow.

195
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,971
I love your parents...

196
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,800
But they really can be assholes.

197
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,295
- Nick!
- Sir!

198
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,137
Hey, thanks for coming, man.

199
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:46,972
No problem.

200
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,426
Hey, sweetheart.

201
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,438
Big night for your mom.

202
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,308
It would mean so much
if you would talk to a few reporters...

203
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,227
Bloggers, give them a little Amy color.

204
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,145
People wanna hear from you.

205
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,824
- We can't stay long.
- Fantastic.

206
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,032
Fifteen minutes, tops.

207
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:06,665
This is why I have my brownstone.
My trust fund. I know I can't complain.

208
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,332
Your parents literally
plagiarized your childhood.

209
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:13,422
No, they improved upon it,
and then peddled it to the masses.

210
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,669
I thought you were gonna wear white
to match the wedding theme.

211
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,171
I thought that would be creepy.

212
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,673
"If it's worth doing,
it's worth doing..."

213
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,045
hold up! I know how this ends.
Don't tell me.

214
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,893
You're very cute, Nick.

215
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,568
Amy, you know
what would make dad's night.

216
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,216
I'm on it.

217
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,516
I love having strangers
pick at my scabs.

218
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:32,811
I'm curious whether...

219
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,564
It's difficult for you to see
amazing Amy heading down the aisle.

220
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,029
And this big party
celebrating this fictional wedding.

221
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,397
Because it's my understanding
you are not married.

222
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,114
Is that correct?

223
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,832
Correct. Amazing Amy has always been
one step ahead of me.

224
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:50,698
Excuse me. I'm sorry,
I just have a few questions.

225
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,000
It's you.

226
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,579
I'm here in a
strictly journalistic capacity.

227
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:58,206
Now, you had the distinct pleasure
of dating Nick dunne for how long?

228
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,054
- Two magical years.
- Two magical years.

229
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,930
In the course of that time,
you've had the opportunity...

230
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,427
To perform such gracious gestures as...

231
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:09,389
Not correcting Nick when he
pronounced "quinoa" as "kween-o-a."

232
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,892
An understandable mistake.

233
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,133
He also thought it was a fish.

234
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,733
He thinks velveeta is a cheese.

235
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,060
You also manage to appear
shocked and delighted...

236
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,686
When Nick's elderly mother
breaks into an impromptu rendition...

237
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,944
Of New York, New York,
every time she sees you.

238
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,026
[S]These bag of bone shoes

239
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,241
that's just frightening.

240
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,911
You also bought Nick
his very first pair of scissors.

241
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,620
And matching stapler.

242
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,580
Amy elliott, you are more than amazing.

243
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:36,132
You are brilliant,
yet entirely un-snobby.

244
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:39,797
You challenge me. You surprise me.

245
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,167
And, fun fact for the readers...

246
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,299
You have a world-class vagina.

247
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,433
My colleagues tell me
that you are not yet married.

248
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,761
Is that correct?

249
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,266
I'm not.

250
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,638
Isn't it time we fixed that?

251
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,772
And then...

252
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,652
The night wasn't so bad anymore.

253
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,498
And it's done. Crossed off the list.

254
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:22,503
Now, normally, we would not treat this
as a missing persons case so quick...

255
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:23,987
But given the scene at your house...

256
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,126
And given our spike
in violent crime of late...

257
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,635
We are gonna take this
very, very seriously.

258
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:29,638
Okay. Good.

259
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,969
We've got forensics over at your place.
You got somewhere to stay?

260
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,595
- I could stay at my sister's.
- Okay.

261
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,942
We're tracking Amy's phone,
her credit cards.

262
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,648
We will organize searches,
put up flyers.

263
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,331
We're gonna hold a press
conference tomorrow.

264
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:41,688
You're having a
press conference?

265
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,322
I wanna get the word out, right?

266
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,649
Yeah, it's just all of a sudden,
I feel like I'm on a law & order episode.

267
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,875
Time is of the essence in these cases.

268
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,665
But, that said,
do you wanna wait and call a lawyer?

269
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,840
Absolutely not. I just wanna help.

270
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,668
So, you and Amy
have been here two years.

271
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,973
- You tend bar...
- I own the bar.

272
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:10,508
And I teach creative writing at mvcc.

273
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,353
- No kids?
- Not yet.

274
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,848
So, what does Amy do most days?

275
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,100
A woman with all those degrees,
what does she do?

276
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,021
I don't know. She keeps busy.

277
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,560
Doing what?

278
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,402
She's a voracious reader.

279
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,281
So, she's always got a book in her hand.

280
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,821
Well, days can get long.

281
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:32,703
I know a few housewives, that evening
glass of wine starts coming at noon.

282
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,032
Or prescription pills.

283
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,576
Just last week, we had a soccer mom.

284
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,080
Nice lady. Got her teeth kicked in
over some oxycontin.

285
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,212
Ever since that mall went bust,
half the town is out of work.

286
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,749
We cannot keep up
with the drug violence.

287
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,212
I'm pretty sure that's not it.

288
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,093
Has Amy got friends we can talk to?

289
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,380
No, not really.

290
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,385
No friends? This whole town?

291
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:55,057
She was very close with my mom,
before she passed away.

292
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,217
You know, we have a pretty serious
homeless problem...

293
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,386
In our neighborhood.

294
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,486
I think maybe you guys
should check that out.

295
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:02,771
We'll look into that.

296
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,443
You got to the bar around 11:00 today.

297
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,073
Where were you before that?
Just to cross that out.

298
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,069
Well, I was home.

299
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,740
I left at 9:30,
I got a cup of coffee, a newspaper.

300
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,410
I went to Sawyer beach
and read the news.

301
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,618
Did you visit with anyone there?

302
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,619
I kind of go to Sawyer beach
for the solitude.

303
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,367
So, your wife has no friends here.

304
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,254
Is she kinda standoffish?

305
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,711
Ivy league? Rubs people the wrong way?

306
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,252
She's from New York.

307
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,761
She's complicated.
She's got very high standards.

308
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,630
Type a?

309
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,548
That can make you crazy
if you're not like that.

310
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,425
You seem pretty laid-back. Type b.

311
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,643
Speaking of which, Amy's blood type?

312
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,984
God, I don't know.
I'd have to look it up at the house.

313
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,809
You don't know if she has friends,
you don't know what she does all day...

314
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,766
And you don't know
your wife's blood type.

315
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:47,936
Sure you all are married?

316
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:50,654
Maybe it's type o.

317
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,915
- Where are her folks? New York?
- Yeah.

318
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,657
Can they get here time
for this press conference tomorrow?

319
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,739
Tomorrow? I have no idea.
I haven't talked to them.

320
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,624
You haven't called
your wife's parents yet?

321
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,081
You can't get a signal in this building.
I've been in here talking to you.

322
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,582
Call them, please, Nick. Now.

323
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,834
Fine.

324
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,299
Should I know my wife's blood type?

325
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,341
No.

326
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:17,466
I apologize, marybeth.
I didn't know what was going on.

327
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,013
Now I'm at the station...

328
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:22,556
And the cops are at the house,
and it's serious and I'm calling you.

329
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,229
There's a lot of things
that are being juggled right now.

330
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,532
I'm standing right next to
detective Rhonda boney...

331
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,527
Who's the lead investigator on this
and she's...

332
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,949
My mother-in-law
would like to speak with you.

333
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,656
This is detective boney.

334
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,041
I wanna go home.

335
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,537
I don't know why I have to be here.

336
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,210
I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home.

337
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,379
Dad?

338
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,382
This is my father. What's going on?

339
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,459
Really? You're Nick dunne?

340
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,712
We've been trying to get a hold of you
all afternoon.

341
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,416
I've been right there.
My wife is missing.

342
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,586
- Bitch.
- Don't.

343
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,014
Your father wandered out of comfort hill
after lunch.

344
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,433
We found him walking route 79,
disoriented.

345
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,932
We've been trying to call you
for the last...

346
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,223
I don't get a cell signal
in this building.

347
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,226
I've been sitting
20 feet away from you.

348
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,190
Sir, please
don't take that tone with me.

349
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:07,349
Stupid, dumb, ugly bitch.

350
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,936
Dad, stop.

351
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,819
You wanna drive him home?

352
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,776
I think that would be wise. Thanks.

353
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,431
This voice mailbox is currently full.

354
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,255
Fuck.

355
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:45,063
Get your fucking hands off me.

356
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,481
Thanks.

357
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:03,452
Everyone told us
and told us and told us...

358
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:06,084
Marriage is hard work.

359
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:09,172
And compromise and more work.

360
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,458
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter."

361
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:14,422
"When young Amy's hope did wane...

362
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,803
"She wandered here..."

363
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,340
Well, it's not true.
Not for me and Nick.

364
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:21,014
"...In search of Jane."

365
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,973
With us, two years...

366
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,643
It's just good.

367
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,982
Austen.

368
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:33,478
You were an alienated teen
and only Elizabeth Bennet understood you.

369
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,983
Look at that.

370
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,200
My God.

371
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:40,987
You naughty minx.

372
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:44,122
Well, technically, we are supposed
to fuck at the next stop.

373
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,790
Yeah, in keeping with tradition.

374
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:49,328
But I might be willing
to bend the rules this once.

375
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,083
God bless Jane Austen.

376
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:10,442
I'm enthusiastic. Look at that.
It's confirmed by the...

377
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,687
Thank you.

378
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,194
Year two. Cotton.

379
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:29,201
We had that joke that our sex
was too good for ordinary.

380
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:31,707
So, these are 2,000 thread-count...

381
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,674
we're so cute.
I wanna punch us in the face.

382
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,925
That's pretty great.
I mean, that is pretty great.

383
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:45,847
Did they ask if you wanted a lawyer?

384
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,058
I don't need a lawyer.
Here, I'll do this.

385
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,518
Well, did they ask personal stuff
about Amy?

386
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,730
You know, they asked...

387
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,521
Why didn't she have any friends?

388
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:54,403
What did you say?

389
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,438
- I said she was complicated.
- Nick!

390
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,071
Everyone knows "complicated"
is code for "bitch."

391
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,281
God. I feel sick.

392
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,736
Thanks.

393
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,035
It's so bizarre.

394
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,580
It seems like the kind of thing
that would happen to Amy.

395
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:14,794
She always attracts...

396
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,424
drama?

397
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,633
You can say it. It's just me and you.

398
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,221
Just because
I don't like to be around Amy...

399
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,697
Doesn't mean I don't care about her.

400
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:27,765
Anyway, whoever took her
is bound to bring her back.

401
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,146
Detective? Excuse me.

402
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,822
I'm noelle hawthorne.
I'm Amy's best friend.

403
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,605
Well, great. Where do you live, noelle?

404
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,657
Five doors down. 1032.

405
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,910
Wonderful. I would love to talk to you.

406
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:51,832
Can I come by in half an hour?

407
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,581
- Y'all know anything yet?
- I'm sorry.

408
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:56,423
I got guys on the clock in here.
But you give me 30 minutes.

409
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:57,789
But that's usually bath time.

410
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,134
Well, we'll talk in between shampoos.

411
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,183
All right. So, what do you got?

412
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:07,848
It was definitely blood spatter
you saw in the kitchen.

413
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:10,006
Normally, kitchen, knives, food prep.

414
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,426
Not that weird,
but that is awfully high.

415
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,105
So, I'm gonna order a luminol sweep.

416
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,313
Well, okay.

417
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:19,112
Interesting.

418
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,268
What's that?

419
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:23,816
House is rented in her name.
Car's in her name.

420
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:26,991
Credit cards, utilities,
phone bill, all in her name.

421
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,871
Even his bar's in her name.

422
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,828
I don't know that that's so surprising.

423
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,488
No. But it is humiliating.

424
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:33,447
What you got?

425
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:36,326
It's with her unmentionables.

426
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:51,558
Well, we have our first clue.

427
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,320
I have to take a shower.

428
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,150
No, don't. You've been up all night.

429
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,355
You wanna look
like you've been up all night.

430
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:12,331
Hey, be careful today, okay?

431
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:13,698
That's a weird thing to say.

432
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:17,504
Well, when you're upset, you bottle up.
You can seem angry, like...

433
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,040
please don't say, "like dad."

434
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,843
Or else you swing into your momma's-boy
charm offensive and that can feel glib.

435
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:22,668
Perfect.

436
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:25,462
I'll balance on the exact fucking edge
of your emotional razor.

437
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,336
Okay. Just be...

438
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,303
Myself?

439
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,683
Sponsoring a raffle to
benefit west county 4h...

440
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:35,181
And raffling season tickets for
mizzou football.

441
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:38,524
Buy your tickets at the wing hut or
local tri-state tire stores.

442
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,437
Your in-laws made it.

443
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:47,494
- Hi, rand.
- Hey, man.

444
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:48,358
I'm detective boney.

445
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,364
I'm the twin. Margo.

446
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:53,486
We played tennis yesterday, Nick.
I just can't get over it.

447
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:54,874
Marybeth, I am really sorry.

448
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,701
I knew you never should have
moved back here.

449
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:57,866
We didn't have a lot of choice.

450
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:01,584
We are all worried. We are all scared.

451
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:06,086
But we are all here now.
And we will find Amy, together.

452
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:18,227
Should I just go first, and then
you guys can say something?

453
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,227
Good.

454
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:25,235
As you know, my wife,
Amy elliott dunne...

455
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:28,074
Disappeared from our home
on the morning of July 5th...

456
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,568
Under suspicious circumstances.

457
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:33,074
Louder!

458
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:37,535
If anyone out there
has any information...

459
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,908
Please come forward.

460
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:41,576
Thank you.

461
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:46,748
I'm rand elliott.
My wife, marybeth elliott.

462
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:47,877
Should I have said my name?

463
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,424
Amy is our only child.

464
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:54,466
She's bright, she's beautiful.
She's kind.

465
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:56,471
She really is amazing Amy.

466
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:59,516
You know, there are
millions of people out there...

467
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:02,099
Who grew up with her and care about her.

468
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,774
We care about her, we love her.

469
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:08,071
And we just want her back.

470
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:12,606
Amy is a decorated scholar.

471
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,625
She forged a successful career
in journalism.

472
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:17,948
She returned here
to her husband's hometown...

473
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:20,334
And she made a life in her adopted home.

474
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,794
Now, Amy needs your help.

475
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:27,963
We're establishing a volunteer
headquarters at the drury lodge.

476
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:33,344
We have a hotline, 1-855-4-Amy-tips.

477
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:39,013
And our website is
www.Findamazingamy.Com.

478
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:41,475
- Mr. dunne!
- Mr. elliott!

479
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:44,692
Mr. dunne, any signs of foul play?

480
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:50,109
Mr. elliott, when was the last time
you spoke to your daughter?

481
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:52,611
Smile.

482
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:00,792
That's all for now. Thank you.

483
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:06,212
Amy is the kind of girl
who attracts admirers.

484
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,130
Right, Nick?

485
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:08,338
Yeah, definitely.

486
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,877
And we've had instances...

487
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:12,972
- Where things got...
- Scary.

488
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:14,467
Do you know about desi collings?

489
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:16,179
Yeah, I know all about desi collings.

490
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:17,469
He was obsessed.

491
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:20,852
He attempted suicide after Amy
broke up with him sophomore year.

492
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,430
We had to file a restraining order.

493
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:24,855
This would be high school?
Twenty years ago?

494
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:28,114
But he recently moved to St. Louis.
That's just two hours away.

495
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,017
To be fair, he is from St. Louis.

496
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:31,686
We also have Tommy O'Hara.

497
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,944
This is only eight years ago,
in New York.

498
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,276
She broke up with him,
he got very physical.

499
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,002
- She filed charges.
- What was the charge?

500
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:40,122
Sexual assault, threat, battery, what?

501
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,119
I only know it was bad.

502
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,951
- I didn't know this.
- Okay.

503
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,906
Thank you.

504
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:47,247
Anything more recent?

505
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,586
Not that I know of.

506
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:57,969
Hey, Nick? You got a minute?

507
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:00,756
Yeah.

508
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,523
Imagine our confusion.

509
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:08,732
A missing persons case...

510
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:11,361
And in your wife's dressing room,
we find an envelope marked "clue."

511
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,649
That's for our anniversary.

512
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:15,993
My wife does these treasure hunts.

513
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,408
I'm hoping you can tell me
what this means.

514
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:19,447
You want to solve Amy's treasure hunt?

515
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:22,186
It'll help me track Amy's movements
before she disappeared.

516
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,580
Of course. Okay.

517
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,210
"Although this spot
couldn't be tighter...

518
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:30,667
"It's a cozy room
for my favorite writer."

519
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:34,714
I know this one!

520
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:38,724
Although this spot
couldn't be any tighter...

521
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:42,143
It's a cozy room for my favorite writer.

522
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:47,059
After-school meeting,
don't mind if I do.

523
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:50,021
Maybe I'll teach you a thing or two.

524
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,396
Well, well. What does it say?

525
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:57,954
Clue two.

526
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:02,451
"Hey, handsome man, let's go undercover.

527
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,830
"You'll be the spy,
and I'll be his lover.

528
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,370
"Let's head on over...

529
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,294
"To the little brown house.

530
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:14,043
"We'll play hot, doting husband,
sweet, loving spouse."

531
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:17,839
These yours?

532
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:19,716
No.

533
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,219
But you read the first clue.

534
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,390
Randy Professor, naughty student.

535
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,470
I blush.

536
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:27,275
Me and my ex just swapped cards.

537
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:29,846
Where's this little brown house?

538
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:31,404
I have no idea.

539
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:15,975
Hello?

540
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:18,529
Nicholas dunne.

541
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:22,283
Under my father's name, William dunne.

542
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:32,793
My wife's first pet? Is this necessary?
Can you just turn the bell...

543
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:33,792
yeah, I know.

544
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,463
It's... it's...

545
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,210
It's "puddles," right?
Or is it "poodles?"

546
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:45,765
We're good.

547
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,466
Hello, stranger.

548
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,644
Fancy meeting you here.

549
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:52,983
It's your dad's house, right?

550
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,649
Are you following me?

551
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:55,557
What you doing?

552
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:57,775
Like you said, it's my dad's house.

553
00:30:57,815 --> 00:31:00,525
I come by once a week,
make sure the place hasn't burned down.

554
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,610
But it looks okay.

555
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,243
I'll walk you out.

556
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:10,993
You know...

557
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:14,287
I thought maybe
this was the little brown house.

558
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:15,542
From the clue.

559
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,543
Nope. Still blue.

560
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:38,228
Picture me,
I'm a girl who's very, very bad.

561
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:41,982
I need to be punished,
and by "punished," I mean "had."

562
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:45,615
It's where you keep goodies
for anniversary five.

563
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:49,665
"So open the door, and look alive."

564
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:51,992
Bitch!

565
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:58,706
Want to test your marriage
for weak spots?

566
00:31:59,377 --> 00:32:00,837
Add one recession...

567
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,460
Subtract two jobs.

568
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:05,167
It's surprisingly effective.

569
00:32:05,216 --> 00:32:07,626
Promise me we'll never be like them.

570
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:08,797
Like who?

571
00:32:08,845 --> 00:32:10,605
All those awful couples we know.

572
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:14,598
Those wives who treat their men
like dancing monkeys...

573
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:16,102
To be trained and paraded.

574
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:19,437
Husbands who treat their wives
like the highway patrol...

575
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:22,404
To be out-foxed and avoided.

576
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,824
I think I'm gonna be laid off.

577
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,405
We're in a recession.
If it happens, we'll deal with it.

578
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,661
I'll probably be next.

579
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:35,954
We have each other.

580
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,870
Everything else is background noise.

581
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,749
You are exceptional.

582
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:50,718
My turn.

583
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:56,057
My parents' publisher dropped them,
and they're in debt up to their ears.

584
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,930
That's terrible.

585
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:59,396
And they need to borrow
from my trust fund.

586
00:32:59,437 --> 00:33:00,937
How much?

587
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,190
Almost a million.

588
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:05,364
That's almost all of it.

589
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:07,701
This is where you say,
"everything else is background noise."

590
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:08,777
Amy, if you're laid off...

591
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,196
And I'm laid off...

592
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:11,369
I said I'd do it.

593
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:12,657
Without talking to me?

594
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,280
- Well, it's...
- Your call.

595
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:15,907
Their money, technically.

596
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,003
You know what? You're right.

597
00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:24,627
Everything else
is just background noise.

598
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:34,596
Hey.

599
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:39,886
More games?

600
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:41,556
Yeah, I just wanted to shoot some folks.

601
00:33:42,772 --> 00:33:44,232
What's the laptop for?

602
00:33:45,316 --> 00:33:46,316
Laptop-ing.

603
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:49,489
I see.

604
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:52,529
You can give your parents $879,000
without talking to me...

605
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:55,704
But God forbid I buy a video game
without getting your permission.

606
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:56,793
You are spending a lot.

607
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:59,077
You don't trust me.
You don't trust my judgment.

608
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,682
You certainly don't trust my intention.

609
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:01,666
What are you talking about?

610
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,327
That's the basic tenet
of a prenup, isn't it?

611
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:05,626
Why are you throwing that
in my face again?

612
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,210
Because it's easy to throw.

613
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:08,055
Nick, I don't get it.

614
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:11,429
I don't get why you're daring me
to be someone I don't wanna be.

615
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:14,547
The nagging shrew.
The controlling bitch.

616
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:16,965
I'm not that person. I'm your wife.

617
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:18,184
I'm sorry.

618
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:20,564
I just don't know how to do this.
I've never not had a job.

619
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,601
I flipped burgers, I painted houses.

620
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:24,655
You'll get another job.

621
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:30,278
Hi, go.

622
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:33,779
What? Hold on. What?

623
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:35,243
- And suddenly...
- Slow down, what is it?

624
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:37,283
I knew everything
was about to get worse.

625
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:38,906
Okay, tell me what's wrong.

626
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:07,772
- Bless you, Nick.
- Father.

627
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:09,861
Hey, tom. Mayor!

628
00:35:09,901 --> 00:35:11,151
Nick, good to see you.

629
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:12,194
Good to see you.

630
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:13,486
Hey, guys, hey.

631
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:17,407
- Jodie.
- Nick.

632
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:20,738
Oh, we'll find her.

633
00:35:35,718 --> 00:35:37,428
You look like hammered shit.

634
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,140
Thank you.

635
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,950
You ever see that guy
in the glasses before?

636
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:52,357
Don't worry. We videotape everybody
that comes in and out of these things.

637
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:54,191
I mean, you tend to get a lot of...

638
00:35:54,237 --> 00:35:55,277
Do-gooders?

639
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:56,531
Freaks.

640
00:35:56,572 --> 00:35:58,532
Hey, I meant to ask you.

641
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:00,034
Noelle hawthorne?

642
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,630
She lives on your street.
Amy's best friend.

643
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:05,076
I've never heard the name
noelle hawthorne.

644
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:07,292
She and her husband have triplets.

645
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:08,213
Oh.

646
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:11,456
Yeah, we might say hi to them
on the street.

647
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:14,008
But "best friend"? No.

648
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:15,759
Excuse me, one sec.

649
00:36:20,054 --> 00:36:22,144
He acted like
noelle was a complete stranger.

650
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:23,271
Of course he did.

651
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:24,931
Look, these two are yours.

652
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:27,346
Oh, look. He's being a good guy...

653
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:29,315
So everybody can see him
being a good guy.

654
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:31,145
You really don't like him, do you?

655
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,690
What's to like?

656
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:58,010
This mailbox is currently full.
Press one to...

657
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,430
Nick? I just wanted to introduce myself.
My name's shawna Kelly.

658
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:04,389
I am so sorry for your troubles.

659
00:37:04,432 --> 00:37:05,353
Thank you. That's kind.

660
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:06,811
Are you remembering to eat?

661
00:37:06,851 --> 00:37:07,981
Well, a lot of cold cuts.

662
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:12,189
I'm gonna fix you up
my world-famous chicken frito pie.

663
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:13,751
That's very kind and very unnecessary.

664
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:15,404
You have to keep your strength.

665
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:16,903
Would you...

666
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,700
Say, "chicken frito pie!"

667
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,200
You know what?

668
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:27,834
Would you delete that picture for me?

669
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:29,752
- It's a nice photo.
- I know it is.

670
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,210
But just do me a favor.

671
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,000
Will you?

672
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:35,964
Would you go ahead
and please delete that picture?

673
00:37:36,005 --> 00:37:36,686
You just press...

674
00:37:37,048 --> 00:37:38,548
What is wrong with you?

675
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:39,881
Could you please not
share that with anyone?

676
00:37:39,926 --> 00:37:43,256
I will share it with whomever I please.

677
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:48,428
- Dude.
- Yeah?

678
00:37:48,476 --> 00:37:49,806
Marybeth is pissed.

679
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,310
Why?

680
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,770
Marybeth?

681
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:59,236
It's like you're the goddamn
homecoming king.

682
00:38:01,656 --> 00:38:04,116
It was important to my mother
that I be polite...

683
00:38:04,158 --> 00:38:06,078
I be considerate, I be a gentleman.

684
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:07,828
It looked like you were having fun.

685
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:10,120
I am in a nightmare!

686
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:13,251
All I'm trying to do is be nice...

687
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:17,002
To the people who are
volunteering to help find Amy.

688
00:38:18,965 --> 00:38:20,725
You're right.

689
00:38:21,592 --> 00:38:23,552
And I'm sorry.

690
00:38:25,555 --> 00:38:29,185
My God, this place literally
smells like feces.

691
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:43,492
In your searches,
did you find any golf clubs, real fancy?

692
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:44,951
No.

693
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:47,785
How about a brand new stratocaster?

694
00:38:47,827 --> 00:38:48,947
No, nothing like that.

695
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:51,752
Well, all right.

696
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:59,802
How big's that TV? It's not 65-inch.

697
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,129
No, it's nowhere near that.

698
00:39:01,174 --> 00:39:02,264
Okay.

699
00:39:02,717 --> 00:39:04,127
- Kibble?
- Excuse me?

700
00:39:04,177 --> 00:39:06,257
He asked me to feed his cat.

701
00:39:06,304 --> 00:39:07,514
I saw some in the pantry.

702
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:12,597
Detective boney, officer gilpin?
Noelle hawthorne!

703
00:39:12,643 --> 00:39:14,233
I know y'all are in there!

704
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:18,770
Would you please escort miss hawthorne
and her children back out to the street?

705
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,740
Detective boney!

706
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:25,607
Just remind her
it is a possible crime scene.

707
00:39:34,332 --> 00:39:39,172
Look at that pie-eating grin,
from a guy whose wife is missing.

708
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:46,547
- How are you doing?
- Terrific.

709
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:49,814
How's marybeth?

710
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:51,677
She's a wreck.

711
00:39:51,724 --> 00:39:53,184
And you?

712
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:55,439
Awesome.

713
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:56,438
Hey...

714
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:58,059
Have you told me everything?

715
00:39:58,314 --> 00:39:59,274
Of course.

716
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:00,275
Everything?

717
00:40:00,316 --> 00:40:01,476
Why would you even ask me that?

718
00:40:01,526 --> 00:40:05,696
Ever since you walked into the bar that
morning Amy went missing, you seem...

719
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:07,989
- Off.
- I am off.

720
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:12,373
Everybody's examining me
and projecting their shit on me.

721
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:15,831
All I want is to come over here,
have a beer with you...

722
00:40:15,873 --> 00:40:17,213
And not be judged.

723
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,750
Can we do that?

724
00:40:19,836 --> 00:40:21,166
Of course.

725
00:40:22,547 --> 00:40:24,547
You know what I keep thinking?

726
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,630
If mom were here?

727
00:40:25,675 --> 00:40:29,095
Yeah. Like I'm 12.

728
00:40:30,555 --> 00:40:33,355
Nick, mom would fix it.

729
00:40:40,565 --> 00:40:43,785
I'm gonna go Benadryl myself to sleep.

730
00:40:46,696 --> 00:40:49,026
- Love you.
- Love you.

731
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:55,409
So, here's a strange, new sentence.

732
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:58,924
I am a missourian.

733
00:41:05,715 --> 00:41:07,095
Bye, dad.

734
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,470
No money, no jobs, no prospects.

735
00:41:12,513 --> 00:41:14,683
And then, we heard from go.

736
00:41:14,724 --> 00:41:16,644
Mama Maureen...

737
00:41:16,684 --> 00:41:19,524
Stage 4 breast cancer.

738
00:41:21,689 --> 00:41:24,529
So, we moved to Missouri.

739
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:26,187
I don't mind.

740
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:29,405
I just wish he'd asked.

741
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:43,543
Nick is happy to be home.

742
00:41:43,586 --> 00:41:46,086
But I don't know
if he's happy I'm with him.

743
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:50,840
I feel like something
he loaded by mistake.

744
00:41:50,885 --> 00:41:54,055
Something to be jettisoned,
if necessary.

745
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:56,306
Something disposable.

746
00:41:58,142 --> 00:42:00,772
I feel like I could disappear.

747
00:42:44,772 --> 00:42:46,772
Oh, my God!

748
00:42:46,816 --> 00:42:48,776
- I saw you on TV.
- Okay.

749
00:42:48,818 --> 00:42:50,488
- It's so crazy.
- Yeah, I know.

750
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:52,738
- She just vanished?
- She's just gone.

751
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,620
- I've been so worried about you.
- Where have you been?

752
00:42:54,657 --> 00:42:56,487
I called you a hundred times.
You gotta pick up your phone!

753
00:42:56,534 --> 00:42:57,584
Rehearsals.

754
00:42:57,618 --> 00:42:58,658
What?

755
00:42:58,703 --> 00:43:00,003
Godspell.

756
00:43:01,831 --> 00:43:03,421
My sister's asleep in the other room.

757
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:04,577
I needed to see you.

758
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:06,285
I know this is a bad idea.

759
00:43:06,335 --> 00:43:07,835
Can you at least tell me you love me?

760
00:43:07,879 --> 00:43:11,629
I do love you, but we have
to be really careful right now.

761
00:43:11,674 --> 00:43:12,934
I've been so scared.

762
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:14,177
Between rehearsals?

763
00:43:14,218 --> 00:43:15,968
You told me
I needed to have my own life.

764
00:43:16,012 --> 00:43:17,512
I know.

765
00:43:17,555 --> 00:43:18,815
We need to stop.

766
00:43:18,848 --> 00:43:20,018
I need you.

767
00:43:21,142 --> 00:43:22,982
Touch me.

768
00:43:26,397 --> 00:43:29,017
Stop it. Come here.

769
00:43:30,401 --> 00:43:32,111
Sit down.

770
00:43:32,153 --> 00:43:33,493
Okay.

771
00:43:33,529 --> 00:43:37,619
Did you, by any chance,
tell anybody anything about us?

772
00:43:37,658 --> 00:43:39,158
Even in texting, or on Facebook.

773
00:43:39,202 --> 00:43:42,002
Facebook? I use the disposable phone.

774
00:43:42,038 --> 00:43:43,958
You buy my presents in cash.
I'm not stupid, Nick.

775
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:46,878
I know, sweetie. Did you leave a
pair of red panties in my office?

776
00:43:46,918 --> 00:43:50,338
I don't know. Maybe.
They better be mine.

777
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:51,339
Sweetheart, think.

778
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,840
I don't know. I'd have to check
my red panty inventory.

779
00:43:53,883 --> 00:43:56,513
Andie, I need you
to take this seriously, okay?

780
00:43:56,552 --> 00:43:58,352
This is the last time
we're gonna see each other, until...

781
00:43:58,387 --> 00:43:59,847
Until when?

782
00:44:00,389 --> 00:44:01,849
Until it's safe.

783
00:44:01,891 --> 00:44:03,481
You were going to get a divorce.

784
00:44:03,518 --> 00:44:05,688
Never say that out loud again.

785
00:44:05,728 --> 00:44:08,398
Okay. I'm sorry.

786
00:44:09,273 --> 00:44:10,233
I don't wanna fight.

787
00:44:12,276 --> 00:44:13,856
I just wanna be with you.

788
00:44:13,903 --> 00:44:15,073
Andie, please...

789
00:44:15,905 --> 00:44:17,575
That's all I want.

790
00:44:18,908 --> 00:44:19,988
I can't.

791
00:44:22,328 --> 00:44:24,578
It's our last time together.

792
00:44:24,622 --> 00:44:26,672
Let's make the most of it.

793
00:44:33,422 --> 00:44:36,762
Real quick, but then you have to go.

794
00:44:39,595 --> 00:44:42,385
My husband has come undone.

795
00:44:42,431 --> 00:44:45,391
We moved to Missouri to save Maureen...

796
00:44:45,434 --> 00:44:48,154
But as it turns out, we couldn't.

797
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,190
It means a lot that you came.

798
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,740
We took a hit on the brownstone...

799
00:44:55,778 --> 00:44:58,108
And I used the last of my trust fund
to buy him a bar.

800
00:44:58,865 --> 00:45:01,125
So far, it's just costing money.

801
00:45:05,329 --> 00:45:09,119
Nick uses me for sex when he wants.

802
00:45:12,295 --> 00:45:14,805
Otherwise, I don't exist.

803
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:18,128
We should go to outback tonight.

804
00:45:18,176 --> 00:45:19,426
That would be nice.

805
00:45:19,468 --> 00:45:22,548
Last night, I went from desperate
to pathetic.

806
00:45:23,472 --> 00:45:26,642
I became someone I don't even like.

807
00:45:26,684 --> 00:45:28,484
The kind of woman I used to mock.

808
00:45:28,895 --> 00:45:30,605
You're out so much.

809
00:45:30,646 --> 00:45:32,976
- I know.
- Stay home.

810
00:45:33,024 --> 00:45:35,364
- I can't, I'm already late.
- Then, can I come?

811
00:45:35,401 --> 00:45:37,191
You would hate it.

812
00:45:37,236 --> 00:45:40,486
It's a bunch
of my dorky high school friends.

813
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,370
Do our code. No bullshit.

814
00:45:44,827 --> 00:45:47,197
I thought
we weren't gonna be that couple.

815
00:45:53,711 --> 00:45:55,551
Okay, bye.

816
00:45:57,215 --> 00:46:00,185
- Hey, I've been thinking.
- Yeah?

817
00:46:00,218 --> 00:46:01,588
Something positive.

818
00:46:03,012 --> 00:46:04,052
Maybe it's time.

819
00:46:05,348 --> 00:46:07,178
Now is literally the worst time.

820
00:46:07,225 --> 00:46:08,465
It would be a new start for us.

821
00:46:08,684 --> 00:46:11,404
And for me,
I would have a real purpose here.

822
00:46:11,437 --> 00:46:12,647
A child is not a hobby.

823
00:46:12,688 --> 00:46:13,688
Not a hobby.

824
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:15,900
An inspiration.

825
00:46:16,442 --> 00:46:19,572
We could have had this fight
four hours ago. I'm late.

826
00:46:19,612 --> 00:46:20,862
I didn't know it was gonna be a fight.

827
00:46:20,905 --> 00:46:24,325
You really wanna be the couple
that has a baby to save their marriage?

828
00:46:24,367 --> 00:46:25,367
"Save"?

829
00:46:25,868 --> 00:46:28,038
Reboot, retool, rekindle, whatever!

830
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,249
- And you're gonna walk out the door now?
- Yeah!

831
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:32,829
You're a fucking coward.

832
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:34,745
No, it can't go on like this.

833
00:46:34,794 --> 00:46:35,844
Really?

834
00:46:35,878 --> 00:46:37,378
- I won't.
- You won't?

835
00:46:37,421 --> 00:46:39,761
You won't?
Why, it's not good enough for you?

836
00:46:39,799 --> 00:46:40,719
It's not even close!

837
00:46:40,758 --> 00:46:42,888
You stupid bitch!

838
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:46,429
What scared me
wasn't that he'd pushed me.

839
00:46:46,472 --> 00:46:50,312
What scared me was how much
he wanted to hurt me more.

840
00:46:50,643 --> 00:46:52,733
What scared me
was that I'd finally realized...

841
00:46:53,729 --> 00:46:57,399
I am frightened of my own husband.

842
00:47:09,287 --> 00:47:10,787
You want me to call for backup?

843
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:12,920
Nah, I'll protect you.

844
00:47:20,673 --> 00:47:22,093
Jesus.

845
00:47:27,138 --> 00:47:29,808
They ought to burn this place down.

846
00:47:30,266 --> 00:47:31,926
Seems like folks are trying.

847
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,730
You really think this is anything?

848
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,935
Cross it off the list.

849
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:54,749
Hey, Jason.

850
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:56,330
What's up, Rhonda?

851
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:58,625
"...and dedicated to the proposition
that all men..."

852
00:47:59,712 --> 00:48:02,212
- Have you seen this girl around here?
- Why do you ask?

853
00:48:02,465 --> 00:48:04,305
She was reported missing.

854
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:09,350
"...and so dedicated, can long endure."

855
00:48:09,388 --> 00:48:11,308
Yeah. I remember her.

856
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:13,479
What did she want? Weed, pills?

857
00:48:15,144 --> 00:48:16,154
She wanted a gun.

858
00:48:16,395 --> 00:48:18,435
I told her it's not my thing.

859
00:48:18,481 --> 00:48:21,481
I felt bad, though.
She seemed really desperate.

860
00:48:21,526 --> 00:48:25,106
She said it needed to be small,
so she could keep it close.

861
00:48:25,154 --> 00:48:26,994
Are you sure this is her?

862
00:48:27,031 --> 00:48:29,161
You don't forget a girl like that
in here.

863
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:31,659
She was all in pink.

864
00:48:31,702 --> 00:48:34,252
It was Valentine's day.

865
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:39,958
For Valentine's day,
I thought I'd buy a gun.

866
00:48:40,002 --> 00:48:42,592
That is how crazy I've become.

867
00:48:43,673 --> 00:48:47,803
Nick wants me gone
but he won't ask for a divorce.

868
00:48:47,844 --> 00:48:51,974
In his mind, I'm the owner of his bar,
his only line of credit.

869
00:48:52,014 --> 00:48:53,524
The bitch with the prenup.

870
00:48:55,351 --> 00:48:57,691
I could go home to my parents...

871
00:48:57,728 --> 00:49:00,148
But I'd have to tell them the truth.

872
00:49:00,189 --> 00:49:04,029
And I don't even know
if I believe the truth.

873
00:49:04,068 --> 00:49:06,858
Can I really think Nick would hurt me?

874
00:49:07,488 --> 00:49:09,868
I'm being paranoid. Crazy.

875
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:11,870
It's just...

876
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,700
I'd sleep better with a gun.

877
00:49:26,591 --> 00:49:28,011
Oh, shit.

878
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:31,680
Wake up, baby.
My sister's gonna come out here.

879
00:49:36,058 --> 00:49:38,268
- Sorry to rush you.
- It's okay.

880
00:49:40,229 --> 00:49:41,729
- Here. Let me help you.
- Okay.

881
00:49:41,772 --> 00:49:43,862
Just get that.

882
00:49:46,527 --> 00:49:48,027
Be very careful.

883
00:49:48,863 --> 00:49:49,863
I'm all right.

884
00:49:49,906 --> 00:49:52,486
Here you go.

885
00:49:52,533 --> 00:49:54,413
Promise me we'll talk every day.

886
00:49:54,452 --> 00:49:55,702
Okay, we will.

887
00:49:55,745 --> 00:49:58,465
Every day, Nick, or I'll go crazy.

888
00:49:59,248 --> 00:50:00,328
Don't go crazy.

889
00:50:00,374 --> 00:50:01,634
Okay.

890
00:50:06,047 --> 00:50:09,377
You fucking idiot.

891
00:50:09,425 --> 00:50:13,255
You fucking asshole!
You fucking lied to my fucking face!

892
00:50:14,764 --> 00:50:16,314
I'm sorry.

893
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,060
How old is she?

894
00:50:19,435 --> 00:50:20,635
She's in her early 20s.

895
00:50:21,562 --> 00:50:22,402
How long?

896
00:50:23,105 --> 00:50:25,895
- A year and a half.
- You lied to me for over a year?

897
00:50:25,942 --> 00:50:27,622
If I told you,
you would have made me stop.

898
00:50:27,652 --> 00:50:29,242
It's so fucking small.

899
00:50:29,278 --> 00:50:32,238
You're a liar and a cheat!
You're just like dad!

900
00:50:32,281 --> 00:50:33,571
How did you even meet her?

901
00:50:33,616 --> 00:50:34,826
She's one of my students.

902
00:50:36,077 --> 00:50:37,747
I thought writers hated clichés.

903
00:50:37,787 --> 00:50:38,617
I'm not a writer.

904
00:50:38,663 --> 00:50:40,913
"Boo-hoo, I got laid off.
I guess I'll fuck a teenager."

905
00:50:40,957 --> 00:50:43,747
It wasn't like that, okay? You have
no idea how shitty it was with Amy...

906
00:50:43,793 --> 00:50:45,713
How fucking terrible she made me feel.

907
00:50:45,753 --> 00:50:48,923
Flyover boy.
I would get knots in my stomach...

908
00:50:48,965 --> 00:50:50,805
Just coming home,
knowing she would be sitting there...

909
00:50:50,842 --> 00:50:53,003
Dissatisfied, before I even
walked in the fucking door.

910
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:54,430
This is so bad.

911
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:56,560
If anybody finds out,
you're totally fucked.

912
00:50:56,597 --> 00:50:59,217
Boney found a pair of panties
in my office...

913
00:50:59,267 --> 00:51:00,807
Where, occasionally, Andie and I...

914
00:51:01,269 --> 00:51:02,389
I don't know what the fuck it means.

915
00:51:02,436 --> 00:51:03,596
Are they super-twat's?

916
00:51:03,646 --> 00:51:05,726
Her name is Andie.

917
00:51:05,773 --> 00:51:07,273
She's not entirely sure.

918
00:51:07,316 --> 00:51:08,976
So we are dealing with a 20-year-old...

919
00:51:09,026 --> 00:51:10,436
Who isn't sure
where she leaves her undies?

920
00:51:10,486 --> 00:51:12,736
If they're not Andie's,
that means that they're Amy's...

921
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,490
And she left them there for me to find.

922
00:51:14,532 --> 00:51:18,292
Nick, I was scared for you before,
and now, I'm fucking petrified.

923
00:51:18,327 --> 00:51:20,617
We're having a vigil tonight
for your missing wife...

924
00:51:20,663 --> 00:51:23,793
And this morning, you're kissing
your college girlfriend goodbye!

925
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:25,003
Can you imagine?

926
00:51:25,626 --> 00:51:28,956
Have you watched television lately?

927
00:51:29,005 --> 00:51:32,015
Cable news is all over your shit.

928
00:51:32,633 --> 00:51:34,473
I mean, what is wrong with this barkeep?

929
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:36,800
His wife's nowhere to be found...

930
00:51:36,846 --> 00:51:40,516
And here's Nick dunne for you, flirting.
Cute pic, huh?

931
00:51:40,558 --> 00:51:43,018
- Who is that?
- Some fucking tragedy groupie.

932
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,980
- Who the fuck is that?
- I don't know.

933
00:51:45,021 --> 00:51:46,151
She was trying to give me a casserole.

934
00:51:46,189 --> 00:51:49,319
On the show today
we have defense attorney, Tanner bolt...

935
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:51,898
Patron Saint to wife-killers everywhere.

936
00:51:52,195 --> 00:51:55,705
Tanner bolt, would you actually consider
defending Nick dunne?

937
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:56,870
Well, let me just say...

938
00:51:56,908 --> 00:51:59,658
As always, Ellen,
thank you for such a warm welcome.

939
00:51:59,702 --> 00:52:01,252
But of course, I'd defend Nick dunne.

940
00:52:01,537 --> 00:52:04,037
Listen, just because this guy
isn't walking around weeping...

941
00:52:04,081 --> 00:52:05,501
That doesn't mean that he's not hurting.

942
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:08,881
Tanner, the hallmark of a sociopath
is a lack of empathy.

943
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,880
But the truth is,
you'd have to be a sociopath...

944
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,170
To behave normally in this situation...

945
00:52:13,216 --> 00:52:15,966
Because it's the most
abnormal situation in the world.

946
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:18,680
Tanner, are you trying to tell me
that this photo...

947
00:52:18,721 --> 00:52:20,971
Is remotely in the realm
of acceptable behavior?

948
00:52:21,015 --> 00:52:23,675
I'm so sick
of being picked apart by women.

949
00:52:25,061 --> 00:52:26,941
You need to hire Tanner bolt.

950
00:52:29,023 --> 00:52:29,823
I don't deserve this.

951
00:52:29,857 --> 00:52:31,727
Innocent until proven guilty.

952
00:52:31,776 --> 00:52:34,146
That's exactly what you deserve.

953
00:52:34,195 --> 00:52:35,745
Go home, Nick.

954
00:53:01,722 --> 00:53:03,142
Hey, buddy.

955
00:53:19,031 --> 00:53:20,821
I can't believe
we haven't arrested this guy.

956
00:53:20,867 --> 00:53:22,827
We're not gonna arrest anybody...

957
00:53:22,869 --> 00:53:24,430
Just because some blonde dunce says so.

958
00:53:24,787 --> 00:53:27,287
Why are you going so easy on him?
You got a crush?

959
00:53:27,582 --> 00:53:30,922
One, I am conducting an investigation,
not a witch-hunt.

960
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,880
And, two,
don't talk to me that way, ever.

961
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,210
She was trying to buy a gun.

962
00:53:34,255 --> 00:53:36,425
We don't know who
or what was scaring her, gil.

963
00:53:36,465 --> 00:53:37,375
Give me the update.

964
00:53:37,967 --> 00:53:40,587
No drug angles panned out yet,
so cross that off the list.

965
00:53:40,636 --> 00:53:42,596
I talked to the nurses
who care for Nick's father.

966
00:53:42,638 --> 00:53:45,348
The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as
a kitten, so cross that off the list.

967
00:53:45,391 --> 00:53:46,561
- Hey.
- Hey.

968
00:53:46,601 --> 00:53:50,021
So, luminol lit up the kitchen
like the 4th of July.

969
00:53:50,062 --> 00:53:51,362
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

970
00:53:51,397 --> 00:53:52,517
The blood is profuse.

971
00:53:52,565 --> 00:53:54,785
It is Amy's, type b,
and we should have DNA soon.

972
00:53:54,817 --> 00:53:55,897
Thoughts on a weapon?

973
00:53:55,943 --> 00:53:57,863
Trajectory indicates blunt force.

974
00:53:57,904 --> 00:54:00,244
Maybe a club or a two-by-four.

975
00:54:00,823 --> 00:54:04,083
She fell there,
but I doubt she got back up.

976
00:54:04,118 --> 00:54:05,538
Amy's medical records come in?

977
00:54:05,578 --> 00:54:07,578
No, we'll have them later tonight.

978
00:54:09,165 --> 00:54:10,585
My wife says he's a killer.

979
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:13,173
Well, if Tiffany says...

980
00:54:38,778 --> 00:54:39,778
Hey.

981
00:54:40,112 --> 00:54:41,112
Hey.

982
00:54:45,535 --> 00:54:46,695
Thank you all for coming out.

983
00:54:48,371 --> 00:54:50,001
Hey Donnie, how are you?

984
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:53,379
Rich, thank you so much.

985
00:55:00,675 --> 00:55:01,685
Hey.

986
00:55:08,724 --> 00:55:12,314
Thank you, folks.
Thank you for being here tonight.

987
00:55:12,353 --> 00:55:14,153
It just means the world to our family.

988
00:55:14,689 --> 00:55:16,149
And to Amy.

989
00:55:16,732 --> 00:55:18,732
As you all know...

990
00:55:19,569 --> 00:55:22,859
My wife, Amy elliott dunne...

991
00:55:22,905 --> 00:55:24,405
Disappeared three days ago.

992
00:55:24,991 --> 00:55:28,541
And I want to implore anyone
who has any information at all...

993
00:55:28,578 --> 00:55:31,498
Please come forward. Help us.

994
00:55:31,539 --> 00:55:32,459
So hot.

995
00:55:32,498 --> 00:55:33,868
He is so creepy.

996
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:37,376
I wanna say something, because I think
some of you might be wondering...

997
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:39,340
And are too polite to ask.

998
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:42,929
I had nothing to do
with the disappearance of my wife.

999
00:55:43,509 --> 00:55:45,469
I'm cooperating with the police.

1000
00:55:45,511 --> 00:55:47,551
I haven't hired a lawyer.

1001
00:55:47,597 --> 00:55:48,717
I have nothing to hide.

1002
00:55:50,016 --> 00:55:52,516
Amy is my soul mate.

1003
00:55:52,768 --> 00:55:54,058
She is brilliant...

1004
00:55:54,604 --> 00:55:57,694
She's charming, and wise.

1005
00:55:58,024 --> 00:55:59,734
I love you, Amy.

1006
00:56:03,863 --> 00:56:04,953
Asshole.

1007
00:56:06,282 --> 00:56:08,202
I love my wife...

1008
00:56:08,576 --> 00:56:09,786
So much.

1009
00:56:12,288 --> 00:56:16,628
And I may not behave for the cameras
the way they want me to...

1010
00:56:17,043 --> 00:56:20,253
And if they wanna punish me for that,
that's okay.

1011
00:56:20,296 --> 00:56:24,006
But I just wanna ask you in the media,
please, harass me...

1012
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:27,090
But don't harass
the people of this town.

1013
00:56:27,136 --> 00:56:29,176
If you need to mock somebody, mock me.

1014
00:56:29,222 --> 00:56:30,432
Nick!

1015
00:56:30,473 --> 00:56:32,634
But please don't turn this investigation
into a circus.

1016
00:56:32,642 --> 00:56:34,232
Where's your wife, Nick?

1017
00:56:34,268 --> 00:56:35,768
Let the police do their jobs.

1018
00:56:36,229 --> 00:56:37,809
What did you do to your pregnant wife?

1019
00:56:39,649 --> 00:56:40,899
Did you tell them that, Nick?

1020
00:56:40,942 --> 00:56:42,992
Did you tell them
Amy was six weeks pregnant?

1021
00:56:46,739 --> 00:56:48,909
Thank you for your support tonight.
Let's find Amy.

1022
00:56:51,077 --> 00:56:52,717
Go ahead,
if you guys wanna say something.

1023
00:56:56,791 --> 00:56:58,171
Gil, go, go.

1024
00:57:00,503 --> 00:57:01,633
Nick, where are you going?

1025
00:57:01,671 --> 00:57:03,261
Stop him!

1026
00:57:03,297 --> 00:57:05,507
No questions right now. Thank you.

1027
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:09,550
Why are you running away?

1028
00:57:10,638 --> 00:57:12,058
Don't run.

1029
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,140
Everybody, stay back.

1030
00:57:18,938 --> 00:57:21,108
Guys, come on. You know better.

1031
00:57:21,148 --> 00:57:23,608
Get off the grass, get down to the curb.

1032
00:57:23,651 --> 00:57:25,071
- Hey, gil...
- On it.

1033
00:57:25,111 --> 00:57:26,151
All right.

1034
00:57:26,195 --> 00:57:27,985
All right, y'all heard her. No pictures.

1035
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:29,320
Hello?

1036
00:57:30,074 --> 00:57:31,624
Hello?

1037
00:57:31,659 --> 00:57:32,489
Fuck.

1038
00:57:32,535 --> 00:57:34,045
You scared me. Want a drink?

1039
00:57:34,078 --> 00:57:35,578
Did you know she was pregnant?

1040
00:57:35,621 --> 00:57:37,751
I told you,
noelle hawthorne is fucking crazy.

1041
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:38,830
She doesn't even know Amy.

1042
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,101
They look like pretty good friends
to me.

1043
00:57:48,676 --> 00:57:52,096
Look, I don't know. But it certainly
doesn't prove that she's pregnant.

1044
00:57:52,138 --> 00:57:53,348
We have her medical records coming.

1045
00:57:53,389 --> 00:57:55,269
- Good.
- So, let's talk while we wait.

1046
00:57:55,308 --> 00:57:57,518
Let's start over here.
The scene of the crime.

1047
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,440
You see, we've seen dozens
of home invasions.

1048
00:58:00,479 --> 00:58:02,439
Dozens and dozens.

1049
00:58:02,481 --> 00:58:04,691
This area right here, it looked wrong
from the second we saw it.

1050
00:58:04,734 --> 00:58:07,904
The whole thing looked staged.
Watch this.

1051
00:58:09,822 --> 00:58:13,242
And yet, they remained upright
throughout this life-and-death struggle?

1052
00:58:13,659 --> 00:58:15,409
I don't know.
What do you want me to say?

1053
00:58:15,453 --> 00:58:17,083
Did you do any housekeeping
the day your wife went missing?

1054
00:58:17,121 --> 00:58:18,081
No.

1055
00:58:18,122 --> 00:58:20,372
Because our guys did a luminol test.

1056
00:58:20,416 --> 00:58:23,086
And I'm sorry to tell you,
but that kitchen lit up.

1057
00:58:23,127 --> 00:58:25,377
Amy lost a lot of blood in there, Nick.
A lot.

1058
00:58:25,421 --> 00:58:26,381
Oh, my God.

1059
00:58:26,422 --> 00:58:27,762
Yeah, and then somebody mopped it up.

1060
00:58:27,798 --> 00:58:30,258
Wait a second.
Why would they mop up the blood...

1061
00:58:30,301 --> 00:58:31,902
If they're trying to stage
a crime scene?

1062
00:58:31,928 --> 00:58:34,678
No blood and no body
suggests kidnapping.

1063
00:58:34,722 --> 00:58:37,142
It tells us,
look at people outside the house.

1064
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,603
Like these homeless you keep mentioning.

1065
00:58:38,643 --> 00:58:41,733
A pool of blood and no body
suggests homicide.

1066
00:58:41,771 --> 00:58:43,771
It tells us to look at people
inside the house.

1067
00:58:43,814 --> 00:58:46,534
- Which is what we're doing here, Nick.
- I see.

1068
00:58:46,567 --> 00:58:49,527
So, how was your marriage, Nick?
Because right now, all we got is noelle.

1069
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:51,110
She says, "not good."

1070
00:58:51,155 --> 00:58:52,655
Gil, what do you and your wife
argue about?

1071
00:58:52,698 --> 00:58:54,828
- What pisses you off?
- Money, lack thereof.

1072
00:58:54,867 --> 00:58:56,617
Me and my ex, it's the same.

1073
00:58:56,661 --> 00:59:00,001
I mention that because
we got a look at your finances, Nick.

1074
00:59:00,039 --> 00:59:02,749
$117,000 in credit card debt.

1075
00:59:02,792 --> 00:59:04,752
- What?
- I pulled up some of the merchandise.

1076
00:59:04,794 --> 00:59:06,804
There are these fun little splurges.

1077
00:59:06,838 --> 00:59:08,378
I didn't buy any of this stuff.

1078
00:59:08,422 --> 00:59:09,552
I don't even golf!

1079
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:10,920
I do! You bought great clubs.

1080
00:59:10,967 --> 00:59:12,257
I like the robot dog.

1081
00:59:12,301 --> 00:59:14,261
This is identity theft!
This is a felony!

1082
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,263
We need to find out who did this!

1083
00:59:15,304 --> 00:59:17,064
All right.
Let's talk about life insurance.

1084
00:59:17,098 --> 00:59:19,638
Because in April,
you bumped up Amy's life insurance...

1085
00:59:19,684 --> 00:59:20,684
To $1.2 million.

1086
00:59:20,726 --> 00:59:23,096
Yes, I did. That was her idea.
She wanted me to.

1087
00:59:23,145 --> 00:59:24,305
You filed the paperwork.

1088
00:59:24,355 --> 00:59:25,555
Because she told me to!

1089
00:59:26,399 --> 00:59:27,319
Hold on a sec.

1090
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:29,148
Yeah? Okay.

1091
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:32,240
For sure?

1092
00:59:32,655 --> 00:59:33,825
All right.

1093
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:38,870
She was pregnant.

1094
00:59:42,999 --> 00:59:44,629
This is insane.

1095
00:59:44,667 --> 00:59:47,167
So, my question becomes...

1096
00:59:47,211 --> 00:59:50,131
I don't want to talk
to you again, ever...

1097
00:59:50,173 --> 00:59:51,343
Without a lawyer.

1098
00:59:59,682 --> 01:00:00,682
Margo!

1099
01:00:11,569 --> 01:00:12,569
Hey.

1100
01:00:14,947 --> 01:00:17,367
Just hold on a second. Let me finish.

1101
01:00:17,408 --> 01:00:18,328
Nick?

1102
01:00:18,367 --> 01:00:21,157
I hear you, I hear you.
I was as surprised as...

1103
01:00:21,204 --> 01:00:25,044
I know you're upset.
I had no idea she was pregnant.

1104
01:00:25,458 --> 01:00:28,588
Listen, I thought so, too,
but evidently that wasn't...

1105
01:00:31,088 --> 01:00:33,218
you want to know the truth?

1106
01:00:33,257 --> 01:00:35,627
The truth is, Amy didn't want kids.

1107
01:00:38,054 --> 01:00:40,104
Well, I'm as surprised as...

1108
01:00:41,432 --> 01:00:43,232
you told me you didn't want kids.

1109
01:00:44,227 --> 01:00:45,627
I was trying to put a good face on.

1110
01:00:45,645 --> 01:00:47,525
Then, suddenly,
you've got a pregnant wife.

1111
01:00:47,563 --> 01:00:48,903
That's a problem for you.

1112
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:52,030
Especially when you factor in
the secret teenage girlfriend.

1113
01:00:52,068 --> 01:00:53,528
Oh, stop watching Ellen abbott!

1114
01:00:53,569 --> 01:00:54,899
You have to fucking talk to me!

1115
01:00:57,573 --> 01:01:01,623
I didn't tell you that she didn't want kids
because she didn't want me to.

1116
01:01:01,661 --> 01:01:03,871
Because it would have just been
another reason for you to hate her.

1117
01:01:03,913 --> 01:01:05,793
And we had enough of those already!
It was easier to just...

1118
01:01:05,831 --> 01:01:08,041
- lie to me?
- I wanted kids!

1119
01:01:08,084 --> 01:01:10,254
When we first moved here,
I went to a fertility clinic!

1120
01:01:10,294 --> 01:01:11,964
- It didn't work?
- I did my part!

1121
01:01:12,004 --> 01:01:13,054
Masturbate.

1122
01:01:13,089 --> 01:01:14,799
When it came time for Amy to do her thing,
all of a sudden it was like...

1123
01:01:14,841 --> 01:01:16,381
"Well, I don't know. Maybe. No, thanks."

1124
01:01:16,425 --> 01:01:18,425
Now, who would believe you?

1125
01:01:19,595 --> 01:01:20,795
All right.

1126
01:01:30,439 --> 01:01:32,229
This is a letter from the clinic...

1127
01:01:32,275 --> 01:01:34,745
Notifying me
that they're gonna destroy my sample...

1128
01:01:34,777 --> 01:01:36,777
Unless I contact them.

1129
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:39,570
So, I gave it to Amy.

1130
01:01:39,615 --> 01:01:42,615
The next day, I saw it in the trash.

1131
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:44,240
But you were already with Andie
by then, right?

1132
01:01:44,287 --> 01:01:47,117
I wanted a baby with Amy.

1133
01:01:47,164 --> 01:01:51,344
A year ago, Amy being pregnant
would have been the best thing ever!

1134
01:01:57,884 --> 01:01:59,764
"When your poor Amy has a cold,
this dessert just..."

1135
01:01:59,802 --> 01:02:01,182
this is the clue you couldn't solve.

1136
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:02,350
Yeah.

1137
01:02:04,056 --> 01:02:07,426
A letter from desi.
That creepy boyfriend of Amy's?

1138
01:02:07,476 --> 01:02:09,846
It was the fucking rich guy
who would do anything for her.

1139
01:02:09,896 --> 01:02:11,856
It just kept hanging over my head.
It was disgusting.

1140
01:02:11,898 --> 01:02:12,858
Your prenup?

1141
01:02:13,232 --> 01:02:16,192
Nick, why have you kept this stuff?
It's like a little box of hate.

1142
01:02:16,235 --> 01:02:18,025
I don't know, go! Maybe I hate her!

1143
01:02:20,907 --> 01:02:24,027
I love you no matter what.

1144
01:02:24,076 --> 01:02:25,446
But you need to tell me.

1145
01:02:25,494 --> 01:02:26,914
Tell you what?

1146
01:02:27,747 --> 01:02:29,367
What are you asking me?

1147
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:34,128
Are you asking me
if I killed my wife, go?

1148
01:02:34,587 --> 01:02:36,667
Is that what you're asking me?
If I murdered my wife?

1149
01:02:36,714 --> 01:02:39,134
I would never ask you that!

1150
01:02:43,095 --> 01:02:44,095
Margo!

1151
01:02:56,901 --> 01:02:59,111
Don't walk on the glass.

1152
01:03:00,821 --> 01:03:03,451
You have no clue, do you?

1153
01:03:21,259 --> 01:03:22,839
Why was he here that night?

1154
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:27,310
His wife is missing. Why come here?

1155
01:03:27,348 --> 01:03:28,268
Who cares?

1156
01:03:28,558 --> 01:03:29,808
Rhonda, we got this.

1157
01:03:29,851 --> 01:03:31,351
Let's make the arrest.

1158
01:03:31,394 --> 01:03:33,484
Do you know how hard it is
to make a murder case without a body?

1159
01:03:33,521 --> 01:03:34,441
No.

1160
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,650
Well, it's incredibly hard.

1161
01:03:36,691 --> 01:03:39,571
So, I want one last thing.

1162
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:40,440
What's that?

1163
01:03:42,238 --> 01:03:44,528
I want a body.

1164
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:50,120
Picture me.
I'm a girl who's very, very bad.

1165
01:03:50,162 --> 01:03:51,792
Be careful.

1166
01:03:56,335 --> 01:04:00,755
I need to be punished,
and by "punished," I mean "had."

1167
01:04:05,303 --> 01:04:06,303
Fuck.

1168
01:04:08,264 --> 01:04:11,104
It's where you keep goodies
for anniversary five.

1169
01:04:12,351 --> 01:04:14,521
So, open the door...

1170
01:04:14,562 --> 01:04:15,942
Punish. Wood. Beach.

1171
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:18,480
And look alive.

1172
01:04:21,611 --> 01:04:24,201
Punish. Wood.

1173
01:04:25,364 --> 01:04:26,954
Wood.

1174
01:04:59,065 --> 01:05:01,785
I will practice believing
my husband loves me...

1175
01:05:01,817 --> 01:05:04,237
And will love this baby.

1176
01:05:04,904 --> 01:05:08,534
That this child
might really save our marriage.

1177
01:05:09,408 --> 01:05:10,868
But I could be wrong.

1178
01:05:17,041 --> 01:05:18,961
Because sometimes...

1179
01:05:19,961 --> 01:05:22,171
The way he looks at me...

1180
01:05:23,256 --> 01:05:25,006
I think...

1181
01:05:25,049 --> 01:05:26,129
Man of my dreams...

1182
01:05:28,052 --> 01:05:30,142
Father of my child...

1183
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:34,930
This man of mine may kill me.

1184
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:38,310
He may truly...

1185
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:39,980
Kill me.

1186
01:05:42,942 --> 01:05:43,822
Wtf?

1187
01:06:08,885 --> 01:06:11,475
I am so much happier now that I'm dead.

1188
01:06:16,517 --> 01:06:18,097
Technically, "missing."

1189
01:06:18,936 --> 01:06:20,596
Soon to be presumed dead.

1190
01:06:22,315 --> 01:06:23,445
Gone.

1191
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,650
And my lazy, lying, cheating,
oblivious husband...

1192
01:06:27,695 --> 01:06:30,985
Will go to prison for my murder.

1193
01:06:32,283 --> 01:06:34,833
Nick dunne took my pride
and my dignity...

1194
01:06:34,869 --> 01:06:37,369
And my hope and my money.

1195
01:06:37,413 --> 01:06:41,003
He took and took from me
until I no longer existed.

1196
01:06:41,042 --> 01:06:42,462
That's murder.

1197
01:06:42,502 --> 01:06:45,302
Let the punishment fit the crime.

1198
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:48,880
To fake a convincing murder,
you have to have discipline.

1199
01:06:53,095 --> 01:06:56,095
You befriend a local idiot.

1200
01:06:59,644 --> 01:07:02,814
Harvest the details
of her humdrum life.

1201
01:07:03,189 --> 01:07:06,779
And cram her with stories
about your husband's violent temper.

1202
01:07:07,902 --> 01:07:10,202
Secretly create some money troubles.

1203
01:07:10,446 --> 01:07:13,616
Credit cards, perhaps online gambling.

1204
01:07:16,244 --> 01:07:18,454
With the help of the unwitting...

1205
01:07:18,496 --> 01:07:20,496
Bump up your life insurance.

1206
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:25,378
Purchase getaway car. Craigslist.

1207
01:07:25,419 --> 01:07:28,709
Generic. Cheap. Pay cash.

1208
01:07:29,173 --> 01:07:33,803
You need to package yourself so that
people will truly mourn your loss.

1209
01:07:33,845 --> 01:07:36,815
And America loves pregnant women.

1210
01:07:37,139 --> 01:07:40,139
As if it's so hard to spread your legs.

1211
01:07:40,184 --> 01:07:41,484
You know what's hard?

1212
01:07:41,978 --> 01:07:43,938
Faking a pregnancy.

1213
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:46,150
First, drain your toilet.

1214
01:07:47,859 --> 01:07:50,609
Invite pregnant idiot into your home...

1215
01:07:50,653 --> 01:07:53,163
And ply her with lemonade.

1216
01:07:58,327 --> 01:08:00,497
Steal pregnant idiot's urine.

1217
01:08:02,707 --> 01:08:04,207
Voilà.

1218
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:08,210
A pregnancy is now part
of your legal medical record.

1219
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:16,049
Happy anniversary.

1220
01:08:18,723 --> 01:08:21,483
Wait for your clueless husband...

1221
01:08:21,517 --> 01:08:23,387
To start his day.

1222
01:08:24,854 --> 01:08:26,314
Off he goes.

1223
01:08:26,355 --> 01:08:28,515
And the clock is ticking.

1224
01:08:29,692 --> 01:08:32,192
Meticulously stage your crime scene...

1225
01:08:32,862 --> 01:08:36,872
With just enough mistakes
to raise the specter of doubt.

1226
01:08:38,284 --> 01:08:40,244
You need to bleed.

1227
01:08:40,578 --> 01:08:41,288
A lot.

1228
01:08:42,205 --> 01:08:43,875
A lot, a lot.

1229
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:49,040
A head wound kind of bleed.

1230
01:08:49,712 --> 01:08:52,212
A crime scene kind of bleed.

1231
01:08:55,218 --> 01:08:57,338
You need to clean poorly...

1232
01:08:57,386 --> 01:08:58,216
Like he would.

1233
01:08:59,096 --> 01:09:01,596
Clean and bleed. Bleed and clean.

1234
01:09:02,225 --> 01:09:04,815
And leave a little something behind.

1235
01:09:05,478 --> 01:09:07,228
A fire in July?

1236
01:09:08,773 --> 01:09:09,863
And because you're you...

1237
01:09:09,899 --> 01:09:11,149
You don't stop there.

1238
01:09:11,567 --> 01:09:13,777
You need a diary.

1239
01:09:13,819 --> 01:09:16,739
Minimum, 300 entries
on the Nick and Amy story.

1240
01:09:17,406 --> 01:09:19,696
Start with the fairy tale early days.

1241
01:09:19,742 --> 01:09:22,042
Those are true. And they're crucial.

1242
01:09:22,078 --> 01:09:24,078
You want Nick and Amy to be likeable.

1243
01:09:24,413 --> 01:09:27,043
After that, you invent.

1244
01:09:27,083 --> 01:09:28,043
The spending.

1245
01:09:28,084 --> 01:09:29,884
The abuse. The fear.

1246
01:09:29,919 --> 01:09:32,879
The threat of violence.

1247
01:09:32,922 --> 01:09:34,882
And Nick thought he was the writer.

1248
01:09:35,591 --> 01:09:36,881
Burn it just the right amount.

1249
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:40,599
Make sure the cops will find it.

1250
01:09:45,601 --> 01:09:48,651
Finally, honor tradition
with a very special treasure hunt.

1251
01:09:51,232 --> 01:09:54,032
And if I get everything right,
the world will hate Nick...

1252
01:09:54,068 --> 01:09:56,778
For killing his beautiful,
pregnant wife.

1253
01:09:56,821 --> 01:09:59,451
And after all the outrage,
when I'm ready...

1254
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:01,490
I'll go out on the water
with a handful of pills...

1255
01:10:01,492 --> 01:10:04,042
And a pocket full of stones.

1256
01:10:04,078 --> 01:10:06,868
And when they find my body,
they'll know...

1257
01:10:06,914 --> 01:10:10,214
Nick dunne dumped his beloved
like garbage.

1258
01:10:10,251 --> 01:10:12,591
And she floated down
past all the other...

1259
01:10:12,628 --> 01:10:15,958
Abused, unwanted, inconvenient women.

1260
01:10:17,341 --> 01:10:19,301
Then, Nick will die, too.

1261
01:10:20,178 --> 01:10:22,048
Nick and Amy will be gone.

1262
01:10:22,096 --> 01:10:24,216
But, then, we never really existed.

1263
01:10:24,265 --> 01:10:27,485
Nick loved a girl
I was pretending to be.

1264
01:10:27,518 --> 01:10:28,268
"Cool girl."

1265
01:10:28,978 --> 01:10:32,818
Men always use that
as their defining compliment.

1266
01:10:32,857 --> 01:10:33,817
"She's a cool girl."

1267
01:10:34,984 --> 01:10:36,114
Cool girl is hot.

1268
01:10:36,152 --> 01:10:37,572
Cool girl is game.

1269
01:10:37,612 --> 01:10:38,532
Cool girl is fun.

1270
01:10:38,946 --> 01:10:41,446
Cool girl never gets angry at her man.

1271
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:44,120
She only smiles in a chagrined,
loving manner...

1272
01:10:44,785 --> 01:10:47,745
And then presents her mouth for fucking.

1273
01:10:47,788 --> 01:10:49,788
She likes what he likes.

1274
01:10:49,832 --> 01:10:53,292
So evidently, he's a vinyl hipster
who loves fetish manga.

1275
01:10:54,337 --> 01:10:57,627
If he likes girls gone wild,
she's a mall babe...

1276
01:10:57,673 --> 01:11:01,473
Who talks football
and endures buffalo wings at Hooters.

1277
01:11:01,511 --> 01:11:05,101
When I met Nick dunne,
I knew he wanted cool girl.

1278
01:11:05,139 --> 01:11:07,809
And for him, I'll admit,
I was willing to try.

1279
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:09,850
I wax-stripped my pussy raw.

1280
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:13,650
I drank canned beer
watching Adam sandier movies.

1281
01:11:13,898 --> 01:11:16,688
I ate cold pizza
and remained a size two.

1282
01:11:16,734 --> 01:11:18,694
I blew him semi-regularly.

1283
01:11:20,029 --> 01:11:21,359
I lived in the moment.

1284
01:11:21,656 --> 01:11:24,196
I was fucking game.

1285
01:11:24,825 --> 01:11:26,865
I can't say I didn't enjoy some of it.

1286
01:11:27,703 --> 01:11:31,003
Nick teased out of me
things I didn't know existed.

1287
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:34,340
A lightness, a humor, an ease.

1288
01:11:34,377 --> 01:11:37,297
But I made him smarter. Sharper.

1289
01:11:37,338 --> 01:11:40,968
I inspired him to rise to my level.

1290
01:11:41,008 --> 01:11:44,758
I forged the man of my dreams.

1291
01:11:47,098 --> 01:11:50,018
We were happy pretending
to be other people.

1292
01:11:50,059 --> 01:11:51,889
We were the happiest couple we knew.

1293
01:11:53,521 --> 01:11:56,521
And what's the point of being together
if you're not the happiest?

1294
01:11:57,191 --> 01:11:59,401
But Nick got lazy.

1295
01:11:59,443 --> 01:12:01,653
He became someone
I did not agree to marry.

1296
01:12:01,696 --> 01:12:04,866
He actually expected me
to love him unconditionally.

1297
01:12:05,533 --> 01:12:10,043
Then he dragged me, penniless,
to the navel of this great country...

1298
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:14,039
And found himself a newer,
younger, bouncier...

1299
01:12:14,083 --> 01:12:15,083
Cool girl.

1300
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:21,590
You think I'd let him destroy me
and end up happier than ever?

1301
01:12:22,091 --> 01:12:23,761
No fucking way.

1302
01:12:24,135 --> 01:12:25,935
He doesn't get to win.

1303
01:12:36,272 --> 01:12:40,232
My cute, charming, salt-of-the-earth,
Missouri guy.

1304
01:12:42,653 --> 01:12:45,113
He needed to learn.

1305
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:48,453
Grown-ups work for things.

1306
01:12:48,993 --> 01:12:50,953
Grown-ups pay.

1307
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:54,920
Grown-ups suffer consequences.

1308
01:12:58,419 --> 01:12:59,629
Wait.

1309
01:13:00,004 --> 01:13:02,804
I need 20 seconds where you
don't judge me, interrupt me...

1310
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,470
Or get angry.

1311
01:13:05,927 --> 01:13:07,467
Okay.

1312
01:13:11,432 --> 01:13:13,392
Is that all the stuff
from the credit cards?

1313
01:13:13,434 --> 01:13:16,604
Where do you store goodies
for anniversary five?

1314
01:13:16,646 --> 01:13:17,436
Wood.

1315
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:20,610
- Woodshed.
- Yeah, my woodshed.

1316
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:23,150
That fucking bitch.

1317
01:13:24,987 --> 01:13:26,317
- I thought...
- It's all right.

1318
01:13:26,364 --> 01:13:27,824
I would have, too.

1319
01:13:31,285 --> 01:13:32,485
What's that present?

1320
01:13:32,537 --> 01:13:34,287
I don't know.

1321
01:13:34,330 --> 01:13:36,290
Let's find out.

1322
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,800
"Dear husband, I know you think
you're moving through this world unseen.

1323
01:13:46,843 --> 01:13:48,263
"Don't believe that for a second.

1324
01:13:48,302 --> 01:13:50,583
"I know where you've been,
and I know where you're going."

1325
01:13:53,808 --> 01:13:55,848
"For this anniversary,
I've arranged a trip.

1326
01:13:55,893 --> 01:13:57,773
"Follow the river, up, up, up.

1327
01:13:57,812 --> 01:14:00,522
"Sit back and relax,
because you are done."

1328
01:14:00,565 --> 01:14:01,985
What's "up, up river"?

1329
01:14:02,024 --> 01:14:04,194
"Up the river." Prison.

1330
01:14:04,235 --> 01:14:06,155
Fucking crazy bitch.

1331
01:14:06,195 --> 01:14:07,815
That's what this is.

1332
01:14:07,864 --> 01:14:10,164
She's framing me for her murder.

1333
01:14:10,199 --> 01:14:11,489
You married a complete psychopath.

1334
01:14:11,534 --> 01:14:13,664
The morning of our anniversary...

1335
01:14:13,703 --> 01:14:18,003
I was gonna ask her for a divorce.
I just couldn't do it.

1336
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,500
I couldn't fake it for another year,
another day.

1337
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,463
Then what happened?

1338
01:14:21,502 --> 01:14:22,802
Before I could say anything, she said...

1339
01:14:22,837 --> 01:14:26,217
"I need you to go somewhere
and really think about our marriage."

1340
01:14:26,257 --> 01:14:27,507
She knew I would go to Sawyer beach.

1341
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:28,840
So you'd have no alibi.

1342
01:14:28,885 --> 01:14:31,105
She stage-managed me.

1343
01:14:31,387 --> 01:14:35,057
She knew exactly what I would do.
And I fucking did it.

1344
01:14:35,099 --> 01:14:36,639
I went to the beach,
I thought about our marriage.

1345
01:14:36,684 --> 01:14:38,394
I came back
and decided I wanted a divorce.

1346
01:14:38,436 --> 01:14:39,676
And by the time you got home...

1347
01:14:39,687 --> 01:14:41,227
she was gone.

1348
01:14:41,856 --> 01:14:42,726
You fuck!

1349
01:14:42,773 --> 01:14:44,363
She's good.

1350
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:47,359
Part of me was relieved...

1351
01:14:47,403 --> 01:14:49,703
When I thought she was gone.

1352
01:14:54,076 --> 01:14:55,786
Punch and Judy puppets.

1353
01:14:58,789 --> 01:15:01,879
Remember, he beats Judy to death
and kills that baby.

1354
01:15:01,918 --> 01:15:03,038
So I'm punch.

1355
01:15:04,045 --> 01:15:06,055
We already knew that, Amy,
what's your point?

1356
01:15:07,215 --> 01:15:10,055
Does Missouri have the death penalty?

1357
01:15:36,953 --> 01:15:38,373
Hey, neighbor.

1358
01:15:39,288 --> 01:15:41,668
It's been weeks
since I had anyone decent next door.

1359
01:15:42,291 --> 01:15:44,921
Well, I don't know how decent I feel.

1360
01:15:44,961 --> 01:15:48,091
As long as you don't own a python
and blast death metal at 4 am...

1361
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:50,130
We're gonna be best friends.

1362
01:15:50,174 --> 01:15:52,264
All right. Nice meeting you.

1363
01:15:52,301 --> 01:15:53,891
I'm greta.

1364
01:15:54,512 --> 01:15:55,802
I'm Nancy.

1365
01:15:55,847 --> 01:15:57,807
Are you going to the marina?
I could use some creamer.

1366
01:15:57,849 --> 01:15:59,269
I'm sorry. I can't.

1367
01:15:59,308 --> 01:16:00,518
I've got work to do.

1368
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:02,850
All right. See you around!

1369
01:16:03,145 --> 01:16:05,055
You will.

1370
01:16:51,027 --> 01:16:56,237
Come on.
Show me that darling Nicky smile.

1371
01:16:58,034 --> 01:16:59,914
You asshole.

1372
01:17:15,384 --> 01:17:16,894
Hey.

1373
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,430
Nancy.

1374
01:17:23,726 --> 01:17:25,556
Nancy.

1375
01:17:26,562 --> 01:17:28,772
It's hot again today.

1376
01:17:31,067 --> 01:17:32,897
So, where are you from?

1377
01:17:33,402 --> 01:17:34,572
Let me guess.

1378
01:17:37,698 --> 01:17:38,528
Nebraska.

1379
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:42,120
New Orleans.

1380
01:17:45,581 --> 01:17:48,081
You know, I am an expert oiler.

1381
01:17:48,125 --> 01:17:49,915
Oh, I just bet you are.

1382
01:17:49,961 --> 01:17:52,591
Lotions and balms. Ointment.

1383
01:17:53,297 --> 01:17:55,217
I would hate
for y'all to get tan lines.

1384
01:17:55,258 --> 01:17:57,258
So sweet.

1385
01:17:58,094 --> 01:18:00,764
Okay. You know where I'll be.

1386
01:18:03,641 --> 01:18:06,061
I see we have the same taste in men.

1387
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:10,020
I clipped it on a bathroom cabinet.

1388
01:18:10,064 --> 01:18:13,114
Least you could do
is not keep his secrets for him.

1389
01:18:14,151 --> 01:18:15,531
Let me guess.

1390
01:18:15,570 --> 01:18:19,450
He's trying to watch the big game
and you just won't shut up.

1391
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:22,580
No, you don't seem
like much of a talker.

1392
01:18:22,618 --> 01:18:23,578
I got it.

1393
01:18:23,619 --> 01:18:26,079
You caught your boy rubbing up
on some hot little skank...

1394
01:18:26,122 --> 01:18:28,122
And he apologized to you
by busting you a good one.

1395
01:18:30,501 --> 01:18:31,291
Worse.

1396
01:18:31,627 --> 01:18:32,627
Worse?

1397
01:18:33,462 --> 01:18:37,172
I went to the bar where he works
to surprise him.

1398
01:18:37,216 --> 01:18:41,926
And out he comes with this girl
who had no business being in a bar.

1399
01:18:44,891 --> 01:18:46,891
On the very first night that we met...

1400
01:18:47,143 --> 01:18:51,313
We walked by a bakery
that was having their sugar delivered.

1401
01:18:52,148 --> 01:18:54,528
And it was in the air, everywhere.

1402
01:18:54,567 --> 01:18:56,857
A sugar storm.

1403
01:18:56,903 --> 01:18:59,033
And before he kissed me...

1404
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:01,161
He leaned in...

1405
01:19:02,658 --> 01:19:04,948
And did this.

1406
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:18,090
- And guess what.
- What?

1407
01:19:18,132 --> 01:19:19,842
He did the exact same thing with her.

1408
01:19:24,096 --> 01:19:27,096
That is the most disgusting thing
I ever heard.

1409
01:19:27,141 --> 01:19:28,851
Thank you.

1410
01:19:43,616 --> 01:19:45,196
Thanks very much.

1411
01:19:51,999 --> 01:19:54,289
Well, we've gone mainstream.

1412
01:20:09,892 --> 01:20:13,022
It's an appeals process,
so we will attempt to appeal to them.

1413
01:20:13,062 --> 01:20:15,192
Mr. bolt. Tanner bolt?

1414
01:20:17,066 --> 01:20:18,476
Nick dunne.

1415
01:20:18,526 --> 01:20:20,816
I have been sitting by the phone,
my friend.

1416
01:20:24,282 --> 01:20:25,532
I'm sorry.

1417
01:20:25,575 --> 01:20:27,415
Do you not believe me?

1418
01:20:27,451 --> 01:20:30,701
No, I believe you. It's just the
craziest thing I've ever heard.

1419
01:20:30,746 --> 01:20:34,076
I love it. But, for you, it sucks.

1420
01:20:34,792 --> 01:20:38,092
But you gotta have a grudging respect
for your wife at this point, right?

1421
01:20:38,129 --> 01:20:39,709
- Are you laughing me out of the building?
- No!

1422
01:20:39,755 --> 01:20:41,505
Are you kidding me? I'm in.

1423
01:20:41,549 --> 01:20:43,009
I'm way in.

1424
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:45,680
You came to the right guy.
This is what I do, Nick.

1425
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:49,140
This is why I have a $100,000 retainer.
I win the unwinnable cases.

1426
01:20:49,182 --> 01:20:50,852
$100,000?

1427
01:20:50,892 --> 01:20:52,432
We'll figure something out.

1428
01:20:52,476 --> 01:20:53,516
I'll give you a special...

1429
01:20:53,519 --> 01:20:56,439
"My wife is skilled
in the art of vengeance" rate.

1430
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,520
Okay.

1431
01:20:57,565 --> 01:20:59,195
So, what's the plan?

1432
01:20:59,233 --> 01:21:01,113
Well, right now,
it's a "he said, she said."

1433
01:21:01,152 --> 01:21:03,612
- She's telling a better story.
- No, Nick.

1434
01:21:03,654 --> 01:21:05,494
She is telling the perfect story.

1435
01:21:05,781 --> 01:21:09,081
So, we need to start today
to prepare your defense, should we need it.

1436
01:21:09,118 --> 01:21:11,518
- And if we decide to go with
your version of... - the truth.

1437
01:21:12,413 --> 01:21:15,753
Then we'll need to realign
the public's perception of Amy.

1438
01:21:15,791 --> 01:21:18,041
Make them stop seeing her
as America's sweetheart...

1439
01:21:18,085 --> 01:21:21,415
And see her for what she is,
which a mind-fucker of the first degree.

1440
01:21:21,839 --> 01:21:25,799
Now, that is a huge realignment.
We'll need other voices besides yours.

1441
01:21:25,843 --> 01:21:28,103
There has to be someone out there
that she's screwed with in the past.

1442
01:21:28,137 --> 01:21:31,217
There's a New York guy.
O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara.

1443
01:21:31,265 --> 01:21:33,635
Eight years ago,
she pressed charges against him.

1444
01:21:33,684 --> 01:21:35,854
That should be easy to find.

1445
01:21:36,395 --> 01:21:39,765
Ex-classmate, desi collings.

1446
01:21:39,815 --> 01:21:41,695
She said that he stalked her.
He's in St. Louis.

1447
01:21:42,985 --> 01:21:45,235
You go talk to Tommy,
and I'll draw up the contract.

1448
01:21:49,534 --> 01:21:52,544
I told you, you came to the right guy.

1449
01:21:54,747 --> 01:21:55,957
Apparently.

1450
01:22:05,007 --> 01:22:06,797
Tommy?

1451
01:22:06,843 --> 01:22:08,393
Yeah.

1452
01:22:08,803 --> 01:22:10,763
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1453
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:15,560
You're gonna want a drink.

1454
01:22:16,102 --> 01:22:17,442
Yeah.

1455
01:22:17,478 --> 01:22:20,268
So, she said you got physical with her.

1456
01:22:20,314 --> 01:22:23,284
No, dude, she said I raped her.

1457
01:22:23,317 --> 01:22:25,687
First degree, felony rape.

1458
01:22:26,445 --> 01:22:28,155
- Did you do it?
- Did you do it?

1459
01:22:29,323 --> 01:22:31,413
I was looking at 30 years to life.

1460
01:22:31,951 --> 01:22:33,491
- Did you get a trial?
- Fuck, no.

1461
01:22:33,536 --> 01:22:35,746
Do I look like
I would do well in the yard?

1462
01:22:35,788 --> 01:22:38,708
I pled down, man.
Sexual assault one, no jail time.

1463
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:40,795
- That's something.
- Oh, yeah.

1464
01:22:40,835 --> 01:22:42,255
I've been unemployed
for the last eight years...

1465
01:22:42,295 --> 01:22:44,805
Because I have to write "sexual offender"
on every job application.

1466
01:22:44,839 --> 01:22:47,799
I'm on a neighborhood watch list,
because I have to register as a predator.

1467
01:22:47,842 --> 01:22:51,182
I haven't had a date in almost a decade,
because if a girl googles me...

1468
01:22:53,139 --> 01:22:55,059
Could you walk me through what happened?

1469
01:22:55,349 --> 01:22:58,479
I meet Amy at this party, you know?

1470
01:22:58,519 --> 01:23:00,149
We click. She's perfect.

1471
01:23:00,188 --> 01:23:02,518
She's beautiful,
she's smart, she's well-read...

1472
01:23:02,565 --> 01:23:04,865
She's got an ass
like a 20-year-old stripper.

1473
01:23:04,901 --> 01:23:06,691
I think, "what's the catch?"

1474
01:23:06,736 --> 01:23:09,906
A few months, it hits me.
This is not going to be easy.

1475
01:23:10,573 --> 01:23:13,623
Girls like a fixer-upper, but Amy?

1476
01:23:13,659 --> 01:23:17,119
She annexed me.
She made me her business.

1477
01:23:17,163 --> 01:23:20,963
It was just too much.
She went out and bought me ties.

1478
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,210
And we must have gone
20 rounds over that.

1479
01:23:23,252 --> 01:23:26,012
Ties. The whole thing just became...

1480
01:23:26,047 --> 01:23:29,837
- so, you broke up with her.
- No, I just backed away.

1481
01:23:29,884 --> 01:23:32,684
Gave her some space. No big deal, right?

1482
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,390
So I thought.

1483
01:23:34,430 --> 01:23:36,720
Then one night,
Amy comes over to my place...

1484
01:23:36,766 --> 01:23:39,686
With a bottle of bourbon
and a bootleg of this band I love.

1485
01:23:39,727 --> 01:23:42,727
And within two minutes,
she's got my pants around my ankles...

1486
01:23:42,772 --> 01:23:44,362
And she is kneeling down, and...

1487
01:23:44,398 --> 01:23:46,398
I'm sorry. I know it's your wife.

1488
01:23:46,442 --> 01:23:48,322
- You had sex?
- Yeah, consensual.

1489
01:23:48,361 --> 01:23:50,451
It was rough,
but she was screaming for it.

1490
01:23:50,905 --> 01:23:53,245
Next morning,
there's two cops at my door.

1491
01:23:53,574 --> 01:23:56,494
Amy has wounds
that are consistent with rape.

1492
01:23:56,536 --> 01:23:59,706
Ligature marks on her wrist,
and my semen.

1493
01:23:59,747 --> 01:24:03,417
It looks like I've tied Amy to my bed,
and raped her.

1494
01:24:03,459 --> 01:24:04,919
Me!

1495
01:24:04,961 --> 01:24:06,711
And then, guess what they find.

1496
01:24:06,754 --> 01:24:08,804
Headboards of my bed, one on each side.

1497
01:24:09,215 --> 01:24:10,555
The ties you wouldn't wear.

1498
01:24:10,591 --> 01:24:11,931
You do know your wife.

1499
01:24:12,593 --> 01:24:14,433
- Did you ever see her again?
- Yeah.

1500
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:15,890
On TV, last week, with you.

1501
01:24:16,472 --> 01:24:17,892
I thought, "there's Amy.

1502
01:24:17,932 --> 01:24:21,942
"She's graduated from being raped
to being murdered."

1503
01:24:25,773 --> 01:24:26,943
You been watching this, too?

1504
01:24:26,983 --> 01:24:28,193
Last night's bombshell.

1505
01:24:28,234 --> 01:24:29,284
We just found out...

1506
01:24:29,318 --> 01:24:32,148
Amy elliott dunne was, indeed,
pregnant when she went missing.

1507
01:24:32,655 --> 01:24:35,625
Kelly capitono,
this makes me wanna throw up.

1508
01:24:35,658 --> 01:24:38,618
What is it about a pregnant woman,
a woman carrying life inside her...

1509
01:24:38,661 --> 01:24:40,121
That turns men into animals?

1510
01:24:40,162 --> 01:24:41,662
Ellen, this is an epidemic.

1511
01:24:41,956 --> 01:24:44,206
The third leading cause of death
among pregnant women...

1512
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:46,630
Is homicide committed by
a boyfriend or husband.

1513
01:24:46,669 --> 01:24:49,549
Let's not forget about the wife, ever.

1514
01:24:49,589 --> 01:24:53,629
Tonight, we welcome Amy's best friend,
noelle hawthorne.

1515
01:24:53,676 --> 01:24:56,046
Thanks for being on the show, noelle.

1516
01:24:56,095 --> 01:24:57,385
Thank you, Ellen.

1517
01:24:57,430 --> 01:24:58,930
And let me just say this...

1518
01:24:58,973 --> 01:25:02,563
Amy would have loved you,
and all you do for women.

1519
01:25:02,602 --> 01:25:03,642
Oh, that's nice.

1520
01:25:03,686 --> 01:25:05,806
Why don't you tell us
about your friend, noelle?

1521
01:25:05,855 --> 01:25:08,405
Amy was so nurturing.

1522
01:25:08,441 --> 01:25:10,821
Oh, I'd love if just once,
someone was like...

1523
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:12,150
"She was a real rag."

1524
01:25:14,655 --> 01:25:17,235
She was beautiful and smart and kind.

1525
01:25:17,283 --> 01:25:19,333
Seems like a rich bitch to me.

1526
01:25:19,368 --> 01:25:21,998
What do you mean? People love her.

1527
01:25:22,038 --> 01:25:24,458
I don't know. She seems uppity.

1528
01:25:26,167 --> 01:25:28,667
Spoiled rich girl,
married a cheating asshole.

1529
01:25:28,711 --> 01:25:29,921
Paid the ultimate price.

1530
01:25:29,962 --> 01:25:33,422
The only secret was her husband.
We never met Nick.

1531
01:25:33,466 --> 01:25:35,086
He never introduced himself.

1532
01:25:35,134 --> 01:25:37,514
Why was that, noelle? Why do you think?

1533
01:25:37,553 --> 01:25:38,553
I think we know why.

1534
01:25:39,347 --> 01:25:41,597
Because he had a violent temper.

1535
01:25:41,641 --> 01:25:42,681
A little harsh.

1536
01:25:42,725 --> 01:25:44,305
That's life, baby.

1537
01:25:44,352 --> 01:25:45,913
He knew I'd have
seen right through him.

1538
01:25:46,854 --> 01:25:48,194
Don't get me wrong.

1539
01:25:48,231 --> 01:25:50,111
I'm not saying it's okay he killed her.

1540
01:25:50,149 --> 01:25:53,569
I'm just saying, there are consequences.

1541
01:25:55,696 --> 01:25:56,696
Fuck, yeah.

1542
01:25:56,739 --> 01:25:59,159
She was so alone.

1543
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,120
And she was so innocent.

1544
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:04,620
You're a good friend, noelle.
And you're a good friend of the show.

1545
01:26:04,664 --> 01:26:05,874
Thanks for coming on.

1546
01:26:05,915 --> 01:26:07,375
Please tell me you landed Tanner bolt.

1547
01:26:07,416 --> 01:26:09,706
Tanner bolt landed me.

1548
01:26:09,752 --> 01:26:13,052
I'm gonna try and see desi collings
on my way home.

1549
01:26:13,089 --> 01:26:15,049
And, go...

1550
01:26:15,091 --> 01:26:18,261
Tanner's retainer is $100,000.

1551
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:20,179
That's just the retainer.

1552
01:26:20,555 --> 01:26:24,185
Listen, I've got $47,000 in savings.
I've got $2,500 in an ira.

1553
01:26:24,225 --> 01:26:26,328
I'm approved for a second
mortgage on the house.

1554
01:26:26,354 --> 01:26:27,315
We will go from there.

1555
01:26:27,353 --> 01:26:29,103
Thank you.

1556
01:26:29,856 --> 01:26:31,516
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1557
01:26:31,566 --> 01:26:34,316
Nick keeps his father,
who has Alzheimer's, in a facility.

1558
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:36,570
Number of times he visited last year?
One.

1559
01:26:36,612 --> 01:26:37,572
Oh, fuck!

1560
01:26:37,613 --> 01:26:40,323
His twin sister, margo,
well, she is a peach.

1561
01:26:40,366 --> 01:26:42,696
These two spend their days
in the bar Amy bought them.

1562
01:26:43,286 --> 01:26:45,406
Playing what, Lauren? Playing house?

1563
01:26:45,454 --> 01:26:46,584
What the fuck?

1564
01:26:46,622 --> 01:26:49,292
Twin siblings often enable and abet.

1565
01:26:49,792 --> 01:26:51,632
While I never examined Nick,
or his sister...

1566
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:54,550
They both seem very, very close.

1567
01:26:54,881 --> 01:26:56,131
It's twin-cest.

1568
01:26:56,465 --> 01:26:59,175
Disturbingly close, Lauren.

1569
01:26:59,218 --> 01:27:01,218
And so, we close with a question.

1570
01:27:01,262 --> 01:27:02,762
What kind of moral rot...

1571
01:27:02,805 --> 01:27:07,515
Allows a beautiful, talented,
kind, smart, loving mother...

1572
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:11,270
To vanish without
the heavens hearing our outraged cries?

1573
01:27:11,314 --> 01:27:12,364
Can I bum a cigarette?

1574
01:27:12,398 --> 01:27:16,148
Amy elliott dunne, we care about you,
and we will not forget.

1575
01:27:16,652 --> 01:27:18,862
And you know what else we won't forget?

1576
01:27:18,905 --> 01:27:21,285
Missouri has the death penalty.

1577
01:27:21,324 --> 01:27:22,494
Amen.

1578
01:27:48,351 --> 01:27:50,641
I'd like to report
some strange activity...

1579
01:27:50,686 --> 01:27:54,186
Near the woodshed
on the property of one margo dunne.

1580
01:28:35,398 --> 01:28:36,858
Hey.

1581
01:28:42,405 --> 01:28:44,535
- Mr. dunne.
- Mr. collings.

1582
01:28:45,533 --> 01:28:48,623
I know you.
I saw you at the volunteer center.

1583
01:28:48,661 --> 01:28:50,371
I wanted to help.

1584
01:28:51,163 --> 01:28:52,873
I hope you don't mind me coming by.

1585
01:28:52,915 --> 01:28:55,995
I got your address from this letter
that you wrote my wife.

1586
01:28:56,878 --> 01:29:00,378
Amy and I believe
in the lost art of letter-writing.

1587
01:29:00,423 --> 01:29:04,263
I always wondered
why you kept in touch after...

1588
01:29:04,927 --> 01:29:06,217
Everything.

1589
01:29:06,262 --> 01:29:08,682
You were together for two years
in boarding school, right?

1590
01:29:08,723 --> 01:29:10,893
She was my first serious girlfriend.

1591
01:29:10,933 --> 01:29:13,733
- Why did you break up?
- That's a strange question.

1592
01:29:13,769 --> 01:29:15,729
Did you treat her bad?
Did you cheat on her?

1593
01:29:15,771 --> 01:29:16,981
That's a rude question.

1594
01:29:17,023 --> 01:29:18,733
Let me tell you what Amy told me.

1595
01:29:18,774 --> 01:29:21,744
She dumped you,
you completely unraveled.

1596
01:29:21,777 --> 01:29:23,857
You stalked her, you threatened her...

1597
01:29:23,905 --> 01:29:27,415
And you attempted suicide in her bed
and were institutionalized.

1598
01:29:27,450 --> 01:29:31,370
Your wife is missing,
and you came all this way to tell me this?

1599
01:29:31,412 --> 01:29:33,622
I thought there might be
another side to this story.

1600
01:29:37,293 --> 01:29:39,133
Mr. collings.

1601
01:29:41,214 --> 01:29:43,134
Fuck.

1602
01:29:48,763 --> 01:29:51,773
The missing persons case
of Amy elliott dunne.

1603
01:29:51,807 --> 01:29:55,477
She is the beautiful blonde inspiration
for the amazing Amy kids' book series.

1604
01:30:12,662 --> 01:30:14,872
You're reading that diary again?

1605
01:30:14,914 --> 01:30:15,964
You know how it ends.

1606
01:30:15,998 --> 01:30:18,458
It interests me.

1607
01:30:18,501 --> 01:30:20,091
Hey, Rhonda.

1608
01:30:20,127 --> 01:30:22,047
"He's gonna kill me." The end.

1609
01:30:22,088 --> 01:30:24,208
Why did he go to his dad's house
to burn it?

1610
01:30:24,257 --> 01:30:25,377
It's private. There's no one there.

1611
01:30:25,424 --> 01:30:28,224
Why didn't he make sure
it actually burned?

1612
01:30:28,261 --> 01:30:31,221
Because he tripped the alarm.
You were up his ass with a flashlight.

1613
01:30:31,264 --> 01:30:33,604
The whole thing just feels hinky.

1614
01:30:33,641 --> 01:30:35,731
Like finding an envelope marked "clue."

1615
01:30:35,768 --> 01:30:36,888
You ever hear the expression...

1616
01:30:36,936 --> 01:30:38,777
"The simplest answer
is often the correct one"?

1617
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:41,480
Actually, I've never
found that to be true.

1618
01:30:41,524 --> 01:30:43,324
- Good night.
- Good night.

1619
01:30:45,987 --> 01:30:46,987
Hey.

1620
01:30:56,455 --> 01:30:58,325
Elvis is in Missouri.

1621
01:30:58,374 --> 01:31:00,504
Thank God. Come on in.

1622
01:31:00,543 --> 01:31:03,423
First thing you have to understand
about Amy, she loves to teach lessons.

1623
01:31:03,546 --> 01:31:06,006
- Play God.
- Yeah, old testament God.

1624
01:31:06,048 --> 01:31:07,088
Okay. Keep talking.

1625
01:31:07,133 --> 01:31:08,843
She finds out I've been cheating on her
with Andie...

1626
01:31:08,885 --> 01:31:10,475
Decides to teach me a lesson.

1627
01:31:10,511 --> 01:31:12,431
Fakes her own death, frames me for it.

1628
01:31:12,471 --> 01:31:14,681
Blood in the house, credit cards,
life insurance.

1629
01:31:14,724 --> 01:31:15,934
She does the treasure hunt.

1630
01:31:15,975 --> 01:31:17,315
Now, the treasure hunt is critical.

1631
01:31:17,351 --> 01:31:19,798
She's taking us on a
tour of my infidelities.

1632
01:31:19,824 --> 01:31:21,021
Rubbing my nose in it.

1633
01:31:21,063 --> 01:31:23,113
And she leaves clue number one
for the police...

1634
01:31:23,149 --> 01:31:24,859
Which will lead them
back to my office...

1635
01:31:24,901 --> 01:31:27,441
Which is a place
where Andie and I would often...

1636
01:31:27,486 --> 01:31:28,816
And she leaves a pair of red panties.

1637
01:31:28,863 --> 01:31:30,033
Right. Racy, looks bad.

1638
01:31:30,072 --> 01:31:31,782
- Clue two.
- My father's house.

1639
01:31:31,824 --> 01:31:34,204
Another place where Andie and I
would occasionally have relations.

1640
01:31:34,243 --> 01:31:35,623
- Clue three?
- Woodshed.

1641
01:31:35,661 --> 01:31:37,161
- Also a location...
- Oh, my God.

1642
01:31:37,205 --> 01:31:38,965
- We had limited options.
- A hotel.

1643
01:31:38,998 --> 01:31:41,498
- Amy would have seen the credit card bill.
- Put it on Andie's credit card.

1644
01:31:41,542 --> 01:31:42,882
Andie's statement
went right to her parents.

1645
01:31:42,919 --> 01:31:45,459
Nick, margo, can we head over
to the little brown house?

1646
01:31:45,505 --> 01:31:47,305
- This leads us to what?
- My dad's house.

1647
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:49,090
Dad's house is blue.

1648
01:31:50,384 --> 01:31:53,434
After the divorce,
when dad wasn't coming around...

1649
01:31:53,763 --> 01:31:58,023
I used to pretend that he was a spy
named Mr. brown, who...

1650
01:31:58,059 --> 01:32:01,729
For the sake of his children's safety,
had to deny their existence.

1651
01:32:01,771 --> 01:32:03,191
You never told me that.

1652
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:05,229
You told her that?

1653
01:32:05,274 --> 01:32:07,574
We've got incriminating red panties
in your office.

1654
01:32:07,902 --> 01:32:10,302
We've got a showcase showdown
worth of crap in your woodshed.

1655
01:32:11,405 --> 01:32:14,735
So, what in God's name
is at your father's house, Nick?

1656
01:32:14,784 --> 01:32:15,874
And be honest.

1657
01:32:15,910 --> 01:32:17,750
I honestly have no idea.

1658
01:32:24,919 --> 01:32:28,629
Whatever they found, I think it's
safe to assume that it's very bad.

1659
01:32:30,466 --> 01:32:32,716
We got a lot of uncontained issues here.

1660
01:32:32,969 --> 01:32:36,059
Nick, do you have any idea
as to what Andie's mindset is?

1661
01:32:37,265 --> 01:32:39,065
We haven't communicated since the vigil.

1662
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:40,430
Okay. Amy's parents?

1663
01:32:40,476 --> 01:32:42,056
- No, it's...
- More pressure.

1664
01:32:42,103 --> 01:32:45,363
We got a hurt, young girlfriend who will
no doubt go public at any moment.

1665
01:32:45,398 --> 01:32:46,898
- No, Andie won't do that.
- She will.

1666
01:32:46,941 --> 01:32:48,651
They always do.
Don't take it personally.

1667
01:32:49,151 --> 01:32:51,321
Amy's got us in an interesting bind.

1668
01:32:51,654 --> 01:32:53,954
- We need to tell the cops about Andie.
- Really?

1669
01:32:53,990 --> 01:32:56,160
Right now,
Andie just gives you another motive.

1670
01:32:56,993 --> 01:32:58,163
We need to tell the cops
about the woodshed.

1671
01:32:58,452 --> 01:32:59,872
We need to be on the front end of that.

1672
01:32:59,912 --> 01:33:02,252
But I'm gonna warn you
as to what will happen.

1673
01:33:02,832 --> 01:33:04,042
They'll go after margo.

1674
01:33:04,083 --> 01:33:05,083
They can't do that, can they?

1675
01:33:05,126 --> 01:33:07,036
She's your accomplice.
She helped you hide the evidence.

1676
01:33:07,086 --> 01:33:09,166
In all likelihood,
she knows that you killed Amy.

1677
01:33:10,089 --> 01:33:11,509
God.

1678
01:33:11,841 --> 01:33:13,931
Well, what are we going to do?

1679
01:33:13,968 --> 01:33:14,838
We find Amy.

1680
01:33:15,261 --> 01:33:17,601
No. Any other strategy
is missing the point.

1681
01:33:17,638 --> 01:33:19,968
I've got two ex-secret service guys
that are really good.

1682
01:33:20,016 --> 01:33:21,636
I'll put them on it.

1683
01:33:21,684 --> 01:33:23,104
But where do they start, Nick?

1684
01:33:23,477 --> 01:33:24,597
Where would Amy go?

1685
01:33:26,772 --> 01:33:28,402
I have no idea.

1686
01:33:32,862 --> 01:33:35,492
Are we keeping score?

1687
01:33:36,157 --> 01:33:37,527
Hey!

1688
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:42,330
I thought we were steering clear
of men for a while.

1689
01:33:42,371 --> 01:33:43,331
He's nice.

1690
01:33:43,372 --> 01:33:45,872
Because he wants to fuck you.

1691
01:33:47,502 --> 01:33:49,042
She's still moping about her ex?

1692
01:33:50,838 --> 01:33:53,508
He got cheated on, too.

1693
01:33:56,886 --> 01:33:59,756
We three are the
saddest sacks in all the ozarks.

1694
01:33:59,805 --> 01:34:01,345
I'm not sad.

1695
01:34:01,891 --> 01:34:02,851
I'm angry.

1696
01:34:02,892 --> 01:34:04,692
There you go.

1697
01:34:04,727 --> 01:34:07,347
I almost drank myself to death
when my wife left me.

1698
01:34:07,396 --> 01:34:09,646
I was gonna kill myself.
Can you believe that?

1699
01:34:09,690 --> 01:34:10,820
Don't give him the pleasure.

1700
01:34:10,858 --> 01:34:13,988
I was going to drown myself
in the Gulf of Mexico...

1701
01:34:14,028 --> 01:34:16,528
Let myself be dinner
for the great whites.

1702
01:34:16,572 --> 01:34:18,372
Gulf is bull sharks, miss nawlins.

1703
01:34:18,407 --> 01:34:22,327
Why should I die? I'm not the asshole.

1704
01:34:22,370 --> 01:34:24,830
Please put that on a t-shirt.

1705
01:34:33,381 --> 01:34:35,761
Miss moneybags.
I thought you said you were broke.

1706
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:38,550
That's a fat wad.

1707
01:34:40,346 --> 01:34:42,136
It's mostly singles.

1708
01:34:42,181 --> 01:34:44,061
Singles? What are you, a stripper?

1709
01:34:44,851 --> 01:34:47,441
Swamp girls, or treasure chest?

1710
01:34:48,563 --> 01:34:49,613
We're just teasing.

1711
01:34:50,398 --> 01:34:52,188
Don't they tease people down in nola?

1712
01:34:54,610 --> 01:34:57,570
We can expect Nick dunne's arrest
any day now.

1713
01:34:57,613 --> 01:35:01,333
We've got blood in the house,
huge debt, an unwanted pregnancy.

1714
01:35:01,367 --> 01:35:05,327
And we have Amy elliott dunne,
missing for five days...

1715
01:35:05,371 --> 01:35:07,501
Crying out for justice.

1716
01:35:08,291 --> 01:35:10,001
We'll be right back.

1717
01:36:02,261 --> 01:36:04,851
Tanner has a very bad idea
he's going to pitch you.

1718
01:36:04,889 --> 01:36:05,679
Yeah?

1719
01:36:05,723 --> 01:36:07,313
You're doing Sharon schieber
tomorrow in St. Louis.

1720
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:08,350
It could go so wrong.

1721
01:36:08,392 --> 01:36:10,142
And you are going
to tell her about Andie.

1722
01:36:10,186 --> 01:36:11,476
Nope.

1723
01:36:11,521 --> 01:36:13,521
That sounds like a very bad idea.

1724
01:36:13,564 --> 01:36:15,654
You haven't heard from her
in three days.

1725
01:36:15,691 --> 01:36:19,401
This is a ticking time bomb.
You've gotta throw yourself on it.

1726
01:36:19,445 --> 01:36:21,985
- People are gonna hate me.
- And then, they will forgive you.

1727
01:36:22,031 --> 01:36:24,491
A guy admitting that he's a
gigantic asshole on television?

1728
01:36:24,534 --> 01:36:26,204
People empathize with that.

1729
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:29,540
- Why don't we just put out a statement?
- They need to see you.

1730
01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:32,670
Sharon's specials,
they get 10 million viewers.

1731
01:36:32,708 --> 01:36:35,208
She is a crusader.
If she takes you on as a cause...

1732
01:36:35,253 --> 01:36:37,173
she's going to ask real questions.

1733
01:36:37,213 --> 01:36:39,053
I will drill you
as if you were doing a deposition.

1734
01:36:39,090 --> 01:36:40,550
What to say, what not to say.

1735
01:36:40,591 --> 01:36:41,721
A trained monkey?

1736
01:36:41,759 --> 01:36:43,879
A trained monkey
who doesn't get the lethal injection.

1737
01:36:45,137 --> 01:36:48,597
Nick, this case
is about what people think of you.

1738
01:36:48,641 --> 01:36:50,391
They need to like you.

1739
01:36:50,434 --> 01:36:54,274
Now, you do this and you will reach
millions of those people.

1740
01:36:55,439 --> 01:36:57,939
Maybe I only need to reach one.

1741
01:37:07,410 --> 01:37:08,200
Hello?

1742
01:37:08,244 --> 01:37:09,454
Hey, baby.

1743
01:37:10,913 --> 01:37:12,503
One minute.

1744
01:37:21,257 --> 01:37:22,717
- Hey.
- Hey.

1745
01:37:22,758 --> 01:37:23,718
You clearing out?

1746
01:37:23,759 --> 01:37:25,589
No, I'm just cleaning up.

1747
01:37:25,636 --> 01:37:27,216
Let us come in and say goodbye.

1748
01:37:27,263 --> 01:37:28,313
I'll come by before...

1749
01:37:28,347 --> 01:37:30,097
let us give you a hand.

1750
01:37:36,272 --> 01:37:38,732
Yeah, you gotta
clear everything out, here.

1751
01:37:40,401 --> 01:37:43,111
Dorothy is a real stickler.

1752
01:37:44,447 --> 01:37:47,737
Not even a spare hanger
can you leave behind.

1753
01:37:50,328 --> 01:37:51,929
Gotta make sure nothing's tucked inside.

1754
01:37:54,415 --> 01:37:55,415
A sock...

1755
01:37:56,334 --> 01:37:59,134
Or undies or what have you.

1756
01:38:03,966 --> 01:38:05,296
You did a real good job.

1757
01:38:07,303 --> 01:38:09,433
Where is the money, sweetheart?

1758
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:13,940
Look under her dress.

1759
01:38:15,645 --> 01:38:16,905
He talked you into this?

1760
01:38:16,938 --> 01:38:18,268
I talked him into it.

1761
01:38:18,314 --> 01:38:20,324
The second you leave,
I'm calling the cops.

1762
01:38:20,816 --> 01:38:24,486
Your glasses are fake.
Your hair's dyed all hamster.

1763
01:38:24,529 --> 01:38:27,609
You say your name's Nancy, but you
don't even answer to it half the time.

1764
01:38:27,657 --> 01:38:30,117
You're hiding. I don't know why,
and I don't really care.

1765
01:38:30,159 --> 01:38:32,199
But you ain't gonna call the cops.

1766
01:38:32,537 --> 01:38:34,617
And I don't think you've
ever really been hit before.

1767
01:38:40,837 --> 01:38:42,837
Holy shit.

1768
01:38:45,883 --> 01:38:48,683
Sorry, but we really need the money.

1769
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:50,349
Next place, be more careful, okay?

1770
01:38:50,388 --> 01:38:52,748
There are a lot of people out there
a lot worse than we are.

1771
01:39:27,341 --> 01:39:28,971
Excuse me. You can't sleep here.

1772
01:39:56,579 --> 01:39:59,669
I did not kill my wife.

1773
01:40:00,666 --> 01:40:03,956
Why don't you try it again?
A little less wooden.

1774
01:40:04,003 --> 01:40:05,093
I didn't kill my wife.

1775
01:40:06,923 --> 01:40:08,633
- What are you doing?
- Every time you look smug...

1776
01:40:08,674 --> 01:40:11,344
Or annoyed or tense,
I'm gonna hit you with a gummy bear.

1777
01:40:11,385 --> 01:40:13,345
- That's supposed to make me less tense?
- Let's try it again.

1778
01:40:13,387 --> 01:40:16,677
Mr. dunne, from what I understand,
you and your wife had some bumps.

1779
01:40:17,725 --> 01:40:21,685
Yeah, we had some tough years.
I lost my job.

1780
01:40:21,729 --> 01:40:22,729
You both did.

1781
01:40:25,441 --> 01:40:27,321
We both lost our jobs.

1782
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:29,900
I had to move back home
so we could take care of my mother...

1783
01:40:29,946 --> 01:40:32,486
Who was dying of cancer
and my dad, who had...

1784
01:40:32,532 --> 01:40:34,282
your dad's scorched earth.

1785
01:40:34,325 --> 01:40:35,995
Let's talk about your mom,
how close you were.

1786
01:40:36,035 --> 01:40:37,195
Go on.

1787
01:40:37,245 --> 01:40:39,755
For a while,
things had been building up.

1788
01:40:39,789 --> 01:40:43,289
"Built up" implies that an explosion
is coming. No.

1789
01:40:43,334 --> 01:40:45,754
At a certain point,
we got on the wrong track.

1790
01:40:46,587 --> 01:40:48,207
I had a moment of weakness.

1791
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:50,666
Your "moment" was over 15 months.

1792
01:40:54,470 --> 01:40:56,560
I disrespected my wife.

1793
01:40:57,223 --> 01:40:59,643
And I disrespected my marriage.

1794
01:41:00,101 --> 01:41:01,481
And I'll always regret it.

1795
01:41:02,228 --> 01:41:03,058
That works.

1796
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:05,524
Don't be afraid to play up
the dufus husband thing, Nick.

1797
01:41:05,565 --> 01:41:07,275
"I was an idiot. I'm a fuck-up.

1798
01:41:07,316 --> 01:41:08,146
"Everything I do is wrong."

1799
01:41:08,192 --> 01:41:10,242
I know.
What men are supposed to do in general.

1800
01:41:12,363 --> 01:41:13,413
- Thank you.
- How do you feel?

1801
01:41:13,447 --> 01:41:16,657
I feel good.
Go, can you pass me that box, please?

1802
01:41:17,076 --> 01:41:19,696
It's Amy's 33rd birthday present
to me.

1803
01:41:19,745 --> 01:41:20,745
You hate that watch.

1804
01:41:20,788 --> 01:41:22,868
No, go. I love that watch.

1805
01:41:22,915 --> 01:41:24,915
Just like I love this tie.

1806
01:41:24,959 --> 01:41:28,089
Just like I love my wife.

1807
01:41:58,451 --> 01:41:59,831
It's you!

1808
01:41:59,869 --> 01:42:01,869
It's you.

1809
01:42:02,705 --> 01:42:04,705
I'm sorry.

1810
01:42:05,374 --> 01:42:06,714
I'm sorry.

1811
01:42:07,627 --> 01:42:09,627
Good God.

1812
01:42:09,670 --> 01:42:11,050
Last week...

1813
01:42:11,547 --> 01:42:16,717
I threatened to leave, and he said
he'd find me and he'd kill me.

1814
01:42:17,053 --> 01:42:19,223
So, I disappeared.

1815
01:42:20,389 --> 01:42:22,219
I lost the baby.

1816
01:42:22,725 --> 01:42:24,515
I couldn't even tell my parents.

1817
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:28,480
I'm so ashamed and I'm so afraid.

1818
01:42:29,232 --> 01:42:30,402
Well, he is looking for you.

1819
01:42:31,067 --> 01:42:33,027
He showed up on my doorstep
three days ago.

1820
01:42:33,069 --> 01:42:35,569
He tracked me from my letters to you.

1821
01:42:36,697 --> 01:42:37,907
You saved them.

1822
01:42:38,491 --> 01:42:39,531
Knowing you were out there...

1823
01:42:39,575 --> 01:42:42,195
Was the only thing that's kept me going
these past few years.

1824
01:42:42,245 --> 01:42:43,625
Let's go to the police.
You can explain everything.

1825
01:42:43,663 --> 01:42:44,963
No, I can't turn up now.

1826
01:42:44,997 --> 01:42:48,077
I'd be a pariah. Everyone would hate me.

1827
01:42:49,919 --> 01:42:52,209
Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison?

1828
01:42:52,255 --> 01:42:54,095
He should go to prison
for what he's done.

1829
01:42:56,926 --> 01:42:59,386
I'm setting you up at my lake house.

1830
01:42:59,428 --> 01:43:00,428
It's utterly secluded.

1831
01:43:01,848 --> 01:43:03,678
Why are you so good to me?

1832
01:43:03,724 --> 01:43:05,064
You know why.

1833
01:43:05,101 --> 01:43:06,231
Excuse me.

1834
01:43:06,269 --> 01:43:07,389
I know you, don't I?

1835
01:43:07,436 --> 01:43:08,226
No.

1836
01:43:08,271 --> 01:43:10,231
You're one of the nolan girls, right?

1837
01:43:10,273 --> 01:43:13,153
No, we're from winnipeg. Excuse us.

1838
01:43:13,192 --> 01:43:14,072
We should leave.

1839
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:15,190
Just a second.

1840
01:43:15,778 --> 01:43:19,028
That was boney. I'll call her later.

1841
01:43:19,073 --> 01:43:20,953
Tanner. Nice to see you.

1842
01:43:21,242 --> 01:43:22,372
Sharon! Hi.

1843
01:43:22,410 --> 01:43:24,080
Hope this is worth my while.

1844
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:25,250
You're gonna be very happy.

1845
01:43:25,705 --> 01:43:26,505
Sharon.

1846
01:43:26,539 --> 01:43:28,749
Ms. schieber.
Thank you so much for doing this.

1847
01:43:28,791 --> 01:43:30,921
Can I get you anything to drink or eat
before we get started?

1848
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:32,960
No, I had some gummy bears.

1849
01:43:34,046 --> 01:43:35,626
What the fuck?

1850
01:43:36,799 --> 01:43:37,929
I'm sorry?

1851
01:43:38,342 --> 01:43:42,222
We have a major shocking development
in the amazing Amy disappearance.

1852
01:43:42,263 --> 01:43:43,643
We go live to that story now.

1853
01:43:43,681 --> 01:43:44,971
Oh, my God.

1854
01:43:47,143 --> 01:43:48,943
You little slut.

1855
01:43:48,978 --> 01:43:51,978
My name is Andie Fitzgerald.

1856
01:43:52,982 --> 01:43:54,652
I met Nicholas dunne...

1857
01:43:54,692 --> 01:43:58,322
When he was my creative writing teacher
at mill valley.

1858
01:43:58,362 --> 01:44:00,452
Why is she dressed like a babysitter?

1859
01:44:00,489 --> 01:44:01,949
I am deeply ashamed...

1860
01:44:01,991 --> 01:44:05,121
Of having been romantically involved
with a married man.

1861
01:44:05,161 --> 01:44:07,081
The girl with the giant cum-on-me tits.

1862
01:44:07,121 --> 01:44:09,121
I truly believed we were in love.

1863
01:44:09,165 --> 01:44:11,005
Now, she looks like a fucking mennonite.

1864
01:44:12,502 --> 01:44:13,962
I know that is no excuse.

1865
01:44:14,003 --> 01:44:15,303
No, it is not.

1866
01:44:15,338 --> 01:44:19,678
I do not, in my heart, believe
Nick dunne would have killed for me.

1867
01:44:19,717 --> 01:44:22,137
My prayers go out to everyone
who loves Amy.

1868
01:44:22,178 --> 01:44:25,178
I apologize for the pain
this has caused them.

1869
01:44:30,394 --> 01:44:32,354
We have loved Nick dunne like a son.

1870
01:44:33,189 --> 01:44:34,569
That love ended today.

1871
01:44:34,857 --> 01:44:36,477
Come on, you're staring at ghosts.

1872
01:44:36,526 --> 01:44:39,186
He met our trust with lie after lie.

1873
01:44:39,529 --> 01:44:41,449
We now absolutely believe...

1874
01:44:41,489 --> 01:44:43,869
Nick is involved in the disappearance
of our daughter.

1875
01:44:43,908 --> 01:44:46,158
Our amazing Amy.

1876
01:44:47,036 --> 01:44:49,156
This just got very exciting.

1877
01:44:49,872 --> 01:44:51,582
We need a moment.

1878
01:44:53,584 --> 01:44:55,344
We're gonna have to bow out of this.

1879
01:44:55,378 --> 01:44:57,179
- Nothing has changed.
- Everything has changed.

1880
01:44:57,213 --> 01:44:59,633
An hour ago, we were ahead of this. Now?

1881
01:44:59,674 --> 01:45:01,314
- I can handle this.
- We're on the defense.

1882
01:45:01,342 --> 01:45:03,392
This is a completely different dynamic.

1883
01:45:03,427 --> 01:45:06,177
- I can handle it.
- She's going to eat you alive.

1884
01:45:06,722 --> 01:45:08,392
Just trust me.

1885
01:45:12,770 --> 01:45:14,150
Okay.

1886
01:45:14,188 --> 01:45:15,268
Great.

1887
01:45:16,107 --> 01:45:17,567
Mic him.

1888
01:45:37,295 --> 01:45:39,095
One, two, three, four, five.

1889
01:45:45,428 --> 01:45:46,098
Thank you.

1890
01:45:47,597 --> 01:45:48,887
He shouldn't smile at the makeup artist.

1891
01:45:48,931 --> 01:45:49,931
Yeah, no kidding.

1892
01:45:54,604 --> 01:45:57,734
Roll tape. Five... four...

1893
01:45:57,773 --> 01:45:59,403
Three... two...

1894
01:46:01,611 --> 01:46:04,531
Seriously, I can't believe
how fucking good you were.

1895
01:46:04,572 --> 01:46:06,032
- Amy brings out the best in me.
- Don't.

1896
01:46:06,073 --> 01:46:09,243
Keep it together, you two.
At least for the next 24 hours.

1897
01:46:09,285 --> 01:46:11,705
People still hate you.
Women want to scratch your eyes out.

1898
01:46:11,746 --> 01:46:13,616
Andie was really good TV.

1899
01:46:13,664 --> 01:46:15,714
- She's a good person.
- Therein lies the problem.

1900
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:16,750
Ride this out...

1901
01:46:16,792 --> 01:46:19,802
And when Sharon airs tomorrow,
we'll be looking at a whole new you.

1902
01:46:19,837 --> 01:46:21,417
But, until then...

1903
01:46:21,464 --> 01:46:23,424
Don't show your face.

1904
01:46:23,466 --> 01:46:25,296
No problem.

1905
01:46:41,609 --> 01:46:42,989
Welcome.

1906
01:46:44,987 --> 01:46:46,817
Make yourself at home.

1907
01:46:46,864 --> 01:46:50,834
I've got music, satellite...

1908
01:46:50,868 --> 01:46:51,828
Netflix.

1909
01:46:51,869 --> 01:46:52,949
He was her teacher!

1910
01:46:52,995 --> 01:46:53,785
Roku.

1911
01:46:54,539 --> 01:46:57,039
Internet, obviously.

1912
01:46:57,625 --> 01:47:00,345
Here is a supposedly grown man...

1913
01:47:00,378 --> 01:47:04,168
if there is ever anything you have
a taste for and you can't find it...

1914
01:47:04,215 --> 01:47:06,475
Just let me know
and I will get it for you.

1915
01:47:06,509 --> 01:47:09,639
Instead of the a-b-c's,
he taught her the birds and the bees.

1916
01:47:09,679 --> 01:47:12,599
And just think how her mother must feel
at a time like this.

1917
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:14,640
Wine cellar's downstairs.

1918
01:47:18,104 --> 01:47:19,484
I'll get you some clothes, too.

1919
01:47:19,522 --> 01:47:22,942
Not that I don't appreciate
bait shop chic.

1920
01:47:24,110 --> 01:47:26,610
The floors are heated,
just dial to your liking.

1921
01:47:26,654 --> 01:47:29,824
There's robes and towels.
The shower has steam.

1922
01:47:29,866 --> 01:47:32,196
The bathtub has a massage cycle.

1923
01:47:34,036 --> 01:47:36,076
There's a great view,
if you're in the mood.

1924
01:47:36,122 --> 01:47:37,662
Blackout curtains if you're not.

1925
01:47:37,707 --> 01:47:40,167
The bed is savoir.

1926
01:47:40,209 --> 01:47:42,459
You'll never get a better sleep.

1927
01:47:46,340 --> 01:47:48,680
This is just what I need.

1928
01:47:50,136 --> 01:47:52,046
I'm so exhausted.

1929
01:47:53,556 --> 01:47:55,716
I'll leave you to it, then.

1930
01:47:57,476 --> 01:48:00,226
Amy, I am so happy that you are here.

1931
01:48:01,230 --> 01:48:04,360
And I don't want you to worry
for one moment.

1932
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:06,360
There are cameras everywhere.

1933
01:48:06,402 --> 01:48:09,282
The exterior, all along the grounds,
the entryway.

1934
01:48:09,322 --> 01:48:09,992
Anyone...

1935
01:48:10,489 --> 01:48:12,739
Who is caught coming or going...

1936
01:48:15,995 --> 01:48:17,585
Will be recorded.

1937
01:48:19,165 --> 01:48:21,885
You are more than safe.

1938
01:48:23,836 --> 01:48:27,336
And I am not letting you get away again.

1939
01:49:13,094 --> 01:49:14,684
- Good morning!
- Don't do that!

1940
01:49:16,430 --> 01:49:17,560
I'm sorry.

1941
01:49:19,559 --> 01:49:21,059
I need to feel safe.

1942
01:49:21,394 --> 01:49:24,404
You are very safe.

1943
01:49:26,607 --> 01:49:28,227
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing.

1944
01:49:28,276 --> 01:49:30,986
Amy, I'm not Nick.

1945
01:49:31,028 --> 01:49:33,028
It's hard for me.

1946
01:49:35,950 --> 01:49:39,580
After so many years
under someone's thumb...

1947
01:49:41,831 --> 01:49:43,152
I know just what that feels like.

1948
01:49:44,041 --> 01:49:46,041
You were never under my thumb.

1949
01:49:46,627 --> 01:49:48,667
- On your leash.
- Never.

1950
01:49:48,713 --> 01:49:50,213
A new start.

1951
01:49:51,507 --> 01:49:53,127
Decent clothes.

1952
01:49:54,051 --> 01:49:56,301
Hair dye. Makeup. Tweezers.

1953
01:49:56,596 --> 01:49:58,096
There's a gym overlooking the lake.

1954
01:49:58,472 --> 01:50:02,022
The sooner you look like yourself,
the sooner you'll feel like yourself.

1955
01:50:02,059 --> 01:50:05,189
I'll get groceries for tonight, we'll watch
Sharon schieber, and finally move on.

1956
01:50:05,229 --> 01:50:07,769
I think that's something
I should watch on my own.

1957
01:50:08,191 --> 01:50:09,901
Nonsense.

1958
01:50:13,529 --> 01:50:14,949
I'll be back.

1959
01:50:16,574 --> 01:50:18,744
And I am looking forward...

1960
01:50:18,784 --> 01:50:21,704
To my reunion with Amy elliott.

1961
01:50:44,894 --> 01:50:46,064
Great.

1962
01:50:47,104 --> 01:50:49,194
Good evening, I'm Sharon schieber.

1963
01:50:49,232 --> 01:50:50,862
- Tonight, exclusively...
- Hurry up.

1964
01:50:51,776 --> 01:50:56,156
A husband breaks his silence,
not just on his wife's disappearance...

1965
01:50:56,197 --> 01:50:59,987
But on his infidelity,
and all those shocking rumors.

1966
01:51:02,453 --> 01:51:04,003
Nick dunne...

1967
01:51:04,038 --> 01:51:07,538
You're probably the most hated man
in America right now.

1968
01:51:07,583 --> 01:51:10,173
I probably am.
And I probably deserve it.

1969
01:51:10,211 --> 01:51:11,801
I bought that tie.

1970
01:51:11,838 --> 01:51:13,878
Did you kill your wife, Nick?

1971
01:51:13,923 --> 01:51:17,013
I did not kill my wife.

1972
01:51:17,677 --> 01:51:19,217
I am not a murderer.

1973
01:51:19,262 --> 01:51:21,182
But you were unfaithful.

1974
01:51:21,222 --> 01:51:23,432
I was unfaithful.

1975
01:51:23,474 --> 01:51:25,144
And I am deeply ashamed.

1976
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:27,524
And, on top of that,
you allowed Amy's parents...

1977
01:51:27,812 --> 01:51:30,562
Her friends,
all the people in your hometown...

1978
01:51:30,606 --> 01:51:35,526
Believe you were a loving husband,
desperate to find his missing wife.

1979
01:51:35,570 --> 01:51:37,450
Well, I am desperate
to find my missing wife.

1980
01:51:37,488 --> 01:51:40,488
You say that, but I'm wondering
how you expect us to believe you...

1981
01:51:40,533 --> 01:51:42,243
Now that we know you're a liar.

1982
01:51:42,535 --> 01:51:45,665
I didn't come forward with my affair...

1983
01:51:45,705 --> 01:51:48,875
Because I knew it would make me look
really, really bad.

1984
01:51:49,709 --> 01:51:51,499
But I don't care about that anymore.

1985
01:51:51,544 --> 01:51:53,174
I just want to find my wife.

1986
01:51:53,212 --> 01:51:55,762
- I'm just trying to get clear...
- Let me be clear.

1987
01:51:55,798 --> 01:52:00,218
Just because I am not a murderer
doesn't make me a good guy.

1988
01:52:00,261 --> 01:52:01,431
I'm not a good guy.

1989
01:52:01,846 --> 01:52:04,306
I was a bad husband to a great wife.

1990
01:52:04,682 --> 01:52:06,432
I broke the vow that I made to her.

1991
01:52:06,684 --> 01:52:09,234
Those are pretty words, Nick.

1992
01:52:09,562 --> 01:52:11,312
But what does that really mean to you?

1993
01:52:11,355 --> 01:52:13,395
It basically means
that I was a con artist.

1994
01:52:14,358 --> 01:52:17,568
I met Amy elliott seven years ago.

1995
01:52:17,612 --> 01:52:19,202
I was completely transfixed.

1996
01:52:19,655 --> 01:52:21,565
Amy can do that to you.

1997
01:52:21,616 --> 01:52:24,156
I was this average guy
from an average place...

1998
01:52:24,202 --> 01:52:26,202
With mediocre aspirations.

1999
01:52:26,245 --> 01:52:28,745
And I met a woman who dazzled me.

2000
01:52:28,789 --> 01:52:30,749
And I wanted her to love me...

2001
01:52:30,791 --> 01:52:33,131
So I pretended to be better than I was.

2002
01:52:34,003 --> 01:52:37,673
When we got married,
I promised to be that guy.

2003
01:52:37,715 --> 01:52:39,545
That guy who works harder.

2004
01:52:39,592 --> 01:52:41,802
That guy who, who lives and acts...

2005
01:52:41,844 --> 01:52:44,764
And loves with as much passion
as she does.

2006
01:52:45,014 --> 01:52:46,224
But I failed her.

2007
01:52:47,141 --> 01:52:48,502
Instead of doing what was right...

2008
01:52:49,769 --> 01:52:50,939
I did what was easy.

2009
01:52:51,687 --> 01:52:55,317
You talk like a man who believes
he can make amends to his wife.

2010
01:52:55,358 --> 01:52:56,978
Who believes his wife is still alive.

2011
01:52:57,026 --> 01:52:58,316
She is still alive.

2012
01:53:00,196 --> 01:53:03,026
Will you look at that camera for me?

2013
01:53:03,366 --> 01:53:06,326
Will you look in the lens...

2014
01:53:06,369 --> 01:53:08,329
And talk to your wife?

2015
01:53:08,371 --> 01:53:11,461
If she is out there,
able to hear and see you tonight...

2016
01:53:11,499 --> 01:53:14,169
What would you like to say to her, Nick?

2017
01:53:17,713 --> 01:53:20,013
Amy, I love you.

2018
01:53:20,716 --> 01:53:23,506
You're the best person I've ever known.

2019
01:53:23,553 --> 01:53:28,023
And I've taken myself to the woodshed
for the way that I've treated you.

2020
01:53:28,057 --> 01:53:30,017
And if you come back, I promise...

2021
01:53:30,059 --> 01:53:32,559
I will spend every day
making it up to you.

2022
01:53:33,062 --> 01:53:36,902
I will be the man
that I promised you I would be.

2023
01:53:39,485 --> 01:53:40,485
I love you.

2024
01:53:41,404 --> 01:53:42,994
Come home.

2025
01:53:47,743 --> 01:53:48,743
Here.

2026
01:53:54,876 --> 01:53:56,496
Regardless of what you thought...

2027
01:53:56,544 --> 01:53:58,714
What does it say?

2028
01:53:58,754 --> 01:54:00,304
I think we can all agree...

2029
01:54:00,339 --> 01:54:01,839
Oh, my God. You fucking killed it.

2030
01:54:01,883 --> 01:54:03,053
There's more to him
than meets the eye.

2031
01:54:03,092 --> 01:54:04,213
They're going crazy for you.

2032
01:54:04,218 --> 01:54:08,718
They disliked me, they liked me,
they hated me.

2033
01:54:08,764 --> 01:54:10,394
And now they love me.

2034
01:54:10,433 --> 01:54:13,393
A candor and an honesty
that's worthy of respect.

2035
01:54:13,436 --> 01:54:15,346
He's certainly earned mine.

2036
01:54:16,189 --> 01:54:17,269
What is it?

2037
01:54:20,109 --> 01:54:23,279
I'm Sharon schieber. Good night.

2038
01:54:28,201 --> 01:54:30,991
Margo dunne, this is a search warrant
for your property.

2039
01:54:31,037 --> 01:54:33,247
I usually ignore tipline calls...

2040
01:54:33,289 --> 01:54:37,879
But a neighbor was concerned about
a strange man around your woodshed.

2041
01:54:38,294 --> 01:54:39,254
Call Tanner.

2042
01:54:39,295 --> 01:54:40,465
Okay. Fuck!

2043
01:54:44,592 --> 01:54:46,052
Girlfriend's real cute, Nick.

2044
01:54:47,303 --> 01:54:48,384
Is that what this is about?

2045
01:54:49,805 --> 01:54:54,555
I have treated you more than fair
throughout this entire investigation.

2046
01:54:54,602 --> 01:54:56,902
I gave you the benefit of the doubt
over and over.

2047
01:54:56,938 --> 01:54:58,438
Every time you said something stupid...

2048
01:54:58,481 --> 01:55:00,861
I thought, "maybe he's just stupid."

2049
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:03,440
But I was wrong.
That's what this is about.

2050
01:55:03,486 --> 01:55:04,606
Are these the clubs
you don't play golf with?

2051
01:55:04,654 --> 01:55:05,494
None of that is mine.

2052
01:55:05,947 --> 01:55:07,527
None of this was put here by me.

2053
01:55:07,573 --> 01:55:11,123
Those are nice clubs.
You got the makings of a real man cave.

2054
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:14,290
Everything just waiting
until the wife goes away for good.

2055
01:55:14,330 --> 01:55:15,410
Nick!

2056
01:55:16,666 --> 01:55:19,586
- You can't do that!
- Of course we can.

2057
01:55:27,885 --> 01:55:30,465
Amy, it's time to move on.

2058
01:55:30,513 --> 01:55:32,223
What can I do to help?

2059
01:55:32,932 --> 01:55:34,482
I need some time to think.

2060
01:55:34,517 --> 01:55:37,017
- That's the last thing you need.
- Desi...

2061
01:55:37,061 --> 01:55:39,651
twenty years,
you have kept me dangling.

2062
01:55:39,689 --> 01:55:43,359
Finally, last night, you came to me,
and you chose me.

2063
01:55:44,068 --> 01:55:45,398
Follow that instinct.

2064
01:55:45,444 --> 01:55:47,864
Don't trust the instinct
that left you beaten and homeless...

2065
01:55:48,406 --> 01:55:51,576
Sleeping in your car,
fearing for your life.

2066
01:55:54,912 --> 01:55:57,622
I'm not gonna force myself on you.

2067
01:56:00,042 --> 01:56:02,712
I understand what you're saying, desi.

2068
01:56:03,963 --> 01:56:05,593
I do.

2069
01:56:08,926 --> 01:56:10,926
I've been so mistreated for so long.

2070
01:56:13,598 --> 01:56:16,478
I've forgotten how to behave.

2071
01:56:22,231 --> 01:56:24,531
I'll move in here tomorrow...

2072
01:56:24,567 --> 01:56:27,147
And we'll work it out together.

2073
01:56:29,238 --> 01:56:32,948
I just want you to be you again.

2074
01:56:40,791 --> 01:56:42,311
They only took margo to fuck with you.

2075
01:56:42,335 --> 01:56:44,045
She's not spending
another fucking second in there.

2076
01:56:44,086 --> 01:56:46,836
I'm gonna go in,
and I'm gonna tell them everything.

2077
01:56:47,507 --> 01:56:49,257
What?

2078
01:56:51,260 --> 01:56:52,890
We tell boney very little.

2079
01:56:52,929 --> 01:56:55,059
Without a body,
without a murder weapon...

2080
01:56:55,097 --> 01:56:57,387
Their only hope is a confession.

2081
01:56:57,433 --> 01:56:59,393
So, you let them do all the talking.

2082
01:56:59,435 --> 01:57:01,555
That way,
we can jump-start your defense.

2083
01:57:01,604 --> 01:57:03,984
The truth is my defense.

2084
01:57:09,946 --> 01:57:10,896
Recognize these?

2085
01:57:10,947 --> 01:57:13,067
Yes.
It's Amy's anniversary present to me.

2086
01:57:13,115 --> 01:57:14,905
Was that how she told you
she was pregnant, Nick?

2087
01:57:14,951 --> 01:57:17,451
Mommy, daddy, baby,
and that made you real mad?

2088
01:57:17,954 --> 01:57:19,124
No.

2089
01:57:20,373 --> 01:57:22,493
- Recognize this?
- Never seen that before in my life.

2090
01:57:22,708 --> 01:57:25,958
It's Amy's diary.
We found this at your father's house.

2091
01:57:27,964 --> 01:57:29,264
Is this your wife's handwriting?

2092
01:57:29,298 --> 01:57:31,298
- He's not a handwriting ex...
- Looks like it.

2093
01:57:31,342 --> 01:57:32,472
Our experts thought so, too.

2094
01:57:33,803 --> 01:57:35,513
Do you wanna
play a little true or false?

2095
01:57:36,264 --> 01:57:37,474
Sure.

2096
01:57:37,515 --> 01:57:41,985
"And then he brushes the sugar off my lips
so he can taste me."

2097
01:57:43,104 --> 01:57:45,114
Yeah, that's true.

2098
01:57:46,357 --> 01:57:48,357
You thought quinoa was a fish?

2099
01:57:49,652 --> 01:57:50,992
That is also true, yes.

2100
01:57:53,155 --> 01:57:55,275
She wanted to get pregnant,
you assaulted her.

2101
01:57:55,324 --> 01:57:57,334
I hit her? No, never happened.

2102
01:57:57,368 --> 01:57:58,988
- "Pushed," it says "pushed."
- Absolutely not.

2103
01:57:59,036 --> 01:58:00,116
I never touched her.

2104
01:58:02,540 --> 01:58:04,170
She tried to buy a gun.

2105
01:58:04,834 --> 01:58:06,714
I doubt that, but I don't know.

2106
01:58:08,129 --> 01:58:09,759
Shall I read the last entry?

2107
01:58:09,797 --> 01:58:10,837
Sure.

2108
01:58:12,133 --> 01:58:14,263
"This man may kill me."

2109
01:58:14,302 --> 01:58:16,512
In her own words,
"this man may kill me."

2110
01:58:16,554 --> 01:58:18,684
It's kind of a convenient end note.

2111
01:58:25,188 --> 01:58:26,608
For future reference...

2112
01:58:26,647 --> 01:58:28,977
The truth,
you are not a handwriting expert.

2113
01:58:29,025 --> 01:58:30,075
Okay, I know.

2114
01:58:38,492 --> 01:58:40,332
Judy's missing handle.

2115
01:58:41,871 --> 01:58:44,161
Big as a two-by-four, right?
Big as a club.

2116
01:58:44,207 --> 01:58:46,957
We found this day one,
in the fireplace in your home office.

2117
01:58:47,001 --> 01:58:49,671
We didn't know what the hell it was,
but fire in July?

2118
01:58:49,712 --> 01:58:50,552
We bagged it.

2119
01:58:50,588 --> 01:58:51,708
I've never seen that before either.

2120
01:58:51,756 --> 01:58:54,376
We just tested it.
Fire doesn't erase blood, Nick.

2121
01:58:54,425 --> 01:58:56,635
So, finally, Nicholas dunne...

2122
01:58:56,677 --> 01:58:58,297
You're under arrest
for the murder of your wife.

2123
01:58:58,346 --> 01:58:59,556
Do not say another word.

2124
01:58:59,597 --> 01:59:00,927
- What about my side?
- Nick!

2125
01:59:14,278 --> 01:59:15,738
More coffee?

2126
01:59:15,780 --> 01:59:17,570
I'd love it.

2127
01:59:19,867 --> 01:59:23,497
Remember that time we skipped school
and drove to the cape?

2128
01:59:23,538 --> 01:59:26,078
God, yeah. Lobster right from the ocean.

2129
01:59:26,123 --> 01:59:27,753
This reminds me of that.

2130
01:59:28,251 --> 01:59:29,921
Never-ending holiday.

2131
01:59:31,462 --> 01:59:33,672
You're not bored?

2132
01:59:33,714 --> 01:59:35,224
Desi, how could I be bored?

2133
01:59:35,258 --> 01:59:37,718
You can discuss
18th-century symphonies...

2134
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:40,680
19th-century impressionists,
quote proust in French.

2135
01:59:41,055 --> 01:59:45,175
Nick's idea of culture
was a reality TV marathon...

2136
01:59:45,226 --> 01:59:47,096
With one hand down his boxers.

2137
01:59:49,105 --> 01:59:50,695
I really have to get going.

2138
01:59:51,023 --> 01:59:54,363
But I will be back
just as soon as I can.

2139
02:00:00,950 --> 02:00:02,030
My keys.

2140
02:00:07,248 --> 02:00:09,248
Thank you.

2141
02:00:20,469 --> 02:00:22,049
That's how the kids wear it.

2142
02:01:22,865 --> 02:01:26,695
Dunne? You got one hell of a lawyer.

2143
02:01:29,539 --> 02:01:30,709
Hey.

2144
02:01:31,123 --> 02:01:33,503
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Are you?

2145
02:01:33,543 --> 02:01:34,793
Yeah.

2146
02:01:34,836 --> 02:01:36,706
Let's go.

2147
02:01:38,548 --> 02:01:39,758
What does this mean?

2148
02:01:39,799 --> 02:01:41,969
Well, you're out on bond.

2149
02:01:42,009 --> 02:01:45,219
You can relax at home
while we prep for trial.

2150
02:01:50,726 --> 02:01:52,726
Keep your head down.

2151
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:10,540
Tanner, is there
any fucking lead on Amy?

2152
02:02:10,580 --> 02:02:12,580
I've got two of my best guys on it.

2153
02:02:13,082 --> 02:02:14,712
She's air.

2154
02:02:16,752 --> 02:02:19,712
Come home, Amy. I dare you.

2155
02:03:16,938 --> 02:03:19,478
Mr. collings is home.

2156
02:03:19,524 --> 02:03:21,904
Hello, Mr. collings.

2157
02:03:21,943 --> 02:03:23,823
I've missed you.

2158
02:03:23,861 --> 02:03:25,491
I've been thinking...

2159
02:03:25,947 --> 02:03:28,117
I don't wanna be without you.

2160
02:03:28,824 --> 02:03:31,164
Stay with me.

2161
02:03:31,202 --> 02:03:34,162
And when all this dies down,
we'll go to Greece, like you said.

2162
02:03:34,205 --> 02:03:36,505
Octopus and scrabble?

2163
02:03:38,501 --> 02:03:40,751
How long do you think until it's done?

2164
02:03:40,795 --> 02:03:44,385
Not long. Six months for the trial.
Sentencing will be quick.

2165
02:03:44,882 --> 02:03:45,972
He'll appeal.

2166
02:03:46,008 --> 02:03:48,138
I can watch the rest overseas.

2167
02:04:05,528 --> 02:04:06,818
Go slowly.

2168
02:04:06,863 --> 02:04:07,743
But I want it.

2169
02:04:28,217 --> 02:04:29,797
Don't rush.

2170
02:04:29,844 --> 02:04:31,934
Just do it.

2171
02:04:40,396 --> 02:04:41,936
Harder.

2172
02:06:20,496 --> 02:06:23,666
You fucking bitch.

2173
02:06:32,341 --> 02:06:36,011
Don't you worry,
you're gonna have lots of babies.

2174
02:06:37,638 --> 02:06:41,138
Her wounds are consistent with rape.
There was semen present.

2175
02:06:41,184 --> 02:06:42,344
We'll make sure it's a match.

2176
02:06:42,351 --> 02:06:44,101
Yeah, it'll match.

2177
02:06:44,145 --> 02:06:46,615
Thank you very much.

2178
02:06:46,647 --> 02:06:48,147
What do you think?

2179
02:06:48,191 --> 02:06:49,481
Are we pals again?

2180
02:06:49,525 --> 02:06:53,065
Now that I know
you didn't murder your wife, yes.

2181
02:06:53,112 --> 02:06:54,072
What do you think?

2182
02:06:54,113 --> 02:06:57,033
Kidnapping? The story's insane.

2183
02:06:59,202 --> 02:07:01,662
She's on fairly heavy painkillers.

2184
02:07:01,704 --> 02:07:03,624
It's okay. I want to help.

2185
02:07:03,664 --> 02:07:05,084
Ms. dunne, I know
what you've been through...

2186
02:07:05,124 --> 02:07:07,464
So we'll keep this very brief.

2187
02:07:07,502 --> 02:07:09,882
Can you walk us through what happened?

2188
02:07:12,507 --> 02:07:15,127
That morning, the doorbell rang.

2189
02:07:16,010 --> 02:07:18,010
So normal.

2190
02:07:18,054 --> 02:07:19,894
I opened the door.

2191
02:07:20,515 --> 02:07:22,355
So strange.

2192
02:07:22,975 --> 02:07:26,595
Since high school,
he won't ever go away.

2193
02:07:26,646 --> 02:07:29,726
And I've just tried to be nice to him.

2194
02:07:29,774 --> 02:07:31,404
Answer his letters.

2195
02:07:31,651 --> 02:07:33,651
Keep him calm.

2196
02:07:35,071 --> 02:07:36,531
Oh, my God.

2197
02:07:37,156 --> 02:07:38,776
I've encouraged him.

2198
02:07:38,824 --> 02:07:40,624
You can't blame yourself.

2199
02:07:42,245 --> 02:07:44,415
He pushed inside.

2200
02:07:45,998 --> 02:07:48,038
And he grabbed me.

2201
02:07:48,751 --> 02:07:51,841
But I got away, and ran to the kitchen.

2202
02:07:52,171 --> 02:07:53,881
And he clubbed me.

2203
02:07:54,340 --> 02:07:55,760
I collapsed.

2204
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:59,850
That club was actually the handle
to a punch and Judy puppet.

2205
02:07:59,887 --> 02:08:01,307
Right.

2206
02:08:02,223 --> 02:08:03,643
Treasure hunt.

2207
02:08:05,560 --> 02:08:07,600
I'd hidden some puppets at go's...

2208
02:08:07,645 --> 02:08:09,365
then how did desi have that handle?

2209
02:08:11,232 --> 02:08:13,152
I'd just found it.

2210
02:08:13,901 --> 02:08:16,321
It must have fallen off.

2211
02:08:18,239 --> 02:08:21,909
I was holding it when desi pushed in.
So, he got it from me.

2212
02:08:21,951 --> 02:08:23,161
About that woodshed...

2213
02:08:23,202 --> 02:08:24,872
He took me to his lake house.

2214
02:08:25,454 --> 02:08:27,164
Tied me to his bed.

2215
02:08:27,206 --> 02:08:29,746
Back to the woodshed real quick.
Real quick.

2216
02:08:29,792 --> 02:08:31,632
When you went
to place the puppets there...

2217
02:08:31,669 --> 02:08:33,069
Did you notice that it was packed...

2218
02:08:33,087 --> 02:08:34,247
lots of stuff.

2219
02:08:34,297 --> 02:08:38,717
Corresponding to purchases made
on credit cards in your husband's name.

2220
02:08:38,759 --> 02:08:40,259
Nick and credit cards.

2221
02:08:40,303 --> 02:08:42,853
He buys, I nag. I don't know, probably.

2222
02:08:42,889 --> 02:08:45,679
He hid a lot of stuff at go's.
They're very close.

2223
02:08:46,225 --> 02:08:50,555
Now, may I go back
to where I was being held prisoner...

2224
02:08:50,605 --> 02:08:53,365
By a man with a history
of mental problems?

2225
02:08:53,399 --> 02:08:54,480
Please continue, Ms. dunne.

2226
02:08:58,779 --> 02:09:00,859
Desi assaulted me that night.

2227
02:09:01,824 --> 02:09:03,664
Every night.

2228
02:09:04,785 --> 02:09:07,195
He tied me up like a dog.

2229
02:09:08,581 --> 02:09:11,081
And then, he'd punish me.

2230
02:09:13,002 --> 02:09:15,052
Starve me.

2231
02:09:16,339 --> 02:09:18,259
Shave me.

2232
02:09:19,884 --> 02:09:21,844
Sodomize me.

2233
02:09:22,637 --> 02:09:24,467
There were cameras everywhere.

2234
02:09:24,514 --> 02:09:27,474
Please find this. Please find the tapes.

2235
02:09:29,143 --> 02:09:32,353
She slit his throat with a box cutter.

2236
02:09:33,439 --> 02:09:35,649
How did she manage
to get a hold of a box cutter...

2237
02:09:35,691 --> 02:09:38,281
If he had her tied up the whole time?

2238
02:09:39,237 --> 02:09:41,277
Can't you just be happy
your wife is home and safe?

2239
02:09:42,073 --> 02:09:44,033
Amy, we found your diary.

2240
02:09:44,075 --> 02:09:48,165
It contains many concerning allegations
of mental and physical abuse.

2241
02:09:48,204 --> 02:09:51,084
Well, it's the ugly truth.

2242
02:09:51,916 --> 02:09:53,416
Nick didn't want a baby.

2243
02:09:55,253 --> 02:09:58,553
He has a temper. We had money problems.

2244
02:09:59,465 --> 02:10:00,585
But I love him.

2245
02:10:00,633 --> 02:10:02,383
Then why did you try to buy a gun?

2246
02:10:04,345 --> 02:10:06,425
I'm sorry, I feel myself fading.

2247
02:10:06,472 --> 02:10:08,312
If I could just clarify one thing...

2248
02:10:08,349 --> 02:10:11,559
if this case had been left
in your deeply incompetent hands...

2249
02:10:11,602 --> 02:10:13,482
My husband would be on death row...

2250
02:10:13,771 --> 02:10:17,521
And I'd be tied, still, spread-eagle...

2251
02:10:17,817 --> 02:10:21,487
Ms. dunne, you've been very brave.
We're finished.

2252
02:10:22,363 --> 02:10:24,533
Now, I have to ask you...

2253
02:10:24,574 --> 02:10:27,414
Do you feel safe
going home with your husband?

2254
02:10:39,839 --> 02:10:42,469
We prayed to God,
and God has answered our prayers.

2255
02:10:42,508 --> 02:10:43,878
Amy dunne is home.

2256
02:10:43,926 --> 02:10:46,006
Now, I know there are
a lot of questions and concerns...

2257
02:10:46,053 --> 02:10:48,063
But for right now, we wanna sit tight...

2258
02:10:48,097 --> 02:10:53,017
And just be thankful and grateful
for this miracle on the Mississippi.

2259
02:11:00,484 --> 02:11:02,284
Excuse me. Excuse us, folks.

2260
02:11:54,038 --> 02:11:55,248
We love you, Amy!

2261
02:11:59,877 --> 02:12:01,707
All right, you can stop pretending now.

2262
02:12:01,754 --> 02:12:03,424
I'm not pretending.

2263
02:12:04,131 --> 02:12:05,841
You were perfect.

2264
02:12:06,467 --> 02:12:09,007
The Nick I saw on TV,
that's the Nick I fell in love with.

2265
02:12:09,053 --> 02:12:11,763
You do know I was just telling you
what you wanted to hear, right?

2266
02:12:11,806 --> 02:12:13,636
That's how well you know me.

2267
02:12:13,683 --> 02:12:16,313
You know me in your marrow.

2268
02:12:17,311 --> 02:12:18,901
Okay.

2269
02:12:18,938 --> 02:12:22,268
You need to tell me
exactly what happened.

2270
02:12:23,568 --> 02:12:24,818
Take off your clothes.

2271
02:12:25,319 --> 02:12:28,529
I need to make sure
you're not wearing a wire.

2272
02:12:41,836 --> 02:12:45,836
You killed someone, Amy.
You're a murderer.

2273
02:12:45,882 --> 02:12:47,472
I'm a fighter.

2274
02:12:47,508 --> 02:12:49,968
I fought my way back to you.

2275
02:12:50,011 --> 02:12:51,851
You killed a guy.

2276
02:12:51,888 --> 02:12:53,848
You slashed his throat
with a box cutter.

2277
02:12:53,890 --> 02:12:58,560
You went on national television
and begged for me to save your life.

2278
02:12:59,145 --> 02:13:00,405
And I obliged.

2279
02:13:00,438 --> 02:13:01,898
But I want that Nick.

2280
02:13:02,231 --> 02:13:03,651
I'm leaving.

2281
02:13:03,691 --> 02:13:06,321
You really think that's smart?

2282
02:13:06,986 --> 02:13:07,946
Shampoo.

2283
02:13:10,698 --> 02:13:14,618
Wounded, raped wife battles her way
back to her husband...

2284
02:13:14,660 --> 02:13:16,540
And he deserts her.

2285
02:13:16,579 --> 02:13:17,619
They'll destroy you.

2286
02:13:18,372 --> 02:13:19,872
Neighbors will shun you.

2287
02:13:19,916 --> 02:13:24,126
And I'll make sure that no one forgets
the pain you caused me.

2288
02:13:26,214 --> 02:13:31,304
I don't want anything to do
with your groupies outside.

2289
02:13:31,886 --> 02:13:33,506
Once they go...

2290
02:13:34,388 --> 02:13:35,308
I go.

2291
02:13:35,348 --> 02:13:38,768
Give it the night. Sleep on it.

2292
02:13:55,618 --> 02:13:57,198
Was there ever a baby?

2293
02:13:57,495 --> 02:13:59,585
There can be.

2294
02:14:03,584 --> 02:14:04,594
Good night.

2295
02:14:57,513 --> 02:14:59,183
Hey, Nick!

2296
02:15:11,319 --> 02:15:12,569
Hello, handsome.

2297
02:15:15,698 --> 02:15:17,448
Crepe?

2298
02:15:18,159 --> 02:15:19,079
Sure.

2299
02:15:19,118 --> 02:15:20,828
She was his dream girl.

2300
02:15:20,870 --> 02:15:24,290
And when this spoiled, rich,
entitled little boy couldn't have her...

2301
02:15:24,332 --> 02:15:25,712
He took her.

2302
02:15:33,090 --> 02:15:34,430
You must be so proud.

2303
02:15:41,682 --> 02:15:43,682
It's been four hours.

2304
02:15:44,185 --> 02:15:47,025
Nick? Nick? What's next for you and Amy?

2305
02:15:51,192 --> 02:15:54,032
Right now, it's all about our marriage.

2306
02:15:54,862 --> 02:15:58,372
When two people love each other
and can't make that work...

2307
02:15:58,407 --> 02:16:00,827
That's the real tragedy.

2308
02:16:04,580 --> 02:16:06,620
Kiss my cheek.

2309
02:16:12,964 --> 02:16:15,764
I can't believe that fucking spider
is America's sweetheart.

2310
02:16:15,800 --> 02:16:18,010
She told me she killed desi.

2311
02:16:18,052 --> 02:16:19,392
Not self-defense. Murder.

2312
02:16:19,428 --> 02:16:20,968
- Can't we get a wire?
- That's not gonna work.

2313
02:16:21,013 --> 02:16:22,183
She told you once before.

2314
02:16:22,223 --> 02:16:24,563
Yeah, because she had me strip naked,
and stand in the shower.

2315
02:16:24,600 --> 02:16:27,850
I swear, you two are the most
fucked-up people I've ever known.

2316
02:16:27,895 --> 02:16:29,355
And I specialize in fucked-up.

2317
02:16:29,605 --> 02:16:31,435
You and Amy under the same roof?

2318
02:16:31,482 --> 02:16:33,282
You should pitch that
as reality television.

2319
02:16:33,901 --> 02:16:36,281
Amy dunne,
and the miracle on the Mississippi.

2320
02:16:36,320 --> 02:16:38,820
Nick and I have been through
some bad patches.

2321
02:16:38,865 --> 02:16:40,205
We've had our dark days.

2322
02:16:40,241 --> 02:16:42,081
But we thank you so much...

2323
02:16:42,577 --> 02:16:47,117
For supporting us in our new life together,
for forgiving Nick.

2324
02:16:47,373 --> 02:16:51,093
Really, your encouragement
means the world.

2325
02:16:51,127 --> 02:16:52,537
She's good.

2326
02:16:52,587 --> 02:16:55,167
Amazing Amy and the humbled husband.

2327
02:16:55,214 --> 02:16:57,304
The real housewives of branson.

2328
02:16:57,341 --> 02:16:58,431
Take care of this guy, will you?

2329
02:16:58,467 --> 02:17:00,068
I can't believe you're just leaving now.

2330
02:17:00,094 --> 02:17:01,644
You are not at risk anymore.

2331
02:17:01,679 --> 02:17:03,219
I'm the definition of "at risk."

2332
02:17:03,264 --> 02:17:07,394
You got a book deal, a lifetime movie,
you franchised the bar.

2333
02:17:07,435 --> 02:17:08,485
You may wanna thank her.

2334
02:17:11,522 --> 02:17:12,942
Just don't piss her off.

2335
02:17:13,774 --> 02:17:14,534
See you, guys.

2336
02:17:16,903 --> 02:17:18,573
Elvis has left Missouri.

2337
02:17:18,613 --> 02:17:19,703
She had to have made a mistake.

2338
02:17:19,739 --> 02:17:22,029
We need to check Amy's story,
piece by piece.

2339
02:17:22,074 --> 02:17:23,954
Nick, I can't do anything.

2340
02:17:24,368 --> 02:17:27,198
We had the national spotlight on us,
we stained the rug.

2341
02:17:27,246 --> 02:17:28,966
The case is with the feds now,
they're done.

2342
02:17:28,998 --> 02:17:30,038
That doesn't mean you have to be done.

2343
02:17:30,458 --> 02:17:32,248
It does.

2344
02:18:03,824 --> 02:18:05,284
What are you doing?

2345
02:18:07,203 --> 02:18:08,793
Couldn't sleep.

2346
02:18:08,829 --> 02:18:09,499
Come on...

2347
02:18:10,122 --> 02:18:12,292
Let me tuck you back in.

2348
02:18:24,971 --> 02:18:27,601
You know you can sleep with me, right?

2349
02:18:29,684 --> 02:18:31,774
Yeah, it's just...

2350
02:18:31,811 --> 02:18:33,311
I need more time.

2351
02:18:33,354 --> 02:18:36,904
I would never, ever hurt you.

2352
02:18:38,693 --> 02:18:41,153
I do need you to participate, though.

2353
02:18:41,195 --> 02:18:43,355
I need you to do your part.

2354
02:18:53,666 --> 02:18:54,416
Okay.

2355
02:18:55,418 --> 02:18:58,248
Everything you have heard
about my wife...

2356
02:18:58,296 --> 02:18:59,666
Is a lie.

2357
02:18:59,714 --> 02:19:03,804
She is a calculating,
murderous psychopath.

2358
02:19:04,427 --> 02:19:05,967
And I have been complicit...

2359
02:19:06,012 --> 02:19:07,142
Nick!

2360
02:19:12,810 --> 02:19:14,980
Nick? Breakfast.

2361
02:19:15,021 --> 02:19:15,851
Honey?

2362
02:19:19,567 --> 02:19:22,027
We should hold hands.

2363
02:19:22,069 --> 02:19:25,159
Not the entire time,
but on and off throughout.

2364
02:19:26,574 --> 02:19:28,784
"So, Nick, how does it feel
to have your wife back?"

2365
02:19:31,412 --> 02:19:33,292
"It's fantastic.

2366
02:19:33,331 --> 02:19:36,381
"How many people are lucky enough
to get a second chance at love?"

2367
02:19:36,417 --> 02:19:38,127
"Fantastic" is a little flippant.

2368
02:19:38,544 --> 02:19:39,674
"Amazing"?

2369
02:19:39,712 --> 02:19:42,552
I need you
to admit that you got the credit cards...

2370
02:19:42,590 --> 02:19:45,590
And that you hid all that stuff at go's
and that you pushed me.

2371
02:19:46,344 --> 02:19:49,394
I'm gonna need
those three things to feel safe.

2372
02:19:50,598 --> 02:19:52,428
You have to own this, Nick.

2373
02:19:53,226 --> 02:19:56,766
Don't worry. I know exactly what to say.

2374
02:19:58,356 --> 02:20:00,106
Nick.

2375
02:20:03,069 --> 02:20:05,699
What a beautiful home.

2376
02:20:06,948 --> 02:20:09,618
I so appreciate
you giving us this time, Nick.

2377
02:20:09,659 --> 02:20:11,829
You went on national television...

2378
02:20:11,869 --> 02:20:14,329
And told people that I murdered my wife.

2379
02:20:14,372 --> 02:20:15,622
I go where the story goes.

2380
02:20:15,665 --> 02:20:18,635
You implied that I had carnal relations
with my sister.

2381
02:20:18,668 --> 02:20:22,208
I didn't use the "I" word.
I said you two were "extremely close."

2382
02:20:22,255 --> 02:20:26,935
You and a panel of nitwits
diagnosed me as a sociopath.

2383
02:20:28,135 --> 02:20:29,885
Ice-breaker.

2384
02:20:33,599 --> 02:20:35,389
To go with your robot dog.

2385
02:20:35,434 --> 02:20:37,484
I'll go find Amy.

2386
02:20:39,522 --> 02:20:41,612
She's downstairs.

2387
02:20:44,110 --> 02:20:45,740
- What is it?
- It's for you.

2388
02:20:45,778 --> 02:20:47,198
Open it.

2389
02:20:47,488 --> 02:20:49,238
I don't need any more gifts from you.

2390
02:20:49,282 --> 02:20:50,992
Open it.

2391
02:21:03,546 --> 02:21:05,206
I didn't touch you.

2392
02:21:05,256 --> 02:21:06,296
You didn't need to.

2393
02:21:06,340 --> 02:21:09,550
Bullshit. That notice of disposal.

2394
02:21:09,594 --> 02:21:11,104
I have that. You threw it out.

2395
02:21:11,137 --> 02:21:12,967
The notice, yes.

2396
02:21:13,347 --> 02:21:14,217
I want a blood test.

2397
02:21:14,765 --> 02:21:15,845
I want a paternity test.

2398
02:21:16,642 --> 02:21:17,982
I love tests.

2399
02:21:18,019 --> 02:21:19,849
You can teach those people
to hate me all you want.

2400
02:21:19,896 --> 02:21:22,606
I don't care. I am leaving you.

2401
02:21:24,734 --> 02:21:27,444
I won't have to teach your child
to hate you.

2402
02:21:27,486 --> 02:21:29,856
He'll do that all by himself.

2403
02:21:29,906 --> 02:21:31,776
You fucking cunt!

2404
02:21:33,659 --> 02:21:36,039
I'm the cunt you married.

2405
02:21:36,078 --> 02:21:37,868
The only time you liked yourself...

2406
02:21:37,914 --> 02:21:41,584
Was when you were trying to be someone
this cunt might like.

2407
02:21:41,626 --> 02:21:45,086
I'm not a quitter. I'm that cunt.

2408
02:21:48,841 --> 02:21:52,091
I've killed for you.
Who else can say that?

2409
02:21:53,346 --> 02:21:55,886
You think you would be happy
with a nice midwestern girl?

2410
02:21:55,932 --> 02:21:58,772
No way, baby. I'm it.

2411
02:21:58,809 --> 02:22:02,229
Look, you're delusional. You're insane.

2412
02:22:02,271 --> 02:22:03,771
Why would you even want this?

2413
02:22:04,148 --> 02:22:05,228
Yes, I loved you.

2414
02:22:05,274 --> 02:22:08,744
And then all we did was resent each other,
and try to control each other.

2415
02:22:08,778 --> 02:22:09,818
And cause each other pain.

2416
02:22:10,321 --> 02:22:12,111
That's marriage.

2417
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:17,164
Now, I'm getting ready.

2418
02:22:42,478 --> 02:22:45,558
I can't watch you play house
with that thing for the next 18 years.

2419
02:22:45,606 --> 02:22:47,266
I can't just walk away.

2420
02:22:47,316 --> 02:22:48,896
You could get custody.

2421
02:22:48,943 --> 02:22:52,823
No, I won't. And you know it.

2422
02:22:52,864 --> 02:22:55,374
It's gonna be my child.
I'm not gonna leave it.

2423
02:22:55,992 --> 02:22:57,792
You wanna stay.

2424
02:22:57,827 --> 02:23:01,747
I have a responsibility.
It's not about what I want anymore.

2425
02:23:01,789 --> 02:23:03,039
You wanna stay with her.

2426
02:23:13,676 --> 02:23:14,716
You're breaking my heart.

2427
02:23:15,178 --> 02:23:18,808
Go, you're my voice of reason.

2428
02:23:18,848 --> 02:23:21,348
I need you with me on this.

2429
02:23:21,392 --> 02:23:23,852
Of course I'm with you.

2430
02:23:26,480 --> 02:23:30,480
I was with you before we were even born.

2431
02:23:32,236 --> 02:23:35,026
We've been through the darkness.

2432
02:23:35,573 --> 02:23:38,873
We've come out, united.

2433
02:23:41,871 --> 02:23:44,041
We communicate.

2434
02:23:46,334 --> 02:23:48,844
We're honest with each other.

2435
02:23:48,878 --> 02:23:50,378
Right?

2436
02:23:52,298 --> 02:23:54,798
We're partners in crime.

2437
02:23:58,179 --> 02:23:59,009
And?

2438
02:24:00,890 --> 02:24:02,220
And?

2439
02:24:05,728 --> 02:24:07,648
We're gonna be parents.

2440
02:24:09,357 --> 02:24:10,977
My goodness!

2441
02:24:11,400 --> 02:24:13,360
- How exciting!
- Thank you.

2442
02:24:18,157 --> 02:24:20,527
"What are you thinking?"

2443
02:24:23,371 --> 02:24:25,581
"How are you feeling?"

2444
02:24:27,542 --> 02:24:30,172
"What have we done to each other?"

2445
02:24:31,754 --> 02:24:33,844
"What will we do?"
