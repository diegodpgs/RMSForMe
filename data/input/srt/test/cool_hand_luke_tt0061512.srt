1
00:01:34,413 --> 00:01:36,404
What are you doing there, fella?

2
00:01:39,093 --> 00:01:40,685
I just cut these...

3
00:01:43,693 --> 00:01:45,604
You better come along with us.

4
00:02:04,013 --> 00:02:05,685
Taking it off here, Boss?

5
00:02:06,253 --> 00:02:08,084
Yeah, take it off, Dragline.

6
00:02:15,853 --> 00:02:18,970
- Wiping it off here, Boss?
- All right, Koko, wipe it off.

7
00:02:19,053 --> 00:02:21,089
Drinking it up here, Boss?

8
00:02:21,293 --> 00:02:23,249
All right, drink it up, Gambler.

9
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:25,524
Hey, Rabbitt, water him down.

10
00:02:35,373 --> 00:02:39,412
- All right, break it up!
- Yes, sir!

11
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:56,724
You eyeballing there, Society?

12
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:58,451
Checking my yo-yo, Boss.

13
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,206
Drag, new-meat bus.

14
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:19,771
Bunch. Must be half a dozen new-meat.

15
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:25,486
- No more than five, for a cold drink.
- You're on.

16
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:29,045
Babalugats, got a bet here.

17
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:05,444
All right, you men get lined up here.

18
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:09,042
Dog Boy, shut them dogs up.

19
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:11,647
They just smell new-meat, that's all, Boss.

20
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:20,050
What did they bring us today?

21
00:04:23,093 --> 00:04:24,606
Come on, Blue.

22
00:04:25,653 --> 00:04:29,931
"Gibson, 507. Manslaughter."

23
00:04:30,013 --> 00:04:31,605
Good for a two spot.

24
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:34,003
It was an accident.
I've never been in trouble before.

25
00:04:34,093 --> 00:04:35,321
You call the Captain, "Captain."

26
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:39,645
"Edgar Potter, 302 and resisting arrest."

27
00:04:39,853 --> 00:04:40,922
"One year."

28
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:43,402
I was trying to keep in out of the rain.

29
00:04:44,453 --> 00:04:47,092
Get the wax out of your ears.
You call the Captain, "Captain."

30
00:04:47,173 --> 00:04:48,162
Yes, sir.

31
00:04:48,253 --> 00:04:50,050
And you call the rest of us "Boss,"
you hear?

32
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:51,168
Yes, Boss.

33
00:04:51,253 --> 00:04:54,484
This man is going to make us
proud of him, Mr. Hunnicutt.

34
00:04:55,893 --> 00:04:57,451
"Raymond Pratt."

35
00:04:58,013 --> 00:04:59,048
Yes, Captain.

36
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,601
"Breaking, entering, and assault."

37
00:05:02,013 --> 00:05:03,571
Five spot.

38
00:05:03,853 --> 00:05:05,047
And a seaman.

39
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:08,526
Suspect that should come in real handy
around here, Captain.

40
00:05:08,613 --> 00:05:09,807
Maybe.

41
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,565
"Lucas Jackson."

42
00:05:11,653 --> 00:05:12,847
Here, Captain.

43
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:16,721
"Maliciously destroying municipal
property while under the influence."

44
00:05:16,813 --> 00:05:18,485
What was that?

45
00:05:20,093 --> 00:05:22,687
Cutting the heads off of parking meters,
Captain.

46
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,091
We ain't never had one of them before.

47
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:29,448
Where do you think
that's going to get you?

48
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:32,286
I guess you could say
I wasn't thinking, Captain.

49
00:05:34,173 --> 00:05:36,812
It says here that you did real good
in the war.

50
00:05:36,893 --> 00:05:40,283
A Silver Star, Bronze Star,
couple of Purple Hearts...

51
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:44,124
Sergeant. Then come out
the same way you went in.

52
00:05:44,573 --> 00:05:45,767
Buck Private.

53
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:48,768
Like I was just passing time, Captain.

54
00:05:50,173 --> 00:05:53,370
Well, you got yourself some time now.
"Two years."

55
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,246
Well, hell, that ain't much.

56
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,052
We got a couple of men here
doing 20 spot.

57
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:01,522
We got one that's got all of it.

58
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:05,447
We got all kinds,
and you're going to fit in real good.

59
00:06:06,013 --> 00:06:08,971
Of course, in case you get rabbit
in your blood...

60
00:06:09,053 --> 00:06:13,444
and you decide to take off for home,
you get a bonus of some time...

61
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:16,650
and a set of leg chains to keep you
slowed down just a little bit.

62
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:20,487
For your own good, you'll learn the rules.

63
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:24,083
It's all up to you.

64
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:29,649
Now, I can be a good guy
or I can be one real mean son of a bitch.

65
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:37,007
It's all up to you.

66
00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:39,525
All right, let's move it.

67
00:06:56,013 --> 00:06:57,844
One at a time. Move it!

68
00:07:08,773 --> 00:07:10,286
Them clothes got laundry numbers
on them.

69
00:07:10,373 --> 00:07:13,171
You remember your number and always
wear the ones that has your number.

70
00:07:13,253 --> 00:07:15,209
Any man forgets his number
spends a night in the box.

71
00:07:15,293 --> 00:07:17,409
These here spoons you keep with you.

72
00:07:17,493 --> 00:07:19,609
Any man loses his spoon
spends a night in the box.

73
00:07:19,693 --> 00:07:21,763
There's no playing grab-ass
or fighting in the building.

74
00:07:21,853 --> 00:07:24,765
You got a grudge against another man,
you fight him Saturday afternoon.

75
00:07:24,853 --> 00:07:28,004
Any man playing grab-ass or fighting
in the building spends a night in the box.

76
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:31,369
First bell's at five minutes of 8:00
when you will get in your bunk.

77
00:07:31,453 --> 00:07:32,772
Last bell is at 8:00.

78
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,606
Any man not in his bunk at 8:00
spends the night in the box.

79
00:07:35,693 --> 00:07:37,684
There is no smoking
in the prone position in bed.

80
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:40,333
To smoke you must have both legs
over the side of your bunk.

81
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:42,449
Any man caught smoking
in the prone position in bed...

82
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:44,125
spends a night in the box.

83
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,248
You get two sheets.

84
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,528
Every Saturday, you put the clean sheet
on the top...

85
00:07:47,613 --> 00:07:48,648
the top sheet on the bottom...

86
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:50,451
the bottom sheet you turn in
to the laundry boy.

87
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:53,001
Any man turns in the wrong sheet
spends a night in the box.

88
00:07:53,093 --> 00:07:55,288
No one'll sit on the bunks
with dirty pants on.

89
00:07:55,373 --> 00:07:58,570
Any man with dirty pants on sitting on
the bunk spends a night in the box.

90
00:07:58,653 --> 00:08:01,645
Any man don't bring back his empty
pop bottle spends a night in the box.

91
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:04,850
Any man loud talking
spends a night in the box.

92
00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:07,288
You got questions, you come to me.

93
00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:11,483
I'm Carr, the floor walker.
I'm responsible for order in here.

94
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:14,004
Any man don't keep order
spends a night in...

95
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,321
The box.

96
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:19,212
I hope you ain't going to be a hard case.

97
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:31,047
Ain't but four. What did I tell you?
You owe me a cold drink.

98
00:08:31,133 --> 00:08:32,691
I owe you. I owe you.

99
00:08:33,573 --> 00:08:35,564
Move it.

100
00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:41,248
Hey, any of you guys from Connecticut?

101
00:08:43,093 --> 00:08:44,162
Forget it.

102
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:45,806
Wash them up!

103
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:48,532
Wash them up!

104
00:08:49,493 --> 00:08:50,892
Move!

105
00:08:57,773 --> 00:09:01,891
Well, what are you still doing here?
Get at them beans! Move!

106
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,325
- Twenty-seven.
- Twenty-seven.

107
00:09:16,893 --> 00:09:18,645
Next time you stay out of my place.

108
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:20,928
You try that again and I'll bounce you
all over the floor.

109
00:09:21,013 --> 00:09:22,924
Well, man, I didn't know
it was your special seat.

110
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:24,731
You don't take another man's seat, man.

111
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:26,405
It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything...

112
00:09:26,493 --> 00:09:30,042
You better mind you manners, boy.
You're acting like a hillbilly tramp.

113
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:32,089
"Tramp." There you go, beauty.

114
00:09:32,253 --> 00:09:34,767
Hey, yeah, man,
you got your bull-gang name now.

115
00:09:34,853 --> 00:09:37,526
Yeah, well, it ain't no worse
than some I been called.

116
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:38,728
When I was in the Navy...

117
00:09:38,813 --> 00:09:40,041
All you new-meats...

118
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:42,727
you're going to have to shape up
fast and hard for this gang.

119
00:09:42,813 --> 00:09:44,087
We got rules here.

120
00:09:44,173 --> 00:09:45,208
In order to learn them...

121
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,966
you gotta do more work
with your ears than with your mouth.

122
00:09:50,053 --> 00:09:51,691
Somebody say something?

123
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:53,729
No, I didn't say nothing, Boss.

124
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:55,847
What have we got there?

125
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:57,412
Got a Lucas Jackson.

126
00:09:58,653 --> 00:10:01,725
You don't have a name here
until Dragline gives you one.

127
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:06,331
Maybe we ought to call it "No-Ears."
You don't listen much, do you, boy?

128
00:10:06,413 --> 00:10:08,165
I ain't heard that much worth listening to.

129
00:10:08,253 --> 00:10:11,643
Just a lot of guys laying down
a lot of rules and regulations.

130
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:15,206
New-meat looks like a poker player, Drag.

131
00:10:15,293 --> 00:10:16,885
Yeah, come on. Bet that eight.

132
00:10:16,973 --> 00:10:18,565
Yeah, that wouldn't surprise me none.

133
00:10:18,653 --> 00:10:20,245
I know you got $5 pocket money.

134
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:24,008
That would buy you a whole fistful
of cards. You in or out?

135
00:10:24,293 --> 00:10:25,567
Out.

136
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,605
All right, come on.
It's a nickel to you, Drag. Let's go.

137
00:10:33,413 --> 00:10:35,449
- Come on, Drag.
- Dime.

138
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:38,961
First bell.

139
00:10:44,053 --> 00:10:45,771
All right, break it up.

140
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:50,327
How'd you get that scar?

141
00:10:50,413 --> 00:10:51,482
What scar?

142
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:54,602
Last bell.

143
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:55,928
Last bell.

144
00:11:25,973 --> 00:11:27,247
Fifty, Boss.

145
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,925
Right, Carr. Fifty.

146
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:41,290
Getting up here, Carr?

147
00:11:41,373 --> 00:11:43,170
Hey, now.

148
00:11:58,533 --> 00:11:59,807
- Twenty-eight.
- Twenty-nine.

149
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:01,087
- Thirty.
- Thirty-one.

150
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:03,084
- Thirty-two.
- Thirty-three.

151
00:12:03,173 --> 00:12:05,323
- Thirty-four.
- Thirty-five.

152
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,971
- Twenty-one.
- Twenty-two.

153
00:12:48,053 --> 00:12:49,406
- Twenty-three.
- Twenty-four.

154
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:50,642
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-six.

155
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:52,007
- Twenty-seven.
- Twenty-eight.

156
00:12:52,093 --> 00:12:53,765
- Twenty-nine.
- Thirty.

157
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:55,764
- Thirty-one.
- Thirty-two.

158
00:12:55,853 --> 00:12:57,684
- Thirty-three.
- Thirty-four.

159
00:12:57,773 --> 00:12:59,889
- Thirty-five.
- Thirty-six.

160
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:04,125
Get out of my eyeballing seat,
you new-meat dummy.

161
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,530
I'm a salesman. I used to drive
these roads all the time.

162
00:13:37,893 --> 00:13:40,646
Drag, it's going to be
one hot mother today.

163
00:13:42,013 --> 00:13:44,766
Yeah, I reckon the bear's going
to be walking the road today.

164
00:13:44,853 --> 00:13:46,923
Then I'm lucky I got me a broom.

165
00:13:47,013 --> 00:13:51,404
I work on top, real cush job. I would
hate to be down in that ditch today.

166
00:13:51,493 --> 00:13:52,926
We work in a ditch?

167
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:55,407
What's the matter with you?

168
00:13:55,493 --> 00:13:59,088
All your big-time driving around,
you ain't never seen a chain gang before?

169
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:02,449
I ain't used to hard work, neither.
I always tried to avoid it.

170
00:14:02,653 --> 00:14:04,962
I ain't exactly crazy about it, myself.

171
00:14:05,213 --> 00:14:08,205
Well, man, it's going to be
one tough day to learn on.

172
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:12,526
Now, Koko, why don't you give
one of these new-meat a break...

173
00:14:12,613 --> 00:14:14,205
and let him use your broom today?

174
00:14:14,293 --> 00:14:17,490
Oh, hell, Society,
I ain't going down in that ditch.

175
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:20,804
Well, I sure would appreciate it.
I ain't in too good a shape right now.

176
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,453
Hey, Koko, you really
going to sell your job?

177
00:14:23,773 --> 00:14:25,206
Well, Drag, I may have to.

178
00:14:25,293 --> 00:14:28,171
Maybe that Lucas War Hero
would give you your price.

179
00:14:28,253 --> 00:14:30,164
I'll give you 50 cents.

180
00:14:30,253 --> 00:14:34,405
50 cents for a sweet job like that?
That's worth at least a buck.

181
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:35,687
I'll make it a dollar.

182
00:14:35,773 --> 00:14:37,092
Dollar's a deal.

183
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,329
Where'd you get that about "war hero"?

184
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:45,244
A little birdie told me.

185
00:14:45,373 --> 00:14:47,170
Tearing the heads off of... What was it?

186
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,686
Gumball machines?

187
00:14:49,293 --> 00:14:51,761
What kind of thing is that
for a grown man?

188
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:56,969
You know how it is. Small town.
Not much to do in the evening.

189
00:14:58,813 --> 00:15:01,088
Mostly, was just settling an old score.

190
00:15:16,693 --> 00:15:19,253
Boss, I made this arrangement
with this man to take his broom.

191
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,561
Get to work.

192
00:15:23,653 --> 00:15:26,884
- You don't understand, I made this deal.
- Get moving.

193
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,844
But I made this arrangement.

194
00:15:32,253 --> 00:15:33,527
Get to work.

195
00:15:52,253 --> 00:15:55,882
Better take it easy.
You won't last two hours.

196
00:15:58,813 --> 00:16:00,531
Taking it off here, Boss?

197
00:16:00,613 --> 00:16:02,490
Yeah, Dragline, take it off there.

198
00:16:02,573 --> 00:16:05,645
- Taking it off here, Boss?
- Yeah, take it off there.

199
00:16:06,453 --> 00:16:08,171
Drinking it up here, Boss?

200
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:24,688
Man bear-clawed here, Boss!

201
00:16:46,653 --> 00:16:47,881
All right, men.

202
00:16:48,093 --> 00:16:49,606
Let's eat them beans!

203
00:17:04,813 --> 00:17:06,929
Cold drink he don't make it.

204
00:17:08,893 --> 00:17:10,087
You on.

205
00:17:10,173 --> 00:17:12,164
Hey, Babalugats, got a bet here.

206
00:17:35,893 --> 00:17:39,442
- Boss, drinking it up here?
- All right.

207
00:17:44,373 --> 00:17:45,488
Who's that?

208
00:17:46,093 --> 00:17:47,685
That's Godfrey.

209
00:17:47,973 --> 00:17:49,645
The walking boss.

210
00:18:01,893 --> 00:18:03,326
Don't he ever talk?

211
00:18:07,613 --> 00:18:09,490
Think he just said something.

212
00:18:44,293 --> 00:18:46,602
You owe that fella a cold drink.

213
00:19:01,693 --> 00:19:02,762
All right!

214
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:05,322
You, Gibson, step out.

215
00:19:06,853 --> 00:19:09,447
Boss Paul says you wasn't
happy with your job.

216
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:11,728
That you was complaining.

217
00:19:11,813 --> 00:19:14,611
Well, we're going to give you
a chance to think about it.

218
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:15,808
All right.

219
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:17,212
Let's go.

220
00:19:25,573 --> 00:19:27,086
Get them clothes off.

221
00:20:23,053 --> 00:20:24,168
First bell.

222
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:31,488
Plumb busted out. Look like the hard road
finally got to Mr. Lucas War Hero.

223
00:20:31,693 --> 00:20:33,968
I'll be back at it in the morning.
Just need a little nap.

224
00:20:34,053 --> 00:20:37,807
Man, I never thought they'd put him
in the box on his first day.

225
00:20:37,893 --> 00:20:39,963
It was only supposed to be a joke.

226
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:42,332
There ain't no brooms.

227
00:20:42,413 --> 00:20:45,371
Well, can't expect to learn everything
the first day.

228
00:20:46,053 --> 00:20:48,521
May have taught him
a very valuable lesson.

229
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:52,933
You guys sure give him all night
to think about it.

230
00:20:53,013 --> 00:20:55,925
We can't help it if he's square. Huh, Drag?

231
00:20:56,013 --> 00:21:00,165
Of course not. He ain't in the box
because of the joke played on him.

232
00:21:00,773 --> 00:21:02,968
He back-sassed a free man.

233
00:21:03,413 --> 00:21:06,803
They got their rules and we ain't got
nothing to do with that.

234
00:21:07,173 --> 00:21:10,802
Probably happen to him sooner
or later anyway, complainer like him.

235
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:14,205
He's gotta learn the rules,
same as anybody else.

236
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:18,530
Yeah, them poor old bosses need
all the help they can get.

237
00:21:19,013 --> 00:21:20,844
You trying to say something?

238
00:21:25,653 --> 00:21:27,769
Last bell!

239
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,051
Last bell!

240
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:33,686
One of these days I'm gonna have to
flap me up some dust with it.

241
00:21:33,773 --> 00:21:35,729
Forty-nine and one in the box, Boss.

242
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:39,243
Right, Carr, 49 and one in the box.

243
00:22:10,173 --> 00:22:12,243
Putting them on here, Boss?

244
00:22:13,893 --> 00:22:15,212
You see that, you see that?

245
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:16,567
I got eyes, don't I?

246
00:22:16,653 --> 00:22:19,804
How am I not going to see something
that look like that?

247
00:22:23,013 --> 00:22:25,481
Man, oh, man, look at that. Look at that!

248
00:22:33,493 --> 00:22:35,927
- Wiping it off here, Boss?
- Wipe it off.

249
00:22:44,093 --> 00:22:46,891
- Taking them off here, Boss?
- All right, take it off.

250
00:22:46,973 --> 00:22:49,123
Damn things is blocking the scenery.

251
00:22:52,213 --> 00:22:55,250
Oh, man, I'm dying. I'm dying!

252
00:23:02,493 --> 00:23:03,767
Nice broad.

253
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:07,645
Great set.

254
00:23:16,013 --> 00:23:18,652
Lucille, baby.

255
00:23:28,053 --> 00:23:31,489
Oh, man, I'm dying! I'm dying!

256
00:23:34,853 --> 00:23:38,528
She ain't got nothing but one safety pin
holding that thing on!

257
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:42,842
Come on, safety pin, pop!

258
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:47,332
Come on, baby, pop!

259
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:51,407
Hey, Lord...

260
00:23:51,493 --> 00:23:55,372
whatever I done, don't strike me blind
for another couple of minutes.

261
00:23:57,013 --> 00:23:58,446
My Lucille.

262
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:03,245
Your Lucille, boy. Where did you get that?

263
00:24:03,493 --> 00:24:05,324
That's Lucille, you mullet-head.

264
00:24:05,413 --> 00:24:08,723
Anything so innocent, and built like that...

265
00:24:08,813 --> 00:24:10,769
just gotta be named Lucille.

266
00:24:12,893 --> 00:24:15,361
Rub it, baby. Clean that car.

267
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,364
Rub, rub...

268
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:47,803
She doesn't know what she's doing.

269
00:24:48,293 --> 00:24:50,761
Oh, boy, she knows exactly
what she's doing.

270
00:24:50,853 --> 00:24:53,845
She's driving us crazy,
and loving every minute of it!

271
00:24:54,213 --> 00:24:56,852
Shut your mouth about my Lucille.

272
00:25:10,613 --> 00:25:12,649
<i>Old MacDonald had a farm</i>

273
00:25:12,733 --> 00:25:15,327
<i>And on his farm he had a pig</i>

274
00:25:22,853 --> 00:25:24,081
Will you shut up, Babalugats?

275
00:25:24,173 --> 00:25:25,731
Why don't you leave him alone?
He's happy.

276
00:25:25,813 --> 00:25:26,962
Because he's a damn moron!

277
00:25:27,053 --> 00:25:29,169
Why don't you shut your mouth?

278
00:26:17,973 --> 00:26:20,441
- Getting up here, Carr?
- Okay, now.

279
00:26:22,813 --> 00:26:25,725
- Getting up, Carr?
- Yeah.

280
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:32,851
Getting up here, Carr?

281
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:35,686
No. Go up.

282
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:55,690
Oh, man, that little Lucille.

283
00:26:56,373 --> 00:27:00,446
She was really a big lot of little gal,
wasn't she?

284
00:27:02,613 --> 00:27:06,572
Did you see how she was just about
popping out of the top of that dress?

285
00:27:07,053 --> 00:27:08,771
Come on, Drag, cut it out.

286
00:27:09,493 --> 00:27:10,926
And down below...

287
00:27:11,733 --> 00:27:14,531
man, that thing didn't reach
no higher than...

288
00:27:18,093 --> 00:27:21,005
She's liable to catch cold
running around like that.

289
00:27:21,813 --> 00:27:25,567
It was stretched so tight
across her bottom...

290
00:27:25,653 --> 00:27:30,124
I do believe I saw one of them seams
bust loose.

291
00:27:30,893 --> 00:27:32,804
And the opening got wider...

292
00:27:33,813 --> 00:27:37,647
and wider and wider.

293
00:27:37,733 --> 00:27:38,961
Forget it, man.

294
00:27:40,813 --> 00:27:42,724
What do you mean, "forget it"?

295
00:27:43,213 --> 00:27:47,525
Stop beating it into the ground.
You ain't doing nobody no good.

296
00:27:49,453 --> 00:27:52,172
Okay, new-meat. You get some sleep.

297
00:27:53,493 --> 00:27:56,530
And save your strength,
'cause you're going to need it.

298
00:27:58,613 --> 00:27:59,841
Tomorrow.

299
00:28:32,213 --> 00:28:34,249
Hit him! Hit him!

300
00:28:51,693 --> 00:28:52,728
Hey, go get him.

301
00:28:52,813 --> 00:28:54,804
- Nice shot, Drag.
- Stay away from him.

302
00:28:58,733 --> 00:29:00,007
He's still got a chance.

303
00:29:09,173 --> 00:29:10,925
It's a big one.

304
00:29:17,693 --> 00:29:19,206
Come on, Lucas!

305
00:29:28,853 --> 00:29:30,366
Why don't you just stay down, Luke?

306
00:29:30,453 --> 00:29:32,284
He's just going to knock you down again,
buddy.

307
00:29:32,373 --> 00:29:34,204
It's not your fault. He's just too big.

308
00:29:34,293 --> 00:29:36,443
Let him hit you in the nose
and get some blood flowing.

309
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:38,524
Maybe the bosses will stop it
before he kills you.

310
00:29:38,613 --> 00:29:40,046
I don't want to frighten him.

311
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:41,612
Stay down, Luke.

312
00:29:44,053 --> 00:29:47,523
Stay down, Luke. He's gonna kill you.

313
00:30:27,933 --> 00:30:29,161
Stay down!

314
00:30:46,453 --> 00:30:48,842
Somebody ought to stop this thing.

315
00:31:28,613 --> 00:31:29,966
Stay down.

316
00:31:30,573 --> 00:31:31,926
You're beat!

317
00:31:33,213 --> 00:31:35,408
You're going to have to kill me.

318
00:32:42,693 --> 00:32:44,092
All right, pot's right. Here we go.

319
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:48,724
King gets a three, queen, deuce,
seven, pair of savannahs right here.

320
00:32:48,813 --> 00:32:52,123
Deuce gets a four. No help.
Three gets a big ace.

321
00:32:52,213 --> 00:32:53,362
Bet to the savannahs.

322
00:32:53,453 --> 00:32:54,727
Pewter.

323
00:32:57,853 --> 00:32:59,047
I call.

324
00:33:10,013 --> 00:33:11,162
Kick a buck.

325
00:33:11,253 --> 00:33:12,766
A dollar?

326
00:33:15,373 --> 00:33:17,204
One time.

327
00:33:17,613 --> 00:33:19,126
All right, I call.

328
00:33:19,653 --> 00:33:22,406
Hell, if I catch, I'm gonna burn you. I call.

329
00:33:22,573 --> 00:33:25,406
King, three, you got a four,
queen, deuce, gets a five...

330
00:33:25,493 --> 00:33:27,165
and a pair of sevens gets a john.

331
00:33:27,253 --> 00:33:30,768
And the big ace gets... slop in the face.

332
00:33:31,693 --> 00:33:33,809
Okay, you still do the talking.

333
00:33:34,773 --> 00:33:35,922
Pewter again.

334
00:33:36,413 --> 00:33:37,528
I call.

335
00:33:40,493 --> 00:33:42,006
Kick a buck.

336
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:46,011
- What you got?
- Pair of sevens.

337
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:49,324
I can see that, mullet-head.
What have you got in the hole?

338
00:33:51,373 --> 00:33:53,603
He ain't got nothing showing.
Raise his head off.

339
00:33:53,693 --> 00:33:54,762
He's been betting...

340
00:33:54,853 --> 00:33:56,923
All right, then you just call it.

341
00:33:57,573 --> 00:33:58,688
I call.

342
00:33:58,773 --> 00:34:00,764
You've got to see it, Gambler.

343
00:34:00,853 --> 00:34:02,809
I can't. I can't catch a damn thing...

344
00:34:02,893 --> 00:34:05,726
I'm snake-bit. I can't catch. I fold.

345
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:10,087
King, four, three. You got a nine.
Nothing visible.

346
00:34:10,373 --> 00:34:12,933
Pair of sevens and a jack gets a six.

347
00:34:13,013 --> 00:34:15,129
Savannas, you is still a better man.

348
00:34:16,933 --> 00:34:18,332
Pewter.

349
00:34:22,413 --> 00:34:23,562
Kick a buck.

350
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,525
Kick him back a buck!

351
00:34:25,613 --> 00:34:28,081
I'll see your buck and back a buck.

352
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:31,202
Kick a buck.

353
00:34:31,293 --> 00:34:32,362
Damn!

354
00:34:32,453 --> 00:34:33,932
Don't look at me, mullet-head.

355
00:34:35,693 --> 00:34:36,728
Come on.

356
00:34:36,813 --> 00:34:40,169
What're you going to do,
play like a coconut? You got to call him.

357
00:34:40,253 --> 00:34:43,290
I know he's got a pair of kings.
You don't have to stuff them up my nose.

358
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,011
Well, you still got to call him, anyway.

359
00:34:45,093 --> 00:34:46,970
You gotta look at them.

360
00:34:47,053 --> 00:34:49,442
The man's got kings. Get your tail out.

361
00:34:53,053 --> 00:34:57,649
You want to see them? Right there.
One, two, three, four, five.

362
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,123
Nothing. A handful of nothing.

363
00:35:03,213 --> 00:35:05,852
You stupid mullet-head,
he beat you with nothing.

364
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:09,892
Just like today when he kept
coming back at me... with nothing.

365
00:35:13,813 --> 00:35:17,283
Sometimes nothing
can be a real cool hand.

366
00:35:20,373 --> 00:35:21,442
Move over.

367
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:24,322
I'm going to sit in here, next to my boy.

368
00:35:26,413 --> 00:35:28,051
Cool Hand Luke.

369
00:35:30,933 --> 00:35:32,525
Deal.

370
00:35:35,253 --> 00:35:36,368
I'm in this next one.

371
00:35:52,013 --> 00:35:53,002
Hey, Loudmouth!

372
00:35:53,973 --> 00:35:56,851
Come on, get out there.
Your mama's waiting for you.

373
00:35:59,053 --> 00:36:00,771
She never leaves me alone!

374
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:03,204
Be glad you got somebody, kid.

375
00:36:03,373 --> 00:36:05,728
Luke, visitor for you.

376
00:36:18,413 --> 00:36:20,483
- Son.
- Come on, Ma.

377
00:36:20,573 --> 00:36:23,041
<i>Just a closer walk with Thee</i>

378
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:30,603
<i>Grant it, Jesus, is my plea</i>

379
00:36:33,533 --> 00:36:38,448
<i>Daily walkin' close to Thee</i>

380
00:36:39,093 --> 00:36:41,402
- Coming out here, Boss?
- Come on out, Luke.

381
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:45,082
<i>Let it be, dear Lord</i>

382
00:36:45,173 --> 00:36:47,448
<i>Let it be</i>

383
00:36:50,253 --> 00:36:55,202
<i>Through the days of toil that's near</i>

384
00:36:57,133 --> 00:37:02,082
<i>If I fall, dear Lord, who cares?</i>

385
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:10,882
<i>Who but Thee my burden shares?</i>

386
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:16,448
<i>None but Thee, dear Lord</i>

387
00:37:16,533 --> 00:37:19,001
<i>None but Thee</i>

388
00:37:30,893 --> 00:37:32,246
How did you find me?

389
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,166
That Helen...

390
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,642
she sent your things along with a note...

391
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:41,646
and then John here,
he wrote to the police.

392
00:37:46,613 --> 00:37:48,490
Move around here, Boss?

393
00:37:52,413 --> 00:37:54,643
Well, Arletta, I've got to stay here.

394
00:37:58,173 --> 00:38:00,482
I always hoped to see you well-fixed...

395
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:04,928
have me a crop of grandkids
to fuss around with.

396
00:38:06,413 --> 00:38:08,563
I'd like to oblige you, Arletta, but...

397
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:11,930
right off, I just don't know
where to put my hands on them.

398
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:16,251
You know, sometimes...

399
00:38:17,053 --> 00:38:19,613
I wish people was like dogs, Luke.

400
00:38:22,013 --> 00:38:25,323
Comes a time, a day like, when...

401
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:30,251
the bitch just don't recognize
the pups no more, so...

402
00:38:31,613 --> 00:38:36,209
she don't have no hopes,
nor love, to give her pain.

403
00:38:38,893 --> 00:38:40,645
She just don't give a damn.

404
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:47,251
They letting you smoke here?

405
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:49,005
Smoking up here, Boss?

406
00:38:57,053 --> 00:38:59,009
You've done your best, Arletta.

407
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:04,005
What I've done with myself
is my own problem.

408
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:07,768
Oh, no, it ain't, Luke. You ain't alone.

409
00:39:08,293 --> 00:39:10,523
Everywhere you go, I'm with you.

410
00:39:11,653 --> 00:39:12,927
And John, too.

411
00:39:15,613 --> 00:39:18,081
You never thought maybe
that's a heavy load?

412
00:39:20,133 --> 00:39:24,126
Why, we always thought you
were strong enough to carry it.

413
00:39:26,053 --> 00:39:27,327
Was we wrong?

414
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:28,767
I don't know.

415
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:32,772
Well, things are just never the way...

416
00:39:32,853 --> 00:39:34,172
they seem, Arletta, you know that.

417
00:39:34,253 --> 00:39:36,005
A man's gotta go his own way.

418
00:39:36,093 --> 00:39:37,811
Guess, I've just got to...

419
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:41,369
got to love you and let go.

420
00:39:43,573 --> 00:39:44,801
I guess.

421
00:39:47,373 --> 00:39:51,048
I ain't asking what you're going to do
when you get out, because...

422
00:39:51,133 --> 00:39:53,089
I'll be dead and it don't matter.

423
00:39:57,053 --> 00:39:58,850
You never did want to live forever.

424
00:39:58,933 --> 00:40:01,288
I mean, it wasn't such a hell of a life.

425
00:40:02,053 --> 00:40:05,363
I had me some high old times.

426
00:40:06,013 --> 00:40:07,571
Your old man, Luke...

427
00:40:08,013 --> 00:40:11,005
he wasn't much good
for sticking around...

428
00:40:11,093 --> 00:40:13,687
but, damn it, he made me laugh.

429
00:40:16,773 --> 00:40:20,243
I would have liked to have known him,
the way you talk about him.

430
00:40:30,253 --> 00:40:32,084
He'd have broke you up.

431
00:40:44,653 --> 00:40:46,484
- Luke?
- Yeah, Mamma?

432
00:40:48,693 --> 00:40:49,887
What went wrong?

433
00:40:49,973 --> 00:40:52,806
- Nothing. Everything's cool as can be.
- No.

434
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:56,925
Arletta, I tried.

435
00:40:58,173 --> 00:40:59,322
I mean, to...

436
00:41:01,053 --> 00:41:03,965
live always free and above board
like you, but...

437
00:41:04,573 --> 00:41:07,770
I don't know, I just can't seem
to find no elbow room.

438
00:41:11,693 --> 00:41:13,923
You always had good jobs.

439
00:41:15,053 --> 00:41:18,011
And that girl in Kentucky...

440
00:41:18,093 --> 00:41:21,768
Oh. I'd taken a shine to her.

441
00:41:21,853 --> 00:41:25,323
She sure took off
with that convertible fella.

442
00:41:25,413 --> 00:41:26,892
Well, why not?

443
00:41:27,773 --> 00:41:32,369
Idea of marrying got you all,
all bollixed up.

444
00:41:33,733 --> 00:41:36,531
Trying to be respectable.

445
00:41:37,213 --> 00:41:41,126
You was boring the hell out of all of us.

446
00:41:50,493 --> 00:41:52,085
I'm leaving the place to John.

447
00:41:52,173 --> 00:41:53,925
That's good. He earned it.

448
00:41:54,253 --> 00:41:56,084
Ain't nothing to do with it.

449
00:41:59,373 --> 00:42:01,125
I just never give John...

450
00:42:03,293 --> 00:42:06,091
the kind of, you know,
feeling that I give you.

451
00:42:06,173 --> 00:42:09,848
So, I'm going to pay him back now.

452
00:42:11,693 --> 00:42:14,127
Don't feel you have to say anything.

453
00:42:17,213 --> 00:42:19,363
The way it is, you see...

454
00:42:24,373 --> 00:42:28,810
sometimes you just
have a feeling for a child...

455
00:42:30,653 --> 00:42:32,166
or else you don't.

456
00:42:33,613 --> 00:42:35,524
With John, I just didn't.

457
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:43,172
I gotta go, Arletta.

458
00:42:45,053 --> 00:42:47,772
Laugh it up, kid. You, you'll make out.

459
00:42:57,653 --> 00:43:01,487
Uncle Luke, why can't you have chains?

460
00:43:03,293 --> 00:43:05,124
John-Boy, let me tell you something.

461
00:43:05,213 --> 00:43:08,888
You know, them chains ain't medals.
You get them for making mistakes.

462
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:13,532
And you make a bad enough mistake,
then you've got to deal with the Man.

463
00:43:13,693 --> 00:43:15,331
He is one rough old boy.

464
00:43:15,533 --> 00:43:16,648
Okay?

465
00:43:29,613 --> 00:43:31,524
So long, Arletta. Take care.

466
00:43:32,173 --> 00:43:33,526
You know it, kid.

467
00:43:37,893 --> 00:43:40,327
Now there ain't nothing to come back for.

468
00:43:46,653 --> 00:43:51,602
<i>Just a closer walk with Thee</i>

469
00:43:54,493 --> 00:43:59,442
<i>Grant it, Jesus, is my plea</i>

470
00:44:02,173 --> 00:44:07,122
<i>Daily walking close to Thee</i>

471
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:13,601
<i>Let it be, dear Lord</i>

472
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:17,481
<i>Let it be</i>

473
00:44:18,613 --> 00:44:23,562
<i>Through the days of toil that's near</i>

474
00:44:25,653 --> 00:44:30,602
<i>If I fall, dear Lord, who cares?</i>

475
00:44:34,253 --> 00:44:36,721
<i>Who but Thee</i>

476
00:44:36,813 --> 00:44:41,011
<i>My burden shares?</i>

477
00:44:41,093 --> 00:44:44,847
<i>None but Thee, dear Lord</i>

478
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:48,972
<i>None but Thee</i>

479
00:45:08,493 --> 00:45:09,926
All right.

480
00:45:11,573 --> 00:45:13,643
This gang's been doing so good...

481
00:45:14,973 --> 00:45:17,931
the Captain decided
to give you something special.

482
00:45:19,573 --> 00:45:22,883
You've got yourselves
a whole road of tarring to do.

483
00:45:25,053 --> 00:45:26,964
And I want to see you roll it.

484
00:45:32,493 --> 00:45:34,006
Pick up your shovels.

485
00:45:34,493 --> 00:45:36,085
Get with it. Move!

486
00:45:39,453 --> 00:45:41,444
The bear's sure going to be walking
the road today.

487
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:42,727
What's the deal?

488
00:45:42,813 --> 00:45:47,045
Man, you think you been working hard?
This mother's going to break your back.

489
00:46:26,413 --> 00:46:28,643
Let's roll! Let's see those shovels!

490
00:46:30,533 --> 00:46:32,410
All right, roll it!

491
00:46:32,493 --> 00:46:36,964
I'm gonna twist my arm off
if this heat don't kill me first. Right, Boss.

492
00:46:44,813 --> 00:46:47,088
Hey, buddy, slow down.

493
00:46:47,613 --> 00:46:49,251
That's a long road.

494
00:46:51,053 --> 00:46:54,762
Well, the Man wants speed,
let's just give it to him.

495
00:46:55,133 --> 00:46:59,092
Cram it in and break it off. Go hard.

496
00:47:00,773 --> 00:47:02,445
What are we racing for?

497
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:06,331
Wants speed, let's give it to him.

498
00:47:06,893 --> 00:47:09,930
Use that shovel like it was your spoon.
Shag it, man.

499
00:47:23,533 --> 00:47:25,251
The Man, boy, get the Man!

500
00:47:25,373 --> 00:47:27,284
Moving it up here, Boss?

501
00:48:04,493 --> 00:48:07,326
Now you tell me, Rabbitt,
what's going on here?

502
00:48:07,693 --> 00:48:10,924
I don't know, Boss.
I think they're all bear-clawed.

503
00:48:17,453 --> 00:48:20,092
They don't know whether to smile,
spit, or swallow.

504
00:48:20,173 --> 00:48:23,483
Well, they've never seen
a bull gang before.

505
00:49:35,533 --> 00:49:37,012
Where'd the road go?

506
00:49:37,773 --> 00:49:40,571
That's it. That's the end of it.

507
00:49:40,973 --> 00:49:42,804
Man, there's still daylight.

508
00:49:43,053 --> 00:49:44,566
About two hours left.

509
00:49:46,253 --> 00:49:47,652
What do we do now?

510
00:49:48,973 --> 00:49:50,088
Nothing.

511
00:49:50,893 --> 00:49:54,408
Oh, Luke, you wild, beautiful thing!

512
00:49:55,213 --> 00:49:57,443
You crazy handful of nothing!

513
00:50:17,693 --> 00:50:19,968
"As Carol pressed her lips to him...

514
00:50:20,053 --> 00:50:24,171
"his right hand started a slow
descent down her silken body.

515
00:50:24,973 --> 00:50:28,443
"Desire and fear, temptation and terror...

516
00:50:28,853 --> 00:50:32,846
"yearning and horror warred
within her beautiful young body."

517
00:50:35,093 --> 00:50:36,924
They have to close those things,
or we'll drown...

518
00:50:37,013 --> 00:50:39,607
but it sure is suffocating in here.

519
00:50:40,013 --> 00:50:41,492
Talk about drowning.

520
00:50:42,413 --> 00:50:43,892
When I was in the Navy...

521
00:50:43,973 --> 00:50:46,806
I was on submarine duty once,
and when you get down there...

522
00:50:46,893 --> 00:50:50,044
Will you tell your story walking?
It's too hot.

523
00:50:59,693 --> 00:51:01,843
Did you see my skinny little boy
chow tonight?

524
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:04,003
He's matching you plate for plate.

525
00:51:04,173 --> 00:51:07,404
I wasn't feeling good.
I think I got an ulcer or something.

526
00:51:08,493 --> 00:51:11,530
He had a bigger spoon.
Made you look like yours had a hole in it.

527
00:51:11,613 --> 00:51:12,841
Come on, Clarence.

528
00:51:12,933 --> 00:51:15,367
What do you mean, "Clarence"?
You calling me a liar?

529
00:51:15,453 --> 00:51:16,568
No, not a liar.

530
00:51:16,653 --> 00:51:20,407
You just have a common and
likeable tendency toward exaggeration.

531
00:51:22,893 --> 00:51:25,930
That there's the champion hog-gutter
of this camp.

532
00:51:26,733 --> 00:51:29,167
Hell, I've seen him eat
ten chocolate bars...

533
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:31,972
and seven cold drinks in 15 minutes.

534
00:51:32,973 --> 00:51:37,046
He can eat busted bottles and rusty nails,
any damn thing.

535
00:51:37,133 --> 00:51:41,126
If you be so kind to let me cut off
your Yankee head, he'll even eat that.

536
00:51:42,573 --> 00:51:43,972
I can eat 50 eggs.

537
00:51:48,653 --> 00:51:50,166
Nobody can eat 50 eggs.

538
00:51:50,253 --> 00:51:51,766
You just said he could eat anything.

539
00:51:51,853 --> 00:51:53,047
You ever eat 50 eggs?

540
00:51:53,133 --> 00:51:55,124
Nobody ever ate 50 eggs.

541
00:51:55,213 --> 00:51:57,363
Hey, Babalugats! We got a bet here.

542
00:51:57,693 --> 00:52:00,491
My boy says he can eat 50 eggs,
he can eat 50 eggs.

543
00:52:00,573 --> 00:52:02,131
Yeah, but in how long?

544
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:04,402
In an hour.

545
00:52:04,493 --> 00:52:06,643
Well, I believe I'll take part of that wager.

546
00:52:06,733 --> 00:52:08,007
$2. Right here. I'm going to Koko.

547
00:52:08,093 --> 00:52:09,572
Come on now, let's talk some money.

548
00:52:09,653 --> 00:52:11,484
All right, $20. Anything.

549
00:52:11,573 --> 00:52:13,803
The syndicate will cover any kind of bet
you want to make.

550
00:52:13,893 --> 00:52:14,928
Koko, get some paper.

551
00:52:15,013 --> 00:52:18,323
Drag, 50 eggs got to weigh
a good 6 pounds.

552
00:52:18,413 --> 00:52:21,132
Man's gut can't hold that.
They'll swell up and bust him open.

553
00:52:21,213 --> 00:52:22,202
You gonna kill him.

554
00:52:22,293 --> 00:52:25,126
All right, get your money up. Now,
Gambler, Dynamite, come on, get it up.

555
00:52:25,213 --> 00:52:28,205
Coconut-head's going to take all the
money. Come on, Loudmouth, get it up.

556
00:52:28,293 --> 00:52:30,045
Wait just a minute, now.
How's he gonna eat them?

557
00:52:30,133 --> 00:52:32,567
Boiled for 15 minutes.
Eat the whole thing in an hour.

558
00:52:32,653 --> 00:52:35,008
One rule. No throwing up.

559
00:52:35,093 --> 00:52:37,482
He throws up, you forfeit everything.

560
00:52:37,773 --> 00:52:40,571
Now when was the last time
you ever saw my boy throw up?

561
00:52:40,653 --> 00:52:43,087
Now shut your mouth
and give your money to Koko.

562
00:52:43,173 --> 00:52:45,812
Come on, now. Right over here.

563
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:51,562
Luke, what did you have to say 50 for?

564
00:52:51,853 --> 00:52:55,084
Why couldn't you say 35 or 39?

565
00:52:55,173 --> 00:52:57,084
It seemed a nice round number.

566
00:52:57,293 --> 00:53:00,683
That's money you're talking about.
What's the matter with you?

567
00:53:00,813 --> 00:53:04,044
Yeah, well, it'll be something to do.

568
00:53:09,573 --> 00:53:11,643
- Ten!
- Ten, right!

569
00:53:15,173 --> 00:53:16,606
What did I do?

570
00:53:18,573 --> 00:53:20,643
I stole and I told lies.

571
00:53:21,413 --> 00:53:22,641
Keep your left up.

572
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:25,770
- But I love my neighbor.
- And his wife.

573
00:53:26,093 --> 00:53:27,765
He'll never make it.

574
00:53:28,933 --> 00:53:30,161
Wait a second.

575
00:53:30,253 --> 00:53:33,848
What we've got to do is stretch
that little old belly of yours.

576
00:53:33,933 --> 00:53:34,968
Do it, man.

577
00:53:35,053 --> 00:53:38,284
Get all this stuff out of the way
of them eggs coming down.

578
00:53:38,373 --> 00:53:39,522
What do you think?

579
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:43,928
We've got to get it all in fighting shape,
like a barrage balloon.

580
00:53:48,093 --> 00:53:49,606
Ready?

581
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,326
And go!

582
00:54:01,773 --> 00:54:05,482
Hey, Boss, man needs a brown bomber
and a dose of salts.

583
00:54:05,573 --> 00:54:07,882
Nobody said nothing about that.

584
00:54:12,293 --> 00:54:13,772
You can't do that!

585
00:54:16,173 --> 00:54:18,926
- I want my money back.
- No money back.

586
00:54:29,493 --> 00:54:32,087
Twenty of those pills still won't
make any difference. Go ahead.

587
00:54:32,173 --> 00:54:34,050
What are you worried about?
He can't do it.

588
00:54:34,133 --> 00:54:35,248
Do we get our money?

589
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:36,766
What's he doing?

590
00:55:11,173 --> 00:55:13,164
Here comes his eggs.

591
00:55:13,773 --> 00:55:16,924
All right, stand back, you pedestrians.
This ain't no automobile accident.

592
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:18,048
Is that all 50 of them?

593
00:55:18,133 --> 00:55:20,772
Move over, losers.
I got money riding on it.

594
00:55:22,693 --> 00:55:23,921
All right, I've got it figured out.

595
00:55:24,013 --> 00:55:27,289
If he eats an egg a minute,
he's got 10 minutes left to swallow them.

596
00:55:27,373 --> 00:55:30,206
Hey, I was just sent $5 from a rodeo outfit.

597
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:32,204
- What for? Well, you gonna bet it?
- Last bull I fell off of.

598
00:55:32,293 --> 00:55:35,285
- Hey, you're peeling his eggs!
- That's right, Mr. Alibi.

599
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:37,648
He peels his eggs himself.
That's understood.

600
00:55:37,733 --> 00:55:40,372
Now you may be just great
at hanging paper around the big city...

601
00:55:40,453 --> 00:55:41,647
and passing bad checks...

602
00:55:41,733 --> 00:55:43,883
but us country boys
ain't entirely brainless.

603
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:46,851
When it comes to the law,
nothing is understood.

604
00:55:47,053 --> 00:55:49,248
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

605
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:52,131
Who made what law
about peeling the eggs?

606
00:55:52,213 --> 00:55:55,250
I'm his trainer.
I'm the syndicate covering all bets.

607
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:58,052
And I'm his official egg-peeler.
That's the law.

608
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:05,088
Just wait till the hour starts, that's all.

609
00:56:05,173 --> 00:56:07,289
I was banking on the fact
that he had to peel them.

610
00:56:07,373 --> 00:56:08,567
First it was the salt...

611
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:10,772
What's going on?

612
00:56:15,573 --> 00:56:16,892
All right.

613
00:56:20,133 --> 00:56:21,486
You ready, champ?

614
00:56:26,733 --> 00:56:27,848
Ready?

615
00:56:29,533 --> 00:56:30,648
Go!

616
00:56:31,733 --> 00:56:32,722
One...

617
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,088
two...

618
00:56:35,573 --> 00:56:36,847
three...

619
00:56:36,933 --> 00:56:39,970
Man, he's going to lose a finger
eating eggs like that.

620
00:56:47,973 --> 00:56:49,201
Twenty-four...

621
00:56:54,733 --> 00:56:55,768
twenty-five...

622
00:56:55,853 --> 00:56:57,286
Slow down a little.

623
00:57:01,413 --> 00:57:02,846
Twenty-six...

624
00:57:06,213 --> 00:57:07,532
Forget it, he's wasting time.

625
00:57:07,613 --> 00:57:10,002
What's the exercise,
is that part of the rules?

626
00:57:10,853 --> 00:57:12,809
You better forget about it.

627
00:57:25,413 --> 00:57:26,528
Thirty-two.

628
00:57:31,213 --> 00:57:33,249
Still got 18 more to go...

629
00:57:33,373 --> 00:57:34,408
What's wrong?

630
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:36,290
- I think he's gonna throw up!
- Oh, no.

631
00:57:36,373 --> 00:57:37,931
- That's it.
- He's finished.

632
00:57:38,013 --> 00:57:39,765
- Come on, Luke!
- Eighteen to go.

633
00:57:39,853 --> 00:57:40,842
Hey, you'll feel better.

634
00:57:41,853 --> 00:57:43,047
He's finished.

635
00:57:52,133 --> 00:57:54,886
Just like a ripe watermelon
that's about to bust itself open.

636
00:57:54,973 --> 00:57:57,533
Your boy's done for, Drag.
I'm putting in my last penny.

637
00:57:57,613 --> 00:58:01,003
- It don't look good, Drag.
- Man's gut can't hold more than that.

638
00:58:10,373 --> 00:58:13,968
- He's all right, he's all right.
- He's going to make himself sick.

639
00:58:19,013 --> 00:58:21,447
- He's all right.
- Attaboy.

640
00:58:24,053 --> 00:58:27,250
I give you a dollar, he don't eat all 50 eggs,
I get $2 back.

641
00:58:27,333 --> 00:58:29,244
Fixer, you is a sweet old boy.

642
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:33,043
You better take that dollar and buy
yourself a new spark plug or something.

643
00:58:33,133 --> 00:58:35,567
But as long as you done took a stand...

644
00:58:35,653 --> 00:58:38,690
why don't you put some money where
your mouth is and not no measly buck!

645
00:58:38,773 --> 00:58:40,411
Well, all I got is $3.75, Drag.

646
00:58:40,493 --> 00:58:41,721
That's a bet, Koko.

647
00:58:41,813 --> 00:58:45,123
All right, now, the rest of you,
I want to hear from some big-money men.

648
00:58:45,213 --> 00:58:46,771
Where's all the high rollers?

649
00:58:46,853 --> 00:58:51,005
I believe you've got it all, Dragline.
Every cent in camp is riding.

650
00:59:01,053 --> 00:59:02,532
Thirty-three.

651
00:59:04,013 --> 00:59:06,004
- What's the time?
- Come on, baby.

652
00:59:06,413 --> 00:59:08,722
Twenty-four minutes to go.

653
00:59:09,093 --> 00:59:12,927
Just let that little old belly sag
and enjoy itself.

654
00:59:13,773 --> 00:59:15,172
Thirty-nine.

655
00:59:15,453 --> 00:59:17,171
Going down into the cage.

656
00:59:18,133 --> 00:59:20,124
Twenty-four minutes. He'll never make it.

657
00:59:25,333 --> 00:59:26,561
Forty-one.

658
00:59:26,853 --> 00:59:31,369
Stay loose, buddy. Just nine more
between you and everlasting glory.

659
00:59:31,453 --> 00:59:32,602
Is he eating them, Alibi?

660
00:59:32,693 --> 00:59:35,287
He's chewing. Look at that.

661
00:59:35,373 --> 00:59:38,331
They're pigeon eggs, that's all.
Fish eggs, practically.

662
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:39,761
How much more time, Carr?

663
00:59:39,853 --> 00:59:41,571
Six minutes to go, Stevie.

664
00:59:42,613 --> 00:59:44,126
Chew, chew, chew!

665
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:45,282
You're helping him chew now!

666
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,931
I'm not.

667
00:59:48,813 --> 00:59:51,043
- Forty-two.
- He's not spitting them out.

668
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:54,130
Tiny, tiny egg.

669
00:59:59,973 --> 01:00:01,406
Two minutes to time!

670
01:00:09,613 --> 01:00:10,762
Forty-four.

671
01:00:10,853 --> 01:00:13,890
All right, now,
get mad at them damned eggs.

672
01:00:14,093 --> 01:00:15,242
Eat them down, boy.

673
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:16,322
Chew on it.

674
01:00:16,413 --> 01:00:17,528
Gnaw on it.

675
01:00:23,133 --> 01:00:24,361
Thirty seconds.

676
01:00:25,053 --> 01:00:26,486
You got the last one.

677
01:00:26,573 --> 01:00:29,326
Stuff it down in there. Get it in.

678
01:00:29,413 --> 01:00:32,962
That's the last one in there now, baby.
Chew. Chew.

679
01:00:33,133 --> 01:00:35,044
He's got to swallow it all
before the time's up.

680
01:00:35,133 --> 01:00:38,205
Ten, nine, eight...

681
01:00:38,293 --> 01:00:41,171
seven, six, five...

682
01:00:41,773 --> 01:00:44,571
four, three, two...

683
01:00:44,653 --> 01:00:46,928
one, zero!

684
01:00:49,573 --> 01:00:51,848
Hold it! He didn't swallow the last.

685
01:00:51,933 --> 01:00:55,050
You think so? Just take a look here.

686
01:00:55,133 --> 01:00:56,566
Open that mouth.

687
01:01:12,133 --> 01:01:14,044
Nobody can eat 50 eggs.

688
01:01:32,373 --> 01:01:34,250
Snake in the grass here, Boss!

689
01:01:34,333 --> 01:01:35,686
Get it.

690
01:01:35,773 --> 01:01:37,001
Get it!

691
01:01:41,653 --> 01:01:43,166
Pick it up here, Boss?

692
01:01:53,093 --> 01:01:54,162
Hey, Boss?

693
01:01:54,853 --> 01:01:56,525
Forgot your walking stick.

694
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,958
Man, you sure can shoot.

695
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,877
You've gone too far when
you mess with the Man With No Eyes.

696
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,279
You'll be out of here in a little bit.

697
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,510
Why don't you take it a little easy?

698
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,954
All right, everybody in the trucks.

699
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:57,037
Boy, look at him go! Bam! Bam!

700
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,954
Just knock it off, Luke!
You can't talk about him that way.

701
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,716
You still believe in
that big bearded boss up there?

702
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:04,994
You think he's watching us?

703
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,394
Get in here!

704
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,159
Aren't you scared?

705
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,678
Aren't you scared of dying?

706
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,718
Dying? Boy, he can have this
little life anytime he wants to.

707
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,631
You hear that? You hear it?

708
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,871
Come on! You're welcome to it, old timer.

709
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,198
Let me know you're up there. Come on.

710
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,431
Love me, hate me, kill me, anything.
Just let me know it.

711
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,751
Just standing in the rain...

712
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,235
talking to myself.

713
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:42,194
Blind Dick is paying back three
and borrowing five.

714
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,349
Next.

715
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,714
You borrowing or paying back?

716
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,153
Borrowing.

717
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,835
Well, Mr. Cool Hand here is the soft heart
in our loan department.

718
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,158
I just need five, Luke.

719
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,188
I knew you could really eat all them eggs.

720
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,993
Yeah, well, I didn't.

721
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,958
That's my darling Luke.
He grins like a baby...

722
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,909
but he bites like a gator. Next.

723
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,433
I believe I still owe the 30.

724
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,034
I don't suppose you'd care to take a check?

725
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,309
Luke.

726
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:20,829
Sorry.

727
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,919
His mother's dead.

728
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,829
<i>I don't care if it rains or freezes</i>

729
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:39,038
<i>As long as I got my plastic Jesus</i>

730
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:43,511
<i>Sitting on the dashboard of my car</i>

731
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:51,193
<i>Comes in colors pink and pleasant</i>

732
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,795
<i>Glows in the dark 'cause it's iridescent</i>

733
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,749
<i>Take it with you</i>

734
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,759
<i>When you travel far</i>

735
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:08,713
<i>Get yourself a sweet Madonna</i>

736
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:12,156
<i>Dressed in rhinestone sitting on</i>

737
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,715
<i>A pedestal of abalone shell</i>

738
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:24,438
<i>Going 90, I ain't scary</i>

739
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:28,229
<i>'Cause I got the Virgin Mary</i>

740
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,231
<i>Assuring me</i>

741
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,599
<i>That I won't go to hell</i>

742
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,833
<i>Get yourself a sweet Madonna</i>

743
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,798
<i>Dressed in rhinestone sitting on</i>

744
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:50,590
<i>A pedestal of abalone shell</i>

745
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,719
<i>Going 90, I ain't scary</i>

746
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,314
<i>'Cause I got the Virgin Mary</i>

747
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:58,799
<i>Assuring me</i>

748
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,997
<i>That I won't go to hell</i>

749
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,554
Luke, fall out.

750
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,314
When a man's mother dies...

751
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,518
and he gets to thinking about
her funeral and paying respects...

752
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:42,237
before he knows it, his mind ain't right.

753
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,720
He's got rabbit in his blood and he runs.

754
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,394
We're keeping you off the road for a while.

755
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,514
I'm going to say a prayer
for your ma, Luke.

756
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:41,797
Sorry, Luke, I'm just doing my job.
You've got to appreciate that.

757
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,594
Calling it your job
don't make it right, Boss.

758
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,399
Twenty-one.

759
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:58,955
- Twenty-two.
- Twenty-three.

760
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,951
- Twenty-four.
- Twenty-five.

761
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:04,112
- Twenty-six.
- Twenty-seven.

762
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,997
- Twenty-eight.
- Twenty-nine.

763
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,638
- Thirty.
- Thirty-one.

764
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:13,630
- Moving it up here, Boss?
- Move it up.

765
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,194
Four.

766
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:40,989
Five.

767
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:43,673
- Six.
- Seven.

768
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,113
- Eight.
- Nine.

769
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,069
- Ten.
- Eleven.

770
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:48,559
- Twelve.
- Thirteen.

771
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,438
Your ma's in the ground now,
God rest her soul.

772
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,756
You best forget about it, Luke.

773
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,717
Got a day and a half lay-in.
Tomorrow's a holiday.

774
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,714
- Happy Fourth of July!
- Same to you!

775
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,596
Break it up. Come on, you had your fun.

776
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:57,478
First bell! Move it, Stevie.

777
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,789
Hey, Carr. Come here.

778
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,189
What have you got,
another one of them dirty books, Drag?

779
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,955
Do yourself a favor. Read this part
that Koko underlined for me.

780
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:14,877
"She moved her head another inch
while he reached up...

781
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,434
"and put his left hand on Carol's...

782
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,430
"As Carol pressed her..."

783
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,431
Oh, I can't stand it!

784
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,829
You're just coming to
the interesting part now.

785
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,399
Yeah, go ahead.

786
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:43,395
- I can't hear you.
- "Her trembling body...

787
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:46,392
"shivered under his..."

788
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,275
All right!

789
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,639
Last bell. Last bell.

790
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:56,512
- Move it.
- Hey, Carr.

791
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,678
What's that noise outside?

792
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,238
Man on the fence, Boss!

793
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,352
Hit him!

794
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,998
Wait a minute! Damn it!

795
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,588
Blue, come back here! Damn it!

796
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:28,597
Forty-eight, Boss.
One in the box and one in the bush.

797
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:31,917
Forty-eight. One in the box
and one in the bush.

798
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,152
Oh, listen to Blue sing!

799
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:00,716
He's onto him, he says. He's got him.

800
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,677
Hell, that dog's running around in circles.

801
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,159
No, he's onto him.

802
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:07,552
Captain says for us to wait
till the patrol gets here.

803
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:09,358
Should've waited for me to get him out.

804
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,351
Loose like that he can run him crazy.

805
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,477
Didn't even have enough sense
to run from the road like everybody else.

806
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:17,233
Oh, I'm beat. This ain't my job nohow.

807
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:15,958
Your dogs are crazy.

808
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,519
He's crossed it.

809
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,433
He's smarter than I thought. Let's go!

810
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,359
He made it!

811
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:56,949
Look, Captain!

812
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,758
Look what he done to Blue.

813
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:01,989
He's dead.

814
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,951
He run himself plumb to death.

815
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,078
Mr. Hunnicutt.

816
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,870
Get in line facing the Captain.

817
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:27,594
You're going to get used to wearing
them chains after a while, Luke...

818
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:30,592
but you'll never stop listening
to them clinking.

819
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:34,996
'Cause they're going to remind you
of what I've been saying...

820
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,633
for your own good.

821
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,800
Wish you'd stop being so good
to me, Captain.

822
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:47,154
Don't you ever talk that way to me.

823
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:48,995
Never!

824
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,354
Never!

825
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,600
What we've got here is...

826
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:02,795
failure to communicate.

827
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:07,030
Some men you just can't reach.

828
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:12,111
So you get what we had here last week,
which is the way he wants it.

829
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,238
Well, he gets it.

830
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:20,309
I don't like it anymore than you men.

831
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,075
Well, lookie here.

832
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,558
I knew they'd get you.

833
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,797
Them chains and a bonus
of a couple of years...

834
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:38,599
Your running days are over forever, boy.

835
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:41,634
Hell, I'd like to see you try to run again.

836
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:45,795
You know, you getting so you smell
so bad, I can track you myself.

837
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,636
Yeah, well, that ought to be easy
for a genuine son of a bitch.

838
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,078
Tell us what happened.
How far did you get?

839
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,798
Shut up and let him eat.

840
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,838
About a mile and a half.

841
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:11,873
This supermarket parking lot.

842
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:14,110
Found a car with keys in the ignition.

843
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:17,431
Hit this red light and this police car
slides up alongside.

844
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,513
Then what did you do?

845
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,191
Waited for that light to change.

846
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,352
This cop kept looking over, wondering
what somebody that looks like me...

847
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:31,876
dressed in state issue,
was doing driving a shiny new buggy.

848
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,512
So what did he do?

849
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,400
He leaned over and said, "Hey!"

850
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,710
Topflight police work,
that's all there is to it.

851
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:44,030
Fella's probably a lieutenant by now.

852
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,593
Now, we're just gonna lay low
and build time.

853
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:56,599
Before you know it,
the heat's going to be off of you.

854
01:21:56,680 --> 01:22:00,150
Everything will be right back where it was.
Right, sweet buddy?

855
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,914
I hear tell you don't believe
in no God, Luke.

856
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:18,638
I was wondering how come a nice,
clean-cut young fellow like you...

857
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:20,836
gets to be put on the hard road.

858
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,433
Now I reckon I knows.

859
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:28,588
I've been on the road gang
almost 22 years.

860
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:32,238
In all that time,
I ain't never killed no white man...

861
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:35,071
but I ain't afraid to because...

862
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:38,152
Excuse me, Boss, don't mean to interrupt.
Caught short here.

863
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:40,276
It's all right. It's okay.

864
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:43,388
You just go on out there
behind them trees.

865
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,189
A man's gotta have his privacy sometime.

866
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:49,911
You just keep shaking that bush
so we know you're there.

867
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,911
Just keep shaking that bush.

868
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:53,479
Yes, Boss.

869
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,395
Shaking it up here, Boss!

870
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,231
Still shaking it, Boss.

871
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,038
I'm shaking it, Boss.

872
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:52,789
Damn!

873
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,872
He's gone. Get the dogs.

874
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,638
What you got them on for?

875
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:56,870
How do you take your pants off?

876
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,599
Best way is to get rid of them leg irons...

877
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:02,754
but you ain't strong enough.

878
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:04,478
Strong enough for what?

879
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:07,839
Hell, you couldn't heft an axe.

880
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,148
Can, too.

881
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:10,275
- I bet you can't.
- Can, too.

882
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:12,032
- Bet you can't.
- Can, too.

883
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:16,476
Well, then go get it, man.

884
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:23,475
What's your name, boy?

885
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:24,549
Ben.

886
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:28,872
Aren't you going to take
those stripes off your pants?

887
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:30,953
You know it, kid.

888
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,236
- You want to see something real funny?
- Yeah?

889
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:49,390
Well, you go on in there and you get me...

890
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:52,677
chili powder, pepper, curry and the like.
A lot of it, all right?

891
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:13,070
You'd better let me handle that, son.

892
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:45,954
Here they are.

893
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:47,709
Thank you, son.

894
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,552
What's the matter with him?

895
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:51,153
He'll be all right.

896
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:57,278
Hey, boy.

897
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:00,233
Now listen. You're going to have
some fun. You hear that?

898
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,959
Well, you remember how them dogs do
when they come through here...

899
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:05,600
so you can tell me
about it someday, okay?

900
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:19,355
My wife hasn't written me for a month.

901
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:23,472
She's probably sick again.

902
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:29,274
Drag...

903
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,718
magazine for you.

904
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:35,757
- Carr, you got anything?
- Magazines.

905
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,832
Hey, Koko, who's sending me magazines?

906
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,078
Don't know. It's from Atlanta.

907
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:44,434
My uncle!

908
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:48,754
Ain't heard from him in eight years
and now he's sending me magazines!

909
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:51,152
He must have gone crazy!

910
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:56,994
Look at that!

911
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:59,429
- That's Luke?
- Look at that, two of them.

912
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,678
What's the writing say?

913
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:06,111
What's that writing say?

914
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:09,510
"Dear boys: Playing it cool. Luke."

915
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:11,679
Let me take a look. Come here.

916
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,273
Hey, pass it around.

917
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:17,311
They must be 6 feet tall.

918
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:22,559
Give it back there.

919
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,234
Look at that!

920
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:27,470
My baby! We're in here
digging and dying...

921
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:29,915
he's out there living and flying.

922
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:58,712
Koko, will you stop that?

923
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:01,151
Why don't you try making me?

924
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,549
- Hey, Drag? Let me see the picture.
- What for?

925
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:17,631
Come on, Drag, let us see the picture.

926
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:19,711
No, you're just a kid.
What you know about it?

927
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,109
You don't want to see that dirty picture.

928
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,555
Luke and them broads and all that booze.

929
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,709
Come on, let me take a look.

930
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:28,268
It would go to your coconut head.
You're liable to get ideas...

931
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:29,395
and pass right out.

932
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:30,754
Come on, Drag, be a buddy.

933
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:34,037
Now, what you figure it's worth?
A peek at that there picture?

934
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:36,509
A quick look now.
I'm not talking about no memorizing job.

935
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:37,715
Cold drink.

936
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:40,190
A cold... One cold drink...

937
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:43,636
to feast your starving, fishy,
little eyes on the picture?

938
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,916
A true vision of paradise itself...

939
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,595
with two of the angels right there
frisking around with my boy?

940
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,313
Okay, it's a deal.

941
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,436
One cold drink, in advance.

942
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:10,271
One chilly bottle
right in my hot little hand.

943
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:13,079
That goes for the rest
of you mullet-heads, too.

944
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:14,839
Let me see.

945
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:16,273
Did you pay?

946
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:21,997
Coming in there, Wickerman.

947
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:53,234
You run one time,
you get yourself a set of chains.

948
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:56,633
You run twice, you get yourself two sets.

949
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:58,958
You ain't going to need no third set...

950
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:01,679
because you're going to get
your mind right.

951
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:04,310
And I mean "right."

952
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:07,871
Take a good look at Luke.

953
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:11,428
Cool Hand Luke.

954
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:22,551
- Easy, easy!
- Let him breathe!

955
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:27,150
Oh, my poor baby.
They done you real good.

956
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:29,549
I don't know if you're going
to have them girls chasing you.

957
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:30,789
I'll get some aspirin.

958
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,950
- He should have a doctor.
- Ain't you ever gonna learn?

959
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,996
They ain't gonna let no doctor see
what they've done.

960
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:36,399
Some ice should take that swelling down.

961
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:39,552
Get your razor. We'll clean up
some of these cuts on his head.

962
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:41,790
How you feeling, buddy? How you feeling?

963
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:43,313
Maybe he can't hear you.

964
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:46,039
Somebody ought to give him
something cold to drink.

965
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:48,873
- That's my baby.
- Now he's going to be all right.

966
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:53,431
Hey, Luke, look, we got the picture
you sent us. Look there.

967
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,956
You really can pick them, Luke.

968
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:02,600
Come on, tell us. What were they like?

969
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:04,477
Can't you wait until he stops bleeding?

970
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:07,233
- Why don't you go back to your knitting?
- Knock it off, you guys.

971
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:09,470
Picture's a phony. Cost me a week's pay.

972
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:11,073
What do you mean, a phony?

973
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:12,195
What you talking about, man?

974
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:14,635
We see them two women
right here in the picture.

975
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:16,836
Did you have them both at once?
I mean, together?

976
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:20,117
Picture's a phony.
I had it made up for you guys.

977
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:22,435
What do you mean? We saw it all!

978
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:23,635
You was having a big time, man.

979
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:24,835
You had it made!

980
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:27,309
Nothing. Made nothing, had nothing.

981
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,910
Couple of towns, couple of bosses.

982
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:32,669
I laughed out loud once, he turned me in.

983
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:33,749
But I got it here!

984
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:37,628
Oh, come on! Stop beating it!

985
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:40,158
Get out there yourselves!

986
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:44,949
Stop feeding off me! Get out of here!

987
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:47,310
Can't breathe. Give me some air!

988
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:55,597
Well, he ain't himself, can't you see that?

989
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:58,478
He's all beat up.
He don't know what he's saying.

990
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:01,790
All right, come on, break it up.

991
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:03,273
Now, straighten out that bench.

992
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:26,319
You was eyeballing.

993
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:29,392
Can't get your mind on them weeds
if you're eyeballing.

994
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:32,040
You don't need reasons to kick me, Boss.

995
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:39,912
First bell. Move it.

996
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:45,949
He'll never make it.

997
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:47,792
What are you talking about?

998
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:02,149
That old box will collapse and fall apart
before Luke calls it quits.

999
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:04,356
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.

1000
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:06,510
Well, I don't see no sign of guts in you.

1001
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:09,319
No. No chains, either.

1002
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:11,595
Big deal paperhanger,
passing two-bit checks.

1003
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:15,070
You haven't had much luck playing
follow-the-leader, have you?

1004
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:20,190
All right! Last bell!

1005
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:23,114
You want to spend the night
in the box, too?

1006
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:31,398
Well, here's our champion hog-gut.
Ain't ate for four days.

1007
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:34,472
You're going to need a little extra.
Got plenty for you.

1008
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:35,788
Now you know the rules.

1009
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:38,269
Got to clean your plate
or go back in the box. Right, Boss?

1010
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:39,554
That's enough, Dog Boy.

1011
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:41,710
Oh, man used to free-world food
has got a big appetite.

1012
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:44,633
We're going to stretch that
hog-belly right out, huh?

1013
01:36:58,960 --> 01:36:59,949
One.

1014
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:02,792
- Two.
- Three.

1015
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:04,871
- Four.
- Five.

1016
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,439
- Six.
- Seven.

1017
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:08,556
Well, you made the week, boy.

1018
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:12,550
Now you got a day-and-a-half
to rest up for old Monday.

1019
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,115
Luke!

1020
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:43,309
That ditch is Boss Keen's ditch.

1021
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:46,349
I told him that dirt in it is your dirt.

1022
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,150
What's your dirt doing in his ditch?

1023
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:51,793
I don't know, Boss.

1024
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:55,160
You better get in there and get it out, boy.

1025
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:11,711
<i>Well, you wake up in the morning</i>

1026
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:13,950
<i>Hear the ding dong ring</i>

1027
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:15,678
<i>You go a-marching to the table</i>

1028
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:17,951
<i>See the same damn thing</i>

1029
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:19,758
<i>Well, it's on the table</i>

1030
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,116
<i>A knife, a fork and a pan</i>

1031
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:23,758
<i>Say anything about it</i>

1032
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,991
<i>You get in trouble with the man</i>

1033
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:27,877
<i>You get in trouble with the man</i>

1034
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:29,678
<i>Let the midnight special</i>

1035
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:31,878
<i>Shine a light on me</i>

1036
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:33,917
<i>Let the midnight special</i>

1037
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:36,640
<i>Shine her ever-loving light on me</i>

1038
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:39,598
<i>If you ever go to Houston</i>

1039
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:41,313
<i>Boy, you better walk right</i>

1040
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:43,834
<i>And you better not stagger</i>

1041
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:45,876
<i>And you better not fight</i>

1042
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:48,190
<i>'Cause the sheriff's gonna arrest you</i>

1043
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:50,510
Luke, what do you think you're doing?

1044
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:55,672
Just getting my dirt
out of Boss Keen's ditch, Boss.

1045
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:58,758
I'll be damned if you're going
to put your dirt in my yard.

1046
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:00,592
You hear me?

1047
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:02,557
Now let's get it out of there.

1048
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:06,031
<i>If you ever go to Houston</i>

1049
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:08,076
<i>Boy, you better walk right</i>

1050
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,957
<i>And you better not stagger</i>

1051
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:12,156
<i>And you better not fight</i>

1052
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:13,832
<i>'Cause the sheriff's gonna arrest you</i>

1053
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:15,831
<i>They're gonna take you down</i>

1054
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:17,956
<i>Say anything about it</i>

1055
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:20,190
<i>You're penitentiary-bound</i>

1056
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:21,952
<i>Let the midnight special</i>

1057
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:23,951
<i>Shine a light on me</i>

1058
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:47,236
I told you to get your dirt out
of Boss Keen's ditch, didn't I?

1059
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:51,715
Yeah, Boss.

1060
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,831
Then how come it ain't out?

1061
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:01,872
I don't know, Boss.

1062
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:03,792
You don't know.

1063
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:28,112
<i>Ain't no grave</i>

1064
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:31,397
<i>Gonna keep my body down</i>

1065
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:34,350
<i>Ain't no grave</i>

1066
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:37,558
<i>Gonna hold my body down</i>

1067
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:43,713
<i>Keep your mind on me above</i>

1068
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:46,997
<i>Keep your heart full of love</i>

1069
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:50,034
<i>Ain't no grave</i>

1070
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:53,476
<i>Gonna hold my body down</i>

1071
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:56,595
<i>Ain't no grave</i>

1072
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:59,717
<i>Gonna hold my body down</i>

1073
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:32,796
What's all this dirt doing in here?

1074
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,431
I don't know.

1075
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:54,076
<i>When I was a little bitty baby</i>

1076
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:56,674
<i>My mamma used to rock me in my cradle</i>

1077
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:00,116
<i>In them old cotton fields back home</i>

1078
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:03,070
<i>It was down in Louisiana</i>

1079
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:04,559
Don't, Boss.

1080
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:05,959
Get to work.

1081
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:08,990
Don't, Boss. Don't hit me anymore.

1082
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:14,075
For God's sake, don't hit me anymore.

1083
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:18,478
What was that you said?
What was that name you used, Luke?

1084
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:21,148
Oh, God!

1085
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:24,388
Oh, God!

1086
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:32,153
Oh, God, I pray to God
you don't hit me anymore.

1087
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,197
I'll do anything you say,
but I can't take anymore.

1088
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:41,793
- You got your mind right, Luke?
- Yeah...

1089
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,399
I got it right.

1090
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:50,596
Oh, I got it right, Boss.

1091
01:42:58,040 --> 01:42:59,951
Suppose you was to backslide on us?

1092
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:01,951
Oh, no, I won't, Boss.

1093
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:04,750
Suppose you was to back-sass?

1094
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:07,719
Oh, no, I won't. I won't.
I got my mind right.

1095
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:17,949
You try to run again,
we're going to kill you.

1096
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:19,678
I won't, I won't, Boss.

1097
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:30,032
Go get cleaned up and get yourself
some sleep. Suspect you need it.

1098
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:33,714
Come on, son.

1099
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:37,118
Come on up out of there.

1100
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:12,191
Coming in, Boss.

1101
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:39,359
I got my mind right.

1102
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:15,234
Where are you?

1103
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:18,558
Where are you now?

1104
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:07,428
- All right. Smoke it up.
- Yes, sir.

1105
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:11,314
Luke, water them down.

1106
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:13,628
Yes, Boss.

1107
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:36,751
Luke! Fetch the rifle.

1108
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:27,031
You got him, Boss. You got him.

1109
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:28,879
Go fetch it, Luke.

1110
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:51,592
There he is, Boss.
Deader than hell, but won't let go.

1111
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:03,914
You cut that up for our lunch, Luke.

1112
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:06,592
Yes, sir, Boss Paul.

1113
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:53,549
He took the keys off of Dog Boy's truck.

1114
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:56,392
He got the keys here, too.

1115
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:14,997
"I'm shaking it here, Boss. I'm shaking it."

1116
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:22,512
That's my baby, Luke.

1117
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:28,917
"Don't hit me, Boss. Don't hit me.

1118
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:33,555
"I'll do whatever you say.
Only don't hit me."

1119
01:49:33,640 --> 01:49:36,154
You are an original, that's what you are.

1120
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:38,800
Those mullet-heads didn't even know
you were fooling them.

1121
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:43,876
Fooling them? You can't fool them
about something like that.

1122
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:45,154
They broke me.

1123
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:49,717
But they didn't get my mind right.
Not with no stick. No, sir.

1124
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:53,518
All that time you were planning
on running again.

1125
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:56,314
I've never planned anything in my life.

1126
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:24,358
That's just a little old farm road.
Clean as a whistle.

1127
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:27,989
I worked it a couple times.
We're home free. Come on.

1128
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:29,308
We ain't going nowhere.

1129
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:31,311
Now, what are you talking about, Luke?

1130
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:34,119
We're going by my house
and we're going to have a big meal.

1131
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:38,557
Then, I'm going to show you a couple of
farm girls that really knows what fun...

1132
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:41,471
And then we're going to get Koko
out of there.

1133
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:44,120
And then the terrible trio
going to be complete again.

1134
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:47,829
Man, this old free world
ain't going to know which ear to stand on.

1135
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:51,511
Yeah, well, you and Koko
can handle it without me.

1136
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:54,391
What you mean, Luke?

1137
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:56,831
I've done enough world-shaking
for a while.

1138
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:59,957
You do the rest of it for me.
Send me a postcard about it.

1139
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:01,951
- But, Luke...
- Take it easy, Drag.

1140
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:03,871
Where are you going?

1141
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:05,154
Just on my own.

1142
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:09,318
But what am I going to do, all by myself?

1143
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:15,075
Man, if I hadn't lost my head.
I only had a couple of years to do.

1144
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:19,157
But when I saw you tearing down the road
in that truck...

1145
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:23,872
Well, you're right, Luke.

1146
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:26,672
We ought to split up.

1147
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:31,632
And then, and then it will be safer
for the both of us.

1148
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:39,270
Just the same,
you're a good old boy, Luke.

1149
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:43,394
You take care!

1150
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:47,952
You hear?

1151
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:39,514
Anybody here?

1152
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:56,391
Hey, old man. You home tonight?

1153
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:04,716
Can you spare a minute?
It's about time we had a little talk.

1154
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:10,710
I know I'm a pretty evil fellow...

1155
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:14,755
killed people in the war and got drunk...

1156
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:17,435
and chewed up municipal property
and the like.

1157
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:19,431
I know I got no call to ask for much...

1158
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:23,832
but even so, you've got to admit,
you ain't dealt me no cards in a long time.

1159
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:29,033
It's beginning to look like you got
things fixed so I can't never win out.

1160
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,956
Inside, outside, all of them...

1161
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:36,031
rules and regulations and bosses.

1162
01:53:36,120 --> 01:53:37,872
You made me like I am.

1163
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:40,669
Now just where am I supposed to fit in?

1164
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:46,079
Old man, I gotta tell you.

1165
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:50,029
I started out pretty strong and fast...

1166
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:56,676
but it's beginning to get to me.

1167
01:53:58,840 --> 01:54:00,193
When does it end?

1168
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:03,876
What do you got in mind for me?

1169
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:05,953
What do I do now?

1170
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:11,719
All right.

1171
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:21,913
On my knees, asking.

1172
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:35,911
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1173
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:40,315
I guess I'm pretty tough to deal with, huh?

1174
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:42,833
A hard case.

1175
01:54:46,240 --> 01:54:47,878
I guess I gotta find my own way.

1176
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:01,669
Luke!

1177
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:13,837
Is that your answer, old man?

1178
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,991
I guess you're a hard case, too.

1179
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:24,951
Luke, you all right?

1180
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:30,834
They got us, boy. They're out there,
thicker than flies.

1181
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:33,430
Bosses, dogs, sheriffs...

1182
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:36,557
more guns than I've ever seen in my life.
You ain't got a chance.

1183
01:55:36,640 --> 01:55:39,279
They caught up with me
right after we split up.

1184
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:43,276
And they was aiming to kill you.
But I fixed that.

1185
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:46,877
I got them to promise
if you give up peaceful...

1186
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:50,239
they ain't even going
to whip you this time.

1187
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:53,715
They're even going to give us
our same bunks back?

1188
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:56,272
Sure, why not?

1189
01:55:56,360 --> 01:56:00,353
We've only been gone a couple of hours.
They're reasonable men.

1190
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:06,079
Yeah, well.

1191
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:10,872
You've got to listen to me.

1192
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:15,357
All you've got to do is give up...

1193
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:17,159
nice and quiet.

1194
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:20,312
Just play it cool.

1195
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:24,638
Yeah, like I always do?

1196
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:27,356
Yeah, just play it...

1197
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:34,832
What're you doing?

1198
01:56:54,160 --> 01:56:57,789
"What we got here
is a failure to communicate."

1199
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:40,835
Go get him.

1200
01:58:16,280 --> 01:58:19,636
You hang on in there, Luke. You hang on.

1201
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:24,199
There's going to be
some world-shaking, Luke.

1202
01:58:25,400 --> 01:58:27,516
We're going to send you a postcard.

1203
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:31,439
You follow me and I'll radio
the emergency clinic to open up.

1204
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:33,670
I'm taking him to the prison hospital.

1205
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:35,432
But that's an hour away. He won't make it.

1206
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:37,988
Get out of the way. He's ours.

1207
01:59:21,240 --> 01:59:23,356
They took him right down that road.

1208
01:59:23,480 --> 01:59:26,074
- What'd he look like, Drag?
- Yeah, Drag, what did he look like?

1209
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:28,230
Did he have his eyes open or closed?

1210
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:30,754
- He was smiling.
- Smiling?

1211
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:37,269
<i>That's right. You know,</i>
<i>that Luke smile of his?</i>

1212
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:39,948
<i>He had it on his face right to the very end.</i>

1213
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:41,388
<i>Hell, if they didn't know it before...</i>

1214
01:59:41,480 --> 01:59:45,314
<i>they could tell right then</i>
<i>that they weren't ever going to beat him.</i>

1215
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:47,591
<i>That old Luke smile.</i>

1216
01:59:49,640 --> 01:59:54,509
<i>Oh, Luke. He was some boy.</i>
<i>Cool Hand Luke, hell!</i>

1217
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:57,710
<i>He's a natural born world-shaker!</i>

1218
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:19,795
English
