1
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,720
Five...

2
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,080
nine, ten, eleven...

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,040
twelve, thirteen,
nineteen, seventeen...

4
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,040
- Arnie...
- fifteen, seventeen.
- Arnie, eat some chicken.

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,680
I don't...
I don't want any chicken, Gilbert.

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,720
You want some corn?

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,920
- I want... I want some corn.
- Have some corn.

8
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,520
Yeah, here.

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,240
- Good?
- Mm-mmm.

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,320
Not good corn.

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,560
- Gilbert?
- Hmm?

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,160
Are they gonna come soon?

13
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,440
'Cause I gotta go back home,
you know?

14
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,760
- Pretty soon.
- I want them to come.

15
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,240
- You wanna go home?
- No.

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,600
I wanna see 'em.

17
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,600
Okay.

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,680
They're gonna come soon, huh?

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,880
How many more miles
till they come, Gilbert?

20
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,200
- Three million, buddy.
- Three?
- Yep.

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,240
Okay.

22
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,560
Gilbert! That's them, huh?
Gilbert, look, it's them!

23
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,080
Look! Look over there!

24
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,400
Over there!

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,280
Look at them, Gilbert!
They're coming!

26
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,480
Honk your horn!
Honk your horn!

27
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,040
- Arnie, get back here!
- Honk your horn!

28
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,480
- My brother Arnie's about to turn 18.
- Arnie!

29
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,880
- My family's planning
a big party for him.
- Arnie, come on!

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,560
Watching the campers
is our yearly ritual.

31
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,600
They're doing the right thing
just passing through.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,360
God, Arnie. You're gettin' so big.
Pretty soon...

33
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,280
- I ain't gonna be able
to carry you no more.
- No.

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,200
- You know,
you're getting littler, Gilbert.
- Yeah.

35
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,120
You're getting littler.
You're shrinking.

36
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,400
You're shrinking, Gilbert.
You're shrinking.

37
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,000
Shrinking, shrinking, shrinking!

38
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,560
Endora.

39
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,360
Endora's where we are.

40
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,840
Describing Endora
is like dancing to no music.

41
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,000
It's a town where
nothing much ever happens...

42
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,520
and nothing much ever will.

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,440
Lamson's Grocery is where I work.

44
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,360
And miles out of town on the interstate,
there's Foodland...

45
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,120
where everyone else shops.

46
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,120
This is where I live with my family.
My dad built the house...

47
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
and it's my job
to keep up the repairs.

48
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,040
Doctors said we'd be lucky
if Arnie lived to be ten.

49
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,800
Well, ten came and went.
Now the doctors are saying...

50
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,720
"Any time now.
Arnie can go at any time."

51
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,240
Some days you want him to live...

52
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,280
some days you don't.

53
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,880
- What is it, buddy?
- I killed him.

54
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,440
- I killed him, Gilbert.
- I know.
- I killed him.

55
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,280
I know, buddy.
I know.

56
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,680
My older sister Amy's
more like a mother.

57
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,000
She used to manage the elementary
school cafeteria over in Motley...

58
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,080
until it burned down last year.

59
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,680
My other sister, Ellen,
just turned 15.

60
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,440
She got her braces off,
and for days now she's been
walking around going, "Ooh. Ahh."

61
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,600
Like she can't believe
the feel of teeth.

62
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,440
I got another brother, Larry,
but he got away.

63
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,680
And then there's Mama,
who in her day...

64
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,200
was the prettiest girl
in these parts.

65
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,280
Ever since our dad
was hung out to dry 17 years ago...

66
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,160
Mama's had her hands full.

67
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,720
You see, with Mama there's
no nice way to break it to you.

68
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,880
She hasn't left the house
in over seven years.

69
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,200
- I'm Gilbert.
- Amy, I need your help.
- What is it?

70
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,000
- Gilbert Grape.
- The garbage.

71
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,800
- "This is the stuff of the circus."
- Sunshine? Where's my sunshine?

72
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,840
I don't know, Mama.

73
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,640
- Just the essentials.
- Okay.

74
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,000
Gilbert, get him down from there.

75
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,760
- Arnie?
- Hurry.
- Let's go.

76
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,840
- Amy, have you seen Arnie?
- No.

77
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,960
- I thought he was with you.
- No. No.

78
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,720
- I wonder where he is.
- Gee, I don't know.

79
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,320
Ellen, have you seen your brother?

80
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,640
- He's in the tree.
- Ellen!

81
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,040
He is not in the tree.
Gilbert already looked in the tree.

82
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,000
Isn't that right, Gilbert?

83
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,640
Yeah, that's right.

84
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,000
Whoa! Arnie.
Don't do that.

85
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,360
Don't do that. You scared me.
Come here.

86
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,640
- Wait, wait. I was up there, Gilbert!
- Yeah, you were up in the tree.

87
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,840
I was right up there.

88
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,480
Can I help you with anything?

89
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,320
- No.
- Thank you, and goodbye.

90
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,920
- Gilbert?
- Sir?

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,760
- Is something goin' on at Foodland?
- Well, I wouldn't know, sir.

92
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,960
I don't shop there.
I'd rather die.

93
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,080
I'll tell you, Foodland's
up to something if you ask me.

94
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,360
It's those lobsters, isn't it?

95
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,320
Scads of lobsters all in a tank.

96
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,600
Am I right?

97
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,280
You know,
you shouldn't worry about it.

98
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,920
It's just a phase.
People will come back here, believe me.

99
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,320
- You think?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

100
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,680
The way you say that makes me think
I'm talking to your father.

101
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,240
- Can I have these two, Gilbert?
- No, just one.
- Come on.

102
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,240
- Can I have these two?
- Sure, go ahead.

103
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,160
Say "Thank you."

104
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,440
- Say hello to Mama for me.
- All righty. See you tomorrow.

105
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,960
Gilbert? That was Mrs Carver
needing a delivery.

106
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,720
Could you?

107
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,720
- Hello, Gilbert.
- Hello.

108
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,400
- Boys, go on outside.
- But we don't want to.

109
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,200
- Yeah, we don't want to.
- Go play.

110
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,520
Okay.

111
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,120
Hey! Hey!

112
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,040
Arnie, get back in the truck.
Keep countin', okay?

113
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,040
Okay. I was counting.

114
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,120
Five, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen...

115
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,800
Hey, kids, let's play!
Come on! Look!

116
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,760
We got the trampoline.
Come on, boys. It's fun!

117
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,400
The, uh...
The ice cream's gonna melt...

118
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,040
soon.

119
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,440
You're right.
It is melting.

120
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,320
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

121
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,440
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my!

122
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,560
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my God.

123
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,440
- Come on up here. I wanna show you.
- I don't wanna do it.
- I don't either.

124
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,560
- You don't wanna do it?
- I want a pool.

125
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,720
- You want a pool?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we want a pool.

126
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,480
Come on. Come on up here.
Up, up, up, up, up, up.

127
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,440
Gilbert was just making a delivery.

128
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,560
Oh. Oh.

129
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,880
Gilbert, come here for a second.

130
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,600
- Here.
- Oh, no, no, no, no. Really, uh...

131
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,280
Oh, no. No, no, here.
I insist. You deserve it.

132
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,520
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

133
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,520
- Bye, Gilbert.
- Bye.

134
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,120
Gilbert?

135
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,360
Come by my office.
We need to talk.

136
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,640
Okay.

137
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,200
Arnie?

138
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,360
<i>Okay, son, it's a little dangerous
up there. Come on down.</i>

139
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,440
<i>- Arnie, get down!
- "Come on, son."
We've had enough fun for one day.</i>

140
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,760
- "Come on down."
- Hey!

141
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,560
Hey! Hey!

142
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,920
Wanna go up there!

143
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,880
- "Son?"
- Yeah?

144
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,880
- "Come on down."
- No!

145
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,120
I'm not coming down!
I'm goin' up there!

146
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,080
<i>Son, come on down.</i>

147
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,160
I'm gonna go up there!

148
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,560
- Arnie? Arnie. Come on down, buddy.
- Look up here.

149
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,480
Hi!

150
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,440
<i>Okay, son.
Come on down.</i>

151
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,960
I'm gonna go up here!

152
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,720
- "Come on, son."
- I'm goin' higher than before!

153
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,120
<i>- I'm goin' high!
- "It's gonna be getting dark soon."
Come on down.</i>

154
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,480
- Hey.
- Hey, Bob. Yeah, look it.
Here we go again.

155
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,640
Basically, I don't like
to work on carburettors...

156
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,760
and I can tell
without gettin' into it...

157
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,000
that that is a complicated unit.

158
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,240
l... Now, I understand. I can do it
myself, but I need the part.

159
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,160
Look, let me show you.

160
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,600
See, it's this
little guy right here.

161
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,880
See, the needle valve
is worn down.

162
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,280
- And I need a new one. Can we order it?
- Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

163
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,120
- I can order it.
- I'm goin' up there!
- About how long

164
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,200
- Probably a week.
- A week?
- "Don't make us come get you."

165
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,280
l... You don't have to come get me!
I'm goin' up here!

166
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,560
<i>Arnie?</i>

167
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,400
Whoa! I'm not gonna fall!
Whoops!

168
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,520
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

169
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,520
Hey!

170
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,680
My shoe done fell off.

171
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,440
My shoe done fell off, Gilbert.

172
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,600
<i>I know a boy
whose name is Arnie</i>

173
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,760
<i>He's about to turn 18
and have a big party</i>

174
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,480
<i>I know a boy
whose name is Arnie</i>

175
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,960
<i>Come on down, buddy.
Come on.</i>

176
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,560
<i>Match in the gas tank
Boom, boom</i>

177
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,120
<i>Match in the gas tank
Boom, boom</i>

178
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,240
<i>Match in the gas tank
Boom, boom</i>

179
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,280
<i>Match in the gas tank
Boom, boom</i>

180
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,600
<i>Boom, boom, boom, boom</i>

181
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,080
<i>Match in the gas tank
Boom, boom</i>

182
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,960
- Good boy.
- Easy does it, now.
- Come on down, buddy.

183
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,800
- All right!
- Come on down.

184
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,080
Come on!

185
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,520
Here we go. All right.
Thanks a lot, Jerry. Really sorry.

186
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,400
Good.
Good boy. Good boy.

187
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,240
I'm gonna take him home.
I promise it won't happen again.

188
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,600
Son, we hear this every time.
Then after a couple of days,
he's right back up there again.

189
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,720
Yeah, but this is the last time.
Right, buddy?

190
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,120
- It's the last time.
- Yeah.

191
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,800
- Come on. Let's go.
- I wanna go back up there again.

192
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,880
Let's go.

193
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,840
- I wanna go up there again.
- Arnie, man, good job.
- Hey.

194
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,360
- Don't touch him.
- Whoa! Nice try!

195
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,440
- Way to go, Arnie.
Could you do it again for me?
- Get out of here.

196
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,360
- Hey, could you help me out later...
- Yeah.
- with the fridge?

197
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,240
- With the what?
- Something wrong with the fridge.

198
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,800
- The electricity?
- I don't know. Maybe.

199
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,120
- All right. I have to get my tools.
- Hi.

200
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,120
I'll see you... I'll just come by later.
Hi. You be careful, all right, Arnie?

201
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Okay.

202
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,400
Don't disappear like that
again on me, okay?

203
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,920
Okay. I disappeared.

204
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,760
I disappeared on Mom like that.

205
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,480
- Please don't disappear.
- Just let him go.

206
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,280
- Gilbert, will you bring the milk?
- I promise, Mama.

207
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,920
- Good boy.
- Disappear like that.
- Good boy.

208
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,160
The food.

209
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,000
- Are we ready to talk about the party?
- Sure.
- I'm ready.

210
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,640
Ellen's in charge of decorations.
Get this... purple, orange and green.

211
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,440
- Sounds good.
- Theme colours, okay?

212
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,360
- That sounds pretty good.
- I'm doing the food, the cake.

213
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,120
Okay.

214
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,280
Arnie, I'm making something
very special for you.

215
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,560
- And Mama,
you can supervise everything.
- Mm-hmm.

216
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,520
- Okay with everybody?
- That's disgusting.
- Sounds good.

217
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,360
What about me?

218
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,600
You are the guest of honour.
How about that?

219
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,640
Gilbert, what about me?
My party! It's my party!

220
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,640
- What about me?
- You just show up, buddy.
That's your job.

221
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,720
- All you have to do is show up.
- You don't have to do anything.

222
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,120
All you have to do is turn 18.

223
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,960
- You know, that just leaves Gilbert.
- Huh?

224
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,640
You're the only one
without anything to do.

225
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,720
- Got any ideas?
- Sure he does.

226
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,520
- No, I don't. No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

227
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,280
- I'm almost 16,
and I've got pages of ideas.
- Ellen...

228
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,520
She designed a whole cake,
and you haven't done anything.

229
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,840
- Stop it, Ellen. Can it.
- Can I be excused?
- He never does anything!

230
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,200
- No!
- Please, can't we just do
something as a family?

231
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,600
- This is no fair, Mom! l...
- Can I please be excused?
- It's my party!

232
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,800
- We're planning this as a family.
- It's my party though!
- Is that too much to ask?

233
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,680
So it's gonna be an exact copy of the
one... the original they built in Boone.

234
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,200
- Really?
- Which is no big deal, Gilbert...

235
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,320
'cause they're all...
all Burger Barns are built identical.

236
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
They're prefabricated.
They just ship 'em out.

237
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,760
I mean, it's so efficient.
It's amazing.

238
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,920
In a matter of a couple days...

239
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,080
there can be
a whole new restaurant there.

240
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,880
So I was driving past
the building site today.

241
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,920
- You know, it's goin' up right next to...
right down the road from Foodland.
- Right.

242
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,600
The general manager was there.
So I says...

243
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,280
"Can I fill out an application?"
He said, "You bet you can."

244
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,400
So I did, you know,
and it looks really good. I mean...

245
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,240
I might be wearin' one of them
uniforms, flippin' some burgers...

246
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,480
saltin' some fries.

247
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,640
You never know. It could be the
best thing that ever happened to me.

248
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,600
- Hey! Get...
- What's the matter?

249
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,960
Get out of here! God!

250
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,600
I saw her!
I saw her, I saw her!

251
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,400
- That wasn't nice.
- What? What did I do?

252
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,280
- You know what you did.
- Oh.

253
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,120
That's your mother in there.

254
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,280
- Your mother.
- I know.

255
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,040
I don't get you, man.
I just don't get it.

256
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,640
- Let's go, buddy.
- Okay.

257
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,120
Come on.

258
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,720
Run, now! Run!

259
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,120
- Hey! Bye-bye, Mama.
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye, you guys.

260
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,040
- Move, honey.
- Gilbert, you're shrinking.

261
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,120
Shrinking, shrinking, shrinking!

262
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,480
I'm not tired yet, Gilbert.

263
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,480
Well, you gotta go to sleep, okay?

264
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,080
Okay. Goodbye.

265
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,920
No, it's not goodbye.
It's good night.

266
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,080
- Yeah.
- Goodbye...

267
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,480
is for when you're going away,
and we're not going anywhere, are we?

268
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,440
I know that.

269
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,640
- Jeez, I know that, Gilbert.
- See you tomorrow.

270
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,760
We're not going anywhere!

271
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,920
- Goodbye!
- Arnie.

272
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,760
- You gotta work later?
- Hi, boys.
- Yeah, I do.

273
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,880
- Hi, Arnie.
- Hi there, ladies.
- I gotta come back.

274
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,120
- How's Mama?
- She's fat.

275
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,200
- Come on, man.
She's not all that big, Gilbert.
- What?

276
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,720
Listen, I saw a guy at the state fair
who was a little bit bigger.

277
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,760
A little bit bigger?

278
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,280
- Look, all I'm saying is she's not
the biggest I've ever seen.
- Tucker, she's a whale.

279
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,360
- Well, take her out for walk
once in a while.
- Tucker, she's a whale!

280
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,400
- Take her out for a jog.
- Get her out of the house.
- Tucker, she's a whale!

281
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,400
- Hey, Bobby.
- Give her a chance.

282
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,760
- That's all I'm sayin'.
- Hi, guys.
- I know.

283
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,200
- How's business?
- Not good. Hey!

284
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,320
Nobody's dying.

285
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,160
There's a clear ladder.
There's a clear corporate ladder.

286
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,000
- I mean, this is not...
- That's good.

287
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,280
That's a good thing for you to do...
to have that happen.

288
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,680
- If you guys would give it a chance...
- l-l...

289
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,080
I just was saying that
it wasn't something that
I should be doing for myself.

290
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,880
Look, they use canola oil, okay?
You know what canola oil is?
You probably don't.

291
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,760
- No.
- They probably don't even sell it
at Lamson's Grocery.

292
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,920
- No.
- It's cutting edge.

293
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,160
- It creates a crispier french fry and...
- Well, that's...

294
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,080
and a more unique product.

295
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,640
And Burger Barn... Forget Wendy's,
forget Burger King, forget McDonald's.

296
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,880
That's, like, old hat.
Burger Barn's cutting edge.

297
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,240
I mean, l-I could really
stand behind it. There's...

298
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,280
It's an innovative place. You know,
they created the salad bar...

299
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,240
which is now mimicked by every
single fast-food chain in America.

300
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,520
- Yeah.
- They came up with that.

301
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,520
Fifteen different toppings
for each salad,
and two different kinds of lettuce.

302
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,040
And it's, you know,
it's all that you care to eat.

303
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,280
- I mean...
- Yeah.

304
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,400
You either go from clerk to fry cook
to cook to assistant manager...

305
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,360
of you can go from clerk
to cashier captain...

306
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,000
to assistant manager.

307
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,040
And then from assistant manager,
you could go to, uh, manager...

308
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,240
and then regional manager
and then...

309
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,680
Look at the little fellas.

310
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,840
You mean my hoppers.

311
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,840
Let's try this.

312
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,960
For my friend.

313
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,960
There you go, my boy.

314
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,720
What do you say, Arnie?

315
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,880
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

316
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,640
Gilbert.

317
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,280
This Thursday.

318
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,400
It's our anniversary.

319
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,560
Okay.

320
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,160
Hello.

321
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,320
Gilbert.

322
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,320
I'll need a delivery later.

323
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,160
Have a nice day.

324
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,880
Gilbert?

325
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,240
Gilbert?

326
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,720
He's behind the chips.

327
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,680
- Delivery, son.
- Excuse me?

328
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,120
Delivery. She's gonna be
needin' some help.

329
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,080
Yes, sir.

330
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,120
- Is that your bike?
- Yes.

331
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,160
I'll do it, Gilbert.
I'll do it.

332
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,880
- Here. Wait a sec.
- I got it!

333
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,160
- I did it, huh?
- Look there.
- I did it by myself.

334
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,800
Yeah. Look at that.

335
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,760
- I could go at any time.
- Shh. Arnie. No.

336
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,000
Any time.

337
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,520
Excuse me. Where to?

338
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,400
Oh, just keep going straight.

339
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,680
All right.

340
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,680
My mom... My mom wants me
to become... become 18.

341
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,120
And I'm having a big...
a big party, huh, Gilbert?

342
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,520
- Yep.
- When is that party coming?
- Six days.

343
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,480
Six days and my party,
and I'm gonna become 18.

344
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,000
- I'm 18, and you're not invited.
- Arnie.

345
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,080
- Don't be rude.
- Oh, it's okay.

346
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,320
He's just being honest.
I don't mind.

347
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,760
- l-I got the groceries!
- All right. Be careful with them.

348
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,440
I got the groceries.
I got 'em, okay?

349
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,040
- Oh.
- Uh-oh, Gilbert.
- No, Arnie.

350
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,520
- Oh, no!
- I'm sorry.

351
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,640
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

352
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,320
- Don't worry about it.
- No, no, I'm really... I'm really sorry.

353
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,880
- This is...
- It's okay.

354
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,360
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

355
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,040
Are you sorry? No.

356
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,560
I'm not sorry. He's not sorry.
We're not sorry.

357
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,840
Don't be sorry.

358
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,240
I'm not sorry.

359
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,280
So I think if we're gonna have
people come that early,
we should have some appetizers.

360
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,360
Ooh, yeah, that'd be good. You know
those little Vienna sausage things?

361
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,600
And you put 'em in grape jelly
and ketchup and make a sauce.

362
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,920
- Well, I was thinking...
- I want hot dogs, Mom.
- How about pretzels?

363
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,360
- You know, like those Hawaiian
appetizers that they make with...
- No.

364
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,280
You get pineapple chunks
out of the can and you wrap them...

365
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,920
with little pieces of bacon
and you put a toothpick through 'em.

366
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,720
- How do you cook the bacon?
- In the oven on a pan.

367
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,880
But the bacon's not gonna be crisp if
you bake it in the oven on a sheet.

368
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,200
- Yes, it will.
- And nobody wants greasy...

369
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,000
- I want hot dogs!
- No, you-you soak 'em...
- floppy bacon.

370
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,520
- Mama, I want hot dogs!
- We're gonna have hot dogs, honey.

371
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,520
- Mama...
- I promise, we're gonna have hot dogs.
- What... I want hot dogs.

372
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,560
- The thing about...
- We're gonna have hot dogs.
- every party that I've been to...

373
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,520
- Ellen.
- is that...
- Ellen?

374
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,560
- Could you not talk
with your mouth full?
- Excuse me?

375
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,320
You're making me sick.
I'm gonna throw up.

376
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,960
- Oh. Okay, Dad.
- Ellen.

377
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,160
- Sure thing, Dad.
- Will you two cut it out?

378
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,520
- Okay, Dad. Sure thing, Dad.
- That's nice.

379
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,840
- Stop it, you guys.
- Don't start.
- Dad's dead, Ellen.

380
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,440
- Gilbert!
- Gilbert!
- I can't believe you said that!

381
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,480
- Shut up!
- Dad's dead!

382
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,320
- Arnie.
- Dad's dead!

383
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,440
- Arnie, shh. Arnie...
- Dad's dead!

384
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,480
- It's okay. Stop it now.
- Oh, God.
- Dad's dead! Dad's dead!

385
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,080
- Arnie, stop it!
- Calm down, Mama. Don't get upset.
- Dad's dead! Dad's dead!

386
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,880
- Make him stop.
- Dad's dead!
- Arnie, shut up!

387
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,320
- Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead!
- You're crazy... You're crazy, Arnie!

388
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,760
- Arnie...
- Stop it.
- Arnie...

389
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,640
- Dad's dead!
- Arnie, listen to me!
- Dad's dead! Dad's dead!

390
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,160
- Dad's dead! Dad's dead!
- Just calm down!
- Stop it!

391
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,840
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Dad's dead!
- That's enough!

392
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,080
- Arnie, that's enough!
- Stop it!
- Dad's dead!

393
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,160
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

394
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,000
- Arnie, be quiet.
- Right now!
- Dad's dead!

395
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,400
I said, stop it right now!

396
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,360
Amy. Amy.

397
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,480
It should be two-by-tens
or two-by-twelves...

398
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,680
and the space
between 'em here is... should...

399
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,560
They're... Right now, it's at two feet,
and this should be 16 inches.

400
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,000
I mean, that's just standard.
And this right here...

401
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,920
See this here? Flat flooring?
I mean, flat flooring's like...

402
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,440
Once the wood gets old, you're
just gonna fall right through it.

403
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,440
Yeah, I guess Daddy wasn't
much of a carpenter.

404
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,520
Hey, Gilbert, why did... why did he use
two-by-sixes instead of two-by...

405
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,960
- Tucker!
- What?

406
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,320
- Shh. Keep it down.
- Sorry.

407
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,240
She's coming.
Hey, she's coming.

408
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,480
- You all right? You okay?
- Yeah.

409
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,960
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Thanks a lot for coming.

410
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,960
- Yeah, I'll come by tomorrow
with the wood.
- Great.

411
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,680
Just... Let's keep it quiet.
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

412
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,720
- What?
- Burger Barn. I'm in.

413
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,400
- I got the call.
- Oh, oh. Good.

414
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,760
It's not too late, you know.
Good night.

415
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,960
<i>- I think she's asleep.
- "Let's say that you wanna"
slice down zucchini squash...</i>

416
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,240
<i>with the electric food dehydrator.
Look at this.</i>

417
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,600
<i>- Wonderful.
- Perfect slices each and every time.</i>

418
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,080
<i>- Is that nice?
- Marvellous.</i>

419
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,720
<i>Of course, if you know someone
that can't chew too well...</i>

420
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,600
<i>- Okay.
- Taking corn off the cob.</i>

421
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,000
<i>Look at this. We'll just turn
the dial down a little bit...</i>

422
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,680
<i>... freezed corn, and sit there
for hours with a knife.</i>

423
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,600
<i>- Literally hours cutting your corn up.
- Unbelievable.</i>

424
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,680
<i>Of course, for un...</i>

425
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,840
- "Right now, you get the..."
- Gilbert, what are you doing?

426
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,280
- Give me that.
- Sorry, Mama.

427
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,360
Jeez.

428
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,200
- Mama?
- Mm-hmm?

429
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,280
I made up that bed for you.

430
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,800
What for?

431
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,920
Well, just in case
you wanted a change.

432
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,880
I'm happy right where I am.

433
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,320
- You sure?
- Yeah.

434
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,720
Here you go.

435
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,560
Here you go, Mama.

436
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,200
Thanks, kids.

437
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,280
- Good night, Mama.
- You're so helpful.

438
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,600
- Another ball!
- I took her delivery,
we talked a little bit.

439
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,600
And that was it.
I dropped her off.

440
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,360
What's she doing here?

441
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,400
She... I don't know.
She's just sort of here.

442
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,640
- I think their car broke down
or something.
- Another ball!

443
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,920
Come on. You... I can see it
in your face that you're...

444
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,320
- Can we just not talk about this now?
Can we just change the subject?
- Why not?

445
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,680
- Do you understand?
- We want a pool.

446
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,640
- Okay. You're tellin' me later.
- I'll tell you everything later.

447
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,560
- Look at those guys out there.
- Gilbert.

448
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,040
They're laughing, they're all happy...

449
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,480
and waving to their friends.

450
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,160
But the next day... and this is
the thing that they don't know...

451
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,000
they could be lying on the slab.

452
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,440
It's kind of, uh, harsh.

453
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
But it's kind of fun too.

454
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,320
- Do you ever, um...
- What?

455
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,920
Well, you know.

456
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,000
- Thank you.
- Are you tempted to, like...

457
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,640
wanna fool around with the bodies?

458
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,960
- Oh, Tucker, come on.
- No, I wanted to ask.
I've always wanted to ask.

459
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,800
- That's all right.
- I'm sorry if
it makes you uncomfortable.

460
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,360
- People are very curious about that.
- Because, I mean
if you don't wanna talk about it...

461
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,920
The worst thing that we do is we take
the bodies... the grotesque ones...

462
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,720
the really, really ugly ones...

463
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,360
and we make... make jokes about them,
you know, harmless jokes.

464
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,200
Very harmless jokes,
but we come up with some...

465
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:07,480
- Come on.
- some very good... good jokes
about them, my father and me.

466
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,480
But-But, you know, they're dead.
And, uh...

467
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,280
- You know, nobody can see that.
Nobody hears anything.
- Hi, boys.

468
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,960
- Hi, Mrs Carver.
- Hello, Mrs Carver.
- Hi.

469
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,800
Those jokes don't hurt anybody.
Nobody knows we even make them.

470
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,720
Gilbert, I'm waiting for your call.

471
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,960
Mr Carver, I haven't seen
your mother in church lately.

472
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,120
- How's she doing?
- Fine. She's fine.

473
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,720
Thanks. Bye.

474
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,000
He wants...
He wants to kill you, right?

475
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,040
Do you prefer a bronze casket?

476
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,800
Hey! Gilbert!

477
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,720
Hey, can somebody give me
a hand down here?

478
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,320
- What?
- Can somebody give me a hand
with the wood?

479
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,240
- Hey, Arnie.
- Huh?

480
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,240
- You wanna go help Tucker?
- Uh-uh.

481
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,920
Arnie, go help Tucker in the basement.

482
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,240
Arnie, why don't you
go into the basement?

483
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,160
- I don't wanna go down there, Gilbert.
- Please?

484
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,000
No way! No way! No way!
You!

485
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,000
- Go down there, Gilbert.
- Is there a problem?

486
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,920
Gilbert? Hey!

487
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,520
Dad's in there!

488
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,200
Dad's in there!

489
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,640
Arnie, shut up!
Arnie!

490
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,280
Shut up! Shut up!

491
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,120
Come on! Arnie.

492
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,800
Arnie!

493
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,760
It's not funny!

494
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,840
Get back here!

495
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,320
Don't worry.
Those are two-by-sixes.

496
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,280
You know, there's six of'em,
so, you know, those could hold anybody.

497
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,000
- l-I forgot.
- What?

498
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,560
I forgot that
that was where your dad...

499
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,480
Yep.

500
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,600
I'm-I'm sorry.

501
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,680
No, that's okay.
Don't worry about it.

502
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,840
- No, Arnie! No! No climbing!
- I wanna go up there!

503
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,320
Arnie! No, you're not!

504
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,200
Arnie! Not again!

505
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,840
- Arnie!
- I wanna go up there!
- Get down. Get down.

506
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,920
Get down!

507
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,800
You're not going anywhere!
Not too much fun, is it?

508
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,040
I wanna go up there!

509
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,080
No! We're going home!

510
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,400
We're going home.
Come on.

511
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,480
- Stop!
- Ellen, no! Stop it!

512
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,720
- Stop it!
- I told you, don't touch him.

513
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,800
- What am I supposed to do?
- Don't ever touch him again.
- He was climbing again!

514
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,400
I don't care. Just get out of here.
Get out of here!

515
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,120
Let me see, buddy.
Come on. Let me see.

516
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,640
Let me see. Oh, great.
You made him bleed!

517
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,400
What does Gilbert say?

518
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,920
If anybody ever hits you...

519
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,040
or even just lays a finger on you,
what are you gonna do?

520
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,440
Arnie?

521
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,520
Hmm?

522
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,600
You're gonna tell me, and then I'm
gonna take care of it for you, right?

523
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,320
And why will I take care of it?

524
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,280
- Gilbert.
- Hmm?

525
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,920
- Because you're Gilbert.
- Because I'm Gilbert.

526
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,280
Because nobody hurts Arnie,
right?

527
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,480
Okay. You wanna pick out some candy?

528
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,920
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- What do you want?

529
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,680
We've got to keep
a closer eye on him.

530
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,640
- What?
- We've gotta do better.

531
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,720
Are you listening to me?

532
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,240
- Mine.
- And you.

533
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,240
- Huh?
- You have to stay here.

534
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,120
You stay right on this porch.
You don't go anywhere.

535
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,680
- Don't go anywhere.
- Don't go anywhere.

536
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,560
We're not going anywhere, Gilbert.
We're not going anywhere, you know?

537
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,880
We're not going anywhere.
We're not going anywhere.

538
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,160
We're not going...
We're not going anywhere.

539
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,480
We're not going anywhere!
We're not going anywhere!

540
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,520
Gilbert, we're not going anywhere.

541
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,520
We're not going anywhere!
We're not going anywhere.

542
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,640
Where are you going?

543
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,800
Hey!

544
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,160
I'm waiting.
Waitin' for that call, Gilbert.

545
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,040
Hey!

546
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,200
Hi, Gilbert.

547
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,400
- Oh, look. Come here.
- What?

548
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,240
- It's a praying mantis.
- Oh.

549
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,240
You know how they mate? The male
will sneak up on the female...

550
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,360
and she'll bite off his head...

551
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,880
and the rest of his body
will keep on mating.

552
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,120
And then when they're done...

553
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,240
she'll eat him.

554
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,320
She'll eat the rest of him.

555
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,880
Grandma, we have company.
So, do you want to eat?

556
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,080
- Help yourself.
- Oh, thank you. Wow.

557
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,120
Well, we missed the rally
in Des Moines.

558
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,320
If we get on the road by Friday,
we'll be able to make Colorado Springs
in time to catch them.

559
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,680
Have you ever been to Colorado?

560
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,600
No, ma'am.

561
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,600
It must be wonderful.

562
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,640
It must be incredibly
frustrating then...

563
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,280
to be stuck here in this place,
in Endora.

564
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,120
This place
is as good a place as any.

565
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,480
Think so?

566
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,760
She should know.

567
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,520
Becky's been just about
everywhere there is to go.

568
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,520
Places I didn't even know existed.

569
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,840
I'm a worldly kind of girl.

570
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:04,880
Me, I spent most of my whole life
in the same spot.

571
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,560
Why doesn't matter.

572
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,160
Anyway, she encouraged me
to get out.

573
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,440
Now she can't stay put anywhere.

574
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,920
She's the smartest,
most beautiful girl in the world.

575
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,960
Isn't she?
Isn't she beautiful?

576
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,640
Isn't she beautiful?

577
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,160
I'm sorry. She has this thing
with beauty that...

578
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,640
Oh, yeah, I noticed that.

579
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,080
I'm not into that... that whole
external beauty thing, you know.

580
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,480
- 'Cause it... it doesn't last.
- Right.

581
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,080
You're, you know... Eventually,
your face is gonna get wrinkly...

582
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,760
- you'll get grey hair...
- Sure.
- your boobs might sag.

583
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,120
You know? So what?

584
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,200
It's what you do
that really matters.

585
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,840
- Right?
- Yeah, sure.

586
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,960
So what do you wanna do?

587
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,600
Oh, uh, I don't know. I mean,
there's not so much to do here, really.

588
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:09,160
You can think of one thing.
Think of one thing that people do here.

589
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,360
Um...

590
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,520
Thank you.

591
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,600
It was nice meeting you.

592
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,840
Be nice.

593
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,920
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hi.

594
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,120
Can I have yours
and I'll give you mine instead?

595
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,760
No, we want the big one!

596
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,440
You know something?
The one on top of it is fine.

597
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,880
- No, we want the big one!
- Yeah, I like it.

598
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
- Let's go.
- Come on! Get us the big one!

599
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,240
- Come on, Mom. Please?
- Here you go, guys.
- l...

600
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,680
- We want the big one.
- Yeah, that's fine.

601
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,960
It's changing.
That's what's wild about the sunset.

602
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:08,760
It'll just change really,
really slowly in front of your eyes.

603
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,720
I love the sky.

604
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,320
It's so limitless.

605
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,280
It is big.
It's very big.

606
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,240
Big doesn't even sum it up right.

607
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,760
That-That word "big" is so small.

608
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,720
You'd have to get
those really giant words...

609
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,200
to describe the sky.

610
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,720
Oh. Um...

611
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,960
What?

612
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,920
I have to go do this thing.
It's kind of a family thing.

613
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,200
Do you want me to give you a ride
back into town, or do you wanna...

614
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,120
No, actually,
I'm just gonna sit here.

615
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,640
I could come back. I mean, I can...
I can come back and...

616
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,240
- Really?
- Yeah. Will you... You'll be here then?

617
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,440
- Yeah.
- All right.
- I'll just sit here.

618
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,320
All right, I'll be...
I'll be back in a little bit.

619
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,880
- Okay.
- Okay.

620
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,840
- Gilbert.
- Hey, buddy. Come on. We gotta go.

621
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,920
Gotta go. Gotta go. Gotta go.

622
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,040
- Gilbert, where's the duck?
- Where's the duck?
- I can't see the duck anywhere.

623
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,440
- Find him. Look. Where'd he go?
- Where's the duck?

624
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,960
- It's hiding. Find the duck.
- Arnie, I don't have time for this.

625
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,360
Lift up. Okay, good.

626
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,520
- Ducky.
- Good boy. You know what?

627
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,080
- You're such a big boy.
- Yeah.

628
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,800
- You're such a big boy.
- I'm a big boy.
- Hey, you know what?

629
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,520
I bet you could do this all
by yourself if you really wanted to.

630
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,440
- Could you do this by yourself?
- I'm a big boy.

631
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,400
- Yeah, be a big boy.
- Big boy.

632
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,680
- Okay, take this.
- Take this.
- Wash everything.

633
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,640
- Your towels are there...
- Okay.
- and your robe is there.

634
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,880
- Okay.
- Okay?

635
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,440
- The big boy's gonna wash himself.
- Right. Okay.

636
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,680
- I gotta go.
- Okay.
- Gotta go.

637
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,040
- You missed it.
- What did I miss?

638
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,440
- The sunset.
- Really?

639
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,040
- It was beautiful.
- Oh.

640
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,120
Oh, well.

641
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,600
I'd like to see where you live.

642
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,640
- No, you wouldn't.
- Let's go see where you live.

643
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,680
Come on.

644
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,560
My parents split up
when I was a kid.

645
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,560
I go back and forth between them...

646
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,560
'cause they're always moving.

647
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,840
But it's good.
It's my life.

648
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,640
Yeah

649
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,800
We don't really move.

650
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,880
I mean, we'd like to, but...

651
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,320
my mom is sort of
attached to the house.

652
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,200
Attached is, I guess,
not the right word.

653
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,640
She's pretty much wedged in.

654
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,360
- What do you mean?
- That's it. That's the house.

655
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,320
It's really amazing.

656
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,480
I mean, how small it looks
from here, considering the...

657
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,440
the girth of what's inside of it.

658
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,080
I don't know.

659
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,600
Did you ever see
a beached whale on television?

660
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,640
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

661
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,680
That's her.
That's my mom.

662
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,760
What about your dad?

663
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,120
Some other day.
Some other day.

664
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,200
I had a nice time tonight.

665
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,240
I know.

666
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,360
- Good night.
- Good night.

667
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,360
Oh, no. Oh, no.

668
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,560
Oh, Arnie. Come on.
I'm sorry, buddy. Come on.

669
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,960
Here, here.
You're okay. You're okay.

670
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,880
You're okay.
You're okay, buddy.

671
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,720
Come on. Get warm.

672
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,280
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, buddy.

673
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,320
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

674
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,920
Would somebody please explain?

675
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,600
- Gilbert's in charge of bathing.
- I could have "drownded."

676
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,000
I could have "drownded."

677
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,480
- No more baths.
- But you didn't, honey.

678
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:40,880
- You could've, but you didn't.
- No more baths, Mama.

679
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,280
It is too much to ask
to see this boy turn 18?

680
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,400
- No.
- It's ready.

681
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,000
Where's your head lately, Gilbert?

682
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:54,000
Where is your head?
Gilbert?

683
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,560
- Sorry, Mama.
- Sorry isn't good enough.

684
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:01,880
- You gotta do better.
- Gotta do better.

685
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,800
Hey, boss, is that the right price?

686
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,160
That's right.

687
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,880
- It seems like it ought to be more.
- Maybe at Foodland.

688
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,320
We've always had
a reasonable deal on pickles.

689
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,440
Here.

690
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,520
Gilbert, got a delivery
for you, son.

691
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,600
It sounds urgent.

692
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,680
Uh, get out.
Go outside and play, right now.

693
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,560
- But...
- Right now. Hurry up.

694
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,160
- Hi, Betty.
- Hi.

695
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,920
Gilbert, could you dial that number
over there for me?

696
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,560
- My hands are all...
- Oh, yeah, sure.

697
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,080
- How have you been?
- Good.

698
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,080
I saw you last night.

699
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,760
Who's the girl?

700
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,320
- It's ringing.
- I got... Sorry. One sec.

701
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,600
This is good. Taste.

702
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,560
That's good. It's, uh, ringing.

703
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,480
One second.

704
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,800
Hello? Ken Carver here,
Carver Insurance.

705
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,880
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

706
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,800
- Mr Carver?
- "Who is this?"

707
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,200
- Uh, it's Gilbert.
- Gilbert!

708
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,320
- "I'd given up on you, Gilbert."
- Did you?

709
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,200
- "Well, yeah. Can you blame me?"
- No, no.

710
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,240
I mean, how many times do I have
to ask, and still no visit?

711
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,800
- Well, I'm here now.
- Happy anniversary.

712
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,160
<i>Well, we can't discuss this
over the phone. I think it's best...</i>

713
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,080
that we meet man to man,
don't you agree?

714
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,480
- Yes.
- "Today is your lucky day."

715
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,840
I've just had a cancellation.
What about right now? Are you free?

716
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,720
Is that a yes, Gilbert?

717
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,200
- "Huh?"
- Okay.
- "All right."

718
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,200
I'm gonna be waiting
here for you, Gilbert.

719
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,200
Bye.

720
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,160
Do you want me to be killed?
Do you want him to kill me?

721
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,480
Just playing.
Don't-Don't you wanna play?

722
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,600
This is crazy.
I, uh... I've gotta go.

723
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,120
- You don't have to go.
- Yes, I do.

724
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,600
Hey!

725
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,240
It's that new girl, isn't it?

726
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,000
No, it's your husband. He wants me
to come to his office right now.

727
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,200
If you walk out that door...

728
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,600
Don't you dare walk out that door.

729
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,520
You look nervous, Gilbert.

730
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,640
I'd be nervous too if I were you.

731
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,040
If I were in your situation,
I'd be downright panicky.

732
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,480
I reviewed your file.

733
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,720
You've got
no major medical insurance.

734
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,600
No catastrophic, no life.

735
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,000
Gilbert...

736
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:34,760
what if something
were to happen to you?

737
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,400
Something unforeseeable?

738
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,080
Something sudden? Random?

739
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:45,120
An accident, maybe.
What about your family?

740
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,480
Do you ever think about your family?

741
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,880
Now, stop thinking about yourself.
Think about them.

742
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,280
You don't wanna leave 'em
empty-handed.

743
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,880
Ken Carver here.

744
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,960
Look, can't this wait?
I'm in the middle...

745
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:10,400
Oh. Betty, please, calm down.
Calm down.

746
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,880
No, no. l-l...
No, go on.

747
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Go on, go on.

748
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,280
No. No.

749
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,400
No, no. Calm...

750
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,520
I'll... I'm on my way.

751
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,440
Troubles at home.
I'm sure you understand.

752
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,080
Oh, damn.
Betty's got the car.

753
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:48,200
Gilbert, would you give me a ride?

754
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,240
Oh, my God! Betty!

755
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,480
What the hell's going on here?

756
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,520
Todd? Doug?
Betty, what is going on here?

757
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,960
I don't believe this!

758
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:24,240
Oh, great!
Oh, God!

759
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,920
Boys, come on.
Let's...

760
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,920
Let's go show your mom the cookies
that she's baked for us.

761
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,640
This is great.

762
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,120
All right.
Everything's okay.

763
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,040
These aren't burned.

764
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:42,600
Look, honey, they're fine.
They taste fine.

765
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,440
They're a little burnt on top,
but just fine.

766
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,400
They're wonderful.

767
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,360
Boys, here.
Have some of Mom's cookies.

768
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,240
They're really good. Here.

769
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,480
Come on, boys.
Make your mother happy.

770
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,880
Make your mom happy.
Have some cookies. Please. Please.

771
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,760
- Hey.
- Go on!

772
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,160
- What are you doing?
- I could've had any guy. Any guy!
- You want a real pool?

773
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,280
- What do you think this is?
- But...
- Doug, come over here!

774
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,000
- What?
- I chose you.
- It is a pool, son!

775
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,160
- I chose you.
- I got you a real pool, for God's sake!

776
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,560
Look! There's water in here!

777
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,160
Come here! Come here!
Get over here!

778
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,240
Come here!
Get inside the pool!

779
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,240
Get inside the pool with your brother!
Come here!

780
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,800
- Why did you?
- Get inside the pool!

781
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,640
Yeah. Look.
Real water, boys.

782
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,280
Okay, so I don't...

783
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,280
- Because...
- I give you all I have,
for Christ's sake!

784
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,040
- I knew you'd always be there.
- I've given you everything!
- Because...

785
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:43,640
- Here's a pool!
- Because I knew you'd never leave.
- A trampoline!

786
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,320
What the hell else more do you want?

787
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,120
What? For God's sake!

788
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,960
Son, get back in the pool.
Get back in the pool!

789
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,600
We're all gonna enjoy it!
It's a lot of fun, isn't it?

790
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,600
I'm doin' the best I can here.
I can't do any better!

791
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,920
I can't give any more!
I've given enough already!

792
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,440
<i>l- l-I guess maybe
I'd better be getting off.</i>

793
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,600
<i>Not yet.</i>

794
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,560
- "Arthur, in all my life..."
- Move, Amy.

795
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,760
<i>I wondered, where is he?</i>

796
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,960
<i>Just this moment, just now.</i>

797
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,640
<i>What is he looking at?
What is he thinking?</i>

798
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,160
I think it's time for Arnie
to take a bath.

799
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,080
No!

800
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,320
Don't you think it's time
for Arnie to take a bath, Gilbert?

801
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,640
Just let him stink.

802
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,840
- I don't wanna take a bath!
- Please.
- No!

803
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,640
You know Mr Carver?

804
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,760
Well, he's dead.

805
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,520
He's dead.

806
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,840
Okay, kids, hurry up.
Let's go.

807
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,640
- Hi.
- Hey.

808
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,600
- What's going on?
- He drowned.

809
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,920
- You're kidding?
- No. In that.

810
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:42,760
- A kiddie pool. I don't get it.
- Wow.

811
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,680
It's like one foot deep.
Weird, right?

812
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,080
- Oh, yeah.
- He-He "drownded."
- Shh, shh, shh.

813
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,560
Shh, shh, shh. Come on.

814
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,400
All right?
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

815
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,040
He had the cardiac arrest.

816
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:03,760
His head bent forward,
his knees buckled...

817
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,240
and then he just fell...

818
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,600
face forward into the pool.

819
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,120
When she found him,
he was already dead.

820
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,360
That's what we don't know.
That's what nobody knows.

821
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:18,320
No, I know it. I would...
I saw the... I saw the... I saw the body.

822
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,200
- I saw the... I prepared it.
I know exactly what...
- You don't know...

823
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,440
I would have seen...
I would have seen what...

824
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,120
if there was any kind of struggle
that had gone on.

825
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,000
- It was murder.
- No.

826
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,120
What do you think?
What do you think?

827
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:35,320
I, uh, I don't know.
I, um... You know, it's-it's possible.

828
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,880
Bob, we're talking about
thousands and thousands of dollars.

829
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,840
- If she saw...
- She doesn't have to work...
- Even if she did wanna do it...

830
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,720
- She doesn't have to work
for the rest of her life.
- Even if she did...

831
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,840
If-lf you saw somebody laying...

832
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,960
with their head down
in the pool motionless...

833
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,120
or even if they were kind of
limply doing that...

834
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,760
- which he wasn't doing,
but even if that...
- You don't know that!

835
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:59,640
Well, it-it was an extreme,
uh, "post-cardial" infarction.

836
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,760
- Extreme.
- So nothing's fishy?
- N-No.

837
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,800
Hey, Gilbert, look!
It's that girl!

838
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,160
- Gilbert, it's that girl!
- It's perfectly logical.

839
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,880
Even if it's...
Listen. Wait a minute, Tucker.

840
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,440
We're not talkin' about...
We're not talkin' about
takin' a gun and shootin' somebody.

841
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:18,520
- We're talkin' about pushin' along
something that's rolling that direction.
- Hi!

842
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,120
- Please, play with me over there.
- Okay.
- Please?

843
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,400
Come on. Let's play over there.
Come on. Please play...

844
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,000
- Hi.
- How are you doin'?
- Fine.

845
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,440
- Will you play over there?
Will you play?
- Okay. Okay, we'll play.

846
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,200
- Settle down.
- We're gonna play!
- Okay, okay.

847
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,160
- Will you give us a ride?
- Yeah, yeah.

848
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,840
So, that's it.

849
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,760
Yeah, I guess so.

850
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,600
The magic part.

851
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,640
The magic part?

852
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,040
The magic part, Gilbert?

853
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,440
- Hey, could we go...
- Grandma, here it is.
- Yeah?

854
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:11,080
- Oh, thanks.
- Can we go play now?

855
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,280
- What are we gonna play?
- Hi.
- Hi.

856
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,000
Can we play hide-and-go-seek?
Hide-and-go-seek?

857
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,680
- You like that?
- Gilbert?
- Mm-hmm?

858
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,880
- Would you give me some help?
- Yeah, go ahead.

859
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,760
- Hang on one second.
- Okay.

860
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,800
Try it.

861
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,120
- I don't know.
- Yeah, I don't know.

862
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:48,760
I don't...
It's a mystery.

863
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,760
- Gilbert, listen, thanks anyway.
- No problem.

864
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,680
Come play with me in the water.

865
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,200
You can't find me.
You can't find me anywhere.

866
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,720
Say-Say "Where's Arnie?"
Say that.

867
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,000
No, I want you to come in with me.

868
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,880
No.

869
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,120
Say "Where's Arnie?"

870
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,720
Say "Where's Arnie?"
Say that.

871
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,120
Where's Arnie?

872
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:16,680
You can't find me.
Say it again. Hi!

873
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,120
Say it again,
and you gotta look for me around.

874
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,360
I wanted you
to swim with me, Arnie.

875
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,040
Don't even try it, 'cause he's...
he's had a scare with water...

876
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,440
and he won't...
he won't come in.

877
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,800
I'm not comin' in the water.

878
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,240
- You wanna come in the water?
- No.

879
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,320
Why not?

880
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,760
Are you scared
to come in the water?

881
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,600
- No, no.
- Are you sure?

882
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:49,200
- I'm sure.
- He's scared.

883
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,080
Are you scared, Gilbert?

884
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,560
All right, what do you want to see?
Do you want to see...

885
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,800
Do you want to see me get wet
a little, like this?

886
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,000
- Yeah.
- A little splash?

887
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,080
A little more.

888
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,320
Do you wanna see this?

889
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:14,680
You want this, right?
Huh? You happy?

890
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,440
Tell me what you want
as fast as it comes to you.

891
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,960
- Okay?
- Okay.

892
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:31,040
Okay, what do you want?

893
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,680
- Faster!
- Okay.

894
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,760
I want a new thing.

895
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,720
House. I want a new house
for the family.

896
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,320
I want a...
I want Mama...

897
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,560
to take aerobics classes.

898
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,360
I want Ellen to grow up.

899
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,840
I want a new brain for Arnie.

900
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,560
I want...

901
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,400
What do you want for you?

902
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,520
Just for you.

903
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,760
I want to be a good person.

904
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,400
I can't... I can't do this.
I can't...

905
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,640
- Okay.
- Where's Arnie?

906
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,720
Arnie?

907
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,040
Excuse me, ma'am,
have you seen my brother?

908
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,160
No.

909
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,720
Shit.

910
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,760
- Hey!
- Come on.

911
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,360
Hey! Over here!

912
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,880
- Hang on, son.
- Come on, now.

913
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,920
- I did it again!
- Get this unbuckled.

914
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,600
All right, here we go.
There you go.

915
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,800
It's all right, Jerry. I got him.
I got him. It's all right, Jerry.

916
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,280
We're takin' him in.

917
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,320
It's not gonna happen again,
I promise this time.

918
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,360
We've warned you,
we've warned your sister...

919
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,280
that the next time
was gonna be the last time.

920
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:31,000
- Great. Great.
- Flash the lights!
Play the siren, okay?

921
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:33,120
- I don't believe this.
- Play the siren for me!

922
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,200
Way to go, Gilbert.

923
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:40,080
- Jerry, listen. You're gonna... You're
gonna have to take it easy on him.
- We'll take care of him, Gilbert.

924
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:43,800
- You gotta... Really,
you gotta keep an eye on him.
- All right. All right.

925
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:46,080
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

926
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:50,240
Do the siren. Do the siren, okay?
Do the siren, all right?

927
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,000
I know, Sheriff.

928
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,840
I know that, Sheriff.

929
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,880
Okay. Asshole!

930
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,920
They're probably just teaching him
a lesson. They're probably just
proving a point.

931
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:20,000
Yeah. That's right.

932
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,280
Get my coat.

933
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,080
What?

934
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,800
Get my coat.

935
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,360
Get it!

936
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,640
Let's go.

937
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,840
Well, at least he's in a safe place.
At least someone's watching him.

938
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,880
Ellen, shut up.

939
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,480
You guys wait here.
I'll be right back, okay?

940
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:25,040
Mama. Mama,
let Gilbert handle this.

941
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:36,680
- Jerry, come on, please.
- Please, have a seat outside.

942
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,720
- Please, you gotta let him out.
- You need to wait your turn, okay?

943
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,200
- I don't think you guys understand.
It's gonna be...
- Look.

944
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:48,320
No one's going to do a thing
until you go and sit down outside...

945
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,200
Jerry!

946
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,760
Jerry!

947
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,920
Jerry!

948
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:12,680
Jerry, I've come for my son.

949
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:17,240
<i>Sheriff?
Sheriff, are you there?</i>

950
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,520
Bonnie, you'll need
to fill out some papers.

951
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,840
No! No!

952
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,440
- Police procedure requires...
- I want my boy, Jerry.

953
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:29,040
- But Bonnie, you have to calm...
- My son! Give me my son!

954
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,600
Come on. You're goin' home.

955
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:48,440
Sunshine, you're free!
Oh, baby.

956
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:52,600
- Don't disappear like that any more.
- Okay.

957
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:56,160
- Promise me.
- Mom!

958
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,880
You're free, baby. You're free.
Let's go home.

959
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,880
Hi!

960
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,960
Look!

961
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,480
That's why she needs a cane.

962
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,640
Look at her!

963
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:16,360
Mama, they didn't
flash the lights for me either.

964
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,120
Flash the lights.

965
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,280
Hey!

966
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,680
Look at me!

967
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:35,640
I'm hiding!
Say-Say "Where's Arnie?"

968
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:38,040
- Say like that.
- Arnie, get down.

969
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:44,360
Gilbert, come find me.

970
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,800
Where's Arnie?

971
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,280
Hey.

972
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:54,600
That's my mom in there.

973
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:57,000
My mama.

974
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:00,000
Gilbert,
come play with me up here.

975
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,320
Come play with me.

976
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,160
God, that was so brave,
what your mother did.

977
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:25,240
You know that, right?

978
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,160
I'd like to meet her.

979
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,240
No, you wouldn't.

980
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,920
Hey, where do you go next?

981
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:17,160
I would like to meet your mom.

982
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:29,920
In sure and certain hope of
the resurrection to eternal life...

983
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,240
we commend to Almighty God
our brother, Kenneth Carver...

984
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,480
and we commit his body
to the ground.

985
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:40,640
Earth to earth...

986
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:44,280
ashes to ashes
and dust to dust.

987
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,000
The Lord bless him
and keep him.

988
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,840
The Lord make his face
shine on him...

989
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:53,000
and be gracious to him.

990
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:56,040
The Lord look upon him
with favour...

991
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:59,200
and give him peace.

992
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:04,040
Lord Jesus, by your death
you took away the sting of death.

993
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:07,160
Grant to us, your servants,
so to follow in faith...

994
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:09,800
- for you have led the way...
- Hey! Hey!

995
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:12,520
- that we may at length
fall asleep peacefully in you...
- Lookit here!

996
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,400
- Lookit here!
- great in your likeness...

997
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:20,280
- Look where I'm pointing!
- the God of peace who brought again
from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ.

998
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:23,640
The great shepherd of the sheep,
through the blood of
the everlasting covenant...

999
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:28,000
- It's a Burger Barn, Gilbert!
- make you perfect in
every good work to do his will...

1000
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:32,240
- Gilbert, it's a Burger Barn!
- working in you that which is
well pleasing in his sight...

1001
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,760
- Burger Barn!
- through Jesus Christ, amen.

1002
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:45,320
- Hey.
- Boys, you can have anything you want.

1003
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:49,720
You could get candy if you want.
You can have candy if you want too.

1004
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,440
As for me,
something with menthol, please.

1005
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:55,160
You like gum?
Do you like gum?

1006
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,760
I like gum.
Here's a good kind.

1007
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:01,320
- Here, take this.
You can have it. Take it.
- Hey.

1008
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:07,640
- You want gum too?
- We're going to St Louis.

1009
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,920
I can't stay in that house.

1010
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,080
I really am sorry about your...

1011
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,640
Here, Mommy will take care of it.
You run on outside.

1012
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,160
Everybody thinks I killed him.

1013
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:33,000
Do you?

1014
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,400
No.

1015
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,600
I miss him...

1016
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,320
and I don't.

1017
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:53,320
I miss him, and I don't.

1018
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:11,920
So, Gilbert,
what's to become of you?

1019
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,440
Oh, I'll probably just...

1020
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:19,680
You haven't thought about it.

1021
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:23,680
Poor Gilbert... cooped up...

1022
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:27,320
taking care of everybody else,
forgettin' all about you.

1023
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,960
- Mommy?
- Mommy is coming in a minute, honey.

1024
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:32,040
Okay.

1025
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,960
Concerning my boys?

1026
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:42,760
I was thinkin' that if my boys
turn out anything like you...

1027
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,840
Hi.

1028
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,880
I was thinkin'
how that would be nice...

1029
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,320
for my boys to be like you.

1030
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,600
He's all yours.

1031
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,760
Are you gonna miss her?

1032
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,240
Yeah.

1033
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,720
Good.

1034
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,480
Damn it!

1035
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:18,000
So, what do you think?

1036
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,560
- Wow.
- Right?
- Wow.

1037
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:25,600
Right?
Here, try a milkshake.

1038
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,320
Real milk in there.

1039
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:35,080
- You're kidding.
- Real milk.

1040
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:44,360
Bob... Oh, Bob.

1041
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:47,600
- Hey! Congratulations!
This looks great!
- Thanks, Bob.

1042
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:49,960
- Yeah, thanks. Thanks a million.
- What?

1043
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,600
What, are you tryin'
to depress everybody?
You're gonna ruin everyone's appetite.

1044
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:56,920
Hey, hey. l... Mike, right?
You wanna come to my party tomorrow?

1045
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,560
I'm gonna be 18 years old.
Wanna come?

1046
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:03,080
You can come too, if you want to.
I don't know you, but you can come.

1047
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:08,480
<i>How nice to see so many of you here
on this great day.</i>

1048
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:12,560
<i>This day marks the beginning
of a new era for Endora...</i>

1049
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:17,280
<i>for the Burger Barn family and,
I hope, for all of you.</i>

1050
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:20,240
<i>We at Burger Barn are committed...</i>

1051
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:25,360
<i>- "to a very special relationship with"
you, one that will last and last.
- Hi.</i>

1052
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:28,880
<i>In a time when so many things
are falling apart...</i>

1053
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:32,200
<i>Endora decides to give
Burger Barn a chance...</i>

1054
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,720
<i>a new breath of life.</i>

1055
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:40,640
She fixed it.
The camper's fixed...

1056
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:43,480
and we're gonna
be leaving tomorrow.

1057
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,240
Come on!

1058
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:29,560
Hey, you can come to my party
tomorrow, okay? You can come.

1059
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:31,640
Okay.

1060
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:40,800
- Hey!
- Hi, Arnie.
- So, I'm invited.

1061
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:46,400
Okay.

1062
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:56,560
- Do you not want me to go?
- No.

1063
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:59,640
I mean, go if you want.

1064
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:06,560
Oh, so this is...
is this how you want it?

1065
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,880
I have to go.

1066
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:19,840
Take care, okay?

1067
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,320
Goodbye, Arnie.

1068
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,560
- Oh, no.
- Come on, let's get that bath.

1069
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,480
No. No!

1070
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:41,040
Hey, Arnie?

1071
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,760
- Arnie?
- Guys!

1072
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,680
Arnie.

1073
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:48,560
You gotta take a bath, Arnie.

1074
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,840
Arnie.

1075
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,880
Arnie, you gotta do it.
It's your birthday.

1076
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:58,880
- Arnie!
- Oh, no!
- Damn it!

1077
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,600
Arnie, no!

1078
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:05,760
Oh, God.

1079
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,880
I can't make another one.
I can't.

1080
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,880
We have to have a cake, Gilbert.

1081
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:33,520
<i>Attention, Foodland shoppers.
Remember, every day this week...</i>

1082
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,680
<i>is a double coupon day.</i>

1083
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,840
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yes.

1084
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:51,240
Um, my sister called in
an order for Grape.

1085
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:53,480
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's all set.

1086
01:20:55,360 --> 01:21:00,240
There you go.
That'll be 19.75.

1087
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,480
- Go away, Arnie.
- Gilbert, what's in there?

1088
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:22,720
- It's a surprise. Leave it alone.
- What's-What's in that box?

1089
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,720
Don't touch it.
If you touch it, I'm gonna kill you.

1090
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,720
I can't believe you.

1091
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:30,960
Look, I'll enjoy the party
from in here. It'll be fine.

1092
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,240
Now, you'll see.
Everything'll be just fine.

1093
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,360
What am I
supposed to say to people?

1094
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:40,680
I mean, it's Arnie's 18th birthday.
Haven't you been waiting
to do this for a long time?

1095
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,920
I mean, wasn't it you that wanted to
have this huge party in the first place?

1096
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,520
I didn't want to.

1097
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:50,760
- Damn it!
- I can't believe you!

1098
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:54,280
- Arnie!
- Oh, man.
- Look, he's eating the cake!

1099
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:56,560
- Shit!
- Arnie!
- That's it. Forget it.

1100
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,680
- Forget it.
- Nice job, Arnie.
- Arnie!

1101
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,760
Now what are we gonna do?

1102
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:04,720
Arnie! Arnie.

1103
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,920
Come here. Come here! Come here!

1104
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,360
Do you know what that fucking cost?
Do you know what I had to do?

1105
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:14,040
Come on.
No, no, it's time for your bath.

1106
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,600
Get your clothes off.
Get 'em off!

1107
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:34,720
- Get in that bath.
- Gilbert, no!
- Get your fucking clothes off.

1108
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,800
Come on.

1109
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,680
- Gilbert, no!
- Don't move. Don't move!

1110
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,560
Gilbert, stop!

1111
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:14,400
Gilbert!

1112
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,480
What did you do?

1113
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,840
Mama!

1114
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:40,440
Arnie?

1115
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:45,040
Arnie!

1116
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,640
What is goin' on?

1117
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:55,760
Don't worry, Mama.
Ellen, let's go.

1118
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,080
- We should call his mother.
- No, no, no. It's okay. I know...

1119
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:52,400
I know where he lives.
I can take him.

1120
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:54,520
It's really okay. Yeah.

1121
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,320
Arnie, you wanna go for a walk?

1122
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:10,400
You wanna go play, Arnie?

1123
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,200
Come on, Arnie.

1124
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:44,560
Come on, Arnie.
You can do it.

1125
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:50,120
Come on, Arnie.
You can do it. Come on.

1126
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:53,280
- "Merrily, merrily." Sing that.
- Okay.

1127
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,600
<i>Row, row, row your boat</i>

1128
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:58,720
<i>Gently down the stream</i>

1129
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,120
Yea! Yea!
You did it!

1130
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:06,520
Good job, Arnie!
You did it!

1131
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:15,880
So I'll see you
in a little bit, okay?

1132
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,200
- Bye!
- Bye, Arnie.

1133
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:19,920
Take care.

1134
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:23,160
You know, I "drownded," huh?
I "drownded" over there.

1135
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,920
No, you just got clean.

1136
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:31,240
Arnie!

1137
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,760
Hi! How are you?

1138
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,760
- No, I'm fine.
- You sure?

1139
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:42,120
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- All right.

1140
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:45,440
- Bye!
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

1141
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:16,960
I hit him.

1142
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:19,200
I hit him so hard, l...

1143
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,960
He's gonna be okay.

1144
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:29,840
You don't hurt Arnie.
You just don't.

1145
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:43,760
I gotta go. I gotta go.

1146
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:16,400
I got nowhere to go.

1147
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:25,880
I had to work extra hours
just to feed her.

1148
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:30,240
So it's your fault?

1149
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:34,240
You don't understand. She was
in shock for years. He disappeared.

1150
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:37,240
He didn't say goodbye.
He just...

1151
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:42,480
One day, all of a sudden...

1152
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,120
he was gone.

1153
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,480
He was just hangin' there.

1154
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:54,960
That's when it all started.

1155
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:59,800
She used to be so pretty.

1156
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:04,640
She was so pretty
and so fun.

1157
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:09,640
So you think it's his fault?

1158
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,960
No.

1159
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:19,120
Nobody knew what he felt.
He didn't give anything.

1160
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:22,000
He was just sort of there.

1161
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,480
You'd try to play with him,
you know, get him to play around...

1162
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:28,680
or get him to laugh
or get him to smile or get him to...

1163
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:31,000
I don't know... get mad.

1164
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:35,640
But nothin'.

1165
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:40,440
Just like, uh, he was already dead.

1166
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:47,000
I used to know a guy like that.

1167
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:16,680
- Hey.
- Hi.

1168
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:24,200
It's Arnie's birthday.

1169
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:26,240
I need to go home.

1170
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:53,480
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1171
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:55,560
Give my regards to your mother.

1172
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:00,160
- Hey, Amy, look who's here.
- Where you been?

1173
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:02,720
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- He's alive.

1174
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:25,840
Amy?

1175
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:27,920
Where's Arnie?

1176
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,040
Amy. Please, Amy.

1177
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:41,400
Is he okay?

1178
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,160
I think you better
ask him that yourself.

1179
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,480
Where is he?

1180
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:03,840
I wonder where he could be.

1181
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:14,920
Amy?

1182
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:20,760
Have you seen Arnie?

1183
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:23,400
Um, no, I thought he was with you.

1184
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:25,720
- No.
- No?

1185
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,320
No.

1186
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,840
Arnie?

1187
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:42,560
Arnie? Anybody seen Arnie?

1188
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:46,720
Where's my brother?

1189
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,560
Boo!

1190
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,320
Boo.

1191
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,680
Come here.

1192
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,600
You scared me, buddy.

1193
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:16,200
You scared Gilbert.
Don't scare Gilbert, okay?

1194
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:20,200
- Don't scare Gilbert, okay?
- Okay.

1195
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:38,360
Come here.

1196
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:40,680
Who's got you?

1197
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:59,160
You better talk to Mama.

1198
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:05,240
Mama?

1199
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,840
Mama?

1200
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:23,000
What you did was...

1201
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:29,320
He's a helpless boy, Gilbert.

1202
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:39,400
And then disappearing like that?

1203
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,920
I hate that.

1204
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,080
You know how I hate that.

1205
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:52,400
You walked out,
and I thought...

1206
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,680
I can't take another.

1207
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:01,600
But you came back, Gilbert.

1208
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:04,080
Why?

1209
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:05,920
Why did you?

1210
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:16,040
I don't know, Mama.

1211
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:22,120
I'm here now.
I'm here now.

1212
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:27,560
Yes, you are.

1213
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:30,720
You came back for the party.

1214
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:39,320
Oh, Gilbert.

1215
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:43,320
I can't imagine
how it's been for you kids.

1216
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:48,920
I know what a burden I am.

1217
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Don't say that.

1218
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:54,760
I know it.

1219
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:57,680
And I know that
you're ashamed of me.

1220
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,680
No, I'm not.

1221
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:04,320
No, I'm not.

1222
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:15,560
I never, never meant
to be like this.

1223
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:21,040
I never wanted to be a joke.

1224
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:24,360
- You're no joke, Mama.
- I never wanted to be.

1225
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,840
You're no joke.

1226
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:29,840
- You're no joke.
- Oh, Gilbert.

1227
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:33,920
Please don't disappear.
Please don't disappear.

1228
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:45,320
- Hurry! Hurry!
- You're really growing up to be
quite a young lady.

1229
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:48,800
- Thanks.
- Hey. Hi.
- Hey.

1230
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:50,880
You know, I don't want to
rain on the day here...

1231
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:52,960
but you have a serious
foundation problem.

1232
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:56,600
You see how this...
the porch is slanted right here?

1233
01:38:56,680 --> 01:39:00,320
I mean, this is
a serious problem, Gilbert.
We need to get up underneath here...

1234
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:03,480
First of all, we need to fill this in
so that no more water collects here.

1235
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:05,600
And then we'll probably...
What?

1236
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,040
- Hi.
- Hi.

1237
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:16,640
- Hello, Gilbert.
- Nana.

1238
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:21,600
- You ready?
- For what?

1239
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:25,560
I want you to...
I want you to come meet somebody.

1240
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:29,000
Okay.

1241
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:31,520
- Hey!
- Hi, Arnie.
- Hi.

1242
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:34,880
- Here's your present.
- Arnie, what do you say?

1243
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:36,960
Thank you!

1244
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:45,360
Mama?

1245
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:51,080
Mama, I want you
to meet somebody.

1246
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:55,400
- No!
- Please?

1247
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:00,240
- Just this once, for me?
- Gilbert, it's okay.

1248
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:03,440
- We can do it later.
- No. This is what I want.

1249
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:07,160
Do it for me, please?

1250
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:10,240
This is different.
Nobody's gonna laugh.

1251
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:13,080
I'm not gonna hurt you
any more, Mama.

1252
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:15,720
I promise.

1253
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:18,720
Please.

1254
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:24,200
Okay.

1255
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:27,720
Okay. Becky?

1256
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:39,480
Mama, this is Becky.

1257
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:41,960
- Hello.
- Hi.

1258
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:51,560
I haven't always been like this.

1259
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:56,560
I haven't always been like this.

1260
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:06,120
- I'm called a miracle.
- You're a miracle?

1261
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:08,600
- I'm a miracle.
- A walking miracle. I can believe that.

1262
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:11,160
I'm just gonna put this up here.

1263
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:14,640
- Uh, bye.
- Goodbye, Arnie.

1264
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:16,520
- Bye.
- You take care.

1265
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,880
I had a really nice time.

1266
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:31,880
I know.

1267
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:45,080
- I don't know what to say.
- Say, "Thank you," Gilbert.

1268
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:47,360
Say, "Thank you."

1269
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:58,680
Thank you.

1270
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:10,560
- Goodbye.
- No, it's not goodbye, Arnie.

1271
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:15,560
It's goodnight. Goodnight...
Goodnight to you, but not me.

1272
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:17,840
Hey, they're coming!

1273
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:20,960
Bye! Wait!

1274
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:44,400
Mama?

1275
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:50,080
Mama, what are you doing?

1276
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:59,400
<i>To work in Danny's office.</i>

1277
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:03,760
<i>I thought you'd be pleased.</i>

1278
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:05,840
<i>Oh, I am pleased.</i>

1279
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:10,680
<i>So close your eyes.</i>

1280
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:40,360
Amy? Amy?

1281
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:47,280
You rest, Mama.

1282
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
You deserve to rest.

1283
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:56,360
Amy, get me my birthday boy.

1284
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:58,440
- I want my birthday boy.
- Okay.

1285
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:02,080
Here, Mama.
Here's the water.

1286
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:04,160
Gilbert.

1287
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:10,600
You're my knight
in shimmering armour.

1288
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:12,720
Did you know that?

1289
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:15,840
I think you mean shining.

1290
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:20,240
No. Shimmering.

1291
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,680
You shimmer and you glow.

1292
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:34,640
You rest, okay?
Get some sleep.

1293
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:52,680
Hey!

1294
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:56,760
Mama!

1295
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:01,400
Mama! Mama!

1296
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:03,800
Wake up!

1297
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:07,800
You're hiding, huh?

1298
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:12,080
I know that.

1299
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:16,840
Wake up!

1300
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:23,120
Mama, wake up!

1301
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:58,800
Mama, stop it now!

1302
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:01,040
Stop, Mama!

1303
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:06,040
Stop it.

1304
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:15,320
Arnie? Arnie?

1305
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:19,960
What's wrong?

1306
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:22,040
What's wrong? Stop it!

1307
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:25,640
Gilbert!

1308
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:27,720
Gilbert!

1309
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:31,400
- Arnie!
- Don't... Give me... Stop!

1310
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:13,320
Mom!

1311
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:28,640
I'm gonna need
some more men, Amy.

1312
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:33,760
Hey, flash the lights.
Flash 'em.

1313
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:37,440
<i>You may need the National Guard
to move her out of there.</i>

1314
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:39,520
I'm sorry about that.

1315
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:53,160
l-It's gonna take a crane
to get her out.

1316
01:47:57,640 --> 01:47:59,840
There's gonna be a crowd.

1317
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:04,080
I just know
there's gonna be a crowd.

1318
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:15,560
She's so beautiful.

1319
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:18,360
She's no joke. She's no joke.

1320
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:30,680
I'm not gonna let her be a joke.

1321
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:53,560
Arnie.

1322
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:58,040
We're gonna need your help.

1323
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:13,240
Gilbert, is that them?

1324
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:15,800
No. No, not yet.

1325
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:19,280
- When are they gonna come?
- Pretty soon.

1326
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:21,600
Pretty soon.

1327
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:24,320
My brother Arnie's
about to turn 19.

1328
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:28,640
Nineteen.

1329
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:31,360
Gilbert, look there!

1330
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:33,960
Amy got a job offer
to manage a bakery in Des Moines.

1331
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:35,720
- Is that them?
- Yeah, that's them.

1332
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:38,560
Ellen can't wait
to switch schools.

1333
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:40,480
Arnie asked if we were gonna
go, too, and I said...

1334
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:45,200
"Well, we can go anywhere
if we want.

1335
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:48,280
- Becky!
- We can go anywhere."

1336
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:50,360
Becky's comin', huh, Gilbert?

1337
01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:52,720
Yep. She's comin'.

1338
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:55,160
Becky!

1339
01:53:55,240 --> 01:53:57,520
Come on! Come on, Gilbert.

1340
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:16,240
Hey!

1341
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:22,840
Hi! Hi.

1342
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:25,600
Hi! Hi!

1343
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,920
- I'm fine.
- Hi!
- How are you?
