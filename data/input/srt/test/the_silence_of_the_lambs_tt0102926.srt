1
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,200
Starling!

2
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,830
Starling!

3
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,840
Crawford wants to see you in his office.

4
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,000
Thank you, sir.

5
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,380
- Clarice.
- Hey.

6
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:44,690
You looking for Crawford? He should
be back in a minute. Wait in his office.

7
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,700
Starling.

8
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,250
- Clarice M. Good morning.
- Morning, Mr Crawford.

9
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,760
Sorry to pull you off the course
at such short notice.

10
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,100
Your instructors tell me you're doing well.
in the top quarter of your class.

11
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,350
I hope so. They haven't
posted any grades yet.

12
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,220
A job's come up and I thought about you.

13
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,770
Not a job, really. More of
an interesting errand. Sit down.

14
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,730
Yes, sir.

15
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:12,950
I remember you from my seminar at UVA.
You grilled me pretty hard, as I recall,

16
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,080
on the Bureau's civil rights record
in the Hoover years. I gave you an A.

17
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,670
A-minus, sir.

18
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,460
Double major: Psych and criminology.
Graduated magna.

19
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,380
Summer internships
at the Reitzinger Clinic.

20
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:32,390
It says, when you graduate, you wanna
work for me in Behavioral Science.

21
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,560
Yes, very much, sir. Very much.

22
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,930
We're interviewing all serial killers now in
custody for a psycho-behavioral profile.

23
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,690
Could be a real help in unsolved cases.

24
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,350
Most of them have been
happy to talk to us.

25
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,950
- Do you spook easily, Starling?
- Not yet, sir.

26
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,860
See, the one we want most
refuses to cooperate.

27
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,780
I want you to go after him
again today in the asylum.

28
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,960
- Who's the subject?
- The psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter.

29
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,320
Hannibal the Cannibal.

30
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,130
I don't expect him to talk to you.

31
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,870
But I have to be able to say we tried.

32
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,130
So if he won't cooperate,
I want just straight reporting.

33
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,840
How does he look? How does
his cell look? Is he sketching, drawing?

34
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,640
If he is, what's he sketching?

35
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,400
Here's a dossier on Lecter.

36
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,160
A copy of our questionnaire
and a special ID for you.

37
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,960
Have your memo on my desk
by 0800 Wednesday.

38
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,120
OK.

39
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,710
Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?
Lecter's been in prison for so many years.

40
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,170
Is there some connection
between him and Buffalo Bill maybe?

41
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,050
I wish there were.
Now, I want your full attention, Starling.

42
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,630
- Yes, sir.
- Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.

43
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:59,690
Dr Chilton at the asylum will go over all
the physical procedures used with him.

44
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,430
Do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever.

45
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,140
And you're to tell him nothing personal.

46
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,860
Believe me, you don't want
Hannibal Lecter inside your head.

47
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,030
Just do your job,
but never forget what he is.

48
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,190
And what is that?

49
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,660
Oh, he's a monster. A pure psychopath.

50
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,320
So rare to capture one alive.

51
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,950
From a research point of view,
Lecter is our most prized asset.

52
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,920
We get a lot of detectives here, but
I can't ever remember one as attractive.

53
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,800
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?

54
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:45,060
Because this can be quite a fun town
if you have the right guide.

55
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,390
I'm sure this is a great town, Dr Chilton,

56
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,940
but my instructions are to talk to Dr Lecter
and report back this afternoon.

57
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,400
I see. Well, let's make this quick, then.

58
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:01,280
We've tried to study him, but he's much
too sophisticated for the standard tests.

59
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,700
Oh, my, does he hate us!

60
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:07,080
He thinks I'm his nemesis.

61
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,300
Crawford's very clever,
isn't he, using you?

62
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,720
- What do you mean, sir?
- A pretty, young woman to turn him on.

63
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,930
I don't believe Lecter's
seen a woman in eight years.

64
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,930
And are you ever his taste! So to speak.

65
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,070
I graduated from UVA, Doctor.
It's not a charm school.

66
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,810
Good. Then you should
be able to remember the rules.

67
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,360
Do not touch or approach the glass.
You pass him nothing but soft paper.

68
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,240
No pencils or pens.
No staples or paperclips in his paper.

69
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:44,170
Use the sliding food carrier. If he attempts
to pass you anything, do not accept it.

70
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,960
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, I understand, sir.

71
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,420
I'm going to show you
why we insist on such precautions.

72
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:57,140
On July 8, 1981, he complained of chest
pains and was taken to the dispensary.

73
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,930
His restraints were removed for an EKG.

74
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,810
When the nurse leaned over him,
he did this to her.

75
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:10,520
The doctors managed to reset her jaw,
more or less, save one of her eyes.

76
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:15,230
His pulse never got above 85,
even when he ate her tongue.

77
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,940
- I keep him in here.
- Dr Chilton.

78
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,490
If Lecter feels that you're his enemy,

79
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:29,580
then maybe we'll have more luck
if I go in by myself. What do you think?

80
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,750
You might have suggested this
in my office and saved me the time.

81
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,130
Yes, sir, but then I would have missed
the pleasure of your company, sir.

82
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,140
When she's finished, bring her out.

83
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:20,350
Hi, I'm Barney. He told you,
don't get near the glass?

84
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,510
Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.

85
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:27,640
Nice to meet you, Clarice. You can
hang your coat up there if you like.

86
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,230
Thank you. I will.

87
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,850
He's past the others, the last cell.

88
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,440
You keep to the right.

89
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,320
- I put out a chair for you.
- That's very good. Thank you.

90
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,540
I'll be watching. You'll do fine.

91
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,300
Hi.

92
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,940
I can smell your cunt!

93
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,840
- Good morning.
- Dr Lecter, my name is Clarice Starling.

94
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,850
May I speak with you?

95
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,600
You're one of Jack Crawford's,
aren't you?

96
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,980
- I am, yes.
- May I see your credentials?

97
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,650
Certainly.

98
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,400
Closer, please.

99
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,070
Closer.

100
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,390
That expires in one week.
You're not real FBI, are you?

101
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,340
I'm still in training at the academy.

102
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,430
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?

103
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,770
Yes, I'm a student.
I'm here to learn from you.

104
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,860
Maybe you can decide whether or not
I'm qualified enough to do that.

105
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,650
That is rather slippery of you,
Agent Starling.

106
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,700
Sit, please.

107
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:58,210
Now then, tell me.
What did Miggs say to you?

108
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,040
Multiple Miggs in the next cell.

109
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,380
He hissed at you. What did he say?

110
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,720
He said "I can smell your cunt."

111
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,610
I see.

112
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,190
I myself cannot.

113
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,250
You use Evyan skin cream.

114
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,870
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps.

115
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,670
But not today.

116
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,680
Did you do all these drawings, Doctor?

117
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,130
That is the Duomo
seen from the Belvedere.

118
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,270
- Do you know Florence?
- All that detail just from memory, sir?

119
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,440
Memory, Agent Starling,
is what I have instead of a view.

120
00:14:54,570 --> 00:15:00,440
Well, perhaps you'd care to lend us
your view on this questionnaire, sir.

121
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,280
Oh, no, no, no, no.

122
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:08,290
You were doing fine. You had been
courteous and receptive to courtesy.

123
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:12,870
You had established trust, with
the embarrassing truth about Miggs.

124
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,750
And now this ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire.

125
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,540
- It won't do.
- I'm only asking you to look at this.

126
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,720
Either you will or you won't.

127
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,630
Yeah. Jack Crawford
must be very busy indeed

128
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,550
if he's recruiting help
from the student body.

129
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,470
Busy hunting that new one: Buffalo Bill.

130
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,850
What a naughty boy he is.

131
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,520
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill?

132
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:44,070
Please tell me.
The newspapers won't say.

133
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,780
It started as a bad joke
in Kansas City Homicide.

134
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:52,000
They said
"This one likes to skin his humps."

135
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:58,710
Why do you think he removes
their skins, Agent Starling?

136
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,090
Thrill me with your acumen.

137
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:07,310
It excites him. Most serial killers keep
some sort of trophies from their victims.

138
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,520
- I didn't.
- No. No, you ate yours.

139
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,320
You send that through now.

140
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:48,420
Oh, Agent Starling, you think you can
dissect me with this blunt little tool?

141
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,510
No. I thought that your knowledge...

142
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,890
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

143
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,890
Do you know what you look like, with
your good bag and your cheap shoes?

144
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,100
You look like a rube.

145
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,310
A well-scrubbed, hustling rube,
with a little taste.

146
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,440
Good nutrition's given you length of bone,

147
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:12,820
but you're not more than one generation
from poor white trash, are you?

148
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,950
And that accent you've tried so
desperately to shed: Pure West Virginia.

149
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,250
What is your father, dear? Is he
a coal miner? Does he stink of the lamp?

150
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,130
How quickly the boys found you.

151
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,880
All those tedious, sticky fumblings
in the back seats of cars,

152
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:32,520
while you could only dream of
getting out, getting anywhere,

153
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,810
getting all the way to the FBI.

154
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,530
You see a lot, Doctor.

155
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:48,750
But are you strong enough to point
that high-powered perception at yourself?

156
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:54,540
What about it? Why don't you look at
yourself and write down what you see?

157
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,130
Or maybe you're afraid to.

158
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,060
A census taker once tried to test me.

159
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,470
I ate his liver with some fava beans

160
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,060
and a nice Chianti.

161
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,860
You fly back to school now, little Starling.

162
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,570
Fly, fly, fly.

163
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,800
I bit my wrist so I can die.

164
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,180
Look at the blood!

165
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:55,220
- Got ya!
- Miggs, you stupid fuck!

166
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,060
- I'm gonna kill him!
- Agent Starling! Come back!

167
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:05,100
Agent Starling! Agent Starling!
I would not have had that happen to you.

168
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,270
- Discourtesy is unspeakably ugly.
- Then do this test.

169
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,540
No, but I'll give you a chance
for what you love most.

170
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,500
- And what is that?
- Advancement. Listen carefully.

171
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,250
Look deep within yourself,
Clarice Starling.

172
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,250
Go seek out Miss Mofet,
an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T.

173
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:26,590
I don't think Miggs could manage again
so soon, even though he is crazy. Go!

174
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,550
Hey, Bill.

175
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,850
- Daddy!
- Hey, Clarice.

176
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,650
- Did you get any bad guys today, Daddy?
- No, angel. They all got away today.

177
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,250
FBI. Hands up. Don't move.

178
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,340
Turn around.
Hands behind your back. Thumbs up.

179
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,230
You're dead, Starling.

180
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,490
Johnson, good entry, good command.
Starling, where's your danger area?

181
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,030
- The corner.
- Did you check?

182
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,870
- No.
- That's why you're dead.

183
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,240
3109.

184
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,620
3109. Breaking doors or windows

185
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,580
to enter or exit.

186
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,080
Rule 404.

187
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,140
- Clarice, phone. It's the guru.
- Crawford? Thanks, Ardelia.

188
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,100
- Starling?
- Sir?

189
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,640
Miggs is dead.

190
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,520
Dead?

191
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,110
How?

192
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,770
They heard Lecter whispering to him
all afternoon and Miggs crying.

193
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,070
They found him at bed check.
He'd swallowed his own tongue.

194
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,870
- Starling?
- Yeah. I'm still here, sir.

195
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,170
I just... I don't know how to feel about this.

196
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:09,300
You don't have to feel any way about it.
Lecter did it to amuse himself.

197
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:15,180
Look, I know it got ugly today, but
you mentioned a name at the end: Mofet.

198
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,760
Any follow-up on her?

199
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:21,170
Lecter altered or destroyed
most of his patients' histories,

200
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,810
so there's no record
of anyone named Mofet, but

201
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,180
I thought the "yourself" reference
was too hokey for Lecter,

202
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,370
so I figured he's from Baltimore
and I looked in the phone book

203
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:39,500
and there's a "Your Self" storage facility
right outside of downtown Baltimore, sir.

204
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,630
Unit 31 was leased for ten years,
pre-paid in full.

205
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,760
The contract is in the name
of a Miss Hester Mofet.

206
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,510
So nobody's been in here since 1980?

207
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,930
Not to my knowledge.

208
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,850
Privacy is a great concern
to my customers.

209
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:08,360
Yes. I won't disturb anything, I promise.
I'll be outta here before you know it.

210
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,780
- May I help you?
- Yes, actually.

211
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,240
- It's stuck.
- We could return tomorrow with my son.

212
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,160
What about him?

213
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:29,090
I would ask my driver to help you,
but he detests physical labour.

214
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:34,010
Right. Well, you just stay here.
I'll be back in one minute.

215
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,380
It's stuck. Hand me that flashlight, sir.

216
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:28,150
If this door should fall down
or anything else,

217
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,700
this is the number for
our Baltimore field office.

218
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,740
Now they know that you're with me.
Call them if anything should happen.

219
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:39,330
Yes, Miss Starling.

220
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:13,310
Clarice. They're waiting for you.
Watch your step.

221
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,060
Hester Mofet. It's an anagram,
isn't it, Doctor?

222
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,320
Hester Mofet. "The rest of me."

223
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,860
"Miss the rest of me."
Meaning that you rented that garage?

224
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,080
- Thank you.
- Your bleeding has stopped.

225
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,580
How did you...?

226
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,460
It's nothing. It was just a scratch.

227
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,800
Dr Lecter, whose head is in that bottle?

228
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,180
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?

229
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:26,440
- Do you know something about him?
- I might if I saw the case file.

230
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,140
- You could get that for me.
- Why don't we talk about Miss Mofet?

231
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,560
You wanted me to find him.

232
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:38,110
His real name is Benjamin Raspail,
a former patient of mine,

233
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,820
whose romantic attachments ran to,
shall we say, the exotic.

234
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:47,540
I did not kill him, merely tucked him
away very much as I found him,

235
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:51,330
after he'd missed three appointments.

236
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:56,880
- If you didn't kill him, then who did, sir?
- Who can say? Best thing for him, really.

237
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,410
His therapy was going nowhere.

238
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,590
His dress, make-up...

239
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:07,590
- Raspail was a transvestite?
- In life? Oh, no.

240
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,610
Garden-variety manic-depressive.
Tedious, very tedious.

241
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,190
I now just think of him
as a kind of experiment.

242
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,940
A fledgling killer's
first effort at transformation.

243
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,950
How did you feel
when you saw him, Clarice?

244
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:26,670
Scared at first, then exhilarated.

245
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:33,000
Jack Crawford is helping your career.
Apparently he likes you and you like him.

246
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,170
I never thought about it.

247
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,090
Do you think Jack Crawford
wants you, sexually?

248
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:43,430
True, he is much older, but do you think
he visualizes scenarios, exchanges,

249
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,010
fucking you?

250
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:53,810
That doesn't interest me and, frankly,
it's the sort of thing that Miggs would say.

251
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:57,400
Not any more.

252
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,570
Thank you, Barney.

253
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,200
What happened to your drawings?

254
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:17,660
Punishment, you see, for Miggs.
Just like that gospel program.

255
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,800
When you leave,
they'll turn the volume way up.

256
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:24,260
Dr Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.

257
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:28,590
What did you mean
by "transformation", Doctor?

258
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,980
I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice.

259
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:44,190
I know they will never ever
let me out while I'm alive.

260
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,530
What I want is a view.

261
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,540
I want a window where I can
see a tree, or even water.

262
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:54,170
I want to be in a federal institution
far away from Dr Chilton.

263
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,960
What did you mean by "fledgling killer"?
Are you saying that he's killed again?

264
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:04,800
I'm offering you a psychological profile of
Buffalo Bill, based on the case evidence.

265
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:12,440
I'll help you catch him, Clarice.

266
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,360
You know who he is, don't you?

267
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,820
Tell me who decapitated
your patient, Doctor.

268
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,990
All good things to those who wait.

269
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,540
I've waited, Clarice, but how long
can you and old Jackie Boy wait?

270
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,290
Our little Billy must already be
searching for that next special lady.

271
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,570
Hey, little cheeper.

272
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,040
I'll be right there.

273
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,480
Can I help you with that?

274
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,230
- Would you?
- Sure.

275
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,150
- Thank you.
- You look kinda handicapped.

276
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,830
Yeah. I got it this far. I just can't
get it up in the truck by myself.

277
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,210
- Here. Grab this.
- OK.

278
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:39,820
Just set it down. That's good.

279
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,010
Get in the truck.
I wanna push it all the way up.

280
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:47,710
I really appreciate this.
Thank you. Thank you.

281
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,220
Push it all the way back.

282
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:54,010
- Is this good?
- Yeah.

283
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,930
- That's great.
- OK.

284
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,600
Say, are you about a size 14?

285
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,770
Sorry?

286
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,140
Good.

287
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,700
Oh, good.

288
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,860
Good.

289
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,930
Starling!

290
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,850
Outside. Let's go.

291
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:27,400
Cindy. In the ring for Starling. Let's go.

292
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,870
FBI!

293
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,570
Pack your field gear.
You're going with Crawford.

294
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,860
- Where?
- They found a girl's body.

295
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,870
Been in the water a week.
It's a Buffalo Bill situation.

296
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,980
He keeps them alive for three days.
We don't know why.

297
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:03,150
No evidence of rape
or physical abuse prior to death.

298
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,570
All the mutilation
you see there is postmortem.

299
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,740
OK, three days. Then he shoots them,

300
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:14,250
skins them and dumps them,
each body in a different river.

301
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:17,460
The water leaves us
no trace evidence of any kind.

302
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:20,040
That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one.

303
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,210
Her body was the only one
he took the trouble to weight down,

304
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:26,210
so actually she was the third girl found.

305
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,380
After her, he got lazy.

306
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,140
OK, let's see.

307
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,930
Circles where the girls were abducted.
Arrows where their bodies were found.

308
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:42,810
This new one today washed up here.
Elk River, West Virginia.

309
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,290
Look at him, Starling.
Tell me what you see.

310
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:11,760
He's a white male. Serial killers tend
to hunt within their own ethnic groups.

311
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:16,590
He's not a drifter. He's got his own
house somewhere, not an apartment.

312
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,090
- Why?
- What he does with them takes privacy.

313
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:24,770
He's in his thirties or forties.
He's got real physical strength,

314
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,600
combined with
an older man's self-control.

315
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,890
He's cautious, precise...

316
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,080
And he's never impulsive.
He'll never stop.

317
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,910
Why not?

318
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:41,420
Got a real taste for it now
and he's getting better at his work.

319
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,050
Not bad, Starling. Questions?

320
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,670
Yes, sir. You haven't mentioned anything
about the information in my report

321
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,960
or Dr Lecter's offer, sir.

322
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:57,810
- I'm considering it.
- That's why you sent me in there, isn't it?

323
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,860
To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?

324
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:08,770
Well, if that was the case, then
I just wish I was in on it, that's all.

325
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,240
If I'd sent you in with an actual agenda,
Lecter would have known it instantly.

326
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:17,120
He would have toyed with you
then turned to stone.

327
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:53,820
Excuse me, Sheriff Perkins.
These are the FBI people.

328
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:58,030
Sheriff Perkins - Jack Crawford, FBI.
Special Agent Terry.

329
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,860
Agent Starling. We appreciate
being invited into your jurisdiction.

330
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:05,450
I didn't call you. That was
the state attorney's office.

331
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,710
- We'll extend you every courtesy, but...
- Sheriff.

332
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,760
This type of sex crime has certain aspects
I'd just as soon discuss in private.

333
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,930
Know what I mean?

334
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:10,710
- Oscar, fetch Dr Akins from the chapel.
- Starling, we're back here.

335
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,210
Tell Lamar to come on
when he's finished playing his music.

336
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,600
Yeah, we'll be sending in a minute.

337
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,760
I need a six-way linkup.

338
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:23,970
Chicago, Detroit...

339
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,150
What?

340
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:33,850
Excuse me. Excuse me, gentlemen.
You officers and gentlemen,

341
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:36,690
listen here now.
There's things we need to do for her.

342
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:41,450
I know that y'all brought her this far and
her folks would thank you if they could

343
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,820
for your kindness and your sensitivity.

344
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,290
But now please go on now
and let us take care of her.

345
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:50,250
Go on now.

346
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,670
Thank you.

347
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,590
Thank you.

348
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,840
OK, good.

349
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,150
Yeah, that's right. Elk River.

350
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,730
Stand by for transmission.

351
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,190
Ray.

352
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,090
Doctor, Lamar, let's take a look at her.

353
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,080
OK, Starling.

354
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,630
Bill.

355
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:29,350
Star-shaped contact entrance wound
over the sternum.

356
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,560
A muzzle stamp at the top.

357
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,850
Wrongful death.

358
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:40,450
She'll have to go to
the state pathologist at Claxton.

359
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:44,780
Well, I'd better get back to that service.
Lamar'll help you.

360
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:46,950
Lord Almighty.

361
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,040
What else do you see, Starling?

362
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:56,630
Well, she's not local.

363
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:03,010
Her ears are pierced three times
and there's glitter nail polish.

364
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,590
That looks like town to me.

365
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:16,860
Two of her fingernails are broken off
and there's dirt or grit under them.

366
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:20,490
It looks like she's tried
to claw her way through something.

367
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:25,280
Ray, get pictures of her teeth.
We'll fax 'em for Missing Persons.

368
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:36,590
Let's do another.

369
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:47,810
She's got something in her throat.

370
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:52,810
When a body comes out of the water,
lots of times there's leaves in the mouth.

371
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:27,220
What is that? Some kind of seed pod?

372
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:30,260
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.

373
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:33,680
There's no way that could
get way down in there.

374
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:36,730
Not unless somebody shoved it in there.

375
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:42,610
She'll be easier to print when we turn
her over. Lamar, give me a hand.

376
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,780
Yes, sir. I will.

377
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:54,460
- Oh, Jack. What do you make of these?
- Different configuration than the others.

378
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:57,260
- Get close-ups.
- The victim's skin removed,

379
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:00,920
this time in two large diamond-shaped
sections above the buttocks.

380
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,640
Exit wound level with the second
or the third thoracic vertebrae,

381
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:07,340
six inches from the right shoulder blade.

382
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:13,230
Starling, when I told that sheriff
we shouldn't talk in front of a woman,

383
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,400
that really burned you, didn't it?

384
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:19,110
It was just smoke, Starling.
I had to get rid of him.

385
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:23,530
It matters, Mr Crawford.
Cops look at you to see how to act.

386
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:26,120
- It matters.
- Point taken.

387
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:36,630
Ligature marks found around the wrists,
not around the ankles.

388
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,800
This would indicate that
the skinning was postmortem.

389
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:06,480
- Time, Pilch. My move.
- You lured him with produce.

390
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:10,110
Tough noogies. It's still my turn.

391
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,530
Nice and slow, baby.

392
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:16,580
If the beetle moves one of your men,
does that still count?

393
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,830
Course it counts. How do you play?

394
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,790
Agent Starling?

395
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:27,580
Where the heck did this come from?
It's practically mush.

396
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:32,230
It was found behind the soft palate
of a murder victim in the Elk River.

397
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,440
- It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?
- I can't tell you any more.

398
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:39,150
- We heard about it on the radio.
- This is a clue from a real murder case?

399
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,950
- Cool.
- Just ignore him. He's not a PhD.

400
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:46,320
Sphingid ceratomia, maybe.

401
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:49,210
Boy, he's a big sucker.

402
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:53,160
OK. Let's check morphology.

403
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:06,010
What do you do when you're
not detecting, Agent Starling?

404
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,600
I try to be a student, Dr Pilcher.

405
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:12,430
Ever go out for cheeseburgers and beer?

406
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,770
The amusing house wine?

407
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:17,430
Are you hitting on me, Doctor?

408
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:18,650
Yes.

409
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,570
- Gotcha.
- What have you got?

410
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:25,610
Agent Starling, meet Mr Acherontia styx.

411
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,110
Weird.

412
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:30,450
Better known to his friends
as the death's-head moth.

413
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:34,740
- Where does it come from?
- It's strange. They only live in Asia.

414
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,710
Here they'd have to be
raised from imported eggs.

415
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:43,840
Somebody grew this guy. Fed him honey
and nightshade, kept him warm.

416
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:46,540
Somebody loved him.

417
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:21,970
Where are you?

418
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:24,970
Let me outta here!

419
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:27,970
Help me!

420
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:33,350
Please!

421
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,940
Please help me.

422
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,150
Please!

423
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,820
Why won't you answer me? Please!

424
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:50,120
- Good morning. I'm Donna Feruchi.
- I'm Gene Cassel with sports.

425
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:53,670
And I'm Tim Langhorn.
Our top story for this morning.

426
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:57,620
Catherine Martin, the 25-year-old
daughter of Senator Ruth Martin,

427
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:01,090
listed as missing, is now
believed to have been kidnapped

428
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:04,080
by the serial killer
known only as Buffalo Bill.

429
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:07,750
Police indicate that the girl's
blouse has been identified,

430
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:12,510
sliced up the back, in what has become
a grim, all-too-familiar calling card.

431
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,420
Young Catherine Martin is the only
daughter of Senator Ruth Martin,

432
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,800
the Republican senator from Tennessee.

433
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:22,390
Her kidnapping is not considered
to be politically motivated,

434
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,690
but it has stirred
the government to its highest levels.

435
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:30,360
Reached for comment on the ski slopes
of Vermont, the president is said to be,

436
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:32,700
and I quote, "intensely concerned".

437
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:37,400
Just moments ago Senator Martin
taped this dramatic personal plea.

438
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:42,000
I'm speaking now to the person
who is holding my daughter.

439
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:45,540
Catherine is very gentle and kind.

440
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,920
Talk to her and you'll see.

441
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:53,100
You have the power. You are in charge.

442
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,770
I know you can feel love and compassion.

443
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:05,070
You have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world

444
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,730
that you can be merciful
as well as strong,

445
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:14,110
that you're big enough to treat Catherine
better than the world has treated you.

446
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:16,320
You have that power.

447
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,530
Please.

448
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:20,630
My daughter is Catherine.

449
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:24,590
Boy, that's smart.
Jesus, that's really smart.

450
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,960
She keeps repeating the name.

451
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:33,010
If he sees Catherine as a person and not
just an object, it's harder to tear her up.

452
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:35,550
Release my little girl.

453
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:39,220
You're coming into my hospital
to conduct an interview

454
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,270
and refusing to share information
with me for the third time.

455
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,690
Sir, I told you, this is just a routine
follow-up on the Raspail case.

456
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:51,320
- He is my patient. I have rights.
- I understand that, sir.

457
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:55,990
Look, I am not just
some turnkey, Miss Starling.

458
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,120
This is the number
for the US attorney's office.

459
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:05,590
Either you discuss this with him or you
let me do my job, do you understand?

460
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:15,710
If your profile helps us catch Buffalo Bill
in time to save Catherine Martin,

461
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:18,300
the senator promises you a transfer

462
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:22,680
to the VA hospital at Oneida Park, New
York, with a view of the woods nearby.

463
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:25,810
Maximum security still applies, of course.

464
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:29,220
You'd have reasonable access to books.

465
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,610
Best of all, though,

466
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:35,880
one week of the year,
you get to leave the hospital

467
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,040
and go here.

468
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,580
Plum Island.

469
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:48,430
Every day of that week you may walk on
the beach, you may swim in the ocean,

470
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:53,220
for up to one hour, under SWAT team
surveillance, of course.

471
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,390
And there you have it.

472
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:02,020
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.

473
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:05,980
A copy of the senator's offer.

474
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:10,030
This offer is non-negotiable and final.

475
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,240
Catherine Martin dies, you get nothing.

476
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,490
"Plum Island Animal Disease
Research Center."

477
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,540
Sounds charming.

478
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,290
That's only a part of the island.
There's a very nice beach.

479
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:39,050
- Terns nest there. There's beautiful...
- Terns?

480
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:44,180
If I help you, Clarice,
it will be "turns" with us too.

481
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:47,400
Suid pro quo. I tell you things,
you tell me things.

482
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,280
Not about this case, though.
About yourself.

483
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,440
Suid pro quo. Yes or no?

484
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:59,480
Yes or no, Clarice?
Poor little Catherine is waiting.

485
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,990
Go, Doctor.

486
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,870
What is your worst memory of childhood?

487
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:10,300
The death of my father.

488
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:13,470
Tell me about it and don't lie, or I'll know.

489
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,600
He was a town marshal.

490
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:21,140
One night he surprised two burglars

491
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,730
coming out the back of a drugstore.

492
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:27,030
They shot him.

493
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,310
Was he killed outright?

494
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:33,400
No, he was very strong.
He lasted more than a month.

495
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:37,570
My mother died when I was very young.

496
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:43,790
My father had become the whole world to
me, and, when he left me, I had nothing.

497
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,160
I was ten years old.

498
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:49,630
You're very frank, Clarice.

499
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,590
I think it would be quite something
to know you in private life.

500
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:59,090
Suid pro quo, Doctor.

501
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:03,800
So tell me about Miss West Virginia.
Was she a large girl?

502
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:10,020
- Yes.
- Big through the hips? Roomy?

503
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:13,360
- They all were.
- What else?

504
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:17,530
She had an object deliberately
inserted into her throat.

505
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:22,160
Now, that hasn't been made public yet.
We don't know what it means.

506
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:25,240
Was it a butterfly?

507
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,410
Yes. A moth.

508
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:34,130
Just like the one we found
in Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.

509
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:37,090
Why does he place them there, Doctor?

510
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:41,170
The significance of the moth is change.

511
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:44,760
Caterpillar into chrysalis, or pupa,

512
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:47,840
and from thence into beauty.

513
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,940
Our Billy wants to change, too.

514
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:54,820
There's no correlation between
transsexualism and violence.

515
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:58,200
- Transsexuals are very passive.
- Clever girl.

516
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:02,000
You're so close to the way you're
gonna catch him, do you realise that?

517
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:04,620
No. Tell me why.

518
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:09,710
After your father's murder you were
orphaned. What happened next?

519
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:17,010
I don't imagine the answer is
on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.

520
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:22,730
I lived with my mother's cousin and her
husband in Montana. They had a ranch.

521
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:26,310
- Was it a cattle ranch?
- Sheep and horses.

522
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:30,230
- How long did you live there?
- Two months.

523
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,820
- Why so briefly?
- I ran away.

524
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:37,900
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher
make you perform fellatio?

525
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,570
Did he sodomize you?

526
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:44,200
No. He was a very decent man.

527
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:48,000
Suid pro quo, Doctor.

528
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:54,050
Billy is not a real transsexual.
But he thinks he is. He tries to be.

529
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:57,340
He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.

530
00:56:57,470 --> 00:57:01,300
You said that I was very close to the way
we would catch him. What did you mean?

531
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:04,970
There are three centers for
transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins,

532
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:08,520
the University of Minnesota
and Columbus Medical Center.

533
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:13,440
I wouldn't be surprised if Billy had applied
for sex reassignment at all of them

534
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:15,940
and been rejected.

535
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:18,770
On what basis would they reject him?

536
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:23,450
Look for severe childhood disturbances
associated with violence.

537
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:26,530
Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice.

538
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:30,840
He was made one through years
of systematic abuse.

539
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:34,390
Billy hates his own identity, you see,

540
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:37,300
and he thinks
that makes him a transsexual.

541
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,430
But his pathology is
a thousand times more savage

542
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:44,020
and more terrifying.

543
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:51,400
It rubs the lotion on its skin.
It does this whenever it's told.

544
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:57,370
Mister, my family will pay cash. Whatever
ransom you're asking for, they'll pay it.

545
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:02,070
It rubs the lotion on its skin
or else it gets the hose again.

546
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:07,580
Yes, it will, Precious. It will get the hose.

547
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,750
OK, OK.

548
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:21,050
Mister, if you let me go,
I won't press charges, I promise.

549
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:24,880
See, my mom is a real important woman.

550
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,220
I guess you already know that.

551
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:30,560
Now it places the lotion in the basket.

552
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:32,100
Please!

553
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:34,730
Please!

554
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:38,810
I wanna go home, please!

555
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:41,270
It places the lotion in the basket.

556
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,280
I wanna see my mommy!

557
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:46,950
Please!

558
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,120
I wanna see my...

559
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:53,540
I wanna see my mommy.

560
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:56,710
Put the fucking lotion in the basket!

561
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:36,620
You still think you're gonna walk
on some beach and see the birdies?

562
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:39,380
I don't think so.

563
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:42,000
I called Senator Ruth Martin.

564
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:44,810
She never heard of any deal with you.

565
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:48,360
They scammed you, Hannibal.

566
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:52,060
Stand outside.

567
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,770
And shut the door.

568
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:06,330
There never was a deal with
Senator Martin, but there is now.

569
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:11,580
I designed it. Of course, I worked in a few
conditions for my own benefit as well.

570
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:17,080
Identify Buffalo Bill by name
and, if the girl is found in time,

571
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:22,630
Senator Martin will have you transferred
to the state prison in Tennessee.

572
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,550
Answer me, Hannibal.

573
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:31,220
You answer me now or, by God,
you'll never leave this cell.

574
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:35,180
Who is Buffalo Bill?

575
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,730
His first name is Louis.

576
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:42,270
I'll tell the rest to the senator herself,
but only in Tennessee.

577
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,270
And I have a few conditions of my own.

578
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:49,860
Clean him up and get him ready to go.

579
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:54,130
Jack, Hannibal Lecter's
being transferred to Memphis.

580
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:55,590
Transferred?

581
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:00,180
Did you have a trainee make a phoney
offer to Lecter in the senator's name?

582
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:02,430
Yeah, I rolled the dice. I had to.

583
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,640
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.
Paul Krendler's over here from Justice.

584
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:09,690
She's asking him
to take over in Memphis.

585
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:38,960
Welcome to Memphis. I'm Lieutenant
Boyle. This is Sergeant Patrick.

586
01:01:39,090 --> 01:01:41,170
We'll treat you as good as you treat us.

587
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:45,470
You be a gentleman, you're gonna
get three hots and a cot.

588
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:49,640
Sir. You sign right here,
we'll have us a legal transfer.

589
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:53,650
Where's...?

590
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:56,810
Here, sir. Use mine.

591
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:47,660
Senator Martin, Dr Hannibal Lecter.

592
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:58,420
Dr Lecter, I brought an affidavit
guaranteeing your new rights.

593
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:01,590
You'll wanna read it before I sign.

594
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:09,180
I won't waste your time or Catherine's
time, bargaining for petty privileges.

595
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:13,600
Clarice Starling and that awful Jack
Crawford have wasted far too much time.

596
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:17,180
I only pray they haven't
doomed the poor girl.

597
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:21,440
Let me help you now and I will
trust you when it is all over.

598
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:24,030
You have my word. Paul?

599
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:28,740
Buffalo Bill's real name is Louis Friend.

600
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:34,110
I met him just once. He was referred
to me in April or May 1980

601
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:37,040
by my patient, Benjamin Raspail.

602
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:39,330
They were lovers, you see.

603
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:43,540
But Raspail had become very frightened.

604
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:47,120
Apparently, Louis had
murdered a transient

605
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:50,510
and done things with the skin.

606
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:55,380
We need his address
and a physical description.

607
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:00,230
Tell me, Senator. Did you
nurse Catherine yourself?

608
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:03,060
- What?
- Did you breast-feed her?

609
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:05,860
- Now, wait a minute.
- Yes, I did.

610
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:09,860
- Toughened your nipples, didn't it?
- You son of a bitch!

611
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:13,780
Amputate a man's leg
and he can still feel it tickling.

612
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:19,000
Tell me, Mom, when your little girl
is on the slab, where will it tickle you?

613
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:22,880
Take this thing back to Baltimore.

614
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:27,270
Five foot ten, strongly built,
about 180 pounds.

615
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:30,060
Hair blond, eyes pale blue.

616
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:34,600
He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived
in Philadelphia but may have lied.

617
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:40,690
That's all I can remember, Mom, but if
I think of any more, I will let you know.

618
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:44,230
And, Senator, just one more thing.

619
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:49,150
Love your suit.

620
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:53,830
In a meeting this evening
with Senator Ruth Martin,

621
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:57,080
Dr Lecter agreed
to assist in the investigation

622
01:04:57,210 --> 01:05:00,160
of trying to find the abductor, Buffalo Bill.

623
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:03,050
- How do you fit in?
- My insight into Lecter's mind

624
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:06,620
- made this breakthrough possible.
- Buffalo Bill's real name?

625
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:10,260
That is now a matter of record
with the proper authorities.

626
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:14,140
- My name is Dr Frederick Chilton.
- How do you spell that?

627
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:20,560
- Are you with Dr Chilton's group?
- Well, I just saw him outside, sir.

628
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:24,110
Access to Lecter is limited.
We've been getting death threats.

629
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:26,690
I understand, sir.

630
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:34,490
Log in and check your weapon.

631
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:38,990
I can't take all the credit.
Senator Martin, the Justice Department,

632
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:42,160
people at the FBI, folks
at the Baltimore state hospital.

633
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:45,660
And now for the hard part:
Apprehending the suspect.

634
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:49,410
Excuse me, folks.
I'm gonna have to catch a flight.

635
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,320
Is it true what they're saying?

636
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,400
He's some kind of vampire?

637
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:14,740
They don't have a name for what he is.

638
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,280
You do know the rules, ma'am?

639
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:21,200
Yes, Lieutenant Boyle.
I've questioned him before.

640
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:25,380
Go ahead.

641
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:03,870
Good evening, Clarice.

642
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:09,170
I thought you might like
your drawings back, Doctor.

643
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,250
Just until you get your view.

644
01:07:13,390 --> 01:07:16,060
How very thoughtful.

645
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:19,430
Or did Jack Crawford send you
for one last wheedle

646
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:22,180
before you're both booted off the case?

647
01:07:22,310 --> 01:07:25,060
No, I came because I wanted to.

648
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:31,570
People will say we're in love.

649
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:38,290
Anthrax Island.

650
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:41,510
That was an especially
nice touch, Clarice.

651
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:44,380
- Yours?
- Yes.

652
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:46,670
Yeah.

653
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:50,590
That was good.
Pity about poor Catherine, though.

654
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:53,340
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

655
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,680
Your anagrams are showing, Doctor.

656
01:07:56,810 --> 01:07:58,930
Louis Friend?

657
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:02,180
Iron sulfide, also known as fool's gold.

658
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:06,520
Oh, Clarice, your problem is
you need to get more fun out of life.

659
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:12,070
You were telling me the truth back in
Baltimore, sir. Please continue now.

660
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,990
I've read the case files. Have you?

661
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:18,160
Everything you need to find him
is there in those pages.

662
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:23,080
- Then tell me how.
- First principles, Clarice. Simplicity.

663
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:28,340
Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each
particular thing, ask what is it in itself?

664
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:30,540
What is its nature?

665
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:34,590
What does he do, this man you seek?

666
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:40,480
- He kills women.
- No. That is incidental.

667
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:46,600
What is the first thing he does?
What needs does he serve by killing?

668
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:49,190
Anger.

669
01:08:50,070 --> 01:08:52,110
Social acceptance.

670
01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:57,820
- Sexual frustrations.
- No. He covets.

671
01:08:58,790 --> 01:09:03,110
That is his nature.
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?

672
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:06,910
Do we seek out things to covet?

673
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,080
Make an effort to answer now.

674
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:11,840
No. We just...

675
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:15,310
No, we begin by coveting
what we see every day.

676
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:18,720
Don't you feel eyes
moving over your body, Clarice?

677
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:22,850
And don't your eyes seek out
the things you want?

678
01:09:23,650 --> 01:09:26,230
All right, yes. Now please tell me how...

679
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:30,230
No. It is your turn to tell me, Clarice.

680
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:33,530
You don't have any more
vacations to sell.

681
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:36,280
Why did you leave that ranch?

682
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:40,580
Doctor, we don't have
any more time for any of this now.

683
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:43,280
But we don't reckon time
the same way, do we?

684
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:47,750
- This is all the time you'll ever have.
- Later. Listen to me. We've only got five...

685
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:51,220
No. I will listen now.

686
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:56,470
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.

687
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:00,300
You went to live with cousins on
a sheep and horse ranch in Montana.

688
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,480
And?

689
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:05,890
And one morning I just ran away.

690
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:10,270
Not "just", Clarice. What set you off?

691
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:14,020
- You started at what time?
- Early. Still dark.

692
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:18,110
Then something woke you, didn't it?
Was it a dream? What was it?

693
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:22,450
I heard a strange noise.

694
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:24,570
What was it?

695
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:27,910
It was screaming.

696
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:33,250
Some kind of screaming.
Like a child's voice.

697
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:35,340
What did you do?

698
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:38,090
I went downstairs.

699
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:40,260
Outside.

700
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:44,470
I crept up into the barn.

701
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:48,470
I was so scared to look inside,
but I had to.

702
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:52,240
What did you see, Clarice?
What did you see?

703
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:56,070
Lambs.

704
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:58,280
They were screaming.

705
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,170
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?

706
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:04,620
And they were screaming.

707
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:09,630
- And you ran away?
- No. First I tried to free them.

708
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,510
I opened the gate to their pen,
but they wouldn't run.

709
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:17,340
They just stood there, confused.
They wouldn't run.

710
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:20,510
But you could - and you did, didn't you?

711
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:24,340
Yes. I took one lamb
and I ran away as fast as I could.

712
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:28,780
- Where were you going, Clarice?
- I don't know. I didn't have any food,

713
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:32,190
any water and it was very cold, very cold.

714
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,360
I thought...

715
01:11:36,490 --> 01:11:39,580
I thought if I could save just one, but...

716
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,570
He was so heavy.

717
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:45,750
So heavy.

718
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:55,340
I didn't get more than a few miles
when the sheriff's car picked me up.

719
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:02,550
The rancher was so angry, he sent me
to live at the orphanage in Bozeman.

720
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,920
I never saw the ranch again.

721
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:08,100
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

722
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:13,890
- He killed him.
- You still wake up sometimes, don't you?

723
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:16,520
Wake up in the dark

724
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:19,400
and hear the screaming of the lambs?

725
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:22,030
Yes.

726
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:26,910
And you think, if you save poor Catherine,
you could make them stop, don't you?

727
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,200
You think if Catherine lives,

728
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:32,710
you won't wake up in the dark ever again

729
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:35,680
to that awful screaming of the lambs.

730
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:38,260
I don't know.

731
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:40,810
I don't know.

732
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,980
Thank you, Clarice.

733
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:49,110
- Thank you.
- Tell me his name, Doctor.

734
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:58,030
Dr Chilton, I presume.

735
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:00,620
I think you know each other.

736
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,120
OK.

737
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:08,450
- Let's go.
- It's your turn, Doctor.

738
01:13:08,590 --> 01:13:10,660
- Out.
- Tell me his name.

739
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,930
Sorry, ma'am. I've got orders. I have
to put you on a plane. Come on now.

740
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:17,340
Brave Clarice.

741
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:21,050
You will let me know when those lambs
stop screaming, won't you?

742
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:25,730
- Tell me his name, Doctor.
- Clarice.

743
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:28,560
Your case file.

744
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:35,490
Goodbye, Clarice.

745
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:44,270
- Ready when you are, doc.
- Just another minute, please.

746
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:57,940
Son of a bitch demanded a second
dinner. Lamb chops, extra rare.

747
01:14:58,070 --> 01:15:02,900
I wonder what he wants for breakfast.
Some damn thing from the zoo?

748
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:27,890
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- OK, doc. Grab some floor.

749
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:30,060
Same drill as before, please.

750
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:39,690
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

751
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,760
OK.

752
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:05,770
Hand me that, would ya?

753
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:13,110
Thanks.

754
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:18,860
Mind the drawings, please.

755
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:23,110
Thank you.

756
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:49,470
Watch it. He's cuffed me!

757
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:58,060
Jesus Christ!

758
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,100
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

759
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,320
What is this shit?

760
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:36,450
- Did somebody go up on five?
- No. Nobody went up.

761
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:39,700
Call Pembry. Ask him to tell...

762
01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:45,380
CP. Shots fired on five.
Repeat: Shots fired on five.

763
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:47,550
Sergeant Tate.

764
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:52,260
- Holy shit.
- What the hell...?

765
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,090
Shut up. Bobby, get the vest.

766
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:59,060
- Right, sarge.
- Brady, Howard, cover...

767
01:18:59,190 --> 01:19:01,230
Look!

768
01:19:03,190 --> 01:19:07,650
- It's stopped.
- Seal off a ten-block radius.

769
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:10,540
Get me the SWAT team
and an ambulance double-quick.

770
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:12,630
We're going up.

771
01:19:41,070 --> 01:19:43,150
Pembry!

772
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:46,160
Boyle!

773
01:19:58,590 --> 01:20:00,830
Oh, God.

774
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:09,050
Go.

775
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:19,140
- Clear.
- Command post.

776
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:21,730
Two officers down.

777
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:26,270
- Lecter's gone, sarge.
- Prisoner is missing.

778
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:30,860
- Boyle's gun is gone, Sergeant.
- Repeat: Lecter is missing and armed.

779
01:20:30,990 --> 01:20:35,370
He's stripped the bed. Might be
making a rope. Check all windows.

780
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:38,400
Where the fuck is my ambulance?

781
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:43,250
He's alive. Sergeant Tate, he's alive.

782
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:47,170
Get a hold of him
and feel his hand. Talk to him.

783
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:51,090
- What do I say?
- It's Jim Pembry. Talk to him, dammit!

784
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,560
Lecter is missing and armed.

785
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:56,900
Pembry, can you hear me?

786
01:20:57,030 --> 01:21:01,940
He took Boyle's gun. Pembry got off one
round. There's a chance Lecter was hit.

787
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:05,900
Keep breathing in and out.
That's it. You're doing a good job.

788
01:21:06,030 --> 01:21:08,410
You look real good.

789
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:11,410
Yeah, you look real good.

790
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:30,260
- You ready?
- Let's do it.

791
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:32,430
Let's go.

792
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:46,900
Looking good, Pembry. You're gonna
make it. You're doing just fine.

793
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:49,440
I need that IV now!

794
01:21:49,570 --> 01:21:53,650
Can we get the straps?
Where's the fucking oxygen?

795
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:56,240
Stay with me. Stay with me here.

796
01:21:57,290 --> 01:21:59,740
We're losing him. Downstairs.

797
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:02,950
And up.

798
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:05,130
Elevator!

799
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:12,540
CP to Tate.

800
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:15,550
Roger, Lieutenant. Tate here.

801
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:18,640
I'm on the elevator
bringing Pembry down.

802
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:21,260
He seems to be hanging on.

803
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:23,890
Top three floors secured.

804
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:26,060
Main stairwell secured.

805
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:29,150
We think he's on two.

806
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:44,630
Tate, are you still with me?

807
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:51,500
We're pretty sure he's somewhere on two,
sir. That's all for now. Over.

808
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,660
He's on the roof of the elevator.

809
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:17,280
OK, guys.

810
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:34,760
I see him.

811
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:37,180
There's a gun by his hand.
He's not moving.

812
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:40,810
- One warning: We need him alive.
- Got it.

813
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:44,720
Lecter, put your hands on your head.

814
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:49,730
One in the leg.

815
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:02,400
No movement.

816
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,120
Johnny, hold your fire.
We're coming into the car.

817
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:08,540
We're opening the hatch.

818
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:11,880
Watch his hands.
If there's any fire, it'll come from us.

819
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:14,090
- Affirm.
- Got it.

820
01:24:40,210 --> 01:24:42,250
Memphis General, medical unit 26.

821
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:46,790
We're inbound with a male police officer
with severe facial lacerations.

822
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:51,550
Weapon unknown. We've got grand mal
seizure activity but he's post-ictal now.

823
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:54,630
Vital signs are good.
Pressure is 130 over 90.

824
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,170
- 90?
- Yeah, that's right, 90. Pulse 84.

825
01:24:57,310 --> 01:25:02,270
We got him on lactated Ringer's and
the patient is on ten liters of oxygen...

826
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:14,530
They found the ambulance in a parking
garage at the airport. Crew was dead.

827
01:25:14,990 --> 01:25:18,740
He killed a tourist, too.
Got his clothes, cash.

828
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:22,410
- By now he could be anywhere.
- He won't come after me.

829
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:24,830
- Oh, really?
- He won't.

830
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:29,500
I can't explain it.
He would consider that rude.

831
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:33,500
- It's over. She's dead.
- It's not your fault it worked out like this.

832
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:38,050
The thing is that Lecter said everything
we need to catch him is in these pages.

833
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:40,670
Dr Lecter said a lot of things.

834
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:43,260
He's here, Ardelia.

835
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,260
Is this Lecter's handwriting?

836
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:20,140
"Clarice, doesn't this random scattering
of sites seem desperately random,

837
01:26:20,270 --> 01:26:24,100
like the elaboration of a bad liar?
Hannibal Lecter."

838
01:26:24,230 --> 01:26:26,940
Desperately random?
What does he mean?

839
01:26:27,070 --> 01:26:31,560
Not random at all, maybe.
Like there's some pattern here.

840
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:34,900
But there is no pattern
or the computers would have nailed it.

841
01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:39,660
- They were even found in random order.
- Random because of the one girl.

842
01:26:39,790 --> 01:26:43,780
- The one he weighted down.
- Fredrica Bimmel.

843
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:47,290
From Belvedere, Ohio.

844
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:50,370
First girl taken, third body found.

845
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:53,420
- Why?
- She didn't drift. He weighted her down.

846
01:26:53,550 --> 01:26:56,920
What did Lecter say
about the first principles?

847
01:26:57,050 --> 01:27:02,210
- Simplicity.
- What does this guy do? He covets.

848
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:04,890
How do we first start to covet?

849
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:08,680
- We covet what we see...
- Every day.

850
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:13,890
- Hot damn, Clarice.
- He knew her.

851
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:31,060
- Mr Bimmel?
- That's me.

852
01:28:32,230 --> 01:28:34,810
I'm Clarice Starling. I'm with the FBI.

853
01:28:38,740 --> 01:28:42,320
I sure appreciate you letting me
take a look around, Mr Bimmel.

854
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:44,690
I don't know nothing new to tell ya.

855
01:28:44,830 --> 01:28:48,250
Police been back here
so many times already.

856
01:28:48,370 --> 01:28:52,540
Fredrica went into Chicago
on the bus to see about a job.

857
01:28:52,670 --> 01:28:56,200
She left the interview OK.
She never come home.

858
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:01,500
Her bedroom's how she left it.

859
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:04,260
Upstairs. Door to the left.

860
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:53,470
He's making himself a "woman suit",
Mr Crawford, out of real women.

861
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:56,140
He can sew, this guy. He's very skilled.

862
01:31:56,270 --> 01:31:58,650
- He's a tailor or a dressmaker.
- Starling...

863
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:02,390
That's why they're so big. He has to
keep them alive so he can starve them,

864
01:32:02,530 --> 01:32:06,190
- so that he can loosen their skin.
- Starling, we know who he is.

865
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,400
And where he is.
We're on our way right now.

866
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:11,490
- Where?
- Calumet City, edge of Chicago.

867
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:14,370
Be on the ground in 45 minutes.

868
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:16,710
That's great news, sir, but how...

869
01:32:16,830 --> 01:32:20,420
Johns Hopkins came up with some
names. We fed 'em into Known Offenders.

870
01:32:20,550 --> 01:32:24,630
Subject's name
is Jamie Gumb, a.k. A John Grant.

871
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:28,460
Lecter's description was accurate.
He just lied about the name.

872
01:32:28,590 --> 01:32:30,850
Customs had some paper on him.

873
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:36,520
They stopped a carton two years ago
at LAX. Live caterpillars from Surinam.

874
01:32:36,660 --> 01:32:39,570
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.

875
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:43,030
Chicago's only 400 miles from here.
I'll be there in...

876
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:47,570
No, Starling. There's not enough time.
We want him for murder, not kidnapping.

877
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:51,750
I need you to link him to the Bimmel girl.
See what you can dredge up in Belvedere.

878
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:54,080
Yes, sir, you bet. I'll do my best.

879
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:57,880
Starling, we wouldn't
have found him without you.

880
01:32:58,010 --> 01:33:01,510
Nobody's gonna forget that.
Least of all me.

881
01:33:02,890 --> 01:33:06,640
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, Mr Crawford.

882
01:33:07,890 --> 01:33:09,300
Mr Crawford?

883
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:24,320
Thanks for the scraps, asshole.

884
01:33:24,450 --> 01:33:26,900
I got a better idea.

885
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:50,630
OK, Precious. Time for a little treat.

886
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:05,360
Precious!

887
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,820
Come on, girl!

888
01:34:09,950 --> 01:34:12,450
Come on, Precious.

889
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:23,590
Come on, Precious!

890
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:27,970
I got a yummy snack for ya!
Come on. Come and get it.

891
01:34:34,940 --> 01:34:37,100
Precious!

892
01:34:37,230 --> 01:34:39,480
Are you up there, you little shit?

893
01:34:40,530 --> 01:34:43,230
Come and get it, pretty girl.

894
01:34:49,870 --> 01:34:53,540
Precious, please come. Come on.

895
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:16,690
Would you fuck me?

896
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:19,350
Come on. Take that bone.

897
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:25,220
I'd fuck me.

898
01:35:26,070 --> 01:35:28,360
Come on.

899
01:35:31,330 --> 01:35:33,370
I'd fuck me hard.

900
01:35:33,490 --> 01:35:35,530
I'd fuck me so hard.

901
01:35:40,210 --> 01:35:41,370
No.

902
01:36:42,570 --> 01:36:46,400
Is that a good job, FBI agent?
You get to travel around and stuff?

903
01:36:46,530 --> 01:36:48,650
I mean, better places than this?

904
01:36:50,450 --> 01:36:52,740
Sometimes you do.

905
01:36:52,870 --> 01:36:57,280
Freddie was so happy for me
when I got this job at the bank.

906
01:36:57,410 --> 01:37:01,460
Toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow
on the speakers all day.

907
01:37:01,590 --> 01:37:04,370
She thought it was such hot shit.

908
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:06,960
What did she know? Big dummy.

909
01:37:07,090 --> 01:37:13,040
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man
named Jamie Gumb or a Jame Gumb?

910
01:37:13,850 --> 01:37:16,140
- How about John Grant?
- No.

911
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:19,100
Would she have had a friend
you didn't know about?

912
01:37:19,230 --> 01:37:21,470
If she had a guy,
I'd have known, believe me.

913
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:25,520
- Sewing was her life.
- Did you two ever work together?

914
01:37:25,650 --> 01:37:30,820
Sure. Me and Pam Malavesi used to help
her do alterations for old Mrs Lippman.

915
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:34,570
Can you give me Mrs Lippman's address?
I need to talk to her.

916
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:05,690
So powerful. So beautiful.

917
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:13,280
Precious?

918
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:21,780
- Precious?
- She's down here, you sack of shit!

919
01:38:30,630 --> 01:38:35,100
- Put her in that bucket.
- Get me a telephone and lower it down.

920
01:38:38,350 --> 01:38:40,680
Poodlie-poo. Precious.

921
01:38:40,810 --> 01:38:45,390
- Darling heart, are you all right?
- She's in a lot of pain. She needs a vet.

922
01:38:49,650 --> 01:38:52,690
She broke her leg
on the way down. I know it.

923
01:38:52,820 --> 01:38:56,690
- Don't you hurt my dog!
- Don't you make me hurt your dog!

924
01:38:56,830 --> 01:38:59,030
You don't know what pain is!

925
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:16,850
- Oh, fuck!
- You better be getting me that telephone!

926
01:39:17,190 --> 01:39:19,640
I'm gonna do it, mister!

927
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:25,850
All right, mister! I'm doing it!

928
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:51,220
OK, I'm coming.

929
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:55,090
We're going in.

930
01:39:59,230 --> 01:40:04,020
Good afternoon. Sorry to bother you.
I'm looking for Mrs Lippman's family.

931
01:40:04,690 --> 01:40:07,260
FBI! Everybody down!

932
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:09,970
No, Lippmans don't live here any more.

933
01:40:10,110 --> 01:40:12,350
Excuse me.
I really need to speak with you.

934
01:40:13,570 --> 01:40:15,320
Clear!

935
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:18,200
What's the problem, officer?

936
01:40:18,330 --> 01:40:21,080
I'm investigating the death
of Fredrica Bimmel.

937
01:40:24,670 --> 01:40:27,120
There's no one here, Jack.

938
01:40:28,710 --> 01:40:29,910
Clarice.

939
01:40:30,050 --> 01:40:32,800
- Your name is?
- Jack Gordon.

940
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:38,080
Mr Gordon. Good. Well, Fredrica used to
work for Mrs Lippman. Did you know her?

941
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:41,170
No. Uh-uh.

942
01:40:41,310 --> 01:40:42,960
Oh, wait.

943
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:45,260
Was she a great, big, fat person?

944
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:49,600
- She was a big girl, sir.
- Yeah, I may have...

945
01:40:49,730 --> 01:40:52,230
No, I read about her in the newspaper.

946
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:56,740
Mrs Lippman had a son.
Maybe he could help you.

947
01:40:56,870 --> 01:40:59,830
I got his card here someplace.
Come in while I look for it.

948
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:02,410
- May I?
- Yeah, sure.

949
01:41:21,310 --> 01:41:24,810
Are you close to catching
somebody, you think?

950
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:26,980
Yes. We may be.

951
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:34,440
Did you take over this place
after Mrs Lippman died, is that right?

952
01:41:36,450 --> 01:41:40,780
Yeah, I bought this house two years ago.

953
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,450
Did she leave any records?
Any business records?

954
01:41:45,580 --> 01:41:48,870
Tax forms? List of employees?

955
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:52,340
No, nothing like that at all.

956
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:57,220
Say, has the FBI learned something?

957
01:41:57,350 --> 01:42:01,180
The police around here
don't seem to have the first clue.

958
01:42:10,270 --> 01:42:16,230
I mean, have you got, like, a description,
fingerprints, anything like that?

959
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:18,400
No.

960
01:42:19,990 --> 01:42:22,030
No, we don't.

961
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:35,010
Here's that number.

962
01:42:35,770 --> 01:42:39,470
Very good, Mr Gordon.
May I use your phone, please?

963
01:42:47,610 --> 01:42:49,650
Sure, you can use my phone.

964
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:54,150
Freeze! Put your hands over your head.

965
01:42:54,780 --> 01:42:57,900
And turn around. Spread your legs.

966
01:42:58,410 --> 01:43:01,580
Spread your legs.
Put your hands in the back. Thumbs up.

967
01:43:01,710 --> 01:43:03,750
Freeze!

968
01:44:37,850 --> 01:44:40,470
Hello? Are you there?

969
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:44,010
I'm down here!

970
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:06,500
- Catherine Martin?
- Yes!

971
01:45:08,750 --> 01:45:11,580
FBI. You're safe.

972
01:45:11,710 --> 01:45:14,170
Safe, shit! Get me outta here!

973
01:45:29,890 --> 01:45:33,230
- You're all right. Where is he?
- How the fuck should I know?

974
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:37,480
- Just get me outta here!
- You gotta be quiet. Shut that dog up.

975
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,480
Just get me outta here!

976
01:45:41,530 --> 01:45:43,570
Oh, my God.

977
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:49,400
Catherine, I'm gonna get you outta there,
but right now you listen to me.

978
01:45:49,540 --> 01:45:51,790
I've gotta leave this room. Be right back.

979
01:45:51,930 --> 01:45:55,760
No! Don't you leave me here,
you fucking bitch!

980
01:45:55,890 --> 01:45:59,750
Don't you leave me here!
This guy's fucking crazy!

981
01:46:02,810 --> 01:46:04,680
Please!

982
01:46:04,810 --> 01:46:07,600
I gotta get outta here!

983
01:46:10,190 --> 01:46:14,940
Catherine, the other officers'll
be here any minute now.

984
01:46:15,070 --> 01:46:19,020
Wait! Don't go! Please!

985
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:20,400
Quiet!

986
01:50:21,270 --> 01:50:24,360
- You OK?
- Gunpowder. It's nothing. I'm OK.

987
01:50:24,490 --> 01:50:26,770
How did you track Buffalo Bill here?

988
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:35,200
Clarice M Starling.

989
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:40,080
Congratulations.

990
01:51:13,630 --> 01:51:15,830
Special Agent Starling.

991
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:18,580
- Special Agent Mapp.
- Phone call.

992
01:51:18,710 --> 01:51:20,750
- Excuse me.
- Starling.

993
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:26,170
Pilch, could you take our picture?

994
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:28,340
Yeah. Sure.

995
01:51:29,260 --> 01:51:32,300
Look, I just wanted
to say congratulations.

996
01:51:32,430 --> 01:51:36,130
I'm not much good at this kinda thing,
so I'm gonna duck outta here.

997
01:51:36,270 --> 01:51:38,310
OK. Sure.

998
01:51:39,270 --> 01:51:41,730
Thank you, Mr Crawford.

999
01:51:49,030 --> 01:51:52,230
Your father would have been proud today.

1000
01:51:54,410 --> 01:51:56,870
Don't forget your phone call.

1001
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:04,000
- Starling.
- Well, Clarice?

1002
01:52:04,590 --> 01:52:07,040
Have the lambs stopped screaming?

1003
01:52:07,470 --> 01:52:09,840
- Dr Lecter.
- Don't bother with the trace.

1004
01:52:09,970 --> 01:52:11,840
I won't be on long enough.

1005
01:52:15,430 --> 01:52:19,640
- Where are you, Dr Lecter?
- I have no plans to call on you, Clarice.

1006
01:52:19,770 --> 01:52:22,720
The world's more interesting
with you in it.

1007
01:52:22,850 --> 01:52:25,890
So you take care now
to extend me the same courtesy.

1008
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:28,480
You know I can't make that promise.

1009
01:52:28,940 --> 01:52:31,330
I do wish we could chat longer but...

1010
01:52:32,750 --> 01:52:35,620
I'm having an old friend for dinner.

1011
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:39,370
- Bye.
- Dr Lecter?

1012
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:44,420
Dr Lecter?

1013
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:55,260
Excuse me. You got
the security system all set up?

1014
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:59,610
- We have the big-shot security.
- Thank you. I appreciate that.
